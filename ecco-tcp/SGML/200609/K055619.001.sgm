<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY liberal motive that can actuate an Authour in the dedication of his labours, concurs in directing me to you, as the per&s;on to whom the fol|lowing work &s;hould be in&s;cribed.</P>
<P>If there be a plea&s;ure in celebrating the di&s;tingui&s;hed merit of a contemporary, mixed with a certain degree of vanity not altogether inexcu&s;able, in appearing fully &s;en&s;ible of it, where can I find one in compli|menting whom I can with more general approbation gratify tho&s;e feelings? Your excellence, not only in the Art over which you have long pre&s;ided with
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
unrivalled fame, but al&s;o in Philo&s;ophy and elegant Literature, is well known to the pre&s;ent, and will continue to be the admiration of future ages. Your equal and placid temper, your variety of conver|&s;ation, your true politene&s;s, by which you are &s;o amiable in private &s;ociety, and that enlarged ho&s;pitality which has long made your hou&s;e a common centre of union for the great, the accompli&s;hed, the learned, and the ingenious; all the&s;e qualities I can, in perfect confidence of not being accu&s;ed of flattery, a&s;cribe to you.</P>
<P>If a man may indulge an hone&s;t pride, in having it known to the world, that he has been thought worthy of particular attention by a per&s;on of the fir&s;t eminence in the age in which he lived, who&s;e company has been univer&s;ally courted, I am ju&s;tified in availing my&s;elf of the u&s;ual privilege of a Dedication, when I mention that there has been a long and uninterrupted friend&s;hip between us.</P>
<P>If gratitude &s;hould be acknowledged for favours received, I have this opportunity, my dear Sir, mo&s;t &s;incerely to thank you for the many happy hours which
<PB N="v" REF="5">
I owe to your kindne&s;s&mdash;for the cordiality with which you have at all times been plea&s;ed to welcome me&mdash;for the number of valuable acquaintances to whom you have introduced me&mdash;for the <HI>noctes coenaeque De&ucirc;m,</HI> which I have enjoyed under your roof.</P>
<P>If a work &s;hould be in&s;cribed to one who is ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject of it, and who&s;e approbation, therefore, mu&s;t en&s;ure it credit and &s;ucce&s;s, the Life of Dr. John&s;on is, with the greate&s;t propriety, dedicated to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who was the intimate and beloved friend of that great man; the friend, whom he declared to be <Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t invulnerable man he knew; with whom, if he &s;hould quarrel, he &s;hould find the mo&s;t difficulty how to abu&s;e."</Q> You, my dear Sir, &s;tudied him, and knew him well: you venerated and admired him. Yet, luminous as he was upon the whole, you per|ceived all the &s;hades which mingled in the grand compo&s;ition, all the little peculiarities and &s;light ble|mi&s;hes which marked the literary Colo&s;&s;us. Your very warm commendation of the &s;pecimen which I gave in my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> of my being able to pre&s;erve his conver&s;ation in an authentick and lively manner, which opinion the
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
Publick has confirmed, was the be&s;t encouragement for me to per&s;evere in my purpo&s;e of producing the whole of my &s;tores.</P>
<P>In one re&s;pect this work will in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages be different from the former. In my <Q REND="inline">"Tour"</Q> I was almo&s;t unboundedly open in my communications; and from my eagerne&s;s to di&s;play the wonderful fertility and readine&s;s of John&s;on's wit, freely &s;hewed to the world its dexterity, even when I was my&s;elf the object of it. I tru&s;ted that I &s;hould be liberally under&s;tood, as knowing very well what I was about, and by no means as &s;imply uncon&s;cious of the pointed effects of the &s;atire. I own, indeed, that I was arrogant enough to &s;uppo&s;e that the tenor of the re&s;t of the book would &s;ufficiently guard me again&s;t &s;uch a &s;trange imputation. But it &s;eems I judged too well of the world; for, though I could &s;carcely believe it, I have been undoubtedly informed, that many per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in di&s;tant quarters, not penetrating enough into John&s;on's character &s;o as to under&s;tand his mode of treating his friends, have arraigned my judgement, in&s;tead of &s;eeing that I was &s;en&s;ible of all that they could ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
It is related of the great Dr. Clarke, that when in one of his lei&s;ure hours he was unbending him&s;elf with a few friends in the mo&s;t playful and frolick&s;ome manner, he ob&s;erved Beau Na&s;h approaching; upon which he &s;uddenly &s;topped:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My boys, (&s;aid he,) let us be grave: here comes a fool."</Q> The world, my friend, I have found to be a great fool, as to that particular, on which it has become nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak very plainly. I have, therefore, in this work been more re&s;erved; and though I tell nothing but the truth, I have &s;till kept in my mind that the whole truth is not always to be expo&s;ed. This, however, I have managed &s;o as to occa&s;ion no diminution of the plea&s;ure which my book &s;hould afford; though malignity may &s;ometimes be di&s;appointed of its gratifications.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I At la&s;t deliver to the world a Work which I have long promi&s;ed, and of which, I am afraid, too high expectations have been rai&s;ed. The delay of its publication mu&s;t be imputed, in a con&s;iderable degree&punc; to the extraordinary zeal which has been &s;hewn by di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons in all quarters to &s;upply me with additional information concerning its illu&s;trious Subject; re&s;embling in this the grateful tribes of ancient nations&punc; of which every individual was eager to throw a &s;tone upon the grave of a departed Hero, and thus to &s;hare in the pious office of erecting an honourable monument to his memory.</P>
<P>The labour and anxious attention with which I have collected and arranged the materials of which the&s;e volumes are compo&s;ed, will hardly be conceived by tho&s;e who read them with carele&s;s facility. The &s;tretch of mind and prompt a&s;&s;iduity by which &s;o many conver&s;ations were pre&s;erved, I my&s;elf, at &s;ome di&s;tance of time, contemplate with wonder; and I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ugge&s;t, that the nature of the work in other re&s;pects, as it con&s;i&s;ts of innumerable detached particulars, all which, even the mo&s;t minute, I have &s;pared no pains to a&s;certain with a
<PB N="x" REF="9">
&s;crupulous authenticity, has occa&s;ioned a degree of trouble far beyond that of any other &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. Were I to detail the books which I have con&s;ulted, and the inquiries which I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to make by various channels, I &s;hould probably be thought ridiculou&s;ly o&s;tentatious. Let me only ob&s;erve, as a &s;pecimen of my trouble, that I have &s;ometimes had to run half over London, in order to fix a date correctly; which, when I had accompli&s;hed, I well knew would obtain me no prai&s;e, though a failure would have been to my di&s;credit. And after all perhaps, hard as it may be, I &s;hall not be &s;urprized if omi&s;&s;ions or mi&s;takes be pointed out with invidious &s;everity. I have al&s;o been extremely careful as to the exactne&s;s of my quotations; holding that there is a re&s;pect due to the Publick which &s;hould oblige every Author to attend to this, and never to pre&s;ume to introduce them with&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"I think I have read;"</HI></Q>&mdash;or,&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"If I remember right;"</HI></Q>&mdash;when the originals may be examined.</P>
<P>I beg leave to expre&s;s my warme&s;t thanks to tho&s;e who have been plea&s;ed to favour me with communications and advice in the conduct of my Work&punc; But I cannot &s;ufficiently acknowledge my obligations to my friend Mr. Malone, who was &s;o good as to allow me to read to him almo&s;t the whole of my manu|&s;cript, and made &s;uch remarks as were greatly for the advantage of the Work; though it is but fair to him to mention, that upon many occa&s;ions I differed from him, and followed my own judgement. I regret exceed|ingly that I was deprived of the benefit of his revi&s;ion, when but about one half of the book had pa&s;&s;ed through the pre&s;s; but after having completed his very laborious and admirable edition of Shak&s;peare, for
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
which he generou&s;ly would accept of no other reward but that fame which he has &s;o de&s;ervedly obtained, he fulfilled his promi&s;e of a long-wi&s;hed-for vi&s;it to his relations in Ireland; from whence his &s;afe return <HI>finibus Atticis</HI> is de&s;ired by his friends here, with all the cla&s;&s;ical ardour of <HI>Sic te Diva potens Cypri;</HI> for there is no man in whom more elegant and worthy qualities are united; and who&s;e &s;ociety therefore is more valued by tho&s;e who know him.</P>
<P>It is painful to me to think, that while I was carrying on this Work, &s;everal of tho&s;e to whom it would have been mo&s;t intere&s;ting have died. Such melancholy di&s;appointments we know to be incident to humanity; but we do not feel them the le&s;s. Let me particularly lament the Reverend Thomas Warton, and the Reverend Dr. Adams. Mr. Warton, amid&s;t his variety of genius and learning, was an excellent Biographer. His contributions to my Collection are highly e&s;timable; and as he had a true reli&s;h of my <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Tour to the Hebrides,"</HI></Q> I tru&s;t I &s;hould now have been gratified with a larger &s;hare of his kind approbation. Dr. Adams, eminent as the Head of a College, as a writer, and as a mo&s;t amiable man, had known John&s;on from his early years, and was his friend through life. What rea&s;on I had to hope for the countenance of that venerable Gentleman to this Work, will appear from what he wrote to me upon a former occa&s;ion from Oxford, November <HI>17, 1785:&mdash;</HI><Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, I hazard this letter, not knowing where it will find you, to thank you for your very agreeable 'Tour, which I found here on my return from the country, and in which you have depicted our friend &s;o perfectly to my fancy, in every attitude, every &s;cene and &s;ituation, that I have thought my&s;elf in the
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
company, and of the party almo&s;t throughout. It has given very general &s;atisfaction; and tho&s;e who have found mo&s;t fault with a pa&s;&s;age here and there, have agreed that they could not help going through, and being entertained through the whole. I wi&s;h, indeed, &s;ome few gro&s;s expre&s;&s;ions had been &s;oftened, and a few of our hero's foibles had been a little more &s;haded; but it is u&s;eful to &s;ee the weak|ne&s;&s;es incident to great minds; and you have given us Dr. John&s;on's authority that in hi&s;tory all ought to be told."</Q></P>
<P>Such a &s;anction to my faculty of giving a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of Dr. John&s;on I could not conceal. Nor will I &s;uppre&s;s my &s;atisfaction in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that by recording &s;o con&s;iderable a portion of the wi&s;dom and wit of <Q REND="inline"><HI>"the brighte&s;t ornament of the eighteenth century</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Malone's Preface to his edition of Shak&s;peare.</NOTE>,"</Q> I have largely provided for the in&s;truction and entertainment of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.</HEAD>
<P>TO write the life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others, and who, whether we con&s;ider his extraordinary endow|ments, or his various works, has been equalled by few in any age, is an arduous, and may be reckoned in me a pre&s;umptuous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Had Dr. John&s;on written his own life, in conformity with the opinion which he has given <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Idler&punc; No. 84.</NOTE>, that every man's life may be be&s;t written by him&s;elf; had he employed in the pre&s;ervation of his own hi&s;tory, that clearne&s;s of narration and elegance of language in which he has embalmed &s;o many eminent per|&s;ons, the world would probably have had the mo&s;t perfect example of biography that was ever exhibited. But although he at different times, in a de&s;ultory manner, committed to writing many particulars of the progre&s;s of his mind and fortunes, he never had per&s;evering diligence enough to form them into a regular compo&s;ition. Of the&s;e memorials a few have been pre&s;erved; but the greater part was con&s;igned by him to the flames, a few days before his death.</P>
<P>As I had the honour and happine&s;s of enjoying his friend&s;hip for upwards of twenty years; as I had the &s;cheme of writing his life con&s;tantly in view; as he was well appri&s;ed of this circum&s;tance, and from time to time obligingly &s;atisfied my inquiries, by communicating to me the incidents of his early years; as I acquired a facility in recollecting, and was very a&s;&s;iduous in
<PB N="2" REF="29" MS="y">
recording his conver&s;ation, of which the extraordinary vigour and vivacity con&s;tituted one of the fir&s;t features of his character; and as I have &s;pared no pains in obtaining materials concerning him, from every quarter where I could di&s;cover that they were to be found, and have been favoured with the mo&s;t liberal communications by his friends; I flatter my&s;elf that few biographers have entered upon &s;uch a work as this, with more advantages, independent of literary abilities, in which I am not vain enough to compare my&s;elf with &s;ome great names who have gone before me in this kind of writing.</P>
<P>Since my work was announced, &s;everal Lives and Memoirs of Dr. John&s;on have been publi&s;hed, the mo&s;t voluminous of which is one compiled for the Book&s;ellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The greate&s;t part of this book was written while Sir John Hawkins was alive; and I avow, that one object of my &s;trictures was to make him feel &s;ome compunction for his illi|beral treatment of Dr. John&s;on. Since his decea&s;e, I have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;everal of my remarks upon his work. But though I would not <Q REND="inline">"war with the dead"</Q> <HI>offen&s;ively,</HI> I think it nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;trenuous in <HI>defence</HI> of my illu&s;trious friend, which I cannot be, without &s;trong animadver|&s;ion upon a writer who has greatly injured him, Let me add, that though I doubt I &s;hould not have been very prompt to gratify Sir John Hawkins with any compliment in his life-time, I do now frankly acknowledge, that, in my opinion, his volume, however inadequate and improper as a life of Dr. John&s;on, and however di&s;credited by unpardonable inaccuracies in other re&s;pects, contains a collection of curious anecdotes and ob&s;ervations, which few men but its authour could have brought together.</NOTE>, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. John&s;on, I never &s;aw in his company, I think but once, and I am &s;ure not above twice. John&s;on might have e&s;teemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary hi&s;tory; but from the rigid formality of his manners, it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable ea&s;e and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was nece&s;&s;ary to mark the finer and le&s;s obvious parts of John&s;on's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch fragments of a diary and other papers as were left, of which, before deliver|ing them up to the re&s;iduary legatee, who&s;e property they were, he endea|voured to extract the &s;ub&s;tance. In this he has not been very &s;ucce&s;sful, as I have found upon a peru&s;al of tho&s;e papers, which have been &s;ince transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I mu&s;t acknowledge, exhibit a <HI>farrago,</HI> of which a con&s;iderable portion is not devoid of entertain|ment to the lovers of literary go&s;&s;iping; but be&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> its being &s;welled out
<PB N="3" REF="30" MS="y">
with long unnece&s;&s;ary extracts from various works, (even one of &s;everal leaves from O&s;borne's Harleian Catalogue, and tho&s;e not compiled by John&s;on, but by Oldys) a very &s;mall part of it relates to the per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of the book; and, in that, there is &s;uch an inaccuracy in the &s;tate|ment of facts, as in &s;o &s;olemn an authour is hardly excu&s;able, and certainly makes his narrative very un&s;atisfactory. But what is &s;till wor&s;e, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable ca&s;t, by which the mo&s;t unfavourable con&s;truction is put upon almo&s;t every circum&s;tance in the cha|racter and conduct of my illu&s;trious friend; who, I tru&s;t, will, by a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious mi&s;repre&s;entations of this authour, and from the &s;lighter a&s;per&s;ions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him.</P>
<P>There is, in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, a letter from Bi&s;hop Warburton to Dr. Birch, on the &s;ubject of biography; which, though I am aware it may expo&s;e me to a charge of artfully rai&s;ing the value of my own work, by contra&s;ting it with that of which I have &s;poken, is &s;o well conceived and expre&s;&s;ed, that I cannot refrain from here in&s;erting it:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I SHALL endeavour (&s;ays Dr. Warburton) to give you what &s;atisfaction I can in any thing you want to be &s;atisfied in any &s;ubject of Milton, and am extremely glad you intend to write his life.

</LETTER>
<P>In&s;tead of melting down my materials into one ma&s;s, and con&s;tantly &s;peak|ing in my own per&s;on, by which I might have appeared to have more merit
<PB N="4" REF="31" MS="y">
in the execution of the work, I have re&s;olved to adopt and enlarge upon the excellent plan of Mr. Ma&s;on, in his Memoirs of Gray. Wherever narra|tive is nece&s;&s;ary to explain, connect, and &s;upply, I furni&s;h it to the be&s;t of my abilities; but in the chronological &s;eries of John&s;on's life, which I trace as di&s;tinctly as I can, year by year, I produce, wherever it is in my power, his own minutes, letters, or conver&s;ation, being convinced that this mode is more lively, and will make my readers better acquainted with him, than even mo&s;t of tho&s;e were who actually knew him, but could know him only partially; whereas there is here an accumulation of intelligence from various points, by which his character is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ore fully under&s;tood and illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>Indeed I cannot conceive a more perfect mode of writing any man's life, than not only relating all the mo&s;t important events of it in their order, but interweaving what he privately wrote, and &s;aid, and thought; by which man|kind are enabled as it were to &s;ee him live, and to <Q REND="inline">"live o'er each &s;cene"</Q> with him, as he actually advanced through the &s;everal &s;tages of his life. Had his other friends been as diligent and ardent as I was, he might have been almo&s;t entirely pre&s;erved. As it is, I will venture to &s;ay that he will be &s;een in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived.</P>
<P>And he will be &s;een as he really was; for I profe&s;s to write, not his pane|gyrick, which mu&s;t be all prai&s;e, but his life; which, great and good as he was, mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be entirely perfect. To be as he was, is indeed &s;ubject of panegyrick enough to any man in this &s;tate of being; but in every picture there &s;hould be &s;hade as well as light, and when I delineate him without re&s;erve, I do what he him&s;elf recommended, both by his precept and his example:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If the biographer writes from per&s;onal knowledge, and makes ha&s;te to gratify the publick curio&s;ity, there is danger le&s;t his intere&s;t, his fear, his gratitude, or his tenderne&s;s overpower his fidelity, and tempt him to conceal, if not to invent. There are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or failings of their friends, even when they can no longer &s;uffer by their detection&punc; we therefore &s;ee whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform panegyrick, and not to be known from one another but by extrin|&s;ick and ca&s;ual circum&s;tances. 'Let me remember, (&s;ays Hale) when I find my&s;elf inclined to pity a criminal, that there is likewi&s;e a pity due to the country.' If we owe regard to the memory of the dead, there is yet more re&s;pect to be paid to knowledge, to virtue, and to truth <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Rambler, No. 60.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="32" MS="y">
What I con&s;ider as the peculiar value of the following work, is, the quan|tity that it contains of John&s;on's conver&s;ation; which is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged to have been eminently in&s;tructive and entertaining; and of which the &s;pecimens that I have given upon a former occa&s;ion, have been received with &s;o much approbation, that I have good grounds for &s;uppo&s;ing that the world will not be indifferent to more ample communications of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>That the conver&s;ation of a celebrated man, if his talents have been exerted in conver&s;ation, will be&s;t di&s;play his character, is, I tru&s;t, too well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the judgement of mankind, to be at all &s;haken by a &s;neering ob&s;ervation of Mr. Ma&s;on, in his Memoirs of Mr. William Whitehead, in which there is literally no <HI>Life,</HI> but a mere dry narrative of facts. I do not think it was quite nece&s;&s;ary to attempt a depreciation of what is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, becau&s;e it was not to be found in the immediate object of the ingenious writer's pen; for in truth, from a man &s;o &s;till and &s;o tame, as to be contented to pa&s;s many years as the dome&s;tick companion of a &s;uperannuated lord and lady, conver&s;ation worth recording could no more be expected, than from a Chine&s;e mandarin on a chimney-piece, or the fanta&s;tick figures on a gilt leather &s;kreen.</P>
<P>If authority be required, let us appeal to Plutarch, the prince of ancient biographers. <GAP DESC="foreign">. <Q REND="inline">"Nor is it always in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed atchievements that men's virtues or vices may be be&s;t di&s;cerned; but very often an action of &s;mall note, a &s;hort &s;aying, or a je&s;t, &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h a per&s;on's real character more than the greate&s;t &s;ieges, or the mo&s;t important battles <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Plutarch's Life of Alexander.&mdash;Langhorne's Tran&s;lation.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>To this may be added the &s;entiments of the very man who&s;e life I am am about to exhibit. <Q REND="inline">"The bu&s;ine&s;s of the biographer is often to pa&s;s &s;lightly over tho&s;e performances and incidents which produce vulgar great|ne&s;s, to lead the thoughts into dome&s;tick privacies, and di&s;play the minute details of daily life, where exterior appendages are ca&s;t a&s;ide, and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue. The account of Thuanus is with great propriety &s;aid by its authour to have been written, that it might lay open to po&s;terity the private and familiar character of that man, <HI>cujus ingenium et candorem ex ip&s;ius &s;criptis &s;unt olim &s;emper miraturi,</HI> who&s;e candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings pre&s;erved in admiration.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="6" REF="33" MS="y">
<P>There are many invi&s;ible circum&s;tances, which whether we read as enqui|rers after natural or moral knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our &s;cience, or increa&s;e our virtue, are more important than publick occur|rences. Thus Sallu&s;t, the great ma&s;ter of nature, has not forgot in his account of Catiline to remark, that his walk was now quick, and again &s;low, as an indication of a mind revolving with violent commotion. Thus the &s;tory of Melancthon affords a &s;triking lecture on the value of time, by in|forming us, that when he had made an appointment, he expected not only the hour, but the minute to be fixed, that the day might not run out in the idlene&s;s of &s;u&s;pence; and all the plans and enterprizes of De Wit are now of le&s;s importance to the world than that part of his per&s;onal character, which repre&s;ents him as careful of his health, and negligent of his life.</P>
<P>But biography has often been allotted to writers, who &s;eem&punc; very little acquainted with the nature of their ta&s;k, or very negligent about the per|formance. They rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers, but imagine them&s;elves writing a life, when they exhibit a chronological &s;eries of actions or preferments; and have &s;o little regard to the manners or behaviour of their heroes, that more knowledge may be gained of a man's real character, by a &s;hort conver&s;ation with one of his &s;ervants, than from a formal and &s;tudied narrative, begun with his pedigree, and ended with his funeral.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, &s;ome natural rea&s;ons why the&s;e narratives are often written by &s;uch as were not likely to give much in&s;truction or delight, and why mo&s;t accounts of particular per&s;ons are barren and u&s;ele&s;s. If a life be delayed till intere&s;t and envy are at an end, we may hope for impartiality, but mu&s;t expect little intelligence; for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evane&s;cent kind, &s;uch as &s;oon e&s;cape the memory, and are tran&s;mitted by tradition. We know how few can pour|tray a living acquaintance, except by his mo&s;t prominent and ob&s;er|vable particularities, and the gro&s;&s;er features of his mind; and it may be ea&s;ily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lo&s;t in impart|ing it, and how &s;oon a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of copies will lo&s;e all re&s;emblance of the original <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Rambler, No. 60.</NOTE>.</P></Q>
<P>I am fully aware of the objections which may be made to the minutene&s;s on &s;ome occa&s;ions of my detail of John&s;on's conver&s;ation, and how happily it is
<PB N="7" REF="34">
adapted for the petty exerci&s;e of ridicule by men of &s;uperficial under&s;tanding, and ludicrous fancy; but I remain firm and confident in my opinion, that minute particulars are frequently characteri&s;tick, and always amu&s;ing, when they relate to a di&s;tingui&s;hed man. I am therefore exceedingly unwilling that almo&s;t any thing which my illu&s;trious friend thought it worth his while to expre&s;s, with any degree of point, &s;hould peri&s;h. For this almo&s;t &s;uper|&s;titious reverence, I have found very old and venerable authority, quoted by our great modern prelate, Secker, in who&s;e tenth &s;ermon there is the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>"Rabbi David Kimchi,</HI> a noted Jewi&s;h commentator who lived above five hundred years ago, explains that pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t P&s;alm, <HI>His leaf al&s;o &s;hall not wither,</HI> from Rabbins yet older than him&s;elf, thus: That <HI>even the idle talk,</HI> &s;o he expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>of a good man ought to be regarded;</HI> the mo&s;t &s;uper|fluous things he &s;aith are always of &s;ome value. And other ancient authours have the &s;ame phra&s;e, nearly in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Of one thing I am certain, that con&s;idering how highly the &s;mall portion which we have of the table-talk and other anecdotes of our celebrated writers is valued, and how earne&s;tly it is regretted that we have not more, I am ju&s;tified in pre&s;erving rather too many of John&s;on's &s;ayings than too few; e&s;pecially as from the diver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;itions it cannot be known with cer|tainty beforehand, whether what may &s;eem trifling to &s;ome, and perhaps to the collector him&s;elf, may not be mo&s;t agreeable to many; and the greater number that an authour can plea&s;e in any degree, the more plea&s;ure does there ari&s;e to a benevolent mind.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are weak enough to think this a degrading ta&s;k, and the time and labour which have been devoted to it mi&s;employed, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with oppo&s;ing the authority of the greate&s;t man of any age, JULIUS CAESAR, of whom Bacon ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">"in his book of Apothegms which he collected, we &s;ee that he e&s;teemed it more honour to make him&s;elf but a pair of tables, to take the wi&s;e and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his own to be made an apothegm or an oracle <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Bacon's Advancement of Learning, Book I.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

<MILESTONE N="1709"> SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield, in Stafford&s;hire, on the 18th of September, N. S. 1709; and his initiation into the Chri&s;tian church was not delayed; for his bapti&s;m is recorded, in the regi&s;ter of St. Mary's pari&s;h in that city, to have been performed on the day of his birth: His father is there &s;tiled <HI>Gentleman,</HI> a circum&s;tance of which an ignorant panegyri&s;t has prai&s;ed him for not being proud; when the truth is, that the appellation of Gentle|man, though now lo&s;t in the indi&s;criminate a&s;&s;umption of <HI>E&s;quire,</HI> was com|monly taken by tho&s;e who could not boa&s;t of gentility. His father was Michael John&s;on, a native of Derby&s;hire, of ob&s;cure extraction, who &s;ettled in Lichfield as a book&s;eller and &s;tationer. His mother was Sarah Ford, de&s;cended of an ancient race of &s;ub&s;tantial yeomanry in Warwick&s;hire. They were well advanced in years when they married, and never had more than two children, both &s;ons; Samuel, their fir&s;t born, who lived to be the illu&s;trious character who&s;e various excellence I am to endeavour to record, and Nathanael, who died in his twenty-fifth year.</P>
<P>Mr. Michael John&s;on was a man of a large and robu&s;t body, and of a &s;trong and active mind; yet, as in the mo&s;t &s;olid rocks veins of un&s;ound &s;ub|&s;tance are often di&s;covered, there was in him a mixture of that di&s;ea&s;e, the nature of which eludes the mo&s;t minute enquiry, though the effects are well known to be a wearine&s;s of life, an unconcern about tho&s;e things which agitate the greater part of mankind, and a general &s;en&s;ation of gloomy wretchedne&s;s.

At that time book&s;ellers' &s;hops in the provincial towns of England were very rare, &s;o that there was not one even in Birmingham, in which town old Mr. John&s;on u&s;ed to open a &s;hop every market-day. He was a pretty good Latin &s;cholar, and a citizen &s;o creditable as to be made one of the magi&s;trates of Lichfield; and, being a man of good &s;en&s;e, and &s;kill in his trade, he acquired a rea&s;onable &s;hare of wealth, of which however he afterwards lo&s;t the greate&s;t part, by engaging un&s;ucce&s;sfully in a manufacture of parchment. He was a zealous high-churchman and royali&s;t, and retained his attachment to the unfortunate hou&s;e of Stuart, though he reconciled him&s;elf, by ca&s;ui&s;tical arguments of expediency and nece&s;&s;ity, to take the oaths impo&s;ed by the pre|vailing power.</P>

There is a circum&s;tance in his life &s;omewhat romantick, but &s;o well authenticated, that I &s;hall not omit it. A young woman of Leek, in Stafford&s;hire, while he &s;erved his apprentice&s;hip there, conceived a violent pa&s;&s;ion for him; and though it met with no favourable return, followed him to Lichfield, where &s;he took lodgings oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e in which he lived, and indulged her hopele&s;s flame. When he was informed that it &s;o preyed upon her mind that her life was in danger, he with a generous humanity went to her and offered to marry her, but it was then too late: Her vital power was exhau&s;ted; and &s;he actually exhibited one of the very rare in&s;tances of dying for love. She was buried in the cathedral of Lichfield; and he, with a tender regard, placed a &s;tone over her grave with this in&s;cription:</P>

<P>John&s;on's mother was a woman of di&s;tingui&s;hed under&s;tanding. I a&s;ked his old &s;chool-fellow Mr. Hector, &s;urgeon, of Birmingham, if &s;he was not vain of her &s;on.

<MILESTONE N="1712. Aetat. 3."> who&s;e hi&s;tory has been minutely related, that did not in every part of life di&s;cover the &s;ame proportion of intellectual vigour."</Q></P>
<P>In all &s;uch inve&s;tigations it is certainly unwi&s;e to pay too much attention to incidents which the credulous relate with eager &s;atisfaction, and the more &s;crupulous or witty enquirer con&s;iders only as topicks of ridicule: Yet there is a traditional &s;tory of the infant Hercules of toryi&s;m, &s;o curiou&s;ly charac|teri&s;tick, that I &s;hall not withold it. It was communicated to me in a letter from Mi&s;s Mary Adye, of Lichfield.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When Dr. Sacheverel was at Lichfield, John&s;on was not quite three years old. My grandfather Hammond ob&s;erved him at the cathedral perched upon his father's &s;houlders, li&s;tening, and gaping at the much celebrated preacher. Mr. Hammond a&s;ked Mr. John&s;on how he could po&s;&s;ibly think of bringing &s;uch an infant to church, and in the mid&s;t of &s;o great a croud. He an&s;wered, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep him at home; for, young as he was, he believed he had caught the publick &s;pirit and zeal for Sacheverel, and would have &s;taid for ever in the church, &s;atisfied with beholding him."</Q></P>
<P>Nor can I omit a little in&s;tance of that jealous independence of &s;pirit, and impetuo&s;ity of temper, which never for&s;ook him. The fact was acknow|ledged to me by him&s;elf, upon the authority of his mother. One day, when the &s;ervant who u&s;ed to be &s;ent to &s;chool to conduct him home, had not come in time, he &s;et out by him&s;elf, though he was then &s;o near-&s;ighted, that he was obliged to &s;toop down on his hands and knees to take a view of the kennel before he ventured to &s;tep over it. His &s;choolmi&s;tre&s;s, afraid that he might mi&s;s his way, or fall into the kennel, or be run over by a cart, followed him at &s;ome di&s;tance. He happened to turn about and perceive her. Feel|ing her careful attention as an in&s;ult to his manline&s;s, he ran back to her in a rage, and beat her, as well as his &s;trength would permit.</P>
<P>Of the &s;trength of his memory, for which he was all his life eminent to a degree almo&s;t incredible, the following early in&s;tance was told me in his pre&s;ence at Lichfield, in 1776, by his &s;tep-daughter, Mrs. Lucy Porter, as related to her by his mother. When he was a child in petticoats, and had learnt to read, Mrs. John&s;on one morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sam, you mu&s;t get this by heart."</Q> She went up &s;tairs, leaving him to &s;tudy it: But by the time &s;he had reached the &s;econd floor, &s;he heard him following her. <Q REND="inline">"What's the matter?"</Q> &s;aid &s;he. <Q REND="inline">"I can &s;ay it,"</Q> he replied; and repeated it di&s;tinctly, though he could not have read it over more than twice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="38" MS="y">
But there has been another &s;tory of his infant precocity generally circulated, and generally believed, the truth of which I am to refute upon his own authority. It is told <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of Dr. John&s;on by He&s;ter Lynch Piozzi, p. 11.&mdash;Life of Dr. John&s;on by Sir John Hawkins. p. 6.</NOTE>, that, when a child of three years old, he chanced to tread upon a duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and killed it; upon which, it is &s;aid, he dictated to his mother the following epitaph:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Here lies good ma&s;ter duck,</L>
<L>Whom Samuel John&s;on trod on;</L>
<L>If it had liv'd, it had been <HI>good luck,</HI></L>
<L>For then we'd had an <HI>odd one."</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
<P>There is &s;urely internal evidence that this little compo&s;ition combines in it, what no child of three years old could produce, without an exten&s;ion of its faculties by immediate in&s;piration; yet Mrs. Lucy Porter, Dr. John&s;on's &s;tep-daughter, po&s;itively maintained to me, in his pre&s;ence, that there could be no doubt of the truth of this anecdote, for &s;he had heard it from his mother. So difficult is it to obtain an authentick relation of facts, and &s;uch authority may there be for errour; for he a&s;&s;ured me, that his father made the ver&s;es, and wi&s;hed to pa&s;s them for his child's. He added, <Q REND="inline">"my father was a fooli&s;h old man; that is to &s;ay, fooli&s;h in talking of his children <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This anecdote of the duck, though di&s;proved by internal and external evidence, has never|thele&s;s, upon &s;uppo&s;ition of its truth, been made the foundation of the following ingenious and fanciful reflections by Mi&s;s Seward, among&s;t the communications concerning Dr. John&s;on with which &s;he has been plea&s;ed to favour me.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e infant numbers contain the &s;eeds of tho&s;e propen&s;ities which through his life &s;o &s;trongly marked his character, of that poetick talent which afterwards bore &s;uch rich and plentiful fruits; for, excepting his orthographick works, every thing which Dr. John&s;on wrote was Poetry, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence con&s;i&s;ts not in numbers, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in jingle, but in the &s;trength and glow of a fancy, to which all the &s;tores of nature and of art &s;tand in prompt admini&s;tration; and in an eloquence which conveys their blended illu&s;trations in a lan|guage 'more tuneable than needs or rhyme or ver&s;e to add more harmony.'</Q></P>

<P>Young John&s;on had the misfortune to be much afflicted with the &s;crophula, or king's evil, which disfigured a countenance naturally well formed, and
<PB N="12" REF="39" MS="y">
hurt his vi&s;ual nerves &s;o much, that he did not &s;ee at all with one of his eyes, though its appearance was little different from that of the other. There is among&s;t his prayers, one in&s;cribed <Q REND="inline"><HI>"When my</HI> EYE <HI>was re&s;tored to its u&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 27.</NOTE>,"</Q> which a&s;certains a defect that many of his friends knew he had, though I never perceived it. I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be only near-&s;ighted; and indeed I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in no other re&s;pect could I di&s;cern any defect in his vi&s;ion; on the contrary, the force of his attention and perceptive quick|ne&s;s made him &s;ee and di&s;tingui&s;h all manner of objects, whether of nature or of art, with a nicety that is rarely to be found. When he and I were travelling in the Highlands of Scotland, and I pointed out to him a moun|tain which I ob&s;erved re&s;embled a cone, he corrected my inaccuracy by &s;hewing me, that it was indeed pointed at the top, but that one &s;ide of it was larger than the other. And the ladies with whom he was acquainted agree, that no man was more nicely and minutely critical in the elegance of female dre&s;s. When I found that he &s;aw the romantick beauties of I&s;lam, in Derby&s;hire, much better than I did, I told him that he re&s;embled an able performer upon a bad in&s;trument. How fal&s;e and contemp|tible then are all the remarks which have been made to the prejudice either of his candour or of his philo&s;ophy, founded upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that he was almo&s;t blind. It has been &s;aid, that he contracted this grievous malady from his nur&s;e. His mother yielding to the &s;uper&s;titious notion, which, it is wonderful to think, prevailed &s;o long in this country, as to the virtue of the regal touch; a notion, which our kings encouraged, and to which a man of &s;uch inquiry and &s;uch judgement as Carte could give credit&punc; carried him to London, where he was actually touched by Queen Anne. Mrs. John&s;on indeed, as Mr. Hector informed me, acted by the advice of the celebrated Sir John Floyer, then a phy&s;ician in Lichfield. John&s;on u&s;ed to talk of this very frankly; and Mrs. Piozzi has pre&s;erved his very picture&s;que de&s;cription of the &s;cene, as it remained upon his fancy. Being a&s;ked if he could remember Queen Anne, <Q REND="inline">"He had (he &s;aid) a confu&s;ed, but &s;omehow a &s;ort of &s;olemn recollection of a lady in diamonds, and a long black hood <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes, p. 10.</NOTE>."</Q> This touch, however, was without any effect. I ventured to &s;ay to him, in allu&s;ion to the political principles in which he was educated, and of which he ever retained &s;ome odour, that <Q REND="inline">"his mother had not carried him far enough; &s;he &s;hould have taken him to ROME."</Q></P>
<P>He was fir&s;t taught to read Engli&s;h by Dame Oliver, a widow, who kept a &s;chool for young children in Lichfield. He told me &s;he could read the
<PB N="13" REF="40">
black letter, and a&s;ked him to borrow for her, from his father, a bible in that character. When he was going to Oxford, &s;he came to take leave of him, brought him, in the &s;implicity of her kindne&s;s, a pre&s;ent of ginger|bread, and &s;aid he was the be&s;t &s;cholar &s;he had ever had. He delighted in mentioning this early compliment; adding, with a &s;mile, that <Q REND="inline">"this was as high a proof of his merit as he could conceive."</Q> His next in&s;tructor in Engli&s;h was a ma&s;ter, whom, when he &s;poke of him to me, he fami|liarly called Tom Brown, who, &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"publi&s;hed a &s;pelling-book, and dedicated it to the UNIVERSE;&mdash;but, I fear, no copy of it can now be had."</Q></P>
<P>He began to learn Latin with Mr. Hawkins, u&s;her, or under-ma&s;ter of Lichfield &s;chool, <Q REND="inline">"a man (&s;aid he) very &s;kilful in his little way."</Q> With him he continued two years, and then ro&s;e to be under the care of Mr. Hunter the head-ma&s;ter, who, according to his account, <Q REND="inline">"was very &s;evere, and wrong-headedly &s;evere. He u&s;ed (&s;aid he) to beat us unmercifully; and he did not di&s;tingui&s;h between ignorance and negligence; for he would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing, as for neglecting to know it. He would a&s;k a boy a que&s;tion; and if he did not an&s;wer it, he would beat him, without con&s;idering whether he had an opportunity of knowing how to an&s;wer it. For in&s;tance, he would call up a boy and a&s;k him Latin for a candle&s;tick, which the boy could not expect to be a&s;ked. Now, Sir, if a boy could an&s;wer every que&s;tion, there would be no need of a ma&s;ter to teach him."</Q></P>
<P>It is, however, but ju&s;tice to the memory of Mr. Hunter to mention, that though he might err in being too &s;evere&punc; the &s;chool of Lichfield was very re&s;pectable in his time. The late Dr. Taylor, Prebendary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who was educated under him, told me, that he was an excellent ma&s;ter, and that his u&s;hers were mo&s;t of them men of eminence; that Holbrook, one of the mo&s;t ingenious men, be&s;t &s;cholars, and be&s;t preachers of hi&s; age, was u&s;her during the greate&s;t part of the time that John&s;on was at &s;chool. Then came Hague, of whom as much might be &s;aid, with the addition that he was an elegant poet. Hague was &s;ucceeded by Green, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who&s;e character in the learned world is well known. In the &s;ame form with John&s;on was Congreve, who afterwards became chaplain to Arch|bi&s;hop Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, and by that connection obtained good preferment in Ireland. He was a younger &s;on of the ancient family of Congreve, in Sta&s;&s;ord&s;hire, of which the poet was a branch. His brother &s;old the e&s;tate. There was al&s;o
<PB N="14" REF="41" MS="y">
Lowe, afterwards Canon of Wind&s;or; who was tutor to the pre&s;ent Marquis Town&s;hend, and his brother Charles.</P>
<P>Indeed John&s;on was very &s;en&s;ible how much he owed to Mr. Hunter. Mr. Langton one day a&s;ked him how he had acquired &s;o accurate a know|ledge of Latin, in which, I believe, he was exceeded by no man of his time&punc; he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My ma&s;ter whipt me very well. Without that, Sir, I &s;hould have done nothing."</Q> He told Mr. Langton, that while Hunter was flogging his boys unmercifully, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"And this I do to &s;ave you from the gallows."</Q> John&s;on, upon all occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of enforcing in&s;truction by means of the rod. <Q REND="inline">"I would rather (&s;aid he) have the rod to be the general terrour to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus, or thus, you will be more e&s;teemed than your brothers or &s;i&s;ters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in it&s;elf. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his ta&s;k, and there's an end on't; whereas, by exciting emulation and compari&s;ons of &s;uperiority, you lay the foundation of la&s;ting mi&s;chief; you make brothers and &s;i&s;ters hate each other."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Langton told me, that when John&s;on &s;aw &s;ome young ladies in Lin|coln&s;hire who were remarkably well behaved, owing to their mother's &s;trict di&s;cipline and &s;evere correction, he exclaimed, in one of Shak&s;peare's lines a little varied, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Rod,</HI> I will honour thee for this thy duty."</Q></P>
<P>That &s;uperiority over his fellows, which he maintained with &s;o much dig|nity in his march through life, was not a&s;&s;umed from vanity and o&s;tentation, but was the natural and con&s;tant effect of tho&s;e extraordinary powers of mind, of which he could not but be con&s;cious by compari&s;on; the intellectual difference, which in other ca&s;es of compari&s;on of characters is often a matter of undecided conte&s;t, being as clear in his ca&s;e as the &s;uperiority of &s;tature in &s;ome men above others. John&s;on did not &s;trut or &s;tand on tip-toe: He only did not &s;toop. From his earlie&s;t years, his &s;uperiority was perceived and acknowledged. He was from the beginning <GAP DESC="foreign">, a king of men. His &s;choolfellow, Mr. Hector, has obligingly furni&s;hed me with many par|ticulars of his boyi&s;h days; and a&s;&s;ured me, that he never knew him corrected at &s;chool, but for talking and diverting other boys from their bu&s;ine&s;s. He &s;eemed to learn by intuition; for though indolence and pro|cra&s;tination were inherent in his con&s;titution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one el&s;e. In &s;hort, he is a memorable in&s;tance of what has been often ob&s;erved, that the boy is the man in miniature; and that the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;ticks of each individual are the &s;ame, through the whole cour&s;e of life. His favourites u&s;ed to receive very liberal a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="15" REF="42" MS="y">
from him; and &s;uch was the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and deference with which he was treated, &s;uch the de&s;ire to obtain his regard, that three of the boys, of whom Mr. Hector was &s;ometimes one, u&s;ed to come in the morning as his humble attendants, and carry him to &s;chool. One in the middle &s;tooped, while he &s;at upon his back, and one on each &s;ide &s;upported him; and thus he was borne triumphant. Such a proof of the early predominance of intellectual vigour is very remarkable, and does honour to human nature. Talking to me once him&s;elf of his being much di&s;tingui&s;hed at &s;chool, he told me, <Q REND="inline">"they never thought to rai&s;e me by comparing me to any one; they never &s;aid, John&s;on is as good a &s;cholar as &s;uch a one; but &s;uch a one is as good a &s;cholar as John&s;on; and this was &s;aid but of one, but of Lowe; and I do not think he was as good a &s;cholar."</Q></P>
<P>He di&s;covered a great ambition to excel, which rou&s;ed him to counteract his indolence. He was uncommonly inqui&s;itive; and his memory was &s;o tenacious, that he never forgot any thing that he either heard or read. Mr. Hector remembers having recited to him eighteen ver&s;es, which, after a little pau&s;e, he repeated <HI>verbatim,</HI> varying only one epithet, by which he improved the line.</P>
<P>He never joined with the other boys in their ordinary diver&s;ions; his only amu&s;ement was in winter, when he took a plea&s;ure in being drawn upon the ice by a boy barefooted, who pulled him along by a garter fixed round him; no very ea&s;y operation, as his &s;ize was remarkably large. His defective &s;ight, indeed, prevented him from enjoying the common &s;ports; and he once plea&s;antly remarked to me, how wonderfully well he had contrived to be idle without them. Lord Che&s;terfield, however, has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved in one of his letters, when earne&s;tly cautioning a friend again&s;t the pernicious effects of idlene&s;s, that active &s;ports are not to be reckoned idlene&s;s in young people; and that the li&s;tle&s;s torpor of doing nothing, alone de&s;erves that name. Of this di&s;mal inertne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, John&s;on had all his life too great a &s;hare. Mr. Hector relates, that <Q REND="inline">"he could not oblige him more than by &s;auntering away the hours of vacation in the fields, during which he was more engaged in talking to him&s;elf than to his companion."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Percy, the Bi&s;hop of Dromore, who was long intimately acquainted with him, and has pre&s;erved a few anecdotes concerning him, regretting that he was not a more diligent collector, informs me, that <Q REND="inline">"when a boy he was immoderately fond of reading romances of chivalry, and he retained his fond|ne&s;s for them through life; &s;o that (adds his Lord&s;hip) &s;pending part of a &s;ummer at my par&s;onage-hou&s;e in the country, he cho&s;e for his regular read|ing

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1728">
<P><MILESTONE N="1728. Aetat. 19."> The two years which he &s;pent at home, after his return from Stourbridge, he pa&s;&s;ed in what he thought idlene&s;s, and was &s;colded by his father for his want of &s;teady application. He had no &s;ettled plan of life, nor looked forward at all, but merely lived from day to day. Yet he read a great deal in a de&s;ultory manner, without any &s;cheme of &s;tudy, as chance threw books in his way, and inclination directed him through them. He u&s;ed to mention one curious in&s;tance of his ca&s;ual reading, when but a boy. Having imagined that his brother had hid &s;ome apples behind a large folio upon an upper &s;helf in his father's &s;hop, he climbed up to &s;earch for them. There were no apples; but the large folio proved to be Petrarch, whom he had &s;een mentioned, in &s;ome preface, as one of the re&s;torers of learning. His curio&s;ity having been thus excited, he &s;at down with avidity, and read a great part of the book. What he read during the&s;e two years, he told me, was not works of mere amu&s;ement, <Q REND="inline">"not voyages and travels, but all literature, Sir, all ancient writers, all manly; though but little Greek, only &s;ome of Anacreon and He&s;iod; but in this irregular manner (added he) I had looked into a great many books, which were not commonly known at the Univer|&s;ities,
<PB N="24" REF="53">
 where they &s;eldom read any books but what are put into their hands by their tutors; &s;o that when I came to Oxford, Dr. Adams, ma&s;ter of Pembroke College, told me, I was the be&s;t qualified for the Univer&s;ity that he had ever known come there."</Q></P>
<P>In e&s;timating the progre&s;s of his mind during the&s;e two years, as well as in future periods of his life, we mu&s;t not regard his own ha&s;ty confe&s;&s;ion of idlene&s;s; for we &s;ee, when he explains him&s;elf, that he was acquiring various &s;tores; and, indeed, he him&s;elf concluded the account, with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I would not have you think I was doing nothing then."</Q> He might, perhaps, have &s;tudied more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly; but it may be doubted, whether &s;uch a mind as his was not more enriched by roaming at large in the fields of literature, than if it had been confined to any &s;ingle &s;pot. The analogy between body and mind is very general, and the parallel will hold as to their food, as well as any other particular. The fle&s;h of animals who feed excur&s;ively, is allowed to have a higher flavour than that of tho&s;e who are cooped up. May there not be the &s;ame difference between men who read as their ta&s;te prompts, and men who are confined in cells and colleges to &s;tated ta&s;ks?</P>
<P>That a man in Mr. Michael John&s;on's circum&s;tances &s;hould think of &s;end|ing his &s;on to the expen&s;ive Univer&s;ity of Oxford, at his own charge, &s;eems very improbable. The &s;ubject was too delicate to que&s;tion John&s;on upon: But I have been a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Taylor, that the &s;cheme never would have taken place, had not a gentleman of Shrop&s;hire, one of his &s;choolfellows, &s;pontaneou&s;ly undertaken to &s;upport him at Oxford, in the character of his companion; though, in fact, he never received any a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever from that gentleman.</P>
<P>He, however, went to Oxford, and was entered a Commoner of Pembroke College, on the 31&s;t of October, 1728, being then in his nineteenth year.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. Adams, who afterwards pre&s;ided over Pembroke College with univer&s;al e&s;teem, told me he was pre&s;ent, and gave me &s;ome account of what pa&s;&s;ed on the night of John&s;on's arrival at Oxford. On that evening, his father, who had anxiou&s;ly accompanied him, found means to have him introduced to Mr. Jorden, who was to be his tutor. His being put under any tutor, reminds us of what Wood &s;ays of Robert Burton, authour of the <Q REND="inline">"Anatomy of Melancholy,"</Q> when elected &s;tudent of Chri&s;t Church; <Q REND="inline">"for form's &s;ake, <HI>though he wanted not a tutor,</HI> he was put under the tuition of Dr. John Bancroft, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Oxon <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. edit. 1721. p. 628.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="54" MS="y">
His father &s;eemed very full of the merits of his &s;on, and told the company he was a good &s;cholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin ver&s;es. His figure and manner appeared &s;trange to them; but he behaved mode&s;tly, and sat &s;ilent, till upon &s;omething which occurred in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, he &s;uddenly &s;truck in and quoted Macrobius; and thus he gave the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of that more exten&s;ive reading in which he had indulged him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His tutor, Mr. Jorden, fellow of Pembroke, was not, it &s;eems, a man of &s;uch abilities as we &s;hould conceive requi&s;ite for the in&s;tructor of Samuel John&s;on, who gave me the following account of him. <Q REND="inline">"He was a very worthy man, but a heavy man, and I did not profit much by his in&s;tructions. Indeed, I did not attend him much. The fir&s;t day after I came to college, I waited upon him, and then &s;taid away four. On the &s;ixth, Mr. Jorden a&s;ked me why I had not attended. I an&s;wered, I had been &s;liding in Chri&s;t-Church meadow. And this I &s;aid with as much <HI>non-chalance</HI> as I am now<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Oxford, 20th March, 1776.</NOTE> talking to you. I had no notion that I was wrong or irreverent to my tutor."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, was great fortitude of mind."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir&punc; &s;tark in&s;en&s;ibility <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">It ought to be remembered, that Dr. John&s;on was apt, in his literary as well as moral exer|ci&s;es, to overcharge his defects. Dr. Adams informed me, that he attended his tutor's lectures, and al&s;o the lectures in the College Hall, very regularly.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The fifth of November was at that time kept with great &s;olemnity at Pembroke College, and exerci&s;es upon the &s;ubject of the day were required. John&s;on neglected to perform his, which is much to be regretted; for his vivacity of imagination, and force of language, would probably have pro|duced &s;omething &s;ublime upon the gunpowder plot. To apologi&s;e for his neglect, he gave in a &s;hort copy of ver&s;es, entitled <HI>Somnium,</HI> containing a common thought; <Q REND="inline">"that the Mu&s;e had come to him in his &s;leep, and whi&s;|pered that it did not become him to write on &s;uch &s;ubjects as politicks; he &s;hould confine him&s;elf to humbler themes:"</Q> but the ver&s;ification was truly Virgilian.</P>
<P>He had a love and re&s;pect for Jorden, not for his literature, but for his worth. <Q REND="inline">"Whenever (&s;aid he) a young man becomes Jorden's pupil, he becomes his &s;on."</Q></P>
<P>Having given &s;uch a &s;pecimen of his poetical powers, he was a&s;ked by Mr. Jorden to tran&s;late Pope's Me&s;&s;iah into Latin ver&s;e, as a Chri&s;tmas exer|ci&s;e. He performed it with uncommon rapidity, and in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner,
<PB N="26" REF="55">
 that he obtained great applau&s;e from it, which ever after kept him high in the e&s;timation of his College, and, indeed, of all the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that Mr. Pope expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf concerning it in terms of &s;trong approbation. Dr. Taylor told me, that it was fir&s;t printed for old Mr. John&s;on, without the knowledge of his &s;on, who was very angry when he heard of it. A mi&s;cellany of Poems, collected by a per&s;on of the name of Hu&s;bands, was publi&s;hed at Oxford in 1731. In that mi&s;cellany John&s;on's Tran&s;lation of the Me&s;&s;iah appeared, with this mode&s;t motto from Scaliger's Poeticks, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Ex alieno ingenio Poeta, ex &s;uo tantum ver&s;ificator."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am not ignorant that critical objections have been made to this and other &s;pecimens of John&s;on's Latin Poetry. I acknowledge my&s;elf not competent to decide on a que&s;tion of &s;uch extreme nicety. But I am &s;atisfied with the ju&s;t and di&s;criminative eulogy pronounced upon it by my friend Mr. Courtenay.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1729">
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"morbid melancholy"</Q> which was lurking in his con&s;titution, and to which we may a&s;cribe tho&s;e particularities, and that aver&s;ion to regular life, which, at a very early period, marked his character, gathered &s;uch &s;trength in his twentieth year, as to afflict him in a dreadful manner. While he was at Lichfield, in the College vacation of the year 1729, he felt him|&s;elf overwhelmed with an horrible hypochondria, with perpetual irritation, fretfulne&s;s, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and de&s;pair, which made exi&s;tence mi&s;ery. From this di&s;mal malady he never afterwards was perfectly relieved; and all his labours, and all his enjoyments, were but tem|porary interruptions of its baleful influence. How wonderful, how un&s;earch|able are the ways of GOD! John&s;on, who was ble&s;t with all the powers of genius and under&s;tanding in a degree far above the ordinary &s;tate of human nature, was at the &s;ame time vi&s;ited with a di&s;order &s;o afflictive, that they who know it by dire experience, will not envy his exalted endowments. That it was, in &s;ome degree, occa&s;ioned by a defect in his nervous &s;y&s;tem, that inex|plicable part of our frame, appears highly probable. He told Mr. Paradi&s;e that he was &s;ometimes &s;o languid and inefficient, that he could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h the hour upon the town-clock.</P>
<P>John&s;on, upon the fir&s;t violent attack of this di&s;order, &s;trove to overcome it by forcible exertions. He frequently walked to Birmingham and back again, and tried many other expedients, but all in vain. His expre&s;&s;ion concerning it to me was, <Q REND="inline">"I did not then know how to manage it."</Q> His di&s;tre&s;s became &s;o intolerable, that he applied to Dr. Swinfen, phy&s;ician in Lichfield, his godfather, and put into his hands a &s;tate of his ca&s;e, written in Latin. Dr. Swinfen was &s;o much &s;truck with the extraordinary acutene&s;s, re&s;earch, and eloquence of this paper, that in his zeal for his god&s;on he &s;hewed it to &s;everal people. His daughter, Mrs. De&s;moulins, who was many years humanely &s;upported in Dr. John&s;on's hou&s;e in London, told me, that upon his di&s;covering that Dr. Swinfen had communicated his ca&s;e, he was &s;o much offended, that he was never afterwards fully reconciled to him. He indeed had good rea&s;on to be offended; for though Dr. Swinfen's motive was good, he incon&s;iderately betrayed a matter deeply intere&s;ting and of great delicacy, which had been entru&s;ted to him in confidence; and expo&s;ed a
<PB N="28" REF="57"> complaint of his young friend and patient, which, in the &s;uperficial opinion of the generality of mankind, is attended with contempt and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>But let not little men triumph upon knowing that John&s;on was an HYPOCHONDRIACK, was &s;ubject to what the learned, philo&s;ophical, and pious Dr. Cheyne has &s;o well treated, under the title of <Q REND="inline">"The Engli&s;h Malady."</Q> Though he &s;uffered &s;ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ely from it, he was not therefore degraded. The powers of his great mind might be troubled, and their full exerci&s;e &s;u&s;pended at times, but the mind it&s;elf was ever entire. As a proof of this, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, that, when he was at the very wor&s;t, he compo&s;ed that &s;tate of his own ca&s;e, which &s;hewed an uncommon vigour, not only of fancy and ta&s;te, but of judgement. I am aware that he him&s;elf was too ready to call &s;uch a complaint by the name of <HI>madne&s;s;</HI> in conformity with which notion, he has traced its gradations, with exqui&s;ite nicety, in one of the chapters of his RASSELAS. But there is &s;urely a clear di&s;tinction between a di&s;order which affects only the imagination and &s;pirits, while the judge|ment is &s;ound, and a di&s;order by which the judgement it&s;elf is impaired. This di&s;tinction was made to me by the late Profe&s;&s;or Gaubius of Leyden, phy&s;ician to the Prince of Orange, in a conver&s;ation which I had with him &s;everal years ago, and he expanded it thus: <Q REND="inline">"If (&s;aid he) a man tells me that he is grievou&s;ly di&s;turbed, for that he <HI>imagines</HI> he &s;ees a ruffian coming again&s;t him with a drawn &s;word, though at the &s;ame time he is <HI>con&s;cious</HI> it is a delu&s;ion, I pronounce him to have a di&s;ordered imagination; but if a man tells me that he <HI>&s;ees</HI> this, and in con&s;ternation calls to me to look at it, I pronounce him to be <HI>mad."</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is a common effect of low &s;pirits or melancholy, to make tho&s;e who are afflicted with it imagine that they are actually &s;uffering tho&s;e evils which happen to be mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rongly pre&s;ented to their minds. Some have fancied them&s;elves to be deprived of the u&s;e of their limbs, &s;ome to labour under acute di&s;ea&s;es, others to be in extreme poverty, when, in truth, there was not the lea&s;t reality in any of the &s;uppo&s;itions; &s;o that when the vapours were di&s;pelled, they were convinced of the delu&s;ion. To John&s;on, who&s;e &s;upreme enjoyment was the exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on, the di&s;turbance or ob&s;curation of that faculty was the evil mo&s;t to be dreaded. In&s;anity, therefore, was the object of his mo&s;t di&s;mal apprehen&s;ion; and he fancied him&s;elf &s;eized by it, or approaching to it, at the very time when he was giving proofs of a more than ordinary &s;oundne&s;s and vigour of judgement. That his own di&s;ea&s;ed imagination &s;hould have &s;o far deceived him, is &s;trange; but it is &s;tranger &s;till that &s;ome of his friends &s;hould have given credit to his groundle&s;s

opinion, when they had &s;uch undoubted proofs that it was totally fallacious; though it is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to depreciate him, &s;hould, &s;ince his death, have laid hold of this circum&s;tance, and in&s;i&s;ted upon it with very unfair aggravation.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;traction of a di&s;ea&s;e which very few have felt in its full extent, but many have experienced in a &s;lighter degree, John&s;on, in his writings, and in his conver&s;ation, never failed to di&s;play all the varieties of intellectual excellence. In his march through this world to a better, his mind &s;till appeared grand and brilliant, and impre&s;&s;ed all around him with the truth of Virgil's noble &s;entiment&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"Igneus e&s;t ollis vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">et caele&s;tis origo."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of his mind as to religion is an important article. I have mentioned the early impre&s;&s;ions made upon his tender imagination by his mother, who continued her pious care with a&s;&s;iduity, but, in his opinion, not with judgement. <Q REND="inline">"Sunday (&s;aid he) was a heavy day to me when I was a boy. My mother confined me on that day, and made me read 'The Whole Duty of Man,' from a great part of which I could derive no in&s;truc|tion. When, for in&s;tance, I had read the chapter on theft, which from my infancy I had been taught was wrong, I was no more convinced that theft was wrong than before; &s;o there was no acce&s;&s;ion of knowledge. A boy &s;hould be introduced to &s;uch books, by having his attention directed to the arrangement, to the &s;tile, and other excellencies of compo&s;ition; that the mind being thus engaged by an amu&s;ing variety of objects, may not grow weary."</Q></P>
<P>He communicated to me the following particulars upon the &s;ubject of his religious progre&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"I fell into an inattention to religion, or an indifference about it, in my ninth year. The church at Lichfield, in which we had a &s;eat, wanted reparation, &s;o I was to go and find a &s;eat in other churches; and having bad eyes, and being aukward about this, I to go and read in the fields on Sunday. This habit continued till my fourteenth year; and &s;till I find a great reluctance to go to church. I then became a &s;ort of lax <HI>talker</HI> again&s;t religion, for I did not much <HI>think</HI> again&s;t it; and this la&s;ted till I went to Oxford, where it would not be <HI>&s;uffered.</HI> When at Oxford, I took up 'Law's Serious Call to the Unconverted,' expecting to find it a dull book, (as &s;uch books generally are,) and perhaps to laugh at it. But I found Law quite an overmatch for me; and this was the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of my thinking in earne&s;t of religion, after I became capable of rational inquiry <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>Mrs. Piozzi has given a &s;trange fanta&s;tical account of the origin of Dr. John&s;on's belief in our mo&s;t holy religion. <Q REND="inline">"At the age of <HI>ten</HI> years his mind was di&s;turbed by &s;cruples of infidelity, which preyed upon his &s;pirits, and made him very unea&s;y, the more &s;o, as he revealed his unea&s;ine&s;s to none, being naturally (as he &s;aid) of a &s;ullen temper, and re&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition. He &s;earched, however, dili|gently, but fruitle&s;sly, for evidences of the truth of revelation&punc; and, at length, <HI>recollecting</HI> a book he had <HI>once</HI> &s;een <HI>[I &s;uppo&s;e at five years old]</HI> in his father's &s;hop, intitled <HI>De veritate Religionis,</HI> &amp;c. he began to think him&s;elf <HI>highly culpable</HI> for neglecting &s;uch a means of information, and took him|&s;elf &s;everely to ta&s;k for this <HI>&s;in,</HI> adding many acts of voluntary, and, to others, unknown <HI>pennance.</HI> The fir&s;t opportunity which offered, of cour&s;e, he &s;eized the book with avidity; but, on exami|nation, <HI>not finding him&s;elf &s;cholar enough to peru&s;e its contents,</HI> &s;et his heart at re&s;t; and not thinking to enquire whether there were any Engli&s;h books written on the &s;ubject, followed his u&s;ual amu&s;e|ments, and <HI>con&s;idered his con&s;cience as lightened of a crime.</HI> He redoubled his diligence to learn the language that contained the information he mo&s;t wi&s;hed for; but from the pain which <HI>guilt [namely, having omitted to read what he did not under&s;tand]</HI> had given him, he now began to deduce the &s;oul's immortality, <HI>[a &s;en&s;ation of pain in this world being an unque&s;tionable proof of exi&s;tence in another]</HI> which was the point that belief fir&s;t &s;topped at; <HI>and from that moment re&s;olving to be a Chri&s;tian,</HI> became one of the mo&s;t zealous and pious ones our nation ever produced."</Q> Anec|dotes, p. 17.</P>
<P>This is one of the numerous mi&s;repre&s;entations of this lively lady, which it is worth while to correct; for if credit &s;hould be given to &s;uch a childi&s;h, irrational, and ridiculous &s;tatement of the foundation of Dr. John&s;on's faith in Chri&s;tianity, how little credit would be due to it. Mrs. Piozzi &s;eems to wi&s;h, that the world &s;hould think Dr. John&s;on al&s;o under the influence of that ea&s;y logick, <HI>Stet pro ratione voluntas.</HI></P></NOTE>."</Q> From this time
<PB N="30" REF="59" MS="y"> forward, religion was the predominant object of his thoughts; though, with the ju&s;t &s;entiments of a con&s;cientious chri&s;tian, he lamented that his practice of its duties fell far &s;hort of what it ought to be.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance of a mind &s;uch as that of John&s;on being fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed, by an unexpected incident, to think with anxiety of the momentous concerns of eternity, and of <Q REND="inline">"what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved,"</Q> may for ever be produced in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperficial and &s;ometimes profane contempt that has been thrown upon tho&s;e occa&s;ional impre&s;&s;ions which it is certain many chri&s;tians have experienced; though it mu&s;t be acknowledged that weak minds, from an erroneous &s;uppo&s;ition that no man is in a &s;tate of grace who has not felt a particular conver&s;ion, have, in &s;ome ca&s;es, brought a degree of ridicule upon them; a ridicule, of which it is incon&s;iderate or unfair to make a general application.</P>
<P>How &s;eriou&s;ly John&s;on was impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religion, even in the vigour of his youth, appears from the following pa&s;&s;age in his minutes kept by way of diary: <Q REND="inline">"Sept. 7, 1736. I have this day entered upon my 28th year. Maye&s;t thou, O GOD, enable me, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake, to &s;pend this in &s;uch a manner, that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death, and in the day of judgement! Amen."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="60">
The particular cour&s;e of his reading while at Oxford, and during the time of vacation which he pa&s;&s;ed at home, cannot be traced. Enough has been &s;aid of his irregular mode of &s;tudy. He told me, that from his earlie&s;t years he loved to read poetry, but hardly ever read any poem to an end; that he read Shak&s;peare at a period &s;o early, that the &s;peech of the Gho&s;t in Hamlet terrified him when he was alone; that Horace's Odes were the com|po&s;itions in which he took mo&s;t delight, and it was long before he liked his Epi&s;tles and Satires. He told me what he read <HI>&s;olidly</HI> at Oxford was Greek; not the Grecian hi&s;torians, but Homer and Euripides, and now and then a little Epigram; that the &s;tudy of which he was mo&s;t fond was Metaphy&s;icks, but he had not read much, even in that way. I always thought that he did him&s;elf inju&s;tice in his account of what he had read, and that he mu&s;t have been &s;peaking with reference to the va&s;t portion of &s;tudy which is po&s;&s;ible, and to which a few &s;cholars in the whole hi&s;tory of literature have attained; for when I once a&s;ked him whether a per&s;on who&s;e name I have now for|gotten, &s;tudied hard, he an&s;wered <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. I do not believe he &s;tudied hard. I never knew a man who &s;tudied hard. I conclude, indeed, from the effects, that &s;ome men have &s;tudied hard, as Bentley and Clarke."</Q> Trying him by that criterion upon which he formed his judgement of others, we may be ab&s;olutely certain, both from his writings and his conver&s;ation, that his read|ing was very exten&s;ive. Dr. Adam Smith, than whom few are better judges on this &s;ubject, once ob&s;erved to me that <Q REND="inline">"John&s;on knew more books than any man alive."</Q> He had a peculiar facility in &s;eizing at once what was valuable in any book, without &s;ubmitting to the labour of peru&s;ing it from beginning to end. He had, from the irritability of his con&s;titution, at all times, an impatience and hurry when he either read or wrote. A certain apprehen&s;ion, ari&s;ing from novelty, made him write his fir&s;t exerci&s;e at College twice over; but he never took that trouble with any other compo|&s;ition; and we &s;hall &s;ee that his mo&s;t excellent works were &s;truck off at a heat, with rapid exertion.</P>
<P>Yet he appears, from his early notes or memorandums, in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to have at various times attempted, or at lea&s;t planned, a methodical cour&s;e of &s;tudy, according to computation, of which he was all his life fond, as it fixed his attention &s;teadily upon &s;omething without, and prevented his mind from preying upon it&s;elf. Thus I find in his hand-writing the number of lines in each of two of Euripides's Tragedies, of the Georgicks of Virgil, of the fir&s;t &s;ix books of the Aeneid, of Horace's Art of Poetry, of three of the books of Ovid's Metamorpho&s;is, of &s;ome parts of Theocritus, and of the tenth
<PB N="32" REF="61"> Satire of Juvenal; and a table, &s;hewing at the rate of various numbers day, (I &s;uppo&s;e ver&s;es to be read) what would be, in each ca&s;e, the tota amount in a week, month, and year.</P>
<P>No man had a more ardent love of literature, or a higher re&s;pect for it than John&s;on. His apartment in Pembroke College was that upon the &s;econd floor, over the gateway. The enthu&s;ia&s;ts of learning will ever contemplate it with veneration. One day, while he was &s;itting in it quite alone, Dr. Panting then ma&s;ter of the College, whom he called <Q REND="inline">"a fine Jacobite fellow,"</Q> over|heard him uttering this &s;oliloquy in his &s;trong emphatick voice: <Q REND="inline">"Well, I have a mind to &s;ee what is done in other places of learning. I'll go and vi&s;it the Univer&s;ities abroad. I'll go to France and Italy. I'll go to Padua.&mdash;And I'll mind my bu&s;ine&s;s. For an <HI>Athenian</HI> blockhead is the wor&s;t of all blockheads <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">I had this anecdote from Dr. Adams, and Dr. John&s;on confirmed it.

<Q><L>"Sure, of all blockheads, &s;cholars are the wor&s;t."</L></Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Adams told me, that John&s;on, while he was at Pembroke College, <Q REND="inline">"was care&s;&s;ed and loved by all about him, was a gay and frolick&s;ome fellow, and pa&s;&s;ed there the happie&s;t part of his life."</Q> But this is a &s;triking proof of the fallacy of appearances, and how little any of us know of the real internal &s;tate even of tho&s;e whom we &s;ee mo&s;t frequently; for the truth is, that he was then depre&s;&s;ed by poverty, and irritated by di&s;ea&s;e. When I mentioned to him this account as given me by Dr. Adams, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, Sir, I was mad and violent. It was bitterne&s;s which they mi&s;took for frolick. I was mi&s;erably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my wit; &s;o I di&s;regarded all power and all authority."</Q></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of Dromore ob&s;erves in a letter to me, <Q REND="inline">"The plea&s;ure he took in vexing the tutors and fellows has been often mentioned. But I have heard him &s;ay, what ought to be recorded to the honour of the pre&s;ent vene|rable ma&s;ter of that College, the Reverend William Adams, D. D. who was then very young, and one of the junior fellows; that the mild but judicious expo&s;tulations of this worthy man, who&s;e virtue awed him, and who&s;e learn|ing he revered, made him really a&s;hamed of him&s;elf, 'though I fear (&s;aid he) I was too proud to own it.'</Q></P>

<P>He very early began to attempt keeping notes or memorandums, by way of a diary of his life.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1730">
<P>I do not find that he formed any clo&s;e intimacies with his fellow-collegians. But Dr. Adams told me, that he contracted a love and regard for Pem|broke College, which he retained to the la&s;t. A &s;hort time before his death he &s;ent to that College a pre&s;ent of all his works, to be depo&s;ited in their library, and he had thoughts of leaving to it his hou&s;e at Lichfield; but his friends who were about him very properly di&s;&s;uaded him from it, and he be|queathed it to &s;ome poor relations. He took a plea&s;ure in boa&s;ting of the many eminent men who had been educated at Pembroke.

Being him&s;elf a poet, John&s;on was peculiarly happy in mentioning how many of the &s;ons of Pembroke were poets; adding, with a &s;mile of &s;portive triumph, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we are a ne&s;t of &s;inging birds."</Q></P>
<P>He was not, however, blind to what he thought the defects of his own College; and I have, from the information of Dr. Taylor, a very &s;trong in&s;tance of that rigid hone&s;ty which he ever inflexibly pre&s;erved. Taylor had obtained his father's con&s;ent to be entered of Pembroke, that he might be with his &s;choolfellow John&s;on, with whom, though &s;ome years older than him&s;elf, he was very intimate. This would have been a great comfort to John&s;on. But he fairly told Taylor that he could not, in con&s;cience, &s;uffer him to enter where he knew he could not have an able tutor. He then made inquiry all round the Univer&s;ity, and having found that Mr. Bateman, of
<PB N="34" REF="63" MS="y">
 Chri&s;t-Church, was the tutor of highe&s;t reputation, Taylor was entered of that College. Mr. Bateman's lectures were &s;o excellent, that John&s;on u&s;ed to come and get-them at &s;econd-hand from Taylor, till his poverty being &s;o extreme, that his &s;hoes were worn out, and his feet appeared through them, he &s;aw that this humiliating circum&s;tance was perceived by the Chri&s;t-church|men, and he came no more. He was too proud to accept of money, and &s;omebody having &s;et a pair of new &s;hoes at his door, he threw them away with indignation. How mu&s;t we feel when we read &s;uch an anecdote of Samuel John&s;on!</P>
<P>His &s;pirited refu&s;al of an eleemo&s;ynary &s;upply of &s;hoes, aro&s;e, no doubt, from a proper pride. But, con&s;idering his a&s;cetick di&s;po&s;ition at times, as acknowledged by him&s;elf in his Meditations, and the exaggeration with which &s;ome have treated the peculiarities of his character, I &s;hould not wonder to hear it a&s;cribed to a principle of &s;uper&s;titious mortification; as we are told by Tur&s;ellinus, in his Life of St. Ignatius Loyola, that this intrepid founder of the order of Je&s;uits, when he arrived at Goa, after having made a &s;evere pilgrimage through the ea&s;tern de&s;erts, per&s;i&s;ted in wearing his mi&s;erable &s;hattered &s;hoes, and when new ones were offered him, rejected them as an un&s;uitable indulgence.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1731">
<P><MILESTONE N="1731. Aetat. 22."> The <HI>res angu&s;ta domi</HI> prevented him from having the advantage of a com|plete academical education. The friend to whom he had tru&s;ted for &s;upport had deceived him. His debts in College, though not great, were increa&s;ing; and his &s;canty remittances from Lichfield, which had all along been made with great difficulty, could be &s;upplied no longer, his father having fallen into a &s;tate of in&s;olvency. Compelled, therefore, by irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity, he left the College in autumn, 1731, without a degree, having been a member of it little more than three years.</P>
<P>Dr. Adams, the worthy and re&s;pectable ma&s;ter of Pembroke College, has generally had the reputation of being John&s;on's tutor. The fact, however, is, that in 1731 Mr. Jorden quitted the College, and his pupils were tran&s;|ferred to Dr. Adams; &s;o that had John&s;on returned, Dr. Adams <HI>would have been his tutor.</HI> It is to be wi&s;hed, that this connection had taken place. His equal temper, mild di&s;po&s;ition, and politene&s;s of manners, might have in&s;en|&s;ibly &s;oftened the har&s;hne&s;s of John&s;on, and infu&s;ed into him tho&s;e more delicate charities, that <HI>petite morale,</HI> in which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, our great morali&s;t was more deficient than his be&s;t friends could fully ju&s;tify. Dr. Adams paid John&s;on this high compliment. He &s;aid to me at Oxford, in 1776, <Q REND="inline">"I was his nominal tutor, but he was above my mark."</Q> When I
<PB N="35" REF="64" MS="y">
repeated it to John&s;on, his eyes fla&s;hed with grateful &s;atisfaction, and he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"That was liberal and noble."</Q></P>
<P>And now (I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>poor)</HI> Samuel John&s;on returned to his native city, de&s;titute, and not knowing how he &s;hould gain even a decent livelihood. His father's misfortunes in trade rendered him unable to &s;upport his &s;on; and for &s;ome time there appeared no means by which he could maintain him&s;elf. In the December of this year his father died.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of poverty in which he died, appears from a note in one of John&s;on's little diaries of the following year, which &s;trongly di&s;plays his &s;pirit and virtuous dignity of mind. <Q REND="inline">"1732, <HI>Julii</HI> 15. <HI>Undecim aureos depo&s;ui, quo die quicquid ante matris funus (quod &s;erum &s;it precor) de paternis bonis &s;perari licet, viginti &s;cilicet libras accepi.

I now, therefore, &s;ee that I mu&s;t make my own fortune. Meanwhile, let me take care that the powers of my mind may not be debilitated by poverty, and that indigence do not force me into any criminal act."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was &s;o far fortunate, that the re&s;pectable character of his parents, and his own merit, had, from his earlie&s;t years, &s;ecured him a kind reception in the be&s;t families at Lichfield. Among the&s;e I can mention Mr. Howard, Dr. Swinfen, Mr. Simp&s;on, Mr. Levett, Captain Garrick, father of the great ornament of the Briti&s;h &s;tage; but above all, Mr. Gilbert Walm&s;ley <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Mr. Warton informs me, <Q REND="inline">"that this early friend of John&s;on was entered a Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, aged 17, in 1698; and is the authour of many Latin ver&s;e tran&s;la|tions in the Gentleman's Magazine.</Q> One of them is a tran&s;lation of
<Q><L>"My time, O ye Mu&s;es, was happily &s;pent, &amp;c."</L></Q></NOTE>, Regi&s;ter of the Prerogative Court of Lichfield, who&s;e character, long after his decea&s;e, Dr. John&s;on has, in his life of Edmund Smith, thus drawn in the glowing colours of gratitude:</P>
<Q><P>Of Gilbert Walm&s;ley, thus pre&s;ented to my mind, let me indulge my&s;elf in the remembrance. I knew him very early; he was one of the fir&s;t friends that literature procured me, and I hope that, at lea&s;t, my gratitude made me worthy of his notice.</P>
<P>He was of an advanced age, and I was only not a boy; yet he never received my notions with contempt. He was a whig, with all the virulence
<PB N="36" REF="65" MS="y">
 and malevolence of his party; yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart. I honoured him, and he endured me.</P>
<P>He had mingled with the gay world without exemption from its vices or its follies; but had never neglected the cultivation of his mind. His belief of revelation was un&s;haken; his learning pre&s;erved his principles; he grew fir&s;t regular, and then pious.</P>
<P>His &s;tudies had been &s;o various, that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge. His acquaintance with books was great, and what he did not immediately know, he could, at lea&s;t, tell where to find. Such was his amplitude of learning, and &s;uch his copiou&s;ne&s;s of communication, that it may be doubted whether a day now pa&s;&s;es, in which I have not &s;ome advan|tage from his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>At this man's table I enjoyed many cheerful and in&s;tructive hours, with companions, &s;uch as are not often found&mdash;with one who has lengthened, and one who has gladdened life; with Dr. James, who&s;e &s;kill in phy&s;ick will be long remembered; and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend. But what are the hopes of man! I am di&s;appointed by that &s;troke of death, which has eclip&s;ed the gaiety of nations, and impoveri&s;hed the publick &s;tock of harmle&s;s plea&s;ure.</P></Q>
<P>In the&s;e families he pa&s;&s;ed much time in his early years. In mo&s;t of them, he was in the company of ladies, particularly at Mr. Walm&s;ley's, who&s;e wife and &s;i&s;ters-in-law, of the name of A&s;ton, and daughters of a baronet, were remarkable for good breeding; &s;o that the notion which has been indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated and believed, that he never was in good company till late in life, and, con&s;equently, had been confirmed in coar&s;e and ferocious manners by long habits, is wholly without foundation. Some of the ladies have a&s;&s;ured me, they recollected him well when a young man, as di&s;tingui&s;hed for his complai&s;ance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1732">
<P>And that this politene&s;s was not merely occa&s;ional and temporary, or con|fined to the circles of Lichfield, is a&s;certained by the te&s;timony of a lady, who, in a paper with which I have been favoured by a daughter of his intimate friend and phy&s;ician, Dr. Lawrence, thus de&s;cribes Dr. John&s;on &s;ome years afterwards:</P>
<Q><P>As the particulars of the former part of Dr. John&s;on's life do not &s;eem to be very accurately known, a lady hopes that the following information may not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>She remembers Dr. John&s;on on a vi&s;it to Dr. Taylor, at A&s;hbourn, &s;ome time between the end of the year 37, and the middle of the year 40; &s;he
<PB N="37" REF="66" MS="y">
rather thinks it to have been after he and his wife were removed to London. <MILESTONE N="1732. Aetat. 23."> During his &s;tay at A&s;hbourn, he made frequent vi&s;its to Mr. Meynell, at Brodley, where his company was much de&s;ired by the ladies of the family, who were, perhaps, in point of elegance and accompli&s;hments, inferiour to few of tho&s;e with whom he was afterwards acquainted. Mr. Meynell's elde&s;t daughter was afterwards married to Mr. Fitzherbert, father to Mr. Alleyne Fitzherbert, lately mini&s;ter to the court of Ru&s;&s;ia. Of her, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, in Dr. Lawrence's &s;tudy, that &s;he had the be&s;t under&s;tanding he ever met with in any human being. At Mr. Meynell's he al&s;o commenced that friend&s;hip with Mrs. Hill Boothby, &s;i&s;ter to the pre&s;ent Sir Brook Boothby, which con|tinued till her death. The <HI>young woman whom he u&s;ed to call Molly A&s;ton</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">The words of Sir John Hawkins, p. 316.</NOTE>, was &s;i&s;ter to Sir Thomas A&s;ton, and daughter to a Baronet; &s;he was likewi&s;e &s;i&s;ter to the wife of his friend Mr. Gilbert Walm&s;ley. Be&s;ides his inti|macy with the above-mentioned per&s;ons, who were &s;urely people of rank and education, while he was yet at Lichfield he u&s;ed to be frequently at the hou&s;e of Dr. Swinfen, a gentleman of a very ancient family in Stafford|&s;hire, from which, after the death of his elder brother, he inherited a good e&s;tate. He was, be&s;ides, a phy&s;ician of very exten&s;ive practice; but for want of due attention to the management of his dome&s;tic concerns, left a very large family in indigence. One of his daughters, Mrs. De&s;moulins, afterwards found an a&s;ylum in the hou&s;e of her old friend, who&s;e doors were always open to the unfortunate, and who well ob&s;erved the precept of the go&s;pel, for he was kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</P></Q>
<P>In the &s;orlorn &s;tate of his circum&s;tances he accepted of an offer to be employed as u&s;her in the &s;chool of Market-Bo&s;worth, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to which it appears, from one of his little fragments of a diary, that he went on foot, on the 16th of July,&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"Julii</HI> 16. <HI>Bo&s;vortiam pedes petii."</HI></Q> But it is not true, as has been erroneou&s;ly related, that he was a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the famous Anthony Blackwall, who&s;e merit has been honoured by the te&s;timony of Bi&s;hop Hurd, who was his &s;cholar; for Mr. Blackwall died on the 8th of April, 1730 <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">See Gent. Mag. Dec. 1784, p. 957.</NOTE>, more than a year before John&s;on left the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>This employment was very irk&s;ome to him in every re&s;pect, and he com|plained grievou&s;ly of it in his letters to his friend Mr. Hector, who was now &s;ettled as a &s;urgeon at Birmingham. The letters are lo&s;t; but Mr. Hector recollects his writing <Q REND="inline">"that the poet had de&s;cribed the dull &s;amene&s;s of his exi&s;tence in the&s;e words, <HI>'Vitam continet una dies'</HI> (one day contains the whole
<PB N="38" REF="67" MS="y">
<MILESTONE N="1733. Aetat. 24."> of my life); that it was unvaried as the note of the cuckow; and that he did not know whether it was more di&s;agreeable for him to teach, or the boys to learn, the grammar rules."</Q> His general aver&s;ion to this painful drudgery was greatly enhanced by a di&s;agreement between him and Sir Wool&s;ton Dixey, the patron of the &s;chool, in who&s;e hou&s;e, I have been told, he officiated as a kind of dome&s;tick chaplain, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as to &s;ay grace at table, but was treated with what he repre&s;ented as intolerable har&s;hne&s;s; and, after &s;uffering for a few months &s;uch complicated mi&s;ery, he relinqui&s;hed a &s;ituation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion, and even a degree of horrour. But it is probable that at this period, whatever unea&s;i|ne&s;s he may have endured, he laid the foundation of much future eminence by application to his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Being now again totally unoccupied, he was invited by Mr. Hector to pa&s;s &s;ome time with him at Birmingham, as his gue&s;t, at the hou&s;e of Mr. Warren, with whom Mr. Hector lodged and boarded. Mr. Warren was the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed book&s;eller in Birmingham, and was very attentive to John&s;on, who he &s;oon found could be of much &s;ervice to him in his trade, by his knowledge of literature; and he even obtained the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his pen in furni&s;hing &s;ome numbers of a periodical E&s;&s;ay printed in the new&s;paper, of which Warren was proprietor. After very diligent inquiry, I have not been able to recover tho&s;e early &s;pecimens of that particular mode of writing by which John&s;on afterwards &s;o greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He continued to live as Mr. Hector's gue&s;t for about &s;ix months, and then hired lodgings in another part of the town, finding him&s;elf as well &s;ituated at Birmingham as he &s;uppo&s;ed he could be any where, while he had no &s;ettled plan of life, and very &s;canty means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He made &s;ome valuable acquaintances there, among&s;t whom were Mr. Porter, a mercer, who&s;e widow he afterwards married, and Mr. Taylor, who by his ingenuity in mechanical inventions, and his &s;ucce&s;s in trade, acquired an immen&s;e fortune. But the comfort of being near Mr. Hector, his old &s;choolfellow and intimate friend, was John&s;on's chief inducement to continue here.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1733">
<P>In what manner he employed his pen at this period, or whether he derived from it any pecuniary advantage, I have not been able to a&s;certain. He probably got a little money from Mr. Warren; and we are certain, that he executed here one piece of literary labour, of which Mr. Hector has favoured me with a minute account. Having mentioned that he had read at Pembroke College a Voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia, by Lobo, a Portugue&s;e je&s;uit, and that he thought an abridgement and tran&s;lation of it from the French into Engli&s;h
<PB N="39" REF="68" MS="y">
might be an u&s;eful and profitable publication, Mr. Warren and Mr. Hector joined in urging him to undertake it. He accordingly agreed; and the book not being to be found in Birmingham, he borrowed it of Pembroke College. A part of the work being very &s;oon done, one O&s;born, who was Mr. Warren's printer, was &s;et to work with what was ready, and John&s;on engaged to &s;upply the pre&s;s with copy as it &s;hould be wanted; but his con|&s;titutional indolence &s;oon prevailed, and the work was at a &s;tand. Mr. Hector, who knew that a motive of humanity would be the mo&s;t prevailing argument with his friend, went to John&s;on, and repre&s;ented to him, that the printer could have no other employment till this undertaking was fini&s;hed, and that the poor man and his family were &s;uffering. John&s;on upon this exerted the powers of his mind, though his body was relaxed. He lay in bed with the book, which was a quarto, before him, and dictated while Hector wrote. Mr. Hector carried the &s;heets to the pre&s;s&punc; and corrected almo&s;t all the proof &s;heets, very few of which were even &s;een by John&s;on. In this manner, with the aid of Mr. Hector's active friend&s;hip, the book was completed, and was publi&s;hed in 1735, with LONDON upon the title-page, though it was in reality printed at Birmingham, a device too common with provincial publi&s;hers. For this work he had from Mr. Warren only the &s;um of five guineas.</P>
<P>This being the fir&s;t pro&s;e work of John&s;on, it is a curious object of inquiry how much may be traced in it of that &s;tyle which marks his &s;ub|&s;equent writings with &s;uch peculiar excellence; with &s;o happy an union of force, vivacity, and per&s;picuity. I have peru&s;ed the book with this view, and have found that here, as I believe in every other tran&s;lation, there is in the work it&s;elf no ve&s;tige of the tran&s;lator's own &s;tyle; for the language of tran&s;|lation being adapted to the thoughts of another per&s;on, in&s;en&s;ibly follows their ca&s;t, and, as it were, runs into a mould that is ready prepared.</P>
<P>Thus, for in&s;tance, taking the fir&s;t &s;entence that occurs at the opening of the book, p. 4. <Q REND="inline">"I lived here above a year, and completed my &s;tudies in divinity; in which time &s;ome letters were received from the fathers in Ethiopia, with an account that Sultan Segned, Emperour of Aby&s;&s;inia, was converted to the church of Rome; that many of his &s;ubjects had followed his example, and that there was a great want of mi&s;&s;ionaries to improve the&s;e pro&s;perous beginnings. Every body was very de&s;irous of &s;econding the zeal of our fathers, and of &s;ending them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they reque&s;ted; to which we were the more encouraged, becau&s;e the Emperour's letter informed our Provincial, that we might ea&s;ily enter his dominions by the way of Dancala;
<PB N="40" REF="69" MS="y"> but&punc; unhappily, the &s;ecretary wrote Geila for Dancala, which co&s;t two of our fathers their lives."</Q> Every one acquainted with John&s;on's manner will be &s;en&s;ible that there is nothing of it here, but that this &s;entence might have been compo&s;ed by any other man.</P>
<P>But, in the Preface, the John&s;onian &s;tyle begins to appear; and though u&s;e had not yet taught his wing a permanent and equable flight, there are parts of it which exhibit his be&s;t manner in full vigour. I had once the plea&s;ure of examining it with Mr. Edmund Burke, who confirmed me in this opinion, by his &s;uperious critical &s;agacity, and was, I remember, much delighted with the following &s;pecimen:</P>
<Q><P>The Portugue&s;e traveller, contrary to the general vein of his country|men, has amu&s;ed his reader with no romantick ab&s;urdity, or incredible fictions; whatever he relates, whether true or not, is at lea&s;t probable; and he who tells nothing exceeding the bounds of probability, has a right to demand that they &s;hould believe him who cannot contradict him.</P>
<P>He appears, by his mode&s;t and unaffected narration, to have de&s;cribed things as he &s;aw them, to have copied nature from-the life, and to have con&s;ulted his &s;en&s;es, not his imagination. He meets with no ba&s;ili&s;ks that de&s;troy with their eyes, his crocodiles devour their prey without tears, and his cataracts fall from the rocks without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants.</P>
<P>The reader will here find no regions cur&s;ed with irremediable barrenne&s;s, or ble&s;&s;ed with &s;pontaneous fecundity; no perpetual gloom, or uncea&s;ing &s;un|&s;hine; nor are the nations here de&s;cribed either devoid of all &s;en&s;e of huma|nity, or con&s;ummate in all private or &s;ocial virtues. Here are no Hottentots without religious polity or articulate language; no Chine&s;e perfectly polite, and completely &s;killed in all &s;ciences; he will di&s;cover, what will always be di&s;covered by a diligent and impartial enquirer, that wherever human nature is to be found, there is a mixture of vice and virtue, a conte&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion and rea&s;on; and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his di&s;tributions, but has balanced, in mo&s;t countries, their particular inconveniencies by par|ticular favours.</P></Q>
<P>Here we have an early example of that brilliant and energetick expre&s;&s;ion, which, upon innumerable occa&s;ions in his &s;ub&s;equent life, ju&s;tly impre&s;&s;ed the world with the highe&s;t admiration.</P>
<P>Nor can any one, conver&s;ant with the writings of John&s;on, fail to di&s;cern his hand in this pa&s;&s;age of the Dedication to John Warren, E&s;q. of Pem|broke&s;hire, though it is a&s;cribed to Warren the book&s;eller. <Q REND="inline">"A generous and elevated mind is di&s;tingui&s;hed by nothing more certainly than an eminent

degree of curio&s;ity; nor is that curio&s;ity ever more agreeably or u&s;efully em|ployed, <MILESTONE N="1734. Aetat. 25."> than in examining the laws and cu&s;toms of foreign nations. I hope, therefore, the pre&s;ent I now pre&s;ume to make, will not be thought improper; which, however, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s as a dedicator to commend, nor as a book&s;eller to depreciate."</Q></P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that his having been thus accidentally led to a particular &s;tudy of the hi&s;tory and manners of Aby&s;&s;inia, was the remote occa&s;ion of his writing, many years afterwards, his admirable philo&s;ophical tale, the principal &s;cene of which is laid in that country.</P>

<P>AS you appear no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than your readers of the defects of your poetical article, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, if, in order to the improve|ment of it, I communicate to you the &s;entiments of a per&s;on, who will undertake, on rea&s;onable terms, &s;ometimes to fill a column.</P>

 His opinion is, that the publick would not give you a bad reception, if, be&s;ide the current wit of the month, which a critical examination would generally reduce to a narrow compa&s;s, you admitted not only poems, in&s;crip|tions, &amp;c. never printed before, which he will &s;ometimes &s;upply you with; but likewi&s;e &s;hort literary di&s;&s;ertations in Latin or Engli&s;h, critical remarks on authours ancient or modern, forgotten poems that de&s;erve revival, or loo&s;e pieces, like Floyer's, worth pre&s;erving. By this method your literary article, for &s;o it might be called, will, he thinks, be better recommended to the publick, than by low je&s;ts, aukward buffoonery, or the dull &s;currilities of either party.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a corre&s;pondence will be agreeable to you, be plea&s;ed to inform me in two po&s;ts, what the conditions are on which you &s;hall expect it.

<P>Mr. Cave has put a note on this letter, <Q REND="inline">"An&s;wered Dec. 2."</Q> But whether any thing was done in con&s;equence of it we are not informed.</P>
<P>John&s;on had, from his early youth, been &s;en&s;ible to the influence of female charms. When at Stourbridge &s;chool, he was much enamoured of Olivia Lloyd, a young quaker, to whom he wrote a copy of ver&s;es, which I have not been able to recover; and I am a&s;&s;ured by Mi&s;s Seward, that he con|ceived a tender pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Lucy Porter, daughter of the lady whom he afterwards married. Mi&s;s Porter was &s;ent very young on a vi&s;it to Lichfield, where John&s;on had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing and admiring her; and he addre&s;&s;ed to her the following ver&s;es, on her pre&s;enting him with a no&s;e|gay of myrtle:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"What hopes, what terrors does thy gift create,</L>
<L>"Ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate:</L>
<L>"The myrtle, en&s;ign of &s;upreme command,</L>
<L>"Con&s;ign'd by Venus to Meli&s;&s;a's hand;</L>
<L>"Not le&s;s capricious than a reigning fair,</L>
<L>"Now grants, and now rejects a lover's prayer.</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="72" MS="y">
"In myrtle &s;hades oft &s;ings the happy &s;wain,</L>
<L>"In myrtle &s;hades de&s;pairing gho&s;ts complain;</L>
<L>"The myrtle crowns the happy lovers' heads,</L>
<L>"The unhappy lovers' grave the myrtle &s;preads:</L>
<L>"O then the meaning of thy gift impart,</L>
<L>"And ea&s;e the throbbings of an anxious heart!</L>
<L>"Soon mu&s;t this bough, as you &s;hall fix his doom,</L>
<L>"Adorn Philander's head, or grace his tomb <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi, in her <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> a&s;&s;erts that John&s;on wrote this effu&s;ion of elegant tender|ne&s;s not in his own per&s;on, but for a friend who was in love. But that lively lady is an inaccurate in this in&s;tance as in many others; for Mi&s;s Seward writes to me&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"I know</HI> tho&s;e ver&s;es were addre&s;&s;ed to Lucy Porter, when he was enamoured of her in his boyi&s;h days, two or three years before he had &s;een her mother, his future wife. He wrote them at my grandfather's, and gave them to Lucy in the pre&s;ence of my mother, to whom he &s;hewed them on the in&s;tant. She u&s;ed to repeat them to me, when I a&s;ked her for <HI>the ver&s;es Dr. John&s;on gave her on a &s;prig of myrtle, which he had &s;tolen or begged from her bo&s;om.</HI> We all know hone&s;t Lucy Porter to have been inca|pable of the mean vanity of applying to her&s;elf a compliment not <HI>intended</HI> for her."</Q></NOTE>.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>His juvenile attachments to the fair &s;ex were, however, very tran&s;ient; and it is certain, that he formed no criminal connection what&s;oever. Mr. Hector, who lived with him in his younger days in the utmo&s;t intimacy and &s;ocial freedom, has a&s;&s;ured me, that even at that ardent &s;ea&s;on his conduct was &s;trictly virtuous in that re&s;pect&punc; and that though he loved to exhilarate him|&s;elf with wine, he never knew him intoxicated but once.</P>
<P>In a man whom religious education has &s;ecured from licentious indul|gences, the pa&s;&s;ion of love, when once it has &s;eized him, is exceedingly &s;trong; being unimpaired by di&s;&s;ipation, and totally concentrated in one object. This was experienced by John&s;on&punc; when he became the &s;ervent admirer of Mrs. Porter, after her fir&s;t hu&s;band's death. Mi&s;s Porter told me, that when he was fir&s;t introduced to her mother, his appearance was very forbidding: He was then lean and lank, &s;o that his immen&s;e &s;tructure of bones was hideou&s;ly &s;triking to the eye, and the &s;cars of the &s;crophula were deeply vi&s;ible. He al&s;o wore his hair, which was &s;traight and &s;tiff, and &s;epa|rated behind; and he often had, &s;eemingly, convul&s;ive &s;tarts and odd ge&s;ticulations, which tended to excite at once &s;urpri&s;e and ridicule. Mrs. Porter was &s;o much engaged by his conver&s;ation that &s;he overlooked all the&s;e external di&s;advantages, and &s;aid to her daughter, <Q REND="inline">"this is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible man that I ever &s;aw in my life."</Q></P>
</DIV2>

<P><PB N="44" REF="73" MS="y">
<MILESTONE N="1735. Aetat. 26."> Though Mrs. Porter was double the age of John&s;on, and her per&s;on and manner, as de&s;cribed to me by the late Mr. Garrick, were by no means plea&s;ing to others, &s;he mu&s;t have had a &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding and talents, as &s;he certainly in&s;pired him with a more than ordinary pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;he having &s;ignified her willingne&s;s to accept of his hand, he went to Lichfield to a&s;k his mother's con&s;ent to the marriage, which he could not but be con|&s;cious was a very imprudent &s;cheme, both on account of their di&s;parity of years, and her want of fortune. But Mrs. John&s;on knew too well the ardour of her &s;on's temper, and was too tender a parent to oppo&s;e his inclinations.</P>
<P>I know not for what rea&s;on the marriage ceremony was not performed at Birmingham; but a re&s;olution was taken that it &s;hould be at Derby, for which place the bride and bridegroom &s;et out on hor&s;eback, I &s;uppo&s;e in very good humour. But though Mr. Topham Beauclerk u&s;ed archly to mention John&s;on's having told him, with much gravity, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it was a love-marriage upon both &s;ides,"</Q> I have had from my illu&s;trious friend the following curious<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th July.</NOTE> account of their journey to church upon the nuptial morn. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, &s;he had read the old romances, and had got into her head the fanta&s;tical notion that a woman of &s;pirit &s;hould u&s;e her lover like a dog. So, Sir, at fir&s;t &s;he told me that I rode too fa&s;t, and &s;he could not keep up with me; and, when I rode a little &s;lower, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me, and complained that I lagged behind. I was not to be made the &s;lave of caprice; and I re&s;olved to begin as I meant to end. I therefore pu&s;hed on bri&s;kly, till I was fairly out of her &s;ight. The road lay between two hedges, &s;o I was &s;ure &s;he could not mi&s;s it; and I con|trived that &s;he &s;hould &s;oon come up with me. When &s;he did, I ob&s;erved her to be in tears."</Q></P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be allowed, was a &s;ingular beginning of connubial felicity; but there is no doubt that John&s;on, though he thus &s;hewed a manly firmne&s;s, proved a mo&s;t affectionate and indulgent hu&s;band to the la&s;t moment of Mrs. John&s;on's life; and in his <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> we find very remark|able evidence that his regard and fondne&s;s for her never cea&s;ed, even after her death.</P>

<P>He now &s;et up a private academy, for which purpo&s;e he hired a large hou&s;e, well &s;ituated near his native city. In the Gentleman's Magazine for 1736, there is the following adverti&s;ement: <Q REND="inline">"At Edial, near Lichfield, in Stafford&s;hire, young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages, by SAMUEL JOHNSON."</Q> But the only pupils that were put under his care were the celebrated David Garrick and his brother George, and a
<PB N="45" REF="74" MS="y">
Mr. Offely, a young gentleman of good fortune, who died early. As yet, his name had nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the highe&s;t attention and re&s;pect of mankind. Had &s;uch an adverti&s;ement appeared after the publication of his LONDON, or his RAMBLER, or his DICTIONARY, how would it have bur&s;t upon the world! with what eagerne&s;s would the great and the wealthy have embraced an opportunity of putting their &s;ons under the learned tuition of SAMUEL JOHNSON. The truth, how|ever, is, that he was not &s;o well qualified for being a teacher of elements, and a conductor in learning by regular gradations, as men of inferiour powers of mind. His own acqui&s;itions had been made by fits and &s;tarts, by violent irruptions into the regions of knowledge; and it could not be expected that his impatience would be &s;ubdued, and his impetuo&s;ity re&s;trained, &s;o as to fit him for a quiet guide to novices. The art of communicating in&s;truction, of whatever kind, is much to be valued; and I have ever thought that tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to this employment, and do their duty with diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, are entitled to very high re&s;pect from the community, as John&s;on him&s;elf often maintained. Yet I am of opinion, that the greate&s;t abilities are not only not required for this office, but render a man le&s;s fit for it.</P>
<P>While we acknowledge the ju&s;tne&s;s of Thom&s;on's beautiful remark,
<Q><L>"Delightful ta&s;k! to rear the tender thought,</L>
<L>"And teach the young idea how to &s;hoot!"</L></Q>
we mu&s;t con&s;ider that this delight is perceptible only by <Q REND="inline">"a mind at ea&s;e,"</Q> a mind at once calm and clear; but that a mind gloomy and impetuous like that of John&s;on, cannot be fixed for any length of time in minute attention, and mu&s;t be &s;o frequently irritated by unavoidable &s;lowne&s;s and errour in the advances of &s;cholars, as to perform the duty with little plea&s;ure to the teacher, and no great advantage to the pupils. Good temper is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi|&s;ite in a preceptor. Horace paints the character as <HI>bland:</HI>
<Q><L>"&mdash;Ut pueris olim dant cru&s;tula <HI>blandi</HI></L>
<L>"Doctores, elementa velint ut di&s;cere prima."</L></Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was not more &s;atisfied with his &s;ituation as the ma&s;ter of an academy, than with that of the u&s;her of a &s;chool; we need not wonder, there|fore, that he did not keep his academy above a year and a half. From Mr. Garrick's account he did not appear to have been profoundly reverenced by his pupils. His oddities of manner, and uncouth ge&s;ticulations, could not but be the &s;ubject of merriment to them; and, in particular, the young rogues u&s;ed to li&s;ten at the door of his bed-chamber, and peep through the
<PB N="46" REF="75" MS="y"> key-hole, that they might turn into ridicule his tumultuous and aukward fondne&s;s for Mrs. John&s;on, whom he u&s;ed to name by the familiar appel|lation of <HI>Tetty</HI> or <HI>Tet&s;y,</HI> which, like <HI>Betty</HI> or <HI>Bet&s;y,</HI> is provincially u&s;ed as a contraction for <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> her chri&s;tian name, but which to us &s;eems ludicrous, when applied to a woman of her age and appearance. Mr. Garrick de&s;cribed her to me as very fat, with a bo&s;om of more than ordinary protuberance, with &s;welled cheeks, of a florid red, produced by thick painting, and increa&s;ed by the liberal u&s;e of cordials; flaring and fanta&s;tick in her dre&s;s, and affected both in her &s;peech and her general behaviour. I have &s;een Garrick exhibit her, by his exqui&s;ite talent for mimickry, &s;o as to excite the heartie&s;t bur&s;ts of laughter; but he, probably, as is the ca&s;e in all &s;uch repre|&s;entations, con&s;iderably aggravated the picture.</P>
<P>That John&s;on well knew the mo&s;t proper cour&s;e to be pur&s;ued in the in&s;truc|tion of youth, is authentically a&s;certained by the following paper in his own hand-writing, given about this period to a relation, and now in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Mr. John Nichols:

<P>While John&s;on kept his academy, there can be no doubt that he was in|&s;en&s;ibly furni&s;hing his mind with various knowledge; but I have not di&s;covered that he wrote any thing except a great part of his tragedy of IRENE. Mr. Peter Garrick; the elder brother of David, told me that he remembered John&s;on's borrowing the Turki&s;h Hi&s;tory of him, in order to form his play from it. When he had fini&s;hed &s;ome part of it, he read what he had done to Mr. Walm&s;ley, who objected to his having already brought his heroine into great di&s;tre&s;s, and a&s;ked him <Q REND="inline">"how can you po&s;&s;ibly contrive to plunge her into deeper calamity?"</Q> John&s;on, in &s;ly allu&s;ion to the &s;uppo&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ive pro|ceedings of the court of which Mr. Walm&s;ley was regi&s;ter, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I can put her into the Spiritual Court!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Walm&s;ley, however, was well plea&s;ed with this proof of John&s;on's abilities as a dramatick writer, and advi&s;ed him to fini&s;h the tragedy, and produce it on the &s;tage.</P>

<MILESTONE N="1737.

It is a memorable circum&s;tance that his pupil David Garrick went thither at the &s;ame time, with intention to complete his education, and follow the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, from which he was &s;oon diverted by his decided preference for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This joint expedition of tho&s;e two eminent men to the metropolis, was many years afterwards noticed in an allegorical poem on Shak&s;peare's Mulberry Tree, by Mr. Lovibond, the ingenious authour of <Q REND="inline">"The Tears of Old May-day."</Q></P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<P>I had the favour of yours, and am extremely obliged to you; but I cannot &s;ay I had a greater affection for you upon it than I had before, being long &s;ince &s;o much endeared to you, as well by an early friend&s;hip, as by your many excellent and valuable qualifications; and, had I a &s;on of my own, it would be my ambition, in&s;tead of &s;ending him to the Univer&s;ity, to di&s;po&s;e of him as this young gentleman is.</P>

Davy Garrick is to be with you early the next week, and Mr. John&s;on to try his fate with a tragedy, and to &s;ee to get him&s;elf employed in &s;ome tran&s;lation, either from the Latin or the French. John&s;on is a very good &s;cholar and poet, and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedy-writer.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>G. WALMSLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>How he employed him&s;elf upon upon his fir&s;t coming to London is not particularly known. I never heard that he found any protection or encourage|ment by the means of Mr. Col&s;on, to who&s;e academy David Garrick went. Mrs. Lucy Porter told me, that Mr. Walm&s;ley gave him a letter of intro|duction to Lintot his book&s;eller, and that John&s;on wrote &s;ome things for him; but I imagine this to be a mi&s;take, for I have di&s;covered no trace of it, and I am pretty &s;ure he told me, that Mr. Cave was the fir&s;t publi&s;her by whom his pen was engaged in London.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="78" MS="y">
He had a little money when he came to town, and he knew how he could live in the cheape&s;t manner. His fir&s;t lodgings were at the hou&s;e of Mr. Norris, a &s;taymaker, in Exeter-&s;treet, adjoining Catharine-&s;treet, in the Strand. <Q REND="inline">"I dined (&s;aid he) very well for eight-pence, with very good company, at the Pine Apple in New-&s;treet, ju&s;t by. Several of them had travelled. They expected to meet every day; but did not know one another's names. It u&s;ed to co&s;t the re&s;t a &s;hilling, for they drank wine; but I had a cut of meat for &s;ix-pence, and bread for a penny, and gave the waiter a penny; &s;o that I was quite well &s;erved, nay, better than the re&s;t, for they gave the waiter nothing."</Q></P>
<P>He at this time, I believe, ab&s;tained entirely from fermented liquors; a practice to which he rigidly conformed for many years together, at different periods of his life.</P>
<P>His OFELLUS in the <HI>Art of living in London,</HI> I have heard him relate, was an Iri&s;h painter, whom he knew at Birmingham, and who had practi&s;ed his own precepts of oeconomy for &s;everal years in the Briti&s;h capital. He a&s;&s;ured John&s;on, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, was then meditating to try his fortune in London, but was apprehen&s;ive of the expence, <Q REND="inline">"that thirty pounds a year was enough to enable a man to live there without being contemptible. He allowed ten pounds for clothes and linen. He &s;aid a man might live in a garret at eighteen-pence a week; few people would inquire where he lodged; and if they did, it was ea&s;y to &s;ay, 'Sir, I am to be found at &s;uch a place.' By &s;pending three-pence in a coffee-hou&s;e, he might be for &s;ome hours every day in very good com|pany; he might dine for &s;ix-pence, breakfa&s;t on bread and milk for a penny, and do without &s;upper. On <HI>clean-&s;hirt-day</HI> he went abroad, and paid vi&s;its."</Q> I have heard him more than once talk of this frugal friend, whom he recol|lected with e&s;teem and kindne&s;s, and did not like to have any one &s;mile at the recital. <Q REND="inline">"This man (&s;aid he, gravely,) was a very &s;en&s;ible man, who perfectly under&s;tood common affairs: a man of a great deal of knowledge of the world, fre&s;h from life, not &s;trained through books. He borrowed a hor&s;e and ten pounds at Birmingham. Finding him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;o much money, he &s;et off for We&s;t Che&s;ter, in order to get to Ireland. He returned the hor&s;e, and probably the ten pounds too, after he got home."</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;idering John&s;on's narrow circum&s;tances in the early part of his life, and particularly at the intere&s;ting aera of his launching into the ocean of London, it is not to be wondered at, that an actual in&s;tance, proved by expe|rience, of the po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying the intellectual luxury of &s;ocial life, upon a very &s;mall income, &s;hould deeply engage his attention, and be ever recol|lected
<PB N="50" REF="79" MS="y"> by him as a circum&s;tance of much importance. He amu&s;ed him&s;elf, I remember, by computing how much more expence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to live upon the &s;ame &s;cale with that which his friend de&s;cribed, when the value of money was dimini&s;hed by the progre&s;s of commerce. It may be e&s;timated that double the money might now with difficulty be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t this cold ob&s;curity, there was one brilliant circum&s;tance to cheer him; he was well acquainted with Mr. Henry Hervey, one of the branches of the noble family of that name, who had been quartered at Lichfield as an officer of the army, and had at this time a hou&s;e in London, where John&s;on was frequently entertained, and had an opportunity of meeting genteel company. Not very long before his death, he mentioned this, among other particulars of his life, which he was kindly communicating to me; and he de&s;cribed this early friend <Q REND="inline">"Harry Hervey,"</Q> thus: <Q REND="inline">"He was a vicious man, but very kind to me. If you call a dog HERVEY, I &s;hall love him."</Q></P>
<P>He told me he had now written only three acts of his IRENE, and that he retired for &s;ome time to lodgings at Greenwich, where he proceeded in it &s;omewhat farther, and u&s;ed to compo&s;e, walking in the Park; but did not &s;tay long enough at that place to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>At this period we find the following letter from him to Mr. Edward Cave, which, as a link in the chain of his literary hi&s;tory, it is proper to in&s;ert:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>CAVE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Greenwich, next door to the Golden Heart, Church-&s;treet, <DATE>July 12, 1737.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING ob&s;erved in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters, I have cho&s;en, being a &s;tranger in London, to communicate to you the following de&s;ign, which, I hope, if you join in it, will be of advantage to both of us.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent having been lately tran&s;lated into French, and publi&s;hed with large Notes by Dr. Le Courayer, the reputation of that book is &s;o much revived in England, that, it is pre&s;umed, a new tran&s;lation of it from the Italian, together with Le Courayer's Notes from the French, could not fail of a favourable reception.</P>
<P>If it be an&s;wered, that the Hi&s;tory is already in Engli&s;h, it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that there was the &s;ame objection again&s;t Le Courayer's undertaking, with this di&s;advantage, that the French had a ver&s;ion by one of their be&s;t tran&s;lators, whereas you cannot read three pages of the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory
<PB N="51" REF="80" MS="y">
without di&s;covering that the &s;tyle is capable of great improvements; but whether tho&s;e improvements are to be expected from this attempt, you mu&s;t judge from the &s;pecimen, which, if you approve the propo&s;al, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to your examination.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the merit of the ver&s;ions equal, we may hope that the addition of the Notes will turn the balance in our favour, con&s;idering the reputation of the Annotator.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to favour me with a &s;peedy an&s;wer, if you are not willing to engage in this &s;cheme; and appoint me a day to wait upon you, if you are. I am, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your humble &s;ervant, SAM. JOHNSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem from this letter, though &s;ub&s;cribed with his own name, that he had not yet been introduced to Mr. Cave. We &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee what was done in con&s;equence of the propo&s;al which it contains.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer he returned to Lichfield, where he had left Mrs. John&s;on, and there he at la&s;t fini&s;hed his tragedy, which was not executed with his rapidity of compo&s;ition upon other occa&s;ions, but was &s;lowly and painfully elaborated. A few days before his death, while burning a great ma&s;s of papers, he picked out from among them the original unformed &s;ketch of this tragedy, in his own hand-writing, and gave it to Mr. Langton, by who&s;e favour a copy of it is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It contains fragments of the intended plot, and &s;peeches for the different per&s;ons of the drama, partly in the raw materials of pro&s;e, partly worked up into ver&s;e; as al&s;o a variety of hints for illu&s;tration borrowed from the Greek, Roman, and modern writers. The hand-writing is very difficult to be read, even by tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with John&s;on's mode of penman&s;hip, which at all times was very particular. The King having graciou&s;ly accepted of this manu&s;cript as a literary curio&s;ity, Mr. Langton made a fair and di&s;tinct copy of it, which he ordered to be bound up with the original and the printed tragedy; and the volume is depo&s;ited in the King's library. His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to permit Mr. Langton to take a copy of it for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The whole of it is rich in thought and imagery, and happy expre&s;&s;ions; and of the <HI>disjecta membra</HI> &s;cattered throughout, and as yet unarranged, a good dramatick poet might avail him&s;elf with con&s;iderable advantage. I &s;hall give my readers &s;ome &s;pecimens of different kinds, di&s;tingui&s;hing them by the Italick character.</P>

<SPEAKER>MAHOMET (to IRENE).</SPEAKER>
<P><HI> I have tried thee, and joy to find that thou de&s;erve&s;t to be loved by Mahomet,&mdash;with a mind great as his own. Sure, thou art an errour of nature, and an exception to the re&s;t of thy &s;ex, and art immortal; for &s;entiments like thine were never to &s;ink into nothing. I thought all the thoughts of the fair had been to &s;elect the graces of the day, di&s;po&s;e the colours of the flaunting (flowing) robe, tune the voice and roll the eye, place the gem, choo&s;e the dre&s;s, and add new ro&s;es to the fading cheek, but&mdash;&s;parkling.</HI></P>
</SP></Q>
<P>Thus in the tragedy:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Illu&s;trious maid, new wonders fix me thine;</L>
<L>"Thy &s;oul completes the triumphs of thy face:</L>
<L>"I thought, forgive my fair, the noble&s;t aim,</L>
<L>"The &s;tronge&s;t effort of a female &s;oul,</L>
<L>"Was but to choo&s;e the graces of the day,</L>
<L>"To tune the tongue, to teach the eyes to roll,</L>
<L>"Di&s;po&s;e the colours of the flowing robe,</L>
<L>"And add new colours to the faded cheek."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I &s;hall &s;elect one other pa&s;&s;age, on account of the doctrine which it illu&s;|trates. IRENE ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"that the Supreme Being will accept of virtue, whatever outward circum&s;tances it may be accompanied with, and may be delighted with varieties of wor&s;hip;&mdash;but is an&s;wered, that variety cannot affect that Being, who
<PB N="54" REF="83" MS="y">
 infinitely happy in his own perfections, wants no external gratifications; nor can infinite truth be delighted with fal&s;hood; that though he may guide or pity tho&s;e he leaves in darkne&s;s, he abandons tho&s;e who &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the beams of day."</HI></Q></P>
<P>John&s;on's re&s;idence at Lichfield, on his return to it at this time, was only for three months; and as he had as yet &s;een but a &s;mall part of the wonders of the metropolis, he had little to tell his town&s;men. He related to me the fol|lowing minute anecdote of this period: <Q REND="inline">"In the la&s;t age, when my mother lived in London, there were two &s;ets of people, tho&s;e who gave the wall, and tho&s;e who took it; the peaceable and the quarrel&s;ome. When I returned to Lichfield, after having been in London, my mother a&s;ked me, whether I was one of tho&s;e who gave the wall, or tho&s;e who took it. <HI>Now</HI> it is fixed that every man keeps to the right; or, if one is taking the wall, another yields it; and it is never a di&s;pute <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 232.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>He now removed to London with Mrs. John&s;on; but her daughter, who had lived with them at Edial, was left with her relations in the country. His lodgings were for &s;ome time in Wood&s;tock-&s;treet, near Hanover-&s;quare, and afterwards in Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, near Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare. As there is &s;omething plea&s;ingly intere&s;ting, to many, in tracing &s;o great a man through all his different habitations, I &s;hall, before this work is concluded, pre&s;ent my readers with an exact li&s;t of his lodgings and hou&s;es, in order of time, which, in placid conde&s;cen&s;ion to my re&s;pectful curio&s;ity, he one evening dictated to me, but without &s;pecifying how long he lived at each. In the progre&s;s of his life I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome of them as connected with particular incidents, or with the writing of particular parts of his works. To &s;ome, this minute attention may appear trifling; but when we con&s;ider the punctilious exactne&s;s with which the different hou&s;es in which Milton re&s;ided have been traced by the writers of his life, a &s;imilar enthu&s;ia&s;m may be pardoned in the biographer of John&s;on.</P>
<P>His tragedy being by this time, as he thought, completely fini&s;hed and fit for the &s;tage, he was very de&s;irous that it &s;hould be brought forward. Mr. Peter Garrick told me, that John&s;on and he went together to the Foun|tain tavern, and read it over, and that he afterwards &s;olicited Mr. Fleetwood, the patentee of Drury-lane theatre, to have it acted at his hou&s;e; but Mr. Fleetwood would not accept it, probably becau&s;e it was not patroni&s;ed by
<PB N="55" REF="84">
&s;ome man of high rank; and it was not acted till 1749, when his friend David <MILESTONE N="1738. Aetat. 29."> Garrick was manager of that theatre.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE,"</Q> begun and carried on by Mr. Edward Cave, under the name of SYLVANUS URBAN, had attracted the notice and e&s;teem of John&s;on, in an eminent degree, before he came to London as an adventurer in literature. He told me, that when he fir&s;t &s;aw St. John's Gate, the place where that de&s;ervedly popular mi&s;cellany was originally printed, he <Q REND="inline">"beheld it with reverence."</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e, indeed, that every young authour has had the &s;ame kind of feeling for the magazine or periodical pub|lication which has fir&s;t entertained him, and in which he has fir&s;t had an opportunity to &s;ee him&s;elf in print, without the ri&s;k of expo&s;ing his name. I my&s;elf recollect &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions from <Q REND="inline">"THE SCOTS MAGAZINE,"</Q> which was begun at Edinburgh in the year 1739, and has been ever conducted with judge|ment, accuracy, and propriety. I yet cannot help thinking of it with an affectionate regard. John&s;on has dignified the Gentleman's Magazine, by the importance with which he inve&s;ts the life of Cave; but he has given it &s;till greater lu&s;tre by the various admirable E&s;&s;ays which he wrote for it.</P>
<P>Though John&s;on was often &s;olicited by his friends to make a complete li&s;t of his writings, and talked of doing it, I believe with a &s;erious intention that they &s;hould all be collected on his own account, he put it off from year to year, and at la&s;t died without having done it perfectly. I have one in his own hand|writing, which contains a certain number; I indeed doubt if he could have recollected every one of them, as they were &s;o numerous, &s;o various, and &s;cattered in &s;uch a multiplicity of unconnected publications; nay, &s;everal of them publi&s;hed under the names of other per&s;ons, to whom he liberally con|tributed from the abundance of his mind. We mu&s;t, therefore, be content to di&s;cover them, partly from occa&s;ional information given by him to his friends, and partly from internal evidence <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">While in the cour&s;e of my narrative I enumerate his writings, I &s;hall take care that my readers &s;hall not be left to waver in doubt, between certainty and conjecture, with regard to their authenticity; and, for that purpo&s;e, &s;hall mark with an <HI>a&s;teri&s;k</HI> (*) tho&s;e which he acknowledged to his friends, and with a <HI>dagger</HI> (&dagger;) tho&s;e which are a&s;certained to be his by internal evidence. When any other pieces are a&s;cribed to him, I &s;hall give my rea&s;ons.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="57" REF="86" MS="y">It appears that he was now enli&s;ted by Mr. Cave as a regular coadjutor in his magazine, by which he probably obtained a tolerable livelihood. At what time, or by what means, he had acquired a competent knowledge both of French and Italian, I do not know; but he was &s;o well &s;killed in them, as to be &s;ufficiently qualified for a tran&s;lator. That part of his labour which con|&s;i&s;ted in emendation and improvement of the productions of other contri|butors, like that employed in levelling ground, can be perceived only by tho&s;e who had an opportunity of comparing the original with the altered copy. What we certainly know to have been done by him in this way, was the Debates in both hou&s;es of Parliament, under the name of <Q REND="inline">"The Senate of
<PB N="58" REF="87" MS="y"> Lilliput,"</Q> &s;ometimes with feigned denominations of the &s;everal &s;peakers, &s;ometimes with denominations formed of the letters of their real names, in the manner of what is called anagram, &s;o that they might ea&s;ily be decy|phered. Parliament then kept the pre&s;s in a kind of my&s;terious awe, which made it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to &s;uch devices. In our time it has acquired an unre&s;trained freedom, &s;o that the people in all parts of the king|dom have a fair, open, and exact report of the actual proceedings of their repre&s;entatives and legi&s;lators; which in our con&s;titution is highly to be valued, though, unque&s;tionably, there has of late been too much rea&s;on to complain of the petulance with which ob&s;cure &s;cribblers have pre&s;umed to treat men of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This important article of the Gentleman's Magazine was, for &s;everal years, executed by Mr. William Guthrie, a man who de&s;erves to be re&s;pectably recorded in the literary annals of this country. He was de&s;cended of an ancient family in Scotland; but having a &s;mall patrimony, and being an adhe|rent of the unfortunate hou&s;e of Stuart, he could not accept of any office in the &s;tate; he therefore came to London, and employed his talents and learn|ing as an <Q REND="inline">"Authour by profe&s;&s;ion."</Q> His writings in hi&s;tory, critici&s;m, and politicks, had con&s;iderable merit <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">How much poetry he wrote, I know not; but he informed me, that he was the authour of the beautiful little piece, <Q REND="inline">"The Eagle and Robin Redbrea&s;t,"</Q> in the collection of poems entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE UNION,"</Q> though it is there &s;aid to be written by Archibald Scott, before the year 1600.</NOTE>. He was the fir&s;t Engli&s;h hi&s;torian who had recour&s;e to that authentick &s;ource of information, the Parliamentary Journals; and &s;uch was the power of his political pen, that, at an early period, government thought it worth their while to keep it quiet by a pen&s;ion, which he enjoyed till his death. John&s;on e&s;teemed him enough to wi&s;h that his life &s;hould be written. The debates in Parliament, which were brought home and dige&s;ted by Guthrie, who&s;e memory, though &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by others who have &s;ince followed him in the &s;ame department, was yet very quick and tenacious, were &s;ent by Cave to John&s;on for his revi&s;ion; and, after &s;ome|time, when Guthrie had attained to greater variety of employment, and the &s;peeches were more and more enriched by the acce&s;&s;ion of John&s;on's genius it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould do the whole him&s;elf, from the &s;canty notes furni&s;hed by per&s;ons employed to attend in both hou&s;es of Parliament. Some|times, however, as he him&s;elf told me, he&punc; had nothing more communi|cated to him but the names of the &s;everal &s;peakers, and the part which they had taken in the debate.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="88" MS="y">
Thus was John&s;on employed, during &s;ome of the be&s;t years of his life, as a mere literary labourer <Q REND="inline">"for gain, not glory,"</Q> &s;olely to obtain an hone&s;t &s;upport. He however indulged him&s;elf in occa&s;ional little &s;allies, which the French &s;o happily expre&s;s by the term <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> and which will be noticed in their order, in the progre&s;s of this work.</P>
<P>But what fir&s;t di&s;played his tran&s;cendent powers, and <Q REND="inline">"gave the world a&s;&s;urance of the MAN,"</Q> was his <Q REND="inline">"LONDON, a Poem, in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal,"</Q> which came out in May this year, and bur&s;t forth with a &s;plendour, the rays of which will for ever encircle his name. Boileau had imitated the &s;ame &s;atire with great &s;ucce&s;s, applying it to Paris; but an attentive compari&s;on will &s;atisfy every reader, that he is much excelled by the Engli&s;h Juvenal. Oldham had al&s;o imitated it, and applied it to London; all which performances concur to prove, that great cities, in every age, and in every country, will furni&s;h &s;imilar topicks of &s;atire. Whether John&s;on had previou&s;ly read Oldham's imitation, I do not know; but it is not a little remarkable, that there is &s;carcely any coincidence found between the two performances, though upon the very &s;ame &s;ubject. The only in|&s;tances are, in de&s;cribing London as the <HI>&s;ink</HI> of foreign worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s:

<P>The particulars which Oldham has collected, both as exhibiting the hor|rours of London, and of the times, contra&s;ted with better days, are different from tho&s;e of John&s;on, and in general well cho&s;en, and well expre&s;t <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>I own it plea&s;ed me to find among&s;t them one trait of the manners of the age in London, in the la&s;t century, to &s;hield from the &s;neer of Engli&s;h ridicule, what was &s;ome time ago too common a practice in my native city of Edinburgh:</P>

 There are, in Oldham's imitation, many pro&s;aick ver&s;es and bad rhymes, and his poem &s;ets out with a &s;trange inadvertent blunder:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Tho' much concern'd to <HI>leave</HI> my dear old friend,</L>

<P>There is one pa&s;&s;age in the original, better transfu&s;ed by Oldham than by John&s;on:
<Q><L>"Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in &s;e,</L>
<L>"Qu&agrave;m quod ridiculos homines facit."</L></Q>
which is an exqui&s;ite remark on the galling meanne&s;s and contempt annexed to poverty: JOHNSON'S imitation is,

<P>Where, or in what manner this poem was compo&s;ed, I am &s;orry that I neglected to a&s;certain, with precision, from John&s;on's own authority. He has marked upon his corrected copy of the fir&s;t edition of it, <Q REND="inline">"Written in 1738;"</Q> and, as it was publi&s;hed in the month of May in that year, it is evident that much time was not employed in preparing it for the pre&s;s.

<P>WHEN I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago, I did not expect a repetition of the &s;ame plea&s;ure &s;o &s;oon; for a plea&s;ure I &s;hall always think it, to conver&s;e in any manner with an ingenious and candid man; but having the inclo&s;ed poem in my hands to di&s;po&s;e of for the benefit of the authour, (of who&s;e abilities I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, &s;ince I &s;end you his per|formance,) I believed I could not procure more advantageous terms from any per&s;on than from you, who have &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed your&s;elf by your generous encouragement of poetry; and who&s;e judgement of that art nothing but your commendation of my trifle<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">His Ode <Q REND="inline">"Ad Urbanum"</Q> probably.

I do not doubt but you will look over this poem with another eye, and reward it in a different manner, from a mercenary book&s;eller, who counts the lines he is to purcha&s;e, and con&s;iders nothing but the bulk. I can|not help taking notice, that, be&s;ides what the authour may hope for on account of his abilities, he has likewi&s;e another claim to your regard, as he lies at pre&s;ent under very di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances of fortune. I beg, therefore, that you will favour me with a letter to-morrow, that I may know what you can afford to allow him, that he may either part with it to you, or find out (which I do not expect) &s;ome other way more to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that as I am &s;en&s;ible I have tran&s;cribed it very coar&s;ely, which, after having altered it, I was obliged to do, I will, if you plea&s;e to tran&s;mit the &s;heets from the pre&s;s, correct it for you; and take the trouble of altering any &s;troke of &s;atire which you may di&s;like.</P>
<P>By exerting on this occa&s;ion your u&s;ual genero&s;ity, you will not only encourage learning, and relieve di&s;tre&s;s, but (though it be in compari&s;on of the other motives of very &s;mall account) oblige in a very &s;en&s;ible man|ner, Sir,</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>To us who have long known the manly force, bold &s;pirit, and ma&s;terly ver&s;ification of this poem, it is a matter of curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve the diffidence with which its authour brought it forward into publick notice, while he is &s;o cautious as not to avow it to be his own production; and with what humility he offers to allow the printer to <Q REND="inline">"alter any &s;troke of &s;atire which he might di&s;like."</Q> That any &s;uch alteration was made, we do not know. If we did, we could not but feel an indignant regret; but how painful is it to &s;ee that a writer of &s;uch vigourous powers of mind was actually in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, that the &s;mall profit which &s;o &s;hort a poem, however excellent, could yield, was courted as a <Q REND="inline">"relief."</Q></P>
<P>It has been generally &s;aid, I know not with what truth, that John&s;on offered his <Q REND="inline">"LONDON"</Q> to &s;everal book&s;ellers, none of whom would pur|cha&s;e it. To this circum&s;tance Mr. Derrick alludes in the following lines of his <Q REND="inline">"FORTUNE, A RHAPSODY:"</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="64" REF="93" MS="y"><LG>
<L> "Will no kind patron JOHNSON own?</L>
<L>"Shall JOHNSON friendle&s;s range the town?</L>
<L>"And every publi&s;her refu&s;e</L>
<L>"The offspring of his happy Mu&s;e?"</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>But we have &s;een that the worthy, mode&s;t, and ingenious Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley had ta&s;te enough to perceive its uncommon merit, and thought it creditable to have a &s;hare in it. The fact is, that, at a future conference, he bargained for the whole property of it, for which he gave John&s;on ten guineas, who told me, <Q REND="inline">"I might, perhaps, have accepted of le&s;s; but that Paul Whitehead had a little before got ten guineas for a poem; and I would not take le&s;s than Paul Whitehead."</Q></P>
<P>I may here ob&s;erve, that John&s;on appeared to me to undervalue Paul Whitehead upon every occa&s;ion when he was mentioned, and, in my opinion, did not do him ju&s;tice; but when it is con&s;idered that Paul Whitehead was a member of a riotous and profane club, we may account for John&s;on's having a prejudice again&s;t him. Paul Whitehead was, indeed, unfortunate in being not only &s;lighted by John&s;on, but violently attacked by Churchill, who utters the following imprecation:
<Q><L>"May I (can wor&s;e di&s;grace on manhood fall?)</L>
<L>"Be born a Whitehead, and baptiz'd a Paul!"</L></Q>
yet I &s;hall never be per&s;uaded to think meanly of the authour of &s;o brilliant and pointed a &s;atire as <Q REND="inline">"MANNERS."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"London"</Q> was publi&s;hed in May, 1738 <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Sir John Hawkins, p. 86, tells us <Q REND="inline">"The event is <HI>antedated,</HI> in the poem of 'London;' but in every particular, except the difference of a year, what is there &s;aid of the depart&ugrave;re of Thales, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of Savage, and looked upon as <HI>true hi&s;tory."</HI></Q> This conjecture is, I believe, entirely groundle&s;s. I have been a&s;&s;ured, that John&s;on &s;aid he was not &s;o much as acquainted with Savage when he wrote his <Q REND="inline">"London."</Q> If the departure mentioned in it was the departure of Savage; the event was not <HI>antedated</HI> but <HI>fore&s;een;</HI> for <Q REND="inline">"London"</Q> was publi&s;hed in May, 1738, and Savage did not &s;et out for Wales till July, 1739. However well John&s;on could defend the credibility of <HI>&s;econd &s;ight,</HI> he did not pretend that he him&s;elf was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that faculty.</NOTE>; and it is remark|able, that it came out on the &s;ame morning with Pope's &s;atire, entitled <Q REND="inline">"1738;"</Q> &s;o that England had at once is Juvenal and Horace as poetical monitors. The Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, to whom I am indebted for &s;ome obliging communications, was then a &s;tudent at
<PB N="65" REF="94" MS="y">
Oxford, and remembers well the effect which <Q REND="inline">"London"</Q> produced. Every body was delighted with it; and there being no name to it, the fir&s;t buz of the literary circles was <Q REND="inline">"here is an unknown poet, greater even than Pope."</Q> And it is recorded in the Gentleman's Magazine of that year <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">P. 269.</NOTE>, that it <Q REND="inline">"got to the &s;econd edition in the cour&s;e of a week."</Q></P>
<P>One of the warme&s;t patrons of this poem on its fir&s;t appearance was General OGLETHORPE, who&s;e <Q REND="inline">"&s;trong benevolence of &s;oul"</Q> was unabated during the cour&s;e of a very long life; though it is painful to think, that he had but too much rea&s;on to become cold and callous, and di&s;contented with the world, from the neglect which he experienced of his publick and private worth, by tho&s;e in who&s;e power it was to gratify &s;o gallant a veteran with marks of di&s;tinction. This extraordinary per&s;on was as remarkable for his learning and ta&s;te, as for his other eminent qualities; and no man was more prompt, active, and generous in encouraging merit. I have heard John&s;on gratefully acknowledge, in his pre&s;ence, the kind and effectual &s;upport which he gave to his <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> though unacquainted with its authour.</P>
<P>POPE, who then filled the poetical throne without a rival, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed, mu&s;t have been particularly &s;truck by the &s;udden appearance of &s;uch a poet; and, to his credit, let it be remembered, that his feelings and conduct on the occa&s;ion were candid and liberal. He reque&s;ted Mr. Richard&s;on, &s;on of the painter, to endeavour to find out who this new authour was. Mr. Richard&s;on, after &s;ome inquiry, having informed him that he had di&s;covered only that his name was John&s;on, and that he was &s;ome ob&s;cure man, Pope &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He will &s;oon be <HI>deterr&eacute;</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, from the information of the younger Richard&s;on.</NOTE>."</Q> We &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, from a note written by Pope, that he was him&s;elf afterwards more &s;ucce&s;sful in his inquiries than his friend.</P>
<P>That in this ju&s;tly-celebrated poem may be found a few rhymes which the critical preci&s;ion of Engli&s;h pro&s;ody at this day would di&s;allow, cannot be denied; but with this &s;mall imperfection, which in the general blaze of its excellence is not perceived, till the mind has &s;ub&s;ided into cool attention, it is, undoubtedly, one of the noble&s;t productions in our language, both for &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion. The nation was then in that ferment again&s;t the court and the mini&s;try, which &s;ome years after ended in the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole; and as it has been &s;aid, that Tories are Whigs when out of place, and Whigs, Tories when in place; &s;o, as a whig admini&s;tration ruled with what force it could, a tory oppo&s;ition had all the animation and all the
<PB N="66" REF="95" MS="y">
 eloquence of re&s;i&s;tance to power, aided by the common topicks of patrioti&s;m, liberty, and independence! Accordingly, we find in John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"London"</Q> the mo&s;t &s;pirited invectives again&s;t tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, the warme&s;t pre|dilection for his own country, and the pure&s;t love of virtue; inter&s;per&s;ed with traits of his own particular character and &s;ituation, not omitting his prejudices as a <Q REND="inline">"true-born Engli&s;hman <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">It is, however, remarkable, that he u&s;es the epithet, which, undoubtedly, &s;ince the union between England and Scotland, ought to denominate the natives of both parts of our i&s;land:
<Q><L>"Was early taught a BRITON'S rights to prize."</L></Q></NOTE>,"</Q> not only again&s;t foreign countries, but again&s;t Ireland and Scotland. On &s;ome of the&s;e topicks I &s;hall quote a few pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"The cheated nation's happy fav'rites &s;ee;</L>
<L>"Mark whom the great care&s;s, who frown on me."</L>
<L>"Has heaven re&s;erv'd, in pity to the poor,</L>
<L>"No pathle&s;s wa&s;te, or undi&s;cover'd &s;hore?</L>
<L>"No &s;ecret i&s;land in the boundle&s;s main?</L>
<L>"No peaceful de&s;art yet unclaim'd by Spain?</L>
<L>"Quick let us ri&s;e, the happy &s;eats explore,</L>
<L>"And bear Oppre&s;&s;ion's in&s;olence no more."</L>
<L>"How, when competitors like the&s;e contend,</L>
<L>"Can <HI>&s;urly Virtue</HI> hope to fix a friend?"</L>
<L>"This mournful truth is every where confe&s;s'd,</L>
<L>"SLOW RISES WORTH, BY POVERTY DEPRESS'D!"</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>We may ea&s;ily conceive with what feeling a great mind like his, cramped and galled by narrow circum&s;tances, uttered this la&s;t line, which he marked by capitals. The whole of the poem is eminently excellent, and there are in it &s;uch proofs of a knowledge of the world, and of a mature acquaintance with life, as cannot be contemplated without wonder, when we con&s;ider that he was then only in his twenty-ninth year, and had yet been &s;o little in the <Q REND="inline">"bu&s;y haunts of men."</Q></P>
<P>Yet, while we admire the poetical excellence of this poem, candour obliges us to allow, that the flame of patrioti&s;m and zeal for popular re&s;i&s;tance with which it is fraught, had no ju&s;t cau&s;e. There was, in truth, <HI>no</HI> <Q REND="inline">"oppre&s;&s;ion;"</Q> the <Q REND="inline">"nation"</Q> was <HI>not</HI> <Q REND="inline">"cheated."</Q> Sir Robert Walpole was a wi&s;e and a benevolent mini&s;ter, who thought that the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of a com|mercial country like ours, would be be&s;t promoted by peace, which he
<PB N="67" REF="96">
accordingly maintained, with credit, during a very long period. John&s;on him|&s;elf afterwards hone&s;tly acknowledged the merit of Walpole, whom he called <Q REND="inline">"a fixed &s;tar;"</Q> while he characteri&s;ed his opponent, Pitt, as <Q REND="inline">"a meteor."</Q> But John&s;on's juvenile poem was naturally impregnated with the fire of oppo|&s;ition, and upon every account was univer&s;ally admired.</P>
<P>Though thus elevated into fame, and con&s;cious of uncommon powers, he had not that bu&s;tling confidence, or, I may rather &s;ay, that animated ambition, which one might have &s;uppo&s;ed would have urged him to endea|vour at ri&s;ing in life. But &s;uch was his inflexible dignity of character, that he could not &s;toop to court the great; without which, hardly any man has made his way to high &s;tation. He could not expect to produce many &s;uch works as his <Q REND="inline">"LONDON,"</Q> and he felt the hard&s;hip of writing for bread; he was, therefore, willing to re&s;ume the office of a &s;choolma&s;ter, &s;o as to have a &s;ure, though moderate income for his life; and an offer being made to him of a &s;chool in Stafford&s;hire <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">In a billet written by Mr. Pope in the following year, this &s;chool is &s;aid to have been in <HI>Shrop&s;hire;</HI> but as it appears from a letter from Earl Gower, that the tru&s;tees of it were <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome worthy gentlemen in John&s;on's neighbourhood,"</Q> I conclude that Pope mu&s;t have, by mi&s;take, written Shrop&s;hire in&s;tead of Stafford&s;hire.</NOTE>, provided he could obtain the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts, Dr. Adams was applied to, by a common friend, to know whether that could be granted him as a favour from the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. But though he had made &s;uch a figure in the literary world, it was then thought too great a favour to be a&s;ked.</P>
<P>Pope, without any knowledge of him but from his <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> recom|mended him to Earl Gower, who endeavoured to procure for him a degree from Dublin, by the following letter to a friend of Dean Swift:

<P>It was, perhaps no &s;mall di&s;appointment to John&s;on that this re&s;pectable application had not the de&s;ired effect; yet how much rea&s;on has there been, both for him&s;elf and his country, to rejoice that it did not &s;ucceed, as he might probably have wa&s;ted in ob&s;curity tho&s;e hours in which he afterwards produced his incomparable works.</P>

He applied to Dr. Adams, to con&s;ult Dr. Smalbroke of the Commons, whether a per&s;on might be permitted to practice as an advocate there, without a doctor's degree in Civil Law. <Q REND="inline">"I am (&s;aid he) a total &s;tranger to the&s;e &s;tudies; but whatever is a profe&s;&s;ion, and maintains numbers, mu&s;t be within the reach of common abilities, and &s;ome degree of indu&s;try."</Q> Dr. Adams was much plea&s;ed with John&s;on's de&s;ign to employ his talents in that manner, being confident he would have attained to great eminence. And, indeed, I cannot conceive a man better qualified to make a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure as a lawyer; for, he would have brought to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion a rich &s;tore of various knowledge, an uncommon acutene&s;s, and a command of language, in which few could have equalled, and none have
<PB N="69" REF="98" MS="y">
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed him. He who could di&s;play eloquence and wit in defence of the deci&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Commons upon Mr. Wilkes's election for Middle|&s;ex, and of the uncon&s;titutional taxation of our fellow &s;ubjects in America, mu&s;t have been a powerful advocate in any cau&s;e. But here, al&s;o, the want of a degree was an in&s;urmountable bar.</P>
<P>He was, therefore, under the nece&s;&s;ity of per&s;evering in that cour&s;e, into which he had been forced; and we find, that his propo&s;al from Green|wich to Mr. Cave, for a tran&s;lation of Father Paul Sarpi's Hi&s;tory, was accepted <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In the Weekly Mi&s;cellany, October 21, 1738, there appeared the following adverti&s;ement: <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t publi&s;hed, Propo&s;als for printing the Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, tran&s;lated from the Italian of Father Paul Sarpi; with the Authour's Life, and Notes theological, hi&s;torical, and critical, from the French edition of Dr. Le Courayer. To which are added, Ob&s;ervations on the Hi&s;tory, and Notes and Illu&s;trations from various Authours, both printed and manu&s;cript. By S. John&s;on. 1. The work will con&s;i&s;t of two hundred &s;heets, and be two volumes in quarto, printed on good paper and letter. 2. The price will be 18<HI>s.</HI> each volume, to be paid, half a guinea at the time of &s;ub&s;cribing, half a guinea at the delivery of the fir&s;t volume, and the re&s;t at the delivery of the &s;econd volume in &s;heets. 3. Two-pence to be abated for every &s;heet le&s;s than two hundred. It may be had on a large paper, in three volumes, at the price of three guineas; one to be paid at the time of &s;ub&s;cribing, another at the delivery of the fir&s;t, and the re&s;t at the deli|very of the other volumes. The work is now in the pre&s;s, and will be diligently pro&s;ecuted. Sub|&s;criptions are taken in by Mr. Dod&s;ley in Pall-Mall, Mr. Rivington in St. Paul's Church-yard&punc; by E. Cave at St. John's Gate, and the Tran&s;lator, at No. 6 in Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, by Cavendi&s;h&punc; &s;quare."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some &s;heets of this tran&s;lation were printed off, but the de&s;ign was dropt; for it happened, oddly enough, that another per&s;on of the name of Samuel John&s;on, Librarian of St. Martin's in the Fields, and Curate of that pari&s;h, engaged in the &s;ame undertaking, and was patroni&s;ed by the Clergy, particu|larly by Dr. Pearce, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. Several light &s;kirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed between the rival tran&s;lators, in the new&s;papers of the day; and the con&s;equence was, that they de&s;troyed each other, for neither of them went on with the work. It is much to be regretted, that the able performance of that celebrated genius FRA PAOLO, lo&s;t the advantage of being incorporated into Briti&s;h literature by the ma&s;terly hand of John&s;on.</P>
<P>I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by the favour of Mr. John Nichols, a paper in John&s;on's hand-writing, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Account between Mr. Edward Cave and Sam. John&s;on, in relation to a ver&s;ion of Father Paul, &amp;c. begun Augu&s;t the 2d, 1738;"</Q> by which it appears, that from that day to the 21&s;t of April,

<P>I AM pretty much of your opinion, that the Commentary cannot be pro&s;ecuted with any appearance of &s;ucce&s;s; for as the names of the authours concerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrin&s;ick merit, the publick will be &s;oon &s;atisfied with it.

<P>It will, above all, be nece&s;&s;ary to take notice, that it is a thing di&s;tinct from the Commentary.</P>

<P>But although he corre&s;ponded with Mr. Cave concerning a tran&s;lation of Crou&s;az's Examen of Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man, and gave advice as one anxious for its &s;ucce&s;s, I was long ago conivnced by a peru&s;al of the Preface,
<PB N="72" REF="101"> that this tran&s;lation was erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed to him; and I have found this point a&s;certained, beyond all doubt, by the following article in Dr. Birch's Manu&s;cripts in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum:
<Q><L>"ELISIAE CARTERAE. S. P. D. THOMAS BIRCH.</L>

<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that this Mr. Macbean was a native of Scotland.</P>
<P>In the Gentleman's Magazine of this year, John&s;on gave a Life of Father Paul; * and he wrote the Preface to the Volume, &dagger; which, though prefixed to it when bound, is always publi&s;hed with the Appendix, and is therefore the la&s;t compo&s;ition belonging to it. The ability and nice adaptation with which he sould draw up a prefatory addre&s;s, was one of his peculiar excellencies.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="102" MS="y">
It appears too, that he paid a friendly attention to Mrs. Elizabeth Carter; <MILESTONE N="1739.

<P>In 1739, be&s;ide the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he gave to the Parliamentary Debates, his writings in the Gentleman's Magazine were, <Q REND="inline">"The Life of Boerhaave, *"</Q> in which it is to be ob&s;erved, that he di&s;covers that love of chymi&s;try which never for&s;ook him; <Q REND="inline">"An Appeal to the Publick in behalf of the Editor; &dagger;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"An Addre&s;s to the Reader; &dagger;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"An Epigram both in Greek and Latin to Eliza, *"</Q> and al&s;o Engli&s;h ver&s;es to her; * and, <Q REND="inline">"A Greek Epigram to Dr. Birch. *"</Q> It has been erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, that an E&s;&s;ay publi&s;hed in that Magazine this year, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Apotheo&s;is of Milton,"</Q> was written by John&s;on; and on that &s;uppo&s;ition it has been improperly in&s;erted in the edition of his works by the book&s;ellers, after his decea&s;e. Were there no po&s;itive te&s;timony as to this point, the &s;tyle of the performance, and the name of Shak&s;peare not being mentioned in an E&s;&s;ay profe&s;&s;edly reviewing the principal Engli&s;h poets, would a&s;certain it not to be the production of John&s;on. But
<PB N="74" REF="103">
 there is here no occa&s;ion to re&s;ort to internal evidence; for my Lord Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le has a&s;&s;ured me, that it was written by Guthrie. His &s;eparate pub|lications were, <Q REND="inline">"A Complete Vindication of the Licen&s;ers of the Stage, from the malicious and &s;candalous A&s;per&s;ions of Mr. Brooke, Authour of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, *"</Q> being an ironical Attack upon them for their Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Tragedy; and, <Q REND="inline">"Marmor Norfolcien&s;e; or an E&s;&s;ay on an ancient prophetical In&s;cription in monki&s;h Rhyme, lately di&s;covered near Lynne in Norfolk, by PROBUS BRITANNICUS. *"</Q> In this performance, he, in a feigned in&s;cription, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been found in Norfolk, the county of Sir Robert Walpole, then the obnoxious prime mini&s;ter of this country, inveighs again&s;t the Brun&s;wick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the mea&s;ures of government con&s;equent upon it. To this &s;uppo&s;ed prophecy he added a Commentary, making each expre&s;&s;ion apply to the times, with warm Anti-Hanoverian zeal.</P>
<P>This anonymous pamphlet, I believe, did not make &s;o much noi&s;e as was expected, and, therefore, had not a very exten&s;ive circulation. Sir John Hawkins relates, that <Q REND="inline">"warrants were i&s;&s;ued, and me&s;&s;engers employed to apprehend the authour; who, though he had forborne to &s;ub&s;cribe his name to the pamphlet, the vigilance of tho&s;e in pur&s;uit of him had di&s;covered;"</Q> and we are informed, that he lay concealed in Lambeth-mar&s;h till the &s;cent after him grew cold. This, however, is altogether without foundation; for Mr. Steele, one of the Secretaries of the Trea&s;ury, who, amid&s;t a variety of important bu&s;ine&s;s, politely obliged me with his attention to my inquiry, informs me, that <Q REND="inline">"he directed every po&s;&s;ible &s;earch to be made in the records of the Trea&s;ury and Secretary of State's Office, but could find no trace whatever of any warrant having been i&s;&s;ued to apprehend the authour of this pamphlet."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Marmor Norfolcien&s;e"</Q> became exceedingly &s;carce, &s;o that I, for many years, endeavoured in vain to procure a copy of it. At la&s;t I was indebted to the malice of one of John&s;on's numerous petty adver&s;aries, who, in 1775, publi&s;hed a new edition of it, <Q REND="inline">"with Notes and a Dedication to SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D. by TRIBUNUS;"</Q> in which &s;ome puny &s;cribbler invidiou&s;ly attempted to found upon it a charge of incon&s;i&s;tency again&s;t its authour, becau&s;e he had accepted of a pen&s;ion from his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and had written in &s;upport of the mea&s;ures of government. As a mortification to &s;uch impotent malice, of which there are &s;o many in&s;tances towards men of emi|nence, I am happy to relate, that this <HI>telum imbelle</HI> did not reach its exalted object, till about a year after it thus appeared, when I mentioned it to him, &s;uppo&s;ing that he knew of the re-publication. To my &s;urprize, he had not
<PB N="75" REF="104" MS="y">
yet heard of it. He reque&s;ted me to go directly and get it for him, which I  did. He looked at it and laughed, and &s;eemed to be much diverted with the feeble efforts of his unknown adver&s;ary, who, I hope, is alive to read this account. <Q REND="inline">"Now (&s;aid he) here is &s;omebody who thinks he has vexed me &s;adly; yet, if it had not been for you, you rogue, I &s;hould probably never have &s;een it."</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. Pope's note concerning John&s;on, alluded to in a former page, refers both to his <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> and his <Q REND="inline">"Marmor Norfolcien&s;e,"</Q> I have deferred in&s;erting it till now.

It was pre&s;ented to his Lord&s;hip by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, to whom it was given by the &s;on of Mr. Richard&s;on the painter, the per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. I have tran&s;cribed it with minute exactne&s;s, that the peculiar mode of writing, and imperfect &s;pelling of that celebrated poet, may be exhibited to the curious in literature. It ju&s;tifies Swift's epithet of <Q REND="inline">"paper|&s;paring Pope,"</Q> for it is written on a &s;lip no larger than a common me&s;&s;age|card, and was &s;ent to Mr. Richard&s;on, along with the Imitation of Juvenal.</P>

<P>John&s;on had been told of this note by Pope; and Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds informed him of the compliment which it contained, but, from delicacy, avoided &s;hewing him the paper it&s;elf. When Sir Jo&s;hua ob&s;erved to John&s;on that he &s;eemed very de&s;irous to &s;ee Pope's note, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Who would not be proud to have &s;uch a man as Pope &s;o &s;olicitous in inquiring about him?"</Q></P>
<P>The infirmity to which Mr. Pope alludes, appeared to me al&s;o, as I have el&s;ewhere<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 8.</NOTE> ob&s;erved, to be of the convul&s;ive kind, and of the nature of that di&s;temper called St. Vitus's dance; and in this opinion I am confirmed by the
<PB N="76" REF="105" MS="y">
 de&s;cription which Sydenham gives of that di&s;ea&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"This di&s;order is a kind of convul&s;ion.

If the hand of the &s;ame &s;ide be applied to the brea&s;t, or any other part of the body, he cannot keep it a moment in the &s;ame po&s;ture, but it will be drawn into a different one by a convul&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts to the contrary."</Q> Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, however, is of a different opinion, and has favoured me with the following paper.</P>
<Q><P>Tho&s;e motions or tricks of Dr. John&s;on are improperly called con|vul&s;ions. He could &s;it motionle&s;s, when he was told &s;o to do, as well as any other man; my opinion is, that it proceeded from a habit he had indulged him&s;elf in, of accompanying his thoughts with certain untoward actions, and tho&s;e actions always appeared to me as if they were meant to reprobate &s;ome part of his pa&s;t conduct. Whenever he was not engaged in conver&s;ation, &s;uch thoughts were &s;ure to ru&s;h into his mind; and, for this rea&s;on, any company, any employment whatever, he preferred to being alone. The great bu&s;ine&s;s of his life (he &s;aid) was to e&s;cape from him&s;elf; this di&s;po|&s;ition he con&s;idered as the di&s;ea&s;e of his mind, which nothing cured but company.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of his ab&s;ence and particularity, as it is characteri&s;tick of the man, may be worth relating. When he and I took a journey together into the We&s;t, we vi&s;ited the late Mr. Banks, of Dor&s;et&s;hire; the conver|&s;ation turning upon pictures, which John&s;on could not well &s;ee, he retired to a corner of the room, &s;tretching out his right leg as far as he could reach before him, then bringing up his left leg, and &s;tretching his right &s;till further on. The old gentleman ob&s;erving him, went up to him, and in a very courteous manner a&s;&s;ured him, that though it was not a new hou&s;e, the floor|ing was perfectly &s;afe. The Doctor &s;tarted from his reverie, like a per&s;on waked out of his &s;leep, but &s;poke not a word.</P></Q>
<P>While we are on this &s;ubject, my readers may not be di&s;plea&s;ed with another anecdote, communicated to me by the &s;ame friend, from the relation of Mr. Hogarth.</P>
<P>John&s;on u&s;ed to be a pretty frequent vi&s;iter at the hou&s;e of Mr. Richard&s;on, authour of Clari&s;&s;a, and other novels of exten&s;ive reputation. Mr. Hogarth came one day to &s;ee Richard&s;on, &s;oon after the execution of Dr. Cameron, for having taken arms for the hou&s;e of Stuart in 1745-6; and being a warm parti&s;an of George the Second, he ob&s;erved to Richard&s;on, that certainly there mu&s;t have been &s;ome very unfavourable circum&s;tances lately di&s;covered in this particular ca&s;e, which had induced the King to approve of an execution
<PB N="77" REF="106" MS="y">
for rebellion &s;o long after the time when it was committed, as this had the  appearance of putting a man to death in cold blood <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Impartial po&s;terity may, perhaps, be as little inclined as Dr. John&s;on was to ju&s;tify the uncom|mon rigour exerci&s;ed in the ca&s;e of Dr. Archibald Cameron. He was an amiable and truly hone&s;t man; and his offence was owing to a generous, though mi&s;taken principle of duty. Being obliged, after 1746, to give up his profe&s;&s;ion as a phy&s;ician, and go into foreign parts, he was honoured with the rank of Colonel, both in the French and Spani&s;h &s;ervice. He was a &s;on of the ancient and re&s;pectable family of Cameron, of Lochiel; and his brother, who was the Chief of that brave clan, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by moderation and humanity, while the Highland army marched victorious through Scotland. It is remarkable of this Chief, that though he had earne&s;tly remon&s;trated again&s;t the attempt as hopele&s;s, he was of too heroick a &s;pirit not to venture his life and fortune in the cau&s;e, when per&s;onally a&s;ked by him whom he thought his Prince.</NOTE>, and was very unlike his Maje&s;ty's u&s;ual clemency. While he was talking, he perceived a per&s;on &s;tanding at a window in the room, &s;haking his head, and rolling him&s;elf about in a &s;trange ridiculous manner. He concluded that he was an ideot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richard&s;on, as a very good man. To his great &s;urprize, however, this figure &s;talked forwards to where he and Mr. Richard&s;on were &s;itting, and all at once took up the argument, and bur&s;t out into an invective again&s;t George the Second, as one, who, upon all occa&s;ions, was unrelenting and barbarous; mentioning many in&s;tances, par|ticularly, that when an officer of high rank had been acquitted by a Court Martial, George the Second had, with his own hand, &s;truck his name o&s;f the li&s;t. In &s;hort, he di&s;played &s;uch a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with a&s;toni&s;hment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment in&s;pired. Neither Hogarth nor John&s;on were made known to each other at this interview.</P>

This Epitaph is &s;o exqui&s;itely beautiful, that I remember even Lord Kames, &s;trangely prejudiced as he was again&s;t Dr. John&s;on, was compelled to allow it very high prai&s;e.

John&s;on and he were &s;itting together; when, among&s;t other things, Garrick repeated an Epitaph upon this Philips by a Dr. Wilkes, in the&s;e words:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>At the &s;ame time that Mr. Garrick favoured me with this anecdote, he repeated a very pointed Epigram by John&s;on, on George the Second and Colley Cibber, which has never yet appeared, and of which I know not the exact date. Dr. John&s;on afterwards gave it to me him&s;elf.</P>

He this year, and the two following, wrote the Parliamentary Debates. He told me him&s;elf, that he was the &s;ole compo&s;er of them for tho&s;e three years only.
<PB N="79" REF="108" MS="y">
He was not, however, preci&s;ely exact in his &s;tatement, which he mentioned  from ha&s;ty recollection; for it is &s;ufficiently evident, that his compo&s;ition of them began November 19, 1740, and ended February 23, 1742-3.</P>
<P>It appears from &s;ome of Cave's letters to Dr. Birch, that Cave had better a&s;&s;i&s;tance for that branch of his Magazine, than has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed; and that he was indefatigable in getting it made as perfect as he could.</P>
<P>Thus, 21&s;t July, 1735, <Q REND="inline">"I trouble you with the inclo&s;ed, becau&s;e you &s;aid you could ea&s;ily correct what is herein given for Lord C&mdash;ld's &s;peech. I beg you will do &s;o as &s;oon as you can for me, becau&s;e the month is far advanced."</Q></P>
<P>And, 15th July, 1737. <Q REND="inline">"As you remember the Debates &s;o far as to per|ceive the &s;peeches already printed are not exact, I beg the favour that you will peru&s;e the inclo&s;ed, and, in the be&s;t manner your memory will &s;erve, correct the mi&s;taken pa&s;&s;ages, or add any thing that is omitted.

<P><Q REND="inline">"A gentleman has Lord Bathur&s;t's &s;peech to add &s;omething to."</Q></P>

But as I cannot expect to attain my de&s;ires in that re&s;pect, it would be a great &s;atisfaction to me, as well as an honour to our work, to have the favour of the genuine &s;peech. It is a method that &s;everal have been plea&s;ed to take, as I could &s;hew, but I think my&s;elf under a re&s;traint. I &s;hall &s;ay &s;o far, that I have had &s;ome by a third hand, which I under&s;tood well enough to come from the fir&s;t; others by penny-po&s;t, and others by the &s;peakers them&s;elves, who have been plea&s;ed to vi&s;it St. John's Gate, and &s;hew particular marks of their being plea&s;ed <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Birch's MSS. in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, 4302.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on, I believe, to doubt the veracity of Cave. It is, how|ever, remarkable, that none of the&s;e letters are in the years during which John&s;on alone furni&s;hed the Debates, and one of them is in the very year after he cea&s;ed from that labour. John&s;on told me, that as &s;oon as he found that the &s;peeches were thought genuine, he determined that he would write no more of them, for <Q REND="inline">"he would not be acce&s;&s;ary to the propagation of fal&s;hood."</Q> And &s;uch was the tenderne&s;s of his con&s;cience, that a &s;hort time before his
<PB N="80" REF="109">
 death he expre&s;&s;ed a regret for his having been the authour of fictions, which had pa&s;&s;ed for realities.</P>
<P>He neverthele&s;s agreed with me in thinking, that the Debates which he had framed were to be valued as Orations upon que&s;tions of publick importance. They have accordingly been collected in volumes, properly arranged, and recommended to the notice of parliamentary &s;peakers by a Preface, written by no inferiour hand <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the editor is Mr. George Chalmers, who&s;e commercial works are well known and e&s;teemed.</NOTE>. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that although there is in tho&s;e Debates a wonderful &s;tore of political information, and very powerful eloquence, I cannot agree that they exhibit the manner of each particular &s;peaker, as Sir John Hawkins &s;eems to think. But, indeed, what opinion can we have of his judgement, and ta&s;te in publick &s;peaking, who pre&s;umes to give, as the characteri&s;ticks of two celebrated orators, <Q REND="inline">"the deep-mouthed rancour of Pulteney, and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkins's Life of John&s;on, p. 100.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>This year I find that his tragedy of IRENE had been for &s;ome time ready for the &s;tage, and that his nece&s;&s;ities made him de&s;irous of getting as much as he could for it, without delay; for there is the following letter from Mr. Cave to Dr. Birch, in the &s;ame volume of manu&s;cripts in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum from whence I copied tho&s;e above quoted. They were mo&s;t obligingly pointed out to me by Sir William Mu&s;grave, one of the Curators of that noble repo&s;itory.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE><DATE>[No date.]</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE I am going to write a long letter, and have therefore taken a whole &s;heet of paper. The fir&s;t thing to be written about is our hi&s;torical de&s;ign.</P>
<P>You mentioned the propo&s;al of printing in numbers, as an alteration in the &s;cheme, but I believe you mi&s;took, &s;ome way or other, my meaning; I had no other view than that you might rather print too many of five &s;heets, than of five and thirty.</P>
<P>With regard to what I &s;hall &s;ay on the manner of proceeding, I would have it under&s;tood as wholly indifferent to me, and my opinion only, not my re&s;olution. <HI>Emptoris &s;it eligere.</HI></P>
<P>I think the in&s;ertion of the exact dates of the mo&s;t important events in the margin, or of &s;o many events as may enable the reader to regulate the order of facts with &s;ufficient exactne&s;s, the proper medium between a journal which has regard only to time, and a hi&s;tory which ranges facts according to their dependence on each other, and po&s;tpones or anticipates according to the convenience of narration. I think the work ought to partake of the &s;pirit of hi&s;tory, which is contrary to minute exactne&s;s, and of the regularity of a journal, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;pirit. For this rea&s;on, I neither admit numbers or dates, nor reject them.</P>
<P>I am of your opinion with regard to placing mo&s;t of the re&s;olutions, &amp;c. in the margin, and think we &s;hall give the mo&s;t complete account of par|liamentary proceedings that can be contrived. The naked papers, without an hi&s;torical treati&s;e interwoven, require &s;ome other book to make them un|der&s;tood. I will date the &s;ucceeding facts with &s;ome exactne&s;s, but I think in the margin. You told me on Saturday that I had received money on this work, and found &s;et down 13<HI>l.</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> reckoning the half guinea of la&s;t Saturday.

<PB N="83" REF="112" MS="y">
guineas for a &s;heet of copy, the re&s;t you may pay me when it may be more convenient&punc; and even by this &s;heet-payment I &s;hall, for &s;ome time, be very expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Life of Savage I am ready to go upon; and in Great Primer, and Pica notes, I reckon on &s;ending in half a &s;heet a day; but the money for that &s;hall likewi&s;e lye by in your hands till it is done. With the debates, &s;hall I not have bu&s;ine&s;s enough? if I had but good pens.</P>
<P>Towards Mr. Savage's Life what more have you got?

This was <Q REND="inline">"THE LIFE OF RICHARD SAVAGE; *"</Q> a man, of whom it is difficult to &s;peak impartially, without wondering that he was for &s;ome time the intimate companion of John&s;on; for his character was marked by profligacy, in&s;olence, and ingra|titude <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">As a &s;pecimen of his temper, I in&s;ert the following letter from him to a noble Lord, to whom he was under great obligations, but who, on account of his bad conduct, was obliged to di&s;card him.

</LETTER></NOTE>: yet, as he undoubtedly had a warm and vigorous, though unregulated mind, had &s;een life in all its varieties, and been much in the company of the &s;tate&s;men and wits of his time, he could communicate to John&s;on an abun|dant &s;upply of &s;uch materials as his philo&s;ophical curio&s;ity mo&s;t eagerly de&s;ired; and as Savage's misfortunes and mi&s;conduct had reduced him to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s as a writer for bread, his vi&s;its to St. John's Gate naturally brought John&s;on and him together <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Sir John Hawkins gives the world to under&s;tand, that John&s;on <Q REND="inline">"being an admirer of genteel manners, was captivated by the addre&s;s and demeanour of Savage, who, as to his exterior, was, to a remarkable degree, accompli&s;hed."</Q>&mdash;Hawkins's Life, p. 52. But Sir John's notions of gentility mu&s;t appear &s;omewhat ludicrous, from his &s;tating the following circum&s;tance as pre&s;umptive evidence that Savage was a good &s;word&s;man: <Q REND="inline">"That he under&s;tood the exerci&s;e of a gentleman's weapon, may be inferred from the u&s;e made of it in that ra&s;h encounter which is related in his life."</Q> The dexterity here alluded to was, that Savage, in a nocturnal &s;it of drunkenne&s;s, &s;tabbed a man at a coffee-hou&s;e, and killed him; for which he was tried at the Old-Bailey, and found guilty of murder.</P>
<P>John&s;on, indeed, de&s;cribes him as having <Q REND="inline">"a grave and manly deportment, a &s;olemn dignity of mien; but which, upon a nearer acquaintance, &s;oftened into an engaging ea&s;ine&s;s of manners."</Q> How highly John&s;on admired him for that knowledge which he him&s;elf &s;o much cultivated, and what kindne&s;s he entertained for him, appears from the following lines in the Gentleman's Maga|zine for April, 1738, which I am a&s;&s;ured were written by John&s;on:</P>

<P><PB N="88" REF="117" MS="y">
 It is melancholy to reflect, that John&s;on and Savage were &s;ometimes in &s;uch extreme indigence, that they could not pay for a lodging; &s;o that they have wandered together whole nights in the &s;treets. Yet in the&s;e almo&s;t incredible &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, we may &s;uppo&s;e that Savage mentioned many of the anecdotes with which John&s;on afterwards enriched the life of his unhappy companion, and tho&s;e of other Poets.</P>
<P>He mentioned to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, that one night in particular, when Savage and he walked round St. James's-&s;quare for want of a lodging, they were not at all depre&s;&s;ed by their &s;ituation, but in high &s;pirits and brimful of patrioti&s;m, traver&s;ed the &s;quare for &s;everal hours, inveighed again&s;t the mini&s;ter, and <Q REND="inline">"re&s;olved they would <HI>&s;tand by their country."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am afraid, however, that by a&s;&s;ociating with Savage, who was habituated to the di&s;&s;ipation and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Town, John&s;on, though his good principles remained &s;teady, did not entirely pre&s;erve that conduct, for which, in days of greater &s;implicity, he was remarked by his friend Mr. Hector; but was imperceptibly led into &s;ome indulgences which occa&s;ioned much di&s;tre&s;s to his virtuous mind.</P>
<P>That John&s;on was anxious that an authentick and favourable account of his extraordinary friend &s;hould fir&s;t get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the publick attention, is evident from a letter which he wrote in the Gentleman's Magazine for Augu&s;t of the year preceding its publication.</P>

<P>AS your collections &s;how how often you have owed the ornaments of your poetical pages to the corre&s;pondence of the unfortunate and inge|nious Mr. Savage, I doubt not but you have &s;o much regard to his memory as to encourage any de&s;ign that may have a tendency to the pre&s;ervation of it from in&s;ults or calumnies; and therefore, with &s;ome degree of a&s;&s;urance,
<PB N="89" REF="118" MS="y">
intreat you to inform the publick, that his life will &s;peedily be publi&s;hed by  a per&s;on who was favoured with his confidence, and received from him&s;elf an account of mo&s;t of the tran&s;actions which he propo&s;es to mention, to the time of his retirement to Swan&s;ea in Wales.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In February, 1744, it accordingly came forth from the &s;hop of Roberts, between whom and John&s;on I have not traced any connection, except the ca&s;ual one of this publication. In this work, although it mu&s;t be allowed that its moral is the rever&s;e of&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"Re&s;picere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo,"</HI></Q> a very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on is inculcated, to guard men of warm pa&s;&s;ions from a too free indulgence of them; and the various incidents are related in &s;o clear and animated a manner, and illuminated throughout with &s;o much philo&s;ophy, that it is one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting narratives in the Engli&s;h language. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds told me, that upon his return from Italy he met with it in Devon&s;hire, knowing nothing of its authour, and began to read it while he was &s;tanding with his arm leaning again&s;t a chimney-piece. It &s;eized his attention &s;o &s;trongly, that, not being able to lay down the book till he had fini&s;hed it, when he attempted to move, he found his arm totally benumbed. The rapidity with which this work was compo&s;ed, is a wonderful circum&s;tance. John&s;on has been heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a &s;itting; but then I &s;at up all night <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 35.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>He exhibits the genius of Savage to the be&s;t advantage, in the &s;pecimens of his poetry which he has &s;elected, &s;ome of which are of uncommon merit.
<PB N="90" REF="119" MS="y">
 We, indeed, occa&s;ionally find &s;uch vigour and &s;uch point, as might make us &s;uppo&s;e that the generous aid of John&s;on had been imparted to his friend. Mr. Thomas Warton made this remark to me; and, in &s;upport of it, quoted from the poem entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Ba&s;tard,"</Q> a line in which the fancied &s;upe|riority of one <Q REND="inline">"&s;tamped in Nature's mint with exta&s;y,"</Q> is contra&s;ted with a regular lawful de&s;cendant of &s;ome great and ancient family:
<Q><L>"No tenth tran&s;mitter of a fooli&s;h face."</L></Q>
but the fact is, that this poem was publi&s;hed &s;ome years before John&s;on and Savage were acquainted.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in this biographical di&s;qui&s;ition there appears a very &s;trong &s;ymptom of John&s;on's prejudice again&s;t players; a prejudice, which may be attributed to the following cau&s;es: fir&s;t, the imperfection of his organs, which were &s;o defective that he was not &s;u&s;ceptible of the fine impre&s;&s;ions which theatrical excellence produces upon the generality of mankind; &s;econdly, the cold rejection of his tragedy; and, la&s;tly, the brilliant &s;ucce&s;s of Garrick, who had been his pupil, who had come to London at the &s;ame time with him, not in a much more pro&s;perous &s;tate than him&s;elf, and who&s;e talents he undoubtedly rated low, compared with his own. His being out&s;tripped by his pupil in the race of immediate fame, as well as of fortune, probably made him feel &s;ome indignation, as thinking that whatever might be Garrick's merits in his art, the reward was too great when compared with what the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful efforts of literary labour could attain. At all periods of his life John&s;on u&s;ed to talk contemptuou&s;ly of players; but in this work he &s;peaks of them with peculiar acrimony; for which, perhaps, there was formerly too much rea&s;on from the licentious and di&s;&s;olute manners of tho&s;e engaged in that profe&s;&s;ion. It is but ju&s;tice to add, that in our own time &s;uch a change has taken place, that there is no longer room for &s;uch an unfavourable di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>His &s;choolfellow and friend, Dr. Taylor, told me a plea&s;ant anecdote of John&s;on's triumphing over his pupil David Garrick. When that great actor had played &s;ome little time at Goodman's-fields, John&s;on and Taylor went to &s;ee him per&s;orm, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard. John&s;on, who was ever depreciating &s;tage-players, after cen|&s;uring &s;ome mi&s;takes in empha&s;is which Garrick had committed in the cour&s;e of that night's acting, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"the players, Sir, have got a kind of rant, with which they run on, without any regard either to accent or empha&s;is."</Q> Both Garrick and Giffard were offended at this &s;arca&s;m, and endeavoured to refute it; upon which John&s;on rejoined, <Q REND="inline">"Well now, I'll give you &s;omething to &s;peak, with which you are little acquainted, and then we &s;hall &s;ee how ju&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="120" MS="y">
my ob&s;ervation is. That &s;hall be the criterion. Let me hear you repeat the  ninth Commandment, <Q REND="inline">"Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t thy neigh|bour."</Q></Q> Both tried at it, &s;aid Dr. Taylor, and both mi&s;took the empha&s;is, which &s;hould be upon <HI>not</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e witne&s;s.</HI> John&s;on put them right, and enjoyed his victory with great glee.</P>
<P>His <Q REND="inline">"Life of Savage"</Q> was no &s;ooner publi&s;hed, than the following liberal prai&s;e was given to it, in <Q REND="inline">"The Champion,"</Q> a periodical paper: <Q REND="inline">"This pamphlet is, without flattery to its authour, as ju&s;t and well written a piece as of its kind I ever &s;aw; &s;o that at the &s;ame time that it highly de&s;erves, it certainly &s;tands very little in need of this recommendation. As to the hi&s;tory of the unfortunate per&s;on, who&s;e memoirs compo&s;e this work, it is certainly penned with equal accuracy and &s;pirit, of which I am &s;o much the better judge, as I know many of the facts mentioned to be &s;trictly true, and very fairly related. Be&s;ides, it is not only the &s;tory of Mr. Savage, but innume|rable incidents relating to other per&s;ons, and other affairs, which renders this a very amu&s;ing, and, withal, a very in&s;tructive and valuable performance. The authour's ob&s;ervations are &s;hort, &s;ignificant, and ju&s;t, as his narrative is remarkably &s;mooth and well di&s;po&s;ed. His reflections open to all the rece&s;&s;es of the human heart; and, in a word, a more ju&s;t or plea&s;ant, a more engaging or a more improving treati&s;e, on all the excellencies and defects of human nature, is &s;carce to be found in our own, or, perhaps, any other language."</Q> This paper is well known to have been written by the celebrated Henry Fielding. But, I &s;uppo&s;e, John&s;on was not informed of his being indebted to him for this civility; for if he had been appri&s;ed of that circum&s;tance, as he was very &s;en&s;ible of prai&s;e, he probably would not have &s;poken with &s;o little re&s;pect of Fielding, as we &s;hall find he afterwards did.</P>
<P>John&s;on's partiality for Savage made him entertain no doubt of his &s;tory, however extraordinary and improbable. It never occurred to him to que&s;tion his being the &s;on of the Counte&s;s of Macclesfield, of who&s;e unrelenting bar|barity he &s;o loudly complained, and the particulars of which are related in &s;o &s;trong and affecting a manner in John&s;on's life of him. John&s;on was certainly well warranted in publi&s;hing his narrative, however offen&s;ive it might be to the Lady and her relations, becau&s;e her alledged unnatural and cruel conduct to her &s;on, and &s;hameful avowal of guilt, were &s;tated in a life of Savage now lying before me, which came out &s;o early as 1727, and no attempt had been made to confute it, or to puni&s;h the authour or printer as a libeller: but, for the honour of human nature, we &s;hould be glad to find the &s;hocking tale not true; and, from a re&s;pectable gentleman connected with the Lady's family, I
<PB N="92" REF="121" MS="y">
 have received &s;uch information and remarks, as joined to my own inquiries, will, I think, render it at lea&s;t &s;omewhat doubtful, e&s;pecially when we con|&s;ider that it mu&s;t have originated from the per&s;on him&s;elf who went by the name of Richard Savage.</P>
<P>If the maxim <HI>fal&s;um in uno, fal&s;um in omnibus,</HI> were to be received without qualification, the credit of Savage's narrative, as conveyed to us, would be annihilated; for it contains &s;ome a&s;&s;ertions which, beyond a que&s;tion, are not true.</P>
<P N="1">1. In order to induce a belief that Earl Rivers, on account of a criminal connection with whom, Lady Macclesfield is &s;aid to have been divorced from her hu&s;band, by Act of Parliament <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">1697.</NOTE>, had a peculiar anxiety about the child which &s;he bore to him, it is alledged, that his Lord&s;hip gave him his own name, and had it duly recorded in the regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I have carefully in&s;pected that regi&s;ter, but no &s;uch entry is to be found.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is &s;tated, that <Q REND="inline">"Lady Macclesfield having lived for &s;ome time upon very unea&s;y terms with her hu&s;band, thought a publick confe&s;&s;ion of adultery the mo&s;t obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty;"</Q> and John&s;on, a&s;&s;uming this to be true, &s;tigmati&s;es her with indignation, as <Q REND="inline">"the wretch who had, without &s;cruple, proclaimed her&s;elf an adultere&s;s."</Q> But I have peru&s;ed the Journals of both hou&s;es of Parliament at the period of her divorce, and there find it authentically a&s;certained, that &s;o far from voluntarily &s;ubmitting to the ignominious charge of adultery, &s;he made a &s;trenuous defence by her Coun&s;el; the bill having been fir&s;t moved 15th January, 1697, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and proceeded on, (with various applications for time to bring up witne&s;&s;es at a di&s;tance, &amp;c.) at intervals, till the 3d of March, when it pa&s;&s;ed. It was brought to the Commons, by a me&s;&s;age from the Lords, the 5th of March, proceeded on the 7th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th, on which day, after a full examination of witne&s;&s;es on both &s;ides, and hearing of Coun&s;el, it was reported without amendments, pa&s;&s;ed, and carried to the Lords.</P>
<P>That Lady Macclesfield was convicted of the crime of which &s;he was accu&s;ed, cannot be denied; but the que&s;tion now is, whether the per&s;on calling him&s;elf Richard Savage was her &s;on.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that when Earl Rivers was dying, and anxious to provide for all his natural children, he was informed by Lady Macclesfield that her &s;on by him was dead. Whether, then, &s;hall we believe that this was a malignant lie, invented by a mother to prevent her own child from receiving
<PB N="93" REF="122" MS="y">
the bounty of his father, which was accordingly the con&s;equence, if the per&s;on  who&s;e life John&s;on wrote, was her &s;on; or &s;hall we not rather believe that the per&s;on who then a&s;&s;umed the name of Richard Savage was an impo&s;tor, being in reality the &s;on of the &s;hoemaker, under who&s;e wife's care Lady Macclesfield's child was placed; that after the death of the real Richard Savage, he attempted to per&s;onate him, and that the fraud being known to Lady Macclesfield, he was therefore repul&s;ed by her with ju&s;t re&s;entment.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trong circum&s;tance in &s;upport of the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, though it has been mentioned as an aggravation of Lady Macclesfield's unnatural conduct, and that is, her having prevented him from obtaining the benefit of a legacy left to him by Mrs. Lloyd his god-mother. For if there was &s;uch a legacy left, his not being able to obtain payment of it, mu&s;t be imputed to his con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he was not the real per&s;on. The ju&s;t inference &s;hould be, that by the death of Lady Macclesfield's child before its god-mother, the legacy became lap&s;ed, and therefore that John&s;on's Richard Savage was an impo&s;tor. If he had a title to the legacy, he could not have found any difficulty in recovering it; for had the executors re&s;i&s;ted his claim, the whole co&s;ts, as well as the legacy, mu&s;t have been paid by them, if he had been the child to whom it was given.</P>
<P>The talents of Savage, and the mingled fire, rudene&s;s, pride, mean|ne&s;s, and ferocity of his character <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's companion appears to have per&s;uaded that lofty-minded man, that he re&s;embled him in having a noble pride; for John&s;on, after painting in &s;trong colours the quarrel between Lord Tyrconnel and Savage, a&s;&s;erts that <Q REND="inline">"the &s;pirit of Mr. Savage, indeed, never &s;uffered him to &s;olicit a reconciliation; he returned reproach for reproach, and in&s;ult for in&s;ult."</Q> But the re&s;pect|able gentleman to whom I have alluded, has in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a letter from Savage, after Lord Tyrconnel had di&s;carded him, addre&s;&s;ed to the Reverend Mr. Gilbert, his Lord&s;hip's Chaplain, in which he reque&s;ts him, in the humble&s;t manner, to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to the Earl.</NOTE>, concur in making it credible that he was fit to plan and carry on an ambitious and daring &s;cheme of impo&s;|ture, &s;imilar in&s;tances of which have not been wanting in higher &s;pheres, in the hi&s;tory of different countries, and have had a con&s;iderable degree of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet, on the other hand, to the companion of John&s;on, (who through whatever medium he was conveyed into this world,&mdash;be it ever &s;o doubtful <Q REND="inline">"To whom related, or by whom begot,"</Q> was, unque&s;tionably, a man of no common endowments,) we mu&s;t allow the weight of general repute as to his <HI>Status</HI> or parentage, though illicit; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be an impo&s;tor, it &s;eems &s;trange that Lord Tyrconnel, the nephew of Lady Macclesfield, &s;hould
<PB N="94" REF="123" MS="y">
 patroni&s;e him, and even admit him as a gue&s;t in his family <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Tru&s;ting to Savage's information, John&s;on repre&s;ents this unhappy man's being received as a companion by Lord Tyrconnel, and pen&s;ioned by his Lord&s;hip, as if po&s;teriour to Savage's con|viction and pardon. But I am a&s;&s;ured, that Savage had received the voluntary bounty of Lord Tyrconnel, and had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by him long before the murder was committed, and that his Lord&s;hip was very in&s;trumental in procuring Savage's pardon, by his interce&s;&s;ion with the Queen, through Lady Hertford. If, therefore, he had been de&s;irous of preventing any publication by Savage, he would have left him to his fate. Indeed I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that although John&s;on men|tions that Lord Tyrconnel's patronage of Savage was <Q REND="inline">"upon his promi&s;e to lay a&s;ide his de&s;ign of expo&s;ing the cruelty of his mother,"</Q> the great biographer has forgotten that he him&s;elf has mentioned, that Savage's &s;tory had been told &s;everal years before in <Q REND="inline">"The Plain Dealer,"</Q> from which he quotes this &s;trong &s;aying of the generous Sir Richard Steele, that <Q REND="inline">"the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father."</Q> At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Lady Macclesfield and her relations might &s;till wi&s;h that her &s;tory &s;hould not be brought into more con&s;picuous notice by the &s;atirical pen of Savage.</NOTE>. La&s;tly, it mu&s;t ever appear very &s;u&s;picious, that three different accounts of the Life of Richard Savage, one publi&s;hed in <Q REND="inline">"The Plain Dealer,"</Q> in 1724, another in 1727, and another by the powerful pen of John&s;on, in 1749, and all of them while Lady Macclesfield was alive, &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere attacks upon her, have been &s;uffered to pa&s;s without any publick and effectual contradiction.</P>
<P>I have thus endeavoured to &s;um up the evidence upon the ca&s;e, as fairly as I can; and the re&s;ult &s;eems to be, that the world mu&s;t vibrate in a &s;tate of uncertainty as to what was the truth.</P>
<P>This digre&s;&s;ion, I tru&s;t, will not be cen&s;ured, as it relates to a matter exceedingly curious, and very intimately connected with John&s;on, both as a man and an authour <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Ma&s;on, after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield by divorce, was married to Colonel Brett, and, it is &s;aid, was well known in all the polite circles. Colley Cibber, I am informed, had &s;o high an opinion of her ta&s;te and judgement as to genteel life and manners, that he &s;ubmitted every &s;cene of his <Q REND="inline">"Carele&s;s Hu&s;band,"</Q> to Mrs. Brett's revi&s;al and correction. Colonel Brett was reported to be too free in his gallantry with his Lady's maid. Mrs. Brett came into a room one day in her own hou&s;e, and found the Colonel and her maid both fa&s;t a&s;leep in two chairs. She tied a white handkerchief round her hu&s;band's neck, which was a &s;ufficient proof that &s;he had di&s;covered his intrigue; but &s;he never at any time took notice of it to him. This incident, as I am told, gave occa&s;ion to the well-wrought &s;cene of Sir Charles and Lady Ea&s;y and Edging.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He this year wrote the <Q REND="inline">"Preface to the Harleian Mi&s;cellany. *"</Q> The &s;election of the pamphlets of which it was compo&s;ed was made by Mr. Oldys, a man of eager curio&s;ity and indefatigable diligence, who fir&s;t exerted that &s;pirit of
<PB N="95" REF="124" MS="y">
inquiry into the literature of the old Engli&s;h writers, by which the works of our great dramatick poet have of late been &s;o &s;ignally illu&s;trated.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1745">
<P><MILESTONE N="1745. Aetat. 36."> In 1745 he publi&s;hed a pamphlet entitled <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations on the Tragedy of Macbeth, with Remarks on Sir T. H's (Sir Thomas Hanmer's) Edition of Shak&s;peare. *"</Q> To which he affixed, propo&s;als for a new edition of that poet.</P>
<P>As we do not trace any thing el&s;e publi&s;hed by him during the cour&s;e of this year, we may conjecture that he was occupied entirely with that work. But the little encouragement which was given by the publick to his anony|mous propo&s;als for the execution of a ta&s;k which Warburton was known to have undertaken, probably damped his ardour. His pamphlet, however, was highly e&s;teemed, and was fortunate enough to obtain the approbation even of the &s;upercilious Warburton him&s;elf, who, in the Preface to his Shak&s;peare publi&s;hed two years afterwards, thus mentioned it: <Q REND="inline">"As to all tho&s;e things which have been publi&s;hed under the titles of <HI>E&s;&s;ays, Remarks, Ob&s;ervations,</HI> &amp;c. on Shak&s;peare, if you except &s;ome critical notes on Macbeth, given as a &s;pecimen of a projected edition, and written, as appears, by a man of parts and genius, the re&s;t are ab&s;olutely below a &s;erious notice."</Q></P>
<P>Of this flattering di&s;tinction &s;hewn to him by Warburton, a very grateful remembrance was ever entertained by John&s;on, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He prai&s;ed me at a time when prai&s;e was of value to me."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1746">
<P><MILESTONE N="1746"> In 1746 it is probable that he was &s;till employed upon his Shak&s;peare, which perhaps he laid a&s;ide for a time, upon account of the high expectations which were formed of Warburton's edition of that great poet. It is &s;omewhat curious, that his literary career appears to have been almo&s;t totally &s;u&s;pended in the years 1745 and 1746, tho&s;e years which were marked by a civil war in Great-Britain, when a ra&s;h attempt was made to re&s;tore the Hou&s;e of Stuart to the throne. That he had a tenderne&s;s for that unfortunate Hou&s;e, is well known; and &s;ome may fancifully imagine, that a &s;ympathethick anxiety impeded the exertion of his intellectual powers: but I am inclined to think, that he was, during this time, &s;ketching the outlines of his great philo|logical work.</P>
<P>None of his letters during tho&s;e years are extant, &s;o far as I can di&s;cover. This is much to be regretted. It might afford &s;ome entertainment to &s;ee how he then expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his private friends, concerning &s;tate affairs. Dr. Adams informs me, that <Q REND="inline">"at this time a favourite object which he had in contemplation was 'The Life of Alfred,' in which, from the warmth with
<PB N="96" REF="125" MS="y">
which he &s;poke about it, he would, I believe, had he been ma&s;ter of his own will, have engaged him&s;elf, rather than on any other &s;ubject."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1747">
<P><MILESTONE N="1747. Aetat. 38."> In 1747 it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the Gentleman's Magazine for May was enriched by him with five &s;hort poetical pieces, di&s;tingui&s;hed by three a&s;teri&s;ks. The fir&s;t is a tran&s;lation, or rather a paraphra&s;e, of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer. Whether the Latin was his, or not, I have never heard, though I &s;hould think it probably was, if it be certain that he wrote the Engli&s;h; as to which my only cau&s;e of doubt is, that his &s;lighting character of Hanmer as an editor, in his <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on Macbeth,"</Q> is very different from that in the Epitaph. It may be &s;aid, that there is the &s;ame contrariety between the character in the Ob&s;ervations, and that in his own Preface to Shak&s;peare; but a con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed between the one publication and the other, whereas the Ob&s;ervations and the Epitaph came clo&s;e together. The others are, <Q REND="inline">"To Mi&s;s&mdash;, on her giving the Authour a gold and &s;ilk net-work Pur&s;e of her own weaving;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Stella in Mourning;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The Winter's Walk;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"An Ode;"</Q> and, <Q REND="inline">"To Lyce, an elderly Lady."</Q> I am not po&s;itive that all the&s;e were his productions; but as <Q REND="inline">"The Winter's Walk,"</Q> has never been con|troverted to be his, and all of them have the &s;ame mark, it is rea&s;onable to conclude that they are all written by the &s;ame hand. Yet to the Ode, in which we find a pa&s;&s;age very characteri&s;tick of him, being a learned de&s;crip|tion of the gout,
<Q><L>"Unhappy, whom to beds of pain</L>
<L><HI>"Arthritick</HI> tyranny con&s;igns;"</L></Q>
there is the following note: <Q REND="inline">"The authour being ill of the gout:"</Q> but John&s;on was not attacked with that di&s;temper till at a very late period of his life. May not this, however, be a poetical fiction? Why may not a poet &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to have the gout, as well as &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to be in love, of which we have innumerable in&s;tances, and which has been admirably ridiculed by John&s;on in his <Q REND="inline">"Life of Cowley?"</Q> I have al&s;o &s;ome difficulty to believe that he could produce &s;uch a group of <HI>conceits</HI> as appear in the ver&s;es to Lyce, in which he claims for this ancient per&s;onage as good a right to be a&s;&s;imi|lated to <HI>heaven,</HI> as nymphs whom other poets have flattered; he therefore ironically a&s;cribes to her the attributes of the <HI>&s;ky,</HI> in &s;uch &s;tanzas as this:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Her teeth the <HI>night</HI> with <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> dies,</L>
<L>"She's <HI>&s;tarr'd</HI> with pimples o'er;</L>
<L>"Her tongue like nimble <HI>lightning</HI> plies,</L>
<L>"And can with <HI>thunder</HI> roar."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="97" REF="126" MS="y">
But as at a very advanced age he could conde&s;cend to trifle in <HI>namby pamby</HI>  rhymes to plea&s;e Mrs. Thrale and her daughter, he may have, in his earlier years, compo&s;ed &s;uch a pieoe as this.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in this fir&s;t edition of <Q REND="inline">"The Winter's Walk,"</Q> the concluding line is much more John&s;onian than it was afterwards printed; for in &s;ub&s;equent editions after praying Stella to <Q REND="inline">"&s;natch him to her arms,"</Q> he &s;ays,
<Q><L>"And <HI>&s;hield</HI> me from the <HI>ills</HI> of life."</L></Q>
Whereas in the fir&s;t edition it is
<Q><L>"And <HI>hide</HI> me from the <HI>&s;ight</HI> of life."</L></Q>
A horrour at life in general is more con&s;onant with John&s;on's habitual gloomy ca&s;t of thought.</P>
<P>I have heard him repeat with great energy the following ver&s;es, which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for April this year; but I have no authority to &s;ay they were his own. Indeed one of the be&s;t criticks of our age &s;ugge&s;ts to me, that the word <HI>indifferently</HI> being u&s;ed in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>without concern,</HI> renders it improbable that they &s;hould have been his com|po&s;ition.</P>

<P><PB N="98" REF="127" MS="y"> This year his old pupil and friend, David Garrick, having become joint patentee and manager of Drury-lane theatre, John&s;on honoured his opening of it with a Prologue, * which for ju&s;t and manly dramatick critici&s;m, on the whole range of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, as well as for poetical excellence, is unrivalled. Like the celebrated Epilogue to the <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother,"</Q> it was, during the &s;ea&s;on, often called for by the audience. The mo&s;t &s;triking and brilliant pa&s;&s;ages of it have been &s;o often repeated, and are &s;o well recollected by all the lovers of the drama and of poetry, that it would be &s;uperfluous to point them out. In the Gentleman's Magazine for December this year, he in&s;erted an <Q REND="inline">"Ode on Winter,"</Q> which is, I think, an admirable &s;pecimen of his genius for lyrick poetry.</P>
<P>But the year 1747 is di&s;tingui&s;hed as the epoch, when John&s;on's arduous and important work, his DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, was announced to the world, by the publication of its Plan or <HI>Pro&s;pectus.</HI></P>
<P>How long this immen&s;e undertaking had been the object of his contem|plation, I do not know. I once a&s;ked him by what means he had attained to that a&s;toni&s;hing knowledge of our language, by which he was enabled to reali&s;e a de&s;ign of &s;uch extent, and accumulated difficulty. He told me, that <Q REND="inline">"it was not the effect of particular &s;tudy; but that it had grown up in his mind in&s;en&s;ibly."</Q> I have been informed by Mr. James Dod&s;ley, that &s;everal years before this period, when John&s;on was one day &s;itting in his brother Robert's &s;hop, he heard his brother &s;ugge&s;t to him, that a Dictionary of the Engli&s;h Language would be a work that would be well received by the publick; that John&s;on &s;eemed at fir&s;t to catch at the propo&s;ition, but, after a pau&s;e, &s;aid, in his abrupt deci&s;ive manner, <Q REND="inline">"I believe I &s;hall not undertake it."</Q> That he, however, had be&s;towed much thought upon the &s;ubject, before he publi&s;hed his <Q REND="inline">"Plan,"</Q> is evident from the enlarged, clear, and accurate views which it exhibits; and we find him mentioning in that tract, that many of the writers who&s;e te&s;timonies were to be produced as authorities, were &s;elected by Pope, which proves that he had been furni&s;hed, probably by Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley, with whatever hints that eminent poet had contributed
<PB N="99" REF="128" MS="y">
towards a great literary project, that had been the &s;ubject of important con|&s;ideration  in a former reign.</P>
<P>The book&s;ellers who contracted with John&s;on, &s;ingle and unaided, for the execution of a work, which in other countries has not been effected but by the co-operating exertions of many, were Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley, Mr. Charles Hitch, Mr. Andrew Millar, the two Me&s;&s;ieurs Longman, and the two Me&s;&s;ieurs Knapton. The price &s;tipulated was fifteen hundred and &s;eventy-five pounds.</P>
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"Plan"</Q> was addre&s;&s;ed to Philip Dormer, Earl of Che&s;terfield, then one of his Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, a nobleman who was very ambitious of literary di&s;tinction, and who, upon being informed of the de&s;ign, had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in terms very favourable to its &s;ucce&s;s. There is, perhaps, in every thing of any con&s;equence, a &s;ecret hi&s;tory which it would be amu&s;ing to know, could we have it authentically communicated. John&s;on told me <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">September 22, 1777, going from A&s;hbourne in Derby&s;hire, to &s;ee I&s;lam.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the way in which the Plan of my Dictionary came to be in&s;cribed to Lord Che&s;terfield, was this: I had neglected to write it by the time appointed. Dod&s;ley &s;ugge&s;ted a de&s;ire to have it addre&s;&s;ed to Lord Che&s;terfield. I laid hold of this as a pretext for delay, that it might be better done, and let Dod&s;ley have his de&s;ire. I &s;aid to my friend Dr. Bathur&s;t, 'Now if any good comes of my addre&s;&s;ing to Lord Che&s;terfield, it will be a&s;cribed to deep policy, when, in fact, it was only a ca&s;ual excu&s;e for lazine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the <Q REND="inline">"Plan"</Q> has not only the &s;ub&s;tantial merit of comprehen&s;ion, per&s;picuity, and preci&s;ion, but that the language of it is unexceptionably excellent, it being altogether free from that inflation of &s;tyle, and tho&s;e uncommon but apt and energetick words, which in &s;ome of his writings have been cen&s;ured with more petulance than ju&s;tice; and never was there a more dignified &s;train of compliment, than that in which he courts the attention of one whom he had been per&s;uaded to believe would be a re&s;pect|able patron.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With regard to que&s;tions of purity or propriety, (&s;ays he) I was once in doubt whether I &s;hould not attribute to my&s;elf too much in attempting to decide them, and whether my province was to extend beyond the propo&s;ition of the que&s;tion, and the di&s;play of the &s;uffrages on each &s;ide; but I have been &s;ince determined by your Lord&s;hip's opinion, to interpo&s;e my own judgement, and &s;hall therefore endeavour to &s;upport what appears to me mo&s;t con&s;onant to

<P>This pa&s;&s;age proves, that John&s;on's addre&s;&s;ing his <Q REND="inline">"Plan"</Q> to Lord Che&s;ter|field was not merely in con&s;equence of the re&s;ult of a report by means of Dod&s;ley, that the Earl favoured the de&s;ign; but that there had been a par|ticular communication with his Lord&s;hip concerning it. Dr. Taylor told me, that John&s;on &s;ent his <Q REND="inline">"Plan"</Q> to him in manu&s;cript, for his peru&s;al; and that when it was lying upon his table, Mr. William Whitehead happened to pay him a vi&s;it, and being &s;hewn it, was highly plea&s;ed with &s;uch parts of it as he had time to read, and begged to take it home with him, which he was allowed to do; that from him it got into the hands of a noble Lord, who carried it to Lord Che&s;terfield. When Taylor ob&s;erved this might be an advantage, John&s;on replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; it would have come out with more bloom, if it had not been &s;een before by any body."</Q></P>
<P>The opinion conceived of it by another noble authour, appears from the following extract of a letter from the Earl of Orrery to Dr. Birch:</P>

As three to &s;ixteen hundred, &s;o is the proportion of an Engli&s;hman to a Frenchman."</Q> With &s;o much ea&s;e and plea&s;antry could he talk of that prodigious labour which he had undertaken to execute.</P>
<P>The publick has had, from another pen, a long detail of what had been done in this country by prior Lexicographers, and no doubt John&s;on was wi&s;e to avail him&s;elf of them, &s;o far as they went; but the learned, yet judicious re&s;earch of etymology, the various, yet accurate di&s;play of definition, and the rich collection of authorities, were re&s;erved for the &s;uperiour mind of our great philologi&s;t. For the mechanical part, he employed, as he told me, &s;ix amanuen&s;es; and let it be remembered by the natives of North-Britain, to whom he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;o ho&s;tile, that five of them were of that country. There were two Me&s;&s;ieurs Macbean; Mr. Shiels, the writer of the Lives of the Poets to which the name of Cibber is affixed; Mr. Stewart, &s;on of Mr. George Stewart, book&s;eller at Edinburgh; and, a Mr. Maitland. The &s;ixth of the&s;e humble a&s;&s;i&s;tants was Mr. Peyton, who, I believe, taught French, and publi&s;hed &s;ome elementary tracts.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e painful labourers, John&s;on &s;hewed a never-cea&s;ing kindne&s;s, &s;o far as they &s;tood in need of it. The elder Mr. Macbean had afterwards the honour of being Librarian to Archibald, Duke of Argyle, for many years, but was left without a &s;hilling. John&s;on wrote for him a Preface to <Q REND="inline">"A Sy&s;tem of ancient Geography;"</Q> and, by the favour of Lord Thurlow, got him admitted a poor brother of the Charterhou&s;e. For Shiels, who died of a con&s;umption, he had much tenderne&s;s; and it has been thought that &s;ome choice &s;entences in the Lives of the Poets were &s;upplied by him. Peyton, when reduced to penury, had frequent aid from the bounty of John&s;on, who at la&s;t was at the expence of burying both him and his wife.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="133" MS="y">
 While the Dictionary was going forward, John&s;on lived part of the time in Holborn, part in Gough-&s;quare, Fleet-&s;treet; and he had an upper room fit|ted up like a counting-hou&s;e for the purpo&s;e, in which he gave to the copyi&s;ts their &s;everal ta&s;ks. The words, partly taken from other dictionaries, and partly &s;upplied by him&s;elf, having been fir&s;t written down with &s;paces left between them, he delivered in writing their etymologies, definitions, and various &s;ignifications. The authorities were copied from the books them|&s;elves, in which he had marked the pa&s;&s;ages with a black-lead pencil, the traces of which could ea&s;ily be effaced. I have &s;een &s;everal of them, in which that trouble had not been taken; &s;o that they were ju&s;t as when u&s;ed by the copyi&s;ts. It is remarkable, that he was &s;o attentive in the choice of the pa&s;&s;ages in which words were authori&s;ed, that one may read page after page of his Dictionary with improvement and plea&s;ure; and it &s;hould not pa&s;s unob&s;erved, that he has quoted no authour who&s;e writings had a tendency to hurt &s;ound religion and morality.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary expence of preparing a work of &s;uch magnitude for the pre&s;s, mu&s;t have been a con&s;iderable deduction from the price &s;tipulated to be paid for the copy-right. I under&s;tand that nothing was allowed by the book&s;ellers on that account; and I remember his telling me, that a large portion of it having, by mi&s;take, been written upon both &s;ides of the paper, &s;o as to be inconvenient for the compo&s;itor, it co&s;t him twenty pounds to have it tran&s;cribed upon one &s;ide only.</P>
<P>He is now to be con&s;idered as <Q REND="inline">"tugging at his oar,"</Q> as engaged in a &s;teady continued cour&s;e of occupation, &s;ufficient to employ all his time for &s;ome years, and which was the be&s;t preventive of that con&s;titutional melancholy which was ever lurking about him, ready to trouble his quiet. But his enlarged and lively mind could not be &s;atisfied without more diver&s;ity of employment, and the plea&s;ure of animated relaxation. He therefore not only exerted his talents in occa&s;ional compo&s;ition very different from Lexicography, but formed a club in Ivy-lane, Paterno&s;ter-row, with a view to enjoy literary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and amu&s;e his evening hours. The members a&s;&s;ociated with him in this little &s;ociety were his beloved friend Dr. Richard Bathur&s;t, Mr. Hawke&s;worth, afterwards well known by his writings, Mr. John Hawkins, an attorney <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">He was afterwards for &s;everal years Chairman of the Middle&s;ex Ju&s;tices, and upon occa&s;ion of pre&s;enting &s;ome addre&s;s to the King, accepted the u&s;ual offer of Knighthood. He is authour of <Q REND="inline">"A Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ick,"</Q> in five volumes in quarto. By a&s;&s;iduous attendance upon John&s;on in his la&s;t illne&s;s, he obtained the office of one of his executors; in con&s;equence of which, the book|&s;ellers of London employed him to publi&s;h an edition of Dr. John&s;on's works, and to write his Life.</NOTE>, and a few others of different profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="134">

<P>Mr. Dod&s;ley this year brought out his PRECEPTOR, one of the mo&s;t valuable books for the improvement of young minds that has appeared in any language; and to this meritorious work John&s;on furni&s;hed <Q REND="inline">"The Preface, *"</Q> containing a general &s;ketch of the book, with a &s;hort and per&s;picuous recommendation of each article; as al&s;o, <Q REND="inline">"The Vi&s;ion of Theodore the Hermit, found in his Cell, *"</Q> a mo&s;t beautiful allegory of human life, under the figure of a&s;cending the mountain of Exi&s;tence.

Mrs. John&s;on, for the &s;ake of country air, had lodgings at Hamp&s;tead, to which he re&s;orted occa&s;ionally, and there the greate&s;t part, if not the whole, of this Imitation was written. The fervid rapidity with which it was produced, is &s;carcely credible. I have heard him &s;ay, that he compo&s;ed &s;eventy lines of it in one day, without putting one of them upon paper till they were fini&s;hed. I remember when I once regretted to him that he had not given us more of Juvenal's Satires, he &s;aid he probably &s;hould give more, for he had them all in his head; by which I under&s;tood, that he had the originals and corre&s;pondent allu&s;ions floating in his mind, which he could, when he plea&s;ed, embody and render permanent without much labour.

<P>His <Q REND="inline">"Vanity of human Wi&s;hes"</Q> has le&s;s of common life, but more of a philo&s;ophick dignity than his <Q REND="inline">"London."</Q> More readers, therefore, will be delighted with the pointed &s;pirit of <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> than with the profound reflection of <Q REND="inline">"The Vanity of human Wi&s;hes."</Q> Garrick, for in&s;tance, ob&s;erved, in his &s;prightly manner, with more vivacity than regard to ju&s;t di&s;crimination, as is u&s;ual with wits, <Q REND="inline">"When John&s;on lived much with the Herveys, and &s;aw a good deal of what was pa&s;&s;ing in life, he wrote his 'London,' which is lively and ea&s;y.

<P>But <Q REND="inline">"The Vanity of human Wi&s;hes"</Q> is, in the opinion of the be&s;t judges, as high an effort of ethick poetry as any language can &s;hew. The in&s;tances of variety of di&s;appointment are cho&s;en &s;o judiciou&s;ly, and painted &s;o &s;trongly, that, the moment they are read, they bring conviction to every thinking mind.

<Q><L>"Hear Lydiat's life, and Galileo's end."</L></Q>
The hi&s;tory of Lydiat being little known, the following account of him may be acceptable to many of my readers. It appeared as a note in the Supplement to the Gentleman's Magazine for 1748, in which &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages extracted from John&s;on's poem were in&s;erted, and it &s;hould have been added in the &s;ub&s;equent editions.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A very learned divine and mathematician, fellow of New College, Oxon, and Rector of Okerton, near Banbury. He wrote, among many others, a Latin treati&s;e <Q REND="inline"><HI>"De natur&acirc; coeli,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> in which he attacked the &s;entiments of Scaliger and Ari&s;totle, not bearing to hear it urged, <HI>that &s;ome things are true in philo&s;ophy and fal&s;e in divinity.</HI> He made above 600 Sermons on the harmony of the Evangeli&s;ts. Being un&s;ucce&s;sful in publi&s;hing his works, he lay in the pri&s;on of Bocardo at Oxford, and in the King's Bench, till Bi&s;hop U&s;her, Dr. Laud, Sir William Bo&s;wel, and Dr. Pink, relea&s;ed him by paying his debts. He petitioned King Charles I. to be &s;ent into Ethiopia, &amp;c. to procure MSS. Having &s;poken in favour of monarchy and bi&s;hops, he was plundered by the parliament forces, and twice carried away pri&s;oner from his rectory; and afterwards had not a &s;hirt to &s;hift him in three months, without he borrowed it, and died very poor in 1646."</Q></NOTE>.

<P>Garrick being now ve&s;ted with theatrical power by being manager of Drury|lane theatre, he kindly and generou&s;ly made u&s;e of it to bring out John&s;on's tragedy, which had been long kept back for want of encouragement. But in this benevolent purpo&s;e he met with no &s;mall difficulty from the temper of John&s;on, which could not brook that a drama which he had formed with much &s;tudy, and had been obliged to keep more than the nine years of Horace,
<PB N="106" REF="137">
 &s;hould be revi&s;ed and altered at the plea&s;ure of an actor. Yet Garrick knew well, that without &s;ome alterations it would not he fit for the &s;tage. A violent di&s;pute having en&s;ued between them, Garrick applied to the Reverend Dr. Taylor to interpo&s;e. John&s;on was at fir&s;t very ob&s;tinate. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) the fellow wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that be may have an oppor|tunity of to&s;&s;ing his hands and kicking his heels <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mahomet was, in fact, played by Mr. Barry, and Demetrius by Mr. Garrick; but probably at this time the parts were not yet ca&s;t.</NOTE>."</Q> He was, however, at la&s;t, with difficulty, prevailed on to comply with Garrick's wi&s;hes, &s;o as to allow of &s;ome changes; but &s;till there were not enough.</P>
<P>Dr. Adams was pre&s;ent the fir&s;t night of the repre&s;entation of IRENE, and gave me the following account: <Q REND="inline">"Before the curtain drew up, there were catcalls whi&s;tling, which alarmed John&s;on's friends. The Prologue, which was written by him&s;elf in a manly &s;train, &s;oothed the audience <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>The expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by Dr. Adams was <Q REND="inline">"&s;oothed."</Q> I &s;hould rather think the audience was <HI>awed</HI> by the extraordinary &s;pirit and dignity of the following lines:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Be this at lea&s;t his prai&s;e, be this his pride,</L>
<L>"To force applau&s;e no modern arts are tried:</L>
<L>"Should partial catcalls all his hopes confound,</L>
<L>"He bids no trumpet quell the fatal &s;ound;</L>
<L>"Should welcome &s;leep relieve the weary wit,</L>
<L>"He rolls no thunders o'er the drow&s;y pit;</L>
<L>"No &s;nares to captivate the judgement &s;preads,</L>

<L>"Unmov'd, though witlings &s;neer and rivals rail,</L>
<L>"Studious to plea&s;e, yet not a&s;hamed to fail,</L>
<L>"He &s;corns the meek addre&s;s, the &s;uppliant &s;train,</L>

<L>"In Rea&s;on, Nature, Truth, he dares to tru&s;t;</L>
<L>"Ye fops be &s;ilent, and ye wits be ju&s;t!"</L>
</LG></Q></NOTE>, and the play went off tolerably till it came to the conclu&s;ion, when Mrs. Pritchard, the heroine of the piece, was to be &s;trangled upon the &s;tage, and was to &s;peak two lines with the bow-&s;tring round her neck. The audience cried out <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Murder, murder."</HI></Q> She &s;everal times attempted to &s;peak, but in vain. At la&s;t &s;he was obliged to go off the &s;tage alive."</Q> This pa&s;&s;age was afterwards &s;truck out, and &s;he was carried off to be put to death behind the &s;cenes, as the play now has it. The Epilogue was written by Sir William Young. I know not how John&s;on's play came to be thus graced by the pen of a per&s;on then &s;o eminent in the political world.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="138" MS="y">
Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;upport of &s;uch performers as Garrick, Barry, Mrs.  Cibber, Mrs. Pritchard, and every advantage of dre&s;s and decoration, the tragedy of Irene did not plea&s;e the publick. Mr. Garrick's zeal carried it through for nine nights, &s;o that the authour had his three nights' profits; and from a receipt &s;igned by him, now in the hands of Mr. James Dod&s;ley, it appears that his friend Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley gave him one hundred pounds for the copy, with his u&s;ual re&s;ervation of the right of one edition.</P>
<P>IRENE, con&s;idered as a poem, is intitled to the prai&s;e of &s;uperiour excellence. Analy&s;ed into parts, it will furni&s;h a rich &s;tore of noble &s;entiments, fine imagery, and beautiful language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principal end of the drama. Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that John&s;on not only had not the faculty of producing the impre&s;&s;ions of tragedy, but that he had not the &s;en&s;ibility to perceive them. His great friend Mr. Walm&s;ley's prediction, that he would <Q REND="inline">"turn out a fine tragedy-writer,"</Q> was, therefore, ill founded. John&s;on was wi&s;e enough to be convinced that he had not the talents nece&s;|&s;ary to write &s;ucce&s;sfully for the &s;tage, and never made another attempt in that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>When a&s;ked how he felt upon the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his tragedy, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Like the Monument;"</Q> meaning that he continued firm and unmoved as that column. And let it be remembered, as an admonition to the <HI>genus irritabile</HI> of dramatick writers, that this great man, in&s;tead of peevi&s;hly com|plaining of the bad ta&s;te of the town, &s;ubmitted to its deci&s;ion without a murmur. He had, indeed, upon all occa&s;ions a great deference for the general opinion: <Q REND="inline">"A man (&s;aid he) who writes a book, thinks him&s;elf wi&s;er or wittier than the re&s;t of mankind; he &s;uppo&s;es that he can in&s;truct or amu&s;e them, and the publick to whom he appeals, mu&s;t, after all, be the judges of his preten&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>On occa&s;ion of his play being brought upon the &s;tage, John&s;on had a fancy that as a dramatick authour his dre&s;s &s;hould be more gay than what he ordi|narily wore; he therefore appeared behind the &s;cenes, and even in one of the &s;ide boxes, in a &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat, with rich gold lace. His nece&s;&s;ary attendance while his play was in rehear&s;al, and during its performance, brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both &s;exes, which produced a more favourable opinion of their profe&s;&s;ion than he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;hly expre&s;&s;ed in his Life of Savage. With &s;ome of them he kept up an acquaintance as long as he and they lived, and was ever ready to &s;hew them acts of kindne&s;s. He for a con&s;iderable time u&s;ed to frequent the <HI>Green Room,</HI> and &s;eemed to take
<PB N="108" REF="139" MS="y">
 delight in di&s;&s;ipating his gloom, by mixing in the &s;prightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr. David Hume related to me from Mr. Garrick, that John&s;on at la&s;t denied him&s;elf this amu&s;ement, from con|&s;iderations of rigid virtue; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I'll come no more behind your &s;cenes, David; for the &s;ilk &s;tockings and white bo&s;oms of your actre&s;&s;es excite my amorous propen&s;ities."</Q></P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1750"> In 1750 he came forth in the character for which he was eminently qualified, a maje&s;tick teacher of moral and religious wi&s;dom.

<P>The fir&s;t paper of the Rambler was publi&s;hed on Tue&s;day the 20th of March, 1750; and its authour was enabled to continue it, without interrup|tion, every Tue&s;day and Friday, till Saturday the 17th of March, 1752, on which day it clo&s;ed. This is a &s;trong confirmation of the truth of a remark of his, which I have had occa&s;ion to quote el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 28.</NOTE>, that <Q REND="inline">"a man may write at any time, if he will &s;et him&s;elf doggedly to it;"</Q> for, notwith&s;tanding his con&s;titutional indolence, his depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, and his labour in carrying on his Dictionary, he an&s;wered the &s;tated calls of the pre&s;s twice a week from the &s;tores of his mind, during all that time having received no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, except four billets in No. 10 by Mi&s;s Mul&s;o, now Mrs. Chapone; No. 30, by Mrs. Catharine Talbot; No. 97, by Mr. Samuel Richard&s;on, whom he de&s;cribes in an introductory note as <Q REND="inline">"An authour who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the pa&s;&s;ions to move at the command of virtue;"</Q> and Numbers 44 and 100, by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter.</P>
<P>Po&s;terity will be a&s;toni&s;hed when they are told, upon the authority of John&s;on him&s;elf, that many of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, which we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e had been laboured with all the &s;low attention of literary lei&s;ure, were writen in ha&s;te as the moment pre&s;&s;ed, without even being read over by him before they were printed. It can be accounted for only in this way; that by reading and medi|tation, and a very clo&s;e in&s;pection of life, he had accumulated a great fund of mi&s;cellaneous knowledge, which, by a peculiar promptitude of mind, was ever ready at his call, and which he had con&s;tantly accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to clothe in the mo&s;t apt and energetick expre&s;&s;ion. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds once a&s;ked him by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of language. He told him, that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his be&s;t on every occa&s;ion, and in every company; to impart whatever he knew in the mo&s;t forcible language he could put it in; and that by con&s;tant practice, and never &s;uffering any carele&s;s expre&s;&s;ions to e&s;cape him, or attempt|ing to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the cleare&s;t manner, it became habitual to him.</P>
<P>Yet he was not altogether unprepared as a periodical writer; for I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;mall duodecimo volume, in which he has written, in the
<PB N="110" REF="141" MS="y">
 form of Mr. Locke's Common-Place Book, a variety of hints for e&s;&s;ays on different &s;ubjects. He has marked upon the fir&s;t blank leaf of it, <Q REND="inline">"To the 128th page, collections for the RAMBLER;"</Q> and in another place, <Q REND="inline">"In fifty-two there were &s;eventeen provided; in 97&mdash;21; in 190&mdash;25."</Q> At a &s;ub&s;e|quent period (probably after the work was fini&s;hed) he added, <Q REND="inline">"In all, taken of provided materials, 30."</Q></P>
<P>Sir John Hawkins, who is unlucky upon all occa&s;ions, tells us, that <Q REND="inline">"this method of accumulating intelligence had been practi&s;ed by Mr. Addi&s;on, and is humourou&s;ly de&s;cribed in one of the Spectators, wherein he feigns to have dropped his paper of <HI>notanda,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a diverting medley of broken &s;entences and loo&s;e hints, which he tells us he had collected, and meant to make u&s;e of. Much of the &s;ame kind is John&s;on's Adver&s;aria <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Hawkin's Life of John&s;on, p. 268.</NOTE>."</Q> But the truth is, that there is no re&s;emblance at all between them. Addi&s;on's note was a fiction, in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were pur|po&s;ely jumbled together, in as odd a manner as he could, in order to produce a laughable effect. Whereas John&s;on's abbreviations are all di&s;tinct, and applicable to each &s;ubject of which the head is mentioned.</P>

<P>Here we &s;ee the embryo of No. 45 of the Adventurer; and it is a con|firmation of what I have mentioned, that the papers in that collection marked T. were written by John&s;on.</P>
<P>This &s;canty preparation of materials will not, however, much dimini&s;h our wonder at the extraordinary fertility of his mind: for the proportion which they bear to the number of e&s;&s;ays which he wrote, is very &s;mall; and it is remarkable, that tho&s;e for which he had made no preparation, are as rich and as highly fini&s;hed, as tho&s;e for which the hints were lying by him.

As the Rambler was entirely the work of one man, there was, of cour&s;e,  &s;uch an uniformity in its texture, as very much to exclude the charm of variety; and the grave and often &s;olemn ca&s;t of thinking, which di&s;tingui&s;hed it from other periodical papers, made it, for &s;ome time, not generally liked. So &s;lowly did this excellent work, of which twelve editions have now i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s, gain upon the world at large, that even in the clo&s;ing number the authour &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I have never been much a favourite of the publick."</Q></P>
<P>Yet, very &s;oon after its commencement, there were who felt and acknow|ledged its uncommon excellence. Ver&s;es in its prai&s;e appeared in the new&s;|papers; and the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine mentions, in October, his having received &s;everal letters to the &s;ame purpo&s;e from the learned. <Q REND="inline">"The Student, or Oxford and Cambridge Mi&s;cellany,"</Q> in which Mr. Bonnell Thornton and Mr. Colman were the principal writers, de&s;cribes it as <Q REND="inline">"a work that exceeds any thing of the kind ever publi&s;hed in this kingdom, &s;ome of the Spectators excepted,&mdash;if indeed they may be excepted."</Q> And after|wards, <Q REND="inline">"May the publick favours crown his merits, and may not the Engli&s;h, under the au&s;picious reign of GEORGE the Second, neglect a man, who, had he lived in the fir&s;t century, would have been one of the greate&s;t favourites of AUGUSTUS."</Q> This flattery of the monarch had no effect. It is too well known, that the &s;econd George never was an Augu&s;tus to learning or genius.</P>
<P>John&s;on told me, with an amiable fondne&s;s, a little plea&s;ing circum&s;tance relative to this work. Mrs. John&s;on, in who&s;e judgement and ta&s;te he had great confidence, &s;aid to him, after a few numbers of the Rambler had come out, <Q REND="inline">"I thought very well of you before; but I did not imagine you could have written any thing equal to this."</Q> Di&s;tant prai&s;e, from whatever quarter, is not &s;o delightful as that of a wife whom a man loves and e&s;teems. Her approbation may be &s;aid to <Q REND="inline">"come home to his <HI>bo&s;om;"</HI></Q> and being &s;o near, its effect is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and permanent.</P>
<P>Mr. James Elphin&s;ton, who has &s;ince publi&s;hed various works, and who was ever e&s;teemed by John&s;on as a worthy man, happened to be in Scotland while the Rambler was coming out in &s;ingle papers at London. With a laudable zeal at once for the improvement of his countrymen and the repu|tation of his friend, he &s;ugge&s;ted and took the charge of an edition of tho&s;e E&s;&s;ays at Edinburgh, which followed progre&s;&s;ively the London publication <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">It was executed in the printing-office of Sands, Murray, and Cochran, with uncommon elegance, upon writing paper, of a duodecimo &s;ize, and with the greate&s;t correctne&s;s; and Mr. Elphin&s;ton enriched it with tran&s;lations of the mottos. When completed, it made eight hand&s;ome volumes. It is, unque&s;tionably, the mo&s;t accurate and beautiful edition of this work; and there being but a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion, it is now become &s;carce, and &s;ells at a very high price.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I CANNOT but confe&s;s the failures of my corre&s;pondence, but hope the &s;ame regard which you expre&s;s for me on every other occa&s;ion, will incline you to forgive me. I am often, very often, ill; and, when I am well, am obliged to work: and, indeed, have never much u&s;ed my&s;elf to punctuality. You are, however, not to make unkind inferences, when I forbear to reply to your kindne&s;s; for be a&s;&s;ured, I never receive a letter from you without great plea&s;ure, and a very warm &s;en&s;e of your genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip, which I heartily blame my&s;elf for not cultivating with more care. In this, as in many other ca&s;es, I go wrong, in oppo&s;ition to conviction; for I think &s;carce any temporal good equally to be de&s;ired with the regard and familiarity of worthy men. I hope we &s;hall be &s;ome time nearer to each other, and have a more ready way of pouring out our hearts.</P>
<P>I am glad that you &s;till find encouragement to proceed in your publi|cation, and &s;hall beg the favour of &s;ix more volumes to add to my former &s;ix, when you can, with any convenience, &s;end them me. Plea&s;e to pre&s;ent a &s;et, in my name, to Mr. Ruddiman <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mr. Thomas Ruddiman, the learned grammarian of Scotland, well known for his various excellent works, and for his accurate editions of &s;everal authours.

<P>YOU have, as I find by every kind of evidence, lo&s;t an excellent mother; and I hope you will not think me incapable of partaking of your grief. I have a mother, now eighty-two years of age, whom, therefore, I mu&s;t &s;oon lo&s;e, unle&s;s it plea&s;e GOD that &s;he rather &s;hould mourn for me. I read the leters in which you relate your mother's death to Mrs. Strahan, and think I do my&s;elf honour, when I tell you that I read them with tears; but tears are neither to <HI>you</HI> nor to <HI>me</HI> of any further u&s;e, when once the tribute of nature has been paid. The bu&s;ine&s;s of life &s;ummons us away from u&s;ele&s;s grief, and calls us to the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e virtues of which we are lamenting our deprivation. The greate&s;t benefit which one friend can confer upon another, is to guard, and excite, and elevate his virtues. This your mother will &s;till perform, if you diligently pre&s;erve the memory of her life, and of her death: a life, &s;o far as I can learn, u&s;eful, wi&s;e, and innocent; and a death re&s;igned, peaceful, and holy. I cannot forbear to mention, that neither rea&s;on nor revelation denies you to hope, that you may increa&s;e her happine&s;s by obey|ing her precepts; and that &s;he may in her pre&s;ent &s;tate look with plea&s;ure upon every act of virtue to which her in&s;tructions or example have contributed. Whether this be more than a plea&s;ing dream, or a ju&s;t opinion of &s;eparate &s;pirits, is, indeed, of no great importance to us, when we con&s;ider our&s;elves as acting under the eye of GOD: yet, &s;urely, there is &s;omething plea&s;ing in the belief, that our &s;eparation from tho&s;e whom we love is merely corporeal; and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friend&s;hip, if it can be made probable, that that union that has received the divine approbation &s;hall continue to eternity.</P>
<P>There is one expedient by which you may, in &s;ome degree, continue her pre&s;ence. If you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earlie&s;t years, you will read it with great plea&s;ure, and receive from it many hints of &s;oothing reollection, when time &s;hall remove her yet farther from you, and your grief &s;hall be matured to veneration. To this, however painful for the pre&s;ent, I cannot but advi&s;e you, as to a &s;ource of comfort and &s;atisfaction in the time to come; for all comfort and all &s;atisfaction is &s;incerely wi&s;hed you by, dear Sir,</P>

 The Rambler has increa&s;ed in fame as in age. Soon after its fir&s;t folio edition was concluded, it was publi&s;hed in four octavo volumes; and its authour lived to &s;ee ten numerous editions of it in London, be&s;ide tho&s;e of Ireland and Scotland.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s my&s;elf to have ever entertained a profound veneration for the a&s;toni&s;hing force and vivacity of mind, which the Rambler exhibits.

But men of reflection will be &s;en&s;ible that he has given a true repre&s;entation of human exi&s;tence, and that he has, at the &s;ame time, with a generous benevolence, di&s;played every con&s;olation which our &s;tate affords us; not only tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the hopes of futurity, but &s;uch as may be attained in the immediate progre&s;s through life. He has not depre&s;&s;ed the &s;oul to de&s;pondency and indifference. He has every where inculcated &s;tudy, labour, and exertion. Nay, he has &s;hewn, in a very odious light, a man who&s;e practice is to go about darkening the views of others, by perpetual complaints of evil, and awakening tho&s;e con&s;iderations of danger and di&s;tre&s;s, which are, for the mo&s;t part, lulled into a quiet oblivion. This he has done very &s;trongly in his character of Su&s;pirius <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">No. 55.</NOTE>, from which Gold&s;mith took that of Croaker, in his comedy of <Q REND="inline">"The Good-natured Man,"</Q> as John&s;on told me he acknowledged to him, and which is, indeed, very obvious.</P>

Some of the&s;e more &s;olemn papers, I doubt not, particularly attracted the notice of Dr. Young, the authour of <Q REND="inline">"The Night Thoughts,"</Q> of whom my e&s;timation is &s;uch, as to reckon his applau&s;e an honour even to John&s;on. I have &s;een &s;ome volumes of Dr. Young's copy of the Rambler, in which he has marked the pa&s;&s;ages which he thought particularly excellent, by folding down a corner of the page; and &s;uch as he rated in a &s;uper-eminent degree, are marked by double folds. I am &s;orry that &s;ome of the volumes are lo&s;t. John&s;on was plea&s;ed when told of the minute attention with which Young had &s;ignified his approbation of his E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>I will venture to &s;ay, that in no writings whatever can be found more <HI>bark and &s;teel for the mind,</HI> if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion; more that can brace and invigorate every manly and noble &s;entiment. No. 32 on patience, even under extreme mi&s;ery, is wonderfully lofty, and as much above the rant of &s;toici&s;m, as the Sun of Revelation is brighter than the twilight of Pagan phi|lo&s;ophy. I never read the following &s;entence without feeling my frame thrill: <Q REND="inline">"I think there is &s;ome rea&s;on for que&s;tioning whether the body and mind are not &s;o proportioned, that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other; whether virtue cannot &s;tand its ground as long as life, and whether a &s;oul well principled will not be &s;ooner &s;eparated than &s;ubdued."</Q></P>
<P>Though in&s;truction be the predominant purpo&s;e of the Rambler, yet it is enlivened with a con&s;iderable portion of amu&s;ement. Nothing can be more erroneous than the notion which &s;ome per&s;ons have entertained, that John&s;on was then a retired authour, ignorant of the world; and, of con&s;equence, that he wrote only from his imagination when he de&s;cribed characters and manners. He &s;aid to me, that before he wrote that work, he had been <Q REND="inline">"running about the world,"</Q> as he expre&s;&s;ed it, more than almo&s;t any body; and I have heard him relate, with much &s;atisfaction, that &s;everal of the characters in the Rambler were drawn &s;o naturally, that when it fir&s;t circulated in numbers, a club in one of the towns in E&s;&s;ex imagined them&s;elves to be &s;everally exhibited in it, and were much incen&s;ed again&s;t a per&s;on who, they &s;u&s;pected, had thus
<PB N="118" REF="149" MS="y">
 made them objects of publick notice; nor were they quieted till authenticl a&s;&s;urance was given them, that the Rambler was written by a per&s;on who had never heard of any one of them. Some of the characters are believed to hav been actually drawn from the life, particularly that of Pro&s;pero from Garrick who never entirely forgave its pointed &s;atire. For in&s;tances of fertility of fancy, and accurate de&s;cription of real life, I appeal to No. 19, a man who wanders from one profe&s;&s;ion to another, with mo&s;t plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for every change. No. 34, female fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s and timorous refinement. No. 82, Virtuo&s;o who has collected curio&s;ities. No. 88, petty modes of entertaining company, and conciliating kindne&s;s. No. 182, fortune-hunting. No. 194&mdash;195 a tutor's account of the follies of his pupil. No. 197&mdash;198, legacy-hunting He has given a &s;pecimen of his nice ob&s;ervation of the mere external appear|ances of life, in this pa&s;&s;age in No. 179, again&s;t affectation, that frequent and mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting quality: <Q REND="inline">"He that &s;tands to contemplate the crouds that fil the &s;treets of a populous city, will &s;ee many pa&s;&s;engers who&s;e air and motion it will be difficult to behold without contempt and laughter; but if he examine what are the appearances that thus powerfully excite his ri&s;ibility, he will find among them neither poverty nor di&s;ea&s;e, nor any involuntary or painful defect The di&s;po&s;ition to deri&s;ion and in&s;ult, is awakened by the &s;oftne&s;s of foppery the &s;well of in&s;olence, the liveline&s;s of levity, or the &s;olemnity of grandeur by the &s;prightly trip, the &s;tately &s;talk, the formal &s;trut, and the lofty mien by ge&s;tures intended to catch the eye, and by looks elaborately formed a evidences of importance."</Q></P>
<P>Every page of the Rambler &s;hews a mind teeming with cla&s;&s;ical allu&s;ion and poetical imagery: illu&s;trations from other writers are, upon all occa&s;ions &s;o ready, and mingle &s;o ea&s;ily in his periods, that the whole appears of one uniform vivid texture.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of this work has been cen&s;ured by &s;ome &s;hallow criticks as involved and turgid, and abounding with antiquated and hard words. So ill founded is the fir&s;t part of this objection, that I will challenge all who may honour this book with a peru&s;al, to point out any Engli&s;h writer who&s;e lan|guage conveys his meaning with equal force and per&s;picuity. It mu&s;t, in|deed, be allowed, that the &s;tructure of his &s;entences is expanded, and often has &s;omewhat of the inver&s;ion of Latin; and that he delighted to ex|pre&s;s familiar thoughts in philo&s;ophical language; being in this the rever&s;e of Socrates, who, it was &s;aid, reduced philo&s;ophy to the &s;implicity of common life. But let us attend to what he him&s;elf &s;ays in his concluding paper: <Q REND="inline">"When common words were le&s;s plea&s;ing to the ear, or le&s;s di&s;tinct in their
<PB N="119" REF="150" MS="y">
&s;ignification, I have familiari&s;ed the terms of philo&s;ophy, by applying them to  popular ideas <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Yet his &s;tyle did not e&s;cape the harmle&s;s &s;hafts of plea&s;ant humour; for the ingenious Bonnell Thornton publi&s;hed a mock Rambler in the Drury-lane Journal.</NOTE>."</Q> And, as to the &s;econd part of this objection, upon a late careful revi&s;ion of the work, I can with confidence &s;ay, that it is amazing how few of tho&s;e words, for which it has been unju&s;tly characteri&s;ed, are actually to be found in it; I am &s;ure, not the proportion of one to each paper. This idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another, who have confounded John&s;on's E&s;&s;ays with John&s;on's Dictionary; and becau&s;e he thought it right in a Lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into di&s;u&s;e, but were &s;upported by great authorities, it has been imagined that all of the&s;e have been interwoven into his own compo&s;itions. That &s;ome of them have been adopted by him unnece&s;&s;arily, may, perhaps, be allowed; but, in general they are evidently an advantage, for without them his &s;tately ideas would be confined and cramped. <Q REND="inline">"He that thinks with more extent than another, will want words of larger meaning <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Idler, No. 70.</NOTE>."</Q> He once told me, that he had formed his &s;tyle upon that of Sir William Temple, and upon Chambers's Propo&s;al for his Dictionary. He certainly was mi&s;taken; or if he imagined at fir&s;t that he was imitating Temple, he was very un&s;ucce&s;sful; for nothing can be more unlike than the &s;implicity of Temple, and the richne&s;s of John&s;on. Their &s;tyles differ as plain cloth and brocade. Temple, indeed, &s;eems equally erroneous in &s;uppo&s;ing that he him&s;elf had formed his &s;tyle upon Sandys's Hi&s;tory of all Religions.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of John&s;on was, undoubtedly, much formed upon that of the great writers in the la&s;t century, Hooker, Bacon, Sander&s;on, Hakewell, and others; tho&s;e <Q REND="inline">"GIANTS,"</Q> as they were well characteri&s;ed by one who&s;e authority, were I to name him, would &s;tamp a reverence on the opinion.</P>
<P>We may, with the utmo&s;t propriety, apply to his learned &s;tyle that pa&s;&s;age of Horace, a part of which he has taken as the motto to his Dictionary:</P>
<Q><LG>

</LG></Q>
<P>To &s;o great a ma&s;ter of thinking, to one of &s;uch va&s;t and various know|ledge as John&s;on, might have been allowed a liberal indulgence of that licence which Horace claims in another place:</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>Yet John&s;on a&s;&s;ured me, that he had not taken upon him to add more than four or five words to the Engli&s;h language, of his own formation; and he was very much offended at the general licence by no means <Q REND="inline">"mode&s;tly taken"</Q> in his time, not only to coin new words, but to u&s;e many words in &s;en&s;es quite different from their e&s;tabli&s;hed meaning, and tho&s;e frequently very fanta&s;tical.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Brown, who&s;e life John&s;on wrote, was remarkably fond of Anglo-Latian diction; and to his example we are to a&s;cribe John&s;on's &s;ome|times indulging him&s;elf in this kind of phra&s;eology <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">The ob&s;ervation of his having imitated Sir Thomas Brown has been made by many people; and lately it has been in&s;i&s;ted on and illu&s;trated by a variety of quotations from Brown in one of the popular E&s;&s;ays written by the Reverend Mr. Knox, ma&s;ter of Tunbridge &s;chool, whom I have &s;et down in my li&s;t of tho&s;e who have &s;ometimes not un&s;ucce&s;sfully imitated Dr. John&s;on's &s;tyle.</NOTE>. John&s;on's comprehen&s;ion
<PB N="121" REF="152" MS="y">
of mind was the mould for his language. Had his conceptions been nar|rower,  his expre&s;&s;ion would have been ea&s;ier. His &s;entences have a dignified march; and, it is certain, that his example has given a general elevation to the language of his country, for many of our be&s;t writers have approached very near to him; and, from the influence which he has had upon our compo|&s;ition, &s;carcely any thing is written now that is not better expre&s;&s;ed than was u&s;ual before he appeared to lead the national ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, the truth of which mu&s;t &s;trike every critical reader, has been &s;o happily enforced by Mr. Courtenay, in his <Q REND="inline">"Moral and Literary Character of Dr. John&s;on,"</Q> that I cannot prevail on my&s;elf to withhold it, notwith&s;tanding his, perhaps, too great partiality for one of his friends:</P>

<P>John&s;on's language, however, mu&s;t be allowed to be too ma&s;culine for the delicate gentlene&s;s of female writing. His ladies, therefore, &s;eem &s;trangely formal, even to ridicule; and &s;eem well denominated by the names which he has given them, as, Mi&s;ella, Zozima, Properantia, Rhodoclia.</P>
<P>It has of late been the fa&s;hion to compare the &s;tyle of Addi&s;on and John&s;on, and to depreciate, I think very unju&s;tly, the &s;tyle of Addi&s;on as nervele&s;s and feeble, becau&s;e it has not the &s;trength and energy of that of John&s;on. Their pro&s;e may be balanced like the poetry of Dryden and Pope. Both are excellent, though in different ways. Addi&s;on writes with the ea&s;e of a gen|tleman. His readers fancy that a wi&s;e and accompli&s;hed companion is talking to them, &s;o that he in&s;inuates his &s;entiments and ta&s;te into their minds by an imperceptible influence. John&s;on writes like a teacher. He dictates to his readers as if from an academical chair. They attend with awe and admi|ration; and his precepts are impre&s;&s;ed upon them by his commanding
<PB N="123" REF="154" MS="y">
eloquence. Addi&s;on's &s;tyle, like a light wine, plea&s;es every body from the  fir&s;t. John&s;on's, like a liquor of more body, &s;eems too &s;trong at fir&s;t, but, by degrees, is highly reli&s;hed; and &s;uch is the melody of his periods, &s;o much do they captivate the ear, and &s;eize upon the attention, that there is &s;carcely any writer, however incon&s;iderable, who does not aim, in &s;ome degree, at the &s;ame &s;pecies of excellence. But let us not ungratefully undervalue that beautiful &s;tyle, which has plea&s;ingly conveyed to us much in&s;truction and entertainment. Though comparatively weak, when oppo&s;ed to John&s;on's Herculean vigour, let us not call it po&s;itively feeble. Let us remember the character of his &s;tyle, as given by John&s;on him&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">"What he attempted, he performed; he is <HI>never feeble,</HI> and he did not wi&s;h to be energetick; he is never rapid, and he never &s;tagnates.

<P>Though the Rambler was not concluded till the year 1752, I &s;hall, under this year, &s;ay all that I have to ob&s;erve upon it. Some of the tran&s;lations of the mottos by him&s;elf, are admirably done. He acknowledges to have received <Q REND="inline">"elegant tran&s;lations"</Q> of many of them from Mr. James Elphin&s;ton&punc; and &s;ome are very happily tran&s;lated by a Mr. <HI>F.

I cannot, however, but wi&s;h, that he had not ended it with an unnece&s;&s;ary Greek ver&s;e, tran&s;lated al&s;o into an Engli&s;h couplet. It is too much like the conceit of tho&s;e drama|tick poets, who u&s;ed to conclude each act with a rhyme; and the expre&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t line of his couplet, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Cele&s;tial powers,"</HI></Q> though proper in Pagan poetry, is ill &s;uited to Chri&s;tianity, with a conformity to which he con&s;oles him&s;elf.

<P>His ju&s;t abhorrence of Milton's political notions was ever &s;trong. But this did not prevent his warm admiration of Milton's great poetical merit, to which he has done illu&s;trious ju&s;tice, beyond all who have written upon the &s;ubject. And this year he not only wrote a Prologue, which was &s;poken by Mr. Garrick before the acting of Comus at Drury-lane theatre, for the benefit of Milton's grand-daughter, but took a very zealous intere&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;s of the charity. On the day preceding the performance, he publi&s;hed the following letter in the <Q REND="inline">"General Adverti&s;er,"</Q> addre&s;&s;ed to the printer of that paper:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT a certain degree of reputation is acquired merely by approving the works of genius, and te&s;tifying a regard to the memory of authours, is a truth too evident to be be denied; and therefore to en&s;ure a participation of fame with a celebrated poet, many who would, perhaps, have contributed to &s;tarve him when alive, have heaped expen&s;ive pageants upon his grave.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, that this method of becoming known to po&s;terity with honour is peculiar to the great, or at lea&s;t to the wealthy; but an opportunity now offers for almo&s;t every individual to &s;ecure the prai&s;e of paying a ju&s;t regard to the illu&s;trious dead, united with the plea&s;ure of doing good to the living. To a&s;&s;i&s;t illu&s;trious indigence, &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s and debilitated by age, is a di&s;play of virtue, and an acqui&s;ition of happine&s;s and honour.</P>

<P>This extraordinary attempt of Lauder was no &s;udden effort. He had brooded over it for many years; and to this hour it is uncertain what his principal motive was, unle&s;s it were a vain notion of his &s;uperiority, in being able, by whatever means, to deceive mankind. To effect this, he produced certain pa&s;&s;ages from Grotius, Ma&s;enius, and others, which had a faint re&s;em|blance to &s;ome parts of the <Q REND="inline">"Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t."</Q> In the&s;e he interpolated &s;ome
<PB N="126" REF="157">
<MILESTONE N="1751. Aetat. 42."> fragments of Hog's Latin tran&s;lation of that poem, alledging that the ma&s;s thus fabricated was the archetype from which Milton copied. The&s;e fabrications he publi&s;hed from time to time in the Gentleman's Magazine; and, exulting in his fancied &s;ucce&s;s, he in 1750 ventured to collect them into a pamphlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">"An E&s;&s;ay on Milton's U&s;e and Imitation of the Moderns in his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t."</Q> To this pamphlet John&s;on wrote a Preface, in full per&s;ua&s;ion of Lauder's hone&s;ty, and a Po&s;t&s;cript recommending, in the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive terms, a &s;ub&s;cription for the relief of a grand-daughter of Milton, of whom he thus &s;peaks: <Q REND="inline">"It is yet in the power of a great people to reward the poet who&s;e name they boa&s;t, and from their alliance to who&s;e genius, they claim &s;ome kind of &s;uperiority to every other nation of the earth; that poet, who&s;e works may po&s;&s;ibly be read when every other monu|ment of Briti&s;h greatne&s;s &s;hall be obliterated; to reward him, not with pictures or with medals, which, if he &s;ees, he &s;ees with contempt, but with tokens of gratitude, which he, perhaps, may even now con&s;ider as not un|worthy the regard of an immortal &s;pirit."</Q> Surely this is incon&s;i&s;tent with <Q REND="inline">"enmity towards Milton,"</Q> which Sir John Hawkins imputes to John&s;on upon this occa&s;ion, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I could all along ob&s;erve that John&s;on &s;eemed to approve not only of the de&s;ign, but of the argument; and &s;eemed to exult in a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the reputation of Milton was likely to &s;uffer by this di&s;covery. That he was not privy to the impo&s;ture, I am well per|&s;uaded; but that he wi&s;hed well to the argument, may be inferred from the Preface, which indubitably was written by John&s;on."</Q> Is it po&s;&s;ible for any man of clear judgement to &s;uppo&s;e that John&s;on, who &s;o nobly prai&s;ed the poetical excellence of Milton in a Po&s;t&s;cript to this very <Q REND="inline">"di&s;covery,"</Q> as he then &s;uppo&s;ed it, could, at the &s;ame time, exult in a per&s;ua&s;ion that the great poet's reputation was likely to &s;uffer by it? This is an incon&s;i&s;tency of which John&s;on was incapable; nor can any thing more be fairly inferred from the Preface, than that John&s;on, who was alike di&s;tingui&s;hed for ardent curio&s;ity and love of truth, was plea&s;ed with an inve&s;tigation by which both were grati|fied. That he was actuated by the&s;e motives, and certainly by no unworthy de&s;ire to depreciate our great epick poet, is evident from his own words; for, after mentioning the general zeal of men of genius and literature <Q REND="inline">"to advance the honour, and di&s;tingui&s;h the beauties of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,"</Q> he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Among the inquiries to which this ardour of critici&s;m has naturally given occa&s;ion, none is more ob&s;cure in it&s;elf, or more worthy of rational curio&s;ity, than a retro&s;pection of the progre&s;s of this mighty genius in the con&s;truction of his work; a view of the fabrick gradually ri&s;ing, perhaps, from &s;mall beginnings,

<P>Though John&s;on's circum&s;tances were at this time far from being ea&s;y, his humane and charitable di&s;po&s;ition was con&s;tantly exerting it&s;elf. Mrs. Anna Williams, daughter of a very ingenious Wel&s;h phy&s;ician, and a woman of more than ordinary talents and literature, having come to London in hopes of being cured of a cataract in both her eyes, which afterwards ended in total blindne&s;s, was kindly received as a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at his hou&s;e while Mrs. John&s;on lived; and after her death having come under his roof in order to have an operation upon her eyes performed with more comfort to her than in lodgings, &s;he had an apartment from him during the re&s;t of her life, at all times when he had a hou&s;e.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1752"> In 1752 he was almo&s;t entirely occupied with his Dictionary. The la&s;t paper of his Rambler was publi&s;hed March 2, this year; after which, there was a ce&s;&s;ation for &s;ome time of any exertion of his talents as an e&s;&s;ayi&s;t. But, in the &s;ame year, Dr. Hawke&s;worth, who was his warm admirer, and a &s;tudious imitator of his &s;tyle, and then lived in great intimacy with him, began a periodical paper, entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE ADVENTURER,"</Q> in connection with other gentlemen, one of whom was John&s;on's much-loved friend, Dr. Bathur&s;t; and, without doubt, they received many valuable hints from his conver&s;ation, mo&s;t of his friends having been &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the cour&s;e of their works.</P>

To argue from her being much older than John&s;on, or any other circum&s;tances, that he could not really love her, is ab&s;urd; for love is not a &s;ubject of rea&s;oning, but of &s;eeling, and therefore there are no common principles upon which one can per&s;uade another con|cerning

<P>That his love for her was of the mo&s;t ardent kind, and, during the long period of fifty years, was unimpaired by the lap&s;e of time, is evident from various pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;eries of his Prayers and Meditations, publi&s;hed by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, as well as from other memorials, one of which I &s;elect, as &s;trongly marking the tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of his mind.</P>

I have, indeed, been told by Mrs. De&s;moulins, who, before her marriage,  lived for &s;ome time with Mrs. John&s;on at Hamp&s;tead, that &s;he indulged her|&s;elf in country air and nice living, at an un&s;uitable expence, while her hu&s;band was drudging in the &s;moke of London, and that &s;he by no means treated him with that complacency which is the mo&s;t engaging quality in a wife. But all this is perfectly compatible with his fondne&s;s for her, e&s;pecially when it is remembered that he had a high opinion of her under&s;tanding, and that the impre&s;&s;ion which her beauty, real or imaginary, had originally made upon his fancy, being continued by habit, had not been effaced, though &s;he her&s;elf was doubtle&s;s much altered for the wor&s;e. The dreadful &s;hock of &s;eparation took place in the night; and he immediately di&s;patched a letter to his friend, the Reverend Dr. Taylor, which, as Taylor told me, expre&s;&s;ed grief in the &s;tronge&s;t manner he had ever read; &s;o that it is much to be regretted it has not been pre&s;erved. The letter was brought to Dr. Taylor, at his hou&s;e in the Cloy&s;ters, We&s;tmin&s;ter, about three in the morning; and as it &s;ignified an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee him, he got up, and went to John&s;on as &s;oon as he was dre&s;&s;ed, and found him in tears and in extreme agitation. After being a little while together, John&s;on reque&s;ted him to join with him in prayer. He then prayed extempore, as did Dr. Taylor; and thus, by means of that piety which was ever his primary object, his troubled mind was, in &s;ome degree, &s;oothed and compo&s;ed.</P>

 Francis Barber, his faithful negro &s;ervant <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Francis Barber was born in Jamaica, and was brought to England in 1750 by Colonel Bathur&s;t, father of John&s;on's very intimate friend, Dr. Bathur&s;t. He was &s;ent, for &s;ome time, to the Reverend Mr. Jack&s;on's &s;chool, at Barton in York&s;hire. The Colonel by his will left him his freedom, and Dr. Bathur&s;t was willing that he &s;hould enter into John&s;on's &s;ervice, in which he con|tinued from 1752 till John&s;on's death, with the exception of two intervals; in one of which, upon &s;ome difference with his ma&s;ter, he went and &s;erved an apothecary in Cheap&s;ide, but &s;till vi&s;ited Dr. John&s;on occa&s;ionally; in another, when he took a fancy to go to &s;ea. Part of the time, indeed, he was, by the kindne&s;s of his ma&s;ter, at a &s;chool in Northampton&s;hire, that he might have the advantage of &s;ome learning. So early and &s;o la&s;ting a connection was there between Dr. John&s;on and this humble friend.</NOTE>, who came into his family about a fortnight after the di&s;mal event. The&s;e &s;ufferings were aggravated by the melancholy inherent in his con&s;titution; and although he probably was not oftener in the wrong than &s;he was, in the little di&s;agreements which &s;ometimes troubled his married &s;tate, during which, he owned to me, that the gloomy irri|tability of his exi&s;tence was more painful to him than ever, he might very natu|rally, after her death, be tenderly di&s;po&s;ed to charge him&s;elf with &s;light omi&s;&s;ions and offences, the &s;en&s;e of which would give him much unea&s;ine&s;s. Accord|ingly we find, about a year after her decea&s;e, that he thus addre&s;&s;ed the Supreme Being: <Q REND="inline">"O LORD, who give&s;t the grace of repentance, and heare&s;t the prayers of the penitent, grant that by true contrition I may obtain forgive|ne&s;s of all the &s;ins committed, and of all duties neglected in my union with the wife whom thou ha&s;t taken from me; for the neglect of joint devotion, patient exhortation, and mild in&s;truction <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 19.</NOTE>."</Q> The kindne&s;s of his heart, not|with&s;tanding the impetuo&s;ity of his temper, is well known to his friends; and I cannot trace the &s;malle&s;t foundation for the following dark and uncharitable a&s;&s;ertion by Sir John Hawkins: <Q REND="inline">"The apparition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrifick kind, and hardly afforded him a hope that &s;he was in a &s;tate of happine&s;s <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Hawkins's Life of John&s;on, p. 316.</NOTE>."</Q> That he, in conformity with the opinion of many of the mo&s;t able, learned, and pious Chri&s;tians in all ages, &s;uppo&s;ed that there was a middle &s;tate after death, previous to the time at which departed &s;ouls are finally received to eternal felicity, appears, I think, unque&s;tionably from his devotions: <Q REND="inline">"And, O LORD, &s;o far as it may be lawful in me, I commend to thy fatherly goodne&s;s <HI>the &s;oul of my departed wife;</HI> be&s;eeching thee to <HI>grant</HI> her whatever is be&s;t in her <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate,</HI> and <HI>finally to receive her to eternal hap|pine&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 20.</NOTE>."</Q> But this &s;tate has not been looked upon with horrour, but only as le&s;s gracious.</P>

He depo&s;ited the remains of Mrs. John&s;on in the church of Bromley in  Kent, to which he was probably led by the re&s;idence of his friend Hawke&s;worth at that place. The funeral &s;ermon which he compo&s;ed for her, which was never preached, but having been given to Dr. Taylor, has been publi&s;hed &s;ince his death, is a performance of uncommon excellence, and full of rational and pious comfort to &s;uch as are depre&s;&s;ed by that &s;evere affliction which John&s;on felt when he wrote it. When it is con&s;idered that it was written in &s;uch an agitation of mind, and in the &s;hort interval between her death and burial, it cannot be read without wonder.</P>
<P>From Mr. Francis Barber I have had the following authentick and artle&s;s account of the &s;ituation in which he found him recently after his wife's death: <Q>He was in great affliction. Mrs. Williams was then living in his hou&s;e, which was in Gough-&s;quare. He was bu&s;y with the Dictionary. Mr. Shiels, and &s;ome others of the gentlemen who had formerly written for him, u&s;ed to come about him. He had then little for him&s;elf, but fre|quently &s;ent money to Mr. Shiels when in di&s;tre&s;s. The friends who vi&s;ited him at that time, were chiefly Dr. Bathur&s;t, and Mr. Diamond, an apothecary in Cork-&s;treet, Burlington-gardens, with whom he and Mrs. Williams generally dined every Sunday. There was a talk of his going to Iceland with him, which would probably have happened had he lived. There were al&s;o Mr. Cave, Dr. Hawke&s;worth, Mr. Ryland, merchant on Tower-hill, Mrs. Ma&s;ters the poete&s;s, who lived with Mr. Cave, Mrs. Carter, and &s;ometimes Mrs. Macaulay; al&s;o, Mrs. Gardiner, wife of a tallow-chandler on Snow-hill, not in the learned way, but a worthy good woman; Mr. (now Sir Jo&s;hua) Reynolds; Mr. Millar, Mr. Dod&s;ley, Mr. Bouquet, Mr. Payne of Paterno&s;ter-row, book&s;ellers; Mr. Strahan the printer, the Earl of Orrery, Lord Southwell, Mr. Garrick.</Q></P>
<P>Many are, no doubt, omitted in this catalogue of his friends, and, in par|ticular, his humble friend Mr. Robert Levet, an ob&s;cure practi&s;er in phy&s;ick among&s;t the lower people, his fees being &s;ometimes very &s;mall &s;ums, &s;ome|times whatever provi&s;ions his patients could afford him, but of &s;uch exten&s;ive practice in that way, that Mrs. Williams has told me, his walk was from Hound&s;ditch to Marybone. It appears from John&s;on's diary, that their acquaintance commenced about the year 1746; and &s;uch was John&s;on's predi|lection for him, and fanciful e&s;timation of his moderate abilities, that I have heard him &s;ay he &s;hould not be &s;atisfied, though attended by all the College of Phy&s;icians, unle&s;s he had Mr. Levet with him. Ever &s;ince I was acquainted with Dr. John&s;on, and many years before, as I have been a&s;&s;ured by tho&s;e who knew him earlier, Mr. Levet had an apartment in his hou&s;e, or his chambers,
<PB N="132" REF="163" MS="y">
 and waited upon him every morning, through the whole cour&s;e of his late and tedious breakfa&s;t. He was of a &s;trange grote&s;que appearance, &s;tiff and formal in his manner, and &s;eldom &s;aid a word while any company was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The circle of his friends, indeed, at this time was exten&s;ive and various, far beyond what has been generally imagined. To trace his acquaintance with each particular per&s;on, if it could be done, would be a ta&s;k, of which the labour would not be repaid by the advantage. But exceptions are to be made; one of which mu&s;t be a friend &s;o eminent as Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who was truly his <HI>dulce decus,</HI> and with whom he maintained an uninterrupted intimacy to the la&s;t hour of his life. When John&s;on lived in Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, he u&s;ed frequently to vi&s;it two ladies, who lived oppo&s;ite to him, Mi&s;s Cotterells, daughters of Admiral Cotterell. Reynolds u&s;ed al&s;o to vi&s;it there, and thus they met. Mr. Reynolds, as I have ob&s;erved above, had, from the fir&s;t reading of his Life of Savage, conceived a very high admiration of John&s;on's powers of writing. His conver&s;ation no le&s;s delighted him; and he cultivated his acquaintance with the laudable zeal of one who was am|bitious of general improvement. Sir Jo&s;hua, indeed, was lucky enough at their very fir&s;t meeting to make a remark, which was &s;o much above the common-place &s;tyle of conver&s;ation, that John&s;on at once perceived that Reynolds had the habit of thinking for him&s;elf. The ladies were regretting the death of a friend, to whom they owed great obligations; upon which Reynolds ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"You have, however, the comfort of being relieved from a burthen of gratitude."</Q> They were &s;hocked a little at this alleviating &s;ugge&s;tion, as too &s;elfi&s;h; but John&s;on defended it in his clear and forcible manner, and was much plea&s;ed with the <HI>mind,</HI> the fair view of human nature, which it exhibited, like &s;ome of the reflections of Rochefaucault. The con&s;equence was, that he went home with Reynolds, and &s;upped with him.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua has told me a plea&s;ant characteri&s;tical anecdote of John&s;on about the time of their fir&s;t acquaintance. When they were one evening together at the Mi&s;s Cotterells, the then Duche&s;s of Argyle and another lady of high rank came in. John&s;on thinking that the Mi&s;s Cotterells were too much engro&s;&s;ed by them, and that he and his friend were neglected, as low com|pany of whom they were &s;omewhat a&s;hamed, grew angry; and re&s;olving to &s;hock their &s;uppo&s;ed pride, by making their great vi&s;iters imagine that his friend and he were low indeed, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a loud tone to Mr. Reynolds, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"How much do you think you and I could get in a week, if we were to <HI>work as hard</HI> as we could?"</Q> as if they had been common mechanicks.</P>

His acquaintance with Bennet Langton, E&s;q. of Langton, in Lincoln&s;hire, another much valued friend, commenced &s;oon after the conclu&s;ion of his Rambler, which that gentleman, then a youth, had read with &s;o much admi|ration, that he came to London chiefly with the view of endeavouring to be introduced to its authour. By a fortunate chance he happened to take lodgings in a hou&s;e where Mr. Levet frequently vi&s;ited; and having mentioned his wi&s;h to his landlady, &s;he introduced him to Mr. Levet, who readily obtained John&s;on's permi&s;&s;ion to bring Mr. Langton to him; as, indeed, John&s;on, during the whole cour&s;e of his life, had no &s;hyne&s;s, real or affected, but was ea&s;y of acce&s;s to all who were properly recommended, and even wi&s;hed to &s;ee numbers at his <HI>levee,</HI> as his morning circle of company might, with &s;trict propriety, be called. Mr. Langton was exceedingly &s;urprized when the &s;age fir&s;t appeared. He had not received the &s;malle&s;t intimation of his figure, dre&s;s, or manner. From peru&s;ing his writings, he fancied he &s;hould &s;ee a decent, well-dre&s;t, in &s;hort, a remarkably decorous philo&s;opher. In&s;tead of which, down from his bed-chamber, about noon, came, as newly ri&s;en, a huge uncouth figure, with a little dark wig which &s;carcely covered his head, and his clothes hanging loo&s;e about him. But his conver&s;ation was &s;o rich, &s;o animated, and &s;o forcible, and his religious and political notions &s;o con|genial with tho&s;e in which Mr. Langton had been educated, that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which he ever pre&s;erved. John&s;on was not the le&s;s ready to love Mr. Langton, for his being of a very ancient family; for I have heard him &s;ay, with plea&s;ure, <Q REND="inline">"Langton, Sir, has a grant of a warren from Henry the Second; and Cardinal Stephen Langton, in King John's reign, was of this family."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Langton afterwards went to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies at Trinity College, Oxford, where he formed an acquaintance with his fellow-&s;tudent, Mr. Topham Beauclerk, who, though their opinions and modes of life were &s;o different, that it &s;eemed utterly improbable that they &s;hould at all agree, had &s;o ardent a love of literature, &s;o acute an under&s;tanding, &s;uch elegance of manners, and &s;o well di&s;cerned the excellent qualities of Mr. Langton, that they became intimate friends.</P>
<P>John&s;on, &s;oon after this acquaintance began, pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time at Oxford. He at fir&s;t thought it &s;trange that Langton &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate &s;o much with one who had the character of being loo&s;e, both in his principles and practice; but, by degrees, he him&s;elf was fa&s;cinated. Mr. Beauclerk's being of the St. Albans' family, and having, in &s;ome particulars, a re&s;emblance to Charles the Second, contributed, in John&s;on's imagination, to throw a lu&s;tre
<PB N="134" REF="165" MS="y">
 upon his other qualities; and, in a &s;hort time, the moral, pious John&s;on, and the gay, di&s;&s;ipated Beauclerk, were companions. <Q REND="inline">"What a coalition! (&s;aid Garrick, when he heard of this;) I &s;hall have my old friend to bail out of the Round-hou&s;e."</Q> But I can bear te&s;timony that it was a very agreeable a&s;&s;o|ciation. Beauclerk was too polite, and valued learning and wit too much, to offend John&s;on by &s;allies of infidelity or licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and John&s;on delighted in the good qualities of Beauclerk, and hoped to correct the evil. Innu|merable were the &s;cenes in which John&s;on was amu&s;ed by the&s;e young men. Beauclerk could take more liberty with him, than any body with whom I ever &s;aw him; but, on the other hand, Beauclerk was not &s;pared by his re&s;pectable companion, when reproof was proper. Beauclerk had &s;uch a propen&s;ity to &s;atire, that at one time John&s;on &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"You never open your mouth but with intention to give pain; and you have often given me pain, not from the power of what you &s;aid, but from &s;eeing your intention."</Q> At another time applying to him, with a &s;light alteration, a line of Pope, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Thy love of folly, and thy &s;corn of fools&mdash;Every thing thou do&s;t &s;hews the one, and every thing thou &s;ay'&s;t the other."</Q> At another time he &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Thy body is all vice, and thy mind all virtue."</Q> Beauclerk not &s;eeming to reli&s;h the compliment, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, Alexander the Great, marching in triumph into Babylon, could not have de&s;ired to have had more &s;aid to him."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was &s;ome time with Beauclerk at his hou&s;e at Wind&s;or, where he was entertained with experiments in natural philo&s;ophy. One Sunday, when the weather was very fine, Beauclerk enticed him, in&s;en&s;ibly, to &s;aunter about all the morning. They went into a church-yard, in the time of divine &s;ervice, and John&s;on laid him&s;elf down at his ea&s;e upon one of the tomb-&s;tones. <Q REND="inline">"Now, Sir, (&s;aid Beauclerk) you are like Hogarth's Idle Apprentice."</Q> When John&s;on got his pen&s;ion, Beauclerk &s;aid to him, in the humorous phra&s;e of Fal&s;taff, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you'll now purge, and live cleanly like a gentleman."</Q></P>
<P>One night when Beauclerk and Langton had &s;upped at a tavern in London, and &s;at till about three in the morning, it came into their heads to go and knock up John&s;on, and &s;ee if they could prevail on him to join them in a ramble. They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple, till at la&s;t he appeared in his &s;hirt, with his little black wig on the top of his head, in&s;tead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand, imagining, probably, that &s;ome ruffians were coming to attack him. When he di&s;covered who they were, and was told their errand, he &s;miled, and with great good humour agreed to their propo&s;al: <Q REND="inline">"What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a fri&s;k with
<PB N="135" REF="166" MS="y">
you."</Q> He was &s;oon dre&s;t, and they &s;allied forth together into Covent-Garden, where the green-grocers and fruiterers were beginning to arrange their hampers, ju&s;t come in from the country. John&s;on made &s;ome attempts to help them; but the hone&s;t gardeners &s;tared &s;o at his figure and manner, and odd inter|ference, that he &s;oon &s;aw his &s;ervices were not reli&s;hed. They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns, and made a bowl of that liquor called <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> which John&s;on had always liked; while in joyous contempt of &s;leep, from which he had been rou&s;ed, he repeated the fe&s;tive lines,
<Q><L>"Short, O &s;hort then be thy reign,</L>
<L>"And gve us to the world again!"</L></Q></P>
<P>They did not &s;tay long, but walked down to the Thames, took a boat, and rowed to Billing&s;gate. Beauclerk and John&s;on were &s;o well plea&s;ed with their amu&s;ement, that they re&s;olved to per&s;evere in di&s;&s;ipation for the re&s;t of the day: but Langton de&s;erted them, being engaged to breakfa&s;t with &s;ome young ladies. John&s;on &s;colded him for <Q REND="inline">"leaving his &s;ocial friends, to go and &s;it with a &s;et of wretched <HI>un-idea'd</HI> girls."</Q> Garrick being told of this ramble, &s;aid to him &s;martly, <Q REND="inline">"I heard of your frolick t'other night. You'll be in the Chronicle."</Q> Upon which John&s;on afterwards ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"He</HI> dur&s;t not do &s;uch a thing. His <HI>wife</HI> would not <HI>let</HI> him!"</Q></P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1753"> He entered upon the year 1753 with his u&s;ual piety, as appears from the following prayer tran&s;cribed from that part of his diary which he burnt a few days before his death:</P>
<Q><P><DATE>Jan. 1, 1753, N. S.</DATE> which I &s;hall u&s;e for the future.</P>
<P>Almighty GOD, who ha&s;t continued my life to this day, grant that, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy Holy Spirit, I may improve the time which thou &s;halt grant me, to my eternal &s;alvation. Make me to remember, to thy glory, thy judgements and thy mercies. Make me &s;o to con&s;ider the lo&s;s of my wife, whom thou ha&s;t taken from me, that it may di&s;po&s;e me, by thy grace, to lead the re&s;idue of my life in thy fear. Grant this, O LORD, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake. Amen.</P></Q>
<P>He now relieved the drudgery of his Dictionary, and the melancholy of his grief, by taking an active part in the compo&s;ition of <Q REND="inline">"The Adventurer,"</Q> in which he began to write April 10, marking his e&s;&s;ays with the &s;ignature T, by which mo&s;t of his papers in that collection are di&s;tingui&s;hed: tho&s;e, how|ever, which have that &s;ignature and al&s;o that of <HI>My&s;argyrus,</HI> were not written by him, but, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by Dr. Bathur&s;t. Indeed John&s;on's energy of
<PB N="136" REF="167" MS="y">
<MILESTONE N="1753. Aetat. 44."> thought and richne&s;s of language, are &s;till more deci&s;ive marks than any &s;igna|ture. As a proof of this, my readers, I imagine, will not doubt that No. 39, on &s;leep, is his; for it not only has the general texture and colour of his &s;tyle, but the authours with whom he was peculiarly conver&s;ant are readily introduced in it in cur&s;ory allu&s;ion. The tran&s;lation of a pa&s;&s;age in Statius quoted in that paper, and marked C. B. is certainly the performance of Dr. Charles Bathur&s;t&punc; How much this amiable man actually contributed to <Q REND="inline">"The Adventurer,"</Q> can|not be known. Let me add, that Hawke&s;worth's imitations of John&s;on are &s;ometimes &s;o happy, that it is extremely difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them, with certainty, from the compo&s;itions of his great archetype. Hawke&s;worth was his clo&s;e&s;t imitator, a circum&s;tance of which that writer would once have been proud to be told; though, when he had become elated by having ri&s;en into &s;ome degree of con&s;equence, he, in a conver&s;ation with me, had the provoking effrontery to &s;ay he was not &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>John&s;on was truly zealous for the &s;ucce&s;s of <Q REND="inline">"The Adventurer;"</Q> and very &s;oon after his engaging in it, he wrote the following letter</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Reverend Dr. <HI>JOSEPH WARTON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have written to you before now, but I ought to do many things which I do not; nor can I, indeed, claim any merit from this letter; for being de&s;ired by the authours and proprietor of the Adventurer to look out for another hand, my thoughts nece&s;&s;arily fix'd upon you, who&s;e fund of literature will enable you to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, with very little interruption of your &s;tudies.</P>
<P>They de&s;ire you to engage to furni&s;h one paper a month, at two guineas a paper, which you may very readily perform. We have con&s;idered that a paper &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of pieces of imagination, pictures of life, and di&s;qui|&s;itions of literature. The part which depends on the imagination is very well &s;upplied, as you will find when you read the paper; for de&s;criptions of life, there is now a treaty almo&s;t made with an authour and an authore&s;s; and the province of critici&s;m and literature they are very de&s;irous to a&s;&s;ign to the commentator on Virgil.</P>
<P>I hope this propo&s;al will not be rejected, and that the next po&s;t will bring us your compliance. I &s;peak as one of the fraternity, though I have no part in the paper, beyond now and then a motto; but two of the writers

are my particular friends, and I hope the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a third united to  them, will not be denied to, dear Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The con&s;equence of this letter was, Dr. Warton's enriching the collection with &s;everal admirable e&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>John&s;on's &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"I have no part in the paper beyond now and then a motto,"</Q> may &s;eem incon&s;i&s;tent with his being the authour of the papers marked T. But he had, at this time, written only one number; and be&s;ides, even at any after period, he might have u&s;ed the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider|ing it as a point of honour not to own them; for Mrs. Williams told me, that <Q REND="inline">"as he had <HI>given</HI> tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays to Dr. Bathur&s;t, who &s;old them at two guineas each, he never would own them; nay, he u&s;ed to &s;ay he did not <HI>write</HI> them: but the fact was, that he <HI>dictated</HI> them, while Bathur&s;t wrote."</Q> I read to him Mrs. Williams's account; he &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>I am not quite &s;atisfied with the ca&s;ui&s;try by which the productions of one per&s;on are thus pa&s;&s;ed upon the world for the productions of another. I allow that not only knowledge, but powers and qualities of mind may be com|municated; but the actual effect of individual exertion never can be tran&s;|ferred, with truth, to any other than its own original cau&s;e. One per&s;on's child may be made the child of another per&s;on by adoption, as among the Romans, or by the ancient Jewi&s;h mode of a wife having children borne to her upon her knees, by her handmaid. But the&s;e were children in a different &s;en&s;e from that of nature. It was clearly under&s;tood that they were not of the blood of their nominal parents. So in literary children, an authour may give the profits and fame of his compo&s;ition to another man, but cannot make that other the real authour. A Highland gentleman, a younger branch of a family, once con&s;ulted me if he could not validly purcha&s;e the Chieftain&s;hip of his family, from the Chief who was willing to &s;ell it. I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to acquire, by purcha&s;e, a right to be a different per&s;on from what he really was; for that the right of Chieftain&s;hip attached to the blood of primo-geniture, and, therefore, was incapable of being transferred. I added, that though E&s;au &s;old his birth-right, or the advantages belonging to it, he &s;till remained the fir&s;t-born of his parents; and that whatever agreement a Chief might make with any of the clan, the Herald's Office could not admit of the metamorpho&s;is, or with any decency atte&s;t that the younger was the elder; but I did not convince the worthy gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="169" MS="y">
 John&s;on's papers in the Adventurer are very fimilar to tho&s;e of the Rambler; but being rather more varied in their &s;ubjects, and being mixed with e&s;&s;ays by other writers, upon topicks more generally attractive than even the mo&s;t elegant ethical di&s;cour&s;es, the &s;ale of the work, at fir&s;t, was more exten&s;ive. Without meaning, however, to depreciate the Adventurer, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that as the value of the Rambler came, in the progre&s;s of time, to be better known, it grew upon the publick e&s;timation, and that its &s;ale has far exceeded that of any other periodical papers &s;ince the reign of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>In one of the books of his diary I find the following entry:</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1754">
<P><MILESTONE N="1754"> In 1754 I can trace nothing publi&s;hed by him, except his numbers of the Adventurer, and <Q REND="inline">"The Life of Edward Cave,"</Q> in the Gentleman's Maga|zine for February. In biography there can be no que&s;tion that he excelled, beyond all who have attempted that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition; upon which, indeed, he &s;et the highe&s;t value. To the minute &s;election of characteri&s;tical circum&s;tances, for which the ancients were remarkable, he added a philo|&s;ophical re&s;earch, and the mo&s;t per&s;picuous and energetick language. Cave was certainly a man of e&s;timable qualities, and was eminently diligent and &s;ucce&s;sful in his own bu&s;ine&s;s, which, doubtle&s;s, entitled him to re&s;pect. But he was peculiarly fortunate in being recorded by John&s;on, who, of the narrow life of a printer and publi&s;her, without any digre&s;&s;ions or adventitious circum|&s;tances, has made an intere&s;ting and agreeable narrative.</P>
<P>The Dictionary, we may believe, afforded John&s;on full occupation this year. As it approached to its conclu&s;ion, he probably worked with redoubled vigour, as &s;eamen increa&s;e their exertion and alacrity when they have a near pro&s;pect of their haven.</P>
<P>Lord Che&s;terfield, to whom John&s;on had paid the high compliment of addre&s;&s;ing to his Lord&s;hip the Plan of his Dictionary, had behaved to him in &s;uch a manner as to excite his contempt and indignation. The world has been for many years amu&s;ed with a &s;tory confidently told, and as confidently repeated with additional circum&s;tances, that a &s;udden di&s;gu&s;t was taken by John&s;on upon occa&s;ion of his having been one day kept long in waiting in his Lord|&s;hip's
<PB N="139" REF="170" MS="y">
antechamber, for which the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned was, that he had company <MILESTONE N="1754. Aetat. 45."> with him; and that at la&s;t, when the door opened, out walked Colley Cibber; and that John&s;on was &s;o violently provoked when he found for whom he had been &s;o long excluded, that he went away in a pa&s;&s;ion, and never would return. I remember having mentioned this &s;tory to George Lord Lyttelton, who told me, he was very intimate with Lord Che&s;terfield; and holding it as a well|known truth, defended Lord Che&s;terfield, by &s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">"Cibber, who had been introduced familiarly by the back-&s;tairs, had probably not been there above ten minutes."</Q> It may &s;eem &s;trange even to entertain a doubt concern|ing a &s;tory &s;o long and &s;o widely current, and thus implicitly adopted, if not &s;anctified, by the authority which I have mentioned; but John&s;on him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured me, that there was not the lea&s;t foundation for it. He told me, that there never was any particular incident which produced a quarrel between Lord Che&s;terfield and him; but that his Lord&s;hip's continued neglect was the rea&s;on why he re&s;olved to have no connection with him. When the Dictionary was upon the eve of publication, Lord Che&s;terfield, who, it is &s;aid, had flattered him&s;elf with expectations that John&s;on would dedicate the work to him, attempted, in a courtly manner, to &s;ooth, and in&s;inuate him&s;elf with the &s;age, con&s;cious, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of the cold indifference with which he had treated its learned authour; and further attempted to conciliate him, by writing two papers in <Q REND="inline">"The World,"</Q> in recommendation of the work; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that they contain &s;ome &s;tudied compliments, &s;o finely turned, that if there had been no previous offence, it is probable that John&s;on would have been highly delighted. Prai&s;e, in general, was plea&s;ing to him; but by prai&s;e from a man of rank and elegant accompli&s;hments, he was peculiarly gratified.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I think the publick in general, and the republick of letters in particular, are greatly obliged to Mr. John&s;on, for having undertaken, and executed, &s;o great and de&s;irable a work. Perfection is not to be expected from man: but if we are to judge by the various works of John&s;on already publi&s;hed, we have good rea&s;on to believe, that he will bring this as near to perfection as any one man could do. The Plan of it, which he publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago, &s;eems to me to be a proof of it. Nothing can be more rationally imagined, or more accurately and elegantly expre&s;&s;ed. I therefore recommend the previous peru&s;al of it to all tho&s;e who intend to buy the Dictionary, and who, I &s;uppo&s;e, are all tho&s;e who can afford it.</Q></P>
<Q><P>* * * * * * * *</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, that our language is, at pre&s;ent, in a &s;tate of anarchy, and hitherto, perhaps, it may not have been the wor&s;e for it. During our
<PB N="140" REF="171" MS="y">
 free and open trade, many words and expre&s;&s;ions have been imported, adopted and naturalized from other languages, which have greatly enriched our own. Let it &s;till pre&s;erve what real &s;trength and beauty it may have borrowed from others; but let it not, like the Tarpeian maid, be overwhelmed and cru&s;hed by unnece&s;&s;ary ornaments. The time for difcrimination &s;eems to be now come. Toleration, adoption, and naturalization have run their lengths. Good order and authority are now nece&s;&s;ary. But where &s;hall we find them, and, at the &s;ame time, the obedience due to them? We mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the old Roman expedient in times of confu&s;ion, and chu&s;e a dictator. Upon this principle, I give my vote for Mr. John&s;on to fill that great and arduous po&s;t. And I hereby declare, that I make a total &s;urrender of all my rights and privileges in the Engli&s;h language, as a free-born Briti&s;h &s;ubject, to the &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, during the term of his dictator&s;hip. Nay more, I will not only obey him, like an old Roman, as my dictator, but, like a modern Roman, I will implicitly believe in him as my Pope, and hold him to be infallible while in the chair, but no longer. More than this he cannot well require; for, I pre&s;ume, that obedience can never be expected, when there is neither terrour to enforce, nor intere&s;t to invite it.</P>
<P>* * * * * * * *</P>
<P>But a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a Hi&s;tory of our Language through its &s;everal &s;tages, were &s;till wanting at home, and importunately called for from abroad. Mr. John&s;on's labours will now, I dare &s;ay, very fully &s;upply that want, and greatly contribute to the farther &s;preading of our language in other countries. Learners were di&s;couraged, by finding no &s;tandard to re&s;ort to; and, con&s;equently, thought it incapable of any. They will now be undeceived and encouraged.</P></Q>
<P>This courtly device failed of its effect. John&s;on, who thought that <Q REND="inline">"all was fal&s;e and hollow,"</Q> de&s;pi&s;ed the honeyed words, and was even indignant that Lord Che&s;terfield &s;hould, for a moment, imagine, that he could be the dupe of &s;uch an artifice. His expre&s;&s;ion to me concerning Lord Che&s;terfield, upon this occa&s;ion, was, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, after making great profe&s;&s;ions, he had, for many years, taken no notice of me; but when my Dictionary was coming out, he fell a &s;cribbling in the World about it. Upon which, I wrote him a letter, expre&s;&s;ed in civil terms, but &s;uch as might &s;hew him that I did not mind what he &s;aid or wrote, and that I had done with him."</Q></P>
<P>This is that celebrated letter, of which &s;o much has been &s;aid, and about which curio&s;ity has been &s;o long excited, without being gratified. I for many years &s;olicited John&s;on to favour me with a copy of it, that &s;o excellent a

He delayed from time to time to give it me; till at la&s;t in 1781, when we were on a vi&s;it at Mr. Dilly's, at Southill in Bedford&s;hire, he was plea&s;ed to dictate it to me from memory. He afterwards found among his papers a copy of it, with its title and cor|rections, in his own hand-writing. This he gave to Mr. Langton; adding, that if it were to come into print, he wi&s;hed it to be from that copy. By Mr. Langton's kindne&s;s, I am enabled to enrich my work with a perfect tran&s;cript of what the world has &s;o eagerly de&s;ired to &s;ee.</P>

<P>I HAVE been lately informed, by the proprietor of the World, that two papers, in which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick, were written by your Lord&s;hip. To be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, is an honour, which, being very little accu&s;tomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.</P>
<P>When, upon &s;ome &s;light encouragement, I fir&s;t vi&s;ited your Lord&s;hip, I was overpowered, like the re&s;t of mankind, by the enchantment of your addre&s;s; and could not forbear to wi&s;h that I might boa&s;t my&s;elf <HI>Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre;</HI>&mdash;that I might obtain that regard for which I &s;aw the world contending; but I found my attendance &s;o little encouraged, that neither pride nor mode&s;ty would &s;uffer me to continue it.

</LETTER>
<P><Q REND="inline">"While this was the talk of the town, (&s;ays Dr. Adams, in a letter to me) I happened to vi&s;it Dr. Warburton, who finding that I was acquainted with John&s;on, de&s;ired me earne&s;tly to carry his compliments to him, and to tell him, that he honoured him for his manly behaviour in rejecting the&s;e conde|&s;cen&s;ions of Lord Che&s;terfield, and for re&s;enting the treatment he had received from him, with a proper &s;pirit. John&s;on was vi&s;ibly plea&s;ed with this compliment,
<PB N="143" REF="174" MS="y">
for he had always a high opinion of Warburton."</Q>&mdash;Indeed, the force of mind  which appeared in this letter, was congenial with that which Warburton him&s;elf amply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is a curious minute circum&s;tance which &s;truck me, in comparing the various editions of John&s;on's imitations of Juvenal. In the tenth Satire, one of the couplets upon the vanity of wi&s;hes even for literary di&s;tinction &s;tood thus:
<Q><L>"Yet think what ills the &s;cholar's life a&s;&s;ail,</L>
<L>"Pride, envy, want, the <HI>garret,</HI> and the jail."</L></Q>
But after experiencing the unea&s;ine&s;s which Lord Che&s;terfield's fallacious patronage made him feel, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the word <HI>garret</HI> from the &s;ad group, and in all the &s;ub&s;equent editions the line &s;tands
<Q><L>"Pride, envy, want, the <HI>Patron,</HI> and the jail."</L></Q></P>
<P>That Lord Che&s;terfield mu&s;t have been mortified by the lofty contempt, and polite, yet keen &s;atire with which John&s;on exhibited him to him&s;elf in this letter, it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt. He, however, with that glo&s;&s;y duplicity which was his con&s;tant &s;tudy, affected to be quite unconcerned. Dr. Adams mentioned to Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley that he was &s;orry John&s;on had written his letter to Lord Che&s;terfield. Dod&s;ley, with the true feelings of trade, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"he was very &s;orry too; for that he had a property in the Dictionary, to which his Lord&s;hip's patronage might have been of con&s;equence."</Q> He then told Dr. Adams, that Lord Che&s;terfield had &s;hewn him the letter. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have imagined (replied Dr. Adams) that Lord Che&s;terfield would have concealed it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Poh! (&s;aid Dod&s;ley) do you think a letter from John&s;on could hurt Lord Che&s;terfield? Not at all, Sir. It lay upon his table, where any body might &s;ee it. He read it to me; &s;aid, 'this man has great powers,' pointed out the &s;evere&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, and ob&s;erved how well they were expre&s;&s;ed."</Q> This air of indifference, which impo&s;ed upon the worthy Dod&s;ley, was certainly nothing but a &s;pecimen of that di&s;&s;imulation which Lord Che&s;terfield inculcated as one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential le&s;&s;ons for the conduct of life. His Lord&s;hip endeavoured to ju&s;tify him&s;elf to Dod&s;ley from the charges brought again&s;t him by John&s;on; but we may judge of the flim&s;ine&s;s of his defence, from his having excu&s;ed his neglect of John&s;on, by &s;aying that <Q REND="inline">"he had heard he had changed his lodgings, and did not know where he lived;"</Q> as if there could have been the &s;malle&s;t difficulty to inform him&s;elf of that circum&s;tance, by
<PB N="144" REF="175" MS="y">
 inquiring in the literary circle with which his Lord&s;hip was well acquainted, and was, indeed, him&s;elf one of its ornaments.</P>
<P>Dr. Adams expo&s;tulated with John&s;on, and &s;ugge&s;ted, that his not being admitted when he called on him, was, probably, not to be imputed to Lord Che&s;terfield; for his Lord&s;hip had declared to Dod&s;ley, that <Q REND="inline">"he would have turned off the be&s;t &s;ervant he ever had, if he had known that he denied him to a man who would have been always more than welcome;"</Q> and, in confirmation of this, he in&s;i&s;ted on Lord Che&s;terfield's general affability and ea&s;ine&s;s of acce&s;s, e&s;pecially to literary men. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on) that is not Lord Che&s;ter|field; he is the proude&s;t man this day exi&s;ting."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, (&s;aid Dr. Adams) there is one per&s;on, at lea&s;t, as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But mine (replied John&s;on, in&s;tantly) was <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> pride."</Q> This, as Dr. Adams well ob&s;erved, was one of tho&s;e happy turns for which he was &s;o remarkably ready.</P>
<P>John&s;on having now explicitly avowed his opinion of Lord Che&s;terfield, did not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf concerning that nobleman with pointed freedom: <Q REND="inline">"This man (&s;aid he) I thought had been a Lord among wits; but, I find, he is only a wit among Lords!"</Q> And when his Letters to his natural &s;on were publi&s;hed, he ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing-ma&s;ter <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">That collection of letters cannot be vindicated from the &s;erious charge of encouraging, in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, one of the vices mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the good order and comfort of &s;ociety, which his Lord&s;hip repre&s;ents as mere fa&s;hionable gallantry; and, in others, of inculcating the ba&s;e practice of di&s;&s;imulation, and recommending, with di&s;proportionate anxiety, a perpetual attention to external elegance of manner. But it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time be allowed, that they contain many good precepts of conduct, and much genuine information upon life and manners, very happily expre&s;&s;ed; and that there was con&s;iderable merit in paying &s;o much attention to the improvement of one who was dependent upon his Lord&s;hip's protection; it has, probably, been exceeded in no in&s;tance by the mo&s;t exemplary parent; and though I can by no means approve of confounding the di&s;tinction between lawful and illicit offspring, which is, in effect, in&s;ulting the civil e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our country, to look no higher; I cannot help thinking it laudable to be kindly attentive to tho&s;e, of who&s;e exi&s;tence we have, in any way, been the cau&s;e. Mr. Stanhope's character has been unju&s;tly repre&s;ented as diametrically oppo&s;ite to what Lord Che&s;terfield wi&s;hed him to be. He has been called dull, gro&s;s, and aukward: but I knew him at Dre&s;den, when he was Envoy to that court; and though he could not boa&s;t of the <HI>graces,</HI> he was, in truth, a &s;en&s;ible, civil, well-behaved man.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The character of a <Q REND="inline">"re&s;pectable Hottentot,"</Q> in Lord Che&s;terfield's letters, has been generally under&s;tood to be meant for John&s;on, and I have no doubt that it was. But I remember when the <HI>Literary Property</HI> of tho&s;e letters was
<PB N="145" REF="176" MS="y">
conte&s;ted in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion in Scotland, and Mr. Henry Dundas, one of the Coun&s;el for the proprietors, read this character as an exhibition of John&s;on, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, one of the Judges, maintained, with &s;ome warmth, that it was not intended as a portrait of John&s;on, but of a late noble Lord, di&s;tingui&s;hed for ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience. I have heard John&s;on him&s;elf talk of the character, and &s;ay that it was meant for George Lord Lyttelton, in which I could by no means agree; for his Lord&s;hip had nothing of that violence which is a con&s;picuous feature in the compo&s;ition. Finding that my illu&s;trious friend could bear to have it &s;uppo&s;ed that it might be meant for him, I &s;aid, laughingly, that there was one trait which unque&s;tionably did not belong to him; <Q REND="inline">"he throws his meat any where but down his throat."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) Lord Che&s;terfield never &s;aw me eat in his life."</Q></P>
<P>On the 6th of March came out Lord Bolingbroke's works, publi&s;hed by Mr. David Mallet. The wild and pernicious ravings, under the name of <Q REND="inline">"Philo&s;ophy,"</Q> which were thus u&s;hered into the world, gave great offence to all well-principled men. John&s;on, hearing of their tendency, which nobody di&s;puted, was rou&s;ed with a ju&s;t indignation, and pronounced this memorable &s;entence upon the noble authour and his editor. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he was a &s;coundrel, and a coward: a &s;coundrel, for charging a blunderbu&s;s again&s;t religion and morality; a coward, becau&s;e he had not re&s;olution to fire it off him&s;elf, but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman, to draw the trigger after his death!"</Q> Garrick, who I can atte&s;t from my own knowledge, had his mind &s;ea&s;oned with pious reverence, and &s;incerely di&s;approved of the infidel writings of &s;everal, whom, in the cour&s;e of his almo&s;t univer&s;al gay intercour&s;e with men of eminence, he treated with external civility, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion. Mr. Pelham having died on the very day on which Lord Bolingbroke's works came out, he wrote an elegant Ode on his death, beginning
<Q><L>"Let others hail the ri&s;ing &s;un,</L>
<L>"I bow to that who&s;e cour&s;e is run."</L></Q>
in which is the following &s;tanza:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Of his conver&s;ation while at Oxford at this time, Mr. Warton has pre&s;erved and communicated to me the following memorial, which, though not written
<PB N="147" REF="178" MS="y">
with all the care and attention which that learned and elegant writer be&s;tows on tho&s;e compo&s;itions which he intends for the publick eye, is &s;o happily expre&s;&s;ed in an ea&s;y &s;tyle, that I &s;hould injure it by any alteration:</P>
<Q><P>When John&s;on came to Oxford in 1754, the long vacation was begin|ning, and mo&s;t people were leaving the place. This was the fir&s;t time of his being there, after quitting the Univer&s;ity. The next morning after his arrival, he wi&s;hed to &s;ee his old College, <HI>Pembroke.</HI> I went with him. He was highly plea&s;ed to find all the College-&s;ervants which he had left there &s;till remaining, particularly a very old butler; and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at being recogni&s;ed by them, and conver&s;ed with them familiarly. He waited on the ma&s;ter, Dr. Radcliffe, who received him very coldly. John&s;on at lea&s;t expected, that the ma&s;ter would order a copy of his Dictionary, now near publication: but the ma&s;ter did not choo&s;e to talk on the &s;ubject, never a&s;ked John&s;on to dine, nor even to vi&s;it him, while he &s;tayed at Oxford. After we had left the Lodgings, John&s;on &s;aid to me, <HI>'There</HI> lives a man, who lives by the revenues of literature, and will not move a finger to &s;upport it. If I come to live at Oxford, I &s;hall take up my abode at Trinity.' We then called on the Reverend Mr. Meeke, one of the fellows, and of John&s;on's &s;tanding. Here was a mo&s;t cordial greeting on both &s;ides. On leaving him, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I u&s;ed to think Meeke had excellent parts, when we were boys together at the College: but, alas!
<Q><L>'Lo&s;t in a convent's &s;olitary gloom!'</L></Q>
I remember, at the cla&s;&s;ical lecture in the Hall, I could not bear Meeke's &s;uperiority, and I tried to &s;it as far from him as I could, that I might not hear him con&s;true.'</Q></P>
<P>As we were leaving the College, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Here I tran&s;lated Pope's Me&s;&s;iah. Which do you think is the be&s;t line in it? My own favourite is,
<Q><L>'Vallis aromaticas fundit Saronica nubes.'</L></Q></Q>
I told him, I thought it a very &s;onorous hexameter. I did not tell him, it was not in the Virgilian &s;tyle. He much regretted that his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> tutor was dead; for whom he &s;eemed to retain the greate&s;t regard. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I once had been a whole morning &s;liding <HI>[&s;kating]</HI> in Chri&s;t-Church Meadow, and mi&s;&s;ed his lecture in logick. After dinner, he &s;ent for me to his room. I expected a &s;harp rebuke for my idlene&s;s, and went with a beating heart. When we were &s;eated, he told me he had &s;ent for me to drink a gla&s;s of wine with him, and
<PB N="148" REF="179" MS="y">
 to tell me, he was <HI>not</HI> angry with me for mi&s;&s;ing his lecture. This was, in fact, a mo&s;t &s;evere reprimand. Some more of the boys were then &s;ent for, and we &s;pent a very plea&s;ant afternoon.'</Q> Be&s;ides Mr. Meeke, there was only one other Fellow of Pembroke now re&s;ident: from both of whom John&s;on received the greate&s;t civilities during this vi&s;it, and they pre&s;&s;ed him very much to have a room in the College.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this vi&s;it (1754), John&s;on and I walked, three or four times, to Ellsfield, a village beautifully &s;ituated about three miles from Oxford, to &s;ee Mr. Wi&s;e, Radclivian librarian, with whom John&s;on was much plea&s;ed. At this place, Mr. Wi&s;e had fitted up a hou&s;e and gardens, in a &s;ingular manner, but with great ta&s;te. Here was an excellent library; particularly, a valuable collection of books in Northern literature, with which John&s;on was often very bu&s;y. One day Mr. Wi&s;e read to us a di&s;&s;ertation which he was preparing for the pre&s;s, intitled, 'A Hi&s;tory and Chronology of the fabulous Ages.' Some old divinities of Thrace, related to the Titans, and called the CABIRI, made a very important part of the theory of this piece; and in conver&s;ation afterwards, Mr. Wi&s;e talked much of his CABIRI. As we returned to Oxford in the evening, I out-walked John&s;on, and he cried out <HI>Sufflamina,</HI> a Latin word which came from his mouth with peculiar grace, and was as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Put on your drag-chain.</HI> Before we got home, I again walked too fa&s;t for him; and he now cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Why, you walk as if you were pur&s;ued by all the CABIRI in a body.'</Q> In an evening, we frequently took long walks from Oxford into the country, returning to &s;up|per. Once, in our way home, we viewed the ruins of the abbies of O&s;eney and Rewley, near Oxford. After at lea&s;t half an hour's &s;ilence, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I viewed them with indignation!'</Q> We had then a long conver&s;ation on Gothick buildings; and in talking of the form of old halls, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'In the&s;e halls, the fire-place was anciently always in the middle of the room, till the Whigs removed it on one &s;ide.'</Q>&mdash;About this time there had been an execution of two or three criminals at Oxford on a Monday. Soon after|wards, one day at dinner, I was &s;aying that Mr. Swinton the chaplain of the gaol, and al&s;o a frequent preacher before the Univer&s;ity, a learned man, but often thoughtle&s;s and ab&s;ent, preached the condemnation-&s;ermon on repentance, before the convicts, on the preceding day, Sunday: and that in the clo&s;e he told his audience, that he &s;hould give them the remainder of what he had to &s;ay on the &s;ubject, the next Lord's Day. Upon which, one of our company, a Doctor of Divinity, and a plain matter-of-fact-man, by way of offering an apology for Mr. Swinton, gravely remarked, that he had probably preached
<PB N="149" REF="180">
the &s;ame &s;ermon before the Univer&s;ity: <Q REND="inline">'Yes, Sir, (&s;ays John&s;on) but the Univer&s;ity were not to be hanged the next morning.'</Q></P>
<P>I forgot to ob&s;erve before, that when he left Mr. Meeke, (as I have told above) he added, <Q REND="inline">'About the &s;ame time of life, Meeke was left behind at Oxford to feed on a Fellow&s;hip, and I went to London to get my living: now, Sir, &s;ee the difference of our literary characters!</Q></P></Q>

<P>IF you imagine that by delaying my an&s;wer I intended to &s;hew any neglect of the notice with which you have favoured me, you will neither think ju&s;tly of your&s;elf nor of me.

<P>When you have lei&s;ure to think again upon me, let me be favoured with another letter; and another yet, when you have looked into my Dictionary.

<P>Mr. Andrew Millar, book&s;eller in the Strand, took the principal charge of conducting the publication of John&s;on's Dictionary; and as the patience of the proprietors was repeatedly tried and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, by their expecting that the work would be completed within the time which John&s;on had &s;anguinely &s;uppo&s;ed, the learned authour was often goaded to di&s;patch, more e&s;pecially as he had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a con&s;iderable time before he had fini&s;hed his ta&s;k. When the me&s;&s;enger who carried the la&s;t &s;heet to Millar returned, John&s;on a&s;ked him, <Q REND="inline">"Well, what did he &s;ay?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, (an&s;wered the me&s;&s;enger) he &s;aid, thank GOD I have done with him.&punc;</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I am glad (replied John&s;on, with a &s;mile,) that he thanks GOD for any thing <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Sir John Hawkins, p. 341, in&s;erts two notes as having pa&s;&s;ed formally between Andrew Millar and John&s;on, to the above effect.

 is remarkable, that tho&s;e with whom John&s;on chiefly contracted for his literary labours were Scotchmen, Mr. Millar and Mr. Strahan.

<P>The Dictionary, with a Grammar and Hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h Language, being now at length publi&s;hed, in two volumes folio, the world contemplated with wonder &s;o &s;tupendous a work atchieved by one man, while other countries had thought &s;uch undertakings fit only for whole academies. Va&s;t as his powers were, I cannot but think that his imagination deceived him, when he &s;uppo&s;ed that by con&s;tant application he might have performed the ta&s;k in three years. Let the Preface be attentively peru&s;ed, in which is given, in a clear, &s;trong, and glowing &s;tyle, a comprehen&s;ive, yet particular view of what he had done; and it will be evident, that the time he employed upon it was comparatively &s;hort. I am unwilling to &s;well my book with long quotations from what is in every body's hands; and I believe there are few pro&s;e compo&s;itions in the Engli&s;h language that are read with more delight, or are more impre&s;&s;ed upon the memory, than that preliminary di&s;cour&s;e. One of its excellencies has always &s;truck me with peculiar admiration; I mean the per&s;picuity with which he has expre&s;&s;ed ab&s;tract &s;cientifick notions. As an in&s;tance of this, I &s;hall quote the following &s;entence: <Q REND="inline">"When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifi|cations, how can a con&s;ecutive &s;eries be formed of &s;en&s;es in their own nature collateral?"</Q> We have here an example of what has been often &s;aid, and I believe with ju&s;tice, that there is for every thought a certain nice adaptation of words which none other could equal, and which, when a man has been &s;o fortunate as to hit, he has attained, in that particular ca&s;e, to the perfection of language.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive reading which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the accumulation of authorities, and which alone may account for John&s;on's retentive mind being enriched with a very large and various &s;tore of knowledge and imagery, mu&s;t have occupied &s;everal years. The Preface furni&s;hes an eminent in&s;tance of a double talent, of which John&s;on was fully con&s;cious. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds
<PB N="163" REF="194" MS="y">
has heard him &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"There are two things which I am confident I can do very well: one is an introduction to any literary work, &s;tating what it is to contain, and how it &s;hould be executed in the mo&s;t perfect manner; the other is a conclu&s;ion, &s;hewing from various cau&s;es why the execution has not been equal to what the authour promi&s;ed to him&s;elf and to the publick."</Q></P>
<P>How &s;hould puny &s;cribblers be aba&s;hed and di&s;appointed, when they find him di&s;playing a perfect theory of lexicographical excellence, yet at the &s;ame time candidly and mode&s;tly allowing that he <Q REND="inline">"had not &s;atisfied his own expectations."</Q> Here was a fair occa&s;ion for the exerci&s;e of John&s;on's mode&s;ty, when he was called upon to compare his own arduous performance, not with tho&s;e of other individuals, (in which ca&s;e his inflexible regard to truth would have been violated, had he affected diffidence,) but with &s;peculative perfection; as he, who can out&s;trip all his competitors in the race, may yet be &s;en&s;ible of his deficiency when he runs again&s;t time. Well might he &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"the Engli&s;h Dictionary was written with little a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the learned;"</Q> for he told me, that the only aid which he received was a paper containing twenty etymo|logies, &s;ent to him by a per&s;on then unknown, who he was afterwards informed was Dr. Pearce, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. The etymologies, though they exhibit learning and judgement, are not, I think, entitled to the fir&s;t prai&s;e among&s;t the various parts of this immen&s;e work. The definitions have always appeared to me &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing proofs of acutene&s;s of intellect and preci&s;ion of lan|guage, as indicate a genius of the highe&s;t rank. This it is which marks the &s;uperiour excellence of John&s;on's Dictionary over others equally or even more voluminous, and mu&s;t have made it a work of much greater mental labour than mere Lexicons, or <HI>Word Books,</HI> as the Dutch call them. They, who will make the experiment of trying how they can define a few words of whatever nature, will &s;oon be &s;atisfied of the unque&s;tionable ju&s;tice of this ob&s;ervation, which I can a&s;&s;ure my readers is founded upon much &s;tudy, and upon com|munication with more minds than my own.</P>
<P>A few of his definitions mu&s;t be admitted to be erroneous. Thus, <HI>Wind|ward</HI> and <HI>Leeward,</HI> though directly of oppo&s;ite meaning, are defined identically the &s;ame way; as to which incon&s;iderable &s;pecks it is enough to ob&s;erve, that his Preface announces that he was aware there might be many &s;uch in &s;o immen&s;e a work; nor was he at all di&s;concerted when an in&s;tance was pointed out to him. A lady once a&s;ked him how he came to define <HI>Pa&s;tern</HI> the <HI>knee</HI> of a hor&s;e: in&s;tead of making an elaborate defence, as &s;he expected, he at once an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance."</Q> His definition of <HI>Network</HI> has been often quoted with &s;portive malignity, as ob&s;curing a thing
<PB N="164" REF="195" MS="y"> in it&s;elf very plain. But to the&s;e frivolous cen&s;ures no other an&s;wer is nece&s;|&s;ary than that with which we are furni&s;hed by his own Preface. <Q REND="inline">"To explain, requires the u&s;e of terms le&s;s ab&s;tru&s;e than that which is to be explained, and &s;uch terms cannot always be found. For as nothing can be proved but by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;omething intuitively known, and evident without proof, &s;o nothing can be defined but by the u&s;e of words too plain to admit of definition. Some|times ea&s;ier words are changed into harder; as, <HI>burial,</HI> into <HI>&s;epulture</HI> or <HI>interment; dry,</HI> into <HI>de&s;iecative; dryne&s;s,</HI> into <HI>&s;iccity</HI> or <HI>aridity; fit,</HI> into <HI>paroxy&s;m;</HI> for, the <HI>ea&s;ie&s;t</HI> word, whatever it be, can never be tran&s;lated into one more ea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P>His introducing his own opinions, and even prejudices, under general definitions of words, while at the &s;ame time the original meaning of the words is not explained, as his <HI>Tory, Whig, Pen&s;ion, Oats, Exci&s;e,</HI> and a few more, cannot be fully defended, and mu&s;t be placed to the account of capricious and humourous indulgence. Talking to me upon this &s;ubject when we were at A&s;hbourne in 1777, he mentioned a &s;till &s;tronger in&s;tance of the predomi|nance of his private feelings in the compo&s;ition of this work, than any now to be found in it. <Q REND="inline">"You know, Sir, Lord Gower for&s;ook the old Jacobite intere&s;t. When I came to the word <HI>Renegado,</HI> after telling that it meant 'one who de&s;erts to the enemy, a revolter,' I added, <HI>Sometimes we &s;ay a</HI> GOWER. Thus it went to the pre&s;s; but the printer had more wit than I, and &s;truck it out."</Q></P>
<P>Let it, however, be remembered, that this indulgence does not di&s;play it&s;elf only in &s;arca&s;m towards others, but &s;ometimes in playful allu&s;ion to the notions commonly entertained of his own laborious ta&s;k. Thus: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Grub-&s;treet,</HI> the name of a &s;treet in London, much inhabited by writers of &s;mall hi&s;tories, <HI>dictionaries,</HI> and temporary poems; whence any mean production is called <HI>Grub-&s;treet.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Lexicographer,</HI> a writer of dictionaries, a <HI>harmle&s;s drudge."</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the time when he was concluding his very eloquent Preface, John&s;on's mind appears to have been in &s;uch a &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion, that we cannot con|template without wonder the vigorous and &s;plendid thoughts which &s;o highly di&s;tingui&s;h that performance. <Q REND="inline">"I (&s;ays he) may &s;urely be contented without the prai&s;e of perfection, which if I could obtain in this gloom of &s;olitude, what would it avail me? I have protracted my work till mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom I wi&s;hed to plea&s;e, have &s;unk into the grave; and &s;ucce&s;s and mi&s;carriage are empty &s;ounds. I therefore di&s;mi&s;s it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear or hope from cen&s;ure or from prai&s;e."</Q> That this indifference was rather
<PB N="165" REF="196" MS="y">
a temporary than an habitual feeling, appears, I think, from his letters to Mr. Warton; and however he may have been affected for the moment, certain it is that the honours which his great work procured him, both at home and abroad, were very grateful to him. His friend the Earl of Corke and Orrery, being at Florence, pre&s;ented it to the <HI>Academia della Cru&s;ca.</HI> That Academy &s;ent John&s;on their <HI>Vocabulario,</HI> and the French Academy &s;ent him their <HI>Dictionnaire,</HI> which Mr. Langton had the plea&s;ure to convey to him.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t undoubtedly &s;eem &s;trange, that the conclu&s;ion of his Preface &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed in terms &s;o de&s;ponding, when it is con&s;idered that the authour was then only in his forty-&s;ixth year. But we mu&s;t a&s;cribe its gloom to that mi&s;erable dejection of &s;pirits to which he was con&s;titutionally &s;ubject, and which was aggravated by the death of his wife two years before. I have heard it ingeniou&s;ly ob&s;erved by a lady of rank and elegance, that <Q REND="inline">"his melan|choly was then at its meridian."</Q> It plea&s;ed GOD to grant him almo&s;t thirty years of life after this time; and once, when he was in a placid frame of mind, he was obliged to own to me that he had enjoyed happier days, and had had many more friends, &s;ince that gloomy hour than before.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ad &s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom he wi&s;hed to plea&s;e had &s;unk into the grave,"</Q> and his ca&s;e at forty-five was &s;ingularly unhappy, unle&s;s the circle of his friends was very narrow. I have often thought, that as longevity is generally de&s;ired, and, I believe, generally expected, it would be wi&s;e to be continually adding to the number of our friends, that the lo&s;s of &s;ome may be &s;upplied by others. Friend&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"the wine of life,"</Q> &s;hould, like a well|&s;tocked cellar, be thus continually renewed; and it is con&s;olatory to think, that although we can &s;eldom add what will equal the generous <HI>fir&s;t-growths</HI> of our youth, yet friend&s;hip becomes in&s;en&s;ibly old in much le&s;s time than is com|monly imagined&punc; and not many years are required to make it very mellow and plea&s;ant. Warmth will, no doubt, make a con&s;iderable difference. Men of affectionate temper and bright fancy will coale&s;ce a great deal &s;ooner than tho&s;e who are cold and dull.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition which I have now endeavoured to illu&s;trate was, at an after period of his life, the opinion of John&s;on him&s;elf. He &s;aid to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, <Q REND="inline">"If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life, he will &s;oon find him&s;elf left alone. A man, Sir, &s;hould keep his friend|&s;hip in <HI>con&s;tant repair."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. Wilkes, who&s;e notions and habits of life were very oppo&s;ite to his, but who was ever eminent for literature and vivacity, &s;allied forth with a little <HI>Jeu d' E&s;prit</HI> upon the following pa&s;&s;age in his Grammar of
<PB N="166" REF="197" MS="y"> the Engli&s;h Tongue, prefixed to the Dictionary: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"H</HI> &s;eldom, perhaps never, begins any but the fir&s;t &s;yllable."</Q> In an e&s;&s;ay printed in the Publick Adver|ti&s;er, this lively writer enumerated many in&s;tances in oppo&s;ition to this remark; for example, <Q REND="inline">"The authour of this ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be a man of a quick <HI>appre-hen&s;ion,</HI> and of a mo&s;t <HI>compre-hen&s;ive</HI> genius."</Q> The po&s;ition is un|doubtedly expre&s;&s;ed with too much latitude.</P>
<P>This light &s;ally, we may &s;uppo&s;e, made no great impre&s;&s;ion on our Lexi|cographer, for we find that he never altered the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>He had the plea&s;ure of being treated in a very different manner by his old pupil Mr. Garrick, in the following complimentary Epigram:</P>

ma&s;ter of his principles and experiments, wrote for him a pamphlet, publi&s;hed in quarto, with the following title; <Q REND="inline">"An Account of an Attempt to a&s;certain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Theory of the Variation of the magnetical Needle; with a Table of the Variations at the mo&s;t remarkable Cities in Europe, from the year 1660 to 1860."</Q> To diffu&s;e it more exten&s;ively, it was accompanied with an Italian tran&s;lation on the oppo&s;ite page, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed was the work of Signor Baretti, an Italian of con&s;iderable literature, who having come to England a few years before, had been employed in the capacity both of a language-ma&s;ter and an authour, and formed an intimacy with Dr. John&s;on. This pamphlet John&s;on pre&s;ented to the Bodleian Library <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See note by Mr. Warton, p. 149.</NOTE>. On a blank leaf of it is pa&s;ted a paragraph cut out of a new&s;paper, con|taining an account of the death and character of Williams, plainly written by John&s;on <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"On Saturday the 12th, about twelve at night, died Mr. Zachariah Williams, in his eighty-third year, after an illne&s;s of eight months, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mental faculties.

He was a man of indu&s;try indefatigable, of conver&s;ation inoffen&s;ive, patient of adver&s;ity and di&s;ca&s;e, eminently &s;ober, tem|perate, and pious; and worthy to have ended life with better fortune."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In July this year he had formed &s;ome &s;cheme of mental improvement, the particular purpo&s;e of which does not appear.

<P><MILESTONE N="1756"> In 1756 John&s;on found that the great fame of his Dictionary had not &s;et him above the nece&s;&s;ity of <Q REND="inline">"making provi&s;ion for the day that was pa&s;&s;ing over him."</Q> No royal or noble patron extended a munificent hand to give independence to the man who had conferred &s;tability on the language of his country. We may feel indignant that there &s;hould have been &s;uch unworthy neglect; but we mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, congratulate our&s;elves, that to this very neglect, operating to rou&s;e the natural indolence of his con&s;titution, we owe many valuable productions, which otherwi&s;e, perhaps, might never have appeared.</P>
<P>He had &s;pent, during the progre&s;s of the work, the money for which he had contracted to write his Dictionary. We have &s;een that the reward of his labour was only fifteen hundred and &s;eventy-five pounds; and when the expence of amanuen&s;es and paper, and other articles are deducted, his clear profit was
<PB N="168" REF="199" MS="y">
<MILESTONE N="1756. Aetat. 47."> very incon&s;iderable. I once &s;aid to him <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Sir, you did not get more for your Dictionary."</Q> His an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry too. But it was very well. The book&s;ellers are generous liberal-minded men."</Q> He, upon all occa&s;ions, did ample ju&s;tice to their character in this re&s;pect. He con&s;idered them as the patrons of literature; and, indeed, although they have eventually been con&s;iderable gainers by his Dictionary, it is to them that we owe its having been undertaken and carried through at the ri&s;k of great expence, for they were not ab&s;olutely &s;ure of being indemnified.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of this year we find from his private devotions, that he had then recovered from &s;ickne&s;s <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 25.</NOTE>; and in February that his eye was re&s;tored to its u&s;e <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 27.</NOTE>. The pious gratitude with which he acknowledges mercies upon every occa&s;ion is very edifying; as is the humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which he breathes when it is the will of his heavenly Father to try him with afflictions. As &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions become the &s;tate of man here, and are the true effects of religious di&s;cipline, we cannot but venerate in John&s;on one of the mo&s;t exerci&s;ed minds that our holy religion hath ever formed. If there be any thoughtle&s;s enough to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch exerci&s;e the weakne&s;s of a great under&s;tanding, let them look up to John&s;on, and be convinced that what he &s;o earne&s;tly practi&s;ed mu&s;t have a rational foundation.</P>
<P>His works this year were, an ab&s;tract or epitome, in octavo, of his folio Dictionary, and a few e&s;&s;ays in a monthly publication, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"THE UNIVERSAL VISITER."</Q> Chri&s;topher Smart, with who&s;e unhappy vacillation of mind he &s;incerely &s;ympathi&s;ed, was one of the &s;tated undertakers of this mi&s;cellany; and it was to a&s;&s;i&s;t him that John&s;on &s;ometimes employed his pen. All the e&s;&s;ays marked with two <HI>a&s;teri&s;ks</HI> have been a&s;cribed to him; but I am confident, from internal evidence, that of the&s;e, neither <Q REND="inline">"The Life of Chaucer,"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Reflections on the State of Portugal,"</Q> nor an <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on Architecture,"</Q> were written by him. I am equally confident, upon the &s;ame evidence, that he wrote <Q REND="inline">"Further Thoughts on Agriculture, &dagger;"</Q> being the &s;equel of a very inferiour e&s;&s;ay on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and which, though carried on as if by the &s;ame hand, is both in thinking and expre&s;&s;ion &s;o far above it, and &s;o &s;trikingly peculiar, as to leave no doubt of its true parent; and that he al&s;o wrote <Q REND="inline">"A Di&s;&s;ertation on the State of Literature and Authours, &dagger;"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"A Di&s;&s;ertation on the Epitaphs written by Pope. &dagger;"</Q> The la&s;t of the&s;e, indeed, he afterwards added to his <Q REND="inline">"Idler."</Q> Why the e&s;&s;ays truly written by him are marked in the &s;ame manner with &s;ome he did not write, I cannot explain; but with diference to tho&s;e who have a&s;cribed to him the three e&s;&s;ays which
<PB N="169" REF="200" MS="y">
I have rejected, they want all the characteri&s;tical marks of John&s;onian compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>He engaged al&s;o to &s;uperintend and contribute largely to another monthly publication, entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE LITERARY MAGAZINE, OR UNIVERSAL REVIEW;"</Q> the fir&s;t number of which came out in May this year. What were his emolu|ments from this undertaking, and what other writers were employed in it, I have not di&s;covered. He continued to write in it, with intermi&s;&s;ions, till the fifteenth number; and I think that he never gave better proofs of the force, acutene&s;s, and vivacity of his mind, than in this mi&s;cellany, whether we con&s;ider his original e&s;&s;ays, or his reviews of the works of others. The <Q REND="inline">"Preliminary Addre&s;s"</Q> to the publick is a proof how this great man could embelli&s;h even &s;o trite a thing as the plan of a magazine with the graces of &s;uperiour compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>His original e&s;&s;ays are, <Q REND="inline">"An Introduction to the political State of Great-Britain; &dagger;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Remarks on the Militia Bill; &dagger;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on his Britan|nick Maje&s;ty's Treaties with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el; &dagger;</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;ervations on the pre&s;ent State of Affairs; &dagger;"</Q> and, <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of Frederick III.

In one in&s;tance only in the&s;e e&s;&s;ays has he indulged his <HI>Browni&s;m.</HI> Dr. Robert&s;on, the hi&s;torian, men|tioned it to me, as having at once convinced him that John&s;on was the authour of the <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia."</Q> Speaking of the pride which the old King, the father of his hero, took in being ma&s;ter of the talle&s;t regiment in Europe, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"To review this <HI>towering</HI> regiment was his daily plea&s;ure, and to perpetuate it was &s;o much his care, that when he met a tall woman he immediately commanded one of his <HI>Titanian</HI> retinue to marry her, that they might <HI>propagate procerity."</HI></Q> For this Anglo-Latian word <HI>procerity,</HI> John&s;on had, however, the authority of Addi&s;on.</P>

Mr. Thomas Davies, indeed, a&s;cribed to him the Review of Mr. Burke's <Q REND="inline">"Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful;"</Q> and Sir John Hawkins, with equal di&s;|cernment, has in&s;erted it in his collection of John&s;on's works. Whereas it has no re&s;emblance to John&s;on's compo&s;ition, and is well known to have been written by Mr. Murphy, who has acknowledged it to me and many others.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, in ju&s;tice to John&s;on's political character, which has been mi&s;repre&s;ented as abjectly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to power, that his <Q REND="inline">"Ob&s;erva|tions on the pre&s;ent State of Affairs,"</Q> glow with as animated a &s;pirit of con&s;titutional liberty as can be found any where. Thus he begins, <Q REND="inline">"The time is now come, in which every Engli&s;hman expects to be informed of the national affairs, and in which he has a right to have that expectation gratified. For whatever may be urged by mini&s;ters, or tho&s;e whom vanity or intere&s;t make the followers of mini&s;ters, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of confidence in our governours, and the pre&s;umption of prying with profane eyes into the rece&s;&s;es of policy, it is evident that this reverence can be claimed only by coun&s;els yet unexecuted, and projects &s;u&s;pended in deliberation. But when a de&s;ign has ended in mi&s;carriage or &s;ucce&s;s, when every eye and every ear is witne&s;s to general di&s;content, or general &s;atisfaction, it is then a proper time to di&s;en|tangle confu&s;ion and illu&s;trate ob&s;curity, to &s;hew by what cau&s;es every event was produced, and in what effects it is likely to terminate; to lay down with di&s;tinct particularity what rumour always huddles in general exclamation, or perplexes by indige&s;ted narratives; to &s;hew whence happine&s;s or calamity is derived, and whence it may be expected; and hone&s;tly to lay before the people what inquiry can gather of the pa&s;t, and conjecture can e&s;timate of the future."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="202" MS="y">
Here we have it a&s;&s;umed as an incontrovertible principle, that in this country the people are the &s;uperintendants of the conduct and mea&s;ures of tho&s;e by whom government is admini&s;tered, of the beneficial effect of which the pre&s;ent reign afforded an illu&s;trious example, when addre&s;&s;es from all parts of the kingdom controuled an audacious attempt to introduce a new power &s;ubver&s;ive of the crown.</P>
<P>A &s;till &s;tronger proof of his patriotick &s;pirit appears in his review of an <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on Waters, by Dr. Lucas;"</Q> of whom, after de&s;cribing him as a man well known to the world for his daring defiance of power, when he thought it exerted on the &s;ide of wrong, he thus &s;peaks: <Q REND="inline">"The Iri&s;h mini&s;ters drove him from his native country by a proclamation, in which they charged him with crimes of which they never intended to be called to the proof, and oppre&s;&s;ed him by methods equally irre&s;i&s;tible by guilt and innocence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Let the man thus driven into exile for having been the friend of his country, be received in every other place as a confe&s;&s;or of liberty; and let the tools of power be taught in time, that they may rob, but cannot impoveri&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>Some of his reviews in this magazine are very &s;hort accounts of the pieces noticed, and I mention them only that Dr. John&s;on's opinion of the works may be known; but many of them are examples of elaborate critici&s;m, in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;tyle. In his review of the <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of the Court of Augu&s;tus,"</Q> he has the re&s;olution to think and &s;peak from his own mind, regardle&s;s of the cant tran&s;mitted from age to age, in prai&s;e of the ancient Romans. Thus: <Q REND="inline">"I know not why any one but a &s;chool-boy in his declamation &s;hould whine over the Com|mon-wealth of Rome, which grew great only by the mi&s;ery of the re&s;t of man|kind. The Romans, like others, as &s;oon as they grew rich, grew corrupt; and in their corruption &s;old the lives and freedoms of them&s;elves, and of one another."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline">"A people, who while they were poor robbed mankind; and as &s;oon as they became rich, robbed one another."</Q> In his review of the Mi&s;cellanies in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, publi&s;hed by Elizabeth Harri&s;on, but written by many hands, he gives an eminent proof at once of his orthodoxy and candour. <Q REND="inline">"The authours of the e&s;&s;ays in pro&s;e &s;eem generally to have imitated, or tried to imitate, the copiou&s;ne&s;s and luxuriance of Mrs. <HI>Rowe.</HI> This, however, is not all their prai&s;e; they have laboured to add to her brightne&s;s of imagery, her purity of &s;entiments. The poets have had Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> before their eyes; a writer, who, if he &s;tood not in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of genius, compen&s;ated that defect by a ready application of his powers to the promotion of piety. The attempt to employ the ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion, was, I think, fir&s;t made by Mr. <HI>Boyle's Martyrdom of Theodora;</HI> but <HI>Boyle's</HI> philo&s;ophical
<PB N="172" REF="203" MS="y"> &s;tudies did not allow him time for the cultivation of &s;tyle; and the completion of the great de&s;ign was re&s;erved for Mrs. <HI>Rowe.</HI> Dr. Watts was one of the fir&s;t who taught the Di&s;&s;enters to write and &s;peak like other men, by &s;hewing them that elegance might con&s;i&s;t with piety. They would have both done honour to a better &s;ociety, for they had that charity which might well make their failings be forgotten, and with which the whole Chri&s;tian world might wi&s;h for communion. They were pure from all the here&s;ies of an age, to which every opinion is become a favourite that the univer&s;al church has hitherto dete&s;ted!</Q></P>
<P><Q>"This prai&s;e, the general intere&s;t of mankind requires to be given to writers who plea&s;e and do not corrupt, who in&s;truct and do not weary. But to them all human eulogies are vain, whom I believe applauded by angels, and num|bered with the ju&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>His defence of tea again&s;t Mr. Jonas Hanway's violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, &s;hews how very well a man of genius can write upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ubject, when he writes, as the Italians &s;ay, <HI>can amore:</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e no per&s;on ever enjoyed with more reli&s;h the infu&s;ion of that fragrant leaf than John&s;on. The quantities which he drank of it at all hours were &s;o great, that his nerves mu&s;t have been uncommonly &s;trong, not to have been extremely relaxed by &s;uch an intemperate u&s;e of it. He a&s;&s;ured me, that he never felt the lea&s;t inconvenience from it; which is a proof that the fault of his con&s;ti|tution was rather a too great ten&s;ion of fibres, than the contrary. Mr. Hanway wrote an angry an&s;wer to John&s;on's review of his E&s;&s;ay on Tea, and John&s;on, after a full and deliberate pau&s;e, made a reply to it; the only in&s;tance, I believe, in the whole cour&s;e of his life, when he conde&s;cended to oppo&s;e any thing that was written again&s;t him. I &s;uppo&s;e when he thought of any of his little antagoni&s;ts, he was ever ju&s;tly aware of the high &s;entiment of Ajax in Ovid:
<Q><L>"I&s;te tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus,</L>
<L>"Qui, c&ugrave;m victus erit, mecum certa&s;&s;e feretur."</L></Q>
But, indeed, the good Mr. Hanway laid him&s;elf &s;o open to ridicule, that John&s;on's animadver&s;ions upon his attack were chiefly to make &s;port.</P>
<P>The genero&s;ity with which he pleads the cau&s;e of Admiral Byng is highly to the honour of his heart and &s;pirit. Though <HI>Voltaire</HI> affects to be witty upon the fate of that unfortunate officer, ob&s;erving that he was &s;hot <Q REND="inline"><HI>"pour encourager les autres,"</HI></Q> the nation has long been &s;atisfied that his life was &s;acrificed

<P>John&s;on's mo&s;t exqui&s;ite critical e&s;&s;ay in the Literary Magazine, and indeed any where, is his review of Soame Jennings's <Q REND="inline">"Inquiry into the Origin of Evil."</Q> Jennings was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lively talents, and a &s;tyle eminently pure and ea&s;y, and could very happily play with a light &s;ubject, either in pro&s;e or ver&s;e; but when he &s;peculated on that mo&s;t difficult and excruciating que&s;tion, the Origin of Evil, he <Q REND="inline">"ventured far beyond his depth,"</Q> and, accordingly, was expo&s;ed by John&s;on, both with acute argument and brilliant wit. I remem|ber when the late Mr. Bicknell's humourous performance, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Mu&s;ical Travels of Joel Collyer,"</Q> in which a &s;light attempt is made to ridicule John&s;on, was a&s;cribed to Soame Jennings, <Q REND="inline">"Ha!

It a&s;&s;umed, as characteri&s;ticks of him, all the vulgar circum&s;tances of abu&s;e which had circulated among&s;t the ignorant. It was an unbecoming indulgence of puny re&s;entment, at a time when he him&s;elf was at a very advanced age, and had a near pro&s;pect of de&s;cending to the grave. I was truly &s;orry for it; for he was then become an avowed, and (as my Lord Bi&s;hop of London, who had a &s;erious conver&s;ation with him on the &s;ubject, a&s;&s;ures me) a &s;incere Chri&s;tian. He could not expect that John&s;on's numerous friends would patiently bear to have the memory of their ma&s;ter &s;tigmatized by no mean pen, but that at lea&s;t one would be found to retort. Accordingly, this unju&s;t and &s;arca&s;tick Epitaph was met in the &s;ame publick field by an an&s;wer, in terms by no means &s;oft, and &s;uch as wanton provocation only could ju&s;tify:</P>

<P>This year Mr. William Payne, brother of the re&s;pectable book&s;eller of that name, publi&s;hed <Q REND="inline">"An Introduction to the Game of Draughts,"</Q> to which John&s;on contributed a Dedication to the Earl of Rochford, * and a Preface, * both of which are admirably adapted to the treati&s;e to which they are prefixed. John&s;on, I believe, did not play at draughts after leaving College, by which he &s;uffered, for it would have afforded him an innocent &s;oothing relief from the melancholy which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him &s;o often. I have heard him regret that he had not learnt to play at cards; and the game of draughts we know is pecu|liarly calculated to fix the attention without &s;training it. There is a compo&s;ure and gravity in draughts which in&s;en&s;ibly tranquilli&s;es the mind; and, accord|ingly, the Dutch are fond of it, as they are of &s;moaking, of the &s;edative
<PB N="175" REF="206" MS="y">
influence of which, though he him&s;elf never &s;moaked, he had a high opinion <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 48.</NOTE>.  Be&s;ides, there is in draughts &s;ome exerci&s;e of the faculties; and, accordingly, John&s;on wi&s;hing to dignify the &s;ubject in his Dedication with what is mo&s;t e&s;timable in it, ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"Triflers may find or make any thing a trifle; but &s;ince it is the great characteri&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a wi&s;e man to &s;ee events in their cau&s;es, to obviate con&s;equences, and a&s;certain contingencies, your Lord&s;hip will think nothing a trifle by which the mind is inured to caution, fore&s;ight, and cir|cum&s;pection."</Q></P>
<P>As one of the little occa&s;ional advantages which he did not di&s;dain to take by his pen, as a man who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was literature, he this year accepted of a guinea from Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley, for writing the introduction to <Q REND="inline">"The London Chronicle,"</Q> an evening new&s;paper; and even in &s;o &s;light a per|formance exhibited peculiar talents. This Chronicle &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and from what I ob&s;erved, when I was abroad, has a more exten&s;ive circulation upon the Continent than any of the Engli&s;h new&s;papers. It was con&s;tantly read by John&s;on him&s;elf; and it is but ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that it has all along been di&s;|tingui&s;hed for good &s;en&s;e, accuracy, moderation, and delicacy.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the &s;ame nature has been communicated to me by the Reverend Dr. Thomas Campbell, who has done him&s;elf con&s;iderable credit by his own writings. <Q REND="inline">"Sitting with Dr. John&s;on one morning alone, he a&s;ked me if I had known Dr. Madden, who was authour of the premium-&s;cheme in Ireland. On my an&s;wering in the affirmative, and al&s;o that I had for &s;ome years lived in his neighbourhood, &amp;c. he begged of me that when I returned to Ireland, I would endeavour to procure for him a poem of Dr. Madden's, called 'Boulter's Monument.' The rea&s;on (&s;aid he) why I wi&s;h for it, is this: when Dr. Madden came to London, he &s;ubmitted that work to my ca&s;tigation; and I remember I blotted a great many lines, and might have blotted many more, without making the poem the wor&s;e. However, the Doctor was very thankful, and very generous, for he gave me ten guineas, <HI>which was to me at that time a great &s;um."</HI></Q></P>
<P>He this year re&s;umed his &s;cheme of giving an edition of Shak&s;peare with notes. He i&s;&s;ued Propo&s;als of con&s;iderable length, in which he &s;hewed that he perfectly well knew what a variety of re&s;earch &s;uch an undertaking required; but his indolence prevented him from pur&s;uing it with that diligence which alone can collect tho&s;e &s;cattered facts that genius, however acute, penetrating, and luminous, cannot di&s;cover by its own force. It is remarkable, that at
<PB N="176" REF="207" MS="y">
 this time his fancied activity was for the moment &s;o vigorous, that he promi&s;ed his work &s;hould be publi&s;hed before Chri&s;tmas, 1757. Yet nine years elap&s;ed before it &s;aw the light. His throes in bringing it forth had been &s;evere and remittent, and at la&s;t we may almo&s;t conclude that the Cae&s;arian operation was performed by the knife of Churchill, who&s;e upbraiding &s;atire, I dare &s;ay, made John&s;on's friends urge him to di&s;patch.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>About this period he was offered a living of con&s;iderable value in Lincoln|&s;hire, if he were inclined to enter into holy orders. It was a rectory in the gift of Mr. Langton, the father of his much valued friend. But he did not accept of it; partly I believe from a con&s;cientious motive, being per&s;uaded that his temper and habits rendered him unfit for that a&s;&s;iduous and familiar in&s;truction of the vulgar and ignorant, which he held to be an e&s;&s;ential duty in a clergyman; and partly becau&s;e his love of a London life was &s;o &s;trong, that he would have thought him&s;elf an exile in any other place, particularly if re&s;iding in the country. Whoever would wi&s;h to &s;ee his thoughts upon that &s;ubject di&s;played in their full force, may peru&s;e the Adventurer, No. 126.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately, by the favour of Mr. Faulkner, &s;een your account of Ireland, and cannot forbear to &s;olicit a pro&s;ecution of your de&s;ign. Sir William Temple complains that Ireland is le&s;s known than any other country, as to its ancient &s;tate. The natives have had little lei&s;ure, and little encourage|ment for enquiry; and &s;trangers, not knowing the language, have had no ability.</P>
<P>I have long wi&s;hed that the Iri&s;h literature were cultivated. Ireland is known by tradition to have been once the &s;eat of piety and learning; and &s;urely it would be very acceptable to all tho&s;e who are curious either in the original of nations, or the affinities of Languages, to be further informed of the revolutions of a people &s;o ancient, and once &s;o illu&s;trious.</P>
<P>What relation there is between the Welch and Iri&s;h languages, or between the language of Ireland and that of Bi&s;cay, de&s;erves enquiry. Of the&s;e pro|vincial and unextended tongues, it &s;eldom happens that more than one are under&s;tood by any one man; and, therefore, it &s;eldom happens that a fair compari&s;on can be made. I hope you will continue to cultivate this kind of learning, which has lain too long neglected, and which, if it be &s;uffered to remain in oblivion for another century, may, perhaps, never be retrieved. As I wi&s;h well to all u&s;eful undertakings, I would not forbear to let you know how much you de&s;erve, in my opinion, from all lovers of &s;tudy, and how much plea&s;ure your work has given to, Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Dr. Burney has kindly favoured me with the following memorandum, which I take the liberty to in&s;ert in his own genuine ea&s;y &s;tyle. I love to exhibit &s;ketches of my illu&s;trious friend by various eminent hands.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Soon after this, Mr. Burney, during a vi&s;it to the capital, had an inter|view with him in Gough-&s;quare, where he dined and drank tea with him, and was introduced to the acquaintance of Mrs. Williams. After dinner, Mr. John&s;on propo&s;ed to Mr. Burney to go up with him into his garret, which being accepted, he there found about five or &s;ix Greek folios, a deal writing|de&s;k, and a chair and a half. John&s;on giving to his gue&s;t the entire &s;eat, tottered him&s;elf on one with only three legs and one arm. Here he gave Mr. Burney Mrs. Williams's hi&s;tory, and &s;hewed him &s;ome volumes of his Shak|&s;peare already printed, to prove that he was in earne&s;t. Upon Mr. Burney's opening the fir&s;t volume, at the Merchant of Venice, he ob&s;erved to him, that he &s;eemed to be more &s;evere on Warburton than Theobald. 'O poor Tib.! (&s;aid John&s;on) he was ready knocked down to my hands; Warburton &s;tands between me and him.' 'But, Sir, (&s;aid Mr. Burney,) you'll have Warburton upon your bones, won't you?' 'No, Sir; he'll not come out: he'll only growl in his den.' 'But you think, Sir, that Warburton is a &s;upe|riour critick to Theobald?'&mdash;'O, Sir, he'd make two-and-fifty Theobalds, cut into &s;lices! The wor&s;t of Warburton is, that he has a rage for &s;aying &s;ome|thing, when there's nothing to be &s;aid.'&mdash;Mr. Burney then a&s;ked him whether he had &s;een the letter which Warburton had written in an&s;wer to a pamphlet addre&s;&s;ed 'To the mo&s;t impudent Man alive.' He an&s;wered in the negative. Mr. Burney told him it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by Mallet. The contro|ver&s;y now raged between the friends of Pope and Bolingbroke; and Warburton and Mallet were the leaders of the &s;everal parties. Mr. Burney a&s;ked him then
<PB N="181" REF="212" MS="y">
if he had &s;een Warburton's book again&s;t Bolingbroke's Philo&s;ophy? 'No,  Sir; I have never read Bolingbroke's impiety, and therefore am not intere&s;ted about its confutation."</Q></P>
<P>On the fifteenth of April he began a new periodical paper, entitled <Q REND="inline">"THE IDLER, *"</Q> which came out every Saturday in a weekly new&s;paper, called <Q REND="inline">"The Univer&s;al Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette,"</Q> publi&s;hed by Newberry. The&s;e e&s;&s;ays were continued till April 5, 1760. Of one hundred and three, their total number, twelve were contributed by his friends; of which, Numbers 33, 93, and 96, were written by Mr. Thomas Warton; No. 67 by Mr. Langton; and No. 76, 79, and 82 by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds; the concluding words of No. 82, <Q REND="inline">"and pollute his canvas with deformity,"</Q> being added by John&s;on, as Sir Jo&s;hua informed me.</P>
<P>The IDLER is evidently the work of the &s;ame mind which produced the RAMBLER, but has le&s;s body, and more &s;pirit. It has more variety of real life, and greater facility of language. He de&s;cribes the mi&s;eries of idlene&s;s, with the lively &s;en&s;ations of one who had felt them; and in his private memo|randums while engaged in it, we find <Q REND="inline">"This year I hope to learn diligence <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 30.</NOTE>."</Q> Many of the&s;e excellent e&s;&s;ays were written as ha&s;tily as an ordinary letter. Mr. Langton remembers John&s;on, when on a vi&s;it at Oxford, a&s;king him one evening how long it was till the po&s;t went out; and on being told about half an hour, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"then we &s;hall do very well."</Q> He upon this in&s;tantly fat down and fini&s;hed an Idler, which it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be in London the next day. Mr. Langton having &s;ignified a wi&s;h to read it, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) you &s;hall not do more than I have done my&s;elf."</Q> He then folded it up, and &s;ent it off.</P>
<P>Yet there are in the Idler &s;everal papers which &s;hew as much profundity of thought, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">our of language, as any of this great man's writings. No. 14, <Q REND="inline">"Robbery of time;"</Q> No. 24, <Q REND="inline">"Thinking;"</Q> No. 41, <Q REND="inline">"Death of a friend;"</Q> No. 43, <Q REND="inline">"Flight of time;"</Q> No. 51, <Q REND="inline">"Dome&s;tick greatne&s;s unattainable;"</Q> No. 52, <Q REND="inline">"Self-denial;"</Q> No. 58, <Q REND="inline">"Actual, how &s;hort of fancied excellence;"</Q> No. 89, <Q REND="inline">"Phy&s;ical evil moral good;"</Q> and his concluding paper on <Q REND="inline">"The horrour of the la&s;t,"</Q> will prove this a&s;&s;ertion. I know not why a motto, the u&s;ual trapping of periodical papers, is prefixed to very few of the Idlers, as I have heard John&s;on commend the cu&s;tom; and he never could be at a lo&s;s for one, his memory being &s;tored with innumerable pa&s;&s;ages of the cla&s;&s;icks. In this &s;eries of e&s;&s;ays he exhibits admirable in&s;tances of grave humour, of which he had
<PB N="182" REF="213" MS="y">
 an uncommon &s;hare. Nor on &s;ome occa&s;ions has he repre&s;&s;ed that power of &s;ophi&s;try which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o eminent a degree. In No. 11, he treats with the utmo&s;t contempt the opinion that our mental f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">culties depend, in &s;ome degree, upon the weather; an opinion, which they who have never experienced its truth are not to be envied, and of which he him&s;elf could not but be &s;en&s;ible, as the effects of weather upon him were very vi&s;ible. Yet thus he declaims: <Q REND="inline">"Surely, nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with rea&s;on, than to re&s;ign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in depen|dance on the weather and the wind for the only ble&s;&s;ings which Nature has put into our power, tranquillity and benevolence.&mdash;This di&s;tinction of &s;ea&s;ons is produced only by imagination operating on luxury. To temperance, every day is bright; and every hour is propitious to diligence. He that &s;hall re&s;o|lutely excite his faculties, or exert his virtues, will &s;oon make him&s;elf &s;uperiour to the &s;ea&s;ons; and may &s;et at defiance the morning mi&s;t and the evening damp, the bla&s;ts of the ea&s;t, and the clouds of the &s;outh."</Q></P>
<P>Alas! it is too certain, that where the frame has delicate fibres, and there is a fine &s;en&s;ibility, &s;uch influences of the air are irre&s;i&s;tible. He might as well have bid defiance to the ague, the pal&s;y, and all other bodily di&s;orders. Such boa&s;ting of the force of mind is fal&s;e elevation.
<Q><L>"I think the Romans call it Stoici&s;m."</L></Q>
But in this number of his Idler his &s;pirits &s;eem to run riot; for in the wanton|ne&s;s of his di&s;qui&s;ition he forgets, for a moment, even the reverence for that which he held in high re&s;pect; and de&s;cribes <Q REND="inline">"the attendant on a <HI>Court,"</HI></Q> as one <Q REND="inline">"who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to watch the looks of a being, weak and fooli&s;h as him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>His unqualified ridicule of rhetorical ge&s;ture or action is not, &s;urely, a te&s;t of truth; yet we cannot help admiring how well it is adapted to produce the effect which he wi&s;hed. <Q REND="inline">"Neither the judges of our laws, nor the repre|&s;entatives of our people, would be much affected by laboured ge&s;ticulation, or believe any man the more becau&s;e he rolled his eyes, or puffed his cheeks, or &s;pread abroad his arms, or &s;tamped the ground, or thumped his brea&s;t, or turned his eyes &s;ometimes to the cieling, and &s;ometimes to the floor."</Q></P>
<P>A ca&s;ual coincidence with other writers, or an adoption of a &s;entiment or image which has been found in the writings of another, and afterwards appears in the mind as one's own, is not unfrequent. The richne&s;s of John&s;on's fancy, which could &s;upply his page abundantly on all occa&s;ions, and the &s;trength of his memory, which at once detected the real owner of any thought, made him le&s;s liable to the imputation of plagiari&s;m than, perhaps, any of our
<PB N="183" REF="214" MS="y">
writers. In the Idler, however, there is a paper, in which conver&s;ation is a&s;&s;imilated to a bowl of punch, where there is the &s;ame train of compari&s;on as in a poem by Blacklock, in his collection publi&s;hed in 1756; in which a parallel is ingeniou&s;ly drawn between human life and that liquor. It ends,</P>

<L>"Who cure the body or the mind,</L>
<L>"What harm in drinking can there be,</L>
<L>"Since punch and life &s;o well agree?"</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>To the Idler, when collected in volumes, he added (be&s;ide the E&s;&s;ay on Epitaphs, and the Di&s;&s;ertation on tho&s;e of Pope,) an E&s;&s;ay on the Bravery of the Engli&s;h common Soldiers.</P>

<P>YOUR notes upon my poet were very acceptable. I beg that you will be &s;o kind as to continue your &s;earches. It will be reputable to my work, and &s;uitable to your profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, to have &s;omething of yours in the notes. As you have given no directions about your name, I &s;hall therefore put it. I wi&s;h your brother would take the &s;ame trouble. A commentary mu&s;t ari&s;e from the fortuitous di&s;coveries of many men in devious walks of literature. Some of your remarks are on plays already printed: but I purpo&s;e to add an Appendix of Notes, &s;o that nothing comes too late.</P>
<P>You give your&s;elf too much unea&s;ine&s;s, dear Sir, about the lo&s;s of the papers <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Receipts for Shak&s;peare."</Q></NOTE>. The lo&s;s is nothing, if nobody has found them; nor even then, perhaps, if the numbers be known. You are not the only friend that has had the &s;ame mi&s;chance. You may repair your want out of a &s;tock, which is depo&s;ited with Mr. Allen, of Magdalen-Hall; or out of a parcel which I have ju&s;t &s;ent to Mr. Chambers <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Then of Lincoln College.

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1759">
<P><MILESTONE N="1759"> In 1759, in the month of January, his mother died, at the great age of ninety, an event which deeply affected him, not that <Q REND="inline">"his mind had acquired no firmne&s;s by the contemplation of mortality <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hawkins's Life of John&s;on, p. 365.</NOTE>,"</Q> but that his reverential affection for her was not abated by years, as indeed he retained all his tender feelings even to the late&s;t period of his life. I have been told that he regretted much his not having gone to vi&s;it his mother for &s;everal years previous to her death. But he was con&s;tantly engaged in literary labours, which confined him to London; and though he had not the comfort of &s;eeing his aged parent, he contributed liberally to her &s;upport.</P>
<P>Soon after this event, he wrote his <Q REND="inline">"RASSELAS, PRINCE OF ABYSSINIA; *"</Q> concerning the publication of which Sir John Hawkins gue&s;&s;es vaguely and idly, in&s;tead of having taken the trouble to inform him&s;elf with authentick pre|ci&s;ion. Not to trouble my readers with a repetition of the Knight's reveries, I have to mention, that the late Mr. Strahan the printer told me, that John&s;on
<PB N="185" REF="216" MS="y">
wrote it, that with the profits he might defray the expence of his mother's <MILESTONE N="1759. Aetat. 50."> funeral, and pay &s;ome little debts which &s;he had left. He told Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds that he compo&s;ed it in the evenings of one week, &s;ent it to the pre&s;s in portions as it was written, and had never &s;ince read it over. Mr. Strahan, Mr. John&s;ton, and Mr. Dod&s;ley purcha&s;ed it for a hundred pounds, but after|wards paid him twenty-five pounds more when it came to a &s;econd edition.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the large &s;ums which have been received for compilations, and works requiring not much more genius than compilations, we cannot but wonder at the very low price which he was content to receive for this admirable performance, which, though he had written nothing el&s;e, would have rendered his name immortal in the world of literature. None of his writings has been &s;o exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed over Europe; for it has been tran&s;lated into mo&s;t, if not all, of the modern languages. This Tale, with all the charms of oriental imagery, and all the force and beauty of which the Engli&s;h language is capable, leads us through the mo&s;t important &s;cenes of human life, and &s;hews us that this &s;tage of our being is full of <Q REND="inline">"vanity and vexation of &s;pirit."</Q> To tho&s;e who look no further than the pre&s;ent life, or who maintain that human nature has not fallen from the &s;tate in which it was created, the in&s;truction of this &s;ublime &s;tory will be of no avail. But they who think ju&s;tly, and feel with &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility, will li&s;ten with eagerne&s;s and admiration to its truth and wi&s;dom. Voltaire's CANDIDE, written to refute the &s;y&s;tem of Optimi&s;m, which it has accompli&s;hed with brilliant &s;ucce&s;s, is wonderfully &s;imilar in its plan and conduct to John&s;on's RASSELAS; in&s;omuch, that I have heard John&s;on &s;ay, that if they had not been publi&s;hed &s;o clo&s;ely one after the other that there was not time for imitation, it would have been in vain to deny that the &s;cheme of that which came late&s;t was taken from the other. Though the propo&s;ition illu&s;trated by both the&s;e works was the &s;ame, namely, that in our pre&s;ent &s;tate there is more evil than good, the intention of the writers was very different. Voltaire, I am afraid, meant only by wanton profanene&s;s to obtain a &s;portive victory over religion, and to di&s;credit the belief of a &s;uper|intending Providence: John&s;on meant, by &s;hewing the un&s;atisfactory nature of things temporal, to direct the hopes of man to things eternal. Ra&s;&s;elas, as was ob&s;erved to me by a very accompli&s;hed lady, may be con&s;idered as a more enlarged and more deeply philo&s;ophical di&s;cour&s;e in pro&s;e, upon the intere&s;ting truth, which in his <Q REND="inline">"Vanity of human Wi&s;hes"</Q> he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully enforced in ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The fund of thinking which this work contains is &s;uch, that almo&s;t every &s;entence of it may furni&s;h a &s;ubject of long meditation. I am not &s;atisfied if a
<PB N="186" REF="217" MS="y">
 year pa&s;&s;es without my having read it through; and at every peru&s;al, my admiration of the mind which produced it is &s;o highly rai&s;ed, that I can &s;carcely believe that I had the honour of enjoying the intimacy of &s;uch a man.</P>
<P>I re&s;train my&s;elf from quoting pa&s;&s;ages from this excellent work, or even referring to them, becau&s;e I &s;hould not know what to &s;elect, or, rather, what to omit. I &s;hall, however, tran&s;cribe one, as it &s;hews how well he could &s;tate the arguments of tho&s;e who believe in the appearance of departed &s;pirits, a doctrine which it is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that he him&s;elf ever po&s;itively held.</P>
<Q><P>If all your fear be of apparitions, (&s;aid the Prince,) I will promi&s;e you &s;afety: there is no danger from the dead; he that is once buried will be &s;een no more.</P>
<P>That the dead are &s;een no more (&s;aid Imlac,) I will not undertake to maintain again&s;t the concurrent and unvaried te&s;timony of all ages, and of all nations. There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed. This opinion, which prevails as far as human nature is diffu&s;ed, could become univer&s;al only by its truth; tho&s;e that never heard of one another, would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible. That it is doubted by &s;ingle cavillers, can very little weaken the general evidence; and &s;ome who deny it with their tongues, confe&s;s it by their fears.</P></Q>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the high admiration of Ra&s;&s;elas, I will not maintain that the <Q REND="inline">"morbid melancholy"</Q> in John&s;on's con&s;titution may not, perhaps, have made life appear to him more in&s;ipid and unhappy than it generally is; for I am &s;ure that he had le&s;s enjoyment from it than I have. Yet, whatever additional &s;hade his own particular &s;en&s;ations may have thrown on his repre|&s;entation of life, attentive ob&s;ervation and clo&s;e inquiry have convinced me, that there is too much of reality in the gloomy picture. The truth, however, is, that we judge of the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of life differently at different times, according to the &s;tate of our changeable frame. I always remember a remark made to me by a Turki&s;h lady, educated in France, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Ma foi, Mon&s;ieur, notre bonheur depend du fa&ccedil;on que notre &s;ang circule."</HI></Q> This have I learnt from a pretty hard cour&s;e of experience, and would, from &s;incere benevolence, impre&s;s upon all who honour this book with a peru&s;al, that until a &s;teady conviction is obtained, that the pre&s;ent life is an imperfect &s;tate, and only a pa&s;&s;age to a better, if we comply with the divine &s;cheme of progre&s;|&s;ive improvement; and al&s;o that it is a part of the my&s;terious plan of Provi|dence, that intellectual beings mu&s;t <Q REND="inline">"be made perfect through &s;uffering;"</Q> there will be a continual recurrence of di&s;appointment and unea&s;ine&s;s. But
<PB N="187" REF="218" MS="y">
if we walk with hope in <Q REND="inline">"the mid-day &s;un"</Q> of revelation, our temper and di&s;po&s;ition will be &s;uch, that the comforts and enjoyments in our way will be reli&s;hed, while we patiently &s;upport the inconveniencies and pains. After much &s;peculation and various rea&s;onings, I acknowledge my&s;elf convinced of the truth of Voltaire's conclu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Apres tout c'e&s;t un monde pa&s;&s;able."</HI></Q> But we mu&s;t not think too deeply:
<Q><L>"Where ignorance is bli&s;s, 'tis folly to be wi&s;e,"</L></Q>

<P>The effect of Ra&s;&s;elas, and of John&s;on's other moral tales, is thus beauti|fully illu&s;trated by Mr. Courtenay:</P>

<P>It will be recollected, that during all this year he carried on his IDLER <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>This paper was in &s;uch high e&s;timation before it was collected into volumes, that it was &s;eized on with avidity by various publi&s;hers of new&s;papers and magazines, to enrich their publications.

<P><Q REND="inline">"London, January 5, 1759. Adverti&s;ement. The proprietors of the paper entitled 'The Idler,' having found that tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays are in&s;erted in the new&s;papers and magazines with &s;o little regard to ju&s;tice or decency, that the Univer&s;al Chronicle, in which they fir&s;t appear, is not always mentioned, think it nece&s;&s;ary to declare to the publi&s;hers of tho&s;e collections, that however patiently they have hitherto endured the&s;e injuries, made yet more injurious by contempt, they have now determined to endure them no longer. They have already &s;een e&s;&s;ays, for which a very large price is paid, transferred, with the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s rapacity, into the weekly or monthly compila|tions, and their right, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, alienated from them, before they could them&s;elves be &s;aid to enjoy it. But they would not willingly be thought to want tenderne&s;s, even for men by whom no tenderne&s;s hath been &s;hewn. The pa&s;t is without remedy, and &s;hall be without re&s;entment. But tho&s;e who have been thus bu&s;y with their &s;ickles in the fields of their neighbours, are henceforward to take notice, that the time of impunity is at an end. Whoever &s;hall, without our leave, lay the hand of rapine upon our papers, is to expect that we &s;hall vindicate our due, by the means which ju&s;tice pre&s;cribes, and which are warranted by the immemorial pre&s;criptions of honourable trade.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR father's inexorability not only grieves but amazes me: he is your father: he was always accounted a wi&s;e man; nor do I remember any thing to the di&s;advantage of his good nature; but in his refu&s;al to a&s;&s;i&s;t you there is neither good-nature, fatherhood, nor wi&s;dom. It is the practice of good-nature to overlook faults which have already, by the con&s;equences, puni&s;hed the delinquent. It is natural for a father to think more favourably than others of his children; and it is always wife to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance while a little help will prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of greater.</P>
<P>If you married imprudently, you mi&s;carried at your own hazard, at an age when you had a right of choice. It would be hard if the man might not choo&s;e his own wife, who has a right to plead before the Judges of his country.</P>
<P>If your imprudence has ended in difficulties and inconveniences, you are your&s;elf to &s;upport them; and, with the help of a little better health, you would &s;upport them and conquer them. Surely, that want which accident and &s;ickne&s;s produces, is to be &s;upported in every region of humanity, though there were neither friends nor fathers in the world. You have certainly from your father the highe&s;t claim of charity, though none of right; and therefore
<PB N="189" REF="220" MS="y">
I would coun&s;el you to omit no decent nor manly degree of importunity. Your debts in the whole are not large, and of the whole but a &s;mall part is trouble|&s;ome. Small debts are like &s;mall &s;hot; they are rattling on every &s;ide, and can &s;carcely be e&s;caped without a wound: great debts are like cannon; of loud noi&s;e, but little danger. You mu&s;t, therefore, be enabled to di&s;charge petty debts, that you may have lei&s;ure, with &s;ecurity, to &s;truggle with the re&s;t. Neither the great nor little debts di&s;grace you. I am &s;ure you have my e&s;teem for the courage with which you contracted them, and the &s;pirit with which you endure them. I wi&s;h my e&s;teem could be of more u&s;e. I have been invited, or have invited my&s;elf, to &s;everal parts of the kingdom; and will not incommode my dear Lucy by coming to Lichfield, while her pre&s;ent lodging is of any u&s;e to her. I hope in a few days to be at lei&s;ure, and to make vi&s;its. Whither I &s;hall fly is matter of no importance. A man uncon|nected is at home every where; unle&s;s he may be &s;aid to be at home no where. I am &s;orry, dear Sir, that where you have parents, a man of your merits &s;hould not have an home.

<P>Mr. Wilkes, who upon all occa&s;ions has acted, as a private gentleman, with mo&s;t polite liberality, applied to his friend Sir George Hay, then one of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty; and Francis Barber was di&s;charged, as he has told me, without any wi&s;h of his own.

At this time there being a competition among the architects of London to be employed in the building of Blackfriars-bridge, a que&s;tion was very warmly agitated whether &s;emicircular or elliptical arches were preferable. In the de&s;ign offered by Mr. Mylne the elliptical form was adopted, and there|fore it was the great object of his rivals to attack it. John&s;on's regard for his friend Mr. Gwyn induced him to engage in this controver&s;y again&s;t Mr. Mylne <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>Sir John Hawkins has given a long detail of it, in that manner vulgarly, but &s;ignificantly, called <HI>rigmarole;</HI> in which, amid&s;t an o&s;tentatious exhibition of arts and arti&s;ts, he talks of <Q REND="inline">"pro|portions of a column being taken from that of the human figure, and <HI>adju&s;ted by Nature</HI>&mdash;ma&s;cu|line and feminine&mdash;in a man, <HI>&s;e&s;quioctave</HI> of the head, and in a woman <HI>&s;e&s;quinonal;"</HI></Q> nor has he failed to introduce a jargon of mu&s;ical terms, which do not &s;eem much to corre&s;pond with the &s;ubject, but &s;erve to make up the heterogeneous ma&s;s. To follow the Knight through all this, would be an u&s;ele&s;s fatigue to my&s;elf, and not a little di&s;gu&s;ting to my readers. I &s;hall, therefore, only make a few remarks upon his &s;tatement.&mdash;He &s;eems to exult in having detected John&s;on in procuring <Q REND="inline">"from a per&s;on eminently &s;killed in mathematicks and the principles of architecture, an&s;wers to a &s;tring of que&s;tions drawn up by him&s;elf, touching the comparative &s;trength of &s;emi|circular and elliptical arches."</Q> Now I cannot conceive how John&s;on could have acted more wi&s;ely. Sir John complains that the opinion of that excellent mathematician, Mr. Thomas Simp&s;on, did not preponderate in favour of the &s;emicircular arch. But he &s;hould have known, that however eminent Mr. Simp&s;on was in the higher parts of ab&s;tract mathematical &s;cience, he was little ver&s;ed in mixed and practical mechanicks. Mr. Muller, of Woolwich Academy, the &s;chola&s;tick father of all the great engineers which this country has employed for forty years, decided the que&s;tion by declaring clearly in favour of the elliptical arch.</P>
<P>It is ungraciou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted, that John&s;on's motive for oppo&s;ing Mr. Mylne's &s;cheme may have been his prejudice again&s;t him as a native of North-Britain; when, in truth, as has been &s;tated, he gave the aid of his able pen to a friend, who was one of the candidates; and &s;o far was he from having any illiberal antipathy to Mr. Mylne, that he afterwards lived with that gentleman upon very agreeable terms of acquaintance, and dined with him at his hou&s;e. Sir John Hawkins, indeed, gives full vent to his own prejudice in abu&s;ing Blackfriars-bridge, calling it <Q REND="inline">"an edifice, in which beauty and &s;ymmetry are in vain &s;ought for; by which the citizens of London have perpetuated their own di&s;grace, and &s;ubjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners."</Q> Whoever has contemplated, <HI>placido lumine,</HI> this &s;tately, elegant, and airy &s;tructure, which has &s;o fine an effect, e&s;pecially on approaching the capital on that quarter, mu&s;t wonder at &s;uch unju&s;t and ill-tempered cen&s;ure; and I appeal to all foreigners of good ta&s;te, whether this bridge be not one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ornaments of London. As to the &s;tability of the fabrick, it is certain that the City of London took every precaution to have the be&s;t Port|land &s;tone for it; but as this is to be found in the quarries belonging to the publick, under the direction of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, it &s;o happened that parliamentary intere&s;t, which is often the bane of fair pur&s;uits, thwarted their endeavours. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;advantage, it is well known that not only has Blackfriars-bridge never &s;unk either in its foundations or in its arches, which were &s;o much the &s;ubject of conte&s;t, but any injuries which it has &s;uffered from the effects of &s;evere fro&s;ts have been already, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repaired with &s;ounder &s;tone, and every nece&s;&s;ary renewal can be completed at a moderate expence.</P></NOTE>; and after being at con&s;iderable pains to &s;tudy the &s;ubject, he wrote three &s;everal letters in the Gazetteer, in oppo&s;ition to his plan.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="223" MS="y">
 If it &s;hould be remarked that this was a controver&s;y which lay quite out of John&s;on's way, let it be remembered that after all, his employing his powers of rea&s;oning and eloquence upon a &s;ubject which he had &s;tudied on the moment, is not more &s;trange than what we often ob&s;erve in lawyers, who, as <HI>Quicquid agunt homines</HI> is the matter of law-&s;uits, are &s;ometimes obliged to pick up a temporary knowledge of an art or &s;cience, of which they under|&s;tood nothing till their brief was delivered, and appear to be much ma&s;ters of it. In like manner, members of the legi&s;lature frequently introduce and expatiate upon &s;ubjects of which they have informed them&s;elves for the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1760"> In 1760 he wrote <Q REND="inline">"An Addre&s;s of the Painters to George III. on his Ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the Throne of the&s;e Kingdoms, &dagger;"</Q> which no monarch ever a&s;cended with more &s;incere congratulations from his people.

<P>John&s;on was now either very idle, or very bu&s;y with his Shak&s;peare; for I can find no other publick compo&s;ition by him except an account which he gave in the Gentleman's Magazine of Mr. Tytler's acute and able vindi|cation of Mary Queen of Scots. * The genero&s;ity of John&s;on's feelings &s;hines forth in the following &s;entence: <Q REND="inline">"It has now been fa&s;hionable, for near half a century, to defame and vilify the hou&s;e of Stuart, and to exalt and magnify the reign of Elizabeth.

<P>In this year I have not di&s;covered a &s;ingle private letter written by him to any of his friends. It &s;hould &s;eem, however, that he had at this period a floating intention of writing a hi&s;tory of the recent and wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h arms in all quarters of the globe; for among his re&s;olutions or memorandums, September 18, there is, <Q REND="inline">"Send for books for Hi&s;t. of War <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 42.</NOTE>."</Q> How much is it to be regretted that this intention was not fulfilled.

<P>I take this opportunity to relate the manner in which an acquaintance fir&s;t commenced between Dr. John&s;on and Mr. Murphy. During the publica|tion of <Q REND="inline">"The Gray's-Inn Journal,"</Q> a periodical paper which was &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully carried on by Mr. Murphy alone, when a very young man, he happened to be in the country with Mr. Foote; and having mentioned that he was obliged to go to London in order to get ready for the pre&s;s one of the numbers of that Journal, Foote &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"You need not go on that account. Here is a French magazine, in which you will find a very pretty oriental tale; tran&s;late that, and &s;end it to your printer."</Q> Mr. Murphy having read the tale, was highly plea&s;ed with it, and followed Foote's advice. When he returned to town, this tale was pointed out to him in the Rambler, from whence it had been tran&s;lated into the French magazine. Mr. Murphy then waited upon John&s;on, to explain this curious incident. His talents, literature, and gentleman-like manners, were &s;oon perceived by John&s;on, and a friend&s;hip was formed which was never broken.</P>
<P>John&s;on, who was ever awake to the calls of humanity, wrote this year an Introduction* to the proceedings of the Committee for cloathing the French pri&s;oners.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1761">
<P><MILESTONE N="1761"> In 1761 John&s;on appears to have done little. He was &s;till, no doubt, pro|ceeding in his edition of Shak&s;peare; but what advances he made in it cannot be a&s;certained. He certainly was at this time not active; for in his &s;crupulous examination of him&s;elf on Ea&s;ter eve, he laments, in his too rigorous mode of cen&s;uring his own conduct, that his life, &s;ince the communion of the pre|ceding Ea&s;ter, had been <Q REND="inline">"di&s;&s;ipated and u&s;ele&s;s <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 44.</NOTE>."</Q> He, however, contributed this year the Preface* to <Q REND="inline">"Rolt's Dictionary of Trade and Commerce,"</Q> in which he di&s;plays &s;uch a clear and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of the &s;ubject, as might lead the reader to think that its authour had devoted all his life to it. I a&s;ked him, whether he knew much of Rolt, and of his work. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) I never &s;aw the man, and never read the book. The book&s;ellers wanted a Preface to a Dictionary of Trade and Commerce. I knew very well what &s;uch a Dictionary &s;hould be, and I wrote a Preface accordingly."</Q> Rolt, who wrote a great deal for the book&s;ellers, particularly a Hi&s;tory of the War, on which, as we have &s;een, John&s;on him&s;elf once had thoughts of employing his pen, was, as John&s;on told me, a &s;ingular character. Though not in the lea&s;t acquainted with him, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I am ju&s;t come from Sam. John&s;on."</Q> This was a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen of his vanity and impudence. But he gave a more
<PB N="195" REF="226" MS="y">
eminent proof of it in our &s;i&s;ter kingdom,&punc; as Dr. John&s;on informed me. When <MILESTONE N="1761. Aetat. 52."> Aken&s;ide's <Q REND="inline">"Plea&s;ures of the Imagination"</Q> fir&s;t came out, he did not put his name to the poem. Rolt went over to Dublin, publi&s;hed an edition of it, and put his own name to it. Upon the fame of this he lived for &s;everal months, being entertained at the be&s;t tables as <Q REND="inline">"the ingenious Mr. Rolt."</Q> His conver&s;ation, indeed, did not di&s;cover much of the fire of a poet; but it was recollected, that both Addi&s;on and Thom&s;on were equally dull till excited by wine. Aken&s;ide having been informed of this impo&s;ition, vindicated his right by publi&s;hing the poem with its real authour's name. Several in&s;tances of &s;uch literary fraud have been detected. The Reverend Dr. Campbell, of St. Andrew's, wrote a book on the authenticity of the Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory, the manu|&s;cript of which he &s;ent to Mr. Innys, a clergyman in England, who was his countryman and acquaintance. Innys publi&s;hed it with his own name to it; and before the impo&s;ition was di&s;covered, obtained con&s;iderable promotion, as a reward of his merit. The celebrated Dr. Hugh Blair, and his cou&s;in Mr. George Ballantine, when &s;tudents in divinity, wrote a poem, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Redemption,"</Q> copies of which were handed about in manu&s;cript. They were, at length, very much &s;urprized to &s;ee a pompous edition of it in folio, dedicated to the Queen, by a Dr. Douglas, as his own. Some years ago a little novel, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Man of Feeling,"</Q> was a&s;&s;umed by Mr. Eccles, a young Iri&s;h clergyman, who was afterwards drowned near Bath. He had been at the pains to tran&s;cribe the whole book, with blottings, interlineations, and corrections, that it might be &s;hewn to &s;everal people as an original. It was, in truth, the production of Mr. Henry Mackenzie, an attorney in the Exchequer at Edinburgh, who is the authour of &s;everal other ingenious pieces; but the belief with regard to Mr. Eccles became &s;o general, that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary for Me&s;&s;ieurs Strahan and Cadell to publi&s;h an adverti&s;ement in the new&s;papers, contradicting the report, and mentioning that they purcha&s;ed the copy right of Mr. Mackenzie. I can conceive this kind of fraud to be very ea&s;ily practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;sful effrontery. The <HI>filiation</HI> of a literary per|formance is difficult of proof; &s;eldom is there any witne&s;s pre&s;ent at its birth. A man, either in confidence or by improper means, obtains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a copy of it in manu&s;cript, and boldly publi&s;hes it as his own. The true authour, in many ca&s;es, may not be able to make his title clear. John&s;on, indeed, from the peculiar features of his literary offspring, might bid defiance to any attempt to appropriate them to others:
<Q><L>"But Shak&s;peare's magick could not copied be,</L>
<L>"Within that circle none dur&s;t walk but he."</L></Q></P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>JOSEPH BARETTI,</HI> at Milan.</HEAD>
<P>YOU reproach me very often with par&s;imony of writing: but you may di&s;cover by the extent of my paper, that I de&s;ign to recompence rarity by length. A &s;hort letter to a di&s;tant friend is, in my opinion, an in&s;ult like that of a &s;light bow or cur&s;ory &s;alutation;&mdash;a proof of unwillingne&s;s to do much, even where there is a nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething. Yet it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that he who continues the &s;ame cour&s;e of life in the &s;ame place, will have little to tell. One week and one year are very like another. The &s;ilent changes made by time are not always perceived; and if they are not perceived, cannot be recounted. I have ri&s;en and laid down, talked and mu&s;ed, while you have roved over a con&s;iderable part of Europe: yet I have not envied my Baretti any of his plea&s;ures, though, perhaps, I have envied others his com|pany; and I am glad to have other nations made acquainted with the charac|ter of the Engli&s;h, by a traveller who has &s;o nicely in&s;pected our manners, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;tudied our literature. I received your kind letter from Falmouth, in which you gave me notice of your departure for Li&s;bon; and another from Li&s;bon, in which you told me, that you were to leave Portugal in a few days. To either of the&s;e how could any an&s;wer be returned? I have had a third from Turin, complaining that I have not an&s;wered the former. Your Engli&s;h &s;tyle &s;till continues in its purity and vigour. With vigour your genius will &s;upply it; but its purity mu&s;t be continued by clo&s;e attention. To u&s;e two languages familiarly, and without contaminating one by the other, is very difficult; and to u&s;e more than two, is hardly to be hoped. The prai&s;es which &s;ome have received for their multiplicity of languages, may be &s;uf|ficient to excite indu&s;try, but can hardly generate confidence.</P>
<P>I know not whether I can heartily rejoice at the kind reception which you have found, or at the popularity to which you are exalted. I am willing that your merit &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed; but cannot wi&s;h that your affections may be gained. I would have you happy wherever you are: yet I would have you wi&s;h to return to England. If ever you vi&s;it us again, you will find the kind|ne&s;s of your friends undimini&s;hed. To tell you how many enquiries are made
<PB N="197" REF="228" MS="y">
after you, would be tedious, or if not tedious, would be vain; becau&s;e you may be told in a very few words, that all who knew you wi&s;h you well; and all that you embraced at your departure, will care&s;s you at your return: there|fore do not let Italian academicians nor Italian ladies drive us from your thoughts. You may find among us what you will leave behind, &s;oft &s;miles and ea&s;y &s;onnets. Yet I &s;hall not wonder if all our invitations &s;hould be rejected: for there is a plea&s;ure in being con&s;iderable at home, which is not ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>By conducting Mr. Southwell to Venice, you fulfilled, I know, the original contract: yet I would wi&s;h you not wholly to lo&s;e him from your notice, but to recommend him to &s;uch acquaintance as may be&s;t &s;ecure him from &s;uffering by his own follies, and to take &s;uch general care both of his &s;afety and his intere&s;t as may come within your power. His relations will thank you for any &s;uch gratuitous attention: at lea&s;t they will not blame you for any evil that may happen, whether they thank you or not for any good.</P>
<P>You know that we have a new King and a new Parliament. Of the new Parliament Fitzherbert is a member. We were &s;o weary of our old King, that we are much plea&s;ed with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; of whom we are &s;o much inclined to hope great things, that mo&s;t of us begin already to believe them. The young man is hitherto blamele&s;s; but it would be unrea&s;onable to expect much from the immaturity of juvenile years, and the ignorance of princely education. He has been long in the hands of the Scots, and has already favoured them more than the Engli&s;h will contentedly endure. But, perhaps, he &s;carcely knows whom he has di&s;tingui&s;hed, or whom he has di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Arti&s;ts have in&s;tituted a yearly exhibition of pictures and &s;tatues, in imitation, as I am told, of foreign Academies. This year was the &s;econd exhibition. They plea&s;e them&s;elves much with the multitude of &s;pectators, and imagine that the Engli&s;h &s;chool will ri&s;e in reputation. Reynolds is with|out a rival, and continues to add thou&s;ands to thou&s;ands, which he de&s;erves, among other excellencies, by retaining his kindne&s;s for Baretti. This exhi|bition has filled the heads of the Arti&s;ts and lovers of art. Surely life, if it be not long, is tedious, &s;ince we are forced to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o many trifles to rid us of our time, of that time which never can return.</P>
<P>I know my Baretti will not be &s;atisfied with a letter in which I give him no account of my&s;elf: yet what account &s;hall I give him? I have not, &s;ince the day of our &s;eparation, &s;uffered or done any thing con&s;iderable. The only change in my way of life is, that I have frequented the theatre more than in former &s;ea&s;ons. But I have gone thither only to e&s;cape from my&s;elf. We have had many new farces, and the comedy called 'The Jealous Wife,' which, though not written with much genius, was yet &s;o well adapted to the &s;tage,
<PB N="198" REF="229" MS="y">
 and &s;o well exhibited by the actors, that it was crowded for near twenty nights. I am digre&s;&s;ing from my&s;elf to the playhou&s;e; but a barren plan mu&s;t be filled with epi&s;odes. Of my&s;elf I have nothing to say, but that I have hitherto lived without the concurrence of my own judgement; yet I continue to flatter my&s;elf, that, when you return, you will find me mended. I do not wonder that, where the mona&s;tick life is permitted, every order finds votaries, and every mona&s;tery inhabitants. Men will &s;ubmit to any rule, by which they may be exempted from the tyranny of caprice and of chance. They are glad to &s;upply by external authority their own want of con&s;tancy and re&s;olution, and court the government of others, when long experience has convinced them of their own inability to govern them&s;elves. If I were to vi&s;it Italy, my curio&s;ity would be more attracted by convents than by palaces; though I am afraid that I &s;hould find expectation in both places equally di&s;appointed, and life in both places &s;upported with impatience and quitted with reluctance. That it mu&s;t be &s;o &s;oon quitted, is a powerful remedy again&s;t impatience; but what &s;hall free us from reluctance? Tho&s;e who have endeavoured to teach us to die well, have taught few to die willingly; yet I cannot but hope that a good life might end at la&s;t in a contented death.</P>
<P>You &s;ee to what a train of thought I am drawn by the mention of my|&s;elf. Let me now turn my attention upon you. I hope you take care to keep an exact journal, and to regi&s;ter all occurrences and ob&s;ervations; for your friends here expect &s;uch a book of travels as has not been often &s;een. You have given us good &s;pecimens in your letters from Li&s;bon. I wi&s;h you had &s;taid longer in Spain, for no country is le&s;s known to the re&s;t of Europe; but the quickne&s;s of your di&s;cernment mu&s;t make amends for the celerity of your motions. He that knows which way to direct his view, &s;ees much in a little time.</P>
<P>Write to me very often, and I will not neglect to write to you; and I may, perhaps, in time get &s;omething to write: at lea&s;t, you will know by my letters, whatever el&s;e they may have or want, that I continue to be</P>

<P>It is a melancholy con&s;ideration, that &s;o much of our time is nece&s;&s;arily to be &s;pent upon the care of living, and that we can &s;eldom obtain ea&s;e in one re&s;pect but by re&s;igning it in another; yet I &s;uppo&s;e we are by this di&s;pen&s;ation not le&s;s happy in the whole, than if the &s;pontaneous bounty of Nature poured all that we want into our hands. A few, if they were thus left to them&s;elves, would, perhaps, &s;pend their time in laudable pur&s;uits; but the greater part would prey upon the quiet of each other, or, in the want of other objects, would prey upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This, however, is our condition, which we mu&s;t improve and &s;olace as we can: and though we cannot choo&s;e always our place of re&s;idence, we may
<PB N="200" REF="231" MS="y">
 in every place find rational amu&s;ements, and po&s;&s;e&s;s in every place the comforts of piety and a pure con&s;cience.</P>
<P>In America there is little to be ob&s;erved except natural curio&s;ities. The new world mu&s;t have many vegetables and animals with which philo&s;ophers are but little acquainted. I hope you will furni&s;h your&s;elf with &s;ome books of natural hi&s;tory, and &s;ome gla&s;&s;es and other in&s;truments of ob&s;ervation. Tru&s;t as little as you can to report; examine all you can by your own &s;en&s;es. I do not doubt but you will be able to add much to knowledge, and, perhaps, to medicine. Wild nations tru&s;t to &s;imples; and, perhaps, the Peruvian bark is not the only &s;pecifick which tho&s;e exten&s;ive regions may afford us.</P>
<P>Wherever you are, and whatever be your fortune, be certain, dear Sir, that you carry with you my kind wi&s;hes; and that whether you return hither, or &s;tay in the other hemi&s;phere, to hear that you are happy will give plea&s;ure to, Sir,</P>

<P>I HOPE you will believe that my delay in an&s;wering your letter could proceed only from my unwillingne&s;s to de&s;troy any hope that you had formed. Hope is it&s;elf a &s;pecies of happine&s;s, and, perhaps, the chief hap|pine&s;s which this world affords: but, like all other plea&s;ures immoderately enjoyed, the exce&s;&s;es of hope mu&s;t be expiated by pain; and expectations improperly indulged, mu&s;t end in di&s;appointment. If it be a&s;ked, what is the improper expectation which it is dangerous to indulge, experience will quickly an&s;wer, that it is &s;uch expectation as is dictated not by rea&s;on, but by de&s;ire; expectation rai&s;ed, not by the common occurrences of life, but by the wants of the expectant; an expectation that requires the common cour&s;e of things to be changed, and the general rules of action to be broken.</P>

When you made your reque&s;t to me, you &s;hould have con&s;idered, Madam, what you were a&s;king.

I know, Madam, how unwillingly conviction is admitted, when intere&s;t oppo&s;es it; but &s;urely, Madam, you mu&s;t allow, that there is no rea&s;on why that &s;hould be done by me, which every other man may do with equal rea&s;on, and which, indeed, no man can do properly, without &s;ome very particular relation both to the Archbi&s;hop and to you. If I could help you in this exigence by any proper means, it would give me plea&s;ure; but this pro|po&s;al is &s;o very remote from all u&s;ual methods, that I cannot comply with it but at the ri&s;k of &s;uch an&s;wer and &s;u&s;picions as I believe you do not wi&s;h me to undergo.</P>

<P>HOWEVER ju&s;tly you may accu&s;e me for want of punctuality in corre&s;pondence, I am not &s;o far lo&s;t in negligence as to omit the oppor|tunity of writing to you, which Mr. Beauclerk's pa&s;&s;age through Milan affords me.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you received the Idlers, and I intend that you &s;hall &s;oon receive Shak&s;peare, that you may explain his works to the ladies of Italy, and tell them the &s;tory of the editor, among the other &s;trange narratives with which your long re&s;idence in this unknown region has &s;upplied you.</P>
<P>As you have now been long away, I &s;uppo&s;e your curio&s;ity may pant for &s;ome news of your old friends. Mi&s;s Williams and I live much as we did. Mi&s;s Cotterel &s;till continues to cling to Mrs. Porter, and Charlotte is now big of the fourth child. Mr. Reynolds gets &s;ix thou&s;ands a year. Levet is lately married, not without much &s;u&s;picion that he has been wretchedly cheated in
<PB N="202" REF="233">
 his match. Mr. Chambers is gone this day, for the fir&s;t time, the circuit with the Judges. Mr. Richard&s;on is dead of an apoplexy, and his &s;econd daughter has married a merchant.</P>
<P>My vanity, or my kindne&s;s, makes me flatter my&s;elf, that you would rather hear of me than of tho&s;e whom I have mentioned; but of my&s;elf I have very little which I care to tell. La&s;t winter I went down to my native town, where I found the &s;treets much narrower and &s;horter than I thought I had left them, inhabited by a new race of people, to whom I was very little known. My play-fellows were grown old, and forced me to &s;u&s;pect that I was no longer young. My only remaining friend has changed his principles, and was become the tool of the predominant faction. My daughter-in-law, from whom I expected mo&s;t, and whom I met with &s;incere benevolence, has lo&s;t the beauty and gaiety of youth, without having gained much of the wi&s;dom of age. I wandered about for five days, and took the fir&s;t convenient oppor|tunity of returning to a place, where, if there is not much happine&s;s, there is at lea&s;t &s;uch a diver&s;ity of good and evil, that &s;light vexations do not fix upon the heart <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">This is a very ju&s;t account of the relief which London affords to melancholy minds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I think in a few weeks to try another excur&s;ion; though to what end? Let me know, my Baretti, what has been the re&s;ult of your return to your own country: whether time has made any alteration for the better, and whether, when the fir&s;t raptures of &s;alutation were over, you did not find your thoughts confe&s;&s;ed their di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Moral &s;entences appear o&s;tentatious and tumid, when they have no greater occa&s;ions than the journey of a wit to his own town: yet &s;uch plea&s;ures and &s;uch pains make up the general ma&s;s of life; and as nothing is little to him that feels it with great &s;en&s;ibility, a mind able to &s;ee common incidents in their real &s;tate, is di&s;po&s;ed by very common incidents to very &s;erious contempla|tions. Let us tru&s;t that a time will come, when the pre&s;ent moment &s;hall be no longer irk&s;ome; when we &s;hall not borrow all our happine&s;s from hope, which at la&s;t is to end in di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>I beg that you will &s;hew Mr. Beauclerk all the civilities which you have in your power; for he has always been kind to me.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een Mr. Stratico, Profe&s;&s;or of Padua, who has told me of your quarrel with an Abbot of the Cele&s;tine order; but had not the particulars very ready in his memory. When you write to Mr. Mar&s;ili, let him know that I remember him with kindne&s;s.</P>

<P>YOU are not to &s;uppo&s;e, with all your conviction of my idlene&s;s, that I have pa&s;&s;ed all this time without writing to my Baretti. I gave a letter to Mr. Beauclerk, who, in my opinion, and in his own, was ha&s;tening to Naples for the recovery of his health; but he has &s;topped at Paris, and I know not when he will proceed. Langton is with him.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with &s;peculations about peace and war. The good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of battles and emba&s;&s;ies extends it&s;elf to a very &s;mall part of dome&s;tick life: we all have good and evil, which we feel more &s;en&s;ibly than our petty part of publick mi&s;carriage or pro&s;perity. I am &s;orry for your di&s;appointment, with which you &s;eem more touched than I &s;hould expect a man of your re&s;olution and experience to have been, did I not know that general truths are &s;eldom applied to particular occa&s;ions&punc; and that the fallacy of our &s;elf-love extends it&s;elf as our intere&s;t or affections. Every man believes that mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are unfaithful, and patrons capricious; but he excepts his own mi&s;tre&s;s and his own patron. We have all learned that greatne&s;s is negligent and contemptuous, and that in Courts life is often langui&s;hed away in ungrati|fied expectation; but he that approaches greatne&s;s, or glitters in a Court, imagines that de&s;tiny has at la&s;t exempted him from the common lot.</P>
<P>Do not let &s;uch evils overwhelm you as thou&s;ands have &s;uffered, and thou&s;ands have &s;urmounted; but turn your thoughts with vigour to &s;ome other plan of life, and keep always in your mind, that, with due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Providence, a man of genius has been &s;eldom ruined but by him&s;elf. Your patron's weakne&s;s or in&s;en&s;ibility will finally do you little hurt, if he is not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by your own pa&s;&s;ions. Of your love I know not the propriety, nor can e&s;timate the power; but in love, as in every other pa&s;&s;ion, of which hope is the e&s;&s;ence, we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events. There is, indeed, nothing that &s;o much &s;educes rea&s;on from vigilance, as the thought of pa&s;&s;ing life with an amiable woman; and if all would happen that a lover fancies, I know not what other terre&s;trial happine&s;s would de&s;erve pur&s;uit. But love and marriage are different &s;tates. Tho&s;e who are to &s;uffer the evils
<PB N="204" REF="235" MS="y">
 together, and to &s;uffer often for the &s;ake of one another, &s;oon lo&s;e that tender|ne&s;s of look, and that benevolence of mind, which aro&s;e from the participation of unmingled plea&s;ure and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive amu&s;ement. A woman, we are &s;ure, will not be always fair; we are not &s;ure &s;he will always be virtuous: and man cannot retain through life that re&s;pect and a&s;&s;iduity by which he plea&s;es for a day or for a month. I do not, however, pretend to have di&s;covered that life has any thing more to be de&s;ired than a prudent and virtuous marriage; there|fore know not what coun&s;el to give you.</P>
<P>If you can quit your imagination of love and greatne&s;s, and leave your hopes of preferment and bridal raptures to try once more the fortune of literature and indu&s;try, the way through France is now open. We flatter our&s;elves that we &s;hall cultivate, with great diligence, the arts of peace; and every man will be welcome among us who can teach us any thing we do not know. For your part, you will find all your old friends willing to receive you.</P>
<P>Reynolds &s;till continues to increa&s;e in reputation and in riches. Mi&s;s Williams, who very much loves you, goes on in the old way. Mi&s;s Cotterel is &s;till with Mrs. Porter. Mi&s;s Charlotte is married to Dean Lewis, and has three children. Mr. Levet has married a &s;treet-walker. But the gazette of my narration mu&s;t now arrive to tell you, that Bathur&s;t went phy&s;ician to the army, and died at the Havannah.</P>
<P>I know not whether I have not &s;ent you word that Huggins and Richard&s;on are both dead. When we &s;ee our enemies and friends gliding away before us, let us not forget that we are &s;ubject to the general law of mortality, and &s;hall &s;oon be where our doom will be fixed for ever.</P>

<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of George the Third to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms, opened a new and brighter pro&s;pect to men of literary merit, who had been honoured with no mark of royal favour in the preceding reign. His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's education in this country, as well as his ta&s;te and beneficence, prompted him to be the patron of &s;cience and the arts; and early this year John&s;on having been repre&s;ented to him as a very learned and good man, without any certain provi&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to grant him a pen&s;ion
<PB N="205" REF="236" MS="y">
of three hundred pounds a year. The Earl of Bute was then prime mini&s;ter, and had the honour to announce this in&s;tance of his &s;overeign's bounty, con|cerning which many and various &s;tories, all equally erroneous, have been propagated, maliciou&s;ly repre&s;enting it as a political bribe to John&s;on to de&s;ert his avowed principles, and become the tool of a government which he held to be founded in u&s;urpation. I have taken care to have it in my power to refute them from the mo&s;t authentick information. Lord Bute has told me, that Mr. Wedderburn, now Lord Loughborough, was the per&s;on who fir&s;t men|tioned this &s;ubject to him. Lord Loughborough has told me, that the pen&s;ion was granted to John&s;on &s;olely as the reward of his literary merit, without any &s;tipulation whatever, or even tacit under&s;tanding that he &s;hould write for admini&s;tration. His Lord&s;hip added, that he was confident the political tracts which John&s;on afterwards did write, as they were entirely con&s;onant with his own opinions, would have been written by him, though no pen&s;ion had been granted to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Sheridan and Mr. Murphy, who then lived a good deal both with him and Mr. Wedderburn, have told me, that they previou&s;ly talked with John&s;on upon this matter, and that it was perfectly under&s;tood by all parties that the pen&s;ion was merely honorary. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has told me, that John&s;on called on him after his Maje&s;ty's intention had been notified to him, and &s;aid he wi&s;hed to con&s;ult his friends as to the propriety of his accepting this mark of the royal favour, after the definitions which he had given in his Dictionary of <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ioners.</HI> He &s;aid he would not have Sir Jo&s;hua's an&s;wer till next day, when he would call again, and de&s;ired he might think of it. Sir Jo&s;hua an&s;wered, that he was clear to give his opinion then, that there could be no objection to his receiving from the King a reward for literary merit; and that certainly the definitions in his Dictionary were not applicable to him. John&s;on, it &s;hould &s;eem, was &s;atisfied, for he did not call again till he had accepted the pen&s;ion, and had waited on Lord Bute to thank him. He then told Sir Jo&s;hua that Lord Bute &s;aid to him expre&s;sly, <Q REND="inline">"It is not given you for any thing you are to do, but for what you have done."</Q> His Lord&s;hip, he &s;aid, behaved in the hand&s;ome&s;t manner. He repeated the words twice, that he might be &s;ure that John&s;on heard them, and thus &s;et his mind perfectly at ea&s;e. This nobleman, who has been &s;o virulently abu&s;ed, acted with great honour in this in&s;tance, and di&s;played a mind truly liberal. A mini&s;ter of a more narrow and &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition would have availed him|&s;elf of &s;uch an opportunity to fix an implied obligation on a man of John&s;on's powerful talents to give him his &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="237" MS="y">
 Mr. Murphy and the late Mr. Sheridan &s;everally contended for the di&s;tinction of having been the fir&s;t who mentioned to Mr. Wedderburn that John&s;on ought to have a pen&s;ion. When I &s;poke of this to Lord Loughborough, wi&s;hing to know if he recollected the prime mover in the bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"All his friends a&s;&s;i&s;ted:"</Q> and when I told him that Mr. Sheridan &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted his claim to it, his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He rang the bell."</Q> And it is but ju&s;t to add, that Mr. Sheridan told me, that when he communicated to Dr. John&s;on that a pen&s;ion was to be granted him, he replied, in a fervour of gratitude, <Q REND="inline">"The Engli&s;h language does not afford me terms adequate to my feelings on this occa&s;ion. I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the French. I am <HI>penetr&eacute;</HI> with his Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s."</Q> When I repeated this to Dr. John&s;on, he did not con|tradict it.</P>
<P>His definitions of <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ioner,</HI> partly founded on the &s;atirical ver&s;es of Pope, which he quotes, may be generally true; and yet every body mu&s;t allow, that there may be, and have been, in&s;tances of pen&s;ions given and received upon liberal and honourable terms. Thus, then, it is clear, that there was nothing incon&s;i&s;tent or humiliating in John&s;on's accepting of a pen|&s;ion &s;o unconditionally and &s;o honourably offered to him.</P>
<P>This year his friend Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds paid a vi&s;it of &s;ome weeks to his native county, Devon&s;hire, in which he was accompanied by John&s;on, who was much plea&s;ed with this jaunt, and declared he had derived from it a great acce&s;&s;ion of new ideas. He was entertained at the &s;eats of &s;everal noblemen and gentlemen in the we&s;t of England; but the greate&s;t part of the time was pa&s;&s;ed at Plymouth, where the magnificence of the navy, the &s;hip-building and all its circum&s;tances, afforded him a grand &s;ubject of contemplation. The Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Dock-yard paid him the compliment of ordering the yacht to convey him and his friend to the Eddy&s;tone, to which they accord|ingly &s;ailed. But the weather was &s;o tempe&s;tuous that they could not land.</P>
<P>Reynolds and he were at this time the gue&s;ts of Dr. Mudge, the celebrated &s;urgeon, and now phy&s;ician of that place, not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for quick|ne&s;s of parts and variety of knowledge, than loved and e&s;teemed for his amiable manners; and here John&s;on formed an acquaintanee with Dr. Mudge's father, that very eminent divine, the Reverend Zachary Mudge, Prebendary of Exeter, who was idoli&s;ed in the we&s;t, both for his excellence as a preacher and the uniform perfect propriety of his private conduct. He preached a &s;ermon purpo&s;ely that John&s;on might hear him; and we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards that John&s;on honoured his memory by drawing his character. While John&s;on was at Plymouth, he &s;aw a great many of its inhabitants, and was not &s;paring
<PB N="207" REF="238" MS="y">
of his very entertaining conver&s;ation. It was here that he made that frank and truly original confe&s;&s;ion, that <Q REND="inline">"ignorance, pure ignorance,"</Q> was the cau&s;e of a wrong definition in his Dictionary of the word <HI>pa&s;tern</HI> <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See p. 163.</NOTE>, to the no &s;mall &s;ur|prize of the Lady who put the que&s;tion to him; who having the mo&s;t profound reverence for his character, &s;o as almo&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e him endowed with infalli|bility, expected to hear an explanation (of what, to be &s;ure, &s;eemed &s;trange to a common reader,) drawn from &s;ome deep-learned &s;ource with which &s;he was unacquainted.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, to whom I am obliged for my information concerning this excur&s;ion, mentions a very characteri&s;tical anecdote of John&s;on while at Plymouth. Having ob&s;erved that in con&s;equence of the Dock-yard a new town had ari&s;en about two miles off as a rival to the old; and knowing from his &s;agacity, and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of human nature, that it is certain if a man hates at all, he will hate his next neighbour; he concluded that this new and ri&s;ing town could not but excite the envy and jealou&s;y of the old, in which conjecture he was very &s;oon confirmed; he therefore &s;et him&s;elf re&s;olutely on the &s;ide of the old town, the e&s;tabli&s;hed town, in which his lot was ca&s;t, con&s;idering it as a kind of duty to <HI>&s;tand by</HI> it. He accordingly entered warmly into its intere&s;ts, and upon every occa&s;ion talked of the <HI>dockers,</HI> as the inhabitants of the new town were called, as up&s;tarts and aliens. Plymouth is very plentifully &s;upplied with water by a river brought into it from a great di&s;tance, which is &s;o abundant that it runs to wa&s;te in the town. The Dock, or New-town, being totally de&s;titute of water, petitioned Plymouth that a &s;mall portion of the conduit might be permitted to go to them, and this was now under con&s;ideration. John&s;on, affecting to entertain the pa&s;&s;ions of the place, was violent in oppo&s;ition; and half-laughing at him&s;elf for his pretended zeal, where he had no concern, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, no! I am again&s;t the <HI>dockers;</HI> I am a Plymouth-man. Rogues! let them die of thir&s;t. They &s;hall not have a drop!"</Q></P>

<P>In 1763 he furni&s;hed to <Q REND="inline">"The Poetical Calendar,"</Q> publi&s;hed by Fawkes and Woty, a character of Collins, * which he afterwards ingrafted into his entire life of that admirable poet, in the collection of lives which he wrote for the body of Engli&s;h poetry, formed and publi&s;hed by the book&s;ellers of London. His account of the melancholy depre&s;&s;ion with which Collins was &s;everely afflicted, and which brought him to his grave, is, I think, one of the mo&s;t tender and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages in the whole &s;eries of his writings.

<P>This is to me a memorable year, for in it I had the happine&s;s to obtain the acquaintance of that extraordinary man who&s;e memoirs I am now writing; an acquaintance which I &s;hall ever e&s;teem as one of the mo&s;t fortunate circum|&s;tances in my life. Though then but two-and-twenty, I had for &s;everal years read his works with delight and in&s;truction, and had the highe&s;t reverence for their authour, which had grown up in my fancy into a kind of my&s;terious veneration, by figuring to my&s;elf a &s;tate of &s;ol&edot;mn elevated ab&s;traction, in which I &s;uppo&s;ed him to live in the immen&s;e metropolis of London. Mr. Gentleman, a native of Ireland, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in Scotland as a player, and as an in&s;tructor in the Engli&s;h language, a man who&s;e talents and worth were depre&s;&s;ed by misfortunes, had given me a repre&s;entation of his figure and manner; and during my fir&s;t vi&s;it to London, which was for three months in 1760, Mr. Derrick the poet, who was Gentleman's friend and countryman, flattered me with hopes that he would introduce me to John&s;on, an honour of which I was very ambitious. But he never found an opportunity, which made me doubt that he had promi&s;ed to do what was not in his power, till John&s;on &s;ome years afterwards told me, <Q REND="inline">"Derrick, Sir, might very well have intro|duced you. I had a kindne&s;s for Derrick, and am &s;orry he is dead."</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1761 Mr. Thomas Sheridan was at Edinburgh, and delivered lectures upon the Engli&s;h Language and Publick Speaking to large and re&s;pectable audiences. I was often in his company, and heard him frequently expatiate upon John&s;on's extraordinary knowledge, talents, and virtues, repeat his pointed &s;ayings, de&s;cribe his particularities, and boa&s;t of his being his gue&s;t &s;ometimes till two or three in the morning. At his hou&s;e I hoped to have many opportunities of &s;eeing the &s;age, as Mr. Sheridan obligingly a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould not be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>When I returned to London in the end of 1762, to my &s;urprize and regret I found an irreconcileable difference had taken place between John&s;on and Sheridan. A pen&s;ion of two hundred pounds a year had been given to Sheridan&punc; John&s;on, who as has been already mentioned, thought &s;lightingly of Sheridan's art, upon hearing that he was al&s;o pen&s;ioned, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What! have they given <HI>him</HI> a pen&s;ion? Then it is time for me to give up mine."</Q> Whether this proceeded from a momentary indignation, as if it were an affront to his exalted merit that a player &s;hould be rewarded in the &s;ame manner with him, or was the &s;udden effect of fit of peevi&s;hne&s;s, it was unluckily &s;aid, and, indeed, cannot be ju&s;tified. Mr. Sheridan's pen&s;ion was
<PB N="209" REF="240" MS="y">
granted to him not as a player, but as a &s;ufferer in the cau&s;e of government,  when he was manager of the Theatre Royal in Ireland, when parties ran high in 1753. And it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed that he was a man of literature, and had con&s;iderably improved the arts of reading and &s;peaking with di&s;tinctne&s;s and propriety.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, John&s;on &s;hould have recollected that Mr. Sheridan taught pronun|ciation to Mr. Alexander Wedderburn, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter was married to Sir Harry Er&s;kine, an intimate friend of Lord Bute, who was the favourite of the King; and &s;urely the mo&s;t outrageous Whig will not maintain, that, whatever ought to be the principle in the di&s;po&s;al of <HI>offices,</HI> a <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> ought never to be granted from any bias of court connection. Mr. Macklin, indeed, &s;hared with Mr. Sheridan the honour of in&s;tructing Mr. Wedderburn; and though it was too late in life for a Caledonian to acquire the genuine Engli&s;h cadence, yet &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful were Mr. Wedderburn's in&s;tructors, and his own unabating endea|vours, that he got rid of the coar&s;e part of his Scotch accent, retaining only as much of the <Q REND="inline">"native wood-note wild,"</Q> as to mark his country; which, if any Scotchman &s;hould affect to forget, I &s;hould heartily de&s;pi&s;e him. Notwith|&s;tanding the difficulties which are to be encountered by tho&s;e who have not had the advantange of an Engli&s;h education, he by degrees formed a mode of &s;peaking, to which Engli&s;hmen do not deny the prai&s;e of elegance. Hence his di&s;tingui&s;hed oratory, which he exerted in his own country as an advocate in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, and a ruling elder of the <HI>Kirk,</HI> has had its fame and ample reward, in much higher &s;pheres. When I look back on this noble per&s;on at Edinburgh, in &s;ituations &s;o unworthy of his brilliant powers, and behold LORD LOUGHBOROUGH at London, the change &s;eems almo&s;t like one of the metamorpho&s;es in Ovid; and as his two preceptors, by refining his utterance, gave currency to his talents, we may &s;ay in the words of that poet, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Nam vos muta&s;tis."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this remarkable in&s;tance of &s;ucce&s;sful parts and a&s;&s;iduity, becau&s;e it affords animating encouragement to other gentlemen of North-Britain to try their fortunes in the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, where they may hope to gratify their utmo&s;t ambition; and now that we are one people by the Union, it would &s;urely be illiberal to maintain that they have not an equal title with the natives of any other part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions.</P>
<P>John&s;on complained that a man who di&s;liked him repeated his &s;arca&s;m to Mr. Sheridan, without telling him what followed, which was, that after a pau&s;e he added, <Q REND="inline">"However, I am glad that Mr. Sheridan has a pen&s;ion, for he is a very good man."</Q> Sheridan could never forgive this ha&s;ty contemptuous
<PB N="210" REF="241" MS="y">
 expre&s;&s;ion. It rankled in his mind; and though I informed him of all that John&s;on &s;aid, and that he would be very glad to meet him amicably, he po&s;itively declined repeated offers which I made, and once went off abruptly from a hou&s;e where he and I were engaged to dine, becau&s;e he was told that Dr. John&s;on was to be there. I have no &s;ympathetick feeling with &s;uch per&s;evering re&s;entment. It is painful when there is a breach between tho&s;e who have lived together &s;ocially and cordially; and I wonder that there is not, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, a mutual wi&s;h that it &s;hould be healed. I could perceive that Mr. Sheridan was by no means &s;atisfied with John&s;on's acknow|ledging him to be a good man. That could not &s;ooth his injured vanity. I could not but &s;mile, at the &s;ame time that I was offended, to ob&s;erve Sheridan in the Life of Swift <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">P. 447.</NOTE>, which he afterwards publi&s;hed, attempting, in the writhings of his re&s;entment, to depreciate John&s;on, by characteri&s;ing him <Q REND="inline">"A writer of gigantick fame in the&s;e days of little men;"</Q> that very John&s;on whom he once &s;o highly admired and venerated.</P>
<P>This rupture with Sheridan deprived John&s;on of one of his mo&s;t agreeable re&s;ources for amu&s;ement in his lonely evenings; for Sheridan's well-informed, animated, and bu&s;tling mind never &s;uffered conver&s;ation to &s;tagnate; and Mrs. Sheridan was a mo&s;t agreeable companion to an intellectual man. She was &s;en&s;ible, ingenious, una&s;&s;uming, yet communicative. I recollect, with &s;atisfaction, many plea&s;ing hours which I pa&s;&s;ed with her under the ho&s;pitable roof of her hu&s;band, who was to me a very kind friend. Her novel, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of Mi&s;s Sydney Biddulph,"</Q> contains an excellent moral, while it inculcates a future &s;tate of retribution; and what it teaches is impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind by a &s;eries of as deep di&s;tre&s;s as can affect humanity. John&s;on paid her this high compliment upon it: <Q REND="inline">"I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers &s;uffer &s;o much."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Davies the actor, who then kept a book&s;eller's &s;hop in Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet, Covent-garden, told me that John&s;on was very much his friend, and came frequently to his hou&s;e, where he more than once invited me to meet him; but by &s;ome unlucky accident or other he was prevented from coming to us.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Davies was a man of good under&s;tanding and talents, with the advantage of a liberal education. Though &s;omewhat pompous, he was an entertaining companion; and his literary performances have no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of merit. He was a friendly and very ho&s;pitable man. Both he and his wife, (who has been celebrated for her beauty,) though upon the &s;tage
<PB N="211" REF="242" MS="y">
for many years, maintained an uniform decency of character; and John&s;on e&s;teemed them, and lived in as ea&s;y an intimacy with them as with any family which he u&s;ed to vi&s;it. Mr. Davies recollected &s;everal of John&s;on's remark|able &s;ayings, and was one of the be&s;t of the many imitators of his voice and manner, while relating them. He increa&s;ed my impatience more and more to &s;ee the extraordinary man who&s;e works I highly valued, and who&s;e conver|&s;ation was reported to be &s;o peculiarly excellent.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on Monday the 16th of May, when I was &s;itting in Mr. Davies's back parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, John&s;on unexpectedly came into the &s;hop; and Mr. Davies having perceived him through the gla&s;s door of the room in which we were &s;itting, advancing towards us,&mdash;he announced his aweful approach to me, &s;omewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addre&s;&s;es Hamlet on the appearance of his father's gho&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"Look, my Lord, it comes."</Q> I found that I had a very perfect idea of John&s;on's figure, from the portrait of him painted by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds &s;oon after he had publi&s;hed his Dictionary, in the attitude of &s;itting in his ea&s;y chair in deep meditation, which was the fir&s;t picture his friend did for him, which Sir Jo&s;hua has very kindly pre&s;ented to me, and from which an engraving has been made for this work. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and re&s;pectfully introduced me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice again&s;t the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I &s;aid to Davies, <Q REND="inline">"Don't tell where I come from."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"From Scotland,"</Q> cried Davies, rogui&s;hly. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. John&s;on (&s;aid I) I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it."</Q> I am willing to flatter my&s;elf that I meant this as light plea&s;antry to &s;ooth and conciliate him, and not as any humiliating aba&s;ement at the expence of my country. But however that might be, this &s;peech was &s;omewhat unlucky; for with that quickne&s;s of wit for which he was &s;o remark|able, he &s;eized the expre&s;&s;ion <Q REND="inline">"come from Scotland,"</Q> which I u&s;ed in the &s;en&s;e of being of that country; and as if I had &s;aid that I had come away from it or left it, retorted, <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help."</Q> This &s;troke &s;tunned me a good deal; and when we had &s;at down, I felt my&s;elf not a little embarra&s;&s;ed, and apprehen&s;ive of what might come next. He then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Davies: <Q REND="inline">"What do you think of Garrick? He has refu&s;ed me an order for the play for Mi&s;s Williams, becau&s;e he knows the hou&s;e will be full, and that an order would be worth three &s;hillings."</Q> Eager to take any opening to get into conver&s;ation with him, I ventured to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"O, Sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge &s;uch a trifle to you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he, with a &s;tern look,) I have known
<PB N="212" REF="243" MS="y">
 David Garrick longer than you have done; and I know no right you have to talk to me on the &s;ubject."</Q> Perhaps I de&s;erved this check; for it was rather pre&s;umptuous in me, an entire &s;tranger, to expre&s;s any doubt of the ju&s;tice of his animadver&s;ion upon his old acquaintance and pupil <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">That this was a momentary &s;ally again&s;t Garrick there can be no doubt; for at John&s;on's de&s;ire he had, &s;ome years before, given a benefit-night at his theatre to this very per&s;on, by which &s;he got two hundred pounds. John&s;on, indeed, upon all other occa&s;ions, when I was in his company, prai&s;ed the very liberal charity of Garrick. I once mentioned to him, <Q REND="inline">"It is ob&s;erved, Sir, that you attack Garrick your&s;elf, but will &s;uffer nobody el&s;e to do it."</Q> JOHNSON, (&s;miling) <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is true."</Q></NOTE>. I now felt my|&s;elf much mortified, and began to think that the hope which I had long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was bla&s;ted. And, in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly &s;trong, and my re&s;olution uncommonly per&s;e|vering, &s;o rough a reception might have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts. Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field not wholly di&s;comfited; and was &s;oon rewarded by hearing &s;ome of his conver|&s;ation, of which I pre&s;erved the following &s;hort minute, without marking the que&s;tions and ob&s;ervations by which it was produced.</P>

<P>In barbarous &s;ociety, &s;uperiority of parts is of real con&s;equence. Great &s;trength or great wi&s;dom is of much value to an individual. But in more poli&s;hed times there are people to do every thing for money; and then there are a number of other &s;uperiorities, &s;uch as tho&s;e of birth and fortune, and rank, that di&s;&s;ipate men's attention, and leave no extraordinary &s;hare of re&s;pect for per&s;onal and intellectual &s;uperiority. This is wi&s;ely ordered by Providence, to pre&s;erve &s;ome equality among mankind.</P>
<P>Sir, this book ('The Elements of Critici&s;m,' which he had taken up,) is a pretty e&s;&s;ay, and de&s;erves to be held in &s;ome e&s;timation, though much of it is chimerical.</P></Q>
<P>Speaking of one who with more than ordinary boldne&s;s attacked publick mea&s;ures and the royal family, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think he is &s;afe from the law, but he is an abu&s;ive &s;coundrel; and in&s;tead of applying to my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice to puni&s;h him, I would &s;end half a dozen footmen and have him well ducked."</Q></P>

Sheridan will not &s;ucceed at Bath with his oratory. Ridicule has gone  down before him, and, I doubt, Derrick is his enemy <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mr. Sheridan was then reading lectures upon Oratory at Bath, where Derrick was Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, or, as the phra&s;e is, KING.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Derrick may do very well, as long as he can outrun his character; but the moment his character gets up with him it is all over.</P></Q>
<P>It is, however, but ju&s;t to record, that &s;ome years afterwards, when I reminded him of this &s;arca&s;m, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, but Derrick has now got a character that he need not run away from."</Q></P>
<P>I was highly plea&s;ed with the extraordinary vigour of his conver&s;ation, and regretted that I was drawn away from it by an engagement at another place. I had, for a part of the evening, been left alone with him, and had ven|tured to make an ob&s;ervation now and then, which he received very civilly; &s;o that I was &s;atisfied that though there was a roughne&s;s in his manner, there was no ill-nature in his di&s;po&s;ition. Davies followed me to the door, and when I complained to him a little of the hard blows which the great man had given me, he kindly took upon him to con&s;ole me by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Don't be unea&s;y. I can &s;ee he likes you very well."</Q></P>
<P>A few days afterwards I called on Davies, and a&s;ked him if he thought I might take the liberty of waiting on Mr. John&s;on at his Chambers in the Temple. He &s;aid I certainly might, and that Mr. John&s;on would take it as a compliment. So upon Tue&s;day the 24th, after having been enlivened by the witty &s;allies of Me&s;&s;ieurs Thornton, Wilkes, Churchill and Lloyd, with whom I had pa&s;&s;ed the morning, I boldly repaired to John&s;on. His Cham|bers were on the fir&s;t floor of No. 1, Inner Temple-lane, and I entered them with an impre&s;&s;ion given me by the Reverend Dr. Blair, of Edinburgh, who had been introduced to him not long before, and de&s;cribed his having <Q REND="inline">"found the giant in his den;"</Q> an expre&s;&s;ion, which, when I came to be pretty well acquainted with John&s;on, I repeated to him, and he was diverted at this picture&s;que account of him&s;elf. Dr. Blair had been pre&s;ented to him by Dr. James Fordyce. At this time the controver&s;y concerning the pieces publi&s;hed by Mr. James Macpher&s;on, as tran&s;lations of O&s;&s;ian, was at its height. John&s;on had all along denied their authenticity; and, what was &s;till more provoking to their admirers, maintained that they had no merit. The &s;ubject having been introduced by Dr. Fordyce, Dr. Blair, relying on the internal evidence of their antiquity, a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on whether he thought any man of a modern age could have written &s;uch poems? John&s;on replied, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, many
<PB N="214" REF="245" MS="y">
 men, many women, and many children."</Q> John&s;on, at this time, did not know that Dr. Blair had ju&s;t publi&s;hed a Di&s;&s;ertation, not only defending their authenticity, but &s;eriou&s;ly ranking them with the poems of Homer and Virgil; and when he was afterwards informed of this circum&s;tance, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure at Dr. Fordyce's having &s;ugge&s;ted the topick, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;orry that they got thus much for their pains. Sir, it was like leading one to talk of a book, when the authour is concealed behind the door."</Q></P>
<P>He received me very courteou&s;ly; but, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that his apart|ment, and furniture, and morning dre&s;s, were &s;ufficiently uncouth. His brown &s;uit of cloaths looked very ru&s;ty; he had on a little old &s;hrivelled unpowdered wig, which was too &s;mall for his head; his &s;hirt-neck and knees of his breeches were loo&s;e; his black wor&s;ted &s;tockings ill drawn up; and he had a pair of unbuckled &s;hoes by way of &s;lippers. But all the&s;e &s;lovenly particu|larities were forgotten the moment that he began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do not recollect, were &s;itting with him; and when they went away, I al&s;o ro&s;e; but he &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, don't go."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid I) I am afraid that I intrude upon you. It is benevolent to allow me to &s;it and hear you."</Q> He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with this compliment, which I &s;incerely paid him, and an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am obliged to any man who vi&s;its me."</Q> I have pre&s;erved the following &s;hort minute of what pa&s;&s;ed this day.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Madne&s;s frequently di&s;covers it&s;elf merely by unnece&s;&s;ary deviation from the u&s;ual modes of the world. My poor friend Smart &s;hewed the di&s;turbance of his mind by falling upon his knees and &s;aying his prayers in the &s;treet, or in any other unu&s;ual place. Now although, rationally &s;peaking, it is greater madne&s;s not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are &s;o many who do not pray, that their under&s;tanding is not called in que&s;tion."</Q></P>
<P>Concerning this unfortunate poet, Chri&s;topher Smart, who was confined in a mad-hou&s;e, he had, at another time, the following conver&s;ation with Dr. Burney. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems as if his mind had cea&s;ed to &s;truggle with the di&s;ea&s;e; for he grows fat upon it."</Q> BURNEY. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exerci&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; he has partly as much exerci&s;e as he u&s;ed to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he u&s;ed for exerci&s;e to walk to the alehou&s;e; but he was <HI>carried</HI> back again. I did not think he ought to be &s;hut up. His infirmities were not noxious to &s;ociety. He in&s;i&s;ted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit. Smart as any one el&s;e. Another charge was, that he did not love clean linen; and I have no pa&s;&s;ion for it."</Q></P>

<Q><P>The morality of an action depends on the motive from which we act.

So, religious exerci&s;es, if not performed with an intention to plea&s;e GOD, avail us nothing.

<P>Talking of Garrick, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He is the fir&s;t man in the world for &s;prightly conver&s;ation."</Q></P>
<P>When I ro&s;e a &s;econd time he again pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;tay, which I did.</P>
<P>He told me, that he generally went abroad at four in the afternoon, and &s;eldom came home till two in the morning. I took the liberty to a&s;k if he did not think it wrong to live thus, and not make more u&s;e of his great talents. He owned it was a bad habit. On reviewing, at the di&s;tance of many years, my journal of this period, I wonder how, at my fir&s;t vi&s;it, I ventured to talk to him &s;o freely, and that he bore it with &s;o much indulgence.</P>
<P>Before we parted he was &s;o good as to promi&s;e to favour me with his com|pany one evening at my lodgings; and, as I took my leave, &s;hook me cordially by the hand. It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that I felt no little elation at having now &s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed an acquaintance of which I had been &s;o long ambitious.</P>
<P>My readers will, I tru&s;t, excu&s;e me for being thus minutely circum&s;tantial, when it is con&s;idered that the acquaintance of Dr. John&s;on was to me a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition, and laid the foundation of whatever in&s;truction and enter|tainment they may receive from my collections concerning the great &s;ubject of the work which they are now peru&s;ing.</P>
<P>I did not vi&s;it him again till Monday, June 13, at which time I recollect no part of his conver&s;ation, except that when I told him I had been to &s;ee John&s;on ride upon three hor&s;es, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Such a man, Sir, &s;hould be encouraged; for his performances &s;hew the extent of the human powers in

 one in&s;tance, and thus tend to rai&s;e our opinion of the faculties of man. He &s;hews what may be attained by per&s;evering application; &s;o that every man may hope, that by giving as much application, although perhaps he may never ride three hor&s;es at a time or dance upon a wire, yet he may be equally expert in whatever profe&s;&s;ion he has cho&s;en to pur&s;ue."</Q></P>
<P>He again &s;hook me by the hand at parting, and a&s;ked me why I did not come oftener to him. Tru&s;ting that I was now in his good graces, I an&s;wered, that he had not given me much encouragement, and reminded him of the check I had received from him at our fir&s;t interview. <Q REND="inline">"Poh, poh! (&s;aid he, with a complacent &s;mile,) never mind the&s;e things. Come to me as often as you can. I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you."</Q></P>
<P>I had learnt that his place of frequent re&s;ort was the Mitre tavern in Fleet|&s;treet, where he loved to &s;it up late, and I begged I might be allowed to pa&s;s an evening with him there &s;oon, which he promi&s;ed I &s;hould. A few days afterwards I met him near Temple-bar, about one o'clock in the morning, and a&s;ked if he would then go to the Mitre. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) it is too late; they won't let us in. But I'll go with you another night with all my heart."</Q></P>
<P>A revolution of &s;ome importance in my plan of life had ju&s;t taken place; for in&s;tead of procuring a commi&s;&s;ion in the foot-guards, which was my own inclination, I had, in compliance with my father's wi&s;hes, agreed to &s;tudy the law, and was &s;oon to &s;et out for Utrecht, to hear the lectures of an excellent Civilian in that Univer&s;ity, and then to proceed on my travels. Though very de&s;irous of obtaining Dr. John&s;on's advice and in&s;tructions on the mode of pur&s;uing my &s;tudies, I was at this time &s;o occupied, &s;hall I call it? or &s;o di&s;&s;ipated, by the amu&s;ements of London, that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25, when happening to dine at Clifton's eating-hou&s;e, in Butcher-row, I was &s;urprized to perceive John&s;on come in and take his &s;eat at another table. The mode of dining, or rather being fed at &s;uch hou&s;es in London, is well known to many to be particularly un&s;ocial, as there is no Ordinary, or united company, but each per&s;on has his own me&s;s, and is under no obligation to hold any intercour&s;e with any one. A liberal and full-minded man, however, who loves to talk, will break through this churli&s;h and un&s;ocial re&s;traint. John&s;on and an Iri&s;h gentleman got into a di&s;pute concerning the cau&s;e of &s;ome part of mankind being black. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) it has been accounted for in three ways: either by &s;uppo|&s;ing that they are the po&s;terity of Ham, who was cur&s;ed; or that GOD at fir&s;t created two kinds of men, one black and another white; or that by the heat of the &s;un the &s;kin is &s;corched, and &s;o acquires a &s;ooty hue. This matter has
<PB N="217" REF="248" MS="y">
been much canva&s;&s;ed among naturali&s;ts, but has never been brought to any certain i&s;&s;ue."</Q> What the Iri&s;hman &s;aid is totally obliterated from my mind; but I remember that he became very warm and intemperate in his expre&s;|&s;ions; upon which John&s;on ro&s;e, and quietly walked away. When he had retired, his antagoni&s;t took his revenge, as he thought, by &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"He has a mo&s;t ungainly figure, and an affectation of pompo&s;ity unworthy of a man of genius."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on had not ob&s;erved that I was in the room. I followed him, how|ever, and he agreed to meet me in the evening at the Mitre. I called on him, and we went thither at nine. We had a good &s;upper, and port wine, of which he then &s;ometimes drank a bottle. The orthodox high-church &s;ound of the Mitre, the figure and manner of the celebrated Samuel John&s;on, the extra|ordinary power and preci&s;ion of his conver&s;ation, and the pride ari&s;ing from finding my&s;elf admitted as his companion, produced a variety of &s;en&s;ations, and a plea&s;ing elevation of mind beyond what I had ever before experienced. I find in my journal the following minute of our conver&s;ation, which, though it will give but a very faint notion of what pa&s;&s;ed, is, in &s;ome degree, a valuable record; and it will be curious in this view, as &s;hewing how habitual to his mind were &s;ome opinions which appear in his works.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Colley Cibber, Sir, was by no means a blockhead; but by arrogating to him&s;elf too much, he was in danger of lo&s;ing that degree of e&s;timation to which he was entitled. His friends gave out that he <HI>intended</HI> his birth-day Odes &s;hould be bad: but that was not the ca&s;e, Sir; for he kept them many months by him, and a few years before he died he &s;hewed me one of them, with great &s;olicitude to render it as perfect as might be, and I made &s;ome corrections, to which he was not very willing to &s;ubmit. I remember the following couplet in allu&s;ion to the King and him&s;elf:
<Q><L>'Perch'd on the eagle's &s;oaring wing</L>
<L>'The lowly linnet loves to &s;ing.'</L></Q>
Sir, he had heard &s;omething of the fabulous tale of the wren &s;itting upon the eagle's wing, and he had applied it to a linnet. Cibber's familiar &s;tyle, however, was better than that which Whitehead has a&s;&s;umed. <HI>Grand</HI> non&s;en&s;e is in&s;upportable. Whitehead is but a little man to in&s;cribe ver&s;es to players."</Q></P>
<P>I did not pre&s;ume to controvert this cen&s;ure, which was tinctured with his prejudice again&s;t players; but I could not help thinking that a dramatick poet might with propriety pay a compliment to an eminent performer, as Whitehead has very happily done in his ver&s;es to Mr. Garrick.</P>

 <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not think Gray a fir&s;t-rate poet. He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. The ob&s;curity in which he has involved him|&s;elf will not per&s;uade us that he is &s;ublime. His Elegy in a church-yard has a happy &s;election of images, but I don't like what are called his great things. His Ode which begins
<Q><L>'Ruin &s;eize thee, ruthle&s;s King,</L>
<L>'Confu&s;ion on thy banners wait,'</L></Q>
has been celebrated for its abruptne&s;s, and plunging into the &s;ubject all at once. But &s;uch arts as the&s;e have no merit, unle&s;s when they are original. We admire them only once; and this abruptne&s;s has nothing new in it. We have had it often before. Nay, we have it in the old &s;ong of Johnny Arm&s;trong:
<Q><L>'Is there ever a man in all Scotland</L>
<L>'From the highe&s;t e&s;tate to the lowe&s;t degree, &amp;c.'</L></Q>
And then, Sir,
<Q><L>'Yes, there is a man in We&s;tmoreland,</L>
<L>'And Johnny Arm&s;trong they do him call.'</L></Q>
There, now, you plunge at once into the &s;ubject. You have no previous narration to lead you to it.&mdash;The two next lines in that Ode are, I think, very good:
<Q><L>'Though fann'd by conque&s;t's crim&s;on wing,</L>
<L>'They mock the air with idle &s;tate <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">My friend Mr. Malone, in his valuable comments on Shak&s;peare, has traced in that great poet the <HI>disjecta membra</HI> of the&s;e lines.</NOTE>."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Here let it be ob&s;erved, that although his opinion of Gray's poetry was widely different from mine, and I believe from that of mo&s;t men of ta&s;te, by whom it is with ju&s;tice highly admired, there is certainly much ab&s;urdity in the clamour which has been rai&s;ed, as if he had been culpably injurious to the merit of that bard, and had been actuated by envy. Alas! ye little &s;hort-&s;ighted criticks, could John&s;on be envious of the talents of any of his con|temporaries? That his opinion on this &s;ubject was what in private and in publick he uniformly expre&s;&s;ed, regardle&s;s of what others might think, we may wonder, and perhaps regret; but it is &s;hallow and unju&s;t to charge him with expre&s;&s;ing what he did not think.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="250" MS="y">
Finding him in a placid humour, and wi&s;hing to avail my&s;elf of the oppor|tunity which I fortunately had of con&s;ulting a &s;age, to hear who&s;e wi&s;dom, I conceived in the ardour of youthful imagination, that men filled with a noble enthu&s;ia&s;m for intellectual improvement would gladly have re&s;orted from di&s;tant lands; I opened my mind to him ingenuou&s;ly, and gave him a little &s;ketch of my life, to which he was plea&s;ed to li&s;ten with great attention.</P>
<P>I acknowledged, that though educated very &s;trictly in the principles of religion, I had for &s;ome time been mi&s;led into a certain degree of infidelity; but that I was come now to a better way of thinking, and was fully &s;atisfied of the truth of the Chri&s;tian revelation, though I was not clear as to every point con&s;idered to be orthodox. Being at all times a curious examiner of the human mind, and plea&s;ed with an undi&s;gui&s;ed di&s;play of what had pa&s;&s;ed in it, he called to me with warmth, <Q REND="inline">"Give me your hand; I have taken a liking to you."</Q> He then began to de&s;cant upon the force of te&s;timony, and the little we could know of final cau&s;es; &s;o that the objections of, why was it &s;o? or why was it not &s;o? ought not to di&s;turb us: adding, that he him&s;elf had at one period been guilty of a temporary neglect of religion, but that it was not the re&s;ult of argument, but mere ab&s;ence of thought.</P>
<P>After having given credit to reports of his bigotry, I was agreeably &s;ur|prized when he expre&s;&s;ed the following very liberal &s;entiment, which has the additional value of obviating an objection to our holy religion, founded upon the di&s;cordant tenets of Chri&s;tians them&s;elves: <Q REND="inline">"For my part, Sir, I think all Chri&s;tians, whether Papi&s;ts or Prote&s;tants, agree in the e&s;&s;ential articles, and that their differences are trivial, and rather political than religious."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of belief in gho&s;ts. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I make a di&s;tinction between what a man may experience by the mere &s;trength of his imagination, and what imagination cannot po&s;&s;ibly produce. Thus, &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould think that I &s;aw a form, and heard a voice cry 'John&s;on, you are a very wicked fellow, and unle&s;s you repent you will certainly be puni&s;hed;' my own unwor|thine&s;s is &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, that I might <HI>imagine</HI> I thus &s;aw and heard, and therefore I &s;hould not believe that an external communication had been made to me. But if a form &s;hould appear, and a voice &s;hould tell me that a particular man had died at a particular place, and a particular hour, a fact which I had no apprehen&s;ion of, nor any means of knowing, and this fact with all its circum&s;tances &s;hould afterwards be unque&s;tionably proved, I &s;hould, in that ca&s;e be per&s;uaded that I had &s;upernatural intelligence imparted to me."</Q></P>
<P>Here it is proper, once for all, to give a true and fair &s;tatement of John&s;on's way of thinking upon the que&s;tion whether departed &s;pirits are ever permitted
<PB N="220" REF="251" MS="y">
 to appear in this world, or in any way to operate upon human life. He has been ignorantly mi&s;repre&s;ented as weakly credulous upon that &s;ubject; and therefore, though I feel an inclination to di&s;dain and treat with &s;ilent contempt &s;o ab&s;urd a notion concerning my illu&s;trious friend, yet as I find it has gained ground, it is nece&s;&s;ary to refute it. The real fact then is, that John&s;on had a very philo&s;ophical mind, and &s;uch a rational re&s;pect for te&s;timony, as to make him &s;ubmit his under&s;tanding to what was authentically proved, though he could not comprehend why it was &s;o. Being thus di&s;po&s;ed, he was willing to inquire into the truth of any relation of &s;upernatural agency, a general belief of which has prevailed in all nations and ages. But &s;o far was he from being the dupe of implicit faith, that he examined the matter with a jealous attention, and no man was more ready to refute its fal&s;hood when he had di&s;covered it. Churchill, in his poem entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Gho&s;t,"</Q> availed him|&s;elf of the ab&s;urd credulity imputed to John&s;on, and drew a caricature of him under the name of <Q REND="inline">"POMPOSO,"</Q> repre&s;enting him as one of the believers of the &s;tory of a Gho&s;t in Cock-lane, which in the year 1762 had gained very general credit in London. Many of my readers, I am convinced, are to this hour under an impre&s;&s;ion that John&s;on was thus fooli&s;hly deceived. It will therefore &s;urprize them a good deal when they are informed upon undoubted authority, that John&s;on was one of tho&s;e by whom the impo&s;ture was detected. The &s;tory had become &s;o popular, that he thought it &s;hould be inve&s;tigated; and in this re&s;earch he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, the great detecter of impo&s;tures, who informs me, that after the gentlemen who went and examined into the evidence were &s;atisfied of its fal&s;ity, John&s;on wrote in their pre&s;ence an account of it, which was publi&s;hed in the new&s;papers and Gentleman's Magazine, and undeceived the world <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>The account was as follows: <Q REND="inline">"On the night of the 1&s;t of February, many gentlemen, emi|nent for their rank and character, were, by the invitation of the Reverend Mr. Aldrich, of Clerkenwell, a&s;&s;embled at his hou&s;e, for the examination of the noi&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be made by a departed &s;pirit, for the detection of &s;ome enormous crime.</Q></P>
<Q><P>About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;|turbed by a &s;pirit, had, with proper caution, been put to bed by &s;everal ladies. They &s;at rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down &s;tairs, when they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, any knowledge or belief of fraud.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit had before publickly promi&s;ed, by an affirmative knock, that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the valut under the church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where the body is depo&s;ited, and give a token of her pre&s;ence there, by a knock upon her coffin; it was therefore determined to make this trial of the exi&s;tence or veracity of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit.</P>
<P>While they were enquiring and deliberating, they were &s;ummoned into the girl's chamber by &s;ome ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and &s;cratches. When the gentle|men entered, the girl declared that &s;he felt the &s;pirit like a mou&s;e upon her back, and was required to hold her hands out of bed. From that time, though the &s;pirit was very &s;olemnly required to manife&s;t its exi&s;tence by appearance, by impre&s;&s;ion on the hand or body of any pre&s;ent, by &s;cratches, knocks, or any other agency, no evidence of any preter-natural power was exhibited.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit was then very &s;eriou&s;ly adverti&s;ed that the per&s;on to whom the promi&s;e was made of &s;triking the coffin, was then about to vi&s;it the vault, and that the performance of the promi&s;e was then claimed. The company at one o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promi&s;e was made, went with another into the vault. The &s;pirit was &s;olemnly required to perform its promi&s;e, but nothing more than &s;ilence en&s;ued: the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be accu&s;ed by the &s;pirit, then went down with &s;everal others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they examined the girl, but could draw no confe&s;&s;ion from her. Between two and three &s;he de&s;ired and was permitted to go home with her father.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, the opinion of the whole a&s;&s;embly, that the child has &s;ome art of making or counterfeiting a particular noi&s;e, and that there is no agency of any higher cau&s;e.</P></Q></NOTE>.</P>

Our conver&s;ation proceeded. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) I am a friend to &s;ubordi|nation, as mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety. There is a reciprocal plea&s;ure in governing and being governed."</Q></P>

<P>I mentioned Mallet's tragedy of ELVIRA, which had been acted the pre|ceding winter at Drury-lane, and that the Honourable Andrew Er&s;kine, Mr. Demp&s;ter, and my&s;elf, had joined in writing a pamphlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Critical Strictures"</Q> again&s;t it <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The Critical Review, in which Mallet him&s;elf &s;ometimes wrote, characteri&s;ed this pam|phlet as <Q REND="inline">"the crude efforts of envy, petulance, and &s;elf-conceit."</Q> There being thus three epithets, we the three authours had a humourous contention how each &s;hould be appropriated.</NOTE>. That the mildne&s;s of Demp&s;ter's di&s;po&s;ition had, however, relented; and he had candidly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We have hardly a right to abu&s;e this tragedy; for, bad as it is, how vain &s;hould either of us be to write one not near &s;o good."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; this is not ju&s;t rea&s;oning. You <HI>may</HI> abu&s;e a tragedy, though you cannot write one. You may &s;cold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make tables."</Q></P>
<P>When I talked to him of the paternal e&s;tate to which I was heir, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, let me tell you, that to be a Scotch landlord, where you have a number of families dependent upon you, and attached to you, is, perhaps, as high a &s;ituation as humanity can arrive at. A merchant upon the 'Change of London, with a hundred thou&s;and pounds, is nothing: an Engli&s;h duke,
<PB N="222" REF="253" MS="y">
 with an immen&s;e fortune, is nothing: he has no tenants&punc; who con&s;ider them|&s;elves as under his patriarchal care, and who will follow him to the field upon any emergency."</Q></P>
<P>His notion of the dignity of a Scotch landlord had been formed upon what he had heard of the Highland Chiefs; for it is long &s;ince a lowland landlord has been &s;o curtailed in his feudal authority, that he has little more influence over his tenants than an Engli&s;h landlord; and of late years mo&s;t of the Highland Chiefs have de&s;troyed, by means too well known, the princely power which they once enjoyed.</P>
<P>He proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"Your going abroad, Sir, and breaking off idle habits, may be of great importance to you. I would go where there are courts and learned men. There is a good deal of Spain that has not been perambulated. I would have you go thither. A man of inferiour talents to yours may furni&s;h us with u&s;eful ob&s;ervations upon that country."</Q> His &s;uppo&s;ing me, at that period of life, capable of writing an account of my travels that would de&s;erve to be read, elated me not a little.</P>
<P>I appeal to every impartial reader whether this faithful detail of his frank|ne&s;s, complacency, and kindne&s;s to a young man, a &s;tranger and a Scotchman, does not refute the unju&s;t opinion of the har&s;hne&s;s of his general demeanour. His occa&s;ional reproofs of folly, impudence, or impiety, and even the &s;udden &s;allies of his con&s;titutional irritability of temper, which have been pre&s;erved for the poignancy of their wit, have produced that opinion among tho&s;e who have not con&s;idered that &s;uch in&s;tances, though collected by Mrs. Piozzi into a &s;mall volume, and read over in a few hours, were, in fact, &s;cattered through a long &s;eries of years; years, in which his time was chiefly &s;pent in in&s;tructing and delighting mankind by his writings and conver&s;ation, in acts of piety to GOD, and good-will to men.</P>
<P>I complained to him that I had not yet acquired much knowledge, and a&s;ked his advice as to my &s;tudies. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Don't talk of &s;tudy now.

<P>As Dr. Oliver Gold&s;mith will frequently appear in this narrative, I &s;hall endeavour to make my readers in &s;ome degree acquainted with his &s;ingular character. He was a native of Ireland, and a contemporary with Mr. Burke, at Trinity College, Dublin, but did not then give much promi&s;e of future celebrity. He, however, ob&s;erved to Mr. Malone, that <Q REND="inline">"though he made no great figure in mathematicks, which was a &s;tudy in much repute there, he could turn an Ode of Horace better than any of them."</Q> He afterwards &s;tudied phy&s;ick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t Edinburgh, and upon the Continent; and I have been informed, was enabled to pur&s;ue his travels on foot, partly by demanding at Univer&s;ities to enter the li&s;ts as a di&s;putant, by which, according to the cu&s;tom of many of them, he was entitled to the premium of a crown, when luckily for him his challenge was not accepted; &s;o that, as I once ob&s;erved to Dr. John&s;on, he <HI>di&s;puted</HI> his pa&s;&s;age through Europe. He then came to England, and was employed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the capacities of an u&s;her to an academy, a corrector of the pre&s;s, a reviewer, and a writer for a new&s;paper. He had &s;agacity enough to cultivate a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly the acquaintance of John&s;on, and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of &s;uch a model. To me and many others it appeared that he &s;tudiou&s;ly copied the manner of John&s;on, though, indeed, upon a &s;maller &s;cale.</P>
<P>At this time I think he had publi&s;hed nothing with his name, though it was pretty generally known that <HI>one Dr. Gold&s;mith</HI> was the authour of <Q REND="inline">"An E&s;&s;ay on the pre&s;ent State of polite Literature,"</Q> and of <Q REND="inline">"The Citizen of the World,"</Q> a &s;eries of letters &s;uppo&s;ed to be written from London by a Chine&s;e.

Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has mentioned to me that he frequently heard Gold&s;mith talk warmly of the plea&s;ure of being liked, and ob&s;erve how hard it would be if literary excellence &s;hould preclude a man from that &s;atisfaction, which he perceived it often did, from the envy which attended it; and therefore Sir Jo&s;hua was convinced that he was intentionally more ab&s;urd, in order to le&s;&s;en him&s;elf in &s;ocial intercour&s;e, tru&s;ting that his character would be &s;ufficiently &s;upported by his works. If it indeed was his intention to appear ab&s;urd in company, he was often very &s;ucce&s;sful. But with due deference to Sir Jo&s;hua's ingenuity, I think the conjecture too refined.</NOTE>; but, in truth, this has been greatly exaggerated. He had, no doubt, a more than common &s;hare of that hurry of ideas which we often find in his country|men, and which &s;ometimes produces a laughable confu&s;ion in expre&s;&s;ing them. He was very much what the French call <HI>un etourdi,</HI> and from vanity and an eager de&s;ire of being con&s;picuous wherever he was, he frequently talked care|le&s;sly without knowledge of the &s;ubject, or even without thought. His per|&s;on was &s;hort, his countenance coar&s;e and vulgar, his deportment that of a &s;cholar aukwardly affecting the ea&s;y gentleman. Tho&s;e who were in any way di&s;tingui&s;hed, excited envy in him to &s;o ridiculous an exce&s;s, that the in&s;tances of it are hardly credible. When accompanying two beautiful young ladies with their mother on a tour in France, he was &s;eriou&s;ly angry that more atten|tion was paid to them than to him; and once at the exhibition of the <HI>Fantoc|cini,</HI> in London, when tho&s;e who &s;at next him ob&s;erved with what dexterity a puppet was made to to&s;s a pike, he could not bear that it &s;hould have &s;uch prai&s;e, and exclaimed with &s;ome warmth, <Q REND="inline">"P&s;haw! I can do it better my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>He, I am afraid, had no &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem of any &s;ort, &s;o that his conduct mu&s;t not be &s;trictly &s;crutini&s;ed; but his affections were &s;ocial and generous, and when he had money he gave it away very liberally. His de&s;ire of imagi|nary con&s;equence predominated over his attention to truth. When he began to ri&s;e into notice, he &s;aid he had a brother who was Dean of Durham, a fiction &s;o ea&s;ily detected, that it is wonderful how he &s;hould have been &s;o incon&s;iderate as to hazard it. He boa&s;ted to me at this time of the power of his pen in commanding money, which I believe was true in a certain degree, though in the in&s;tance he gave he was by no means correct. He told me that he had &s;old a novel for four hundred pounds. This was his <Q REND="inline">"Vicar of

Wakefield."</Q> But John&s;on informed me, that he had made the bargain for Gold&s;mith, and the price was &s;ixty pounds. <Q REND="inline">"And, Sir, (&s;aid he) a &s;ufficient price too, when it was &s;old; for then the fame of Gold&s;mith had not been elevated, as it afterwards was, by his 'Traveller;' and the book&s;eller had &s;uch faint hopes of profit by his bargain, that he kept the manu&s;cript by him a long time, and did not publi&s;h it till after the Traveller had appeared. Then, to be &s;ure, it was accidentally worth more money."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Piozzi<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Anecdotes of John&s;on, p. 119.</NOTE> and Sir John Hawkins<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Life of John&s;on, p. 420.</NOTE> have &s;trangely mi&s;-&s;tated the hi&s;tory of Gold&s;mith's &s;ituation and John&s;on's friendly interference, when this novel was &s;old. I &s;hall give it authentically from John&s;on's own exact narration:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I received one morning a me&s;&s;age from poor Gold&s;mith that he was in great di&s;tre&s;s, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;ent him a guinea, and promi&s;ed to come to him directly. I accordingly went as &s;oon as I was dre&s;t, and found that his landlady had arre&s;ted him for his rent, at which he was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion. I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a gla&s;s before him. I put the cork into the bottle, de&s;ired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the pre&s;s, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and &s;aw its merit; told the landlady I &s;hould &s;oon return, and having gone to a book&s;eller, &s;old it for &s;ixty pounds. I brought Gold&s;mith the money, and he di&s;charged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having u&s;ed him &s;o ill <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">It may not be improper to annex here Mrs. Piozzi's account of this tran&s;action, in her own words, as a &s;pecimen of the extreme inaccuracy with which all her anecdotes of Dr. John&s;on are related, or rather di&s;coloured and di&s;torted. <Q REND="inline">"I have forgotten the year, but it could &s;carcely I think be later than 1765 or 1766, that he was <HI>called abruptly from our hou&s;e after dinner,</HI> and returning <HI>in about three hours,</HI> &s;aid he had been with an enraged authour, who&s;e landlady pre&s;&s;ed him for payment within doors, while the bailiffs be&s;et him without; that he was <HI>drinking him&s;elf drunk</HI> with Madeira, to drown care, and fretting over a novel, which, when <HI>fini&s;hed,</HI> was to be his <HI>whole fortune,</HI> but <HI>he could not get it done for di&s;traction,</HI> nor could he &s;tep out of doors to offer it for &s;ale. Mr. John&s;on, therefore, &s;et away the bottle, and went to the book&s;eller, recom|mending the performance, and <HI>de&s;iring &s;ome immediate relief;</HI> which when he brought back to the writer, <HI>he called the woman of the hou&s;e directly to partake of punch, and pa&s;s their time in merri|ment."</HI></Q> <BIBL>Anecdotes of John&s;on, p. 119.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>My next meeting with John&s;on was on Friday the 1&s;t of July, when he and I and Dr. Gold&s;mith &s;upped together at the Mitre. I was before this time pretty well acquainted with Gold&s;mith, who was one of the brighte&s;t
<PB N="226" REF="257" MS="y"> ornaments of the John&s;onian &s;chool. Gold&s;mith's re&s;pectful attachment to John&s;on was then at its height; for his own literary reputation had not yet di&s;tingui&s;hed him &s;o much as to excite a vain de&s;ire of competition with his great ma&s;ter. He had increa&s;ed my admiration of the goodne&s;s of John&s;on's heart, by incidental remarks in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, &s;uch as, when I mentioned Mr. Levet, whom he entertained under his roof, <Q REND="inline">"He is poor and hone&s;t, which is recommendation enough to John&s;on;"</Q> and when I wondered that he was very kind to a man of whom I had heard a very bad character, <Q REND="inline">"He is now become mi&s;erable, and that in&s;ures the protection of John&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith attempted this evening to maintain, I &s;uppo&s;e from an affectation of paradox, that knowledge was not de&s;irable on its own account, for it often was a &s;ource of unhappine&s;s. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that knowledge may in &s;ome ca&s;es produce unhappine&s;s, I allow. But, upon the whole, know|ledge <HI>per &s;e</HI> is certainly an object which every man would wi&s;h to attain, although, perhaps, he may not take the trouble nece&s;&s;ary for attaining it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John Campbell, the celebrated political and biographical writer, being mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Campbell is a man of much knowledge, and has a good &s;hare of imagination. His 'Hermippus Redivivus' is very enter|taining, as an account of the Hermetick philo&s;ophy, and as furni&s;hing a curious hi&s;tory of the extravagancies of the human mind. If it were merely imaginary, it would be nothing at all. Campbell is not always rigidly careful of truth in his conver&s;ation; but I do not believe there is any thing of this carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in his books. Campbell is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the in&s;ide of a church for many years <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">I am inclined to think that he was mi&s;informed as to this circum&s;tance. I own I am jealous for my worthy friend Dr. John Campbell. For though Milton could without remor&s;e ab&s;ent him|&s;elf from publick wor&s;hip, I cannot. On the contrary, I have the &s;ame habitual impre&s;&s;ions upon my mind, with tho&s;e of a truly venerable Judge, who &s;aid to Mr. Langton, <Q REND="inline">"Friend Langton, if I have not been at church on Sunday, I do not feel my&s;elf ea&s;y."</Q> Dr. Campbell was a &s;incerely religious man. Lord Macartney, who is eminent for his variety of knowledge, and attention to men of talents, and knew him well, told me, that when he called on him in a morning, he found him reading a chapter in the Greek New Te&s;tament, which he informed his Lord&s;hip was his con|&s;tant practice. The quantity of Dr. Campbell's compo&s;ition is almo&s;t incredible, and his labours brought him large profits. Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton told me that John&s;on &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">"He is the riche&s;t authour that ever grazed the common of literature."</Q></NOTE>; but he never pa&s;&s;es a church without pulling off his hat. This &s;hews that he has good principles. I u&s;ed to go pretty often to Campbell's on a Sunday even|ing, till I began to con&s;ider that the &s;hoals of Scotchmen who flocked about
<PB N="227" REF="258">
him might probably &s;ay, when any thing of mine was well done, 'Ay, ay, he has learnt this of CAWMELL!"</Q></P>
<P>He talked very contemptuou&s;ly of Churchill's poetry, ob&s;erving, that <Q REND="inline">"it had a temporary currency, only from its audacity of abu&s;e, and being filled with living names, and that it would &s;ink into oblivion."</Q> I ventured to hint that he was not quite a fair judge, as Churchill had attacked him violently. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I am a very fair judge. He did not attack me violently till he found I did not like his poetry; and his attack on me &s;hall not prevent me from continuing to &s;ay what I think of him, from an appre|hen&s;ion that it may be a&s;cribed to re&s;entment. No, Sir, I called the fellow a blockhead at fir&s;t, and I will call him a blockhead &s;till. However, I will acknowledge that I have a better opinion of him now, than I once had; for he has &s;hewn more fertility than I expected. To be &s;ure, he is a tree that cannot produce good fruit: he only bears crabs. But, Sir, a tree that produces a great many crabs is better than a tree which produces only a few."</Q></P>
<P>In this depreciation of Churchill's poetry I could not agree with him. It is very true that the greate&s;t part of it is upon the topicks of the day, on which account, as it brought him great fame and profit at the time, it mu&s;t proportionally &s;lide out of the publick attention as other occa&s;ional objects &s;ucceed. But Churchill had extraordinary vigour both of thought and expre&s;|&s;ion. His portraits of the players will ever be valuable to the true lovers of the drama; and his &s;trong caricatures of &s;everal eminent men of his age, will not be forgotten by the curious. Let me add, that there are in his works many pa&s;&s;ages which are of a general nature; and his <Q REND="inline">"Prophecy of Famine"</Q> is a poem of no ordinary merit. It is, indeed, fal&s;ely injurious to Scotland; but therefore may be allowed a greater &s;hare of invention.</P>
<P>Bonnel Thornton had ju&s;t publi&s;hed a burle&s;que <Q REND="inline">"Ode on St. Cecilia's day, adapted to the ancient Briti&s;h mu&s;ick, viz. the &s;alt-box, the Jew's-harp, the marrow-bones and cleaver, the hum-&s;trum or hurdy-gurdy, &amp;c."</Q> John&s;on prai&s;ed its humour, and &s;eemed much diverted with it. He repeated the following pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"In &s;trains more exalted the &s;alt-box &s;hall join,</L>
<L>"And clattering and battering and clapping combine&punc;</L>
<L>"With a rap and a tap, while the hollow &s;ide &s;ounds,</L>
<L>"Up and down leaps the flap, and with rattling rebounds."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="228" REF="259" MS="y">
 I mentioned the periodical paper called THE CONNOISSEUR. He &s;aid it wanted matter.&mdash;No doubt it has not the deep thinking of John&s;on's writings. But &s;urely it has ju&s;t views of the &s;urface of life, and a very &s;prightly man|ner. His opinion of THE WORLD was not much higher than of the Con|noi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>Let me here apologize for the imperfect manner in which I am obliged to exhibit John&s;on's conver&s;ation at this period. In the early part of my acquaint|ance with him, I was &s;o wrapt in admiration of his extraordinary colloquial talents, and &s;o little accu&s;tomed to his peculiar mode of expre&s;&s;ion, that I found it extremely difficult to recollect and record his conver&s;ation with its genuine vigour and vivacity. In progre&s;s of time, when my mind was, at it were, &s;trongly impregnated with the John&s;onian aether, I could, with much more facility and exactne&s;s, carry in my memory and commit to paper the exuberant variety of his wi&s;dom and wit.</P>
<P>At this time Mi&s;s Williams, as &s;he was then called, though &s;he did not re&s;ide with him in the Temple under his roof, but had lodgings in Bolt-court, Fleet-&s;treet, had &s;o much of his attention, that he every night drank tea with her before he went home, however late it might be, and &s;he always &s;at up for him. This, it may be fairly conjectured, was not alone a proof of his regard for her, but of his own unwillingne&s;s to go into &s;olitude before that un&s;ea&s;onable hour at which he had habituated him&s;elf to expect the oblivion of repo&s;e. Dr. Gold&s;mith, being a privileged man, went with him this night, &s;trutting away, and calling to me with an air of &s;uperiority, like that of an e&s;oterick over an exoterick di&s;ciple of a &s;age of antiquity, <Q REND="inline">"I go to Mi&s;s Williams."</Q> I confe&s;s, I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which he &s;eemed &s;o proud; but it was not long before I obtained the &s;ame mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 5th of July, I again vi&s;ited John&s;on. He told me he had looked into the poems of a certain pretty voluminous modern writer, which had lately come out, but could find no thinking in them. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is there not imagination in them, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, there is in them what <HI>was</HI> imagination, but it is no more imagination in <HI>him,</HI> than &s;ound is &s;ound in the echo. And his diction too is not his own. We have long ago &s;een <HI>white|robed innocence,</HI> and <HI>flower-be&s;pangled meads."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Talking of London, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you wi&s;h to have a ju&s;t notion of the magnitude of this city, you mu&s;t not be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing its great &s;treets and &s;quares, but mu&s;t &s;urvey the innumerable little lanes and courts. It is not in the &s;hewy evolutions of buildings, but in the multiplicity of human
<PB N="229" REF="260" MS="y">
habitations which are crouded together, that the wonderful immen&s;ity of London con&s;i&s;ts."</Q>&mdash;I have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf with thinking how different a place London is to different people. They, who&s;e narrow minds are con|tracted to the con&s;ideration of &s;ome one particular pur&s;uit, view it only through that medium. A politician thinks of it merely as the &s;eat of government in its different departments; a grazier, as a va&s;t market for cattle; a mercantile man, as a place where a prodigious deal of bu&s;ine&s;s is done upon 'Change; a dramatick enthu&s;ia&s;t, as the grand &s;cene of theatrical entertainments; a man of plea&s;ure, as an a&s;&s;emblage of taverns, and the great emporium for ladies of ea&s;y virtue. But the intellectual man is &s;truck with it, as compre|hending the whole of human life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, July 6, he was engaged to &s;up with me at my lodgings in Downing-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter. But on the preceding night my landlord having behaved very rudely to me and &s;ome company who were with me, I had re&s;olved not to remain another night in his hou&s;e. I was exceedingly unea&s;y at the aukward appearance I &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould make to John&s;on and the other gentlemen whom I had invited, not being able to receive them at home, and being obliged to order &s;upper at the Mitre. I went to John&s;on in the morning, and talked of it as of a &s;erious di&s;tre&s;s. He laughed, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Con&s;ider, Sir, how in&s;ignificant this will appear a twelvemonth hence."</Q>&mdash;Were this con&s;ideration to be applied to mo&s;t of the little vexatious incidents of life, by which our quiet is too often di&s;turbed, it would prevent many painful &s;en&s;ations. I have tried it frequently, with good effect. <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing (continued he) in this mighty misfortune; nay, we &s;hall be better at the Mitre."</Q> I told him that I had been at Sir John Fielding's office, complaining of my landlord, and had been informed, that though I had taken my lodgings for a year, I might, upon proof of his bad behaviour, quit them when I plea&s;ed, without being under an obligation to pay rent for any longer time than while I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. The fertility of John&s;on's mind could &s;hew it&s;elf even upon &s;o &s;mall a matter as this. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) I &s;uppo&s;e this mu&s;t be the law, &s;ince you have been told &s;o in Bow-&s;treet. But, if your landlord could hold you to your bargain, and the lodgings &s;hould be yours for a year, you may certainly u&s;e them as you think fit. So, Sir, you may quarter two life-guardmen upon him; or you may &s;end the greate&s;t &s;coundrel you can find into your apartments; or you may &s;ay that you want to make &s;ome experiments in natural philo&s;ophy, and may burn a large quantity of a&s;&s;afoetida in his hou&s;e."</Q></P>

 I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great &s;ubject of this work to be lo&s;t. Though a &s;mall particular may appear trifling to &s;ome, it will be reli&s;hed by others, while every little &s;park adds &s;omething to the general blaze. And to plea&s;e the true, candid, warm admirers of John&s;on, and in any degree increa&s;e the &s;plendour of his reputa|tion, I bid defiance to the &s;hafts of ridicule, or even of malignity; thou&s;ands of them have been di&s;charged at my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> yet it &s;till &s;ails unhurt <Q REND="inline">"along the &s;tream of time,"</Q> and as an attendant upon John&s;on,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pur&s;ues the triumph, and partakes the gale."</Q></P>
<P>I had as my gue&s;ts this evening at the Mitre tavern, Dr. John&s;on, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Mr. Thomas Davies, Mr. Eccles, an Iri&s;h gentleman, for who&s;e agreeable company I was obliged to Mr. Davies, and the Reverend Mr. Ogilvie, a Scotch clergyman, authour of &s;everal poems, who was very de&s;irous of being in company with my illu&s;trious friend, while I, in my turn, was proud to have the honour of &s;hewing one of my countrymen upon what ea&s;y terms John&s;on permitted me to live with him.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith, as u&s;ual, endeavoured, with too much eagerne&s;s, to &s;hine, and di&s;puted very warmly with John&s;on again&s;t the well-known maxim of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, <Q REND="inline">"the King can do no wrong;"</Q> affirming, that <Q REND="inline">"what was morally fal&s;e could not be politically true; and as the King might, in the exerci&s;e of his regal power, command and cau&s;e the doing of what was wrong, it certainly might be &s;aid, in &s;en&s;e and in rea&s;on, that he could do wrong."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are to con&s;ider, that in our con&s;titution, according to its true principles, the King is the head; he is &s;upreme; he is above every thing, and there is no power by which he can be tried. Therefore it is, Sir, that we hold the King can do no wrong, that whatever may happen to be wrong in government may not be above our reach, by being a&s;cribed to Maje&s;ty. Redre&s;s is always to be had again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, by puni&s;hing the immediate agents. The King, though he &s;hould command, cannot force a Judge to condemn a man unju&s;tly; therefore it is the Judge whom we pro&s;ecute and puni&s;h. Political in&s;titutions are formed upon the con&s;ideration of what will mo&s;t frequently tend to the good of the whole, although now and then exceptions may occur. Thus it is better in general that a nation &s;hould have a &s;upreme legi&s;lative power, although it may at times be abu&s;ed. And then, Sir, there is this con&s;ideration, that <HI>if the abu&s;e be enormous, Nature will ri&s;e up, and claiming her original rights, overturn a corrupt political &s;y&s;tem."</HI></Q> I mark this animated &s;entence with peculiar plea&s;ure, as a noble in&s;tance of that truly dignified &s;pirit of freedom which ever glowed in his heart, though he was
<PB N="231" REF="262" MS="y">
charged with &s;lavi&s;h tenets by &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, becau&s;e he was at all times indignant again&s;t that fal&s;e patrioti&s;m, that pretended love of freedom, that unruly re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;table authority of any good government.</P>
<P>This generous &s;entiment, which he uttered with great fervour, &s;truck me exceedingly, and &s;tirred my blood to that pitch of fancied re&s;i&s;tance, the po&s;&s;i|bility of which I am glad to keep in mind, but to which I tru&s;t I never &s;hall be forced.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Great abilities (&s;aid he) are not requi&s;ite for an Hi&s;torian; for in Hi&s;torical compo&s;ition, all the greate&s;t powers of the human mind are quie&s;cent. He has facts ready to his hand; &s;o there is no exerci&s;e of invention. Imagination is not required in any high degree; only about as much as is u&s;ed in the lower kinds of poetry. Some penetration, accuracy, and colouring will fit a man for the ta&s;k, if he can give the application which is nece&s;&s;ary."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Bayle's Dictionary is a very u&s;eful work for tho&s;e to con&s;ult who love the biographical part of literature, which is what I love mo&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne's reign, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"I think Dr. Arbuthnot the fir&s;t man among them. He was the mo&s;t univer&s;al genius, being an excellent phy&s;ician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour. Mr. Addi&s;on was, to be &s;ure, a great man; his learning was not profound; but his morality, his humour, and his elegance of writing, &s;et him very high."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Ogilvie was unlucky enough to choo&s;e for the topick of his conver&s;a|tion the prai&s;es of his native country. He began with &s;aying, that there was very rich land round Edinburgh. Gold&s;mith, who had &s;tudied phy&s;ick there, contradicted this, very untruly, with a &s;neering laugh. Di&s;concerted a little by this, Mr. Ogilvie then took new ground, where, I &s;uppo&s;e, he thought him|&s;elf perfectly &s;afe; for he ob&s;erved, that Scotland had a great many noble wild pro&s;pects. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, you have a great many. Norway, too, has noble wild pro&s;pects; and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild pro&s;pects. But, Sir, let me tell you, the noble&s;t pro&s;pect which a Scotchman ever &s;ees, is the high road that leads him to England!"</Q> This unexpected and pointed &s;ally produced a roar of applau&s;e. After all, how|ever, tho&s;e, who admire the rude grandeur of Nature, cannot deny it to Caledonia.</P>
<P>On Saturday, July 9, I found John&s;on &s;urrounded with a numerous levee, but have not pre&s;erved any part of his conver&s;ation. On the 14th we had another evening by our&s;elves at the Mitre. It happening to be a very rainy
<PB N="232" REF="263" MS="y"> night, I made &s;ome common-place ob&s;ervations on the relaxation of nerves and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits which &s;uch weather occa&s;ioned; adding&punc; however, that it was good for the vegetable creation. John&s;on, who, as we have already &s;een, denied that the temperature of the air had any influence on the human frame, an&s;wered, with a &s;mile of ridicule, <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir, it is good for vegetables, and for the animals who eat tho&s;e animals."</Q> This ob&s;ervation of his aptly enough introduced a good &s;upper; and I &s;oon forgot, in John&s;on's company, the influence of a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Feeling my&s;elf now quite at ea&s;e as his companion, though I had all po&s;&s;i|ble reverence for him, I expre&s;&s;ed a regret that I could not be &s;o ea&s;y with my father, though he was not much older than him, and certainly had not more learning and greater abilities to depre&s;s me. I a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of this. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in &s;ome degree, the colour of the world as it moves along. Your father is a Judge in a remote part of the i&s;land, and all his notions are taken from the old world. Be&s;ides, Sir, there mu&s;t always be a &s;truggle between a father and &s;on, while one aims at power and the other at independence."</Q> I &s;aid, I was afraid my father would force me to be a lawyer. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you need not be afraid of his forcing you to be a laborious practi&s;ing lawyer; that is not in his power. For as the proverb &s;ays, 'One man may lead a hor&s;e to the water, but twenty cannot make him drink.' He may be di&s;plea&s;ed that you are not what he wi&s;hes you to be; but that di&s;plea&s;ure will not go far. If he in&s;i&s;ts only on your having as much law as is nece&s;&s;ary for a man of property, and then endeavours to get you into Parliament, he is quite in the right."</Q></P>

<P>It will be ob&s;erved, that when giving me advice as to my travels, Dr. John&s;on did not dwell upon cities, and palaces, and pictures, and &s;hews, and Arcadian &s;cenes.

<P>Sir David Dalrymple, now one of the Judges of Scotland by the title of Lord Hailes, had contributed much to increa&s;e my high opinion of John&s;on, on account of his writings, long before I attained to a per&s;onal acquaintance with him; I, in return, had informed John&s;on of Sir David's eminent cha|racter for learning and religion; and John&s;on was &s;o much plea&s;ed, that at one of our evening meetings he gave him for his toa&s;t. I at this time kept up a very frequent corre&s;pondence with Sir David; and I read to Dr. John&s;on to-night the following pa&s;&s;age from the letter which I had la&s;t received from him:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It gives me plea&s;ure to think that you have obtained the friend&s;hip of Mr. Samuel John&s;on. He is one of the be&s;t moral writers which England has produced.

<P>He recommended to me to keep a journal of my life, full and unre&s;erved. He &s;aid it would be a very good exerci&s;e, and would yield me great &s;atisfac|tion when the particulars were faded from my remembrance. I was uncom|monly fortunate in having had a previous coincidence of opinion with him upon this &s;ubject, for I had kept &s;uch a journal for &s;ome time; and it was no &s;mall plea&s;ure to me to have this to tell him, and to receive his approba|tion. He coun&s;elled me to keep it private, and &s;aid I might &s;urely have a friend who would burn it in ca&s;e of my death. From this habit I have been enabled to give the world &s;o many anecdotes, which would otherwi&s;e have been lo&s;t to po&s;terity. I mentioned that I was afraid I put into my journal too many little incidents. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing, Sir, too little for &s;o little a creature as man.

 Next morning Mr. Demp&s;ter happened to call on me, and was &s;o much &s;truck even with the imperfect account which I gave him of Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation, that to his honour be it recorded, when I complained that drink|ing port and &s;itting up late with him, affected my nerves for &s;ome time after, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"One had better be pal&s;ied at eighteen, than not keep company with &s;uch a man."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, July 18, I found tall Sir Thomas Robin&s;on &s;itting with John&s;on. Sir Thomas &s;aid, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia valued him&s;elf upon three things;&mdash;upon being a hero, a mu&s;ician, and an authour. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Pretty well, Sir, for one man. As to his being an authour, I have not looked at his poetry; but his pro&s;e is poor &s;tuff. He writes ju&s;t as you might &s;uppo&s;e Voltaire's footboy to do, who has been his amanuen&s;is. He has &s;uch parts as the valet might have, and about as much of the colouring of the &s;tyle as might be got by tran&s;cribing his works."</Q> When I was at Ferney, I repeated this to Voltaire, in order to reconcile him &s;omewhat to John&s;on, whom he, in affecting the Engli&s;h mode of expre&s;&s;ion, had previou&s;ly charac|teri&s;ed as <Q REND="inline">"a &s;uper&s;titious dog;"</Q> but after hearing &s;uch a critici&s;m on Frederick the Great, with whom he was then on bad terms, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"An hone&s;t fellow!"</Q></P>
<P>But I think the critici&s;m much too &s;evere; for the <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of the Hou&s;e of Brandenburgh"</Q> are written as well as many works of that kind. His poetry, for the &s;tyle of which he him&s;elf makes a frank apology, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Jargonnant un Fran&ccedil;ois barbare,"</HI></Q> though fraught with pernicious ravings of infidelity, has, in many places, great animation, and in &s;ome a pathetick tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this contemptuous animadver&s;ion on the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, I ob&s;erved to John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"It would &s;eem then, Sir, that much le&s;s parts are nece&s;&s;ary to make a King, than to make an Authour; for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is confe&s;&s;edly the greate&s;t King now in Europe, yet you think he makes a very poor figure as an Authour."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Levet this day &s;hewed me Dr. John&s;on's library, which was contained in two garrets over his Chambers, where Lintot, &s;on of the celebrated book|&s;eller of that name, had formerly his printing-hou&s;e. I found a number of good books, but very du&s;ty and in great confu&s;ion. The floor was &s;trewed with manu&s;cript leaves, in John&s;on's own hand-writing, which I beheld with a degree of veneration, &s;uppo&s;ing they perhaps might contain portions of the Rambler, or of Ra&s;&s;elas. I ob&s;erved an apparatus for chymical experiments, of which John&s;on was all his life very fond. The place &s;eemed to be very favourable for retirement and meditation. John&s;on told me, that he went up
<PB N="237" REF="268" MS="y">
thither without mentioning it to his &s;ervant, when he wanted to &s;tudy, &s;ecure from interruption; for he would not allow his &s;ervant to &s;ay he was not at home when he really was. <Q REND="inline">"A &s;ervant's &s;trict regard for truth, (&s;aid he) mu&s;t be weakened by &s;uch a practice. A philo&s;opher may know that it is merely a form of denial; but few &s;ervants are &s;uch nice di&s;tingui&s;hers. If I accu&s;tom a &s;ervant to tell a lye for <HI>me,</HI> have I not rea&s;on to apprehend that he will tell many lies for <HI>him&s;elf?"</HI></Q> I am, however, &s;atisfied that every &s;ervant, of any degree of intelligence, under&s;tands &s;aying his ma&s;ter is not at home, not at all as the affirmation of a fact, but as cu&s;tomary words, intimating that his ma&s;ter wi&s;hes not to be &s;een; &s;o that there can be no bad effect from it.</P>
<P>Mr. Temple, now vicar of St. Gluvias, Cornwall, who had been my inti|mate friend for many years, had at this time chambers in Farrar's-buildings, at the bottom of Inner Temple-lane, which he kindly lent me upon my quitting my lodgings, he being to return to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. I found them particularly convenient for me, as they were &s;o near Dr. John&s;on's.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, July 20, Dr. John&s;on, Mr. Demp&s;ter, and my uncle Dr. Bo&s;well, who happened to be now in London, &s;upped with me at the&s;e Chambers.

<P>Mr. Alexander Donald&s;on, book&s;eller of Edinburgh, had for &s;ome time opened a &s;hop in London, and &s;old his cheap editions of the mo&s;t popular Engli&s;h books, in defiance of the &s;uppo&s;ed common-law right of <HI>Literary Property.</HI> John&s;on, though he concurred in the opinion which was afterwards &s;anctioned by a decree from the Hou&s;e of Lords, that there was no &s;uch right, was at this time very angry that the book&s;ellers of London, for whom he uniformly profe&s;&s;ed much regard, &s;hould &s;uffer from an inva&s;ion of what they had ever con&s;idered to be &s;ecure, and he was loud and violent again&s;t Mr. Donald&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"He is a fellow who takes advantage of the law to injure his brethren; for, notwith&s;tanding that the &s;tatute &s;ecures only fourteen years of exclu&s;ive right, it has always been under&s;tood by the trade, that he, who buys the copy-right of a book from the authour, obtains a perpetual property; and
<PB N="238" REF="269" MS="y">
 upon that belief, numberle&s;s bargains are made to transfer that property after the expiration of the &s;tatutory term. Now Donald&s;on, I &s;ay, takes advantage here, of people who have really an equitable title from u&s;age; and if we con|&s;ider how few of the books, of which they buy the property, &s;ucceed &s;o well as to bring profit, we &s;hould be of opinion that the term of fourteen years is too &s;hort; it &s;hould be &s;ixty years."</Q> DEMPSTER. <Q REND="inline">"Donald&s;on, Sir, is anxious for the encouragement of literature. He reduces the price of books, &s;o that poor &s;tudents may buy them."</Q> JOHNSON, (laughing.) <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, allowing that to be his motive, he is no better than Robin Hood, who robbed the rich in order to give to the poor."</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that when the great que&s;tion concerning Literary Property came to be ultimately tried before the &s;upreme tribunal of this country, in con&s;equence of the very &s;pirited exertions of Mr. Donald&s;on, Dr. John&s;on was zealous again&s;t a perpetuity; but he thought that the term of the exclu|&s;ive right of authours &s;hould be con&s;iderably enlarged. He was then for grant|ing a hundred years.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now turned upon Mr. David Hume's &s;tyle. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, his &s;tyle is not Engli&s;h; the &s;tructure of his &s;entences is French. Now the French &s;tructure and the Engli&s;h &s;tructure may, in the nature of things, be equally good. But if you allow that the Engli&s;h language is e&s;tabli&s;hed, he is wrong.

<P>Rou&s;&s;eau's treati&s;e on the inequality of mankind was at this time a fa&s;hion|able topick. It gave ri&s;e to an ob&s;ervation by Mr. Demp&s;ter, that the advantages of fortune and rank were nothing to a wi&s;e man, who ought to value only merit. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"If man were a &s;avage, living in the woods by him&s;elf, this might be true; but in civili&s;ed &s;ociety we all depend upon each other, and our happine&s;s is very much owing to the good opinion of mankind. Now, Sir, in civili&s;ed &s;ociety, external advantages make us more re&s;pected. A man with a good coat upon his back meets with a better recep|tion than he who has a bad one. Sir, you may analy&s;e this, and &s;ay what is there in it? But that will avail you nothing, for it is a part of a general &s;y&s;tem. Pound St. Paul's church into atoms, and con&s;ider any &s;ingle atom; it is, to be &s;ure, good for nothing: but, put all the&s;e atoms together, and you have St. Paul's church. So it is with human felicity, which is made up of many ingredients, each of which may be &s;hewn to be very in&s;ignificant. In civili&s;ed &s;ociety, per&s;onal merit will not &s;erve you &s;o much as money will.
<PB N="239" REF="270" MS="y">
Sir, you may make the experiment. Go into the &s;treet, and give one man a lecture on morality, and another a &s;hilling, and &s;ee which will re&s;pect you mo&s;t. If you wi&s;h only to &s;upport nature, Sir William Petty fixes your allowance at three pounds a year; but as times are much altered, let us call it &s;ix pounds. This &s;um will fill your belly, &s;helter you from the weather, and even get you a &s;trong la&s;ting coat, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be made of good bull's hide. Now, Sir, all beyond this is artificial, and is de&s;ired in order to obtain a greater degree of re&s;pect from our fellow-creatures. And, Sir, if &s;ix hun|dred pounds a year procure a man more con&s;equence, and, of cour&s;e, more happine&s;s than &s;ix pounds a year, the &s;ame proportion will hold as to &s;ix thou|&s;and, and &s;o on as far as opulence can be carried. Perhaps he who has a large fortune may not be &s;o happy as he who has a &s;mall one; but that mu&s;t proceed from other cau&s;es than from his having the large fortune: for, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> he who is rich in a civilized &s;ociety, mu&s;t be happier than he who is poor; as riches, if properly u&s;ed, (and it is a man's own fault if they are not,) mu&s;t be productive of the highe&s;t advantages. Money, to be &s;ure, of it&s;elf is of no u&s;e; for its only u&s;e is to part with it. Rou&s;&s;eau, and all tho&s;e who deal in paradoxes, are led away by a childi&s;h de&s;ire of novelty. When I was a boy, I u&s;ed always to choo&s;e the wrong &s;ide of a debate, becau&s;e mo&s;t ingenious things, that is to &s;ay, mo&s;t new things, could be &s;aid upon it. Sir, there is nothing for which you may not mu&s;ter up more plau|&s;ible arguments, than tho&s;e which are urged again&s;t wealth and other external advantages. Why now, there is &s;tealing; why &s;hould it be thought a crime? When we con&s;ider by what unju&s;t methods property has been often acquired, and that what was unju&s;tly got it mu&s;t be unju&s;t to keep, where is the harm in one man's taking the property of another from him? Be&s;ides, Sir, when we con&s;ider the bad u&s;e that many people make of their property, and how much better u&s;e the thief may make of it, it may be defended as a very allowable practice. Yet, Sir, the experience of mankind has di&s;covered &s;tealing to be &s;o very bad a thing, that they make no &s;cruple to hang a man for it. When I was running about this town a very poor fellow, I was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty; but I was, at the &s;ame time, very &s;orry to be poor. Sir, all the arguments which are brought to repre&s;ent poverty as no evil, &s;hew it to be evidently a great evil. You never find people labouring to convince you that you may live very happily upon a plen|tiful fortune.&mdash;So you hear people talking how mi&s;erable a king mu&s;t be; and yet they all wi&s;h to be in his place."</Q></P>
<P>It was &s;ugge&s;ted that kings mu&s;t be unhappy, becau&s;e they are deprived of the greate&s;t of all &s;atisfactions, ea&s;y and unre&s;erved &s;ociety. JOHNSON.
<PB N="240" REF="271" MS="y"> <Q REND="inline">"That is an ill-founded notion. Being a king does not exclude a man from &s;uch &s;ociety. Great kings have always been &s;ocial. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the only great king at pre&s;ent, is very &s;ocial. Charles the Second, the la&s;t King of England who was a man of parts, was &s;ocial; and our Henrys and Edwards were all &s;ocial."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Demp&s;ter having endeavoured to maintain that intrin&s;ick merit <HI>ought</HI> to make the only di&s;tinction among&s;t mankind. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, man|kind have found that this cannot be. How &s;hall we determine the proportion o&s; intrin&s;ick merit? Were that to be the only di&s;tinction among&s;t mankind, we &s;hould &s;oon quarrel about the degrees of it. Were all di&s;tinctions aboli&s;hed, the &s;tronge&s;t would not long acquie&s;ce, but would endeavour to obtain a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uperiority by their bodily &s;trength. But, Sir, as &s;ubordination is very nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;ociety, and contentions for &s;uperiority very dangerous, mankind, that is to &s;ay all civili&s;ed nations, have &s;ettled it upon a plain invariable prin|ciple. A man is born to hereditary rank; or his being appointed to certain offices, gives him a certain rank. Subordination tends greatly to human hap|pine&s;s. Were we all upon an equality, we &s;hould have no other enjoyment than mere animal plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, I con&s;idered di&s;tinction of rank to be of &s;o much importance in civili&s;ed &s;ociety, that if I were a&s;ked on the &s;ame day to dine with the fir&s;t duke in England, and with the fir&s;t man in Britain for genius, I &s;hould he&s;i|tate which to prefer. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir, if you were to dine only once, and it were never to be known where you dined, you would choo&s;e rather to dine with the fir&s;t man for genius; but to gain mo&s;t re&s;pect, you &s;hould dine with the fir&s;t duke in England. For nine people in ten that you meet with, would have a higher opinion of you for having dined with a duke; and the great genius him&s;elf would receive you better, becau&s;e you had been with the great duke."</Q></P>
<P>He took care to guard him&s;elf again&s;t any po&s;&s;ible &s;u&s;picion that his &s;ettled principles of reverence for rank and re&s;pect for wealth were at all owing to mean or intere&s;ted motives; for he a&s;&s;erted his own independence as a literary man. <Q REND="inline">"No man (&s;aid he) who ever lived by literature, has lived more independently than I have done."</Q> He &s;aid he had taken longer time than he needed to have done in compo&s;ing his Dictionary. He received our com|pliments upon that great work with complacency, and told us that the Academy <HI>della Cru&s;ca</HI> could &s;carcely believe that it was done by one man.</P>
<P>Next morning I found him alone, and have pre&s;erved the following frag|ments of his conver&s;ation. Of a gentleman who was mentioned, he &s;aid,
<PB N="241" REF="272" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"I have not met with any man for a long time who has given me &s;uch general di&s;plea&s;ure. He is totally unfixed in his principles, and wants to puzzle other people."</Q> I &s;aid, his principles had been poi&s;oned by a noted infidel writer, but that he was, neverthele&s;s, a benevolent good man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We can have no dependance upon that in&s;tinctive, that con&s;titutional goodne&s;s which is not founded upon principle. I grant you that &s;uch a man may be a very amiable member of &s;ociety. I can conceive him placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation that he is not much tempted to deviate from what is right; and as every man prefers virtue when there is not &s;ome &s;trong incitement to tran&s;gre&s;s its pre|cepts, I can conceive him doing nothing wrong. But if &s;uch a man &s;tood in need of money, I &s;hould not like to tru&s;t him; and I &s;hould certainly not tru&s;t him with young ladies, for <HI>there</HI> there is always temptation. Hume, and other &s;ceptical innovators, are vain men, and will gratify them&s;elves at any expence. Truth will not afford &s;ufficient food to their vanity; &s;o they have betaken them&s;elves to errour. Truth, Sir, is a cow which will yield &s;uch people no more milk, and &s;o they are gone to milk the bull. If I could have allowed my&s;elf to gratify my vanity at the expence of truth, what fame might I have acquired. Every thing which Hume has advanced again&s;t Chri&s;tianity had pa&s;&s;ed through my mind long before he wrote. Always remember this, that after a &s;y&s;tem is well &s;ettled upon po&s;itive evidence, a few partial objec|tions ought not to &s;hake it. The human mind is &s;o limited, that it cannot take in all the parts of a &s;ubject, &s;o that there may be objections rai&s;ed again&s;t any thing. There are objections again&s;t a <HI>plenum,</HI> and objections again&s;t a <HI>vacuum;</HI> yet one of them mu&s;t certainly be true."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Hume's argument again&s;t the belief of miracles, that it is more probable that the witne&s;&s;es to the truth of them are mi&s;taken, or &s;peak fal&s;ely, than that the miracles &s;hould be true. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the great difficulty of proving miracles &s;hould make us very cautious in believing them. But let us con&s;ider; although GOD has made Nature to operate by certain fixed laws, yet it is not unrea&s;onable to think that he may &s;u&s;pend tho&s;e laws, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem highly advantageous to mankind. Now the Chri&s;tian religion is a mo&s;t beneficial &s;y&s;tem, as it gives us light and certainty where we were before in darkne&s;s and doubt. The miracles which prove it are atte&s;ted by men who had no intere&s;t in deceiving us; but who, on the contrary, were told that they &s;hould &s;uffer per&s;ecution, and did&punc;actually lay down their lives in confirmation of the truth of the facts which they a&s;&s;erted. Indeed, for &s;ome centuries the heathens did not pretend to deny the miracles; but &s;aid they were performed by the aid of evil &s;pirits. This
<PB N="242" REF="273" MS="y"> is a circum&s;tance of great weight. Then, Sir, when we take the proofs derived from prophecies which have been &s;o exactly fulfilled, we have mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence. Suppo&s;ing a miracle po&s;&s;ible, as to which, in my opinion, there can be no doubt, we have as &s;trong evidence for the miracles in &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity, as the nature of the thing admits."</Q></P>
<P>At night, Mr. John&s;on and I &s;upped in a private room at the Turk's Head coffee-hou&s;e, in the Strand. <Q REND="inline">"I encourage this hou&s;e (&s;aid he); for the mi&s;|tre&s;s of it is a good civil woman, and has not much bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir, I love the acquaintance of young people; becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, I don't like to think my&s;elf growing old. In the next place, young acquaintances mu&s;t la&s;t longe&s;t, if they do la&s;t; and then, Sir, young men have more virtue than old men; they have more generous &s;entiments in every re&s;pect. I love the young dogs of this age: they have more with and humour and knowledge of life than we had; but then the dogs are not &s;o good &s;cho|lars. Sir, in my early years I read very hard. It is a &s;ad reflection, but a true one, that I knew almo&s;t as much at eighteen as I do now. My judge|ment, to be &s;ure, was not &s;o good; but, I had all the facts. I remember very well, when I was at Oxford, an old gentleman &s;aid to me, 'Young man, ply your book diligently now, and acquire a &s;tock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an irk&s;ome ta&s;k."</Q></P>
<P>This account of his reading, given by him&s;elf in plain words, &s;ufficiently confirms what I have already advanced upon the di&s;puted que&s;tion as to his application. It reconciles any &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency in his way of talking upon it at different times; and &s;hews that idlene&s;s and reading hard were with him relative terms, the import of which, as u&s;ed by him, mu&s;t be gathered from a compari&s;on with what &s;cholars of different degrees of ardour and a&s;&s;iduity have been known to do. And let it be remembered, that he was now talking &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and expre&s;&s;ing his genuine &s;entiments; whereas at other times he might be induced from his &s;pirit of contradiction, or more properly from his love of argumentative conte&s;t, to &s;peak lightly of his own application to &s;tudy. It is plea&s;ing to con&s;ider that the old gentleman's gloomy prophecy as to the irk&s;omene&s;s of books to men of an advanced age, which is too often fulfilled, was &s;o far from being verified in John&s;on, that his ardour for literature never failed, and his la&s;t writings had more ea&s;e and vivacity than any of his earlier productions.</P>
<P>He mentioned to me now, for the fir&s;t time, that he had been di&s;tre&s;t by melancholy, and for that rea&s;on had been obliged to fly from &s;tudy and medi|tation,
<PB N="243" REF="274" MS="y">
to the di&s;&s;ipating variety of life. Again&s;t melancholy he recommended con&s;tant occupation of mind, a great deal of exerci&s;e, moderation in eating and drinking, and e&s;pecially to &s;hun drinking at night. He &s;aid melancholy people were apt to fly to intemperance for relief, but that it &s;unk them much deeper in mi&s;ery. He ob&s;erved, that labouring men who work hard, and live &s;paringly, are &s;eldom or never troubled with low &s;pirits.</P>
<P>He again in&s;i&s;ted on the duty of maintaining &s;ubordination of rank. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I would no more deprive a nobleman of his re&s;pect, than of his money. I con&s;ider my&s;elf as acting a part in the great &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety, and I do to others as I would have them to do to me. I would behave to a noble|man as I &s;hould expect he would behave to me, were I a nobleman and he Sam. John&s;on. Sir, there is one Mrs. Macaulay<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">This <HI>one</HI> Mrs. Macaulay was the &s;ame per&s;onage who afterwards made her&s;elf &s;o much known as <Q REND="inline">"the celebrated female hi&s;torian."</Q></NOTE> in this town, a great repub|lican. One day when I was at her hou&s;e, I put on a very grave countenance, and &s;aid to her, 'Madam, I am now become a convert to your way of think|ing. I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing; and to give you an unque&s;tionable proof, Madam, that I am in earne&s;t, here is a very &s;en&s;ible, civil, well-behaved fellow-citizen, your footman; I de&s;ire that he may be allowed to &s;it down and dine with us.' I thus, Sir, &s;hewed her the ab&s;urdity of the levelling doctrine. She has never liked me &s;ince. Sir, your levellers wi&s;h to level <HI>down</HI> as far as them&s;elves; but they cannot bear levelling <HI>up</HI> to them&s;elves. They would all have &s;ome people under them; why not then have &s;ome people above them?"</Q> I mentioned a certain authour who di&s;gu&s;ted me by his forwardne&s;s, and by &s;hewing no deference to noblemen into who&s;e company he was admitted. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;e a &s;hoemaker &s;hould claim an equality with him as he does with a Lord; how would he &s;tare. 'Why, Sir, do you &s;tare? (&s;ays the &s;hoemaker,) I do great &s;ervice to &s;ociety. 'Tis true, I am paid for doing it; but &s;o are you, Sir: and I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, better paid than I am, for doing &s;omething not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. For man|kind could do better without your books, than without my &s;hoes.' Thus, Sir, there would be a perpetual &s;truggle for precedence, were there no fixed invariable rules for the di&s;tinction of rank, which creates no jealou&s;y, as it is allowed to be accidental."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton was a very agreeable man, and his <Q REND="inline">"E&s;&s;ay on the Genius and Writings of Pope,"</Q> a very plea&s;ing book. I wondered that he delayed &s;o long to give us the continuation of it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why,
<PB N="244" REF="275" MS="y"> Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e he finds him&s;elf a little di&s;appointed, in not having been able to per&s;uade the world to be of his opinion as to Pope."</Q></P>
<P>We have now been favoured with the concluding volume, in which, to u&s;e a parliamentary expre&s;&s;ion, he has <HI>explained,</HI> &s;o as not to appear quite &s;o adver&s;e to the opinion of the world concerning Pope, as was at fir&s;t thought; and we mu&s;t all agree, that his work is a mo&s;t valuable acce&s;&s;ion to Engli&s;h literature.</P>
<P>A writer of de&s;erved eminence being mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he is a man of good parts, but being originally poor, he has got a love of mean company and low jocularity; a very bad thing, Sir. To laugh is good, as to talk is good. But you ought no more to think it enough if you laugh, than you are to think it enough if you talk. You may laugh in as many ways as you talk; and &s;urely <HI>every</HI> way of talking that is practi&s;ed can|not be e&s;teemed."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;poke of Sir James Macdonald as a young man of mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, who united the highe&s;t reputation at Eton and Oxford, with the patri|archal &s;pirit of a great Highland Chieftain. I mentioned that Sir James had &s;aid to me, that he had never &s;een Mr. John&s;on, but he had a great re&s;pect for him, though at the &s;ame time it was mixed with &s;ome degree of terrour. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if he were to be acquainted with me, it might le&s;&s;en both."</Q></P>
<P>The mention of this gentleman led us to talk of the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland, to vi&s;it which he expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that then appeared to me a very romantick fancy, which I little thought would be afterwards realized. He told me, that his father had put Martin's account of tho&s;e i&s;lands into his hands when he was very young, and that he was highly plea&s;ed with it; that he was particularly &s;truck with the St. Kilda man's notion that the high church of Gla&s;gow had been hollowed out of a rock; a circum&s;tance to which old Mr. John&s;on had directed his attention. He &s;aid, he would go to the Hebrides with me, when I returned from my travels, unle&s;s &s;ome very good companion &s;hould offer when I was ab&s;ent, which he did not think probable; adding, <Q REND="inline">"There are few people to whom I take &s;o much to as you."</Q> And when I talked of my leaving England, he &s;aid, with a very affectionate air, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Bo&s;well, I &s;hould be very unhappy at parting, did I think we were not to meet again."</Q>&mdash;I cannot too often remind my readers, that although &s;uch in&s;tances of his kindne&s;s are doubtle&s;s very flattering to me, yet I hope my recording them will be a&s;cribed to a better motive than to vanity; for they afford unque&s;tionable evidence of his tenderne&s;s and complacency, which &s;ome, while they were forced to acknowledge his great powers, have been &s;o &s;trenuous to deny.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="276" MS="y">
He maintained, that a boy at &s;chool was the happie&s;t of human beings. I &s;upported a different opinion, from which I have never yet varied, that a man is happier; and I enlarged upon the anxiety and &s;ufferings which are endured at &s;chool. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Sir, a boy's being flogged is not &s;o &s;evere as a man's having the hi&s;s of the world again&s;t him. Men have a &s;olicitude about fame; and the greater &s;hare they have of it, the more afraid they are of lo&s;ing it."</Q> I &s;ilently a&s;ked my&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"Is it po&s;&s;ible that the great Samuel John&s;on really entertains any &s;uch apprehen&s;ion, and is not confident that his exalted fame is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a foundation never to be &s;haken?"</Q></P>
<P>He this evening drank a bumper to Sir David Dalrymple, as a man of worth, a &s;cholar, and a wit.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have (&s;aid he) never heard of him except from you; but let him know my opinion of him: for as he does not &s;hew him&s;elf much in the world, he &s;hould have the prai&s;e of the few who hear of him."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, July 26, I found Mr. John&s;on alone. It was a very wet day, and I again complained of the di&s;agreeable effects of &s;uch weather. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, this is all imagination, which phy&s;icians encourage; for man lives in air, as a fi&s;h lives in water; &s;o that if the atmo&s;phere pre&s;s heavy from above, there is an equal re&s;i&s;tance from below. To be &s;ure, bad weather is hard upon people who are obliged to be abroad; and men cannot labour &s;o well in the open air in bad weather, as in good: but, Sir, a &s;mith or a tailor, who&s;e work is within doors, will &s;urely do as much in rainy weather as in fair. Some very delicate frames, indeed, may be affected by wet weather, but not com|mon con&s;titutions."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the education of children; and I a&s;ked him what he thought was be&s;t to teach them fir&s;t. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is no matter what you teach them fir&s;t, any more than what leg you &s;hall put into your breeches fir&s;t. Sir, you may &s;tand di&s;puting which is be&s;t to put in fir&s;t, but in the mean time your breech is bare. Sir, while you are con&s;idering which of two things you &s;hould teach your child fir&s;t, another boy has learnt them both."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, July 28, we again &s;upped in private at the Turk's Head coffee-hou&s;e. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Swift has a higher reputation than he de&s;erves. His excellence is &s;trong &s;en&s;e; for his humour, though very well, is not remarkably good. I doubt whether the 'Tale of a Tub' be his; for he never owned it, and it is much above his u&s;ual manner <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">This opinion was given by him more at large at a &s;ub&s;equent period. See <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 32.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="277" MS="y"> <Q REND="inline">"Thom&s;on, I think, had as much of the poet about him as mo&s;t writers. Every thing appeared to him through the medium of his favourite pur&s;uit. He could not have viewed tho&s;e two candles burning but with a poetical eye."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Has not&mdash;a great deal of wit, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think &s;o, Sir. He is, indeed, continually attempting wit, but he fails. And I have no more plea&s;ure in hearing a man attempting wit and failing, than in &s;eeing a man trying to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it."</Q></P>
<P>He laughed heartily, when I mentioned to him a &s;aying of his concerning Mr. Thomas Sheridan, which Foote took a wicked plea&s;ure to circulate. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it mu&s;t have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now &s;ee him. Such an exce&s;s of &s;tupidity, Sir, is not in Nature."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So (&s;aid he,) I allowed him all his own merit."</Q></P>
<P>He now added, <Q REND="inline">"Sheridan cannot bear me. I bring his declamation to a point. I a&s;k him a plain que&s;tion, 'What do you mean to teach?' Be&s;ides, Sir, what influence can Mr. Sheridan have upon the language of this great country by his narrow exertions. Sir, it is burning a farthing candle at Dover, to &s;hew light at Calais."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a young man who was unea&s;y from thinking that he was very deficient in learning and knowledge, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"A man has no rea&s;on to com|plain who holds a middle place and has many below him; and perhaps he has not &s;ix of his years above him;&mdash;perhaps not one. Though he may not know any thing perfectly, the general ma&s;s of knowledge that he has acquired is con&s;iderable. Time will do for him all that is wanting."</Q></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then took a philo&s;ophical turn. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Human experience, which is con&s;tantly contradicting theory, is the great te&s;t of truth. A &s;y&s;tem, built upon the di&s;coveries of a great many minds, is always of more &s;trength, than what is produced by the mere workings of any one mind, which, of it&s;elf, can do little. There is not &s;o poor a book in the world but what would be a prodigious effort were it wrought out entirely by a &s;ingle mind, without the aid of prior inve&s;tigators. The French writers are &s;uper|ficial, becau&s;e they are not &s;cholars, and &s;o proceed upon the mere power of their own minds; and we &s;ee how very little power they have."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As to the Chri&s;tian religion, Sir, be&s;ides the &s;trong evidence which we have for it, there is a balance in its favour from the number of great men who have been convinced of its truth, after a &s;erious con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion. Grotius was an acute man, a lawyer, a man accu&s;tomed to examine
<PB N="247" REF="278" MS="y">
evinence, and he was convinced. Grotius was not a reclu&s;e, but a man of the world, who certainly had no bias to the &s;ide of religion. Sir I&s;aac Newton &s;et out an infidel, and came to be a very firm believer."</Q></P>
<P>He this evening again recommended to me to perambulate Spain <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">I fully intended to have followed advice of &s;uch weight; but having &s;taid much longer both in Germany and Italy than I propo&s;ed to do, and having al&s;o vi&s;ited Cor&s;ica, I found that I had exceeded the time allowed me by my father, and ha&s;tened to France in my way homewards.</NOTE>. I &s;aid it would amu&s;e him to get a letter from me dated at Salamancha. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I love the Univer&s;ity of Salamancha; for when the Spaniards were in doubt as to the lawfulne&s;s of their conquering America, the Univer&s;ity of Salamancha gave it as their opinion that it was not lawful."</Q> He &s;poke this with great emotion, and with that generous warmth which dictated the lines in his <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> again&s;t Spani&s;h encroachment.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my opinion of my friend Derrick as but a poor writer. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir, he is; but you are to con&s;ider that his being a literary man has got for him all that he has. It has made him King of Bath. Sir, he has nothing to &s;ay for him&s;elf but that he is a writer. Had he not been a writer, he mu&s;t have been &s;weeping the cro&s;&s;ings in the &s;treets, and a&s;king halfpence from every body that pa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>In ju&s;tice, however, to the memory of Mr. Derrick, who was my fir&s;t tutor in the ways of London, and &s;hewed me the town in its variety of depart|ments, both literary and &s;portive, the particulars of which Dr. John&s;on advi&s;ed me to put in writing, it is proper to mention what John&s;on, at a &s;ub|&s;equent period, &s;aid of him both as a writer and an editor. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I have often &s;aid, that if Derrick's letters had been written by one of a more e&s;tabli&s;hed name, they would have been thought very pretty letters <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 104.</NOTE>."</Q> And, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ent Derrick to Dryden's relations to gather materials for his life; and I believe he got all that I my&s;elf &s;hould have got <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 142.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Poor Derrick! I remember him with kindne&s;s. Yet I cannot with-hold from my readers a plea&s;ant humourous &s;ally which could not have hurt him had he been alive, and now is perfectly harmle&s;s. In his collection of poems, there is one upon entering the harbour of Dublin, his native city, after a long ab&s;ence. It begins thus:
<Q><L>"Eblana! much lov'd city, hail!</L>
<L>"Where fir&s;t I &s;aw the light of day."</L></Q>
<PB N="248" REF="279" MS="y">
 And after a &s;olemn reflection on his being <Q REND="inline">"numbered with forgotten dead,"</Q> there is the following &s;tanza:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Unle&s;s my lines protract my fame,</L>
<L>"And tho&s;e, who chance to read them, cry,</L>
<L>"I knew him! Derrick was his name,</L>
<L>"In yonder tomb his a&s;hes lie."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Which was thus happily parodied by Mr. John Home, to whom we owe the beautiful and pathetick tragedy of <Q REND="inline">"Douglas:"</Q></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Unle&s;s my <HI>deeds</HI> protract my fame,</L>
<L>"And he who pa&s;&s;es &s;adly &s;ings,</L>
<L>"I knew him! Derrick was his name,</L>
<L>"On yonder tree his carca&s;e &s;wings!"</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I doubt much whether the amiable and ingenious authour of the&s;e burle&s;que lines will recollect them, for they were produced extempore one evening while he and I were walking together in the dining-room at Eglintoune ca&s;tle, in 1760, and I have never mentioned them to him &s;ince.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;aid once to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I honour Derrick for his pre&s;ence of mind. One night, when Floyd <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">He publi&s;hed a biographical work, containing an account of eminent writers, in three vols. 8vo.</NOTE>, another poor authour, was wandering about the &s;treets in the night, he found Derrick fa&s;t a&s;leep upon a bulk; upon being &s;uddenly waked, Derrick &s;tarted up, 'My dear Floyd, I am &s;orry to &s;ee you in this de&s;titute &s;tate; will you go home with me to <HI>my lodgings?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>I again begged his advice as to my method of &s;tudy at Utrecht. <Q REND="inline">"Come, (&s;aid he) let us make a day of it. Let us go down to Greenwich and dine, and talk of it there."</Q> The following Saturday was fixed for this excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>As we walked along the Strand to-night, arm in arm, a woman of the town acco&s;ted us, in the u&s;ual enticing manner. <Q REND="inline">"No, no, my girl, (&s;aid John&s;on,) it won't do."</Q> He, however, did not treat her with har&s;hne&s;s, and we talked of the wretched life of &s;uch women; and agreed, that much more mi&s;ery than happine&s;s, upon the whole, is produced by illicit commerce between the &s;exes.</P>
<P>On Saturday, July 30, Dr. John&s;on and I took a &s;culler at the Temple|&s;tairs, and &s;et out for Greenwich. I a&s;ked him if he really thought a know|ledge of the Greek and Latin languages an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to a good education. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t certainly, Sir.

Mr. John&s;on then turning to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he) a de&s;ire of knowledge is the natural feeling of mankind; and every human being, who&s;e mind is not debauched, will be willing to give all that he has to get knowledge."</Q></P>
<P>We landed at the Old Swan, and walked to Billing&s;gate, where we took oars, and moved &s;moothly along the &s;ilver Thames. It was a very fine day. We were entertained with the immen&s;e number and variety of &s;hips that were lying at anchor, and with the beautiful country on each &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>I talked of preaching, and of the great &s;ucce&s;s which tho&s;e called Methodi&s;ts<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">All who are acquainted with the hi&s;tory of Religion, (the mo&s;t important, &s;urely, that con|cerns the human mind,) know that the appellation of <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> was fir&s;t given to a &s;ociety of &s;tudents in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, who about the year 1730, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by an earne&s;t and methodical attention to devout exerci&s;es. This di&s;po&s;ition of mind is not a novelty or peculiar to any &s;ect, but has been, and &s;till may be found, in many Chri&s;tians of every denomi|nation. John&s;on him&s;elf was, in a dignified manner, a Methodi&s;t. In his Rambler, No. 110, he mentions with re&s;pect <Q REND="inline">"the whole di&s;cipline of regulated piety;"</Q> and in his <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> many in&s;tances occur of his anxious examination into his &s;piritual &s;tate. That this religious earne&s;tne&s;s, and in particular an ob&s;ervation of the influence of the Holy Spirit, has &s;ometimes degenerated into folly, and &s;ometimes been counterfeited for ba&s;e purpo&s;es, cannot be denied. But it is not, therefore, fair to decry it when genuine. The principal argument in rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e again&s;t methodi&s;m is&punc; that it tends to deba&s;e human nature, and prevent the generous exertions of goodne&s;s, by an unworthy &s;uppo&s;ition that GOD will pay no regard to them, although it is po&s;itively &s;aid in the &s;criptures that he <Q REND="inline">"will reward every man according to his works."</Q> But I am happy to have it in my power to do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e whom it is the fa&s;hion to ridicule, without any knowledge of their tenets; and this I can do by quoting a pa&s;&s;age from one of their be&s;t apologi&s;ts, Mr. Milner, who thus expre&s;&s;es their doctrine upon this &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;tified by faith, renewed in his faculties, and con&s;trained by the love of Chri&s;t, their believer moves in the &s;phere of love and gratitude, and all his <HI>duties</HI> flow more or le&s;s from this principle. And though <HI>they are accumulating for him in heaven a trea&s;ure of bli&s;s proportioned to his faithfulne&s;s and activity, and it is by no means incon&s;i&s;tent with his principles to feel the force of this con&s;ideration,</HI> yet love it&s;elf &s;weetens every duty to his mind; and he thinks there is no ab&s;urdity in his feeling the love of GOD as the grand commanding principle of his life."</Q> <HI>E&s;&s;ays on &s;everal religious Subjects, &amp;c. by Jo&s;eph Milner, A.

 and familiar manner, which is the only way to do good to the common people, and which clergymen of genius and learning ought to do from a principle of duty, when it is &s;uited to their congregations; a practice, for which they will be prai&s;ed by men of &s;en&s;e. To in&s;i&s;t again&s;t drunkenne&s;s as a crime, becau&s;e it deba&s;es Rea&s;on, the noble&s;t faculty of man, would be of no &s;ervice to the common people: but to tell them that they may die in a fit of drunkenne&s;s, and &s;hew them how dreadful that would be, cannot fail to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion. Sir, when your Scotch clergy give up their homely manner, religion will &s;oon decay in that country."</Q> Let this ob&s;ervation, as John&s;on meant it, be ever remembered.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed to find my&s;elf with John&s;on at Greenwich, which he celebrates in his <Q REND="inline">"London"</Q> as a favourite &s;cene. I had the poem in my pocket, and read the lines aloud with enthu&s;ia&s;m:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"On Thames's banks in &s;ilent thought we &s;tood,</L>
<L>"Where Greenwich &s;miles upon the &s;ilver flood:</L>
<L>"Pleas'd with the &s;eat which gave ELIZA birth,</L>
<L>"We kneel, and ki&s;s the con&s;ecrated earth."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He remarked that the &s;tructure of Greenwich ho&s;pital was too magnificent for a place of charity, and that its parts were too much detached to make one great whole.</P>
<P>Buchanan, he &s;aid, was a very fine poet; and ob&s;erved, that he was the fir&s;t who complimented a lady, by a&s;cribing to her the different perfections of the heathen godde&s;&s;es; but that John&s;ton improved upon this, by making his lady, at the &s;ame time, free from their defects.</P>
<P>He dwelt upon Buchanan's elegant ver&s;es to Mary Queen of Scots, <HI>Nympha Caledoniae,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;poke with enthu&s;ia&s;m of the beauty of Latin ver&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"All the modern languages (&s;aid he) cannot furni&s;h &s;o melodious a line as
<Q><L>'Formo&s;am re&s;onare doces Amarillida &s;ilvas."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Afterwards he entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, which was to give me his advice as to a cour&s;e of &s;tudy. And here I am to mention with much
<PB N="251" REF="282" MS="y">
regret, that my record of what he &s;aid is mi&s;erably &s;canty. I recollect with admiration an animating blaze of eloquence, which rou&s;ed every intellectual power in me to the highe&s;t pitch, but mu&s;t have dazzled me &s;o much, that my memory could not pre&s;erve the &s;ub&s;tance of his di&s;cour&s;e; for the note which I find of it is no more than this:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He ran over the grand &s;cale of human knowledge; advi&s;ed me to &s;elect &s;ome particular branch to excel in, but to acquire a little of every kind."</Q> The defect of my minutes will be fully &s;upplied by a long letter upon the &s;ubject which he favoured me with, after I had been &s;ome time at Utrecht, and which my readers will have the plea&s;ure to peru&s;e in its proper place.</P>
<P>We walked in the evening in Greenwich Park. He a&s;ked me, I &s;uppo&s;e by way of trying my di&s;po&s;ition, <Q REND="inline">"Is not this very fine?"</Q> Having no exqui|&s;ite reli&s;h of the beauties of Nature, and being more delighted with <Q REND="inline">"the bu&s;y hum of men,"</Q> I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but not equal to Fleet-&s;treet."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are right, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>I am aware that many of my readers may cen&s;ure my want of ta&s;te. Let me, however, &s;helter my&s;elf under the authority of a very fa&s;hionable Baronet in the brilliant world, who, on his attention being called to the fragrance of a May evening in the country, ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"This may be very well; but, for my part, I prefer the &s;mell of a flambeau at the play-hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;taid &s;o long at Greenwich, that our &s;ail up the river, in our return to London, was by no means &s;o plea&s;ant as in the morning; for the night air was &s;o cold that it made me &s;hiver. I was the more &s;en&s;ible of it from having &s;at up all the night before, recollecting and writing in my journal what I thought worthy of pre&s;ervation; an exertion, which, during the fir&s;t part of my acquaintance with John&s;on, I frequently made. I remember having &s;at up four nights in one week, without being much incommoded in the day time.</P>
<P>John&s;on, who&s;e robu&s;t frame was not in the lea&s;t affected by the cold, &s;colded me, as if my &s;hivering had been a paltry effeminacy, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Why do you &s;hiver?"</Q> Sir William Scott, of the Commons, told me, that when he complained of a head-ach in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, as they were travelling toge|ther to Scotland, John&s;on treated him in the &s;ame manner: <Q REND="inline">"At your age, Sir, I had no head-ach."</Q> It is not ea&s;y to make allowance for &s;en&s;ations in others, which we our&s;elves have not at the time. We mu&s;t all have experienced how very differently we are affected by the complaints of our neighbours, when we are well and when we are ill. In full health, we can &s;carcely believe that they &s;uffer much; &s;o faint is the image of pain upon our imagination: when &s;oftened by &s;ickne&s;s, we readily &s;ympathize with the &s;ufferings of others.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="283" MS="y">
 We concluded the day at the Turk's Head coffee-hou&s;e very &s;ocially. He was plea&s;ed to li&s;ten to a particular account which I gave him of my family, and of its hereditary e&s;tate, as to the extent and population of which he a&s;ked que&s;tions, and made calculations; recommending, at the &s;ame time, a liberal kindne&s;s to the tenantry, as people over whom the proprietor was placed by Providence. He took delight in hearing my de&s;cription of the romantick &s;eat of my ance&s;tors. <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t be there, Sir, (&s;aid he) and we will live in the old ca&s;tle; and if there is not a room in it remaining, we will build one."</Q> I was highly flattered, but could &s;carcely indulge a hope that Auchinleck would indeed be honoured by his pre&s;ence, and celebrated by a de&s;cription, as it afterwards was, in his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands."</Q></P>
<P>After we had again talked of my &s;etting out for Holland, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t &s;ee thee out of England: I will accompany you to Harwich."</Q> I could not find words to expre&s;s what I felt upon this unexpected and very great mark of his affectionate regard.</P>
<P>Next day, Sunday, July 31, I told him I had been that morning at a meeting of the people called Quakers, where I had heard a woman preach. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are &s;urprized to find it done at all."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, Augu&s;t 2, (the day of my departure from London having been fixed for the 5th,) Dr. John&s;on did me the honour to pa&s;s a part of the morning with me at my Chambers. He &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"he always felt an incli|nation to do nothing."</Q> I ob&s;erved, that it was &s;trange to think that the mo&s;t indolent man in Britain had written the mo&s;t laborious work, THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY.</P>
<P>I mentioned an imprudent publication, by a certain friend of his, at an early period of life, and a&s;ked him if he thought it would hurt him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; not much. It may, perhaps, be mentioned at an election."</Q></P>
<P>I had now made good my title to be a privileged man, and was carried by him in the evening to drink tea with Mi&s;s Williams, whom, though under the misfortune of having lo&s;t her &s;ight, I found to be agreeable in conver|&s;ation; for &s;he had a variety of literature, and expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf well; but her peculiar value was the intimacy in which &s;he had long lived with John&s;on, by which &s;he was well acquainted with his habits, and knew how to lead him on to talk.</P>
<P>After tea he carried me to what he called his walk, which was a long narrow paved court in the neighbourhood, over&s;hadowed by &s;ome trees. There we &s;auntered a con&s;iderable time; and I complained to him that my love of
<PB N="253" REF="284" MS="y">
London and of his company was &s;uch, that I &s;hrunk almo&s;t from the thought of going away even to travel, which is generally &s;o much de&s;ired by young men. He rou&s;ed me by manly and &s;pirited conver&s;ation. He advi&s;ed me, when &s;ettled in any place abroad, to &s;tudy with an eagerne&s;s after know|ledge, and to apply to Greek an hour every day; and when I was moving about, to read diligently the great book of mankind.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, Augu&s;t 3, we had our la&s;t &s;ocial evening at the Turk's Head coffee-hou&s;e, before my &s;etting out for foreign parts. I had the mi&s;|fortune, before we parted, to irritate him unintentionally. I mentioned to him how common it was in the world to tell ab&s;urd &s;tories of him, and to a&s;cribe to him very &s;trange &s;ayings. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What do they make me &s;ay, Sir?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as an in&s;tance very &s;trange indeed, (laugh|ing heartily as I &s;poke,) David Hume told me, you &s;aid that you would &s;tand before a battery of cannon, to re&s;tore the Convocation to its full powers."</Q>&mdash;Little did I apprehend that he had actually &s;aid this; but I was &s;oon convinced of my errour; for, with a determined look, he thundered out, <Q REND="inline">"And would I not, Sir? Shall the Pre&s;byterian <HI>Kirk</HI> of Scotland have its General A&s;&s;em|bly, and the Church of England be denied its Convocation?"</Q> He was walking up and down the room while I told him the anecdote; but when he uttered this explo&s;ion of high-church zeal, he had come clo&s;e to my chair, and his eyes fla&s;hed with indignation. I bowed to the &s;torm, and diverted the force of it, by leading him to expatiate on the influence which religion derived from maintaining the church with great external re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention that he this year wrote <Q REND="inline">"The Life of A&s;cham, &dagger;"</Q> and the Dedication to the Earl of Shafte&s;bury, &dagger; prefixed to the edition of that writer's Engli&s;h works, publi&s;hed by Mr. Bennet.</P>
<P>On Friday, Augu&s;t 5, we &s;et out early in the morning in the Harwich &s;tage coach. A fat elderly gentlewoman, and a young Dutchman, &s;eemed the mo&s;t inclined among us to conver&s;ation. At the inn where we dined, the gentle|woman &s;aid that &s;he had done her be&s;t to educate her children; and, particu|larly, that &s;he had never &s;uffered them to be a moment idle. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h, Madam, you would educate me too; for I have been an idle fellow all my life."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) you have not been idle."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Madam, it is very true; and that gentleman there (pointing to me,) has been idle. He was idle at Edinburgh. His father &s;ent him to Gla&s;gow, where he continued to be idle. He then came to London, where he has been very idle; and now he is going to Utrecht, where he will be as idle as
<PB N="254" REF="285" MS="y">
 ever."</Q> I a&s;ked him privately how he could expo&s;e me &s;o. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Poh, poh! (&s;aid he) they knew nothing about you, and will think of it no more."</Q> In the afternoon the gentlewoman talked violently again&s;t the Roman Catho|licks, and of the horrours of the Inqui&s;ition. To the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of all the pa&s;&s;engers but my&s;elf, who knew that he could talk upon any &s;ide of a que&s;tion, he defended the Inqui&s;ition, and maintained, that <Q REND="inline">"fal&s;e doctrine &s;hould be checked on its fir&s;t appearance; that the civil power &s;hould unite with the church in puni&s;hing tho&s;e who dared to attack the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and that &s;uch only were puni&s;hed by the Inqui&s;ition."</Q> He had in his pocket <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Pomponius Mela de &s;itu Orbis,"</HI></Q> in which he read occa&s;ionally, and &s;eemed very intent upon ancient geography. Though by no means niggardly, his attention to what was generally right was &s;o minute, that having ob&s;erved at one of the &s;tages that I o&s;tentatiou&s;ly gave a &s;hilling to the coachman, when the cu&s;tom was for each pa&s;&s;enger to give only &s;ix-pence, he took me a&s;ide and &s;colded me, &s;aying that what I had done would make the coachman di&s;&s;atisfied with all the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers, who gave him no more than his due. This was a ju&s;t reprimand; for in whatever way a man may indulge his genero&s;ity or his vanity in &s;pending his money, for the &s;ake of others he ought not to rai&s;e the price of any article for which there is a con&s;tant demand.</P>
<P>He talked of Mr. Blacklock's poetry, &s;o far as it was de&s;criptive of vi&s;ible objects; and ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"as its authour had the misfortune to be blind, we may be ab&s;olutely &s;ure that &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages are combinations of what he has remembered of the works of other writers who could &s;ee. That fooli&s;h fellow Spence has laboured to explain philo&s;ophically how Blacklock may have done, by means of his own faculties, what it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould do. The &s;olution, as I have given it, is plain. Suppo&s;e, I know a man to be &s;o lame that he is ab&s;olutely incapable to move him&s;elf, and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him; &s;hall I puzzle my&s;elf with idle conjectures, that, perhaps, his nerves have by &s;ome unknown change all at once become effective? No, Sir; it is clear how he got into a different room. He was <HI>carried."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having &s;topped a night at Colche&s;ter, John&s;on talked of that town with veneration, for having &s;tood a &s;iege for Charles the Fir&s;t. The Dutch|man alone now remained with us. He &s;poke Engli&s;h tolerably well; and thinking to recommend him&s;elf to us by expatiating on the &s;uperiority of the criminal juri&s;prudence of this country over that of Holland, he inveighed again&s;t the barbarity of putting an accu&s;ed per&s;on to the torture, in order to force a confe&s;&s;ion. But John&s;on was as ready for this, as for the Inqui&s;ition.
<PB N="255" REF="286" MS="y">
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you do not, I find, under&s;tand the law of your own country. The torture in Holland is con&s;idered as a favour to an accu&s;ed per&s;on; for no man is put to the torture there, unle&s;s there is as much evidence again&s;t him as would amount to conviction in England. An accu&s;ed per&s;on among you, therefore, has one chance more to e&s;cape puni&s;hment, than tho&s;e who are tried among us."</Q></P>
<P>At &s;upper this night he talked of good eating with uncommon &s;atisfaction. <Q REND="inline">"Some people (&s;aid he,) have a fooli&s;h way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very &s;tudiou&s;ly, and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind any thing el&s;e."</Q> He now appeared to me <HI>Jean Bull philo&s;ophe,</HI> and he was, for the moment, not only &s;erious but vehement. Yet I have heard him, upon other occa&s;ions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206th number of his Rambler is a ma&s;terly e&s;&s;ay again&s;t gulo&s;ity. His practice, indeed, I mu&s;t acknowledge, may be con|&s;idered as ca&s;ting the balance of his different opinions upon this &s;ubject; for I never knew any man who reli&s;hed good eating more than he did. When at table, he was totally ab&s;orbed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the moment; his looks &s;eemed rivetted to his plate; nor would he, unle&s;s when in very high company, &s;ay one word, or even pay the lea&s;t attention to what was &s;aid by others, till he had &s;atisfied his appetite, which was &s;o fierce, and indulged with &s;uch inten&s;e|ne&s;s, that while in the act of eating, the veins of his forehead &s;welled, and generally a &s;trong per&s;piration was vi&s;ible. To tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;ations were delicate, this could not but be di&s;gu&s;ting; and it was doubtle&s;s not very &s;uit|able to the character of a philo&s;opher, who &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;elf|command. But it mu&s;t be owned, that John&s;on, though he could be rigidly <HI>ab&s;temious,</HI> was not a <HI>temperate</HI> man either in eating or drinking. He could refrain, but he could not u&s;e moderately. He told me, that he had fa&s;ted two days without inconvenience, and that he had never been hungry but once. They who beheld with wonder how much he eat upon all occa&s;ions when his dinner was to his ta&s;te, could not ea&s;ily conceive what he mu&s;t have meant by hunger; and not only was he remarkable for the extraordinary quantity which he eat, but he was, or affected to be, a man of very nice di&s;cernment in the &s;cience of cookery. He u&s;ed to de&s;cant critically on the di&s;hes which had been at table where he had dined or &s;upped, and to recollect very minutely what he had liked. I remember, when he was in Scotland, his prai&s;ing <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Gordon's palates,"</HI></Q> (a di&s;h of palates at the Honourable Alexander Gordon's,) with a warmth of expre&s;&s;ion which might have done honour to more important
<PB N="256" REF="287" MS="y">
 &s;ubjects. <Q REND="inline">"As for&mdash;'s imitation of a <HI>made di&s;h</HI> it was a wretched attempt."</Q> He about the &s;ame time was &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed with the performances of a nobleman's French cook, that he exclaimed with vehemence, <Q REND="inline">"I'd throw &s;uch a ra&s;cal into the river;"</Q> and he then proceeded to alarm a lady at who&s;e hou&s;e he was to &s;up, by the following manife&s;to of his &s;kill: <Q REND="inline">"I, Madam, who live at a variety of good tables, am a much better judge of cookery, than any per&s;on who has a very tolerable cook, but lives much at home; for his palate is gradually adapted to the ta&s;te of his cook; whereas, Madam, in trying by a wider range, I can more exqui&s;itely judge."</Q> When invited to dine, even with an intimate friend, he was not plea&s;ed if &s;omething better than a plain dinner was not prepared for him. I have heard him &s;ay on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"This was a good dinner enough, to be &s;ure; but it was not a dinner to <HI>a&s;k</HI> a man to."</Q> On the other hand, he was wont to expre&s;s, with great glee, his &s;ati&s;|faction when he had been entertained quite to his mind. One day when he had dined with his neighbour and landlord in Bolt-court, Mr. Allen, the printer, who&s;e old hou&s;ekeeper had &s;tudied his ta&s;te in every thing, he pro|nounced this eulogy, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we could not have had a better dinner had there been a <HI>Synod of Cooks."</HI></Q></P>
<P>While we were left by our&s;elves, after the Dutchman had gone to bed, Dr. John&s;on talked of that &s;tudied behaviour which many have recommended and practi&s;ed. He di&s;approved of it; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I never con&s;idered whether I &s;hould be a grave man, or a merry man, but ju&s;t let inclination, for the time, have its cour&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>He flattered me with &s;ome hopes that he would, in the cour&s;e of the follow|ing &s;ummer, come over to Holland, and accompany me in a tour through the Netherlands.</P>
<P>I teized him with fanciful apprehen&s;ions of unhappine&s;s. A moth having fluttered round the candle, and burnt it&s;elf, he laid hold of this little inci|dent to admoni&s;h me; &s;aying, with a &s;ly look, and in a &s;olemn but quiet tone, <Q REND="inline">"That creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was BOSWELL."</Q></P>
<P>Next day we got to Harwich to dinner; and my pa&s;&s;age in the packet|boat to Helvoet&s;luys being &s;ecured, and my baggage put on board, we dined at our inn by our&s;elves.

<PB N="257" REF="288" MS="y">
tude, is, no doubt, too frequent every where; but, I think, mo&s;t remarkable  among the French, of which, all who have travelled in France mu&s;t have been &s;truck with innumerable in&s;tances.</P>
<P>We went and looked at the church, and having gone into it and walked up to the altar, John&s;on, who&s;e piety was con&s;tant and fervent, &s;ent me to my knees, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Now that you are going to leave your native country, recom|mend your&s;elf to the protection of your Creator and Redeemer."</Q></P>
<P>After we came out of the church, we &s;tood talking for &s;ome time together of Bi&s;hop Berkeley's ingenious &s;ophi&s;try to prove the non-exi&s;tence of matter, and that every thing in the univer&s;e is merely ideal. I ob&s;erved, that though we are &s;atisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impo&s;&s;ible to refute it.

To me it is not conceivable how Berkeley can be an&s;wered by pure rea&s;oning. But I know that the nice and difficult ta&s;k was to have been under|taken by one of the mo&s;t luminous minds of the pre&s;ent age; had not politicks <Q REND="inline">"turned him from calm philo&s;ophy a&s;ide."</Q> What an admirable di&s;play of &s;ubtilty, united with brilliance, might his contending with Berkeley have afforded us!

<P>My revered friend walked down with me to the beach, where we embraced and parted with tenderne&s;s, and engaged to corre&s;pond by letters.

<P>Utrecht &s;eeming at fir&s;t very dull to me, after the animated &s;cenes of London, my &s;pirits were grievou&s;ly affected; and I wrote to John&s;on a plaintive and de&s;ponding letter, to which he paid no regard.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A Mr. Mr. <HI>BOSWELL,</HI> &agrave; la Cour de l'Empereur, Utrecht.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are not to think your&s;elf forgotten, or criminally neglected, that you have had yet no letter from me. I love to &s;ee my friends, to hear from them, to talk to them, and to talk of them; but it is not without a con&s;iderable effort of re&s;olution that I prevail upon my&s;elf to write. I would not, however, gratify my own indolence by the omi&s;&s;ion of any important duty, or any office of real kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>To tell you that I am or am not well, that I have or have not been in the country, that I drank your health in the room in which we &s;at la&s;t together, and that your acquaintance continue to &s;peak of you with their former kind|ne&s;s, topicks with which tho&s;e letters are commonly filled which are written only for the &s;ake of writing, I &s;eldom &s;hall think worth communicating; but if I can have it in my power to calm any harra&s;&s;ing di&s;quiet, to excite any virtuous de&s;ire, to rectify any important opinion, or fortify any generous re&s;o|lution, you need not doubt but I &s;hall at lea&s;t wi&s;h to prefer the plea&s;ure of gratifying a friend much le&s;s e&s;teemed than your&s;elf, before the gloomy calm of idle vacancy. Whether I &s;hall ea&s;ily arrive at an exact punctuality of corre&s;pondence, I cannot tell. I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent, expect that you will receive this in return for two which I have had from you. The fir&s;t, indeed, gave me an account &s;o hopele&s;s of the &s;tate of your mind, that it hardly admitted or de&s;erved an an&s;wer; by the &s;econd I was much better plea&s;ed: and the plea&s;ure will &s;till be increa&s;ed by &s;uch a narrative of the progre&s;s of your &s;tudies, as may evince the continuance of an equal and rational application of your mind to &s;ome u&s;eful enquiry.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, wi&s;h to a&s;k, what &s;tudy I would recommend. I &s;hall not &s;peak of theology, becau&s;e it ought not to be con&s;idered as a que&s;tion whether you &s;hall endeavour to know the will of GOD.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, con&s;ider only &s;uch &s;tudies as we are at liberty to pur&s;ue or to neglect; and of the&s;e I know not how you will make a better choice, than by &s;tudying the civil law, as your father advi&s;es, and the ancient languages, as you had determined for your&s;elf; at lea&s;t re&s;olve, while you remain in any
<PB N="259" REF="290">
&s;ettled re&s;idence, to &s;pend a certain number of hours every day among&s;t your books. The di&s;&s;ipation of thought, of which you complain, is nothing more than the vacillation of a mind &s;u&s;pended between different motives, and changing its direction as any motive gains or lo&s;es &s;trength. If you can but kindle in your mind any &s;trong de&s;ire, if you can but keep predominant any wi&s;h for &s;ome particular excellence or attainment, the gu&s;ts of imagination will break away, without any effect upon your conduct, and commonly without any traces left upon the memory.</P>
<P>There lurks, perhaps, in every human heart a de&s;ire of di&s;tinction, which inclines every man fir&s;t to hope, and then to believe, that Nature has given him &s;omething peculiar to him&s;elf. This vanity makes one mind nur&s;e aver&s;ions, and another actuate de&s;ires, till they ri&s;e by art much above their original &s;tate of power; and as affectation, in time, improves to habit, they at la&s;t tyranni&s;e over him who at fir&s;t encouraged them only for &s;how. Every de&s;ire is a viper in the bo&s;om, who, while he was chill, was harmle&s;s; but when warmth gave him &s;trength, exerted it in poi&s;on. You know a gentle|man, who, when fir&s;t he &s;et his foot in the gay world, as he prepared him&s;elf to whirl in the vortex of plea&s;ure, imagined a total indifference and univer&s;al negligence to be the mo&s;t agreeable concomitants of youth, and the &s;tronge&s;t indication of an airy temper and a quick apprehen&s;ion. Vacant to every object, and &s;en&s;ible of every impul&s;e, he thought that all appearance of dili|gence would deduct &s;omething from the reputation of genius; and hoped that he &s;hould appear to attain, amid&s;t all the ea&s;e of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and all the tumult of diver&s;ion, that knowledge and tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which mortals of the common fabrick obtain only by mute ab&s;traction and &s;olitary drudgery. He tried this &s;cheme of life awhile, was made weary of it by his &s;en&s;e and his virtue, he then wi&s;hed to return to his &s;tudies; and finding long habits of idle|ne&s;s and plea&s;ure harder to be cured than he expected, &s;till willing to retain his claim to &s;ome extraordinary prerogatives, re&s;olved the common con&s;e|quences of irregularity into an unalterable decree of de&s;tiny, and concluded that Nature had originally formed him incapable of rational employment.</P>
<P>Let all &s;uch fancies, illu&s;ive and de&s;tructive, be bani&s;hed henceforward from your thoughts for ever. Re&s;olve, and keep your re&s;olution; choo&s;e, and pur&s;ue your choice. If you &s;pend this day in &s;tudy, you will find your|&s;elf &s;till more able to &s;tudy to-morrow; not that you are to expect that you &s;hall at once obtain a complete victory. Depravity is not very ea&s;ily over|come. Re&s;olution will &s;ometimes relax, and diligence will &s;ometimes be interrupted; but let no accidental &s;urprize or deviation, whether &s;hort or long,
<PB N="260" REF="291">
 di&s;po&s;e you to de&s;pondency. Con&s;ider the&s;e failings as incident to all man|kind. Begin again where you left off, and endeavour to avoid the &s;educements that prevailed over you before.</P>
<P>This, my dear Bo&s;well, is advice which, perhaps, has been often given you, and given you without effect. But this advice, if you will not take from others, you mu&s;t take from your own reflections, if you purpo&s;e to do the duties of the &s;tation to which the bounty of Providence has called you.</P>
<P>Let me have a long letter from you as &s;oon as you can. I hope you continue your journal, and enrich it with many ob&s;ervations upon the country in which you re&s;ide. It will be a favour if you can get me any books in the Fri&s;ick language, and can enquire how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that neither in my own minutes, nor in my letters to John&s;on which have been pre&s;erved by him, can I find any information how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces. But I &s;hall extract from one of my letters what I learnt concerning the other &s;ubject of his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have made all po&s;&s;ible enquiry with re&s;pect to the Fri&s;ick language, and find that it has been le&s;s cultivated than any other of the northern dialects; a certain proof of which is their deficiency of books. Of the old Fri&s;ick there are no remains, except &s;ome ancient laws pre&s;erved by <HI>Schotanus</HI> in his <HI>'Be&s;chryvinge van die Heerlykheid van Frie&s;land;'</HI> and his <HI>'Hi&s;toria Fri&s;ica.'</HI> I have not yet been able to find the&s;e books. Profe&s;&s;or Trotz, who formerly was of the Univer&s;ity of Vranyken, in Frie&s;land, and is at pre&s;ent preparing an edition of all the Fri&s;ick laws, gave me this information.

<P><MILESTONE N="1764"> Early in 1764 John&s;on paid a vi&s;it to the Langton family, at their &s;eat of Langton, in Lincoln&s;hire, where he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, much to his &s;atisfac|tion. His friend Bennet Langton, it will not be doubted, did every thing in his power to make the place agreeable to &s;o illu&s;trious a gue&s;t; and the elder
<PB N="261" REF="292">
Mr. Langton and his lady, being fully capable of under&s;tanding his value, <MILESTONE N="1764. Aetat. 55."> were not wanting in attention. He, however, told me, that old Mr. Langton, though a man of con&s;iderable learning, had &s;o little allowance to make for his occa&s;ional <Q REND="inline">"laxity of talk,"</Q> that becau&s;e in the cour&s;e of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion he &s;ome|times mentioned what might be &s;aid in favour of the peculiar tenets of the Romi&s;h church, he went to his grave believing him to be of that com|munion.</P>
<P>John&s;on, during his &s;tay at Langton, had the advantage of a good library, and &s;aw &s;everal gentlemen of the neighbourhood. I have obtained from Mr. Langton the following particulars of this period.</P>
<P>He was now fully convinced that he could not have been &s;atisfied with a country living; for, talking of a re&s;pectable clergyman in Lincoln&s;hire, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"This man, Sir, fills up the duties of his life well. I approve of him, but could not imitate him."</Q></P>
<P>To a lady who endeavoured to vindicate her&s;elf from blame for neglecting &s;ocial attention to worthy neighbours, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I would go to them if it would do them any good;"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What good, Madam, do you expect to have in your power to do them? It is &s;hewing them re&s;pect, and that is doing them good."</Q></P>
<P>So &s;ocially accommodating was he, that once when Mr. Langton and he were driving together in a coach, and Mr. Langton complained of being &s;ick, he in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould go out, and &s;it on the back of it in the open air, which they did. And being &s;en&s;ible how &s;trange the appearance mu&s;t be, ob&s;erved, that a countryman whom they &s;aw in a field would probably be thinking, <Q REND="inline">"If the&s;e two madmen &s;hould come down, what would become of me?"</Q></P>
<P>Soon after his return to London, which was in February, was founded that club which exi&s;ted long without a name, but at Mr. Garrick's funeral became di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of THE LITERARY CLUB. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds had the merit of being the fir&s;t propo&s;er of it, to which John&s;on acceded, and the original members were, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Dr. John&s;on, Mr. Edmund Burke, Dr. Nugent, Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Mr. Chamier, and Sir John Hawkins. They met at the Turk's Head, in Gerard|&s;treet, Soho, one evening in every week, at &s;even, and generally continued their conver&s;ation till a pretty late hour. This club has been gradually increa&s;ed, and in&s;tead of a&s;&s;embling in the evening, they now dine together at a tavern in Dover|&s;treet, once a fortnight, during the meeting of Parliament. Between the time of its formation, and the time at which this work is pa&s;&s;ing through the
<PB N="262" REF="293" MS="y">
 pre&s;s, (1790,) the following per&s;ons, now dead, were members of it: Mr. Dunning, (afterwards Lord A&s;hburton,) Mr. Dyer, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Shipley Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Mr. Ve&s;ey, and Mr. Thomas Warton. The pre&s;ent members are, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Burke, Mr. Langton, Dr. Percy Bi&s;hop of Dromore, Dr. Barnard Bi&s;hop of Killaloe, Dr. Marlay Bi&s;hop of Clonfert, Mr. Fox, Dr. George Fordyce, Sir William Scott, Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, Sir Charles Bunbury, Mr. Windham of Norfolk, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Gibbon, Dr. Adam Smith, Lord Charlemont, Sir Robert Chambers, Sir William Jones, Mr. Colman, Mr. Steevens, Dr. Burney, Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, Mr. Malone, Lord O&s;&s;ory, Lord Spencer, Lord Lucan, Lord Palmer&s;ton, Lord Elliot, Lord Macartney, Mr. Richard Burke, junior, Sir William Hamilton, Dr. Warren, Mr. Courtenay, and the writer of this account.</P>
<P>Sir John Hawkins<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Life of John&s;on, p. 425.</NOTE> repre&s;ents him&s;elf as a <Q REND="inline"><HI>"&s;eceder"</HI></Q> from this &s;ociety, and a&s;&s;igns as the rea&s;on of his <Q REND="inline"><HI>"withdrawing"</HI></Q> him&s;elf from it, that its late hours were incon&s;i&s;tent with his dome&s;tick arrangements. In this he is not accurate; for the fact was, that he one evening attacked Mr. Burke in &s;o rude a manner, that all the company te&s;tified their di&s;plea&s;ure; and at their next meeting his reception was &s;uch, that he never came again <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">From Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He is equally inaccurate with re&s;pect to Mr. Garrick, of whom he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"he tru&s;ted that the lea&s;t intimation of a de&s;ire to come among us, would procure him a ready admi&s;&s;ion; but in this he was mi&s;taken. John&s;on con|&s;ulted me upon it; and when I could find no objection to receiving him, exclaimed,&mdash;'He will di&s;turb us by his buffoonery;'&mdash;and afterwards &s;o managed matters, that he was never formally propo&s;ed, and, by con&s;equence, never admitted <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Life of John&s;on, p. 425.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>In ju&s;tice both to Mr. Garrick and Dr. John&s;on, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to rectify this mi&s;-&s;tatement. The truth is, that not very long after the in&s;ti|tution of our club, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds was &s;peaking of it to Garrick. <Q REND="inline">"I like it much, (&s;aid he,) I think I &s;hall be of you."</Q> When Sir Jo&s;hua men|tioned this to Dr. John&s;on, he was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the actor's conceit. <Q REND="inline"><HI>"He'll be of us,</HI> (&s;aid John&s;on,) how does he know we will <HI>permit</HI> him? The fir&s;t duke in England has no right to hold &s;uch language."</Q> However, when Garrick was regularly propo&s;ed &s;ome time afterwards, John&s;on, though he had taken a momentary offence at his arrogance, warmly and kindly &s;upported him, and he was accordingly elected, was a mo&s;t agreeable member, and continued to attend our meetings to the time of his death.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="294" MS="y">
Mrs. Piozzi<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from Dr. John&s;on. Vol. II. p. 278.</NOTE> has al&s;o given a &s;imilar mi&s;repre&s;entation of John&s;on's treat|ment of Garrick in this particular, as if he had u&s;ed the&s;e contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions: <Q REND="inline">"If Garrick <HI>does</HI> apply, I'll black-ball him.&mdash;Surely, one ought to &s;it in a &s;ociety like ours,
<Q><L>'Unelbow'd by a game&s;ter, pimp, or player."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>I am happy to be enabled by &s;uch unque&s;tionable authority as that of Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, as well as from my own knowledge, to vindicate at once the heart of John&s;on and the &s;ocial merit of Garrick.</P>
<P>In this year, except what he may have done in revi&s;ing Shak&s;peare, we do not find that he laboured much in literature. He wrote a review of Grainger's <Q REND="inline">"Sugar Cane, a Poem,"</Q> in the London Chronicle. He told me, that Dr. Percy wrote the greate&s;t part of this review; but, I imagine, he did not recollect it di&s;tinctly, for it appears to be mo&s;tly, if not altogether, his own. He al&s;o wrote in the Critical Review, an account&dagger; of Gold&s;mith's excellent poem, <Q REND="inline">"The Traveller."</Q></P>
<P>The ea&s;e and independence to which he had at la&s;t attained by royal muni|ficence, increa&s;ed his natural indolence. In his <Q REND="inline">"Meditations"</Q> he thus accu&s;es him&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">"GOOD FRIDAY, April 20, 1764. I have made no reforma|tion; I have lived totally u&s;ele&s;s, more &s;en&s;ual in thought, and more addicted to wine and meat <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 50.</NOTE>."</Q> And next morning he thus feelingly complains: <Q REND="inline">"My indolence, &s;ince my la&s;t reception of the &s;acrament, has &s;unk into gro&s;&s;er &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, and my di&s;&s;ipation &s;pread into wilder negligence. My thoughts have been clouded with &s;en&s;uality; and, except that from the beginning of this year I have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forborne exce&s;s of &s;trong drink, my appetites have predominated over my rea&s;on. A kind of &s;trange oblivion has over|&s;pread me, &s;o that I know not what has become of the la&s;t year; and perceive that incidents and intelligence pa&s;s over me, without leaving any impre&s;&s;ion."</Q> He then &s;olemnly &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"This is not the life to which heaven is promi&s;ed <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 51.</NOTE>;"</Q> and he earne&s;tly re&s;olves on amendment.</P>
<P>It was his cu&s;tom to ob&s;erve certain days with a pious ab&s;traction; viz. New-year's-day, the day of his wi&s;e's death, Good Friday, Ea&s;ter-day, and his own birth-day. He this year &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I have now &s;pent fifty-five years in re&s;olving; having, from the earlie&s;t time almo&s;t that I can remember, been forming &s;chemes of a better life. I have done nothing. The need of doing, therefore, is pre&s;&s;ing, &s;ince the time of doing is &s;hort. O GOD, grant me to

 re&s;olve aright, and to keep my re&s;olutions, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake. Amen <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 58.</NOTE>."</Q> Such a tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, &s;uch a fervent de&s;ire of improvement, will rarely be found. It is, &s;urely, not decent in tho&s;e who are hardened in indif|ference to &s;piritual improvement, to treat this pious anxiety of John&s;on with contempt.</P>
<P>About this time he was afflicted with a very &s;evere return of the hypochon|driack di&s;order, which was ever lurking about him. He was &s;o ill, as, not|with&s;tanding his remarkable love of company, to be entirely aver&s;e to &s;ociety, the mo&s;t fatal &s;ymptom of that malady. Dr. Adams told me, that, as an old friend, he was admitted to vi&s;it him, and that he found him in a deplorable &s;tate, &s;ighing, groaning, talking to him&s;elf, and re&s;tle&s;sly walking from room to room. He then u&s;ed this emphatical expre&s;&s;ion of the mi&s;ery which he felt: <Q REND="inline">"I would con&s;ent to have a limb amputated to recover my &s;pirits."</Q></P>
<P>Talking to him&s;elf was, indeed, one of his &s;ingularities ever &s;ince I knew him. I was certain that he was frequently uttering pious ejaculations, for fragments of the Lord's Prayer have been di&s;tinctly overheard. His friend Mr. Thomas Davies, of whom Churchill &s;ays,
<Q><L>"That Davies hath a very pretty wife:"</L></Q>
when Dr. John&s;on muttered <Q REND="inline">"lead us not into temptation,"</Q> u&s;ed with wag|gi&s;h and gallant humour to whi&s;per Mrs. Davies, <Q REND="inline">"You, my dear, are the cau&s;e of this."</Q></P>
<P>He had another particularity, of which none of his friends ever ventured to a&s;k an explanation. It appeared to me &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious habit, which he had contracted early, and from which he had never called upon his rea&s;on to di&s;-entangle him. This was his anxious care to go out or in at a door or pa&s;&s;age, by a certain number of &s;teps from a certain point, or at lea&s;t &s;o as that either his right or his left foot, (I am not certain which,) &s;hould con&s;tantly make the fir&s;t actual movement when he came clo&s;e to the door or pa&s;&s;age. Thus I conjecture: for I have, upon innumerable occa&s;ions, ob&s;erved him &s;uddenly &s;top, and then &s;eem to count his &s;teps with a deep earne&s;tne&s;s; and when he had neglected or gone wrong in this &s;ort of magical movement, I have &s;een him go back again, put him&s;elf in a proper po&s;ture to begin the ceremony, and, having gone through it, break from his ab&s;trac|tion, walk bri&s;kly on, and join his companion. A &s;trange in&s;tance of &s;ome|thing of this nature, even when on hor&s;eback, happened when he was in the

<P>That the mo&s;t minute &s;ingularities which belonged to him, and made very ob&s;ervable parts of his appearance and manner, may not be omitted, it is requi&s;ite to mention, that while talking or even mu&s;ing as he &s;at in his chair, he commonly &s;hook his head in a tremulous manner, moving his body back|wards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the &s;ame direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various &s;ounds with his mouth, &s;ometimes as if ruminating, or what is called chewing the cud, &s;ometimes giving a half whi&s;tle, &s;ometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and &s;ometimes pro|truding it again&s;t his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, <HI>too, too, too:</HI> all this accompanied &s;ometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>I am fully aware how very obvious an occa&s;ion I here give for the &s;neer|ing jocularity of &s;uch as have no reli&s;h of an exact likene&s;s; which, to render complete, he who draws it mu&s;t not di&s;dain the &s;lighte&s;t &s;trokes. But if witlings &s;hould be inclined to attack this account, let them have the candour to quote what I have offered in my defence.</P>
<P>He was for &s;ome time in the &s;ummer at Ea&s;ton Maudit, Northampton&s;hire, on a vi&s;it to the Reverend Dr. Percy, now Bi&s;hop of Dromore. Whatever di&s;&s;atisfaction he felt at what he con&s;idered as a &s;low progre&s;s in intellectual improvement, we find that his heart was tender, and his affections warm, as appears from the following very kind letter:

<P><MILESTONE N="1765"> Early in the year 1765 he paid a &s;hort vi&s;it to the Univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge, with his friend Mr. Beauclerk. There is a lively picture&s;que account of his behaviour on this vi&s;it, in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1785, being an extract of a letter from the late Dr. John Sharp. The two following &s;entences are very characteri&s;tical: <Q REND="inline">"He drank his large potations of tea with me, interrupted by many an indignant contradiction, and many a noble &s;enti|ment."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Several per&s;ons got into his company the la&s;t evening at Trinity, where, about twelve, he began to be very great; &s;tripped poor Mrs. Macaulay to the very &s;kin, then gave her for his toa&s;t, and drank her in two bumpers."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;trictne&s;s of his &s;elf-examination and &s;crupulous Chri&s;tian humility, appear in his pious meditation on Ea&s;ter-day this year.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I purpo&s;e again to partake of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament; yet when I con&s;ider how vainly I have hitherto re&s;olved at this annual commemoration of my Saviour's death, to regulate my life by his laws, I am almo&s;t afraid to renew my re&s;olutions <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 61.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>No man was more gratefully &s;en&s;ible of any kindne&s;s done to him than John&s;on. There is a little circum&s;tance in his diary this year, which &s;hews him in a very amiable light.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"July 2. I paid Mr. Simp&s;on<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Simp&s;on, E&s;q. mentioned in p. 188.

<P>Here he had a plea&s;ing opportunity of doing the &s;ame kindne&s;s to an old friend, which he had formerly received from him. Indeed his liberality as to money was very remarkable.

<P>His prayer in the view of becoming a politician is entitled, <Q REND="inline">"Engaging in POLITICKS with H&mdash;n,"</Q> no doubt his friend, the Right Honourable William Gerard Hamilton, for whom, during a long acquaintance, he had a great e&s;teem, and to who&s;e conver&s;ation he once paid this high compli|ment: <Q REND="inline">"I am very unwilling to be left alone, Sir, and therefore I go with my company down the fir&s;t pair of &s;tairs, in &s;ome hopes that they may, per|haps, return again. I go with you, Sir, as far as the &s;treet-door."</Q> In what particular department he intended to engage does not appear, nor can Mr. Hamilton explain. His prayer is in general terms. <Q REND="inline">"Enlighten my under|&s;tanding with knowledge of right, and govern my will by thy laws, that no deceit may mi&s;lead me, nor temptation corrupt me; that I may always endea|vour to do good, and hinder evil <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 67.</NOTE>."</Q> There is nothing upon the &s;ubject in his diary.</P>
<P>This year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his being introduced into the family of Mr. Thrale, one of the mo&s;t eminent brewers in England, and Member of Par|liament for the borough of Southwark. Foreigners are not a little amazed when they hear of brewers, di&s;tillers, and men in &s;imilar departments of trade, held forth as per&s;ons of con&s;iderable con&s;equence. In this great commercial country it is natural that a &s;ituation which produces much wealth &s;hould be con&s;idered as very re&s;pectable; and, no doubt, hone&s;t indu&s;try is entitled to e&s;teem. But, perhaps, the too rapid advance of men of low extraction tends to le&s;&s;en the value of that di&s;tinction by birth and gentility, which has ever been found beneficial to the grand &s;cheme of &s;ubordination. John&s;on u&s;ed to give this account of the ri&s;e of Mr. Thrale's father: <Q REND="inline">"He worked at &s;ix &s;hillings a week for twenty years in the great brewery, which afterwards was his own. The proprietor of it had an only daughter, who was married to a
<PB N="268" REF="299" MS="y">
 nobleman. It was not fit that a peer &s;hould continue the bu&s;ine&s;s. On the old man's death, therefore, the brewery was to be &s;old. To find a pur|cha&s;er for &s;o large a property was a difficult matter; and, after &s;ome time, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that it would be advi&s;eable to treat with Thrale, a &s;en&s;ible, active, hone&s;t man, who had been long employed in the hou&s;e, and to transfer the whole to him for thirty thou&s;and pounds, &s;ecurity being taken upon the property. This was accordingly &s;ettled. In eleven years Thrale paid the purcha&s;e-money. He acquired a large fortune, and lived to be Member of Parliament for Southwark. But what was mo&s;t remarkable was the liberality with which he u&s;ed his riches. He gave his &s;on and daughters the be&s;t education. The e&s;teem which his good conduct procured him from the nobleman who had married his ma&s;ter's daughter, made him be treated with much attention; and his &s;on, both at &s;chool and at the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, a&s;&s;ociated with young men of the fir&s;t rank. His allowance from his father, after he left college, was &s;plendid; no le&s;s than a thou&s;and a year. This, in a man who had ri&s;en as old Thrale did, was a very extraordinary in&s;tance of genero&s;ity. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'If this young dog does not find &s;o much after I am gone as he expects, let him remember that he has had a great deal in my own time."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;on, though in affluent circum&s;tances, had good &s;en&s;e enough to carry on his father's trade, which was of &s;uch extent, that I remember he once told me, he would not quit it for an annuity of ten thou&s;and a year; <Q REND="inline">"Not (&s;aid he,) that I get ten thou&s;and a year by it, but it is an e&s;tate to a family."</Q> Having left daughters only, the property was &s;old for the immen&s;e &s;um of one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds; a magnificent proof of what may be done by fair trade in no long period of time.</P>
<P>There may be &s;ome who think that a new &s;y&s;tem of gentility might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, upon principles totally different from what have hitherto prevailed. Our pre&s;ent heraldry, it may be &s;aid, is &s;uited to the barbarous times in which it had its origin. It is chiefly founded upon ferocious merit, upon military excellence. Why, in civili&s;ed times, we may be a&s;ked, &s;hould there not be rank and honours, upon principles, which, independent of long cu&s;tom, are certainly not le&s;s worthy, and which, when once allowed to be connected with elevation and precedency, would obtain the &s;ame dignity in our imagi|nation? Why &s;hould not the knowledge, the &s;kill, the expertne&s;s, the a&s;&s;iduity, and the &s;pirited hazards of trade and commerce, when crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, be entitled to give tho&s;e flattering di&s;tinctions by which man|kind are &s;o univer&s;ally captivated</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="300" MS="y">
Such are the &s;pecious, but fal&s;e arguments for a propo&s;ition which always will find numerous advocates, in a nation where men are every day &s;tarting up from ob&s;curity to wealth. To refute them is needle&s;s. The general &s;en&s;e of mankind cries out, with irre&s;i&s;tible force, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Un gentilhomme e&s;t toujours gentilhomme."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Thrale had married Mi&s;s He&s;ther Lynch Salu&s;bury, of good Welch extraction, a lady of lively talents, improved by education. That John&s;on's introduction into Mr. Thrale's family, which contributed &s;o much to the happine&s;s of his life, was owing to her de&s;ire for his conver&s;ation, is the mo&s;t probable and general &s;uppo&s;ition. But it is not the truth. Mr. Murphy, who was intimate with Mr. Thrale, having &s;poken very highly of Dr. John&s;on, he was reque&s;ted to make them acquainted. This being mentioned to John&s;on, he accepted of an invitation to dinner at Thrale's, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with his reception, both by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and they &s;o much plea&s;ed with him, that his invitations to their hou&s;e were more and more frequent, till at la&s;t he became one of the family, and an apartment was appropriated to him, both in their hou&s;e in Southwark, and in their villa at Streatham.</P>
<P>John&s;on had a very &s;incere e&s;teem for Mr. Thrale as a man of excellent principles, a good &s;cholar, well &s;killed in trade, of a &s;ound under&s;tanding, and of manners &s;uch as pre&s;ented the character of a plain independent Engli&s;h 'Squire. As this family will frequently be mentioned in the cour&s;e of the following pages, and as a fal&s;e notion has prevailed that Mr. Thrale was inferiour, and in &s;ome degree in&s;ignificant, compared with Mrs. Thrale, it may be proper to give a true &s;tate of the ca&s;e from the authority of John&s;on him&s;elf, in his own words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I know no man (&s;aid he,) who is more ma&s;ter of his wife and family than Thrale. If he but holds up a finger, he is obeyed. It is a great mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he is above him in literary attainments. She is more flippant; but he has ten times her learning: he is a regular &s;cholar; but her learning is that of a &s;chool-boy in one of the lower forms."</Q> My readers may naturally wi&s;h for &s;ome repre&s;entation of the figures of this couple. Mr. Thrale was tall, well proportioned, and &s;tately. As for <HI>Madam,</HI> or <HI>my Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> by which epithets John&s;on u&s;ed to mention Mrs. Thrale, &s;he was &s;hort, plump, and bri&s;k. She has her&s;elf given us a lively view of the idea which John&s;on had of her per|&s;on, on her appearing before him in a dark-coloured gown: <Q REND="inline">"You little creatures &s;hould never wear tho&s;e &s;ort of clothes, however; they are un&s;uit|able
<PB N="270" REF="301" MS="y">
 in every way. What! have not all in&s;ects gay colours <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 279.</NOTE>?"</Q> Mr. Thrale gave his wife a liberal indulgence, both in the choice of their company, and in the mode of entertaining them. He under&s;tood and valued John&s;on, with|out remi&s;&s;ion, from their fir&s;t acquaintance to the day of his death. Mrs. Thrale was enchanted with John&s;on's conver&s;ation for its own &s;ake, and had al&s;o a very allowable vanity in appearing to be honoured with the attention of &s;o celebrated a man.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more fortunate for John&s;on than this connection. He had at Mr. Thrale's all the comforts and even luxuries of life; his melancholy was diverted, and his irregular habits le&s;&s;ened by a&s;&s;ociation with an agreeable and well-ordered family. He was treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and even affection. The vivacity of Mrs. Thrale's literary talk rou&s;ed him to cheerful|ne&s;s and exertion, even when they were alone. But this was not often the ca&s;e; for he found here a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of what gave him the highe&s;t enjoy|ment, the &s;ociety of the learned, the witty, and the eminent in every way, who were a&s;&s;embled in numerous companies, called forth his wonderful powers, and gratified him with admiration, to which no man could be in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the October of this year he at length gave to the world his edition of Shak&s;peare, which, if it had no other merit but that of producing his Preface, in which the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are di&s;played with a ma&s;terly hand, the nation would have had no rea&s;on to complain. A blind indi&s;criminate admiration of Shak&s;peare had expo&s;ed the Briti&s;h nation to the ridicule of foreigners. John&s;on, by candidly admitting the faults of his poet, had the more credit in be&s;towing on him de&s;erved and indi&s;putable prai&s;e; and doubtle&s;s none of all his panegyri&s;ts have done him half &s;o much honour. Their prai&s;e was, like that of a coun&s;el, upon his own &s;ide of the cau&s;e: John&s;on's was like' the grave, well con&s;idered, and impartial opinion of the judge, which falls from his lips with weight, and is received with reverence. What he did as a commentator has no &s;mall &s;hare of merit, though his re&s;earches were not &s;o ample, and his inve&s;tigations &s;o acute as they might have been, which we now certainly know from the labours of other able and ingenious criticks who have followed him. He has enriched his edition with a conci&s;e account of each play, and of its characteri&s;tick excellence. Many of his notes have illu&s;trated ob&s;curities in the text, and placed pa&s;&s;ages eminent for beauty in a more con&s;picuous light; and he has, in general, exhibited &s;uch a mode of annotation, as may be beneficial to all &s;ub&s;equent editors.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="302" MS="y">
His Shak&s;peare was virulently attacked by Mr. William Kenrick, who obtained the degree of LL. D. from a Scotch Univer&s;ity, and wrote for the book&s;ellers in a great variety of branches. Though he certainly was not with|out con&s;iderable merit, he wrote with &s;o little regard to principle and decorum, and in &s;o ha&s;ty a manner, that his reputation was neither exten&s;ive nor la&s;ting. I remember one evening, when &s;ome of his works were mentioned, Dr. Gold&s;mith &s;aid, he had never heard' of them; upon which Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is one of the many who have made them&s;elves <HI>publick,</HI> without making them&s;elves <HI>known."</HI></Q></P>
<P>A young &s;tudent of Oxford, of the name of Barclay, wrote an an&s;wer to Kenrick's review of John&s;on's Shak&s;peare. John&s;on was at fir&s;t angry that Kenrick's attack &s;hould have the credit of an an&s;wer. But afterwards, con|&s;idering the young man's good intention, he kindly noticed him, and probably would have done more, had not the young man died.</P>
<P>In his Preface to Shak&s;peare, John&s;on treated Voltaire very contemptuou&s;ly, ob&s;erving, upon &s;ome of his remarks, <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are the petty critici&s;ms of petty wits."</Q> Voltaire, in revenge, made an attack upon John&s;on, in one of his numerous literary &s;allies, which I remember to have read; but there being no general index to his voluminous works, have &s;earched for it in vain, and therefore cannot quote it.</P>
<P>Voltaire was an antagoni&s;t with whom I thought John&s;on &s;hould not di&s;dain to contend. I pre&s;&s;ed him to an&s;wer. He &s;aid, he perhaps might: but he never did.</P>
<P>Mr. Burney having occa&s;ion to write to John&s;on for &s;ome receipts for &s;ub&s;criptions to his Shak&s;peare, which John&s;on had omitted to deliver, when the money was paid, he availed him&s;elf of that opportunity of thanking John&s;on for the great plea&s;ure which he had received from the peru&s;al of his Preface to Shak&s;peare; which although it excited much clamour again&s;t him at fir&s;t, is now ju&s;tly ranked among the mo&s;t excellent of his writings. To this letter, John&s;on returned the following an&s;wer:

<P>This un&s;olicited mark of di&s;tinction, conferred on &s;o great a literary cha|racter, did much honour to the judgement and liberal &s;pirit of that learned body. John&s;on acknowledged the favour in a letter to Dr. Leland, one of their number; but I have not been able to obtain a copy of it.</P>
<P>Both in 1764 and 1765 it &s;hould &s;eem that he was &s;o bu&s;ily employed with his edition of Shak&s;peare, as to have had little lei&s;ure for any other literary exertion, or, indeed, even for private corre&s;pondence. He did not favour me with a &s;ingle letter for more than two years, for which it will appear that he afterwards apologi&s;ed.</P>
<P>He was, however, at all times ready to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his friends, and others, in revi&s;ing their works, and in writing for them&punc; or greatly improving their Dedications. In that courtly &s;pecies of compo&s;ition no man excelled Dr. John&s;on. Though the loftine&s;s of his mind prevented him from ever dedicating in his own&punc;per&s;on, he wrote a very great number of Dedications
<PB N="273" REF="304" MS="y">
for others. Some of the&s;e, the per&s;ons who were favoured with them are unwilling &s;hould be mentioned, from a too anxious apprehen&s;ion, as I think, that they might be &s;u&s;pected of having received larger a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;ome, after all the diligence I have be&s;towed, have e&s;caped my inquiries. He told me, a great many years ago, <Q REND="inline">"he believed he had dedicated to all the Royal Family round;''</Q> and it was indifferent to him what was the &s;ubject of the work dedicated, provided it were innocent. He once dedicated &s;ome Mu&s;ick for the German Flute to Edward Duke of York. In writing Dedications for others, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as by no means &s;peaking his own &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his long &s;ilence, I never omitted to write to him when I had any thing worthy of communicating. I generally kept copies of my letters to him, that I might have a full view of our corre&s;pondence, and never be at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand any reference in his letters. He kept the greater part of mine very carefully; and a &s;hort time before his death was attentive enough to &s;eal them up in bundles, and order them to be delivered to me, which was accordingly done. Among&s;t them I found one, of which I had not made a copy, and which I own I read with plea&s;ure at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t twenty years. It is dated November, 1765, at the palace of Pa&s;cal Paoli, in Corte, the capital of Cor&s;ica, and is full of generous enthu|&s;ia&s;m. After giving a &s;ketch of what I had &s;een and heard in that i&s;land, it proceeded thus: <Q REND="inline">"I dare to call this a &s;pirited tour. I dare to challenge your approbation."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>APOLOGIES are &s;eldom of any u&s;e. We will delay till your arrival the rea&s;ons, good or bad, which have made me &s;uch a &s;paring and ungrateful corre&s;pondent. Be a&s;&s;ured, for the pre&s;ent, that nothing has le&s;&s;ened either the e&s;teem or love with which I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed you at Harwich. Both have been increa&s;ed by all that I have been told of you by your&s;elf or others; and when you return, you will return to an unaltered, and, I hope, unalterable friend.</P>
<P>All that you have to fear from me is the vexation of di&s;appointing me. No man loves to fru&s;trate expectations which have been formed in his favour; and the plea&s;ure which I promi&s;e my&s;elf from your journals and remarks is
<PB N="274" REF="305">
 &s;o great, that perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be &s;ufficient to afford it.</P>
<P>Come home, however, and take your chance. I long to &s;ee you, and to&punc; hear you; and hope that we &s;hall not be &s;o long &s;eparated again. Come home, and expect &s;uch a welcome as is due to him, whom a wi&s;e and noble curio&s;ity has led, where perhaps no native of this country ever was before.</P>
<P>I have no news to tell you that can de&s;erve your notice; nor would I willingly le&s;&s;en the plea&s;ure that any novelty may give you at your return. I am afraid we &s;hall find it difficult to keep among us a mind which has been&punc; &s;o long fea&s;ted with variety. But let us try what e&s;teem and kindne&s;s can effect.</P>
<P>As your father's liberality has indulged you with &s;o long a ramble, I doubt not but you will think his &s;ickne&s;s, or even his de&s;ire to &s;ee you, a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for ha&s;tening your return. The longer we live, and the more we think, the higher value we learn to put on the friend&s;hip and tenderne&s;s of parents and of friends. Parents we can have but once; and he promi&s;es him&s;elf too much, who enters life with the expectation of finding many friends. Upon &s;ome motive, I hope, that you will be here &s;oon; and am willing to think that it will be an inducement to your return, that it is &s;incerely de&s;ired by,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>dear Sir, </SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your affectionate humble &s;ervant, SAM. JOHNSON.</SIGNED>
<DATELINE>John&s;on's-court, Fleet-&s;treet, <DATE>January 14, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I returned to London in February, and found Dr. John&s;on in a good hou&s;e in John&s;on's-court, Fleet-&s;treet, in which he had accommodated Mi&s;s Williams with an apartment on the ground floor, while Mr. Levett occupied his po&s;t in the garret: his faithful Francis was &s;till attending upon him. He received me with much kindne&s;s. The fragments of our fir&s;t conver&s;ation, which I have pre&s;erved, are the&s;e: I told him that Voltaire, in a conver&s;ation with me, had di&s;tingui&s;hed Pope and Dryden thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pope drives a hand&s;ome chariot, with a couple of neat trim nags; Dryden a coach, and &s;ix &s;tately hor&s;es."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the truth is, they both drive coaches and &s;ix; but Dryden's hor&s;es are either galloping or &s;tumbling: Pope's go at a &s;teady even trot <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarkable, that Mr. Gray has employed&punc; &s;omewhat the &s;ame image to characteri&s;e Dryden. He, indeed, furni&s;hes his car with but two hor&s;es; but they are of ethereal race:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Behold where Dryden's le&s;s pre&s;umptuous car,</L>
<L>"Wide o'er the fields of glory bear</L>
<L>"Two cour&s;ers of ethereal race,</L>
<L>"With necks in thunder cloath'd, and long-re&s;ounding pace."</L>
<L>Ode on the Progre&s;s of Poe&s;y.</L>
</LG></Q></NOTE>."</Q>
<PB N="275" REF="306" MS="y">
He &s;aid of Gold&s;mith's Traveller, which had been publi&s;hed in my ab&s;ence,  <Q REND="inline">"There has not been &s;o fine a poem &s;ince Pope's time."</Q></P>
<P>And here it is proper to &s;ettle, with authentick preci&s;ion, what has long floated in publick report, as to John&s;on's being him&s;elf the authour of a con|&s;iderable part of that poem. Much, no doubt, both of the &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ion, were derived from conver&s;ation with him; and it was certainly &s;ubmitted to his friendly revi&s;ion: but in the year 1783, he, at my reque&s;t, marked with a pencil the lines which he had furni&s;hed, which are only line 420,
<Q><L>"To &s;top too fearful, and too faint to go;"</L></Q>
and the concluding ten lines, except the la&s;t couplet but one, which I di&s;tin|gui&s;h by the Italick character:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>" How &s;mall of all that human hearts endure,</L>
<L>" That part which kings or laws can cau&s;e or cure.</L>
<L>" Still to our&s;elves in every place con&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>" Our own felicity we make or find;</L>
<L>" With &s;ecret cour&s;e, which no loud &s;torms annoy,</L>
<L>" Glides the &s;mooth current of dome&s;tick joy.</L>
<L>" The lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,</L>
<L>" Luke's iron crown, and Damien's bed of &s;teel,</L>
<L>" To men remote from power, but rarely known,</L>
<L>" Leave rea&s;on, faith, and con&s;cience, all our own."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He added, <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are all of which I can be &s;ure."</Q> They bear a &s;mall proportion to the whole, which con&s;i&s;ts of four hundred and thirty-eight ver&s;es. Gold&s;mith, in the couplet which he in&s;erted, mentions <HI>Luke</HI> as a per&s;on well known, and &s;uperficial readers have pa&s;&s;ed it over quite &s;moothly; while tho&s;e of more attention have been as much perplexed by <HI>Luke,</HI> as by <HI>Lydiat,</HI> in <Q REND="inline">"The Vanity of human Wi&s;hes."</Q> The truth is, that Gold&s;mith him&s;elf was in a mi&s;take. In the <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Re&s;publica Hungarica,"</HI></Q> there is an account of a de&s;perate rebellion in the year 1514, headed by two brothers, of the name of <HI>Zeck,</HI> George and Luke. When it was quelled, <HI>George,</HI> not <HI>Luke,</HI> was puni&s;hed by his head being encircled with a red hot iron crown: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"coron&acirc; conde&s;cente ferre&acirc; coronatur."</HI></Q> The &s;ame &s;everity of torture was exerci&s;ed on the Earl of Athol, one of the murderers of King James I. of Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="307" MS="y">
 Dr. John&s;on at the &s;ame time favoured me by marking the lines which he furni&s;hed to Gold&s;mith's <Q REND="inline">"De&s;erted Village,"</Q> which are only the four la&s;t:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"That trade's proud empire ha&s;tes to &s;wift decay,</L>
<L>"As ocean &s;weeps the labour'd mole away:</L>
<L>"While &s;elf-dependent power can time defy,</L>
<L>"As rocks re&s;i&s;t the billows and the &s;ky."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Talking of education, <Q REND="inline">"People have now a days, (&s;aid he,) got a &s;trange opinion that every thing &s;hould be taught by lectures. Now, I cannot &s;ee that lectures can do &s;o much good as reading the books from which the lectures are taken. I know nothing that can be be&s;t taught by lectures, except where experiments are to be &s;hewn. You may teach chymi&s;try by lectures.&mdash;You might teach making of &s;hoes by lectures!"</Q></P>
<P>At night I &s;upped with him at the Mitre tavern, that we might renew our &s;ocial intimacy at the original place of meeting. But there was now a con|&s;iderable differenc&eacute; in his way of living. Having had an illne&s;s, in which he was advi&s;ed to leave off wine, he had, from that period, continued to ab&s;tain from it, and drank only water, or lemonade.</P>
<P>I told him that a foreign friend of his, whom I had met with abroad, was &s;o wretchedly perverted to infidelity, that he treated the hopes of immortality with brutal levity; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"As man dies like a dog, let him lie like a dog."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline"><HI>"If</HI> he dies like a dog, <HI>let</HI> him lie like a dog."</Q> I added, that this man &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"I hate mankind, for I think my&s;elf one of the be&s;t of them, and I know how bad I am."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he mu&s;t be very &s;ingular in his opinion, if he thinks him&s;elf one of the be&s;t of men; for none of his friends think him &s;o."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"No hone&s;t man could be a Dei&s;t; for no man could be &s;o after a fair examination of the proofs of Chri&s;tianity."</Q> I named Hume. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; Hume owned to a clergyman in the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, that he had never read the New Te&s;tament with atten|tion."</Q> I mentioned Hume's notion, that all who are happy are equally happy; a little mi&s;s with a new gown at a dancing-&s;chool ball, a general at the head of a victorious army, and an orator, after having made an eloquent &s;peech in a great a&s;&s;embly. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that all who are happy, are equally happy, is not true. A pea&s;ant and a philo&s;opher may be equally <HI>&s;atisfied,</HI> but not equally <HI>happy.</HI> Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the multiplicity of agreeable con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s. A pea&s;ant has not capacity for having equal happine&s;s with a philo&s;o|pher."</Q> I remember this very que&s;tion very happily illu&s;trated in oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="277" REF="308" MS="y">
Hume, by the Reverend Mr. Robert Brown, at Utrecht. <Q REND="inline">"A &s;mall drinking gla&s;s and a large one, (&s;aid he,) may be equally full; but the large one holds more than the &s;mall."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was very kind this evening, and &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"You have now lived five-and-twenty years, and you have employed them well."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alas, Sir, (&s;aid I,) I fear not. Do I know hi&s;tory? Do I know mathematicks? Do I know law?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, though you may know no &s;cience &s;o well as to be able to teach it, and no profe&s;&s;ion &s;o well as to be able to follow it, your general ma&s;s of knowledge of books and men renders you very capable to make your&s;elf ma&s;ter of any &s;cience, or fit your&s;elf for any profe&s;&s;ion."</Q> I mentioned that a gay friend had advi&s;ed me again&s;t being a lawyer, becau&s;e I &s;hould be excelled by plodding blockheads. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, in the formulary and &s;tatutory part of law, a plodding block|head may excel; but in the ingenious and rational part of it a plodding blockhead can never excel."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of the mode adopted by &s;ome to ri&s;e in the world, by courting great men, and a&s;ked him whether he had ever &s;ubmitted to it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I never was near enough to great men to court them. You may be prudently attached to great men, and yet independent. You are not to do what you think wrong; and, Sir, you are to calculate and not pay too dear for what you get. You mu&s;t not give a &s;hilling's worth of court for &s;ix-pence worth of good. But if you can get a &s;hilling's worth of good for &s;ix-pence worth of court, you are a fool if you do not pay court."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If convents &s;hould be allowed at all, they &s;hould only be retreats for per&s;ons unable to &s;erve the publick, or who have &s;erved it. It is our fir&s;t duty to &s;erve &s;ociety, and, after we have done that, we may attend wholly to the &s;alvation of our own &s;ouls. A youthful pa&s;&s;ion for ab&s;tracted devotion &s;hould not be encouraged."</Q></P>
<P>I introduced the &s;ubject of &s;econd &s;ight, and other my&s;terious manife&s;tations; the fulfilment of which, I &s;ugge&s;ted might happen by chance. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but they have happened &s;o often, that mankind have agreed to think them not fortuitous."</Q></P>
<P>I talked to him a great deal of what I had &s;een in Cor&s;ica, and of my intention to publi&s;h an account of it. He encouraged me by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"You cannot go to the bottom of the &s;ubject; but all that you tell us will be new to us. Give us as many anecdotes as you can."</Q></P>
<P>Our next meeting at the Mitre was on Saturday the 15th of February, when I pre&s;ented to him my old and mo&s;t intimate friend, the Reverend Mr. Temple,
<PB N="278" REF="309" MS="y">
 then of Cambridge. I having mentioned that I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with Rou&s;&s;eau in his wild retreat, and having quoted &s;ome remark made by Mr. Wilkes, with whom I had &s;pent many plea&s;ant hours in Italy, John&s;on &s;aid, (&s;arca&s;tically,) <Q REND="inline">"It &s;eems, Sir, you have kept very good company abroad, Rou&s;&s;eau and Wilkes!"</Q> Thinking it enough to defend one at a time, I &s;aid nothing as to my gay friend, but an&s;wered with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, you don't call Rou&s;&s;eau bad company. Do you really think <HI>him</HI> a bad man?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you are talking je&s;tingly of this, I don't talk with you. If you mean to be &s;erious, I think him one of the wor&s;t of men; a ra&s;cal, who ought to be hunted out of &s;ociety, as he has been. Three or four nations have ex|pelled him; and it is a &s;hame that he is protected in this country."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't deny, Sir, but that his novel may, perhaps, do harm; but I cannot think his intention was bad."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that will not do. We cannot prove any man's intention to be bad. You may &s;hoot a man through the head, and &s;ay you intended to mi&s;s him; but the Judge will order you to be hanged. An alledged want of intention, when evil is committed, will not be allowed in a court of ju&s;tice. Rou&s;&s;eau, Sir, is a very bad man. I would &s;ooner &s;ign a &s;entence for his tran&s;portation, than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey the&s;e many years. Yes, I &s;hould like to have him work in the plantations."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, do you think him as bad a man as Voltaire?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is difficult to &s;ettle the proportion of iniquity between them."</Q></P>
<P>This violence &s;eemed very &s;trange to me, who had read many of Rou&s;&s;eau's animated writings with great plea&s;ure, and even edification, had been much plea&s;ed with his &s;ociety, and was ju&s;t come from the Continent, where he was very generally admired. Nor can I yet allow that he de&s;erves the very &s;evere cen&s;ure which John&s;on pronounced upon him. His ab&s;urd preference of &s;avage to civili&s;ed life, and other &s;ingularities, are proofs rather of a defect in his under&s;tanding, than of any depravity in his heart. And notwith&s;tanding the unfavourable opinion which many worthy men have expre&s;&s;ed of his <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Profe&s;&s;ion de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard,"</HI></Q> I cannot help admiring it as the per|formance of a man full of &s;incere reverential &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Divine My&s;tery, though be&s;et with perplexing doubts; a &s;tate of mind to be&punc; viewed with pity rather than with anger.</P>
<P>On his favourite &s;ubject of &s;ubordination, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"So far is it from being true that men are naturally equal, that no two people can be half an hour together, but one &s;hall acquire an evident &s;uperiority over the other."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="310" MS="y">
I mentioned the advice given us by philo&s;ophers, to con&s;ole our&s;elves, when di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or embarra&s;&s;ed, by thinking of tho&s;e who are in a worfe &s;ituation than our&s;elves. This, I ob&s;erved, could not apply to all, for there mu&s;t be &s;ome who have nobody wor&s;e than they are. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why to be &s;ure, Sir, there are; but they don't know it. There is no being &s;o poor and &s;o contemptible, who does not think there is &s;omebody &s;till poorer, and &s;till more contemptible."</Q></P>
<P>As my &s;tay in London at this time was very &s;hort, I had not many oppor|tunities of being with Dr. John&s;on; but I felt my veneration for him in no degree le&s;&s;ened, by my having &s;een <HI>multorum hominum mores et urbes.</HI> On the contrary, by having it in my power to compare him with many of the mo&s;t celebrated per&s;ons of other countries, my admiration of his extraordinary mind was increa&s;ed and confirmed.</P>
<P>The roughne&s;s, indeed, which &s;ometimes appeared in his manners, was more &s;triking to me now, from my having been accu&s;tomed to the &s;tudied &s;mooth complying habits of the Continent; and I clearly recogni&s;ed in him, not without re&s;pect for his hone&s;t con&s;cientious zeal, the &s;ame indignant and &s;arca&s;tical mode of treating every&punc;attempt to unhinge or weaken good principles.</P>
<P>One evening, when a young gentleman teized him with an account of the infidelity of his &s;ervant, who, he &s;aid, would not believe the &s;criptures, becau&s;e he could not read them in the original tongues, and be &s;ure that they were not invented. <Q REND="inline">"Why, fooli&s;h fellow, (&s;aid John&s;on,) has he any better authority for almo&s;t every thing that he believes?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then the vulgar, Sir, never can know they are right, but mu&s;t &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the learned."</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir. The vulgar are the children of the &s;tate, and mu&s;t be taught like children."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, a poor Turk mu&s;t be a Maho|metan, ju&s;t as a poor Engli&s;hman mu&s;t be a Chri&s;tian?"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; and what then? This now is &s;uch &s;tuff as I u&s;ed to talk to my mother, when I fir&s;t began to think my&s;elf a clever fellow; and &s;he ought to have whipt me for it."</Q></P>
<P>Another evening Dr. Gold&s;mith and I called on him, with the hope of prevailing on him to &s;up with us at the Mitre. We found him indi&s;po&s;ed, and re&s;olved not to go abroad. <Q REND="inline">"Come then, (&s;aid Gold&s;mith,) we will not go to the Mitre to-night, &s;ince we cannot have the big man with us."</Q> John&s;on then called for a bottle of port, of which Gold&s;mith and I partook, while our friend, now a water drinker &s;at by us. GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"I think, Mr. John&s;on, you don't go near the theatres now. You give your&s;elf no more concern about a new
<PB N="280" REF="311" MS="y">
 play, than if you had never had any thing to do with the &s;tage."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, our ta&s;tes greatly alter. The lad does not care for the child's rattle, and the old man does not care for the young man's whore."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir; but your Mu&s;e was not a whore."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not think &s;he was. But as we advance in the journey of life, we drop &s;ome of the things which have plea&s;ed us; whether it be that we are fatigued and don't choo&s;e to carry &s;o many things any farther, or that we find other things which we like better."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, why don't you give us &s;omething in &s;ome other way?"</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Ay, Sir, we have a claim upon you."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I am not obliged to do any more. No man is obliged to do as much as he can do. A man is to have part of his life to him&s;elf. If a &s;oldier has fought a good many campaigns, he is not to be blamed if he retires to ea&s;e and tranquillity. A phy&s;ician, who has practi&s;ed long in a great city, may be excu&s;ed if he retires to a &s;mall town, and takes le&s;s practice. Now, Sir, the good I can do by my conver&s;ation bears the &s;ame proportion to the good I can do by my writings, that the practice of a phy&s;ician, retired to a &s;mall town, does to his practice in a great city."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But I wonder, Sir, you have not more plea&s;ure in writing than in not writing."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you <HI>may</HI> wonder."</Q></P>
<P>He talked of making ver&s;es, and ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"The great difficulty is to know when you have made good ones. When compo&s;ing, I have generally had them in my mind, perhaps fifty at a time, walking up and down in my room; and then I have wrote them down, and often, from lazine&s;s, have written only half lines. I have written a hundred lines in a day. I remember I wrote a hundred lines of <Q REND="inline">"The Vanity of human Wi&s;hes"</Q> in a day. Doctor, (turn|ing to Gold&s;mith,) I am not quite idle; I made one line t'other day; but I made no more."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Let us hear it; we'll put a bad one to it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; I have forgot it."</Q></P>
<P>Such &s;pecimens of the ea&s;y and playful conver&s;ation of the great Dr. Samuel John&s;on are, I think, to be prized; as exhibiting the little varieties of a mind &s;o enlarged and &s;o powerful when objects of con&s;equence required its exertions, and as giving us a minute knowledge of his character and modes of thinking.</P>
<P>After I had been &s;ome time in Scotland, I mentioned to him in a letter that <Q REND="inline">"On my fir&s;t return to my native country, after &s;ome years of ab&s;ence, I was told of a va&s;t number of my acquaintance who were all gone to the land of for|getfulne&s;s, and I found my&s;elf like a man &s;talking over a field of battle, who every moment perceives &s;ome one lying dead."</Q> I complained of irre&s;olution,
<PB N="281" REF="312">
and mentioned my having made a vow as a &s;ecurity for good conduct. I wrote to him again, without being able to move his indolence; nor did I hear from him till he had received a copy of my inaugural Exerci&s;e, or The&s;is in Civil Law, which I publi&s;hed at my admi&s;&s;ion as an Advocate, as is the cu&s;tom in Scotland. He then wrote to me as follows:

<P>I have now vexed you enough, and will try to plea&s;e you.

<P>You ought to think it no &s;mall inducement to diligence and per&s;everance, that they will plea&s;e your father.

<P>I PLEAD not guilty to<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;age omitted explained the tran&s;action to which the preceding letter had alluded.</NOTE> ****************************.</P>
<P>Having thus, I hope cleared my&s;elf of the charge brought again&s;t me, I pre&s;ume you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed if I e&s;cape the puni&s;hment which you have decreed for me unheard. If you have di&s;charged the arrows of critici&s;m again&s;t an innocent man, you mu&s;t rejoice to find they have mi&s;&s;ed him, or have not been pointed &s;o as to wound him.</P>
<P>To talk no longer in allegory, I am, with all deference, going to offer a few ob&s;ervations in defence of my Latin, which you have found fault with.</P>
<P>You think I &s;hould have u&s;ed <HI>&s;pei primae,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;pei alterae. Spes</HI> is, indeed, often u&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;omething on which we have a future depen|dence, as in Virg. Eclog. i. l. 14,
<Q><L>'&mdash;modo namque gemellos</L>
<L><HI>'Spem</HI> gregis ah &s;ilice in nud&acirc; connixa reliquit.'</L></Q>
and in Georg. iii. l. 473,
<Q><L><HI>'Spemque</HI> gregemque &s;imul,'</L></Q>
for the lambs and the &s;heep. Yet it is al&s;o u&s;ed to expre&s;s any thing on which we have a pre&s;ent dependence, and is well applied to a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed influence, our &s;upport, our refuge, our <HI>prae&s;idium,</HI> as Horace calls Maecenas. So, Aeneid xii. l. 57, Queen Amata addre&s;&s;es her &s;on-in-law Turnus:&mdash;'Spes <HI>tu nunc una;'</HI> and he was then no future hope, for &s;he adds,

 which might have been &s;aid of my Lord Bute &s;ome years ago.

<Q><L>'Et juxta A&s;canius, magnae <HI>&s;pes altera</HI> Romae.'</L></Q></P>
<P>You think <HI>alterae</HI> ungrammatical, and you tell me it &s;hould have been <HI>alteri.</HI> You mu&s;t recollect, that in old times <HI>alter</HI> was declined regularly; and when the ancient fragments pre&s;erved in the <HI>Juris Civilis Fontes</HI> were written, it was certainly declined in the way that I u&s;e it. This, I &s;hould think, may protect a lawyer who writes <HI>alterae</HI> in a di&s;&s;ertation upon part of his own &s;cience. But as I could hardly venture to quote fragments of old law to &s;o cla&s;&s;ical a man as Mr. John&s;on, I have not made an accurate &s;earch into the&s;e remains, to find examples of what I am able to produce in poetical compo&s;ition. We find in Plaut. Rudens, act iii. &s;cene 4,
<Q><L>'Nam huic <HI>alterae</HI> patria quae &s;it profecto ne&s;cio.'</L></Q>
Plautus is, to be &s;ure, an old comick writer: but in the days of Scipio and Lelius, we find, Terent. Heautontim. act ii. &s;cene 3,
<Q><L>'&mdash;hoc ip&s;a in itinere <HI>alterae</HI></L>
<L>'Dum narrat, forte audivi.'</L></Q></P>
<P>You doubt my having authority for u&s;ing <HI>genus</HI> ab&s;olutely, for what we call <HI>family,</HI> that is, for <HI>illu&s;trious extraction.</HI> Now I take <HI>genus</HI> in Latin, to have much the &s;ame &s;ignification with <HI>birth</HI> in Engli&s;h; both in their primary meaning expre&s;&s;ing &s;imply de&s;cent, but both made to &s;tand <GAP DESC="foreign">, for noble de&s;cent. <HI>Genus</HI> is thus u&s;ed in Hor. lib. ii. Sat. v. l. 8,
<Q><L>'Et <HI>genus</HI> et virtus, ni&s;i cum re, vilior alga e&s;t.'</L></Q>
And in lib. i. Epi&s;t. vi. l. 37,
<Q><L>'Et <HI>genus</HI> et forman Regina pecunia donat.'</L></Q>
And in the celebrated conte&s;t between Ajax and Uly&s;&s;es, Ovid's Metamorph. lib. xiii. l. 140,
<Q><L>'Nam <HI>genus</HI> et proavos, et quae non fecimus ip&s;t,</L>

<P>I have defended my&s;elf as well as I could.</P>
<P>Might I venture to differ from you with regard to the utility of vows? I am &s;en&s;ible that it would be very dangerous to make vows ra&s;hly, and with|out a due con&s;ideration. But I cannot help thinking that they may often be of great advantage to one of a variable judgement and irregular inclinations. I always remember a pa&s;&s;age in one of your letters to our Italian friend Baretti, where talking of the mona&s;tick life, you &s;ay you do not wonder that &s;erious men &s;hould put them&s;elves under the protection of a religious order, when they have found how unable they are to take care of them&s;elves.

<P>It appears from his diary, that he was this year at Mr. Thrale's, from before Mid&s;ummer till after Michaelmas, and that he afterwards pa&s;&s;ed a month at Oxford. He had then contracted a great intimacy with Mr. Chambers of that Univer&s;ity, now Sir Robert Chambers, one of the Judges in India.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed nothing this year in his own name; but the noble Dedication * to the King, of Gwyn's <Q REND="inline">"London and We&s;tmin&s;ter Improved,"</Q> was written by him; and he furni&s;hed the Preface, &dagger; and &s;everal of the pieces, which compo&s;e a volume of Mi&s;cellanies by Mrs. Anna Williams, the blind lady who had an a&s;ylum in his hou&s;e. Of the&s;e, there are his <Q REND="inline">"Epitaph on Philips, *"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Tran&s;la|tion of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer; &dagger;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Friend&s;hip, an Ode; *"</Q> and, <Q REND="inline">"The Ant, *"</Q> a paraphra&s;e from the Proverbs, of which I have a copy

 in his own hand-writing; and, from internal evidence, I a&s;cribe to him, <Q REND="inline">"To Mi&s;s&mdash;on her giving the Authour a gold and &s;ilk net-work Pur&s;e of her own weaving; &dagger;"</Q> and, <Q REND="inline">"The happy Life. &dagger;"</Q>&mdash;Mo&s;t of them have evidently received con&s;iderable additions from his &s;uperiour pen, particularly <Q REND="inline">"Ver&s;es to Mr. Richard&s;on, on his Sir Charles Grandi&s;on;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The Excur|&s;ion;"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Reflections on a Grave digging in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey."</Q> There is in this collection a poem <Q REND="inline">"On the Death of Stephen Grey, the Electrician; *"</Q> which, on reading it, appeared to me to be undoubtedly John&s;on's. I a&s;ked Mrs. Williams whether it was not his. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid &s;he, with &s;ome warmth,) I wrote that poem before I had the honour of Dr. John&s;on's acquaintance."</Q> I, however was &s;o much impre&s;&s;ed with my fir&s;t notion, that I mentioned it to John&s;on, repeating, at the &s;ame time, what Mrs. Williams had &s;aid. His an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"It is true, Sir, that &s;he wrote it before &s;he was acquainted with me; but &s;he has not told you that I wrote it all over again, except two lines."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The Fountains, &dagger;"</Q> a beautiful little Fairy tale in pro&s;e, written with exqui&s;ite &s;implicity, is one of John&s;on's productions; and I cannot with-hold from Mrs. Thrale the prai&s;e of being the authour of that admirable poem, <Q REND="inline">"The Three Warnings."</Q></P>
<P>He wrote this year a letter not intended for publication, which has, per|haps, as &s;trong marks of his &s;entiment and &s;tyle, as any of his compo&s;itions. The original is in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is addre&s;&s;ed to the late Mr. William Drummond, book&s;eller in Edinburgh, a gentleman of good family, but &s;mall e&s;tate, who took arms for the hou&s;e of Stuart in 1745; and during his con|cealment in London till the act of general pardon came out, obtained the acquaintance of Dr. John&s;on, who ju&s;tly e&s;teemed him as a very worthy man. It &s;eems, &s;ome of the members of the &s;ociety in Scotland for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge had oppo&s;ed the &s;cheme of tran&s;lating the holy &s;criptures into the Er&s;e or Gaelick language, from political con&s;iderations of the di&s;|advantage of keeping up the di&s;tinction between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of North-Britain. Dr. John&s;on being informed of this, I &s;uppo&s;e by Mr. Drummond, wrote with a generous indignation as follows:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>To Mr.</HI> WILLIAM DRUMMOND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not expect to hear that it could be, in an a&s;&s;embly convened for the propagation of Chri&s;tian knowledge, a que&s;tion whether any nation unin&s;tructed in religion &s;hould receive in&s;truction; or whether that in&s;truction
<PB N="287" REF="318">
&s;hould be imparted to them by a tran&s;lation of the holy books into their own  language. If obedience to the will of GOD be nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s, and knowledge of his will be nece&s;&s;ary to obedience, I know not how he that with-holds this knowledge, or delays it, can be &s;aid to love his neighbour as him&s;elf. He, that voluntarily continues ignorance, is guilty of all the crimes which ignorance produces; as to him, that &s;hould extingui&s;h the tapers of a light-hou&s;e, might ju&s;tly be imputed the calamities of &s;hipwrecks. Chri&s;tianity is the highe&s;t perfection of humanity; and as no man is good but as he wi&s;hes the good of others, no man can be good in the highe&s;t degree, who wi&s;hes not to others the large&s;t mea&s;ures of the greate&s;t good. To omit for a year, or for a day, the mo&s;t efficacious method of advancing Chri&s;tianity, in com|pliance with any purpo&s;es that terminate on this &s;ide of the grave, is a crime of which I know not that the world has yet had an example, except in the practice of the planters of America, a race of mortals whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, no other man wi&s;hes to re&s;emble.</P>
<P>The Papi&s;ts have, indeed, denied to the laity the u&s;e of the bible; but this prohibition, in few places now very rigorou&s;ly enforced, is defended by arguments, which have for their foundation the care of &s;ouls. To ob&s;cure, upon motives merely political, the light of revelation, is a practice re&s;erved for the reformed; and, &s;urely, the blacke&s;t midnight of popery is meridian &s;un|&s;hine to &s;uch a reformation. I am not very willing that any language &s;hould be totally extingui&s;hed. The &s;imilitude and derivation of languages afford the mo&s;t indubitable proof of the traduction of nations, and the genealogy of man|kind. They add often phy&s;ical certainty to hi&s;torical evidence; and often &s;upply the only evidence of ancient migrations, and of the revolutions of ages which left no written monuments behind them.</P>
<P>Every man's opinions, at lea&s;t his de&s;ires, are a little influenced by his favourite &s;tudies. My zeal for languages may &s;eem, perhaps, rather over|heated, even to tho&s;e by whom I de&s;ire to be well e&s;teemed. To tho&s;e who have nothing in their thoughts but trade or policy, pre&s;ent power, or pre&s;ent money, I &s;hould not think it nece&s;&s;ary to defend my opinions; but with men of letters I would not unwillingly compound, by wi&s;hing the continuance of every language, however narrow in its extent, or however incommodious for common purpo&s;es, till it is repo&s;ited in &s;ome ver&s;ion of a known book, that it may be always hereafter examined and compared with other languages, and then permitting its di&s;u&s;e. For this purpo&s;e, the tran&s;lation of the bible is mo&s;t to be de&s;ired. It is not certain that the &s;ame method will not pre&s;erve the Highland language, for the purpo&s;es of learning, and aboli&s;h it from
<PB N="288" REF="319">
 daily u&s;e. When the Highlanders read the Bible, they will naturally wi&s;h to have its ob&s;curities cleared, and to know the hi&s;tory, collateral or appendant. Knowledge always de&s;ires increa&s;e: it is like fire, which mu&s;t fir&s;t be kindled by &s;ome external agent, but which will afterwards propagate it&s;elf. When they once de&s;ire to learn, they will naturally have recour&s;e to the neare&s;t lan|guage by which that de&s;ire can be gratified; and one will tell another that if he would attain knowledge, he mu&s;t learn Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>This &s;peculation may, perhaps, be thought more &s;ubtle than the gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s of real life will ea&s;ily admit. Let it, however, be remembered, that the efficacy of ignorance has been long tried, and has not produced the con&s;e|quence expected. Let knowledge, therefore, take its turn; and let the patrons of privation &s;tand awhile a&s;ide, and admit the operation of po&s;itive principles.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed, Sir, to a&s;&s;ure the worthy man who is employed in the new tran&s;lation, that he has my wi&s;hes for his &s;ucce&s;s; and if here or at Oxford I can be of any u&s;e, that I &s;hall think it more than honour to promote his undertaking.</P>

<P>The Honourable Thomas Hervey and his lady having unhappily di&s;agreed, and being about to &s;eparate, John&s;on interfered as their friend, and wrote him a letter of expo&s;tulation, which I have not been able to find; but the &s;ub&s;tance of it is a&s;certained by a letter to John&s;on, in an&s;wer to it, which Mr. Hervey printed. The occa&s;ion of this corre&s;pondence between Dr. John&s;on and Mr. Hervey, was thus related to me by Mr. Beauclerk. <Q REND="inline">"Tom Hervey had a great liking for John&s;on, and in his will had left him a legacy of fifty pounds. One day he &s;aid to me, 'John&s;on may want this money now, more than afterwards. I have a mind to give it him directly. Will you be &s;o good as to carry a fifty pound note from me to him?' This I po&s;itively refu&s;ed to do, as he might, perhaps, have knocked me down for in&s;ulting him, and have afterwards put the note in his pocket. But I &s;aid, if Hervey would write him a letter, and enclo&s;e a fifty pound note, I &s;hould take care to deliver it. He accordingly did write him a letter, mentioning that he was only paying a legacy a little &s;ooner. To his letter he added, <HI>'P. S. I am going to part with my wife.'</HI> John&s;on then wrote to him, &s;aying nothing of the note, but remon&s;trating with him again&s;t parting with his wife."</Q></P>
<P>When I mentioned to John&s;on this &s;tory, in as delicate terms as I could, he told me that the fifty pound note was given to him by Mr. Hervey in con&s;ideration of his having written for him a pamphlet again&s;t Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, who, Mr. Harvey imagined, was the authour of an attack upon him; but that it was afterwards di&s;covered to be the work of a garret|teer, who wrote <Q REND="inline">"The Fool:"</Q> &s;o the pamphlet again&s;t Sir Charles was not printed.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1767"> In February, 1767, there happened one of the mo&s;t remarkable incidents of John&s;on's life, which gratified his monarchical enthu&s;ia&s;m, and which he loved to relate with all its circum&s;tances, when reque&s;ted by his friends. This was his being honoured by a private conver&s;ation with his Maje&s;ty, in the library at the Queen's hou&s;e. He had frequently vi&s;ited tho&s;e &s;plendid rooms
<PB N="292" REF="323">
<MILESTONE N="1767. Aetat. 58."> and noble collection of books <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on had the honour of contributing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the formation of this library; for I have read a long letter from him to Mr. Barnard, giving the mo&s;t ma&s;terly in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject. I wi&s;hed much to have gratified my readers with the peru&s;al of this letter, and have rea|&s;on to think that his Maje&s;ty would have been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to permit its publication; but Mr. Barnard, to whom I applied, declined it <Q REND="inline">"on his own account."</Q></NOTE>, which he u&s;ed to &s;ay was more numerous and curious than he &s;uppo&s;ed any per&s;on could have made in the time which the King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he &s;hould have every accommodation that could contribute to his ea&s;e and convenience, while indulging his literary ta&s;te in that place; &s;o that he had here a very agreeable re&s;ource at lei&s;ure hours.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having been informed of his occa&s;ional vi&s;its, was plea&s;ed to &s;ignify a de&s;ire that he &s;hould be told when Dr. John&s;on came next to the library. Accordingly, the next time that John&s;on did come, as &s;oon as he was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he &s;at by the fire, he &s;eemed quite intent, Mr. Barnard &s;tole round to the apartment where the King was, and, in obedience to his Maje&s;ty's commands, mentioned that Dr. John&s;on was then in the library. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid he was at lei&s;ure, and would go to him; upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that &s;tood on the King's table, and lighted his Maje&s;ty through a &s;uite of rooms, till they came to a private door into the library, of which his Maje&s;ty had the key. Being entered, Mr. Barnard &s;tepped forward ha&s;tily to Dr. John&s;on, who was &s;till in a profound &s;tudy, and whi&s;pered him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, here is the King."</Q> John&s;on &s;tarted up, and &s;tood &s;till. His Maje&s;ty approached him, and at once was courteou&s;ly ea&s;y <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The particulars of this conver&s;ation I have been at great pains to collect with the utmo&s;t authenticity, from Dr. John&s;on's own detail to my&s;elf; from Mr. Langton, who was pre&s;ent when he gave an account of it to Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, and &s;everal other friends, at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's; from Mr. Barnard; from the copy of a letter written by the late Mr. Strahan the printer, to Bi&s;hop Warburton; and from a minute, the original of which is among the papers of the late Sir James Caldwell, and a copy of which was mo&s;t obligingly obtained for me from his &s;on Sir John Caldwell, by Sir Francis Lumm. To all the&s;e gentlemen I beg leave to make my grate|ful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was plea&s;ed to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, one of his Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal plea&s;ure concerning it by a letter&punc; in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"I have the King's commands to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, how &s;en&s;ible his Maje&s;ty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the con|ver&s;ation previous to its publication. As there appears no objection to your complying with Mr. Bo&s;well's wi&s;hes on the &s;ubject, you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman, to make &s;uch u&s;e of in his Life of Dr. John&s;on, as he may think proper."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty began by ob&s;erving, that he under&s;tood he came &s;ometimes to the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been
<PB N="293" REF="324">
lately at Oxford, a&s;ked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which John&s;on an&s;wered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford &s;ometimes, but was likewi&s;e glad to come back again. The King then a&s;ked him what they were doing at Oxford. John&s;on an&s;wered, he could not much commend their diligence, but that in &s;ome re&s;pects they were mended, for they had put their pre&s;s under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius. He was then a&s;ked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge. He an&s;wered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam|bridge; at the &s;ame time adding, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, whether we have more books or not than they have at Cambridge, we &s;hall make as good u&s;e of them as they do."</Q> Being a&s;ked whether All-Souls or Chri&s;t-Church library was the large&s;t, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"All-Souls library is the large&s;t we have, except the Bodleian."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Aye, (&s;aid the King,) that is the publick library."</Q></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He an&s;wered, he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and mu&s;t now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it &s;hould &s;eem with a view to urge him to rely on his own &s;tores as an original writer, and to continue his labours, then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I do not think you borrow much from any body."</Q> John&s;on &s;aid, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have thought &s;o too, (&s;aid the King,) if you had not written &s;o well."</Q>&mdash;John&s;on ob&s;erved to me, upon this, that <Q REND="inline">"No man could have paid a hand|&s;omer compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was deci&s;ive."</Q> When a&s;ked by another friend, at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply to this high compliment, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. When the King had &s;aid it, it was to be &s;o. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my &s;overeign."</Q> Perhaps no man who had &s;pent his whole life in courts could have &s;hewn a more nice and dignified &s;en&s;e of true politene&s;s, than John&s;on did in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having ob&s;erved to him that he &s;uppo&s;ed he mu&s;t have read a great deal; John&s;on an&s;wered, that he thought more than he read; that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for in&s;tance, he &s;aid he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon which the King &s;aid, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of &s;uch general knowledge, that you could &s;carce talk with him on any &s;ubject on which he was not qualified to &s;peak; and that his learning re&s;embled Garrick's acting, in its univer&s;ality. His Maje&s;ty then talked of the controver&s;y between Warburton and Lowth, which he &s;eemed to have read, and a&s;ked John&s;on what he thought of it. John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Warburton has mo&s;t general&punc;
<PB N="294" REF="325" MS="y">
 mo&s;t &s;chola&s;tick learning; Lowth is the more correct &s;cholar. I do not know which of them calls names be&s;t."</Q> The King was plea&s;ed to &s;ay he was of the &s;ame opinion; adding, <Q REND="inline">"You do not think then, Dr. John&s;on, that there was much argument in the ca&s;e."</Q> John&s;on &s;aid, he did not think there was. <Q REND="inline">"Why truly, (&s;aid the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu|ment is pretty well at an end."</Q></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty then a&s;ked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton's hi&s;tory, which was then ju&s;t publi&s;hed. John&s;on &s;aid, he thought his &s;tyle pretty good, but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. <Q REND="inline">"Why, (&s;aid the King,) they &s;eldom do the&s;e things by halves."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, (an&s;wered John&s;on,) not to Kings."</Q> But fearing to be mi&s;under&s;tood, he proceeded to explain him&s;elf; and immediately &s;ubjoined, <Q REND="inline">"That for tho&s;e who &s;poke wor&s;e of Kings than they de&s;erved, he could find no excu&s;e, but that he could more ea&s;ily conceive how &s;ome might &s;peak better of them than they de&s;erved, without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give, tho&s;e who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge|rate their prai&s;es; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly excu&s;eable, as far as errour could be excu&s;eable."</Q></P>
<P>The King then a&s;ked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. John&s;on an&s;wered, that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately mentioned, as an in&s;tance of it, an a&s;&s;ertion of that writer, that he had &s;een objects magnified to a much greater degree by u&s;ing three or four micro|&s;copes at a time, than by u&s;ing one. <Q REND="inline">"Now, (added John&s;on,) every one acquainted with micro&s;copes knows, that the more of them he looks through, the le&s;s the object will appear."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, (replied the King,) this is not only telling an untruth, but telling it clum&s;ily; for, if that be the ca&s;e, every one who can look through a micro&s;cope will be able to detect him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I now, (&s;aid John&s;on to his friends, when relating what had pa&s;&s;ed,) began to con&s;ider that I was depreciating this man in the e&s;timation of his &s;overeign, and thought it was time for me to &s;ay &s;omething that might be more favourable."</Q> He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwith&s;tanding, a very curious ob&s;erver; and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew, he might have been a very con&s;iderable man, and needed not to have recour&s;e to &s;uch mean expedients to rai&s;e his reputation.</P>
<P>The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the <HI>Journal des Savans,</HI> and a&s;ked John&s;on if it was well done. John&s;on &s;aid, it was formerly very well done, and gave &s;ome account of the per&s;ons who
<PB N="295" REF="326" MS="y">
began it, and carried it on for &s;ome years; enlarging at the &s;ame time, on the  nature and u&s;e of &s;uch works. The King a&s;ked him if it was well done now. John&s;on an&s;wered, he had no rea&s;on to think that it was. The King then a&s;ked him if there were any other literary journals publi&s;hed in this kingdom, except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being an&s;wered there were no other, his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked which of them was the be&s;t: John&s;on an&s;wered, that the Monthly Review was done with mo&s;t care, the Critical upon the be&s;t principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies to the Church. This the King &s;aid he was &s;orry to hear.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation next turned on the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, when John&s;on ob&s;erved, that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, (&s;aid the King,) they are obliged to Dr. John&s;on for that;"</Q> for his Maje&s;ty had heard and remembered the circum|&s;tance, which John&s;on him&s;elf had forgot.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed, and propo&s;ed to Dr. John&s;on to undertake it. John&s;on &s;ignified his readine&s;s to comply with his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>During the whole of this interview, John&s;on talked to his Maje&s;ty with profound re&s;pect, but &s;till in his firm manly manner, with a &s;onorous voice, and never in that &s;ubdued tone which is commonly u&s;ed at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, John&s;on &s;hewed him&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with his Maje&s;ty's conver&s;ation and gracious behaviour. He &s;aid to Mr. Barnard, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the fine&s;t gentleman I have ever &s;een."</Q> And he afterwards ob&s;erved to Mr. Langton, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, his manners are tho&s;e of as fine a gentleman as we may &s;uppo&s;e Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second."</Q></P>
<P>At Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, where a circle of John&s;on's friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conver&s;ation, Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in pre&s;&s;ing him to mention the particulars. <Q REND="inline">"Come now, Sir, this is an intere&s;ting matter; do favour us with it."</Q> John&s;on, with great good humour, complied.</P>
<P>He told them, <Q REND="inline">"I found his Maje&s;ty wi&s;hed I &s;hould talk, and I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his &s;overeign. In the fir&s;t place, a man cannot be in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"</Q> Here &s;ome que&s;tion interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would have pointed out and illu&s;trated many circum&s;tances of advantage, from being in a &s;ituation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="327" MS="y">
 During all the time in which Dr. John&s;on was employed in relating to the circle at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynold's the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between the King and him, Dr. Gold&s;mith remained unmoved upon a &s;opha at &s;ome di&s;tance, affecting not to join in the lea&s;t in the eager curio&s;ity of the com|pany. He a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for his gloom and &s;eeming inattention, that he apprehended John&s;on had relinqui&s;hed his purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing him with a Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the &s;ingular honour Dr. John&s;on had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankne&s;s and &s;implicity of his natural character prevailed. He &s;prung from the &s;opha, advanced to John&s;on, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining him&s;elf in the &s;ituation which he had ju&s;t been hearing de&s;cribed, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, you acquitted your&s;elf in this conver&s;ation better than I &s;hould have done; for I &s;hould have bowed and &s;tammered through the whole of it."</Q></P>
<P>I received no letter from John&s;on this year; nor have I di&s;covered any of the corre&s;pondence<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">It is proper here to mention, that when I &s;peak of his corre&s;pondence, I con&s;ider it indepen|dent of the voluminous collection of letters which, in the cour&s;e of many years, he wrote to Mrs. Thrale, which forms a &s;eparate part of his works; and as a proof of the high e&s;timation &s;et on any thing which came from his pen, was &s;old by that lady for the &s;um of five hundred pounds.</NOTE> he had, except the two letters to Mr. Drummond, which have been in&s;erted, for the &s;ake of connection with that to the &s;ame gentleman in 1766. His diary affords no light as to his employment at this time. He pa&s;&s;ed three months at Lichfield; and I cannot omit an affecting and &s;olemn &s;cene there, as related by him&s;elf:</P>
<Q><P>Sunday, Oct. 18, 1767. Ye&s;terday, Oct. 17, at about ten in the morn|ing, I took my leave for ever of my dear old friend, Catherine Chambers, who came to live with my mother about 1724, and has been but little parted from us &s;ince. She buried my father, my brother, and my mother. She is now fifty-eight years old.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired all to withdraw, then told her that we were to part for ever; that as Chri&s;tians, we &s;hould part with prayer; and that I would, if &s;he was willing, &s;ay a &s;hort prayer be&s;ide her. She expre&s;&s;ed great de&s;ire to hear me; and held up her poor hands, as &s;he lay in bed, with great fervour, while I prayed, kneeling by her, nearly in the following words:</P>
<P>Almighty and mo&s;t merciful Father, who&s;e loving-kindne&s;s is over all thy works, behold, vi&s;it, and relieve this thy &s;ervant, who is grieved with &s;ickne&s;s. Grant that the &s;en&s;e of her weakne&s;s may add &s;trength to her faith, and &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s to her repentance. And grant that by the help of thy Holy Spirit, after the pains and labours of this &s;hort life, we may all obtain everla&s;ting happine&s;s,
<PB N="297" REF="328" MS="y">
through JESUS CHRIST our Lord; for who&s;e &s;ake hear our prayers. Amen. Our Father, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I then ki&s;&s;ed her. She told me, that to part was the greate&s;t pain that &s;he had ever felt, and that &s;he hoped we &s;hould meet again in a better place. I expre&s;&s;ed, with &s;welled eyes, and great emotion of tenderne&s;s, the &s;ame hopes. We ki&s;&s;ed, and parted. I humbly hope to meet again, and to part no more <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 77 and 78.</NOTE>.</P></Q>
<P>By tho&s;e who have been taught to look upon John&s;on as a man of a har&s;h and &s;tern character, let this tender and affectionate &s;cene be candidly read; and let them then judge whether more warmth of heart, and grateful kindne&s;s, is often found in human nature.</P>
<P>We have the following notice in his devotional record:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Augu&s;t 2, 1767. I have been di&s;turbed and un&s;ettled for a long time, and have been without re&s;olution to apply to &s;tudy or to bu&s;ine&s;s, being hin|dered by &s;udden &s;natches <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 73.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

I found he was at Oxford, with his friend Mr. Chambers, who was now Vinerian Profe&s;&s;or, and lived in New Inn Hall.

But, Sir, that is not enough. An argument which does not convince your&s;elf, may convince the Judge to whom you urge it: and if it does convince him, why then, Sir, you are wrong, and he is right. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to judge; and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cau&s;e is bad, but to &s;ay all you can for your client, and then hear the Judge's opinion."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth, and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion, does not &s;uch di&s;&s;imulation impair one's hone&s;ty? Is there not &s;ome danger that a lawyer may put on the &s;ame ma&s;k in common life, in the intercour&s;e with his friends?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir. Every body knows you are paid for affecting warmth for your client; and it is, therefore, properly no di&s;&s;imu|lation: the moment you come from the bar you re&s;ume your u&s;ual behaviour. Sir, a man will no more carry the artifice of the bar into the common inter|cour&s;e of &s;ociety, than a man who is paid for tumbling upon his hands will continue to tumble upon his hands when he &s;hould walk on his feet."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="330" MS="y">
Talking of &s;ome of the modern plays, he &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Fal&s;e Delicacy"</Q> was  totally void of character. He prai&s;ed Gold&s;mith's <Q REND="inline">"Good-natured Man;"</Q> &s;aid, it was the be&s;t comedy that had appeared &s;ince <Q REND="inline">"The Provoked Hu&s;|band,"</Q> and that there had not been of late any &s;uch character exhibited on the &s;tage as that of Croaker. I ob&s;erved it was the Su&s;pirius of his Rambler. He &s;aid, Gold&s;mith had owned he had borrowed it from thence. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (con|tinued he,) there is all the difference in the world between characters of nature and characters of manners; and <HI>there</HI> is the difference between the characters of Fielding and tho&s;e of Richard&s;on. Characters of manners are very entertaining; but they are to be under&s;tood, by a more &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, than characters of nature, where a man mu&s;t dive into the rece&s;&s;es of the human heart."</Q></P>
<P>It always appeared to me that he e&s;timated the compo&s;itions of Richard&s;on too highly, and that he had an unrea&s;onable prejudice again&s;t Fielding. In comparing tho&s;e two writers, he u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion; <Q REND="inline">"that there was as great a difference between them as between a man who knew how a watch was made, and a man who could tell the hour by looking on the dial-plate."</Q> This was a &s;hort and figurative &s;tate of his di&s;tinction between drawing characters of nature and characters only of manners. But I cannot help being of opinion, that the neat watches of Fielding are as well con&s;tructed as the large clocks of Richard&s;on, and that his dial-plates are brighter-Fielding's characters, though they do not expand them&s;elves &s;o widely in di&s;|&s;ertation, are as ju&s;t pictures of human nature, and I will venture to &s;ay, have more &s;triking features, and nicer touches of the pencil; and though John&s;on u&s;ed to quote with approbation a &s;aying of Richard&s;on's, <Q REND="inline">"that the virtues of Fielding's heroes were the vices of a truly good man,"</Q> I will venture to add, that the moral tendency of Fielding's writings, though it does not encourage a &s;trained and rarely po&s;&s;ible virtue, is ever favourable to honour and hone&s;ty, and cheri&s;hes the benevolent and generous affections. He who is as good as Fielding would make him, is an amiable member of &s;ociety, and may be led on by more regulated in&s;tructors, to a higher &s;tate of ethical perfection.</P>
<P>John&s;on proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"Even Sir Francis Wronghead is a character of man|ners, though drawn with great humour."</Q> He then repeated, very happily, all Sir Francis's credulous account to Manly of his being with <Q REND="inline">"the great man,"</Q> and &s;ecuring a place. I a&s;ked him if the <Q REND="inline">"Su&s;picious Hu&s;band"</Q> did not furni&s;h a well-drawn character, that of Ranger. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; Ranger is ju&s;t a rake, a mere rake, and a lively young fellow, but no <HI>character."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The great Douglas cau&s;e was at this time a very general &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion. I found he had not &s;tudied it with much attention, but had only heard
<PB N="300" REF="331" MS="y">
 parts of it occa&s;ionally. He, however, talked of it, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am of opinion that po&s;itive proof of fraud &s;hould not be required of the plaintiff, but that the Judges &s;hould decide according as probability &s;hall appear to preponderate, granting to the defendant the pre&s;umption of filiation to be &s;trong in his favour. And I think too, that a good deal of weight &s;hould be allowed to the dying declarations, becau&s;e they were &s;pontaneous. There is a great difference between what is &s;aid without our being urged to it, and what is &s;aid from a kind of compul&s;ion. If I prai&s;e a man's book without being a&s;ked my opinion of it, that is hone&s;t prai&s;e, to which one may tru&s;t. But if an authour a&s;ks me if I like his book, and I give him &s;omething like prai&s;e, it mu&s;t not be taken as my real opinion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"I have not been troubled for a long time with authours de&s;iring my opinion of their works. I u&s;ed once to be &s;adly plagued with a man who wrote ver&s;es, but who literally had no other notion of a ver&s;e, but that it con&s;i&s;ted of ten &s;yllables. <HI>Lay your knife and your fork acro&s;s your plate,</HI> was to him a ver&s;e:
<Q><L>Lay yo~ur knife a~nd your fo~rk, acro~&s;s your pla~te.</L></Q>
As he wrote a great number of ver&s;es he &s;ometimes by chance made good ones, though he did not know it."</Q></P>
<P>He renewed his promi&s;e of coming to Scotland, and going with me to the Hebrides, but &s;aid he would now content him&s;elf with &s;eeing one or two of the mo&s;t curious of them. He &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"Macaulay, who writes the account of St. Kilda, &s;et out with a prejudice again&s;t prejudices, and wanted to be a &s;mart modern thinker; and yet he affirms for a truth, that when a &s;hip arrives there all the inhabitants are &s;eized with a cold."</Q></P>
<P>He expatiated on the advantages of Oxford for learning. <Q REND="inline">"There is here, Sir, (&s;aid he,) &s;uch a progre&s;&s;ive emulation. The &s;tudents are anxious to appear well to their tutors; the tutors are anxious to have their pupils appear well in the college; the colleges are anxious to have their &s;tudents appear well in the Univer&s;ity; and there are excellent rules of di&s;cipline in every college. That the rules are &s;ometimes ill ob&s;erved, may be true; but is nothing again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem. The members of an Univer&s;ity may, for a &s;ea&s;on, be unmindful of their duty. I am arguing for the excellency of the in&s;titution."</Q></P>
<P>Of Guthrie he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is a man of parts. He has no great regular fund of knowledge; but by reading &s;o long, and writing &s;o long, he no doubt has picked up a good deal."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid he had lately been a long while at Lichfield, but had grown very weary before he left it. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I wonder at that, Sir; it is your native place&punc;"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o is Scotland <HI>your</HI> native place."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="332" MS="y">
His prejudice again&s;t Scotland appeared remarkably &s;trong at this time.  When I talked of our advancement in literature, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) you have learnt a little from us, and you think your&s;elves very great men. Hume would never have written Hi&s;tory, had not Voltaire written it before him. He is an echo of Voltaire."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, we have Lord Kames."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You <HI>have</HI> Lord Kames. Keep him; ha, ha, ha! We don't envy you him. Do you ever &s;ee Dr. Robert&s;on?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Does the dog talk of me?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir, he does, and loves you."</Q> Thinking that I now had him in a corner, and being &s;olicitous for the literary fame of my country, I pre&s;&s;ed him for his opinion on the merit of Dr. Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland. But, to my &s;urprize, he e&s;caped.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, I love Robert&s;on, and I won't talk of his book."</Q></P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice both to him and Dr. Robert&s;on to add, that though he indulged him&s;elf in this &s;ally of wit, he had too good ta&s;te not to be fully &s;en&s;ible of the merits of that admirable work.</P>
<P>An e&s;&s;ay, written by Mr. Deane, a divine of the Church of England, maintaining the future life of brutes, by an explication of certain parts of the &s;criptures, was mentioned, and the doctrine in&s;i&s;ted on by a gentleman who &s;eemed fond of curious &s;peculation. John&s;on, who did not like to hear of any thing concerning a future &s;tate which was not authori&s;ed by the regular canons of orthodoxy, di&s;couraged this talk; and being offended at its continua|tion, he watched an opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehen&s;ion. So, when the poor &s;peculati&s;t, with a &s;erious metaphy&s;ical pen&s;ive face, addre&s;&s;ed him, <Q REND="inline">"But really, Sir, when we &s;ee a very &s;en&s;ible dog, we don't know what to think of him."</Q> John&s;on, rolling with joy at the thought, which beamed in his eye, turned quickly round, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir: and when we &s;ee a very fooli&s;h <HI>fellow,</HI> we don't know what to think of <HI>him."</HI></Q> He then ro&s;e up, &s;trided to the fire, and &s;tood for &s;ome time laughing and exulting.</P>
<P>I told him that I had &s;everal times, when in Italy, &s;een the experiment of placing a &s;corpion within a circle of burning coals; that it ran round and round in extreme pain; and finding no way to e&s;cape, retired to the centre, and, like a true Stoick philo&s;opher, darted its &s;ting into its head, and thus at once freed it&s;elf from its woes. <Q REND="inline"><HI>"This mu&s;t end 'em."</HI></Q> I &s;aid, this was a curious fact, as it &s;hewed deliberate &s;uicide in a reptile. John&s;on would not admit the fact. He &s;aid, Maupertuis was of opinion that it does not kill it&s;elf, but dies of the heat; that it gets to the centre of the circle, as the coole&s;t place; that its turning its tail in upon its head is merely a convul&s;ion, and that it does not &s;ting it&s;elf. He &s;aid he would be &s;atisfied if the great anatomi&s;t Morgagni,
<PB N="302" REF="333" MS="y">
 after di&s;&s;ecting a &s;corpion upon whom the experiment had been tried, &s;hould certify that its &s;ting had penetrated into its head.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed plea&s;ed to talk of natural philo&s;ophy. <Q REND="inline">"That woodcocks, (&s;aid he,) fly over to the northern countries, is proved, becau&s;e they have been ob&s;erved at &s;ea. Swallows certainly &s;leep all the winter. A number of them conglobulate together, by flying round and round, and then all in a heap throw them&s;elves under water, and lye in the bed of a river."</Q> He told us, one of his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays was a Latin poem upon the glow-worm. I am &s;orry I did not a&s;k where it was to be found.</P>
<P>Talking of the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Chine&s;e, he advi&s;ed me to read Bell's travels. I a&s;ked him whether I &s;hould read Du Halde's account of China. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, (&s;aid he,) as one reads &s;uch a book; that is to &s;ay, con&s;ult it."</Q></P>
<P>He talked of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime of adultery, by which the peace of families was de&s;troyed. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Confu&s;ion of progeny con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of the crime; and therefore a woman who breaks her marriage vows is much more criminal than a man who does it. A man, to be &s;ure, is criminal in the &s;ight of GOD: but he does not do his wife a very material injury, if he does not in&s;ult her; if, for in&s;tance, from mere wantonne&s;s of appetite, he &s;teals privately to her chambermaid. Sir, a wife ought not greatly to re&s;ent this. I would not receive home a daughter who had run away from her hu&s;band on that account. A wife &s;hould &s;tudy to reclaim her hu&s;band by more attention to plea&s;e him. Sir, a man will not, once in a hundred in&s;tances, leave his wife and go to a harlot, if his wife has not been negligent of plea&s;ing."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him if it was not hard that one deviation from cha&s;tity &s;hould &s;o ab&s;o|lutely ruin a young woman. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; it is the great principle which &s;he is taught. When &s;he has given up that principle, &s;he has given up every notion of female honour and virtue, which are all included in cha&s;tity."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman talked to him of a lady whom he greatly admired and wi&s;hed to marry, but was afraid of her &s;uperiority of talents. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) you need not be afraid; marry her. Before a year goes about, you'll find that rea&s;on much weaker, and that wit not &s;o bright."</Q> Yet the gentleman may be ju&s;tified in his apprehen&s;ion by one of Dr. John&s;on's admirable &s;entences in his life of Waller: <Q REND="inline">"He doubtle&s;s prai&s;ed many whom he would have been afraid to marry; and, perhaps, married one whom he would have been a&s;hamed to prai&s;e. Many qualities contribute to dome&s;tick happine&s;s, upon which poetry has no colours to be&s;tow; and many airs and &s;allies may delight imagination, which he who flatters them never can approve."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="334">
He prai&s;ed Signor Baretti. <Q REND="inline">"His account of Italy is a very entertaining  book; and, Sir, I know no man who carries his head higher in conver&s;ation than Baretti. There are &s;trong powers in his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has he grapples very forcibly."</Q></P>
<P>At this time I ob&s;erved upon the dial-plate of his watch a &s;hort Greek in&s;cription, taken from the New Te&s;tament, <GAP DESC="foreign">, being the fir&s;t words of our Saviour's &s;olemn admonition to the improvement of that time which is allowed us to prepare for eternity; <Q REND="inline">"the night cometh when no man can work."</Q> He &s;ome time afterwards laid a&s;ide this dial-plate; and when I a&s;ked him the rea&s;on, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It might do very well upon a clock which a man keeps in his clo&s;et; but to have it upon his watch which he carries about with him, and which is often looked at by others, might be cen&s;ured as o&s;tentatious."</Q> Mr. Steevens is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the dial-plate in&s;cribed as above.</P>
<P>He remained at Oxford a con&s;iderable time; I was obliged to go to London, where I received his letter, which had been returned from Scotland.</P>

<P>I HAVE received your la&s;t letter, which, though very &s;hort, and by no means complimentary, yet gave me real plea&s;ure, becau&s;e it contains the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">'I &s;hall be glad, very glad to &s;ee you.'</Q>&mdash;Surely, you have no rea&s;on to complain of my publi&s;hing a &s;ingle paragragh of one of your letters;

<P>Upon his arrival in London in May, he &s;urprized me one morning with a vi&s;it at my lodgings in Half-Moon-&s;treet, was quite &s;atisfied with my expla|nation, and was in the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable frame of mind. As he had objected to a part of one of his letters being publi&s;hed, I thought it right to take this opportunity of a&s;king him explicitly whether it would be improper to publi&s;h his letters after his death. His an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, when I am dead, you may do as you will."</Q></P>
<P>He talked in his u&s;ual &s;tyle with a rough contempt of popular liberty. <Q REND="inline">"They make a rout about <HI>univer&s;al</HI> liberty, without con&s;idering that all that is to be valued, or indeed can be enjoyed by individuals, is <HI>private</HI> liberty. Political liberty is good only &s;o far as it produces private liberty. Now, Sir, there is the liberty of the pre&s;s, which you know is a con&s;tant topick. Sup|po&s;e you and I and two hundred more were re&s;trained from printing our thoughts: what then? What proportion would that re&s;traint upon us bear to the private happine&s;s of the nation?"</Q></P>
<P>This mode of repre&s;enting the inconveniencies of re&s;traint as light and in&s;ig|nificant, was a kind of &s;ophi&s;try in which he delighted to indulge him&s;elf, in oppo&s;ition to the extreme laxity for which it has been fa&s;hionable for too many to argue, when it is evident, upon reflection, that the very e&s;&s;ence of govern|ment is re&s;traint; and certain it is, that as government produces rational
<PB N="305" REF="336">
happine&s;s, too much re&s;traint is better than too little. But when re&s;traint is unnece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o clo&s;e as to gall tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to it, the people may and ought to remon&s;trate; and, if relief is not granted, to re&s;i&s;t. Of this manly and &s;pirited principle, no man was more convinced than John&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>About this time Dr. Kenrick attacked him, through my &s;ides, in a pam|phlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">"An Epi&s;tle to James Bo&s;well, E&s;q. occa&s;ioned by his having tran&s;mitted the moral Writings of Dr. Samuel John&s;on to Pa&s;cal Paoli, General of the Cor&s;icans."</Q> I was at fir&s;t inclined to an&s;wer this pamphlet; but John&s;on, who knew that my doing &s;o would only gratify Kenrick, by keeping alive what would &s;oon die away of it&s;elf, would not &s;uffer me to take any notice of it.</P>
<P>His &s;incere regard for Francis Barber, his faithful negro &s;ervant, made him &s;o de&s;irous of his further improvement, that he now placed him at a &s;chool at Bi&s;hop Stortford, in Hertford&s;hire. This humane attention does John&s;on's heart much honour. Out of many letters which Mr. Barber received from his ma&s;ter, he has pre&s;erved three, which he kindly gave me, and which I &s;hall in&s;ert according to their dates.</P>

<P>Soon afterwards, he &s;upped at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with a company whom I collected to meet him. They were Dr. Percy, now Bi&s;hop of Dromore, Dr. Douglas, now Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, Mr. Langton, Dr. Robert&s;on the Hi&s;torian, Dr. Hugh Blair, and Mr. Thomas Davies, who wi&s;hed much to be introduced to the&s;e eminent Scotch literati; but on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion he had very little opportunity of hearing them talk, for with an exce&s;s of prudence, for which John&s;on afterwards found fault with them, they hardly opened their lips, and that only to &s;ay &s;omething which they were
<PB N="306" REF="337" MS="y">
 certain would not expo&s;e them to the &s;word of Goliah; &s;uch was their anxiety for their fame when in the pre&s;ence of John&s;on. He was this evening in remarkable vigour of mind, and eager to exert him&s;elf in conver&s;ation, which he did with great readine&s;s and fluency; but I am &s;orry to find that I have pre&s;erved but a &s;mall part of what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He allowed high prai&s;e to Thom&s;on as a poet; but when one of the com|pany &s;aid he was al&s;o a very good man, our morali&s;t conte&s;ted this with great warmth, accu&s;ing him of gro&s;s &s;en&s;uality and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners. I was very much afraid that in writing Thom&s;on's life, Dr. John&s;on would have treated his private character with a &s;tern &s;everity, but I was agreeably di&s;|appointed; and I may claim a little merit in it, from my having been at pains to &s;end him authentick accounts of the affectionate and generous conduct of that poet to his &s;i&s;ters, one of whom, the wife of Mr. Thom&s;on, &s;chool|ma&s;ter at Lanark, I knew, and was pre&s;ented by her with three of his letters, one of which Dr. John&s;on has in&s;erted in his life.</P>
<P>He was vehement again&s;t old Dr. Moun&s;ey, of Chel&s;ea College, as <Q REND="inline">"a fellow who &s;wore and talked bawdy."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I have been often in his company, (&s;aid Dr. Percy,) and never heard him &s;wear or talk bawdy."</Q> Mr. Davies, who &s;at next to Dr. Percy, having after this had &s;ome conver&s;ation a&s;ide with him, made a di&s;covery which, in his zeal to pay court to Dr. John&s;on, he eagerly proclaimed aloud from the foot of the table: <Q REND="inline">"O, Sir, I have found out a very good rea&s;on why Dr. Percy never heard Moun&s;ey &s;wear or talk bawdy; for he tells me, he never &s;aw him but at the Duke of Northumberland's table."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"And &s;o, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on loudly, to Dr. Percy,) you would &s;hield this man from the charge of &s;wearing and talking bawdy, becau&s;e he did not do &s;o at the Duke of Northumberland's table. Sir, you might as well tell us that you had &s;een him hold up his hand at the Old Bailey, and he neither &s;wore nor talked bawdy; or that you had &s;een him in the cart at Tyburn, and he neither &s;wore nor talked bawdy. And is it thus, Sir, that you pre&s;ume to controvert what I have related?"</Q> Dr. John&s;on's animadver|&s;ion was uttered in &s;uch a manner, that Dr. Percy &s;eemed to be di&s;plea&s;ed, and &s;oon afterwards left the company, of which John&s;on did not at that time take any notice.</P>
<P>Swift having been mentioned, John&s;on, as u&s;ual, treated him with little re&s;pect as an authour. Some of us endeavoured to &s;upport the Dean of St. Patrick's, by various arguments. One in particular prai&s;ed his <Q REND="inline">"Conduct of the Allies."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, his 'Conduct of the Allies' is a performance of very little ability."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Surely, Sir, (&s;aid Dr. Douglas,) you mu&s;t allow it
<PB N="307" REF="338" MS="y">
has &s;trong facts."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but what is that to the merit  of the compo&s;ition? In the Se&s;&s;ions-paper of the Old Bailey there are &s;trong facts. Hou&s;ebreaking is a &s;trong fact; robbery is a &s;trong fact; and murder is a <HI>mighty</HI> &s;trong fact: but is great prai&s;e due to the hi&s;torian of tho&s;e &s;trong facts? No, Sir. Swift has told what he had to tell di&s;tinctly enough, but that is all. He had to count ten, and he has counted it right."</Q>&mdash;Then recol|lecting that Mr. Davies, by acting as an <HI>informer,</HI> had been the occa&s;ion of his talking &s;omewhat too har&s;hly to his friend Dr. Percy, for which, probably, when the fir&s;t ebullition was over, he felt &s;ome compunction, he took an oppor|tunity to give him a hit; &s;o added, with a preparatory laugh, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, Tom Davies might have written 'the Conduct of the Allies."</Q> Poor Tom being thus &s;uddenly dragged into ludicrous notice in pre&s;ence of the Scotti&s;h Doctors, to whom he was ambitious of appearing to advantage, was grievou&s;ly mortified. Nor did his puni&s;hment re&s;t here; for upon &s;ub&s;equent occa|&s;ions, whenever he, <Q REND="inline">"&s;tate&s;man all o'er,"</Q> a&s;&s;umed a &s;trutting importance, I u&s;ed to hail him&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"the Authour of the Conduct of the Allies."</HI></Q></P>
<P>When I called upon Dr. John&s;on next morning, I found him highly &s;ati&s;|fied with his colloquial prowe&s;s the preceding evening. <Q REND="inline">"Well, (&s;aid he,) we had good talk."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; you to&s;&s;ed and gored &s;everal per&s;ons."</Q></P>
<P>The late Alexander Earl of Eglintoune, who loved wit more than wine, and men of genius more than &s;ycophants, had a great admiration of John&s;on; but from the remarkable elegance of his own manners, was, perhaps, too delicately &s;en&s;ible of the roughne&s;s which &s;ometimes appeared in John&s;on's beha|viour. One evening about this time, when his Lord&s;hip did me the honour to &s;up at my lodgings with Dr. Robert&s;on and &s;everal other men of literary di&s;tinction, he regretted that John&s;on had not been educated with more refine|ment, and lived more in poli&s;hed &s;ociety. <Q REND="inline">"No, no, my Lord, (&s;aid Signor Baretti,) do with him what you would, he would always have been a bear."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"True, (an&s;wered the Earl, with a &s;mile,) but he would have been a <HI>dancing</HI> bear."</Q></P>
<P>To obviate all the reflections which have gone round the world to John&s;on's prejudice, by applying to him the epithet of a <HI>bear,</HI> let me impre&s;s upon my readers a ju&s;t and happy &s;aying of my friend Gold&s;mith, who knew him well: <Q REND="inline">"John&s;on, to be &s;ure, has a roughne&s;s in his manner; but no man alive has a more tender heart. <HI>He has nothing of the bear but his &s;kin."</HI></Q></P>

<P>I came to London in the autumn, and having informed him that I was going to be married in a few months, I wi&s;hed to have as much of his con|ver&s;ation as I could before engaging in a &s;tate of life which would probably keep me more in Scotland, and prevent my &s;eeing him &s;o often as when I was a &s;ingle man; but I found he was at Brighthelm&s;tone with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I was very &s;orry that I had not his company with me at the Jubilee, in honour of Shak&s;peare, at Stratford-upon-Avon, the great poet's native

town. John&s;on's connection both with Shak&s;peare and Garrick founded a  double claim to his pre&s;ence; and it would have been highly gratifying to Mr. Garrick. Upon this occa&s;ion I particularly lamented that he had not that warmth of friend&s;hip for his brilliant pupil, which we may &s;uppo&s;e would have had a benignant effect on both. When almo&s;t every man of eminence in the literary world was happy to partake in this fe&s;tival of genius, the ab&s;ence of John&s;on could not but be wondered at and regretted. The only trace of him there, was in the whim&s;ical adverti&s;ement of a haberda&s;her, who &s;old <HI>Shak&s;perian ribbands</HI> of various dyes; and, by way of illu&s;trating their appro|priation to the bard, introduced a line from the celebrated Prologue at the opening of Drury-lane theatre:
<Q><L>"Each change of <HI>many-colour'd</HI> life he drew."</L></Q></P>
<P>From Brighthelm&s;tone Dr. John&s;on wrote me the following letter, which they who may think that I ought to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t have le&s;s ardent feelings than I have always avowed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHY do you charge me with unkindne&s;s? I have omitted nothing that could do you good, or give you plea&s;ure, unle&s;s it be that I have forborne to tell you my opinion of your account of Cor&s;ica. I believe my opinion, if you think well of my judgement, might have given you plea|&s;ure; but when it is con&s;idered how much vanity is excited by prai&s;e, I am not &s;ure that it would have done you good. Your Hi&s;tory is like other hi&s;tories, but your Journal is in a very high degree curious and delightful. There is between the hi&s;tory and the journal that difference which there will always be found between notions borrowed from without, and notions gene|rated within. Your hi&s;tory was copied from books; your journal ro&s;e out of your own experience and ob&s;ervation. You expre&s;s images which operated &s;trongly upon your&s;elf, and you have impre&s;&s;ed them with great force upon your readers. I know not whether I could name any narrative by which curio&s;ity is better excited, or better gratified.</P>
<P>I am glad that you are going to be married; and as I wi&s;h you well in things of le&s;s importance, wi&s;h you well with proportionate ardour in this cri&s;is of your life. What I can contribute to your happine&s;s, I &s;hould be very unwilling to with-hold; for I have always loved and valued you, and &s;hall love
<PB N="310" REF="341">
 you and value you &s;till more, as you become more regular and u&s;eful: effects which a happy marriage will hardly fail to produce.</P>
<P>I do not find that I am likely to come back very &s;oon from this place. I &s;hall, perhaps, &s;tay a fortnight longer; and a fortnight is a long time to a lover ab&s;ent from his mi&s;tre&s;s. Would a fortnight ever have an end?</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After his return to town, we met frequently, and I continued the practice of making notes of his conver&s;ation, though not with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity as I wi&s;h I had done. At this time, indeed, I had a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for not being able to appropriate &s;o much time to my journal; for General Paoli, after Cor&s;ica had been overpowered by the monarchy of France, was now no longer at the head of his brave countrymen, but having with difficulty e&s;caped from his native i&s;land, had &s;ought an a&s;ylum in Great-Britain; and it was my duty, as well as my plea&s;ure, to attend much upon him. Such particulars of John&s;on's conver&s;ation at this period as I have committed to writing, I &s;hall here introduce, without any &s;trict attention to methodical arrangement. Some|times &s;hort notes of different days &s;hall be blended together, and &s;ometimes a day may &s;eem important enough to be &s;eparately di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he would not have Sunday kept with rigid &s;everity and gloom, but with a gravity and &s;implicity of behaviour.</P>
<P>I told him that David Hume had made a &s;hort collection of Scottici&s;ms. <Q REND="inline">"I wonder, (&s;aid John&s;on,) that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould find them."</Q></P>
<P>He would not admit the importance of the que&s;tion concerning the legality of general warrants. <Q REND="inline">"Such a power (he ob&s;erved,) mu&s;t be ve&s;ted in every government, to an&s;wer particular ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; and there can be no ju&s;t complaint but when it is abu&s;ed, for which tho&s;e who admini&s;ter government mu&s;t be an&s;werable. It is a matter of &s;uch indifference, a matter about which the people care &s;o very little, that were a man to be &s;ent over Britain to offer them an exemption from it at a halfpenny a piece, very few would purcha&s;e it."</Q> This was a &s;pecimen of that laxity of talking, which I have heard him fairly acknowledge; for, &s;urely, while the power of granting general warrants was &s;uppo&s;ed to be legal, and the apprehen&s;ion of them hung over our heads, we did not po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;ecurity of freedom, congenial to our
<PB N="311" REF="342" MS="y">
happy con&s;titution, and which, by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Wilkes, has been happily e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The duration of Parliament, whether for &s;even years or for the life of the King, appears to me &s;o immaterial, that I would not give half a crown to turn the &s;cale the one way or the other. The <HI>habeas corpus</HI> is the &s;ingle advantage which our government has over that of other countries."</Q></P>
<P>On the 30th of September we dined together at the Mitre. I attempted to argue for the &s;uperiour happine&s;s of the &s;avage life, upon the u&s;ual fanciful topicks. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there can be nothing more fal&s;e. The &s;avages have no bodily advantages beyond tho&s;e of civili&s;ed men. They have not better health; and as to care or mental unea&s;ine&s;s, they are not above it, but below it, like bears. No, Sir; you are not to talk &s;uch paradox: let me have no more of't. It cannot entertain, far le&s;s can it in&s;truct. Lord Monboddo, one of your Scotch Judges, talked a great deal of &s;uch non&s;en&s;e. I &s;uffered him; but I will not &s;uffer <HI>you."</HI></Q>&mdash;BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, does not Rou&s;&s;eau talk &s;uch non&s;en&s;e?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir; but Rou&s;&s;eau <HI>knows</HI> he is talking non&s;en&s;e, and laughs at the world for &s;taring at him."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a man who talks non&s;en&s;e &s;o well, mu&s;t know that he is talking non&s;en&s;e. But I am <HI>afraid,</HI> (chuckling and laughing,) Monboddo does <HI>not</HI> know that he is talking non&s;en&s;e <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">His Lord&s;hip having frequently &s;poken in an abu&s;ive manner of Dr. John&s;on, in my company, I on one occa&s;ion during the life-time of my illu&s;trious friend could not refrain from retaliation, and repeated to him this &s;aying.</NOTE>."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is it wrong then, Sir, to affect &s;ingularity, in order to make people &s;tare?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, if you do it by propagating errour: and, indeed, it is wrong in any way. There is in human nature a general inclination to make people &s;tare; and every wi&s;e man has him&s;elf to cure of it, and does cure him&s;elf. If you wi&s;h to make people &s;tare by doing better than others, why, make them &s;tare till they &s;tare their eyes out. But con&s;ider how ea&s;y it is to make people &s;tare, by being ab&s;urd. I may do it by going into a drawing-room without my &s;hoes. You remember the gentleman in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> who had a commi&s;|&s;ion of lunacy taken out again&s;t him for his extreme &s;ingularity, &s;uch as never wearing a wig, but a night-cap. Now, Sir, ab&s;tractedly, the night-cap was be&s;t; but, relatively, the advantage was overbalanced by his making the boys run after him."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a London life, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The happine&s;s of London is not to be conceived but by tho&s;e who have been in it. I will venture to &s;ay, there
<PB N="312" REF="343" MS="y">
 is more learning and &s;cience within the circumference of ten miles from where we now &s;it, than in all the re&s;t of the kingdom."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The only di&s;advantage is the great di&s;tance at which people live from one another."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but that is occa&s;ioned by the largene&s;s of it, which is the cau&s;e of all the other advantages."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sometimes I have been in the humour of wi&s;hing to retire to a de&s;art."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have de&s;art enough in Scotland."</Q></P>
<P>Although I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf a great deal of in&s;tructive conver&s;ation with him on the conduct of the married &s;tate, of which I had then a near pro&s;pect, he did not &s;ay much upon that topick. Mr. Seward heard him once &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"a man has a very bad chance for happine&s;s in that &s;tate, unle&s;s he marries a woman of very &s;trong and fixed principles of religion."</Q> He maintained to me, contrary to the common notion, that a woman would not be the wor&s;e wife for being learned; in which, from all that I have ob&s;erved of <HI>Artemi&s;ias,</HI> I humbly differed from him. That a woman &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible and well informed, I allow to be a great advantage; and think that Sir Thomas Over|bury <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"A Wife,"</Q> a poem, 1614.</NOTE>, in his rude ver&s;ification, has very judiciou&s;ly pointed out that degree of intelligence which is to be de&s;ired in a female companion:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Give me, next <HI>good,</HI> an <HI>under&s;tanding wife,</HI></L>
<L>"By Nature <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> not <HI>learned</HI> by much art;</L>
<L>"Some <HI>knowledge</HI> on her &s;ide will all my life</L>
<L>"More &s;cope of conver&s;ation impart;</L>
<L>"Be&s;ides, her inborne virtue fortifie;</L>
<L>"They are mo&s;t firmly good, who be&s;t know why."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>When I cen&s;ured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a &s;econd time, as it &s;hewed a di&s;regard of his fir&s;t wife, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Not at all, Sir. On the contrary, were he not to marry again, it might be concluded that his fir&s;t wife had given him a di&s;gu&s;t to marriage; but by taking a &s;econd wife he pays the highe&s;t compliment to the fir&s;t, by &s;hewing that &s;he made him &s;o happy as a married man, that he wi&s;hes to be &s;o a &s;econd time.&punc;</Q> So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate que&s;tion. And yet, on another occa&s;ion, he owned that he once had almo&s;t a&s;ked a promi&s;e of Mrs. John&s;on that &s;he would not marry again, but had checked him&s;elf. Indeed I cannot help thinking, that in his ca&s;e the reque&s;t would have been unrea&s;onable; for
<PB N="313" REF="344" MS="y">
if Mrs. John&s;on forgot, or thought it no injury to the memory of her fir&s;t  love,&mdash;the hu&s;band of her youth and the father of her children,&mdash;to make a &s;econd marriage, why &s;hould &s;he be precluded from a third, &s;hould &s;he be &s;o inclined? In John&s;on's per&s;evering fond appropriation of his <HI>Tetty,</HI> even after her decea&s;e, he &s;eems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the hone&s;t Birmingham trader. I pre&s;ume that her having been married before had, at times, given him &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; for I remember his ob&s;erving upon the marriage of one of our common friends, <Q REND="inline">"He has done a very fooli&s;h thing, Sir; he has married a widow, when he might have had a maid."</Q></P>
<P>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I had la&s;t year the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing Mrs. Thrale at Dr. John&s;on's one morning, and had conver&s;ation enough with her to admire her talents, and to &s;hew her that I was as John&s;onian as her&s;elf. Dr. John&s;on had probably been kind enough to &s;peak well of me, for this evening he delivered me a very polite card from Mr. Thrale and her, inviting me to Streatham.</P>
<P>On the 6th of October I complied with this obliging invitation, and found, at an elegant villa, &s;ix miles from town, every circum&s;tance that can make &s;ociety plea&s;ing. John&s;on, though quite at home, was yet looked up to with an awe, tempered by affection, and &s;eemed to be equally the care of his ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s. I rejoiced at &s;eeing him &s;o happy.</P>
<P>He played off his wit again&s;t Scotland with a good humoured plea&s;antry, which gave me, though no bigot to national prejudices, an opportunity for a little conte&s;t with him. I having &s;aid that England was obliged to us for gardeners, almo&s;t all their good gardeners being Scotchmen,&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is becau&s;e gardening is much more nece&s;&s;ary among&s;t you than with us, which makes &s;o many of your people learn it. It is <HI>all</HI> garden|ing with you. Things which grow wild here, mu&s;t be cultivated with great care in Scotland. Pray now, (throwing him&s;elf back in his chair, and laugh|ing,) are you ever able to bring the <HI>&s;loe</HI> to perfection?"</Q></P>
<P>I boa&s;ted that we had the honour of being the fir&s;t to aboli&s;h the unho&s;pitable, trouble&s;ome, and ungracious cu&s;tom of giving vails to &s;ervants. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you aboli&s;hed vails, becau&s;e you were too poor to be able to give them."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale di&s;puted with him on the merit of Prior. He attacked him powerfully; &s;aid, he wrote of love like a man who had never felt it: his love ver&s;es were college ver&s;es: and he repeated the &s;ong, <Q REND="inline">"Alexis &s;hunn'd his fellow &s;wains,"</Q> &amp;c. in &s;o ludicrous a manner, as to make us all wonder how any one could have been plea&s;ed with &s;uch fanta&s;tical &s;tuff. Mrs. Thrale &s;tood
<PB N="314" REF="345" MS="y">
 to her gun with great courage, in defence of amorous ditties which John&s;on de&s;pi&s;ed, till he at la&s;t &s;ilenced her by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Lady, talk no more of this. Non&s;en&s;e can be defended but by non&s;en&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale then prai&s;ed Garrick's talent for light gay poetry; and, as a &s;pecimen, repeated his &s;ong in <Q REND="inline">"Florizel and Perdita,"</Q> and dwelt with pecu|liar plea&s;ure on this line:
<Q><L>"I'd &s;mile with the &s;imple, and feed with the poor."</L></Q>
JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, my dear Lady, this will never do. Poor David! Smile with the &s;imple! What folly is that! And who would feed with the poor that can help it? No, no; let me &s;mile with the wi&s;e, and feed with the rich."</Q> I repeated this &s;ally to Garrick, and wondered to find his &s;en&s;ibility as a writer not a little irritated by it. To &s;ooth him, I ob&s;erved, that John&s;on &s;pared none of us; and I quoted the pa&s;&s;age in Horace, in which he com|pares one who attacks his friends for the &s;ake of a laugh, to a pu&s;hing ox that is marked by a bunch of hay put upon his horns: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"foenum habet in cornu."</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">"Aye, (&s;aid Garrick, vehemently,) he has a whole <HI>mow</HI> of it."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of hi&s;tory, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We may know hi&s;torical facts to be true, as we may know facts in common life to be true. Motives are generally unknown. We cannot tru&s;t to the characters we find in hi&s;tory, unle&s;s when they are drawn by tho&s;e who knew the per&s;ons; as tho&s;e, for in&s;tance, by Sallu&s;t and by Lord Clarendon."</Q></P>
<P>He would not allow much merit to Whitefield's oratory. <Q REND="inline">"His popularity, Sir, (&s;aid he,) is chiefly owing to the peculiarity of his manner. He would be followed by crowds were he to wear a night-cap in the pulpit, or were he to preach from a tree."</Q></P>
<P>I know not from what &s;pirit of contradiction he bur&s;t out into a violent declamation again&s;t the Cor&s;icans, of who&s;e heroi&s;m I talked in high terms. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) what is all this rout about the Cor&s;icans? They have been at war with the Genoe&s;e for upwards of twenty years, and have never yet taken their fortified towns. They might have battered down their walls and reduced them to powder in twenty years. They might have pulled the walls in pieces, and cracked the &s;tones with their teeth in twenty years."</Q> It was in vain to argue with him upon the want of artillery: he was not to be re&s;i&s;ted for the moment.</P>
<P>On the evening of October 10, I pre&s;ented Dr. John&s;on to General Paoli. I had greatly wi&s;hed that two men, for whom I had the highe&s;t e&s;teem, &s;hould
<PB N="315" REF="346" MS="y">
meet. They met with a manly ea&s;e, mutually con&s;cious of their own abili|ties,  and of the abilities of each other. The General &s;poke Italian, and Dr. John&s;on Engli&s;h, and under&s;tood one another very well, with a little aid of interpretation from me, in which I compared my&s;elf to an i&s;thmus which joins two great continents. Upon John&s;on's approach, the General &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"From what I have read of your works, Sir, and from what Mr. Bo&s;well has told me of you, I have long held you in great veneration."</Q> The General talked of languages being formed on the particular notions and manners of a people, without knowing which, we cannot know the language. We may know the direct &s;ignification of &s;ingle words; but by the&s;e no beauty of expre&s;&s;ion, no &s;ally of genius, no wit is conveyed to the mind. All this mu&s;t be by allu&s;ion to other ideas. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) you talk of language as if you had never done any thing el&s;e but &s;tudy it, in&s;tead of governing a nation."</Q> The General &s;aid, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Que&s;to e un troppo gran complimento,"</HI></Q> this is too great a com|pliment. John&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould have thought &s;o, Sir, if I had not heard you talk."</Q> The General a&s;ked him, what he thought of the &s;pirit of infidelity which was &s;o prevalent. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, this gloom of infidelity, I hope, is only a tran&s;ient cloud pa&s;&s;ing through the hemi&s;phere, which will &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated, and the &s;un break forth with his u&s;ual &s;plendour."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"You think then, (&s;aid the General,) that they will change their principles like their clothes."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, if they be&s;tow no more thought on prin|ciples than on dre&s;s, it mu&s;t be &s;o."</Q> The General &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"a great part of the fa&s;hionable infidelity was owing to a de&s;ire of &s;hewing courage. Men who have no opportunities of &s;hewing it as to things in this life, take death and futurity as objects on which to di&s;play it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is mighty fooli&s;h affectation. Fear is one of the pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, of which it is im|po&s;&s;ible to dive&s;t it. You remember that the Emperour Charles V. when he read upon the tomb-&s;tone of a Spani&s;h nobleman, 'Here lies one who never knew fear,' wittily &s;aid, 'Then he never &s;nuffed a candle with his fingers."</Q></P>
<P>He talked a few words of French to the General; but finding he did not do it with facility, he a&s;ked for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the following note:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"J'ai lu dans la geographie de Lucas de Linda un Pater-no&s;ter &ecirc;crit dans une langue tout&agrave;fait differente de l'Italienne, et de toutes autres le&s;quelles &s;e derivent du Latin. L'auteur l'appelle <HI>linguam Cor&s;icae ru&s;ticam;</HI> elle a peutetre pa&s;&s;&eacute;, peu a peu; mais elle a certainement prevalue autrefois dans les montagnes et dans la campagne. Le m&ecirc;me auteur dit la m&ecirc;me cho&s;e en parlant de Sardaigne; qu'il y a deux langues dans l'I&s;le, une des villes, l'autre de la campagne."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="347" MS="y">
 The General immediately informed him that the <HI>lingua ru&s;tica</HI> was only in Sardinia.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on went home with me, and drank tea till late in the night. He &s;aid, General Paoli had the loftie&s;t port of any man he had ever &s;een. He denied that military men were always the be&s;t bred men. Perfect good breeding, he ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ts in having no particular mark of any profe&s;&s;ion, but a general elegance of manners: whereas, in a military man, you can commonly di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>brand</HI> of a &s;oldier, <HI>l'homme d'epee.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;hunned to-night any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the perplexed que&s;tion of fate and free will, which I attempted to agitate: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) we <HI>know</HI> our will is free, and <HI>there's</HI> an end of't."</Q></P>
<P>He honoured me with his company at dinner on the 16th of October, at my lodgings in Old Bond-&s;treet, with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Bicker&s;taff, and Mr. Thomas Davies. Garrick played round him with a fond vivacity, taking hold of the brea&s;ts of his coat, and, looking up in his face with a lively archne&s;s, complimented him on the good health which he &s;eemed then to enjoy; while the &s;age, &s;haking his head, beheld him with a gentle complacency. One of the company not being come at the appointed hour, I propo&s;ed, as u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions, to order dinner to be &s;erved; adding, <Q REND="inline">"Ought &s;ix people to be kept waiting for one?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, (an&s;wered John&s;on, with a delicate huma|nity,) if the one will &s;uffer more by your &s;itting down, than the &s;ix will do by waiting."</Q> Gold&s;mith, to divert the tedious minutes, &s;trutted about, bragging of his dre&s;s, and I believe was &s;eriou&s;ly vain of it, for his mind was wonderfully prone to &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions. <Q REND="inline">"Come, come, (&s;aid Garrick,) talk no more of that. You are, perhaps, the wor&s;t&mdash;eheh!"</Q>&mdash;Gold&s;mith was eagerly attempting to interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing ironically, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, you will always <HI>look</HI> like a <HI>gentleman;</HI> but I am talking of being well or ill <HI>dre&s;t."</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, let me tell you, (&s;aid Gold&s;mith,) when my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he &s;aid 'Sir, I have a favour to beg of you. When any body a&s;ks you who made your clothes, be plea&s;ed to mention John Phielby, at the Harrow, in Water-lane."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that was becau&s;e he knew the &s;trange colour would attract crouds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and &s;ee how well he could make a coat even of &s;o ab&s;urd a colour."</Q></P>
<P>After dinner, our conver&s;ation fir&s;t turned upon Pope. John&s;on &s;aid, his characters of men were admirably drawn, tho&s;e of women not &s;o well. He repeated to us, in his forcible melodious manner, the concluding lines of the
<PB N="317" REF="348" MS="y">
Dunciad. While he was talking loudly in prai&s;e of tho&s;e lines, one of the  company ventured to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Too fine for &s;uch a poem:&mdash;a poem on what?"</Q> JOHNSON, (with a di&s;dainful look,) <Q REND="inline">"Why, on <HI>dunces.</HI> It was worth while being a dunce then. Ah, Sir, had&s;t <HI>thou</HI> lived in tho&s;e days! It is not worth while being a dunce now, when there are no wits."</Q> Bicker&s;taff ob&s;erved, as a peculiar circum&s;tance, that Pope's fame was higher when he was alive than it was then. John&s;on &s;aid, his Pa&s;torals were poor things, though the ver&s;ification was fine. He told us, with high &s;atisfaction, the anecdote of Pope's inquiring who was the author of his <Q REND="inline">"London,"</Q> and &s;aying he will be &s;oon <HI>deterr&eacute;.</HI> He ob&s;erved, that in Dryden's poetry there were pa&s;&s;ages drawn from a profundity which Pope could never reach. He repeated &s;ome fine lines on love, by the former, (which I have now forgotten,) and gave great applau&s;e to the character of Zimri. Gold&s;mith &s;aid, that Pope's character of Addi&s;on &s;hewed a deep knowledge of the human heart. John&s;on &s;aid, that the de&s;cription of the temple, in <Q REND="inline">"The Mourning Bride,"</Q> was the fine&s;t poetical pa&s;&s;age he had ever read; he recollected none in Shak&s;peare equal to it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But, (&s;aid Garrick, all alarmed for 'the god of his idolatry,') we know not the extent and variety of his powers. We are to &s;uppo&s;e there are &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in his works. Shak&s;peare mu&s;t not &s;uffer from the badne&s;s of our memories."</Q> John&s;on, diverted by this enthu&s;ia&s;tick jealou&s;y, went on with greater ardour: <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; Congreve has <HI>nature,"</HI></Q> (&s;miling on the tragick eagerne&s;s of Garrick;) but compo&s;ing him&s;elf, he added, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, this is not comparing Congreve on the whole, with Shak&s;peare on the whole; but only maintaining that Congreve has one finer pa&s;&s;age than any that can be found in Shak&s;peare. Sir, a man may have no more than ten guineas in the world, but he may have tho&s;e ten guineas in one piece; and &s;o may have a finer piece than a man who has ten thou&s;and pounds: but then he has only one ten-guinea piece.&mdash;What I mean is, that you can &s;hew me no pa&s;&s;age where there is &s;imply a de&s;cription of material objects, without any intermixture of moral notions, which produces &s;uch an effect."</Q> Mr. Murphy mentioned Shak&s;peare's de&s;cription of the night before the battle of Agincourt; but it was ob&s;erved, it had <HI>men</HI> in it. Mr. Davies &s;ugge&s;ted the &s;peech of Juliet, in which &s;he figures her&s;elf awaking in the tomb of her ance&s;tors. Some one mentioned the de&s;cription of Dover Cliff. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; it &s;hould be all preci|pice,&mdash;all vacuum. The crows impede your fall. The dimini&s;hed appear|ance of the boats, and other circum&s;tances, are all very good de&s;cription; but do not impre&s;s the mind at once with the horrible idea of immen&s;e height. The impre&s;&s;ion is divided; you pa&s;s on by computation, from one &s;tage of
<PB N="318" REF="349" MS="y">
 the tremendous &s;pace to another. Had the girl in <Q REND="inline">"The Mourning Bride"</Q> &s;aid, &s;he could not ca&s;t her &s;hoe to the top of one of the pillars in the temple, it would not have aided the idea, but weakened it."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a Barri&s;ter who had a bad utterance, &s;ome one, (to rou&s;e John&s;on,) wickedly &s;aid, that he was unfortunate in not having been taught oratory by Sheridan. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, if he had been taught by Sheridan, he would have cleared the room."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"Sheridan has too much vanity to be a good man."</Q> We &s;hall now &s;ee John&s;on's mode of <HI>defending</HI> a man; taking him into his own hands, and di&s;criminating. JOHNSON.</P>
<P><Q>No, Sir. There is, to be &s;ure, in Sheridan, &s;omething to reprehend, and every thing to laugh at; but, Sir, he is not a bad man. No, Sir; were mankind to be divided into good and bad, he would &s;tand con&s;iderably within the ranks of good. And, Sir, it mu&s;t be allowed that Sheridan excels in plain declamation, though he can exhibit no character."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould, perhaps, have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this di&s;qui&s;ition concerning a per&s;on of who&s;e merit and worth I think with re&s;pect, had he not attacked John&s;on &s;o outrageou&s;ly in his Life of Swift, and, at the &s;ame time, treated us his admi|rers as a &s;et of pigmies. He who has provoked the la&s;h of wit, cannot com|plain that he &s;marts from it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Montague, a lady di&s;tingui&s;hed for having written an E&s;&s;ay on Shak|&s;peare, being mentioned;&mdash;REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"I think that e&s;&s;ay does her honour."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; it does <HI>her</HI> honour, but it would do nobody el&s;e honour. I have, indeed, not read it all. But when I take up the end of a web, and find it packthread, I do not expect, by looking further, to find embroidery. Sir, I will venture to &s;ay, there is not one &s;entence of true critici&s;m in her book."</Q> GARRICK. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, &s;urely it &s;hews how much Voltaire has mi&s;taken Shak&s;peare, which nobody el&s;e has done."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, nobody el&s;e has thought it worth while. And what merit is there in that? You may as well prai&s;e a &s;choolma&s;ter for whipping a boy who has con&s;trued ill. No, Sir, there is no real critici&s;m in it; none &s;hewing the beauty of thought, as formed on the workings of the human heart."</Q></P>
<P>The admirers of this E&s;&s;ay<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Of whom I acknowledge my&s;elf to be one, con&s;idering it as a piece of the &s;econdary or com|parative &s;pecies of critici&s;m, and not of that profound &s;pecies which alone Dr. John&s;on would allow to be <Q REND="inline">"real critici&s;m."</Q> It is, be&s;ides, clearly and elegantly expre&s;&s;ed, and has done effectually what it profe&s;&s;ed to do, namely, vindicated Shak&s;peare from the mi&s;repre&s;entations of Voltaire; and con&s;idering how many young people were mi&s;led by his witty, though fal&s;e ob&s;ervations, Mrs. Montague's E&s;&s;ay was of &s;ervice to Shak&s;peare with a certain cla&s;s of readers, and is, therefore, entitled to prai&s;e. John&s;on, I am a&s;&s;ured, allowed the merit which I have &s;tated, &s;aying, (with reference to Voltaire,) <Q REND="inline">"it is conclu&s;ive <HI>ad hominem."</HI></Q></NOTE> may be offended at the &s;lighting manner in which John&s;on &s;poke of it; but let it be remembered, that he gave his hone&s;t
<PB N="319" REF="350" MS="y">
opinion, unbia&s;&s;ed by any prejudice, or any proud jealou&s;y of a woman  intruding her&s;elf into the chair of critici&s;m; for Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has told me, that when the E&s;&s;ay fir&s;t came out, and it was not known who had written it, John&s;on wondered how Sir Jo&s;hua could like it. At this time Sir Jo&s;hua him&s;elf had received no information concerning the authour, except being a&s;&s;ured by one of our mo&s;t eminent literati, that it was clear its authour did not know the Greek tragedies in the original. One day at Sir Jo&s;hua's table, when it was related that Mrs. Montague, in an exce&s;s of compliment to the authour of a modern tragedy, had exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I tremble for Shak&s;peare;"</Q> John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"When Shak&s;peare has got&mdash;for his rival, and Mrs. Montague for his defender, he is in a poor &s;tate indeed."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"The Scotchman has taken the right method in his 'Elements of Critici&s;m.' I do not mean that he has taught us any thing; but he has told us old things in a new way."</Q> MURPHY. <Q REND="inline">"He &s;eems to have read a great deal of French critici&s;m, and wants to make it his own; as if he had been for years anatomi&s;ing the heart of man, and peeping into every cranny of it."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"It is ea&s;ier to write that book, than to read it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We have an example of true critici&s;m in Burke's 'E&s;&s;ay on the Sublime and Beautiful;' and, if I recollect, there is al&s;o Du Bos; and Bouhours, who &s;hews all beauty to depend on truth. There is no great merit in telling how many plays have gho&s;ts in them, and how this gho&s;t is better than that. You mu&s;t &s;hew how terrour is impre&s;&s;ed on the human heart.&mdash;In the de&s;cription of night in Macbeth, the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkne&s;s,&mdash;in&s;pi&s;&s;ated gloom."</Q></P>
<P>Politicks being mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This petitioning is a new mode of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing government, and a mighty ea&s;y one. I will undertake to get peti|tions either again&s;t quarter guineas or half guineas, with the help of a little hot wine. There mu&s;t be no yielding to encourage this. The object is not important enough. We are not to blow up half a dozen palaces, becau&s;e one cottage is burning."</Q></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then took another turn. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is amazing what ignorance of certain points one &s;ometimes finds in men of eminence. A wit about town, who wrote Latin bawdy ver&s;es, a&s;ked me, how it happened that Eng|land and Scotland, which were once two kingdoms, were now one:&mdash;and Sir

 Fletcher Norton did not &s;eem to know that there were &s;uch publications as the Reviews."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The ballad of Hardyknute has no great merit, if it be really ancient. People talk of nature. But mere obvious nature may be exhibited with very little power of mind."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, October 19, I pa&s;&s;ed the evening with him at his hou&s;e. He advi&s;ed me to complete a Dictionary of words peculiar to Scotland, of which I &s;hewed him a &s;pecimen. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) Ray has made a collec|tion of north-country words. By collectiong tho&s;e of your country, you will do a u&s;eful thing towards the hi&s;tory of the language."</Q> He bade me al&s;o go on with collections which I was making upon the antiquities of Scotland. <Q REND="inline">"Make a large book; a folio."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But of what u&s;e will it be, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Never mind the u&s;e; do it."</Q></P>
<P>I complained that he had not mentioned Garrick in his Preface to Shak|&s;peare; and a&s;ked him if he did not admire him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, as a poor player, who frets and &s;truts his hour upon the &s;tage;&mdash;as a &s;hadow."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But has he not brought Shak&s;peare into notice?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, to allow that, would be to lampoon the age. Many of Shak&s;peare's plays are the wor&s;e for being acted: Macbeth, for in&s;tance."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, is nothing gained by decoration and action? Indeed, I do wi&s;h that you had mentioned Garrick."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, had I men|tioned him, I mu&s;t have mentioned many more: Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. Cibber,&mdash;nay, and Mr. Cibber too; he too altered Shak&s;peare."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You have read his apology, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, it is very entertain|ing. But as for Cibber him&s;elf, taking from his conver&s;ation all that he ought not to have &s;aid, he was a poor creature. I remember when he brought me one of his Odes to have my opinion of it, I could not bear &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, and would not let him read it to the end; &s;o little re&s;pect had I for <HI>that great man</HI> (laughing). Yet I remember Richard&s;on wondering that I could treat him with familiarity."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned to him that I had &s;een the execution of &s;everal convicts at Tyburn, two days before, and that none of them &s;eemed to be under any concern. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t of them, Sir, have never thought at all."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But is not the fear of death natural to man?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"So much &s;o, Sir, that the whole of life is but keeping away the thoughts of it."</Q> He then, in a low and earne&s;t tone, talked of his meditating upon the aweful hour of his-own di&s;&s;olution, and in what manner he &s;hould conduct him&s;elf upon that occa&s;ion: <Q REND="inline">"I know not (&s;aid he,) whether I &s;hould wi&s;h to have a friend by me, or have it all between GOD and my&s;elf."</Q></P>

Talking of our feeling for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why,  Sir, there is much noi&s;e made about it, but it is greatly exaggerated. No, Sir, we have a certain degree of feeling to prompt us to do good: more than that, Providence does not intend. It would be mi&s;ery to no purpo&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But &s;uppo&s;e now, Sir, that one of your intimate friends were apprehended for an offence for which he might be hanged."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould do what I could to bail him, and give him any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but if he were once fairly hanged, I &s;hould not &s;uffer."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Would you eat your dinner that day, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; and eat it as if he were eating it with me. Why, there's Baretti, who is to be tried for his life to-morrow, friends have ri&s;en up for him on every &s;ide; yet if he &s;hould be hanged, none of them will eat a &s;lice of plumb-pudding the le&s;s. Sir, that &s;ympathetick feeling goes a very little way in depre&s;&s;ing the mind."</Q></P>
<P>I told him that I had dined lately at Foote's, who &s;hewed me a letter to him from Tom Davies, telling him that he had not been able to &s;leep from the concern which he felt on account of <HI>this &s;ad affair of Baretti,</HI> begging of him to try if he could &s;ugge&s;t any thing that might be of &s;ervice to him; and at the &s;ame time recommending to him an indu&s;trious young man who kept a pickle-&s;hop. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, Sir, here you have a &s;pecimen of human &s;ympathy; a friend hanged, and a cucumber pickled. We know not whether Baretti or the pickle-man has kept Davies from &s;leep, nor does he know him&s;elf. And as to his not &s;leeping, Sir; Tom Davies is a very great man; Tom has been upon the &s;tage, and knows how to do tho&s;e things: I have not been upon the &s;tage, and cannot do tho&s;e things."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I have often blamed my&s;elf, Sir, for not feeling for others as &s;en&s;ibly as many &s;ay they do."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, don't be duped by them any more.

<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Foote has a great deal of humour?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"He has a &s;ingular talent of exhibiting character."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is not a talent, it is a vice; it is what others ab&s;tain from.

He looked grave and angry, and entered into a &s;erious refutation of the ju&s;tice of the remark. <Q REND="inline">"What, Sir, (&s;aid he,) talk thus of a man of liberal education;&mdash;a man who for years was at the Univer&s;ity of Oxford;&mdash;a man who has added &s;ixteen new characters to the Engli&s;h drama of his country!"</Q></NOTE>."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, he has thought &s;uperficially, and &s;eized the fir&s;t notions which occurred to his mind."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, &s;till he is like a dog, that &s;natches the piece next him. Did you never ob&s;erve that dogs have not the power of comparing? A dog will take a &s;mall bit of meat as readily as a large, when both are before him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Buchanan (he ob&s;erved,) has fewer <HI>centos</HI> than any modern Latin poet. He not only had great knowledge of the Latin language, but was a great poetical genius. Both the Scaligers prai&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P>He again talked of the pa&s;&s;age in Congreve with high commendation, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Shak&s;peare never has &s;ix lines together without a fault. Perhaps you may find &s;even: but this does not refute my general a&s;&s;ertion. If I come to an orchard, and &s;ay there's no fruit here, and then comes a poring man, who finds two apples and three pears, and tells me, 'Sir, you are mi&s;taken, I have found both apples and pears,' I &s;hould laugh at him: what would that be to the purpo&s;e?"</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What do you think of Dr. Young's 'Night Thoughts,' Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, there are very fine things in them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is there not le&s;s religion in the nation now, Sir, than there was formerly?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Sir, that there is."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"For in&s;tance, there u&s;ed to be a chaplain in every great family, which we do not find now."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Neither do you find many of the &s;tate &s;ervants which great families u&s;ed formerly to have. There is a change of modes in the whole department of life."</Q></P>
<P>Next day, October 20, he appeared, for the only time I &s;uppo&s;e in his life, as a witne&s;s in a Court of Ju&s;tice, being called to give evidence to the character of Mr. Baretti, who having &s;tabbed a man in the &s;treet, was arraigned
<PB N="323" REF="354">
at the Old Bailey for murder. Never did &s;uch a con&s;tellation of genius  enlighten the aweful Se&s;&s;ions Hou&s;e; Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Beau|clerk, and Dr. John&s;on: and undoubtedly their favourable te&s;timony had due weight with the Court and Jury. John&s;on gave his evidence in a &s;low, delibe|rate, and di&s;tinct manner, which was uncommonly impre&s;&s;ive. It is well known that Mr. Baretti was acquitted.</P>
<P>On the 26th of October, we dined together at the Mitre tavern. I found fault with Foote for indulging his talent of ridicule at the expence of his vi&s;itors, which I colloquially termed making fools of his company. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, when you go to &s;ee Foote, you do not go to &s;ee a &s;aint: you go to &s;ee a man who will be entertained at your hou&s;e, and then bring you on a publick &s;tage; who will entertain you at his hou&s;e, for the very purpo&s;e of bringing you on a publick &s;tage. Sir, he does not make fools of his company; they whom he expo&s;es are fools already: he only brings them into action."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of trade, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"It is a mi&s;taken notion that a va&s;t deal of money is brought into a nation by trade. It is not &s;o. Commodities come from commodities; but trade produces no capital acce&s;&s;ion of wealth. How|ever, though there &s;hould be little profit in money, there is a con&s;iderable profit in plea&s;ure, as it gives to one nation the productions of another; as we have wines and fruits, and many other foreign articles, brought to us."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, and there is a profit in plea&s;ure, by its furni&s;hing occu|pation to &s;uch numbers of mankind."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you cannot call that plea&s;ure to which all are aver&s;e, and which none begin but with the hope of leaving off; a thing which men di&s;like before they have tried it, and when they have tried it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, the mind mu&s;t be employed, and we grow weary when idle."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is, Sir, becau&s;e, others being bu&s;y, we want company; but if we were all idle, there would be no growing weary; we &s;hould all entertain one another. There is, indeed, this in trade:&mdash;it gives men an opportunity of improving their &s;ituation. If there were no trade, many who are poor would always remain poor. But no man loves labour for it&s;elf."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I know a per&s;on who does. He is a very laborious Judge, and he loves the labour."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that is becau&s;e he loves re&s;pect and di&s;tinction. Could he have them without labour, he would like it le&s;s."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"He tells me he likes it for it&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he fancies &s;o, becau&s;e he is not accu&s;tomed to ab&s;tract."</Q></P>
<P>We went home to his hou&s;e to tea. Mrs. Williams made it with &s;ufficient dexterity, notwith&s;tanding her blindne&s;s, though her manner of &s;atisfying
<PB N="324" REF="355" MS="y">
 her&s;elf that the cups were full enough, was a little aukward: &s;he put her finger down a certain way, till &s;he felt the tea touch it. In my fir&s;t elation at being allowed the privilege of attending Dr. John&s;on at his late vi&s;its to this lady, which was like being &egrave; <HI>&s;ecretioribus con&s;iliis,</HI> I willingly drank cup after cup, as if it had been the Heliconian &s;pring. But as the charm of novelty went off, I grew more fa&s;tidious; and be&s;ides, I di&s;covered that &s;he was of a peevi&s;h temper.</P>
<P>There was a pretty large circle this evening&punc; Dr. John&s;on was in very good humour, lively, and ready to talk upon all &s;ubjects. Mr. Fergu&s;&s;on, the &s;elf|taught philo&s;opher, told him of a new-invented machine which went without hor&s;es: a man who &s;at in it turned a handle, which worked a &s;pring that drove it forward. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) what is gained is, the man has his choice whether he will move him&s;elf alone, or him&s;elf and the machine too."</Q> Dominicetti being mentioned, he would not allow him any merit. <Q REND="inline">"There is nothing in all this boa&s;ted &s;y&s;tem. No, Sir; medicated baths can be no better than warm water: their only effect can be that of tepid moi&s;ture."</Q> One of the company took the other &s;ide, maintaining that medicines of various &s;orts, and &s;ome too of mo&s;t powerful effect, are introduced into the human frame by the medium of the pores; and, therefore, when warm water is impregnated with &s;alutiferous &s;ub&s;tances, it may produce great effects as a bath. This appeared to me very &s;atisfactory. John&s;on did not an&s;wer it; but talking for victory, and determined to be ma&s;ter of the field, he had recour&s;e to the device which Gold&s;mith imputed to him in the witty-words of one of Cibber's comedies: <Q REND="inline">"There is no arguing with John&s;on; for when his pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;es fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it."</Q> He turned to the gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, go to Dominicetti, and get thy&s;elf fumigated; but be &s;ure that the &s;team be directed to thy head, for <HI>that</HI> is the <HI>peccant part."</HI></Q> This produced a triumphant roar of laughter from the motley a&s;&s;embly of philo&s;ophers, printers, and dependents, male and female.</P>
<P>I know not how &s;o whim&s;ical a thought came into my mind, but I a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"If, Sir, you were &s;hut up in a ca&s;tle, and a new-born child with you, what would you do?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I &s;hould not much like my company."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But would you take the trouble of rearing it?"</Q> He &s;eemed, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, unwilling to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject; but upon my per&s;e|vering in my que&s;tion, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir, I would; but I mu&s;t have all conveniencies. If I had no garden, I would make a &s;hed on the roof, and take it there for fre&s;h air. I &s;hould feed it, and wa&s;h it much, and with warm water to plea&s;e it, not with cold water to give it pain."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But,
<PB N="325" REF="356">
Sir, does not heat relax?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are not to imagine the  water is to be very hot. I would not coddle the child. No, Sir, the hardy method of treating children does no good. I'll take you five children from London, who &s;hall cuff five Highland children. Sir, a man bred in London will carry a burthen, or run, or wre&s;tle, as well as a man brought up in the hardie&s;t manner in the country."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Good living, I &s;uppo&s;e, makes the Londoners &s;trong."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I don't know that it does. Our chairmen from Ireland, who are as &s;trong men as any, have been brought up upon potatoes. Quantity makes up for quality."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Would you teach this child that I have furni&s;hed you with, any thing?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, I &s;hould not be apt to teach it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Would not you have a plea&s;ure in teaching it?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have a plea&s;ure in teaching it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Have you not a plea&s;ure in teaching men?&mdash;<HI>There</HI> I have you. You have the &s;ame plea&s;ure in teaching men, that I &s;hould have in teaching children."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, &s;omething about that."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that what is called natural affection is born with us? It &s;eems to me to be the effect of habit, or of gratitude for kind|ne&s;s. No child has it for a parent whom it has not &s;een."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I think there is an in&s;tinctive natural affection in parents towards their children."</Q></P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia being mentioned as likely to become a great empire, by the rapid increa&s;e of population;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I &s;ee no pro&s;pect of their propagating more. They can have no more children than they can get. I know of no way to make them breed more than they do. It is not from rea|&s;on and prudence that people marry, but from inclination. A man is poor; he thinks, 'I cannot be wor&s;e, and &s;o I'll e'en take Peggy."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But have not nations been more populous at one period than another?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but that has been owing to the people being le&s;s thinned at one period than another, whether by emigrations, war, or pe&s;tilence, not by their being more or le&s;s prolifick. Births at all times bear the &s;ame proportion to the &s;ame number of people."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, to con&s;ider the &s;tate of our own country;&mdash;does not throwing a number of farms into one hand hurt population?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; the &s;ame quantity of food being produced, will be con&s;umed by the &s;ame number of mouths, though the people may be di&s;po&s;ed of in different ways. We &s;ee, if corn be dear, and butchers' meat cheap, the farmers all apply them&s;elves to the rai&s;ing of corn, till it becomes plentiful and cheap, and then butchers' meat becomes dear; &s;o that an equality is always pre&s;erved. No, Sir, let fanciful men do as
<PB N="326" REF="357" MS="y">
 they will, depend upon it, it is difficult to di&s;turb the &s;y&s;tem of life."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is it not a very bad thing for landlords to oppre&s;s their tenants, by rai&s;ing their rents?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Very bad. But, Sir, it never can have any general influence; it may di&s;tre&s;s &s;ome individuals. For con&s;ider this: landlords cannot do without tenants. Now tenants will not give more for land than land is worth. If they can make more of their money by keeping a &s;hop, or any other way, they'll do it, and &s;o oblige landlords to let land come back to a rea&s;onable rent, in order that they may get tenants. Land, in England, is an article of commerce. A tenant who pays his landlord his rent, thinks him&s;elf no more obliged to him than you think your&s;elf obliged to a man in who&s;e &s;hop you buy a piece of goods. He knows the landlord does not let him have his land for le&s;s than he can get from others, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;hopkeeper &s;ells his goods. No &s;hopkeeper &s;ells a yard of ribband for &s;ix-pence, when &s;even-pence is the current price."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is it not better that tenants &s;hould be dependent on landlords?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as there are many more tenants than landlords, per|haps, &s;trictly &s;peaking, we &s;hould wi&s;h not. But if you plea&s;e you may let your lands cheap, and &s;o get the value, part in money and part in homage. I &s;hould agree with you in that."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So, Sir, you laugh at &s;chemes of political improvement."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, mo&s;t &s;chemes of political improvement are very laughable things."</Q></P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Providence has wi&s;ely ordered that the more numerous men are, the more difficult it is for them to agree in any thing, and &s;o they are governed. There is no doubt, that if the poor &s;hould rea&s;on, 'We'll be the poor no longer, we'll make the rich take their turn,' they could ea&s;ily do it, were it not that they can't agree. So the common &s;oldiers, though &s;o much more numerous than their officers, are governed by them for the &s;ame rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mankind have a &s;trong attachment to the habitations to which they have been accu&s;tomed. You &s;ee the inhabitants of Norway do not with one con&s;ent quit it, and go to &s;ome part of America, where there is a mild climate, and where they may have the &s;ame produce from land, with the tenth part of the labour. No, Sir; their affection for their old dwellings, and the terrour of a general change, keep them at home. Thus, we &s;ee many of the fine&s;t &s;pots in the world thinly inhabited, and many rugged &s;pots well inhabited."</Q></P>
<P>The London Chronicle, which was the only new&s;paper he con&s;tantly took in, being brought, the office of reading it aloud was a&s;&s;igned to me. I was
<PB N="327" REF="358" MS="y">
diverted by his impatience. He made me pa&s;s over &s;o many parts of it, that  my ta&s;k was very ea&s;y. He would not &s;uffer one of the petitions to the King about the Middle&s;ex election to be read.</P>
<P>I had hired a Bohemian as my &s;ervant while I remained in London, and being much plea&s;ed with him, I a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on whether his being a Roman Catholick &s;hould prevent my taking him with me to Scotland. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir. If <HI>he</HI> has no objection, you can have none."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So, Sir, you are no great enemy to the Roman Catholick religion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No more, Sir, than to the Pre&s;byterian religion."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You are joking."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I really think &s;o. Nay, Sir, of the two, I prefer the Popi&s;h."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the Pre&s;byterians have no church, no apo&s;tolical ordination."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And do you think that ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as it was an apo&s;tolical in&s;titution, I think it is dangerous to be without it. And, Sir, the Pre&s;byterians have no publick wor&s;hip: they have no form of prayer in which they know they are to join. They go to hear a man pray, and are to judge whether they will join with him."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, their doctrine is the &s;ame with that of the Church of England. Their confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and the thirty-nine articles, contain the &s;ame points, even the doctrine of prede&s;tination."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; prede&s;ti|nation was a part of the clamour of the times, &s;o it is mentioned in our articles, but with as little po&s;itivene&s;s as could be."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Is it nece&s;|&s;ary, Sir, to believe all the thirty-nine articles?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is a que&s;tion which has been much agitated. Some have thought it nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould all be believed; others have con&s;idered them to be only articles of peace, that is to &s;ay, you are not to preach again&s;t them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It appears to me, Sir, that prede&s;tination, or what is equivalent to it, cannot be avoided, if we hold an univer&s;al pre&s;ence in the Deity."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, does not GOD every day &s;ee things going on without preventing them?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir; but if a thing be <HI>certainly</HI> fore|&s;een, it mu&s;t be fixed, and cannot happen otherwi&s;e; and if we apply this con&s;ideration to the human mind, there is no free will, nor do I &s;ee how prayer can be of any avail."</Q> He mentioned Dr. Clarke, and Bi&s;hop Bram|hall on Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity, and bid me read South's &s;ermons on Prayer; but avoided the que&s;tion which has excruciated philo&s;ophers and divines beyond any other. I did not pre&s;s it further, when I perceived that he was di&s;plea&s;ed, and &s;hrunk from any abridgement of an attribute u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the Divinity, however irreconcileable in its full extent with the grand &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="328" REF="359" MS="y">
 of moral government. His &s;uppo&s;ed orthodoxy here cramped the vigorous powers of his under&s;tanding. He was confined by a chain which early imagi|nation and long habit made him think ma&s;&s;y and &s;trong, but which, had he ventured to try, he could at once have &s;napt a&s;under.</P>
<P>I proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"What do you think, Sir, of Purgatory, as believed by the Roman Catholicks?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">Why, Sir, it is a very harmle&s;s doctrine. They are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither &s;o ob&s;tinately wicked as to de&s;erve everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, nor &s;o good as to merit being admitted into the &s;ociety of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits; and therefore that GOD is gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow of a middle &s;tate, where they may be purified by certain degrees of &s;uffering. You &s;ee, Sir, there is nothing unrea&s;onable in this."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But then, Sir, their ma&s;&s;es for the dead?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, if it be once e&s;tabli&s;hed that there are &s;ouls in purgatory, it is as proper to pray for <HI>them,</HI> as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The idolatry of the Ma&s;s?"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is no idolatry in the Ma&s;s. They believe GOD to be there, and they adore him."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The wor&s;hip of Saints?"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they do not wor&s;hip &s;aints; they invoke them; they only a&s;k their prayers. I am talking all this time of the <HI>doctrines</HI> of the church of Rome. I grant you that in <HI>practice,</HI> Purgatory is made a lucrative impo&s;ition, and that the people do become idolatrous as they recommend them&s;elves to the tutelary protection of par|ticular &s;aints. I think their giving the &s;acrament only in one kind is criminal, becau&s;e it is contrary to the expre&s;s in&s;titution of CHRIST, and I wonder how the Council of Trent admitted it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Confe&s;&s;ion?"</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, I don't know but that is a good thing. The &s;cripture &s;ays, 'Confe&s;s your faults one to another;' and the prie&s;ts confe&s;s as well as the laity. Then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that their ab&s;olution is only upon repentance, and often upon penance al&s;o. You think your &s;ins may be forgiven without penance, upon repentance alone."</Q></P>
<P>I thus ventured to mention all the common objections again&s;t the Roman Catholick Church, that I might hear &s;o great a man upon them. What he &s;aid is here accurately recorded. But it is not improbable that if one had taken the other &s;ide, he might have rea&s;oned differently.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however mention, that he had a re&s;pect for <Q REND="inline"><HI>"the old religion,"</HI></Q> as the mild Melancthon called that of the Roman Catholick Church, even while he was exerting him&s;elf for its reformation in &s;ome particulars. Sir William Scott informs me, that he heard John&s;on &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"A man who is converted from Prote&s;tanti&s;m to Popery, may be &s;incere: he parts with nothing: he is only &s;uperadding to what he already had. But a convert from Popery to
<PB N="329" REF="360" MS="y">
Prote&s;tanti&s;m, gives up &s;o much of what he has held as &s;acred as any thing  that he retains; there is &s;o much <HI>laceration of mind</HI> in &s;uch a conver&s;ion, that it can hardly be &s;incere and la&s;ting."</Q> The truth of this reflection may be con|firmed by many and eminent in&s;tances, &s;ome of which will occur to mo&s;t of my readers.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I introduced the &s;ubject of death, and endeavoured to maintain that the fear of it might be got over. I told him that David Hume &s;aid, he was no more unea&s;y to think he &s;hould <HI>not be</HI> after this life, than that he <HI>had not been</HI> before he began to exi&s;t. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if he really thinks &s;o, his perceptions are di&s;turbed; he is mad: if he does not think &s;o, he lies. He may tell you, he holds his finger in the flame of a candle, without feeling pain; would you believe him? When he dies, he at lea&s;t gives up all he has."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Foote, Sir, told me, that when he was very ill he was not afraid to die."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is not true, Sir. Hold a pi&s;tol to Foote's brea&s;t, or to Hume's brea&s;t, and threaten to kill them, and you'll &s;ee how they behave."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But may we not fortify our minds for the approach of death?"</Q>&mdash;Here I am &s;en&s;ible I was in the wrong, to bring before his view what he ever looked upon with horrour; for although when in a cele&s;tial frame, in his <Q REND="inline">"Vanity of human Wi&s;hes,"</Q> he has &s;uppo&s;ed death to be <Q REND="inline">"kind Nature's &s;ignal for retreat,"</Q> from this &s;tate of being to <Q REND="inline">"a hap|pier &s;eat,"</Q> his thoughts upon this aweful change were in general full of di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions. His mind re&s;embled the va&s;t amphitheatre, the Coli&s;aeum at Rome. In the centre &s;tood his judgement, which, like a mighty gladiator, combated tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions that, like the wild bea&s;ts of the <HI>Arena,</HI> were all around in cells, ready to be let out upon him. After a conflict, he drives them back into their dens; but not killing them, they were &s;till a&s;&s;ailing him. To my que&s;tion, whether we might not fortify our minds for the approach of death, he an&s;wered, in a pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, let it alone. It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it la&s;ts &s;o &s;hort a time."</Q> He added, (with an earne&s;t look,) <Q REND="inline">"A man knows it mu&s;t be &s;o, and &s;ubmits. It will do him no good to whine."</Q></P>
<P>I attempted to continue the conver&s;ation. He was &s;o provoked, that he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Give us no more of this;"</Q> and was thrown into &s;uch a &s;tate of agita|tion, that he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a way that alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me; &s;hewed an impatience that I &s;hould leave him, and when I was going away, called to me &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline">"Don't let us meet to-morrow."</Q></P>
<P>I went home exceedingly unea&s;y. All the har&s;h ob&s;ervations which I had ever heard made upon his character, crowded into my mind; and I &s;eemed
<PB N="330" REF="361" MS="y">
 to my&s;elf like the man who had put his head into the lion's mouth a great many times with perfect &s;afety, but at la&s;t had it bit off.</P>
<P>Next morning I &s;ent him a note, &s;tating, that I might have been in the wrong, but it was not intentionally; he was therefore, I could not help think|ing, too &s;evere upon me. That notwith&s;tanding our agreement not to meet that day, I would call on him in my way to the city, and &s;tay five minutes by my watch. <Q REND="inline">"You are, (&s;aid I,) in my mind, &s;ince la&s;t night, &s;urrounded with cloud and &s;torm. Let me have a glimp&s;e of &s;un&s;hine, and go about my affairs in &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Upon entering his &s;tudy, I was glad that he was not alone, which would have made our meeting more aukward. There were with him, Mr. Steevens and Mr. Tyers, both of whom I now &s;aw for the fir&s;t time. My note had, on his own reflection, &s;oftened him, for he received me very complacently; &s;o that I unexpectedly found my&s;elf at ea&s;e, and joined in the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, the criticks had done too much honour to Sir Richard Blackmore, by writing &s;o much again&s;t him. That in his <Q REND="inline">"Creation"</Q> he had been helped by various wits, a line by Philips and a line by Tickell; &s;o that by theiraid, and that of others, the poem had been made out. I defended Blackmore's lines, which have been ridiculed as ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e:
<Q><L>"A painted ve&s;t Prince Voltiger had on,</L>
<L>"Which from a naked Pict his grand&s;ire won."</L></Q>
I maintained it to be a poetical conceit. A Pict being painted, if he is &s;lain in battle, and a ve&s;t is made of his &s;kin, it is a painted ve&s;t won from him, though he was naked.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;poke unfavourably of a certain pretty voluminous authour, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He u&s;ed to write anonymous books, and then other books commending tho&s;e books, in which there was &s;omething of ra&s;cality."</Q></P>
<P>I whi&s;pered him, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, you are now in good humour."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir."</Q> I was going to leave him, and had got as far as the &s;tair-ca&s;e. He &s;topped me, and &s;miling, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Get you gone,"</Q> in a curious mode of inviting me to &s;tay, which I accordingly did for &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>This little incidental quarrel and reconciliation, which, perhaps, I may be thought to have detailed too minutely, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed as one of many proofs which his friends had, that though he might be charged with bad humour at times, he was always a good-natured man; and I have heard Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, a nice and delicate ob&s;erver of manners, particularly remark, that
<PB N="331" REF="362" MS="y">
when upon any occa&s;ion John&s;on had been rough to any per&s;on in company,  he took the fir&s;t opportunity of reconciliation, by drinking to him or addre&s;&s;|ing his di&s;cour&s;e to him; but if he found his dignified indirect overtures &s;ullenly neglected, he was quite indifferent, and con&s;idered him&s;elf as having done all that he ought to do, and the other as now in the wrong.</P>
<P>Being to &s;et out for Scotland on the 10th of November, I wrote to him at Streatham, begging that he would meet me in town on the 9th; but if this &s;hould be very inconvenient to him, I would go thither. His an&s;wer was as follows:

<DIV2 TYPE="year" N="1770">
<P><MILESTONE N="1770"> In 1770 he publi&s;hed a political pamphlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Fal&s;e Alarm,"</Q> intended to ju&s;tify the conduct of mini&s;try and their majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for having virtually a&s;&s;umed it as an axiom, that the expul&s;ion of a Member of Parliament was equivalent to exclu&s;ion, and thus having declared Colonel Lutterel to be duly elected for the county of Middle&s;ex, notwith&s;tanding Mr. Wilkes had a great majority of votes. This being ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a gro&s;s violation of the right of election, an alarm for the con&s;ti|tution extended it&s;elf all over the kingdom. To prove this alarm to be fal&s;e, was the purpo&s;e of John&s;on's pamphlet; but even his va&s;t powers were inadequate to cope with con&s;titutional truth and rea&s;on, and his argument failed of effect; and the Hou&s;e of Commons have &s;ince expunged the offen|&s;ive re&s;olution from their Journals. That the Hou&s;e of Commons might have expelled Mr. Wilkes repeatedly, and as often as he &s;hould be re-cho&s;en, was not denied; but incapacitation cannot be but by an act of the whole legi&s;lature. It was wonderful to &s;ee how a prejudice in favour of government in general, and an aver&s;ion to popular clamour, could blind and contract
<PB N="333" REF="364" MS="y">
&s;uch an under&s;tanding as John&s;on's, in this particular ca&s;e; yet the wit, the <MILESTONE N="1770. Aetat. 61."> &s;arca&s;m, the eloquent vivacity which this pamphlet di&s;played, made it be read with great avidity at the time, and it will ever be read with plea&s;ure, for the &s;ake of its compo&s;ition. That it endeavoured to infu&s;e a narcotick indifference, as to publick concerns, into the minds of the people, and that it broke out &s;ometimes into an extreme coar&s;ene&s;s of contemptuous abu&s;e, is but too evident.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not, however, be omitted, that when the &s;torm of his violence &s;ub|&s;ides, he takes a fair opportunity to pay a grateful compliment to the King, who had rewarded his merit: <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e low-born rulers have endeavoured, &s;urely without effect, to alienate the affections of the people from the only King who for almo&s;t a century has much appeared to de&s;ire, or much endeavoured to de&s;erve them."</Q> And, <Q REND="inline">"Every hone&s;t man mu&s;t lament, that the faction has been regarded with frigid neutrality by the Tories, who being long accu&s;|tomed to &s;ignali&s;e their principles by oppo&s;ition to the Court, do not yet con|&s;ider, that they have at la&s;t a King who knows not the name of party, and who wi&s;hes to be the common father of all his people."</Q></P>
<P>To this pamphlet, which was at once di&s;covered to be John&s;on's, &s;everal an&s;wers came out, in which, care was taken to remind the publick of his former attacks upon government, and of his now being a pen&s;ioner, without allowing for the honourable terms upon which John&s;on's pen&s;ion was granted and accepted, or the change of &s;y&s;tem which the Briti&s;h court had undergone upon the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. He was, however, &s;oothed in the highe&s;t &s;train of panegyrick, in a poem called <Q REND="inline">"The Remon&s;trance,"</Q> by the Reverend Mr. Stockdale, to whom he was, upon many occa&s;ions, a kind protector.</P>
<P>The following admirable minute made by him, de&s;cribes &s;o well his own &s;tate, and that of numbers to whom &s;elf-examination is habitual, that I cannot omit it:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"June 1, 1770. Every man naturally per&s;uades him&s;elf that he can keep his re&s;olutions, nor is he convinced of his imbecillity but by length of time and frequency of experiment. This opinion of our own con&s;tancy is &s;o preva|lent, that we always de&s;pi&s;e him who &s;uffers his general and &s;ettled purpo&s;e to be overpowered by an occa&s;ional de&s;ire. They, therefore, whom frequent failures have made de&s;perate, cea&s;e to form re&s;olutions; and they who are become cunning, do not tell them. Tho&s;e who do not make them are very few, but of their effect little is perceived; for &s;carcely any man per&s;i&s;ts in a cour&s;e of

</LETTER></P>
<P>During this year there was a total ce&s;&s;ation of all corre&s;pondence between Dr. John&s;on and me, without any coldne&s;s on either &s;ide, but merely from procra&s;tination, continued from day to day; and as I was not in London, I had no opportunity of enjoying his company and recording his conver&s;ation. To &s;upply this blank, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers with &s;ome <HI>Collectanea,</HI> obligingly furni&s;hed to me by the Reverend Dr. Maxwell, of Falkland, in Ireland, &s;ome time a&s;&s;i&s;tant preacher at the Temple, and for many years the &s;ocial friend of John&s;on, who &s;poke of him with a very kind regard.</P>
<Q><P>My acquaintance with that great and venerable character commenced in the year 1754. I was introduced to him by Mr. Grier&s;on <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Son of the learned Mrs. Grier&s;on, who was patroni&s;ed by the late Lord Granville, and was the editor of &s;everal of the cla&s;&s;icks.</NOTE>, his Maje&s;ty's printer at Dublin, a gentleman of uncommon learning, and great wit and vivacity. Mr. Grier&s;on died in Germany, at the age of twenty-&s;even. Dr. John&s;on highly re&s;pected his abilities, and often ob&s;erved, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more exten&s;ive knowledge than any man of his years he had ever known. His indu&s;try was equal to his talents; and he particularly excelled in every &s;pecies of philological learning, and was, perhaps, the be&s;t critick of the age he lived in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t always remember with gratitude my obligation to Mr. Grier&s;on, for the honour and happine&s;s of Dr. John&s;on's acquaintance and friend&s;hip, which continued uninterrupted and undimini&s;hed to his death: a connection, that was at once the pride and happine&s;s of my life.</P>
<P>What pity it is, that &s;o much wit and good &s;en&s;e as he continually exhibited in conver&s;ation, &s;hould peri&s;h unrecorded! Few per&s;ons quitted his
<PB N="337" REF="368" MS="y">
company without perceiving them&s;elves wi&s;er and better than they were  before. On &s;erious &s;ubjects he fla&s;hed the mo&s;t intere&s;ting conviction upon his auditors; and upon lighter topicks, you might have &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;<HI>Albano mu&s;as de monte locutas.</HI></P>
<P>Though I can hope to add but little to the celebrity of &s;o exalted a cha|racter, by any communications I can furni&s;h, yet out of pure re&s;pect to his memory, I will venture to tran&s;mit to you &s;ome anecdotes concerning him, which fell under my own ob&s;ervation. The very <HI>minutiae</HI> of &s;uch a character mu&s;t be intere&s;ting, and may be compared to the filings of diamonds.</P>
<P>In politicks he was deemed a Tory, but certainly was not &s;o in the obnoxious or party &s;en&s;e of the term; for while he a&s;&s;erted the legal and &s;alu|tary prerogatives of the crown, he no le&s;s re&s;pected the con&s;titutional liberties of the people. Whiggi&s;m, at the time of the Revolution, he &s;aid, was accom|panied with certain principles; but latterly, as a mere party di&s;tinction under Walpole and the Pelhams, was no better than the politicks of &s;tock-jobbers, and the religion of infidels.</P>
<P>He dete&s;ted the idea of governing by parliamentary corruption, and a&s;&s;erted mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly, that a prince &s;teadily and con&s;picuou&s;ly pur&s;uing the intere&s;ts of his people, could not fail of parliamentary concurrence. A prince of ability, he contended, might and &s;hould be the directing &s;oul and &s;pirit of his own admini&s;tration; in &s;hort, his own mini&s;ter, and not the mere head of a party: and then, and not till then, would the royal dignity be &s;incerely re&s;pected.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;eemed to think, that a certain degree of crown influence over the Hou&s;es of Parliament, (not meaning a corrupt and &s;hameful dependence,) was very &s;alutary, nay even nece&s;&s;ary, in our mixed government. <Q REND="inline">'For, (&s;aid he,) if the members were under no crown influence, and di&s;qualified from receiving any gratification from Court, and re&s;embled, as they po&s;&s;ibly might, Pym and Ha&s;lerig, and other &s;tubborn and &s;turdy members of the long Parliament, the wheels of government would be totally ob&s;tructed. Such men would oppo&s;e, merely to &s;hew their power, from envy, jealou&s;y, and perver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition; and not gaining them&s;elves, would hate and oppo&s;e all who did: not loving the per&s;on of the prince, and conceiving they owed him little gratitude, from the mere &s;pirit of in&s;olence and contradiction, they would oppo&s;e and thwart him upon all occa&s;ions.'</Q></P>
<P>The in&s;eparable imperfection annexed to all human governments, con&s;i&s;ted, he &s;aid, in not being able to create a &s;ufficient fund of virtue and principle to carry the laws into due and effectual execution. Wi&s;dom might plan, but
<PB N="338" REF="369" MS="y">
 virtue alone could execute. And where could &s;ufficient virtue be found? A variety of delegated, and often di&s;cretionary powers mu&s;t be entru&s;ted &s;ome|where; which, if not governed by integrity and con&s;cience, would nece&s;|&s;arily be abu&s;ed, till at la&s;t the con&s;table would &s;ell his for a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>This excellent per&s;on was &s;ometimes charged with abetting &s;lavi&s;h and arbitrary principles of government. Nothing in my opinion could be a gro&s;&s;er calumny and mi&s;repre&s;entation; for how can it be rationally &s;uppo&s;ed, that he &s;hould adopt &s;uch pernicious and ab&s;ured opinions, who &s;upported his philo|&s;ophical character with &s;o much dignity, was extremely jealous of his per&s;onal liberty and independence, and could not brook the &s;malle&s;t appearance of neglect or in&s;ult, even from the highe&s;t per&s;onages?</P>
<P>But let us view him in &s;ome in&s;tances of more familiar life.</P>
<P>His general mode of life, during my acquaintance, &s;eemed to be pretty uniform. About twelve o'clock I commonly vi&s;ited him, and frequently found him in bed, or declaiming over his tea, which he drank very plentifully. He generally had a levee of morning vi&s;itors, chiefly men of letters; Hawk&s;|worth, Gold&s;mith, Murphy, Langton, Steevens, Beauclerk, &amp;c. &amp;c. and &s;ometimes learned ladies, particularly I remember a French lady of wit and fa&s;hion doing him the honour of a vi&s;it. He &s;eemed to me to be con&s;idered as a kind of publick oracle, whom every body thought they had a right to vi&s;it and con&s;ult; and doubtle&s;s they were well rewarded. I never could di&s;|cover how he found time for his compo&s;itions. He declaimed all the morning, then went to dinner at a tavern, where he commonly &s;taid late, and then drank his tea at &s;ome friend's hou&s;e, over which he loitered a great while, but &s;eldom took &s;upper. I fancy he mu&s;t have read and wrote chiefly in the night, for I can &s;carely recollect that he ever refu&s;ed going with me to a tavern, and he often went to Ranelagh, which he deemed a place of innocent recreation.</P>
<P>He frequently gave all the &s;ilver in his pocket to the poor, who watched him, between his hou&s;e and the tavern where he dined. He walked the &s;treets at all hours, and &s;aid he was never robbed, for the rogues knew he had little money, nor had the appearance of having much.</P>
<P>Though the mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible and communicative man alive, yet when he &s;u&s;pected he was invited to be exhibited, he con&s;tantly &s;purned the invitation.</P>
<P>Two young women from Stafford&s;hire vi&s;ited him when I was pre&s;ent, to con&s;ult him on the &s;ubject of Methodi&s;m, to which they were inclined. <Q REND="inline">'Come, (&s;aid he,) you pretty fools, dine with Maxwell and me at the Mitre, and we will talk over that &s;ubject;'</Q> which they did, and after dinner he took one of them upon his knee, and fondled her for half an hour together.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="370" MS="y">
Upon a vi&s;it to me at a country lodging near Twickenham, he a&s;ked  what &s;ort of &s;ociety I had there.

<P>John&s;on was much attached to London: he ob&s;erved, that a man &s;tored his mind better there, than any where el&s;e; and that in remote &s;ituations a man's body might be fea&s;ted, but his mind was &s;tarved, and his faculties apt to degenerate, from want of exerci&s;e and competition. No place, he &s;aid, cured a man's vanity or arrogance, &s;o well as London; for as no man was either great or good <HI>per &s;e,</HI> but as compared with others not &s;o good or great, he was &s;ure to find in the metropolis many his equals, and &s;ome his &s;uperiours. He ob&s;erved, that a man in London was in le&s;s danger of fall|ing in love indi&s;creetly, than any where el&s;e; for there the difficulty of deciding between the conflicting preten&s;ions of a va&s;t variety of objects, kept him &s;afe. He told me, that he had frequently been offered country prefer|ment, if he would con&s;ent to take orders; but he could not leave the improved &s;ociety of the capital, or con&s;ent to exchange the exhilarating joys and &s;plendid decorations of publick life, for the ob&s;curity, in&s;ipidity, and uni|formity of remote &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Speaking of Mr. Harte, Canon of Wind&s;or, and writer of 'The Hi&s;tory of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,' he much commended him as a &s;cholar, and a man of the mo&s;t companionable talents he had ever known. He &s;aid, the defects in his hi&s;tory proceeded not from imbecillity, but from foppery.</P>
<P>He loved, he &s;aid, the old black letter books; they were rich in matter, though their &s;tyle was inelegant; wonderfully &s;o, con&s;idering how conver&s;ant the writer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were with the be&s;t models of antiquity.</P>
<P>Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' he &s;aid, was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours &s;ooner than he wi&s;hed to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>He frequently exhorted me to &s;et about writing a Hi&s;tory of Ireland, and archly remarked, there had been &s;ome good Iri&s;h writers, and that one Iri&s;h|man might at lea&s;t a&s;pire to be equal to another. He had great compa&s;&s;ion for the mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Iri&s;h nation, particularly the Papi&s;ts; and &s;everely reprobated the barbarous debilitating policy of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, which he &s;aid was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t dete&s;table mode of per&s;ecution.

 would it be to re&s;train the turbulence of the natives by the authority of the &s;word, and to make them amenable to law and ju&s;tice by an effectual and vigorous police, than to grind them to powder by all manner of di&s;abilities and incapacities.

<P>Dr. John&s;on was often accu&s;ed of prejudices, nay, antipathy, with regard to the natives of Scotland. Surely, &s;o illiberal a prejudice never entered his mind: and it is well known, many natives of that re&s;pectable country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare in his e&s;teem; nor were any of them ever excluded from his good offices, as far as opportunity permitted. True it is, he con&s;idered the Scotch, nationally, as a crafty, de&s;igning people, eagerly attentive to their own intere&s;t, and too apt to overlook the claims and preten&s;ions of other people. <Q REND="inline">'While they confine their benevolence, in a manner, exclu&s;ively to tho&s;e of their own country, they expect to &s;hare in the good offices of other people. Now (&s;aid John&s;on,) this principle is either right or wrong; if right, we &s;hould do well to imitate &s;uch conduct; if wrong, we cannot too much dete&s;t it.'</Q></P>
<P>Being &s;olicited to compo&s;e a funeral &s;ermon for the daughter of a trade&s;|man, he naturally enquired into the character of the decea&s;ed; and being told &s;he was remarkable for her humility and conde&s;cen&s;ion to inferiours, he ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e were very laudable qualities, but it might not be &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;cover who the lady's inferiours were.</P>
<P>Of a certain player he remarked, that his conver&s;ation u&s;ually threatened and announced more than it performed; that he fed you with a continual reno|vation of hope, to end in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>When exa&s;perated by contradiction, he was apt to treat his opponents with too much acrimony; as, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, you don't &s;ee your way through that que&s;tion:'&mdash;'Sir, you talk the language of ignorance.'</Q> On my ob&s;erving to him that a certain gentleman had remained &s;ilent the whole evening, in the mid&s;t of a very brilliant and learned &s;ociety, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, (&s;aid he,) the conver&s;ation overflowed and drowned him.'</Q></P>
<P>His philo&s;ophy, though au&s;tere and &s;olemn, was by no means moro&s;e and cynical, and never blunted the laudable &s;en&s;ibilities of his character, or exempted him from the influence of the tender pa&s;&s;ions. Want of tenderne&s;s, he always alledged, was want of parts, and was no le&s;s a proof of &s;tupidity than depravity.</P>

Speaking of Mr. Hanway, who publi&s;hed 'A Six Weeks Tour through  the South of England,' <Q REND="inline">'Jonas, (&s;aid he,) acquired &s;ome reputation by travel|ling abroad, but lo&s;t it all by travelling at home.'</Q></P>
<P>Of the pa&s;&s;ion of love he remarked, that its violence and ill effects were much exaggerated; for who has known any real &s;ufferings on that head, more than from the exorbitancy of any other pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>He much commended 'Law's Serious Call,' which he &s;aid was the fine&s;t piece of hortatory theology in any language. <Q REND="inline">'Law (&s;aid he,) fell latterly into the reveries of Jacob Behmen, whom Law alledged to have been &s;omewhat in the &s;ame &s;tate with St. Paul, and to have &s;een <HI>unutterable things.</HI> Were it even &s;o, (&s;aid John&s;on,) Jacob would have re&s;embled St. Paul &s;till more, by not attempting to utter them.'</Q></P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy in general did not preach plain enough; and that poli&s;hed periods and glittering &s;entences flew over the heads of the common people, without any impre&s;&s;ion upon their hearts. Something might be nece&s;&s;ary, he ob&s;erved, to excite the affections of the common people, who were &s;unk in languor and lethargy, and therefore he &s;uppo&s;ed that the new concomitants of methodi&s;m might probably produce &s;o de&s;irable an effect. The mind, like the body, he ob&s;erved, delighted in change and novelty, and even in religion it&s;elf, courted new appearances and modifica|tions. Whatever might be thought of &s;ome methodi&s;t teachers, he &s;aid, he could &s;carcely doubt the &s;incerity of that man, who travelled nine hundred miles in a month, and preached twelve times a week; for no adequate reward, merely temporal, could be given for &s;uch indefatigable labour.</P>
<P>Of Dr. Prie&s;tly's theological works, he remarked, that they tended to un&s;ettle every thing, and yet &s;ettled nothing.</P>
<P>He was much affected by the death of his mother, and wrote to me to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him to compo&s;e his mind, which indeed I found extremely agitated. He lamented that all &s;erious and religious conver&s;ation was bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of men, and yet great advantages might be derived from it. All acknowledged, he &s;aid, what hardly any body practi&s;ed, the obligation we were under of making the concerns of eternity the governing principles of our lives. Every man, he ob&s;erved, at la&s;t wi&s;hes for retreat: he &s;ees his expectations fru&s;trated in the world, and begins to wean him&s;elf from it, and to prepare for everla&s;ting &s;eparation.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that the influence of London now extended every where, and that from all manner of communication being opened, there &s;hortly would be no remains of the ancient &s;implicity, or places of cheap retreat to be found.</P>

 He was no admirer of blank-ver&s;e, and &s;aid it always failed, unle&s;s &s;u&s;|tained by the dignity of the &s;ubject.

<P>He reproved me once for &s;aying grace without mention of the name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and hoped in future I would be more mindful of the apo&s;tolical injunction.</P>
<P>He refu&s;ed to go out of a room before me at Mr. Langton's hou&s;e, &s;ay|ing, he hoped he knew his rank better than to pre&s;ume to take place of a Doctor in Divinity. I mention &s;uch little anecdotes, merely to &s;hew the peculiar turn and habit of his mind.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed frequently to ob&s;erve, that there was more to be endured than enjoyed, in the general condition of human life; and frequently quoted tho&s;e lines of Dryden:
<Q><L>'Strange cozenage! none would live pa&s;t years again,</L>
<L>'Yet all hope plea&s;ure from what &s;till remain.'</L></Q>
For his part, he &s;aid, he never pa&s;&s;ed that week in his life which he would wi&s;h to repeat, were an angel to make the propo&s;al to him.</P>
<P>He was of opinion, that the Engli&s;h nation cultivated both their &s;oil and their rea&s;on better than any other people; but admitted that the French, though not the highe&s;t, perhaps, in any department of literature, yet in every department were very high. Intellectual pre-eminence, he ob&s;erved, was the highe&s;t &s;uperiority; and that every nation derived their highe&s;t repu|tation from the &s;plendour and dignity of their writers. Voltaire, he &s;aid, was a good narrator, and that his principal merit con&s;i&s;ted in a happy &s;election and arrangement of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Speaking of the French novels, compared with Richard&s;on's, he &s;aid they might be pretty baubles, but a wren was not an eagle.</P>
<P>In a Latin conver&s;ation with the Pere Bo&s;covitz, at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Cholmondeley, I heard him maintain the &s;uperiority of Sir I&s;aac Newton over all foreign philo&s;ophers, with a dignity and eloquence that &s;urprized that learned foreigner. It being ob&s;erved to him, that a rage for every thing Engli&s;h prevailed much in France after Lord Chatham's glorious war, he &s;aid, he did not wonder at it, for that we had droubbed tho&s;e fellows into a proper reverence for us, and that their national petulance required periodical cha&s;|ti&s;ement.</P>

<P>John&s;on ob&s;erved, that &s;o many objections might be made to every thing, that nothing could overcome them but the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething. No man would be of any profe&s;&s;ion, as &s;imply oppo&s;ed to not being of it: but every one mu&s;t do &s;omething.</P>

It has been &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, with what truth I &s;hall not take upon me to decide, that he rated the con&s;equence of tho&s;e i&s;lands to Great-Britain too low. But however this may be, every humane mind mu&s;t &s;urely applaud the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he averted the cala|mity of war; a calamity &s;o dreadful, that it is a&s;toni&s;hing how civili&s;ed, nay, Chri&s;tian nations, can deliberately continue to renew it.

<MILESTONE N="1771.

With this view, he wrote a letter to one of the Secretaries of the Trea&s;ury, of which he gave me a copy in his own hand-writing, which is as follows:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will ea&s;ily recollect, when I had the honour of waiting upon you &s;ome time ago, I took the liberty to ob&s;erve to you, that Dr. John&s;on would make an excellent figure in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and heartily wi&s;hed he had a &s;eat there. My rea&s;ons are briefly the&s;e:</P>
<P>I know his perfect good affection to his Maje&s;ty, and his government, which I am certain he wi&s;hes to &s;upport by every means in his power.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great &s;hare of manly, nervous, and ready eloquence; is quick in di&s;cerning the &s;trength and weakne&s;s of an argument; can expre&s;s him&s;elf with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion, and fears the face of no man alive.</P>
<P>His known character, as a man of extraordinary &s;en&s;e and unimpeached virtue, would &s;ecure him the attention of the Hou&s;e, and could not fail to give him a proper weight there.</P>
<P>He is capable of the greate&s;t application, and can undergo any degree of labour, where he &s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary, and where his heart and affections are &s;trongly engaged. His Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters might therefore &s;ecurely depend on his doing, upon every proper occa&s;ion, the utmo&s;t that could be expected from him. They would find him ready to vindicate &s;uch mea&s;ures as tended to promote the &s;tability of government, and re&s;olute and &s;teady in carrying them into execution. Nor is any thing to be apprehended from the &s;uppo&s;ed impetuo&s;ity of his temper. To the friends of the King you will find him a lamb, to his enemies a lion.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I humbly apprehend that he would be a very able and u&s;eful member. And I will venture to &s;ay, the employment would not be di&s;agreeable to him; and knowing, as I do, his &s;trong affection to the King, his ability to &s;erve him in that capacity, and the extreme ardour with which I am convinced he would engage in that &s;ervice, I mu&s;t repeat, that I wi&s;h mo&s;t heartily to &s;ee him in the Hou&s;e.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>This recommendation we know was not effectual; but how, or for what rea&s;on, can only be conjectured. It is not to be believed that Mr. Strahan would have applied, unle&s;s John&s;on had approved of it. I never heard him mention the &s;ubject; but at a later period of his life, when Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds told him that Mr. Edmund Burke had &s;aid, that if he had come early into parliament, he certainly would have been the greate&s;t &s;peaker that ever was there, John&s;on exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould like to try my hand now."</Q></P>
<P>It has been much agitated among his friends and others, whether he would have been a powerful &s;peaker in Parliament, had he been brought in when advanced in life. I am inclined to think, that his exten&s;ive knowledge, his quickne&s;s and force of mind, his vivacity and richne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, his wit and humour, and above all his poignancy of &s;arca&s;m, would have had great effect in a popular a&s;&s;embly; and that the magnitude of his figure, and &s;triking peculiarity of his manner, would have aided the effect. But I remember it was ob&s;erved by Mr. Flood, that John&s;on having been long u&s;ed to &s;enten|tious brevity and the &s;hort flights of conver&s;ation, might have failed in that continued and expanded kind of argument, which is requi&s;ite in &s;tating com|plicated matters in publick &s;peaking; and as a proof of this he mentioned the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;peeches in Parliament written by him for the magazine, none of which, in his opinion, were at all like real debates. The opinion of one who is him&s;elf &s;o eminent an orator, mu&s;t be allowed to have great weight. It was confirmed by Sir William Scott, who mentioned, that John&s;on had told him, that he had &s;everal times tried to &s;peak in the Society of Arts and Sciences, but <Q REND="inline">"had found he could not get on."</Q> From Mr. William Gerard Hamilton I have heard, that John&s;on, when ob&s;erving to him that it was prudent for a man who had not been accu&s;tomed to &s;peak in publick to begin his &s;peech in as &s;imple a manner as po&s;&s;ible, acknowledged that he ro&s;e in that
<PB N="348" REF="379" MS="y">
 &s;ociety to deliver a &s;peech which he had prepared; <Q REND="inline">"but (&s;aid he,) all my flowers of oratory for&s;ook me."</Q> I however cannot help wi&s;hing, that he <HI>had</HI> <Q REND="inline">"tried his hand"</Q> in parliament; and I wonder that mini&s;try did not make the experiment.</P>

I wi&s;hed for your letter a long time, and when it came, it amply recompen&s;ed the delay.

He charges him|&s;elf with not ri&s;ing early enough; yet he mentions what was &s;urely a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for this, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a duty &s;eriou&s;ly required, as he all his life appears to have thought it. <Q REND="inline">"One great hindrance is want of re&s;t; my noc|turnal complaints grow le&s;s trouble&s;ome towards morning; and I am tempted to repair the deficiencies of the night <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 101.</NOTE>."</Q> Alas! how hard would it be if this indulgence were to be imputed to a &s;ick man as a crime.

<P>I am coming to London &s;oon, and am to appear in an appeal from the Court of Se&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Lords. A &s;choolma&s;ter in Scotland was, by a court of inferiour juri&s;diction, deprived of his office for being &s;omewhat &s;evere in the cha&s;ti&s;ement of his &s;cholars. The Court of Se&s;&s;ion con&s;idering it to be dangerous to the intere&s;t of learning and education to le&s;&s;en the dig|nity of teachers, and make them afraid of too indulgent parents, in&s;tigated by the complaints of their children, re&s;tored him. His enemies have appealed to the Hou&s;e of Lords, though the &s;alary is only twenty pounds a year. I was Coun&s;el for him here. I hope there will be little fear of a rever&s;al; but I mu&s;t beg to have your aid in my plan of &s;upporting the decree. It is a general que&s;tion, and not a point of particular law.</P>

<P>THAT you are coming &s;o &s;oon to town I am very glad; and &s;till more glad that you are coming as an advocate.

My kindne&s;s for you has neither the merit of &s;ingular virtue, nor the reproach of &s;ingular prejudice. Whether to love you be right or wrong, I have many on my &s;ide: Mrs. Thrale loves you, and Mrs. Williams loves you, and what would have inclined me to love you, if I had been neutral before, you are a great favourite of Dr. Beattie.</P>
<P>Of Dr. Beattie I &s;hould have thought much, but that his lady puts him out of my head: &s;he is a very lovely woman.</P>
<P>The ejection which you come hither to oppo&s;e, appears very cruel, un|rea&s;onable, and oppre&s;&s;ive. I &s;hould think there could not be much doubt of your &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

But however all this may be or not, let us try to make each other happy when we meet, and not refer our plea&s;ure to di&s;tant times or di&s;tant places.</P>

<P>On the 21&s;t of March, I was happy to find my&s;elf again in my friend's &s;tudy, and was glad to &s;ee my old acquaintance Mr. Francis Barber, who was now returned home. Dr. John&s;on received me with a hearty welcome, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I am glad you are come, and glad you are come upon &s;uch an errand,"</Q> (alluding to the cau&s;e of the &s;choolma&s;ter.) BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I hope, Sir, he will be in no danger. It is a very delicate matter to interfere between a ma&s;ter and his &s;cholars: nor do I &s;ee how you can fix the degree of &s;everity that a ma&s;ter may u&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, till you fix the degree of ob&s;tinacy and negligence of the &s;cholars, you cannot fix the degree of &s;everity of the ma&s;ter. Severity mu&s;t be continued until ob&s;tinacy be &s;ubdued, and negli|gence be cured."</Q> He mentioned the &s;everity of Hunter, his own ma&s;ter. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid I,) Hunter is a Scotch name: &s;o it &s;hould &s;eem this &s;choolma&s;ter who beat you &s;o &s;everely was a Scotchman. I can now account for your prejudice again&s;t the Scotch."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he was not Scotch; and, abating his brutality, he was a very good ma&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of his two political pamphlets, <Q REND="inline">"The Fal&s;e Alarm,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"Thoughts concerning Falkland's I&s;lands."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, which of them did you think the be&s;t?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I liked the &s;econd be&s;t."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I liked the fir&s;t be&s;t; and Beattie liked the fir&s;t be&s;t. Sir, there is a &s;ubtlety of di&s;qui&s;ition in the fir&s;t, that is worth all the fire of the &s;econd."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, is it true that Lord North paid you a vi&s;it, and that you got two hundred a year in addition to your pen&s;ion?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. Except what I had from the book&s;eller, I did not get a farthing by them. And, between you and me, I believe Lord North is no friend to me."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you cannot account for the fancies of men.&mdash;Well, how does Lord Elibank? and how does Lord Monboddo?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Very well, Sir. Lord Mon|boddo &s;till maintains the &s;uperiority of the &s;avage life."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"What &s;trange narrowne&s;s of mind now is that, to think the things we have not known are better than the things which we have known."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that is a common prejudice."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but a
<PB N="354" REF="385" MS="y">
 common prejudice &s;hould not be found in one who&s;e trade it is to rectify errour."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman having come in who was to go as a Mate in the &s;hip along with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked what were the names of the &s;hips de&s;tined for the expedition. The gentleman an&s;wered, they were once to be called the Drake and the Raleigh, but now they were to be called the Re&s;olution and the Adventure. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Much better; for had the Raleigh returned without going round the world, it would have been ridiculous. To give them the names of the Drake and the Raleigh was laying a trap for &s;atire."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Had not you &s;ome de&s;ire to go upon this expedition, Sir?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes; but I &s;oon laid it a&s;ide. Sir, there is very little of intellectual in the cour&s;e. Be&s;ides, I &s;ee but at a &s;mall di&s;tance. So it was not worth my while to go to &s;ee birds fly, which I &s;hould not have &s;een fly; and fi&s;hes &s;wim, which I &s;hould not have &s;een &s;wim."</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman being gone, and Dr. John&s;on having left the room for &s;ome time, a debate aro&s;e between the Reverend Mr. Stockdale and Mrs. De&s;mou|lins, whether Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were entitled to any &s;hare of glory from their expedition. When Dr. John&s;on returned to us, I told him the &s;ubject of their di&s;pute. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it was properly for botany that they went out: I believe they thought only of culling of &s;imples."</Q></P>
<P>I thanked him for &s;hewing civilities to Beattie. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) I &s;hould thank <HI>you.</HI> We all love Beattie. Mrs. Thrale &s;ays, if ever &s;he has another hu&s;band, &s;he'll have Beattie. He &s;unk upon us that he was married; el&s;e we &s;hould have &s;hewn his lady more civilities. She is a very fine woman. But how can you &s;hew civilities to a non-entity? I did not think he had been married. Nay, I did not think about it one way or other; but he did not tell us of his lady till late."</Q></P>
<P>He then &s;poke of St. Kilda, the mo&s;t remote of the Hebrides. I told him, I thought of buying it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Pray do, Sir. We &s;hall go and pa&s;s a winter amid the bla&s;ts there. We &s;hall have fine fi&s;h, and we &s;hall take &s;ome dried tongues with us, and &s;ome books. We &s;hall have a &s;trong built ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ome Orkney men to navigate her. We mu&s;t build a tolerable hou&s;e: but we may carry with us a wooden hou&s;e ready made, and requiring nothing but to be put up. Con&s;ider, Sir, by buying St. Kilda, you may keep the people from falling into wor&s;e hands. We mu&s;t give them a clergyman, and he &s;hall be one of Beattie's choo&s;ing. He &s;hall be educated at Mari&s;chal College. I'll be your Lord Chancellor, or what you plea&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;erious, Sir, in advi&s;ing me to buy St. Kilda? for if you &s;hould
<PB N="355" REF="386" MS="y">
advi&s;e me to go to Japan, I believe I &s;hould do it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes,  Sir, I am &s;erious."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why then I'll &s;ee what can be done."</Q></P>
<P>I gave him an account of the two parties in the church of Scotland, tho&s;e for &s;upporting the rights of patrons, independent of the people, and tho&s;e again&s;t it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It &s;hould be &s;ettled one way or other. I cannot wi&s;h well to a popular election of the clergy, when I con&s;ider that it occa&s;ions &s;uch animo&s;ities, &s;uch unworthy courting of the people, &s;uch &s;landers between the contending parties, and other di&s;advantages. It is enough to allow the people to remon&s;trate again&s;t the nomination of a mini&s;ter for &s;olid rea&s;ons;"</Q> (I &s;uppo&s;e he meant here&s;y or immorality.) He was engaged to dine abroad, and a&s;ked me to return to him in the evening at nine, which I accordingly did.</P>
<P>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams, who told us a &s;tory of &s;econd &s;ight, which happened in Wales where &s;he was born.&mdash;He li&s;tened to it very atten|tively, and &s;aid he &s;hould be glad to have &s;ome in&s;tances of that faculty well authenticated. His elevated wi&s;h for more and more evidence for &s;pirit, in oppo&s;ition to the groveling belief of materiali&s;m, led him to a love of &s;uch my&s;terious di&s;qui&s;itions. He again ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that we could have no certainty of the truth of &s;upernatural appearances, unle&s;s &s;omething was told us which we could not know by ordinary means, or &s;omething done which could not be done but by &s;upernatural power; that Pharaoh in rea&s;on and ju&s;tice required &s;uch evidence from Mo&s;es; nay, that our Saviour &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had &s;in."</Q> He had &s;aid in the morning, that <Q REND="inline">"Macaulay's Hi&s;tory of St. Kilda,"</Q> was very well written, except &s;ome foppery about liberty and &s;lavery. I mentioned to him that Macaulay told me, he was advi&s;ed to leave out of his book the wonderful &s;tory that upon the approach of a &s;tranger all the inhabitants catch cold; but that it had been &s;o well authenticated, he determined to retain it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, to leave things out of a book, merely becau&s;e people tell you they will not be believed, is meanne&s;s. Macaulay acted with more magnanimity."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the Roman Catholick religion, and how little difference there was in e&s;&s;ential matters between ours and it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"True, Sir: all denominations of Chri&s;tians have really little difference in point of doctrine, though they may differ widely in external forms. There is a prodigious dif|ference between the external form of one of your Pre&s;byterian churches in Scotland, and a church in Italy; yet the doctrine taught is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned the petition to Parliament for removing the &s;ub&s;cription to the Thirty-nine Articles. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It was &s;oon thrown out. Sir, they talk
<PB N="356" REF="387" MS="y">
 of not making boys at the Univer&s;ity &s;ub&s;cribe to what they do not under|&s;tand; but they ought to con&s;ider, that our Univer&s;ities were founded to bring up members for the Church of England, and we mu&s;t not &s;upply our enemies with arms from our ar&s;enal. No, Sir, the meaning of &s;ub&s;cribing is, not that they fully under&s;tand all the articles, but that they will adhere to the Church of England. Now take it in this way, and &s;uppo&s;e that they &s;hould only &s;ub|&s;cribe their adherence to the Church of England, there would be &s;till the &s;ame difficulty; for &s;till the young men would be &s;ub&s;cribing to what they do not under&s;tand. For if you &s;hould a&s;k them, what do you mean by the Church of England? Do you know in what it differs from the Pre&s;byterian Church? from the Romi&s;h Church? from the Greek Church? from the Coptick Church? they could not tell you. So, Sir, it comes to the &s;ame thing."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, would it not be &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;cribe the Bible?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; for all &s;ects will &s;ub&s;cribe the Bible; nay, the Mahometans will &s;ub&s;cribe the Bible, for the Mahometans acknowledge JESUS CHRIST, as well as Mo&s;es, but maintain that GOD &s;ent Mahomet as a &s;till greater prophet than either."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned the motion to aboli&s;h the fa&s;t of the 30th of January. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I could have wi&s;hed that it had been a temporary act, perhaps, to have expired with the century. I am again&s;t aboli&s;hing it; becau&s;e that would be declaring it was wrong to e&s;tabli&s;h it; but I &s;hould have no objec|tion to make an act, continuing it for another century, and then letting it expire."</Q></P>
<P>He di&s;approved of the Royal Marriage Bill; <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e (&s;aid he,) I would not have the people think that the validity of marriage depends on the will of man, or that the right of a King depends on the will of man. I &s;hould not have been again&s;t making the marriage of any of the royal family, without the approbation of King and Parliament, highly criminal."</Q></P>
<P>In the morning we had talked of old families, and the re&s;pect due to them. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have a right to that kind of re&s;pect, and are arguing for your&s;elf. I am for &s;upporting the principle, and am di&s;intere&s;ted in doing it, as I have no &s;uch right."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is one more incitement to a man to do well."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, and it is a matter of opinion, very nece&s;&s;ary to keep &s;ociety together. What is it but opinion, by which we have a re&s;pect for authority, that prevents us, who are the rabble, from ri&s;ing up and pulling down you who are gentlemen from your places, and &s;aying, 'We will be gentlemen in our turn?' Now, Sir, that re&s;pect for authority is much more ea&s;ily granted to a man who&s;e father has had it, than to an up&s;tart, and &s;o Society is more ea&s;ily &s;upported."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, it might be
<PB N="357" REF="388" MS="y">
done by the re&s;pect belonging to office, as among the Romans, where the dre&s;s,  the <HI>toga,</HI> in&s;pired reverence."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, we know very little about the Romans. But, &s;urely, it is much ea&s;ier to re&s;pect a man who has always had re&s;pect, than to re&s;pect a man who we know was la&s;t year no better than our&s;elves, and will be no better next year. In republicks there is not a re&s;pect for authority, but a fear of power."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"At pre&s;ent, Sir, I think riches &s;eem to gain mo&s;t re&s;pect."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, riches do not gain hearty re&s;pect; they only procure external attention. A very rich man, from low beginnings, may buy his election in a borough; but, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> a man of family will be preferred. People will prefer a man for who&s;e father their fathers have voted, though they &s;hould get no more money, or even le&s;s. That &s;hews that the re&s;pect for family is not merely fanciful, but has an actual operation. If gentlemen of family would allow the rich up&s;tarts to &s;pend their money profu&s;ely, which they are ready enough to do, and not vie with them in expence, the up&s;tarts would &s;oon be at an end, and the gentle|men would remain: but if the gentlemen will vie in expence with the up&s;tarts, which is very fooli&s;h, they mu&s;t be ruined."</Q></P>
<P>I gave him an account of the excellent mimickry of a friend of mine in Scotland; ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that &s;ome people thought it a very mean thing. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is making a very mean u&s;e of a man's powers. But to be a good mimick, requires great powers, great acutene&s;s of ob&s;ervation, great retention of what is ob&s;erved, and great pliancy of organs, to repre&s;ent what is ob&s;erved. I remember a lady of quality in this town, Lady&mdash;, who was a wonderful mimick, and u&s;ed to make me laugh immoderately. I have heard &s;he is now gone mad."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It is amazing how a mimick can not only give you the ge&s;tures and voice of a per&s;on whom he repre&s;ents; but even what a per&s;on would &s;ay on any parti|cular &s;ubject."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to con&s;ider that the manner and &s;ome particular phra&s;es of a per&s;on do much to impre&s;s you with an idea of him, and you are not &s;ure that he would &s;ay what the mimick &s;ays in his character."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't think Foote a good mimick, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; his imitations are not like. He gives you &s;omething different from him&s;elf, but not the character which he means to a&s;&s;ume. He goes out of him&s;elf without going into other people. He cannot take off any per&s;on unle&s;s he is very &s;trongly marked, &s;uch as George Faulkner. He is like a painter, who can draw the portrait of a man who has a wen upon his face, and who, therefore, is ea&s;ily known. If a man hops upon one leg, Foote can hop upon one leg. But he has not that nice di&s;crimination which
<PB N="358" REF="389" MS="y">
 your friend &s;eems to po&s;&s;es. Foote is, however, very entertaining, with a kind of conver&s;ation between wit and buffoonery."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, March 23, I found him bu&s;y, preparing a fourth edition of his folio Dictionary. Mr. Peyton, one of his original amanuen&s;es, was writing for him. I put him in mind of a meaning of the word <HI>&s;ide,</HI> which he had omitted, viz. relation&s;hip; as, father's &s;ide, mother's &s;ide. He in&s;erted it. I a&s;ked him if <HI>humiliating</HI> was a good word. He &s;aid, he had &s;een it frequently u&s;ed, but he did not know it to be legitimate Engli&s;h. He would not admit <HI>civilization,</HI> but only <HI>civility.</HI> With great deference to him, I thought <HI>civili|zation,</HI> from <HI>to civilize,</HI> better in the &s;en&s;e oppo&s;ed to <HI>barbarity,</HI> than <HI>civility,</HI> as it is better to have a di&s;tinct word for each &s;en&s;e, than one word with two &s;en&s;es, which <HI>civility</HI> is, in his way of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed bu&s;y about &s;ome &s;ort of chymical operation. I was entertained by ob&s;erving how he contrived to &s;end Mr. Peyton on an errand, without &s;eeming to degrade him. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Peyton,&mdash;Mr. Peyton,&mdash;will you be &s;o good as to take a walk to Temple-bar? You will there &s;ee a chymi&s;t's &s;hop; at which you will be plea&s;ed to buy for me an ounce of oil of vitriol; not &s;pirit of vitriol, but oil of vitriol. It will co&s;t three half-pence."</Q> Peyton im|mediately went, and returned with it, and told him it co&s;t but a penny.</P>
<P>I then reminded him of the &s;choolma&s;ter's cau&s;e, and propo&s;ed to read to him the printed papers concerning it. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, (&s;aid he,) I can read quicker than I can hear."</Q> So he read them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After he had read for &s;ome time, we were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Kri&s;trom, a Swede, who was tutor to &s;ome young gentlemen in the city. He told me, that there was a very good Hi&s;tory of Sweden, by Daline. Having at that time an intention of writing the hi&s;tory of that country, I a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on whether one might write a hi&s;tory of Sweden without going thither. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (&s;aid he,) one for common u&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of languages. John&s;on ob&s;erved, that Leibnitz had made &s;ome progre&s;s in a work, tracing all languages up to the Hebrew. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) you would not imagine that the French <HI>jour,</HI> day, is derived from the Latin <HI>dies,</HI> and yet nothing is more certain; and the intermediate &s;teps are very clear. From <HI>dies,</HI> comes <HI>diurnus. Diu</HI> is, by inaccurate cars or inaccu|rate pronunciation, ea&s;ily confounded with <HI>giu;</HI> then the Italians form a &s;ub|&s;tantive of the ablative of an adjective, and thence <HI>giurno,</HI> or, as they make it, <HI>giorno;</HI> which is readily contracted into <HI>giour,</HI> or <HI>jour."</HI></Q> He ob&s;erved, that the Bohemian language was true Sclavonick. The Swede &s;aid, it had &s;ome
<PB N="359" REF="390">
&s;imilarity with the German. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, to be &s;ure, &s;uch parts  of Sclavonia as confine with Germany, will borrow German words; and &s;uch parts as confine with Tartary, will borrow Tartar words."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, he never had it properly a&s;certained that the Scotch Highlanders and the Iri&s;h under&s;tood each other. I told him that my cou&s;in Colonel Graham, of the Royal Highlanders, whom I met at Drogheda, told me they did. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if the Highlanders under&s;tood Iri&s;h, why tran&s;late the New Te&s;tament into Er&s;e, as was done lately at Edinburgh, when there is an Iri&s;h tran&s;lation?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Although the Er&s;e and Iri&s;h are both dialects of the &s;ame language, there may be a good deal of diver&s;ity between them, as between the different dialects in Italy.</Q>&mdash;The Swede went away, and Mr. John&s;on continued his reading of the papers. I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid, Sir, it is trouble&s;ome to you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid he,) I do not take much delight in it; but I'll go through it."</Q></P>
<P>We went to the Mitre, and dined in the room where he and I fir&s;t &s;upped together. He gave me great hopes of my cau&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) the government of a &s;choolma&s;ter is &s;omewhat of the nature of military govern|ment; that is to &s;ay, it mu&s;t be arbitrary, it mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed by the will of one man, according to particular circum&s;tances. You mu&s;t &s;hew &s;ome learn|ing upon this occa&s;ion. You mu&s;t &s;hew, that a &s;choolma&s;ter has a pre&s;criptive right to beat; and that an action of a&s;&s;ault and battery cannot be admitted again&s;t him, unle&s;s there is &s;ome great exce&s;s, &s;ome barbarity. This man has maimed none of his boys. They are all left with the full exerci&s;e of their corporeal faculties. In our &s;chools in England, many boys have been maimed; yet I never heard of an action again&s;t a &s;choolma&s;ter on that account. Puffendorf, I think, maintains the right of a &s;choolma&s;ter to beat his &s;cholars."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, March 27, I introduced to him Sir Alexander Macdonald, with whom he had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to be acquainted. He received him very courteou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Sir Alexander ob&s;erved, that the Chancellors in England are cho&s;en from views much inferiour to the office, being cho&s;en from temporary political views. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, in &s;uch a government as ours, no man is appointed to an office becau&s;e he is the fitte&s;t for it, nor hardly in any other govern|ment; becau&s;e there are &s;o many connections and dependencies to be &s;tudied. A de&s;potick prince may choo&s;e a man to an office, merely becau&s;e he is the fitte&s;t for it. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia may do it."</Q> SIR A. <Q REND="inline">"I think, Sir, almo&s;t all great lawyers, &s;uch at lea&s;t as have written upon law, have known only law, and
<PB N="360" REF="391">
 nothing el&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir; Judge Hale was a great lawyer, and wrote upon law; and yet he knew a great many other things, and has written upon other things. Selden too."</Q> SIR A. <Q REND="inline">"Very true, Sir; and Lord Bacon. But was not Lord Coke a mere lawyer?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, I am afraid he was; but he would have taken it very ill if you had told him &s;o. He would have pro&s;ecuted you for &s;candal."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Lord Mansfield is not a mere lawyer."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. I never was in Lord Mansfield's company; but, Lord Mansfield was di&s;tingui&s;hed at the Univer&s;ity. Lord Mansfield, when he came fir&s;t to town, 'drank champagne with the wits,' as Prior &s;ays. He was the friend of Pope."</Q> SIR. A. <Q REND="inline">"Barri&s;ters, I believe, are not &s;o abu&s;ive now as they were formerly. I fancy they had le&s;s law long ago, and &s;o were obliged to take to abu&s;e, to fill up the time. Now they have &s;uch a number of precedents, they have no occa&s;ion for abu&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, they had more law long ago than they have now. As to pre|cedents, to be &s;ure they will increa&s;e in cour&s;e of time; but the more prece|dents there are, the le&s;s occa&s;ion is there for law; that is to &s;ay, the le&s;s occa&s;ion is there for inve&s;tigating principles."</Q> SIR A. <Q REND="inline">"I have been cor|recting &s;everal Scotch accents in my friend Bo&s;well. I doubt, Sir, if any Scotchman ever attains to a perfect Engli&s;h pronunciation."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, few of them do, becau&s;e they do not per&s;evere after acquiring a certain degree of it. But, Sir, there can be no doubt that they may attain to a perfect Engli&s;h pronunciation, if they will. We find how near they come to it; and certainly, a man who conquers nineteen parts of the Scotti&s;h accent, may conquer the twentieth. But, Sir, when a man has got the better of nine tenths, he grows weary, he relaxes his diligence, he finds he has corrected his accent &s;o far as not to be di&s;agreeable, and he no longer de&s;ires his friends to tell him when he is wrong; nor does he choo&s;e to be told. Sir, when people watch me narrowly, and I do not watch my&s;elf, they will find me out to be of a particular county. In the &s;ame manner, Dunning may be found out to be a Devon&s;hire man. So mo&s;t Scotchmen may be found out. But, Sir, little aberrations are of no di&s;advantage. I never catched Mallet in a Scotch accent; and yet Mallet, I &s;uppo&s;e, was pa&s;t five-and-twenty before he came to London."</Q></P>
<P>Upon another occa&s;ion I talked to him on this &s;ubject, having my&s;elf taken &s;ome pains to improve my pronunciation, by the aid of the late Mr. Love, of Drury-lane theatre, when he was a player at Edinburgh, and al&s;o of old Mr. Sheridan. John&s;on &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, your pronunciation is not offen&s;ive."</Q>
<PB N="361" REF="392">
With this conce&s;&s;ion I was pretty well &s;atisfied; and let me give my country|men  of North-Britain an advice not to aim at ab&s;olute perfection in this re&s;pect; not to &s;peak <HI>High Engli&s;h,</HI> as we are apt to call what is far removed from the <HI>Scotch,</HI> but which is by no means good Engli&s;h, and makes <Q REND="inline">"the fools who u&s;e it,"</Q> truly ridiculous. Good Engli&s;h is plain, ea&s;y, and &s;mooth in the mouth of an unaffected Engli&s;h gentleman. A &s;tudied and factitious pronun|ciation, which requires perpetual attention, and impo&s;es perpetual con&s;traint, is exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ting. A &s;mall intermixture of provincial peculiarities may, perhaps, have an agreeable effect, as the notes of different birds concur in the harmony of the grove, and plea&s;e more than if they were all exactly alike. I could name &s;ome gentlemen of Ireland, to whom a &s;light proportion of the accent and recitative of that country is an advantage. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation will apply to the gentlemen of Scotland. I do not mean that we &s;hould &s;peak as broad as a certain pro&s;perous member of parliament from that country; though it has been well ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"it has been of no &s;mall u&s;e to him; as it rou&s;es the attention of the Hou&s;e by its uncommonne&s;s; and is equal to tropes and figures in a good Engli&s;h &s;peaker."</Q> I would give as an in&s;tance of what I mean to recommend to my countrymen, the pronunciation of the late Sir Gilbert Elliot; and may I pre&s;ume to add that of the pre&s;ent Earl of Marchmont, who told me, with great good humour, that the ma&s;ter of a &s;hop in London, where he was not known, &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you are an American."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why &s;o, Sir,"</Q> (&s;aid his Lord&s;hip.) <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, Sir, (replied the &s;hopkeeper,) you &s;peak neither Engli&s;h nor Scotch, but &s;omething different from both, which I conclude is the language of America."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"It may be of u&s;e, Sir, to have a Dictionary to a&s;certain the pronunciation."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, my Dictionary &s;hews you the accents of words, if you can but remember them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, we want marks to a&s;certain the pronunciation of the vowels. Sheridan, I believe, has fini&s;hed &s;uch a work."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, con&s;ider how much ea&s;ier it is to learn a language by the ear, than by any marks. Sheridan's Dictionary may do very well; but you cannot always carry it about with you: and, when you want the word, you have not the Dictionary. It is like a man who has a &s;word that will not draw. It is an admirable &s;word, to be &s;ure: but while your enemy is cutting your throat, you are unable to u&s;e it. Be&s;ides, Sir, what entitles Sheridan to fix the pronunciation of Engli&s;h? He has, in the fir&s;t place, the di&s;advantage of being an Iri&s;hman: and if he &s;ays he will
<PB N="362" REF="393" MS="y">
 fix it after the example of the be&s;t company, why they differ among them|&s;elves. I remember an in&s;tance: when I publi&s;hed the Plan for my Dictionary, Lord Che&s;terfield told me that the word <HI>great</HI> &s;hould be pronounced &s;o as to rhyme to <HI>&s;tate;</HI> and Sir William Young &s;ent me word that it &s;hould be pro|nounced &s;o as to rhyme to <HI>&s;eat,</HI> and that none but an Iri&s;hman would pronounce it <HI>grait.</HI> Now here were two men of the highe&s;t rank, the one, the be&s;t &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the other, the be&s;t &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e of Commons, differing entirely."</Q></P>
<P>I again vi&s;ited him at night. Finding him in a very good humour, I ven|tured to lead him to the &s;ubject of our &s;ituation in a future &s;tate, having much curio&s;ity to know his notions on that point. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, the hap|pine&s;s of an unembodied &s;pirit will con&s;i&s;t in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the favour of GOD, in the contemplation of truth, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of felicitating ideas."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is there any harm in our forming to our&s;elves conjec|tures as to the particulars of our happine&s;s, though the &s;cripture has &s;aid but very little on the &s;ubject? 'We know not what we &s;hall be."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, there is no harm. What philo&s;ophy &s;ugge&s;ts to us on this topick is probable: what &s;cripture tells us is certain. Dr. Henry More has carried it as far as philo&s;ophy can. You may buy both his theological and philo&s;ophical works in two volumes folio, for about eight &s;hillings."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"One of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing thoughts is, that we &s;hall &s;ee our friends again."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that when we are become purely rational, many of our friend&s;hips will be cut off. Many friend&s;hips are formed by a community of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures: all the&s;e will be cut off. We form many friend&s;hips with bad men, becau&s;e they have agreeable qualities, and they can be u&s;eful to us; but, after death, they can no longer be of u&s;e to us. We form many friend&s;hips by mi&s;take, imagining people to be different from what they really are. After death, we &s;hall &s;ee every one in a true light. Then, Sir, they talk of our meeting our relations: but then all relation&s;hip is di&s;|&s;olved; and we &s;hall have no regard for one per&s;on more than another, but for their real value. However, we &s;hall either have the &s;atisfaction of meeting our friends, or be &s;atisfied without meeting them."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yet, Sir, we &s;ee in &s;cripture that Dives &s;till retained an anxious concern about his brethren."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, we mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e that pa&s;&s;age to be metapho|rical, or hold with many divines, and all the Purgatorians, that departed &s;ouls do not all at once arrive at the utmo&s;t perfection of which they are capable."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I think, Sir, that is a very rational &s;uppo&s;ition."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but we do not know it is a true one. There is no harm in
<PB N="363" REF="394" MS="y">
believing it: but you mu&s;t not compel others to make it an article of faith,  for it is not revealed."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do you think, Sir, it is wrong in a man who holds the doctrine of purgatory, to pray for the &s;ouls of his decea&s;ed friends?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I have been told, that in the liturgy of the Epi&s;copal Church of Scotland, there was a form of prayer for the dead."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is not in the liturgy which Laud framed for the Epi&s;copal Church of Scotland: if there is a liturgy older than that, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"As to our employment in a future &s;tate, the &s;acred writings &s;ay little. The Revelation, however, of St. John gives us many ideas, and particularly mentions mu&s;ick."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, ideas mu&s;t be given you by means of &s;omething which you know: and as to mu&s;ick, there are &s;ome philo&s;ophers and divines who have maintained that we &s;hall not be &s;pirituali&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, but that &s;ome|thing of matter, very much refined, will remain. In that ca&s;e, mu&s;ick may make a part of our future felicity."</Q></P>
<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I do not know whether there are any well-atte&s;ted &s;tories of the appearance of gho&s;ts. You know there is a famous &s;tory of the appearance of Mrs. Veal, prefixed to 'Drelincourt on Death."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, that is given up. I believe the woman declared upon her death-bed that it was a lie."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"This objection is made again&s;t the truth of gho&s;ts appearing: that if they are in a &s;tate of happine&s;s, it would be a puni&s;hment to them to return to this world; and if they are in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, it would be giving them a re&s;pite."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of unembodied &s;pirits does not depend upon place, but is intellectual, we cannot &s;ay that they are le&s;s happy or le&s;s mi&s;erable by appearing upon earth."</Q></P>
<P>We went down between twelve and one to Mrs. William's room, and drank tea. I mentioned that we were to have the remains of Mr. Gray, in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, publi&s;hed by Mr. Ma&s;on. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think we have had enough of Gray. I &s;ee they have publi&s;hed a &s;plendid edition of Aken&s;ide's works. One bad Ode may be &s;uffered, but a number of them together makes one &s;ick."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Aken&s;ide's di&s;tingui&s;hed poem is his 'Plea&s;ures of the Imagination:' but, for my part, I never could admire it &s;o much as mo&s;t people do."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I could not read it through."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I have read it through; but I did not find any great power in it."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Elwal, the heretick, who&s;e trial Sir John Pringle had given me to read. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Mr. Elwal was, I think, an ironmonger at Wolverhampton; and he had a mind to make him&s;elf famous, by being the

 founder of a new &s;ect, which he wi&s;hed much &s;hould be called <HI>Elwallians.</HI> He held, that every thing in the Old Te&s;tament that was not typical, was to be of perpetual ob&s;ervance; and &s;o he wore a ribband in the plaits of his coat, and he al&s;o wore a beard. I remember I had the honour of dining in company with Mr. Elwal. There was one Barter, a miller, who wrote again&s;t him; and &s;o you had 'The Controver&s;y between Mr. ELWAL and Mr. BARTER.' To try to make him&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;hed, he wrote a letter to King George the Second, challenging him to di&s;pute with him, in which he &s;aid, 'George, if you be afraid to come by your&s;elf, to di&s;pute with a poor old man, you may bring a thou&s;and of your <HI>black</HI>-guards with you; and if you &s;hould &s;till be afraid, you may bring a thou&s;and of your <HI>red</HI>-guards.' The letter had &s;omething of the impudence of Junius to our pre&s;ent King. But the men of Wolverhampton were not &s;o inflammable as the Common Council of London; &s;o Mr. Elwal failed in his &s;cheme of making him&s;elf a man of great con&s;equence."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, March 31, he and I dined at General Paoli's. A que&s;tion was &s;tarted, whether the &s;tate of marriage was natural to man. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is &s;o far from being natural for a man and woman to live in a &s;tate of marriage, that we find all the motives which they have for remaining in that connection, and the re&s;traints which civili&s;ed &s;ociety impo&s;es to prevent &s;eparation, are hardly &s;ufficient to keep them together."</Q> The General &s;aid, that in a &s;tate of nature a man and woman uniting together would form a &s;trong and con&s;tant affection, by the mutual plea&s;ure each would receive; and that the &s;ame cau&s;es of di&s;&s;ention would not ari&s;e between them, as occur between hu&s;band and wife in a civili&s;ed &s;tate. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they would have di&s;&s;en|tions enough, though of another kind. One would choo&s;e to go a hunting in this wood, the other in that; one would choo&s;e to go a fi&s;hing in this lake, the other in that; or, perhaps, one would choo&s;e to go a hunting, when the other would choo&s;e to go a fi&s;hing; and &s;o they would part. Be&s;ides, Sir, a &s;avage man and a &s;avage woman meet by chance; and when the man &s;ees another woman that plea&s;es him better, he will leave the fir&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>We then fell into a di&s;qui&s;ition whether there is any beauty independent of utility. The General maintained there was not. Dr. John&s;on maintained that there was; and he in&s;tanced a coffee-cup which he held in his hand, the painting of which was of no real u&s;e, as the cup would hold the coffee equally well if plain; yet the painting was beautiful.</P>
<P>We talked of the &s;trange cu&s;tom of &s;wearing in conver&s;ation. The Genera &s;aid, that all barbarous nations &s;wore from a certain violence of temper, that
<PB N="365" REF="396" MS="y">
could not be confined to earth, but was always reaching at the powers  above. He &s;aid, too, that there was greater variety of &s;wearing, in propor|tion as there was a greater variety of religious ceremonies.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on went home with me to my lodgings in Conduit-&s;treet and drank tea, previous to our going to the Pantheon, which neither of us had &s;een before.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Gold&s;mith's Life of Parnell is poor; not that it is poorly written, but that he had poor materials: for nobody can write the life of a man, but tho&s;e who have eat and drunk and lived in &s;ocial intercour&s;e with him."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid, that if it was not trouble&s;ome and pre&s;uming too much, I would reque&s;t him to tell me all the little circum&s;tances of his life; what &s;chools he attended, when he came to Oxford, when he came to London, &amp;c. &amp;c. He did not di&s;approve of my curio&s;ity as to the&s;e particulars; but &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They'll come out by degrees as we talk together."</Q></P>
<P>He cen&s;ured Ruffhead's Life of Pope; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he knew nothing of Pope, and nothing of poetry."</Q> He prai&s;ed Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton's E&s;&s;ay on Pope; but &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould have no more of it, as the authour had not been able to per&s;uade the world to think of Pope as he did. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, &s;hould that prevent him from continuing his work? He is an ingenious Coun&s;el, who has made the mo&s;t of his cau&s;e: he is not obliged to gain it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, there is a difference when the cau&s;e is of a man's own making."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the proper u&s;e of riches. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"If I were a man of a great e&s;tate, I would drive all the ra&s;cals whom I did not like out of the county at an election."</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him how far he thought wealth &s;hould be employed in ho&s;pitality. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are to con&s;ider that ancient ho&s;pitality, of which we hear &s;o much, was in an uncommercial country, when men being idle, were glad to be entertained at rich men's tables. But in a commercial country, a bu&s;y country, time becomes precious, and therefore ho&s;pitality is not &s;o much valued. No doubt there is &s;till room for a certain degree of it; and a man has a &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing his friends eating and drinking around him. But promi&s;cuous ho&s;pitality is not the way to gain real influence. You mu&s;t help &s;ome people at table before others; you mu&s;t a&s;k &s;ome people how they like their wine oftener than others. You therefore offend more people than you plea&s;e. You are like the French &s;tate&s;man, who &s;aid, when he granted a favour, <HI>'J'at fait dix m&eacute;contens et un ingrat.'</HI> Be&s;ides, Sir, being entertained ever &s;o well at a man's table, impre&s;&s;es no la&s;ting regard or e&s;teem. No,
<PB N="366" REF="397" MS="y">
 Sir, the way to make &s;ure of power and influence is, by lending money confidentially to your neighbours at a &s;mall intere&s;t, or, perhaps, at no intere&s;t at all, and having their bonds in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"May not a man, Sir, employ his riches to advantage in educating young men of merit?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, if they fall in your way; but if it is under&s;tood that you patroni&s;e young men of merit, you will be harra&s;&s;ed with &s;olicitations. You will have numbers forced upon you who have no merit; &s;ome will force them upon you from mi&s;taken partiality; and &s;ome from downright intere&s;ted motives, without &s;cruple; and you will be di&s;graced.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"Were I a rich man, I would propagate all kinds of trees that will grow in the open air. A green-hou&s;e is childi&s;h. I would introduce foreign animals into the country; for in&s;tance, the rein-deer <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This project has &s;ince been reali&s;ed. Sir Henry Liddel, who made a &s;pirited tour into Lapland, brought two rein-deer to his e&s;tate in Northumberland, where they bred; but the race has unfortunately peri&s;hed.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now turned on critical &s;ubjects. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Bayes, in 'The Rehear&s;al,' is a mighty &s;illy character. If it was intended to be like a particular man, it could only be diverting while that man was remembered. But I que&s;tion whether it was meant for Dryden, as has been reported; for we know &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages &s;aid to be ridiculed, were written &s;ince the Rehear&s;al; at lea&s;t a pa&s;&s;age mentioned in the Preface is of a later date."</Q> I maintained that it had merit as a general &s;atire on the &s;elf-importance of dramatick authours. But even in this light he held it very cheap.</P>
<P>We then walked to the Pantheon. The fir&s;t view of it did not &s;trike us &s;o much as Ranelagh, of which he &s;aid, the <HI>coup d'oeil</HI> was the fine&s;t thing he had ever &s;een. The truth is, Ranelagh is of a more beautiful form; more of it, or rather indeed the whole <HI>rotunda,</HI> appears at once, and it is better lighted. However, as John&s;on ob&s;erved, we &s;aw the Pantheon in time of mourning, when there was a dull uniformity; whereas we had &s;een Ranelagh when the view was enlivened with a gay profu&s;ion of colours. Mrs. Bo&s;ville, of Gun|thwait, in York&s;hire, joined us, and entered into conver&s;ation with us. John&s;on &s;aid to me afterwards, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, this is a mighty intelligent lady."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid there was not half a guinea's worth of plea&s;ure in &s;eeing this place. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, there is half a guinea's worth of inferiority to other people in not having &s;een it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I doubt, Sir, whether there are many happy people here."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, there are many happy people here. There are many people here who are watching hundreds, and who think hundreds are watching them."</Q></P>

Happening to meet Sir Adam Fergu&s;&s;on, I pre&s;ented him to Dr. John&s;on.  Sir Adam expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that the Pantheon would encourage luxury. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) I am a great friend to publick amu&s;ements; for they keep people from vice. You now (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me,) would have been with a wench, had you not been here. O! I forgot you were married."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Adam &s;ugge&s;ted, that luxury corrupts a people, and de&s;troys the &s;pirit of liberty. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that is all vi&s;ionary. I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to the happine&s;s of an individual. Sir, the danger of the abu&s;e of power is nothing to a private man. What Frenchman is prevented from pa&s;&s;ing his life as he plea&s;es?"</Q> SIR ADAM. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, in the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution it is &s;urely of importance to keep up a &s;pirit in the people, &s;o as to pre&s;erve a balance again&s;t the crown."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I perceive you are a vile Whig.&mdash;Why all this childi&s;h jealou&s;y of the power of the crown? The crown has not power enough. When I &s;ay that all governments are alike, I con&s;ider that in no government power can be abu&s;ed long. Mankind will not bear it. If a &s;overeign oppre&s;&s;es his people to a great degree, they will ri&s;e and cut off his head. There is a remedy in human nature again&s;t tyranny, that will keep us &s;afe under every form of government. Had not the people of France thought them&s;elves honoured as &s;haring in the brilliant actions of the reign of Lewis XIV. they would not have endured him; and we may &s;ay the &s;ame of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's people."</Q> Sir Adam introduced the ancient Greeks and Romans. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the ma&s;s of both of them were bar|barians. The ma&s;s of every people mu&s;t be barbarous where there is no printing, and con&s;equently knowledge is not generally diffu&s;ed. Knowledge is diffu&s;ed among our people by the new&s;papers."</Q> Sir Adam mentioned the orators, poets, and arti&s;ts of Greece. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am talking of the ma&s;s of the people. We &s;ee even what the boa&s;ted Athenians were. The little effect which Demo&s;thenes's orations had upon them, &s;hews that they were barbarians."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Adam was unlucky in his topicks; for he &s;ugge&s;ted a doubt of the pro|priety of Bi&s;hops having &s;eats in the Hou&s;e of Lords. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, Sir? Who is more proper for having the dignity of a peer, than a Bi&s;hop, provided a Bi&s;hop be what he ought to be; and if improper Bi&s;hops be made, that is not the fault of the Bi&s;hops, but of tho&s;e who make them."</Q></P>
<P>On Sunday, April 5, after attending divine &s;ervice at St. Paul's church, I found him alone. Of a &s;choolma&s;ter of his acquaintance, a native of Scot|land,
<PB N="368" REF="399" MS="y">
 he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He has a great deal of good about him; but he is al&s;o very defective in &s;ome re&s;pects. His inner part is good, but his outer part is mighty aukward. You in Scotland do not attain that nice critical &s;kill in languages, which we get in our &s;chools in England. I would not put a boy to him, whom I intended for a man of learning. But for the &s;ons of citizens, who are to learn a little, get good morals, and then go to trade, he may do very well."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned a cau&s;e in which I had appeared as coun&s;el at the bar of the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland, where a <HI>Probationer,</HI> (as one licen&s;ed to preach, but not yet ordained, is called,) was oppo&s;ed in his appli|cation to be inducted, becau&s;e it was alledged that he had been guilty of fornication five years before. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, if he has repented, it is not a &s;ufficient objection. A man who is good enough to go to heaven, is good enough to be a clergyman."</Q> This was a humane and liberal &s;entiment. But the character of a clergyman is more &s;acred than that of an ordinary Chri&s;tian. As he is to in&s;truct with authority, he &s;hould be regarded with reverence, as one upon whom divine truth has had the effect to &s;et him above &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as men le&s;s exalted by &s;piritual habits, and yet upon the whole not to be excluded from heaven, have been betrayed into by the predo|minance of pa&s;&s;ion. That clergymen may be con&s;idered as &s;inners in general, as all men are, cannot be denied; but this reflection will not counteract their good precepts &s;o much, as the ab&s;olute knowledge of their having been guilty of certain &s;pecifick immoral acts. I told him, that by the rules of the Church of Scotland, in their <Q REND="inline">"Book of Di&s;cipline,"</Q> if a <HI>&s;candal,</HI> as it is called, is not pro&s;ecuted for five years, it cannot afterwards be proceeded upon, <Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s it be <HI>of a heinous nature,</HI> or again become flagrant;"</Q> and that hence a que&s;tion aro&s;e, whether fornication was a &s;in of a heinous nature; and that I had main|tained, that it did not de&s;erve that epithet, in as much as it was not one of tho&s;e &s;ins which argue very great depravity of heart: in &s;hort, was not, in the general acceptation of mankind, a heinous &s;in. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, it is not a heinous &s;in. A heinous &s;in is that for which a man is puni&s;hed with death or bani&s;hment."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, after I had argued that it was not a heinous &s;in, an old clergyman ro&s;e up, and repeating the text of &s;cripture denouncing judgement again&s;t whoremongers, a&s;ked, whether, con|&s;idering this, there could be any doubt of fornication being a heinous &s;in.</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, ob&s;erve the word <HI>whoremonger.</HI> Every &s;in, if per|&s;i&s;ted in, will become heinous. Whoremonger is a dealer in whores, as ironmonger is a dealer in iron. But as you don't call a man an ironmonger for
<PB N="369" REF="400" MS="y">
buying and &s;elling a pen-knife; &s;o you don't call a man a whoremonger for  getting one wench with child."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;poke of the inequality of the livings of the clergy in England, and the &s;canty provi&s;ions of &s;ome of the Curates. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, yes, Sir; but it cannot be helped. You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the revenues of the clergy are not at the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;tate, like the pay of the army. Different men have founded different churches; and &s;ome are better endowed, &s;ome wor&s;e. The State cannot interfere and make an equal divi&s;ion of what has been par|ticularly appropriated. Now when a clergyman has but a &s;mall living, or even two &s;mall livings, he can afford very little to a Curate."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, he went more frequently to church when there were prayers only, than when there was al&s;o a &s;ermon, as the people required more an example for the one than the other; it being much ea&s;ier for them to hear a &s;ermon, than to fix their minds on prayer.</P>
<P>On Monday, April 6, I dined with him at Sir Alexander Macdonald's, where was a young officer in the regimentals of the Scots Royal, who talked with a vivacity, fluency, and preci&s;ion &s;o uncommon, that he attracted parti|cular attention. He proved to be the Honourable Thomas Er&s;kine, younge&s;t brother to the Earl of Buchan, who has &s;ince ri&s;en into &s;uch brilliant repu|tation at the bar in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>Fielding being mentioned, John&s;on exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"he was a blockhead;"</Q> and upon my expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o &s;trange an a&s;&s;ertion, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What I mean by his being a blockhead is, that he was a barren ra&s;cal."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that he draws very natural pictures of human life?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, it is of very low life. Richard&s;on u&s;ed to &s;ay, that had he not known who Fielding was, he &s;hould have believed he was an o&s;tler. Sir, there is more knowledge of the heart in one letter of Richard&s;on's, than in all 'Tom Jones.' I, indeed, never read 'Jo&s;eph Andrews."</Q> ERSKINE. <Q REND="inline">"Surely, Sir, Richard&s;on is very tedious."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, if you were to read Richard&s;on for the &s;tory, your impatience would be &s;o much fretted, that you would hang your&s;elf. But you mu&s;t read him for the &s;enti|ment, and con&s;ider the &s;tory as only giving occa&s;ion to the &s;entiment."</Q>&mdash;I have already given my opinion of Fielding; but I cannot refrain from repeating here my wonder at John&s;on's exce&s;&s;ive and unaccountable depreciation of one of the be&s;t writers that England has produced. <Q REND="inline">"Tom Jones"</Q> has &s;tood the te&s;t of publick opinion with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, as to have e&s;tabli&s;hed its great merit, both for the &s;tory, the &s;entiments, and the manners, and al&s;o the varieties of diction, &s;o as to leave no doubt of its having an animated truth of execution throughout.</P>

 A book of travels, lately publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>Coriat Junior,</HI> and written by Mr. Pater&s;on, the auctioneer, was mentioned.

He had a mixture of learning, of wit, and of buffoonery. He fir&s;t travelled through Europe, and publi&s;hed his travels. He afterwards travelled on foot through A&s;ia, and had made many remarks; but he died at Mandoa, and his remarks were lo&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of gaming, and animadverted on it with &s;everity. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, gentlemen, let us not aggravate the matter. It is not roguery to play with a man who is ignorant of the game, while you are ma&s;ter of it, and &s;o win his money; for he thinks he can play better than you, as you think you can play better than he; and the &s;uperiour &s;kill carries it."</Q> ERSKINE. <Q REND="inline">"He is a fool, but you are not a rogue."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That's much about the truth, Sir. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that a man who only does what every one of the &s;ociety to which he belongs would do, is not a di&s;|hone&s;t man. In the republick of Sparta it was agreed, that &s;tealing was not di&s;honourable, if not di&s;covered. I do not commend a &s;ociety where there is an agreement that what would not otherwi&s;e be fair, &s;hall be fair; but I main|tain, that an individual of any &s;ociety, who practi&s;es what is allowed, is not a di&s;hone&s;t man."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So then, Sir, you do not think ill of a man who wins perhaps forty thou&s;and pounds in a winter?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not call a game&s;ter a di&s;hone&s;t man; but I call him an un&s;ocial man, an unprofitable man. Gaming is a mode of transferring property without producing any intermediate good. Trade gives employment to numbers, and &s;o produces intermediate good."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine told us, that when he was in the i&s;land of Minorca, he not only read prayers, but preached two &s;ermons to the regiment. He &s;eemed to object to the pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture where we are told that the angel of the Lord &s;mote in one night forty thou&s;and A&s;&s;yrians. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) you &s;hould recollect that there was a &s;upernatural interpo&s;ition; they were de&s;troyed by pe&s;tilence. You are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the angel of the Lord went about and &s;tabbed each of them with a dagger, or knocked them on the head, man by man&punc;"</Q></P>
<P>After Mr. Er&s;kine was gone, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion took place, whether the pre|&s;ent Earl of Buchan, when Lord Cardro&s;s, did right to refu&s;e to go Secre|tary of the Emba&s;&s;y to Spain, when Sir James Gray, a man of inferiour rank, went Amba&s;&s;adour. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, that perhaps in point of
<PB N="371" REF="402" MS="y">
intere&s;t he did wrong; but in point of dignity he did well. Sir Alexander in&s;i&s;ted that he was wrong, and &s;aid that Mr. Pitt intended it as an advan|tageous thing for him. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) Mr. Pitt might think it an advantageous thing for him to make him a vintner, and get him all the Portugal trade; but he would have demeaned him&s;elf &s;trangely had he accepted of &s;uch a &s;ituation. Sir, had he gone Secretary while his inferiour was Amba&s;&s;adour, he would have been a traitor to his rank and family."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of the little attachment which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between near relations in London. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) in a country &s;o commercial as ours, where every man can do for him&s;elf, there is not &s;o much occa&s;ion for that attach|ment. No man is thought the wor&s;e of here, who&s;e brother was hanged. In uncommercial countries, many of the branches of a family mu&s;t depend on the &s;tock; &s;o, in order to make the head of the family take care of them, they are repre&s;ented as connected with his reputation, that, &s;elf-love being inte|re&s;ted, he may exert him&s;elf to promote their intere&s;t. You have fir&s;t large circles, or clans; as commerce increa&s;es, the connection is confined to families. By degrees, that too goes off, as having become unnece&s;&s;ary, and there being few opportunities of intercour&s;e. One brother is a merchant in the city, and another is an officer in the guards. How little intercour&s;e can the&s;e two have!"</Q></P>
<P>I argued warmly for the old &s;eudal &s;y&s;tem. Sir Alexander oppo&s;ed it, and talked of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing all men free and independent. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I agree with Mr. Bo&s;well that there mu&s;t be a high &s;atisfaction in being a feudal Lord; but we are to con&s;ider, that we ought not to wi&s;h to have a number of men unhappy for the &s;atisfaction of one."</Q>&mdash;I maintained that numbers, namely, the va&s;&s;als or followers, were not unhappy, for that there was a reciprocal &s;atisfaction between the Lord and them: he being kind in his authority over them; they being re&s;pectful and faithful to him.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 9, I called on him to beg he would go and dine with me at the Mitre tavern. He had re&s;olved not to dine at all this day, I know not for what rea&s;on; and I was &s;o unwilling to be deprived of his company, that I was content to &s;ubmit to &s;uffer a want, which was at fir&s;t &s;omewhat painful, but he &s;oon made me forget it; and a man is always plea&s;ed with him|&s;elf when he finds his intellectual inclinations predominate.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that to rea&s;on too philo&s;ophically on the nature of prayer, was very unprofitable.</P>
<P>Talking of gho&s;ts, he &s;aid, he knew one friend, who was an hone&s;t man and a &s;en&s;ible man, who told him he had &s;een a gho&s;t, old Mr. Edward

He only &s;eemed willing, as a candid enquirer after truth, however &s;trange and inexplicable, to &s;hew that he under|&s;tood what might be urged for it <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See this curious que&s;tion treated by him with mo&s;t acute ability, <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Friday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, where we found Dr. Gold&s;mith.</P>
<P>Armorial bearings having been mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, they were as ancient as the &s;iege of Thebes, which he proved by a pa&s;&s;age in one of the tragedies of Euripides.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted the que&s;tion whether duelling was con&s;i&s;tent with moral duty. The brave old General fired at this, and &s;aid, with a lofty air, <Q REND="inline">"Undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his honour."</Q> GOLDSMITH, (turning to me.) <Q REND="inline">"I a&s;k you fir&s;t, Sir, what you would do if you were affronted?"</Q> I an&s;wered I &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to fight. <Q REND="inline">"Why then (replied Gold&s;mith,) that &s;olves the que&s;tion."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, it does not &s;olve the que&s;tion. It does not follow that what a man would do is therefore right."</Q> I &s;aid, I wi&s;hed to have it &s;ettled, whether duelling was contrary to the laws of Chri&s;tianity. John&s;on immediately entered on the &s;ubject, and treated it in a ma&s;terly manner; and &s;o far as I have been able to recollect, his thoughts were the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, as men become in a high degree refined, various cau&s;es of offence ari&s;e; which are con&s;idered to be of &s;uch importance, that life mu&s;t be &s;taked to atone for them, though in reality they are not &s;o. A body that has received a very fine poli&s;h may be ea&s;ily hurt. Before men arrive at this artificial refinement, if one tells his neighbour he lies, his neighbour tells him he lies; if one gives his neighbour a blow, his neighbour gives him a blow: but in a &s;tate of highly poli&s;hed &s;ociety, an affront is held to be a &s;erious injury. It mu&s;t,
<PB N="373" REF="404" MS="y">
therefore, be re&s;ented, or rather a duel&punc; mu&s;t be fought upon it; as men have agreed to bani&s;h from their &s;ociety one who puts up with an affront without fighting a duel. Now, Sir, it is never unlawful to fight in &s;elf-defence. He, then, who fights a duel, does not fight from pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t his antagoni&s;t, but out of &s;elf-defence; to avert the &s;tigma of the world, and to prevent him&s;elf from being driven out of &s;ociety. I could wi&s;h that there was not that &s;uper|fluity of refinement; but while &s;uch notions prevail, no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel."</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remembered, that this ju&s;tification is applicable only to the per&s;on who <HI>receives</HI> an affront. All mankind mu&s;t condemn the aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The General told us, that when he was a very young man, I think only fifteen, &s;erving under Prince Eugene of Savoy, he was &s;itting in a company at table with a Prince of Wirtemberg. The Prince took up a gla&s;s of wine, and, by a fillip, made &s;ome of it fly in Oglethorpe's face. Here was a nice dilemma. To have challenged him in&s;tantly, might have fixed a quarrel&s;ome character upon the young &s;oldier: to have taken no notice of it might have been con&s;idered as cowardice. Oglethorpe, therefore, keeping his eye upon the Prince, and &s;miling all the time, as if he took what his Highne&s;s had done in je&s;t, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Mon Prince,</HI>&mdash;"</Q> (I forget the French words he u&s;ed, the purport however was,) <Q REND="inline">"That's a good joke; but we do it much better in England;"</Q> and threw a whole gla&s;s of wine in the Prince's face. An old General who &s;at by, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"I'l a bien fait, mon Prince, vous l'avez commenc&eacute;;"</HI></Q> and thus all ended in good humour.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, General, give us an account of the &s;iege of Bender."</Q> Upon which the General, pouring a little wine upon the table, de&s;cribed every thing with a wet finger: <Q REND="inline">"Here were we, here were the Turks,"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. John&s;on li&s;tened with the clo&s;e&s;t attention.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion was &s;tarted, how far people who di&s;agree in any capital point can live in friend&s;hip together. John&s;on &s;aid they might. Gold&s;mith &s;aid they could not, as they had not the <HI>idem velle atque idem nolle</HI>&mdash;the &s;ame likings and the &s;ame aver&s;ions. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you mu&s;t &s;hun the &s;ubject as to which you di&s;agree. For in&s;tance, I can live very well with Burke: I love his know|ledge, his genius, his diffu&s;ion, and affluence of conver&s;ation; but I would not talk to him of the Rockingham party."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, when people live together who have &s;omething as to which they di&s;agree, and which they want to &s;hun, they will be in the &s;ituation mentioned in the &s;tory of Bluebeard; 'You may look into all the chambers but one.' But we &s;hould have the greate&s;t inclination to look into that chamber, to talk of that &s;ubject."</Q> JOHNSON,
<PB N="374" REF="405" MS="y">
 (with a loud voice.) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am not &s;aying that <HI>you</HI> could live in friend&s;hip with a man from whom you differ as to &s;ome point: I am only &s;aying that <HI>I</HI> could do it. You put me in mind of Sappho in Ovid."</Q></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith told us, that he was now bu&s;y in writing a natural hi&s;tory, and, that he might have full lei&s;ure for it, he had taken lodgings at a farmer's hou&s;e, near to the &s;ix mile-&s;tone, on the Edgeware-road, and had carried down his books in two returned po&s;t-chai&s;es. He &s;aid, he believed the farmer's family thought him an odd character, &s;imilar to that in which the <HI>Spectator</HI> appeared to his landlady and children: he was <HI>The Gentleman.</HI> Mr. Mickle, the tran&s;lator of <Q REND="inline">"The Lu&s;iad,"</Q> and I, went to vi&s;it him at this place a few days afterwards. He was not at home; but having a curio&s;ity to &s;ee his apart|ment, we went in and found curious &s;craps of de&s;criptions of animals, &s;crawled upon the walls with a black lead pencil.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of gho&s;ts having been introduced, John&s;on repeated what he had told me of a friend of his, an hone&s;t man and a man of &s;en&s;e, having a&s;&s;erted to him that he had &s;een an apparition. Gold&s;mith told us, he was a&s;&s;ured by his brother, the Reverend Mr. Gold&s;mith, that he al&s;o had &s;een one. General Oglethorpe told us, that Pendergra&s;t, an officer in the Duke of Marlborough's army, had mentioned to many of his friends that he &s;hould die on a particular day. That upon that day a battle took place with the French; that after it was over, and Pendergra&s;t was &s;till alive, his brother officers, while they were yet in the field, je&s;tingly a&s;ked him where was his prophecy now. Pendergra&s;t gravely an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall die, notwith&s;tanding what you &s;ee."</Q> Soon afterwards there came a &s;hot from a French battery, to which the orders for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms had not yet reached, and he was killed upon the &s;pot. Colonel Cecil, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his effects, found in his pocket|book the following &s;olemn entry:</P>
<P>[Here the date.] <Q REND="inline">"Dreamt&mdash;or&mdash;<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Here was a blank, which may be &s;illed up thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"was told by an apparition;"</HI></Q>&mdash;the writer being probably uncertain whether he was a&s;leep or awake when his mind was impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;olemn pre&s;entiment with which the fact afterwards happened &s;o wonderfully to corre&s;pond.</NOTE> Sir John Friend meets me:"</Q> (here the very day on which he was killed was mentioned.) Pendergra&s;t had been a witne&s;s again&s;t Sir John Friend, who was executed for high trea&s;on. General Oglethorpe &s;aid, he was in company with Colonel Cecil when Pope came and enquired into the truth of this &s;tory, which made a great noi&s;e at the time, and was then confirmed by the Colonel.</P>
<P>On Saturday, April 11, he appointed me to come to him in the evening, when he &s;aid he &s;hould be at lei&s;ure to give me &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the defence
<PB N="375" REF="406">
of Ha&s;tie, the &s;choolma&s;ter of Campbelltown, for whom I was to appear in the Hou&s;e of Lords. When I came, I found him unwilling to exert him&s;elf. I pre&s;&s;ed him to write down his thoughts upon the &s;ubject. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There's no occa&s;ion for my writing. I'll talk to you."</Q> He was, however, at la&s;t prevailed on to dictate to me, while I wrote as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The charge is, that he has u&s;ed immoderate and cruel correction. Cor|rection, in it&s;elf, is not cruel; children, being not rea&s;onable, can be governed only by fear. To impre&s;s this fear, is therefore one of the fir&s;t duties of tho&s;e who have the care of children. It is the duty of a parent; and has never been thought incon&s;i&s;tent with parental tenderne&s;s. It is the duty of a ma&s;ter, who is in his highe&s;t exaltation when he is <HI>loco parentis.</HI> Yet, as good things become evil by exce&s;s, correction, by being immoderate, may become cruel. But when is correction immoderate? When it is more frequent or more &s;evere than is required <HI>ad monendum et docendum,</HI> for reformation and in&s;truc|tion. No &s;everity is cruel which ob&s;tinacy makes nece&s;&s;ary; for the greate&s;t cruelty would be to de&s;i&s;t, and leave the &s;cholar too carele&s;s for in&s;truction, and too much hardened for reproof. Locke, in his treati&s;e of Education, mentions a mother, with applau&s;e, who whipped an infant eight times before &s;he had &s;ubdued it; for had &s;he &s;topped at the &s;eventh act of correction, her daughter, &s;ays he, would have been ruined. The degrees of ob&s;tinacy in young minds are very different; as different mu&s;t be the degrees of per&s;evering &s;everity. A &s;tubborn &s;cholar mu&s;t be corrected till he is &s;ubdued. The di&s;cipline of a &s;chool is military. There mu&s;t be either unbounded licence or ab&s;olute autho|rity. The ma&s;ter who puni&s;hes, not only con&s;ults the future happine&s;s of him who is the immediate &s;ubject of correction; but he propagates obedience through the whole &s;chool, and e&s;tabli&s;hes regularity by exemplary ju&s;tice. The victorious ob&s;tinacy of a &s;ingle boy would make his future endeavours of reformation or in&s;truction totally ineffectual. Ob&s;tinacy, therefore, mu&s;t never be victorious. Yet, it is well known, that there &s;ometimes occurs a fullen and hardy re&s;olution, that laughs at all common puni&s;hment, and bids defiance to all common degrees of pain. Correction mu&s;t be proportioned to occa&s;ions. The flexible will be reformed by gentle di&s;cipline, and the refractory mu&s;t be &s;ubdued by har&s;her methods. The degrees of &s;chola&s;tick, as of military puni&s;hment, no &s;tated rules can a&s;certain. It mu&s;t be enforced till it overpowers temptation; till &s;tubbornne&s;s becomes &s;lexible, and perver&s;e|ne&s;s regular. Cu&s;tom and rea&s;on have, indeed, &s;et &s;ome bounds to &s;chola&s;tick penalties. The &s;choolma&s;ter inflicts no capital puni&s;hments; nor enforces his edicts by either death or mutilation. The civil law has wi&s;ely determined,
<PB N="376" REF="407">
 that a ma&s;ter who &s;trikes at a &s;cholar's eye &s;hall be con&s;idered as criminal. But puni&s;hments, however &s;evere, that produce no la&s;ting evil, may be ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, becau&s;e they may be nece&s;&s;ary. Such have been the puni&s;h|ments u&s;ed by the re&s;pondent. No &s;cholar has gone from him either blind or lame, or with any of his limbs or powers injured or impaired. They were irregular, and he puni&s;hed them: they were ob&s;tinate, and he enforced his puni&s;hment. But, however provoked, he never exceeded the limits of mode|ration, for he inflicted nothing beyond pre&s;ent pain; and how much of that was required, no man is &s;o little able to determine as tho&s;e who have deter|mined again&s;t him;&mdash;the parents of the offenders.&mdash;It has been &s;aid, that he u&s;ed unprecedented and improper in&s;truments of correction. Of this accu&s;a|tion the meaning is not very ea&s;y to be found. No in&s;trument of correction is more proper than another, but as it is better adapted to produce pre&s;ent pain without la&s;ting mi&s;chief. Whatever were his in&s;truments, no la&s;ting mi&s;|chief has en&s;ued; and therefore, however unu&s;ual, in hands &s;o cautious they were proper.&mdash;It has been objected, that the re&s;pondent admits the charge of cruelty, by producing no evidence to confute it. Let it be con&s;idered, that his &s;cholars are either di&s;per&s;ed at large in the world, or continue to inhabit the place in which they were bred. Tho&s;e who are di&s;per&s;ed cannot be found: tho&s;e who remain are the &s;ons of his per&s;ecutors, and are not likely to &s;upport a man to whom their fathers are enemies. If it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the enmity of their fathers proves the ju&s;tice of the charge, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered how often experience &s;hews us, that men who are angry on one ground will accu&s;e on another; with how little kindne&s;s, in a town of low trade, a man who lives by learning is regarded; and how implicitly, where the inhabitants are not very rich, a rich man is hearkened to and followed. In a place like Campbell|town it is ea&s;y for one of the principal inhabitants to make a party. It is ea&s;y for that party to heat them&s;elves with imaginary grievances. It is ea&s;y for them to oppre&s;s a man poorer than them&s;elves; and natural to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of riches, by per&s;i&s;ting in oppre&s;&s;ion. The argument which attempts to prove the impropriety of re&s;toring him to his &s;chool, by alledging that he has lo&s;t the confidence of the people, is not the &s;ubject of juridical con&s;idera|tion; for he is to &s;uffer, if he mu&s;t &s;uffer, not for their judgement, but for his own actions. It may be convenient for them to have another ma&s;ter; but it is a convenience of their own making. It would be likewi&s;e convenient for him to find another &s;chool; but this convenience he cannot obtain.&mdash;The que&s;tion is not what is now convenient, but what is generally right. If the
<PB N="377" REF="408" MS="y">
people of Campbelltown be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the re&s;toration of the re&s;pondent, they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed only by their own fault; by turbulent pa&s;&s;ions and unrea|&s;onable de&s;ires; by tyranny, which law has defeated, and by malice which virtue has &s;urmounted."</Q></P>

<P>On Tue&s;day, April 14, the decree of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion in the &s;chool-ma&s;ter's cau&s;e was rever&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, after a very eloquent &s;peech by Lord Mansfield, who &s;hewed him&s;elf an adept in &s;chool di&s;cipline, but I thought was too rigorous towards my client. On the evening of the next day I &s;upped with Dr. John&s;on, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, in company with Mr. Langton and his brother-in-law, Lord Binning. I repeated a &s;entence of Lord Mansfield's &s;peech, of which, by the aid of Mr. Longlands, the &s;olicitor on the other &s;ide, who obligingly allowed me to com|pare his note with my own, I have a full copy: <Q REND="inline">"My Lords, &s;everity is not the way to govern either boys or men."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Nay, (&s;aid John&s;on,) it is the way to <HI>govern</HI> them. I know not whether it be the way to <HI>mend</HI> them."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of the recent expul&s;ion of &s;ix &s;tudents from the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, who were methodi&s;ts; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not de&s;i&s;t from publickly praying and exhorting. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that expul&s;ion was extremely ju&s;t and proper. What have they to do at an Univer&s;ity who are not willing to be taught, but will pre&s;ume to teach? Where is religion to be learnt but at an Univer&s;ity? Sir, they were examined, and found to be mighty ignorant fellows."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, was it not hard, Sir, to expel them, for I am told they were good beings?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I believe they might be good beings; but they were not fit to be in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. A cow is a very good animal in the field; but we turn her out of a garden."</Q> Lord Elibank u&s;ed to repeat this as an illu&s;tration uncommonly happy.</P>
<P>De&s;irous of calling John&s;on forth to talk, and exerci&s;e his wit, though I &s;hould my&s;elf be the object of it, I re&s;olutely ventured to undertake the defence of convivial indulgence in wine, though he was not to-night in the
<PB N="378" REF="409" MS="y"> mo&s;t genial humour. After urging the common plau&s;ible topicks, I at la&s;t had recour&s;e to the maxim, <HI>in vino veritas;</HI> a man who is well warmed with wine will &s;peak truth. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that may be an argument for drinking, if you &s;uppo&s;e men in general to be liars. But, Sir, I would not keep company with a fellow who lyes as long as he is &s;ober, and whom you mu&s;t make drunk before you can get a word of truth out of him <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi, in her <Q REND="inline">"Anecdotes,"</Q> p. 261, has given an erroneous account of this incident, as of many others. She pretends to relate it from recollection, as if &s;he her&s;elf had been pre&s;ent; when the fact is, that it was communicated to her by me. She has repre&s;ented it as a per|&s;onality, and the true point has e&s;caped her.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Langton told us he was about to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;chool upon his e&s;tate, but it had been &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that it might have a tendency to make the people le&s;s indu&s;trious. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. While learning to read and write is a di&s;tinction, the few who have that di&s;tinction may be the le&s;s inclined to work: but when every body learns to read and write, it is no longer a di&s;tinction. A man who has a laced wai&s;tcoat is too fine a man to work; but if every body had laced wai&s;tcoats, we &s;hould have people working in laced wai&s;t|coats. There are no people whatever more indu&s;trious, none who work more, than our manufacturers; yet they have all learnt to read and write. Sir, you mu&s;t not neglect doing a thing immediately good, from fear of remote evil;&mdash;from fear of its being abu&s;ed. A man who has candles may &s;it up too late, which he would not do if he had not candles; but nobody will deny that the art of making candles, by which light is continued to us beyond the time that the &s;un gives us light, is a valuable art, and ought to be pre&s;erved."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, would it not be better to follow Nature; and go to bed and ri&s;e ju&s;t as Nature gives us light or with-holds it?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; for then we &s;hould have no kind of equality in the partition of our time between &s;leeping and waking. It would be very different in different &s;ea&s;ons and in different places. In &s;ome of the northern parts of Scotland how little light is there in the depth of winter!"</Q></P>
<P>We talked of Tacitus, and I hazarded an opinion, that with all his merit for penetration, &s;hrewdne&s;s of judgement, and ter&s;ene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, he was too compact, too much broken into hints, as it were, and therefore too diffi|cult to be under&s;tood. To my great &s;atisfaction Dr. John&s;on &s;anctioned this opinion. <Q REND="inline">"Tacitus, Sir, &s;eems to me rather to have made notes for an hi&s;|torical work, than to have written a hi&s;tory <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that Lord Monboddo, whom on account of his re&s;embling Dr. John&s;on in &s;ome particulars, Foote called an Elzevir edition of him, has, by coincidence, made the very &s;ame remark. <HI>Origin and Progre&s;s of Language,</HI> vol. iii. 2d edit. p. 219.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

At this time it appears from his <Q REND="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</Q> that he had been more than commonly diligent in religious duties, particularly in reading the holy &s;criptures. It was Pa&s;&s;ion Week, that &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on which the Chri&s;tian world has appropriated to the commemoration of the my&s;teries of our redemption, and during which, whatever embers of religion are in our brea&s;ts, will be kindled into pious warmth.</P>
<P>I paid him &s;hort vi&s;its both on Friday and Saturday, and &s;eeing his large folio Greek Te&s;tament before him, beheld him with a reverential awe, and would not intrude upon his time.

<P>On Sunday, April 19, being Ea&s;ter-day, General Paoli and I paid him a vi&s;it before dinner. We talked of the notion that blind per&s;ons can di&s;tingui&s;h colours by the touch. John&s;on &s;aid, that Profe&s;&s;or Sander&s;on mentions his having attempted to do it, but that he found he was aiming at an impo&s;&s;ibility; that to be &s;ure a difference in the &s;urface makes the difference of colours; but that difference is &s;o fine, that it is not &s;en&s;ible to the touch. The General mentioned jugglers and fraudulent game&s;ters, who could know cards by the touch. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"the cards u&s;ed by &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t be le&s;s poli&s;hed than ours commonly are."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of &s;ounds. The General &s;aid, there was no beauty in a &s;imple &s;ound but only in an harmonious compo&s;ition of &s;ounds. I pre&s;umed to differ from this opinion, and mentioned the &s;oft and &s;weet &s;ound of a fine woman's voice. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, if a &s;erpent or a toad uttered it, you would think it ugly."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So you would think, Sir, were a beautiful tune to be uttered by one of tho&s;e animals."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, it would be admired. We have &s;een fine fidlers whom we liked as little as toads,"</Q> (laughing).</P>
<P>Talking on the &s;ubject of ta&s;te in the arts, he &s;aid, that difference of ta&s;te was, in truth, difference of &s;kill. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is there not a quality
<PB N="380" REF="411" MS="y"> called ta&s;te, which con&s;i&s;ts merely in perception or in liking? For in&s;tance, we find people differ much as to what is the be&s;t &s;tyle of Engli&s;h compo&s;ition. Some think Swift's the be&s;t; others prefer a fuller and grander way of writing."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you mu&s;t fir&s;t define what you mean by &s;tyle, before you can judge who has a good ta&s;te in &s;tyle, and who has a bad. The two cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons whom you have mentioned don't differ as to good and bad. They both agree that Swift has a good neat &s;tyle; but one loves a neat &s;tyle, another loves a &s;tyle of more &s;plendour. In like manner, one loves a plain coat, another loves a laced coat; but neither will deny that each is good in its kind."</Q></P>
<P>While I remained in London this &s;pring, I was with him at &s;everal other times, both by him&s;elf and in company. I dined with him one day at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with Lord Elibank, Mr. Langton, and Dr. Van&s;ittart of Oxford. Without &s;pecifying each particular day, I have pre&s;erved the following memorable things.</P>
<P>I regretted the reflection in his Preface to Shak&s;peare again&s;t Garrick, to whom we cannot but apply the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline">"I collated &s;uch copies as I could procure, and wi&s;hed for more, but have not found the collectors of the&s;e rarities very communicative."</Q> I told him, that Garrick had complained to me of it, and had vindicated him&s;elf by a&s;&s;uring me, that John&s;on was made welcome to the full u&s;e of his collection, and that he left the key of it with a &s;ervant, with orders to have a fire and every convenience for him. I found John&s;on's notion was, that Garrick wanted to be courted for them, and that, on the contrary, Garrick &s;hould have courted him, and &s;ent him the plays of his own accord. But, indeed, con&s;idering the flovenly and carele&s;s manner in which books were treated by John&s;on, it could not be expected that &s;carce and valuable editions &s;hould have been lent to him.</P>
<P>A gentleman having to &s;ome of the u&s;ual arguments for drinking added this: <Q REND="inline">"You know, Sir, drinking drives away care, and makes us forget what|ever is di&s;agreeable. Would not you allow a man to drink for that rea&s;on?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, if he &s;at next <HI>you."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed a liking for Mr. Francis O&s;born's works, and a&s;ked him what he thought of that writer. He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"A conceited fellow. Were a man to write &s;o now, the boys would throw &s;tones at him."</Q> He however did not alter my opinion of a favourite authour, to whom I was fir&s;t directed by his being quoted in <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> and in whom I have found much &s;hrewd and lively &s;en&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed indeed in a &s;tyle &s;omewhat quaint, which, however, I do not di&s;like. His book has an air of originality. We figure to our&s;elves an ancient gentleman talking to us.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="412" MS="y">
When one of his friends endeavoured to maintain that a country gentleman might contrive to pa&s;s his life very agreeably, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) you cannot give me an in&s;tance of any man who is permitted to lay out his own time, contriving not to have tedious hours."</Q> This ob&s;ervation, however, is equally applicable to gentlemen who live in cities, and are of no profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"there is no permanent national character; it varies according to circum&s;tances. Alexander the Great &s;wept India: now the Turks &s;weep Greece."</Q></P>
<P>A learned gentleman who in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation wi&s;hed to inform us of this &s;imple fact, that the Coun&s;el upon the circuit at Shrew&s;bury were much bitten by fleas, took, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;even or eight minutes in relating it circum|&s;tantially. He in a plenitude of phra&s;e told us, that large bales of woollen cloth were lodged in the town-hall;&mdash;that by rea&s;on of this, fleas ne&s;tled there in prodigious numbers;&mdash;that the lodgings of the Coun&s;el were near to the town-hall;&mdash;and that tho&s;e little animals moved from place to place with wonderful agility. John&s;on &s;at in great impatience till the gentleman had fini&s;hed his tedious narrative, and then bur&s;t out, <Q REND="inline">"It is a pity, Sir, that you have not &s;een a lion; for a flea has taken you &s;uch a time, that a lion mu&s;t have &s;erved you a twelvemonth <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi, to whom I told this anecdote, has related it, as if the gentleman had given <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>natural hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>mou&s;e."</HI></Q> Anecdotes, p. 191.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>He would not allow Scotland to derive any credit from Lord Mansfield; for he was educated in England. <Q REND="inline">"Much (&s;aid he,) may be made of a Scotchman, if he be <HI>caught</HI> young."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of a modern hi&s;torian and a modern morali&s;t, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There is more thought in the morali&s;t than in the hi&s;torian. There is but a &s;hallow &s;tream of thought in hi&s;tory."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But &s;urely, Sir, an hi&s;torian has reflection."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why yes, Sir; and &s;o has a cat when &s;he catches a mou&s;e for her kitten. But &s;he cannot write like the morali&s;t; neither can the hi&s;torian."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am very unwilling to read the manu&s;cripts of authours, and give them my opinion. If the authours who apply to me have money, I bid them boldly print without a name; if they have written in order to get money, I tell them to go to the book&s;ellers, and make the be&s;t bargain they can."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, if a book&s;eller &s;hould bring you a manu|&s;cript to look at."</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I would de&s;ire the book&s;eller to take it away."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="413" MS="y"> I mentioned a friend of mine who had re&s;ided long in Spain, and was unwilling to return to Britain. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he is attached to &s;ome woman."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I rather believe, Sir, it is the fine climate which keeps him there."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, how can you talk &s;o?

You may advi&s;e me to go and live at Bologna to eat &s;au&s;ages. The &s;au&s;ages there, are the be&s;t in the world; they lo&s;e much by being carried."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 9, Mr. Demp&s;ter and I had agreed to dine by our&s;elves at the Briti&s;h coffee-hou&s;e. John&s;on, on whom I happened to call in the morning, &s;aid, he would join us, which he did, and we &s;pent a very plea&s;ant day, though I recollect but little of what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Walpole was a mini&s;ter given by the King to the people: Pitt was a mini&s;ter given by the people to the King,&mdash;as an adjunct."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The misfortune of Gold&s;mith in conver&s;ation is this: he goes on without knowing how he is to get off. His genius is great, but his knowledge is &s;mall.

<P>Before leaving London this year, I con&s;ulted him upon a que&s;tion purely of Scotch law. It was held of old, and continued for a long period, to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle in that law, that whoever intermeddled with the effects of a per&s;on decea&s;ed, without the interpo&s;ition of legal authority to guard again&s;t embezzlement, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to pay all the debts of the decea&s;ed, as having been guilty of what was technically called <HI>vitious intromi&s;&s;ion.</HI> The Court of Se&s;&s;ion had gradually relaxed the &s;trictne&s;s of this principle, where the inter|ference proved had been incon&s;iderable. In a ca&s;e<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Wil&s;on again&s;t Smith and Armour.</NOTE> which came before that Court the preceding winter, I had laboured to per&s;uade the Judges to return to the ancient law. It was my own &s;incere opinion, that they ought to adhere to it; but I had exhau&s;ted all my powers of rea&s;oning in vain. John&s;on thought as I did; and in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my application to the Court for a revi&s;ion and alteration of the judgement, he dictated to me the following argument:</P>
<Q><P>This, we are told, is a law which has its force only from the long prac|tice of the Court; and may, therefore, be &s;u&s;pended or modified as the Court &s;hall think proper.</P>
<P>Concerning the power of the Court to make or to &s;u&s;pend a law, we have no intention to inquire. It is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e that every ju&s;t law is
<PB N="383" REF="414">
dictated by rea&s;on; and that the practice of every legal Court is regulated by equity. It is the quality of rea&s;on to be invariable and con&s;tant; and of equity, to give to one man what, in the &s;ame ca&s;e, is given to another. The advantage which humanity derives from law is this: that the law gives every man a rule of action, and pre&s;cribes a mode of conduct which &s;hall entitle him to the &s;upport and protection of &s;ociety. That the law may be a rule of action, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it be known;&mdash;it is nece&s;&s;ary that it be permanent and &s;table. The law is the mea&s;ure of civil right; but if the mea&s;ure be changeable, the extent of the thing mea&s;ured never can be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>To permit a law to be modified at di&s;cretion, is to leave the community without law. It is to withdraw the direction of that publick wi&s;dom, by which the deficiencies of private under&s;tanding are to be &s;upplied. It is to &s;uffer the ra&s;h and ignorant to act at di&s;cretion, and then to depend for the legality of that action on the &s;entence of the Judge. He that is thus governed, lives not by law, but by opinion: not by a certain rule to which he can apply his intention before he acts, but by an uncertain and variable opinion, which he can never know but after he has committed the act on which that opinion &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed. He lives by a law (if a law it be,) which he can never know before he has offended it. To this ca&s;e may be ju&s;tly applied that important principle, <HI>mi&s;era e&s;t &s;ervitus ubi jus e&s;t aut incognitum aut vagum.</HI> If Intromi&s;|&s;ion be not criminal till it exceeds a certain point, and that point be un&s;ettled, and con&s;equently different in different minds, the right of Intromi&s;&s;ion, and the right of the Creditor ari&s;ing from it, are all <HI>jura vaga,</HI> and, by con&s;e|quence, are <HI>jura incognita;</HI> and the re&s;ult can be no other than a <HI>mi&s;era &s;ervitus,</HI> an uncertainty concerning the event of action, a &s;ervile dependance on private opinion.</P>
<P>It may be urged, and with great plau&s;ibility, that there may be Intro|mi&s;&s;ion without fraud; which, however true, will by no means ju&s;tify an occa&s;ional and arbitrary relaxation of the law. The end of law is protection as well as vengeance. Indeed, vengeance is never u&s;ed but to &s;trengthen protection. That &s;ociety only is well governed, where life is freed from danger and from &s;u&s;picion; where po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;o &s;heltered by &s;alutary prohibitions, that violation is prevented more frequently than puni&s;hed. Such a prohibition was this, while it operated with its original force. The creditor of the decea&s;ed was not only without lo&s;s, but without fear. He was not to &s;eek a remedy for an injury &s;uffered; for injury was warded off.</P>
<P>As the law has been &s;ometimes admini&s;tered, it lays us open to wounds, becau&s;e it is imagined to have the power of healing. To puni&s;h fraud when
<PB N="384" REF="415"> it is detected, is the proper act of vindictive ju&s;tice; but to prevent frauds, and make puni&s;hment unnece&s;&s;ary, is the great employment of legi&s;lative wi&s;dom. To permit Intromi&s;&s;ion, and to puni&s;h fraud, is to make law no better than a pitfall. To tread upon the brink is &s;afe; but to come a &s;tep further is de&s;truction. But, &s;urely, it is better to enclo&s;e the gulf, and hinder all acce&s;s, than by encouraging us to advance a little, to entice us afterwards a little further, and let us perceive our folly only by our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As law &s;upplies the weak with adventitious &s;trength, it likewi&s;e enlightens the ignorant with extrin&s;ick under&s;tanding. Law teaches us to know when we commit injury, and when we &s;uffer it. It fixes certain marks upon actions, by which we are admoni&s;hed to do or to forbear them. <HI>Qui &s;ibi bene temperat in licitis,</HI> &s;ays one of the fathers, <HI>nunquam cadet in illicita.</HI> He who never intro|mits at all, will never intromit with fraudulent intentions.</P>
<P>The relaxation of the law again&s;t vicious intromi&s;&s;ion has been very favourably repre&s;ented by a great ma&s;ter of juri&s;prudence <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lord Kames, in his <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;torical Law Tracts."</Q></NOTE>, who&s;e words have been exhibited with unnece&s;&s;ary pomp, and &s;eem to be con&s;idered as irre&s;i&s;tibly deci&s;ive. The great moment of his authority makes it nece&s;&s;ary to examine his po&s;ition. <Q REND="inline">'Some ages ago, (&s;ays he,) before the ferocity of the inhabitants of this part of the i&s;land was &s;ubdued, the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the civil law was nece&s;&s;ary, to re&s;train individuals from plundering each other. Thus, the man who intermeddled irregularly with the moveables of a per&s;on decea&s;ed, was &s;ubjected to all the debts of the decea&s;ed without limitation. This makes a branch of the law of Scotland, known by the name of <HI>vicious intro|mi&s;&s;ion;</HI> and &s;o rigidly was this regulation applied in our Courts of Law, that the mo&s;t trifling moveable ab&s;tracted <HI>mal&acirc; fide,</HI> &s;ubjected the intermeddler to the foregoing con&s;equences, which proved in many in&s;tances a mo&s;t rigo|rous puni&s;hment. But this &s;everity was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ubdue the undi&s;ciplined nature of our people. It is extremely remarkable, that in pro|portion to our improvement in manners, this regulation has been gradually &s;oftened, and applied by our &s;overeign Court with a &s;paring hand.'</Q></P>
<P>I find my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving, that this learned and judi|cious writer has not accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed the deficiencies and demands of the different conditions of human life, which, from a degree of &s;avagene&s;s and independence, in which all laws are vain, pa&s;&s;es or may pa&s;s, by innumerable gradations, to a &s;tate of reciprocal benignity, in which laws &s;hall be no longer nece&s;&s;ary. Men are fir&s;t wild and un&s;ocial, living each man to him&s;elf, taking
<PB N="385" REF="416">
from the weak, and lo&s;ing to the &s;trong. In their fir&s;t coalitions of &s;ociety, much of this original &s;avagene&s;s is retained. Of general happine&s;s, the product of general confidence, there is yet no thought. Men continue to pro&s;ecute their own advantages by the neare&s;t way; and the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the civil law is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train individuals from plundering each other. The re&s;traints then nece&s;&s;ary, are re&s;traints from plunder, from acts of publick violence, and undi&s;gui&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ion. The ferocity of our ance&s;tors, as of all other nations, produced not fraud but rapine. They had not yet learned to cheat, and attempted only to rob. As manners grow more poli&s;hed, with the knowledge of good, men attain likewi&s;e dexterity in evil. Open rapine becomes le&s;s frequent, and violence gives way to cunning. Tho&s;e who before invaded pa&s;tures and &s;tormed hou&s;es, now begin to enrich them&s;elves by unequal con|tracts and fraudulent intromi&s;&s;ions. It is not again&s;t the violence of ferocity, but the circumventions of deceit, that this law was framed; and I am afraid the increa&s;e of commerce, and the ince&s;&s;ant &s;truggle for riches which com|merce excites, give us no pro&s;pect of an end &s;peedily to be expected of artifice and fraud. It therefore &s;eems to be no very conclu&s;ive rea&s;oning, which connects tho&s;e two propo&s;itions;&mdash;'the nation is become le&s;s ferocious, and therefore the laws again&s;t fraud and <HI>coven</HI> &s;hall be relaxed.'</P>
<P>Whatever rea&s;on may have influenced the Judges to a relaxation of the law, it was not that the nation was grown le&s;s fierce; and, I am afraid, it cannot be affirmed that it is grown le&s;s fraudulent.</P>
<P>Since this law has been repre&s;ented as rigorou&s;ly and unrea&s;onably penal, it &s;eems not improper to con&s;ider what are the conditions and qualities that make the ju&s;tice or propriety of a penal law.</P>
<P>To make a penal law rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, two conditions are nece&s;&s;ary, and two proper. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the law &s;hould be adequate to its end; that, if it be ob&s;erved, it &s;hall prevent the evil again&s;t which it is directed. It is, &s;econdly, nece&s;&s;ary that the end of the law be of &s;uch importance, as to de&s;erve the &s;ecurity of a penal &s;anction. The other conditions of a penal law, which though not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, are to a very high degree fit, are, that to the moral violation of the law there are many temptations, and that of the phy&s;ical ob&s;ervance there is great facility.</P>
<P>All the&s;e conditions apparently concur to ju&s;tify the law which we are now con&s;idering. Its end is the &s;ecurity of property; and property very often of great value. The method by which it effects the &s;ecurity is effica|cious, becau&s;e it admits, in its original rigour, no gradations of injury; but keeps guilt and innocence apart, by a di&s;tinct and definite limitation. He
<PB N="386" REF="417"> that intromits, is criminal; he that intromits not, is innocent. Of the two &s;econdary con&s;iderations it cannot be denied that both are in our favour. The temptation to intromit is frequent and &s;trong; &s;o &s;trong and &s;o frequent, as to require the utmo&s;t activity of ju&s;tice, and vigilance of caution, to with&s;tand its prevalence; and the method by which a man may entitle him&s;elf to legal intromi&s;&s;ion is &s;o open and &s;o facile, that no neglect it is a proof of fraudulent intention: for why &s;hould a man omit to do (but for rea&s;ons which he will not confe&s;s,) that which he can do &s;o ea&s;ily, and that which he knows to be required by the law? If temptation were rare, a penal law might be deemed unnece&s;&s;ary. If the duty enjoined by the law were of difficult per|formance, omi&s;&s;ion, though it could not be ju&s;tified, might be pitied. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, neither equity nor compa&s;&s;ion operate again&s;t it. A u&s;eful, a nece&s;&s;ary law is broken, not only without a rea&s;onable motive, but with all the inducements to obedience that can be derived from &s;afety and facility.</P>
<P>I therefore return to my original po&s;ition, that a law, to have its effect, mu&s;t be permanent and &s;table. It may be &s;aid, in the language of the &s;chools, <HI>Lex non recepit majus et minus,</HI>&mdash;we may have a law, or we may have no law, but we cannot have half a law. We mu&s;t either have a rule of action, or be permitted to act by di&s;cretion and by chance. Deviations from the law mu&s;t be uniformly puni&s;hed, or no man can be certain when he &s;hall be &s;afe.</P>
<P>That from the rigour of the original in&s;titution this Court has &s;ometimes departed, cannot be denied. But, as it is evident that &s;uch deviations, as they make law uncertain, make life un&s;afe, I hope, that of departing from it there will now be an end; that the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors will be treated with due reverence; and that con&s;i&s;tent and &s;teady deci&s;ions will furni&s;h the people with a rule of action, and leave fraud and fraudulent intromi&s;&s;ion no future hope of impunity or e&s;cape.</P></Q>
<P>With &s;uch comprehen&s;ion of mind, and &s;uch clearne&s;s of penetration, did he thus treat a &s;ubject altogether new to him, without any other preparation than my having &s;tated to him the arguments which had been u&s;ed on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion. His intellectual powers appeared with peculiar lu&s;tre, when tried again&s;t tho&s;e of a writer of &s;o much fame as Lord Kames, and that too in his Lord&s;hip's own department.</P>
<P>This ma&s;terly argument, after being prefaced and concluded with &s;ome &s;entences of my own, and garni&s;hed with the u&s;ual formularies, was actually printed and laid before the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, but without &s;ucce&s;s. My re&s;pected friend Lord Hailes, however, one of that honourable body, had
<PB N="387" REF="418" MS="y">
critical &s;agacity enough to di&s;cover a more than ordinary hand in the <HI>Petition.</HI> I told him that Dr. John&s;on had favoured me with his pen. His Lord&s;hip, with wonderful <HI>acumen,</HI> pointed out exactly where his compo&s;ition began, and where it ended. But that I may do impartial ju&s;tice, and conform to the great rule of Courts, <HI>Suum cuique tribuito,</HI> I mu&s;t add, that their Lord&s;hips in general, though they were plea&s;ed to call this <Q REND="inline">"a well-drawn paper,"</Q> pre|ferred the former very inferiour petition which I had written; thus confirm|ing the truth of an ob&s;ervation made to me by one of their number, in a merry mood: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, give your&s;elf no trouble in the compo&s;ition of the papers you pre&s;ent to us; for, indeed, it is ca&s;ting pearls before &s;wine."</Q></P>
<P>I renewed my &s;olicitations that he would this year accompli&s;h his long-intended vi&s;it to Scotland.</P>

<P>I WAS much di&s;appointed that you did not come to Scotland la&s;t autumn. However, I mu&s;t own that your letter prevents me from complain|ing; not only becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible that the &s;tate of your health was but too good an excu&s;e, but becau&s;e you write in a &s;train which &s;hews that you have agreeable views of the &s;cheme which we have &s;o long propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>* * * * * *</P>
<P>I communicated to Beattie what you &s;aid of his book in your la&s;t letter to me. He writes to me thus: 'You judge very rightly in &s;uppo&s;ing that Dr. John&s;on's favourable opinion of my book mu&s;t give me great delight. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay how much I am gratified by it; for there is not a man upon earth who&s;e good opinion I would be more ambitious to cultivate. His talents and his virtues I reverence more than any words can expre&s;s. The extraordinary civilities, (the paternal attentions I &s;hould rather &s;ay,) and the many in&s;tructions I have had the honour to receive from him, will to me be a perpetual &s;ource of plea&s;ure in the recollection.

<P>'I had &s;till &s;ome thoughts, while the &s;ummer la&s;ted, of being obliged to go to London on &s;ome little bu&s;ine&s;s; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould certainly have troubled him with a letter &s;everal months ago, and given &s;ome vent to my gratitude and admiration. This I intend to do, as &s;oon as I am left a little at lei&s;ure. Mean time, if you have occa&s;ion to write to him, I beg you will offer him my mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments, and a&s;&s;ure him of the &s;incerity of my attachment and the warmth of my gratitude.'</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your kind letter much more than the elegant Pindar which it accompanied. I am always glad to find my&s;elf not forgotten, and to be forgotten by you would give me great unea&s;ine&s;s. My northern friends have never been unkind to me: I have from you, dear Sir, te&s;timonies of affection, which I have not often been able to excite; and Dr. Beattie rates the te&s;timony which I was de&s;irous of paying to his merit, much higher than I &s;hould have thought it rea&s;onable to expect.</P>
<P>I have heard of your ma&s;querade. What &s;ays your Synod to &s;uch inno|vations? I am not &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;crupulous, nor do I think a ma&s;querade either evil in it&s;elf, or very likely to be the occa&s;ion of evil; yet as the world thinks it a very licentious relaxation of manners, I would not have been one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ma&s;quers in a country where no ma&s;querade had ever been before <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">There had been ma&s;querades in Scotland before; but not for a very long time.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A new edition of my great Dictionary is printed, from a copy which I was per&s;uaded to revi&s;e; but having made no preparation, I was able to do very little. Some &s;uperfluities I have expunged, and &s;ome faults I have cor|rected, and here and there have &s;cattered a remark; but the main fabrick of the work remains as it was. I had looked very little into it &s;ince I wrote it, and, I think, I found it full as often better, as wor&s;e, than I expected.</P>
<P>Baretti and Davies have had a furious quarrel; a quarrel, I think, irre|concileable. Dr. Gold&s;mith has a new comedy, which is expected in the
<PB N="390" REF="421" MS="y">
 &s;pring. No name is yet given it. The chief diver&s;ion ari&s;es from a &s;tratagem by which a lover is made to mi&s;take his future father-in-law's hou&s;e for an inn. This, you &s;ee, borders upon farce. The dialogue is quick and gay&punc; and the incidents are &s;o prepared as not to &s;eem improbable.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that you lo&s;t your cau&s;e of Intromi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e I yet think the arguments on your &s;ide unan&s;werable. But you &s;eem, I think, to &s;ay that you gained reputation even by your defeat; and reputation you will daily gain, if you keep Lord Auchinleck's precept in your mind, and endeavour to con|&s;olidate in your mind a firm and regular &s;y&s;tem of law, in&s;tead of picking up occa&s;ional fragments.</P>
<P>My health &s;eems in general to improve; but I have been troubled for many weeks with a vexatious catarrh, which is &s;ometimes &s;ufficiently di&s;tre&s;sful. I have not found any great effects from bleeding and phy&s;ick; and am afraid, that I mu&s;t expect help from brighter days and &s;ofter air.</P>
<P>Write to me now and then; and whenever any good befalls you, make ha&s;te to let me know it, for no one will rejoice at it more than,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On Saturday, April 3, the day after my arrival in London this year, I went to his hou&s;e late in the evening, and &s;at with Mrs. Williams till he came home. I found in the London Chronicle, Dr. Gold&s;mith's apology to the publick for beating Evans, a book&s;eller, on account of a paragraph in a new&s;|paper publi&s;hed by him, which Gold&s;mith thought impertinent to him and to a lady of his acquaintance. The apology was written &s;o much in Dr. John&s;on's manner, that both Mrs. Williams and I &s;uppo&s;ed it to be his; but when he came home he &s;oon undeceived us. When he &s;aid to Mrs. Williams, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Dr. Gold&s;mith's <HI>manife&s;to</HI> has got into your paper;"</Q> I a&s;ked him if Dr. Gold&s;mith had written it, with an air that made him &s;ee I &s;u&s;pected it was his, though &s;ub&s;cribed by Gold&s;mith. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Dr. Gold&s;mith would no more have a&s;ked me to write &s;uch a thing as that for him, than he would have a&s;ked me to feed him with a &s;poon, or to do any thing el&s;e that denoted his imbecillity. I as much believe that he wrote it, as if I had &s;een him do it. Sir, had he &s;hewn it to any one friend, he would not have been allowed to publi&s;h it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a fooli&s;h thing well done. I &s;uppo&s;e he has been &s;o much elated with the &s;ucce&s;s of his new
<PB N="391" REF="422" MS="y">
comedy, that he has thought every thing that concerned him mu&s;t be of im|portance to the publick."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I fancy, Sir, this is the fir&s;t time that he has been engaged in &s;uch an adventure."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I believe it is the fir&s;t time he has <HI>beat;</HI> he may have <HI>been beaten</HI> before. This, Sir, is a new plume to him."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Sir John Dalrymple's <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs of Great-Britain and Ireland,"</Q> and his di&s;coveries to the prejudice of Lord Ru&s;&s;el and Algernon Sydney. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, every body who had ju&s;t notions of government thought them ra&s;cals before. It is well that all mankind now &s;ee them to be ra&s;cals."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, may not tho&s;e di&s;coveries be true without their being ra&s;cals."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Con&s;ider, Sir; would any of them have been willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France? Depend upon it, Sir, he who does what he is afraid &s;hould be known, has &s;omething rotten about him. This Dalrymple &s;eems to be an hone&s;t fellow; for he tells equally what makes again&s;t both &s;ides. But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing: it is the mere bouncing of a &s;chool-boy. Great He! but greater She! and &s;uch &s;tuff."</Q></P>
<P>I could not agree with him in this critici&s;m; for though Sir John Dalrymple's &s;tyle is not regularly formed in any re&s;pect, and one cannot help &s;miling &s;ome|times at his affected <HI>grandiloquence,</HI> there is in his writing a pointed vivacity, and much of a gentlemanly &s;pirit.</P>
<P>At Mr. Thrale's, in the evening, he repeated his u&s;ual paradoxical decla|mation again&s;t action in publick &s;peaking. <Q REND="inline">"Action can have no effect upon rea&s;onable minds. It may augment noi&s;e, but it never can enforce argument. If you &s;peak to a dog, you u&s;e action; you hold up your hand thus, becau&s;e he is a brute; and in proportion as men are removed from brutes, action will have the le&s;s influence upon them."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"What then, Sir, becomes of Demo&s;thenes's &s;aying? 'Action, action, action!"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Demo&s;thenes, Madam, &s;poke to an a&s;&s;embly of brutes; to a barbarous people."</Q></P>
<P>I thought it extraordinary, that he &s;hould deny the power of rhetorical action upon human nature, when it is proved by innumerable facts in all &s;tages of &s;ociety. Rea&s;onable beings are not &s;olely rea&s;onable. They have fancies which may be plea&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ions which may be rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lord Che&s;terfield being mentioned, John&s;on remarked, that almo&s;t all of that celebrated nobleman's witty &s;ayings were puns. He, however, allowed the merit of good wit to his Lord&s;hip's &s;aying of Lord Tyrawley and him&s;elf, when both very old and infirm: <Q REND="inline">"Tyrawley and I have been dead the&s;e two years; but we don't choo&s;e to have it known."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="423" MS="y"> He talked with approbation of an intended edition of <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator,"</Q> with notes; two volumes of which had been prepared by a gentleman eminent in the literary world, and the materials which he had collected for the remainder had been transferred to another hand. He ob&s;erved, that all works which de&s;cribe manners, require notes in &s;ixty or &s;eventy years, or le&s;s; and told us, he had communicated all he knew that could throw light upon <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Addi&s;on had made his Sir Andrew Freeport a true Whig, arguing again&s;t giving charity to beggars, and throwing out other &s;uch ungracious &s;entiments; but that he had thought better, and made amends by making him found an ho&s;pital for decayed farmers."</Q> He called for the volume of <Q REND="inline">"The Spectator"</Q> in which that account is contained, and read it aloud to us. He read &s;o well, that every thing acquired additional weight and grace from his utterance.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation having turned on modern imitations of ancient ballads, and &s;ome one having prai&s;ed their &s;implicity, he treated them with that ridi|cule which he always di&s;played when this &s;ubject was mentioned.</P>
<P>He di&s;approved of introducing &s;cripture phra&s;es into &s;ecular di&s;cour&s;e. This &s;eemed to me a que&s;tion of &s;ome difficulty. A &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, like a highly cla&s;&s;ical phra&s;e, to produce an in&s;tantaneous &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion; and it may be done without being at all improper. Yet I own there is danger, that applying the language of our &s;acred book to ordinary &s;ubjects may tend to le&s;&s;en our reverence for it. If therefore it be introduced at all, it &s;hould be with very great caution.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 8, I &s;at a good part of the evening with him, but he was very &s;ilent. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Burnet's Hi&s;tory of his own Times,' is very entertaining. The &s;tyle, indeed, is mere chit-chat. I do not believe that Burnet intentionally lyed; but he was &s;o much prejudiced, that he took no pains to find out the truth. He was like a man who re&s;olves to regulate his time by a certain watch; but will not inquire whether the watch is right or not."</Q></P>
<P>Though he was not di&s;po&s;ed to talk, he was unwilling that I &s;hould leave him; and when I looked at my watch, and told him it was twelve o'clock, he cried, <Q REND="inline">"What's that to you and me?"</Q> and ordered Frank to tell Mrs. Williams that we were coming to drink tea with her, which we did. It was &s;ettled that we &s;hould go to church together next day.</P>
<P>On the 9th of April, being Good Friday, I breakfa&s;ted with him on tea and cro&s;s-buns; <HI>Doctor</HI> Levet, as Frank called him, making the tea. He carried me with him to the church of St. Clement Danes, where he had his &s;eat; and
<PB N="393" REF="424">
his behaviour was, as I had imaged to my&s;elf, &s;olemnly devout. I never &s;hall forget the tremulous earne&s;tne&s;s with which he pronounced the aweful petition in the Litany: <Q REND="inline">"In the hour of death, and at the day of judgement, good LORD deliver us."</Q></P>
<P>We went to church both in the morning and evening. In the interval between the two &s;ervices we did not dine, but he read in the Greek New Te&s;tament, and I turned over &s;everal of his books.</P>
<P>In Archbi&s;hop Laud's Diary, I found the following pa&s;&s;age, which I read to Dr. John&s;on:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"1623. February 1, Sunday. I &s;tood by the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Prince Charles^3<NOTE PLACE="foot">^2 Afterwards Charles I.</NOTE>, at dinner. He was then very merry, and talked occa&s;ionally of many things with his attendants. Among other things, he &s;aid, that if he were nece&s;&s;itated to take any particular profe&s;&s;ion of life, he could not be a lawyer, adding his rea&s;ons: 'I cannot (&s;aith he,) defend a bad, nor yield in a good cau&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, this is fal&s;e rea&s;oning; becau&s;e every cau&s;e has a bad &s;ide: and a lawyer is not overcome, though the cau&s;e which he has endeavoured to &s;upport be determined again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P>I told him that Gold&s;mith had &s;aid to me a few days before, <Q REND="inline">"As I take my &s;hoes from the &s;hoemaker, and my coat from the taylor, &s;o I take my religion from the prie&s;t."</Q> I regretted this loo&s;e way of talking. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he knows nothing; he has made up his mind about nothing."</Q></P>
<P>To my great &s;urprize, he a&s;ked me to dine with him on Ea&s;ter-day. I never &s;uppo&s;ed that he had a dinner at his hou&s;e; for I had not then heard of any one of his friends having been entertained at his table. He told me, <Q REND="inline">"I generally have a meat pye on Sunday: it is baked at a publick oven, which is very properly allowed, becau&s;e one man can attend it; and thus the advan|tage is obtained of not keeping &s;ervants from church to dre&s;s dinners."</Q></P>
<P>April 11, being Ea&s;ter-Sunday, after having attended divine &s;ervice at St. Paul's, I repaired to Dr. John&s;on's. I had gratified my curio&s;ity much in dining with JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU, while he lived in the wilds of Neuf|chatel: I had as great a curio&s;ity to dine with DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in the du&s;ky rece&s;s of a court in Fleet-&s;treet. I &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould &s;carcely have knives and forks, and only &s;ome &s;trange uncouth ill-dre&s;t di&s;h: but I found every thing in very good order. We had no other company but Mrs. Williams and a young woman whom I did not know. As a dinner here was con&s;idered as a &s;ingular phaenomenon, and as I was frequently interrogated on the &s;ubject, my
<PB N="394" REF="425" MS="y">
 readers may perhaps be de&s;irous to know our bill of fare. Foote, I remember, in allu&s;ion to Francis, the <HI>negro,</HI> was willing to &s;uppo&s;e that our repa&s;t was <HI>black broth.</HI> But the fact was, that we had a very good &s;oup, a boiled leg of lamb and &s;pinach, a veal pye, and a rice pudding.</P>
<P>Of Dr. John Campbell, the authour, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He is a very inqui&s;itive and a very able man, and a man of good religious principles, though I am afraid he has been deficient in practice. Campbell is radically right; and we may hope, that in time there will be good practice."</Q></P>
<P>He owned that he thought Hawke&s;worth was one of his imitators, but he did not think Gold&s;mith was. Gold&s;mith, he &s;aid, had great merit. BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting &s;o high in the publick e&s;timation."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, he has, perhaps, got <HI>&s;ooner</HI> to it by his intimacy with me."</Q></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith, though his vanity often excited him to occa&s;ional competition, had a very high regard for John&s;on, which he at this time expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t manner in the Dedication of his comedy, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"She &s;toops to conquer <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"By in&s;cribing this &s;light performance to you, I do not mean &s;o much to compliment you, as my&s;elf. It may do me &s;ome honour to inform the publick, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may &s;erve the intere&s;ts of mankind al&s;o to inform them, that the greate&s;t wit may be found in a character, without impairing the mo&s;t unaffected piety."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on ob&s;erved, that there were very few books printed in Scotland before the Union. He had &s;een a complete collection of them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, a nonjuring Bi&s;hop <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"By in&s;cribing this &s;light performance to you, I do not mean &s;o much to compliment you, as my&s;elf. It may do me &s;ome honour to inform the publick, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may &s;erve the intere&s;ts of mankind al&s;o to inform them, that the greate&s;t wit may be found in a character, without impairing the mo&s;t unaffected piety."</Q></NOTE>. I wi&s;h this collection had been kept entire. Many of them are in the library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh. I told Dr. John&s;on that I had &s;ome intention to write the life of the learned and worthy Thomas Ruddiman. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould take plea&s;ure in helping you to do honour to him. But his farewell letter to the Faculty of Advocates, when he re&s;igned the office of their Librarian, &s;hould have been in Latin."</Q></P>
<P>I put a que&s;tion to him upon a fact in common life, which he could not an&s;wer, nor have I found any one el&s;e who could. What is the rea&s;on that women &s;ervants, though obliged to be at the expence of purcha&s;ing their own clothes, have much lower wages than men &s;ervants, to whom a great propor|tion of that article is furni&s;hed, and when in fact our female hou&s;e &s;ervants work much harder than the male? <NOTE PLACE="foot">5 See an account of this learned and re&s;pectable gentleman, and of his curious work on the <HI>Middle State,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 371.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="426" MS="y">
He told me, that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a journal of his life, but never could per&s;evere. He advi&s;ed me to do it. <Q REND="inline">"The great thing to be recorded, (&s;aid he,) is the &s;tate of your own mind; and you &s;hould write down every thing that you remember, for you cannot judge at fir&s;t what is good or bad; and write immediately while the impre&s;&s;ion is fre&s;h, for it will not be the &s;ame a week afterwards."</Q></P>
<P>I again &s;olicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early years. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You &s;hall have them all for two-pence. I hope you &s;hall know a great deal more of me before you write my Life."</Q> He mentioned to me this day many circum&s;tances, which I wrote down when I went home, and have interwoven in the former part of this narrative.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, April 13, he and Dr. Gold&s;mith and I dined at General Ogle|thorpe's. Gold&s;mith expatiated on the common topick, that the race of our peo|ple was degenerated, and that this was owing to luxury. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, in the fir&s;t place, I doubt the fact. I believe there are as many tall men in England now, as ever there were. But, &s;econdly, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tature of our people to be dimini&s;hed, that is not owing to luxury; for, Sir, con&s;ider to how very &s;mall a proportion of our people luxury can reach. Our &s;oldiery, &s;urely, are not luxurious, who live on &s;ix-pence a day; and the &s;ame remark will apply to almo&s;t all the other cla&s;&s;es. Luxury, &s;o far as it reaches the poor, will do good to the race of people: it will &s;trengthen and multiply them. Sir, no nation was ever hurt by luxury; for, as I &s;aid before, it can reach but to a very few. I admit that the great increa&s;e of commerce and manufactures hurts the military &s;pirit of a people; becau&s;e it produces a competition for &s;omething el&s;e than martial honours,&mdash;a competition for riches. It al&s;o hurts the bodies of the people; for you will ob&s;erve, there is no man who works at any particular trade, but you may know him from his appearance to do &s;o. One part or other of his body being more u&s;ed than the re&s;t, he is in &s;ome degree deformed: but, Sir, that is not luxury. A tailor &s;its cro&s;s-legged; but that is not luxury."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Come, you're ju&s;t going to the &s;ame place by another road."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I &s;ay that is not <HI>luxury.</HI> Let us take a walk from Charing-cro&s;s to Whitechapel, through, I &s;uppo&s;e, the greate&s;t &s;eries of &s;hops in the world, what is there is any of the&s;e &s;hops, (if you except gin-&s;hops,) that can do any human being any harm?"</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, I'll accept your challenge. The very next &s;hop to Northumber|land-hou&s;e is a pickle-&s;hop."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir: do we not know that a maid can in one afternoon make pickles &s;ufficient to &s;erve a whole family for a year? nay, that five pickle-&s;hops can &s;erve all the kingdom? Be&s;ides,
<PB N="396" REF="427" MS="y"> Sir, there is no harm done to any body by the making of pickles, or the eat|ing of pickles."</Q></P>
<P>We drank tea with the ladies; and Gold&s;mith &s;ung Tony Lumpkin's &s;ong in his comedy, <Q REND="inline">"She &s;toops to conquer,"</Q> and a very pretty one, to an Iri&s;h tune, which he had de&s;igned for Mi&s;s Hardca&s;tle; but as Mrs. Bulkeley, who played the part, could not &s;ing, it was left out. He afterwards wrote it down for me, by which means it was pre&s;erved, and now appears among&s;t his poems. Dr. John&s;on, in his way home, &s;topt at my lodgings in Piccadilly, and &s;at with me, drinking tea a &s;econd time, till a late hour.</P>
<P>I told him that Mrs. Macaulay &s;aid, &s;he wondered how he could reconcile his political principles with his moral; his notions of inequality and &s;ubordi|nation with wi&s;hing well to the happine&s;s of all mankind, who might live &s;o agreeably, had they all their portions of land, and none to domineer over another. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I reconcile my principles very well, becau&s;e mankind are happier in a &s;tate of inequality and &s;ubordination. Were they to be in this pretty &s;tate of equality, they would &s;oon degenerate into brutes;&mdash;they would become Monboddo's nation;&mdash;their tails would grow. Sir, all would be lo&s;ers, were all to work to all:&mdash;they would have no intellectual improvement. All intellectual improvement ari&s;es from lei&s;ure: all lei&s;ure ari&s;es from one working for another."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of the family of Stuart, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It &s;hould &s;eem that the family at pre&s;ent on the throne has now e&s;tabli&s;hed as good a right as the former family, by the long con&s;ent of the people; and that to di&s;turb this right might be con&s;idered as culpable. At the &s;ame time I own, that it is a very difficult que&s;tion, when con&s;idered with re&s;pect to the hou&s;e of Stuart. To oblige people to take oaths as to the di&s;puted right, is wrong. I know not whether I could take them: but I do not blame tho&s;e who do."</Q> So con&s;cientious and &s;o delicate was he upon this &s;ubject, which has occa&s;ioned &s;o much clamour again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Talking of law ca&s;es, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The Engli&s;h reports, in general, are very poor: only the half of what has been &s;aid is taken down; and of that half, much is mi&s;taken. Whereas, in Scotland, the arguments on each &s;ide are deliberately put in writing, to be con&s;idered by the Court. I think a collec|tion of your ca&s;es upon &s;ubjects of importance, with the opinions of the Judges upon them, would be valuable."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 15, I dined with him and Dr. Gold&s;mith at General Paoli's. We found here, Signor Martinelli, of Florence, authour of a Hi&s;tory of England in Italian, printed at London.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="428" MS="y">
I &s;poke of Allan Ram&s;ay's <Q REND="inline">"Gentle Shepherd,"</Q> in the Scotti&s;h dialect, as the be&s;t pa&s;toral that had ever been written; not only abounding with beauti|ful rural imagery, and ju&s;t and plea&s;ing &s;entiments, but being a real picture of manners; and I offered to teach Dr. John&s;on to under&s;tand it. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, (&s;aid he,) I won't learn it. You &s;hall retain your &s;uperiority by my not knowing it."</Q></P>
<P>This brought on a que&s;tion whether one man is le&s;&s;ened by another's acquiring an equal degree of knowledge with him. John&s;on a&s;&s;erted the affirmative. I maintained that the po&s;ition might be true in tho&s;e kinds of knowledge which produce wi&s;dom, power, and force, &s;o as to enable one man to have the government of others; but that a man is not in any degree le&s;|&s;ened by others knowing as well as he what ends in mere plea&s;ure:&mdash;eating fine fruits, drinking delicious wines, reading exqui&s;ite poetry.</P>
<P>The General ob&s;erved, that Martinelli was a Whig. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it. It &s;hews the &s;pirit of the times: he is obliged to tempori&s;e."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I rather think, Sir, that Toryi&s;m prevails in this reign."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I know not why you &s;hould think &s;o, Sir. You &s;ee your friend Lord Lyttelton, a nobleman, is obliged in his Hi&s;tory to write the mo&s;t vulgar Whiggi&s;m."</Q></P>
<P>An animated debate took place whether Martinelli &s;hould continue his Hi&s;tory of England to the pre&s;ent day. GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure he &s;hould."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; he would give great offence. He would have to tell of almo&s;t all the living great what they do not wi&s;h told."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"It may, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary for a native to be more cautious; but a foreigner who comes among us without prejudice, may be con&s;idered as holding the place of a Judge, and may &s;peak his mind freely."</Q> JOHNSON&punc; <Q REND="inline">"Sir, a foreigner, when he &s;ends a work from the pre&s;s, ought to be on his guard again&s;t catching the errour and mi&s;taken enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people among whom he happens to be."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he wants only to &s;ell his hi&s;tory, and tell truth; one an hone&s;t, the other a laudable motive."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they are both laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wi&s;h to live by his labours; but he &s;hould write &s;o as he may <HI>live</HI> by them, not &s;o as he may be knocked on the head. I would advi&s;e him to be at Calais before he publi&s;hes his hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent age. A foreigner who attaches him&s;elf to a political party in this country, is in the wor&s;t &s;tate that can be imagined: he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it from intere&s;t."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Or principle."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely,
<PB N="398" REF="429">
 then, one may tell truth with &s;afety."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, in the fir&s;t place, he who tells a hundred lies has di&s;armed the force of his lies. But be&s;ides; a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him, than one truth which he does not wi&s;h &s;hould be told."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"For my part, I'd tell truth, and &s;hame the devil."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but the devil will be angry. I wi&s;h to &s;hame the devil as much as you do; but I &s;hould choo&s;e to be out of the reach of his claws."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"His claws can do you no harm, when you have the &s;hield of truth."</Q></P>
<P>It having been ob&s;erved that there was little ho&s;pitality in London; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, any man who has a name, or who has the power of plea&s;ing, will be very generally invited in London. The man, Sterne, I have been told, has had engagements for three months."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"And a very dull fellow."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why no, Sir."</Q></P>
<P>Martinelli told us, that for &s;everal years he lived much with Charles Town&s;hend, and that he ventured to tell him he was a bad joker. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, thus much I can &s;ay upon the &s;ubject. One day he and a few more agreed to go and dine in the country, and each of them was to bring a a friend in his carriage with him. Charles Town&s;hend a&s;ked Fitzherbert to go with him, but told him, 'You mu&s;t find &s;omebody to bring you back: I can only carry you there.' Fitzherbert did not much like this arrangement. He however con&s;ented, ob&s;erving &s;arca&s;tically, 'It will do very well; for then the &s;ame jokes will &s;erve you in returning as in going."</Q></P>
<P>An eminent publick character being mentioned;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I remember being pre&s;ent when he &s;hewed him&s;elf to be &s;o corrupted, or at lea&s;t &s;omething &s;o different from what I think right, as to maintain, that a member of parlia|ment &s;hould go along with his party right or wrong. Now, Sir, this is &s;o remote from native virtue, from &s;chola&s;tick virtue, that a good man mu&s;t have undergone a great change before he can reconcile him&s;elf to &s;uch a doctrine. It is maintaining, that you may lie to the publick; for you lie when you call that right which you think wrong, or the rever&s;e. A friend of ours, who is too much an echo of that gentleman, ob&s;erved, that a man who does not &s;tick uniformly to a party, is only waiting to be bought. Why then, &s;aid I, he is only waiting to be what that gentleman is already."</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the King's coming to &s;ee Gold&s;mith's new play.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h he would,"</Q> &s;aid Gold&s;mith; adding, however, with an affected indifference, <Q REND="inline">"Not that it would do me the lea&s;t good."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Well then, Sir, let us &s;ay it would do <HI>him</HI> good, (laughing.) No, Sir, this affectation will not pa&s;s;&mdash;it is mighty idle. In &s;uch a &s;tate as ours, who would not wi&s;h to

plea&s;e the chief magi&s;trate?"</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>do</HI> wi&s;h to plea&s;e him. I remember a line in Dryden,
<Q><L>'And ev'ry poet is the Monarch's friend.'</L></Q>
It ought to be rever&s;ed."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, there are finer lines in Dryden on this &s;ubject:
<Q><L>'For colleges on bounteous Kings depend,</L>
<L>'And never rebel was to arts a friend."</L></Q></Q>
General Paoli ob&s;erved, that &s;ucce&s;sful rebels might. MARTINELLI. <Q REND="inline">"Happy rebellions."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"We have no &s;uch phra&s;e."</Q> GENERAL PAOLI. <Q REND="inline">"But have you not the <HI>thing?"</HI></Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Yes; all our <HI>happy</HI> revo|lutions. They have hurt our con&s;titution, and will hurt it, till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION."</Q>&mdash;I never before di&s;covered that my friend Gold&s;mith had &s;o much of the old prejudice in him.</P>
<P>General Paoli, talking of Gold&s;mith's new play, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Il a fait un com|pliment tr&egrave;s gracieux &agrave; une certaine grande dame;"</HI></Q> meaning a Duche&s;s of the fir&s;t rank.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed a doubt whether Gold&s;mith intended it, in order that I might hear the truth from him&s;elf. It, perhaps, was not quite fair to endeavour to bring him to a confe&s;&s;ion, as he might not wi&s;h to avow po&s;itively his taking part again&s;t the Court. He &s;miled and he&s;itated. The General at once relieved him, by this beautiful image: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Mon&s;ieur Gold&s;mith e&s;t comme la mer qui jette des perles et beaucoup d'autres belles cho&s;es, &s;ans s'en appercevoir."</HI></Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Tr&egrave;s bien dit, et tr&egrave;s &eacute;l&eacute;gamment."</HI></Q></P>
<P>A per&s;on was mentioned, who it was &s;aid could take down in &s;hort hand the &s;peeches in parliament with perfect exactne&s;s. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is impo&s;|&s;ible. I remember one Angel, who came to me to write for him a Preface or Dedication to a book upon &s;hort hand, and he profe&s;&s;ed to write as fa&s;t as a man could &s;peak. In order to try him, I took down a book, and read while he wrote; and I favoured him, for I read more deliberately than u&s;ual. I had proceeded but a very little way, when he begged I would de&s;i&s;t, for he could not follow me."</Q> Hearing now for the fir&s;t time of this Preface or Dedication, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What an expence, Sir, do you put us to in buying books, to which you have written Prefaces or Dedications."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why I have dedi|cated to the Royal Family all round; that is to &s;ay, to the la&s;t generation of the Royal Family."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"And perhaps, Sir, not one &s;entence of wit
<PB N="400" REF="431"> in a whole Dedication."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Perhaps not, Sir."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"What then is the rea&s;on for applying to a particular per&s;on to do that which any one may do as well?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, one man has greater readine&s;s at doing it than another."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;poke of Mr. Harris, of Sali&s;bury, as being a very learned man, and in particular an eminent Grecian. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I am not &s;ure of that. His friends give him out as &s;uch, but I know not who of his friends are able to judge of it."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"He is what is much better: he is a worthy humane man."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, that is not to the purpo&s;e of our argument: that will as much prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"The greate&s;t mu&s;ical performers have but &s;mall emoluments. Giardini, I am told, does not get above &s;even hundred a year."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is, indeed, but little for a man to get, who does be&s;t that which &s;o many endeavour to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is &s;hewn &s;o much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other things we can do &s;omething at fir&s;t. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not &s;o well as a &s;mith, but tolerably. A man will &s;aw a piece of wood, and make a box, though a clum&s;y one; but give him a fiddle and a fiddle-&s;tick, and he can do nothing."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, April 19, he called on me with Mrs. Williams, in Mr. Strahan's coach, and carried me out to dine with Mr. Elphin&s;ton, at his academy at Ken&s;ington. A printer having acquired a fortune &s;ufficient to keep his coach, was a good topick for the credit of literature. Mrs. Williams &s;aid, that another printer, Mr. Hamilton, had not waited &s;o long as Mr. Strahan, but had kept his coach &s;everal years &s;ooner. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He was in the right. Life is &s;hort. The &s;ooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Elphin&s;ton talked of a new book that was much admired, and a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on if he had read it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I have looked into it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What (&s;aid Elphin&s;ton,) have you not read it through?"</Q> John&s;on, offended at being thus pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;o obliged to own his cur&s;ory mode of reading, an&s;wered tartly, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; do <HI>you</HI> read books <HI>through?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>He this day again defended duelling, and put his argument upon what I have ever thought the mo&s;t &s;olid ba&s;is; that if publick war be allowed to be con&s;i&s;tent with morality, private war mu&s;t be equally &s;o. Indeed we may ob&s;erve what &s;trained arguments are u&s;ed, to reconcile war with the Chri&s;tian religion. But, in my opinion, it is exceedingly clear that duelling having better rea&s;ons for its barbarous violence, is more ju&s;tifiable than war, in
<PB N="401" REF="432" MS="y">
which thou&s;ands go forth without any cau&s;e of per&s;onal quarrel, and ma&s;&s;acre each other.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 21, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's. A gentle|man attacked Garrick for being vain. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No wonder, Sir, that he is vain; a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be con|ceived. So many bellows have blown the fire, that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;uch bellows too. Lord Mansfield with his cheeks like to bur&s;t: Lord Chatham like an Aeolus. I have read &s;uch notes from them to him as were enough to turn his head."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"True. When he whom every body el&s;e flatters, flatters me, I then am truly happy."</Q> MRS. THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"The &s;entiment is in Congreve, I think."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, in 'The Way of the World:'
<Q><L>'If there's delight in love, 'tis when I &s;ee</L>
<L>'That heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.'</L></Q>
No, Sir, I &s;hould not be &s;urprized though Garrick chained the ocean, and la&s;hed the winds."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Should it not be, Sir, la&s;hed the ocean and chained the winds?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; recollect the original:<Q><LG>
<L>'In Corum atque Eurum &s;olitus &s;aevire flagellis</L>
<L>'Barbarus, Aeolio nunquam hoc in carcere pa&s;&s;os,</L>
<L>'Ip&s;um compedibus qui vinxerat Euno&s;igaeum."</L>
</LG></Q></Q></P>
<P>This does very well, when both the winds and the &s;ea are per&s;onified, and mentioned by their mythological names, as in Juvenal; but when they are men|tioned in plain language, the application of the epithets &s;ugge&s;ted by me, is the mo&s;t obvious; and accordingly my friend him&s;elf, in his imitation of the pa&s;&s;age which de&s;cribes Xerxes, has
<Q><L>"The waves he la&s;hes, and enchains the wind."</L></Q></P>
<P>The modes of living in different countries, and the various views with which men travel in que&s;t of new &s;cenes, having been talked of, a learned gentleman who holds a con&s;iderable office in the law, expatiated on the happine&s;s of a &s;avage life; and mentioned an in&s;tance of an officer who had actually lived for &s;ome time in the wilds of America, of whom, when in that &s;tate, he quoted this reflection with an air of admiration, as if it had been deeply philo&s;o|phical: <Q REND="inline">"Here am I, free and unre&s;trained, amid&s;t the rude magnificence of Nature, with this Indian woman by my &s;ide, and this gun, with which I can
<PB N="402" REF="433" MS="y"> procure food when I want it: what more can be de&s;ired for human happi|ne&s;s?"</Q> It did not require much &s;agacity to fore&s;ee that &s;uch a &s;entiment would not be permitted to pa&s;s without due animadver&s;ion. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Do not allow your&s;elf, Sir, to be impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch gro&s;s ab&s;urdity. It is &s;ad &s;tuff; it is bruti&s;h. If a bull could &s;peak, he might as well exclaim,&mdash;Here am I with this cow and this gra&s;s; what being can enjoy greater felicity?"</Q></P>
<P>We talked of the melancholy end of a gentleman who had de&s;troyed him|&s;elf. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It was owing to imaginary difficulties in his affairs, which, had he talked with any friend, would &s;oon have vani&s;hed."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that all who commit &s;uicide are mad?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they are often not univer&s;ally di&s;ordered in their intellects, but one pa&s;&s;ion pre&s;&s;es &s;o upon them that they yield to it, and commit &s;uicide, as a pa&s;&s;ionate man will &s;tab another."</Q> He added, <Q REND="inline">"I have often thought, that after a man has taken the re&s;olution to kill him&s;elf, it is not courage in him to do any thing, however de&s;perate, becau&s;e he has nothing to fear."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"I don't &s;ee that."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay but, my dear Sir, why &s;hould not you &s;ee what every one el&s;e &s;ees?"</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"It is for fear of &s;omething that he has re&s;olved to kill him&s;elf; and will not that timid di&s;po&s;ition re&s;train him?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It does not &s;ignify that the fear of &s;omething made him re&s;olve; it is upon the &s;tate of his mind after the re&s;olution is taken, that I argue. Suppo&s;e a man, either from fear, or pride, or con&s;cience, or whatever motive, has re&s;olved to kill him&s;elf; when once the re&s;olution is taken, he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by the no&s;e, at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack, who is re&s;olved to kill him&s;elf. When Eu&s;tace Budgel was walking down to the Thames deter|mined to drown him&s;elf, he might, if he plea&s;ed, without any apprehen&s;ion of danger, have turned a&s;ide, and fir&s;t &s;et fire to St. James's palace."</Q></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, April 27, Mr. Beauclerk and I called on him in the morning. As we walked up John&s;on's-court, I &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have a veneration for this court;"</Q> and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the &s;ame reverential enthu&s;ia&s;m. We found him alone. We talked of Mr. Andrew Stuart's elegant and plau&s;ible Letters to Lord Mansfield; a copy of which had been &s;ent by the authour to Dr. John&s;on. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"They have not an&s;wered the end. They have not been talked of: I have never heard of them. This is owing to their not being &s;old. People &s;eldom read a book which is given to them; and few are given. The way to &s;pread a work is to &s;ell it at a low price. No man will &s;end to buy a thing that co&s;ts even &s;ix-pence, without an intention to read it."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"May it not be doubted, Sir, whether it be proper to
<PB N="403" REF="434">
publi&s;h letters, arraigning the ultimate deci&s;ion of an important cau&s;e by the &s;upreme judicature of the nation?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I do not think it was wrong to publi&s;h the&s;e letters. If they are thought to do harm, why not an&s;wer them? But they will do no harm. If Mr. Douglas be indeed the &s;on of Lady Jane, he cannot be hurt: if he be not her &s;on, and yet has the great e&s;tate of the family of Douglas, he may well &s;ubmit to have a pamphlet again&s;t him by Andrew Stuart. Sir, I think &s;uch a publication does good, as it does good to &s;hew us the po&s;&s;ibilities of human life. And, Sir, you will not &s;ay that the Douglas cau&s;e was a cau&s;e of ea&s;y deci&s;ion, when it divided your Court as much as it could do, to be determined at all. When your Judges were &s;even and &s;even, the ca&s;ting vote of the Pre&s;ident mu&s;t be given on one &s;ide or other; no matter, for my argument, on which; one or the other <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be taken; as when I am to move, there is no matter which leg I move fir&s;t. And then, Sir, it was otherwi&s;e determined here. No, Sir, a more dubious determination of any que&s;tion cannot be imagined <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">I regretted that Dr. John&s;on never took the trouble to &s;tudy a que&s;tion which intere&s;ted nations. He would not even read a pamphlet which I wrote upon it, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The E&s;&s;ence of the Douglas Cau&s;e,"</Q> which, I have rea&s;on to flatter my&s;elf, had con&s;iderable effect in favour of Mr. Douglas; of who&s;e legitimate filiation I was then, and am &s;till, firmly convinced. Let me add, that no fact can be more re&s;pectably a&s;certained, than by a judgement of the mo&s;t augu&s;t tribunal in the world; a judgement, in which Lord Mansfield and Lord Camden united in 1769, and from which only five of a numerous body entered a prote&s;t.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Gold&s;mith &s;hould not be for ever attempting to &s;hine in conver|&s;ation: he has not temper for it, he is &s;o much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is compo&s;ed partly of &s;kill, partly of chance. A man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Gold|&s;mith's putting him&s;elf again&s;t another, is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot &s;pare the hundred. It is not worth a man's while. A man &s;hould not lay a hundred to one, unle&s;s he can ea&s;ily &s;pare it, though he has a hundred chances for him: he can get but a guinea, and he may lo&s;e a hundred. Gold&s;mith is in this &s;tate. When he contends, if he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation: if he does not get the better, he is mi&s;erably vexed."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on's own &s;uperlative power of wit &s;et him above any ri&s;k of &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s. Garrick had remarked to me of him, a few days before, <Q REND="inline">"Rabe|lais and all other wits are nothing compared with him. You may be diverted by them; but John&s;on gives you a forcible hug, and &s;hakes laughter out of you, whether you will or no."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="435"> Gold&s;mith, however, was often very fortunate in his witty conte&s;ts, even when he entered the li&s;ts with John&s;on him&s;elf. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds was in company with them one day, when Gold&s;mith &s;aid, that he thought he could write a good fable, mentioned the &s;implicity which that kind of compo&s;ition requires, and ob&s;erved, that in mo&s;t fables the animals introduced &s;eldom talk in character. <Q REND="inline">"For in&s;tance, (&s;aid he,) the fable of the little fi&s;hes, who &s;aw birds fly over their heads, and envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds. The &s;kill (continued he,) con&s;i&s;ts in making them talk like little fi&s;hes."</Q> While he indulged him&s;elf in this fanciful reverie, he ob&s;erved John&s;on &s;haking his &s;ides, and laughing. Upon which he &s;martly proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Dr. John&s;on, this is not &s;o ea&s;y as you &s;eem to think; for if you were to make little fi&s;hes talk, they would talk like WHALES."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on, though remarkable for his great variety of compo&s;ition, never exerci&s;ed his talents in fable, except we allow his beautiful tale publi&s;hed in Mrs. Williams's Mi&s;cellanies to be of that &s;pecies. I have, however, found among his manu&s;cript collections the following &s;ketch of one:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Glow-worm lying in the garden &s;aw a candle in a neighbouring palace,&mdash;and complained of the littlene&s;s of his own light;&mdash;another ob&s;erved&mdash;wait a little;&mdash;&s;oon dark;&mdash;have outla&s;ted <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>[many]</HI> of the&s;e glaring lights which only are brighter as they ha&s;te to nothing."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 29, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, where were Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Dr. Gold&s;mith, and Mr. Thrale. I was very de&s;irous to get Dr. John&s;on ab&s;olutely fixed in his re&s;olution to go with me to the Hebrides this year; and I told him that I had received a letter from Dr. Robert&s;on the hi&s;torian upon the &s;ubject, with which he was much plea&s;ed, and now talked in &s;uch a manner of his long-intended tour, that I was &s;atisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of eating dogs at Otaheite being mentioned, Gold&s;mith ob&s;erved, that this was al&s;o a cu&s;tom in China; that a dog-butcher is as com|mon there as any other butcher; and that when he walks abroad all the dogs fall on him. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is not owing to his killing dogs, Sir. I remember a butcher at Lichfield, whom a dog that was in the hou&s;e where I lived, always attacked. It is the &s;mell of carnage which provokes this, let the animals he has killed be what they may."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, there is a general abhorrence in animals at the &s;igns of ma&s;&s;acre. If you put a tub full of blood into a &s;table, the hor&s;es are like to go mad."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I doubt that."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is a fact well authenticated."</Q> THRALE. <Q REND="inline">"You had better prove it before you put it into your book on natural hi&s;tory.
<PB N="405" REF="436">
You may do it in my &s;table if you will."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I would not have him prove it. If he is content to take his information from others, he may get through his book with little trouble, and without much endanger|ing his reputation. But if he makes experiments for &s;o comprehen&s;ive a book as his, there would be no end to them; his erroneous a&s;&s;ertions would then fall upon him&s;elf; and he might be blamed for not having made experiments as to every particular."</Q></P>
<P>The character of Mallet having been introduced, and &s;poken of &s;lightingly by Gold&s;mith; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, Mallet had talents enough to keep his lite|rary reputation alive as long as he him&s;elf lived; and that, let me tell you, is a good deal."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"But I cannot agree that it was &s;o. His literary reputation was dead long before his natural death. I con&s;ider an authour's lite|rary reputation to be alive only while his name will en&s;ure a good price for his copy from the book&s;ellers. I will get you (to John&s;on,) a hundred guineas for any thing whatever that you &s;hall write, if you put your name to it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith's new play, <Q REND="inline">"She &s;toops to conquer,"</Q> being mentioned; JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I know of no comedy for many years that has &s;o much exhila|rated an audience, that has an&s;wered &s;o much the great end of comedy,&mdash;making an audience merry."</Q></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith having &s;aid, that Garrick's compliment to the Queen, which he introduced into the play of 'The Chances,' which he had altered and revi&s;ed this year, was mean and gro&s;s flattery;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, I would not <HI>write,</HI> I would not give &s;olemnly under my hand a character beyond what I thought really true; but a &s;peech on the &s;tage, let it flatter ever &s;o extrava|gantly, is formular. It has always been formular to flatter Kings and Queens; &s;o much &s;o, that even in our church-&s;ervice we have 'our mo&s;t religious King,' u&s;ed indi&s;criminately, whoever is King. Nay, they even flatter them|&s;elves;&mdash;'we have been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant.'&mdash;No modern flattery, how|ever, is &s;o gro&s;s as that of the Augu&s;tan age, where the Emperour was deified. <HI>'Prae&s;ens Divus habebitur Augu&s;tus.'</HI> And as to meanne&s;s, (ri&s;ing into warmth,) how is it mean in a player,&mdash;a &s;howman,&mdash;a fellow who exhibits him&s;elf for a &s;hilling, to flatter his Queen? The attempt, indeed, was dangerous; for if it had mi&s;&s;ed, what became of Garrick, and what became of the Queen? As Sir William Temple &s;ays of a great General, it is nece&s;&s;ary not only that his de&s;igns &s;hould be formed in a ma&s;terly manner, but that they &s;hould be attended with &s;ucce&s;s. Sir, it is right, at a time when the Royal Family is not generally liked, to let it be &s;een that the people like at lea&s;t one of them."</Q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"I do not perceive why the profe&s;&s;ion of a
<PB N="406" REF="437" MS="y"> player &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed; for the great and ultimate end of all the employ|ments of mankind is to produce amu&s;ement. Garrick produces more amu&s;e|ment than any body."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"You &s;ay, Dr. John&s;on, that Garrick exhibits him&s;elf for a &s;hilling. In this re&s;pect he is only on a footing with a lawyer who exhibits him&s;elf for his fee, and even will maintain any non&s;en&s;e or ab&s;urdity, if the ca&s;e requires it. Garrick refu&s;es a play or a part which he does not like; a lawyer never refu&s;es."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, what does this prove? only that a lawyer is wor&s;e. Bo&s;well is now like Jack in 'The Tale of a Tub,' who, when he is puzzled by an argument, hangs him&s;elf. He thinks I &s;hall cut him down, but I'll let him hang,"</Q> (laughing vociferou&s;ly.) SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Bo&s;well thinks that the profe&s;&s;ion of a lawyer being unque&s;tionably honourable, if he can &s;hew the profe&s;&s;ion of a player to be more honourable, he proves his argument."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, April 30, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk's, where were Lord Charlemont, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, and &s;ome more members of the Literary Club, whom he had obligingly invited to meet me, as I was this evening to be balloted for as candidate for admi&s;&s;ion into that di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ociety. John&s;on had done me the honour to propo&s;e me, and Beauclerk was very zealous for me.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith being mentioned;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"It is amazing how little Gold&s;mith knows. He &s;eldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one el&s;e."</Q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <Q REND="inline">"Yet there is no man who&s;e company is more liked."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir. When people find a man of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities as a writer, their inferiour while he is with them, it mu&s;t be highly gratifying to them. What Gold&s;mith comically &s;ays of him&s;elf is very true,&mdash;he always gets the better when he argues alone;&mdash;meaning, that he is ma&s;ter of a &s;ubject in his &s;tudy, and can write well upon it; but when he comes into company, grows confu&s;ed, and unable to talk. Take him as a poet, his 'Traveller' is a very fine performance; aye, and &s;o is his 'De&s;erted Village,' were it not &s;ometimes too much the echo of his 'Traveller.' Whether, indeed, we take him as a poet,&mdash;as a comick writer,&mdash;or as an hi&s;torian, he &s;tands in the fir&s;t cla&s;s."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"An hi&s;torian! My dear Sir, you &s;urely will not rank his compilation of the Roman Hi&s;tory with the works of other hi&s;torians of this age?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, who are before him?"</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Hume,&mdash;Robert&s;on,&mdash;Lord Lyttelton."</Q> JOHNSON. (His anti|pathy to the Scotch beginning to ri&s;e,) <Q REND="inline">"I have not read Hume; but, doubt|le&s;s, Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;tory is better than the <HI>verbiage</HI> of Robert&s;on, or the foppery of Dalrymple."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Will you not admit the &s;uperiority of Robert&s;on,
<PB N="407" REF="438">
in who&s;e Hi&s;tory we find &s;uch penetration,&mdash;&s;uch painting?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you mu&s;t con&s;ider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not hi&s;tory, it is imagination. He who de&s;cribes what he never &s;aw, draws from fancy. Robert&s;on paints minds as Sir Jo&s;hua paints faces in a hi&s;tory-piece: he imagines an heroick countenance. You mu&s;t look upon Robert&s;on's work as romance, and try it by that &s;tandard. Hi&s;tory it is not. Be&s;ides, Sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Gold&s;mith has done this in his Hi&s;tory. Now Robert&s;on might have put twice as much into his book. Robert&s;on is like a man who has packed gold in wool: the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, Sir; I always thought Robert&s;on would be cru&s;hed by his own weight,&mdash;would be buried under his own ornaments. Gold&s;mith tells you &s;hortly all you want to know: Robert&s;on detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robert&s;on's cumbrous detail a &s;econd time; but Gold&s;mith's plain narrative will plea&s;e again and again. I would &s;ay to Robert&s;on what an old tutor of a College &s;aid to one of his pupils: 'Read over your compo|&s;itions, and wherever you meet with a pa&s;&s;age which you think is particularly fine, &s;trike it out.' Gold&s;mith's abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to &s;ay, that if you compare him with Vertot, in the &s;ame places of the Roman Hi&s;tory, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the art of compiling, and of &s;aying every thing he has to &s;ay in a plea&s;ing manner. He is now writing a Natural Hi&s;tory, and will make it as entertaining as a Per&s;ian Tale."</Q></P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the pre&s;ent topick without ob&s;erving, that it is probable that Dr. John&s;on, who owned that he often <Q REND="inline">"talked for victory,"</Q> rather urged plau&s;ible objections to Dr. Robert&s;on's excellent hi&s;torical works, in the ardour of conte&s;t, than expre&s;&s;ed his real and decided opinion; for it is not ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;hould &s;o widely differ from the re&s;t of the literary world.</P>
<P>JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I remember once being with Gold&s;mith in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. While we &s;urveyed the Poets' Corner, I &s;aid to him,

When we got to Temple-bar he &s;topped me, pointed to the heads upon it, and &s;lily whi&s;pered me,
<Q><L>'For&s;itan et no&s;trum nomen mi&s;cebitur <HI>ISTIS</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In allu&s;ion to Dr. John&s;on's &s;uppo&s;ed political principles, and perhaps his own.</NOTE>."</L></Q></Q></P>

 John&s;on prai&s;ed John Bunyan highly. <Q REND="inline">"His 'Pilgrim's Progre&s;s' has great merit, both for invention, imagination, and the conduct of the &s;tory; and it has had the be&s;t evidence of its merit, the general and continued appro|bation of mankind. Few books, I believe, have had a more exten&s;ive &s;ale. It is remarkable, that it begins very much like the poem of Dante; yet there was no tran&s;lation of Dante when Bunyan wrote. There is rea&s;on to think that he had read Spencer."</Q></P>
<P>A propo&s;ition which had been agitated, that monuments to eminent per&s;ons &s;hould, for the time to come, be erected in St. Paul's church as well as in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, was mentioned; and it was a&s;ked, who &s;hould be honoured by having his monument fir&s;t erected there. Somebody &s;ugge&s;ted Pope. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as Pope was a Roman Catholick, I would not have his to be fir&s;t. I think Milton's rather &s;hould have the precedence. I think more highly of him now than I did at twenty. There is more thinking in him and in Butler than in any of our poets."</Q></P>
<P>Some of the company expre&s;&s;ed a wonder why the authour of &s;o excellent a book as <Q REND="inline">"The whole Duty of Man"</Q> &s;hould conceal him&s;elf. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"There may be different rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this, any one of which would be very &s;ufficient. He may have been a clergyman, and may have thought that his religious coun&s;els would have le&s;s weight when known to come from a man who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was Theology. He may have been a man who&s;e practice was not &s;uitable to his principles; &s;o that his character might injure the effect of his book, which he had written in a &s;ea&s;on of penitence. Or he may have been a man of rigid &s;elf-denial, &s;o that he would have no reward for his pious labours while in this world, but refer it all to a future &s;tate."</Q></P>
<P>The gentlemen went away to their club, and I was left at Beauclerk's till the fate of my election &s;hould be announced to me. In a &s;hort time I received the agreeable intelligence that I was cho&s;en. I ha&s;tened to the place of meeting, and was introduced to &s;uch a &s;ociety as can &s;eldom be found. Mr. Edmund Burke, whom I then &s;aw for the fir&s;t time, and who&s;e &s;plendid talents had long made me ardently wi&s;h for his acquaintance; Dr. Nugent, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Mr. (now Sir William,) Jones, and the com|pany with whom I had dined. Upon my entrance, John&s;on placed him&s;elf behind a chair, on which he leaned as on a de&s;k or pulpit, and with humorous formality gave me a <HI>Charge,</HI> pointing out the conduct expected from me as a good member of this club.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith produced &s;ome very ab&s;urd ver&s;es which had been publickly recited to an audience for money. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I can match this non&s;en&s;e.

<P>Talking of puns, John&s;on, who had a great contempt for that &s;pecies of wit, deigned to allow that there was one good pun in <Q REND="inline">"Menagiana,"</Q> I think on the word <HI>corps.</HI></P>
<P>Much plea&s;ant conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, which John&s;on reli&s;hed with great good humour. But his conver&s;ation alone, or what led to it, or was interwoven with it, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of this work.</P>
<P>On Saturday, May 1, we dined by our&s;elves at our old rendezvous, the Mitre tavern. He was placid, but not much di&s;po&s;ed to talk. He ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"The Iri&s;h mix better with the Engli&s;h than the Scotch do; their lan|guage is nearer to Engli&s;h; as a proof of which, they &s;ucceed very well as players, which Scotchmen do not.

You are almo&s;t the only in&s;tance of a Scotchman that I have known, who did not at every other &s;entence bring in &s;ome other Scotchman."</Q></P>
<P>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I introduced a que&s;tion which has been much agitated in the Church of Scotland, whether the claim of lay-patrons to pre&s;ent mini&s;ters to pari&s;hes be well founded; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to be well founded, whether it ought to be exerci&s;ed without the concurrence of the people? That Church is compo&s;ed of a &s;eries of judicatures: a Pre&s;bytery,&mdash;a Synod,&mdash;and, finally, a General A&s;&s;embly; before all of which, this matter may be contended: and in &s;ome ca&s;es the Pre&s;bytery having refu&s;ed to induct or <HI>&s;ettle,</HI> as they call it, the per&s;on pre&s;ented by the patron, it has been found nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to the General A&s;&s;embly. He &s;aid, I might &s;ee the &s;ubject
<PB N="410" REF="441"> well treated in the <Q REND="inline">"Defence of Pluralities;"</Q> and although he thought that a patron &s;hould exerci&s;e his right with tenderne&s;s to the inclinations of the people of a pari&s;h, he was very clear as to his right. Then &s;uppo&s;ing the que&s;tion to be pleaded before the General A&s;&s;embly, he dictated to me what follows:</P>
<Q><P>AGAINST the right of patrons is commonly oppo&s;ed, by the inferiour judicatures, the plea of con&s;cience. Their con&s;cience tells them, that the people ought to choo&s;e their pa&s;tor; their con&s;cience tells them that they ought not to impo&s;e upon a congregation a mini&s;ter ungrateful and unaccept|able to his auditors. Con&s;cience is nothing more than a conviction felt by our|&s;elves of &s;omething to be done, or &s;omething to be avoided; and, in que&s;tions of &s;imple unperplexed morality, con&s;cience is very often a guide that may be tru&s;ted. But before con&s;cience can determine, the &s;tate of the que&s;tion is &s;uppo&s;ed to be completely known. In que&s;tions of law, or of fact, con|&s;cience is very often confounded with opinion. No man's con&s;cience can tell him the rights of another man: they mu&s;t be known by rational inve&s;tigation or hi&s;torical enquiry. Opinion, which he that holds it may call his con&s;cience, may teach &s;ome men that religion would be promoted, and quiet pre&s;erved, by granting to the people univer&s;ally the choice of their mini&s;ters. But it is a con&s;cience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the con|venience of another. Religion cannot be promoted by inju&s;tice: and it was never yet found that a popular election was very quietly tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>That ju&s;tice would be violated by transferring to the people the right of patronage, is apparent to all who know whence that right had its original. The right of patronage was not at fir&s;t a privilege torne by power from unre|&s;i&s;ting poverty. It is not an authority at fir&s;t u&s;urped in times of ignorance, and e&s;tabli&s;hed only by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and by precedents. It is not a grant capriciou&s;ly made from a higher tyrant to a lower. It is a right dearly purcha&s;ed by the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and ju&s;tly inherited by tho&s;e that &s;ucceeded them. When Chri&s;tianity was e&s;tabli&s;hed in this i&s;land, a regular mode of publick wor&s;hip was pre&s;cribed. Publick wor&s;hip requires a publick place; and the proprie|tors of lands, as they were converted, built churches for their families and their va&s;&s;als. For the maintenance of mini&s;ters, they &s;ettled a certain portion of their lands; and a di&s;trict, through which each mini&s;ter was required to extend his care, was, by that circum&s;cription, con&s;tituted a pari&s;h. This is a po&s;ition &s;o generally received in England, that the extent of a manor and of a pari&s;h are regularly received for each other. The churches which the proprietors of lands had thus built and thus endowed, they ju&s;tly thought them&s;elves entitled to provide with mini&s;ters; and where the epi&s;copal govern|ment
<PB N="411" REF="442">
prevails, the Bi&s;hop has no power to reject a man nominated by the patron, but for &s;ome crime that might exclude him from the prie&s;thood. For the endowment of the church being the gift of the landlord, he was con|&s;equently at liberty to give it according to his choice, to any man capable of performing the holy offices. The people did not choo&s;e him, becau&s;e the people did not pay him.</P>
<P>We hear it &s;ometimes urged, that this original right is pa&s;&s;ed out of memory, and is obliterated and ob&s;cured by many tran&s;lations of property and changes of government; that &s;carce any church is now in the hands of the heirs of the builders; and that the pre&s;ent per&s;ons have entered &s;ub&s;equently upon the pretended rights by a thou&s;and accidental and unknown cau&s;es. Much of this, perhaps, is true. But how is the right of patronage extingui&s;hed? If the right followed the lands, it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame equity by which the lands are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is, in effect, part of the manor, and protected by the &s;ame laws with every other privilege. Let us &s;uppo&s;e an e&s;tate forfeited by trea&s;on, and granted by the Crown to a new family. With the lands were forfeited all the rights appendant to tho&s;e lands; by the &s;ame power that grants the lands, the rights al&s;o are granted. The right lo&s;t to the patron falls not to the people, but is either retained by the Crown, or, what to the people is the &s;ame thing, is by the Crown given away. Let it change hands ever &s;o often, it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him that receives it with the &s;ame right as it was con|veyed. It may, indeed, like all our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, be forcibly &s;eized or fraudu|lently obtained. But no injury is &s;till done to the people; for what they never had, they have never lo&s;t. Caius may u&s;urp the right of Titius; but neither Caius nor Titius injure the people: and no man's con&s;cience, however tender or however active, can prompt him to re&s;tore what may be proved to have been never taken away. Suppo&s;ing, what I think cannot be proved, that a popular election of mini&s;ters were to be de&s;ired, our de&s;ires are not the mea&s;ure of equity. It were to be de&s;ired that power &s;hould be only in the hands of the merciful, and riches in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the generous; but the law mu&s;t leave both riches and power where it finds them; and mu&s;t often leave riches with the covetous, and power with the cruel. Convenience may be a rule in little things, where no other rule has been e&s;tabli&s;hed. But as the great end of government is to give every man his own, no inconvenience is greater than that of making right uncertain. Nor is any man more an enemy to publick peace, than he who fills weak heads with imaginary claims, and breaks the &s;eries of civil &s;ubordination, by inciting the lower cla&s;&s;es of mankind to encroach upon the higher.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="443">
Having thus &s;hewn that the right of patronage, being originally purcha&s;ed, may be legally transferred, and that it is now in the hands of lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, at lea&s;t as certainly as any other right, we have left to the advocates of the people no other plea than that of convenience. Let us, therefore, now con|&s;ider what the people would really gain by a general abolition of the right of patronage. What is mo&s;t to be de&s;ired by &s;uch a change is, that the country &s;hould be &s;upplied with better mini&s;ters. But why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e that the pari&s;h will make a wi&s;er choice than the patron? If we &s;uppo&s;e mankind actuated by intere&s;t, the patron is more likely to choo&s;e with caution, becau&s;e he will &s;uffer more by choo&s;ing wrong. By the deficiencies of his mini&s;ter, or by his vices, he is equally offended with the re&s;t of the congregation; but he will have this rea&s;on more to lament them, that they will be imputed to his ab&s;urdity or corruption. The qualifications of a mini&s;ter are well known to be learning and piety. Of his learning the patron is probably the only judge in the pari&s;h; and of his piety not le&s;s a judge than others; and is more likely to inquire minutely and diligently before he gives a pre&s;entation, than one of the parochial rabble, who can give nothing but a vote. It may be urged, that though the pari&s;h might not choo&s;e better mini&s;ters, they would at lea&s;t choo&s;e mini&s;ters whom they like better, and who would therefore officiate with greater efficacy. That ignorance and perver&s;ene&s;s &s;hould always obtain what they like, was never con&s;idered as the end of government; of which it is the great and &s;tanding benefit, that the wi&s;e &s;ee for the &s;imple, and the regular act for the capricious. But that this argument &s;uppo&s;es the people capable of judging, and re&s;olute to act according to their be&s;t judgements, though this be &s;uf|ficiently ab&s;urd, is not all its ab&s;urdity. It &s;uppo&s;es not only wi&s;dom, but unanimity in tho&s;e, who upon no other occa&s;ions are unanimous or wi&s;e. If by &s;ome &s;trange concurrence all the voices of a pari&s;h &s;hould unite in the choice of any &s;ingle man, though I could not charge the patron with inju&s;tice for pre&s;enting a mini&s;ter, I &s;hould cen&s;ure him as unkind and injudicious. But, it is evident, that as in all other popular elections there will be contra|riety of judgement and acrimony of pa&s;&s;ion, a pari&s;h upon every vacancy would break into factions, and the conte&s;t for the choice of a mini&s;ter would &s;et neighbours at variance and bring di&s;cord into families. The mini&s;ter would be taught all the arts of a candidate, would flatter &s;ome and bribe others; and the electors, as in all other ca&s;es, would call for holidays and ale, and break the heads of each other during the jollity of the canvas. The time mu&s;t, however, come at la&s;t, when one of the factions mu&s;t prevail, and one of the mini&s;ters get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church. On what terms does he enter
<PB N="413" REF="444" MS="y">
upon his mini&s;try but tho&s;e of enmity with half his pari&s;h? By what prudence or what diligence can he hope to conciliate the affections of that party by who&s;e defeat he has obtained his living? Every man who voted again&s;t him will enter the church with hanging head and downca&s;t eyes, afraid to encounter that neighbour by who&s;e vote and influence he has been overpowered. He will hate his neighbour for oppo&s;ing him, and his mini&s;ter for having pro&s;pered by the oppo&s;ition; and, as he will never &s;ee him but with pain, he will never &s;ee him but with hatred. Of a mini&s;ter pre&s;ented by the patron, the pari&s;h has &s;eldom any thing wor&s;e to &s;ay than that they do not know him. Of a mini&s;ter cho&s;en by a popular conte&s;t, all tho&s;e who do not favour him have nur&s;ed up in their bo&s;oms principles of hatred and rea&s;ons of rejection. Anger is excited principally by pride. The pride of a common man is very little exa&s;perated by the &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;urpation of an acknowledged &s;uperiour. He bears only his little &s;hare of a general evil, and &s;uffers in common with the whole pari&s;h: but when the conte&s;t is between equals, the defeat has many aggravations; and he that is defeated by his next neighbour is &s;eldom &s;atisfied without &s;ome revenge: and it is hard to &s;ay what bitterne&s;s of malignity would prevail in a pari&s;h where the&s;e elections &s;hould happen to be frequent, and the enmity of oppo&s;ition &s;hould be re-kindled before it had cooled.</P></Q>
<P>Though I pre&s;ent to my readers Dr. John&s;on's ma&s;terly thoughts on this &s;ubject, I think it proper to declare, that notwith&s;tanding I am my&s;elf a lay|patron, I do not entirely &s;ub&s;cribe to his opinion.</P>
<P>On Friday, May 7, I breakfa&s;ted with him at Mr. Thrale's in the Boro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gh. While we were alone, I endeavoured as well as I could to apologi&s;e for a lady who had been divorced from her hu&s;band by act of parliament. I &s;aid, that he had u&s;ed her very ill, had behaved brutally to her, and that &s;he could not continue to live with him without having her delicacy contaminated; that all affection for him was thus de&s;troyed; that the e&s;&s;ence of conjugal union being gone, there remained only a cold form, a mere civil obligation; that &s;he was in the prime of life, with qualities to produce happine&s;s; that the&s;e ought not to be lo&s;t; and, that the gentleman on who&s;e account &s;he was divorced had gained her heart while thus unhappily &s;ituated. Seduced, perhaps, by the charms of the lady in que&s;tion, I thus attempted to palliate what I was &s;en|&s;ible could not be ju&s;tified; for, when I had fini&s;hed my harangue, my vene|rable friend gave me a proper check: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, never accu&s;tom your mind to mingle virtue and vice. The woman's a whore, and there's an end on't."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="445">
 He de&s;cribed the father of one of his friends thus: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he was &s;o exuberant a talker at publick meetings, that the gentlemen of his county were afraid of him. No bu&s;ine&s;s could be done for his declamation."</Q></P>
<P>He did not give me full credit when I mentioned that I had carried on a &s;hort conver&s;ation by &s;igns with &s;ome E&s;quimaux, who were then in London, particularly with one of them who was a prie&s;t. He thought I could not make them under&s;tand me. No man was more incredulous as to particular facts, which were at all extraordinary; and therefore no man was more &s;crupulou&s;ly inqui&s;itive, in order to di&s;cover the truth.</P>
<P>I dined with him this day at the hou&s;e of my friends, Me&s;&s;ieurs Edward and Charles Dilly, book&s;ellers in the Poultry: there were pre&s;ent, their elder brother Mr. Dilly of Bedford&s;hire, Dr. Gold&s;mith, Mr. Langton, Mr. Claxton, Reverend Dr. Mayo a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, the Reverend Mr. Toplady, and my friend the Reverend Mr. Temple.</P>
<P>Hawke&s;worth's compilation of the voyages to the South Sea being men|tioned;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you talk of it as a &s;ubject of commerce, it will be gainful; if as a book that is to increa&s;e human knowledge, I believe there will not be much of that. Hawke&s;worth can tell only what the voyagers have told him, and they have found very little, only one new animal, I think."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But many in&s;ects, Sir."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, as to in&s;ects, Ray reckons of Briti&s;h in&s;ects twenty thou&s;and &s;pecies. They might have have &s;taid at home and di&s;covered enough in that way."</Q></P>
<P>Talking of birds, I mentioned Mr. Daines Barrington's ingenious E&s;&s;ay again&s;t the received notion of their migration. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I think we have as good evidence for the migration of woodcocks as can be de&s;ired. We find they di&s;appear at a certain time of the year, and appear again at a certain time of the year; and &s;ome of them, when weary in their flight, have been known to alight on the rigging of &s;hips far out at &s;ea."</Q> One of the company ob&s;erved, that there had been in&s;tances of &s;ome of them found in &s;ummer in E&s;&s;ex. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that &s;trengthens our argument. <HI>Exceptio probat regulam.</HI> Some being found &s;hews, that, if all remained, many would be found.

<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I am well a&s;&s;ured that the people of Otaheite who have the bread-tree, the fruit of which &s;erves them for bread, laughed heartily when they were informed of the tedious proce&s;s nece&s;&s;ary with us to have bread;&mdash;plowing, &s;owing, harrowing, reaping, thre&s;hing, grinding, baking."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, all ignorant &s;avages will laugh when they are told of

the advantages of civilized life. Were you to tell men who live without hou&s;es, how we pile brick upon brick and rafter upon rafter, and that after a hou&s;e is rai&s;ed to a certain height, a man tumbles off a &s;caffold and breaks his neck, he would laugh heartily at our folly in building; but it does not follow that men are better without hou&s;es. No, Sir, (holding up a &s;lice of a good loaf,) this is better than the bread-tree."</Q></P>
<P>He repeated an argument, which is to be found in his <Q REND="inline">"Rambler,"</Q> again&s;t the notion that the brute creation is endowed with the faculty of rea&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"birds build by in&s;tinct; they never improve: they build their fir&s;t ne&s;t as well as any one that they ever build."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"Yet we &s;ee if you take away a bird's ne&s;t with the eggs in it, &s;he will make a &s;lighter ne&s;t and lay again."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, that is becau&s;e at fir&s;t &s;he has full time, and makes her ne&s;t deliberately.

<P>I introduced the &s;ubject of toleration. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Every &s;ociety has a right to pre&s;erve publick peace and order, and therefore has a good right to prohibit the propagation of opinions which have a dangerous tendency. To &s;ay the <HI>magi&s;trate</HI> has this right, is u&s;ing an inadequate word: it is the <HI>&s;ociety</HI> for which the magi&s;trate is agent. He may be morally or theologically wrong in re&s;training the propagation of opinions which he thinks dangerous, but he is politically right."</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"I am of opinion, Sir, that every man is entitled to liberty of con&s;cience in religion; and that the magi&s;trate cannot re&s;train that right."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I agree with you. Every man has a right to liberty of con&s;cience, and with that the magi&s;trate cannot interfere. People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking; nay, with liberty of preach|ing. Every man has a phy&s;ical right to think as he plea&s;es; for it cannot be di&s;covered how he thinks. He has not a moral right; for he ought to inform him&s;elf and think ju&s;tly. But, Sir, no member of a &s;ociety has a right to <HI>teach</HI> any doctrine contrary to what that &s;ociety holds to be true. The magi&s;trate, I &s;ay, may be wrong in what he thinks; but, while he thinks him&s;elf right, he may, and ought to enforce what he thinks."</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, we are to remain always in errour, and truth never can prevail; and the magi&s;trate was right in per&s;ecuting the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the only method by which religious truth can be e&s;tabli&s;hed is by martyrdom. The magi&s;trate has a right to enforce what he thinks; and he who is con&s;cious of the truth has a right to &s;uffer. I am afraid there is no other way of a&s;certaining the
<PB N="416" REF="447"> truth, but by per&s;ecution on the one hand and enduring it on the other."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"But how is a man to act, Sir? Though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrine, may he not think it wrong to expo&s;e him&s;elf to per&s;ecution? Has he a right to do &s;o? Is it not, as it were, committing voluntary &s;uicide?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, as to voluntary &s;uicide, as you call it, there are twenty thou&s;and men in an army who will go without &s;cruple to be &s;hot at, and mount a breach for five-pence a day."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"But have they a moral right to do this?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, if you will not take the univer&s;al opinion of mankind, I have nothing to &s;ay. If mankind cannot defend their own way of thinking, I cannot defend it. Sir, if a man is in doubt whether it would be better for him to expo&s;e him&s;elf to martyrdom or not, he &s;hould not do it. He mu&s;t be convinced that he has a delegation from heaven."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"I would con&s;ider whether there is the greater chance of good or evil upon the whole. If I &s;ee a man who has fallen into a well, I would wi&s;h to help him out; but if there is a greater probability that he &s;hall pull me in, than that I &s;hall pull him out, I would not attempt it. So were I to go to Turkey, I might wi&s;h to convert the Grand Signor to the Chri&s;tian faith; but when I con&s;idered that I &s;hould probably be put to death without effectuating my purpo&s;e in any degree, I &s;hould keep my&s;elf quiet."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you mu&s;t con&s;ider that we have perfect and imperfect obli|gations. Perfect obligations, which are generally not to do &s;omething, are clear and po&s;itive; as, 'thou &s;halt not kill.' But charity, for in&s;tance, is not definable by limits. It is a duty to give to the poor; but no man can &s;ay how much another &s;hould give to the poor, or when a man has given too little to &s;ave his &s;oul. In the &s;ame manner, it is a duty to in&s;truct the igno|rant, and of con&s;equence to convert infidels to Chri&s;tianity; but no man in the common cour&s;e of things is obliged to carry this to &s;uch a degree as to incur the danger of martyrdom, as no man is obliged to &s;trip him&s;elf to the &s;hirt in order to give charity. I have &s;aid, that a man mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that he has a particular delegation from heaven."</Q> GOLDSMITH. <Q REND="inline">"How is this to be known? Our fir&s;t reformers, who were burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST."</Q>&mdash;JOHNSON. (interrupting him,) <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST, but for in&s;ulting tho&s;e who did believe it. And, Sir, when the fir&s;t reformers began, they did not intend to be martyred: as many of them ran away as could."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, there was your countryman, Elwal, who you told me challenged King George with his black-guards and his red-guards."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"My countryman, Elwal, Sir, &s;hould have been put in the &s;tocks; a proper pulpit
<PB N="417" REF="448">
for him, and he'd have had a numerous audience. A man who preaches in the &s;tocks will always have hearers enough."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"But Elwal thought him&s;elf in the right."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We are not providing for mad people; there are places for them in the neighbourhood,"</Q> (meaning Moorfields.) MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, is it not very hard that I &s;hould not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the truth?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you might contrive to teach your children <HI>extr&agrave; &s;candalum;</HI> but, Sir, the magi&s;trate, if he knows it, has a right to re&s;train you. Suppo&s;e you teach your children to be thieves?"</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"This is making a joke of the &s;ubject."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, take it thus:&mdash;that you teach them the community of goods, for which there are as many plau&s;ible arguments as for mo&s;t erroneous doctrines. You teach them that all things at fir&s;t were in common, and that no man had a right to any thing but as he laid his hands upon it; and that this &s;till is, or ought to be, the rule among&s;t mankind. Here, Sir, you &s;ap a great principle in &s;ociety,&mdash;property. And don't you think the magi&s;trate would have a right to prevent you? Or, &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould teach your children the notions of the Adamites, and they &s;hould run naked into the &s;treets, would not the magi&s;trate have a right to flog 'em into their doublets?"</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"I think the magi&s;trate has no right to interfere till there is &s;ome overt act."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"So, Sir, though he &s;ees an enemy to the &s;tate charging a blunderbu&s;s, he is not to interfere till it is fired off."</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t be &s;ure of its direction again&s;t the &s;tate."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The magi&s;trate is to judge of that.&mdash;He has no right to re&s;train your thinking, becau&s;e the evil centers in your&s;elf. If a man were &s;itting at this table, and chopping off his fingers, the magi&s;trate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to re&s;train him, however he might do it from kindne&s;s as a parent.&mdash;Though, indeed, upon more con|&s;ideration, I think he may; as it is probable that he who is chopping off his own fingers, may &s;oon proceed to chop off tho&s;e of other people. If I think it right to &s;teal Mr. Dilly's plate, I am a bad man; but he can &s;ay nothing to me. If I make an open declaration that I think &s;o, he will keep me out of his hou&s;e. If I put forth my hand, I &s;hall be &s;ent to Newgate. This is the gradation of thinking, preaching, and acting: if a man thinks erroneou&s;ly, he may keep his thoughts to him&s;elf, and nobody will trouble him; if he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eaches erroneous doctrine, &s;ociety may expel him; if he acts in con&s;equence of it, the law takes place, and he is hanged."</Q> MAYO. <Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, ought not Chri&s;tians to have liberty of con&s;cience?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I have already told you &s;o, Sir. You are coming back to where you were."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Mayo is always taking a return po&s;t-chai&s;e, and going the &s;tage over again.

The &s;cintillations of John&s;on's genius fla&s;hed every time he was &s;truck, without his receiving any injury. Hence he obtained the epithet of THE LITERARY ANVIL.</NOTE>. Sir, it is no matter, politically, whether the magi&s;trate be right or wrong. Suppo&s;e a club were to be formed to drink confu&s;ion to King George the Third, and a happy re&s;toration to Charles the Third; this would be very bad with re&s;pect to the &s;tate; but every member of that club mu&s;t either conform to its rules, or be turned out of it. Old Baxter, I remember, maintains, that the magi&s;trate &s;hould 'tolerate all things that are tolerable.' This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle; but it &s;hews that he thought &s;ome things were not tolerable."</Q> TOPLADY. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have untwi&s;ted this difficult &s;ubject with great dexterity."</Q></P>
<P>During this argument, Gold&s;mith &s;at in re&s;tle&s;s agitation, from a wi&s;h to get in, and &s;hine. Finding him&s;elf excluded, he had taken his hat to go away, but remained for &s;ome time with it in his hand, like a game&s;ter, who at the clo&s;e of a long night, lingers for a little while, to &s;ee if he can have a favour|able opening to fini&s;h with &s;ucce&s;s. Once when he was beginning to &s;peak, he found him&s;elf overpowered by the loud voice of John&s;on, who was at the oppo&s;ite end of the table, and did not perceive Gold&s;mith's attempt. Thus di&s;appointed of his wi&s;h to obtain the attention of the company, Gold&s;mith in a pa&s;&s;ion threw down his hat, looking angrily at John&s;on, and exclaiming in a bitter tone, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Take it."</HI></Q> When Toplady was going to &s;peak, John&s;on uttered &s;ome &s;ound, which led Gold&s;mith to think that he was beginning again, and taking the words from Toplady. Upon which, he &s;eized this opportunity of venting his own envy and &s;pleen, under the pretext of &s;upporting another per&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he to John&s;on,) the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray allow us now to hear him."</Q> JOHNSON.

<P>A gentleman pre&s;ent ventured to a&s;k Dr. John&s;on if there was not a mate|rial difference as to toleration of opinions which lead to action, and opinions merely &s;peculative; for in&s;tance, would it be wrong in the magi&s;trate to tolerate
<PB N="419" REF="450">
tho&s;e who preach again&s;t the doctrine of the TRINITY. John&s;on was highly offended, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder, Sir, how a gentleman of your piety can introduce this &s;ubject in a mixed company."</Q> He told me afterwards, that the impropriety was, that perhaps &s;ome of the company might have talked on the &s;ubject in &s;uch terms as would have &s;hocked him; or he might have been forced to appear in their eyes a narrow-minded man. The gentleman, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference, &s;aid, he had only hinted at the que&s;tion from a de&s;ire to hear Dr. John&s;on's opinion upon it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, I think that permitting men to preach any opinion contrary to the doctrine of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, tends, in a certain degree, to le&s;&s;en the authority of the church, and, con&s;equently, to le&s;&s;en the influence of religion."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It may be con&s;idered, (&s;aid the gentleman,) whether it would not be politick to tolerate in &s;uch a ca&s;e."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, we have been talking of <HI>right:</HI> this is another que&s;tion. <HI>I</HI> think it is <HI>not</HI> politick to tolerate in &s;uch a ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Though he did not think it fit that &s;o aweful a &s;ubject &s;hould be introduced in a mixed company, and therefore at this time waved the theological que&s;|tion; yet his own orthodox belief in the &s;acred my&s;tery of the TRINITY is evinced beyond doubt, by the following pa&s;&s;age in his private devotions: <Q REND="inline">"O LORD, hear my prayers, for JESUS CHRIST'S &s;ake; to whom with thee and the HOLY GHOST, <HI>three per&s;ons and one</HI> GOD, be all honour and glory, world without end.

<P>BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Mr. Dilly, how does Dr. Leland's 'Hi&s;tory of Ireland' &s;ell?"</Q> JOHNSON. (Bur&s;ting forth with a generous indignation,) <Q REND="inline">"The Iri&s;h are in a mo&s;t unnatural &s;tate; for we &s;ee there the minority prevailing over the majority. There is no in&s;tance, even in the ten per&s;ecutions, of &s;uch &s;everity as that which the Prote&s;tants of Ireland have exerci&s;ed again&s;t the Catho|licks. Did we tell them we have conquered them, it would be above board: to puni&s;h them by confi&s;cation and other penalties, as rebels, was mon|&s;trous inju&s;tice.

<P>He and Mr. Langton and I went together to the Club, where we found Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, and &s;ome other members, and among&s;t them our friend Gold&s;mith, who &s;at &s;ilently brooding over John&s;on's reprimand to him after dinner. John&s;on perceived this, and &s;aid a&s;ide to &s;ome of us, <Q REND="inline">"I'll make Gold&s;mith forgive me;"</Q> and then called to him in a loud voice, <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Gold&s;mith,&mdash;&s;omething pa&s;&s;ed to-day where you and I dined; I a&s;k your par|don."</Q> Gold&s;mith an&s;wered placidly, <Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t be much from you, Sir, that I take ill."</Q> And &s;o at once the difference was over, and they were on as ea&s;y terms as ever, and Gold&s;mith rattled away as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>In our way to the club to-night, when I regretted that Gold&s;mith would, upon every occa&s;ion, endeavour to &s;hine, by which he often expo&s;ed him&s;elf, Mr. Langton ob&s;erved, that he was not like Addi&s;on, who was content with the fame of his writings, and did not aim al&s;o at excellency in conver&s;ation, for which he found him&s;elf unfit; and that he &s;aid to a lady, who complained of his having talked little in company, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I have but nine-pence in ready money, but I can draw for a thou&s;and pounds."</Q> I ob&s;erved, that Gold&s;mith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet, but, not content with that, was always taking out his pur&s;e. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, and that &s;o often an empty pur&s;e!"</Q></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith's ince&s;&s;ant de&s;ire of being con&s;picuous in company, was the occa&s;ion of his &s;ometimes appearing to &s;uch di&s;advantage as one &s;hould hardly have &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible in a man of his genius. When his literary reputation had ri&s;en de&s;ervedly high, and his &s;ociety was much courted, he became very jealous of the extraordinary attention which was every where paid to John&s;on. One evening, in a circle of wits, he found fault with me for talking of John&s;on as entitled to the honour of unque&s;tionable &s;uperiority. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;aid he,) you are for making a monarchy of what &s;hould be a republick."</Q></P>
<P>He was &s;till more mortified, when talking in a company with fluent vivacity, and, as he flattered him&s;elf, to the admiration of all who were pre&s;ent; a German who &s;at next him, and perceived John&s;on rolling him&s;elf, as if about to &s;peak, &s;uddenly &s;topped him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Stay, &s;tay,&mdash;Toctor Shon&s;on is going to &s;ay &s;omething."</Q> This was, no doubt, very provoking, e&s;pecially to one &s;o irritable as Gold&s;mith, who frequently mentioned it with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="452">
It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that Gold&s;mith was &s;ometimes content to be treated with an ea&s;y familiarity, but, upon occa&s;ions, would be con&s;equential and important. An in&s;tance of this occurred in a &s;mall particular. John&s;on had a way of contracting the names of his friends; as, Beauclerk, Beau; Bo&s;well, Bozzy; Langton, Lanky; Murphy, Mur; Sheridan, Sherry. I remember one day, when Tom Davies was telling that Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"We are all in labour for a name to <HI>Goldy</HI>'s play,"</Q> Gold&s;mith &s;eemed di&s;|plea&s;ed that &s;uch a liberty &s;hould be taken with his name, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have often de&s;ired him not to call me <HI>Goldy."</HI></Q> Tom was remarkably attentive to the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance about John&s;on. I recollect his telling me once, on my arrival in London, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, our great friend has made an im|provement on his appellation of old Mr. Sheridan.

<P>On Sunday, May 8, I dined with John&s;on at Mr. Langton's, with Dr. Beattie and &s;ome other company. He de&s;canted on the &s;ubject of Literary Property. <Q REND="inline">"There &s;eems, (&s;aid he,) to be in authours a &s;tronger right of property than that by occupancy; a metaphy&s;ical right, a right, as it were, of creation,
<PB N="422" REF="453" MS="y">
 which &s;hould from its nature be perpetual; but the con&s;ent of nations is again&s;t it, and indeed rea&s;on and the intere&s;ts of learning are again&s;t it; for were it to be perpetual, no book, however u&s;eful, could be univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed among&s;t mankind, &s;hould the proprietor take it into his head to re&s;train its circulation. No book could have the advantage of being edited with notes, however nece&s;&s;ary to its elucidation, &s;hould the proprietor perver&s;ely oppo&s;e it. For the general good of the world, therefore, whatever valuable work has once been created by an authour, and i&s;&s;ued out by him, &s;hould be under&s;tood as no longer in his power, but as belonging to the publick; at the &s;ame time the authour is entitled to an adequate reward. This he &s;hould have by an exclu&s;ive right to his work for a con&s;iderable number of years."</Q></P>
<P>He attacked Lord Monboddo's &s;trange &s;peculation on the primitive &s;tate of human nature; ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it is all conjecture about a thing u&s;ele&s;s, even were it known to be true. Knowledge of all kinds is good. Conjecture, as to things u&s;eful, is good; but conjecture as to what it would be u&s;ele&s;s to know, &s;uch as whether men ever went upon all four, is very idle."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, May 9, as I was to &s;et out on my return to Scotland next morning, I was de&s;irous to &s;ee as much of Dr. John&s;on as I could. But I fir&s;t called on Gold&s;mith to take leave of him. The jealou&s;y and envy which, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many mo&s;t amiable qualities, he frankly avowed, broke out violently at this interview. Upon another occa&s;ion, when Gold&s;mith confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be of an envious di&s;po&s;ition, I contended with John&s;on that we ought not to be angry with him, he was &s;o candid in owning it. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, (&s;aid John&s;on,) we mu&s;t be angry that a man has &s;uch a &s;uper|abundance of an odious quality that he cannot keep it within his own brea&s;t, but it boils over."</Q> In my opinion, however, Gold&s;mith had not more of it than other people have, but only talked of it freely.</P>
<P>He now &s;eemed very angry that John&s;on was going to be a traveller; &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he would be a dead weight for me to carry, and that I &s;hould never be able to lug him along through the Highlands and Hebrides."</Q> Nor would he patiently allow me to enlarge upon John&s;on's wonderful abilities; but exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Is he like Burke, who winds into a &s;ubject like a &s;erpent?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But, (&s;aid I,) John&s;on is the Hercules who &s;trangled &s;erpents in his cradle."</Q></P>
<P>I dined with Dr. John&s;on at General Paoli's. He was obliged, by incifpo|&s;ition, to leave the company early; he appointed me, however, to meet him in the evening at Mr. (now Sir Robert,) Chambers's in the Temple, where he accordingly came, though he continued to be very ill. Chambers, as is common on &s;uch occa&s;ions, pre&s;cribed various remedies to him. JOHNSON.
<PB N="423" REF="454" MS="y">
(fretted by pain,) <Q REND="inline">"Pr'ythee don't teaze me. Stay till I am well, and then you &s;hall tell me how to cure my&s;elf."</Q> He grew better, and talked with a noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of keeping up the repre&s;entation of re&s;pectable families. His zeal on this &s;ubject was a circum&s;tance in his character exceedingly remark|able, when it is con&s;idered that he him&s;elf had no preten&s;ions to blood. I heard him once &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I have great merit in being zealous for &s;ubordination and the honours of birth; for I can hardly tell who was my grandfather."</Q> He maintained the dignity and propriety of male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in oppo&s;ition to the opinion of one of our friends, who had that day employed Mr. Chambers to draw his will, devi&s;ing his e&s;tate to his three &s;i&s;ters, in preference to a remote heir male. John&s;on called them three <HI>dowdies,</HI> and &s;aid, with as high a &s;pirit as the bolde&s;t Baron in the mo&s;t perfect days of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, <Q REND="inline">"An ancient e&s;tate &s;hould always go to males. It is mighty fooli&s;h to let a &s;tranger have it, becau&s;e he marries your daughter, and takes your name. As for an e&s;tate newly acquired by trade, you may give it, if you will, to the dog <HI>Towzer,</HI> and let him keep his <HI>own</HI> name."</Q></P>
<P>I have known him at times exceedingly diverted at what &s;eemed to others a very &s;mall &s;port. He now laughed immoderately, without any rea&s;on that we could perceive, at our friend's making his will; called him the <HI>te&s;tator,</HI> and added, <Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay, he thinks he has done a mighty thing. He won't &s;tay till he gets home to his &s;eat in the country, to produce this wonderful deed: he'll call up the landlord of the fir&s;t inn on the road; and, after a &s;uitable preface upon mortality and the uncertainty of life, will tell him that he &s;hould not delay making his will; and here, Sir, will he &s;ay, is my will, which I have ju&s;t made, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of the able&s;t lawyers in the kingdom; and he will read it to him (laughing all the time). He believes he has made this will; but he did not make it: you, Chambers, made it for him. I tru&s;t you have had more con&s;cience than to make him &s;ay, 'being of &s;ound under&s;tanding;' ha, ha, ha! I hope he has left me a legacy. I'd have his will turned into ver&s;e, like a ballad."</Q></P>
<P>In this playful manner did he run on, exulting in his own plea&s;antry, which certainly was not &s;uch as might be expected from the authour of <Q REND="inline">"The Rambler,"</Q> but which is here pre&s;erved, that my readers may be acquainted even with the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ional characteri&s;ticks of &s;o eminent a man.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers did not by any means reli&s;h this jocularity upon a matter of which <HI>pars magna fuit,</HI> and &s;eemed impatient till he got rid of us. John&s;on could not &s;top his merriment, but continued it all the way till we got without the Temple-gate. He then bur&s;t into &s;uch a fit of laughter, that
<PB N="424" REF="455" MS="y">
 he appeared to be almo&s;t in a convul&s;ion; and, in order to &s;upport him&s;elf, laid hold of one of the po&s;ts at the &s;ide of the foot-pavement, and &s;ent forth peals &s;o loud, that in the &s;ilence of the night his voice &s;eemed to re&s;ound from Temple-bar to Fleet-ditch.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t ludicrous exhibition of the aweful, melancholy, and venerable John&s;on, happened well to counteract the feelings of &s;adne&s;s which I u&s;ed to experience when parting with him for a con&s;iderable time. I accompanied him to his door, where he gave me his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>He records of him&s;elf this year, <Q REND="inline">"Between Ea&s;ter and Whit&s;untide, having always con&s;idered that time as propitious to &s;tudy, I attempted to learn the Low Dutch language <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Prayers and Meditations, p. 129.</NOTE>."</Q> It is to be ob&s;erved, that he here admits an opinion of the human mind being influenced by &s;ea&s;ons, which he ridicules in his writings. His progre&s;s, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"was interrupted by a fever, which, by the imprudent u&s;e of a &s;mall print, left an inflammation in his u&s;eful eye."</Q> We cannot but admire his &s;pirit when we know, that amid&s;t a complication of bodily and mental di&s;tre&s;s, he was &s;till animated with the de&s;ire of intellectual improvement. Various notes of his &s;tudies appear on different days, in his manu&s;cript diary of this year; &s;uch as, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Inchoavi lectionem Pentateuchi&mdash;Finivi lectionem Conf. Fab. Burdonum.&mdash;Legi primum actum Troadum.&mdash;Legi Di&s;&s;erta|tionem Clerici po&s;tremam de Pent.</HI>&mdash;2 <HI>of Clark's Sermons.&mdash;L. Appolonii pugnam Betriciam.&mdash;L. centum ver&s;us Homeri."</HI></Q> Let this &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of what acce&s;&s;ions of literature he was perpetually infu&s;ing into his mind, while he charged him&s;elf with idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>This year died Mrs. Salu&s;bury, (mother of Mrs. Thrale,) a lady whom he appears to have e&s;teemed much, and who&s;e memory he honoured with an Epitaph <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Piozzi's Anecdotes of John&s;on, p. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a letter from Edinburgh, dated the 29th of May, I pre&s;&s;ed him to per&s;e|vere in his re&s;olution to make this year the projected vi&s;it to the Hebrides, of which he and I had talked for many years, and which I was confident would afford us much entertainment.</P>

<P>His &s;tay in Scotland was from the 18th of Augu&s;t, on which day he arrived, till the 22d of November, when he &s;et out on his return to London; and I believe ninety-four days were never pa&s;&s;ed by any man in a more vigorous exertion.</P>
<P>He came by the way of Berwick upon Tweed to Edinburgh, where he re|mained a few days, and then went by St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, Inverne&s;s, and Fort Augu&s;tus, to the Hebrides, to vi&s;it which was the principal object he had
<PB N="427" REF="458">
in view. He vi&s;ited the i&s;les of Sky, Ra&s;ay, Col, Mull, Inchkenneth, and Icolmkill. He travelled through Argyle&s;hire by Inveraray, and from thence by Lochlomond and Dunbarton to Gla&s;gow, then by Loudon to Auchinleck in Ayr&s;hire, the &s;eat of my family, and then by Hamilton, back to Edinburgh, where he again &s;pent &s;ome time. He thus &s;aw the four Univer&s;ities of Scot|land, its three principal cities, and as much of the Highland and in&s;ular life as was &s;ufficient for his philo&s;ophical contemplation. I had the plea&s;ure of accompanying him during the whole of this journey. He was re&s;pectfully entertained by the great, the learned, and the elegant, wherever he went; nor was he le&s;s delighted with the ho&s;pitality which he experienced in hum|bler life.</P>
<P>His various adventures, and the force and vivacity of his mind, as exer|ci&s;ed during this peregrination, upon innumerable topicks, have been faithfully and to the be&s;t of my abilities di&s;played in my <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> to which, as the publick has been plea&s;ed to honour it by a very exten&s;ive circulation, I beg to refer, as to a &s;eparate and remarkable portion of his life, which may be there &s;een in detail&punc; and which exhibits as &s;triking a view of his powers in conver&s;ation, as his works do of his excellence in writing.

<P>His humane forgiving di&s;po&s;ition was put to a pretty &s;trong te&s;t on his return to London, by a liberty which Mr. Thomas Davies had taken with him in his ab&s;ence, which was, to publi&s;h two volumes, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;cel|laneous and fugitive Pieces,"</Q> which he adverti&s;ed in the new&s;papers, <Q REND="inline">"By the Authour of the Rambler."</Q> In this collection, &s;everal of Dr. John&s;on's acknowledged writings, and &s;everal of his anonymous performances, and &s;ome which he had written for others, were in&s;erted; but there were al&s;o &s;ome in which he had no concern whatever.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>[Not dated, but written about <DATE>the 15th of March.]</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a&s;hamed to think that &s;ince I received your letter I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many days without an&s;wering it.</P>
<P>I think there is no great difficulty in re&s;olving your doubts. The rea&s;ons for which you are inclined to vi&s;it London, are, I think, not of &s;ufficient &s;trength to an&s;wer the objections. That you &s;hould delight to come once a
<PB N="434" REF="465" MS="y">
 year to the fountain of intelligence and plea&s;ure, is very natural; but both information and plea&s;ure mu&s;t be regulated by propriety. Plea&s;ure, which cannot be obtained but by un&s;ea&s;onable or un&s;uitable expence, mu&s;t always end in pain; and plea&s;ure, which mu&s;t be enjoyed at the expence of another's pain, can never be &s;uch as a worthy mind can fully delight in.</P>
<P>What improvement you might gain by coming to London, you may ea&s;ily &s;upply, or ea&s;ily compen&s;ate, by enjoining your&s;elf &s;ome particular &s;tudy at home, or opening &s;ome new avenue to information. Edinburgh is not yet exhau&s;ted; and I am &s;ure you will find no plea&s;ure here which can de&s;erve either that you &s;hould anticipate any part of your future fortune, or that you &s;hould condemn your&s;elf and your lady to penurious frugality for the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P>I need not tell you what regard you owe to Mrs. Bo&s;well's entreaties; or how much you ought to &s;tudy the happine&s;s of her who &s;tudies yours with &s;o much diligence, and of who&s;e kindne&s;s you enjoy &s;uch good effects. Life cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ociety but by reciprocal conce&s;&s;ions. She permitted you to ramble la&s;t year, you mu&s;t permit her now to keep you at home.</P>
<P>Your la&s;t rea&s;on is &s;o &s;erious, that I am unwilling to oppo&s;e it. Yet you mu&s;t remember, that your image of wor&s;hipping once a year in a certain place, in imitation of the Jews, is but a compari&s;on, and <HI>&s;imile non e&s;t idem;</HI> if the annual re&s;ort to Jeru&s;alem was a duty to the Jews, it was a duty becau&s;e it was commanded; and you have no &s;uch command, therefore no &s;uch duty. It may be dangerous to receive too readily, and indulge too fondly, opinions, from which, perhaps, no pious mind is wholly di&s;engaged, of local &s;anctity and local devotion. You know what &s;trange effects they have produced over a great part of the Chri&s;tian world. I am now writing, and you, when you read this, are reading under the Eye of Omnipre&s;ence.</P>
<P>To what degree fancy is to be admitted into religious offices, it would require much deliberation to determine. I am far from intending totally to exclude it. Fancy is a faculty be&s;towed by our Creator, and it is rea&s;onable that all his gifts &s;hould be u&s;ed to his glory, that all our faculties &s;hould co-operate in his wor&s;hip; but they are to co-operate according to the will of him that gave them, according to the order which his wi&s;dom has e&s;tabli&s;hed. As ceremonies prudential or convenient are le&s;s obligatory than po&s;itive ordi|nances, as bodily wor&s;hip is only the token to others or our&s;elves of mental adoration, &s;o Fancy is always to act in &s;ubordination to Rea&s;on. We may take Fancy for a companion, but mu&s;t follow Rea&s;on as our guide. We may
<PB N="435" REF="466" MS="y">
allow Fancy to &s;ugge&s;t certain ideas in certain places, but Rea&s;on mu&s;t always be heard, when &s;he tells us, that tho&s;e ideas and tho&s;e places have no natural or nece&s;&s;ary relation. When we enter a church we habitually recal to mind the duty of adoration, but we mu&s;t not omit adoration for want of a temple&punc; becau&s;e we know, and ought to remember, that the Univer&s;al Lord is every where pre&s;ent; and that, therefore, to come to Jona, or to Jeru&s;alem, though it may be u&s;eful, cannot be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Thus I have an&s;wered your letter, and have not an&s;wered it negligently. I love you too well to be carele&s;s when you are &s;erious.</P>
<P>I think I &s;hall be very diligent next week about our travels, which I have too long neglected.</P>

<P>I WISH you could have looked over my book before the printer, but it could not ea&s;ily be. I &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;takes; but as I deal, perhaps,
<PB N="437" REF="468" MS="y">
more in notions than facts, the matter is not great, and the &s;econd edition will be mended, if any &s;uch there be. The pre&s;s will go on &s;lowly for a time, becau&s;e I am going into Wales to-morrow.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very &s;orry if I appeared to treat &s;uch a character as that of Lord Hailes otherwi&s;e than with high re&s;pect. I return the &s;heets <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">On the cover enclo&s;ing them, Dr. John&s;on wrote, <Q REND="inline">"If my delay has given any rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that I have not a very deep &s;en&s;e of the honour done me by a&s;king my judgement, I am very &s;orry."</Q></NOTE>, to which I have done what mi&s;chief I could; and finding it &s;o little, thought not much of &s;ending them. The narrative is clear, lively, and &s;hort.</P>
<P>I have done wor&s;e to Lord Hailes than by neglecting his &s;heets: I have run him in debt. Dr. Horne, the Pre&s;ident of Magdalen College in Oxford, wrote to me about three months ago, that he purpo&s;ed to reprint Walton's Lives, and de&s;ired me to contribute to the work: my an&s;wer was, that Lord Hailes intended the &s;ame publication; and Dr. Horne has re&s;igned it to him. His Lord&s;hip now mu&s;t think &s;eriou&s;ly about it.</P>
<P>Of poor dear Dr. Gold&s;mith there is little to be told, more than the papers have made publick. He died of a fever, made, I am afraid, more violent by unea&s;ine&s;s of mind. His debts began to be heavy, and all his re&s;ources were exhau&s;ted. Sir Jo&s;hua is of opinion that he owed not le&s;s than two thou&s;and pounds. Was ever poet &s;o tru&s;ted before?</P>
<P>You may, if you plea&s;e, put the in&s;cription thus:</P>
<P>'Maria Scotorum Regina nata <HI>15</HI>&mdash;, a &s;uis in exilium acta <HI>15</HI>&mdash;, ab ho&s;pit&acirc; neci data <HI>15</HI>&mdash;.' <HI>You mu&s;t find the years.</HI></P>
<P>Of your &s;econd daughter you certainly gave the account your&s;elf, though you have forgotten it. While Mrs. Bo&s;well is well, never doubt of a boy. Mrs. Thrale brought, I think, five girls running, but while I was with you &s;he had a boy.</P>

I now &s;end a few more leaves of the Annals, which I hope you will peru&s;e, and return with ob&s;ervations, as you did upon the former occa&s;ion. Lord Hailes writes to me thus: <Q REND="inline">'Mr. Bo&s;well will be plea&s;ed to expre&s;s the grateful &s;en&s;e which Sir David Dalrymple has of Dr. John&s;on's attention to his little &s;pecimen. The further &s;pecimen will &s;hew, that
<Q><L>'Even in an <HI>Edward</HI> he can &s;ee de&s;ert.'</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>It gives me much plea&s;ure to hear that a re-publication of I&s;aac Walton's Lives is intended. You have been in a mi&s;take in thinking that Lord Hailes had it in view. I remember one forenoon, while he &s;at with you in my hou&s;e, he &s;aid, that there &s;hould be a new edition of Walton's Lives; and you &s;aid, that they &s;hould be benoted a little. This was all that pa&s;&s;ed on that &s;ubject. You mu&s;t, therefore, inform Dr. Horne, that he may re&s;ume his plan. I enclo&s;e a note concerning it; and if Dr. Horne will write to me, all the attention that I can give &s;hall be cheerfully be&s;towed, upon what I think a pious work, the pre&s;ervation and elucidation of Walton, by who&s;e writings I have been mo&s;t plea&s;ingly edified.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I returned from my Welch journey. I was &s;orry to leave my book &s;u&s;pended &s;o long; but having an opportunity of &s;ee|ing, with &s;o much convenience, a new part of the i&s;land, I could not reject it. I have been in five of the &s;ix counties of North Wales; and have &s;een St. A&s;aph and Bangor, the two &s;eats of their bi&s;hops; have been upon Pen|manmaur and Snowden, and pa&s;&s;ed over into Angle&s;ea. But Wales is &s;o little different from England, that it offers nothing to the &s;peculation of the traveller.</P>
<P>When I came home, I found &s;everal of your papers, with &s;ome pages of Lord Hailes's Annals, which I will con&s;ider. I am in ha&s;te to give you &s;ome account of my&s;elf, le&s;t you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect me of negligence in the pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s which I find recommended to my care <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">I had written to him, to reque&s;t his interpo&s;ition in behalf of a convict, who I thought was very unju&s;tly condemned.</NOTE>, and which I knew nothing of till now, when all care is vain.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tribution of my books I purpo&s;e to follow your advice, adding &s;uch as &s;hall occur to me. I am not plea&s;ed with your notes of remembrance added to your names, for I hope I &s;hall not ea&s;ily forget them.</P>
<P>I have received four Er&s;e books, without any direction, and &s;u&s;pect that they are intended for the Oxford library. If that is the intention, I think it will be proper to add the metrical p&s;alms, and whatever el&s;e is printed in Er&s;e, that the pre&s;ent may be complete. The donor's name &s;hould be told.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you could have read the book before it was printed, but our di&s;|tance does not ea&s;ily permit it.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry Lord Hailes does not intend to publi&s;h Walton; I am afraid it will not be done &s;o well, if it be done at all.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;e now to drive the book forward. Make my compliments to Mrs. Bo&s;well, and let me hear often from you.</P>

 This tour to Wales, which was made in company with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, though it no doubt contributed to his health and amu&s;ement, did not give occa&s;ion to &s;uch a di&s;cur&s;ive exerci&s;e of his mind as our tour to the Hebrides. I do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he &s;aw there. All that I heard him &s;ay of it was, that in&s;tead of bleak and barren mountains, there were green and fertile ones; and that one of the ca&s;tles in Wales would contain all the ca&s;tles that he had &s;een in Scotland.</P>
<P>Parliament having been di&s;&s;olved, and his friend Mr. Thrale, who was a &s;teady &s;upporter of government, having again to encounter the &s;torm of a conte&s;ted election, he wrote a &s;hort political pamphlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">"The Patriot, *"</Q> addre&s;&s;ed to the electors of Great-Britain; a title which, to factious men, who con&s;ider a patriot only as an oppo&s;er of the mea&s;ures of government, will appear &s;trangely mi&s;applied. It was, however, written with energetick viva|city; and, except tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in which it endeavours to vindicate the glaring outrage of the Hou&s;e of Commons in the ca&s;e of the Middle&s;ex election, and to ju&s;tify the attempt to reduce our fellow-&s;ubjects in America to uncon|ditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it contained an admirable di&s;play of the properties of a real patriot, in the original and genuine &s;en&s;e,&mdash;a &s;incere, &s;teady, rational, and unbia&s;&s;ed friend to the intere&s;ts and pro&s;perity of his King and country. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, that both in this and his two former pamphlets, there was, amid&s;t many powerful arguments, not only a con&s;ider|able portion of &s;ophi&s;try, but a contemptuous ridicule of his opponents, which was very provoking.</P>

<P>BE plea&s;ed to accept of my be&s;t thanks for your 'Journey to the Hebrides,' which came to me by la&s;t night's po&s;t.

I &s;hall only &s;ay, that your book has afforded me a high gratification. I &s;hall afterwards give you my thoughts on particular pa&s;&s;ages. In the mean time, I ha&s;ten to tell you of your having mi&s;taken two names, which you will cor|rect in London, as I &s;hall do here, that the gentlemen who de&s;erve the valu|able compliments which you have paid them, may enjoy their honours.

<P>But I am now to apply to you for immediate aid in my profe&s;&s;ion, which you have never refu&s;ed to grant when I reque&s;ted it.

<P>The fact is &s;hortly this. In a tran&s;lation of the charter of the Infirmary from Latin into Engli&s;h, made under the authority of the managers, the &s;ame phra&s;e in the original is in one place rendered <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> but when applied to Dr. Memis is rendered <HI>Doctor of Medicine.</HI> Dr. Memis complained of this

It is confidently told here, that before your book came out he &s;ent to you, to let you know that he under&s;tood you meant to deny the authenticity of O&s;&s;ian's Poems; that the originals were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that you might have in&s;pection of them, and might take the evidence of people &s;killed in the Er&s;e language; and that he hoped, after this fair offer, you would not be &s;o uncandid as to a&s;&s;ert that he had refu&s;ed rea&s;onable proof. That you paid no regard to his me&s;&s;age, but publi&s;hed your &s;trong attack upon him; that then he wrote a letter to you, in
<PB N="447" REF="478">
&s;uch terms as he thought &s;uited to one who had not acted as a man of vera|city. You may believe it gives me pain to hear your conduct repre&s;ented as unfavourable, while I can only deny what is &s;aid, on the ground that your character refutes it, without having any information to oppo&s;e. Let me, I beg it of you, be furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to any calumny upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord Hailes writes to me, (for we corre&s;pond more than we talk toge|ther,) <Q REND="inline">'As to Fingal, I &s;ee a controver&s;y ari&s;ing, and purpo&s;e to keep out of its way.

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Macpher&s;on little knew the character of Dr. John&s;on, if he &s;uppo&s;ed that he could be ea&s;ily intimidated; for no man was ever more remarkable for per&s;onal courage. He had, indeed, an aweful dread of death, or rather <Q REND="inline">"of &s;omething after death;"</Q> and what rational man, who &s;eriou&s;ly thinks of quitting all that he has ever known, and going into a new and unknown &s;tate of being, can be without that dread? But his fear was from reflection, his courage natural. His fear, in that one in&s;tance, was the re&s;ult of philo&s;ophical and religious con&s;ideration. He feared death, but he feared nothing el&s;e, not even what might occa&s;ion death. Many in&s;tances of his re&s;olution may be men|tioned. One day, at Mr. Beauclerk's hou&s;e in the country, when two large dogs were fighting, he went up to them, and beat them till they &s;eparated; and at another time, when told of the danger there was that a gun might bur&s;t if charged with many balls, he put in &s;ix or &s;even, and fired it off again&s;t a wall. Mr. Langton told me, that when they were &s;wimming together near Oxford, he cautioned Dr. John&s;on again&s;t a pool, which was reckoned par|ticularly dangerous; upon which John&s;on directly &s;wam into it. He told me him&s;elf that one night he was attacked in the &s;treet by four men, to whom he would not yield, but kept them all at bay, till the watch came up, and carried both him and them to the round-hou&s;e. In the play-hou&s;e at Lich|field, as Mr. Garrick informed me, John&s;on having for a moment quitted a chair which was placed for him between the &s;ide-&s;cenes, a gentleman took
<PB N="450" REF="481">
 po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and when John&s;on on his return civilly demanded his &s;eat, rudely refu&s;ed to give it up; upon which John&s;on laid hold of him, and to&s;&s;ed him and the chair into the pit. Foote, who &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully revived the old comedy, by exhibiting living characters, had re&s;olved to imitate John&s;on on the &s;tage, expecting great profits from his ridicule of &s;o celebrated a man. John&s;on being informed of his intention, and being at dinner at Mr. Thomas Davies's the book&s;eller, from whom I had the &s;tory, he a&s;ked Mr. Davies <Q REND="inline">"what was the common price of an oak &s;tick;"</Q> and being an&s;wered &s;ix-pence, <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, (&s;aid he,) give me leave to &s;end your &s;ervant to purcha&s;e me a &s;hil|ling one. I'll have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to <HI>take me off,</HI> as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow &s;hall not do it with impunity."</Q> Davies took care to acquaint Foote of this, which effectually checked the wan|tonne&s;s of the mimick. Mr. Macpher&s;on's menaces made John&s;on provide him&s;elf with the &s;ame implement of defence; and had he been attacked, I have no doubt that, old as he was, he would have made his corporal prowe&s;s be felt as much as his intellectual.</P>
<P>His <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland, *"</Q> is a mo&s;t valuable performance. It abounds in exten&s;ive philo&s;ophical views of &s;ociety, and in ingenious &s;entiments and lively de&s;cription. A con&s;iderable part of it, indeed, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;peculations, which many years before he &s;aw the wild regions which we vi&s;ited together, probably had employed his attention, though the actual &s;ight of tho&s;e &s;cenes undoubtedly quickened and augmented them. Mr. Orme, the very able hi&s;torian, agreed with me in this opinion, which he thus &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;"<Q REND="inline">There are in that book thoughts, which, by long revolution in the great mind of John&s;on, have been formed and poli&s;hed like pebbles rolled in the ocean!"</Q></P>
<P>That he was to &s;ome degree of exce&s;s a <HI>true-born Engli&s;hman,</HI> &s;o as to have ever entertained an undue prejudice again&s;t both the country and the people of Scotland, mu&s;t be allowed. But it was a prejudice of the head, and not of the heart. He had no ill will to the Scotch; for, if he had been con&s;cious of that, he would never have thrown him&s;elf into the bo&s;om of their country, and tru&s;ted to the protection of its remote inhabitants with a fearle&s;s confi|dence. His remark upon the nakedne&s;s of the country, from its being denuded of trees, was made after having travelled two hundred miles along the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, where certainly trees are not to be found near the road, and he &s;aid it was <Q REND="inline">"a map of the road"</Q> which he gave. His di&s;belief of the authenticity of the poems a&s;cribed to O&s;&s;ian, a Highland bard, was confirmed in the cour&s;e of his journey, by a very &s;trict examination of the evidence offered for it; and although
<PB N="451" REF="482">
their authenticity was made too much a national point by the Scotch, there were many re&s;pectable per&s;ons in that country who did not concur in this; &s;o that his judgement upon the que&s;tion ought not to be decried, even by tho&s;e who differ from him. As to my&s;elf, I can only &s;ay, upon a &s;ubject now become very unintere&s;ting, that when the fragments of Highland poetry fir&s;t came out, I was much plea&s;ed with their wild peculiarity, and was one of tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;cribed to enable their editor, Mr. Macpher&s;on, then a young man, to make a &s;earch in the Highlands and Hebrides for a long poem in the Er&s;e language, which was reported to be pre&s;erved &s;omewhere in tho&s;e regions. But when there came forth an Epick Poem in &s;ix books, with all the common circum&s;tances of former compo&s;itions of that nature; and when, upon an attentive examination of it, there was found a perpetual recurrence of the &s;ame images which appear in the fragments; and when no ancient manu&s;cript, to authenticate the work, was depo&s;ited in any publick library, though that was in&s;i&s;ted on as a rea&s;onable proof, <HI>who</HI> could forbear to doubt?</P>
<P>John&s;on's grateful acknowledgements of kindne&s;&s;es received in the cour&s;e of this tour, completely refute the brutal reflections which have been thrown out again&s;t him, as if he had made an ungrateful return; and his delicacy in &s;paring in his book tho&s;e who we find from his letters to Mrs. Thrale, were ju&s;t objects of cen&s;ure, is much to be admired. His candour and amiable di&s;|po&s;ition is con&s;picuous from his conduct, when informed by Mr. Macleod, of Ra&s;ay, that he had committed a mi&s;take, which gave that gentleman &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. He wrote him a courteous and kind letter, and in&s;erted in the new&s;papers an adverti&s;ement, correcting the mi&s;take <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">See <Q REND="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</Q> 3d edit. p. 520.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations of my friend Mr. Demp&s;ter in a letter written to me, &s;oon after he had read Dr. John&s;on's book, are &s;o ju&s;t and liberal, that they cannot be too often repeated:</P>
<P>* * * * * *</P>
<Q><P>There is nothing in the book, from beginning to end, that a Scotchman need to take ami&s;s. What he &s;ays of the country is true; and his ob&s;ervations on the people are what mu&s;t naturally occur to a &s;en&s;ible, ob&s;erving, and reflecting inhabitant of a convenient metropolis, where a man on thirty pounds a year may be better accommodated with all the little wants of life, than Col or Sir Allan.</P>
<P>I am charmed with his re&s;earches concerning the Er&s;e language, and the antiquity of their manu&s;cripts. I am quite convinced; and I &s;hall rank O&s;&s;ian,
<PB N="452" REF="483">
 and his Fingals and O&s;cars, among&s;t the nur&s;ery tales, not the true hi&s;tory of our country, in all time to come.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the book cannot di&s;plea&s;e, for it has no preten&s;ions. The authour neither &s;ays he is a geographer, nor an antiquarian, nor very learned in the hi&s;tory of Scotland, nor a naturali&s;t, nor a fo&s;&s;ili&s;t. The man|ners of the people, and the face of the country, are all he attempts to de&s;cribe, or &s;eems to have thought of. Much were it to be wi&s;hed, that they who have travelled into more remote, and of cour&s;e more curious regions, had all po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed his good &s;en&s;e. Of the &s;tate of learning, his ob&s;ervations on Gla&s;gow Univer&s;ity &s;hew he has formed a very &s;ound judgement. He under&s;tands our climate too; and he has accurately ob&s;erved the changes, however &s;low and imperceptible to us, which Scotland has undergone, in con&s;equence of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and internal peace.</P></Q>
<P>* * * * * *</P>
<P>Mr. Knox, another native of Scotland, who has &s;ince made the &s;ame tour, and publi&s;hed an account of it, is equally liberal. <Q REND="inline">"I have read (&s;ays he,) his book again and again, travelled with him from Berwick to Glenelg, through countries with which I am well acquainted; &s;ailed with him from Glenelg to Ra&s;ay, Sky, Rum, Col, Mull, and Icolmkill, but have not been able to correct him in any matter of con&s;equence. I have often admired the accuracy, the preci&s;ion, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of what he advances, re&s;pecting both the country and the people.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The Doctor has every where delivered his &s;entiments with freedom, and in many in&s;tances with a &s;eeming regard for the benefit of the inhabitants, and the ornament of the country. His remarks on the want of trees and hedges for &s;hade, as well as for &s;helter to the cattle, are well founded, and merit the thanks, not the illiberal cen&s;ure of the natives. He al&s;o felt for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Highlanders, and explodes, with great propriety, the bad management of the grounds, and the neglect of timber in the Hebrides."</Q></P>
<P>Having quoted John&s;on's ju&s;t compliments on the Ra&s;ay family, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"On the other hand, I found this family equally lavi&s;h in their encomiums upon the Doctor's conver&s;ation, and his &s;ub&s;equent civilities to a young gentle|man of that country, who, upon waiting upon him at London, was well received, and experienced all the attention and regard that a warm friend could be&s;tow. Mr. Macleod having al&s;o been in London, waited upon the Doctor, who provided a magnificent and expen&s;ive entertainment, in honour of his old Hebridean acquaintance."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="484" MS="y">
And talking of the military road by Fort Augu&s;tus, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"By this road,  though one of the mo&s;t rugged in Great-Britain, the celebrated Dr. John&s;on pa&s;&s;ed from Inverne&s;s to the Hebride I&s;les. His ob&s;ervations on the country and people are extremely correct, judicious, and in&s;tructive <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Page 103.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>His private letters to Mrs. Thrale, written during the cour&s;e of his journey, which therefore may be &s;uppo&s;ed to convey his genuine feelings at the time, abound in &s;uch benignant &s;entiments towards the people who &s;hewed him civilities, that no man who&s;e temper is not very har&s;h and &s;our, can retain a doubt of the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>It is painful to recollect with what rancour he was a&s;&s;ailed by numbers of &s;hallow irritable North-Britons, on account of his &s;uppo&s;ed injurious treat|ment of their country and countrymen, in his <Q REND="inline">"Journey."</Q> Had there been any ju&s;t ground for &s;uch a charge, would the virtuous and candid Demp&s;ter have given his opinion of the book, in the terms which I have quoted? Would the patriotick Knox<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">I ob&s;erve with much regret, while this work is pa&s;&s;ing through the pre&s;s, (Augu&s;t, 1790,) that this ingenious gentleman is dead.</NOTE> have &s;poken of it as he has done? And let me add, that, citizen of the world as I hold my&s;elf to be, I have that degree of predilection for my <HI>natale &s;olum,</HI> nay, I have that ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the merit of an ancient nation, which has been ever renowned for its valour, which in former times maintained its independence again&s;t a powerful neighbour, and in modern times has been equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for its ingenuity and indu&s;try in civili&s;ed life, that I &s;hould have felt a generous indignation at any inju&s;tice done to it. John&s;on treated Scotland no wor&s;e than he did even his be&s;t friends, who&s;e characters he u&s;ed to give as they appeared to him, both in light and &s;hade. Some peo|ple, who had not exerci&s;ed their minds &s;ufficiently, condemned him for cen|&s;uring his friends. But Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who&s;e philo&s;ophical penetration and ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking are not le&s;s known to tho&s;e who live with him, than his genius in his art is admired by the world, explained his conduct thus: <Q REND="inline">"He was fond of di&s;crimination, which he could not &s;hew without pointing out the bad as well as the good in every character; and as his friends were tho&s;e who&s;e characters he knew be&s;t, they afforded him the be&s;t opportunity for &s;hewing the acutene&s;s of his judgement."</Q></P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed to his friend Mr. Windham of Norfolk, his wonder at the extreme jealou&s;y of the Scotch, and their re&s;entment at having their country de&s;cribed by him as it really was; when, to &s;ay that it was a country as good
<PB N="454" REF="485" MS="y">
 as England, would have been a gro&s;s fal&s;ehood. <Q REND="inline">"None of us, (&s;aid he,) would be offended if a foreigner who has travelled here &s;hould &s;ay, that vines and olives don't grow in England."</Q> And as to his prejudice again&s;t the Scotch, which I always a&s;cribed to that nationality which he ob&s;erved in <HI>them,</HI> he &s;aid to the &s;ame gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"When I find a Scotchman to whom an Engli&s;hman is as a Scotchman, that Scotchman &s;hall be as an Engli&s;hman to me."</Q> His intimacy with many gentlemen of Scotland, and his employing &s;o many natives of that country as his amanuen&s;es, prove that his prejudice was not virulent&punc; and I have depo&s;ited in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, among&s;t other pieces of his writing, the following note, in an&s;wer to one from me, a&s;king if he would meet me at dinner at the Mitre, though a friend of mine, a Scotchman, was to be there:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. John&s;on does not &s;ee why Mr. Bo&s;well &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a Scotchman le&s;s acceptable than any other man. He will be at the Mitre."</Q></P>
<P>My much-valued friend Dr. Barnard, now Bi&s;hop of Killaloe, having once expre&s;&s;ed to him an apprehen&s;ion, that if he &s;hould vi&s;it Ireland he might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he had done the Scotch, he an&s;wered, with &s;trong pointed double-edged wit, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have no rea&s;on to be afraid of me. The Iri&s;h are not in a con&s;piracy to cheat the world by fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the merits of their countrymen. No, Sir; the Iri&s;h are a FAIR PEOPLE:&mdash;they never &s;peak well of one another."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on told me an in&s;tance of Scotti&s;h nationality, which made a very unfa|vourable impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind. A Scotchman, of &s;ome con&s;ideration in London, &s;olicited him to recommend, by the weight of his learned authority, to be ma&s;ter of an Engli&s;h &s;chool, a per&s;on of whom he who recommended him confe&s;&s;ed he knew no more but that he was his countryman. John&s;on was &s;hocked at this uncon&s;cientious conduct.</P>
<P>All the mi&s;erable cavillings again&s;t his <Q REND="inline">"Journey,"</Q> in new&s;papers, maga|zines, and other fugitive publications, I can &s;peak from certain knowledge, only furni&s;hed him with &s;port. At la&s;t there came out a &s;currilous volume, larger than John&s;on's own, filled with malignant abu&s;e, under a name, real or fictitious, of &s;ome low man in an ob&s;cure corner of Scotland, though &s;uppo&s;ed to be the work of another Scotchman, who has found means to make him&s;elf well known both in Scotland and England. The effect which it had upon John&s;on was, to produce this plea&s;ant ob&s;ervation to Mr. Seward, to whom he lent the book: <Q REND="inline">"This fellow mu&s;t be a blockhead. They don't know how to go about their abu&s;e. Who will read a five &s;hilling book again&s;t me? No, Sir, if they had wit, they &s;hould have kept pelting me with pamphlets."</Q></P>

<P>I find that the Highlanders and Hebrideans in general are much fonder of your 'Journey,' than the low-country or <HI>hither</HI> Scots. One of the Grants &s;aid to day, that he was &s;ure you were a man of a good heart, and a candid man, and &s;eemed to hope he &s;hould be able to convince you of the antiquity of a good proportion of the poems of O&s;&s;ian. After all that has pa&s;&s;ed, I think the matter is capable of being proved to a certain degree. I am told that Macpher&s;on got one old Er&s;e MS. from Clanranald, for the re&s;titution of which he executed a formal obligation; and it is affirmed, that the Gaelick (call it Er&s;e or call it Iri&s;h,) has been written in the Highlands and Hebrides for many centuries. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch of the inhabitants as acquired any learning, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of writing as well as their Iri&s;h neigh|bours and Celtick cou&s;ins; and the que&s;tion is, can &s;ufficient evidence be &s;hewn of this?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are &s;killed in ancient writings can determine the age of MSS. or at lea&s;t can a&s;certain the century in which they were written; and if men of veracity, who are &s;o &s;killed, &s;hall tell us that MSS. in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of families in the Highlands and i&s;les, are the works of a remote age, I think we &s;hould be convinced by their te&s;timony.</P>
<P>There is now come to this city, Ranald Macdonald, from the I&s;le of Egg, who has &s;everal MSS. of Er&s;e poetry, which he wi&s;hes to publi&s;h by &s;ub&s;cription. I have engaged to take three copies of the book, the price of
<PB N="456" REF="487">
 which is to be &s;ix &s;hillings, as I would &s;ub&s;cribe for all the Er&s;e that can be printed, be it old or new, that the language may be pre&s;erved. This man &s;ays, that &s;ome of his manu&s;cripts are ancient; and, to be &s;ure, one of them which was &s;hewn to me does appear to have the du&s;kyne&s;s of antiquity.</P>
<P>* * * * * *</P>
<P>The inquiry is not yet quite hopele&s;s, and I &s;hould think that the exact truth may be di&s;covered, if proper means be u&s;ed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry that I could get no books for my friends in Scotland. Mr. Strahan has at la&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;end two dozen to you. If they come, put the names of my friends into them; you may cut them out <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">From a li&s;t in his hand-writing.</NOTE>, and pa&s;te them with a little &s;tarch in the book.</P>
<P>You then are going wild about O&s;&s;ian. Why do you think any part can be proved? The du&s;ky manu&s;cript of Egg is probably not fifty years old; if it be an hundred, it proves nothing. The tale of Clanranald has no proof. Has Clanranald told it? Can he prove it? There are, I believe, no Er&s;e manu&s;cripts. None of the old families had a &s;ingle letter in Er&s;e that we heard of. You &s;ay it is likely that they could write. The learned, if any learned there were, could; but knowing by that learning &s;ome written lan|guage, in that language they wrote, as letters had never been applied to their own. If there are manu&s;cripts, let them be &s;hewn, with &s;ome proof that they are not forged for the occa&s;ion. You &s;ay many can remember parts of O&s;&s;ian. I believe all tho&s;e parts are ver&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, at lea&s;t there is no proof of their antiquity.</P>
<P>Macpher&s;on is &s;aid to have made &s;ome tran&s;lations him&s;elf; and having taught a boy to write it, ordered him to &s;ay that he had learned it of his grand|mother. The boy, when he grew up, told the &s;tory. This Mrs. Williams heard at Mr. Strahan's table. Do not be credulous; you know how little a Highlander can be tru&s;ted. Macpher&s;on is, &s;o far as I know, very quiet. Is not that proof enough? Every thing is again&s;t him. No vi&s;ible manu&s;cript; no in&s;cription in the language: no corre&s;pondence among friends: no tran&s;|action of bu&s;ine&s;s, of which a &s;ingle &s;crap remains in the ancient families. Macpher&s;on's pretence is, that the character was Saxon. If he had not talked
<PB N="457" REF="488" MS="y">
un&s;kilfully of <HI>manu&s;cripts,</HI> he might have fought with oral tradition much longer. As to Mr. Grant's information, I &s;uppo&s;e he knows much le&s;s of the matter than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the book&s;eller &s;ays that the &s;ale<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Of his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland."</Q></NOTE> is &s;ufficiently quick. They printed four thou&s;and. Correct your copy wherever it is wrong, and bring it up. Your friends will all be glad to &s;ee you. I think of going my|&s;elf into the country about May.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that I have not managed to &s;end the books &s;ooner. I have left four for you, and do not re&s;trict you ab&s;olutely to follow my directions in the di&s;tribution. You mu&s;t u&s;e your own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Make my compliments to Mrs. Bo&s;well; I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is now ju&s;t begin|ning to forgive me.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On Tue&s;day, March 21, I arrived in London; and on repairing to Dr. John&s;on's before dinner, found him in his &s;tudy, &s;itting with Mr. Peter Garrick, the elder brother of David, &s;trongly re&s;embling him in his counte|nance and voice, but of more &s;edate and placid manners. John&s;on informed me, that <Q REND="inline">"though Mr. Beauclerk was in great pain, it was hoped he was not in danger, and that he now wi&s;hed to con&s;ult Dr. Heberden to try the effect of a <HI>new under&s;tanding."</HI></Q> Both at this interview, and in the evening at Mr. Thrale's, where he and Mr. Peter Garrick and I met again, he was vehement on the &s;ub|ject of the O&s;&s;ian controver&s;y; ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"We do not know that there are any ancient Er&s;e manu&s;cripts; and we have no other rea&s;on to di&s;believe that there are men with three heads, but that we do not know that there are any &s;uch men."</Q> He al&s;o was outrageous, upon his &s;uppo&s;ition that my countrymen <Q REND="inline">"loved Scotland better than truth,"</Q> &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"All of them,&mdash;nay not all,&mdash;but <HI>droves</HI> of them, would come up, and atte&s;t any thing for the honour of Scotland."</Q> He al&s;o per&s;evered in his wild allegation, that he que&s;tioned if there was a tree between Edinburgh and the Engli&s;h border older than him&s;elf. I a&s;&s;ured him he was mi&s;taken, and &s;ugge&s;ted that the proper puni&s;hment would be that he &s;hould receive a &s;tripe at every tree above a hundred years old, that was found within that &s;pace. He laughed, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I believe I might &s;ubmit to it for a <HI>bawbie!"</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="489" MS="y">
 The doubts which, in my corre&s;pondence with him, I had ventured to &s;tate as to the ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom of the conduct of Great-Britain towards the American colonies, while I at the &s;ame time reque&s;ted that he would enable me to inform my&s;elf upon that momentous &s;ubject, he had altogether di&s;re|garded; and had recently publi&s;hed a pamphlet, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny; an An&s;wer to the Re&s;olutions and Addre&s;s of the American Congre&s;s. *"</Q></P>
<P>He had long before indulged mo&s;t unfavourable &s;entiments of our fellow &s;ubjects in America: For, as early as 1769, I was told by Dr. John Campbell, that he had &s;aid of them, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, they are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them &s;hort of hanging."</Q></P>
<P>Of this performance I avoided to talk with him; for I had now formed a clear and &s;ettled opinion, that the people of America were well warranted to re&s;i&s;t a claim that their fellow-&s;ubjects in the mother-country &s;hould have the entire command of their fortunes, by taxing them without their own con&s;ent; and the extreme violence which it breathed, appeared to me &s;o un&s;uitable to the mildne&s;s of a Chri&s;tian philo&s;opher, and &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to the principles of peace which he had &s;o beautifully recommended in his pamphlet re&s;pecting Falkland's I&s;lands, that I was &s;orry to &s;ee him appear in &s;o unfa|vourable a light. Be&s;ides; I could not perceive in it that ability of argument, or that felicity of expre&s;&s;ion, for which he was, upon other occa&s;ions, &s;o emi|nent. Po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, &s;arca&s;tical &s;everity, and extravagant ridicule, which he him&s;elf reprobated as a te&s;t of truth, were united in this rhap&s;ody.</P>
<P>That this pamphlet was written at the de&s;ire of tho&s;e who were then in power, I have no doubt; and, indeed, he owned to me, that it had been revi&s;ed and curtailed by &s;ome of them. He told me, that they had &s;truck out one pa&s;&s;age, which was to this effect: <Q REND="inline">"That the Coloni&s;ts could with no &s;olidity argue from their not having been taxed while in their infancy, that they &s;hould not now be taxed. We do not put a calf into the plow&punc; we wait till he is an ox."</Q> He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They &s;truck it out either critically, as too ludicrous, or politically, as too exa&s;perating. I care not which. It was their bu&s;ine&s;s. If an architect &s;ays, I will build five &s;tories, and the man who employs him &s;ays, I will have only three, the employer is to decide."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, (&s;aid I,) in ordinary ca&s;es. But &s;hould it be &s;o when the archi|tect gives his &s;kill and labour <HI>gratis?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>Unfavourable as I am con&s;trained to &s;ay my opinion of this pamphlet was, yet, &s;ince it was congenial with the &s;entiments of numbers at that time, and as every thing relating to the writings of Dr. John&s;on is of importance in
<PB N="459" REF="490">
literary hi&s;tory, I &s;hall therefore in&s;ert &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages which were &s;truck out, it does not appear why, either by him&s;elf or tho&s;e who revi&s;ed it. They appear printed in a few proof leaves of it in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, marked with corrections in his own hand-writing. I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h them by <HI>Italicks.</HI></P>
<P>In the paragraph where he &s;ays, the Americans were incited to re&s;i&s;tance by European intelligence from <Q REND="inline">"men whom they thought their friends, but who were friends only to them&s;elves,"</Q> there followed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>"and made, by their &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, the enemies of their country."</HI></Q></P>
<P>And the next paragraph ran thus: <Q REND="inline">"On the original contrivers of mi&s;chief, <HI>rather than on tho&s;e whom they have deluded,</HI> let an in&s;ulted nation pour out its vengeance."</Q></P>
<P><HI>The paragraph which came next was in the&s;e words:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Unhappy is that country, in which men can hope for advancement by favouring its enemies. The tranquillity of &s;table government is not always ea&s;ily pre&s;erved again&s;t the machina|tions of &s;ingle innovators; but what can be the hope of quiet, when factions ho&s;tile to the legi&s;lature can be openly formed and openly avowed?"</Q></P>
<P>After the paragraph which now concludes the pamphlet, there followed this, in which he certainly means the great Earl of Chatham, and glances at a cer|tain popular Lord Chancellor:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If, by the fortune of war, they drive us utterly away, what they will do next can only be conjectured. If a new monarchy is erected, they will want a <HI>KING.</HI> He who fir&s;t takes into his hand the &s;ceptre of America, &s;hould have a name of good omen. <HI>WILLIAM</HI> has been known both as conqueror and deliverer; and perhaps England, however contemned, might yet &s;upply them with <HI>ANOTHER WILLIAM.</HI> Whigs, indeed, are not willing to be governed; and it is po&s;&s;ible that <HI>KING WILLIAM</HI> may be &s;trongly inclined to guide their mea&s;ures: but Whigs have been cheated like other mortals, and &s;uffered their leader to become their tyrant, under the name of their <HI>PROTECTOR.</HI> What more they will receive from England, no man can tell. In their rudiments of empire they may want a <HI>CHANCELLOR."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then came this paragraph:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Their numbers are, at pre&s;ent, not quite &s;ufficient for the greatne&s;s which, in &s;ome form of government or other, is to rival the ancient monarchies; but, by Dr. Franklin's rule of progre&s;&s;ion, they will, in a century and a quarter, be more than equal to the inhabitants of Europe. When the Whigs of America are thus multi|plied, let the Princes of the earth tremble in their palaces. If they &s;hould continue to double and to double, their own hemi&s;phere will not contain them. But let not our bolde&s;t oppugners of authority look forward with delight to this futurity of Whiggi&s;m."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="491">
 How it ended I know not, as it is cut off abruptly at the foot of the la&s;t of the&s;e proof pages.</P>
<P>His pamphlets in &s;upport of the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration were publi&s;hed on his own account, and he afterwards collected them into a volume, with the title of <Q REND="inline">"Political Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler,"</Q> with this motto,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"Fallitur egregio qui&s;quis &s;ub Principe credit</L>
<L>"Servitium, numquam libertas gratior extat</L>
<L>"Quam &s;ub Rege pio."</L>
<SIGNED>CLAUDIANUS.</SIGNED>
</LG></Q>
<P>The&s;e pamphlets drew upon him numerous attacks. Again&s;t the common weapons of literary warfare he was hardened; but there were two in&s;tances of animadver&s;ion which I communicated to him, and from what I could judge, both from his &s;ilence and his looks, appeared to me to impre&s;s him much.</P>
<P>One was, a <Q REND="inline">"A Letter to Dr. Samuel John&s;on, occa&s;ioned by his late political Publications."</Q> It appeared previous to his <Q REND="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny,"</Q> and was written by Dr. Jo&s;eph Towers. In that performance, Dr. John&s;on was treated with the re&s;pect due to &s;o eminent a man, while his conduct as a political writer was boldly and pointedly arraigned, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the cha|racter of one, who, if he did employ his pen upon politicks, <Q REND="inline">"it might rea|&s;onably be expected &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, not by party violence and rancour, but by moderation and by wi&s;dom."</Q></P>
<P>It concluded thus: <Q REND="inline">"I would, however, wi&s;h you to remember, &s;hould you again addre&s;s the publick under the character of a political writer, that luxuriance of imagination or energy of language will ill compen&s;ate for the want of candour, of ju&s;tice, and of truth. And I &s;hall only add, that &s;hould I here|after be di&s;po&s;ed to read, as I heretofore have done, the mo&s;t excellent of all your performances, 'THE RAMBLER,' the plea&s;ure which I have been accu&s;|tomed to find in it will be much dimini&s;hed by the reflection that the writer of &s;o moral, &s;o elegant, and &s;o valuable a work, was capable of pro&s;tituting his talents in &s;uch productions as 'The Fal&s;e Alarm,' the 'Thoughts on the Tran&s;actions re&s;pecting Falkland's I&s;lands,' and 'The Patriot."</Q></P>
<P>I am willing to do ju&s;tice to the merit of Dr. Towers, of whom I will &s;ay, that although I abhor his Whiggi&s;h democratical notions and propen&s;ities, (for I will not call them principles,) I e&s;teem him as an ingenious, knowing, and very convivial man.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance was a paragraph of a letter to me, from my old and mo&s;t intimate friend the Reverend Mr. Temple, who wrote the character of
<PB N="461" REF="492">
Gray, which has had the honour to be adopted both by Mr. Ma&s;on and Dr. John&s;on in their accounts of that poet. The words were, <Q REND="inline">"How can your great, I will not &s;ay your <HI>pious,</HI> but your <HI>moral</HI> friend, &s;upport the bar|barous mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, which they have not the face to a&s;k even their infidel pen&s;ioner Hume to defend."</Q></P>
<P>However confident of the rectitude of his own mind, John&s;on may have felt &s;incere unea&s;ine&s;s that his conduct &s;hould be erroneou&s;ly imputed to unwor|thy motives, by good men, and that the influence of his valuable writings &s;hould on that account be in any degree ob&s;tructed or le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>He complained to a Right Honourable friend of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents and very elegant manners, with whom he maintained a long intimacy, and who&s;e genero&s;ity towards him will afterwards appear, that his pen&s;ion having been given to him as a literary character, he had been applied to by admini&s;tra|tion to write political pamphlets; and he was even &s;o much irritated, that he delared his re&s;olution to re&s;ign his pen&s;ion. His friend &s;hewed him the impropriety of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and he afterwards expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude, and &s;aid he had received good advice. To that friend he once &s;ignified a wi&s;h to have his pen&s;ion &s;ecured to him for his life; but he neither a&s;ked nor received from government any reward what&s;oever for his political labours.</P>
<P>On Friday, March 24, I met him at the LITERARY CLUB, where were Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Mr. Colman, Dr. Percy, Mr. Ve&s;ey, Sir Charles Bunbury, Dr. George Fordyce, Mr. Steevens, and Mr. Charles Fox. Before he came in, we talked of his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands,"</Q> and of his coming away, <Q REND="inline">"willing to believe the &s;econd &s;ight <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland,"</Q> edit. 1785, p. 256.</NOTE>,"</Q> which &s;eemed to excite &s;ome ridicule. I was then &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the truth of many of the &s;tories of it which I had been told, that I avowed my conviction, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He is only <HI>willing</HI> to believe, I <HI>do</HI> believe. The evidence is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Are you? (&s;aid Colman,) then cork it up."</Q></P>
<P>I found his <Q REND="inline">"Journey"</Q> the common topick of conver&s;ation in London at this time, wherever I happened to be. At one of Lord Mansfield's formal Sunday evening conver&s;ations, &s;trangely called <HI>Lev&eacute;es,</HI> his Lord&s;hip addre&s;&s;ed me, <Q REND="inline">"We have all been reading your travels, Mr. Bo&s;well."</Q> I an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I was but the humble attendant of Dr. John&s;on."</Q> The Chief Ju&s;tice replied, with that air and manner which none, who ever &s;aw and heard him, can forget, <Q REND="inline">"He &s;peaks ill of nobody but O&s;&s;ian."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="493" MS="y">
 John&s;on was in high &s;pirits this evening at the club, and talked with great animation and &s;ucce&s;s. He attacked Swift, as he u&s;ed to do upon all occa&s;ions. <Q REND="inline">"The Tale of a Tub' is &s;o much &s;uperiour to his other writings, that one can hardly believe he was the authour of it. There is in it &s;uch a vigour of mind, &s;uch a &s;warm of thoughts, &s;o much of nature, and art, and life."</Q> I wondered to hear him &s;ay of <Q REND="inline">"Gulliver's Travels,"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"When once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very ea&s;y to do all the re&s;t."</Q> I endeavoured to make a &s;tand for Swift, and tried to rou&s;e tho&s;e who were much more able to defend him; but in vain. John&s;on at la&s;t of his own accord allowed very great merit to the inventory of articles found in the pockets of the Man Mountain, particularly the de&s;cription of his watch, which it was conjectured was his GOD, as he con&s;ulted it upon all occa&s;ions. He ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"Swift put his name to but two things, (after he had a name to put,) 'The Plan for the Improvement of the Engli&s;h Language,' and the la&s;t 'Drapier's Letter."</Q></P>
<P>From Swift, there was an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to Mr. Thomas Sheridan.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sheridan is a wonderful admirer of the tragedy of Douglas, and pre&s;ented its authour with a gold medal. Some years ago, at a coffee-hou&s;e in Oxford, I called to him, 'Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Sheridan, how came you to give a gold medal to Home, for writing that fooli&s;h play?' This, you &s;ee, was wanton and in&s;olent; but I <HI>meant</HI> to be wanton and in&s;olent. A medal has no value but as a &s;tamp of merit. And was Sheridan to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the right of giving that &s;tamp? If Sheridan was magnificent enough to be&s;tow a gold medal as an honorary reward of dramatick excellence, he &s;hould have reque&s;ted one of the Univer&s;ities to choo&s;e the per&s;on on whom it &s;hould be conferred. Sheridan had no right to give a &s;tamp of merit: it was coun|terfeiting Apollo's coin."</Q></P>
<P>On Monday, March 27, I breakfa&s;ted with him at Mr. Strahan's. He told us, that he was engaged to go that evening to Mrs. Abington's benefit. <Q REND="inline">"She was vi&s;iting &s;ome ladies whom I was vi&s;iting, and begged that I would come to her benefit. I told her I could not heat: but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much on my coming, that it would have been brutal to have refu&s;ed her."</Q> This was a &s;peech quite characteri&s;tical. He loved to bring forward his having been in the gay circles of life; and he was, perhaps, a little vain of the &s;olicitations of this elegant and fa&s;hionable actre&s;s. He told us, the play was to be <Q REND="inline">"The Hypocrite,"</Q> altered from Cibber's <Q REND="inline">"Nonjuror,"</Q> &s;o as to &s;atyrize the Methodi&s;ts. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think (&s;aid he,) the character of the Hypocrite ju&s;tly applicable to the Methodi&s;ts; but it was very applicable to the Nonjurors.
<PB N="463" REF="494" MS="y">
I once &s;aid to Dr. Madan, a clergyman of Ireland, who was a great Whig, that perhaps a Nonjuror would have been le&s;s criminal in taking the oaths impo&s;ed by the ruling power, than refu&s;ing them; becau&s;e refu&s;ing them, nece&s;|&s;arily laid him under almo&s;t an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to be more criminal; for, a man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> live, and if he precludes him&s;elf from the &s;upport furni&s;hed by the e&s;tabli&s;hment, will probably be reduced to very wicked &s;hifts to main|tain him&s;elf <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>This was not merely a cur&s;ory remark; for in his Life of Fenton he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"With many other wi&s;e and virtuous men, who at that time of di&s;cord and debate [about the beginning of this century,] con&s;ulted con&s;cience well or ill informed, more than intere&s;t, he doubted the legality of the government; and refu&s;ing to qualify him&s;elf for publick employment, by taking the oaths required, left the Univer&s;ity without a degree."</Q> This conduct, John&s;on calls <Q REND="inline">"perver&s;e|ne&s;s of integrity."</Q></P>
<P>The que&s;tion concerning the morality of taking oaths, of whatever kind, impo&s;ed by the prevail|ing power at the time, rather than to be excluded from all con&s;equence, or even any con&s;iderable u&s;efulne&s;s in &s;ociety, has been agitated with all the acutene&s;s of ca&s;ui&s;try. It is related, that he who devi&s;ed the oath of abjuration, profligately boa&s;ted, that he had framed a te&s;t which &s;hould damn one half of the nation, and &s;tarve the other. Upon minds not exalted to inflexible rectitude, or minds in which zeal for a party is predominant to exce&s;s, taking that oath again&s;t conviction, may have been palliated under the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, or ventured upon in heat, as upon the whole producing more good than evil.</P>
<P>At a county election in Scotland, many years ago, when there was a warm conte&s;t between the friends of the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and tho&s;e again&s;t it, the oath of abjuration having been demanded, the freeholders upon one &s;ide ro&s;e to go away. Upon which a very &s;anguine gentleman, one of their number, ran to the door to &s;top them, calling out with much earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Stay, &s;tay, my friends, and let us &s;wear the rogues out of it!"</Q></P></NOTE>."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould think, Sir, that a man who took the oaths contrary to his principles, was a determined wicked man, becau&s;e he was &s;ure he was committing perjury: whereas a Nonjuror might be in&s;en&s;ibly led to do what was wrong, without being &s;o directly con&s;cious of it."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, a man who goes to bed to his patron's wife is pretty &s;ure that he is committing wickedne&s;s."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Did the nonjuring clergy|men do &s;o, Sir?</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid many of them did."</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;tartled at his argument, and could by no means think it convincing. Had not his own father complied with the requi&s;ition of government, (as to which he once ob&s;erved to me, when I pre&s;&s;ed him upon it, <Q REND="inline"><HI>"That,</HI> Sir, he was to &s;ettle with him&s;elf,"</Q>) he would probably have thought more unfavour|ably of a Jacobite who took the oaths:
<Q><L>"&mdash;had he not re&s;embled</L>
<L>"My father as he <HI>&s;wore</HI>&mdash;"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="495" MS="y">
 Mr. Strahan talked of launching into the great ocean of London, in order to have a chance for ri&s;ing to eminence, and ob&s;erving that many men were kept back from trying their fortune there, becau&s;e they were born to a com|petency, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Small certainties are the bane of men of talents:"</Q> which John&s;on confirmed. Mr. Strahan put John&s;on in mind of a remark which he had made to him&punc; <Q REND="inline">"There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The more one thinks of this, (&s;aid Strahan,) the ju&s;ter it will appear."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice, upon John&s;on's recommendation. John&s;on having inquired after him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Strahan, let me have five guineas on account, and I'll give this boy one. Nay, if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it is &s;ad work. Call him down."</Q></P>
<P>I followed him into the court-yard, behind Mr. Strahan's hou&s;e; and there I had a proof of what I had heard him profe&s;s, that he talked alike to all. <Q REND="inline">"Some people (&s;aid he,) tell you that they let them&s;elves down to the capacity of their hearers. I never do that. I &s;peak uniformly, in as intelli|gible a manner as I can."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my boy, how do you go on?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pretty well, Sir; but they are afraid I an't &s;trong enough for &s;ome parts of the bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why I &s;hall be &s;orry for it; for when you con&s;ider with how little mental power and corporeal labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very de&s;irable occu|pation for you. Do you hear,&mdash;take all the pains you can; and if this does not do, we mu&s;t think of &s;ome other way of life for you. There's a guinea."</Q></P>
<P>Here was one of the many, many in&s;tances of his active benevolence. At the &s;ame time, the &s;low and &s;onorous &s;olemnity with which, while he bent him&s;elf down, he addre&s;&s;ed a little thick &s;hort-legged boy, contra&s;ted with the boy's aukwardne&s;s and awe, could not but excite &s;ome ludicrous emotions.</P>
<P>I met him at Drury-lane playhou&s;e in the evening. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, at Mrs. Abington's reque&s;t, had promi&s;ed to bring a body of wits to her benefit; and having &s;ecured forty places in the front boxes, had done me the honour to put me in the groupe. John&s;on &s;at on the &s;eat directly behind me; and as he could neither &s;ee nor hear at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the &s;tage, he was wrapped up in grave ab&s;traction, and &s;eemed quite a cloud, amid&s;t all the &s;un&s;hine of glitter and gaiety. I wondered at his patience in &s;itting out a play of five acts, and a farce of two. He &s;aid very little; but after the pro|logue to <Q REND="inline">"Bon Ton"</Q> had been &s;poken, which he could hear pretty well from the more &s;low and di&s;tinct utterance, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"Dryden has written
<PB N="465" REF="496" MS="y">
prologues &s;uperiour to any that David Garrick has written; but David Garrick has written more good prologues than Dryden has done. It is wonderful that he has been able to write &s;uch a variety of them."</Q></P>
<P>At Mr. Beauclerk's, where I &s;upped, was Mr. Garrick, whom I made happy with John&s;on's prai&s;e of his prologues; and I &s;uppo&s;e, in gratitude to him, he took up one of his favourite topicks, the nationality of the Scotch, which he maintained in his plea&s;ant manner, with the aid of a little poetical fiction. <Q REND="inline">"Come, come, don't deny it: they are really national. Why, now, the Adams are as liberal-minded men as any in the world: but, I don't know how it is, all their workmen are Scotch. You are, to be &s;ure, wonder|fully free from that nationality; but &s;o it happens, that you employ the only Scotch &s;hoe-black in London."</Q> He imitated the manner of his old ma&s;ter with ludicrous exaggeration; repeating, with pau&s;es and half whi&s;tlings interjected,
<Q><L>"Os homini &s;ublime dedit,&mdash;caelumque tueri&mdash;</L>
<L>"Ju&s;&s;it,&mdash;et erectos ad &s;idera&mdash;tollere vultus."</L></Q>
looking downwards all the time, and, while pronouncing the four la&s;t words, ab&s;olutely touching the ground with a kind of contorted ge&s;ticulation.</P>
<P>Garrick, however, when he plea&s;ed, could imitate John&s;on very exactly; for that great actor, with his di&s;tingui&s;hed powers of expre&s;&s;ion which were &s;o univer&s;ally admired, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o an admirable talent of mimickry. He was always jealous that John&s;on &s;poke lightly of him. I recollect his exhibiting him to me one day, as if &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"Davy is futile,"</Q> which he uttered perfectly with the tone and air of John&s;on.</P>
<P>I cannot too frequently reque&s;t of my readers while they peru&s;e my account of John&s;on's conver&s;ation, to endeavour to keep in mind his deliberate and &s;trong utterance. His mode of &s;peaking was indeed very impre&s;&s;ive <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">My noble friend Lord Pembroke &s;aid once to me at Wilton, with a happy plea&s;antry and &s;ome truth, that <Q REND="inline">"Dr. John&s;on's &s;ayings would not appear &s;o extraordinary, were it not for his <HI>bow|wow way."</HI></Q> The &s;ayings them&s;elves are generally of &s;terling merit; but, doubtle&s;s, his <HI>manner</HI> was an addition to their effect, and therefore &s;hould be attended to as much as may be. It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to guard tho&s;e who were not acquainted with him, again&s;t overcharged imita|tions or caricatures of his manner, which are frequently attempted, and many of which are &s;econd|hand copies from the late Mr. Hender&s;on the actor, who, though a good mimick of &s;ome per&s;ons, did not repre&s;ent John&s;on correctly.</NOTE>; and I wi&s;h it could be pre&s;erved as mu&s;ick is written, according to the very

 ingenious method of Mr. Steele <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">See <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Pro&s;odia Rationalis;</HI> or, an E&s;&s;ay towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the Melody and Mea&s;ure of Speech, to be expre&s;&s;ed and perpetuated by peculiar Symbols."</Q> London, 1779.</NOTE>, who has &s;hewn how the recitation of Mr. Garrick, and other eminent &s;peakers, might be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity <HI>in &s;core.</HI></P>
<P>Next day I dined with John&s;on at Mr. Thrale's. He attacked Gray, call|ing him <Q REND="inline">"a dull fellow."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand he was re&s;erved, and might appear dull in company; but &s;urely he was not dull in poetry."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he was dull in company, dull in his clo&s;et, dull every where. He was dull in a new way, and that made many people think him GREAT. He was a mechanical poet."</Q> He then repeated &s;ome ludicrous lines, which have e&s;caped my memory, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Is not that GREAT, like his Odes?"</Q> Mrs. Thrale maintained that his Odes were melodious; upon which he exclaimed,
<Q><L>"Weave the warp, and weave the woof;"&mdash;</L></Q>
I added, in a &s;olemn tone,
<Q><L>"The winding-&s;heet of Edward's race.'</L></Q>
<Q REND="inline"><HI>There</HI> is a good line."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Aye, (&s;aid he,) and the next line is a good one;"</Q> (pronouncing it contemptuou&s;ly):
<Q><L>"Give ample verge and room enough,"&mdash;</L></Q>
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, there are but two good &s;tanzas in Gray's poetry, which are in his 'Elegy in a Country Church-yard."</Q> He then repeated the &s;tanza,
<Q><L>"For who to dumb forgetfulne&s;s a prey," &amp;c.</L></Q>
mi&s;taking one word; for in&s;tead of <HI>precincts</HI> he &s;aid <HI>confines.</HI> He added, <Q REND="inline">"The other &s;tanza I forget."</Q></P>
<P>A young lady who had married a man much her inferiour in rank being mentioned, a que&s;tion aro&s;e how a woman's relations &s;hould behave to her in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and, while I recapitulate the debate, and recollect what has &s;ince happened, I cannot but be &s;truck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to expre&s;s. While I contended that &s;he ought to be treated with an inflexible &s;teadine&s;s of di&s;plea&s;ure, Mrs. Thrale was all for mildne&s;s and forgivene&s;s, and,
<PB N="467" REF="498">
according to the vulgar phra&s;e, making the be&s;t of a bad bargain. JOHNSON.  <Q REND="inline">"Madam, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h. Were I a man of rank, I would not let a daughter &s;tarve who had made a mean marriage; but having voluntarily degraded her&s;elf from the &s;tation which &s;he was originally entitled to hold, I would &s;upport her only in that which &s;he her&s;elf has cho&s;en; and would not put her on a level with my other daughters. You are to con&s;ider, Madam, that it is our duty to maintain the &s;ubordination of civili&s;ed &s;ociety; and when there is a gro&s;s and &s;hameful deviation from rank, it &s;hould be puni&s;hed &s;o as to deter others from the &s;ame perver&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>After frequently con&s;idering this &s;ubject, I am more and more confirmed in what I then meant to expre&s;s, and which was &s;anctioned by the autho|rity, and illu&s;trated by the wi&s;dom, of John&s;on; and I think it of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the happine&s;s of Society, to which &s;ubordination is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. It is weak, and contemptible, and unworthy, in a parent to relax in &s;uch a ca&s;e. It is &s;acrificing general advantage to private feelings. And let it be con&s;idered, that the claim of a daughter who has acted thus, to be re&s;tored to her former &s;ituation, is either fanta&s;tical or unju&s;t. If there be no value in the di&s;tinction of rank, what does &s;he &s;uffer by being kept in the &s;ituation to which &s;he has de&s;cended? If there be a value in that di&s;tinction, it ought to be &s;teadily maintained. If indulgence be &s;hewn to &s;uch conduct, and the offenders know that in a longer or &s;horter time they &s;hall be received as well as if they had not contaminated their blood by a ba&s;e alliance, the great check upon that inordinate caprice which generally occa&s;ions low mar|riages, will be removed, and the fair and comfortable order of improved life will be mi&s;erably di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Lord Che&s;terfield's letters being mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It was not to be wondered at that they had &s;o great a &s;ale, con&s;idering that they were the letters of a &s;tate&s;man, a wit, one who had been &s;o much in the mouths of mankind, one long accu&s;tomed <HI>vir&ucirc;m volitare per ora."</HI></Q></P>
<P>On Friday, March 31, I &s;upped with him and &s;ome friends at a tavern. One of the company attempted, with too much forwardne&s;s, to rally him on his late appearance at the theatre; but had rea&s;on to repent of his temerity. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, did you go to Mrs. Abington's benefit? Did you &s;ee?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Did you hear?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why then, Sir, did you go?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e, Sir, &s;he is a favourite of the publick: and when the publick cares the thou&s;andth part for you that it does for her, I will go to your benefit too."</Q></P>

 Next morning I won a &s;mall bett from Lady Diana Beauclerk, by a&s;king him as to one of his particularities, which her Lady&s;hip laid I dur&s;t not do. It &s;eems he had been frequently ob&s;erved at the club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had &s;queezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for him&s;elf. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and &s;eemed to think that he had a &s;trange unwillingne&s;s to be di&s;covered.

<P>He revi&s;ed &s;ome &s;heets of Lord Hailes's <Q REND="inline">"Annals of Scotland,"</Q> and wrote a few notes on the margin with red ink, which he bade me tell his Lord&s;hip did not &s;ink into the paper, and might be wiped off with a wet &s;ponge, &s;o that he did not &s;poil his manu&s;cript. I told him there were very few of his friends &s;o accurate as that I could venture to put down in writing what they told me as his &s;ayings.

<P>I vi&s;ited him by appointment in the evening, and we drank tea with Mrs. Williams. He told me that he had been in the company of a gentleman who&s;e extraordinary travels had been much the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. But I found that he had not li&s;tened to him with that full confidence, without which there is little &s;atisfaction in the &s;ociety of travellers. I was curious to hear what opinion &s;o able a judge as John&s;on had formed of his abilities, and I a&s;ked if he was not a man of &s;en&s;e.

<P>Next day, Sunday, April 2, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole's. We talked of Pope. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He wrote his 'Dunciad' for fame. That was his primary motive. Had it not been for that, the dunces might have railed again&s;t him till they were weary, without his troubling him&s;elf about them. He delighted to vex them, no doubt; but he had more delight in &s;eeing how well he could vex them."</Q></P>
<P>The <Q REND="inline">"Odes to Ob&s;curity and Oblivion,"</Q> in ridicule of <Q REND="inline">"cool Ma&s;on and warm Gray,"</Q> being mentioned, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"They are Colman's be&s;t things."</Q> Upon its being ob&s;erved that it was believed the&s;e Odes were made by Colman and Lloyd jointly;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, how can two people make an Ode? Perhaps one made one of them, and one the other."</Q> I ob&s;erved that two people had made a play, and quoted the anecdote of Beau|mont and Fletcher, who were brought under &s;ufpicion of trea&s;on, becau&s;e while concerting the plan of a tragedy when &s;itting together at a tavern, one of them was overheard &s;aying to the other, <Q REND="inline">'I'll kill the King.'</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t of the&s;e Odes is the be&s;t: but they are both good.

<P>I often wondered at his low e&s;timation of the writings of Gray and Ma&s;on. Of Gray's poetry I have, in a former part of this work, expre&s;&s;ed my high opinion; and for that of Mr. Ma&s;on I have ever entertained a warm admi|ration. His <Q REND="inline">"Elfrida"</Q> is exqui&s;ite, both in poetical de&s;cription and moral &s;entiment; and his <Q REND="inline">"Caractacus"</Q> is a noble drama. Nor can I omit paying my tribute of prai&s;e to &s;ome of his &s;maller poems which I have read with plea&s;ure, and which no critici&s;m &s;hall per&s;uade me not to like. If I won|dered at John&s;on's not ta&s;ting the works of Ma&s;on and Gray, &s;till more have I wondered at their not ta&s;ting his works; that they &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ible to his energy of diction, to his &s;plendour of images, and comprehen&s;ion of thought. Ta&s;tes may differ as to the violin, the flute, the hautboy, in &s;hort, all the le&s;&s;er in&s;truments: but who can be in&s;en&s;ible to the powerful impre&s;&s;ions of the maje&s;tick organ?</P>
<P>His <Q REND="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny"</Q> being mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think I have not been attacked enough for it. Attack is the re-action. I never think I
<PB N="472" REF="503" MS="y">
 have hit hard, unle&s;s it rebounds."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"I don't know, Sir, what you would be at. Five or &s;ix &s;hots of &s;mall arms in every new&s;paper, and repeated cannonading in pamphlets, might, I think &s;atisfy you. But, Sir, you'll never make out this match, of which we have talked, with a certain political lady, &s;ince you are &s;o &s;evere again&s;t her principles."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir, I have the better chance for that. She is like the Amazons of old; &s;he mu&s;t be courted by the &s;word. But I have not been &s;evere upon her."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, you have made her ridiculous."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That was already done, Sir. To endeavour to make <HI>her</HI> ridiculous, is like blacking the chimney."</Q></P>
<P>I put him in mind that the landlord at Ellon in Scotland &s;aid, that he heard he was the greate&s;t man in England,&mdash;next to Lord Mansfield. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, Sir, (&s;aid he,) the exception defined the idea. A Scotchman could go no farther:
<Q><L>"The force of Nature could no farther go."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Lady Miller's collection of ver&s;es by fa&s;hionable people, which were put into her Va&s;e at Bathca&s;ton villa, near Bath. in competition for honorary prizes, being mentioned, he held them very cheap: <Q REND="inline"><HI>"Bouts rim&eacute;s</HI> (&s;aid he,) is a mere conceit, and an <HI>old</HI> conceit <HI>now;</HI> I wonder how people were per|&s;uaded to write in that manner for this lady."</Q> I named a gentleman of his acquaintance, who wrote for the Va&s;e. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"He was a blockhead for his pains."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The Duche&s;s of Northumberland wrote."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the Duche&s;s of Northumberland may do what &s;he plea&s;es: nobody will &s;ay any thing to a lady of her high rank. But I &s;hould be apt to throw ******'s ver&s;es in his face."</Q></P>
<P>I talked of the cheerfulne&s;s of Fleet-&s;treet, owing to the con&s;tant quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of people which we perceive pa&s;&s;ing through it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, Fleet-&s;treet has a very animated appearance; but I think the full tide of human exi&s;tence is at Charing-cro&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>He made the common remark on the unhappine&s;s which men who have led a bu&s;y life experience, when they retire in expectation of enjoying them|&s;elves at ea&s;e, and that they generally langui&s;h for want of their habitual occupation, and wi&s;h to return to it. He mentioned as &s;trong an in&s;tance of this as can well be imagined. <Q REND="inline">"An eminent tallow-chandler in London, who had acquired a con&s;iderable fortune, gave up the trade in favour of his foreman, and went to live at a country-hou&s;e near town. He &s;oon grew weary, and paid frequent vi&s;its to his old &s;hop, where he de&s;ired they might let him know
<PB N="473" REF="504" MS="y">
their <HI>melting-days,</HI> and he would come and a&s;&s;i&s;t them; which he accordingly did. Here, Sir, was a man, to whom the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting circum&s;tance in the bu&s;ine&s;s to which he had been u&s;ed, was a relief from idlene&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, April 5, I dined with him at Me&s;&s;ieurs Dillys, with Mr. John Scott of Amwell, the Quaker, Mr. Langton, Mr. Miller, (now Sir John,) and Dr. Thomas Campbell, an Iri&s;h clergyman, whom I took the liberty of inviting to Me&s;&s;ieurs Dillys' table, having &s;een him at Mr. Thrale's, and been told that he had come to England chiefly with a view to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on, for whom he entertained the highe&s;t veneration. He has &s;ince publi&s;hed <Q REND="inline">"A philo&s;ophical Survey of the South of Ireland,"</Q> a very entertaining book, which has, however, one fault;&mdash;that it a&s;&s;umes the fictitious character of an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>We talked of publick &s;peaking.&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t not e&s;timate a man's powers by his being able or not able to deliver his &s;entiments in publick. I&s;aac Hawkins Browne, one of the fir&s;t wits of this country, got into parliament, and never opened his mouth. For my own part, I think it is more di&s;graceful never to try to &s;peak, than to try it and fail&punc; as it is more di&s;graceful not to fight, than to fight and be beaten."</Q> This argument appeared to me fallacious; for if a man has not &s;poken, it may be &s;aid that he would have done very well if he had tried; whereas, if he has tried and failed, there is nothing to be &s;aid for him. <Q REND="inline">"Why then, (I a&s;ked,) is it thought di&s;graceful for a man not to fight, and not di&s;graceful not to &s;peak in publick?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e there may be other rea&s;ons for a man's not &s;peaking in publick than want of re&s;olution: he may have nothing to &s;ay, (laughing). Whereas, Sir, you know courage is reckoned the greate&s;t of all virtues; becau&s;e, unle&s;s a man has that virtue, he has no &s;ecurity for pre&s;erving any other."</Q></P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline">"the &s;tatutes again&s;t bribery were intended to prevent up&s;tarts with money from getting into parliament;"</Q> adding, that <Q REND="inline">"if he were a gentleman of landed property, he would turn out all his tenants who did not vote for the candidate whom he &s;upported."</Q> LANGTON. <Q REND="inline">"Would not that, Sir, be checking the freedom of election?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the law does not mean that the privilege of voting &s;hould be independent of old family intere&s;t, of the permanent property of the country."</Q></P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, April 6, I dined with him at Mr. Thomas Davies's, with Mr. Hicky the painter, and my old acquaintance Mr. Moody the player.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, as u&s;ual, &s;poke contemptuou&s;ly of Colley Cibber. <Q REND="inline">"It is won|derful that a man, who for forty years had lived with the great and the witty. &s;hould have acquired &s;o ill the talents of conver&s;ation: and he had but half to
<PB N="474" REF="505" MS="y">
 furni&s;h; for one half of what he &s;aid was oaths."</Q> He, however, allowed con&s;iderable merit to &s;ome of his comedies, and &s;aid there was no rea&s;on to believe that <Q REND="inline">"The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band"</Q> was not written by him&s;elf. Davies &s;aid, he was the fir&s;t dramatick writer who introduced genteel ladies upon the &s;tage. John&s;on refuted this ob&s;ervation by in&s;tancing &s;everal &s;uch characters in comedies before his time. DAVIES. (trying to defend him&s;elf from a charge of ignorance,) <Q REND="inline">"I mean genteel moral characters."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I think (&s;aid Hicky,) gentility and morality are in&s;eparable."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"By no means, Sir. The genteele&s;t characters are often the mo&s;t immoral. Does not Lord Che&s;terfield give precepts for uniting wickedne&s;s and the graces? A man, indeed, is not genteel when he gets drunk; but mo&s;t vices may be committed very genteely: a man may debauch his friend's wife genteely: he may cheat at cards genteely."</Q> HICKY. <Q REND="inline">"I do not think <HI>that</HI> is genteel."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, it may not be like a gentleman, but it may be genteel."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"You are meaning two different things. One means exteriour grace; the other honour. It is certain, that a man may be very immoral with exteriour grace. Lovelace, in 'Clari&s;&s;a,' is a very genteel and a very wicked character. Tom Hervey, who died t'other day, though a vicious man, was one of the genteele&s;t men that ever lived."</Q> Tom Davies in&s;tanced Charles the Second. JOHNSON, (taking fire at any attack upon this Prince, for whom he had an extraordinary partiality,) <Q REND="inline">"Charles the Second was licentious in his practice; but he always had a reverence for what was good. Charles the Second knew his people, and rewarded merit. The Church was at no time better filled than in his reign. He was the be&s;t King we have had from his time till the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, except James the Second, who was a very good King, but unhappily believed that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of his &s;ubjects that they &s;hould be Roman Catholicks. <HI>He</HI> had the merit of endeavouring to do what he thought was for the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of his &s;ubjects, till he lo&s;t a great empire. <HI>We,</HI> who thought that we &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be &s;aved if we were Roman Catholicks, had the merit of maintaining our religion, at the expence of &s;ubmitting our&s;elves to the government of King William, (for it could not be done otherwi&s;e,)&mdash;to the government of one of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s &s;coundrels that ever exi&s;ted. No; Charles the Second was not &s;uch a man as&mdash;, (naming another King). He did not de&s;troy his father's will. He took money, indeed, from France: but he did not betray tho&s;e over whom he ruled: he did not let the French fleet pa&s;s ours. George the Fir&s;t knew nothing, and de&s;ired to know nothing; did nothing, and de&s;ired to do nothing: and the only good thing that is told of him is, that he wi&s;hed to re&s;tore the crown to its hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;or."</Q> He roared with prodigious
<PB N="475" REF="506" MS="y">
violence again&s;t George the Second. When he cea&s;ed, Moody interjected, in an Iri&s;h tone, and with a comick look, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! poor George the Second."</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned that Dr. Thomas Campbell had come from Ireland to London, principally to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on. He &s;eemed angry at this ob&s;ervation. DAVIES. <Q REND="inline">"Why, you know, Sir, there came a man from Spain to &s;ee Livy <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Plin. Epi&s;t. Lib. ii. Fp. 3.</NOTE>; and Corelli came to England to &s;ee Purcell, and, when he heard he was dead, went directly back again to Italy."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not have wi&s;hed to be dead to di&s;appoint Campbell, had he been &s;o fooli&s;h as you repre&s;ent him; but I &s;hould have wi&s;hed to have been a hundred miles off."</Q> This was apparently perver&s;e; and I do believe it was not his real way of thinking: he could not but like a man who came &s;o far to &s;ee him. He laughed with &s;ome complacency, when I told him Campbell's odd expre&s;&s;ion to me con|cerning him: <Q REND="inline">"That having &s;een &s;uch a man, was a thing to talk of a century hence;"</Q>&mdash;as if he could live &s;o long.</P>
<P>We got into an argument whether the Judges who went to India might with propriety engage in trade. John&s;on warmly maintained that they might. <Q REND="inline">"For why (he urged) &s;hould not Judges get riches, as well as tho&s;e who de&s;erve them le&s;s."</Q> I &s;aid, they &s;hould have &s;ufficient &s;alaries, and have nothing to take off their attention from the affairs of the publick. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"No Judge, Sir, can give his whole attention to his office; and it is very proper that he &s;hould employ what time he has to him&s;elf, for his own advantage, in the mo&s;t profitable manner."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, (&s;aid Davies, who enlivened the di&s;pute by making it &s;omewhat dramatick,) he may become an in&s;urer; and when he is going to the bench, he may be &s;topped,&mdash;'Your Lord&s;hip cannot go yet: here is a bunch of invoices: &s;everal &s;hips are about to &s;ail."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you may as well &s;ay a judge &s;hould not have a hou&s;e; for they may come and tell him, 'Your Lord&s;hip's hou&s;e is on fire;' and &s;o, in&s;tead of minding the bu&s;ine&s;s of his Court, he is to be occupied in getting the engine with the greate&s;t &s;peed. There is no end of this. Every Judge who has land, trades to a certain extent in corn or in cattle; and in the land it&s;elf, undoubtedly. His &s;teward acts for him, and &s;o do clerks for a great merchant. A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs. A Judge may play a little at cards for his amu&s;ement; but he is not to play at marbles, or at chuck-farthing in the Piazza. No, Sir; there is no profe&s;&s;ion to which a man gives a very great proportion of his time. It is wonderful when a calcu|lation is made, how little the mind is actually employed in the di&s;charge of
<PB N="476" REF="507">
 any profe&s;&s;ion. No man would be a Judge, upon the condition of being obliged to be totally a Judge. The be&s;t employed lawyer has his mind at work but for a &s;mall proportion of his time: a great deal of his occupation is merely mechanical.&mdash;I once wrote for a magazine: I made a calculation, that if I &s;hould write but a page a day, at the &s;ame rate, I &s;hould, in ten years, write nine volumes in folio, of an ordinary &s;ize and print."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Such as Carte's Hi&s;tory?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir. When a man writes from his own mind, he writes very rapidly <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Johns;on certainly did, who had a mind &s;tored with knowledge, and teeming with imagery: but the ob&s;ervation is not applicable to writers in general.</NOTE>. The greate&s;t part of a writer's time is &s;pent in reading, in order to write&punc; a man will turn over half a library to make one book."</Q></P>
<P>I argued warmly again&s;t the Judges trading, and mentioned Hale as an in&s;tance of a perfect Judge, who devoted him&s;elf entirely to his office. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Hale, Sir, attended to other things be&s;ide law: he left a great e&s;tate."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"That was, becau&s;e what he got, accumulated without any exertion and anxiety on his part."</Q></P>
<P>While the di&s;pute went on, Moody once tried to &s;ay &s;omething upon our &s;ide. Tom Davies clapped him on the back, to encourage him. Beauclerk, to whom I mentioned this circum&s;tance, &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"he could not conceive a more humiliating &s;ituation than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;poke of Rolt, to who&s;e Dictionary of Commerce, Dr. John&s;on wrote the Preface. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Old Gardner the book&s;eller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly mi&s;cellany, called 'The Vi&s;itor.' There was a formal written contract, which Allen the printer &s;aw. Gardner thought as you do of the Judge. They were bound to write nothing el&s;e. They were to have, I think, a third of the profits of this &s;ixpenny pamphlet; and the contract was for ninety-nine years. I wi&s;h I had thought of giving this to Thurlow, in the cau&s;e about Literary Property. What an excellent in&s;tance would it have been of the oppre&s;&s;ion of book&s;ellers towards poor authours!"</Q> (&s;miling). Davies, zealous for the honour of <HI>the Trade,</HI> &s;aid, Gardner was not properly a book|&s;eller. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, Sir&punc; he certainly was a book&s;eller. He had &s;erved his time regularly, was a member of the Stationers' company, kept a &s;hop in the face of mankind, purcha&s;ed copy-right, and was a <HI>bibliopole,</HI> Sir, in every &s;en&s;e. I wrote for &s;ome months in 'The Vi&s;itor,' for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him good. I hoped his wits would &s;oon return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'The Vi&s;itor' no longer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="508" MS="y">
Friday, April 7, I dined with him at a tavern, with a numerous company.  JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I have been reading 'Twi&s;s's Travels in Spain,' which are ju&s;t come out. They are as good as the fir&s;t book of travels that you will take up&punc; They are as good as tho&s;e of Key&s;ler or Blainville; nay, as Addi&s;on's, if you except the learning. They are not &s;o good as Brydone's, but they are better than Pococke's. I have not, indeed, cut the leaves yet; but I have read in them where the pages are open, and I do not &s;uppo&s;e that what is in the pages which are clo&s;ed is wor&s;e than what is in the open pages.&mdash;It would &s;eem (he added,) that Addi&s;on had not acquired much Italian learning, for we do not find it introduced into his writings. The only in&s;tance that I recollect, is his quoting <HI>'Stavo bene. Per &s;tar meglio, &s;to qui."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I mentioned Addi&s;on's having borrowed many of his cla&s;&s;ical remarks from Leandro Alberti. Mr. Beauclerk &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It was alledged that he had borrowed al&s;o from another Italian authour."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, all who go to look for what the Cla&s;&s;icks have &s;aid of Italy mu&s;t find the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages; and I &s;hould think it would be one of the fir&s;t things the Italians would do on the revival of learning, to collect all that the Roman authours had &s;aid of their country."</Q></P>
<P>O&s;&s;ian being mentioned;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Suppo&s;ing the Iri&s;h and Er&s;e lan|guages to be the &s;ame, which I do not believe, yet as there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the inhabitants of the Highlands and Hebrides ever wrote their native language, it is not to be credited that a long poem was pre&s;erved among them. If we had no evidence of the art of writing being practi&s;ed in one of the counties of England, we &s;hould not believe that a long poem was pre&s;erved <HI>there,</HI> though in the neighbouring counties, where the &s;ame language was &s;poken, the inhabitants could write."</Q> BEAUCLERK. <Q REND="inline">"The ballad of Lulla|balero was once in the mouths of all the people of this country, and is &s;aid to have had a great effect in bringing about the Revolution. Yet I que&s;tion whether any body can repeat it now; which &s;hews how improbable it is that much poetry &s;hould be pre&s;erved by tradition."</Q></P>
<P>One of the company &s;ugge&s;ted an internal objection to the antiquity of the poetry &s;aid to be O&s;&s;ian's, that we do not find the wolf in it, which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e had it been of that age.</P>
<P>The mention of the wolf had led John&s;on to think of other wild bea&s;ts; and while Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds and Mr. Langton were carrying on a dialogue about &s;omething which engaged them earne&s;tly, he, in the mid&s;t of it, broke out, <Q REND="inline">"Pennant tells of Bears&mdash;"</Q> [what he added, I have forgotten.] They went on, which he being dull of hearing, did not perceive, or, if he did, was
<PB N="478" REF="509" MS="y">
 not willing to break off his talk; &s;o he continued to vociferate his remarks, and <HI>Bear</HI> (<Q REND="inline">"like a word in a catch,"</Q> as Beauclerk &s;aid,) was repeatedly heard at intervals, which coming from him who, by tho&s;e who did not know him, had been &s;o often a&s;&s;imilated to that ferocious animal, while we who were &s;itting around could hardly &s;tifle laughter, produced a very ludicrous effect. Silence having en&s;ued, he proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"We are told, that the black bear is innocent; but I &s;hould not like to tru&s;t my&s;elf with him."</Q> Mr. Gibbon mut|tered, in a low tone of voice, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not like to tru&s;t my&s;elf with <HI>you."</HI></Q> This piece of &s;arca&s;tick plea&s;antry was a prudent re&s;olution, if applied to a competition of abilities.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m having become one of our topicks, John&s;on &s;uddenly uttered, in a &s;trong determined tone, an apothegm, at which many will &s;tart: <Q REND="inline">"Patrioti&s;m is the la&s;t refuge of a &s;coundrel."</Q> But let it be con&s;idered, that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patrioti&s;m which &s;o many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for &s;elf-intere&s;t. I&punc; maintained, that certainly all patriots were not &s;coundrels. Being urged (not by John&s;on,) to name one exception, I mentioned an eminent per&s;on, whom we all greatly admired. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I do not &s;ay that he is <HI>not</HI> hone&s;t; but we have no rea&s;on to conclude from his political conduct that he <HI>is</HI> hone&s;t. Were he to accept of a place from this mini&s;try, he would lo&s;e that character of firmne&s;s which he has, and might be turned out of his place in a year. This mini&s;try is neither &s;table, nor grateful to their friends, as Sir Robert Walpole was: &s;o that he may think it more for his intere&s;t to take his chance of his party coming in."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Pritchard being mentioned, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Her playing was quite mecha|nical. It is wonderful how little mind &s;he had. Sir, &s;he had never read the tragedy of Macbeth all through. She no more thought of the play out of which her part was taken, than a &s;hoemaker thinks of the &s;kin, out of which the piece of leather, of which he is making a pair of &s;hoes, is cut.</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, where we met the Iri&s;h Dr. Campbell. John&s;on had &s;upped the night before at Mrs. Abington's, with &s;ome fa&s;hionable people whom he named; and he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with having made one in &s;o elegant a circle.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale, who frequently practi&s;ed a coar&s;e mode of flattery, by repeating his <HI>bon mots</HI> in his hearing, told us that he had &s;aid, a certain celebrated actor was ju&s;t fit to &s;tand at the door of an auction-room, with a long pole, and cry, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, gentlemen, walk in;"</Q> and that a certain authour, upon hearing this, had &s;aid, that another &s;till more celebrated actor was fit for nothing better than
<PB N="479" REF="510">
that, and would pick your pocket after you came out. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Nay, my dear lady, there is no wit in what our friend added; there is only abu&s;e. You may as well &s;ay of any man that he will pick a pocket. Be&s;ides, the man who is &s;tationed at the door does not pick people's pockets: that is done within, by the auctioneer."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale told us, that Tom Davies repeated, in a very bald manner, the &s;tory of Dr. John&s;on's fir&s;t repartee to me, which I have related exactly <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Page 211.</NOTE>. He made me &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>was born</HI> in Scotland,"</Q> in&s;tead of <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>come from</HI> Scot|land;"</Q> &s;o that John&s;on's &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"That, Sir, is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help,"</Q> had no point, or even meaning: and that upon this being mentioned to Mr. Fitzherbert, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"It is not every man that can <HI>carry</HI> a <HI>bon mot."</HI></Q></P>
<P>On Monday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, with Mr. Langton and the Iri&s;h Dr. Campbell, whom the General had obligingly given me leave to bring with me. This learned gentleman was thus gratified with a very high intellectual fea&s;t, by not only being in company with Dr. John&s;on, but with General Oglethorpe, who had been &s;o long a celebrated name both at home and abroad <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Let me here be allowed to pay my tribute of mo&s;t &s;incere gratitude to the memory of that excellent per&s;on, my intimacy with whom was the more valuable to me, becau&s;e my fir&s;t acquaint|ance with him was unexpected and un&s;olicited. Soon after the publication of my <Q REND="inline">"Account of Cor&s;ica,"</Q> he did me the honour to call on me, and approaching me with a frank courteous air, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My name, Sir, is Oglethorpe, and I wi&s;h to be acquainted with you."</Q> I was not a little &s;lattered to be thus addre&s;&s;ed by an eminent man, of whom I had read in Pope, from my early years,

On Friday, April 14, being Good-Friday, I repaired to him in the morn|ing, according to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom on this day, and breakfa&s;ted with him.

Lord Bute, though a very honourable man,&mdash;a man who meant well,&mdash;a man who had his blood full of prerogative,&mdash;was a theoretical &s;tate&s;man,&mdash;a book-mini&s;ter,&mdash;and thought this country could be governed by the influence of the Crown alone. Then, Sir, he gave up a great deal. He advi&s;ed the King to agree that the Judges &s;hould hold their places for life, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing them at the acce&s;&s;ion of a new King. Lord Bute, I &s;uppo&s;e, thought to make the King popular by this conce&s;&s;ion; but the people never minded it; and it was a mo&s;t impolitick mea&s;ure. There is no rea&s;on why a Judge &s;hould hold his office for life, more than any other per&s;on in publick tru&s;t. A Judge may be partial otherwi&s;e than to the Crown: we have &s;een Judges partial to the populace. A Judge may become corrupt, and yet there may not be legal evidence again&s;t him. A Judge may become froward from age. A Judge may grow unfit for his office in many ways. It was de&s;irable that there &s;hould be a po&s;&s;ibility of being delivered from him by a new King. That is now gone by an act of parlia|ment <HI>ex grati&acirc;</HI> of the Crown. Lord Bute advi&s;ed the King to give up a very large &s;um of money <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The money ari&s;ing from the property of the prizes taken before the declaration of war, which were given to his Maje&s;ty by the peace of Paris, and amounted to upwards of 700,000l. and from the lands in the ceded i&s;lands, which were e&s;timated at 200,000l. more. Surely, there was a noble munificence in this gift from a Monarch to his people. And let it be remembered, that during the Earl of Bute's admini&s;tration, the King was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give up the hereditary revenues of the Crown, and to accept, in&s;tead of them, of the limited &s;um of 800,000l. a year; upon which Black&s;tone ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">"The hereditary revenues, being put under the &s;ame manage|ment as the other branches of the publick patrimony, will produce more, and be better collected than heretofore; and the publick is a gainer of upwards of 100,000l. <HI>per annum,</HI> by this di&s;|intere&s;ted bounty of his Maje&s;ty."</Q> <BIBL>Book I.

 I &s;ay Lord Bute advi&s;ed, I mean, that &s;uch acts were done when he was mini&s;ter, and we are to &s;uppo&s;e that he advi&s;ed them.&mdash;Lord Bute &s;hewed an undue partiality to Scotchmen. He turned out Dr. Nichols, a very eminent man, from being phy&s;ician to the King, to make room for one of his countrymen, a man very low in his profe&s;&s;ion.

<P>I told him, that the admi&s;&s;ion of one of them before the fir&s;t people in England, which had given the greate&s;t offence, was no more than what hap|pens at every mini&s;ter's levee, where tho&s;e who attend are admitted in the order that they have come, which is better than admitting them according to their rank; for if that were to be the rule, a man who has waited all the morning might have the mortification to &s;ee a peer, newly come, go in before him, and keep him waiting &s;till.

As we walked to St. Clement's church, and &s;aw &s;everal &s;hops open upon this mo&s;t &s;olemn fa&s;t-day of the Chri&s;tian world, I remarked, that one di&s;|advantage ari&s;ing from the immen&s;ity of London, was, that nobody was heeded by his neighbour; there was no fear of cen&s;ure for not ob&s;erving Good-Friday, as it ought to be kept, and as it is kept in country towns.

<P>Dr. Wetherell, Ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity College, Oxford, accompanied us home from church; and after he was gone, there came two other gentlemen, one of whom uttered the common-place complaints, that by the increa&s;e of taxes, labour would be dear, other nations would under&s;ell us, and our commerce would be ruined.

Whether the &s;ubject was his own &s;ituation, or the &s;tate of the pub|lick, or the &s;tate of human nature in general, though he &s;aw the evils, his mind was turned to re&s;olution, and never to whining or complaint.</P>
<P>We went again to St. Clement's in the afternoon. He had found fault with the preacher in the morning for not choo&s;ing a text adapted to the day. The preacher in the afternoon had cho&s;en one extremely proper: <Q REND="inline">"It is fini&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>After the evening &s;ervice, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Come, you &s;hall go home with me, and &s;it ju&s;t an hour."</Q> But he was better than his word; for after we had drunk tea with Mrs. Williams, he a&s;ked me to go up to his &s;tudy with him, where we &s;at a long while together in a &s;erene undi&s;turbed frame of mind&punc; &s;ometimes in &s;ilence, and &s;ometimes conver&s;ing, as we felt our&s;elves inclined, or more properly &s;peaking, as <HI>he</HI> was inclined; for during all the cour&s;e of my long intimacy with him, my re&s;pectful attention never abated, and my wi&s;h to hear him was &s;uch, that I con&s;tantly watched every dawning of commu|nication from that great and illuminated mind.</P>

<P>I told him that our friend Gold&s;mith had &s;aid to me, that he had come too late into the world, for that Pope and other poets had taken up the places in the Temple of Fame; &s;o that as but a few at any period can po&s;&s;e&s;s poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire it. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"That is one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible things I have ever heard of Gold&s;mith. It is difficult to get literary fame, and it is every day growing more difficult. Ah, Sir, that &s;hould make a man think of &s;ecuring happine&s;s in another world, which all who try &s;incerely for it may attain. In compari&s;on of that, how little are all other things! The belief of immortality is impre&s;&s;ed upon all men, and all men act under an impre&s;&s;ion of it, however they may talk, and though, per|haps, they may be &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of it."</Q> I &s;aid, it appeared to me that &s;ome people had not the lea&s;t notion of immortality; and I mentioned a di&s;tingui&s;hed gentleman of our acquaintance.

This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries."</Q> Sir Jo&s;hua ob&s;erved to me, the extraordinary prompti|tude with which John&s;on flew upon an argument. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, (&s;aid I,) he has no formal preparation, no flouri&s;hing with his &s;word; he is through your body in an in&s;tant."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on was here &s;olaced with an elegant entertainment, a very accom|pli&s;hed family, and much good company; among whom was Mr. Harris of Sali&s;bury, who paid him many compliments on his <Q REND="inline">"Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands."</Q></P>
<P>The common remark as to the utility of reading hi&s;tory being made;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t con&s;ider how very little hi&s;tory there is; I mean real authentick hi&s;tory. That certain Kings reigned, and certain battles were fought, we can depend upon as true; but all the colouring, all the philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="488" REF="519" MS="y">
 of hi&s;tory is conjecture."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"Then, Sir, you would reduce all hi&s;tory to no better than an almanack, a mere chronological &s;eries of remark|able events."</Q> Mr. Gibbon, who mu&s;t at that time have been employed upon his hi&s;tory, of which he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t volume in the following year, was pre&s;ent, but did not &s;tep forth in defence of that &s;pecies of writing. He pro|bably did not like to <HI>tru&s;t</HI> him&s;elf with John&s;on <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See page 478.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John&s;on ob&s;erved, that the force of our early habits was &s;o great, that though rea&s;on approved, nay, though our &s;en&s;es reli&s;hed a different cour&s;e, almo&s;t every man returned to them. I do not believe there is any ob&s;ervation upon human nature better founded than this; and, in many ca&s;es, it is a very painful truth; for where early habits have been mean and wretched, the joy and eleva|tion re&s;ulting from better modes of life, mu&s;t be damped by the gloomy con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being under an almo&s;t inevitable doom to &s;ink back into a &s;ituation which we recollect with di&s;gu&s;t. It &s;urely may be prevented, by con|&s;tant attention and unremitting exertion to e&s;tabli&s;h contrary habits of &s;uperiour efficacy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera,"</Q> and the common que&s;tion, whether it was pernicious in its effects, having been introduced;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"As to this matter, which has been very much conte&s;ted, I my&s;elf am of opinion, that more influence has been a&s;cribed to 'The Beggars Opera,' than it in reality ever had; for I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being pre&s;ent at its repre&s;entation. At the &s;ame time I do not deny that it may have &s;ome influence, by making the character of a rogue familiar, and in &s;ome degree plea&s;ing <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">A very eminent phy&s;ician, who&s;e di&s;cernment is as acute and penetrating in judging of the human character as it is in his own profe&s;&s;ion, remarked once at a club where I was, that a lively young man, fond of plea&s;ure and without money, would hardly re&s;i&s;t a &s;olicitation from his mi&s;tre&s;s to go upon the highway, immediately after being pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation of <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera."</Q> I have been told of an ingenious ob&s;ervation by Mr. Gibbon, that <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera may, perhaps, have &s;ometimes increa&s;ed the number of highwaymen; but that it has had a beneficial effect in refining that cla&s;s of men, making them le&s;s ferocious, more polite, in &s;hort, more like gentlemen."</Q> Upon this Mr. Courtenay &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"Gay was the Orpheus of highwaymen."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Then collecting him&s;elf, as it were, to give a heavy &s;troke: <Q REND="inline">"There is in it &s;uch a <HI>labefactation</HI> of all principles, as may be injurious to morality."</Q></P>
<P>While he pronounced this re&s;pon&s;e, we &s;at in a comical &s;ort of re&s;traint, &s;mothering a laugh, which we were afraid might bur&s;t out. In his Life of Gay, he has been &s;till more deci&s;ive as to the inefficiency of <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera,"</Q> in corrupting &s;ociety. But I have ever thought &s;omewhat differently;
<PB N="489" REF="520" MS="y">
for, indeed, not only are the gaiety and heroi&s;m of a highwayman very captivating to a youthful imagination, but the arguments for adventurous depredation are &s;o plau&s;ible, the allu&s;ions &s;o lively, and the contra&s;ts with the ordinary and more painful modes of acquiring property are &s;o artfully di&s;played, that it requires a cool and &s;trong judgement to re&s;i&s;t &s;o impo&s;ing an aggregate: yet, I own, I &s;hould be very &s;orry to have <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera"</Q> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for there is in it &s;o much of real London life, &s;o much brilliant wit, and &s;uch a variety of airs, which, from early a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, engage, &s;oothe, and enliven the mind, that no performance which the theatre exhibits, delights me more.</P>
<P>The late <Q REND="inline"><HI>"worthy"</HI></Q> Duke of Queen&s;berry, as Thom&s;on, in his <Q REND="inline">"Sea&s;ons,"</Q> ju&s;tly characteri&s;es him, told me, that when Gay fir&s;t &s;hewed him <Q REND="inline">"The Beggars Opera,"</Q> his Grace's ob&s;ervation was, <Q REND="inline">"This is a very odd thing, Gay; I am &s;atisfied that it is either a very good thing, or a very bad thing."</Q> It proved the former, beyond the warme&s;t expectations of the authour or his friends. Mr. Cambridge, however, &s;hewed us to day, that there was good rea&s;on enough to doubt concerning its &s;ucce&s;s. He was told by Quin, that during the fir&s;t night of its appearance it was long in a very dubious &s;tate; that there was a di&s;po&s;ition to damn it, and that it was &s;aved by the &s;ong, <Q REND="inline">"Oh ponder well, be not &s;evere."</Q> Quin him&s;elf had &s;o bad an opinion of it, that he refu&s;ed the part of Captain Macheath, and gave it to Walker, who acquired great celebrity by his grave yet animated performance of it.</P>
<P>We talked of a young gentleman's marriage with an eminent &s;inger, and his determination that &s;he &s;hould no longer &s;ing in publick, though his father was very earne&s;t &s;he &s;hould, becau&s;e her talents would be liberally rewarded &s;o as to make her a good fortune. It was que&s;tioned whether the young gentleman, who had not a &s;hilling in the world, but was ble&s;t with very uncommon talents, was not fooli&s;hly delicate, or fooli&s;hly proud, and his father truly rational without being mean. John&s;on, with all the high &s;pirit of a Roman &s;enator, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"He re&s;olved wi&s;ely and nobly to be &s;ure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be di&s;graced by having his wife &s;inging publickly for hire? No, Sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I &s;hould not <HI>prepare</HI> my&s;elf for a publick &s;inger, as readily as let my wife be one."</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on arraigned the modern politicks of this country, as entirely devoid of all principle of whatever kind. <Q REND="inline">"Politicks (&s;aid he) are now nothing more than means of ri&s;ing in the world. With this &s;ole view do men engage in politicks, and their whole conduct proceeds upon it. How different in that re&s;pect is the &s;tate of the nation now from what it was in
<PB N="490" REF="521" MS="y">
 the time of Charles the Fir&s;t, during the U&s;urpation, and after the Re&s;tora|tion, in the time of Charles the Second. Hudibras affords a &s;trong proof how much hold political principles had then upon the minds of men. There is in Hudibras a great deal of bullion, which will always la&s;t. But to be &s;ure the brighte&s;t &s;trokes of his wit owed their force to the impre&s;&s;ion of the characters, which was upon men's minds at the time; to their knowing them, at table and in the &s;treet; in &s;hort, being familiar with them; and above all, to his &s;atire being directed again&s;t tho&s;e whom a little while before they had hated and feared. The nation in general has ever been loyal, has been at all times attached to the monarch, though a few daring rebels have been wonderfully powerful for a time. The murder of Charles the Fir&s;t was undoubtedly not committed with&punc; the approbation or con&s;ent of the people. Had that been the ca&s;e, parliament would not have ventured to con&s;ign the regicides to their de&s;erved puni&s;hment. And we know what exuberance of joy there was when Charles the Second was re&s;tored. If Charles the Second had bent all his mind to it, had made it his &s;ole object, he might have been as ab&s;olute as Louis the Fourteenth."</Q> A gentleman ob&s;erved he would have done no harm if he had. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, ab&s;olute princes &s;eldom do any harm. But they who are governed by them are governed by chance. There is no &s;ecurity for good government."</Q> CAMBRIDGE. <Q REND="inline">"There have been many &s;ad victims to ab&s;olute power."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"So, Sir, have there been to popular factions."</Q> BOSWELL. <Q REND="inline">"The que&s;tion is, which is wor&s;t, one wild bea&s;t or many?"</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on prai&s;ed <Q REND="inline">"The SPECTATOR,"</Q> particularly the character of Sir Roger de Coverley. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir Roger did not die a violent death, as has been generally fancied. He was not killed; he died only becau&s;e others were to die, and becau&s;e his death afforded an opportunity to Addi&s;on for &s;ome very fine writing. We have the example of Cervantes m&agrave;king Don Quixote die.&mdash;I never could &s;ee why Sir Roger is repre&s;ented as a little cracked. It appears to me that the &s;tory of the widow was intended to have &s;omething &s;uperinduced upon it: but the &s;uper&s;tructure did not come."</Q></P>
<P>Somebody found fault with writing ver&s;es in a dead language, maintaining that they were merely arrangements of &s;o many words, and laughed at the Univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge, for &s;ending forth collections of them not only in Greek and Latin, but even in Syriack, Arabick, and other more unknown tongues. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I would have as many of the&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; I would have ver&s;es in every language that there are the means of acquiring.

I would have the world to be thus told, 'Here is a &s;chool where every thing may be learnt."</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;et out next day on a vi&s;it to the Earl of Pembroke, at Wilton, and to my friend, Mr. Temple, at Mamhead, in Devon&s;hire, and not having returned to town till the &s;econd of May, I did not &s;ee Dr. John&s;on for a con&s;iderable time, and during the remaining part of my &s;tay in London, kept very imperfect notes of his conver&s;ation, which had I according to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom written out at large &s;oon after the time, much might have been pre&s;erved, which is now irretrievably lo&s;t. I can now only record &s;ome particular &s;cenes, and a few fragments of his <HI>memorabilia.</HI> But to make &s;ome amends for my relaxation of diligence in one re&s;pect, I have to pre&s;ent my readers with arguments upon two law ca&s;es, with which he favoured me.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the &s;ixth of May, we dined by our&s;elves at the Mitre, and he dictated to me what follows, to obviate the complaint already mentioned <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Page 443.</NOTE>, which had been made in the form of an action in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, by Dr. Memis, of Aberdeen, that in the &s;ame tran&s;lation of a charter in which <HI>phy&s;icians</HI> were mentioned, he was called <HI>Doctor of Medicine.</HI></P>
<Q><P>THERE are but two rea&s;ons for which a phy&s;ician can decline the title of <HI>Doctor of Medicine,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf di&s;graced by the doctor&s;hip, or &s;uppo&s;es the doctor&s;hip di&s;graced by him&s;elf. To be di&s;graced by a title which he &s;hares in common with every illu&s;trious name of his profe&s;&s;ion, with Boerhaave, with Arbuthnot, and with Cullen, can &s;urely dimini&s;h no man's reputation. It is, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the doctorate, from which he &s;hrinks, that he owes his right of practi&s;ing phy&s;ick. A Doctor of Medicine is a phy&s;ician under the protection of the laws, and by the &s;tamp of authority. The phy&s;ician who is not a Doctor, u&s;urps a profe&s;&s;ion, and is authori&s;ed only by him&s;elf to decide upon health and &s;ickne&s;s, and life and death. That this gentleman is a Doctor, his diploma makes evident; a diploma not obtruded upon him, but obtained by &s;olicitation, and for which fees were paid. With what countenance any man can refu&s;e the title which he has either begged or bought, is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P>All verbal injury mu&s;t compri&s;e in it either &s;ome fal&s;e po&s;ition, or &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary declaration of defamatory truth. That in calling him Doctor, a fal&s;e appellation was given him, he him&s;elf will not pretend, who at the &s;ame time that he complains of the title, would be offended if we &s;uppo&s;ed him to
<PB N="492" REF="523">
 be not a Doctor. If the title of Doctor be a defamatory truth, it is time to di&s;&s;olve our colleges, for why &s;hould the publick give &s;alaries to men who&s;e approbation is reproach? It may likewi&s;e de&s;erve the notice of the publick to con&s;ider what help can be given to the profe&s;&s;ors of phy&s;ick, who all &s;hare with this unhappy gentleman the ignominious appellation, and of whom the very boys in the &s;treet are not afraid to &s;ay, <HI>There goes the Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>What is implied by the term Doctor is well known. It di&s;tingui&s;hes him to whom it is granted, as a man who has attained &s;uch knowledge of his profe&s;&s;ion as qualifies him to in&s;truct others. A Doctor of Laws is a man who can form lawyers by his precepts. A Doctor of Medicine is a man who can teach the art of curing di&s;ea&s;es. There is an old axiom which no man has yet thought fit to deny, <HI>Nil dat quod non habet.</HI> Upon this principle to be a Doctor implies &s;kill, for <HI>nemo docet quod non didicit.</HI> In England, whoever practi&s;es phy&s;ick, not being a Doctor, mu&s;t practice by a licence: but the doctorate conveys a licence in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>By what accident it happened that he and the other phy&s;icians were mentioned in different terms, where the terms them&s;elves were equivalent, or where in effect that which was applied to him was the more honourable, perhaps they who wrote the paper cannot now remember. Had they expected a law&s;uit to have been the con&s;equence of &s;uch petty variation, I hope they would have avoided it <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;tice to Dr. Memis, though I was again&s;t him as an Advocate, I mu&s;t mention, that he objected to the variation very earne&s;tly, before the tran&s;lation was printed off.</NOTE>. But, probably, as they meant no ill, they &s;u&s;pected no danger, and, therefore, con&s;ulted only what appeared to them propriety or convenience.</P></Q>
<P>A few days afterwards I con&s;ulted him upon a cau&s;e, <HI>Pater&s;on and others</HI> again&s;t <HI>Alexander and others,</HI> which had been decided by a ca&s;ting vote in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, determining that the Corporation of Stirling was corrupt, and &s;etting a&s;ide the election of &s;ome of their officers, becau&s;e it was proved that three of the leading men who influenced the majority, had entered into an unju&s;tifiable compact, of which, however, the majority were ignorant. He dictated to me, after a little con&s;ideration, the following &s;entences upon the &s;ubject:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THERE is a difference between majority and &s;uperiority; majority is applied to number, and &s;uperiority to power; and power like many other things, is to be e&s;timated <HI>non numero &s;ed pondere.</HI> Now though the greater <HI>number</HI> is not corrupt, the greater <HI>weight</HI> is corrupt, &s;o that corruption
<PB N="493" REF="524">
predominates in the borough, taken <HI>collectively,</HI> though, perhaps, taken  <HI>numerically,</HI> the greater part may be uncorrupt. That borough which is &s;o con&s;tituted as to act corruptly, is in the eye of rea&s;on corrupt, whether it be by the uncontroulable power of a few, or by an accidental pravity of the multitude. The objection, in which is urged the inju&s;tice of making the innocent &s;uffer with the guilty, is an objection not only again&s;t &s;ociety, but again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ociety. All &s;ocieties, great and &s;mall, &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon this condition; that as the individuals derive advantages from union, they may likewi&s;e &s;uffer inconveniences; that as tho&s;e who do nothing and &s;ometimes tho&s;e who do ill, will have the honours and emoluments of general virtue and general pro&s;perity, &s;o tho&s;e likewi&s;e who do nothing or perhaps do well, mu&s;t be involved in the con&s;equences of predominant corruption."</Q></P>
<P>This in my opinion was a very nice ca&s;e; but the deci&s;ion was affirmed in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>On Monday, May 8, we went together and vi&s;ited the man&s;ions of Bedlam. I had been informed that he had once been there before with Mr. Wedderburne, (now Lord Loughborough,) Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Foote; and I had heard Foote give a very entertaining account of John&s;on's happening to have his attention arre&s;ted by a man who was very furious, and who, while beating his &s;traw, &s;uppo&s;ed it to be William Duke of Cumberland, whom he was puni&s;h|ing for his cruelties in Scotland in 1746. There was nothing peculiarly remarkable this day; but the general contemplation of in&s;anity was very affect|ing. I accompanied him home, and dined and drank tea with him.</P>
<P>Talking of an acquaintance of ours, di&s;tingui&s;hed for knowing an uncommon variety of mi&s;cellaneous articles both in antiquities and polite literature, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"You know, Sir, he runs about with little weight upon his mind."</Q> And talking of another very ingenious gentleman, who from the warmth of his temper was at variance with many of his acquaintance, and wi&s;hed to avoid them, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, he leads the life of an outlaw."</Q></P>
<P>On Friday, May 12, as he had been &s;o good as to a&s;&s;ign me a room in his hou&s;e, where I might &s;leep occa&s;ionally, when I happened to &s;it with him to a late hour, I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it this night, &s;ound every thing in excellent order, and was attended by hone&s;t Francis with a mo&s;t civil a&s;&s;iduity. I a&s;ked him whether I might go to a con&s;ultation with another lawyer upon Sunday, as that appeared to me to be doing work as much in my way, as if an arti&s;an &s;hould work on the day appropriated for religious re&s;t. JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, when you are of con&s;equence enough to oppo&s;e the practice of con&s;ulting upon Sunday, you &s;hould do it: but you may go
<PB N="494" REF="525">
 now. It is not criminal, though it is not what one &s;hould do, who is anxious for the pre&s;ervation and increa&s;e of piety, to which a peculiar ob&s;ervance of Sunday is a great help. The di&s;tinction is clear between what is of moral and what is of ritual obligation."</Q></P>
<P>On Saturday, May 13, I breakfa&s;ted with him by invitation, accompanied by Mr. Andrew Cro&s;bie, a Scotch Advocate, whom he had &s;een at Edinburgh, and the Hon. Colonel (now General) Edward Stopford, brother to Lord Courtown, who was de&s;irous of being introduced to him. His tea and rolls and butter, and whole breakfa&s;t apparatus were all in &s;uch decorum, and his behaviour was &s;o courteous, that Colonel Stopford was quite &s;urprized, and wondered at his having heard &s;o much &s;aid of John&s;on's &s;lovenline&s;s and rough|ne&s;s. I have pre&s;erved nothing of what pa&s;&s;ed, except that Cro&s;bie plea&s;ed him much by talking learnedly of alchymy, as to which John&s;on was not a po&s;itive unbeliever, but rather delighted in con&s;idering what progre&s;s had actually been made in the tran&s;mutation of metals, what near approaches there had been to the making of gold; and told us that it was affirmed, that a per&s;on in the Ru&s;&s;ian dominions had di&s;covered the &s;ecret, but died without revealing it, as imagining it would be prejudicial to &s;ociety. He added, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible but it might in time be generally known.</P>
<P>It being a&s;ked whether it was rea&s;onable for a man to be angry at another whom a woman had preferred to him;&mdash;JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"I do not &s;ee, Sir, that it is rea&s;onable for a man to be angry at another, whom a woman has preferred to him: but angry he is, no doubt; and he is loath to be angry at him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Before &s;etting out for Scotland on the 23d, I was frequently in his company at different places, but during this period have recorded only two remarks: one concerning Garrick: <Q REND="inline">"He has not Latin enough. He finds out the Latin by the meaning, rather than the meaning by the Latin."</Q> And another concerning writers of travels, who, he ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline">"were more defective than any other writers."</Q></P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed many hours with him on the 17th, of which I find all my memo|rial is, <Q REND="inline">"much laughing."</Q> It would &s;eem he had that day been in a humour for jocularity and merriment, and upon &s;uch occa&s;ions I never knew a man laugh more heartily. We may &s;uppo&s;e, that the high reli&s;h of a &s;tate &s;o dif|ferent from his habitual gloom, produced more than ordinary exertions of that di&s;tingui&s;hing faculty of man, which has puzzled philo&s;ophers &s;o much to explain. John&s;on's laugh was as remarkable as any circum&s;tance in his man|ner. It was a kind of good humoured growl. Tom Davies de&s;cribed it drolly enough: <Q REND="inline">"He laughs like a rhinoceros."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now returned from the annual ramble into the middle counties. Having &s;een nothing that I had not &s;een before, I have nothing to relate. Time has left that part of the i&s;land few antiquities; and commerce has left the people no &s;ingularities. I was glad to go abroad, and, perhaps, glad to come home; which is, in other words, I was, I am afraid, weary of being at home, and weary of being abroad. Is not this the &s;tate of life? But, if we confe&s;s this wearine&s;s, let us not lament it; for all the wi&s;e and all the good &s;ay, that we may cure it.</P>
<P>For the black fumes which ri&s;e in your mind, I can pre&s;cribe nothing but that you di&s;per&s;e them by hone&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s or innocent plea&s;ure, and by reading &s;ometimes ea&s;y and &s;ometimes &s;erious. Change of place is u&s;eful; and I hope that your re&s;idence at Auchinleck will have many good effects. * * * * * *.</P>
<P>That I &s;hould have given pain to Ra&s;ay, I am &s;incerely &s;orry; and am therefore very much plea&s;ed that he is no longer unea&s;y. He &s;till thinks that I have repre&s;ented him as per&s;onally giving up the Chieftain&s;hip. I meant only that it was no longe rconte&s;ted between the two hou&s;es, and &s;uppo&s;ed it
<PB N="497" REF="528" MS="y">
&s;ettled, perhaps, by the ce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome remote generation, in the hou&s;e of  Dunvegan. I am &s;orry the adverti&s;ement was not continued for three or four times in the papers.</P>
<P>That Lord Monboddo and Mr. Macqueen &s;hould controvert a po&s;ition contrary to the imaginary intere&s;t of literary or national prejudice, might be ea&s;ily imagined; but of a &s;tanding fact there ought to be no controver&s;y: If there are men with tails, catch an <HI>homo caudatus;</HI> if there was writing of old in the Highlands or Hebrides, in the Er&s;e language, produce the manu&s;cripts. Where men write, they will write to one another, and &s;ome of their letters, in families &s;tudious of their ance&s;try, will be kept. In Wales there are many manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>I have now three parcels of Lord Hailes's hi&s;tory, which I purpo&s;e to return all the next week: that his re&s;pect for my little ob&s;ervations &s;hould keep his work in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, makes one of the evils of my journey. It is in our language, I think, a new mode of hi&s;tory, which tells all that is wanted, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, all that is known, without laboured &s;plendour of language, or affected &s;ubtilty of conjecture. The exactne&s;s of his dates rai&s;es my wonder. He &s;eems to have the clo&s;ene&s;s of Henault without his con&s;traint.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thrale was &s;o entertained with your 'Journal',' that &s;he almo&s;t read her&s;elf blind. She has a great regard for you.</P>
<P>Of Mrs. Bo&s;well, though &s;he knows in her heart that &s;he does not love me, I am always glad to hear any good, and hope that &s;he and the little dear ladies will have neither &s;ickne&s;s nor any other affliction. But &s;he knows that &s;he does not care what becomes of me, and for that &s;he may be &s;ure that I think her very much to blame.</P>
<P>Never, my dear Sir, do you take it into your head to think that I do not love you; you may &s;ettle your&s;elf in full confidence both of my love and my e&s;teem; I love you as a kind man, I value you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety.

<P>It is to be regretted, that he did not write an account of his travels in France; for as he is reported to have once &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"he could write the Life of a Broom&s;tick,"</Q> &s;o, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many former travellers have exhau&s;ted almo&s;t every thing &s;ubject for remark in that great kingdom, his very accurate ob&s;ervation, and peculiar vigour of thought and illu&s;tration, would have pro|duced a valuable work. During his vi&s;it to it, which la&s;ted but about two months, he wrote notes or minutes of what he &s;aw. He promi&s;ed to &s;hew me them, but I neglected to put him in mind of it; and the greate&s;t part of them have been lo&s;t, or, perhaps, de&s;troyed in that precipitate burning of his papers a few days before his death, which mu&s;t ever be lamented: One &s;mall paper-book, however, entitled <Q REND="inline">"FRANCE, II."</Q> has been pre&s;erved, and is in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is a diurnal regi&s;ter of his life and ob&s;ervations, from the 10th of October to the 4th of November, inclu&s;ive, being twenty-&s;ix days; and &s;hews an extraordinary attention to various minute particulars. Being the only memorial of this tour that remains, my readers, I am confident, will peru&s;e it with plea&s;ure, though his notes are very &s;hort, and evidently written only to a&s;&s;i&s;t his own recollection.</P>

<P>We vi&s;ited the Ob&s;ervatory, a large building of a great height. The upper &s;tones of the parapet very large; but not cramped with iron. The flat on the top is very exten&s;ive; but on the in&s;ulated part there is no parapet. Though it was broad enough, I did not care to go upon it. Maps were print|ing in one of the rooms.</P>

<P>Trianon is a kind of retreat appendant to Ver&s;ailles.

<P>Oct. 23. Monday. La&s;t night I wrote to Levet.&mdash;We went to &s;ee the looking-gla&s;&s;es wrought. They come from Normandy in ca&s;t plates, perhaps the third of an inch thick. At Paris they are ground upon a marble table, by rubbing one plate on another with grit between them. The various &s;ands, of which there are &s;aid to be five, I could not learn. The handle, by which the upper gla&s;s is moved, has the form of a wheel, which may be moved in all directions. The plates are &s;ent up with their &s;urfaces ground, but not poli&s;hed, and &s;o continue till they are be&s;poken, le&s;t time &s;hould &s;poil the &s;urface, as we were told. Tho&s;e that are to be poli&s;hed, are laid on a table covered with &s;everal thick cloths, hard &s;trained, that the re&s;i&s;tance may be equal; they are then rubbed with a hand rubber, held down hard by a contrivance which I did not well under&s;tand. The powder which is u&s;ed la&s;t &s;eemed to me to be iron di&s;&s;olved in aqua fortis: they called it, as Baretti &s;aid, <HI>marc de l'eau forte,</HI> which he thought was dregs. They mentioned vitriol and &s;altpetre. The cannon ball &s;wam in the quick|&s;ilver. To &s;ilver them, a leaf of beaten tin is laid, and rubbed with quick|&s;ilver, to which it unites. Then more quick&s;ilver is poured upon it, which, by its mutual [attraction] ri&s;es very high. Then a paper is laid at the neare&s;t end of the plate, over which the gla&s;s is &s;lided till it lies upon the plate, having driven much of the quick&s;ilver before it. It is then, I think, pre&s;&s;ed upon cloths, and then &s;et &s;loping to drop the &s;uperfluous mercury; the &s;lope is daily heigthened towards a perpendicular.</P>
<P>In the way I &s;aw the Gr&ecirc;ve, the mayor's hou&s;e, and the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>We then went to Sans-terre, a brewer. He brews with about as much malt as Mr. Thrale, and &s;ells his beer at the &s;ame price, though he pays no duty for malt, and little more than half as much for beer. Beer is &s;old retail at 6d. a bottle. He brews 4,000 barrels a year. There are &s;eventeen brewers in Paris, of whom none is &s;uppo&s;ed to brew more than he:&mdash;reckoning them at 3,000 each, they make 51,000 a year.&mdash;They make their malt, for malting is here no trade.</P>

<P>It happened that Foote was at Paris at the &s;ame time with Dr. John&s;on, and his de&s;cription of my friend while there was abundantly ludicrous. He told me, that the French were quite a&s;toni&s;hed at his figure and manner, and at his dre&s;s, which he ob&s;tinately continued exactly as in London;&mdash;his brown clothes, black &s;tockings, and plain &s;hirt. He mentioned, that an Iri&s;h gentleman &s;aid to John&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you have not &s;een the be&s;t French players."</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Players, Sir! I look on them as no better than creatures &s;et upon tables and joint-&s;tools to make faces and produce laughter, like dancing dogs."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, you will allow that &s;ome players are better than others?"</Q> JOHNSON. <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, as &s;ome dogs dance better than others."</Q></P>
<P>While John&s;on was in France, he was generally very re&s;olute in &s;peaking Latin. It was a maxim with him that a man &s;hould not let him&s;elf down, by &s;peaking a language which he &s;peaks imperfectly. Indeed, we mu&s;t have often ob&s;erved how in&s;eriour, how much like a child a man appears, who &s;peaks a broken tongue. When Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, at one of the dinners of the Royal Academy, pre&s;ented him to a Frenchman of great di&s;tinction, he would not deign to &s;peak French, but talked Latin, though his Excellency did not under&s;tand it, owing, perhaps, to John&s;on's Engli&s;h pronunciation: yet upon another occa&s;ion he was ob&s;erved to &s;peak French to a Frenchman of high rank, who &s;poke Engli&s;h; and being a&s;ked the rea&s;on, with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urprize,&mdash;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I think my French is as good as his Engli&s;h."</Q> Though John&s;on under&s;tood French perfectly, he could not &s;peak it readily, as I have ob&s;erved at his fir&s;t interview with General Paoli, in 1769; yet he wrote it, I imagine, very well, as appears from &s;ome of his letters in Mrs. Piozzi's collection, of which I &s;hall tran&s;cribe one.</P>

<P>Here let me not forget a curious anecdote, as related to me by Mr. Beauclerk, which I &s;hall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman's lively manner; and in ju&s;tice to him it is proper to add, that Dr. John&s;on told me, I might rely both on the correctne&s;s of his memory, and the fidelity of his narrative. <Q REND="inline">"When Madame de Boufflers was fir&s;t in England, (&s;aid Beauclerk,) &s;he was de&s;irous to &s;ee John&s;on. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple, where &s;he was entertained with his conver&s;ation for &s;ome time. When our vi&s;it was over, &s;he and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a noi&s;e like thunder. This was occa&s;ioned by John&s;on, who it &s;eems upon a little recollection, had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary re&s;idence to a foreign lady of quality, and eager to &s;hew him&s;elf a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the &s;tair|ca&s;e in violent agitation. He overtook us before we reached the Temple|gate, and bru&s;hing in between me and Madame de Bouf&s;iers, &s;ei&s;ed her hand, and conducted her to her coach. His dre&s;s was a ru&s;ty brown morning &s;uit, a pair of old &s;hoes by way of &s;lippers, a little &s;hrivelled wig &s;ticking on the top of his he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and the &s;leeves of his &s;hirt and the knees of his breeches hanging loo&s;e. A con&s;iderable crowd of people gathered round, and were not a little &s;truck by this &s;ingular ap|pearance."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;poke Latin with wonderful fluency and elegance. When Pere Bo&s;covich was in England, John&s;on dined in company with him at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds's, and at Dr. Douglas's, now Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le.

<P>MR. ALEXANDER MACLEAN, the pre&s;ent young Laird of Col, being to &s;et out to-morrow for London, I give him this letter to introduce him to your acquaintance. The kindne&s;s which you and I experienced from his brother, who&s;e unfortunate death we &s;incerely lament, will make us always de&s;irous to &s;hew attention to any branch of the family. Indeed, you have &s;o much of the true Highland cordiality, that I am &s;ure you would have thought me to blame if I had neglected to recommend to you this Hebridean prince, in who&s;e i&s;land we were ho&s;pitably entertained. I ever am with re&s;pectful attachment,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Maclean returned with the mo&s;t agreeable accounts of the polite attention with which he was received by Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year Dr. Burney informs me, that <Q REND="inline">"he very frequently met Dr. John&s;on at Mr. Thrale's, at Streatham, where they had many long conver&s;ations, often &s;itting up as long as the fire and candles la&s;ted, and much longer than the patience of the &s;ervants &s;ub&s;i&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P>A few of John&s;on's &s;ayings, which that gentleman recollects, &s;hall here be in&s;erted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I never take a nap after dinner but when I have had a bad night, and then the nap takes me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The writer of an epitaph &s;hould not be con&s;idered as &s;aying nothing but what is &s;trictly true. Allowance mu&s;t be made for &s;ome degree of exag|gerated prai&s;e. In lapidary in&s;criptions a man is not upon oath."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There is now le&s;s flogging in our great &s;chools than formerly, but then le&s;s is learned there; &s;o that what the boys get at one end, they lo&s;e at the other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"More is learned in publick than in private &s;chools, from emulation; there is the colli&s;ion of mind with mind, or the radiation of many minds pointing to one center. Though few boys make their own exerci&s;es, yet if a good exerci&s;e is given up, out of a great number of boys, it is made by &s;omebody."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hate bye-roads in education. Education is as well known, and has long been as well known, as ever it can be. Endeavouring to make children
<PB N="515" REF="546" MS="y">
prematurely wi&s;e is u&s;ele&s;s labour. Suppo&s;e they have more knowledge at  five or &s;ix years old than other children, what u&s;e can be made of it? It will be lo&s;t before it is wanted, and the wa&s;te of &s;o much time and labour of the teacher can never be repaid. Too much is expected from precocity, and too little performed. Mi&s;s&mdash;was an in&s;tance of early cultivation&punc; but in what did it terminate? In marrying a little Pre&s;byterian par&s;on, who keeps an infant boarding-&s;chool, &s;o that all her employment now is, 'to &s;uckle fools and chronicle &s;mall beer.' She tells the children, 'This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; &s;ee there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can &s;peak.' If I had be&s;towed &s;uch an education on a daughter, and had di&s;covered that &s;he thought of marrying &s;uch a fellow, I would have &s;ent her to the <HI>Congre&s;s."</HI></Q></P>
<P>After having talked &s;lightingly of mu&s;ick, he was ob&s;erved to li&s;ten very attentively while Mi&s;s Thrale played on the harp&s;ichord, and with eagerne&s;s he called to her, <Q REND="inline">"Why don't you da&s;h away like Burney?"</Q> Dr. Burney upon this &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir, we &s;hall make a mu&s;ician of you at la&s;t."</Q> John&s;on with candid complacency replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I &s;hall be glad to have a new &s;en&s;e given to me."</Q></P>
<P>He had come down one morning to the breakfa&s;t-room, and been a con&s;iderable time by him&s;elf before any body appeared. When on a &s;ub&s;equent day, he was twitted by Mrs. Thrale for being very late, which he generally was, he defended him&s;elf by alluding to the extraordinary morning, when he had been too early, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I do not like to come down to <HI>vacuity."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Dr. Burney having remarked that Mr. Garrick was beginning to look old, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, you are not to wonder at that; no man's face has had more wear and tear."</Q></P>
<P>Not having heard from him for a longer time than I &s;uppo&s;ed he would be &s;ilent, I wrote to him December 18, not in good &s;pirits, <Q REND="inline">"Sometimes I have been afraid that the cold which has gone over Europe this year like a &s;ort of pe&s;tilence, has &s;ci&s;ed you &s;everely; &s;ometimes my imagination, which is upon occa&s;ions prolifick of evil, hath figured that you may have &s;omehow taken offence at &s;ome part of my conduct."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NEVER dream of any offence, how &s;hould you offend me? I con&s;ider your friend&s;hip as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which I intend to hold till you take it from me, and to lament if ever by my fault I &s;hould lo&s;e it.
<PB N="516" REF="547" MS="y">
 However, when &s;uch &s;u&s;picions find their way into your mind, always give them vent, I &s;hall make ha&s;te to di&s;per&s;e them, but hinder their fir&s;t ingre&s;s if you can. Con&s;ider &s;uch thoughts as morbid.</P>
<P>Such illne&s;s as may excu&s;e my omi&s;&s;ion to Lord Hailes I cannot hone&s;tly plead. I have been hindered I know not how, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of petty ob&s;tructions. I hope to mend immediately, and to &s;end next po&s;t to his Lord&s;hip. Mr. Thrale would have written to you if I had omitted; he &s;ends his compliments, and wi&s;hes to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>You and your lady will now have no more wrangling about feudal inheritance. How does the young Laird of Auchinleck? I &s;uppo&s;e Mi&s;s Veronica is grown a reader and di&s;cour&s;er.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now got a cough, but it has never yet hindered me from &s;leeping: I have had quieter nights than are common with me.</P>
<P>I cannot but rejoice that Jo&s;eph<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Rieter, a Bohemian, who was in my &s;ervice many years, and attended Dr. John&s;on and me in our Tour to the Hebrides.

<P>Young Col brought me your letter. He is a very plea&s;ing youth. I took him two days ago to the Mitre, and we dined together. I was as civil as I had the means of being.</P>
<P>I have had a letter from Ra&s;ay, acknowledging, with great appearance of &s;atisfaction, the in&s;ertion in the Edinburgh paper. I am very glad that it was done.</P>
<P>My compliments to Mrs. Bo&s;well, who does not love me; and of all the re&s;t, I need only &s;end them to tho&s;e that do; and I am afraid it will give you very little trouble to di&s;tribute them.</P>
