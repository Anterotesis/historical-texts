<P>WEALTH, as Mr. Hobbes &s;ays, is power. But the per&s;on who either acquires, or &s;ucceeds to a great fortune, does not nece&s;&s;a|rily acquire or &s;ucceed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fortune does nece&s;&s;arily convey to him either. The power which that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of purcha&s;ing; a certain com|mand over all the labour, or over all the produce of labour, which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or le&s;s, preci&s;ely in pro|portion to the extent of this power; or to the quantity either of other men's labour, or, what is the &s;ame thing, of the produce of other men's labour, which it enables him to purcha&s;e or command. The exchangeable value of every thing mu&s;t always be preci&s;ely equal to the extent of this power which it conveys to its owner.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that whatever may be the &s;up|po&s;ed annual importation of gold and &s;ilver, there mu&s;t be a certain period, at which the annual con&s;umption of tho&s;e metals will be equal to that annual importation. Their con&s;umption mu&s;t in|crea&s;e as their ma&s;s increa&s;es, or rather in a much greater propor|tion. As their ma&s;s increa&s;es, their value dimini&s;hes. They are more u&s;ed, and le&s;s cared for, and their con&s;umption con&s;equently increa&s;es in a greater proportion than their ma&s;s. After a certain period, therefore, the annual con&s;umption of tho&s;e metals mu&s;t, in this manner, become equal to their annual importation, provided that importation is not continually increa&s;ing; which, in the pre&s;ent times, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IF, when the annual con&s;umption has become equal to the annual importation, the annual importation &s;hould gradually dimini&s;h, the annual con&s;umption may, for &s;ome time, exceed the annual im|portation.

<P>THUS, in Great Britain, Sile&s;ia lawns may be imported for home con&s;umption upon paying certain duties. But French cambricks and lawns are prohibited to be imported, except into the port of London, there to be warehou&s;ed for exportation. Higher duties are impo&s;ed upon the wines of France than upon tho&s;e of Portugal, or indeed of any other country. By what is called the impo&s;t 1692, a duty of five and twenty per cent., of the rate or value, was laid upon all French goods; while the goods of other nations were, the greater part of them, &s;ubjected to much lighter duties, &s;eldom ex|ceeding five per cent. The wine, brandy, &s;alt and vinegar of France were indeed excepted; the&s;e commodities being &s;ubjected to other heavy duties, either by other laws, or by particular clau&s;es of the &s;ame law. In 1696, a &s;econd duty of twenty-five per cent., the fir&s;t not having been thought a &s;ufficient di&s;couragement, was impo&s;ed upon all French goods, except brandy; together with a new duty of five and twenty pounds upon the ton of French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of French vinegar. French goods have never been omitted in any of tho&s;e general &s;ub&s;idies, or duties of five per cent., which have been impo&s;ed upon all, or the greater part of the goods enumerated in the book of rates. If we count the one third and two third &s;ub&s;idies as making a complete &s;ub&s;idy between them, there have been five of the&s;e general &s;ub&s;idies; &s;o that before the commencement of the pre&s;ent war &s;eventy-five per cent. may be con|&s;idered as the lowe&s;t duty, to which the greater part of the goods of the growth, produce, or manufacture of France were liable. But upon the greater part of goods, tho&s;e duties are equivalent to a pro|hibition. The French in their turn have, I believe, treated our goods and manufactures ju&s;t as hardly; though I am not &s;o well acquainted with the particular hard&s;hips which they have impo&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="4">
upon them. Tho&s;e mutual re&s;traints have put an end to almo&s;t all fair commerce between the two nations, and &s;mugglers are now the principal importers, either of Briti&s;h goods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The principles which I have been ex|amining in the foregoing chapter took their origin from private in|tere&s;t and the &s;pirit of monopoly; tho&s;e which I am going to exa|mine in this, from national prejudice and animo&s;ity.</P>

<P>IT is in con&s;equence of the&s;e maxims that the commerce between France and England has in both countries been &s;ubjected to &s;o many di&s;couragements and re&s;traints. If tho&s;e two countries, however, were to con&s;ider their real intere&s;t, without either mercantile jea|lou&s;y or national animo&s;ity, the commerce of France might be more advantageous to Great Britain than that of any other country, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on that of Great Britain to France. France is the neare&s;t neighbour to Great Britain. In the trade between the &s;outh|ern coa&s;t of England and the northern and north-we&s;tern coa&s;ts of France, the returns might be expected, in the &s;ame manner as in the inland trade, four, five, or &s;ix times in the year. The capital, therefore, employed in this trade, could in each of the two coun|tries keep in motion four, five, or &s;ix times the quantity of indu&s;try, and afford employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to four, five, or &s;ix times the number of people, which an equal capital could do in the greater part of the other branches of foreign trade. Between the parts of France and Great Britain mo&s;t remote from one another, the returns might be expected, at lea&s;t, once in the year, and even this trade would &s;o far be at lea&s;t equally advantageous as the greater part of the other branches of our foreign European trade. It would be, at lea&s;t, three times more advantageous, than the boa&s;ted trade with our
<PB N="5" REF="5">
North American colonies, in which the returns were &s;eldom made in le&s;s than three years, frequently not in le&s;s than four or five years. France, be&s;ides, is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain twenty-four millions of in|habitants. Our North American colonies were never &s;uppo&s;ed to contain more than three millions: And France is a much richer country than North America; though, on account of the more un|equal di&s;tribution of riches, there is much more poverty and beg|gary in the one country, than in the other. France, therefore, could afford a market at lea&s;t eight times more exten&s;ive, and, on ac|count of the &s;uperior frequency of the returns, four and twenty times more advantageous, than that which our North American co|lonies ever afforded. The trade of Great Britain would be ju&s;t as advantageous to France, and, in proportion to the wealth, popula|tion and proximity of the re&s;pective countries, would have the &s;ame &s;uperiority over that which France carries on with her own colonies. Such is the very great difference between that trade which the wi&s;|dom of both nations has thought proper to di&s;courage, and that which it has favoured the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT the very &s;ame circum&s;tances which would have rendered an open and free commerce between the two countries &s;o advantageous to both, have occa&s;ioned the principal ob&s;tructions to that commerce. Being neighbours, they are nece&s;&s;arily enemies, and the wealth and power of each becomes, upon that account, more formidable to the other; and what would increa&s;e the advantage of national friend|&s;hip, &s;erves only to inflame the violence of national animo&s;ity. They are both rich and indu&s;trious nations; and the merchants and manu|facturers of each, dread the competition of the &s;kill and activity of tho&s;e of the other. Mercantile jealou&s;y is excited, and both inflames, and is it&s;elf inflamed, by the violence of national animo&s;ity: And the traders of both countries have announced, with all the pa&s;&s;ionate confidence of intere&s;ted fal&s;ehood, the certain ruin of each, in con|&s;equence of that unfavourable balance of trade, which, they pre|tend,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
would be the infallible effect of an unre&s;trained commerce with the other.</P>

<P>BY the &s;econd of the rules, annexed to the act of parliament, which impo&s;ed what is now called, the old &s;ub&s;idy, every merchant, whether Engli&s;h or alien, was allowed to draw back half that duty upon exportation; the Engli&s;h merchant, provided the exportation took place within twelve months; the alien, provided it took place with|in nine months. Wines, currants, and wrought &s;ilks were the only goods which did not fall within this rule, having other and more ad|vantageous allowances. The duties impo&s;ed by this act of parlia|ment were, at that time, the only duties upon the importation of foreign goods. The term within which this, and all other draw|backs, could be claimed, was afterwards (by 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. &s;ect. 10.) extended to three years.</P>
<P>THE duties which have been impo&s;ed &s;ince the old &s;ub&s;idy, are, the greater part of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general rule, however, is liable to a great number of excep|tions, and the doctrine of drawbacks has become a much le&s;s &s;imple matter, than it was at their fir&s;t in&s;titution.</P>
<P>UPON the exportation of &s;ome foreign goods, of which it was ex|pected that the importation would greatly exceed what was nece&s;|&s;ary for the home con&s;umption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining even half the old &s;ub&s;idy. Before the revolt of our North American colonies, we had the monopoly of the tobacco of Maryland and Virginia. We imported about ninety-&s;ix thou&s;and hog&s;heads, and the home con&s;umption was not &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed fourteen thou&s;and. To facilitate the great exportation which was
<PB N="7" REF="7">
nece&s;&s;ary, in order to rid us of the re&s;t, the whole duties were drawn back, provided the exportation took place within three years.</P>
<P>WE &s;till have, though not altogether, yet very nearly, the mono|poly of the &s;ugars of our We&s;t Indian I&s;lands. If &s;ugars are ex|ported within a year, therefore, all the duties upon importation are drawn back, and if exported within three years, all the duties, except half the old &s;ub&s;idy, which &s;till continues to be retained upon the exportation of the greater part of goods. Though the importation of &s;ugar exceeds, a good deal, what is nece&s;&s;ary for the home con|&s;umption, the exce&s;s is incon&s;iderable, in compari&s;on of what it u&s;ed to be in tobacco.</P>
<P>SOME goods, the particular objects of the jealou&s;y of our own manufacturers, are prohibited to be imported for home con&s;ump|tion. They may, however, upon paying certain duties, be import|ed and warehou&s;ed for exportation. But upon &s;uch exportation, no part of the&s;e duties are drawn back. Our manufacturers are unwilling, it &s;eems, that even this re&s;tricted importation &s;hould be encouraged, and are afraid le&s;t &s;ome part of the&s;e goods &s;hould be &s;tolen out of the warehou&s;e, and thus come into competition with their own. It is under the&s;e regulations only that we can import wrought &s;ilks, French cambricks and lawns, callicoes painted, printed, &s;tained, or dyed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choo&s;e rather to forego a profit to our&s;elves, than to &s;uffer tho&s;e, whom we con&s;ider as our enemies, to make any profit by our means. Not only half the old &s;ub&s;idy, but the &s;econd twenty-five per cent., is retained upon the exportation of all French goods.</P>
<P>BY the fourth of the rules annexed to the old &s;ub&s;idy, the draw|back allowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more than half the duties which were, at that time, paid upon their importation; and it &s;eems, at that time, to have been the ob|ject of the legi&s;lature to give &s;omewhat more than ordinary encou|ragement
<PB N="8" REF="8">
to the carrying trade in wine. Several of the other duties too, which were impo&s;ed, either at the &s;ame time, or &s;ub&s;equent to the old &s;ub&s;idy; what is called the additional duty, the new &s;ub|&s;idy, the one-third and two-thirds &s;ub&s;idies, the impo&s;t 1692, the coinage on wine, were allowed to be wholly drawn back upon ex|portation. All tho&s;e duties, however, except the additional duty and impo&s;t 1692, being paid down in ready money, upon import|ation, the intere&s;t of &s;o large a &s;um occa&s;ioned an expence, which made it unrea&s;onable to expect any profitable carrying trade in this article. Only a part, therefore, of the duty called the impo&s;t on wine, and no part of the twenty-five pounds the ton upon French wines, or of the duties impo&s;ed in 1745, in 1763, and in 1778, were allowed to be drawn back upon exportation. The two im|po&s;ts of five per cent., impo&s;ed in 1779 and 1781, upon all the former duties of cu&s;toms, being allowed to be wholly drawn back upon the exportation of all other goods, were likewi&s;e allowed to be drawn back upon that of wine. The la&s;t duty that has been par|ticularly impo&s;ed upon wine, that of 1780, is allowed to be wholly drawn back; an indulgence, which, when &s;o many heavy duties are retained, mo&s;t probably could never occa&s;ion the exportation of a &s;ingle ton of wine. The&s;e rules take place with regard to all places of lawful exportation, except the Briti&s;h colonies in America.</P>
<P>THE 15th Charles II. chap. 7. called an act for the encourage|ment of trade, had given Great Britain the monopoly of &s;upplying the colonies with all the commodities of the growth or manufacture of Europe; and con&s;equently with wines. In a country of &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a coa&s;t as our North American and We&s;t Indian colonies, where our authority was always &s;o very &s;lender, and where the in|habitants were allowed to carry out, in their own &s;hips, their non|enumerated commodities, at fir&s;t, to all parts of Europe, and after|wards to all parts of Europe &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre, it is not very probable that this monopoly could ever be much re&s;pected; and
<PB N="9" REF="9">
they probably, at all times, found means of bringing back &s;ome cargo from the countries to which they were allowed to carry out one. They &s;eem, however, to have found &s;ome difficulty in im|porting European wines from the places of their growth, and they could not well import them from Great Britain, where they were loaded with many heavy duties, of which a con&s;iderable part was not drawn back upon exportation. Madeira wine, not being a European commodity, could be imported directly into America and the We&s;t Indies, countries which, in all their non-enumerated com|modities, enjoyed a free trade to the i&s;land of Madeira. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances had probably introduced that general ta&s;te for Madeira wine, which our officers found e&s;tabli&s;hed in all our colonies at the commencement of the war, which began in 1755, and which they brought back with them to the mother-country, where that wine had not been much in fa&s;hion before. Upon the conclu&s;ion of that war, in 1763 (by the 4th Geo. III. Chap. 15. Sect. 12), all the duties, except 3<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> were allowed to be drawn back, upon the exportation to the colonies of all wines, except French wines, to the commerce and con&s;umption of which, national prejudice would al|low no &s;ort of encouragement. The period between the granting of this indulgence and the revolt of our North American colonies was probably too &s;hort to admit of any con&s;iderable change in the cu&s;toms of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame act, which, in the drawback upon all wines, except French wines, thus favoured the colonies &s;o much more than other countries; in tho&s;e, upon the greater part of other commodities, favoured them much le&s;s. Upon the exportation of the greater part of commodities to other countries, half the old &s;ub&s;idy was drawn back. But this law enacted, that no part of that duty &s;hould be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of any commodities, of the growth or manufacture either of Europe or the Ea&s;t Indies, except wines, white callicoes and mu&s;lins.</P>

<P>IT has happened in France, as well as in England, though in France there was, not only no bounty, but, till 1764, the export|ation of corn was &s;ubjected to a general prohibition. This gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable, therefore, is ulti|mately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the other, but to that gradual and in&s;en&s;ible ri&s;e in the real value of &s;ilver, which, in the fir&s;t book of this di&s;cour&s;e, I have endeavoured to &s;how has taken place in the general market of Europe, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century.

<P>BUT it has been thought by many people that it tends to encou|rage tillage, and that in two different ways; fir&s;t, by opening a more exten&s;ive foreign market to the corn of the farmer, it tends, they imagine, to increa&s;e the demand for, and con&s;equently the production of, that commodity; and, &s;econdly, by &s;ecuring to him a better price than he could otherwi&s;e expect in the actual &s;tate of til|lage, it tends, they &s;uppo&s;e, to encourage tillage. This double en|couragement mu&s;t, they imagine, in a long period of years, occa|&s;ion &s;uch an increa&s;e in the production of corn, as may lower its price in the home market, much more than the bounty can rai&s;e it, in the actual &s;tate which tillage may, at the end of that period, happen to be in.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that whatever exten&s;ion of the foreign market can be occa&s;ioned by the bounty, mu&s;t, in every particular year, be al|together at the expence of the home market; as every bu&s;hel of corn which is exported by means of the bounty, and which would
<PB N="11" REF="11">
not have been exported without the bounty, would have remained in the home market to increa&s;e the con&s;umption, and to lower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is to be ob&s;erved, as well as every other bounty upon exportation, impo&s;es two dif|ferent taxes upon the people; fir&s;t, the tax which they are obliged to contribute, in order to pay the bounty; and &s;econdly, the tax which ari&s;es from the advanced price of the commodity in the home|market, and which, as the whole body of the people are purcha&s;ers of corn, mu&s;t, in this particular commodity, be paid by the whole body of the people. In this particular commodity, therefore, this &s;econd tax is by much the heavie&s;t of the two. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that, taking one year with another, the bounty of five &s;hillings upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat, rai&s;es the price of that commodity in the home-market, only &s;ixpence the bu&s;hel, or four &s;hillings the quarter, higher than it otherwi&s;e would have been in the actual &s;tate of the crop. Even upon this very moderate &s;uppo|&s;ition, the great body of the people, over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of five &s;hillings upon every quarter of wheat exported, mu&s;t pay another of four &s;hillings upon every quarter which they them&s;elves con&s;ume. But, according to the very well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade, the average proportion of the corn exported to that con&s;umed at home, is not more than that of one to thirty-one. For every five &s;hillings, therefore, which they contribute to the payment of the fir&s;t tax, they mu&s;t contribute &s;ix pounds four &s;hillings to the payment of the &s;econd. So very heavy a tax upon the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life, mu&s;t either reduce the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labouring poor, or it mu&s;t occa|&s;ion &s;ome augmentation in their pecuniary wages, proportionable to that in the pecuniary price of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. So far as it operates in the one way, it mu&s;t reduce the ability of the la|bouring poor to educate and bring up their children, and mu&s;t, &s;o far, tend to re&s;train the population of the country. So far as it
<PB N="12" REF="12">
operates in the other, it mu&s;t reduce the ability of the employers of the poor, to employ &s;o great a number as they otherwi&s;e might do, and mu&s;t, &s;o far, tend to re&s;train the indu&s;try of the country. The extraordinary exportation of corn, therefore, occa&s;ioned by the bounty, not only, in every particular year, dimini&s;hes the home, ju&s;t as much as it extends the foreign market and con&s;umption, but, by re&s;training the population and indu&s;try of the country, its final tendency is to &s;tunt and re&s;train the gradual exten&s;ion of the home|market; and thereby, in the long-run, rather to dimini&s;h, than to augment, the whole market and con&s;umption of corn.</P>
<P>THIS enhancement of the money-price of corn, however, it has been thought, by rendering that commodity more profitable to the farmer, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily encourage its production.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that this might be the ca&s;e if the effect of the bounty was to rai&s;e the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer, with an equal quantity of it, to maintain a greater number of labourers in the &s;ame manner, whether liberal, moderate, or &s;canty, that other labourers are commonly maintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is evident, nor any other human in&s;titution, can have any &s;uch effect. It is not the real, but the nominal price of corn, which can in any con&s;iderable degree be affected by the bounty. And though the tax which that in&s;titution impo&s;es upon the whole body of the people, may be very burden&s;ome to tho&s;e who pay it, it is of very little advantage to tho&s;e who receive it.</P>

<P>IN the purcha&s;e of foreign commodities this enhancement in the price of corn may give them &s;ome little advantage. In that of home|made commodities it can give them none at all.

<P>THEY loaded the publick revenue with a very con&s;iderable expence; they impo&s;ed a very heavy tax upon the whole body of the people; but they did not, in any &s;en&s;ible degree, increa&s;e the real value of their own commodity; and by lowering &s;omewhat the real value of &s;ilver, they di&s;couraged, in &s;ome degree, the general indu&s;try of the country, and, in&s;tead of advancing, retarded more or le&s;s the improvement of their own lands, which nece&s;&s;arily depends upon the general indu&s;try of the country.</P>
<P>To encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon production, one &s;hould imagine, would have a more direct opera|tion, than one upon exportation. It would, be&s;ides, impo&s;e only one tax upon the people, that which they mu&s;t contribute in order to pay the bounty. In&s;tead of rai&s;ing, it would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home market; and thereby, in&s;tead of impo&s;ing a &s;econd tax upon the people, it might, at lea&s;t, in part, repay them for what they had contributed to the fir&s;t. Bounties upon production, however, have been very rarely granted.</P>

<HEAD>VOL. II. p. 104. line 18. in&s;tead of the paragraph beginning with <HI>Something like a bounty upon production,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;ert what follows:</HEAD>
<P>SOMETHING like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions. The tonnage bounties given to the white-herring and whale-fi&s;heries may, perhaps, be con&s;ider|ed as &s;omewhat of this nature. They tend directly, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, to render the goods cheaper in the home market than they otherwi&s;e would be. In other re&s;pects their effects, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of bounties upon exportation. By
<PB N="14" REF="14">
means of them a part of the capital of the country is employed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does not repay the co&s;t, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock.</P>
<P>BUT though the tonnage bounties to tho&s;e fi&s;heries do not con|tribute to the opulence of the nation, it may perhaps be thought, that they contribute to its defence, by augmenting the number of its &s;ailors and &s;hipping. This, it may be alleged, may &s;ometimes be done by means of &s;uch bounties at a much &s;maller expence, than by keeping up a great &s;tanding navy, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ame way as a &s;tanding army.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e favourable allegations, however, the following con&s;iderations di&s;po&s;e me to believe, that in granting at lea&s;t one of the&s;e bounties, the legi&s;lature has been very gro&s;sly im|po&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>FIRST, the herring bu&s;s bounty &s;eems too large.</P>
<P>FROM the commencement of the winter fi&s;hing 1771 to the end of the winter fi&s;hing 1781, the tonnage bounty upon the herring bu&s;s fi&s;hery has been at thirty &s;hillings the ton. During the&s;e eleven years the whole number of barrels caught by the herring bu&s;s fi&s;hery of Scotland amounted to 378,347. The herrings caught and cured at &s;ea, are called &s;ea&s;teeks. In order to render them what are called merchantable herrings, it is nece&s;&s;ary to repack them with an additional quantity of &s;alt; and in this ca&s;e, it is reckoned, that three barrels of &s;ea&s;teeks, are u&s;ually repacked into two barrels of mer|chantable herrings. The number of barrels of merchantable her|rings, therefore, caught during the&s;e eleven years, will amount only, according to this account, to 252,231&frac13;. During the&s;e eleven years the tonnage bounties paid amounted to 155,463<HI>l.</HI> 11<HI>s.</HI> or to 8<HI>s.</HI> 2&frac14;<HI>d.</HI> upon every barrel of &s;ea&s;teeks, and to 12<HI>s.</HI> 3&frac34;<HI>d.</HI> upon every barrel of merchantable herrings.</P>
<P>THE &s;alt with which the&s;e herrings are cured, is &s;ometimes Scotch, and &s;ometimes foreign &s;alt; both which are delivered free
<PB N="15" REF="15">
of all exci&s;e duty to the fi&s;h-curers. The exci&s;e duty upon Scotch &s;alt is at pre&s;ent 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> that upon foreign &s;alt 10<HI>s.</HI> the bu&s;hel. A barrel of herrings is &s;uppo&s;ed to require about one bu&s;hel and one-fourth of a bu&s;hel foreign &s;alt. Two bu&s;hels are the &s;uppo&s;ed average of Scotch &s;alt. If the herrings are entered for exportation, no part of this duty is paid up; if entered for home con&s;umption, whether the herrings were cured with foreign or with Scotch &s;alt, only one &s;hilling the barrel is paid up. It was the old Scotch duty upon a bu&s;hel of &s;alt, the quantity which, at a low e&s;timation, had been &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary for curing a barrel of herrings. In Scot|land, foreign &s;alt is very little u&s;ed for any other purpo&s;e but the curing of fi&s;h. But from the 5th April 1771, to the 5th April 1782, the quantity of foreign &s;alt imported amounted to 936,974 bu&s;hels, at eighty-four pounds the bu&s;hel: the quantity of Scotch &s;alt, delivered from the works to the fi&s;h-curers, to no more than 168,226, at fifty-&s;ix pounds the bu&s;hel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is principally foreign &s;alt that is u&s;ed in the fi&s;heries. Upon every barrel of herrings exported there is, be&s;ides, a bounty of 2<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> and more than two-thirds of the bu&s;s caught herrings are exported. Put all the&s;e things together and you will find, that, during the&s;e eleven years, every barrel of bu&s;s caught herrings, cured with Scotch &s;alt, when exported, has co&s;t government 17<HI>s.</HI> 11&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; and when entered for home con&s;umption 14<HI>s.</HI> 3&frac34;<HI>d.:</HI> and that every barrel cured with foreign &s;alt, when exported, has co&s;t government 1<HI>l.</HI> 7<HI>s.</HI> 5&frac34;<HI>d.</HI>; and when entered for home con|&s;umption 1<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 9&frac34;<HI>d.</HI> The price of a barrel of good merchant|able herrings runs from &s;eventeen and eighteen to four and five and twenty &s;hillings; about a guinea at an average.</P>
<P>THE two following accounts are &s;ubjoined, in order to illu&s;trate and confirm what is &s;aid above concerning the tonnage bounty to the white herring fi&s;hery. The Reader, I believe, may depend upon the accuracy of both accounts.</P>

SECONDLY, the bounty to the white herring fi&s;hery is a tonnage bounty; and is proportioned to the burden of the &s;hip, not to her diligence or &s;ucce&s;s in the fi&s;hery; and it has, I am afraid, been too common for ve&s;&s;els to fit out for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of catching, not the fi&s;h, but the bounty. In the year 1759, when the bounty was at fifty &s;hillings the ton, the whole bu&s;s fi&s;hery of Scotland brought in only four barrels of &s;ea&s;teeks. In that year each barrel of &s;ea|&s;teeks co&s;t government in bounties alone 113<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>s.</HI>; each barrel of merchantable herrings 159<HI>l.</HI> 7<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY, the mode of fi&s;hing for which this tonnage bounty in the white herring fi&s;hery has been given (by bu&s;&s;es or decked ve&s;&s;els from twenty to eighty tons burden) &s;eems not &s;o well adapted to the &s;ituation of Scotland as to that of Holland; from the practice of which country it appears to have been borrowed. Holland lies at a great di&s;tance from the &s;eas to which herrings are known prin|cipally to re&s;ort; and can, therefore, carry on that fi&s;hery only in decked ve&s;&s;els, which can carry water and provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for a voyage to a di&s;tant &s;ea. But the Hebrides or we&s;tern i&s;lands, the i&s;lands of Shetland, and the northern and north-we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Scotland, the countries in who&s;e neighbourhood the herring fi&s;hery is principally carried on, are every where inter&s;ected by arms of the &s;ea which run up a con&s;iderable way into the land, and which, in the language of the country, are called &s;ea-lochs. It is to the&s;e &s;ea-lochs that the herrings principally re&s;ort, during the &s;ea&s;ons in which they vi&s;it tho&s;e &s;eas; for the vi&s;its of this, and, I am a&s;&s;ured, of many other &s;orts of fi&s;h, are not quite regular and con&s;tant. A boat fi&s;hery, therefore, &s;eems to be the mode of fi&s;hing be&s;t adapted to the peculiar &s;ituation of Scotland; the fi&s;hers carrying the her|rings on &s;hore, as fa&s;t as they are taken, to be either cured or con|&s;umed fre&s;h. But the great encouragement, which a bounty of thirty &s;hillings the ton gives to the bu&s;s fi&s;hery, is nece&s;&s;arily a di&s;courage|ment to the boat fi&s;hery; which, having no &s;uch bounty, cannot
<PB N="20" REF="20">
bring its cured fi&s;h to market upon the &s;ame terms as the bu&s;s fi&s;hery. The boat-fi&s;hery, accordingly, which, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bu&s;s bounty, was very con&s;iderable, and is &s;aid to have employed a number of &s;eamen, not inferior to what the bu&s;s fi&s;hery employs at pre&s;ent, is now gone almo&s;t entirely to decay. Of the former ex|tent, however, of this now ruined and abandoned fi&s;hery, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I cannot pretend to &s;peak with much preci&s;ion. As no bounty was paid upon the outfit of the boat-fi&s;hery, no ac|count was taken of it by the officers of the cu&s;toms or &s;alt duties.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, in many parts of Scotland, during certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, herrings make no incon&s;iderable part of the food of the common people. A bounty, which tended to lower their price in the home market, might contribute a good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellow-&s;ubjects, who&s;e circum&s;tances are by no means affluent. But the herring bu&s;s bounty contributes to no &s;uch good purpo&s;e. It has ruined the boat fi&s;hery, which is, by far, the be&s;t adapted for the &s;upply of the home market, and the additional bounty of 2<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> the barrel upon exportation, carries the greater part, more than two-thirds, of the produce of the bu&s;s fi&s;hery abroad. Between thirty and forty years ago, before the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the bu&s;s bounty, &s;ixteen &s;hillings the barrel, I have been a&s;&s;ured, was the common price of white herrings. Between ten and fifteen years ago, before the boat fi&s;hery was entirely ruined, the price is &s;aid to have run from &s;eventeen to twenty &s;hillings the barrel. For the&s;e la&s;t five years, it has, at an average, been at twenty-five &s;hillings the barrel. This high price, however, may have been owing to the real &s;carcity of the herrings upon the coa&s;t of Scot|land. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve too, that the ca&s;k or barrel, which is u&s;ually &s;old with the herrings, and of which the price is included in all the foregoing prices, has, &s;ince the commencement of the American war, ri&s;en to about double its former price, or from about three &s;hil|lings,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
to about &s;ix &s;hillings. I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that the ac|counts I have received of the prices of former times, have been by no means quite uniform and con&s;i&s;tent; and an old man of great accuracy and experience has a&s;&s;ured me, that more than fifty years ago, a guinea was the u&s;ual price of a barrel of good merchant|able herrings; and this, I imagine, may &s;till be looked upon as the average price. All accounts, however, I think, agree, that the price has not been lowered in the home market, in con&s;equence of the bu&s;s bounty.</P>
<P>WHEN the undertakers of fi&s;heries, after &s;uch liberal bounties have been be&s;towed upon them, continue to &s;ell their commodity at the &s;ame, or even at a higher price than they were accu&s;tomed to do before, it might be expected that their profits &s;hould be very great; and it is not improbable that tho&s;e of &s;ome individuals may have been &s;o. In general, however, I have every rea&s;on to believe, they have been quite otherwi&s;e. The u&s;ual effect of &s;uch bounties is to encourage ra&s;h undertakers to adventure in a bu&s;ine&s;s, which they do not under&s;tand, and what they lo&s;e by their own negligence and ignorance, more than compen&s;ates all that they can gain by the ut|mo&s;t liberality of government. In 1750, by the &s;ame act, which fir&s;t gave the bounty of thirty &s;hillings the ton for the encourage|ment of the white herring fi&s;hery (the 23 Geo. II. chap. 24.), a joint &s;tock company was erected, with a capital of five hundred thou&s;and pounds, to which the &s;ub&s;cribers (over and above all other encouragements, the tonnage bounty ju&s;t now mentioned, the ex|portation bounty of two &s;hillings and eight pence the barrel, the de|livery of both Briti&s;h and foreign &s;alt duty free) were, during the &s;pace of fourteen years, for every hundred pounds which they &s;ub|&s;cribed and paid in to the &s;tock of the &s;ociety, entitled to three pounds a year, to be paid by the receiver-general of the cu&s;toms in equal half-yearly payments. Be&s;ides this great company, the re&s;i|dence of who&s;e governor and directors was to be in London, it was
<PB N="22" REF="22">
declared lawful to erect different fi&s;hing-chambers, in all the diffe|rent out-ports of the kingdom, provided a &s;um not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and pounds was &s;ub&s;cribed into the capital of each, to be ma|naged at its own ri&s;k, and for its own profit and lo&s;s. The &s;ame annuity, and the &s;ame encouragement of all kinds, were given to the trade of tho&s;e inferior chambers, as to that of the great company. The &s;ub&s;cription of the great company was &s;oon filled up, and &s;everal different fi&s;hing-chambers were erected in the different out-ports of the kingdom. In &s;pite of all the&s;e encouragements, almo&s;t all tho&s;e different companies, both great and &s;mall, lo&s;t either the whole, or the greater part of their capitals; &s;carce a ve&s;tige now remains of any of them, and the white herring fi&s;hery is now entirely, or al|mo&s;t entirely, carried on by private adventurers.</P>
<P>IF any particular manufacture was nece&s;&s;ary, indeed, for the de|fence of the &s;ociety, it might not always be prudent to depend upon our neighbours for the &s;upply; and if &s;uch manufacture could not otherwi&s;e be &s;upported at home, it might not be unrea&s;onable that all the other branches of indu&s;try &s;hould be taxed in order to &s;upport it. The bounties upon the exportation of Briti&s;h-made &s;ail-cloth, and Briti&s;h-made gun-powder, may, perhaps, both be vindicated upon this principle.</P>
<P>BUT though it can very &s;eldom be rea&s;onable to tax the indu&s;try of the great body of the people, in order to &s;upport that of &s;ome par|ticular cla&s;s of manufacturers; yet in the wantonne&s;s of great pro|&s;perity, when the publick enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with, to give &s;uch bounties to favourite manufactures, may, perhaps, be as natural, as to incur any other idle expence. In publick, as well as in private expences, great wealth may, perhaps, frequently be admitted as an apology for great folly. But there mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;omething more than ordinary ab&s;urdity, in conti|nuing &s;uch profu&s;ion in times of general difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>CHAP. VIII.</P>
<P><HI>Conclu&s;ion of the Mercantile Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the encouragement of exportation, and the di&s;|couragement of importation, are the two great engines by which the mercantile &s;y&s;tem propo&s;es to enrich every country, yet, with regard to &s;ome particular commodities, it &s;eems to follow an oppo&s;ite plan: to di&s;courage exportation, and to encourage import|ation. Its ultimate object, however, it pretends, is always the &s;ame, to enrich the country by an advantageous balance of trade. It di&s;courages the exportation of the materials of manufacture, and of the in&s;truments of trade, in order to give our own workmen an advantage, and to enable them to under&s;ell tho&s;e of other nations in all foreign markets: and by re&s;training, in this manner, the export|ation of a few commodities, of no great price, it propo&s;es to occa|&s;ion a much greater and more valuable exportation of others. It encourages the importation of the materials of manufacture, in order that our own people may be enabled to work them up more cheaply, and thereby prevent a greater and more valuable importation of the manufactured commodities. I do not ob&s;erve, at lea&s;t in our Statute Book, any encouragement given to the importation of the in&s;tru|ments of trade. When manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of greatne&s;s, the fabrication of the in&s;truments of trade be|comes it&s;elf the object of a great number of very important manu|factures. To give any particular encouragement to the importation of &s;uch in&s;truments, would interfere too much with the intere&s;t of tho&s;e manufactures. Such importation, therefore, in&s;tead of being encouraged, has frequently been prohibited. Thus the importation
<PB N="24" REF="24">
of wool cards, except from Ireland, or when brought in as wreck or prize goods, was prohibited by the 3d of Edward IV.; which pro|hibition was renewed by the 39th of Elizabeth, and has been conti|nued and rendered perpetual by &s;ub&s;equent laws.</P>
<P>THE importation of the materials of manufacture has &s;ometimes been encouraged by an exemption from the duties to which other goods are &s;ubject, and &s;ometimes by bounties.</P>
<P>THE importation of &s;heep's wool from &s;everal different countries, of cotton wool from all countries, of undre&s;&s;ed flax, of the greater part of dying drugs, of the greater part of undre&s;&s;ed hides from Ireland or the Briti&s;h colonies, of &s;eal &s;kins from the Briti&s;h Green|land fi&s;hery, of pig and bar iron from the Briti&s;h colonies, as well as of &s;everal other materials of manufacture, has been encouraged by an exemption from all duties, if properly entered at the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e. The private intere&s;t of our merchants and manufacturers may, perhaps, have extorted from the legi&s;lature the&s;e exemptions, as well as the greater part of our other commercial regulations. They are, however, perfectly ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and if, con&s;i&s;tently with the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, they could be extended to all the other materials of manufacture, the publick would certainly be a gainer.</P>
<P>THE avidity of our great manufacturers, however, has in &s;ome ca&s;es extended the&s;e exemptions a good deal beyond what can ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the rude materials of their work. By the 24 Geo. II. chap. 46. a &s;mall duty of only one penny the pound was impo&s;ed upon the importation of foreign brown linen yarn, in&s;tead of much higher duties to which it had been &s;ubjected before, viz. of &s;ixpence the pound upon &s;ail yarn, of one &s;hilling the pound upon all French and Dutch yarn, and of two pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four pence upon the hundred weight of all &s;pruce or Mu&s;covia yarn. But our manufacturers were not long &s;atisfied with this reduction. By the 29th of the &s;ame king, chap. 15. the &s;ame law which gave a bounty upon the exportation of Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h linen of which the price
<PB N="25" REF="25">
did not exceed eighteen pence the yard, even this &s;mall duty upon the importation of brown linen yarn was taken away. In the dif|ferent operations, however, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the preparation of linen yarn, a good deal more indu&s;try is employed, than in the &s;ub&s;equent operation of preparing linen cloth from linen yarn. To &s;ay nothing of the indu&s;try of the flax-growers and flax-dre&s;&s;ers, three or four &s;pinners, at lea&s;t, are nece&s;&s;ary, in order to keep one weaver in con&s;tant employment; and more than four-fifths of the whole quantity of labour, nece&s;&s;ary for the preparation of linen cloth, is employed in that of linen yarn; but our &s;pinners are poor people, women commonly, &s;cattered about in all different parts of the country, without &s;upport or protection. It is not by the &s;ale of their work, but by that of the complete work of the weavers, that our great ma&s;ter manufacturers make their profits. As it is their in|tere&s;t to &s;ell the complete manufacture as dear, &s;o is it to buy the materials as cheap, as po&s;&s;ible. By extorting from the legi&s;lature, bounties upon the exportation of their own linen, high duties upon the importation of all foreign linen, and a total prohibition of the home con&s;umption of &s;ome &s;orts of French linen, they endeavour to &s;ell their own goods as dear as po&s;&s;ible. By encouraging the im|portation of foreign linen yarn, and thereby bringing it into com|petition with that which is made by our own people, they endea|vour to buy the work of the poor &s;pinners as cheap as po&s;&s;ible. They are as intent to keep down the wages of their own weavers, as the earnings of the poor &s;pinners; and it is by no means for the benefit of the workman, that they endeavour either to rai&s;e the price of the compleat work, or to lower that of the rude materials. It is the in|du&s;try which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the power|ful, that is principally encouraged by our mercantile &s;y&s;tem. That which is carried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent, is, too often, either neglected, or oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">
BOTH the bounty upon the exportation of linen, and the exemp|tion from duty upon the importation of foreign yarn, which were granted only for fifteen years, but continued by two different pro|longations, expire with the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament which &s;hall immediately follow the 24th of June 1786.</P>
<P>THE encouragement given to the importation of the materials of manufacture by bounties, has been principally confined to &s;uch as were imported from our American plantations.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bounties of this kind were tho&s;e granted, about the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, upon the importation of naval &s;tores from America. Under this denomination were comprehended timber fit for ma&s;ts, yards, and bow&s;prits; hemp; tar, pitch, and turpentine. The bounty, however, of one pound the ton upon ma&s;ting-timber, and that of &s;ix pounds the ton upon hemp, were extended to &s;uch as &s;hould be imported into England from Scotland. Both the&s;e bounties continued, without any variation, at the &s;ame rate, till they were &s;everally allowed to expire; that upon hemp on the 1&s;t of January 1741, and that upon ma&s;ting-timber at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament immediately following the 24th June 1781.</P>
<P>THE bounties upon the importation of tar, pitch, and turpen|tine underwent, during their continuance, &s;everal alterations. Ori|ginally that upon tar was four pounds the ton; that upon pitch, the &s;ame; and that upon turpentine, three pounds the ton. The bounty of four pounds the ton upon tar was afterwards confined to &s;uch as had been prepared in a particular manner; that upon other good, clean, and merchantable tar was reduced to two pounds four &s;hillings the ton. The bounty upon pitch was likewi&s;e reduced to one pound; and that upon turpentine to one pound ten &s;hillings the ton.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd bounty upon the importation of any of the materials of manufacture, according to the order of time, was that granted by
<PB N="27" REF="27">
the 21 Geo. II. chap. 30. upon the importation of indigo from the Briti&s;h plantations. When the plantation indigo was worth three-fourths of the price of the be&s;t French indigo, it was by this act entitled to a bounty of &s;ixpence the pound. This bounty, which, like mo&s;t others, was granted only for a limited time, was con|tinued by &s;everal prolongations, but was reduced to four pence the pound. It was allowed to expire with the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament which followed the 25th March 1781.</P>
<P>THE third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the time that we were beginning &s;ometimes to court and &s;ometimes to quarrel with our American colonies) by the 4 Geo. III. chap. 26. upon the importation of hemp, or undre&s;&s;ed flax from the Briti&s;h plantations. This bounty was granted for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1764, to the 24th June 1785. For the fir&s;t &s;even years it was to be at the rate of eight pounds the ton, for the &s;econd at &s;ix pounds, and for the third at four pounds. It was not extend|ed to Scotland, of which the climate (although hemp is &s;ometimes rai&s;ed there in &s;mall quantities, and of an inferior quality) is not very fit for that produce. Such a bounty upon the importation of Scotch flax into England would have been too great a di&s;courage|ment to the native produce of the &s;outhern part of the united kingdom.</P>
<P>THE fourth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 5 Geo. III. chap. 45. upon the importation of wood from America. It was granted for nine years, from the 1&s;t January 1766, to the 1&s;t January 1775. During the fir&s;t three years, it was to be for every hundred and twenty good deals, at the rate of one pound; and for every load containing fifty cubic feet of other &s;quared timber, at the rate of twelve &s;hillings. For the &s;econd three years, it was for deals to be at the rate of fifteen &s;hillings, and for other &s;quared timber, at the rate of eight &s;hillings; and for the third three years, it was for deals,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
to be at the rate of ten &s;hillings, and for other &s;quared timber, at the rate of five &s;hillings.</P>
<P>THE fifth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 9 Geo. III. chap. 38. upon the importation of raw &s;ilk from the Briti&s;h plant|ations. It was granted for twenty-one years, from the 1&s;t January 1770, to the 1&s;t January 1791. For the fir&s;t &s;even years it was to be at the rate of twenty-five pounds for every hundred pounds value; for the &s;econd, at twenty pounds; and for the third, at fifteen pounds. The management of the &s;ilk-worm, and the preparation of &s;ilk, requires &s;o much hand labour; and labour is &s;o very dear in America, that even this great bounty, I have been informed, was not likely to produce any con&s;iderable effect.</P>
<P>THE &s;ixth bounty of this kind was that granted by 11 Geo. III. chap. 50. for the importation of pipe, hog&s;head, and barrel &s;taves and heading from the Briti&s;h plantations. It was granted for nine years, from 1&s;t January 1772, to the 1&s;t January 1781. For the fir&s;t three years, it was for a certain quantity of each, to be at the rate of &s;ix pounds; for the &s;econd three years, at four pounds; and for the third three years, at two pounds.</P>
<P>THE &s;eventh, and la&s;t bounty of this kind was granted by the 19 Geo. III. chap. 37. upon the importation of hemp from Ireland. It was granted in the &s;ame manner as that for the importation of hemp and undre&s;&s;ed flax from America, for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1779, to the 24th June 1800. This term is divided, likewi&s;e, into three periods of &s;even years each; and in each of tho&s;e periods, the rate of the Iri&s;h bounty is the &s;ame with that of the American. It does not, however, like the American bounty, extend to the importation of undre&s;&s;ed flax. It would have been too great a di&s;couragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great Britain. When this la&s;t bounty was granted, the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h legi&s;latures were not in much better humour with one another than
<PB N="29" REF="29">
the Briti&s;h and American had been before. But this boon to Ireland, it is to be hoped, has been granted under more fortunate au&s;pices, than all tho&s;e to America.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame commodities upon which we thus gave bounties, when imported from America, were &s;ubjected to con&s;iderable duties when imported from any other country. The intere&s;t of our American colonies was regarded as the &s;ame with that of the mother country. Their wealth was con&s;idered as our wealth. Whatever money was &s;ent out to them, it was &s;aid, came all back to us by the balance of trade, and we could never become a farthing the poorer, by any expence which we could lay out upon them. They were our own in every re&s;pect, and it was an expence laid out upon the improve|ment of our own property, and for the profitable employment of our own people. It is unnece&s;&s;ary, I apprehend, at pre&s;ent to &s;ay any thing further, in order to expo&s;e the folly of a &s;y&s;tem, which fatal experience has now &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed. Had our American colonies really been a part of Great Britain, tho&s;e bounties might have been con&s;idered as bounties upon production, and would &s;till have been liable to all the objections to which &s;uch bounties are liable, but to no other.</P>
<P>THE exportation of the materials of manufacture is &s;ometimes di&s;|couraged by ab&s;olute prohibitions, and &s;ometimes by high duties.</P>
<P>OUR woollen manufacturers have been more &s;ucce&s;sful than any other cla&s;s of workmen, in per&s;uading the legi&s;lature, that the pro|&s;perity of the nation depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s and exten&s;ion of their particular bu&s;ine&s;s. They have not only obtained a monopoly again&s;t the con&s;umers by an ab&s;olute prohibition of importing woollen cloths from any foreign country; but they have likewi&s;e obtained another monopoly again&s;t the &s;heep farmers and growers of wool, by a &s;imilar prohibition of the exportation of live &s;heep and wool. The &s;everity of many of the laws which have been enacted for the &s;ecurity of the revenue is very ju&s;tly complained of, as impo&s;ing
<PB N="30" REF="30">
heavy penalties upon actions which, antecedent to the &s;tatutes that declared them to be crimes, had always been under&s;tood to be innocent. But the cruelle&s;t of our revenue laws, I will venture to affirm, are mild and gentle, in compari&s;on of &s;ome of tho&s;e which the clamour of our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legi&s;lature, for the &s;upport of their own ab&s;urd and oppre&s;&s;ive monopolies. Like the laws of Draco, the&s;e laws may be &s;aid to be all written in blood.</P>
<P>BY the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3. the exporter of &s;heep, lambs or rams, was for the fir&s;t offence to forfeit all his goods for ever, to &s;uffer a year's impri&s;onment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market town upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the &s;econd offence to be adjudged a felon, and to &s;uffer death ac|cordingly. To prevent the breed of our &s;heep from being propa|gated in foreign countries, &s;eems to have been the object of this law. By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 18. the exportation of wool was made felony, and the exporter &s;ubjected to the &s;ame pe|nalties and forfeitures as a felon.</P>
<P>FOR the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that neither of the&s;e &s;tatutes were ever executed. The fir&s;t of them, however, &s;o far as I know, has never been directly repealed, and Ser|jeant Hawkins &s;eems to con&s;ider it as &s;till in force. It may, how|ever, perhaps, be con&s;idered as virtually repealed by the 12th of Charles II. chap. 32. &s;ect. 3. which, without expre&s;sly taking away the penalties impo&s;ed by former &s;tatutes, impo&s;es a new penalty, viz. That of twenty &s;hillings for every &s;heep exported, or attempted to be exported, together with the forfeiture of the &s;heep and of the owner's &s;hare of the &s;hip. The &s;econd of them was expre&s;sly re|pealed by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 28. &s;ect. 4. By which it is declared that,  <Q REND="inline">"Whereas the &s;tatute of the 13th and 14th of king Charles II. made again&s;t the exportation of wool, among other things in the &s;aid act mentioned, doth enact the &s;ame to be
<PB N="31" REF="31">
deemed felony; by the &s;everity of which penalty the pro&s;ecution of offenders hath not been &s;o effectually put in execution: Be it, therefore, enacted by the authority fore&s;aid, that &s;o much of the &s;aid act, which relates to the making the &s;aid offence felony, be repealed and made void."</Q></P>
<P>THE penalties, however, which are either impo&s;ed by this milder &s;tatute, or which, though impo&s;ed by former &s;tatutes, are not re|pealed by this one, are &s;till &s;ufficiently &s;evere. Be&s;ides the for|feiture of the goods, the exporter incurs the penalty of three &s;hil|lings for every pound weight of wool either exported or attempted to be exported, that is about four or five times the value. Any merchant or other per&s;on convicted of this offence is di&s;abled from requiring any debt or account belonging to him from any factor or other per&s;on. Let his fortune be what it will, whether he is, or is not able to pay tho&s;e heavy penalties, the law means to ruin him completely. But as the morals of the great body of the people are not yet &s;o corrupt as tho&s;e of the contrivers of this &s;tatute, I have not heard that any advantage has ever been taken of this clau&s;e. If the per&s;on convicted of this offence is not able to pay the penalties within three months after judgment, he is to be tran&s;ported for &s;even years; and if he returns before the expiration of that term, he is liable to the pains of felony, without benefit of clergy. The owner of the &s;hip knowing this offence forfeits all his intere&s;t in the &s;hip and furniture. The ma&s;ter and mariners knowing this offence forfeit all their goods and chattels, and &s;uffer three months impri&s;onment. By a &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatute the ma&s;ter &s;uffers &s;ix months impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool is laid under very burden&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive re&s;trictions. It cannot be packed in any box, barrel, ca&s;k, ca&s;e, che&s;t, or any other package, but only in packs of leather or pack-cloth, on which mu&s;t be marked on the out&s;ide the words <HI>wool</HI> or <HI>yarn,</HI> in large letters not le&s;s than three inches long, on pain of forfeiting the &s;ame and the package, and
<PB N="32" REF="32">
three &s;hillings for every pound weight, to be paid by the owner or packer. It cannot be loaden on any hor&s;e or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coa&s;t, but between &s;un-ri&s;ing and &s;un|&s;etting, on pain of forfeiting the &s;ame, the hor&s;es and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the &s;ea coa&s;t, out of, or through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits twenty pounds, if the wool is under the value of ten pounds; and if of greater value, then treble that value, together with treble co&s;ts, to be &s;ued for within the year. The execution to be again&s;t any two of the inhabitants, whom the &s;e&s;&s;ions mu&s;t reimbur&s;e, by an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on the other in|habitants, as in the ca&s;es of robbery. And if any per&s;on compounds with the hundred for le&s;s than this penalty, he is to be impri&s;oned for five years; and any other per&s;on may pro&s;ecute. The&s;e regu|lations take place through the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT in the particular counties of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex the re&s;trictions are &s;till more trouble&s;ome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the &s;ea-coa&s;t mu&s;t give an account in writing, three days after &s;hearing, to the next officer of the cu&s;toms, of the number of his fleeces, and of the places where they are lodged. And before he re|moves any part of them he mu&s;t give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of the name and abode of the per&s;on to whom they are &s;old, and of the place to which it is intended they &s;hould be carried. No per&s;on within fifteen miles of the &s;ea, in the &s;aid counties, can buy any wool, before he enters into bond to the king, that no part of the wool which he &s;hall &s;o buy, &s;hall be &s;old by him to any other per&s;on within fifteen miles of the &s;ea. If any wool is found carrying towards the &s;ea-&s;ide in the &s;aid counties, unle&s;s it has been entered and &s;ecurity given as afore&s;aid, it is for|feited, and the offender al&s;o forfeits three &s;hillings for every pound weight. If any per&s;on lays any wool, not entered as afore&s;aid, within fifteen miles of the &s;ea, it mu&s;t be &s;eized and forfeited; and if, after &s;uch &s;eizure, any per&s;on &s;hall claim the &s;ame, he mu&s;t give
<PB N="33" REF="33">
&s;ecurity to the Exchequer, that if he is ca&s;t upon trial he &s;hall pay treble co&s;ts, be&s;ides all other penalties.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch re&s;trictions are impo&s;ed upon the inland trade, the coa&s;ting trade, we may believe, cannot be left very free. Every owner of wool who carrieth, or cau&s;eth to be carried, any wool to any port or place on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, in order to be from thence tran&s;port|ed by &s;ea to any other place or port on the coa&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t cau&s;e an entry thereof to be made at the port from whence it is intended to be conveyed, containing the weight, marks, and number of the packages before he brings the &s;ame within five miles of that port; on pain of forfeiting the &s;ame, and al&s;o the hor&s;es, carts, and other carriages; and al&s;o of &s;uffering and forfeiting, as by the other laws in force again&s;t the exportation of wool. This law, however, (1 Will. III. chap. 32.) is &s;o very indulgent as to declare, that <Q REND="inline">"this &s;hall not hinder any per&s;on from carrying his wool home from the place of &s;hearing, though it be within five miles of the &s;ea, provided that in ten days after &s;hearing, and before he remove the wool, he do under his hand certify to the next officer of the cu&s;|toms, the true number of fleeces, and where it is hou&s;ed; and do not remove the &s;ame, without certifying to &s;uch officer, under his hand, his intention &s;o to do, three days before."</Q> Bond mu&s;t be given that the wool to be carried coa&s;t-ways is to be landed at the particular port for which it is entered outwards; and if any part of it is landed without the pre&s;ence of an officer, not only the for|feiture of the wool is incurred as in other goods, but the u&s;ual addi|tional penalty of three &s;hillings for every pound weight is likewi&s;e incurred.</P>
<P>OUR woollen manufacturers, in order to ju&s;tify their demand of &s;uch extraordinary re&s;trictions and regulations, confidently a&s;&s;erted, that Engli&s;h wool was of a peculiar quality, &s;uperior to that of any other country; that the wool of other countries could not, without &s;ome mixture of it, be wrought up into any tolerable manufacture;
<PB N="34" REF="34">
that fine cloth could not be made without it; that England, there|fore, if the exportation of it could be totally prevented, could mo|nopolize to her&s;elf almo&s;t the whole woollen trade of the world; and thus, having no rivals, could &s;ell at what price &s;he plea&s;ed, and in a &s;hort time acquire the mo&s;t incredible degree of wealth by the mo&s;t advantageous balance of trade. This doctrine, like mo&s;t other doctrines which are confidently a&s;&s;erted by any con&s;iderable number of people, was, and &s;till continues to be, mo&s;t implicitly believed by a much greater number; by almo&s;t all tho&s;e who are either un|acquainted with the woollen trade, or who have not made particular inquiries. It is, however, &s;o perfectly fal&s;e, that Engli&s;h wool is in any re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary for the making of fine cloth, that it is alto|gether unfit for it. Fine cloth is made altogether of Spani&s;h wool. Engli&s;h wool cannot be even &s;o mixed with Spani&s;h wool as to enter into the compo&s;ition without &s;poiling and degrading, in &s;ome de|gree, the fabric of the cloth.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;hown in the foregoing part of this work, that the effect of the&s;e regulations has been to depre&s;s the price of Engli&s;h wool, not only below what it naturally would be in the pre&s;ent times, but very much below what it actually was in the time of Edward III. The price of Scots wool, when in con&s;equence of the union it became &s;ubject to the &s;ame regulations, is &s;aid to have fallen about one half. It is ob&s;erved by the very accurate and intelligent author of the Memoirs of Wool, the Reverend Mr. John Smith, that the price of the be&s;t Engli&s;h wool in England is generally below what wool of a very inferior quality commonly &s;ells for in the market of Am&s;terdam. To depre&s;s the price of this commodity below what may be called its natural and proper price, was the avowed purpo&s;e of tho&s;e regulations; and there &s;eems to be no doubt of their having produced the effect that was expected from them.</P>
<P>THIS reduction of price, it may perhaps be thought, by di&s;|couraging the growing of wool, mu&s;t have reduced very much the
<PB N="35" REF="35">
annual produce of that commodity, though not below what it for|merly was, yet below what, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it pro|bably would have been, had it, in con&s;equence of an open and free market, been allowed to ri&s;e to the natural and proper price. I am, however, di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that the quantity of the annual pro|duce cannot have been much, though it may perhaps have been a little, affected by the&s;e regulations. The growing of wool is not the chief purpo&s;e for which the &s;heep farmer employs his indu&s;try and &s;tock. He expects his profit, not &s;o much from the price of the the fleece, as from that of the carca&s;e; and the average or ordinary price of the latter, mu&s;t even, in many ca&s;es, make up to him whatever deficiency there may be in the average or ordinary price of the former. It has been ob&s;erved in the foregoing part of this work, that, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever regulations tend to &s;ink the price, either of wool or of raw hides, below what it naturally would be, mu&s;t, in an improved and cultivated country, have &s;ome tendency to rai&s;e the price of butchers meat. The price both of the great and &s;mall cattle which are fed on improved and cultivated land, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to pay the rent which the landlord, and the profit which the farmer has rea&s;on to expect from improved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will &s;oon cea&s;e to feed them. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide, mu&s;t be paid by the carca&s;e. The le&s;s there is paid for the one, the more mu&s;t be paid for the other. In what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts of the bea&s;t, is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to them. In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their intere&s;t as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by &s;uch regula|tions, though their intere&s;t as con&s;umers may, by the ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions."</Q> According to this rea&s;oning, therefore, this degradation in the price of wool is not likely, in an improved and cultivated country, to occa&s;ion any diminution in the annual produce
<PB N="36" REF="36">
of that commodity; except &s;o far as, by rai&s;ing the price of mutton, it may &s;omewhat dimini&s;h the demand for, and con&s;equently the production of, that particular &s;pecies of butchers meat. Its effect, however, even in this way, it is probable, is not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>BUT though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may not have been very con&s;iderable, its effect upon the quality, it may perhaps be thought, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been very great. The degradation in the quality of Engli&s;h wool, if not below what it was in former times, yet below what it naturally would have been in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement and cultivation, mu&s;t have been, it may perhaps be &s;uppo&s;ed, very nearly in proportion to the degradation of price. As the quality depends upon the breed, upon the pa&s;ture, and upon the management and cleanline&s;s of the &s;heep, during the whole progre&s;s of the growth of the fleece, the attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances, it may naturally enough be imagined, can never be greater than in proportion to the recompence which the price of the fleece is likely to make for the labour and expence which that atten|tion requires. It happens, however, that the goodne&s;s of the fleece depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the health, growth, and bulk of the animal; the &s;ame attention which is nece&s;&s;ary for the improve|ment of the carca&s;e, is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;ufficient for that of the fleece. Notwith&s;tanding the degradation of price, Engli&s;h wool is &s;aid to have been improved con&s;iderably during the cour&s;e even of the pre&s;ent century. The improvement might perhaps have been greater if the price had been better; but the lowne&s;s of price, though it may have ob&s;tructed, yet certainly it has not altogether prevented that improvement.</P>
<P>THE violence of the&s;e regulations, therefore, &s;eems to have affected neither the quantity nor the quality of the annual produce of wool &s;o much as it might have been expected to do; (though I think it pro|bable that it may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former) and the intere&s;t of the growers of wool, though it mu&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="37">
have been hurt in &s;ome degree, &s;eems, upon the whole, to have been much le&s;s hurt than could well have been imagined.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, however, will not ju&s;tify the ab&s;olute pro|hibition of the exportation of the wool. But they will fully ju&s;tify the impo&s;ition of a con&s;iderable tax upon that exportation.</P>
<P>TO hurt in any degree the intere&s;t of any one order of citizens, for no other purpo&s;e but to promote that of &s;ome other, is evidently contrary to that ju&s;tice and equality of treatment which the &s;overeign owes to all the different orders of his &s;ubjects. But the prohibi|tion certainly hurts, in &s;ome degree, the intere&s;t of the growers of wool, for no other purpo&s;e but to promote that of the manufac|turers.</P>
<P>EVERY different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the &s;upport of the &s;overeign or commonwealth. A tax of five, or even of ten &s;hillings upon the exportation of every tod of wool, would produce a very con&s;iderable revenue to the &s;overeign. It would hurt the intere&s;t of the growers &s;omewhat le&s;s than the prohibition, be|cau&s;e it would not probably lower the price of wool quite &s;o much. It would afford a &s;ufficient advantage to the manufacturer, becau&s;e, though he might not buy his wool altogether &s;o cheap as under the prohibition, he would &s;till buy it, at lea&s;t, five or ten &s;hillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it, be&s;ides &s;aving the freight and in&s;urance, which the other would be obliged to pay. It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to devi&s;e a tax which could produce any con&s;iderable revenue to the &s;overeign, and at the &s;ame time occa&s;ion &s;o little in|conveniency to any body.</P>
<P>THE prohibition, notwith&s;tanding all the penalties which guard it, does not prevent the exportation of wool. It is exported, it is well known, in great quantities. The great difference between the price in the home and that in the foreign market, pre&s;ents &s;uch a temptation to &s;muggling, that all the rigour of the law cannot pre|vent it. This illegal exportation is advantageous to no body but the
<PB N="38" REF="38">
&s;muggler. A legal exportation &s;ubject to a tax, by affording a re|venue to the &s;overeign, and thereby &s;aving the impo&s;ition of &s;ome other, perhaps more burden&s;ome and inconvenient taxes, might prove advantageous to all the different &s;ubjects of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE exportation of fuller's earth, or fuller's clay, &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary for preparing and clean&s;ing the woollen manufactures, has been &s;ubjected to nearly the &s;ame penalties as the exportation of wool. Even tobacco-pipe clay, though acknowledged to be dif|ferent from fuller's clay, yet, on account of their re&s;emblance, and becau&s;e fuller's clay might &s;ometimes be exported as tobacco-pipe clay, has been laid under the &s;ame prohibitions and penalties.</P>
<P>BY the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 7. the exportation, not only of raw hides, but of tanned leather, except in the &s;hape of boots, &s;hoes, or &s;lippers, was prohibited; and the law gave a mo|nopoly to our boot-makers and &s;hoe-makers, not only again&s;t our graziers, but again&s;t our tanners. By &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes our tanners have got them&s;elves exempted from this monopoly, upon paying a &s;mall tax of only one &s;hilling on the hundred weight of tanned leather, weighing one hundred and twelve pounds. They have ob|tained likewi&s;e the drawback of two thirds of the exci&s;e duties im|po&s;ed upon their commodity, even when exported without further manufacture. All manufactures of leather may be exported duty free; and the exporter is be&s;ides entitled to the drawback of the whole duties of exci&s;e. Our graziers &s;till continue &s;ubject to the old monopoly. Graziers &s;eparated from one another, and di&s;per&s;ed through all the different corners of the country, cannot, without great difficulty, combine together for the purpo&s;e either of im|po&s;ing monopolies upon their fellow-citizens, or of exempting them&s;elves from &s;uch, as may have been impo&s;ed upon them by other people. Manufacturers of all kinds, collected together in nu|merous bodies in all great cities, ea&s;ily can. Even the horns of cattle are prohibited to be exported; and the two in&s;ignificant trades
<PB N="39" REF="39">
of the horner and comb-maker enjoy, in this re&s;pect, a monopoly again&s;t the graziers.</P>
<P>RESTRAINTS, either by prohibitions or by taxes, upon the export|ation of goods which are partially, but not completely manufactured, are not peculiar to the manufacture of leather. As long as any thing remains to be done, in order to fit any commodity for imme|diate u&s;e and con&s;umption, our manufacturers think that they them|&s;elves ought to have the doing of it. Woollen yarn and wor&s;ted are prohibited to be exported under the &s;ame penalties as wool. Even white cloths are &s;ubject to a duty upon exportation, and our dyers have &s;o far obtained a monopoly again&s;t our clothiers. Our clothiers would probably have been able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t it, but it happens that the greater part of our principal clothiers are them&s;elves likewi&s;e dyers. Watch-ca&s;es, clock-ca&s;es, and dial-plates for clocks and watches, have been prohibited to be exported. Our clock-makers and watch-makers are, it &s;eems, unwilling that the price of this &s;ort of workman&s;hip &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon them by the com|petition of foreigners.</P>
<P>BY &s;ome old &s;tatutes of Edward III., Henry VIII., and Edward VI., the exportation of all metals was prohibited. Lead and tin were alone excepted; probably on account of the great abundance of tho&s;e metals; in the exportation of which, a con&s;iderable part of the trade of the kingdom in tho&s;e days con&s;i&s;ted. For the encou|ragement of the mining trade, the 5th of William and Mary, chap. 17., exempted from this prohibition iron, copper, and mundic metal made from Briti&s;h ore. The exportation of all &s;orts of copper bars, foreign as well as Briti&s;h, was afterwards permitted by the 9th and 10th of William III., chap. 26. The exportation of un|manufactured bra&s;s, of what is called gun-metal, bell-metal, and &s;hroff-metal, &s;till continues to be prohibited. Bra&s;s manufactures of all &s;orts may be exported duty free.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">
THE exportation of the materials of manufacture, where it is not altogether prohibited, is in many ca&s;es &s;ubjected to con&s;iderable duties.</P>
<P>BY the 8th George I., chap. 15., the exportation of all goods, the produce or manufacture of Great Britain, upon which any duties had been impo&s;ed by former &s;tatutes, was rendered duty free. The following goods, however, were excepted: Allum, lead, lead ore, tin, tanned leather, copperas, coals, wool cards, white woollen cloths, lapis calaminaris, &s;kins of all &s;orts, glue, coney hair or wool, hares wool, hair of all &s;orts, hor&s;es, and litharge of lead. If you except hor&s;es, all the&s;e are either materials of manufacture, or incomplete manufactures (which may be con&s;idered as materials for &s;till further manufacture), or in&s;truments of trade. This &s;tatute leaves them &s;ubject to all the old duties which had ever been impo&s;ed upon them, the old &s;ub&s;idy and one per cent. outwards.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame &s;tatute a great number of foreign drugs for dyers u&s;e, are exempted from all duties upon importation. Each of them, however, is afterwards &s;ubjected to a certain duty, not indeed a very heavy one, upon exportation. Our dyers, it &s;eems, while they thought it for their intere&s;t to encourage the importation of tho&s;e drugs, by an exemption from all duties, thought it likewi&s;e for their intere&s;t to throw &s;ome &s;mall di&s;couragement upon their ex|portation. The avidity, however, which &s;ugge&s;ted this notable piece of mercantile ingenuity, mo&s;t probably di&s;appointed it&s;elf of its object. It nece&s;&s;arily taught the importers to be more careful than they might otherwi&s;e have been, that their importation &s;hould not exceed what was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of the home market. The home market was at all times likely to be more &s;cantily &s;up|plied; the commodities were at all times likely to be &s;omewhat dearer there than they would have been, had the exportation been rendered as free as the importation.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="41">
BY the above-mentioned &s;tatute, gum &s;enega, or gum arabic, being among the enumerated dying drugs, might be imported duty free. They were &s;ubjected, indeed, to a &s;mall poundage duty, amounting only to three pence in the hundred weight upon their re-exportation. France enjoyed, at that time, an exclu&s;ive trade to the country mo&s;t productive of tho&s;e drugs, that which lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal; and the Briti&s;h market could not ea&s;ily be &s;upplied by the immediate importation of them from the place of growth. By the 25th Geo. II. therefore, gum &s;enega was allowed to be imported (contrary to the general di&s;po&s;itions of the act of navigation) from any part of Europe. As the law, however, did not mean to encourage this &s;pecies of trade, &s;o contrary to the ge|neral principles of the mercantile policy of England, it impo&s;ed a duty of ten &s;hillings the hundred weight upon &s;uch importation, and no part of this duty was to be afterwards drawn back upon its ex|portation. The &s;ucce&s;sful war which began in 1755 gave Great Britain the &s;ame exclu&s;ive trade to tho&s;e countries which France had enjoyed before. Our manufacturers, as &s;oon as the peace was made, endeavoured to avail them&s;elves of this advantage, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a monopoly in their own favour, both again&s;t the growers, and again&s;t the importers of this commodity. By the 5th Geo. III. therefore, chap. 37. the exportation of gum &s;enega from his ma|je&s;ty's dominions in Africa was confined to Great Britain, and was &s;ubjected to all the &s;ame re&s;trictions, regulations, forfeitures and pe|nalties, as that of the enumerated commodities of the Briti&s;h colonies in America and the We&s;t Indies. Its importation, indeed, was &s;ub|jected to a &s;mall duty of &s;ixpence the hundred weight, but its re|exportation was &s;ubjected to the enormous duty of one pound ten &s;hillings the hundred weight. It was the intention of our manu|facturers that the whole produce of tho&s;e countries &s;hould be im|ported into Great Britain, and in order that they them&s;elves might be enabled to buy it at their own price, that no part of it &s;hould be
<PB N="42" REF="42">
exported again, but at &s;uch an expence as would &s;ufficiently di&s;|courage that exportation. Their avidity, however, upon this, as well as upon many other occa&s;ions, di&s;appointed it&s;elf of its object. This enormous duty pre&s;ented &s;uch a temptation to &s;muggling, that great quantities of this commodity were clande&s;tinely exported pro|bably to all the manufacturing countries of Europe, but particularly to Holland, not only from Great Britain but from Africa. Upon this account, by the 14 Geo. III. chap. 10. this duty upon export|ation was reduced to five &s;hillings the hundred weight.</P>
<P>IN the book of rates, according to which the old &s;ub&s;idy was levied, beaver &s;kins were e&s;timated at &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence a piece, and the different &s;ub&s;idies and impo&s;ts, which before the year 1722 had been laid upon their importation, amounted to one-fifth part of the rate, or to &s;ixteen pence upon each &s;kin; all of which, except half the old &s;ub&s;idy, amounting only to two pence, was drawn back upon exportation. This duty upon the importation of &s;o im|portant a material of manufacture had been thought too high, and, in the year 1722, the rate was reduced to two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, which reduced the duty upon importation to &s;ixpence, and of this only one half was to be drawn back upon exportation. The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;sful war put the country mo&s;t productive of beaver under the dominion of Great Britain, and beaver &s;kins being among the enu|merated commodities, their exportation from America was con&s;e|quently confined to the market of Great Britain. Our manu|facturers &s;oon bethought them&s;elves of the advantage which they might make of this circum&s;tance, and in the year 1764, the duty upon the importation of beaver-&s;kin was reduced to one penny, but the duty upon exportation was rai&s;ed to &s;even pence each &s;kin, without any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the &s;ame law, a duty of eighteen pence the pound was impo&s;ed upon the ex|portation of beaver-wool or wombs, without making any alteration in the duty upon the importation of that commodity, which, when
<PB N="43" REF="43">
imported by Briti&s;h and in Briti&s;h &s;hipping, amounted at that time to between four pence and five pence the piece.</P>
<P>COALS may be con&s;idered both as a material of manufacture and as an in&s;trument of trade. Heavy duties, accordingly, have been impo&s;ed upon their exportation, amounting at pre&s;ent (1783) to more than five &s;hillings the ton, or to more than fifteen &s;hillings the chaldron, Newca&s;tle mea&s;ure; which is in mo&s;t ca&s;es more than the original value of the commodity at the coal pit, or even at the &s;hip|ping port for exportation.</P>
<P>THE exportation, however, of the in&s;truments of trade, properly &s;o called, is commonly re&s;trained, not by high duties, but by ab&s;olute prohibitions. Thus by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 20. &s;ect. 8. the exportation of frames or engines for knitting gloves or &s;tockings is prohibited under the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of &s;uch frames or engines, &s;o exported, or attempted to be exported, but of forty pounds, one half to the king, the other to the per&s;on who &s;hall inform or &s;ue for the &s;ame. In the &s;ame manner, by the 14th Geo. III. chap. 71. the exportation to foreign parts, of any uten&s;ils made u&s;e of in the cotton, linen, woollen and &s;lik manu|factures, is prohibited under the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of &s;uch uten&s;ils, but of two hundred pounds, to be paid by the per|&s;on who &s;hall offend in this manner, and likewi&s;e of two hundred pounds to be paid by the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip who &s;hall knowingly &s;uffer &s;uch uten&s;ils to be loaded on board his &s;hip.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch heavy penalties were impo&s;ed upon the exportation of the dead in&s;truments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living in&s;trument, the artificer, &s;hould be allowed to go free. Accord|ingly, by the 5 Geo. I. chap. 27. the per&s;on who &s;hall be convicted of enticing any artificer of, or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go into any foreign parts in order to practi&s;e or teach his trade, is liable for the fir&s;t offence to be &s;ined in any &s;um not exceeding one hundred pounds, and to three months impri&s;onment, and until the
<PB N="44" REF="44">
fine &s;hall be paid; and for the &s;econd offence, to be fined in any &s;um at the di&s;cretion of the court, and to impri&s;onment for twelve months, and until the fine &s;hall be paid. By the 23 Geo. II. chap. 13. this penalty is increa&s;ed for the fir&s;t offence to five hundred pounds for every artificer &s;o enticed, and to twelve months impri&s;onment, and until the fine &s;hall be paid; and for the &s;econd offence, to one thou&s;and pounds, and to two years impri&s;onment, and until the fine &s;hall be paid.</P>
<P>BY the former of tho&s;e two &s;tatutes, upon proof that any per&s;on has been enticing any artificer, or that any artificer has promi&s;ed or contracted to go into foreign parts for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, &s;uch artificers may be obliged to give &s;ecurity, at the di&s;cretion of the court, that he &s;hall not go beyond the &s;eas, and may be committed to pri&s;on until he give &s;uch &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>IF any artificer has gone beyond the &s;eas, and is exerci&s;ing or teaching his trade in any foreign country, upon warning being given to him by any of his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters or con&s;uls abroad, or by one of his maje&s;ty's &s;ecretaries of &s;tate for the time being, if he does not, within &s;ix months after &s;uch warning, return into this realm, and from thenceforth abide and inhabit continually within the &s;ame, he is from thenceforth declared incapable of taking any legacy de|vi&s;ed to him within this kingdom, or of being executor or admi|ni&s;trator to any per&s;on, or of taking any lands within this kingdom by de&s;cent, devi&s;e, or purcha&s;e. He likewi&s;e forfeits to the king, all his lands, goods and chattels, is declared an alien in every re&s;pect, and is put out of the king's protection.</P>
<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary, I imagine, to ob&s;erve, how contrary &s;uch re|gulations are to the boa&s;ted liberty of the &s;ubject, of which we af|fect to be &s;o very jealous; but which, in this ca&s;e, is &s;o plainly &s;acri|ficed to the futile intere&s;ts of our merchants and manufacturers.</P>
<P>THE laudable motive of all the&s;e regulations, is to extend our own manufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the de|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="45" REF="45">
of tho&s;e of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the trouble&s;ome competition of &s;uch odious and di&s;agreeable rivals. Our ma&s;ter manufacturers think it rea&s;onable, that they them&s;elves &s;hould have the monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen. Though by re&s;training, in &s;ome trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at one time, and by impo&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ity of a long apprentice&s;hip in all trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their re&s;pective employments to as &s;mall a number as po&s;&s;ible; they are unwilling, however, that any part of this &s;mall number &s;hould go abroad to in|&s;truct foreigners.</P>
<P>CONSUMPTION is the &s;ole end and purpo&s;e of all production; and the intere&s;t of the producer ought to be attended to, only &s;o far as it may be nece&s;&s;ary for promoting that of the con&s;umer. The maxim is &s;o perfectly &s;elf-evident, that it would be ab&s;urd to attempt to prove it. But in the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, the intere&s;t of the con|&s;umer is almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;acrificed to that of the producer; and it &s;eems to con&s;ider production, and not con&s;umption, as the ultimate end and object of all indu&s;try and commerce.</P>
<P>IN the re&s;traints upon the importation of all foreign commodities which can come into competition with tho&s;e of our own growth, or manufacture, the intere&s;t of the home-con&s;umer is evidently &s;a|crificed to that of the producer. It is altogether for the benefit of the latter, that the former is obliged to pay that enhancement of price which this monopoly almo&s;t always occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT is altogether for the benefit of the producer that bounties are granted upon the exportation of &s;ome of his productions. The home-con&s;umer is obliged to pay, fir&s;t, the tax which is nece&s;&s;ary for paying the bounty, and &s;econdly, the &s;till greater tax which ne|ce&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from the enhancement of the price of the commodity in the home market.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46">
BY the famous treaty of commerce with Portugal, the con&s;umer is prevented by high duties from purcha&s;ing of a neighbouring country, a commodity which our own climate does not produce, but is obliged to purcha&s;e it of a di&s;tant country, though it is ac|knowledged that the commodity of the di&s;tant country is of a wor&s;e quality than that of the near one. The home-con&s;umer is obliged to &s;ubmit to this inconveniency, in order that the producer may import into the di&s;tant country &s;ome of his productions upon more advantageous terms than he would otherwi&s;e have been allowed to do. The con&s;umer, too, is obliged to pay, whatever enhancement in the price of tho&s;e very productions, this forced exportation may occa&s;ion in the home-market.</P>
<P>BUT in the &s;y&s;tem of laws which has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the management of our American and We&s;t Indian colonies, the intere&s;t of the home-con&s;umer has been &s;acrificed to that of the producer with a more extravagant profu&s;ion than in all our other commercial regulations. A great empire has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of rai&s;ing up a nation of cu&s;tomers who &s;hould be obliged to buy from the &s;hops of our different producers, all the goods with which the&s;e could &s;upply them. For the &s;ake of that little enhance|ment of price which this monopoly might afford our producers, the home-con&s;umers have been burdened with the whole expence of maintaining and defending that empire. For this purpo&s;e, and for this purpo&s;e only, in the two la&s;t wars, more than two hundred millions have been &s;pent, and a new debt of more than a hundred and &s;eventy millions has been contracted over and above all that had been expended for the &s;ame purpo&s;e in former wars. The intere&s;t of this debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit, which, it ever could be pretended, was made by the monopoly of the colony trade, but than the whole value of that trade, or than the whole value of the goods, which at an average have been annually exported to the colonies.</P>

IT cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole mercantile &s;y&s;tem; not the con&s;umers, we may believe, who&s;e intere&s;t has been entirely neglected; but the pro|ducers, who&s;e intere&s;t has been &s;o carefully attended to; and among this latter cla&s;s our merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects. In the mercantile regulations, which have been taken notice of in this chapter, the intere&s;t of our manufac|turers has been mo&s;t peculiarly attended to; and the intere&s;t, not &s;o much of the con&s;umers, as that of &s;ome other &s;ets of producers, has been &s;acrificed to it.</P>

<P><HI>Of the Publick Works and In&s;titutions which are nece&s;&s;ary for facilitat|ing particular Branches of Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>THE object of the publick works and in&s;titutions above men|tioned is to facilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate &s;ome particular branches of it, particular in&s;titutions are nece&s;&s;ary, which again require a particular and extraordinary ex|pence.</P>
<P>SOME particular branches of commerce, which are carried on with barbarous and uncivilized nations, require extraordinary protection. An ordinary &s;tore or counting-hou&s;e could give little &s;ecurity to the goods of the merchants who trade to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa. To defend them from the barbarous natives, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the place where they are depo&s;ited, &s;hould be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, forti|fied. The di&s;orders in the government of Indo&s;tan have been &s;up|po&s;ed to render a like precaution nece&s;&s;ary even among that mild and gentle people; and it was under pretence of &s;ecuring their per&s;ons and property from violence, that both the Engli&s;h and
<PB N="48" REF="48">
French Ea&s;t India Companies were allowed to erect the fir&s;t forts which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that country. Among other nations, who&s;e vigorous government will &s;uffer no &s;trangers to po&s;&s;e&s;s any fortified place within their territory, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to maintain &s;ome amba&s;&s;ador, mini&s;ter, or con&s;ul, who may both decide, according to their own cu&s;toms, the differences ari&s;ing among his own coun|trymen; and, in their di&s;putes with the natives, may, by means of his publick character, interfere with more authority, and afford them a more powerful protection, than they could expect from any private man. The intere&s;ts of commerce have frequently made it nece&s;&s;ary to maintain mini&s;ters in foreign countries, where the purpo&s;es, either of war or alliance, would not have required any. The commerce of the Turkey company fir&s;t occa&s;ioned the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ordinary amba&s;&s;ador at Con&s;tantinople. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ies to Ru&s;&s;ia aro&s;e altogether from commercial intere&s;ts. The con&s;tant interference which tho&s;e intere&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned between the &s;ubjects of the different &s;tates of Europe, has probably introduced the cu&s;tom of keeping, in all neighbouring countries, amba&s;&s;adors or mini&s;ters con&s;tantly re&s;ident even in the time of peace. This cu&s;tom, unknown to ancient times, &s;eems not to be older than the end of the fifteenth, or beginning of the &s;ixteenth century; that is, than the time when commerce fir&s;t began to extend it&s;elf to the greater part of the na|tions of Europe, and when they fir&s;t began to attend to its in|tere&s;ts.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems not unrea&s;onable, that the extraordinary expence, which the protection of any particular branch of commerce may occa&s;ion, &s;hould be defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate fine, for example, to be paid by the traders when they fir&s;t enter into it, or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of &s;o much per cent. upon the goods which they either import into, or export out of, the particular countries with which it is carried on. The protection of trade in general, from pirates and freebooters, is
<PB N="49" REF="49">
&s;aid to have given occa&s;ion to the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the duties of cu&s;toms. But, if it was thought rea&s;onable to lay a general tax upon trade, in order to defray the expence of protecting trade in general, it &s;hould &s;eem equally rea&s;onable to lay a particular tax upon a particular branch of trade, in order to defray the extraordinary expence of protecting that branch.</P>
<P>THE protection of trade in general has always been con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to the defence of the commonwealth; and, upon that ac|count, a nece&s;&s;ary part of the duty of the executive power. The collection and application of the general duties of cu&s;toms, therefore, have always been left to that power. But the protection of any particular branch of trade is a part of the general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the duty of that power; and if nations always acted con&s;i&s;tently, the particular duties levied for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch particular protection, &s;hould always have been left equally to its di&s;|po&s;al. But in this re&s;pect, as well as in many others, nations have not always acted con&s;i&s;tently; and in the greater part of the com|mercial &s;tates of Europe, particular companies of merchants have had the addre&s;s to per&s;wade the legi&s;lature to entru&s;t to them the performance of this part of the duty of the &s;overeign, together with all the powers which are nece&s;&s;arily connected with it.</P>
<P>THESE companies, though they may, perhaps, have been u&s;eful for the fir&s;t introduction of &s;ome branches of commerce, by making, at their own expence, an experiment which the &s;tate might not think it prudent to make, have in the long-run proved, univer&s;ally, either burden&s;ome or u&s;ele&s;s, and have either mi&s;managed or con|fined the trade.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e companies do not trade upon a joint &s;tock, but are obliged to admit any per&s;on, properly qualified, upon paying a cer|tain fine, and agreeing to &s;ubmit to the regulations of the company, each member trading upon his own &s;tock, and at his own ri&s;k, they are called regulated companies. When they trade upon a joint &s;tock,
<PB N="50" REF="50">
each member &s;haring in the common profit or lo&s;s in proportion to his &s;hare in this &s;tock, they are called joint &s;tock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or joint &s;tock, &s;ometimes have, and &s;ometimes have not, exclu&s;ive privileges.</P>
<P>REGULATED companies re&s;emble, in every re&s;pect, the corpora|tions of trades, &s;o common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of Europe; and are a &s;ort of enlarged monopolies of the &s;ame kind. As no inhabitant of a town can exerci&s;e an incorporated trade, without fir&s;t obtaining his freedom in the corporation, &s;o in mo&s;t ca&s;es no &s;ubject of the &s;tate can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which a regulated company is e&s;tabli&s;hed, with|out fir&s;t becoming a member of that company. The monopoly is more or le&s;s &s;trict according as the terms of admi&s;&s;ion are more or le&s;s difficult; and according as the directors of the company have more or le&s;s authority, or have it more or le&s;s in their power to manage, in &s;uch a manner as to confine the greater part of the trade to them&s;elves, and their particular friends. In the mo&s;t ancient re|gulated companies the privileges of apprentice&s;hip were the &s;ame as in other corporations; and intitled the per&s;on who had &s;erved his time to a member of the company, to become him&s;elf a member, either without paying any fine, or upon paying a much &s;maller one than what was exacted of other people. The u&s;ual corporation &s;pirit, wherever the law does not re&s;train it, prevails in all regulated com|panies. When they have been allowed to act according to their na|tural genius, they have always, in order to confine the competition to as &s;mall a number of per&s;ons as po&s;&s;ible, endeavoured to &s;ubject the trade to many burden&s;ome regulations. When the law has re|&s;trained them from doing this, they have become altogether u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>THE regulated companies for foreign commerce, which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Great Britain, are, the ancient merchant adventurers com|pany, now commonly called the Hamburgh Company, the Ru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="51" REF="51">
Company, the Ea&s;tland Company, the Turky Company, and the African Company.</P>
<P>THE terms of admi&s;&s;ion into the Hamburgh Company, are now &s;aid to be quite ea&s;y; and the directors either have it not in their power to &s;ubject the trade to any burden&s;ome re&s;traints or regula|tions, or, at lea&s;t, have not of late exerci&s;ed that power. It has not always been &s;o. About the middle of the la&s;t century, the fine for admi&s;&s;ion was fifty, and at one time one hundred pounds, and the conduct of the company was &s;aid to be extremely oppre&s;&s;ive. In 1643, in 1645, and in 1661, the clothiers and free traders of the We&s;t of England complained of them to parliament, as of mono|poli&s;ts who confined the trade and oppre&s;&s;ed the manufactures of the country. Though tho&s;e complaints produced no act of parlia|ment, they had probably intimidated the company &s;o far, as to oblige them to reform their conduct. Since that time, at lea&s;t, there has been no complaints again&s;t them. By the 10th and 11th of William III. c. 6. the fine for admi&s;&s;ion into the Ru&s;&s;ian Company was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of Charles II. c. 7. that for admi&s;&s;ion into the Ea&s;tland Company, to forty &s;hillings, while, at the &s;ame time, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, all the countries on the north-&s;ide of the Baltick, were exempted from their exclu&s;ive charter. The conduct of tho&s;e companies had probably given occa&s;ion to tho&s;e two acts of parliament. Before that time, Sir Jo&s;iah Child had repre&s;ented both the&s;e and the Hamburgh Com|pany as extremely oppre&s;&s;ive, and imputed to their bad management the low &s;tate of the trade, which we at that time carried on to the countries comprehended within their re&s;pective charters. But though &s;uch companies may not, in the pre&s;ent times, be very oppre&s;&s;ive, they are certainly altogether u&s;ele&s;s. To be merely u&s;ele&s;s, indeed, is perhaps the highe&s;t eulogy which can ever ju&s;tly be be&s;towed upon a regulated company; and all the three companies above mentioned &s;eem, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, to de&s;erve this eulogy.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="52">
THE fine for admi&s;&s;ion into the Turky Company, was formerly twenty-five pounds for all per&s;ons under twenty-&s;ix years of age, and fifty pounds for all per&s;ons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be admitted; a re&s;triction which excluded all &s;hop|keepers and retailers. By a bye-law, no Briti&s;h manufactures could be exported to Turky but in the general &s;hips of the company; and as tho&s;e &s;hips &s;ailed always from the port of London, this re&s;triction confined the trade to that exten&s;ive port, and the traders, to tho&s;e who lived in London and in its neighbourhood. By another bye-law, no per&s;on living within twenty miles of London, and not free of the city, could be admitted a member; another re&s;triction, which, joined to the foregoing, nece&s;&s;arily excluded all but the freemen of London. As the time for the loading and &s;ailing of tho&s;e general &s;hips depended altogether upon the directors, they could ea&s;ily fill them with their own goods and tho&s;e of their particular friends, to the exclu&s;ion of others, who, they might pretend, had made their propo&s;als too late. In this &s;tate of things, therefore, this company was in every re&s;pect a &s;trict and oppre&s;&s;ive monopoly. Tho&s;e abu&s;es gave occa&s;ion to the act of the 26th of Geo. II. c. 18. reducing the fine for admi&s;&s;ion to twenty pounds for all per&s;ons, without any di&s;tinction of ages, or any re&s;triction, either to mere merchants, or to the freemen of London; and granting to all &s;uch per&s;ons the liberty of exporting, from all the ports of Great Britain to any port in Turky, all Briti&s;h goods of which the exportation was not prohibited; and of importing from thence all Turki&s;h goods, of which the importation was not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of cu&s;toms, and the particular duties a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for defraying the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the company; and &s;ubmitting, at the &s;ame time, to the lawful authority of the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador and con&s;uls re&s;ident in Turky, and to the bye-laws of the company duly enacted. To prevent any oppre&s;&s;ion by tho&s;e bye-laws, it was by the &s;ame act ordained, that if any &s;even members of the company conceived them&s;elves aggrieved
<PB N="53" REF="53">
by any bye-law which &s;hould be enacted after the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, they might appeal to the Board of Trade and Plantations (to the autho|rity of which, a committee of the privy council has now &s;ucceeded), provided &s;uch appeal was brought within twelve months after the bye-law was enacted; and that if any &s;even members conceived them&s;elves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been enacted be|fore the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, they might bring a like appeal, provided it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was to take place. The experience of one year, however, may not always be &s;ufficient to di&s;cover to all the members of a great company the pernicious tendency of a particular bye-law; and if &s;everal of them &s;hould afterwards di&s;cover it, neither the Board of Trade, nor the Committee of Council, can afford them any redre&s;s. The object, be|&s;ides, of the greater part of the bye-laws of all regulated companies, as well as of all other corporations, is not &s;o much to oppre&s;s tho&s;e who are already members, as to di&s;courage others from becoming &s;o; which may be done, not only by a high fine, but by many other contrivances. The con&s;tant view of &s;uch companies is always to rai&s;e the rate of their own profit as high as they can; to keep the market, both for the goods which they export, and for tho&s;e which they import, as much under&s;tocked as they can: which can be done only by re&s;training the competition, or by di&s;couraging new adventurers from entering into the trade. A fine even of twenty pounds, be|&s;ides, though it may not, perhaps, be &s;ufficient to di&s;courage any man from entering into the Turky trade, with an intention to continue in it, may be enough to di&s;courage a &s;peculative merchant from ha|zarding a &s;ingle adventure in it. In all trades, the regular e&s;tabli&s;h|ed traders, even though not incorporated, naturally combine to rai&s;e profits, which are noway &s;o likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper level, as by the occa&s;ional competition of &s;peculative adventurers. The Turky trade, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure laid open by this act of parliament, is &s;till con&s;idered by many people as very
<PB N="54" REF="54">
far from being altogether free. The Turky company contribute to maintain an amba&s;&s;ador and two or three con&s;uls, who, like other publick mini&s;ters, ought to be maintained altogether by the &s;tate, and the trade laid open to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other corporation purpo&s;es, might afford a revenue much more than &s;ufficient to enable the &s;tate to maintain &s;uch mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>REGULATED companies, it was ob&s;erved by Sir Jo&s;iah Child, though they had frequently &s;upported publick mini&s;ters, had never maintained any forts or garri&s;ons in the countries to which they traded; whereas joint &s;tock companies frequently had. And in reality the former &s;eem to be much more unfit for this &s;ort of &s;ervice than the latter. Fir&s;t, the directors of a regulated company have no particular intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the general trade of the company, for the &s;ake of which, &s;uch forts and garri&s;ons are maintained. The decay of that general trade may even frequently contribute to the advantage of their own private trade; as by dimi|ni&s;hing the number of their competitors, it may enable them both to buy cheaper, and to &s;ell dearer. The directors of a joint &s;tock company, on the contrary, having only their &s;hare in the profits which are made upon the common &s;tock committed to their management, have no private trade of their own, of which the intere&s;t can be &s;eparated from that of the general trade of the company. Their private intere&s;t is connected with the pro&s;perity of the general trade of the company; and with the maintenance of the forts and garri|&s;ons, which are nece&s;&s;ary for its defence. They are more likely, therefore, to have that continual and careful attention which that maintenance nece&s;&s;arily requires. Secondly, The directors of a joint &s;tock company have always the management of a large capital, the joint &s;tock of the company, a part of which they may frequently employ, with propriety, in building, repairing, and maintaining &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary forts and garri&s;ons. But the directors of a regulated
<PB N="55" REF="55">
company, having the management of no common capital, have no other fund to employ in this way, but the ca&s;ual revenue ari&s;ing from the admi&s;&s;ion fines, and from the corporation duties, impo&s;ed upon the trade of the company. Though they had the &s;ame in|tere&s;t, therefore, to attend to the maintenance of &s;uch forts and garri&s;ons, they can &s;eldom have the &s;ame ability to render that at|tention effectual. The maintenance of a publick mini&s;ter requiring &s;carce any attention, and but a moderate and limited expence, is a bu&s;ine&s;s much more &s;uitable both to the temper and abilities of a regulated company.</P>
<P>LONG after the time of Sir Jo&s;iah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated company was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the pre&s;ent company of mer|chants trading to Africa, which was expre&s;sly charged at fir&s;t with the maintenance of all the Briti&s;h forts and garri&s;ons that lie between Cape Blanc and the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards with that of tho&s;e only which lie between Cape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which e&s;tabli&s;hes this company (the 23d of George II. c. 31.) &s;eems to have had two di&s;tinct objects in view; fir&s;t, to re&s;train effectually the oppre&s;&s;ive and monopolizing &s;pirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated company; and &s;econdly, to force them, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to give an attention, which is not natural to them, towards the maintenance of forts and gar|ri&s;ons.</P>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es, the fine for admi&s;&s;ion is limited to forty &s;hillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate capacity, or upon a joint &s;tock; from borrowing money upon common &s;eal, or from laying any re&s;traints upon the trade, which may be carried on freely from all places, and by all per&s;ons being Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and paying the fine. The government is in a committee of nine per&s;ons who meet at London, but who are cho&s;en annually by the freemen of the company at London, Bri&s;tol, and Liverpool; three from each place. No committee-man can be
<PB N="56" REF="56">
continued in office for more than three years together. Any com|mittee-man might be removed by the Board of Trade and Plantations; now by a committee of council, after being heard in his own de|fence. The committee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to import any African goods into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the maintenance of forts and garri&s;ons, they may, for that purpo&s;e, export from Great Britain to Africa, goods and &s;tores of different kinds. Out of the monies which they &s;hall receive from the company, they are allowed a &s;um not exceeding eight hundred pounds for the &s;alaries of their clerks and agents at London, Bri&s;tol, and Liverpool, the hou&s;e-rent of their office at London, and all the other expences of management, commi&s;&s;ion and agency in Eng|land. What remains of this &s;um, after defraying the&s;e different expences, they may divide among them&s;elves, as compen&s;ation for their trouble, in what manner they think proper. By this con&s;ti|tution it might have been expected, that the &s;pirit of monopoly would have been effectually re&s;trained, and the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es &s;ufficiently an&s;wered. It would &s;eem, however, that it had not. Though by the 4th of George III. c. 20. the fort of Senegal, with all its dependencies, had been ve&s;ted in the company of merchants trading to Africa, yet in the year following (by the 5th of Geo. III. c. 44.), not only Senegal and its dependencies, but the whole coa&s;t, from the port of Sallee, in South Barbary, to Cape Rouge, was ex|empted from the juri&s;diction of that company, was ve&s;ted in the crown, and the trade to it declared free to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. The company had been &s;u&s;pected of re&s;training the trade, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome &s;ort of improper monopoly. It is not, however, very ea&s;y to conceive how, under the regulations of the 23d Geo. II. they could do &s;o. In the printed debates of the Hou&s;e of Commons, not always the mo&s;t authentic records of truth, I ob&s;erve, however, that they have been accu&s;ed of this. The members of the committee of nine, being all merchants, and the governors and factors, in their
<PB N="57" REF="57">
different forts and &s;ettlements, being all dependent upon them, it is not unlikely that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the con&s;ignments and commi&s;&s;ions of the former, which would e&s;ta|bli&s;h a real monopoly.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;econd of the&s;e purpo&s;es, the maintenance of the forts and garri&s;ons, an annual &s;um has been allotted to them by parliament, generally about 13,000<HI>l.</HI> For the proper application of this &s;um, the committee is obliged to account annually to the Cur&s;itor Baron of Exchequer; which account is afterwards to be laid before parliament. But parliament, which gives &s;o little attention to the application of millions, is not likely to give much to that of 13,000<HI>l.</HI> a-year; and the Cur&s;itor Baron of Exchequer, from his profe&s;&s;ion and education, is not likely to be profoundly &s;killed in the proper expence of forts and garri&s;ons. The captains of his maje&s;ty's navy, indeed, or any other commi&s;&s;ioned officers, appointed by the Board of Admiralty, may enquire into the condition of the forts and garri&s;ons, and report their ob&s;ervations to that board. But that board &s;eems to have no direct juri&s;diction over the committee, nor any authority to correct tho&s;e who&s;e conduct it may thus enquire into; and the captains of his maje&s;ty's navy, be&s;ides, are not &s;up|po&s;ed to be always deeply learned in the &s;cience of fortification. Removal from an office, which can be enjoyed only for the term of three years, and of which the lawful emoluments, even during that term, are &s;o very &s;mall, &s;eems to be the utmo&s;t puni&s;hment to which any committee-man is liable, for any fault, except direct malver&s;a|tion, or embezzlement, either of the publick money, or of that of the company; and the fear of that puni&s;hment can never be a motive of &s;ufficient weight to force a continual and careful attention to a bu&s;ine&s;s, to which he has no other intere&s;t to attend. The committee are accu&s;ed of having &s;ent out bricks and &s;tones from England for the reparation of Cape Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle on the coa&s;t of Guinea, a bu&s;ine&s;s for which parliament had &s;everal times granted an extraordinary
<PB N="58" REF="58">
&s;um of money. The&s;e bricks and &s;tones too, which had thus been &s;ent upon &s;o long a voyage, were &s;aid to have been of &s;o bad a quality, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to rebuild from the foundation the walls which had been repaired with them. The forts and garri&s;ons which lie north of Cape Rouge, are not only maintained at the ex|pence of the &s;tate, but are under the immediate government of the executive power; and why tho&s;e which lie &s;outh of that Cape, and which too are, in part at lea&s;t, maintained at the expence of the &s;tate, &s;hould be under a different government, it &s;eems not very ea&s;y even to imagine a good rea&s;on. The protection of the Mediter|ranean trade was the original purpo&s;e or pretence of the garri&s;ons of Gibraltar and Minorca, and the maintenance and government of tho&s;e garri&s;ons has always been, very properly, committed, not to the Turky Company, but to the executive power. In the extent of its dominion con&s;i&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure, the pride and dignity of that power; and it is not very likely to fail in attention to what is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of that dominion. The garri&s;ons at Gibraltar and Minorca, accordingly, have never been neglected; though Minorca has been twice taken, and is now probably lo&s;t for ever, that di&s;a&s;ter was never even imputed to any neglect in the ex|ecutive power. I would not, however, be under&s;tood to in&s;inuate, that either of tho&s;e expen&s;ive garri&s;ons was ever, even in the &s;mall|e&s;t degree, nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e for which they were originally di&s;membered from the Spani&s;h monarchy. That di&s;memberment, perhaps, never &s;erved any other real purpo&s;e than to alienate from England her natural ally the king of Spain, and to unite the two principal branches of the hou&s;e of Bourbon in a much &s;tricter and more parmanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them.</P>
<P>JOINT &s;tock companies, e&s;tabli&s;hed either by royal charter or by act of parliament, differ in &s;everal re&s;pects, not only from regulated companies, but from private copartneries.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="59">
FIRST, In a private copartnery, no partner, without the con&s;ent of the company, can transfer his &s;hare to another per&s;on, or intro|duce a new member into the company. Each member, however, may, upon proper warning, withdraw from the copartnery, and de|mand payment from them of his &s;hare of the common &s;tock. In a joint &s;tock company, on the contrary, no member can demand pay|ment of his &s;hare from the company; but each member can, with|out their con&s;ent, transfer his &s;hare to another per&s;on, and thereby introduce a new member. The value of a &s;hare in a joint &s;tock is always the price which it will bring in the market; and this may be either greater or le&s;s, in any proportion, than the &s;um which its owner &s;tands credited for in the &s;tock of the company.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, In a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts contracted by the company to the whole extent of his for|tune. In a joint &s;tock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the extent of his &s;hare.</P>
<P>THE trade of a joint &s;tock company is always managed by a court of directors. This court, indeed, is frequently &s;ubject, in many re&s;pects, to the control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of tho&s;e proprietors &s;eldom pretend to under&s;tand any thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the company; and when the &s;pirit of faction happens not to prevail among them, give them&s;elves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly &s;uch half yearly or yearly dividend, as the directors think proper to make to them. This total exemption from trouble and from ri&s;k, beyond a limited &s;um, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint &s;tock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to them&s;elves much greater &s;tocks than any private copartnery can boa&s;t of. The trading &s;tock of the South Sea Company, at one time, amounted to upwards of thirty-three millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. The divided capital of the Bank of England amounts, at pre&s;ent, to
<PB N="60" REF="60">
ten millions &s;even hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds. The di|rectors of &s;uch companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they &s;hould watch over it with the &s;ame anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the &s;tewards of a rich man, they are apt to con&s;ider attention to &s;mall matters as not for their ma&s;ter's honour, and very ea&s;ily give them&s;elves a di&s;pen&s;ation from having it. Negligence and profu&s;ion, therefore, mu&s;t always prevail, more or le&s;s, in the management of the affairs of &s;uch a company. It is upon this ac|count that joint &s;tock companies for foreign trade have &s;eldom been able to maintain the competition again&s;t private adventurers. They have, accordingly, very &s;eldom &s;ucceeded without an exclu&s;ive pri|vilege; and frequently have not &s;ucceeded with one. Without an exclu&s;ive privilege they have commonly mi&s;managed the trade. With an exclu&s;ive privilege they have both mi&s;managed and con|fined it.</P>
<P>THE royal African Company, the predece&s;&s;ors of the pre&s;ent Afri|can Company, had an exclu&s;ive privilege by charter; but as that charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament, the trade, in con&s;equence of the declaration of rights, was, &s;oon after the Revo|lution, laid open to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. The Hud&s;on's Bay Company are, as to their legal rights, in the &s;ame &s;ituation as the Royal African Company. Their exclu&s;ive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament. The South Sea Company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an exclu&s;ive privilege confirmed by act of parliament; as have likewi&s;e the pre|&s;ent United Company of Merchants trading to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>THE Royal African Company &s;oon found that they could not maintain the competition again&s;t private adventurers, whom, not|with&s;tanding the declaration of rights, they continued for &s;ome time to call interlopers, and to per&s;ecute as &s;uch. In 1698, however,
<PB N="61" REF="61">
the private adventurers were &s;ubjected to a duty of ten per cent. upon almo&s;t all the different branches of their trade, to be employed by the company in the maintenance of their forts and garri&s;ons. But, notwith&s;tanding this heavy tax, the company were &s;till unable to maintain the competition. Their &s;tock and credit gradually de|clined. In 1712, their debts had become &s;o great, that a particular act of parliament was thought nece&s;&s;ary, both for their &s;ecurity and for that of their creditors. It was enacted, that the re&s;olution of two-thirds of the&s;e creditors in number and value, &s;hould bind the re&s;t, both with regard to the time which &s;hould be allowed to the company for the payment of their debts; and with regard to any other agreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concerning tho&s;e debts. In 1730, their affairs were in &s;o great di&s;order, that they were altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garri&s;ons, the &s;ole purpo&s;e and pretext of their in&s;titution. From that year, till their final di&s;&s;olution, the parliament judged it nece&s;&s;ary to allow the annual &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e. In 1732, after having been for many years lo&s;ers by the trade of carrying negroes to the We&s;t Indies, they at la&s;t re&s;olved to give it up altogether; to &s;ell to the private traders to America the negroes which they purcha&s;ed upon the coa&s;t; and to employ their &s;ervants in a trade to the inland parts of Africa for gold du&s;t, elephants teeth, dying drugs, &amp;c. But their &s;ucce&s;s in this more confined trade was not greater than in their former exten&s;ive one. Their affairs continued to go gradually to decline, till, at la&s;t, be|ing in every re&s;pect a bankrupt company, they were di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament, and their forts and garri&s;ons ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ent re|gulated company of merchants trading to Africa. Before the erection of the Royal African Company, there had been three other joint &s;tock companies &s;ucce&s;&s;ively e&s;tabli&s;hed, one after another, for the African trade. They were all equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. They all, how|ever, had exclu&s;ive charters, which, though not confirmed by act of
<PB N="62" REF="62">
parliament, were in tho&s;e days &s;uppo&s;ed to convey a real exclu&s;ive privilege.</P>
<P>THE Hud&s;on's Bay Company, before their misfortunes in the late war, had been much more fortunate than the Royal African Com|pany. Their nece&s;&s;ary expence is much &s;maller. The whole num|ber of people whom they maintain in their different &s;ettlements and habitations, which they have honoured with the name of forts, is &s;aid not to exceed a hundred and twenty per&s;ons. This number, however, is &s;ufficient to prepare before-hand the cargo of furs and other goods nece&s;&s;ary for loading their &s;hips, which, on account of the ice, can &s;eldom remain above &s;ix or eight weeks in tho&s;e &s;eas. This advantage of having a cargo ready prepared, could not for &s;e|veral years be acquired by private adventurers, and without it there &s;eems to be no po&s;&s;ibility of trading to Hud&s;on's Bay. The moderate capital of the company, which, it is &s;aid, does not exceed one hun|dred and ten thou&s;and pounds, may be&s;ides be &s;ufficient to enable them to engro&s;s the whole, or almo&s;t the whole, trade and &s;urplus produce of the mi&s;erable, though exten&s;ive country, comprehended within their charter. No private adventurers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in competition with them. This company, therefore, have always enjoyed an exclu&s;ive trade in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over and above all this, the moderate capital of this company is &s;aid to be divided among a very &s;mall number of proprietors. But a joint &s;tock com|pany, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall number of proprietors, with a moderate capital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a private copartnery, and may be capable of nearly the &s;ame degree of vigilance and atten|tion. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if, in con&s;equence of the&s;e different advantages, the Hud&s;on's Bay Company had, before the late war, been able to carry on their trade with a con&s;iderable degree of &s;ucce&s;s. It does not &s;eem probable, however, that their profits ever approached to what the late Mr. Dobbs imagined them.
<PB N="63" REF="63">
A much more &s;ober and judicious writer, Mr. Ander&s;on, author of the Hi&s;torical and Chronological Deduction of Commerce, very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that upon examining the accounts which Mr. Dobbs him|&s;elf has given for &s;everal years together, of their exports and imports, and upon making proper allowances for their extraordinary ri&s;k and expence, it does not appear that their profits de&s;erve to be envied, or that they can much, if at all, exceed the ordinary profits of trade.</P>
<P>THE South Sea Company never had any forts or garri&s;ons to maintain, and therefore were entirely exempted from one great ex|pence, to which other joint &s;tock companies for foreign trade are &s;ubject. But they had an immen&s;e capital divided among an im|men&s;e number of proprietors. It was naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and profu&s;ion &s;hould prevail in the whole management of their affairs. The knavery and extravagance of their &s;tock-jobbing projects are &s;ufficiently known, and the ex|plication of them would be foreign to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Their mercantile projects were not much better conducted. The fir&s;t trade which they engaged in was that of &s;upplying the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies with negroes, of which (in con&s;equence of what was called the A&s;&s;iento contract, granted them by the treaty of Utrecht) they had the exclu&s;ive privilege. But as it was not expected that much profit could be made by this trade, both the Portugueze and French companies, who had enjoyed it upon the &s;ame terms before them, having been ruined by it, they were allowed, as compen&s;ation, to &s;end annually a &s;hip of a certain burden to trade directly to the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies. Of the ten voyages which this annual &s;hip was allowed to make, they are &s;aid to have gained con&s;iderably by one, that of the Royal Caroline in 1731, and to have been lo&s;ers, more or le&s;s, by almo&s;t all the re&s;t. Their ill &s;ucce&s;s was imputed, by their factors and agents, to the extortion and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Spa|ni&s;h government; but was, perhaps, principally owing to the pro|fu&s;ion
<PB N="64" REF="64">
and depredations of tho&s;e very factors and agents; &s;ome of whom are &s;aid to have acquired great fortunes even in one year. In 1734, the company petitioned the king, that they might be al|lowed to di&s;po&s;e of the trade and tunnage of their annual &s;hip, on account of the little profit which they made by it, and to accept of &s;uch equivalent as they could obtain from the king of Spain.</P>
<P>IN 1724, this company had undertaken the whale-fi&s;hery. Of this, indeed, they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other Briti&s;h &s;ubjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which their &s;hips made to Greenland, they were gainers by one, and lo&s;ers by all the re&s;t. After their eighth and la&s;t voyage, when they had &s;old their &s;hips, &s;tores, and uten&s;ils, they found that their whole lo&s;s, upon this branch, capital and in|tere&s;t included, amounted to upwards of two hundred and thirty|&s;even thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>IN 1722, this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide their immen&s;e capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government, into two equal parts: The one half, or upwards of &s;ixteen millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds, to be put upon the &s;ame &s;ooting with other government annuities, and not to be &s;ubject to the debts contracted, or lo&s;&s;es incurred, by the directors of the company, in the pro&s;ecution of their mercantile projects; the other half to re|main, as before, a trading &s;tock, and to be &s;ubject to tho&s;e debts and lo&s;&s;es. The petition was too rea&s;onable not to be granted. In 1733, they again petitioned the parliament, that three-fourths of their trading &s;tock might be turned into annuity &s;tock, and only one-fourth remain as trading &s;tock, or expo&s;ed to the hazards ari&s;ing from the bad management of their directors. Both their annuity and trading &s;tocks had, by this time, been reduced more than two millions each, by &s;everal different payments from government; &s;o that this fourth amounted only to 3,662,784<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> In 1748,
<PB N="65" REF="65">
all the demands of the company upon the king of Spain, in con&s;e|quence of the A&s;&s;iento contract, were, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, given up for what was &s;uppo&s;ed an equivalent. An end was put to their trade with the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, the remainder of their trading &s;tock was turned into an annuity &s;tock, and the company cea&s;ed in every re&s;pect to be a trading company.</P>
<P>IT ought to be ob&s;erved, that in the trade which the South Sea Company carried on by means of their annual &s;hip, the only trade by which it ever was expected that they could make any con&s;ider|able profit, they were not without competitors, either in the foreign or in the home market. At Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the competition of the Spani&s;h mer|chants, who brought from Cadiz, to tho&s;e markets, European goods, of the &s;ame kind with the outward cargo of their &s;hip; and in Eng|land they had to encounter that of the Engli&s;h merchants, who im|ported from Cadiz goods of the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, of the &s;ame kind with the inward cargo. The goods, both of the Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h merchants, indeed, were, perhaps, &s;ubject to higher duties. But the lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by the negligence, profu&s;ion, and malver&s;a|tion of the &s;ervants of the company, had probably been a tax much heavier than all tho&s;e duties. That a joint &s;tock company &s;hould be able to carry on &s;ucce&s;sfully any branch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any &s;ort of open and fair compe|tition with them, &s;eems contrary to all experience.</P>
<P>THE old Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India Company was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1600, by a charter from Queen Elizabeth. In the fir&s;t twelve voyages which they &s;itted out for India, they appear to have traded as a regulated company, with &s;eparate &s;tocks, though only in the general &s;hips of the company. In 1612, they united into a joint &s;tock. Their charter was exclu&s;ive, and though not confirmed by act of parlia|ment, was in tho&s;e days &s;uppo&s;ed to convey a real exclu&s;ive privi|lege. For many years, therefore, they were not much di&s;turbed by
<PB N="66" REF="66">
interlopers. Their capital, which never exceeded &s;even hundred and forty-four thou&s;and pounds, and of which fifty pounds was a &s;hare, was not &s;o exorbitant, nor their dealings &s;o exten&s;ive, as to afford either a pretext for gro&s;s negligence and profu&s;ion, or a cover to gro&s;s malver&s;ation. Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome extraordinary lo&s;&s;es, occa&s;ioned partly by the malice of the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, and partly by other accidents, they carried on for many years a &s;ucce&s;sful trade. But in proce&s;s of time, when the principles of liberty were better under&s;tood, it became every day more and more doubtful how far a royal charter, not confirmed by act of parliament, could convey an exclu&s;ive privilege. Upon this que&s;tion the deci&s;ions of the courts of ju&s;tice were not uniform, but varied with the authority of government and the humours of the times. Interlopers multi|plied upon them; and towards the end of the reign of Charles II. through the whole of that of James II. and during a part of that of William III. reduced them to great di&s;tre&s;s. In 1698, a propo&s;al was made to parliament of advancing two millions to government at eight per cent. provided the &s;ub&s;cribers were erected into a new Ea&s;t India Company with exclu&s;ive privileges. The old Ea&s;t India Company offered &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, nearly the amount of their capital, at four per cent. upon the &s;ame conditions. But &s;uch was at that time the &s;tate of public credit, that it was more con|venient for government to borrow two millions at eight per cent. than &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds at four. The propo&s;al of the new &s;ub&s;cribers was accepted, and a new Ea&s;t India Company e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in con&s;equence. The old Ea&s;t India Company, however, had a right to continue their trade till 1701. They had, at the &s;ame time, in the name of their trea&s;urer, &s;ub&s;cribed, very artfully, three hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds into the &s;tock of the new. By a negligence in the expre&s;&s;ion of the act of parliament, which ve&s;ted the Ea&s;t India trade in the &s;ub&s;cribers to this loan of two mil|lions, it did not appear evident that they were all obliged to unite
<PB N="67" REF="67">
into a joint &s;tock. A few private traders, who&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions amounted only to &s;even thou&s;and two hundred pounds, in&s;i&s;ted upon the privilege of trading &s;eparately upon their own &s;tocks and at their own ri&s;k. The old Ea&s;t India Company had a right to a &s;eparate trade upon their old &s;tock till 1701; and they had likewi&s;e, both before and after that period, a right, like that of other private traders, to a &s;eparate trade upon the three hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds, which they had &s;ub&s;cribed into the &s;tock of the new company. The competition of the two companies with the private traders, and with one another, is &s;aid to have well nigh ruined both. Upon a &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ion, in 1730, when a pro|po&s;al was made to parliament for putting the trade under the ma|nagement of a regulated company, and thereby laying it in &s;ome mea&s;ure open, the Ea&s;t India Company, in oppo&s;ition to this pro|po&s;al, repre&s;ented in very &s;trong terms, what had been, at this time, the mi&s;erable effects, as they thought them, of this competition. In India, they &s;aid, it rai&s;ed the price of goods &s;o high, that they were not worth the buying; and in England, by over&s;tocking the market, it &s;unk their price &s;o low, that no profit could be made by them. That by a more plentiful &s;upply, to the great advantage and conve|niency of the publick, it mu&s;t have reduced, very much, the price of India goods in the Engli&s;h market, cannont well be doubted; but that it &s;hould have rai&s;ed very much their price in the Indian market, &s;eems not very probable, as all the extraordinary demand which that competition could occa&s;ion, mu&s;t have been but as a drop of water in the immen&s;e ocean of Indian commerce. The increa&s;e of de|mand, be&s;ides, though in the beginning it may &s;ometimes rai&s;e the price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long-run. It encou|rages production, and thereby increa&s;es the competition of the pro|ducers, who, in order to under&s;ell one another, have recour&s;e to new divi&s;ions of labour and new improvements of art, which might never otherwi&s;e have been thought of. The mi&s;erable effects of
<PB N="68" REF="68">
which the company complained, were the cheapne&s;s of con&s;umption and the encouragement given to production, preci&s;ely the two ef|fects which it is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of political oeconomy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave this doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In 1702, the two companies were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, united by an indenture tri|partite, to which the queen was the third party; and in 1708, they were, by act of parliament, perfectly con&s;olidated into one company by their pre&s;ent name of the United Company of Merchants trading to the Ea&s;t Indies. Into this act it was thought worth while to in&s;ert a clau&s;e, allowing the &s;eparate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas 1711, but at the &s;ame time empowering the di|rectors, upon three years notice, to redeem their little capital of &s;even thou&s;and two hundred pounds, and thereby to convert the whole &s;tock of the company into a joint-&s;tock. By the &s;ame act, the capital of the company, in con&s;equence of a new loan to go|vernment, was augmented from two millions to three millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds. In 1743, the company advanced an|other million to government. But this million being rai&s;ed, not by a call upon the proprietors, but by &s;elling annuities and contracting bond-debts, it did not augment the &s;tock upon which the proprietors could claim a dividend. It augmented, however, their trading &s;tock, it being equally liable with the other three millions two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds, to the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained, and debts contracted, by the company in pro&s;ecution of their mercantile projects. From 1708, or at lea&s;t from 1711, this company, being delivered from all competitors, and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the monopoly of the Engli&s;h commerce to the Ea&s;t Indies, carried on a &s;ucce&s;sful trade, and from their profits made annually a moderate dividend to their proprietors. During the French war, which began in 1741, the ambition of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, involved them in the wars of the Carnatic, and in the politics of the Indian princes. After
<PB N="69" REF="69">
many &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and equally &s;ignal lo&s;&s;es, they at la&s;t lo&s;t Madras, at that time their principal &s;ettlement in India. It was re|&s;tored to them by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and about this time the &s;pirit of war and conque&s;t &s;eems to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ervants in India, and never &s;ince to have left them. During the French war, which began in 1755, their arms partook of the general good fortune of tho&s;e of Great Britain. They defended Madras, took Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired the revenues of a rich and exten&s;ive territory, amounting, it was then &s;aid, to upwards of three millions a-year. They remained for &s;everal years in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this revenue: But in 1767, ad|mini&s;tration laid claim to their territorial acqui&s;itions, and the re|venue ari&s;ing from them, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company, in compen&s;ation for this claim, agreed to pay to go|vernment four hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year. They had before this gradually augmented their dividend from about &s;ix to ten per cent.; that is, upon their capital of three millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds, they had increa&s;ed it by a hundred and twenty|eight thou&s;and pounds, or had rai&s;ed it from one hundred and ninety-two thou&s;and, to three hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds a-year. They were attempting about this time to rai&s;e it &s;till fur|ther, to twelve and a half per cent. which would have made their annual payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay annually to government, or to four hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year. But during the two years in which their agreement with government was to take place, they were re&s;trained from any fur|ther increa&s;e of dividend by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acts of parliament, of which the object was to enable them to make a &s;peedier progre&s;s in the payment of their debts, which were at this time e&s;timated at upwards of &s;ix or &s;even millions &s;terling. In 1769, they renewed their agreement with government for five years more, and &s;tipu|lated, that during the cour&s;e of that period they &s;hould be allowed
<PB N="70" REF="70">
gradually to increa&s;e their dividend to twelve and a half per cent. never increa&s;ing it, however, more than one per cent. in one year. This increa&s;e of dividend, therefore, when it had ri&s;en to its utmo&s;t height, could augment their annual payments, to their proprietors and government together, but by &s;ix hundred and eight thou&s;and pounds, beyond what they had been before their late ter|ritorial acqui&s;itions. What the gro&s;s revenue of tho&s;e territorial acqui&s;itions was &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to, has already been mentioned; and by an account brought by the Cruttenden Ea&s;t Indiaman in 1768, the nett revenue, clear of all deductions and military charges, was &s;tated at two millions forty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-&s;even pounds. They were &s;aid at the &s;ame time to po&s;&s;e&s;s an|other revenue, ari&s;ing partly from lands, but chiefly from the cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;hed at their different &s;ettlements, amounting to four hundred and thirty-nine thou&s;and pounds. The profits of their trade too, according to the evidence of their chairman before the Hou&s;e of Commons, amounted at this time to at lea&s;t four hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year; according to that of their accomptant, to at lea&s;t five hundred thou&s;and; according to the lowe&s;t account, at lea&s;t equal to the highe&s;t dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors. So great a revenue might certainly have afforded an augmentation of &s;ix hundred and eight thou&s;and pounds in their annual payments; and at the &s;ame time have left a large &s;inking fund &s;ufficient for the &s;peedy reduction of their debts. In 1773, however, their debts, in&s;tead of being reduced, were augmented by an arrear to the trea&s;ury in the payment of the four hundred thou&s;and pounds, by another to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for duties unpaid, by a large debt to the bank for money borrowed, and by a fourth for bills drawn upon them from India, and wantonly accepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds. The di&s;tre&s;s which the&s;e accumulated claims brought upon them, obliged them, not only to reduce all at once their dividend to &s;ix per cent. but to throw them&s;elves upon the mercy of government, and to &s;upplicate, fir&s;t, a relea&s;e from the
<PB N="71" REF="71">
further payment of the &s;tipulated four hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year; and, &s;econdly, a loan of fourteen hundred thou&s;and, to &s;ave them from immediate bankruptey. The great increa&s;e of their fortune had, it &s;eems, only &s;erved to furni&s;h their &s;ervants with a pretext for greater profu&s;ion, and a cover for greater malver&s;ation, than in proportion even to that increa&s;e of fortune. The conduct of their &s;ervants in India, and the general &s;tate of their affairs both in India and in Europe, became the &s;ubjects of a parliamentary in|quiry; in con&s;equence of which &s;everal very important alterations were made in the con&s;titution of their government, both at home and abroad. In India, their principal &s;ettlements of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, which had before been altogether independent of one another, were &s;ubjected to a governor-general, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a council of four a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, parliament a&s;&s;uming to it&s;elf the fir&s;t nomination of this governor and council who were to re&s;ide at Calcutta; that city having now become, what Madras was before, the mo&s;t im|portant of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in India. The court of the mayor of Calcutta, originally in&s;tituted for the trial of mercantile cau&s;es, which aro&s;e in the city and neighbourhood, had gradually extended its jurisdiction with the exten&s;ion of the empire. It was now re|duced and con&s;ined to the original purpo&s;e of its in&s;titution. In|&s;tead of it a new &s;upreme court of judicature was e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|&s;i&s;ting of a chief ju&s;tice and three judges to be appointed by the crown. In Europe, the qualification nece&s;&s;ary to entitle a proprietor to vote at their general courts was rai&s;ed, from five hundred pounds, the original price of a &s;hare in the &s;tock of the company, to a thou|&s;and pounds. In order to vote upon this qualification too, it was declared nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, if acquired by his own purcha&s;e, and not by inheritance, for at lea&s;t one year, in&s;tead of &s;ix months, the term requi&s;ite before. The court of twenty-four directors had before been cho&s;en annually; but it was now enacted, that each director &s;hould, for the future, be cho&s;en for four years; &s;ix
<PB N="72" REF="72">
of them, however, to go out of office by rotation every year, and not to be capable of being re-cho&s;en at the election of the &s;ix new directors for the en&s;uing year. In con&s;equence of the&s;e alterations, the courts, both of the proprietors and directors, it was expected, would be likely to act with more dignity and &s;teadine&s;s than they had u&s;ually done before. But it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, by any alter|ations, to render tho&s;e courts, in any re&s;pect, fit to govern, or even to &s;hare in the government of a great empire; becau&s;e the greater part of their members mu&s;t always have too little intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of that empire, to give any &s;erious attention to what may promote it. Frequently a man of great, &s;ometimes even a man of &s;mall fortune, is willing to purcha&s;e a thou&s;and pounds &s;hare in India &s;tock, merely for the influence which he expects to acquire by a vote in the court of proprietors. It gives him a &s;hare, though not in the plunder, yet in the appointment of the plunderers of India; the court of directors, though they make that appointment, being nece&s;&s;arily more or le&s;s under the influence of the proprietors, who not only elect tho&s;e directors, but &s;ometimes over-rule the appoint|ments of their &s;ervants in India. Provided he can enjoy this in|fluence for a few years, and thereby provide for a certain number of his friends, he frequently cares little about the dividend, or even about the value of the &s;tock upon which his vote is founded. About the pro&s;perity of the great empire, in the government of which that vote gives him a &s;hare, he &s;eldom cares at all. No other &s;overeigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, &s;o perfectly indifferent about the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of their &s;ubjects, the im|provement or wa&s;te of their dominions, the glory or di&s;grace of their admini&s;tration; as, from irre&s;i&s;tible moral cau&s;es, the greater part of the proprietors of &s;uch a mercantile company are, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be. This indifference too was more likely to be increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by &s;ome of the new regulations, which were made in con&s;equence of the parliamentary inquiry. By a re&s;olution of the
<PB N="73" REF="73">
Hou&s;e of Commons, for example, it was declared, that when the fourteen hundred thou&s;and pounds lent to the company by govern|ment &s;hould be paid, and their bond-debts be reduced to fifteen hun|dred thou&s;and pounds, they might then, and not till then, divide eight per cent. upon their capital; and that whatever remained of their revenues and nett profits at home, &s;hould be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the exchequer for the u&s;e of the publick, and the fourth to be re&s;erved as a fund, either for the further reduction of their bond-debts, or for the di&s;charge of other contingent exigencies, which the company might labour under. But if the company were bad &s;tewards, and bad &s;overeigns, when the whole of their nett revenue and profits belonged to them&s;elves, and were at their own di&s;po&s;al, they were &s;urely not likely to be better, when three-fourths of them were to belong to other people, and the other fourth, though to be laid out for the benefit of the com|pany, yet to be &s;o, under the in&s;pection, and with the approbation, of other people.</P>
<P>IT might be more agreeable to the company that their own &s;er|vants and dependants &s;hould have, either the plea&s;ure of wa&s;ting, or the profit of embezzling, whatever &s;urplus might remain, after pay|ing the propo&s;ed dividend of eight per cent. than that it &s;hould come into the hands of a &s;et of people with whom tho&s;e re&s;olutions could &s;carce fail to &s;et them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, at variance. The intere&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ervants and dependants might &s;o far predominate in the court of proprietors as &s;ometimes, to di&s;po&s;e it to &s;upport the authors of depredations which had been committed in direct viola|tion of its own authority. With the majority of proprietors, the &s;upport even of the authority of their own court, might &s;ometimes be a matter of le&s;s con&s;equence than the &s;upport of tho&s;e who had &s;et that authority at defiance.</P>
<P>THE regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the di&s;orders of the company's government in India. Notwith&s;tanding,
<PB N="74" REF="74">
that, during a momentary fit of good conduct, they had, at one time, collected, into the trea&s;ury of Calcutta, more than three mil|lions &s;terling, notwith&s;tanding, that, they had afterwards extended, either their dominion, or their depredations, over a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fertile countries in India; all was wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed. They found them&s;elves altogether unpre|pared to &s;top or re&s;i&s;t the incur&s;ion of Hyder Ali; and, in con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e di&s;orders, the company is now (1784) in greater di&s;tre&s;s than ever; and, in order to prevent immediate bankruptey, is once more reduced to &s;upplicate the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of government. Different plans have been propo&s;ed by the different parties in parlia|ment, for the better management of its affairs. And all tho&s;e plans &s;eem to agree in &s;uppo&s;ing, what was indeed always abundantly evi|dent, that it is altogether unfit to govern its territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Even the company it&s;elf &s;eems to be convinced of its own incapa|city &s;o far, and &s;eems, upon that account, willing to give them up to government.</P>
<P>WITH the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing forts and garri&s;ons, in di&s;tant and barbarous countries, is nece&s;&s;arily connected the right of making peace and war in tho&s;e countries. The joint &s;tock companies which have had the one right, have con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed the other, and have frequently had it expre&s;sly conferred upon them. How un|ju&s;tly, how capriciou&s;ly, how cruelly they have commonly exerci&s;ed it, is too well known from recent experience.</P>
<P>WHEN a company of merchants undertake, at their own ri&s;k and expence, to e&s;tabli&s;h a new trade with &s;ome remote and barbarous nation, it may not be unrea&s;onable to incorporate them into a joint &s;tock company, and to grant them, in ca&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s, a mono|poly of the trade for a certain number of years. It is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t natural way in which the &s;tate can recompen&s;e them for hazarding a dangerous and expen&s;ive experiment, of which the
<PB N="75" REF="75">
publick is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the &s;ame principles upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new book to its author. But upon the expiration of the term, the monopoly ought certainly to determine; the forts and garri&s;ons, if it was found nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h any, to be taken into the hands of government, their value to be paid to the com|pany, and the trade to be laid open to all the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate. By a perpetual monopoly, all the other &s;ubjects of the &s;tate are taxed very ab&s;urdly in two different ways; fir&s;t, by the high price of goods, which, in the ca&s;e of a free trade, they could buy much cheaper; and, &s;econdly, by their total exclu&s;ion from a branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, which it might be both convenient and profitable for many of them to carry on. It is for the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of all purpo&s;es too that they are taxed in this manner. It is merely to enable the company to &s;upport the negligence, profu&s;ion, and malver&s;ation of their own &s;ervants, who&s;e di&s;orderly conduct &s;eldom allows the di|vidend of the company to exceed the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are altogether free, and very frequently makes it fall even a good deal &s;hort of that rate. Without a monopoly, how|ever, a joint &s;tock company, it would appear from experience, can|not long carry on any branch of foreign trade. To buy in one market, in order to &s;ell, with profit, in another, when there are many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occa&s;ional variations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent variations in the competition, or in the &s;upply which that demand is likely to get from other people, and to &s;uit with dexterity and judgment both the quantity and quality of each a&s;&s;ortment of goods to all the&s;e circum&s;tances, is a &s;pecies of warfare of which the ope|rations are continually changing, and which can &s;carce ever be con|ducted &s;ucce&s;sfully, without &s;uch an unremitting exertion of vigi|lance and attention, as cannot long be expected from the directors
<PB N="76" REF="76">
of a joint &s;tock company. The Ea&s;t India Company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of their exclu&s;ive privilege, have a right, by act of parliament, to continue a cor|poration with a joint &s;tock, and to trade in their corporate capacity to the Ea&s;t Indies in common with the re&s;t of their fellow-&s;ubjects. But in this &s;ituation, the &s;uperior vigilance and attention of private adventurers would, in all probability, &s;oon make them weary of the trade.</P>
<P>AN eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political oeconomy, the Abb&eacute; Morellet, gives a li&s;t of fifty-five joint &s;tock companies for foreign trade, which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of Europe &s;ince the year 1600, and which, accord|ing to him, have all failed from mi&s;management, notwith&s;tanding they had exclu&s;ive privileges. He has been mi&s;informed with re|gard to the hi&s;tory of two or three of them, which were not joint &s;tock companies and have not failed. But, in compen&s;ation, there have been &s;everal joint &s;tock companies which have failed, and which he has omitted.</P>
<P>THE only trades which it &s;eems po&s;&s;ible for a joint &s;tock com|pany to carry on &s;ucce&s;sfully, without an exclu&s;ive privilege, are tho&s;e, of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a Routine, or to &s;uch a uniformity of method as ad|mits of little or no variation. Of this kind is, fir&s;t, the banking trade; &s;econdly, the trade of in&s;urance from &s;ire, and from &s;ea ri&s;k and capture in time of war; thirdly, the trade of making and main|taining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly, the &s;imilar trade of bringing water for the &s;upply of a great city.</P>
<P>THOUGH the principles of the banking trade may appear &s;ome|what ab&s;tru&s;e, the practice is capable of being reduced to &s;trict rules. To depart upon any occa&s;ion from tho&s;e rules, in con&s;equence of &s;ome flattering &s;peculation of extraordinary gain, is almo&s;t always extreme|ly dangerous, and frequently fatal to the banking company which
<PB N="77" REF="77">
attempts it. But the con&s;titution of joint &s;tock companies renders them in general more tenacious of e&s;tabli&s;hed rules than any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, &s;eem extremely well fitted for this trade. The principal banking companies in Europe, ac|cordingly, are joint &s;tock companies, many of which manage their trade very &s;ucce&s;sfully without any exclu&s;ive privilege. The Bank of England has no other exclu&s;ive privilege, except that no other bank|ing company in England &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of more than &s;ix per&s;ons. The two banks of Edinburgh are joint &s;tock companies without any exclu&s;ive privilege.</P>
<P>THE value of the ri&s;k, either from fire, or from lo&s;s by &s;ea, or by capture, though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits, however, of &s;uch a gro&s;s e&s;timation as renders it, in &s;ome degree, reducible to &s;trict rule and method. The trade of in|&s;urance, therefore, may be carried on &s;ucce&s;sfully by a joint &s;tock company, without any exclu&s;ive privilege. Neither the London A&s;&s;urance, nor the Royal Exchange A&s;&s;urance Companies, have any &s;uch privilege.</P>
<P>WHEN a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the ma|nagement of it becomes quite &s;imple and ea&s;y, and is reducible to &s;trict rule and method. Even the making of it is &s;o, as it may be contracted for with undertakers at &s;o much a mile, and &s;o much a lock. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of a canal, an aqueduct, or a great pipe for bringing water to &s;upply a great city. Such under|takings, therefore, may be, and accordingly frequently are, very &s;ucce&s;sfully managed by joint &s;tock companies without any exclu|&s;ive privilege.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h a joint &s;tock company, however, for any undertak|ing, merely becau&s;e &s;uch a company might be capable of managing it &s;ucce&s;sfully; or to exempt a particular &s;et of dealers from &s;ome of the general laws which take place with regard to all their neigh|bours,
<PB N="78" REF="78">
merely becau&s;e they might be capable of thriving if they had &s;uch an exemption, would certainly not be rea&s;onable. To render &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment perfectly rea&s;onable, with the circum&s;tance of being reducible to &s;trict rule and method, two other circum&s;tances ought to concur. Fir&s;t, it ought to appear with the cleare&s;t evidence, that the undertaking is of greater and more general utility than the greater part of common trades; and &s;econdly, that it requires a greater capital than can ea&s;ily be collected into a private copartnery. If a moderate capital was &s;ufficient, the great utility of the undertaking would not be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing a joint &s;tock com|pany; becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, the demand for what it was to produce would readily and ea&s;ily be &s;upplied by private adventurers. In the four trades above mentioned, both tho&s;e circum&s;tances concur.</P>
<P>THE great and general utility of the banking trade, when pru|dently managed, has been fully explained in the &s;econd book of this Inquiry. But a publick bank which is to &s;upport publick credit, and upon particular emergencies to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to the amount, perhaps, of &s;everal millions, a year or two before it comes in, requires a greater capital than can ea&s;ily be collected into any private copartnery.</P>
<P>THE trade of in&s;urance gives great &s;ecurity to the fortunes of private people, and by dividing among a great many that lo&s;s which would ruin an individual, makes it fall light and ea&s;y upon the whole &s;ociety. In order to give this &s;ecurity, however, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that the in&s;urers &s;hould have a very large capital. Before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the two joint &s;tock companies for in&s;urance in Lon|don, a li&s;t, it is &s;aid, was laid before the attorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private in&s;urers who had failed in the cour&s;e of a few years.</P>
<P>THAT navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are &s;ome|times nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying a great city with water, are of great and general utility; while, at the &s;ame time, they frequently require
<PB N="79" REF="79">
a greater expence, than &s;uits the fortunes of private people, is &s;uffi|ciently obvious.</P>
<P>EXCEPT the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to recollect any other in which all the three circum&s;tances, requi&s;ite for rendering rea&s;onable the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a joint &s;tock company, concur. The Engli&s;h copper company of London, the lead &s;melt|ing company, the gla&s;s-grinding company, have not even the pretext of any great or &s;ingular utility in the object which they pur&s;ue; nor does the pur&s;uit of that object &s;eem to require any expence un&s;uit|able to the fortunes of many private men. Whether the trade which tho&s;e companies carry on, is reducible to &s;uch &s;trict rule and method as to render it fit for the management of a joint &s;tock company, or whether they have any rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their extraordinary profits, I do not pretend to know. The mine-adventurers company has been long ago bankrupt. A &s;hare in the &s;tock of the Briti&s;h Linen Company of Edinburgh &s;ells, at pre&s;ent, very much below par, though le&s;s &s;o than it did &s;ome years ago. The joint &s;tock compa|nies, which are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the publick &s;pirited purpo&s;e of promot|ing &s;ome particular manufacture, over and above managing their own affairs ill, to the diminution of the general &s;tock of the &s;ociety, can in other re&s;pects &s;carce ever fail to do more harm than good. Notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t upright intentions, the unavoidable par|tiality of their directors to particular branches of the manufacture, of which the undertakers mi&s;lead and impo&s;e upon them, is a real di&s;|couragement to the re&s;t, and nece&s;&s;arily breaks, more or le&s;s, that natural proportion which would otherwi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf between judicious indu&s;try and profit, and which, to the general indu&s;try of the country, is of all encouragements the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t effectual.</P>
