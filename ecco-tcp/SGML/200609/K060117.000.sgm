<HEAD>AN APPEAL TO <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope the Time is come at la&s;t, when the Voice of moderate Principles may be heard; hitherto the Noi&s;e has been &s;o great, and the Prejudices and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men &s;o &s;trong, that it had been but in vain to offer at any Argument, or for any Man to talk of giving a Rea&s;on for his Actions: And this alone has been the Cau&s;e why, when other Men, who, I think, have le&s;s to &s;ay in thier own Defence, are appealing to the Publick, and &s;truggling to defend them&s;elves, I alone have been &s;ilent under the infinite Clamours and Reproaches, cau&s;ele&s;s Cur&s;es, unu&s;ual Threatnings, and the mo&s;t unju&s;t and in|jurious Treatment in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
I hear much of Peoples calling out to puni&s;h the Guilty; but very few are concern'd to clear the Innocent. I hope &s;ome will be inclin'd to Judge impartially, and have yet re&s;erv'd &s;o much of the Chri&s;tian, as to be|lieve, and at lea&s;t to hope, that a rational Creature cannot abandon him&s;elf &s;o as to act without &s;ome Rea&s;on, and are willing not only to have me defend my &s;elf, but to be able to an&s;wer for me where they hear me cau&s;le&s;ly in&s;ulted by others, and therefore are willing to have &s;uch ju&s;t Arguments put into their Mouths as the Cau&s;e will bear.</P>

<ITEM>1. I think I have long enough been made <HI>Fabula Vulgi,</HI> and born the Weight of general
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Slander; and I &s;hould be wanting to Truth, to my Family, and to my Self, if I did not give a fair and true State of my Conduct for impartial Men to judge of, when I am no more in being to an&s;wer for my &s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By the Hints of Mortality, and by the Infirmities of a Life of Sorrow and Fatigue, I have Rea&s;on to think that I am not a great way off from, if not very near to the great Ocean of Eternity, and the time may not be long e're I embark on the la&s;t Voyage: Wherefore, I think, I &s;hould <HI>even Accounts</HI> with this World before I go, that no Actions (Slanders) may lie again&s;t my Heirs, Executors, Admini&s;trators, and A&s;|&s;igns, to di&s;turb them in the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Father's (Character) In|heritance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I fear, <HI>God grant I have not a &s;econd Sight in it,</HI> that this lucid Interval of Tem|per and Moderation which &s;hines, <HI>tho' dimly too</HI> upon us at this time, will be but of &s;hort Continuance, and that &s;ome Men, who know not how to u&s;e the Advantage God has put into their Hands with Moderation, will p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, in &s;pight of the be&s;t Prince in the World, at &s;uch extravagant Things, and act with &s;uch an intemperate Forwardne&s;s, as will revive the Heats and Animo&s;ities which wi&s;e and good Men were in hopes &s;hould be allay'd by the happy Acce&s;&s;ion of the King to the Throne.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is and ever was my Opinion, that Mode|ration is the only Vertue by which the Peace
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and Tranquillity of this Nation can be pre|&s;erv'd, even the King him&s;elf, <HI>I believe his Ma|je&s;ty will allow me that Freedom,</HI> can only be happy in the Enjoyment of the Crown by a moderate Admini&s;tration, if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be oblig'd, contrary to his known Di&s;po&s;ition, to joyn with intemperate Councils; if it does not le&s;&s;en his Security, I am per&s;waded it will le&s;&s;en his Satisfaction. It cannot be plea&s;ant or agreeable, and, <HI>I think,</HI> it cannot be &s;afe to any ju&s;t Prince to Rule over a divided Peo|ple, &s;plit into incens'd and exa&s;perated Parties: Tho' a skilful Mariner may have Courage to ma&s;ter a Tempe&s;t, and goes fearle&s;s thro' a Storm, yet he can never be &s;aid to delight in the Danger; a fre&s;h fair Gale, and a quiet Sea, is the Plea&s;ure of his Voyage, and we have a Saying worth Notice to them that are other|wi&s;e minded, <HI>Qui amat periculum periibat in Illo.</HI></P>
<P>To attain at the happy Calm, which, as I &s;ay, is the Safety of <HI>Britain,</HI> is the Que&s;tion which &s;hould now move us all; and he would Merit to be call'd the Nation's Phy&s;ician that could pre&s;cribe the Specifick for it. I think I may be allow'd to &s;ay, a <HI>Conque&s;t of Parties</HI> will ne|ver do it; <HI>a Ballance of Parties MAY.</HI> Some are for <HI>the former;</HI> they talk high of Puni&s;h|ments, letting Blood, revenging the Treat|ment they have met with, and the like: If they, <HI>not knowing what Spirit they are of,</HI> think this the Cour&s;e to be taken, let them try their Hands, I &s;hall give them for lo&s;t, and look for their Downfal <HI>from that time;</HI> for the Ruin of all &s;uch Tempers &s;lumbereth not.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
It is many Years that I have profe&s;s'd my &s;elf an Enemy to all Precipitations in publick Admini&s;trations; and often I have attempted to &s;hew, that hot Councils have ever been di&s;tructive to tho&s;e who have made u&s;e of them: Indeed they have not always been a Di&s;|advantage to the Nation, as in King <HI>James</HI> II's Reign, where, as I have often &s;aid in Print, his Precipitation was the Safety of us all; and if he had proceeded temperately and politick|ly, we had been undone, <HI>Faelix quem faciunt.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e things have been &s;poken when your Ferment has been too high for any thing to be heard; whether you will hear it now or not, <HI>I know not,</HI> and therefore it was that I &s;aid, <HI>I fear</HI> the pre&s;ent Ce&s;&s;ation of Party-Arms will not hold long.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons why I think this is the proper Juncture for me to give &s;ome Account of my &s;elf, and of my pa&s;t Conduct to the World; and that I may do this as effe|ctually as I can, being perhaps never more to &s;peak from the Pre&s;s, I &s;hall, as conci&s;ely as I can, give an Abridgment of my own Hi&s;tory during the few unhappy Years I have employ'd my &s;elf, or been employ'd in Publick in the World.</P>
<P>Misfortunes in Bu&s;ine&s;s having unhing'd me from Matters of Trade, it was about the Year 1694. when I was invited by &s;ome Merchants, with whom I had corre&s;ponded abroad, and &s;ome al&s;o at home, to &s;ettle at <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that with Offers of very good Commi&s;&s;ions; but Providence, which had other Work for me to do, placed a &s;ecret Aver&s;ion in my Mind to
<PB N="6" REF="8">
quitting <HI>England</HI> upon any account, and made me refu&s;e the be&s;t Offers of that kind, to be concern'd with &s;ome eminent Per&s;ons at home, in propo&s;ing <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> to the Go|vernment for rai&s;ing Money to &s;upply the Oc|ca&s;ions of the War then newly begun. Some time after this, I was, without the lea&s;t Appli|cation of mine, and being then &s;eventy Miles from <HI>London,</HI> &s;ent for to be Accomptant to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Gla&s;s Duty, in which Service I continued to the Determination of their Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During this time, there came out a vile abhor'd Pamphlet, in very ill Ver&s;e, written by one Mr. <HI>Tutchin,</HI> and call'd, THE FOREIGN|ERS: In which the Author, <HI>who he was I then knew not,</HI> fell per&s;onally upon the King him&s;elf, and then upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation; and after having reproach'd his Maje&s;ty with Crimes, that his wor&s;t Enemy could not think of with|out Horror, he &s;ums up all in the odious Name of FOREIGNER.</P>
<P>This fill'd me with a kind of Rage again&s;t the Book, and gave birth to a Trifle which I never could hope &s;hould have met with &s;o ge|neral an Acceptation as it did, I mean, <HI>The True-Born-Engli&s;hman.</HI> How this Poem was the Occa&s;ion of my being known to his Maje&s;ty; how I was afterwards receiv'd by him; how Employ'd; and how, above my Capacity of de&s;erving, Rewarded, is no Part of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and is only mention'd here as I take all Occa&s;ions to do for the expre&s;&s;ing the Honour I ever pre&s;erv'd for the Immortal and Glorious Memory of that Greate&s;t and Be&s;t of Princes,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and who it was my Honour and Advantage to call Ma&s;ter as well as Sovereign, who&s;e Good|ne&s;s to me I never forgot, neither can forget; and who&s;e Memory I never patiently heard abu&s;ed, nor ever can do &s;o; and who had he liv'd, would never have &s;uffered me to be treated as I have been in the World.</P>
<P>But Heaven for our Sins remov'd him in Judgment. How far the Treatment he met with, from the Nation he came to &s;ave, and who&s;e Deliverance he fini&s;hed, was ad|mitted by Heaven to be a Means of his Death, I de&s;ire to forget for their &s;akes who are guilty; and if this calls any of it to mind, it is menti|on'd to move them to treat him better who is now with like Principles of Goodne&s;s and Cle|mency appointed by God, and the Con&s;titu|tion, to be their Sovereign; lea&s;t he that pro|tects righteous Princes, avenges the Injuries they receive from an ungrateful People, by giving them up to the Confu&s;ions their Mad|ne&s;s leads them to.</P>
<P>And in their ju&s;t acclamations at the happy acce&s;&s;ion of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty to the Throne, I cannot but advi&s;e them to look back, and call to mind who it was that fir&s;t Guided them to the Family of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and to pa&s;s by all the Popi&s;h Branches of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> re|cognizing the ju&s;t authority of Parliament, in the undoubted Right of Limiting the Succe&s;|&s;ion, and E&s;tabli&s;hing that Glorious Maxim of our Settlement, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That <HI>it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of this Prote&s;tant Kingdom to be Govern'd by a Popi&s;h Prince.</HI> I &s;ay let them cell to mind who it was that guided
<PB N="8" REF="10">
their Thoughts fir&s;t to the Prote&s;tant Race of our own Kings in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and that it is to King <HI>William,</HI> next to Heaven it &s;elf, to whom we owe the Enjoying a Prote|&s;tant King at this time. I need not go back to the particulars of his Maje&s;ty's Conduct in that Affair, his Journey in Per&s;on to the Country of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the Court of <HI>Zell;</HI> his particular management of the Affair after|wards at home, perfecting the De&s;ign, by naming the Illu&s;trious Family to the Nation, and bringing about a Parliamentary Settle|ment to effect it, entailing thereby the Crown in &s;o effectual a manner as we &s;ee has been &s;uf|ficient to prevent the wor&s;t De&s;igns of our <HI>Jacobite</HI> People in behalf of the Pretender; a Settlement, together with the &s;ub&s;equent Acts which followed it, and the Union with <HI>Scot|land</HI> which made it unalterable, that gave a compleat Satisfaction to tho&s;e who knew and under&s;tood it, and removed tho&s;e terrible ap|prehen&s;ions of the Pretender (which &s;ome en|tertain'd) from the minds of others who were yet as zealous again&s;t him as it was po&s;&s;ible for any to be: Upon this Settlement, as <HI>I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently.</HI> I grounded my Opinion, <HI>which I often expre&s;s'd, (viz.)</HI> that I did not &s;ee it po&s;&s;ible the Jacobites could ever &s;et up their Idol here; and I think my Opinion abun|dantly ju&s;tify'd in the Con&s;equences, of which by and by.</P>
<P>This Digre&s;&s;ion, as a debt to the Glorious Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> I could not in Ju|&s;tice omit, and as the Reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty is e&s;teem'd Happy, and look'd upon
<PB N="9" REF="11">
as a Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven by us, it will mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lead us to ble&s;s the Memory of King <HI>William</HI> to whom we owe &s;o much of it; How ea&s;ily could his Maje&s;ty have led us to other Branches, who&s;e Relation to the Crown might have had large pretences? What Prince but would have &s;ubmitted to have Educated a Succe&s;&s;or of their Race in the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion for the &s;ake of &s;uch a Crown&mdash;? But the King, who had our Happine&s;s in View, and &s;aw as far into it as any humane &s;ight could Penetrate, who knew we were not to be Govern'd by unexperienc'd Youths; that the Prote&s;tant Religion was not to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Political Converts; and that Princes under <HI>French</HI> Influence, or In&s;tructed in <HI>French</HI> Poli|ticks, were not proper In&s;truments to pre|&s;erve the Liberties of <HI>Britain,</HI> fixt his Eyes upon the Family who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Crown, as not only having an undoubted Relation to it by Blood, but as being fir&s;t and principally Zealous and Powerful a&s;&s;ertors of the Prote|&s;tant Religion and Intere&s;t again&s;t Popery; And <HI>Secondly,</HI> &s;tored with a vi&s;ible Succe&s;&s;ion of worthy and promi&s;ing Branches, who ap|pear'd equal to the Weight of Government, quallified to fill a Throne, and guide a Nation which, without Reflection, are not famed to be the mo&s;t ea&s;y to Rule in the World.</P>
<P>Whether the Con&s;equence has been a Cre|dit to King <HI>William</HI>'s Judgment I need not &s;ay, I am not Writing Panegyricks here, but do|ing ju&s;tice to the Memory of the King my Ma|&s;ter, who I have had the Honour very often to hear expre&s;s him&s;elf with great &s;atisfaction,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in having brought the Settlement of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to &s;o good an I&s;&s;ue; and to repeat his Maje&s;ty's own Words, <HI>That he knew no Prince in</HI> Europe <HI>&s;o fit to be King of</HI> England, <HI>as the Elector of</HI> Hanover. I am per&s;uaded, without any Flattery, that if it &s;hould not every way an&s;wer the Expectations his Maje&s;ty had of it, the fault will be our own: God Grant the King may have more Comfort of his Crown than we &s;uffer'd King <HI>William</HI> to have.</P>
<P>The King being Dead, and the Queen Pro|claim'd, the Hot Men of that Side, as Hot Men of all Sides do, Thinking the Game in their own Hands, and all other People under their Feet, began to run out into tho&s;e mad Extreams, and precipitate them&s;elves into &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as according to the Fate of all intemperate Councils, ended in their own Confu&s;ions, and threw them at la&s;t out of the Saddle.</P>
<P>The Queen, who, tho' willing to favour the High Church Party, did not thereby de&s;ign the Ruin of tho&s;e who &s;he did not Em|ploy, was &s;oon alarm'd at their wild Con|duct, and turn'd them out, adhering to the moderate Councils of tho&s;e who better under|&s;tood, or more faithfully pur&s;ued her Maje|&s;ty's and their Countries Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Turn fell Sir <HI>Edw. Seymour</HI>'s Party, for &s;o the High Men were then call'd; and to this Turn, we owe the Conver&s;on of &s;everal other Great Men, who became <HI>Whigs</HI> upon that Occa&s;ion, which it is known they were not before; which Conver&s;ion afterwards bega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that unkind Di&s;tinction of Old Whig, and
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Modern Whig, which &s;ome of the former were with very little Ju&s;tice plea&s;ed to run up afterwards to an Extreme very pernicious to both.</P>
<P>But I am gone too far in this Part. I return to my own Story. In the Interval of the&s;e Things, and during the Heat of the fir&s;t Fury of High-&s;lying, I fell a Sacrifice for writing again&s;t the Rage and Madne&s;s of that High Party, and in the Service of the Di&s;&s;enters: What Ju&s;tice I met with, and above all what Mercy, is too well known to need a Repetition.</P>
<P>This Introduction is made that it may bring me to what has been the Foundation of all my further Concern in publick Af|fairs, and will produce a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for my adhering to tho&s;e who&s;e Obligations upon me were too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted, even when many things were done by them which I could not approve; and for this Rea&s;on it is that I think it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h how far I did, or did not adhere to, or joyn in or with the Per&s;ons or Conduct of the late Go|vernment: And tho&s;e who are willing to judge with Impartiality and Charity, will &s;ee rea&s;on to u&s;e me the more tenderly in their Thoughts, when they weigh the Particulars.</P>
<P>I will make no Reflections upon the Treat|ment I met with from the People I &s;uffer'd for, or how I was abandon'd even in my Sufferings, at the &s;ame time that they acknowledg'd the Service it had been to their Cau&s;e; but I mu&s;t mention it to let you know, that while I lay friendle&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s'd in the Pri&s;on of <HI>New|gate,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
my Family ruin'd, and my &s;elf, without Hope of Deliverance, a Me&s;&s;age was brought me from a Per&s;on of Honour, who, till that time, I had never had the lea&s;t Acquaintance with, or Knowledge of, other than by Fame, or by Sight, as we know Men of Quality by &s;eeing them on publick Occa&s;ions. I gave no pre&s;ent An&s;wer to the Per&s;on who brought it, having not duly weighed the Import of the Me&s;&s;age; the Me&s;&s;age was by Word of Month thus: <HI>Pray ask that Gentleman, what I can do for him?</HI> But in return to this kind and generous Me&s;&s;age, I immediately took my Pen and Ink, and writ the Story of the blind Man in the Go&s;|pel, who follow'd our Saviour, and to whom our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord put the Que&s;tion, <HI>What wilt thou that I &s;hould do unto thee?</HI> Who, as if he had made it &s;trange that &s;uch a Que&s;tion &s;hould be ask'd, or as if he had &s;aid, <HI>Lord, doe&s;t thou &s;ee that I am blind, and yet ask me what thou &s;halt do for me?</HI> My An&s;wer is plain in my Mi|&s;ery, <HI>Lord, that I may receive my Sight.</HI></P>
<P>I needed not to make the Application; and from this time, altho' I lay four Months in Pri&s;on after this, and heard no more of it, yet from this time, as I learn'd afterwards, this noble Per&s;on made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to have my Ca&s;e repre&s;ented to Her Maje&s;ty, and Methods taken for my Deliverance.</P>
<P>I mention this Part, becau&s;e I am no more to forget the Obligation upon me to the Queen, than to my fir&s;t Benefactor.</P>
<P>When Her Maje&s;ty came to have the Truth of the Ca&s;e laid before Her, I &s;oon felt the Ef|fects of her Royal Goodne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="13" REF="15">
And fir&s;t, Her Maje&s;ty declar'd, That She left all that Matter to a certain Per&s;on, and did not think he would have u&s;ed me in &s;uch a Manner. Perhaps the&s;e Words may &s;eem imaginary to &s;ome, and the &s;peaking them to be of no Value, and &s;o they would have been if they had not been follow'd with farther and more convincing Proofs of what they imported, which were the&s;e, That Her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed particularly to enquire into my Circum&s;tances and Family, and by my Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Godolphin,</HI> to &s;end a con&s;iderable Supply to my Wife and Family, and to &s;end me to the Pri&s;on Money to pay my Fine, and the Expences of my Di&s;charge. Whether this be a ju&s;t Foundation, let my Enemies judge.</P>
<P>Here is the Foundation on which I built my fir&s;t Sen&s;e of Duty to Her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, and the indelible Bond of Gratitude to my fir&s;t Benefactor.</P>
<P>Gratitude and Fidelity are in&s;eparable from an hone&s;t Man. But to be thus oblig'd by a Stranger, by a Man of Quality and Honour, and after that by the Sovereign, under who&s;e Admini&s;tration I was &s;uffering, let any one put him&s;elf in my &s;tead, and examine upon what Principles I could ever act again&s;t either &s;uch a Queen, or &s;uch a Benefactor; and what mu&s;t my own Heart reproach me with, what blu&s;hes mu&s;t have cover'd my Face when I had look'd in, and call'd my&s;elf ungrateful to him that &s;av'd me thus from di&s;tre&s;s? <HI>Or</HI> Her that fetch'd me out of the Dungeon, and gave my Family Relief? Let any Man, who knows what Prin|ciples
<PB N="14" REF="16">
are, what Engagements of Honour and Gratitude are, make this Ca&s;e his own, and &s;ay what I could have done le&s;s or more than I have done.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go on a little with the Detail of the Obligation, and then I &s;hall de&s;cend to relate what I have done, and what I have not done in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Being deliver'd from the Di&s;tre&s;s I was in, Her Maje&s;ty, who was not &s;atisfy'd to do me Good by a &s;ingle Act of her Bounty, had the Goodne&s;s to think of taking me into her Ser|vice, and I had the Honour to be employ'd in &s;everal honourable, tho' &s;ecret Services, by the Interpo&s;ition of my fir&s;t Benefactor, who then appear'd as a Member in the publick Ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>I had the Happine&s;s to di&s;charge my &s;elf in all the&s;e Tru&s;ts, &s;o much to the Satisfaction of tho&s;e who employ'd me, tho' often times with Difficulty and Danger, that my Lord Trea|&s;urer <HI>Godolphin,</HI> who&s;e Memory I have always honour'd, was pleas'd to continue his Favour to me, and to do me all good Offices with Her Maje&s;ty, even after an unhappy Breach had &s;e|parated him from my fir&s;t Benefactor: The Particulars of which may not be improper to relate; and as it is not an Inju&s;tice to any, &s;o I hope it will not be offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>When upon that fatal Breach, the Secretary of State was di&s;mi&s;s'd from the Service, I look'd upon my &s;elf as lo&s;t, it being a general Rule in &s;uch Ca&s;es, when a great Officer falls, that all who came in by his Intere&s;t fall with him. And re&s;olving never to abandon
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the Fortunes of the Man to whom I ow'd &s;o much of my own, I quitted the u&s;ual Applica|tions which I had made to my Lord Trea|&s;urer.</P>
<P>But my generous Benefactor, when he un|der&s;tood it, frankly told me, That I &s;hould by no means do &s;o; for, &s;aid he, in the mo&s;t engaging terms, My Lord Trea&s;urer will employ you in nothing but what is for the pub|lick Service, and agreeable to your own Sen|timents of Things: And be&s;ides, it is the Queen you are &s;erving, who has been very good to you. Pray apply your &s;elf as you u&s;ed to do; I &s;hall not take it ill from you in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon this I went to wait on my Lord Trea|&s;urer, who receiv'd me with great Freedom, and told me &s;miling, <HI>He had not &s;een me along while.</HI> I told his Lord&s;hip very frankly the Occa&s;ion, That the unhappy Breach that had fallen out, had made me doubtful whether I &s;hould be acceptable to his Lord&s;hip. That I knew it was u&s;ual, when great Per&s;ons fall, that all who were in their Intere&s;t fell with them. That his Lord&s;hip knew the Obliga|tions I was under, and that I could not but fear my Intere&s;t in his Lord&s;hip was le&s;|&s;en'd on that Account. <HI>Not at all Mr.</HI> De Foe, reply'd his Lord&s;hip; <HI>I always think a Man ho|ne&s;t, till I find to the contrary.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this I attended his Lord&s;hip as u&s;ual, and being re&s;olved to remove all po&s;&s;ible Ground of Su&s;picion that I kept any &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence, I never vi&s;ited, or wrote to, or any way corre&s;ponded with my principal
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Benefactor for above three Years; which he &s;o well knew the Rea&s;on of, and &s;o well ap|prov'd that punctual Behaviour in me, that he never took it ill from me at all.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of this Reception, my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> had the Goodne&s;s not only to intro|duce me for the &s;econd time to her Maje&s;ty, and to the Honour of ki&s;&s;ing her Hand, but obtain'd for me the Continuance of an Ap|pointment which Her Maje&s;ty had been pleas'd to make me in Con&s;ideration of a former &s;pecial Service I had done, and in which I had run as much ri&s;que of my Life, as a Grenadier upon the Counter&s;carp; and which Appointment however was fir&s;t obtain'd for me at the Inter|ce&s;&s;ion of my &s;aid fir&s;t Benefactor, and is all owing to that Interce&s;&s;ion, and Her Maje&s;ty's Bounty. Upon this &s;econd Introduction Her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to tell me with a Good|ne&s;s peculiar to Her &s;elf, That &s;he had &s;uch Satisfaction in my former Services, that &s;he had appointed me for another Affair, which was &s;omething Nice, and that my Lord Trea|&s;urer &s;hould tell me the re&s;t; and &s;o I with|drew.</P>
<P>The next Day his Lord&s;hip having com|manded me to attend, told me, That he mu&s;t &s;end me to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and gave me but three Days to prepare my &s;elf. Accordingly I went to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where neither my Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor the manner of my di&s;charging it is mate|rial to this Tract, nor will it be ever any part of my Character that I reveal what &s;hould be concealed; and yet my Errand was &s;uch as
<PB N="17" REF="19">
was far from being unfit for a Sovereign to direct, or an hone&s;t Man to perform; and the Service I did on that Occa&s;ion, as it is not unknown to the greate&s;t Man now in the Nation under the King and the Prince, &s;o I dare &s;ay, his Grace was never di&s;plea&s;ed with the Part I had in it, and I hope will not for|get it.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I mention upon this Account, and no other, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to &s;tate the Obligation I have been in all along to Her Maje&s;ty per|&s;onally, and to my fir&s;t Benefactor princi|pally, by which, <HI>I &s;ay I THINK,</HI> I was at lea&s;t obliged not to act again&s;t them even in tho&s;e things which I might not approve. Whether I have acted with them farther than I ought, &s;hall be &s;poken to by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of the Obligations lay'd on me, and the Per&s;ons by whom, I have this only to add, That I think no Man will &s;ay a Subject could be under greater Bonds to his Prince, or a private Per&s;on to a Mini&s;ter of State; and I &s;hall ever pre&s;erve this Principle, that an hone&s;t Man cannot be ungrateful to his Benefactor.</P>
<P>But let no Man run away now with the No|tion, that I am now intending to plead the Ob|ligation that was upon me from Her Maje&s;ty, or from any other Per&s;on, to ju&s;tify my doing any thing that is not otherwi&s;e to be ju&s;tify'd in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Nothing would be more injurious than &s;uch a Con&s;truction; and therefore I capitulate for &s;o much Ju&s;tice as to explain my &s;elf by this Declaration <HI>(viz.)</HI> That I only &s;peak of the&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Obligations as binding me to a negative Con|duct not to fly in the Face of, or concern my &s;elf in Di&s;putes with tho&s;e to whom I was under &s;uch Obligations, altho' I might not in my Judgment joyn in many things that were done. No Obligation could excu&s;e me in calling Evil Good, or Good Evil; but I am of the Opinion, that I might ju&s;tly think my &s;elf oblig'd to defend what I thought was to be defended, and to be &s;ilent in any thing which I might think was not.</P>
<P>If this is a Crime, I mu&s;t plead guilty, and give in the Hi&s;tory of my Obligation above-mention'd as an Extenuation, at lea&s;t, if not a Ju&s;tification of my Conduct; &s;up|po&s;e a Man's Father was guilty of &s;everal things unlawful and unju&s;tifiable, a Man may heartily dete&s;t the unju&s;tifiable thing, and yet it ought not to be expected that he &s;hould expo&s;e his Father. I think the Ca&s;e on my &s;ide exactly the &s;ame. Nor can the Duty to a Parent be more &s;trongly obliging than the Obligation laid on me: But I mu&s;t allow the Ca&s;e on the other &s;ide not the &s;ame?</P>
<P>And this brings me to the Affirmative, and to enquire what the Matters of Fact are, what I have done, or have not done, on Account of the&s;e Obligations which I have been under.</P>
<P>It is a general Sugge&s;tion, and is affirm'd with &s;uch A&s;&s;urance, that they tell me it is in vain to contradict it; That I have been employ'd by the Earl of <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d,</HI> late Lord Trea&s;urer, in the late Di&s;putes about Publick Affairs, to write for him, or to put it into their own Particulars, have written by his Direction, taken the Ma|terials
<PB N="19" REF="21">
from him, been dictated to, or in&s;truct|ed by him, or by other Per&s;ons from him, by his Order, and the like; and that I have re|ceiv'd a Pen&s;ion, or Sallery, or Payment from his Lord&s;hip for &s;uch Services as the&s;e.</P>
<P>If I could put it into Words that would more fully expre&s;s the Meaning of the&s;e Peo|ple, I profe&s;s I would do it.</P>
<P>One would think it was impo&s;&s;ible; but that &s;ince the&s;e things have been &s;o confident|ly affirm'd, &s;ome Evidence might be produc'd, &s;ome Facts might appear, &s;ome one Body or other might be found that could &s;peak of cer|tain Knowledge: To &s;ay things have been car|ry'd too clo&s;ely to be di&s;cover'd, <HI>is &s;aying no|thing;</HI> for then they mu&s;t own, <HI>that it is not di&s;cover'd:</HI> And how then can they affirm it, as they do, with &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance, as nothing ought to be affirm'd by hone&s;t Men, unle&s;s they were able to prove it?</P>
<P>To &s;peak then to the Fact: Were the Re|proach upon <HI>me only</HI> in this Particular, I &s;hould not mention it; I &s;hould not think it a Reproach to be directed by a Man to whom the Queen had at that time entru&s;ted the Ad|mini&s;tration of the Government. But as it is a Reproach upon his Lord&s;hip, Ju&s;tice re|quires that I do Right in this Ca&s;e. The Thing is true or fal&s;e, I would recommend it to tho&s;e who would be call'd hone&s;t Men, to con&s;ider but one Thing, <HI>(viz.)</HI> What if it &s;hould not be true? Can they ju&s;tify the Inju|ry done to that Per&s;on, or to any Per&s;on con|cern'd? If it cannot be prov'd, if no Ve&s;tiges appear to ground it upon, how can they

charge Men upon Rumours and Reports, and joyn to run Men's Characters down by the Stream of Clamour.</P>
<Q>Sed quo rapit impetus undae.</Q>
<P>In An&s;wer to the Charge, I bear Witne&s;s to Po&s;terity, that every Part of it is fal&s;e and forg'd; and I do &s;olemnly prote&s;t, in the <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> of him that &s;hall Judge us all, both the Slanderers, and the Slandered, that I have not receiv'd any In&s;tructions, Directi|ons, Orders, <HI>or let them call it what they will of that kind,</HI> for the Writing any Part of what I have written, or any Materials for the put|ting together, for the Forming any Book or Pamphlet what&s;oever from the &s;aid Earl of <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d,</HI> late Lord Trea&s;urer, or from any Per&s;on, by his Order, or Direction, &s;ince the Time that the late Earl of <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">in</HI> was Lord Trea&s;urer: Neither did I ever &s;hew, or cau&s;e to be &s;hew'd to his Lord&s;hip, for his Ap|probation, Correction, Alteration, or for any other Cau&s;e, any Book, Paper, or Pam|phlet, which I have Written and Publi&s;h'd be|fore the &s;ame was Printed, work'd off at the Pre&s;s, and Publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>If any Man living can detect me of the lea&s;t Prevarication in this, or in any Part of it, I de&s;ire him to do it by all means; and I chal|lenge all the World to do it&mdash;<HI>And if they cannot,</HI> then I appeal, <HI>as in my Title,</HI> to the Honour and Ju&s;tice of my wor&s;t Enemies, to know upon what Foundation of Truth or Con|&s;cience they can affirm the&s;e things, and for what it is that I bear the&s;e Reproaches.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
In all my Writing, I ever capitulated for my Liberty to &s;peak according to my own Judgment of Things; I ever had that Liberty allow'd me, nor was I ever impo&s;ed upon to write this way or that again&s;t my Judgment by any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I come now hi&s;torically to the Point of Time when my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd from his Employment, and the late unhappy Divi&s;ion broke out at Court; I waited on my Lord the Day he was di&s;plac'd, and humbly ask'd his Lord&s;hip's Direction, what Cour&s;e I &s;hould take? His Lord&s;hip's An&s;wer was, <HI>That he had the &s;ame good Will to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, but not the &s;ame Power; That I was the Queen's Servant, and that all he had done for me, was by Her Maje&s;ty's &s;pecial and particular Direction; and that whoever &s;hould &s;ucceed him, it was not material to me, he &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould be employ'd in nothing relating to the pre&s;ent Differences: My Bu&s;ine&s;s was to wait till I &s;aw things &s;ettled, and then apply my &s;elf to the Mi|ni&s;ters of State, to receive Her Maje&s;ty's Com|mands from them.</HI></P>
<P>It occur'd to me immediately, as a Princi|ple for my Conduct, that it was not material to me what Mini&s;ters Her Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to employ, my Duty was to go along with every Mini&s;try, &s;o far as they did not break in upon the Con&s;titution, and the Laws and Liberties of my Country; my Part being only the Duty of a Subject, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to &s;ubmit to all lawful Commands, and to enter into no Ser|vice which was not ju&s;tifiable by the Laws: To all which I have exactly oblig'd my &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
By this I was providentially ca&s;t back upon my Original Benefactor, who, according to his wonted Goodne&s;s, was plea&s;ed to lay my Ca&s;e before Her Maje&s;ty, and thereby I pre|&s;erv'd my Intere&s;t in Her Maje&s;ty's Favour; but without any Engagement of Service.</P>
<P>As for Con&s;ideration, Pen&s;ion, Gratifica|tion, or Reward, I declare to all the World I have had none; except only that old Ap|pointment which Her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to make me in the Days of the Mini&s;try of my Lord <HI>Godolphin:</HI> Of which I have &s;poken al|ready, and which was for Services done in a foreign Country &s;ome Years before. Neither have I been employ'd, or directed, or order'd, by my Lord T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r afore&s;aid, to do, or not to do, any thing in the Affairs of the un|happy Differences which have &s;o long per|plex'd us, and for which I have &s;uffer'd &s;o many, and &s;uch unju&s;t Reproaches.</P>
<P>I come next to enter into the Matters of Fact, and what it is I have done, or not done; which may ju&s;tify the Treatment I have met with. And fir&s;t, for the Negative Part, what I have not done.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing in the unhappy Breaches which have fallen out, is helping up Scandal upon the Per&s;ons and Conduct of Men of Ho|nour on one Side, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> on the other; tho&s;e unworthy Methods of falling upon one another by per&s;onal Calumny and Reproach. This I have often in print complain'd of as an unchri&s;tian, ungenerous and unju&s;tifiable Practice. Not a Word can be found in all I have written re|flecting on the Per&s;ons, or Conduct of any of the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
former Mini&s;try, I &s;erv'd Her Maje&s;ty under their Admini&s;tration, they acted honourably and ju&s;tly in every Tran&s;action in which I had the Honour to be concern'd with them; and I never publi&s;h'd, or &s;aid any thing di&s;honou|rable of any of them in my Life: Nor can the wor&s;t Enemy I have produce any &s;uch thing again&s;t me. I always regretted the Change, and look'd upon it as a great Di&s;a&s;ter to the Nation in general, I am &s;ure it was &s;o to me in particular; and the Divi&s;ions and Feuds among Parties, which follow'd that Change, were doubtle&s;s a Di&s;a&s;ter to us all.</P>
<P>The next Thing which follow'd the Change was THE PEACE: No Man can &s;ay that ever I once &s;aid in my Life, that I approv'd of the Peace. I wrote a publick Paper at that time, and there it Remains upon Record again&s;t me, I printed it openly, and that &s;o plainly, as others dur&s;t not do; That I did not like the Peace, neither that which was made, nor that which was before a making; That I I thought the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t was not taken care of in either; That the Peace I was for, was &s;uch as &s;hould neither have given the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> but that this Bone of Con|tention &s;hould have been broken to Pieces, that it &s;hould not have been dangerous to <HI>Eu|rope</HI> on any Account, and that the Prote&s;tant Powers, <HI>(viz.) Britain,</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> &s;hould have &s;o &s;trengthen'd and fortify'd their Intere&s;t by their &s;haring the Commerce and Strength of <HI>Spain,</HI> as &s;hould have made them no more afraid either of <HI>France,</HI> or the <HI>Emperor:</HI> So
<PB N="24" REF="26">
that the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t &s;hould have been &s;uperior to all the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> and been in no more Danger of exhorbitant Power, whether <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Au&s;trian.</HI> This was the Peace I always argued for, pur&s;uant to the De|&s;ign of King <HI>William</HI> in the Treaty of Parti|tion, and pur&s;uant to that Article of the Grand Alliance, which was directed by the &s;ame glorious Hand at the Beginning of this la&s;t War <HI>(viz.)</HI> That all we &s;hould conquer in the <HI>Spani&s;h-We&s;t-Indies</HI> &s;hould be our own.</P>
<P>This was with a true De&s;ign that <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hould have turn'd their Naval Power, which were eminently &s;uperiour to tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> to the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h-We&s;t-Indies,</HI> by which the Channel of Trade, and Return of Bullion, which now enriches the Enemies of both, had been ours; and as the Wealth, &s;o the Strength of the World had been in Prote&s;tant Hands. <HI>Spain,</HI> who|ever had it, mu&s;t then have been dependant upon us; the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> would have found it &s;o poor without us, as to be &s;carce worth fighting for; and the People &s;o aver&s;e to them for want of their Commerce, as not to make it ever likely <HI>France</HI> could keep it.</P>
<P>This was the Foundation I ever acted upon with relation to the Peace. It is true, that when it was made, and could not be other|wi&s;e, I thought our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to make the be&s;t of it, and rather to enquire what Im|provements were to be made of it, than to be continually exclaiming at tho&s;e who made it; and where the Objection lies again&s;t this Part I cannot yet &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
While I &s;poke of things in this manner, I bore infinite Reproaches from clamouring Pens of being in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, being hir'd and brib'd to defend a bad Peace, and the like; and mo&s;t of this was upon a Suppo&s;ition of my Writing, or being the Author of Abundance of Pamphlets which came out every Day, and which I had no hand in. And indeed, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve again by and by, this was one of the greate&s;t Pieces of Inju&s;tice that could be done me, and which I labour &s;till under without any redre&s;s; that whenever any Piece comes out which is not liked, I am immediately charg'd with being the Author, and very often the fir&s;t Knowledge I have had of a Books being publi&s;h'd, has been from &s;ee|ing my &s;elf abu&s;ed for being the Author of it, in &s;ome other Pamphlet publi&s;h'd in An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>Finding my &s;elf treated in this manner, I declin'd writing at all; and for a great Part of a Year never &s;et Pen to Paper, except in the publick Paper call'd the <HI>Review.</HI> After this I was long ab&s;ent in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and ob|&s;erving the In&s;olence of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, and how they in&s;inuated fine things into the Heads of the Common People of the Right and Claim of the <HI>Pretender</HI> and of the great Things he would do for us if he was to come in; of his being to turn a Prote&s;tant, of his being re|&s;olved to maintain our Liberties, &s;upport our Funds, give Liberty to Di&s;&s;enters, and the like; and finding that the People began to be deluded, and that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> gain'd ground among them by the&s;e In&s;inuations, I thought
<PB N="26" REF="28">
it the be&s;t Service I could do the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and the be&s;t way to open the Peoples Eyes to the Advantages of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, if I took &s;ome Cour&s;e effectually to alarm the People with what they really ought to expect if the <HI>Pretender</HI> &s;hould come to be King. And this made me &s;et Pen to Paper again.</P>
<P>And this brings me to the affirmative Part, or to what really I HAVE DONE; and in this I am &s;orry to &s;ay, I have one of the foule&s;t, mo&s;t unju&s;t, and unchri&s;tian Cla|mours to complain of, that any Man has &s;uffer'd, I believe, &s;ince the Days of the Ty|ranny of King <HI>James</HI> the Second. The Fact is thus.</P>
<P>In order to detect the Influence of <HI>Jacobite</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, as above, the fir&s;t thing I wrote was a &s;mall Tract, call'd, <HI>A Sea&s;onable Cau|tion.</HI></P>
<P>A Book &s;incerely written to open the Eyes of the poor ignorant
Country People, and to warn them again&s;t the &s;ubtle In&s;inuations of the Emi&s;&s;aries of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and that it might be effectual to that Purpo&s;e, I prevail'd with &s;everal of my Friends to give them away among the poor People all over <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in the <HI>North;</HI> and &s;everal thou&s;ands were actually given away, the Price being reduced &s;o low, that the bare Expence of Paper and Pre&s;s was only pre&s;erv'd, that every one might be convinc'd, that nothing of Gain was de|&s;ign'd, but a &s;incere Endeavour to do a publick Good, and a&s;&s;i&s;t to keep the People entirely in the Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
Next to this, and with the &s;ame &s;incere De|&s;ign, I wrote Two Pamphlets, one entituled, <HI>What if the</HI> Pretender <HI>&s;hould come?</HI> The other, <HI>Rea&s;ons again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Hanover. Nothing can be more plain, than that the Titles of the&s;e Books were Amu&s;e|ments, in order to put the Books into the Hands of tho&s;e People who the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had deluded, and to bring the Books to be read by them.</P>
<P>Previous to what I &s;hall farther &s;ay of the&s;e Books, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that all the&s;e Books met with &s;o general a Reception and Appro|bation among tho&s;e who were mo&s;t &s;incere for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, that they &s;ent them all over the Kingdom, and recommended them to the Peoples reading as excellent and u&s;eful Pieces, in&s;omuch, that about Seven Editions of them were Printed, and they were Re|printed in other Places; and I do prote&s;t, had his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, then Elector of <HI>Hano|ver,</HI> given me a thou&s;and Pounds to have writ|ten for the Intere&s;t of his Succe&s;&s;ion, and to expo&s;e and render the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> odious and ridiculous, I could have done no|thing more effectual to tho&s;e Purpo&s;es than the&s;e Books were.</P>
<P>And that I may make my wor&s;t Enemies, to whom this is a fair Appeal, Judges of this, I mu&s;t take leave by and by to repeat &s;ome of the Expre&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e Books which were direct, and need no Explication, and which, I think, no Man that was in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> nay which no Man but one who was entirely in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, could write.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
Nothing can be &s;everer in the Fate of a Man than to act &s;o between two Parties, that both Sides &s;hould be provok'd again&s;t him.

<P>On the other hand, I leave it to any con|&s;idering Man to Judge, what a Surprize it mu&s;t be to me to meet with all the pub|lick Clamour that Informers could invent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> being Guilty of writing again&s;t the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and as having written &s;everal Pam|phlets <HI>in Favour of the</HI> Pretender.</P>

<P>For the&s;e Books I was pro&s;ecuted, taken into Cu&s;tody, and oblig'd to give Eight hundred Pound Bail.</P>
<P>I do not in the lea&s;t object here again&s;t, or de&s;ign to reflect upon the Proceedings of the Judges which were &s;ub&s;equent to this; I ac|knowledg'd <HI>then,</HI> and <HI>now</HI> acknowledge <HI>again,</HI> that, upon the Information given, there was a &s;ufficient Ground for all they did, and my unhappy entring upon my own Vindication in Print, while the Ca&s;e was before their Lord|&s;hips in a Judicial Way, was an Error which I neither under&s;tood, and which I did not fore|&s;ee; and therefore, altho' I had great Rea&s;on to reflect upon the Informers, yet I was wrong in making that Defence in the Manner and Time I then made it, and which, when I found, I made no &s;cruple afterward to Peti|tion the Judges, and acknowledge, that they had ju&s;t Ground to re&s;ent it: Upon which Pe|tition and Acknowledgment, their Lord&s;hips were pleas'd, with particular Marks of Good|ne&s;s, to relea&s;e me, and not take the Advan|tage of an Error of Ignorance, as if it had been con&s;ider'd and premeditated.</P>

the Inju&s;tice of tho&s;e Writers, who, in many Pamphlets, charged me with writing for the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and the Government, with par|doning an Author who wrote for the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and indeed the Ju&s;tice of tho&s;e Men can be in nothing more clearly &s;tated, than in this Ca&s;e of mine; where the Charge, in their Printed Papers and Publick Di&s;cour&s;e was brought, not that they them&s;elves believ'd me Guilty of the Crime, but becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to blacken the Man; That a general Reproach might &s;erve for an An&s;wer to whatever he &s;hould &s;ay that was not for their Turn: So that it was the Per&s;on, not the Crime they fell upon, and they may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to per|&s;ecute for the &s;ake of Per&s;ecution, <HI>as will thus appear.</HI></P>
<P>This Matter making &s;ome Noi&s;e, People began to enquire into it, and to ask what <HI>De Foe</HI> was pro&s;ecuted for, &s;eeing the Books were manife&s;tly written again&s;t the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and for the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover?</HI> And my Friends expo&s;tulated freely with &s;ome of the Men who appear'd in it, who an&s;wer'd, <HI>with more Truth than Hone&s;ty,</HI> That they knew this Book had nothing in it, and that it was meant another way; but that <HI>De Foe</HI> had di&s;oblig'd them in other things, and they were re&s;olv'd to take the Advantage they had, both to pu|ni&s;h and expo&s;e him.

<P>What was the Sub&s;tance of the Indictment I &s;hall not mention here, neither could I enter upon it, having never &s;een the Particulars: But I was told, that I &s;hould be brought to Tryal the very next Term.</P>

But &s;uch is my pre&s;ent Fate, and I am to &s;ubmit to it, which I do with Meekne&s;s and Calmne&s;s, as to a Judgment from Heaven, and am practi&s;ing that Duty which I have &s;tudied long ago, of <HI>Forgiving my Enemies,</HI> and <HI>praying for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e me.</HI></P>
<P>Having given this brief Hi&s;tory of the Par|don, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I hope the Impartial part of the World will Grant me, That being thus Gra|ciou&s;ly Deliver'd a &s;econd Time from the Cru|elty of my Implacable Enemies, and the Ru|in of a Cruel and unju&s;t Per&s;ecution, and that by the meer Clemency and Goodne&s;s of the Queen, my Obligation to her Maje&s;ty's Good|ne&s;s, was far from being made le&s;s than it was before.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="41">
Nay, in a <HI>Review</HI> upon that Subject, while it was making I Printed it in plainer Words than other Men dur&s;t Speak it at that Time, That <HI>I did not like the Peace,</HI> nor did I like any Peace that was a making, &s;ince that of the PARTITION, and that the Prote&s;tant In|tere&s;t was not taken Care of either in that or the Treaty of <HI>Gertrudinburgh</HI> before it.</P>
<P>It is true, that I did &s;ay, That &s;ince the Peace was made, and we could not help it, that it was our Bu&s;ine&s;s and our Duty to make the be&s;t of it, to make the utmo&s;t Advantage of it by Commerce, Navigation, and all kind of Improvement that we could, and this I SAY STILL; and I mu&s;t think it is more our Duty to do &s;o, than the Exclamations again&s;t the thing it &s;elf which it is not in our power to Retrieve.

<P>This way of Arguing was either &s;o little Under&s;tood, or &s;o much Malign'd, that I &s;uf|fer'd innumerable Reproaches in Print, for having Written for a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which was neither in the Expre&s;&s;ion, or ever in my Imagination: But I pa&s;s by the&s;e Inju|ries as &s;mall and trifling compar'd to others <HI>I</HI> &s;uffer under.</P>
<P>However one thing <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t &s;ay of the Peace, <HI>Let it be Good or Ill in its &s;elf,</HI> I cannot but think we have all rea&s;on to Rejoyce in behalf of his Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, That at his acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, He found the Nation in Peace; and had the Hands of the King of <HI>France</HI> tied up by a Peace, &s;o as not to be able, without the mo&s;t infamous breach of Articles, to offer the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance to his taking a Quiet and Lei&s;urely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or &s;o much as to Countenance tho&s;e that would.</P>

<P>It may be Objected to me, That they might be in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender for all that: <HI>It is true they might;</HI> But that is nothing to me, <HI>I</HI> am not Vindicating their Conduct, but my own; as <HI>I</HI> never was Employ'd in any thing that way, &s;o <HI>I</HI> do &s;till prote&s;t, <HI>I</HI> do not believe it was ever in their De&s;ign, and <HI>I</HI> have many Rea&s;ons to confirm my Thoughts in that Ca&s;e, which are not material to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: But be that as it will, it is enough to me that <HI>I</HI> acted nothing in any &s;uch Intere&s;t, neither did <HI>I</HI> ever Sin again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hanover</HI> in Thought, Word, or Deed; and if the Mini&s;try did, <HI>I</HI> did not &s;ee it, or &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect them of it.</P>
<P>It was a Di&s;a&s;ter to the Mini&s;try, to be dri|ven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking that Set of Men by the hand, who, no body can deny, were
<PB N="42" REF="44">
in that Intere&s;t: But as the former Mini&s;try an&s;wer'd, when they were charg'd with a De|&s;ign to overthrow the Church, becau&s;e they favour'd, joyn'd with, and were united to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> I &s;ay they an&s;wer'd, <HI>That they made u&s;e of the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>but granted them no|thing</HI> (WHICH BY THE WAY WAS TOO TRUE:) So the&s;e Gentlemen An&s;wer, <HI>That it is true, they made u&s;e of</HI> Jacobites, <HI>but did nothing for them.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>this by the by.</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity is pleaded by both Parties for doing things which neither Side can ju&s;tify. I wi&s;h both Sides would for ever avoid the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing Evil; for certainly it is the wor&s;t Plea in the World, and generally made u&s;e of for the wor&s;t Things.</P>
<P>I have often lamented the Di&s;a&s;ter which I &s;aw, employing <HI>Jacobites,</HI> was to the late Mi|ni&s;try, and certainly it gave the greate&s;t Han|dle to the Enemies of the Mini&s;try to fix that univer&s;al Reproach upon them of being in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender:</HI> But there was no Medium. The <HI>Whigs</HI> refu&s;ed to &s;hew them a &s;afe Retreat, or to give them the lea&s;t Op|portunity to take any other Mea&s;ures but at the Ri&s;que of their own De&s;truction; and they ventur'd upon that Cour&s;e, in hopes of being able to &s;tand alone at la&s;t without help of ei|ther the one or the other, in which no doubt they were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>However, in this Part, as I was always a&s;|&s;ur'd, and have good Rea&s;on &s;till to believe, that her Maje&s;ty was &s;teady in the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and that nothing was
<PB N="43" REF="45">
ever offer'd to me, or requir'd of me to the Prejudice of that Intere&s;t, On what Ground can I be reproach'd with the &s;ecret re&s;erv'd De&s;igns of any, if they had &s;uch De&s;igns as I &s;till verily believe they had not?</P>
<P>I &s;ee there are &s;ome Men who would fain per&s;wade the World, that every Man that was in the Intere&s;t of the late Mini&s;try, or em|ploy'd by the late Government, or that &s;erv'd the late Queen, was for the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>God forbid this &s;hould be true; and I think there needs very little to be &s;aid in An&s;wer to it. I can an&s;wer for my &s;elf, that it is noto|riou&s;ly fal&s;e; and I think the ea&s;y and unin|terrupted Acce&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty to the Crown contradicts it: I &s;ee no End which &s;uch a Sugge&s;tion aims at, but to leave an Odi|um upon all that had any Duty or Regard to her late Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>A Subject is not always Ma&s;ter of his Sove|reign's Mea&s;ures, nor always to examine what Per&s;ons or Parties the Prince he &s;erves Em|ploys; &s;o be it that they break not in upon the Con&s;titution; that they govern accord|ing to Law, and that he is employ'd in no illegal Act, or have nothing de&s;ir'd of him in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Liberties and Laws of his Country: If this be not right, then a Servant of the King's is in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e than a Servant to any private Per&s;on.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e things I have not err'd, neither have I acted or done any thing in the whole Cour&s;e of my Life, either in the Service of her Maje&s;ty, or of her Mini&s;try, that any one can &s;ay has the lea&s;t Deviation from the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="46">
Regard to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and to the Laws and Liberties of my Country.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw an Arbitrary Action offer'd at, a Law di&s;pens'd with, Ju&s;tice deny'd, or Op|pre&s;&s;ion &s;et up, either by Queen or Mini&s;try, in any Branch of the Admini&s;tration, wherein I had the lea&s;t Concern.</P>
<P>If I have &s;in'd again&s;t the <HI>Whigs,</HI> it has been all NEGATIVELY, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that I have not joyn'd in the loud Exclamations again&s;t the Queen, and again&s;t the Mini&s;try, and again&s;t the Mea&s;ures; and if this be my Crime, my Plea is twofold.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I did not really &s;ee Cau&s;e for carrying their Complaints to that violent Degree.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Where I did &s;ee what, as before, I la|mented and was &s;orry for, and could not joyn with, or approve, as joyning with <HI>Jacobites,</HI> the <HI>Peace,</HI> &amp;c. My Obligation is my Plea for my &s;ilence.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I have all the good Thoughts of the Per&s;on, and good Wi&s;hes for the Pro&s;perity of my Benefactor, that Charity, and that Gratitude, can in&s;pire me with: I ever believ'd him to have the true Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, and of his Country in his view; if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould be very &s;orry. And I mu&s;t repeat it again, that he always left me &s;o entirely to my own Judgment in every thing I did, that he never pre&s;crib'd to me what I &s;hould write, or &s;hould not write in my Life; neither did he ever concern him|&s;elf
<PB N="45" REF="47">
to dictate to, or re&s;train me in any kind; nor did he &s;ee any one Tract that I ever wrote before it was Printed: So that all the Notion of my writing by his Direction, is as much a Slander upon him, as it is po&s;&s;ible any thing of that kind can be; and if I have written any thing which is offen&s;ive, unju&s;t, or untrue, I mu&s;t do that Ju&s;tice as to declare, He has had no hand in it; the Crime is my own.</P>
<P>As the Reproach of his directing me to write, is a Slander UPON THE PERSON I am &s;peaking of; &s;o that of my receiving Pen|&s;ions and Payments from him for writing, is a Slander UPON ME; and I &s;peak it with the greate&s;t Sincerity, Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and So|lemnity that it is po&s;&s;ible for a Chri&s;tian Man to &s;peak, That except the Appointment I men|tion'd before, which her Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to make me formerly, and which I receiv'd during the time of my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s Mi|ni&s;try, I have not receiv'd of the late Lord Trea&s;urer, or of any one el&s;e by his Order, Knowledge, or Direction, one Farthing, or the Value of a Farthing, during his whole Ad|mini&s;tration; nor has all the Intere&s;t I have been &s;uppos'd to have in his Lord&s;hip, been able to procure me the Arrears due to me in the time of the other Mini&s;try. SO HELP ME GOD.</P>
<P>I am under no Nece&s;&s;ity of making this De|claration. The Services I did, and for which her Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to make me a &s;mall Allowance, are known to the greate&s;t Men in the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration; and &s;ome of them were then of the Opinion, and I hope
<PB N="46" REF="48">
are &s;o &s;till, that I was not unworthy of her Maje&s;ty's Favour. The Effect of tho&s;e Ser|vices, however &s;mall, are enjoy'd by tho&s;e Great Per&s;ons, and by the whole Nation to this Day; and I had the Honour once to be told, <HI>That they &s;hould never be forgotten.</HI> It is a Misfortune, that no Man can avoid, to for|feit for his Deference to the Per&s;on and Ser|vices of his Queen, to whom he was inex|pre&s;&s;ibly oblig'd: And if I am fallen under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the PRESENT Government, for any thing I ever did in Obedience to her Maje&s;ty in THE PAST, I may &s;ay it is my Di&s;a&s;ter; but I can never &s;ay it is my Fault.</P>
<P>This brings me again to that other Oppre&s;&s;ion which as I &s;aid I &s;uffer under, and which, I think, is of a Kind, that no Man ever &s;uffer'd under &s;o much as my &s;elf: And this is to have every Libel, every Pamphlet, be it ever &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o malicious, &s;o unmannerly, or &s;o dangerous, be laid at my Door, and be call'd publickly by my Name. It has been in vain for me to &s;trug|gle with this Injury; It has been in vain for me to prote&s;t, to declare &s;olemnly, nay, if I would have &s;worn that I had no hand in &s;uch a Book, or Paper, never &s;aw it, never read it, and the like, it was the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>My Name has been hackney'd about the Street by the Hawkers, and about the Coffee-Hou&s;es by the Politicians, at &s;uch a rate, as no Patience could bear. One Man will &s;wear to the Style; another to this or that Expre&s;&s;ion; another to the Way of Printing; and all &s;o po&s;itive, that it is to no purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">
I publi&s;h'd once, to &s;top this way of u&s;ing me, that I would Print nothing but what I &s;et my Name to, and I held it for a Year or Two; but it was all one, I had the &s;ame Treatment. I now have re&s;olv'd, for &s;ome time, to write nothing at all; and yet I find it the &s;ame thing. Two Books lately pub|li&s;h'd being call'd mine, for no other rea&s;on that I know of, than that, at the Reque&s;t of the Printer, I revi&s;ed two Sheets of them at the Pre&s;s, and that they &s;eem'd to be written in Favour of a certain Per&s;on; which Per&s;on al&s;o, as I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, had no Hand in them, or any Knowledge of them, till they were publi&s;h'd in Print.</P>
<P>This is a Flail which I have no Fence again&s;t, but to complain of the Inju&s;tice of it, and that is but <HI>the &s;horte&s;t Way</HI> to be treated with more Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There is a mighty Charge again&s;t me for being Author and Publi&s;her of a Paper call'd, <HI>The MERCATOR.</HI> I'll &s;tate the Fact fir&s;t, and then &s;peak to the Subject.</P>
<P>It is true, that being de&s;ir'd to give my Opinion in the Affair of the Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> I did, as I often had done in Print many Years before, declare, That it was my Opinion we ought to have an open Trade with <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e I did believe we might have the Advantage by &s;uch a Trade; and of this Opinion I am &s;till. What Part I had in the <HI>Mercator,</HI> is well known; and would Men An&s;wer with Argument, and not with per&s;o|nal Abu&s;es, I would, at any time, defend eve|ry Part of the <HI>Mercator</HI> which was of my do|ing.
<PB N="48" REF="50">
But to &s;ay the <HI>Mercator</HI> was mine, is fal&s;e; I neither was the Author of it, had the Property of it, the Printing of it, or the Profit by it. I had never any Payment or Reward for writing any Part of it; Nor had I the Power to put what I would into it: Yet the whole Clamour fell upon me, becau&s;e they knew not who el&s;e to load with it. And when they came to An&s;wer, the Method was, in&s;tead of Argument, to threaten, and reflect upon me; reproach me with private Circum|&s;tances and Misfortunes, and give Language which no Chri&s;tian ought to give, and which no Gentleman ought to take.</P>
<P>I thought any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> had the Liberty to &s;peak his Opinion in &s;uch things; for this had nothing to do with the Publick. The Pre&s;s was open to me as well as to others; and how, or when I lo&s;t my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty of &s;peaking my Mind, I know not; neither how my &s;peak|ing my Opinion without Fee or Reward could authorize them to call me Villain, Ra&s;cal, Tray|tor, and &s;uch opprobious Names.</P>
<P>It was ever my Opinion, and is &s;o &s;till, that were our Wooll kept from <HI>France,</HI> and our Ma|nufactures &s;pread in <HI>France</HI> upon rea&s;onable Du|ties, all the Improvement which the <HI>French</HI> have made in Woolen Manufactures would de|cay, and in the End be little Worth, and con|&s;equently the Hurt they could do us by them, would be of little Moment.</P>
<P>It was my Opinion, and is &s;o &s;till, that the Ninth Article of the Treaty of <HI>Commerce</HI> was calculated for the Advantage of our Trade, let who will make it, <HI>that is nothing to me:</HI> My
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Rea&s;ons are, becau&s;e it TYED up the <HI>French</HI> to open the Door to our Manufactures at a certain Duty of Importation THERE, and left the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> at Liberty to &s;hut theirs out by as high Duties as they pleas'd HERE, there being no Limitation upon us as to Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods; <HI>but that other Na|tions &s;hould pay the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>While the <HI>French</HI> were thus bound, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> free, I always thought we mu&s;t be in a Condition to Trade to Advantage, or it mu&s;t be our own Fault: This was my Opinion, and IS SO STILL, and I would venture to main|tain it again&s;t any Man upon a publick Stage, before a Jury of fifty Merchants, and venture my Life upon the Cau&s;e, if I were a&s;&s;ured of fair Play in the Di&s;pute. But that it was my Opini|on, That we might carry on a Trade with <HI>France</HI> to our great Advantage, and that we ought for that rea&s;on to Trade with them, ap|pears in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Volume of the <HI>Reviews,</HI> above Nine Year before the <HI>Mercator</HI> was thought of; it was not thought Criminal to &s;ay &s;o then, how it comes to be Villainous to &s;ay &s;o now God knows, I can give no account of it; I am &s;till of the &s;ame Opinion, and &s;hall never be brought to &s;ay o|therwi&s;e, unle&s;s I &s;ee the &s;tate of Trade &s;o altered, as to alter my Opinion; and if ever I do, I will be able to give good Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to the&s;e things, whether mine or no, was all pointed at me, and the Arguments were generally in the Terms of Villain, Ra&s;cal, Mi&s;creant, Lyer, Bankrupt, Fellow, Hireling,
<PB N="50" REF="52">
Turn-Coat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> what the Arguments were better'd by the&s;e Methods, that I leave to others to Judge of. Al&s;o mo&s;t of tho&s;e things in the <HI>Mercator,</HI> for which I had &s;uch U&s;age, were &s;uch as I was not the Author of.</P>
<P>I do grant, had all the Books which have been called by my Name been written by me, I mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have exa&s;perated every Side, and perhaps have de&s;erved it; but I have the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice imaginable in this Treatment, as I have in the perverting the De|&s;ign of what really I have written. To &s;um up therefore my Complaint in few Words:</P>
<P>I was from my fir&s;t entring into the Know|ledge of publick Matters, and have ever been to this Day, a &s;incere Lover of the Con&s;titution of my Country; zealous for Liberty, and the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; but a con&s;tant Follower of moderate Principles, a vigorous Oppo&s;er of hot Mea&s;ures in all Parties: I never once changed my Opinion, my Principles, or my Party; and let what will be &s;aid of changing Sides, this I maintain, That I never once de|viated from the Revolution Principles, nor from the Doctrine of Liberty and Property, on which it was founded.</P>
<P>I own I could never be convinc'd of the great <HI>Danger</HI> of the PRETENDER, in the Time of the late Mini&s;try: Nor can I be now convinc'd of the great <HI>Danger</HI> of the CHURCH under this Mini&s;try. I believe the Cries of one was politically made u&s;e of then to &s;erve other De&s;igns; and I plainly &s;ee the like U&s;e made of the other now. I &s;poke my Mind freely then, and I have done the like
<PB N="51" REF="53">
now, in a &s;mall Tract to that purpo&s;e not yet made publick; and which, if I live to publi&s;h, I will publickly own, as I purpo&s;e to do, every thing I write, that my Friends may know when I am abu&s;ed, and they impos'd on.</P>
<P>It has been the Di&s;a&s;ter of all Parties in this Nation to be very HOT in their Turn, and as often as they have been SO, I have differed with them all, and ever mu&s;t and &s;hall do &s;o. I'll repeat &s;ome of the Occa&s;ions on the <HI>Whigs</HI> Side, becau&s;e from that Quarter the Accu&s;ation of my turning about comes.</P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t Time</HI> I had the Misfortune to differ with my Friends, was about the Year 1683. when the <HI>Turks</HI> were be&s;ieging <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> and the <HI>Whigs</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> generally &s;peak|ing, were for the <HI>Turks</HI> taking it; which I ha|ving read the Hi&s;tory of the Cruelty and per|fidious Dealings of the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Wars, and how they had rooted out the Name of the Chri&s;tian Religion in above Three&s;core and Ten Kingdoms, could by no means agree with: And tho' then but a young Man, and a younger Author, I oppo&s;ed it, and wrote again&s;t it; which was taken very unkindly indeed.</P>
<P><HI>The next Time</HI> I differed with my Friends was when King <HI>James</HI> was wheedling the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to take off the Penal Laws and Te&s;t, which I could by no means come into: And as <HI>in the fir&s;t</HI> I u&s;ed to &s;ay, I had rather the Popi&s;h Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;hould ruin the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> than the Infidel Hou&s;e of <HI>Ottoman</HI> &s;hould ruin both Prote&s;tant and Papi&s;t, by over-running <HI>Germany;</HI> So in the
<PB N="52" REF="54">
other, I told the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> I had rather th Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould pull our Cloaths off by Fines and Forfeitures, than the Papi&s;ts &s;hould fall both upon the <HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI> and pull our Skins off by Fire and Fagot.</P>
<P><HI>The next</HI> Difference I had with good Men, was about the &s;candalous Practice of <HI>Oc|ca&s;ional Conformity,</HI> in which I had the Misfor|tune to make many hone&s;t Men angry, rather becau&s;e I had the better of the Argument, than becau&s;e they di&s;liked what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>And now I have lived to &s;ee the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> them&s;elves very quiet, if not very well plea&s;ed with an Act of Parliament to prevent it. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">iends indeed laid it on; they would be Friends indeed if they would talk of taking it off again.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> I had a Breach with hone&s;t Men for their Male treating King <HI>William;</HI> of which I &s;ay nothing: Becau&s;e, I think, they are now opening their Eyes, and making what amends they can to his Memory.</P>
<P><HI>The fifth</HI> Difference I had with them, was about the <HI>Treaty of Partition,</HI> in which many hone&s;t Men were mi&s;taken, and in which I told them plainly then, That they would at la&s;t End the War upon <HI>wor&s;e Terms;</HI> and &s;o it is my Opinion they would have done, tho' the Treaty of <HI>Gertrudenburgh</HI> had taken Place.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ixth Time</HI> I differed with them, was when the <HI>Old Whigs</HI> fell upon the <HI>Modern Whigs;</HI> and when the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> and my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> were u&s;ed by the <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI> in a Manner wor&s;e, <HI>I mu&s;t confe&s;s for the Time it</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="55">
<HI>la&s;ted,</HI> than ever they were u&s;ed &s;ince; nay, tho' it were by <HI>Abel</HI> and the <HI>Examiner:</HI> But the Succe&s;s failed. In this Di&s;pute my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> did me the Honour to tell me, <HI>I had &s;erved him</HI> and <HI>his Grace al&s;o,</HI> both <HI>faithfully</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;sfully.</HI> But his Lord&s;hip is Dead, and I have now no Te&s;timony of it but what is to be found in the <HI>Ob&s;ervator,</HI> where I am plenti|fully abu&s;ed for being an Enemy to my Coun|try, by acting in the Intere&s;t of my Lord <HI>Go|dolphin,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough: What Weather-Cock can Turn with &s;uch Tempers as the&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>I am now in <HI>the &s;eventh</HI> Breach with them, and my Crime now is, That I will not believe and &s;ay the &s;ame things of the <HI>Queen,</HI> and the late <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> which I could not believe be|fore of my Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and which in Truth I cannot believe, and therefore could not &s;ay it of either of them; and which, if I had believed, yet I ought not to have been the Man that &s;hould have &s;aid it, for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>In &s;uch Turns of Tempers and Times a Man mu&s;t be tenfold <HI>a Vicar of</HI> Bray, or it is impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t one Time or other be out with every Body. This is my pre&s;ent Condition, and for this I am reviled with having abandon'd my Principles, turn'd <HI>Jaco|bite,</HI> and what not: God Judge between me and the&s;e Men. Would they come to any Particulars with me, what real Guilt I may have I would freely acknowledge; and if they would produce any Evidence, of the Bribes, the Pen&s;ions, and the Rewards I have taken,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
I would declare hone&s;tly, whether they were true or no. If they would give a Li&s;t of the Books which they charge me with, and the Rea&s;ons why they lay them at my Door, I would acknowledge any Mi&s;take, own what I have done, and let them know what I have not done. But the&s;e Men neither &s;hew Mercy, or leave place for Repentance, in which they act not only unlike their Maker, but contrary to his expre&s;s Commands.</P>
<P>It is true, good Men have been u&s;ed thus in former times; and all the Comfort I have is, that the&s;e Men have not the la&s;t Judgment in their Hands, if they had, dreadful would be the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them. But that Day will &s;hew many Men and Things al&s;o in a different State from what they may now ap|pear in; &s;ome that now appear clear and fair, will then be &s;een to be black and foul; and &s;ome that are now thought black and foul, will then be approved and accepted; and thither I chear|fully appeal, concluding this Part in the Words of the Prophet, <HI>I heard the Defaming of many; Fear on every &s;ide; Report,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and we will Report it; All my Familiars watch'd for my halting, &s;aying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we &s;hall prevail again&s;t him, and we &s;hall take our Revenge on him,</HI> Jerem. 20. 10.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pool's Annotations</HI> has the following Re|marks on the&s;e Lines, which, I think, are &s;o much to that Part of my Ca&s;e which is to follow, that I could not omit them. His Words are the&s;e.</P>

Prophet; his Ears were continually filled with the Obloquies and Reproaches of &s;uch as reproached him; and be&s;ides, lie was afraid on all Hands, there were &s;o many Traps laid for him, &s;o many Devi&s;es devi&s;ed again&s;t him. They did not only take Advan|tage again&s;t him, but &s;ought Advantages, and invited others to rai&s;e Stories of him. Not only Strangers, but tho&s;e that he might have expected the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s from; tho&s;e that pretended mo&s;t courteou&s;ly, they watch, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for opportunities to do me Mi&s;chief, and lay in wait for my Halting, de&s;iring nothing more than that I might be enticed to &s;peak, or do &s;omething which they might find Mat|ter of a colourable Accu&s;ation, that &s;o they might &s;atisfie their Malice upon me. This hath always been the Genius of wicked Men; <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> both made Complaints much like this.'</Q> The&s;e are Mr. <HI>Pool's</HI> Words.</P>
<P>And this leads me to &s;everal Particulars, in which my Ca&s;e may, without any Arrogance, be likened to that of the Sacred Prophet; ex|cept only the va&s;t Di&s;parity of the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Queen Dead, and the King as Right required, proclaim'd, but the Rage of Men encrea&s;ed upon me to that Degree, that the Threats and In&s;ults I receiv'd were &s;uch as I am not able to expre&s;s: If I offered to &s;ay a word in favour of the pre&s;ent Settle|ment, it was called fawning and turning round again; on the other hand, tho' I have meddled neither one way or other, nor written one Book &s;ince the Queen's Death, yet a great ma|ny things are call'd by my Name, and I bear
<PB N="56" REF="58">
every Day the Reproaches which all the An|&s;werers of tho&s;e Books ca&s;t as well upon the Sub|ject as the Authors. I have not &s;een or &s;poken to my Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI> but once &s;ince the King's Landing, nor receiv'd the lea&s;t Me&s;&s;age, Order, or Writing from his Lord&s;hip, or any other way Corre&s;ponded with him, yet he bears the Reproach of my Writing in his Defence, and I the Rage of Men for doing it. I cannot &s;ay it is no Affliction to me to be thus u&s;ed, tho' my being entirely clear of the Facts, is a true &s;upport to me.</P>
<P>I am unconcerned at the Rage and Clamour of <HI>Party-men;</HI> but I can not be unconcern'd to hear Men, who I think are good Men and good Chri&s;tians, prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd and mi&s;taken about me: However I cannot doubt but &s;ome time or other It will plea&s;e God to open &s;uch Mens Eyes. A con&s;tant, &s;teady adhering to <HI>Per|&s;onal Vertue,</HI> and to <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> which, I thank God, I can appeal to him, has always been my Practice; will AT LAST re&s;tore me to the Opinion of Sober and Impartial Men, and that is all I de&s;ire: What it will do with tho&s;e who are re&s;olutely Partial and Un|ju&s;t I cannot &s;ay, neither is that much my Concern. But I cannot forbear giving one Example of the hard Treatment I receive, which has happened, even while I am Writing this Tract: I have &s;ix Children, I have Edu|cated them as well as my Circum&s;tances will permit, and &s;o as I hope &s;hall recommed them to better U&s;age than their Father meets with in the World. I am not indebted One Shil|ling in the World for any part of their Edu|cation,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
or for any thing el&s;e belonging to bringing them up; yet the Author of the <HI>Flying-Po&s;t</HI> Publi&s;hed lately, That I never pay'd for the Education of any of my Chil|dren. If an Man in <HI>Britain</HI> has a Shilling to demand of me for any part of their Educa|tion, or any thing belong to them, let them come for it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Men care not what Injurious Things they Write, nor what they Say, whe|ther Truth or Not, if it may but rai&s;e a Re|proach on me, tho' it were to be my Ruine. I may well Appeal to the Honour and Ju&s;tice of my wor&s;t Enemies in &s;uch Ca&s;es as this.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION by the Publi&s;her.</HEAD>
<P>WHile this was at the Pre&s;s, and the Co|py thus far fini&s;h'd, the Author was &s;eiz'd with a violent Fit of an Apoplexy, whereby he was di&s;abled fini&s;hing what he de|&s;ign'd in his farther Defence, and continuing now for above Six Weeks in a Weak and Langui&s;hing Condition, neither able to go on, or likely to recover, at lea&s;t in any &s;hort time, his Friends thought it not fit to delay the Publication of this any longer; if he recovers, he may be able to fini&s;h what he began; if not, it is the Opinion of mo&s;t that know him, that the Treatment which he here complains of, and &s;ome others that he would have &s;poken of, have been the apparent Cau&s;e of his Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
