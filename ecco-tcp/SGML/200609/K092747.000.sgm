<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent Volume pretends to no other
merit, than that of being a laborious &s;election
of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of the various
ANA. To the&s;e valuable &s;tores of Literature
I have added &s;ome Anecdotes, which appeared
to me amu&s;ive and curious; and &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations,
which, I hope, will not be deemed im|pertinent.</P>
<P>The ANA form a body of Literature not
univer&s;ally known. It may, therefore, be u&s;e|ful
to inform the reader, that in the early part
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
of the la&s;t century, it was prevailing cu&s;tom
to take down for publication the Conver&s;ations,
or '<HI>Table-Talk,</HI>' as they have been &s;ometimes
called, of the mo&s;t eminent Wits and Scholars.
To &s;atisfy the demands of Famine, rather than
tho&s;e of Literature, &s;ome men were prompted to
&s;ell their Collections to the Book&s;ellers; and it
may be fairly pre&s;umed, were le&s;s attentive
to the richne&s;s of the materials then to the
number of pages they were calculated to fill.
Others publi&s;hed them at the death of a va|lued
Friend, to di&s;play the extent of his &s;cience,
or the felicity of his genius; and it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that even the&s;e were not &s;o &s;crupulous
as they &s;hould have been of what they ad|mitted
into their Collections.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5">
Had &s;uch Repo&s;itories of Literature been
judiciou&s;ly formed, they would, have proved
a valuable acqui&s;ition to the Republic
of Letters: but their re&s;pective Compilers
have evinced great inattention, or little di&s;|cernment;
nothing was di&s;criminated in the
ma&s;s of their materials; they appear to have
li&s;tened to the mouth of the Scholar who&s;e
&s;entiments they record, as the credulous Enthu|&s;ia&s;t
did in ancient times to the Oracle he wor|&s;hipped.
Thus, whatever was unintelligible,
ob&s;cure, or even fal&s;e, was held by the&s;e Lite|rary
Devotees in as great reverence as it's op|po&s;ite.</P>
<P>It has been repeatedly urged, and allowed,
that the matter of elaborate Treati&s;es, and even
ponderous Volumes, may not infrequently be
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
comprized in conci&s;e E&s;&s;ays, or &s;hort Remarks.
Some things of this kind are attempted in the
pre&s;ent Volume; and I have been prompted
towards it's publication, by a conviction that
it will furni&s;h much u&s;eful information to the
generality of readers.</P>
<P>It is not ju&s;t, however, that curio&s;ity &s;hould
be rai&s;ed too high. If expectations are formed,
which are impo&s;&s;ible to be gratified, abilities
infinitely &s;uperior to mine mu&s;t be humbled.
All the Anecdotes I offer will not be new: of
&s;ome, I pretend only to remind the reader; but
the greater part, I have frequently been tempted
to believe, will appear intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hionable and commercial world are
too much occupied to attend to &s;erious di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion
and &s;cientific re&s;earch: the one labori|ou&s;ly
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
occupied in doing nothing, and the other
indefatigable in doing every thing. To the
literary labourer they leave the cultivation of
the fields and the gardens of Literature: they
are willing to purcha&s;e the productions of his
talents; but they expect to receive only the fruits
and the flowers. To &s;uch, who form indeed the
generality of readers, it is pre&s;umed, the pre|&s;ent
Collection will not be found unu&s;eful.
Whatever is mo&s;t intere&s;ting in books rarely to
be met with, or whatever is mo&s;t agreeable in
compilations which it would be impo&s;&s;ible for
them to peru&s;e with patience, is here &s;elected:
and, if it is not pre&s;umptuous to add, the Man
of Letters, at the &s;ame time, may be reminded
of important Ob&s;ervations, &s;triking Anecdotes,
and attic Plea&s;antries; which, however they
<PB N="x" REF="8">
de&s;erve to be retained, will, without &s;ome Vade
Mecum of this kind, &s;oon e&s;cape from the
mo&s;t tenacious memory. In a word, if this
Collection an&s;wers the hopes of the Editor,
it will be found a Mi&s;cellany not unamu&s;ive
to the Literary Lounger.</P>
<P>As I have acknowledged that this Volume con|tains,
for the mo&s;t part, only a Collection from
the Works of others, &s;ome Ari&s;tarchus may &s;a|gaciou&s;ly
di&s;cover, that it is not difficult to
make books in this manner. With this I
&s;hall agree. But it will be admitted, that it
has co&s;t &s;ome care and &s;ome labour to collect
the&s;e materials. Should the u&s;eful and the
agreeable be found blended, I believe the
Public care little whether the Author has
written every &s;entence him&s;elf; or, like me,
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
&s;tands deeply indebted to the works of other
Writers.</P>
<P>To improve an arrangement which is not al|ways
&s;o perfect as I could wi&s;h, I have added a
copious INDEX: each Article al&s;o is titled, &s;o
that wherever the book is opened, the &s;ubject
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed immediately appears.</P>
<P>To be u&s;eful, and to plea&s;e the Public, is my
de&s;ign. My Work is not adapted to extend,
or to be&s;tow, reputation: it is &s;ufficient, if it
attains it's humble preten&s;ion. A multifarious
Collection of this kind &s;tands in great need of
Critical Candour: yet I &s;hould feel my&s;elf
little &s;olicitous concerning it's reception, if I
were certain that the urbanity of the Critic was
to dicide it's fate.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS, Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, hav|ing
written, that there exi&s;ted Anti|podes;
Boniface, Archbi&s;hop of Mayence, the
Pope's Legate, declared him a heretic, and
con&s;igned him to the flames.</P>
<P>Galileo, becau&s;e he believed in the Copernican
Sy&s;tem, now univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, was con|demned
at Rome publicly to di&s;avow &s;entiments
the truth of which mu&s;t have been to him
abundantly manife&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="15">
The mo&s;t valued of Gabriel Naud&eacute;'s works
is his Apology for tho&s;e great Men who have
been accu&s;ed of Magic. In that book, he has
recorded a melancholy number of the mo&s;t
eminent &s;cholars, who have found, that to have
been &s;ucce&s;sful in their &s;tudies, was a &s;ucce&s;s
which harra&s;&s;ed them with a continued per&s;e|cution,
that &s;ometimes led them into the pri&s;on,
and &s;ometimes bound them to the &s;take.</P>
<P>Urb&eacute; Grandier, for who&s;e life, replete with
intere&s;ting anecdote, I refer the reader to
Bayle, was burnt alive through the machina|tions
of a rival, who formed a con&s;piracy
again&s;t this amiable and unfortunate &s;cholar,
by contriving to get the depo&s;itions of &s;ome
nuns to prove the crime of magic. The&s;e wo|men
mu&s;t have been guilty of the mo&s;t horrid
perjuries.</P>
<P>Cornelius Agrippa was nece&s;&s;itated to fly his
country, and the enjoyments of a rich income,
merely for having di&s;played a few philo&s;ophical
experiments which now every &s;chool-boy can
<PB N="3" REF="16">
perform. The people beheld him as an object
of horror; and not infrequently, when he
walked the &s;treets, he found them empty at
his approach. He died, of di&s;ea&s;e and famine,
in an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent day, when the lights of philo|&s;ophy
have become &s;o generally expanded, we
perceive the little foundation of all the&s;e accu&s;a|tions
of magic. What a dreadful chain mu&s;t
there have been of perjuries and con&s;piracies!
One is willing to imagine, for the honour of
human nature, that &s;o deep a malignity, and
&s;o &s;edate a cruelty, could not have tainted the
heart of men; but the &s;imple recital of hi&s;tory
forms, too often, the &s;evere&s;t &s;atire on human
nature.</P>
<P>Our great Roger Bacon, by a degree of pene|tration
which perhaps has never been equalled,
di&s;covered &s;ome of the mo&s;t occult &s;ecrets in
Nature. She &s;eems, indeed&mdash;if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s
my&s;elf&mdash;to have &s;tood naked before him.
His honours have been &s;tolen from him by
<PB N="4" REF="17">
more modern authors, who have appeared in|ventors
when they were copying Bacon. Yet,
for the reward of all his inten&s;e &s;tudies, the
holy brethren, and the infallible Maje&s;ty of
Rome, occa&s;ioned him to langui&s;h in pri&s;on
during the greater part of his life.</P>
<P>The catalogue of the Per&s;ecuted Learned is
indeed voluminous. We need not wa&s;te our
tears on fictitious &s;orrows, while the remem|brance
of the&s;e men &s;hall exi&s;t!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>FRIAR BACON.</HEAD>
<P>MY zeal for the memory of this illu&s;trious
&s;cholar impels me to tran&s;cribe, which it will
be found I &s;eldom do, from a book that is in
every body's hands. From the faithful and
laborious Henry, have I collected what follows
concerning Roger Bacon&mdash;</P>
<P>' We cannot but lament that Friar Bacon
met with &s;o many di&s;couragements in the pur|&s;uit
of u&s;eful knowledge. If he had lived in
<PB N="5" REF="18">
better times, or if he had even been permitted
to pro&s;ecute that cour&s;e of enquiries and expe|riments
in which he engaged after his return
from Paris, it is highly probable that the world
would have many valuable di&s;coveries that are
&s;till unknown.</P>
<P>' An excellent modern writer, Dr. Friend,
having enumerated &s;ome of Bacon's di&s;coveries,
adds&mdash;"The&s;e are wonderful di&s;coveries for a
man to make in &s;o ignorant an age, who had
no ma&s;ter to teach him, but &s;truck it all out of
his own brain: but it is &s;till more wonderful
that &s;uch di&s;coveries &s;hould lie &s;o long con|cealed;
till, in the next &s;ucceeding centuries,
other people &s;hould &s;tart up, and lay claim to
tho&s;e very inventions to which Bacon alone
had a right."</P>
<P>' Bacon di&s;covered the art of making Read|ing-gla&s;&s;es,
the Camera Ob&s;cura, Micro&s;copes,
Tele&s;copes, and various other mathematical and
a&s;tronomical in&s;truments. He di&s;covered a
method of performing all the chymical opera|tions
<PB N="6" REF="19">
that are now in u&s;e. He combined the
mechanical powers in &s;o wonderful a manner,
that it was for this he was accu&s;ed of magic.
His di&s;coveries in medicine were by no means
unimportant. That the ingredients of gun|powder,
and the art of making it, were well
known to him, is now undeniable: but the
<HI>humane philo&s;opher,</HI> dreading the con&s;equences
of communicating this di&s;covery to the world,
tran&s;po&s;ed the letters of the Latin words which
&s;ignify Charcoal, which made the whole ob&s;cure.
It was done thus&mdash;<HI>Luru mope can vbre,</HI> (<HI>car|bonum
pulvere.</HI>) By this means he rendered it
difficult to di&s;cover this dangerous &s;ecret by the
peru&s;al of his works; and, at the &s;ame time,
&s;ecured to him&s;elf the honour of having known
it, by &s;pecifying the other ingredients, if it
&s;hould be di&s;covered by any other per&s;on.
This accordingly happened after Bacon's
death; for, about the beginning of the four|teenth
century, one Barthold Schwartz, a Ger|man
monk, and chymi&s;t, accidentally di&s;co|vered
<PB N="7" REF="20">
gunpowder, as he was pounding &s;alt|petre,
&s;ulphur, and charcoal, in a mortar, for
&s;ome other purpo&s;e.'</P>
<P>To this we may add, that the Chine&s;e em|ployed
gunpowder in their wars; and were
familiar with the art of printing, probably,
&s;ome centuries before we made u&s;e of them in
Europe.</P>
<P>Though Bacon is mentioned, in this artical,
as the inventor of optical gla&s;&s;es, Marville gives
a curious piece of information. He &s;ays, that
'it is generally known, that James Metius, a
Dutchman, invented, in 1609, <HI>&s;pectacles</HI> and
<HI>tele&s;copes</HI>; and that Galileo, being at Venice,
imitated as well as he could a tele&s;cope, and
a&s;toni&s;hed the learned Venetians from the
tower of St. Mark with this novel invention.'
And he adds&mdash;'But there are <HI>few</HI> who know
that the <HI>principles</HI> of optics, on which tele&s;copes
are formed, are to be found in <HI>Euclid,</HI> and in
the antient geometricians; and that it is through

<HEAD>THE RECOVERY OF MANUSCRIPTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a Florentine who found buried in a
heap of du&s;t, and in a rotten coffer belonging
to the mona&s;tery of Saint Gal, the works of
Quintilian; and, by this fortunate di&s;covery,
gave them to the Republic of Letters.</P>
<P>Papirius Ma&s;&s;on found, in the hou&s;e of a
book-binder of Lyons, the works of Agobart.
The mechanic was on the point of u&s;ing the
manu&s;cripts to line the covers of his books.</P>
<P>Raimond Soranzo, a celebrated lawyer in the
Papal Court at Avignon, about the middle of
the fourteenth century, had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the
two books of Cicero on Glory. He made a
pre&s;ent of them to Petrarch, who lent them to
an aged and poor man of letters, formerly his
<PB N="9" REF="22">
preceptor. Urged by extreme poverty, the old
man pawned them; and, returning home, died
&s;uddenly, without having revealed where he
had left them: &s;ince which time they have
never been recovered.</P>
<P>Leonard Aretin was one of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
&s;cholars at the dawn of literature; but
he has done that which reflects on him great
di&s;honour. He found a Greek manu&s;cript of
Procopius <HI>de Bello Gothico.</HI> This he tran&s;lated
into Latin, and publi&s;hed the work as his own.
Since, however, other manu&s;cripts of the &s;ame
work have been di&s;covered; and the fraud of
Leonard Aretin is apparent.</P>
<P>Machiavel acted more adroitly in a &s;imilar
ca&s;e. A manu&s;cript of the Apophthegms of the
Ancients, by Plutarch, having fallen into his
hands, he &s;elected tho&s;e which plea&s;ed him,
and put them into the mouth of one of his
heroes.</P>
<P>A page of the &s;econd Decade of Livy was
found by a man of letters on the parchment of
<PB N="10" REF="23">
his battledore, as he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in
the country. He ran directly to the maker of
the battledore: but arrived too late; the man
had fini&s;hed the la&s;t page of Livy, in compleat|ing
a large order for the&s;e articles about a
week before.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Cotton, being one day at his
tailor's, di&s;covered that the man held in his
hand, ready to be cut up for mea&s;ures, the ori|ginal
Magna Charta, with all it's appendages of
&s;eals and &s;ignatures. He bought this &s;ingular
curio&s;ity for a trifle; and recovered, in this man|ner,
what had long been given over for lo&s;t.&mdash;As this anecdote is entirely new to me, it may
be proper to point out that it is taken from
the Colome&s;iana, page 186.</P>
<P>Whether the Poems of Rowley be originals,
adulterations, or the compo&s;itions of Chatter|ton,
I do not venture to decide: this, how|ever,
is certain, that the finding them in the
worm-eaten che&s;t, in the antient church at
Bri&s;tol, has a very <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> appearance, and is
<PB N="11" REF="24">
undoubtedly in the nature of &s;uch di&s;coveries.
It is not probable&mdash;for he was, I believe, igno|rant
of the French language&mdash;that poor Chat|terton,
like me, had laboured through all the
<HI>Ana,</HI> and caught the idea from their peru&s;al.</P>
<P>We might be inclined to forgive a &s;kilful
<HI>forgery</HI> of the two books of Cicero on Glory:
they mu&s;t have been very important and curi|ous;
for no man was more enthu&s;ia&s;tically

<HEAD>SKETCHES OF CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Yes, &s;hould Great Homer lift his aweful head,</L>
<L>Zoilus again would &s;tart up from the dead!</L></Q>
<P>THE greate&s;t authors of antiquity have
&s;marted under the la&s;h of Critici&s;m. Chevrau
has collected a great number of in&s;tances. Le&s;t
I &s;hould prove tedious, I only &s;elect a few.</P>
<P>It was given out, that Homer had &s;tolen from
He&s;iod whatever was mo&s;t remarkable in the
<PB N="12" REF="25">
Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey. The Emperor Caligula
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed the works of this great poet; and
gave, for rea&s;on, that he certainly had as much
right as Plato, who had &s;o &s;everely condemned
him.</P>
<P>Sophocles was brought to trial by his chil|dren
as a lunatic: and &s;ome, who blamed
the inequalities of this poet, have al&s;o con|demned
the vanity of Pindar; the hard and
rough ver&s;es of Ae&s;chylus; and the manner in
which Euripides conducted his plots.</P>
<P>Socrates, who has even been compared to
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the wi&s;e&s;t and the mo&s;t moral
of men, Cicero has treated as an u&s;urer, and
Athenaeus as an illiterate per&s;on. Mr. Cum|berland,
in one of his Ob&s;ervers, has indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
revived a calumny which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly
only took it's ri&s;e from the malignant buffoonery
of Ari&s;tophanes; who, as Jortin &s;ays, was a
great wit, but a great ra&s;cal. Should &s;ome fu|ture
author draw his anecdotes from the writ|ings
of Foote, or of Peter Pindar, we know
well that he might delineate a &s;pirited cha|racter;
<PB N="13" REF="26">
but nothing, at the &s;ame time, would
be more fictitious.</P>
<P>Plato, who has been called, by Clement of
Alexandria, the Mo&s;es of Athens; the Philo|&s;opher
of the Chri&s;tians, by Arnobius; and
the God of Philo&s;ophers, by Cicero; has un|dergone
a variety of critici&s;ms. Athenaeus
accu&s;es him of envy; Theopompus, of lying;
Suidas, of avarice; Aulus Gellius, of robbery;
Porphyry, of incontinence; and Ari&s;tophanes,
of impiety.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, who according to &s;ome writers
has compo&s;ed more than four hundred vo|lumes,
and who for his work on animals re|ceived
from Alexander eight hundred talents,
has not been le&s;s &s;pared by the critics. Dio|genes
Laertius, Cicero, and Plutarch, have
forgotten nothing that can tend to &s;hew his
ignorance, his ambition, and his vanity.</P>
<P>If the reader does not feel him&s;elf weary, he
may read on.</P>
<P>Virgil is de&s;titute of invention, if we are to
<PB N="14" REF="27">
give credit to Pliny, Carbilius, and Seneca.
Caligula has ab&s;olutely denied him even medi|ocrity;
Herennus has marked his faults; and
Perilius Fau&s;tinus has furni&s;hed a thick vo|lume
with his plagiari&s;ms. Even the author of
his Apology has confe&s;&s;ed, that he has &s;tolen
from Homer his greate&s;t beauties.</P>
<P>Horace cen&s;ures the coar&s;e humour of Plau|tus;
and Horace, in his turn, has been blamed
for fiction and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The majority of the critics regard Pliny's
Hi&s;tory only as a plea&s;ing romance; and
&s;eem to have quite as little re&s;pect for Quintus
Curtius.</P>
<P>Pliny cannot bear Diodorus and Vopi&s;cus;
and, in one comprehen&s;ive critici&s;m, treats all
the hi&s;torians as narrators of fables.</P>
<P>Livy has been reproached for his aver&s;ion
to the Gauls; Dion, for his hatred of the Re|public;
Velleius Paterculus, for &s;peaking too
kindly of the vices of Tiberius; and Hero|dotus
and Plutarch, for their exce&s;&s;ive par|tiality
<PB N="15" REF="28">
to their own country. Others have
&s;aid of Cicero, that there is no connection,
and, to adopt their own figure, no <HI>blood</HI> and
<HI>nerves,</HI> in what his admirers &s;o warmly ex|tol.
They &s;ay, he is cold in his extempo|raneous
effu&s;ions, too artificial in his exor|diums,
trifling in his &s;trained wittici&s;ms, and
tire&s;ome in his digre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Quintilian does not &s;pare Seneca; and De|mo&s;thenes,
called by Cicero the Prince of
Orators, has, according to Hermippus, more of
art than of nature. To Demades, his ora|tions
appear too much laboured; others have
thought him too dry; and, if we may tru&s;t
E&s;chines, his language is by no means pure.</P>
<P>Should we proceed with this li&s;t to our
own country, and our own times, it might be
curiou&s;ly augmented; but, perhaps, enough has
been &s;aid, to &s;oothe irritated genius, and to &s;hame
fa&s;tidious critici&s;m. 'I would beg the critics
to remember,' the Earl of Ro&s;common writes,
in his Preface to his Ver&s;ion of Horace's Art
<PB N="16" REF="29">
of Poetry, 'that Horace owed his favour and
his fortune to the character given of him by
Virgil and Varius; that Fundanius and Pollio
are &s;till valued by what Horace &s;ays of them;
and that, in their Golden Age, there was a good
under&s;tanding among the ingenious, and tho&s;e
who were the mo&s;t e&s;teemed were the be&s;t|natured.'
I would hope, in &s;pite of the daily
cries we hear from di&s;appointed writers, that
tho&s;e Journali&s;ts, who&s;e &s;tyle and &s;entiments
render them re&s;pectable in the eyes of every
man of letters, maintain with rigid integrity
the fountains of critici&s;m pure and incor|rupt.
They cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that their
volumes are not merely read, and then forgot|ten;
but that they will remain as &s;urviving

'In that part of Tartary which belongs to

univer&s;ity, where the Arabs cultivate literature.
Gioan Bapti&s;ta Remondi, who was the fir&s;t
who cau&s;ed books in the Arabic language to
be printed in Europe, and who had even
&s;tudied in this univer&s;ity, has pretended to &s;ay,
that there were a number of Arabic books
tran&s;lated from many Greek authors who re|main
unknown to the Europeans. It was the
Arabians who have pre&s;erved a book of Archi|medes:
with many authors who have written
on mathematics; &s;uch as Apollonius Pergeaeus,
and even Ari&s;totle, Hippocrates, and Galen.'</P>
<P>To this account may be added that which

It is&mdash;'That in Siberia there exi&s;ts an uncom|mon

<P>The Bibliomania, or the collecting an enor|mous

&s;coured all Europe, and &s;ent out travellers to
the Indies to di&s;cover ancient books, or &s;carce

<P>A &s;imilar impo&s;ition was practi&s;ed on the
great Peire&s;c. It was reported, that the
Ethiopians were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a book writ|ten
by Enoch. Many literati in Europe had
long ardently de&s;ired to in&s;pect it, as they
imagined it would contain many valuable &s;e|crets

impo&s;tor having got an Ethiopic book into his

Mazarine's library, there Ludolf, famous

<HEAD>THE TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>CHARPENTIER, in the Carpenteriana, &s;ays
that the Turks, whom the vulgar literati re|gard

general hi&s;tories, from O&s;man, the fir&s;t of their

<P>There are colleges e&s;tabli&s;hed at Con&s;tan|tinople,

<HEAD>THE PORTRAITS OF AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the ancients, it was undoubtedly a
cu&s;tom to place the portraits of Authors
before their works. Martial will &s;erve as a
te&s;timony in this ca&s;e. The hundred and
eighty-&s;ixth Epigram of his fourteenth Book
is a mere play on words, concerning a little
volume which contained the works of Virgil,
and which had his portrait prefixed to it. The
volume and the characters mu&s;t have been
very diminutive. Antiquity records many &s;uch
penmen, who&s;e glory con&s;i&s;ted in writing in
&s;o &s;mall a hand, that it was not legible to the
naked eye. One wrote a ver&s;e of Homer on a
grain of millet; and another, more trifling
and indefatigable, tran&s;cribed the whole Iliad
in &s;o con&s;ined a &s;pace, that it could be inclo&s;ed
in a nut &s;hell. Menage &s;ays, that the&s;e things
<PB N="24" REF="37">
are not &s;o improbable as they &s;eem. This
trifling art is not lo&s;t in modern times. He
&s;ays, he has read whole &s;entences which were
not perceptible to the eye without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the micro&s;cope. He has even &s;een <HI>portraits</HI>
and <HI>pictures</HI> of the &s;ame kind; and, which
&s;eems wonderful, what appeared lines and
&s;cratches thrown down at random, were letters
in capitals: and the lineaments of Madame
la Dauphin&eacute;'s face were pre&s;erved with the
mo&s;t plea&s;ing delicacy, and with correctne&s;s of
re&s;emblance. He read al&s;o an Italian poem,
in <HI>prai&s;e</HI> of this prince&s;s, which contained
<HI>&s;ome thou&s;ands</HI> of ver&s;es; [I tran&s;cribe his words]
It was written, by an officer, in a &s;pace of a
foot and a half.</P>
<P>Martial is not the only writer who takes
notice of the ancients prefixing their portraits
to their works. Seneca, in his ninth chapter
on the Tranquillity of the Soul, complains of
many of the luxurious great, who&mdash;like &s;o
many of our own&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed libraries as they
<PB N="25" REF="38">
do their e&s;tates and equipages. 'It is melan|choly

<HEAD>CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY after the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of letters,
(Huet writes) Critici&s;m formed the chief occu|pation
of tho&s;e who applied them&s;elves to their
cultivation. This was very nece&s;&s;ary, after &s;o

if we may &s;o expre&s;s our&s;elves, to di&s;per&s;e the

worms that gnawed and disfigured tho&s;e ma|nu&s;cripts
which had e&s;caped the fury of the
Barbarians, and the depredations of Time.</P>
<P>It was thus the art of critici&s;m flouri&s;hed in
all it's vigour, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed by it's
u&s;eful labours, during two centuries. The &s;u|preme
degree of erudition, con&s;i&s;ted in bring|ing
to light the ancient authors in the cor|rection
of the errors of the &s;cribes, through
who&s;e hands they had pa&s;&s;ed, either by col|lating
them with the be&s;t copies, or exerting
their own judgment and learning to the re|&s;toring
of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which were evidently
corrupt. At length, this avocation degenerated
into a low and ob&s;cure &s;tudy, the chief merit
of which con&s;i&s;ted in the recovery and collation
of the be&s;t manu&s;cripts. This was the em|ployment
of Gruter during his whole life.
Tho&s;e to whom the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances failed, em|ployed
their critical acumen and literature to
<PB N="27" REF="42">
give the ancient writers in all their purity;
but, not infrequently, they di&s;membered that
which before was entire, and occa&s;ioned an
infinity of labours to the critics, their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors,
who were &s;omewhat more judicious
than them&s;elves in re&s;toring the pa&s;&s;ages to
their original &s;tate, and in healing tho&s;e wounds
and unmerciful lacerations which they had
undergone.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e latter critics, Ca&s;aubon, Sal|ma&s;ius,
and Gronovius, hold di&s;tingui&s;hed
rank.</P>
<P>Now that the be&s;t authors are no more
&s;carce, but multiplied without end by the in|vention
of printing, verbal critici&s;m, the chief
merit of which is to catch &s;yllables, de&s;erves
no longer our e&s;teem. Critics of this kind
may, not unaptly, be compared to weeders;

<HEAD>THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent article, I am little more than
the tran&s;lator of the lively and ingenious Vig|neul
Marville.</P>
<P>The Republic of Letters is of an ancient
date. It appears by the pillars Jo&s;ephus has
noticed, on which were engraven the principles
of the &s;ciences, that this republic exi&s;ted be|fore
the Deluge; at lea&s;t, it cannot be denied
that, &s;oon after this great cata&s;trophe, the
&s;ciences flouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Never was a republic greater, better peopled,
more free, or more glorious: it is &s;pread on
the face of the earth, and is compo&s;ed of per|&s;ons
of every nation, of every rank, of every
age, and of both &s;exes. They are intimately
acquainted with every language, the dead as
well as the living. To the cultivation of let|ters
they join that of the arts; and the me|chanics
<PB N="31" REF="46">
are al&s;o permitted to occupy a place.
But their religion cannot boa&s;t of uniformity;
and their manners, like tho&s;e of every other
republic, form a mixture of good and of evil:
they are &s;ometimes enthu&s;ia&s;tically pious, and
&s;ometimes in&s;anely impious.</P>
<P>The politics of this &s;tate con&s;i&s;t rather in
words, in vague maxims and ingenious re|flections,
than in actions, or their effects.
This people owe all their &s;trength to the bril|liancy
of their eloquence, and the &s;olidity of
their arguments. Their trade is perfectly intel|lectual,
and their riches very moderate; they
live in one continued &s;trife for glory and for
immortality. Their dre&s;s is by no means &s;plen|did;
yet they affect to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who labour
through the impul&s;e of avarice or nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>They are divided into many &s;ects, and they
&s;eem to multiply every day. The &s;tate is
&s;hared between the Philo&s;ophers, the Phy&s;i|cians,
the Divines, the Lawyers, the Hi&s;torians,
the Mathematicians, the Orators, the Gram|marians,
<PB N="32" REF="47">
and the Poets, who have each their
re&s;pective laws.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered by the Critics, fre|quently,
with more &s;everity than ju&s;tice. The
people groan under the tyranny of the&s;e go|vernors,
particularly when they are capricious
and vi&s;ionary. They re&s;cind, they era&s;e, or
add, at their will and plea&s;ure, much in the
manner of the Grand Monarque&mdash;<HI>Car tel e&s;t
notre plai&s;ir</HI>; and no author can an&s;wer for his
fate, when once he is fairly in their hands.
Some of the&s;e are &s;o unfortunate, that, through
the cruelty of the treatment they receive, they
lo&s;e not only their temper, but their &s;en&s;e and
wits.</P>
<P>Shame is the great ca&s;tigation of the guilty;
and to lo&s;e one's reputation, among this people,
is to lo&s;e one's life. There exi&s;t, however, but
too many impudent &s;windlers, who prey upon
the property of others; and many a vile &s;pun|ger,
who &s;natches the bread from the hands of
men of merit.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="48">
The Public are the di&s;tributors of glory;
but, too often, the di&s;tribution is made with
blindne&s;s, or undi&s;cerning precipitation. It is
this which cau&s;es loud complaints, and excites
&s;uch murmurs throughout the republic.</P>
<P>The predominating vices of this &s;tate are
pre&s;umption, vanity, pride, jealou&s;y, and ca|lumny.
There is al&s;o a di&s;temper peculiar to
the inhabitants, which is denominated <HI>hunger,</HI>
and which occa&s;ions frequent de&s;olations
throughout the country.</P>
<P>This republic, too, has the misfortune to
be infected with numerous Plagiari&s;ts; a
&s;pecies of banditti who rifle the pa&s;&s;engers.
The corruptors of books, and the forgers, are
not le&s;s formidable; nor do there want im|po&s;tors,
who form rhap&s;odies and be&s;tow pom|pous
titles on unimportant trifles, who levy
heavy contributions on the public.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o found an infinite number of
illu&s;trious Idlers and Voluptuaries; who, only
&s;eeking for tho&s;e volumes that afford amu&s;ement,
draw all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the &s;tate, without
<PB N="34" REF="49">
contributing any thing either to it's advantage
or it's glory. There are al&s;o Mi&s;anthropes,
born with an hatred of men: Pedants, who
are the terror of &s;choolboys, and the enemies
of urbanity and amiable manners.</P>
<P>I will not notice the licentious Geniu&s;es of
the republic, who are in an eternal ho&s;tility of
&s;entiments, and a warfare of di&s;putes; nor tho&s;e
fa&s;tidious minds, who are too delicate not to
be offended every moment; nor tho&s;e Vi|&s;ionaries,
who load their imagination with
crude and fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>All the&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in a re|public
&s;o va&s;t as that of Letters; where it is
permitted to every one to re&s;ide, and to live

<PB N="35" REF="50">
he could not have been the author. He, al&s;o,
at the return from the Babyloni&s;h captivity,
arranged into one body the Scriptures; and
many a&s;&s;ure us, on the authority of the an|cients,
that he corrected it in eighteen pa&s;&s;ages
which had been greatly altered and fal&s;ified. Is
there not rea&s;on to fear that he &s;till has left &s;o
much to correct, that the body of writings, which
pa&s;s under the name of the Holy Scriptures,
is little entitled to that &s;acred appellation? It's
corruptions and errors are at lea&s;t evident.
Hobbes perfectly di&s;credits Mo&s;es being the
author of the Pentateuch, in his Leviathan.
It appears that Mo&s;es delivered to Jo&s;hua &s;ome

Jo&s;hua gave them to the Judges or Elders; and
that, in the cour&s;e of time, they took the ar|rangement

<P>To this article we may add, that it is well

<PB N="39" REF="54">
It's mutations, too, are wonderful. I am at
a lo&s;s to account on what principles the pre|&s;ent
in&s;tance took place. Vigneul Marville
&s;upplies me with this anecdote&mdash;</P>
<P>Brebeuf, when he was young, felt an en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
inclination for the works of Horace.
His friend Gautier, on the contrary, was in|fected
with a ta&s;te for Lucan. This preference
frequently occa&s;ioned di&s;putes. To terminate
them, it was agreed that each of them &s;hould
read the favourite poet of his friend; that they
&s;hould examine with critical acumen, and decree
with candour. The con&s;equences are &s;ingular.
Gautier read Horace, became enamoured of his
ver&s;es, and never after quitted them: while
Brebeuf was &s;o charmed with Lucan, that he
grew intoxicated with the Phar&s;alia; and, in
tran&s;lating this epic, out-lucan'd Lucan him|&s;elf
in his bomba&s;tic and tumid ver&s;es.</P>
<P>That Gautier &s;hould reject Lucan, after a
&s;tudious peru&s;al of Horace, is not &s;urprizing:
the wonder is, how Brebeuf could forget &s;o
&s;uddenly the graces and the rules of his ma|&s;ter,
<PB N="40" REF="55">
Horace, to give into Lucan's corrupted
ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his elegant E&s;&s;ay on the
Sublime and Beautiful, &s;ays, that 'what is
called <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> in it's mo&s;t general acceptation,
is not a &s;imple idea, but is partly made up of
a perception of the primary plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e;
of the &s;econdary plea&s;ures of the imagination;
and of the conclu&s;ions of the rea&s;oning faculty
concerning the various relations of the&s;e, and
concerning the human pa&s;&s;ions, manners, and
actions. All the&s;e are requi&s;ite to form Ta&s;te;
and the ground-work of all the&s;e is the &s;ame
in the human mind: for, as the &s;en&s;es are
the great originals of all our ideas, and con|&s;equently
of all our plea&s;ures, if they are not
uncertain and arbitrary, the whole ground|work
of Ta&s;te is common to all; and, there|fore,
there is a &s;ufficient foundation for a con|clu&s;ive
rea&s;oning for the&s;e matters.'</P>
<P>In another place he ob&s;erves&mdash;'<HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI>
and <HI>Judgment,</HI> which are the qualities that
<PB N="41" REF="56">
compo&s;e what is commonly called a <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI>
vary exceedingly in various people. From a
defect in the former of the&s;e qualities ari&s;es a
want of Ta&s;te: a weakne&s;s in the latter con|&s;titutes
a wrong or a bad one.'</P>
<P>If this account is ju&s;t, the &s;en&s;ibility and the
judgment of Brebeuf, of which the one was
&s;o lively, and the other &s;o vigorous, when in
his youthful days he was attached to Horace,
mu&s;t have undergone a total change when he
became &s;tudiou&s;ly fond of Lucan. Yet this
is not to be conceived: for it is po&s;&s;ible to
enlarge and to &s;trengthen our judgment; but,
&s;urely, not to eradicate a correct one; at lea&s;t,

Socrates, whom the Oracle of Delphos had

Yet he was &s;o mode&s;t, that he affirmed he

<P>When the Art of Printing was fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,

<P>THE origin of &s;o many fables and intolerable

<P>Before any colleges were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
mona&s;teries where the &s;chools were held, the
<PB N="68" REF="83">
profe&s;&s;ors in rhetoric frequently gave their
&s;cholars the life of &s;ome &s;aint for a trial of their
talent at <HI>amplification.</HI> The &s;tudents, being
con&s;tantly at a lo&s;s to furni&s;h out their pages,
invented the&s;e wonderful adventures. The
good fathers of that age, who&s;e &s;implicity was
not inferior to their devotion, were &s;o delighted
with the&s;e flowers of rhetoric, that they were
induced to make a collection of the&s;e mira|culous
compo&s;itions; not imagining that, at
&s;ome di&s;tant period of time, they would be|come
matters of faith. Yet, when James de
Voraigne, (Vicar-general of the Jacobins)
Peter Nadal, and Peter Ribadeneira, wrote the
Lives of the Saints, they &s;ought for their ma|terials
in the libraries of the mona&s;teries; and,
awakening from the du&s;t the&s;e manu&s;cripts of
amplification, imagined they made an inva|luable
pre&s;ent to the world by laying before
them the&s;e bulky ab&s;urdities. The people re|ceived
them with all imaginable &s;implicity,
and, in the la&s;t century, it was dangerous
<PB N="69" REF="84">
for a man to dare even to &s;u&s;pect the reality
of the&s;e pious fictions. We are indebted to
Tillemont, to Fleury, Baillet, Launoi, and
Bollandus, for having cleared much of this
rubbi&s;h; and, rejecting what was fal&s;e, by an
enlightened critici&s;m, have made that probable,
which before was doubtful.</P>
<P>' What has been called <HI>The Golden Legend,</HI>
which is the compilation of the above Vo|raigne'
ob&s;erves Patin, 'is a book replete with
the mo&s;t ridiculous and &s;illy hi&s;tories ima|ginable'.
Melchior Canus, who was a learned
Dominican, greatly di&s;approves of this legend;
and had &s;aid, that 'it is a narrative at once un|worthy
of the Saints, and every hone&s;t Chri&s;|tian.
I do not know why it &s;hould be called

<P>' Among the in&s;ipid legends of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory, I am tempted to di&s;tingui&s;h the me|morable
fable of <HI>The Seven Sleepers</HI>; who&s;e
imaginary date corre&s;ponds with the reign of
the younger Theodo&s;ius, and the conque&s;t of
Africa by the Vandals. When the Emperor
Decius per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians, &s;even noble
youths of Ephe&s;us concealed them&s;elves in a
&s;pacious cavern, on the &s;ide of an adjacent
mountain; where they were doomed to peri&s;h
by the tyrant, who gave orders that the en|trance
&s;hould be firmly &s;ecured with a pile of
&s;tones. They immediately fell into a deep
&s;lumber, which was miraculou&s;ly prolonged,
without injuring the powers of life, during a
period of one hundred and eighty-&s;even years.
At the end of that time, the &s;laves of Adolius,
to whom the inheritance of the mountain had
<PB N="71" REF="86">
de&s;cended, removed the &s;tones, to &s;upply ma|terials

&s;un darted into the cavern, and the Seven
Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a
&s;lumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they
were pre&s;&s;ed by the calls of hunger; and re|&s;olved
that Jamblichus, one of their number,
&s;hould &s;ecretly return to the city, to purcha&s;e
bread for the u&s;e of his companions. The
youth&mdash;if we may &s;till employ that appel|lation&mdash;could no longer recognize the once
familiar a&s;pect of his native country; and his
&s;urprize was increa&s;ed by the appearance of a
large cro&s;s, triumphantly erected over the prin|cipal
gate of Ephe&s;us. His &s;ingular dre&s;s and
ob&s;olete language confounded the baker, to
whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius,
as the current coin of the empire; and Jam|blichus,
on the &s;u&s;picion of a &s;ecret trea&s;ure,
was dragged before the judge. Their mutual
enquiries produced the amazing di&s;covery, that
two centuries were almo&s;t elap&s;ed &s;ince Jam|blichus
<PB N="72" REF="87">
and his friends had e&s;caped from the
rage of a Pagan tyrant. The Bi&s;hop of Ephe|&s;us,
the Clergy, the Magi&s;trates, the people,
and, it is &s;aid, the Emperor Theodo&s;ius him&s;elf,
ha&s;tened to vi&s;it the cavern of the Seven
Sleepers; who be&s;towed their benediction, re|lated
their &s;tory, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant peace|ably
expired.</P>

<P>ACCIDENT has frequently occa&s;ioned the

Father Mallebranche will &s;erve for an example.
Having compleated his &s;tudies in Philo&s;ophy
and Theology, without any other intention
than devoting him&s;elf to &s;ome religious order,
he little expected to become of &s;uch celebrity
as his works have made him. Loitering, in

turning over a parcel of books, <HI>L'Homme de
De&s;cartes</HI> fell into his hands. Having dipt
into &s;ome parts, he was induced to peru&s;e the
whole. It was this circum&s;tance that produced
<PB N="76" REF="91">
tho&s;e profound contemplations which gave birth,
to &s;o many beautiful compo&s;itions in Phy&s;ics,
Metaphy&s;ics, and Morality, which have made
him pa&s;s for the Plato of his age.</P>
<P>Cowley became a Poet by accident. In his
mother's apartment he found, when very young,
Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen; and, by a continual
&s;tudy of Poetry, he became &s;o enchanted of the
Mu&s;e, that he grew irrecoverably a Poet.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on informs, us, that 'the great

<P>Spons, a Phy&s;ician at Lyons, has written his

<P>The two Patins have written nothing con|cerning
Medicine, but much in Polite Li|terature.</P>
<P>Perrault, the antagoni&s;t of Boileau, tran&s;lated
Vitruvius, and gave public Lectures on Geo|metry
and Architecture.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="93">
Dr. Smollet had more frequently his pen,

<P>Aken&s;ide and Arm&s;trong are celebrated for

<PB N="79" REF="94">
according to their profe&s;&s;ional character; but,
more frequently, according to their whim.</P>
<P>Tycho Brahe diverted him&s;elf with poli&s;hing

mathematical in&s;truments.</P>
<P>D'Andilly, the Tran&s;lator of Jo&s;ephus, one
of the mo&s;t learned men of his age, cultivated
trees; Barclay, in his lei&s;ure hours, was a
flori&s;t; Balzac amu&s;ed him&s;elf with making

his medals and antiquarian curio&s;ities; the
Abb&eacute; de Maroles with his engravings; and
Politian in &s;inging airs to his lute.</P>
<P>Rohault wandered from &s;hop to &s;hop, to ob|&s;erve
the mechanics labour.</P>
<P>The great Arnauld read, in his hours of re|laxation,
any amu&s;ing romance that fell into
his hands. This al&s;o did the critical War|burton.</P>
<P>Galileo read Ario&s;to; and Chri&s;tina, Queen

<P>Guy Patin wrote letters to his friends: an
<PB N="80" REF="95">
u&s;ual relaxation among&s;t men of letters, and
very agreeable to their corre&s;pondents, when
they are worth the po&s;tage.</P>
<P>Others have found amu&s;ement in compo&s;ing
treati&s;es on odd &s;ubjects. Seneca wrote a Bur|le&s;que
Narrative on Claudian's Death. Pierrius
has written an Eulogium on Beards.</P>
<P>Virgil &s;ported prettily with a gnat; Homer
with frogs and mice.</P>
<P>Hol&s;tein has written an Eulogium on the

the Tran&s;migration of the Para&s;itical Pedant to

<P>Era&s;mus has compo&s;ed&mdash;I think it was to
amu&s;e him&s;elf when travelling in a po&s;t|chai&s;e&mdash;his Panegyric on Morus, or Folly;
which, authorized by the pun, he dedicated to
Sir Thomas More.</P>
<P>Montaigne found a very agreeable play-mate
in his cat.</P>
<P>Cardinal de Richelieu, among&s;t all his great

occupations, found a recreation in violent exer|ci&s;es;
and he was once di&s;covered jumping
with his &s;ervant, to try who could reach the

in the true &s;pirit of a courtier, having made
&s;ome efforts which nearly reached the Car|dinal's,
confe&s;&s;ed he was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by him.
This was jumping like a politician; and it

<P>Dr. Campbell was alike fond of robu&s;t exer|ci&s;e;

<P>What ridiculous amu&s;ements pa&s;&s;ed between

<HEAD>THE BELLES LETTRES.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems to be the fate of the Belles Lettres,
an ingenious French writer ob&s;erves, that they
break out in all their &s;plendour during &s;ome
<PB N="83" REF="98">
ages, and then are again doomed to decline into
total neglect.</P>
<P>Athens long pre&s;erved a correct ta&s;te in Elo|quence,
in Philo&s;ophy, and in Poetry. At the
&s;ame time, the Fine Arts flouri&s;hed in all their
beauty; but a frightful barbari&s;m &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded
the refinement and the &s;cience of this
ingenious nation.</P>
<P>The Romans, having vanqui&s;hed the Greeks,
awakened the Mu&s;es from their lethargy; and
the Augu&s;tan Age was for Italy what that
of Pi&s;i&s;tratus had been for Greece. The de|cline
of that empire &s;oon occa&s;ioned that of
the Belles Lettres; and the inva&s;ions of tho&s;e
people who di&s;membered the Roman Empire
threw all again into barbari&s;m and ignorance.
Charlemagne attempted to revive the &s;ciences:
he rewarded the learned; and he e&s;tabli&s;hed
&s;chools in the principal cities of the Empire.
It was his command, that a number of volumes
&s;hould be tran&s;cribed, to be di&s;per&s;ed through|out
the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="99">
Our illu&s;trious Alfred began the &s;ame refor|mation
in England. Engaged as he was in
one continued war with the Danes, nothing
could di&s;turb the de&s;igns he had formed for
the re&s;toration of letters. He laments the
ignorance of the times with all the indignation
of the philo&s;opher, and the re&s;entment of a

<P>The attempts of the&s;e great monarchs availed
little: the cla&s;h of arms taught a melancholy

e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Belles Lettres in&s;en&s;ibly re|vived.</P>
<P>But it was chiefly under the pontificate of
Leo the Tenth, that munificent patron of lite|rature,
that they &s;prung up in all their riche&s;t

which had been di&s;covered &s;ome time before,

<HEAD>ON THE NOTES VARIORUM.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Notes Variorum</HI> were, originally, but a
compilation of notes drawn from tho&s;e nume|rous
critics who had laboured on the be&s;t au|thors,
<PB N="92" REF="107">
or had explained them in other works.
The fir&s;t collections were very indifferent, their
&s;electors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no powers of di&s;crimination.
Frequently, they have cho&s;en the wor&s;t: they
bring no proofs from the authors whom they
have abridged; and they are continually maim|ing
their ideas. To make their collections
bulky, they have written as much on the clear
as on the ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages, and have &s;welled
them with very frivolous digre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The later editions of the <HI>Notes Variorum</HI>
have been made by more able compilers. As
they are &s;o much the more preferable to the
preceding ones, the public has received them
with favour; and &s;cholars have been glad to
have compleat collections of the mo&s;t valued
critici&s;ms, to con&s;ult them at their need.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE EDITIONS OF THE CLASSICS, IN
USUM DELPHINI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scholia&s;ts, or the Interpreters of the
Dauphin, <HI>in u&s;um Sereni&s;&s;imi Delphini,</HI> were
undertaken under the conduct of Me&s;&s;ieurs
<PB N="93" REF="108">
De Montau&s;ier, Bo&s;&s;uet, and Huet. To a cor|rect
text, they have added a clear and conci&s;e
paraphra&s;e of the text, with notes. The di&s;|&s;imilarity
of the genius, and the peculiar cha|racters,
of all the&s;e authors, have been one
great cau&s;e that they have not all been
treated with the &s;ame ability, and with equal
felicity: but &s;till, it mu&s;t be allowed, they form
the mo&s;t beautiful body in literature that the
public has ever been gratified with.</P>
<P>Another critic pre&s;ents us with a more &s;atis|factory
account of this celebrated edition of the
Cla&s;&s;ics. The greater part of the&s;e interpre|ters
have but indifferently executed their em|ployment:
they have followed, in their text,
the inferiour editions, in&s;tead of making u&s;e of
the be&s;t; and they have left in the notes tho&s;e
&s;ame faults which were &s;o much cen&s;ured in
the Dutch editions, with the Notes Variorum.
There is, however, one thing valuable in the
Paris editions&mdash;a Verbal Index, by which any
pa&s;&s;age may be found on recollecting a few
<PB N="94" REF="109">
words. However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the
munificent patronage of a great monarch has
not produced the adequate effects. The pro|ject
was excellent, but the performance was
bad.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this article without ob|&s;erving
what benefits the &s;tudent derives from
<HI>Verbal Indexes.</HI> He not only &s;aves a great ex|pence
of time, which is &s;quandered in the ex|amination
for pa&s;&s;ages; but he may more ea&s;ily
trace the imitations of others, when they hap|pen
to catch the words of the original. I have
received &s;uch &s;ervices from Newton's edition
of Milton, which is enriched with a Verbal
Index, that I cannot recollect them without
gratitude. If a Verbal Index was formed to
John&s;on's edition of the Poets, it would <HI>then</HI>
become invaluable; and I am &s;ure there are
<HI>porters</HI> enough in literature, <HI>unemployed,</HI> who
de&s;ire nothing better than to bear this burthen
on their &s;houlders</P>

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF LITERARY JOURNALS.</HEAD>
<P>IF we abound with a multitude of <HI>&s;cribblers,</HI>
what an infinite number mu&s;t there be of <HI>critics,</HI>
&s;ince, according to the computation of one of
the fir&s;t&mdash;<Q><HI>Ten</HI> cen&s;ure wrong, for <HI>one</HI> who writes ami&s;s!</Q></P>
<P>In the la&s;t century, it was a con&s;olation, at
lea&s;t, for the un&s;ucce&s;sful writer, that he fell
in&s;en&s;ibly into oblivion. If he committed the
<HI>private</HI> folly of printing what no one would
purcha&s;e, he had only to &s;ettle the matter with
his publi&s;her: he was not arraigned at the
<HI>public</HI> tribunal, as if he had committed a crime
of magnitude. But, in tho&s;e times, the nation
was little addicted to the cultivation of letters:
the writers were then few, and the readers were
not many. When, at length, a ta&s;te for lite|rature
&s;pread it&s;elf through the body of the
people, vanity induced the inexperienced and
<PB N="96" REF="111">
the ignorant to a&s;pire to literary honours. To
oppo&s;e the&s;e inroads into the haunts of the
Mu&s;es, Periodical Critici&s;m brandi&s;hed it's
formidable weapon; and it was by the fall of
others that our greate&s;t geniu&s;es have been
taught to ri&s;e. Multifarious writings produced
multifarious &s;trictures; and if the rays of cri|tici&s;m
were not always of the &s;tronge&s;t kind,
yet &s;o many continually i&s;&s;uing, formed
a focus, which has enlightened tho&s;e who&s;e
occupations had otherwi&s;e never permitted
them to judge on literary compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The origin of &s;o many Literary Journals
takes it's birth in France. Denis de Sallo,
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Coun&s;ellor in the Parliament of
Paris, invented the &s;cheme of a work of this
kind. On the 30th of May 1665, appeared
the fir&s;t number of his <HI>Journal des S&ccedil;avans.</HI>'
What is remarkable, he publi&s;hed his E&s;&s;ay in
the name of the Sieur de H&eacute;douville, who was
his <HI>footman.</HI> One is led to &s;uppo&s;e, by this
circum&s;tance, that he entertained but a faint
<PB N="97" REF="112">
hope of it's &s;ucce&s;s; or, perhaps, he thought
that the &s;currility of critici&s;m might be &s;anc|tioned
by it's &s;uppo&s;ed author. The work,
however, met with &s;o favourable a reception,
that Sallo had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing it, in
the next year, imitated throughout Europe;
and his Journal, at the &s;ame time, tran&s;lated
into various languages. But, as mo&s;t authors
lay them&s;elves too open to the &s;evere critic, the
animadver&s;ions of Sallo were given with &s;uch
malignity of wit and a&s;perity of critici&s;m, that
the Journal excited loud murmurs, and the
mo&s;t heart-moving complaints po&s;&s;ible. Sallo,
after having publi&s;hed only his third Journal,
felt the irritated wa&s;ps of literature thronging
&s;o thick about him, that he very gladly abdi|cated
the throne of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>The reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Abb&eacute; Galloys&mdash;intimidated by the fate of Sallo&mdash;was of a milder
kind. He contented him&s;elf with only giving
the titles of books, accompanied with extracts.
Such a conduct was not offen&s;ive to their au|thors,
<PB N="98" REF="113">
and yet was not unu&s;eful to the public.
I do not, however, mean to favour the idea,
that this &s;imple manner of noticing books is
equal to &s;ound and candid critici&s;m.</P>
<P>On the model of the <HI>Journal des S&ccedil;avans</HI>
were formed our <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI>;
with this difference, however, that they only
notice objects of &s;cience, &s;uch as Phy&s;ics and
Mathematics The Journal of Leip&s;ic, entitled
<HI>Acta Eruditorum,</HI> appeared in 1682, under the
conduct of the erudite <HI>Menkenius,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or
in the Univer&s;ity of that city. The famous
<HI>Bayle</HI> undertook, for Holland, a &s;imilar work,
in 1684; and his <HI>Nouvelles de la Republique de
Lettres</HI> appeared the fir&s;t of May in that year.
This new Journal was every where well re|ceived;
and de&s;erved to be &s;o, for never were
critici&s;ms given with greater force. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the art of comprizing, in &s;hort extracts,
the ju&s;te&s;t notion of a book, without adding
any thing irrelevant or impertinent. Bayle
di&s;continued this work in 1687, after having
<PB N="99" REF="114">
given thirty-&s;ix volumes in 12mo. Others
continued it to 1710, when it was finally
clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Mr. de la Roche formed an Engli&s;h
Journal, entitled <HI>Memoirs of Literature,</HI> about
the commencement of this century, which is
well &s;poken of in the Bibliotheque Rai&s;onn&eacute;e.
It was afterwards continued by Mr. Reid,
under the title of <HI>The Pre&s;ent State of the Re|public
of Letters.</HI> He &s;ucceeded very well;
but, being obliged to make a voyage to China,
it interrupted his u&s;eful labours. He was &s;uc|ceeded
by Me&s;&s;ieurs Campbell and Web&s;ter;
but the la&s;t, for rea&s;ons of which I am ignorant,
being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it was again re&s;umed by Mr.
Campbell. This <HI>Journal</HI> does by no means
rival our modern <HI>Reviews.</HI> I do not perceive
that the critici&s;m is more valuable; and cer|tainly
the entertainment is inferior. Our
elder Journals &s;eem only to notice a few of the
be&s;t publications; and this not with great ani|mation
of &s;entiment, or elegance of diction.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="115">
Of our modern Journals it becomes me to
&s;peak with caution. It is not treading on <HI>a&s;hes</HI>
&s;till glowing with latent fire, as Horace ex|pre&s;&s;es
it, but it is ru&s;hing through con&s;uming
<HI>flames.</HI> Let it be &s;ufficient, that from their
pages I acknowledge to have acquired a rich
fund of critical ob&s;ervation; and, if I have
been animated by their eulogiums, I a&s;cribe
this honour, not &s;o much to the confined abi|lities
Nature has be&s;towed on me, as to their
&s;trictures, which have taught me &s;omething of
the delicacy of Ta&s;te, and &s;omething of the
ardour of Genius.</P>

<HEAD>GUY PATIN.</HEAD>
<P>GUY PATIN was an author who made much

D'Argens, Voltaire, and many a French lite|rary
<HI>Cui&s;inier.</HI></P>
<P>The work, for which he gained &s;o much un|merited
applau&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts of three volumes of
letters, which were written to his friends in a
familiar &s;tyle, replete with the anecdotes of
the day&mdash;a kind of new&s;paper, rather than an
epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence; and, like a news|paper,
&s;ince time has commented on it's text,
it will be found that the greater part of the&s;e
anecdotes is fal&s;e and malicious. They were
read, however, with great avidity: but this
critici&s;m of Menage will be found to be
ju&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>' The Letters of Guy Patin are replete with
fal&s;hoods. Mr. Bigot and I have detected
&s;ome in every page. He was not careful in
<PB N="102" REF="117">
what he wrote, and he took every thing as it
came.'</P>
<P>' The&s;e Letters,' &s;ays Voltaire, 'were read
eagerly, becau&s;e they contained anecdotes of
&s;uch things as every body likes, and &s;atires
which are liked &s;till more. They &s;hew what
uncertain guides in Hi&s;tory tho&s;e writers are,
who incon&s;iderately &s;et down the news of the
day. Such accounts are frequently fal&s;e, or
perverted by the malice of mankind.'</P>
<P>Bayle, in critici&s;ing them, ob&s;erves&mdash;'It is

There are &s;ome places, wherein he &s;hews <HI>a

a criminal turn to every thing.'</P>
<P>This language is indeed forcible; it is cer|tainly
ju&s;t. The Reader may judge by the ex|tract
I now make out of the Patiniana, Page
17. It was written when Salma&s;ius fini&s;hed
his Defence of King Charles, which was &s;o ner|vou&s;ly
an&s;wered by Milton.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="118">
' The book of Mr. Salma&s;ius, written for the
defence of the King of England, is now print|ing
at Leyden, in French, and in Latin. This
apology for a king, who has been beheaded by
his people, is a delicate &s;ubject, and will not
plea&s;e every body. The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are the
<HI>wor&s;t,</HI> the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> cruel, and the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> perfidious

The mo&s;t refined politics do not go
&s;o far as <HI>to dare</HI> to puni&s;h kings, like other
malefactors, by the hand of the common
hangman. The grandfather of this Monarch
was &s;trangled by the Puritans of Scotland. His
grandmother, Mary Stuart, was beheaded in
England, in the year 1587, by the command
of Queen Elizabeth. I, who <HI>naturally</HI> hate the
Engli&s;h, cannot but &s;hudder with horror

pa&s;&s;ed &s;o near the times in which Patin lived,
he has committed, in this &s;hort extract, a gro&s;s
hi&s;torical blunder.</P>
<P>It has been a cu&s;tom to echo among&s;t the
Gallic writers, that the Engli&s;h nation are of
the race
<Q><L>&mdash;of the Cannibals that each other eat,</L>
<L>The Anthropophagi&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The very executions of our malefactors at
Tyburn have been urged as a proof. Hear

<P>' There have been &s;anguinary times in all
nations; but, among&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> more illu&s;|trious
men have been brought to the block
than <HI>in all Europe</HI> be&s;ides. It was the cha|racter
of this nation to commit legal murders.
The Gates of London have been infected with
human heads fixed to the walls.'</P>
<P>D'Argens, in his Philo&s;ophical Vi&s;ions, has
given the character of the Engli&s;h nations, un|der
the names of the Libertines, in the &s;econd
Vi&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;age is too long to be quoted;
<PB N="105" REF="120">
but the power of his pencil &s;eems not inferior
to that of the lively Voltaire's, in drawing our

<P>He &s;ays, that a civil war is our delight, and
the beheading a Monarch our amu&s;ement.
This hardly de&s;erves the name of Wit; it is

thought, that the&s;e lively and facetious

more &s;anguinary periods than England; and
that <HI>more</HI> of their Kings than of our own have
come to an untimely end. Let us recollect
the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations of Henry the Third and

<HEAD>THE TALMUD AND GEMARA.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Talmud</HI> is a collection of Jewi&s;h Tra|ditions,
which had been orally pre&s;erved. It
comprizes the <HI>Mi&s;hna,</HI> which is the text; and
the <HI>Gemara,</HI> it's commentary. It is a compleat
&s;y&s;tem of the barbarous learning of the Jews.
They have per&s;uaded them&s;elves, that the&s;e tra|ditional
explications are of a Divine origin: for
they tell us, that the Pentateuch was written
out by their Legi&s;lator before his death; that the
number of Copies was thirteen, one for each
tribe, and the remaining one was depo&s;ited in
the Ark. That the Oral Law, 'was what
Mo&s;es continually taught, in his Sanhedrim, to
the Elders, and the re&s;t of the people;' the mode
of which hone&s;t David Levi informs us was
thus&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="122">
' As &s;oon as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was returned to his tent
from receiving the words of God, he called
<HI>Aaron</HI> thither unto him, and fir&s;t delivered
unto him the <HI>Text,</HI> which was to be the Writ|ten
Law; and after that, the interpretation of it,
which was the <HI>Oral Law,</HI> in the &s;ame order
as he received <HI>both</HI> from <HI>God</HI> in the Mount.
Then Aaron ari&s;ing, and &s;eating him&s;elf at the
right-hand of Mo&s;es, Eleazar, and Ithamar, his
&s;ons, went in the next; and being taught both
the&s;e Laws at the feet of the Prophet, in the
&s;ame manner as Aaron had been, they al&s;o
aro&s;e and &s;eated them&s;elves; and then the
Seventy Elders, who con&s;tituted the Sanhedrim,
or Great Senate of the nation; and then enter|ed
all &s;uch of the people as were de&s;irous of
knowing the word of God.'</P>
<P>He then informs us that Mo&s;es, Aaron, his
&s;ons, and the Elders, made the &s;ame repetition
before they withdrew&mdash;'So that the people
having heard <HI>both</HI> the&s;e Laws repeated to them
four times, they all had it thereby firmly fixed
<PB N="108" REF="123">
in their memories; but the interpretation thereof
was to be delivered down, <HI>only by word of
mouth,</HI> to the &s;ucceeding generations,' for which
no rea&s;on is alledged.</P>
<P>It appears afterwards, that at the end of the
40th year of their flight from Egypt, the me|mory
of the people became treacherous, and
Mo&s;es was con&s;trained to repeat, every now and
then, this &s;ame <HI>Oral Law</HI>; which (if it is not
profane to &s;ay) had been much better <HI>written</HI>
as the Pentateuch was.</P>
<P>This hi&s;tory &s;ome may be inclined to &s;up|po&s;e
to be apocryphal. It appears that the
Talmud was compiled by certain Jewi&s;h doc|tors,
who were &s;olicited for this purpo&s;e by
their nation, that they might have &s;omething
to oppo&s;e to their Chri&s;tian adver&s;aries. The&s;e
doctors were de&s;cendants of the Ten Tribes of
I&s;rael, who were led into captivity by king Sal|manazar,
father of Sennacherib, in the reign
of King Ho&s;ea. This book is a mixture of the
Syriac, the Hebrew, and the vulgar Hebrew,
<PB N="109" REF="124">
which was the language &s;poken in the &s;chools
of the Rabbins, and which differs as much from
the other, as the Latin of Bartolinus from that
of Cicero. This work contains nothing that is
valuable, but a very heavy load of pious ab&s;ur|dities,
of in&s;ipid &s;tories and palpable contradic|tions.
The only apology that has been made
for the&s;e extravagancies and idle fictions, is,
that after the completion of the Talmud, tho&s;e
who &s;ucceeded in the Schools are di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the name of <HI>Opinioni&s;ts,</HI> and not by that of
<HI>Doctors</HI>; and that no Jew is compelled to receive
them as matters of faith, although we are in|formed
that this work originated (as we have
already ob&s;erved) from the Great Dictator of
the Written Law.</P>
<P>As the Reader may be curious to know one of
the&s;e Rabbinical Reveries, we have compiled
&s;ome notices which they have given concern|ing
<HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Adam's <HI>body</HI> was made of the earth of Ba|bylon,
his <HI>head</HI> of the land of I&s;rael, his <HI>other</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="125"><HI>members</HI> of other parts of the world. R. Meir
thought he was compact of the earth gathered
out of the whole earth; as it is written&mdash;<HI>Thine
eyes did &s;ee my &s;ub&s;tance.</HI> Now it is el&s;ewhere writ|ten&mdash;<HI>The eyes of the Lord are over all the earth.</HI>
R. Aha expre&s;sly marks the twelve hours
in which his various parts were formed. His
&s;tature was from one end of the world to the
other; and it was for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion that the
Creator, laying his hand in anger on him,
le&s;&s;ened him; for before, (&s;ays R. Eleazar)
'with his hand he reached the firmament.'
R. Jehuda thinks his &s;in was Here&s;y; but R.
I&s;aac thinks (as my author expre&s;&s;es it) that
'it was nouri&s;hing his fore&s;kin.'</P>
<P>They farther inform us, that he was an
Hermaphrodite, having both &s;exes, and a
double body; the female parts joined at the
&s;houlders, and back parts to the male; their
countenances turned from each other. And
this they prove by Mo&s;es &s;aying, '<HI>So God
created man in his image; male and female</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="126">
<HI>created he them, and he called their name</HI> ADAM.'
Adam, being &s;olitary, cut him&s;elf in two, (a
hint this to the Managers for their Panto|mimes)
and found him&s;elf fitted for pro|creation.
Leo Hebraeus thus reconciles the
fable of Plato's <HI>Audrogynus</HI> with the narra|tion
of Mo&s;es, from which he thinks it is
borrowed. Plato relates, that Jupiter, in the
fir&s;t forming of mankind, made them &s;uch
<HI>audrogini,</HI> with two bodies, of two &s;exes joined
in the brea&s;t, which he divided for their pride,
the navel &s;till remaining as a <HI>&s;car</HI> of the
wound then made.</P>
<P>This article may be &s;ufficient to &s;atiate
the Reader with a peru&s;al of the Talmud.

<P>The Cardinal placed in a gallery of his

Among them was Blai&s;e de Montluc, Mare&s;chal
of France. He was de&s;irous of compo&s;ing
the in&s;criptions which were to be placed
round the portraits. That which he intend|ed
for Montluc, was conceived in the&s;e terms:
<HI>Multa fecit, Plura &s;crip&s;it, Vir tamen, Magnus
fuit.</HI> He &s;hewed it to Bourbon, the Royal
Profe&s;&s;or in Greek, and a&s;ked his opinion
concerning it. Having read it, he expre&s;&s;ed
his di&s;like in warm terms, and thought it was
Latin much in the &s;tyle of the Breviary; and,
if it had concluded with an <HI>Allelujah,</HI> it would

<P>The Cardinal was one of tho&s;e ambitious
men who fooli&s;hly a&s;pire to excel in whatever

<P>Here are two intere&s;ting anecdotes&mdash;He
was jealous of Balzac, becau&s;e his reputa|tion
became &s;o &s;plendid: he even offered the
elder Hein&s;ius ten thou&s;and crowns to write
a Critici&s;m which &s;hould ridicule his elaborate
compo&s;itions. This Hein&s;ius refu&s;ed, becau&s;e
Salma&s;ius threatened to revenge Balzac on his
<HI>Herodes Infanticida.</HI></P>
<P>He attempted to rival the reputation of Cor|neille's
Cid, by oppo&s;ing to it one of the mo&s;t
ridiculous productions that was ever exhibited
<PB N="114" REF="129">
in the theatre. It was an allegorical Tragedy,
in which the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> had congregated the four
quarters of the world: it was di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the name of <HI>Europe</HI>; and a great deal of
political matter was thrown together, and di|vided
into &s;cenes and acts. When he fir&s;t &s;ent
it anonymou&s;ly to the French Academy, it was
reprobated. He then tore it in rage, and &s;cat|tered
it about his &s;tudy. Towards evening, like
another Medea lamenting over the members
of her own children, he and his &s;ecretary
pa&s;&s;ed the night in uniting the &s;cattered limbs.
He then ventured to avow him&s;elf; and, having
pretended to correct this incorrigible tragedy,
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Academy retracted their cen&s;ures&mdash;but the Public pronounced it's melancholy
fate, on it's fir&s;t repre&s;entation. This was the
tragedy which was intended to thwart Cor|neille's
Cid. Enraged at it's &s;ucce&s;s, Richelieu
even commanded the Academy to publi&s;h an
abu&s;ive <HI>Critique</HI> of it, which is well known in
<PB N="115" REF="130">
French literature. Boileau; on this occa&s;ion,
has the&s;e two well-turned ver&s;es&mdash;<Q><L>En vain, contre le Cid, un Mini&s;tre &s;e ligue;</L>
<L>Tout Paris, pour Chimene, a les yeux de Rodrigue.</L></Q>

<L>All Paris, for <HI>Chimene,</HI> has <HI>Rodrigue's</HI> eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>We mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that Cardinal
Richelieu was a great politician. Whether his
<HI>Nouveau Te&s;tament</HI> be his entire compo&s;ition, is
uncertain. He mu&s;t, however, have &s;upplied
the materials, as it contains much of what none
but him&s;elf could know. The&s;e anecdotes will
&s;erve to &s;hew, to what a degree of &s;elf-opinion
Vanity may level a great man. He who would
attempt to di&s;play Univer&s;al Excellence, will
probably be di&s;appointed; it is certain he will
be impelled to practi&s;e meanne&s;&s;es, and to act
follies, which if he has the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility,

<HEAD>CARDAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE famous Cardan was born at Milan, or
at Padua, the place of his nativity being un|certain,
in the year 1501. To great natural
powers, he added much acquired knowledge:
but, above all, he was ever de&s;irous of informa|tion;
and, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a French
writer, he pa&s;&s;ed his life in continual medita|tion.
On him the Italians have made this acute
ob&s;ervation&mdash;that he has written more than he
had read, and taught more than he had learnt.
He died at Rome in 1576, where he attended
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, in the character
of Phy&s;ician. In his book, <HI>de Arcanis Aeter|nitatis,</HI>
will be found a great number of cu|rious
di&s;coveries. Scaliger, who has written
again&s;t him, acknowledges that, in many parts
of his works, his intelligence &s;eems greater than
that which any writer ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; while, in
<PB N="117" REF="132">
other parts, he betrays an imbecillity of mind
which would not be excu&s;eable in a boy. In
matters of Religion, his opinions were un|&s;ettled:
he did not know where to chu&s;e. All
that has been &s;aid of God, of Paradi&s;e, of Pur|gatory,
of Hell, and of the Immortality of the
Soul, &amp;c. were things with him very di&s;put|able:

<HEAD>MARTIN LUTHER AND CALVIN.</HEAD>
<P>To oppo&s;e the Church of Rome in their idea

with the body, but that God revived both.
So that, according to his opinion, no one could
enter into the vi&s;ible pre&s;ence of God till this
operation had taken place. The Romi&s;h
Church holding a contrary opinion, he treated
as impious what it inculcates concerning the
<PB N="118" REF="133">
immortality of the &s;oul. The&s;e are dreadful
&s;hifts for men who pretend to act by an im|pul&s;e
of the Divinity!</P>
<P>Calvin was originally named <HI>Cauvin.</HI> His
&s;tipend, as Mini&s;ter at Geneva, was as mi&s;e|rable
as the income of a Welch Curate. He
was &s;ubject to <HI>eleven</HI> different maladies, which
continually afflicting him, irritated his di&s;po|&s;itions.
He had, indeed, &s;o much acerbity in his
temper, that he became un&s;upportable to tho&s;e
who were near him. It was this that occa&s;ion|ed
many Germans to &s;ay, 'that they preferred
being in Hell with Beza, to being in Paradi&s;e
with Calvin.' Every day he taught Theology,
preached, and held various conferences; yet,
in &s;pite of all his occupations, he contrived to
leave behind him, as an author, nine ponderous
folios! He died at Geneva, in 1594, aged
fifty-five. He was a learned man; but he
has cau&s;ed a world of woe. He &s;trove ambi|tiou&s;ly
to overturn every thing. He was cruel
and vindictive: he occa&s;ioned the per&s;ecution
<PB N="119" REF="134">
of Michael Servetus, who was &s;o cruelly put
to death in the name of a Chri&s;tian Religion,
and by the hands of men who profe&s;s Evan|gelical
Gentlene&s;s; and all this for a difference
about the Trinity!</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be recollected, that the&s;e

ob&s;cure; but that, like the riche&s;t ebony,

apology for the defects of a writer.</P>
<P>Lactantius cen&s;ures him for his inelegance

which were in tho&s;e times thought too
&s;ubtle and too bold; yet it is probably owing
to his &s;uperior genius that he appeared &s;o cul|pable

<HEAD>THE SCALIGERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Man of Letters mu&s;t confe&s;s&mdash;re|luctantly,
perhaps&mdash;that the literature which
&s;tores the head with &s;o many ingenious re|flections,
and &s;o much admirable intelligence,
may at the &s;ame time have little or no influence
over the virtues of the heart. The &s;ame vices,
and the &s;ame follies, di&s;grace the literate and
the illiterate. Who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a profounder
knowledge of the Grecian learning, or was a
more erudite critic, than <HI>Burman?</HI> Yet this
man lived unob&s;ervant of every ordinary de|cency
and moral duty. Who di&s;played more
acutene&s;s of mind, and a wider circle of lite|rature,
<PB N="136" REF="151">
than the <HI>Scaligers?</HI> Yet, from the
anecdotes and characters I collect of them, let
the reader contemplate the <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>The two Scaligers, father and &s;on, were two
prodigies of learning and of vanity. Schiop|pius
has tore the ma&s;k of that principality with
which the father had adorned him&s;elf; for the
elder Scaliger maintained that he was de&s;cended
from the Princes of Verona. Schioppius &s;ays,
and he is now credited, that he was originally
named Jules Burden; that he was born in the
&s;hop of a gilder; had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome part of his
life with a &s;urgeon; and then became a cor|delier.
The elevation of his mind made him
a&s;pire to honours greater than the&s;e: he threw
off his frock, and took the degree of Doctor
in Phy&s;ic at Paris. In this character he ap|peared
at Venice, and in Piedmont. He there
attached him&s;elf to a Prelate of the noble
Hou&s;e of Rovezza, and followed him to Agen,
of which his patron was made Bi&s;hop. He
there married the daughter of an apothecary.
<PB N="137" REF="152">
Such were the parents of Jo&s;eph Scaliger;
who, finding this chimerical principality in his
family, pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for a <HI>Prince</HI>; and, to
render the impo&s;itions of his father more
credible, he added many of his own.</P>
<P>Naud&eacute; &s;peaks thus concerning them&mdash;'They
&s;ay, in Italy, that Scaliger's father married, at
Agen, the daughter of an apothecary; though
others affirm, the ba&s;tard of a bi&s;hop:' pro|bably,
of the prelate he followed. 'His &s;on
Scaliger was vi&s;ited in the character of a <HI>Prince</HI>
at Leyden.'</P>
<P>By this, I think, it appears that Naud&eacute;
gives him credit for the principality; for he
&s;eems not in the lea&s;t to &s;mile at the ho|nour.</P>
<P>' The Duke de Nevers, having paid him a
vi&s;it, offered him a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, which
Scaliger civilly refu&s;ed.'</P>
<P>The pride of this &s;uppo&s;ititious Prince, who
was but a poor &s;tudent, mu&s;t have run high!</P>
<P>' Schioppius,' adds Naud&eacute;, 'mu&s;t have
<PB N="138" REF="153">
been under the influence of &s;ome demon when
he wrote &s;o bad a book again&s;t Scaliger:' yet
Menage ob&s;erves of this work, that Jo&s;eph
Scaliger died of the chagrin he felt on the
occa&s;ion of Schioppius's book being publi&s;hed,
entitled, <HI>Scaliger Hypobolymaeus.</HI></P>
<P>' Yet we may,' ob&s;erves Huet, '&s;ay, with
Lip&s;ius, that if the two Scaligers were not
actually Princes, they richly merited a princi|pality
for the beauty of their genius and the
extent of their erudition; but we can offer
no apology for their ridiculous and &s;ingular
haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>' When a friend was delineating his character,
the father wrote to him in the&s;e terms&mdash;"En|deavour
to collect whatever is mo&s;t beautiful in
the pages of Ma&s;ini&s;&s;a, of Xenophon, and of
Plato, and you may then form a portrait which,
however, will re&s;emble me but imperfectly."</P>
<P>Yet this man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little delicacy of ta&s;te,
as he evinces by the fal&s;e judgments he pa&s;&s;es
on Homer and Mu&s;aeus; and, above all, by
<PB N="139" REF="154">
tho&s;e unformed and rude poems with which
he has di&s;honoured Parna&s;&s;us. I have read
&s;omewhere a French &s;onnet by this man, which
is beneath critici&s;m. Menage &s;ays, that the
collection of Scaliger's poems, which forms a
thick octavo volume, will hardly find it's equal
for bad compo&s;ition, con&s;idering them as the
productions of a man of letters. Of a great
number of epigrams, there are but four or five
which are in the lea&s;t tolerable.</P>
<P>Huet thinks that his &s;on compo&s;ed tho&s;e
letters which pa&s;s under his name; and, as he
is an exqui&s;ite judge of &s;tyle, we &s;hould credit
his opinion. But, though his poetry is &s;o
de&s;titute of &s;pirit or grace, his pro&s;e, it mu&s;t
be allowed, is excellent: nothing can be more
noble, higher poli&s;hed, or more happily
turned.</P>
<P>The &s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a finer ta&s;te: his &s;tyle is
more flowing and ea&s;y, and yet is not the le&s;s
noble. His writings, like tho&s;e of the father,
breathe &s;ingular haughtine&s;s and malignity.
<PB N="140" REF="155">
The Scaligerana will convince us that he was
incapable of thinking or &s;peaking favourably
of any per&s;on. Although he has reflected
honour on his age by the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his
learning, we mu&s;t confe&s;s that he has not &s;el|dom
fallen into gro&s;s errors, even on tho&s;e
&s;ubjects to which he had mo&s;t applied. As
for in&s;tance, Chronology, which was his fa|vourite
&s;tudy; and although he imagined that
he &s;tretched the &s;ceptre over the realms of
Critici&s;m, no one has treated this topic with
le&s;s felicity. It was the reform of the Calendar
then pending at Rome which engaged him in
this &s;tudy. He wi&s;hed to &s;hew the world that
he was more capable than all tho&s;e who had
been employed. If the &s;ucce&s;s of this labour
had depended on the extent and variety of
erudition, he had eminently &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e
who had applied to this ta&s;k; but he was their
inferior in the &s;olidity of his judgment, in the
exactne&s;s of his arguments, and the profundity
of his &s;peculations. When he fondly believed
<PB N="141" REF="156">
that he had found the Quadrature of the Circle,
he was corrected, and turned into ridicule, by
an ob&s;cure &s;choolma&s;ter; who, having clearly
pointed out the paralogi&s;m which deceived him,
made his cyclometrics vani&s;h at his touch.</P>
<P>' Scaliger, the father, was,' &s;ays Patin, 'an
illu&s;trious impo&s;tor. He had never been at
any war, nor at any court of the Emperor
Maximilian, as he pretended. He pa&s;&s;ed the
fir&s;t thirty years of his life in one continued
&s;tudy. Afterwards, he threw off his monk's
frock, and palmed on all Europe the &s;ingular
impo&s;ition of his being a de&s;cendant of the
Princes of Verona, who bore the name of
Scaliger.</P>
<P>Julius Scaliger had this peculiarity in his
manner of compo&s;ition: he wrote with
&s;uch accuracy, that his manu&s;cript and the
printed copy always corre&s;ponded page for
page, and line for line. This may appear
trifling information; but I am per&s;uaded that
<PB N="142" REF="157">
a habit of correctne&s;s in the le&s;&s;er parts of com|po&s;ition
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the higher.</P>
<P>George P&s;almanazar, well known in the
literary world, exceeded in powers of decep|tion
any of the great impo&s;tors of learning.
His I&s;land of Formo&s;a was an illu&s;ion emi|nently
bold, and maintained with as much
felicity as erudition; and va&s;t mu&s;t have been
that erudition which could, on &s;cientific prin|ciples,
form a language and it's grammar.</P>

<HEAD>THE PORT ROYAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY lover of Letters mu&s;t have heard

<PB N="146" REF="161">
benefited by the labours of the&s;e learned Men:
but, perhaps, few have attended to their ori|gin,
and to their di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Society of the <HI>Port Royal des Champs&mdash;</HI>
that was the original title&mdash;took this name
from a valley about &s;ix leagues from Paris.</P>
<P>In the year 1637, <HI>Le Maitre,</HI> a celebrated
Advocate, renounced the Bar, and re&s;igned
the honour of being <HI>Con&s;eiller d'Etat,</HI> which
his uncommon merit had obtained him,
though then only twenty-eight years of age.
His brother, <HI>De Sericourt,</HI> who had followed
the military profe&s;&s;ion, quitted it at the &s;ame
time. Both con&s;ecrating them&s;elves to the
&s;ervice of God, they retired into a little hou&s;e
near <HI>the Port Royal</HI> of Paris. Their brothers,
<HI>De Sacy, De St. Elme,</HI> and <HI>De Valmont,</HI> joined
them. For &s;ome political rea&s;on, they were
con&s;trained to remove them&s;elves from that
&s;pot, and they then fixed their re&s;idence at
<HI>Port Royal des Champs.</HI> There again the
Court di&s;turbed them, after a re&s;idence of
<PB N="147" REF="162">
little more than two months; but, about a
year afterwards, they again returned.</P>
<P>With the&s;e illu&s;trious Reclu&s;es many per|&s;ons
of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit now retired: and
it was this Community which has been &s;ince
called <HI>the Society of Port Royal.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t the members, was the celebrated
Arnauld, and others, who&s;e names would re|flect
a lu&s;tre on any &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Here were no rules, no vows, no con&s;titu|tion,
and no cells formed. Prayer and &s;tudy
were their only occupations. They applied
them&s;elves to the education of young men,
and initiated the ri&s;ing generation into &s;cience
and into virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Racine</HI> here received his education; and,
on his death-bed, de&s;ired to be buried in the
cemetery of the Port Royal, at the feet of
M. Hamon. An amiable in&s;tance, this, of

<P><PB N="165" REF="180">
A Cardinal having cau&s;ed a &s;tatue to be
made at Rome, by the great <HI>Angelo,</HI> when it
was fini&s;hed, he came to in&s;pect it; and
having, for &s;ome time, &s;agaciou&s;ly con&s;idered
it, poring now on the face, then on the arms,
the knees, the form of the leg, and, at length,
on the foot it&s;elf; the &s;tatue being of &s;uch per|fect
beauty, he found him&s;elf at a lo&s;s to di&s;play
his powers of critici&s;m, but by lavi&s;hing his
prai&s;e. But he recollected, that only to prai&s;e,
might appear as if there had been an obtu&s;ene&s;s
in the keenne&s;s of his critici&s;m. He trembled to
find a fault, but a fault mu&s;t be found. At length,
he ventured to mutter &s;omething concerning
the no&s;e; it might, he thought, be &s;omething
more Grecian. <HI>Angelo</HI> differed from his Grace,
but he &s;aid he would attempt to gratify his
ta&s;te. He took up his chi&s;&s;el, and concealed
&s;ome marble-du&s;t in his hand; and, feigning to
retouch the part, he adroitly let fall &s;ome of the
du&s;t he held concealed. The Cardinal ob&s;erv|ing
it fall, tran&s;ported at the idea of his critical
<PB N="166" REF="181">
acumen, exclaimed&mdash;'Ah, <HI>Angelo!</HI> you have
now given to it an inimitable grace!'</P>
<P>When <HI>Pope</HI> was fir&s;t introduced to read his
Iliad to Lord Halifax, the noble Critic did not
venture to be di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;o perfect a
compo&s;ition: but, like the Cardinal, this pa&s;|&s;age,
and that word, this turn, and that expre&s;|&s;ion,
formed the broken cant of his critici&s;ms.
The hone&s;t Poet was &s;tung with vexation;
for, in general, the parts at which his lord&s;hip
he&s;itated, were tho&s;e of which he was mo&s;t &s;a|tisfied.
As he returned home with Sir Samuel
Garth, he revealed to him the anxiety of his
mind. 'Oh,' replied Garth, laughing,
'you are not &s;o well acquainted with his
lord&s;hip as my&s;elf; he mu&s;t critici&s;e. At your
next vi&s;it, read to him tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages as
they now &s;tand; tell him, that you have recol|lected

<HEAD>THE ART OF CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent French Writer has thus very
ingeniou&s;ly traced the origin of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>The Art of Critici&s;m is by no means a mo|dern
invention; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that
in the la&s;t age alone it hath reached it's pre|&s;ent
degree of perfection.</P>
<P>According to Dion Chry&s;o&s;tom, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>
is the inventor of Critici&s;m; it is, at lea&s;t, cer|tain
that it appeared about his time.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;tarchus,</HI> who flouri&s;hed at Samos, about
one hundred and fifty years before the Chri&s;|tian
Aera, wrote nine books of Corrections of
the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey, and &s;pread a general
alarm among&s;t the race of Authors; in&s;omuch
that, to the pre&s;ent day, a <HI>Critic,</HI> and an <HI>Ari|&s;tarchus,</HI>
are &s;ynonimous words.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183">
As the Sciences were, for a long time, neg|lected,
Critici&s;m &s;hared the &s;ame fate. There
were, however, even in the mo&s;t barbarous
ages, a few learned men who cultivated it. At
the re&s;toration of Letters, Critici&s;m, by the ef|forts
of many celebrated Scholars, &s;prung up
with new vigour. But two important events
contributed equally to the revival of Letters
and of Critici&s;m: the taking of Con&s;tantinople,
by the Turks, which occa&s;ioned &s;everal of the
learned to retire into Italy and France; and
the invention of Printing, which was di&s;covered
about that time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this admirable Art was made
public, they applied them&s;elves to publi&s;h|ing
excellent Editions of all the good Au|thors,
according to the mo&s;t correct Manu|&s;cripts.
They were indefatigable in their re|&s;earches
for the mo&s;t ancient copies, and they
collated them with the modern ones, by the
&s;tricte&s;t rules of Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Some formed <HI>Dictionaries</HI> and <HI>Grammars</HI> of
<PB N="169" REF="184">
different languages; and &s;ome <HI>Commentaries,</HI>
for illu&s;trating the Text. Others compo&s;ed
<HI>Treati&s;es</HI> on Fabulous Hi&s;tory, on the Religion,
Government, and the Military Operations of
the Ancients. They dwelt on the minute&s;t
particularities which concerned their Manners,
their Apparel, their Repa&s;ts, their Amu&s;ements,
&amp;c. In a word, they neglected nothing which,
after &s;o wide an interval, might throw new
lights on what remained of the Grecian and
the Roman Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The Learned of the Sixteenth Century made
new efforts, not only to clear the uncultivated
lands of the Republic of Letters, which had
remained unexplored by their predece&s;&s;ors, but
al&s;o to improve tho&s;e they had inherited. They
prided them&s;elves in the free&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; they
rummaged every library, to bring to light un|noticed
Manu&s;cripts; they compared them to|gether:
they arranged tho&s;e hi&s;torical facts
which were nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the texts, and
to &s;ix the dates; and they were careful, above
<PB N="170" REF="185">
all things, not to decide on the &s;en&s;e of a pa&s;|&s;age,
without a mature examination, and a
laborious collation.</P>
<P>Yet, after the immen&s;e labours of Ju&s;tus
Lip&s;ius, the Scaligers, Turnebus, Budaeus, Era&s;|mus,
and &s;o many other learned men, Critici&s;m
&s;till remained imperfect; and it is only in the
la&s;t age that it attained to the height which it
now has reached.</P>
<P>This perfection of Critici&s;m is owing to the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of ACADEMIES, particularly
tho&s;e of the French and the Belles Lettres
Academies. In their labours may be found
tho&s;e numerous and judicious Remarks, which
had e&s;caped the penetration of the fir&s;t Scho|lars
in Europe.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this Article, without ob&s;erving,
that it is much to the di&s;honour of the na|tional
character, no Academy, dedicated to the
BELLES LETTRES, has ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<HEAD>THE ABSENT MAN.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the character of Bruyere's Ab&s;ent
Man, it is probable, the reader is well ac|quainted.
It is tran&s;lated in the Spectator, and
it has been exhibited on the Theatre. The
general opinion runs, that it is a fictitious
character, or, at lea&s;t, one the Author has too
highly coloured: it was well known, however,
to his contemporaries, to be the Count De
<PB N="172" REF="187">
Brancas. The pre&s;ent Anecdotes concerning
the &s;ame per&s;on, have been unknown to, or
forgotten by, Bruyere; and, as they are un|doubtedly
genuine, and, at the &s;ame time,
to the full as extraordinary as tho&s;e which
characterize <HI>Menalcas,</HI> or the Ab&s;ent Man; it
is but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the character,
however improbable it may appear, is a faith|ful
delineation from Nature.</P>
<P>One day, when the Count was walking in
the &s;treet, the Duke de la Rochefoucault
cro&s;&s;ed the way, to &s;peak to him. 'God ble&s;s
thee, poor man!' exclaimed the Count. Ro|chefoucault
&s;miled, and was beginning to ad|dre&s;s
him&mdash;'Is it not enough,' cried the
Count, interrupting him, and &s;omewhat in a
pa&s;&s;ion; 'is it not enough that I have &s;aid,
at fir&s;t, I have nothing for you? Such lazy
beggars as you hinder a gentleman from walk|ing
the &s;treets.' Rochefoucault bur&s;t into a
loud laugh; and awakening the Ab&s;ent Man
from his lethargy, he was not a little &s;urprized,
<PB N="173" REF="188">
him&s;elf, that he &s;hould take his friend for an
importunate mendicant!</P>
<P>The Count was reading by the fire-&s;ide, but
Heaven knows with what degree of attention,
when the nur&s;e brought him his infant-child.
He throws down the book; he takes the child
in his arms&mdash;he was playing with her, when
an important vi&s;itor was announced. Having
forgot he had quitted his book, and that it was
his child he held in his hands, he threw her
down violently on the table; and, probably,
was &s;urprized to hear loud cries i&s;&s;ue from his
book.</P>

&s;hould they even convey to the reader their
meaning, they mu&s;t offend?&mdash;Such as tho&s;e
which a fanatical Preacher employed, when
he called on the Lord to wipe his lips with
the <HI>napkin</HI> of his love; and when he talked of
the <HI>lamp</HI> of love, and the <HI>candle</HI> of divine
grace.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Latimer preached, in the year 1527,
a &s;ermon, in which he &s;ays&mdash;'Now, ye have
heard what is meant by this <HI>fir&s;t card,</HI> and how
ye ought to <HI>play:</HI> I purpo&s;e again to <HI>deal</HI> unto
you another <HI>card</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>&s;uit</HI>; for they be
of &s;o nigh affinity, that one cannot be <HI>well
played</HI> without the other.'</P>
<P>About the middle of the Seventeenth Cen|tury,
a country mini&s;ter&mdash;Fuller informs us&mdash;imitated the&s;e ridiculous allu&s;ions of Latimer;
<PB N="175" REF="190">
but the congregation, now &s;omewhat more re|fined
than in the good Bi&s;hop's time, could not
refrain from immoderate peals of laughter.</P>
<P>Perron ob&s;erves, that in employing <HI>Meta|phors,</HI>
we mu&s;t not de&s;cend from the <HI>general</HI>
to the <HI>particular:</HI> we may be allowed to &s;ay&mdash;the <HI>flames</HI> of love, but not the <HI>candle,</HI> the
<HI>lamp,</HI> and the <HI>wick</HI> of love. Saint An&s;elm
exclaims&mdash;'<HI>Draw</HI> me, O Lord! that I may
<HI>run</HI> after thee; fa&s;ten me with the <HI>cords</HI> of thy
Love!' The <HI>Metaphor</HI> is a little &s;imilitude, or
an abridgment of a &s;imilitude&mdash;it mu&s;t pa&s;s
quick; we mu&s;t not dwell upon it; when it
is too far continued, it is vicious, and degene|rates
into an <HI>Enigma.</HI></P>
<P>Pere Bouhours al&s;o ob&s;erves, that Meta|phors
mu&s;t not be continued too far, and
that when they are thus over&s;trained, they be|come
trifling and frigid. The&s;e two in&s;tances
will explain what is here meant&mdash;</P>
<P>An Italian, on his return from Poland, &s;aid,
that the per&s;ons of that country were as white
<PB N="176" REF="191">
as their &s;nows; but, that they were even colder
than they were white; and that frequently,
from their conver&s;ations, he caught a <HI>cold.</HI></P>
<P>Co&s;tar &s;ays, that the Lectures of Malherbe
were &s;atiating and cloying to a degre&mdash;&s;o as to
de&s;troy the <HI>appetite</HI> of tho&s;e who heard them,
and to &s;ave them the expence of a <HI>dinner.</HI></P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t it is to be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Cold,</HI> as
a figure, is an e&s;tabli&s;hed Metaphor; but that
from this cold we are likely to catch one, is
what pa&s;&s;es the ju&s;t limits of the Metaphor, as
well as tho&s;e lectures, which cloyed till they
occa&s;ioned a lo&s;s of appetite, and &s;aved the ex|pence
of a dinner.</P>
<P>It was &s;aying enough, that they were &s;atiating
and di&s;agreeable, without adding the re&s;t, which
goes to &s;uch an extreme, and which is not
likely. This, however, mu&s;t be under&s;tood,
when the Author &s;peaks in a &s;erious &s;tyle:
for, if he means to employ &s;uch Metaphors
with levity, and in joking, they would then
not &s;hock us; becau&s;e, when we laugh, we
<PB N="177" REF="192">
may be allowed great latitude; and, according
to Ari&s;totle and Quintilian, whenever we

I had remarked, in reading Gibbon, two
matters, in which he has been gro&s;sly mi&s;ta|ken.
One was, the Standard of our Engli&s;h Coin,
when he compares it, in a note, with that of
&s;ome Foreign Coin he had to e&s;timate. The
other point was, when, in &s;peaking of a Reli|gious
Sect who u&s;ed to fa&s;t on certain days,
he adds&mdash;'They probably derived this cu&s;tom
from that of the Jews fa&s;ting on their Sab|bath.'
This is a flagrant error; &s;ince it has
always been their cu&s;tom, rather to indulge
in fe&s;tal enjoyments on that day. It is, with
them, a rule to ob&s;erve no Fa&s;t on the Sabbath,
though it might be the anniver&s;ary of the mo&s;t
remarkable event. The day of Expiation is
the only Fa&s;t permitted to be kept on the
Seventh day. I have endeavoured to find out
the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, but have hitherto been un&s;uc|ce&s;sful:
I am certain, however, my memory
does not mi&s;lead me.</P>

<HEAD>INNOVATION.</HEAD>
<P>To the &s;ame ingenious friend I am indebted
for the pre&s;ent, and two &s;ub&s;equent Articles.</P>
<P>The following &s;hort extract from a French
Writer, about the year 1500, may &s;erve to
&s;hew, that the cry again&s;t <HI>Innovation</HI> is not
peculiar to the Clergy of the pre&s;ent day, even
again&s;t the opinions of the mo&s;t moderate
among&s;t their own body.</P>
<P>' Such per&s;ons were the brave Bi&s;hops of
the Lionnois, who a&s;&s;embled a Synod to re|form
the regulations of Saint Anthony in that
Province. The Monks of that place were
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of the <HI>Hogs of Saint
Anthony</HI>: they afflicted them&s;elves with the
pains of making <HI>eight repa&s;ts</HI> in one day, to
&s;hew the weakne&s;s of Human Nature!</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Je&s;uits, and &s;ome young
Bi&s;hops, who made fine harangues, and long
ones too, to demon&s;trate that <HI>&s;uch con&s;titutions</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="195">
admit of change, <HI>habit&acirc; ratione temporum:</HI>
that what our <HI>ance&s;tors</HI> had done with a good
intention, was, at this day, ridiculous. But
to all the&s;e <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> the <HI>Sub-Prior</HI> of Saint
Anthony only replied, &s;noring, with this
grave and remarkable &s;entence&mdash;<HI>Let us keep
our&s;elves, in our time, from novelties.</HI></P>
<P>The conte&s;t was renewed with vigour on the
other &s;ide: but the <HI>Sub-Prior,</HI> with his triple
chin, per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame argument; &s;tammer|ing
out&mdash;<HI>Let us keep&mdash;let us keep&mdash;keep our|&s;elves&mdash;</HI>&amp;c.</P>
<P>However &s;illy this reply of our well-fed

the force to re&s;i&s;t all the &s;alutary reforms
which Rea&s;on and Good-&s;en&s;e &s;o loudly call
for in In&s;titutions not only rendered <HI>ob&s;olete</HI>

<HEAD>ON THE CUSTOM OF SALUTING AFTER

<P>SOME Catholics&mdash;&s;ays Father Feyjoo&mdash;have

many ages prior to Saint Gregory; and it is
related, in a Memoir of the French Academy
of Sciences, to have been found practi&s;ed in
the New World, on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of Ame|rica.
This is not only &s;aid to be a fact, but
&s;ome Writers al&s;o give us an amu&s;ing account

' A Student at Law, who &s;tudied at Poitiers,
had tolerably improved him&s;elf in ca&s;es of

Learning, but his chief deficiency was a want

His father pa&s;&s;ing by Poitiers, recom|mended
him to read aloud, and to render his

To obey the injunctions of his father, he deter|mined
to read at the <HI>Mini&s;tery.</HI> In order to obtain
a certain a&s;&s;urance, he went every day into a

grew a great number of fine large cabbages.
Thus, for a long time, as he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies,
he went to repeat his le&s;&s;on to the&s;e cabbages,
addre&s;&s;ing them by the title of <HI>Gentlemen</HI>;
and dealing out his &s;entences, as if they had
compo&s;ed an audience of Scholars at a Lec|ture.

<P>As late as the days of Mrs. Manley, the

a mo&s;t &s;ingular delu&s;ion of Alchymy. The
recollection, whether it was her&s;elf, or ano|ther
per&s;on, on whom it was practi&s;ed, has
now e&s;caped me. From the circum&s;tances, it
is very probable, the Sage was not le&s;s de|ceived
than his Patrone&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="211">
It appears, that an infatuated lover of this
delu&s;ive Art met with one who pretended to
have the power of tran&s;muting Lead to Gold.
This Hermetic Philo&s;opher required only the
materials, and time, to perform his golden
operations. He was taken to the country re&s;i|dence
of his Patrone&s;s: a long laboratory was
built; and, that his labours might not be im|peded
by any di&s;turbance, no one was permit|ted
to enter into it. His door was contrived
to turn round on a &s;pring; &s;o that, un&s;een, and
un&s;eeing, his meals were conveyed to him,
without di&s;tracting the &s;ublime contemplations
of the Sage.</P>
<P>During a re&s;idence of two years, he never
conde&s;cended to &s;peak but two or three times
in the year to his infatuated Patrone&s;s. When
&s;he was admitted into the Laboratory, &s;he &s;aw,
with plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;tills, immen&s;e
cauldrons, long flues, and three or four Vul|canian
fires blazing at different corners of this
magical mine; nor did &s;he behold with le&s;s
<PB N="197" REF="212">
reverence the venerable figure of the du&s;ty
Philo&s;opher. Pale and emaciated, with daily
operations and nightly vigils, he revealed to
her, in unintelligible jargon, his progre&s;&s;es:
and, having &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to ex|plain
the my&s;teries of the Arcana, &s;he beheld,
or &s;eemed to behold, &s;treams of fluid, and heaps
of &s;olid Ore, &s;cattered around the laboratory.
Sometimes he required a new &s;till, and &s;ome|times,
va&s;t quantities of lead. Already this
unfortunate lady had expended the half of her
fortune, in &s;upplying the demands of the Phi|lo&s;opher.
She began, now, to lower her ima|gination
to the &s;tandard of Rea&s;on. Two
years had now elap&s;ed, va&s;t quantities of lead
had gone in, and nothing but lead had come
out. She di&s;clo&s;ed her &s;entiments to the Philo&s;o|pher.
He candidly confe&s;&s;ed, he was him&s;elf &s;ur|prized
at his tardy proce&s;&s;es; but that now he
would exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, and that he
would venture to perform a laborious opera|tion
which, hitherto, he had hoped not to

retired, and the golden vi&s;ions of Ex|pectation
re&s;umed all their lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>One day, as they &s;at at dinner, a terrible
&s;hriek, and one crack followed by another,
loud as the report of cannon, a&s;&s;ailed their ears.
They ha&s;tened to the laboratory: two of the
greate&s;t Stills had bur&s;t; one part of the labo|ratory
was in flames, and the deluded Philo&s;o|pher
&s;corched to death!</P>

an Alchymical &s;peculation.</P>
<P>' The late Duke of Buckingham, being
over-per&s;uaded by a pack of knaves, who called
them&s;elves Chemical Operators, that they had
the &s;ecret of producing the Philo&s;opher's Stone,
but wanted money to carry on the proce&s;s; his
Grace engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with money to
carry on the work, and performed his promi&s;e
at a va&s;t expence. A laboratory was built,
uten&s;ils provided, and the family filled with
<PB N="199" REF="214">
the mo&s;t famous Arti&s;ts in the tran&s;mutation
of Metals&mdash;Adepts of a &s;uperior cla&s;s, who
would concern them&s;elves only about the
grand Elixir, and a pack of &s;habby curs, to
attend the fires, and do other &s;ervile offices;
and yet, for&s;ooth, mu&s;t be al&s;o called Philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>' This great charge continued upon the Duke
for &s;ome years; for, whoever was unpaid, or
whatever was neglected, money mu&s;t be found
to bear the charge of the laboratory, and pay
the Operators; till this chimera, with other ex|travagancies,
had cau&s;ed the mortgaging and
&s;elling many fine Manors, Lord&s;hips, Towns,
and good Farms.</P>
<P>' All this time, nothing was produced by
the&s;e &s;ons of Art of any value; for, either the
gla&s;s broke, or the man was drunk and let
out the fire, or &s;ome other misfortune, &s;till at|tended
the grand proce&s;s, at the time a&s;&s;igned
for a <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi</HI> to be produced, that mu&s;t
turn all things to gold. The Duke encounter|ing
<PB N="200" REF="215">
nothing but di&s;appointments, and the
Operators finding them&s;elves &s;lighted, and
money very difficult to be had, the project
fell!'</P>
<P>Penotus, who died at ninety-eight years of
age, in the Ho&s;pital of Sierdon in Switzer|land,
had &s;pent nearly his whole life in re|&s;earches
after the Philo&s;opher's Stone; and be|ing,
at length, from affluent circum&s;tances,
reduced to beggary and rea&s;on, was accu&s;tomed
to &s;ay&mdash;'That if he had a mortal enemy, that
he dur&s;t not encounter openly, he would ad|vi&s;e
him, above all things, to give him&s;elf
up to the &s;tudy and practice of Alchymy.'</P>
<P>Every philo&s;ophical mind mu&s;t be convinced
that Alchymy is not an art, which &s;ome have
fancifully traced to the <HI>remote&s;t times</HI>; it may
be rather regarded, when oppo&s;ed to &s;uch a
di&s;tance of time, as a modern impo&s;ture. Cae&s;ar
commanded the treati&s;es of Alchymy to be
burnt throughout the Roman dominions; and
this &s;hews the opinion of one who is not le&s;s
<PB N="201" REF="216">
to be admired as a Philo&s;opher than as a Mo|narch.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon has this &s;uccinct pa&s;&s;age relative
to Alchymy&mdash;'The ancient books of Alchymy,
&s;o liberally a&s;cribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon,
or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more
recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentive
either to the u&s;e or the abu&s;e of Chymi&s;try.
In that immen&s;e Regi&s;ter, where Pliny has de|po&s;ited
the di&s;coveries, the arts, and the errors,
of mankind, there is not the lea&s;t mention of
the tran&s;mutations of metals; and the per&s;e|cution
of Diocle&s;ian is the fir&s;t authentic event
in the hi&s;tory of Alchymy. The conque&s;t of
Egypt, by the Arabs, diffu&s;ed that vain &s;cience
over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of
the human heart, it was &s;tudied in China, as
in Europe, with equal eagerne&s;s and equal
&s;ucce&s;s. The darkne&s;s of the middle ages en|&s;ured
a favourable reception to every tale of
wonder; and the revival of learning gave new
vigour to hope, and &s;ugge&s;ted more &s;pecious
<PB N="202" REF="217">
arts to deception. Philo&s;ophy, with the aid
of experience, has at length bani&s;hed the &s;tudy
of Alchymy; and the pre&s;ent age, however
de&s;irous of riches, is content to &s;eek them by
the humbler means of commerce and in|du&s;try.'</P>
<P>After this, will it be credited that, even in
this enlightened age, a writer &s;hould &s;tand
forth as it's advocate? Mr. Andrews, in his
Anecdotes, has an article concerning Alchymy.
His account of Nicholas Flamel is not accurate.
He attributes 'his my&s;terious pro&s;perity to
that <HI>great &s;ecret</HI> which has been &s;ought for
through ages, and which, <HI>to this day,</HI> has it's
<HI>believers.</HI>' Of the&s;e <HI>believers,</HI> undoubtedly, Mr.
Andrews is one!</P>

<P>THE Athenians e&s;tabli&s;hed a Tribunal, com|po&s;ed

him&s;elf, by &s;upplicating the Critics pa|tiently

<P>If &s;uch a Tribunal of Critici&s;m was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed

<P>One Walfon a&s;&s;ured George Weller, who

Bapti&s;te Porta; in which the author &s;hews,
that the <HI>lines</HI> in the hand are <HI>letters,</HI> of which
he pre&s;ents the reader with an <HI>alphabet.</HI></P>
<P>The following curious phy&s;iological definition
<PB N="211" REF="226">
of PHYSIOGNOMY is extracted from a Publi|cation
by Dr. Gwither, of the year 1604&mdash;</P>
<P>' Soft wax cannot receive more various and
numerous impre&s;&s;ions than are imprinted on a
man's face by <HI>objects</HI> moving his affections:
and not only the <HI>objects</HI> them&s;elves have this
power, but al&s;o the very <HI>images</HI> or <HI>ideas</HI>; that
is to &s;ay, any thing that puts the animal &s;pirits
into the &s;ame motion that the <HI>object</HI> pre&s;ent did,
will have the &s;ame effect with the object. To
prove the fir&s;t, let one ob&s;erve a man's face
looking on a pitiful object, then a ridiculous,
then a &s;trange, then on a terrible or dangerous
object, and &s;o forth. For the &s;econd, that <HI>ideas</HI>
have the &s;ame effect with the <HI>object,</HI> dreams
confirm too often.</P>
<P>' The manner I conceive to be thus&mdash;The
animal &s;pirits, moved in the &s;en&s;ory by an
object, continue their motion to the brain;
whence the motion is propagated to this or
that particular part of the body, as is mo&s;t
&s;uitable to the de&s;ign of it's creation; having
<PB N="212" REF="227">
fir&s;t made an alteration in the <HI>face</HI> by it's
nerves, e&s;pecially by the <HI>pathetic</HI> and <HI>oculorum
motorii</HI> actuating it's many mu&s;cles, as the dial|plate
to that &s;tupendous piece of clock-work,
which &s;hews what is to be expected next from
the &s;triking part. Not that I think the motion
of the &s;pirits in the &s;en&s;ory continued by the
impre&s;&s;ion of the object all the way, as from
a finger to the foot: I know it too weak, though
the ten&s;ene&s;s of the nerves favours it. But I
conceive it done in the medulla of the brain,
where is the common &s;tock of &s;pirits; as in an
organ, who&s;e pipes being uncovered, the air
ru&s;hes into them; but the keys, let go, are
&s;topped again. Now, if by repeated acts, or
frequent entertaining of the ideas of a favourite
idea of a pa&s;&s;ion or vice which natural tem|perament
has hurried one to, or cu&s;tom dragged,
the <HI>face</HI> is &s;o often put into that po&s;ture which
attends &s;uch acts, that the animal &s;pirits find
&s;uch latent pa&s;&s;ages into it's nerves, that it is
&s;ometimes unalterably &s;et: as the <HI>Indian</HI> Re|ligious
<PB N="213" REF="228">
are, by long continuing in &s;trange
po&s;tures in their <HI>Pagods.</HI> But, mo&s;t commonly,
&s;uch a habit is contracted, that it falls in&s;en&s;ibly
into that po&s;ture, when &s;ome pre&s;ent object
does not obliterate that more natural impre&s;&s;ion
by a new, or di&s;&s;imulation hide it.</P>
<P>' Hence it is that we &s;ee great <HI>drinkers</HI> with
<HI>eyes</HI> generally &s;et towards the no&s;e, the adducent
mu&s;cles being often employed to let them &s;ee
their loved liquor in the gla&s;s at the time of
drinking; which were, therefore, called <HI>bibi|tory.
La&s;civious per&s;ons</HI> are remarkable for the

it. From this al&s;o we may &s;olve the <HI>Quaker's</HI>

and the melancholy face of the <HI>Sectaries</HI>;
the <HI>&s;tudious</HI> face of men of great application of
mind; revengeful and <HI>bloody men,</HI> like execu|tioners
in the act: and though &s;ilence, in a
&s;ort, may awhile pa&s;s for wi&s;dom, yet, &s;ooner
or later, Saint Martin peeps through the di&s;|gui&s;e,

from the bottom to the top. The rent
mu&s;t be of a particular length. When it is
done for the lo&s;s of parents, it is never &s;ewed;
for the lo&s;s of other per&s;ons, it is &s;ewed at the

<P>Among the great number of writers who
have attempted to di&s;cover the &s;en&s;e of the
Enigmas, and the fooli&s;h and extravagant Vi|&s;ions
with which this Work is loaded, there
have been &s;ome, who imagined that they per|ceived
many remarkable events, which were
predicted in this Book. Others have led their

<P>' If it is difficult'&mdash;&s;ays De Bure&mdash;'to give
a ju&s;t idea of this extravagant Work, it is,
however, more ea&s;y to inform the reader of
it's rarity. It has been long known among&s;t
the Literary <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eurs</HI>; and it is certain,
that nothing is more difficult than to find a
compleat copy. Some curious Collectors have
endeavoured, by &s;acrificing a great number of
copies, to join it's &s;eparate parts; but they
have always found their endeavours fru&s;trated.

<P>This rare Volume Con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;according to

makes in &s;ome of his pieces; where he puts
not only the name and the quality of tho&s;e to
whom he pre&s;ented them, but al&s;o the &s;ums
which he received from each individual.'</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; Ladvocat has given the following
&s;uccinct account of this man&mdash;'He knew the
art of gaining his livelihood by di&s;tributing his

but the truth is, they are vi&s;ions which come
from a head le&s;s ridiculous than tho&s;e of the

<P>After what has been laid before the reader,
will it be believed that a compleat collection of

<HEAD>IMPOSITIONS OF AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE have been &s;ome Authors who have
practi&s;ed &s;ingular Impo&s;itions on the public.
Varillas, the French Hi&s;torian, enjoyed for
&s;ome time a great reputation in his own coun|try
for his Hi&s;toric Compo&s;itions. When they
<PB N="224" REF="239">
became more known, the &s;cholars of other
countries de&s;troyed the reputation he had un|ju&s;tly
acquired. 'His continual profe&s;&s;ions
of &s;incerity prejudiced many in his favour,
and made him pa&s;s for a writer who had pene|trated
into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the cabinet:
but the public were at length undeceived, and
were convinced that the Hi&s;torical Anecdotes,
which Varillas put off for authentic facts, had
no foundation, being wholly his own invent|ing!&mdash;though he endeavoured to make them
pa&s;s for realities, by affected citations of titles,
in&s;tructions, letters, memoirs, and relations, all
of them imaginary!'</P>
<P>Melchi&s;edec Thevenot, Librarian to the
French king, was never out of Europe; yet
he has compo&s;ed &s;ome folio volumes of his
'Voyages and Travels,' by information and
memoirs, which he collected from tho&s;e who
had travelled. 'Travels,' ob&s;erves the Com|piler
of the Biographical Dictionary, 'related
at &s;econd hand, can never be of any great au|thority
<PB N="225" REF="240">
or moment.' A&s;&s;uredly not; but they
may be pregnant with errors of all kinds.</P>
<P>Gemelli Carreri, a Neapolitan gentleman,
who, for many years, never quitted his cham|ber,
being confined by a tedious indi&s;po&s;ition,
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with writing a voyage round
the world; giving characters of Men, and de|&s;criptions
of Countries, as if he had really
vi&s;ited them. Du Halde, who has written &s;o
voluminous an account of China, compiled it
from the Memoirs of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and
never travelled ten leagues from Pairs in his
life; though he appears, by his writings, to
be very familiar with the Chine&s;e &s;cenery.</P>
<P>This is an excellent ob&s;ervation of an ano|nymous
Author. '<HI>Writers</HI> who never vi&s;ited
foreign countries, and <HI>Travellers</HI> who have
run through immen&s;e regions with fleeting
pace, have given us long accounts of various
Countries and People; evidently collected from
the idle reports and ab&s;urd traditions of the
ignorant vulgar, from whom only they could

<P>To render a <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> perfect, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to attend to the&s;e rules.&mdash;The Tran&s;lator
mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a thorough knowledge of the two

giving the thoughts of his Author, but even
his own words, when they become e&s;&s;ential and
nece&s;&s;ary. He mu&s;t pre&s;erve the &s;pirit and pe|culiar

every character by it's manners and it's

with &s;uitable phra&s;es and parallel expre&s;&s;ions.
He mu&s;t yield beauties by other beauties, and
<PB N="227" REF="242">

of Language does not admit of a clo&s;e ver&s;ion.
He mu&s;t not employ long Sentences, unle&s;s
they &s;erve to render the &s;en&s;e more intelligible,
and the diction more elegant. He mu&s;t at|tempt
a neatne&s;s in his manner; and, to ef|fect
this, he mu&s;t know &s;kilfully to contract or
enlarge his Periods. He mu&s;t unite the too
conci&s;e Sentences of his Author, if his &s;tyle,
like that of Tacitus, be clo&s;e and abrupt. He
mu&s;t not only &s;edulou&s;ly attempt preci&s;ion
and purity of diction, but he mu&s;t &s;trive al&s;o
to embelli&s;h his ver&s;ion with tho&s;e graces and
images which frequently lie &s;o clo&s;ely hidden,
that nothing but a familiar conver&s;ancy with
his Author can di&s;cover them. And, la&s;tly, he
mu&s;t pre&s;ent us with the &s;entiments of his
Author, without a &s;ervile attachment to his
words or phra&s;es, but rather, according to his
&s;pirit and his genius.</P>
<P>A Tran&s;lator is a Painter who labours after
an original. He mu&s;t carefully reveal the <HI>traits</HI>

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIO|DICAL
LITERATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE New&s;papers of the pre&s;ent day, con|tra&s;ted
with their original models, have attain|ed
a degree of excellence which is flattering
to modern indu&s;try to contemplate. While
political events are regi&s;tered with a celerity
unknown to our ance&s;tors, the &s;entiments of
liberty are di&s;&s;eminated in the warm impre&s;|&s;ion
of the moment. The frivolous pur&s;uits
of the age offer an ample field to tho&s;e who
can point with force the keenne&s;s of Ridicule.
Fa&s;hion, however ver&s;atile, cannot e&s;cape the
eye of the &s;atiri&s;t; and the follies of the night
are chronicled for the &s;ober contemplation of
the morning. Literature has been called in to
<PB N="229" REF="244">
embelli&s;h the&s;e diurnal pages; and it has given
a &s;tability and perfection of which the evane&s;|cent
nature of &s;uch productions was hardly
thought &s;u&s;ceptible. It is, however, a melan|choly
truth, that &s;uch excellent purpo&s;es have
been fru&s;trated by a vile &s;pirit of faction; a
&s;pirit that, according to the &s;en&s;ible <HI>Rapin,</HI>
will &s;ooner overturn the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution
than the united efforts of our mo&s;t powerful
enemies. But &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions we leave to the
&s;agacious politicians.</P>
<P>Periodical Papers &s;eem fir&s;t to have been
u&s;ed by the Engli&s;h during the Civil Wars of
the u&s;urper Cromwell, to di&s;&s;eminate among&s;t
the people the &s;entiments of Loyalty or Rebel|lion,
according as their Authors were di&s;po&s;ed.
We &s;eem to have been obliged to the Italians
for the idea; and, perhaps, it was their <HI>Ga|zettas</HI>&mdash;from <HI>Gazzera,</HI> a magpie or chatter|er&mdash;which have given a name to the&s;e Pa|pers.
Hone&s;t <HI>Peter Heylin,</HI> in the preface to
his <HI>Co&s;mography,</HI> mentions that&mdash;'the affairs
of each Town, or War, were better pre|&s;ented
<PB N="230" REF="245">
to the reader in the <HI>Weekly News-Books.</HI>'
In their origin they were &s;olely devoted to
political purpo&s;es: but they &s;oon became a
public nui&s;ance, by &s;erving as receptacles
of party malice, and echoing to the farthe&s;t
ends of the kingdom the in&s;olent voice of Fac|tion.
They &s;et the minds of Men more at va|riance,
enflamed their tempers to a greater
fiercene&s;s, and gave a keener edge to the &s;harp|ne&s;s
of civil di&s;cord.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that &s;uch works will
always find writers adapted to their &s;currilous
purpo&s;es; but of a va&s;t crowd that i&s;&s;ued from
the pre&s;s, though little more than a century
has elap&s;ed, they are now not to be found but
in a few private Collections. They form a
race of Authors unknown to mo&s;t readers of
the&s;e times: the name of their Chief, however,
has ju&s;t reached us, but is on the point of
di&s;appearing.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Roger L'E&s;trange,</HI> who appears to have
greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his rivals, and to have been
<PB N="231" REF="246">
e&s;teemed as the mo&s;t perfect model of political
writing, merits little prai&s;e. The temper of
the man was factious and brutal, and the com|po&s;itions
of the Author very indifferent. In
his multifarious productions, and meagre
tran&s;lations, we di&s;cover nothing that indicates
one amiable &s;entiment, to compen&s;ate for a
barbarous diction, and a heavy load of poli|tical
tra&s;h. His attempts at Wit are clum&s;y
exertions; the aukward efforts of a German
who labours on a delicate toy. When he a&s;|&s;umes
the gravity of the &s;age, he &s;eems more
fortunate in extorting a laugh; burle&s;quing
the mo&s;t &s;olemn reflections by quaint and un|couth
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the reign of <HI>Queen Anne</HI>&mdash;not unju&s;tly
characterized by being di&s;tingui&s;hed as the
Augu&s;tan Age of Engli&s;h Literature&mdash;Periodi|cal
Prints, that till then had only &s;erved po|litical
purpo&s;es, began to rank higher in the
e&s;timation of the Public. Some had already
attempted to introduce literary &s;ubjects, and
<PB N="232" REF="247">
other topics of a more general &s;peculation. But
we &s;ee nothing that has e&s;caped the wa&s;te of
time, till <HI>Sir Richard Steele</HI> formed the plan
of his <HI>Tatler.</HI> He de&s;igned it to embrace the
three provinces, of Manners, of Letters, and
of Politics. He knew that this was an in|valuable
improvement; and, doubtle&s;s, he
thought, that if the la&s;t portion could be omit|ted,
it would &s;till have made it more perfect.
But violent and &s;udden reformation is &s;el|dom
to be u&s;ed; and the Public were to be
conducted in&s;en&s;ibly into &s;o new and different
a track from that to which they had been
hitherto accu&s;tomed. Hence Politics were ad|mitted
into his Paper. But it remained for the
cha&s;ter genius of <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> to bani&s;h this di&s;a|greeable
topic from his elegant pages. The
writer in Polite Letters felt him&s;elf degraded
by &s;inking into the dull narrator of Political
Events. It is from this time, that New&s;papers
and periodical Literature became di&s;tinct
works.</P>

<PB N="233" REF="248">
<HEAD>LITERARY COMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>IN a little Tract, printed in 1681, is to be
found &s;ome curious literary information. The
ingenious author attempts to mark out the
mo&s;t profitable way of reading and writing
books. He fir&s;t informs us of various vo|luminous
writers; of &s;ome, &s;o infected with
the <HI>cacoethes &s;cribendi,</HI> that they have compo&s;ed
from &s;ix to &s;even thou&s;and volumes! He then
notices va&s;t libraries; &s;uch as that of Ptolomy,
King of Egypt, which was &s;aid to contain
four hundred thou&s;and; or, as others write,
&s;even hundred thou&s;and volumes: and al&s;o that
of the younger Theodo&s;ius at Con&s;tantinople,
containing ten myriads of books.</P>
<P>He reflects that, &s;ince the invention of print|ing,
an Author can publi&s;h as much in <HI>one day</HI>
as he has compo&s;ed in <HI>one year.</HI> He laments,
that the&s;e multifarious volumes may prove pre|judicial
<PB N="234" REF="249">
to the Student; that &s;uch a continued
novelty of matter will render his knowledge
le&s;s clear and dige&s;ted than before this inven|tion
took place: though he is willing to allow
that this evil originates rather from the ill u&s;e
made of books, than from their number.</P>
<P>He complains&mdash;a complaint, I fear, which
mu&s;t ever exi&s;t&mdash;that the pre&s;s is continually
pouring forth trivial, crude, and u&s;ele&s;s per|formances:
yet he ob&s;erves&mdash;'If men would
take care that ill books be not written, and that
good books be not ill written, but that in their
compo&s;ition a due regard be always had to
<HI>prudence, &s;olidity, per&s;picuity,</HI> and <HI>brevity,</HI> there
would be no cau&s;e left for us to complain of
the too great number of books.'</P>
<P>By the idea of <HI>prudence,</HI> he would have us
under&s;tand, that an Author &s;hould never ra&s;hly
or incon&s;iderately apply him&s;elf to compo&s;i|tion:
let him learn well what he purpo&s;es to
teach to others. The greate&s;t Scholars have
always taken time to make their compo&s;itions
<PB N="235" REF="250">
approach perfection. I&s;ocrates &s;pent ten, or,
as &s;ome will have it, fifteen years, in poli&s;hing
one Panegyric. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius employed twelve
years in writing his Hi&s;tory, and ten years in
preparing his Memoirs. Virgil employed &s;e|ven
years to fini&s;h his Bucolics; and, after a
labour of eleven years, pronounced his Aeneid
imperfect. Jacobus Sannazarius wrote three
books <HI>de Partu Virginis,</HI> and dedicated twenty
years to this labour. Diodorus Siculus was
thirty years in compo&s;ing his Hi&s;tory. Hence
he advi&s;es writers to reflect on the reply of
Zeuxis to one who boa&s;ted of a more fluent
hand in painting&mdash;<HI>Diu pingo, quia eternitati
pingo</HI>&mdash;'I paint but a line every day; but I
paint for po&s;terity.'</P>
<P>In works of importance, he would have us
be &s;tudious of what he calls <HI>&s;olidity.</HI> He means,
that our arguments &s;hould be forcibly urged,
and &s;kilfully applied; that every thing we
write tend to &s;hew that we feel our&s;elves the
conviction of what we would convince our
<PB N="236" REF="251">
reader; that nothing be feeble, doubtful, or
frivolous; that truth be firm, clear, and as in|di&s;putable
as po&s;&s;ible. 'Not,' as he candidly
remarks, 'that this <HI>&s;olidity</HI> can be every where
ob&s;erved alike, it being above the infirmity of
man &s;o to do; but men &s;hould be very wary
not to flatter them&s;elves that others will be|lieve
their bare &s;ay-&s;o's.'</P>
<P>By <HI>per&s;picuity,</HI> he requires that the &s;tyle
&s;erve like a mirror to the mind of the Author;
&s;o that the &s;en&s;e may be lucidly pre&s;ented to
the reader. As for tho&s;e Authors who are
plea&s;ed to throw over their compo&s;itions an
affected ob&s;curity, he &s;hrewdly remarks, that
they might gratify their humour and the
world much better by remaining &s;ilent.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, he would not have <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> &s;o far
indulged as to neglect <HI>brevity.</HI> 'For, as ob|&s;curity
makes a book u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o, if drawn out
in length, it becomes tedious.' To ob&s;erve
this <HI>brevity,</HI> he advi&s;es the writer not to give
into wild digre&s;&s;ions, but always 'to keep clo&s;e
<PB N="237" REF="252">
to his main &s;ubject;' to reject, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, trite &s;entiments and familiar argu|ments;
to be &s;paring of an idle amplification
of words; and, in controver&s;y, not &s;o much to
combat his adver&s;aries by number as by weight
of argument.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this &s;light Review, which, I hope,
will not be found unu&s;eful, he exhorts the in|genuous
youth not to delight in a multiplicity
of authors; to be &s;elect in his choice, and then
&s;tudiou&s;ly to unite him&s;elf to tho&s;e authors
whom he finds mo&s;t congenial to his own di&s;|po&s;itions.
An excellent rule this! And, to
conclude with a ver&s;e from the Earl of Ro&s;|common&mdash;<Q>To chu&s;e an Author as he would a Friend.</Q></P>
<P>For the benefit of young Authors, I will add
the advice of a Veteran on Publication&mdash;</P>
<P>Menage ob&s;erves, that the works which are
mo&s;t <HI>generally</HI> liked, give a more exten&s;ive re|putation
than the mo&s;t excellent ones, which
<PB N="238" REF="253">
are only reli&s;hed by a few connoi&s;&s;eurs. The
di&s;hes at a fea&s;t &s;hould rather be &s;ea&s;oned to the
ta&s;te of the invited than to that of the cooks,
however able they may be: for, as Martial
&s;ays&mdash;<Q><L>&mdash; Coenae fercula no&s;trae</L>
<L>Malim Convivis, quam placui&s;&s;e Cocis.</L></Q></P>
<P>To give a work which may be crowned with
the approbation of the public, it mu&s;t be read
<HI>three times:</HI> the fir&s;t, perfectly to under&s;tand
it; the &s;econd, to critici&s;e it; and the third, to

<HEAD>VIRGIL.</HEAD>
<P>VIRGIL has violated the immutable laws
of common &s;en&s;e, which exi&s;t in full force in
all ages, and in all countries, by his ridiculous
Miracles, which are not le&s;s in&s;upportable than
tho&s;e which the ancient Chroniclers relate of
their Saints. Among the&s;e, we may ob&s;erve,
<PB N="239" REF="254">
is that of transforming into the Leaves of a
Tree, of which Polydore is the Root, the Lances
with which Polymne&s;tor had pierced him in
the third book of the Aeneid; in making the
branch of a tree produce a Golden Bough, in
the &s;ixth; and in metamorpho&s;ing into Sea
Nymphs, in the eleventh book, the Ships of
Aeneas, which were &s;et on fire. The lea&s;t ju|dicious
of his admirers would even defend
the&s;e miracles: &s;urely, the&s;e fictions are
not miraculous, but ridiculous, and only &s;erve
to blemi&s;h &s;o beautiful a compo&s;ition!</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o condemn, in Virgil, that cruel
Piety by which he has di&s;tingui&s;hed Aeneas, in
cau&s;ing him to immolate eight per&s;ons on the
funeral-pile of Pallas. The example of Homer,
which he has here followed, cannot excu&s;e a
barbarity which &s;hocks our feelings. This
cruel action was characteri&s;tic of the furious
Achilles in the circum&s;tance of the death of
Patroclus, but &s;hould not have been performed
by the pious Aeneas. Be&s;ides, Virgil, who
<PB N="240" REF="255">
had more judgment than Homer, and who
lived in a more poli&s;hed age, is le&s;s excu&s;eable
in having made his Hero commit &s;o barbarous
an action.</P>
<P>In the fourth book of the Aeneid, we are
compelled to animadvert on another &s;ault,
which pains our &s;en&s;ibility. In that book,
where the Poet expre&s;&s;es &s;o well the madne&s;s
of a de&s;pairing Lover, Aeneas appears by much
too cold; and his excu&s;es are, indeed, not very
ingenious for his de&s;ertion of Dido&mdash;in a word,
not a little unfeeling. To all the reproaches
of the pa&s;&s;ionate and tender Queen he has
only to oppo&s;e the orders of Jupiter, and the
&s;everity of his &s;ate. He cannot doubt of the
extreme violence of her pa&s;&s;ion; and he mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily know to what an exce&s;s a woman
of her fervid &s;pirit, who pretended to be united
to him as his wife, would carry it: yet he <HI>&s;leeps,</HI>
in the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity, in his ve&s;&s;el,
till Mercury awakens him.</P>
<P>Some of his adventures &s;eem copies of each

other. Sinon and Acheminedes pre&s;ent them|&s;elves
to the Trojans on two very different
occa&s;ions, but in nearly a &s;imilar manner.
The one in his &s;econd book, and the other in
the third, &s;ay the &s;ame things. The de&s;crip|tions
of the tempe&s;ts too frequently re&s;emble
each other; and they begin two or three times
by the &s;ame ver&s;es. This beautiful ver&s;e&mdash;<Q>Ob&s;tupui, Steteruntque comae et vox faucibus hae&s;it,</Q>
is too often repeated. There are al&s;o <HI>contra|dictions</HI>;
which, probably, he would have cor|rected,
had he lived.</P>
<P>He relates, in the fifth book, the circum|&s;tances
of the death of Palinurus in one man|ner;
and Palinurus him&s;elf, in the &s;ixth, re|lates
it differently. In one, it is the god of
Sleep, under the figure of Phorbas, who hav|ing
cau&s;ed the pilot to fall a&s;leep, precipitates
him and the rudder into the &s;ea; in the other,
it is a gale of wind that carries them both
<PB N="242" REF="257">
away. In one place, Palinurus is &s;wallowed
up in a profound &s;leep by the &s;ea; in the other,
he is perfectly awake, and has time to reflect
that the &s;hip will now wander without a pilot.</P>
<P>Virgil &s;hould not have cau&s;ed Aeneas to re|turn
from Hell by the gate of <HI>Ivory,</HI> but by
that of <HI>Horn.</HI> By employing here the gate of
Ivory, from whence i&s;&s;ued fables and fictions,
formed at plea&s;ure&mdash;<HI>Sed fal&s;a ad Coelum mittunt
in&s;omnia manes</HI>&mdash;is it not de&s;troying, at a &s;ingle
&s;troke, the whole that he has been recounting in
that incomparable book; and tacitly informing
Augu&s;tus, that all he had imagined mo&s;t flat|tering
for him and his anceftors is nothing but
a mere idle fiction?</P>
<P>In the &s;econd book of the Aeneid, A&s;canius
appears a little child, led by the hand of his
father: he could not have attained to more
than &s;even years. In the third, Andromache,
calling to mind A&s;tyanax her &s;on, and addre&s;|&s;ing
her&s;elf to A&s;canius, &s;ays&mdash;'Were he
<PB N="243" REF="258">
living, he would now, like you, have reached
the age of puberty&mdash;<Q>Et nunc aequali tecum pube&s;ceret oevo.</Q></P>
<P>A&s;canius was not, then, a child, before he
went to Africa? Yet Virgil makes him again
but &s;even years in his fourth book, when Dido
holds Cupid in her lap, who had a&s;&s;umed his
figure: yet, in the <HI>very &s;ame book,</HI> he is repre|&s;ented,
not as a <HI>child,</HI> but as a young and vi|gorous
<HI>man,</HI> in a hunting-match, of which he
gives a de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are very irregular and di&s;&s;imi|lar:
contradictions which are very material,
and which cannot be reconciled. Virgil, on
his death-bed, commanded his friends to burn
his Aeneid. The great Poet was con&s;cious
of it's unfini&s;hed &s;tate. Fortunately for po&s;te|rity,
they did not in this re&s;pect obey the
injunctions of their dying friend. The lo&s;s had,
indeed, been irreparable.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="259">
Let it not be con&s;idered, that I have collected
the&s;e critici&s;ms to dimini&s;h the reputation of Vir|gil.
His laurels are placed for above the reach of
envy. I am no Lauder; no Heron; but it is alone
by an enlightened critici&s;m, and by contemplat|ing
the errors of our Ma&s;ters, that we may
hope, if we but faintly attain to their beauties,
at lea&s;t to e&s;cape from their errors.</P>
<P>We can, however, defend Virgil from a
cen&s;ure which attacks at once the Poet and the
Man. The Cardinal Sirlet, Turnebus, Muret,
Taubman, Julius Scaliger, and others not le&s;s
eminent, are much a&s;toni&s;hed that Virgil, in
his &s;ixth book of the Aeneid, de&s;cribing the
Laurel Grove which he has a&s;&s;igned for the
re&s;idence of the Poets, makes no mention
of Homer. On this they have taxed Virgil
with ingratitude and envy; &s;ince here an oc|ca&s;ion
pre&s;ented it&s;elf &s;o favourably to be&s;tow
a beautiful eulogium on Homer, to whom he
&s;tood &s;o deeply indebted; and they have been
a&s;toni&s;hed why he preferred to do this honour
<PB N="245" REF="260">
to the ancient Mu&s;aeus. But this cen&s;ure is
very unju&s;t, and could only be occa&s;ioned by
not reflecting &s;ufficiently on the order of time.
Let us con&s;ider, that Virgil only follows his
Hero: if he &s;peaks of Mu&s;aeus, it is that he
had no other de&s;ign but to mention tho&s;e
Poets who died before the taking of Troy.
He was too judicious, to cau&s;e Aeneas to relate
that he had &s;een Homer among&s;t the Poets,
who was not born till at lea&s;t one hundred and
&s;ixty years after the de&s;truction of Troy.</P>
<P>Virgil, in the &s;econd book of the Georgics,
has be&s;towed high eulogiums on the fertile
territory of Nole, in Campania: but, the inha|bitants
of this city not chu&s;ing to allow their
waters to run through his lands, he era&s;ed
<HI>Nole,</HI> and put <HI>Ora</HI> in it's place. So dreadful
is the vengeance of a Poet!</P>
<P>The Banquet which Alcinous gives Uly&s;&s;es,
in the Ody&s;&s;ey, is very beautiful, and perfectly
gallant: but it appears there are none but men
pre&s;ent. That with which Dido entertains
<PB N="246" REF="261">
Aeneas is not by any means comparable to it in
fe&s;tal elegance. In one, they &s;ing the adven|tures
of the Gods, and other themes, not le&s;s
agreeable than gallant: in the other, they &s;ing
concerning the &s;tars, and other philo&s;ophical
matters. Let the fe&s;tive &s;plendours of Al|cinous
be removed to the Court of Carthage,
and the fea&s;t of Dido to the Pheacian I&s;land;
and every thing will then be in character.</P>
<P>To this article may be added an account of a
thirteenth book of the Aeneid. A Poet, named
<HI>Maphaeus Vegius Laudanen&s;is</HI>&mdash;&s;o Naud&eacute; writes
it, but I ob&s;erve his Commentator tells us it
&s;hould be <HI>Lauden&s;is</HI>&mdash;was born at Lodi, in the
year 1407. At &s;ixteen years of age, he gave
evident marks of an excellent genius. What
is mo&s;t remarkable of him, is, that he has with
great felicity added a thirteenth book to the
Aeneid. Has this book ever been tran&s;lated
into Engli&s;h ver&s;e?</P>

<HEAD>MILTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is painful to ob&s;erve the acrimony which
the mo&s;t eminent Scholars infu&s;e frequently
in their controver&s;ial writings. The polite|ne&s;s
of the pre&s;ent times has, in &s;ome degree,
&s;oftened the malignity of the Man in the dig|nity
of the Author; though it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed
there are living writers who pride them|&s;elves
on being&mdash;as they expre&s;s it&mdash;of the
Warburtonian School; but who di&s;play the
a&s;perity rather than the erudition of a War|burton.</P>
<P>The celebrated controver&s;y of <HI>Salma&s;ius</HI> and
<HI>Milton</HI>&mdash;the fir&s;t, the advocate of King Charles;
the other, the defender of the People&mdash;was of
that magnitude, that all Europe took a part in
the paper-war of the&s;e two great men. The
an&s;wer of Milton, who perfectly ma&s;&s;acred
Salma&s;ius, is now read but by the few. What|ever
is addre&s;&s;ed to the times, however great
<PB N="248" REF="263">
may be it's merit, is doomed to peri&s;h with
the times; yet, on the&s;e Pages, the Philo&s;o|pher
will not contemplate in vain.</P>
<P>It will form no unintere&s;ting article to ga|ther
a few of the rhetorical <HI>weeds</HI>&mdash;for <HI>flowers</HI>
we cannot well call them&mdash;with which they
mutually pre&s;ented each other. Their rancour
was at lea&s;t equal to their condition, though
they were the two mo&s;t learned Scholars of a
learned Age.</P>
<P>That the deformity of the body is an idea
we attach to the deformity of the mind, the
vulgar mu&s;t acknowledge; but &s;urely it is un|pardonable
in the enlightened Philo&s;opher thus
to compare corporeal matter with intellectual
&s;pirit: yet Milbourne and Dennis&mdash;the la&s;t a
formidable Critic&mdash;have frequently con&s;idered,
that comparing Dryden and Pope to what|ever
the eye turned from with di&s;gu&s;t, was
very good argument to lower their literary
abilities. Salma&s;ius &s;eems al&s;o to have enter|tained
this idea, though his &s;pies in England
<PB N="249" REF="264">
gave him wrong information; or, po&s;&s;ibly, he
only drew the figure of his own di&s;tempered
imagination.</P>
<P>Salma&s;ius &s;ometimes reproaches Milton, as
being but a puny piece of Man; a dwarf de|prived
of the human figure; a being compo&s;|ed
of nothing but &s;kin and bone; a contemp|tible
pedagogue, fit only to flog his boys: and
&s;ometimes elevating the ardour of his mind
into a poetic frenzy, he applies to him the&s;e
words of Virgil&mdash;'<HI>Mon&s;trum horrendum, in|forme,
ingens, cui lumen ademptum.</HI>' Our
great Poet thought this &s;en&s;ele&s;s declamation
merited a &s;erious refutation; perhaps he did
not wi&s;h to appear de&s;picable in the eyes of
the Ladies. If the great John&s;on could ex|pre&s;s
his plea&s;ure at learning that Milton wore
latchets to his &s;hoes, his admirers mu&s;t be in|tere&s;ted
in this de&s;cription of him&s;elf. He &s;ays,
that he does not think any one ever con&s;idered
him as unbeautiful; that his &s;ize rather ap|proached
mediocrity than the diminutive; that he
<PB N="250" REF="265">
&s;till felt the &s;ame courage and the &s;ame &s;trength
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed when young, when, with
his &s;word, he felt no difficulty to combat with
men more robu&s;t than him&s;elf; that his face,
far from being pale, emaciated, and wrinkled,
did him much credit; for though he had pa&s;|&s;ed
his fortieth year, he was in all other re|&s;pects
ten years younger. For all this he cal|led
for te&s;timony on multitudes; who, though
they knew him but by &s;ight, would hold him
ridiculous if he did not reveal the truth.</P>
<P>Morus, in his Epi&s;tle Dedicatory of his
<HI>Clamor Regii Sanguinis,</HI> compares Milton to a
Hangman: his di&s;ordered vi&s;ion to the blind|ne&s;s
of his &s;oul; and vomits forth &s;o much
rancour and venom, that to collect his calum|nies
cea&s;es to become an amu&s;ive employ|ment.</P>
<P>When Salma&s;ius found that his &s;trictures
on the per&s;on of Milton were fal&s;e, and that,
on the contrary, it was uncommonly beautiful,
he then turned his battery again&s;t tho&s;e graces
<PB N="251" REF="266">
with which Nature had &s;o liberally adorned his
adver&s;ary. And it is now that he &s;eems to
have &s;et no re&s;trictions to his pen; but, rag|ing
with the irritation of Milton's &s;ucce&s;s, he
throws out the blacke&s;t calumnies, and the
mo&s;t infamous a&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, when Milton fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed
to an&s;wer Salma&s;ius, he had lo&s;t the u&s;e
of one of his eyes; and his phy&s;icians declar|ed,
that if he applied him&s;elf to the contro|ver&s;y,
the other would likewi&s;e clo&s;e for ever!
His patrioti&s;m was not to be baffled but with
life it&s;elf. Unhappily, the prediction of his
phy&s;icians took place! Thus a learned man,
in the occupations of &s;tudy, falls blind; a
circum&s;tance which even now agonizes the
heart of Sen&s;ibility. Salma&s;ius con&s;iders it as
one from which he may draw cau&s;tic ridicule,
and &s;atiric &s;everity.</P>
<P>Salma&s;ius glories that Milton lo&s;t his health
and his eyes in an&s;wering his apology for
King Charles! He does not now reproach him
<PB N="252" REF="267">
with natural deformities; but he malignantly
&s;ympathizes with him, that he now no more is
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that beauty which rendered
him &s;o amiable during his re&s;idence in <HI>Italy.</HI>
He &s;peaks more plainly in a following page;
and, in a word, would blacken the au&s;tere
virtue of Milton with a crime too infamous to
name.</P>
<P>Impartiality of Critici&s;m obliges us to con|fe&s;s,
that Milton was not de&s;titute of rancour.
And, when it was told him that his adver&s;ary
boa&s;ted he had occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of his eyes,
he an&s;wered, with the ferocity of the irritated
Puritan&mdash;'<HI>And I &s;hall co&s;t him his life!</HI>' A
prediction which was &s;oon after verified: for
Chri&s;tina, Queen of Sweden, withdrew her
patronage from Salma&s;ius, and &s;ided with
Milton. The univer&s;al neglect the proud Scho|lar
felt, in con&s;equence, ha&s;tened his death.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of his expul&s;ion from Cambridge
was not forgotten&mdash;nor forgotten to be aggra|vated.
Milton denies this, and relates it in a
<PB N="253" REF="268">
manner honourable to him&s;elf. Salma&s;ius a&s;|&s;ures
his reader, that tho&s;e who well knew
Milton affirm, that he was incapable of Latin
compo&s;ition; but&mdash;in his manner of raillery&mdash;he confe&s;&s;es Milton to be an extraordinary Poet;
and this he maintains by pointing out how fre|quently
he violates, in his Latin ver&s;es, the
laws of quantity. He adds, that the Author
might have &s;pared him&s;elf the pains of indi|cating
his Age; for, without this aid, his
reader mu&s;t have been convinced that they
were the compo&s;itions of the raw Scholar. To
clo&s;e the virulence of his invectives, he tells
us, that Milton's book is written by a French
&s;choolma&s;ter in London, and that he only lent
his name.</P>
<P>What Patin writes in his Letters, in the
&s;ame times, will &s;hew what lame reports the
enemies of Milton helped about. He writes&mdash;'Mon&s;ieur de la Mothe le Vaier informs me,
that the book of Milton again&s;t the King of
England has been burnt by the common
<PB N="254" REF="269">
hangman&mdash;in Paris: that Milton is in pri&s;on;
and, it is to be hoped, will be hung. Some
&s;ay that Milton wrote this Book in Engli&s;h;
and that a Peter de Moulin, who has put it in|to
&s;uch fine Latin, is in danger, for his pains,
of being burnt.' This is in the u&s;ual &s;tyle of
Patin's corre&s;pondence; &s;ome truth, with much
fiction. Moulin was a Confe&s;&s;or of the Royal
party; and was, on the contrary, a favourite
with our &s;econd Charles; and who, having
written again&s;t the Rebels, was one of the few
who&s;e fidelity he rewarded.</P>
<P>It is raking in offals to tran&s;cribe from the
infamous <HI>Lauder.</HI> His virulence, however,
cannot now irritate; it may amu&s;e. He &s;eems
to have poached in Salma&s;ius for Epithets.
His Pamphlets, with the common lyes of the
day, have met the common fate. The pre&s;ent
paragraph is an odd mixture of pedantry, of
vile compo&s;ition, and viler abu&s;e.</P>
<P>' Milton, whom the pre&s;ent generation of
Writers, if they do not on &s;ome occa&s;ions
<PB N="255" REF="270">
<HI>exeem</HI> from &s;ome human frailties and imper|fections,
have yet in the main con&s;pired to
daub with the <HI>untempered mortar</HI> of <HI>unbound|ed</HI>
prai&s;e. By repre&s;enting him as all perfect,
all excellent, without the lea&s;t mixture of alloy,
was rather <HI>a devil</HI> incarnate: an abandoned
<HI>Mon&s;ter</HI> of mankind, of in&s;atiable <HI>avarice,</HI> un|bounded
<HI>ambition,</HI> implacable <HI>malice,</HI> unparal|leled
<HI>impudence,</HI> and &s;hocking <HI>impiety.</HI>" Such
is the declamation which <HI>Lauder,</HI> in the pre|&s;ent
day, had the audacity to acknowledge as
his own compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We will clo&s;e this Article with Bayle's Re|view
of Milton's Controver&s;ial Latin Writings,
for of no others he pretended to judge.
'Milton is very expert in the Latin language.
No one can deny that his &s;tyle is flowing,
animated, and flowery; and that he has de|fended
the people adroitly and ingeniou&s;ly.
But, without entering too deeply into this &s;ub|ject,
it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that his manner is
exceptionable; it is not &s;ufficiently &s;erious for
<PB N="256" REF="271">
the importance of his &s;ubject. We &s;ee him
at every moment&mdash;I do not &s;ay pouring forth
&s;harp railleries again&s;t Mr. Salma&s;ius; that
would not injure his Work, but gain the
laughers on his &s;ide&mdash;attempting to be far|cical,
and to play off the buffoon. This cen|&s;ure
particularly extends to his two an&s;wers of
Mr. Morus. They are replete with outrage|ous
je&s;ts. The character of the Author here
appears without a ma&s;k; he is one of tho&s;e &s;a|tiric
geniu&s;es, who, indeed, are too fond of
collecting all the di&s;advantageous reports of
others, and of having written, by the enemies
of another, all the calumnies they know; but
who feel a greater gratification to in&s;ert tho&s;e
calumnies in the fir&s;t libel they publi&s;h again&s;t
any one.'</P>
<P>I hope this heavy charge laid to our great
Poet is not ju&s;t. He felt great provocations
from Salma&s;ius and Morus; and he was deeply
concerned in one of the greate&s;t political re|volutions.
Surely, the &s;ublime conceptions of
<PB N="257" REF="272">
Milton could not de&s;cend to collect the tattle
of Scandal. To do this, one mu&s;t have a mind
as little, and a heart as rancorous, as &s;ome of
our modern ver&s;ificators.</P>

<P>IT is a melancholy contemplation, to reflect on
the &s;trange trials to which, in the remoter
ages, tho&s;e &s;u&s;pected of guilt were put. The
Ordeal con&s;i&s;ted of various kinds: walking
blindfold amid&s;t heated plough-&s;hares; pa&s;&s;ing
through two fires; holding in the hand a red|hot
bar; and plunging the hand into boiling
water. Challenging the accu&s;er to &s;ingle com|bat,
when frequently the &s;toute&s;t champion
<PB N="260" REF="275">
was allowed to &s;upply their place; the &s;wal|lowing
a mor&s;el of con&s;ecrated bread; the
&s;inking or &s;wimming in a river for witchcraft;
and various others. Though &s;ometimes the&s;e
might be eluded by the artifice of the prie&s;t,
what numbers of innocent victims have been
&s;acrificed to &s;uch barbarous &s;uper&s;titions!</P>
<P>In the twelfth century, they were very com|mon.
Hildebert, Bi&s;hop of Mans, being ac|cu&s;ed
of high-trea&s;on by our William Rufus,
was preparing to undergo one of the&s;e trials;
when Ives, Bi&s;hop of Chartres, convinced him
that they were again&s;t the canons of the con|&s;titutions
of the church.</P>
<P>An Abbot of Saint Aubin of Angers, who
lived in 1066, having refu&s;ed to pre&s;ent a hor&s;e
to the Vi&s;count of Touars, which the Vi&s;|count
claimed in right of his lord&s;hip, when|ever
an Abbot fir&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
&s;aid abbey; the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic offered to ju&s;tify
him&s;elf by the trial of the ordeal, or by duel,
for which he propo&s;ed to furni&s;h a man.
<PB N="261" REF="276">
The Vi&s;count, at fir&s;t, agreed to the duel; but,
reflecting that the&s;e combats, though &s;anction|ed
by the church, depended wholly on the &s;kill
or vigour of the adver&s;ary, and could there|fore
afford no &s;ub&s;tantial proof of the equity
of his claim, he propo&s;ed to compromi&s;e
the matter in a manner which &s;trongly cha|racterizes
the times: he waved his claim, on
condition that the Abbot &s;hould not forget to
mention, in his prayers, him&s;elf, his wife, and
his brothers! As the <HI>ori&s;ons</HI> appeared to the
Abbot, in compari&s;on with the <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> of little

the trial by immer&s;ion in cold water.</P>

they were declared guilty. This mode of trial
was improved, by adding to the <HI>bread</HI> a &s;lice

It does not always happen in the pre|&s;ence

<HEAD>SINGULARITIES OBSERVED BY VARIOUS NA|TIONS
IN THEIR REPASTS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE collected from a very curious book,
entitled&mdash;'<HI>L'E&s;prit des U&s;ages et des Coutumes,</HI>'
the greater part of the pre&s;ent article.</P>
<P>The Maldivian I&s;landers eat alone. They
retire into the mo&s;t hidden parts of their hou&s;es;
and they draw down the cloths that &s;erve as
blinds to their windows, that they may eat
unob&s;erved. This cu&s;tom probably ari&s;es&mdash;re|marks
our philo&s;ophic Author&mdash;from the Sa|vage,
in the early periods of &s;ociety, conceal|ing
him&s;elf to eat: he fears that another, with
as &s;harp an appetite, but more &s;trong than
him&s;elf, &s;hould come and ravi&s;h his meal from
<PB N="265" REF="280">
him. Be&s;ides, the ideas of Witchcraft are wide|ly
&s;pread among Barbarians; and they are not
a little fearful that &s;ome incantation may be
thrown among&s;t their victuals.</P>
<P>In noticing the &s;olitary meal of the Maldi|vian
I&s;lander, another rea&s;on may be alledged
for this mi&s;anthropical repa&s;t. They never will
eat with any one who is inferior to them in
birth, in riches, or dignity; and, as it is a
difficult matter to &s;ettle this equality, they are
condemned to lead this un&s;ociable life.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the I&s;landers of the Phi|lippines
are remarkably &s;ociable. Whenever
one of them finds him&s;elf without a compa|nion
to partake of his meal, he runs till he
meets with one; and, we are a&s;&s;ured, that
however keen his appetite may be, he ventures
not to &s;atisfy it without a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Savages, (&s;ays Montaigne) when they eat,
'<HI>S'e&s;&s;uyent les doigts oux cui&s;&s;es, &agrave; la bour&s;e des
g&eacute;nitoires, et &agrave; la plante des pieds.</HI>' It is impo&s;|&s;ible
to tran&s;late this pa&s;&s;age without offending
<PB N="266" REF="281">
feminine delicacy; nor can we forbear exulting
in the poli&s;hed convenience of napkins!</P>
<P>The tables of the rich Chine&s;e &s;hine with a
beautiful varni&s;h, and are covered with &s;ilk
carpets very elegantly worked. They do not
make u&s;e of plates, knives, or forks: every
gue&s;t has two little ivory or ebony &s;ticks, which
he handles very adroitly.</P>
<P>The Otaheiteans, who are lovers of &s;ociety,
and very gentle in their manners, feed &s;epa|rate
from each other. At the hour of repa&s;t,
the members of each family divide; two bro|thers,
two &s;i&s;ters, and even hu&s;band and wife,
father and mother, have each their re&s;pective
ba&s;ket. They place them&s;elves at the di&s;tance
of two or three yards from each other; they
turn their backs, and take their meal in pro|found
&s;ilence.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of drinking, at different hours
from tho&s;e a&s;&s;igned for eating, is to be met
with among&s;t many &s;avage nations. It was
originally begun from nece&s;&s;ity. It became an
<PB N="267" REF="282">
habit, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted even when the fountain
was near to them. ''A people tran&s;planted,'
ob&s;erves our ingenious Philo&s;opher, 'pre&s;erve,
in another climate, modes of living which re|late
to tho&s;e from whence they originally
came. It is thus the Indians of Brazil &s;cru|pulou&s;ly
ab&s;tain from eating when they drink,
and from drinking when they eat.'</P>
<P>When neither decency or politene&s;s are
known, the man who invites his friends to a
repa&s;t, is greatly embarra&s;&s;ed to te&s;tify his
e&s;teem for his gue&s;ts, and to pre&s;ent them with
&s;ome amu&s;ement; for the &s;avage gue&s;t impo&s;es
on him this obligation. Among&s;t the greater
part of the American Indians the ho&s;t is con|tinually
on the watch to &s;olicit them to eat;
but touches nothing him&s;elf. In New France,
he wearies him&s;elf with &s;inging, to divert the
company while they eat.</P>
<P>When civilization advances, we wi&s;h to &s;hew
our confidence to our friends: we treat them as
relations; and it is &s;aid that, in China, the
<PB N="268" REF="283">
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to give a mark of his po|litene&s;s,
ab&s;ents him&s;elf while his gue&s;ts regale
them&s;elves at his table in undi&s;turbed revelry.</P>
<P>The demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip, in a rude
&s;tate, have a &s;avage and gro&s;s character, which
it is not a little curious to ob&s;erve. The Tartars
pull a man by the ear, to pre&s;s him to drink;
and they continue tormenting him till he opens
his mouth. It is then they clap their hands,
and dance before him.</P>
<P>No cu&s;toms &s;eem more ridiculous than tho&s;e
practi&s;ed by a Kamt&s;chadale, when he wi&s;hes
to make another his friend. He fir&s;t invites
him to eat. The ho&s;t and his gue&s;t &s;trip them|&s;elves
in a cabin, which is heated to an uncom|mon
degree. While the gue&s;t devours the food
with which they &s;erve him, the other con|tinually
&s;tirs the fire. The &s;tranger mu&s;t bear
the exce&s;s of the heat as well as of the repa&s;t.
He vomits ten times before he will yield; but,
at length, obliged to acknowledge him&s;elf
overcome, he begins to compound matters.
<PB N="269" REF="284">
He purcha&s;es a moment's re&s;pite by a pre&s;ent
of cloaths or dogs; for his ho&s;t threatens to
heat the cabin, and to oblige him to eat till he
dies. The &s;tranger has the right of retaliation
allowed to him: he treats in the &s;ame manner,
and exacts the &s;ame pre&s;ents. Should his ho&s;t
not accept the invitation of his gue&s;t, whom he
has &s;o hand&s;omely regaled, he would come
and inhabit his cabin till he had obtained from
him the pre&s;ents he had in &s;o &s;ingular a manner
given to him.</P>
<P>For this extravagant cu&s;tom a curious rea&s;on
has been alledged. It is meant to put the per|&s;on
to a trial who&s;e friend&s;hip is &s;ought. The
Kamt&s;chadale, who is at the expence of the
fires and the repa&s;t, is de&s;irous to know if the
&s;tranger has the &s;trength to &s;upport pain with
him, and if he is generous enough to &s;hare
with him &s;ome part of his property. While
the gue&s;t is employed on his meal, he continues
heating the cabin to an in&s;upportable degree;
and, for a la&s;t proof of the &s;tranger's con&s;tancy
<PB N="270" REF="285">
and attachment, he exacts more cloaths and
more dogs. The ho&s;t pa&s;&s;es through the &s;ame
ceremonies in the cabin of the &s;tranger; and
he &s;hews, in his turn, with what degree of
fortitude he can defend his friend. It is thus
the mo&s;t &s;ingular cu&s;toms would appear &s;imple,
if it were po&s;&s;ible for the Philo&s;opher to con|template
them on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>As a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of their e&s;teem, the
Negroes of Ardra drink out of one cup at the
&s;ame time. The King of Loango eats in one
hou&s;e, and drinks in another. A Kamt&s;cha|dale
kneels before his gue&s;t; he cuts an enor|mous
&s;lice from a &s;ea-calf; he crams it entire
into the mouth of his friend, furiou&s;ly crying
out&mdash;'<HI>Tana!</HI>&mdash;There!' and, cutting away
what hangs about his lips, &s;natches and &s;wal|lows
it with avidity.</P>
<P>A barbarous magnificence attended the fea&s;ts
of the ancient Monarchs of France. We are
informed that, after their coronation or con&s;e|cration,

and pardons to tho&s;e who &s;hould arm again&s;t
the&s;e <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as he &s;tiled the&s;e unfor|tunate

was con&s;trained to &s;ubmit. The inhabitants
were pa&s;&s;ed on the edge of the &s;word, without
di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex. It was then he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed

for having con&s;idered that, though

unfriendly to the intere&s;ts of Rome. Dominic
did &s;o much by his cares and continued per&s;e|cutions,
that he firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed it at Tou|lou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was as late as the year 1484 that it became
known in Spain. It was al&s;o to a Dominican,
John de Torquemada, that the Court of Rome
owed this obligation. As he was the Confe&s;&s;or

promi&s;e that, if ever &s;he a&s;cended the throne,
&s;he would u&s;e every means to extirpate Here&s;y
and Heretics. Ferdinand had conquered Gre|nada,
and had chaced from the Spani&s;h realms
multitudes of unfortunate Moors. A few had
remained; who, with the Jews, he obliged to
become Chri&s;tians: they at lea&s;t a&s;&s;umed the

diffidence to her Confe&s;&s;or; and, at

<HEAD>FASHIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of many, probably of mo&s;t Fa|&s;hions,
was in the endeavour to conceal &s;ome
deformity of the inventor. Thus Charles the
Seventh, of France, introduced Long Coats, to
hide his ill-made legs. Shoes, with very long
points, full two feet in length, were invented
by Henry Plantaganet, Duke of Anjou, to
conceal a very large excre&s;cence which he had
upon one of his feet.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="306">
Sometimes, Fa&s;hions are quite rever&s;ed in
one age from tho&s;e of another. Thus Bags,
when fir&s;t in fa&s;hion in France, were only wore
<HI>en di&s;habille.</HI> In vi&s;its of ceremony, the hair
was tied in a ribband, and floated over the
&s;houlders&mdash;all which is exactly contrary to our
pre&s;ent fa&s;hion. Queen I&s;abella, of Bavaria,
as remarkable for her gallantry as the fairne&s;s
of her complexion, introduced a fa&s;hion of
leaving the &s;houlders and part of the neck un|covered.</P>
<P>In England, about the reign of Henry the
Fourth, they wore long-pointed Shoes, to &s;uch
an immoderate length, that they could not
walk till they were fa&s;tened to their knees
with chains. Luxury improving on this ridi|culous
mode, it was the cu&s;tom of an Engli&s;h
Beau of the fourteenth century to have the&s;e
chains of gold or &s;ilver. A very accurate ac|count
of one of this de&s;cription may be found
in Henry's Hi&s;tory of Great Britain, in his
chapter on Manners, &amp;c. Vol. IV. The
<PB N="292" REF="307">
Ladies of that period were not le&s;s fanta&s;tical

<P>To this article, as it may probably arre&s;t
the volatile eye of our fair Reader, we add
what may &s;erve as a hint for the heightening
of her charms. Tacitus remarks of <HI>Poppea,</HI>
the Queen of Nero, that &s;he concealed <HI>a part</HI>

<HEAD>THE POULIATS, AND THE POULICHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent article, which I have drawn
from Abb&eacute; Raynal, pre&s;ents two pictures of
<PB N="294" REF="309">
the deba&s;ement of the human race, which, per|haps,
Hi&s;tory has never paralleled.</P>
<P>' There is a tribe among&s;t the Indians which
is the refu&s;e of the re&s;t. The members of it
are employed in the meane&s;t offices of &s;ociety.
They bury the dead, carry away dirt, and live
upon the fle&s;h of animals that <HI>die natural
deaths.</HI> They are prohibited from entering in|to
the <HI>temples</HI> and public <HI>markets</HI>; neither are
they allowed the u&s;e of <HI>the wells,</HI> that are com|mon
to all their inhabitants. Their dwellings
are at the <HI>extremity</HI> of the towns, or con&s;i&s;t of
<HI>&s;olitary</HI> cottages in the country; and they are
even <HI>forbidden to appear in the &s;treets</HI> where
the Bramins re&s;ide. As all other Indians, they
may employ them&s;elves in the labours of agri|culture:
but only for the benefit of <HI>the other
tribes</HI>; for they are not permitted to have lands
of their own, not even upon lea&s;e. Such is
the degree of horror they excite, that if, by
chance, they were <HI>to touch any one</HI> not belong|ing
to their tribe, they would be deprived, with
<PB N="295" REF="310">
impunity, of <HI>a life</HI> reckoned too abject to de|&s;erve
the protection of the laws. Mo&s;t of them
are employed in the culture of rice. Near the
fields where they carry on this work, there is
a kind of hut, into which they retire when they
hear <HI>a cry,</HI> which always comes from a di|&s;tance,
to give them notice of &s;ome order from
the per&s;on on whom they depend; to which
they an&s;wer, not coming out of their retreat.
They take the &s;ame precautions whenever
they are warned, by a confu&s;ed kind of noi&s;e,
of the approach of <HI>any man</HI> whatever. If they
have not time to hide them&s;elves, they fall
<HI>pro&s;trate</HI> on the ground, with their faces down|wards,
with all the marks of humiliation
which the &s;en&s;e of their di&s;grace can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>' Whenever the harve&s;ts do not an&s;wer to the
avidity of an oppre&s;&s;ive ma&s;ter, he &s;ometimes
cruelly <HI>&s;ets fire</HI> to the huts of the&s;e unhappy
labourers; and if they <HI>attempt</HI> to e&s;cape the
flames, <HI>he fires upon them</HI> without mercy! The
condition of the&s;e wretched people is horrible
<PB N="296" REF="311">
in every re&s;pect, even in <HI>the manner</HI> in which
they are forced to provide for their mo&s;t <HI>urgent
wants.</HI> In the du&s;k of the evening, they come
out from their retreats in bands; they direct
their &s;teps towards the market, at a certain di|&s;tance
from which they begin <HI>to bellow!</HI> The
merchants approach; and they a&s;k for what
they want. They are &s;upplied, and the provi|&s;ions
are laid on the very &s;pot where the mo|ney
de&s;tined for the payment of them has been
previou&s;ly depo&s;ited. When <HI>the purcha&s;ers</HI>
can be a&s;&s;ured that they &s;hall not be &s;een by
any one, they come out from behind the hedge
where they had <HI>concealed</HI> them&s;elves, and carry
away, with <HI>precipitation,</HI> what they have ac|quired
in &s;o &s;ingular a manner.'</P>
<P>After contemplating this di&s;honourable pic|ture
of Man, (a degeneracy in Human Nature
which probably the reader could hardly &s;u&s;pect)
he may deepen the philo&s;ophic reverie by what
the Abb&eacute; gives us in continuation.</P>
<P>' Yet this very tribe of <HI>Pouliats</HI> have <HI>an in|ferior</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="312">
one among them&s;elves, called <HI>Pouliches.</HI>
The&s;e la&s;t are forbidden the u&s;e of fire; they
are not permitted to build huts, but are re|duced
to the nece&s;&s;ity of living in a kind of <HI>ne&s;t
upon the trees,</HI> or in the fore&s;ts. When pre&s;|&s;ed
with hunger, they <HI>howl</HI> like wild bea&s;ts, to
excite compa&s;&s;ion. The mo&s;t charitable then
depo&s;it &s;ome rice, or other food, at the foot of
a tree, and <HI>retire</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to give
the fami&s;hed wretch an opportunity of taking
it without meeting with his benefactor, who
would think him&s;elf polluted by coming near
him.'</P>
<P>To clear up this curious information, which
&s;tretches to the utmo&s;t the belief of the reader,
the Abb&eacute; pre&s;ents us with an excellent philo|&s;ophical
argument. 'This extreme di&s;grace,' he
&s;ays, 'into which a con&s;iderable part of a nu|merous
nation is plunged, has always appear|ed
an inexplicable circum&s;tance. Men of the
utmo&s;t &s;agacity have never been able to con|ceive,
how a people, humane and &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="298" REF="313">
could have brought them&s;elves to reduce their
own brethren to &s;o abject a &s;tate. To &s;olve
this difficulty, let us be permitted to hazard a
conjecture. In our half barbarous govern|ments,
dreadful torments, or an ignominious
death, are allotted to tho&s;e criminals who have
di&s;turbed, in a greater or le&s;s degree, the peace
of &s;ociety. May we not therefore rea&s;onably
&s;uppo&s;e that, in the &s;oft climate of India, a
more moderate &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lature may have
been &s;atisfied with <HI>excluding</HI> from their tribes
all kinds of malefactors? This puni&s;hment
mu&s;t appear to them &s;ufficient to put a &s;top to
the commi&s;&s;ions of &s;uch crimes; and it was
certainly the be&s;t adapted to a country where
the effu&s;ion of blood was always forbidden
by religious as well as moral principles. It
would certainly have been a very proper cir|cum&s;tance,
if <HI>the children</HI> had not inherited the
infamy of their parents: but there were un|furmountable
prejudices which militated again&s;t
this rein&s;tatement; a family never being re|ceived
<PB N="299" REF="314">
again into a tribe after it had been once
expelled from it.'</P>
<P>The &s;olution of the Abb&eacute; is ingenious and
probable: but the Mo&s;aic threat of vengeance
extending to the third and fourth generation, is
uncongenial to the mild &s;pirit of humane philo|&s;ophy.
Yet is this threat on record in tho&s;e Com|mandments
which are &s;aid to have been written
by the finger of God him&s;elf. Surely this can|not
accord with the unwearied benevolence of
a paternal Deity! Let us rather acknowledge,
with a &s;igh, that there are multitudes of the
human race who really believe them&s;elves to
be the property of a &s;mall number of men who
oppre&s;s them. The image of the Creator is &s;o

Modern Hi&s;tory has recorded many &s;uch in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>In Candide, or the Optimi&s;t, the reader will
find an admirable &s;troke of Voltaire's. Eight
travellers meet in an ob&s;cure inn, and &s;ome of

Europe, who had been deprived of their
crowns.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="327">
What adds to this exqui&s;ite &s;atire, is, that
the Eight Monarchs are not of the fictitious
Maje&s;ties of the Poetic Brain; Imperial Sha|dows,
like tho&s;e that appeared to Macbeth;
but living Monarchs, who were wandering at
that moment about the world.</P>
<P>Theodore, King of Cor&s;ica, is not yet for|gotten
by many. Smollet, in his Ferdinand
Count Fathom, has given us &s;ome curious
anecdotes, which paint very forcibly the &s;ingu|lar
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that Monarch.</P>
<P>Here is another to be added to this li&s;t. In
the year 1595, died at Paris, Antonio, King of
Portugal. His body is interred at the Cor|deliers,
and his heart depo&s;ited at the Ave
Maria. Nothing on earth was capable of
obliging this Prince to renounce his crown.
He pa&s;&s;ed over to England, and came to
France, where he re&s;ided; and died, in great
poverty, at the age of &s;ixty-four years. This
dethroned Monarch was happy in one thing,
which is indeed rare. In all his mi&s;eries,
<PB N="313" REF="328">
he had a &s;ervant, who proved a tender and
faithful friend, and who only de&s;ired to parti|cipate
in his misfortunes, and to &s;often his

he only wi&s;hed to be buried at the feet of
his dear ma&s;ter. This hero in loyalty, to whom
the ancient Romans had rai&s;ed altars, was Don
Diego Bothei, one of the greate&s;t Lords of the

as the voice of Adulation has di&s;tingui&s;hed
her.</P>
<P>' Elizabeth, Queen of England, pa&s;&s;ion|ately
admired hand&s;ome and well-made men;
and he was already far advanced in her favour
who approached her with beauty and with
grace. On the contrary, &s;he had &s;o uncon|querable
an aver&s;ion for ugly and ill-made men,
who had been treated unfortunately by Nature,
that &s;he could not endure their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>' When &s;he i&s;&s;ued from her palace, her guards
were careful to di&s;per&s;e from before her eyes
hideous and deformed people, the lame, the
hunch-backed, &amp;c. in a word, all tho&s;e who&s;e
appearance might &s;hock her delicate &s;en&s;a|tions.</P>
<P>' There is this &s;ingular and admirable in the
conduct of Elizabeth, that &s;he made her plea|&s;ures
&s;ub&s;ervient to her politics, and &s;he main|tained
her affairs by what in general occa&s;ions

the ruin of Princes. So &s;ecret were her amours,
that, even to the pre&s;ent day, their my&s;teries
cannot be penetrated; but the utility &s;he drew
from them is public, and always operated for
the good of her people. Her lovers were her
Mini&s;ters, and her Mini&s;ters were her lovers.
Love commanded, Love was obeyed; and the

dry; but not without a particular ob&s;ervation of

<P>OF the&s;e men, who are &s;ingular in&s;tances of
a patriarchal longevity of life, the reader will
not be di&s;plea&s;ed to attend to the following
well authenticated notices concerning them.</P>
<P>Thomas Parr was born in the la&s;t year of
King Edward the Fourth, anno 1483. He
married his fir&s;t wife, Jane, at eighty years of
age; and, in above thirty years, &s;he brought
him but two children, the elde&s;t of which did
not live above three years. He married his
&s;econd wife, Catherine, when he was an hun|dred
and twenty years of age, by whom he
had one child. He lived till he had attained
to &s;omething above one hundred and fifty years
of age. Thomas, Earl of Arundel, cau&s;ed
him to be brought to We&s;tmin&s;ter about two
months before his death: there he pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="319" REF="336">
mo&s;t of his time in &s;leep; and an ocular wit|ne&s;s
has thus de&s;cribed him&mdash;<Q><L>From head to heel, his body had, all over,</L>
<L>A quick&s;et, thick&s;et, nat'ral, hairy cover.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed this removal, by taking him
from his native air, and the di&s;turbance of
much company, ha&s;tened his death. He died
there, November 15, 1634, in the ninth year
of King Charles the Fir&s;t, and was buried in
the Abbey.</P>
<P>Henry Jenkins lived till he was an hundred
and &s;ixty-nine years of age. A remarkable
circum&s;tance di&s;covered the age of this man.
Being &s;worn a witne&s;s in a cau&s;e of an hundred
and twenty years, the judge could not help
reproving him, till he &s;aid he was <HI>then</HI> butler
to the Lord Conyers; and, at length, his name
was found in &s;ome old regi&s;ter of the Lord
Conyers's menial &s;ervants. Dr. Tancred Ro|bin&s;on,
who &s;ent the account of this man to
the Royal Society, adds farther, that Henry
<PB N="320" REF="337">
Jenkins, coming into his &s;i&s;ter's kitchen to beg
an alms, he a&s;ked him, how old he was? Af|ter
a little pau&s;ing, he &s;aid, he was about one
hundred and &s;ixty-two or three. The Doctor
a&s;ked him, what Kings he remembered? He
&s;aid, 'Henry the Eighth.' What public things
he could longe&s;t remember? He &s;aid, 'The
fight at Flowden Field.' Whether the King
was there? He &s;aid, 'No, he was in France,
and the Earl of Surrey was General.' How
old he was then? He &s;aid, 'About twelve
years old.' The Doctor in&s;pected an old Chro|nicle
that was in the hou&s;e, and found that the
Battle of Flowden Field was one hundred and
fifty-two years before; that the Earl he named
was General; and that Henry the Eighth was
then at Tournay.</P>
<P>Jenkins was a poor man, and could neither
write nor read. He died December the 8th,
1670.</P>

<HEAD>FEUDAL TYRANNY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Feudal government introduced a &s;pecies
of &s;ervitude which till that time was unknown,
and which was called the Servitude of the
Land. The Bondmen, or Villains, did not
re&s;ide in the hou&s;e of the Lord: but they en|tirely
depended on his caprice; and he &s;old
them, as he did the animals, with the field
where they lived, and which they cultivated.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive with what in&s;olence
the petty Lords of tho&s;e times tyrannized over
their Villains: they not only oppre&s;&s;ed their
&s;laves with unremitted labour, in&s;tigated by a
vile cupidity; but their whim and caprice led
them to inflict mi&s;eries without even any mo|tive
of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In Scotland, they had a right to enjoy the
fir&s;t-fruits of all the Maidens; and Malcolm
the Third did not aboli&s;h this &s;hameful right
<PB N="322" REF="339">
but by ordering that they might be redeemed
by a quit-rent.</P>
<P>Others, to pre&s;erve this privilege when they
could not enjoy it in all it's extent, thru&s;t their
leg, booted, into the bed of the new-married
couple. Others have compelled their &s;ubjects
to pa&s;s the fir&s;t night at the top of a tree, and
there to con&s;ummate the marriage; to pa&s;s the
bridal hours in a river; to be bound naked to
a cart, and to trace &s;ome furrows as they were
dragged; or to leap, with their feet tied, over
the horns of &s;tags.</P>
<P>Sometimes their caprice commanded the
bridegroom to appear in drawers at their ca&s;tle,
and plunge into a ditch of mud; and &s;ome|times
they were compelled to beat the waters
of the ponds, to hinder the frogs from di&s;|turbing
the Lord!</P>
<P>There was a time when the German Lords
reckoned, among&s;t their privileges, that of
robbing on the highways of their territory!</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind the reader of the
<PB N="323" REF="340">
&s;hameful behaviour of Geoffrey, Lord of Co|ventry,
who compelled his wife to ride naked,
on a white pad, through the &s;treets of the town;
that, by this mode, he might re&s;tore to the in|habitants
tho&s;e privileges of which his wan|tonne&s;s
had deprived them.</P>
<P>When the Abbot of Figeac makes his entry
into that town, the Lord of Montbrun, dre&s;&s;ed
in a Harlequin's coat, and one of his legs
naked, is compelled, by an ancient cu&s;tom, to
conduct him to the door of his abbey, by lead|ing
his hor&s;e by the bridle.</P>
<P>The Feudal Barons frequently a&s;&s;ociated to
&s;hare among&s;t them tho&s;e children of their Vil|lains
who appeared to be the mo&s;t healthy and
&s;erviceable, or who were remarkable for their
talents; and, not infrequently, &s;old them in
their markets as they did their bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Feudal &s;ervitude is not, even in the pre|&s;ent
enlightened times, entirely aboli&s;hed in Po|land,
in Germany, and in Ru&s;&s;ia. In tho&s;e coun|tries,
the Bondmen are &s;till entirely dependent
<PB N="324" REF="341">
on the caprice of their ma&s;ters. The Pea&s;ants
of Hungary, or Bohemia, frequently revolt,
and attempt to &s;hake off the pre&s;&s;ure of Feudal
tyranny; and it is ardently to be wi&s;hed that
their wretched &s;ervitude &s;hould in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
be &s;oftened.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce thirty years pa&s;t, when a Lord or
Prince of the Northern Countries, pa&s;&s;ing
through one of his villages, ob&s;erved a little
a&s;&s;embly of Pea&s;ants and their families amu&s;ing
them&s;elves with dancing. He commands his
dome&s;tics to part the men from the women,
and confine them in the hou&s;es. He or|ders
that the coats of the women may be
drawn up above their heads, and tied with their
garters. He then permits the men to be libe|rated,
and inflicts a &s;evere ca&s;tigation on all
tho&s;e who did not recognize their wives in that
&s;tate!</P>
<P>Ab&s;olute dominion hardens the human heart;
and Nobles, accu&s;tomed to command their
Bondmen, will treat their dome&s;tics as &s;laves.
<PB N="325" REF="342">
Tho&s;e of Siberia puni&s;h theirs by an abundant

the three mo&s;t important topics which a wri|ter
of the pre&s;ent day can di&s;cu&s;s&mdash;Suicide,
Gaming, and Duelling. He has collected a va|riety
of in&s;tances of this de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion
being prevalent in all nations; and I &s;hall ju&s;t
notice tho&s;e which appear mo&s;t &s;ingular.</P>
<P><HI>Dice,</HI> and that little pugnacious animal the
<HI>Cock,</HI> are the chief in&s;truments employed by
the numerous nations of the Ea&s;t, to agitate
their minds and ruin their fortunes; to which
the Chine&s;e&mdash;who are de&s;perate game&s;ters&mdash;add
the u&s;e of <HI>Cards.</HI> When all other property
is played away, the A&s;iatic gambler &s;cruples
not to &s;take his <HI>wife,</HI> or his <HI>child,</HI> on the ca&s;t of
a die, or courage and &s;trength of a martial
bird. If &s;till un&s;ucce&s;sful, the la&s;t venture he
&s;takes is, <HI>him&s;elf!</HI></P>
<P>In the I&s;land of Ceylon, <HI>cock-fighting</HI> is car|ried
<PB N="328" REF="345">
to a great height. The Sumatrans are ad|dicted
to the u&s;e of dice. A &s;trong &s;pirit of
play characterizes a Malayan. After having
re&s;igned every thing to the good fortune of the
winner, he is reduced to a horrid &s;tate of de&s;|peration;
he then loo&s;ens a certain lock of
hair, which indicates war and de&s;truction to all
the raving game&s;ter meets. He intoxicates
him&s;elf with opium; and, working him&s;elf up
into a fit of phrenzy, he bites and kills every
one who comes in his way. But, as &s;oon as
ever this lock is &s;een flowing, it is <HI>lawful</HI> to
fire at the per&s;on, and to de&s;troy him as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible. I think it is this which our &s;ailors
call, 'To run a muck.' Thus Dryden writes&mdash;<Q><L>Frontle&s;s, and &s;atire-proof, he &s;cours the &s;treets,</L>
<L>And <HI>runs</HI> an Indian <HI>Muck</HI> at all he meets.</L></Q> Thus al&s;o Pope&mdash;<Q><L>Satire's my weapon, but I'm too di&s;creet</L>
<L>To <HI>run a Muck,</HI> and tilt at all I meet.</L></Q></P>
<P>John&s;on could not di&s;cover the derivation of
<PB N="329" REF="346">
the word <HI>Muck.</HI> I think I have heard that
it refers to their employing, on the&s;e fatal oc|ca&s;ions,
a <HI>muck,</HI> or lance; but my recollection
is, probably, imperfect.</P>
<P>To di&s;charge their gambling debts, the
Siame&s;e &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their families,
and, at length, them&s;elves. The Chine&s;e play
<HI>night</HI> and <HI>day,</HI> till they have lo&s;t all they are
worth; and then they u&s;ually go and hang
them&s;elves. Such is the propen&s;ity of the
Japane&s;e for high play, that they were com|pelled
to make a law, that 'Whoever ventures
his money at play, &s;hall be put to death.' In
the newly-di&s;covered i&s;lands of the Pacific
Ocean, they venture even their hatchets, which
they hold as invaluable acqui&s;itions, on running
matches. 'We &s;aw a man,' as Cooke writes
in his la&s;t voyage, 'beating his brea&s;t, and
tearing his hair, in the violence of rage, for
having lo&s;t three hatchets at one of the&s;e races,
and which he had purcha&s;ed with nearly half
his property.'</P>

own dome&s;tic annals, the dreadful prevalence
of this unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion. Affection has felt
the keene&s;t lacerations, and Genius been irre|coverably

<HEAD>THE ATHENIANS.</HEAD>
<P>MARVILLE has given this plea&s;ing ac|count
of the Athenians&mdash;</P>
<P>' The Greeks were &s;o poli&s;hed a nation, that
they treated others as rude and barbarous;
but, of all the Greeks, the Athenians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="331" REF="348">
a more refined delicacy in the politer Arts, and
an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te for Eloquence. The excel|lent
Orators who aro&s;e among&s;t them had fa|miliarized
them with the mo&s;t perfect beauties
of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>' Pericles, who&s;e eloquence they compared to
lightnings and thunders, had &s;o accu&s;tomed
their minds to &s;uffer nothing but what was
pure, elegant, and fini&s;hed, that tho&s;e who had
to &s;peak in public, looked upon the lowe&s;t of
the people as &s;o many cen&s;urers of what they
were going to &s;ay. But, if the genius of this
people had become &s;o delicate by the attic elo|quence
of their Orators, the native haughtine&s;s
of the Greeks was much increa&s;ed by their
&s;ervile adulation; &s;o that it required a wonder|ful
dexterity to &s;tretch the empire of Per|&s;ua&s;ion
over men who always would be treated
like ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>' The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ingular law of
<HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> which was occa&s;ioned by the tyranny
of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, cau&s;ed a double increa&s;e of pride
<PB N="332" REF="349">
to this people, who were already &s;o pre&s;umptu|ous.
Thus runs the &s;entence of this famous
law&mdash;"Let no one of us excel the others; and,
if there &s;hould be one found of this de&s;cription,
let him go and excel el&s;ewhere." By this law,
tho&s;e who&s;e great merit and high reputation
gave umbrage to their citizens, were bani&s;hed
for ten years.</P>
<P>' It was, in it's commencement, ob&s;erved
with &s;o much rigour, that Ari&s;tides, who was
&s;urnamed <HI>The Ju&s;t,</HI> and who had performed &s;o
many great actions for the glory of his country,
was condemned to bani&s;hment: and, although
this &s;everity had greatly abated of it's rigour
under Alcibiades, and that it was aboli&s;hed in
the cour&s;e of time; there remained, in the
manners and minds of the Athenians, a
great jealou&s;y of tho&s;e who had di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by &s;ome extraordinary merit; and
a rigorous &s;everity towards their Orators, which
con&s;trained them to be very circum&s;pect. The
rules they had impo&s;ed on them went &s;o far
<PB N="333" REF="350">
as to prohibit their di&s;playing ornaments too
elaborate, which might di&s;gui&s;e their real
&s;entiments&mdash;images and motions, capable of
affecting and &s;oftening their auditors&mdash;for they
regarded the fir&s;t as fal&s;e lights, that might
mi&s;lead their rea&s;on; and the latter, as at|tempts
to encroach on their liberty, by &s;waying
their pa&s;&s;ions. It is to this we mu&s;t attribute
that coldne&s;s and au&s;terity which pervade the
di&s;cour&s;es of the&s;e Orators, and which rather
proceeded from the re&s;traint laid on them than
from the qualities of their genius.</P>
<P>' Be&s;ides that the Athenians were haughty,
jealous of their power, and au&s;tere towards
their Orators, they had an impatience, and a
volatility of di&s;po&s;ition, which occa&s;ioned
them frequently to pa&s;s from one extreme to
another, by &s;udden and unexpected re&s;olutions,
and often broke all the mea&s;ures and &s;chemes
of tho&s;e who attempted to gain them over to
their &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="351">
' A hand rai&s;ed, or a loud cry from &s;ome
factious per&s;on, in an a&s;&s;embly, was often the
&s;ignal for an advice that was to be di&s;clo&s;ed, or
of a coun&s;el which was to be taken: and as it
happens, that tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t in&s;olent
when they command, are the mo&s;t &s;upple when
they obey; the Athenians, who had been &s;o
haughty during the pro&s;perity of their Re|public,
were the mo&s;t abject &s;laves to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors
of Alexander; and afterwards to the
Romans, when they became their ma&s;ters.
This feeble people had, in the bottom of their
hearts, a fund of meanne&s;s and of timidity,
which made them con&s;train their Orators to
conform them&s;elves to their manners and their
genius. To &s;ucceed with them, it became
nece&s;&s;ary to appear to re&s;pect them, whil&s;t
they taught them to fear; to flatter and to
cen&s;ure them, at the &s;ame time&mdash;a policy
which Demo&s;thenes, who well knew this
people, with great &s;ucce&s;s &s;o &s;kilfully ap|plied.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="352">
' This people has, however, produced great
men, and in great numbers; but they had &s;o
&s;eldom a &s;hare in the public re&s;olutions, that
their merit, of which they have left &s;o many
illu&s;trious te&s;timonies, cannot, however, make
a general rule to judge of the character of this
people.'</P>
<P>To this ingenious di&s;crimination of the cha|racter
of the Athenians, I cannot forbear tran&s;|cribing
an animated de&s;cription of their luxu|ries,
carried to &s;uch an exce&s;s of refinement,
and opulent elegance, that tho&s;e who are fond
of cen&s;uring our modern di&s;&s;ipations, may be
reminded, that we have never yet approached
tho&s;e of the Grecians or the Romans. It is
extracted from Dr. Gillies's Hi&s;tory of Greece.</P>
<P>' In&s;tead of the bread, herbs, and &s;imple
fare, recommended by the Laws of Solon,
the Athenians, &s;oon after the 80th Olympiad,
availed them&s;elves of their exten&s;ive com|merce,
to import the delicacies of di&s;tant coun|tries,
which were prepared by all the refine|ments
<PB N="336" REF="353">
of cookery. The wines of Cyprus were
cooled with &s;now in &s;ummer; in winter, the
mo&s;t delightful flowers adorned the tables and
per&s;ons of the wealthy Athenians. Nor was it
&s;ufficient to be crowned with ro&s;es, unle&s;s
they were likewi&s;e anointed with the mo&s;t pre|cious
perfumes. Para&s;ites, dancers, and buf|foons,
were an u&s;ual appendage of every en|tertainment.
Among the weaker &s;ex, the pa&s;|&s;ion
for delicate birds, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their
voice or plumage, was carried to &s;uch exce&s;s,
as merited the name of madne&s;s. The bodies
of &s;uch youths as were not addicted to hunt|ing
and hor&s;es, which began to be a prevail|ing
ta&s;te, were corrupted by a commerce of
barlots, who had reduced their profe&s;&s;ion into
<HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> while their minds were &s;till more pol|luted
by the licentious philo&s;ophy of the So|phi&s;ts.
It is unnece&s;&s;ary to croud the picture;
vices and extravagance took root in Athens in
an admini&s;tration the mo&s;t &s;plendid and pro&s;pe|rous.'</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="354">
Perhaps, this la&s;t ob&s;ervation is cleared up
by the remarks of Marville; for it appears
that, although at the helm of admini&s;tration
&s;at &s;uch illu&s;trious characters, they had little
or no &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, &s;ince the
haughtine&s;s and volatility of the Athenians
were &s;uch, that they would not even bear the
reprimands of their Orators.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that even the Me|chanics
in Athens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a cla&s;&s;ic ta&s;te, and a
nicene&s;s of ear, which could only be the ef|fect
of a general diffu&s;ion of national ele|gance.
For an anecdote of their <HI>Attici&s;m,</HI> take
this.</P>
<P>Philip of Macedon, in the pre&s;ent age,
would have merited the title of a Cla&s;&s;ical
Scholar. I have already given the noble let|ter
he wrote to Ari&s;totle on the birth of his
&s;on. The pre&s;ent anecdote will prove, that
he mu&s;t have been&mdash;like the late Frederick&mdash;not
le&s;s partial to the contemplative Minerva,
than to the armed Pallas. To give a proof of
<PB N="338" REF="355">
his genero&s;ity, he made a pre&s;ent to the van|qui&s;hed
Athenians of five thou&s;and mea&s;ures
of wheat; but this was not to be given by him
without accompanying it by an oration. While
he was holding his di&s;cour&s;e to the people, he
committed a &s;oleci&s;m in language, which the
attic ear of an Athenian immediately catching,
he boldly reproved him. 'For this,' the Cla&s;|&s;ic
Monarch continued, 'I grant you five thou|&s;and
more.'</P>

<HEAD>POPE SIXTUS THE FIFTH.</HEAD>
<P>A SINGULAR revolution of fortune hap|pened
to Pope Sixtus the Fifth. He was ori|ginally
a &s;wine-herd. When he fir&s;t came to
Rome, he was con&s;trained to beg alms. Hav|ing
collected a little &s;ilver, he one day &s;tood
deliberating with him&s;elf, whether he &s;hould
employ it in the purcha&s;e of a loaf, which the
keenne&s;s of his appetite reminded him would
<PB N="339" REF="356">
prove a very agreeable acqui&s;ition; or, in a
pair of &s;hoes, which his ten toes terribly com|plained
of wanting. In this conflict of irre|&s;olution,
his face betrayed the anxiety of his
mind. A trade&s;man, who had for &s;ome time
ob&s;erved his embarra&s;&s;ment, a&s;ked him the oc|ca&s;ion
of it. He told him frankly the cau&s;e;
but he did it in &s;o facetious a manner, that the
trade&s;man re&s;olved to fini&s;h his perplexity by
inviting him to a good dinner. When Sixtus
became Pope, he did not forget to return the
dinner to the benevolent trade&s;man.</P>
<P>To give an in&s;tance of his abilities as a Po|litician.
When he fir&s;t a&s;pired in his mind to
the Popedom, while he was yet a Cardinal, he
counterfeited illne&s;s and old age for &s;everal
<HI>years.</HI> During the Conclave, which was a&s;|&s;embled
to create a Pope, he continually lean|ed
on his crutch; and very frequently inter|rupted
the &s;age deliberations of the Conclave by
a hollow cough, and violent &s;pitting. This
&s;cheme took &s;o well, that the Cardinals fell
<PB N="340" REF="357">
into the trap; and every one thinking that, by
electing Sixtus, he might him&s;elf &s;tand a
chance of being in a &s;hort time elected, he
was cho&s;en unanimou&s;ly. Soon after the elec|tion
was concluded, the new Pope perform|ed
a <HI>Miracle</HI>: his legs became vigorous; his
body, that had been before curbed, became
firm and erect; his cough was di&s;&s;ipated; and
he &s;hewed, in a &s;hort time, of what he was
capable.</P>

<HEAD>THE SENATE OF JESUITS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is to be found, in a book intitled&mdash;'Inter&ecirc;ts
et Maximes des Princes et des Etats
Souverains, Par M. Le Duc de Rohan; Co|logne,
1666'&mdash;an anecdote concerning the
Je&s;uits; &s;o much the more curious, as neither
Puffendorf or Vertot have noticed it in their
Hi&s;tories, though it's authority cannot be
higher. It was probably unknown to them.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="358">
When Sigi&s;mond, King of Sweden, was
elected King of Poland, he made a treaty with
the States of Sweden, by which he obliged
him&s;elf to pa&s;s every fifth year in that king|dom.
In the cour&s;e of time, being con&s;train|ed,
by the wars he had with the Ottoman Court,
with Mu&s;covy, and Tartary, to remain in Po|land,
to animate, by his pre&s;ence, the wars he
held with &s;uch powerful enemies; he failed,
during fifteen years, of accompli&s;hing his pro|mi&s;e.
To remedy this, in &s;ome &s;hape, by the
advice of the Ju&s;uits, who had gained the a&s;cen|dant
over him, he created a Senate, which was
to re&s;ide at Stockholm, compo&s;ed of forty cho|&s;en
Je&s;uits, to decide on every affair of &s;tate.
He publi&s;hed a declaration in their favour; and
pre&s;ented them with letters-patent, by which
he clothed them with the Royal authority.</P>
<P>While this &s;enate of Je&s;uits was at Dant|zic,
waiting for a fair wind to &s;et &s;ail for Stock|holm,
he publi&s;hed an edict, that they &s;hould
receive them as his own Royal per&s;on. A
<PB N="342" REF="359">
public Council was immediately held. Charles,
the uncle of Sigi&s;mond, the Prelates, and the
Lords, re&s;olved to prepare for them a &s;plendid
and magnificent entry.</P>
<P>But, in a private Council, they came to very
contrary re&s;olutions: for the Prince &s;aid, he
could not bear that a Senate of Prie&s;ts &s;hould
command, in preference to all the honours and
authority of &s;o many Princes and Lords, na|tives
of the country. All the others agreed
with him in rejecting this holy Senate. It was
then the Archbi&s;hop ro&s;e, and &s;aid&mdash;'Since
Sigi&s;mond has di&s;dained to be our King, &s;o al&s;o
we mu&s;t not acknowledge him as &s;uch; and
from this moment we &s;hould no more con&s;ider
our&s;elves as his &s;ubjects. His authority is <HI>in
&s;u&s;pen&s;o,</HI> becau&s;e he has be&s;towed it on the
Je&s;uits who form this Senate. The People
have not yet acknowledged them. In this in|terval
of re&s;ignation on the one &s;ide, and a&s;|&s;umption
of the other, I di&s;pen&s;e you all of the
fidelity the King may claim from you as his
<PB N="343" REF="360">
Swedi&s;h &s;ubjects.' When he had &s;aid this,
the Prince of Bithynia, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to
Prince Charles, uncle of the King, &s;aid&mdash;'I
own no other King than you; and I believe
you are now obliged to receive us as your af|fectionate
&s;ubjects, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to cha&s;e the&s;e
vermin from the &s;tate.' All the others joined
him, and acknowledged Charles as their lawful
Monarch.</P>
<P>Having re&s;olved to keep their declaration for
&s;ome time &s;ecret, they deliberated in what
manner they were to receive and to precede
this Senate in their entry into the harbour,
who were on board a great galleon, which they
had cau&s;ed to ca&s;t anchor two leagues from
Stockholm, that they might enter more mag|nificently
in the night, when the fire-works
they had prepared would appear to the greate&s;t
advantage. About the time of their reception,
Prince Charles, accompanied by twenty-five
or thirty ve&s;&s;els, appeared before the Senate.
Wheeling about, and forming a caracol of
<PB N="344" REF="361">
&s;hips, they di&s;charged a volley, and emptied
all their cannon on the galleon of this Senate,
which had it's &s;ides pierced through with the
balls. The galleon was immediately filled
with water, and &s;unk, without one of the un|fortunate
Je&s;uits being a&s;&s;i&s;ted; on the con|trary,
they cried to them, that this was the
time to perform &s;ome miracle, &s;uch as they
were accu&s;tomed to do in India and Japan;
and, if they cho&s;e, they could walk on the
waters!</P>
<P>The report of the cannon, and the &s;moke
which the powder occa&s;ioned, prevented either
the cries or the &s;ubmer&s;ion of the Holy Fathers
from being ob&s;erved: and, as if they were con|ducting
the Senate to the town, Charles en|tered
triumphantly; went into the church,
where they &s;ung <HI>Te Deum</HI>; and, to conclude
the night, he partook of the entertainment
which had been prepared for the ill-fated
Senate.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="362">
The Je&s;uits of the city of Stockholm hav|ing
come, about midnight, to pay their re&s;pects
to the Fathers of the Senate, perceived their
lo&s;s: they directly po&s;ted up <HI>placards</HI> of ex|communication
again&s;t Charles and his adhe|rents,
who had cau&s;ed the Senate to peri&s;h.
They &s;olicited the people to rebel; but they
were &s;oon cha&s;ed from the city, and Charles
made a public profe&s;&s;ion of Lutherani&s;m.</P>
<P>Sigi&s;mond, King of Poland, began a war

an exce&s;s of patrioti&s;m. This pa&s;&s;ion cannot

the merits of a rival nation. To give an in|&s;tance

<P>A French writer has wilfully mi&s;repre&s;ented
the famous anecdote recorded of our Canute,
and endeavoured to convey an idea that we
have ever been a nation of haughty barbarians.
It cannot be ignorance, but wilful mi&s;repre|&s;entation.
The anecdote was never related
but in one manner, and which reflects great
honour on our ancient Monarch. The author
attempts to prove, that the Engli&s;h nation have
been overbearing from the remote&s;t times; and
this he in&s;tances by giving the anecdote of
Canute in this &s;en&s;ele&s;s narration&mdash;</P>
<P>' Canute, King of England, imitating his
predece&s;&s;ors, who called them&s;elves Lords and
Sovereigns of the &s;ea, re&s;olved to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this title &s;olemnly, that, in future times, it
&s;hould not be conte&s;ted. Per&s;uaded that he
could not render this act more authentic than
<PB N="348" REF="365">
by obliging the &s;ea it&s;elf to come and pay him
homage, as to it's Sovereign, about the time of
the tide, he rai&s;ed his throne by the &s;ea-&s;ide;
and there, apparelled in his royal robes, he held
this language to the &s;ea, when it rolled to|wards
him&mdash;"Know, that thou art &s;ubjected
to me: the earth on which I &s;it is mine; and
that, till now, none has ever dared to revolt
from my will. I command thee, then, that
thou remain where thou art, without daring
to approach thy Lord, and &s;oil his robes!"
Scarce had he concluded this &s;peech, when a
wave overturned his throne; and, having

<HEAD>THE ITALIANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of the Italians, even &s;o late
as in the la&s;t century, pre&s;ents a melancholy
contemplation to the Philo&s;opher. How are
we to account for a whole nation being infected
with &s;ome of the darke&s;t pa&s;&s;ions that &s;tain the
human &s;oul? Athei&s;m and Debauchery per|vaded
every rank; and the hand of the Italian
continually gra&s;ped the dagger and the drug.
What yet heightens the enormity of the&s;e
crimes, is the 'immortal hatred'&mdash;to make u&s;e
of a poetical expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;which characterized
this Nation of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Naud&eacute;, who draws
his remarks from per&s;onal ob&s;ervation, with
one or two anecdotes, will inform the reader
that the&s;e cen&s;ures are not unju&s;t.</P>
<P>' Italy is crouded with tho&s;e kinds of men
<PB N="350" REF="367">
who penetrate as far into Nature as their abi|lities
permit them; and, having done this,
will believe nothing more. To trace God, in
the di&s;order in which the world is now, we
mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s mode&s;ty and humility. Italy
abounds with Libertines and Athei&s;ts; yet the
number of their writers, who have written on
the Immortality of the Soul, is incredible.
But I am apt to think that tho&s;e very writers
believe no more than the re&s;t: for I hold this
maxim certain, that <HI>the doubt</HI> in which they
are in is one of the fir&s;t cau&s;es that obliges
them to write; and add, al&s;o, that all their
writings are &s;o feeble, that no one can
&s;trengthen, by their &s;entiments, his faith.
Thus, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing, they make a
reader perfectly &s;ceptical.</P>
<P>'Italy is a country, at the &s;ame time, full
of Impo&s;tures and Super&s;titions: &s;ome do not
believe enough, and others believe every thing.
Every day, without truth, and without rea&s;on,
miracles take place. I remember that a cer|tain
<PB N="351" REF="368">
poor man was nearly drowned, and was
drawn out of the water almo&s;t dead. He re|covered;
and his recovery was firmly believed to
be, becau&s;e he happened to have in his chaplet
a medal of Saint Philip of Neri. I did not &s;ee
any thing miraculous in this, I &s;aid; and that
it certainly was not always a miracle when a
man e&s;caped from being drowned: nor did I
believe that Saint Philip thought one moment
concerning the fate of this man.</P>
<P>' It is but three months &s;ince, that the church
of this new &s;aint fell in at Trepani, when more
than a dozen of the congregation, who were
invoking his favours, got wounded and killed.
It was then, rather, that the &s;aint &s;hould have
&s;hewn his miraculous powers, and have faved
tho&s;e good Chri&s;tians who were &s;upplicating
God and his &s;aint&s;hip. Had this been the ca&s;e,
it would have turned out an excellent Miracle,
and, what few Miracles are accompanied by,
have had a con&s;iderable number of witne&s;&s;es to
verify it.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="369">
' The Italians are an agreeable people
enough; but, too frequently, they are found
vindictive and treacherous. Revenge and trea|chery
are the great &s;ins of the Italians and the
Ea&s;terns; and they poi&s;on to the very mice in
their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>' It is a maxim received into the politics of
this country, however it may be inimical to
the laws of Chri&s;tianity, that it is be&s;t to de|fend
and to avenge our&s;elves before wor&s;e hap|pens.
As they have great &s;en&s;e, they will never
offend you; but they will never pardon you,
if you offend them; and they will pur&s;ue their
revenge, after an interval of fifty years has
elap&s;ed &s;ince the offence had been fir&s;t given.
They have this Proverb much in e&s;teem&mdash;'<HI>Chi
offende, non perdona mai.</HI>'</P>
<P>De&s;cartes, in one of his Letters, writes thus&mdash;'Be not &s;o de&s;irous to live under Italian &s;kies;

<P>The following anecdotes of Italian revenge
are of good authority. An Italian feigned to
be reconciled with one who had offended him.
One evening, when they walked out together
in a retired &s;pot, the Italian &s;eized him by the
back; and, drawing a dagger, threatened to
&s;tab him if he did not abjure, and cur&s;e the
Creator. The other, in vain, entreated that he
might not be obliged to commit what he felt a
horror in doing; but, to &s;ave his life, at length
he complied. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, having now com|pleated
his wi&s;h, plunged the poignard in his
bo&s;om; and exultingly exclaimed, that he had
revenged him&s;elf in the mo&s;t dreadful manner
po&s;&s;ible; for he had cau&s;ed the body and the &s;oul
of his enemy to peri&s;h at a &s;ingle &s;troke!</P>
<P>One Giu&s;eppe Bertoldo, after an ab&s;ence
of ten years, hearo that a per&s;on who had
&s;erved him an ill turn, re&s;ided in flouri&s;hing
circum&s;tances at India. He embarks directly;
<PB N="354" REF="371">
he arrives; he follows him clo&s;ely for two
years; and, at length, having found him one
day alone, and unarmed, in a &s;olitary &s;pot, he
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates him.</P>
<P>There is a narration, written in Italian, in a
manu&s;cript in the French King's Library,
tacked to the end of a Volume intitled&mdash;'<HI>Le

<P>Francis of Medicis, after the death of his

Venetian, named Bianca Capella, whom he
married. This lady, who pa&s;&s;ionately loved

<HEAD>CRITICAL HISTORY OF POVERTY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Morin has formed a little Hi&s;tory of
Poverty, which I &s;hall endeavour to abridge.</P>
<P>It is difficult preci&s;ely to fix on the epoch
of Poverty, or to mark with accuracy the mo|ment
<PB N="356" REF="373">
of it's birth. Chronologi&s;ts are &s;ilent;
and tho&s;e who have formed genealogies of the
Gods, have not noticed this Deity's, though
&s;he has been admitted as &s;uch in the Pagan
heaven, and has had temples and altars on
earth. The Fabuli&s;ts have plea&s;ingly narrated
of her, that at the fea&s;t which Jupiter gave on
the birth of Venus, &s;he mode&s;tly &s;tood at the
gate of the palace, to gather the remains of the
cele&s;tial banquet; when &s;he ob&s;erved Plutus,
the God of Riches, inebriated, not with wine,
but with nectar, roll out of the heavenly re&s;i|dence;
and, pa&s;&s;ing into the Olympian gar|dens,
he threw him&s;elf on a vernal bank. She
&s;eized this opportunity to become familiar
with the God. The frolick&s;ome Deity ho|noured
her with his care&s;&s;es; and, from this
amour &s;prung the God of Love, who re&s;em|bles
his father in jollity and mirth, and his
mother in his nudity. This fabulous narration
is taken from the divine Plato. Let us now turn
to it's hi&s;toric extraction.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="374">
Poverty, though of remote antiquity, did
not exi&s;t from the earlie&s;t times. In the fir&s;t
Age, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet of the Golden,
it certainly was unknown. In the terre&s;trial
Paradi&s;e it never entered. This Age, how|ever,
had but the duration of a flower: when
it fini&s;hed, Poverty began to appear. The
ance&s;tors of the human race, if they did not
meet her face to face, knew her in a partial de|gree.
She mu&s;t have made a rapid progre&s;s
at the time of Cain; for Jo&s;ephus informs us,
he &s;coured the country with a banditti. Pro|ceeding
from this ob&s;cure period, it is certain
&s;he was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Patriarchal
age. It is then we hear of Merchants, who
publicly practi&s;ed the commerce of vending
&s;laves, which indicates the utmo&s;t degree of
Poverty. She is di&s;tinctly marked by Job:
this holy man prote&s;ts, that he had nothing to
reproach him&s;elf with re&s;pecting the Poor, for
he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>As we advance in the Scriptures, we ob|&s;erve
<PB N="358" REF="375">
the Legi&s;lators paid great attentions to
their relief. Mo&s;es, by his wi&s;e precautions,
endeavoured to &s;often the rigours of this un|happy
&s;tate. The divi&s;ion of lands, by tribes
and families; the &s;eptennial jubilees; the re|gulation
to be&s;tow, at the harve&s;t-time, a certain
portion of all the fruits of the earth for tho&s;e
families who were in want; and the obliga|tion
of his moral law, to love one's neighbour
as one's &s;elf; were &s;o many mounds erected
again&s;t the inundations of Poverty. It was
thus that the Jews, under their Ari&s;tocratic
government, had few or no Mendicants.&mdash;Their Kings were unju&s;t; and, rapaciou&s;ly &s;eiz|ing
on inheritances which were not their right,
increa&s;ed the numbers of the poor. From the
reign of David, there were oppre&s;&s;ive gover|nors,
who devoured the people as their bread. It
was &s;till wor&s;e under the foreign powers of
Babylon, of Per&s;ia, and the Roman Em|perors.
Such were the extortions of their Pub|licans,
and the avarice of their Governors, that
<PB N="359" REF="376">
the number of Mendicants was dreadfully
augmented; and, it was probably for that
rea&s;on that the opulent families con&s;ecrated
a tenth part of their property for their &s;uc|cours,
as appears in the time of the Evange|li&s;ts.
In the preceding ages, no more was
given&mdash;as their Ca&s;ui&s;ts a&s;&s;ure us&mdash;than the
fortieth, or thirtieth part; a cu&s;tom which this
unfortunate nation to the pre&s;ent hour pre&s;erve
and look on it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty; &s;o
much &s;o, that if there are no poor of their na|tion
where they re&s;ide, they &s;end it to the mo&s;t
di&s;tant parts. The Jewi&s;h merchants always
make this charity a regular charge in their
tran&s;actions with each other; and, at the clo&s;e
of the year, render an account to the poor of
their nation.</P>
<P>By the example of Mo&s;es, the ancient Legi|&s;lators
were taught to pay a &s;imilar attention
to their poor. Like him, they publi&s;hed laws
re&s;pecting the divi&s;ion of lands; and many
ordinances were made for the benefit of tho&s;e
<PB N="360" REF="377">
whom fires, inundations, wars, or bad harve&s;ts,
had reduced to want. Convinced that <HI>idlene&s;s</HI>
more inevitably introduced poverty than any
other cau&s;e, they puni&s;hed it rigorou&s;ly. The
Egyptians made it criminal; and no vaga|bonds
or medicants were &s;uffered, under any
pretence whatever. Tho&s;e who were con|victed
of &s;lothfulne&s;s, and &s;till refu&s;ed to labour
for the public, when labours were offered to
them, were puni&s;hed with death. It was the
Egyptian ta&s;k-ma&s;ters who ob&s;erved that the
I&s;raelites were an idle nation, and obliged them
to furni&s;h bricks for the erection of tho&s;e fa|mous
pyramids, which are the works of men
who otherwi&s;e had remained vagabonds and
mendicants.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit in&s;pired Greece. Lycurgus
would not have in his republic either <HI>poor</HI> or
<HI>rich:</HI> they lived and laboured in common.
As, in the pre&s;ent times, every family has it's
&s;tores and cellars; &s;o they had public ones, and
di&s;tributed the provi&s;ions according to the ages
<PB N="361" REF="378">
and con&s;titutions of the people. If the &s;ame
regulation was not preci&s;ely ob&s;erved by the
Athenians, the Corinthians, and the other
people of Greece, the &s;ame maxim exi&s;ted in
full force again&s;t idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>According to the laws of Draco, Solon, &amp;c.
a conviction of wilful poverty was puni&s;hed
with the lo&s;s of life. Plato, more gentle in
his manners, would have them only bani&s;hed.
He calls them enemies of the &s;tate; and pro|nounces,
as a maxim, that where there are
great numbers of mendicants, fatal revolutions
will happen; for, as the&s;e people have nothing
to lo&s;e, they &s;eize and plan opportunities to di&s;|turb
the public repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The ancient Romans, who&s;e univer&s;al object
was the public pro&s;perity, were not indebted to
Greece on this head. One of the principal
occupations of their Cen&s;ors was to keep a
watch on the vagabonds. Tho&s;e who were
condemned as incorrigible &s;luggards, were &s;ent
to the mines, or made to labour on the public
<PB N="362" REF="379">
edifices. The Romans of tho&s;e times, unlike
the pre&s;ent race, did not con&s;ider the <HI>far niento</HI>
as a plea&s;ing occupation: they were convinced,
that their liberalities were ill-placed in be&s;tow|ing
them on &s;uch men. The little republics
of the <HI>Bees</HI> and the <HI>Ants</HI> were often held out
as an example; and the la&s;t, particularly,
where Virgil &s;ays, that they have elected over|&s;eers,
who correct the &s;luggards&mdash;<Q><L>&mdash;Pars agmina cogunt</L>
<L>Ca&s;tigant que moras.</L><BIBL>VIRGIL.</BIBL></Q>

And, if we may tru&s;t the narratives of our tra|vellers,
the <HI>Beavers</HI> pur&s;ue this regulation
more rigorou&s;ly and exact than even the&s;e in|du&s;trious
&s;ocieties. But their rigour, although
but animals, is not &s;o barbarous as that of the
ancient Germans; who, Tacitus informs us,
plunged the idlers and vagabonds in the
thicke&s;t mire of their mar&s;hes, and left them
to peri&s;h by a kind of death that re&s;embled
their inactive di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="380">
Yet, after all, it was not inhumanity that
prompted the ancients thus &s;everely to cha&s;ti&s;e
idlene&s;s: they were induced to it by a &s;trict
equity; and it would be doing them inju&s;tice
to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was thus they treated tho&s;e
<HI>unfortunate poor</HI> who&s;e indigence was occa|&s;ioned
by infirmities, by age, or unfore&s;een
calamities. They, perhaps, exceeded us in
genuine humanity. Every family con&s;tantly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted it's branches, to &s;ave them from being
reduced to beggary; which, to them, appeared
wor&s;e than death. The magi&s;trates protected
tho&s;e who were de&s;titute of friends, or inca|pable
of labour. When Uly&s;&s;es was di&s;gui&s;ed
as a mendicant, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to Eury|machus,
this Prince, ob&s;erving him to be ro|bu&s;t
and healthy, offered to give him employ|ment,
or otherwi&s;e to leave him to his ill for|tune.
When the Roman Emperors, even in
the reigns of Nero and Tiberius, be&s;towed their
large&s;&s;es, the di&s;tributors were ordered to ex|cept
tho&s;e from receiving a &s;hare who&s;e bad
<PB N="364" REF="381">
conduct kept them in mi&s;ery; for that it was
better the lazy &s;hould die with hunger than be
fed in idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>Whether the police of the ancients was more
exact, or whether they were more attentive to
practi&s;e the duties of humanity, or that &s;lavery
&s;erved as an efficacious corrective of idlene&s;s;
it clearly appears how little was the mi&s;ery,
and how few the numbers, of their poor. This
they did, too, without having recour&s;e to ho&s;|pitals.</P>
<P>At the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, when
the Apo&s;tles commanded a community of riches
among their di&s;ciples, the mi&s;eries of the poor
became alleviated in a greater degree. If they
did not ab&s;olutely live together, as we have
&s;een religious orders, yet the rich continually
&s;upplied their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren: but matters
greatly changed under Con&s;tantine. This
Prince, with the be&s;t intentions, publi&s;hed
edicts in favour of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who had
been condemned, in the preceding reigns, to
<PB N="365" REF="382">
&s;lavery, to the mines, the galleys, or pri&s;ons.
The Church felt an inundation of prodigious
crowds of the&s;e unhappy men, who brought
with them urgent wants and corporeal in|firmities.
The Chri&s;tian families formed then
but a few: they could not &s;atisfy the&s;e men.
The magi&s;trates protected them: they built
&s;pacious ho&s;pitals, under different titles, for
the &s;ick, the aged, the invalids, the widows,
and orphans. The Emperors, and the mo&s;t
eminent per&s;onages, were &s;een in the&s;e ho&s;|pitals,
examining the patients. Sometimes
they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the helple&s;s, and &s;ometimes dre&s;&s;ed
the wounded. This did &s;o much honour to the
new religion, that Julian the Apo&s;tate intro|duced
this cu&s;tom among the Pagans. But
the be&s;t things are &s;een continually per|verted.</P>
<P>The&s;e retreats were found not &s;ufficient.
Many &s;laves, proud of the liberty they had
ju&s;t recovered, looked on them as pri&s;ons;
and, under various pretexts, wandered about
<PB N="366" REF="383">
the country. They di&s;played, with art, the
&s;cars of their former wounds, and expo&s;ed the
imprinted marks of their chains. They found
thus a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion in begging, which
had been interdicted by the laws. The pro|fe&s;&s;ion
did not fini&s;h with them: men of an
untoward, turbulent, and licentious di&s;po&s;i|tion,
gladly embraced it. It &s;pread &s;o wide,
that the &s;ucceeding Emperors were obliged to
in&s;titute new laws; and it was permitted to
individuals to &s;eize on the&s;e mendicants for
their &s;laves and perpetual va&s;&s;als: a powerful
pre&s;ervative again&s;t this di&s;order. It is ob|&s;erved
in almo&s;t every part of the world but
ours; and it is thus that nowhere they &s;o
abound with beggars. China pre&s;ents us with
a noble example. No beggars are &s;een loiter|ing
in their country. All the world are occu|pied,
even to the blind and the lame. Tho&s;e
who are incapable of labour, live at the public
expence. What is done <HI>there,</HI> may al&s;o be
performed <HI>here.</HI> Then, in&s;tead of that hide|ous,
<PB N="367" REF="384">
importunate, idle, licentious poverty&mdash;as
pernicious to the police as to morality&mdash;we
&s;hould &s;ee the poverty of the earlier ages hum|ble,
mode&s;t, frugal, robu&s;t, indu&s;trious, and
laborious. Then, indeed, the fable of Plato
might be realized: Poverty may be embraced
by the god of riches; and, if &s;he did not pro|duce
the vuluptuous offspring of Love, &s;he
would become the fertile mother of Agricul|ture,
and the ingenious mother of the fine
Arts, and of all kinds of Manufactures.</P>

<P>I HAVE chiefly collected the pre&s;ent Anec|dotes

<P>It avails little to exclaim again&s;t Slavery; it

and, if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an adequate &s;trength,
he would en&s;lave whatever &s;urrounded him.
Dominion is &s;o flattering to pride, and to idle|ne&s;s,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;acrifice it's enjoy|ments.
Even the Slave him&s;elf requires to be
attended by another Slave: it is thus with the
Negro of Labat; who, &s;ince his &s;tate permits
of none, a&s;&s;umes a de&s;potic authority over his
wife and children.</P>
<P>There are Slaves even with &s;avages; and, if
force cannot e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ervitude, they employ
other means to &s;upply it. The Chief of the
<HI>Natch&egrave;s</HI> of Loui&s;iana di&s;po&s;es at his will of
the property of his &s;ubjects: they dare not
even refu&s;e him their head. He is a perfect
de&s;potic prince. When the pre&s;umptive heir
is born, the people devote to him all the chil|dren
at the brea&s;t, to &s;erve him during his life.
This petit Chief is a very Se&s;o&s;tris; he is treated
in his cabin as the Emperor of China is in his
palace. Indeed, the origin of his power is
great: the <HI>Natch&egrave;s</HI> adore the Sun, and this
<PB N="369" REF="386">
Sovereign has palmed him&s;elf on them for the
Brother of the Sun!</P>
<P>Servitude is &s;ometimes as plea&s;ing to the
&s;lave as it is gratifying to the ma&s;ter; and can
any thing more &s;trongly convince us, that the
greater part of men are unworthy of ta&s;ting
the &s;weets of liberty? It was thus, when the
Monarchs of France were de&s;irous of de&s;poiling
the Barons of the authority they had u&s;urped,
the bondmen, accu&s;tomed to &s;lavery, were &s;low
in claiming their liberty. To effect this, it be|came
nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>compel</HI> them by laws; and
Louis Hutin ordered, that tho&s;e villains, or
bondmen, who would not be enfranchi&s;ed,
&s;hould pay heavy fines.</P>
<P>The origin of Slavery, in &s;ome countries,
ari&s;es from &s;ingular circum&s;tances. If a Tar|tar
met in his way a man, or woman, who
could not &s;hew a pa&s;&s;port from the King, he
would &s;eize on the per&s;on as his right and

<P>Formerly, in Circa&s;&s;ia, when the hu&s;band

the woman to be &s;eized on and &s;old, and gave
another to the hu&s;band; and, on the contrary,
he &s;eized on and &s;old the hu&s;band, if the wife
arrived the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Liberality, and the de&s;ire of obliging&mdash;who
could credit it?&mdash;occa&s;ion the depriving others
of their liberty. An I&s;lander of Mindanao, who
redeems his &s;on from Slavery, makes him his
own &s;lave; and children exerci&s;e the &s;ame be|nevolence
and rigour on their parents.</P>
<P>In Rome, the debtor became the &s;lave of his
creditor; and, when it happened that they could
take nothing from him who had lo&s;t every
thing, they took his liberty. It is even believed,
that the law of the Twelve Tables permitted
them to cut into pieces an in&s;olvent debtor!</P>
<P>It is &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the commerce
and &s;ale of Negroes, that men have committed
the mo&s;t enormous crimes. The Mulattoes
<PB N="371" REF="388">
of Loanda &s;educe the young women wherever
they pa&s;s: they return to them, &s;ome years
afterwards; and, under the pretext of giving
the children a better education, they carry them
off to &s;ell them.</P>
<P>Thus, al&s;o, the women of Benguela, in col|lu&s;ion
with their hu&s;bands, allure other men
to their arms. The hu&s;band falls &s;uddenly on
them, impri&s;ons the unfortunate gallants, and
&s;ells them the fir&s;t opportunity; and he is not
puni&s;hed for the&s;e violences.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Negroes &s;ell their children, their
parents, and their neighbours! They lead to
the country-hou&s;e of the merchant their un&s;u|&s;picious
victims, and there deliver them into
the hands of their purcha&s;er. While they are
loaded with chains, and &s;eparated for ever from
their mo&s;t endearing connections, it is in vain
they rai&s;e loud and melancholy cries: the infa|mous
vender &s;miles, and &s;ays it is only a cunning
trick. Le Maire informs us, that an old Ne|gro
re&s;olved to &s;ell his &s;on: but the &s;on, who
<PB N="372" REF="389">
&s;u&s;pected his de&s;ign, ha&s;tened to the factor;
and, having taken him a&s;ide, &s;old him his
father!</P>
<P>The I&s;landers of Bi&s;&s;agos are pa&s;&s;ionately
fond of &s;pirituous liquors; and, on the arrival
of a ve&s;&s;el, the weake&s;t, without di&s;tinction of
age, friend&s;hip, or relation&s;hip, become the
prey of the &s;tronge&s;t, that they may &s;ell them
to purcha&s;e liquors.</P>
<P>It appears that, in the Ea&s;t, and particularly
at Batavia, the life of a &s;lave entirely depends
on the caprices of his ma&s;ter: the &s;lighte&s;t
fault brings on him the mo&s;t afflicting treat|ment.
They bind him to a gallows; they
flog him unmercifully with &s;plitted canes; his
blood flows in a &s;tream, and his body is co|vered
with wounds: but, fearful that he may
not die in &s;ufficient tortures, they &s;catter abun|dantly
over them &s;alt and pepper. So little
care is paid to the&s;e unfortunate men among&s;t
the Maldivians, that they lie entirely at the
mercy of every one. Tho&s;e who practi&s;e on
<PB N="373" REF="390">
them any ill treatment, receive only half the
puni&s;hment that the laws exact from any one
who had ill-treated a free per&s;on. The &s;lighte&s;t
cha&s;ti&s;ement which is inflicted on them, at
Java, is to carry about their necks a piece of
wood, with a chain, and which they are con|demned
to drag all their lives.</P>
<P>The &s;laves of the kingdom of Angola, and
many other countries of Africa, never addre&s;s
their ma&s;ters but on their knees. They do
not even allow them the honours of decent
burial; they throw their bodies in the woods,
where they become the food of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e on the Gold Coa&s;t e&s;cape, and are
retaken, they lo&s;e an ear for the fir&s;t offence
of this kind: a &s;econd offence is puni&s;hed with
the lo&s;s of the other. At the third, it is al|lowed
their ma&s;ters either to &s;ell them to the
Europeans, or to cut off their heads.</P>
<P>Religious fanatici&s;m increa&s;es the inhumanity
of the pirates of Africa. The Moors and the
Europeans reciprocally dete&s;t each other; and,
<PB N="374" REF="391">
&s;ince they redeem their captives, the Mahome|tans
have become unmerciful, that they may
the more powerfully excite their friends to re|deem
them with heavy ran&s;oms. We mu&s;t
not credit every thing Hi&s;torians record; but
it is certain that the police does not puni&s;h the
ma&s;ter who kills his &s;laves; that religious pre|judices
totally &s;tifle the feelings of humanity;
and that the zealous Mu&s;&s;ulman inflicts con|tinual
tortures on the&s;e unfortunate men, that
they may abjure their religion.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, and the Knights of Malta,
for their repri&s;als, chain to the galley all the
Mahometans they make pri&s;oners; and, it is
thus that the fate of the Chri&s;tian &s;laves on the
Northern Coa&s;t of Africa, is the natural con|&s;equence
of a war which never can termi|nate.</P>
<P>When the NEGROES of the Colonies &s;olely
depend on a brutal ma&s;ter, who can paint the
horrors of their &s;ituation? Without dwelling
on the cruelties which they &s;uffer in Africa,
<PB N="375" REF="392">
before they are &s;old, and during the voyage;
the greater part believe, that, after their em|barkment
from America, the Europeans intend
to ma&s;&s;acre them in the mo&s;t terrible manner
imaginable: to burn, calcine, and pulverize
their bones, to be employed as gunpowder;
and they al&s;o imagine, that the Europeans
manufacture an oil with their fat and marrow.</P>
<P>If they do not fini&s;h their ta&s;k, they are
la&s;hed with rods till they are covered with
blood. Sometimes they pour over their raw
wounds a pound of melted pitch; and &s;ome|times
they heighten their un&s;upportable &s;mart
by &s;cattering over them handfuls of pepper!</P>
<P>The habit of &s;uffering endows them with
an admirable patience. It is thus <HI>Labat</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf on this head. 'They are &s;el|dom
heard to cry out, or to complain. It is
not owing to in&s;en&s;ibility, for their fle&s;h is ex|tremely
delicate, and their feelings irritable.
It proceeds from an uncommon magnanimity
of &s;oul, which &s;ets at defiance pain, grief,
<PB N="376" REF="393">
and death it&s;elf. I have more than once &s;een
&s;ome broken on the wheel, and others torment|ed
by the mo&s;t dreadful machines inventive
cruelty could produce, without their giving
vent to one murmur, or &s;hedding one tear. I
&s;aw a Negro burnt, who was &s;o far from being
affected, that he called for a little lighted to|bacco,
on his way to the place of execution;
and I ob&s;erved him &s;moak with great calmne&s;s,
at the moment his feet were con&s;uming in the
mid&s;t of the flames. There were two Negroes
condemned; the one to the gallows, the other
to be whipped by the hand of the executioner.
The Prie&s;t, in a mi&s;take, confe&s;&s;ed him who
was not to have died. They did not perceive
it, till the moment the executioner was going
to throw him off; they made him de&s;cend; the
other was confe&s;&s;ed; and, although he expect|ed
only to be whipped, he mounted the ladder
with as much indifference as the fir&s;t de&s;cend|ed
from it, and as if the choice of either fate
was alike to him.'</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="394">
How grievous mu&s;t be the unfortunate de|&s;tiny
of tho&s;e Negroes, when they po&s;&s;e&s;s a
&s;oul &s;o great, and &s;entiments &s;o &s;ublime! At|kins,
examining once &s;ome &s;laves, ob&s;erved
one of a noble &s;lature, who appeared to him
not le&s;s vigorous than imperious; he glanced
on his companions, whenever they murmured
or wept, looks of reproach and di&s;dain. He
never turned his eyes on the over&s;eer; and,
if commanded to ri&s;e, or to &s;tretch his
leg, he did not by any means immediately
obey. His exa&s;perated ma&s;ter wearied him|&s;elf
with la&s;hing his naked body with his rod.
He was going to di&s;patch him in his fury, had
it not been ob&s;erved to him, that if he &s;old him,
he might get an uncommon price for a &s;lave of
his appearance. The Negro &s;upported this
per&s;ecution with heroic intrepidity; he pre|&s;erved
a rigid &s;ilence; a tear or two only trick|led
down his cheek; when, as if he blu&s;hed
for his weakne&s;s, he turned a&s;ide to hide them.
'I learnt,' Atkins writes, 'that he was a Chief
<PB N="378" REF="395">
of &s;ome villages who had ju&s;t come from op|po&s;ing
the &s;lave-traffic of the Engli&s;h.' Mr.
Mackenzie, in one of his Novels, has de|&s;cribed
this &s;cene with the pen of a Ma&s;ter; and
certainly draws the picture after the de&s;cription
of Atkins.</P>
<P>Many European nations abandon the Ne|groes
to the caprice of their ma&s;ters, or to the

that they are eternal records of Euro|pean
cupidity and European inhumanity.</P>
<P>In a word, they have reduced them to the

with infinitely more inhumanity. Whatever the
arbitrary decrees of a Planter&mdash;continues our

<HEAD>A NEW RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the world knows how &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ome
impo&s;tors have been in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
Religions. We Europeans are well per&s;uaded,
that the Jewi&s;h and the Chri&s;tian are derived
from Divine authority. We are perfectly &s;atis|fied
that Mahomet, Manco Capac, Confucius,
the Lama of Tartary, are impo&s;tors. Though
a greater number of nations re&s;pect <HI>their</HI> va|rious
holy &s;criptures than the true Bible, as
voyagers have made new di&s;coveries, new Re|ligions
have been di&s;covered. The li&s;t of re|ligious
impo&s;tors it is not difficult to augment.
The Jews have &s;een five or &s;ix fictitious Me&s;|&s;iahs&mdash;Sabbatei Sevi the mo&s;t remarkable of
them. I am convinced, that not a few Re|ligions
<PB N="380" REF="397">
have failed in their e&s;tabli&s;hment; and
I will oppo&s;e to the&s;e impo&s;tors a man, who
was more learned and able than any of them.
But circum&s;tances were not favourable to his
&s;y&s;tem: he had not, like Mahomet, to join with
his Alcoran, a good armoury of &s;words in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About the middle of the fifteenth century,
&s;ome time before the Turks had become ma|&s;ters
of Con&s;tantinople, a great number of
Philo&s;ophers flouri&s;hed. <HI>Gemi&s;tus Plethon</HI>
was one di&s;tingui&s;hed by the excellence of his
genius, by the depth of his erudition, and
chiefly by his being a warm Platoni&s;t. Such
were his eminent abilities, that, in his old age,
tho&s;e whom his novel &s;y&s;tem had greatly irri|tated,
either feared or re&s;pected him. He had
&s;carcely breathed his la&s;t moments, when they
began to abu&s;e Plato and our Plethon. Here
is an account, written by George of Trebi|zond&mdash;</P>
<P>' There has lately aro&s;e, among&s;t us, a &s;econd
<PB N="381" REF="398">
Mahomet; and this &s;econd, if we do not take
care, will exceed in greatne&s;s the fir&s;t, by the
dreadful con&s;equences of his wicked doctrine,
as the fir&s;t has exceeded Plato. A di&s;ciple and
rival of this Philo&s;opher, in philo&s;ophy, in
eloquence, and in &s;cience, he had fixed his re|&s;idence
in the Peloponne&s;e. His common name
was <HI>Gemi&s;tus,</HI> but he a&s;&s;umed that of <HI>Plethon.</HI>
Perhaps Gemi&s;tus, to make us believe more
ea&s;ily that he was de&s;cended from heaven, and
to engage us to receive more readily his doc|trine
and his new law, wi&s;hed to change his
name, according to the manner of the ancient
patriarchs; of whom it is &s;aid, that at the time
the name was changed they were called to the
greate&s;t things. He has writen with wonder|ful
art, and with great elegance. He has given
new rules for the conduct of life, and for the
regulation of human affairs; and, at the &s;ame
time, has vomited forth a great number of bla&s;|phemies
again&s;t the Catholic religion. It is cer|tain,
he was &s;o zealous a Platoni&s;t, that he enter|tained
<PB N="382" REF="399">
no other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of Plato,
concerning the nature of the Gods, Souls,
Sacrifices, &amp;c. I have heard him, my&s;elf,
when we were together at Florence, &s;ay that,
in a few years, all men on the face of the
earth would embrace, with one common con|&s;ent,
and with one mind, a &s;ingle and &s;imple
religion, at the fir&s;t in&s;tructions which &s;hould
be given by a &s;ingle preaching. And when I
a&s;ked him, if it would be the religion of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, or that of Mahomet? he an&s;wered,
"Neither one nor the other; but a <HI>third,</HI>
which will not greatly differ from <HI>Pagani&s;m.</HI>"
The&s;e words I heard with &s;o much indignation,
that &s;ince that time I have always hated him:
I look upon him as a dangerous viper; and I
cannot think of him without abhorrence.'</P>
<P>The pious writer of this account is too vio|lently
agitated: he might, perhaps, have be|&s;towed
a &s;mile of pity, or contempt; but the
bigots of religion are not le&s;s in&s;ane than the
impious them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="400">
It was when Plethon died, that the malice
of his enemies collected all it's venom. We
cannot but acknowledge, from this circum|&s;tance,
that his abilities mu&s;t have been a&s;toni&s;h|ingly
va&s;t, to have kept &s;uch crowds &s;ilent:
and, it is not improbable, this &s;cheme of
impiety was le&s;s impious than the majority
of the people imagined. Not a few Catholic
writers lament that his Book was burnt, and
greatly regret the lo&s;s of Plethon's work;
which, they &s;ay, was not meant to &s;ubvert the
Chri&s;tian religion, but only to unfold the &s;y&s;tem
of Plato, and to collect what he and other
Philo&s;ophers had written on Religion and Poli|ticks.
At the &s;ame time, however, we mu&s;t
recollect the expre&s;s words of Plethon, which
we come from tran&s;cribing as given us by
George of Trebizond.</P>
<P>Of his religious &s;cheme, the reader may now
judge, by this &s;ummary account. The general
title of the volume ran thus&mdash;'This Book
treats of the Laws, of the be&s;t Form of Go|vernment,
<PB N="384" REF="401">
and what all Men mu&s;t ob&s;erve in
their public and private Stations, to live toge|ther
in the mo&s;t perfect, the mo&s;t innocent,
and the mo&s;t happy Manner.' The whole was
divided into Three Books. The titles of the
chapters, where Pagani&s;m was openly incul|cated,
are reported by Gennadius, who con|demned
it to the flames, but who has not
thought proper to enter into the manner of his
arguments, &amp;c. The impiety and the extra|vagance
of this new Legi&s;lator appeared, above
all, in the articles which concerned Religion.
He acknowledges a plurality of gods: &s;ome
&s;uperior, whom he placed above the heavens;
and the others, inferior, on this &s;ide the hea|vens.
The fir&s;t, exi&s;ting from the remote&s;t
antiquity; the others younger, and of different
ages. He gave a King to all the&s;e gods; and
he called him &Zgr;&Egr;&Ugr;&Sgr;&mdash;or <HI>Jupiter</HI>&mdash;as the Pagans
named this power formerly. According to
him, the Stars had a Soul; the Demons were
not malignant Spirits; and the World was
<PB N="385" REF="402">
eternal. He e&s;tabli&s;hed Polygamy; and was
even inclined to a community of women. All
his work was filled with &s;uch follies; and with
not a few impieties, which my pious Author
will not venture to give.</P>
<P>What the intentions of Plethon were, it
would be ra&s;h and ungenerous in us to deter|mine.
If the work was only an arrangement
of the Heathen notions, it was an innocent
and curious volume. It is allowed, that he was
uncommonly learned and humane, and had
not pa&s;&s;ed his life entirely in the &s;olitary re|ce&s;&s;es
of his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this article, without recollect|ing
two &s;imilar works even of the pre&s;ent day.
The ideas of the phrenetic <HI>Emanuel Sweden|burgh</HI>
are warmly cheri&s;hed by a &s;ect, who have
&s;o far di&s;graced them&s;elves as to be&s;tow on their
&s;ociety the name of this man. It is but very
lately that a work was publi&s;hed, by a Mr. T.
Taylor, who openly profe&s;&s;ed Pagani&s;m! A
book publi&s;hed by the <HI>Athenian Stuart,</HI> as he
<PB N="386" REF="403">
is called, is not le&s;s to be di&s;tingui&s;hed&mdash;Yet

<HEAD>EDWARD THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Edward the Fourth was a gay and
voluptuous Prince; and, what is &s;ingular, he
probably owed to his enormous debts, and
pa&s;&s;ion for the fair-&s;ex, his crown. He had
not <HI>one</HI> Jane Shore, but <HI>many.</HI> Hear hone&s;t
Philip de Comines, his contemporary. He
&s;ays, that what greatly contributed to his en|tering
London as &s;oon as he appeared at it's
gates, was the great debts this Prince had con|tracted,
which made his creditors gladly a&s;&s;i&s;t
him; and the high favour in which he was
held by the <HI>Bourgeoi&s;es,</HI> into who&s;e good graces
he had frequently glided, and who gained him
over their hu&s;bands&mdash;who, I &s;uppo&s;e, for the
<PB N="387" REF="404">

or rai&s;e Monarchs.</P>
<P>The&s;e are De Comine's words&mdash;'Many
ladies, and rich citizens wives, of whom for|merly
he had great privacies and familiar ac|quaintance,
gained over to him their hu&s;bands
and relations.'</P>
<P>This is the de&s;cription of his voluptuous
life: we mu&s;t recollect, that the writer had been
an eye-witne&s;s, and was an hone&s;t man; while
modern Hi&s;torians only view objects through
the coloured medium of their imagination, and
do not always merit the latter appellation.</P>
<P>' He had been, during the la&s;t twelve years,
more accu&s;tomed to his ea&s;e and plea&s;ures than
any other Prince who lived in his time. He
had nothing in his thoughts but <HI>les dames,</HI> and
of them more than was <HI>rea&s;onable</HI>; and hunt|ing-matches,
good eating, and great care of
his per&s;on. When he went, in their &s;ea&s;ons,
to the&s;e hunting-matches, he always cau&s;ed to
be carried with him great pavilions for <HI>les</HI><PB N="388" REF="405">
<HI>dames</HI>; and, at the &s;ame time, gave &s;plendid
entertainments: &s;o that it is not &s;urprizing
that his per&s;on was as jolly as any one I ever
&s;aw. He was then young, and as hand&s;ome
as any man of his age; but he has &s;ince be|come

<P>Since I have got old Philip in my hand, the

the times. He now relates what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
Edward and the King of France&mdash;</P>
<P>' When the ceremony of the oath was con|cluded,
our King, who was de&s;irous of being
friendly, began to &s;ay to the King of England,
in a laughing way, that he mu&s;t come to Paris,

would give him the Cardinal de Bourbon for
his Confe&s;&s;or, who would very willingly ab|&s;olve
him of any <HI>&s;in</HI> which perchance he might
commit. The King of England &s;eemed well-plea&s;ed
at the invitation, and laughed heartily;
<PB N="389" REF="406">
for he knew that the &s;aid Cardinal was <HI>un fort
bon compagnon.</HI> When the King was return|ing,
he &s;poke on the road to me; and &s;aid,
that he did not like to find the King of Eng|land
&s;o much inclined to come to Paris. "He
is," &s;aid he, "a very <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> King; he likes
the women too much. He may probably find
one at Paris that may make him like to come
too often, or &s;tay too long. His predece&s;&s;ors
have already been too much at Paris and in

agreeable <HI>this &s;ide of the &s;ea</HI>; but that, beyond

<HEAD>A RELIC.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY the Third was deeply tainted with
the vile&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. He was a Prince of a
<PB N="390" REF="407">
da&s;tardly di&s;po&s;ition; and, like all bigots,
endeavoured, by mean &s;ubterfuge and low

hone&s;t man not bigotted to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s rites
of &s;uper&s;tition. As an in&s;tance of his bigotry,
take this account of a Relic which is too
curious to abridge&mdash;</P>
<P>' Henry &s;ummoned all the great men of
the kingdom, A. D. 1247, to come to London
on the fe&s;tival of Saint Edward, to receive an
account of a certain &s;acred benefit which
<HI>Heaven</HI> had lately be&s;towed on England. The
&s;ingular &s;train of this &s;ummons excited the
mo&s;t eager curio&s;ity, and brought great multi|tudes
to London at the time appointed. When
they were all a&s;&s;embled in Saint Paul's Church,
the King acquainted them, that the Great
Ma&s;ter of the Knights Templars had &s;ent him,
by one of his Knights, a phial of cry&s;tal, contain|ing
a <HI>&s;mall portion of the precious blood of Chri&s;t,</HI>
which he had &s;hed upon the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> for the &s;al|vation
<PB N="391" REF="408">
of the world, <HI>atte&s;ted to be genuine</HI> by
the &s;eals of the Patriarch of Jeru&s;alem, of
&s;everal Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and Abbots.
This, he informed them, he de&s;igned to carry,
the next day, in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, to We&s;t|min&s;ter,
attended by them, and by all the
Clergy of London, in their proper habits, with
their banners, crucifixes, and wax-candles;
and exhorted all who were pre&s;ent to prepare
them&s;elves for that &s;acred &s;olemnity, by &s;pend|ing
the night in watching, fa&s;ting, and devout
exerci&s;es. On the morrow, when the pro|ce&s;&s;ion
was put in order, the King approached
the &s;acred phial with <HI>reverence, fear,</HI> and

<P>THE Etiquette&mdash;or Rules to be ob&s;erved in

Bielfield, for keeping order at court. In Spain,
it was carried to &s;uch lengths as to make mar|tyrs
of their Kings. Here is an in&s;tance; at
which, in &s;pite of the fatal con&s;equences it
produced, one cannot refrain from &s;miling&mdash;</P>
<P>Philip the Third being <HI>gravely &s;eated</HI>&mdash;as
Spaniards generally are&mdash;by a chimney where
the fire-maker of the court had kindled &s;o great
a quantity of wood that the Monarch was
nearly &s;uffocated with heat, his <HI>grandeur</HI> would
not &s;uffer him to ri&s;e from the chair; and the
dome&s;tics could not <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to enter the apart|ment,
becau&s;e it was again&s;t the <HI>Etiquette.</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="411">
At length, the Marquis de Potat appeared, and
the King ordered him to damp the fires: but
<HI>he</HI> excu&s;ed him&s;elf; alledging, that he was
forbidden by the <HI>Etiquette</HI> to perform &s;uch a
function, for which the Duke D'U&s;&s;eda ought
to be called upon, as it was his bu&s;ine&s;s. The
Duke was gone out; the <HI>fire</HI> burnt fiercer; and
the <HI>King</HI> endured it, rather than derogate from
his <HI>dignity.</HI> But his blood was heated to &s;uch
a degree, that an ery&s;ipelas broke out in his
head the next day; which, being &s;ucceeded
by a violent fever, carried him off in 1621,
and in the twenty-fourth year of his age.</P>
<P>The palace was once on fire; when a &s;oldier,
who knew the King's &s;i&s;ter was in her apart|ment,
and mu&s;t inevitably have been con&s;umed
in a few moments by the flames, at the ri&s;k of
his life, ru&s;hed in, and brought her Highne&s;s

was here woefully broken into! The loyal
&s;oldier was brought to trial; and, as it was im|po&s;&s;ible

the judges condemned him to die! The

the deepe&s;t place is <HI>Hell</HI>; which contains
all the &s;ouls of the damned, where will be
al&s;o their bodies after the Re&s;urrection, and
where likewi&s;e will be inclo&s;ed all the Demons.
The place neare&s;t Hell is <HI>Purgatory,</HI> where
&s;ouls are purged; or, rather, where they ap|pea&s;e
the anger of God by their &s;ufferings.
He &s;ays, that the &s;ame fires, and the &s;ame

<HEAD>THE LOVER'S HEART.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tale is recorded in the Hi&s;to|rical
Memoirs of Champagne, by Bougier. It
has been a favourite narrative with the old
Romance writers; and the principal incident,
however objectionable, has been di&s;played in &s;e|veral
modern poems. It is probable, that the
<HI>true</HI> Hi&s;tory will be acceptable, for it's tender
and amorous incident, to the fair reader.</P>
<P>The Lord De Coucy, va&s;&s;al to the Count De
Champagne, was one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
youths of his time. He loved, with an exce&s;s
of pa&s;&s;ion, the lady of the Lord Du Fayel, who
felt for him reciprocal ardours. It was with
the mo&s;t poignant grief, this lady heard her
lover acquaint her, that he had re&s;olved to ac|company
the King and the Count De Cham|pagne
<PB N="401" REF="418">
to the wars of the Holy Land; but &s;he
could not oppo&s;e his wi&s;hes, becau&s;e &s;he hop|ed
that his ab&s;ence might di&s;&s;ipate the jealou&s;y
of her hu&s;band. The time of departure hav|ing
come, the&s;e two lovers parted with &s;orrows
of the mo&s;t lively tenderne&s;s. The lady, in
quitting her lover, pre&s;ented him with &s;ome
rings, &s;ome diamonds, and with a &s;tring that
&s;he had woven her&s;elf of his own hair, inter|mixed
with &s;ilk and buttons of large pearls,
to &s;erve him, according to the fa&s;hion of tho&s;e
days, to tie a magnificent hood which covered
his helmet. This he gratefully accepted, and
in&s;tantly departed.</P>
<P>When he arrived in Pale&s;tine, he received at
the &s;iege of Acre, in 1191, in gloriou&s;ly a&s;|cending
the ramparts, a wound, which was
declared mortal. He employed the few mo|ments
he had to live, in writing to the Lady
Du Fayel; and he made u&s;e of tho&s;e fervid
expre&s;&s;ions which were natural to him in his
afflictive &s;ituation. He ordered his Squire to
<PB N="402" REF="419">
embalm his heart after his death, and to con|vey
it to his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, with the pre|&s;ents
he had received from her hands in quit|ting
her.</P>
<P>The Squire, faithful to the dying commands
of his ma&s;ter, returned immediately to France,
to pre&s;ent the heart and the pre&s;ents to the
Lady of Du Fayel. But, when he approached
the ca&s;tle of this lady, he concealed him&s;elf in
the neighbouring wood, till he could find &s;ome
favourable moment to compleat his promi&s;e.
He had the misfortune to be ob&s;erved by the
hu&s;band of this lady, who recognized him, and
who immediately &s;u&s;pected he came in &s;earch
of his wife with &s;ome me&s;&s;age from his ma&s;ter.
He threatened to deprive him of his life, if he
did not divulge what had occa&s;ioned him to
come there. The Squire gave him for an&s;wer,
that his ma&s;ter was dead; but Du Fayel not
believing it, drew his &s;word to murder him.
This man, frightened at the peril in which he
found him&s;elf, confe&s;&s;ed every thing; and put
<PB N="403" REF="420">
into his hands the heart and letter of his ma|&s;ter.
Du Fayel, prompted by the felle&s;t re|venge,
ordered his cook to mince the heart;
and, having mixed it with meat, he cau&s;ed a
ragout to be made, which he knew plea&s;ed the
ta&s;te of his wife, and had it &s;erved to her.
This lady eat greedily of the di&s;h. After the
repa&s;t, Du Fayel inquired of his wife, if &s;he
had found the ragout according to her ta&s;te:
&s;he an&s;wered him, that &s;he had found it excel|lent.
'It is for this rea&s;on,' he replied, 'that
I cau&s;ed it to be &s;erved to you, for it is a kind
of meat which you very much liked. You
have, Madam,' the &s;avage Du Fayel continued,
'eat the heart of the Lord De Coucy.' But this
&s;he would not believe, till he &s;hewed her the
letter of her lover, with the &s;tring of his
hair, and the diamonds &s;he had given him.
Then, &s;huddering in the angui&s;h of her &s;en&s;a|tions,
and urged by the darke&s;t de&s;pair, &s;he
told him&mdash;'It is true that I loved that heart,
becau&s;e it merited to be loved: for never could
<PB N="404" REF="421">
it find it's &s;uperior; and, &s;ince I have eaten of
&s;o noble a meat, and that my &s;tomach is the
tomb of &s;o precious a heart, I will take care
that nothing of inferior worth &s;hall be mixed
with it.' Grief and pa&s;&s;ion choaked her ut|terance.
She retired into her chamber: &s;he
clo&s;ed the door for ever; and, refu&s;ing to ac|cept
of con&s;olation or food, the amiable victim
expired on the fourth day.</P>

I have compiled from the papers of an

be found in the Republic of Letters. Vol. X.
p. 289.</P>
<P>To proceed regularly, we mu&s;t fir&s;t enquire
into the antiquity of this part of dre&s;s; and
&s;econdly, &s;hew it's various u&s;es in the &s;everal
ages of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="422">
Some have given them a very early original,
imagining they are noticed in the 108th P&s;alm,
where the Royal Prophet declares, he will ca&s;t
his <HI>Shoe</HI> over Edom. They go &s;till higher;
&s;uppo&s;ing them to be u&s;ed in the times of the
Judges, Ruth iv. 7. where it is &s;aid, it
was the cu&s;tom for a man to take off his <HI>Shoe,</HI>
and give it to his neighbour, as a token of re|deeming
or exchanging any thing. They
tell us, <HI>the word</HI> which in the&s;e two texts is
u&s;ually tran&s;lated <HI>Shoe,</HI> is by the Chaldee pa|raphra&s;t
in the latter, rendered <HI>Glove.</HI> Ca&s;aubon
is of opinion, that <HI>Gloves</HI> were worn by the
Chaldeans, becau&s;e the word here mentioned
is in the Talmud Lexicon explained, <HI>the cloath|ing
of the hand.</HI> But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, all
the&s;e are mere conjectures; and the Chaldean
paraphra&s;t has taken an unallowable liberty in
his ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us, then, be content to begin with the
authority of <HI>Xenophon.</HI> He gives a clear and
di&s;tinct account of <HI>Gloves.</HI> Speaking of the
<PB N="406" REF="423">
manners of the Per&s;ians, he gives us a proof
of their effeminacy; that, not &s;atisfied with
covering their head and their feet, they al&s;o
guarded their hands again&s;t the cold with <HI>thick
Gloves. Homer,</HI> &s;peaking of Laertes at work
in his garden, repre&s;ents him with <HI>Gloves on
his hands, to &s;ecure them from the thorns. Var|ro,</HI>
an ancient Writer, is an evidence in favour
of their antiquity among the Romans. In Lib.
ii. Cap. 55. <HI>de Re Ru&s;tica,</HI> he &s;ays, that olives
gathered by the naked hand, are preferable to
tho&s;e gathered with <HI>Gloves. Athenaeus</HI> &s;peaks
of a celebrated glutton, who always came to
table with <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands, that he might
be able to handle and eat the meat while hot,
and devour more than the re&s;t of the com|pany.</P>
<P>The&s;e authorities &s;hew, that the ancients
were not &s;trangers to <HI>Gloves</HI>; though, perhaps,
their u&s;e might not be &s;o common as among&s;t
us. When the ancient &s;everity of manners
declined, the u&s;e of <HI>Gloves</HI> prevailed among
<PB N="407" REF="424">
the Romans; but not without &s;ome oppo&s;ition
from the Philo&s;ophers. <HI>Mu&s;onius,</HI> a Philo&s;o|pher,
who lived at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t cen|tury
of Chri&s;tianity, among other invectives
again&s;t the corruption of the age, &s;ays, <HI>It is a
&s;hame, that per&s;ons in perfect health &s;hould clothe
their hands and feet with &s;oft and hairy cover|ings.</HI>
Their convenience, however, &s;oon made
their u&s;e general. <HI>Pliny</HI> the Younger informs
us, in his account of his uncle's journey to
Ve&s;uvius, that his &s;ecretary &s;at by him, ready
to write down whatever occurred remarkable;
and that he had <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands, that
the coldne&s;s of the weather might not impede
his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the ninth century, the
u&s;e of <HI>Gloves</HI> was become &s;o univer&s;al, that
ever the Church thought a regulation in that
part of dre&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. In the reign of <HI>Lewis
le Debonnaire,</HI> the Council of Aix ordered, that
the Monks &s;hould only wear <HI>Gloves</HI> made of
&s;heep-&s;kin.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="425">
That Time has made alterations in the form
of this, as in all other apparel, appears from the
old pictures and monuments.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to point out the various
u&s;es of <HI>Gloves</HI> in the &s;everal ages; for, be&s;ide
their original de&s;ign for a covering of the
hand, they have been employed on &s;everal
great and &s;olemn occa&s;ions: as in the cere|mony
of <HI>Inve&s;titures,</HI> in be&s;towing lands; or,
in conferring <HI>dignities.</HI> Giving po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by
the delivery of a <HI>Glove,</HI> prevailed in &s;everal
parts of Chri&s;tendom in later ages. In the
year 1002, the Bi&s;hops of Paderborn and Mon|cerco
were put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Sees by
receiving a <HI>Glove.</HI> It was thought &s;o e&s;&s;ential
a part of the epi&s;copal habit, that &s;ome Ab|bots
in France, pre&s;uming to wear <HI>Gloves,</HI> the
Council of Poitiers interpo&s;ed in the affair, and
forbid them the u&s;e of them, on the &s;ame
footing with the ring and &s;andals, as being pe|culiar
to Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Favin ob&s;erves, that the cu&s;tom of
<PB N="409" REF="426">
ble&s;&s;ing <HI>Gloves</HI> at the Coronation of the Kings
of France, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, is a remain of
the Ea&s;tern practice of Inve&s;titure by <HI>a Glove.</HI>
A remarkable in&s;tance of this ceremony is re|corded
in the German Hi&s;tory. The unfortu|nate
<HI>Conradin</HI> was deprived of his crown and
his life by the u&s;urper <HI>Mainfroy.</HI> When, hav|ing
a&s;cended the &s;caffold, the injured Prince
lamented his hard fate, he a&s;&s;erted his right to
the Crown; and, as a token of Inve&s;titure,
threw his <HI>Glove</HI> among the crowd; begging it
might be conveyed to &s;ome of his relations,
who &s;hould revenge his death. It was ta|ken
up by a Knight, who brought it to Peter,
King of Arragon, who was afterwards crown|ed
at Palermo.</P>
<P>As the delivery of <HI>Gloves</HI> was once a part
of the ceremony u&s;ed in giving po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o
the depriving a per&s;on of them, was a mark of
dive&s;ting him of his office, and of degrading
him. Andrew Herkley, Earl of Carli&s;le, was,
in the reign of Edward the Second, impeach|ed
<PB N="410" REF="427">
of holding a corre&s;pondence with the Scots,
and condemned to die as a traitor. Wal&s;ing|ham,
relating other circum&s;tances of his de|gradation,
&s;ays&mdash;'His &s;purs were cut off
with a hatchet; and his <HI>Gloves</HI> and &s;hoes
were taken off, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Another u&s;e of <HI>Gloves</HI> was in a duel: on
which occa&s;ion, he who threw one down, was
thereby under&s;tood to give defiance; and he
who took it up, to accept the challenge.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of &s;ingle combat, at fir&s;t de&s;igned
only for a trial of innocence, like the ordeal
fire and water, was, in &s;ucceeding ages, prac|ti&s;ed
for deciding right and property. Chal|lenging
by the <HI>Glove</HI> was continued down to
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as appears by
an account given by Spelman, of a duel ap|pointed
to be fought in Tothill Fields, in the
year 1571. The di&s;pute was concerning &s;ome
lands in the county of Kent. The Plaintiffs
appeared in Court, and demanded a &s;ingle
combat. One of them threw down his <HI>Glove.</HI>
<PB N="411" REF="428">
which the other immediately took up, carried
off on the point of his &s;word, and the day of
fighting was appointed; but the matter was
adju&s;ted in an amicable manner by the Queen's
judicious interference.</P>
<P>Though &s;uch combats are now no longer in
u&s;e, we have one ceremony &s;till remaining
among us, in which the challenge is given by
a <HI>Glove</HI>; viz. at the Coronation of the Kings
of England: upon which occa&s;ion, his Ma|je&s;ty's
champion, compleatly armed, and well
mounted, enters We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, and pro|claims
that, if any man &s;hall deny the Prince's
title to the crown, he is ready to maintain and
defend it by &s;ingle combat. After which de|claration,
he throws down his <HI>Glove,</HI> or gaunt|let,
as a token of defiance.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom of challenging by the <HI>Glove</HI> is
&s;till in u&s;e in &s;ome parts of the world. It is
common in Germany, on receiving an affront,
to &s;end a <HI>Glove</HI> to the offending party, as a
challenge to a duel.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="429">
The la&s;t u&s;e of <HI>Gloves</HI> to be mentioned here
was for carrying the <HI>Hawk,</HI> which is very an|cient.
In former times, Princes and other
great men took &s;o much plea&s;ure in carrying
the Hawk on their hand, that &s;ome of them
have cho&s;en to be repre&s;ented in this attitude.
There is a monument of Philip the Fir&s;t
of France &s;till remaining; on which he is
repre&s;ented at length, on his tomb, holding a
<HI>Glove</HI> in his hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers &s;ays that, formerly, judges
were forbid to wear <HI>Gloves</HI> on the bench. No
rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned for this prohibition. Our
judges lie under no &s;uch re&s;traint; for both
they and the re&s;t of the court make no diffi|culty
of receiving <HI>Gloves</HI> from the &s;heriffs,
whenever the &s;e&s;&s;ion or a&s;&s;ize concludes with|out
any one receiving &s;entence of death, which
is called a <HI>Maiden A&s;&s;ize.</HI> This cu&s;tom is of
great antiquity.</P>
<P>Our curious Antiquarian has al&s;o pre&s;erved
a very &s;ingular anecdote concerning <HI>Gloves.</HI>
<PB N="413" REF="430">
Chambers informs us, that it is not &s;afe at pre|&s;ent
to enter the &s;tables of Princes without
pulling off the <HI>Gloves.</HI> He does not, indeed,
tell us in what the danger con&s;i&s;ts. A friend
from Germany explains the matter. He &s;ays,
it is an ancient e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom in that coun|try,
that whoever enters the &s;tables of a Prince,
or great man, with his <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands,
is obliged to forfeit them, or redeem them by
a fee to the &s;ervants. The &s;ame cu&s;tom is ob|&s;erved
in &s;ome places at the death of the &s;tag;
in which ca&s;e, the <HI>Gloves,</HI> if not taken off, are
redeemed by money given to the hunt&s;men
and keepers. This is practi&s;ed in France; and
the late King never failed of pulling off one of
his <HI>Gloves</HI> on that occa&s;ion. The rea&s;on of this
ceremony is not known.</P>
<P>We meet with the term <HI>Glove-money</HI> in our
old records; by which is meant, money given
to &s;ervants to buy <HI>Gloves.</HI> This, no doubt,
gave ri&s;e to the &s;aying of <HI>giving a pair of</HI>
<PB N="414" REF="431">
<HI>Gloves,</HI> to &s;ignify making a pre&s;ent for &s;ome
favour or &s;ervice.</P>
<P>To the honour of the <HI>Glove,</HI> it has more
than once been admitted as a term of the tenure
or holding lands. One Bortran, who came in
with William the Conqueror, held the Manor
of Farnham Royal by the &s;ervice of providing
a <HI>Glove</HI> for the King's right-hand on the day
of his coronation, and &s;upporting the &s;ame
hand that day while the King held the royal
&s;ceptre. In the year 1177, Simon de Mertin
gave a grant of his lands in con&s;ideration of
fifteen &s;hillings, one pair of <HI>white Gloves</HI> at
Ea&s;ter, and one pound of cummin.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent is an article that, perhaps,

of a very ill-favoured countenance, and who&s;e
eyes were continually declined on the ground.
<PB N="416" REF="433">
It was &s;aid, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a wonderful
degree, an Artificial Memory. To give a proof
of his powers, he begged the company, who
were numerous, to &s;eat them&s;elves regularly,
that he might not be di&s;turbed; and that they
would order to be written down to the number
of <HI>fifty thou&s;and words:</HI> a&s;&s;uring them, that if
they pronounced them di&s;tinctly, and if after|wards
they were read &s;lowly, he would repeat
every word without he&s;itation. This was done.
They would only have troubled him with a
few: but he in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould proceed.
The Secretary of the Amba&s;&s;ador was employed
full <HI>two hours</HI> in writing the mo&s;t &s;ingular
words the company could &s;elect; and, among
them, was a Cardinal Peleve, who gave him
Poly&s;yllables in the be&s;t or longe&s;t manner of
our late Lexicographer. The Florentine, to the
a&s;toni&s;hment of the audience, recited them
without the &s;malle&s;t omi&s;&s;ion; and this he did,
beginning &s;ometimes at the end, and &s;ometimes

There was a work of this kind which Menage

Boileau, the Satiri&s;t, &s;tood at the door of the
gallery, hindering &s;even or eight bad Poets

<HEAD>LIGHT SUMMER SHOWERS FORMING BURN|ING
MIRRORS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Summer, after &s;ome days of fine wea|ther,
during the heat of the day, if a &s;torm
happens, accompanied with a few light Showers
of rain; and if the Sun appears immediately
after with all it's u&s;ual ardour, it burns the
foliage, and the flowers on which the rain had
<PB N="426" REF="443">
fallen, and de&s;troys the hopes of the orchard.
The burning heat, which the ardour of the Sun
produces at that time on the leaves and flowers,
is equal to the inten&s;e heat of <HI>burning Iron.</HI>
Naturali&s;ts have &s;ought for the cau&s;e of this
&s;trange effect, but they have &s;aid nothing
which &s;atisfies a rea&s;onable mind. This is,
however, the fact. In the &s;erene days of the
Summer, it is vi&s;ible that there gathers on the
foliage and the flowers as, indeed, on every
other part, a little du&s;t, &s;ometimes more and
&s;ometimes le&s;s, &s;cattered by the wind. When
the rain falls on this du&s;t, the drops mix to|gether,
and take an oval or round form, as we
may frequently ob&s;erve in our hou&s;es, on the
du&s;ty floor or cieling, when they &s;catter water
before they &s;weep them. It is thus the&s;e globes
of water, mingled on the foliage, form &s;o
many of tho&s;e convex gla&s;&s;es which we call
Burning, Mirrors, and which produce the &s;ame
effect. Should the rain be heavy and la&s;t long,
the Sun would not then produce this burning
<PB N="427" REF="444">
heat, becau&s;e the force, and the duration of the
rain, will have de&s;troyed the du&s;t which form|ed
the&s;e drops of water; and the&s;e drops, lo&s;ing
their globular form, in which alone con&s;i&s;ted
their cau&s;tic power, will be di&s;per&s;ed without
any extraordinary effect. For this ob&s;ervation,
which, to the Naturali&s;t mu&s;t appear curious
and novel, he is indebted to the ingenious

<HEAD>BLEEDING AND EVACUATION, TWO REME|DIES
FOR LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>HUET has a very &s;ingular ob&s;ervation on
Love, which he exemplifies by an Anecdote
as &s;ingular.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> he &s;ays, is not merely a pa&s;&s;ion of
the &s;oul, but it is al&s;o a di&s;ea&s;e of the body,
like <HI>the Fever.</HI> It is frequently in the blood,
and in the mind, which are terribly agitated;
and, to be cured, it may be treated as <HI>metho|dically</HI>
<PB N="428" REF="445">
as any other di&s;order. Great per&s;pira|tions,
and copious Bleedings, that carry away
with the humour the inflammable &s;pirits, would
purge the blood, calm the emotions, and re|place
every part in it's natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>The great Cond&eacute;, having felt a violent pa&s;&s;ion
for Mademoi&s;elle de Vigean, was con&s;trained to
join the army. While his ab&s;ence la&s;ted, his pa&s;|&s;ion
was continually nouri&s;hed by the tendere&s;t
recollections of Love, and by an intercour&s;e of
a continued corre&s;pondence, till the conclu&s;ion
of the campaign, when a dangerous &s;ickne&s;s
brought him to the mo&s;t imminent danger.
To the violence of his illne&s;s, violent Reme|dies
were applied; and every thing that was
mo&s;t efficacious in phy&s;ic was given to the
Prince. He regained his <HI>health,</HI> but he had
lo&s;t his <HI>Love:</HI> the great Evacuations had car|ried
away his pa&s;&s;ion; and when he thought
him&s;elf a Lover, he found he had cea&s;ed to
Love.</P>
<P>On this Anecdote it is to be ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="429" REF="446">
the fact is well authenticated; and, however the
reader may feel him&s;elf inclined to turn Wit on
this occa&s;ion, it's veracity cannot in the lea&s;t be
injured. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Evacu|ations</HI>
may not always have on a de&s;pairing
lover the &s;ame happy effect. 'When we would
explain the mechani&s;m of the human pa&s;&s;ions,'
ob&s;erves an ingenious writer, 'the ob&s;erva|tions
mu&s;t be multiplied.' This fact, then,
does not tend to &s;hew that the &s;ame remedies
will cure every lover, but that they did cure
the Prince de Cond&eacute;.</P>
<P>There is, however, another &s;pecies of eva|cuation,
not le&s;s efficacious, for a de&s;pairing
&s;wain, which will probably amu&s;e the reader.</P>
<P>A German gentleman burned with an amo|rous
flame for a German Prince&s;s. She was
not in&s;en&s;ible to a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion; and to
have him about her per&s;on, without giving
&s;candal, &s;he created him her General. They
lived &s;ome time much plea&s;ed with each other;
but the Prince&s;s became &s;ickle, and the Gene|ral
<PB N="430" REF="447">
grew jealous. He made very &s;harp remon|&s;trances;
and the Prince&s;s, who wi&s;hed to be
free, gave him his <HI>cong&eacute;,</HI> and he was con|&s;trained
to quit her. But his pa&s;&s;ion at every
hour increa&s;ed: he found he could not live out
of her pre&s;ence; and he ventured to enter im|perceptibly
into her cabinet. There he threw
him&s;elf at her feet, and entreated her forgive|ne&s;s.
The Prince&s;s frowned, and conde&s;cended
to give no other an&s;wer than a command to
withdraw from her Royal Highne&s;s's pre&s;ence.
The de&s;pairing lover exclaimed, that he was
ready to obey her in every thing but that; that
he was re&s;olved, in this, to di&s;obey her; and
that he preferred to die by her hand. In &s;ay|ing
this, to give force to his eloquence, he pre|&s;ented
his naked &s;word to the German Prince&s;s;
who, perhaps, being little acquainted with the
flowers of rhetoric, mo&s;t cruelly took him at
his word, and run him through the body.
Fortunately, the wound did not prove mortal:
<PB N="431" REF="448">
he was healed of his wound at the end of three
months; and likewi&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ion, which had
flowed away with the effu&s;ion of blood.</P>

<HEAD>INFECTIOUS DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent article, from the learned Bi&s;hop
of Avranches, if not a valuable, forms at lea&s;t
an ingenious &s;peculation.</P>
<P>Neither Naturali&s;ts or Phy&s;icians have in|formed
us, what is the cau&s;e which renders
contagious &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es, while others are
not in the lea&s;t infectious. The gout, the gra|vel,
the epilep&s;y, the apoplexy, are not caught
by frequenting the company of the di&s;ea&s;ed;
but the plague, the dy&s;entery, the itch, the
bloody-flux, occa&s;ion frequently terrible ra|vages
by their infection. This is very proba|bly
the fact. It may be &s;aid, in general, that
all contagious di&s;ea&s;es produce <HI>worms,</HI> which
are contained in ulcers, pu&s;tules, or pimples,
<PB N="432" REF="449">
either internal or external, &s;ome le&s;s and &s;ome
more, and of different kinds. We &s;hall not
here examine the cau&s;e of the productions of
the&s;e <HI>worms</HI>; but their effect is common and
unvaried, and &s;ometimes vi&s;ible. It is al&s;o
well known that the&s;e worms, by undergoing
a revolution, which in them is natural, change
into the fly &s;tate, and become <HI>gnats</HI>; this is
done in a &s;hort time, and in infinite numbers.
As &s;oon as the&s;e flies, imperceptible by their
diminutive &s;ize, can lift them&s;elves by their
wings, they take their flight. They are there
&s;cattered abroad; and, entering the bodies of
men by re&s;piration, they infu&s;e that poi&s;on by
which they are engendered, and communi|cate
that corruption from whence they have
&s;prung.</P>
<P>It is thus great fires have been found very
&s;erviceable in public contagions: kindled in
divers places, they have, as many imagine,
purified the air. The air is, indeed, purified,
but not in the manner generally &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="433" REF="450">
by rarifying and changing it's compo&s;ition,
but in burning and con&s;uming the&s;e flying
<HI>gnats</HI> with which the air is filled; and which,
attracted by the light of the flames, mix with
them, and are de&s;troyed in the &s;ame manner
as moths are by a candle. An oppo&s;ite cau&s;e
produces al&s;o the &s;ame effect; I mean, a &s;harp
fro&s;t, that kills and de&s;troys the&s;e terrible in|&s;ects,
if not entirely, at lea&s;t, the greater
part: for it has been known, that &s;o great have
been their numbers, that many have e&s;caped
the rigours of the fro&s;t, and have continued the
infection; as it happened &s;ome centuries back,
in the dreadful Plague, which de&s;olated Den|mark,
and the neighbouring countries.</P>

<HEAD>FEMALE BEAUTY, AND ORNAMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ladies in Japan gild their teeth; and
tho&s;e of the Indies paint them red. The blacke&s;t
<PB N="438" REF="457">
teeth are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beautiful in Gu|zurat,
and in &s;ome parts of America. In
Greenland, the women colour their faces with
blue and yellow. However fre&s;h the com|plexion
of a Mu&s;covite may be, &s;he would
think her&s;elf very ugly if &s;he was not plai&s;tered
over with paint. The Chine&s;e mu&s;t have
their feet as diminutive as tho&s;e of the &s;he|goats;
and, to render them thus, their youth
is pa&s;&s;ed in tortures. In Ancient Per&s;ia, and
aquiline no&s;e was often thought worthy of the
crown; and, if there was any competition be|tween
two Princes, the people generally went
by this criterion of maje&s;ty. In &s;ome coun|tries,
the mothers break the no&s;es of their
children; and, in others, pre&s;s the head be|tween
two boards, that it may become &s;quare.
The modern Per&s;ians have a &s;trong aver&s;ion
to red hair: the Turks, on the contrary, are
warm admirers of the&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting locks. The
Indian Beauty is thickly &s;meared with bear's
fat; and the female Hottentot receives from
<PB N="439" REF="458">
the hand of her lover, not &s;ilks, or wreaths of
flowers, but warm guts and reeking tripe, to
dre&s;s her&s;elf with enviable ornaments.</P>
<P>At China, &s;mall eyes are liked; and the
girls are continually plucking their eye-brows,
that they may be &s;mall and long. The Turki&s;h
women dip a gold bru&s;h in the tincture of a
black drug, which they pa&s;s over their eye-brows.
It is too vi&s;ible by day, but looks
&s;hining by night. They tinge their nails with
a ro&s;e-colour.</P>
<P>An ornament for the no&s;e appears to us
perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary. The Peruvians, how|ever,
think otherwi&s;e; and they hand on it a
weighty ring, the thickne&s;s of which is pro|portioned
by the rank of their hu&s;bands. The
cu&s;tom of boring it, as our Ladies do their ears,
is very common in &s;everal nations. Through
the perforation are hung various materials;
&s;uch as green cry&s;tal, gold, &s;tones, a &s;ingle and
&s;ometimes a great number of gold rings. This
is rather trouble&s;ome to them in blowing their
<PB N="440" REF="459">
no&s;es; and the fact is, &s;ome have informed us,
that the Indian Ladies never perform this very
u&s;eful operation.</P>
<P>The female head-dre&s;s is carried, in &s;ome
countries, to &s;ingular extravagance. The
Chine&s;e Fair carries on her head the figure of
a certain bird. This bird is compo&s;ed of cop|per,
or of gold, according to the quality of the
per&s;on: the wings, &s;pread out, fall over the
front of the head-dre&s;s, and conceal the temples.
The tail, long and open, forms a beautiful tuft
of feathers. The beak covers the top of the
no&s;e; the neck is fa&s;tened to the body of the
artificial animal by a &s;pring, that it may the
more freely play, and tremble at the &s;lighte&s;t
motion.</P>
<P>The extravagance of the Myant&s;es is far more
ridiculous than the above. They carry on their
heads a &s;light board, rather longer than a foot,
and about &s;ix inches broad: with this they
cover their hair, and &s;eal it with wax. They
cannot lie down, nor lean, without keeping the
<PB N="441" REF="460">
neck very &s;traight; and, the country being very
woody, it is not uncommon to find them with
their head-dre&s;s entangled in the trees. When|ever
they comb their hair, they pa&s;s an hour
by the fire in melting the wax; but this comb|ing
is only performed once or twice a year.</P>
<P>To this curious account, extracted from Du|halde,
we mu&s;t join that of the inhabitants of
the Land of Natal. They wear caps, or bon|nets,
from &s;ix to ten inches high, compo&s;ed of
the fat of oxen. They then gradually anoint the
head with a purer grea&s;e; which, mixing with
the hair, fa&s;tens the&s;e <HI>bonnets</HI> for their lives!</P>

An officer, having &s;poken &s;omewhat

of his in&s;trument, the rigours of his
pri&s;on. At the end of a few days, this mo|dern
Orpheus, playing on his lute, was great|ly
a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee fri&s;king out of their holes
great numbers of mice; and, de&s;cending from
their woven habitations, crouds of &s;piders, who
formed a circle about him, while he continued

At length, having conquered, for the

<HEAD>ANTI-MOINE, OR ANTIMONY; COFFEE; AND

<P>THE origin of <HI>Antimony</HI> is a remarkable

it would produce the &s;ame effect on the Holy
Brotherhood. But the ca&s;e was &s;eriou&s;ly
different: the unfortunate Fathers, who gree|dily
made u&s;e of it, died in a very &s;hort time.
This is the origin of it's name, which I have
written according to the pure French word. In
&s;pite of this unfortunate beginning, Paracel&s;us
re&s;olved to bring this mineral into practice;
he thought he could make it u&s;eful, by mixing
it with other preparations, but he did not &s;uc|ceed
according to his hopes. The Faculty, at
Paris, were on this occa&s;ion divided into two
parties: the one maintained, that <HI>Antimony</HI>
was a <HI>poi&s;on</HI>; the other affirmed, that it was an
excellent <HI>remedy.</HI> The di&s;pute became more
general, and the Parliament and the Sorbonne
interfered in the matter: but &s;ome time after|wards,
the world began to judge rightly con|cerning
this excellent mineral; and it's won|derful
effects have occa&s;ioned the Faculty to
place it among their be&s;t remedies.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="470">
The u&s;e of COFFEE is &s;aid to have a &s;imilar
origin; that, however, was never attended
with &s;uch dreadful effects. A Prior of a mo|na&s;tery
in the part of Arabia where this berry
grows, having remarked, that the Goats who
eat of it became extremely bri&s;k and alert, re|&s;olved
to try the experiment on his Monks, of
whom he &s;o continually complained for their
lethargic propen&s;ities. The experiment turn|ed
out &s;ucce&s;sful; and, it is &s;aid, it was owing
to this circum&s;tance, that the u&s;e of this Ara|bian
berry came to be &s;o univer&s;al.</P>
<P>A ca&s;ual circum&s;tance di&s;covered that ex|cellent
febrifuge, the JESUIT'S BARK. An
Indian, in a delirious fever, having been left
by his companions by the &s;ide of a river, as in|curable,
to quench his burning thir&s;t, he na|turally
drank copious draughts of the water,
which, having long imbibed the virtues of the
bark, which abundantly floated on the &s;tream,
it quickly di&s;per&s;ed the fever of the Indian.
He returned to his friends; and, having ex|plained
<PB N="452" REF="471">
the nature of his remedy, the indi&s;|po&s;ed
crouded about the margin of the holy
&s;tream, as they imagined it to be, till they per|fectly
exhau&s;ted all it's virtues. The Sages of
the tribe, however, found at length in what
con&s;i&s;ted the efficacy of the &s;tream. The Ame|ricans
di&s;covered it, in the year 1640, to the
lady of the Vice-roy of Peru, who recovered
by it's u&s;e from a dangerous fever. In 1649,
the reputation of this remedy was &s;pread about

<PB N="454" REF="473">
probably, urged by the in&s;atiable curio&s;ity of
the female, vi&s;ited this poetical King at his

him que&s;tions.</HI> The Rabbin cannot inform me,
if her examination of the Monarch was al|ways
made in the chamber of audience; there
is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they frequently retired,
for the &s;olution of many a hard problem, to the
philo&s;ophic &s;olitude of a private cabinet. But
I do not intend by any means to make this
work (as my Lord Lyttleton an&s;wered to a
curious female concerning his Hi&s;tory) 'a
vehicle for antiquated &s;candal.'</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, that the incident I now re|late
pa&s;&s;ed as Solomon &s;at &s;urrounded by his
court. At the foot of the throne &s;tood the
inqui&s;itive Sheba; in each hand, &s;he held a
wreath of flowers; the one, compo&s;ed of na|tural,
the other, of artificial flowers. Art, in
the labour of the mimic wreath, had exqui|&s;itely
emulated the lively hues, and the varie|gated
beauties of Nature; &s;o that, at the di&s;|tance
<PB N="455" REF="474">
it was held by the Queen for the in&s;pec|tion
of the King, it was deemed impo&s;&s;ible
for him to decide&mdash;as her que&s;tion imported&mdash;which wreath was the natural, and which the
artificial. The &s;agacious Solomon &s;eemed
po&s;ed; yet, to be vanqui&s;hed, though in a trifle
by a trifling woman, irritated his pride. The
&s;on of David&mdash;he who had written treati&s;es
on the vegetable productions 'from the ce|dar

outwitted by a woman, with &s;hreds of papers

Monarch's reputation for divine &s;agacity
&s;eemed dimini&s;hed; and the whole Jewi&s;h
court looked &s;olemn and melancholy. At length,
an expedient pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the King; and,
it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, worthy of the Natural
Philo&s;opher. Ob&s;erving a clu&s;ter of Bees
hovering about a window, he commanded that
it &s;hould be opened: it was opened; the
Bees ru&s;hed into Court, and alighted im|mediately

&s;ingle one fixed on the other. The deci&s;ion
was not then difficult; the learned Rabbins
&s;hook their beards in rapture, and the baffled
Sheba had one more rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed at
the wi&s;dom of Solomon.</P>
<P>This would make a pretty poetical Tale. It

<HEAD>HOW THE BELLS OF THE CHURCH STEEPLE
ADVISE ABOUT MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tory which Rabelais &s;o plea&s;antly has
given, in the &s;eventh chapter of his third book,
and the an&s;wer of Pantagruel to Panurge con|cerning
his intention of marrying, Menage

Widowhood, by a Monk of Cluny. The ori|ginal
pa&s;&s;age has &s;ufficient humour to induce
me to tran&s;cribe it&mdash;</P>
<P>A certain widow, who felt a very &s;trong in|clination
towards the holy bond of matrimony,
thought it mo&s;t decent to take the advice of
the Curate of her pari&s;h, who pa&s;&s;ed for what
is called <HI>a very good-natured &s;oul,</HI> becau&s;e he
<PB N="459" REF="478">
was di&s;po&s;ed to let every one act as they
thought proper. 'I am,' &s;aid &s;he, 'a poor
unhappy woman, who has lo&s;t the be&s;t hu&s;band
in the world. My apprentice knows all the
ways of his old ma&s;ter. I have often thought
I &s;hould do well to marry this young man;
but I wi&s;h to take your advice.' The Curate
immediately an&s;wered, that &s;he had then better
take him. 'Ah! but I have my fears,' re|joined
the widow: 'when a &s;ervant becomes
a ma&s;ter, it is dangerous.' The Curate ap|proved
of this &s;entiment, and advi&s;ed her not
to marry him. 'But what &s;hall I do?' ex|claimed
the widow: 'I cannot proceed in the
bu&s;ine&s;s my late hu&s;band left, unle&s;s I find
another.'&mdash;'True,' the Curate replied; 'you
will then do well to marry him.'&mdash;'Very well,'
&s;he an&s;wered: 'but, if he happens to turn out
bad, he may ruin me!'&mdash;'Very ju&s;t,' replied
the Curate; 'you mu&s;t not marry him then.'
It was in vain: the good-natured Eccle&s;ia&s;tic,
to get rid of her importunities, always agreed
<PB N="460" REF="479">
with her &s;entiments. He ob&s;erved her incli|nations
for the apprentice; and, at length, he
found this expedient to terminate her objec|tions.
'Go, Madam, and take advice of the
Bells of the Steeple: when they ring, they
will tell you what you &s;hould do.' When the
bells rung, the widow attentively li&s;tened; and,
according to her wi&s;hes, &s;he heard di&s;tinctly,
'<HI>Prens ton valet, prens ton valet!</HI>' Upon
the&s;e &s;trong arguments, in favour of the young
man, &s;he married him. Scarce had the honey|moon
clo&s;ed, when &s;he received very cruel
treatment from her late apprentice; and &s;he
who was mi&s;tre&s;s, now became a &s;ervant. She
went to complain to the good-natured Curate
of the advice he gave her; cur&s;ing the apocry|phal
Bells of the Church, and her fond cre|dulity.
He told her, that &s;he had mi&s;under|&s;tood
the Bells&mdash;'Ob&s;erve them next time.'
The widow again li&s;tened; and very clearly
di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;ounds of '<HI>Ne le prens pas,
ne le prens pas!</HI>' For the blows and the cruel
<PB N="461" REF="480">
treatment which &s;he had received had di&s;&s;i|pated
her pa&s;&s;ion; and the truth is, that all
the advice of the Bells con&s;i&s;ted in her own

<HEAD>THE THREE RACANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent anecdote, to it's merit as an hu|morous
deception, may add that of being a fact.</P>
<P>When Mademoi&s;elle De Gournay arrived at
Paris, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee the Marquis of Racan,
an eminent wit and poet. Two of Racan's
friends knew the time they had appointed for
his waiting on her; and they re&s;olved to be
revenged on Racan for many a ridiculous &s;itu|ation
to which he had expo&s;ed them. One of
the&s;e gentlemen, about two hours before the
time appointed, waited on Mademoi&s;elle De
Gournay, and announced him&s;elf as Racan.
He endeavoured to talk with the lady about
<PB N="462" REF="481">
her own works, which he had purpo&s;ely turned
over the night before; and, though he did not
perfectly &s;atisfy Mademoi&s;elle De Gournay in
point of his abilities, be&s;ides committing &s;ome
gro&s;s blunders, &s;he could not, however, but
think the Marquis was a very polite gentle|man.
He had &s;carce parted from her, when
another Marquis De Racan was announced.
She naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that it was the fir&s;t,
who had forgotten to &s;ay &s;omething to her,
and returned for this purpo&s;e; when, to her
great &s;urprize, another &s;tranger entered. She
could not help que&s;tioning him repeatedly if
he was the real Marquis De Racan; and in|formed
him of what had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. The pre|tended
Racan appeared very much hurt; and
declared, that he would be revenged of the
in&s;ult the &s;tranger had mutually offered them.
But, to cut the matter &s;hort, Mademoi&s;elle De
Gournay &s;oftened the choleric man; and was
infinitely plea&s;ed with the &s;econd Marquis De
Racan, who exceeded the fir&s;t in every re&s;pect.
<PB N="463" REF="482">
Scarce had this &s;econd counterfeit Racan i&s;&s;ued,
when the <HI>real Racan</HI> was announced! This
began to exerci&s;e the patience of Mademoi&s;elle
De Gournay. 'What, more Racans in one
morning!' &s;he exclaimed. However, &s;he re|&s;olved
to &s;ee the third. As &s;oon as he entered,
&s;he rai&s;ed her voice, and a&s;ked him if he meant
to in&s;ult her? Racan, who, at the be&s;t, was but
an indifferent &s;peaker, remained &s;ilent with
a&s;toni&s;hment. He muttered &s;omething; and
Mademoi&s;elle de Gournay, who was naturally
violent and ira&s;cible, imagined that he was &s;ent
to impo&s;e upon her. She pulled off her &s;lip|per,
and fell upon the real and unfortunate
Racan with the rage of an irritated virago, and
made him gladly retreat from a vi&s;it where he
had expected to meet with a very different re|ception.</P>

<HEAD>THE PORRIDGE-POT OF THE CORDELIERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few at Paris who know why
they &s;peak &s;o much concerning the great Por|ridge-Pot
of the Cordeliers of the great Con|vent.
It is, in fact, a &s;ingular piece: it can
contain from five to &s;ix hundred pounds of
meat, and near two tuns of water; &s;o that it is
no trifling occupation with tho&s;e good Fathers
to make a &s;oup. This deep Pot, broad and
high in proportion to it's depth, does not admit
of any thing being put in or drawn out with|out
a&s;cending a ladder. A gluttonous Cor|delier
always took the opportunity, when the
cooks were gone to church, to repair there, and
&s;teal &s;ome delicious bit from this enormous
Pot. He drew it up with an iron fork, and
conveyed it to his cell, to regale him&s;elf, with
two or three others of his comrades who had
the &s;ecret of conveying wine from the cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="487">
This Monk having one day mounted the
ladder, to draw, as u&s;ual, &s;ome delicate mor&s;el
from the Pot, which then happened to be not
more than two-thirds full, he was obliged to
&s;tretch him&s;elf to an unu&s;ual degree; and
the fork, by the ponderous weight of the piece
he had greedily &s;tuck it into, &s;lipped from his

overturned by his own weight and eagerne&s;s,
he tumbled into the Pot, and was &s;oon &s;uffo|cated,
without any power of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the
boiling lake of broth. A few hours after|wards,
the cooks came to &s;erve the refectory.
All the broth was emptied, the ba&s;ons were
filled, and brought to their u&s;ual places for the
u&s;e of the religioni&s;ts. They then returned, to
bring the meat from the Pot; but how great
was their &s;urprize, when, on a&s;cending the
ladder, the fir&s;t piece that pre&s;ented it&s;elf was

to his bed. They then gave out that he died

<P>A LITTLE work, publi&s;hed after that fa|mous

us with a humorous contra&s;t of their manners,
di&s;po&s;itions, habits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>' A Frenchman,' &s;ays our Author, 'enter|ing
his friend's hou&s;e, will immediately a&s;k
for &s;ome refre&s;hment: a Spaniard would rather
peri&s;h with hunger or thir&s;t. A Frenchman
&s;alutes a lady by ki&s;&s;ing her: a Spaniard, on
pre&s;enting a lady his hand, will cover it with
his cloak, and retreat back &s;everal paces to bow
to her at a hundred &s;teps di&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="491">
' I have often been tempted,' &s;ays the Au|thor,
who was a Spaniard, 'to a&s;k the mid|wives
if it was po&s;&s;ible that a French child
could be brought into the world in the &s;ame
manner as a Spani&s;h infant&mdash;&s;o di&s;&s;imilar they
prove from their birth!</P>
<P>' The French have a lively apprehen&s;ion,
hating idlene&s;s, and reducing their knowledge
into practical u&s;e; but they do not penetrate
deeply into any matter. The Spaniard, on the
contrary, is fond of ab&s;tract and ab&s;tru&s;e &s;pe|culation,
and dwells continually on an object.
The French are afraid of believing too much;
the other, of believing too little. The former
will di&s;patch the weightie&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in the mid&s;t
of noi&s;e and tumult, amid&s;t the levity of a&s;|&s;emblies,
or gaieties of the table; whil&s;t the
grave Spaniard cannot bear the buzzing of a
fly to di&s;turb his fixed attention. In love, the
one are light and talkative; the other, con&s;tant
and &s;ecret. The Spaniard will di&s;gui&s;e his po|verty
under a thou&s;and pretences, and invent
<PB N="473" REF="492">
as many fictions to per&s;uade you his appearance
is owing to the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing his per|&s;on;
whil&s;t the Frenchman will pre&s;s his wants
upon you with the mo&s;t per&s;evering impor|tunity.
In every minutia, this difference
is traced; both at the toilette and table:
in mixing wine, the Spaniard puts the water
fir&s;t in the gla&s;s; whil&s;t the Frenchman puts
the wine fir&s;t. A troop of Frenchmen will
walk abrea&s;t in the &s;treet with abundance of
tattle; whil&s;t the Spaniards will walk with
mea&s;ured gravity, in a defile, like a pro|ce&s;&s;ion.
A Frenchman, di&s;covering a per&s;on
at a di&s;tance, beckons with an uplifted hand,
drawn towards his face: the Spaniard bends
his hands downwards, and moves it towards

<HEAD>ANIMALS IMITATE LANGUAGE AND
ACTION.</HEAD>
<P>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, in his Memoirs,
relates a &s;tory concerning an old Parrot, be|longing
to the Prince Maurice, that readily
an&s;wered to &s;everal que&s;tions promi&s;cuou&s;ly
put to it. However &s;ingular the fact may ap|pear,
he a&s;&s;ures us it was told him as &s;uch by
the Prince him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Scaliger tells us, that he &s;aw a Crow, in the
French King's court, that was taught to fly at
Partridges, or any other fowl, from the fal|coner's
hand.</P>
<P>Cardinal A&s;&s;anio had a Parrot that was
taught to repeat the Apo&s;tles Creed, verbatim,
in Latin; and in the court of Spain there was
one that could &s;ing the Gamut perfectly.</P>
<P>In the Roman Hi&s;tory an anecdote is re|corded,
the truth of which we have no rea&s;on
<PB N="475" REF="494">
to doubt. When the &s;overeignty of the world
was depending between Cae&s;ar and Antony, a
poor man at Rome bred up two Crows; and
taught them to pronounce, in their prattling
language, a &s;alutation to the Emperor: and,
that he might be provided again&s;t all events,
one of them &s;aluted Cae&s;ar, and the other An|tony.
When Augu&s;tus was returning as the
conqueror, this man, with the Crow on his
hand, met him; and it was an ingenious and
agreeable flattery, to which Augu&s;tus was not
in&s;en&s;ible, to be &s;aluted by a Crow with the
acclamations of victory. He rewarded the
novel adulator munificently. The neighbour
of the man, however, having in vain e&s;&s;ayed
to teach the &s;ame language to two Crows he
had de&s;tined for this purpo&s;e, &s;tung with
envy at his happier fate, revealed to Augu&s;tus
that this man had another Crow at his hou&s;e,
which he had intended to have &s;aluted Antony,
had Fortune favoured his party. This mali|cious
<PB N="476" REF="495">
intelligence intercepted the bounty of
Augu&s;tus.</P>
<P>Perhaps, nothing appears more wonderful
than the &s;ight of an unwieldy Elephant danc|ing.
The manner of teaching this grave ani|mal
&s;o ludicrous an action is thus cruelly prac|ti&s;ed&mdash;They bring a <HI>young Elephant</HI> upon an iron
floor heated underneath; and play on a mu&s;ical
in&s;trument, while he lifts up his legs, and &s;hifts
his feet about, by rea&s;on of the torture of the
heat. This, frequently repeated, occa&s;ions him
to dance at the lea&s;t &s;ound of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>But let us not &s;uppo&s;e, that animals that
thus imitate the actions and language of Ra|tional
Creatures, po&s;&s;e&s;s, therefore, in &s;ome de|gree,
rationality and mental intelligence: for
when an Elephant, for in&s;tance, dances to
mu&s;ic, it is not from any principles of rea&s;on,
but from the concatenation of the two ideas of
<HI>heat</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ic,</HI> to which cu&s;tom has habituated
him. So a Parrot may an&s;wer any que&s;tion it
is accu&s;tomed to hear; but this action needs
<PB N="477" REF="496">
not the aid of rea&s;on, &s;ince it may be effected
by <HI>an habitual idea</HI> of things. Even the in|ferior
ranks of animals receive their <HI>ideas</HI> by
the <HI>&s;en&s;es.</HI> Such and &s;uch &s;ounds often re|peated,
and &s;uch and &s;uch actions immediately
preceding or immediately following tho&s;e
&s;ounds, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily form a <HI>complex idea</HI>
both of the &s;ound and action; &s;o that, when
either &s;uch action or &s;uch &s;ound is repeated, an
idea of the other mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend it.
Thus Dogs are taught to fetch and carry; and
Parrots &s;peak more words than one together.
The&s;e words, <HI>Poor Poll!</HI> for in&s;tance, being
often repeated together, if one be mentioned,
and the other left, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an
idea of the other &s;ound, becau&s;e cu&s;tom and
habit link them together. As two words are
taught, &s;o may three; and, if three, why not
many? It is thus, by a <HI>complex idea,</HI> the Ele|phant
dances; for, when he hears mu&s;ic, the
idea of the heated floor occa&s;ions him to
dance.</P>

according to Aurelius Victor, and Diodorus,
Saturn &s;oftened the wicked inclinations of

their ancient purity of manners, by a civilized
and regulated life.</P>
<P>Between the Deluge and the birth of Phaleg
there was an interval of one hundred years;

<HEAD>THE LATIN TONGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fate of the Latin Tongue may be di|vided
into &s;ix Ages. The Barbarous and Un|cultivated
Age; the Middle Age; the Golden,
the Silver, the Bra&s;s, and the Iron Ages.</P>
<P>The Barbarous Age la&s;ted from four to five
hundred years; from Romulus, in who&s;e reign
<PB N="489" REF="508">
more Greek than Latin was &s;poken, till Li|vius
Andronicus, the fir&s;t who cau&s;ed Plays to
be acted at Rome.</P>
<P>The Middle Age extends it&s;elf from An|dronicus
till the days of Cicero. During this
interval of time, many Authors began to write
the Latin Language. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed
are, Ennius, Naevius, Plautus, Terence, and
Lucretius. The Poem of the la&s;t writer does
&s;o much honour to this Age, that we mu&s;t
candidly acknowledge, it would not be unwor|thy,
even of the Golden Age of pure Latinity,
were it &s;omewhat le&s;s ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>The Golden Age of the Latin Language be|gan
in the reign of Circero, and fini&s;hed
with the reign of Augu&s;tus; &s;o that, without a
metaphor, it is but an Age. Then flouri&s;h|ed
Varro, Cicero, Julius Cae&s;ar, Cornelius
Nepos, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Severus Albi|novanus,
Sallu&s;t, and others; a part of who&s;e

Time.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="509">
The Silver Age, which commences at the
death of Augu&s;tus, and terminates with An|tonine
the Pious, was very fruitful in excel|lent

Seneca, who&s;e &s;tyle is one continued affecta|tion,

points, antithe&s;is, and other trivial &s;ports of

&s;hocks a correct ta&s;te. It was him who cor|rupted
the Latin Language.</P>
<P>The Age of Bra&s;s commences from the reign

took place. Be&s;ides profane Authors, who

<P>I HAVE extracted from two Authors of a

<P>Peter Heylin thus ob&s;erves in his Co&s;mo|graphy&mdash;'The Engli&s;h Language is a de|compound
of Dutch, French, and Latin,
which I conceive rather to add to it's perfec|tion,
<PB N="493" REF="512">
than to detract any thing from the worth
thereof, &s;ince out of every Language we have
culled the mo&s;t &s;ignificant words, and equally
participate in that which is excellent in them:
their imperfections being rejected; for it is
neither &s;o boi&s;terous as <HI>the Dutch,</HI> nor &s;o ef|feminate
as <HI>the French,</HI> yet as &s;ignificant as <HI>the
Latin</HI>; and, in the happy conjunction of two
words into one, little inferior of <HI>the Greek.</HI>'</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan thus ingeniou&s;ly has written
on the &s;ame topic&mdash;'Upon a fair compari&s;on,
it will appear that <HI>the French</HI> have ema&s;culated
their Tongue, by rejecting &s;uch numbers of
their con&s;onants; and made it re&s;emble one of
their painted <HI>Courtezans,</HI> adorned with frip|peries
and fallals. That <HI>the German,</HI> by a|bounding
too much in har&s;h Con&s;onants and
Gutturals, has great &s;ize and &s;trength, like the
&s;tatue of <HI>Hercules Farne&s;e,</HI> but no grace. That
<HI>the Roman,</HI> like the bu&s;t of <HI>Antinous,</HI> is beau|tiful
indeed, but not manly. That <HI>the Italian</HI>
has beauty, grace, and &s;ymmetry, like the <HI>Ve|nus</HI>
<PB N="494" REF="513">
of Medicis, but is feminine; and that <HI>the
Engli&s;h</HI> alone re&s;embles the ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> in
uniting the three powers, of &s;trength, beauty,
and grace, like <HI>the Apollo of Belvedere.</HI>'</P>
<P>I contemplate with great plea&s;ure the cla&s;|&s;ical
&s;tatue which is here offered to the imagi|nation.
When I recollect the &s;weetne&s;s of
<HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> the &s;trength of <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and the grace
of <HI>Melmoth,</HI> I ri&s;e into enthu&s;ia&s;m, and exult in
the conviction that <HI>the Engli&s;h</HI> is the mo&s;t per|fect
of the European Languages. The em|barra&s;&s;ed
periods of Hooker, Raleigh, and
Clarendon, will no more langui&s;h on the ear.
We have poli&s;hed the &s;olid marble of our

no preten&s;ions, they have extracted it from
the quarry; but we are the artificers who, with
the dexterous u&s;e of the file, can &s;mooth their
a&s;perities, can arrange into elegance, and can
heighten into lu&s;tre. No more &s;hall &s;ome fu|ture
<HI>Waller</HI> &s;ing, that he who employs the

<PB N="495" REF="514">
and that, to endure to po&s;terity, he mu&s;t carve
in the <HI>marble</HI> of Latin and Greek.</P>
<P>The Golden Age of the Engli&s;h Language,
however, &s;eems approaching to it's fir&s;t &s;tate.
Nothing contributes &s;o much to corrupt it's
purity as an inundation of Frech tran&s;lations,
rather than tran&s;lations from the French. The
avarice of &s;ome, and the hunger of others, are
continually pouring on us whole volumes, di&s;|figured
with Gallici&s;ms; and, not infrequently,
whole &s;entences in French are aukwardly in|troduced
as improvements, doubtle&s;s, to &s;up|ply
the deficiences of Engli&s;h Language, or
rather tho&s;e of the Tran&s;lator.</P>
<P>Yet, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there are &s;ome few
<HI>French words</HI> which, with great felicity, ex|pre&s;s
a &s;en&s;e of which we have no exact or

u&s;e of phra&s;es which may &s;erve tolerably well

<P>The ingenious Vigneul Marville has ven|tured

was no competent judge of it's demerits; at
lea&s;t, his critici&s;m is too often more &s;prightly

now a century &s;ince he flouri&s;hed; and, if we
reflect on the &s;tate of our Language in his day,
it will not be found totally unju&s;t.</P>
<P>' The &s;tyle of the Engli&s;h writers is long
and embarra&s;&s;ed, very difficult to tran&s;late into
Latin, into French, or into Italian. We mu&s;t
recollect this when we read the works of the
Engli&s;h Authors in their own language with
an intention to tran&s;late them. Perhaps, the
Engli&s;h would bear better to be tran&s;lated into
Spani&s;h than into French, as the French is
more happily rendered into Greek than into
Latin. The Italian will find no language which,
without injuring it's delicacies and it's dimi|nutives,
can afford a ver&s;ion. The German
Language is well enough adapted to the

<HEAD>THE HEBREW.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST all tho&s;e writers who have treated

us, that it is the fir&s;t that men have
&s;poken: but&mdash;what is more impertinent in
them&mdash;they have the a&s;&s;urance to inform us
that it is the Language of God him&s;elf; nor
is this opinion by any means novel, &s;ince Saint
Gregory of Ny&s;&s;a has, even in his life-time,
reprobated the idea, and calls it a folly, and a
ridiculous vanity of the Jews; as if God him|&s;elf,
he &s;ays, had been a ma&s;ter of Grammar.
La Motte le Vayer writes in his Letters, that
the mo&s;t partial partizans which ever the
Hebrew has had, mu&s;t confe&s;s, that excepting
the inferior Languages, &s;uch as the Ba&s;k and
the Breton, &amp;c. there is not among the living
or the dead Languages, any which do not
pre&s;ent us with more valuable compo&s;itions
than the Hebrew does, if we except the Old
Te&s;tament. He adds, that he can well do
without making u&s;e of a barbarous jargon that
never repays us for the laceration which it oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="510" REF="529">
to our throats in pronouncing it's gut|tural
letters.</P>
<P>The Hebrew Grammars which the Chri&s;|tians
have compo&s;ed, are infinitely more perfect
than tho&s;e of the Jews. Their knowledge in
the writings of their Rabbins is not inferior;
and to this they have added a clear and regu|lar
method, which is very nece&s;&s;ary in a Lan|guage
who&s;e idioms and modes of expre&s;&s;ion
the great di&s;tance of time has &s;o ob&s;cured,
that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to attain to any

<P>Buxtorf, the father, has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e

Ludolphus has given us a Grammar of the

<HEAD>ON THE USE OF THE PAGAN MYTHOLOGY
IN POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>A REVOLUTION has taken place in modern
Poetry, which is of the greate&s;t importance to
<PB N="514" REF="533">
the lovers of the art. This is no le&s;s than a
total bani&s;hment of the Heathen Mythology
from our Poetry. The great <HI>John&s;on</HI> prefer|ring,
not infrequently, a &s;ingularity of opinion
to an enforcing of truth&mdash;or, let us confe&s;s,
who has given &s;trong marks of a deficiency in
poetical ta&s;te&mdash;has confounded the beauties of
the Pagan Mythology with it's abu&s;e. We
are to read the critici&s;ms of this great man
with caution; we mu&s;t recollect that, in his
examination of <HI>Milton,</HI> his prejudices warp
his judgment; and, in his animadver&s;ions on
<HI>Gray,</HI> his critici&s;ms were uncandid and unpo|etical.
He tells us, in his Life of <HI>Prior,</HI>
'That his fictions are Mythological, and that
they are &s;urely de&s;picable:' for he adds&mdash;'By
the help of &s;uch ea&s;y fictions, and vulgar
topics, without acquaintance with life, and
without knowledge of art or nature, a poem
of any length, cold and lifele&s;s like this, may
be ea&s;ily written on any &s;ubject.'</P>
<P>This is dictated by the uncharitable &s;pirit of
<PB N="515" REF="534">
critici&s;m. It is &s;trange, that a man of &s;uch
active faculties, and of &s;uch critical &s;agacity,
&s;hould not have perceived, that when the Poet
wanders in the unbounded regions of Fancy,
he hath little to do with the mere &s;tate of
Nature; that, expatiating in the wide range
of Imagination, he does not &s;o much <HI>borrow</HI>
from Nature, but rather <HI>adorns</HI> her by the
creation of new beings. Hence the pipe of
the &s;hepherd is the <HI>&s;hrill &s;hell of Pan</HI>; the mur|muring
of the waters is <HI>the &s;igh of the Naiad</HI>;
and the dewy flowers, that &s;parkle on the eye,
are the <HI>glittering tears of Aurora.</HI></P>
<P>I will allow that a Pedant, well-read in his
Pantheon, may produce, what &s;ome may be
apt to take for a Poem, by a mere mechanical
effort. He may call Apollo and the Mu&s;es,
Minerva and Venus; but let him beware of
what he is about. The&s;e cele&s;tial beings are
no le&s;s dangerous than what, in our Briti&s;h
Solomon's time, was thought to be the rai&s;ing
of the devil; of whom one &s;aid, that he doubt|ed
<PB N="516" REF="535">
not, with book in hand, he could rai&s;e him
ea&s;ily enough; but, when he had done that,
the danger lay in the manner he was to em|ploy
his devil&s;hip. The Pedant may, indeed,
lug into his ver&s;e the reluctant Gods and
Gode&s;&s;es; but they will not have the air of
divinities. It requires the mo&s;t &s;kilful hand,
and &s;ome of the fine&s;t touches of genius, to
place them in a novel &s;ituation; to poli&s;h the
fini&s;hed piece into cla&s;&s;ical beauty, and exhau&s;t
on them the pomp and brilliancy of his ima|gination.</P>
<P>Let us not, then, ha&s;tily re&s;ign our faith, in
the theology of ancient Poetry. If it appears
trite and in&s;ipid in the hands of a mere ver&s;i|fier,
let us reflect, that every thing in &s;uch a
writer will have the &s;ame effect. It is cer|tain,
that no order of beings have yet been
found &s;o agreeable to the imagination, when
this poetic machinery is di&s;played by the ad|dre&s;s
of &s;uperior genius. How admirably has
<HI>Gray,</HI> in his Progre&s;s of Poetry, embelli&s;hed
<PB N="517" REF="536">
with the&s;e beautiful forms the third &s;tanza of
the fir&s;t Anti&s;trophy. Allegorical Per&s;onages,
which <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> has unfortunately employed,
&s;oon weary. The enchantment of mytholo|gical
fiction is continued, and is &s;u&s;ceptible of
continual variety.</P>
<P>The omnipotence of the divinities of Poetry
is eternal: it is true, they do not always yield
their in&s;piration. Venus &s;till re&s;ides in Pa|phos;
Diana &s;till embelli&s;hes the woods; the
Nymphs inhabit their accu&s;tomed oak; and
there is not a pure &s;tream but, in it's cry&s;taline
cave, is &s;till honoured with the pre&s;ence of it's
Naiad.</P>
<P>I venerate the abilities of this our late <HI>Cory|phaeus</HI>;
but, if we are blindly to follow the
<HI>dictum</HI> of our leader, farewel to that free di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
by which, through the medium of con|trary
opinions, we at length attain to truth. The
critical powers of <HI>Boileau</HI> may well be oppo&s;ed
to tho&s;e of <HI>John&s;on</HI>; and however the Engli&s;h
<PB N="518" REF="537">
dre&s;s, which Sir <HI>William Soame</HI> has given him,
may be inferior to the original <HI>Boileau,</HI> he may
yet be under&s;tood.</P>
<Q><L>IN the narration of &s;ome great de&s;ign,</L>
<L>Invention, art, and fable, all mu&s;t join:</L>
<L>Here <HI>fiction</HI> mu&s;t employ it's utmo&s;t grace;</L>
<L>All mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume a body, mind, and face.</L>
<L>Each <HI>virtue a divinity</HI> is &s;een;</L>

<L><HI>Echo's</HI> no more an empty, airy &s;ound,</L>
<L>But a <HI>fair nymph,</HI> that weeps her lover drown'd.</L>
<L>Thus, in the endle&s;s trea&s;ures of his mind,</L>
<L>The Poet does a thou&s;and figures find:</L>
<L>Around the work his ornaments he pours,</L><L>* * * * * * *</L>
<L>Without the&s;e ornaments before our eyes,</L>
<L>Th' un&s;inewed poem langui&s;hes and dies:</L>
<L>Your Poet in his art will always fail,</L>
<L>And tell you but a dull, in&s;ipid tale.</L>
<L>In vain have our mi&s;taken Authors try'd</L>

<HEAD>ON THE POETRY OF BARON HALLER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was once the intention of the Editor to have
pre&s;ented a tran&s;lation of the Poetry of Baron
Haller to the public.</P>
<P>The Poet, whom I am now going to intro|duce
to the reader, is better known in this
country for his exten&s;ive learning and recon|dite
labours in phy&s;iology, than for tho&s;e ex|qui&s;ite
pieces which place him &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly
among&s;t the modern Poets of Germany.</P>
<P>If England hath not be&s;towed on him the
honours of a Poet, France, however, hath
not been backward in this re&s;pect. His Poetry
hath been elegantly tran&s;lated, and multiplied
by repeated editions. There are tho&s;e who
have placed him on an equality with the cele|brated
Ge&s;ner: and, perhaps, he is only not
equal to him in not having produced a Poem
of the magnitude of his Death of Abel.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="542">
If it is allowed me to give the character of
Haller as a Poet, I will &s;ay, that he does not
&s;well into that turgid eloquence, which wea|ries
the mental eye by a cumbrous accumula|tion
of &s;plendour. It is the characteri&s;tic of
the German Poets, that they do not know
when to &s;top; the &s;trength of their genius
tran&s;ports them into ob&s;curity: by &s;oaring too
high, they &s;train the temperate eye of the
Critics; judgment to them is a &s;ilken &s;tring,
too feeble to chain the wing of an eagle.</P>
<P>I do not mean, however, to countenance or
excu&s;e certain pieces which, they inform us,
are tran&s;lations from the German; and which,
indeed, may well di&s;gu&s;t the world with all
German Poetry. But, I believe that the bom|ba&s;t
of the&s;e writers is rather to be attributed
to them&s;elves, than to the unfortunate Ger|man;
who, certainly, had he originally writ|ten
in &s;o aukward a &s;tyle, would not have been
thought worthy of a tran&s;lation.</P>
<P><PB N="524" REF="543">
Haller is beautiful in his de&s;criptions, &s;ub|lime
in his Odes, and tender in his elegies.
He is not le&s;s to be admired as a Satiri&s;t; and
Berne once trembled at the pre&s;ence of it's Ju|venal.
His numbers are highly poli&s;hed; and
it is hard to render ju&s;tice to the delicate lan|guage
of his Mu&s;e.</P>
<P>The following Poem is not partially cho&s;en,
but for it's convenient length. There is an
elegant &s;implicity, added to a clo&s;ene&s;s of
thought; which, if it does not always wear
the fanta&s;tic air of novelty, impre&s;&s;es in the
feeling heart that philo&s;ophical con&s;olation
worthy of the genius of Haller.</P>
