<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I PRESENT the Reader with an im|perfect
attempt on an important
topic. The materials de&s;igned for
this E&s;&s;ay, with others, have been
accidentally de&s;troyed. The fol|lowing
&s;ketches are therefore not &s;o
numerous as I could wi&s;h, and as
the &s;ubject appears to promi&s;e. They
claim all the indulgence of the title.</P>
<P>I have long con&s;idered, what I ima|gine
will be readily acknowledged,
that there is a &s;imilarity in the cha|racters
of Men of Genius, perceivable
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to a contemplative mind, and that
reflections on their character may be
exemplified by a &s;ufficient number
of facts. To &s;ei&s;e the di&s;po&s;itions
of the Literary Character, I looked
therefore into Literary Hi&s;tory, and
my collections exceeded my hopes.</P>
<P>When Rou&s;&s;eau compo&s;ed his Di&s;|&s;ertation
on the Equality of Man,
this eloquent philo&s;opher &s;ought for
<HI>facts,</HI> on which to found his rea&s;on|ings;
the&s;e he collected from an
exten&s;ive peru&s;al of voyages and ac|counts
of remote nations. I con&s;i|dered
that to form ju&s;t reflections on
Men of Genius, it was proper to
collect facts from their biography,
and their concatenation produced all
my reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
The more I meditate, the more I
am per&s;uaded that all &s;peculations
are illu&s;ory and un&s;atisfactory, unle&s;s
they are e&s;tabli&s;hed on prominent
facts, which are to be fir&s;t collected
before we venture to indulge meta|phy&s;ical
di&s;qui&s;itions. It is an ob|&s;ervation
of Bolingbroke, that <Q REND="inline">ab|&s;tract
or general propo&s;itions,
though never &s;o true, appear ob|&s;cure
or doubtful to us very often,
till they are explained by <HI>exam|ples</HI>&mdash;when
examples are pointed
out to us, there is a kind of appeal,
with which we are flattered, made
to our &s;en&s;es, as well as our un|der&s;tandings.
The in&s;truction
comes then from our authority;
<HI>we yield to fact, when we re&s;i&s;t
&s;peculation.</HI></Q> If we compare the
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
labours of Machiavel with tho&s;e of
Monte&s;quieu, we may ob&s;erve, that
the illu&s;trious Frenchman had all the
delicacy, the refinement, and the
&s;en&s;ibility of his nation, and his gene|ral
reflections are therefore brilliant,
but often fallacious, becau&s;e not built
on the permanent ba&s;e of experience.
The crafty Florentine, ver&s;ant in the
manners of Princes, with &s;agacity
equal to his genius, deduces all his
reflections from tho&s;e prominent
<HI>facts</HI> which pa&s;&s;ed under his eye, or
which he collected from the records
of in&s;tructive hi&s;tory. Lord Bacon
introduced that wi&s;e philo&s;ophy
which is only founded on <HI>experi|ments</HI>;
the &s;tudy of Nature in her
operations. And I believe every ju|dicious
phy&s;ician prefers the manner
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
of Sydenham, who derives his medical
fame from the vigilant ob&s;ervation,
and the continued experience of
tracing the progre&s;s of actual ca&s;es,
in the operation of actual remedies,
to that of &s;ome modern medical
writers, who, dazzled by &s;pecula|tive
phantoms, promulge paradoxes,
which, unconfirmed by facts, produce
much more &s;erious con&s;equence than
literary paradoxes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Readers of "A Di&s;&s;ertation on Anecdotes" will plea&s;e to accept the&s;e ob&s;ervations, as a final &s;upplement to that tract.</NOTE></P>
<P>The LITERARY CHARACTER
has, in the pre&s;ent day, &s;ingularly
degenerated in the public mind. The
fine&s;t compo&s;itions appear with|out
exciting any alarm of admiration,
they are read, approved, and &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
by others; nor is the pre&s;ence
of the Author con&s;idered, as for|merly,
as conferring honour on his
companions; we pa&s;s our evenings
&s;ometimes with poets and hi&s;torians,
whom it is probable will be admired
by po&s;terity, with hardly any other
&s;en&s;ation than we feel from inferior
a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>The youth who has more reading
than experience, and a finer imagi|nation
than a &s;ound logic, will often
be &s;urpri&s;ed when he compares the
&s;plendid facts &s;tored in his memory,
with the ordinary circum&s;tances that
pa&s;s under his eye. In the hi&s;tory of
all ages, and of all nations, he ob|&s;erves
the highe&s;t honours paid to
the Literary Character. Statues,
tombs, fe&s;tivals, and coronations,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
croud in glittering confu&s;ion, while,
when he conde&s;cends to look around
him, he perceives the brilliant en|chantment
di&s;&s;olved, and not a ve&s;|tige
remains of the fe&s;tivals and the
coronations.</P>
<P>Before I attempt to alledge a rea&s;on
for a &s;ingular revolution in the human
mind, I &s;hall arrange a few &s;triking
facts of the numerous honours which
have been paid to the Literary Cha|racter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not dwell on the di&s;tinc|tions
be&s;towed on the learned by the
Greeks and the Romans; their tem|ples,
their &s;tatues, their games, and
fleets di&s;patched to invite the Stu|dent;
the&s;e honours were more
numerous and &s;plendid than tho&s;e of
modern ages. I mu&s;t not detail the
<PB N="x" REF="9">
magnificent rewards and the high
veneration paid by the Per&s;ians, the
Turks, the Arabians, the Chine&s;e,
&amp;c. The Per&s;ian Ferdo&s;i received
&s;acks of gold for his ver&s;es; the
Arabs have &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to con|gratulate
poets on the &s;ucce&s;s of their
works; Mahomet took off his man|tle
to pre&s;ent to an Author; and
literature in China confers nobility.
But I pa&s;s this romantic celebrity, to
throw a rapid glance on our own
Europe.</P>
<P>Not to commence more remotely
than at the thirteenth century,
when Nobles, and even Kings, a&s;pi|red
to literature. Authors, of cour&s;e,
were held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation.
Fauchet and Pa&s;quier inform us, that
the learned received magnificent
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
dre&s;&s;es, &s;teeds richly capari&s;oned,
and arms re&s;plendent with diamonds
and gold. The Floral games at
Toulou&s;e were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and three
prizes of golden flowers were re|&s;erved
for the happy poets. It was
in the fourteenth century that the Ita|lians
rai&s;ed triumphal arches, tombs,
and coronations, for di&s;tingui&s;hed
Authors. Ravenna erected a marble
tomb to the memory of Dante; Cer|taldo
a &s;tatue to Boccaccio, and Pe|trarch
was at once invited by the city
of Rome and the court of France, to
receive the crown of laurel. Rome
was preferred, and there he was pub|lickly
crowned with &s;uch magnifi|cence
of pomp, and ceremonies &s;o
&s;plendid and numerous, that his own
imagination could not have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
the realities of this triumph.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I lament much that Dr. Burney, who&s;e learning excels my prai&s;e, and who&s;e elegance is not inferior to his learning, has treated this &s;ubject with great levity. He &s;ays, in his valuable Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic, vol. 2. p. 332, that this was a cen&s;ureable vanity&mdash;and that <Q REND="inline">the blame can only be laid on his <HI>youth,</HI> or rather on <HI>the practice of the times.</HI></Q> And he continues in a &s;train of ridicule to cen&s;ure the&s;e te&s;ti|monies of national &s;en&s;ibility. But I ob&s;erve, that the learned Doctor, while he &s;miles at this popular di&s;play and vanity, has prefixed to his performance <HI>his own portrait</HI> in (what &s;ome may con&s;ider) <HI>the af|fected po&s;ture</HI> of <HI>beating time,</HI> painted by Reynolds, and engraved by Bartolozzi. The Doctor makes an animated appearance; but this <HI>public exhibition</HI> of Burney, has not le&s;s vanity than that of Petrarch; mu&s;t not we apply to the Doctor his own words, and <Q REND="inline">lay the blame on his youth, or rather <HI>on the practice of the times?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The error of Dr. Burney, in this in&s;tance, pro|ceeds from his not confe&s;&s;ing that there was <HI>no va|nity</HI> in the coronation of Petrarch; for the love of glory is &s;omething very &s;uperior to vanity.</P></NOTE> Ta&s;&s;o
died the evening of his coronation.
In the fifteenth century, Sannazarius
received from the Venetians for &s;ix
ver&s;es, &s;ix hundred pi&s;toles, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
poets were ki&s;&s;ed by prince&s;&s;es. Later
times &s;aw the phlegmatic Hollander
rai&s;e a&s;tatue to the excellent Era&s;mus.
Let us not omit that Charles IX. of
France re&s;erved apartments in his
palace, and even wrote a poetical
epi&s;tle to Ron&s;ard; and Baif received
a &s;ilver image of Minerva from his
native city. Charles V. and Francis I.
in the &s;ixteenth century, poured
honours, preferments, and gifts, on
the learned of their age. Literary
merit was the road to promotion, and
&s;eignories and abbeys, &s;eats in the
&s;tate council, and amba&s;&s;ador&s;hips
were be&s;towed upon the Literary
Character.</P>
<P>Since all this is truth, yet at
pre&s;ent appears much like fiction, it
may be enquired if our ance&s;tors
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
were wi&s;er than we, or we more wi&s;e
than our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>It is to be recollected, that before
the art of printing exi&s;ted, great
Authors were like their works, very
rare; learning was then only ob|tained
by the devotion of a life. It
was long after the art of multiplying
works at plea&s;ure was di&s;covered,
that the people were capable of par|ticipating
in the novel benefit; what
Alexander feared, when he reproached
Ari&s;totle for rendering learning po|pular,
has happened to modern lite|rature;
learning and talents have
cea&s;ed to be learning and talents, by
an univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of books, and
a continued exerci&s;e of the mind.
Authors became numerous, but as
the body of the people, till within
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
the pre&s;ent century, was &s;ufficiently
unenlightened, their numbers were not
yet found inconvenient; and as dic|tionaries
were not yet formed, every
man was happy to &s;ei&s;e on whatever
particles of knowledge accident of|fered;
&s;o late as the middle of this
century, Tran&s;lators were yet e&s;|teemed,
and Compilers were yet re|&s;pected.</P>
<P>But &s;ince, with ince&s;&s;ant indu&s;try,
volumes have been multiplied, and
their prices rendered them acce&s;&s;ible
to the lowe&s;t arti&s;ans, the Literary
Character has gradually fallen into
di&s;repute. It may be urged that a
&s;uperior mind, long cultivated, and
long exerci&s;ed, adorned with polite,
and enriched with &s;olid letters, mu&s;t
&s;till retain it's pre-eminence among
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
the inferior ranks of men; and there|fore
may &s;till exact the &s;ame re&s;pect
from his fellow-citizens, and &s;till
continue the dignity of an Author
with the &s;ame ju&s;t claims as in pre|ceding
ages.</P>
<P>I believe, however, that he who
would be reverenced as an Author has
only one re&s;ource; and that is, by
paying to him&s;elf that reverence,
which will be refu&s;ed by the multi|tude.
The re&s;pect which the higher
cla&s;&s;es &s;hew to the Literary Character,
proceeds from habitual politene&s;s,
and not from any &s;en&s;ibility of ad|miration;
and that this is true, ap|pears
from this circum&s;tance, that,
&s;hould the Literary Character, in re|turn,
refu&s;e to accommodate him&s;elf
to their regulations, and have not the
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
art of di&s;covering what quality they
expect to be remarked in them&s;elves,
he will be &s;oon for&s;aken; and he
may &s;ay what Socrates did at the
court of Cyprus, <Q REND="inline">what I know is
not proper for this place, and
what is proper for this place, I
know not.</Q> Men of the world
are curious to have a glance at a
celebrated Author, as they would be
at &s;ome uncommon animal; he is
therefore &s;ometimes exhibited, and
&s;pectators are invited. A croud of
frivoli&s;ts gaze at a Man of Letters,
and catch the &s;ounds of his ideas, as
children regard the reflections of a
magic lanthorn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ob&s;ervation of the great Era&s;mus on Men of Letters, is not le&s;s ju&s;t than admirable. He &s;aid, that they were like the great figures in the tape&s;tries of Flanders, which lo&s;e their effect, when not &s;een at a di&s;tance.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17">
Nor will the Literary Character
find a happier reception among others
if he exacts an ob&s;ervance of his
dignity. Authors are a multitude;
and it requires no incon&s;iderable
lei&s;ure and intelligence to adju&s;t the
claims of &s;uch numerous candidates.</P>
<P>De Foe called the la&s;t age, the
age of Projectors, and John&s;on has
called the pre&s;ent, the age of Au|thors.
But there is this difference
between them; the epidemical folly
of projecting in time cures it&s;elf, for
men become weary with ruination;
but writing is an interminable pur|&s;uit,
and the raptures of publication
have a great chance of becoming a
permanent fa&s;hion. When I reflect
that every literary journal con&s;i&s;ts of
50 or 60 publications, and that of
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
the&s;e, 5 or 6 at lea&s;t are capital per|formances,
and the greater part not
contemptible, when I take the pen
and attempt to calculate, by the&s;e
given &s;ums, the number of volumes
which the next century mu&s;t infal|libly
produce, my feeble faculties
wander in a perplexed &s;eries, and
as I lo&s;e my&s;elf among billions, tril|lions,
and quartillions, I am obliged
to lay down my pen, and &s;top at in|finity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Where all this will end, God
only knows,</Q> is the reflection of
a grave hi&s;torian, in concluding the
Memoirs of his Age. Nature has,
no doubt, provided &s;ome concealed
remedy for this future univer&s;al de|luge.
Perhaps in the progre&s;s of
&s;cience, &s;ome new &s;en&s;es may be di&s;|covered
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
in the human character, and
this &s;uperfluity of knowledge may be
e&s;&s;ential to the under&s;tanding, We
are con&s;iderably indebted, doubtle&s;s,
to the patriotic endeavours of our
grocers and trunkmakers, whom I
re&s;pect as the alchemi&s;ts of literature;
they annihilate the gro&s;s bodies, with|out
injuring the finer &s;pirits.</P>
<P>We are, however, &s;incerely to la|ment
that the dignity of great Au|thors
is at all impaired. Every kind
of writers find a corre&s;pondent kind
of readers, and the illiterate have their
admirers, and are of &s;ome u&s;e. But it
is time that we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
Authors, and &s;ubmit our&s;elves
to re&s;pect tho&s;e, from whom we ac|quire
in&s;truction, and to cheri&s;h tho&s;e,
from whom we derive the mo&s;t ele|gant
of our amu&s;ements.</P>

<ITEM>IT is, perhaps, unnece&s;&s;ary to remind the
Reader that Cicero has written on Friend|&s;hip
and Glory&mdash;of his work on Glory, no|thing
has reached us but the title; yet of his
numerous compo&s;itions, this, as a production

Their piety was too ponderous for

of Clarke, and the logic of John&s;on, were
alike fatal to certain delicious &s;trokes in the

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Literary Men.</HEAD>
<P>A NUMEROUS and an important body
of men, diffu&s;ed over enlightened Eu|rope,
and cla&s;&s;ed under no particular
profe&s;&s;ion, are, during the mo&s;t arduous
period of their life, una&s;&s;i&s;ted and unre|garded;
and while often devoting them
&s;elves to national purpo&s;es, are expo&s;ed
not only to poverty, the fate of the many;
to calumny, the portion of the great;
but to an ugly family of peculiar misfor|tunes.
The&s;e are men of letters; men
who&s;e particular genius often becomes
<PB N="2" REF="24">
that of a people; the &s;overeigns of rea|&s;on;
the legi&s;lators of morality; the ar|tificers
of our mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Every other body of ingenious men
(whether the corporation of u&s;eful me|chanics,
or the &s;ociety of great arti&s;ts)
are allowed &s;ome common a&s;&s;ociation;
&s;ome dome&s;tic &s;eat devoted to the genius
of their profe&s;&s;ion, where they are mu|tually
enlightened and con&s;oled. Men
of letters, in our country re&s;emble
<Q>Hou&s;ele&s;s wanderers,</Q>
&s;cattered and &s;olitary, di&s;united and lan|guid;
who&s;e talents are frequently un|known
to their companions, and by the
inertne&s;s of an unhappy &s;ituation, often
unperceived by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that tho&s;e men in the
nation who are mo&s;t familiar with each
other's conceptions, and mo&s;t capable
of reciprocal e&s;teem, are tho&s;e who are
often mo&s;t e&s;tranged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Authors.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between
an Author, and a Writer; becau&s;e, the
de&s;criptions which I propo&s;e to &s;ketch
of the &s;ituations to which genius is fre|quently
expo&s;ed, will not happen to tho&s;e
who&s;e productions are their occa&s;ional
effu&s;ions; and who &s;eldom propo&s;e in
the puerile age, to become Authors. I
&s;hall con&s;ider that no Writer, has a ju&s;t
claim to the title of Author, who&s;e
CHIEF EMPLOYMENT is not that of STUDY
and COMPOSITION. Richard&s;on the no|veli&s;t,
and Ge&s;&s;ner the poet, were both
printers, and this will, occa&s;ionally, ex|clude
them from the idea I at pre&s;ent
attach to an author. Hume and Bayle,
John&s;on and Voltaire, are &s;tudents who
a&s;&s;umed the profe&s;&s;ion of authors. The

occa&s;ional productions of a man of genius

<P>I totally exclude from the&s;e &s;pecula|tions
two kinds of writers. Tho&s;e who
di&s;grace letters and humanity by an ab|ject

who&s;e vanity li&s;tens to a few encomia&s;ts
who&s;e politene&s;s is greater than their di&s;|cernment,
or who applaud loudly and
cen&s;ure in whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the character of an
author, we find that every cla&s;s of men
entertains a different notion of his occu|pations.
We perceive al&s;o that the lite|rary
<PB N="5" REF="27">
world are divided into parties; and
that they are mutually unju&s;t. Few are
capable of honouring this character; in|dividuals
err from various motives; the
public only are enlightened and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The importance of an author in &s;o|ciety,
is yet &s;o little known, that it is
rarely apparent even to authors them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hionable circle conceive an au|thor
mu&s;t be an amu&s;ing companion;
they con&s;ider his pre&s;ence, like the other
ornaments of their tables. It implies
that they are per&s;ons of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The bu&s;y part of mankind &s;uppo&s;e an
author to be a trader; and are only a&s;to|ni&s;hed
to ob&s;erve men per&s;evere in an
occupation &s;o unprofitable.</P>
<P>The &s;tate&s;man only regards a philo&s;o|phical
writer as a man of dangerous &s;pe|culations,
who, if left in &s;ecurity, is
daring, if attacked by per&s;ecution, is
<PB N="6" REF="28">
intrepid. One who makes him tremble
in the darkne&s;s of his mo&s;t &s;ecret coun|cils.</P>
<P>The man of &s;cience regards his pro|ductions
with contempt, and at the mo&s;t
favourable view only as &s;o many amu&s;ing
futilities. He marks his &s;uperior &s;ucce&s;s
with a jealous eye; and complains of a
frivolous public. A geometrician can
draw no deductions, and &s;ees nothing
proved, by the fine&s;t ver&s;es of a poet;
an antiquary marvels that an elegant hi&s;|torian
&s;hould be preferred to a chrono|loger;
and a metaphy&s;ician wonders at
the delight communicated by faithful re|pre&s;entations
of human life, written by
one whom he thinks incapable of com|prehending
a page of Locke.</P>
<P>It will &s;urpri&s;e the young and virtuous
reader, when I mu&s;t al&s;o add that the
character is &s;ometimes con&s;idered as a
kind of di&s;grace. To excel in tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments
<PB N="7" REF="29">
which enlighten or amu&s;e
a poli&s;hed people, has cea&s;ed to be a
merit with &s;ome, becau&s;e of the nume|rous
claimants for this honour. But it
is with authors as with tho&s;e military
fops who frequent the theatres, and a&s;|&s;ume
with their cockade, the title of
captain. Enquire, and you find that
the ob&s;treperous gentleman has been
only an en&s;ign for a week, and often
that he has no claims at all to the bor|rowed
cockade. Thus with authors, if
the pretenders are di&s;cerned, and the
ranks di&s;tingui&s;hed, a man will reduce
the number to a very incon&s;iderable por|tion
of a numerous acquaintance. Every
one who prints a book is not an author;
publication is the te&s;t of literature, and
there are an infinite number of works
which are printed, but which all the in|ventive
indu&s;try of the author could
never publi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="30">
Many of that cla&s;s of &s;ociety who&s;e en|tire

<P>Others know them&s;elves incapacitated

<P>There is, however, a race of ingenious

literature and literary men. This
is a paradox of the heart, of which
the &s;olution may appear difficult. Adrian

of his learning; and men of letters,
indulged the mo&s;t golden hopes, at his
acce&s;&s;ion; but on the contrary, he con|temned
literature, and per&s;ecuted &s;tu|dents.
A living orator, who&s;e chief
merit con&s;i&s;ts in his literary powers, it has
been &s;aid, performs in the pre&s;ent day,
the part of Adrian. Such men treat
&s;cience, as a barbarous &s;on, who &s;purns
at that parent, the milk of who&s;e bo&s;om
nurtured him in infancy, and who&s;e
hand &s;upported him in youth. A lite|rary
friend ob&s;erves, that the pope feared
le&s;t men of letters might &s;hake the pon|tificate,
and the orator, le&s;t they might
detect the errors of his politics; an ob|&s;ervation
which &s;hews the political in|fluence

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Men of Letters.</HEAD>
<P>WE di&s;tingui&s;h two kinds of Men
of Letters. Both alike make <HI>their prin|cipal
occupation</HI> to con&s;i&s;t in &s;tudy; but
the one are induced from many concur|ring
circum&s;tances not to publi&s;h their
labours; and the other devote their life
to communicate their &s;peculations to the
world. Few men of letters reject the
honours of an author, out of mode&s;ty;
but &s;ome are inert through terror, and
&s;ome through ea&s;e. The French (rich
in expre&s;&s;ions relative to polite letters)
di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e learned and tranquil
&s;tudents, by the happy title of <HI>littera|teurs.</HI></P>
<P>The popular notion of a man of let|ters
is as un&s;ettled, as unju&s;t. It is &s;up|po&s;ed
that becau&s;e a taylor makes a
<PB N="12" REF="34">
fa&s;hionable coat, and a builder erects a
hou&s;e according to modern ta&s;te, a man
of letters mu&s;t therefore produce a book,
adapted to the reigning mode. It is
not nece&s;&s;ary that every man of letters
&s;hould become an author, though it is
the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of an author to be
a man of letters. Some &s;uppo&s;e that it
is &s;ufficient when they commence au|thors,
to &s;tudy what they write, it would
be advantageous if we write al&s;o what we
&s;tudy; for without learning, few works
are valuable; and he who employs not a
u&s;eful cement, will &s;ee his brilliant edifice
&s;cattered by the winds, in &s;hining frag|ments.</P>
<P>The man of letters, is in general, a
more amiable character than the author.
His pa&s;&s;ions are more ferene, his &s;tudies
more regular, his &s;olitude more &s;oothing.
He encounters no concealed or public
enemy, and his tranquillity is not a
<PB N="13" REF="35">
feather in the popular gale. Every di&s;|covery
he makes is a happy conque&s;t;
every charm of ta&s;te a &s;ilent enjoyment.</P>
<P>Nor are &s;uch characters as the multi|tude
imagine unu&s;eful in the republic of
letters. To the elegant lei&s;ure of the&s;e
&s;tudents we are indebted for many of the
ornaments of literature; and authors
them&s;elves have recour&s;e to the&s;e &s;ages,
as their conductors, and &s;ometimes as
their patrons. The&s;e men of letters, like
guides over the Alps, though no travel|lers
them&s;elves, warn the adventurous
explorer of impending danger, and in|&s;truct
him in his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>No literary character is more fre|quently
amiable than &s;uch a man of let|ters.
The occupations he has cho&s;en,
are ju&s;tly called the &s;tudies of humanity;
and they communicate to his manners,
his under&s;tanding, and his heart, that
refined amenity, that lively &s;en&s;ibility,
<PB N="14" REF="36">
and that luminous acutene&s;s which flow
from a cultivated ta&s;te. He is an enthu|&s;ia&s;t;
but an enthu&s;ia&s;t for elegance. He
loves literature, like virtue, for the har|mony
it diffu&s;es over the pa&s;&s;ions; and
perceives, that like religion, it has the
&s;ingular art of communicating with an
unknown and future &s;tate. For the love
of po&s;terity is cheri&s;hed by the&s;e men of
letters; and though they want the energy
of genius to addre&s;s the public, often for
that public, they labour in &s;ilence. It
is they who form public libraries; father
neglected, and nurture infant genius;
project and &s;upport benevolent in&s;titu|tions,
and pour out the philanthropy of
their heart, in that world, which they ap|pear
to have for&s;aken.</P>
<P>Their mild di&s;po&s;itions fir&s;t led them
into the province of literature. They
found in books an occupation congenial
to their &s;entiments; labour without fa|tigue;
<PB N="15" REF="37">
repo&s;e with activity; an employ|ment,
interrupted without inconvenience,
and exhau&s;tle&s;s without &s;atiety. They
remain ever attached to their &s;tudies;
for to give a new direction to life, would
require a va&s;t effort, and of exertion they
are incapable. Their library and their
chamber are contiguous; and often in
this contracted &s;pace, does the opulent
owner con&s;ume his delicious hours.&mdash;His pur&s;uits are ever changing, and he
enlivens the au&s;tere by the lighter &s;tu|dies.
It was &s;aid of a great hunter, that
he did not live, but hunted; and it may
be &s;aid of the man of letters, that he
does not live, but meditates. He feels
that plea&s;ing anxiety, which ze&s;ts de&s;ire,
ari&s;ing from irritative curio&s;ity; and he
is that happy man who creates hourly
wants, and enjoys the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of
immediate gratification. The world pity
the man of letters inhumed among his
<PB N="16" REF="38">
books, and their mi&s;taken wit in&s;cribes
on his door, <Q REND="inline">here lies the body of our
friend!</Q> Yet unthinking men are not
without excu&s;e; his plea&s;ures are &s;ilent
and concealed. Whatever is not tran|quil
alarms; whatever is &s;erene attracts;
he therefore becomes a Mecenas, but
never a Virgil; protects letters, but never
compo&s;es books; a lover of art, but never
an arti&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e men of letters form penetrating
critics, who&s;e ta&s;te is habitual, and who&s;e
touch is firm and unerring. Critici&s;m
is happily adapted to their powers of
action; becau&s;e in critici&s;m they par|take
of the plea&s;ures of genius, without
the painful exertion of invention; and as
they are incapable of exerting invention,
and direct their &s;tudies to form and
poli&s;h judgment, this latter faculty is
often more cultivated, and more vigo|rous,
than even that of men of genius.
<PB N="17" REF="39">
Few writers attain to any perfection un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by &s;uch a connoi&s;&s;eur; the viva|city
and enthu&s;ia&s;m of genius are indulged
often in violations of delicacy and truth;
and what the author wants is preci&s;ely
what this critic can alone give. It is
not to be doubted that the familiar ac|quaintance
which exi&s;ted between Racine,
Boileau, and Moliere, was mo&s;t precious
to them. We know that they commu|nicated
their arts of compo&s;ition, and
&s;tood centinels over each other with the
&s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t vigilant eye. Hence
that equable power, and fini&s;hed elegance
which di&s;tingui&s;h their productions.&mdash;Corneille, who a&s;&s;ociated with neither,
and like a &s;ultan would in&s;pire awe, by
concealing him&s;elf in &s;olitary grandeur,
lo&s;t the&s;e invaluable conferences, and
indulged genius carele&s;s of the ra&s;ures of
ta&s;te. Hence his gro&s;s defects and ir|regularities.
In England, where &s;uch
<PB N="18" REF="40">
an union has been rare, we can trace the
&s;ame effects. Pope, Swift, and Boling|broke,
were of mutual advantage; Pope
had not been a philo&s;opher without the
aid of Bolingbroke; and Swift, an in|ferior
poet, without the &s;alutary coun|&s;els
of Pope. Milton, &s;evered from all
literary friends, has left in his &s;ublime
epics, too many traces of this &s;eparation;
and it may be &s;aid that his greate&s;t works
contain his greate&s;t blemi&s;hes. In the
fini&s;hed pieces of his youth, when he
had a critical eye at every hour on every
page, we find no want of corrective
touches. Churchill, a great and irre|gular
genius, with &s;uch friends had not
only left his fatires more terfe, and more
harmohious, but had been incapable, in
his feeble&s;t hours, to have &s;o frequently
compo&s;ed, &s;uch a &s;eries of unconnected
and pro&s;aic rhimes.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="41">
Often, by an excellent di&s;cernment,
the&s;e critics give a happy direction to
the powers of a young writer. Such
was the ob&s;ervation of Wal&s;h, who&s;e ad|vice
to Pope, that correctne&s;s in our
poetry was the only means which re|mained
to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, animated
the poet, to form that prominent and
beautiful feature in his poetical character.</P>
<P>To prove their great utility to men of
genius, the following in&s;tance may &s;erve.
Not always he who&s;e abilities are capable
of adorning the page of hi&s;tory, is alike
capable of di&s;covering the hidden and
perplexed tracks of learned re&s;earch.
Men of genius rarely read catalogues. To
whom is the philo&s;ophic writer of mo|dern
hi&s;tory to have recour&s;e, but to &s;uch
a man of letters? When Robert&s;on pro|po&s;ed
writing his various hi&s;tories, he
was ignorant of his &s;ubject, and irre&s;o|lute
in his de&s;igns. We had nearly lo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="42">
his elegant compo&s;itions. He confe&s;&s;ed
in letters, which I have &s;een addre&s;&s;ed to
Dr. Birch, that <Q REND="inline">he had never acce&s;s to
copious libraries, nor an exten&s;ive
knowledge of authors.</Q> Dr. Birch,
who was an admirable <HI>litterateur,</HI> in his
an&s;wer has given a copious and critical
catalogue of proper authors, accompa|nied
by valuable information, which is
acknowledged by our elegant hi&s;torian
with warmth. It was certainly that kind
of nece&s;&s;ary knowledge, which only the
learning of our &s;cholar could &s;upply, and
without which the project of Robert&s;on's
hi&s;tories mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the con|ception.
The&s;e &s;tudents are therefore
u&s;eful members in the republic of letters,
and may be compared to tho&s;e &s;ubterra|neous
&s;treams, which flow into &s;pacious
lakes, and which, though they flow in|vi&s;ibly,
enlarge the waters which attract
the public eye.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="43">
Sometimes the&s;e men of letters di&s;|tingui&s;h
them&s;elves by their productions;
but though the&s;e may be excellent, they
always rank in the inferior departments
of literature; and they rarely occupy
more than the fir&s;t place in the &s;econd
cla&s;s. Their works are fini&s;hed com|po&s;itions
of ta&s;te, or eccentric re&s;earches
of curio&s;ity, &s;eldom the fervid labours of
high invention. They are ingenious
men, not men of genius. If they pour
forth their effu&s;ions in ver&s;e, we may
have &s;ome delicate opu&s;cula; elaborate
beauties, but not of an original kind.
Such are many of our minor poets, di&s;|tingui&s;hed
for the refinements, but not
the powers of their art. They may ex|cel
in happy ver&s;ions of a cla&s;&s;ic; of
which we have many admirable proofs.
Their inquiries may be learned, the fruits
of ince&s;&s;ant labour, and long lei&s;ure;
and they &s;ometimes chu&s;e for their di&s;|&s;ertations,
<PB N="22" REF="44">
&s;ertations, uncommon topics. The&s;e
they treat often with ingenuity, but
chiefly enchant by a &s;eductive manner.
They have a certain glow, like a gentle
and regular fire; but which never fla&s;hes
and flames like a powerful inventive
mind. It is rather the fire rai&s;ed in a
forge, than bur&s;ting from a natural vol|cano.
Such writers are the authors of
tho&s;e little e&s;&s;ays, which are precious to
men of ta&s;te; on painting, and on poetry;
on beauty, and on deformity. Elegant
minds, that imbue with elegance light
&s;ubjects; their &s;trokes are not continued
and grand, but occa&s;ional and brilliant;
and if they rarely excite admiration by
new combinations of reflection or ima|gery,
often paint, with a mellow warmth,
the beauty of &s;entiment. In &s;uch at|tempts
they &s;ucceed; becau&s;e they &s;elect
their &s;ubject, with the fondne&s;s of a
lover, and are familiar with its re&s;erved
<PB N="23" REF="45">
graces. When unfortunately they at|tempt
higher topics, which require ele|vated
conceptions, and fervid genius, we
perceive their feeble energies. Such
writers, like the lark, mu&s;t only ri&s;e on
a playful wing, and re&s;ound their favou|rite
notes; but a man of genius, like a
hawk, elevates him&s;elf to di&s;cover the
country, and to dart on his prey.</P>
<P>We &s;hall elucidate the&s;e reflections by
the character of M. Sacy. He was
mode&s;t, ingenious, and &s;en&s;itive. He
cultivated his talents with ardour, and
&s;oothed the labours of the bar, with the
&s;tudies of polite letters. He gave a
ver&s;ion of Pliny, which has not injured
the delicacy of the original. Admitted
to the circle of the Marchione&s;s de Lam|bert,
he enjoyed the familiarity of men
of genius; and by the &s;en&s;ibility of his
heart, engaged the affections of the
Marchione&s;s more forcibly than even the
<PB N="24" REF="46">
genius of &s;uperior minds. Animated by
his &s;ocial enjoyments, he wrote with
amenity, an intere&s;ting E&s;&s;ay on Friend|&s;hip.
In this he &s;ucceeded; for no mind
could be more &s;u&s;ceptible to it's &s;oft and
dome&s;tic raptures. He afterwards com|po&s;ed
an E&s;&s;ay on Glory; but here he
did not &s;ucceed. A man of genius alone
can write on &s;uch a topic; it requires a
mind that expands from the limits of a
family to a nation; from a nation to the
world; from the world to po&s;terity. Va&s;t
and gigantic operation of the &s;oul! This
is no tranquil &s;entiment of ta&s;te, but an
impetuous pa&s;&s;ion of genius. A Cicero,
not a Sacy, &s;hould have written on
Glory; but Cicero did not feel more
exqui&s;itely than the amiable Sacy, on
the &s;ubject of Friend&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On &s;ome Characteri&s;tics of a Youth of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>I PROPOSE to &s;ketch &s;ome of the mi&s;|fortunes
which often attend a writer, or
an arti&s;t. Should my picture prove to be
a faithful repre&s;entation, my feelings will
di&s;po&s;e me to lament my talent.</P>
<P>To what an unknown height might an
adequate education elevate the human
character, if it were po&s;&s;ible at his birth
to detect the future genius. The o&s;trich
has the &s;agacity to di&s;cover in it's eggs,
tho&s;e which are worthy of her genial
warmth, and &s;eparates them from the
re&s;t, which would have proved &s;terile to
the &s;olicitous cares of a mother. It is not
thus with the human race. If we could
perceive the man of genius, in "the na|tal
hour," we might &s;elect him from
the croud, and nouri&s;h the giant, with
<PB N="26" REF="48">
the aliment a giant may be &s;uppo&s;ed to
require. At the age of twenty his ma|turity
would appear; and he would have
performed at thirty whatever a Horace
or a Livy have done; while the vigour
of life yet remained to &s;hew us &s;omething
more exqui&s;ite in fancy, and more com|plicate,
yet clear in rea&s;oning, than at
pre&s;ent we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive. But,
alas! it is only the romantic eye of the
poet, which can ob&s;erve the graces
wreathing his cradle with myrtles. I quit
my fanta&s;tic man of genius to de&s;cend to
nature and to experience.</P>
<P>It is rather &s;ingular that none but
princes, and mon&s;ters, have the privi|lege
or exciting public curio&s;ity at their
birth. A man of genius is dropt among
the people, and has fir&s;t to encounter the
difficulties of ordinary men, without that
confined talent which is adapted to a
mean de&s;timation. Parents, of hone&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="49">
di&s;po&s;itions, are the victims of the de|termined
propen&s;ity of a &s;on, to a Virgil
or an Euclid; and the fir&s;t &s;tep into life
of a man of genius is di&s;obedience and
grief.</P>
<P>The frequent &s;ituation of &s;uch a man
is de&s;cribed with great &s;implicity, by the
a&s;trologer Lilly, whether he were a man
of genius or not, in the curious memoirs
of his life. He there tells us, that having
propo&s;ed to his father that he &s;hould
try his fortune in London, where he
hoped his learning and his talents might
prove &s;erviceable to him, he ob&s;erves
that his father (who was incapable of di&s;|covering
his latent genius in his &s;tudious
di&s;po&s;itions) very willingly con&s;ented to
get rid of him, <Q REND="inline">for I could not <HI>work,</HI>
drive the plough, or endure any coun|try
labour; my father oft would &s;ay I
was <HI>good for nothing.</HI></Q>&mdash;The fathers of
mo&s;t of our men of genius have employed
<PB N="28" REF="50">
the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions as the father of
Lilly.</P>
<P>An apparent indolence hangs about
contemplative genius; he loves the re|po&s;e
of the body, and the activity of the
mind. It is known that mo&s;t men of
great abilities in their puerile days, have
retired from the &s;ports of their mates,
and while they were folded up in their
little wild ab&s;tractions, have appeared
dull to dunces. We often hear, from
the early companions or intimates of a
man of genius, that at &s;chool he had
been remarkably heavy and unpromi&s;ing;
but, in truth, he was only remarkably
pen&s;ive, and often pertinaciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i|duous.
The great Bo&s;&s;uet at &s;chool would
never join with his young companions,
but preferred plodding over a book.&mdash;They revenged them&s;elves by a boyi&s;h
je&s;t of calling him, <HI>bos &s;uetus aratro,</HI> an ox
daily toiling in the plough. It is curious
<PB N="29" REF="51">
to ob&s;erve, that the young painters, to
ridicule the con&s;tant labours of Domeni|chino
in his youth, did him the honour
to di&s;tingui&s;h him al&s;o by the title of
great Ox. Chatterton offers &s;till a
better, though a more melancholy in|&s;tance.
It is in this manner that one man
of genius generally re&s;embles another.</P>
<P>This inaction of body, and activity of
mind, they retain throughout life. A
man of genius is rarely enamoured of
common amu&s;ements. And the boy who
was unadroit at marbles, and refu&s;ed &s;ca|ling
the wall of an orchard, when a man,
&s;eldom excels as an agile hunter, or an
elegant dancer. I am de&s;cribing the en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of talent, not it's unintere&s;ting
mediocrity. A man of genius is the
&s;ure&s;t te&s;timony on this point. Let us
attend to the min&s;trel of Dr. Beattie.<Q><PB N="30" REF="52">
<L>Concour&s;e, and noi&s;e, and toil he ever fled,</L>
<L>Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray</L>
<L>Of &s;quabbling imps; but to the fore&s;t &s;ped.</L></Q>
<Q><L>The exploit of &s;trength, dexterity or &s;peed,</L>
<L>To him nor vanity, nor joy could bring.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Would Edwin this maje&s;tic &s;cene re&s;ign,</L>
<L>For aught the hunt&s;man's puny craft &s;upplies?</L></Q> I repeat, his mind alone has activity.&mdash;The fire &s;ide in the winter, and &s;ome
favourite tree in the &s;ummer, will be his
&s;eats; his amu&s;ements become &s;tudies,
and his meditations are made in his
walks, as well as in his chair. The&s;e
are &s;ome of the marks which di&s;tingui&s;h
him from the man of the world.</P>
<P>We have been able to di&s;cover this
di&s;po&s;ition in youthful genius; the &s;ame
characteri&s;es his age. It was thus when
Mecenas, accompanied by Virgil and
Horace, retired one day into the country,
the mini&s;ter amu&s;ed him&s;elf with a ten|nis-ball;
the two poets repo&s;ed on a
vernal bank, beneath a delicious &s;hade.
<PB N="31" REF="53">
Pliny was plea&s;ed with the Roman mode
of hunting, which admitted him to &s;it a
whole day with his tablets and &s;tylus,
that (he &s;ays) if I return with empty
nets, my tablets may at lea&s;t be full.</P>
<P>Among the inau&s;picious circum&s;tances
which frequently attend the fir&s;t exertions
of juvenile genius, is the want of &s;en&s;i|bility
and di&s;cernment, in the literary
man or arti&s;t who&s;e regard and coun&s;els
he &s;olicits. Remote from the world of
ta&s;te, he cultivates with ardour, but not
with art, talents which tremble in the
feeblene&s;s of infancy. When the intel|lectual
offspring is &s;truggling with pain,
and fear, into exi&s;tence, the hand that
&s;hould aid it's delivery repels with an un|natural
barbarity. As Churchill &s;ays,
<Q>They cru&s;h a Bard, ju&s;t bur&s;ting from the &s;hell!</Q>
In the&s;e wild hours of youth and fancy,
the juvenile writer roves like an in&s;ulated
<PB N="32" REF="54">
wanderer. Thrown on an enchanted i&s;le,
his ear li&s;tens with an artle&s;s impatience
for the cele&s;tial tones of an Ariel. It is
his unhappy fate to encounter a brutal
and malicious Caliban. Such has been
the &s;ituation of &s;everal men of genius
when they fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to
an unworthy man of letters for their
protector.</P>
<P>Another unfriendly influence over
young genius is the want of di&s;cernment
in tho&s;e, who have the direction of their
talents. Pope was often heard to &s;ay,
that he could learn nothing from his
ma&s;ters, for they wanted &s;agacity to di&s;|cover
the bent of his genius; and the
preceptors of Thom&s;on, reprimanded the
poet, for being too poetical in &s;ome of
his exerci&s;es. The judicious Quintilian
ob&s;erves, that it is not &s;ufficient that a
ma&s;ter in&s;tructs his &s;cholars in &s;cience;
but he &s;hould al&s;o cultivate tho&s;e par|ticular
<PB N="33" REF="55">
good qualities nature has be|&s;towed
on each; to add, to tho&s;e which
are deficient, to correct &s;ome, and to
change others.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy truth, that the
period at which men receive the colour
of their life, is that which is generally
lea&s;t regarded. When we mo&s;t want
judgment, we have none; and age is
often pa&s;&s;ed only in lamentations over
youth. The eventful moment which
determines our future years, is min|gled
and lo&s;t among hours which can|not
be recalled. Phy&s;icians tell us,
that there is a certain point in youth, at
which our con&s;titution takes it's form,
and on which the &s;anity of life revolves.
The exi&s;tence of genius, experiences a
&s;imilar dangerous moment. Ta&s;te er|roneou&s;ly
directed, or genius un&s;ubdued;
feeblene&s;s not invigorated, or vigour not
&s;oftened; are the accidents which render
<PB N="34" REF="56">
even a &s;uperior mind defective in it's
be&s;t performances. Children by the neg|ligence
of their parents become ricketty,
and all their life retain &s;ome trace of the
unhappy di&s;tortion of their limbs. The
predominant blemi&s;hes of an author, if
enquired into, will be found generally to
originate in their indulgence at a time
when they wanted a Quintilian, to deter
them by exerci&s;ing &s;ome contrary quality
to that, of which they were vitiou&s;ly en|amoured.
The epigrammatic points, and
&s;welling thoughts of Young; the remote
conceits of Cowley, and the turgidity of
John&s;on, might probably have been
avoided by their authors, had the bent
of their mind at an early period, been
moulded by a critic hand. Few literary
vices are radical, unle&s;s permitted to
&s;trike deeply in the &s;oil. Oaks, are but
&s;aplings, till they are &s;uffered to become
oaks.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="57">
The peculiarities of genius are often
derived from local habits, or accidental
circum&s;tances; and this remark &s;hews
the unwearied vigilance nece&s;&s;ary to be
ob&s;erved in the progre&s;s and formation
of genius. Rembrandt is one in&s;tance;
his peculiarity of &s;hade was derived from
the circum&s;tance of his father's mill re|ceiving
light from an aperture at the top,
which habituated him afterwards to that
&s;ingular manner of broad &s;hades. The
&s;ame analogy may be traced in the hu|man
intellect. A man of genius is often
determined to &s;hape his mind into a par|ticular
form, by the books of his youth.
Dr. Franklin tells us, that when young,
and wanting books, he accidentally found
De Foe's E&s;&s;ay on Projects, from which
work he thinks impre&s;&s;ions were derived
that afterwards influenced &s;ome of the
principal events of his life. It was by a
&s;tudious peru&s;al of Plutarch's illu&s;trious
<PB N="36" REF="58">
men, that Rou&s;&s;eau received that gran|deur
of &s;entiment which di&s;tingui&s;hes all
his compo&s;itions, and created him that
romantic and &s;en&s;itive being he ever re|mained.</P>
<P>If we except &s;ome rare in&s;tances, no
writer can di&s;play his talents &s;o indi&s;pu|tably
that the world &s;hall be con&s;cious of
his exalted genius, at an early period.
Du Bos and Helvetius have fixed that
great hour in the &s;hort day of man, about
the age of thirty; and I recollect an old
Spani&s;h writer lays it down as an axiom,
that no author &s;hould publi&s;h a book
under the age of thirty-five. It is cer|tain
that many of our fir&s;t geniu&s;es,
have not evinced their abilities till forty.
Some indeed &s;pring &s;uddenly like a
flower; while others expand gradually
like a tree. Some are like diamonds
which receive their fine poli&s;h from an ela|borate
<PB N="37" REF="59">
art, while others re&s;emble pearls
which are born with their beautiful lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Is it enquired if during this long pe|riod
a man of genius does not give &s;ome
evident marks of his future powers? I
an&s;wer that &s;ometimes he does; &s;ome|times
he does not; and &s;ometimes they
are dubious. They are frequently dubi|ous,
becau&s;e the gro&s;&s;e&s;t pedant attends
to his &s;tudies, if not with the &s;ame af|fection,
at lea&s;t with as much con&s;tancy
as the fine&s;t genius. Who can di&s;tingui&s;h
between pertinacity and genius? It is,
perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible to know if a young
&s;tudent will be a compiler, or an hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t effu&s;ions of a man of genius
may be &s;o rude, as were tho&s;e of Swift
and Dryden, that no rea&s;onable hope
can be formed of his happy progre&s;s.
The juvenile productions of many great
writers evince nothing of that perfection
they afterwards obtained; and probably
<PB N="38" REF="60">
Raphael when he fir&s;t &s;hadowed his rude
man, on his father's earthenware, had
not one &s;troke of that ideal beauty, which
one day his head was to conceive, and
his hand to attempt.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;uperior mind gives no
evidence of it's great powers; genius
may, like Aeneas, be veiled by a cloud,
and remain unperceived even by it's a&s;|&s;ociates;
as in the ca&s;e of Gold&s;mith,
whom even his literary companions re|garded
as a compiler, not as a writer of
ta&s;te. Hume was con&s;idered for his &s;o|briety
and a&s;&s;iduity, as capable of be|coming
a good merchant; of John&s;on it
was &s;aid, that he would never offend in
conver&s;ation, and of Boileau, that he had
no great under&s;tanding, but would &s;peak
ill of no one. Farquhar, who afterwards
joined to great knowledge of the world,
the livelie&s;t talents, was at college a
heavy companion, and unrea&s;onably dull.
<PB N="39" REF="61">
The&s;e, from numerous in&s;tances, will be
&s;ufficient. Again, when a &s;uperior mind
evinces it's early genius, it is not always
done with all it's energy; we have &s;everal
who began ver&s;ifiers, and concluded poets.</P>
<P>It happens, however, that &s;ometimes
genius unequivocally di&s;covers it&s;elf in
the puerile age. Some appear to have
meditated on the art they love, on the
bo&s;om of their nur&s;e; and they are pain|ters
and poets before they know the
names of their colours, and the fabric of
their ver&s;e. Michael Angelo, as yet a
child, wherever he went, employed him|&s;elf
in drawing, which &s;o much alarmed
his noble parents, who were fearful their
family might be di&s;honoured by a man
of genius, that they mingled ca&s;tigations
with their reprimands. Angelo relin|qui&s;hed
the pencil, but it was only to
take the bru&s;h. When he attempted
&s;tatuary, his father blu&s;hed to think his
<PB N="40" REF="62">
&s;on was a &s;tone-cutter. Angelo per&s;i&s;ted,
and became a great man in oppo&s;ition to
his noble progenitors. Vela&s;quez, a Spa|ni&s;h
painter, when he performed his
&s;chool ta&s;ks, filled them with &s;ketches
and drawings; and, as &s;ome write their
names on their books, his were known
by exhibiting &s;pecimens of his genius.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervation may be introduced
here which is due to the parents of a man
of genius.</P>
<P>We never read the biography of a
great character, whether he excelled in
letters, or the fine arts, without repro|bating
the dome&s;tic per&s;ecution of tho&s;e,
who oppo&s;ed his inclinations, and en|deavoured
to unfeather the tender pinion
of juvenile genius. No poet but is rou&s;ed
with indignation, at the recollection of
the Port Royal Society thrice burning
the poetical romance, which Racine at
length got by heart; no geometrician
<PB N="41" REF="63">
but bitterly criminates the father of
Pa&s;cal for not &s;uffering him to read
Euclid, which he at length under&s;tood
without reading; no painter, but exe|crates
the parents of Angelo, for &s;natch|ing
the pencil from his hand, though at
length he became &s;uperior to every arti&s;t.
All this is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us place our&s;elves in the &s;ituation
of a parent of a man of genius, and we
&s;hall find another a&s;&s;ociation of ideas
concerning him than tho&s;e we have at
pre&s;ent. We &s;ee a great man, they a
di&s;obedient child; we &s;ee genius, they
ob&s;tinacy. The career of genius is rarely
that of fortune; and very often that of
contempt. Even in it's mo&s;t flattering
a&s;pect, what is it, but plucking a few
brilliant flowers from precipices, while
the reward terminates in the honour?
The anxious parent is more de&s;irous of
his &s;on's cultivating the low-lands where
<PB N="42" REF="64">
indu&s;try may reap, in &s;ilent peace, no
precarious harve&s;t. But I even confe&s;s
that many parents are them&s;elves not &s;o
in&s;en&s;ible to glory, but that they would
prefer a &s;plendid poverty, to an ob&s;cure
opulence; but who is to be certain that
a young man is obeying the &s;olicitation
of true genius, or merely the fondne&s;s
for an art, in which he mu&s;t never be an
arti&s;t? Literary men them&s;elves fre|quently
are aver&s;e to encourage the lite|rary
di&s;po&s;itions of their children.</P>
<P>It is certain that a love for any art, in
youth, is no evidence of genius. The
ca&s;ual peru&s;al of Spen&s;er, which might
produce a Cowley, has no doubt given
birth to a croud of unknown poets. We
have a con&s;iderable number of minor
arti&s;ts, of all kinds, who never attain to
any degree of eminence, and yet in their
youth felt a warm inclination for their
art. If the impul&s;e of genius, and the
<PB N="43" REF="65">
per&s;everance of de&s;ire, if conception and
imitation, could ever be accurately di&s;|tingui&s;hed
in the philo&s;ophy of the mind,
it would be one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of me|taphy&s;ical
&s;peculations. But philo&s;o|phers
have not yet agreed of the nature
of genius, for while &s;ome conceive it to
be a gift; others think it an acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>We now proceed to &s;ome reflections
on the friends of youthful genius.</P>
<P>The friends of a young writer are ge|nerally
prejudicial. To find a &s;age
Quintilian in a private circle, is as rare
as to di&s;cover a &s;ilver mine in Devon|&s;hire;
it is &s;uppo&s;ed there are &s;everal,
but it is difficult to know where nature
has placed them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is a duty I owe as an individual, not to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the mention of Devon&s;hire, which I have long con&s;idered as the cla&s;&s;ical county of England. It has it's poets and it's antiquaries, it's mu&s;icians and it's painters. There is, perhaps, in con&s;equence, that diffu&s;ion of urbanity in the manners of many of it's chief inhabitants, which graces enlightened opulence. Devon&s;hire has produced more illu&s;trious characters than I believe any other county. A Monte&s;quien and a Du Bos would attribute this to the felicity of the climate, where myrtles grow un&s;heltered in the open air. And perhaps the air which cheri&s;hes myrtles in our northern clime, may have no incon&s;iderable effect on men. The &s;peculation may not be merely fanci|ful; here the earth di&s;plays a more luxuriant herbage on a &s;ofter mould; the &s;kies a brighter azure, and the airs blow with what poets call,
<Q>The &s;ilky-&s;oft favonian gale. <BIBL>Young.</BIBL></Q>
A Devon&s;hire poet is the only Engli&s;h bard who has a right to tran&s;po&s;e the epithets of Virgil in his de|&s;criptions of Spring. It is a &s;oil favourable to myrtles and arti&s;ts.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="66">
We may ob&s;erve, that the productions
of ta&s;te are much more unfortunate than
tho&s;e of rea&s;oning. Every man has a
tolerable degree of judgment, and with
a &s;light exertion, atchieves the compre|hen&s;ion
of a piece of argument; but
ta&s;te is of &s;uch rarity, that a long life
may be pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome, without ever
meeting with a per&s;on of that cultured
and &s;ure ta&s;te, which can touch and feel
<PB N="45" REF="67">
the public opinion, before the public
forms it's opinion.</P>
<P>When a young writer's fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay is
&s;hown, &s;ome, through mere inability of
cen&s;ure, &s;ee nothing but beauties; others,
with equal imbecillity can &s;ee none; and
others, out of pure malice, &s;ee nothing
but faults. Few great writers have been
born in that fortunate and rare circle,
where every man has ta&s;te, and &s;ome
have candour. A young writer, if he
&s;uffers his mind to float from uncertainty
to uncertainty, will only lo&s;e many years
before he di&s;covers the imbecillity and
defective ta&s;te of the narrow circle of
his critics.</P>
<P>A young arti&s;t mu&s;t bani&s;h de&s;pon|dence,
even in the rude&s;t efforts of art.
He mu&s;t obey the fervid impul&s;e at the
co&s;t of the plea&s;ures of his age, and the
contempt of his a&s;&s;ociates. It may al&s;o
be no improper habit to pre&s;erve his ju|venile
<PB N="46" REF="68">
compo&s;itions. By contemplating
them he may perceive &s;ome of his pre|dominant
errors; reflect on the gradual
corrections; re&s;ume an old manner more
happily, invent a new one from the old
he had neglected; and often may find
&s;omething &s;o fine, among his mo&s;t irre|gular
productions, that it may &s;erve to
embelli&s;h his mo&s;t fini&s;hed compo&s;itions.
I cannot but apply to this &s;ubject, a
happy &s;imile of Dryden, which a young
writer, in the progre&s;s of his &s;tudies,
&s;hould often recollect.<Q><L>As tho&s;e who unripe veins in mines explore,</L>
<L>On the rich bed, again, the warm turf lay,</L>
<L>Till time dige&s;ts the yet imperfect ore,</L>
<L>And knows it will be gold another day.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let him therefore at once &s;upply the
marble, and be him&s;elf the &s;culptor; he
mu&s;t learn to hew out, to form, and to
poli&s;h his genius. He mu&s;t appeal from
a contracted circle, to the public; and
<PB N="47" REF="69">
throughout life, mu&s;t hold this as a
maxim, if he would pre&s;erve the nece&s;|&s;ary
tranquillity to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies,
that the opinion of an individual mu&s;t be
accounted as nothing; not even if this
opinion &s;hould appear in print. Helve|tius
ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, what does the opi|nion
of any individual mean? Only,
that if favourable, he entertains the &s;ame
ideas as my&s;elf; and if unfavourable,
that we differ.</P>
<P>Who but the public can arbitrate be|tween
an arti&s;t and his critic? Should
even the cen&s;ures of the critic be ju&s;t,
and the arti&s;t notwith&s;tanding plea&s;e, it
is an additional evidence, that he is
among the greate&s;t arti&s;ts. It is thus
with Shake&s;peare and Churchill.</P>
<P>If &s;everal of our fir&s;t writers had at|tended
to the &s;entiments of their friends,
we &s;hould have lo&s;t &s;ome of our mo&s;t
precious compo&s;itions. The friends of
<PB N="48" REF="70">
Thom&s;on could di&s;cern nothing but
faults in his early productions, not ex|cepting
his &s;ublime Winter! This poet
of humanity has left a vindictive epi|gram
again&s;t one of the&s;e friends, and it
is perhaps the only ill-natured lines, he
ever wrote. He came with impatience
to London, publi&s;hed, and made his
genius known. Voltaire, when his Brutus
was un&s;ucce&s;sful, was advi&s;ed not to turn
his attention to the &s;tage. He replied to
his friends by writing Zara, Alzire, and
Mahomet. The Mirror when publi&s;hed
in Edinburgh was "fa&s;tidiou&s;ly" re|ceived;
the authors appealed from Edin|burgh
to London, and they have pro|duced
the literary plea&s;ures of thou&s;ands!</P>
<P>It is dangerous for a young writer to
re&s;ign him&s;elf to the opinions of his
friends; it is alike dangerous to pa&s;s
them with inattention. What an em|barra&s;&s;ment!
If he has not an excellent
<PB N="49" REF="71">
judgment he will not know what to re|ject
and what to receive of tho&s;e varying
opinions; and if he has an excellent
judgment, he wants little of their aid.</P>
<P>A young writer mu&s;t long and dili|gently
&s;tudy his great models without
venturing on the vanity of critici&s;m. He
who begins to analy&s;e before he is ac|quainted
with the nature of his materials,
like an ignorant chymi&s;t, may &s;uppo&s;e
he is making experiments, when he is in
the act of injuring his untutored and au|dacious
hand. He mu&s;t read for many
years his authors, as &s;ome the go&s;pels,
with the &s;ame faith and the &s;ame admi|ration.
For what he once wanted in|tellectual
reli&s;h, he will come to admire,
and what he admires he will imitate. He
cannot too often peru&s;e tho&s;e many criti|cal
performances which the philo&s;ophical
ta&s;te of the age has produced. It &s;hould
be con&s;idered, that by reading an excel|lent
<PB N="50" REF="72">
critic, he receives the knowledge of
many years in a few hours. The di&s;|coveries
of art are tardy, and critici&s;m
&s;upplies this deficiency. The more ex|ten&s;ive
an arti&s;t's knowledge of what has
been done, the more va&s;t will be his
powers in knowing what to do. Tho&s;e
who do not read critici&s;m, will not even
merit to be critici&s;ed. Yet we have un|reflecting
&s;tudents who inquire of the
utility of critici&s;m? Nothing may be
of happier con&s;equence than a habit of
comparing his thoughts and his &s;tyle
with the compo&s;itions of his ma&s;ters. If
in the compari&s;on, the &s;ilent voice of
&s;entiment exclaims in his heart, <Q REND="inline">I al&s;o
am a painter,</Q> it is not improbable
that the young arti&s;t may become a Cor|regio.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;entiment is nobly expre&s;&s;ed by Monte&s;quieu in the clo&s;e of his preface to his great work on laws.

vanqui&s;hed them by the &s;ame means; he
may hope one day that the world will re|ceive

In the golden age of Greece,
a Demo&s;thenes &s;aw him&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed
by future orators; and Plato li&s;tened to
<PB N="53" REF="75">
the plaudits of future philo&s;ophers. It
was a moment of delicious rapture, not
felt in the &s;olitary meditations of the
modern philo&s;opher, in who&s;e mind &s;en|&s;ations
ari&s;e cold and artificial compared
to their bur&s;t of &s;entiment and their fer|vour
of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet a virtuous citizen, amid&s;t the di&s;|&s;olution
of manners, may give to his re|&s;idence
a Roman au&s;terity, and di&s;play
the &s;ublime in life, as well as in compo|&s;ition.
He may be &s;eated at an attic
&s;upper, and,

<BIBL>Cowper.</BIBL></Q>
Nor is &s;uch a purity of manners incom|patible
with refined pa&s;&s;ions, and delicacy
of &s;entiment; a penetrating glance, a
tender pre&s;&s;ure, a &s;ilent &s;mile, may in|fu&s;e
into his heart tho&s;e genuine emo|tions
which are ever wanted and never
<PB N="54" REF="76">
found at tables more &s;plendidly profu&s;e,
and more elegantly crouded. A vene|rable
parent, a congenial friend, and a
female &s;u&s;ceptible of a kindred enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
are perhaps the utmo&s;t number
of happy companions, which a fortunate
man could ever a&s;&s;emble around him.</P>
<P>Is he deprived of the&s;e &s;ocial con&s;ola|tions,
like John&s;on, he calls tho&s;e who&s;e
calamities have exiled them from &s;o|ciety;
and his hou&s;e is an a&s;&s;emblage of
the blind, the lame, and the poor. In
the ardour of his emotions, he di&s;covers
that a word is wanting in the vocabulary
of humanity, and like the Abb&egrave; de Saint
Pierre, has the honour of fixing a new
word in the language; a word that
&s;erves to explain his own actions&mdash;<HI>Bien|fai&s;ance.</HI></P>
<P>His look is &s;erene, for &s;tudy, not for|tune,
forms his &s;ole occupation; and
accident cannot injure the &s;tability of his
<PB N="55" REF="77">
&s;oul, for virtue has long been a habit.
Is it enquired why this man appears an
anomalous being among his fellow citi|zens?&mdash;Becau&s;e he is the contemporary
of the greate&s;t men. He pa&s;&s;es his morn|ings
with Cicero and Demo&s;thenes, and
gives his nights to Socrates and Plato.</P>
<P>Such an one is the living exemplar of
that &s;ublime morality which we learn
with our latin at &s;chool, and which, when
we come into the world, we con&s;ider,
like our latin, to be merely a dead lan|guage.</P>
<P>He renders poverty illu&s;trious, and
proves that every man may be indepen|dent.
But we would be independent
only, in commanding &s;laves. He who
lives like a Spartan in voluptuous Sybaris,
is, however, independent; and this age
has produced men who pa&s;&s;ed the fer|vours
of youth in a philo&s;ophical &s;everity,
and &s;tudied (as &s;ome &s;tudy a language)
<PB N="56" REF="78">
to become great characters. Such were
Franklin and Elliot, Chatham and
Hume!</P>
<P>The actions and &s;tudies of &s;uch men
are not the only utility they be&s;tow on
the world; they leave &s;omething of a
more diffu&s;ive energy; they leave the
eternal memory of their CHARACTER;
they leave to remote&s;t po&s;terity their im|mortal
ve&s;tiges, while virtuous youth
contemplates them with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and
follows them with confidence.</P>
<P>We clo&s;e any further reflections on the
character of a philo&s;ophic writer, and
re&s;train our&s;elves to ob&s;ervations more
obvious, and to facts more u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Too often we &s;ee the &s;ublime&s;t minds,
and the tendere&s;t hearts, &s;ublime and
tender only in their productions. They
are not &s;urrounded by per&s;ons of ana|logous
ideas, who are alone capable of
drawing forth their virtues and affec|tions;
<PB N="57" REF="79">
as the powers of the magnet re|main
dormant unle&s;s applied to particles
capable of attraction. We hear of &s;eve|ral
great men, that they were undutiful
&s;ons&mdash;becau&s;e they di&s;plea&s;ed their fa|thers
in becoming great men&mdash;that they
were di&s;agreeable companions&mdash;becau&s;e
dullne&s;s or impertinence wearied&mdash;that
they were indifferent hu&s;bands&mdash;becau&s;e
they were united to women who did no
honour to the &s;ex. The&s;e are ordinary
accu&s;ations, ever received, while it is
forgotten that an accu&s;ation is not al|ways
a crime.</P>
<P>It were not difficult to de&s;cribe the
dome&s;tic life of mo&s;t men of genius, and
to ob&s;erve that their inmates have ren|dered
their Lares but rugged deities. I
would never draw conclu&s;ions from par|ticular
circum&s;tances, &s;uch as, that Ad|di&s;on
de&s;cribes his lady under the
character of Oceana, and Steele deline|ates
<PB N="58" REF="80">
his wife under that of Mi&s;s Prue;
the one was a &s;tormy ocean, and the
other a &s;tagnated &s;tream. But I re|mark
that many of the con&s;picuous
blemi&s;hes of &s;ome of our great compo|&s;itions
may rea&s;onably be attributed to
the dome&s;tic infelicities of their authors.
The de&s;ultory life of Camoens probably
occa&s;ioned the want of connection in his
Epic; Milton's di&s;tracted family tho&s;e
numerous pa&s;&s;ages which e&s;caped era|&s;ure;
and Cervantes may have been led,
through the ha&s;te of publication, into
tho&s;e little &s;lips of memory ob&s;ervable
in his Satirical Romance. The be&s;t
years of Meng's life were embittered by
the har&s;hne&s;s of his father; and it is
probable that this dome&s;tic per&s;ecution,
from which he was at length obliged to
fly, gave him tho&s;e moro&s;e and &s;aturnine
habits which he ever afterwards retained.
Of Alon&s;o Cano, a celebrated Spani&s;h
<PB N="59" REF="81">
painter, it is ob&s;erved by Mr. Cumber|land,
that he would have carried his art
much higher, had not the uncea&s;ing per|&s;ecution
of the inqui&s;itors deprived him
of that tranquillity which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary
to the very exi&s;tence of the fine arts.
Our poetry had probably attained to it's
acm&egrave;, before Pope, had the unfortu|nate
circum&s;tances of Dryden not occa|&s;ioned
his inequalities, his incorrectne&s;s,
and his copious page.</P>
<P>It is therefore an intere&s;ting ob&s;erva|tion
for a man of letters, and an arti&s;t,
to liberate him&s;elf early from dome&s;tic
anxieties. Let him, like Rou&s;&s;eau, leave
the rich financier, (though he might be|come
one him&s;elf,) &s;ell his watch, and
i&s;&s;ue from the palace, in independence
and enthu&s;ia&s;m. He mu&s;t al&s;o, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
like Crebillon, be &s;atisfied with
the re&s;pectable &s;ociety of a con&s;iderable
<PB N="60" REF="82">
number of grey hounds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crebillon pa&s;&s;ed much of his life in &s;olitude, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the company of a dozen fine large dogs in his room, which rendered the approach to our poet as formidable to the timorous, as to the delicate.</NOTE> The mo&s;t ar|dent
pa&s;&s;ion for glory can alone &s;timulate
to &s;uch a retirement; and indeed it is
only in &s;olitude that the mo&s;t eminent
geniu&s;es have been formed. Solitude is
the nur&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and enthu&s;ia&s;m
is the parent of genius. Literary &s;olitude
&s;hall therefore form our next object for
&s;peculation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. On Literary Solitude.</HEAD>
<P>MEN of Letters are reproached with
an extreme pa&s;&s;ion for retirement; and
&s;ome of the warme&s;t philanthropi&s;ts are
calumniated as haters of the human race.</P>
<P>Literary Retirement can have no guilt,
even if merely pa&s;&s;ed, in the uninter|rupted
examination of the trea&s;ures of
literature. When ta&s;te is formed, and
curio&s;ity becomes habitual, the mind
will not forego gratifications at once &s;a|cile
and exqui&s;ite. If it is &s;aid why the
&s;ame ingenuity of mind, that loves to
trace the cau&s;e, and to arrange the ef|fects,
is not turned to the objects of the
times, and thus render it&s;elf of more
apparent utility, I an&s;wer, that in the
contemplation of exi&s;ting &s;cenes, the
mind finds not the &s;ame gratification as
<PB N="62" REF="84">
in tho&s;e of the pa&s;t. What is pre&s;ent is
not yet terminated; the folly of the age
is not yet folly, and judgment pau&s;es
over my&s;terious pa&s;&s;ions. But in the
hi&s;tory of the human mind, to be calmly
traced in the volumes of other times,
every illu&s;ion is di&s;&s;ipated; and we re|ceive
the &s;ame plea&s;ure, as the &s;pectator
who beholds the cata&s;trophe of the tra|gedy,
or the comedy, which excited his
curio&s;ity. The hi&s;tory of the pa&s;t yields
a conclu&s;ion, and therefore a perfection
which cannot accompany that of the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The horizon of Re&s;earch is illimitable,
and the di&s;coveries of Truth are infinite.
New materials &s;erve but as the founda|tions
of others; we do not remain &s;a|tisfied
with building a hou&s;e, a palace,
or a &s;treet; but by impereeptible gra|dations
we erect a city.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="85">
This, perhaps, may &s;erve as an apo|logy
for Men of Letters, who con&s;ume
their days with innocence and philo&s;o|phy;
but who are frequently con&s;idered
to withdraw from duties which tho&s;e
who live to bu&s;tle, and tho&s;e who bu&s;tle
to live, are very far them&s;elves from
practi&s;ing. An active virtue, which in
the pre&s;ent day may be called heroi&s;m,
is frequently the amiable child of Soli|tude,
but rarely the companion of the
bu&s;y and the gay.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity, the
plea&s;ures, and the inconveniencies of So|litude,
to tho&s;e who enlighten the world
from the ob&s;curity of their retirement.</P>
<P>Solitude is indi&s;pen&s;able for literary
pur&s;uits. Every poet repeats,<Q>Carmina &s;ece&s;&s;um &s;cribentis et otia quaerunt.</Q> No con&s;iderable work has yet been com|po&s;ed,
but it's author, like an ancient
<PB N="64" REF="86">
magician, retired fir&s;t to the grove or
the clo&s;et, to invocate his &s;pirits. Every
compo&s;ition of genius is the production
of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and while enthu&s;ia&s;m
agitates the mind, the &s;olitude of a man
of letters re&s;embles a &s;cene of antient
Greece; a grove becomes &s;acred, and
in every retired &s;pot a divinity appears.</P>
<P>But it's enchantments are re&s;erved
alone for him. When he &s;ighs for the
intellectual decencies, and the grace of
fancy, and langui&s;hes in an irk&s;ome &s;o|litude
among crouds, that is the moment
to fly into &s;eclu&s;ion and meditation. He
alone experiences the delights of that
day, which is compre&s;&s;ed into a few
hours. Where can he indulge, but in
&s;olitude, the delicious romances of his
&s;oul? And where but in &s;olitude can he
occupy him&s;elf in u&s;eful dreams by night,
and when the morning ri&s;es, fly, with|out
interruption, to his unfini&s;hed la|bours?
<PB N="65" REF="87">
He finds many &s;ecret plea&s;ures,
and &s;ome glowing anticipations. There
is a &s;ociety, in the deepe&s;t &s;olitude, to
which a poli&s;hed mind &s;prings with ar|dour;
it embraces a thou&s;and congenial
&s;entiments, and mingles with a thou&s;and
exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations. The &s;olitude of
retirement to the frivolous pre&s;ents a va&s;t
and dreary de&s;ert; but to the man of
genius it blooms like the enchanted gar|den
of Armida.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation in which the poet
of &s;entiment and nature, amid&s;t the
works of his ma&s;ters, exclaims<Q>Fir&s;t of your kind, Society divine!
<BIBL>Thom&s;on.</BIBL></Q> In this &s;tillne&s;s of &s;oul, nature &s;eems
more beautiful, and more va&s;t. We
ob&s;erve men of genius, in public &s;itua|tions,
&s;ighing for this &s;olitude; it is
there only they feel their &s;uperiority,
<PB N="66" REF="88">
and live in a future age. Cicero was
unea&s;y amid&s;t applauding Rome, and he
has di&s;tingui&s;hed his numerous works
by the titles of his various villas, where
they were compo&s;ed. It will not be de|nied
that Voltaire had talents and a ta&s;te
for &s;ociety; yet he not only withdrew
by intervals, but at one period of his
life pa&s;&s;ed five years in the mo&s;t &s;ecret
&s;eclu&s;ion, and per&s;everance of &s;tudy.
Monte&s;quieu quitted the brilliant circles
of Paris for his books, his meditations,
and for his immortal work; and for this
he was ridiculed by the gay triflers he
relinqui&s;hed. Harrington, to compo&s;e
his Oceana, &s;evered him&s;elf from the
&s;ociety of his friends, and was &s;o wrapt
in ab&s;traction, that he was pitied as a
lunatic.</P>
<P>A heart thus di&s;po&s;ed, tears it&s;elf,
with reluctance, from it's contempla|tions,
and comes into &s;ociety without a
<PB N="67" REF="89">
po&s;&s;ibility of receiving, or producing it's
plea&s;ures. It may be urged that &s;everal
men of genius have found no difficulty
to level them&s;elves to ordinary under|&s;tandings.
I have heard that Hume
found great delight in the &s;ociety of two
old maids, at his evening whi&s;t; Fonte|nelle
and La Motte would patiently
li&s;ten to the frivolous and the dull; but
Fontenelle and La Motte, who&s;e genius
our hi&s;torian's greatly re&s;embled, were
two ingenious Frenchmen, celebrated
for their politene&s;s and their wit, not
for their &s;en&s;ibility and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>When a man of letters &s;eeks the con|&s;olations
of &s;ociety, he would re&s;t a
mind enfeebled with one continued pur|&s;uit;
or exerci&s;e it by &s;uffering it to take
tho&s;e infinite directions which the diver|&s;ities
of conver&s;ation offer. If it is wea|ried,
the &s;imple&s;t actions plea&s;e; it is a
child that would &s;port with flowers and
<PB N="68" REF="90">
pebbles; if it i&s;&s;ues in all it's force, it
is an athlet that leaps in the arena, and
calls for an adver&s;ary. It is Montaigne
&s;porting with his cat, or John&s;on main|taining
a the&s;is amid&s;t his marvelling
friends.</P>
<P>In either ca&s;e, ordinary &s;ociety offers
no charms, and can never be charmed.
A feeble mind knows not to unbend,
becau&s;e it was never yet extended; nor
can it elevate it&s;elf becau&s;e the &s;oul, ac|cording
to the figure of Plato, has no
wings.</P>
<P>Thus the mind of genius feels a con|tinued
irritation in the croud. Let us
attend to the expre&s;&s;ions of genius,
which can be&s;t de&s;cribe it's peculiar &s;en|&s;ibilities.
Petrarch frequently with|drew
to his immortal valley, alike di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the vulgar,
and the frivolity of the courtier; he
could not patiently &s;uffer that Being, whom
<PB N="69" REF="91">
he calls 'un huom del vulgo!' Cowley
regarded the common people as he did
bea&s;ts, and was di&s;plea&s;ed as much with
what he calls <Q REND="inline">the great as the little
vulgar.</Q> Among the perverted images
of a living orator, is that <Q REND="inline">of the hoofs
of the &s;wini&s;h multitude,</Q> and a ve|nerable
ancient prefers the &s;ociety of his
dog to &s;uch men. Fools (cries Du Clos)
reconcile men of genius to each other;
from the impo&s;&s;ibility of living with
fools. And to clo&s;e our te&s;timonies, with
a fine expre&s;&s;ion from Milton,
<Q><L>Among unequals what &s;ociety</L>
<L>Can &s;ort, what harmony or true delight?</L></Q></P>
<P>The interruption of vi&s;itors have been
feelingly lamented by men of letters.&mdash;The mind, occupied in maturing it's
&s;peculations, feels the approach of the
vi&s;itor by profe&s;&s;ion, as the &s;udden gales
of an ea&s;tern bla&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing over the blo&s;|&s;oms
<PB N="70" REF="92">
of &s;pring. We are afraid, &s;aid
&s;ome of the vi&s;itors to Baxter, that we
break in upon your time. To be &s;ure
you do, replied the di&s;turbed and blunt
&s;cholar. Ur&s;inus was laborious in his
literary avocations, and to hint as gently
as he could to his friends, that he was
avaricious of time; he placed an in|&s;cription
over the door of his &s;tudy, de|&s;iring,
that if any one chu&s;ed to remain,
they mu&s;t join in his labours. The ami|able
Melancthon, incapable of a har&s;h
expre&s;&s;ion, when he received the&s;e idle
vi&s;its, only noted down the time he had
expended, that he might reanimate his
indu&s;try, and not lo&s;e a day. Among
the di&s;turbers of dome&s;tic tranquillity,
may be cla&s;&s;ed tho&s;e unhappy wanderers
who be&s;iege the hou&s;es of their neigh|bours,
and like the barbarian &s;oldier,
enter the apartment of an Archimedes,
and murder him in the mid&s;t of his
&s;tudies.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="93">
But I am how to &s;ketch a different
picture of literary &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Zimmerman has compo&s;ed an elabo|rate
work on Solitude, in a general
manner. His &s;entiments are glowing,
and perhaps they are dangerous. Of
&s;olitude, men of genius mu&s;t always be
&s;ufficiently enamoured, without having
read that &s;educing de&s;cription of it's
&s;ublime plea&s;ures. Let us not, how|ever,
forget nature in enthu&s;ia&s;m. A
man of genius, though he addre&s;&s;es po&s;|terity,
has &s;en&s;ibilities and de&s;ires which
can only be gratified by his contempo|raries.
When great minds cannot readily
find that in the world they &s;eek, they
ha&s;ten into &s;eclu&s;ion. The craving void
remains unfilled; and for him who &s;ighs
for popularity in &s;olitude, every hour
&s;harpens de&s;ire, and aggravates di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="94">
The &s;olitude which is &s;ought by the
young &s;tudent is not borne without re|pining.
To tame the fervid wildne&s;s of
youth, to the &s;trict regularities of &s;tudy,
is a &s;acrifice which requires all the en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of the &s;incere&s;t votary. The
Academic Bower is not without it's rainy
days. Milton, not apt to vent com|plaints,
appears to have felt this irk&s;ome
period of life. He employs the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions
in the preface to Smectymnus.
<Q REND="inline">It is but ju&s;tice, not to defraud of due
e&s;teem the <HI>weari&s;ome labours</HI> and <HI>&s;tudious
watchings,</HI> wherein I have &s;pent, and
<HI>tired out,</HI> almo&s;t a whole youth.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps &s;olitude in a later period of
life, or rather the neglect which attends
that &s;olitude, is felt with more &s;en&s;ibi|lity.
It was thus that Cowley, that en|thu&s;ia&s;t
for rural &s;eclu&s;ion, in his retire|ment
called him&s;elf "the melancholy
Cowley;" and Mr. Ma&s;on has judici|ou&s;ly
<PB N="73" REF="95">
transferred the &s;ame epither to
Gray. Can we read his letters, and not
feel it's ju&s;tne&s;s? we lament al&s;o, the
lo&s;s of Cowley's corre&s;pondence, through
the mi&s;taken notion of Sprat, a lo&s;s cer|tainly
as invaluable, as irrecoverable.
The&s;e are the be&s;t memoirs of a man's
heart; the regi&s;ter of his feelings. But
Shen&s;tone has filled his pages with the
cries of an amiable heart that bleeds in
the oblivion of &s;olitude. In one of his
letters, are the&s;e melancholy expre&s;|&s;ions:
"Now I am come from a vi&s;it,
every little unea&s;ine&s;s is &s;ufficient to in|troduce
my whole train of melancholy
con&s;iderations, and to make me utterly
di&s;&s;atisfied with the life I now lead, and
the life I fore&s;ee I &s;hall lead. I am an|gry,
and envious, and dejected, and fran|tic,
and di&s;regard all pre&s;ent things as
becomes a madman to do. I am infi|nitely
plea&s;ed (though it is a gloomy joy)
<PB N="74" REF="96">
with the application of Dr. Swift's com|plaint,
that he is forced to die in a rage,
like a poi&s;oned rat in a hole." Without
exciting &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages in pro&s;e, let
the lover of &s;olitude mu&s;e on it's picture
throughout the year, in the following
&s;tanza.<Q><L>Tedious again to cur&s;e the drizzling day!</L>
<L>Again to trace the wintery tracks of &s;now!</L>
<L>Or &s;oothed by vernal airs again &s;urvey,</L>
<L>The &s;elf-&s;ame hawthorns bud, and cow&s;lips blow.</L></Q></P>
<P>Swift's letters paint a terrifying picture
of &s;olitude, and at length his de&s;pair
clo&s;ed with idioti&s;m. The amiable
Gre&s;&s;et, could not &s;port with the bril|liant
wings of his fancy, without &s;ome
querulous expre&s;&s;ions of an irk&s;ome &s;oli|tude.
In his "Epi&s;tle to his Mu&s;e,"
he thus exqui&s;itely paints the &s;ituation
of men of genius.<Q><L>&mdash;Je les vois, victimes du genie,</L>
<L>Au foible prix d'un eclat pa&s;&s;ager,</L>
<L>Vivre i&s;ol&egrave;s &s;ans jouir de la vie.</L></Q> <PB N="75" REF="97">
And afterwards he adds,<Q>Vingt ans d'Ennuis pour quelque jours de gloire!</Q></P>
<P>The following anecdote may amu&s;e
the reader. When Menage was attacked
by &s;ome, and abandoned by others, in
a &s;plenetic humour, he retreated into the
country, and gave up his famous Mer|curiales,
when the literati a&s;&s;embled at
his hou&s;e. He expected to find that
tranquillity in the country which he had
frequently de&s;cribed in his ver&s;es; but,
as he was only a poetical plagiari&s;t, it is
not wonderful that he was greatly di&s;|appointed.
Some malicious per&s;on hav|ing
killed his pigeons, it gave him more
vexation than his critics. He ha&s;tened
his return to Paris. It is better, he
cried, &s;ince we are born to &s;uffer, to feel
only rea&s;onable &s;orrows.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onably to be &s;u&s;pected, that
he only prefers &s;olitude, who cannot ac|compli&s;h
<PB N="76" REF="98">
his wi&s;hes in &s;ociety. I have
not yet been able to di&s;cover a great ge|nius,
who, courted by an attentive world,
per&s;i&s;ted in his retirement. Voltaire,

&s;ees only happine&s;s in &s;eclu&s;ion;
all his letters abound with quotations
from the poets, of the raptures of &s;oli|tude.
When his tragedies gave him ce|lebrity,
then his letters &s;ound a different

querulous &s;en&s;ibility; a &s;oftening charm,
that whatever it may have co&s;t their

more intere&s;ting. The tender
&s;hades of melancholy throw a grace
amid&s;t the brilliant lights of their fancy.
It is &s;aid that the nightingale, with a

<P>On the whole it may be &s;aid, that a

it becomes irk&s;ome. A great
experience of the world, without virtue,
will pine in &s;olitude, to exert it's talent
on tho&s;e who are &s;imple and unexperi|enced.
A great love of virtue, without

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. On the Meditations and Conver&s;ations of
Men of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>A CONTINUITY of attention is one of
the grand characteri&s;tics of genius, and
in proportion to the degree of the in|ten&s;ene&s;s
of ab&s;traction are it's powers
often obtained. A work on ABSTRAC|TION,
or the ART OF MEDITATION, is a
de&s;ideratum. It would be a valuable
pre&s;ent to all, and might prove of im|men&s;e
advantage to him, who never had
more than one &s;olitary idea.</P>
<P>Among the regulations of this art, it
might not be improper to recommend
darkne&s;s. Several profound thinkers,
could never pur&s;ue the operations of
their minds, in the di&s;traction of light,
when the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of thought pro|duces
a new object, and an extraneous
<PB N="79" REF="101">
idea. Mallebranche and others, clo&s;ed
their &s;hutters when they wi&s;hed to ab|&s;tract
them&s;elves. That darkne&s;s is a
great aid to thinking, would appear from
what mo&s;t men experience relative to
their thoughts during the night. The
&s;ilence and ob&s;curity of that time are
mo&s;t friendly to ab&s;traction, and often
when &s;leep for&s;akes us, and we mu&s;e, our
thoughts &s;urpri&s;e by the vividne&s;s of
fancy. If at that moment, in the words
of one of our mo&s;t elegant poems, we
do not,
<Q>Snatch the faithle&s;s fugitives to light.
<BIBL>Plea&s;ures of Memory.</BIBL></Q>
If Memory does not chain the children
of Imagination, they are &s;cattered, and
fly the beams of the morning. Our mind,
among a tumultuous croud, &s;uddenly
finds it&s;elf for&s;aken and &s;olitary. It is at
that unregarded period of our exi&s;tence,
<PB N="80" REF="102">
that men of moderate capacities feel an
extraordinary expan&s;ion, and men of
genius &s;ome of their mo&s;t original com|binations.
Yet then, how few, like Pope,
have an old woman at hand, to bring
pens and paper!</P>
<P>Men of genius mu&s;t con&s;ider them|&s;elves
as &s;o many vigilant guardians of
the infinity of nature. So treacherous is
Recollection, and &s;o capriciou&s;ly does
Memory &s;upply her trea&s;ures to Fancy,
that &s;ome of the happie&s;t conceptions of
genius are fortuitous; they come, we do
not know from where, and &s;pring we
do not know how; but if not &s;ei&s;ed at
the moment of perception, they are like
autumnal clouds, who&s;e romantic figures
di&s;&s;olve, as we gaze.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that collections have been
made, &s;mall ones no doubt, of bon mots
by per&s;ons who never &s;aid but one good
thing; it would form no incurious mi&s;|cellany,
<PB N="81" REF="103">
if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;elect &s;ome
of tho&s;e thoughts of great thinkers,
which were never written. We &s;hould
find many admirable ones. The painters
have this advantage over writers, their
&s;lighte&s;t &s;ketches are immediately &s;ie&s;ed,
and become as valuable to po&s;terity as
their more complete labours.</P>
<P>The ART OF MEDITATION is an art
which we may ince&s;&s;antly exerci&s;e, and
need not remit for long intervals of re|po&s;e,
as every other art. And yet, not|with&s;tanding
the facility of practice, and
we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the hourly &s;kill we
might obtain, every manual art, is
brought to perfection, while of the art
of the mind, millions are yet ignorant
of the fir&s;t rudiments. Quintilian finely
ob&s;erves, that men of genius command
it at all times, and in all places. In
their walks, at table, and at a&s;&s;emblies,
they turn their eye inwards, and can
<PB N="82" REF="104">
form an artificial &s;olitude. The powers
of ab&s;traction, which &s;ome men have
exerci&s;ed, appear to puny thinkers to
have &s;omething of the marvellous; in
the regions of the mind, they look like
&s;o many Gullivers among a million of
Lilliputians. Of Socrates it is &s;aid, that
he would frequently remain an entire day
and night in the &s;ame attitude, ab&s;orbed
in meditation; and why &s;hall we doubt
this when we know that La Fontaine
and Thom&s;on, De&s;cartes and Newton,
experienced the &s;ame ab&s;traction? In
Cicero's Treati&s;e on Old Age, Cato
prai&s;es Caius Sulpitius Gallus, who,
when he &s;at down to write in the morn|ing,
was &s;urpri&s;ed by the evening, and
when he took up his pen in the evening,
was &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of the
morning. Of the Italian poet Marini,
it is &s;aid, that he was once &s;o ab&s;orbed
in the revi&s;ion of his Adonis, that he
<PB N="83" REF="105">
&s;uffered his leg to be burnt, for &s;ome
time, without any &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>This enthu&s;ia&s;m renders every thing
that &s;urrounds us as di&s;tant as if an im|men&s;e
interval &s;eparated us from the
&s;cene. It is related of a modern a&s;tro|nomer,
that one &s;ummer night when he
was withdrawing to his chamber, the
brightne&s;s of the heavens &s;hewed a phe|nomenon.
He pa&s;&s;ed the whole night in
ob&s;erving it, and when they came to
him early in the morning and found him
in the &s;ame attitude, he &s;aid, like one
who had been recollecting his thoughts
for a few moments, <Q REND="inline">it mu&s;t be thus;
but I'll go to bed before 'tis late.</Q> He
had gazed the entire night in meditation
and did not know it.</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is active genius,
pre&s;ents an object more &s;ingular than
genius in it's quie&s;cent meditations. The
flowing &s;tream is lo&s;t in an ocean rolling
<PB N="84" REF="106">
impetuou&s;ly. This phrenzy of ab&s;trac|tion,
and wonderful agitation of the
&s;oul, is required not only in the fine arts,
but wherever a great exertion mu&s;t be
employed. It was felt by Gray in his
loftie&s;t excur&s;ions; and is it not the
&s;ame power which impels the villager,
when to a&s;toni&s;h his rivals, in a conte&s;t
for leaping, he retires back &s;ome &s;teps,
ferments his mind to a fervent re&s;olu|tion,
and clears the eventful bound? It
was a maxim with one of our ancient and
great Admirals, in the reign of Eliza|beth,
that a height of pa&s;&s;ion, amounting
to phrenzy, was nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a
man for that place. A variety of in|&s;tances
might be given of this fine en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
which has ever accompanied
the arti&s;t, at the moment he produced
excellencies.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes ari&s;en into a delirium.
The &s;oul of Rou&s;&s;eau was bewildered in
<PB N="85" REF="107">
the delu&s;ions of fancy, and the momen|tary
di&s;po&s;itions of his mind coloured
exterior objects. Petrarch in that mi|nute
narrative of a vi&s;ion in which Laura
appeared to him, and Ta&s;&s;o in the con|ver&s;ations
with his invi&s;ible &s;pirit, ex|panded
their &s;ublime imaginations to a
dangerous phrenzy. This delicious ine|briation
of the heart, occa&s;ions &s;o inten&s;e
a delight, that to de&s;cribe this character
of the &s;oul, requires, what one of the&s;e
exqui&s;ite minds has called
<Q>Thoughts that breathe and words that burn!</Q>
The ancients &s;aw nothing &s;hort of a di|vine
in&s;piration in this agitation of the
mind. It affects men of genius phy&s;i|cally.
Fielding &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">I do not doubt
but that the mo&s;t pathetic and affecting
&s;cenes have been writ with tears!</Q>
He, perhaps, would have been plea&s;ed
to have confirmed his ob&s;ervation, by
<PB N="86" REF="108">
the following circum&s;tance. Meta&s;ta&s;io
has written a beautiful Sonnet, on occa|&s;ion
of having &s;hed tears in writing an
Opera.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Sonnet &s;hall be given at the clo&s;e of the volume.</NOTE> When the fir&s;t idea of the
E&s;&s;ay on the Arts and Sciences ru&s;hed
on the contemplation of Rou&s;&s;eau, it oc|ca&s;ioned
&s;uch a fever of the mind, and
trembling of his frame, that it ap|proached
to a delirium. The tremors
of Dryden, after having written an Ode,
(a circum&s;tance accidentally handed to
us by tradition) were probably not un|u&s;ual
with him.</P>
<P>Chance has pre&s;erved but a few of
&s;imilar in&s;tances; this enthu&s;ia&s;m, in|deed,
can only be ob&s;erved by men of
genius them&s;elves; but when it mo&s;t
powerfully agitates them, they can lea&s;t
perceive it. At that moment of exqui|&s;ite
extravagance, like a religious vi&s;i|onary,
they pierce into "the heaven of
<PB N="87" REF="109">
heavens," and when they return to
their chair and their table, the effect has
cea&s;ed, and the golden hour of &s;ublime
rapture mu&s;t terminate like other hours,
in vulgar appetites that offend Fancy
and gratify Nature.</P>
<P>This irritability of mind has &s;ome|times
rendered &s;ociety di&s;plea&s;ing to &s;e|veral
men of genius. Whenever Rou&s;&s;eau
pa&s;&s;ed a morning in company, he &s;ays,
it was ob&s;erved that in the evening he
was di&s;&s;atisfied and di&s;turbed. Rou&s;&s;eau
may be con&s;idered by &s;ome, as a mind
too peculiar, to be taken as a guide in
our examination into the character of
men of genius. If our young authors,
however, would meditate on certain
parts of his character, their virtues might
be more elevated, and their &s;tyle more
exqui&s;ite, than the model which any
other literary character of this age pre|&s;ents
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="110">
Ab&s;orbed in his meditations, the man
of genius lives in one continued &s;eries of
reflection; always him&s;elf, &s;eldom ano|ther;
frequently the real arti&s;t loves
nothing but his art, and his very amu&s;e|ments
and relaxations receive the im|pre&s;&s;ion
of this enthu&s;ia&s;m. Not without
an apparent haughtine&s;s, which often is
but the natural and dignified expre&s;&s;ion
of an elevated mind; and he appears
awkward or ignorant of tho&s;e petty at|tentions
which form the &s;cience of tho&s;e
who have no &s;cience. A great Prince&s;s
was de&s;irous of &s;eeing one of the fir&s;t
Literary Characters of the age; her di&s;|appointment
was inconceivable; he &s;at
awkwardly and &s;ilently on his chair, and
made the mo&s;t perplexed bow, &s;he had
yet &s;een.</P>
<P>We often view the man of real genius
in&s;ulated in a brilliant circle; while the
intriguing and fa&s;hionable author, who&s;e
<PB N="89" REF="111">
heart is more corrupt than his head, is
admired becau&s;e he has di&s;covered the
art of admiring. The triflers con&s;ider
him to be a man of genius; he employs
their own ideas; both are therefore
gratified.</P>
<P>It is however certain, that this ab|&s;traction
and awkwardne&s;s which render
a man of genius ridiculous and incon|&s;iderable
in the private circle, are the
cau&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;s with the public.
Often his private defects are the &s;ource
of his public qualities; his bluntne&s;s may
be a lively perception of truth; his cold|ne&s;s
a rigid candour; his tedious di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
may be an accuracy of rea&s;oning,
and his di&s;agreeable warmth the ardour
which animates his works with the pub|lic.
It was the exce&s;&s;ive vanity and
&s;elf-love of Cicero and Voltaire, that gave
birth to all their va&s;t de&s;igns. To plea&s;e
the public, and his circle is incompa|tible
<PB N="90" REF="112">
&mdash;to this the frivolous will not a&s;&s;ent&mdash;when of their numerous body one ac|compli&s;hed
trifler &s;hall be acknowledged
as a great genius, this ob&s;ervation &s;hall
be deemed erroneous. But to clo&s;e a
di&s;pute of the mo&s;t ancient date, I &s;hall
quote the remark of a <HI>Lord.</HI> Shafte&s;|bury
(for nobility lo&s;es it's title and often
it's rank in the republic of letters) has
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">that it may happen that a per&s;on
may be &s;o much the wor&s;e author for
being the finer gentleman.</Q></P>
<P>Many rea&s;ons may be alledged why
genius is defective in ordinary conver|&s;ation;
one may be &s;ufficient; the want
of analogous ideas. The &s;pirit of fa&s;hi|onable
&s;ociety and that of &s;tudy, are in|compatible.
The language of the polite&s;t
circle may be defined the art of &s;peaking
idly to an idler. To &s;peak idly, is not an
acquirement of facility. A man of ge|nius
is rarely ver&s;ant in the fa&s;hionable
<PB N="91" REF="113">
vocabulary, and in a dialogue of elegant
inanity, which &s;hould be rapid and
various, he he&s;itates to find a remote
idea, and &s;tops to correct an imperfect
expre&s;&s;ion. How often will it be fortu|nate
for him if he e&s;capes being un|der&s;tood!
It is rather &s;ingular that our
poli&s;hed &s;ociety &s;hould bear &s;o clo&s;e a
re&s;emblance to the conver&s;ations of the
Hottentots&mdash;of the Hottentots?&mdash;Yes!
for we are told that they con&s;ider <HI>think|ing</HI>
as the &s;courge of human nature.</P>
<P>The refined &s;en&s;ibility of men of ge|nius,
renders them unea&s;y companions.
They di&s;cover a character too early, and
too &s;agaciou&s;ly, for the intere&s;ts of con|ver&s;ation.
Dunces are excellent com|panions
for dunces; the &s;ame ideas, and
the &s;ame judgments; the opacity of the
intellect is no detriment, for, like the
blind, they can perform their &s;tated
rounds in the night without incon|venience.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="114">
A man of genius can rarely be a fa|vourite
with &s;uch a party, even if they
&s;hould have &s;ome ta&s;te and &s;ome infor|mation.
His works they applaud, be|cau&s;e
that is fa&s;hionable, but they neg|lect
the author, who may happen to be
very unfa&s;hionable.</P>
<P>The frivoli&s;t author will be the even|ing
favourite; he &s;ports not without
grace on the brilliant &s;urface of the &s;oul;
but is irrecoverably lo&s;t when he pa&s;&s;es
over it's depths; the &s;wan that grace|fully
glides down rivers, would peri&s;h on
&s;eas. The man of genius &s;its like a me|lancholy
eagle who&s;e pinions are clip|ped,
and who is placed to roo&s;t among
dome&s;tic fowls.</P>
<P>A man of genius utters many things
in conver&s;ation which appear extrava|gant
or ab&s;urd; when printed they are
found admirable. How often the public
differs from the individual; there may
<PB N="93" REF="115">
be a century's opinion betwixt them.
This reflection reminds me of an Athe|nian
anecdote. A &s;tatuary at Athens,
made a figure of Minerva. Tho&s;e friends
who were admitted into his &s;hop (an
ancient cu&s;tom the moderns pre&s;erve)
were &s;urpri&s;ed at it's rough &s;trokes and
colo&s;&s;al features. Before the arti&s;t they
trembled for him; behind him they ca|lumniated.
The man of genius &s;miled
at the one, and forgave the other. When
the figure was fixed in a public place,
and in&s;pected by the city, and not merely
by individuals, the attic judges admired
the &s;oftne&s;s of the traits, and the maje&s;ty
of the figure. We mu&s;t never forget
that there is a certain di&s;tance, at which
opinions, as well as &s;tatues, are to be
viewed; and he who addre&s;&s;es an attic
public, knows, that it's enlightened &s;en|timents,
are rarely to be found in a pri|vate
circle.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="116">
It is not nece&s;&s;ary to produce in&s;tances
of the deficiencies of men of genius in
conver&s;ation. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve,
that the &s;ublime Dante was taciturn or
&s;atirical; Addi&s;on and Moliere were
&s;ilent; Corneille and Dryden were no
amu&s;ing companions. Vaucan&s;on was
&s;aid to be as much a machine as any he
made.</P>
<P>To the intimates of the&s;e &s;uperior men,
who complained of their defects, I would
thus have replied&mdash;Do their productions
not delight and &s;urpri&s;e you?&mdash;You are
&s;ilent; I beg your pardon. The <HI>public</HI>
has informed you of a great name; you
would not otherwi&s;e have perceived the
precious talent of your neighbour.&mdash;You
have examined his compo&s;itions; and
would you have him re&s;emble <HI>your&s;elves?</HI>
You know nothing of your friend but his
<HI>name.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="117">
A man of genius may, however, be
rendered the mo&s;t agreeable companion.
Few arti&s;ts but are eloquent on the art
in which they excel. He is an exqui&s;ite
in&s;trument if the hand of the performer

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Men of Genius limited in their Art.</HEAD>
<P>WE have examined in the preceding
Chapter &s;everal rea&s;ons why men of ge|nius
are often incapable of plea&s;ing in
the ver&s;atile conver&s;ation of a mixed &s;o|ciety.
Another ob&s;ervation offers; their
powers of plea&s;ing are even limited in
the art in which they excel. They are
confined (&s;ays Du Bos) to particular
branches in that art.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation, reiterated without
effect, has become trite, while it would
appear by mo&s;t authors, con&s;idering
them&s;elves univer&s;al geniu&s;es, that it was
on the contrary, a dangerous novelty.
Literary hi&s;tory continually confirms it's
verity; and the&s;e failures of eminent men
are &s;o many in&s;tructions which Nature
dictates; but her pupils receive her ad|monitions
with contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="119">
Nature is "a jealous God," and &s;eve|ral
of our great writers when they have
ri&s;en in rebellion again&s;t her, have only
&s;uffered by the violation. Fielding, ex|cellent
in his novels, when his aid was
required for the theatre, could never
write a tolerable drama. Congreve, ce|lebrated
for his pointed wit, when he
took up the reigning topic, wrote the
feeble&s;t ver&s;e; Rowe, &s;ucce&s;sful in the
&s;oft tones of tragedy, is remarkable for
a mi&s;erable failure in comedy; La Fon|taine,
that exqui&s;ite fabuli&s;t, found that
his opera was hi&s;&s;ed. The ab&s;urdities of
Voltaire, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful of univer&s;al
writers, are only forgiven for his inex|hau&s;tible
wit and happy irony.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t original genius of our age,
with di&s;cernment equal to his wit, con|fines
him&s;elf to that &s;pecies of poetry in
which he can fear no rival. Songs, more
delicious than the odes of Anacreon, and
<PB N="98" REF="120">
&s;atires, more pungent than tho&s;e of
Horace; compo&s;itions more admirable
than imitable; the&s;e are the limits which,
like a great politician, he draws round
his empire. He has no di&s;po&s;ition to
rival Milton in an epic, or Shake&s;peare
in a tragedy. Peter Pindar will never,
therefore, experience the fate of Louis
the Great; to make brilliant conque&s;ts
in the prime of life, and view his repu|tation
die before him&s;elf, by a vain at|tempt
at univer&s;al monarchy.</P>
<P>But &s;ome ingenious men are willing to
oppo&s;e this precept, and pre&s;ume to
think that Nature is never ungrateful,
when &s;he receives the proper attentions.
It is not difficult to find &s;ome ingenious
arti&s;ts, who &s;hew abilities in various
modes of compo&s;ition; but to evince
<HI>abilities,</HI> and to di&s;play <HI>genius,</HI> are re|moved
at a long interval from each other.
True genius has rarely this &s;upplene&s;s;
<PB N="99" REF="121">
but what the French call <HI>le bel e&s;prit,</HI>
has it often in a wonderful degree. Wri|ters
endowed with the <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> can
compo&s;e hi&s;tory and romance, and moral
and poetical e&s;&s;ays, with the &s;ame in|genuity.
A man of genius will only write
a hi&s;tory, or a romance; moral, or poe|tical
e&s;&s;ays; but his performances remain
with the language, while the reputation
of a <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> like &s;ome artificial fires,
become &s;uddenly extinct. And it is cu|rious
to ob&s;erve, that the very ingenious
Du Clos is denied by the French critics,
to be a man of genius, becau&s;e he wrote
equally well on a variety of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;urpri&s;ing that even a man of
genius &s;hould fail in pre&s;erving an equal
power over every province of his art; the
genius of man being nece&s;&s;arily limited
compared to art it&s;elf; and he who rai&s;es
admiration by his &s;kill in one depart|ment,
will never equal his faculty in an|other.
<PB N="100" REF="122">
He who <HI>excels,</HI> like a Butler in
wit and &s;atire, will find it impo&s;&s;ible to
<HI>excel</HI> like a Milton, in &s;entiment and

mu&s;ician <HI>excelled</HI> as a &s;tatuary. But it
is not difficult to prove, that the mo&s;t
eminent men of genius have found their
talent confined to their art, and even to
departments of their art.</P>
<P>The ancients therefore wi&s;ely addicted
them&s;elves only to one &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition.
The poet was not an hi&s;torian,
nor the hi&s;torian a poet; but the poet
was a poet, and the hi&s;torian an hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>I have been induced to touch on this
critical admonition, becau&s;e it is &s;ome|times
denied; and I think the error
<PB N="101" REF="123">
ari&s;es from not di&s;tingui&s;hing the grand
compo&s;itions of genius, from the pretty
curio&s;ities of the <HI>bel e&s;prit,</HI> which may
be defined mimetic genius. Whenever

<P>He who writes on topics of different
&s;pecies, cannot meditate much on any;
with him all is a beautiful di&s;traction
rather than an accompli&s;hed beauty; he
can only repeat what has been already
given, or give what will not merit to be
repeated. Writers of mediocrity, by a
long and patient devotion to <HI>one kind</HI> of
compo&s;ition, have often attained con|&s;iderable
merit; but how much more

act on a mind of original powers. We

may compare tho&s;e who write on dif|ferent
arts, or multifarious topics, to
excur&s;ive merchants, who make &s;mall

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Some Ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the Infirmities
and Defects of Men of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE modes of life of a man of genius
are often tinctured with eccentricity and
enthu&s;ia&s;m. The&s;e are in an eternal con|flict
with the u&s;ages of common life. His
occupations, his amu&s;ements, and his
ardour, are di&s;cordant to daily pur&s;uits,
and prudential habits. It is the charac|teri&s;tic
of genius to di&s;play no talent to
ordinary men; and it is unju&s;t to cen|&s;ure
the latter when they con&s;ider him
as born for no human purpo&s;e. Their
plea&s;ures and their &s;orrows are not his
plea&s;ures and his &s;orrows. He often ap|pears
to &s;lumber in di&s;honourable ea&s;e,
while his days are pa&s;&s;ed in labours, more
con&s;tant and more painful than tho&s;e of
<PB N="104" REF="126">
the manufacturer. The world are not
always aware that to meditate, to com|po&s;e,
and even to conver&s;e with &s;ome,
are great labours; and as Hawke&s;worth
ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">wearine&s;s may be con|tracted
in an arm chair.</Q></P>
<P>Such men are al&s;o cen&s;ured for an ir|ritability
of di&s;po&s;ition. Many rea&s;ons
might apologize for the&s;e unhappy vari|ations
of humour. The occupation of
making a great name, is, perhaps, more
anxious and precarious than that of
making a great fortune. We &s;ympathi&s;e
with the merchant when he communi|cates
melancholy to the &s;ocial circle in
con&s;equence of a bankruptcy, or when
he feels the elation of pro&s;perity at the
&s;ucce&s;s of a va&s;t &s;peculation. The au|thor
is not le&s;s immer&s;ed in cares, or
agitated by &s;ucce&s;s, for literature has it's
bankruptcies and it's &s;peculations.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="127">
The anxieties and di&s;appointments of
an author, even of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful,
are incalculable. If he is learned, learn|ing
is the torment of unquenchable thir&s;t,
and his elaborate work is expo&s;ed to the
accidental recollection of an inferior
mind, as well as the fatal omi&s;&s;ions of
wearied vigilance. If he excels in the
magic of diction, and the graces of
fancy, his path is &s;trewed with ro&s;es,
but his feet bleed on invi&s;ible yet piercing
thorns. Rou&s;&s;eau has given a glowing
de&s;cription of the cea&s;ele&s;s inquietudes
by which he acquired &s;kill in the arts of
compo&s;ition; and has &s;aid, that with
whatever talent a man may be born, the
art of writing is not ea&s;ily obtained. The
depre&s;&s;ions and elevations of genius, are
de&s;cribed by Pope
<Q><L>Who pants for glory finds but &s;hort repo&s;e,</L>
<L>A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128">
The anxious uncertainty of an author
for his compo&s;itions, is like the &s;tate of
the lover who writes to his mi&s;tre&s;s; he
repents, and thinks he has written too
much, and he recollects that he had
omitted things of the greate&s;t moment.
When, indeed, his work is received with
favour, he re&s;embles Latona, as de&s;cribed
by Ovid, who contemplated with &s;ecret
joy, her daughter Diana, di&s;tingui&s;hed
among the wood-nymphs, and who&s;c
appearance was taller, and more lovely
than her companions.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by M. La Harpe (an
author by profe&s;&s;ion) that as it has been
proved there are &s;ome maladies peculiar
to arti&s;ts, there are al&s;o &s;orrows which
are peculiar to them; and which the
world can neither pity nor &s;often, be|cau&s;e
it cannot have their conceptions.
We read not without a melancholy emo|tion,
the querulous expre&s;&s;ions of men of
<PB N="107" REF="129">
genius. We have a little catalogue <HI>de
calamitate Litteratorum</HI>; we might add a
volume by the addition of mo&s;t of our
own authors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The materials are ready for publication; but the hope of it's utility has pa&s;t, &s;ince a <HI>Literary</HI> Fund e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in attic London found too many claimants and too few &s;ub&s;cribers. It has died away; while the <HI>Mu|&s;ical</HI> Fund is patroni&s;ed by the Great, which &s;eems to prove that they have finer ears than under&s;tandings.</NOTE> The too &s;en&s;ible Smollet
has left this te&s;timonial to po&s;terity of his
feelings. In one of his prefaces he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline">had &s;ome of tho&s;e who were plea&s;ed to
call them&s;elves my friends, been at any
pains to de&s;erve the character, and told
me ingenuou&s;ly what I had to expect
in the capacity of an <HI>Author,</HI> I &s;hould
in all probability have &s;pared my&s;elf
the <HI>incredible labour</HI> and <HI>chagrin</HI> I have
&s;ince undergone.</Q> This is a text
which requires no commentary. Hume
has given the hi&s;tory of his writings, and
we find that it required to the full, all
<PB N="108" REF="130">
his patient philo&s;ophy to &s;upport his ill
reception. The rea&s;oning Hume pro|po&s;ed
changing his name and his coun|try.
Parties are formed again&s;t a man
of genius, as happened to Corneille and
Milton; and a Pradon and a Settle are
preferred to a Racine and a Dryden.
What mu&s;t have been the agonies of the
neglected Collins when he burnt his ex|qui&s;ite
odes at the door of his publi&s;her!
The great Bacon bequeathed his name
and his works to foreigners, and to a fu|ture
age; nor mu&s;t we forget the dig|nified
complaints of the Rambler, with
which he awefully clo&s;es his work in ap|pealing
to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The votaries of the arts and &s;ciencies,
are called by Cicero, Heroes of Peace;
their labours, their dangers, and their
intrepidity, make them heroes; but
peace is rarely the ornament of their fe|veri&s;h
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="131">
It is a mortification experienced by
&s;everal men of genius, that they have
never acquired that reputation they might
have merited, by not having been en|abled
to carry their genius to it's per|fection.
A variety of circum&s;tances may
hinder &s;uch a writer from occupying the
di&s;tingui&s;hed place his abilities promi&s;ed.
Some authors, of the fir&s;t-rate genius,
are neglected, becau&s;e deficient in that
ta&s;te, which is alone attained by long
culture and an enlarged education. Piron
was a writer of as great genius, and ori|ginal
powers, as any of the French poets;
but he has failed of &s;ecuring him&s;elf a
&s;eat among the ma&s;ters of the French
Parna&s;&s;us. He has him&s;elf, in &s;ome
&s;ketches of his life, a&s;&s;igned the rea&s;ons
of this failure; till the age of twenty-five,
he was confined to the narrow
circle of unlettered friends; he pa&s;&s;ed
ten or twelve years afterwards at Paris in
<PB N="110" REF="132">
ob&s;curity; &s;o that he was about forty,
when by the advice of Crebillon, he e&s;|&s;ayed
his powers on his fa&s;tidious the|atre,
and though he has evinced high
genius, he has only &s;atisfied his refined
nation by one performance.</P>
<P>Some are now only agreeable, who
might have been great writers, had their
application to &s;tudy, and the modes of
their life been different. In Mr. Greaves'
lively recollections of his friend Shen|&s;tone,
are &s;ome judicious ob&s;ervations on
this &s;ubject. He has drawn a compari|&s;on
between the elevated abilities of Gray,
and the humble talents of Shen&s;tone;
and he has e&s;&s;ayed to &s;hew, that it was
the accidental circum&s;tances of Gray's
place of birth, education, his admittance
into &s;ome of the be&s;t circles, and his
a&s;&s;iduous application to &s;cience, which
gave him that &s;uperiority over the indo|lence,
the retirement, and the inertion
<PB N="111" REF="133">
of a want of patronage, which made
Shen&s;tone, as Gray familiarly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">hop
round his walks</Q> like a bird in a &s;tring.
I mu&s;t again remind the reader of an|other
apparent paradox of Helvetius,
who &s;ays, that it is the different modes
of education which influence men &s;o
wonderfully; and that <HI>genius</HI> may be <HI>ac|quired</HI>
whenever a proper &s;tudy is accom|panied
by a fervent pa&s;&s;ion for any par|ticular
art or &s;cience. This fervent pa&s;|&s;ion
may be only another name for what
is called genius. I believe, however, that
Shen&s;tone, who now occupies a &s;ubordi|nate
&s;eat, in the Temple of Fame, might
have been placed among the higher
cla&s;&s;es. Perhaps mo&s;t men are born
with abilities nearly equal; and Mr.
Greaves has more rea&s;on on his &s;ide than
&s;ome may be aware, when he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">of
two per&s;ons, born to equal fortune, if
one improves his &s;tock by indu&s;try
<PB N="112" REF="134">
and traffic, and the other lives idly
upon the principal, the con&s;equence is
obvious.</Q></P>
<P>Others, by an ignorance of a fine
manner, or by a wrong direction long
pur&s;ued, wa&s;te their talents, on the hum|bler
departments of art, when they have
&s;ufficient genius to excel in the highe&s;t.
This is the ca&s;e among many of our
provincial writers, who, with no incon|&s;iderable
talents, are placed often in &s;itu|ations
where they &s;tudy authors who&s;e
ta&s;te is &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the more modern.
We often &s;ee ingenious writers, who are
about half a century removed from the
public ta&s;te. Among the painters, Al|bert
Durer may &s;erve as an in&s;tance.
Va&s;ari (quoted by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds)
ju&s;tly remarked, that he would have pro|bably
been one of the fir&s;t painters of
his age, had he been initiated into the
great principles of the art, &s;o well un|der&s;tood
<PB N="113" REF="135">
by his Italian contemporaries.
And Sir Jo&s;hua adds, but unluckily hav|ing
never &s;een or heard of any other
manner, he con&s;idered his own, with|out
doubt, as perfect.</P>
<P>Men of genius are often reverenced
only where they are known by their wri|tings.
In the romance of life they are
divinities, in it's hi&s;tory they are men.
From errors of the mind, and derelic|tions
of the heart, they may not be ex|empt;
the&s;e are perceived by their
acquaintance, who can often di&s;cern only
the&s;e qualities. The defects of great
men are the con&s;olation of the dunces.</P>
<P>Degrading vices and &s;ingular follies
have di&s;honoured men of the highe&s;t
genius. Than others, their pa&s;&s;ions are
more efferve&s;cent, and their reli&s;h for
enjoyment more keen. Genius is a pe|rilous
gift of Nature; for it is acknow|ledged
that the &s;ame materials &s;he em|ploys
<PB N="114" REF="136">
to form a Cataline and a Cromwell,
make a Cicero and a Bacon. Plato, in
his vi&s;ionary &s;ketches of a man of genius,
lays great &s;tre&s;s on his having the mo&s;t
violent pa&s;&s;ions, with rea&s;on to re&s;train
them. Helvetius, an accurate ob&s;erver
of men of genius, al&s;o enforces the idea
of their inflammable and phy&s;ical pa&s;&s;i|ons.
Glory and infamy is the &s;ame
violent pa&s;&s;ion, but the direction is dif|ferent,
and Voltaire has expre&s;&s;ed this
in one ver&s;e,<Q>Si Je n'etois Ce&s;ar, j'aurois et&egrave; Brutus.</Q> Genius, like a &s;torm of wind in Arabia,
either directs the myriads of locu&s;ts to
the land, or with a friendly influence di&s;|per&s;es
them away.</P>
<P>For their foibles it appears more dif|ficult
to account than for their vices; for
a violent pa&s;&s;ion depends on it's direction
to become either excellence or depra|vity;
but why their exalted mind &s;hould
<PB N="115" REF="137">
not pre&s;erve them from the imbecillities
of fools, appears a mere caprice of Na|ture.
A curious li&s;t might be formed of
<Q>Fears of the brave and follies of the wi&s;e.
<BIBL>John&s;on.</BIBL></Q>
In the note underneath I have thrown to|gether
a few facts which may be pa&s;&s;ed
over by tho&s;e who have no ta&s;te for
literary anecdotes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voiture was the &s;on of a vintner, and like our Prior, was &s;o mortified whenever reminded of his ori|ginal occupation, that it was &s;aid of him, that wine which cheared the heart of all men, &s;ickened that of Voiture. Rou&s;&s;eau, the poet, was the &s;on of a cobler; and when his hone&s;t parent waited at the door of the theatre, to embrace his &s;on on the &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t piece, the inhuman poet repul&s;ed the venerable father with in&s;ult and contempt. Aken&s;ide ever con&s;idered his lamene&s;s as an un&s;upportable misfortune, &s;ince it continually reminded him of his origin, being occa&s;i|oned by the fall of a cleaver from one of his father's blocks, a re&s;pectable butcher. Milton delighted in contemplating his own per&s;on, and the engraver not having reached our &s;ublime Bard's "ideal grace," he has pointed his indignation in four iambics. Among the complaints of Pope, is that of "the pictured &s;hape." Even the &s;trong-minded John&s;on would not be painted "blinking Sam." Mr. Bo&s;well tells us that Gold&s;mith attempted to &s;hew his agility to be &s;uperior to the dancing of an ape, who&s;e prai&s;e had occa&s;ioned him a fit of jealou&s;y, but he failed in imitating his rival. The in&s;cription under Boileau's portrait, de&s;cribing his character with lavi&s;h panegyric, and a preference to Juvenal and Horace, is unfortu|nately known to have been written by him&s;elf.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="138">
But it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to acknowledge,
that men of genius are often unju&s;tly re|proached
with foibles. The &s;ports of a
vacant mind, are mi&s;under&s;tood as fol|lies.
The &s;implicity of truth may ap|pear
vanity, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
&s;uperiority, envy. Nothing is more u&s;ual
than our &s;urpri&s;e at &s;ome great writer or
arti&s;t contemning the labours of another,
whom the public cheri&s;h with equal ap|probation.
We place it to the account of
his envy, but perhaps this opinion is
erroneous, and claims a conci&s;e inve&s;ti|gation.</P>
<P>Every &s;uperior writer has a MANNER of
his own, with which he has long been
<PB N="117" REF="139">
conver&s;ant, and too often inclines to
judge of the merit of a performance by
the degree it attains of his favourite
manner. He errs, becau&s;e impartial men
of ta&s;te are addicted to no manner, but
love whatever is exqui&s;ite. We often
&s;ee readers draw their degree of compa|rative
merit from the manner of their
favourite author; an author does the
&s;ame; that is, he draws it from him&s;elf.
Such a partial &s;tandard of ta&s;te is erro|neous;
but it is more excu&s;eable in the
author, than in the reader.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation will &s;erve to explain
&s;everal curious phenomena in literature.
The witty Cowley de&s;pi&s;ed the natural
Chaucer; the cla&s;&s;ical Boileau, the rough
&s;ublimity of Crebillon; the forcible Cor|neille,
the tender Racine; the affected
Marivaux, the familiar Moliere; the ar|tificial
Gray, the &s;imple Shen&s;tone. Each
alike judged by that peculiar manner
<PB N="118" REF="140">
he had long formed. In a free conver|&s;ation
they might have contemned each
other; and a dunce, who had li&s;tened
without ta&s;te or under&s;tanding, if he had
been a haberda&s;her in anecdotes, would
have ha&s;tened to repo&s;it in his ware|room
of literary fal&s;ities, a long decla|mation
on the vanity and envy of the&s;e
great men.</P>
<P>But the charge of vanity has been
urged with great appearance of truth
again&s;t authors, for the complacence they
experience in their works, and the high
admiration of them&s;elves. An author is
pictured as a Narci&s;&s;us.</P>
<P>It has long been acknowledged that
every work of merit, the more it is ex|amined,
the greater the merit will ap|pear.
The mo&s;t ma&s;terly touches, and
the re&s;erved graces, which form the
pride of the arti&s;t, are not ob&s;ervable till
after a familiar and con&s;tant meditation.
<PB N="119" REF="141">
What is mo&s;t refined is lea&s;t obvious;
and to &s;ome mu&s;t remain unperceived
for ever. Churchill, in the opening of
his &s;econd book of Gotham, ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves,
that to form the beauties of
compo&s;ition,
<Q><L>&mdash;few can do, and &s;carcely one,</L>
<L>One critic in an age can find when done.</L></Q></P>
<P>But a&s;cending from the&s;e elaborate
&s;trokes in compo&s;ition, to the views and
de&s;igns of an author, the more profound
and exten&s;ive the&s;e are, the more they
elude the reader's apprehen&s;ion. I re|fine
not too much when I &s;ay, that the
author is con&s;cious of <HI>beauties,</HI> that <HI>are
not in his compo&s;ition.</HI> The happie&s;t wri|ters
are compelled to &s;ee &s;ome of their
mo&s;t magnificent ideas float along the
immen&s;ity of mind, beyond the feeble
gra&s;p of expre&s;&s;ion. Compare the &s;tate
of the author with that of the reader;
how copious and overflowing is the mind
<PB N="120" REF="142">
of the one to the other; how more &s;en|&s;ibly
alive to a variety of exqui&s;ite &s;trokes
which the other has not yet perceived;
the author is familiar with every part,
and the reader has but a vague notion of
the whole. How many noble conceptions
of Rou&s;&s;eau are not yet ma&s;tered! How
many profound reflections of Monte&s;quieu
are not yet under&s;tood! How many &s;ub|tile
le&s;&s;ons are yet in Locke, which no
preceptor can teach!</P>
<P>Such, among others, are the rea&s;ons
which may induce an author to expre&s;s
him&s;elf in language which may &s;ound
like vanity. To be admired, is the noble
&s;implicity of the ancients, (imitated by a
few elevated minds among the moderns)
in expre&s;&s;ing with ardour the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of genius. We are not more di&s;|plea&s;ed
with Dryden than with Cicero,
when he acquaints us of the great things
he has done, and tho&s;e he purpo&s;es to
<PB N="121" REF="143">
do. Modern mode&s;ty might, perhaps,
to &s;ome be more engaging, if it were
mode&s;ty; but our artificial blu&s;hes are
like the ladies' temporary rouge, ever
ready to colour the face on any occa&s;ion.
Some will not place their names to their
books, yet prefix it to their adverti&s;e|ments;
others pretend to be the editors
of their own works; &s;ome compliment
them&s;elves in the third per&s;on; and
many, concealed under the &s;hade of ano|nymous
critici&s;m, form panegyrics, as
elaborate and long as Pliny's on Trajan,
of their works and them&s;elves; yet in a
conver&s;ation, &s;tart at a compliment, and
quarrel at a quotation. Such mode&s;t au|thors
re&s;emble <HI>certain</HI> ladies, who in
<HI>public</HI> are equally celebrated for the
colde&s;t cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merit characteri&s;es
men of genius; but it is to be lamented
that the illu&s;ions of &s;elf-love, are not di&s;|tingui&s;hable
<PB N="122" REF="144">
from the realities of con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are in&s;tances. Epicurus wrote to a Mini&s;ter of State, <Q REND="inline">if you de&s;ire glory, nothing can be&s;tow it &s;o much as the letters I write to you.</Q> Seneca, in quoting the&s;e words, adds, <Q REND="inline">what Epi|curus promi&s;ed to his friend, that my Lucilius I promi&s;e you.</Q> The&s;e were great men. But one La Serre, a French writer of epi&s;tles, when he addre&s;|&s;ed them, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">I immortali&s;e you, Sir, and this merits at lea&s;t your gratitude.</Q> How many La Serres might we quote!</P></NOTE>
Yet if we were to take from
&s;ome their pride of exultation, we anni|hilate
the germ of their excellence. The
per&s;ua&s;ion of a ju&s;t po&s;terity &s;moothed
the &s;leeple&s;s pillow, and &s;pread a &s;un|&s;hine
in the &s;olitude of Bacon, Monte&s;|quieu,
and Newton; of Cervantes, Gray,
and Milton. Men of genius anticipate
their contemporaries, and know they are
&s;uch, long before the tardy con&s;ent of
the public.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o been accu&s;ed of the
meane&s;t adulations; it is certain that
many have had the weakne&s;s to prai&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="145">
unworthy men, and &s;ome the courage to
era&s;e what they have written. A young
writer unknown, yet langui&s;hing for en|couragement,
when he fir&s;t finds the
notice of a per&s;on of &s;ome eminence, has
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in language which gra|titude,
a finer rea&s;on than rea&s;on it&s;elf,

the &s;en&s;ations of this pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">the debt
immen&s;e of endle&s;s gratitude.</Q> Who
ever pays an "immen&s;e debt" in &s;mall
&s;ums?</P>
<P>Even extravagant applau&s;es may be
excu&s;ed. Every man of genius has left
&s;uch honourable traces of his private af|fections;
from Locke, who&s;e dedication of
his immortal treati&s;e is more adulative
than could be &s;uppo&s;ed from a temperate
philo&s;opher, to Churchill, who&s;e eulo|gies
on his friends form &s;o beautiful a
contra&s;t with the acerbity of his &s;atire.
As their &s;u&s;ceptibility is more ardent,
<PB N="124" REF="146">
and their penetration keener, than other
men, it is not improbable that they often
di&s;cover traits in the characters of tho&s;e
with whom they are familiar, unper|ceived
and unknown to the world. The
mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the ancients placed the
name of &s;ome friend at the head of their
works; we too often prefix the name of
&s;ome patron; but the mo&s;t graceful place
is, perhaps, in the mid&s;t of a work,
when a man of genius &s;hows that he is
not le&s;s mindful of his &s;ocial affection
than his fame.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Literary Friend&s;hips and Enmities.</HEAD>
<P>A DELIGHTFUL topic opens to our con|templation.
I enter the &s;cene, as Eneas
the green Ely&s;ium, where he viewed the
once illu&s;trious inhabitants of the earth
repo&s;ing in &s;ocial felicity. Among the
multitude, a Pythias and Damon are
rare; for friend&s;hip appears too &s;erious
for the frivolous, and too romantic for
the bu&s;y. The mutable pa&s;&s;ions of the
frivolous oblige them to for&s;ake tho&s;e
bo&s;oms in which they have repo&s;ited
their extinct pa&s;&s;ions; and the varying
object of the varying hour requires a new
&s;et of a&s;&s;ociates. The bu&s;y &s;uffer no in|timacies
to intrude on their private
views; the my&s;terious magnet of friend|&s;hip
is attached only by invi&s;ible atoms
<PB N="126" REF="148">
of &s;ympathy, but falls without cohe&s;ion,
on the &s;olidity of gold.</P>
<P>It is honourable to Literature, that
among the virtues it in&s;pires, is that of
ardent friend&s;hip, and it's hi&s;tory pre|&s;ents
no unfrequent in&s;tances of it's fine&s;t
enthu&s;ia&s;m. The delirium of love is
often too violent a pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;tudent,
and it's caprices are &s;till more incom|patible
with his pur&s;uits than it's deli|rium.
But friend&s;hip is not only delight|ful,
but nece&s;&s;ary to &s;oothe a mind alter|nately
elated and depre&s;&s;ed; when infirm,
it &s;trengthens, when dubious, it en|lightens,
when di&s;couraged, it animates.</P>
<P>That however it &s;hould be rare in
literature, will excite no &s;urpri&s;e. The
qualities nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute literary
friend&s;hip, compared with tho&s;e of men
of the world, mu&s;t render it's occa&s;ional
appearance a &s;ingularity. Literary friend|&s;hip
has no convivial gaieties or factious
<PB N="127" REF="149">
a&s;&s;emblies. Two atoms mu&s;t meet, out
of the va&s;t ma&s;s of nature, of &s;o equal a
form that when they once adhere, they
&s;hall appear as one, and re&s;i&s;t the utmo&s;t
force of &s;eparation. Their &s;tudies mu&s;t
be &s;imilar, and yet &s;o far from becoming
rivals, each mu&s;t find reciprocal a&s;&s;i&s;|tance;
when one of them is at length
found to excel, the other is to be the
protector of his fame. Each mu&s;t live
for the other, decide with one judgment,
and feel with one ta&s;te. In this inter|cour&s;e
of minds, the private pa&s;&s;ions are
not to be gratified, but often to be cor|rected,
and an energetic pa&s;&s;ion for &s;tudy
mu&s;t alone be indulged. In their fami|liar
conver&s;ations, learning is commu|nicated
without &s;tudy, and wit without
art. What is given by one is improved
by the other; fancy is enriched by me|mory:
and to &s;uch conver&s;ations the
world is indebted for many of it's hap|pie&s;t
<PB N="128" REF="150">
productions. The greate&s;t incon|venience
attending &s;uch a friend&s;hip, is
to &s;urvive the friend; nor are there
wanting in&s;tances in which this has not
been &s;uffered, and the violence of grief
has operated like a voluntary death.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hips of men of the world
are different both in their features and
their complections. There we find with
facility, men of analogous di&s;po&s;itions;
but &s;uch intimacies terminate in com|plaint
and contempt. A feeble mind
acquires &s;till more imbecillity with the
feeble; a di&s;&s;olute heart riots in guilt
with the di&s;&s;olute; and while we de&s;pi&s;e
our companion, we in return have be|come
de&s;picable.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t plea&s;ing effu&s;ions of
a man of genius, are tho&s;e little pieces
which he con&s;ecrates to the cau&s;e of
friend&s;hip; and among his noble&s;t ac|tions,
are tho&s;e fervid and &s;pontaneous
<PB N="129" REF="151">
te&s;timonies of affection, of which literary
hi&s;tory affords many examples. I &s;hall
have no recour&s;e to the abundant in|&s;tances
which the ancients have left; the
moderns may be in&s;tructed by the mo|derns.
To notice a few will be &s;ufficient,
and not to notice them, would be re|fu&s;ing
the young reader no ordinary
gratification. Such is the memorable
friend&s;hip of Beaumont and Fletcher,
that as they have &s;o clo&s;ely united their
labours that we know not the productions
of either; it is with equal difficulty bio|graphers
compo&s;e the memoirs of one,
without running into the life of the other.
They pourtrayed the &s;ame characters,
while they mingled &s;entiment with &s;en|timent,
and their days were not more
clo&s;ely interwoven than their ver&s;es. The
poem of Cowley, on the death of his
friend Harvey, is not, indeed, free from
&s;ome of his remote conceits; yet the fol|lowing
<PB N="130" REF="152">
&s;tanza pre&s;ents a plea&s;ing picture
of the employments of two young
&s;tudents.<Q><L>Say, for you &s;aw us ye immortal lights,</L>
<L>How oft unwearied have we &s;pent the nights&punc;</L>
<L>Till the Ledaean &s;tars, &s;o famed for love,</L>
<L>Wond'red at us from above.</L>
<L>We &s;pent them not in toys, in lu&s;t, or wine;</L>
<L>But &s;earch of deep philo&s;ophy,</L>
<L>Wit, eloquence, and poetry,</L>
<L>Arts which I loved, for they, my friend, were thine.</L></Q></P>
<P>Milton has not only given the exqui&s;ite
Lycidas to the memory of a young
friend, but in his <HI>Epitaphium Damonis,</HI>
to that of Deodatus, has poured forth
&s;ome intere&s;ting &s;entiments. It has been
ver&s;ified by Langhorne. Now, &s;ays the
poet,<Q><L>To whom &s;hall I my hopes and fears impart,</L>
<L>Or tru&s;t the cares and follies of my heart.</L></Q> The elegy of Tickel, maliciou&s;ly called
by Steele, "pro&s;e in rhime," is alike
in&s;pired by affection and fancy; it has a
<PB N="131" REF="153">
melodious languor, and a melancholy
grace. The &s;onnet of Gray, to the me|mory
of We&s;t, is a beautiful effu&s;ion, and
a model for Engli&s;h &s;onnets. Helvetius
was the protector of men of genius,
whom he a&s;&s;i&s;ted not only with his cri|tici&s;m,
but his fortune. At his death,
M. Surin read in the French academy,
an epi&s;tle to the manes of his friend.
Saurin, wre&s;tling with ob&s;curity and po|verty,
was drawn into literary exi&s;tence
by the &s;upporting hand of Helvetius.
Our poet thus addre&s;&s;es him in the warm
tones of gratitude.<Q><L>C'e&s;t toi qui me cherchant au &s;ein de l'infortune</L>

The literary friend&s;hip of a father with
his &s;on, is one of the mo&s;t rare alliances
in the republic of letters. We have had
a remarkable in&s;tance in the two Richard|&s;ons;
and the father, in his fine original
and warm manner, has employed the
mo&s;t glowing language to expre&s;s his
&s;entiments on this affection. He &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline">my time of learning was employed in
bu&s;ine&s;s; but after all I have the
Greek and Latin tongues, becau&s;e a
part of me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, to whom I
can recur at plea&s;ure, ju&s;t as I have a
hand when I would write or paint, feet
to walk, and eyes to &s;ee. My &s;on is my
learning, as I am that to him which he
has not; we make one man, and &s;uch
a compound man may probably pro|duce
what no &s;ingle man can.</Q> And
further, <Q REND="inline">I always think it my peculiar
happine&s;s to be as it were enlarged, ex|panded,

acqui&s;ition of my &s;on, and he thinks
in the &s;ame manner concerning my
union with him.</Q> All this is as cu|rious
as it is uncommon.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that men
of genius have remained &s;atisfied with
only giving a few ver&s;es to the duties of
friend&s;hip. The elevation of their minds
has rai&s;ed them into dome&s;tic heroes,
who&s;e actions are often only recorded in
the unpubli&s;hed regi&s;ter of private life.
Some for their friend have died, pene|trated
with incon&s;olable grief; &s;ome
have &s;acrificed their character to his own;
&s;ome have &s;hared their limited fortune;
and &s;ome have remained attached to
their friend in the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on of ad|ver&s;ity.
In the note underneath I adduce
my proofs of what is &s;o honourable to
literature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jurieu denounced Bayle as an impious writer, and drew his te&s;timonies from the "Avis aux Refugies." This work is written again&s;t Calvini&s;ts, and therefore becomes impious in Holland. Bayle might have ex|culpated him&s;elf with facility, by declaring the work was compo&s;ed by La Roque; but he preferred to be per&s;ecuted, rather than to ruin his friend; he there|fore was &s;ilent, and condemned.&mdash;When the mini&s;ter Fouquet was abandoned by all, it was the men of let|ters he had patroni&s;ed, who never for&s;ook his pri&s;on; and many have dedicated their works to great men in their adver&s;ity, whom they &s;corned to notice, at the time when they were noticed by all.&mdash;The learned Goguet bequeathed his MSS. and library to his friend Fugere, with whom he had united his affections and his &s;tudies. His work on the Origin of the Arts and Sciences, had been much indebted to his aid. In vain was the legacy bequeathed; Goguet died of a &s;low and painful di&s;order; Fugere, who knew him to be pa&s;t recovery, pre&s;erved a mute de&s;pair, retired home, and the victim of &s;en&s;ibility and friend&s;hip died, a few weeks after his friend.&mdash;The Abb&egrave; de Saint Pierre gave an intere&s;ting proof of literary friend&s;hip. When he was at College, he formed a union with Varignon, the geometrician. They were of congenial di&s;po&s;i|tions; when he went to Paris, he invited Varignon to accompany him; but Varignon had nothing, and the Abb&egrave; was far from rich. A certain income was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the tranquil pur&s;uits of geometry. Our Abb&egrave; had an income of 1800 livres; from this he de|ducted 300, which he gave to the geometrician, but accompanied by a delicacy which none but a man of genius could conceive. I do not give it you (he &s;aid) as a &s;alary, but an annuity, that you may be inde|pendent, and quit, when you di&s;like me. Something nearly &s;imilar embelli&s;hes our own &s;canty literary hi&s;|tory. When Aken&s;ide was in great danger of experiencing famine as well as fame, Mr. Dy&s;on al|lowed him three hundred pounds a year. Of this gentleman, perhaps, nothing is known; yet whatever his life may be, it merits the tribute of the biographer; this &s;ingle action will ca&s;t a lu&s;tre round the meane&s;t objects. The <HI>race</HI> of the Dy&s;ons are, no doubt, long extinct; it would be ra&s;h for another Aken&s;ide to look round for another Dy&s;on. To clo&s;e with the&s;e honourable te&s;timonies of literary friend&s;hip, we mu&s;t not omit that of Churchill and Lloyd. It is known that when Lloyd heard of the death of our poet, he acted the port which Fugere did to Goguet. I conclude by remarking that the page is crouded, but my memory is by no means exhau&s;ted.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="156">
I &s;hall be conci&s;e on the &s;ubject of their
enmities; for what could even ingenuity
<PB N="135" REF="157">
urge to di&s;tingui&s;h literary calumny
from any other kind? The reflection
&s;hould humiliate men of genius, that
when they conde&s;cend to a&s;per&s;e with
rage and malignity, another arti&s;t, they
are only doing what the wor&s;t part of &s;o|ciety
can perform, as well as them&s;elves.</P>

But rea&s;on trembles when wit is

But how rarely are &s;atiri&s;ts conducted by
rea&s;on! Our laws offer no protection from
a bitter epigram, and an artful &s;atire.
Irony is not denominated by an attorney
a libel; by an hone&s;t man it may be felt
as &s;omething much wor&s;e. Fortune has
been lo&s;t, reputation de&s;troyed, and every
charity of life been extingui&s;hed by witty
malice. To deba&s;e a man in the circle
of his acquaintance, if unfortunately his
&s;en&s;ibility is exqui&s;ite, has not infre|quently
been committing a le&s;s crime
than murder. The Abb&egrave; Ca&s;&s;agne felt
&s;o acutely the cau&s;tic ver&s;e of Boileau,
that, in the prime of life, he became
melancholy, and died in&s;ane. A modern
painter fell the victim of the critici&s;m

and the wit of a &s;atiri&s;t, who &s;hall be
namele&s;s on this occa&s;ion. Dr. John&s;on

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Characters of Writers not di&s;coverable
in their Writings.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been a cheri&s;hed notion
among men of ta&s;te, that the di&s;po&s;itions
of an arti&s;t appear in his works; and the
&s;ublime Angelo, and the graceful Ra|phael,
are produced as &s;plendid in&s;tances.
It has al&s;o been a very ancient opinion,
that the character of an author is di&s;|coverable
in his writings. The echo from
biographers has been con&s;tant, and often
they pourtray the man, by the mirror of
his works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ruffhead, in his dull book on Pope, &s;ays, (p. 8.) <Q REND="inline">To an accurate ob&s;erver, the temper and morals of a writer breathe throughout his works.</Q> What has been the con&s;equence of this fal&s;e and popular opi|nion? He has written a great deal about Pope and Poetry, and, as John&s;on &s;aid, he knew as little of one as the other.</P></NOTE> The anecdote which Dr.
<PB N="139" REF="161">
John&s;on has given of Thom&s;on, has
&s;erved at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pect it's fallibility.
The &s;ubject, however, demands inve&s;ti|gation,
and perhaps may be finally ter|minated
by the facts I now adduce.</P>
<P>We enquire whether he is a moral
man who compo&s;es moral e&s;&s;ays; incon|tinent,
who writes la&s;civious poems;
malignant, who publi&s;hes bitter &s;atires;
and &s;avage, who&s;e imagination delights
in terror and in blood.</P>
<P>It is one characteri&s;tic of genius to &s;ay
things for their ingenuity, and to di&s;play
the felicity of fancy, than from any utility
which may be drawn from them. Of
many ob&s;cene poets, the greater part
have led cha&s;te lives; and this topic has
engaged the acute examination of Bayle.
La Mothe le V&aacute;ier wrote two works of a
free nature; yet his life was the unble|mi&s;hed
life of a retired &s;age. Of many of
the ancient poets, it appears that the li|centiou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="162">
of their ver&s;e, was by no
means communicated to their manners.
Their page was la&s;civious, and their life
pure, for the fancy may be debauched,
and the heart au&s;tere.</P>
<P>The licentious tales of La Fontaine
are well known, but not a &s;ingle amour
has been recorded of the "bon homme."
Bayle is a remarkable in&s;tance; no writer
is more ample in his detail of impurity,
but he re&s;i&s;ted the pollution of the &s;en&s;es
as much as Newton. He painted his
&s;cenes of lewdne&s;s merely as a faithful
hi&s;torian, and an exact compiler. Smol|let's
character is immaculate, yet what a
de&s;cription has he given of one of his
heroes with Lord Straddle. I cannot
but ob&s;erve on &s;uch &s;cenes, that their
delineation an&s;wers no good purpo&s;e.
Mode&s;ty cannot read, and is morality
intere&s;ted? He a&s;&s;umed the character
of Petronius Arbiter; we applaud and
<PB N="141" REF="163">
we cen&s;ure this mere playfulne&s;s of fancy.
It is certain, however, by the&s;e in&s;tances,
that licentious writers may be very
cha&s;te men.</P>
<P>We now turn to tho&s;e works which, by
their ca&s;t, promi&s;e that the authors were
pious and moral men. Two celebrated
ancients mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over in this
enumeration, Seneca and Sallu&s;t. The
fir&s;t is an admirable &s;toic, elaborate in
his delineation of the moral duties; but
his e&s;&s;ays on the advantages of poverty,
were written on a table of gold, and his
admonitions of &s;upporting pain, on vo|luptuous
&s;ophas, and in fragrant baths.
This moral declaimer ruined my county.
E&s;&s;ex, by the mo&s;t exorbitant u&s;uries,
and inculcated the comforts of poverty
with a fortune of &s;even millions. Sallu&s;t
elegantly declaims again&s;t the licentious
manners of his age, but we happen to
know that he was repeatedly accu&s;ed in
<PB N="142" REF="164">
the &s;enate for public and habitual de|baucheries.
He inveighs again&s;t the
&s;poilers of countries, yet, when he at|tained
to a remote government, he be|came
a Verres. Lucian, in his early
productions, declaims again&s;t the friend|&s;hips
of the great, as another name for
&s;ervitude; when his talents made him
known, he accepted a place under the
Emperor. He has attempted to apolo|gize
for his conduct, by comparing him|&s;elf
to tho&s;e quacks, who, indi&s;po&s;ed
with a &s;evere cough, &s;ell infallible reme|dies
for it's cure. At the moment the
poet Rou&s;&s;eau was giving ver&s;ions of the
p&s;alms, he was occupied on the mo&s;t in|famous
epigrams. A living painter,
who&s;e pictures only repre&s;ent acts of be|nevolence
and charity, is as little generous
as he is cha&s;te.</P>
<P>We have been told that the &s;en&s;ibility
of Sterne was more that of the author
<PB N="143" REF="165">
than the man; perhaps tho&s;e who gave
the information were incompetent jud|ges;
but I do not find this any more
difficult to credit, than a circum&s;tance
which happened to Klop&s;tock. This
votary of Zion's mu&s;e a&s;toni&s;hed and
warmed the &s;age Bodmer, who &s;uppo&s;ing
him a poet of an advanced age, and an
enthu&s;ia&s;t for retirement, invited him to
his re&s;idence; but when the epic poet
arrived, he was found no proper a&s;&s;ociate
for the grave profe&s;&s;or; he had all the
levity and volatility of youth. So very
erroneous is the conception often of the
form and manners of a di&s;tant author.</P>
<P>John&s;on would not believe that Horace
was a happy man, becau&s;e his ver&s;es
were chearful; no more than he could
think Pope was &s;o, becau&s;e he is con|tinually
informing us of it. He ob&s;erved
that Dr. Young, who pined for prefer|ment,
contemns it in his writings. It
<PB N="144" REF="166">
is &s;ingular that the &s;ombrous author of
the night thoughts, was the fir&s;t to
propo&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription for the balls at
Wellwyn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This anecdote is from Mr. Pye's commentary on the poetic of Ari&s;totle. This work has great claims on the attention of the critical reader. It is not as it's title would &s;eem to import, an arid pedantic and me|taphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, but elegant, amu&s;ing, and u&s;eful critici&s;m.</NOTE> Young was as chearful in
conver&s;ation as he was gloomy in his
compo&s;itions, and when a lady expre&s;&s;ed
her &s;urpri&s;e at his &s;ocial conver&s;e, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">there is much difference be|tween
writing and talking.</Q> Are we
to credit the good fortune with which
&s;ome poets &s;o often felicitate them&s;elves,
any more than their de&s;pondence and
menaces? Thom&s;on paints the &s;cenes of
dome&s;tic love with all the &s;plendid de|corations
of fancy, but knew nothing of
it's reality but a ca&s;ual and gro&s;s in|dulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="167">
Incon&s;tant men will write on con&s;tancy,

gaiety and gracefulne&s;s in his compo|&s;itions,
was in his dome&s;tic language,
har&s;h and &s;tiff, for having frequented the
nobility, he ever a&s;&s;umed the Seigneur.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The comedies of M. de St. Foix are light, agree|able, and delicate; his own character was remarkable for moro&s;ene&s;s, rudene&s;s, and in&s;ociability. Moliere, &s;o gay and &s;pirited in his comedy, was grave and pen|&s;ive in &s;ociety.</NOTE>
Writers of great genius have felt them|&s;elves
in awkward &s;ituations, when the
extraordinary &s;entiments they make
their dramatis per&s;onae utter, are malici|ou&s;ly
applied to their own character. An
enemy of Shake&s;peare, might have re|proached
him with his forcible deline|ation
of the villain Iago. Crebillon,
indeed, complains in the preface to one
of his tragedies, of &s;omething &s;imilar.
He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">they charge me with all the
<PB N="147" REF="169">
iniquities of Atreus; and they regard
me, in &s;ome places, as a wretch with
whom it is unfit to a&s;&s;ociate; as if all
which the mind invents, mu&s;t be de|rived
from the heart.</Q> Our poet is,
indeed, a &s;triking in&s;tance of the little
alliance between the literary and per&s;onal
di&s;po&s;itions of an author. In his Atreus,
the father drinks the blood of his &s;on;
in Rhadami&s;tus, the &s;on expires by the
hand of the father; and in his Electra,
the &s;on a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates his mother; yet was
Crebillon the gentle&s;t and mo&s;t amiable
of men, and who exulted on his entrance
into the French academy, that he had
never tinged his pen with the gall of
&s;atire. The impiety of Satan, might
equally be attributed to the poet; and
Dr. Moore might be &s;uppo&s;ed the wor&s;t
of men, by his forcible delineation of
Zeluco. A poet is a painter of the &s;oul;
if he &s;eizes it's deformities, he is a great
arti&s;t, but not therefore a bad man.</P>

I &s;pare the reader a number of in|&s;tances

the mind, and with &s;trokes of &s;entiment,

But this may proceed from a

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of &s;ome private Advantages which induce
Men of Letters to become Authors.</HEAD>
<P>SOME private intere&s;t enters into his
view who a&s;&s;umes the profe&s;&s;ion of an
author. Such a motive fortunately ex|i&s;ts;
for no rea&s;oning man would volun|tarily
place him&s;elf in a &s;ituation, fraught
with burning anxieties, and with &s;ick|ening
di&s;gu&s;ts; with hope mingling with
de&s;pondence; with felicity &s;o variable,
that the utmo&s;t happine&s;s of an author is
as tran&s;ient and rare, as tho&s;e fine Italian
&s;kies we &s;ometimes &s;ee in our un&s;ettled
climate.</P>
<P>Many are the motives which induce
to become authors; their motives, like
their misfortunes, are peculiar to them|&s;elves;
but the utility they produce ap|pertains
to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="173">
Some enter the perilous and brilliant
career of letters, as the only means of
di&s;tingui&s;hing their abilities, and meriting
public e&s;teem. To any other pur&s;uit,
their &s;ituation, or their di&s;po&s;itions, may
be incompatible. The re&s;tle&s;s activity
of genius torments their repo&s;e; and
they feel like a young Columbus, con|fined
to a petty port. The&s;e are men to
whom glory becomes a kind of aliment,
deprived of which, their pa&s;&s;ions, like a
concealed fire, would &s;ecretly con&s;ume
the frail machine of humanity. For
&s;uch, it is as impo&s;&s;ible to remain &s;ilent,
as it is for &s;ome to be eloquent. They
give a voice to their feelings in their
works.</P>
<P>Others become authors, as the only
relief they find from the taedium of life.
Helvetius has maintained the &s;ingular
paradox, that <HI>Ennui</HI> produced many of
our &s;uperior writers. Several authors have
<PB N="152" REF="174">
invented their works, as &s;o many &s;chemes
to e&s;cape from the pre&s;&s;ure of life.
It was an a&s;&s;ertion drawn, perhaps, from
his own feelings. A financier, luxuria|ting
in &s;plendid opulence, courted by
each &s;eductive form of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s,
already acknowledged as an elegant wri|ter
and a liberal Mecenas, could only
have been induced by this motive to
encounter the clo&s;e meditation, the la|borious
arrangement, and the elaborate
elegance of a work which he re&s;olved
&s;hould be po&s;thumous. It is to <HI>Ennui</HI>
we owe that numerous race of opulent
&s;cribblers, who after reiterated ill &s;uc|ce&s;s,
&s;till pour their plenteous volumes
on a wearied and incurious public. Ma|rolles
per&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t in his uninter|rupted
amu&s;ement of printing books,
and his readers having long cea&s;ed, he
was compelled to pre&s;ent them to his
friends, who, however, were not his
<PB N="153" REF="175">
readers. There are many writers who
pa&s;s their days in amazing labours, and
are veterans without being known as vo|lunteers.
Of &s;ome, a private pre&s;s is
the literary horizon; compo&s;ition pre|&s;erves
their mind from what a French
writer plea&s;antly calls "the horrors of
dige&s;tion." It is well if they would
only take their phy&s;ic in private. The&s;e
are the Shake&s;peares who&s;e plays have
been refu&s;ed, and the Addi&s;ons who&s;e
&s;pectators have never been read.</P>
<P>Others follow the avocations of an au|thor
as a means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the
produce of virtuous talents; their mo|derate
and precarious exi&s;tence is more
honourable than a ducal revenue, and
more precious than a contractor's loan.
When we know that &s;uch a writer has
never violated the dignity of human na|ture,
but has rigidly reverenced virtue,
and an elevation of &s;oul has taught him
<PB N="154" REF="176">
to repel the in&s;ulting familiarity of the
great, his works receive a new and ac|cidental
value. We pur&s;ue our medi|tations
with confidence, and we dwell on
tho&s;e fervid &s;trokes which are the natural
expre&s;&s;ions of a great genius, wre&s;tling
with a heavy and oppre&s;&s;ive fortune.</P>
<P>Literature is, indeed, the only refuge
for genius, placed in ob&s;cure &s;ituations.
It is an avenue to glory, open for tho&s;e
ingenious men, who, deprived of ho|nours
or of wealth, may by their medi|tations,
&s;ometimes obtain both; or if
they do not obtain either, may be ren|dered
&s;uperior to them. To many young
writers the idea may be con&s;olatory and
animating, that the greater part of our
fir&s;t authors have ennobled them&s;elves,
and owed nothing to their parents. The
great Grecian orator, was the &s;on of a
&s;inith; the prince of Latin poets, of a
potter; the fine&s;t &s;atiri&s;t and ode writer
<PB N="155" REF="177">
of antiquity, of a franchi&s;ed man; the
brilliant Flechier, of a tallow chandler;
the eloquent Ma&s;&s;illon, of a tanner; and
the philo&s;ophers Rou&s;&s;eau and Diderot,
of a watch-maker and a cutler; in Eng|land,
the mo&s;t nervous of moral e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts,
was the &s;on of one who kept a book &s;tall;
the author of the Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion,
was the &s;on of a butcher; and the
greater author of the American Revolu|tion,
of a tallow chandler.</P>
<P>Genius has the prerogative of rai&s;ing
the inferior ranks of men to the higher
cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. This once obtained,
the age is ju&s;t; and the higher cla&s;&s;es
become inferior.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, ad|vantages
better known, attending the
occupations of literary men. Tho&s;e de|rived
from &s;tudious habits, would be &s;uf|ficient
to attach the elegant mind to
literature, if rea&s;on had much power
<PB N="156" REF="178">
over the pa&s;&s;ions; the attraction is irre|&s;i&s;tible,
when rea&s;on it&s;elf becomes a
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of literature have long
been a favourite amplification of elo|quence;
and I quote not the admirable
reflections or of Cicero, or of Pliny, fa|miliar
to every man of ta&s;te. He who
con&s;ecrates him&s;elf to letters, e&s;capes
from the re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ires of the multitude.
The mephitic air of vulgar pa&s;&s;ions can|not
reach him; as, we are informed of
the pernicious vapour of the lake of the
dogs in Italy, that if a per&s;on does not
bend downwards, it cannot affect him.
Is he opulent? he has &s;ufficient firmne&s;s
to remain enamoured of literary labour.
Is he poor? he has &s;ufficient intrepidity
to become illu&s;trious. The fir&s;t effect of
a love of letters communicates virtue and
independence; for he has &s;ilenced many
<PB N="157" REF="179">
private pa&s;&s;ions, and inhabits the inte|rior,
not the &s;uperficies of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>It is a curious ob&s;ervation of one
Martinelli, an Italian, who, to prove
that Study &s;oftens the manners, &s;ays, that
rarely men of letters are a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in Italy,
duelli&s;ts in France, or &s;uicides in Eng|land.
It is true we want not the opinion
of Martinelli, becau&s;e it has been ele|gantly
&s;aid by Horace, repeated by the
thinking Hume, and is to be found
in every book of rhetoric, in the fir&s;t
chapter.</P>
<P>Literature is the only con&s;olation in
tho&s;e terrible afflictions, when we are re|duced
by the privation of a &s;en&s;e, to take
our la&s;t refuge under the dome&s;tic roof.
Blindne&s;s it&s;elf is no impediment to ge|nius;
fatal to all, it is an advantage to
an active imagination. It's powers collect
more forcibly and burn more inten&s;ely.
It is po&s;&s;ible to form a catalogue of men
<PB N="158" REF="180">
of learning who have projected and
fini&s;hed con&s;iderable works in this &s;itu|ation.
Often, too, has the gate of the
pri&s;on been the porch of fame, and a
&s;light indi&s;po&s;ition conferred immorta|lity.
A man of letters can never be &s;aid
to be exiled or impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>It is even to be &s;uppo&s;ed, again&s;t the
popular opinion, that &s;tudy is friendly to
the con&s;titution. A life of letters is calm
and uniform, and cheri&s;hes the mild af|fections.
An author, if he feels not too
&s;en&s;ibly an occa&s;ional di&s;appointment,
and can forgive the malice of an enemy,
finds his &s;tudies produce a happy influ|ence
over his health. Hourly acqui&s;i|tions
bring new delights, and thought
from thought is pur&s;ued with tranquil|lity;
and delight and tranquillity are
medicines to the &s;oul, and promoters of
health. Every production of ta&s;te re|&s;pires
a &s;oftening balm, which &s;weetens
<PB N="159" REF="181">
that continuity of attention only expe|rienced
by men of &s;tudy. If an anatomi&s;t
could de&s;cribe accurately the &s;en&s;ations
of a man of ta&s;te, and explain this pla|cable
and harmonious play of the nerves,
no &s;tate of exi&s;tence might, perhaps, be
found more friendly to the human frame.
Every one in the habits of &s;tudy has per|ceived
the influence of the mind over the
body; and Addi&s;on has noticed the
plea&s;ures of the imagination as conducive
to health.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On this &s;ubject the following anecdote is curious. Alphon&s;o of Arragon, was a prince pa&s;&s;ionately en|amoured of literature. When he lay much indi&s;po&s;ed, and could find no relief from his phy&s;icians, his cour|tiers brought whatever pre&s;ents they imagined might amu&s;e him; Panormita judged proper to pre&s;ent him with books, among which was a Quintus Curtius, which appears to have had a wonderful effect over the &s;tudious Alphon&s;o. He heard with &s;uch delight, the Hi&s;tory of Alexander the Great, that after the fir&s;t day he felt him&s;elf relieved, and before the conclu&s;ion of the work, a&s;toni&s;hed his phy&s;icians, by a perfect recovery. He ever afterwards contemned the doctors and their Hippocrates and Avicenna, and &s;aid he re|quired no other medicine while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Quintus Curtius. <HI>Valeant Hippocrates, Avicena, et Medici caeteri, Vivat Curtius &s;o&s;pitator meus.</HI></P></NOTE> The greater number of emi|nent
writers have attained to an advanced
age. In an e&s;&s;ay by Dr. Ru&s;hworth, a
number of ages of great &s;tudents are col|lected,
and his opinion is confirmed by
&s;ufficient te&s;timonies. Bayle &s;till pro|ceeds
<PB N="160" REF="182">
further, by &s;aying, that &s;tudy is
not hurtful to the con&s;titution even in
early youth. Shen&s;tone has, however,
echoed in one of his elegies, the vulgar
opinion,<Q>But &s;oon the paths of health and and fame divide.</Q> If by the path of fame, our amiable wri|ter
meant &s;tudy, his ill health was never
occa&s;ioned by profound learning.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, will not deem as one
of the inferior advantages of an author,
that of his admi&s;&s;ion among the higher
circles. If in the pre&s;ent age, no writer
<PB N="161" REF="183">
can rea&s;onably hope that his &s;tudies will
open the golden gate of preferment, or
of fortune, he may at lea&s;t, when he at|tains
to eminence, be certain of receiving
the tribute which opulent vanity pays to
his talents. But an author is little in|debted
to &s;uch notice; the attentions of
a brilliant circle are ill-timed; it is, per|haps,
twenty years too late. It is al&s;o
to be ob&s;erved, that few men of ta&s;te can
accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the refinements
of opulent grandeur, without creating
artificial wants, which they can never
gratify; and their future life may feel
the irritation of plea&s;ures not to be pur|cha&s;ed,
and elegance not to be found.
To &s;uch may often be applied the ex|clamation
of Milton's Adam, when obli|ged
to exile him&s;elf from paradi&s;e&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;How &s;hall I breathe in other air</L>
<L>Le&s;s pure, accu&s;tomed to immortal fruits?</L></Q>
The &s;ociety of the great is little flatter|ing;
<PB N="162" REF="184">
for it requires a painful vigilance to
pre&s;erve dignity with &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates.
D'Alembert has written an admired e&s;&s;ay
on the connection between literary men,
and the&s;e men. A man of letters who
had the misfortune of living with a lord,
finely &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">he would familiari&s;e
him&s;elf with me; but I repel him re|&s;pectfully.</Q>
An anecdote related of
Piron is not le&s;s intere&s;ting. This man
of genius had formed the mo&s;t elevated
notion of the dignity of a man of letters;
nor would &s;uffer the literary character to
be lowered in his pre&s;ence. Entering the
apartment of a nobleman, who was con|ducting
another peer to the &s;tairs, the
noble &s;topped to make way for Piron,
pa&s;s on, my lord, &s;aid the noble ma&s;ter,
pa&s;s, he is only a poet.&mdash;Piron replied,
<Q REND="inline">&s;ince our qualities are declared, I &s;hall
take my rank,</Q> and he placed him&s;elf
before the lord.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="185">
If the voice of an individual can weigh
with an author, it is when it &s;peaks in a
foreign accent. The enquiry of an in|telligent
foreigner &s;ounds like the di&s;tant
plaudit of po&s;terity. Fontenelle was never
more gratified than when a Swede, ar|riving
at the gates of Paris, enquired of
the officers of the cu&s;toms where Fon|tenelle
re&s;ided, and expre&s;&s;ed his indig|nation
that none of them &s;hould have
ever heard of his name.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome hours in the life of a
man of genius, which, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed,
communicate an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;a|tion
to his feelings. It is when he
perceives the world &s;pontaneou&s;ly pay
their tribute of re&s;pect to his abilities.
It is &s;aid of Corneille, that he had his
particular &s;eat in the theatre, and that
when he entered, the audience ro&s;e to
&s;alute him. We know what exce&s;s of
honours was paid (the expre&s;&s;ion will be
<PB N="164" REF="186">
pardoned by men of ta&s;te) to the match|le&s;s
Voltaire. Spino&s;a, while he gained
a humble livelihood by grinding gla&s;&s;es
at an ob&s;cure village in Holland, was
vi&s;ited by the fir&s;t general in Europe,
who, for this conference, &s;u&s;pended the
march of his army, and traver&s;ed a di&s;|tant
province. Rou&s;&s;eau attracted a croud
as he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets; and the people
followed him with tears of affection, as
the apo&s;tles of genius and humanity.
Lavater, receives daily the tribute of po&s;|terity
in the per&s;onal admiration of every
traveller of &s;en&s;ibility and ta&s;te. Such
are the voluntary honours of the human
heart; honours which no monarch can
receive, unle&s;s he is that &s;ingular mo|narch&mdash;
a man of letters on the throne.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve that this chapter on the ad|vantages
of men of genius, is &s;hort, and
that it was with much trouble I could

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the Utility of Authors to Individuals.</HEAD>
<P>WE have rea&s;on to believe, that
wherever authors are virtuous and free,
their nation partakes mo&s;t of virtue and
of freedom; as on the contrary, where
they are di&s;&s;olute and en&s;laved, their
nation have as little morals as liberty.
We want a di&s;&s;ertation on the influence
of manners on ta&s;te, and of ta&s;te on
manners. Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, in one
of his di&s;cour&s;es, ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">in the
ornaments of the arts we find the cha|racteri&s;tical
mark of a national ta&s;te,
as by throwing up a feather, we know
which way the wind blows, better than
by a more heavy matter.</Q></P>
<P>The morals of a nation are oftener di|rected
by authors, than by tho&s;e modern
apo&s;tles who po&s;&s;e&s;s va&s;t incomes, and
<PB N="166" REF="188">
&s;tolen &s;ermons. Authors are the preach|ers
of morality, and the arbiters of man|ners.
They perform the office of the
<HI>Cen&s;or Morum</HI>; and if they do not al|ways
live like the Catos of their age,
their works may effect the &s;ame benefi|cial
influence; for, like the language of
Cato, they are &s;o many reprimands for
folly, and remon&s;trances for vice.</P>
<P>An author &s;ometimes appears, who
gives a new direction to the national cha|racter.
In mechanics, no impul&s;ion,
from a &s;ingle hand, can communicate to
a body the force of eternal movement.
In morals it is different; for there an in|dividual
power can for ever endow with
action the TRUTH it impels. The&s;e are
the few authors who form revolutions,
not, perhaps, in the &s;ublime &s;ciences,
which are re&s;erved for the contemplation
of a few, but in that happier knowledge
which is of daily u&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed to
<PB N="167" REF="189">
tho&s;e who mo&s;t want in&s;truction. The&s;e
authors are not a Newton and a Locke;
but an Addi&s;on and a Fontenelle. The&s;e
two eminent writers &s;hall illu&s;trate this
reflection. The Spectators introduced
literature and morals in the nation; the
young, the gay, and the fair, who flew
from the terrific form of a folio, were at|tracted
by the light graces of a fugitive
page. Since that happy moment the dif|fu&s;ion
of ta&s;te, and the curio&s;ity of know|ledge,
have produced readers who are
now enabled to di&s;cern the &s;hades of ele|gance;
to appreciate compo&s;itions of
genius; and to adju&s;t the merits of in|genious
competitors by the &s;cale of phi|lo&s;ophical
ta&s;te. We have become a
reading, and of cour&s;e a critical nation.
A refined writer is now certain of finding
readers who can comprehend him. Of
all our great men, whatever department
they have illu&s;trated, who has left to the
<PB N="168" REF="190">
nation a more valuable inheritance than
Addi&s;on? Thou&s;ands hear the name of
Marlborough, but the battle of Blenheim
leaves no impre&s;&s;ion. The name of Ad|di&s;on
excites affection; and his Spectators
remind the mode&s;t reader where he fir&s;t
gained in&s;truction, and the great writer
where he fir&s;t felt the influence of ta&s;te,
and where he &s;till learns the art of com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Fontenelle operated the &s;ame kind of
revolution in France. Before his bril|liant
wit and exact &s;cience were united,
learning was the &s;olitary enjoyment of
the learned. A&s;tronomy and erudition
were re&s;erved for the a&s;tronomer and the
erudit. Each &s;poke his own language;
Fontenelle was their interpreter. He
explained va&s;t totalities by gradual de|ductions,
and &s;ublime conceptions, by
familiar ideas. The lady at her toilette
de&s;cribed the motions of a heavenly body,
<PB N="169" REF="191">
while &s;he was regulating her own; and
the beau monde had a finer penetration
into the nature of oracles, than the
pedant Van Dale, who had written &s;o co|piou&s;ly,
and whom no one could read.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the valued authors who de|light
and &s;oothe their fellow-citizens;
the benefactors of every man. A mind
happily di&s;po&s;ed imbibes their felicity of
character. We read, among the Per&s;ian
fables of Sadi, of a &s;wimmer, who, hav|ing
found a piece of common earth, was
a&s;toni&s;hed at it's fragrance, and enquired
if it were mu&s;k or amber? <Q REND="inline">No,</Q> re|plied
the perfumed mould, <Q REND="inline">I am no|thing

poetical incident to the effect his mi&s;tre&s;s

it to an e&s;&s;ay of Addi&s;on, or a dialogue

&s;ome particles from it; a virtuous
writer communicates virtue; a refined
writer, a &s;ubtile delicacy; a &s;ublime
writer, an elevation of &s;entiment. All
the&s;e characters of the mind, in a few
years, are diffu&s;ed throughout the nation.
Among us, what acute rea&s;oners has the
refined penetration of Hume formed;
what amenity of manners has not Addi&s;on
introduced; to how many virtuous youths
have not the moral e&s;&s;ays of John&s;on im|parted
fortitude, and illumined with re|flection?</P>

It is pre&s;umed, that while they thus
powerfully operate on the <HI>minds</HI> of their

of their &s;tudies, are influenced in a &s;imi|lar
manner. One of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing

to this purpo&s;e; and though we have al|ready
proved it, not exactly conformable
to facts, it is not entirely a brilliant re|verie.
Our noble author, comparing the
writer with the &s;culptor and the painter,
&s;ays, that <Q REND="inline">there is this e&s;&s;ential differ|ence
between the arti&s;ts of each kind;
that they who de&s;ign merely after
<HI>bodies,</HI> and form the graces of this &s;ort,
can never, with all their accuracy, or
correctne&s;s of de&s;ign, be able to reform
them&s;elves, or grow a jot more &s;hapely
in their per&s;ons. But for tho&s;e arti&s;ts,
who copy from another life, who &s;tudy
the graces and perfections of <HI>minds,</HI>
and are real ma&s;ters of tho&s;e rules which
<PB N="172" REF="194">
con&s;titute this latter &s;cience, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible
they &s;hould fail of being them|&s;elves
<HI>improved</HI> and <HI>amended</HI> in their
better part.</Q> That delightful enthu|&s;ia&s;t
Richard&s;on the father, in one of his
fine dreams, in&s;i&s;ts (as others indeed
have done) that great virtue is nece&s;&s;ary
even for painters; and that genius has
been le&s;s or greater, as virtue and vice
prevailed in the mind of the arti&s;t. When
we read an amiable compo&s;ition, and
ob&s;erve the character of the author to be
the rever&s;e, there appears an indecent
oppo&s;ition, which revolts our &s;en&s;ibility,
and makes us contemn the writer as a
mi&s;erable impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>This &s;cience of the mind, noticed by
Shafte&s;bury, is not metaphy&s;ics, but
what has been happily called "the
proper &s;tudy of mankind;" Man acting
in &s;ociety. The philo&s;ophic genius ex|cels
in the &s;tudy of the world; he de|rives
<PB N="173" REF="195">
this advantage from the ob&s;curity
of his &s;ituation, the ver&s;atility of his
mind, and the habit of meditation.
Tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>chief occupation</HI> is not <HI>re|flection,</HI>
limit the knowledge of human
nature to the particular &s;ociety they are
accu&s;tomed. A courtier, a lawyer, and
a merchant, contemplate the human
heart, in different lights; but nature is
ill under&s;tood by tho&s;e who&s;e capacities
are habituated to detect one principle
among many. She has no character, but
many characters; &s;he is not to be &s;y&s;|tematized,
but to be pur&s;ued. The
man of genius acts upon more general
principles; and makes the human heart
his amu&s;ement and his occupation. The
theatre, conducted by &s;uch writers, would
become a national &s;chool; but we mu&s;t
then have fewer pantomimes, and &s;uch
operas and comedies as we have now,
&s;till fewer than pantomimes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of the political Influence of Authors.</HEAD>
<P>OPINION, &s;ays Sophocles, is &s;tronger
than Truth; Opinion is the &s;overeign of
man; and authors, who are the propa|gators
of her decrees, are &s;ome of the
mo&s;t important per&s;ons in &s;ociety, and
may be called the mini&s;ters of &s;tate to
Opinion.</P>
<P>An author has the &s;ingular prerogative
of uniting in him&s;elf the powers that are
portioned among the higher orders of
&s;ociety. This reflection may appear fan|ciful
to tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of fancy;
and extravagant to tho&s;e who con&s;ider
paper and pens as the compo&s;ition of the
manufacturer, and who &s;ee nothing in
them but rags and feathers.</P>
<P>An eloquent author, who writes in the
immutable language of truth, will one
<PB N="176" REF="198">
day be &s;uperior to every power in the &s;tate.
His influence is active, though hidden;
every truth is an acorn which is laid in
the earth, and which often the longer
it takes to ri&s;e, the more vigorous and
magnificent will be it's maturity. What
has been long meditated in the &s;ilence of
the &s;tudy, will one day refound in the
aweful voice of public opinion. The
chief magi&s;trate can command; the &s;e|nator
can per&s;uade; the judge can de|cide;
the &s;oldier can conquer. A great
author obtains the&s;e various purpo&s;es at
once by his &s;olitary labours. His truths
command; his eloquence per&s;uades; his
rea&s;on decides; and his works in&s;pire a
rival nation with a more enduring re|&s;pect,
than even a victorious army.</P>
<P>An i&s;land, once incon&s;iderable in Eu|rope,
now ranks among the fir&s;t powers,
arbitrates among other nations, and the
very title of it's inhabitants en&s;ures re|&s;pect.
<PB N="177" REF="199">
Is this owing, alone, to her com|mercial
pro&s;perity and military force?
One nation has the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing mart
of trade, and another is one of the mo&s;t
martial people; yet neither in&s;pire man|kind
with veneration or affection. To
them&s;elves is confined their rude lan|guage;
&s;tudied, perhaps, by merchants,
and corrupted as it is &s;tudied. It is
more by an interchange of opinions, than
of &s;pices and &s;pecie, that a nation is
e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Not thus with England; for &s;he derives
her &s;plendour from her writers, as well
as her &s;oldiers, and her navigators. An
empire merely founded on force, is &s;ur|rounded
by enemies, and often it's &s;in|cere&s;t
enemies are to be found in it's own
unparental bo&s;om. An empire di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by it's literature, conceals it's
martial iron under the &s;weete&s;t flowers;
extends her conque&s;ts, and diffu&s;es her
<PB N="178" REF="200">
plea&s;ures, and among ho&s;tile foreigners,
acquires new friends.</P>
<P>This truth we our&s;elves have experi|enced.
France preceded us in the &s;tu|dies
of humanity, and her polite litera|ture
more forcibly operated on the world,
than even her armies and her fleet; her
civility and refinement vanqui&s;hed, when
the&s;e were defeated. At that period in
&s;ociety, when the intellectual ta&s;tes of
men become &s;o many wants, the&s;e gave
an univer&s;al diffu&s;ion to her language.
The nation that &s;upplies a harve&s;t for
this appetency of the mind, extends it's
dominions in the hearts of the &s;ubjects of
other powers. Thus Pope, with equal
&s;agacity and ta&s;te, writes
<Q><L>We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms,</L>
<L>Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let us now contemplate the rever&s;e of
the medal; and the rever&s;e is more beau|tiful
than the face. In the middle of the
<PB N="179" REF="201">
la&s;t century, our manners were as un|known
as our language; and neither
were yet formed and poli&s;hed. We were
nearly regarded as valorous barbarians,
partaking of the glooms of our clime;
and whom nature had benevolently &s;epa|rated,
from neighbours more poli&s;hed,
and airs more &s;erene. We now hold to
Europe models of &s;olid &s;en&s;e and pro|found
rea&s;oning. Our late admired
writers have made a neglected language
the &s;tudy of reflecting foreigners; they
calmed the national hatred of France,
and compelled even our rivals ince&s;&s;antly
to celebrate our merits, when, unlike
them&s;elves, we conde&s;cended not to ex|ult,
but to perform our labours with a
mode&s;t &s;ilence. Before our pre&s;ent un|happy
di&s;&s;entions, it was our nation they
&s;ighed to emulate; and the fir&s;t writers
of France pa&s;&s;ed into England to learn
to think and write; or thought and
<PB N="180" REF="202">
wrote like Engli&s;hmen in France, undi&s;|mayed
by the terrors of a corrupted go|vernment.
From our hands they received
the germs of reflection, and the flower of
liberty. This &s;ingular revolution in the
human mind was produced not by our
merchants or our admirals, but by our
Lockes, our Popes, and our Addi&s;ons.
They have &s;ubjugated the minds of mil|lions
by the energy of an intellectual &s;o|vereignty.
The works of Engli&s;h authors
are now printed at foreign pre&s;&s;es, and
this at lea&s;t as much as the commerce
and the force of England, proves the
a&s;cendancy of her genius.</P>
<P>The utility of men of letters to na|tional
purpo&s;es is not attended to by
every &s;tate&s;man; for few &s;tate&s;men (like
other men in office) are either worthy of,
or competent to their employments. The
author is con&s;idered by the great as a
&s;ubordinate character in &s;ociety; as if
<PB N="181" REF="203">
the art of in&s;tructing men, the art of a
Socrates, was much inferior to that of
governing them, the art, often of a Nero,
or a Sardanapalus, and, according to
Machiavel, of a Ce&s;ar Borgia.</P>
<P>Political theori&s;ts, however, appear to
con&s;ider the wor&s;t actions of men, as of
far le&s;s con&s;equence than the propagation
of their opinions. A dangerous man may
infect his neighbours, but the dangerous
writer &s;preads a contagion throughout a
nation. Books, and &s;ometimes their au|thors,
have been burnt; but even this
mode of critici&s;m was found ineffectual.
The flame which de&s;troyed an indivi|dual,
ever enlightened a people; and the
burning of books, has not yet been con|&s;idered
as their refutation.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the public
duties of government, were more clo&s;ely
allied with men of letters, the union
would be happy for the people, and u&s;e|ful
<PB N="182" REF="204">
to both. It is unfortunate that tho&s;e
who govern are not always the mo&s;t en|lightened.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The attic Harris of Sali&s;bury, in his "Philo&s;ophi|cal Arrangements," has touched on this topic, and adduced &s;everal &s;plendid facts to enforce his judicious reflections. He has &s;hewn, <Q REND="inline">that &s;ome of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious actors upon the great theatre of the world, have been engaged in philo&s;ophical &s;peculations.</Q> But what is more to our purpo&s;e, we may ob&s;erve that &s;ome of the greate&s;t &s;tate&s;men have attached them&s;elves to a philo&s;opher. Pericles had his Anaxagoras; Sci|pio his Polybius; Ce&s;ar and Pompey, their Ari&s;to and Cratippus; Zenobia her Longinus; and Plutarch &s;aid of Alexander, <Q REND="inline">that he marched again&s;t the Per&s;ians with better &s;upplies from his preceptor Ari&s;totle, than from his father Philip.</Q></P>
<P>It is al&s;o very certain, that the philo&s;ophical is not incompatible with the political character. Sir Walter Raleigh; the De Wits; Thuanus; Grotius; Sir William Temple, Bolingbroke, &amp;c. are &s;ufficient to name. Literary men may become mini&s;ters of &s;tate, but it is more difficult for mini&s;ters of &s;tate to become literary men.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Authors &s;tand between the governors
and the governed; and they who practice
the art of arranging their thoughts, and
of agitating the pa&s;&s;ions, who at once
<PB N="183" REF="205">
penetrate by their rea&s;on, and inflame by
their eloquence, are, among the nations
of modern Europe, what the celebrated
orators of ancient Rome and Athens
were among the a&s;&s;embled citizens. They
awaken, they terrify, they excite, they
conduct the people.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are con&s;trained to watch till
vigilance is exhau&s;ted, and &s;olicitude
&s;leeps amid&s;t the fluctuations of the pub|lic
mind, and this public mind is the
creation of the philo&s;ophical writer. Is
it to be doubted, that &s;ince the immor|tal
labour of Monte&s;quieu, the old &s;y&s;|tems
of government have been often
changed? It is certain the minds of the
people have. Cromwell, the penetrating
Cromwell, was ju&s;tly alarmed when he
&s;aw the Oceana of Harrington, and
&s;eems to have dreaded the terrible effects
of a little volume, much more than the
plots of the royali&s;ts. The &s;ingle thought
<PB N="184" REF="206">
of a man of genius has &s;ometimes chan|ged
the di&s;po&s;itions of a people, and even
of an age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The great Frederick in his Examen of the Prince of Machiavel, ob&s;erving that the minds of men are very different from the ferocious age of that Italian politician, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">for which we are obliged to the WRITINGS of tho&s;e LEARNED MEN, who OF LATE have contributed &s;o much to poli&s;h and civilize EUROPE.</Q></P></NOTE> With every creative genius
that ari&s;es, a new day ri&s;es with him;
it was Monte&s;quieu that introduced in
his nation a ta&s;te for the &s;olid and pro|found,
as well as the gayer and lighter
&s;tudies.</P>
<P>Wherever the liberty of the pre&s;s is
e&s;tabli&s;hed, authors form as powerful a
cla&s;s in &s;ociety, as the highe&s;t. For the
great, nothing remains but to annihilate
the pre&s;s, or to re&s;pect the authors. In
Rome, a Per&s;ius may have been com|pelled
to di&s;gui&s;e the name of a Nero,
but in England, the name of a tyrant
<PB N="185" REF="207">
will be hitched in rhime. Authors are
mo&s;t to be dreaded in that country where
the liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s,
become a mere matter of &s;entiment, and
not of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and this &s;entiment is
left to the people. We who enjoy the
freedom of the pre&s;s in it's extreme de|gree,
have no rea&s;on to complain of any
privileges of the great.</P>
<P>The people con&s;ider authors as their
property; and not unju&s;tly, &s;ince the
great &s;uffer them to depend on the
people. The public are never &s;low to
unite with authors, who, for the &s;ake of
pre&s;erving equality, mu&s;t continually
humble the great. The public, as pa|trons,
are the mo&s;t munificent; as abet|tors,
the mo&s;t formidable. Their favour
is equitably obtained; they expect an
author to be the bold interpreter of their
&s;ecret &s;entiments, and the protector of
their liberties, as well as the arti&s;t of
<PB N="186" REF="208">
their plea&s;ures. If this author is per&s;e|cuted,
he is never for&s;aken; his cau&s;e
becomes the cau&s;e of the people; but if
he &s;hould prove a wretched adventurer;
who artfully &s;ei&s;ed on an occa&s;ion to &s;erve
his private views, the author is ju&s;tly
neglected, and the cau&s;e alone pur&s;ued.
We live in an age, in which an hone&s;t
man begins to know his value; and ob|&s;curity
and poverty, if adorned with in|tegrity
and philo&s;ophy, are not injurious
to the opinions of a great mind. We
con&s;ider that per&s;onal merit, is &s;uperior
to per&s;onal honour; becau&s;e it now in|cludes
per&s;onal honour. The contrary
will not hold, nor has this always been &s;o.</P>
<P>The public are not di&s;plea&s;ed when the
great become the patrons of their emi|nent
authors; it is a kind of homage paid
to the &s;entiments of the people. But the
author may be a con&s;iderable lo&s;er, if he
values fame, more than he does a pen&s;ion.</P>

It is curious to ob&s;erve the &s;olitary
man of letters in the concealment of his

unknown to his contemporaries, col|lecting
the materials of in&s;truction from
every age and every country; combining
with the pre&s;ent the example of the pa&s;t,
and the prediction of the future; pouring
forth the valuable &s;ecrets of his medita|tions
to po&s;terity; &s;triking with the con|cu&s;&s;ion

and forming the manners, the opinions,

ob&s;erve &s;uch a man, by &s;ome contemned,

rai&s;ed to a fancied mon&s;ter; a Briareus

a figure as that of the va&s;t mountain,
to which the caprice of a tyrant attempted
to give a Colo&s;&s;al form, by commanding
the people to hew it to his immoderate
fancy.</P>
<P>But the philo&s;opher is not, as of late,
too often repre&s;ented this Colo&s;&s;al ini|quity.
Legal authority is mo&s;t &s;ecure
when the people are mo&s;t enlightened;
a &s;imple truth, which I leave to profound
politicians to explain. I &s;hall only cite
the &s;entiment of an old poet.<Q><L>&mdash;De la maje&s;t&egrave; des Loix,</L>

<BIBL>MALHERBE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is a dreadful moment when the
people and the great alike refu&s;e the in|&s;tructions
of the philo&s;opher; whenever
he appears terrible, &s;ome great corruption
pervades the &s;tate, for he is only armed
<PB N="189" REF="211">
with truth. The occupations of the
philo&s;ophical &s;tudent, as connected with
political &s;peculations, are therefore du|ties
of an exalted nature; &s;ome mu&s;t give
their hands, &s;ome their blood, and &s;ome
their hours, to the various duties their
country exacts; but there is a &s;mall
portion of men, who appear marked out
by nature, for the purpo&s;e of cultivating
their thoughts in peace, and to give ac|tivity
to their &s;entiments by di&s;clo&s;ing
them to the people. The phy&s;iognomy
of their minds, wears all that &s;hining
lu&s;tre, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the prophet
after his immediate conference with the
Divinity; for in their compo&s;itions, good
&s;en&s;e is embelli&s;hed by eloquence, and
before they per&s;uade, they convince.
None, but tho&s;e who devote a life to me|ditation,
can effect the&s;e great purpo&s;es;
for they who govern a people, cannot at
the &s;ame time enlighten them.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="212">
Legi&s;lators of exten&s;ive views, have
ever protected and honoured men of
letters. We have &s;een, in this age, two
great powers in Europe te&s;tify their pub|lic
utility, and who have been as &s;oli|citous
to a&s;&s;emble philo&s;ophers, as to
form their armies. Pru&s;&s;ia and Ru&s;&s;ia,
under the government of two great &s;ove|reigns,
have &s;hewn how far by their aid
an ob&s;cure principality, and hordes of
barbarians, may be elevated in the &s;cale
of humanity. The great Frederick in|vited
to his court the per&s;ecuted and un|happy
literati; and to this holy &s;hrine of
philo&s;ophy re&s;orted many a literary pil|grim.
The imperial Catharine has not
only largely pen&s;ioned &s;everal illu&s;trious
writers, but honours and animates, by her
gifts, the attempt of every philo&s;opher
who produces a public utility. If the&s;e
&s;overeigns have di&s;played more art than
humanity, in forging chains for the free|dom
<PB N="191" REF="213">
of men; it &s;hews that an Antoninus and
an Alfred, are more rare than a Frederick
and a Catharine, as the love of philo&s;o|phy
is le&s;s difficult than practical philo|&s;ophy;
the only philo&s;ophy that merits
the name.</P>
<P>It is the philo&s;ophical writer who alone
reflects on what is not done, and on what
may be done. He goads the &s;luggi&s;h
veins of government, when a cold indo|lence
&s;preads a torpor on it's unhealth|ful
inactivity. He teaches philanthropy
to direct it's bounties in proper channels,
and this is no incon&s;iderable good; for
the humanity which di&s;tingui&s;hes our
age, is often only retarded by an igno|rance
of it's nece&s;&s;ities; to perceive and
pathetically to de&s;cribe the&s;e nece&s;&s;ities,
is re&s;erved for the &s;en&s;itive philo&s;opher.
It is the characteri&s;tic of a man of genius,
in &s;uch appeals to our bo&s;oms, that his
glowing mind pours forth tho&s;e &s;ervid ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="192" REF="214">
that agitation of ideas, tho&s;e
pictures of truth, which communicate his
own &s;en&s;ations, and animate with his
exqui&s;ite &s;oul, the &s;ouls of others. The
people are a va&s;t body, and men of
genius are the eyes and hands.</P>
<P>The thou&s;and public utilities, I &s;peak
not of the elegancies, derived from the
multifarious divi&s;ions of &s;cience and of
art, can alone be perfected by THE PHI|LOSOPHICAL
GENIUS. Truth is a certain
point in knowledge; ages &s;ucceed ages;
and that point is pa&s;&s;ed, or not attained;
a philo&s;ophical genius ari&s;es, &s;ei&s;es and
fixes it in the va&s;t expan&s;e of nature, &s;e|cured
by it's own weight from the mobi|lity
of time. A Newton and a Locke ac|compli&s;h
that in which an Ari&s;totle and
a De&s;cartes failed. But the&s;e truths,
which form &s;o many epochs in the hu|man
under&s;tanding, are covered in the
&s;ublime ob&s;curity of nature; how is the
<PB N="193" REF="215">
veil to be lifted from I&s;is? A painful
meditation alone elaborates them into
exi&s;tence. In the arts, important di&s;|coveries
are obtained by accident; but
the precious idea, which depends on a
long train of rea&s;oning, can never be
formed by chance. Philo&s;ophers mu&s;t
meditate; and too often their medita|tions
are pur&s;ued at the co&s;t of their
felicity.</P>
<P>Yet let us not confound true PHILOSO|PHERS
with dreaming THEORISTS. They
are not more engaged in cultivating the
mind, than the earth; the annals of agri|culture
are as valuable as the annals of
hi&s;tory; and while they in&s;truct &s;ome to
think, they teach others to labour.
PHILOSOPHY extends it's thoughts on

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. On an Academy of polite Literature, Pen|&s;ions,
and Prizes.</HEAD>
<P>TO deliver any novel ob&s;ervations on
an academy for the belles lettres is diffi|cult;
but it is more difficult to pa&s;s
&s;uch an object in &s;ilent regret.</P>
<P>The munificent hand of maje&s;ty has
rai&s;ed an in&s;titution to the mimetic art
of painting; and this is a legitimate
claim, which a prince, the commence|ment
of who&s;e reign was adorned by an
honourable love of the arts, has to the
e&s;timation of po&s;terity. But why polite
literature, which forms the delight and
the &s;olace of a greater portion of the na|tion
than this art, &s;hould have received
no &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed approbation from
the Brun&s;wicks, is not to the philo&s;opher,
<PB N="196" REF="218">
perhaps, &s;o much an object of &s;urpri&s;e
as of &s;orrow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t not be forgotten that &s;everal authors have received pen&s;ions; Dr. Henry, Dr. John&s;on, and at pre&s;ent Mr. Cowper the poet, have been honoured by his Maje&s;ty's attentions. But &s;uch &s;olitary rewards are like fountains in the burning de&s;erts of Arabia. One of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t illu&s;trious actions is his conver|&s;ation with Dr. John&s;on, in which an amiable and re|flecting mind adds to the dignity of the Monarch. George II. remon&s;trated with Lord Hervey for writing ver&s;es, which be ob&s;erved might be proper in Mr. Pope, or tho&s;e who lived by the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> but very un|becoming a <HI>Lord.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I begin the&s;e ob&s;ervations with a lite|ral
tran&s;cription of the opening of Sir
Jo&s;hua Reynolds's fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. The
Pre&s;ident &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">it is indeed difficult to
give any other rea&s;on why an empire,
like that of BRITAIN, &s;hould &s;o long
have wanted an ornament &s;o &s;uitable
to it's greatne&s;s, than that &s;low pro|gre&s;&s;ion
of things, which naturally
makes elegance and refinement the la&s;t
effect of opulence and power.</Q>&mdash;Of
<PB N="197" REF="219">
opulence and power, have the higher
cla&s;&s;es of our nation a deficient mea&s;ure?
I doubt, indeed, if they really po&s;&s;e&s;s, as
a body, or elegance or refinement. The
philo&s;opher is not dazzled by elegance
and refinement in manners; he does not
confound the brilliancy of equipages with
the energies of the mind. To his con|templative
eye it is po&s;&s;ible that an opu|lent
and &s;plendid nation may be barba|rous
and gro&s;s; as we ob&s;erve in the
individual, who, adorned by the in&s;ignia
of honour, and loaded with incalculable
wealth, may at the &s;ame time have all
the barbarity of mind which marks and
degrades the lowe&s;t of the populace.
Should the greater part of the nobility of
any country be more partial to pugili&s;ts
and jockies, than to arti&s;ts and philo&s;o|phers,
the hi&s;torian would be ju&s;tified in
recording that the genius of it's nobility
was barbarous and gro&s;s. It is almo&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="220">
peculiar to literature, that whenever it's
profe&s;&s;ors feel them&s;elves contemned or
neglected, to vindicate their cau&s;e, they
have only to record this contempt and
this neglect.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k why the art of writing is
not de&s;erving of the &s;ame regard as the
art of painting? And then I would en|quire,
what painting can urge in it's
own cau&s;e, which will entitle it to a &s;u|periority
over the art of compo&s;ition?</P>
<P>But it may be urged that an in&s;titution
of this kind, while it has been recom|mended
by &s;ome, has been oppo&s;ed by
others. Perhaps, in our country, it has
never been examined with the attention
&s;uch an object claims; often it's defects
have been rendered prominent, and it's
benefits omitted; it's inabilities have
been di&s;played, and it's powers have been
concealed; it has often been regarded as
a common place for ridicule, not as a
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion for rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="221">
John&s;on, in his Life of Swift, has
given &s;ome plau&s;ible arguments again&s;t
the academy which Swift propo&s;ed; the
arguments of this great man, more &s;pe|cious
than ju&s;t, relate not to our pre&s;ent
&s;ubject; for the academy Swift was de|&s;irous
of e&s;tabli&s;hing, was merely an imi|tation
of the French academy; for the
poli&s;hing, refining, and embelli&s;hing the
language. The Engli&s;h language now
wants no academy for it's improvements;
it has few acqui&s;itions to make, but much
to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>A literary in&s;titution might be formed,
in which the errors of former academies
might be obviated, and the advanced
genius of our times might add it's own
valuable inventions. To improve the
pa&s;t is not difficult; but whether &s;uch an
academy would be a national utility, is
an important que&s;tion, not, perhaps,
difficult to re&s;olve.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="222">
There is one kind of men, to whom
no &s;tudent would addre&s;s him&s;elf on &s;ub|jects
of &s;cience and ta&s;te. At the &s;iege
of Athens, the barbarous Sylla com|manded
the &s;hady walks of the ACADEMY
(that re&s;ort of the Mu&s;es which has left
it's name to all future literary &s;ocieties)
to be torn up, and the hallowed trees to
be converted into martial machines. I
addre&s;s my&s;elf not to the living Syllas,
who are as inimical to a modern, as their
ferocious model was to the fir&s;t academy.
The <HI>Omars</HI> of literature (the expre&s;&s;ion
be pardoned) we know are the enemies
of the <HI>Homers.</HI></P>
<P>On the fir&s;t glance we take of the &s;ub|ject,
the French academy, properly &s;o
di&s;tingui&s;hed, pre&s;ents it&s;elf. It's la|bours
have not been great; becau&s;e it's
object was limited to the cultivation of
the language. But it obtained it's ob|ject
with all it's po&s;&s;ible accompli&s;hment.
<PB N="201" REF="223">
I trace the hi&s;tory of French &s;tyle, in the
harangues of this academy. The fir&s;t
are cold, dry, and full of tho&s;e common
turns of expre&s;&s;ion, which were doubtle&s;s
con&s;idered as the <HI>curio&s;a felicitas,</HI> but
which, by their reiterated appearance,
&s;hew the barrenne&s;s of their diction, and
the paucity of happy expre&s;&s;ions. The
language was not yet formed; and the
academy had commenced with nearly an
empty trea&s;ury. About the middle vo|lumes,
eloquence occa&s;ionally appears,
an acce&s;&s;ion of new turns enrich the ha|rangues,
and if the &s;tyle is not yet &s;plen|did,
it is not devoid of grace. The con|cluding
volumes wear a brilliant appear|ance;
a warmth of colouring, a boldne&s;s
of expre&s;&s;ion, and all the &s;eduction of
animated eloquence. If the&s;e volumes
owe &s;omething to happier topics, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome &s;ubjects
not le&s;s intere&s;ting, in the early volumes,
have all the deficiencies of &s;tyle.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="224">
Some will urge that an author can
him&s;elf perform better than a &s;ociety,
and the dictionaries of Furetiere and
John&s;on, may be quoted as having been
performed without the aid of an aca|demy.</P>
<P>I would not deny that one &s;uperior
genius is capable of obtaining what forty
inferior ones can never accompli&s;h; and
I even add, that one great author can
perform better than forty great authors.
No celebrated work has yet been com|po&s;ed
by the united talents of &s;everal;
but many great men have conjoined their
abilities in vain, in various works.</P>
<P>The mechanical operation of compi|ling
a dictionary, however, I believe,
may be better effected by a &s;ociety, than
by an individual. The dictionary of
John&s;on, though perhaps it could not be
more finely executed, might have been
con&s;iderably augmented by a &s;ociety.
<PB N="203" REF="225">
Does not this great man him&s;elf, ho&s;tile
as he appears to academies, incon&s;ciou&s;ly
acknowledge their utility, by complain|ing
that his labour was not formed under
"the &s;helter of academic bowers."</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the happie&s;t
effect is obtained when an academy and
an individual unite their powers. I ex|plain
my&s;elf by the following circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>D'Alembert, in his Eloge of the Abb&egrave;
De&s;marais, ob&s;erves, that the long arti|cles
of the French dictionary were written
by him, and that the public con&s;idered
them as more fini&s;hed, and more &s;atis|factory
than the &s;hort ones. D'Alembert
gives the rea&s;on. He ob&s;erves, that
<Q REND="inline">the brevity of articles of little extent,
allowed of their being the work of the
whole &s;ociety; and that a &s;ociety col|lected
in a body, di&s;turbed in it's de|ci&s;ions
by twenty different opinions,
<PB N="204" REF="226">
which cro&s;s and de&s;troy one another,
mu&s;t with difficulty attain to &s;atisfy it|&s;elf
and it's readers; but, on the con|trary,
the great articles, indi&s;pen&s;ably
given to the care of an individual, ac|quire,
in pa&s;&s;ing through his hands,
all the perfection which the &s;elf-love of
the writer can give, animated al&s;o by
the academical fervour.</Q></P>
<P>This judicious reflection of one of the
mo&s;t judicious writers of France, may
&s;erve to prove that a work is be&s;t per|formed
by an individual; but that an
individual, while he labours under the
eye of a &s;ociety, feels a &s;timulative in
that &s;ociety, which otherwi&s;e had been
wanting.</P>
<P>And this is the great end and utility of
&s;uch an in&s;titution. It's various advan|tages
are, perhaps, &s;ufficiently obvious;
but the va&s;t influence it has over writers,
has not, perhaps, been &s;ufficiently re|marked.
<PB N="205" REF="227">
It animates not only the indi|viduals
of the &s;ociety, but every indivi|dual
who a&s;pires to become a member
of the &s;ociety, and to wear, as Voltaire
&s;aid, the blue ribband of literature. By
a di&s;tribution of prizes, it diffu&s;es an
emulation to the remote&s;t parts of the
kingdom, and introduces to the public
tho&s;e ingenuous youths, whom their &s;itu|ation
conceals from the world. By it's
own memoirs, written by the members,
it forms the mo&s;t valuable literary re|po&s;itories
in a nation. To reflect on
the&s;e advantages may not be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Some of the inferior benefits attending
&s;uch an in&s;titution, are indi&s;putable. In
the&s;e literary conferences, the ta&s;te of
every a&s;&s;ociate would become more bril|liant,
becau&s;e it would continually re|ceive
the attrition and contact, it is to
be &s;uppo&s;ed, of the fine&s;t under&s;tandings
<PB N="206" REF="228">
in the nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following ob&s;ervations on <HI>Academies,</HI> cited by Goujet in his Bibliotheque Francoi&s;e, vol. 2. p. 453, are from one of the numerous political works of the Abb&egrave; de Saint Pierre. They are too ingenious to be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">what &s;upplies among men the method of univer&s;ities, is the method of academies, or conferences which are held on mat|ters of their profe&s;&s;ion, or their ta&s;te.

They hear, with greater attention, tho&s;e who have acquired greater reputation in the com|pany; they improve by a reciprocation of ob&s;er|vations; they contradict their equals, and they are contradicted; and the authority of &s;ome, the con|tradiction of others, the dread of contempt or ridi|cule, the de&s;ire of applau&s;e, and of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing their equals; the wi&s;h of being u&s;eful to our country, animate all in their labour, and augment their ap|plication and attention, from which ari&s;es the growth and exten&s;ion of mind.</Q></P></NOTE> In ca&s;es of emergency,
recour&s;e would be had to the academy,
and a Robert&s;on would not &s;tand in &s;uch
need, as we have &s;een, of the advice of an
inferior mind. The paradoxes in poetry
of a John&s;on, would have been oppo&s;ed
before their publication, or at lea&s;t, the
work mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued into the world
<PB N="207" REF="229">
without the &s;anction of the academy,
which would have been a tacit cen&s;ure.
The &s;ociety &s;hould be provided with a&s;|&s;ociates
in the various cla&s;&s;es of litera|ture;
it &s;hould have it's grammarians,
it's hi&s;torians, and it's metaphy&s;icians,
as well as it's poets, it's orators, and it's
philo&s;ophers. In this hive of literary
bees, no indolent member &s;hould remain
a member; all mu&s;t be animation, all
mu&s;t be labour. And that no excu&s;e
may be framed of neglect to the cau&s;e of
literature, pen&s;ions &s;hould be given to
tho&s;e who may &s;tand in want of them;
for pen&s;ions to all will not be wanted,
&s;ince &s;ome will labour for glory, though
&s;ome may al&s;o want bread.</P>
<P>But even LITERARY PENSIONS have
been ridiculed; and it is not unnece&s;&s;ary
to offer &s;ome reflections on them.</P>
<P>There are two opinions relative to the
&s;tate of men of genius. One party ima|gine
<PB N="208" REF="230">
that no protection from the great,
or a court, is nece&s;&s;ary for the encou|ragement
of arti&s;ts; and the other are
per&s;uaded, that when honours and pen|&s;ions
are judiciou&s;ly di&s;tributed, it ex|cites
emulation in the young, and gives
that lei&s;ure to tho&s;e on whom they are
be&s;towed, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ome, to cul|tivate
their talents. They think with
Boileau, that
<Q>Un AUGUSTE ai&s;ement peut faire des VIRGILES.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orford, honourably known un|der
the name of Horace Walpole (a name
that pre&s;ents to the mind, ta&s;te, fancy,
and learning) has &s;aid in his preface to
his Anecdotes of Painting, <Q REND="inline">want of
protection is the apology for want of
genius. Milton and Fontaine did not
write in the ba&s;k of court favour. A
poet or a painter may want an equi|page,
or a villa, by wanting protection:
<PB N="209" REF="231">
they can always afford to buy ink and
paper, colours and pencil. Mr. Ho|garth
has received no honours, but
univer&s;al admiration.</Q></P>
<P>I reply to his Lord&s;hip, that it is true
the favour of a court knighted Blackmore,
and pen&s;ioned Quarles; and both were
mi&s;erable poets; but if a court cannot
convert dull men into men of genius, it
may pre&s;erve men of genius from be|coming
dull men. It might have af|forded
Dryden that &s;tudious lei&s;ure which
he ever wanted, and which has given us
imperfect tragedies, and incorrect poems,
in lieu of fini&s;hed compo&s;itions, and the
regular flights of a noble genius. It
might have animated a Gain&s;borough to
form an Engli&s;h &s;chool in land&s;cape,
which it is &s;aid was his favourite, but
neglected pur&s;uit. As for the equipage
and villa of the poet or the painter, the&s;e
they leave to the idle connoi&s;&s;eur and
<PB N="210" REF="232">
the vain actor. Nor mu&s;t we con&s;ent to
the in&s;ulting ob&s;ervation that they may
always buy ink and paper, colours and
pencils. Is it &s;ufficient for a delicate and
&s;en&s;itive mind to have &s;uch implements
to awaken the brilliancy of imagination?
Is the picture uncommon to &s;ee a great
genius with his pens or his pencils on the
table, leaning over them in that &s;ecret
agony of &s;pirit, which murders fancy,
and &s;preads a torpor on the &s;oul? Had
Chatterton been protected, not with an
equipage or a villa, but with a pen&s;ion,
the youth had not peri&s;hed; but this
unhappy poet in&s;tructs us, that pens and
paper are not the only requi&s;ites to cheri&s;h
genius.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, &s;o different are the
opinions of even men of letters on this
&s;ubject, the French writers (and the
greate&s;t of them received their pen&s;ions
without any injury to their genius) con|tinually
<PB N="211" REF="233">
point to England as a model of
literary protection. They tell us that
Addi&s;on was Secretary of State; Newton
and Locke, Commi&s;&s;ioners; Swift al|mo&s;t
Prime Mini&s;ter; and Prior an
Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>If it is urged that the public are the
be&s;t patrons, and that &s;everal popular
authors have left fervid expre&s;&s;ions as
memorials of their gratitude; I reply,
that the public are more munificent pa|trons
than princes, provided that the
genius of an author happens to take a
popular turn. But of authors, few can
be popular; for mo&s;t of the departments
in literature require the &s;tudy of many
years, and cannot be perfected till a late
period. Such are all the exact &s;ciences,
and every &s;pecies of erudition. The
hi&s;torian and the noveli&s;t may gratify the
public ta&s;te, but what is to become of
the antiquary and the mathematician?</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="234">
It is one certain evil, con&s;equent to the
want of patronage, that a writer of great
genius, when he di&s;covers that he has
nothing but his talents, and that the
public attention mu&s;t be rou&s;ed by &s;ome
extravagant novelty, will con&s;ult the
wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of the public; becau&s;e
the&s;e are the mo&s;t univer&s;al; and in&s;tead
of compo&s;ing a beautiful poem, he will
write a dreadful &s;atire; in&s;tead of a hi&s;|tory,
a libel; and in&s;tead of a moral
romance, &s;ome &s;candalous memoirs.</P>
<P>Men of genius, pen&s;ioned by a court,
will be enabled to indulge their own
manner, though it might not immedi|ately
be popular. He who writes in the
proper repo&s;e of mind, and with regu|larity
of application, will give his own
natural phy&s;iognomy, and not that arti|ficial
countenance which tho&s;e who court
the mob are obliged to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="235">
If I am told, that to accept pen&s;ions is
not congenial to the free &s;pirit of a Briton,
I reply, that literary pen&s;ions, unlike
others, are honourable to the donor, and
the pen&s;ioner. There is &s;urely le&s;s &s;er|vility
in receiving a gratuitous gift from
an enlightened monarch, than the wages
of an inhuman book&s;eller.</P>
<P>There is, I think, a reward for litera|ture,
of &s;till greater utility than even
pen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The di&s;tribution of PRIZES appears of
greater utility than PENSIONS. A pen&s;ion
pre&s;erves one man of letters, but a prize
may give birth to many. He who mu&s;t
&s;atisfy a judge, and &s;urpa&s;s a rival, will not
&s;atisfy him&s;elf till he has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf;
he will not try merely to give a good
work, but the be&s;t; and the vigilance of
ambition will &s;ometimes &s;upply the de|ficiencies
of genius. If he is not yet
crowned with the &s;plendid reward, he
<PB N="214" REF="236">
may merit the animation of an honour|able
notice; if he cannot obtain a tri|umph,
an ovation may be re&s;erved for
him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>ovation,</HI> among the Romans, was a <HI>le&s;&s;er tri|umph.</HI> At an ovation, the General entered the city on foot or on hor&s;ebock; but in a triumph he rode in a chariot.</NOTE> U&s;eful topics, which might not

Subjects of national importance are not
attempted becau&s;e a vender of literature
may not chu&s;e to undertake them; a

that France has always preceded us, and
that her ingenuity is made to &s;urpa&s;s our
genius.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>When the imperfect &s;ailing of our marine was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, January 6, in this year, Admiral Gardner al|ledged the following rea&s;on for the &s;uperiority of the French in this particular.

<P><PB N="215" REF="237">
While this academy for polite litera|ture
would be thus effecting a great na|tional
utility, their own memoirs would
be invaluable. The Academy of the
Belles Lettres in France, has formed a
collection of hi&s;torical, critical, literary,
and mi&s;cellaneous information, unequal|led
in any nation. Our mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed
hi&s;torians cite them as their
<PB N="216" REF="238">

age is rendered in&s;tructive; and what
becomes dull and in&s;ipid in a Salma&s;ius
and a Scaliger, delight with tho&s;e who
do not think knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in the
heavy and unprofitable &s;cience of dates,
unconnected facts, and titles of books;
but in reflection and in ta&s;te. Know|ledge
is only knowledge when it is render|ed
acce&s;&s;ible to the nation; it mu&s;t be
&s;hewn to, and handled by the multitude,
and not pre&s;erved like an u&s;ele&s;s piece of
antiquity in the collections of the curious.</P>
<P>France had literary &s;ocieties of every
kind; her provincial academies were
numerous; and I cannot but attribute her
&s;uperiority in a fine and brilliant elo|quence;
a language of critici&s;m that
analy&s;es and paints our &s;en&s;ations; and
their &s;eductive art of compo&s;ition to
the&s;e lettered confraternities. Her reli|gion
was friendly to retirement; and the
<PB N="217" REF="239">
retirement of &s;tudious men is rarely a
barren lei&s;ure, and a proud indolence.
It is a ju&s;tice we owe to letters, and to
an extinct order of men, to acknowledge
the invaluable labours of many mona&s;tic
&s;ocieties of modern times. To the Port
Royal the European youth were long in|debted
for the initiatory books of learn|ing,
and for ver&s;ions of the ancients, not yet
neglected. To the learned Benedictines
we owe their exten&s;ive "Literary Hi&s;tory
of France," which, though carried to
13 volumes in 4to. reaches only to the
12th century. Many, not le&s;s intere&s;ting,
nor va&s;t, might be mentioned. Labours
like the&s;e, can never be &s;atisfactorily per|formed
by any individual; One, may be
permitted to devote him&s;elf to the com|po&s;ition
of the work, but many hands and
many eyes mu&s;t collect the materials, and
mu&s;t watch over the execution. We
have no &s;uch Literary Hi&s;tory of Eng|land;
<PB N="218" REF="240">
and I may venture to predict we
never can, if an academy of polite lite|rature
is not in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>There remains one ob&s;ervation to be
made on the beneficial effect of literary
&s;ocieties di&s;per&s;ed in the kingdom.
Wherever &s;uch exi&s;t, there will never
appear in the vicinage a youth of genius,
but the members will perceive his abi|lities,
and will receive him or as a parent,
or as a friend. A con&s;iderable number
of the illu&s;trious literati of France, were
fir&s;t induced to devote them&s;elves to
&s;tudy by the penetration of their &s;upe|riors,
or having found an a&s;ylum in &s;ome
mona&s;tery, indulged their prevailing di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of literary &s;ocieties is
&s;o much de&s;ired, and the want is &s;o
urgent, that the di&s;cernment of indivi|duals
has of late attempted to &s;upply this
di&s;honourable deficiency by a&s;&s;ociations
<PB N="219" REF="241">
in the metropolis, as well as in &s;ome of
our provincial towns. The Manche&s;ter
&s;ociety has merited the approbation of
the public.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the plea&s;ure of announcing a volume of Mi&s;cellanies in the pre&s;s, by a LITERARY SOCIETY e&s;tabli&s;hed at EXETER. It is their fir&s;t fruits.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we cannot rea&s;onably expect that
a private &s;ociety will ever an&s;wer the
ideas of the public, and become of na|tional
utility. De Foe, in his "E&s;&s;ay
on Projects, (who projected millions
for the nation, but was generally con|fined
for his own debts) gives &s;ome ob|&s;ervations
re&s;pecting the in&s;titution of an
academy for polite literature, but he
chiefly regards it in the view of refining
and adju&s;ting the language. He &s;ays,
p. 229, that he was once a member of
a &s;ociety who attempted this noble de|&s;ign,
but it's failure he attributes to the
greatne&s;s of the work and the mode&s;ty of
<PB N="220" REF="242">
the gentlemen; and concludes by &s;aying
that we want a Richelieu to commence
&s;uch a work. I believe it was not the
mode&s;ty of the members, nor the great|ne&s;s
of the work, which occa&s;ioned it's
failure; but many other rea&s;ons, which
will always operate again&s;t private literary
&s;ocieties.</P>
<P>A &s;ociety of friends find no great dif|ficulty
to be plea&s;ed with the compo&s;i|tions
of each other; many will be ad|mitted
to &s;uch a &s;ociety, more out of
affection, than for their ability. It is
the great requi&s;ite of an academy, that
all the members &s;hould be profe&s;&s;ed &s;tu|dents,
who&s;e SOLE OCCUPATION is litera|ture,
and who&s;e life is devoted to acade|demical
functions. If PENSIONS and
PRIZES are added to the e&s;tabli&s;hment,
we have then as perfect an ACADEMY,
perhaps, as po&s;&s;ibly can exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="243">
This grand and de&s;irable object can
alone be obtained, as &s;uch hitherto have
been obtained, by the &s;anction of the
Sovereign, and the applau&s;e of the
People. Such an in&s;titution would not
alone be a national ornament; for to
hold out rewards to genius, and to dif|fu&s;e
among the people the humani&s;ing
and peaceful pur&s;uits of literature, has
never yet been con&s;idered by politicians
as a vain and an unimportant purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Such is the wonderful influence of a
love of letters in a nation, that it has
often di&s;gui&s;ed the deformity of de&s;po|ti&s;m,
and rendered even a nation of
&s;laves, a poli&s;hed, a refined, and a happy
people.</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ent melancholy moment,
when Europe appears ho&s;tile to Rea&s;on,
and to Humanity, let us indulge the
hope, that this in&s;titution may become
the ornament of PEACE&mdash;of a Peace, that
<PB N="222" REF="244">
by it's duration may re&s;emble the vi&s;ion
of an admirable philanthropi&s;t and a
poor politician, the vi&s;ion of the Abb&egrave;
de Saint Pierre,&mdash;AN UNIVERSAL PEACE.
When the principle of Government is
VIRTUE, the action of that Government
will be PEACE; Governments are, how|ever,
always in war.</P>

<P>I TAKE this opportunity of declaring, that having

by <HI>WILLIAM GRAHAM,</HI> re&s;pecting an Anecdote of
<HI>Mrs. MACAULEY'S</HI> mutilation of a Harleian MS.

<P>At pre&s;ent, the my&s;terious note of <HI>Dr. MORTON</HI>

<P>This, however, I concede, that I cannot <HI>prove</HI>
this circum&s;tance, for I was not born when it took
