<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Paper is a Sort of Bill of Complaint, be|gun many years &s;ince, and drawn up by &s;natches, as the &s;everal Occa&s;ions offer'd. I had no thoughts of publi&s;hing it, till it pleas'd &s;ome Per&s;ons of Rank and Fortune [the Authors of <HI>Ver&s;es to the Imitator of Horace,</HI> and of an <HI>Epi&s;tle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court,</HI>] to attack in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which being publick the Publick judge) but my <HI>Per&s;on, Morals,</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> whereof to tho&s;e who know me not, a truer Information may be requi&s;ite. Being di|vided between the Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>My&s;elf,</HI> and my own Lazine&s;s to undertake &s;o awkward a Task, I thought it the &s;horte&s;t way to put the la&s;t hand to this Epi&s;tle. If it have any thing plea&s;ing, it will be That by which I am mo&s;t de&s;irous to plea&s;e, the <HI>Truth</HI> and the <HI>Sentiment;</HI> and if any thing offen&s;ive, it will be only to tho&s;e I am lea&s;t &s;orry to offend, the <HI>Vicious</HI> or <HI>the Ungenerous.</HI></P>
<P>Many will know their own Pictures in it, there be|ing not a Circum&s;tance but what is true; but I have, for
<PB REF="3">
the mo&s;t part &s;par'd their <HI>Names,</HI> and they may e&s;cape being laugh'd at, if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I would have &s;ome of them know, it was owing to the Reque&s;t of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is in&s;cribed, that I make not as free u&s;e of theirs as they have done of mine. However I &s;hall have this Advan|tage, and Honour, on my &s;ide, that whereas by their pro|ceeding, any Abu&s;e may be directed at any man, no Injury can po&s;&s;ibly be done by mine, &s;ince a Namele&s;s Character can never be found out, but by its <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Likene&s;s.</HI></P>
