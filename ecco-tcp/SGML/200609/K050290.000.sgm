<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
UPON
LOANS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING Treated in brief
upon the Difficult Subject
of <HI>Credit,</HI> and that, if (the
Town is not a Deceiver),
with &s;ome Succe&s;s; it &s;eems
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak a Word or two upon
the great Object, upon which that Cre|dit
Operates, <HI>viz. Loans of Money</HI> up|on
the Publick Demands.</P>
<P>The Author, <HI>an Enemy to long Pre|faces,</HI>
pre&s;ents his Thoughts to the
World upon this Head, without any o|ther
Apology than this, That he thinks it
a Service at this time, to remove the
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Mi&s;takes which &s;ome make, and others
improve to our Di&s;advantage, while
they think it is to the Di&s;advantage of
&s;ome Body el&s;e: While they aim at
an Object they would hurt, they Wound
them&s;elves; and in Pro&s;ecuting private
or Party-Prejudices, Injure, Weaken, and
A&s;&s;ault the Publick Good; which every
Man has a Property in, and therefore is
in Duty bound to Defend.</P>
<P>A Di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>Credit,</HI> is naturally
an Introduction to a Di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>Loan</HI>;
<HI>Credit</HI> without <HI>Loan</HI> is a Beautiful Flower,
fair to the Eye, fragrant to the Smell, or|namental
to the Plot of Ground it grows
in; but yielding neither Fruit nor Seed,
neither Profit to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, by
making due Advantage of its Produce, or
Benefit to Po&s;terity, by Propagation of its
Species. On the other Hand, <HI>Loans</HI> with|out
<HI>Credit</HI> are like the Labouring Plow|man
upon a Barren Soil, who Works,
Cultivates, Sweats, and Toils, but to no
purpo&s;e, all the Fruit of his Labour, ends
in Sterility and Abortion.</P>
<P><HI>Loans</HI> are the Con&s;equences of <HI>Credit,</HI>
and the Evidence of that particular Qua|lity,
which in the preceding Di&s;cour&s;e of
<HI>Credit,</HI> I lay'd down as its Foundation; I
mean General Probity, Punctual, Ju&s;t,
and Honourable Management.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
To explain Things as I go; tho' this
needs but little: By <HI>Loans,</HI> I am now to be
under&s;tood to mean, <HI>Lending Money to the
pre&s;ent Government</HI>: The Thing will ex|tend
to private Affairs, and I might take
up a great deal of your Time, in &s;peak|ing
of the Effects of <HI>Credit</HI> in Trade, &s;uch
as delivering Goods by Trade&s;men to
one another, Paper-Credit in Affairs of
Ca&s;h; Pledging, Pawning, and all the
Articles of Security for Money, practis'd
in General Commerce; but the&s;e Things
are not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Author of this, confines his Di&s;|cour&s;e
to the Government Borrowing
Money of the Subject, whether upon Se|curities
E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Parliament equi|valent
in Value deliver'd, publick Faith,
general Credit, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Nature of the&s;e Securities, the Rea|&s;on,
the U&s;efulne&s;s, and the Foundation
they &s;tand on, are no part of the pre&s;ent
Subject; they are re&s;erv'd by the Author
to a Head by them&s;elves, if Lei&s;ure and
the publick Service make it proper to pre|&s;ent
you a Di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>Funds.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent War, which, with a &s;mall
Interval of an un&s;etled and Impolitick
Peace, is now in its 22d Year, has
been remarkable in &s;everal Circum&s;tances,
above all the Wars that ever this Nation
<PB N="6" REF="6">
has been Engag'd in, &s;ince the <HI>Roman's</HI>
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>It has been,<LIST>
<ITEM>The longe&s;t in it's Duration</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Fierce&s;t and mo&s;t Expen&s;ive in
Blood;</ITEM>
<ITEM>The mo&s;t Famous in Succe&s;&s;es, and un|heard
of Victories;</ITEM>
<ITEM>It has been carry'd on again&s;t the mo&s;t
Powerful Enemies;</ITEM>
<ITEM>It has produc'd the mo&s;t firm, and the
Greate&s;t Confederacy;</ITEM>
<ITEM>And it has in View, the mo&s;t Glorious
Conclu&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Together with the&s;e Things, it has
this al&s;o peculiar to it; that it has been
carry'd on at an Expence, which has &s;ur|mounted
not all that ever went before it
only, but all that it could be imagin'd, was
po&s;&s;ible for any Nation of our Dimen&s;i|ons
in the World, to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Not the <HI>Fr.</HI> King only has been deceiv'd
in the Efforts made by this Nation in the
Proce&s;s of the War; which, as penetra|ting
as he is, he never thought po&s;&s;ible;
but is is mo&s;t certain, had the wi&s;e&s;t and
be&s;t Calculator in the I&s;land been told
what the Undertaking would have call'd
for, he would have determined it to be
forty Millions Sterling beyond what the
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">
Nation was able to do, and that without
&s;elling the very Nation, it could not be
done.</P>
<P>As the view of the Expence would have
made us wi&s;ely have avoided the War,
and either not have begun it, or long
&s;ince ended it, upon the be&s;t Terms we
could obtain from the Enemy; &s;o had
the Enemy believed <HI>England</HI> capable of
&s;upporting the War, at &s;uch a prodigy of
Expence, he would never have begun it;
which the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf has been
heard, in Terms very plain, to acknow|ledge.</P>
<P>When upon the Revolution the Parli|ment
fell mo&s;t willingly into the War, as
a thing the Enemy, by e&s;pou&s;ing King
<HI>James</HI>'s Intere&s;t, made ab&s;olutely Nece&s;|&s;ary:
The fir&s;t Brach of our Expence
was carried on in the common Road of
levying Taxes, and the Money required
for every Years Expence was rai&s;ed and
paid within the Year.</P>
<P>The Nation was rich, Trade prodigi|ou&s;ly
great, Paper-Credit run high, and
the Gold&s;miths in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> &amp;c.
commanded immen&s;e Summs; Antici|pations
were indeed in Practice, they
had been &s;o of Old, and borrowing Clau&s;es
were added to the Bills of Aid; but the&s;e
la&s;ted but a few Months, the Money
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y">
came in of cour&s;e, and they were paid
off in their turn: Land-Tax, Polls, ad|ditional
Duties of Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, and
the like, were the Ways and Means by
which the&s;e things were done; the Year
generally &s;upported its own Demands,
all the Loans were &s;uppo&s;ed to be Tem|porary,
and to end with the Collection.</P>
<P>As the War every Year grew heavier
upon us, and the Expence increa&s;ed, new
Ways and Means were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|ply
the growing Demand, till all the
Taxes that could be rai&s;ed, by the ordi|nary
Way, were found little enough to
bring the Annual Expence about.</P>
<P>This put the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the
Trea&s;ury upon li&s;tening to new Taxes,
and entertaining all the Projects for rai&s;|ing
Money, that the working Heads of
the Age could &s;upply them with.</P>
<P>The&s;e, back'd with Parliamentary Au|thority,
were too unadvi&s;edly &s;uppo&s;ed
to rai&s;e &s;uch certain Summs as the Pub|lick
Occa&s;ions then call'd for, and borrow|ing
Clau&s;es were added to them, limit|ting
the &s;aid Summs; which pa&s;s'd as a
giving the Trea&s;ury Credit upon the Acts
of Parliament for &s;uch Summs as they
were granted for; but the Collections
falling infinitely &s;hort of the Summs pro|po&s;ed,
left the Publick in Arrear to the
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y">
Lenders, and from hence came the great
Load of Deficiencies, which the Nation
feels the Weight of to this Hour.</P>
<P>As the Summs given fell &s;hort, &s;o the
War called every Year for &s;till greater
Summs; which added to the Deficiencies
of the old Taxes, grew &s;o heavy, that
our Mannagers found it was in vain to
&s;truggle with the Difficulty any Longer,
upon the foot of Annual Taxes; and that
it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e every
Year what the publick Occa&s;ions call'd
for.</P>
<P>This lead them of cour&s;e to a new Me|thod
to &s;upply the great Demands of the
War, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by E&s;tabli&s;hing Annual Re|ceipts
of limited or perpetual Intere&s;ts for
&s;uch Summs, as might be borrowed upon
the Credit of the Nation, the Principal to
&s;ink in the Hands of the Publick. The&s;e
were call'd FUNDS.</P>
<P>To encourage the People to lend upon
the&s;e Funds, Premioes for advancing the
Money, large Intere&s;ts, and other Ad|vantages
were annex'd; &s;uch as 14 <HI>per
Cent. per Annum</HI> upon Annuities, with
Survivour&s;hip, Chance of Prizes by way
of Lottery, 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon Exchequer
Bills, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Here, together with the innumerable Tal|lies,
which upon the Deficiency of former
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Taxes as afore&s;aid, went about the Town
upon Di&s;count, and the great Ob&s;tructi|on
of running Ca&s;h, by calling in the old
Coin, was the fir&s;t ri&s;e given to the Art
and My&s;tery of Stock-Jobbing; a Pra|ctice,
whether good or evil in its Con&s;e|quences
to the publick Affairs, is not to
the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to enquire.</P>
<P>By this Method has the greate&s;t part
of our Yearly Taxes, &s;ince that time, been
rai&s;ed; the Parliament E&s;tabli&s;hing Funds
for payment of Intere&s;t, and the People
advanving Money, by way of Loan, on
tho&s;e Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here for &s;ome
People to reflect, That in the Advantages
granted by the Government upon the&s;e
Loans, and the great Di&s;counts upon Tal|lies
on the deficient Aids, mentioned a|bove,
were founded the great &s;tocks of
Money, Banks and powerful Credit;
with which &s;ome People are grown to
&s;uch a height, e&s;pecially in their own O|pinion,
as to talk of influencing the pub|lick
Affairs, and as it were menacing the
Government with Apprehen&s;ions of their
Lending or not Lending, as they are, or
are not plea&s;ed with the Management of,
or Managers in the publick Oeconomy;
and this is the Subject I am a little to
&s;peak to.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11" MS="y">
LOANS to the Government, by the
Gradations afore&s;aid, having been found
e&s;&s;entially Nece&s;&s;ary, the fir&s;t Steps to
that new Method were found fatally In|cumbering;
the high <HI>Premio's</HI> given, the
great Advantages propo&s;ed, and the large
Intere&s;ts paid to the Lender. The Go|vernment
appear'd like a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Deb|tor,
who was every Day &s;queez'd to Death
by the exorbitant greedine&s;s of the Len|der;
the Citizens began to decline Trade
and turn U&s;erers; Foreign Commerce
attended with the hazards of War, had
infinite Di&s;couragements, and the People
in general drew home their Effects, to
embrace the Advantage of lending their
Money to the Government. Then grew
up the BANK, who&s;e &s;econd Sub&s;cripti|on
being founded upon a Parliamentary
Security, for making good the deficient
Tallies; was formed by receiving in tho&s;e
Tallies at <HI>Par,</HI> which co&s;t the Sub&s;cribers
but 55 to 65 <HI>per Cent</HI>; by which the
greate&s;t E&s;tates were rai&s;ed in the lea&s;t
time, and the mo&s;t of them, that has been
known in any Age, or in any part of the
World.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, turn'd the whole City in|to
a Corporation of U&s;ury, and they ap|pear'd
not as a <HI>Bank,</HI> but rather one ge|neral
Society of Bankers; all Men that
<PB N="12" REF="12" MS="y">
could draw any Money out of their
Trades, run with it to <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
to buy Stocks and Tallies, Sub&s;cribe
to Banks or Companies; or to the
Exchequer with it to put into Loans,
and lend it upon the advantageous FUNDS
&s;ettled by Parliament.</P>
<P>It is meet to mention the&s;e things, for
the &s;ake of the People who have gotten
&s;uch great E&s;tates by the Government, to
let them know from whence the Advan|tages
they have made, did proceed; and
al&s;o for &s;ome other Rea&s;ons which will
appear in the &s;equel of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Government, to pre&s;erve to them|&s;elves
the Advantage of the&s;e Loans, and
yet to avoid being Impo&s;ed upon and
Oppre&s;t by tho&s;e exorbitant Intere&s;ts
and Encouragements, about the Year
1698. entered into Mea&s;ures to &s;ecure the
Loan of Money, and yet lower the Ad|vantages
given to the Lenders.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was done by the Parliament,
apylying them&s;elves to re&s;tore <HI>Credit,</HI> by
a Vote to make good all Deficiencies, and
Erecting a punctual, ju&s;t, and fair Ma|nagement
of the Payments; by which
every &s;everal Engagement being Honou|rably
complyed with, the Credit of the
publick Affairs reviv'd, and the Exorbi|tances
the former Years were expo&s;ed to,
wore off of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
This tedious Recapitulation of Things
will appear le&s;s trouble to the Reader,
when he &s;ees the u&s;e I &s;hall make of it.</P>
<P>Here may be &s;een &s;everal Things,
which, if well con&s;idered, tend to the
lowring the high and extravagant Ima|ginations
of &s;ome People, with re&s;pect to
<HI>Loans, Credit, Borrowing</HI> and <HI>Lending</HI> of
Money to the Government; &s;uch as
the&s;e.<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Large Intere&s;t, Advantages,
<HI>Premio's</HI> for advance of Money, and
the like, will bring in <HI>Loans</HI> in &s;pight
of Parties, in &s;pight of Deficiencies,
in &s;pight of all the Con&s;piracies in
the World to the contrary; while
a ju&s;t, honourable, and punctual Per|formance
on the part of the Govern|ment,
does but maintain the Credit
of the Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. As the Affairs of the Govern|ment
have made <HI>Loans</HI> nece&s;&s;ary,
and they can not go on without Bor|rowing;
&s;o the &s;tream of Trade and
Ca&s;h is &s;o Univer&s;ally turn'd into
publick Funds, the whole Ntia|on
feels &s;o much of gains, &s;o much by,
and depends &s;o much upon the pub|lick
Credit, that they can no more
<PB N="14" REF="14">
do without the Funds, than the
Funds can do without the Loan.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The&s;e Borrowings and Lend|ings
are become &s;o much a Trade,
&s;o many Families have their Em|ployment
from, and get &s;o great
E&s;tates by the Negotiating the&s;e
Things, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any
particular Sett of Men to put a &s;top
to it; or to get any &s;uch Power in|to
their Hands, as to give the Go|vernment
ju&s;t Grounds of Ap|prehen&s;ion,
that this or that Party
of Men can put a Cheque to the
publick Affairs, be they <HI>Whigs, To|ries,</HI>
<HI>City, Court, Banks, Company,</HI>
or what they plea&s;e to call them|&s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I &s;hall not tye my &s;elf to &s;peak to the&s;e
apart, <HI>the liberty of this Tract will not ad|mit
of it,</HI> but in a Summary way you will
find the Fact Demon&s;trated, and the
Con&s;equence Evident.</P>
<P>Men in Trade, more e&s;pecially than the
re&s;t of Mankind, are bound by their Inte|re&s;t;
Gain is the end of Commerce, where
that Gain vi&s;ibly attends the Adventurer,
as no Hazard can di&s;courage, &s;o no other
Obligation can prevent the Application<Q>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
To pretend after this, that Parties &s;hall
Govern Mankind again&s;t their Gain, is
to Philo&s;ophize wi&s;ely upon what <HI>may be,</HI>
and what would be Politick to bring to
pa&s;s; but what no Man can &s;ay was ever
put in Practi&s;e to any Perfection; or can
be &s;o by the common Principles that Go|vern
Mankind in the World.</P>
<P>There have been Combinations in
Trade, and People have &s;eem'd to act
counter to their pre&s;ent Intere&s;ts; nay,
have gone on in apparent Lo&s;s, in pur|&s;uance
of &s;uch Combinations; but they
have always been made in order to &s;ecure
a Return of greater Gain; and therefore
the Laws made again&s;t &s;uch Combinati|ons,
are not made to prevent Peoples go|ing
on to their Lo&s;s, but to prevent the
end of that appearing Lo&s;s; <HI>viz.</HI> the In|gro&s;&s;ment
or Monopolizing of Trade, to
come at &s;ome Advantage over others, and
thereby make an exorbitant Gain.</P>
<P>But it was never yet heard, that the
Zeal of any Party got the better &s;o much
of their Intere&s;t, as to put a general Stop
to the current and natural Stream of their
Intere&s;t; that a People &s;hould reject the
fair and ju&s;t Advantages which have rai|&s;ed
&s;o many E&s;tates, and are the due
Supplies to the Breaches made by the
War upon general Commerce. To talk,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
that we will not lend Money to the Go|vernment,
while the Parliament &s;ettles
Funds, allows Intere&s;ts, gives <HI>Premio's</HI>
and Advantages, is to &s;ay, Nature will
cea&s;e, Men of Money will ab&s;tain from
being Men loving to get Money. That
Trade&s;men &s;hould cea&s;e to &s;eek Gain, and
U&s;erers to love large Intere&s;ts; that Men
that have gain'd Money &s;hould leave off
de&s;iring to get more; and that Zeal to a
Party &s;hould prevail over Zeal to their
Families; that Men &s;hould forfeit their
Intere&s;t for their Humour, and &s;erve
their Politicks at the price of their In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e that promi&s;e them&s;elves the&s;e
things, enquire among the Merchants,
and &s;ee if Parties govern any thing in
Trade; if there is either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI>
in a good Bargain; Churchman or Di&s;|&s;enter
in a good Freight; High Church
or Low Church in a Good Adventure;
if a Shop-keeper &s;ees a good Penny|worth,
a Scrivener a good Mortgage, a
Money'd Man a good Purcha&s;e; Do they
ever ask what Party he is of that parts
with it? Nay, rather in &s;pight of Party
Aver&s;ions, do we not Buy, Sell, Lend,
Borrow, enter into Companies, Partner|&s;hips,
and the clo&s;e&s;t Engagements with
oen another, nay Marry with one ano|ther
<PB N="17" REF="17">
without any Que&s;tions of the Mat|ter?</P>
<P>Let us come to the general Body of
People as Fate has unhappily divided us;
where are the Men? &s;uppo&s;ing a Party
Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Government in
this matter of Loan; Where are the Men
who would hold together, and refu&s;e
making &s;even <HI>per Cent.</HI> of their Money to
pre&s;erve the Engagement? Where the
Men who would &s;tay their Hands, and
lo&s;e the probability of gaining a Thou|&s;and
Pounds a Year by a Lottery? <HI>No,</HI>
<HI>no,</HI> it is not to be done; the &s;tream of
De&s;ire after Gain runs too &s;trong in Man|kind,
to bring any thing of that kind to
Perfection in this Age. The thing is &s;o
impracticable in its Nature, that it &s;eems
a Token of great Ignorance in the Hu|mour
of the Age to &s;ugge&s;t it; and a
Man would be tempted to think tho&s;e
People that do &s;ugge&s;t it, do not them|&s;elves
believe what they &s;ay about it.</P>
<P>In the matter of Loan it next comes
in our way to enquire, how does the
Ca&s;h of the Nation, which is the thing we
are upon, &s;tand divided, and how is the Go|vernment
in hazard of any Combinati|on
of this kind? If it be po&s;&s;ible to make
this Enquiry without any Party By a&s;s,
and &s;o as to give Offence to neither &s;ide,
<PB N="18" REF="18">
it &s;hall be done. I do not &s;ay who is in,
or who out; who has the Management,
who had it, or who would have it; let
that &s;tand as it does, or may; but how
do the Parties &s;tand, with re&s;pect to one
another; &s;uppo&s;ing any one Party would
endeavour to &s;tagnate the general Circu|lation
of Credit, in Prejudice of the other:
As for the purpo&s;e;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Whig Admini&s;tration, and all
the High Church Men and their Appen|dices
in hopes to reduce them to Exigen|ces
in the Management, &s;hould Con|&s;pire
together to run down the Publick
Credit, and lend no Money on any of
the Funds. <HI>Vice Ver&s;a</HI>; &s;uppo&s;e a Rever&s;e,
and the Whigs in general &s;hould do the
&s;ame thing: Let us enquire; Are either of
the&s;e Parties &s;so rich in Ca&s;h, &s;o power|ful
in Lending, that all the <HI>Loans</HI> mu&s;t
depend upon their Money; or are either
of the&s;e Parties &s;o incon&s;iderable in this
Ca&s;e, that their Support &s;hall &s;ignify no|thing
without the concurrence of the o|ther?
If the la&s;t were true, that weak
Party could make no manner of Figure
in this Government, or be &s;ignificant e|nough
for the Sovereign without vi&s;ible
Di&s;traction to engage with. To de&s;cend
to Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
The Notion is general, at lea&s;t among
them&s;elves, that the Gro&s;s of the Ca&s;h
is with the Whigs; and the <HI>Review</HI>
&s;peaks of it as a thing capable of &s;ome
Demon&s;trations; tho' with his good li|king,
it may be &s;aid, he may be mi&s;taken.
Some have gone a length beyond the
Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> and will have it,
that the Money lies in the Hands of the
Di&s;&s;enters; and will allow the Church|men,
e&s;pecially the High-Church-Men
to have little enough for them&s;elves,
and by con&s;equence le&s;s to &s;pare to the
Publick Loans.</P>
<P>Others will tell you, the High-Church-Party
have a large &s;hare of the Nation's
Ca&s;h in their Hands; that they have ge|nerally
a Proportion of Money, and
beyond Compari&s;on more Land than the
other. They add, That as they have
more Land, they can when they plea&s;e
have more Money; and that therefore
tho' they &s;hould grant that the Low-Church
and Di&s;&s;enters put together, have
the mo&s;t ready Money, yet allowing
them the Superiority in the Lands, they
can fetch the Money into their own
Hands when they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not for me to determine who
has mo&s;t Land, or who mo&s;t Money;
it is my Opinion, neither have &s;o much
<PB N="20" REF="20">
or &s;o little, as to render them Formidable
or Contemptible to one another in the
Matter of Loan. Both Sides have enough
to be u&s;eful to, and both Sides have little
enough to &s;tand in need of one another;
and in this Divi&s;ion the Ballance of Parties
(which at this time is the onely Felicity
that we can find in having any Parties at
all,) does con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I make no Difficulty to Acknowledge,
That where the Land is, there is the
Foundation of all the real Wealth in the
Nation: I do not &s;ay, it is in this or that
Party exclu&s;ive; That the Gentlemen,
who call them&s;elves of the High-Party,
have a great &s;hare of the Land, is mo&s;t
certain, but that they have &s;o much
more than the Whigs and Di&s;&s;enters
join'd, as &s;ome will alledge, I cannot de|termine.
No doubt where the Land is,
there can be no want of Money, becau&s;e
Land will at any time rai&s;e Money;
whereas Money, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Trade, Landed-men, or Governments,
can operate no way, but like the Viper,
preying upon it &s;elf.</P>
<P>This leads me to Examine the
Difference between <HI>Loan</HI> and <HI>Fund</HI> in
this Ca&s;e. Examining which, &s;omething
may perhaps come to light for our In&s;tru|ction,
<PB N="21" REF="21" MS="y">
which has not been much thought
of before,</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>The Borrower is Ser|vant
to the Lender</HI>; but with the Wi&s;e|man's
leave, in this Ca&s;e it is not &s;o.
<HI>Solomon</HI> is there to be under&s;tood &s;peaking
of the poor borrowing Wretch, who Bor|row'd
upon the Foot of Charity and
Compa&s;&s;ion, and therefore he ju&s;t before
&s;ays, <HI>The Poor u&s;es many Entreaties, but
the Rich an&s;wer roughly.</HI> The poor Man
that Borrows on his &s;ingle Promi&s;e to &s;up|ply
his urgent Nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>u&s;es Entreaties,</HI>
as we may &s;ay, <HI>He Begs to Borrow</HI>; but
the <HI>rich Lender</HI> is &s;urly, hardly con&s;ents,
<HI>an&s;wers Roughly,</HI> and is with Difficulty
brought to Lend.</P>
<P>But we are to Di&s;tingui&s;h here between
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Borrower de&s;crib'd as above, and
he that Borrows on a &s;ufficient current
Security: He is no more Servant to the
Lender than the Lender is Servant to
him; having an unque&s;tion'd Security to
give, he &s;corns to ask you twice; but if
you do not think fit to lend your Money,
he goes to another.</P>
<P>This is apparent in the <HI>Public Secu|rities,</HI>
as well as in private; and will
make it out, if ever put to the Te&s;t,
That the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;tand in as
much need of <HI>the Funds</HI> to lend their
<PB N="22" REF="22" MS="y">
Money upon, as the Government &s;tands
in need of their Money <HI>upon tho&s;e Funds.</HI>
I prove this by a matter of Fact, fre&s;h in
your Memories, and undeniable in all
its Circum&s;tances. In the Beginning of
the War, when the Money lay abroad in
TRADE, the Knowledge of Affairs young,
and the People not apprized of the thing;
the Anticipations upon Taxes and Loans
came heavy, and were &s;mall, <HI>What drew
them on?</HI> Large Premio's, high Intere&s;ts,
Chances of Prizes, Survivor&s;hip, and the
like.</P>
<P>Thus when the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Go|vernment
were great and their Credit
young to Borrow, the Lenders made their
Market: But when the Government
found them&s;elves <HI>rich in Funds,</HI> their
Demands, <HI>tho' great,</HI> yet not pre&s;&s;ing;
Credit E&s;tabli&s;h'd, the Parliament, <HI>the
great Fund of Funds,</HI> and Center of
Credit, ready to make good Deficiencies,
and leaving no room for Jealou&s;ies in the
Minds of the People, <HI>What was the
Ca&s;e?</HI> You took off your Premio's, you
drew no more Lotteries for 16 Years,
you lower'd your Intere&s;t, you brought
your Annuities from 14 to 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
and your Intere&s;t on Tallies from 7 to 6
<HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI> From 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon
Exchequer-Bills, you came down to 4
<PB N="23" REF="23" MS="y">
<HI>per Cent.</HI> And what was the Con&s;equence?
The Nece&s;&s;ity of the Lenders being
more to lodge their Money for Improve|ment,
than the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Borrow|ers
was to ask, they came always down
to your Price; and had you brought the
general Intere&s;t of Loans to 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
they mu&s;t have come down, for Money
is no longer Money than it can be im|prov'd.
<HI>Nay, it is to be ob&s;erv'd,</HI> the
Eagerne&s;s of the People to bring in their
Money encrea&s;ed, as the Advantages of
Lending decrea&s;ed: Having no way to
improve it better, they were under an
ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing it in, for
the &s;ake of the Improvement.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e any of the People, who can
be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay to the Parliament,
They will not lend their Money? It
would almo&s;t provoke a Man to laugh at
them. You won't lend your Money!
Why, what will you do with it?</P>
<P>Perhaps you wont lend it to the Go|vernment,
<HI>well</HI> you will <HI>then</HI> lend it upon
private Security, upon Land, and the
like; why then tho&s;e you lend it to, will
lend it to the Government, and &s;o the
Malice of the Affair will be lo&s;t, and the
Advantage too. Will you run it into
Trade? <HI>Do &s;o by all means.</HI> Some of
tho&s;e Hands it will Circulate through,
<PB N="24" REF="24">
will lend it to the Government. Your
very <HI>Export</HI> and <HI>Import</HI> is a Loan to the
Government. In &s;hort, the Govern|ment
&s;hall have your Money <HI>fir&s;t or la&s;t,</HI>
do what you will with it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it were po&s;&s;ible to divide this
Nation into two Parts, the Landed-men
and the Money'd-men, and the Govern|ment
were to be put into the Hands of
the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> again&s;t the Con&s;ent of the <HI>Last</HI>;
and the Money'd-men knowing the Land|ed-men
could not carry on the War with|out
Money, re&s;olv'd to lend them none,
I mean as a Government, What Cour&s;e
&s;hould the Landed-men take?</P>
<P>In my Opinion, they &s;hould pa&s;s an
Act, That none of tho&s;e People &s;hould
be admitted to lend any Money to the
Government at all; What then would
be the Con&s;equence? They would be
immediately di&s;tre&s;s'd with the Weight
of Money without Improvement; they
would eagerly lend it to the Landed-men
at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Land; and
they again lending it to the Government
at 6 and 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Government
would be &s;upply'd, and the Landed-men
would get 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> by the other Mens
Money.</P>
<P>I am not making Application; but let
any of the pre&s;ent Parties, who Boa&s;t of
<PB N="25" REF="25">
their having the Gro&s;s of the Money,
reflect what they would &s;ay, if an Act
were to pa&s;s, That no <HI>Whig</HI>'s Money, or
no <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI>'s Money, or no High-Church|man's
Money &s;hould be accepted upon
Loan; That they &s;hould not be allow'd
a Transfer upon any Stock, or to Buy
any Annuity; the Complaint would be
very loud of their being excluded the
common Advantages of their Fellow-Subjects;
and that paying their Share of
Taxes, they ought to have room for equal
Improvements, and ought not to be ex|cluded;
<HI>and this is true too,</HI> it would
be hard. Then they would run about
to their Friends among the contrary
Party, &s;helter their Money under their
Names, and perhaps give &frac12; <HI>per Cent.</HI> or
1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion to others to Lend,
Buy and Transfer for them: And what
would the Government feel in all this?</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is this, No Party can be
&s;o fooli&s;h to think they can be able &s;top the
Loan of Money to the Government; nor
need the Government think of putting the
Laws in Execution again&s;t &s;uch Combi|nation
(<HI>tho' if any &s;uch appear'd, no doubt
they might be pro&s;ecuted.</HI>) Keep up but
the Credit of Parliament, and let that
Parliament find Funds, it is not in the
Power of any Party of Men to Stop
<PB N="26" REF="26">
the Current of Loans, any more than
they can Stop the Tide at <HI>London-Bridge,</HI>
in its con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Flux and Re|flux
from and to the Sea.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the <HI>French</HI> have
Agents amons us, who would be glad to
weaken our Hands in the War, and pre|vent
our Supplies for that Purpo&s;e: From
them it mu&s;t be that the&s;e Notions creep
into Peoples Heads; <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men cannot
in their common Sen&s;es be &s;o weak; tel|ling
us that we &s;hall have no <HI>Loans,</HI> is
much at one to telling us we &s;hall have
no Recruits to our Army; as, while you
can Pay Armies, you &s;hall never want
Men; &s;o while you can pay Intere&s;t, you
&s;hall never want <HI>Loans.</HI></P>
<P>The E&s;tates that &s;ome Men boa&s;t of,
by which they are enabled to Lend, and
made bold enough to threaten a &s;top of
it, were gain'd by Lending. Tho&s;e that
have them are too eager to Encrea&s;e them,
tho&s;e that want them too eager to Gain
them, by the &s;ame method, and all too
Covetous and too Selfi&s;h not to come into
any good Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The Wor&s;t the&s;e Men can do, is, by ma|king
things appear backward, to rai&s;e the
Rate of Intere&s;ts, and move the Parliament
to add &s;omething to the u&s;ual Encourage|ments
for lending; and if the Nation pays
<PB N="27" REF="27">
this, who have they to blame for it? Yet
neither will they be able to do this, the
pre&s;ent Credit of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament
putting it out of their Power; for as the
nece&s;&s;ity of Lending will prompt on one
Hand, the undoubted Security of Parlia|mentary
Credit removes all the Jealou&s;ies
our Party-men would rai&s;e on the other.</P>
<P>The Zeal &s;ome Men &s;hew for their
Country, as well as Ju&s;tice to the Govern|ment,
is neverthele&s;s very Con&s;picuous in
this; who (fir&s;t) to glorifie their Party-Pre|judices
would have the War mi&s;carry, ra|ther
than Money &s;hould be lent, while &s;uch
Men Manage as they pretend not to like;
(&s;econdly) reproach &s;ome People with De|&s;igns
to make Peace with <HI>France,</HI> and yet
endeavour by di&s;couraging <HI>Loans</HI> to render
it impo&s;&s;ible for them to carry on the War.</P>
<P>But both the&s;e will be di&s;appointed:
While the Parliament Supports Credit,
and good Funds Support the Parliament,
Money will come in as naturally, as Fire
will a&s;cend, or Water flow; nor will it
be in the Power of our wor&s;t Enemies to
prevent it.</P>
