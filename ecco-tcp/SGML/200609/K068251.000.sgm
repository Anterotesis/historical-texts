<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public may depend on the
following fragments as genuine
remains of ancient Scotti&s;h poetry. The
date of their compo&s;ition cannot be ex|actly
actly a&s;certained. Tradition, in the
country where they were written, refers
them to an aera of the mo&s;t remote anti|quity:
and this tradition is &s;upported by
the &s;pirit and &s;train of the poems them|&s;elves;
which abound with tho&s;e
ideas, and paint tho&s;e manners, that
belong to the mo&s;t early &s;tate of &s;o|ciety.
The diction too, in the origi|nal,
is very ob&s;olete; and differs wide|ly
from the &s;tyle of &s;uch poems as have
been written in the &s;ame language two
or three centuries ago. They were cer|tainly
compo&s;ed before the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
of clan&s;hip in the northern part
of Scotland, which is it&s;elf very an|cient;
for had clans been then formed
and known, they mu&s;t have made a con|&s;iderable
figure in the work of a Highland
Bard; whereas there is not the lea&s;t men|tion
of them in the&s;e poems. It is remark|able
that there are found in them no allu|&s;ions
to the Chri&s;tian religion or wor&s;hip;
indeed, few traces of religion of any kind.
One circum&s;tance &s;eems to prove them
to be coeval with the very infancy of
Chri&s;tianity in Scotland. In a frag|ment
of the &s;ame poems, which the
tran&s;lator has &s;een, a Culdee or Monk
is repre&s;ented as de&s;irous to take down
in writing from the mouth of O&s;cian,
who is the principal per&s;onage in &s;everal
of the following fragments, his warlike
atchievements and tho&s;e of his family.
But O&s;cian treats the monk and his reli|gion
with di&s;dain, telling him, that the
deeds of &s;uch great men were &s;ubjects too
<PB N="v" REF="4">
high to be recorded by him, or by any
of his religion: A full proof that
Chri&s;tianity was not as yet e&s;tabli&s;hed
in the country.</P>
<P>Though the poems now publi&s;hed
appear as detached pieces in this col|lection,
there is ground to believe that
mo&s;t of them were originally epi&s;odes
of a greater work which related to the
wars of Fingal. Concerning this hero
innumerable traditions remain, to this
day, in the Highlands of Scotland. The
&s;tory of O&s;cian, his &s;on, is &s;o generally
known, that to de&s;cribe one in whom
the race of a great family ends, it has
pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb; <Q REND="inline">"O&s;cian the la&s;t
of the heroes."</Q></P>
<P>There can be no doubt that the&s;e
poems are to be a&s;cribed to the Bards;
a race of men well known to have conti|nued
throughout many ages in Ireland
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
and the north of Scotland. Every chief
or great man had in his family a Bard or
poet, who&s;e office it was to record in
ver&s;e, the illu&s;trious actions of that fa|mily.
By the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Bards,
&s;uch poems were handed down from race
to race; &s;ome in manu&s;cript, but more
by oral tradition. And tradition, in a
country &s;o free of intermixture with fo|reigners,
and among a people &s;o &s;trong|ly
attached to the memory of their an|ce&s;tors,
has pre&s;erved many of them in
a great mea&s;ure incorrupted to this day.</P>
<P>They are not &s;et to mu&s;ic, nor &s;ung.
The ver&s;ification in the original is
&s;imple; and to &s;uch as under&s;tand the
language, very &s;mooth and beautiful.
Rhyme is &s;eldom u&s;ed: but the cadence,
and the length of the line varied, &s;o as to
&s;uit the &s;en&s;e. The tran&s;lation is ex|tremely
literal. Even the arrangement
of the words in the original has been
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
imitated; to which mu&s;t be imputed
&s;ome inver&s;ions in the &s;tyle, that other|wi&s;e
would not have been cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Of the poetical merit of the&s;e frag|ments
nothing &s;hall here be &s;aid. Let
the public judge, and pronounce. It
is believed, that, by a careful inquiry,
many more remains of ancient genius,
no le&s;s valuable than tho&s;e now given
to the world, might be found in the
&s;ame country where the&s;e have been
collected. In particular there is rea&s;on
to hope that one work of con&s;iderable
length, and which de&s;erves to be &s;tyled
an heroic poem, might be recovered and
tran&s;lated, if encouragement were given
to &s;uch an undertaking. The &s;ub|ject
is, an inva&s;ion of Ireland by
Swarthan King of Lochlyn; which is
the name of Denmark in the Er&s;e lan|guage.
Cuchulaid, the General or Chief
of the Iri&s;h tribes, upon intelligence of the
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
inva&s;ion, a&s;&s;embles his forces. Councils
are held; and battles fought. But af|ter
&s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful engagements,
the Iri&s;h are forced to &s;ubmit. At
length, Fingal King of Scotland, called
in this poem, "The De&s;ert of the hills,"
arrives with his &s;hips to a&s;&s;i&s;t Cuchu|laid.
He expels the Danes from the
country; and returns home victorious.
This poem is held to be of greater anti|quity
than any of the re&s;t that are pre|&s;erved:
And the author &s;peaks of him|&s;elf
as pre&s;ent in the expedition of Fin|gal.
The three la&s;t poems in the collec|tion
are fragments which the tran&s;lator
obtained of this epic poem; and though
very imperfect, they were judged not
unworthy of being in&s;erted. If the
whole were recovered, it might &s;erve to
throw con&s;iderable light upon the Scot|ti&s;h
and Iri&s;h antiquities.</P>

<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY love is a &s;on of the hill.
He pur&s;ues the flying deer.
His grey dogs are panting
around him; his bow-&s;tring &s;ounds in
the wind. Whether by the fount of
the rock, or by the &s;tream of the
mountain thou lie&s;t; when the ru&s;hes are
nodding with the wind, and the mi&s;t
is flying over thee, let me approach
my love unperceived, and &s;ee him

<P>WHAT voice is that I hear? that

the fount of the rock. Afar, Vinvela,
afar I go to the wars of Fingal. My
dogs attend me no more. No more
I tread the hill. No more from on
high I &s;ee thee, fair-moving by the

bow of heaven; as the moon on the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEN thou art gone, O Shilric!
and I am alone on the hill. The
deer are &s;een on the brow; void of
fear they graze along. No more they
dread the wind; no more the ru&s;tling
tree. The hunter is far removed;
<PB N="11" REF="10">
he is in the field of graves. Stran|gers!

<SPEAKER>SHILRIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF fall I mu&s;t in the field, rai&s;e high

heaped-up earth, &s;hall mark me to future

the mound, and produce his food at
noon, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome warrior re&s;ts here,"</Q> he

<SP>
<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES!&mdash;I will remember thee&mdash;indeed
my Shilric will fall. What &s;hall I do,
my love! when thou art gone for ever?
Through the&s;e hills I will go at noon: I
will go through the &s;ilent heath. There

<P>I SIT by the mo&s;&s;y fountain; on the
top of the hill of winds. One tree is
ru&s;tling above me. Dark waves roll
over the heath. The lake is troubled
below. The deer de&s;cend from the
hill. No hunter at a di&s;tance is &s;een;
no whi&s;tling cow-herd is nigh. It is
mid-day: but all is &s;ilent. Sad are my
thoughts as I &s;it alone. Did&s;t thou
but appear, O my love, a wanderer on
the heath! thy hair floating on the
wind behind thee; thy bo&s;om heaving
on the &s;ight; thine eyes full of tears
for thy friends, whom the mi&s;t of the
hill had concealed! Thee I would com|fort,
my love, and bring thee to thy
father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT is it &s;he that there appears, like
a beam of light on the heath? bright
<PB N="14" REF="13">
as the moon in autumn, as the &s;un in
a &s;ummer-&s;torm?&mdash;She &s;peaks: but
how weak her voice! like the breeze
in the reeds of the pool. Hark!</P>
<P>RETURNEST thou &s;afe from the war?
Where are thy friends, my love? I
heard of thy death on the hill; I heard
and mourned thee, Shilric!</P>
<P>YES, my fair, I return; but I alone
of my race. Thou &s;halt &s;ee them no
more: their graves I rai&s;ed on the plain.
But why art thou on the de&s;ert hill?
why on the heath, alone?</P>
<P>ALONE I am, O Shilric! alone in the
winter-hou&s;e. With grief for thee I ex|pired.
Shilric, I am pale in the tomb.</P>
<P>SHE fleets, &s;he &s;ails away; as grey
mi&s;t before the wind!&mdash;and, wilt thou
<PB N="15" REF="14">
not &s;tay, my love? Stay and behold
my tears? fair thou appeare&s;t, my love!
fair thou wa&s;t, when alive!</P>
<P>By the mo&s;&s;y fountain I will &s;it; on
the top of the hill of winds. When
mid-day is &s;ilent around, conver&s;e, O
my love, with me! come on the wings
of the gale! on the bla&s;t of the moun|tain,
come! Let me hear thy voice, as

<P>EVENING is grey on the hills. The
north wind re&s;ounds through the
woods. White clouds ri&s;e on the &s;ky: the
trembling &s;now de&s;cends. The river howls
afar, along its winding cour&s;e. Sad,
by a hollow rock, the grey-hair'd Carryl
&s;at. Dry fern waves over his head; his

roaring winds he lifts his voice of woe.</P>
<P>TOSSED on the wavy ocean is He,
the hope of the i&s;les; Malcolm, the

why live we to mourn thy fate? We
might have heard, with thee, the voice
of the deep; have &s;een the oozy rock.</P>
<P>SAD on the &s;ea-beat &s;hore thy &s;pou&s;e
looketh for thy return. The time of

By the foot of &s;ome rock thou lie&s;t;
wa&s;hed by the waves as they come.
Why, ye winds, did ye bear him on
the de&s;ert rock? Why, ye waves, did

Who rides on that meteor of fire! Green

Daughter of Reynold! he is gone.
Thy &s;pou&s;e &s;hall return no more. No

<P>I will &s;it by the &s;tream of the plain.
Ye rocks! hang over my head. Hear

<P>AUTUMN is dark on the mountains;
grey mi&s;t re&s;ts on the hills. The
whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark
rolls the river through the narrow plain.
A tree &s;tands alone on the hill, and
marks the grave of Connal. The leaves
whirl round with the wind, and &s;trew
the grave of the dead. At times are
&s;een here the gho&s;ts of the decea&s;ed,
when the mu&s;ing hunter alone &s;talks
&s;lowly over the heath.</P>
<P>WHO can reach the &s;ource of thy
race, O Connal? and who recount thy
Fathers? Thy family grew like an oak
on the mountain, which meeteth the
wind with its lofty head. But now it
is torn from the earth. Who &s;hall &s;up|ply

<P><PB REF="23">
HERE was the din of arms; and
here the groans of the dying. Mourn|ful
are the wars of Fingal! O Connal!
it was here thou did&s;t fall. Thine arm
was like a &s;torm; thy &s;word, a beam
of the &s;ky; thy height, a rock on the
plain; thine eyes, a furnace of fire.
Louder than a &s;torm was thy voice,
when thou confounded&s;t the field. War|riors
fell by thy &s;word, as the thi&s;tle by

<P>DARGO the mighty came on, like a
cloud of thunder. His brows were con|tracted
and dark. His eyes like two
caves in a rock. Bright ro&s;e their

of their &s;teel.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Rinval was near;
Crimora, bright in the armour of man;
her hair loo&s;e behind, her bow in her
hand. She followed the youth to the

war, Connal her much beloved. She
drew the &s;tring on Dargo; but erring
pierced her Connal. He falls like an

Prince of men! what tears run down

<P>MEMORY, &s;on of Alpin, memory
wounds the aged. Of former times are

into my mind, and wound me with
remembrance.</P>
<P>ONE day, returned from the &s;port of
the mountains, from pur&s;uing the &s;ons
of the hill, we covered this heath with
our youth. Fingal the mighty was here,
and O&s;cur, my &s;on, great in war. Fair
on our &s;ight from the &s;ea, at once, a
virgin came. Her brea&s;t was like the
&s;now of one night. Her cheek like the
<PB REF="26">
bud of the ro&s;e. Mild was her blue
rolling eye: but &s;orrow was big in her
heart.</P>
<P>FINGAL renowned in war! &s;he cries,
&s;ons of the king, pre&s;erve me! Speak &s;e|cure,
replies the king, daughter of beau|ty,
&s;peak: our ear is open to all: our
&s;words redre&s;s the injured. I fly from
Ullin, &s;he cries, from Ullin famous in
war. I fly from the embrace of him
who would deba&s;e my blood. Cremor,
the friend of men, was my father; Cre|mor
the Prince of Inverne.</P>
<P>FINGAL's younger &s;ons aro&s;e; Carryl
expert in the bow; Fillan beloved of

<P>FAR in the blue di&s;tance of the deep,
&s;ome &s;pot appeared like the back of the
ridge-wave. But &s;oon the &s;hip increa&s;ed
on our &s;ight. The hand of Ullin drew
her to land. The mountains trembled
as he moved. The hills &s;hook at his

him. Death and de&s;truction were in his
eyes. His &s;tature like the roe of Mor|ven.
He moved in the lightning of
&s;teel.</P>
<P>OUR warriours fell before him,
like the field before the reapers. Fin|gal's
three &s;ons he bound. He plun|ged
his &s;word into the fair-one's brea&s;t.
She fell as a wreath of &s;now before the

death; her &s;oul came forth in blood.</P>
<P><PB REF="28">
OSCUR my &s;on came down; the

But death was di&s;tant far, and delayed
to come. The &s;un began to decline;
and the cow-herd thought of home.
Then O&s;cur's keen &s;teel found the heart

earth from my hand. The king of the
De&s;ert of hills alone can fight with
Garve. Once we wre&s;tled on the hill.
Our heels overturned the wood. Rocks
fell from their place, and rivulets chan|ged
their cour&s;e. Three days we &s;trove
together; heroes &s;tood at a di&s;tance,

<P>No. I will never yield to man.
Cuchulaid will conquer or die. Go,
