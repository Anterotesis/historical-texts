<HEAD>THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;choolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their Saints or authors. E&s;cobar, for in&s;tance, was &s;aid to have learning as five, genius as four, and gravity as &s;even. Caramuel was greater than he. His learning was as eight, his genius as &s;ix, and his gravity as thirteen. Were I to e&s;timate the merits of our Chine&s;e Philo&s;opher by the &s;ame &s;cale, I would not he&s;itate to &s;tate his genius &s;till higher; but as to his learning and gravity, the&s;e I think might &s;afely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine, within one degree of ab&s;olute frigidity.</P>
<P>Yet upon his fir&s;t appearance here, many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a Tripoline amba&s;&s;ador, or an Envoy from Mujac. They were &s;urprized to find a man born &s;o far from London, that &s;chool of pru|dence and wi&s;dom, endued even with a moderate ca|pacity. They expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;urprize at hisknow|ledge that the Chine&s;e do at ours. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Comte, Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 210.</NOTE><HI>How comes it,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>that the Europeans, &s;o remote from China, think with &s;o much ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion? They have never read our books, they &s;carcely know even our let|ters, and yet they talk and rea&s;on ju&s;t as we do.</HI> The truth is, the Chine&s;e and we are pretty much alike. Different degrees of re&s;inement, and not of di&s;tance,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
mark the di&s;tinctions among mankind. Savages of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite climates, have all but one character of improvidence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">apacity; and tutored nations, how|ever &s;eparate, make u&s;e of the very &s;ame methods to procure refined enjoyment.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctions of polite nations are few; but &s;uch as are peculiar to the Chine&s;e, appear in every page of the following corre&s;pondence. The metaphors and allu&s;ions are all drawn from the Ea&s;t. Their formality our author carefully pre&s;erves. Many of their favou|rite tenets in morals are illu&s;trated. The Chine&s;e are always conci&s;e, &s;o is he. Simple, &s;o is he. The Chi|ne&s;e are grave and &s;ententious, &s;o is he. But in one particular, the re&s;emblance is peculiarly &s;triking: the Chine&s;e are often dull; and &s;o is he. Nor has my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance been wanting. We are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his hor&s;e who contracted an intimate friend&s;hip. The hor&s;e mo&s;t u&s;ually bore the knight, but, in ca&s;es of extraordinary di&s;patch, the knight returned the favour, and carried his hor&s;e. Thus in the intimacy between my author and me, he has u&s;ually given me a lift of his Ea&s;tern &s;ublimity, and I have &s;ometimes given him a return of my colloquial ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet it appears &s;trange in this &s;ea&s;on of panegyric, when &s;carce an author pa&s;&s;es unprai&s;ed either by his friends or him&s;elf, that &s;uch merit as our Philo&s;opher's &s;hould be forgotten. While the epithets of ingenious, copious, elaborate, and refined, are lavi&s;hed among the mob, like medals at a coronation, the lucky prizes fall on every &s;ide, but not one on him. I could on this occa&s;ion make my&s;elf melancholy, by con&s;idering the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of public ta&s;te, or the mutability of
<PB N="v" REF="4">
fortune; but during this fit of morality, le&s;t my reader &s;hould &s;leep, I'll take a nap my&s;elf, and when I awake tell him my dream.</P>
<P>I imagined the Thames was frozen over, and I &s;tood by its &s;ide. Several booths were erected upon the ice, and I was told by one of the &s;pectators, that FASHION FAIR was going to begin. He added, that every au|thor who would carry his works there, might probably find a very good reception. I was re&s;olved, however, to ob&s;erve the humours of the place in &s;afety from the &s;hore, &s;en&s;ible that ice was at be&s;t precarious, and having been always a little cowardly in my &s;leep.</P>
<P>Several of my acquaintance &s;eemed much more hardy than I, and went over the ice with intrepidity. Some carried their works to the fair on &s;ledges, &s;ome on carts, and tho&s;e which were more voluminous, were convey|ed in waggons. Their temerity a&s;toni&s;hed me. I knew their cargoes were heavy, and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom. They all entered the fair, however, in &s;afety, and each &s;oon after returned to my great &s;urprize, highly &s;atisfied with his entertainment, and the bargains he had brought away.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch numbers at la&s;t began to ope|rate upon me. If the&s;e, cried I, meet with favour and &s;afety, &s;ome luck may, perhaps, for once attend the unfortunate. I am re&s;olved to make a new adven|ture. The furniture, frippery and fire-works of Chi|na, have long been fa&s;hionably bought up. I'll try the fair with a &s;mall cargoe of Chine&s;e morality. If the Chine&s;e have contributed to vitiate our ta&s;te, I'll try how far they can help to improve our under&s;tanding.
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
But as others have driven into the market in waggons, I'll cautiou&s;ly begin by venturing with a wheel-barrow. Thus re&s;olved, I baled up my goods and fairly ventur|ed; when, upon ju&s;t entering the fair, I fancied the ice that had &s;upported an hundred waggons before, cracked under me; and wheel-barrow and all went to the bottom.</P>
<P>Upon awaking from my reverie, with the fright, I cannot help wi&s;hing that the pains taken in giving this corre&s;pondence an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, had been employed in contriving new political &s;y&s;tems, or new plots for far|ces. I might then have taken my &s;tation in the world, either as a poet or a philo&s;opher; and made one in tho&s;e little &s;ocieties where men club to rai&s;e each others repu|tation. But at pre&s;ent I belong to no particular cla&s;s. I remember one of tho&s;e &s;olitary animals, that has been forced from its fore&s;t to gratify human curio&s;ity. My earlie&s;t wi&s;h was to e&s;cape unheeded through life; but I have been &s;et up for half-pence, to fret and &s;camper at the end of my chain. Tho' none are injured by my rage, I am naturally too &s;avage to court any friends by fawning. Too ob&s;tinate to be taught new tricks; and too improvident to mind what may happen, I am appea&s;ed, though not contented. Too indolent for iatrigue, and too timid to pu&s;h favour, I am&mdash;But what &s;ignifies what I am.</P>

<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>Friend of my heart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>MAY the wings of peace re&s;t upon thy dwelling, and the &s;hield of con&s;cience pre&s;erve thee from vice and mi&s;ery:</HI> for all thy favours accept my grati|tude and e&s;teem, the only tributes a poor philo&s;ophic wanderer can return; &s;ure fortune is re&s;olved to make me unhappy, when &s;he gives others a power of te&s;tify|ing their friend&s;hip by actions, and leaves me only words to expre&s;s the &s;incerity of mine.</P>
<P>I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the delicacy by which you endeavour to le&s;&s;en your own merit and my obligations. By calling your late in&s;tances of friend&s;hip only a return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> former favours, you would induce me to impute to your ju&s;tice what I owe to your genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The &s;ervices I did you at Canton, ju&s;tice, huma|nity, and my office bade me perform; tho&s;e you have done me &s;ince my arrival at Am&s;terdam, no laws obli|ged you to, no ju&s;tice required, even half your favours would have been greater than my mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations.</P>
<P>The &s;um of money therefore which you privately conveyed into my baggage, when I was leaving Hol|land,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and which I was ignorant of till my arrival in London, I mu&s;t beg leave to return. You have been bred a merchant, and l a &s;cholar; You con&s;equently love money better than I. You can find plea&s;ure in &s;uperfluity, I am perfectly contented with what is &s;uf|ficient; take therefore what is yours, it may give you &s;ome plea&s;ure, even though you have no occa&s;ion to u&s;e it; my happine&s;s it cannot improve, for I have already all that I want.</P>
<P>My pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea from Rotterdam to England, was more painful to me than all the journies I ever made on land. I have traver&s;ed the immea&s;urable wilds of Mo|gul Tartary; felt all the rigours of Siberian &s;kies; I have had my repo&s;e an hundred times di&s;turbed by in|vading &s;avages, and have &s;een without &s;hrinking the de&s;art &s;ands ri&s;e like a troubled ocean all around me; again&s;t the&s;e calamities I was armed with re&s;olution; but in my pa&s;&s;age to England, though nothing occurred that gave the mariners any unea&s;ine&s;s, yet to one who was never at &s;ea before, all was a &s;ubject of a&s;toni&s;h|ment and terror. To find the land di&s;appear, to &s;ee our &s;hip mount the waves quick as an arrow from the Tartar bow, to hear the wind howling through the cordage, to feel a &s;ickne&s;s which depre&s;&s;es even the &s;pi|rits of the brave; the&s;e were unexpected di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and con&s;equently a&s;&s;aulted me unprepared to receive them.</P>
<P>You men of Europe think nothing of a voyage by &s;ea. With us of China, a man who has been from &s;ight of land is regarded upon his return with admira|tion. I have known &s;ome provinces where there is not even a name for the ocean. What a &s;trange people therefore am I got among&s;t, who have founded an
<PB N="10" REF="9">
empire on this un&s;table element, who build cities upon billows that ri&s;e higher than the mountains of Tiparta|la, and make the deep more formidable than the wild|e&s;t tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Such accounts as the&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, were my fir&s;t motives for &s;eeing England. The&s;e induced me to un|dertake a journey of &s;even hundred painful days, in order to examine into opulence, buildings, &s;ciences, arts and manufactures on the &s;pot. Judge then how great is my di&s;appointment on entering London, to &s;ee no &s;igns of that opulence &s;o much talked of abroad? wherever I turn, I am pre&s;ented with a gloomy &s;o|lemnity in the hou&s;es, the &s;treets and the inhabitants; none of that beautiful gilding which makes a priacipal ornament in Chine&s;e architecture. The &s;treets of Nan|kin are &s;ometimes &s;trewed with gold-leaf; very diffe|rent are tho&s;e of London: in the mid&s;t of their pave|ments, a great lazy puddle moves muddily along; heavy laden machines with wheels of unweildy thickne&s;s crowd up every pa&s;&s;age; &s;o that a &s;tranger, in&s;tead of finding time for ob&s;ervation, is often happy if he has time to e&s;cape from being cru&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es borrow very few ornaments from archi|tecture; their chief decoration &s;eems to be a paltry piece of painting, hung out at the doors or windows, at once a proof of their indigence and vanity. Their vanity, in each having one of tho&s;e pictures expo&s;ed to public view; and their indigence, in being unable to get them better painted. In this re&s;pect, the fancy of their painters is al&s;o deplorable. Could you believe it? I have &s;een five black lions and three blue boars in le&s;s than a circuit of half a mile; and yet you know that animals of the&s;e colours are no where to be found ex|cept in the wild imaginations of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
From the&s;e circum&s;tances in their buildings, and from the di&s;mal look of the inhabitants, I am induced to conclude that the nation is actually poor; and that like the Per&s;ians, they make a &s;plendid figure every where but at home. The proverb of Xixofou is, that a man's riches may be &s;een in his eyes; if we judge of the Engli&s;h by this rule, there is not a poorer nation un|der the &s;un.</P>
<P>I have been here but two day, &s;o will not be ha&s;ty in my deci&s;ions; &s;uch letters as I &s;hall write to Fip&s;ihi in Mo&s;cow, I beg you'll endeavour to forward with all diligence; I &s;hall &s;end them open, in order that you may take copies or tran&s;lations, as you are equally ver|&s;ed in the Dutch and Chine&s;e languages. Dear friend, think of my ab&s;ence with regret, as I &s;incerely regret yours; even while I write, I lament our &s;eparation.</P>
<CLOSER>Farewell.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi, to the care of Fip&s;ihi, re&s;ident in
Mo&s;cow; to be forwarded by the Ru&s;&s;ian caravan to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t
pre&s;ident of the ceremonial aca|demy at Pekin in China.</HEAD>
<P>THINK not, O thou guide of my youth, that ab&s;ence can impair my re&s;pect, or interpo&s;ing trackle&s;s de&s;arts blot your reverend figure from my me|mory. The farther I travel I feel the pain of &s;epara|tion with &s;tronger force, tho&s;e ties that bind me to my native country, and you, are &s;till unbroken. By every remove, I only drag a greater length of chain.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Could I find aught worth tran&s;mitting from &s;o re|mote a region as this to which I have wandered, I &s;hould gladly &s;end it; but in&s;tead of this, you mu&s;t be contented with a renewal of my former profe&s;&s;ions, and an imperfect account of a people with whom I am as yet but &s;uperficially acquainted. The remarks of a man who has been but three days in the country can only be tho&s;e obvious circum&s;tances which force them&s;elves upon the imagination: I con&s;ider my&s;elf here as a newly created Being introduced into a new world; every object &s;trikes with wonder and &s;urpri&s;e. The imagination &s;till un&s;ated, &s;eems the only active prin|ciple of the mind. The mo&s;t trifling occurrences give plea&s;ure, till the glo&s;s of novelty is worn away. When I have cea&s;ed to wonder, I may po&s;&s;ibly grow wi&s;e; I may then call the rea&s;oning principle to my aid, and compare tho&s;e objects with each other, which were be|fore examined without reflection.</P>
<P>Behold me then in London, gazing at the &s;trangers, and they at me; it &s;eems they find &s;omewhat ab&s;urd in my figure; and had I been never from home it is po&s;|&s;ible I might find an infinite fund of ridicule in theirs; but by long travelling I am taught to laugh at folly alone, and to find nothing truly ridiculous but villainy and vice.</P>
<P>When I had ju&s;t quitted my native country, and cro&s;&s;ed the Chine&s;e wall, I fancied every deviation from the cu&s;toms and manners of China was a departing from nature: I &s;miled at the blue lips and red foreheads of the Tongue&s;e; and could hardly contain when I &s;aw the Daures dre&s;s their heads with horns. The O&s;tiacs powdered with red earth; and the Calmuck beauties tricked out in all the finery of &s;heep-&s;kin appeared
<PB N="13" REF="12">
highly ridiculous; but I &s;oon perceived that the ridi|cule lay not in them but in me; that I fal&s;ely con|demned others of ab&s;urdity; becau&s;e they happened to differ from a &s;tandard originally founded in prejudice or partiality.</P>
<P>I find no plea&s;ure therefore in taxing the Engli&s;h with departing from nature in their external appearance, which is all I yet know of their character: it is po&s;&s;ible they only endeavour to improve her &s;imple plan, &s;ince every extravagance in dre&s;s proceeds from a de&s;ire of becoming more beautiful than nature made us: and this is &s;o harmle&s;s a vanity, that I not only pardon but approve it: A de&s;ire to be more excellent than others is what actually makes us &s;o, and as thou&s;ands find a livelihood in &s;ociety by &s;uch appetites, none but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gnorant inveigh again&s;t them.</P>
<P>You are not in&s;en&s;ible, mo&s;t reverend Fum Hoam, what numberle&s;s trades, even among the Chine&s;e, &s;ub|&s;i&s;t by the harmle&s;s pride of each other. Your no&s;e|borers, feet &s;wathers, tooth-&s;tainers, eye-brow pluckers, would all want bread, &s;hould their neighbours want vanity. The&s;e vanities, however, employ much fewer hands in China than in England; and a fine gentleman, or a fine lady here, dre&s;&s;ed up in the fa&s;hion, &s;eems &s;carcely to have a &s;ingle limb that does not &s;uffer &s;ome di&s;tortions from art.</P>
<P>To make a fine gentleman, &s;everal trades are re|quired, but chiefly a barber: you have undoubtedly heard of the Jewi&s;h champion who&s;e &s;trength lay in his hair: one would think that the Engli&s;h were for placing all wi&s;dom there: To appear wi&s;e, nothing
<PB N="14" REF="13">
more is requi&s;ite here than for a man to borrow hair from the heads of all his neighbours, and clap it like a bu&s;h on his own: the di&s;tributors of law and phy&s;ic &s;tick on &s;uch quantities, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, even in idea, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the head and the hair.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e whom I have now been de&s;cribing, affect the gravity of the lion: tho&s;e I am going to de&s;cribe more re&s;emble the pert vivacity of &s;maller animals. The barber, who is &s;till ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, cuts their hair clo&s;e to the crown; and then with a compo&s;ition of meal and hog's lard, pla&s;ters the whole in &s;uch a man|ner, as to make it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h whether the patient wears a cap or a plai&s;ter; but to make the picture more perfectly &s;triking, conceive the tail of &s;ome bea&s;t, a greyhound's tail, or a pig's tail for in&s;tance, appended to the back of the head, and reaching down to that place where tails in other animals are generally &s;een to begin; thus betailed and bepowdered, the man of ta&s;te fancies he improves in beauty, dre&s;&s;es up his hard-featured face in &s;miles, and attempts to look hi|deou&s;ly tender. Thus equipped, he is qualified to make love, and hopes for &s;ucce&s;s more from the powder on the out&s;ide of his head, than the &s;entiments within.</P>
<P>Yet when I con&s;ider what &s;ort of a creature the fine lady is, to whom he is &s;uppo&s;ed to pay his addre&s;&s;es, it is not &s;trange to find him thus equipped in order to plea&s;e. She is her&s;elf every whit as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of powder, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ils, and hog's lard as he: to &s;peak my &s;ecret &s;en|timents, mo&s;t reverend Fum, the ladies here are hor|ridly ugly; I can hardly endure the &s;ight of them; they no way re&s;emble the beauties of China: the Eu|ropeans have a quite different idea of beauty from us;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
when I reflect on the &s;mall footed perfections of an Ea&s;tern beauty, how is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould have eye for a woman who&s;e feet are ten inches long. I &s;hall never forget the beauties of my native city of Nangfew. How very broad their faces; how very &s;hort their no|&s;es; how very little their eyes; how very thin their lips; how very black their teeth; the &s;now on the tops of Bao is not fairer than their cheeks; and their eye-brows are &s;mall as the line by the pencil of Quam&s;i. Here a lady with &s;uch perfections would be fright|ful; Dutch and Chine&s;e beauties indeed have &s;ome re|&s;emblance, but Engli&s;h women are entirely different; red cheeks, big eyes, and teeth of a mo&s;t odious white|ne&s;s, are not only &s;een here, but wi&s;hed for; and then they have &s;uch ma&s;culine feet, as actually &s;erve <HI>&s;ome</HI> for walking!</P>
<P>Yet uncivil as nature has been, they &s;eem re&s;olved to outdo her in unkindne&s;s; they u&s;e white powder, blue powder, and black powder for their hair, and a red powder for the face on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>They like to have the face of various colours, as among the Tartars of Koreki, frequently &s;ticking on, with &s;pittle, little black patches on every part of it, except on the tip of the no&s;e, which I have never &s;een with a patch. You'll have a better idea of their man|ner of placing the&s;e &s;pots, when I have fini&s;h'd a map of an Engli&s;h face patch'd up to the fa&s;hion, which &s;hall &s;hortly be &s;ent to encrea&s;e your curious collection of paintings, medals, and mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>But what &s;urprizes more than all the re&s;t, is, what I have ju&s;t now been credibly informed by one of this country; "Mo&s;t ladies here, &s;ays he, have two faces;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
one face to &s;leep in, and another to &s;hew in company: the fir&s;t is generally re&s;erved for the hu&s;band and family at home, the other put on to plea&s;e &s;trangers abroad; the family face is often indifferent enough, but the out-door one looks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">omething better; this is always made at the toilet, where the looking-gla&s;s, and toad-eater &s;it in council and &s;ettle the complexion of the day.</P>
<P>I can't a&s;certain the truth of this remark; however, it is actually certain, that they wear more cloaths within doors than without; and I have &s;een a lady who &s;eem'd to &s;hudder at a breeze in her own appartment, appear half naked in the &s;treets.</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h &s;eem as &s;ilent as the Japone&s;e, yet vainer than the inhabitants of Siam. Upon my arrival I attributed that re&s;erve to mode&s;ty, which I now find has its origin in pride. Conde&s;cend to addre&s;s them fir&s;t, and you are &s;ure of their acquaintance; &s;toop to flattery, and you conciliate their friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. They bear hunger, cold, fatigue, and all the mi&s;eries of life without &s;hrinking; danger only calls forth their fortitude; they even exult in calamity; but contempt is what they cannot bear. An Engli&s;hman fears contempt more than death; he often flies to death as a refuge from its pre&s;&s;ure; and dies when he fancies the world has cea&s;ed to e&s;teem him.</P>
<P>Pride &s;eems the &s;ource not only of their national vi|ces,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
but of their national virtues al&s;o. An Engli&s;hman is taught to love his king as his friend, but to acknowledge no other ma&s;ter than the laws which him&s;elf has contri|buted to enact. He de&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e nations, who, that one may be free, are all content to be &s;laves; who, fir&s;t lift a tyrant into terror, and then &s;hrink under his pow|er as if delegated from heaven. Liberty is ecchoed in all their a&s;&s;emblies, and thou&s;ands might be found rea|dy to offer up their lives for the &s;ound, though per|haps not one of all the number under&s;tands its meaning. The lowe&s;t mechanic however looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his country's free|dom, and often u&s;es a language that might &s;eem haugh|ty, even in the mouth of the great emperor who traces his ance&s;try to the moon.</P>
<P>A few days ago, pa&s;&s;ing by one of their pri&s;ons, I could not avoid &s;topping, in order to li&s;ten to a dialogue which I thought might afford me &s;ome entertainment. The conver&s;ation was carried on between a debtor through the grate of his pri&s;on, a porter, who had &s;topped to re&s;t his burthen, and a &s;oldier at the win|dow. The &s;ubject was upon a threatened inva&s;ion from France, and each &s;eemed extremely anxious to re&s;cue his country from the impending danger. "<HI>For my part,</HI> cries the pri&s;oner, <HI>the greate&s;t of my appre|hen&s;ions is for our freedom; if the French &s;hould con|quer, what would become of Engli&s;h liberty. My dear Friends, liberty is the Engli&s;hman's prerogative; we mu&s;t pre&s;erve that at the expence of our lives, of that the French &s;hall never deprive us; it is not to be ex|pected that men who are &s;laves them&s;elves, would pre|&s;erve our freedom &s;hould they happen to conquer.</HI> Ay, &s;laves, cries the porter, they are all &s;laves, fit only to carry burthens every one of them. Before I would
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;toop to &s;lavery, may this be my poi&s;on (and he held the goblet in his hand) may this be my poi&s;on&mdash;but I would &s;ooner li&s;t for a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier taking the goblet from his friend, with much awe &s;ervently cried out, <HI>It is not &s;o much our li|berties as our religion that would &s;uffer by &s;uch a change. Ay our religion, my lads. May the Devil &s;ink me into flames,</HI> (&s;uch was the &s;olemnity of his adjuration) <HI>if the French &s;hould come over, but our religion would be utterly undone.</HI> So &s;aying, in&s;tead of a libation, he applied the goblet to his lips, and con|firmed his &s;entiments with a ceremony of the mo&s;t per|&s;evering devotion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every man here pretends to be a politi|cian; even the fair &s;ex are &s;ometimes found to mix the &s;everity of national altercation, with the blandi&s;h|ments of love, and often become conquerors by more weapons of de&s;truction than their eyes.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion for politicks is gratified by Dai|ly Gazettes, as with us at China. But as in ours, the emperor endeavours to in&s;truct his people, in theirs the people endeavour to in&s;truct the admini&s;tration. You, mu&s;t not, however, imagine, that they who compile the&s;e papers have any actual knowledge of the politics, or the government of a &s;tate; they only col|lect their materials from the oracle of &s;ome coffee|hou&s;e, which oracle has him&s;elf gathered them the night before from a beau at a gaming table, who has pillaged his knowledge from a great man's porter, who has had his information from the great man's gentleman, who has invented the whole &s;tory for his own amu&s;e|ment the night preceding.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
The Engli&s;h in general &s;eem fonder of gaining the e&s;teem than the love of tho&s;e they conver&s;e with: this gives a formality to their amu&s;ements; their gaye&s;t conver&s;ations have &s;omething too wi&s;e for innocent re|laxation; though in company you are &s;eldom di&s;gu&s;ted with the ab&s;urdity of a fool; you are &s;eldom lifted in|to rapture by tho&s;e &s;trokes of vivacity which give in|&s;tant, though not permanent plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What they want, however, in gaiety, they make up in politene&s;s. You &s;mile at hearing me prai&s;e the Engli&s;h for their politene&s;s; you who have heard very different accounts from the mi&s;&s;ionaries at Pekin, who have &s;een &s;uch a different behaviour in their merchants and &s;eamen at home. But I mu&s;t &s;till repeat it, the Engli&s;h &s;eem more polite than any of their neighbours: their great art in this re&s;pect lies in endeavouring, while they oblige, to le&s;&s;en the force of the favour. Other countries are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of obliging a &s;tranger; but &s;eem de&s;irous that he &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of the obliga|tion. The Engli&s;h confer their kindne&s;s with an ap|pearance of indifference, and give away benefits with an air as if they de&s;pi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Walking a few days ago between an Engli&s;h and a Frenchman into the &s;uburbs of the city, we were overtaken by a heavy &s;hower of rain. I was unpre|pared; but they had each large coats, which defended them from what &s;eemed to me a perfect inundation. The Engli&s;hman &s;eeing me &s;hrink from the weather, acco&s;ted me thus: "<HI>P&s;ha, man, what do&s;t &s;hrink at? here, take this coat; I don't want it; I find it no way u&s;eful to me; I had as lief be without it.</HI>" The Frenchman began to &s;hew his politene&s;s in turn. "<HI>My dear friend,</HI>" cries he, "<HI>why wen't you oblige me by</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<HI>making u&s;e of my coat; you &s;ee how well it defends me from the rain; I &s;hould not chu&s;e to part with it to others, but to &s;uch a friend as you, I could even part with my &s;kin to do him &s;ervice.</HI>"</P>
<P>From &s;uch minute in&s;tances as the&s;e, mo&s;t reverend Fum Hoam, I am &s;en&s;ible your &s;agacity will collect in|&s;truction. The volume of nature is the book of know|ledge; and he becomes mo&s;t wi&s;e who makes the mo&s;t judicious &s;election.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already informed you of the &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ion of this nation for politicks. An Engli&s;hman not &s;atisfied with finding by his own pro&s;perity the con|tending powers of Europe properly balanced, de&s;ires al&s;o to know the preci&s;e value of every weight in either &s;cale. To gratify this curio&s;ity, a leaf of political in|&s;truction is &s;erved up every morning with tea: When our politician has fea&s;ted upon this, he repairs to a coffee-hou&s;e, in order to ruminate upon what he has read, and encrea&s;e his collection; from thence he pro|ceeds to the ordinary, enquires what news, and trea|&s;uring up every acqui&s;ition there, hunts about all the evening in que&s;t of more, and carefully adds it to the re&s;t. Thus at night he retires home, full of the im|portant advices of the day. When lo! awaking next morning, he finds the in&s;tructions of ye&s;terday a col|lection of ab&s;urdity or palpable fal&s;ehood, This, one would think, a mortifying repul&s;e in the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom; yet our politician no way di&s;couraged, hunts
<PB N="21" REF="20">
on, in order to collect fre&s;h materials, and in order to be again di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>I have often admired the commercial &s;pirit which prevails over Europe; have been &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them carry on a traffic with productions, that an A&s;iatic &s;tranger would deem entirely u&s;ele&s;s. It is a proverb in China, that an European &s;uffers not even his &s;pittle to be lo&s;t; the maxim, however is not &s;ufficiently &s;trong; &s;ince they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ell even their Lies to great advantage. E|very nation drives a con&s;iderable trade in this commo|dity with their neighbours.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h dealer in this way, for in&s;tance, has only to a&s;cend to his workhou&s;e, and manufacture a tur|bulent &s;peech averred to be &s;poken in the &s;enate; or a report &s;uppo&s;ed to be dropt at court; a piece of &s;candal that &s;trikes at a popular Mandarine; or a &s;ecret treaty between two neighbouring powers. When fini&s;hed, the&s;e goods are baled up, and con&s;igned to a factor abroad, who &s;ends in return two battles, three &s;ieges, and a &s;hrewd letter filled with da&s;hes &mdash; blanks <GAP DESC="blank"> and &s;tars **** of great importance.</P>
<P>Thus you perceive, that a &s;ingle gazette is the joint manufacture of Europe; and he who would peru&s;e it with a philo&s;ophical eye, might perceive in every para|graph &s;omething characteri&s;tick of the nation to which it belongs. A map does not exhibit a more di&s;tinct view of the boundaries and &s;ituation of every country, than its news does a picture of the genius, and the mo|rals of its inhabitants. The &s;uper&s;tition and erroneous delicacy of Italy, the formality of Spain, the cruelty of Portugal, the fears of Au&s;tria, the confidence of Pru&s;|&s;ia, the levity of France, the avarice of Holland, the
<PB N="22" REF="21">
pride of England, the ab&s;urdity of Ireland, and the na+tional partiality of Scotland, are all con&s;picuous in every page.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, you may find more &s;atisfaction in a real news paper, than in my de&s;cription of one; I therefore &s;end a &s;pecimen, which may &s;erve to exhibit the man|ner of their being written, and di&s;tingui&s;h the charac|ters of the various nations which are united in its com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>NAPLES. We have lately dug up here a curious Etru&s;can monument, broke in two in the rai&s;ing. The characters are &s;carce vi&s;ible; but <HI>Nugo&s;i,</HI> the learned antiquary, &s;uppo&s;es it to have been erected in honour of <HI>Picus,</HI> a Latin King, as one of the lines may be plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed to begin with a P. It is hoped this di&s;covery will produce &s;omething valuable, as the lite|rati of our twelve academies are deeply engaged in the di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>PISA. Since father Fudgi, prior of St. Gilbert's, has gone to re&s;ide at Rome, no miracles have been per|formed at the &s;hrine of St. Gilbert; the devout begin to grow unea&s;y, and &s;ome begin actually to fear that St. Gilbert has for&s;aken them with the reverend fa|ther.</P>
<P>LUCCA. The admini&s;trators of our &s;erene republic, have frequent conferences upon the part they &s;hall take in the pre&s;ent commotions of Europe. Some are for &s;ending a body of their troops, con&s;i&s;ting of one com|pany of foot, and &s;ix hor&s;emen, to make a diver&s;ion in favour of the empre&s;s-queen; others are as &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertors of the Pru&s;&s;ian intere&s;t: what turn the&s;e de|bates
<PB N="23" REF="22">
may take, time only can di&s;cover. However, certain it is, we &s;hall be able to bring into the field at the opening of the next campaign, &s;eventy-five armed men, a commander in chief, and two drummers of great experience.</P>
<P>SPAIN. Ye&s;terday the new king &s;hewed him&s;elf to his &s;ubjects, and after having &s;taid half an hour in his balcony, retired to the royal apartment. The night concluded on this extraordinary occa&s;ion with illumina|tions, and other demon&s;trations of joy.</P>
<P>The queen is more beautiful than the ri&s;ing &s;un, and reckoned one of the fir&s;t wits in Europe: &s;he had a glorious opportunity of di&s;playing the readine&s;s of her invention, and her &s;kill in repartee lately at court. The duke of Lerma, coming up to her with a low bow and a &s;mile, and pre&s;enting a no&s;egay &s;et with diamonds, <HI>Madam,</HI> cries he, <HI>I am your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;er|vant. Oh, Sir,</HI> replies the queen, without any prompter, or the lea&s;t he&s;itation, <HI>I'm very proud of the very great honour you do me.</HI> Upon which &s;he made a very low curte&s;y, and all the courtiers fell a laughing at the readine&s;s and the &s;martne&s;s of her reply.</P>
<P>LISBON. Ye&s;terday we had an <HI>auto da fe,</HI> at which were burned three young women accu&s;ed of here&s;y, one of them of exqui&s;ite beauty? two Jews, and an old woman, convicted of being a witch: One of the friars, who attended this la&s;t, reports, that he &s;aw the devil fly out of her at the &s;take in the &s;hape of a flame of fire. The populace behaved on this occa&s;ion with great good humour, joy and &s;incere devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Our <HI>merciful Sovereign</HI> has been for &s;ome time pa&s;t recovered of his fright: though &s;o attrocious an at|tempt de&s;erved to exterminate half the nation, yet he has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;pare the lives of his &s;ub|jects, and not above five hundred have been broke upon the wheel, or otherwi&s;e executed upon this hor|rid occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>VIENNA. We have received certain advices that a party of twenty thou&s;and Au&s;trians, having attacked a much &s;uperior body of Pru&s;&s;ians, put them all to flight, and took the re&s;t pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>BERLIN. We have received certain advices that a party of twenty thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians having attacked a much &s;uperior body of Au&s;trians, put them to flight, and took a great number of pri&s;oners, with their mili|tary che&s;t, cannon, and baggage.</P>
<P>Though we have not &s;ucceeded this campaign to our wi&s;hes; yet, when we think of him who commands us, we re&s;t in &s;ecurity: while we &s;leep, our king is watch|ful for our &s;afety.</P>
<P>PARIS. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;trike a &s;ignal blow. We have &s;eventeen flat-bottom'd boats at Havre. The people are in excellent &s;pirits, and our mini&s;ters make no difficulty of rai&s;ing the &s;upplies.</P>
<P>We are all undone; the people are di&s;contented to the la&s;t degree; the mini&s;ters are obliged to have re|cour&s;e to the mo&s;t rigorous methods to rai&s;e the ex|pences of the war.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
Our di&s;tre&s;&s;es are great; but madam Pompadour continues to &s;upply our king, who is now growing old, with a fre&s;h lady every night. His health, thank hea|ven, is &s;till pretty well; nor is he in the lea&s;t unfit, as was reported, for any kind of royal exercitation. He was &s;o frighted at the affair of Damien, that his phy|&s;icians were apprehen&s;ive le&s;t his rea&s;on &s;hould &s;uffer, but that wretch's tortures &s;oon compo&s;ed the kingly terrors of his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>ENGLAND. Wanted an u&s;her to an academy. <HI>N. B.</HI> He mu&s;t be able to read, dre&s;s hair, and mu&s;t have had the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>DUBLIN. We hear that there is a benevolent &s;ub|&s;cription on foot among the nobility and gentry of this kingdom, who are great patrons of merit, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t Black and All Black, in his conte&s;t with the Pad|dereen mare.</P>
<P>We hear from Germany that Prince Ferdinand has gained a complete victory, and taken twelve kettle drums, five &s;tandards, and four waggons of ammuni|tion pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>EDINBURGH. We are po&s;itive when we &s;ay that Saunders M'Gregor who was lately executed for hor&s;e|&s;tealing, is not a Scotchman, but born in Carrickfergus.</P>

<P>How long, my friend, &s;hall an enthu&s;ia&s;m for know|ledge continue to ob&s;truct your happine&s;s, and tear you from all the connexions that make life plea&s;ing? How long will you continue to rove from climate to climate, circled by thou&s;ands, and yet without a friend, feeling all the inconveniencies of a croud, and all the anxiety of being alone.</P>
<P>I know you will reply, that the refined plea&s;ure of growing every day wi&s;er, is a &s;ufficient recompence for every inconvenience. I know you will talk of the vul|gar &s;atisfaction of &s;oliciting happine&s;s from &s;en&s;ual en|joyment only; and probably enlarge upon the exqui&s;ite raptures of &s;entimental bli&s;s.

&s;ome &s;en&s;ual &s;atisfaction, is delightful only to fools, or to men who have by long habit contracted a fal&s;e idea of plea&s;ure; and he who &s;eparates &s;en&s;ual and &s;enti|mental enjoyments, &s;eeking happine&s;s from mind alone, is in fact as wretched as the naked inhabitant of the fo|re&s;t, who places all happine&s;s in the fir&s;t, regardle&s;s of the latter.

<P>It is with an heart full of &s;orrow, my dear Altangi, that I mu&s;t inform you that what the world calls hap|pine&s;s mu&s;t now be yours no longer.

<P>I fancy my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, O thou reverend di&s;ciple of Tao, more than a match for all that can happen; the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of my life has been to procure wi&s;|dom, and the chief object of that wi&s;dom was to be happy. My attendance on your lectures, my confer|ences with the mi&s;&s;ionaries of Europe, and all my &s;ub|&s;equent adventures upon quitting China, were calcu|lated to increa&s;e the &s;phere of my happine&s;s, not my curio&s;ity.

<P>Men may be very learned, and yet very mi&s;erable; it is ea&s;y to be a deep geometrician, or a &s;ublime a&s;tro|nomer, but very difficult to be a good man; I e&s;teem, therefore, the traveller who in&s;tructs the heart, but de&s;pi&s;e him who only indulges the imagination; a man who leaves home to mend him&s;elf and others is a philo&s;opher; but he who goes from country to country, guided by the blind impul&s;e of curio&s;ity, is only a vagabond. From Zerdu&s;ht down to him of Tyanea, I honour all tho&s;e great names who endea|voured to unite the world by their travels; &s;uch men grew wi&s;er as well as better, the farther they departed from home, and &s;eemed like rivers, who&s;e &s;treams are not only encrea&s;ed, but refined, as they travel from their &s;ource.</P>
<P>For my own part, my greate&s;t glory is, that travel|ling has not more &s;teeled my con&s;titution again&s;t all the vici&s;&s;itudes of climate, and all the depre&s;&s;ions of fa|tigue, than it has my mind again&s;t the accidents of for|tune, or the acce&s;&s;es of de&s;pair.</P>

Ceremonial Acdemy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>HOW in&s;upportable! oh thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of hea|venly wi&s;dom, would be this &s;eparation, this im|mea&s;urable di&s;tance from my friends were I not able thus to delineate my heart upon paper, and to &s;end thee daily a map of my mind.</P>
<P>I am every day better reconciled to the people among whom I re&s;ide, and begin to fancy that in time I &s;hall find them more opulent, more charitable, and more ho&s;pitable than I at fir&s;t imagined. I begin to learn &s;omewhat of their manners and cu&s;toms, and to &s;ee rea&s;ons for &s;everal deviations which they make from us, from whom all other nations derive their politene&s;s as well as their original.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of ta&s;te, in &s;pite of prejudice, I now begin to thnk their women tolerable; I can now look on a langui&s;hing blue eye without di&s;gu&s;t, and pardon a &s;et of teeth, even though whiter than ivory. I now begin to fancy there is no univer&s;al &s;tandard for beauty. The truth is, the manners of the ladies in this city are &s;o very open, and &s;o va&s;tly engaging, that I am inclined to pa&s;s over the more glaring defects of their per&s;ons, &s;ince compen&s;ated by the more &s;olid, yet latent beauties of the mind; what tho' they want black teeth, or are de|prived of the allurements of feet no bigger than their thumbs, yet &s;till they have &s;ouls, my friend, &s;uch &s;ouls, &s;o free, &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, &s;o ho&s;pitable, and &s;o engaging&mdash;I have received more invitations in the &s;treets of Lon|don

<P>Every evening as I return home from my u&s;ual &s;oli|tary excur&s;ions, I am met by &s;everal of tho&s;e well di&s;|po&s;ed daughters of ho&s;pitality, at different times and in different &s;treets, richly dre&s;&s;ed, and with minds not le&s;s noble than their appearance. You know that nature has indulged me with a per&s;on by no means agreeable; yet are they too generous to object to my homely ap|pearance; they feel no repugnance at my broad face and flat no&s;e; they perceive me to be a &s;tranger, and that alone is a &s;ufficient recommendation. They even &s;eem to think it their duty to do the honours of the country by every act of complai&s;ance in their power. One takes me under the arm, and in a manner forces me along; another catches me round the neck, and de|&s;ires to partake in this office of ho&s;pitality; while a third kinder &s;till, invites me to refre&s;h my &s;pirits with wine. Wine is in England re&s;erved only for the rich, yet here even wine is given away to the &s;tranger!</P>
<P>A few nights ago, one of tho&s;e generous creatures, dre&s;&s;ed all in white, and flaunting like a meteor by my &s;ide, forcibly attended me home to my own apartment. She &s;eemed charmed with the elegance of the furniture, and the convenience of my &s;ituation. And well indeed &s;he might, for I have hired an apartment for not le&s;s than two &s;hillings of their money every week. But her civility did not re&s;t here; for at parting, being de&s;irous to know the hour, and perceiving my watch out of or|der, &s;he kindly took it to be repaired by a relation of her own, which you may imagine will &s;ave &s;ome ex|pence, and &s;he a&s;&s;ures me that it will co&s;t her nothing.

<P>I Have been deceived! &s;he whom I fancied a daugh|ter of Paradi&s;e has proved to be one of the infamous di&s;ciples of Han! I have lo&s;t a trifle, I have gained the con&s;olation of having di&s;covered a deceiver. I once more, therefore, relax into my former indifference with regard to the Engli&s;h ladies, they once more be|gin to appear di&s;agreeable in my eyes: Thus is my whole time pa&s;&s;ed in forming conclu&s;ions which the next minute's experience may probably de&s;troy; the pre&s;ent moment becomes a comment on the pa&s;t, and I improve rather in humility than wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
Their laws and religion forbid the Engli&s;h to keep more than one woman, I therefore concluded that pro|&s;titutes were bani&s;hed from &s;ociety; I was deceived; every man here keeps as many wives as he can main|tain; the laws are cemented with blood, prai&s;ed and di&s;regarded. The very Chine&s;e, who&s;e religion allows him two wives, takes not half the liberties of the Eng|li&s;h in this particular. Their laws may be compared to the books of the Sybils, they are held in great venera|tion, but &s;eldom read, or &s;eldomer under&s;tood; even tho&s;e who pretend to be their guardians di&s;pute about the meaning of many of them, and confe&s;s their igno|rance of others. The law therefore which commands them to have but one wife, is &s;trictly ob&s;erved only by tho&s;e for whom one is more than &s;ufficient, or by &s;uch as have not money to buy two. As for the re&s;t, they violate it publicly, and &s;ome glory in its violation. They &s;eem to think like the Per&s;ians, that they give evident marks of manhood by encrea&s;ing their &s;eraglio. A man|darine therefore here generally keeps four wives, a gentleman three, and a &s;tage-player two. As for the magi&s;trates, the country ju&s;tices and &s;quires, they are employed fir&s;t in debauching young virgins, and then puni&s;hing the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a picture you will be apt to conclude, that he who employs four ladies for his amu&s;ement, has four times as much con&s;titution to &s;pare as he who is contented with one; that a Mandarine is much cleverer than a gentleman, and a gentl&eacute;man than a player, and yet it is quite the rever&s;e; a Mandarine is frequently &s;upported on &s;pindle &s;hanks, appears emaciated by iuxury, and is obliged to have recour&s;e to variety, merely from the weakne&s;s, not the vigour of his con|&s;titution,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
the number of his wives being the mo&s;t equivocal &s;ymptom of his virility.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the country &s;quire, there is al&s;o another &s;et of men, who&s;e whole employment con&s;i&s;ts in corrupting beauty: the&s;e the &s;illy part of the fair &s;ex call ami|able; the more &s;en&s;ible part of them, however, give them the title of abominable. You will probably de|mand what are the talents of a man thus care&s;&s;ed by the majority of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex; what talents or what beauty is he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior to the re&s;t of his fel|lows. To an&s;wer you directly, he has neither talents nor beauty, but then he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of impudence and a&s;&s;iduity. With a&s;&s;iduity and impudence, men of all ages, and all figures, may commence admirers. I have even been told of &s;ome who made profe&s;&s;ions of ex|piring for love, when all the world could perceive they were going to die of old age: and what is more &s;ur|prizing &s;till, &s;uch batter'd beaus are generally mo&s;t in|famou&s;ly &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>A fellow of this kind employs three hours every morning in dre&s;&s;ing his head, by which is under&s;tood only his hair.</P>
<P>He is a profe&s;&s;ed admirer, not of any particular lady, but of the whole &s;ex.</P>
<P>He is to &s;uppo&s;e every lady has caught cold every night, which gives him an opportunity of calling to &s;ee how &s;he does the next morning.</P>
<P>He is upon all occa&s;ions to &s;hew him&s;elf in very great pain for the ladies; if a lady drops even a pin, he is to fly in order to pre&s;ent it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
He never &s;peaks to a lady without advancing his mouth to her ear, by which he frequently addre&s;&s;es more &s;en&s;es than one.</P>
<P>Upon proper occa&s;ions he looks exce&s;&s;ively tender. This is performed by laying his hand upon his heart, &s;hutting his eyes, and &s;howing his teeth.</P>
<P>He is exce&s;&s;ively fond of dancing a minuet with the ladies, by which is only meant walking round the floor eight or ten times with his hat on, affecting great gravity, and &s;ometimes looking tenderly on his partner.</P>
<P>He never affronts any man him&s;elf, and never re|&s;ents an affront from another.</P>
<P>He has an infinite variety of &s;mall talk upon all occa&s;ions, and laughs when he has nothing more to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Such is the killing creature who pro&s;trates him&s;elf to the &s;ex till he has undone them; all who&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions are the effects of de&s;ign, and who to plea&s;e the ladies almo&s;t becomes him&s;elf a lady.</P>

<P>I HAVE hitherto given you no account of my journey from China to Europe, of my travels through countries, where nature &s;ports in primeval <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">udene&s;s, where &s;he pours forth her wonders in &s;oli|tude;
<PB N="37" REF="36">
countries, from whence the rigorous climate the &s;weeping inundation, the drifted de&s;art, the howl|ing fore&s;t, and mountains of immea&s;ureable height ba|ni&s;h the hu&s;bandman, and &s;pread exten&s;ive de&s;olation; countries where the brown Tartar wanders for a pre|carious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, with an heart that never felt pity, him&s;elf more hideous than the wilderne&s;s he makes.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily conceive the fatigue of cro&s;&s;ing va&s;t tracts of land, either de&s;olate, or &s;till more dangerous by its inhabitants. The retreat of men, who &s;eem driven from &s;ociety, in order to make war upon all the human race; nominally profe&s;&s;ing a &s;ubjection to Mo&s;|covy or China, but without any re&s;emblance to the countries on which they depend.</P>
<P>After I had cro&s;&s;ed the great wail, the fir&s;t objects that pre&s;ented were the remains of de&s;olated cities, and all the magnificence of venerable ruin. There were to be &s;een temples of beautiful &s;tructure, &s;tatues wrought by the hand of a ma&s;ter, and around a coun|try of luxuriant plenty; but not one &s;ingle inhabitant to reap the bounties of nature. The&s;e were pro&s;pects that might humble the Pride of kings, and repre&s;s hu|man vanity. I a&s;ked my guide the cau&s;e of &s;uch de&s;o|lation. The&s;e countries, &s;ays he, were once the do|minions of a Tartar prince; and the&s;e ruins the &s;eat of arts, elegance, and ea&s;e. This prince waged an un&s;ucce&s;sful war with one of the emperors of China; he was conquered, his cities plundered, and all his &s;ub|jects carried into captivity. Such are the effects of the ambition of Kings! Ten Dervi&s;es, &s;ay the Indian pro|verb, &s;hall &s;leep in peace upon a &s;ingle carpet, while two kings &s;hall quarrel though they have kingdoms to
<PB N="38" REF="37">
divide them. Sure, my friend, the cruelty and the pride of man have made more de&s;arts than nature ever made! &s;he is kind, but man is ungrateful!</P>
<P>Proceeding in my journey through this pen&s;ive &s;cene of de&s;olated beauty, in a few days I arrived among the Daures, a nation &s;till dependant on China. Xaixigar is their principal city, which, compared with tho&s;e of Europe, &s;carely de&s;erves the name. The governors and other officers, who are &s;ent yearly from Pekin, abu&s;e their authority, and often take the wives and daughters of the Inhabitants to them&s;elves. The Daures accu&s;tomed to ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, feel no re&s;entment at tho&s;e injuries, or &s;tifle what they feel. Cu&s;tom and nece&s;&s;ity teach even barbarians the &s;ame art of di&s;&s;imu|lation that ambition and intrigue in&s;pire in the brea&s;ts of the polite. Upon beholding &s;uch unlicen&s;ed &s;tretches of power, alas, thought I, how little does our wi&s;e and good emperor know of tho&s;e intolerable exactions! the&s;e provinces are too di&s;tant for complaint, and too in&s;ignificant to expect redre&s;s. The more di&s;tant the government, the hone&s;ter &s;hould be the governor to whom it is entru&s;ted; for hope of impunity is a &s;trong inducement to violation.</P>
<P>The religion of the Daures is more ab&s;urd than even that of the &s;ectaries of Fohi. How would you be &s;urprized, O &s;age di&s;ciple and follower of Confu|cius! you who believe one eternal intelligent cau&s;e of all, &s;hould you be pre&s;ent at the barbarous ceremonies of this infatuated people. How would you deplore the blindne&s;s and folly of mankind. His boa&s;ted rea|&s;on &s;eems only to light him a&s;tray, and brutal in&s;tinct more regularly points out the path to happine&s;s. Could you think it? they adore a wicked divinity; they fear
<PB N="39" REF="38">
him and they wor&s;hip him; they imagine him a ma|licious being, ready to injure and ready to be appea&s;ed. The men and women a&s;&s;emble at midnight in a hut, which &s;erves for a temple. A prie&s;t &s;tretches him&s;elf on the ground, and all the people pour forth the mo&s;t horrid cries, while drums and timbrels &s;well the infer|nal concert. After this di&s;&s;onance, mi&s;called mu&s;ic, has continued about two hours, the prie&s;t ri&s;es from the ground, a&s;&s;umes an air of in&s;piration, grows big with the in&s;piring daemon, and pretends to a &s;kill in futurity.</P>
<P>In every country, my friend, the bonzes, the drachmans, and the prie&s;ts deceive the people; all re|formations begin from the laity; the prie&s;ts point us out the way to heaven with their fingers, but &s;tand &s;till them&s;elves, nor &s;eem to travel towards the country in view.</P>
<P>The cu&s;toms of this people corre&s;pond to their re|ligion; they keep their dead for three days on the &s;ame bed where the per&s;on died; after which they bury him in a grave moderately deep, but with the head &s;till uncovered. Here for &s;everal days they pre&s;ent him different &s;orts of meats; which, when they per|ceive he does not con&s;ume, they fill up the grave, and de&s;i&s;t from de&s;iring him to eat for the future. How, how can mankind be guilty of &s;uch &s;trange ab&s;urdity, to entreat a dead body already putrid to partake of the banquet? Where, I again repeat it, is human rea&s;on; not only &s;ome men, but whole nations, &s;eem dive&s;ted of its illumination. Here we ob&s;erve a whole country adoring a divinity through fear, and attempting to feed
<PB N="40" REF="39">
the dead. The&s;e are their mo&s;t &s;erious and religious occupations: are the&s;e men rational, or are not the apes of Borneo more wi&s;e?</P>
<P>Certain I am, O thou in&s;tructor of my youth! that without philo&s;ophers, without &s;ome few virtuous men, who &s;eem to be of a different nature from the re&s;t of mankind, without &s;uch as the&s;e the wor&s;hip of a wicked divinity would &s;urely be e&s;tabli&s;hed over every part of the earth. Fear guides more to their duty than grati|tude: for one man who is virtuous from the love of virtue; from the obligation which he thinks he lies un|der to the giver of all; there are ten thou&s;and who are good only from their apprehen&s;ions of puni&s;hment. Could the&s;e la&s;t be per&s;uaded, as the Epicureans were, that heaven had no thunders in &s;tore for the villain, they would no longer continue to acknowledge &s;ubordination, or thank that being who gave them ex|i&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>FROM &s;uch a picture of nature in primeval &s;im|plicity, tell me, my much re&s;pected friend, are you in love with fatigue and &s;olitude? Do you &s;igh for the &s;evere frugality of the wandering Tartar, or regret being born amid&s;t the luxury and di&s;&s;umulation of the polite? Rather tell me, has not every kind of life vices peculiarly its own? Is it not a truth, that refined countries have more vices, but tho&s;e not &s;o terrible; barbarous nations few, and they of the mo&s;t hideous
<PB N="41" REF="40">
complexion? Perfidy and fraud are the vices of civi|lized nations, credulity and violence tho&s;e of the inha|bitants of the de&s;ert. Does the luxury of the one produce half the evils of the inhumanity of the other? Certainly tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who declaim again&s;t luxury have but little under&s;tood its benefits: they &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible, that to luxury we owe not only the greate&s;t part of our knowledge, but even of our virtues.</P>
<P>It may &s;ound fine in the mouth of a declaimer when he talks of &s;ubduing our appetites, of teaching every &s;en&s;e to be content with a bare &s;ufficiency, and of &s;up|plying only the wants of nature; but is there no more &s;atisfaction in indulging tho&s;e appetites, if with innocence and &s;afety, than in re&s;training them? Am not I better plea&s;ed in enjoyment than in the &s;ullen &s;a|tisfaction of thinking that I can live without enjoyment? The more various our artificial nece&s;&s;ities, the wider is our circle of plea&s;ure; for all plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in ob|viating nece&s;&s;ities as they ri&s;e; luxury, therefore, as it encrea&s;es our wants, encrea&s;es our capacity for hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Examine the hi&s;tory of any country remarkable for opulence and wi&s;dom, you will find they would never have been wi&s;e had they not been fir&s;t luxurious; you will find poets, philo&s;ophers, and even patriots, march|ing in luxury's train. The Rea&s;on is obvious; we then only are curious after knowledge when we find it con|nected with &s;en&s;ual happine&s;s. The &s;en&s;es ever point out the way, and reflection comments upon the di&s;co|very. Inform a native of the de&s;ert of Kobi, of the exact mea&s;ure of the parallax of the moon, he finds
<PB N="42" REF="41">
no &s;atisfaction at all in the information; he wonders how any could take &s;uch pains, and lay out &s;uch trea|&s;ures in order to &s;olve &s;o u&s;ele&s;s a difficulty; but con|nect it with his happine&s;s, by &s;hewing that it improves navigation, that by &s;uch an inve&s;tigation he may have a warmer coat, a better gun, or a finer knife, and he is in&s;tantly in raptures at &s;o great an improvement. In &s;hort, we only de&s;ire to know what we de&s;ire to po&s;|&s;e&s;s; and whatever we may talk again&s;t it, luxury adds the &s;pur to curio&s;ity, and gives us a de&s;ire of becoming more wi&s;e.</P>
<P>But not our knowledge only, but our virtues are im|proved by luxury. Ob&s;erve the brown &s;avage of Thi|bet, to whom the fruits of the &s;preading pomegranate &s;upply food, and its branches an habitation. Such a character has few vices I grant, but tho&s;e he has are of the mo&s;t hideous nature, rapine and cruelty are &s;carce crimes in his eye, neither pity nor tenderne&s;s, which enoble every virtue, have any place in his heart; he hates his enemies, and kills tho&s;e he &s;ubdues. On the other hand, the polite Chine&s;e and civilized Eu|ropean &s;eem even to love their enemies. I have ju&s;t now &s;een an in&s;tance where the Engli&s;h have &s;uccoured tho&s;e enemies whom their own countrymen have actually refu&s;ed to relieve.</P>
<P>The greater the luxuries of every country, the more clo&s;ely, politically &s;peaking, is that country united. Luxury is the child of &s;ociety alone, the luxurious man &s;tands in need of a thou&s;and different arti&s;ts to furni&s;h out his happine&s;s: it is more likely, therefore, that he &s;hould be a good citizen who is connected by motives of
<PB N="43" REF="42">
&s;elf-intere&s;t with &s;o many, than the ab&s;temious man who is united to none.</P>
<P>In what&s;oever light therefore we con&s;ider luxury, whether as employing a number of hands naturally too feeble for more laborious employment, as finding a va|riety of occupation for others who might be totally idle, or as furni&s;hing out new inlets to happine&s;s, with|out encroaching on mutual property, in whatever light we regard it, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to &s;tand up in its de|fence, and the &s;entiment of Confucius &s;till remains un|&s;haken; <HI>that we &s;hould enjoy as many of the luxuries of life as are con&s;i&s;tent with our own &s;afety; and the pro&s;|perity of others, and that be who finds out a new plea|&s;ure is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</HI></P>

The numberle&s;s ceremonies which are u&s;ed here when a per&s;on is &s;ick, appear to me &s;o many evident marks of fear and apprehen&s;ion. A&s;k an Engli&s;hman, however, whether he is afraid of death, and he boldly an&s;wers in the negative; but ob&s;erve his behaviour in circum|&s;tances of approaching &s;ickne&s;s, and you will find his actions give his a&s;&s;ertions the lie</P>

The Chine&s;e are very &s;incere in this re&s;pect; they hate to die, and they confe&s;s their terrors: a great part of their life is &s;pent in preparing things proper for their funeral; a poor artizan &s;hall &s;pend half his income in providing him&s;elf a romb twenty years before he wants it; and denies him&s;elf the nece&s;&s;aries of life, that he may be amply provided for when he &s;hall want them no more.</P>

It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, never to let a man know that he is dying: phy&s;icians are &s;ent for, the clergy are called, and every thing pa&s;&s;es in &s;ilent &s;o|lemnity round the &s;ick bed; the patient is in agonies, looks round for pity, yet not a &s;ingle creature will &s;ay that he is dying. If he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fortune, his re|lations entreat him to make his will, as it may re&s;tore the tranquillity of his mind. He is de&s;ired to undergo the rites of the church, for decency requires it. His friends take their leave only becau&s;e they don't care to &s;ee him in pain. In &s;hort, an hundred &s;tratagems are u&s;ed to make him do what he might have been induced to perform only by being told; <HI>Sir, you are pa&s;t all hopes, and had as good think decently of dying.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the chamber is darkened, the whole hou&s;e echoes to the cries of the wife, the lamenta|tions of the children, the grief of the &s;ervants, and the &s;ighs of friends. The bed is &s;urrounded with prie&s;ts and doctors in black, and only flambeaux emit a yellow gloom. Where is the man, how intrepid &s;o|ever, that would not &s;hrink at &s;uch a hideous &s;olem|nity?
<PB N="45" REF="44">
For fear of affrighting their expiring friends, the Engli&s;h practi&s;e all that can fill them with terror. Strange effect of human prejudice thus to torture mere|ly from mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s!</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my friend, what contradictions there are in the tempers of tho&s;e i&s;landers; when prompted by ambition, revenge, or di&s;&s;appointment, they meet death with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution; the very man who in his bed would have trembled at the a&s;pect of a doctor, &s;hall go with intrepidity to attack a ba&s;tion, or deli|berately noo&s;e him&s;elf up in his garters.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of the Europeans for magnificent inter|ments, is equally &s;trong with that of the Chine&s;e. When a trade&s;man dies, his frightful face is painted up by an undertaker, and placed in a proper &s;ituation to receive company; this is called lying in &s;tate. To this di&s;agreeable &s;pectacle all the idlers in town flock, and learn to loath the wretch dead, whom they de&s;pi&s;ed when living. In this manner you &s;ee &s;ome who would have refu&s;ed a &s;hilling to &s;ave the life of their deare&s;t friend, be&s;tow thou&s;ands on adorning their putrid corp&s;e. I have been told of a fellow, who grown rich by the price of blood, left it in his will that he &s;hould lie in &s;tate, and thus unknowingly gibbeted him&s;elf into infamy, when he might have otherwi&s;e quietly retired into oblivion.</P>
<P>When the per&s;on is buried, the next care is to make his epitaph; they are generally reckoned be&s;t which flatter mo&s;t; &s;uch relations therefore as have received mo&s;t benefits from the defunct, di&s;charge this friendly office; and generally flatter in proportion to their joy.
<PB N="46" REF="45">
When we read tho&s;e monumental hi&s;tories of the dead, it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that <HI>all men are equal in the du&s;t;</HI> for they all appear equally remarkable for being the mo&s;t &s;incere Chri&s;tians, the mo&s;t benevolent neigh|bours, and the hone&s;te&s;t men of their time. To go through an European cemetery, one would be apt to wonder how mankind could have &s;o ba&s;ely degenerated from &s;uch excellent ance&s;tors; every tomb pretends to claim your reverence and regret; &s;ome are prai&s;ed for piety in tho&s;e in&s;criptions who never entered the temple until they were dead; &s;ome are prai&s;ed for being ex|cellent poets, who were never mentioned, except for their dulne&s;s, when living: others for &s;ublime orators, who were never noted except for their impudence; and others &s;till for military atchievements, who were never in any other &s;kirmi&s;hes but with the watch. Some even make epitaphs for them&s;elves, and be&s;peak the readers good will. It were indeed to be wi&s;hed, that every man would early learn in this manner to make his own; that he would draw it up in terms as flattering as po&s;&s;ible; and that he would make it the employment of his whole life to de&s;erve it!</P>
<P>I have not yet been in a place called We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby, but &s;oon intend to vi&s;it it. There I am told I &s;hall &s;ee ju&s;tice done to decea&s;ed merit; none, I am told, are permitted to be buried there, but &s;uch as have adorned as well as improved mankind. There no intruders by the influence of friends or fortune, pre&s;ume to mix their unhallowed a&s;hes with philo&s;o|phers, heroes, and poets. Nothing but true merit has a place in that awful &s;anctuary: the guardian&s;hip of the tombs is continued to &s;everal reverend prie&s;ts, who are never guilty for a &s;uperior reward of taking
<PB N="47" REF="46">
down the names of good men, to make room for others of equivocal character, nor ever prophane the &s;acred walls with pageants, that po&s;terity cannot know or &s;hall blu&s;h to own.</P>
<P>I always was of opinion, that &s;epulchral honours of this kind &s;hould be con&s;idered as a national concern, and not tru&s;ted to the care of the prie&s;ts of any coun|try, how re&s;pectable &s;oever; but from the conduct of the reverend per&s;onages, who&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m I &s;hall &s;hortly be able to di&s;cover, I am taught to re|tract my former &s;entiments. It is true, the Spartans and the Per&s;ians made a fine political u&s;e of &s;epulchral vanity; they permitted none to be thus interred, who had not fallen in the vindication of their country; a monument thus became a real mark of di&s;tinction, it nerved the heroe's arm with tenfold vigour; and he fought without fear, who only fought for a grave.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, the place of &s;epulture for the philo&s;ophers, heroes, and kings of England. What a gloom do monumental in|&s;criptions and all the venerable remains of decea&s;ed merit in&s;pire! Imagine a temple marked with the hand of antiquity, &s;olemn as religious awe, adorned with all the magnificence of barbarous profu&s;ion, dim windows, fretted pillars, long colonades, and dark ceilings, Think then, what were my &s;en&s;ations at being intro|duced
<PB N="48" REF="47">
to &s;uch a &s;cene. I &s;tood in the mid&s;t of the temple, and threw my eyes round on the walls filled with the &s;tatues, the in&s;criptions, and the monuments of the dead.</P>
<P>Alas, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, how does pride attend the puny child of du&s;t even to the grave! Even humble as I am, I po&s;&s;e&s;s more con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent &s;cene than the greate&s;t heroe of them all; they have toiled for an hour to gain a tran&s;ient immortality, and are at length retired to the grave, where they have no attendant but the worm, none to flatter but the epitaph.</P>
<P>As I was indulging &s;uch reflections, a gentleman dre&s;&s;ed in black, perceiving me to be a &s;tranger, came up, entered into conver&s;ation, and politely offered to be my in&s;tructor and guide through the temple. If any monument, &s;aid he, &s;hould particularly excite your curio&s;ity, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;atisfy your demands. I accepted with thanks the gentleman's offer, adding, that "I was come to ob&s;erve the policy, the wi&s;dom, and the ju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h, in conferring rewards upon decea&s;ed merit. If adulation like this, con|tinued I, be properly conducted, as it can no ways injure tho&s;e who are flattered, &s;o it may be a glorious incentive to tho&s;e who are now capable of enjoying it. It is the duty of every good government to turn this monumental pride to its own advantage to become &s;trong in the aggregate from the weakne&s;s of the individual. If none but the truly great have a place in this awful repo&s;itory, a temple like this will give the fine&s;t le&s;&s;ons of morality, and be a &s;trong incentive to true ambition. I am told, that
<PB N="49" REF="48">
none have a place here but characters of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed merit." The man in black &s;eemed im|patient at my ob&s;ervations, &s;o I di&s;continued my remarks, and we walked on together to take a view of every particular monument in order as it lay.</P>
<P>As the eye is naturally caught by the fine&s;t objects, I could not avoid being particularly curious about one monument which appeared more beautiful than the re&s;t; that, &s;aid I to my guide, I take to be the tomb of &s;ome very great man. By the peculiar excellence of the workman&s;hip, and the magnificence of the de&s;ign this mu&s;t be a trophy rai&s;ed to the memory of &s;ome king who has &s;aved his country from ruin, or law-giver, who has reduced his fellow-citizens from anarchy into ju&s;t &s;ubjection&mdash;It is not requi&s;ite, replied my com|panion &s;miling, to have &s;uch qualifications in order to have a very fine monument here. More humble abi|lities will &s;uffice. <HI>What, I &s;uppo&s;e then, the gaining two or three battles, or the taking half a &s;core towns, is thought a &s;ufficient qualification?</HI> Gaining battles, or taking towns, replied the man in black, may be of &s;ervice; but a gentleman may have a very fine monu|ment here without ever &s;eeing a battle or a &s;iege. <HI>This then is the monument of &s;ome poet, I pre&s;ume, of one who&s;e wit has gained him immortality?</HI> No, &s;ir, replied my guide, the gentleman who lies here never made ver&s;es; and as for wit, he de&s;pi&s;ed it in others, becau&s;e he had none him&s;elf. <HI>Pray tell me then in a word,</HI> &s;aid I peevi&s;hly, <HI>what is the great man who lies here particularly remarkable for?</HI> Remarkable, &s;ir! &s;aid my companion; why, &s;ir, the gentleman that lies here is remarkable, very remarkable&mdash;for a tomb in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. <HI>But, head of my Ance&s;tors!</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="49">
<HI>how has be got here? I fancy he could never bribe the guardians of the temple to give him a place: Should he not be a&s;hamed to be &s;een among company, where even moderate merit would look like infamy?</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, re|plied the man in black, the gentleman was rich, and his friends, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch a ca&s;e, told him he was great. He readily believed them; the guardians of the temple, as they got by the &s;elf-delu&s;ion, were ready to believe him too; &s;o he paid his money for a fine monument; and the workman, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> you &s;ee, has made him one of the mo&s;t beautiful. Think not, however, that this gentleman is &s;ingular in his de&s;ire of being buried among the great, there are &s;everal others in the temple, who, hated and &s;hunned by the great while alive, have come here, fully re&s;olved to keep them company now they are dead.</P>
<P>As we walked along to a particular part of the temple, there, &s;ays the gentleman, pointing with his finger, that is the poet's corner; there you &s;ee the monuments of Shake&s;pear, and Milton, and Prior, and Drayton. Drayton, I replied, I never heard of him before, but I have been told of one Pope, is he there? It is time enough, replied my guide, the&s;e hundred years, he is not long dead, people have not done hating him yet. Strange, cried I, can any be found to hate a man, who&s;e life was wholly &s;pent in entertaining and in&s;truct|ing his fellow creatures! Yes, &s;ays my guide, they hate him for that very rea&s;on. There are a &s;et of men called an&s;werers of books, who take upon them to watch the republic of letters, and di&s;tribute reputa|tion by the &s;heet; they &s;omewhat re&s;emble the eunuchs in a &s;eraglio, who are incapable of giving plea&s;ure them&s;elves, and hinder tho&s;e that would. The&s;e an|&s;werers
<PB N="51" REF="50">
have no other employment but to cry out Dunce, and Scribbler, to prai&s;e the dead, and revile the living, to grant a man of confe&s;&s;ed abilities &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of merit, to applaud twenty blockheads in order to gain the reputation of candour, and to revile the moral character of the man who&s;e writings they cannot injure. Such wretches are kept in pay by &s;ome mercenary book&s;eller, or more frequently the book|&s;eller him&s;elf takes this dirty work off their hands, as all that is requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> is to be very abu&s;ive and very dull; every Poet of any genius is &s;ure to find &s;uch enemies, he feels, though he &s;eems to de&s;pi&s;e their malice, they make him mi&s;erable here, and in the pur&s;uit of empty fame, at la&s;t he gains &s;olid anxiety.</P>
<P><HI>Has this been the ca&s;e with every poet I &s;ee here?</HI> cried I&mdash;Yes, with every mother's &s;on of them, re|plied he, except he happened to be born a mandarine. If he has much money, he may buy reputation from your book an&s;werers, as well as a monument from the guardians of the temple.</P>
<P><HI>But are there not &s;ome men of di&s;tingui&s;hed ta&s;te, as in China, who are willing to patronize men of merit and &s;often the rancour of malevolent dulne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>I own there are many, replied the man in black, but, alas! Sir, the book an&s;werers croud about them, and call them&s;elves the writers of books; and the patron is too indolent, to di&s;tingui&s;h; thus poets are kept at a di&s;tance, while their enemies eat up all their rewards at the mandarine's table.</P>
<P>Leaving this part of the temple, we made up to an iron gate, through which my companion told me we
<PB N="52" REF="51">
were to pa&s;s in order to &s;ee the monuments of the kings. Accordingly I marched up without further ceremony, and was going to enter, when a per&s;on who held the gate in his hand, told me I mu&s;t pay fir&s;t. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a demand; and a&s;ked the man whether the people of England kept a <HI>&s;hew?</HI> Whe|ther the paltry &s;um he demanded was not a national re|proach? Whether it was not more to the honour of the country to let their magnificence or their antiqui|ties be openly &s;een, than thus meanly to tax a curio&s;ity which tended to their own honour? As for your que&s;tions, replied the gate-keeper, to be &s;ure they may be very right, becau&s;e I don't under&s;tand them, but as for that there three-pence, I farm it from one, who rents it from another, who hires it from a third, who lea&s;es it from the guardians of the temple, and we all mu&s;t live. I expected upon paying here to &s;ee &s;omething ex|traordinary, &s;ince what I had &s;een for nothing filled me with &s;o much &s;urprize; but in this I was di&s;appointed; there was little more within than black coffins, ru&s;ty armour, tatter'd &s;tandards, and &s;ome few &s;lovenly figures in wax. I was &s;orry I had paid, but I comforted my&s;elf by con&s;idering it would be my la&s;t payment. A per&s;on attended us, who, without once blu&s;hing, told an hundred lies, he talked of a lady who died by pricking her finger, of a king with a golden head, and twenty &s;uch pieces of ab&s;urdity; Look ye there, gentlemen, &s;ays he, pointing to an old oak chair, there's a curio&s;ity for ye; in that chair the kings of England were crowned, you &s;ee al&s;o a &s;tone under|neath, and that &s;tone is Jacob's pillow. I could &s;ee no curio&s;ity either in the oak chair or the &s;tone; could I, indeed, behold one of the old kings of England &s;eated
<PB N="53" REF="52">
in this, or Jacob's head laid upon the other, there might be something curious in the &s;ight; but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, there was no more rea&s;on for my &s;urprize than if I &s;hould pick a &s;tone from their &s;treets, and call it a curio&s;ity, merely becau&s;e one of their kings happened to tread upon it as he pa&s;&s;ed in a proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From hence our conductor led us through &s;everal dark walks and winding ways, uttering lies, talking to him&s;elf, and flouri&s;hing a wand which he held in his hand. He reminded me of the black magicians of Kobi. After we had been almo&s;t fatigued with a variety of objects, he, at la&s;t, de&s;ired me to con&s;ider attentively a certain &s;uit of armour, which &s;eemed to &s;hew nothing remarkable. This armour, &s;aid he, belonged to general Monk. <HI>Very &s;urpri&s;ing, that a general &s;hould wear armour.</HI> And pray, added he, ob&s;erve this cap, this is general Monk's cap. <HI>Very &s;trange, indeed, very &s;trange, that a general &s;hould have a cap al&s;o! Pray friend, what might this cap have co&s;t originally?</HI> That, Sir, &s;ays he, I don't know, but this cap is all the wages I have for my trouble. <HI>A very &s;mall recompence, truly,</HI> &s;aid I. Not &s;o very &s;mall, replied he, for every gentleman puts &s;ome money into it, and I &s;pend the money. <HI>What, more money! &s;till more money!</HI> Every gentleman gives &s;ome|thing, &s;ir. I'll give thee nothing, returned I; the guardians of the temple &s;hould pay you your wages, friend, and not permit you to &s;queeze thus from every &s;pectator. When we pay our money at the door to &s;ee a &s;hew, we never give more as we are going out. Sure the guardians of the temple can never
<PB N="54" REF="53">
think they get enough. Shew me the gate; if I &s;tay longer, I may probably meet with more of tho&s;e eccle|&s;ia&s;tical beggars.</P>
<P>Thus leaving the temple precipitately, I returned to my lodgings, in order to ruminate over what was great, and to de&s;pi&s;e what was mean in the occurrences of the day.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS &s;ome days ago agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by a me&s;|&s;age from a lady of di&s;tinction, who &s;ent me word, that &s;he mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired the plea&s;ure of my acquaintance; and with the utmo&s;t impatience, ex|pected an interview. I will not deny, my dear Fum Hoam, but that my vanity was rai&s;ed at &s;uch an invi|tation. I flattered my&s;elf that &s;he had &s;een me in &s;ome public place, and had conceived an affection for my per&s;on, which thus induced her to deviate from the u&s;ual decorums of the &s;ex. My imagination painted her in all the bloom of youth and beauty. I fancied her attended by the loves and graces, and I &s;et out with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectations of &s;eeing the conque&s;t I had made.</P>
<P>When I was introduced into her apartment, my expectations were quickly at an end; I perceived a little &s;hrivelled figure indolently reclined on a &s;ofa, who nodded by way of approbation at my approach. This, as I was afterwards informed,
<PB N="55" REF="54">
was the lady her&s;elf, a woman equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for rank, politene&s;s, ta&s;te, and under&s;tanding. As I was dre&s;&s;ed after the fa&s;hion of Europe, &s;he had taken me for an Engli&s;hman, and con&s;equently &s;aluted me in her ordinary manner; but when the footman informed her grace that I was the gentleman from China, &s;he in&s;tantly lifted her&s;elf from the couch, while her eyes &s;parkled with unu&s;ual vivacity. "Ble&s;s me! can this be the gentleman that was born &s;o far from home? What an unu&s;ual &s;hare of <HI>&s;omethingne&s;s</HI> in his whole appearance. Lord how I am charmed with the outlandi&s;h cut of his face; how bewitching the exotic breadth of his forehead. I would give the world to &s;ee him in his own country dre&s;s. Pray turn about, Sir, and let me &s;ee you behind. There! there's a travell'd air for you. You that attend there, bring up a plate of beef cut into &s;mall pieces; I have a violent pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ee him eat. Pray, Sir, have you got your chop &s;ticks about you? It will be &s;o pretty to &s;ee the meat carried to the mouth with a jerk. Pray &s;peak a little Chine&s;e: I have learned &s;ome of the language my&s;elf. Lord, have you nothing pretty from China about you; &s;ome|thing that one does not know what to do with? I have got twenty things from China that are of no u&s;e in the world.

Sir, replied the lady; &s;ure you mi&s;take, they are of no u&s;e in the world. <HI>What! are they not filled with an infu&s;ion of tea as in China?</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="55">
replied I. Quite empty and u&s;ele&s;s upon my honour, Sir. <HI>Then they are the mo&s;t cumbrous and clum&s;y furniture in the world, as nothing is truly elegant but what unites u&s;e with beauty.</HI> I prote&s;t, &s;ays the lady, I &s;hall begin to &s;u&s;pect thee of being an actual barbarian. I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o you hold my two beautiful pagods in contempt. <HI>What!</HI> cried I, <HI>has Fohi &s;pread his gro&s;s &s;uper&s;titions here al&s;o? Pagods of all kinds are my aver&s;ion.</HI> A Chine&s;e, a traveller, and want ta&s;te! it &s;urpri&s;es me. Pray, &s;ir, examine the beauties of that Chine&s;e temple which you &s;ee at the end of the garden. Is there any thing in China more beautiful? <HI>Where I &s;tand I &s;ee nothing, madam, at the end of the garden that may not as well be called an Egyptian pyramid as a Chine&s;e temple; for that little building in view is as like the one as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">other.</HI> What! Sir, is not that a Chine&s;e temple? you mu&s;t &s;urely be mi&s;taken. Mr. Freeze, who de&s;igned it calls it one, and nobody di&s;putes his preten&s;ions to ta&s;te. I now found it vain to contradict the lady in any thing &s;he thought fit to advance: &s;o was re&s;olved rather to act the di&s;ciple than the in|&s;tructor. She took me through &s;everal rooms all fur|ni&s;hed, as &s;he told me, in the Chine&s;e manner; &s;prawl|ing dragons, &s;quatting pagods, and clum&s;y mandarines, were &s;tuck upon every &s;helf: In turning round one mu&s;t have u&s;ed caution not to demoli&s;h a part of the precarious furniture.</P>
<P>In a hou&s;e like this, thought I, one mu&s;t live conti|nually upon the watch; the inhabitant mu&s;t re&s;emble a knight in an enchanted ca&s;tle, who expects to meet an adventure at every turning. <HI>But, Madam,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>do no accidents ever happen to all this finery?</HI> Man, Sir, re|piled the lady, is born to misfortunes, and 'tis but fit I

The lion roars with terror over its captive; the tyger &s;ends forth its hideous &s;hriek to intimidate its prey; no creature &s;hews any fondne&s;s for its &s;hort-lived pri&s;oner, except a man and a cat.</P>
<P>Man was born to live with innocence and &s;implicity, but he has deviated from nature; he was born to &s;hare the bounties of heaven, but he has monopolized them; he was born to govern the brute creation, but he is become their tyrant. If an epicure now &s;hould hap|pen to &s;urfeit on his la&s;t night's fea&s;t, twenty animals the next day are to undergo the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures in order to provoke his appetite to another guilty meal. Hail, O ye &s;imple, hone&s;t bramins of the ea&s;t, ye in|offen&s;ive friends of all that were born to happine&s;s as well as you: you never &s;ought a &s;hort-lived plea&s;ure from the mi&s;eries of other creatures. You never &s;tudied the tormenting arts of ingenious refinement; you never &s;urfeited upon a guilty meal. How much more purified and refined are all your &s;en&s;ations than ours: you di&s;tingui&s;h every element with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion; a &s;tream unta&s;ted before is new luxury, a change of air is a new banquet, too refined for we&s;tern imaginations to conceive.</P>
<P>Though the Europeans do not hold the tran&s;migra|tion of &s;ouls, yet one of their doctors has, with great force of argument, and great plau&s;ibility of rea&s;oning, endeavoured to prove that the bodies of animals are the habitations of daemons and wicked &s;pirits, which are
<PB N="59" REF="58">
obliged to re&s;ide in the&s;e pri&s;ons till the re&s;urrection pronounces their everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; but are pre|viou&s;ly condemned to &s;uffer all the pains and hard&s;hips inflicted upon them by man, or by each other here. If this be the ca&s;e, it may frequently happen, that while we whip pigs to death, or boil live lob&s;ters, we are putting &s;ome old acquaintance, &s;ome near relation, to excruciating tortures, and are &s;erving him up to the very &s;ame table where he was once the mo&s;t welcome companion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Kabul, &s;ays the Zendave&s;ta, was born on the ru&s;hy banks of the river Mawra; his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were great, and his luxuries kept pace with the affluence of his fortune; he hated the harmle&s;s bramins, and de|&s;pi&s;ed their holy religion; every day his table was deck'd out with the fle&s;h of an hundred different animals, and his cooks had an hundred different ways of dre&s;&s;ing it, to &s;olicit even &s;atiety.</P> 
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding all his eating, he did not arrive at old age, he died of a &s;urfeit, cau&s;ed by intempe|rance: upon this, his &s;oul was carried off, in order to take its trial before a &s;elect a&s;&s;embly of the &s;ouls of tho&s;e animals which his gluttony had cau&s;ed to be &s;lain, and who were now appointed his judges.</P> 
<P>"He trembled before a tribunal, to every member of which, he had formerly acted as an unmerciful tyrant; he &s;ought for pity, but found none di&s;po&s;ed to grant it.

<P>I Know not whether I am more obliged to the Chine&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries for the in&s;truction I have received from them, or prejudiced by the fal&s;hoods they have made me believe. By them I was told that the Pope was univer&s;ally allowed to be a man, and placed at the head of the church; in England, however, they plainly prove him to be an whore in man's cloaths, and often burn him in effigy as an impo&s;tor. A thou&s;and books have been written on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion; prie&s;ts are eternally di&s;puting again&s;t each other; and tho&s;e mouths that want argument are filled with abu&s;e. Which party mu&s;t I believe, or &s;hall I give credit to neither? When I &s;urvey the ab&s;urdities and fal&s;ehoods with which the books of the Europeans are filled, I thank heaven for having been born in China, and that I have &s;agacity enough to detect impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Europeans reproach us with fal&s;e hi&s;tory and fabulous chronology; how &s;hould they blu&s;h to &s;ee their own books, many of which are written by the doctors of their religion filled with the mo&s;t mon&s;trous fables, and atte&s;ted with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity. The bounds of a letter, do not permit me to mention all the ab&s;urdities of this kind, which in my reading I have met with. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the ac|counts which &s;ome of their lettered men give of the per&s;ons of ome of the inhabitants on our globe.
<PB N="62" REF="61">

He is not &s;atisfied with leaving it in doubt; but in another work<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. ad fratres in Eremo, Serrm. xxxvii.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ures us, that the fact was certain, and that he him&s;elf was an eye-witne&s;s of it. <HI>When,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I took a journey into Ethiopia in company with &s;everal other &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, in order to preach the go&s;pel there; I bebeld in the &s;outhern pro|vinces of that country a nation which had only one eye in the mid&s;t of their foreheads.</HI></P>
<P>You will, no doubt, be &s;urprized, reverend Fum, with this author's effrontery; but alas he is not alone in this &s;tory; he has only borrowed it from &s;everal others who wrote before him. Solinus creates another nation of Cyclops, the Arima&s;pians who inhabit tho&s;e countries that border on the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. This author goes on to tell us of a people of India, who have but one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eg and one eye, and yet are extremely active, run with great &s;wiftne&s;s, and live by hunting. The&s;e people we &s;carce know how to pity or admire; but the men whom Pliny calls Cynamolci, who have got the heads of dogs really de&s;erve your compa&s;&s;ion. In&s;tead of language they expre&s;s their &s;entiments by barking.

<HI>de&s;arts of Egypt,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we meet with the Kunoke|phaloi, who inhabit tho&s;e regions that border on Ethiopia; they live by hunting; they cannot &s;peak, but whi&s;tle; their chins re&s;emble a &s;erpent's head; their hands are armed with long &s;harp claws; their brea&s;t re&s;embles that of a greyhound; and they excel in &s;wiftne&s;s and agility.</HI> Would you think it, my friend, that the&s;e odd kind of people are, notwith&s;tanding their figure, exce&s;&s;ively delicate; not even an alderman's wife, or Chine&s;e mandarine, can excel them in this particular. <HI>The&s;e people,</HI> continues our faithful bi&s;hop, <HI>never re|fu&s;e wine; love roa&s;t and boiled meat; they are parti|cularly curious in having their meat well dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;purn at it if in the lea&s;t tainted.

<P>Hitherto we have &s;een men with heads &s;trangely deformed, and with dog's heads; but what would you &s;ay if you heard of men without any heads at all?

<P>One would think that the&s;e authors had an anti|pathy to the human form, and were re&s;olved to make a new figure of their own: but let us do them ju&s;tice; though they &s;ometimes deprive us of a leg, an arm, an head, or &s;ome &s;uch trifling part of the body, they

often as liberally be&s;tow upon us &s;omething that we wanted before. Simon Mayole &s;eems our particular friend in this re&s;pect: if he has denied heads to one part of mankind, he has given tails to another. He de&s;cribes many of the Engli&s;h of his time, which is not more than an hundred years ago, as having tails. His own words are as follow. <HI>In England there are &s;ome families which have tails, as a puni&s;hment for deriding an Augu&s;tin Friar &s;ent by St. Gregory, and who preached in Dor&s;et&s;hire.

<P>You &s;ee, my friend, there is nothing &s;o ridiculous that has not at &s;ome time been &s;aid by &s;ome philo&s;opher.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>WERE an A&s;iatic politician to read the treaties of peace and friend&s;hip that have been annually making for more than an hundred years among the in|habitants of Europe, he would probably be &s;urpriz'd how it &s;hould ever happen that chri&s;tian princes could quarrel among each other. Their compacts for peace are drawn up with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion, and ratified with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity; to the&s;e each party pro|mi&s;es a &s;incere and inviolable obedience, and all wears the appearance of open friend&s;hip and unre&s;erved re|conciliation.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e treaties, the people of Europe are almo&s;t continually at war. There is no|thing more ea&s;y than to break a treaty ratified in all the u&s;ual forms, and yet neither party be the aggre&s;&s;or. One &s;ide, for in&s;tance, breaks a trifling article by mi&s;|take; the oppo&s;ite party upon this makes a &s;mall but premeditated repri&s;al; this brings on a return of greater from the other; both &s;ides complain of injuries and in|fractions; war is declar'd; they beat, are beaten; &s;ome two or three hundred thou&s;and men are killed, they grow tired, leave off ju&s;t where they began; and &s;o &s;it cooly down to make new treaties.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h and French &s;eem to place them&s;elves foremo&s;t among the champion &s;tates of Europe. Though parted by a narrow &s;ea, yet are they entirely of oppo&s;ite characters; and from their vicinity are taught to fear and admire each other. They are at
<PB N="66" REF="65">
pre&s;ent engaged in a very de&s;tructive war, have al|ready &s;pilled much blood, are exce&s;&s;ively irritated; and all upon account of one &s;ide's de&s;iring to wear greater quantities of <HI>furs</HI> than the other.</P>
<P>The pretext of the war is about &s;ome lands a thou|&s;and leagues off; a country cold, de&s;olate, and hideous; a country belonging to a people who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for time immemorial. The &s;avages of Canada claim a property in the country in di&s;pute; they have all the preten&s;ions which long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can confer. Here they had reigned for ages without rivals in dominion, and knew no enemies but the prowling bear or in&s;idious tyger; their native fore&s;ts produced all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and they found ample luxury in the enjoyment. In this manner they might have continued to live to eternity, had not the Engli&s;h been informed that tho&s;e countries produced furs in great abundance. From that moment the country became an object of de&s;ire; it was found that furs were things very much wanted in England; the ladies edged &s;ome of their cloaths with furs, and muffs were worn both by gentlemen and la|dies In &s;hort, furs were found indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the happine&s;s of the &s;tate: and the king was con&s;e|quently petitioned to grant not only the country of Ca|nada, but all the &s;avages belonging to it to the &s;ubjects of England, in order to have the people &s;upplied with proper quantities of this nece&s;&s;ary commodity.</P>
<P>So very rea&s;onable a reque&s;t was immediately com|plied with, and large colonies were &s;ent abroad to pro|cure furs, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The French who were equally in want of furs (for they were as fond of muffs and tippets as the Engli&s;h) made the very &s;ame reque&s;t
<PB N="70" REF="66">
to their monarch, and met with the &s;ame gracious re|ception from their king, who generou&s;ly granted what was not his to give Wherever the French landed, they called the country their own; and the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion wherever they came upon the &s;ame equi|table preten&s;ions. The harmle&s;s &s;avages made no op|po&s;ition; and could the intruders have agreed together, they might peaceably have &s;hared this de&s;olate country between them. But they quarrelled about the boun|daries of their &s;ettlements, about grounds and rivers to which neither &s;ide could &s;hew any other right than that of power, and which neither could occupy but by u&s;urpation. Such is the conte&s;t, that no hone&s;t man can heartily wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to either party.</P>
<P>The war has continued for &s;ome time with various &s;ucce&s;s. At fir&s;t the French &s;eemed victorious; but the Engli&s;h have of late di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of the whole country in di&s;pute. Think not, however, that &s;uc|ce&s;s on one &s;ide is the harbinger of peace: on the con|trary, both parties mu&s;t be heartily tired to effect even a temporary reconciliation. It &s;hould &s;eem the bu&s;ine&s;s of the victorious party to offer terms of peace; but there are many in England, who, encouraged by &s;uc|ce&s;s, are &s;till for protracting the war.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Engli&s;h politicians, however, are &s;en&s;ible, that to keep their pre&s;ent conque&s;ts, would be rather a burthen than an advantage to them rather a diminution of their &s;trength than an encrea&s;e of power It is in the politic as in the human con&s;titution; if the limbs grow too large for the body, their &s;ize, in&s;tead of im|proving, will dimini&s;h the vigour of the whole. The colonies &s;hould always bear an exact proportion to the
<PB N="68" REF="67">
mother country; when they grow populous, they grow powerful, and by becoming powerful, they be|come independent al&s;o; thus &s;ubordination is de&s;troyed, and a country &s;wallowed up in the extent of its own do|minions. The Turki&s;h empire would be more for|midable, were it le&s;s exten&s;ive. Were it not for tho&s;e countries, which it can neither command, nor give en|tirely away, which it is obliged to protect, but from which it has no power to exact obedience.</P>
<P>Yet, obvious as the&s;e truths are, there are many En|gli&s;hmen who are for tran&s;planting new colonies into this late acqui&s;ition, for peopling the de&s;arts of Ame|rica with the refu&s;e of their countrymen, and (as they expre&s;s it) with the wa&s;te of an exuberant nation. But who are tho&s;e unhappy creatures who are to be thus drained away? Not the &s;ickly, for they are unwelcome gue&s;ts abroad as well as at home; nor the idle, for they would &s;tarve as well behind the Appalachian mountains as in the &s;treets of London. This refu&s;e is compo&s;ed of the laborious and enterpri&s;ing, of &s;uch men as can be &s;erviceable to their country at home, of men who ought to be regarded as the &s;inews of the peo|ple, and cheri&s;hed with every degree of political in|dulgence. And what are the commodities which this colony, when e&s;tabli&s;hed, are to produce in return? Why raw &s;ilk, hemp, and tobacco. England, there|fore, mu&s;t make an exchange of her be&s;t and brave&s;t &s;ubjects for raw &s;ilk, hemp, and tobacco; her hardy veterans and hone&s;t trade&s;men, mu&s;t be truck'd for a box of &s;nuff or a &s;ilk petticoat. Strange ab&s;urdity! Sure the politics of the Daures are not more &s;trange, who &s;ell their religion, their wives, and their liberty for a gla&s;s bead, or a paltry penknife.</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h love their wives with much pa&s;|&s;ion, the Hollanders with much prudence. The Engli&s;h when they give their hands, frequently give their hearts; the Dutch give the hand, but keep the heart wi&s;ely in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Engli&s;h love with violence, and expect violent love in return; the Dutch are &s;atisfied with the &s;lighte&s;t acknowledg|ments, for they give little away. The Engli&s;h expend many of the matrimonial comforts in the fir&s;t year; the Dutch frugally hu&s;band out their plea&s;ures, and are al|ways con&s;tant becau&s;e they are always indifferent.</P>
<P>There &s;eems very little difference between a Dutch bridegroom and a Dutch hu&s;band. Both are equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame cool unexpecting &s;erenity; they can &s;ee neither Ely&s;ium nor Paradi&s;e behind the cur|tain; and <HI>Yiffrow</HI> is not more a godde&s;s on the wed|ding night, than after twenty years matrimonial ac|quaintance. On the other hand, many of the Engli&s;h marry, in order to have one happy month in their lives; they &s;eem incapable of looking beyond that period; they unite in hopes of finding rapture, and di&s;appointed in that, di&s;dain ever to accept of happine&s;s. From hence we &s;ee open hatred en&s;ue; or what is wor&s;e, con|cealed di&s;gu&s;t under the appearance of ful&s;ome endear|ment. Much formality, great civility, and &s;tudied compliments are exhibited in public; cro&s;s looks, &s;ulky &s;ilence, or open recrimination, fill up their hours of private entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">
Hence I am taught, whenever I &s;ee a new married couple more than ordinarily &s;ond before faces, to con&s;i|der them as attempting to impo&s;e upon the company or them&s;elves, either hating each other heartily, or con|&s;uming that &s;tock of love in the beginning of their cour&s;e, which &s;hould &s;erve them through their whole journey. Neither &s;ide &s;hould expect tho&s;e in&s;tances of kindne&s;s which are incon&s;i&s;tent with true freedom or happine&s;s to be&s;tow. Love, when founded in the heart, will &s;hew it&s;elf in a thou&s;and unpremeditated &s;allies of fondne&s;s; but every cool deliberate exhibition of the pa&s;&s;ion, only argues little under&s;tanding, or great in&s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>Choang was the fonde&s;t hu&s;band, and Han&s;i the mo&s;t endearing wife in all the kingdom of Korea: they were a pattern of conjugal bli&s;s; the inhabitants of the country around &s;aw, and envied their felicity; where|ever Choang came, Han&s;i was &s;ure to follow; and in all the plea&s;ures of Han&s;i, Choang was admitted a part|ner. They walked hand in hand wherever they ap|peared, &s;hewing every mark of mutual &s;atisfaction, em|bracing, ki&s;&s;ing, their mouths were for ever joined, and to &s;peak in the language of anatomy, it was with them one perpetual ana&s;tomo&s;is.</P>
<P>Their love was &s;o great, that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, dimini&s;hed the hu&s;band's a&s;&s;urance of his wife's fidelity; for love &s;o refined as his, was &s;ubject to a thou&s;and little di&s;quie|tudes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70">
Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, he there perceived a lady dre&s;&s;ed in the deepe&s;t mourning, (being cloathed all over in white) fanning the wet clay that was rai&s;ed over one of the graves with a large fan, which &s;he held in her hand. Choang, who had early been taught wi&s;|dom in the &s;chool of Lao, was unable to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for her pre&s;ent employment; and coming up, civilly demanded the rea&s;on. Alas, replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears; how is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band, who lies buried in this grave; he was the be&s;t of men, the tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands; with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave &s;hould be dry; and here you &s;ee me &s;tea|dily re&s;olving to obey his will, and endeavouring to dry it with my fan. I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his commands, and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave &s;hould take up four days in drying.</P>
<P>Choang, who was &s;truck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid &s;miling at her ha&s;te to be married; but, concealing the cau&s;e of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her &s;ome con&s;olation. As &s;oon as he and his gue&s;t were returned, he imparted to Han&s;i in private what he had &s;een, and could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing his unea&s;ine&s;s, that &s;uch might be his own ca&s;e if his deare&s;t wife &s;hould one day happen to &s;urvive him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe Han&s;i's re&s;entment at &s;o unkind a &s;u&s;picion. As her pa&s;&s;ion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, &s;he employed tears,

anger, frowns, and exclamations, to chide his &s;u&s;pi|cions; the widow her&s;elf was inveighed again&s;t; and Han&s;i declared &s;he was re&s;olved never to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with a wretch, who, like her, could be guilty of &s;uch barefac'd incon&s;tancy. The night was cold and &s;tormy; however, the &s;tranger was obliged to &s;eek another lodging, for Choang was not di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t, and Han&s;i would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had &s;carce been gone an hour, when an old di&s;ciple of Choang's, whom he had not &s;een for many years, came to pay him a vi&s;it. He was received with the utmo&s;t ceremony, placed in the mo&s;t honour|able &s;eat at &s;upper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. Choang and Han&s;i exhibited open marks of mutual tenderne&s;s, and unfeigned re|conciliation: nothing could equal their apparent hap|pine&s;s; &s;o fond an hu&s;band, &s;o obedient a wife, few could behold without regretting their own infelicity. When, lo! their happine&s;s was at once di&s;turbed by a mo&s;t fatal accident. Choang fell lifele&s;s in an apoplec|tic fit upon the floor. Every method was u&s;ed, but in vain, for his recovery. Han&s;i was at fir&s;t incon&s;olable for his death: after &s;ome hours, however, &s;he found &s;pirits to read his la&s;t will. The en&s;uing day &s;he began to moralize and talk wi&s;dom; the next day &s;he was able to comfort the young di&s;ciple; and, on the third, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was now no longer mourning in the apart|ments; the body of Choang was now thru&s;t into an old coffin, and placed in one of the meane&s;t rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre&s;cribed by law for his interment. In the mean time Han&s;i, and the
<PB N="73" REF="72">
young di&s;ciple, were arrayed in the mo&s;t magnificent habits; the bride wore in her no&s;e a jewel of immen&s;e price, and her lover was dre&s;&s;ed in all the finery of his former ma&s;ter, together with a pair of artificial whi&s;k|ers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nuptials was arrived; the whole family &s;ympathized with their approaching happine&s;s; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite perfume, and a lu&s;tre more bright than noon day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apart|ment with impatience; when his &s;ervant approaching with terror in his countenance, informed her, that his ma&s;ter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unle&s;s the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his brea&s;t. She &s;carce waited to hear the end of his &s;tory, when, tucking up her cloaths, &s;he ran with a mattock in her hand to the cof|fin, where Choang lay, re&s;olving to apply the heart of her dead hu&s;band as a cure for the living. She there|fore &s;truck the lid with the utmo&s;t violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which, to all appearance had been dead, began to move. Terri|fied at the &s;ight, Han&s;i dropped the mattock, and Cho|ang walked out, a&s;toni&s;hed at his own &s;ituation, his wife's unu&s;ual magnificence, and her more amazing &s;ur|prize. He went among the apartments, unable to con|ceive the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;plendor. He was not long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e before his dome&s;tics informed him of every tran&s;action &s;ince he fir&s;t became in&s;en&s;ible. He could &s;carce believe what they told him, and went in pur&s;uit of Han&s;i her&s;elf, in order to receive more certain infor|mation, or to reproach her infidelity. But &s;he pre|vented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood;
<PB N="74" REF="73">
for &s;he had &s;tabbed her&s;elf to the heart, being unable to &s;urvive her &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Choang, being a philo&s;opher, was too wi&s;e to make any loud lamentations; he thought it be&s;t to bear his lo&s;s with &s;erenity; &s;o, mending up the old coffin where he had lain him&s;elf, he placed his faithle&s;s &s;pou&s;e in his room; and, unwilling that &s;o many nuptial pre|parations &s;hould be expended in vain, he the &s;ame night married the widow with the large fan.</P>
<P>As they both were appri&s;ed of the foibles of each other before hand, they knew how to excu&s;e them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not expecting rapture, made a &s;hift to find contentment.</P>

<P>THE gentleman dre&s;&s;ed in black, who was my companion through We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, came ye&s;terday to pay me a vi&s;it; and after drinking tea, we both re&s;olved to take a walk together, in order to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of the country, which now begins to re|&s;ume its verdure. Before we got out of the &s;uburbs, however, we were &s;topped in one of the &s;treets by a crowd of people, gathered in a circle round a man and his wife, who &s;eemed too loud and too angry to be un|der&s;tood. The people were highly plea&s;ed with the di&s;pute, which upon enquiry we found to be between Dr. Cacafogo an apothecary, and his wife. The doc|tor,
<PB N="75" REF="74">
it &s;eems, coming unexpectedly into his wife's apart|ment, found a gentleman there in circum&s;tances not in the lea&s;t equivocal.</P>
<P>The doctor, who was a per&s;on of nice honour, re|&s;olving to revenge the flagrant in&s;ult, immediately flew to the chimney-piece, and taking down a ru&s;ty blunder|bu&s;s, drew the trigger upon the defiler of his bed; the delinquent would certainly have been &s;hot through the head, but that the piece had not been charged for many years. The gallant made a &s;hift to e&s;cape through the window, but the lady &s;till remained; and as &s;he well knew her hu&s;band's temper, undertook to manage the quarrel without a &s;econd. He was furious, and &s;he loud; their noi&s;e had gathered all the mob who cha|ritably a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion, not to prevent, but to enjoy the quarrel.</P>
<P>Alas, &s;aid I to my companion, what will become of this unhappy creature thus caught in adultery! Believe me, I pity her from my heart; her hu&s;band, I &s;uppo&s;e, will &s;hew her no mercy. Will they burn her as in In|dia, or behead her as in Per&s;ia; will they load her with &s;tripes as in Turkey, or keep her in perpetual impri|&s;onment, as with us in China! Prythee, what is the wife's puni&s;hment in England for &s;uch offences? When a lady is thus caught tripping, replied my companion, they never puni&s;h her, but the hu&s;band. You &s;urely je&s;t, interrupted I; I am a foreigner, and you would abu&s;e my ignorance! I am really &s;erious, returned he; Dr. Cacafogo has caught his wife in the act; but as he had no witne&s;&s;es, his &s;mall te&s;timony goes for nothing; the con&s;equence therefore of his di&s;covery will be, that &s;he may be packed off to live among her relations, and
<PB N="76" REF="75">
the doctor mu&s;t be obliged to allow her a &s;eparate main|tenance. Amazing, cried I! is it not enough that &s;he is permitted to live &s;eparate from the object &s;he dete&s;ts, but mu&s;t he give her money to keep her in &s;pirits too? That he mu&s;t, &s;ays my guide; and be called a cuckold by all his neighbours into the bargain. The men will laugh at him, the ladies will pity him; and all that his warme&s;t friends can &s;ay in his favour, will be, that the <HI>poor good &s;oul has never had any harm in him.</HI> I want patience, interrupted I; what! are there no private cha&s;ti&s;ements for the wife; no &s;chools of penitence to &s;hew her her folly; no rods for &s;uch delinquents? P&s;ha, man, replied he &s;miling; if every delinquent among us were to be treated in your manner, one half of the kingdom would flog the other.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my dear Fum, that if I were an En|gli&s;h hu&s;band, of all things I would take care not to be jealous, nor bu&s;ily pry into the&s;e &s;ecrets my wife was plea&s;ed to keep from me. Should I detect her infide|lity, what is the con&s;equence? If I calmly pocket the abu&s;e, I am laughed at by her and her gallant; if I talk my griefs aloud like a tragedy heroe, I am laughed at by the whole world. The cour&s;e then I'd take would be, whenever I went out, to tell my wife where I was going, le&s;t I &s;hould unexpectedly meet her abroad in company with &s;ome dear deceiver. Whenever I re|turned, I would u&s;e a peculiar rap at the door, and give four loud hems as I walked deliberately up the &s;tair-ca&s;e. I would never inqui&s;itively peep under her bed, or look behind the curtains. And even though I knew the captain was there, I would calmly take a di&s;h of my wife's cool tea, and talk of the army with re|verence.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76">
Of all nations, the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eem to me to behave mo&s;t wi&s;ely in &s;uch circum&s;tances. The wife promi&s;es her hu&s;band never to let him &s;ee her tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this nature; and he as punctually promi&s;es, whenever &s;he is &s;o detected, without the lea&s;t anger, to beat her without mercy: &s;o they both know what each has to expect; the lady tran&s;gre&s;&s;es, is beaten, taken again into favour, and all goes on as before.</P>
<P>When a Ru&s;&s;ian young lady, therefore, is to be mar|ried, her father, with a cudgel in his hand, a&s;ks the bridegroom, whether he chu&s;es this virgin for his bride? to which the other replies in the affirmative. Upon this, the father turning the lady three times round, and giving her three &s;trokes with his cudgel on the back; <HI>my dear,</HI> cries he, <HI>the&s;e are the la&s;t blows you are ever to receive from your tender father, I re&s;ign my autho|rity, and my cudgel to your hu&s;band; he knows better than me the u&s;e of either.</HI> The bridegroom knows de|corums too well to accept of the cudgel abruptly; he a&s;&s;ures the father that the lady will never want it, and that he would not for the world make any u&s;e of it. But the father, who knows what the lady may want better than he, in&s;i&s;ts upon his acceptance. Upon this, there follows a &s;cene of Ru&s;&s;ian politene&s;s, while one refu&s;es, and the other offers the cudgel. The whole, however, ends with the bridegroom's taking it, upon which the lady drops a courte&s;y in token of obedience, and the ceremony proceeds as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exce&s;&s;ively fair and open in this method of court&s;hip. By this, both &s;ides are prepared for all the matrimonial adventures that are to follow. Marriage has been compared to a game of &s;kill for life;
<PB N="78" REF="77">
it is generous thus in both parties to declare they are &s;harpers in the beginning. In England, I am told both &s;ides u&s;e every art to conceal their defects from each other before marriage, and the re&s;t of their lives may be regarded as doing penance for their former di&s;&s;imu|lation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE republic of letters</HI> is a very common ex|pre&s;&s;ion among the Europeans; and yet when applied to the learned of Europe, is the mo&s;t ab&s;urd that can be imagined, &s;ince nothing is more unlike a republic than the &s;ociety which goes by that name. From this expre&s;&s;ion one would be apt to imagine, that the learned were united into a &s;ingle body, joining their intere&s;ts, and concurring in the &s;ame de&s;ign. From this one might be apt to compare them to our literary &s;ocieties in China, where each acknowledges a ju&s;t &s;ub|ordination; and all contribute to build the temple of &s;cience, without attempting from ignorance or envy to ob&s;truct each other.</P>
<P>But very different is the &s;tate of learning here; every member of this fancied republic is de&s;irous of govern|ing, and none willing to obey; each looks upon his fel|low as a rival, not an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the &s;ame pur&s;uit. They calumniate, they injure, they de&s;pi&s;e, they ridi|cule each other: if one man writes a book that plea&s;es, others &s;hall write books to &s;hew that he might have given &s;till greater plea&s;ure, or &s;hould not have plea&s;ed. If one happens to hit upon &s;omething new, there are
<PB N="79" REF="78">
numbers ready to a&s;&s;ure the publick that all this was no novelty to them or the learned; that Cardanus or Bru|nus, or &s;ome other author too dull to be generally read, had anticipated the di&s;covery. Thus, in&s;tead of unit|ing like the members of a commonwealth, they are divided into almo&s;t as many factions as there are men; and their jarring con&s;titution, in&s;tead of being &s;tiled a republic of letters, &s;hould be entituled, an anarchy of literature.</P>
<P>It is true, there are &s;ome of &s;uperior abilities who reverence and e&s;teem each other; but their mutual ad|miration is not &s;ufficient to &s;hield off the contempt of the crowd. The wi&s;e are but few, and they prai&s;e with a feeble voice; the vulgar are many, and roar in reproaches. The truly great &s;eldom unite in &s;ocieties, have few meetings, no cabals; the dunces hunt in full cry till they have run down a reputation, and then &s;narl and fight with each other about dividing the &s;poil. Here you may &s;ee the compilers, and the book-an&s;wer|ers of every month, when they have cut up &s;ome re|&s;pectable name, mo&s;t frequently reproaching each other with &s;tupidity and dullne&s;s: re&s;embling the wolves of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ore&s;t, who prey upon veni&s;on, or hor&s;e|fle&s;h when they can get it; but in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, ly|ing in wait to devour each other. While they have new books to cut up, they make a hearty meal; but if this re&s;ource &s;hould unhappily fail, then it is that cri|tics eat up critics, and compilers rob from compilations.</P>
<P>Confucius ob&s;erves that it is the duty of the learned to unite &s;ociety more clo&s;ely, and to per&s;uade men to become citizens of the world; but the authors I refer to, are not only for di&s;uniting &s;ociety, but kingdoms
<PB N="80" REF="79">
al&s;o; if the Engli&s;h are at war with France, the dunces of France think it their duty to be at war with tho&s;e of England. Thus Freron, one of their fir&s;t rate &s;crib|lers, thinks proper to characteri&s;e all the Engli&s;h writers in the gro&s;s. Their whole merit, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">'con&s;i&s;ts in exaggeration, and often in extravagance; correct their pieces as you plea&s;e, there &s;till remains a leaven which <HI>corrupts</HI> the whole. They &s;ometimes di&s;cover genius, but not the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of ta&s;te, England is not a &s;oil for the plants of genius to thrive in.'</Q> This is open enough, with not the lea&s;t adulation in the pic|ture; but hear what a Frenchman of acknowledged abilities &s;ays upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, <Q REND="inline">'I am at a lo&s;s to determine in what we excel the Engli&s;h, or where they excel us; when I compare the merits of both in any one &s;pecies of literary compo&s;ition, &s;o many re|putable and plea&s;ing writers pre&s;ent them&s;elves from either country, that my judgment re&s;ts in &s;u&s;pen&s;e: I am plea&s;ed with the di&s;qui&s;ition, without finding the object of my enquiry.'</Q> But le&s;t you &s;hould think the French alone are faulty in this re&s;pect, hear how an Engli&s;h journali&s;t delivers his &s;entiments of them. <Q REND="inline">'We are amazed, &s;ays he, to find &s;o many works tran&s;lated from the French, while we have &s;uch numbers ne|glected of our own. In our opinion, notwith&s;tanding their &s;ame throughout the re&s;t of Europe, the French are the mo&s;t contemptible rea&s;oners (we had almo&s;t &s;aid writers) that can be imagined. However, ne|verthele&s;s, excepting, &amp;c.'</Q> Another Engli&s;h writer, Shaft&s;bury, if I remember, on the contrary, &s;ays, that the French authors are plea&s;ing and judicious, more clear, more methodical, and entertaining than tho&s;e of his own country.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">
From the&s;e oppo&s;ite pictures, you perceive that the good authors of either country prai&s;e, and the bad re|vile each other; and yet, perhaps, you'll be &s;urprized that indifferent writers &s;hould thus be the mo&s;t apt to cen&s;ure, as they have the mo&s;t to apprehend from re|crimination; you may, perhaps, imagine that &s;uch as are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ame them&s;elves &s;hould be mo&s;t ready to declare their opinions, &s;ince what they &s;ay, might pa&s;s for deci&s;ion. But the truth happens to be, that the great are &s;olicitous only of rai&s;ing their own reputa|tions, while the oppo&s;ite cla&s;s, alas! are &s;olicitous of bringing every reputation down to a level with their own.</P>
<P>But let us acquit them of malice and envy; a critic is often guided by the &s;ame motives that direct his author. The author endeavours to per&s;uade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally &s;olicitous to &s;hew that he could write a better, had he thought pro|per. A critic is a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a &s;cholar; incapable, from his native weakne&s;s, of lifting him&s;elf from the ground, he ap|plies to contiguous merit for &s;upport, makes the &s;por|tive &s;allies of another's imagination his &s;erious employ|ment, pretends to take our feelings under his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the empha&s;is of prai&s;e, and may with as much ju&s;tice be called a man of ta&s;te, as the Chine&s;e who mea&s;ures his wi&s;dom by the length of his nails.</P>
<P>If then a book, &s;pirited or humourous, happens to appear in the republic of letters, &s;everal critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a &s;ingle line of it, for them&s;elves had read it; and they know what is
<PB N="82" REF="81">
mo&s;t proper to excite laughter. Other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal, call them all &s;piders, and a&s;&s;ure the public, that they ought to laugh with|out re&s;traint. Another &s;et are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book, intended to &s;hew the particular pa&s;&s;ages to be laughed at; when the&s;e are out, others &s;till there are who write notes upon notes. Thus a &s;ingle new book employs not only the paper-makers, the printers, the pre&s;s-men, the book|binders, the hawkers, but twenty critics, and as many compilers. In &s;hort, the body of the learned may be compared to a Per&s;ian army, where there are many pioneers, &s;everal &s;utlers, numberle&s;s &s;ervants, women and children in abundance, and but few &s;oldiers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h are as fond of &s;eeing plays acted as the Chine&s;e; but there is a va&s;t difference in the manner of conducting them. We play our pieces in the open air, the Engli&s;h theirs under cover; we act by day-light, they by the blaze of torches. One of our plays continues eight or ten days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; an Engli&s;h piece &s;eldom takes up above four hours in the repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>My companion in black, with whom I am now be|ginning to contract an intimacy, introduced me a few nights ago to the play-hou&s;e, where we placed our&s;elves conveniently at the foot of the &s;tage. As the curtain
<PB N="83" REF="82">
was not drawn before my arrival, I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving the behaviour of the &s;pectators, and in|dulging tho&s;e reflections which novelty generally in|&s;pires.</P>
<P>The rich in general were placed in the lowe&s;t &s;eats, and the poor ro&s;e above them in degrees proportioned to their poverty. The order of precedence &s;eemed here inverted; tho&s;e who were undermo&s;t all the day, now enjoyed a temporary eminence, and became ma&s;|ters of the ceremonies. It was they who called for the mu&s;ic, indulging every noi&s;y freedom, and te&s;tifying all the in&s;olence of beggary in exaltation.</P>
<P>They who held the middle region &s;eemed not &s;o riotous as tho&s;e above them, nor yet &s;o tame as tho&s;e below; to judge by their looks, many of them &s;eem'd &s;trangers there as well as my&s;elf. They were chiefly employed during this period of expectation in eating oranges, reading the &s;tory of the play, or making a&s;|&s;ignations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;at in the lowe&s;t rows, which are called the pit, &s;eemed to con&s;ider them&s;elves as judges of the merit of the poet and the performers; they were a&s;|&s;embled partly to be amu&s;ed, and partly to &s;hew their ta&s;te; appearing to labour under that re&s;traint which an affectation of &s;uperior di&s;cernment generally pro|duces. My companion, however, informed me, that not one in an hundred of them knew even the fir&s;t principles of critici&s;m; that they a&s;&s;umed the right of being cen&s;ors becau&s;e there was none to contradict their preten&s;ions; and that every man who now called him|&s;elf a connoi&s;&s;eur, became &s;uch to all intents and pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="83">
Tho&s;e who &s;at in the boxes appeared in the mo&s;t un|happy &s;ituation of all. The re&s;t of the audience came merely for their own amu&s;ement; the&s;e rather to fur|ni&s;h out a part of the entertainment them&s;elves. I could not avoid con&s;idering them as acting parts in dumb &s;hew, not a curte&s;y or nod, that was not the re&s;ult of art; not a look nor a &s;mile that was not de&s;igned for murder. Gentlemen and ladies ogled each other through &s;pectacles; for my companion ob&s;erved, that blindne&s;s was of late become fa&s;hionable, all affected indifference and ea&s;e, while their hearts at the &s;ame time burned for conque&s;t. Upon the whole, the lights, the mu&s;ic, the ladies in their gaye&s;t dre&s;&s;es, the men with chearfulne&s;s and expectation in their looks, all con|&s;pired to make a mo&s;t agreeable picture, and to fill an heart that &s;ympathi&s;es at human happine&s;s with inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;erenity.</P>
<P>The expected time for the play to begin at la&s;t ar|rived, the curtain was drawn, and the actors came on. A woman, who per&s;onated a queen, came in curte&s;ying to the audience, who clapped their hands upon her ap|pearance. Clapping of hands is, it &s;eems, the manner of applauding in England: the manner is ab&s;urd; but every country, you know, has its peculiar ab&s;urdities. I was equally &s;urpri&s;ed, however, at the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the actre&s;s, who &s;hould have con&s;idered her&s;elf as a queen, as at the little di&s;cernment of the audience who gave her &s;uch marks of applau&s;e before &s;he attempted to de&s;erve them. Preliminaries between her and the audience being thus adju&s;ted, the dialogue was &s;up|ported between her and a mo&s;t hopeful youth, who acted the part of her confidant. They both appeared in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, for it &s;eems the queen had lo&s;t a
<PB N="85" REF="84">
child &s;ome fifteen years before, and &s;till kept its dear re&s;emblance next her heart, while her kind companion bore a part in her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Her lamentations grew loud. Comfort is offered, but &s;he dete&s;ts the very &s;ound. She bids them preach comfort to the winds. Upon this her hu&s;band comes in, who, &s;eeing the queen &s;o much afflicted, can him|&s;elf hardly refrain from tears or avoid partaking in the &s;oft di&s;tre&s;s. After thus grieving through three &s;cenes, the curtain dropped for the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid I to my companion, the&s;e kings and queens are very much di&s;turbed at no very great mis|fortune; certain I am were people of humbler &s;tations to act in this manner, they would be thought dive&s;ted of common &s;en&s;e. I had &s;carce fini&s;hed this ob&s;ervation, when the curtain ro&s;e, and the king came on in a vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion. His wife had, it &s;eems, refu&s;ed his prof|fered tenderne&s;s, had &s;purned his royal embrace; and he &s;eemed re&s;olved not to &s;urvive her fierce di&s;dain. After he had thus fretted, and the queen had fretted through the &s;econd act, the curtain was let down once more.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ays my companion, you perceive the king to be a man of &s;pirit, he feels at every pore; one of your phlegmatic &s;ons of clay would have given the queen her own way, and let her come to her&s;elf by degrees; but the king is for immediate tenderne&s;s, or in&s;tant death: death and tenderne&s;s are leading pa&s;&s;ions of every mo|dern bu&s;kin'd heroe; this moment they embrace, and the next &s;tab, mixing daggers and ki&s;&s;es in every period.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="85">
I was going to &s;econd his remarks, when my attention was engro&s;&s;ed by a new object; a man came in ba|lancing a &s;traw upon his no&s;e, and the audience were clapping their hands in all the raptures of applau&s;e. To what purpo&s;e, cried I, does this unmeaning figure make his appearance; is he a part of the plot? Un|meaning do you call him, replied my friend in black; this is one of the mo&s;t important characters of the whole play; nothing plea&s;es the people more than the &s;eeing a &s;traw balanced; there is a great deal of meaning in the &s;traw; there is &s;omething &s;uited to every appre|hen&s;ion in the &s;ight; and a fellow po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents like the&s;e is &s;ure of making his fortune.</P>
<P>The third act now began with an actor, who came to inform us that he was the villain of the play, and in|tended to &s;hew &s;trange things before all was over. He was joined by another, who &s;eem'd as much di&s;po&s;ed for mi&s;chief as he; their intrigues continued through this whole divi&s;ion. If that be a villain, &s;aid I, he mu&s;t be a very &s;tupid one, to tell his &s;ecrets without being a&s;k'd; &s;uch &s;oliloquies of late are never admitted in China.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of clapping interrupted me once more; a child of &s;ix years old was learning to dance on the &s;tage, which gave the ladies and mandarines infinite &s;atisfac|tion. I am &s;orry, &s;aid I, to &s;ee the pretty creature &s;o early learning &s;o very bad a trade. Dancing being, I pre&s;ume, as contemptible here as it is in China. Quite the rever&s;e, interrupted my companion; dancing is a very reputable and genteel employment here; men have a greater chance for encouragement from the merit of their heels than their heads. One who jumps up and
<PB N="87" REF="86">
flouri&s;hes his toes three times before he comes to the ground, may have three hundred a year; he who flou|ri&s;hes them four times, gets four hundred; but he who arrives at five is ine&s;timable, and may demand what &s;alary he thinks proper. The female dancers too are valued for this &s;ort of jumping and cro&s;&s;ing; and 'tis a cant word among them, that &s;he de&s;erves mo&s;t who &s;hews highe&s;t. But the fourth act is begun, let us be attentive.</P>
<P>In the fourth act the queen finds her long lo&s;t child, now grown up into a youth of &s;mart parts and great qualifications; wherefore &s;he wi&s;ely con&s;iders that the crown will fit his head better than that of her hu&s;band, whom &s;he knows to be a driveler. The king di&s;covers her de&s;ign, and here comes on the deep di&s;tre&s;s; he loves the queen, and he loves the kingdom; he re&s;olves therefore, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s both, that her &s;on mu&s;t die. The queen exclaims at his barbarity; is frantic with rage, and at length overcome with &s;orrow, falls into a fit; upon which the curtain drops, and the act is concluded.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the art of the poet, cries my companion; when the queen can &s;ay no more, &s;he falls into a fit. While thus her eyes are &s;hut, while &s;he is &s;upported in the arms of Abigail, what horrors do we not fancy, we feel it in every nerve; take my word for it, that fits are the true apo&s;iope&s;is of modern tragedy.</P>
<P>The fifth act began, and a bu&s;y piece it was. Scenes &s;hifting, trumpets &s;ounding, mobs hallooing, carpets &s;preading, guards bu&s;tling from one door to another; gods, daemons, daggers, racks and rat&s;bane. But
<PB N="88" REF="87">
whether the king was killed, or the queen was drowned, or the &s;on was poi&s;oned, I have ab&s;olutely forgotten.</P>
<P>When the play was over, I could not avoid ob&s;erving, that the per&s;ons of the drama appeared in as much di&s;|tre&s;s in the fir&s;t act as the la&s;t: how is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, to &s;ympathize with them through five long acts; pity is but a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion; I hate to hear an actor mouthing trifles, neither &s;tartings, &s;trainings, nor atti|tudes affect me unle&s;s there be cau&s;e: after I have been once or twice deceived by tho&s;e unmeaning alarms, my heart &s;leeps in peace, probably unaffected by the prin|cipal di&s;tre&s;s. There &s;hould be one great pa&s;&s;ion aimed at by the actor as well as the poet, all the re&s;t &s;hould be &s;ubordinate, and only contribute to make that the greater; if the actor therefore exclaims upon every oc|ca&s;ion in the tones of de&s;pair, he attempts to move us too &s;oon; he anticipates the blow, he cea&s;es to affect though he gains our applau&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;carce perceived that the audience were almo&s;t all departed; wherefore, mixing with the crowd, my companion and I got into the &s;treet; where e&s;&s;aying an hundred ob&s;tacles from coach wheels and palanquin poles, like birds in their flight through the branches of a fore&s;t, after various turnings, we both at length got home in &s;afety.</P>

<P>Every account I receive from the ea&s;t &s;eems to come loaded with &s;ome new affliction. My wife and daughter were taken from me, and yet I &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s with intrepidity; my &s;on is made a &s;lave among barbarians, which was the only blow that could have reached my heart: yes, I will indulge the tran&s;ports of nature for a little, in order to &s;hew I can overcome them in the end. <HI>True magnanimity con&s;i&s;ts not in</HI> NEVER <HI>falling, but in</HI> RISING <HI>every time we fall.</HI></P>
<P>When our mighty emperor had publi&s;hed his di&s;|plea&s;ure at my departure, and &s;eized upon all that was mine, my &s;on was privately &s;ecreted from his re&s;ent|ment. Under the protection and guardian&s;hip of Fum Hoam, the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t of all the inhabitants of China; he was for &s;ome time in&s;tructed in the learning of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the wi&s;dom of the ea&s;t. But hearing of my adventures, and incited by filial piety, he was re&s;olved to follow my fortunes, and &s;hare my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="89">
He pa&s;&s;ed the confines of China in di&s;gui&s;e; hired him&s;elf as a camel-driver to a caravan that was cro&s;&s;ing the de&s;arts of Thibet, and was within one day's jour|ney of the river Laur, which divides that country from India; when a body of wandering Tartars falling un|expectedly upon the caravan, plundered it, and made tho&s;e who e&s;caped their fir&s;t fury &s;laves. By tho&s;e he was led into the exten&s;ive and de&s;olate regions that border on the &s;hores of the Aral lake.</P>
<P>Here he lived by hunting; and was obliged to &s;up|ply every day a certain proportion of the &s;poil to regale his &s;avage ma&s;ters; his learning, his virtues, and even his beauty were qualifications that no way &s;erved to re|commend him; they knew no merit but that of pro|viding large quantities of milk and raw fle&s;h; and were &s;en&s;ible of no happine&s;s but that of rioting on the un|dre&s;&s;ed meal.</P>
<P>Some merchants from Me&s;ched, however, coming to trade with the Tartars, for &s;laves, he was &s;old among the number, and led into the kingdom of Per&s;ia, where he is now detained.

<P>That trea&s;ure which I &s;till kept within my bo&s;om, my child, my all that was left to me, is now a &s;lave.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This whole apo&s;trophe &s;eems mo&s;t literally tran&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ted from Ambulaaohamed, the Arabian poet.</NOTE> Good heavens, why was this! why have I been intro|duced into this mortal apartment, to be a &s;pectator of my own misfortunes, and the misfortunes of my fellow

Rea&s;on cannot re&s;olve. It lends a ray to &s;hew the horrors of my pri&s;on, but not a light to guide me to e&s;cape them. Ye boa&s;ted revelations of the earth, how little do you aid the enquiry.</P>
<P>How am I &s;urprized at the incon&s;i&s;tency of the ma|gi; their two principles of good and evil affright me. The Indian who bathes his vi&s;age in urine, and calls it piety, &s;trikes me with a&s;toni&s;hment. The chri&s;tian who believes in three gods is highly ab&s;urd. The Jews who pretend that deity is plea&s;ed with the effu&s;ion of blood, are not le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing.

<P>Surely all men are blind and ignorant of truth. Man|kind wanders, unknowing his way from morning till the evening.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>YET while I &s;ometimes lament the cau&s;e of humanity, and the depravity of human nature, there now and then appear gleams of greatne&s;s that &s;erve to relieve the eye oppre&s;&s;ed with the hideous pro&s;pect, and re&s;emble tho&s;e cultivated &s;pots that are &s;ometimes found in the mid&s;t of an A&s;iatic wilderne&s;s. I &s;ee many &s;uperior excellencies among the Engli&s;h, which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide: I &s;ee virtues, which in other countries are known only to a few, practi&s;ed here by every rank of people.</P>
<P>I know not whether it proceeds from their &s;uperior opulence that the Engli&s;h are more charitable than the re&s;t of mankind; whether by being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the conveniencies of life them&s;elves, they have more lei&s;ure to perceive the unea&s;y &s;ituation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; whatever be the motive, they are not only the mo&s;t charitable of any other nation, but mo&s;t judicious in di&s;tingui&s;hing the propere&s;t objects of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="92">
In other counties the giver is generally influenced by the immediate impul&s;e of pity; his genero&s;ity is exerted as much to relieve his own unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, as to comfort the object in di&s;tre&s;s: in England bene|factions are of a more general nature; &s;ome men of fortune and univer&s;al benevolence propo&s;e the proper objects; the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canva&s;&s;ed by the people; neither pa&s;&s;ion nor pity find a place in the cool di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and charity is then only exerted when it has received the approbation of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>A late in&s;tance of this finely directed benevolence forces it&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly on my imagination, that it in a manner reconciles me to plea&s;ure, and once more makes me the univer&s;al friend of man.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h and French have not only political rea&s;ons to induce them to mutual hatred but often the more prevailing motive of private intere&s;t to widen the breach; a war between other countries is carried on collectively, army fights again&s;t army, and a man's own private re&s;entment is lo&s;t in that of the community; but in England and France the individuals of each country plunder each other at &s;ea without re|dre&s;s, and con&s;equently feel that animo&s;ity again&s;t each other which pa&s;&s;engers do at a robber. They have for &s;ome time carried on an expen&s;ive war; and &s;everal captives have been taken on both &s;ides. Tho&s;e made pri&s;oners by the French have been u&s;ed with cruelty, and guarded with unnece&s;&s;ary caution. Tho&s;e taken by the Engli&s;h, being much more numerous, were confined in the ordinary manner; and, not being relea&s;ed by their countrymen, began to feel all the
<PB N="94" REF="93">
inconveniencies which ari&s;e from want of covering and long confinement.</P>
<P>Their countrymen were informed of their deplorable &s;ituation; but they, more intent on annoying their enemies than relieving their friends, refu&s;ed the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Engli&s;h now &s;aw thou&s;ands of their fellow creatures &s;tarving in every pri&s;on, for&s;aken by tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to protect them, labouring with di&s;ea&s;e, and without cloaths to keep off the &s;eve|rity of the &s;ea&s;on. National benevolence prevailed over national animo&s;ity: Their pri&s;oners were indeed enemies, but they were enemies in di&s;tre&s;s; they cea&s;ed to be hateful, when they no longer continued to be formidable: forgetting therefore their national hatred, the men who were brave enough to conquer, were generous enough to forgive: and they, whom all the world &s;eemed to have di&s;claimed, at la&s;t found pity and redre&s;s from tho&s;e they attempted to &s;ubdue. A &s;ub&s;cription was opened, ample charities collected, proper nece&s;&s;aries procured, and the poor gay &s;ons of a merry nation were once more taught to re&s;ume their former gaiety.</P>
<P>When I ca&s;t my eye over the li&s;t of tho&s;e who con|tributed on this occa&s;ion, I find the names almo&s;t entirely Engli&s;h, &s;carce one foreigner appears a mong the number. It was for Engli&s;hmen alone to be capable of &s;uch exalted virtue. I own, I cannot look over this catalogue of good men and philo&s;ophers without thinking better of my&s;elf, becau&s;e it makes me enter|tain a more favourable opinion of mankind: I am particularly &s;truck with one who writes the&s;e words upon the paper that enclo&s;ed his benefaction. <HI>The</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="94">
<HI>mite of an Engli&s;hman, a citizen of the world, to Frenchmen, pri&s;oners of war, and naked.</HI> I only wi&s;h that he may find as much plea&s;ure from his virtues, as I have done in reflecting upon them, that alone will amply reward him. Such a one, my friend, is an honour to human nature; he makes no private di&s;tinctions of party; all that are &s;tampt with the divine image of their creator are friends to him; he is a <HI>native of the world;</HI> and the emperor of China may be proud that he has &s;uch a countryman.</P>
<P>To rejoice at the de&s;truction of our enemies, is a foible ingrafted upon human nature, and we mu&s;t be permitted to indulge it: the true way of atoning for &s;uch an ill founded plea&s;ure, is thus to turn our triumph into an act of benevolence, and to te&s;tify our own joy by endeavouring to bani&s;h anxiety from others.</P>
<P>Hamti, the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t emperor that ever filled the throne, after having gained three &s;ignal victories over the Tartars, who had invaded his dominions, re|turned to Nankin in order to enjoy the glory of his conque&s;t. After he had re&s;ted for &s;ome days, the people who are naturally fond of proce&s;&s;ions, impa|tiently expected the triumphal entry, which emperors upon &s;uch occa&s;ions were accu&s;tomed to make. Their murmurs came to the emperor's ear. He loved his people, and was willing to do all in his power to &s;atisfy their ju&s;t de&s;ires. He therefore a&s;&s;ured them, that he intended, upon the next fea&s;t of the Lanthorns, to exhibit one of the mo&s;t glorious triumphs that had ever been &s;een in China.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="95">
The people were in raptures at his conde&s;cen&s;ion; and, on the appointed day, a&s;&s;embled at the gates of the palace with the mo&s;t eager expectations. Here they waited for &s;ome time without &s;eeing any of tho&s;e preparations which u&s;ually precede a pageant. The lanthorn, with ten thou&s;and tapers, was not yet brought forth; the fire-works, which u&s;ually covered the city walls, were not yet lighted; the people once more began to murmur at this delay; when in the mid&s;t of their impatience, the palace gates flew open, and the emperor him&s;elf appeared, not in &s;plendor or magni|ficence, but in an ordinary habit, followed by the blind, the maimed, and the &s;trangers of the city, all in new cloaths, and each carrying in his hand money enough to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities for the year. The people were at fir&s;t amazed, but &s;oon perceived the wi&s;dom of their king, who taught them, that to make one man happy was more truly great than having ten thou&s;and captives groaning at the wheels of his chariot.</P>

<P>WHatever may be the merits of the Engli&s;h in other &s;ciences, they &s;eem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing. There is &s;carcely a di&s;order in|cident to humanity, again&s;t which they are not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with a mo&s;t infallible antidote. The profe&s;&s;ors of other arts confe&s;s the inevitable intricacy of things; talk with doubt, and decide with he&s;itation; but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine; the adver|ti&s;ing
<PB N="97" REF="96">
profe&s;&s;ors here delight in ca&s;es of difficulty; be the di&s;order never &s;o de&s;perate or radical, you will find numbers in every &s;treet, who, by levelling a pill at the part affected, promi&s;e a certain cure without lo&s;s of time, knowledge of a bedfellow, or hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the a&s;&s;iduity of this profe&s;&s;ion, their benevolence amazes me. They not only in ge|neral give their medicines for half value, but u&s;e the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive remon&s;trances to induce the &s;ick to come and be cured. Sure there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trangely ob&s;tinate in an Engli&s;h patient, who refu&s;es &s;o much health upon &s;uch ea&s;y terms; does he take a pride in being bloated with a drop&s;y? Does he find plea&s;ure in the alternations of an intermittent fever? Or feel as much &s;atisfaction in nur&s;ing up his gout, as he found plea&s;ure in acquiring it? He mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e he would never reject &s;uch repeated a&s;&s;urances of in&s;tant relief. What can be more convincing than the manner in which the &s;ick are invited to be well? The doctor fir&s;t begs the mo&s;t earne&s;t attention of the public to what he is going to propo&s;e; he &s;olemnly affirms the pill was never found to want &s;ucce&s;s; he produces a li&s;t of tho&s;e who have been re&s;cued from the grave by taking it. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, there are many here who now and then think proper to be &s;ick; only &s;ick did I &s;ay? There are &s;ome who even think proper to die! Yes, by the head of Confucius they die; though they might have pur|cha&s;ed the health-re&s;toring &s;pecific for half a crown at every corner.</P>
<P>I am amazed, my dear Fum Hoam, that the&s;e doctors who know what an ob&s;tinate &s;et of people
<PB N="98" REF="97">
they have to deal with, have never thought of at|tempting to revive the dead. When the living are found to reject their pre&s;criptions, they ought in con|&s;cience to apply to the dead, from whom they can expect no &s;uch mortifying repul&s;es; they would find in the dead the mo&s;t complying patients imaginable; and what gratitude might they not expect from the patient's &s;on, now no longer an heir, and his wife now no longer a widow.</P>
<P>Think not, my friend, that there is any thing chimerical in &s;uch an attempt; they already perform cures equally &s;trange: What can be more truly a&s;toni&s;hing than to &s;ee old age re&s;tored to youth, and vigour to the mo&s;t feeble con&s;titutions; yet this is per|formed here every day; a &s;imple electuary effects the&s;e wonders, even without the bungling ceremonies of having the patient boiled up in a kettle, or ground down in a mill.</P>
<P>Few phy&s;icians here go through the ordinary cour&s;es of education, but receive all their knowledge of medi|cine by immediate in&s;piration from heaven. Some are thus in&s;pired even in the womb; and what is very remarkable, under&s;tand their profe&s;&s;ion as well at three years old as at three&s;core. Others have &s;pent a great part of their lives uncon&s;cious of any latent excellence, 'til a bankruptcy, or a re&s;idence in goal, have called their miraculous powers into exertion. And others &s;till there are indebted to their &s;uperlative ignorance alone for &s;ucce&s;s. The more ignorant the practitioner, the le&s;s capable is he thought of deceiving. The people here judge, as they do in the ea&s;t; where it is thought ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite that a man &s;hould be an
<PB N="99" REF="98">
ideot before he pretend to be either a conjurer or a doctor.</P>
<P>When a phy&s;ician by in&s;piration is &s;ent for, he never perplexes the patient by previous examination; he a&s;ks very few que&s;tions, and tho&s;e only for form &s;ake. He knows every di&s;order by intuition. He admini&s;ters the pill or drop for every di&s;temper; nor is more inqui|&s;itive than the farrier while he drenches an hor&s;e. If the patient lives, then has he one more to add to the &s;urviving li&s;t; if he dies, then it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the patient's di&s;order, <HI>that as it was not cured, the di&s;order was incurable.</HI></P>

<P>I WAS &s;ome days ago in company with a politician, who very pathetically declaimed upon the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of his country: he a&s;&s;ured me, that the whole political machine was moving in a wrong track, and that &s;carce ever abilities like his own could ever &s;et it right again. "What have we, &s;aid he, to do with the wars on the continent; we are a commercial nation; we have only to cultivate commerce like our neighbours the Dutch; it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to encrea&s;e trade by &s;ettling new colonies: riches are the &s;trength of a nation; and for the re&s;t, our &s;hips, our &s;hips alone will protect us."

becau&s;e I rea&s;oned without prejudice: I there|fore begged leave, in&s;tead of argument, to relate a &s;hort hi&s;tory. He gave me a &s;mile at once of con|de&s;cen&s;ion and contempt, and I proceeded as follows to de&s;cribe, THE RISE AND DECLENSION OF THE KINGDOM OF LAO.</P>
<P>Northward of China, and in one of the doublings of the great wall, the fruitful province of Lao enjoyed its liberty and a peculiar government of its own. As the inhabitants were on all &s;ides &s;urrounded by the wall, they feared no &s;udden inva&s;ion from the Tartars; and being each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property, they were zealous in its defence.</P>
<P>The natural con&s;equences of &s;ecurity and affluence in any country is a love of plea&s;ure; when the wants of nature are &s;upplied, we &s;eek after the conveniencies; when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e, we de&s;ire the luxuries of life; and when every luxury is provided, it is then ambition takes up the man, and leaves him &s;till &s;omething to wi&s;h for: the inhabitants of the country from primitive &s;implicity &s;oon began to aim at elegance, and from elegance proceeded to refinement. It was now found ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, for the good of the &s;tate, that the people &s;hould be divided: formerly the &s;ame hand that was employed in tilling the ground, or in dre&s;&s;ing up the manufactures, was al&s;o in time of need a &s;oldier; but the cu&s;tom was now changed; for it was per|ceived, that a man bred up from childhood to the arts either of peace or war, became more eminent by this means in his re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ion. The inhabitants were therefore now di&s;tingui&s;hed into artizans and &s;oldiers; and while tho&s;e improved the luxuries of life, the&s;e watched for the &s;ecurity of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="100">
A country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom has always two &s;orts of enemies to fear: foreign foes who attack its exi&s;tence from without, and internal mi&s;creants who betray its liberties within. The inhabitants of Lao were to guard again&s;t both. A country of artizans were mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve internal liberty; and a nation of &s;oldiers were fitte&s;t to repel a foreign inva&s;ion. Hence naturally aro&s;e a divi&s;ion of opinion between the artizans and the &s;oldiers of the kingdom. The artizans ever complaining, that freedom was threatened by an armed internal force, were for di&s;banding the &s;oldiers, and in&s;i&s;ted that their walls, their walls alone were &s;ufficient to repel the mo&s;t formidable inva&s;ion: the warriors, on the contrary, repre&s;ented the power of the neighbouring kings, the combinations formed again&s;t their &s;tate, and the weakne&s;s of the wall which every earthquake might overturn. While this alter|cation continued, the kingdom might be ju&s;tly &s;aid to enjoy its greate&s;t &s;hare of vigour: every order in the &s;tate, by being watchful over each other, contributed to diffu&s;e happine&s;s equally, and ballanced the &s;tate. The arts of peace flouri&s;hed, nor were tho&s;e of war neglected; the neighbouring powers, who had nothing to apprehend from the ambition of men whom they only &s;aw &s;olicitous not for riches but freedom, were contented to traffick with them: They &s;ent their goods to be manufactured in Lao, and paid a large price for them upon their return.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means this people at length became mode|rately rich, and their opulence naturally invited the invader: a Tartar prince led an immen&s;e army again&s;t them, and they as bravely &s;tood up in their own
<PB N="102" REF="101">
defence; they were &s;till in&s;pired with a love of their country; they fought the barbarous enemy with forti|tude, and gained a complete victory.</P>
<P>From this moment, which they regarded as the completion of their glory, hi&s;torians date their down|fall. They had ri&s;en in &s;trength by a love of their country, and fell by indulging ambition. The country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the invading Tartars, &s;eemed to them a prize that would not only render them more formidable for the future, but which would encrea&s;e their opulence for the pre&s;ent; it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, there|fore, both by &s;oldiers and artizans, that tho&s;e de&s;olate regions &s;hould be peopled by colonies from Lao. When a trading nation begins to act the conqueror, it is then perfectly undone: it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the &s;upport of its neighbours; while they continue to regard it without envy or apprehen&s;ion, trade may flouri&s;h; but when once it pre&s;umes to a&s;&s;ert as its right what it only enjoyed as a favour, each country reclaims that part of commerce which it has power to take back, and turns it into &s;ome other channel more honourable, though perhaps le&s;s convenient.</P>
<P>Every neighbour now began to regard with jealous eyes this ambitious common-wealth, and forbade their &s;ubjects any future intercour&s;e with them. The inhabitants of Lao, however, &s;till pur&s;ued the &s;ame ambitious maxims; it was from their colonies alone they expected riches; and riches, &s;aid they, are &s;trength, and &s;trength is &s;ecurity. Numberle&s;s were the migrations of the de&s;perate and enterprizing of this country to people the de&s;olate dominions lately
<PB N="103" REF="102">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Tartar; between the&s;e colonies and the mother country, a very advantageous traffic was at fir&s;t carried on, the republic &s;ent their colonies large quantities of the manufactures of the country, and they in return provided the republic with an equivalent in ivory and gin&s;eng. By this means the inhabitants became immen&s;ely rich, and this produced an equal degree of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; for men who have much money will always find &s;ome fanta&s;tical modes of enjoyment. How &s;hall I mark the &s;teps by which they declined! Every colony in proce&s;s of time &s;preads over the whole country where it fir&s;t was planted. As it grows more populous, it becomes more polite; and tho&s;e manufactures for which it was in the beginning obliged to others, it learns to dre&s;s up it&s;elf: &s;uch was the ca&s;e with the colonies of Lao; they in le&s;s than a century became a powerful and a polite people, and the more polite they grew, the le&s;s advantageous was the commerce which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and others. By this means the mother country being abridged in its commerce grew poorer but not le&s;s luxurious. Their former wealth had introduced luxury; and wherever luxury once fixes, no art can either le&s;&s;en or remove it. Their commerce with their neighbours was totally de&s;troyed; and that with their colonies was every day naturally and nece&s;&s;arily declining; they &s;till, however, pre&s;erved the in&s;olence of wealth, without a power to &s;upport it, and per&s;evered in being luxurious while contemptible from poverty. In &s;hort, the &s;tate re&s;embled one of tho&s;e bodies bloated with di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e bulk is only a &s;ymptom of its wretchedne&s;s. Their former opulence only rendered them more im|potent, as tho&s;e individuals who are reduced from
<PB N="104" REF="103">
riches to poverty, are of all men the mo&s;t unfortunate and helple&s;s. They had imagined, becau&s;e their colonies tended to make them rich upon the fir&s;t acqui&s;ition, they would &s;till continue to do &s;o; they now found however, that on them&s;elves alone they &s;hould have depended for &s;upport; that colonies ever afford but temporary affluence, and when cultivated and polite are no longer u&s;eful. From &s;uch a concurrence of circum|&s;tances they &s;oon became contemptible. The emperor Honti invaded them with a powerful army. Hi&s;torians do not &s;ay whether their colonies were too remote to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e were de&s;irous of &s;haking off their dependance: But certain it is, they &s;carce made any re&s;i&s;tance; their walls were now found but a weak defence; and they at length were obliged to acknow|ledge &s;ubjection to the empire of China.</P>
<P>Happy, very happy might they have been, had they known when to bound their riches and their glory. Had they known that extending empire is often dimini&s;hing power, that countries are ever &s;tronge&s;t which are inter|nally powerful; that colonies by draining away the brave and enterprizing, leave the country in the hands of the timid and the avaritious; that walls give little protection, unle&s;s manned with re&s;olu|tion; that too much commerce may injure a nation as well as too little; and that there is a wide dif|ference between a conquering and a flouri&s;hing empire.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THO' fond of many acquaintances, I de&s;ire an intimacy only with a few. The man in black whom I have often mentioned, is one who&s;e friend&s;hip I cou'd wi&s;h to acquire, becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my e&s;teem. His manners it is true, are tinctured with &s;ome &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tencies; and he may be ju&s;tly termed an hu|mouri&s;t in a nation of humouri&s;ts. Tho' he is gene|rous even to profu&s;ion, he affects to be thought a pro|digy of par&s;imony and prudence; though his conver|&s;ation be replete with the mo&s;t &s;ordid and &s;elfi&s;h maxims, his heart is dilated with the mo&s;t unbounded love. I have known him profe&s;s him&s;elf a man-hater, while his cheek was glowing with compa&s;&s;ion; and while his looks were &s;oftened into pity, I have heard him u&s;e the language of the mo&s;t unbounded ill nature. Some affect humanity and tenderne&s;s, others boa&s;t of having &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions from nature; but he is the only man I ever knew who &s;eemed a&s;hamed of his natural benevolence. He takes as much pains to hide his feelings as any hypocrite would to conceal his indifference; but on every unguarded moment the ma&s;k drops off, and reveals him to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>In one of our late excur&s;ions into the country, hap|pening to di&s;cour&s;e upon the provi&s;ion that was made for the poor in England, he &s;eemed amazed how any of his countrymen could be &s;o fooli&s;hly weak as to relieve occa&s;ional objects of charity, when the laws had made &s;uch ample provi&s;ion for their &s;upport. In every
<PB N="106" REF="105">
pari&s;h hou&s;e, &s;ays he, the poor are &s;upplied with food, cloaths, fire, and a bed to lie on; they want no more, I de&s;ire no more my&s;elf; yet &s;till they &s;eem di&s;contented. I'm &s;urprized at the inactivity of our magi&s;trates, in not taking up &s;uch vagrants who are only a weight upon the indu&s;trious; I'm &s;urprized that the people are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to relieve them, when they mu&s;t be at the &s;ame time &s;en&s;ible, that it in &s;ome mea&s;ure encourages, idle|ne&s;s, extravagance, and impo&s;ture. Were I to advi&s;e any man for whom I had the lea&s;t regard, I would caution him by all means not to be impo&s;ed upon by their fal&s;e pretences: let me a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, they are impo&s;tors, every one of them; and rather merit a pri&s;on than relief.</P>
<P>He was procceeding in this &s;train earne&s;tly, to di&s;|&s;uade me from an imprudence of which I am &s;eldom guilty; when an old man who &s;till had about him the remnants of tattered finery, implored our compa&s;&s;ion. He a&s;&s;ured us that he was no common beggar, but forced into the &s;hameful profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;upport a dying wife and five hungry children. Being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;uch fal&s;hoods, his &s;tory had not the lea&s;t in|fluence upon me; but it was quite otherwi&s;e with the man in black; I could &s;ee it vi&s;ibly operate upon his countenance, and effectually interrupt his harangue. I could ea&s;ily perceive that his heart burned to relieve the five &s;tarving children, but he &s;eemed a&s;hamed to di&s;cover his weakne&s;s to me. While he thus he&s;itated between compa&s;&s;ion and pride, I pretended to look another way, and he &s;eized this opportunity of giving the poor petitioner a piece of &s;ilver, bidding him at the &s;ame time, in order that I &s;hould hear, go work for his
<PB N="107" REF="106">
bread, and not teize pa&s;&s;engers with &s;uch impertinent fal&s;ehoods for the future.</P>
<P>As he had fancied him&s;elf quite unperceived, he continued, as we proceeded, to rail again&s;t beggars with as much animo&s;ity as before; he threw in &s;ome epi&s;odes on his own amazing prudence and oeconomy, with his profound &s;kill in di&s;covering impo&s;tors, he explained the manner in which he would deal with beggars were he a magi&s;trate, hinted at enlarging &s;ome of the pri&s;ons for their reception, and told two &s;tories of ladies that were robbed by beggarmen. He was be|ginning a third to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, when a &s;ailor with a wooden leg once more cro&s;&s;ed our walks, de&s;iring our pity, and ble&s;&s;ing our limbs. I was for going on without taking any notice, but my friend looking wi&s;h|fully upon the poor petitioner, bid me &s;top, and he would &s;hew me with how much ea&s;e he could at any time detect an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>He now therefore a&s;&s;umed a look of importance, and in an angry tone began to examine the &s;ailor, demanding in what engagement he was thus di&s;abled and rendered unfit for &s;ervice. The &s;ailor replied in a tone as angrily as he, that he had been an officer on board a private &s;hip of war, and that he had lo&s;t his leg abroad in defence of tho&s;e who did nothing at home. At this reply, all my friend's importance vani&s;hed in a moment; he had not a &s;ingle que&s;tion more to a&s;k; he now only &s;tudied what method he &s;hould take to relieve him unob&s;erved. He had however no ea&s;y part to act, as he was obliged to pre&s;erve the appearance of ill nature before me, and yet relieve him&s;elf by relieving the &s;ailor. Ca&s;ting therefore a furious look upon &s;ome
<PB N="108" REF="107">
bundles of chips which the fellow carried in a &s;tring at his back, my friend demanded how he &s;old his matches; but not waiting for a reply, de&s;ired, in a &s;urly tone, to have a &s;hilling's worth. The &s;ailor &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed at his demand, but &s;oon recollecting him|&s;elf, and pre&s;enting his whole bundle, Here, ma&s;ter, &s;ays he, take all my cargo, and a ble&s;&s;ing into the bargain.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe with what an air of triumph my friend marched off with his new purcha&s;e, he a&s;&s;ured me that he was firmly of opinion that tho&s;e fellows mu&s;t have &s;tolen their goods, who could thus afford to &s;ell them for half value; he informed me of &s;everal different u&s;es to which tho&s;e chips might be applied; he expatiated largely upon the &s;avings that would re&s;ult from lighting candles with a match in&s;tead of thru&s;ting them into the fire. He averred, that he would as &s;oon have parted with a tooth as his money to tho&s;e vagabonds, unle&s;s for &s;ome valuable con&s;idera|tion. I cannot tell how long this panegyrick upon frugality and matches might have continued, had not his attention been called off by another object more di&s;tre&s;sful than either of the former. A woman in rags, with one child in her arms, and another on her back, was attempting to &s;ing ballads, but with &s;uch a mournful voice that it was difficult to determine whe|ther &s;he was &s;inging or crying. A wretch, who, in the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s &s;till aimed at good humour, was an object my friend was by no means capable of with|&s;tanding: his vivacity, and his di&s;cour&s;e were in&s;tantly interrupted; upon this occa&s;ion his very di&s;&s;imulation had for&s;aken him. Even, in my pre&s;ence, he imme|diately applied his hands to his pockets, in order to re|lieve
<PB N="109" REF="108">
her: but gue&s;s his confu&s;ion, when he found he had already given away all the money he carried about him to former objects. The mi&s;ery painted in the woman's vi&s;age, was not half &s;o &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed as the agony in his. He continued to &s;earch for &s;ome time, but to no purpo&s;e, till, at length, recollecting him&s;elf, with a face of ineffable good nature, as he had no money, he put into her hands his &s;hillings worth of matches.</P>

<P>AS there appeared &s;omething reluctantly good in the character of my companion, I mu&s;t own it &s;urprized me what could be his motives for thus con|cealing virtues which others take &s;uch pains to di&s;play. I was unable to repre&s;s my de&s;ire of knowing the hi&s;|tory of a man who thus &s;eemed to act under continual re&s;traint, and who&s;e benevolence was rather the effect of appetite than rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was not however till after repeated &s;olicitations he thought proper to gratify my curio&s;ity. "If you are fond, &s;ays he, of hearing <HI>hair breadth'&s;capes,</HI> my hi&s;tory mu&s;t certainly plea&s;e; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of &s;tarving, with|out ever being &s;tarved."</P>
<P>"My father, the younger &s;on of a good family, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall living in the church. His edu|cation was above his fortune, and his genero&s;ity
<PB N="110" REF="109">
greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers &s;till poorer than him&s;elf; for every din|ner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in prai&s;e; and this was all he wanted; the &s;ame am|bition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army, influenced my father at the head of his table: he told the &s;tory of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he repeated the je&s;t of the two &s;cholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the &s;tory of Taffy in the &s;edan chair was &s;ure to &s;et the table in a roar; thus his plea&s;ure encrea&s;ed; in proportion to the plea&s;ure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him."</P>
<P>"As his fortune was but &s;mall, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of leaving his children money, for that was dro&s;s; he was re|&s;olved they &s;hould have learning; for learning, he u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, was better than &s;ilver or gold. For this purpo&s;e he undertook to in&s;truct us him&s;elf; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to im|prove our under&s;tanding. We were told that uni|ver&s;al benevolence was what fir&s;t cemented &s;ociety; we were taught to con&s;ider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <HI>human face divine</HI> with affection and e&s;teem; he wound us up to be mere ma|chines of pity, and rendered us incapable of with|&s;tanding the &s;lighte&s;t impul&s;e made either by real or fictitious di&s;tre&s;s; in a word, we were perfectly in|&s;tructed in the art of <HI>giving away</HI> thou&s;ands, be|fore we were taught the more nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions of <HI>getting</HI> a farthing."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">
"I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his le&s;&s;ons out of all my &s;u&s;picion, and dive&s;ted of even all the little cunning which nature had given me, I re&s;embled, upon my fir&s;t entrance into the bu&s;y and in&s;idious world, one of tho&s;e gladiators who were ex|po&s;ed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome. My father, however, who had only &s;een the world on one &s;ide, &s;eemed to triumph in my &s;uperior di&s;|cernment; though my whole &s;tock of wi&s;dom con|&s;i&s;ted in being able to talk like him&s;elf upon &s;ubjects that once were u&s;eful, becau&s;e they were then topics of the bu&s;y world; but that now were utterly u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e connected with the bu&s;y world no longer."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t opportunity he had of finding his ex|pectations di&s;appointed, was at the very middling figure I made in the univer&s;ity: he had flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee me ri&s;ing into the foremo&s;t rank in literary reputation, but was mor|tified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His di&s;appointment might have been partly a&s;cribed to his having over-rated my talents, and partly to my di&s;like of mathematical rea&s;onings at a time, when my imagination and memory yet un&s;atisfied, were more eager after new objects, than de&s;irous of rea&s;oning upon tho&s;e I knew. This did not, however, plea&s;e my tutors, who ob&s;erved, indeed, that I was a little dull; but at the &s;ame time allowed that I &s;eemed to be <HI>very good natured,</HI> and had no harm in me."</P>
<P>"After I had re&s;ided at college &s;even years, my father died, and left me&mdash;his ble&s;&s;ing. Thus &s;hoved
<PB N="112" REF="111">
from &s;hore without ill nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper &s;tores to &s;ub&s;i&s;t me in &s;o dan|gerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-one. But in order to &s;ettle in life, my friends <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> (for they always advi&s;e when they begin to de&s;pi&s;e us) they advi&s;ed me, I &s;ay, to go into orders."</P>
<P>"To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a &s;hort one, or a black coat when I generally dre&s;&s;ed in brown, I thought was &s;uch a re&s;traint upon my liberty, that I ab&s;olutely rejected the propo&s;al. A prie&s;t in England is not the &s;ame mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that fa&s;ts be&s;t, but eats be&s;t, is reckoned the be&s;t liver; yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence and ea&s;e, from no other con&s;ideration but that boyi&s;h one of dre&s;s. So that my friends were now perfectly &s;atisfied I was undone, and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the lea&s;t harm in him, and was &s;o very good natured."</P>
<P>"Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At fir&s;t I was &s;urpri&s;ed, that the &s;ituation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought di&s;agreeable; there was no great trouble in li&s;tening attentively when his lord&s;hip &s;poke, and laughing when he looked round for applau&s;e. This even good man|ners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too &s;oon, that his lord&s;hip was a greater dunce than my&s;elf; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at &s;etting him right than at receiving his ab|&s;urdities
<PB N="113" REF="112">
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: to flatter tho&s;e we do not know is an ea&s;y ta&s;k; but to flatter our inti|mate acquaintances, all who&s;e foibles are &s;trongly in our eye, is drudgery in&s;upportable. Every time I now opened my lips in prai&s;e, my fal&s;hood went to my con&s;cience; his lord&s;hip &s;oon perceived me to be unfit for &s;ervice; I was therefore di&s;charged; my patron at the &s;ame time being graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that he believed I was tolerably good|natured and had not the lea&s;t harm in me."</P>
<P>"Di&s;appointed in ambition I had recour&s;e to love. A young lady who lived with her aunt, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very pretty fortune, in her own di&s;po|&s;al, had given me, as I fancied, &s;ome rea&s;ons to ex|pect &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;ymptoms by which I was guided were &s;triking; &s;he had always laughed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; &s;he always ob&s;erved, that a man of &s;en&s;e would make a better hu&s;band than a fool, and I as con&s;tantly applied the ob&s;ervation in my own favour. She continually talked in my com|pany of friend&s;hip and the beauties of the mind, and &s;poke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd &s;hoes with dete&s;tation. The&s;e were circum&s;tances which I thought &s;trongly in my favour; &s;o after re&s;olving and re-re&s;olving, I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Mi&s;s heard my propo&s;al with &s;erenity, &s;eeming at the &s;ame time to &s;tudy the figures of her fan. Out at la&s;t it came. There was but one &s;mall objection to complete our happine&s;s, which was no more than&mdash;that &s;he was married three months be|fore to Mr. Shrimp with high-heeled &s;hoes! By way of con&s;olation however &s;he ob&s;erved, that tho'
<PB N="114" REF="113">
I was di&s;appointed in her, my addre&s;&s;es to her aunt would probably kindle her into &s;en&s;ibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good na|tured, and not to have the lea&s;t &s;hare of harm in me."</P>
<P>"Yet &s;till I had friends, numerous friends, and to them I was re&s;olved to apply. O friend&s;hip! thou fond &s;oother of the human brea&s;t, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched &s;eek for &s;uc|cour; on thee the care tired &s;on of mi&s;ery fondly re|lies; from thy kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance the unfortunate al|ways hopes relief, and may be ever &s;ure of&mdash;di&s;|appointment! my fir&s;t application was to a city &s;crivener, who had frequently offered to lend me money when he knew I did not want it. I informed him that now was the time to put his friend&s;hip to the te&s;t; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occa&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed I never wanted it more, returned I. I am &s;orry for that, cries the &s;crivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay."</P>
<P>"From him I flew with indignation to one of the be&s;t friends I had in the world, and made the &s;ame reque&s;t. Indeed, Mr. Drybone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, &s;ir, I would not advi&s;e you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highe&s;t degree, and &s;ome of your acquaintance always thought you a very &s;illy fellow; let me &s;ee, you want two
<PB N="115" REF="114">
hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, &s;ir, exactly? To confe&s;s a truth, returned I, I &s;hall want three hundred; but then I have another friend from whom I can borrow the re&s;t. Why then, replied my friend, if you would take my ad|vice; and you know I &s;hould not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e you but for your own good, I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole &s;um from that other friend; and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know."</P>
<P>"Poverty now began to come fa&s;t upon me, yet in&s;tead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and &s;imple. A friend was arre&s;ted for fifty pounds, I was unable to extricate him except by becoming his bail. When at liberty he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In pri&s;on I expected greater &s;atisfactions than I had enjoyed at large. I hoped to conver&s;e with men in this new world &s;imple and believing like my&s;elf, but I found them as cunning and as cautious as tho&s;e in the world I had left behind. They &s;punged upon my money whil&s;t it la&s;ted, borrowed my coals and never paid them, and cheated me when I played at cribbage. All this was done becau&s;e they believed me to be very good|natured, and knew that I had no harm in me."</P>
<P>"Upon my fir&s;t entrance into this man&s;ion, which is to &s;ome the abode of de&s;pair, I felt no &s;en&s;ations different from the&s;e I experienced abroad. I was now on one &s;ide the door, and tho&s;e who were un|confined were on the other; this was all the dif|ference between us. At fir&s;t indeed I felt &s;ome un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="116" REF="115">
in con&s;idering how I &s;hould be able to pro|vide this week for the wants of the week en&s;uing; but after &s;ome time, if I found my&s;elf &s;ure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be &s;upplied another I &s;eized every precarious meal with the utmo&s;t good humour, indulged no rants of &s;pleen at my &s;ituation, never called down heaven and all the &s;tars to behold me dining upon an half|penny-worth of radi&s;hes; my very companions were taught to believe that I liked &s;allad better than mutton. I contented my&s;elf with thinking, that all my life I &s;hould either eat white bread or brown; con&s;idered that all that happened was be&s;t, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it went, and read Tacitus often, for want of more books and company."</P>
<P>"How long I might have continued in this torpid &s;tate of &s;implicity I cannot tell, had I not been rouzed by &s;eeing an old acquaintance, whom I knew to be a prudent blockhead preferred to a place in the go|vernment. I now found that I had pur&s;ued a wrong track, and that the true way of being able to relieve others, was fir&s;t to aim at independence my&s;elf. My immediate care, therefore, was to leave my pre|&s;ent habitation, and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, unde&s;igning deportment, I put on that of clo&s;ene&s;s, prudence and oeconomy. One of the mo&s;t heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I &s;hall prai&s;e my&s;elf as long as I live, was the refu&s;ing half a crown to an old acquaintance, at the time when he wanted
<PB N="117" REF="116">
it, and I had it to &s;pare; for this alone I de&s;erve to be decreed an ovation."</P>
<P>"I now therefore pur&s;ued a cour&s;e of uninterrupted frugality, &s;eldom wanted a dinner, and was con&s;e|quently invited to twenty. I &s;oon began to get the character of a &s;aving hunks that had money; and in&s;en&s;ibly grew into e&s;teem. Neighbours have a&s;k'd my advice in the di&s;po&s;al of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have con|tracted a friend&s;hip with an alderman, only by ob|&s;erving, that if we take a farthing from a thou&s;and pound it will be a thou&s;and pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table by pretend|ing to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of marriage with a rich widow, for only having ob&s;erved that the bread was ri&s;ing. If ever I am a&s;ked a que&s;tion whether I know it or not, in&s;tead of an&s;wering, I only &s;mile and look wi&s;e. If a charity is propo&s;ed, I go about with the hat, but put no|thing in my&s;elf. If a wretch &s;olicits my pity, I ob|&s;erve that the world is filled with impo&s;tors, and take a certain method of not being deceived by never relieving. In &s;hort, I now find the true&s;t way of finding e&s;teem even from the indigent, is <HI>to give away nothing, and thus have much in our power to give.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>LATELY in company with my friend in black, who&s;e conver&s;ation is now both my amu&s;ement and in&s;truction, I could not avoid ob&s;erving the great numbers of old bachelors and maiden ladies with which this city &s;eems to be over-run. Sure marriage, &s;aid I, is not &s;ufficiently encouraged, or we &s;hould never be|hold &s;uch crowds of battered beaux and decayed co|quets &s;till attempting to drive a trade they have been &s;o long unfit for, and &s;warming upon the gaiety of the age. I behold an old bachelor in the mo&s;t contemp|tible light, as an animal that lives upon the common &s;tock without contributing his &s;hare: he is a bea&s;t of prey, and the laws &s;hould make u&s;e of as many &s;trata|gems and as much force to drive the reluctant &s;avage into the toils, as the Indians when they hunt the hyena or the rhinoceros. The mob &s;hould be permitted to halloo after him, boys might play tricks on him with impunity, every well-bred company &s;hould laugh at him, and if, when turned of &s;ixty, he offered to make love, his mi&s;tre&s;s might &s;pit in his face, or what would be perhaps a greater puni&s;hment, &s;hould fairly grant him the favour.</P>
<P>As for old maids, continued I, they &s;hould not be treated with &s;o much &s;everity, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e none would be &s;o if they could. No lady in her &s;en&s;es would chu&s;e to make a &s;ubordinate figure at chri&s;ten|ings and lyings-in, when &s;he might be the principal her|&s;elf; nor curry favour with a &s;i&s;ter-in-law, when &s;he
<PB N="119" REF="118">
might command an hu&s;band, nor toil in preparing cu&s;|tards when &s;he might lie a bed and give directions how they ought to be made, nor &s;tifle all her &s;en&s;ations in de|mure formality, when &s;he might with matrimonial free|dom &s;hake her acquaintance by the hand, and wink at a double entendre. No lady could be &s;o very &s;illy as to live &s;ingle, if &s;he could help it. I con&s;ider an unmarried lady declining into the vale of years, as one of tho&s;e charming countries bordering on China that lies wa&s;te for want of proper inhabitants We are not to accu&s;e the country, but the ignorance of its neighbours, who are in&s;en&s;ible of its beauties, though at liberty to enter and cultivate the &s;oil.</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir, replied my companion, you are very little acquainted with the Engli&s;h ladies to think they are old maids again&s;t their will. I dare venture to affirm that you can hardly &s;elect one of them all, but has had frequent offers of marriage, which, either pride or avarice has not made her reject. In&s;tead of thinking it a di&s;grace, they take every occa&s;ion to boa&s;t of their former cruelty; a &s;oldier does not exult more when he counts over the wounds he has received, than a female veteran when &s;he re|lates the wounds &s;he has formerly given: exhau&s;tle&s;s when &s;he begins a narrative of the former death|dealing power of her eyes. She tells of the knight in gold lace who died with a &s;ingle frown, and never ro&s;e again till&mdash;he was married to his maid: Of the &s;quire who being cruelly denied fell in a rage, flew to the window, and lifting up the &s;a&s;h, threw him|&s;elf in an agony&mdash;into his arm chair: Of the par&s;on, who cro&s;&s;ed in love, re&s;olutely &s;wallowed opium,
<PB N="120" REF="119">
which bani&s;hed the &s;tings of de&s;pi&s;ed love by&mdash;mak|ing him &s;leep. In &s;hort, &s;he talks over her former lo&s;&s;es with plea&s;ure, and, like &s;ome trade&s;men, finds con&s;olation in the many bankruptcies &s;he has &s;uffer|ed."</P>
<P>"For this rea&s;on, whenever I &s;ee a &s;uperannuated beauty
&s;till unmarried, I tacitly accu&s;e her either of pride, avarice, coquetry,
or affectation. There's Mi&s;s Jenny Tinderbox, I once remember her to have had
&s;ome beauty, and a moderate fortune. Her elder &s;i&s;ter happened to marry a
man of quality, and this &s;eemed as a &s;tatute of virginity again&s;t poor
Jane. Becau&s;e there was one lucky hit in the family, &s;he was re&s;olved not
to di&s;grace it by introducing a trade&s;man; by thus rejecting her equals,
and ne|glected or de&s;pi&s;ed by her &s;uperiors, &s;he now acts in the
capacity of tutore&s;s to her &s;i&s;ter's children, and undergoes the drudgery
of three &s;ervants without receiving the wages of one."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Squeeze was a pawnbroker's daughter; her father had
early taught her that money was a very good thing, and left her a moderate
fortune at his death. She was &s;o perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the value of what
&s;he had got, that &s;he was re&s;olved never to part with a farthing without
an equality on the part of her &s;uitor; &s;he thus refu&s;ed &s;everal offers
made her by people who wanted to better them&s;elves, as the &s;aying is; and
grew old and ill-natured, with|out ever con&s;idering that &s;he &s;hould have
made an abatement in her preten&s;ions, from her face being pale and marked
with the &s;mall-pox."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="120">"Lady Betty Tempe&s;t on the contrary
had beauty, with fortune and family. But, fond of conque&s;t, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
from triumph to triumph; &s;he had read plays and romances, and there had
learned that a plain man of common &s;en&s;e was no better than a fool; &s;uch
&s;he refu&s;ed, and &s;ighed only for the gay, giddy, incon&s;tant and
thoughtle&s;s; after &s;he had thus rejected hundreds who liked her, and
&s;igh|ed for hundreds who de&s;pi&s;ed her, &s;he found her&s;elf
in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;erted: at pre&s;ent &s;he is company only for her aunts and
cou&s;ins, and &s;ometimes makes one in a country-dance, with only one of the
chairs for a partner, ca&s;ts off round a joint-&s;tool, and &s;ets to a corner
cupboard. In a word, &s;he is treated with civil contempt from every quarter,
and placed, like a piece of old fa&s;hioned lumber, merely to fill up a
corner."</P>
<P>"But Sophronia, the &s;agacious Sophronia; how &s;hall I mention her?
She was taught to love Greek, and hate the men from her very infancy: &s;he has
rejected fine gentlemen, becau&s;e they were not pe|dants, and pedants
becau&s;e they were not fine gentle|men; her exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility has
taught her to di&s;cover every fault in every lover, and her inflexible
ju&s;tice has prevented her pardoning them; thus &s;he rejected &s;everal
offers, till the wrinkles of age had overtaken her; and now, without one good
feature in her face, &s;he talks ince&s;&s;antly of the beauties of the
mind."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>WERE we to e&s;timate the learning of the Engli&s;h by the number of books that are every day publi&s;hed among them, perhaps no country, not even China it&s;elf, could equal them in this particular. I have reckoned not le&s;s than twenty-three new books publi&s;hed in one day; which upon computation, makes eight thou&s;and three hundred and ninety-five in one year. Mo&s;t of the&s;e are not confined to one &s;ingle &s;cience, but embrace the whole circle. Hi&s;tory, po|liticks, poetry, mathematics, metaphy&s;ics, and the philo&s;ophy of nature are all comprized in a manual not larger than that in which our children are taught the letters. If then we &s;uppo&s;e the learned of England to read but an eighth part of the works which daily come from the pre&s;s (and &s;ure none can pretend to learning upon le&s;s ea&s;y terms) at this rate every &s;cholar will read a thou&s;and books in one year. From &s;uch a calculation you may conjecture what an amazing fund of literature a man mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, who thus reads three new books every day, not one of which but contains all the good things that ever were &s;aid or written.</P>
<P>And yet I know not how it happens, but the En|gli&s;h are not in reality &s;o learned as would &s;eem from this calculation. We meet but few who know all arts and &s;ciences to perfection; whether it is that the ge|nerality are incapable of &s;uch exten&s;ive knowledge, or that the authors of tho&s;e books are not adequate in|&s;tructors.
<PB N="123" REF="122">
In China, the emperor him&s;elf takes cog|ni&s;ance of all the doctors in the kingdom who profe&s;s author&s;hip. In England, every man may be an author that can write; for they have by law a liberty not only of &s;aying what they plea&s;e, but of being al&s;o as dull as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday I te&s;tified my &s;urprize to the man in black, where writers could be found in &s;ufficient number to throw off the books I daily &s;aw crowding from the pre&s;s. I at fir&s;t imagined, that their learned &s;eminaries might take this method of in&s;tructing the world. But to obviate this objection, my companion a&s;&s;ured me, that the doctors of colleges never wrote, and that &s;ome of them had actually forgot their reading; but if you de&s;ire, continued he, to &s;ee a collection of authors, I fancy, I can introduce you this evening to a club, which a&s;&s;embles every Saturday at &s;even, at the &s;ign of the Broom near I&s;lington, to talk over the bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t, and the entertainment of the week en&s;uing. I accepted his invitation, we walked together, and en|tered the hou&s;e &s;ome time before the u&s;ual hour for the company a&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>My friend took this opportunity of letting me into the characters of the principal members of the club, not even the ho&s;t excepted, who, it &s;eems, was once an author him&s;elf, but preferred by a book&s;eller to this &s;ituation as a reward for his former &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on, &s;aid he, of our &s;ociety, is doctor Nonentity, a metaphy&s;ician. Mo&s;t people think him a profound &s;cholar; but as he &s;eldom &s;peaks, I cannot be po&s;itive in that particular; he generally &s;preads
<PB N="124" REF="123">
him&s;elf before the fire, &s;ucks his pipe, talks little, drinks much, and is reckoned very good company. I'm told he writes indexes to perfection, he makes e&s;&s;ays on the origin of evil, philo&s;ophical enquiries upon any &s;ubject, and draws up an an&s;wer to any book upon twenty-four hours warning. You may di&s;tin|gui&s;h him from the re&s;t of the company by his long grey wig, and the blue handkerchief round his neck.</P>
<P>The next to him in merit and e&s;teem is Tim Sylla|bub, a drole creature; he &s;ometimes &s;hines as a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude among the choice &s;pirits of the age; he is reckoned equally excellent at a rebus, a riddle, a baudy &s;ong, and an hymn for the tabernacle. You will know him by his &s;habby finery, his powdered wig, dirty &s;hirt, and broken &s;ilk &s;tockings.</P>
<P>After him &s;ucceeds Mr. Tibs, a very <HI>u&s;eful hand;</HI> he writes receipts for the bite of a mad dog, and throws off an ea&s;tern tale to perfection; he under|&s;tands the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of an author as well as any man; for no book&s;eller alive can cheat him; you may di&s;tingui&s;h him by the peculiar clum&s;ine&s;s of his figure and the coar&s;ene&s;s of his coat: however, though it be coar&s;e, (as he frequently tells the company) he has paid for it.</P>
<P>Lawyer Squint is the politician of the &s;ociety; he makes &s;peeches for parliament, writes addre&s;&s;es to his fellow &s;ubjects, and letters to noble commanders; he gives the hi&s;tory of every new play, and finds <HI>&s;ea&s;on|able thoughts</HI> upon every occa&s;ion.&mdash;My companion
<PB N="12" REF="124">
was proceeding in his de&s;cription, when the ho&s;t came running in with terror on his countenance to tell us, that the door was be&s;et with bailiffs. If that be the ca&s;e then, &s;ays my companion, we had as good be going; for I am po&s;itive we &s;hall not &s;ee one of the company this night. Wherefore di&s;appointed we were both obliged to return home, he to enjoy the oddities which compo&s;e his character alone, and I to write as u&s;ual to my friend the occurrences of the day.</P>

<P>BY my la&s;t advices from Mo&s;cow, I find the caravan has not yet departed for China: I &s;till continue to write, expecting that you may receive a large number of my letters at once. In them you will find rather a minute detail of Engli&s;h pecu|liarities, than a general picture of their manners or di&s;|po&s;ition. Happy it were for mankind if all travellers would thus, in&s;tead of characteri&s;ing a people in general terms, lead us into a detail of tho&s;e minute circum&s;tan|ces which fir&s;t influenced their opinion: the genius of a country &s;hould be inve&s;tigated with a kind of experi|mental enquiry: by this means we &s;hould have more preci&s;e and ju&s;t notions of foreign nations, and detect travellers them&s;elves when they happened to form wrong conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="125">
My friend and I repeated our vi&s;it to the club of au|thors; where, upon our entrance, we found the mem|bers all a&s;&s;embled and engaged in a loud debate.</P>
<P>The poet, in &s;habby finery, holding a manu&s;cript in his hand, was earne&s;tly endeavouring to per&s;uade the company to hear him read the fir&s;t book of an heroic poem, which he had compo&s;ed the day before. But again&s;t this, all the members very warmly objected. They knew no rea&s;on why any member of the club &s;hould be indulged with a particular hearing, when many of them had publi&s;hed whole volumes which had never been looked in. They in&s;i&s;ted that the law &s;hould be ob&s;erved, where reading in company was expre&s;ly noticed. It was in vain that the plaintiff pleaded the peculiar merit of his piece; he &s;poke to an a&s;&s;embly in&s;en&s;ible to all his remon&s;trances; the book of laws was opened, and read by the &s;ecretary, where it was expre&s;ly enacted, "That what&s;oever poet, &s;peech-maker, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">itic, or hi&s;torian, &s;hould pre&s;ume to engage the company by reading his own works, he was to lay down &s;ixpence previous to opening the manu&s;cript, and &s;hould be charged one &s;hilling an hour while he continued reading; the &s;aid &s;hilling to be equally di&s;tributed among the company as a recompence for their trouble."</P>
<P>Our poet &s;eemed at fir&s;t to &s;hrink at the penalty, he&s;itating for &s;ome time whether he &s;hould depo&s;it the fine, or &s;hut up the poem; but looking round, and perceiving two &s;trangers in the room, his love of fame out-weighed his prudence, and laying down the &s;um by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, he in&s;i&s;ted on his prerogative.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="126">
A profound &s;ilence en&s;uing, he began by explaining his de&s;ign. "Gentlemen, &s;ays he, the pre&s;ent piece is not one of your common epic poems, which come from the pre&s;s like paper kites in &s;ummer; there are none of your Turnu&s;es or Dido's in it; it is an heroical de&s;crip|tion of nature. I only beg you'll endeavour to make your &s;ouls in uni&s;on with mine, and hear with the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m with which I have written. The poem begins with the de&s;cription of an author's bed-chamber: the picture was &s;ketched in my own apartment; for you mu&s;t know, gentlemen, that I am my&s;elf the heroe. Then putting him&s;elf into the attitude of an orator, with all the empha&s;is of voice and action, he proceeded.</P>
<L>" Where the Red Lion flaring o'er the way,</L>

<L>Where Calvert's butt, and Par&s;on's black champaign,</L>

<L>The mu&s;e found Scroggen &s;tretch'd beneath a rug,</L>
<L>A window patch'd with paper lent a ray,</L>
<L>That dimly &s;hew'd the &s;tate in which he lay;</L>
<L>The &s;anded floor that grits beneath the tread;</L>

<L><PB N="128" REF="127"> A night-cap deck'd his brows in&s;tead of bay,</L>
<L>A cap by night&mdash;a &s;tocking all the day!</L>
<P>With this la&s;t line he &s;eemed &s;o much elated, that he was unable to proceed: "There gentlemen, cries he, there is a de&s;cription for you; Rabelais's bed|chamber is but a fool to it:<Q> 
<L>A cap by night&mdash;a &s;tocking all the day!</L></Q> There is &s;ound and &s;en&s;e, and truth, and nature in the trifling compa&s;s of ten little &s;yllables."</P>
<P>He was too much employed in &s;elf-admiration to ob&s;erve the company: who by nods, winks, &s;hrugs, and &s;tifled laughter, te&s;tified every mark of contempt. He turned &s;everally to each for their opinion, and found all however ready to applaud. One &s;wore it was ini|mitable; another &s;aid it was damn'd fine; and a third cried out in rapture <HI>Cari&s;&s;imo.</HI> At la&s;t addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the pre&s;ident, and pray, Mr. Squint, &s;ays he, let us have your opinion. Mine, an&s;wered the pre&s;ident, (taking the manu&s;cript out of the author's hand's) may this gla&s;s &s;uffocate me, but I think it equal to any thing I have &s;een; and I fancy, (continued he doubling up the poem, and forcing it into the author's pocket, that you will get great honour when it comes out; &s;o I &s;hall beg leave to put it in We will not intrude upon your good-nature, in de&s;iring to hear more of it at pre&s;ent; <HI>ex ungue Herculem,</HI> we are &s;atisfied, perfectly &s;atisfied. The author made two or three attempts to pull it out a &s;econd time, and the pre&s;ident made as many to prevent him.

When this tempe&s;t of poetry and prai&s;e was blown over, one of the company changed the &s;ubject, by wondering how any man could be &s;o dull as to write poetry at pre&s;ent, &s;ince pro&s;e it&s;elf would hardly pay. Would you think it, gentlemen, continued he, I have actually written la&s;t week &s;ixteen prayers, twelve bawdy je&s;ts, and three &s;ermons, all at the rate of &s;ix|pence a-piece; and what is &s;till more extraordinary the book&s;eller has lo&s;t by the bargain. Such &s;ermons would once have gain'd me a prebend's &s;tall; but now alas we have neither piety, ta&s;te, nor humour among us. Po&s;itively if this &s;ea&s;on does not turn out better than it has begun, unle&s;s the mini&s;try commit &s;ome blunders to furni&s;h us with a new topic of abu&s;e, I &s;hall re&s;ume my old bu&s;ine&s;s of working at the pre&s;s, in&s;tead of finding it employment.</P>
<P>The whole club &s;eemed to join in condemning the &s;ea|&s;on, as one of the wor&s;t that had come for &s;ome time; a gentleman particularly ob&s;erved that the nobility were never known to &s;ub&s;cribe wor&s;e than at pre&s;ent. "I know not how it happens, &s;aid he, though I follow them up as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, yet I can hardly get a &s;ingle &s;ub&s;cription in a week. The hou&s;es of the great are as inacce&s;&s;ible as a frontier garri&s;on at mid-night. I never &s;ee a nobleman's door half opened that &s;ome &s;urly porter or footman does not &s;tand full in the breach. I was ye&s;terday to wait with a &s;ub&s;cription propo&s;al upon my lord Squa&s;h the creolian. I had po&s;ted my&s;elf at his door the whole morning, and ju&s;t as he was getting into his coach, thru&s;t my propo&s;al &s;nugg into his hand folded up in the form of a letter from my&s;elf. He ju&s;t glanced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;uper&s;cription, and, not knowing the hand, con&s;igned it to his valet de chambre; this re&s;pectable per&s;onage treated it as his

ma&s;ter, and put it into the hands of the porter. The porter gra&s;ped my propo&s;al frowning; and, mea&s;uring my figure from top to toe, put it back into my own hands unopened.</P>
<P>"To the devil I pitch all the nobility, cries a little man, in a peculiar accent, I am &s;ure they have of late u&s;ed me mo&s;t &s;curvily. You mu&s;t know, gentlemen, &s;ome time ago, upon the arrival of a certain noble duke from his travels, I &s;et my&s;elf down, and vamped up a fine flaunting, poetical panegyric, which I had written in &s;uch a &s;train, that I fancied it would have even wheedled milk from a mou&s;e. In this I repre|&s;ented the whole kingdom welcoming his grace to his native &s;oil, not forgetting the lo&s;s France and Italy would &s;u&s;tain in their arts by his departure. I expected to touch for a bank bill at lea&s;t; &s;o folding up my ver&s;es in gilt paper, I gave my la&s;t half crown to a genteel &s;ervant to be the bearer. My letter was &s;afely con|veyed to his grace, and the &s;ervant after four hours ab&s;ence, during which time I led the life of a fiend, returned with a letter four times as big as mine. Gue&s;s my exta&s;y at the pro&s;pect of &s;o fine a return. I eagerly took the pacquet into my hands, that trembled to receive it. I kept it &s;ome time unopened before me brooding over the expected trea&s;ure it contained; when opening it, as I hope to be &s;aved, gentlemen, his grace had &s;ent me in payment for my poem no Bank bills, but &s;ix copies of ver&s;e, each longer than mine, addre&s;&s;ed to him upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>"A nobleman, cries a member, who had hitherto been &s;ilent, is created as much for the confu&s;ion of us authors as the catch-pole. I'll tell you a &s;tory, gen|tlemen,
<PB N="131" REF="130">
which is as true as that this pipe is made of clay. When I was delivered of my fir&s;t book, I owed my taylor for a &s;uit of cloaths, but that is nothing new, you know, and may be any man's ca&s;e as well as mine. Well, owing him for a &s;uit of cloaths, and hearing that my book took very well, he &s;ent for his money, and in&s;i&s;ted upon being paid immediately: though I was at that time rich in fame, for my book run like wild fire, yet I was very &s;hort in money, and being unable to &s;atisfy his demand, prudently re&s;olved to keep my chamber, preferring a p i&s;on of my own chu&s;ing at home, to one of my taylor's chu&s;ing abroad. In vain the bailiffs u&s;ed all their arts to decoy me from my citadel, in vain they &s;ent to let me know that a gentleman wanted to &s;peak with me at the next tavern, in vain they came with an urgent me&s;&s;age from my aunt in the country; in vain I was told that a particular friend was at the point of death, and de&s;ired to take his la&s;t farewell; I was deaf, in&s;en&s;ible, rock, adamant, the bailiffs could make no impre&s;&s;ion on my hard heart, for I effectually kept my liberty by never &s;tirring out of the room.</P>
<P>"This was very well for a fortnight; when one morning I received a mo&s;t &s;plendid me&s;&s;age from the earl of Doom&s;day, importing, that he had read my book, and was in raptures with every line of it; he impatiently longed to &s;ee the author, and had &s;ome de|&s;igns which might turn out greatly to my advantage. I pau&s;ed upon the contents of this me&s;&s;age, and found there could be no deceit, for the card was gilt at the edges, and the bearer, I was told, had quite the looks of a gentleman. Witne&s;s ye powers, how my heart triumphed at my own importance; I &s;aw a long per|&s;pective

of felicity before me, I applauded the ta&s;te of the times, which never &s;aw genius for&s;aken; I had prepared a &s;et introductory &s;peech for the occa&s;ion, five glaring compliments for his lord&s;hip, and two more mode&s;t for my&s;elf. The next morning, therefore, in order to be punctual to my appointment, I took coach, and ordered the fellow to drive to the &s;treet and hou&s;e mentioned in his lord&s;hip's addre&s;s. I had the pre|caution to pull up the windows as I went along to keep off the bu&s;y part of mankind, and, big with expectation, fancied the coach never went fa&s;t enough. At length, however, the wi&s;h'd for moment of its &s;top|ping arrived, this for &s;ome time I impatiently expected, and letting down the door in a tran&s;port, in order to take a previous view of his lord&s;hip's magnificent palace and &s;ituation, I found&mdash;poi&s;on to my &s;ight! I found my&s;elf, not in an elegant &s;treet, but a paltry lane, not at a nobleman's door, but the door of a &s;punging|hou&s;e; I found the coachman had all this while been driving me to jail, and I &s;aw the bailiff with a devil's face, coming out to &s;ecure me.</P>
<P>To a philo&s;opher, no circum&s;tance, however trifling, is too minute; he finds in&s;truction and entertainment in occurrences, which are pa&s;&s;ed over by the re&s;t of man|kind as low, trite, and indifferent; it is from the num|ber of the&s;e particulars, which, to many, appear in&s;ig|nificant, that he is at la&s;t enabled to form general con|clu&s;ions; this, therefore, mu&s;t be my excu&s;e for &s;end|ing &s;o far as China accounts of manners and follies, which, though minute in their own nature, &s;erve more truly to characteri&s;e this people than hi&s;tories of their public treaties, courts, mini&s;ters, negotiations, and am|ba&s;&s;adors.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h have not yet brought the art of gar|dening to the &s;ame perfection with the Chine&s;e, but have lately begun to imitate them; nature is now followed with greater a&s;&s;iduity than formerly; the trees are &s;uffered to &s;hoot out into the utmo&s;t luxuri|ance; the &s;treams, no longer forced from their native beds, are permitted to wind along the vallies: &s;ponta|neous flowers take place of the fini&s;hed parterre, and the enamelled meadow of the &s;haven green.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till the Engli&s;h are far behind us in this charm|ing art; their de&s;igners have not yet attained a power of uniting in&s;truction with beauty. An European will &s;carcely conceive my meaning, when I &s;ay that there is &s;carce a garden in China which does not contain &s;ome fine moral, couch'd under the general de&s;ign, where one is not taught wi&s;dom as he walks, and feels the force of &s;ome noble truth, or delicate precept re&s;ulting from the di&s;po&s;ition of the groves, &s;treams or grotto's. Permit me to illu&s;trate what I mean by a de|&s;cription of my gardens at Quam&s;i. My heart &s;till hovers round tho&s;e &s;cenes of former happine&s;s with plea&s;ure; and I find &s;atisfaction in enjoying them at this di&s;tance, though but in imagination.</P>
<P>You de&s;cended from the hou&s;e between two groves of trees, planted in &s;uch a manner, that they were im|penetrable to the eye; while on each hand the way was adorned with all that was beautiful in porcelaine, &s;tatuary, and painting. This pa&s;&s;age from the hou&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="133">
opened into an area &s;urrounded with rocks, flowers, trees and &s;hrubs, but all &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as if each was the &s;pontaneous production of nature. As you proceeded forward on this lawn, to your right and left-hand were two gates, oppo&s;ite each other, of very different architecture and de&s;ign; and before you lay a temple built rather with minute elegance than o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>The right-hand gate was planned with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity, or rather rudene&s;s; ivy cla&s;p'd round the pillars, the baleful cypre&s;s hung over it; time &s;eemed to have de&s;troyed all the &s;moothne&s;s and regularity of the &s;tone: two champions with lifted clubs appeared in the act of guarding its acce&s;s; dragons and &s;erpents were &s;een in the mo&s;t hideous attitudes, to deter the &s;pectator from approaching; and the per&s;pective view that lay behind &s;eemed dark and gloomy to the la&s;t de|gree; the &s;tranger was tempted to enter only from the motto: PERVIA VIRTUTI.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite gate was formed in a very different manner; the architecture was light, elegant, and invi|ting; flowers hung in wreaths round the pillars; all was fini&s;hed in the mo&s;t exact and ma&s;terly manner; the very &s;tone of which it was built &s;till pre&s;erved its poli&s;h; nymphs, wrought by the hand of a ma&s;ter, in the mo&s;t alluring attitudes, beckoned the &s;tranger to approach; while all that lay behind, as far as the eye could reach, &s;eemed gay, luxuriant, and capable of affording endle&s;s plea&s;ure. The motto it&s;elf contri|buted to invite him; for over the gate was written the&s;e words, FACILIS DESCENSUS.</P>
<P>By this time I fancy you begin to perceive that the
<PB N="135" REF="134">
gloomy gate was de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the road to vir|tue; the oppo&s;ite, the more agreeable pa&s;&s;age to vice. It is but natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;pectator was always tempted to enter by the gate which offered him &s;o many allurements; I always in the&s;e ca&s;es left him to his choice; but generally found that he took to the left, which promi&s;ed mo&s;t entertainment.</P>
<P>Immediately upon his entering the gate of vice, the trees and flowers were di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to make the mo&s;t plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion; but as he walked farther on he in&s;en&s;ibly found the garden a&s;&s;ume the air of a wilderne&s;s, the land&s;kips began to darken, the paths grew more intricate, he appeared to go down|wards, frightful rocks &s;eemed to hang over his head, gloomy caverns, unexpected precipices, awful ruins, heaps of unburied bones, and terrifying &s;ounds, cau&s;ed by un&s;een waters, began to take place of what at fir&s;t appeared &s;o lovely: it was in vain to attempt returning, the labyrinth was too much perplexed for any but my&s;elf to find the way back. In &s;hort, when &s;ufficiently im|pre&s;&s;ed with the horrors of what he &s;aw, and the im|prudence of his choice, I brought him by an hidden door, a &s;horter way back into the area from whence at fir&s;t he had &s;trayed.</P>
<P>The gloomy gate now pre&s;ented it&s;elf before the &s;tranger; and though there &s;eemed little in its appear|ance to tempt his curio&s;ity, yet encouraged by the motto, he generally proceeded. The darkne&s;s of the entrance, the frightful figures that &s;eemed to ob&s;truct his way, the trees of a mournful green, con&s;pired at fir&s;t to di&s;gu&s;t him: as he went forward, however, all began to open and wear a more plea&s;ing appearance,
<PB N="136" REF="135">
beautiful ca&s;cades, beds of flowers, trees loaded with fruit or blo&s;&s;oms, and unexpected brooks, improved the &s;cene; he now found that he was a&s;cending, and, as he proceeded, all nature grew more beautiful, the pro&s;pect widened as he went higher, even the air it&s;elf &s;eemed to become more pure. Thus plea&s;|ed and happy from unexpected beauties, I at la&s;t led him to an arbour, from whence he could view the garden and the whole country around, and where he might own, that the road to Virtue terminated in Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Though from this de&s;cription you may imagine, that a va&s;t tract of ground was nece&s;&s;ary to exhibit &s;uch a plea&s;ing variety in, yet be a&s;&s;ured, that I have &s;een &s;everal gardens in England take up ten times the &s;pace which mine did, without half the beauty. A very &s;mall extent of ground is enough for an elegant ta&s;te; the greater room is required if magnificence is in view. There is no &s;pot, tho' ever &s;o little, which a &s;kilful de&s;igner might not thus improve, &s;o as to convey a delicate allegory, and impre&s;s the mind with truths the mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>IN a late excur&s;ion with my friend into the country, a gentleman with a blue ribbon tied round his &s;houlder, and in a chariot drawn by &s;ix hor&s;es pa&s;&s;ed &s;wiftly by us, attended with a numerous train of captains,
<PB N="137" REF="136">
lacquies, and coaches filled with women. When we were recovered from the du&s;t rai&s;ed by his cavalcade, and could continue our di&s;cour&s;e without danger of &s;uffocation, I ob&s;erved to my companion, that all this &s;tate and equipage which he &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e, would in China be regarded with the utmo&s;t reverence, be|cau&s;e &s;uch di&s;tinctions were always the reward of me|rit; the greatne&s;s of a Mandarine's retinue being a mo&s;t certain mark of the &s;uperiority of his abilities or virtue.</P>
<P>The gentleman who has now pa&s;&s;ed us, replied my companion, has no claims from his own merit to di&s;tinc|tion; he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither of abilities nor virtue; it is enough for him that one of his ance&s;tors was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e qualities two hundred years before him. There was a time, indeed, when his family de&s;erved their titles, but they are long &s;ince degenerated, and his ance&s;tors for more than a century have been more and more &s;olicitous to keep up the breed of their dogs and hor&s;es than that of their children. This very no|bleman, &s;imple as he &s;eems, is de&s;cended from a race of &s;tate&s;men and heroes; but unluckily his great grand|father marrying a cook maid, and &s;he having a trifling pa&s;&s;ion for his lord&s;hip's groom, they &s;ome-how cro&s;&s;ed the &s;train, and produced an heir, who took after his mother in his great love to <HI>good eating,</HI> and his father in a violent affection for <HI>hor&s;e fle&s;h.</HI> The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have for &s;ome generations pa&s;&s;ed on from father to &s;on, and are now become the characteri&s;tics of the family, his pre&s;ent lord&s;hip being equally remarkable for his kitchen and &s;table.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a nobleman, cried I, de&s;erves our pity thus placed in &s;o high a &s;phere of life, which only the more
<PB N="138" REF="137">
expo&s;es to contempt. A king may confer titles, but it is per&s;onal merit alone that in&s;ures re&s;pect. I &s;uppo&s;e, added I, that &s;uch men who are &s;o very unfit to fill up their dignity, are de&s;pi&s;ed by their equals, neglected by their inferiors, and condemned to live among involun|tary dependants in irk&s;ome &s;olitude?</P>
<P>You are &s;till under a mi&s;take, replied my companion, for though this nobleman is a &s;tranger to genero&s;ity; though he takes twenty opportunities in a day of letting his gue&s;ts know how much he de&s;pi&s;es them; though he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither of ta&s;te, wit, nor wi&s;dom; though incapable of improving others by his conver&s;a|tion, and never known to enrich any by his bounty, yet for all this, his company is eagerly &s;ought after: he is a lord, and that is as much as mo&s;t people de&s;ire in a companion. Quality and title have &s;uch allure|ments, that hundreds are ready to give up all their own importance, to cringe, to flatter, to look little, and to pall every plea&s;ure in con&s;traint, merely to be among the great, though without the lea&s;t hopes of improving their under&s;tanding or &s;haring their genero&s;ity; they might be happy among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> equals, but tho&s;e are de&s;|pi&s;ed for company, where they are de&s;pi&s;ed in turn. You &s;aw what a crowd of humble cou&s;ins, card-ruined beaus, and captains on half pay, were willing to make up this great man's retinue down to his country &s;eat. Not one of all the&s;e that could not lead a more com|fortable life at home in their little lodging of three &s;hillings a week, with their lukewarm dinner, &s;erved up between two pewter plates from a cook's &s;hop. Yet poor devils, they are willing to undergo the imperti|nence and pride of their entertainer, merely to be thought to live among the great: they are willing to

pa&s;s the &s;ummer in bondage, though con&s;cious they are taken down only to approve his lord&s;hip's ta&s;te upon every occa&s;ion, to tag all his &s;tupid ob&s;ervations with a <HI>very true,</HI> to prai&s;e his &s;table, and de&s;cant upon his claret and cookery.</P>
<P>The pitiful humiliations of the gentlemen you are now de&s;cribing, &s;aid I, puts me in mind of a cu&s;tom among the Tartars of Koreki, not entirely di&s;&s;imilar to this we are now con&s;idering<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Van Stralenberg, a writer of credit, gives the &s;ame account of this people. Vid. an Hi&s;torico Geographical De&s;cription of the north ea&s;tern parts of Europe and A&s;ia, p. 397.</NOTE>. The Ru&s;&s;ians, who trade with them carry thither a kind of mu&s;hrooms, which they exchange for furrs of &s;quirrels, ermins, &s;ables, and foxes. The&s;e mu&s;hrooms the rich tartars lay up in large quantities for the winter; and when a nobleman makes a mu&s;hroom fea&s;t, all the neighbours around are invited. The mu&s;hrooms are prepared by boiling, by which the water acquires an intoxicating quality, and is a &s;ort of drink which the Tartars prize beyond all other. When the nobility and ladies are a&s;&s;embled, and the ceremonies u&s;ual between people of di&s;tinction over, the mu&s;hroom broth goes freely round; they laugh, talk double entendre, grow fuddled, and become excellent company. The poorer &s;ort, who love mu&s;hroom broth to di&s;traction as well as the rich, but cannot afford it at the fir&s;t hand, po&s;t them|&s;elves on the&s;e occa&s;ions round the huts of the rich, and watch the opportunities of the ladies and gentle|men as they come down to pa&s;s their liquor, and hold|ing a wooden bowl, catch the delicious fluid very little altered by filtration, being &s;till &s;trongly tinctured with the intoxicating quality. Of this they drink with the

<P>Happy nobility, cries my companion, who can fear no diminution of re&s;pect, unle&s;s by being &s;eized with a &s;trangury; and who when mo&s;t drunk are mo&s;t u&s;e|ful; though we have not this cu&s;tom among us, I fore&s;ee, that if it were introduced, we might have many a toad-eater in England ready to drink from the wooden bowl on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and to prai&s;e the flavour of his lord&s;hip's liquor: As we have different cla&s;&s;es of gentry, who knows but we might &s;ee a lord holding the bowl to a mini&s;ter, a knight holding it to his lord|&s;hip, and a &s;imple '&s;quire drinking it doubled di&s;tilled from the loins of knighthood. For my part, I &s;hall never for the future hear a great man's flatterers ha|ranguing in his prai&s;e, that I &s;hall not fancy I behold the wooden bowl; for I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why a man who can live ea&s;ily and happily at home, &s;hould bear the drudgery of decorum and the impertinence of his entertainer, unle&s;s intoxicated with a pa&s;&s;ion for all that was quality; unle&s;s he thought that whatever came from the great was delicious, and had the tincture of the mu&s;hroom in it.</P>

him&s;elf in metaphor; &s;wear by Alla, rail again&s;t wine, and behave, and talk and write like a Turk or Per&s;ian. They make no di&s;tinction between our elegant manners, and the voluptuous barbarities of our ea&s;tern neigh|bours. Where-ever I come, I rai&s;e either diffidence or a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;ome fancy me no Chine&s;e, becau&s;e I am formed more like a man than a mon&s;ter; and others wonder to find one born five thou&s;and miles from England endued with common &s;en&s;e. Strange, &s;ay they, that a man who has received his education at &s;uch a di&s;tance from London, &s;hould have common &s;en&s;e; to be born out of England and yet have com|mon &s;en&s;e! impo&s;&s;ible! He mu&s;t be &s;ome Engli&s;hman in di&s;gui&s;e; his very vi&s;age has nothing of the true ex|otic barbarity.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday received an invitation from a lady of di&s;|tinction, who it &s;eems had collected all her knowledge of ea&s;tern manners from fictions every day propagated here, under the titles of ea&s;tern tales, and oriental hi&s;to|ries: &s;he received me very politely, but &s;eemed to won|der that I neglected bringing opium and a tobacco-box; when chairs were drawn for the re&s;t of the company, I was a&s;&s;igned my place on a cu&s;hion on the floor. It was in vain that I prote&s;ted the Chine&s;e u&s;ed chairs as in Europe; &s;he under&s;tood decorums too well to enter|tain me with the ordinary civilities.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce been &s;eated according to her directions, when the footman was ordered to pin a napkin under my chin; this I prote&s;ted again&s;t, as being no way Chine&s;e; however, the whole company, who it &s;eems were a club of connoi&s;&s;eurs, gave it unanimou&s;ly again&s;t me, and the napkin was pinned accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="141">
It was impo&s;&s;ible to be angry with people, who &s;eem|ed to err only from an exce&s;s of politene&s;s, and I &s;at contented, expecting their importunities were now at an end; but as &s;oon as ever dinner was &s;erved, the lady demanded whether I was for a plate of <HI>Bears claws,</HI> or a &s;lice of <HI>Birds ne&s;ts?</HI> As the&s;e were di&s;hes with which I was utterly unacquainted, I was de&s;irous of eating only what I knew, and therefore begged to be helped from a piece of beef that lay on the &s;ide table: my reque&s;t at once di&s;concerted the whole company. A Chine&s;e eat beef! that could never be! there was no local propriety in Chine&s;e beef, whatever there might be in Chine&s;e phea&s;ant. Sir, &s;aid my entertainer, I think I have &s;ome rea&s;ons to fancy my&s;elf a judge of the&s;e matters: in &s;hort, the Chine&s;e never eat beef; &s;o that I mu&s;t be permitted to recommend the Pilaw, there was never better dre&s;&s;ed at Pekin; the &s;affron and rice are well boiled, and the &s;pices in perfection.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner begun to eat what was laid before me, than I found the whole company as much a&s;toni&s;h|ed as before; it &s;eems I made no u&s;e of my chop-&s;ticks. A grave gentleman, whom I take to be an author, ha|rangued very learnedly (as the company &s;eemed to think) upon the u&s;e which was made of them in China: he entered into a long argument with him&s;elf about their fir&s;t introduction, without once appealing to me, who might be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t capable of &s;ilencing the enquiry. As the gentleman therefore took my &s;ilence for a mark of his own &s;uperior &s;agacity, he was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the triumph: he talked of our cities, moun|tains, and animals, as familiarly as if he had been born in Quam&s;i, but as erroneou&s;ly as if a native of the moon; he attempted to prove that I had nothing of the true
<PB N="143" REF="142">
Chine&s;e cut in my vi&s;age; &s;hewed that my cheek bones &s;hould have been higher, and my forehead broader; in &s;hort, he almo&s;t rea&s;oned me out of my country, and effectually per&s;uaded the re&s;t of the company to be of his opinion.</P>
<P>I was going to expo&s;e his mi&s;takes, when it was in|&s;i&s;ted that I had nothing of the true ea&s;tern manner in my delivery. This gentleman's conver&s;ation (&s;ays one of the ladies, who was a great reader) is like our own mere chit chat and common &s;en&s;e; there is nothing like &s;en&s;e in the true ea&s;tern &s;tyle, where nothing more is required but &s;ublimity. Oh for an hi&s;tory of Aboul|faouris, the grand voyager, of genii, magicians, rocks, bags of bullets, giants, and enchanters, where all is great ob&s;cure, magnificent, and unintelligible! I have written many a &s;heet of ea&s;tern tale my&s;elf, interrupts the author, and I defy the &s;evere&s;t critic to &s;ay but that I have &s;tuck clo&s;e to the true manner. I have com|pared a lady's chin to the &s;now upon the mountains of Bomek; a &s;oldier's &s;word, to the clouds that ob&s;cure the face of heaven. If riches are mentioned, I compare them to the flocks that graze the verdant Tefflis; if poverty, to the mi&s;ts that veil the brow of mount Baku. I have u&s;ed <HI>thee</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> upon all occa&s;ions, I have de&s;cribed fallen &s;tars, and &s;plitting mountains, not for|getting the little Houries who make a very pretty figure in every de&s;cription. But you &s;hall hear how I generally begin. "Eben-ben-bolo, who was the &s;on of Ban, was born on the foggy &s;ummits of Bender|aba&s;&s;i. His beard was whiter than the feathers which veil the brea&s;t of the Penguin; his eyes were like the eyes of doves, when wa&s;hed by the dews of the morn|ing; his hair, which hung like the willow weeping over
<PB N="144" REF="143">
the gla&s;&s;y &s;tream, was &s;o beautiful that it &s;eemed to re|flect its own brightne&s;s; and his feet were as the feet of a wild deer which fleeth to the tops of the moun|tains." There, there is the true ea&s;tern ta&s;te for you; every advance made towards &s;en&s;e, is only a deviation from &s;ound. Ea&s;tern tales &s;hould always be &s;onorous, lofty, mu&s;ical and unmeaning.</P>
<P>I could not avoid &s;miling to hear a native of England attempt to in&s;truct me in the true ea&s;tern idiom, and after he had looked round &s;ome time for applau&s;e, I pre&s;umed to a&s;k him whether he had ever travelled into the ea&s;t; to which he replied in the negative: I demanded whether he under&s;tood Chine&s;e or Arabic, to which al&s;o he an&s;wered as before. Then how, Sir, &s;aid I, can you pretend to determine upon the ea&s;tern &s;tile, who are intirely unacquainted with the ea&s;tern writings? Take, Sir, the word of one who is <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;edly</HI> a Chine&s;e, and who is actually acquainted with the Arabian writers, that what is palm'd upon you daily for an imitation of ea&s;tern writing, no ways re|&s;embles their manner, either in &s;entiment or diction. In the ea&s;t, &s;imiles are &s;eldom u&s;ed, and metaphors al|mo&s;t wholly unknown; but in China particularly, the very rever&s;e of what you allude to, takes place; a cool phlegmatic method of writing prevails there. The writers of that country, ever more a&s;&s;iduous to in&s;truct than to plea&s;e, addre&s;s rather the judgment than the fancy. Unlike many authors of Europe, who have no con&s;ideration of the reader's time, they generally leave more to be under&s;tood than they expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, you mu&s;t not expect from an inhabi|tant of China the &s;ame ignorance, the &s;ame unlettered

&s;implicity, that you find in a <HI>Turk, Per&s;ian,</HI> or native of <HI>Peru.</HI> The Chine&s;e are ver&s;ed in the &s;ciences as well as you, and are ma&s;ters of &s;everal arts unknown to the people of Europe.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>THE polite arts are in this country &s;ubject to as many revolutions as its laws or politics; not only the objects of fancy and dre&s;s, but even of de|licacy and ta&s;te, are directed by the capricious influence of fa&s;hion. I am told there has been a time when poetry was univer&s;ally encouraged by the great, when men of the fir&s;t rank not only patronized the poet, but produced the fine&s;t models for his imitation; it was
<PB N="147" REF="146">
then that the Engli&s;h &s;ent forth tho&s;e glowing rhap&s;o|dies, which we have &s;o often read over together with rapture; poems big with all the &s;ublimity of Mentius, and &s;upported by rea&s;oning as &s;trong as that of Zimpo.</P>
<P>The nobility are ever fond of wi&s;dom, but they al&s;o are fond of having it without &s;tudy; to read poetry required thought, and the Engli&s;h nobility were not fond of thinking; they &s;oon therefore placed their affections upon mu&s;ic, becau&s;e in this they might in|dulge an happy vacancy, and yet &s;till have preten&s;ions to delicacy and ta&s;te as before. They &s;oon brought their numerous dependents into an approbation of their plea&s;ures; who in turn led their thou&s;and imitators to feel or feign a &s;imilitude of pa&s;&s;ion. Colonies of &s;ingers were now imported from abroad at a va&s;t expence, and it was expected the Engli&s;h would &s;oon be able to &s;et examples to Europe; all the&s;e expectations how|ever were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated; in &s;pite of the zeal which fired the great, the ignorant vulgar refu&s;ed to be taught to &s;ing; and refu&s;ed to undergo the ceremonies which were to initiate them in the &s;inging fraternity; thus the colony from abroad dwindled by degrees; for they were of them&s;elves unfortunately incapable of propagating the breed.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic having thus lo&s;t its &s;plendour, Painting is now become the &s;ole object of fa&s;hionable care; the title of connoi&s;&s;eur in that art is at pre&s;ent the &s;afe&s;t pa&s;&s;|port into every fa&s;hionable &s;ociety; a well timed &s;hrug, an admiring attitude, and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are &s;ufficient qualifications for men of low circum&s;tances to curry favour; even &s;ome of the
<PB N="148" REF="147">
young nobility are them&s;elves early in&s;tructed in hand|ling the pencil, while their happy parents, big with expectation, fore&s;ee the walls of every apartment co|vered with the manufactures of their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But many of the Engli&s;h are not content with giv|ing all their time to this art at home; &s;ome young men of di&s;tinction are found to travel through Europe with no other intent than that of under&s;tanding, and collecting pictures, &s;tudying &s;eals, and de&s;cribing &s;ta|tues; on they travel from this cabinet of curio&s;ities to that gallery of pictures, wa&s;te the prime of life in wonder, &s;kilful in pictures, ignorant in men; yet im|po&s;&s;ible to be reclaimed, becau&s;e their follies take &s;helter under the names of delicacy and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is true, Painting &s;hould have due encourage|ment; as the painter can undoubtedly fit up our apartments in a much more elegant manner than the uphol&s;terer; but I &s;hould think a man of fa&s;hion makes but an indifferent exchange, who lays out all that time in furni&s;hing his hou&s;e which he &s;hould have employed in the furniture of his head; a per&s;on who &s;hews no other &s;ymptoms of ta&s;te than his cabinet or gallery, might as well boa&s;t to me of the furniture of his kitchen.</P>
<P>I know no other motive but vanity that induces the great to te&s;tify &s;uch an inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for pic|tures; after the piece is bought, and gazed at eight or ten days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, the purcha&s;er's plea&s;ure mu&s;t &s;urely be over; all the &s;atisfaction he can then have, is to &s;hew it to others; he may be con&s;idered as the guardian of a trea&s;ure of which he makes no manner of u&s;e; his gallery is furni&s;hed not for him&s;elf, but the

connoi&s;&s;eur, who is generally &s;ome humble flatterer, ready to feign a rapture he does not feel; and as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a picture-buyer, as gazers are to the magnificence of an A&s;iatic proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have enclo&s;ed a letter from a youth of di&s;tinction, on his travels, to his father in England; in which he appears addicted to no vice, &s;eems obedient to his governor, of a good natural di&s;po&s;ition, and fond of improvement; but at the &s;ame time early taught to regard cabinets and galleries as the only proper &s;chools of improvement, and to con&s;ider a &s;kill in pictures as the propere&s;t knowledge for a man of quality.</P>

<P>We have been but two days at Antwerp; where|fore I have &s;at down as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to give you &s;ome account of what we have &s;een &s;ince our arrival, de&s;i|rous of letting no opportunity pa&s;s without writing to &s;o good a father. Immediately upon alighting from our Rotterdam machine, my governor, who is immo|derately fond of paintings, and at the &s;ame time an excellent judge, would let no time pa&s;s till we paid our re&s;pects to the church of the virgin-mother, which contains trea&s;ure beyond e&s;timation. We took an in|finity of pains in knowing its exact dimen&s;ions, and differed half a foot in our calculation; &s;o I leave that to &s;ome &s;ucceeding information. I really believe my governor and I could have lived and died there. There is &s;carce a pillar in the whole church that is not adorned by a Reubens, a Vander Meuylen, a Van|dyke or a Woverman. What attitudes, carnation and draperies! I am almo&s;t induced to pity the Engli&s;h who have none of tho&s;e exqui&s;ite pieces among them.
<PB N="150" REF="149">
As we were willing to let &s;lip no opportunity of doing bu&s;ine&s;s, we immediately after went to wait on Mr. Hogendorp whom you have &s;o frequently commended for his judicious collection. His cameos are indeed beyond price; his intaglio's not &s;o good. He &s;hewed us one of an officiating flamen, which he thought to be an antique; but my governor, who is not to be de|ceived in the&s;e particulars, &s;oon found it to be an arrant <HI>cinque cento.</HI> I could not, however, &s;ufficiently admire the genius of Mr. Hogendorp, who has been able to collect from all parts of the world, a thou&s;and things which no body knows the u&s;e of. Except your lord&s;hip and my governor, I do not know any body I admire &s;o much. He is indeed a &s;urprizing genius. The next morning early, as we were re&s;olved to take the whole day before us, we &s;ent our compliments to Mr. Van Sporkcken, de&s;iring to &s;ee his gallery, which reque&s;t he very politely complied with. His gal|lery mea&s;ures fifty feet by twenty, and is well filled; but what &s;urpri&s;ed me mo&s;t of all, was to &s;ee an holy family ju&s;t like your lord&s;hip's, which this ingenious gentleman a&s;&s;ures me is the true original. I own this gave me in|expre&s;&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s, and I fear it will to your lord&s;hip, as I had flattered my&s;elf that the only original was in your lord&s;hip's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I would advi&s;e you, how|ever, to take yours down till its merit can be a&s;certain|ed, my governor a&s;&s;uring me, that he intends to write a long differtation to prove its originality. One might &s;tudy in this city for ages, and &s;till find &s;omething new: we went from this to view the cardinal's &s;tatues, which are really very fine; there were three &s;pintria executed in a very ma&s;terly manner, all arm in arm: the tor&s;e which I heard you talk &s;o much of, is at la&s;t di&s;covered to be a Hercules &s;pinning, and not a Cleo|patra

<P>My lord Firmly is certainly a Goth, a Vandal, no ta&s;te in the world for painting.

&s;hrink with my circum&s;tances. I feel my mind not le&s;s than my body, bend beneath the rigours of &s;ervi|tude; the ma&s;ter whom I &s;erve grows every day more formidable. In &s;pite of rea&s;on which &s;hould teach me to de&s;pi&s;e him, his hideous image fills even my dreams with horror.</P>
<P>A few days ago a chri&s;tian &s;lave, who wrought in the gardens, happening to enter an arbour where the tyrant was entertaining the ladies of his Haram with coffee, the unhappy captive was in&s;tantly &s;tabbed to the heart for his intru&s;ion. I have been preferred to his place, which though le&s;s laborious than my former &s;tation, is yet more ungrateful, as it brings me nearer him who&s;e pre&s;ence excites &s;en&s;ations at once of di&s;gu&s;t and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Into what a &s;tate of mi&s;ery are the modern Per&s;ians fallen! A nation once famous for &s;etting the world an example of freedom, is now become a land of tyrants, and a den of &s;laves. The hou&s;ele&s;s Tartar of Kam|kat&s;ha, who enjoys his herbs and his fi&s;h in unmole&s;ted freedom, may be envied, if compared to the thou&s;ands who pine here in hopele&s;s &s;ervitude, and cur&s;e the day that gave them being. Is this ju&s;t dealing, heaven! to render millions wretched to &s;well up the happine&s;s of a few; cannot the powerful of this earth be happy without our &s;ighs and tears; mu&s;t every luxury of the great be woven from the calamities of the poor! It mu&s;t, it mu&s;t &s;urely be, that this jarring di&s;cordant life is but the prelude to &s;ome future harmony; the &s;ouls attuned to virtue here, &s;hall go from hence to fill up the univer&s;al choir where Tien pre&s;ides in per|&s;on; where there &s;hall be no tyrants to frown, no

&s;hackles to bind, nor no whips to threaten; where I &s;hall once more meet my father with rapture, and give a loo&s;e to filial piety; where I &s;hall hang on his neck, and hear the wi&s;dom of his lips, and thank him for all the happine&s;s to which he has introduced me.</P>
<P>The wretch whom fortune has made my ma&s;ter, has lately purcha&s;ed &s;everal &s;laves of both &s;exes; among the re&s;t I hear a chri&s;tian captive talked of with admi|ration. The eunuch who bought her, and who is accu&s;tomed to &s;urvey beauty with indifference, &s;peaks of her with emotion! Her pride, however, a&s;toni&s;hes her attendant &s;laves not le&s;s than her beauty; it is re|ported that &s;he refu&s;es the warme&s;t &s;olicitations of her haughty lord; he has even offered to make her one of his four wives upon changing her religion, and con|forming to his. It is probable &s;he cannot refu&s;e &s;uch extraordinary offers, and her delay is perhaps intended to enhance her favours.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now &s;een her, &s;he inadvertently approach|ed the place without a veil, where I &s;at waiting. She &s;eemed to regard the heavens alone with fixed atten|tion; there her mo&s;t ardent gaze was directed. Genius of the &s;un! what unexpected &s;oftne&s;s! what animated grace! her beauty &s;eemed the tran&s;parent covering of virtue. Cele&s;tial beings could not wear a look of more perfection, while &s;orrow humanized her form, and mixed my admiration with pity. I ro&s;e from the bank on which I &s;at, and &s;he retired; happy that none ob&s;erved us, for &s;uch an interview might have been fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
I have regarded, till now, the opulence and the power of my tyrant, without envy; I &s;aw him with a mind incapable of enjoying the gifts of fortune, and con&s;equently regarded him as one loaded, rather than enriched with its favours. But at pre&s;ent, when I think that &s;o much beauty is re&s;erved only for him, that &s;o many charms &s;hall be lavi&s;hed on a wretch in|capable of feeling the greatne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing, I own I feel a reluctance to which I have hitherto been a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>But let not my father impute the&s;e unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations to &s;o trifling a cau&s;e as love. No, never let it be thought that <HI>your</HI> &s;on, and the pupil of the wi&s;e Fum Hoam could &s;toop to &s;o degrading a pa&s;&s;ion. I am only di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing &s;o much excellence &s;o unju&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The unea&s;ine&s;s which I feel is not for my&s;elf, but for the beautiful chri&s;tian. When I reflect on the bar|barity of him for whom &s;he is de&s;igned, I pity, indeed I pity her. When I think that &s;he mu&s;t only &s;hare one heart, who de&s;erves to command a thou&s;and, ex|cu&s;e me, if I feel an emotion, which univer&s;al bene|volence extorts from me. As I am convinced, that you take a plea&s;ure in tho&s;e &s;allies of humanity, and are particularly plea&s;ed with compa&s;&s;ion, I could not avoid di&s;covering the &s;en&s;ibility with which I felt this beautiful &s;tranger's di&s;tre&s;s. I have for a while forgot in hers, the mi&s;eries of my own hopele&s;s &s;ituation.

<P>THE whole Haram is filled with a tumultuous joy; Zelis, the beautiful captive, has con&s;ented to embrace the religion of Mahomet, and become one of the wives of the fa&s;tidious Per&s;ian. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the tran&s;port that &s;its on every face on this occa&s;ion. Mu&s;ic and fea&s;ting fill every apartment, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;lave &s;eems to forget his chains, and &s;ympathizes with the happine&s;s of Mo&s;tadad.

Heavens! how much is requi&s;ite to make one man happy!</P>
<P>Twelve of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;laves, and I among the number, have got orders to prepare for carrying him in triumph to the bridal apartment. The blaze of perfumed torches are to imitate the day; the dancers and &s;ingers are hired at a va&s;t expen&s;e.

<P>What will not riches procure! an hundred dome&s;|tics, who cur&s;e the tyrant in their &s;ouls, are commanded to wear a face of joy, and they are joyful. An hun|dred flatterers are ordered to attend, and they fill his ears with prai&s;e. Beauty, all commanding beauty, &s;ues

Six ladies, in all the magnificence of Per&s;ia, are directed to undre&s;s the bride. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to a&s;&s;i&s;t, to encou|rage her, to dive&s;t her of every encumbering part of her dre&s;s, all but the la&s;t covering, which, by an artful complication of ribbons, is purpo&s;ely made difficult to unloo&s;e, and with which &s;he is to part reluctantly even to the joyful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of her beauty.</P>
<P>Mo&s;tadad, O my father, is no philo&s;opher; and yet he &s;eems perfectly contented with his ignorance. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of numberle&s;s &s;laves, camels, and women, he de&s;ires no greater po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He never opened the page of Mentius, and yet all the &s;laves tell me that he is happy.</P>
<P>Forgive the weakne&s;s of my nature, if I &s;ometimes feel my heart rebellious to the dictates of wi&s;dom, and eager for happine&s;s like his. Yet why wi&s;h for his wealth with his ignorance; to be like him, incapable of &s;entimental plea&s;ures, incapable of feeling the hap|pine&s;s of making others happy, incapable of teaching the beautiful Zelis philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>What, &s;hall I in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion give up the

golden mean, the univer&s;al harmony, the unchanging e&s;&s;ence, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hundred camels, as many &s;laves, thirty-five beautiful hor&s;es, and &s;eventy|three fine women: fir&s;t bla&s;t me to the centre! De|grade me beneath the mo&s;t degraded! Pare my nails, ye powers of heaven! ere I would &s;toop to &s;uch an exchange.

<P>A female &s;lave informs me that the bride is to be arrayed in a ti&s;&s;ue of &s;ilver, and her hair adorned with the large&s;t pearls of Ormus; but why teize you with particulars, in which we both are &s;o little concerned; the pain I feel in &s;eparation throws a gloom over my mind, which in this &s;cene of univer&s;al joy I fear may be attributed to &s;ome other cau&s;e; how wretched are tho&s;e who are like me, denied even the la&s;t re&s;ource of mi&s;ery, their tears.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I Begin to have doubts whether wi&s;dom be alone &s;uf|ficient to make us happy. Whether every &s;tep we make in refinement is not an inlet into new di&s;quie|tudes. A mind too vigorous and active, &s;erves only to
<PB N="158" REF="159">
con&s;ume the body to which it is joined, as the riche&s;t jewels are &s;oone&s;t found to wear their &s;ettings.</P>
<P>When we ri&s;e in knowledge as the pro&s;pect widens, the objects of our regard become more ob&s;cure, and the unlettered pea&s;ant, who&s;e views are only directed to the narrow &s;phere around him, beholds nature with a finer reli&s;h, and ta&s;tes her ble&s;&s;ings with a keener appetite than the philo&s;opher, who&s;e mind attempts to gra&s;p an univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>As I was &s;ome days ago pur&s;uing this &s;ubject among a circle of my fellow &s;laves, an ancient Guebre of the number, equally remarkable for his piety and wi&s;dom, &s;eemed touched with my conver&s;ation, and de&s;ired to il|lu&s;trate what I had been &s;aying with an allegory taken from the Zendave&s;ta of Zoroa&s;ter; by this we &s;hall be taught, &s;ays he, that they who travel in pur&s;uit of wi&s;|dom, walk only in a circle; and after all their labour, at la&s;t return to their pri&s;tine ignorance; and in this al&s;o we &s;hall &s;ee that enthu&s;ia&s;tic confidence, or un&s;a|tisfying doubts terminate all our enquiries.</P>
<P>In early times, before myriads of nations covered the earth, the whole human race lived together in one val|ley. The &s;imple inhabitants, &s;urrounded on every &s;ide by lofty mountains, knew no other world but the little &s;pot to which they were confined. They fancied the heavens bent down to meet the mountain tops, and formed an impenetrable wall to &s;urround them. None had ever yet ventured to climb the &s;teepy cliff, in or|der to explore tho&s;e regions that lay beyond it; they knew the nature of the &s;kies only from a tradition, which mentioned their being made of adamant; tradi|tions make up the rea&s;onings of the &s;imple, and &s;erve to &s;ilence every enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
In this &s;eque&s;tered vale, ble&s;s'd with all the &s;ponta|neous productions of nature, the honey'd blo&s;&s;om, the refre&s;hing breeze, the gliding brook, and golden fruitage, the &s;imple inhabitants &s;eemed happy in them&s;elves, in each other; they de&s;ired no greater plea&s;ures, for they knew of none greater; ambition, pride and envy, were vices unknown among them; and from this peculiar &s;implicity of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, the country was called <HI>the valley of ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>At length, however, an unhappy youth more a&s;pir|ring than the re&s;t undertook to climb the mountain's &s;ide, and examine the &s;ummits which were hitherto deemed inacce&s;&s;ible. The inhabitants from below, gazed with wonder at his intrepidity, &s;ome applauded his courage, others cen&s;ured his folly, &s;till however he proceeded towards the place where the earth and hea|vens &s;eemed to unite, and at length arrived at the wi&s;h'd for height with extreme labour and a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t &s;urprize was to find the &s;kies, not as he ex|pected within his reach, but &s;till as far off as before; his amazement encrea&s;ed when he &s;aw a wide extended region lying on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the mountain, but it ro&s;e to a&s;toni&s;hment when he beheld a country at a di&s;tance, more beautiful and alluring than even that he had ju&s;t left behind.</P>
<P>As he continued to gaze with wonder, a genius, with a look of infinite mode&s;ty, approaching, offered to be his guide and in&s;tructor. The di&s;tant country which you &s;o much admire, &s;ays the Angelic being, is called <HI>the Land of Certainty,</HI> in that charming retreat, &s;enti|ment contributes to refine every &s;en&s;ual banquet; the inhabitants are ble&s;&s;ed with every &s;olid enjoyment, and
<PB N="160" REF="161">
&s;till more ble&s;&s;ed in a perfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own felicity: ignorance in that country is wholly unknown, all there is &s;atisfaction without allay, for every plea|&s;ure fir&s;t undergoes the examination of rea&s;on. As for me I am called the genius of <HI>Demon&s;tration,</HI> and am &s;tationed here in order to conduct every adventurer to that land of happine&s;s thro' tho&s;e intervening regions you &s;ee over-hung with fogs and darkne&s;s, and horrid with fore&s;ts, cataracts, caverns, and various other &s;hapes of danger. But follow me, and in time I may lead you to that di&s;tant de&s;irable land of tranquillity.</P>
<P>The intrepid traveller immediately put him&s;elf under the direction of the genius, and both journeying on to|gether with a &s;low but agreeable pace, deceived the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the way by conver&s;ation. The begin|ning of the journey &s;eemed to promi&s;e true &s;atisfaction, but as they proceeded forward, the &s;kies became more gloomy and the way more intricate, they often inad|vertently approached the brow of &s;ome frightful pre|cipice, or the brink of a torrent, and were obliged to mea&s;ure back their former way; the gloom encrea&s;ing as they proceeded, their pace became more &s;low; they pau&s;ed at every &s;tep, frequently &s;tumbled, and their di&s;tru&s;t and timidity encrea&s;ed. The genius of Demon|&s;tration, now, therefore advi&s;ed his pupil to grope upon hands and feet, as a method though more &s;low, yet le&s;s liable to error.</P>
<P>In this manner they attempted to pur&s;ue their jour|ney for &s;ome time, when they were overtaken by ano|ther genius, who, with a precipitate pace &s;eem'd tra|velling the &s;ame way. He was in&s;tantly known by the other to be <HI>the genius of Probability.</HI> He wore two
<PB N="161" REF="162">
wide extended wings at his back, which ince&s;&s;antly waved, without increa&s;ing the rapidity of his motion; his countenance betrayed a confidence that the igno|rant might mi&s;take for &s;incerity, and he had but one eye, which was fixed in the middle of his forehead.</P>
<P>Servant of Hormizda, cried he, approaching the mortal pilgrim, if thou art travelling to the <HI>Land of Certainty,</HI> how is it po&s;&s;ible to arrive there under the guidance of a genius, who proceeds forward &s;o &s;lowly, and is &s;o little acquainted with the way; follow me, we &s;hall &s;oon perform the journey to where every plea|&s;ure awaits our arrival.</P>
<P>The peremptory tone in which this genius &s;poke, and the &s;peed with which he moved forward, induced the traveller to change his conductor, and leaving his mode&s;t companion behind, he proceeded forward with his more confident director, &s;eeming not a little plea&s;ed at the encrea&s;ed velocity of his motion.</P>
<P>But &s;oon he found rea&s;ons to repent. Whenever a torrent cro&s;&s;ed their way, his guide taught him to de|&s;pi&s;e the ob&s;tacle by plunging him in; whenever a pre|cipice pre&s;ented, he was directed to fling him&s;elf for|ward. Thus each moment miraculou&s;ly e&s;caping; his repeated e&s;capes only &s;erved to encrea&s;e his guide's temerity. He led him therefore forward, amid&s;t infi|nite difficulties, till they arrived at the borders of an ocean which appeared unnavigable from the black mi&s;ts that lay upon its &s;urface. It's unquiet waves were of the darke&s;t hue, and gave a lively repre&s;entation of the various agitations of the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">
The genius of Probability now confe&s;&s;ed his teme|rity, own'd his being an improper guide to the <HI>Land of Certainty,</HI> a country where no mortal had ever been permitted to arrive; but at the &s;ame time offered to &s;upply the traveller with another conductor, who &s;hould carry him to <HI>the Land of Confidence,</HI> a region where the inhabitants lived with the utmo&s;t tranquil|lity, and ta&s;ted almo&s;t as much &s;atisfaction as if in the Land of Certainty. Not waiting for a reply, he &s;tamp'd three times on the ground, and called forth <HI>the Daemon of Error,</HI> a gloomy fiend of the &s;ervants of Arimanes. The yawning earth gave up the reluctant &s;avage, who &s;eemed unable to bear the light of the day. His &s;tature was enormous, his colour black and hideous, his a&s;pect betrayed a thou&s;and varying pa&s;&s;i|ons, and he &s;pread forth pinions that were fitted for the mo&s;t rapid flight. The traveller at fir&s;t was &s;hock|ed at the &s;pectre; but finding him obedient to &s;upe|rior power, he a&s;&s;umed his former tranquillity.</P>
<P>I have called you to duty, cries the genius to the daemon, to bear on your back a &s;on of mortality over <HI>the Ocean of Doubts</HI> into <HI>the Land of Confidence:</HI> I ex|pect you'll perform your commi&s;&s;ion with punctuality. And as for you, continued the genius, addre&s;&s;ing the traveller, when once I have bound this fillet round your eyes, let no voice of per&s;ua&s;ion, nor threats the mo&s;t terrifying, per&s;uade you to unbind it in order to look round; keep the fillet fa&s;t, look not at the ocean below, and you may certainly expect to arrive at a re|gion of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, and the traveller's eyes being covered, the daemon muttering cur&s;es, rai&s;ed him on his back,
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and in&s;tantly up-borne by his &s;trong pinions, directed his flight among the clouds. Neither the loude&s;t thun|der, nor the mo&s;t angry tempe&s;t, could per&s;uade the traveller to unbind his eyes. The daemon directed his flight downwards, and &s;kimmed the &s;urface of the ocean; a thou&s;and voices, &s;ome with loud invective, others in the &s;arca&s;tic tones of contempt, vainly endea|voured to per&s;uade him to look round; but he &s;till continued to keep his eyes covered, and would in all probability have arrived at the happy land, had not flattery effected what other means could not perform. For now he heard him&s;elf welcomed on every &s;ide to the promi&s;ed land, and an univer&s;al &s;hout of joy was &s;ent forth at his &s;afe arrival; the wearied traveller, de|&s;irous of &s;eeing the long wi&s;hed-for country, at length pulled the fillet from his eyes, and ventured to look round him. But he had unloo&s;ed the band too &s;oon; he was not yet above half way over. The daemon, who was &s;till hovering in the air, and had produced tho&s;e &s;ounds only in order to deceive, was now freed from his commi&s;&s;ion; wherefore throwing the a&s;to|ni&s;hed traveller from his back, the unhappy youth fell headlong into the &s;ubjacent Ocean of Doubts, from whence he never after was &s;een to ri&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the
Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Parmenio, the Grecian, had done &s;omething which excited an univer&s;al &s;hout
<PB N="164" REF="165">
from the &s;urrounding multitude, he was in&s;tantly &s;truck with the doubt, that what had their approba|tion mu&s;t certainly be wrong; and turning to a philo|&s;opher who &s;tood near him, <HI>Pray &s;ir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>pardon me; I fear I have been guilty of &s;ome ab&s;urdity.</HI></P>
<P>You know that I am not le&s;s than him a de&s;pi&s;er of the multitude; you know that I equally dete&s;t flattery to the great; yet &s;o many circum&s;tances have concur|red to give a lu&s;tre to the latter part of the pre&s;ent Eng|li&s;h monarch's reign, that I cannot withhold my con|tribution of prai&s;e; I cannot avoid the acknowledging the crowd for once ju&s;t, in their unanimous approba|tion.</P>
<P>Yet think not that battles gained, dominion ex|tended, or enemies brought to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, are the vir|tues which at pre&s;ent claim my admiration. Were the reigning monarch only famous for his victories, I &s;hould regard his character with indifference; the boa&s;t of heroi&s;m in this enlightened age is ju&s;tly re|garded as a qualification of a very &s;ubordinate rank, and mankind now begin to look with becoming horror on the&s;e foes to man; the virtue in this aged monarch which I have at pre&s;ent in view, is one of a much more exalted nature, is one of the mo&s;t difficult of at|tainment, is the lea&s;t prai&s;ed of all kingly virtues, and yet de&s;erves the greate&s;t prai&s;e; the virtue I mean is JUSTICE; a &s;trict admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, without &s;everity and without favour.</P>
<P>Of all virtues this is the mo&s;t difficult to be practi&s;ed by a king who has a power to pardon. All men, even
<PB N="165" REF="166">
tyrants them&s;elves, lean to mercy when unbia&s;&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ions or intere&s;t, the heart naturally per&s;uades to forgivene&s;s, and pur&s;uing the dictates of this plea&s;ing deceiver, we are led to prefer our private &s;atisfaction to public utility; what a thorough love for the public, what a &s;trong command over the pa&s;&s;ions, what a fine|ly conducted judgment mu&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;s who oppo&s;es the dictates of rea&s;on to tho&s;e of his heart, and prefers the future intere&s;t of his people to his own immediate &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>If &s;till to a man's own natural bia&s;s for tenderne&s;s, we add the numerous &s;olicitations made by a criminal's friends for mercy; if we &s;urvey a king not only oppo|&s;ing his own feelings, but reluctantly refu&s;ing tho&s;e he regards, and this to &s;atisfy the public, who&s;e cries he may never hear, who&s;e gratitude he may never receive, this &s;urely is true greatne&s;s! Let us fancy our&s;elves for a moment in this ju&s;t old man's place, &s;urrounded by numbers, all &s;oliciting the &s;ame favour, a favour that nature di&s;po&s;es us to grant, where the inducements to pity are laid before us in the &s;tronge&s;t light, &s;uppliants at our feet, &s;ome ready to re&s;ent a refu&s;al, none oppo|&s;ing a compliance; let us, I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and I fancy we &s;hould find our&s;elves more apt to act the character of good natured men than of upright magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>What contributes to rai&s;e ju&s;tice above all other kingly virtues is, that it is &s;eldom attended with a due &s;hare of applau&s;e, and tho&s;e who practi&s;e it mu&s;t be in|fluenced by greater motives than empty fame; the people are generally well plea&s;ed with a remi&s;&s;ion of puni&s;hment, and all that wears the appearance of hu|manity;
<PB N="166" REF="167">
it is the wi&s;e alone who are capable of di&s;|cerning that impartial ju&s;tice is the true&s;t mercy: they know it to be difficult very difficult, at once to compa&s;|&s;ionate, and yet condemn an object that pleads for ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have been led into this common-place train of thought by a late &s;triking in&s;tance in this country of the impartiality of ju&s;tice, and of the king's inflexible re&s;o|lution of inflicting puni&s;hment where it was ju&s;tly due. A man of the fir&s;t quality in a fit either of pa&s;&s;ion, me|lancholy, or madne&s;s, murdered his &s;ervant; it was ex|pected that his &s;tation in life would have le&s;&s;ened the ignominy of his puni&s;hment; however, he was arraign|ed, condemned, and underwent the &s;ame degrading death with the meane&s;t malefactor. It was well con|&s;idered that virtue alone is true nobility; and that he who&s;e actions &s;ink him even beneath the vulgar, has no right to tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which &s;hould be the re|wards only of merit; it was perhaps con&s;idered that crimes were more heinous among the higher cla&s;&s;es of people, as nece&s;&s;ity expo&s;es them to fewer temptations.</P>
<P>Over all the ea&s;t, even China not excepted, a per|&s;on of the &s;ame quality guilty of &s;uch a crime, might, by giving up a &s;hare of his fortune to the judge, buy off his &s;entence; there are &s;everal countries even in Europe, where the &s;ervant is entirely the property of his ma&s;ter; if a &s;lave kills his lord, he dies by the mo&s;t excruciating tortures; but if the circum&s;tances are re|ver&s;ed, a &s;mall fine buys off the puni&s;hment of the of|fender. Happy the country where all are equal, and where tho&s;e who &s;it as judges have too much integrity to receive a bribe, and too much honour to pity from a
<PB N="167" REF="168">
&s;imilitude of the pri&s;oner's title or circum&s;tances with their own. Such is England; yet think not that it was always equally famed for this &s;trict impartiality. There was a time even here when titles &s;oftned the ri|gours of the law, when dignified wretches were &s;uffer|ed to live, and continue for years an equal di&s;grace to ju&s;tice and nobility.</P>
<P>To this day in a neighbouring country, the great are often mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly pardoned for the mo&s;t &s;can|dalous offences. A per&s;on is &s;till alive among them who has more than once de&s;erved the mo&s;t ignomini|ous &s;everity of ju&s;tice. His being of the blood royal, however, was thought a &s;ufficient atonement for his being a di&s;grace to humanity. This remarkable per|&s;onage took plea&s;ure in &s;hooting at the pa&s;&s;engers be|low, from the top of his palace; and in this mo&s;t princely amu&s;ement he u&s;ually &s;pent &s;ome time every day. He was at length arraigned by the friends of a per&s;on whom in this manner he had killed, was found guilty of the charge, and condemned to die. His merciful monarch pardoned him in con&s;ideration of his rank and quality. The unrepenting criminal &s;oon af|ter renewed his u&s;ual entertainment, and in the &s;ame manner killed another man. He was a &s;econd time condemned; and &s;trange to think, a &s;econd time re|ceived his maje&s;ty's pardon! Would you believe it? A third time the very &s;ame man was guilty of the very &s;ame offence; a third time therefore the laws of his country found him guilty&mdash;I wi&s;h for the honour of humanity I could &s;uppre&s;s the re&s;t!&mdash;A third time he was pardoned! Will you not think &s;uch a &s;tory too extraordinary for belief, will you not think me de&s;crib|ng the &s;avage inhabitants of Congo; alas, the &s;tory is

<P>PAPA in&s;i&s;ts upon one, two, three, four hun|dred taels from the colonel my lover, before he parts with a lock of my hair. Ho, how I wi&s;h the dear creature may be able to produce the money, and pay papa my fortune. The colonel is reckoned the po|lite&s;t man in all Shen&s;i. The fir&s;t vi&s;it he paid at our hou&s;e; mercy, what &s;tooping, and cringing, and &s;top|ping, and fidgeting, and going back, and creeping forward, there was between him and papa, one would have thought he had got the &s;eventeen books of ceremonies all by heart. When he was come into the hall he flou|ri&s;hed his hands three times in a very graceful manner. Papa, who would not be out-done, flouri&s;hed his four times; upon this the colonel began again, and both thus continued flouri&s;hing for &s;ome minutes in the po|lite&s;t manner imaginable. I was po&s;ted in the u&s;ual place behind the &s;creen, where I &s;aw the whole cere|mony through a &s;lit. Of this the colonel was &s;en&s;ible, for papa informed him. I would have given the world to have &s;hewn him my little &s;hoes, but had no oppor|tunity. It was the fir&s;t time I had ever the happine&s;s, of &s;eeing any man but papa, and I vow my dear Yaya, I thought my three &s;ouls would actually have fled from my lips. Ho, but he looked mo&s;t charmingly, he is reckoned the be&s;t &s;haped man in the whole pro|vince, for he is very fat, and very &s;hort; but even tho&s;e natural advantages are improved by his dre&s;s, which is fa&s;hionable pa&s;t de&s;cription. His head was clo&s;e &s;haven, all but the crown, and the hair of that was braided into a mo&s;t beautiful tail, that reaching down to his heels, was terminated by a bunch of yel|low

ro&s;es. Upon his fir&s;t entering the room, I could ea&s;ily perceive he had been highly perfumed with a&s;&s;afoetida. But then his looks, his looks, my dear Yaya, were irre&s;i&s;tible. He kept his eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed on the wall during the whole ceremony, and I &s;incerely believe no accident could have di&s;compo&s;ed his gravity, or drawn his eyes away. After a polite &s;ilence of two hours, he gallantly begged to have the &s;inging women introduced, purely for my amu&s;ement. After one of them had for &s;ome time entertained us with her voice, the colonel and &s;he retired for &s;ome minutes together. I thought they would never have come back; I mu&s;t own he is a mo&s;t agreeable crea|ture. Upon his return, they again renewed the con|cert, and he continued to gaze upon the wall as u&s;ual, when, in le&s;s than half an hour more! Ho, but he retired out of the room with another. He is indeed a mo&s;t agreeable creature.</P>
<P>When he came to take his leave, the whole cere|mony began afre&s;h; papa would &s;ee him to the door, but the colonel &s;wore he would rather &s;ee the earth turned up&s;ide down than permit him to &s;tir a &s;ingle &s;tep, and papa was at la&s;t obliged to comply. As &s;oon as he was got to the door, papa went out to &s;ee him on hor&s;eback; here they continued half an hour bowing and cringing, before one would mount or the other go in, but the colonel was at la&s;t victorious. He had &s;carce gone an hundred paces from the hou&s;e when papa running out halloo'd after him, A good journey. Upon which the colonel returned, and would &s;ee papa into his hou&s;e before ever he would depart. He was no &s;ooner got home than he &s;ent me a very fine pre&s;ent of duck eggs painted of twenty different colours. His

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have always te&s;tified the highe&s;t e&s;teem for the Engli&s;h poets, and thought them not inferior to the Greeks, Romans, or even the Chine&s;e in the art. But it is now thought even by the Engli&s;h them|&s;elves that the race of their poets is extinct, every day produces &s;ome pathetic exclamation upon the deca|dence of ta&s;te and genius. Pega&s;us, &s;ay they, has &s;lipped the bridle from his mouth, and our modern bards attempt to direct his flight by catching him by the tail.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">
Yet, my friend, it is only among the ignorant that &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es prevail, men of true di&s;cernment can &s;ee &s;everal poets &s;till among the Engli&s;h, &s;ome of whom equal if not &s;urpa&s;s their predece&s;&s;ors. The ignorant term that alone poetry which is couched in a certain number of &s;yllables in every line, where a vapid thought is drawn out into a number of ver&s;es of equal length, and perhaps pointed with rhymes at the end. But glowing &s;entiment, &s;triking imagery, conci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion, natural de&s;cription, and modulated periods are full &s;ufficient entirely to fill up my idea of this art, and make way to every pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If my idea of poetry therefore be ju&s;t, the Engli&s;h are not at pre&s;ent &s;o de&s;titute of poetical merit as they &s;eem to imagine. I can &s;ee &s;everal poets in di&s;gui&s;e among them; men furni&s;hed with that &s;trength of &s;oul, &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and grandeur of expre&s;&s;ion, which con&s;titutes the character. Many of the writers of their modern odes, &s;onnets, tragedies or rebu&s;&s;es, it is true, de&s;erve not the name, though they have done nothing but clink rhymes and mea&s;ure &s;yllables for years together: their John&s;ons and Smollets are truly poets; though for aught I know they never made a &s;ingle ver&s;e in their whole lives.</P>
<P>In every incipient language the poet and the pro&s;e writer are very di&s;tinct in their qualifications; the poet ever proceeds fir&s;t, treading unbeaten paths, en|riching his native funds, and employed in new adven|tures. The other follows with more cautious &s;teps, and though &s;low in his motions, trea&s;ures up every u&s;eful or plea&s;ing di&s;covery. But when once all the extent and force of the language is known, the poet
<PB N="175" REF="176">
then &s;eems to re&s;t from his labour, and is at length overtaken by his a&s;&s;iduous pur&s;uer. Both characters are then blended into one, the hi&s;torian and orator catch all the poet's fire, and leave him no real mark of di&s;|tinction except the iteration of numbers regularly returning. Thus in the decline of ancient European learning, Seneca, though he wrote in pro&s;e, is as much a poet as Lucan, and Longinus, though but a critic, more &s;ublime than Apollonius.</P>
<P>From this then it appears that poetry is not di&s;con|tinued, but altered among the Engli&s;h at pre&s;ent; the outward form &s;eems different from what it was, but poetry &s;till continues internally the &s;ame; the only que&s;tion remains whether the metric feet u&s;ed by the good writers of the la&s;t age, or the pro&s;aic numbers employed by the good writers of this, be preferable. And here the practice of the la&s;t age appears to me &s;uperior; they &s;ubmitted to the re&s;traint of numbers and &s;imilar &s;ounds; and this re&s;traint, in&s;tead of dimi|ni&s;hing, augmented the force of their &s;entiment and &s;tile. Fancy re&s;trained may be compared to a fountain which plays highe&s;t by dimini&s;hing the aperture. Of the truth of this maxim in every language, every fine writer is perfectly &s;en&s;ible from his own experience, and yet to explain the rea&s;on would be perhaps as difficult as to make a frigid genius profit by the di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another rea&s;on in favour of the practice of the la&s;t age, to be drawn from the variety of modu|lation. The mu&s;ical period in pro&s;e is confined to a very few changes, the numbers in ver&s;e are capable of infinite variation. I &s;peak not now from the prac|tice
<PB N="176" REF="177">
of modern ver&s;e writers, few of whom have any idea of mu&s;ical variety, but run on in the &s;ame mo|notonous flow through the whole poem; but rather from the example of their former poets, who were to|lerable ma&s;ters of this variety, and al&s;o from a capacity in the language of &s;till admitting various unanticipated mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Several rules have been drawn up for varying the poetic mea&s;ure, and critics have elaborately talked of accents and &s;yllables, but good &s;en&s;e and a fine ear which rules can never teach, are what alone can in &s;uch a ca&s;e determine. The rapturous flowings of joy, or the interruptions of indignation, require accents placed entirely different, and a &s;tructure con&s;onant to the emo|tions they would expre&s;s. Changing pa&s;&s;ions, and numbers changing with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions make the whole &s;ecret of we&s;tern as well as ea&s;tern poetry. In a word, the great faults of the modern profe&s;&s;ed Engli&s;h poets are, that they &s;eem to want numbers which &s;hould vary with the pa&s;&s;ion, and are more employed in de|&s;cribing to the imagination than &s;triking at the heart.</P>

<P>SOME time &s;ince I &s;ent thee, oh holy di&s;ciple of Confucius, an account of the grand abbey or mau&s;oleum of the kings and heroes of this nation. I have &s;ince been introduced to a temple not &s;o antient, but far &s;uperior in beauty and magnificence. In this,
<PB N="177" REF="178">
which is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the empire, there are no pompous in&s;criptions, no flattery paid the dead, but all is elegant and awfully &s;imple. There are however a few rags hung round the walls, which have at a va&s;t expence been taken from the enemy in the pre&s;ent war. The &s;ilk of which they are compo&s;ed when new, might be valued at half a &s;tring of copper money in China; yet this wi&s;e people fitted out a fleet and an army in order to &s;eize them; though now grown old, and &s;carce capable of being patched up into a handkerchief. By this conque&s;t the Engli&s;h are &s;aid to have gained, and the French to have lo&s;t much honour. Is the honour of European nations placed only in tattered &s;ilk?</P>
<P>In this temple I was permitted to remain during the whole &s;ervice; and were you not already acquainted with the religion of the Engli&s;h, you might, from my de&s;cription, be inclined to believe them as gro&s;ly ido|latrous as the di&s;ciples of Lao. The idol which they &s;eem to addre&s;s, &s;trikes like a colo&s;&s;us over the door of the inner temple, which here, as with the Jews, is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t &s;acred part of the building. Its oracles are delivered in an hundred various tones, which &s;eem to in&s;pire the wor&s;hippers with enthu&s;ia&s;m and awe: an old woman who appeared to be the prie&s;te&s;s, was employed in various attitudes, as &s;he felt the in&s;piration. When it began to &s;peak, all the peo|ple remained fixed in &s;ilent attention, nodding a&s;&s;ent, looking approbation, appearing highly edified by tho&s;e &s;ounds, which to a &s;tranger might &s;eem inarticulate and unmeaning.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
When the idol had done &s;peaking, and the prie&s;te&s;s had locked up its lungs with a key, ob&s;erving almo&s;t all the company leaving the temple, I concluded the &s;ervice was over, and taking my hat, was going to walk away with the crowd, when I was &s;topt by the man in black, who a&s;&s;ured me that the ceremony had &s;carcely yet begun! What, cried I, do I not &s;ee almo&s;t the whole body of the wor&s;hippers leaving the church? Would you per&s;uade me that &s;uch numbers who pro|fe&s;s religion and morality, would in this &s;hamele&s;s manner quit the temple before the &s;ervice was con|cluded? you &s;urely mi&s;take; not even the Kalmouks would be guilty of &s;uch an indecency, though all the object of their wor&s;hip was but a joint &s;tool. My friend &s;eemed to blu&s;h for his countrymen, a&s;&s;uring me that tho&s;e whom I &s;aw running away, were only a par|cel of mu&s;ical blockheads, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was merely for &s;ounds, and who&s;e heads were as empty as a fiddle ca&s;e; tho&s;e who remain behind, &s;ays he, are the true Religious; they make u&s;e of mu&s;ic to warm their hearts, and to lift them to a proper pitch of rapture; examine their behaviour, and you will confe&s;s there are &s;ome among us who practi&s;e true devotion.</P>
<P>I now looked round me as he directed, but &s;aw no|thing of that fervent devotion, which he had promi&s;ed; one of the wor&s;hippers appeared to be ogling the com|pany through a gla&s;s; another was fervent not in ad|dre&s;&s;es to heaven, but to his mi&s;tre&s;s; a third whi&s;|pered, a fourth took &s;nuff, and the prie&s;t him&s;elf, in a drow&s;y tone, read over the <HI>duties</HI> of the day.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s my eyes, cried I, as I happened to look to|wards the door, what do I &s;ee; one of the wor&s;hip|pers

fallen fa&s;t a&s;leep, and actually &s;unk down on his cu&s;hon: is he now enjoying the benefit of a trance, or does he receive the influence of &s;ome my&s;terious vi&s;ion! <HI>Alas, alas,</HI> replied my companion, <HI>no &s;uch thing; he has only had the misfortune of eating too hearty a dinner, and finds it impo&s;&s;ible to keep his eyes open.</HI> Turning to another part of the temple, I per|ceived a young lady ju&s;t in the &s;ame circum&s;tances and attitude; &s;trange, cried I, can &s;he too have over|eaten her&s;elf? <HI>O fie,</HI> replied my friend, <HI>you now grow cen&s;orious. She grow drow&s;y from eating too much; that would be profanation! She only &s;leeps now from having &s;at up all night at a brag party.</HI> Turn me where I will then, &s;ays I, I can perceive no &s;ingle &s;ymptom of devotion among the wor&s;hippers, except from that old woman in the corner, who &s;its groaning behind the long &s;ticks of a mourning fan; &s;he indeed &s;eems greatly edified with what &s;he hears. <HI>Aye</HI> replied my friend, <HI>I knew we &s;hould find &s;ome to catch you; I know her; that is the deaf lady who lives in the cloy&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of behaviour in almo&s;t all the wor&s;hippers, and &s;ome even of the guardians, &s;truck me with &s;urprize; I had been taught to be|lieve that none were ever promoted to offices in the temple, but men remarkable for their &s;uperior &s;anctity, learning, and rectitude; that there was no &s;uch thing heard of as per&s;ons being introduced into the church merely to oblige a &s;enator, or provide for the younger branch of a noble family: I expected, as their minds were continually &s;et upon heavenly things, to &s;ee their eyes directed there al&s;o, and hoped from their beha|viour to perceive their inclinations corre&s;ponding with
<PB N="180" REF="181">
their duty. But I am &s;ince informed, that &s;ome are appointed to pre&s;ide over temples they never vi&s;it; and, while they receive all the money, are contented with letting others do all the good.</P>

extended empire, e&s;tabli&s;hed by laws which nature and rea&s;on &s;eem to have dictated. The duty of children to their parents, a duty which nature implants in every brea&s;t, forms the &s;trength of that government which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for time immemorial. Filial obedience is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t requi&s;ite of a &s;tate; by this we be|come good &s;ubjects to our emperors, capable of be|having with ju&s;t &s;ubordination to our &s;uperiors, and grateful dependants on heaven; by this we become fonder of marriage, in order to be capable of exacting obedience from others in our turn: by this we become good magi&s;trates; for early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is the true&s;t le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e who would learn to rule. By this the whole &s;tate may be &s;aid to re&s;emble one family, of which the Emperor is the protector, father, and friend.</P>
<P>In this happy region, &s;eque&s;tered from the re&s;t of mankind, I &s;ee a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes who in general con&s;idered them&s;elves as the fathers of their people; a race of philo&s;ophers who bravely combated idolatry, prejudice, and tyranny, at the expence of their private happine&s;s and immediate reputation.

What European annals can boa&s;t! of a tyrant thus reclaimed to lenity.</P>
<P>When five brethren had &s;et upon the great emperor Gin&s;ong alone; with his &s;abre he &s;lew four of them; he was &s;truggling with the fifth, when his guards coming up were going to cut the con&s;pirator into a thou&s;and pieces. <HI>No, no,</HI> cried the emperor, with a calm and placid countenance, <HI>of all his brothers he is the only one remaining, at lea&s;t let one of the family be &s;uffered to live, that his aged parents may have &s;ome body left to feed and comfort them.</HI></P>
<P>When Haitong, the la&s;t emperor of the hou&s;e of Ming, &s;aw him&s;elf be&s;ieged in his own city by the u&s;urper, he was re&s;olved to i&s;&s;ue from his palace with &s;ix hundred of his guards, and give the enemy battle; but they for&s;ook him. Being thus without hopes, and chu&s;ing death rather than to fall alive into the hands of a rebel, he retired to his garden, conducting his little daughter, an only child in his hand. There, in a private arbour un&s;heathing his &s;word, he &s;tabbed the young innocent to the heart, and then di&s;patching him&s;elf, left the following words written with his blood on the border of his ve&s;t. <HI>For&s;aken by my &s;ubjects,</HI>

France, in &s;pite of the conque&s;ts of Edward the third, and Henry the fifth, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of Charles the fifth and Philip the &s;econd, &s;till remains within its antient limits. Spain, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, the &s;tates of the north, are nearly &s;till the &s;ame. What effect then has the blood of &s;o many thou&s;ands, the de&s;truction of &s;o many cities, produced? Nothing neither great or con&s;iderable. The chri&s;tian princes have lo&s;t indeed much from the enemies of chri&s;tendom, but they have gained nothing from each other. Their princes, be|cau&s;e they preferred ambition to ju&s;tice, de&s;erve the character of enemies to mankind; and their prie&s;ts by neglecting morality for opinion, have mi&s;taken the in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>On whatever &s;ide we regard the hi&s;tory of Europe, we &s;hall perceive it to be a ti&s;&s;ue of crimes, follies and
<PB N="185" REF="186">
misfortunes, of politics without de&s;ign, and wars with|out con&s;equence; in this long li&s;t of human infirmity, a great character or a &s;hining virtue may &s;ometimes happen to ari&s;e, as we often meet a cottage or a culti|vated &s;pot, in the mo&s;t hideous wilderne&s;s. But for an Alfred, an Alphon&s;o, a Frederic, or one Alexander III. we meet a thou&s;and princes who have di&s;graced humanity.</P>

Ceremonial Academy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>WE have ju&s;t received accounts here, that Vol|taire the poet and philo&s;opher of Europe is dead! He is now beyond the reach of the thou&s;and enemies, who while living, degraded his writings, and branded his character. Scarce a page of his latter pro|ductions that does not betray the agonies of an heart bleeding under the &s;courge of unmerited reproach. Happy therefore at la&s;t in e&s;caping from calumny, happy in leaving a world that was unworthy of him and his writings.</P>
<P>Let others, my friend, be&s;trew the hear&s;es of the great with panegyric; but &s;uch a lo&s;s as the world has now &s;uffered affects me with &s;tronger emotions. When a philo&s;opher dies, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as lo&s;ing a patron, an in&s;tructor, and a friend. I con&s;ider the world as lo&s;ing one who might &s;erve to con&s;ole her amid&s;t the de&s;olations of war and ambition. Nature every day produces in abundance men capable of fill|ing
<PB N="186" REF="187">
all the requi&s;ite duties of authority; but &s;he is nigard in the birth of an exalted mind, &s;carcely pro|ducing in a century a &s;ingle genius to ble&s;s and en|lighten a degenerate age. Prodigal in the production of king's, governors, mandarines, chams, and courtiers, &s;he &s;eems to have forgotten for more than three thou|&s;and years, the manner in which &s;he once formed the brain of a Confucius; and well it is &s;he has forgotten, when a bad world gave him &s;o very bad a recep|tion.</P>
<P>Whence, my friend, this malevolence which has ever pur&s;ued the great even to the tomb; whence this more than fiend-like di&s;po&s;ition of embittering the lives of tho&s;e who would make us more wi&s;e and more happy?</P>
<P>When I ca&s;t my eye over the fates of &s;everal philo|&s;ophers, who have at different periods enlightened mankind, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it in&s;pires me with the mo&s;t degrading reflections on humanity. When I read of the &s;tripes of Mentius, the tortures of Tchin, the bowl of Socrates, and the bath of Seneca; when I hear of the per&s;ecutions of Dante, the impri&s;onment of Galileo, the indignities &s;uffered by Montagne, the bani&s;hment of Carte&s;ius, the infamy of Bacon; and that even Locke him&s;elf e&s;caped not without reproach; when I think on &s;uch &s;ubjects, I he&s;itate whether mo&s;t to blame, the ignorance or the villany of my fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Should you look for the character of Voltaire among the journali&s;ts and illiterate writers of the age; you will there find him characterized as a mon&s;ter, with a
<PB N="187" REF="188">
head turned to wi&s;dom, and an heart inclining to vice; the powers of his mind and the ba&s;ene&s;s of his princi|ples forming a dete&s;table contra&s;t. But &s;eek for his character among writers like him&s;elf, and you find him very differently de&s;cribed. You perceive him in their accounts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good nature, humanity, greatne&s;s of &s;oul, fortitude, and almo&s;t every virtue; in this de|&s;cription tho&s;e who might be &s;uppos'd be&s;t acquainted with his character are unanimous. The royal Pru&s;|&s;ian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophe &s;ans &s;ouci.</NOTE>, D'argens<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Let. Chin.</NOTE>, Diderot<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Encycloped.</NOTE>, D'alambert, and Fonte|nelle con&s;pire in drawing the picture, in de&s;cribing the friend of man and the patron of every ri&s;ing genius.</P>
<P>An inflexible per&s;everance in what he thought was right, and a generous dete&s;tation of flattery, formed the ground-work of this great man's character. From the&s;e principles many &s;trong virtues and few faults a|ro&s;e; as he was warm in his friend&s;hip, and &s;evere in re&s;entment, all that mention him &s;eem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame qualities, and &s;peak of him with rapture or dete&s;|tation. A per&s;on of his eminence can have few indif|ferent as to his character; every reader mu&s;t be an enemy or an admirer.</P>
<P>This poet began the cour&s;e of glory &s;o early as the age of eighteen, and even then was author of a trage|dy which de&s;erves applau&s;e; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall pa|trimony he pre&s;erved his independance, in an age of venality, and &s;upported the dignity of learning, by teaching his cotemporary writers to live like him, above the favours of the great. He was bani&s;hed his native country for a &s;atire upon the royal concubine. He had
<PB N="188" REF="189">
accepted the place of hi&s;torian to the French king, but refu&s;ed to keep it, when he found it was pre&s;ented only in order that he &s;hould be the fir&s;t flatterer of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The great Pru&s;&s;ian received him as an ornament to his kingdom, and had &s;en&s;e enough to value his friend|&s;hip, and profit by his in&s;tructions. In this court he continued till an intrigue, with which the world &s;eems hitherto unacquainted, obliged him to quit that coun|try. His own happine&s;s, the happine&s;s of the mon|arch, <HI>of his &s;i&s;ter,</HI> of a part of the court, rendered his departure nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Tired at length of courts, and all the follies of the great, he retired to Switzerland, a country of liberty, where he enjoyed tranquillity and the mu&s;e. Here, though without any ta&s;te for magnificence him&s;elf, he u&s;ually entertained at his table the learned and polite of Europe, who were attracted by a de&s;ire of &s;eeing a per&s;on from whom they had received &s;o much &s;atis|faction. The entertainment was conducted with the utmo&s;t elegance, and the conver&s;ation was that of phi|lo&s;ophers. Every country that at once united liberty and &s;cience, were his peculiar favourites. The being an Engli&s;hman was to him a character that claimed ad|miration and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Between Voltaire and the di&s;ciples of Confucius, there are many differences; however, being of a dif|ferent opinion does not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h my e&s;teem; I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with my brother, becau&s;e he hap|pens to a&s;k our father for favours in a different man|ner from me. Let his errors re&s;t in peace, his excel|lencies
<PB N="189" REF="190">
de&s;erve admiration; let me with the wi&s;e admire his wi&s;dom; let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foibles; the folly of others is ever mo&s;t ridiculous to tho&s;e who are them&s;elves mo&s;t fooli&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo, a &s;lave in Per&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to form a philo&s;ophic &s;y&s;tem of happine&s;s which is adapted to every condition in life, &s;ince every per&s;on who travels in this great pur|&s;uit takes a &s;eparate road. The differing colours which &s;uit different complections, are not more various than the different plea&s;ures appropriated to particular minds. The various &s;ects who have pretended to give le&s;&s;ons to in&s;truct men in happine&s;s, have de&s;cribed their own particular &s;en&s;ations without con&s;idering ours, have only loaded their di&s;ciples with con&s;traint, without add|ing to their real felicity.</P>
<P>If I find plea&s;ure in dancing, how ridiculous would it be in me to pre&s;cribe &s;uch an amu&s;ement for the en|tertainment of a cripple; &s;hould he, on the other hand, place his chief delight in painting, yet would he be ab&s;urd in recommending the &s;ame reli&s;h to one, who had lo&s;t the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing colours. General directions are therefore commonly u&s;ele&s;s; and to be particular would exhau&s;t volumes, &s;ince each indivi|dual may require a peculiar &s;y&s;tem of precepts to direct his choice.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
Every mind &s;eems capable of entertaining a certain, quantity of happine&s;s, which no in&s;titutions can en|crea&s;e, no circum&s;tances alter, and entirely indepen|dent on fortune. Let any man compare his pre&s;ent fortune with the pa&s;t, and he will probably find him|&s;elf, upon the whole, neither better nor wor&s;e than formerly.</P>
<P>Gratified ambition, or irreparable calamity may produce tran&s;ient &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or di&s;tre&s;s. Tho&s;e &s;torms may di&s;compo&s;e in proportion as they are &s;trong, or the mind is pliant to their impre&s;&s;ion. But the &s;oul, though at fir&s;t lifted up by the event, is every day ope|rated upon with dimini&s;h'd influence; and at length &s;ub&s;ides into the level of its u&s;ual tranquillity. Should &s;ome unexpected turn of fortune take thee from fet|ters, and place thee on a throne, exultation would be natural upon the change; but the temper, like the face, would &s;oon re&s;ume its native &s;erenity.</P>
<P>Every wi&s;h therefore which leads us to expect hap|pine&s;s &s;omewhere el&s;e but where we are, every in&s;ti|tution which teaches us that we &s;hould be better, by being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;omething new, which promi&s;es to lift us a &s;tep higher than we are, only lays a founda|tion for unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e it contracts debts which it cannot repay; it calls that a good, which when we have found it, will in fact add nothing to our happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To enjoy the pre&s;ent, without regret for the pa&s;t, or &s;olicitude for the future, has been the advice rather of poets than philo&s;ophers. And yet the precept &s;eems more rational than is generally imagined. It is the only
<PB N="191" REF="192">
general precept re&s;pecting the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s, that can be applied with propriety to every condition of life. The man of plea&s;ure, the man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the philo&s;opher are equally intere&s;ted in its di&s;qui|&s;ition. If we do not find happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent mo|ment, in what &s;hall we find it? Either in reflecting on the pa&s;t, or progno&s;ticating the future. But let us &s;ee how the&s;e are capable of producing &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A remembrance of what is pa&s;t, and an anticipation of what is to come, &s;eem to be the two faculties by which man differs mo&s;t from other animals. Though brutes enjoy them in a limited degree, yet their whole life &s;eems taken up in the pre&s;ent, regardle&s;s of the pa&s;t and the future. Man, on the contrary, endeavours to derive his happine&s;s, and experiences mo&s;t of his mi&s;e|ries from the&s;e two &s;ources.</P>
<P>Is this &s;uperiority of reflection a prerogative of which we &s;hould boa&s;t, and for which we &s;hall thank nature; or is it a misfortune of which we &s;hould complain and be humble. Either from the abu&s;e, or from the nature of things, it certainly makes our condition more mi&s;e|rable.</P>
<P>Had we a privilege of calling up, by the power of memory, only &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as were plea&s;ing, unmixed with &s;uch as were di&s;agreeable, we might then excite at plea&s;ure an ideal happine&s;s, perhaps more poignant than actual &s;en&s;ation. But this is not the ca&s;e; the pa&s;t is never repre&s;ented without &s;ome di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance, which tarni&s;hes all its beauty; the re|membrance of an evil carries in it nothing agreeable, and to remember a good is always accompanied with
<PB N="192" REF="193">
regret. Thus we lo&s;e more than we gain by remem|brance.</P>
<P>And we &s;hall find our expectation of the future to be a gift more di&s;tre&s;sful even than the former. To fear an approaching evil is certainly a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en|&s;ation; and in expecting an approaching good, we ex|perience the inquietude of wanting actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, whichever way we look, the pro&s;pect is di&s;|agreeable. Behind, we have left plea&s;ures we &s;hall ne|ver more enjoy, and therefore regret; and before, we &s;ee plea&s;ures which we langui&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and are con|&s;equently unea&s;y till we po&s;&s;e&s;s them. Was there any method of &s;eizing the pre&s;ent, unimbittered by &s;uch reflections, then would our &s;tate be tolerably ea&s;y.</P>
<P>This, indeed, is the endeavour of all mankind, who untutored by philo&s;ophy, pur&s;ue as much as they can a life of amu&s;ement and di&s;&s;ipation. Every rank in life, and every &s;ize of under&s;tanding, &s;eems to follow this alone; or not pur&s;uing it, deviates from happine&s;s. The man of plea&s;ure pur&s;ues di&s;&s;ipation by profe&s;&s;ion; the man of bu&s;ine&s;s pur&s;ues it not le&s;s, as every volun|tary labour he undergoes is only di&s;&s;ipation in di&s;gui&s;e. The philo&s;opher him&s;elf, even while he rea&s;ons upon the &s;ubject, does it unknowingly with a view of di&s;&s;i|pating the thoughts of what he was, or what he mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject therefore comes to this. Which is the mo&s;t perfect &s;ort of di&s;&s;ipation: plea&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s, or philo&s;ophy; which be&s;t &s;erves to exclude tho&s;e un|ea&s;y
<PB N="193" REF="194">
&s;en&s;ations, which <HI>memory</HI> or <HI>anticipation</HI> pro|duce.</P>
<P>The enthu&s;ia&s;m of plea&s;ure charms only by intervals. The highe&s;t rapture la&s;ts only for a moment, and all the &s;en&s;es &s;eem &s;o combined, as to be &s;oon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them. It is only among the poets we hear of men changing to one delight, when &s;atiated with another. In nature, it is very different: the glutton, when &s;ated with the full meal, is unqualified to feel the real plea&s;ure of drink|ing; the drunkard in turn finds few of tho&s;e tran&s;ports which lovers boa&s;t in enjoyment; and the lover, when cloyed, finds a diminution of every other appetite. Thus, after a full indulgence of any one &s;en&s;e, the man of plea&s;ure finds a languor in all, is placed in a cha&s;in between pa&s;t and expected enjoyment, perceives an in|terval which mu&s;t be filled up. The pre&s;ent can give no &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e he has already robbed it of eve|ry charm; a mind thus left without immediate em|ployment, naturally recurs to the pa&s;t or the future: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be &s;o now; he &s;ees that he may yet be hap|py, and wi&s;hes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is mi&s;erable, except that very &s;hort one of immediate gratification. In&s;tead of a life of di&s;|&s;ipation, none has more frequent conver&s;ations with di&s;agreeable <HI>&s;elf</HI> than he: his enthu&s;ia&s;ms are but few and tran&s;ient; his appetites, like angry creditors, con|tinually making fruitle&s;s demands for what he is unable to pay; and the greater his former plea&s;ure, the more &s;trong his regret, the more impatient his expectations; a life of plea&s;ure is therefore the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing life in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">
Habit has rendered the man of bu&s;ine&s;s more cool in his de&s;ires, he finds le&s;s regret for pa&s;t plea&s;ures, and le&s;s &s;olicitude for tho&s;e to come. The life he now leads, tho' tainted in &s;ome mea&s;ure with hope, is yet not afflicted &s;o &s;trongly with regret, and is le&s;s divided between &s;hort-lived rapture and la&s;ting angui&s;h. The plea&s;ures he has enjoyed are not &s;o vivid, and tho&s;e he has to expect cannot con&s;equently create &s;o much anxiety.</P>
<P>The philo&s;opher, who extends his regard to all mankind, mu&s;t have &s;till a &s;maller concern for what has already affected, or may hereafter affect him&s;elf; the concerns of others make his whole &s;tudy, and that &s;tudy is his plea&s;ure; and this plea&s;ure is continuing in its nature becau&s;e it can be changed at will, leaving but few of the&s;e anxious intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation. The philo&s;opher by this means leads a life of almo&s;t continued di&s;&s;ipation; and reflection, which makes the unea&s;ine&s;s and mi&s;ery of others, &s;erves as a companion and in&s;tructor to him.</P>
<P>In a word, po&s;itive happine&s;s is con&s;titutional, and in|capable of increa&s;e; mi&s;ery is artificial, and generally proceeds from our folly. Philo&s;ophy can add to our happine&s;s in no other manner, but by dimini&s;hing our mi&s;ery: it &s;hould not pretend to encrea&s;e our pre&s;ent &s;tock, but make us oeconomi&s;ts of what we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The great &s;ource of calamity lies in regret or anti|cipation: he, therefore, is mo&s;t wi&s;e who thinks of the pre&s;ent alone, regardle&s;s of the pa&s;t or the future. This is impo&s;&s;ible to the man of plea&s;ure; it is difficult to the man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and is in &s;ome mea&s;ure at|tainable by the philo&s;opher. Happy were we all born

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the
Ceremonial Academy, at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the frequent invitations I receive from men of di&s;tinction here might excite the vanity of &s;ome, I am quite mortified however when I con&s;ider the motives that in&s;pire their civility. I am &s;ent for not to be treated as a friend, but to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity; not to be entertained &s;o much as wondered at; the fame earne&s;tne&s;s which excites them to &s;ee a Chine&s;e, would have made them equally proud of a vi&s;it from the rhinoceros.</P>
<P>From the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, this people &s;eem fond of &s;ights and mon&s;ters. I am told of a per&s;on here who gets a very comfortable livelihood by making wonders, and then &s;elling or &s;hewing them to the peo|ple for money, no matter how in&s;ignificant they were in the beginning; by locking them up clo&s;e, and &s;hew|ing for money, they &s;oon became prodigies! His fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in this way was to exhibit him&s;elf as a wax-work figure behind a gla&s;s door at a puppet &s;how. Thus keeping the &s;pectators at a proper di&s;tance, and having his head adorned with a copper crown, he looked ex|treamly <HI>natural, and very like the life it&s;elf.</HI> He con|tinued this exhibition with &s;ucce&s;s, till an involuntary fit of &s;neezing brought him to life before all the &s;pecta|tors, and con&s;equently rendered him for that time as
<PB N="196" REF="197">
entirely u&s;ele&s;s, as the peaceable inhabitant of a cata|comb.</P>
<P>Determined to act the &s;tatue no more, he next le|vied contributions under the figure of an Indian king; and by painting his face, and counterfeiting the &s;avage howl, he frighted &s;everal ladies and children with ama|zing &s;ucce&s;s: in this manner therefore he might have lived very comfortably, had he not been arre&s;ted for a debt that was contracted when he was the figure in wax-work: thus his face underwent an involuntary ablution, and he found him&s;elf reduced to his primitive complexion and indigence.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, being freed from gaol, he was now grown wi&s;er, and in&s;tead of making him&s;elf a wonder, was re&s;olved only to make wonders. He learned the art of pa&s;ting up mummies; was never at a lo&s;s for an artificial <HI>lu&s;us naturae;</HI> nay, it has been reported, that he has &s;old &s;even petrified lob&s;ters of his own manu|facture to a noted collector of rarities; but this the learned Cracovius Putridus has undertaken to refute in a very elaborate di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>His la&s;t wonder was nothing more than an halter, yet by this halter he gained more than by all his former exhibitions. The people, it &s;eems, had got it in their heads, that a certain noble criminal was to be hanged with a &s;ilken rope. Now there was nothing they &s;o much de&s;ired to &s;ee as this very rope; and he was re|&s;olved to gratify their curio&s;ity: he therefore got one made, not only of &s;ilk, but to render it the more &s;tri|king, &s;everal threads of gold were intermixed. The people paid their money only to &s;ee &s;ilk, but were
<PB N="197" REF="198">
highly &s;atisfied when they found it was mixed with gold into the bargain. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to men|tion, that the projector &s;old his &s;ilken-rope for almo&s;t what it had co&s;t him, as &s;oon as the criminal was known to be hanged in hempen materials.</P>
<P>By their fondne&s;s of &s;ights, one would be apt to ima|gine, that in&s;tead of de&s;iring to &s;ee things as they &s;hould be, they are rather &s;olicitous of &s;eeing them as they ought not to be. A cat with four legs is di&s;regarded, though never &s;o u&s;eful; but if it has but two, and is con&s;equently incapable of catching mice, it is reckoned ine&s;timable, and every man of ta&s;te is ready to rai&s;e the auction. A man, though in his per&s;on faultle&s;s as an aerial genius, might &s;tarve; but if &s;tuck over with hi|deous warts like a porcupine, his fortune is made for ever, and he may propagate the breed with impunity and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>A good woman in my neighbourhood, who was bred an habit-maker, though &s;he handled her needle tolerably well, could &s;carcely get employment. But being obliged by an accident to have both her hands cut off from the elbows, what would in another coun|try have been her ruin, made her fortune here, &s;he now was thought more fit for her trade than before; bu&s;i|ne&s;s flowed in apace, and all people paid for &s;eeing the mantua-maker who wrought without hands.</P>
<P>A gentleman &s;hewing me his collection of pictures, &s;topped at one with peculiar admiration; there, cries he, is an ine&s;timable piece. I gazed at the picture for &s;ome time, but could &s;ee none of tho&s;e graces with which he &s;eemed enraptured; it appeared to me the
<PB N="198" REF="199">
mo&s;t paltry piece of the whole collection: I therefore demanded where tho&s;e beauties lay, of which I was yet in&s;en&s;ible. Sir, cries he, the merit does not con|&s;i&s;t in the piece, but in the manner in which it was done. The painter drew the whole with his foot, and held the pencil between his toes: I bought it at a very great price; for peculiar merit &s;hould ever be re|warded.</P>
<P>But the&s;e people are not more &s;ond of wonders than liberal in rewarding tho&s;e who &s;hew them. From the wonderful dog of knowledge at pre&s;ent under the pa|tronage of the nobility, down to the man with the box, who profe&s;&s;es to &s;hew <HI>the mo&s;t imitation of na|ture that was ever &s;een;</HI> they all live in luxury.

<P>A young author, a man of good nature and learning was complaining to me &s;ome nights ago of this mi&s;|placed genero&s;ity of the times. Here, &s;ays he, have I &s;pent part of my youth in attempting to in&s;truct and amu&s;e my fellow creatures, and all my reward has been &s;olitude, poverty, and reproach; while a fellow, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of even the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of fiddling merit, or who has perhaps learned to whi&s;tle double, is rewarded, applauded, and care&s;&s;ed! Prythee, young man, &s;ays I to him, are you ignorant, that in &s;o large a city as this, it is better to be an amu&s;ing than an u&s;eful mem|ber
<PB N="199" REF="200">
of &s;ociety? Can you leap up, and touch your feet four times before you come to the ground? <HI>No Sir.</HI> Can you pimp for a man of quality? <HI>No, Sir.</HI> Can you &s;tand upon two hor&s;es at full &s;peed? <HI>No Sir.</HI> Can you &s;wallow a pen-knife? <HI>I can do none of the&s;e tricks.</HI> Why then, cried I, there is no other prudent means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence left but to apprize the town that you &s;peedily intend to eat up your own no&s;e, by &s;ub|&s;cription.</P>
<P>I have frequently regretted that none of our ea&s;tern po&s;ture ma&s;ters or &s;how men have ever ventured to England. I &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ee that money circu|late in A&s;ia, which is now &s;ent to Italy and France, in order to bring their vagabonds hither. Several of our tricks would undoubtedly give the Engli&s;h high &s;atisfaction. Men of fa&s;hion would be greatly plea&s;ed with the po&s;tures as well as the conde&s;cention of our dancing girls; and ladies would equally admire the conductors of our fire-works. What an agreeable &s;ur|prize would it be to &s;ee a huge fellow with whi&s;kers fla&s;h a charged blunderbu&s;s full in a lady's face, with|out &s;inging her hair, or melting her pomatum. Per|haps when the fir&s;t &s;urprize was over, &s;he might then grow familiar with danger; and the ladies might vie with each other in &s;tanding fire with intrepidity.</P>
<P>But of all the wonders of the ea&s;t, the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and I &s;hould fancy, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, would be the looking-gla&s;s of Lao, which reflects the mind as well as the body. It is &s;aid that the emperor Chu&s;i u&s;ed to make his concubines dre&s;s their heads and their hearts in one of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es every morning; while the lady was at her toilet, he would frequently look over her
<PB N="200" REF="201">
&s;houlder; and it is recorded that among the three hundred which compo&s;ed his &s;eraglio, not one was found who&s;e mind was not even more beautiful than her per&s;on.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but a gla&s;s in this country would have the very &s;ame effect. The Engli&s;h ladies, concu|bines and all, would undoubtedly cut very pretty fi|gures in &s;o faithful a monitor. There, &s;hould we hap|pen to peep over a lady's &s;houlder while dre&s;&s;ing, we might be able to &s;ee neither gaming nor ill nature; nei|ther pride, debauchery, nor a love of gadding. We &s;hould find her, if any &s;en&s;ible defect appeared in the mind, more careful in rectifying it, than plai&s;tering up the irreparable decays of the per&s;on; nay, I am even apt to fancy, that ladies would find more real plea&s;ure in this uten&s;il in private, than in any other bauble im|ported from China, though never &s;o expen&s;ive, or amu&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>UPON fini&s;hing my la&s;t letter I retired to re&s;t, reflecting upon the wonders of the gla&s;s of Lao, wi&s;hing to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one here, and re&s;olved in &s;uch a ca&s;e to oblige every lady with a &s;ight of it for nothing. What fortune denied me waking, fancy &s;up|plied in a dream; the gla&s;s, I know not how, was put into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and I could perceive &s;everal ladies approaching, &s;ome voluntarily, others driven forward
<PB N="201" REF="202">
again&s;t their wills by a &s;et of di&s;contented genii, whom by intuition I knew were their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>The apartment in which I was to &s;how away was filled with &s;everal gaming tables, as if ju&s;t for&s;aken; the candles were burnt to the &s;ocket, and the hour was five o'clock in the morning. Placed at one end of the room, which was of prodigious length, I could more ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h every female figure as &s;he marched up from the door; but gue&s;s my &s;urprize, when I could &s;carce perceive one blooming or agreeable face among the number. This, however, I attributed to the early hour, and kindly con&s;idered that the face of a lady ju&s;t ri&s;en from bed ought always to find a compa&s;&s;ionate advocate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who came up in order to view her intellectual face was a commoner's wife, who, as I af|terwards found, being bred during her virginity in a pawn-broker's &s;hop, now attempted to make up the defects of breeding and &s;entiment by the magnificence of her dre&s;s, and the expen&s;ivene&s;s of her amu&s;ements. Mr. Showman, cried &s;he, approaching, I am told you <HI>has</HI> &s;omething to &s;hew in <HI>that there</HI> &s;ort of magic lan|thorn, by which folks can &s;ee them&s;elves on the in&s;ide; I prote&s;t, as my lord Beetle &s;ays, I am &s;ure it will be va&s;tly pretty, for I have never &s;een any thing like it be|fore. But how; are we to &s;trip off our cloaths and be turned in&s;ide out? if &s;o, as lord Beetle &s;ays, I ab&s;olutely declare off; for I would not &s;trip for the world be|fore a man's face, and &s;o I <HI>tells</HI> his lord&s;hip almo&s;t eve|ry night of my life." I informed the lady that I would di&s;pen&s;e with the ceremony of &s;tripping, and immedi|ately pre&s;ented my gla&s;s to her view.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
As when a fir&s;t-rate beauty, after having with dif|ficulty e&s;caped the &s;mall pox, revi&s;its her favourite mirror, that mirror which had repeated the flattery of every lover, and even added force to the compliment; expecting to &s;ee what had &s;o often given her plea&s;ure, &s;he no longer beholds the cherried lip, the poli&s;hed forehead, and &s;peaking blu&s;h, but an hateful phyz, quilted into a thou&s;and &s;eams by the hand of deformi|ty; grief, re&s;entment, and rage fill her bo&s;om by turns; &s;he blames the fates and the &s;tars, but mo&s;t of all the unhappy gla&s;s feels her re&s;entment. So it was with the lady in que&s;tion; &s;he had never &s;een her own mind before, and was now &s;hocked at its deformity. One &s;ingle look was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity; I held up the gla&s;s to her face, and &s;he &s;hut her eyes; no en|treaties could prevail upon her to gaze once more! &s;he was even going to &s;natch it from my hands, and break it in a thou&s;and pieces. I found it was time therefore to di&s;mi&s;s her as incorrigible, and &s;hew away to the next that offered.</P>
<P>This was an unmarried lady, who continued in a &s;tate of virginity till thirty &s;ix, and then admitted a lover when &s;he de&s;paired of an hu&s;band. No woman was louder at a revel than &s;he, perfectly free-hearted, and almo&s;t in every re&s;pect a man; &s;he under&s;tood ri|dicule to perfection, and was once known even to &s;ally out in order to beat the watch. "Here, you my dear with the outlandi&s;h face, (&s;aid &s;he addre&s;&s;ing me) let me take a &s;ingle peep. Not that I care three dams what figure I may cut in the gla&s;s of &s;uch an old fa&s;hioned creature; if I am allowed the beauties of the face by people of fa&s;hion, I know the world will be complai|&s;ant enough to to&s;s me the beauties of the mind into
<PB N="203" REF="204">
the bargain." I held my gla&s;s before her as &s;he de&s;ired, and mu&s;t confe&s;s, was &s;hocked with the reflection. The lady, however, gazed for &s;ome time with the utmo&s;t complacency; and at la&s;t turning to me with the mo&s;t &s;atisfied &s;mile &s;aid, &s;he never could think &s;he had been half &s;o hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>Upon her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion a lady of di&s;tinction was reluc|tantly hawled along to the gla&s;s by her hu&s;band; in bringing her forward, as he came fir&s;t to the gla&s;s him|&s;elf, his mind appeared tinctured with immoderate jea|lou&s;y, and I was going to reproach him for u&s;ing her with &s;uch &s;everity; but when the lady came to pre&s;ent her&s;elf, I immediately retracted; for alas it was &s;een that he had but too much rea&s;on for his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The next was a lady who u&s;ually teized all her ac|quaintance in de&s;iring to be told of her faults, and then never mended any. Upon approaching the gla&s;s, I could readily perceive vanity, affectation, and &s;ome other ill-looking blots on her mind; wherefore by my advice &s;he immediately &s;et about mending. But I could ea&s;ily find &s;he was not earne&s;t in the work: for as &s;he repaired them on one &s;ide, they generally broke out on another. Thus, after three or four attempts, &s;he be|gan to make the ordinary u&s;e of the gla&s;s in &s;ettling her hair.</P>
<P>The company now made room for a woman of learning, who approached with a &s;low pace and a &s;o|lemn countenance, which, for her own &s;ake, I could wi&s;h had been cleaner. "Sir, cried the lady, flouri&s;h|ing her hand, which held a pinch of &s;nuff, I &s;hall be enraptured by having pre&s;ented to my view a mind with
<PB N="204" REF="205">
which I have &s;o long &s;tudied to be acquainted: but, in order to give the &s;ex a proper example, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that all the company be permitted to look over my &s;houlder." I bowed a&s;&s;ent, and pre&s;enting the gla&s;s, &s;hewed the lady a mind by no means &s;o fair as &s;he had expected to &s;ee. Ill-nature, ill placed pride, and &s;pleen, were too legible to be mi&s;taken. Nothing could be more amu&s;ing than the mirth of her female compa|nions who had looked over. They had hated her from the beginning, and now the apartment ecchoed with an univer&s;al laugh. Nothing but a fortitude like her's could have with&s;tood their raillery: &s;he &s;tood it however; and when the bur&s;t was exhau&s;ted, with great tranquillity &s;he a&s;&s;ured the company, that the whole was a deceptio vi&s;us, and that &s;he was too well acquainted with her own mind to believe any fal&s;e re|pre&s;entations from another. Thus &s;aying, &s;he retired with a fullen &s;atisfaction, re&s;olved not to mend her faults, but to write a critici&s;m on the mental reflector.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, by this time I began my&s;elf to &s;u&s;pect the fidelity of my mirror; for as the ladies appeared at lea&s;t to have the merit of ri&s;ing early, &s;ince they were up at five, I was amazed to find nothing of this good quality pictured upon their minds in the reflec|tion; I was re&s;olved therefore to communicate my &s;u&s;picions to a lady, who&s;e intellectual countenance ap|peared more fair than any of the re&s;t, not having a|bove &s;eventy-nine &s;pots in all, be&s;ides &s;lips and foibles. "I own, young woman, &s;aid I, that there are &s;ome virtues upon that mind of your's; but there is &s;till one which I do not &s;ee repre&s;ented; I mean that of ri|&s;ing betimes in the morning; I fancy the gla&s;s fal&s;e in that particular." The young lady &s;miled at my &s;impli|city;
<PB N="205" REF="206">
and, with a blu&s;h, confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;he and the whole company had been up all night gaming.</P>
<P>By this time all the ladies, except one, had &s;een them|&s;elves &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and di&s;liked the &s;how, or &s;colded the &s;how-man; I was re&s;olved, however, that &s;he who &s;eemed to neglect her&s;elf, and was neglected by the re&s;t, &s;hould take a view; and going up to a corner of the room, where &s;he &s;till continued &s;itting, I pre&s;ented my gla&s;s full in her face. Here it was that I exulted in my &s;ucce&s;s; no blot, no &s;tain, appeared on any part of the faithful mirror. As when the large, unwritten page pre&s;ents its &s;nowy &s;potle&s;s bo&s;om to the writer's hand; &s;o appeared the gla&s;s to my view. Here, O ye daughters of Engli&s;h ance&s;tors, cried I, turn hither and behold an object worthy imitation: look upon the mir|ror now, and acknowledge its ju&s;tice, and this woman's pre-eminence! The ladies obeying the &s;ummons, came up in a groupe and, looking on, acknowledged there was &s;ome truth in the picture, as the per&s;on now re|pre&s;ented had been deaf, dumb, and a fool from her cradle.</P>
<P>Thus much of my dream I di&s;tinctly remember, the re&s;t was filled with chimaeras, enchanted ca&s;tles, and flying dragons as u&s;ual. As you, my dear Fum Hoam, are particularly ver&s;ed in the interpretation of tho&s;e midnight warnings, what plea&s;ure &s;hould I find in your explanation: but that our di&s;tance prevents; I make no doubt, however, but that from my de&s;cription you will very much venerate the good qualities of the Eng|li&s;h ladies in general, &s;ince dreams, you know, go al|ways by contraries.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo, a &s;lave in Per&s;ia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter appears to be little more than a rhap&s;ody of
&s;enti|ments from Confucius. Vid. the Latin tran&s;lation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR la&s;t letters betray a mind &s;eemingly fond of wi&s;dom, yet tempe&s;ted by a thou&s;and va|rious pa&s;&s;ions. You would fondly per&s;uade me that my former le&s;&s;ons &s;till influence your conduct, and yet your mind &s;eems not le&s;s en&s;laved than your body. Knowledge, wi&s;dom, erudition, arts and elegance what are they, but the mere trappings of the mind, if they do not &s;erve to encrea&s;e the happine&s;s of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or? A mind rightly in&s;tituted in the &s;chool of philo&s;ophy, acquires at once the &s;tability of the oak, and the flexi|bility of the o&s;ier. The true&s;t manner of le&s;&s;ening our agonies, is to &s;hrink from their pre&s;&s;ure; is to confe&s;s that we feel them.</P>
<P>The fortitude of European &s;ages is but a dream; for where lies the merit in being in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;trokes of fortune, or in di&s;&s;embling our &s;en&s;ibility; if we are in&s;en&s;ible, that ari&s;es only from an happy con&s;titution; that is a ble&s;&s;ing previou&s;ly granted by heaven, and which no art can procure, no in&s;titutions improve.</P>
<P>If we di&s;&s;emble our feelings, we only artificially en|deavour to per&s;uade others that we enjoy privileges which we actually do not po&s;&s;e&s;s. Thus while we en|deavour to appear happy, we feel at once all the pangs
<PB N="207" REF="208">
of internal mi&s;ery, and all the &s;elf-reproaching con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of endeavouring to deceive.</P>
<P>I know but of two &s;ects of philo&s;ophers in the world that have endeavoured to inculcate that fortitude is but an imaginary virtue; I mean the followers of Con|fucius, and tho&s;e who profe&s;s the doctrines of Chri&s;t. All other &s;ects teach pride under misfortunes; they alone teach humility. Night, &s;ays our Chine&s;e philo|&s;opher, not more &s;urely follows day, than groans and tears grow out of pain; when misfortunes, therefore, oppre&s;s, when tyrants threaten, it is our intere&s;t, it is our duty, to fly even to di&s;&s;ipation for&s;upport, to &s;eek redre&s;s from friend&s;hip, to &s;eek redre&s;s from that be&s;t of friends who loved us into being.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers, my &s;on, have long declaimed again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions, as being the &s;ource of all our mi&s;e|ries; they are the &s;ource of all our misfortunes I own; but they are the &s;ource of our plea&s;ures too: and every endeavour of our lives, and all the in&s;tituti|ons of philo&s;ophy, &s;hould tend to this, not to di&s;&s;em|ble an ab&s;ence of pa&s;&s;ion, but to repel tho&s;e which lead to vice, by tho&s;e which direct to virtue.</P>
<P>The &s;oul may be compared to a field of battle, where two armies are ready every moment to encounter; not a &s;ingle vice but has a more powerful opponent; and not one virtue but may be over-borne by a combina|tion of vices. Rea&s;on guides the bands of either ho&s;t, nor can it &s;ubdue one pa&s;&s;ion but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another. Thus, as a bark on every &s;ide be&s;et with &s;torms, enjoys a &s;tate of re&s;t, &s;o does the mind, when influenced by a ju&s;t equipoi&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, enjoy tranquillity.</P>

I have u&s;ed &s;uch means as my little fortune would admit to procure your freedom.

If we become poor we &s;hall at lea&s;t have the plea&s;ure of bearing poverty together; for what is fa|tigue or famine, when weighed again&s;t friend&s;hip and freedom.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi to ***** merchant in Am&s;terdam.</HEAD>
<P>HAPPENING &s;ome days ago to call at a pain|ter's to amu&s;e my &s;elf in examining &s;ome pictures (I had no de&s;ign to buy) it &s;urpri&s;ed me to &s;ee a young Prince in the working room, dre&s;&s;ed in a painter's apron, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly learning the trade. We in&s;tantly re|membered to have &s;een each other; and, after the u&s;ual compliments, I &s;tood by while he continued to paint on. As every thing done by the rich is prai&s;ed, as princes here, as well as in China, are never without followers, three or four per&s;ons, who had the appear|ance of gentlemen, were placed behind to comfort and applaud him at every &s;troke.</P>
<P>Need I tell, that it &s;truck me with very di&s;agree|able &s;en&s;ations <HI>to &s;ee a youth who, by his &s;tation in life, had it in his power to be u&s;eful to thou&s;ands, thus let|ting his mind run to wa&s;te upon canvas, at the &s;ame time fancying him&s;elf improving in ta&s;te, and filling his rank with proper decorum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">
As &s;eeing an error, and attempting to redre&s;s it, are only one and the &s;ame with me, I took occa&s;ion, upon his lord&s;hip's de&s;iring my opinion of a Chine&s;e &s;croll, intended for the frame of a picture, to a&s;&s;ure him, that a mandarine of China thought a minute acquaintance with &s;uch mechanical trifles below his dignity.</P>
<P>This reply rai&s;ed the indignation of &s;ome, and the contempt of others: I could hear the names of Vandal, Goth, ta&s;te, polite arts, delicacy, and fire, repeated in tones of ridicule or re&s;entment. But con&s;idering that it was vain to argue again&s;t people who had &s;o much to &s;ay, without contradicting them, I begged leave to repeat a fairy tale. This reque&s;t redoubled their laughter; but not ea&s;ily aba&s;hed at the rallery of boys, I per&s;i&s;ted, ob&s;erving that it would &s;et the ab&s;ur|dity of placing our affections upon trifles, in the &s;tronge&s;t point of view, and adding that it was hoped the moral would compen&s;ate for its &s;tupidity. For heaven's &s;ake, cried the great man, wa&s;hing his bru&s;h in water, let us have no morality at pre&s;ent; if we mu&s;t have a &s;tory let it be without any moral. I pre|tended not to hear; and while he handled the bru&s;h, proceeded as follows.</P>
<P>IN the Kingdom of Bonbobbin, which, by the Chi|ne&s;e annal, appears to have flouri&s;hed twenty thou&s;and years ago, there reigned a prince, endowed with every accompli&s;hment which generally di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the &s;ons of kings. His beauty was brighter than the &s;un. The &s;un, to which he was nearly re|lated, would &s;ometimes &s;top his cour&s;e in order to look down and admire him.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
His mind was not le&s;s perfect than his body: he knew all things without having ever read; philo&s;ophers, poets, and hi&s;torians, &s;ubmitted their works to his de|ci&s;ion; and &s;o penetrating was he, that he could tell the merit of a book by looking on the cover. He made epic poems, tragedies, and pa&s;torals, with &s;urpri&s;ing facility; &s;ong, epigram, or rebus, was all one to him, tho' it is ob&s;erved, he could never fini&s;h an acro&s;tic. In &s;hort, the fairy, who pre&s;ided at his birth, had endow|ed him with almo&s;t every perfection, or what was ju&s;t the &s;ame, his &s;ubjects were ready to acknowledge he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them all; and, for his own part, he knew nothing to the contrary. A prince &s;o accompli&s;hed, received a name &s;uitable to his merit; and he was called Bonbenin bonbobbin bonbobbinet, which &s;ignifies <HI>Enlightener of the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>As he was very powerful, and yet unmarried, all the neighbouring kings earne&s;tly &s;ought his alliance. Each &s;ent his daughter, dre&s;&s;ed out in the mo&s;t mag|nificent manner, and with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous retinue imaginable, in order to allure the prince: &s;o that at one time there were &s;een at his court not le&s;s than &s;e|ven hundred foreign prince&s;&s;es of exqui&s;ite &s;entiment and beauty, each alone &s;ufficient to make &s;even hun|dred ordinary men happy.</P>
<P>Di&s;tracted in &s;uch a variety, the generous Bonben|nin, had he not been obliged by the laws of the empire to make choice of one, would very willingly have mar|ried them all, for none under&s;tood gallantry better. He &s;pent numberle&s;s hours of &s;olicitude in endeavour|ing to determine whom he &s;hould chu&s;e; one lady was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every perfection, but he di&s;liked her eye|brows;
<PB N="211" REF="212">
another was brighter than the morning &s;tar, but he di&s;approved her fong whang; a third did not lay white enough on her cheek; and a fourth did not &s;ufficiently blacken her nails. At la&s;t after numberle&s;s di&s;appointments on the one &s;ide and the other, he made choice of the incomparable Nanhoa, queen of the &s;car|let dragons.</P>
<P>The preparations for the royal nuptials, or the envy of the di&s;appointed ladies, needs no de&s;cription; both the one and the other were as great as they could be; the beautiful prince&s;s was conducted amid&s;t admiring multitudes to the royal couch, where after being di|ve&s;ted of every encumbering ornament, &s;he was placed, in expectance of the youthful bridegroom, who did not keep her long in expectation. He came more chearful than the morning, and printing on her lips a burning ki&s;s, the attendants took this as a proper &s;ignal to withdraw.</P>
<P>Perhaps I ought to have mentioned in the beginning that, among &s;everal other qualifications, the prince was fond of collecting and breeding mice, which being an harmle&s;s pa&s;time, none of his coun&s;ellors thought proper to di&s;&s;uade him from: he therefore kept a great variety of the&s;e pretty little animals in the mo&s;t beau|tiful cages enriched with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls, and other precious &s;tones: thus he <HI>innocently</HI> &s;pent four hours each day, in comtemplating their in|nocent little pa&s;times.</P>
<P>But to proceed, the Prince and Prince&s;s were now in bed; one with all the love and expectation, the other with all the mode&s;ty and fear, which is natural to &s;up|po&s;e, both willing, yet afraid to begin; when the
<PB N="212" REF="213">
Prince happening to look towards the out&s;ide of the bed, perceived one of the mo&s;t beautiful animals in the world, a white mou&s;e with green eyes, playing about the floor, and performing an hundred pretty tricks. He was already ma&s;ter of blue mice, red mice, and even white mice with yellow eyes; but a white mou&s;e with green eyes, was what he long endeavoured to po&s;|&s;e&s;s: wherefore leaping from bed with the utmo&s;t im|patience and agility, the youthful Prince attempted to &s;eize the little charmer, but it was fled in a moment; for alas! the mou&s;e was &s;ent by a di&s;contented Prince&s;s, and was it&s;elf a fairy.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the agony of the Prince upon this occa&s;ion. He &s;ought round and round every part of the room even the bed where the Prince&s;s lay was not exempt from the enquiry: he turned the Prin|ce&s;s on one &s;ide and t'other, &s;tripped her quite naked, but no mou&s;e was to be found; the Prince&s;s her&s;elf was kind enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t, but &s;till to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Alas, cryed the young Prince in an agony, how un|happy am I to be thus di&s;appointed; never &s;ure was &s;o beautiful an animal &s;een, I would give half my king|dom and my prince&s;s, to him that would find it. The Prince&s;s though not much plea&s;ed with the latter part of his offer, endeavoured to comfort him as well as &s;he could; &s;he let him know that he had an hundred mice already, which ought to be at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy any philo&s;opher like him. Tho' none of them had green eyes, yet he &s;hould learn to thank heaven that they had eyes. She told him, (for &s;he was a profound mo|rali&s;t) that incurable evils mu&s;t be born, and that u&s;e|le&s;s lamentations were vain, and that man was born to
<PB N="213" REF="214">
mi&s;fortunes; &s;he even entreated him to return to bed, and &s;he would endeavour to lull him on her bo&s;om to repo&s;e; but &s;till the Prince continued incon&s;olable; and regarding her with a &s;tern air, for which his family was remarkable, he vowed never to &s;leep in the royal palace, or indulge him&s;elf in the innocent plea&s;ures of matrimony, till he had found the white mou&s;e with the green eyes.</P>
<P>Prythee, Col. Leech, cried his Lord&s;hip, interrupt|ing me, how do you like that no&s;e; don't you think there is &s;omething of the manner of Rembrandt in it? A prince in all this agony for a white mou&s;e, O ridicu|lous! Don't you think, Major Vampyre, that eye|brow &s;tippled very prettily? but pray what are the green eyes to the purpo&s;e, except to amu&s;e children? I would give a thou&s;and guineas to lay on the colour|ing of this cheek more &s;moothly. But I a&s;k pardon, pray, Sir, proceed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>KINGS, continued I, at that time were different from what they are now; they then never en|gaged their word for any thing which they did not ri|gorou&s;ly intend to perform. This was the ca&s;e of Bonbenin, who continued all night to lament his mi&s;|fortunes to the Prince&s;s, who ecchoed groan for groan. When morning came, he publi&s;hed an edict, offering half his kingdom, and his Prince&s;s, to the per&s;on who
<PB N="214" REF="215">
&s;hould catch and bring him the white mou&s;e with green eyes.</P>
<P>The edict was &s;carce publi&s;hed, when all the traps in the kingdom were baited with chee&s;e; numberle&s;s mice were taken and de&s;troyed; but &s;till the much wi&s;hed for mou&s;e was not among the number. The privy council were a&s;&s;embled more than once to give their advice; but all their deliberations came to nothing; even though there were two complete vermin-killers and three profe&s;&s;ed rat-catchers of the number. Fre|quent addre&s;&s;es, as is u&s;ual on extraordinary occa&s;ions, were &s;ent from all parts of the empire; but though the&s;e promi&s;ed well, though in them he received an a&s;&s;urance, that his faithful &s;ubjects would a&s;&s;i&s;t in his &s;earch with their lives and fortunes, yet with all their loyalty, they failed when the time came that the mou&s;e was to be caught.</P>
<P>The Prince therefore was re&s;olved to go him&s;elf in &s;earch, determined never to lie two nights in one place till he had found what he &s;ought for. Thus quitting his palace without attendants, he &s;et out upon his journey, and travelled through many a de&s;ert, and cro&s;&s;ed many a river, high over hills, and down along vales, &s;till re&s;tle&s;s, &s;till enquiring wherever he came; but no white mou&s;e was to be found.</P>
<P>As one day, fatigued with his journey, he was &s;had|ing him&s;elf from the heat of the mid-day &s;un, under the arching branches of a banana-tree, meditating on the object of his pur&s;uit, he perceived an old woman, hideou&s;ly deformed, approaching him; by her &s;toop, and the wrinkles of her vi&s;age, &s;he &s;eemed at lea&s;t five hundred years old; and the &s;potted toad was not more
<PB N="215" REF="216">
freckled than was her &s;kin. "Ah! prince Bonbenin|bonbobbin bonbobbinet, cried the creature, what has led you &s;o many thou&s;and miles from your own king|dom; what is it you look for, and what induces you to travel into the Kingdom of Emmets?" The prince, who was exce&s;&s;ively complai&s;ant, told her the whole &s;tory three times over; for &s;he was hard of hearing. "Well, &s;ays the old fairy, for &s;uch &s;he was, I promi&s;e to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the white mou&s;e with green eyes, and that immediately too, upon one condition." "One condition, cried the prince in a rapture, name a thou&s;and; I &s;hall undergo them all with plea&s;ure." "Nay, interrupted the old fairy, I a&s;k but one, and that not very mortifying neither; it is only that you in|&s;tantly con&s;ent to marry me."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the prince's confu&s;ion at this demand; he loved the mou&s;e, but he dete&s;ted the bride; he he&s;itated; he de&s;ired time to think upon the propo&s;al; he would have been glad to con&s;ult his friends on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. "Nay, nay, cried the odious fairy, if you demur, I retract my promi&s;e; I do not de&s;ire to force my favours on any man. Here, you my attendants, cried &s;he, &s;tamping with her foot, let my machine be driven up; Barbacela, Queen of Emmets, is not u&s;ed to contemptuous treatment." She had no &s;ooner &s;poken than her fiery chariot appeared in the air, drawn by two &s;nails; and &s;he was ju&s;t going to &s;tep in, when the prince reflected, that now or ne|ver was the time to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the white mou&s;e; and quite forgetting his lawful prince&s;s Nanhoa, falling on his knees, he implored forgivene&s;s for having ra&s;hly rejected &s;o much beauty. This well-timed compli|ment in&s;tantly appea&s;ed the angry fairy. She affected
<PB N="216" REF="217">
an hideous leer of approbation, and, taking the young prince by the hand, conducted him to a neighbouring church, where they were married together in a mo|ment. As &s;oon as the ceremony was performed, the prince, who was to the la&s;t degree de&s;irous of &s;eeing his favourite mou&s;e, reminded the bride of her promi&s;e. "To confe&s;s a truth, my prince, cried &s;he, I my&s;elf am that very white mou&s;e you &s;aw on your wedding night in the royal apartment. I now therefore give you the choice, whether you would have me a mou&s;e by day, and a woman by night, or a mou&s;e by night and a woman by day." Tho' the prince was an excel|lent ca&s;ui&s;t, he was quite at a lo&s;s how to determine, but at la&s;t thought it mo&s;t prudent to have recour&s;e to a blue cat that had followed him from his own domini|ons, and frequently amu&s;ed him with its conver&s;ation, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with its advice; in fact this cat was no other than the faithful Prince&s;s Nanhoa her&s;elf, who had &s;hared with him all his hard&s;hips in this di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>By her in&s;tructions he was determined in his choice, and returning to the old fairy, prudently ob&s;erved, that as &s;he mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible he had married her <HI>only for the &s;ake of what &s;he had,</HI> and not for her per&s;onal qualifications, he thought it would for &s;everal rea&s;ons be mo&s;t convenient, if &s;he continued a woman by day and appeared a mou&s;e by night.</P>
<P>The old fairy was a good deal mortified at her hu&s;|band's want of gallantry, though &s;he was reluctantly obliged to comply; the day was therefore &s;pent in the mo&s;t polite amu&s;ements, the gentlemen talked &s;mut, the ladies laughed, and were angry. At la&s;t the hap|py night drew near, the blue cat &s;till &s;tuck by the &s;ide
<PB N="217" REF="218">
of its ma&s;ter, and even followed him to the bridal apart|ment. Barbacela entered the chamber, wearing a train fifteen yards long, &s;upported by porcupines, and all ever be&s;et with jewels, which &s;erved to render her more dete&s;table. She was ju&s;t &s;tepping into bed to the Prince, forgetting her promi&s;e, when he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing her in the &s;hape of a mou&s;e. She had pro|mi&s;ed, and no fairy can break her word; wherefore a&s;&s;uming the figure of the mo&s;t beautiful mou&s;e in the world, &s;he &s;kipped and played about with an infinity of amu&s;ement. The Prince in an agony of rapture, was de&s;irous of &s;eeing his pretty playfellow move a &s;low dance about the floor to his own &s;inging; he began to &s;ing, and the mou&s;e immediately to perform with the mo&s;t perfect knowledge of time, and the fine&s;t grace and greate&s;t gravity imaginable; it only began, for Nanhoa, who had long waited for the opportunity in the &s;hape of a cat, flew upon it in&s;tantly without re|mor&s;e, and eating it up in the hundredth part of a moment, broke the charm, and then re&s;umed her na|tural figure.</P>
<P>The Prince now found that he had all along been under the power of enchantment, that his pa&s;&s;ion for the white mou&s;e was entirely fictitious, and not the genuine complexion of his &s;oul; he now &s;aw that his earne&s;tne&s;s after mice was an illiberal amu&s;ement, and much more becoming a ratcatcher than a Prince. All his meanne&s;&s;es now &s;tared him in the face, he begged the di&s;creet Prince&s;s's pardon an hundred times. The Prince&s;s very readily forgave him; and both returning to their palace in Bonbobbin, lived very happily toge|ther, and reigned many years with all that wi&s;dom, which, by the &s;tory, they appear to have been po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed

of. Perfectly convinced by their former adven|tures, that <HI>they who place their affections on trifles at fir&s;t for amu&s;ement, will find tho&s;e trifles at la&s;t become their mo&s;t &s;erious concern.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the
Ceremonial Acadamy at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>ASK an Engli&s;hman what nation in the world enjoys mo&s;t freedom, and he immediately an|&s;wers, his own. A&s;k him in what that freedom prin|cipally con&s;i&s;ts, and he is in&s;tantly &s;ilent. This happy pre-eminence does not ari&s;e from the people's enjoying a larger &s;hare in legi&s;lation than el&s;ewhere; for in this particular, &s;everal &s;tates in Europe excell them; nor does it ari&s;e from a greater exemption from taxes, for few countries pay more; it does not proceed from their being re&s;trained by fewer laws, for no people are bur|thened with &s;o many; nor does it particularly con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ecurity of their property, for property is pretty well &s;ecured in every polite &s;tate of Europe.</P>
<P>How then are the Engli&s;h more free (for more free they certainly are) than the people of any other coun|try, or under any other form of government whatever. Their freedom con&s;i&s;ts in their enjoying all the advan|tages of democracy with this &s;uperior prerogative bor|rowed from monarchy, that <HI>the &s;everity of their laws may be relaxed without endangering the con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">
In a monarchical &s;tate, in which the con&s;titution is &s;tronge&s;t, the laws may be relaxed without danger; for though the people &s;hould be unanimous in the breach of any one in particular, yet &s;till there is an <HI>effective</HI> power &s;uperior to the people, capable of en|forcing obedience, whenever it may be proper to in|culcate the law either towards the &s;upport or welfare of the community.</P>
<P>But in all tho&s;e governments, where laws derive their &s;anction from the <HI>people alone,</HI> tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions cannot be overlooked without bringing the con&s;titution into dan|ger. They who tran&s;gre&s;s the law in &s;uch a ca&s;e, are tho&s;e who pre&s;cribe it, by which means it lo&s;es not only its influence but its &s;anction. In every republic the laws mu&s;t be &s;trong, becau&s;e the con&s;titution is feeble, they mu&s;t re&s;emble an A&s;iatic hu&s;band who is ju&s;tly jealous, becau&s;e he knows him&s;elf impotent. Thus in Holland, Switzerland, and Genoa, new laws are not frequently enacted, but the old ones are ob&s;erved with unremit|ting &s;everity. In &s;uch republics therefore the people are &s;laves to laws of their own making, little le&s;s than in unmixed monarchies where they are &s;laves to the will of one &s;ubject to frailties like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In England, from a variety of happy accidents, their con&s;titution is ju&s;t &s;trong enough, or if you will, mo|narchical enough, to permit a relaxation of the &s;everity of laws, and yet tho&s;e laws &s;till to remain &s;ufficiently &s;trong to govern the people. This is the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of civil liberty, of which we can form any idea; here we &s;ee a greater number of laws than in any other country, while the people at the &s;ame time obey only &s;uch as are <HI>immediately</HI> conducive to the intere&s;ts of
<PB N="220" REF="221">
&s;ociety; &s;everal are unnoticed, many unknown; &s;ome kept to be revived and enforced upon proper occa&s;ions, others left to grow ob&s;olete, even without the nece&s;&s;ity of abrogation.</P>
<P>Scarce an Engli&s;hman who does not almo&s;t every day of his life, offend with impunity again&s;t &s;ome ex|pre&s;s law, and for which in a certain conjuncture of circum&s;tances he would not receive puni&s;hment. Ga|ming hou&s;es, preaching at prohibited places, a&s;&s;embled crowds, nocturnal amu&s;ements, public &s;hows, and an hundred other in&s;tances are forbid and frequented. The&s;e prohibitions are u&s;eful; though it be prudent in their magi&s;trates, and happy for their people, that they are not enforced, and none but the venal or mer|cenary attempt to enforce them.</P>
<P>The law in this ca&s;e like an indulgent parent, &s;till keeps the rod, though the child is &s;eldom corrected. Were tho&s;e pardoned offences to ri&s;e into enormity, were they likely to ob&s;truct the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, or endanger the &s;tate, it is then, that ju&s;tice would re&s;ume her terrors, and puni&s;h tho&s;e faults &s;he had &s;o often overlooked with indulgence. It is to this ducti|lity of the laws that an Engli&s;hman owes the freedom he enjoys &s;uperior to others in a more popular govern|ment; every &s;tep therefore the con&s;titution takes to|wards a Democratic form, every diminution of the le|gal authority is, in fact, a diminution of the &s;ubjects freedom; but every attempt to render the govern|ment more popular, not only impairs natural liberty, but even will at la&s;t, di&s;&s;olve the political con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="222">
Every popular government &s;eems calculated to la&s;t only for a time, it grows rigid with age, new laws are multiplying, and the old continue in force, the &s;ubjects are oppre&s;&s;ed, burthen'd with a multiplicity of legal injunctions, there are none from whom to expect redre&s;s, and nothing but a &s;trong convul&s;ion in the &s;tate can vindicate them into former liberty: thus the people of Rome, a few great ones excepted, found more real freedom under their Emperors tho' tyrants, than they had experienced in the old age of the commonwealth in which their laws were become numerous and pain|ful, in which new laws were every day enacting and the old ones executed with rigour. They even refu&s;ed to be rein&s;tated in their former prerogatives, upon an offer made them to this purpo&s;e; for they actually found Emperors the only means of &s;oftening the rigours of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of England is at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;trength of its native oak, and the flexibility of the bending tamari&s;k; but &s;hould the people at any time, with a mi&s;taken zeal, pant after an imaginary freedom, and fancy that abridging monarchy was en|crea&s;ing their privileges, they would be very much mi&s;taken, &s;ince every jewel plucked from the crown of maje&s;ty would only be made u&s;e of as a bribe to cor|ruption; it might enrich the few who &s;hared it among them, but would in fact impoveri&s;h the public.</P>
<P>As the Roman &s;enators by &s;low and imperceptible degrees became ma&s;ters of the people, yet &s;till flattered them with a &s;hew of freedom, while them&s;elves only were free; &s;o is it po&s;&s;ible for a body of men, while they &s;tand up for privileges, to grow into an exube|rance
<PB N="222" REF="223">
of power them&s;elves, and the public become actually dependent, while, &s;ome of its individuals only governed.</P>
<P>If then, my friend, there &s;hould in this country, ever be on the throne a King who through good nature or age, &s;hould give up the &s;malle&s;t part of his prerogative to the people, if there &s;hould come a mi|ni&s;ter of merit and popularity&mdash;But I have room for no more.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was ye&s;terday &s;eated at breakfa&s;t over a pen|&s;ive di&s;h of tea, my meditations were interrupted by my old friend and companion, who introduced a &s;tranger, dre&s;&s;ed pretty much like him&s;elf. The gen|tleman made &s;everal apologies for his vi&s;it, begged of me to impute his intru&s;ion to the &s;incerity of his re|&s;pect, and the warmth of his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>As I am very &s;u&s;picious of my company, when I find them very civil, without any apparent rea&s;on, I an&s;wer|ed the &s;tranger's care&s;&s;es at fir&s;t with re&s;erve; which my friend perceiving, in&s;tantly let me into my vi&s;itant's trade and character, a&s;king Mr. Fudge, whether he had lately publi&s;hed any thing new? I now conjectur|ed that my gue&s;t was no other than a book&s;eller, and his an&s;wer confirmed my &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, Sir, &s;ays he, it is not the &s;ea&s;on; books have their time as well as cucumbers. I would no more

bring out a new work in &s;ummer, than I would &s;ell pork in the dog days. Nothing in my way goes off in &s;ummer, except very light goods indeed.

I have ten new title pages now about me, which only want books to be added to make them the fine&s;t things in nature. Others may pretend to direct the vulgar; but that is not my way; I always let the vulgar direct me; wherever popular clamour ari&s;es, I always eccho the million. For in&s;tance, &s;hould the people in gene|ral &s;ay that &s;uch a man is a rogue, I in&s;tantly give or|ders to &s;et him down in print a villain; thus every man buys the book, not to learn new &s;entiments, but to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his own reflected." <HI>But Sir,</HI> interrupted I, <HI>you &s;peak as if you your&s;elf wrote the books you publi&s;h; may I be &s;o bold as to a&s;k a &s;ight of &s;ome of tho&s;e intended publications which are &s;hortly to &s;urprize the world?</HI> "As to that, Sir, replied the tal|kative book&s;eller, I only draw out the plans my&s;elf; and though I am very cautious of communicating them to any, yet, as in the end I have a favour to a&s;k, you &s;hall &s;ee a few of them.

I &s;oon perceived that his bent was for critici&s;m; and as he was good for nothing el&s;e, &s;up|plied him with pens and paper, and planted him at the beginning of every month as a cen&s;or on the works of others. In &s;hort, I found him a trea&s;ure; no merit could e&s;cape him: but what is mo&s;t remarkable of all, he ever wrote be&s;t and bittere&s;t when drunk." <HI>But are there not &s;ome works,</HI> interrupted I, <HI>that from the very manner of their compo&s;ition mu&s;t be exempt from criti|ci&s;m; particularly &s;uch as profe&s;s to di&s;regard its laws.</HI> "There is no work what&s;oever but he can cri|tici&s;e, replied the book&s;eller; even though you wrote in Chine&s;e he would have a pluck at you. Suppo&s;e you &s;hould take it into your head to publi&s;h a book, let it be a volume of Chine&s;e letters for in&s;tance; write how you will, he &s;hall &s;hew the world you could have written better. Should you, with the mo&s;t local ex|actne&s;s, &s;tick to the manners and cu&s;toms of the coun|try from whence you come; &s;hould you confine your|&s;elf
<PB N="226" REF="227">
to the narrow limits of ea&s;tern knowledge, and be perfectly &s;imple, and perfectly natural, he has then the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to exclaim. He may with a &s;neer &s;end you back to China for readers. He may ob&s;erve, that after the fir&s;t or &s;econd letter the iteration of the &s;ame &s;implicity is in&s;upportably tedious; but the wor&s;t of all is, the public in &s;uch a ca&s;e will anticipate his cen&s;ures, and leave you with all your unin&s;tructive &s;im|plicity to be mauled at di&s;cretion."</P>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> cried I, <HI>but, in order to avoid his indignation, and what I &s;hould fear more, that of the public, I would in &s;uch a ca&s;e write with all the knowledge I was ma&s;ter of. As I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much learning, at lea&s;t I would not &s;uppre&s;s what little I had; nor would I appear more &s;tupid than nature made me.</HI> "Here then, cries the book&s;eller, we &s;hould have you entire|ly in our power; unnatural, unea&s;tern; quite out of character; erroneou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible would be the whole cry; Sir, we &s;hould then hunt you down like a rat." <HI>Head of my father!</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>&s;ure there are but two ways; the door mu&s;t either be &s;hut, or it mu&s;t be open. I mu&s;t either be natural or unnatural.</HI> "Be what you will, we &s;hall critici&s;e you, returned the book&s;el|ler, and prove you a dunce in &s;pite of your teeth. But, Sir, it is time that I &s;hould come to bu&s;ine&s;s. I have ju&s;t now in the pre&s;s an hi&s;tory of China, and if you will but put your name to it as the author, I &s;hall re|pay the obligation with gratitude." <HI>What, Sir,</HI> repli|ed I, <HI>put my name to a work which I have not writ|ten! Never while I retain a proper re&s;pect for the pub|lic and my&s;elf.</HI> The bluntne&s;s of my reply quite abated the ardour of the book&s;eller's conver&s;ation; and, after about half an hour's di&s;agreeable re&s;erve, he with &s;ome ceremony took his leave and withdrew.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>IN all other countries, my dear Fum Hoam, the rich are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their dre&s;s. In Per&s;ia, China, and mo&s;t parts of Europe, tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much gold and &s;ilver, put &s;ome of it upon their cloaths; but in England, tho&s;e who carry much up|on their cloaths, are remarked for having but little in their pockets. A tawdry out&s;ide is regarded as a badge of poverty, and tho&s;e who can &s;it at home, and glote over their thou&s;ands in &s;ilent &s;atisfaction, are general|ly found to do it in plain cloaths.</P>
<P>This diver&s;ity of thinking from the re&s;t of the world which prevails here, I was fir&s;t at a lo&s;s to account for; but am &s;ince informed that it was introduced by an inter|cour&s;e between them and their neighbours the French; who, whenever they came in order to pay tho&s;e i&s;landers a vi&s;it, were generally very well dre&s;&s;ed, and very poor, daubed with lace, but all the gilding on the out&s;ide. By this means laced cloaths have been brought &s;o much into contempt, that at pre&s;ent even their Man|darines are a&s;hamed of finery.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own my&s;elf a convert to Engli&s;h &s;implicity; I am no more for oftentation of wealth than of learn|ing; the per&s;on who in company &s;hould pretend to be wi&s;er than others, I am apt to regard as illiterate and ill bred; the per&s;on who&s;e cloaths are extremely fine, I am too apt to con&s;ider as not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;uperiority of fortune, but re&s;embling tho&s;e Indians
<PB N="228" REF="229">
who are found to wear all the gold they have in the world in a bob at the no&s;e.</P>
<P>I was lately introduced into a company of the be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed men I have &s;een &s;ince my arrival. Upon en|tering the room, I was &s;truck with awe at the gran|deur of the different dre&s;&s;es. That per&s;onage, thought I, in blue and gold, mu&s;t be &s;ome Emperor's &s;on; that, in green and &s;ilver, a Prince of the blood; he, in embroidered &s;carlet, a prime mini&s;ter; all fir&s;t rate no|blemen, I &s;uppo&s;e, and well looking noblemen too. I &s;ate for &s;ome time with that unea&s;ine&s;s with con&s;cious inferiority produces in the ingenuous mind, all atten|tion to their di&s;cour&s;e. However, I found their conver|&s;ation more vulgar than I could have expected from per|&s;onages of &s;uch di&s;tinction: if the&s;e, thought I to my|&s;elf, be Princes, they are the mo&s;t &s;tupid Princes I have ever conver&s;ed with: yet &s;till I continued to venerate their dre&s;s; for dre&s;s has a kind of mechanical influ|ence on the mind.</P>
<P>My friend in black indeed did not behave with the &s;ame deference, but contradicted the fine&s;t of them all in the mo&s;t peremptory tones of contempt. But I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">carce time to wonder at the imprudence of his con|duct, when I found occa&s;ion to be equally &s;urprized at the ab&s;urdity of theirs; for upon the entry of a middle-aged man, dre&s;&s;ed in a cap, dirty &s;hirt and boots, the whole circle &s;eemed dimini&s;hed of their former im|portance, and contended who &s;hould be fir&s;t to pay their obey&s;ance to the &s;tranger. They &s;omewhat re|&s;embled a circle of Kalmucs offering incen&s;e to a bear.</P>
<P>Eager to know the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;eeming con|tradiction, I whi&s;pered my friend out of the room, and
<PB N="229" REF="230">
found that the augu&s;t company con&s;i&s;ted of no other than a dancing ma&s;ter, two fiddlers, and a third rate actor, all a&s;&s;embled in order to make a &s;et at country dances, as the middle-aged gentleman whom I &s;aw en|ter was a &s;quire from the country, and de&s;irous of learn|ing the new manner of footing and &s;moothing up the rudiments of his rural minuet.</P>
<P>I was no longer &s;urprized at the authority which my friend a&s;&s;umed among them, nay, was even di&s;plea&s;ed (pardon my ea&s;tern education) that he had not kicked every creature of them down &s;tairs. "What, &s;aid I, &s;hall a &s;et of &s;uch paltry fellows dre&s;s them&s;elves up like &s;ons of kings, and claim even the tran&s;itory re|&s;pect of half an hour. There &s;hould be &s;ome law to re|&s;train &s;o manife&s;t a breach of privilege; they &s;hould go from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, as in China, with the in&s;tru|ments of their profe&s;&s;ion &s;trung round their necks; by this means we might be able to di&s;tingui&s;h and treat them in a &s;tile of becoming contempt." Hold, my friend, replied my companion, were your reformation to take place, as dancing ma&s;ters and fiddlers now mimic gen|tlemen in appearance, we &s;hould then find our fine gen|tlemen conforming to theirs. A beau might be intro|duced to a lady of fa&s;hion with a fiddle ca&s;e hanging at his neck by a red ribbon; and, in&s;tead of a cane, might carry a fiddle &s;tick. Tho' to be as dull as a fir&s;t rate dancing ma&s;ter might be u&s;ed with proverbial ju&s;tice; yet, dull as he is, many a fine gentleman &s;ets him up as the proper &s;tandard of politene&s;s, copies not only the pert vivacity of his air, but the flat in&s;ipidity of his con|ver&s;ation. In &s;hort, if you make a law again&s;t danc|ing ma&s;ters imitating the fine gentleman, you &s;hould
<PB N="230" REF="231">
with as much rea&s;on enact, that no fine gentleman &s;hall imitate the dancing ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>After I had left my friend, I made towards home, reflecting as I went upon the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing men by their appearance. Invited, however, by the fre&s;hne&s;s of the evening, I did not return directly, but went to ruminate on what had pa&s;&s;ed in a pub|lic garden belonging to the city. Here, as I &s;ate up|on one of the benches, and felt the plea&s;ing &s;ym|pathy which nature in bloom in&s;pires, a di&s;con&s;olate figure, who &s;ate on the other end of the feat, &s;eem|ed no way to enjoy the &s;erenity of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>His dre&s;s was mi&s;erable beyond de&s;cription: a thread|bare coat of the rude&s;t materials; a &s;hirt, though clean, yet extremely coar&s;e; hair that &s;eemed to have been long uncon&s;cious of the comb; and all the re&s;t of his equipage impre&s;&s;ed with the marks of genuine poverty.</P>
<P>As he continued to &s;igh, and te&s;tify every &s;ymptom of de&s;pair, I was naturally led, from a motive of hu|manity, to offer comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You know my heart; and that all who are mi&s;erable may claim a place there. The pen&s;ive &s;tranger at fir&s;t declined any conver&s;ation; but at la&s;t perceiving a peculiarity in my accent and manner of thinking, he began to unfold him&s;elf by degrees.</P>
<P>I now found that he was not &s;o very mi&s;erable as he at fir&s;t appeared; upon my offering him a &s;mall piece of money, he refu&s;ed my favour, yet without appear|ing di&s;plea&s;ed at my intended genero&s;ity. It is true he &s;ometimes interrupted the conver&s;ation with a &s;igh, and
<PB N="231" REF="232">
talked pathetically of neglected merit; yet &s;till I could perceive a &s;erenity in his countenance, that, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, be&s;poke inward content.</P>
<P>Upon a pau&s;e in the conver&s;ation I was going to take my leave, when he begged I would favour him with my company home to &s;upper. I was &s;urprized at &s;uch a demand from a per&s;on of his appearance; but willing to indulge curio&s;ity, I accepted his invitation; and though I felt &s;ome repugnance at being &s;een with one who appeared &s;o very wretched, went along with &s;eeming alacrity.</P>
<P>Still as he approached nearer home, his good hu|mour proportionably &s;eemed to encrea&s;e. At la&s;t he &s;topped, not at the gate of an hovel, but of a magni|ficent palace! When I ca&s;t my eyes upon all the &s;ump|tuous elegance which every where pre&s;ented upon en|tering, and then when I looked at my &s;eeming mi&s;era|ble conductor, I could &s;carce think that all this finery belonged to him; yet in fact it did. Numerous &s;er|vants ran through the apartments with &s;ilent a&s;&s;iduity; &s;everal ladies of beauty and magnificently dre&s;&s;ed came to welcome his return; a mo&s;t elegant &s;upper was provided; in &s;hort, I found the per&s;on, whom a little before I had &s;incerely pitied, to be in reality a mo&s;t refined epicure; <HI>One who courted contempt abroad, in order to feel with keener gu&s;t the plea&s;ure of pre-emi|nence at home.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>HOW often have we admired the eloquence of Europe! That &s;trength of thinking, that deli|cacy of imagination, even beyond the efforts of the Chine&s;e them&s;elves. How were we enraptured with tho&s;e bold figures which &s;ent every &s;entiment with force to the heart. How have we &s;pent whole days together in learning tho&s;e arts by which European writers got within the pa&s;&s;ions and led the reader as if by enchantment.</P>
<P>But though we have learned mo&s;t of the rhetorical figures of the la&s;t age, yet there &s;eems to be one or two of great u&s;e here, which have not yet travelled to China. The figures I mean are called <HI>Bawdy</HI> and <HI>Pert|ne&s;s:</HI> none are more fa&s;hionable; none &s;o &s;ure of ad|mirers; they are of &s;uch a nature, that the mere&s;t blockhead, by a proper u&s;e of them, &s;hall have the re|putation of a wit; they lye level to the meane&s;t capa|cities, and addre&s;s tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which all have, or would be a&s;hamed to di&s;own.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, and I believe with &s;ome truth, that it is very difficult for a dunce to obtain the repu|tation of a wit; yet by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the figure <HI>Bawdy,</HI> this may be ea&s;ily effected, and a bawdy block|head often pa&s;&s;es for a fellow of &s;mart parts and pre|ten&s;ions. Every object in nature helps the jokes for|ward, without &s;carce any effort of the imagination. If a lady &s;tands, &s;omething very good may be &s;aid upon that, if &s;he happens to fall, with the help of a little fa|&s;hionable
<PB N="233" REF="234">
Pruriency, there are forty &s;ly things ready on the occa&s;ion. But a prurient je&s;t has always been found to give mo&s;t plea&s;ure to a few very old gentlemen, who being in &s;ome mea&s;ure dead to other &s;en&s;ations, feel the force of the allu&s;ion with double violence on the organs of ri&s;ibility.</P>
<P>An author who writes in this manner is generally &s;ure therefore of having the very old and impotent among his admirers; for the&s;e he may properly be &s;aid to write, and from the&s;e he ought to expect his re|ward, his works being often a very proper &s;uccedaneum to cantharides, or an a&s;&s;afoetida pill. His pen &s;hould be con&s;idered in the &s;ame light as the &s;quirt of an apo|thecary, both being directed at the &s;ame generous end.</P>
<P>But though this manner of writing be perfectly a|dapted to the ta&s;te of gentlemen and ladies of fa&s;hion here, yet &s;till it de&s;erves greater prai&s;e in being equal|ly &s;uited to the mo&s;t vulgar apprehen&s;ions. The very ladies and gentlemen of Benin, or Cafraria, are in this re&s;pect tolerably polite, and might reli&s;h a prurient joke of this kind with critical propriety; probably, too, with higher gu&s;t, as they wear neither breeches nor petti|coats to intercept the application.</P>
<P>It is certain I never could have expected the ladies here, bia&s;&s;ed as they are by education, capable at once of bravely throwing off their prejudices, and not only applauding books in which this figure makes the only merit, but even adopting it in their own conver&s;ation. Yet &s;o it is, the pretty innocents now carry tho&s;e books openly in their hands, which formerly were hid under the cu&s;hion; they now li&s;p their double meanings with
<PB N="234" REF="235">
&s;o much grace, and talk over the raptures they be&s;tow with &s;uch little re&s;erve, that I am &s;ometimes reminded of a cu&s;tom among the entertainers in China, who think it a piece of nece&s;&s;ary breeding to whet the ap|petites of their gue&s;ts, by letting them &s;mell dinner in the kitchen before it is &s;erved up to table.</P>
<P>The veneration we have for many things, entirely proceeds from their being carefully concealed. Were the idolatrous Tartar permitted to lift the veil which keeps his idol from view, it might be a certain method to cure his future &s;uper&s;tition; with what a noble &s;pi|rit of freedom therefore mu&s;t that writer be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, who bravely paints things as they are, who lifts the veil of mode&s;ty, who di&s;plays the mo&s;t hidden rece&s;&s;es of the temple, and &s;hews the erring people that the object of their vows is either, perhaps a mou&s;e, or a monkey.</P>
<P>However, though this figure be at pre&s;ent &s;o much in fa&s;hion; though the profe&s;&s;ors of it are &s;o much care&s;&s;ed by the great, tho&s;e perfect judges of literary excellence; yet it is confe&s;&s;ed to be only a revival of what was once fa&s;hionable here before. There was a time, when by this very manner of writing, the gentle Tom. Durfey, as I read in Engli&s;h authors, acquired his great reputation, and became the favourite of a king.</P>
<P>The works of this original genius, tho' they never travelled abroad to China, and &s;carce have reach'd po&s;|terity at home, were once found upon every fa&s;hionable toilet, and made the &s;ubject of polite, I mean very po|lite conver&s;ation. "<HI>Has your Grace &s;een Mr. Durfey's la&s;t new thing, the Oylet Hole. A mo&s;t facetious piece?</HI>"
<PB N="235" REF="236">
<HI>Sure, my Lord, all the world mu&s;t have &s;een it; Dur|fey is certainly the mo&s;t comical creature alive. It is impo&s;&s;ible to read his things and live. Was there e|ver any thing &s;o natural and pretty, as when the Squire and Bridget meet in the cellar. And then the difficul|ties they both find in broaching the beer barrel are &s;o arch and &s;o ingenious! We have certainly nothing of this kind in the language.</HI>" In this manner they &s;poke then, and in this manner they &s;peak now; for though the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Durfey does not excel him in wit, the world mu&s;t confe&s;s he out-does him in ob&s;cenity.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal very dull fellows, who, by a few mechanical helps, &s;ometimes learn to become extreme|ly brilliant and plea&s;ing; with a little dexterity in the management of the eye-brows, fingers, and no&s;e. By imitating a cat, a &s;ow and pigs; by a loud laugh, and a &s;lap on the &s;houlder, the mo&s;t ignorant are furni&s;hed out for conver&s;ation. But the writer finds it impo&s;&s;ible to throw his winks, his &s;hrugs, or his attitudes upon paper; he may borrow &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance indeed, by print|ing his face at the title page; but without wit to pa&s;s for a man of ingenuity, no other mechanical help but downright ob&s;cenity will &s;uffice. By &s;peaking to &s;ome peculiar &s;en&s;ations we are always &s;ure of exciting laugh|ter, for the je&s;t does not lie in the writer, but in the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>But Bawdry is often helped on by another figure cal|led Pertne&s;s; and few indeed are found to excell in one that are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the other.</P>
<P>As in common conver&s;ation, the be&s;t way to make the audience laugh is by fir&s;t laughing your&s;elf; &s;o in writing, the propere&s;t manner is to &s;hew an attempt at
<PB N="236" REF="237">
humour, which will pa&s;s upon mo&s;t for humour in reality. To effect this, readers mu&s;t be treated with the mo&s;t perfect familiarity: in one page the author is to make them a low bow, and in the next to pull them by the no&s;e: he mu&s;t talk in riddles, and then &s;end them to bed in order to dream for the &s;olution. He mu&s;t &s;peak of him&s;elf and his chapters, and his man|ner, and what he would be at, and his own importance, and his mother's importance with the mo&s;t unpitying prolixity: Now and then te&s;tifying his contempt for all but him&s;elf, &s;miling without a je&s;t, and without wit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing vivacity.</P>

<P>THO' naturally pen&s;ive, yet I am fond of gay company, and take every opportunity of thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the mind from duty. From this motive I am often found in the centre of a crowd; and where|ever plea&s;ure is to be &s;old, am always a purcha&s;er. In tho&s;e places, without being remarked by any, I join in whatever goes forward, work my pa&s;&s;ions into a &s;imilitude of frivolous earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;hout as they &s;hout, and condemn as they happen to di&s;approve. A mind thus &s;unk for a while below its natural &s;tandard, is qua|lified for &s;tronger flights, as tho&s;e fir&s;t retire who would &s;pring forward with greater vigour.</P>
<P>Attracted by the &s;erenity of the evening, my friend and I lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city. Here we &s;auntered to|gether
<PB N="237" REF="238">
for &s;ome time, either prai&s;ing the beauty of &s;uch as were hand&s;ome, or the dre&s;&s;es of &s;uch as had nothing el&s;e to recommend them. We had gone thus deliberately forward for &s;ome time, when &s;topping on a &s;udden, my friend caught me by the elbow, and led me out of the public walk; I could perceive by the quickne&s;s of his pace, and by his frequently looking behind, that he was attempting to avoid &s;omebody who followed; we now turned to the right, then to the left; as we went forward he &s;till went fa&s;ter, but in vain; the per&s;on whom he attempted to e&s;cape, hunt|ed us through every doubling, and gained upon us each moment; &s;o that at la&s;t we fairly &s;tood &s;till, re|&s;olving to face what we could not avoid.</P>
<P>Our pur&s;uer &s;oon came up, and joined us with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance. <HI>My dear Dry|bone,</HI> cries he, &s;haking my friend's hand, <HI>where have you been hiding this half a century? Po&s;itively I had fancied you were gone down to cultivate matrimony and your e&s;tate in the country.</HI> During the reply, I had an opportunity of &s;urveying the appearance of our new companion; his hat was pinched up with peculiar &s;martne&s;s; his looks were pale, thin, and &s;harp; round his neck he wore a broad black ribbon, and in his bo|&s;om a buckle &s;tudded with gla&s;s; his coat was trimmed with tarni&s;hed twi&s;t; he wore by his &s;ide a &s;word with a black hilt, and his &s;tockings of &s;ilk, though newly wa&s;hed, were grown yellow by long &s;ervice. I was &s;o much engaged with the peculiarity of his dre&s;s, that I attended only to the latter part of my friend's reply, in which he complimented Mr. Tibbs on the ta&s;te of his cloaths, and the bloom in his countenance, <HI>P&s;ha, p&s;ha, Will,</HI> cried the figure, <HI>no more of that if you love</HI>

<HI>me, you know I hate flattery, on my &s;oul I do; and yet to be &s;ure an intimacy with the great will improve one's appearance, and a cour&s;e of veni&s;on will fatten; and yet faith I de&s;pi&s;e the great as much as you do; but there are a great many damned hone&s;t fellows among them; and we mu&s;t not quarrel with one half, becau&s;e the other wants weeding. If they were all &s;uch as my lord Mudler, one of the mo&s;t good-natured creatures that ever &s;queezed a lemon, I &s;hould my&s;elf be among the number of their admirers.

<P>Ah, Tibbs, thou art an happy fellow, cried my companion with looks of infinite pity, I hope your for|tune is as much improved as your under&s;tanding in &s;uch company? <HI>Improved,</HI> replyed the other; <HI>You &s;hall know,&mdash;but let it go no further,&mdash;a great &s;ecret&mdash;five hundred a year to begin with.&mdash;My Lord's word of honour for it&mdash;His Lord&s;hip took me down in his own Chariot ye&s;terday, and we had a tete-a-tete dinner in the country; where we talked of nothing el&s;e.</HI> I fancy you forget, &s;ir, cried I, you told us but this moment of your dining ye&s;terday in town! <HI>Did I &s;ay &s;o, replied he, cooly, to be &s;ure if I &s;aid &s;o; it was &s;o&mdash;Dined in town; egad now I do remember, I did dine in town; but I dined in the country too; for you mu&s;t know, my boys, I eat two dinners.

<PB N="239" REF="240">
<HI>nice as the Devil in my eating. I'll tell you a plea&s;ant affair about that, we were a &s;elect party of us to dine at Lady Grogram's, an affected piece, but let it go no farther; a &s;ecret: well, there happened to be no A&s;&s;a|foetida in the &s;auce to a turkey, upon which, &s;ays I, I'll hold a thou&s;and guineas, and &s;ay done fir&s;t, that&mdash;But dear Dry bone, you are an hone&s;t creature, lend me half a-crown for a minute or two, or &s;o, ju&s;t till&mdash;But hearkee, a&s;k me for it the next time we meet, or it may be twenty to one but I forget to pay you.</HI></P>
<P>When he left us, our conver&s;ation naturally turned upon &s;o extraordinary a character. His very dre&s;s cries my friend, is not le&s;s extraordinary than his con|duct. If you meet him this day you find him in rags, if the next in embroidery. With tho&s;e per&s;ons of di|&s;tinction, of whom he talks &s;o familiarly, he has &s;carce a coffee-hou&s;e acquaintance. However, both for in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and perhaps for his own, heaven has made him poor, and while all the world perceive his wants, he fancies them concealed from every eye. An agreeable companion becau&s;e he under&s;tands flattery, and all mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with the fir&s;t part of his con|ver&s;ation, though all are &s;ure of its ending with a de|mand on their pur&s;e. While his youth countenances the levity of his conduct, he may thus earn a precari|ous &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, but when age comes on, the gravity of which is incompatible with buffoonery, then will he find him&s;elf for&s;aken by all. Condemned in the de|cline of life to hang upon &s;ome rich family whom he once de&s;pi&s;ed, there to undergo all the ingenuity of &s;tudied contempt, to be employed only as a &s;py upon the &s;ervants, or a bug-bear to fright the children into obedience.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>I AM apt to fancy I have contracted a new ac|quaintance whom it will be no ea&s;y matter to &s;hake off. My little beau ye&s;terday overtook me again in one of the publick walks, and &s;lapping me on the &s;houlder, &s;aluted me with an air of the mo&s;t perfect familiarity. His dre&s;s was the &s;ame as u&s;ual, except that he had more powder in his hair, wore a dirtier &s;hirt, a pair of temple &s;pectacles, and his hat under his arm.</P>
<P>As I knew him to be an harmle&s;s amu&s;ing little thing, I could not return his &s;miles with any degree of &s;everity; &s;o we walked forward on terms of the utmo&s;t intimacy, and in a few minutes di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the u&s;ual topics preliminary to particular conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The oddities that marked his character, however, &s;oon began to appear; he bowed to &s;everal well dre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, who, by their manner of returning the com|pliment, appeared perfect &s;trangers. At intervals he drew out a pocket book, &s;eeming to take memoran|dums before all the company, with much importance and a&s;&s;iduity. In this manner he led me through the length of the whole walk, fretting at his ab&s;urdities, and fancying my&s;elf laughed at not le&s;s than him by every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>When we were got to the end of our proce&s;&s;ion, <HI>Bla&s;t me,</HI> cries he, with an air of vivacity, <HI>I never &s;aw the park &s;o thin in my life before; there's no company at</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="242">
<HI>all to day. Not a &s;ingle face to be &s;een.</HI> No company, interrupted I peevi&s;hly; no company where there is &s;uch a crowd; why man, there's too much. What are the thou&s;and that have been laughing at us but company! <HI>Lord, my dear,</HI> returned he, with the ut|mo&s;t good humour, <HI>you &s;eem immen&s;ely chagrined; but, bla&s;t me, when the world laughs at me, I laugh at the world, and &s;o we are even. My Lord Trip, Bill Squa&s;h the Creolian, and I &s;ometimes make a party at being ridiculous; and &s;o we &s;ay and do a thou&s;and things for the joke &s;ake. But I &s;ee you are grave, and if you are for a fine grave &s;entimental companion, you &s;hall dine with me and my wife to day, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on't; I'll introduce you to Mrs. Tibbs, a Lady of as elegant qualifications as any in nature; &s;he was bred, but that's between our&s;elves, under the in&s;pection of the Counte&s;s of All-night. A charming body of voice, but no more of that, &s;he &s;hall give us a &s;ong. You &s;hall &s;ee my little girl too, Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Tibbs, a &s;weet pretty creature; I de&s;ign her for my Lord Drum&s;tick's elde&s;t &s;on, but that's in friend&s;hip, let it go no farther; &s;he's but &s;ix years old, and yet &s;he walks a minuet, and plays on the guittar immen&s;ely already. I intend &s;he &s;hall be as perfect as po&s;&s;ible in every ac|compli&s;hment. In the fir&s;t place I'll make her a &s;cholar; I'll teach her Greek my&s;elf, and learn that language purpo&s;ely to in&s;truct her; but let that be a &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, without waiting for a reply, he took me by the arm and hauled me along. We pa&s;&s;ed through many dark alleys and winding ways; for, from &s;ome motives to me unknown, he &s;eemed to have a particular aver&s;ion to every frequented &s;treet; at la&s;t, however, we got to the door of a di&s;mal looking hou&s;e
<PB N="242" REF="243">
in the outlets of the town, where he informed me he cho&s;e to re&s;ide for the benefit of the air.</P>
<P>We entered the lower door, which ever &s;eemed to lie mo&s;t ho&s;pitably open; and I began to a&s;cend an old and creaking &s;tair-ca&s;e, when, as he mounted to &s;hew me the way, he demanded, whether I delighted in pro&s;pects, to which an&s;wering in the affirmative, <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;hall &s;hew you one of the mo&s;t charming in the world out of my windows; we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;hips &s;ailing, and the whole country for twenty miles round, tip top, quite high. My Lord Swamp would give ten thou&s;and guineas for &s;uch a one; but as I &s;ometimes plea&s;antly tell him, I always love to keep my pro&s;pects at home, that my friends may &s;ee me the oftner.</HI></P>
<P>By this time we were arrived as high as the &s;tairs would permit us to a&s;cend, till we came to what he was facetiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call the fir&s;t floor down the chimney; and knocking at the door, a voice from within demanded, who's there? My conductor an&s;wer|ed, that it was him. But this not &s;atisfying the queri&s;t, the voice again repeated the demand: to which he an|&s;wered louder than before; and now the door was opened by an old woman with cautious reluctance.</P>
<P>When we were got in, he welcomed me to his hou&s;e with great ceremony, and turning to the old woman, a&s;ked where was her lady? "Good troth, replied &s;he, in a peculiar dialect, &s;he's wa&s;hing your twa &s;hirts at the next door, becau&s;e they have taken an oath again&s;t lending out the tub any longer." <HI>My two &s;hirts,</HI> cries he in a tone that faultered with confu&s;ion, <HI>what does the ideot mean?</HI> "I ken what I mean well enough, re|plied the other, &s;he's wa&s;hing your twa &s;hirts at the next door, becau&s;e&mdash;" <HI>Fire and fury, no more of thy</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="244"><HI>&s;tupid explanations,</HI> cried he,<HI>&mdash;Go and inform her we have got company. Were that Scotch hag to be for ever in my family, &s;he would never learn politene&s;s, nor forget that ab&s;urd poi&s;onous accent of hers, or te&s;ti|fy the &s;malle&s;t &s;pecimen of breeding or high life; and yet it is very &s;urprizing too, as I had her from a par|liament man, a friend of mine, from the highlands, one of the polite&s;t men in the world; but that's a &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>We waited &s;ome time for Mrs. Tibbs's arrival, dur|ing which interval I had a full opportunity of &s;urvey|ing the chamber and all its furniture; which con&s;i&s;ted of four chairs with old wrought bottoms, that he a&s;|&s;ured me were his wife's embroidery; a &s;quare table that had been once japanned, a cradle, in one corner, a lumbering cabinet in the other; a broken &s;hepherde&s;s, and a mandarine without an head, were &s;tuck over the chimney; and round the walls &s;everal paltry, unframed pictures, which he ob&s;erved, were all his own draw|ing: <HI>What do you think, Sir, of that head in the cor|ner, done in the manner of Gri&s;oni? there's the true keeping in it; its my own face, and though there hap|pens to be no likene&s;s, a counte&s;s offered me an hun|dred for its fellow; I refu&s;ed her, for, hang it, that would be mechanical, you know.</HI></P>
<P>The wife at la&s;t made her appearance, at once a &s;lattern and a coquet; much emaciated, but &s;till car|rying the remains of beauty. She made twenty apolo|gies for being &s;een in &s;uch an odious di&s;habille, but hoped to be excu&s;ed, as &s;he had &s;taid out all night at the gardens with the counte&s;s, who was exce&s;&s;ively fond of the <HI>horns.</HI> "And, indeed, my dear, added &s;he, turning to her hu&s;band, his lord&s;hip drank your health in a bumper." <HI>Poor Jack,</HI> cries he, <HI>a dear good-natured creature, I know he loves me; but I</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="245">
<HI>hope, my dear, you have given orders for dinner; you need make no great preparations neither, there are but three of us, &s;omething elegant, and little will do; a turbot, an ortolan, or a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. Or what do you think, my dear,</HI> interrupts the wife, <HI>of a nice pretty bit of ox cheek, piping hot, and dre&s;&s;ed with a little of my own &s;auce.&mdash;The very thing,</HI> replies he, <HI>it will eat be&s;t with &s;ome &s;mart bottled beer; but be &s;ure to let's have the &s;auce his Grace was &s;o fond of. I hate your immen&s;e loads of meat, that is country all over; extreme di&s;|gu&s;ting to tho&s;e who are in the lea&s;t acquainted with high life.</HI></P>
<P>By this time my curio&s;ity began to abate, and my appetite to encrea&s;e; the company of fools may at fir&s;t make us &s;mile, but at la&s;t never fails of rendering us melancholy. I therefore pretended to recollect a prior engagement, and after having &s;hewn my re&s;pect to the hou&s;e, according to the fa&s;hion of the Engli&s;h, by giv|ing the old &s;ervant a piece of money at the door, I took my leave.

<P>THE di&s;tant &s;ounds of mu&s;ic that catch new &s;weetne&s;s as they vibrate through the long drawn valley, are not more plea&s;ing to the ear than the tidings of a far di&s;tant friend.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received two hundred of thy letters by the Ru&s;&s;ian carravan, de&s;criptive of the manners of Europe. You have left it to geographers to determine
<PB N="245" REF="246">
the &s;ite of their mountains, and extent of their lakes, &s;eeming only employed in di&s;covering the genius, the government, and di&s;po&s;ition of the people.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e letters I perceive a journal of the operations of your mind upon whatever occurs, rather than a detail of your travels from one building to another; of your taking a draught of this ruin, or that obeli&s;k; of paying &s;o many Tomans for this commodity, or laying up a proper &s;tore for the pa&s;&s;age of &s;ome new wilder|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>From your accounts of Ru&s;&s;ia I learn, that this na|tion is again relaxing into pri&s;tine barbarity, that its great Emperor wanted a life of an hundred years more to bring about his va&s;t de&s;ign. A &s;avage people may be re&s;embled to their own fore&s;ts; a few years are &s;uf|ficient to clear away the ob&s;tructions to agriculture; but it requires many ere the ground acquires a proper degree of fertility; the Ru&s;&s;ians, attached to their an|cient prejudices, again renew their hatred to &s;trangers, and indulge every former brutal exce&s;s. So true it is, that the revolutions of wi&s;dom are &s;low and difficult; the revolutions of folly or ambition precipitate and ea&s;y. <HI>We are not to be a&s;toni&s;hed,</HI> &s;ays Confucius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' this fine maxim be not found in the Latin edition of of the morals of Confuciu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, yet we find it a&s;cribed to him by Le Comte.

Vol. I. p. 348.</NOTE>, <HI>that the wi&s;e walk more &s;lowly in their road to virtue, than fools in their pa&s;&s;age to vice; &s;ince pa&s;&s;ion drags us along, while wi&s;dom only points out the way.</HI></P>
<P>The German Empire, that remnant of the Maje&s;ty of ancient Rome, appears from your accounts on the eve of di&s;&s;olution. The members of its va&s;t body want
<PB N="246" REF="247">
every tye of government to unite them, and &s;eem fee|bly held together only by their re&s;pect for an ancient in|&s;titution. The very name of country and countrymen, which in other nations makes one of the &s;tronge&s;t bonds of government, has been here for &s;ome time laid a&s;ide, each of its inhabitants &s;eeming more proud of being called from the petty &s;tate which gives him birth, than by the more well known title of German.</P>
<P>This government may be regarded in the light of a &s;evere ma&s;ter, and a feeble opponent. The &s;tates which are now &s;ubject to the laws of the Empire, are only watching a proper occa&s;ion to fling off the yoke, and tho&s;e which are become too powerful to be com|pelled to obedience, now begin to think of dictating in their turn. The &s;truggles in this &s;tate are therefore not in order to pre&s;erve but to de&s;troy the ancient con|&s;titution; if one &s;ide &s;ucceeds, the government mu&s;t become de&s;potic, if the other, &s;everal &s;tates will &s;ub&s;i&s;t without even nominal &s;ubordination, but in either ca&s;e the Germanic con&s;titution will be no more.</P>
<P>Sweden, on the contrary, though now &s;eemingly a &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertor of its liberties, is probably only ha&s;tening on to de&s;poti&s;m. Their &s;enators, while they pretend to vindicate the freedom of the people, are only e&s;tabli&s;hing their own independance. The de|luded people will however at la&s;t perceive the mi&s;eries of an ari&s;tocratical government; they will perceive that the admini&s;tration of a &s;ociety of men is ever more painful than that of one only. They will fly from this mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive of all forms, where one &s;ingle member is capable of controlling the whole, to take refuge un|der the throne which will ever be attentive to their complaints. No people long endure an ari&s;tocratical
<PB N="247" REF="248">
government, when they could apply el&s;ewhere for re|dre&s;s. The lower orders of people may be en&s;laved for a time by a number of tyrants, but upon the fir&s;t opportunity they will ever take a refuge in de&s;poti&s;m or democracy.</P>
<P>As the Swedes are making concealed approaches to de&s;poti&s;m, the French, on the other hand, are imper|ceptibly vindicating them&s;elves into freedom. When I con&s;ider that tho&s;e parliaments (the members of which are all created by the court, the pre&s;idents of which can act only by immediate direction) pre&s;ume even to mention privileges and freedom, who, till of late, re|ceived directions from the throne with implicit humi|lity; when this is con&s;idered, I cannot help fancying that the genius of freedom has entered that kingdom in di&s;gui&s;e. If they have but three weak monarchs more, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively on the throne, the ma&s;k will be laid a&s;ide, and the country will certainly once more be free.</P>
<P>When I compare the figure which the Dutch make in Europe with that they a&s;&s;ume in A&s;ia, I am &s;truck with &s;urprize. In A&s;ia, I find them the great Lords of all the Indian &s;eas; in Europe the timid inhabitants of a paltry &s;tate. No longer the &s;ons of freedom, but of avarice; no longer a&s;&s;ertors of their rights by courage, but by negotiations; fawning on tho&s;e who in&s;ult them, and crouching under the rod of every neighbouring power. Without a friend to &s;ave them in di&s;tre&s;s, and without virtue to &s;ave them&s;elves; their government is poor, and their private wealth will &s;erve but to in|vite &s;ome neighbouring invader.</P>
<P>I long with impatience for your letters from England, Denmark, Holland, and Italy; yet why wi&s;h for rela|tions which only de&s;cribe new calamities, which &s;hew
<PB N="248" REF="249">
that ambition and avarice are equally terrible in every region.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi, to Fum Hoam, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the
Ceremonial Academy, at Pekin, in China.</HEAD>
<P>I Have frequently admired the manner of critici&s;ing in China, where the learned are a&s;&s;embled in a body to judge of every new publication; to examine the merits of the work without knowing the circum|&s;tances of the author, and then to u&s;her it into the world with the proper marks of re&s;pect or reprobation.</P>
<P>In England there are no &s;uch tribunals erected; but if a man thinks proper to be a judge of genius, few will be at the pains to contradict his preten&s;ions. If any chu&s;e to be critics, it is but &s;aying they are critics; and from that time forward they became inve&s;ted with full power and authority over every caitiff who aims at their in&s;truction or entertainment.</P>
<P>As almo&s;t every member of &s;ociety has by this means a vote in literary tran&s;actions; it is no way &s;ur|prizing to find the rich leading the way here as in other common concerns of life, to &s;ee them either bribing the numerous herd of voters by their intere&s;t, or brow|beating them by their authority.</P>
<P>A great man &s;ays, at his table, that &s;uch a book <HI>is no bad thing.</HI> Immediately the prai&s;e is carried off by five flatterers to be di&s;per&s;ed at twelve different coffee|hou&s;es, from whence it circulates, &s;till improving as it proceeds, through forty-five hou&s;es, where cheaper
<PB N="249" REF="250">
liquors are &s;old; from thence it is carried away by the hone&s;t trade&s;man to his own fire-&s;ide, where the ap|plau&s;e is eagerly caught up by his wife and children who have been long taught to regard his judgment as the &s;tandard of perfection. Thus when we have traced a wide extended literary reputation up to its ori|ginal &s;ource, we &s;hall find it derived from &s;ome great man, who has, perhaps, received all his education and Engli&s;h from a tutor of Berne, or a dancing-ma&s;ter of Picardie.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h are a people of good &s;en&s;e; and I am the more &s;urprized to find them &s;wayed in their opi|nions, by men who often from, their very education, are incompetent judges. Men who being always bred in affluence, &s;ee the world only on one &s;ide, are &s;urely improper judges of human nature; they may indeed, de&s;cribe a ceremony, a pageant or a ball; but how can they pretend to dive into the &s;ecrets of the human heart, who have been nur&s;ed up only in forms, and daily behold nothing but the &s;ame in&s;ipid adulation &s;miling upon every face. Few of them have been bred in that be&s;t of &s;chools, the &s;chool of adver&s;ity; and by what I can learn, fewer &s;till have been bred in any &s;chool at all.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a de&s;cription one would think, that a droning Duke, or a Dowager Duche&s;s, was not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of more ju&s;t preten&s;ions to ta&s;te than per&s;ons of le&s;s quality; and yet whatever the one or the other may write or prai&s;e, &s;hall pa&s;s for perfection, without farther examination. A nobleman has but to take pen, ink, and paper, and write away through three large volumes, and then &s;ign his name to the title page, tho' the whole might have been before more di&s;gu&s;ting than
<PB N="250" REF="251">
his own rent-roll, yet &s;igning his name and title gives value to the deed; title being alone equivalent to ta&s;te, imagination, and genius.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a piece therefore, is publi&s;hed, the fir&s;t que&s;tions are, Who is the author? Does he keep a coach? Where lies his e&s;tate? What &s;ort of a table does he keep? If he happens to be poor and unquali|fied for &s;uch a &s;crutiny, he and his works &s;ink into ir|remediable ob&s;curity; and too late he finds, that hav|ing fed upon Turtle is a more ready way to &s;ame than having dige&s;ted Tully.</P>
<P>The poor devil, again&s;t whom fa&s;hion has &s;et its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, vainly alledges, that he has been bred in every part of Europe where knowledge was to be &s;old; that he has grown pale in the &s;tudy of nature and him&s;elf: his works may plea&s;e upon the peru&s;al, but his preten|&s;ions to fame are intirely di&s;regarded; he is treated like a fidler, who&s;e mu&s;ic, though liked, is not much prai&s;ed, becau&s;e he lives by it; while a gentleman per|former, though the mo&s;t wretched &s;craper alive, throws the audience into raptures. The fidler indeed may in &s;uch a ca&s;e con&s;ole him&s;elf by thinking, that while the other goes off with all the prai&s;e, he runs away with all the money: but here the parallel drops; for while the nobleman triumphs in unmerited applau&s;e, the au|thor by profe&s;&s;ion, &s;teals off with&mdash;<HI>Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>The poor, therefore, here, who draw their pens auxiliary to the laws of their country, mu&s;t think them&s;elves very happy if they find, not fame but for|givene&s;s; and yet they are hardly treated; for as every country grows more polite, the pre&s;s becomes more u&s;eful; and writers become more nece&s;&s;ary, as readers are &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e. In a poli&s;hed &s;ociety, that
<PB N="251" REF="252">
man, though in rags, who has the power of enforcing virtue from the pre&s;s, is of, more real u&s;e than forty &s;tupid brachmans or bonzes or guebres, though they preached never &s;o often, never &s;o loud, or never &s;o long. That man, though in rags, who is capable of deceiving even indolence into wi&s;dom, and who profe&s;&s;es amu&s;ement while he aims at reformation, is more u&s;e|ful in refined &s;ociety than twenty cardinals with all their &s;carlet, and tricked out in all the fopperies of &s;chola&s;tic finery.</P>

<P>Though a vi&s;itation of this nature was very u&s;eful, yet it was found to be extremely trouble ome, and for many rea&s;ons utterly inconvenient; for as the principal prie&s;ts were obliged to attend at court, in order to &s;o|licit preferment, it was impo&s;&s;ible they could at the &s;ame time attend in the country, which was quite out of the road to promotion: if we add to this the gout, which has been time immemorial a clerical di&s;order
<PB N="252" REF="253">
here, together with the bad wine, and ill dre&s;&s;ed pro|vi&s;ions that mu&s;t infallibly be &s;erved up by the way, it was not &s;trange that the cu&s;tom has been long di&s;con|tinued. At pre&s;ent, therefore, every head of the church, in&s;tead of going about to vi&s;it his prie&s;ts, is &s;atisfied if his prie&s;ts come in a body once a year to vi&s;it him; by this means the duty of half a year is di&s;patch|ed in a day. When a&s;&s;embled, he a&s;ks each in his turn how they have behaved, and are liked; upon which, tho&s;e who have neglected their duty, or are di&s;agree|able to their congregation, no doubt accu&s;e them&s;elves, and tell him all their faults; for which, he reprimands them mo&s;t &s;everely.</P>
<P>The thoughts of being introduced into a company of philo&s;ophers and learned men, (for as &s;uch I con|ceived them) gave me no &s;mall plea&s;ure; I expected our entertainment would re&s;emble tho&s;e &s;entimental banquets &s;o finely de&s;cribed by Xenophon and Plato; I was hoping &s;ome Socrates would be brought in from the door, in order to harangue upon divine love; but as for eating and drinking I had prepared my&s;elf to be di&s;appointed in that particular. I was apprized, that fa&s;ting and temperance were tenets &s;trongly recom|mended to the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; and I had &s;een the frugality and mortification of the prie&s;ts of the ea&s;t: &s;o that I expected an entertainment where we &s;hould have much rea&s;oning, and little meat.</P>
<P>Upon being introduced, I confe&s;s I found no great &s;igns of mortification in the faces or per&s;ons of the com|pany. However, I imputed their florid looks to tem|perance, and their corpulency to a &s;edentary way of living. I &s;aw &s;everal preparations indeed for dinner, but none for philo&s;ophy. The company &s;eemed to
<PB N="253" REF="254">
gaze upon the table with &s;ilent expectation; but this I ea&s;ily excu&s;ed. Men of wi&s;dom, thought I, are ever &s;low of &s;peech; they deliver nothing unadvi&s;edly. <HI>Si|lence,</HI> &s;ays Confucius, <HI>is a friend that will never be|tray.</HI> They are now probably inventing maxims, or hard &s;ayings, for their mutual in&s;truction, when &s;ome one &s;hall think proper to begin.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity was now wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch; I impatiently looked round to &s;ee if any were going to interrupt the mighty pau&s;e; when, at la&s;t, one of the company declared, that there was a &s;ow in his neighbourhood that farrowed fifteen pigs at a litter. This I thought a very prepo&s;terous beginning: but ju&s;t as another was going to &s;econd the remark, dinner was &s;erved, which interrupted the conver&s;ation for that time.</P>
<P>The appearance of dinner, which con&s;i&s;ted of a va|riety of di&s;hes, &s;eemed to diffu&s;e new chearfulne&s;s upon every face; &s;o that I now expected the philo&s;ophical conver&s;ation to begin, as they improved in good hu|mour. The principal prie&s;t, however, opened his mouth, with only ob&s;erving, that the veni&s;on had not been kept enough, though he had given &s;trict orders for having it killed ten days before. <HI>I fear,</HI> continued he, <HI>it will be found to want the true beathy flavour; you will find nothing of the original wildne&s;s in it.</HI> A prie&s;t, who &s;ate next him, having &s;melt it and wiped his no&s;e: "Ah, my good lord, cries he, you are too mode&s;t, it is perfectly fine; every body knows that no body under&s;tands keeping veni&s;on with your Lord&s;hip." "Ay, and partridges too, interrupted another; I never find them right any where el&s;e." His Lord|&s;hip was going to reply, when a third took off the
<PB N="254" REF="255">
attention of the company, by recommending the pig as inimitable. "I fancy, my Lord, continues he, it has been &s;mothered in its own blood." "If it has been &s;mothered in its blood, cried a facetious member, help|ing him&s;elf, we'll now &s;mother it in egg &s;auce." This poignant piece of humour produced a long loud laugh, which the facetious brother ob&s;erving, and now that he was in luck, willing to &s;econd his blow, a&s;&s;ured the company he would tell them a good &s;tory about that: "As good a &s;tory, cries he, bur&s;ting into a violent fit of laughter him&s;elf, as ever you heard in your lives; there was a farmer of my pari&s;h, who u&s;ed to &s;up upon wild ducks and flummery; &s;o this farmer&mdash;<HI>Doctor Marrowfat,</HI> cries his Lord&s;hip, interrupting him, <HI>give me leave to drink your health</HI>&mdash;&s;o being fond of wild ducks and flummery&mdash;<HI>Doctor,</HI> adds a gentleman who &s;ate next him, <HI>let me advi&s;e you to a wing of this turkey;</HI>&mdash;&s;o this farmer being fond&mdash;<HI>Hob nob, Doctor, which do you chu&s;e, white or red?</HI>&mdash;So being fond of wild ducks and flummery;&mdash;<HI>take care of your band, Sir, it may dip in the gravy.</HI> The Doctor, now look|ing round, found not a &s;ingle <HI>eye</HI> di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten; wherefore calling for a gla&s;s of wine, he gulped down the di&s;appointment and the tale in a bumper.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now began to be little more than a rhap&s;ody of exclamations; as each had pretty well &s;atisfied his own appetite, he now found &s;ufficient time to pre&s;s others. <HI>Excellent, the very thing; let me recommend the pig, do but ta&s;te the bacon; never eat a better thing in my life; exqui&s;ite, delicious.</HI> This edifying di&s;cour&s;e continued thro' three cour&s;es, which la&s;ted as many hours, till every one of the com|pany were unable to &s;wallow or utter any thing more.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256">
It is very natural for men who are abridged in one exce&s;s, to break into &s;ome other. The clergy here, particularly tho&s;e who are advanced in years, think if they are ab&s;temious with regard to women and wine, they may indulge their other appetites without cen&s;ure. Thus &s;ome are found to ri&s;e in the morning only to a con&s;ultation with their cook about dinner, and when that has been &s;wallowed, make no other u&s;e of their faculties (if they have any) but to ruminate on the &s;uc|ceeding meal.</P>
<P>A debauch in wine is even more pardonable than this, &s;ince one gla&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly leads on to another, and in&s;tead of &s;ateing whets the appetite. The progre&s;&s;ive &s;teps to it are chearful and &s;educing; the grave are animated, the melancholy relieved, and there is even cla&s;&s;ic authority to countenance the exce&s;s. But in eating after nature is once &s;atisfied, every additional mor&s;el brings &s;tupidity and di&s;tempers with it, and as one of their own poets expre&s;&s;es it,<Q> 
<L>The &s;oul &s;ub&s;ides, and wickedly inclines,</L>
<L>To &s;eem but mortal, even in &s;ound divines.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let me &s;uppo&s;e, after &s;uch a meal as this I have been de&s;cribing, while all the company are &s;itting in lethargic &s;ilence round the table, grunting under a load of &s;oup, pig, pork, and bacon; let me &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;ome hungry beggar, with looks of want, peeping through one of the windows, and thus addre&s;&s;ing the a&s;&s;embly, <HI>Prithee, pluck tho&s;e napkins from your chins; after nature is &s;atisfied all that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> extraordinary is my property, and I claim it as mine.

But though neither you nor the cu&s;hions you &s;it upon will hear me, yet the world regards the exce&s;&s;es of its teachers with a pry|ing eye, and notes their conduct with double &s;everity.</HI> I know no other an&s;wer any one of the company could make to &s;uch an expo&s;tulation, but this: "Friend, you talk of our lo&s;ing a character, and being di&s;liked by the world; well, and &s;uppo&s;ing all this to be true, what then! who cares for the world?

<P>YOU will probably be plea&s;ed to &s;ee my letter dated from Terki, a city which lies beyond the bounds of the Per&s;ian empire: here, ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ecurity, with all that is dear, I double my raptures, by communicating them to you; the mind &s;ympathiz|ing with the freedom of the body, my whole &s;oul is dilated in gratitude, love, and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet were my own happine&s;s all that in&s;pired my pre|&s;ent joy, my raptures might ju&s;tly merit the imputa|tion of &s;elf-intere&s;t; but when I think that the beauti|ful Zelis is al&s;o free, forgive my triumph when I boa&s;t of having re&s;cued from captivity the mo&s;t de&s;erving object upon earth.</P>
<P>You remember the reluctance &s;he te&s;tified at being obliged to marry the tyrant &s;he hated. Her compliance at la&s;t was only feigned, in order to gain time to try
<PB N="257" REF="258">
&s;ome future means of e&s;cape. During the interval be|tween her promi&s;e and the intended performance of it, &s;he came undi&s;covered one evening to the place where I generally retired after the fatigues of the day; her appearance was like that of an aerial genius, when, it de&s;cends to mini&s;ter comfort to unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;s; the mild lu&s;tre of her eye &s;erved to bani&s;h my timidity; her accents were &s;weeter than the echo of &s;ome di&s;tant &s;ymphony. "Unhappy &s;tranger, &s;aid &s;he, in the Per&s;ian language, you here perceive one more wretched than thy&s;elf; all this &s;olemnity of preparation, this elegance of dre&s;s, and the number of my attendants, &s;erve but to encrea&s;e my mi&s;eries; if you have courage to re&s;cue an unhappy woman from approaching ruin, and our dete&s;ted tyrant, you may depend upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">u|ture gratitude." I bowed to the ground, and &s;he left me, filled with rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment. Night brought no re&s;t, nor could the en&s;uing morning calm the anxieties of my mind. I projected a thou&s;and me|thods for her delivery; but each, when &s;trictly exa|mined, appeared impracticable; in this uncertainty the evening again arrived, and I placed my&s;elf on my for|mer &s;tation in hopes of a repeated vi&s;it. After &s;ome &s;hort expectation, the bright perfection again appeared; I bowed, as before, to the ground; when rai&s;ing me up &s;he ob&s;erved, that the time was not to be &s;pent in u&s;ele&s;s ceremony; &s;he ob&s;erved that the day following was appointed for the celebration of her nuptials, and that &s;omething was to be done that very night for our mutual deliverance. I offered with the utmo&s;t humi|lity to pur&s;ue whatever &s;cheme &s;he &s;hould direct; upon which &s;he propo&s;ed that in&s;tant to &s;cale the garden wall, adding, that &s;he had prevailed upon a female &s;lave, who was now waiting at the appointed place, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with a ladder.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
Pur&s;uant to this information I led her trembling to the place appointed; but in&s;tead of the &s;lave we ex|pected to &s;ee, Mo&s;tadad him&s;elf was there awaiting our arrival; the wretch in whom we confided, it &s;eems, had betrayed our de&s;ign to her ma&s;ter, and he now &s;aw the mo&s;t convincing proofs of her informa|tion. He was ju&s;t going to draw his &s;abre, when a principle of avarice repre&s;&s;ed his fury, and he re&s;olved, after a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, to di&s;po&s;e of me to another ma&s;ter, in the mean time ordering me to be confined in the &s;tricteit manner, and the next day to receive an hundred blows on the &s;oles of my feet.</P>
<P>When the morning came I was led out in order to receive the puni&s;hment, which, from the &s;everity with which it is generally inflicted upon &s;laves, is wor&s;e e|ven than death.</P>
<P>A trumpet was to be a &s;ignal for the &s;olemnization of the nuptials of Zelis, and for the infliction of my puni&s;hment. Each ceremony to me equally dreadful was ju&s;t going to begin, when we were informed that a large party of Circa&s;&s;ian Tartars had invaded the town, and were laying all in ruin. Every per&s;on now thought of &s;aving him&s;elf; I in&s;tantly unloo&s;ed the cords with which I was bound, and &s;eizing a &s;cymetar from one of the &s;laves who had not courage to re&s;i&s;t me, flew to the women's apartment where Zelis was confined, dre&s;&s;ed out for the intended nuptials. I bade her follow me without delay; and going forward, cut my way through eunuchs, who made but a faint re|&s;i&s;tance. The whole city was now a &s;cene of confla|gration and terror; every per&s;on was willing to &s;ave him&s;elf, unmindful of others. In this confu&s;ion &s;eiz|ing upon two of the fleete&s;t cour&s;ers in the &s;tables of
<PB N="259" REF="260">
Mo&s;tadad, we fled northward towards the kingdom of Circa&s;&s;ia As there were &s;everal others flying in the &s;ame manner, we pa&s;&s;ed without notice, and in three days arrived at Terki, a city that lies in a valley within the bo&s;om of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">owning mountains of Cauca&s;us.</P>
<P>Here, free from every apprehen&s;ion of danger, we enjoy all tho&s;e &s;atisfactions which are con&s;i&s;tent with virtue; though I find my heart at intervals give way to unu&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions, yet &s;uch is my admiration for my fair companion, that I lo&s;e even tenderne&s;s in di&s;tant re&s;pect. Though her per&s;on demands particular re|gard even among the beauties of Circa&s;&s;ia, yet is her mind far more lovely. How very different is a woman who thus has cultivated her under&s;tanding, and been refined into delicacy of &s;entiment, from the daughters of the ea&s;t, who&s;e education is only formed to improve the per&s;on, and make them more tempting objects of pro&s;titution!</P>

<P>WHEN &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed after the fatigues of our precipitate flight, my curio&s;ity, which had been re&s;trained by the appearance of immediate danger, now began to revive: I longed to know by what di&s;tre&s;sful accidents my fair fugitive became a captive, and could not avoid te&s;tifying a &s;urprize how &s;o much beauty could be involved in the calamities from whence &s;he had been &s;o lately re&s;cued.</P>
<P>Talk not of per&s;onal charms, cried &s;he with emo|tion,
<PB N="260" REF="261">
&s;ince to them I owe every misfortune: look round on the numberle&s;s beauties of the country where we are; and &s;ee how nature has poured its charms upon every face, and yet by this profu&s;ion heaven would &s;eem to &s;hew how little it regards &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince the gift is lavi&s;hed upon a nation of pro&s;titutes.</P>
<P>I perceive you de&s;ire to know my &s;tory, and your curio&s;ity is not &s;o great as my impatience to gratify it: I find a plea&s;ure in telling pa&s;t misfortunes to any, but when my deliverer is plea&s;ed with the relation, my plea&s;ure is prompted by duty.</P>
<P>"I<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory bears a &s;triking &s;imilitude to the real hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d who accompanied Lady W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, in her retreat near Florence, and which the editor had from her own mouth.</NOTE> was born in a country far to the we&s;t, where the men are braver, and the women more fair than tho&s;e of Circa&s;&s;ia; where the valour of the hero is guided by wi&s;dom, and where delicacy of &s;entiment points the &s;hafts of female beauty. I was the only daughter of an officer in the army, the child of his age, and as he u&s;ed fondly to expre&s;s it, the only chain that bound him to the world, or made his life plea&s;ing. His &s;tation procured him an acquaint|ance with men of greater rank and fortune than him&s;elf, and his regard for me induced him to bring me into every family where he was acquainted: Thus I was early taught all the elegancies and fa&s;hionable foibles of &s;uch as the world calls polite, and though without fortune my&s;elf, was taught to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who lived as if they were poor.</P>
<P>My intercour&s;e with the great, and my affectation of grandeur procured me many lovers; but want of fortune deterred them all from any other views than
<PB N="261" REF="262">
tho&s;e of pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent moment agreeably, or of meditating my future ruin. In every company I found my&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed in a warmer &s;train of pa&s;&s;ion, than o|ther ladies who were &s;uperior in point of rank and beauty; and this I imputed to an exce&s;s of re&s;pect, which in reality proceeded from very different motives.</P>
<P>Among the number of &s;uch as paid me their ad|dre&s;&s;es, was a gentleman, a friend of my father, rather in the decline of life, with nothing remarkable either in his per&s;on or addre&s;s to recommend him. His age which was about forty, his fortune which was mode|rate, and barely &s;ufficient to &s;upport him, &s;erved to throw me off my guard, &s;o that I con&s;idered him as the only &s;incere admirer I had.</P>
<P>De&s;igning lovers in the decline of life are ever mo&s;t dangerous. Skilled in all the weakne&s;&s;es of the &s;ex, they &s;eize each favourable opportunity, and by having le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion than youthful admirers, have le&s;s real re&s;pect, and therefore le&s;s timidity. This in&s;idious wretch u&s;ed a thou&s;and arts to &s;ucceed in his ba&s;e de&s;igns, all which I &s;aw, but imputed to different views, becau&s;e I thought it ab&s;urd to believe the real motives.</P>
<P>As he continued to frequent my father's, the friend&s;hip between them became every day greater; and at la&s;t from the intimacy with which he was re|ceived, I was taught to look upon him as a guardian and a friend. Though I never loved, yet I e&s;teem|ed him; and this was enough to make me wi&s;h for an union, for which he &s;eemed de&s;irous, but to which he feigned &s;everal delays; while in the mean time, from a fal&s;e report of our being married, every other admirer for&s;ook me.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">
I was at la&s;t however awakened from the delu&s;ion, by an account of his being ju&s;t married to another young lady with a con&s;iderable fortune. This was no great mortification to me, as I had always regard|ed him merely from prudential motives; but it had a very different effect upon my father, who, ra&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate by nature, and be&s;ides &s;timulated by a mi&s;|taken notion of military honour, upbraided his friend in &s;uch terms, that a challenge was &s;oon given and ac|cepted.</P>
<P>It was about midnight when I was awakened by a me&s;&s;age from my father, who de&s;ired to &s;ee me that moment. I ro&s;e with &s;ome &s;urprize, and following the me&s;&s;enger, attended only by another &s;ervant, came to a field not far from the hou&s;e, where I found him, the a&s;&s;ertor of my honour, my only friend and &s;up|porter, the tutor and companion of my youth, lying on one &s;ide covered over with blood, and ju&s;t expiring. No tears &s;treamed down my cheeks, nor &s;igh e&s;caped from my brea&s;t at an object of &s;uch terror. I &s;at down, and &s;upporting his aged head in my lap gazed upon the gha&s;tly vi&s;age with an agony more poignant even than de&s;pairing madne&s;s. The &s;ervants were gone for more a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this gloomy &s;tillne&s;s of the night no &s;ounds were heard but his agonizing re|&s;pirations; no object was pre&s;ented but his wounds, which &s;till continued to &s;tream. With &s;ilent angui&s;h I hung over his dear face, and with my hands &s;trove to &s;top the blood as it flowed from his wounds; he &s;eemed at fir&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, but at la&s;t turning his dy|ing eyes upon me, "<HI>My dear, dear child, cried he, dear, though you have forgotten your own honour and &s;tained mine, I will yet forgive you; by abandoning</HI>
<PB N="263" REF="264">
<HI>virtue you have undone me and your&s;elf, yet take my forgivene&s;s with the &s;ame compa&s;&s;ion I wi&s;h heaven may pity me.</HI>" He expired. All my &s;ucceeding hap|pine&s;s fled with him. Reflecting that I was the cau&s;e of his death whom only I loved upon earth; accu&s;ed of betraying the honour of his family with his late&s;t breath; con&s;cious of my own innocence, yet with|out even a po&s;&s;ibility of vindicating it; without for|tune or friends to relieve or pity me, abandoned to infamy and the wide cen&s;uring world, I called out up|on the dead body that lay &s;tretched before me, and in the agony of my heart a&s;ked why he could have left me thus? Why, my dear, my only pappa, why could you ruin me thus and your&s;elf for ever ! O pity, and return, &s;ince there is none but you to comfort me.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found that I had real cau&s;e for &s;orrow; that I was to expect no compa&s;&s;ion from my own &s;ex, not a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the other; and that reputation was much more u&s;eful in our commerce with mankind than really to de&s;erve it. Wherever I came, I per|ceived my&s;elf received either with contempt or dete&s;ta|tion; or whenever I was civilly treated, it was from the mo&s;t ba&s;e and ungenerous motives.</P>
<P>Thus driven from the &s;ociety of the virtuous, I was at la&s;t, in order to di&s;pell the anxieties of in&s;upporta|ble &s;olitude, obliged to take up with the company of tho&s;e who&s;e characters were bla&s;ted like my own; but who perhaps de&s;erved their infamy. Among this num|ber was a lady of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, who&s;e charac|ter the public thought proper to brand even with greater infamy than mine. A &s;imilitude of di&s;tre&s;s &s;oon united us; I knew that general reproach had made her mi&s;erable; and I had learned to regard mi|&s;ery
<PB N="264" REF="265">
as an excu&s;e for guilt. Though this lady had not virtue enough to avoid reproach, yet &s;he had too much delicate &s;en&s;ibility not to feel it. She therefore propo&s;|ed our leaving the country where we were born, and going to live in Italy, where our characters and misfor|tunes would be unknown. With this I eagerly com|plied, and we &s;oon found our&s;elves in one of the mo&s;t charming retreats in the mo&s;t beautiful province of that inchanting country.</P>
<P>Had my companion cho&s;en this as a retreat for in|jured virtue, an harbour where we might look with tranquillity on the di&s;tant angry world, I &s;hould have been happy; but very different was her de&s;ign; &s;he had pitch'd upon this &s;ituation only to enjoy tho&s;e plea|&s;ures in private, which &s;he had not &s;ufficient effrontery to &s;atisfy in a more open manner. A nearer acquaint|ance &s;oon &s;hewed me the vicious part of her character; her mind as well as her body &s;eemed formed only for plea&s;ure; &s;he was &s;entimental only as it &s;erved to pro|tract the immediate enjoyment. Formed for &s;ociety a|lone, &s;he &s;poke infinitely better than &s;he wrote, and wrote infinitely better than &s;he lived. A per&s;on devoted to plea&s;ure often leads the mo&s;t mi&s;erable life imaginable; &s;uch was her ca&s;e; &s;he con&s;idered the natural moments of languor as in&s;upportable, pa&s;&s;ed all her hours between rapture and anxiety; ever in an extreme of agony or of bli&s;s. She felt a pain as &s;in|cere for want of appetite, as the &s;tarving wretch who wants a meal. In tho&s;e intervals &s;he u&s;ually kept her bed, and ro&s;e only when in expectation of &s;ome new enjoy|ment. The luxuriant air of the country, the roman|tic &s;ituation of her palace, and the genius of a people who&s;e only happine&s;s lies in &s;en&s;ual refinement, all contributed to bani&s;h the remembrance of her native country.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266">
But tho' &s;uch a life gave her plea&s;ure, it had a very different effect upon me; I grew every day more pen|&s;ive, and my melancholy was regarded as an in&s;ult up|on her good humour: I now perceived my&s;elf entirely unfit for all &s;ociety; di&s;carded from the good, and dete&s;t|ing the infamous, I &s;eemed in a &s;tate of war with every rank of people: that virtue which &s;hould have been my protection in the world, was here my crime: in &s;hort, dete&s;ting life, I was determined to become a reclu&s;e, to leave a world where I found no plea|&s;ure that could allure me to &s;tay. Thus determined, I am embarked in order to go by &s;ea to Rome, where I intend to take the veil; but even in &s;o &s;hort a pa&s;|&s;age my hard fortune &s;till attended me; our &s;hip was taken by a Barbary cor&s;air; the whole crew, and I among the number, being made &s;laves. It carries too much the air of romance to inform you of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es or ob&s;tinacy in this mi&s;erable &s;tate; it is enough to ob&s;erve that I have been bought by &s;everal ma&s;ters, each of whom perceiving my reluctance, rather than u&s;e violence, &s;old me to another, till it was my hap|pine&s;s to be at la&s;t re&s;cued by you."</P>
<P>Thus ended her relation, which I have abridg'd, but as &s;oon as we are arrived at Mo&s;cow, for which we intend to &s;et out &s;hortly, you &s;hall be informed of all more particularly. In the mean time, the great|e&s;t addition to my happine&s;s will to be to hear of yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo.</HEAD>
<P>THE news of your freedom lifts the load of for|mer anxiety from my mind; I can now think
<PB N="266" REF="267">
of my &s;on without regret, applaud his re&s;ignation un|der calamity, and his conduct in extricating him&s;elf from it.</P>
<P><HI>You are now free, ju&s;t let loo&s;e from the bondage of an hard ma&s;ter:</HI> this is the cri&s;is of your fate; and as you now manage fortune, &s;ucceeding life will be marked with happine&s;s or mi&s;ery; a few years per|&s;everance in prudence, which at your age is but ano|ther name for virtue, will en&s;ure comfort, plea&s;ure, tranquillity, e&s;teem; too eager an enjoyment of every good that now offers, will rever&s;e the medal, and pre|&s;ent you poverty, anxiety, remor&s;e, contempt.</P>
<P>As it has been ob&s;erved that none are better qualifi|ed to give others advice, than tho&s;e who have taken the lea&s;t of it them&s;elves; &s;o in this re&s;pect I find my|&s;elf perfectly authorized to offer mine, even though I &s;hould wave my paternal authority upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t u&s;ual way among young men who have no re&s;olution of their own, is fir&s;t to a&s;k one friend's advice and follow it for &s;ome time; then to a&s;k ad|vice of another, and turn to that; &s;o of a third, &s;till un&s;teady, always changing. However, be a&s;&s;ured that every change of this nature is for the wor&s;e; people may tell you of your being unfit for &s;ome pecu|liar occupations in life; but heed them not; what|ever employment you follow with per&s;everance and a&s;&s;iduity, will be found fit for you; it will be your &s;upport in youth, and comfort in age. In learning the u&s;eful part of every profe&s;&s;ion, very moderate a|bilities will &s;uffice; even if the mind be a little balanc|ed with &s;tupidity, it may in this ca&s;e be u&s;eful. Great abilities have always been le&s;s &s;erviceable to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors
<PB N="267" REF="268">
than moderate ones. Life has been compared to a race, but the allu&s;ion &s;till improves, by ob&s;erving that the mo&s;t &s;wift are ever the lea&s;t manageable.</P>
<P>To know one profe&s;&s;ion only, is enough for one man to know; and this (whatever the profe&s;&s;ors may tell you to the contrary) is &s;oon learned. Be contented therefore with one good employment; for if you un|der&s;tand two at a time, people will give you bu&s;ine&s;s in neither.</P>
<P>A conjurer and a taylor once happened to conver&s;e together. Alas, cries the taylor, what an unhappy poor creature am I; if people &s;hould ever take it in their heads to live without cloaths I am undone; I have no other trade to have recour&s;e to. Indeed, friend, I pity you &s;incerely, replies the conjurer; but, thank heaven, things are not quite &s;o bad with me; for if one trick &s;hould fail, I have a hundred tricks more for them yet. However, if at any time you are reduced to beggary, apply to me, and I will relieve you. A famine over &s;pread the land; the taylor made a &s;hift to live, becau&s;e his cu&s;tomers could not be with|out cloaths; but the poor conjurer, with all his hundred tricks, could find none that had money to throw away: it was in vain that he promi&s;ed to eat fire, or to vomit pins; no &s;ingle creature would re|lieve him, till he was at la&s;t obliged to beg from the very taylor who&s;e calling he had formerly de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are no ob&s;tructions more fatal to fortune than pride and re&s;entment. If you mu&s;t re&s;ent injuries at all, at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;s your indignation until you become rich, and then &s;hew away; the re&s;entment of a poor man is like the efforts of a harmle&s;s in&s;ect to &s;ting; it
<PB N="268" REF="269">
may get him cru&s;hed, but cannot defend him. Who values that anger which is con&s;umed only in empty menaces?</P>
<P>Once upon a time a goo&s;e fed its young by a pond &s;ide; and a goo&s;e in &s;uch circum&s;tances is always extremely proud, and exce&s;&s;ive punctilious. If any other animal without the lea&s;t de&s;ign to offend, happened to pa&s;s that way, the goo&s;e was immediate|ly at him. The pond, &s;he &s;aid, was hers, and &s;he would maintain a right in it, and &s;upport her honour, while &s;he had a bill to hi&s;s, or a wing to flutter. In this manner &s;he drove away ducks, pigs, and chickens; nay, even the in&s;idious cat was &s;een to &s;camper. A lounging ma&s;tiff, however, happened to pa&s;s by, and thought it no harm if he &s;hould lap a little of the wa|ter, as he was thir&s;ty. The guardian goo&s;e flew at him like a fury, pecked at him with her beak, and &s;lapped him with her feathers. The dog grew angry, had twenty times a good mind to give her a &s;ly &s;nap; but &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his indignation, becau&s;e his ma&s;ter was nigh, <HI>A pox take thee,</HI> cries he, <HI>for a fool, &s;ure tho&s;e who have neither &s;trength nor weapons to fight, at lea&s;t &s;hould be civil; that fluttering and hi&s;&s;ing of thine may one day get thine head &s;napt off, but it can neither injure thy enemies, or ever protect thee.</HI> So &s;aying, he went forward to the pond, quenched his thir&s;t, in &s;pite of the goo&s;e, and followed his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;truction to the fortune of youth is, that while they are willing to take offence from none, they are al&s;o equally de&s;irous of giving none offence. From hence they endeavour to plea&s;e all, comply with every reque&s;t, attempt to &s;uit them&s;elves to every company; have no will of their own, but like wax catch every
<PB N="269" REF="270">
contiguous impre&s;&s;ion. By thus attempting to give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, they at la&s;t find them&s;elves mi&s;era|bly di&s;appointed; to bring the generality of admirers on our &s;ide, it is &s;ufficient to attempt plea&s;ing a very few.</P>
<P>A painter of eminence was once re&s;olved to fini&s;h a piece which &s;hould plea&s;e the whole world. When, therefore, he had drawn a picture, in which his ut|mo&s;t &s;kill was exhau&s;ted, it was expo&s;ed in the pub|lic market-place, with directions at the bottom for every &s;pectator to mark with a bru&s;h, which lay by, every limb, and feature, which &s;eemed erroneous. The &s;pectators came, and in general applauded; but each, willing to &s;hew his talent at critici&s;m, marked whatever he thought proper. At evening, when the painter came, he was mortified to find the whole picture one univer&s;al blot; not a &s;ingle &s;troke that was not &s;tigmatized with marks of di&s;approbation: not &s;atisfied with this trial, the next day he was re|&s;olved to try them in a different manner, and expo&s;ing his picture as before, de&s;ired that every &s;pectator would mark tho&s;e beauties he approved or admired. The people complied, and the arti&s;t returning, found his picture replete with the marks of beauty; every &s;troke that had been ye&s;terday condemned now re|ceived the character of approbation. <HI>Well,</HI> cries the painter, <HI>I now find that the be&s;t way to plea&s;e one half of the world, is not to mind what the other half &s;ays; &s;ince what are faults in the eyes of the&s;e, &s;hall be by tho&s;e regarded as beauties.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>A Character, &s;uch as you have repre&s;ented that of your fair companion, which continues virtu|ous, though loaded with infamy, is truly great. Many regard virtue becau&s;e it is attended with applau&s;e; your favourite only for the internal plea&s;ure it confers. I have often wi&s;hed that ladies like her were propo&s;ed as models for female imitation, and not &s;uch as have ac|quired fame by qualities repugnant to the natural &s;oft|ne&s;s of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>Women famed for their valour, their &s;kill in poli|tics, or their learning, leave the duties of their own &s;ex, in order to invade the privileges of ours. I can no more pardon a fair one for endeavouring to wield the club of Hercules, than I could him for attempting to twirl her di&s;taff.</P>
<P>The mode&s;t virgin, the prudent wife, or the careful matron are much more &s;erviceable in life than petti|coated philo&s;ophers, blu&s;tering heroines, or virago queens. She who makes her hu&s;band and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice, and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies de&s;cribed in romance, who&s;e whole occupation is to murder mankind with &s;hafts from their quiver or their eyes.</P>
<P>Women, it has been ob&s;erved, are not naturally formed for great cares them&s;elves, but to &s;often ours. Their tenderne&s;s is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their pre&s;ervation; and the ea&s;e and
<PB N="271" REF="272">
chearfulne&s;s of their conver&s;ation, our de&s;irable retreat from the fatigues of inten&s;e application. They are confined within the narrow limits of dome&s;tick a&s;&s;idui|ty; and when they &s;tray beyond them, they move be|yond their &s;phere, and con&s;equently without grace.</P>
<P>Fame therefore has been very unju&s;tly di&s;pen&s;ed, among the female &s;ex. Tho&s;e who lea&s;t de&s;erved to be remembered, meet our admiration and applau&s;e; while many, who have been an honour to humanity, are pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. Perhaps no age has pro|duced a &s;tronger in&s;tance of mi&s;placed fame than the pre&s;ent; the Semiramis and the Thale&s;tris of antiquity are talked of, while a modern character, infinitely greater than either, is unnoticed and unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account &s;eems taken from the manu&s;cript memoirs of H. Spilman, E&s;q;</NOTE> Catharina Alexowna, born near Derpat, a little city in Livonia, was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality of her parents. Her father being dead, &s;he lived with her aged mother, in their cottage covered with &s;traw; and both, though very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands, &s;he &s;upported her parent, who was now incapable of &s;up|porting her&s;elf. While Catharina &s;pun, the old wo|man would &s;it by, and read &s;ome book of devotion; thus when the fatigues of the day were over, both would &s;it down contentedly by their fire-&s;ide, and en|joy the frugal meal with vacant fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>Though her face and per&s;on were models of per|fection, yet her whole attention &s;eemed be&s;towed upon
<PB N="272" REF="273">
her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old Lutheran mini&s;ter in&s;tructed her in the maxims and duties of religion. Nature had furni&s;hed her not only with a ready but a &s;olid turn of thought, not only with a &s;trong but a right under&s;tanding. Such truly female accompli&s;hments procured her &s;everal &s;olicitations of marriage from the pea&s;ants of the country; but their offers were refu&s;ed: for &s;he loved her mother too ten|derly to think of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Catharina was fifteen when her mother died; &s;he now therefore left her cottage, and went to live with the Lutheran mini&s;ter, by whom &s;he had been in|&s;tructed from her childhood. In his hou&s;e &s;he re&s;ided, in quality of governe&s;s to his children; at once recon|ciling in her character unerring prudence with &s;urpri|&s;ing vivacity.</P>
<P>The old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her in&s;tructed in dancing and mu&s;ic by the ma&s;ters who attended the re&s;t of his family; thus &s;he continued to improve till he died, by which acci|dent &s;he was once more reduced to pri&s;tine poverty. The country of Livonia was at this time wa&s;ted by war, and lay in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate of de&s;olation. Tho&s;e calamities are ever mo&s;t heavy upon the poor; wherefore Catharina, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many ac|compli&s;hments, experienced all the mi&s;eries of hopele&s;s indigence. Provi&s;ions becoming every day more &s;carce, and her private &s;tock being entirely exhau&s;ted, &s;he re|&s;olved at la&s;t to travel to Marienburgh, a city of grea|ter plenty.</P>
<P>With her &s;canty wardrobe, packed up in a wallet, &s;he &s;et out on her journey on foot: &s;he was to walk
<PB N="273" REF="274">
through a region mi&s;erable by nature, but rendered &s;till more hideous by the Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians, who, as each happened to become ma&s;ters, plundered it at di&s;|cretion: but hunger had taught her to de&s;pi&s;e the dan|gers and fatigues of the way.</P>
<P>One evening, upon her journey, as &s;he had entered a cottage by the way-&s;ide, to take up her lodging for the night, &s;he was in&s;ulted by two Swedi&s;h &s;oldiers, who in&s;i&s;ted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <HI>to follow the camp.</HI> They might, probably have car|ried their in&s;ults into violence, had not a &s;ubaltern offi|cer, accidentally pa&s;&s;ing by, come in to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: upon his appearing, the &s;oldiers immediately de&s;i&s;ted; but her thankfulne&s;s was hardly greater than her &s;ur|pri&s;e, when &s;he in&s;tantly recollected in her deliverer, the &s;on of the Lutheran mini&s;ter, her former in&s;tructor, benefactor, and friend.</P>
<P>This was an happy interview for Catharina: the little &s;tock of money &s;he had brought from home was by this time quite exhau&s;ted; her cloaths were gone, piece by piece, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who had enter|tained her in their hou&s;es; her generous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could &s;pare, to buy her cloaths, furni&s;hed her with an hor&s;e, and gave her let|ters of recommendation to Mr. Gluck, a faithful friend of his father's, and &s;uperintendant of Marienburgh.</P>
<P>Our beautiful &s;tranger had only to appear, to be well received; &s;he was immediately admitted into the Su|perintendant's family, as governe&s;s to his two daugh|ters; and though yet but &s;eventeen, &s;hewed her&s;elf capable of in&s;tructing her &s;ex not only in virtue, but
<PB N="274" REF="275">
politene&s;s. Such was her good &s;en&s;e and beauty, that her ma&s;ter him&s;elf in a &s;hort time offered her his hand, which to his great &s;urprize &s;he thought proper to refu&s;e. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, &s;he was re&s;olved to marry her deliverer only, even though he had lo&s;t an arm, and was otherwi&s;e disfigured by wounds in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In order therefore to prevent further &s;olicitations from others, as &s;oon as the officer came to town upon duty, &s;he offered him her per&s;on, which he accepted with tran&s;port, and their nuptials were &s;olemnized as u&s;ual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be &s;triking: the very day on which they were married the Ru&s;&s;ians laid &s;iege to Marienburgh; the unhappy &s;oldier had now no time to enjoy the well earned plea|&s;ures of matrimony; he was called off before con&s;um|mation to an attack, from which he was never after &s;een to return.</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;iege went on with fury, ag|gravated on one &s;ide by ob&s;tinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the innocent pea&s;ant and the harmle&s;s virgin often &s;hared the fate of the &s;ol|dier in arms. Marienburgh was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uch was the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants, that not only the garri&s;on, but almo&s;t all the inhabitants, men, women, and children, were put to the &s;word; at length when the carnage was pretty well over, Catharina was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>She had been hitherto poor, but &s;till was free: &s;he was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what
<PB N="275" REF="276">
it was to be a &s;lave: in this &s;ituation, however, &s;he behaved with piety and humility; and though misfor|tunes had abated her vivacity, yet &s;he was chearful. The fame of her merit and re&s;ignation reached even Prince Menzikoff, the Ru&s;&s;ian General; he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, was &s;truck with her beauty, bought her from the &s;oldier, her ma&s;ter, and placed her under the di|rection of his own &s;i&s;ter. Here &s;he was treated with all the re&s;pect which her merit de&s;erved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this &s;ituation, when Peter the Great paying the Prince a vi&s;it, Catharina happened to come in with &s;ome dry fruits, which &s;he &s;erved round with peculiar mode&s;ty. The mighty Monarch &s;aw, and was &s;truck with her beauty. He returned the next day, called for the beautiful &s;lave, a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions, and found her under&s;tanding even more per|fect than her per&s;on.</P>
<P>He had been forced when young to marry from mo|tives of intere&s;t, he was now re&s;olved to marry pur|&s;uant to his own inclinations. He immediately en|quired the hi&s;tory of the fair Livonian, who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of ob|&s;curity, through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanne&s;s of her birth was no ob&s;truction to his de&s;ign; their nup|tials were &s;olemnized in private; the Prince a&s;&s;uring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the propere&s;t ladder to a throne.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee Catharina, from the low mud-walled cottage, Empre&s;s of the greate&s;t kingdom upon earth.
<PB N="276" REF="277">
The poor &s;olitary wanderer is now &s;urrounded by thou&s;ands, who find happine&s;s in her &s;mile. She, who formerly wanted a meal, is now capable of diffu&s;ing plenty upon whole nations. To her fortune &s;he owed a part of this preheminence, but to her virtues more.</P>
<P>She ever after retained tho&s;e great qualities which fir&s;t placed her on a throne; and while the extraordi|nary Prince, her hu&s;band, laboured for the reforma|tion of his male &s;ubjects, &s;he &s;tudied in her turn the improvement of her own &s;ex. She altered their dre&s;&s;es, introduced mixed a&s;&s;emblies, in&s;tituted an order of fe|male knighthood; and, at length, when &s;he had great|ly filled all the &s;tations of Empre&s;s, friend, wife, and mother, bravely died without regret; regretted by all.</P>
