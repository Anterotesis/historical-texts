<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Faction now having lo&s;t all
Hopes of Succe&s;s by their unnatural
Rebellion, they apply them&s;elves
with the utmo&s;t Indu&s;try and Malice
to cry down the Proceedings of Ju|&s;tice
again&s;t the Rebels who are taken, as Barba|rous
and cruel, and having no Precedent in Hi|&s;tory.
This Clamour is &s;o very ill founded, and
&s;o remote from Truth, that it might be ju&s;tly
thought needle&s;s to give it any An&s;wer; but
&s;ince it is made u&s;e of by the Party farther to in|cen&s;e
the ignorant Mob again&s;t the Government,
it can't be thought ami&s;s to convict our Adver&s;a|ries
of Fal&s;hood, by putting them in mind of the
barbarous Cruelty of the late King <HI>James</HI> II. a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e who took Arms under the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>;
and likewi&s;e of that Prince's Barbarity to the
Prote&s;tants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Revolution.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things are &s;till remember'd by Thou|&s;ands
of Eye-Witne&s;&s;es, and therefore can admit
of no Contradiction, but from &s;uch as have bid
Defiance to Truth, becau&s;e they know the Inte|re&s;t
of Tyranny and Popery, which they e&s;pou&s;e,
can never be &s;upported by any other Methods
than Cruelty and Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
I &s;hall begin with the Proceedings in that
King's Reign again&s;t tho&s;e who took Arms in
the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> under the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI>
The Li&s;ts of tho&s;e who were executed, or other|wi&s;e
puni&s;h'd on that Account, are in the follow|ing
Treati&s;e, and more large and exact than
what has yet been publi&s;hed; &s;o that I &s;hall &s;ay
nothing of them here, but proceed to give &s;ome
Account of the Difference betwixt that and the
pre&s;ent Rebellion.</P>
<P>Every one knows, that tho&s;e who join'd the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not do it till after King
<HI>James</HI> II. had declared him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, and con|trary
to Law encourag'd tho&s;e of his own Per|&s;wa&s;ion
to &s;et up their Wor&s;hip publickly; and
he had likewi&s;e in an arbitrary and tyrannical
Manner invaded our Civil Liberties, as may be
&s;een by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Declaration, and
that of the Earl of <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The DECLARATION of <HI>James</HI>
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the No|blemen,
Gentlemen, and others,
now in Arms for the Defence and
Vindication of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Reli|gion,</HI>
and the <HI>Laws, Rights,</HI> and
<HI>Privileges</HI> of England.</HEAD>
<P>' AS Government was originally in&s;tituted
by God, and this or that Form of it
cho&s;en and &s;ubmitted to by Men, for the Peace,
Happine&s;s, and Security of the Governed, and
not for the private Intere&s;t, and per&s;onal
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Greatne&s;s of tho&s;e that rule; &s;o that Govern|ment
hath always been e&s;teemed the be&s;t, where
the Supreme Magi&s;trates have been inve&s;ted
with all the Power and Prerogatives that might
capacitate them, not only to pre&s;erve the Peo|ple
from Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion, but to pro|mote
their Pro&s;perity; and yet, where no|thing
was to belong to them by the Rules of
the Con&s;titution, that might enable them to
injure and oppre&s;s them. And it hath been the
Glory of <HI>England,</HI> above mo&s;t other Nations,
that the Prince had all entru&s;ted with him that
was nece&s;&s;ary, either for the advancing the
Welfare of the People, or for his own Prote|ction
in the Di&s;charge of the Office; and withal
&s;tood &s;o limited and re&s;trained by the Funda|mental
Terms of the Con&s;titution, that with|out
a Violation of his own Oath, as well as the
Rules and Mea&s;ures of the Government, he
could do them no Hurt, nor exerci&s;e any Act of
Authority, but through the Admini&s;tration of
&s;uch Hands as &s;tood obnoxious to be puni&s;hed
in ca&s;e they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed: So that according to
the primitive Frame of the Government, the
Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Privileges
of the Subject, are &s;o far from jo&s;tling one a|nother,
that the Rights re&s;erved unto the Peo|ple
tended to render the King Honourable and
Great, and the Prerogatives &s;ettled on the
Prince were in order to the Subjects Protection
and Safety. But all Human Things being &s;ub|ject
to Perver&s;ion, as well as Decay, it hath
been the Fate of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government to be
often changed, and wre&s;ted from what it was
in the fir&s;t Settlement and In&s;titution. And
we are particularly compelled to &s;ay, that all
the Boundaries of the Government have of late
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
been broken, and nothing le&s;s unattempted for
turning our limited Monarchy into an ab&s;olute
Tyranny: For &s;uch hath been the Tran&s;action
of Affairs within this Nation for &s;everal Years
la&s;t pa&s;t, that though the Prote&s;tant Religion
and Liberties of the People were fenced and
hedged about by as many Laws, as the Wi&s;dom
of Man can devi&s;e for their Pre&s;ervation again&s;t
Popery and Arbitrary Power, our Religion
hath been all along countermined by popi&s;h
Coun&s;els, and our Privileges ravi&s;hed from us
by Fraud and Violence. And more e&s;pecially
the whole Cour&s;e and Series of the Life of the
<HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Y.</HI> hath been but one continued Con&s;pi|racy
again&s;t the Reformed Religion, and the
Rights of the Nation: For, whoever con&s;iders
his contriving the burning of <HI>London,</HI> his in&s;ti|gating
a Confederacy with <HI>France,</HI> and a War
with <HI>Holland,</HI> fomenting the Popi&s;h Plot, and
encouraging the Murther of Sir <HI>Ed. Godfrey,</HI>
his charging Trea&s;on again&s;t Prote&s;tants, &s;ub|orning
Witne&s;&s;es to &s;wear the Patriots of our
Religion and Liberties out of their Lives; his
hiring execrable Villains to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the late
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and cau&s;ing tho&s;e others to be
clande&s;tinely cut off in Hopes to conceal it;
his advi&s;ing and procuring the Prorogation and
Di&s;&s;olution of Parliaments, in order to prevent
their looking into his Crimes, and that he might
e&s;cape the Ju&s;tice of the Nation; &s;uch can i|magine
nothing &s;o black and horrid in it &s;elf,
or &s;o ruinous and de&s;tructive to Religion and
the Kingdom, which we may not expect from
him.'</P>
<P>' The very Tyrannies which he hath exerci|&s;ed
&s;ince he &s;natched the Crown from his Bro|ther's
Head, do leave none under a Po&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
of flattering them&s;elves with Hopes of Safety,
either in their Con&s;ciences, Per&s;ons, or E|&s;tates:
For, in Defiance of all the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm, made for the Security
of the Reformed Prote&s;tant Religion, he not
only began his Reign with a bare-fac'd Avow|ing
him&s;elf of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion, but call'd in
Multitudes of Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, for whom the
Law makes it Trea&s;on to come into this King|dom;
and hath impower'd them to exerci&s;e I|dolatries:
And be&s;ides his being daily pre&s;ent
at the Wor&s;hip of the Ma&s;s, he hath publickly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the greate&s;t Fopperies of their Su|per&s;tition.
Neither hath he been more tender
in trampling upon the Laws which concern
our Properties, &s;eeing in two Proclamations,
whereof the one requires the collecting of the
Cu&s;toms, and the other the continuing that
part of the Exci&s;e which was to expire at the
late King's Death; he hath violently, and a|gain&s;t
all the Law of the Land, broken in up|on
our E&s;tates. Neither is it any Extenuation
of his Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it
by an extrajudicial Opinion of &s;even or eight
&s;uborned and for&s;worn Judges; but rather de|claring
the Greatne&s;s and Extent of the Con&s;pi|racy
again&s;t our Rights; and that there is no
Means left for our Relief, but by Force of
Arms: For, advancing tho&s;e to the Bench that
were the Scandal of the Bar; and con&s;tituting
tho&s;e very Men to declare the Laws, who are ac|cu&s;ed
and branded in Parliament for pervert|ing
them, we were precluded all Hopes of Ju|&s;tice
in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall:</HI> And by packing Ju|ries
together by fal&s;e Returns, new illegal
Charters, and other corrupt Means, he doth at
once deprive us of all Expectations of Succour
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
where our Ance&s;tors were wont to find it; and
hopes to render that which ought to be the
People's Fences again&s;t Tyranny, and the Con|&s;ervator
of their Liberties, the Means of &s;ub|verting
all our Laws, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing of his
Arbitrarine&s;s, and confirming our Thraldom.
So that unle&s;s we could be contented to &s;ee the
Reformed Prote&s;tant Religion, and &s;uch as
profe&s;s it, extirpated, Popi&s;h Super&s;tition and
Idolatry e&s;tabli&s;h'd, the Laws of the Land
trampled under Foot, the Liberties and Rights
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People &s;ubverted, and all that is
Sacred and Civil, or of Regard among&s;t Men of
Virtue or Piety, violated; and unle&s;s we could
be willing to be Slaves as well as Papi&s;ts, and
forget the Example of our Noble and Generous
Ance&s;tors, who conveyed our Privileges to us
at the Expence of their Blood and Trea&s;ure;
and withal, be unmindful of our Duty to God,
our Country and Po&s;terity; deaf to the Cries
and Groans of our oppre&s;&s;ed Friends, and be
&s;atisfied not only to &s;ee them and our &s;elves
impri&s;on'd, robb'd, and murdered, but the Pro|te&s;tant
Intere&s;t throughout the whole World,
betrayed to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>; we are bound, as
Men and Chri&s;tians, and that in Di&s;charge of
our Duty to God, and our Country, and for
the Satisfaction of the Prote&s;tant Nations round
about us, to betake our &s;elves to Arms; which
we take Heaven and Earth to witne&s;s, we
&s;hould not have done, had not the Malice of
our Enemies deprived us of all other Means of
Redre&s;s; and were not the Mi&s;eries that we al|ready
feel, and tho&s;e which do further threaten
us, wor&s;e than the Calamities of War. And it
is not for any per&s;onal Injuries, or private Di&s;|contents,
nor in pur&s;uance of any corrupt In|tere&s;t,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
that we take our Swords in our Hands;
but for vindicating our Religion, Laws and
Rights, and re&s;cuing our Country from Ruin
and De&s;truction, and for the pre&s;erving our
&s;elves, Wives and Children, from Bondage and
Idolatry. Wherefore, before God, Angels and
Men, we &s;tand acquitted from, and do charge
upon our Enemies, all the Slaughter and De|va&s;tations
that unavoidably accompany inte|&s;tine
War.'</P>
<P>' Now, therefore, we do hereby &s;olemnly de|clare
and proclaim War again&s;t <HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI> as
a Murderer, and an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of innocent Men,
a Traytor to the Nation, and a Tyrant over
the People: And we would have none that ap|pear
under his Banner to flatter them&s;elves with
Expectation of Forgivene&s;s, it being our firm
Re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute him, and his Adhe|rents,
without giving Way to Treaties and Ac|commodations,
until we have brought him
and them to undergo what the Rule of the
Con&s;titution, and the Statutes of the Realm,
as well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture, and
Nations, adjudge to be Puni&s;hment due to the
Enemies of God, Mankind, their Country, and
all Things that are Honourable, Virtuous, and
Good.'</P>
<P>' And though we cannot avoid being &s;en&s;ible
that too many have, from Cowardi&s;e, Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s
and Ambition, co-operated to the
&s;ubverting of our Religion, and en&s;laving their
Country; yet we would have none, from a
De&s;pair of finding Mercy, per&s;evere in their
Crimes, nor continue the Ruin of the King|dom:
For we exclude none from the Benefit
of Repentance, that will join with us in retrie|ving
that they have been acce&s;&s;ary to the Lo&s;s
<PB N="x" REF="9">
of: Nor do we de&s;ign Revenge upon any, but
the ob&s;tinate, and &s;uch as &s;hall be found at this
Juncture yielding Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;aid
<HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI>'</P>
<P>' And that we may both govern our &s;elves in
the Pur&s;uit of this glorious Cau&s;e wherein we
are engaged, and give Encouragement to all
that &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t us in &s;o righteous and nece&s;&s;ary
an Undertaking, we do, in the Pre&s;ence of the
Lord, who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts,
and is the Avenger of Deceit and Fal&s;hood,
proclaim and publi&s;h what we aim at; and for
the obtaining whereof, we have both determi|ned
to venture, and are ready to lay down our
Lives. And though we are not come into the
Field to introduce Anarchy and Confu&s;ion, or
for laying a&s;ide any Part of the Old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Go|vernment,
yet our Purpo&s;es and Re&s;olutions
are, to reduce Things to that Temperament
and Ballance, that future Rulers may remain
able to do all the Good that can be either de&s;i|red
or expected from them: and that it may
not be in their Power to invade the Rights, and
infringe the Liberties of the People.'</P>
<P>' And whereas our Religion, the mo&s;t valua|ble
thing we lay claim unto, hath been &s;haken
by unju&s;t Laws, undermined by Popi&s;h Coun|&s;els,
and is now in Danger to be &s;ubverted, we
are therefore re&s;olved to &s;pend our Blood for
pre&s;erving it to our &s;elves and Po&s;terity: Nor
will we lay down our Arms till we &s;ee it e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
and &s;ecured beyond all Probability of
being &s;upplanted and overthrown, and until
all the Penal Laws again&s;t all Prote&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enters be repealed, and legal Provi&s;ion
made again&s;t their being di&s;turbed, by rea&s;on
of their Con&s;ciences, and for their enjoying
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
an equal Liberty with other Prote&s;tants.'</P>
<P>' And that the Meekne&s;s and Purity of our
Principles, and the Moderation and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
of our End may appear unto all Men,
we do declare, That we will not make War up|on
or de&s;troy any for their Religion, how
fal&s;e and erroneous &s;oever: So that the very
Papi&s;ts, provided they withdraw from the
Tents of our Enemies, and be not found Guil|ty
of con&s;piring our De&s;truction, or Abettors
of them that &s;eek it, have nothing to fear or
apprehend from us, except what may hinder
their altering our Laws, and endangering our
Per&s;ons in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Reformed Do|ctrine,
and Exerci&s;e of our Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip.'</P>
<P>' Our Re&s;olution in the next Place is, To
maintain all the ju&s;t Rights and Privileges of
Parliament, and to have Parliaments annually
cho&s;en and held, and not prorogued, di&s;&s;olved,
or di&s;continued within the Year, before Peti|tions
be fir&s;t an&s;wered, and Grievances redre&s;|&s;ed.'</P>
<P>' And &s;eeing many of the Mi&s;eries under
which the Nation doth groan, ari&s;e from di&s;|placing
&s;uch out of the Number of Judges as
would not, for the promoting Popi&s;h and Ar|bitrary
De&s;igns, wre&s;t and mi&s;apply the Laws,
and from con&s;tituting Corrupt and Mercenary
Men in their Rooms, on purpo&s;e to &s;tretch the
Laws beyond the Rea&s;on and Intention of them;
and to declare that for Law which is not; we
can neither with Silence pa&s;s over the mention|ing
of them; nor &s;hould we have Peace in our
&s;elves, if we did not endeavour to prevent the
like Mi&s;chief in Time to come. For by Rea&s;on
of ill Men's being advanced to the Bench, and
holding their Places only <HI>durante bene placito,</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
many Per&s;ons have been condemned in exorbi|tant
Fines for no Crimes, or for very &s;mall
ones: Many Statutes made for the Safety of the
Subject, particularly the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act,
have been wickedly eluded, to the Oppre&s;&s;ion
of the Innocent and Loyal Men. The Popi&s;h
Lords that were impeached in Parliament for
a mo&s;t helli&s;h Con&s;piracy, have, to the &s;ub|verting
the Rights of the Hou&s;e of Lords, been
di&s;charged, and &s;et free. The impo&s;ing a
Mayor and Sheriffs upon the City of <HI>London,</HI>
by Fraud and Violence, have been ju&s;tified,
and tho&s;e who in di&s;charge of their Duty op|po&s;ed
it, illegally pro&s;ecuted, and arbitrarily
puni&s;hed. <HI>London,</HI> and other Cities and Cor|porations,
have been robbed of their Char|ters,
upon unrighteous Judgments of pretended
Forfeitures. Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI> executed
without being allowed the Benefit of a Tryal.
Colonel <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> condemn'd to die up|on
the Depo&s;ition of one &s;candalous Witne&s;s.
And that Loyal and Excellent Per&s;on, the late
<HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> murthered for alledged
Crimes; in reference to which, if all had been
true which was &s;worn again&s;t him, yet there
was nothing which according to Law could
have reached his Life. Upon the Con&s;idera|tions
afore&s;aid, we further declare, that we will
have Care taken for the future, for the debar|ring
ignorant, &s;candalous, and mercenary Men
from the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; and that
the Judges &s;hall hold their Places by the anci|ent
Tenure of <HI>quam diu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint</HI>; and to
leave it to the Wi&s;dom of a Parliament, to &s;et|tle
&s;ome Way and Method for the Approbation
of &s;uch as &s;hall be advanced to the Degree and
Dignity of Judges.'</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12">
' And fora&s;much as the Inva&s;ion made on the
Right of Cities, Burroughs, and Towns Cor|porate;
the Sei&s;ure of their Charters, whether
by Surrender, or upon pretence of Forfeiture,
have been wholly arbitrary and illegal; we
likewi&s;e therefore declare, we will, to our ut|mo&s;t,
endeavour to &s;ee them repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in what
they formerly had, and could legally lay claim
to; and that we do e&s;teem all Judgments given
again&s;t them, and all Surrenders made by a cor|rupt
and perjured Party among&s;t them, null and
void in Law; and do hold and declare their
old Charters, notwith&s;tanding the new ones
lately granted, to be good and valid: And ac|cordingly
we do invite and encourage all ho|ne&s;t
Burge&s;&s;es and Free-men to re-a&s;&s;ume the
Rights and Privileges, which by Virtue of the
&s;aid old Charters, belonged to their &s;everal and
re&s;pective Corporations; and to deliver them|&s;elves
from tho&s;e late Para&s;ites, and In&s;tru|ments
of Tyranny &s;et up to oppre&s;s them.'</P>
<P>' Moreover, for the re&s;toring the Kingdom to
its Primitive Condition of Freedom and Safety,
we will have the <HI>Corporation</HI> and <HI>Militia Acts</HI>
repealed: And all Outlawries of Trea&s;on again&s;t
any Per&s;on what&s;oever, upon the late pretend|ed
Porte&s;tant Plot, rever&s;ed; and al&s;o, all other
Outlawries, Bani&s;hments, Warrants, Judg|ments,
Impri&s;onments, and injurious Proceed|ings
again&s;t any other Per&s;ons, upon any of
the Penal Statutes made again&s;t Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters,
made null and void. And we will
have new Laws enacted for placing the Electi|on
of Sheriffs in the Freeholders of the &s;everal
Countries, for &s;ettling the Militia in the &s;everal
Shires, and for preventing all Military &s;tanding
Forces, except what &s;hall be rai&s;ed and kept up
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
by Authority and Con&s;ent of Parliament.'</P>
<P>' And whereas &s;everal Gentlemen and others,
who have been worthy and zealous A&s;&s;ertors
of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and Laws of the
Kingdom, are now in Cu&s;tody in divers Places
within the Realm, upon mo&s;t unju&s;t Accu&s;ati|ons,
Pretences, Proceedings and Judgments;
we do hereby further declare the &s;aid Impri&s;on|ments
to be illegal; and that in ca&s;e any Vio|lence
&s;hall be offered to them, or any of them,
we will revenge it to the utmo&s;t upon &s;uch of
our Enemies as &s;hall fall into our Hands.'</P>

the expenditing the Idolatrous and Bloody De|&s;igns
of the Papi&s;ts, the gratifying his own
boundle&s;s Ambition after a Crown, and to hin|der
Enquiry into the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of <HI>Arthur</HI>
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> hath poy&s;on'd the late King, and
thereby manife&s;ted his Ingratitude, as well as
Cruelty to the World, in murthering a Brother
who had almo&s;t ruin'd him&s;elf to pre&s;erve and
protect him from Puni&s;hment; We do there|fore

Ju&s;tice, and Authority of a Parliament
legally cho&s;en, and acting with Freedom;
and in the mean time doth profe&s;s and declare,
by all that is &s;acred, That he will, in Conjun|ction
with the People of <HI>England,</HI> employ all
the Abilities be&s;towed upon him by God and
Nature, for the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment and Pre&s;erva|tion
of the Prote&s;tant Reformed Religion in
the&s;e Kingdoms, and for re&s;toring the Subjects
of the &s;ame to a free Exerci&s;e thereof, in Op|po&s;ition
to Popery, and the Con&s;equences of it,
Tyranny and Slavery. To the obtaining of
which End, he doth hereby Promi&s;e and Ob|lige
him&s;elf to the People of <HI>England,</HI> to con|&s;ent
unto, and promote the pa&s;&s;ing into Laws
all the Methods afore&s;aid; that it may never

<P>' And whereas the Nobility and Gentry, and
Commons of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are now in Arms upon the
like Motives and Inducements that we are, and in
Pro&s;ecution of Ends agreeable with ours, we do
therefore approve the Ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e, com|mend
their Zeal and Courage, expecting their,

being obliged, avoiding Tediou&s;ne&s;s, to omit the
recounting many Oppre&s;&s;ions under which that
Kingdom hath groaned, and the giving a De|duction
of the &s;everal Steps that have been ta|ken
for introducing of Popery and Tyranny. We
think fit, therefore, to &s;ignifie both to our Coun|try-men
and Foreigners, that we intend a larger
Te&s;timony and Remon&s;trance of the Grievances,
Per&s;ecutions, Cruelties and Tyrannies, we have
of late lain under; and therein a full and more
particular Account of the unparallel'd Crimes
of the D. of <HI>Y.</HI> And we make our Appeal unto
GOD, and all Prote&s;tant Kings, Princes, States,
and People, concerning the Ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e,
and the Nece&s;&s;ity we are reduced unto of ha|ving
our Recour&s;e to Arms. And as we do be|&s;eech,
require and adjure all &s;incere Prote&s;tants,
and true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to us again&s;t
the Enemies of the Go&s;pel, Rights of the Na|tion,
and Liberties of Mankind; &s;o we are con|fident
of obtaining the utmo&s;t Aid and Succour
which they can yield us with their Prayers,
Per&s;ons, and E&s;tates, for the dethroning the
&s;aid Tyrant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor do we doubt being ju&s;ti|fied,
countenanced, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all Prote|&s;tant
Kings, Princes, and Common-wealths,
who either regard the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
or their own Intere&s;t. And above all, our De|pendance
and Tru&s;t is upon the Lord of Ho&s;ts,
in who&s;e Name we go forth, and to whom we
commit our Cau&s;e, and refer the Deci&s;ion be|twixt
us and our Enemies in the Day of Battle.
<HI>Now let us play the Men for our People, and for
the Cities of our GOD; and the Lord do that

<P>As we are firmly re&s;olved never to lo&s;e
any Opportunity of a&s;&s;erting Our undoubted
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
Title to the Imperial Crown of the&s;e Realms,
and of endeavouring to get the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that Right which is devolved upon Us by the
Laws of God and Man; &s;o mu&s;t We, in Ju&s;tice
to the Sentiments of Our own Heart, declare,
That nothing in the World can give Us &s;o great
Satisfaction, as to owe to the Endeavours of
Our Loyal Subjects both Our own and their
Re&s;toration to that happy Settlement which
can alone deliver this Church and Nation from
the Calamities which they lie at pre&s;ent under,
and from the&s;e future Mi&s;eries which mu&s;t be
the Con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent U&s;urpation.
During the Life of Our dear Si&s;ter, of Glorious
Memory, the Happine&s;s which our People
enjoyed, &s;oftened, in &s;ome Degree, the Hard|&s;hip
of our own Fate; and we mu&s;t further
confe&s;s that when we reflected on the Good|ne&s;s
of her Nature, and her Inclination to Ju|&s;tice,
We could not but per&s;wade Our &s;elf, that
&s;he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h and perpetuate the
Peace which &s;he had given to the&s;e Kingdoms,
by de&s;troying for ever all Competition to the
Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, and by con&s;enting
to us, at la&s;t, the Enjoyment of that Inheri|tance
out of which we had been &s;o long kept,
which her Con&s;cience mu&s;t inform Her was our
Due, and which her Principles mu&s;t lead her
to de&s;ire, that We might obtain. But &s;ince the
Time, it plea&s;ed God to put a Period to her
Life, and not to &s;uffer Us to throw Our &s;elf,
as We then firmly purpo&s;ed to have done, upon
Our People; We have not been able to look
upon the pre&s;ent Condition of Our Kingdoms,
or to con&s;ider their future Pro&s;pect, without all
the Horror and Indignation which ought to
fill the Brea&s;t of every <HI>Scot&s;man.</HI> We have be|held
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
a Foreign Family, Aliens to our Country,
di&s;tant in Blood, and Strangers even to our
Language, a&s;cend the Throne. We have &s;een
the Reins of Government put into the Hands of
a Faction, and that Authority which was de|&s;ign'd
for the Protection of all, exerci&s;ed by a
few of the wor&s;t, to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the
be&s;t and greate&s;t Number of Our Subjects.
Our Si&s;ter has not been left at Re&s;t in her
Grave, her Name has been &s;currilou&s;ly abu&s;ed,
her Glory, as far as in the&s;e People lay, in&s;o|lently
defaced, and her faithful Servants inhu|manly
per&s;ecuted. A Parliament has been pro|cured
by the mo&s;t unwarrantable Influences,
and by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Corruptions to &s;erve the
vile&s;t Ends, and they, who ought to be the
Guardians of the Liberties of the People, are
become the In&s;truments of Tyranny: Whil&s;t
the principal Powers engaged in the late Wars,
do enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, and are atten|tive
to di&s;charge their Debts, and ea&s;e their
People; <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in the mid&s;t of Peace,
feels all the Load of War. New Debts are
contracted, new Armies are rai&s;ed at Home,
<HI>Dutch</HI> Forces are brought into the&s;e King|doms,
and by taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutchy
of <HI>Bremen,</HI> in Violation of the Publick Faith,
a Door is opened by the U&s;urper, to let in an
Inundation of Foreigners from abroad, and to
reduce the&s;e Nations to the State of a Province,
to one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Provinces of
the Empire.'</P>
<P>' The&s;e are &s;ome few of the many real Evils
into which the&s;e Kingdoms have been betray|ed,
under Pretence of being re&s;cued and &s;e|cured
from Dangers purely imaginary; and
the&s;e are &s;uch Con&s;equences of abandoning
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
the old Con&s;titution, as we per&s;wade Our &s;elves
very many of tho&s;e who promoted the pre&s;ent
unju&s;t and illegal Settlement never intended.'</P>
<P>' We ob&s;erve, with the utmo&s;t Satisfaction,
that the Generality of Our Subjects are awa|ken'd
with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Danger, and
that they &s;hew them&s;elves re&s;olv'd to take &s;uch
Mea&s;ures as may effectually re&s;cue them from
that Bondage which has, by the Artifice of a
few de&s;igning Men, and the Concurrence of ma|ny
unhappy Cau&s;es, been brought upon them.'</P>
<P>' We adore the Wi&s;dom of Divine Provi|dence,
which has opened a Way to our Re&s;to|ration,
by the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e very Mea&s;ures
that were laid to di&s;appoint Us for ever: And
We mu&s;t earne&s;tly conjure all Our Loving
Subjects, not to &s;uffer that Spirit to faint or
die away, which has been &s;o miraculou&s;ly rai|&s;ed
in all Parts of our Kingdom; but to pur&s;ue,
with all the Vigour and Hopes of Succe&s;s,
which &s;o Ju&s;t and Righteous a Cau&s;e ought to
in&s;pire, tho&s;e Methods, which the Finger of
God &s;eems to point out to them.'</P>
<P>' We are coming to take Our Part in all the
Dangers and Difficulties to which any of Our
Subjects, from the Greate&s;t down to the Mean|e&s;t,
may be expo&s;ed, on this important Occa|&s;ion,
to relieve our Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> from
the Hard&s;hips they groan under, on account of
the late unhappy Union; and to re&s;tore the
Kingdom to its Ancient, Free, and Indepen|dent
State. We have before our Eyes the Ex|ample
of Our Royal Grandfather, who &s;ell a
Sacrifice to Rebellion; and of Our Royal Un|cle,
who, by a Train of Miracles, e&s;caped the
Rage of Barbarous and Blood-thir&s;ty Rebels, and
lived to exerci&s;e his Clemency towards tho&s;e
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
who had waged War again&s;t his Father and
him&s;elf; who had driven him to &s;eek Shelter
in Foreign Lands, and who had even &s;et a
Price upon his Head.'</P>
<P>' We &s;ee the &s;ame In&s;tances of Cruelty renew|ed
again&s;t Us, by Men of the &s;ame Principles,
without any other Rea&s;on, than the Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of their own Guilt, and the implacable Ma|lice
of their own Hearts: For in the Account
of &s;uch Men, it's a Crime &s;ufficient to be their
King; but God forbid that we &s;hould tread in
the&s;e Steps, or that the Cau&s;e of a Law&s;ul Prince,
and an Injuried People, &s;hould be carried on like
that of Tyranny and U&s;urpation, and owe its
Support to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. We &s;hall copy after the
Patterns above-mentioned, and be ready with
the former of Our Royal Ance&s;tors, to Seal the
Cau&s;e of our Country, if &s;uch be the Will of
Heaven, with Our Blood: But we hope for
better Things, we hope for the latter, to &s;ee
our ju&s;t Rights, and tho&s;e of the Church and
People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> once more &s;ettled in a Free
and Independent <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, on their an|cient
Foundation; to &s;uch a Parliament, which
we will immediately call, &s;hall we entirely re|fer
Our, and their Intere&s;ts, being &s;en&s;ible that
the&s;e Intere&s;ts rightly under&s;tood, are always
the &s;ame: Let the Civil, as well as Religious
Rights of all our Subjects, receive a Confirma|tion
in &s;uch a Parliament; let Con&s;ciences tru|ly
tender be indulged; let Property of every
Kind be better than ever &s;ecured; let an Act
of General Grace and Amne&s;ty, extingui&s;h the
Faults, even of the mo&s;t Guilty; if po&s;&s;ible,
let the very Remembrance of all which have
preceeded this happy Moment, be utterly blot|ted
out, that our Subjects may be united to Us,
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
and to each other, in the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds of Af|fection,
as well as Intere&s;t.'</P>
<P>' And that nothing may be omitted, which is
in Our Power to contribute to this de&s;irable
End; we do, by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, ab&s;olutely
and effectually, for Us, Our Heirs and Suc|ce&s;&s;ors,
Pardon, Remit and Di&s;charge all
Crimes of High-Trea&s;on, Mi&s;pri&s;ion of Trea|&s;on,
and all other Crimes and Offences what|&s;oever
done or committed again&s;t Us, or Our
Royal Father of ble&s;&s;ed Memory, by any of Our
Subjects, of what Degree or Quality &s;oever, who
&s;hall, at, or after Our Landing, and before they
engage in any Action again&s;t Us, or Our For|ces,
from that Time, lay hold on Mercy, and
return to that Duty and Allegiance they owe to
Us, their only Rightful and Lawful Sovereign.'</P>
<P>' By the joint Endeavours of Us and Our Par|liament,
urged by the&s;e Motives, and directed
to the&s;e Views, we may hope to &s;ee the Peace
and Flouri&s;hing E&s;tate of this Kingdom, in a

forward to concert with our Parliament &s;uch
further Mea&s;ures as may be thought nece&s;&s;ary
for leaving the &s;ame to future Generations.'</P>
<P>' And we hereby require all Sheriffs of Shires,
Stewarts of Stewartries, and their Deputies,
and Magi&s;trates of Burghs, to publi&s;h this Our
Declaration, immediately after it &s;hall come
to their Hands, in the u&s;ual Place and Man|ner,

<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Account of what was done
again&s;t tho&s;e in Scotland, who
took Arms there under the
Earl of Argyle, &amp;c. and a|gain&s;t
the Prote&s;tants in Ire|land,
by the late King James,
and his Deputy Tyrconnel.</HEAD>
<P>IT is proper in the next Place, to give a brief
Account how the <HI>Scots,</HI> who took Arms in
their own Country again&s;t the Tyranny
of King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> II. were treat|ed.
There were &s;everal In&s;urrections there, oc|ca&s;ion'd
by the barbarous Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Pre&s;|byterians,
for not conforming to the Tyranny
in Church and State then &s;et up, which they
prote&s;ted they could not in Con&s;cience do, &s;ince
that Government was not only contrary to the
Fundamental Laws of the Nation, but to their
Principles, and the &s;olemn Obligations which
the King and Kingdom lay under by Oaths a|gain&s;t
it; and that it was attended by &s;uch an un|limited
Prerogative given the King by a pack'd
Parliament, as empower'd him by Virtue of his
Supremacy, which they called <HI>an inherent Right</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="58">
<HI>to the Crown,</HI> <Q REND="inline">' That he and his Succe&s;&s;ors might
&s;ettle, enact, and emit &s;uch Con&s;titutions,
Acts, and Orders, concerning the Admini&s;trati|on
of the External Government of the Church,
and the Per&s;ons employed in the &s;ame, and
concerning all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Meetings, and
Matters to be propo&s;ed and determin'd there|in,
as they in their Royal Wi&s;dom &s;hould think
fit.'</Q> The&s;e are the very Words of the fir&s;t Act
of the 2d Se&s;&s;ions of the fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>Charles</HI>
II. and of the fir&s;t Act of the &s;econd Parliament.</P>
<P>To force a Conformity to this &s;ort of Govern|ment
in Church and State, which King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
had &s;olemnly abjur'd at his taking the Crown of
<HI>Scotland</HI> upon him, High Commi&s;&s;ion Courts
were not only &s;et up by the Prerogative, which
acted contrary to Law, but Soldiers were em|ploy'd
to oppre&s;s, pillage, harra&s;s, impri&s;on,
fine, and confine, beat and bind like Bea&s;ts,
tho&s;e who refus'd it. Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> a bloody
and athei&s;tical Man, commanded in three &s;uch
Expeditions again&s;t the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Shires of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in 1663, 1665, and 1666. where he and his
Troops exacted from the poor People of <HI>Galloway</HI>
and <HI>Nith&s;dale,</HI> for their Nonconformity, betwixt
4 and 5000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, be&s;ides the great Charge
they were at by giving free Quarters, and Mo|ney,
to the Soldiers, to forbear the Barbarities
which they practi&s;ed on their Per&s;ons and Fa|milies.
There was al&s;o levied by way of Fine,
without any Crime alledged, from 132 Gentle|men,
and others, near 7000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, be&s;ides
free Quarters to the Soldiers &s;ent to levy it,
which amounted to as much; and notwith&s;tand|ing
the Money which was paid to tho&s;e barbarous
Troops to make them forbear Cruelties, it was
their common Cu&s;tom to de&s;troy all the Provi|&s;ions
<PB N="34" REF="59">
and Sub&s;tance of tho&s;e they quartered upon,
and to fill the Bellies of their Servants and Dogs,
before they would &s;uffer the poor Families to eat
any of their own Provi&s;ions; nor did they be|have
them&s;elves thus only to tho&s;e who did not
conform, but to many Gentlemen and others
who did; it being plainly the De&s;ign of the Court
to ruin the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI>; becau&s;e that Part
of the Kingdom had always, from the Time of
the Reformation, &s;ignalized their Zeal for their
Religion and Liberty. It was u&s;ual with them af|ter
they had ruin'd the Tenants to quarter upon
their Landlords; and thus they harra&s;s'd and
plunder'd that Part of the Country three Times
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the Years above-mention'd: And
be&s;ides the Money thus exacted, they forced Peo|ple
to give Bonds for &s;uch other Sums as they
thought fit, by which they beggar'd abundance
of Families. And when any complain'd to the
commanding Officer of tho&s;e Inhumanities, they
were commonly beaten, or otherwi&s;e barbarou&s;ly
treated. The Soldiers did likewi&s;e behave
them&s;elves &s;o athei&s;tically, that they publickly
mock'd at all Religion, utter'd mo&s;t horrible
Cur&s;es and Oaths, ravi&s;h'd Women, and in &s;hort,
their Behaviour was more like Savages and Pa|gans
than civilized Men and Chri&s;tians: and af|ter
they had thus ruin'd the Country, they extor|ted
Certificates from the People, That they had
been civilly u&s;ed, on purpo&s;e to prevent their
making Application to the Government for Re|dre&s;s;
and when they had nothing left to pay
what the Soldiers demanded, they were barba|rou&s;ly
u&s;ed in their Per&s;ons, and carried to Pri|&s;ons,
tied Hand and Foot, like Bea&s;ts. After
the Country had been 7 Months thus oppre&s;s'd in
Sir <HI>James</HI>'s third Expedition, three Country-men
<PB N="35" REF="60">
met four of his Soldiers carrying a poor old Man,
one of their Neighbours, in that Manner to
<HI>Dumfries</HI>; they begg'd the Soldiers to unty him,
who, in&s;tead of doing it, attack'd the Country|men
with their Swords, but were wor&s;ted in the
Scuffle, one of them wounded, and the other
three threw down their Arms. This encourag'd
the&s;e Men, with &s;ome others, to attack 10 or 12
more of the Soldiers, who were in like manner
oppre&s;&s;ing the People in that &s;ame Pari&s;h, and
the&s;e they al&s;o di&s;armed, having kill'd one that
made an ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance. The Neighbour|hood
knowing that Sir <HI>James</HI> would take a terri|ble
Revenge upon them, about 54 of them took
Hor&s;e, and with a few Footmen marched to
<HI>Dumfries,</HI> where they took Sir <HI>James,</HI> and di&s;|arm'd
his Men. Having done this, they march|ed
to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> where the People were oppre&s;s'd
in the like Manner, and being join'd by others,
came at la&s;t to be 7 or 800. Upon this Lieute|nant
General <HI>Dalzeel</HI> was ordered to march a|gain&s;t
them with the regular Troops, they were
declared Rebels, and order'd to lay down their
Arms within 24 Hours after the Proclamation
was publi&s;hed, without the lea&s;t A&s;&s;urance of
Pardon, and all the Subjects were ordered to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
the General, on pain of Rebellion. This poor
Handful being thus made de&s;perate, they march|ed
within two Miles of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and a Ce&s;&s;a|tion
was agreed between the General and them
for one Night, until their Grievances and Peti|tion
might be pre&s;ented by him to the Council.
This made them &s;ecure, and the General, con|trary
to Agreement, &s;urpriz'd them ju&s;t at the
Time when his Me&s;&s;enger was delivering their
Petition to the Council. They made a &s;tout Re|&s;i&s;tance,
and repuls'd his advanced Troops three

Cold, they were defeated on the 28th of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI>
1666. 40 of 'em kill'd, and above 130 of
them taken, many of whom were executed with
the greate&s;t Cruelty and Barbarity, and &s;ome of
them tortured by an Engine called a Boot, to
make them di&s;cover others, and &s;uch as had gi|ven
them any A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Relief. Be&s;ides, it
was made Trea&s;on for any one to harbour &s;uch
of them as had e&s;caped. This was the fir&s;t In|&s;urrection
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> known by the Name of
<HI>Pentland-Hills,</HI> which was the Place where they
fought.</P>
<P>The&s;e Barbarities &s;erved only to incen&s;e the
Country, and to make the People of the We&s;tern
Shires more aver&s;e to Conformity than before.
This occa&s;ion'd many &s;evere Laws to force them
to a Compliance, which not having the de&s;ign'd
Effect, an Army of barbarous Highlanders was
twice brought down upon the Country, which
they plunder's, treated the People with all &s;ort
of Inhumanity, garri&s;on'd Gentlemen's Hou&s;es
contrary to Law, impos'd Bonds and Oaths upon
the People without Authority of Parliament,
and committed &s;uch other Outrages, as if they
had been in an Enemies Country. But all this
not prevailing with the People to conform, or to
ab&s;tain from Wor&s;hip in the Fields, when they
could not do it in Hou&s;es, Troops were employ|ed
to attack the People where-ever they were a&s;|&s;embled,
which oblig'd them frequently to &s;tand
on their Defence, and all that did &s;o being made
Guilty of Death, this brought on the &s;econd In|&s;urrection
at <HI>Bothwell-bridge,</HI> in 1679. where the
poor oppre&s;&s;ed People being va&s;tly out-number'd
by the King's Army, under the Command of the
<PB N="37" REF="62">
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> about 300 of 'em, after a
&s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance, were kill'd, the re&s;t put to
flight, and above 1000 taken, and carried to <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI>
where they were a long time kept in
an open Church-yard without any Shelter from
Cold or Rain; &s;everal Mini&s;ters and others were
executed, and about 1700 taken there, and at
other Places before, &s;old for Slaves to <HI>America,</HI>
and other Parts, 200 of which were ca&s;t away
near <HI>Orkney,</HI> thro' the Barbarity of the Captain
of the Ship, who order'd them to be kept under
Hatches, when his Ship &s;truck, otherwi&s;e they
might have e&s;caped as well as he, and his Men,
and about 50 others of their Fellow Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Country was made a perfect Scene of Hor|ror
and Cruelty, by the Pur&s;uits which were
made after tho&s;e who e&s;caped from the Field,
and the pro&s;cribing, or putting to Death &s;uch
as were found to give them any Relief, though
their neare&s;t Relations. And Acts were made
to make it Death for any Presbyterian Mini&s;ters
to preach, or People to hear them, in Hou&s;e or
Field.</P>
<P>The&s;e barbarous Oppre&s;&s;ions made a Part of
the People &s;o mad, that &s;ome of them thought
them&s;elves ab&s;olved from giving any further O|bedience
to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ion|ed
under him; and therefore took upon them to
declare, That he had forfeited his Crown by his
Perjury and Tyranny, and that they would no
more own him as their Sovereign. Though this
was known to be contrary to the declared Princi|ples
of the Presbyterians, and perfectly incon&s;i|&s;tent
with what they held them&s;elves to be obli|ged
to by the <HI>Solemn League and Covenant,</HI> which
bound them to maintain the King's ju&s;t Preroga|tive,
and the Authority of Parliaments, from
<PB N="38" REF="63">
whom their Kings derived their Authority, and
without who&s;e Con&s;ent they held they could not
be depriv'd of it; yet the Practice of tho&s;e few
de&s;perate Men was made a Handle to oppre&s;s all
the Presbyterians, and to impo&s;e new Oaths and
Bonds upon them. In the mean time that Hand|ful
of Men who had thus thrown off the King's
Authority, were pur&s;ued from Place to Place,
and kill'd without any Tryal, where-ever they
were found; and the Soldiers had an illegal
Power given them by the Council to tender a
Bond or Oath, to all that they plea&s;ed, to di&s;|own
the Declaration of tho&s;e Men; and if they
refu&s;ed it, they were pre&s;ently to kill them; and
thus they murder'd, without any Trial, about 78
People, in &s;everal Parts of the Country, and in
&s;uch a barbarous Manner, that they would not
allow tho&s;e poor People Time to recommend
them&s;elves to God, before they were &s;hot or
&s;tabb'd, but an&s;wer'd them with this athei&s;tical
Sarca&s;m, <HI>What the Devil have you been doing &s;o
many Years? Ha'n't you had Time enough to pray in
the Caves and Mountains!</HI></P>
<P>The murmuring Faction cannot pretend that
the pre&s;ent Rebels were forced by any &s;uch Ex|tremities
as the&s;e, to take Arms, nor have they
any Ground to complain of any &s;uch Inqui&s;itor|like
Proceedings again&s;t their Friends; and 'tis
well for them 'tis &s;o; otherwi&s;e there had been
&s;uch a Havock long e'er now among the High|Church
Party, that few or none of them would
have been left to belch out Lies and Trea&s;on eve|ry
Day again&s;t the Government.</P>
<P>I come now to the la&s;t In&s;urrection in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
before the Revolution, which was that un|der
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> already mention'd: The
Cau&s;es of it are to be &s;een in his Declaration,
<PB N="39" REF="64">
as above, &s;o that there's little more to be &s;aid of
it, but that his Lord&s;hip not being able to rai&s;e
above 2000 Men, becau&s;e of the Precautions
which the Government had taken again&s;t him
upon the early Notice they had of his De&s;ign, he
only wander'd about for 6 or 7 Weeks, in the
We&s;tern Highlands, where being block'd up by
the King's Men of War, and &s;traiten'd for Pro|vi&s;ions,
abundance of his Men de&s;erted; and com|ing
at la&s;t towards <HI>Dumbarton</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> he
was intercepted by a numerous Army; and his
Men perceiving that the Enemy was ten times
their Number, and being al&s;o wearied out with
long Marches, want of Provi&s;ions, and Sleep,
mo&s;t of them withdrew in the Night, and the
few that kept together, were, after &s;ome Skir|mi&s;hes
with a Party of the Enemy, whom they
defeated, obliged likewi&s;e to di&s;per&s;e; the Earl
him&s;elf, with a few more, were taken, and exe|cuted
at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as about 20 of his Men were
at his Seat at <HI>Innerary</HI> in the Highlands; and ma|ny
others taken up afterwards on Su&s;picion, or o|therwi&s;e,
were bani&s;h'd to <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, That the Earl was not execu|ted
upon the Account of this Rebellion; but be|cau&s;e
of an Explanation which he offered of the
Te&s;t that had been made, for all tho&s;e in Places
of Power and Tru&s;t, when the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion upon the Duke of
<HI>York:</HI> This was &s;o much the more extraordinary,
that &s;everal of the Epi&s;copal Party had been al|low'd
to take it with &s;uch Explanations, becau&s;e
it was contradictory in it &s;elf, and were never
called in que&s;tion for it: But the Rea&s;on why
the Earl was pick'd out to be a Sacrifice, was
the Greatne&s;s of his Quality and Power, which

<P>I come next to take a View of King <HI>James</HI> II's
Admini&s;tration in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Soon after his Acce&s;|&s;ion
to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, he &s;ent that bigotted
Papi&s;t and Tyrant, the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> to be

intere&s;t: Therefore they prayed, That

in his Hands, to the Terror of the Fa|ction,

<P><PB N="41" REF="66">
<HI>Tyrconnel</HI> fully an&s;wered their Expectations,
and in a little Time ca&s;hier'd the Prote&s;tant Ar|my
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of about 7000
Men, and form'd another of Papi&s;ts, mo&s;t of
whom were the De&s;cendants, or near Relations
of tho&s;e that had been attainted for the Rebellion
and Ma&s;&s;acre in 1641, or had &s;ignalized them|&s;elves
by notorious Villanies, and implacable
Hatred to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in
that Nation.</P>
<P>In the next Place he &s;et up Judges there, who
were engaged by Intere&s;t and Inclination to
de&s;troy the Prote&s;tant Religion; and one of
them, called <HI>Rice,</HI> a pro&s;ligate Papi&s;t, who was
advanced to be Lord Chief Baron, had the Im|pudence
to declare, he would draw a Coach and
&s;ix Hor&s;es through the Act of Settlement, which
was the Chief Security the Prote&s;tants had in that
Kingdom. Sir <HI>Alexander Fitton,</HI> who had been
convicted of Forgery at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and
<HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and fin'd for it by the Lords in Parlia|ment,
was taken out of Goal, and made Lord

Papi&s;t; and was &s;o zealous to &s;hew him&s;elf a true

Height of Impudence from the Bench, <HI>That the
Iri&s;h Prote&s;tants were all Rogues, and that there was
not one among</HI> 40000 <HI>of 'em, but was a Traytor, Re|bel
and Villain.</HI></P>
<P>The Privy Council in <HI>Ireland</HI> was compos'd of
a Majority of Papi&s;is; &s;o that the Prote&s;tants na|med
as Members of it, declined to act; becau&s;e
they were &s;en&s;ible that they could do their Religi|on
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t no manner of Service.</P>
<P>There wanted nothing el&s;e but to model a
Hou&s;e of Commons to the De&s;igns of the Court,
and in order to that the Charters of all Corpora|tions
<PB N="42" REF="67">
were &s;eiz'd by <HI>Quo Warranto</HI>'s, without a|ny
Cau&s;e or Shadow of Law; &s;o that the Magi|&s;tracies
of Corporations were fill'd up with Pa|pi&s;ts,
and Men of de&s;perate, or no Fortunes; and
the new Charters had a Clau&s;e by which the
chief Governour was impower'd to turn out and
put in whom he plea&s;ed, without &s;hewing a Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>The
Prote&s;tant Clergy were oppre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Tyr|connel,</HI>
and the Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts did openly demand
the Tythes belonging to them, and forbad their
People to pay the Tythes to the Prote&s;tant In|cumbents,
on Pain of Damnation. This pa&s;s'd
afterwards into an Act, by which the Papi&s;ts
were to pay their Tythes only to their own
Prie&s;ts; and afterwards, as any Prote&s;tant Bi|&s;hop
or Clergyman died, Papi&s;ts were put into
their Places by the King's Privy Signet, or Sign
Manual.</P>
<P>In the next Place <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> &s;topp'd the Salaries
of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin,</HI> becau&s;e they would
not, contrary to the Laws and their Oaths, admit
a vicious ignorant Papi&s;t into a vacant Fellow|&s;hip;
and when King <HI>James</HI> arrived there after
the Revolution, the Prote&s;tant Vice Pre&s;ident,
Fellows and Scholars, were all turn'd out, their
Furniture, Library, Communion Plate, and e|very
thing belonging to the College was taken a|way,
the Hou&s;e made a Garri&s;on, and their
Chambers made Pri&s;ons for Prote&s;tants; tho'
King <HI>James</HI> had promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve their
Liberties and Properties, and rather augment
than dimini&s;h the Privileges which had been
granted them by his Predece&s;&s;ors. At la&s;t mo&s;t
of the Churches in and about <HI>Dublin,</HI> were &s;eiz'd
on by the Government, and an Order was i&s;&s;u|ed,
forbidding more than 5 Prote&s;tants to meet,
<PB N="43" REF="68">
under Pain of Death, &s;o that all religious A&s;&s;em|blies
through the whole Kingdom, were prohi|bited
to Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>To complete their Ruin, an Act of Attainder
was pa&s;s'd in Parliament, in order to which, eve|ry
Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons returned
the Names of all &s;uch Prote&s;tant Gentlemen as
lived near them, or in the County or Borough
for which he &s;erved; or if he was a Stranger to
any of them, he &s;ent to the Country for Infor|mation
about them. When the Bill was pre&s;ent|ed
to the King for his A&s;&s;ent, the Speaker told
him, That many were attainted in that Act up|on
&s;uch Evidence as &s;atisfied the Hou&s;e, and the
re&s;t upon Common Fame.</P>
<P>In this Act, no fewer were attainted than two
Archbi&s;hops, one Duke, 17 Earls, 7 Counte&s;&s;es,
28 Vi&s;counts, 2 Vi&s;counte&s;&s;es, 7 Bi&s;hops, 18 Ba|rons,
33 Baronets, 51 Knights, 83 Clergymen,
2182 E&s;quires and Gentlemen, <HI>and all of 'em un|heard,</HI>
declared and adjudged Traytors, convict|ed
and attainted of High-Trea&s;on, and adjudged
to &s;uffer the Pains of Death and For&s;eiture. The
famous Pro&s;cription of <HI>Rome</HI> during the la&s;t Tri|umvirate,
came not up in &s;ome Re&s;pects to the
Horror of this; for there were condemned in this
little Kingdom more than double the Number
that were pro&s;cribed through the va&s;t Bounds of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. And to make this of <HI>Ireland</HI>
yet the more terrible, and to put the Per&s;ons at|tainted
out of a Po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, the Act
it &s;elf was concealed, and no Prote&s;tant allow'd a
Copy of it, till four Months after it was pa&s;t:
Whereas in that of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Names of the Per|&s;ons
pro&s;cribed were affixed upon all the publick
Places of the City, and the very Day the Pro&s;crip|tion
was concerted; and thereby Opportunity
<PB N="44" REF="69">
was given to many of the noble&s;t Families in

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>LET our Murmerers &s;peak from their Con|&s;ciences,
if they have any: Can the mo&s;t

there is not a very great Difference betwixt the
Cau&s;e of tho&s;e who took Arms again&s;t Tyranny
and Popery in the three Nations, during the
Reigns of King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> II. and
of &s;uch as have taken Arms to &s;et up an Impo&s;tor,

of <HI>France,</HI> and Idolatry of <HI>Rome,</HI> and tho&s;e who

<P>And as the Difference betwixt the Cau&s;es is
remarkable, the Difference betwixt the Conduct

charge the <HI>Whigs</HI> in tho&s;e Reigns to have
join'd with Papi&s;ts in pulling down Places of
Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip, whil&s;t Ma&s;s-Hou&s;es pa&s;s'd

in order to interrupt the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice a|gain&s;t
an Incendiary, for preaching Sedition and
Trea&s;on? Can they be charged with a Rebelli|on

betrayed their Religion, their Liberty, their

Sea&s;on by Hundreds together, and left to &s;trave,
as tho&s;e that were taken at <HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge in
<HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>Let them next take a Tour to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
find out In&s;tances there, where the Pretender's
Friends have been attainted in Parliament upon
Common Fame, and the Act concealed that they
might have no Opportunity to make their E&s;|cape.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="73">
A great deal more might be &s;aid of the Inhu|man
and Barbarous Proceedings of tho&s;e Reigns;
but this is more than enough to convict our Mur|murers
of Fal&s;hood, who cry out again&s;t the
gentle Methods of Ju&s;tice now made u&s;e of to
puni&s;h &s;uch as have rais'd the mo&s;t unnatural and
ill-grounded Rebellion that was ever heard of up|on
Earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with one Rebuke to the Jaco|bite
Females, who take upon them to make
Trea&s;on their ordinary Tattle, that 'tis well for
them that they don't live under &s;uch an Admi|ni&s;tration,
as that of <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>James</HI> II. in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
when poor Country Girls were hang'd with|out
Mercy, for &s;aying that <HI>Charles</HI> had forfeited
his Title to the Crown by breaking the Original
Contract, or Covenant, on which he took it, and
that <HI>James</HI> being a profe&s;s'd Papi&s;t, had no Right
to the Crown, becau&s;e it was coutrary to the
Fundamental Laws of the Nation, and particu|larly
that of King <HI>James</HI> VI. which obliged al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
their Princes to &s;wear at their Coronation that
they were Prote&s;tants, would maintain that Reli|gion,
as then e&s;tabli&s;hed, and aboli&s;h all fal&s;e
Religion, Idolatry, and Here&s;y. I would al&s;o
advi&s;e tho&s;e Jacobite Ladies who make &s;o bold
with the pre&s;ent Government at their Tea-Ta|bles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and di&s;cover &s;o much Inclination to fa|vour
the Rebels, to remember what the Lady
<HI>Li&s;le,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Gaunt</HI> &s;uffer'd, for Crimes of a
far le&s;s Nature in the Eye of the Law, as it then
&s;tood, or rather was wre&s;ted.</P>
