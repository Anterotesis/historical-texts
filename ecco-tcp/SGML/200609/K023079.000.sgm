<HEAD>THE
DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING propo&s;ed to write &s;ome Pieces on Hu|man
Life and Manners, &s;uch as (to u&s;e my Lord
<HI>Bacon</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>come home to Men's Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
and Bo&s;oms,</HI> I thought it more &s;atisfactory to begin
with con&s;idering <HI>Man</HI> in the Ab&s;tract, his <HI>Nature</HI> and
his <HI>State</HI>: &s;ince to prove any moral Duty, to inforce any
moral Precept, or to examine the Perfection or Imperfe|ction
of any Creature what&s;oever, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to
know what <HI>Condition</HI> and <HI>Relation</HI> it is placed in, and
what is the proper <HI>End</HI> and <HI>Purpo&s;e</HI> of its <HI>Being.</HI></P>
<P>The Science of Human Nature is, like all other Scien|ces,
reduced to a <HI>few, clear Points</HI>: There are not many
<HI>certain Truths</HI> in this World. It is therefore in the Ana|tomy
of the Mind as in that of the Body; more Good will
accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and
perceptible parts, than by &s;tudying too much &s;uch finer
nerves and ve&s;&s;els as will for ever e&s;cape our ob&s;ervation.
The <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> are all upon the&s;e la&s;t, and I will ven|ture
<PB REF="5">
to &s;ay, they have le&s;s &s;harpen'd the <HI>Wits</HI> than the
<HI>Hearts</HI> of Men again&s;t each other, and have dimini&s;hed
the Practi&s;e, more than advanced the Theory, of Mora|lity.
If I could flatter my &s;elf that this E&s;&s;ay has any
Merit, it is in &s;teering betwixt Doctrines &s;eemingly op|po&s;ite,
in pa&s;&s;ing over Terms utterly un-intelligible, and
in forming out of all a <HI>temperate</HI> yet not <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent,</HI>
and a <HI>&s;hort</HI> yet not <HI>imperfect</HI> Sy&s;tem of Ethics.</P>
<P>This I might have done in Pro&s;e; but I cho&s;e Ver&s;e,
and even Rhyme, for two rea&s;ons. The one will ap|pear
obvious; that Principles, Maxims, or Precepts
&s;o written, both &s;trike the reader more &s;trongly at fir&s;t,
and are more ea&s;ily retained by him afterwards. The
other may &s;eem odd but is true; I found I could ex|pre&s;s
them more <HI>&s;hortly</HI> this way than in Pro&s;e it&s;elf,
and nothing is more certain than that much of the <HI>Force</HI>
as well as <HI>Grace</HI> of Arguments or In&s;tructions depends
on their Conci&s;ene&s;s. I was unable to treat this part
of my &s;ubject more in <HI>detail,</HI> without becoming dry and
tedious; or more <HI>poetically,</HI> without &s;acrificing Per&s;pi|cuity
to Ornament, without wandring from the Preci&s;ion,
or breaking the Chain of Rea&s;oning. If any man can unite
all the&s;e, without diminution of any of them, I freely con|fe&s;s
he will compa&s;s a thing above my capacity.</P>
<P>What is now publi&s;hed, is only to be con&s;idered as a ge|neral
<HI>Map</HI> of <HI>MAN,</HI> marking out no more than the <HI>Greater</HI>
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Parts,</HI> their <HI>Extent,</HI> their <HI>Limits,</HI> and their <HI>Connection,</HI>
but leaving the Particular to be more fully delineated in
the Charts which are to follow. Con&s;equently, the&s;e Epi&s;tles
in their progre&s;s will become le&s;s dry, and more &s;u&s;ceptible
of Poetical Ornament. I am here only opening the <HI>Foun|tains,</HI>
and clearing the pa&s;&s;age; To deduce the <HI>Rivers,</HI> to
follow them in their Cour&s;e, and to ob&s;erve their Effects,
will be a task more agreeable.</P>

<LIST>
<LABEL>EPISTLE I. Of the NATURE and STATE of MAN, with
re&s;pect to the UNIVERSE.</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>OF <HI>Man</HI> in the <HI>Ab&s;tract.</HI> We can judge only with regard
to our <HI>own Sy&s;tem,</HI> being ignorant of the <HI>Relations</HI> of Sy|&s;tems
and Things, VER. 17, &amp;c. to 68. Man is not
therefore to be deem'd <HI>Imperfect,</HI> but a Being &s;uited to his <HI>Place</HI>
and <HI>Rank</HI> in the Creation, agreeable to the <HI>General Order</HI> of
Things, and conformable to <HI>Ends</HI> and <HI>Relations</HI> to him unknown.
69, &amp;c. It is partly upon this <HI>Ignorance</HI> of future Events, and
partly upon the <HI>Hope</HI> of a Future State, that all his Happine&s;s in
the pre&s;ent depends, 73, &amp;c. His <HI>Pride,</HI> in aiming at more <HI>Know|ledge</HI>
and pretending to more <HI>Perfection,</HI> the cau&s;e of his Error
and Mi&s;ery, 109. 119. The <HI>Impiety</HI> of putting him&s;elf in the
<PB REF="8">
place of <HI>God,</HI> and judging of the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s, perfection
or imperfection, ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of his di&s;pen&s;ations, 109 <HI>to</HI>
120. The <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of conceiting him&s;elf the <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> of the
creation, or expecting that Perfection in the <HI>moral</HI> world which
is not in the <HI>natural,</HI> 127 <HI>to</HI> 164. The <HI>Unrea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of his
complaints again&s;t Providence, while on the one hand he demands
the perfections of the Angels, on the other the bodily qualifica|tions
of the Brutes, 165. That the gift of <HI>Rea&s;on alone</HI> counter|vails
all the latter, and that to po&s;&s;e&s;s any of the <HI>&s;en&s;itive faculties</HI> in
a higher degree, would render him mi&s;erable, 181 <HI>to</HI> 198. That
throughout the whole vi&s;ible world, an univer&s;al <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>gra|dation</HI>
in the&s;e is ob&s;erv'd, which cau&s;es a <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> of crea|ture
to creature, and of all creatures of man. The gradations of
<HI>&s;en&s;e, in&s;tinct, thought, reflection, rea&s;on,</HI> 199 <HI>to</HI> 224. How
much <HI>farther</HI> this order and &s;ubordination of living creatures may
extend, above and below us? 225. Were any <HI>part</HI> of this bro|ken,
not that part only, but the <HI>whole</HI> connected <HI>Creation</HI> mu&s;t be
de&s;troyed. The extravagance, madne&s;s, and pride of &s;uch a de|&s;ire,
239, &amp;c. Con&s;equently, the ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to Pro|vidence,
both as to our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and <HI>future</HI> &s;tate, 292, &amp;c.</P></ITEM>

<HI>to</HI> 150. its <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> in directing men to different purpo&s;es, 153,
&amp;c. its <HI>providential u&s;e,</HI> in fixing our <HI>principle,</HI> and a&s;certaining
our <HI>virtue,</HI> 167. <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> join'd in our <HI>mixt nature</HI>;
the limits <HI>near,</HI> yet the things <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> and <HI>evident.</HI> What is the
office of <HI>Rea&s;on?</HI> 187, &amp;c. How odious <HI>Vice</HI> in it&s;elf, and how
we deceive our &s;elves into it, 209. That however, the <HI>Ends</HI> of
<HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>general Good</HI> are an&s;wer'd in our <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>Im|perfections,</HI>
230, &amp;c. How u&s;efully the&s;e are di&s;tributed to all
<HI>Orders of men,</HI> 233. how u&s;eful they are to <HI>Society,</HI> 241. and to
the <HI>Individuals,</HI> 253. In every <HI>State,</HI> and in every <HI>Age</HI> of life,

<ITEM><P><HI>HAppine&s;s</HI> ill defin'd by the Philo&s;ophers, VER. 19. That it
is the <HI>End</HI> of all men, and attainable by all, 28. God go|verns
by <HI>general,</HI> not <HI>particular</HI> laws: intends Happine&s;s to be <HI>equal</HI>;
and to be &s;o it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ocial,</HI> &s;ince all particular happine&s;s de|pends
on general, 35. As it is nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Order,</HI> and the peace
and welfare of <HI>Society,</HI> that <HI>External goods</HI> &s;hould be <HI>unequal,</HI> hap|pine&s;s
is not made to con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e, 47. But, notwith&s;tand|ing
that inequality, the Balance of Happine&s;s among mankind is
kept even by Providence, by the two Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> 66.
What the happine&s;s of Individuals is? as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with
the con&s;titution of this world, 76. That the <HI>good man</HI> has here
the advantage, 80. The error of imputing to <HI>Virtue</HI> what are
only the calamities of <HI>Nature,</HI> or of <HI>Fortune,</HI> 92. The folly of
expecting that God &s;hould alter his General Laws in favour of par|ticulars,
118. That we are not judges <HI>who are good?</HI> but that
whoever they are, they mu&s;t be <HI>happie&s;t,</HI> 130, &amp;c. That <HI>ex|ternal</HI>
<PB REF="11">
<HI>goods</HI> are not the proper rewards, often incon&s;i&s;tent with,
or de&s;tructive of <HI>Virtue,</HI> 166. But that even the&s;e can make no
man happy without Virtue. In&s;tanced in Riches, 176. Ho|nours,
184. Birth, 203. Greatne&s;s, 213. Fame, 233. Supe|rior
talents, 257. with pictures of human Infelicity in men po&s;|&s;e&s;t
of them all, 275, &amp;c. That VIRTUE ONLY con&s;titutes a Hap|pine&s;s,
who&s;e Object is <HI>univer&s;al</HI> 311. and who&s;e Pro&s;pect <HI>eter|nal,</HI>
345. The perfection of which con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>conformity</HI> to
the <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> here, and in a <HI>re&s;ignation</HI> to it, here and
hereafter, 534. Or (in other words) in <HI>Love of God</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI>
