<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE common error of mo&s;t of our modern writers on beauty has been, that they have &s;uppo&s;ed all things, in order to appear completely beautiful, &s;ubject to one fixed prin|ciple relative only to &s;en&s;e; &s;uch as, &s;hape or proportion. Books have been written in &s;upport of uni|formity and variety; terms compre|hending the nature of all things, ra|ther than containing a de&s;cription alone of what is beautiful: others to per&s;uade us in favour of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s, and of a &s;erpentine line of beauty. Propriety has al&s;o been a&s;&s;igned as the cau&s;e of beauty: but, &s;ince there are many things which &s;trike us as beautiful before we di&s;cern their u&s;efulne&s;s, propriety can at be&s;t be admitted a concomi|tant,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
not an efficient cau&s;e, of beau|ty. Concerning matters of ta&s;te, we appeal to the feelings of the heart, rather than to the abilities of the head. Ta&s;te prevents judgment, and is more beholden to &s;entiment than to experience. There is, however, a perfect agreement between right rea|&s;on and true ta&s;te: they are recipro|cal te&s;ts of each other's validity; &s;ince we are not &s;atisfied that &s;uch things plea&s;e, but are apt to inquire into the cau&s;es and effects of this plea&s;ure be|fore we allow its authenticity. This has led many to believe, that beauty depends on propriety or fitne&s;s; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, a toad is as fit for the purpo&s;es of its nature as a turtle-dove: and we may remark of artificial ornaments, that they are mo&s;tly of little or no utility. Nei|ther is beauty it&s;elf the &s;ame with
<PB N="7" REF="5">
goodne&s;s; but rather what is plea|&s;ing to &s;en&s;e, a&s;&s;ociated with an expre&s;&s;ion of goodne&s;s. To define beauty by &s;oftne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s, and the doctrine of mere lines, is re|ducing it to the notion of &s;imple &s;en|&s;ation; but &s;urely one may &s;ee and hear, without the perceptions of beau|ty and harmony peculiar to delicacy of &s;entiment? For whatever beauty we may perceive in the &s;ubordinate objects of &s;en&s;e, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, it is an expre&s;&s;ion of the finer pa&s;|&s;ions, to which we owe the highe&s;t plea&s;ures of beauty. And as it is the &s;ocial or communicative principle which rai&s;es our enjoyments &s;o far above the plea&s;ures of other creatures, &s;o it is the vi&s;ible &s;igns appropriated by nature to this principle, which render the human body &s;uperior|ly beautiful.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the GENERAL SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>QUALITIES of objects, &s;o far as they relate to beauty, are either &s;uch as mo&s;t clearly excite <HI>perception</HI> or <HI>life</HI> in the &s;en&s;es; or they are compo&s;ed of the&s;e, and &s;omewhat <HI>expre&s;&s;ive</HI> of <HI>life</HI> or <HI>&s;en|&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">As the natural love of life, or the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence, is the foun|dation of all animal-plea&s;ure; &s;o the fir&s;t and &s;imple&s;t of our &s;en&s;ations, and of which our primary ideas are chiefly compounded, are light, &s;ound, and motion. Their oppo&s;ites, dark|ne&s;s, &s;ilence, and re&s;t, are con&s;e|quently expre&s;&s;ive of horror, on ac|count of their &s;imilarity to the pri|vation of &s;ight and of hearing, or to the extinction of tho&s;e perceptions which principally con&s;titute the &s;im|ple idea of animation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<HEAD>SECT. II. Of LIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the powers of &s;en&s;e may be referred to that of feeling; all the perceptible qualities of bodies may be re&s;olved into motion. Sight is the feeling of the eye; its percep|tions depend on the vibrations of &s;ome finer medium, which produce the &s;en&s;ation of light. The greate&s;t beauty of light, as confined to &s;en&s;e, &s;eems to be the oppo&s;ition of its three principal modifications, red, blue, and yellow; or their various changes and gentle gradations, as they are ex|hibited in the feathers of a peacock,
<PB N="12" REF="10">
the pri&s;m, or the rainbow: a &s;pecies of which we al&s;o perceive in flowers, and to which they are much beholden for their tender effect.</P>
<P>Colours are beautiful or plea&s;ing as their various contra&s;ts yield a livelier &s;en&s;ation of light, and heighten per|ception; the colder tints, and tho&s;e that approach to darkne&s;s, improving the lighter, and &s;uch as are expre&s;|&s;ive of warmth and of life.</P>
<P>So far as the effects of light or darkne&s;s apply to the expre&s;&s;ion of human character, we may ob&s;erve, that, in the turbulent agitations of the mind, the features accumulate a greater degree of &s;hade; the counte|nance
<PB N="13" REF="11">
a&s;&s;umes a dark and cloudy appearance. Gloomy, livid, and black, are complexions &s;uitable to horror, de&s;pair, and death.</P>
<P>Our ideas of light, and of heat, are originally and clo&s;ely connected. That etherial fire which is the life, is al&s;o the light, of the world. The mellow and amber-coloured light, &s;uch as is &s;ometimes &s;een in a &s;erene evening-&s;ky, while it is mo&s;t delicious to &s;ight, is, of all colours, mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the whole&s;ome de|gree of warmth congenial to life, or to the kindly and delicious of pa&s;|&s;ion; e&s;pecially when contra&s;ted by its oppo&s;ite, black, or deep violet.
<PB N="14" REF="12">
The blui&s;h pale of the human coun|tenance, proper to expre&s;&s;ions of fear, conveys an idea of coldne&s;s; and is that of chilly winter, or of &s;haded &s;now. An appearance of violent heat, is expre&s;&s;ive of the violence of pa&s;&s;ion. Anger is denoted by a deep and fiery red. The thunder is thrown by the red right-hand of JOVE.<Q><L>&mdash;while his thunders dire,</L><L>With red right-hand, at his own temples hurl'd,</L><L>With fear and horror &s;hook the guilty world.</L> <BIBL>FRANCIS'S HORACE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Mellow and gentle tones of colour a&s;&s;ociate with, and di&s;po&s;e to, the gentle and delicate of internal feel|ing; har&s;h and &s;harp ones, with
<PB N="15" REF="13">
rude and di&s;agreeable emotions. Faint, pale, and blui&s;h tints, are fitted to expre&s;s fearfulne&s;s, and a dimi|nution of the powers of life: &s;trong and fiery ones, to &s;ignify pa&s;&s;ions of a &s;trong and contrary nature; the violent of the &s;en&s;es ever a&s;&s;ociating with, and di&s;po&s;ing to, the violent or di&s;agreeable of internal &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>This analogy might al&s;o be traced in the operations of the other &s;en&s;es, &s;melling, ta&s;ting, and feeling. Things that are in&s;ipid to ta&s;te, that dull the palate, or act on it with violence, are ever ungrateful. That certain degree of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s, that gen|tle re&s;i&s;tance, by means of which we
<PB N="16" REF="14">
be&s;t perceive, will ever be mo&s;t agree|able to feeling. Smells al&s;o may be ranged under the volatile or lively, and the dull. Be&s;ide the &s;leep|cau&s;ing quality of the poppy when taken into the &s;tomach, the &s;mell is heavy and deleterious; all &s;uch &s;mells, therefore, will a&s;&s;ociate with &s;ilence, re&s;t, darkne&s;s, and vacuity. Bitter or &s;our things that violently a&s;tringe the palate, things har&s;h to the touch, or that are too &s;trong for &s;melling, affect the ho&s;tile or di&s;cordant of pa&s;|&s;ion. But as ideas of beauty chiefly refer to perceptions of &s;ight and of hearing, we &s;hall confine our reflec|tions particularly to tho&s;e &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="15">It is remarkable, there is a clo&s;e analogy between the principal &s;igns of life, and the &s;imple or primary ob|jects of &s;en&s;e; the chief characteri&s;tics of life being heat, voice, and motion: &s;o that, &s;trictly &s;peaking, whatever objects &s;ugge&s;t the &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to the qualities we perceive in our|&s;elves, are the actual and principal cau&s;es of plea&s;ure even in the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>It is light alone by which the eye enjoys its plea&s;ures of perception; it is light, again, reflected from the eye, to which it owes its &s;uperior vivacity and expre&s;&s;ion. A gentle, yet clear, variation of colour or form, is plea|&s;ing to &s;ight, as that of &s;ound is to
<PB N="18" REF="16">
hearing; and it is by means of &s;uch variations that we communicate our &s;entiments of plea&s;ure.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of SOUND.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that &s;ound is one of the fir&s;t or &s;imple &s;en&s;ations; and that an idea of perfect &s;ilence is accompanied with horror, e&s;pecially when con|joined with darkne&s;s and univer&s;al re&s;t, as the&s;e are analogous to the ne|gation of &s;en&s;e: we &s;hall therefore pa&s;s to the con&s;ideration of &s;ympho|ny,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
or the variations of &s;ound as they are exemplified in mu&s;ical ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of &s;ounds, the mellow, &s;oft, and gentle, are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to &s;en&s;e, and be&s;t adapted to expre&s;s the gentle of &s;entiment. Deep tones a&s;&s;ociate with deepne&s;s of &s;hade, and with &s;lowne&s;s of motion. The loud, the &s;harp, and the &s;hrill, rank with the other ruder cau&s;es of perception.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t refined melody is that which accords with gracefulne&s;s of &s;entiment: it is chiefly employed in quieting the turbulent, and &s;oothing the gentler, emotions. The coar&s;er pa&s;&s;ions are excited by &s;omething
<PB N="20" REF="18">
that de&s;erves the name of noi&s;e or di&s;cord, rather than of mu&s;ic. As the violent emotions increa&s;e, &s;en&s;ibi|lity is dimini&s;hed; as the gentler ones increa&s;e, &s;entiment is improved.</P>
<P>In common di&s;cour&s;e, which treats of indifferent &s;ubjects, and con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of narrative, the voice natu|rally inclines to a &s;ettled monotony, or at be&s;t ri&s;es to a &s;ort of recitative: as conver&s;ation becomes more ani|mated, the variations of voice are proportionally increa&s;ed. Artificial mu&s;ic is an imitation of the&s;e natural variations, as they are more or le&s;s expre&s;&s;ive of pa&s;&s;ion, or of all tho&s;e tender depre&s;&s;ions and rapturous ele|vations
<PB N="21" REF="19">
of the &s;oul, when the pours her&s;elf forth in generous ec&s;ta&s;y: tho&s;e notes and combinations which plea&s;e the ear, being adapted to the plea&s;ing of pa&s;&s;ion; the &s;ad and di&s;|cordant, as in the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, to &s;et off the more melodious and cheerful: for our joys are continually mingled with abatement or with &s;or|row, and are be&s;t perceived by a cer|tain degree of contra&s;t; gravity of &s;ound being an approach to &s;ilence, as &s;hade to darkne&s;s, and as &s;lowne&s;s of motion is a drawing nearer to re&s;t. We cannot judge of any thing but by relation, and it is in the <HI>changes</HI> of things that we perceive them.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="22" REF="20">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of MOTION.</HEAD>
<P>CIRCULAR and changing &s;hapes are &s;emblative of motion, as mo|tion is of life. The poets, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h clear running water from that which is at re&s;t, emphatically attri|bute life to the former: <Q><L>And bid the handmaids for the &s;ea&s;t prepare,</L><L>The &s;eats to range, the fragrant wood to bring,</L><L>And limpid water from the <HI>living</HI> &s;pring.</L> <BIBL>POPE'S HOM. ODYSSEY.</BIBL></Q>  An ellip&s;is or parabola may not im|properly be defined, A line who&s;e di|rection is continually changing; tho' the figure be really permanent, and
<PB N="23" REF="21">
it is evidently the eye which chan|ges. Milton, to expre&s;s the winding &s;hape of the honey&s;uckle, calls it <HI>the flaunting honey&s;uckle.</HI> Thus, beauty of figure becomes a kind of &s;ub&s;ti|tute for elegance of motion.</P>
<P>To the mo&s;t delicate &s;entiments there are certain kindred forms, &s;ounds, and motions, which natural|ly a&s;&s;ociate with, and are be&s;t calcu|lated to expre&s;s, &s;uch tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment. As it is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, alike whether the eye or the ob|ject moves, and it is plain that quick turnings in animals indicate a more &s;udden exertion of the living power than &s;low ones, it will likewi&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="22">
follow, that wherever the eye over|takes lines running abruptly into contrary directions, &s;uch lines will convey an idea of the &s;udden changes of pa&s;&s;ion; though it is not they that move, but the fight which moves along them; &s;ince every appearance we have experienced to hold an al|liance with life, transferring the emotion to the cau&s;e, we are apt to conceive is in&s;pired with pa&s;&s;ion: thus we &s;ay, light is cheerful, mo|tion is &s;prightly, or &s;ounds are pa|thetic.</P>
<P>Bodies apparently ma&s;&s;y and opake are under&s;tood to be heavy, to affect re&s;t, and con&s;equently &s;ilence. The
<PB N="25" REF="23">
<HI>too much</HI> is as incomprehen&s;ible as the <HI>too little,</HI> and a certain degree of greatne&s;s &s;trikes us much in the &s;ame manner as vacuity: thus the ideas of va&s;t magnitude, ob&s;curity, gravity, and &s;tillne&s;s, will ever naturally in|cline to a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>The determination of bodies up|wards is accompanied with a &s;enti|ment of liberty and &s;prightline&s;s. The ri&s;ing foliage of the Corinthian capital makes the column &s;eem to bear its &s;uper&s;tructure, not only with ea&s;e, but with cheerfulne&s;s. Symp|toms of elevated pa&s;&s;ion are, the head thrown up, the arms rai&s;ed above the head, like tho&s;e Bacchanalian fi|gures
<PB N="26" REF="24">
we &s;ee &s;o often repre&s;ented in the antique. Humility and depre&s;|&s;ion of &s;pirit are expre&s;&s;ed by mo|tions of a contrary and li&s;tle&s;s kind, or rather by languor and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of action.</P>
<P>The coar&s;er and more violent pa&s;|&s;ions are to be expre&s;&s;ed by rudene&s;s and extravagance of motion, abrupt changes of form and of colour. Sud|den turnings and contortions are ef|fects of pain, or belong to the extra|vagance of pa&s;&s;ion. An action ener|getic, yet gentle, is appropriated to emotions of the highe&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic has al&s;o its counterpart in action: dancing is the mu&s;ic of mo|tion.
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Mu&s;ic and dancing expre&s;s the &s;ame thing, only in different ways: the art of dancing teaches to regulate the various movements and ge&s;tures of the body to the humour of the mu&s;ic, both an&s;wering to the &s;entiment by which they are mu|tually in&s;pired.</P>
<P>And in this way even inanimate matter, either by being put in mo|tion, or &s;o ordered as to invite the eye to move, is made to engage the attention, and to affect the pa&s;&s;ions, agreeable to the &s;igns of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions in our&s;elves; whence all our ideas of form originate, and whither al&s;o they return by reflection.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="28" REF="26">
<HEAD>SECT. V. Of ASSIMILATION.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH we have no percep|tions but what originate from our &s;en&s;es, yet &s;till it is life which plea&s;es, whether enjoyed by the &s;trong and clear images of &s;en&s;e, or whether the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e, mingling into &s;entimental harmony, are at|tended with the more refined plea|&s;ures of imagination; our ideas, by <HI>a&s;&s;imilation</HI> and <HI>contra&s;t,</HI> improving in &s;trength, mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, and increa&s;ing affection, till at length we attain the highe&s;t ex|cellence of <HI>moral perception.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="27">What is generally under&s;tood by harmony, relates properly to hear|ing; but there is in nature, or ra|ther in the human mind, a &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al &s;ymphony carried on by means of a&s;&s;imilation and contra&s;t, &s;ince there is an attractive as well as a repelling power in every thing that concerns our &s;entiments and &s;en&s;a|tions.</P>
<P>The theory of a&s;&s;ociation may be divided into the agreement of ob|jects or qualities re&s;pecting any &s;ingle &s;en&s;e; among various &s;en&s;es; of tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e with characters of expre&s;|&s;ion; and among various characters, animated or expre&s;&s;ive.&mdash;Thus, as an
<PB N="30" REF="28">
in&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind, gentlene&s;s of form, of colour, and of motion, incline to a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>Things that accord with re&s;pect to different &s;en&s;es, are &s;uch as excite an equal degree of perception, or a like degree of animation; every thing that is delicate to touch, accompa|nied with that particular &s;hape, co|louring, and modulation of &s;ound, which agree to form an a&s;&s;emblage that is gently engaging. The &s;weet, &s;oft notes of the aeolian harp admi|rably agree with the &s;till &s;oftne&s;s of moon-light. The agreeable of co|lour, figure, &s;mell, and touch, are united by nature in flowers; which
<PB N="31" REF="29">
is the rea&s;on they are &s;o delicately plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>When more of the &s;en&s;es than one are employed at the &s;ame time, they naturally act in uni&s;on; and their dif|ferent powers are to be con&s;idered as tending to excite unity of &s;entiment: to &s;et them in oppo&s;ition, therefore, would be to de&s;troy the uniformity and energy of their effect.</P>
<P>Things of different kinds a&s;&s;ociate by &s;ome particular and &s;triking &s;imi|litude; things of like general di&s;po|&s;ition, by &s;ome peculiar difference or contra&s;t. Human characters being included in this la&s;t kind, a&s;&s;ociate by their diver&s;ity of expre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="32" REF="30">
Trees, &s;hrubs, and plants, are to be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of le&s;s perfect characters; and there is an agreement between a proper a&s;|&s;emblage of the&s;e and human cha|racters, or their particular virtues or pa&s;&s;ions per&s;onified: every thing of the clear or animated kind &s;eem|ing to attract that which is expre&s;|&s;ive, in any degree, of a like di&s;po|&s;ition; and to form a whole, that, by means of its variety or internal con|tra&s;ts, yields the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t perfect object of perception.</P>
<P>What plea&s;es any one &s;en&s;e, comes as it were recommended to the re&s;t. What is beautiful, we are di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="33" REF="31">
to think is good; what is good, beau|tiful. Though here we mu&s;t pro|perly di&s;tingui&s;h between the good, and the beautiful; between notions of whole&s;omene&s;s or utility, and that which produces an immediate &s;en&s;a|tion of plea&s;ure. Re&s;pecting the latter, we appeal more directly to the innate and original powers of &s;en&s;e: for the former, to experience; which teaches us, that what is mo&s;t beautiful is not ever the be&s;t, nor that which is le&s;s beholden to fa|vour always the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s or per|nicious. The perpendicular wall of a hou&s;e is good, becau&s;e it implies &s;tability; but it is not therefore
<PB N="34" REF="32">
beautiful: on the contrary, the or|namental part &s;trikes us not as be|ing any otherwi&s;e u&s;eful than that it immediately plea&s;es. The wither|ed leaves of plants frequently exhi|bit a colouring more agreeable to the eye, than when they are fre&s;h and blooming. The &s;moke i&s;&s;uing from the chimney of a country cot|tage cannot, &s;urely, be under&s;tood to po&s;&s;e&s;s any great appearance of beauty; but the object plea&s;es, be|cau&s;e it conveys a lively idea of the &s;nug happine&s;s and warmth of the people within. Other objects, tho' really good or u&s;eful, have nothing in them very plea&s;ing to &s;en&s;e, nei|ther
<PB N="35" REF="33">
do they bear any external marks of &s;en&s;ibility, and therefore cannot be &s;aid to partake of beauty. Even with regard to the human character, we do not find that virtue ever ac|companies the faire&s;t form.</P>
<P>Things that are a&s;&s;ociated, by ha|bit, with plea&s;ing objects, though in them&s;elves not agreeable, become, by &s;uch habitual a&s;&s;ociation, plea|&s;ing, provided the balance be on the agreeable &s;ide; but. the lineal and &s;peckled beauty of the &s;erpent will not ea&s;ily command our attention, &s;o long as the horror continues with which that animal &s;trikes us.</P>
<P>With a lively &s;entiment, lively
<PB N="36" REF="34">
images of &s;en&s;e will naturally a&s;&s;o|ciate; with the agreeable of the lat|ter, what is agreeable of the former: plea&s;ing a&s;&s;ociations in the mind be|ing no other than images and &s;enti|ments &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to heighten in|ternal perception.</P>
<P>Far-off &s;ounds, or di&s;tant pro|&s;pects, a&s;&s;ociate with, and bring to remembrance, pa&s;t circum&s;tances and actions; becau&s;e the&s;e too are become more &s;ubtile in imagination, and rendered, as it were, remote by time.</P>

<P>The preci&s;e effect of any object to the eye, depends either on its imme|diate oppo&s;ition to other objects, or on the more remote relation it bears to &s;uch as are retained by memory.

<P>The &s;ame power by which the

The plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;ation are again reflected out|wards, and again are perceived by the &s;en&s;es, communicating a new and &s;ocial happine&s;s. It is not till goodne&s;s be thus expre&s;&s;ed, that it a&s;&s;umes the nature of beauty.</P>
<P>All plea&s;ure, whether proceeding from &s;imple or complex cau&s;es, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed as follows: fir&s;t, the plea&s;ure of perceiving the qua|lities of objects by means of &s;en&s;e, <HI>by which</HI> we know that we exi&s;t; &s;econdly, the &s;ocial &s;atisfaction of

<P>Some of our perceptions of plea|&s;ure proceed from powers original and innate; others are derived from experience and cu&s;tom, &s;uch as that which renders things, di&s;agreeable in them&s;elves, plea&s;ing when we are accu&s;tomed to find them a&s;&s;ociated
<PB N="53" REF="51">
with circum&s;tances and objects that are in them&s;elves agreeable. Many are the characters already e&s;tabli&s;hed by nature; and even artificial cha|racters derive a kind of propriety from cu&s;tom, which is rightly term|ed a &s;econd nature. Is it the cha|racter of the eye to be lucid, and of the cheek to be red? a bright eye, and a ro&s;y cheek, are, of their kind, the mo&s;t beautiful; each part being beautiful, either according to the de|gree of gentle expre&s;&s;ion it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in it&s;elf, or as it is habitually a&s;&s;oci|ated with parts that are more gently expre&s;&s;ive.

It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, in order to produce an agreeable effect, that there be a union and &s;ubordination in the means of expre&s;&s;ion, and that none of the le&s;s e&s;&s;ential qualities confound the greater; as it is requi|&s;ite, in order to render any more complicated character or compo&s;i|tion perfect, that there be a chief or principal part, which is mo&s;t &s;triking

or expre&s;&s;ive: the countenance be|ing the mo&s;t remarkable part of the human body; as, in the countenance, the eye is the principal feature. Even one part of the &s;ame body owes its beauty to the affinity it bears to the re&s;t, as the beauty of the whole de|pends on its oppo&s;ition to other bo|dies. The neck of a &s;tatue, were it ever &s;o well &s;haped, would not ap|pear beautiful when &s;eparated from the head and &s;houlders; the &s;eeming &s;oftne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of the bo|&s;om would cea&s;e to plea&s;e, did the head and &s;houlders &s;eem to be equal|ly &s;oft and &s;mooth.

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Of GRACEFULNESS.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;peaking of expre&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between an expre&s;&s;ion of the benevolent kind, and of the ira&s;cible or malignant. Animals of coar&s;er natures are fully as &s;u&s;cep|tible of anger, hatred, revenge, or any of the ho&s;tile pa&s;&s;ions, as men; and the ba&s;e&s;t of the human race are ever mo&s;t &s;ubject to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions: but they know little of pity, love, e&s;teem, or any of the gentler ones. The malignant pa&s;&s;ions di&s;qualify the mind for every plea&s;ing and in|genious &s;en&s;ation. Anger is the
<PB N="58" REF="56">
painful or &s;tupifying pa&s;&s;ion, as love is the delicious and enlivening one. It would therefore be highly impro|per to apply the idea of gracefulne&s;s to one in a fit of rage or jealou&s;y; what plea&s;es mo&s;t in appearance, be|ing evidently an expre&s;&s;ion of plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>He who &s;eeks to know the origin of gracefulne&s;s, mu&s;t look for it in his own mind; whatever is graceful there, mu&s;t be &s;o in expre&s;&s;ion. It is a quality analogous to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s of affection; that &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;m of action which goes hand in hand with beauty; or, if we may be allowed the phra&s;e, it
<PB N="59" REF="57">
is the <HI>&s;oul</HI> of beauty, or the <HI>empha&s;is</HI> of plea&s;ing expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delight|ful moments of thought, the body is naturally thrown into attitudes which have the power of communi|cating a like &s;oftne&s;s to the minds of others; it is on account of this plea&s;ing &s;ympathy, that we be&s;tow on &s;uch actions or expre&s;&s;ions the appellation of <HI>graceful.</HI>&mdash;Much has been &s;aid about an appearance of ea&s;e peculiar to gracefulne&s;s; yet per|haps it will be impo&s;&s;ible to find an example of any very graceful atti|tude that conveys not &s;ome degree of carefulne&s;s or anxiety. The &s;weet,
<PB N="60" REF="58">
reluctant amorous delay, the hopes, fears, and tender &s;olicitudes of love, pre&s;ent us with images of the ut|mo&s;t gracefulne&s;s. Even in circum|&s;tances that have an appearance of di&s;tre&s;s, beauty oft a&s;&s;umes an air of the &s;ublime&s;t grace and dignity. There is indeed a certain elevation of mind, a happy con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperior virtue, requi&s;ite to dignify every pa&s;&s;ion, and is e&s;&s;ential to grace; for there is no grace without dignity. Grace is the &s;ublimity of beauty; the mode&s;t pride of virtue; the gentle dignity of love. An at|titude expre&s;&s;ive of the pen&s;ive and plea&s;ing melancholy, a &s;entiment pe|culiar
<PB N="61" REF="59">
to the fine&s;t &s;ouls, is ever mo&s;t graceful. The lovelie&s;t of the Graces has on her face a ca&s;t of &s;adne&s;s mixt with the &s;weete&s;t joy. Gracefulne&s;s is an expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure; but plea&s;ure is not ea&s;e, it is &s;omething more. In truth, the mind is far from being mo&s;t happy when mo&s;t at ea&s;e; this being at be&s;t a negative kind of happine&s;s: in order to be really &s;o, it mu&s;t be employed in &s;ome pur&s;uit wherein it is deeply concerned, and its affections fondly engaged: be&s;et on all &s;ides with dan|ger and fear, we embrace with rap|ture every occa&s;ion of hope, and become more intere&s;ted and happy
<PB N="62" REF="60">
in the pur&s;uit and accompli&s;hment of our wi&s;hes, as the labour ap|pears more arduous of overtaking them.</P>
<P>Here we mean not to &s;ay, that graceful action may not be frequent|ly found without its peculiar energy in the mind: we only advance, that our prejudices in favour of graceful|ne&s;s are originally founded on this principle; and would thence infer, that any appearance of beauty which is con&s;i&s;tent with perfect indolence or ea&s;e, can &s;ugge&s;t nothing more than a predi&s;po&s;ition to elegance of action, a &s;eeming aptitude in the ex|ternal &s;ymptoms of affection. It is
<PB N="63" REF="61">
not till the pa&s;&s;ions have arrived at maturity, and are &s;weetened by the acce&s;&s;ion of love, that the per&s;on a&s;|&s;umes a true air of delicate graceful|ne&s;s. If one who has no elegance of &s;oul appear graceful, it is by accident, as a fool &s;ometimes looks wi&s;e. In love, the &s;oul is feelingly alive to every finer &s;en&s;e, and it is the fine&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of life which excites it; love per&s;onified being perfect beau|ty.</P>
<P>When we meet with a pa&s;&s;age in any author that expre&s;&s;es a lively &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion, joy, grief, for even the &s;orrow of &s;en&s;ible per|&s;ons is frequently accompanied with
<PB N="64" REF="62">
plea&s;ure, there is always pre&s;ented to us along with it, an image of gracefulne&s;s. It is this delicious en|thu&s;ia&s;m which &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly di|&s;tingui&s;hes the works of <HI>Rapha&euml;l</HI> and <HI>Correggio</HI>; it is this alone which rai&s;es above others the writings of the di|vinc <HI>Sappho.</HI> The great charm of poetry is that <HI>&s;pirit</HI> or <HI>mu&s;e</HI> which in&s;pires every thing with elegance and <HI>animation.</HI> The beautiful and the graceful of &s;entiment, are expre&s;|&s;ions of the highe&s;t degree of <HI>life</HI> or <HI>human feeling.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Venus of Medicis</HI> is generally given as an example of female beau|ty, and indeed is probably the mo&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="63">
graceful and perfect of all human productions; but this &s;tatue is highly imitative of mode&s;ty, that exqui&s;ite grace and ornament of every amiable virtue. Were an arti&s;t to attempt a painting of the like kind, how might he &s;till heighten every grace by dif|fu&s;ing a &s;weet blu&s;h over the coun|tenance of his figure; a circum&s;tance in which the marble is nece&s;&s;arily defective? And this is, no doubt, what is meant by that fine allegory of Venus attired by the Graces, that every thing which is graceful in out|ward appearance, is only as it were the trappings and ornaments of that heavenly love of the &s;oul, by the an|cients
<PB N="66" REF="64">
a&s;cribed to the <HI>Venus Urania,</HI> or cele&s;tial; in oppo&s;ition to what is attributed to the other <HI>Venus,</HI> wor|&s;hipped by them as the earthly and vulgar.</P>
<P>THUS have we briefly traced the progre&s;s of beauty from its begin|ning in the <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> to its &s;econd &s;ource of perfection in the <HI>mind,</HI> both centring in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>life</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ibility:</HI> and as we have before ob&s;erved, that whatever cau|&s;es &s;ugge&s;t the &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to the qualities we perceive in our&s;elves, are the actual and principal plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es; &s;o it is &s;till more wor|thy
<PB N="67" REF="65">
our notice, that nothing gives us &s;o much &s;atisfaction, as to con|template the &s;ymptoms of plea|&s;ure or happine&s;s in tho&s;e who&s;e merit and beauty entitle them to a &s;hare either in our love or e&s;tima|tion.</P>
<P>It is at this &s;econd period plea&s;ure lo&s;es the name of &s;en&s;ual or &s;elfi&s;h. He who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this more exten&s;ive animation, is con&s;equently intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of his fellow-crea|tures, as al&s;o in the &s;tudy of every thing that is related to this finer ani|mation; and, as he perceives beauty in the&s;e things, he will intere&s;t him|&s;elf in their perfection, looking on

them as in &s;ome mea&s;ure related to him&s;elf, and as portions of that univer&s;al and &s;ocial whole, of which he con&s;iders him&s;elf al&s;o as a part.</P>
<P>Hence we may conclude, that the reli&s;h mankind have for true beauty, is in proportion to the clearne&s;s of their moral perceptions; or, in other words, to their love of goodne&s;s: that even inanimate beauty is chiefly a &s;econdary idea, or a&s;&s;ociation, ari|&s;ing from the external &s;ymptoms of natural affection, which is the beau|ty of the human &s;oul: and that not only whatever tends to deprive us of life, but whatever ob&s;tructs the

It is a mere abu&s;e of words to call that <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> which includes the happine&s;s of others;
<PB N="74" REF="70">
&s;ince, in the &s;trict idea of a &s;elf, there is but one included.</P>
<P>True happine&s;s flows from the fir&s;t-mentioned principle, and is the enjoyment of plea&s;ure by reflection, the plea&s;ure of plea&s;ing tho&s;e we love, or the &s;till more exten&s;ive plea&s;ure of contributing to the happine&s;s of all mankind. The fir&s;t and &s;econd of tho&s;e motives are indeed a&s;&s;i&s;ting to each other; for what can be more plea&s;ing than &s;elf-applau&s;e when con|firmed by the approbation of the good? But tho&s;e who are actuated merely by the love of fame, are far more numerous than tho&s;e who fir&s;t con&s;ult the approbation of their own hearts, and who e&s;teem the applau&s;e of the many, not altogether for its own &s;ake, but as it accords with the voice of rea&s;on; while he who&s;e feel|ings teach him to di&s;tingui&s;h between
<PB N="75" REF="71">
the good and the evil of moral ac|tion, will al&s;o have a choice in the rectitude of external applau&s;e, always preferring the commendation of the few who be&s;tow it on real merit, to the voice of the vulgar, which is de|termined by caprice or by acci|dent.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to &s;uch as place their ultimate contentment in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality, who&s;e &s;ym|pathy is &s;o narrowly confined, that they enjoy no plea&s;ure from partici|pation? or to tho&s;e that are &s;o far de|praved, as to be deterred from actions hurtful to them&s;elves and to their fellow-creatures, by no other than the ba&s;e&s;t of all motives, the dread of puni&s;hment? Were it po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade mankind, what is their chief intere&s;t here to know, that to a&s;&s;i&s;t the good endeavours, and to &s;ympa|thize
<PB N="76" REF="72">
with the weakne&s;&s;es and nece&s;|&s;ities of each other, yields an enjoy|ment far &s;uperior to any that is of a mere &s;elfi&s;h nature, there would be little occa&s;ion, in a moral view, to threaten the infliction either of tem|poral or eternal puni&s;hment. In|deed it &s;eems almo&s;t &s;ufficiently ju&s;t, if there be any totally de&s;titute of humanity, that &s;uch, from their dul|ne&s;s, are deprived of the mo&s;t ele|gant and exalted felicity.</P>
<P>Self-&s;atisfaction, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, is an object of pur&s;uit in all; but ambition and avarice embrace the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance, the means of good for good it&s;elf. The vainly-ambitious place their chief happine&s;s in fame, ignorant of what &s;hould go before; the avaricious in fortune, equally blind to the ble&s;&s;ings that &s;hould follow. To employ every
<PB N="77" REF="73">
gentle method, therefore, of extend|ing this principle of human &s;ympa|thy; to improve our mo&s;t delicate feelings, and give to the &s;oul a more tender touch of all that is endearing to humanity, by exerci&s;ing it in the &s;peculation and practice of ingeni|ous virtue, is the great purpo&s;e of moral precept and of &s;ound philo&s;o|phy.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of SENSIBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE good qualities of the head and of the heart are rarely found together; their union compo&s;es a mind truly noble. The folly of ill-directed goodne&s;s too nearly re&s;embles vice; the wi&s;|dom
<PB N="80" REF="76">
of the unfeeling is wor&s;e than folly.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle which prompts a man to &s;eek happine&s;s, or to relieve him&s;elf in di&s;tre&s;s, di&s;po&s;es him to make others happy, or to alleviate their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility any man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, his affections are the more &s;elfi&s;h; the more he is &s;en&s;ible of happine&s;s him&s;elf, he is the more di&s;po&s;ed to make others happy.</P>
<P>THAT peevi&s;h weakne&s;s and &s;ore|ne&s;s of nerve, which is apt to be alarmed at trifles, and to be di&s;plea|&s;ed without &s;ufficient cau&s;e, is to be cla&s;&s;ed with other di&s;tempers; it is
<PB N="81" REF="77">
fal&s;e or di&s;ea&s;ed feeling. Some are rather irritable than &s;en&s;ible; their coar&s;er natures are capable only of the malevolent and gro&s;&s;er pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>A PREDISPOSITION to the coar&s;er pa&s;&s;ions can never proceed from de|licacy of &s;entiment, but argues a con|dition the very rever&s;e: true &s;en&s;ibi|lity is ever inclined to overlook er|rors, and to forgive injuries; altho', on &s;ome occa&s;ions, rea&s;on teaches it to act with becoming dignity and &s;pirit. Mens enjoyments or mi&s;|fortunes are to be computed from their different degrees of feeling. What can they mean who &s;peak of
<PB N="82" REF="78">
the happine&s;s of the in&s;en&s;ible? Can there be a greater ab&s;urdity, than to envy the enjoyments of &s;uch as want the power to enjoy?</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. TASTE and GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>AN original delicacy of ta&s;te is al&s;o the in&s;eparable effect and &s;ymptom of the true &s;en&s;ibility; which includes not only a &s;en&s;e of love, pity, gratitude, or common du|ty, for of tho&s;e even the rude&s;t na|tures are &s;eldom altogether de&s;titute; but it is a certain elegance of &s;oul,
<PB N="83" REF="79">
which renders kindne&s;s mo&s;t kind, and plea&s;ure mo&s;t plea&s;ing; it is genius and ta&s;te, the tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip, the politene&s;s of e&s;teem, and the exqui&s;ite and refined endear|ments of love!</P>
<P>TASTE is the younger &s;i&s;ter of Virtue; the offspring of Ta&s;te is Plea&s;ure, that of Virtue is Happi|ne&s;s: it is the grace of &s;entiment: that which plea&s;es &s;uch as are &s;u&s;|ceptible of the highe&s;t plea&s;ure; a &s;ubordinate, yet more amiable qua|lity, which depends on the nicer di&s;cernments of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>ON the clearne&s;s of moral percep|tion, or &s;entimental light, depends
<PB N="84" REF="80">
the power of choo&s;ing the good and refu&s;ing the evil. Whatever is pro|perly &s;aid to improve the mind, in|crea&s;es this faculty of accepting and refu&s;ing, by rendering the characters of good and evil more per&s;picuous and di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>ALL ignorance of beauty, or de|pravity of ta&s;te, is defective anima|tion; all improvement and perfec|tion of the&s;e, is increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility; the powers of the mind, as well as of the body, being rendered more per|fect by a proper exerci&s;e of them. To que&s;tion whether an improved ta&s;te be an advantage, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to doubt whether it is bet|ter
<PB N="85" REF="81">
to be or not to be, to live or not to live. One devoid of ta&s;te, is dead to all the finer feelings.</P>
<P>THERE is acquired as well as na|tural dulne&s;s; bad ta&s;te, or evil pre|judice, is &s;tupidity acquired. To feel, is to be alive; every thing that heightens &s;entiment or perception, therefore, increa&s;es animation.</P>
<P>GENIUS is the power or capacity of clearly conceiving, and properly combining, images and &s;entiments, either as they relate to what is com|monly called utility, or to ta&s;te; it is the highe&s;t effect of &s;en&s;ibility and rea&s;on, the power of a&s;&s;ociating ideas harmoniou&s;ly.&mdash;Poetry, painting,
<PB N="86" REF="82">
and mu&s;ic, are &s;ciences peculiarly be|holden to genius: poetry is the lan|guage of elevated and refined pa&s;|&s;ion; painting is &s;ilent poetry; mu|&s;ic is the accent of pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>GENIUS is al&s;o u&s;ed to denote a particular turn for any &s;tudy or em|ployment; but one may have a turn for a &s;tudy that requires, properly &s;peaking, little or no genius.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. POETRY, PAINTING; and MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>A GOOD poem is an effect of the highe&s;t effort of human ima|gination and judgment.</P>
<P>MERE imitation is beneath the dignity of poetry, painting, and mu|&s;ic. An arti&s;t &s;hould repre&s;ent ob|jects not always as they are; but as they tend to &s;oothe &s;ome plea&s;ing di&s;|po&s;ition of the &s;oul, or as they are heightened in imagination when it is predi&s;po&s;ed to &s;entiment and to pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To be in&s;en&s;ible of the mu&s;ical powers, is to be &s;o far ignorant of the
<PB N="88" REF="84">
language of the finer pa&s;&s;ions; but it is evident, one who never felt the refinements of pity, or of love, can|not conceive how mu&s;ic &s;hould ex|pre&s;s them, or di&s;po&s;e to &s;uch gentle emotions.</P>
<P>MUSIC is the means of &s;oothing and exciting the virtuous di&s;po&s;i|tions of the &s;oul: &s;o far as it an&s;wers this end, it is to be e&s;teemed; other|wi&s;e it is fit only to tickle the ears of &s;uch as have no hearts, who&s;e pre|&s;umption is ever proportioned to their ignorance and want of feel|ing.</P>
<P>IN all things the plea&s;ing of &s;en&s;e a&s;&s;ociates with the plea&s;ing of &s;enti|ment,
<PB N="89" REF="85">
and di&s;po&s;es the mind to hap|pine&s;s and benevolence.</P>

<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. LOVE and FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>AS two different notes founded at the &s;ame time beget harmo|ny, a quality which belongs to nei|ther of them apart; &s;o de&s;ire and e&s;teem, mutually improving each other, generate love; a pa&s;&s;ion diffe|rent from either, yet &s;uperior to both.</P>
<P>LOVE, in ab&s;ence of rea&s;on, and hatred, have almo&s;t the &s;ame ends
<PB N="90" REF="86">
and wi&s;hes. Tho&s;e only are capable of true friend&s;hip, who know what is kind and agreeable on every occa|&s;ion to do or to &s;ay, and are &s;en&s;ibly plea&s;ed with what is well &s;aid and done. A fool can never enjoy the plea&s;ures of love: he may indeed ta&s;te &s;omething of the mere animal part; but not the infinite endearments that heighten and protract plea&s;ure, nor that &s;weet mixture of love and e&s;teem which increa&s;es with enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>THEY are mi&s;taken who &s;uppo&s;e, that the mo&s;t firm friend&s;hips &s;ub&s;i&s;t between per&s;ons of exactly &s;imilar qualities and di&s;po&s;itions: &s;uch &s;i|milarity
<PB N="91" REF="87">
is more likely to produce rival&s;hip than friend&s;hip. There &s;hould rather be on the one &s;ide a little more judgment, and on the other a little more &s;en&s;ibility; and the parties &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of each other's perfections: this ob&s;er|vation holds peculiarly re&s;pecting the &s;exes.</P>
<P>A DELICACY of per&s;on and of mind, approaching to weakne&s;s, is becoming in a female; le&s;s &s;oftne&s;s, and more &s;trength, are expected in the male: they ought to make up a complete character together, rather than two alike perfect and di&s;tinct ones; the di&s;po&s;itions of one &s;ex be|ing
<PB N="92" REF="88">
qualified by the peculiar perfec|tions of the other. Nature, by di|&s;tingui&s;hing the characters of the &s;exes, has removed all rival&s;hip be|tween them, which otherwi&s;e might have been a hindrance to the union of love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>WHATEVER peculiar difference marks the delicacy of the female character, renders the per&s;on of a woman mo&s;t lovely, and this pro|priety holds al&s;o re&s;pecting her mind; it is that tenderne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, deli|cacy of ta&s;te, and retired mode&s;ty, naturally peculiar to the &s;ex, which renders her mo&s;t amiable in the e&s;teem of a man of feeling.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="89">THE tenderne&s;s of love and friend|&s;hip affects a narrow circle; the more inten&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, it is the more liable to be confined. However, univer&s;al love and particular friend|&s;hip are noways incon&s;i&s;tent; diffe|rent degrees of e&s;teem are &s;uitable to different degrees of merit, and friend&s;hip is contracted and con|firmed by habit and clo&s;e acquaint|ance: one may be a well-wi&s;her to all, but can have a friend&s;hip only for a few; a perfect love but for one.</P>
<P>AN extended principle of benevo|lence comprehends, a friend, a fa|mily, country, and all the world;
<PB N="94" REF="90">
and, according to the extent of this principle, our capacity for happine&s;s is extended.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. COURAGE and HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h manly courage from bea&s;tly feroci|ty; it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that cou|rage can exi&s;t where there is no ap|prehen&s;ion of danger: the mind that is capable of honour, cannot be in|&s;en&s;ible to fear; the former over|coming the latter, in a noble cau&s;e, is true bravery.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="91">RANCOUR and revenge are too frequently taken for &s;ymptoms of a nice &s;en&s;e of honour, than which no qualities can be more oppo&s;ite to a refined &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>HONOUR relates to tho&s;e parts of human conduct not particularly taken notice of by the laws. It teaches a man to pre&s;erve inviolate the &s;ecrets, and to &s;upport the inte|re&s;t and reputation, of a friend; to be &s;trictly ju&s;t, where no public law obliges him to ju&s;tice; to fulfill all equitable engagements; to hold mo&s;t &s;acred all hone&s;t tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. It is a con&s;cious dignity of &s;pirit, which teaches to commit no|thing
<PB N="96" REF="92">
that is mean or di&s;graceful; but which excites to generous and noble actions, proceeding from a pe|culiar delicacy of &s;entiment, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and tempered by the fortitude of rea&s;on.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI. CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL right rules of conduct are drawn from the natural affec|tions, and from experience. The &s;ame affection which teaches us to love our fellow-creatures, reproaches us when we neglect or behave ill to
<PB N="97" REF="93">
them; and this la&s;t operation of af|fection is called remor&s;e, or check of con&s;cience: but by habit or educa|tion, an artificial con&s;cience may be created, which may either &s;erve to &s;trengthen or to &s;ubvert the con|&s;cience of nature:&mdash;</P>
<P>THUS, a &s;tronger remor&s;e will fol|low a crime committed again&s;t na|tural affection, when confirmed by civil policy and habit, than could follow from either of the&s;e motives alone.</P>
<P>NATURE has e&s;tabli&s;hed a com|mon and in&s;tinctive attachment between parent and child, as al&s;o among other relations; but the
<PB N="98" REF="94">
&s;tronge&s;t of all affections is that which is conceived by tho&s;e who love and e&s;teem each other on ac|count of their &s;uperior endow|ments.</P>
<P>A MAN may love his children from the &s;ame principle that any animal loves its young; but if he al&s;o perceives that they are virtuous, there re&s;ults from &s;uch a conjunc|tion a benevolence not to be expre&s;|&s;ed. This is natural affection, as highly confirmed and approved by rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THAT an innate &s;en&s;ibility leads to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of good and evil, is certain; but it is al&s;o certain, that
<PB N="99" REF="95">
this natural &s;en&s;e may be improved by rea&s;on, or perverted by prejudice; and that laws of con&s;cience are frequently derived from cu&s;tom, which rivets the chains of error. To overcome evil opinions, there|fore, the mind mu&s;t get the better of all prejudices or perver&s;ions of con&s;cience, and e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of right on the &s;olid foun|dation of ju&s;t &s;entiment and rea|&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. SINCERITY.</HEAD>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e an end of pa&s;|&s;ion, there mu&s;t be an end of all moral rea&s;oning. Pa&s;&s;ion alone can correct pa&s;&s;ion. Thus we forego a pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, in hopes that we

<P>SOME, in order to pay a fal&s;e com|pliment to &s;entimental plea&s;ures, at|tempt altogether to depreciate the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e: with as little ju|&s;tice, though with like plau&s;ibility, have men endeavoured to decry the natural pa&s;&s;ions and affections, as in|con&s;i&s;tent with human felicity.

<P>HE who commits an action which deba&s;es him in his own mind, be|&s;ides its other evil con&s;equences, lays up a &s;tore of future mi&s;ery, which will haunt him as long as the me|mory of the deed remains.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. TEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE great rule of &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures is, to u&s;e them &s;o as they may not de&s;troy them&s;elves, or be divorced from the plea&s;ures of &s;enti|ment;

<P>MEN ever confine the meaning of the word plea&s;ure to what plea&s;es them&s;elves: gluttons imagine, that by plea&s;ure is meant gluttony. The only true epicures are &s;uch as enjoy the plea&s;ures of temperance. Small plea&s;ures &s;eem great to &s;uch as know no greater. The virtuous man is he who has &s;en&s;e enough to enjoy the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>SUPERFLUITY and parade among the vulgar-rich, pa&s;s for elegance and greatne&s;s. To the man of true ta&s;te,

<P>WHATEVER plea&s;ures are imme|diately derived from the &s;en&s;es, per|&s;ons of fine internal feeling enjoy be&s;ides their other plea&s;ures; while &s;uch as place their chief happine&s;s in the former, can have no true ta&s;te for the delicious &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul.</P>

<P>POWER is no good quality by it&s;elf; it is the power of doing good, alone, that is de&s;irable to the wi&s;e. All vice is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and the meane&s;t is that which is mo&s;t con|tractedly &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="107">GREAT minds can reconcile &s;ub|limity to good-humour; in weak ones, it is generally coupled with &s;e|verity and moro&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>SUBLIME qualities men admire; they love the gentler virtues. When Wi&s;dom would engage a heart, &s;he wooes it in a &s;mile. What the au|&s;tere man advi&s;es with his tongue, his frown forbids.</P>

<P>NO man has a natural right to hold a greater &s;hare of power than another, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a higher

<P>IT is not &s;o proper to &s;ay, that vir|tue leads to happine&s;s, as to af|firm, that whatever leads to real hap|pine&s;s is virtue. The rea&s;on why certain actions are forbidden by law, is, that &s;uch actions are found by experience to be attended with evil effects.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="110">BUT, becau&s;e very few indeed are them&s;elves capable of taking &s;uch an extended view of things as to enable them to judge of all the good or evil con&s;equences of actions, laws are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the direction of the weak, and to re&s;train the vicious from committing actions that, in their effects, are evil.</P>
<P>THE fear of legal puni&s;hment pre|&s;ents the only hold that can be taken of tho&s;e who have no feeling for others; by which they are taught, at lea&s;t, to feel for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NO action is evil altogether be|cau&s;e it is contrary to law; but cer|tain actions are ju&s;tly forbidden by
<PB N="115" REF="111">
law, becau&s;e their effects are experi|enced to be evil.</P>
<P>LET us be careful to &s;eparate the idea of ju&s;tice from that of revenge, which, like other malevolent pa&s;|&s;ions, is to be re&s;trained by rea&s;on: the great end of human ju&s;tice, is public or private &s;ecurity; but for|bearance and mercy often reclaim, when violence and &s;everity would be attended with evil con&s;equences: for this cau&s;e, it is &s;ometimes pro|per to return good for evil, and to mitigate the rigour of laws with mercy.</P>
<P>WHATEVER &s;everity ju&s;tice may be obliged to inflict, it is &s;till with a
<PB N="116" REF="112">
view to greater kindne&s;s. To re&s;tore the criminal him&s;elf to a &s;en&s;e of his duty, to &s;et an example to others, or to rid &s;ociety of a de&s;perate mem|ber, are the three rational ends for which puni&s;hment or death is in|flicted: otherwi&s;e retribution of evil is malevolence or blind revenge, and not ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THERE are certain exceptions to general laws, wherein ju&s;tice a&s;&s;umes the name of mercy: he who, in his conduct, ob&s;erves the&s;e exceptions, is ju&s;tly merciful.</P>
<P>IT is owing to the imperfection of human laws, which cannot pro|vide again&s;t all accidental circum|&s;tances
<PB N="117" REF="113">
and exceptions, that an idea of mercy is oppo&s;ed to that of ju|&s;tice: the&s;e virtues, however, are not really repugnant; where mercy is proper, it were unju&s;t not to be merciful.</P>
<P>THERE is hardly any &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion among the virtuous as hatred: the vicious hate the enemies of vice; the good pity the enemies of virtue. A generous mind wi&s;hes not to find men faultle&s;s, but is happy in find|ing occa&s;ions of forgiving their er|rors.</P>
<P>THE violent and ho&s;tile pa&s;&s;ions are never employed by the wi&s;e, but
<PB N="118" REF="114">
for the greater purpo&s;es of benevo|lence.</P>
<P>TO withhold our power, when we can prevent the ruin of a fellow|creature, even again&s;t his will, is to be guilty of his de&s;truction. Where is the difference in effect, whether evils are brought on us by our follies, or by fate? Is a man the le&s;s to be pitied who falls, for that his weakne&s;s was the cau&s;e of his falling?</P>
<P>WHO, if he &s;aw a child approach|ing the brink of a precipice, would withhold his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, on a pretence that the child was left to the freedom of its own will? Men are like chil|dren,
<PB N="119" REF="115">
that &s;ometimes mu&s;t be re|&s;trained from the ways of error.</P>
