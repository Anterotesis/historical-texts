A female Polemic of the la&s;t
Century.</HEAD>
<P>IN the hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Million, the cha|racter
of Emily had opportunities of
unfolding it&s;elf not hitherto pre&s;ented.
Rarely had &s;he quitted the &s;ide of a blind
parent to enter into a contracted circle;
and if this circum&s;tance had been detri|mental
to her &s;agacity in human nature,
it proved not unfavourable to the high
culture of her elegant accompli&s;hments.
In the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;olitude fine talents
<PB N="2" REF="5">
are pur&s;ued with an inten&s;ity not expe|rienced
by tho&s;e who&s;e active circle, di|ver&s;ified
by the fe&s;tivities of di&s;&s;ipation,
or the bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s, can only enable
them to become lovers of art, and not
arti&s;ts. Solitude, which &s;o frequently
excites the querulou&s;ne&s;s of genius, is a
&s;evere mother who forms a lovely pro|geny;
what in the great world had only
been a momentary amu&s;ement, there be|comes
a permanent occupation. Sweet
is the uninterrupted indu&s;try of genius,
magical it's contracted day, and delicious
that inebriation of ta&s;te which becomes
an ab&s;orbing pa&s;&s;ion. In &s;olitude alone
can now be acquired that difficult faci|lity,
which, though it performs its mira|cles
of art in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, has been the
&s;low and painful acqui&s;ition of great prac|tice
and greater meditation. Emily ro&s;e
with the fun; her prayer was a &s;ilent ori|&s;on
of aweful plea&s;ure; her crayon was in
<PB N="3" REF="6">
her hand during her morning walks, and if
&s;he brought home &s;ome romantic figure,
&s;ome tenderer tint, from the a&s;pect of
nature, it was a new enjoyment. The
clock told the hour of midnight, when,
with regret, &s;he relinqui&s;hed her volume,
and di&s;&s;olved the enchantment of her
fancy. Often, as &s;he &s;at by her father,
her bu&s;y &s;pirits were &s;o diffu&s;ed in her
little employments, that Bal&s;our could
only hear her gentle&s;t &s;u&s;pirations; and
would &s;ay afterwards, I could almo&s;t <HI>&s;ee</HI>
you Emily very bu&s;y.</P>
<P>Emily, when &s;he now compared her
talents with tho&s;e of the favourites of fa|&s;hion,
including &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional arti&s;ts,
felt a new confidence in her powers: but
&s;he was &s;ilent, as well as mode&s;t; for &s;he
found that &s;he was inferior to all, if that
inferiority is to be allowed becau&s;e &s;he
was inexpert in the dull and formal rou|tine
of life. A per&s;on of true genius is
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&s;oon placed beneath the level of equality
among the frivolous, becau&s;e talents give
no real &s;uperiority among &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates;
they are applauded rapidly from an old
cu&s;tom; but having been applauded with|out
feeling, are as rapidly forgotten. The
permanent intere&s;ts of &s;uch a &s;ociety, con|&s;i&s;t
in every thing that is the rever&s;e of
genius; &s;o that a certain mark of medi|ocrity
of talent, is the plea&s;ure which
&s;uch a circle affords. To Emily their
conver&s;ation was a language, of which the
rudiments were unknown; their amu&s;e|ments
pa&s;&s;ed away, too numerous and
too rapid to leave any delight; and their
mo&s;t important concerns &s;eemed the bur|le&s;que
of human life, while what occa|&s;ioned
the mo&s;t voluble lamentations, ex|cited
her interior &s;mile. Her beauty was
likely to occa&s;ion &s;ome trouble from the
men; but her extreme docility, and unpre|&s;uming
manners, rendered her at fir&s;t &s;up|portable
<PB N="5" REF="8">
to the women. She conciliated
their favour by her willingne&s;s to be con|&s;idered
as an inoffen&s;ive cypher, which of
it&s;elf was of no value, unle&s;s placed by
tho&s;e who made a figure in the pre&s;ent
circle.</P>
<P>It is but performing an act of ju&s;tice
to Mi&s;s Million to declare, that &s;he was
infinitely delighted by the varied powers
of her new companion; &s;he told all the
world &s;o; and evinced as much plea&s;ure
in exhibiting the performances of Emily,
as if they had been her own. Emily could
not but feel a warm gratitude for &s;uch
ince&s;&s;ant partiality; but it often co&s;t her
the pang of a deep blu&s;h, and the di&s;gu&s;t
of an amplification, of which her&s;elf was
at once the divinity wor&s;hipped and the
victim immolated. There was &s;uch a
roughne&s;s in the gentlene&s;s of Mi&s;s Mil|lion;
of her incen&s;e &s;he was prodigal;
but in her zeal, &s;he ever threw cen&s;er
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and incen&s;e together in the face of her di|vinity.
In vain Emily entreated the favour
of being placed in the &s;hade, Mi&s;s Million
felt too much not to exhale her admira|tion
in panegyrics. This amiable lady,
it mu&s;t be acknowledged, lo&s;t nothing by
this exce&s;s of kindne&s;s; the higher the
prai&s;e &s;he be&s;towed on Emily, the &s;tronger
it's dazzling reflection fell on her own
cheri&s;hed per&s;on. Was it not evident,
that the more &s;he talked of "the old
blind lieutenant's daughter," her be|nevolence
was amply di&s;played? The
more &s;he was enraptured by the brilliant
finger of Emily on her harp, it was clear
the nerves of her intendered &s;oul caught
the melodious vibrations; and no one
could &s;ay, when &s;he overflowed in rap|tures
concerning light and &s;hade, as &s;he
pointed to her paintings, but that Mi&s;s
Million mu&s;t have a very &s;en&s;ible ta&s;te
for the magic of her canvas. Emily,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
however, received the approbation and
e&s;teem of Lady Belfield, who&s;e favour
&s;he felt an ambition to enjoy; for Lady
Belfield was her&s;elf a woman of talents,
and might have been a woman of genius,
and therefore knew the real value of her
varied and felicitous accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Million's circle was by no means
confined; &s;he was proud of the acquaint|ance
of every per&s;on of fa&s;hion; and be|&s;ides
her pa&s;&s;ion for ma&s;querades and bo|tany,
&s;he was a di&s;tingui&s;hed patrone&s;s of
literary merit; her name was enrolled
among the earlie&s;t &s;ub&s;criptions; &s;he had
received the honour of a dedication of a
novel, which was decorated not only by
her name, but by the &s;plendour of her
engraved arms; and be&s;ides the&s;e literary
di&s;tinctions, it was rumoured, that &s;he
her&s;elf had written one &s;onnet, yet pre|&s;erved
in the virgin mode&s;ty of a manu|&s;cript.
She was indeed declared to be
<PB N="8" REF="11">
a prodigy of genius by &s;everal of her
friends, but particularly by three or four
great critics (one of whom it was univer|&s;ally
whi&s;pered wrote in one Review, if
not in all of them) and who did her the
honour of dining with her regularly three
days in the week.</P>
<P>An important per&s;on in the hou&s;e of
Million, was Mrs. Bully the hou&s;e|keeper.
She was a colo&s;&s;us of vulgarity,
a daemon of religion, and a dragon of
virtue. On one occa&s;ion "her &s;tars" had
doomed her to make a &s;light &s;lip; but
religion had now &s;o completely varni&s;hed
over this ancient piece of Engli&s;h china,
that it was a &s;ecret flaw, rather than a vi|&s;ible
crack. Nature had been kind to
her fellow-creatures, in exhibiting her
character in her appearance, but its glar|ing
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s was frequently &s;ubdued by
her ingenuity. Philo&s;ophy exults in
teaching men to conceal or ameliorate
<PB N="9" REF="12">
their defects, and &s;hrewd vulgarity is not
inferior to philo&s;ophy. The tones of a
voice, gro&s;s as the furred porch from which
they i&s;&s;ued, &s;he could render not di&s;plea&s;ing
to &s;ome by adulation; arms, that might
have wielded the &s;pear of Goliah, were
rendered not repul&s;ive by officiousne&s;s;
and the heavy circumference of her body,
could on occa&s;ion roll with celerity to
the &s;ervice of her patrons. She was in|deed
a man&s;ion-hou&s;e of mortality; and
to look on her was to admire the &s;olidity
of tho&s;e materials, which Nature can form
when &s;he &s;imply works with mere fle&s;h
and blood. Nature, indeed, had com|mitted
no error in the formation of Mrs.
Bully; every <HI>part</HI> was uniformly gro&s;s;
but Nature's blunder con&s;i&s;ted in the
<HI>whole.</HI> A being &s;o nervous and athletic,
&s;hould never have been a woman.</P>
<P>Nor was her mind of an inferior &s;ize to
her body. Since her &s;lippery adventure,
<PB N="10" REF="13">
above hinted, &s;he had held a mo&s;t pious
ab&s;tinence from human fle&s;h; her con&s;ti|tutional
ideas, however, occa&s;ionally flamed
in her expre&s;&s;ions, but were &s;mothered in
her actions; of the latter &s;he was fa&s;tidi|ou&s;ly
nice, &s;o as to be enabled to di&s;cover,
in tho&s;e of other people, a hundred little
peccancies again&s;t cha&s;tity, which e&s;caped
their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; for it is ob&s;ervable,
that per&s;ons who are them&s;elves not of
the cleane&s;t part of the human &s;pecies,
are wonderfully alert in di&s;cerning the
&s;lighte&s;t atoms of dirt on a very clean
per&s;on. Her mind was as active as it was
robu&s;t; and her &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, not hav|ing
any more an opportunity of venting
them&s;elves in the mollifications of love,
made mo&s;t terrible explo&s;ions in ob&s;olete
theology and politics. She read few
books publi&s;hed within this century. The
period of her re&s;earches was tho&s;e days of
fanatical controver&s;y, which &s;o long di&s;|graced
<PB N="11" REF="14">
unenlightened England, when,
neither &s;tationary in her religion or her
politics, every feveri&s;h reformer promul|gated
a &s;y&s;tem of his own. The national
genius, therefore, had no &s;y&s;tem at all,
and branched out into reciprocal per&s;e|cutions.
What then was occa&s;ioned by
the energy of religion and politics, may,
perhaps, be renewed in this age, on an
inver&s;e ratio, becau&s;e we have no religion
and no politics.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bully had, therefore, high-church
arbitrary notions, and jacobite <HI>jure divino</HI>
principles. Some of her favourite au|thors
were Prynne, and Sir Roger L'E&s;|trange.
Filmer, on the divine right of
kings, gave her political creed; &s;he &s;tu|died
the orthodoxy of that holy buffoon,
South; and was recreated by the merry
je&s;ts of Timothy and Philalethes. The
wickedne&s;s of the age &s;he derived from
Sociniani&s;m; it's &s;pirit of &s;edition from
<PB N="12" REF="15">
the u&s;urpation of the Calvini&s;tic William;
and every lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h, and their
allies, &s;he attributed to a judgment of
heaven, for that cool and tolerant &s;pirit
of religion, which, much to her &s;orrow,
&s;he now &s;aw prevailing in the kitchen
as well as in the drawing-room.</P>
<P>When Emily made her appearance in
this family, &s;he gave ri&s;e to numerous
&s;peculations among the dome&s;tics. As
they could not po&s;&s;ibly conceive how
Mi&s;s Million could want a companion,
who lived in one continued &s;eries of
company, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed, that the life of
Emily was as precious to Mr. Million
as that of his over-gorged Bob. Mrs.
Betty, the confidential maid of Mi&s;s Mil|lion,
being the mere looking-gla&s;s of her
mi&s;tre&s;s, reflected her panegyrics. But
Mrs. Bully, their pre&s;ident in high coun|cil,
ob&s;erving that Emily went rarely to
church, po&s;ed Mrs. Betty, and alarmed
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;ome in the council, by enquiring which
was her religion? This que&s;tion, per|haps,
is one of the mo&s;t difficult enquiries
that can be made in the pre&s;ent day.
Mrs. Bully had formed dreadful &s;u&s;pi|cions
of Emily's orthodoxy, becau&s;e of
her irregular church attendance; and yet
to di&s;like a church, does not indicate any
irreverence for religion; for &s;ince the
church is per&s;onated by the par&s;on, we
conceive it is no impiety to for&s;ake any
hou&s;e of God, when we find that the
fa&s;hionable clerical &s;eems more inclined
to pay his re&s;pects to his pari&s;hioners
than his reverence to his God.</P>
<P>She one day bounced into her apart|ment,
and &s;eating her&s;elf, began her in|qui&s;itorial
examination. She opened by
an high eulogium of reading, which &s;he
compared to cookery. "I love (&s;aid &s;he)
the old firloin, and plain round of beef,
where 'tis cut and come again; none of
<PB N="14" REF="17">
your flimflams and French di&s;hes. Your
modern books are like enough proper for
their authors' wits, being very &s;mall and
thin. I like your books big as Bibles; ay,
and the Bible is the be&s;t book. Novels are
the reading of your fine ladies; but if we
like love-&s;tories, there's a mort of um in
the Bible."</P>
<P>"I think, Mrs. Bully, (replied Emily)
mo&s;t of them had better have been
omitted."</P>
<P>"The Lord pre&s;erve your &s;oul! not
a tittle mu&s;t be done away. Every word
there is God's word. Read St. Au&s;tin's
City of God; and the church has de|cided.
Let me tell you, Mi&s;s, that the
church of England is without &s;pot or
wrinkle; mark that! and cur&s;ed are all
di&s;&s;enters."</P>
<P>"I am no di&s;&s;enter, Mrs. Bully; but
the&s;e are matters for different heads than
mine."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
"What is your eternal &s;alvation to be
obtained by others, as the cur&s;ed papi&s;ts
&s;ay? Mayharp, Mi&s;s, you don't believe
in the Athana&s;ian creed?"</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand it."</P>
<P>"That's an old vile excu&s;e for not
believing. Now a &s;yllable can be done
away. Does'n't it tell you, that you
mu&s;t be damned if you don't believe in
it? Take my word for it, that Saint
Athana&s;ius knew more about his own
creed than that fiend Arius. And what
think you of Con&s;tantine the Great?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Some &s;ay he was a felon."</P>
<P>"I tell you, Mi&s;s, he was a &s;aint,
Don't you know, Mi&s;s, the di&s;tinctions
and the differences between Trinunities,
Coe&s;&s;entialities, Modalities, eternal Ge|nerations,
eternal Proce&s;&s;ions, Incarna|tions,
and Hypo&s;tatical Unions?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What is all this, Mrs. Bully? Are
&s;uch terms, points of faith? They &s;eem
fitter for a Conjurer than a Chri&s;tian."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">
"Oh! that I had lived in tho&s;e bli&s;s|ful
days of controver&s;y, where the con|cerns
of a whole city con&s;i&s;ted in di&s;putes
about the Con&s;ub&s;tantiality; when, in
quitting the &s;hop of a trader, one not
only got by one's divinity a great bar|gain,
but al&s;o the man to change his re|ligion;
when the dear boys in the &s;treet
would fight one another for Arius and
Athana&s;ius! To be &s;ure Arius had the
be&s;t of it while he lived; and Con&s;tantine
wrote to them, that they were both fools
for di&s;puting about what no one could
under&s;tand: but didn't Arius die, like the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia? Foul heretics &s;hould
die in foul places; dark holes for poi|&s;oned
rats. And pray, Mi&s;s, what do
you think of Tim and Phil?"</P>
<P>"I am not acquainted with the names
of all the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Servants! I am &s;o u&s;ed to them,
that I always call them by the&s;e familiar
<PB N="17" REF="20">
names. I mean the dialogues of Timothy
and Philalethes. There your Tom Paines,
and all &s;uch Sadducees, are an&s;wered.
Have you got, Mi&s;s, all Sir Roger's
works, and a good number of the pam|phlets
of Cromwell's times? I collect and
read all;&mdash;&s;mall type, large paper, and
thick volume. I love tugging at a book,
not &s;kimming like a mealy butterfly."</P>
<P>"Really, Mrs. Bully, all your authors
are not even known to me by name.
I have only two books, I think printed
by one of Cromwell's party, and tho&s;e
are the Paradi&s;es of Milton."</P>
<P>"Abominable! I marvel, Mi&s;s, how
you can bear a page of &s;uch "a blind
guide," as Sir Roger wittily called him.
His eyes &s;hewed a judgment of heaven.
No wonder he drew the devil &s;o well,
for he was only de&s;cribing his protector
Oliver. He'll protect him finely in the
eternity of hell torments; &s;ecretary now
<PB N="18" REF="21">
to Lucifer! And pray, Mi&s;s, how do
you like South for his joking &s;ermons;
and the elegant Stanhope on the epi&s;tles,
who ob&s;erves, that an unbeliever, if he
were in heaven, would find no more
plea&s;ure there, than a pig in a drawing-room;
and Scott, and Archbi&s;hop Laud,
and Bi&s;hop Blackhall, who&s;e works are in
three folios, heavier than I can hold in
my hands, and which I bought the other
day for three-pence each? A cur&s;e on
this Arian age! All weighty books now
are &s;elling by weight!"</P>
<P>"My favourite &s;ermons are tho&s;e of
Blair."</P>
<P>"Abominable! why they contain no|thing
but morality! not a word on the
conte&s;ted points of faith, the incarnation,
the con&s;ub&s;tantiality, grace, and ju&s;tifi|cation;
little a&s;thmatic periods, as if he
wanted &s;en&s;e to carry him through a dozen
words. You have a great deal to learn,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
Mi&s;s, on the &s;core of religion and politics.
You think I don't read novels; but I
like much tho&s;e in folio. I am now read|ing
the great Ca&s;&s;andra, and the no|ble
Oroondates. That Oroondates was a
brave fellow; he killed above fifty he|roes,
almo&s;t as brave as him&s;elf; and his
&s;peeches are ten hone&s;t pages in length;
none of your &s;queaking heroes, who are
afraid to &s;peak out like men; but I
know the rea&s;on, for their authors have
nothing for them to &s;ay."</P>
<P>"I could never read (&s;aid Emily) tho&s;e
voluminous romances. Their heroes and
heroines are a di&s;tinct order of beings
from our&s;elves; and I have my &s;u&s;picions,
whether they ever exi&s;ted but in the
prurient fancies of their authors. Their
de&s;criptions are never local, one place is
depicted like another; their &s;tyle is in|&s;ufferably
languid; their incidents, with|out
being romantic, violate the known
<PB N="20" REF="23">
cu&s;toms of every age; and their authors
&s;eem to have merely de&s;poiled Homer of
his true heroes, to transform them into
the di&s;gu&s;ting petit-maitres of Paris. A
race that, when they exi&s;ted, were only
ridiculed, and that now are quite ob&s;o|lete.
Such are their protracted conclu|&s;ions,
that we cannot but quite forget
what we had read, &s;hould we ever arrive
at the clo&s;e of the twelfth volume."</P>
<P>"Abominable! I forget nothing.
Since, Mi&s;s, you don't like bulky books,
mayhap you have never read the Bible
through?"</P>
<P>"Many parts I have never fini&s;hed.
I would neither corrupt my imagination
with impurity, nor &s;teel my heart by bar|barous
narratives and &s;anguinary per&s;e|cutions."</P>
<P>"Then the Lord pre&s;erve you from
damnation! Samuel hewed Agag alive,
and he did well; he was an Arian of his
<PB N="21" REF="24">
day. And the Phili&s;tines, the Canaanites,
the Hittites, and the Jebu&s;ites!&mdash;(&s;he ro&s;e

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Emily meets Charles and Vaurien. The
Di&s;&s;entions of two great Critics, &s;hewing
the Utility of Chri&s;tian Names.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Belfield contracted with
Emily a more pa&s;&s;ionate degree of
friend&s;hip than a lady of her high rank,
in general, is capable of experiencing;
but her Lady&s;hip is one of tho&s;e not very
rare in&s;tances, we imagine, where we ob|&s;erve
an amiable and ingenious female
&s;tudiou&s;ly annihilating her virtues and
her talents in the giddy, and often cri|minal,
vortex of di&s;&s;ipation. Nature will
&s;ometimes prevail over Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>One morning, when the&s;e two la|dies
were conver&s;ing with Mi&s;s Million,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
Charles and Vaurien were announced.
When they entered, their eyes were at
once directed on Emily; &s;he recogni&s;ed
Vaurien, and deeply blu&s;hed; her con|fu&s;ion
was fortunately concealed, while
Mi&s;s Million introduced the&s;e gentle|men.
Lady Belfield &s;aid, "Dear Mi&s;s
Emily, allow me to &s;peak a word for
one of the&s;e men; for that great child is
as &s;ilent as a Turki&s;h mute, (looking on
Charles); and half a word for the other,
who, I am &s;en&s;ible, wants no aid of mine
to engage the attentions of an accom|pli&s;hed
girl." Vaurien made a very ele|gant
compliment, and Charles a very
&s;ilent bow. Neither of the two ladies
&s;u&s;pected that they had ever met before;
and they them&s;elves did not chu&s;e to
notice their former rencounter at Mrs.
Wil&s;on's; for which, no doubt, each had
&s;ome peculiar rea&s;on, and which to di&s;|cover
may &s;erve, if the reader thinks
<PB N="25" REF="28">
proper, to exerci&s;e his thinking powers,
as well as his eyes, although the latter
are generally con&s;idered as the only re|qui&s;ites
for novel reading.</P>
<P>Vaurien was the &s;oul of the conver&s;a|tion.
He flew from topic to topic, and
poured out to Mi&s;s Million all the little
news that he had collected in the cour&s;e
of that morning's perambulation. He
hinted at a marriage, narrated a duel,
di&s;covered an intrigue, and informed
them, that la&s;t night Lady Bab lo&s;t ten
thou&s;and pounds at one &s;itting, and was
obliged to retire for the unexpected de|livery
of a &s;on and heir. He was a vo|lume
of &s;ecret memoirs; and every trifle
was embelli&s;hed by the graces of his
manner. To Emily he directed a richer
vein of conver&s;ation: he li&s;tened to the
copious catalogue of her talents, as given
by Mi&s;s Million; and when one of her
paintings was pointed out to his ob&s;er|vation,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
he gazed on it for &s;ome time,
commended it in a few energetic ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
and, at the &s;ame time, exhi|bited
his accuracy of ta&s;te by &s;ome &s;light
corrections, and his picture&s;que fancy,
by de&s;cribing how, from that &s;ubject,
another might be formed more romantic
to the imagination. Emily was more
gratified by this di&s;criminating critici&s;m
than the general applau&s;e of others, and
formed a high conception of that opu|lence
of fancy, which &s;eemed always to
enrich what it found. Lady Belfield in|treated
her to touch her harp; &s;he played
with her accu&s;tomed ea&s;e; and while &s;he
was receiving the thanks of her fair
friends, Vaurien &s;wept his hand carele&s;ly
over the in&s;trument, and called forth the
tendere&s;t air. Solicited to proceed, he
&s;aid: "Ah, no! I venture not above
a prelude, after harmonies like tho&s;e
which have now charmed. All my &s;kill
<PB N="27" REF="30">
is only an effu&s;ion of the heart, and all
my airs are only a few a&s;&s;ociations of the
memory, when I wandered in the viny
vales of Languedoc." Emily, it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, was delighted by the &s;ingular
ver&s;atility of his powers. Lady Belfield
rallied Vaurien upon this di&s;covery of his
harp mu&s;ic: "What a dangerous man
are you, Vaurien, when you can conceal
even little accompli&s;hments, that they
may be re&s;erved to &s;urpri&s;e and delight
on the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive occa&s;ion. It is to
Mi&s;s Emily we owe your performance on
the harp. But you, Charles, neither &s;ay,
nor do any thing."</P>
<P>"Your Lady&s;hip knows (replied
Charles) that &s;ome are born to embel|li&s;h
life by all that it has of the agree|able,
while others mu&s;t re&s;trict them&s;elves
to admire and love that merit they dare
not rival."</P>
<P>Emily liked Charles for this liberal
commendation of a per&s;on who was evi|dently
<PB N="28" REF="31">
his rival; that is a merit (&s;he
thought) &s;uperior to the merit it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Vaurien had now come down to the
very la&s;t morning anecdote; and he knew
that there was a certain point in conver|&s;ation,
when an able and &s;agacious talker
takes his departure. It is that point, at
which what we have &s;aid leaves a lively
impre&s;&s;ion on our friends; a quarter of
an hour more would weary, or le&s;s would
not &s;atisfy. It exacts no ordinary judg|ment
to know when to quit a chair.
The exhau&s;ted Frenchman was now ri&s;ing,
when the two great critics, Mr. Acrid
and Mr. Antique, were announced. With
indecent ha&s;te Antique ru&s;hed in, breath|le&s;s.
"I have," cried he "got near a whole
page traced accurately on oiled paper.
I tell you, Mr. Acrid, 'tis an original.
We have had a &s;ecret committee; but
no one can read it except Ireland; he is
in&s;pired; he reads it ju&s;t as if it were his
own writing!"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">
"And have you a page of Shak&s;peare
never read before?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Million.</P>
<P>Antique. "I heard Dr. Parr &s;ay, that
he mu&s;t expre&s;s his <HI>conviction</HI> in periods
more <HI>dignified</HI> than Ireland could roll. I
&s;aw Bo&s;well fall on his knees, rai&s;e his
hands, and thank God!"</P>
<P>"Mere antiquaries are ever to be
duped," replied Mr. Acrid with a dic|tatorial
tone. "Without ta&s;te to di&s;|cern,
penetration to decide, or that illu|minating
&s;agacity that combines it's un|erring
calculations; with a brainle&s;s head
and &s;ightle&s;s eyes, you pore on in&s;crip|tions,
&s;epulchral monuments, and manu|&s;cripts
that would never have been &s;uch,
had they merited literary honours. You
only read the dullne&s;s of other times, and
call this erudition; the gro&s;s je&s;ts of our
gro&s;s forefathers, and you conceive you
are men of wit. You di&s;cover &s;ome
clum&s;y uten&s;il, and you engrave it as a
model for modern elegance. The dulle&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="33">
writer of a dull age, becomes to the mere
antiquary the mo&s;t precious of his own
times; and yet &s;uch bear no other re|&s;emblance
to Midas than by his exterior
&s;ign, their touch cannot turn lead into
gold. You have already &s;tifled poor
Shak&s;peare by your commentaries, the
text cannot breathe freely amid&s;t your
incumbrances. Here is a man who
writes with an orthography of his own
invention, and in a &s;tyle that has no in|vention
at all; and every fool of learning
is &s;ummoned to admire a modern &s;keleton
in an ancient leaden coffin. But did not
my friend George take the true dimen|&s;ions
of the intellects of the director of
your wor&s;hipful &s;ociety? A curved cor|ner
of an old chimney-piece, duly &s;teeped
in what &s;hall be namele&s;s, till it became
variegated with the dark rainbow hues
of antiquity, and, ta&s;ted by his &s;agacious
finger, &s;melt of other times, was engraved
with &s;ome Saxon characters, and the name
<PB N="31" REF="34">
of Hardycknute; at length, being pro|perly
vinegared and verdigrea&s;ed, it ex|cited
his antiquarian curio&s;ity; he doats
on it to madne&s;s, makes &s;yllables of let|ters
and words of &s;yllables, and enriches
the archives of your &s;ociety with a mo&s;t
learned di&s;&s;ertation on the drinking-horn
of Hardy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">knute! Lay your Ireland's
Shak&s;peare on this curved corner of an
old chimney-piece."</P>
<P>The laugh went again&s;t Mr. Antique,
who &s;at down much cooler than he came
in, muttering vengeance. A circum|&s;tance
occurred to the&s;e two great cri|tics,
which may &s;erve as an exemplary
le&s;&s;on to &s;ome greater ones, to under|&s;tand
each other when their di&s;putes run
loud and &s;welling as a ru&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ing torrent,
or quick and fiery as kindled &s;traw. Mr.
Antique was a virtuo&s;o and a collector,
more famous for his library than his
learning; wealthy in medals, profound in
title-pages, an ogler of &s;tatues, and a
<PB N="32" REF="35">
great admirer of the works of nature
when they appeared in the forms of but|terflies,
pebbles, and conchae veneris; he
therefore was tolerably read in authors
who had written on <HI>curious</HI> &s;ubjects; but
Mr. Acrid held &s;uch authors in &s;overeign
contempt, and vociferated his raptures
for writers of ta&s;te. In point of under|&s;tanding,
or intellectual power, he was
much on an equality with his brother
critic, whom he &s;o much contemned.
Not but that his critici&s;ms were ex|tremely
ju&s;t, which they could not fail
to be, as they were, with little variation,
the &s;entiments of the noble&s;t critics; and
yet we are informed, that his entire li|brary
con&s;i&s;ted of only two biographical
dictionaries, &s;o that he travelled on the
high roads of literature merely at the
public expence; and when it happened
that he was &s;topped at a turnpike-gate,
he only di&s;covered his extreme poverty.
The following dialogue now en&s;ued:&mdash;</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<P>Antique. "You will find a very mi|nute
detail of that picture in Richard|&s;on."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Richard&s;on detail a picture!
Not he. He was no petty virtuo&s;o."</P>
<P>Antique. "Mr. Richard&s;on no vir|tuo&s;o!
Give me leave to affirm, that he
is at the head of our virtuo&s;os. He was
both a curious collector and a very mi|nute
de&s;criber."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Richard&s;on a puny col|lector!
Sir, it is fal&s;e, very fal&s;e. That
he was a minute de&s;criber I agree."</P>
<P>Antique. "I repeat he was a curious
collector. I retort your charge. I know
he prolonged his tour, and remained
above a year at Rome. It took him
three months only to de&s;cribe one of
Pou&s;&s;in's pictures."</P>
<P>Acrid. "He never was out of Eng|land.
His imagination was a true Bri|ti&s;h
&s;ea-coal fire, and borrowed not a
&s;park from a foreign rival."</P>
<PB N="34" REF="37">
<P>Antique. "Not out of England! I
&s;hall grow mad! 'Tis a calumny which
only an in&s;idious enemy could propa|gate.
His very minute de&s;criptions te&s;|tify
his ocular examination. His works
give us the very attitudes."</P>
<P>Acrid. "So, Sir, you think that a
man mu&s;t travel out of England to catch
tho&s;e correct re&s;emblances which true
ta&s;te admires. Truly your ta&s;te is &s;in|gular;
but his works are immortal."</P>
<P>Antique. "Immortal! Why no man of
any ta&s;te would give them hou&s;e-room."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Not Richard&s;on's works
hou&s;e-room! (he lifted his hands higher
than his head)</P>
<P>"O! for &s;hame, Mr. Antique," &s;aid
Mi&s;s Million. "No one can agree with
you there."</P>
<P>Antique. "Why they are all daubs;
mere garret furniture."</P>
<P>Acrid. "I lo&s;e my patience&mdash;I am
nearly &s;uffocated with rage. Do you
<PB N="35" REF="38">
mean, Mr. Antique, to in&s;ult me by
in&s;ulting Richard&s;on?"</P>
<P>Antique. "Mr. Acrid, do you mean
to reflect on my connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip, by &s;up|po&s;ing
that I could approve of his wretched
works? Where are they now to be found?
All gone and forgotten!"</P>
<P>Here Mr. Acrid ro&s;e in great pa&s;&s;ion,
looked with a di&s;tortion of countenance
on Mr. Antique, a mixture of fiercene&s;s
and contempt; then &s;moothing his face
into a &s;ardonic &s;mile, that is, with a
gay countenance and an aching heart, he
turned to the ladies, and appealed to
them, if Richard&s;on's works were not in
every body's hands, and in every col|lection
of ta&s;te?</P>
<P>Antique. "In every body's hands, and
in every collection of ta&s;te! Was ever man
&s;o provoked and in&s;ulted as I am?"</P>
<P>Acrid. "His fable is protracted, but
his lively and delicate &s;trokes place every
object before the eye."</P>
<PB N="36" REF="39">
<P>Antique. "What do you mean by
his fable? But I confe&s;s his minutene&s;s
is admirable."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Every character is &s;o pro|minent,
it is as in the great original of
nature."</P>
<P>Antique. "Agreed, as to the great
original; but nature is quite a &s;uperflu|ous
term.</P>
<P>Acrid. "The artle&s;s &s;entiments of
Pamela, the refined delicacy of Clari&s;&s;a,
the elevation of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on."</P>
<P>Antique. "What connexion have
the&s;e novels with the works of Richard|&s;on?
I could never read them. No
facts, all imagination.</P>
<P>Acrid. "With this avowal, you yet
pre&s;ume to appreciate the merits of Ri|chard&s;on;
you a&s;pire to dictate as an ar|biter
of ta&s;te!"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Million. "Dear Mr. Antique,
is this po&s;&s;ible? never read Richard|&s;on!"</P>
<PB N="37" REF="40">
<P>Antique. "Have you all con&s;pired
together to make me crazy? I &s;hake
with indignation. Do you &s;uppo&s;e that
I, who attend every picture &s;ale in town,
can read &s;uch enormous novels? I have
enough to do to read through all the &s;ale
catalogues of books and pictures; and I
have an entire collection, with their prices
marked, for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t; an
invaluable library of catalogues. If Jo|nathan
Richard&s;on the father, not Jona|than
Richard&s;on the &s;illy &s;on, the fir&s;t of
whom I have been talking of, had &s;een
them, what volumes of critici&s;m had come
out!"</P>
<P>Acrid. "<HI>Jonathan</HI> Richard&s;on! why,
man, we have been talking of <HI>Samuel</HI>
Richard&s;on! I know nothing of your
pair of <HI>Jonathans!</HI>"</P>
<P>Antique. "Then, po&s;itively, my dear
Acrid, we are all in a mi&s;take! I mean
Richard&s;on the painter, and you Richard|&s;on
<PB N="38" REF="41">
the noveli&s;t! You know the fir&s;t
has publi&s;hed &s;ome very curious di&s;&s;erta|tions
on his art; a great critic in paint|ing,
but the wor&s;t of painters! I prai&s;ed
his fine de&s;criptions of pictures, but could
never agree that his own works had any
merit. How the deuce has all this hap|pened?
As for the <HI>other</HI> Richard&s;on, I
know nothing about him; a collector
never values <HI>&s;uch writers.</HI></P>
<P>Acrid (with an air of triumph). "There,
ladies, Mr. Antique has confe&s;&s;ed he has
never read the great Richard&s;on, the
Shak&s;peare of noveli&s;ts; and yet he will
a&s;&s;ert and a&s;&s;ure you, that he can decide
on Shak&s;peare in manu&s;cript."</P>
<P>Antique. "That, my dear friend,
entirely con&s;i&s;ts in the foxine&s;s of the ink,
and the dingy fine yellow brown of the pa|per,
with the water-mark of the jug; all
worthy of the divine man! Let us not part
in anger. Critics &s;hould be more cautious
<PB N="39" REF="42">
in their controver&s;ies, and chri&s;tian names
are full as u&s;eful as &s;urnames."</P>
<P>Through the interce&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s Mil|lion,
peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed between this
couple of critics; but a latent revenge
rankled in the brea&s;t of Antique, for
Acrid's contempt of him, and Ireland's
Shak&s;peare; and when Mi&s;s Million en|quired
the literary news of the day, he took
an opportunity to di&s;til his gall on Acrid's
di&s;cernment. We &s;hall therefore re&s;ume
our dialogue.</P>
<P>Antique. "We have &s;ome important
intelligence in the republic of letters; you
have not then heard concerning Eliza?"</P>
<P>"All that we under&s;tand (&s;aid Mi&s;s
Million) is that the amatory effu&s;ions of
Eliza are only known for their delicacy,
their harmony, and their poetic beauty,
&s;o often admired by Mr. Acrid. The
fair &s;till is in the &s;hade."</P>
<P>Acrid here made a very curtailed bow,
and quickly retired.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43">
<P>Antique. "Ay! Ay! let him go!
let him go! to insult me with my defec|tive
ta&s;te for Shak&s;peare! Now, ladies,
judge what kind of di&s;cernment Mr. Acrid
is ble&s;t with. Eliza! Ha! ha! ha!"</P>
<P>"Eliza" exclaimed Mi&s;s Million "is
certainly a delightful poete&s;s! &s;he has
two great merits; &s;he not only writes
finely, but copiou&s;ly and ince&s;&s;antly.
Her la&s;t &s;weet pa&s;toral of 500 lines, is
excellent; but I wi&s;h &s;he had divided it
into five pa&s;torals. But the&s;e lines are

<P>Antique. "You don't know the
news, I &s;ee. You will agree with me,
that they mu&s;t be execrable. Why they are
Dick Di&s;tich's!"</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">
Mi&s;s Million. "O &s;hocking! what is
Eliza, Dick Di&s;tich?"</P>
<P>Antique. "Hear the anecdote! Dick
Di&s;tich, you know, wrote ver&s;es in all
mea&s;ures; but, in quantity, they were
without mea&s;ure. As he was &s;o kind as
to rever&s;e his name at the clo&s;e of his
poems, it was of u&s;e to the incautious.
Ridiculed, but not &s;o fortunate as to be
neglected, he retreated to the country in
a nervous fever. His name he knew would
damn his works; &s;o calling him&s;elf Eliza,
and getting a female friend to tran&s;cribe
his poems, he &s;ent them to the famous
paper. All the old Cru&s;cans ro&s;e to a
man! Odes, elegies, and &s;onnets, were
poured on Eliza, enough to have made
a fine &s;now-&s;hower at Drury Lane.
Eliza was rather broad and warm in her
diction. She was a Sappho, a tenth mu&s;e,
and a fourth grace. Our poets were ena|moured
of this mo&s;t &s;en&s;itive Eliza.
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Acrid was as clamorous in his raptures,
as fifty amorous cats on the pantiles.
He imagined her to be the old Laura;
&s;o he addre&s;&s;ed her with this tender billet:
"Amiable Eliza! I love you; can you
pardon the avowal? But I have made it;
and I know not to repeat of it. My
pa&s;&s;ion is like your genius; it terrifies or
&s;oothes; hope and de&s;pair prey on my
&s;oul. Hope! alas! I do not hope, and
yet I love." The an&s;wer of Eliza to this
amatory note, was the mo&s;t con&s;olatory,
and bid him hope for every favour; but
&s;he added, "What if you knew me?
would your cla&s;&s;ical eye approve of my
per&s;on? Alas! I am &s;hort and brown;
but &s;o was Sappho; my no&s;e is &s;nubbed;
but &s;o was the beautiful Poppaea's; I
have a &s;ingular cu&s;tom when I ki&s;s to
bite; but &s;uch were the marks of fondne&s;s
which Flora left on her Pompey. If my
per&s;onal defects can thus be forgiven, as &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="46">
many cla&s;&s;ical imitations are in my ver&s;es;
then will Sappho receive you as her
Phaon; but, I fear, faithle&s;s and accom|pli&s;hed
as that boy." An appointment
was made. Dick invited &s;everal friends
to witne&s;s the lover's fir&s;t interview. We
&s;tood behind a &s;creen; the great critic
arrived; when lo! to the credit of his
critical talents, his Eliza &s;tood before
him, in the contemned per&s;on of poor
Dick Di&s;tich. What's the con&s;equence?
The critic's reputation has received the
<HI>coup de grace,</HI> while Eliza's ver&s;es are now
all condemned in one ma&s;s. What was
&s;weet fancy in Eliza, is rank dulne&s;s in
Dick Di&s;tich. The poetical hermaphro|dite
has gained nothing; and the &s;ex are
but ill complimented; for when Dick was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be a woman, tho&s;e ver&s;es
were applauded, which are now con|demned
becau&s;e he is a man. So, ladies,
I recommend the poor devil to your pro|tection."</P>

"Lord! I wi&s;h I had known all this
before," cried Mi&s;s Million. "Here is a

been applauding the narcotic infu&s;ions of
Dick Di&s;tich, while we thought them
the di&s;&s;olving effu&s;ions of a Sappho. How
can one judge of people's poetry, if they
deceive us with names?"</P>
<P>"In the&s;e ca&s;es" ob&s;erved Charles, "we

<P>VAURIEN had become the <HI>friend</HI>
of Lady Belfield; and this word,
even in the dictionary of fa&s;hionable lan|guage,
has not degenerated into a non-entity;
but the adroitne&s;s of vice, knows
to di&s;gui&s;e it's impurities, by adorning
them with the holy titles that are &s;acred
to virtue; it is thus that it's gro&s;&s;ne&s;s is con|cealed,
it's deformity invites, and it's horrors
are crowned with delights that are not it's
own. We think, at fir&s;t, that we enjoy
love, when we gra&s;p at lu&s;t; that we are
&s;oothed by friend&s;hip, when we li&s;ten to &s;y|cophancy;
and that we pur&s;ue amu&s;ement
<PB N="46" REF="49">
when we are heavily dragged through di&s;|&s;ipation.
To the clear eye of rea&s;on, the
plea&s;ures of vice pay an involuntary tri|bute
of honour to virtue, by a&s;&s;uming it's
name; and it is at lea&s;t a con&s;olation to
&s;ome, and a conviction to many, that
vice would lo&s;e half of its &s;eduction, did
it not at fir&s;t appear in the di&s;gui&s;e of
&s;ome virtue.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield, enamoured of the gay
and accompli&s;hed. Frenchman, was for
&s;ome time occupied in his enjoyment;
but it was no &s;oothing alliance of the
heart; no imperi&s;hable union of two
kindred virtues; it was merely an inflam|mation
of the &s;en&s;es; a flame that raged
at intervals, and often &s;unk in the dying
embers of pa&s;&s;ion, and left behind them
the di&s;gu&s;ts of criminal plea&s;ure, the cold
a&s;hes of &s;atiety. The mode&s;t and re|&s;erved
Charles, &s;till agitated her &s;oul with
tho&s;e delicate impre&s;&s;ions, by which the
<PB N="47" REF="50">
blu&s;hing form of unpolluted man touches
and irritates even the bo&s;om of cor|ruption.
His mode&s;ty but inflamed de|&s;ire,
and his apathy was a my&s;tery
&s;he could not penetrate. In vain &s;he
planned occa&s;ions to &s;urprize him into
&s;eduction; his principles were firm; and
could they ever have yielded, another
pa&s;&s;ion at this time came to his aid, and
his heart was filled with the image of
Emily.</P>
<P>Charles had frequently entered into con|ver&s;ations
with this amiable girl, and &s;he
had di&s;covered in him a &s;ecret value which
was more delightful to her feelings when
ab&s;ent, than the recollection of Vaurien's
more applauded and dazzling qualities.
Vaurien fa&s;cinated in her pre&s;ence; Charles
enchanted in his ab&s;ence; one was to be
looked at, and the other was remembered.
The one was all that imagination could
form of the agreeable, and the other all
<PB N="48" REF="51">
that &s;entiment could form of the tender.
The voice of Vaurien was mu&s;ic that re|galed
the ear, but the voice of Charles
penetrated the ab&s;tract ear of memory.
Vaurien exhibited the mo&s;t agile graces
of form, the mo&s;t delightful amenity of
manners; and, never uniform, varied a
thou&s;and &s;hapes, and charmed in all.
Charles had nothing of this ver&s;atility;
he mu&s;ed, and was rarely gay; but there
was a &s;weetne&s;s in his &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and a
dignity in his comportment, which, by
it's very uniformity, impre&s;&s;ed a heart &s;u&s;|ceptible
of reflection and &s;entiment, with
features more prominent and energetic,
than the &s;ofter lineaments of Vaurien.
Vaurien never gained on reflection, all
was &s;een at once; nothing was concealed
for the private eye; he &s;educed the pub|lic
applau&s;e, but could not fix the
individual affection. Charles exhibited
a latent merit. His commone&s;t action
<PB N="49" REF="52">
proceeded from a &s;uperior impul&s;e. In
the &s;ilence of meditation, in that &s;ecret
hour when ab&s;ent from our friends, we
try, without pa&s;&s;ion, their merits, their
follies, and their weakne&s;&s;es, Vaurien
appeared a common man, who &s;eemed to
perform uncommon actions; and Charles
an uncommon man, who&s;e actions were
&s;et off neither by o&s;tentation nor &s;ingula|rity.
Vaurien po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind of Emily,
but Charles was the inmate of her heart.</P>
<P>Emily and Charles, amid&s;t their bril|liant
circles, &s;eemed only to ta&s;te of a
fugitive happine&s;s, when they could con|trive
to &s;it together, and indulge their
&s;ympathy of &s;entiment. In the eyes of
Emily might be read her &s;oul; &s;he look|ed
her thoughts; &s;he had none to di&s;|gui&s;e;
but &s;ome perplexities, &s;ome
blu&s;hes, &s;ome tremors, &s;he experienced in
the&s;e &s;hort interviews with Charles. He
<PB N="50" REF="53">
read to her, one day, the clo&s;e of the
Spring of Thom&s;on, where, with peculiar
&s;en&s;ibility, that poet of lovers rai&s;es a lit|tle
fairy exi&s;tence of conjugal felicity; a
fading dream, that claims a tear from the
eye it has &s;olaced; a heaven of love, that
charms and pains it's trembling, it's &s;uf|fering,
it's doubtful martyr. As he pro|ceeded,
his eyes wandered from the book
to Emily; he pronounced words while
attention wandered; he &s;topped &s;ud|denly;
Emily leant on his &s;houlder, to
look at the ver&s;e; &s;he &s;aw a tear gli&s;|ten
on the page. "You have mi&s;&s;ed whole
lines, Sir," &s;aid &s;he. "I will recom|mence
the pa&s;&s;age, Mi&s;s Emily; I was
thinking that the tender Thom&s;on loved
and was beloved, yet knew not the only
felicity of Love. I proceed&mdash;
<Q><L>What is the world to them!</L>
<L>Who in each other cla&s;p, whatever fair</L>

<L><PB N="51" REF="54">High fancy forms and lavi&s;h hearts can wi&s;h,</L>
<L>Something than beauty dearer, &s;hould they look</L>
<L>Or on the mind, or mind-illumin'd face&mdash;</L></Q>
Charles rai&s;ed his eye from the volume;
the face of Emily was covered with
blu&s;hes; &s;he gazed on him, and &s;eemed
to withdraw her eye with timidity, re|luctance,
and alarm. When he came to
the&s;e lines,
<Q><L>An elegant &s;ufficiency, content,</L>
<L>Retirement, rural quiet, friend&s;hip, books,</L>
<L>Ea&s;e and alternate labour, u&s;eful life,</L>
<L>Progre&s;&s;ive virtue, and approving Heaven.</L></Q>
Charles uttered an audible &s;igh. Emily,
&s;miling, &s;aid, "Sure that &s;igh was not
for Thom&s;on!"&mdash;"Ah! no, Mi&s;s Emily,
I wonder why I &s;igh; what lines can have
a le&s;s-adorned &s;implicity? and yet they
penetrate my heart. I fear that &s;igh was
nothing but vanity and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; it
was for my&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">
It is evident, that when Thom&s;on is
read by two young per&s;ons of either &s;ex,
with this ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibility, the Sea|&s;ons
threaten to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of
friend&s;hip by the intru&s;ion of love; and
when love is conducted by poetry, his
armed hand is wrapt beneath a gay man|tle,
and &s;trikes more deeply a perfidious
blow.</P>
<P>Emily's quiet was attempted to be
di&s;turbed by others. The Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion enli&s;ted among her
admirers. He was a boyi&s;h divine, a
ca&s;&s;ocked hunt&s;man, and a clerical buck.
His vi&s;its to Mi&s;s Million were not &s;o
uninterrupted as he de&s;ired, owing to his
father, an opulent Rector re&s;iding in
the vicinity of Sali&s;bury, and al&s;o to the
Bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e, who, as he ob|&s;erved,
was "a blockhead of the old
&s;chool." Indeed, this Bi&s;hop was by no
means a man of fa&s;hion; he bore a mo&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="56">
religious antipathy towards all tho&s;e young
clergymen who were in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
plurality of livings, and who e&s;caped from
them all to re&s;ide in the metropolis, and
to dre&s;s their hair as they thought proper.
Ephraim was the hope of his family, be|cau&s;e
he was the elde&s;t &s;on; he had there|fore
been his father's favourite in his cra|dle;
in which place the &s;acerdotal infant
may be &s;aid to have felt a &s;imoniacal
propen&s;ity, for indeed &s;imony was a <HI>con|&s;titutional</HI>
vice in that family. There, by
&s;ome ingenuity of his pious father the
Rector, he was inducted into two good
advow&s;ons, &s;o that ere the young gentle|man
i&s;&s;ued from his pupillage, he <HI>pre|&s;ented
him&s;elf</HI> to his own livings, and pi|ou&s;ly
undertook the cure of the &s;ouls of
&s;everal pari&s;hes. He was a young man
of mode&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and held in vene|ration
the holy profe&s;&s;ion; and as he at
once was a Nimrod in the field, and a
<PB N="54" REF="57">
Narci&s;&s;us within doors, he decently pro|cured
two per&s;ons to perform his own du|ties.
For this purpo&s;e he found two fa|thers
of large families, at the market-price
then of forty pounds a year. He
was al&s;o a rigid ob&s;erver of the utmo&s;t &s;o|lemnity
in the performance of all church
&s;ervices, and te&s;tified an uncommon zeal
for eccle&s;ia&s;tical rights; the former con|&s;i&s;ted
in the per&s;onal appearance of his
curates; and whenever he heard the
&s;lighte&s;t complaint of a na&s;al twang, or a
guttural dige&s;tion of words, or of a brown|i&s;h
black coat, &s;uch a curate was di&s;|charged
at a week's notice; and his zeal
for eccle&s;ia&s;tical rights was evidently ex|hibited
in his &s;eizure of all bands, black
gloves, white favours, funeral &s;carfs, and
the chri&s;tening or marriage guinea. On
the whole, he was a mo&s;t orthodox &s;up|porter
of the <HI>church</HI>; under&s;tanding by
this word a certain ancient building, en|circled
<PB N="55" REF="58">
by a burying-ground, and the in|terior
furni&s;hed with a certain water-ba|&s;on,
vulgarly denominated the bapti&s;mal
fount; burials and chri&s;tenings, therefore,
producing no incon&s;iderable income, he
mo&s;t zealou&s;ly &s;upported the afore&s;aid
<HI>church.</HI></P>
<P>But although a &s;turdy advocate for
church &s;ubordination, he could not con|&s;ent
to grant this to his Bi&s;hop. Too
active in field &s;ports during the &s;ummer,
and quite exhau&s;ted in town di&s;&s;ipa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ions
during the winter, he mo&s;t ju&s;tly com|plained
of the ince&s;&s;ant and per&s;onal at|tacks
of his &s;aid Bi&s;hop; who, particu|larly
at one of his annual dinners given
to his a&s;&s;embled brethren, did mo&s;t inde|licately
reprimand our fa&s;hionable Rector;
Vicar, and Prebendary, for all the&s;e ho|nours
and their appurtenances were united
in young Ephraim. He re&s;olved now
to throw off the yoke of eccle&s;ia&s;tical ju|ri&s;diction;
<PB N="56" REF="59">
and, to the great comfort of
our &s;acerdotal bucks, they may enjoy the
revenues of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, without the
<HI>bori&s;h</HI> performance of the functions.
Ephraim had great intere&s;t with the
Prince, for two rea&s;ons: In a drunken
frolic at Brighton, he had received the
honour of being thrown into a gravel|pit,
by which means he broke his leg;
but as his neck was entire, he did not
much lament the fracture, &s;ince it was
a kind of claim on princely patronage;
and the other rea&s;on was, that the Re|verend
Ephraim Dandelion was a per&s;on
of inimitable talent, in imitating the bray
of an a&s;s and the whine of a pig. The
a&s;s and the pig, with the above-men|tioned
da&s;h into the gravel-pit, procured
him an honorary place in the Prince's
army of Chaplains. This honour brings
with it the u&s;eful privilege of enabling
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to hold as many livings as
<PB N="57" REF="60">
he can get, while it comfortably relieves
him of the tedious duty of re&s;idence; &s;o
the happy Ephraim, a&s;piring now to a
Bi&s;hoprick, never more entered the pa|lace
of his Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Although we know of no facts (for of
facts &s;hould all true hi&s;tories like the
pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;t) that might tend to ac|cu&s;e
him of any venial liberalities to his
mi&s;erable curates, yet he was well ena|bled
to commit &s;uch follies; for he now
held, in livings and <HI>ceteras,</HI> above two
thou&s;and a year, according to his own
frequent avowal, and little le&s;s he ex|pected
from the worthy Rector his fa|ther,
who was of a mo&s;t plethoric habit,
was a Gargantua in point of &s;tomach,
one of the mo&s;t orthodox veni&s;on eaters
in his county, and had been twice touched
by an apoplexy.</P>
<P>A character more &s;ingular and inte|re&s;ting
was the voluptuous Sedley. A
<PB N="58" REF="61">
pa&s;&s;ion for &s;elf-enjoyment was the &s;ource
of his actions; his life was a &s;y&s;tem of
refined Epicuri&s;m; his &s;tudy was an art
to irritate de&s;ire, and to protract enjoy|ment;
to throw over the nudities of
imagination a thin and brilliant veil,
woven by the Graces. He was born with
a &s;en&s;itive heart and a romantic fancy,
but his natural benevolence was fre|quently
&s;acrificed to his artificial grati|fications;
yet of his dangerous talent,
his numerous victims rather murmured
than complained; their ruin &s;eemed a|dorned;
de&s;pair was half &s;oothed by the
memory of it's pa&s;t enjoyments; and,
at lea&s;t, the &s;incerity of their ma&s;ter was
evinced in his having become his own
victim. His fortune and his felicity were
alike exhau&s;ted in the fatal ravages of
his pa&s;&s;ions; a dark vacuity in his heart
terrified his &s;olitude; with all the fer|vour
of affection he found he could not&punc;
<PB N="59" REF="62">
love; with all the curious felicity of en|joyment
he found he had never enjoyed;
enervated by the angui&s;h of di&s;appoint|ment,
yet &s;timulated by the fever of hope,
he wandered in a tumultuous pur&s;uit of
that plea&s;ure, which, if fugitive, torment|ed
with de&s;ire; and, if embraced, &s;ickened
with &s;atiety.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething grand and ro|mantic
in his entire e&s;tabli&s;hment. All
the luxuries of Europe were his dome&s;tic
enjoyments; every &s;en&s;e was flattered,
and the imagination it&s;elf was attempt|ed,
to be &s;atisfied. He held a corre|&s;pondence
with foreign parts, to import
every novelty of refined &s;en&s;uality; and
the &s;ame &s;hip often conveyed to him,
a picture of Raphael, a hog&s;head of
Montepulciano, and a female &s;elected for
&s;ome peculiarity of &s;eature. His hou&s;es
re&s;ounded with mu&s;ic; and all the arts
of amenity crouded to the opulent idler.
<PB N="60" REF="63">
The heats of &s;ummer were cooled by the
ices of winter; and his winter garden was
prodigal of the ro&s;es of &s;ummer. Every
day he religiou&s;ly gratified his five &s;en&s;es.
It was this Engli&s;hman of whom Mercier
relates, that he boa&s;ted of having ac|quired
a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ted in the
&s;ingular fancy of a&s;&s;embling females, who
re&s;embled by their features the beauties
of other times. He di&s;per&s;ed through|out
Europe portraits of his ancient fa|vourites;
and &s;ometimes prolonged his
mornings with the Scotti&s;h Mary and
Anne Bullen, and &s;ometimes was &s;eated
at &s;upper between Cleopatra and Poppaea.
The illu&s;ion was &s;till further promoted by
pre&s;erving their <HI>co&s;tume,</HI> and dre&s;&s;ing every
beauty according to the country and the
age &s;he per&s;onified.</P>
<P>In his country retreat he was charmed
by an Arcadian ta&s;te, and realized the
romance of the golden age. There he
<PB N="61" REF="64">
would habit him&s;elf as a &s;hepherd, and
walking by the &s;ide of a &s;tage-dancer, his
favourite &s;ultana, while &s;he played on a
little harp, he held a crook in his hand,
a ba&s;ket at his &s;ide, and wore a &s;traw hat
wreathed with ro&s;es. In the &s;emblance
of peace and enjoyment, he wandered
through the winding alleys of &s;pring, and
di&s;ported in the rich &s;hrubberies of his
ground. His companions at di&s;tance war|bled
their tendere&s;t airs, and the &s;ympho|nies
of mu&s;ical in&s;truments re&s;ponded to
the harp of his &s;hepherde&s;s. Nightingales,
trained for this purpo&s;e, i&s;&s;ued from their
ne&s;ts, and &s;ettling, &s;ome near the fanta&s;ti|cal
Arcadian, and &s;ome on the harp of
his mi&s;tre&s;s, rivalled her provoking me|lodies,
fluttered, fainted, and fell at her
feet.</P>
<P>To &s;uch puerilities can de&s;cend the in|ordinate
indulgence of an ungoverned
fancy; and in vain will the incredulous,
<PB N="62" REF="65">
in his circum&s;cribed experience, cen&s;ure
the&s;e in&s;tances, as the ideal pictures of an
author's heated fancy, &s;ince the&s;e are facts
&s;anctioned by their truth; and others, not
of an inferior extravagance, not long ago
amu&s;ed the tedium of the exi&s;tence of a
noble Lord.</P>
<P>But in Sedley, his puerilities were not
unaccompanied with ta&s;te, nor was his
voluptuou&s;ne&s;s inhuman and void of ele|vation.
Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s had made him no
otherwi&s;e to be condemned, than in tho&s;e
&s;educing powers, and tho&s;e brilliant illu|&s;ions,
which betrayed the &s;en&s;ibility of the
feminine heart. The voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of a
woman can never be pardoned; cha&s;tity
is like a &s;eal to a rich ca&s;ket, which, while
pre&s;erved entire, we know can never have
been pillaged of it's gems. Sen&s;uality is
ma&s;culine, for it is gro&s;s; let the crime
and the puni&s;hment be re&s;erved for man.
Sedley was, otherwi&s;e, the friend of hu|man
<PB N="63" REF="66">
nature, and loved the enjoyments of
others, becau&s;e to him it was an enjoyment.
But when, at certain intervals, his &s;en&s;es
were exhau&s;ted, recollection obtruded it|&s;elf
on his &s;tartled mind; it came in the
wan form of &s;atiety, that &s;pectre of de|parted
plea&s;ure! The images of tho&s;e he
had rendered mi&s;erable, of &s;ome the &s;ui|cides,
and of others the lives, gave to his
repentant heart the pains them&s;elves had
experienced. The gay Sedley &s;hed the
bittere&s;t tears in &s;ilence; and he mourned
at once the unhappine&s;s of his compa|nions
and his own. "I am a wretch,"
he would &s;ay, "but not from the malice
of my heart, but from it's pervading &s;oft|ne&s;s;
I peri&s;h with tho&s;e that I have lo&s;t,
and I have not inflicted one pang on
others, which I would not bear my&s;elf&mdash;Not I! but Nature is inhuman; I li&s;ten
to her voice, the wanderings of my heart
are her in&s;pirations, and if &s;he betrays
<PB N="64" REF="67">
tho&s;e whom &s;he conducts, who can wre&s;|tle
with the divinity of Nature? She has
given too few &s;en&s;es, and too numerous
de&s;ires; and nature forms her&s;elf the tor|turing
&s;courge, that affrights and afflicts
the gentle&s;t of the human race!" Such
was the character, and &s;uch the reflec|tions
of Sedley.</P>
<P>At a morning vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Million,
Emily, not being pre&s;ent, became the &s;ub|ject
of their animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>"She is certainly a d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> fine girl,
only too mode&s;t," &s;aid the Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion.</P>
<P>"O!" exclaimed Mi&s;s Million, "you
can't conceive what va&s;t plea&s;ure it has
given me, to have found out the old blind
Lieutenant's daughter. When I &s;aw her
at Exmouth, I repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed her
with invitations to Portman-&s;quare, but
never expected to &s;ee the poor thing.
There &s;he was quite &s;olitary and timid.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68">
"We &s;hall then beat her hollow,"
cried Dandelion, "for a hare is &s;oli|tary
and timid, but yields as fine &s;port
as a fox."</P>
<P>"She is a delicious creature!" cried
Sedley.</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t amiable and accompli&s;hed!"
&s;aid Lady Belfield.</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t fa&s;cinating!" &s;aid Vaurien.</P>
<P>"I think" gravely ob&s;erved Charles, "&s;he will be in &s;ome danger among
us all."</P>
<P>"What danger, Sir?" &s;harply repri|manded
Lady Belfield. "I will an&s;wer
for you po&s;itively. A young woman is
never in danger in the great world, among
the mo&s;t poli&s;hed part of &s;ociety. We
do not blazon forth every ca&s;ual indi&s;|cretion;
an honourable &s;ilence protects a
woman; while in your plebeian circles,
the &s;lighte&s;t gallantries are con&s;trued into
unpardonable levities; the mo&s;t agreeable
<PB N="66" REF="69">
fleurettes are &s;uppo&s;ed to be declarations
of love; and if an a&s;&s;ignation &s;hould be
di&s;covered, the whole family, venerable
papa, the little &s;i&s;ter, and the tall brother,
and the whole generation take the alarm.
A duel and a divorce complete the vulgar
farce; nothing le&s;s will do than an ab&s;o|lute
Lucretia! who&s;e hi&s;tory no one cre|dits
more than Curtius leaping into the
great gulf."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Lady Belfield," replied Mi&s;s
Million, "I had forgot to mention to you,
that half of Mr. Charles' merits are lo&s;t in
his morality. What is meant by this &s;ame
morality? I am &s;ure it gives no know|ledge
of the world; for Lord Che&s;ter|field's
divine works they &s;ay are immoral,
and the in&s;upportable Rambler they &s;ay
is a very moral work. But, Lord! don't
let us talk of morality! it always brings
on my nervous complaint. I do not know
what to do with my&s;elf this whole day.
<PB N="67" REF="70">
(the yawned) I wi&s;h I had &s;ome new
place to go to."</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t now," &s;aid Vaurien, "the Lord
Mayor's &s;how is &s;etting off from the Man|&s;ion-hou&s;e.
What do you think of a ride
to the city?"</P>
<P>"O, vulgar!" cried Mi&s;s Million, "I
never drive into the city but on Sundays;
the &s;treets are &s;o narrow, and the carts are
&s;o broad! But what does your Lady&s;hip
think of this &s;how?"</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Conver&s;ation with a philo&s;ophical
Voluptuary.</HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE brought," &s;aid Sedley, as
he returned, "a ver&s;ion of my fa|vourite
poet; here it is, Mi&s;s Emily,
for you was it compo&s;ed; but even you
have failed to in&s;pire me with the deli|cacy
and amenity of the voluptuous Ana|creon
of France. <HI>L'Art d'Aimer</HI> of Ber|nard
cannot be tran&s;lated, at lea&s;t permit
me thus to con&s;ole my own inability.
Could you but catch the &s;eductive graces
of the original, I &s;hould trace, in the
touching languor of your eye, the en|chantment
of your heart. He is the Al|bano
of poetry. In his amiable minia|tures
<PB N="72" REF="75">
he paints the playful triumphs or
the children of love; fervid, yet cha&s;te;
true, yet flattering. It is only nature
embelli&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Bernard was my friend, as well as ma&s;|ter;
he was the mo&s;t amiable man at the
mo&s;t amiable court. An arbiter elegan|tiarum
in the mo&s;t refined circles at Pa|ris;
the art of plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation was
&s;till more &s;en&s;ibly felt than the art of de|lighting
by his graceful and di&s;&s;olving
ver&s;e. Voltaire con&s;idered him as a pro|digy
of elegant voluptuou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In noticing Saint Bernard, and another Bernard celebrated for his wealth, he adds,
<Q><L>Le troi&s;ieme e&s;t l'enfant de Ph&eacute;bus,</L>

<L>Doit &s;aire encore les delices du monde,</L>

ver&s;es re&s;pire a continued &s;oftne&s;s, are
gay with a thou&s;and pictures, and are the
<PB N="73" REF="76">
enamellings of poetry. In his manners,
what ea&s;y, yet re&s;i&s;tle&s;s grace! No man
had &s;o much of that light flower of ta&s;te
which blooms but for a rapid moment,
tho&s;e brilliant colours that fade while we
gaze on them. Ah! that any thing of
Bernard &s;hould be peri&s;hable!"</P>
<P>"Mr. Sedley," interrupted Emily, "I
love all kinds of enthu&s;iam; but in this
ca&s;e, as you labour with great perplexity
to de&s;cribe your ma&s;ter, tell me at once
he was an effeminate, refined, and lively
Frenchman."</P>
<P>"For your &s;ex his pa&s;&s;ion was exce&s;&s;ive;
but he was incon&s;tant; and yet, Mi&s;s Emi|ly,
he was beloved. Not a Pari&s;ian beau|ty
complained of his infidelities; for the
charms of his genius they pardoned the
wanderings of his heart; and he cen&s;ures
his own incon&s;tancies with &s;uch gaiety, that
they &s;eem to be only &s;o many triumphs.</P>
<P>"I know not how it happened, but poor
<PB N="74" REF="77">
Bernard &s;urvived him&s;elf. In my la&s;t re|&s;idence
at Paris, I found the voluptuous
poet a mere &s;hadow of exi&s;tence; and he
who had charmed by the lightne&s;s and
the tenderne&s;s of his effu&s;ions, was then a
mute idiot. I have been at the opera
with him when they performed his own
admirable Ca&s;tor and Pollux. He gazed
with a vacant eye, and we could draw no
other conver&s;ation from him than ince&s;|&s;ant
enquiries if his Maje&s;ty was &s;atis|fied?
If Madame de Pompadour was
plea&s;ed? Courtier to the la&s;t, the royal
favour was the &s;olitary &s;entiment that oc|cupied
the in&s;en&s;ate idiot. Ah! Mi&s;s
Emily, it was an humiliation for the man
of plea&s;ure and the man of wit, to view
their gay and amiable chief with eyes
that di&s;tilled unmeaning tears, an exani|mate
frame that &s;at motionle&s;s, and who&s;e
voice could not utter an expre&s;&s;ion but
which confirmed his idioti&s;m."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">
"The title of his poem," ob&s;erved
Emily, "is to me a condemning criti|ci&s;m.
I &s;hould be very &s;orry, I a&s;&s;ure
you, to be <HI>taught</HI> an "Art of Love." I
fear it is a misfortune for mo&s;t in the&s;e
times to be in love without art. But by
your account of Bernard I am much gra|tified;
you know I am delighted by a
moral tale, and I think your's is ex|tremely
moral; it is a true and melan|choly
picture of tho&s;e fooli&s;h wits, who,
abandoned to the fury of their pa&s;&s;ions,
are not le&s;s pernicious to them&s;elves than
to their neighbours. Since you have
printed this dangerous poem, have the
candour to give this la&s;t anecdote of Ber|nard's
life, as a preface or a po&s;t&s;cript.
Mr. Sedley will believe me, when I &s;ay I
am not fa&s;tidiou&s;ly moral; I do not con|&s;ider
every deviation from our own ac|cu&s;tomed
habits to be turpitude, or even
error. I have &s;een prudes grow outrage|ous
<PB N="76" REF="79">
at freedoms with their per&s;ons, which
I &s;hould con&s;ider as very inoffen&s;ive. If
I were in France, where, I am told, the
ladies indulge in many familiarities, more
harmle&s;s than they &s;eem, I think I &s;hould
only con&s;ider them as local cu&s;toms. But
libertini&s;m, Mr. Sedley, in whatever form
it comes, whether it be gay with the &s;pi|rits
of youth, or vapid with the tremors
of age, adorned by the charms of ver&s;e, or
&s;y&s;tematized by the philo&s;ophy of pro&s;e, is
irreconcilable to my feelings. I will not
look for the rea&s;ons that may have ex|cited
its abhorrence; it is enough for me,
that it's in&s;pection rai&s;es a di&s;gu&s;t &s;o na|tural
and energetic, that I lo&s;e my pa|tience
when I &s;eek for rea&s;ons. I do
not know that I could give any &s;atisfac|tory
rea&s;on why I prefer perfumes to
ordures, but that my organs are &s;o framed
as to be attracted by the one, and to be
repul&s;ed by the other. In the&s;e ca&s;es,
<PB N="77" REF="80">
the be&s;t rea&s;on will be, in not attempting
to rea&s;on; as, to return to your poem, all
my art of love will, I hope, be, to have
no art at all."</P>
<P>"A &s;light mi&s;conception, not a differ|ence
in opinion, amiable Mi&s;s Emily!
has afforded you this vindictive exulta|tion.
How ju&s;tly you ob&s;erve, that there
are rapid &s;en&s;ations which are &s;o natural
as not to exact the frigid and impotent
efforts of an inactive rea&s;on. Do not
form &s;uch &s;erious, &s;uch gloomy notions
of love; look not on it's innocent plea|&s;ures
with the melancholy eye of rea&s;on.
You have been told, that the de&s;ires of
love are crimes, but they are only amu&s;e|ments;
you con&s;ider him as a tyrant or a
traitor, but he is only an amiable boy;
he exacts but one gentle conce&s;&s;ion, &s;o
well expre&s;&s;ed by Thom&s;on, when he
&s;ays&mdash;
<Q><PB N="78" REF="81">
<L>Thought meeting thought, and will prevent|ting

<L>With boundle&s;s confidence&mdash;</L></Q>
It is this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;entiment, tender and
ingenuous; prompt, yet durable; ar|dent,
yet continued that diffu&s;es the
&s;oul in the &s;en&s;es; and, fertile and eager
in de&s;ire, lives and increa&s;es on the o'er|flowing

<L>Dure, et s'augmente, au comble des plai&s;irs.</L></Q></P></NOTE>. Who more
mode&s;t and retired than a &s;en&s;itive lover?
In &s;hade and in &s;ilence are all the &s;urtive
care&s;&s;es of love received. Love is a &s;e|cret
enjoyment, it admits of no partici|pation;
it is for the applau&s;e of his mi&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="79" REF="82">
and not for that of the world, a lover
pants.</P>
<P>"Lament then with me, my dear Mi&s;s
Emily, the prejudices of our age and our
country; how rarely does love unite two
hearts in the &s;anctioned plea&s;ures of ma|trimony!
The conjugal couch we con|&s;ider
as polluted, when two congenial
&s;pirits meet&mdash;but meet too late; and
&s;hould they love as nature dictates to the
heart, we reproach them, we di&s;grace
them, we hara&s;s them with the iron ma|nacles
of law. Unnatural laws, but mo&s;t
natural loves! How often have I wi&s;hed
to have been an inmate of tho&s;e countries
which we call barbarous, but which I ad|mire,
as the only regions where nature is
not offended by the haughty temerity of
man! O! happy people, where the lover
compo&s;es his fragrant letter with the
fre&s;he&s;t flowers; where the yellow jonquil
tells his de&s;pair; the crim&s;on ro&s;e, the
<PB N="80" REF="83">
con&s;enting blu&s;hes of his beloved; and
the cha&s;te lily, the con&s;ummation of his
amatory hopes. Nor do the Canadians,
with a conci&s;e rudene&s;s, experience per|haps
inferior delight, when they &s;end a
lighted match to their mi&s;tre&s;s, and if
&s;he blows it, they are happy. But pre|cipitated
love lo&s;es half it's plea&s;ures.
Sweet and romantic is the varied interval
between de&s;ire and enjoyment. The de|light
of the chace is not in it's game, but
it's pur&s;uit. Let a ba&s;hful mi&s;tre&s;s be
capricious, be cruel, be every thing; but
let her at length be kind. We claim but
the reward of indu&s;try, a holiday in the
toiling year of &s;lavery</P>
<P>"If we li&s;ten to Nature, can we err?
"To enjoy is to obey," declares your
own poet of rea&s;on. And what is the
arid uniformity of life, but a dull and
unmeaning pa&s;&s;age, unle&s;s &s;ome tran&s;ient
ro&s;es are &s;cattered at our feet? Our ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="81" REF="84">
is derived from our &s;en&s;es; corpo|real
&s;en&s;ibility is the &s;ource of our pa&s;|&s;ions,
the motive of our thought, the
magnet of our &s;ociability; and, in one
word, it is our mi&s;ery or our enjoyment.
Nature never relinqui&s;hes our heart; it's
emotions cu&s;tom may pervert, and rea|&s;on
may condemn. But to the tremb|lingly
alive how tedious is cu&s;tom! how
di&s;mal is rea&s;on! Ah! rea&s;on, Mi&s;s
Emily, what is rea&s;on? nothing but a
prevailing &s;y&s;tem of opinions, which in
time are mutilated and rever&s;ed, and
which, directed merely by accidental cu&s;|toms,
is various in every people. Rea|&s;on
is compelled to elaborate with ter|rible
pangs, &s;y&s;tem upon &s;y&s;tem, and de|&s;troys
it&s;elf, in it's attempts of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation;
and when a man is devoid of
&s;en&s;ibility, he is con&s;idered to be the
able&s;t dialectician. Now, if &s;en&s;ibility is
but the &s;oft workings of nature, mark
<PB N="82" REF="85">
how unnatural is rea&s;on! But plea&s;ure,
that is, &s;en&s;ibility gratified, is the &s;ponta|neous
effu&s;ion of nature; it's language is
univer&s;al, it's actions are uniform; the
&s;ame at the burning line as on the icy
Alps. Our &s;en&s;es are the porches of na|ture,
ever open to all our plea&s;ures; rea|&s;on
magi&s;terially would clo&s;e them; but
the&s;e veins are the canals of delight, and
would you freeze them? Rea&s;on may
make a conque&s;t, but Plea&s;ure alone can
be loved, for &s;he is the enchanting and
the native &s;overeign of the heart."</P>
<P>To this &s;ubtile and tedious philo&s;o|phy
Emily patiently li&s;tened, and then
replied. "Alas! Sir, why do you em|ploy
your talents in a cau&s;e &s;o feeble,
and yet &s;o dangerous? All that you have
beautifully &s;aid cannot conceal the di&s;|gu&s;ting
reality; it is only &s;preading the
variegated hues of the rainbow on the
filthy webs of &s;piders. I an&s;wer you,
<PB N="83" REF="86">
however, that rea&s;on, melancholy as you
term it, is my plea&s;ure. I therefore agree
with you, that I &s;hould loath exi&s;tence,
did not indulge my plea&s;ure. Rea&s;on
is immutable, for it is truth. I acknow|ledge
that there exi&s;ts a fal&s;e, as well as
a true rea&s;on; as there is a plea&s;ure that
is true, and another which is fal&s;e. It is
therefore not difficult to de&s;cribe the one,
while we are only alluding to the other;
and, perhaps, had I not been rather &s;in|gular
in my habits of life, and my ta&s;te
for reading, I might have been deluded
in li&s;tening to you; I might have mi&s;tak|en
a fal&s;e and &s;purious plea&s;ure, for that
which alone is true and durable. Con&s;ider,
therefore, the wickedne&s;s of propagating
maxims which all may li&s;ten to with
plea&s;ure, while few can di&s;criminate with
judgment."</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Emily, it is you who
form &s;ophi&s;ms. Why will you call rea|&s;on
<PB N="84" REF="87">
plea&s;ure, and it's variance, immuta|bility?
Is that plea&s;ure, that commands
an ab&s;tinence from enjoyment, and which
is frequently known to communicate an
antipathy of exi&s;tence? No, not all the
propo&s;itions of Locke can change one
organ that inebriates the heart. And is
this rea&s;on immutable, which is variable
as the heavens, and as changeable in a
people as in an individual? When rea|&s;on
flies to the cloi&s;ter, does plea&s;ure fol|low?
When the anchorite &s;huts up the
human heart, what remains but the wan|ing
&s;pectre of man? Pure and trace|le&s;s
is the pliability of plea&s;ure, pure and
tracele&s;s as this ki&s;s!" He took her hand,
and rai&s;ed it to his inclining lips. It was
done with &s;uch mode&s;ty and gentlene&s;s,
that Emily could not be angry; &s;he was
only confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sedley," &s;he &s;aid, "I know
the&s;e freedoms are con&s;idered rather as
<PB N="85" REF="88">
favours done to us; but allow me to in|dulge
my own &s;en&s;ations. I have lived

&s;ure, be &s;atisfied with that poor gratifica|tion
of &s;eizing from an unprotected fe|male
that which &s;he mu&s;t not refu&s;e, and
will not grant."</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid, my charming Mi&s;s
Emily, angel as you are, in mind as in

it is a dividual enjoyment; if you

of life, to that enchantment which
gives to one day the exi&s;tence of an
age, the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of mutual po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion.
But recollect, that with the indul|gence
of this cha&s;te voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, no
virtue refu&s;es to be united; and &s;uch

<P>When the philo&s;ophic voluptuary quit|ted
Emily, he placed his poem in a book
&s;he had been reading, unperceived by
her, and &s;he now retired to dre&s;s. Mrs.
Bully &s;oon afterwards entered, and her
<PB N="87" REF="90">
curious and inqui&s;itorial eye, always ex|erci&s;ed
on the appearance of a volume,
unfortunately di&s;covered in Emily's this

<P>LOVE, in it's earlie&s;t &s;tage, has a
variety of ways of exhibiting it&s;elf.
There is love at fir&s;t &s;ight, which we ob|&s;erve
to be a very fa&s;hionable and expe|ditious
manner with &s;ome of our living
noveli&s;ts; yet I cannot applaud them for
any invention in this re&s;pect. To detect
the fine&s;t foldings of the human heart, is
the plea&s;ing &s;kill of us dome&s;tic biogra|phers.
Then, there is love without love,
by which we under&s;tand the Platonic af|fection;
but what a ridiculous figure
would the amiable boy make, if he were
to hold in his hand an u&s;ele&s;s torch with|out
<PB N="90" REF="93">
a flame, which, we are inclined to
think, is the chimerical flambeau which
every Platoni&s;t waves. But the mo&s;t re|markable,
and, we conceive, the mo&s;t in|genious
kind of love, is when we are per|fectly
enamoured of a per&s;on, whom we
have never &s;een, and of whom we have
never heard. It is a kind of love to
which we are extremely partial, having
our&s;elves formed a hundred delightful
mi&s;eries of &s;uch deliciou&s;ne&s;s; plea&s;ures
of which, a&s;&s;uredly, only exqui&s;ite ge|nius,
or exqui&s;ite madne&s;s, has ever felt
the inebriation. A Spani&s;h hero, in one

his mo&s;t fervent, but mo&s;t &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion,
ob&s;erves, that he loved his mi&s;tre&s;s before

the latter &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a brilliant enqui|page,
a noble man&s;ion, and a noble income;
and in that predicament, the hero may
ju&s;tly attribute his triumph entirely to
him&s;elf. But of the kind of love which
we form for a per&s;on quite unknown to
us, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing in&s;tance is that of
the once famous Zayde, who by the
means of an unknown portrait, hung in
her father's gallery, felt a mo&s;t vehe|ment
pa&s;&s;ion for her lover, about twenty
years before ever &s;he &s;aw him; &s;o that,
without any violation of decency, &s;he
might have thrown her&s;elf into his arms
at the very fir&s;t moment they met; but,
unfortunately, when &s;he met the man &s;he
&s;o ardently loved, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years
in his &s;ociety, which a re&s;olution not to
love him, becau&s;e &s;he loved his picture,
which it is evident was not nece&s;&s;ary for
her to know was his picture, till the la&s;t

<P><PB N="92" REF="95">
Among this cla&s;s of lovers by anticipa|tion,
we mu&s;t place our good Charles;
for he was fond of Emily, and his heart
palpitated warmly at the &s;ound of her
name, long before their fir&s;t accidental
interview at Mrs. Wil&s;on's; he loved
without having &s;een her; for he loved
her mo&s;t affectionately for her filial piety,
and her patient &s;ufferings; but when he
&s;aw her, to love is but a poverty of con|ception,
to de&s;ignate with preci&s;ion the
tumult that ru&s;hed on his heart, that
made him inactive in the day, and re&s;tle&s;s
in the night. With Emily, the grand
affair of love was far different; as &s;he had
not any equal impul&s;es to love Charles
before &s;he &s;aw him, when &s;he did &s;ee him
the pa&s;&s;ion grew by &s;low gradations; &s;he
was aver&s;e to indulge the &s;u&s;ceptibility
of her heart; &s;he had a latent propen|&s;ity
to a dangerous infection, rather than
that &s;he felt the immedicable di&s;order.
<PB N="93" REF="96">
To gain the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her virtuous
heart, it was nece&s;&s;ary to merit it; and
as &s;uch opportunities do not ea&s;ily occur,
(at lea&s;t in true hi&s;tories like the pre&s;ent)
it was long before &s;he perceived the ju&s;t
claim of Charles to that valued gift.
And when &s;he began to love, mo&s;t unfor|tunately
it occurred, that &s;he was obliged
to dread, and to hate, as we purpo&s;e
&s;hortly to detail.</P>
<P>Emily entered the parlour one day,
followed by the Reverend Ephraim Dan|delion.
She flung open the door with a
ha&s;ty violence, unu&s;ual with her mild
manners; her face was one blu&s;h; her
whole frame one di&s;order. "Heavens!
what is the matter, child?" enquired
Mi&s;s Million. "Nothing, Madam;" re|plied
the confu&s;ed Emily, "but Mr.
Dandelion, I pre&s;ume, will be taught to
re&s;pect him&s;elf, or me, for the future. As
it a&s;&s;uredly will not be repeated, it would
<PB N="94" REF="97">
be giving it too much importance to re|member
it."</P>
<P>"Well, but what was it Emily? I
dare &s;ay &s;ome country joke of our young
bi&s;hop."</P>
<P>Dandelion replied: "Mi&s;s Emily is &s;o
touchy, that &s;he takes fire as ea&s;ily as the
wadding of my gun, or as a little field
of furze. What the deuce can a man do
with his hands more inoffen&s;ively, than to
arrange the tucker of a charming girl?
True, my hand &s;lipped; and Mi&s;s Emily
was in &s;uch an agitation, that, d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e,
&s;he frightened me."</P>
<P>The eyes of Charles darted fire; they
were fixed on Dandelion. The Reverend
Ephraim mo&s;t probably caught them, for
he bent his head, and employed him&s;elf
in pulling the &s;traps of his boots. Emily
marked the full direction of Charles's fer|vid
eyes; &s;he felt an emotion of gratitude
and alarm.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98">
"Indeed, is that all?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Mil|lion,
bridling, with a look which &s;he di|vided
between the plaintiff and the de|fendant,
but which might be di&s;crimi|nated,
by an analyzer of a look, into an
in&s;ulting &s;neer for Emily, and a jealous
reproach for Ephraim. "I advi&s;e you,
child, that if &s;uch harmle&s;s freedoms are
to occa&s;ion &s;uch violent re&s;entments, to
hide your&s;elf from the figure of a man.
But you have &s;een &s;o little of the great
world, that &s;uch <HI>gauchet&eacute;</HI> of manners
mu&s;t be the con&s;equence. But I do not
&s;ee, Mr. Dandelion, what you have to do
with Mi&s;s Emily!"</P>
<P>"Mr. Dandelion," ob&s;erved Vaurien,
"would do well, when he thru&s;ts his
hands into a ro&s;e-bu&s;h, to take care of
not &s;cratching him&s;elf with the briers.
I wi&s;h, my good friend, the tucker had
been well armed at all points. You have
had but a bloodle&s;s victory, and have
<PB N="96" REF="99">
taken the outworks without even the apo|logy
of a &s;iege."</P>
<P>"You country gentlemen," &s;aid Sedley,
"are mo&s;t robu&s;t in your refinements;
you cru&s;h in your embrace, and your rap|tures
annihilate delicate nerves. 'Tis all
bu&s;&s;ing at a go&s;&s;ip's chri&s;tening. I think
you are the only re&s;pectable part of the com|munity
who perpetuate the venerable ki&s;&s;ing
of Queen Be&s;&s;e's days, or her good father,
who&s;e ki&s;&s;es, I think, generally concluded
with blows. I believe a woman conceives
a ki&s;s from a country gentleman full as
dreadful as a tug or a &s;hake. You are all
for overflowing bumpers; no matter what
wine! You have done, in the turning of
a lock, what a &s;en&s;itive man would have
taken three years about."</P>
<P>"D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e," &s;aid Dandelion, "you all
&s;et me, like a pack in full cry. I am &s;ure
I am &s;orry to have offended Mi&s;s Emily;
but I never yet offended by a little play."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="100">
"Play, Sir," continued Sedley, "why
it is coming to blows! I fear Mi&s;s Emily
has received &s;ome marks from your cud|gelling
arms. I know a friend, Mr. Dan|delion,
who is a man of &s;en&s;ibility and re|finement,
and who has now paid his de|voirs,
to an amiable woman, the&s;e twelve
years; he never pa&s;&s;ed an evening with her
but in the company of a third per&s;on; he
admires her mu&s;ick, &s;he admires his ver&s;es.
He was &s;even years before he ki&s;&s;ed her
hand; but to have touched her tucker&mdash;Sir, as &s;oon would he;&mdash;but I'll &s;ay no
more."</P>
<P>When the company broke up, Charles
took Dandelion a&s;ide, and &s;aid: "Mi&s;s
Emily Balfour I am &s;orry to &s;ee in this
hou&s;e, without a protector. Such, I ima|gine,
&s;he cannot want long; but, till
&s;he has a protector, we &s;hould all of us
con&s;ider it as our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to
perform that office. You, however, do not.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101">
If you would con&s;ult your own ea&s;e, I
mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that you never offer to give
pain to that Lady, by a &s;ingle word, or a
&s;ingle action."</P>
<P>"So ho, young &s;quire!" whi&s;tled
Dandelion, "<HI>you</HI> are the protector of
Mi&s;s Emily! Who gave you this
right?"</P>
<P>"My humanity. I do not mean to in|terchange
any conver&s;ation. To a per&s;on
of your character conviction mu&s;t be
brought by other means. Mr. Dandelion,
my father was a clergyman; it is an awful
profe&s;&s;ion; and he who &s;eems a&s;hamed of
it, has attained a degree of depravity
which I think is quite of a recent date."
So &s;aying, he gave a violent &s;hake to his
cropt hair and braided tail; for when
our young par&s;on was in town, his cle|rical
encircling curl was twi&s;ted into an
elegant tail, &s;u&s;tained by a tortoi&s;e&s;hell
comb.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">
"And pray, Sir," calmly demanded
Dandelion, "what can you mean by
this?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps you may under&s;tand me bet|ter
now," &s;aid Charles, repeating the ac|tion,
to the utter di&s;comfiture of his
fa&s;hionable crop, while the braided tail
hung di&s;hevelled on his back.</P>
<P>"I believe you mean to in&s;ult me!"</P>
<P>"Preci&s;ely &s;o. I have now only in|&s;ulted
you; but, mean as you are, the
next time you do not e&s;cape correction."</P>
<P>While this &s;hort dialogue was pa&s;&s;ing
between Charles and Ephraim, the door
had been left a-jar, and the maid of Emi|ly,
in pa&s;&s;ing, had been attracted by the
firm tones of Charles. The whole &s;cene
was revealed. Through the magnifying
gla&s;s of her eye &s;he examined every mo|tion,
and, in a very poetical amplification
of our hero's conci&s;e pro&s;e, &s;he detailed
the whole to Emily; who, when the ter|rible
<PB N="100" REF="103">
de&s;cription was clo&s;ed, rejoiced to
find that the duel was a bloodle&s;s en|counter.
Charmed by the mode&s;t, the
&s;en&s;ible, and concealed manner, which
Charles had cho&s;en to protect her, this
action was repaid, by her little heart, with
more than gratitude.</P>
<P>In this manner Emily pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix months
in the hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Million, much to
her di&s;&s;atisfaction. The refinement of
Sedley was in&s;idious; the brutality of
Dandelion di&s;gu&s;ted; the intere&s;t &s;he
took in Vaurien was cen&s;urable; and the
growing affection &s;he felt for Charles was
imprudent. Mi&s;s Million had now heard
her &s;o frequently applauded by every one,
and particularly &s;ince the attack of the
Reverend Ephraim on the fair bo&s;om of
our heroine, that &s;he began to feel weary
of a girl who carried the whole weight of
attention to her &s;ide. Her di&s;plea&s;ure
gleamed through &s;everal ob&s;cure hints
<PB N="101" REF="104">
dropped to Mrs. Betty her waiting-maid,
who blew the gleams into a kitchen flame.
They met a mo&s;t terrible bellows in the
mouth of Mrs. Bully, who, be&s;ides accu|&s;ations
of Sociniani&s;m, whi&s;pered in clo&s;e
&s;ecrets, and talked in imperfect &s;urmi&s;es,
that &s;he had made a mo&s;t important de|tection
of the loo&s;e morals of Mi&s;s Emily.
This part of her accu&s;ation agitated the cu|rio&s;ity
of the lower part of the hou&s;e; and
a mo&s;t unfortunate circum&s;tance, which
then happened, confirmed all the foul ac|cu&s;ations
of the orthodox and benevolent
Mrs. Bully.</P>
<P>Emily now viewed the altered features
of patronage; &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf the de|pendant
of a mean, an unfeeling, and an
uneducated woman of fa&s;hion. To her
&s;en&s;ations every look was reproach, every
expre&s;&s;ion contempt, and every civility
in&s;ult. Not that Mi&s;s Million uttered
her vulgar &s;entiments in their clear and
<PB N="102" REF="105">
appropriate language; but, to the lumi|nous
&s;en&s;ibility of Emily, the &s;ordid heart
of Mi&s;s Million lay open; and her &s;en&s;i|tive
&s;oul now &s;hivered, in all the varying
&s;ea&s;ons of a year of patronage. It was
now &s;he perceived that &s;he had not re|garded
the coun&s;el of her father, in &s;eek|ing
her independence from her&s;elf; &s;he
&s;aw her exi&s;tence in &s;orrow or in plea&s;ure,
as the face of her patrone&s;s cho&s;e. Com|pletely
mi&s;erable, and humiliated in her
own mind, &s;he felt her&s;elf unprotected,
and knew not wher to find a refuge.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vaurien's Friend&s;hips.</HEAD>
<P>THE friend&s;hip of Charles for Vau|rien
had become indi&s;&s;oluble. Some
opinions, which the Gaul had at fir&s;t
thrown out, alarmed him; but he con&s;i|dered
them only as tho&s;e dangerous para|doxes,
peculiar to the intemperate philo|&s;ophers
of his country; nor was Charles
a little delighted, by perceiving the energy
of his own eloquence, operating on the
&s;uperior intellect of Vaurien, who had
gradually relinqui&s;hed his own notions,
one by one, and, at pre&s;ent, &s;eemed only
a mere reflection of the pure and hone&s;t
Charles. He repo&s;ed on the bo&s;om of this
cheri&s;hed friend; his virtues daily excited
<PB N="104" REF="107">
admiration; and none &s;o much as his ex|traordinary
liberalities, &s;ince his late remit|tances
from France, which, as he informed
his friends, he had been &s;o fortunate as to
receive. To Vaurien, Charles poured his &s;e|cret
&s;orrows; he touched mournfully on the
di&s;&s;ipations of Lady Belfield, and lamented
the contempt he hourly received from his
former gentle patrone&s;s. "As for my Lord,
you acknowledge," &s;aid he, "that he is ob|&s;tinately
lo&s;t to rea&s;on, and an enemy to
that con&s;titution which protects his per&s;on
and his property; which mu&s;t be &s;lowly
reformed, not rapidly de&s;troyed; united
clo&s;er, not di&s;organi&s;ed. In vain I wil|lingly
yield &s;ome principles, which I deem
political &s;uper&s;titions; but, in return, he
yields me not one opinion, however fan|ta&s;tic,
however de&s;tructive. He and his
party would innovate all things; but my
Lord does not agree with Mr. Subtile,
Mr. Subtile with Mr. Dragon, nor Mr.
<PB N="105" REF="108">
Sympathy with Dr. Bounce. Philo&s;ophy
has it's prejudices, not le&s;s pernicious, not
le&s;s inhuman, than the popular prejudices
of the mo&s;t intolerant people. And at
what aims this philo&s;ophy? In forming a
man without a heart! It is of no con&s;e|quence
to me, whether a per&s;ecuting re|ligion
burns me in an auto-da-fe, or whe|ther
a per&s;ecuting philo&s;ophy conducts
me to the guillotine; it is always the
&s;ame thing for my neck."</P>
<P>To &s;imilar conver&s;ations Vaurien had
not only given his approbation, but ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his &s;urpri&s;e that a free Briton,
like Charles, &s;hould violate his dignity by
the dependence of patronage. "Grati|tude,"
&s;aid he, "for the reception ac|corded
to a foreign wanderer, &s;till kept
him in the hou&s;e of Belfield, but his day
of enfranchi&s;ement &s;hould not be far;
and he &s;hould rejoice to ob&s;erve Charles
&s;purn his &s;plendid, but ignoble chains;"
<PB N="106" REF="109">
and for this purpo&s;e offered a liberal &s;up|ply
of money. Charles felt grateful, and
only refu&s;ed the offer through delicacy,
ob&s;erving, "that whenever his patrons
&s;hould hint at a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he would re|joice
to accept it." "Tres bien," &s;aid
Vaurien, mu&s;ing.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield was exa&s;perated by the
in&s;en&s;ibility of Charles; &s;he had exhau&s;t|ed
her whole artillery, and &s;he in vain
e&s;&s;ayed to &s;often the human &s;tatue into
animation. She now &s;u&s;pected that his
heart was occupied by &s;ome rival. To her
confidential Vaurien &s;he opened her &s;ur|mi&s;es;
their mutual pa&s;&s;ion had greatly
&s;ub&s;ided, and, it it's height, it was a love
that knows no jealou&s;y. Her Lady&s;hip
and Vaurien would have mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted
each other in procuring them&s;elves new
lovers.</P>
<P>"Indeed," replied Vaurien to the en|quiry,
"it is an in&s;ult to your Lady&s;hip.
<PB N="107" REF="110">
Shall I dare to &s;ay, you have a rival, in
an abject being?"</P>
<P>"I de&s;ire, Vaurien," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip,
reddening, "that you will inform me."</P>
<P>"I cannot; my indignation would pre|&s;erve
&s;ilence."</P>
<P>"Sen&s;itive Vaurien! You anticipate
my feelings. I in&s;i&s;t on knowing."</P>
<P>"He is my friend; you mu&s;t grant
me the mo&s;t inviolable &s;ecre&s;y. Charles
is unworthy of your regard. Your ri|val,"
added Vaurien, with a &s;neer half|&s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
"is a low woman, picked
from the &s;treets, and whom he has placed
in a petty &s;hop." He gave the addre&s;s of
Mrs. Wil&s;on.</P>
<P>The face of Lady Belfield burned;
her eyes caught fire; and &s;he &s;aid, &s;carce
audibly: "Is the wretch &s;o low? How
humiliating the villain! His pre&s;ence is
a reproach. Vaurien, he &s;hall not remain
here."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">
"At this hou&s;e," continued Vaurien,
"Mi&s;s Balfour accidentally hired lodg|ings.
He has taken me frequently to
this woman's; but the &s;weet Emily, for
whom you know I feel a pa&s;&s;ion, a pa&s;|&s;ion
as yet ungratified, knows nothing of
her character."</P>
<P>"I have told you, Vaurien," replied
her Lady&s;hip, "that I have already &s;e|cured
that dear girl to re&s;ide with us
&s;ome time. Receive that innocence with
gentlene&s;s; &s;mile at lea&s;t on the victim
of my friend&s;hip and your love. When
&s;he bleeds, let me not hear her cries."</P>
<P>From this conver&s;ation Vaurien ha&s;|tened
to his Lord&s;hip. With Belfield
he had for &s;ome time pa&s;t engaged in
complicate con&s;piracies. "This morn|ing,
my Lord," he &s;aid, "a tru&s;ty cou|rier
has brought me letters from Bre&s;t.
Rowan O'Connor has &s;ecured Connaught.
We have a garri&s;on of Defenders in all

are playing gently now with the
Moder&eacute;s, but, rely on it, 'tis the young
tyger with his keeper, who attempted to
dome&s;ticate the animal, but when the
tyger knew his &s;trength, he to&s;&s;ed about
the head of his keeper for his amu&s;ement.
An embarkation for England is prepar|ing,
the coa&s;ts are lined with men; the
inva&s;ion is at no great di&s;tance; but your
Lord&s;hip wants patrioti&s;m, and this is the
only moment when all the Thames &s;hould
roll, like another Pactolus, on &s;ands of
gold. Money is wanted in Ireland. Dra|gon
holds a corre&s;pondence with almo&s;t
every town in England; we have all the
idle, the di&s;contented, the bankrupts, and
the hot-brained youth of every town;
you &s;ee our party is formidable. Rant

among the lower cla&s;&s;es than all the
money of your Lord&s;hip; he is quite
intelligible to them; ranting, roaring,
raving; he draws his metaphors from
the very gutters of the people; and &s;o
far, like Virgil, as your Addi&s;on &s;ays,
the fellow to&s;&s;es his dung about him
with &s;ome effect."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip li&s;tened with inten&s;e de|light
to this rapid &s;ketch of the Gaul.
What he barely touched on, his fertile
imagination expanded by anticipation.
Already, on the ruins of London, a com|mittee
of public &s;afety &s;eemed to ari&s;e.
"Take all, my dear Vaurien, all I have
to give; but the dilatorine&s;s of all tho&s;e
projects, which you de&s;cribe &s;o rapidly,
has left me a ruined man. Mortgage
I cannot more, and for &s;windling I have
not &s;ufficient credit. If this inva&s;ion of
England fails, where &s;hall I fly?"</P>
<P>"France," replied Vaurien, "will be
proud to enrol the name of Belfield
<PB N="111" REF="114">
among it's Engli&s;h citizens; we have al|ready
&s;ome Briti&s;h worthies of a kindred
merit. But I can proceed no further if
Charles remains in your hou&s;e. I &s;u&s;pect
he is a mini&s;terial &s;py."</P>
<P>"He &s;hall have his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion," &s;aid
his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Such were the friend&s;hips of Vaurien;
yet at the very in&s;tant he evinced a &s;ud|den
ebullition of &s;ympathy, which virtue
would have been proud to own. Pa&s;|&s;ing
the hall, he ob&s;erved a &s;ervant lad,
who had retired into a dark corner, and
&s;eated on a bench, was weeping and &s;ob|bing.
"What has happened, William?"
enquired Vaurien.&mdash;"I have ju&s;t re|ceived
a letter, Sir, from my poor mo|ther,
who tells me my father is dead.
He has been bed-ridden the&s;e ten years.
His death might have been borne, for
my poor mother could hardly &s;upport
her&s;elf and a helple&s;s old man. But we
are both now in &s;uch de&s;pair, I cannot

&s;leep at the thoughts; my father will
not have Chri&s;tian burial; the creditors
in&s;i&s;t fir&s;t on being paid; the body is
detained, and heaven only knows where
my father's &s;oul re&s;ts; it can never re&s;t
&s;urely if not buried in Chri&s;tian ground.
Ah! Sir, I remember, that when the
great Methodi&s;t Surgeon of our village
anatomized the &s;trong man that was
hanged for continually breaking out of
pri&s;on, he felt a qualm of con&s;cience,
and employed me in the night to dig
a grave in the church-yard, that the
bones might be buried in holy ground;
for he, no doubt, could not an&s;wer to his
con&s;cience if they had remained unburied.
If people are not buried in church ground,
what will become of their &s;ouls? My
mother is di&s;tracted, and I am afraid to
walk in the night." Vaurien &s;miled at
the artle&s;s tremors of the lad and his
mother, and quieted their holy horror
by his liberal a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

of a che&s;t of tea, was equally oppre&s;&s;ed as
blinded, yet unfortunately determined, at
the &s;ame time, to be rapid in his motions;
&s;o that the exertion of &s;ight entirely re&s;ted
on the pa&s;&s;engers, and not on the porter.
The latter indeed proceeded rapidly, but
&s;ecurely, for he was in no danger of be|ing
rever&s;ed; but ru&s;hing round the cor|ner
of a &s;treet where Mrs. Wil&s;on had
arrived, at that very nicety of point of
turning when the two future contenders
are perfectly unperceived by each other&mdash;in not half a &s;econd of time&mdash;the por|ter
rounded, and Mrs. Wil&s;on fell! It
proved no trifling fracture, and &s;he had
<PB N="115" REF="118">
hitherto been confined to her hou&s;e.
Emily had more than once called on her,
had &s;ympathized, and found her more
e&s;timable at every interview; yet her fa|ther's
&s;u&s;picions had made in indelible
impre&s;&s;ion on her mind; and prompt as
&s;he was at the tender call of friend&s;hip,
&s;u&s;picion made her rather tremble than
enjoy.</P>
<P>When this poor woman found her&s;elf
in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence, &s;he came im|mediately
to her young friend. "I hope,
Mi&s;s Emily," &s;he &s;aid, "your &s;ituation
is agreeable."</P>
<P>"Alas! Mrs. Wil&s;on," Emily replied,
"if it is not, I mu&s;t attribute it to my
pre&s;ent &s;tate of feeling. Every &s;cene
takes much, and &s;ometimes all it's effect,
from our exi&s;ting ideas. I feel, that if
I were in an Ely&s;ium it would appear
gloomy. In the image of my father,
there is yet too much life for me quietly
<PB N="116" REF="119">
to remember that it has cea&s;ed to exi&s;t,
his minute&s;t habits, and his accu&s;tomed
phra&s;es, &s;till engage my affections; and
I gaze, on what I cannot view, and I
li&s;ten, to what I cannot hear. To me he
is not dead! and I &s;eem to live in the
cruel torments of an ab&s;ence I never yet
knew, and cannot teach my&s;elf to &s;uffer.
Con&s;ider, then, my pre&s;ent &s;ituation;
here is nothing but mirth and &s;plendour,
and my heart is agitated by a perpetual
conflict of interiour mi&s;ery, and exterior
gaiety. But with me the heart will ever
prevail over all it's con&s;traints; it will
colour the &s;cene I view, will prompt in my
&s;orrows the languor of my conver&s;ation,
and mu&s;t ill fit me to be the companion of
Mi&s;s Million. Every day I feel I am an
intruder in this great hou&s;e; and yet I
con&s;ider my&s;elf as it's humble&s;t &s;ervant.
I &s;old my freedom when I united my&s;elf
to it's generous owner. Gratitude takes
<PB N="117" REF="120">
from me the power of choice; otherwi&s;e,
much could I wi&s;h, my dear Mrs. Wil|&s;on,
that I &s;till occupied the &s;mall room
of your &s;mall hou&s;e; there I think I
could feel quietne&s;s, and to me quietne&s;s
&s;eems an enjoyment; I almo&s;t think it
felicity. My independence would then
ari&s;e from my&s;elf; temperance would be
my gratification; u&s;eful, yet not un|plea&s;ing
occupations all my wealth, and
your conver&s;ation would con&s;titute all
that I wi&s;h to hear of the world. When
I entered this &s;uperb man&s;ion, I unthink|ingly
violated the &s;olemn injunction of my
dear father, who, as if he had been aware
of this &s;plendid &s;lavery, this &s;ilken chain,
told me only to derive my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
from my&s;elf. Ah! if I were but once
more in your little room!&mdash;but what do
I &s;ay? There my father would &s;it before
me; every thing in your hou&s;e would
remind me of his pre&s;ence. The arm
<PB N="118" REF="121">
chair would tell me where he twice
&s;wooned, and the bed would for ever
revive his la&s;t, his affectionate, yet dig|nified
hour! But the&s;e are fooli&s;h tears;
the unavailing tears of memory; yet is
their &s;weet &s;adne&s;s endeared to the liv|ing;
they ever relieve me; and when I
have wiped my eyes, my heart feels the
energy of fortitude, and I then &s;ay, I live
as Heaven chu&s;es."</P>
<P>"If you would live with me," replied
Mrs. Wil&s;on, "I will change my hou&s;e.
On indu&s;try alone depends all my bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and indu&s;try will make bu&s;ine&s;s
in one &s;treet as well as in another. I
have heard &s;ome of my neighbours, who
have quitted their fir&s;t &s;hops to get into
larger ones, complain, that their pre&s;ent
&s;treet is not half &s;o <HI>lucky</HI> as their former
one. I have attempted, out of mere be|nevolence,
and not of mere pride, to play
the philo&s;opher. I have &s;hewn them,
<PB N="119" REF="122">
that in their fir&s;t &s;hops, with much le&s;s
bu&s;ine&s;s, they were much more indu&s;tri|ous;
and that when &s;ome people get rich,
it is a chance, that they become again
poor; and really, without &s;u&s;pecting it,
I have pur&s;ued a certain notion of Ari|&s;totle's,
which I met the other evening,
that there is no good or ill fortune, but
what ari&s;es from our own ill or good
conduct; and that to &s;ay a man is very
unfortunate, is to &s;ay, that he wants ca|pacity,
or wants indu&s;try. However, I
have made no converts of my good neigh|bours;
and one particularly, who, I fear,
by his expen&s;ive mode of living, and by
the affected education of his daughters,
who, when their father's man is weighing
chee&s;e, are employed at delighting his
ears by jarring with a concerto of Haydn,
and who have hung round their &s;hop,
among Che&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire chee&s;es,
&s;ome &s;elect views of ancient Greece, I &s;ay
<PB N="120" REF="123">
this poor man, who made a re&s;pectable
fortune in his fir&s;t &s;hop by his own in|du&s;try,
is now convinced, that Great
Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet is one of the unluckie&s;t
&s;treets in town. But I am flying off in
a tangent when I have &s;omething to
communicate, of a &s;erious and intere&s;ting
nature.</P>
<P>"What I now impart mu&s;t, my dear
Mi&s;s Emily, be confided to your &s;ecret ear.
It is not only your delicacy which I fear
to irritate, but the kindne&s;s of the hu|mane&s;t
man, which I tremble to offend.
A devoted friend&s;hip for two per&s;ons,
who&s;e happine&s;s is dear to me as the ex|i&s;tence
of my children, will, if it is re|turned
but in the &s;malle&s;t portion, re|ceive
with affection, or pardon with fa|cility,
what my heart has prompted me
to di&s;clo&s;e."</P>
<P>"Why this embarra&s;&s;ment, Mrs. Wil|&s;on?
What &s;ecret can you have to pre|face
<PB N="121" REF="124">
thus &s;olemnly? Can you fear to
unfold, or I to hear, what you &s;ay in|tere&s;ts
me? The innocent have no &s;e|crets.
I a&s;&s;ure you I never had a &s;ecret
in my life. I have indeed been made ac|quainted
with that kind of intelligence,
but I generally found that a &s;ecret was
only malice in di&s;gui&s;e. I mu&s;t freely
&s;ay, that extorted &s;ilence I can violate
without any con&s;cientious yearnings.
Have you a &s;ecret which you would not
tell me as frankly as any other friend?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I cannot agree. Yes, I mu&s;t
&s;ay that innocence may have it's &s;ecrets,
which it would expire before it would
reveal. Ah! there are &s;ome delicate &s;itu|ations,
which, if not fearfully and cau|tiou&s;ly
concealed, might wear the mo&s;t
criminal a&s;pect." Mrs. Wil&s;on here gave
a &s;igh much more profound than au|dible.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125">
"Well, my dear Mrs. Wil&s;on," re|plied
Emily, "you mu&s;t know more of
human nature than my&s;elf. I never could
enter into any man's character but my
father's. All men a&s;&s;uredly are not pur|&s;ued
by the &s;ame ill fortune; and all,
therefore, may not be as &s;elf-&s;evere. Of|ten
has he told me, that he never con|ceived
a thought that he was not prompt
to expre&s;s. Excellent man! There was
a holine&s;s in his mind. And re&s;pecting
tho&s;e critical &s;ituations to which you al|lude,
where innocence takes a criminal
a&s;pect, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;incerity is wi&s;|dom.
What to-day we conceal may ap|pear
to-morrow; and the explanation we
avoided will then come too late. We
have got into our u&s;ual moralizing &s;train,
my dear Mrs. Wil&s;on; but I am now
quite prepared for your &s;ecret."</P>
<P>While Emily was pronouncing her
<PB N="123" REF="126">
father's apophthegm on &s;incerity, Mrs.
Wil&s;on reddened, changed her po&s;ture,
and drew out her handkerchief to place
before her eyes. Emily was intent on
her netting. The pointed addre&s;s &s;he had
made, her innocent heart never &s;u&s;pected.
When Mrs. Wil&s;on recovered from cer|tain
uncomfortable &s;en&s;ations, &s;he pro|ceeded
thus: "You know, Mi&s;s Emily,
that to the &s;ingular benevolence of Mr.
Charles Hamilton I and my children are
indebted for our daily bread. We &s;hould
now be wor&s;e than mendicants; for men|dicity
has it's friend&s;hips; alone in this
metropolis, God denied me one. I con|&s;idered
my&s;elf as an outca&s;t; no relative
to aid me with an a&s;&s;ua&s;ive word of con|&s;olation;
poverty was combined with
de&s;pair. My &s;oul &s;ickened, my exi&s;tence
was poignant; more than once my armed
hand was rai&s;ed to my brea&s;t; but when
my eye has &s;ought to take a final fare|well
<PB N="124" REF="127">
of my children, the weapon fell, and
the mother lived!" Here Mrs. Wil&s;on
bur&s;t into tears, and her thick &s;obbings
impeded her voice.</P>
<P>"Dear Mrs. Wil&s;on," &s;aid Emily in
emotion, "I believe your &s;ituation was
as &s;ingular as the benevolence of Mr.
Charles. His mode&s;ty &s;tudiou&s;ly con|ceals
his merits; but no man who is uni|formly
benevolent can &s;o far indulge his
natural di&s;po&s;itions; the voice of grati|tude
will utter the &s;ecrets of mode&s;t
philanthropy. He has felt for me here;
I too am his debtor, but it is unknown
to him; he has &s;een me embarra&s;&s;ed, and
has delicately extricated; he has &s;een me
in&s;ulted, and has &s;ilently protected. It
would have been generous to have pro|tected
a female, but to have done this
unknown to all but to her offender has
in it &s;omething of the delicacy of tho&s;e
&s;en&s;itive beings who, in an age of roman|tic
<PB N="125" REF="128">
genero&s;ity, were only alive to the im|pul&s;e
of heroi&s;m."</P>
<P>Mrs. Wil&s;on was now more compo&s;ed;
and this voluntary applau&s;e be&s;towed on
her friend cheered and animated; a &s;oft
&s;mile brightened her tears, like a &s;un|beam
gilding a watery cloud. She &s;aid,
"perhaps, Mi&s;s Emily, you have ob|&s;erved
Mr. Charles of late. How exa|nimate,
how pallid, how melancholy!"</P>
<P>"He has told me," &s;aid Emily, "he
is unwell."</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied Mrs. Wil&s;on, "he
thinks he never can be well. Sleeple&s;s
nights and feveri&s;h days, if they can|not
rapidly annihilate the &s;ource of life,
pre&s;s down it's ela&s;ticity, and wear away
&s;lowly but &s;urely it's &s;prings. Never ex|pect
more to &s;ee him other than he is;
his malady is in his &s;ilence, and he will
prefer that &s;ilence to his health; he pe|ri&s;hes
without the little con&s;olation of
<PB N="126" REF="129">
&s;aying, I peri&s;h; enamoured of his ma|lady,
he &s;miles in his &s;ufferings."</P>
<P>"Explain your&s;elf," exclaimed Emily,
earne&s;tly and tremblingly.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t fir&s;t," continued Mrs. Wil|&s;on,
"a&s;&s;ure you, that Mr. Charles &s;ome|times,
in the native &s;implicity of his heart,
confides circum&s;tances which he would not
expre&s;sly mention. If my gratitude had
not taught me to &s;tudy him minutely, to
catch every variation of his tones, every
expre&s;&s;ion of his ge&s;tures, every di&s;tant
combination of a ca&s;ual word, I had to
this moment, like others, only perceived
that his health decayed, while the cau&s;e
would have been mantled over in the
mo&s;t re&s;olute concealment. Like you,
Mi&s;s Emily, in his re&s;idence he is unfor|tunate.
You alike feel the tortures of
a &s;plendid dependence. Similar in your
&s;entiments, you are &s;imilar in your &s;uffer|ings.
If you mutually look into your
<PB N="127" REF="130">
own hearts, you will &s;ee that of the
other."</P>
<P>A quick blu&s;h covered the face of
Emily, warm as the fir&s;t &s;uffu&s;ion of an
early pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"And now, Mi&s;s Balfour, when I ven|ture
to &s;ay, that with diffidence, but with
ardour, he loves you, mu&s;t I be cen&s;ured
for unburthening a truth that has long
oppre&s;&s;ed my heart? Who in this world
are dear to me but my children, and
your&s;elf, and Mr. Charles? Re&s;t only
a&s;&s;ured, that he knows not of my coming
here, and &s;u&s;pects not that I have di&s;co|vered
the concealed &s;ource of his infeli|city.
Did I not know him the noble&s;t
of men, I &s;hould not have addre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf
now to the mo&s;t amiable of women.
Gratitude would not have exacted my
di&s;turbance of your repo&s;e. Pardon me
then, if I have acted erroneou&s;ly; it is
the error of re&s;pectful affection."</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131">
Emily pau&s;ed, was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and ra|veled
her net-work. "I know not how
to reply," &s;he &s;aid, "my dear Mrs. Wil|&s;on.
I have the highe&s;t regard for Mr.
Charles. Not to value him would &s;hew
my&s;elf worthle&s;s. I owe him much. He
is the only friend I have of his &s;ex. But
when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I never felt more
than re&s;pect for the ma&s;culine character,
I &s;peak with my wonted &s;incerity. The
pa&s;&s;ion of love has never mole&s;ted my
quiet; I never could love any man but
my father. I loved him becau&s;e he was
great and unfortunate. But the friend|&s;hips
of my own &s;ex form the only &s;o|cial
plea&s;ures I can receive from another.
There is no delicacy, none of the tender
and melting features of nature in man.
If my father had not been my father, even
him I &s;hould have thought &s;evere. As
for my&s;elf, I have found &s;ome relief; La|dy
Belfield has given me an invitation to
<PB N="129" REF="132">
re&s;ide with her during an ab&s;ence of Mi&s;s
Million's from town. Believe me when
I &s;ay, that the friend&s;hip of her Lady|&s;hip,
an amiable and accompli&s;hed wo|man,
yields a carele&s;s, untempered joy,
a fearle&s;s happine&s;s, which the &s;everity
of man can never communicate."</P>
<P>"Name not Lady Belfield!" cried
Mrs. Wil&s;on with energy and emotion.
"I mu&s;t not further prolong my vi&s;it;
but, dear Mi&s;s Emily, remember that
Charles Hamilton will be &s;ilent but mu&s;t
love. I conjure you not to notice to
him, that I have mentioned his name to
you on this delicate di&s;covery. Never,
perhaps, would he pardon, and his di&s;|plea&s;ure
would render the life I owe him
loath&s;ome."</P>
<P>She quitted the fair Emily, and left
her ab&s;orbed in tho&s;e tender trepida|tions
of the mind, when with half-reluctant
half-a&s;&s;enting emotions the
earlie&s;t flame of pa&s;&s;ion breaks from
<PB N="130" REF="133">
the heart, where it lay concealed and un|felt,
to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the form, to
&s;parkle in the eye, to bloom in the fea|ture,
to melodize the voice, and to po|li&s;h
the air; while nature, &s;econding the
innocent embarra&s;&s;ment, bewitches the
lover by calling forth tho&s;e new-born
charms, more fatal to his repo&s;e than
tho&s;e he traced ere his mi&s;tre&s;s knew her
fir&s;t amorous thought.</P>
<P>But the &s;evere fortune of Charles
doomed that this fir&s;t amorous thought
was never known to him, and, in&s;tead
of charming, it terrified. The cradle
of Love is wreathed by the Graces, and
the mu&s;ic of Hope pours its fa&s;cinating
&s;ound; but to our hero, Love was nur&s;ed
by the Furies, and the melodies of Hope
were exchanged for the my&s;terious re|proaches
and the averted face of his
Emily.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Puni&s;hment continued when the Crime
has cea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Wil&s;on had quitted the
faire Emily, and was pa&s;&s;ing through
the hall, one of the footmen familiarly ad|dre&s;&s;ed
her, and was on the point of forc|ing
her to an embrace, when violently
bur&s;ting from his arms, in an agony of
horror &s;he exclaimed: "And has it come
to this?"&mdash;She ru&s;hed from the door.</P>
<P>"Body o'me!" cried the footman,
"why the old dame thinks I don't know
her again. She has gone off for all the
world like a mode&s;t woman! So the Hol|born-hill
madam is Mi&s;s Emily's good
friend! Birds of a feather, I warrant;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">are intelligence for Mrs. Bully!"</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">
Let us follow the mi&s;erable and humi|liated
Wil&s;on! She reached home with|out
a perception of having i&s;&s;ued from the
hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Million. The hall and the
footman were fixed in her imagination;
a repeated ge&s;ture &s;eemed as if &s;he was
continually &s;hrinking from his touch;
&s;he writhed in tortures; her face was now
reddened by the deepe&s;t &s;hame, and &s;oon
&s;ucceeded an a&s;hy horror over every fea|ture.
As &s;oon as &s;he had reached her
hou&s;e &s;he hurried to her chamber, threw
her&s;elf on the bed, and &s;poke incohe|rently
in an agony of &s;pirits: "Father
of Mercies, is mercy alone denied to me?
Is not an error wa&s;hed away by tears like
mine? No! I had not endured thy final
puni&s;hment; I &s;ee there was a degree of
mi&s;ery yet re&s;erved for me, &s;harper than
the &s;ecret &s;ting that lay in my heart.
When I was a pro&s;titute, my &s;hame was
re&s;erved for my&s;elf; there was no friend
<PB N="133" REF="136">
to reproach; no perdition to the cheri&s;hed
feelings of &s;ocial affection; no one marked
me; I &s;inned, no, I only erred, in peace.
Children, children! what have ye not co&s;t
me! what now will ye co&s;t me! Shall I
cur&s;e ye? &s;hall I abandon ye? Have ye
not extended your mother on the &s;lowe&s;t
rack of agony?&mdash;Poor children, ye are
innocent, I alone am guilty. Heaven de|crees
that the puni&s;hment &s;hall endure
when the crime has pa&s;t. Shall I mur|mur
to ta&s;te the bitterne&s;s my own hands
have prepared? Now, wherever I wander,
wherever I fix, 'the finger of &s;corn' will
point at me, a low, a mi&s;erable pro&s;titute!
A fever &s;hakes my frame. Cruel retro|&s;pection!
I thought my&s;elf rein&s;tated in
virtue and comfort&mdash;one &s;troke of acci|dent
de&s;troys my eternal peace! This
footman&mdash;The idea is in&s;upportable!&mdash;my &s;hame is promulgated&mdash;Mi&s;s Emily
mu&s;t at length know me the wretch I am
<PB N="134" REF="137">
Wi&s;e was her father's coun&s;el, that &s;in|cerity
is wi&s;dom; what we conceal to-day
may appear to-morrow. Explanation has
come too late! For the blu&s;h it would
have co&s;t me, I now mu&s;t give the pang
that &s;hall endure with life. She &s;urely
addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me, to claim the elu|cidation
of my my&s;terious hi&s;tory. O tor|ture!
I will fly into the country; I will
&s;eek &s;ome chance &s;ervitude; I will peri&s;h,
and no one &s;hall know where the wretched
Wil&s;on dies.&mdash;This then is the &s;u&s;pended
puni&s;hment of heaven! I ta&s;ted bitter|ne&s;s;
I feed on gall. My children, my
children, if ye peri&s;h, ye cannot reproach
your delirious mother&mdash;it is your country,
your God decrees it."</P>
<P>Leaving this victim of her own error
and of public prejudice we return to the
hou&s;e of Million. As &s;oon as the foot|man,
who had more than once known her
in her degrading character, entered the
<PB N="135" REF="138">
&s;ervants' hall, he informed the coachman,
that the dame of Holborn-hill had ju&s;t
pa&s;&s;ed from the apartment of Emily, and
that &s;he flung out as proud as if &s;he had
been a mode&s;t woman. The coachman
related the circum&s;tance to his very good
friend the cook, without "extenuating
or &s;etting down aught in malice." In
the&s;e ca&s;es the imaginations of men are
not apt to prove &s;o fertile as tho&s;e of the
women, for rea&s;ons known a&s;&s;uredly to
an ob&s;erver of human nature. The cook
embelli&s;hed it, the chamber-maid refined
it, while Mrs. Bully gave it the beginning,
the middle, and the end, &s;o &s;everely ex|acted
by the great Ari&s;totle in the com|po&s;ition
of an epic. And here we mu&s;t
ob&s;erve, that <HI>lying</HI> is the <HI>eloquence</HI> of the
vulgar. To affect and per&s;uade the hu|man
pa&s;&s;ions requires a forcible emotion
of the &s;oul; for a gentle emotion, like the
flat uniformity of a &s;leeping &s;ea, cannot
<PB N="136" REF="139">
plea&s;e long. We mu&s;t &s;torm the mind.
Poets and orators will therefore be&s;t &s;uc|ceed
in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the attention
of their readers and auditors, becau&s;e they
alike are &s;kilful in <HI>amplification,</HI> which, in
truth, is nothing but <HI>lying.</HI> An <HI>exact</HI> re|pre&s;entation
would not affect; we &s;hould
not long read a poem, or li&s;ten to an ora|tion,
which had nothing but the &s;impli|city
of truth. Of this the vulgar are &s;en|&s;ible,
although the cau&s;e is concealed.
There are no greater liars than the vulgar,
for experience has taught them the uti|lity
of lying; they employ augmentatives
or diminutives, as they de&s;ire to excite
a corre&s;pondent feeling; and the vulgar
are, without knowing it, great poets and
orators.</P>
<P>The cook mentioned, that a vile &s;trum|pet,
known to John and Mi&s;s Emily, had
ju&s;t gone out; the chamber-maid, that
Mi&s;s Emily and John were acquainted
<PB N="137" REF="140">
with all the &s;trumpets in town; and Mrs.
Bully hurried to Mr. Million, to a&s;&s;ure
him, that it was now high time to &s;peak
out; that Mi&s;s Emily was only fit com|pany
for women of the town, and was
concerned with John; that &s;he her&s;elf
had &s;een in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion an abominable
book, and was be&s;ides a profe&s;&s;ed Arian.</P>
<P>"Well, well, 'tis ju&s;t what I thought!"
exclaimed Mr. Million. "Taking the
Lord knows who into the hou&s;e of a bank
director, becau&s;e &s;he was an old blind
lieutenant's daughter. I &s;hall have all
the daughters of the old knights of Wind|&s;or.
Cur&s;e her harp, twanging in my ears,
that makes me as melancholy &s;ometimes
as a fall of &s;tocks." He ha&s;tened to
Mi&s;s Million, who certainly was &s;ingularly
&s;hocked with the intelligence, con&s;idering
that &s;he already had heard it from Betty
two hours before, and was then quietly
do&s;ing over the la&s;t new novel.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141">
"My dear father," cried Mi&s;s Million,
"I am all of a tremor; my poor nerves!
'tis &s;hameful! not fit to be told! Pray
call in John, accu&s;e him before me, let
me hear all that has pa&s;t. It will be in
the papers to-morrow; if Mr. Libel &s;hould
hear it, Million-hou&s;e will be &s;candalized.
A footman!"</P>
<P>John being &s;ummoned, related his &s;im|ple
&s;tory; and reduced the epical lye of
Mrs. Bully to a mere a&s;&s;urance, that
the per&s;on who had i&s;&s;ued from Mi&s;s
Emily's apartment was a common pro&s;|titute.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Million being now alone, &s;ent in
for Emily, and began thus: "Mi&s;s, when
I &s;uffered you to make Portman-&s;quare
your a&s;ylum, it was from my benevolence."
Emily trembled. "But you have abu&s;ed
my goodne&s;s, and in&s;tead of the girl you
was at Exmouth, I find you are the a&s;&s;o|ciate
of a low pro&s;titute."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142">
Emily, pale and alarmed, cried, "Hea|vens!
what do you mean? Tell me, I be|&s;eech
you, quickly!"</P>
<P>"Your alarm and your tremor are ex|tremely
adroit. Performed to admiration!
Why, one would think, to look at you,
you really trembled! But 'tis the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of your friend. One might ima|gine
that you did not know who was
the per&s;on who called on you this morn|ing."</P>
<P>"Her name is Wil&s;on; &s;he let lodgings
to my father."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay &s;he lets lodgings. She is
well known in this family; a very <HI>chere
amie</HI> of John's. You will have the kind|ne&s;s
to quit Million-hou&s;e as early as you
can. I need not recommend you a lodg|ing."
So &s;aying, &s;he hummed a tender
opera air, and left Emily in the parlour,
motionle&s;s and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At length &s;en&s;ation revived to con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="140" REF="143">
She now relieved her op|pre&s;&s;ed
heart in one of tho&s;e little mo|nologues
her innocence had rendered ha|bitual.</P>
<P>"Then are my father's &s;u&s;picions veri|fied!
All that he &s;aid, how &s;evere! how
true! What confidence can we be&s;tow on
our a&s;&s;ociates! Friend&s;hip, how thy name
is abu&s;ed! Simplicity, how thy air is mi|micked!
This wicked woman&mdash;Charles
too&mdash;They mu&s;t be united! She is em|ployed
by him for the purpo&s;e of &s;educ|ing
me! Every my&s;tery is now revealed.
He was frequently quoting Thom&s;on's
"boundle&s;s confidence of &s;oul;"&mdash;&s;o too
did the licentious Sedley! She was un|willing
to part with me at fir&s;t; &s;he now
offers me a refuge in her hou&s;e; &s;he would
even change her re&s;idence to receive me!
This day &s;he told me that Charles loved
me!&mdash;Hypocrite, how have I e&s;caped your
toils? And Charles too, refined di&s;&s;em|bler!
<PB N="141" REF="144">
Does he deceive me, who&s;e image
my fancy cheri&s;hed next to my father's?
He protected me from Dandelion&mdash;I
thought it generous; I find it mean&mdash;He would re&s;erve me for his prey! Oh
Emily, poor de&s;erted girl! I feel now as
if the whole earth had con&s;pired again&s;t
me. Where &s;hall I fly?"</P>
<P>"To the&s;e arms!" exclaimed Vaurien,
as he entered the parlour, throwing him|&s;elf
at her feet. "Your face, Mi&s;s Emily,
is covered with tears. Refu&s;e me not the
con&s;olation of uniting mine. Not a tear
on your face but melts on my heart.
Tell me your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, accept my little
aid. I have heard &s;ome abrupt effu&s;ions
of &s;orrow; I cannot live and forget them."</P>
<P>Emily, confu&s;ed, he&s;itating, and deeply
&s;obbing, had lo&s;t her voice. Her fine
auburn tre&s;&s;es fell in di&s;order on her face
and her neck; &s;he rai&s;ed two dewy eyes to
heaven; the tears fell, and glittered on her
<PB N="142" REF="145">
hair; &s;he looked a Magdalen of Guido.
Vaurien, with gentlene&s;s placed her in a
chair; he knelt, took her hand, imprinted
a fervid ki&s;s; &s;he had not even the pre|&s;ence
of mind to re&s;i&s;t, or to perceive his
improper attitude. The image of her fa|ther
was before her; &s;he gazed in a &s;ilent
agony of imagination; her tears were re|newed;
Vaurien was emboldened by her
in&s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;At this in&s;tant Charles
&s;lung open the door&mdash;He uttered an au|dible
ejaculation. Emily &s;tarted. "Where
am I?" &s;he cried. "Is it you, Sir?"
and &s;he darted a glance of anger and
horror.</P>
<P>"Think 'tis no one!" replied Charles
quickly, and hurried from the room.</P>
<P>"Deceiver!" murmured Emily. She
covered her face with her hands, and &s;at
ab&s;orbed in grief. Vaurien compo&s;ed his
attitude, and &s;tood near her chair. Such
was the confu&s;ion of Emily's mind, that
<PB N="143" REF="146">
few traces of what had occurred left their
impre&s;&s;ions on her recollection. The en|trance
of Charles had revived her anger
and her fear. When &s;he turned her eyes
on Vaurien, &s;he looked with kindne&s;s; &s;he
con&s;idered that his pre&s;ence had proved
her protection.</P>
<P>Vaurien caught the in&s;tant change.
"Do me the honour, Mi&s;s Balfour, of &s;uf|fering
my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. What occa&s;ions this
great di&s;tre&s;s?"</P>
<P>"You &s;ee before you the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable
of her &s;ex. A woman without a
friend."</P>
<P>"Say not &s;o, adorable Mi&s;s Emily;
whoever knows you mu&s;t be your friend;
and if a &s;ofter name would not offend,
there is who would only live to pre|&s;erve
it."</P>
<P>"Alas! Sir, you mean not to irritate
a &s;pirit already wounded. I have hung
ever the verge of de&s;truction, blindly,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
feebly, yet boldly. O were my father liv|ing!
Angel in heaven! art thou in&s;en&s;ible
to the voice of thy daughter? On earth
thou did&s;t open to her the volume of
her fate; and now can thy paternal ten|derne&s;s
not reach thy mi&s;erable wan|derer?"</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s Emily, your imagination
is di&s;turbed. Calm the vehemence of feel|ing;
inform, but do not agitate me."</P>
<P>"Mr. Vaurien, you perhaps can inform
me. You know where I lodged with my
father. The woman &s;ays, it is to you and
Mr. Charles &s;he owes her exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>"Ah! Mi&s;s Emily," replied Vaurien,
turning a&s;ide his head, "'tis a delicate
&s;ubject; let your &s;ilence &s;pare my feel|ings."</P>
<P>"Nay, dear Sir, I mu&s;t &s;ay more, much
more. You mu&s;t tell me all if you would
be my friend. Mi&s;s Million has this mo|ment
told me, that that woman&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148">
"Is a low pro&s;titute."&mdash;Vaurien &s;pared
her the words.</P>
<P>"And you, Sir, have protected her?"
&s;aid Emily, quickly.</P>
<P>"She is the friend of Charles," conti|nued
Vaurien; "I knew nothing of her.
Common charity makes no di&s;tinctions
among it's fir&s;t claimants; I prefer a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing
the worthle&s;s, rather than to chill the
warmth of my heart by enquiries, which
may delay too late the &s;uccour due to the

<P>"Generous man! And is it then true?
I know nothing of human nature. I
thought her a &s;uffering angel."</P>
<P>"Native goodne&s;s! I repeat, &s;he is an
infamous woman. Charles is her friend.
I will never more enter that hou&s;e: but
&s;urely they have not mole&s;ted your tran|quillity?"</P>
<P>"O much, much!" cried Emily. "O

father &s;urely protected me. This woman
had &s;uch facile tears on her face, &s;uch
unobtru&s;ive goodne&s;s, &s;uch concealed me|rits.
There is a refinement in depravity.
I thought, till now, that the wicked af|fected
an o&s;tentatious virtue."</P>

<P>VAURIEN, when he met Charles
on his return, rallied him for his
abrupt departure from Emily. "She is
a fini&s;hed coquette," &s;aid he, "when
you are pre&s;ent, but alone &s;he is one of
tho&s;e dangerous girls, with overflowing
hearts, who are apt to throw us off our
guard. You witne&s;&s;ed her charming di&s;|order.
'Twas lucky you entered! A
glance invites her, a word po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her.
She is now coming to Lady Belfield; a
cha&s;te pair of doves to be yoked to the
car of Venus! Could you imagine that
the female character is &s;o deceptive?
<PB N="148" REF="151">
But deception is their occupation and their
amu&s;ement, their <HI>utile</HI> and their <HI>dulce.</HI>"</P>
<P>Charles li&s;tened with horror, and &s;hud|dered
with reflection. Vaurien dropt &s;e|veral
ob&s;cure hints of former interviews
with Emily, and exhibited &s;uch con|firmed
familiarity, and offered to &s;hare
her favours with &s;uch friendly confidence,
that Charles, recollecting the vi&s;ible de|light
which Emily took in all the con|ver&s;ations
of Vaurien, and that di&s;dainful
glance with which &s;he harrowed his &s;oul
when he broke in while Vaurien was at
her feet, blamed his precipitation of pa&s;|&s;ion
and contracted di&s;cernment, con|cluded
the Gaul to be the favoured lover,
and &s;u&s;pected the purity of Emily.</P>
<P>"Ah! my friend," he cried, "would
I were but bani&s;hed from this hou&s;e!
Patiently I cannot &s;uffer one whom I re|vered
as an angel to become before my

eyes an a&s;&s;ociate for Lady Belfield. To
view her will be hourly to revive regrets,
which, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by ab&s;ence, may &s;lowly
die away. Exi&s;tence becomes a torture
in her pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>"<HI>Tres bien!</HI>" &s;aid Vaurien, mu&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the mean while Lady Belfield had
made exact enquiries relative to Mrs.
Wil&s;on; nor did John&s;on, the old friend
of Charles, he&s;itate to give into her Lady|&s;hip's
idea of the entire tran&s;action, &s;o
prone are the be&s;t men to decide by ap|pearances.
His Lord&s;hip had been al|ready
prepared to unite with Lady Bel|field's
mea&s;ures; and a few days after
the above conver&s;ation with Vaurien,
Charles found on his table a note from
her Lady&s;hip, in her own hand-writing,
containing a final di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Her Lady|&s;hip
laid con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s on his offen|&s;ive
and degrading connections.&mdash;"Mrs.
Wil&s;on," cried Charles, "will her&s;elf
<PB N="150" REF="153">

this moment the following letter was
brought from this unfortunate wo|man:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Scarcely can my &s;cattered thoughts
collect to addre&s;s you. I have &s;ettled
my affairs. The &s;um you &s;o benevolently
a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with will accompany this.
I have taken my departure. I fly I
know not whither.</P>
<P>I forget to acquaint you with the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance that involves my
ruin. The hateful character in which
once I rather erred than &s;inned, carries
it's puni&s;hment when the crime has long
cea&s;ed. No human benevolence can
now efface from my heart the indelible
degradation. I have mentioned to you,
that to Mi&s;s Emily I revealed all my
hi&s;tory, excepting that humiliating pe|riod
<PB N="151" REF="154">
when your hand, prompted alone
by charity, &s;natched me from &s;o many
nightly horrors. Yes, I concealed this
hideous feature of my life. Could Mi&s;s
Emily have embraced a pro&s;titute? And
yet from this &s;mall failure of &s;incerity
I derive this agony of mind, which at|taches
the mi&s;ery of turpitude and &s;hame
while I can think.</P>
<P>I waited on her (will you forgive
me?) to reveal your &s;tate of mind, which
you do not even &s;u&s;pect I know; but
could I &s;ee you peri&s;h in &s;ilence? Yes,
Sir, the eye of gratitude &s;ecretly &s;tudied
your every ge&s;ture, your every inter|rupted
idea, your every evane&s;cent a&s;pi|ration;
gratitude watched and divined
your heart. Emily has traced you in
&s;ome concealed offices of kindne&s;s; her
voice told her gratitude, her blu&s;hes her
love.</P>

It is at intervals I write&mdash;I was re|cognized
by a &s;ervant&mdash;My face glows,
my hand trembles, my tongue is parched,
a fever preys on my vitals. Others will
tell you of my &s;hame. Heaven has &s;et it's
mark on my face, and I wander a female
Cain. A terrible thought flies and returns
to my imagination&mdash;Shall a mother be a
murderer? An in&s;tant would make my
children angels. Yes, fearle&s;sly could I
rai&s;e to the Father of all Mercies an arm
of blood; the blood of my children would

of the cha&s;ti&s;ement and the contrition of
their mother!</P>

<P>It was but phren&s;y! the agony of

<P>"Mo&s;t unfortunate of her &s;ex!" cried
Charles, "her life points a moral. It is
a le&s;&s;on for the times. A dereliction from
<PB N="154" REF="157">
cha&s;tity is puni&s;hed with exce&s;&s;ive &s;eve|rity,
and unju&s;t puni&s;hments produce real
crimes. Woman mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t the combined
attacks of love; that pa&s;&s;ion, which our
modes of education and our manners
have taught her to think is the important
occupation of life; but the negligence of
a parent, an accidental occurrence, an
un&s;u&s;picious moment, a wandering of
&s;en&s;ibility, a refined intrigue, the certi|tude
of confidence, and the fondne&s;s of
affection, overpower or inveigle that mo|ral
&s;entiment, which otherwi&s;e would have
per&s;evered in it's habitual duties. Woman
requires, therefore, a more energetic for|titude
than even man; but fortitude is
ma&s;culine; and a female &s;tands unpro|tected
amid&s;t the illu&s;ions of her heart.
But when the hateful life of pro&s;titution
is derived merely from the indigence and
de&s;pair of virtue, it is &s;till cha&s;ti&s;ed with
the &s;ame torture; the dome&s;tic porch of
<PB N="155" REF="158">
Peace is for ever clo&s;ed. Such unhappy
wanderers are inured to viciou&s;ne&s;s by our
barbarous and unrelenting accu&s;ations.
A wi&s;e and philo&s;ophical regulation of the
illu&s;trious Frederick prohibited, under &s;e|vere
penalties, the a&s;per&s;ion of that female
who had returned to the arms of her
friends, and to the renewal of tho&s;e do|me&s;tic
virtues which &s;he had &s;u&s;pended
rather than de&s;erted. How long will phi|lanthropy
tranquilly gaze on a va&s;t multi|tude
of females peri&s;hing in youth!</P>
<P>"Poor Wil&s;on, thou art no criminal!&mdash;and yet thou wert a pro&s;titute. Child
of &s;en&s;ibility! thy heart would bur&s;t at
the accu&s;ation; thou did&s;t ru&s;h in the
darkne&s;s of the night to feed thy peri&s;hing
children&mdash;Thou could'&s;t not have been
a pro&s;titute in the blaze of day! And I,
who would not &s;uffer a widow and her
children to peri&s;h in the &s;treets, am now
involved in her apparent criminality.
<PB N="156" REF="159">
John&s;on cen&s;ured me for having formed
di&s;graceful connections; and to her Lady|&s;hip
I can now no more refer this unhappy
fugitive. He who aids unfortunate vir|tue
(for this woman is mo&s;t virtuous) po|pular
prejudice decrees as a participator
in a libertini&s;m he abhors!</P>
<P>"And Emily then knows my pa&s;&s;ion;
and has &s;o long deceived Mrs. Wil&s;on?&mdash;The flower that is covered with the vir|gin
dews of innocence can then conceal a
young and foul &s;erpent! Yes, her I have
&s;een; Vaurien, I have heard; her infu|riate
glance &s;hivered my frame. Yet can
I never forget her. I loved her when I
thought her virtuous; and I now mu&s;t
mourn her, as if a &s;udden death had
deprived me of her whom I loved.
The plea&s;ures of life are not for me;
I will &s;it by the &s;ide of their tomb,
and think of the departed happine&s;s it
holds."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160">
He now framed a re&s;pectful reply to
Lady Belfield, related the nature of his
connection with Mrs. Wil&s;on, and lament|ed
that her abrupt flight mu&s;t render his
conduct my&s;terious. When he quitted
the hou&s;e, Vaurien conver&s;ed with him
in a tenderne&s;s of tone, that &s;eemed as
if he were &s;hedding tears, and he in&s;i&s;ted
on his accepting a liberal loan to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him in his pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>Old friend&s;hips, that have been inter|rupted
rather through inattention than
pride, are in adver&s;ity viewed by an eye
that, clouded with a tear, gives a peculiar
tenderne&s;s to the object on which it re|verts.
Charles flew to John&s;on, and
poured in his hone&s;t ear the change of
his fortunes. John&s;on repeated his old
ob&s;ervation on the danger of bad con|nections:
"However," he continued,
"tru&s;t me, that Lady Belfield has &s;ome
concealed rea&s;on for this di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; &s;he
<PB N="158" REF="161">
cannot con&s;cientiou&s;ly object to any form
of intrigue. I re&s;pect your &s;ilence; but
it in&s;tructs me. And what now think you
of your friend Vaurien?"</P>
<P>Charles replied, "He is the mo&s;t en|gaging
of men, and the mo&s;t tender of
friends. My honourable connections would
have &s;et me afloat on the wide &s;ea of life
without ma&s;t or rudder. The prompt
kindne&s;s of Vaurien &s;upplies the ungen|tlene&s;s
of Fortune; he has voluntarily
lent me a con&s;iderable &s;um of money,
which I refu&s;ed but for his acceptance of
my bond."</P>
<P>"So then," ob&s;erved John&s;on, "after
in&s;tilling in you an abhorrence for your
dependance on Lord Belfield, the adroit
Gaul has induced you to depend &s;olely
on his genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>Charles with warmth replied: "You
ever condemn in Vaurien tho&s;e actions
which you would prai&s;e in another."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162">
"Yes, I have learnt, young friend,
that virtue is not always implied by
actions of virtue. Does that &s;ound para|doxical?
I mu&s;t even &s;ay, that the cri|minal
is often virtuous; for as a vicious
character may think proper to perform the
duties of virtue, &s;o may the virtuous cha|racter
be pre&s;&s;ed into the commi&s;&s;ion of
crimes it abhors, but it cannot &s;hun."</P>
<P>"And there," exclaimed Charles, "you
have de&s;cribed Mrs. Wil&s;on."</P>
<P>Charles now communicated his di&s;po|&s;itions
to adopt &s;ome literary avocation;
and &s;oliciting John&s;on's opinion, he re|plied
as follows:</P>
<P>"If you de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as
a genius of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, in &s;ome ho|nourable
province of literature, whatever
may be your parts and abilities, you are
too poor, at lea&s;t by &s;everal hundreds
a year. A fini&s;hed genius, in this age,
is the labour of half a century; a writer
<PB N="160" REF="163">
now blooms at forty, and flowers at &s;ixty.
We require, in this age of ta&s;te, &s;uch
hewings, and &s;uch poli&s;hings, &s;o much of
the axe, and &s;o much of the file, and &s;o
much fillagree work, that I con&s;ider no
writer out of leading &s;trings before thirty,
&s;uppo&s;ing that then he has been care|fully
&s;waddled, nurtured with the mo&s;t
delicate pap, and eternally humoured in
what relates to place, connections, do|me&s;tic
habits, coincidences, accidents, and
a crowd of ceteras, which you will find
numbered, one by one, in Helvetius.
I &s;ee clearly now, that we &s;hall have no
more any men of genius; for after all
the&s;e pains, in which I am &s;ure no mortal
mu&s;t expect to be &s;ucce&s;sful, the mo&s;t
incon&s;iderable accident or omi&s;&s;ion may
&s;poil the whole man of genius, as poor
Tri&s;tram was ruined by the want only of
a window-pulley.</P>

what I meant by the words philo&s;ophical

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Platoni&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the characters &s;elected by
Vaurien, as per&s;ons who&s;e talents
and di&s;po&s;itions &s;eemed adapted to co|ale&s;ce
with his general views, by &s;ome
peculiar bias of their own, was an ori|ginal
enthu&s;ia&s;t, who in this hi&s;tory we
&s;hall denominate the Platoni&s;t.</P>
<P>He re&s;ided in a romantic part of Scot|land,
and had now arrived in town to
attend the progre&s;s of a great work on
polythei&s;m. He accounted it as a fa|vour
of the gods to have been enabled
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in that cheap country. There
he found a picture&s;que land&s;cape, &s;ur|rounding
a cottage retaining an antique
a&s;pect. It was indeed formed from the
<PB N="166" REF="169">
&s;mall remains of an abbey; and what is
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been a watch-tower,
&s;till &s;tands at the extremity of his gar|den,
and there he placed his library.
There, ab&s;tracted from all things and all
men, he reads Plato and Homer, and
views nothing but the &s;kies.</P>
<P>His cottage is at the entrance of a
deep fore&s;t, and the windows command
a view of the high road, a circum&s;tance
that occa&s;ions him much anxiety; and
he wi&s;hes that the cottage could only
have been viewed by the gods. His life
is &s;olitary, but mo&s;t poetical; yet we
can hardly deem that a &s;olitude which is
graced by the &s;ociety of a beauty, ro|mantic,
&s;en&s;itive, and happy. He has a
&s;et of very &s;ingular companions; a great
variety of animals and birds. His morn|ings
are con&s;ecrated in the watch-tower
to Homer and Plato; the afternoons he
gives to what he calls a conver&s;ation with
<PB N="167" REF="170">
his mute friends; in the evening he wan|ders
in the fore&s;t, explaining Plato to
his lovely companion, and concludes the
night with a hearty &s;upper, and with
the undi&s;turbed rapture that flows from
a heart that beats in uni&s;on with his
own.</P>
<P>At &s;chool he formed this devotion for
Homer, and a pedant in&s;pired a poet.
It was owing to the accidental literary
bigotry of his ma&s;ter, and his ince&s;&s;ant
reverence of that poet, which was not
prompted by the ardour of ta&s;te, but
by the frenzy of verbal critici&s;m. The
bu&s;t of Homer was placed over his chim|ney-piece,
the head of Homer was en|graven
on his &s;eal, and in his hours of
&s;adne&s;s he con&s;oled him&s;elf with an Ho|merical
ver&s;e, and in his hours of mer|riment
he toa&s;ted the old Meonian, by
pouring a generous libation to his me|mory.
The infatuation of the ma&s;ter
<PB N="168" REF="171">
was communicated to the &s;cholar; but
the impre&s;&s;ions were of a more delicate
and &s;ublime nature. In one it was the
impotent extravagance of a frigid verbal|i&s;t;
but in the other it became a de|bauchery
of &s;en&s;ibility, breaking from a
mo&s;t inflammable and ab&s;tru&s;e imagina|tion.
He had unfortunately plunged
deeply into the commentaries of certain
Platoni&s;ts, who explain Homer into alle|gories,
di&s;cover cele&s;tial &s;y&s;tems, and con|vert
the Iliad into a Greek Bible of the
arcana of nature.</P>
<P>When he quitted the &s;chool, his mind
was deeply tinctured by all the colori|fications
of the Platonic pri&s;m. He
mu&s;ed on the bewitching notion of uni|ver&s;al
beauty, which pervades that enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
philo&s;ophy; but when at length
he obtained a complete copy of Plato's
works, the intellectual malady diffu&s;ed
it&s;elf in every nerve of his mind; and
<PB N="169" REF="172">
&s;uch was the conflict of his animal &s;pi|rits,
that he could never read Plato with|out
violent palpitations of the heart, and
more than once &s;uch has been the agony
of his &s;en&s;ibility, that he fainted over the
volume as he held it with a kind of religi|ous
tremor. The&s;e indeed are the peculiar
features of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that ab&s;traction of
the imagination which roves amid&s;t un|known
&s;cenes, and gazes on poetical chi|meras.
It is felt by poets in the fury of
their orga&s;m, by philo&s;ophers in the ideal
fabrication of their &s;y&s;tems, and by my&s;|tics
in their attempts to ab&s;tract them|&s;elves
from earth to heaven.</P>
<P>When we read the di&s;coveries of ano|ther,
we acquire a &s;pirit of di&s;covery.
The imitative genius of man becomes
every thing to which it is accu&s;tomed.
He read of a thou&s;and fine meanings in
Plato and Homer, which he could never
have imagined, but having once ima|gined
<PB N="170" REF="173">
them, he added a thou&s;and more of
his own. A mind like his only requires
the &s;cattering of a &s;mall handful of &s;eed to
cover it's exten&s;ive and fertile &s;oil with a
va&s;t efflore&s;cence; and like that happy
climate that feels not the rigour of a
changing &s;ea&s;on, his mind was a year of
one continued &s;ummer. Every day brought
it's new di&s;covery, and every day was a
day of triumph.</P>
<P>Like other in&s;pired per&s;ons (for he
con&s;idered his delight as in&s;piration) he
now conceived it a duty to enlighten a
dark and erring world. "All Europe,"
he cried "is &s;urrounded by a di&s;mal
night; hence men are continually mo|le&s;ting
each other, and one man only im|pedes
another while he him&s;elf is im|peded."
He ob&s;erved old religions de|caying,
while modern &s;ects were filthily
&s;pawned forth, and lamely crawled from
each antiquated and expiring mon&s;ter.
<PB N="171" REF="174">
He fir&s;t communicated his notions to a
private circle; &s;ome con&s;idered them as
the curio&s;ities of a &s;tudent of great learn|ing,
&s;ome as the philo&s;ophical amu&s;ements
and paradoxical vanities of a man of ge|nius,
but few di&s;cerned that they were
the delu&s;ions of a literary lunacy. Their
doubts &s;oon cea&s;ed, when, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment
even of the learned world in this
clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, were
publi&s;hed two quarto volumes, in which
he avowed him&s;elf a Platoni&s;t in it's
mo&s;t religious &s;en&s;e, and in which he af|fected
to prove, that the Chri&s;tian reli|gion
was merely a ba&s;tardized and bar|barized
Platoni&s;m. The divinities of
Plato were the divinities to be adored;
and he affirmed, that no people could be
virtuous and happy if they were not
taught to call God, Jupiter; the Virgin,
Venus; and Chri&s;t, Cupid.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="175">
It was now in vain to di&s;&s;emble. His
friends attempted to rea&s;on; but logic
reforms no enthu&s;ia&s;t. An enthu&s;ia&s;t
cannot fail to gain his cau&s;e, becau&s;e he
alone can be his own judge. In vain the
world oppo&s;ed, and wor&s;e than oppo&s;ed,
neglected. He was an Atals for him&s;elf;
the &s;olitary &s;upporter of a &s;y&s;tem even
too unrea&s;onable to be adopted by phi|lo&s;ophical
rea&s;oners, and even too delu|&s;ive
to delight philo&s;ophical fanciers.
He knew, he &s;aid, he was the Gemi&s;|tus
Pletho of the age, and he was con|tent.
To the oppo&s;ing world he there|fore
oppo&s;ed Plato and Homer; and he
looked not in this barbarous age to be re|warded
with a garland in the &s;chool of
philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>He &s;aw him&s;elf de&s;erted, but forgave
the unkindne&s;s of men, becau&s;e he found
him&s;elf con&s;oled, and indeed fully occu|pied,
<PB N="173" REF="176">
by the humanity which he had di&s;|covered
in other animals. Even this was
my&s;terious, for he darkly hinted that he
was not a little ver&s;ed in the language of
bea&s;ts. He lodged in his hou&s;e a mo&s;t
numerous &s;ociety; on the &s;tairs, in his
&s;tudy, from the garrets to the cellars, and
even to the very roofs, were a&s;&s;embled a
numerous retinue of the mute citizens of
the world, and he was ob&s;erved to pa&s;s
entire days in a very large aviary of
birds.</P>
<P>The Platonic &s;y&s;tem had obtained him
&s;ome admirers among the fair &s;ex. It
was not ill adapted to their capacity;
for being incomprehen&s;ible, it's my&s;teri|ou&s;ne&s;s
irritated female curio&s;ity, and it
was at lea&s;t more &s;ublime than di&s;clo&s;ing
an enigma, or unfolding a charade. It
was pregnant with the di&s;&s;olving ener|gies
of a delicious &s;entiment; for what
the Platoni&s;t terms "the &s;cience of uni|ver&s;als,"
<PB N="174" REF="177">
is made to con&s;i&s;t in "UNI|VERSAL
BEAUTY." It was a homage
to the &s;ex. He u&s;ed &s;ometimes to break
out in expre&s;&s;ions like the&s;e: "Beauty
walks &s;ilently on the extremities of it's
feet, alluring, ravi&s;hing, and rai&s;ing all
things by it's power; it &s;wims above the
light of forms; it covers the occult union
of the gods!" The entire &s;y&s;tem was
elegant and brilliant; it exhibited only
forms of &s;ymmetry and grace; and the
female attention, that was once allured
by the ideal perfection of an eternal
beauty (the image exi&s;ting in the mind
of the divine architect) and became ini|tiated
into the Platonic doctrine of ideas,
was &s;oon entangled in a ti&s;&s;ued net of
&s;ilk and &s;ilver, that adorned rather than
perplexed the lovely captive. Where
&s;he &s;ought a ma&s;ter, &s;he found a lover;
and, entranced, li&s;tened to the eloquence
of diction, the dazzling of metaphors,
<PB N="175" REF="178">
the inexhau&s;tible poetry, and the infec|tious
enthu&s;ia&s;m of a man who came
recommended by many accompli&s;hments
of per&s;onal figure, and by many grace|ful
acquirements. The Platoni&s;t is a
ma&s;terly mu&s;ician, a &s;ublime poet, and,
when warmed, his voice is melodious,
his eye is illuminated by quick intel|ligence,
his face takes all the changes of
his &s;oul, every ge&s;ture is adapted to every
&s;entiment, and, like the Cumean Sybil,
he looks the image of in&s;piration. His
u&s;ual &s;tyle on the&s;e &s;ubjects &s;hews all
the art of poetry without it's labour;
he pours forth an opulence of diction,
and his copious periods roll with mag|nificence,
as if he were reading an Eng|li&s;h
imitation of Cicero's manner; with
felicitous expre&s;&s;ion he intenders by pa|thetic
&s;entiment, and charms by the
gaiety of exuberant imagery. Even his
my&s;tic unintelligibility becomes a grace;
<PB N="176" REF="179">
it &s;erves as a re&s;ting-place to repo&s;e the
mind that has followed him in his ele|vations;
and they who are not void of
imagination lament when the Platoni&s;t
clo&s;es his voluble and enchanting elo|cution.</P>
<P>He had long &s;ighed to unite him&s;elf
to a beautiful female, on who&s;e bo&s;om
he might meditate in rapture and re|verie.
Solitude, deprived of &s;uch a com|panion,
pre&s;ented nothing to his &s;en&s;i|tive
&s;oul but a de&s;olation of the pa&s;|&s;ions.
The bea&s;ts and birds, with all his
vaunted knowledge of their language, he
confe&s;&s;ed were not equivalent to the ab|&s;ence
of this ine&s;timable a&s;&s;ociate. Among
men he could find no companions; for
&s;uch was the extreme irritation of his
&s;en&s;ations, that his mind had refined it|&s;elf
to a feminine delicacy; it was ap|palled
by &s;erious expo&s;tulation, and
&s;hrunk in horror from coar&s;e merriment.
<PB N="177" REF="180">
In explaining the principle of beauty he
found con&s;olers and admirers among the
women; but he di&s;covered no female
whom he could &s;elect from all the world;
for to a congenial di&s;po&s;ition and a &s;ingu|lar
beauty of per&s;on he required what is
&s;till more rare, an intimate knowledge of
Greek.</P>
<P>Except a total ignorance of Greek,
Charlotte Fenton was the nymph of his
&s;oul. Nature had ca&s;t them in the &s;ame
mould; but a diver&s;ity of education had
provided different materials to &s;tore their
imagination. From childhood &s;he had
lived in a rural &s;olitude, &s;tudious of works
of the mo&s;t extravagant fancy; and all
the day and part of the night were con|&s;umed
in a little circle of magic, from
which &s;he never i&s;&s;ued. She walked
fearle&s;s on the utmo&s;t verge of romantic
fiction. With all works of rea&s;oning &s;he
<PB N="178" REF="181">
was di&s;gu&s;ted; her logic con&s;i&s;ted in &s;en|timent,
and from the impoveri&s;hed nar|ratives
of hi&s;tory, where all men to her
eye &s;eemed dwarfs, &s;he roved to the gi|gantic
heaven of Homer, who, though
&s;omewhat di&s;gui&s;ed in the ver&s;ions of
Pope, were to her &s;till heroes. She read
with avidity the ancient romances of
"Amadis de Gaul," and fea&s;ted on the
&s;ix folios of "Perce Fore&s;t;" the Ara|bian
Tales were not di&s;approved; and
Spen&s;er was the mo&s;t modern poet &s;he
read; but when our Platoni&s;t opened
the va&s;t &s;cene of his philo&s;ophical fancy,
her curio&s;ity flew with a hundred wings;
&s;he gazed in mute a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;at
hours in &s;ilent meditation.</P>
<P>But the divine Greek was the only
language by which he could communi|cate
his &s;en&s;ations. She entreated his
in&s;truction, and they had &s;carcely ad|vanced
<PB N="179" REF="182">
to the third book of the Iliad,
when the delighted Platoni&s;t thus pro|po&s;ed
a new &s;y&s;tem of life:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The ancient philo&s;ophers," he &s;aid,
"when they felt the impul&s;e of divine
energies, quitted the tumultuous habi|tations
of men. We mu&s;t fru&s;trate the
magic of Circe, and bid adieu to the
detaining arms of Calyp&s;o. For many
years mu&s;t we be exerci&s;ed in the ca|thartic
virtues, for the purpo&s;e of &s;e|parating
as much as po&s;&s;ible the &s;oul
from the dark folds of the body, and
then at length, when we have de&s;troyed
the tyranny of the pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e baneful
&s;uitors which had &s;o ba&s;ely revelled in the
palace of the &s;oul, we &s;hall enjoy the de|lightful
beams of &s;cience and wi&s;dom,
till becoming e&s;tabli&s;hed, like Uly&s;&s;es, in
our paternal port, like him we &s;hall be
united with our father, from who&s;e em|braces
we have been &s;o long unhappily
<PB N="180" REF="183">
torn away. We &s;hall find the lyre of
true philo&s;ophy on the banks of Lethe;
there let us pa&s;s away our lives in bli&s;sful
contemplations, and in li&s;tening to di|vine
harmony, &s;ecluded from the ba&s;e
multitude of mankind."</P>
<P>"And this, my lovely Charlotte, has
been the only re&s;ource of the enlightened
and pious ancients. Either we mu&s;t tra|vel
or retreat; for the delu&s;ions of mo|dern
religions are an impiety to the gods.
Pythagoras and Plato, the interpreters of
nature, con&s;idered it as nece&s;&s;ary, for the
acquirement of knowledge, to traver&s;e
many &s;eas, and inhabit many countries;
but for travelling we have no money.
Euripides compo&s;ed his tragedies in a
cave, Democritus his philo&s;ophy in a &s;e|que&s;tered
&s;pot, Demo&s;thenes became an
orator by the &s;hores of the &s;ea, and
Numa con&s;ulted the nymph Egeria in
&s;ilence and in &s;olitude. Even the imi|tators
<PB N="181" REF="184">
of the&s;e great men, Mo&s;es, Je&s;us,
and Mahomet, alike retired at &s;tated
intervals to arrange their &s;y&s;tems, athe|i&s;tical
as they are! The pre&s;ence of the
gods is only vi&s;ible in &s;olitude. Archi|medes
heard not the falling walls of his
city; Carneades, at his meals, forgot to
eat, &s;o that he had nearly been fami&s;hed
in his own hou&s;e; and what think you of
that philo&s;opher who deprived him&s;elf of
his &s;ight, that he might not be di&s;turbed
in his &s;ublime contemplations by inter|vening
objects; and that other, who, le&s;t
he might be tempted to i&s;&s;ue from his
&s;tudious retreat, &s;haved half of his head,
that it might hinder him from appearing
in the world; for in that Platonic age no
wigs were worn.</P>
<P>"I langui&s;h for retirement, that I may
compo&s;e a life of Homer, of whom no|thing

<P>One of the favourite projects of Vau|rien
was an antichri&s;tian hope to over|throw
the religion of Je&s;us. He therefore
a&s;&s;ociated with all tho&s;e, who&s;e talents or
power would co-operate with this inten|tion.
He de&s;ired to overturn Chri&s;tia|nity,
not becau&s;e it was a &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion,
but a &s;y&s;tem of opulence; he was
no enemy to the New Te&s;tament, but to
the bench of Bi&s;hops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vaurien had al&s;o another rea&s;on for his hatred of Chri&s;tianity; it's principles were too peaceful, too &s;elf-mortifying, and too enervating. But the pre&s;ent times are as &s;anguinary as tho&s;e of any for|mer period; and we do not &s;ee why &s;ome &s;hould &s;o much di&s;like Chri&s;tianity for the&s;e cau&s;es, &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are now as ferocious <HI>cut-throats</HI> as tho&s;e of ancient times. Be it as it may, Vaurien's idea of Chri&s;tianity appears in the following <HI>pens&eacute;e</HI> of Beaumelle, p. 177: "Pagani&s;m, accu&s;toming men to ferocity by &s;anguinary &s;acrifices, in deifying great generals and courageous citizens, their wi&s;e legi&s;lators in&s;pired a love of liberty.

Chri&s;tianity talks too much of heaven, to induce much attachment to the objects of the earth, and by inculcating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to monar|chy, is an enemy to all rea&s;oning."</NOTE>. He had formed
a &s;trict intimacy with the Platoni&s;t, and
<PB N="188" REF="191">
now vi&s;ited him, to &s;timulate his indu&s;try
in the promulgation of polythei&s;tical pub|lications,</P>
<P>When he arrived at his hou&s;e, the love|ly
Charlotte informed him, that the Pla|toni&s;t
was then occupied at his prayers,
in chaunting a noon-day hymn to Apollo.
"You then," &s;aid Vaurien, "do not unite
<PB N="189" REF="192">
in his prayers?" Charlotte replied, "I
hold Apollo in no e&s;teem, becau&s;e of his
ill u&s;age of Daphne. We women are wil|ling
to be won, but not to be forced.
It is cruel to per&s;ecute what we cannot
&s;ubdue. Venus is my protector."&mdash;Vau|rien
looked langui&s;hingly on Charlotte,
and exclaimed, "Venus likewi&s;e is the
godde&s;s of young men; I wor&s;hipped her
in the remains of her temple in Greece."
"Good Gods!" cried the romantic Char|lotte,
"thou then art my amiable bro|ther;
the fir&s;t I have met who has paid
due reverence to my divinity. The Pla|toni&s;t
is mindle&s;s of her daily ori&s;ons.
Were we but in her temple to perform
her rites, as Herodotus de&s;cribes!"&mdash;"All
heaven, all earth, is her temple!" ex|claimed
Vaurien; "and &s;ure the blu&s;hes
that breathe like ro&s;es on that cheek, the
liquid brilliancy of tho&s;e eyes, the &s;oft
heavings of that bo&s;om, proclaim the
<PB N="190" REF="193">
pre&s;ence of the divinity."&mdash;"Ah!" &s;aid
Charlotte, "you are the fir&s;t man who
ever joined me in a votive te&s;timony to
Venus."</P>
<P>By this time the Platoni&s;t had con|cluded
his long hymn to Apollo. Vau|rien
now a&s;cended with difficulty. At the
bottom of the &s;tairs was a large kennel
of dogs of various nations, who lived in
a good under&s;tanding with each other,
excepting when a bone was thrown among
them, for then the dogs behaved like men,
that is, they mangled and tore each other
to pieces with &s;agacity and without re|mor&s;e.
Monkeys and apes were chained
on the bani&s;ters. A little republic of cats
was peaceably e&s;tabli&s;hed on the fir&s;t land|ing
place. He pa&s;&s;ed through one room
which was an aviary, and another which
was an apiary.</P>
<P>From the cieling of the &s;tudy of the
Platoni&s;t depended a poli&s;hed globe of
<PB N="191" REF="194">
plated gla&s;s, which &s;trongly reflected the
beams of the &s;un. Amid&s;t this aching
&s;plendor &s;at the Platoni&s;t, changing his
&s;eat with the motions of his god, &s;o that
in the cour&s;e of the day he and the &s;un
went regularly round the apartment. He
was occupied in con&s;tructing a magic
lanthorn, which puerile amu&s;ement ex|cited
the &s;urpri&s;e of Vaurien.</P>
<P>The Platoni&s;t accounted for it. "My
di&s;&s;ertation on the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries is
not all under&s;tood. The whole machinery,
reflected on a white &s;heet, will be more
intelligible than any I could give on a
&s;heet of paper. In the pre&s;ence of the
gods, in the mo&s;t holy of the my&s;teries,
daemons appeared with the heads of dogs;
Pletho &s;ays this, who lived a thou&s;and
years after the my&s;teries. Then I have
'omniform and terrific mon&s;ters;' then
the demiurgus, the progre&s;s of purgation,
in&s;pection, crowning, torch-bearing, and,
<PB N="192" REF="195">
finally, friend&s;hip with the gods. But
here is the great difficulty. How &s;hall I
repre&s;ent 'the intolerable effulgence of the
divine light?' Much it grieves me, that
for this &s;ublime purpo&s;e a candle and a
piece of coloured tin are all I can get into
the lanthorn. The gods are not always fa|vourable
to my attempts. After long expe|riments,
I conceived I had di&s;covered the
perpetual &s;epulchral lamp of the ancients.
La&s;t week I invited my friends to a phi|lo&s;ophical
lecture on my perpetual lamp;
I triumphed in my di&s;covery; but ere
my lecture clo&s;ed my lamp was &s;uddenly
extingui&s;hed. Good Gods!"</P>
<P>Vaurien condoling with him on the
imperfection of all human repre&s;entations
of the divinity, and the extinction of a
perpetual lamp, enquired the rea&s;on for
his &s;ingular attachment to the mute crea|tion?
Here the Platoni&s;t a&s;&s;umed a dig|nified
air, threw him&s;elf back in his chair,
<PB N="193" REF="196">
to receive the full beams of the &s;un, then
mu&s;ing, rai&s;ed his kindled eyes on Vau|rien,
and addre&s;&s;ed him:&mdash;"To you,
whom I re&s;pect as the great reformer of
the age, who feel a piety for the gods,
and aid their &s;olitary adorer, I will un|fold
the in&s;pirations of wi&s;dom."</P>
<P>"Know then, that all men are brutes,
and all brutes are men. At fir&s;t their figu|ration
appears materially different, but
it is not &s;o in reality. Many brutes ap|proach
clo&s;ely to the human form; and
among men, many approach clo&s;ely to
the brutal form. We have monkey
faces, bull heads, a&s;inine countenances,
&s;pider legs, and porpoi&s;e obe&s;ity; and
among females we have the face of a
tygre&s;s, cat-like claws, owl-like &s;creech|ings,

take for in&s;tance the ape, he is a perfect
&s;imilitude of man; the paws of an ape
are much like our own; why then, you
would &s;ay, have apes not made an equal

<P>"And this I affirm, that in tho&s;e arts
and &s;ciences which are of real utility to
<PB N="196" REF="199">
animals and birds, they excel all man|kind.
Can the weaver's loom &s;pread the
finene&s;s of the &s;pider's web? Can the
architect build like the beaver? Sails
the mariner like the nautilus? And in

Who climbs and hangs &s;ecurer on

far greater perfection than our&s;elves, that
peculiar art or &s;cience they de&s;ire. To
excel in any, we advi&s;e a man of genius
to apply only to a &s;ingle pur&s;uit. 'Tis
preci&s;ely what does every brute, and
therefore I aver, that every brute is a
man of genius."</P>
<P>Here the Platoni&s;t pau&s;ed, and de&s;ired

The voice of the raven is &s;olemn;

concealing &s;ome cheri&s;hed abode, heroic
acts of &s;exual attachment, and a &s;pirit of
&s;ociality, that, if interrupted, has an in|fluence
on the health, the pa&s;&s;ions, and
the enjoyments of the friendly brute.</P>
<P>"Delicate birds have their vanities as
well as delicate people. A goldfinch be|fore
a mirror is a perfect coquette; &s;he

is provided with a little bucket and chain,
&s;he will draw it up, and then look around
that her ingenuity may not pa&s;s unob|&s;erved.
Delicate birds have al&s;o an ex|qui&s;ite
delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion. The wild ca|nary

<P>ANOTHER favourite project of Vau|rien,
was that of a&s;&s;embling the di&s;|per&s;ed
Hebrews. This impious project
(as a good Catholic terms it) was not pe|culiar
to the political imagination of this
Gaul; &s;ince, among others, two of his
compatriots meditated the &s;ame de&s;ign.
The Marquis of Langalerie, at the com|mencement
of this century, di&s;appointed

&s;overeignty over the wanderers of I&s;rael.
This project is of that inviting and plau|&s;ible
kind, that it will never be extinct
in the romantic and chimerical heads of
&s;ome fervid adventurers; but there exi&s;t
oppo&s;ing rea&s;ons in the character of this
people, which, depending on principles
in nature, are irrever&s;ible. The children
of Jacob are compo&s;ed of all nations, and
cannot blend alike with the people among
whom they re&s;ide; as there are metals in
nature, which no chymical proce&s;s can

<P>Vaurien had made acquaintance with
a Jewi&s;h philo&s;opher, and called on him
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e he had vi&s;ited the
Platoni&s;t. He found the Jew at dinner,
eating pork-chops; and at the &s;ide of his
plate lie open the Jewi&s;h Mendel&s;ohn's
Phaedon, a &s;ublime imitation of Plato on
<PB N="216" REF="219">
the immortality of the &s;oul. The Jew
de&s;ired to conclude his meal quietly, and
proceeded in employing at once his teeth
and his eyes; but the head dige&s;ts not
like the mouth; and the Jew had now &s;o
violently ab&s;tracted his imagination, that
Vaurien ro&s;e with impatience. The phi|lo&s;opher
then &s;tarted from his reverie, and
lamenting that the &s;ublime&s;t conceptions
were the ob&s;cure&s;t, clo&s;ed his Plato, and
li&s;tened to the Gallic Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>"How long &s;hall philo&s;ophy," ex|claimed
Vaurien, "mourn over the de|gradation
of the human &s;pecies? Our
great revolution ferments the &s;pirits of
all our European youth, and of every
friend to the rights of man. France has
emancipated the negroes, France would
emancipate the Jews. Whenever the le|gi&s;lator
violates the equality of nature,
the &s;tate appears to retain &s;laves; but, in
reality, it lo&s;es &s;o many patriots. I was
<PB N="217" REF="220">
pre&s;ent at one of the late earthquakes in
Italy. The multitude were gazing on the
ruins of a town; the nobles &s;ighed at the
ve&s;tiges of their grandeur; the opulent
citizens mourned their buried fortunes.
A voice from the multitude broke the
melancholy &s;ilence, exclaiming, 'Now WE
ARE ALL EQUAL.' A &s;ublime and ter|rible
truth! Unhappy is that country,
whatever be it's grandeur, in which a
great portion of it's citizens would con|&s;ider
exile as no puni&s;hment, and an
earthquake would communicate the &s;en|&s;ation
of delighted vengeance. And this
mu&s;t be the feeling of every Indian Ne|gro
and every European Jew. Every
where found, and no where re&s;pected,
wherever ye wander ye drag along the
&s;ame ignominious chain."</P>
<P>"You deliver your&s;elf," replied the Jew,
"with the voluble eloquence of your na|tion.
In this temperate climate we fear

I conceive it my duty, as it is my

<P>BESIDES the revolutionary a&s;&s;embly
at Lord Belfield's, unknown to his
Lord&s;hip a &s;ecret committee met at the
hou&s;e of Mr. Reverberator. They now
joined, and Vaurien addre&s;&s;ed them:&mdash;</P>
<P>"In England you have adopted two
modes of getting rid of your kings; the
reigns of Charles I. and James II. have
produced to your nation more real uti|lity
than if they had been the mo&s;t ex|emplary
princes. They have taught all
&s;overeigns, that there are different man|ners
of regal puni&s;hment; by death or
expul&s;ion. Let every citizen give his
<PB N="252" REF="255">
opinion re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent monarch,
whom we have agreed to dethrone."</P>
<P>"Expel with a pen&s;ion," &s;aid Sub|tile.</P>
<P>"Expel with a pen&s;ion," echoed Re|verberator.</P>
<P>"Expel without a pen&s;ion," cried Dr.
Bounce. "He never gave me a living."</P>
<P>"Behead him," &s;aid Rant.</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him," exclaimed Dra|gon.</P>
<P>"This la&s;t mode," ob&s;erved Vaurien,
"combines expedition, &s;afety, and tran|quillity.
But this king, through a long
reign, has not <HI>rebelled</HI> again&s;t his people,
nor will his people ea&s;ily rebel again&s;t a
&s;overeign, who, without imbecillity is
affectionate, without effeminacy is do|me&s;tic,
without tyranny is firm; a mo|narch,
who, like another Augu&s;tus, &s;uf|fered
without a murmur, although it co&s;t
a tear, the horrid calumnies of an eternal
<PB N="253" REF="256">
Aretine; yes, the father of his country &s;uf|fered
him&s;elf what he could not permit the
ob&s;cure&s;t individual to &s;uffer; he tru&s;ted
to the purity of his life, and to the voice
of his &s;ubjects; a &s;overeign, who&s;e confi|dence
in their affections <HI>was</HI> &s;uch, that
he would have reclined his head and &s;lept
on the bo&s;om of his meane&s;t &s;ubject:
but kings mu&s;t fall if we would ri&s;e."</P>
<P>"There is a vile rheumatic wind from
that door," exclaimed Subtile; "clo&s;e it,
Reverberator."</P>
<P>Reverberator, after &s;ome ineffectual at|tempts,
cried, "Cur&s;e the door, it will
neither open nor &s;hut; the hinges are
dropt."</P>
<P>Vaurien &s;miled, ob&s;erving, "the mo|narchy
of that &s;tate then is di&s;&s;olved. A
door mu&s;t have it's hinges."</P>
<P>"But it does not follow," cried Dra|gon,
with a frown, "that a &s;tate mu&s;t
have it's king. You Gauls catch at
<PB N="254" REF="257">
every remote allu&s;ion, burle&s;que the &s;o|lemnity
of your councils, and ruin your
cau&s;e by your eloquence. Speak le&s;s,
think more, and let your arm be your
voice."</P>
<P>"A &s;imile is harmle&s;s," replied Vau|rien;
"but to proceed: May not the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated? The king is
loved."</P>
<P>"A poi&s;oned arrow blown through a
tube; it &s;trikes like the lightning; the
invi&s;ible is alone traced in it's effect,"
cried Dragon.</P>
<P>"Well thought," ob&s;erved Vaurien;
"kings to re&s;pect the people mu&s;t fear
them; therefore they mu&s;t be beheaded
or expelled."</P>
<P>"You ob&s;erve," &s;aid Subtile, turning to
Reverberator, "how exact are my com|putations!
This morning I calculated
all our opinions, and ca&s;ting up all the
probabilities and the po&s;&s;ibilities, I com|puted
<PB N="255" REF="258">
a certitude, that this evening we
&s;hould determine on a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. But I
have prepared another calculation. You
propo&s;e, Dragon, that it &s;hould take place
when the King goes to Parliament. The
chances are again&s;t you; for the wind
may blow again&s;t the arrow, or the arrow
may, for aught I know, be inhaled into
your own throat. Then, there are the
hor&s;es, who, added together with his Ma|je&s;ty,
make &s;o many to one you mi&s;s.
We &s;hould never &s;tir a foot without cal|culation.
When John&s;on entered a room
he u&s;ed to number and to mea&s;ure his
&s;teps; it is thought to have been &s;uper|&s;tition;
I believe it was done metaphy&s;i|cally;
for it a&s;toni&s;hes me, that not more
legs are broken daily, &s;ince few calculate
their &s;teps, and a &s;ingle one, too long, or
too &s;hort, may over&s;et a man."</P>
<P>"Nature," &s;aid Vaurien, "effects her
facile operations without the intervention
<PB N="256" REF="259">
of metaphy&s;ics. We calculate nature, but
are only amu&s;ed by our figures. A new
fact overturns an old &s;y&s;tem. Reflect,
my friends, on the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;patch.
What has been done at the Tower?"</P>
<P>Dragon replied, "This morning, for
two hours, the tri-coloured flag was hung
out, to the amazement and terror of the
town. I got a boy to do this, merely by
half an hour's conver&s;ation on liberty.
Boys form the be&s;t citizens; every argu|ment
to them is new and incontrovertible.
I dare &s;ay, Citizen Rant, you find this at
your lectures."</P>
<P>To which Rant an&s;wered: "Citizens,
my lungs, my arms, my feet, this cadave|rous
face, and the&s;e ferocious locks, flying
like the &s;erpent hair of furies, perform
miracles among apprentices. I have learnt
the French language &s;ince the revolution.
I talk of Con&s;tantinople, while every one
knows I mean London; of Mahomet,
<PB N="257" REF="260">
when I &s;trike at Je&s;us; and of a con&s;piracy
of the &s;even kings again&s;t the liberties of
infant Rome, when I clearly de&s;cribe the
allied powers. It is thus I defy all law.
Helvetius did the &s;ame. Is not this ge|nius
in <HI>me?</HI> All comes from Helvetius;
he is the <HI>ova</HI> of human nature. The
learned London Corre&s;ponding Society,
our re&s;pectable book&s;ellers of 'Pig's-meat,'
and our political mi&s;&s;ionaries, de&s;erve well
of the republic; but they per&s;i&s;t all in
<HI>printing</HI> what they have to &s;ay. I have
<HI>printed</HI> in every cla&s;s of literature; but
whatever is mo&s;t energetic from my tri|bune
makes no impre&s;&s;ion in <HI>print.</HI> My
works are like the acidity of lemon
&s;queezed on &s;alts of wormwood; if the
in&s;tant froth is not caught 'tis vapidne&s;s!
My &s;atire is termed outrageous ribaldry;
my eloquence, inflated gaudine&s;s; my
thoughts, tedious common place; 'tis &s;aid,
I have neither &s;implicity nor dignity, nei|ther
<PB N="258" REF="261">
nature nor rhetoric. But approach
my tribune, hear my &s;creams of indigna|tion,
my whi&s;pers of di&s;covery, the foam|ing
vengeance of my mouth, the thun|dering
re&s;olution of my arm, and the au|dible
contempt of my foot. I a&s;&s;ure you,
citizens, a living line of animation runs
along the room; I have &s;een the very
benches tremble with rapture, while the
oppo&s;ite echo of my voice &s;eems like that
of &s;ome divinity, heard, but not &s;een.
My butchers are re&s;olute as the gladia|tors
of Rome; my tailors are heroes to a
man; and my &s;hoemakers are &s;o many
Solons. The canaille are the nobility of
human nature."</P>
<P>"True," replied Vaurien; "and I have
always been &s;urpri&s;ed at your Engli&s;h ari|&s;tocratic
cu&s;tom of decanting Port; you
carefully reject the dregs; but the dregs
are at once victual and drink, and con|tain
more true &s;pirit than the thin upper
<PB N="259" REF="262">
liquor. Our French wine has no dregs,
for it has no body; it is all alike, lively
and &s;parkling, but it will not keep; &s;o we
drink it off all at once. Time only &s;lat|tens
and &s;ours. Let us now under&s;tand
from citizen Dragon the conduct of his
propo&s;ed ma&s;&s;acre."</P>
<P>Dragon now pu&s;hed on to the edge
of his chair, rai&s;ed two blood-&s;hot eyes
and a haggard countenance, then drawing
up part of his coat-&s;leeve till half his arm
was bared, addre&s;&s;ed the committee:</P>
<P>"Exactly a month from this night, or about
one in the morning, I have prepared my
friends. We divide in three bodies. The
fir&s;t a&s;&s;emble at Charing-cro&s;s under the
&s;tatue of the tyrant; the &s;econd collect
at the Tower; the third penetrate the
Bank. The Charing-cro&s;s party will de|capitate
by torch-light; the Tower will
provde us with arms; but I fear we may
be di&s;appointed at the Bank for money.
<PB N="260" REF="263">
However an active night does much;
when the &s;un ri&s;es we &s;hall give up the
city to pillage; that will be a kind of
current coin for the people.</P>
<P>"When I was at Paris, I &s;tudied 'the
magnificent virtues of Robe&s;pierre, and
the energetic heroi&s;m of Danton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e are the <HI>expre&s;s words</HI> to be found in Thelwall's <HI>&s;ober</HI> reflections. And God forgive his <HI>&s;obriety!</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ome Engli&s;h readers Robe&s;pierre appeared a Cicero; but the genius of his oratory con&s;i&s;ted in having retained &s;ome of the declamatory <HI>verbiage</HI> of the French writers. He was not known for any work, or other evidence of genius, before the va&s;t concu&s;&s;ion that threw &s;uch unworthy beings upper|mo&s;t. Danton was &s;ingularly illiterate, in di&s;po&s;i|tion a ruffian, in heart a coward, but in per&s;on a giant. Barrere was, or is, <HI>un poete de province a&s;&s;ez mince,</HI> a magazine contributor; Collot d'Herbois, an opera garetteer, <HI>un fai&s;eur de petits vers.</HI> Such are the men, who had never been in&s;cribed on the li&s;t of fame in France, and who&s;e names had pe|ri&s;hed, had not &s;omething more mon&s;trous than villainy urged them to become the Dracos of a great people. <HI>Great and virtuous republicans</HI> have bled on the guillotine; the names of Lavoi&s;ier, Bailly, and others, were known; but the&s;e ob&s;cure and vulgar villains, like &s;o many Phaetons, incapable of con|ducting the &s;ingular power to which they a&s;pired, have them&s;elves peri&s;hed, after &s;preading a confla|gration throughout the world.</P></NOTE>.' I
<PB N="261" REF="264">
con&s;ulted with the animated Barrere and
the calm and per&s;evering Collot d'Her|bois.
They conducted their ma&s;&s;acres on
a new plan. They fir&s;t &s;et fire to part of
Lyons, without permitting a &s;ingle ma&s;|&s;acre
to be performed in the burning
quarter, tru&s;ting to the ju&s;tice of gun|powder.
In the oppo&s;ite quarters the
patriots were mar&s;halled, and while they
performed their duties quietly on the in|habitants,
the fugitives who e&s;caped from
the flames were compelled to throw them|&s;elves
on their &s;words. This ingenious
contrivance &s;ucceeded tolerably; not &s;o
much as they de&s;ired; and they afterwards
<PB N="262" REF="265">
very patriotically voted, when they per|ceived
that they had only effected half a
ma&s;&s;acre, to raze the magnificent city of
Lyons. Here you have 'hearts no bigger
than pins heads;' you would have he&s;i|tated
at this &s;ublime ma&s;&s;acre."</P>
<P>"And do you mean," enquired Dr.
Bounce, "to de&s;troy London in your
fury? Do you mean to burn my meeting
in the Old Jewry?"</P>
<P>"Do not di&s;turb my reverie," conti|nued
Dragon, darting a fiery glance on
Bounce. "That night the two Hou&s;es
&s;hall be the lamps of liberty to illu|minate
the metropolis. Tho&s;e haughty
phantoms of &s;tate &s;hall vani&s;h. We &s;hall
walk in blood; we &s;hall &s;ee by flames.
At noon London will be half in ruins,
and half it's citizens be piled on each
other. Happy and fraterni&s;ed people!
Liberty &s;hall be the benign &s;un&s;hine to
gild the&s;e horrors, and you &s;hall be free
when you exult over your ruins."</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="266">
"How many can you a&s;&s;emble?" de|manded
Vaurien.</P>
<P>"Three hundred," replied Dragon,
nodding earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>"Calculate, calculate!" cried Subtile,
exultingly. "Not a probability; not a
po&s;&s;ibility!"</P>
<P>"You have deceived us," cried Vau|rien;
"I con&s;idered half of London was
at your devotion."</P>
<P>"Why, &s;hall we not all unite?" conti|nued
Dragon. "Rant has his appren|tices.
Do you account liberated Newgate
as nothing? Is the King's Bench unfur|ni&s;hed

"<HI>C'e&s;t un jeu perdu,</HI>" &s;aid Vaurien
"We mu&s;t give up the ma&s;&s;acre."</P>
<P>"Give up the ma&s;&s;acre!" cried Dragon,
&s;tarting from his chair, and extending his
bared arm; "I will fir&s;t ma&s;&s;acre my&s;elf.
Rant, you are &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"I never open my mouth," replied the
Lecturer, "unle&s;s I can collect an au|dience
of more than three hundred."</P>
<P>"None of you," cried Dragon, "have
made any progre&s;s in the philo&s;ophy of po|litics.
How few a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Cae&s;ar! How
in&s;tantly did Ma&s;&s;aniello effect his revo|lution!
One night completed the con|&s;piracy
of Fie&s;co; and Marius and Sylla
are immortal. Let us imitate the va&s;t
de&s;igns and &s;plendid deeds of great men.
In a cau&s;e like this the coward only is
avaricious of blood, and the fool only is
prodigal of words. A ma&s;&s;acre in politics
is an electric &s;hock; it calls forth a flame
from the colde&s;t bodies. I have joined
<PB N="265" REF="268">
in glorious ma&s;&s;acres. You mu&s;t want a
feeble conception of the &s;cene:&mdash;In the
&s;ilence and &s;hade of night, when the &s;till
air is almo&s;t heard, then like a &s;ummer
thunder &s;uddenly bur&s;ting from all parts,
&s;houts and groans, the &s;hrieks of women,
the cla&s;h of &s;words, the firing of pi&s;tols,
the lurid &s;kies now dark with &s;moke now
red with flame, &s;ome fugitive and others
pur&s;uing, the people now precipitating
and now precipitated, the &s;treets kennel|led
with blood, the pa&s;&s;age ob&s;tructed by
cor&s;es, and the exulting eye of a true
patriot glutted and tranquil amid bound|le&s;s
carnage: at &s;uch a moment, my
friends, every con&s;pirator is ardent with
triumph, while every citizen is frozen
with terror. I entered a church at Paris
with but a few friends; above five hun|dred
prie&s;ts had &s;ought an a&s;ylum; they
were chaunting Te Deum; when we en|tered
all their voices were united, but
<PB N="266" REF="269">
not one re&s;i&s;ted our daggers; we gradually
heard voice by voice decline, till only a &s;o|litary
accent &s;ounded in the hollow arches
of the church; we left him to his fate,
protected by the cor&s;es of five hundred of
his &s;laughtered companions. Believe me,
the arm of an active patriot does not tire.
Let men be a&s;&s;embled, and I a&s;k not a
minute to a man. You have heard of the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the Prince&s;s of Lamballe; I had
him over, but he has been &s;hipped off;
he was a ma&s;ter. The rich cannot fight,
and the poor will. Place a well-fed &s;pi|der
with one who has been fa&s;ting for ten
months; the meagre one attacks, ma&s;&s;a|cres,
and gorges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious fact (verifying the &s;ingular ab&s;ti|nence of &s;piders) has been lately given by Mr. Vail|lant, in his travels. He confined a &s;pider in a gla&s;s bottle during the &s;pace of ten months; it lived, but it's belly was dimini&s;hed to a point: he then in|troduced a &s;pider in vigour and condition. The &s;pider, which had undergone &s;uch a Turki&s;h rama|zan, gazed on the &s;tranger &s;ome time, and at length, alarm cea&s;ing with familiarity, he fraternized with him with all his claws, and the rich and corpulent &s;pider was &s;oon pulled to pieces by the meagre and fa|mi&s;hed fellow citizen.</NOTE>. Men are &s;piders in
<PB N="267" REF="270">
this re&s;pect. Not a town in England but
will ri&s;e. Will not the French fleets be
&s;afe in our ports?"</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider the winds, the winds," cried
Vaurien. "You are as &s;anguine as you
are &s;anguinary. You &s;urely are di&s;ea&s;ed
with a calenture, and imagine the &s;eas to
be green fields."</P>
<P>"Damn the winds!" retorted Dragon.
"Did not Mon&s;ieur Volney tell us, he
would manage them by this time? Are
we then to po&s;tpone a &s;alutary ma&s;&s;acre
for a N.W. or a N.E.? You then have
deceived me. I depended on the winds!"</P>
<P>"We cannot calculate the winds yet,"
ob&s;erved Subtile; "but there is an ex|i&s;ting
po&s;&s;ibility of this next year."</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="271">
"A&s;&s;uredly, or in ten thou&s;and years
hence," &s;aid Reverberator.</P>
<P>"Damn your gigantic &s;y&s;tem!" ex|claimed
Dragon; "you talk of ten thou|&s;and
years, and &s;uffer the exi&s;ting hour
to pa&s;s away unnoticed, unknown, and
unu&s;ed. Your whole life is reduced to
childhood."</P>
<P>"Nothing can be done with the Qua|kers,"
&s;aid Vaurien. "My project of an
univer&s;al peace charmed, but my mode
terrified. My &s;y&s;tem is, however, well
calculated. France, by it's extent and
it's populou&s;ne&s;s, can hold out a war
longer than any neighbouring country;
&s;o that when other nations are half de|&s;troyed,
it will retain a re&s;pectable and
&s;elect number of republicans. In our cal|culations
we look rather at the expence
of powder and ball than of men; we have
too many men, but are often in want of
ammunition. The genius of our new
<PB N="269" REF="272">
tactics is to fight ince&s;&s;antly by land,
and at &s;ea to board the enemy, that we
may relieve our&s;elves from the &s;uperfluity
of our men. To de&s;troy or be de&s;troyed
is the only &s;ecret of our art. A diurnal
war of twenty years is therefore de&s;irable.
I flatter my&s;elf two millions of our ene|mies
might be annually got rid of. At
the clo&s;e of the twenty years we &s;hould be
able to e&s;tabli&s;h, what hitherto has been
the clo&s;et dream of the philo&s;opher,&mdash;an
univer&s;al peace."</P>
<P>"Your calculation is commendable,"
replied Subtile; "but this general peace
greatly re&s;embles the peace of a church|yard.
It is a kind of peace which may
be already enjoyed in a de&s;ert. My pro|ject
is evidently &s;uperior. I would not
&s;laughter, but <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with men. What are
the cau&s;es or motives of war? Many in|deed
have been a&s;&s;igned, yet they are all
re&s;olvable into one; the propo&s;ed ad|vantage
<PB N="270" REF="273">
obtainable by a war. Now, of
advantages or di&s;advantages, no cri|terion
exi&s;ts but our conviction; it is,
therefore, a matter for argument. Na|tions
at pre&s;ent make war before they
negotiate; they &s;hould negotiate before
they make war. A war rarely produces
any real benefit to either party, but is
attended with inevitable evil to both.
At a peace the contending nations rejoice;
rather &s;hould they mourn; then only they
perceive them&s;elves placed amid&s;t ruins
and de&s;olations. A war has been often
kindled by a mi&s;term in a treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation is verified by a recent fact. Thomas Paine complains of a verbal inaccuracy of the American treaty with England, which might &s;erve for a &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e of a war. The treaty makes a conce&s;&s;ion to England to &s;eize provi&s;ions and <HI>other articles</HI> in American &s;hips. The term <HI>other articles,</HI> Thomas Paine affirms, includes <HI>all other ar|ticles whatever.</HI> He conceives the detection of as much importance as our philo&s;opher Subtile.</NOTE>: and
<PB N="271" REF="274">
thus al&s;o in law, which is another kind
of war. I was &s;aved at the Old Bailey,
becau&s;e the Attorney-general had mi&s;pelt
my name <HI>Subtile,</HI> by <HI>Subtle.</HI> A letter more
or le&s;s, a comma or a full &s;top, have fre|quently
di&s;turbed the peace of Europe.
I am of opinion that it is nece&s;&s;ary to
convince the world, that in&s;tead of armies
compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers, it &s;hould only form
them of correct grammarians and expert
logicians. Nations quarrel becau&s;e they
do not under&s;tand each other. Rea&s;on is
immutable; every ob&s;tacle is removed
by a lucid explanation. A treaty of war
would be more de&s;irable than a battle of
war. Who could re&s;i&s;t arguments &s;trong|ly
deduced, and grammar nicely correct?
There would be no mi&s;under&s;tandings,
for there would be no mi&s;terms."</P>
<P>"Grammer and rea&s;on!" exclaimed
Rant. "I give my vote of di&s;&s;ent in toto!
What would become of me and my works
<PB N="272" REF="275">
if grammer or rea&s;on were to be their cri|terions?
Cannon and gunpowder are as
nece&s;&s;ary as pen and ink."</P>
<P>"I am no great admirer, I confe&s;s, of
grammer and rea&s;on," &s;aid Reverberator.
"I have a natural antipathy to them;
for when I was an o&s;tler at Newmarket,
I ever ob&s;erved that certain anomalies in
the Engli&s;h language had the greate&s;t ef|fect
on my hor&s;es and my a&s;&s;ociates.
Some of our mo&s;t energetic expre&s;&s;ions
are both unrea&s;onable and ungramma|tical."</P>
<P>"Mr. Subtile is, however, ju&s;t in what
he &s;ays re&s;pecting grammar and rea&s;on,"
&s;aid Dr. Bounce; "for had the writer of
the fir&s;t chapter of Gene&s;is but known
either, he would not have u&s;ed the word
<HI>Elohim,</HI> which plural word, Gods, has
given to &s;ome a &s;trong proof of the exi&s;t|ence
of the Trinity, by which &s;o many
hone&s;t men like my&s;elf are kept out of
the hierarchy."</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="276">
"I &s;hould fear," &s;aid Vaurien, turning
to Subtile, "that your treaties of war,
to be conducted by logic, would be as
deceptive as our pre&s;ent treaties of peace;
for it &s;eems you can rea&s;on with equal
force on both &s;ides. You can, Mr. Re|verberator
informs me, prove that man is
a &s;tone, and then, that a &s;tone is not a

<P>"I can," replied Subtile, with an ex|ulting

No &s;tone is an animal; man is an animal;
ergo, man is not a &s;tone. Let beings, I
repeat, rational and intelligent, act with
rationality and intelligence, and I confi|dently

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A final Project of the Gaul. A Character
of the French Nation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Vaurien reflected on the in|determinations
of his &s;ecret com|mittees,
the imbecillity of his coadjutors,
and the evident &s;mallne&s;s of the number
of true republicans in this country, he
perceived that it was nece&s;&s;ary to congre|gate
men by other means than the pro|jects
hitherto pur&s;ued. After profound
meditation, he &s;ketched &s;everal plans
equally ingenious, and at length &s;elected
one which appeared to promi&s;e an univer|&s;al
confu&s;ion; to delight the young en|thu&s;ia&s;t
in his clo&s;et, the enlightened by
<PB N="276" REF="279">
honours rendered to &s;cience, the popu|lace
by the a&s;toni&s;hment of a new and
univer&s;al &s;en&s;ation, and the true republi|can
by enabling &s;uch to meet for mutual
&s;upport, and, like David, to "number
his people."</P>
<P>He now &s;at down to compo&s;e this
great work. He entitled it, "A Procla|mation,
in the name and authority of all
Nations," and he called him&s;elf, "Agent
General of all the Arts and Sciences."</P>
<P>It's de&s;ign was an exhortation addre&s;|&s;ed
to all the Engli&s;h, the Scotch, and the
Iri&s;h, to commemorate the birth, the
works, and the name of Newton. He
propo&s;ed that an act of parliament &s;hould
immediately decree a national edition of
his works; that his maje&s;ty &s;hould an|nually
go in &s;tate to Newton's printing
pre&s;s, and pay due homage to the art of
printing, as the emperor of China, to
reverence the art of agriculture, annually
<PB N="277" REF="280">
conducts the plough. That columns
&s;acred to Newton be erected in every
great town throughout the three &s;i&s;ter
kingdoms; that the name of Newton be
in&s;cribed among the princes of the royal
blood; that a new order of knighthood
be formed, called the Newtonian; that
his maje&s;ty &s;hould be&s;tow on "the agent
for all the arts and &s;ciences," the title of
"Sir Newton Vaurien;" that a Newtonian
fleet be prepared for new di&s;coveries in
every quarter of the world; and finally,
that the hou&s;e of the arch-philo&s;opher,
which, we do not blu&s;h to relate, is at
pre&s;ent converted into an eating-hou&s;e,
and eating is full as u&s;eful as philo&s;ophy,
&s;hould be rai&s;ed into a magnificent tem|ple,
his di&s;coveries to be &s;et to Handel's
mu&s;ic, and philo&s;ophical hymns to be
daily chanted to his memory throughout
the&s;e three kingdoms!</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281">
To defray the charges of this &s;ublime
project, he propo&s;ed that two guinea
&s;ub&s;criptions be depo&s;ited at his banker's,
and that any &s;urplus of money, after the
chop-hou&s;e had been rai&s;ed into a tem|ple,
be applied to the relief of the poor,
in the manner &s;o humanely recommended
by Dean Swift<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform mo&s;t of my readers, that this entire project has been publi&s;hed in London, la&s;t year. See "De par toutes les Nations," a book to be purcha&s;ed at Elm&s;ley's. The author is Mon&s;ieur De la Blancherie, who Madame Roland mentions among her numerous train of lovers; this circum&s;tance is creditable to his ta&s;te; whether it is to his politics I determine not. Mon&s;ieur De la Blancherie's intentions may be very innocent; all that I am informed is, that his zeal for the pre&s;ent project occa&s;ioned him to be threatened with the <HI>Alien Bill</HI>; but if he now re&s;ides in this country, it is an evidence of the ju&s;tice of our government, and the &s;implicity of his heart. I will venture to a&s;&s;ure this gentleman, that Newton is reverenced by Engli&s;hmen, not like <HI>true republicans,</HI> but <HI>hone&s;t men</HI>; not like <HI>boys,</HI> but <HI>&s;tudents:</HI> they read his works with the &s;ame calm and &s;low &s;agacity by which the Briton formed them. A great man requires no other monument than his works; their energy re|produces it&s;elf in a few kindred minds, and he is immortal becau&s;e he lives in others.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282">
Such is the literal analy&s;is of this ec|centric
project! a cool and rational Bri|ton
will in&s;tantly pronounce it the con|ception
of infanity, and that no political
mi&s;chief could attend any &s;imilar publi|cation;
as if great madmen were not to
the full as dangerous as great villains. If
Vaurien were mad, there was certainly
"a method in his madne&s;s;" but Vaurien
was in good health, although not in high
&s;pirits, when he compo&s;ed this great work.
It was a final project. Every exertion of
de&s;pair, if un&s;ucce&s;sful, is con&s;idered as
an act of lunacy, but attended with &s;uc|ce&s;s,
we then acknowledge it the &s;ub|lime
<PB N="280" REF="283">
invention of no ordinary genius.
This project cea&s;es to be an ab&s;urdity
when confronted with &s;ome of a kindred
character reali&s;ed in France. The re|moval
of the bones of Voltaire and Rou&s;|&s;eau,
carried with an idolatrous pomp to
the deification of a Pantheon, the na|tional
commemoration of a ferocious li|berty
by the exhibition of an allegorical
pantomime, and the national dre&s;&s;es,
motley and fanta&s;tical, in all forms and
all colours, were a&s;&s;uredly not extrava|gancies
of lunatics, but puerilites of de|&s;igning
men; puerile only in their ap|pearance,
invented to captivate the eye;
to plea&s;e the fancies of women, to awe
youth into re&s;pect, and to divert the
pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude into any chan|nel
of ob&s;ervation and conver&s;e, rather
than &s;uffer them to roll their turbid
waves amid&s;t the &s;ecreted fountain of
power. The <HI>infantes barbati,</HI> bearded in|fants,
<PB N="281" REF="284">
are to be u&s;ed as other boys, and
they give them harmle&s;s mockeries, that
they may not entertain them&s;elves by
&s;ei&s;ing on the dangerous in&s;truments of
men; but they will not permit the
children of nature to amu&s;e them&s;elves
with any other toys than tho&s;e manufac|tured
<HI>&agrave; la mode Pari&s;ienne.</HI></P>
<P>There was &s;agacity in this la&s;t attempt
of Vaurien. He had hitherto promi&s;ed
to his patron rapid wonders, which &s;hould
be followed by each other with undeviat|ing
and miraculous power. The Cardinal
De Rohan did not more revere the bu&s;t
of Caglio&s;tro, whom he con&s;idered as the
great <HI>illumin&eacute;</HI> of the age, than Lord Bel|field
confided in the head of Vaurien;
but the Gaul in every event had proved
the dupe of his own impetuous imagina|tion.
The fleets of France were di&s;per&s;ed,
were taken, and were burnt. The Iri&s;h
were loyal, and felt a Briti&s;h indignation
<PB N="282" REF="285">
at a Gallic ga&s;conade. The true repub|licans
in London were too few to enu|merate,
and too contemptible to li&s;ten
to. Bold, firm, and di&s;contented men
he found, but their audible di&s;content
proved the freedom of our country. He
&s;aw that our government felt all the in|firmities
of long admini&s;trations; no go|vernment
can reach a &s;tationary perfec|tion;
all were formed by human pa&s;|&s;ions,
and all are carried on by contend|ing
intere&s;ts; every government is good
which is &s;upportable. Vaurien &s;aw that
ours could not be as pure and vigorous
as in it's youth of 1688; it's &s;ound con|&s;titution
is rather debilitated by luxu|rious
ea&s;e, than imbecile by a pithle&s;s
and frigid age. He &s;aw our pre&s;s was
free, our juries were holy, our judges
hone&s;t; a mini&s;ter may be cen&s;ured and
impeached, and the voice of the people
can reach the throne; and the purity of
<PB N="283" REF="286">
our con&s;titution had been tried in it's
fountain head. Vaurien had &s;een with
&s;urpri&s;e, that a member, who profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf independent, could expel, when
he elevated his voice, a member who had
been &s;pawned forth from the filth of
commercial corruption.</P>
<P>He perceived the imbecility of the
chiefs of his party, who a&s;&s;umed the
&s;overeignty of human opinion, and one
of whom only had a ju&s;t claim to genius.
In vain the unfeeling, the &s;ophi&s;tical, and
the metaphy&s;ical Subtile had cho&s;en to
characteri&s;e free men, like herds of Yahoos;
in vain he had, with minute malice, and
hyperbolical calumny, arti&s;tly painted a
&s;ombrous and terrific picture, which he
cho&s;e to term the Engli&s;h con&s;titution;
in vain he had created a being with a
petrifaction for it's heart, ice-water for
it's blood, and clock-work for it's mo|tion,
which he cho&s;e to term a man.
<PB N="284" REF="287">
Still more in vain was Reverberator, the
noon-tide &s;hadow of this metaphy&s;ical
giant; his ten thou&s;and years could only
occa&s;ion the laugh, forgotten with the
moment. When Vaurien heard him af|firm
the wonderful influence of mind
over the exterior organization, and that
life might be prolonged at will, and
looked on this philo&s;opher of eternity, he
&s;miled to view a diminutive frame, a
&s;hrunken countenance, a man broken
down in the maturity of life, who&s;e volu|bility
was interrupted by an a&s;thma,
who&s;e vigour marched with tottering legs,
and who&s;e boldne&s;s trembled with &s;hat|tered
nerves. This Reverberator, who,
conceiving that all things were acquirable
by the per&s;erverance of habit, attempt|ed
in his walk to take large &s;trides, that
he might gradually make a gigantic &s;tep;
to dimini&s;h his food by &s;low gradations,
that in time he might exi&s;t with the
<PB N="285" REF="288">
lea&s;t, or po&s;&s;ibly without any food; and
on the &s;ame principle, &s;training and ema|ciating
his mind with his body, attempt|ed
to become a man of genius, by writ|ing
comedies without ta&s;te, poetry with|out
imagination, and politics in a rage.
From Sympathy he could expect little,
&s;ince although he was willing to overturn
all religion, he &s;till retained &s;o much of
the prie&s;t as to in&s;i&s;t on becoming an
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. For the re&s;t
of the &s;ociety, peace be to their manes!</P>
<P>Situated thus, de&s;olate in hope, and
active in de&s;pair, he publi&s;hed this eccen|tric
proclamation, and re&s;igned it to the
influence of chance; chance, to which &s;o
many great characters have had recour&s;e,
and which he knew, in the mo&s;t complicated
and ruinous game, &s;ometimes turns up
the dice which decides our fortune.</P>
<P>Vaurien had ill calculated the genius
of our nation. He had committed the
<PB N="286" REF="289">
error of his Pari&s;ian friends; they think
we re&s;emble them; that is, they con&s;ider
us as men much wor&s;e than we are.
They have examined &s;ome loo&s;e rotten
bricks which have fallen from the Briti&s;h
edifice, and decide on the wondrous
piles by &s;ome natural ca&s;ualties. In vain
we are told, that all men are the &s;ame
men. National characters are oppo&s;ite.
To moral, and not to phy&s;ical cau&s;es, can
be a&s;cribed that ho&s;tility of opinions,
which has, from age to age, removed, at
&s;o va&s;t an interval, the genius of the&s;e
neighbouring nations. The &s;ame winter
and &s;ummer refrigerate and heat Paris and
London, but not the &s;ame well-poi&s;ed
government and the &s;ame dome&s;tic vir|tues.
Ta&s;te, is a criterion of national cha|racter.
Voltaire never comprehended the
genius of Shake&s;peare; John&s;on never
ta&s;ted the ingenuity of Voltaire. An
Engli&s;h and French &s;tudent peru&s;e the
<PB N="287" REF="290">

<P>IT is now time to imitate the manner

of the &s;tate, as we have done, re|turns

<P>Emily with &s;ecret plea&s;ure now gazed
on Vaurien. She felt the &s;ame degree
of fa&s;cinated affection as Charles experi|enced.
Placed in a &s;imilar &s;ituation,
they mutually loved and hated. When
Emily li&s;tened to Lady Belfield, &s;he con|ceived
ideas of contempt; and to Vau|rien,
of confirmed horror relative to
Charles. Of the character of Mrs. Wil|&s;on
&s;he had received indubitable evi|dence.
<PB N="294" REF="297">
She and Charles felt alike; for
the innocence and purity of both were
the marked victims of the di&s;appointed
pa&s;&s;ion of her Lady&s;hip, and the cruel
malice of the Gaul. Yet it is worthy
of ob&s;ervation, that all the&s;e compli|cated
mi&s;chiefs were originally derived
from a young man's charity for a mi&s;era|ble
pro&s;titute!</P>
<P>Emily had &s;carcely re&s;ided a month with
Lady Belfield when &s;he found her depen|dent
life even more wretched than with
the daughter of the loan-contractor. The
beauty and di&s;&s;ipation of Mi&s;s Million by
no means rivalled tho&s;e of her Lady&s;hip;
and having been born in Pudding-lane,
&s;he was not &s;o expert and creative in her
derelictions from decency and virtue as
her rival, who had been born in Gro&s;ve|nor-&s;quare;
and yet we &s;hall not have
recour&s;e to <HI>climate</HI> to &s;olve this problem,
<PB N="295" REF="298">
as many other philo&s;ophers would. She
had not yet &s;eized on the natural genius
of di&s;&s;ipation; for it is by no means a
facile labour to become the mo&s;t aban|doned
and the mo&s;t amiable of women;
an experienced ta&s;te is required even in
the &s;election of impurities.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic manners of her Lady|&s;hip
were viewed with a &s;en&s;ation of horror.
A &s;tranger to her Lord, yet re&s;iding un|der
the &s;ame roof; when de&s;cribing
the embarra&s;&s;ments of their fortune, her
high play &s;he termed a national debt;
an avowed and criminal intercour&s;e with
her favourites was called a <HI>fleurette,</HI>
and with her claimants a &s;tamped re|ceipt.
Her private conver&s;ations alarmed
her hourly; for her Lady&s;hip, to give an
evidence of her friend&s;hip, threw off her
re&s;erve, and, like the Due&s;&s;a of Spen&s;er,
di&s;covered under the gay and brilliant
<PB N="296" REF="299">
dre&s;s by which &s;he enchanted the public
eye, a form of demoniac ugline&s;s and vi|cious
di&s;tortion.</P>
<P>In Vaurien Emily perceived nothing
but humanity and accompli&s;hment. He
too wore a beautiful ma&s;k; but art had
&s;o emulated nature, that if the innocent
Emily mi&s;took a ma&s;k for a face, others
of more experienced &s;agacity had been
alike deceived.</P>
<P>Sometimes when &s;he &s;at alone her
thoughts wandered to Charles; his image
had been placed on the altar of her heart,
and we do not readily break the idols which
we once have wor&s;hipped. Yet on Vau|rien
&s;he looked as on her protector, and fa|cilitated,
by the de&s;olation of her hopes
and the urgency of her wants, the de|&s;igns
he meditated.</P>
<P>In the mean while Vaurien perceived
the growing pa&s;&s;ion of his rival, who, in
the confidence of his friend&s;hip, con|fe&s;&s;ed

the re&s;tle&s;s emotions of his bo&s;om.
"To love her," &s;aid Charles, "who me|rits
not love, is a fa&s;cination. It is in
vain I combat and I re&s;olve; when her
image comes before me, every thought
turns to her; eternally I gaze on that in|tellectual
phantom which takes the pure
form without the impure mind of this
girl." Vaurien was alike convinced of
Emily's predilection for Charles; becau&s;e
not only he had caught her abrupt mo|nologue,
which we have given, at the
moment &s;he had di&s;covered the character
of Mrs. Wil&s;on, but al&s;o becau&s;e &s;he made
frequent enquiries concerning Charles,
and mourned over his character le&s;s with
the regret of di&s;plea&s;ure, than with the
grief of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Charles, although he would not enter
the hou&s;e of Belfield, was induced, by his
re&s;tle&s;s anxiety, to enquire concerning
Emily of her maid. By her he di&s;co|vered
that &s;he was far from being of con|genial
<PB N="298" REF="301">
di&s;po&s;itions with her Lady&s;hip,
with whom &s;he did not appear on the
ea&s;ie&s;t terms; that &s;he was melancholy,
and often had been ob&s;erved in tears.
The maid, however, confe&s;&s;ed that Emily
&s;eemed much delighted by the &s;ociety of
Vaurien, that &s;he often played to him on
her harp, that they pa&s;&s;ed hours in con|ver&s;ation,
and that &s;he con&s;ulted with
him on every pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. The in|terrupted
connection between her Lady|&s;hip
and Emily he attributed to the &s;pi|rit
of rivalry, while the latter part of the
information amply confirmed her charac|ter,
according to the de&s;criptions of his
friend Vaurien.</P>
<P>His agitated &s;pirits preyed on his
frame, and his health vi&s;ibly declined.
In his literary pur&s;uits he gave marks of
the di&s;traction of his mind; and &s;ome
&s;ingular blunders he had committed con|vinced
John&s;on that he concealed &s;ome
powerful emotion, too apparent in it's
<PB N="299" REF="302">
effects. He &s;aid to him one day, "My
good friend, I did not know you was the
ab&s;ent man; but you will ruin me. You
in&s;erted, I find, in Mr. Snowden's Tra|vels
to Ru&s;&s;ia, Mr. Fervid's de&s;cription
of his newly-di&s;covered i&s;land under the
Line; and you have &s;ent to the printer
of the Briti&s;h Critic, the article on the
aboli&s;hment of epi&s;copacy, which was
meant for the Critical Review, while
this month the Critical contains that
orthodox di&s;&s;ertation to prove the nature
of the Trinity on the principles of com|mon
&s;en&s;e. The literary world is in con|fu&s;ion.
The Rivingtons menace with
the pillory; the Robin&s;ons (who <HI>yet</HI> do
not command the pillory) threaten to
&s;tarve me out of employment. You
know that all the arts and &s;ciences, all
the wit and genius of the age, are ab|&s;olutely
under controul of the Rivingtons
and the Robin&s;ons, brothers and book|&s;ellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The former, publi&s;hers of the 'Briti&s;h Critic,' and the latter, of the 'Critical Review.' It is &s;up|po&s;ed that Me&s;&s;rs. Rivingtons occa&s;ionally write &s;ome of the Greek articles in the 'Briti&s;h Critic,' and that Me&s;&s;rs. Robin&s;ons write what articles they chu&s;e. I have no objection to <HI>their</HI> writing, and return thanks for many kind notices re&s;pecting my|&s;elf, which I will labour to merit; but I con&s;ider them as the Anthonies and Octavius's of the repub|lic of letters, and hope they will not treat me in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance as the great Cicero was treated, that is, after having been ma&s;&s;acred and mutilated, frag|ments of his cor&s;e were hung up in terrorem to the public eye. I de&s;ire therefore they would be careful of the <HI>extracts</HI> they make, which form the fragments of an author's dead body.</NOTE>." <PB N="300" REF="303">
Charles de&s;ired to relinqui&s;h
his pur&s;uits, acknowledged him&s;elf ab|&s;orbed
in a pa&s;&s;ion fatal to his repo&s;e,
that he loved an object who merited
not love, and now related the hi&s;tory of
Emily, which he had hitherto concealed.</P>
<P>John&s;on in&s;tantly in&s;inuated an idea,
<PB N="301" REF="304">
that Vaurien had been deceiving him re|&s;pecting
the character of Emily.</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" replied Charles. "Would
the man who with one hand has given me
the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;natch from me
with the other it's only enjoyment?"</P>
<P>John&s;on having received his promi&s;e
that he would never more touch another
manu&s;cript, a&s;&s;ured him that he would
&s;oon give him more certain evidence of
the artifice of the Gaul.</P>
<P>He &s;eized on the earlie&s;t opportunity
of conferring with Emily, and delighted
her, when &s;he was a&s;&s;ured that Charles
was virtuous and impa&s;&s;ioned.</P>
<P>"And whence," &s;he enquired, "his
&s;hamele&s;s connection with an abject be|ing?"</P>
<P>"Eccentric humanity! That being is
a virtuous woman. We mu&s;t learn to
correct our prejudices if we would not
<PB N="302" REF="305">
too frequently pierce with an added &s;ting
the bleeding bo&s;om of virtuous misfor|tune.
What &s;he related is true; but &s;he
could not relate all. Her mode&s;ty con|cealed
her incontinence." John&s;on related
her intere&s;ting connection with Charles.
When he had fini&s;hed, Emily rai&s;ed her
eyes to heaven, exclaiming, "My father,
once have you erred! Virtue, then, may
a&s;&s;ume a criminal appearance. Si&s;ter of
affliction! where does &s;he now wander?
Victim of prejudice and delicacy! I could
now embrace her with the confidence of
virtue. I could pre&s;s this woman, who
was a pro&s;titute, to my artle&s;s bo&s;om, as
an image of maternal affection. Tell Mr.
Charles he is an excellent young man; if
I cea&s;ed to e&s;teem him, the cau&s;e of that
ce&s;&s;ation will convince him that I now
mu&s;t e&s;teem him but the more."</P>
<P>"If you e&s;teem him," &s;aid John&s;on,
then have I an accu&s;ation again&s;t you.
<PB N="303" REF="306">
Charles knows that you are attached to
Vaurien, and take a vi&s;ible delight in his
&s;ociety."</P>
<P>"I am only born," replied Emily, "to
be deceived. Yes, Vaurien's accompli&s;h|ments
were eloquent, and his virtues were
&s;plendid. His character now becomes un|intelligible.
Is he then a villain?&mdash;Ah,
my father! are you again right? My
father, Sir, at his death, exhorted me to
'fly the agreeable.'&mdash;I &s;hould not then
have incurred this ju&s;t imputation."</P>
<P>"Your father," ob&s;erved John&s;on,
coun&s;elled you wi&s;ely; the agreeable ever
make an ea&s;y conque&s;t of your &s;ex."</P>
<P>When the&s;e my&s;teries were elucidated,
Vaurien di&s;covered them in Emily's coun|tenance
and conver&s;ation. She at length
accu&s;ed him of his ungenerous treatment
of Charles.</P>
<P>Vaurien pau&s;ed &s;ome minutes, then
rai&s;ing his hands, exclaimed with energy,
<PB N="304" REF="307">
&mdash;"I appeal to heaven that I am not
ungenerous! This man, and no doubt
this woman, even at this moment, exi&s;t
on my bounty! Since he provokes the
di&s;covery I have concealed, blame me not
for the confidence I have held religiou&s;ly
inviolate. I will &s;hew you his bond. All
this can be but a collu&s;ion of the wretch|ed
parties. As for this Charles he is no
where to be found; he has &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared."</P>
<P>He now &s;hewed Emily the bond, which
was for five hundred pounds; as &s;he
looked on it, mingled &s;en&s;ations agitated;
the generous concealment of Vaurien
waked a beaming plea&s;ure in her eyes;
the &s;ilence, the connections, and the flight
of Charles gave a poignant reproach to
her heart; her face burned with indigna|tion;
her eye &s;oftened with delight; the
amiable character of Vaurien ro&s;e to her
mind;&mdash;and when &s;he turned towards Vau|rien,
<PB N="305" REF="308">
&s;he gazed on an animated Adonis,
li&s;tened to tones that melodi&s;ed her &s;oul,
and was dazzled by eyes that melted with
their tendere&s;t fires. He threw him&s;elf
at her feet, confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her adorer,
and moaned in &s;uch de&s;pair at the treach|ery
and envy of Charles, that Emily, in
piteou&s;ly li&s;tening, &s;hed tears with the
tears of Vaurien.</P>
<P>This was one of tho&s;e moments of
activity with the Gaul, in which his
genius in&s;tantaneou&s;ly performed what
the &s;low conceptions of vulgar villains
could not have atchieved by repeated
deliberations. When he could force him|&s;elf
to re&s;i&s;t the overflowing &s;ympathy of
the artle&s;s Emily, he had Charles imme|diately
arre&s;ted, and by a weighty bribe
gained over his keeper to deliver to him
any letters he might write. This done, he
forged a letter to John&s;on, in Charles's
hand-writing. Vaurien was expert in coun|terfeiting
hand, and at Naples his inge|nuity
<PB N="306" REF="309">
had once nearly been rewarded by
having his hand &s;evered; but he had
timely decamped, pre&s;erving, with the in|&s;trument
of his art all it's former &s;kill.
In this letter to John&s;on Charles was made
to inform him, that he was compelled
to quit the kingdom in ha&s;te and trepi|dation;
that hitherto he had played the
hypocrite; that his attachment to Mrs.
Wil&s;on had been of a very ancient &s;tand|ing,
and had proved ruinous; and finally,
he de&s;ired John&s;on would call on Vaurien,
to thank him for the con&s;iderable &s;um he
owed him, but which he could never
repay.</P>
<P>John&s;on read the letter with &s;ilent a&s;to|ni&s;hment.
He examined and re-exa|mined.
Charles did not appear, and every
letter was evidently of his writing. He
ha&s;tened to Vaurien and Emily; each
&s;hared in the &s;ame a&s;toni&s;hment. John|&s;on,
who&s;e &s;u&s;picion had not entirely de|&s;erted
<PB N="307" REF="310">
him, &s;crupulou&s;ly examined the
countenance of Vaurien; never man ap|peared
more poignantly afflicted. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed
little, and &s;carcely were his words
audible; a tear trickled on his cheek;
he wrung his hands; he looked &s;ometimes
on Emily, and &s;ometimes on John&s;on,
&s;hook his head, and groaned.</P>
<P>When John&s;on was quitting the hou&s;e,
he heard of &s;o many of Vaurien's liberali|ties
to the dome&s;tics, that his &s;pontane|ous
loan to Charles cea&s;ed to be extraor|dinary.
William told him, that had it
not been for Vaurien he &s;hould not have
known what had become of his father's
&s;oul, &s;ince without his genero&s;ity it had
never re&s;ted in church ground. A collec|tion
of mendicants was waiting at the
door to receive Vaurien's weekly &s;tipend.
This man, thought John&s;on, mu&s;t be
what he &s;eems, and my national preju|dices
have injured him.</P>

<P>THUS were affairs &s;ituated at the time
Vaurien's Newtonian &s;y&s;tem was pub|li&s;hed.
Charles in pri&s;on was as melan|choly
as Jeremiah, forming lamentations
on modern friend&s;hips; and this Pythias
conceived him&s;elf betrayed by one Da|mon,
and de&s;erted by another. Vaurien
perceived that the compa&s;s of his fate
was clo&s;ing the circle it de&s;cribed, and
that the commemoration of Newton's
&s;ame &s;eemed to be left entirely to the
planetary &s;y&s;tem he had formed, and that
he, who had in&s;cribed his works on the
face of heaven mu&s;t regard with a &s;mile
the earthly celebrations of mortality.
<PB N="309" REF="312">
Some friends of Lord Belfield had in|formed
his Lord&s;hip, that he had en|tertained
a dangerous adventurer; that
among the privileges of nobility was not
accounted that of an exemption from
impeachment; and, be&s;ides, they a&s;&s;ured
his Lord&s;hip, that his phy&s;icians were of
opinion that a change of climate was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his health. His
Lord&s;hip, indeed, was of the &s;ame opi|nion,
not in re&s;pect to his health, which
he affirmed was vigorous, but to his af|fairs,
which he acknowledged were di&s;or|dered;
and the voice of a creditor is as awe|ful
as that of a phy&s;ician; they both con|vince
the patient that he can expect no
quiet unle&s;s he &s;lies from their regular
attendance.</P>
<P>Vaurien had now fixed the bias in the
&s;en&s;itive heart of Emily, and he was anti|cipating
the moment of her fall. He had
con&s;ulted with Lady Belfield, and the
<PB N="310" REF="313">
boudoir of her lady&s;hip had been &s;elcted
as the altar on which the virgin victim
was to bleed.</P>
<P>The great events of great men are go|verned
by the &s;ame capricious influence
which directs the little events of little
men. The web of fate is woven by the
hand of fortune, and &s;he, indu&s;trious
yet indi&s;criminate &s;pin&s;ter, takes the ca|&s;ual
ball from her ba&s;ket, and carele&s;s
works, now with threads of gold, and now
with damaged yarn. She weaves on our
fate, but makes no di&s;tinction of per|&s;onages.
The hero frequently envies the
bandit; for often the latter has found his
exi&s;tence to be a triumph over innocence,
while the former has peri&s;hed in the act
of his inju&s;tice. Every thing in this
world &s;eems good or ill fortune, and the
events of fortune are &s;u&s;pended on the
&s;lighte&s;t accidents; a plank immerges the
<PB N="311" REF="314">
con&s;pirator into &s;eas, &s;tormy and profound
as his de&s;igns, in the hour of exultation,
and a pebble is &s;lung into the head of
the giant in the hour of confidence.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield was bitterly reproaching
Vaurien for his abortive and va&s;t de&s;igns.
He had at length di&s;covered that he was
a fertile tree, luxuriant in leaves, but void
of fruit; and complained much in the
&s;tyle which a ruined lover of alchymy
would formerly have employed to &s;ome
beggarly gold-maker, who had promi&s;ed
to roof and floor his apartments in the
Mexican fa&s;hion, before the Spaniards ar|rived;
but after the multifarious indu&s;|try
of years, lo! a furnace had bur&s;t with
a terrible explo&s;ion, or at the very cri&s;is,
the <HI>aurum potabile</HI> in the crucible was
whi&s;ked down by a cat's tail. Great or
little cau&s;es, Vaurien averred, had hi|therto
fru&s;trated his comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;|tem.
While they were computing, like
<PB N="312" REF="315">
two Subtiles, what is evidence and what
is only equivalent to evidence, intelligence
was brought, that Me&s;&s;rs. Dragon and
Rant were arre&s;ted for high-trea&s;on; a
quarter of an hour afterwards Mon&s;ieur
Vaurien received a note of epigrammatic
conci&s;ene&s;s from Mr. Dundas, without a
&s;cottici&s;m or a vulgari&s;m. It there ap|peared,
that this ho&s;pitable country di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
the Gaul, and in twenty-four hours
were the &s;eas to receive Vaurien. A
breathle&s;s friend ru&s;hed in, to intreat his
Lord&s;hip to &s;et off in&s;tantly on his tour
through Europe. "Your government
(ob&s;erved Vaurien) are adopting Subtile's
&s;y&s;tem of puni&s;hment; it makes us all
travellers. I have long been one. To
me the chances and the changes of for|tune
have by cu&s;tom an uniformity in
their varieties. My chimerical head has
con&s;idered Europe as the inheritance of
every &s;ublime politician in the&s;e periods
<PB N="313" REF="316">
of revolution; but I fear that my &s;hadow
will ever be reflected on the earth of my
neighbours, and never on my own."</P>
<P>Vaurien was collected and intrepid,
and he would have been equally &s;o had
the letter of Dundas been his Maje&s;ty's
order, &s;igned for his execution. Mithri|dates
and Hannibal carried about them
an antidote again&s;t poi&s;on; and had Vau|rien
been now in modern Italy, he would
have continued the precaution which the&s;e
great men u&s;ed in ancient Italy; but in
the&s;e northern climates he knew we only
poi&s;oned rats. What communicated this
intrepidity to the Gaul, was a per&s;ua&s;ion
that he was born to &s;uffer a public death.
What is inevitable, to a &s;uperior mind
conveys no terror. Whether the philo&s;o|pher
was to be hanged, guillotined, be|headed,
broken on the wheel, or empaled,
he knew not, the mode entirely depend|ing
<PB N="314" REF="317">
on the cu&s;toms of that country where
he was to make his final exit.</P>
<P>"<HI>Eh, bien!</HI> (thought Vaurien, as he
was filling his portmanteau) the liberty
of the&s;e Britons is like a bottle of their
Port, locked in a gla&s;s beaufet; they &s;ee
it, and there it is&mdash;but only ta&s;te it at
the option of their ma&s;ter, who keeps the
key at his own di&s;po&s;al. Their liberty
will not intoxicate their heads. Here
the people &s;ubmit to the laws&mdash;damned fools!&mdash;the laws mu&s;t be &s;ub|mitted
to the people&mdash;there &s;hould be NO
LAWS at all, as Subtile &s;ays, and then, if
there were no laws, every thing would be
lawful.</P>
<P>"<HI>Diable!</HI> (he exclaimed, as he lifted
his portmanteau) I carry nothing away
from this opulent country. I play my
cards ill. After all my &s;hooting parties
with that &s;chool-boy of Naples, he would
<PB N="315" REF="318">
have &s;poiled my hand-writing for the for|gery
on the Trea&s;ury. Spain I lo&s;t by
tho&s;e garlick-dige&s;ting grandees, becau&s;e
I de&s;ired to curtail their names. I mi&s;|took
the real number of my confederates
when I looked over my papers; as they
appeared in writing, I imagined every
&s;ingle man to be at lea&s;t &s;ix. I thought
I had an entire family when I di&s;covered
I had only a hot-brained boy. The Pru&s;&s;ian
idiot I had per&s;uaded, for I knew it would
win him, that he was an <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> an <HI>illu|min&eacute;</HI>;
I u&s;ed to tread on his feet, and then
entreat his pardon for my not being able to
&s;ee him. All my party did the &s;ame; his
Maje&s;ty was buffetted about the whole
day, which quite flattered his powers of
<HI>invi&s;ibility.</HI> The court of Berlin had been
our's, but for the mini&s;ter, who, while he
received Engli&s;h money, per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;|&s;uring
his Maje&s;ty that we were im|po&s;tors,
and that his palpable obe&s;ity was
<PB N="316" REF="319">
not of &s;o &s;piritual a kind, as ever to e&s;|cape
the eye. Rome had been mine,
but for tho&s;e Cardinals who call them|&s;elves
<HI>nephews</HI> of the Pope; but I found
that they were more accurate in calling
him their holy <HI>father.</HI> The Ottoman and
the Ru&s;&s;ian empires are fair and open
fields; but they are too di&s;tant for the
moment. In America I have friends at
work, who will burn the place if they do
not &s;ucceed. There is no room for me.
I do not chu&s;e to be a hermit amid a
hundred thou&s;and acres. The Dutch are
near&mdash;&s;anguinary and unfeeling I knew
the boors were; but little imagined that
tho&s;e unwieldly porpoi&s;es, &s;leeping in &s;tag|nated
water, &s;hould ever leap out to frolic
with uncouth airine&s;s to the national tune
of the Mar&s;eillois hymn.</P>
<P>"But, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Emily I have
mi&s;&s;ed for a &s;ingle day! A kingdom I
can always di&s;cover, but a child of love
<PB N="317" REF="320">
and nature kingdoms may not pre&s;ent.
Charles remains in pri&s;on. From either
I derive no further benefit, and I wi&s;h no

pen, and addre&s;&s;ed the following letter to
Emily.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Admirable Emily!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When you receive this letter, Vau|rien
is on the &s;eas. Here my projects
are concluded, and the &s;ole pa&s;&s;ion that
now occupies my thoughts is my bene|volence.</P>
<P>You have e&s;caped, &s;weet bird of
love! but in the depths of night the
lights were placed, and the net Lady
Belfield and my&s;elf have long woven
was at this moment to have clo&s;ed on
you. Child of nature, and woman of
beauty! your un&s;u&s;picious innocence was
the magic that attracted, and the magic
<PB N="318" REF="321">
that would have precipitated your ruin.
I have already proved &s;eductive to your
mind; and the mind of an accompli&s;hed
woman (a mere creature made up of ima|gination
and &s;en&s;ibility) when once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
is &s;ecuring a party in the fortre&s;s,
who will &s;oon be too &s;trong for any oppo|&s;ition
at the outworks.</P>
<P>Nature has been prodigal to me,
but art has even exceeded her liberalities.
Had I lived in England, I had rendered
you the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of your &s;ex; but
&s;ince I am bani&s;hed from it, I will render
you the mo&s;t happy.</P>
<P>All that I have in&s;inuated relative to
Charles and Mrs. Wil&s;on is a foul inven|tion
of too common a kind to have co&s;t
me any difficulty. Dome&s;tic trea&s;ons are
beneath me; it is only national trea&s;ons
which I feel as my genius, and con&s;ider
as my glory. My dear girl, in this head
of mine revolve all the cabinet &s;ecrets of
<PB N="319" REF="322">
Europe; Monarchs I have deceived,
Dukes I have ruined, and Mini&s;ters I
have embarra&s;&s;ed. You now perceive
I claim no merit in having deluded a
country lad and la&s;s.</P>
<P>Are you not &s;urpri&s;ed at my <HI>gaiet&eacute; de
coeur?</HI> What, you conceive me at this
moment, immer&s;ed in thought, and con|founded
by di&s;appointment! It is pre|ci&s;ely
at moments like this, when I am
engaged in no particular project, that,
free from politics, I feel my&s;elf, and act
the man. With you I have ever been
&s;erious and &s;entimental; yet, could you
have <HI>then</HI> li&s;tened to my conver&s;ations
with her Lady&s;hip, if your eyes had had
intelligence, I a&s;&s;ure you our faces were too
frequently mo&s;t impolitical; but I tru&s;ted
in your boundle&s;s &s;implicity, as you confi|ded
in my boundle&s;s art. You have there|fore
no conception of my character. You

was ruining all my &s;chemes, I re&s;olved
to deceive that &s;tern and &s;u&s;picious An|glican.
Some little merit was in that de|ception,
for it required my bolde&s;t ex|ertion.
When I quitted you I arre&s;ted
Charles; I had lent him the money that
<PB N="321" REF="324">
I might command him at all times, well
knowing he could never repay me. I forged
the letter which John&s;on received. All
Charles's letters were delivered to me.
The &s;imple youth is at this moment moan|ing
over the perfidy of modern friend|&s;hips,
and the coquetry of modern
loves.</P>
<P>I am not now rich, yet I can be ge|nerous.
There are human &s;harks, or Lon|don
cannibals, who would give money
for any legal in&s;trument. A bond, you
may tell Charles, is no trifle; he &s;igned
it as carele&s;sly as if it had been a private
memorandum; it is a public one. With
this you receive it; take it your&s;elf to
him in the Fleet. Let him receive his
freedom and his fortune from the hand
he adores. I wi&s;h it had been more, for
it was not money of mine. Let him po&s;|&s;e&s;s
his Emily; yet I write the words with
a pang in my heart. Shew him this
<PB N="322" REF="325">
letter, and let it's &s;ecrets peri&s;h between
you. There a&s;&s;ure him that his Emily is
a precious ca&s;ket, who&s;e gems have been
unrifled, although a robber had already
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fal&s;e key. Hundreds like
your&s;elves I have injured; many an hone&s;t
Charles I have met, but never in &s;o &s;oft
a form, a &s;oul more cha&s;te, and a mind
more exqui&s;ite.&mdash;Adorable Emily! you
are &s;omething more than woman, and yet
are all woman; &s;omething that the ima|gination
gazes on with delight, yet awe;
ta&s;te is &s;ilent when it would de&s;cribe you,
and in memory only you are viewed with
your &s;ingular excellence.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Will either of you forget VAURIEN?</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having &s;ealed this letter, the Gaul took
his departure in a neutral ve&s;&s;el for Hol|land,
and ere he reached it's &s;hores al|ready
meditated a new government for
<PB N="323" REF="326">
that ruined people; his &s;peculations re|ceived
con&s;iderable enlargement from &s;e|veral
patriots, and two or three philo&s;o|phers,
his <HI>compagnons de voiage,</HI> who with
him were taking the benefit of the Alien
Bill; patriots and philo&s;ophers, whom the
o'erpre&s;&s;ed &s;tomach of England had di&s;|gorged
with a violent, but a &s;alutary
effort.</P>
