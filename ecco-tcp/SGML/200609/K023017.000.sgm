<HEAD>A CLUE to the
COMEDY
OF THE
NON-JUROR,
With &s;ome Hints of Con&s;equence
relating to that PLAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Entirely agree with
you, That there has
not of late appear'd
in Publick, a more
<HI>exqui&s;ite Piece of Sa|tire,</HI>
than the Come|dy
call'd the <HI>Non-juror;</HI>
or that better de&s;erv'd the
<PB N="6" REF="4">
Di&s;tinction that was &s;hown it, not
only by your Self, as His Maje&s;ty's
Laureat, but by all the Loyal Party in
general. I al&s;o agree with you, that
perhaps there never was a Piece of fine
<HI>Drama-Theological Satire,</HI> the true Scope
of which has been le&s;s under&s;tood. I
am at a Lo&s;s which to admire mo&s;t,
the noble, free Spirit of our Friend the
Author; the in&s;en&s;ibility of tho&s;e whom
the Satire is <HI>really Aim'd at,</HI> or the igno|rant
Rage of tho&s;e <HI>di&s;&s;affected Jacobite
Wretches</HI> who cry out when they are not
hurt. You were pleas'd to de&s;ire me,
when we met la&s;t, to put upon Paper
the few Hints I dropt to you in Con|ver&s;ation
upon this Subject, and which,
I doubt not, are &s;ufficient to make any
unprejudic'd Re~ader of your and my
Opinion; namely,</P>
<P>That Di&s;&s;affection to the Govern|ment
is the &s;malle&s;t Immorality which
is pointed at by this Play; and which
indeed is only introduced to hide a far
<HI>deeper De&s;ign,</HI> and far <HI>more u&s;eful Satire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">
In order to &s;et this in it's true Light,
I will but barely <HI>point</HI> at the &s;everal Fi|gures
of the Comedy, and make &s;ome
&s;hort Remarks upon their Attitudes,
without the Ill-manners of naming any
particular Per&s;on, but leaving the free
and impartial Reader to draw his own
Inferences. Two general Ob&s;ervations
only, are nece&s;&s;ary to be premi&s;ed, be|cau&s;e
every common Judge is not &s;o
&s;en&s;ible of them, as we who have been
Writers all our Lives.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, That when we <HI>Rebuke
our Superiours,</HI> the Fable ought to be &s;o
coucn'd, as to make the Criminal give
Judgment again&s;t him&s;elf before he is
aware: (an Art as ancient at lea&s;t as the
Days of <HI>Nathan)</HI> But if the Scene of
Action be laid in a Subject not only
quite <HI>foreign,</HI> but &s;eemingly <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> to
the principal Aim of the Satire, the
Addre&s;s will be &s;till the more refined;
becau&s;e by this Method the Author in|troduceth
<HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Per&s;onages</HI> which the
guilty will be &s;ure to Condemn; not
only from <HI>natural Equity,</HI> but <HI>natural
<PB N="8" REF="6">
Aver&s;ion.</HI> Thus, for Example, To en|gage
a <HI>Tory</HI> to condemn a Piece of Ini|quity
in the Ab&s;tract, one need only lay
the Scene among <HI>Whigs,</HI> and &s;o on the
contrary. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> I would put
the Reader in mind that in Fables of
this Nature, it is u&s;ual to repre&s;ent <HI>whole
Parties of Men by &s;ingle Per&s;onages.</HI></P>
<P>This premi&s;ed, let us ob&s;erve the
principal Figure thar pre&s;ents it &s;elf to
our View; I mean Dr. <HI>Wolf;</HI> who&s;e
Character an&s;wers to <HI>Moliere</HI>'s <HI>Tartuffe,</HI>
who is known to have repre&s;ented a
<HI>certain puritanical Bi&s;hop in France.</HI></P>
<P>We next are to take Notice, That
<HI>Wolf</HI> in the Stile of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Allegory</HI>
con&s;tantly &s;ignifies the <HI>Presbyterian Party:</HI>
You know it is thus in the <HI>Hind</HI> and
<HI>Panther,</HI> and mo&s;t other Pieces of Con|trover&s;ial
Divinity or Poetry. So Dr.
<HI>Wolf</HI> is a <HI>Presbyterian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>expects for his Services in</HI>
Betraying the Church, <HI>great</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
<PB N="9" REF="7">
Preferment, <HI>(as Sir</HI> John <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;eth
it)</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Nonju|ror, pag. 18.</NOTE> an Office for Life,
which, on what&s;oever Pretence of
Misbehaviour, no Civil Government
can deprive him of. <HI>This is Ironi|cally
repre&s;ented afterwards by the</HI>
See of Thetford. <HI>So, in &s;hort,
Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>is a Bi&s;hop.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bi&s;hop has
wrote &s;omething about the <HI>Ca&s;e of
Schi&s;m;</HI> and the <HI>Colonel</HI> tells his
Father, <HI>That he</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">pag. 3.</NOTE> <HI>has read enough
of him in the</HI> Daily Courant.
What Bi&s;hop has publi&s;h'd in the
<HI>Daily Courant,</HI> is <HI>lippis et ton&s;oribus
notum.</HI></P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop prote&s;ts great Zeal
for the <HI>Church,</HI> at the &s;ame Time
that he is betraying it: On which
the <HI>Colonel</HI> tells Sir <HI>John, Tho'</HI><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">pag. 3.</NOTE>
<HI>I have always honour'd your Concern
<PB N="10" REF="8">
for the Church, I little thought it
was for a Church that is E&s;tabli&s;h'd
no where.</HI> (i. e.) <HI>No vi&s;ible Church.</HI></P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop is mark'd with
another &s;trong Characteri&s;tick,
managing a Di&s;pute with <HI>Heartly</HI>
about <HI>the Nature of Prayer.</HI> That
it ought not to be <HI>Tedious;</HI><NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">pag. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>outward Expre&s;&s;ion not &s;o ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince Heaven knew the
true Intention of the Heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">pag. 12.</NOTE> And
then he talks of his own <HI>Manual
of Devotions.</HI></P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop al&s;o pretends a
mighty Regard to <HI>tender Con&s;cien|ces.</HI>
He tell's <HI>Heartly,</HI> That we
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">pag. 13.</NOTE><HI>ought to allure them to what is
Good by the gentle&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t Means
we can,</HI> nor give the lea&s;t colour
of Offence to tender Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9">
<HI>The</HI> Colonel <HI>here urges the</HI> Con|&s;titution
<HI>again&s;t him, and the force
of the Laws; and de&s;ires him to
explain him&s;elf; to which this
Bi&s;hop An&s;wers</HI><NOTE N="6" PLACE="marg">pag. 13</NOTE><HI>Sir,</HI> I &s;hall not

your mind, as I do; <HI>viz.</HI> That there
may come a Time when this Con&s;ti|tution
you talk &s;o much of, may be
overturned.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> is fully &s;atisfy'd that
the <HI>Doctor</HI> is all this while a<NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">pag. 18.</NOTE>
<HI>true &s;tanch Member of the</HI> Engli&s;h
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> mark, that is,
&s;uch a Church as <HI>comprehends all
Sects and Parties what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10">
But le&s;t the&s;e Lines &s;hou'd not
be &s;trong enough, the Author
gives the fini&s;hing Stroke.</P>
<P>This Bi&s;hop is at la&s;t di&s;co|ver'd
to be a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> in Di&s;gui&s;e,
By whom? By one of his <HI>School-Boys</HI>
in whom he had di&s;tilled.
&s;ome of his <HI>Je&s;uitical Principles</HI>
And mo&s;t remarkable it is what
the <HI>Colonel</HI> &s;ays on this Occa&s;ion.
That<NOTE N="8" PLACE="marg">pag. 47.</NOTE><HI>Charles</HI> begs <HI>he will not
in&s;i&s;t upon the Di&s;covery, 'till his
Circum&s;tances will allow it:</HI> Almo&s;t
in the very Stile of &s;ome <HI>Letters</HI>
that pa&s;&s;ed, upon a parallel Oc|ca&s;ion,
between a <HI>Ma&s;ter of a
School,</HI> and a <HI>Reverend Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t <HI>Sub&s;tantial Affadavits</HI>
are produced, to prove Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>
to have been Educated a <HI>Je&s;uit;</HI>
by which (as it is u&s;ual in Alle|gorical
Writers) <HI>the clo&s;e Conjun|ction
<PB N="13" REF="11">
of a Reverend</HI> Prelate <HI>and a
certain</HI> Je&s;uit, is mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly
and &s;candalou&s;ly in&s;inuated.</P>
<P>So here is a <HI>Prelate</HI> and a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI>
and his <HI>Gang,</HI> got into the Family
of Sir <HI>John!</HI> Let us next &s;ee
what they are to do there. Why,
they contrive the <HI>Ruin</HI> of his Fa|mily,
and the <HI>di&s;inheriting</HI> and
<HI>expul&s;ion</HI> of his <HI>Children</HI> with &s;o
great an A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s, that
the <HI>Doctor</HI> talks of Sir <HI>John</HI> in
this manner:<NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg">pag. 68.</NOTE><HI>Poor Man! he
knows not his own Weakne&s;s; he is
moulded into any Shape, if you but
gently &s;troke his Humour. I intend
to Morrow, to per&s;wade him 'tis for
the Intere&s;t of our Cau&s;e it &s;hould be
&s;o; and then I have him &s;ure.</HI> Poor
Sir <HI>John</HI> indeed!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">
I mu&s;t here put you in mind
of my &s;econd Ob&s;ervation, that
by the &s;ingle Per&s;on of Dr. <HI>Wolf,</HI>
without any forced Con&s;truction,
may be under&s;tood a whole Sett
or Party of Men. To proceed
then,</P>
<P>The Play Opens with a Di&s;|pute
between Sir <HI>John</HI> and his
<HI>Daughter,</HI> about the Formality of
<HI>Chri&s;tening,</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI> is at it
again, <HI>(pag</HI> 63) being extremely
rejoyced that <HI>Heartly</HI> is <HI>Chri&s;t'ned</HI>
according to the <HI>Right Form.</HI>
There is al&s;o mention made of
<HI>Searching the Regi&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Next we &s;ee Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>in&s;ulting
Sir</HI> John'<HI>s</HI> Son <HI>and</HI> Daughter; <HI>he
breaks into the</HI> Daughter's <HI>Bed|chamber
before &s;he is quite</HI> Up;
<HI>and when</HI> &s;he re&s;ents it, <HI>he tell's
her</HI><NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">pag. 15.</NOTE> Compo&s;e your Tran&s;port,
<PB N="15" REF="13">
Madam: I came by your <HI>Father's
De&s;ire;</HI> for what I have done,
Madam, I had your <HI>Father's Au|thority,</HI>

you. <HI>The</HI> Daughter <HI>replies,</HI>
<NOTE N="11" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>It is fal&s;e, he gave you no
Authority to in&s;ult me: What is it

does that exempt you from the Man|ners

<P>At la&s;t his foul Behaviour pro|vokes
the <HI>Son</HI> to that degree, that
he call's him<NOTE N="12" PLACE="marg">pag. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Villain,</HI> and
<HI>Ra&s;cal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir</HI> John <HI>is nettled at this; he
tells his</HI> Son <HI>and</HI> Daughter,<NOTE N="13" PLACE="marg">pag. 44.</NOTE>
I &s;ee your Aim: Your Malice on
your own vile Head: To me it
but the more endears him: Either
&s;ubmit and <HI>ask his Pardon</HI> for this
Wrong,&mdash;or this In&s;tant <HI>leave

<P><HI>The</HI> Son <HI>an&s;wers,</HI><NOTE N="14" PLACE="marg">pag. 45.</NOTE> Tho' I
would hazard Life to &s;ave you from
the Ruin he mi&s;leads you to, could
Die to Reconcile my Duty to your
Favour; yet on the Terms that Vil|lain
offers, 'tis Merit to refu&s;e it.
I Glory in the Di&s;grace your Errors
give me.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Attachment
to Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> was &s;o great, that
there appear'd but &s;mall Hopes of
ever opening Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Eyes:
And remarkable is the Lamenta|tion
of the <HI>Son</HI> upon that Occa|&s;ion;<NOTE N="15" PLACE="marg">pag. 16.</NOTE>
<HI>What horrid Hands is
this poor Family fall'n into? How
little is my Father like him&s;elf, by
Nature Open, Ju&s;t, and Generous?
but this vile Hypocrite drives his
weak Pa&s;&s;ions like the Wind; and I
<PB N="17" REF="15">
fore&s;ee, at la&s;t, will da&s;h him on his
Ruin.</HI></P>
<P>When Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> had wrought
up the Pa&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>John</HI> to this
degree, as to turn his <HI>Children out
of Doors;</HI> then he interpo&s;eth his
good Offices, and propo&s;eth a
<HI>Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>I beg the Reader to ob&s;erve
the <HI>Terms</HI> of it. <HI>That his Child
&s;hould be at the &s;ole Di&s;po&s;al of Dr.</HI>
Wolf, and do nothing without
<HI>his Con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t here be ob&s;erv'd that
the Daughter had a Fortune of <HI>her
own, independent on the Father,</HI> upon
which &s;he &s;eems to value her Self.
<NOTE N="17" PLACE="marg">pag. 5.</NOTE><HI>Have not I</HI> 5000l. <HI>in my own
hands? have not I had the full Swing
of my own Airs and humours the&s;e
four years?</HI> Mark the preci&s;e
time But &s;he is put in mind by
<PB N="18" REF="16">
the <HI>Son,</HI> that tho' the Father
could not <HI>deprive her of her Fortune,
he might abridge</HI> her Equipage; in
the&s;e words<NOTE N="18" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE><HI>however a Father's
Con&s;ent might have clapt a pair of
hor&s;es more to your Coach.</HI></P>
<P>But at la&s;t he applauds her re|&s;olution,
and tells her &s;he <HI>&s;peaks
with the Spirit of a free-born Engli&s;h|man.</HI></P>
<P>Mark now the mode&s;ty of
Dr. <HI>Wolf;</HI> he propo&s;es, as the
Lowe&s;t and <HI>la&s;t condition, that &s;he
&s;hould re&s;ign the half of this indepen|dent
fortune</HI><NOTE N="19" PLACE="marg">pag. 54.</NOTE><HI>Is not two thou&s;and
pounds worth two Thou&s;and pounds?</HI>
Is not <HI>half</HI> better than <HI>nothing?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17">
Ob&s;erve next, (good Mr.
<HI>Rowe)</HI> how Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> endea|vours
to debauch Lady <HI>Woodvill,</HI>
and make her Sub&s;ervient to his
Villainous de&s;igns: This Lady
is de&s;cribed as having a great A&s;|cendant
over Sir <HI>John's</HI> Spirit that
<HI>She keeps no A&s;&s;emblys;</HI> that &s;he
had been <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Beautiful,</HI> while
Sir <HI>John</HI> was <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Amourous.</HI>
This Lady proves hone&s;t and
tru&s;ty; and contributes, in the
conclu&s;ion, to the di&s;covery of
the wicked purpo&s;es of Dr.
<HI>Wolf.</HI></P>
<P>Pray take notice too of a very
odd Epi&s;ode that &s;eem to contri|bute
very little to the main
Action. That is Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>'s en|deavouring
to Bring Sir <HI>John</HI> in|to
a <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Church Comprehen&s;i|on;</HI>
Referring again to his <HI>Ca&s;e of
Schi&s;m,</HI> he tells Sir <HI>John</HI> that<NOTE N="20" PLACE="marg">pag. 25</NOTE>
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<HI>differences are not &s;o material as
&s;ome would repre&s;ent them. Ah!
could we be brought to a Temper,
a great many &s;eeming Contradictions
might be reconciled.</HI> I allow this is a
<HI>Comprehen&s;ion</HI> of a different kind;
but I beg leave to remind you
and my Readers of my fir&s;t ob&s;er|vation,
that the <HI>Circum&s;tances of a
Fable</HI> do not determine the <HI>Satire.</HI>
But you, Sir, who are intimate
with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> may examine and
know the Truth of this.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o plain as the
Cata&s;trophe; when Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>
thought him&s;elf &s;ure of his Blow,
and had brought Sir <HI>John</HI> to be|lieve
that his<NOTE N="21" PLACE="marg">pag. 24.</NOTE><HI>hot brain'd</HI> Son
(as he calls him) had a De&s;ign to
get his E&s;tate; he in&s;tantly makes
Sir <HI>John</HI> re&s;olve to repay it in kind
by di&s;inheriting him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">
But at la&s;t, there ari&s;es a
misfortune from a Corner where
the <HI>Doctor</HI> lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected it.
Some of his own Party, whom
he thought inviolably attach'd to
his intere&s;ts, di&s;cover his wicked
purpo&s;es. This Sett of Men is
repre&s;ented by <HI>Charles</HI> an ingeni|ous
Gentleman, a Servant of Sir
<HI>John</HI>'s, a man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, a good
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Scholar &amp;c.
This <HI>Charles</HI> (it &s;eems) highly
obliged by the Generous treat|ment
of the <HI>Son</HI> and enamour'd
of the good Qualities of the
<HI>Daughter,</HI> both reveals, and pre|vents
the whole <HI>my&s;tery of Iniquity:</HI>
Upon which Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> &s;eeing his
project di&s;&s;appointed vents his
Rage upon this hone&s;t Gentleman;
and attempts his Life.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20">
La&s;tly, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> (to obviate
all po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;taking his
meaning) upon the winding up
of the whole de&s;ign, breaks on a
&s;udden into an open di&s;cour&s;e of
<HI>Politicks;</HI> talks of <HI>embroiling the
Nation,</HI> and <HI>ending Publick di&s;putes</HI>
and calls upon King <HI>George,</HI> with
abundance more good <HI>Morality</HI>
very well worth ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, according to your
de&s;ire, I have given a &s;hort Sketch
of the <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of this
Play; ju&s;t enough to enable &s;ome
per&s;on of greater <HI>Sagacity</HI> to find
out who are meant by every par|ticular
Per&s;onage of the <HI>Drama.</HI>
I am &s;ure I would not pre&s;ume
&s;o much as to gue&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21">
But one Thing I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
which I remember we both took
particular notice of: It is, that
the Author tho' que&s;tionle&s;s a great
ma&s;ter of Stile puts <HI>bad Engli&s;h</HI> into
the mouths of mo&s;t of his Per|&s;onages:
So that indeed &s;carce any
