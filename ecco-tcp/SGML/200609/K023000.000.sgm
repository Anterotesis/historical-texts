<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WE pre&s;ume we want no Apology to the Reader for this Publica|tion, but &s;ome may be thought needful to Mr <HI>Pope:</HI> However he cannot think our Offence &s;o great as Theirs, who fir&s;t &s;eparately publi&s;h|ed what we have here but collected in a better Form and Order. As for the Letters we have procured to be added, they &s;erve but to compleat, explain, and &s;ometimes &s;et in a true light, tho&s;e others, which it was not in the Writer's or Our power to recall.</P>
<P>This Collection hath been owing to &s;everal Cabinets; &s;ome drawn from thence by Acci|dents, and others (even of tho&s;e to Ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of that Sex we are beholden for the whole Corre&s;pondence with <HI>H. C.</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which Letters being lent her by that Gentleman, &s;he took the Liberty to print; as appears by the following, which we &s;hall give at length, both as it is &s;ome|thing curious, and as it may &s;erve for an Apology for our &s;elves.</P>

<P>AFTER &s;o long a &s;ilence, as the ma|ny and great oppre&s;&s;ions I have &s;igh'd under has occa&s;ion'd, one is at a Lo&s;s how
<PB REF="10">
to begin a letter to &s;o kind a friend as your &s;elf. But as it was always my re&s;olution, if I mu&s;t &s;ink, to do it as decently [that is as &s;ilently] as I cou'd: &s;o when I found my &s;elf plung'd into unfore&s;een, and una|voidable ruin, I retreated from the world, and in a manner buried my &s;elf in a di&s;|mal place, where I knew none, nor none knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I have protracted a lingring death, [for life it cannot be call'd] ever &s;ince you &s;aw me, &s;eque&s;ter'd from company, depriv'd of my books, and nothing left to conver&s;e with but the Letters of my dead, or ab&s;ent, friends, among&s;t which latter I always plac'd your's, and Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s, in the fir&s;t rank. I lent &s;ome of them indeed to an ingenious per|&s;on, who was &s;o delighted with the &s;peci|men, that he importuned me for a &s;ight of the re&s;t, which having obtained, he convey'd them to the Pre&s;s, I mu&s;t not &s;ay altogether with my con&s;ent, nor wholly without it. I thought them too good to be lo&s;t in oblivion, and had no cau&s;e to apprehend the di&s;obliging of any. The publick, <HI>viz.</HI> all per&s;ons of ta&s;te and judg|ment, wou'd be pleas'd with &s;o agreeable an amu&s;ement; Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI> cou'd not be angry, &s;ince it was but ju&s;tice to his merit, to publi&s;h the &s;olemn, and private profe&s;|&s;ions of Love, Gratitude, and Veneration,
<PB REF="11">
made him by &s;o celebrated an Author; and &s;urely Mr <HI>Pope</HI> ought not to re&s;ent the publication, &s;ince the early pregnancy of his Genius was no di&s;honour to his chara|cter. And yet had either of you been a&s;k'd, common mode&s;ty wou'd have oblig'd you to refu&s;e, what you wou'd not be di&s;pleas'd with, if done without your knowledge: And be&s;ides to end all di&s;pute, you had been pleas'd to make me a free gift of them, to do what I pleas'd with them: and every one knows that the per&s;on to whom a Let|ter is addre&s;s'd, has the &s;ame right to di&s;|po&s;e of it, as he has of goods purchas'd with his money. I doubt not but your ge|nero&s;ity and honour will do me the right, of owning by a line, that I came hone&s;tly by them. I flatter my &s;elf, in a few months I &s;hall again be vi&s;ible to the world, and when|ever thro' good providence that Turn &s;hall happen, I &s;hall joyfully acquaint you with it, there being none more truly your oblig'd Servant, than, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

<P>WHEN the&s;e Letters were fir&s;t print|ed, I wond'red how <HI>Curll</HI> cou'd come by 'em, and cou'd not but laugh at the pompous title; &s;ince whatever you wrote to me was humour, and familiar Raillery. As &s;oon as I came from <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> I heard you had been to &s;ee me, and I writ you a &s;hort letter from <HI>Will</HI>'s, that I long'd to &s;ee you. Mr <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s,</HI> about that time, charg'd me, with giving 'em to a Mi&s;tre&s;s, which I po&s;itively denied; not in the lea&s;t, at that time, thinking of it: but &s;ome time after, finding in the news-papers Letters from Lady <HI>Packington,</HI> Lady <HI>Chud|leigh,</HI> and Mr <HI>Norris,</HI> to the &s;ame <HI>Sapho</HI> or <HI>E. T.</HI> I began to fear that I was guilty. I have never &s;een the&s;e Letters of <HI>Curll</HI>'s, nor wou'd go to his &s;hop about them; I have not &s;een this <HI>Sapho,</HI> alias <HI>E. T.</HI> the&s;e &s;even years;&mdash;her writing, <HI>That I gave her 'em, to do what &s;he wou'd with 'em,</HI> is &s;train|ing the point too far: I thought not of it; nor do I think &s;he did then: But &s;evere Nece&s;&s;ity, which catches hold of a Twig, has produced all this; which has lain hid, and forgot by me, &s;o many years. <HI>Curll</HI> &s;ent me a Letter la&s;t week, de&s;iring a po|&s;itive an&s;wer about this matter, but find|ing

I am extremely concern'd, that my former Indi&s;cretion in putting 'em into the hands of this <HI>Pretieu&s;e,</HI> &s;hou'd have given you &s;o much di&s;turbance; for the la&s;t thing I &s;hou'd do wou'd be to di&s;oblige you; for whom I have ever pre&s;erv'd the greate&s;t e&s;teem, and &s;hall ever be, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

<P>THO' I writ my long Narrative from <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> 'till I was tir'd, yet was I not &s;atisfied; le&s;t any doubt &s;hou'd re&s;t upon your mind. I cou'd not make prote&s;tations of my Innocence of a grievous crime; but I was impatient 'till I came to Town, that I might &s;end you tho&s;e Letters, as a clear evidence, that I was a perfect &s;tranger to

all their proceeding: Shou'd I have prote&s;ted again&s;t it, after the printing, it might have been taken for an at|tempt to decry his purcha&s;e; and as the little exception you have taken, has &s;erv'd him to play his game upon us, for the&s;e two years; a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more:&mdash;The great value &s;he expre&s;&s;es for all you write, and her pa&s;&s;ion for having 'em, I believe, was what prevail'd upon me to let her keep 'em. By the interval of twelve years at lea&s;t, from her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to the time of printing 'em, 'tis manife&s;t, that I had not the lea&s;t ground to apprehend &s;uch a de&s;ign: But as People in great &s;traits, bring forth their hoards of old Gold, and mo&s;t valued Jewels, &s;o <HI>Sapho</HI> had recour&s;e to her hid trea&s;ure of Letters, and play'd off, not only your's to me, but all tho&s;e to her&s;elf (as the Lady's la&s;t-&s;take) into the pre&s;s.&mdash;As for me, I hope, when you &s;hall cooly con&s;ider the many thou&s;and in&s;tances of our being deluded by the females, &s;ince that great Original of <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>Eve,</HI> you will have a more favourable thought of the unde|&s;igning error of.</P>

<P>Now, &s;hould our Apology for this Publication be as ill receiv'd, as the Lady's &s;eems to have been by the Gentle|men concerned; we &s;hall at lea&s;t have <HI>Her Comfort</HI> of being Thank'd by the re&s;t of the world. Nor has Mr <HI>P.</HI> him&s;elf any great cau&s;e to think it much Offence to his Mode&s;ty, or Reflexion on his Judgment; when we take care to inform the Public, that there are few Let|ters of his in this Collection which were not written un|der Twenty years of Age: On the other hand, we doubt not the Reader will be much more &s;urpriz'd to find, at that early period, &s;o much variety of Style, Affecting Sen|timent, and Ju&s;tne&s;s of Critici&s;m, in pieces which mu&s;t have been writ in ha&s;te, very few perhaps ever re-view'd, and none intended for the Eye of the Public.</P>

<P>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa|vour of yours of the 8th in&s;tant; and will make you a true excu&s;e, (tho' per|haps no very good one) that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter, when I &s;ent back your Papers, in hopes of &s;eeing you at <HI>Binfield</HI> before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I &s;hould freely now (as I have done too pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly in conver&s;ation with you) tell
<PB N="2" REF="17" MS="y">
you my opinion; which I have frequently ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance with your de&s;ires, than that I could think it rea&s;onable. For I am not yet &s;atisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry, who never have been practis'd in the Art. There may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome hap|py genius's, who may judge of &s;ome of the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture: But this, tho' it may &s;ometimes be in the right, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to many mi&s;takes, and is certainly but a &s;uperficial knowledge; with|out entring into the art, the methods, and the particular excellencies of the whole compo&s;ure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides my want of skill, I have another rea&s;on why I ought to &s;u&s;pect my &s;elf, by rea&s;on of the great affection I have for you, which might give too much bia&s;s, to be kind to every thing that comes from you; but after all, I mu&s;t &s;ay (and I do it with an old-fa&s;hion'd &s;incerity.) that I en|tirely approve of your Tran&s;lation of tho&s;e Pieces of <HI>Homer,</HI> both as to the ver&s;ifica|tion and the true &s;en&s;e that &s;hines thro' the whole; nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occa&s;ion, that you
<PB N="3" REF="18">
wou'd proceed in tran&s;lating that incompa|rable Poet, to make him &s;peak good <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> to dre&s;s his admirable characters in your proper, &s;ignificant, and expre&s;&s;ive con|ceptions, and to make his works as u&s;eful and in&s;tructive to this degenerate age, as he was to our friend <HI>Horace,</HI> when he read him at <HI>Praene&s;te, Qui, quid &s;it pul|chrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c. I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which I confe&s;s I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I intreat you to &s;end this pre&s;ently to be added to the Mi&s;|cellanies, and I hope it will come time enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have nothing to &s;ay of my Nephew <HI>B</HI>'s ob&s;ervations, for he &s;ent them to me &s;o late, that I had not time to con&s;ider them; I dare &s;ay he endeavour'd very faithfully (tho' he told me very ha&s;tily) to execute your commands.</P>
<P>All I can add is, that if your exce&s;s of mo|de&s;ty &s;hou'd hinder you from publi&s;hing this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I &s;hall only be &s;orry that I have no more credit with you, to per&s;uade you to oblige the publick, and very particularly, dear Sir,</P>

<P>I Send you <HI>Dennis</HI>'s remarks on the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Critici&s;m.</NOTE><HI>E&s;|&s;ay,</HI> which equally abound in ju&s;t Cri|tici&s;ms and fine Railleries: The few ob&s;er|vations in my hand in the margins, are what a morning's lei&s;ure permitted me to make, purely for your peru&s;al. For I am of opinion, that &s;uch a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book, is but one way to be properly an|&s;wer'd, and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time per&s;ecuted by For|tune. This I knew not before; if I had, his name had been &s;par'd in the <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> for that only rea&s;on. I can't conceive what ground he has for &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a re|&s;entment; nor imagine how tho&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>But <HI>Appius</HI> reddens at each word you &s;peak,</L>
<L>And &s;tares tremendous with a threatning eye,</L>
<L>Like &s;ome fierce Tyrant in old Tape&s;try.</L></Q></NOTE>three lines can be call'd a reflection on his <HI>Per|&s;on,</HI> which only de&s;cribe him &s;ubject a little to Anger on &s;ome occa&s;ions. I have heard of combatants &s;o very furious, as to fall
<PB N="5" REF="20">
down them&s;elves with that very blow which they de&s;ign'd to lay heavy on their anta|goni&s;ts. But if Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s rage proceeds only from a zeal to di&s;courage young and unexperienc'd writers from &s;cribling, he &s;hou'd frighten us with his Ver&s;e not Pro&s;e: for I have often known, that when all the precepts in the world would not re|claim a &s;inner, &s;ome very &s;ad example has done the bu&s;ine&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Thought we find afterwards put into Ver&s;e in the <HI>Dunciad, Book</HI> 1.</NOTE> Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with rea&s;on, and I will alter 'em in ca&s;e of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindne&s;s where he meant an injury, and &s;o &s;erve in&s;tead of a friend. What he ob&s;erves at the bottom of page 20th of his reflections, was objected to by your&s;elf, and had been mended but for the ha&s;te of the pre&s;s: 'Tis right <HI>Hiber|nian,</HI> and I confe&s;s it what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call a <HI>Bull</HI> in the expre&s;&s;ion, tho' the &s;en&s;e be manife&s;t enough: Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Bulls are &s;eldom in the expre&s;&s;ion, they are always in the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly never make the lea&s;t reply to him, not only becau&s;e you advi&s;e me, but becau&s;e I have ever been of opi|nion, that if a book can't an&s;wer for it&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="21">
to the publick, 'tis to no &s;ort of purpo&s;e for its author to do it. If I am wrong in any &s;entiment of that <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> I prote&s;t &s;in|cerely, I don't de&s;ire all the world &s;hould be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill con&s;equence) meerly that I my &s;elf may be thought right, which is of very little con|&s;equence.) I'd be the fir&s;t to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my &s;elf; for (as I take it) when a man owns him&s;elf to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wi&s;er than he was. But I have had an advan|tage by the publi&s;hing that book of <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI>'s, which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould never have known: It has been the occa&s;ion of ma|king me friends, and open abetters, of &s;e|veral gentlemen of known &s;en&s;e and wit; and of proving to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken &s;ome notice of by the world in general, or I &s;hould never be attack'd thus in par|ticular. I have read that 'twas a cu&s;tom among the <HI>Romans,</HI> while a General rode in triumph, to have common &s;oldiers in the &s;treets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him; to put him in mind, that tho' his &s;ervices were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="22">
You will &s;ee by this, that whoever &s;ets up for wit in the&s;e days, ought to have the con&s;tancy of a primitive Chri&s;tian, and be prepar'd to &s;uffer martyrdom in the cau&s;e of it. But &s;ure this is the fir&s;t time that a Wit was attack'd for his <HI>Religion,</HI> as you'll find I am mo&s;t zealou&s;ly in this treati&s;e: and you know, Sir, what alarms I have had from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the en&s;uing Letters.</NOTE>oppo&s;ite &s;ide on this account.

<P>'Tis however my happine&s;s that you, Sir, are impartial,
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI> was alike to <HI>Latian</HI> and to <HI>Phrygian,</HI></L>
<L>For you well know, that Wit's of no Religion.</L></Q></P>
<P>The manner in which Mr. <HI>D.</HI> takes to pieces &s;everal particular lines, detach'd from their natural places, may &s;hew how ea&s;y it is to a caviller to give a new &s;en&s;e, or
<PB N="8" REF="23">
a new non&s;en&s;e to any thing. And in|deed his con&s;tructions are not more wre&s;t|ed from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts, as they call'd 'em.</P>
<P>Our friend the <HI>Abb&egrave;</HI> is not of that &s;ort, who with the utmo&s;t candour and free|dom, has mode&s;tly told me what others thought, and &s;hewn him&s;elf one (as he very well expre&s;&s;es it) rather of a <HI>Number</HI> than a <HI>Party.</HI> The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks mo&s;t &s;orts of learning flouri&s;h'd a|mong 'em, and I am of opinion that only &s;ome &s;ort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em: he believes, that in the mo&s;t na|tural and obvious &s;en&s;e, that line (<HI>A &s;econd deluge Learning over-run</HI>) will be under|&s;tood of Learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be under&s;tood only (as 'tis meant) of polite Learning, Critici&s;m, Poetry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is the only learning concern'd in the &s;ub|ject of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay.</HI> It is true, that the <HI>Monks</HI> did pre&s;erve what learning there was, about <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth's time; but tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded fell into the depth of Barba|ri&s;m, or at lea&s;t &s;tood at a &s;tay while others ro&s;e from thence, in&s;omuch that even <HI>Era&s;|mus</HI> and <HI>Reuchlin</HI> could hardly laugh them out of it.

in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his te&s;tifying &s;ome e&s;teem for the book, ju&s;t at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour again&s;t it, is an in&s;tance of great genero&s;ity and candor, which I &s;hall ever acknowledge.</P>

<P>THE concern which you more than &s;eem to be affected with for my reputation, by the &s;everal accounts you have &s;o obligingly given of what reports and cen&s;ures the holy <HI>Vandals</HI> have thought fit to pa&s;s upon me, makes me de&s;irous of telling &s;o good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of letting before you in a clear light the true &s;tate of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believ'd the be&s;t piece of &s;ervice one cou'd do to our religion, was openly to expre&s;s our dete&s;tation and &s;corn of all tho&s;e mean artifices and <HI>Piae fraudes,</HI> which it &s;tands &s;o little in need of, and which have laid it under &s;o great a &s;can|dal among its enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="28">
Nothing has been &s;o much a &s;carecrow to them, as that too peremptory and &s;eem|ingly-uncharitable a&s;&s;ertion of an utter <HI>Im|po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of <HI>Salvation</HI> to all but our&s;elves; <HI>invincible</HI> ignorance excepted, which in|deed &s;ome people define under &s;o great li|mitations, and with &s;uch exclu&s;ions, that it &s;eems as if that word were rather in|vented as a &s;alvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl'd about &s;o freely on almo&s;t all mankind by the Hands of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks) than as a real exception to almo&s;t-univer&s;al damnation. For, be&s;ides the &s;mall number of the truly faithful in our Church, we mu&s;t again &s;ubdivide; the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t</HI> is damned by the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> by the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Scoti&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Thomi&s;t,</HI> and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>There may be errors I grant, but I can't think 'em of &s;uch con&s;equence as to de&s;troy utterly the charity of mankind; the very greate&s;t bond in which we are engag'd by God to one another. Therefore I own to you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex|pre&s;s my di&s;like of &s;o &s;hocking a &s;entiment as tho&s;e of the religion I profe&s;s are com|monly charg'd with; and I hop'd, a &s;light in&s;inuation, introduc'd &s;o ea&s;ily by a ca|&s;ual &s;imilitude only, cou'd never have gi|ven offence; but on the contrary mu&s;t

<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I took occa&s;ion to mention the <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> of &s;ome ages after the &s;ubver&s;ion of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> which is too manife&s;t a truth to be deny'd, and does in no &s;ort reflect upon the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ors of our faith who are free from it. Our &s;ilence in the&s;e points may with &s;ome rea&s;on make our adver&s;aries think we allow and per&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e bigottries; which yet in reality all good and &s;en&s;ible Men de&s;pi&s;e, tho' they are per&s;uaded not to &s;peak again&s;t 'em; I can't tell why, &s;ince now 'tis no way the intere&s;t even of the wor&s;t of our Prie&s;thood (as it might have been then) to have them &s;mother'd in &s;i|lence: For as the oppo&s;ite Sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being &s;lander'd; 'tis our bu&s;ine&s;s now to &s;how it is &s;lander'd unju&s;tly, and to vindicate our&s;elves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't &s;o well be brought about with &s;erious faces; we mu&s;t laugh with them at what de&s;erves it; and then we need not doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi|nions.</P>

As to particulars: you cannot but have ob&s;erv'd that at fir&s;t the whole objection again&s;t the &s;imile of wit and faith lay to the word <HI>They:</HI> When that was beyond contradiction removed (the very Grammar &s;erving to confute 'em) then the objection lies again&s;t the <HI>Simile it&s;elf;</HI> or if that &s;i|mile will not be objected to (&s;en&s;e and common rea&s;on being indeed a little &s;tub|born, and not apt to give way to every body) next the mention of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> mu&s;t become a crime (as if <HI>Religion</HI> and &s;he were &s;i&s;ters, or that it were a &s;candal upon the family of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to &s;ay a word again&s;t the Devil's ba&s;tard.) Afterwards, more mi&s;chief is di&s;cover'd in a place that &s;eem'd innocent at fir&s;t, the two lines about <HI>Schi&s;|matics,</HI> at the bottom of page 24. An or|dinary man wou'd imagine the author plainly declar'd again&s;t tho&s;e &s;chi&s;matics, for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the under&s;tanding of &s;ome few of its believers: But the&s;e believers are call'd <HI>Dull,</HI> and becau&s;e I &s;ay that <HI>tho&s;e Schi&s;|matics</HI> think <HI>&s;ome</HI> believers <HI>dull,</HI> therefore the&s;e charitable interpreters of my mean|ing will have it, that <HI>I</HI> think <HI>all</HI> believers dull.

Others, you know, were as angry that I mention'd Mr. <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> with honour; who as he never refu&s;ed to any one of merit of any party the prai&s;e due to him, &s;o hone&s;tly de&s;erv'd it from all others, tho' of ever &s;o diffe|rent intere&s;ts or &s;entiments.

<P>YOU formerly ob&s;erv'd to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the di&s;parity we often find in him &s;ick and well: Thus one of an unfortunate con&s;titution is perpetually exhibiting a mi&s;erable example of the weak|ne&s;s of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to con&s;ider my&s;elf in the&s;e diffe|rent views, and I hope have receiv'd &s;ome

advantage by it, if what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> &s;ays be true, that

<P>Then &s;urely &s;ickne&s;s, contributing no le&s;s than old age to the &s;haking down this &s;caffolding of the body, may di&s;cover the inward &s;tructure more plainly. Sickne&s;s is a &s;ort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly &s;tate, and in&s;pires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thou&s;and volumes of philo&s;ophers and divines. It gives &s;o warning a con|cu&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e props of our vanity, our &s;trength and youth, that we think of for|tifying our&s;elves within, when there is &s;o little dependance upon our out-works. Youth at the very be&s;t is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and &s;moother manner than age: 'Tis like a &s;tream that nouri&s;hes a plant upon a bank, and cau&s;es it to flouri&s;h and blo&s;&s;om to the &s;ight, but at the &s;ame time is undermining it at the root in &s;ecret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me, it has afforded &s;everal Pro&s;pects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the
<PB N="29" REF="44">
world have nor dazzled me very much; and I begin where mo&s;t people end, with a full conviction of the emptine&s;s of all &s;orts of ambition, and the un&s;atisfactory nature of all human plea&s;ures. When a &s;mart fit of &s;ickne&s;s tells me this &s;curvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that hone&s;t <HI>Hibernian,</HI> who being in bed in the great &s;torm &s;ome years ago, and told the hou&s;e would tumble over his head, made an&s;wer, What care I for the hou&s;e? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the be&s;t time to die when one is in the be&s;t hu|mour, and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively weak as I now am I may &s;ay with con&s;cience, that I am not at all unea&s;y at the thought that ma|ny men whom I never had any e&s;teem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an incon&s;iderable little atome every &s;ingle man is, with re&s;pect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a &s;hame to be concern'd at the removal of &s;uch a trivial animal as I am. The morning af|ter my Exit, the &s;un will ri&s;e as bright as ever, the flowers &s;mell as &s;weet, the plants &s;pring as green, the world will proceed in its old cour&s;e, people will laugh as hear|tily, and marry as fa&s;t as they were us'd to do.

many things that would give me &s;hame, if I were not more de&s;irous to be thought hone&s;t than prudent: &s;o many things freely thrown out, &s;uch lengths of unre&s;erv'd friend&s;hip, thoughts ju&s;t warm from the brain, without any poli&s;hing or dre&s;s, the very di&s;habille of the under&s;tanding. You have prov'd your&s;elf more tender of an|other's embryo's than the fonde&s;t mothers are of their own, for you have pre&s;erv'd every thing that I mi&s;carry'd of.

<P>They will not be of any great &s;ervice (I find) in the de&s;ign I mentioned to you: I believe I had better &s;teal from a richer man, and plunder your letters, (which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents, &s;ince they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour.)

This proceeding, join'd to that natural va|nity which fir&s;t makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a cox|comb for life.

I would not be thought to &s;ay this, as if the obliging letter you &s;ent me de&s;erv'd this imputation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aid of his Wife. <HI>It was not &s;ufficient that he knew her to be cha&s;t, him&s;elf, but &s;he &s;hou'd not be &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected by others.</HI></P>

<P>The numerous and violent claps of the Whig-party on the one &s;ide of the theatre, were echo'd back by the Tories on the other; while the Author &s;weated behind the &s;cenes with concern, to find their applau&s;e proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the ca&s;e too of the Prologue-writer, who was clapp'd into a &s;tanch Whig, at almo&s;t ev'ry two lines.

<P>I Have receiv'd your letter, and am glad to find that you have laid &s;o good a &s;cheme for your great undertaking. I que&s;tion not but the Pro&s;e will require as much care as the Poetry, but the variety will give your &s;elf &s;ome relief, and more plea&s;ure to your readers.</P>

<P>YOUR la&s;t is the more obliging, as it hints at &s;ome little niceties in my con|duct, which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me, and which (&s;o trivial as things of this nature &s;eem) are yet of no &s;light con&s;equence, to people whom every body talks of, and every body as he plea&s;es. 'Tis a &s;ort of Tax that attends an e&s;tate in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion an author holds. For indeed an author who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thanked for the plea|&s;ure, and &s;ometimes ill-treated by tho&s;e very per&s;ons that fir&s;t debauch'd him. Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way di&s;pleas'd that I have offended the violent of all Parties already; and at the &s;ame time I a&s;&s;ure you con&s;cientiou&s;ly, I feel not the lea&s;t malevolence or re&s;entment again&s;t any of tho&s;e who mi&s;repre&s;ent me, or are di&s;&s;atisfied with me. This frame of mind is &s;o ea&s;y, that I am perfectly content with my condition.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="66">
As I hope and would flatter my&s;elf, that you know me and my thoughts &s;o entirely as never to be mi&s;taken in either, &s;o 'tis a plea&s;ure to me that you gue&s;s'd &s;o right in regard to the Author of that <HI>Guardian</HI> you mentioned. But I am &s;orry to find it has taken air that I have &s;ome hand in tho&s;e Papers, becau&s;e I write &s;o very few as neither to de&s;erve the credit of &s;uch a report with &s;ome people, nor the di&s;repute of it with others. An hone&s;t <HI>Jacobite</HI> &s;poke to me the &s;en&s;e or non|&s;en&s;e of the weak part of his Party ve|ry fairly, that the good people took it ill of me, that I writ with <HI>Steele,</HI> tho' upon never &s;o indifferent &s;ubjects&mdash;This I know you will laugh at as well as I do: yet I doubt not but many little ca|lumniators and per&s;ons of &s;ower di&s;po&s;i|tions will take occa&s;ion hence to be&s;patter me. I confe&s;s I &s;corn narrow &s;ouls, of all parties, and if I renounce my rea&s;on in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pa&s;s that the few <HI>Guardians</HI> I have written are &s;o generally known for mine: that in par|ticular which you mention I never di&s;co|vered to any man but the publi&s;her, till ve|ry lately: yet almo&s;t every body I met told me of it.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="67">
The true rea&s;on that Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> laid down the Paper, was a quarrel between him and <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on.</HI> He &s;tood engaged to his book&s;eller, in articles of penalty, for all the <HI>Guardians;</HI> and by de&s;i&s;ting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> was quit of his obliga|tion: the&s;e papers being printed by <HI>Buck|ley.</HI></P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I cannot any way enter into that &s;ecret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the re&s;t of his politicks. Tho' 'tis &s;aid, he will take into the&s;e papers al&s;o &s;everal &s;ub|jects of the politick kind, as before: But I a&s;&s;ure you as to my&s;elf, I have quite done with 'em, for the future. The little I have done, and the great re&s;pect I bear Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> as a Man of Wit, has rendered me a &s;u&s;pected Whig to &s;ome of the Violent, but (as old <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;aid before me) 'Tis not the Violent I de&s;ign to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I generally employ the mornings in paint|ing with Mr. <HI>Jervas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to him in Ver&s;e, writ about this time.</NOTE>; and the evenings in the conver&s;ation of &s;uch, as I think can mo&s;t improve my mind, of whatever Party or Denomination they are.

'Tis partly from this maxim that I depend upon your friend&s;hip, becau&s;e I believe it will do ju|&s;tice to my intention in every thing; and give me leave to tell you, that (as the world goes) this is no &s;mall a&s;&s;urance I repo&s;e in you.

<P>Good God! What an incongruous ani|mal is Man? how un&s;ettled is his be&s;t part, his Soul; and how changing and variable in his frame of Body? The con&s;tancy of the one &s;hook by every Notion, the tempe|rament of the other affected by every bla&s;t of wind! What is man altogether, but one mighty Incon&s;i&s;tency! Sickne&s;s and Pain is the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear the portion of the other! What a bu&s;tle we make about pa&s;&s;ing our time, when all our &s;pace is but a point? What aims and am|bitions are crowded into this little in&s;tant of our life, which (as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> finely words it) is <HI>Rounded with a Sleep?</HI> Our whole extent of Being no more, in the eyes of him who gave it, than a &s;carce perceptible moment of duration. Tho&s;e animals who&s;e circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the Naturali&s;ts a&s;&s;ure us, are yet as long-lived and po&s;&s;e&s;s as wide a &s;cene of action as man, if we con&s;ider him with an eye to all Space, and all Eternity. Who knows what plots, what atchievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of du&s;t, within his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of &s;ome minutes? and of how much le&s;s

con&s;ideration than even this, is the life of man in the &s;ight of that God, who is from Ever, and for Ever!</P>
<P>Who that thinks in this train, but mu&s;t &s;ee the world and its contemptible gran|deurs le&s;&s;en before him at every thought? 'Tis enough to make one remain &s;tupify'd, in a poize of inaction, void of all de&s;ires, of all de&s;igns, of all friend&s;hips.</P>

and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com|fortable pro&s;pect to be reflecting, that &s;o long a &s;iege as that of <HI>Troy</HI> lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progre&s;s. Indeed the <HI>Greek</HI> fortification upon a nearer ap|proach does not appear &s;o formidable as it did, and I am almo&s;t apt to flotter my&s;elf, that <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ecretly &s;eems inclined to a cor|re&s;pondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are indeed, a &s;ort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, called Commentators and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo|ple by their number and bulk, and perplex our progre&s;s under pretence of fortifying their author. The&s;e lie very low in the trenches and ditches they them&s;elves have digged, encompa&s;&s;ed with dirt of their own heaping up, but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more &s;peedy and gallant way than by mining under ground, that is, by u&s;ing the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly|ing over their heads.</P>
<P>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find you are concern'd how I &s;hall be paid, and are &s;ollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many di&s;carded Generals, to be fir&s;t envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and la&s;tly neglected. The former (the
<PB N="58" REF="73">
con&s;tant attendant upon all great and lau|dable enterprizes) I have already experi|enc'd. Some have &s;aid I am not a Ma&s;ter in the <HI>Greek,</HI> who either are &s;o them&s;elves or are not: If they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without having catechized me. But if they can read (for I know &s;ome Critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying be|fore them, &s;ome &s;pecimens of my tran|&s;lation from this Author in the <HI>Mi&s;cel|lanies,</HI> which they are heartily welcome to. I have met with as much malignity another way, &s;ome calling me a Tory, becau&s;e the heads of that party have been di&s;tingui&s;hingly favourable to me; &s;ome a Whig, becau&s;e I have been favoured with yours, Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Craggs</HI> his friend&s;hip, and of late with my Lord <HI>Hal|lifax</HI>'s Patronage. How much more natu|ral a conclu&s;ion might be formed, by any good-natur'd man, that a per&s;on who has been well u&s;ed by all &s;ides, has been offen|&s;ive to none. This mi&s;erable age is &s;o &s;unk between animo&s;ities of Party and tho&s;e of Religion, that I begin to fear, mo&s;t men have politicks enough to make (thro' vio|lence) the be&s;t Scheme of Government a bad one; and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation.

<P>THE Que&s;tion you ask in relation to Mr. <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> and <HI>Philips,</HI> I &s;hall an|&s;wer in a few words. Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> did ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf with much indignation again&s;t me one evening at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e (as I was told) &s;aying, That I was entered into a Cabal with Dean <HI>Swift</HI> and others to write again&s;t the <HI>Whig-Intere&s;t,</HI> and in par|ticular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> never open'd his lips to my face, on this or any like occa&s;ion, tho' I was almo&s;t every night in the &s;ame room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> came to me a night or two af|ter <HI>Philips</HI> had talk'd in this idle manner, and a&s;&s;ur'd me of his disbelief of what had been &s;aid, of the friend&s;hip we &s;hou'd always maintain, and de&s;ir'd I wou'd &s;ay nothing further of it. My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> did me the honour to &s;tir in this matter, by &s;peaking to &s;everal people to obviate a fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ion, which might have done me no &s;mall preju|dice with one Party. However <HI>Philips</HI> did all
<PB N="63" REF="78">
he could, &s;ecretly to continue the report with the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club, and kept in his hands the Sub&s;criptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have &s;ince given him to under&s;tand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with a man whom I think a &s;coundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for this money, but commi&s;&s;ioned one of the <HI>Players,</HI> his equals, to receive it. This is the whole matter; but as to the &s;ecret grounds of <HI>Philips</HI>'s malignity, they will make a very plea&s;ant Hi&s;tory when we meet. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> and &s;ome others have been much diverted with it, and mo&s;t of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club have made it the &s;ubject of their ridicule on their Secretary. It is to this management of <HI>Philips,</HI> that the world owes Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Pa&s;torals.</HI> The ingenious Author is extream|ly your &s;ervant, and would have comply'd with your kind invitation, but that he is ju&s;t now appointed Secretary to my Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> in his Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>

<P>YOU mention the account I gave you &s;ome time ago of the things which <HI>Philips</HI> &s;aid in his fooli&s;hne&s;s; but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter, whe|ther you receiv'd a long one from me a|bout a fortnight &s;ince. It was principally intended to thank you for the la&s;t obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that rea&s;on you pa&s;s it in &s;ilence. I there launched into &s;ome account of my tem|poral affairs, and intend now to give you &s;ome hints of my &s;piritual. The conclu|&s;ion of your Letter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you <HI>pray'd</HI> for me: Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of mo&s;t other Friends, who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done
<PB N="65" REF="80">
him a &s;ervice, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences, which I a&s;&s;ure you I am daily more and more convine'd of; and indeed I have for &s;ome years pa&s;t, look'd upon all of 'em no better than amu&s;ements. To make them the ultimate end of our pur&s;uit, is a mi&s;erable and &s;hort ambition, which will drop from us at ev'ry little di&s;|appointments here, and even in ca&s;e of no di&s;appointmentr here, will infallibly de&s;ert us hereafter. The utmo&s;t fame they are capable of be&s;towing, is never worth the pains they co&s;t us, and the time they lo&s;e us. If you attain the top of your de&s;ires that way, all tho&s;e who envy you will do you harm; and of tho&s;e who admire you, few will do you good. The un&s;ucce&s;sful writers are your declared enemies, and pro|bably the &s;ucce&s;sful your &s;ecret ones: For tho&s;e hate not more to be excelled, than the&s;e to be rivalled. And at the up&s;hot, after a life of perpetual application, to re|flect that you have been doing nothing for your&s;elf, and that the &s;ame or le&s;s In|du&s;try might have gain'd you a Friend&s;hip that can never deceive or end, a &s;atisfaction which prai&s;e cannot be&s;tow, nor vanity feel, and a glory which (tho' in one re&s;pect like &s;ame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<PB N="66" REF="81">
&s;hall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. The&s;e, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my &s;entiments, whenever I think at all; for half the things that employ our heads de&s;erve not the name of thoughts they are only &s;tronger dreams or impre&s;&s;ions upon the imagination: Our &s;chemes of government, our &s;y&s;tems of phi|lo&s;ophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but &s;o many &s;hadowy images, and airy pro&s;|pects, which ari&s;e to us but &s;o much the livelier and more frequent, as we are more o'erca&s;t with the darkne&s;s, and di&s;turb'd with the fumes of human vanity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing that makes old men wil|ling to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long habit, and wearine&s;s of the &s;ame track. <HI>Homer</HI> will work a cure upon me; fifteen thou&s;and ver&s;es are equivalent to four&s;core years, to make one old in Rhime: And I &s;hou'd be &s;orry and a&s;hamed, to go on jingling to the la&s;t &s;tep, like a waggoner's hor&s;e, in the &s;ame road, and &s;o leave my <HI>Bells</HI> to the next &s;illy ani|mal that will be proud of 'em. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of rea&s;on, who is mea&s;uring &s;yllables and coupling rhimes, when he &s;hould be mending his own Soul, and &s;ecuring his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I &s;hould be unwor|thy even of tho&s;e &s;mall and limited parts

<P>I Have no better excu&s;e to offer you, that I have omitted a task naturally &s;o plea|&s;ing to me as conver&s;ing upon paper with you; but that my time and eyes have been wholly employ'd upon <HI>Homer,</HI> whom I al|mo&s;t fear I &s;hall find but one way of imita|ting, which is, in his blindne&s;s. I am per|petually afflicted with headach's, that very much affect my &s;ight; and indeed &s;ince my coming hither I have &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed an hour agreeably, except that in which I read your letter. I would &s;eriou&s;ly have you think, you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friend&s;hip, than he who lea&s;t de&s;erves it on all other ac|counts than his due &s;en&s;e of it. But let me tell you, you can hardly gue&s;s what a task you undertake, when you profe&s;s your &s;elf my friend; there are &s;ome <HI>Tories</HI> who will take you for a <HI>Whig,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Whigs</HI>

<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be ju&s;t to all men. The notions of right and wrong are &s;o far &s;train'd, that perhaps to be in the right &s;o very violently, may be of wor&s;e con&s;equence than to be ea&s;ily and quietly in the wrong. I really wi&s;h all men &s;o well, that I am &s;atisfied but few can wi&s;h me &s;o; but if tho&s;e few are &s;uch as tell me they do, I am content, for they are the be&s;t people I know: While you believe me what I profe&s;s as to Religion, I can bear any thing the Bigotted may &s;ay; while Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> likes my poetry, I can endure <HI>Dennis</HI> and a thou&s;and more like him; while the mo&s;t hone&s;t and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can ea&s;ily &s;upport it, tho' the mo&s;t violent and mad of all parties ro&s;e up to throw dirt at me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my <HI>Homer.</HI> Whoever in our times would be a profe&s;&s;or of learning above his fellows, ought at the very fir&s;t to enter the world with the con&s;tancy and re|&s;olution of a primitive Chri&s;tian, and be prepared to &s;uffer all &s;orts of publick Per&s;e|cution.
<PB N="69" REF="84">
It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but endeavour to di&s;tin|gui&s;h him&s;elf, or gratify others by his &s;tudies, he is immediately treated as a common ene|my, in&s;tead of being look'd upon as a com|mon friend; and a&s;&s;aulted as generally, as if his whole de&s;ign were to prejudice the State, and ruin the publick. I will venture to &s;ay, no man ever ro&s;e to any degree of perfe|ction in writing, but thro' ob&s;tinacy and an inveterate re&s;olution again&s;t the &s;tream of mankind: So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned, it was in its own de&s;pite. For when fir&s;t they e&s;&s;ay their parts, all people in general are prejudiced again&s;t new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then &s;ome particular per&s;ons who were be|fore unfortunate in their own attempts, are &s;worn foes to them, only becau&s;e they &s;uc|ceed.&mdash;Upon the whole, one may &s;ay of the be&s;t writers, that they pay a &s;evere fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s part of mankind to levy upon them when they plea&s;e.</P>

<P>So you &s;ee me cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments, or common di&s;cour&s;e. The fir&s;t you wou'd take ill, tho' I told you but half what I ought; &s;o in &s;hort the la&s;t only remains.</P>

I fancy no friend&s;hip is &s;o likely to prove la&s;ting as ours, becau&s;e I am pretty &s;ure there never was a friend&s;hip of &s;o ea&s;y a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Va|nity we have, expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Arti&s;t you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope (piou&s;ly hope) to hear the&s;e things. At home we follow our bu&s;ine&s;s, when we have any; and think and talk mo&s;t of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friend&s;hip of a &s;tay'd man and his wife, who are &s;eldom &s;o fond as to hin|der the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e from going on all day, or &s;o indolent as not to find con&s;olation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the la&s;t, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantick friend|&s;hips, like violent loves, begin with di&s;|quiets, proceed to jealou&s;ies, and conclude in animo&s;ities. I have liv'd to &s;ee the fierce advancement, the &s;udden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of the&s;e enormous friend&s;hips, and am perfectly con|vinced of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in, That nothing hinders the con|&s;tant agreement of people who live toge|ther,

but meer vanity; a &s;ecret in&s;i&s;ting upon what they think their dignity or merit, and an inward expectation of &s;uch an Over-mea&s;ure of deference and regard, as an&s;wers to their own extravagant fal&s;e &s;cale; and which no body can pay, becau&s;e none but them&s;elves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts.</P>

<P>What you mention'd of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and me, de&s;erves acknowledg|ments on my part.

<P>I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to &s;peak of me in a manner which nothing but the real re&s;pect I have for you can de&s;erve. May I hope that &s;ome late male|volencies have lo&s;t their effect?

<P>I will not value my&s;elf upon having ever guarded all the degrees of re&s;pect for you; for (to &s;ay the truth) all the world &s;peaks well of you, and I &s;hould be under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing the &s;ame, whether I cared for you or not.</P>
<P>As to what you have &s;aid of me, I &s;hall never believe that the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> can &s;peak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you &s;incere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two fir&s;t books of my tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI> which are now in the hands of my Lord <HI>Halifax.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore &s;ome evidence of the tru&s;t I repo&s;e in your good will, when I give you this opportunity of &s;peaking ill of me with ju&s;tice, and yet expect you will tell me your true&s;t thoughts, at the &s;ame time that you tell others your mo&s;t favourable ones.</P>
<P>I have a farther reque&s;t, which I mu&s;t pre&s;s with earne&s;tne&s;s.

<P>Since we are upon proofs of &s;incerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each other's opinion) give me leave to name another pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I wi&s;h you would alter It is where you mention an ob&s;ervation upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s Ver&s;es of <HI>Sy&s;i|phus</HI>'s Stone, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Words are &s;ince le&s;t out in Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s Edition, but were extant in all during Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Life.</NOTE><HI>never having been made before by any of the Criticks:</HI> I happen'd to find the &s;ame in <HI>Dyoni&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI>'s Treati&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, who treats very largely upon the&s;e Ver&s;es.

<P>THE Farce of the <HI>What-d'ye-call it,</HI> has occa&s;ioned many different &s;peculations in the town.

Several templers, and others of the more vociferous kind of criticks, went with a re&s;olution to hi&s;s, and confe&s;t they were forced to laugh &s;o much, that they forgot the de&s;ign they came with. The Court in general has in a

very particular manner come into the je&s;t, and the three fir&s;t Nights, (notwith&s;tanding two of them were court-nights) were di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by very full audiences of the fir&s;t quality. The common people of the pit and gallery receiv'd it at fir&s;t with great gravity and &s;edatene&s;s, &s;ome few with tears; but after the third day they al&s;o took the hint, and have ever &s;ince been very loud in their claps.

<P>Ye&s;terday Mr. <HI>Steele</HI>'s affair was decided: I am &s;orry I can be of no other opinion than yours, as to his whole carriage and writings of late.

<P>I long to &s;ee you a Hi&s;tory Painter. You have already done enough for the Private, do &s;omething for the Publick; and be not confined, like the re&s;t, to draw only &s;uch &s;illy &s;tories as our own faces tell of us.

<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trou|ble you with a Letter, but was di&s;cou|raged for want of &s;omething that I could think worth &s;ending fifteen hundred Miles. <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;uch an exhau&s;ted Subject, that, I dare &s;ay, you'd ea&s;ily forgive my &s;aying nothing of it; and the imagination of a Poet is a thing &s;o nice and delicate, that it is no ea&s;y matter to find out Images capable of giving Plea&s;ure to one of the few, who (in any Age) have come up to that Character. I am ne|verthele&s;s lately returned from an I&s;land, where I pa&s;&s;ed three or four Months, which, were it &s;et out in its true Colours, might methinks amu&s;e you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The I&s;land <HI>Inarime</HI> is an Epitome of the whole Earth, containing within the compa&s;s of eighteen Miles, a won|derful variety of Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains, and barren Mountains, all thrown together in a mo&s;t romantic Confu|&s;ion.
<PB N="122" REF="138">
The Air is in the hotte&s;t Sea&s;on con|&s;tantly refre&s;hed by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales produce excellent Wheat and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, but are mo&s;tly covered with Vineyards, intermixt with Fruit-trees. Be&s;ides the common kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Peaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they produce Oran|ges, Limes, Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Melons, and many other Fruits un|known to our Climates, which lie every where open to the Pa&s;&s;enger. The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines, &s;ome with Che&s;nut Groves, and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lenti&s;cus. The Fields on the Northern &s;ide are divided by hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Foun|tains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land&s;cape, which is likewi&s;e &s;et off by the variety of &s;ome barren Spots, and naked Rocks. But that which crowns the Scene, is a large Mountain, ri&s;ing out of the middle of the I&s;land (once a terrible <HI>Volcano,</HI> by the Ancients called <HI>Mons Epomeus</HI>) its lower parts are adorned with Vines and other Fruits, the middle affords Pa&s;ture to flocks of Goats and Sheep, and the top is a &s;andy pointed Rock, from which you have the fine&s;t Pro&s;pect in the World, &s;urveying at one view, be&s;ides &s;everal plea&s;ant I&s;lands lying at your Feet, a tract of <HI>Italy</HI> about three hundred Miles in length, from the Promontory of <HI>Antium,</HI> to
<PB N="126" REF="139">
he Cape of <HI>Palinurus.</HI> The greater part of which hath been &s;ung by <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> as making a con&s;iderable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes. The I&s;lands <HI>Caprea, Prochyta,</HI> and <HI>Parthe|nope,</HI> together with <HI>Cajeta, Cumae, Monte, Mi&s;eno,</HI> the Habitations of <HI>Circe,</HI> the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and the <HI>Le&s;trigones,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Promontory of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and the whole <HI>Campagnia felice,</HI> make but a part of this noble Land&s;cape; which would demand an Imagination as warm, and numbers as flow|ing as your own, to de&s;cribe it. The Inha|bitants of this delicious I&s;le, as they are without Riches and Honours, &s;o are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them; and were they but as much &s;trangers to Revenge, as they are to Avarice or Am|bition, they might in fact an&s;wer the poeti|cal Notions of the Golden Age. But they have got, as an alloy to their Happine&s;s, an ill habit of murdering one another on flight Offences. We had an In&s;tance of this the &s;econd Night after our Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being &s;hot dead by our Door: And yet by the &s;ole &s;ecret of minding our own bu&s;ine&s;s, we found a means of living &s;ecurely among the&s;e dangerous People. Would you know how we pa&s;s the time at <HI>Naples?</HI> Our chief Entertainment is the Devotion of our Neighbours. Be&s;ides the
<PB N="124" REF="140">
gayety of their Churches (where Folks go to &s;ee what they call <HI>una Bella Devotione</HI> (i. e.) a &s;ort of Religious Opera) they make Fire|works almo&s;t every Week out of Devotion; the Streets are often hung with Arras out of Devotion; and (what is &s;till more &s;trange) the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Hou&s;es, and treat them with Mu&s;ick and Sweetmeats, out of Devotion; in a word, were it not for this Devotion of its inhabitants, <HI>Naples</HI> would have little el&s;e to recommend it, be|&s;ide the Air and Situation. Learning is in no very thriving &s;tate here, as indeed no where el&s;e in <HI>Italy.</HI> However, among many pretenders, &s;ome Men of ta&s;te are to be met with.

I wi&s;h you Health to go on with that noble Work, and when you have that, I need not wi&s;h you Succe&s;s.

<P>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to &s;ee and conver&s;e with a Man, whom in his Writings I had &s;o long known with Plea&s;ure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very fir&s;t meeting, doing ju&s;tice to your dead friend Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I was not &s;o happy as to know him; <HI>Virgilium tantum vidi</HI>&mdash;Had I been born early enough, I mu&s;t have known and lov'd him: For I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, not only by your &s;elf, but by Mr.
<PB N="2" REF="147">
<HI>Congreve</HI> and Sir <HI>William Trumbul,</HI> that his per&s;onal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwith&s;tanding the many libel|lous Mi&s;repre&s;entations of them, (again&s;t which the former of the&s;e Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;ince did &s;o, in his Dedication to the Duke of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> prefix'd to <HI>Ton&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Duodecimo</HI> Edition of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, 1717.</NOTE>.) I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his &s;ucce&s;s and fame: And tho&s;e Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's Evening, which are never very trouble&s;ome but in the fine&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Sea&s;on; (for his Fire, like the Sun's, &s;hin'd cleare&s;t towards its &s;et|ting.)</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own Perfor|mances that they were above tho&s;e Cri|ticks, I was &s;o vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be &s;o humble as to think my &s;elf quite below their Notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na|tural Inclination to Carrion: And though &s;uch poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is &s;o poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is &s;o beggarly but he can keep a Critic. So I'm &s;ar from

Our Wit (as you call it)is but Reflection or Imitation, there|fore &s;carce to be call'd ours. True Wit, I believe, may be defin'd Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought, and a Facility of Expre&s;&s;ion; or (in the Midwives Phra&s;e) a perfect Conception, with an ea&s;y Delivery. However this is far from a compleat Definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</P>

How|ever, I hope, you who have as much Good-Nature as Good Sen&s;e, (&s;ince they gene|rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In|clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time &s;hould con&s;ider when you have oblig'd me beyond my pre&s;ent Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an hone&s;t Man, if he but intends to be ju&s;t when he is able, tho' late. But I &s;hould be le&s;s ju&s;t to you, the more I thought I could make a Re|turn to &s;o much Profu&s;ene&s;s of Wit and Humanity together; which though they &s;el|dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you &s;o equally met, I know not in which you mo&s;t abound.

<P>WHEN I write to you, I fore&s;ee a long Letter, and ought to beg your

Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longe&s;t, it will be of cour&s;e the wor&s;t I have troubled you with. Yet to expre&s;s my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Intere&s;t; as &s;ome People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindne&s;s, to put you in mind of be&s;towing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more di&s;tinctly I &s;ee my Faults; Spots and Blemi&s;hes, you know, are never &s;o plainly di&s;cover'd as in the brighte&s;t Sun|&s;hine. Thus I am mortified by tho&s;e Com|mendations which were de&s;ign'd to encou|rage me: for Prai&s;e to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode|rately be&s;tow'd, it chears and revives; but if too lavi&s;hly, overcharges and depre&s;&s;es him.

In a word, I mu&s;t blame you for treating me with &s;o much Compliment, which is at be&s;t but the Smoak of Friend&s;hip.

<P>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <HI>March</HI> I have received, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Ju&s;tice, for giving you your Due; who &s;hou'd not let your Mode&s;ty be &s;o unju&s;t to your Merit, as to reject
<PB N="8" REF="153">
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is &s;o &s;hort of your de&s;ert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend|&s;hip, (as you &s;ay) however you mu&s;t allow there is no Smoak but there is &s;ome Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incen&s;e offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half &s;o &s;weet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; &s;o Friend&s;hip, like Love, cannot be without &s;ome Incen&s;e, to perfume the Name it would prai&s;e and immortalize. But &s;ince you &s;ay you do not write to me to gain my <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> but my <HI>Affection,</HI> pray how is it po&s;&s;ible to have the one without the other? We mu&s;t admire be&s;ore we love. You affirm, you would have me &s;o much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be &s;o hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be per&s;uaded to it. Be|&s;ides, the Vanity of a Scribler is &s;uch, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; e&s;pecially when he mu&s;t take pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your &s;elf, I cannot &s;uffer you to murther your Fame, with your own hand, without oppo&s;ing you; e&s;pecially when you &s;ay your la&s;t Let|ter

<P>I Cannot contend with you. You mu&s;t give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your De&s;ign is to encourage me. But I &s;eparate from all the re&s;t that Paragraph or two, in which you make me &s;o warm an Offer of your Friend|&s;hip. Were I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of That, it would put an end to all tho&s;e Speeches with which you now make me blu&s;h; and change them to whole&s;ome Advices, and free Sen|timents, which might make me wi&s;er and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friend&s;hip is be&s;t contracted betwixt Per&s;ons of equal Age: but I have &s;o much Intere&s;t to be of another Mind, that you mu&s;t pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in oppo&s;ition to that Opinion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally cau&s;ed by our finding the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;itions in them, which we feel in our &s;elves. This is but Self-love at the bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be &s;uch, the Inclinations of &s;uch
<PB N="12" REF="157">
being commonly various. The Friend&s;hip of two young Men is often occa&s;ioned by Love of Plea&s;ure or Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, each being de&s;irous, for his own &s;ake, of one to a&s;&s;i&s;t or incourage him in the Cour&s;es he pur&s;ues; as that of two old Men is fre|quently on the &s;core of &s;ome Profit, Lucre, or De&s;ign upon others. Now, as a young Man who is le&s;s acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability le&s;s of Intere&s;t; and an old Man who may be weary of him&s;elf, le&s;s of Self-love; &s;o the Friend&s;hip between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self|regard. One may add to this, that &s;uch a Friend&s;hip is of greater U&s;e and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to plea&s;e the young one; and the young Man more di&s;creet and pru|dent by the help of the old one: &s;o it may prove a Cure of tho&s;e epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es of Age and Youth, Sourne&s;s and Madne&s;s. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Po&s;&s;ibility of this; One alone abundantly &s;atisfies me, and con|vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> under Seventeen.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Shou'd believe my &s;elf happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me &s;o much in a Style of Compliment. It has been ob&s;erv'd of Women, that they are more &s;ubject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac|count of their being generally treated this way; but the weake&s;t Women are not more &s;o than that weak Cla&s;s of Men, who are thought to pique them|&s;elves upon their Wit.

<P>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh|bour over&s;tock'd with Vanity, yet I can|not but fancy, there are certain Times, when mo&s;t people are in a di&s;po&s;ition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a va&s;t Good a little Truth might do, &s;po|ken in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons.

I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think him&s;elf more oblig'd to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Follies. If you would make tho&s;e the Subject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wi&s;h your Letters always were.</P>
<P>I do not wonder you have hitherto found &s;ome difficulty (as you are pleas'd to &s;ay) in writing to me, &s;ince you have always cho&s;en the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my Ver&s;es which you prai&s;e &s;o much, I may truly &s;ay they had never been the cau&s;e of any Vanity in me, ex|cept what they gave me when they fir&s;t occa&s;ion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have &s;everal times &s;ince been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, the greate&s;t magnifying Gla&s;&s;es in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per|&s;on; yet even in tho&s;e, I cannot fancy my &s;elf &s;o extremely like <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as you wou'd per&s;uade me: If I mu&s;t be like him, 'tis you will make me &s;o,

by complimenting me into a better opinion of my &s;elf than I de&s;erve: They made him think he was the <HI>Son of Jupiter,</HI> and you a&s;&s;ure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can &s;ay to my honour? You &s;aid ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a &s;hare in your Af|fection, to treat me with Compliments and &s;weet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <HI>Sancho 'Panca:</HI> They had per&s;uaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t up|on but <HI>Wafers</HI> and <HI>Marmalade.</HI> In our Days, the greate&s;t obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wi&s;e Men give them their Way, and plea&s;e them as well as they can; &s;o when tho&s;e incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco|verably Be-Mus'd, the be&s;t way both to quiet them, and &s;ecure your &s;elves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the mo&s;t part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be hear|tily glad that all you &s;ay were as true, ap|ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your &s;elf, for &s;everal weighty Rea&s;ons; but for none &s;o much, as that I might be to you what you

<P>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with my Paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <HI>Mi&s;cellany</HI> of <HI>Bern.

<P>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town, your Good-Nature was the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of my confident reque&s;t; but excu&s;e me, I mu&s;t I &s;ee &s;ay no more upon this Subject, &s;ince I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with: tho' you have given me &s;ome Encouragement to hope, our Friend&s;hip tho' young might be without Shyne&s;s, or criminal Mode&s;ty; for a Friend, like a Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not to refu&s;e a Friend's kindne&s;s becau&s;e it is &s;mall or trivial: I have told you (I think) that a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady &s;aid to her poor, po|etical Gallant, that a Queen if &s;he lay with a Groom, would expect a mark of his kindne&s;s from him, tho' it were but his Curry-comb.

<P>The method of the Copy I &s;end you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I de&s;ire you to compare it by the <HI>Figures</HI> in the Margin, an&s;wer|ing to the &s;ame in this Letter.

Policy, Prudence, Maje&s;ty, Valour, Cir|cum&s;pection, Hone&s;ty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which &s;ums up all the <HI>prai&s;e, advantage,</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of Dulne&s;s in a few words, and &s;trengthens them all by the oppo&s;ition of the <HI>di&s;grace, di&s;advantage,</HI> and <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> of Wit, with which it concludes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the pre&s;ent Edition: Some of the Lines in the H.

<P>Tho' the whole be as &s;hort again as at fir&s;t, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of &s;omething in your fir&s;t Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they &s;eem'd encompa&s;s'd with too many words; and &s;ome new expre&s;s'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll &s;ee parti|cularly in the Simile of the <HI>Clock-Weights;</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It was originally thus expre&s;s'd:
<Q><L>As Clocks run fa&s;te&s;t when mo&s;t Lead is on.</L></Q>
We find it &s;o in a Letter of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Ver&s;es of his, <HI>To the Author of a Poem call'd Succe&s;&s;io,</HI> which got out in a Mi&s;cellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> died, and two after he had laid a&s;ide the whole de&s;ign of publi&s;h|ing any Poems.</NOTE>

<P>THE Compliments you make me, in regard of any incon&s;iderable Service I could do you, are very unkind, and do but tell me in other words, that my Friend has &s;o mean an opinion of me, as to think I expect acknowledgments for trifles; which upon my faith I &s;hall equally take ami&s;s, whether made to my &s;elf, or to any others.

Yet for your &s;ake I love this Life &s;o well, that I &s;hall the le&s;s think of the other; but 'tis in your power to en&s;ure my Happine&s;s in one and the other, both by your society and good Example, &s;o not only contribute to my fe|licity here, but herea&s;ter.</P>
<P>Now as to your Excu&s;e for the plain|ne&s;s of your Style, or Letter, I mu&s;t needs tell you, that Friend&s;hip is much more ac|ceptable to a true Friend than Wit, which is generally &s;al&s;e Rea&s;oning; and a Friend's reprimand often &s;hews more Friend&s;hip than his compliment: Nay Love, which is more than Friend&s;hip, is often &s;een, by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes.

in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of Happine&s;s than of Health; yet, my dear Friend, &s;et raillery or compliment a&s;ide, I can bear your ab|&s;ence (which procures your Health and Ea&s;e) better than I can your company when you are in Pain; for I cannot &s;ee you &s;o without being &s;o too. Your love to the Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope) my love to it or you, &s;ince there I can en|joy your company without &s;eeing you in Pain to give me Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure; there I can have you without Rivals or Di|&s;turbers; without the C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s too civil, or the T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s too rude; without the Noi&s;e of the Loud, and the Cen&s;ure of the Silent; and wou'd rather have you abu&s;e me there with the Truth, than at this di&s;tance with your Compliment: Since now, your bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a Friend and kindne&s;s to a Friend, is by finding fault with his Faults, and mending them by your obliging Severity. I hope (in point of your good nature) you will have no cruel Charity for tho&s;e Pa|pers of mine, you were &s;o willing to be troubled with; which I take mo&s;t infinite|ly kind of you, and &s;hall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can do more for his Friend than pre&s;erving his Reputation (nay not by pre&s;erving his Life)
<PB N="51" REF="196">
&s;ince by pre&s;erving his Life he can only make him live about three&s;core or four|&s;core Years; but by pre&s;erving his Reputa|tion, he can make him live as long as the World la&s;ts; &s;o &s;ave him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <HI>Newgate,</HI> to &s;ave them from condemnation by the Publick. Be mo&s;t kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults, and do with my Papers, as you Country-gentlemen do with your Trees, &s;la&s;h, cut, and lop-off the Excre&s;|cencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bays, that the little remainder may live the lon|ger, and increa&s;e the value of them, by di|mini&s;hing the number. I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding your compliment, which &s;ays, you take the trou|ble kindly: Such is the genero&s;ity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de|&s;ired by them to do them a kindne&s;s; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them. Wherefore you may be &s;ure to be troubled with my Letters out of Intere&s;t, if not Kindne&s;s; &s;ince mine to you will procure yours to me, &s;o that I write to you more for my own &s;ake than yours; le&s;s to make you think I write well, than to learn from

<P>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and &s;hall be very glad of the continuance of a corre&s;pondence by which I am like to be &s;o great a gainer. I hope when I have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you again in <HI>London,</HI> not only to read over the Ver&s;es I have now of yours, but more that you have written &s;ince; for I make no doubt but any one who writes &s;o well, mu&s;t write more. Not that I think the mo&s;t voluminous Poets al|ways the be&s;t, I believe the contrary is ra|ther true. I mention'd &s;omewhat to you in <HI>London</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;toral Comedy,</HI> which I &s;hould be glad to hear you had thought upon &s;ince. I find <HI>Menage</HI> in his ob&s;erva|tions upon <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s <HI>Aminta,</HI> reckons up four|&s;core Pa&s;toral Plays in <HI>Italian:</HI> And in look|ing over my old <HI>Italian</HI> Books, I find a great many Pa&s;torals and Pi&s;catory Plays, which I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Menage</HI> reckons together. I find al&s;o by <HI>Menage,</HI> that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> is not the fir&s;t that writ in that kind, he mentioning an|other before him, which he him&s;elf had never &s;een, nor indeed have I. But as the <HI>Aminta, Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> and <HI>Filli di Sciro</HI> of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> are the three be&s;t, &s;o I think there

is no di&s;pute but <HI>Aminta</HI> is the be&s;t of the three: Not but that the Di&s;cour&s;es in <HI>Pa|&s;tor Fido</HI> are more entertaining and copious in &s;everal peoples opinion, tho' not &s;o pro|per for Pa&s;toral; and the Fable of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> more &s;urprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Racan</HI>'s <HI>Bergeries</HI> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are all too full of Conceits. <HI>Rapin</HI> will have the de&s;ign of Pa&s;toral Plays to be taken from the <HI>Cyclops</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI> I am &s;ure there is nothing of this kind in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your &s;elf.

<P>I Cannot omit the fir&s;t opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing tho&s;e Papers of mine. You have no le&s;s right to correct me, than the &s;ame hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<PB N="62" REF="207">
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint|ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an|other, till they &s;tiffen and deaden the Piece. Be&s;ides to be&s;tow heightning on every part is mon&s;trous: Some parts ought to be lower than the re&s;t; and nothing looks more ri|diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, &s;eem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <HI>Weeds, Gra&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> are all laid even, and appear undi&s;tingui&s;h'd. I believe too that &s;ometimes our fir&s;t Thoughts are the be&s;t, as the fir&s;t &s;queez|ing of the Grapes makes the fine&s;t and riche&s;t Wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of Pa&s;to|ral Comedy, becau&s;e I think the Ta&s;te of our Age will not reli&s;h a Poem of that &s;ort. People &s;eek for what they call <HI>Wit,</HI> on all &s;ubjects, and in all places; not con&s;i|dering that Nature loves Truth &s;o well, that it hardly ever admits of flouri&s;hing: <HI>Con|ceit</HI> is to Nature what <HI>Paint</HI> is to Beauty; it is not only needle&s;s, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Maje&s;ty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintne&s;s of Wit: in&s;omuch that the Cri|tics have excluded it from the loftie&s;t Poet|ry, as well as the lowe&s;t, and forbid it to the Epic no le&s;s than the Pa&s;toral. I &s;hou'd certainly di&s;plea&s;e all tho&s;e who are charm'd
<PB N="63" REF="208">
with <HI>Guarini</HI> and <HI>Bonarelli,</HI> and imitate <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <HI>Fable</HI> too. If &s;urpri|&s;ing &s;hou'd have place in the &s;tory of a Pa&s;toral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <HI>Chance</HI> than of <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> Intrigue not being very con|&s;i&s;tent with that Innocence, which ought to con&s;titute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <HI>Aminta</HI> (as I re|member) but happens by meer accident; unle&s;s it be the meeting of <HI>Aminta</HI> with <HI>Syl|via</HI> at the <HI>Fountain,</HI> which is the contrivance of <HI>Daphne,</HI> and even that is the mo&s;t &s;imple in the world: The contrary is ob&s;ervable in <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> where <HI>Cori&s;ca</HI> is &s;o perfect a Mi&s;tre&s;s of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to pa&s;s without her. I am inclin'd to think the Pa&s;toral Come|dy has another di&s;advantage, as to the <HI>Man|ners:</HI> Its general de&s;ign is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, &s;o that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara|cter mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure deba&s;e it; and hence it may come to pa&s;s, that even the virtuous Characters will not &s;hine &s;o much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra|ries.&mdash;The&s;e Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have rea&s;on to doubt
<PB N="64" REF="209">
them: but I hope your Judgment will &s;et me right.</P>
<P>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an|other point: It is how far the liberty of <HI>Borrowing</HI> may extend? I have defended it &s;ometimes by &s;aying, that it &s;eems not &s;o much the Perfection of Sen&s;e, to &s;ay things that have <HI>never</HI> been &s;aid before, as to ex|pre&s;s tho&s;e <HI>be&s;t</HI> that have been &s;aid <HI>oftene&s;t;</HI> and that Writers in the ca&s;e of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them|&s;elves wou'd produce only one &s;ort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flouri&s;h; but then Poets like Mer|chants, &s;hou'd repay with &s;omething of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de|&s;ire you to tell me &s;incerely, if I have not &s;tretch'd this Licence too far in the&s;e Pa|&s;torals? I hope to become a Critic by your Preceps, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have &s;een your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, &s;o long as you give me leave to profe&s;s my &s;elf</P>

<P>I Had &s;ooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the &s;ame time of my Journey to <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en|gag'd to go to my Corporation of <HI>Rich|mond</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> I think you are per|fectly in the right in your Notions of Pa&s;toral, but I am of opinion, that the re|dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what plea&s;es the common people, is not what ever plea&s;es the be&s;t judges. <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido</HI> indeed has had more admirers than <HI>Aminta;</HI> but I will venture to &s;ay, there is a great deal of difference between the admi|rers of one and the other. <HI>Cori&s;ca,</HI> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pa&s;torl; and <HI>Bo|narelli</HI>'s fancy of making his Shepherde&s;s in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Borrowing;</HI> 'tis very evident the be&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have extended this very far; and none &s;o far as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who is the be&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="211">
of them. As for the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, if we cannot trace them &s;o plainly, 'tis perhaps becau&s;e we have none before them; 'tis evi|dent that mo&s;t of them borrow'd from <HI>Ho|mer,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> has been accus'd of burn|ing tho&s;e that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be di&s;cover'd. The be&s;t of the modern Poets in all Languages, are tho&s;e that have the neare&s;t copied the An|cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are &s;o obvious (at lea&s;t if they are natural) that whoever writes la&s;t, mu&s;t write things like what have been &s;aid before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat|ing and drinking, and accu&s;e the Moderns of having &s;tol'n tho&s;e Inventions from them; it being evident in all &s;uch ca&s;es, that whoever live fir&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q><L>&mdash;unus &amp; alter A&s;&s;uitur pannus,</L></Q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts &s;tol'n, and all the re&s;t is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very fooli&s;h figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Antients &s;o mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can di&s;tin|gui&s;h the one from the other, I can never
<PB N="67" REF="212">
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif|ferent opinion, and that I have &s;hewn your Ver&s;es to &s;ome who have made that obje|ction to them. I have &s;o much Company round me while I write this, and &s;uch a noi&s;e in my ears, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould write any thing but Non&s;en&s;e, &s;o mu&s;t break off abruptly.

<P>AT my return from the North I re|ceiv'd the favour of your Letter, which had lain there till then.

will make them yet better again&s;t Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Ver&s;es till he takes away the true Spirit of them; e&s;pecially if he &s;ubmits to the correction of &s;ome who pa&s;s for great Critics, by me|chanical Rules, and never enter into the true De&s;ign and Genius of an Author. I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <HI>Horace,</HI> who cry <HI>Virgil</HI> wants fancy, and that <HI>Homer</HI> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com|mon rate of mortals; but generally they are great admirers of <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Lucan;</HI> and when they write them&s;elves, we find out all the My&s;tery. They &s;can their Ver&s;es upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the fir&s;t may be la&s;t, or the la&s;t fir&s;t, without any &s;ort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no De&s;ign, or Method, or any thing Natural or Ju&s;t. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings what&s;oever (not Poetry only) <HI>Nature</HI> is to be follow'd; and we &s;hou'd be jealous of our &s;elves for being &s;ond of <HI>Similes, Conceits,</HI> and what they call &s;aying <HI>Fine Things.</HI> When we werein the North, my Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> &s;hew'd

<P N="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve|ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may expre&s;s it &s;o) a Style of Sound. As in de|&s;cribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers &s;hou'd run ea&s;y and &s;lowing: in de&s;cribing a rough Torrent or Deluge, &s;onorous and &s;wel|ling,
<PB N="71" REF="216">
and &s;o of the re&s;t. This is evident every where in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and no where el&s;e that I know of to any ob&s;ervable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <HI>Vida.</HI><Q><L>Molle viam tacito lap&s;u per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine &s;ub&s;idendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempe&s;tate&s;que &s;onoras.</L>
<L>Immen&s;o cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle &s;ine ictu, Conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape &s;axa manu, cape robora Pa&s;tor,</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite pe&s;tem.</L></Q></P>
<P>This, I think, is what very few ob&s;erve in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder|ful force in imprinting the image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ode on St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day, entitled, <HI>Alexander</HI>'s <HI>Fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Every nice Ear, mu&s;t (I believe) have ob&s;erv'd, that in any &s;mooth <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e of ten &s;yllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pau&s;e</HI> at the fourth, fifth, or &s;ixth &s;yllable. It is
<PB N="72" REF="217">
upon the&s;e the Ear re&s;ts, and upon the ju|dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Ver&s;ification. For example,</P>
<P>At the fifth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Where-e'er thy Navy &Verbar; &s;preads her canvas Wings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the fourth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Homage to thee &Verbar; and Peace to all &s;he brings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ixth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Like Tracts of Leverets &Verbar; in Morning Snow.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now I fancy, that to pre&s;erve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pau&s;es of the 4th or 6th &s;hou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo|&s;ition of another; el&s;e it will be apt to wea|ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at lea&s;t it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite &s;o dead a weight, &s;o tires not &s;o much tho' it be continued longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <HI>Exple|tives,</HI> whether Words or Syllables, which are made u&s;e of purely to &s;upply a vacan|cy: <HI>Do</HI> before Verbs plural is ab&s;olutely &s;uch; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the &s;ame manner, which are almo&s;t always
<PB N="73" REF="218">
u&s;ed for the &s;ake of Rhime. The &s;ame Cau&s;e has occa&s;ioned the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to the &s;ame Per&s;on, which can never &s;ound &s;o graceful as either one or the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would al&s;o object to the Irruption of <HI>Alexandrine</HI> Ver&s;es of twelve &s;yllables, which I think &s;hould never be allow'd but when &s;ome remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has been too free of the&s;e, e&s;pecially in his latter Works. I am of the &s;ame opinion as to <HI>Triple Rhimes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. I could equally object to the <HI>Repetition</HI> of the &s;ame Rhimes within four or &s;ix lines of each other, as tire&s;ome to the Ear thro' their Monotony.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Mono&s;yllable-Lines,</HI> unle&s;s very art|fully managed, are &s;tiff, or langui&s;hing: but may be beautiful to expre&s;s Melancholy, Slowne&s;s, or labour.</P>
<P N="7">7. To come to the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> or Gap be|tween two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other (upon which you de&s;ire me to be particular) I think the rule in this ca&s;e is either to u&s;e the <HI>Cae&s;ura,</HI> or admit the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> ju&s;t as the Ear is lea&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="219">
&s;hock'd by either: For the <HI>Cae&s;ura</HI> &s;ome|times offends the Ear more than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> it&s;elf, and our language is naturally over|charg'd with Con&s;onants: As for example; If in this Ver&s;e,
<Q><L>The Old have Int're&s;t ever in their Eye,</L></Q>
we &s;hould &s;ay, to avoid the <HI>Hiatus,</HI>
<Q><L>But th' Old have Int're&s;t&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Hiatus</HI> which has the wor&s;t effect, is when one word ends with the &s;ame Vowel that begins the following; and next to this, tho&s;e Vowels who&s;e &s;ounds come neare&s;t to each other are mo&s;t to be avoid|ed. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know &s;ome people will think the&s;e Ob&s;ervations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro|borate them by &s;ome great Authorities, which I have met with in <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quin|tilian.</HI> In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to <HI>Herennius,</HI> are the&s;e words: <HI>Fugiemus cre|bras Vocalium concur&s;iones, quae va&s;tam at|que hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc e&s;t, Baccae aeueae amaeni&s;&s;imae impendebant.</HI> And Quintilian <HI>l.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Vocalium concur&s;us cum accidit, hiat &amp; inter&s;i&s;tit, at qua&s;i la|borat oratio.

Ca&s;t your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are &s;educing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's &s;often you, and the godly one's give you the &s;pleen: If you look upon trees, they cla&s;p in em|braces; birds and bea&s;ts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yielding and melancholy.

<P>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to &s;hew her the regard we have for another; and yet I mu&s;t own there is not a period of this Epi&s;tle but &s;quints toward another over|again&s;t it.

Mrs. <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> admires what people won|der at &s;o much? and &s;ays &s;he is ju&s;t &s;o her &s;elf: The Duche&s;s of <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> is of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phy&s;ician and a Divine, the one to in&s;pect the &s;tate of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The per&s;ons I made choice of were the in|genious Dr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> and the reverend Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> We were no &s;ooner in the room but the Party came to us dre&s;t in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi|tical imitation of Men&mdash;your &s;harp wit, my dear Si&s;ter, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my &s;elf look'd fir&s;t. The Prie&s;t you will ma|liciou&s;ly fancy was in his nature mo&s;t an Infidel, and doubted mo&s;t of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the &s;ure&s;t method of believing, &s;eeing and feel|ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of &s;nuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we &s;hould by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by &s;o doing we &s;hould be guilty of le&s;s &s;infulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="231">
The Doctor upon in&s;pection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at mo&s;t a natural one: He &s;aid upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwi&s;e, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a mo&s;t even di&s;po&s;ition, par|taking of the good qualities of both &s;exes: for &s;he is neither &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible as other Ladies, nor is he &s;o impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com|plai&s;ant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that &s;he tells the Gentlemen &s;he has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a La|dy. As a further proof of this affable di&s;|po&s;ition, he formerly receiv'd vi&s;its of the fair &s;ex in their ma&s;ques, till an imperti|nent fellow in a female di&s;gui&s;e mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he civilly promi|&s;ed at my reque&s;t, that my two &s;i&s;ters &s;hould be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your con&s;idera|tion.</P>

the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, below; and but two apartments above (very much infe|rior to them) in the whole Hou&s;e. When you look upon the out&s;ide, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you &s;ee the in&s;ide, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a hou&s;e of Entries and Pa&s;&s;a|ges; among which there are three Vi&s;ta's through the whole, very u&s;ele&s;sly hand|&s;ome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but &s;poil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the &s;ight of &s;everal of the windows. There are two ordinary &s;tair-ca&s;es in&s;tead of one great one. The be&s;t things within the hou&s;e, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the mo&s;t commodious, and the be&s;t contrived of the whole. At the top of the Building are &s;everal Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini|cal and heavy. What &s;eems of the be&s;t ta&s;te, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with the&s;e tur|rets. The two Sides of the building are intirely &s;poil'd by two mon&s;trous bow-windows which &s;tand ju&s;t in the middle, in&s;tead of doors: And as if it were fatal

<P>I will not deny, but that like <HI>Alexander,</HI> in the mid&s;t of my glory I am wounded, and find my&s;elf a meer man. To tell you

I told him 'twas what he could never have thought of, if it had not been his misfortune to be blind, and what I never could think of, while I had eyes to &s;ee both her and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude without telling you, that I will do the utmo&s;t in the affair you de&s;ire.

<P>IT is with infinite &s;atisfaction I am made acquainted that your brother will at la&s;t prove your relation, and has en|tertain'd &s;uch &s;entiments as become him in your concern. I have been prepar'd for this by degrees, having &s;everal times receiv'd from Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that which is one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures, the knowledge that others enter'd into my own &s;entiments concerning you.

As I have often condol'd with you in your adver&s;ities, &s;o I have a right which but few can pretend to, of congratulating on the pro&s;pect of your better fortunes; and I hope for the future to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felici|ties. Tho' you mode&s;tly &s;ay the world has left you, yet I verily believe it is com|ing to you again as fa&s;t as it can: For to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis pa&s;t its power to oppo&s;e it. Therefore if you &s;hould take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it, you would be &s;o far from

leading what is commonly call'd an un|&s;ettled life (and what you with too much unju&s;t &s;everity call a vagabond Life) that the wi&s;e cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progre&s;s, who travels to gain the affections he has not, or to fix tho&s;e he already has; which he effectually does wherever he &s;hews him&s;elf. But if you are re&s;olv'd in revenge to rob the world of &s;o much example as you may afford it, I be|lieve your de&s;ign will be vain; for even in a Mona&s;tery your devotions cannot carry you &s;o far towards the next world as to make This lo&s;e the &s;ight of you, but you'll be like a Star, that while it is fix'd to Hea|ven &s;hines over all the Earth.</P>

<P>I Can &s;ay little to recommend the Let|ters I &s;hall write to you, but that they will be the mo&s;t impartial repre&s;entations of a free heart, and the true&s;t copies you ever &s;aw, tho' of a very mean original. Not a feature will be &s;often'd, or any ad|vantageous light employ'd to make the ug|ly thing a little le&s;s hideous: but you &s;hall find it in all re&s;pects, mo&s;t horribly like. You will do me an inju&s;tice if you look upon any thing I &s;hall &s;ay from this in|&s;tant, as a compliment, either to you or my &s;elf: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to per&s;e|vere till death in every &s;entiment or no|tion I now &s;et down, than you would ima|gine a man's face &s;hould never change when once his picture was drawn.</P>
<P>The freedom I &s;hall u&s;e in this manner of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the be&s;t &s;ort of fools, the hone&s;t ones. And &s;ince what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in &s;pight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almo&s;t fooli&s;h to take any pains to conceal it at
<PB N="112" REF="261">
all, and almo&s;t knavi&s;h to do it from tho&s;e that are our friends. If <HI>Momus</HI>'s project had taken, of having windows in our brea&s;ts, I &s;hou'd be for carrying it further, and making tho&s;e windows; ca&s;ements; that while a man &s;how'd his heart to all the world, he might do &s;omething more for his friends, even give it them, and tru&s;t it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King <HI>Herod</HI> did <HI>Herodias</HI> (tho' I never had &s;o much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a di&s;h, as he did another's head. But &s;ince <HI>Jupiter</HI> will not have it &s;o, I mu&s;t be con|tent to &s;hew my ta&s;te in life, as I do my ta&s;te in painting, by loving to have as little drapery as po&s;&s;ible. Not that I think every body naked altogether &s;o fine a &s;ight as your &s;elf and a few more would be; but becau&s;e 'tis good to u&s;e people to what they mu&s;t be acquainted with; and there will certainly come &s;ome day of judgment or other, to uncover every &s;oul of us. We &s;hall then &s;ee that the <HI>Prues</HI> of this world ow'd all their fine figure only to their be|ing &s;trater-lac'd than the re&s;t; and that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as tho&s;e that never girded their loins at all.&mdash;But a particular rea&s;on that may engage you to write your thoughts the more free|ly to me, is, that I am confident no one
<PB N="113" REF="262">
knows you better: for I find, when o|thers expre&s;s their thoughts of you, they fall very &s;hort of mine, and I know at the &s;ame time theirs are &s;uch as you would think &s;ufficient in your favour.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine how de&s;irous I mu&s;t be of a corre&s;pondence with a per&s;on, who had taught me long ago that it was as po&s;&s;ible to e&s;teem at fir&s;t &s;ight, as to love: and who has &s;ince ruin'd me for all the conver&s;ation of one &s;ex, and almo&s;t all the friend&s;hip of the other. I am but too &s;en&s;ible, thro' your means, that the com|pany of men wants a certain &s;oftne&s;s to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing el&s;e. How often have I been quietly going to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tranquillity and indolence I had &s;o long found in the country; when one evening of your conver&s;ation has &s;poil'd me for a <HI>Soli|taire!</HI> Books have lo&s;t their effect upon me, and I was convinced, &s;ince I &s;aw you, that there is one alive wi&s;er than all the Sages: a plague of female wi&s;dom! it makes a man ten times more unea&s;y than his own. What is very &s;trange, Virtue her&s;elf (when you have the dre&s;&s;ing her) is too amiable for one's repo&s;e. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have &s;een you to have conver&s;ed with you; they
<PB N="114" REF="263">
would have been &s;trangely bit, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair La|dy, and you had bewitch'd them with Rea&s;on and Virtue (two Beauties that the very Fops pretend to have no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy di&s;tance at which we cor|re&s;pond, removes a great many of tho&s;e re&s;trictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conver&s;ation prejudice truth, to &s;ave good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blu&s;h; we conver&s;e upon &s;uch unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, &s;hame, or de|&s;ign, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impo&s;e (even in a &s;ingle thought) upon each other in this &s;tate of &s;eparation, as for Spirits of a different &s;phere who have &s;o little inter|cour&s;e with us, to employ that little (as &s;ome would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delu&s;ions upon poor mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a que&s;tion, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than mo&s;t in&s;tances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the la&s;t hour I &s;aw you? What degree of concern did I di&s;cover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will

never feel, that of parting from what one mo&s;t e&s;teems? for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greate&s;t of all the hypocrites that ever decency made.</P>
<P>I never &s;ince pa&s;s by your hou&s;e but with the &s;ame &s;ort of melancholy that we feel upon &s;eeing the Tomb of a friend, which only &s;erves to put us in mind of what we have lo&s;t. I reflect upon the circum&s;tances of your departure, which I was there a wit|ne&s;s of (your behaviour in what I may call your la&s;t moments) and I indulge a gloo|my kind of plea&s;ure in thinking that tho&s;e la&s;t moments were given to me. I would fain imagine this was not accidental, but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have, in finding out the truth of people's &s;entiments; and that you were willing, the la&s;t man that <HI>would have</HI> par|ted from you, &s;hould be that la&s;t that <HI>did.</HI> I really look'd upon you ju&s;t as the friends of <HI>Curtius</HI> might have done upon that Hero, at the in&s;tant when he was devoting him|&s;elf to Glory, and running to be lo&s;t out of genero&s;ity. I was obliged to admire your re&s;olution, in as great a degree as I de|plored it; and had only to wi&s;h, that Hea|ven would reward &s;o much Virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could enjoy el&s;ewhere!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO convince you how little pain I give my&s;elf, in corre&s;ponding with Men of good Nature, and good Under|&s;tanding, you &s;ee I omit to an&s;wer your Letters till a time, when another Man would be a&s;hamed to own he had received

them. If therefore you are ever moved on my Account by that Spirit, which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague, I mean the Spirit of Goodne&s;s, pray never &s;tint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Civility beyond my natural Inclina|tion: I dare tru&s;t you, Sir, not only with my Folly when I write, but with my Neg|ligence when I do not; and expect equally your Pardon for either.</P>
<P>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the re&s;t of this Paper, it &s;hould be &s;potted and diver&s;ified with Conceits all over; you &s;hould be put out of Breath with Laughter at each Sentence, and pau&s;e at each Period, to look back over how much Wit you had pa&s;s'd. But I have found by Experience, that People now a-days regard Writing as little as they do Preaching: The mo&s;t we can hope is to be heard, ju&s;t with Decency and Patience, once a Week, by Folks in the Country: Here in Town we hum over a Piece of fine Writing, and we whi&s;tle at a Sermon. The Stage is the only Place we &s;eem alive at; there indeed we &s;tare, and roar, and clap Hands for K. <HI>George</HI> and the Government. As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty, they are an ob&s;olete Train, &s;o ill-dre&s;s'd, that Men, Women, and Chil|dren, hi&s;s 'em out of all good Company. Humility knocks &s;o &s;neakingly at the Door,
<PB N="125" REF="274">
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride, Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> from having ru&s;ti|cated in your Company too long, really behaves her&s;elf &s;candalou&s;ly among us: She pretends to open her Eyes for the Sake of &s;eeing the Sun, and to &s;leep becau&s;e it is Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn|ing, and is thought to have &s;aid her Prayers before; talks without any manner of Shame of good Books, and has not &s;een <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Play of the <HI>Non-juror.</HI> I rejoiced the other Day to &s;ee a Libel on her Toilette, which gives me &s;ome Hope that you have at lea&s;t a Ta&s;te of Scandal left you, in Defect of all other Vices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole Matter, I heartily wi&s;h you well; but as I cannot entirely de&s;ire the Ruin of all the Joys of this City, &s;o all that remains is to wi&s;h you wou'd keep your Happine&s;s to your &s;elves, that the happie&s;t here may not die with Envy at a Bli&s;s which they cannot attain to.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU'LL think me very full of my &s;elf, when after a long Silence (which
<PB N="126" REF="275">
however to &s;ay Truth has rather been em|ploy'd to contemplate of you, than to for|get you) I begin to talk of my own Works. I find it is in the fini&s;hing a Book, as in concluding a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, one al|ways thinks it will be very &s;oon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd for Incidents to retard the clearing <HI>any publick Account,</HI> and &s;o I &s;ee it is in mine. I have plagued my&s;elf, like great Mini&s;ters, with undertaking too much for one Man, and with a De&s;ire of doing more than was ex|pected from me, have done le&s;s than I ought.</P>
<P>For having de&s;ign'd four very laborious and uncommon &s;orts of Indexes to <HI>Homer,</HI> I'm forc'd, for want of Time, to publi&s;h two only; the De&s;ign of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully executed. I've al&s;o been oblig'd to leave unfini&s;h'd in my Desk the Heads of two E&s;&s;ays, one on the <HI>Theology</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and another on the <HI>Oratory</HI> of <HI>Ho|mer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> So they mu&s;t wait for fu|ture Editions, or peri&s;h; and (one Way or other, no great Matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI></P>
<P>I think of you every Day, I a&s;&s;ure you, even without &s;uch good Memorials of you as your Si&s;ters, with whom I &s;ometimes talk of you, and find it one of the mo&s;t agree|able of all Subjects to them. My Lord
<PB N="127" REF="276">
<HI>Digby</HI> mu&s;t be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil|dren. There needs no more than an Ac|quaintance with your Family, to make all Elder Sons wi&s;h they had Fathers to their Lives-end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the Subject of filial Love, without putting you in mind of an old Woman, who has a &s;incere, hearty, old-fa&s;hion'd Re&s;pect for you, and con|&s;tantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner, to tell you &s;o.</P>
<P>I very much wi&s;h (but what &s;ignifies my wi&s;hing? my Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> wi&s;hes, your Si&s;ter's wi&s;h) that you were with us, to com|pare the beautiful Contra&s;t this Sea&s;on af|fords us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what <HI>Twickenham</HI> is (and what your Friend Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> of <HI>Twickenham</HI> is) in this warmer Sea&s;on. Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun, at the &s;ame time that its Banks re|tain the Verdure of Showers: Our Gardens are offering their fir&s;t No&s;egays; our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought happily together, are &s;tretching their Arms to meet each other, and growing nearer and nearer every Hour: The Birds are paying their thank&s;giving Songs for the new Habita|tions I have made 'em: My Building rites

high enough to attract the Eye and Curi|o&s;ity of the Pa&s;&s;enger from the River, where, upon beholding a Mixture of Beauty and Ruin, he enquires what Hou&s;e is falling, or what Church is ri&s;ing? So little ta&s;te have our common Tritons of <HI>Vitruvius;</HI> whatever Delight the true, un&s;een, poeti|cal Gods of the River may take, in re|flecting on their Streams my <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> Porti|cos, or <HI>Ionic</HI> Pila&s;ters.</P>
<P>But (to de&s;cend from all this Pomp of Style) the be&s;t Account I can give of what I am building, is, that it will afford me a few plea&s;ant Rooms for &s;uch a Friend as your&s;elf, or a cool Situation for an Hour or two for Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> when &s;he will do me the Honour (at this Publick Hou&s;e on the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</P>
<P>The Moment I am writing this, I am &s;urprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talking of, a meer Je&s;t! Build|ings, Gardens, Writings, Plea&s;ures, Works, of whatever &s;tuff Man can rai&s;e! none of them (God knows) capable of advanta|ging a Creature that is mortal, or of &s;ati&s;|fying a Soul that is immortal!

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Doctor is going to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and &s;tays a Fortnight or more: Per|haps you would be comforted to have a Sight of him, whether you need him or not. I think him as good a Doctor as any for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than any for one that is well. He would do admirably for Mrs. <HI>Mary Digby:</HI> She need|ed only to follow his Hints, to be in eter|nal Bu&s;ine&s;s and Amu&s;ement of Mind, and even as active as &s;he could de&s;ire. But in|deed I fear &s;he would out-walk him: For (as Dean <HI>Swift</HI> ob&s;erv'd to me the very fir&s;t time I &s;aw the Doctor) <HI>He is a Man that can do every thing but walk.</HI> His Brother, who is lately come into <HI>England,</HI> goes al&s;o to the <HI>Bath;</HI> and is a more extraordinary Man than he, worth your going thither on purpo&s;e to know him. The Spirit of <HI>Phi|lanthropy,</HI> &s;o long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him: He is a Philo&s;opher all of Fire; &s;o warmly, nay &s;o wildly in the Right, that he &s;orces all others about him to be &s;o too, and draws them into his
<PB N="132" REF="281">
own <HI>Vortex.</HI> He is a Star that looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Banignity, all gentle and beneficial Influence. If there be other Men in the World that would &s;erve a Friend, yet he is the only one I believe that could make even an Enemy &s;erve a Friend.</P>
<P>As all human Life is chequer'd and mix'd with Acqui&s;itions and Lo&s;&s;es (though the latter are more certain and irremediable, than the former la&s;ting or &s;atisfactory) &s;o at the time I have gain'd the Acquaintance of one worthy Man I have lo&s;t another, a very ea&s;y, human, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr. <HI>Stonor.</HI> It's certain the Lo&s;s of one of this Character puts us na|turally upon &s;etting a greater Value on the &s;ew that are left, though the Degree of our E&s;teem may be different. Nothing, &s;ays <HI>Seneca,</HI> is &s;o melancholy a Circum&s;tance in human Life, or &s;o &s;oon reconciles us to to the Thought of our own Death, as the Reflection and Pro&s;pect of one Friend af|ter another dropping round us! Who would &s;tand alone, the &s;ole remaining Ruin, the la&s;t tottering Column of all the Fabrick of Friend&s;hip; once &s;o large, &s;eemingly &s;o &s;trong, and yet &s;o &s;uddenly &s;unk and buried?</P>

her the future, and as yet vi&s;ionary Beau|ties, that are to ri&s;e in tho&s;e Scenes: The Palace that is to be built, the Pa|villions that are to glitter, the Colonnades that are to adorn them: Nay more, the meeting of the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Severn,</HI> which (when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' &s;ecret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till they ri&s;e and openly celebrate their Mar|riage in the mid&s;t of an immen&s;e Amphi|theatre, which is to be the Admiration of Po&s;terity a hundred Years hence.

<P>The Objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different Na|ture.

The Matrons, like tho&s;e of <HI>Sparta,</HI> attend their Sons to the Field, to be the Witne&s;&s;es of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens

with all their Charms di&s;play'd, provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee &s;upply the place of <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> black Broth.

<P>I Know of nothing that will be &s;o Inte|re&s;&s;ing to you at pre&s;ent, as &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of the la&s;t Act of that eminent Comic Poet, and our Friend, <HI>Wycherley.</HI> He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would marry as &s;oon as his life was de&s;pair'd of. Accord|ingly a few days before his Death he un|derwent the Ceremony; and join'd together tho&s;e two Sacraments which wi&s;e Men &s;ay &s;hould be the la&s;t we receive; for if you ob|&s;erve, Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme

Unction in our Catechi&s;m, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken. The old Man then lay down, &s;atisfy'd in the Con&s;cience of having, by this one Act paid his ju&s;t Debts, obliged a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and &s;hewn a heroic re&s;entment of the ill u&s;age of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, di&s;charg|ed tho&s;e Debts; a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompence; and the Nephew he left to comfort him&s;elf as well as he could, with the mi&s;erable Remains of a mortgaged E&s;tate. I &s;aw our Friend twice after this was done, le&s;s peevi&s;h in his Sickne&s;s than he u&s;ed to be in his Health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been more likely) much a&s;hamed of marrying. The Evening before he ex|pired, he called his young Wife to the bed|&s;ide, and earne&s;tly entreated her not to deny him one reque&s;t, the la&s;t he &s;hould make. Upon her A&s;&s;urances of con&s;enting to it, he told her, <HI>My Dear, it is only this; that you will never marry an old Man again.</HI> I can|not help remarking, that Sickne&s;s which often de&s;troys both Wit and Wi&s;dom, yet &s;eldom has power to remove that Talent which we call <HI>Humour:</HI> Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> &s;hew'd his, even in this la&s;t Compliment; tho' I think his reque&s;t a little hard; for

<P>I AM ju&s;t return'd from the Country, whither Mr <HI>Rowe</HI> accompanied me, and pa&s;s'd a Week in the Fore&s;t. I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me; but I mu&s;t acquaint you there is a Vi|vacity and Gaiety of Di&s;po&s;ition almo&s;t pe|culiar to him, which make it impo&s;&s;ible to part from him without that unea&s;ine&s;s which
<PB N="153" REF="302">
generally &s;ucceeds all our plea&s;ures. I have been ju&s;t taking a &s;olitary walk by moon|&s;hine, full of reflections on the tran&s;itory na|ture of all human delights; and giving my Thoughts a loo&s;e in the contemplation of tho&s;e Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter ta&s;te in the Company of &s;eparate Spirits, when we &s;hall range the walks a|bove, and perhaps gaze on this World at as va&s;t a di&s;tance as we now do on tho&s;e Worlds. The plea&s;ures we are to enjoy in that Conver&s;ation mu&s;t undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro|ceed from the Di&s;coveries each &s;hall commu|nicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the Happine&s;s of Minds can &s;urely be nothing but Knowledge.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t Gratification we receive from Company is <HI>Mirth,</HI> which at the be&s;t is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that beats about the brea&s;t for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty.</P>
<P>Keeping good Company, even the be&s;t, is but a le&s;s &s;hameful Art of lo&s;ing Time</P>
<P>What we here call <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> are little better: The greater number of Arts to which we apply our&s;elves are mere grop|ing in the Dark; and even the &s;earch of our mo&s;t important Concerns in a future being, is but a needle&s;s, anxious, and uncertain ha&s;te to be knowing, &s;ooner than we can,
<PB N="154" REF="303">
what without all this &s;ollicitude we &s;hall know a little later. We are but <HI>Curious Impertinents</HI> in the ca&s;e of Futurity. 'Tis not our bu&s;ine&s;s to be gue&s;&s;ing what the State of Souls &s;hall be, but to be doing what may make our own State happy; We cannot be Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science, Divinity; you will be &s;o civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stre&s;s up|on the re&s;t. Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other u&s;e, than Hor&s;es of the Bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they to&s;s their Heads as if they were proud of 'em) only to jogg on a little more merrily.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervations on the narrow concep|tions of Mankind in the point of Friend|&s;hip, confirm me in what I was &s;o fortu|nate as at my fir&s;t knowledge of you to hope, and &s;ince &s;o amply to experience. Let me take &s;o much decent Pride and Dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini|ons like the&s;e, which I di&s;cover'd in your Mind, I had never made the Trial I have done; which has &s;ucceeded &s;o much to mine, and I believe not le&s;s to your Satisfaction: For if I know you right, your Plea&s;ure is greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="304">
Your Remark, that the Variety of opini|on in Politics or Religion is often rather a Gratification than Objection, to people who have Sen&s;e enough to con&s;ider the beau|tiful order of Nature in her Variations; makes me think you have not con&s;trued <HI>Joannes Secundus</HI> wrong, in the Ver&s;e which precedes that which you quote; <HI>Bene nota Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way &s;ignify the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Religion, tho' <HI>Secundus</HI> was of it. I think it was generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of wor&s;hipping him, which divided the whole World.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find that a real Concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing too: The more time we give our &s;elves to think over one's own, or a Friend's unhappi|ne&s;s, the more unable we grow to expre&s;s the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a Letter, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on as this, as to retard a melancholy Vi&s;it to a Per&s;on one cannot relieve. One is a&s;hamed in that Circum&s;tance, to pretend to entertain peo|ple with trifling, in&s;ignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand, or un&s;ea&s;onable and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things &s;acred; to treat &s;o &s;olemn a matter as a generous vo|luntary Suffering, with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as your's has no need of being &s;pirited up into Honour, or like a weak Woman, prai&s;ed into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis enough to do and &s;uffer what we ought; and Men &s;hould know, that the noble pow|er of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemi&s;h'd Con&s;cience and inflexible Re&s;olution are
<PB N="162" REF="306">
above an accidental Flow of Spirits, or a &s;ud|den Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mankind be included in Re&s;igna|tion to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel|low-Creatures; there are now &s;ome People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practi&s;ing the one, as them&s;elves have given an infamous In&s;tance of the Violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has always this Comfort when he is oppre&s;t, that he knows him&s;elf to be &s;uperior to tho&s;e who injure him: For the greate&s;t Power on Earth can no &s;ooner do him that Injury, but the brave Man can make him&s;elf greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to &s;eek for allevia|ting Con&s;olations in a Calamity of &s;o much Glory, one might &s;ay that to be ruin'd thus in the Gro&s;s, with a whole People, is but like peri&s;hing in the General Conflagration, where nothing we can value is left behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks in our pre&s;ent Condition, the mo&s;t heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's Load, and (oppre&s;t as we are) to &s;uccour &s;uch as are yet more oppre&s;t. If there are too many who cannot be a&s;&s;i&s;ted but by what we cannot give, our Money; there are yet others who may be relieved by our Coun|&s;el, by our Countenance, and even by our

Chearfulne&s;s. The Misfortunes of private Families, the Mi&s;under&s;tandings of People whom Di&s;tre&s;&s;es make &s;u&s;picious, the Cold|ne&s;&s;es of Relations whom Change of Reli|gion may di&s; unite, or the Nece&s;&s;ities of half|ruin'd E&s;tates render unkind to each other; the&s;e at lea&s;t may be &s;often'd in &s;ome de|grees, by a general well-manag'd Humanity among our&s;elves, if all tho&s;e who have your Principles of Belief, had al&s;o your Sen&s;e and Conduct. But indeed mo&s;t of 'em have given lamentable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI></NOTE> proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Sen&s;e, are only religious thro' Weakne&s;s, and good-natur'd thro' Shame: The&s;e are narrow-minded Creatures that never deal in E&s;&s;entials; their Faith never looks be|yond Ceremonials, nor their Charity be|yond Relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, con&s;cientious <HI>French</HI> Refugee at this in&s;tant: what mu&s;t my Concern then be, when I perceive &s;o many Anxieties now tearing tho&s;e Hearts which I have de&s;ired a place in, and Clouds of Melancholy ri&s;ing on tho&s;e Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection? I begin already to feel both what &s;ome ap|prehend, and what others are yet too &s;tu|pid

I grieve with the Old, for &s;o many additional Inconveniences, and Chagrins, more than their &s;mall Remain of Life &s;eem'd de&s;tin'd to undergo; and with the Young, for &s;o many of tho&s;e Gayeties and Plea&s;ures (the Portion of Youth) which they will by this means be depriv'd of.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very kind and obliging man|ner of enquiring after me, among the fir&s;t Concerns of Life, at your Re&s;u&s;citation, &s;hould have been &s;ooner an&s;wer'd and ac|knowledg'd. I &s;incerely rejoice at your re|covery from an Illne&s;s which gave me le&s;s pain than it did you, only from my Igno|rance of it. I &s;hould have el&s;e been &s;eri|ou&s;ly and deeply affected, in the thought of your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a private Letter of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> giving an account of the la&s;t words of an intimate Friend of his: <Q REND="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain I feel will &s;oon be over, but I grieve for
<PB N="175" REF="319">
that you are to feel, which is to la&s;t you for life.'</Q></P>
<P>I join with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man &s;ome|what longer. The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoune</HI> &s;aid one day to me: <Q REND="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to die; I am a poor Individual; no Creature to wi&s;h, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only rea&s;on I have to repent be|ing a &s;ingle Man; now I grow old, I am like a Tree without a Prop, and without young Trees of my own &s;hedding, to grow round me, for Company and Defence.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope the Gout will &s;oon go after the Fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an Interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards, except the Gout. Pray come, and never &s;tir from us again. Do away your dirty Acres, ca&s;t 'em to dirty People, &s;uch as in the Scripture-Phra&s;e <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s the Land.</HI> Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in <HI>Milton.</HI><Q><L>The tawny Lyon, pawing to get free</L>

Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the Ru&s;tic Manner; and from that di&s;tance un|der the Temple you look down thro' a &s;lop|ing Arcade of Trees, and &s;ee the Sails on the River pa&s;&s;ing &s;uddenly and vani&s;hing, as thro' a Per&s;pective Gla&s;s.

There are connected to this Grotto by a narrower Pa&s;|&s;age two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one toward the River, of &s;mooth Stones, full of light and open; the other toward the Arch of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints, and Iron Ore. The Bottom is paved with &s;imple Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil|derne&s;s to the Temple, is to be Cockle-&s;hells, in the natural Ta&s;te, agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place.

<P>JUST as I receiv'd yours, I was &s;et down to write to you with &s;ome &s;hame that I had &s;o long deferr'd it. But I can hardly repent my neglect, when it
<PB N="189" REF="333">

Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn of a No&s;e or Ear, the &s;malle&s;t degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim|ple, have charms to di&s;tract me. I no long|er look upon Lord <HI>Plau&s;ible</HI> as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow (as the <HI>Plain-dealer</HI> has it) but am in &s;ome danger even from the Ugly and Di&s;agreeable, &s;ince they may have their retired beauties, in one Trait or other about 'em. You may gue&s;s in how unea&s;y a &s;tate I am, when every day the per|formances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more de&s;pica|ble. I have thrown away three Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s, each of which was once my vanity, two Lady <HI>Bridgewaters,</HI> a Dutche&s;s of <HI>Montague,</HI> be&s;ides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight of the Garter.

However, I comfort my &s;elf with a Chri|&s;tian Reflection, that I have not broken the Commandment, for my Pictures are not the likene&s;s of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the waters under the earth.

<P>I HAVE been perpetually troubled with &s;ickne&s;s of late, which has made me &s;o melancholy, that the Immortality of the Soul has been my con&s;tant Speculation, as the Mortality of my Body my con&s;tant Plague. In good earne&s;t, <HI>Seneca</HI> is nothing to a fit of illne&s;s.</P>

<P>I Think it obliging in you to de&s;ire an account of my health.

I not only fre|quently think of you, but con&s;tantly do my be&s;t to make others do it, by mentioning

I de&s;ire you to do the &s;ame for me to tho&s;e you are now with: do me what you think Ju&s;tice in regard to tho&s;e who are my friends; and if there are any, whom I have unwilling|ly de&s;erved &s;o little of, as to be my Ene|mies, I don't de&s;ire you to forfeit their opi|nion or your own judgment in any ca&s;e.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;omething like the Sun at this Sea|&s;on, withdrawing from the World, but meaning it mighty well, and re&s;olving to &s;hine whenever I can again. But I fear the Clouds of a long Winter will over|come me to &s;uch a degree, that any body will take a farthing-candle for a better Guide, and more &s;erviceable companion. My Friends may remember my brighter days, but will think (like the <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI>) that the <HI>Moon</HI> is a better thing when once I am gone. I don't &s;ay this with any allu&s;ion to my Poetical capacity as a Son of <HI>Apolio,</HI> but in my Companionable one, (if you'll &s;uffer me to u&s;e a phra&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s) For I &s;hall &s;ee or be &s;een of few of you, this Winter. I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea|&s;ure. I not only, as <HI>Dryden</HI> fairly &s;ays, <HI>Feel my Notes decay</HI> as a Poet; but feel my Spirits flag as a Companion, and &s;hall re|turn again to where I fir&s;t began, my Books. I have been putting my Library in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my Mind and Body (if I can) to &s;ome Life. A Friend,
<PB N="222" REF="366">
(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have &s;pent three or four hours a day the&s;e fifteen years, advi&s;ed me to pa&s;s more time in my &s;tudies: I reflected, &s;he mu&s;t have found &s;ome Rea&s;on for this admoni|tion, and concluded &s;he wou'd compleat all her kindne&s;&s;es to me by returning me to the Employment I am fitte&s;t for; Con|ver&s;ation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your life with my &s;tupid &s;tate. For as to my living at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> with Ladies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is all a dream; I was there but two nights and all the day out of that company. I &s;hall certainly make as little Court to others, as they do to me; and that will be none at all. My Fair-Weather-Friends of the Sum|mer are going away for <HI>London,</HI> and I &s;hall &s;ee Them and the Butterflies together, if I live till next Year; which I would not de&s;ire to do, if it were only for their &s;akes. But we that are writers, ought to love Po|&s;terity, that Po&s;terity may love us; and I would willingly live to &s;ee the Children of the pre&s;ent Race, meerly in hope they may be a little wi&s;er than their Parents.</P>

<PB N="224" REF="368">
In any of the&s;e Ca&s;es, indeed, I might have judged him too pre&s;umptuous, and perhaps have trembled for his Ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this &s;mall and mode&s;t Epi&s;tle, which attacks <HI>no one Vice</HI> what&s;oever; which deals only in <HI>Folly,</HI> and not Folly in general, but a &s;ingle Spe|cies of it; that only Branch, for the oppo|&s;ite Excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be cele|brated.

<L>Health to him&s;elf, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q>Is this &s;uch a <HI>Crime,</HI> that to impute it to a Man mu&s;t be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an <HI>Innocent Folly,</HI> and much more <HI>Beneficent</HI> than the Want of it; for <HI>Ill Ta&s;te</HI> employs more hands, and diffu&s;es Expence more than a <HI>Good</HI> one. Is it a <HI>Moral</HI> Defect? No, it is but a <HI>Natural</HI> one; a <HI>Want of Ta&s;te.</HI> It is what the be&s;t good Man living may be liable to: The worthie&s;t Peer may live ex|emplarily in an ill-favour'd Hou&s;e, and the be&s;t reputed Citizen be plea&s;ed with a vile Garden. I thought (I &s;ay) the Author had
<PB N="225" REF="369">
the common Liberty to ob&s;erve a Defect, and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that di&s;tingui&s;hes him: which I know not how any Quality &s;hould do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But, they &s;ay, the Satire is <HI>Per&s;onal.</HI> I thought it could not be &s;o, becau&s;e all its Reflexions are on <HI>Things.</HI> His Reflexions are not on the <HI>Man,</HI> but his Hou&s;e, Garden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, he re&s;pects (as one may &s;ay) the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the Nile and the Triton: He is only &s;orry to &s;ee them (as he might be to &s;ee any of his <HI>Friends</HI>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy, that to &s;ay a Thing is <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> is the &s;ame as to &s;ay it is <HI>Unju&s;t,</HI> not con&s;idering, that no|thing can be <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> that, is not <HI>Per&s;onal.</HI> I am afraid that <Q REND="inline">"all &s;uch Writings and Di&s;cour|&s;es as <HI>touch no Man,</HI> will <HI>mend no Man.</HI>"</Q> The Good-Natured, indeed, are apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire; and the <HI>Guilty</HI> readily concur with the <HI>Weak</HI> for a plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Vicious look upon Folly as their <HI>Frontier:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Jam proximus ardet</L>

No wonder tho&s;e who know Ridicule be|longs to them, find an inward Con&s;olation

in removing it from them&s;elves as far as they can; and it is never &s;o far, as when they can get it fixed on the <HI>be&s;t Characters.</HI> No wonder tho&s;e who are Food for Satiri&s;ts, &s;hould rail at them as Creatures of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> every Bea&s;t born for our U&s;e would be rea|dy to call a Man &s;o.</P>
<P>I know no Remedy, unle&s;s people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres, as they begin to do the Churches; un|le&s;s Comedy were for&s;aken, Satire &s;ilent, and every man left to do what &s;eems good in his own Eyes, as if there were no King, no Prie&s;t, no Poet in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>But I find my&s;elf obliged to touch a Point, on which I mu&s;t be more &s;erious; it well de&s;erves I &s;hould: I mean the malicious Ap|plication of the Character of <HI>Timon,</HI> which I will boldly &s;ay, they would impute to the Per&s;on the mo&s;t different in the World from a <HI>Man-hater,</HI> and the Per&s;on who&s;e <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Wit</HI> have often been &s;hewn in the <HI>righte&s;t Place.</HI> The Author of that Epi&s;tle mu&s;t certainly think &s;o, if he has the &s;ame Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have; for he has been favoured by this very Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Why, in God's Name, mu&s;t a <HI>Portrait,</HI> apparently collected from twenty different Men, be applied to one only? Has it his <HI>Eye?</HI> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <HI>No&s;e</HI>

<P>Could there be a more melancholy In|&s;tance how much the Ta&s;te of the Publick is vitiated, and turns the mo&s;t &s;alutary and &s;ea&s;onable Phy&s;ick into Poi&s;on, than if amid&s;t the Blaze of a thou&s;and bright Qualities in a Great Man, they &s;hould only remark there is a <HI>Shadow</HI> about him, as what Eminence is without?

<P>I know no man who would be more concerned, if he gave the lea&s;t Pain or Offence to any innocent Per&s;on; and none who would be le&s;s concerned, if the Sa|tire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it, If ever that hap|pens, I dare engage he will own it, with all the Freedom of one who&s;e <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> are <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and who &s;ets his <HI>Name</HI> to them.</P>

<P>I Have been &s;o well &s;atisfy'd with the Country ever &s;ince I &s;aw you, that I have not &s;o much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and your&s;elf. And from him I under&s;tand of your Journey this Sum|mer into <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> from whence I gue&s;s you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Bu&s;ine&s;s of comparing Critics, and re|conciling
<PB N="239" REF="383">
reconciling commentators; and to the old diver&s;ions of a lo&s;ing game at Picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Hearing.</NOTE>Sen&s;e which there for the mo&s;t part could only &s;erve to di&s;gu&s;t you, enjoy the vigour of another which ravi&s;hes you.
<Q><L>You know when one Sen&s;e is &s;uppre&s;t,</L>

<P>(According to the poetical, not the learn|ed, <HI>Dodwell;</HI> who has done one thing wor|thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not non&s;en&s;e!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the Boxes, without being trou|bled with any of the dulne&s;s of the Stage. You are &s;o good a critic, that 'tis the great|e&s;t happine&s;s of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not &s;o arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the re&s;t) without hearing. But now I talk of tho&s;e critics, I have good news to tell you concerning my&s;elf, for which I expect you &s;hou'd congratulate with me: It is, that beyond all my expectations, and
<PB N="240" REF="384">
far above my demerits, I have been mo&s;t mercifully repriev'd by the &s;overeign power of <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on,</HI> from being brought forth to publick puni&s;hment; and re&s;pited from time to time from the hands of tho&s;e bar|barous executioners of the Mu&s;es, whom I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver them&s;elves into the hands of Ju|&s;tice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their di&s;advantage; and not out of any Ambition to &s;pread their fame, by be|ing executed in the face of the world, which is a fame but of &s;hort continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to pre&s;erve his for ninety-nine years; for tho&s;e names very rarely la&s;t &s;o many days, which are planted either in <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on</HI>'s, or the <HI>Ordinary of Newgate</HI>'s Mi&s;cellanies.</P>
<P>I have an hundred things to &s;ay to you, which &s;hall be deferr'd till I have the hap|pine&s;s of &s;eeing you in town; for the &s;ea|&s;on now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had communi|cated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain were you pa&s;s'd your time the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on: &s;o much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the plea&s;ure you cou'd de&s;ire from the coun|try,

Therefore hence|forward, to all tho&s;e con&s;iderable qualities I know you po&s;&s;e&s;t of, I &s;hall add that of Prophecy. But I &s;till believe Mr. <HI>Wycher|ley</HI>'s intentions were good, and am &s;atisfy'd that he promi&s;es nothing but with a real de&s;ign to perform it: how much &s;oever his other excellent qualities are above my imi|tation, his &s;incerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmo&s;t that I am,</P>

<P>I Had &s;ent you the inclos'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a Tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Statius,</HI> done when the Author was but 14 Years old, as appears by an Ad|verti&s;ement before the fir&s;t Edition of it in a Mi&s;cellany pub|li&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d by <HI>B.

without &s;u&s;picion of their mi&s;carrying; not that they are of the lea&s;t value, but for fear &s;omebody might be fooli&s;h enough to imagine them &s;o, and inqui&s;itive enough to di&s;cover tho&s;e faults which I (by your help) wou'd correct. I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber, and to be very free of your re|marks in the margins, not only in regard to the accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran|&s;lation; which I have not had time of late to compare with its original. And I de&s;ire you to be the more &s;evere, as it is much more criminal for me to make another &s;peak non&s;en&s;e, than to do it in my own proper per&s;on. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire ver&s;ion of the fir&s;t book. There is an omi&s;&s;ion from the 168th line&mdash;<HI>Jam murmura &s;erpunt plebis ageno|reae</HI>&mdash;to the 312th&mdash;<HI>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>&mdash;(between the&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e he &s;ince tran&s;lated, and they are extant in the printed Ver&s;ion.</NOTE> two <HI>Statius</HI> has a de&s;cription of the council of the Gods, and a &s;peech of <HI>Ju|piter;</HI> which contain a peculiar beauty and maje&s;ty, and were left out for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the con&s;equence

of this machine appears not till the &s;econd book.) The tran&s;lation goes on from thence to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam,</HI> where there is an odd account of a battle at fifty-cuffs be|tween the two Princes on a very &s;light occa&s;ion, and at a time when one wou'd think the fatigue of their Journey in &s;o tem|pe&s;tuous a night, might have render'd them very unfit for &s;uch a &s;cuffle. This I had actually tran&s;lated, but was very ill &s;atis|fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of con&s;cience; it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words&mdash;<HI>Hic primum lu&s;trare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;to the end of the book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt not, that <HI>Sta|tius</HI> was none of the di&s;creete&s;t Poets, tho' he was the be&s;t ver&s;ifier next <HI>Vir|gil:</HI> In the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry, (which <HI>Horace</HI> had already taught the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>) when he asks his Mu&s;e, where to begin his <HI>Thebaid,</HI> and &s;eems to doubt whe|ther it &s;hould not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo?</HI> When he comes to the &s;cene of his Poem, and the prize in di&s;pute between the Brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it&mdash;

I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dre&s;s, that &s;he was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no &s;ooner was her hood remov'd, but I &s;aw one of the fine&s;t faces I ever beheld, and to increa&s;e my &s;urprize, heard her &s;alute me by my name. I never had more rea&s;on to accu&s;e Nature for making me &s;hort-&s;ight|ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever &s;een tho&s;e fair eyes which knew me &s;o well, and was utterly at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s my&s;elf; till with a great deal of &s;implicity and innocence &s;he let me know (even before I di&s;cover'd my ignorance) that &s;he was the daughter of one in our Neigh|bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been con&s;ulting her Phy&s;icians in Town, was re|turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you mu&s;t know, has &s;ometimes recommended the Study of Phy|&s;ick to me, but I never had any ambition
<PB N="254" REF="398">
to be a Doctor till this in&s;tant. I ventur'd to pre&s;cribe &s;ome Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid|den her by her Doctors, &s;he had the more inclination to. In &s;hort, I tempted, and &s;he eat; nor was I more like the Devil than &s;he like <HI>Eve.</HI> Having the good &s;ucce&s;s of the 'fore&s;aid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in &s;pite of my evil Form acco&s;ted her with all the Gaiety I was ma&s;ter of; which had &s;o good effect, that in le&s;s than an hour &s;he grew plea&s;ant, her colour return'd, and &s;he was pleas'd to &s;ay my pre&s;cription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the plea&s;ante&s;t journey imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has &s;ome|thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol|lows as the greate&s;t of truths, That I think my&s;elf extremely oblig'd by you in all points, e&s;pecially for your kind and ho|nourable Information and Advice in a mat|ter of the utmo&s;t concern to me, which I &s;hall ever acknowledge as the highe&s;t proof at once of your friend&s;hip, ju&s;tice, and &s;in|cerity.

And I may derive this plea&s;ure at lea&s;t from it, that whereas I mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been a little unea&s;y to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations; I may now, by bearing his Frailty, exerci&s;e my Grati|tude and Friend&s;hip more than Him&s;elf either is, or perhaps ever will be &s;en&s;ible of.<Q><L>Ille meos, primus qui me &s;ibi junxit, Amores</L>

<P>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your Good-nature, the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet, which is one ble&s;&s;ing Good-nature &s;hou'd indi&s;pen&s;ably receive from mankind, in re|turn for tho&s;e many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in &s;peaking well of me in my ab&s;ence; the only thing by which
<PB N="258" REF="402">
you prove your&s;elf no Wit or Critic: Tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will &s;how ju&s;t as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am ab&s;ent, as he does &s;everity to 'em when I am pre&s;ent. To be very frank with you, Sir, I mu&s;t own, that where I receiv'd &s;o much Civility at fir&s;t, I cou'd hardly have expected &s;o much Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wi&s;h, that the la&s;t were but equal to the fir&s;t, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, &s;o you wou'd omit nothing to improve me.</P>
<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en|quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your &s;peculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-hou&s;e, and bidding adieu for &s;ome time to all the <HI>Rehear&s;als, Reviews, Ga|zettes,</HI> &amp;c. have march'd off into <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire.</HI> Thus I find you vary your life in the &s;cene at lea&s;t, tho' not in the Action; for tho' life for the mo&s;t part, like an old Play, be &s;till the &s;ame, yet no w and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining. As for my&s;elf, I would not have my life a very regular Play, let it be a good mery Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other &s;ide) I wou'd as &s;oon write like <HI>Durfey,</HI> as live like <HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e;</HI> who&s;e bea&s;tly, yet
<PB N="259" REF="403">
merry life, is (if you will excu&s;e &s;uch a &s;i|militude) not unlike a F--t, at once na&s;ty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of the&s;e: every Actor is much better known by his having the &s;ame Face, than by keeping the &s;ame Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was ye&s;terday <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> is to day Sir <HI>John Daw.</HI> So that one might ask the &s;ame que&s;tion of a mo|dern life, that <HI>Rich</HI> did of a modern play; <Q><L>" Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me;</L><L>" Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?</L></Q></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be|cau&s;e I per&s;uade my&s;elf it might be u&s;eful, at a time when we have no other Theatre, to divert our&s;elves at this great one. Here is a glorious &s;tanding Comedy of Fools, at which every man is heartily merry, and thinks him&s;elf an unconcern'd Spectator. This (to our &s;ingular comfort) neither my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen her&s;elf can ever &s;hut up, or &s;ilence. While that of <HI>Drury</HI> (alas!) lies de&s;olate, in the pro|founde&s;t peace: and the melancholy pro|&s;pect of the Nymphys yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no le&s;s moving than that of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Dames lamenting over their ruin'd <HI>Ilium!</HI> What now can they

Of this you may expect a copy as &s;oon as it &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congre&s;s, it is here reported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of

<P>I MAY truly &s;ay I am more oblig'd to you this &s;ummer than to any of my Acquaintance, for had it not been for the two kind letters you &s;ent me, I had been perfectly, <HI>oblitu&s;que meorum, oblivi&s;cendus &amp; illis.</HI> The only companions I had were tho&s;e Mu&s;es of whom <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Adole|&s;centiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, &s;ecundas res ornant, adver&s;is perfugium ac &s;olatium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobi&s;cum, peregrinantur, ru&s;tican|tur.</HI> Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them; for the Mu&s;es, if you take them as Companions, are ve|ry plea&s;ant and agreeable; but whoever &s;hould be forc'd to live or depend up|on 'em, would find him&s;elf in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which <HI>Cowley</HI> calls the <HI>Companion of Ob&s;curity,</HI> was not want|ing to me, unle&s;s it was interrupted by tho&s;e fears you &s;o ju&s;tly gue&s;s I had for our Friend's welfare. 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an|xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<PB N="262" REF="406">
&s;ilence. However the love of &s;ome things rewards it&s;elf, as of Virtue, and of Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley.</HI> I am &s;urpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and mu&s;t agree with you, that our nation would have lo&s;t in him alone, more wit and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the re&s;t of it. My concern for his friend&s;hip will excu&s;e me, (&s;ince I know you honour him &s;o much, and &s;ince you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my unea&s;ine&s;s to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to in&s;inuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I fear may have had &s;ome effect upon him. If &s;o, he will have a greater puni&s;hment for his credulity than I cou'd wi&s;h him, in that fellow's acquain|tance. The lo&s;s of a faithful creature is &s;omething, tho' of ever &s;o contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for &s;uch a Man as the afore&s;aid, I &s;hou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as con&s;tantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a wor&s;e &s;ubject which my &s;pleen tempts me to, I will give you &s;ome account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, &s;ince <HI>Montaigne</HI> (to whom I am but a Dog
<PB N="263" REF="407">
in compari&s;on) has done the very &s;ame thing of his Cat. <HI>Dic mihi quid melius de&s;idio&s;us agam?</HI> You are to know then, that as 'tis Likene&s;s begets affection, &s;o my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the fine&s;t &s;hap'd. He is not much a Spa|niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb &s;urly &s;ort of kindne&s;s, that rather &s;hows it&s;elf when he thinks me ill|us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by our&s;elves. If it be the chief point of Friend&s;hip to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I &s;it, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witne&s;s our walk a year ago in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park.</HI>&mdash;Hi&s;tories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not in&s;i&s;t upon ma|ny of 'em, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome may be almo&s;t as fabulous as tho&s;e of <HI>Pylades</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> &amp;c. I will only &s;ay for the ho|nour of Dogs, that the two mo&s;t antient and e&s;teemable books &s;acred and prophane extant, (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI>) have &s;hewn a particular regard to the&s;e animals. That of <HI>Toby</HI> is the more remarkable, be|cau&s;e there was no manner of rea&s;on to take notice of the Dog, be&s;ides the great hu|manity
<PB N="264" REF="408">

<P>AFTER I had recover'd from a dan|gerous Illne&s;s which was fir&s;t con|tracted in Town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I troubled you with a letter, and a paper inclos'd, which you had been &s;o obliging as to de&s;ire a &s;ight of when la&s;t I &s;aw you, promi&s;ing me in return &s;ome tran&s;lations of yours from <HI>Ovid.</HI> Since when, I have not had a &s;yllable from your hands, &s;o that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have e&s;ca|ped Death, I have not Oblivion. I &s;hou'd at lea&s;t have expected you to have fini&s;h'd that Elegy upon me, which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when I was &s;ick in <HI>London;</HI> if you will but do &s;o much for me fir&s;t, I will give you leave to forget me afterwards; and for my own part will die at di&s;cretion, and at my lei&s;ure. But I fear I mu&s;t be forc'd like many learn|ed Authors, to write my own Epitaph, if I wou'd be remember'd at all. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Fontaine</HI>'s wou'd fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of Sacrilege, (do you think it is not?) to &s;teal Epitaphs. In my pre&s;ent, living dead condition, nothing wou'd be properer than <HI>Oblitu&s;que meorum, oblivi&s;cendus &amp; illis,</HI> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civilities I receiv'd from your&s;elf,

and &s;ome others. They &s;ay indeed 'tis one quality of generous minds to forget the ob|ligations they have con&s;err'd, and perhaps too it may be &s;o to forget tho&s;e on whom they conferr'd 'em? Then indeed I mu&s;t be forgotten to all intents and purpo&s;es! I am, it mu&s;t be own'd, dead in a natural ca|pacity, according to Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff;</HI> dead in a poetical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity, as a u&s;ele&s;s member of the Common-wealth. But re|flect, dear Sir, what melancholy effects may en&s;ue, if Dead men are not civil to one ano|ther? If he who has nothing to do him|&s;elf, will not comfort and &s;upport another in his Idlene&s;s? If tho&s;e who are to die them&s;elves, will not now and then pay the charity of vi&s;iting a Tomb and a dead friend, and &s;trowing a &s;ew flow'rs over him?

<P>I Give you thanks for the Ver&s;ion you &s;ent me of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeablene&s;s that charms us without correctne&s;s, like a mi&s;tre&s;s who&s;e faults we &s;ee, but love her with them all. You have very judiciou&s;ly alter'd his method in &s;ome places, and I can find nothing which I dare in&s;i&s;t upon as an error: What I have written in the margins being merely Gue&s;&s;es at a little improvement, rather than Criti|ci&s;ms. I a&s;&s;ure you I do not expect you &s;hou'd &s;ub&s;cribe to my private notions but when you &s;hall judge 'em agreeable to rea|&s;on and good &s;en&s;e. What I have done is not as a Critic, but as a Friend; I know too well how many qualities are requi&s;ite to make up the one, and that I want almo&s;t all
<PB N="279" REF="423">
I can reckon up; but I am &s;ure I do not want inclination, nor I hope capacity, to be the other. Nor &s;hall I take it at all ami&s;s, that another di&s;&s;ents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in under&s;tanding, he becomes the more eve|ry day a critic upon him&s;elf, and finds &s;omething or other &s;till to blame in his for|mer notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad to know if you have tran&s;lated the 11th Ele|gy of <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Ad amican navigantem,</HI> the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book 3, which are above all others my particular favou|rites, e&s;pecially the la&s;t of the&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the pa&s;&s;age of which you ask my opinion in the &s;econd <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it is either &s;o plain as to require no &s;olution; or el&s;e (which is very probable) you &s;ee farther into it than I can. <HI>Priam</HI> wou'd &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Achilles</HI> (whom &s;urely you only feign to be your Father, &s;ince your actions are &s;o different from his) did not u&s;e me thus inhuman|ly. He blu&s;h'd at his murder of <HI>Hector</HI> when he &s;aw my &s;orrows for him; and re&s;tor'd his dead body to me to be buried."</Q> To this the an&s;wer of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> &s;eems to be agreeable enough. <Q REND="inline">"Go then to the &s;hades, and tell <HI>Achilles</HI> how I degenerate from him:"</Q> granting the truth of what <HI>Priam</HI> had &s;aid of the difference between them.
<PB N="280" REF="424">
Indeed Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s mentioning here what <HI>Virgil</HI> more judiciou&s;ly pa&s;&s;es in &s;ilence, the circum&s;tance of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s &s;elling <HI>for mony</HI> the body of <HI>Hector,</HI> &s;eems not &s;o proper; it in &s;ome mea&s;ure le&s;s'ning the character of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s genero&s;ity and piety, which is the very point of which <HI>Priam</HI> endeavours in this place to convince his Son, and to re|proach him with the want of. But the truth of this Circum&s;tance is no way to be que|&s;tion'd being expre&s;ly taken from <HI>Homer,</HI> who repre&s;ents <HI>Achilles</HI> weeping for <HI>Priam,</HI> yet receiving the gold, <HI>Iliad</HI> 24: For when he gives the body, he u&s;es the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"O my friend <HI>Patroclus!</HI> forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ran&s;om for it, which I will be&s;tow upon thy funeral."</Q></P>

<P>I Deferr'd an&s;wering your la&s;t, upon the advice I receiv'd that you were leaving the town for &s;ome time, and expected your return with impatience, having then a de|&s;ign of &s;eeing my Friends there, among the fir&s;t of which I have rea&s;on to account your&s;elf.

<P>I am glad to find by your la&s;t letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend, &s;etting down your thoughts as they occur, and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own Trifles, which I a&s;&s;ure you I never valu'd half &s;o much as I do that Sincerity in you which they were the occa|&s;ion of di&s;covering to me; and which while I am happy in, I may be tru&s;ted with that dangerous weapon, Poetry; &s;ince I &s;hall do
<PB N="289" REF="433">
nothing with it but after asking and fol|lowing your advice. I value Sincerity the more, as I find by &s;ad experience, the pra|ctice of it is more dangerous; Writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their Ver&s;es, ev'n tho' them&s;elves pronounce &s;entence up|on them.&mdash;As to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI>'s Pa&s;torals, I take the fir&s;t to be infinitely the be&s;t, and the &s;econd the wor&s;t; the third is for the greate&s;t part a Tran&s;lation from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Daphnis.</HI> I will not fore&s;tal your judgment of the re&s;t, only ob&s;erve in that of the Nightingale the&s;e lines, (&s;peaking of the Mu&s;ician's playing on the harp.)<Q><L>Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Like Winds that gently bru&s;h the plying gra&s;s,</L>

<L>And now, laborious, with a weighty hand,</L>
<L>He &s;inks into the Cords, with &s;olemn pace,</L>
<L>And gives the &s;welling Tones a manly grace,</L></Q></P>
<P>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for Pa&s;toral, e&s;pe|cially being put into the mouth of a Shep|herd, as they are here; in the Poet's own per&s;on they had been (I believe) more pro|per. The&s;e are more after <HI>Virgil</HI>'s manner than that of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> whom yet in the character of Pa&s;toral he rather &s;eems to
<PB N="290" REF="434">
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <HI>Tatler,</HI> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a &s;mall copy of the &s;ame Author publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Tatler</HI> N^o 12. on the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint|ing, and I recommend it to your per|u&s;al.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Garth</HI>'s Poem I have not &s;een, but believe I &s;hall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <HI>Will</HI>'s, who &s;wore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of &s;wear|ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more &s;afely when they commend, than when they blame.</P>
<P>I agree with you in your cen&s;ure of the u&s;e of <HI>Sea-terms</HI> in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil;</HI> not only becau&s;e <HI>Helenus</HI> was no great Pro|phet in tho&s;e matters, but becau&s;e no Terms of Art or Cant-Words &s;uit with the Ma|je&s;ty and dignity of Style which <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry requires.&mdash;<HI>Cui mens divinior atque os magna &s;oniturum.</HI>&mdash;The Tarpawlin Phra&s;e can plea&s;e none but &s;uch <HI>Qui aurem habent Batavam;</HI> they mu&s;t not expect <HI>Au|ribus Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phra&s;es of <HI>Martial</HI> here very dexterou&s;ly.)</P>
<P>Tho' you &s;ay you did not rightly take my Meaning in the ver&s;e I quoted from <HI>Juve|nal,</HI> yet I will not explain it; becau&s;e tho' it &s;eems you are re&s;olv'd to take me for a
<PB N="291" REF="435">
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a Commentator.&mdash;And for another rea&s;on too, becau&s;e I have quite forgot both the Ver&s;e and the Application.</P>
<P>I hope it will be no offence to give my mo&s;t hearty &s;ervice to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> tho' I perceive by his la&s;t to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, &s;ince he there told me he was going in&s;tantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser|vant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I gue&s;s by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, a&s;|&s;ure him I have ever borne all the Re|&s;pect and Kindne&s;s imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has e&s;trang'd him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more &s;afely my friend, &s;ince no invitation of his &s;hall ever more make me &s;o free with him. I cou'd not have thought any man had been &s;o very cautious and &s;u&s;pi|cious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to believe no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not &s;o much of Hone&s;ty. There is but one way I know of conver&s;ing &s;afely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we &s;ay or do, but by &s;aying or doing nothing that de&s;erves to be con|ceal'd, and I can truly boa&s;t this comfort in my affairs with Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI> But I par|don

<P>IT &s;eems that my late mention of <HI>Cra|&s;haw,</HI> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curio&s;ity. I therefore &s;end you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for &s;ome years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of tho&s;e who&s;e works may ju&s;t de&s;erve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at lei&s;ure hours, and more to keep out of idlene&s;s, than to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a reputation: &s;o that nothing regular or ju&s;t can be expected from him. All that regards De&s;ign, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex|actne&s;s, or con&s;ent of parts, (which is the
<PB N="303" REF="447">
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret|ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;omething of a neat ca&s;t of Ver&s;e, (which are properly the dre&s;s, gems, or loo&s;e ornaments of Poetry) may be found in the&s;e ver&s;es. This is indeed the ca&s;e of mo&s;t other Poetical Writers of <HI>Mi&s;cellanies;</HI> nor can it well be otherwi&s;e, &s;ince no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diver&s;ion only. The&s;e Authors &s;hou'd be con&s;ider'd as <HI>Ver&s;ifiers</HI> and <HI>witty Men,</HI> rather than as <HI>Poets;</HI> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expre&s;&s;ion, and the Numbers. The&s;e are only the plea&s;ing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to expre&s;s my&s;elf like a Painter) their <HI>Colouring</HI> entertains the &s;ight, but the <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of the Picture are not to be in|&s;pected too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd him&s;elf upon <HI>Pe|trarch,</HI> or rather upon <HI>Marino.</HI> His thoughts one may ob&s;erve, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often &s;train'd and &s;tiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never &s;o apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and incon&s;iderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than under&s;tood. This ambition of &s;urpri&s;ing a reader, is the true natural cau&s;e of all Fu&s;tian, or Bomba&s;t in
<PB N="304" REF="448">
Poetry. To confirm what I have &s;aid you need but look into his fir&s;t Poem of the <HI>Weeper,</HI> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21&s;t &s;tanza's are as &s;ublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d &s;tanza's of the &s;ame copy, are &s;oft and plea|&s;ing: And if the&s;e la&s;t want any thing, it is an ea&s;ier and more unaffected expre&s;&s;ion. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been &s;pared, being eihter but re|petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the fir&s;t one may gue&s;s at all the re&s;t, to be like this; a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and &s;utiable expre&s;&s;ions, of &s;orc'd and inextri|cable conceits, and of needle&s;s fillers-up to the re&s;t. From all which it is plain, this Author writ fa&s;t, and &s;et down what came uppermo&s;t. A reader may skim off the froth, and u&s;e the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot|tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <HI>own, natural, middle-way,</HI> is be&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of his <HI>Numbers</HI> is a little diffi|cult, they are &s;o various and irregular, and mo&s;tly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Ver&s;e (the be&s;t example of which is his <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI>'s <HI>Duel</HI>) is carele&s;ly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<PB N="305" REF="449">
that had he taken more care, it had been mu&s;ical and plea&s;ing enough, not extreme|ly maje&s;tic, but &s;weet: And the time con|&s;ider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un|correct as he is) none of the wor&s;t Ver&s;ifi|cators.</P>
<P>I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the be&s;t Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphra&s;e on P&s;al. 23. On <HI>Le&s;&s;ius,</HI> Epitaph on Mr. <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> Wi&s;hes to his &s;uppos'd Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

<P>I Re&s;ume my old liberty of throwing out my&s;elf upon paper to you, and ma|king what thoughts float uppermo&s;t in my head, the &s;ubject of a letter.

<P><PB N="306" REF="450">
As the fooling and toying with a mi&s;tre&s;s is a proof of fondne&s;s, not di&s;re&s;pect, &s;o is raillery with a friend. I know there are Prudes in friend&s;hip, who expect di&s;tance, awe and adoration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol|wor&s;hipper, tho' a Papi&s;t. If I were to addre&s;s <HI>Jupiter</HI> him&s;elf in a heathen way, I fancy I &s;hou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like <HI>Diony&s;ius;</HI> I was ju&s;t going to &s;ay of his buttons, but I think <HI>Jupiter</HI> wore none (however I won't be po&s;itive to &s;o nice a Critic as you, but his robe might be <HI>Subnected</HI> with a <HI>Fibula.</HI>) I know &s;ome Philo&s;ophers define Laughter, <HI>A recommend|ing our&s;elves to our own favour, by compa|ri&s;on with the weakne&s;s of another:</HI> but I am &s;ure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe <HI>Children</HI> have any &s;uch con&s;ideration in their heads, when they ex|pre&s;s their plea&s;ure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the mo&s;t part, and as &s;illily. There is a difference too betwixt laughing <HI>about</HI> a thing and laugh|ing <HI>at</HI> a thing: One may find the inferior Man (to make a kind of ca&s;ui&s;tical di|&s;tinction) provok'd to folly at the &s;ight or ob&s;ervation of &s;ome <HI>circum&s;tance of a thing,</HI> when the <HI>thing it&s;elf</HI> appears &s;olemn and augu&s;t to the &s;uperior Man, that is, our
