<HEAD>THE
CHARACTER
OF
<HI>KATHARINE,</HI>
LATE
Duche&s; of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_SHE was the Daughter of <HI>James</HI> the
Second, and of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Dor|che&s;ter,</HI>
who inherited the Integrity and
Virtue of her Father with happier For|tune.
She was married fir&s;t to <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>An|gle&s;ey,</HI>
and &s;econdly to <HI>John Sheffield</HI> Duke of
<HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Normanby</HI>; with the former
She exerci&s;ed the Virtues of <HI>Patience and Suffering,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
as long as there was any Hopes of doing Good by
either; with the latter all other <HI>Conjugal Virtues.</HI>
The Man of fine&s;t Sen&s;e and &s;harpe&s;t Di&s;cernment,
She had the Happine&s;s to plea&s;e; and in that, found
her only Plea&s;ure. When he died, it &s;eem'd as
if his Spirit was only breathed into her, to fulfill
what he had begun, to perform what he had con|certed,
and to pre&s;erve and watch over what he had
left, <HI>his only Son</HI>; in the Care of who&s;e Health,
the forming of who&s;e Mind, and the Improvement
of who&s;e Fortune, She acted with the Conduct and
Sen&s;e of the <HI>Father,</HI> &s;often'd, but not overcome
with the Tenderne&s;s of the <HI>Mother.</HI> Her Under|&s;tanding
was &s;uch as mu&s;t have made a Figure,
had it been in a Man; but the Mode&s;ty of her Sex
threw a Veil over its Lu&s;tre, which neverthele&s;s
&s;uppre&s;s'd only the Expre&s;&s;ion, not the Exertion of
it; for her Sen&s;e was not &s;uperior to her Re&s;olution,
which, when once She was in the Right, pre&s;erv'd
her from making it only a Tran&s;ition to the Wrong,
the frequent Weakne&s;s even of the be&s;t Women.
She often followed wi&s;e Coun&s;el, but &s;ometimes went
before it, always with Succe&s;s. She was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of a Spirit, which a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to get the better
of tho&s;e Accidents which admitted of any Redre&s;s,
and enabled her to &s;upport outwardly with Decency
<PB N="5" REF="4">
and Dignity tho&s;e which admitted of none; yet melt|ed
inwardly through almo&s;t her whole Life, at a
Succe&s;&s;ion of melancholy and affecting Objects, the
Lo&s;s of all her Children, the Misfortunes of <HI>Re|lations
and Friends, publick and private,</HI> and the
Death of tho&s;e who were deare&s;t to her. Her
Heart was as compa&s;&s;ionate as it was great: Her
Affections warm even to Sollicitude: Her Friend|&s;hip
not violent or jealous, but rational and per|&s;evering:
Her Gratitude equal and con&s;tant to the
Living; to the Dead boundle&s;s and heroical. What
Per&s;on &s;oever She found worthy of her E&s;teem,
She wou'd not give up for any Power on Earth;
and the greate&s;t on Earth whom She cou'd not
E&s;teem, obtain'd from her no farther Tribute than
Decency. Her Good-Will was wholly directed by
Merit, not by Accident; not mea&s;ured by the Re|gard
they profe&s;s'd for her own De&s;ert, but by her
Idea of theirs: And as there was no Merit which
She was not able to imitate, there was none which
She cou'd envy; therefore her Conver&s;ation was
as free from Detraction, as her Opinions from Pre|judice
or Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. As her Thoughts were her
own, &s;o were her Words; and She was as &s;incere
in uttering her Judgment, as impartial in forming
it. She was a &s;afe Companion, many were &s;erv'd,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
none ever &s;uffer'd by her Acquaintance: Inoffen&s;ive,
when unprovok'd; when provok'd, not &s;tupid: But
the Moment her Enemy cea&s;ed to be hurtful, She
could cea&s;e to act as an Enemy. She was therefore
not a bitter but con&s;i&s;tent Enemy: (tho' indeed,
when forced to be &s;o, the more a fini&s;h'd One
for having been long a making.) And her Pro|ceeding
with ill People was more in a calm and
&s;teady Cour&s;e, like Ju&s;tice, than in quick and pa&s;&s;i|onate
On&s;ets, like Revenge. As for tho&s;e of whom She
only thought ill, She con&s;idered them not &s;o much as
once to wi&s;h them ill; of &s;uch, her Contempt was
great enough to put a Stop to all other Pa&s;&s;ions that
could hurt them. Her Love and Aver&s;ion, her
Gratitude and Re&s;entment, her E&s;teem and Neglect
were equally open and &s;trong, and alterable only
from the Alteration of the Per&s;ons who created them.
Her Mind was too noble to be in&s;incere, and her Heart
too hone&s;t to &s;tand in Need of it; &s;o that She never
found Cau&s;e to repent her Conduct either to a Friend
or an Enemy. There remains only to &s;peak of her
Per&s;on, which was mo&s;t amiably Maje&s;tick, the
nice&s;t Eye could find no Fault in the Outward Li|neaments
of her Face or Proportion of her Body;
it was &s;uch, as pleas'd wherever &s;he had a De&s;ire
it &s;hou'd; yet &s;he never envy'd that of any other,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
which might better plea&s;e in general: In the &s;ame
Manner, as being content that her Merits were
e&s;teemed where She de&s;ired they &s;hould, She never
depreciated tho&s;e of any other that were e&s;teemed or
prefered el&s;ewhere. For She aimed not at a general
Love or a general E&s;teem where She was not known;
it was enough to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of both wherever &s;he was.
Having lived to the Age of Sixty-two Years; not
courting Regard, but receiving it from all who knew
her; not loving Bu&s;ine&s;s, but di&s;charging it fully
where&s;oever Duty or Friend&s;hip engaged her in it;
not following Greatne&s;s, but not declining to pay
Re&s;pect, as far as was due from Independency and
Di&s;intere&s;t; having honourably ab&s;olv'd all the Parts
of Life; She for&s;ook this World, where She had
left no Act of Duty or Virtue undone, for that
where alone &s;uch Acts are rewarded, on the 13th
Day of <HI>March</HI> 1742-3.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The above Character was written by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ome Years before Her Grace's Death.</NOTE></P>
