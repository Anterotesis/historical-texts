<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_A COMMONWEALTH is a
Machine actuated by many
Wheels, one dependant on the
other, yet the Ob&s;truction of
a &s;mall Wheel may &s;top the
Motion of the whole: Every Man ought
therefore as much as in him lies, to con|tribute
in his Station, to the publick Wel|fare,
and not be afraid or a&s;hamed of
doing, or at lea&s;t, meaning well.</P>
<P>I hope therefore the Reader will excu&s;e
the Vanity of an over officious <HI>Old Man,</HI>
if like <HI>Cato,</HI> I enquire whether or no be|fore
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
I go hence and be no more, I can yet
do any thing for the Service of my Country.</P>
<P>For if every Man &s;hould &s;ay Children
are burthen&s;ome, and the Cau&s;e of many
Sorrows, therefore will not I be a Father,
farewel to all Ties of Nature, and
every Ble&s;&s;ing of human Society.</P>
<P>Or if every Man &s;hould &s;ay to him&s;elf,
what have I to do with State Affairs?
is it my Bu&s;ine&s;s? are there not enough
at the Helm? what need I interfere? Let
me be &s;ubject to the Higher Powers, and
let Matters &s;ink or &s;wim, I &s;hall have
Neighbours Fare.</P>
<P>Would not this be a very churli&s;h Re&s;o|lution?
would it not very much contri|bute
to univer&s;al Anarchy and Confu&s;ion?
&s;hould every Man thus throw the Care of
the Publick from his &s;houlders, and acquit
him&s;elf of any Concern for the re&s;t of
Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">
This would be my Ca&s;e, &s;hould I, know|ing
I am Ma&s;ter of a Project, which in
all probability, may be of great u&s;e to
Mankind, rea&s;on thus to my &s;elf; what
have I to do to divulge my Secrets?
What though they are of Benefit to the
Publick, &s;hall I reap any Advantage by
them? Shall I not rather be laugh'd at and
de&s;pi&s;ed as a Projector, the mo&s;t contemp|tible
Character in this Part of the World?
May not another run away with the Profits
of my Labour, and by a little Improve|ment
make my Project his own? is it not
better for me to repo&s;e my&s;elf, to die in
Peace, and leave an ungrateful World to
their own Imaginations? <HI>Non nobis nati
&s;umus.</HI> That Thought would qua&s;h all har&s;h
Contemplations, I could hazard with
Plea&s;ure, the publick Contumely for the
publick Good, knowing it has been the Fate
of much better Men than my &s;elf, to be
de&s;pi&s;ed when living, tho' rever'd when
dead.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">
Prompted by this Reflection, I once more
take Pen in Hand, as I hope for the Ser|vice
of my Country: If my Countrymen
find what I advance practicable, I hope
they will not call my Integrity in que&s;tion.
and if they have patience to read my well
intended Thoughts, tho' dige&s;ted I fear but
too mildly, and in too mean a Stile, I hope
they will find I have advanc'd nothing
but what is practicable, beneficial, and
without Self-Intere&s;t; having excluded my|&s;elf
from any propriety in my own Pro|ject,
by thus publi&s;hing it and making it
every Body's: and if any think I write
for Money, let them ask my Book&s;eller.</P>
<P>Alas I have but &s;mall Health and
little Lei&s;ure to turn Author, being now
in my 67<HI>th</HI> Year, almo&s;t worn out with
Age and Sickne&s;s. The <HI>Old Man</HI> cannot
trouble you long; take then in good part
his be&s;t Intentions, and impute his De|fects
to Age and Weakne&s;s: Look on
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
him as a Man of more Experience than
Learning; excu&s;e his Stile for the &s;ake of
his Subject, and take the Will for the
Deed. A&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, gentle Reader,
I had not publi&s;hed my Project in this Pam|phlet,
could I have got it in&s;erted in any
of the Journals, without Feeing the Jour|nali&s;ts
or Publi&s;hers.</P>
<P>I cannot but have the Vanity to think,
they might as well have in&s;erted what
I &s;ent them, <HI>Gratis,</HI> as many Things I
have &s;ince &s;een in their Papers. But I
have not only had the Mortification to
find what I &s;ent rejected, but to lo&s;e my
Originals, not having taken Copies of what
I wrote.</P>
<P>However, to ju&s;tify my Complaints to
the World, I &s;hall, in a proper Place, let
them know the Sub&s;tance of what was
rejected, and by whom.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="9">
In the mean time, give me leave to a&s;|&s;ure
my Readers, that the Rea&s;on why
this Project appears in a Pamphlet is, be|cau&s;e
I have been thus baffled and di&s;|heartened
by Journali&s;ts; for if by any
Means the Publick could have had it at a
cheaper Rate, I had been better plea&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Prote&s;tant Mona&s;tery.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is nothing on Earth
more &s;hocking, and withal more
common, in but too many Fami|lies,
than to &s;ee Age and Grey
Hairs derided, and ill u&s;ed. The OLD
MAN or the OLD WOMAN, can do
nothing to plea&s;e; their Words are per|verted,
their Actions mi&s;repre&s;ented, and
them&s;elves look'd upon as a Burthen to
their I&s;&s;ue, and a Rent Charge upon tho&s;e
who came from their Loins.</P>
<P>This Treatment, as it is directly oppo|&s;ite
to the Dignity and Decency of Human
Nature, calls aloud for Redre&s;s; the Help|le&s;s
and innocent ought to be the care
of the Healthy and able. Shall a Man or
Woman toil and moil to bring up a nu|merous
I&s;&s;ue? &s;hall they rear up, thro' all
the Uncertainties and Fatigues of Child|hood,
a Race who &s;hall &s;pring up but to
<PB N="2" REF="11">
abandon them? &s;hall they enfeeble them|&s;elves
to give Strength to tho&s;e who &s;hall
one Day thru&s;t them a&s;ide, and de&s;pi&s;e them?</P>
<P>Yet this is the Ca&s;e of many aged Per|&s;ons,
who have outlived the Comforts of
this World; who &s;urvive only to hear them|&s;elves
wi&s;h'd out of the way, by tho&s;e
very Per&s;ons upon whom they have be|&s;towed
their whole Sub&s;tance, and upon
whom their whole Hopes have been fixed.
Uncertain Hopes indeed! and far unfit for &s;o
degenerate an Age. <HI>Honour thy Father
and thy Mother</HI> is a Commandment given
by God, and ratified by our Ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our,
both in Precept and Example; If &s;o,
what Brutes are tho&s;e who &s;hall dare to
&s;purn tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom God has thought
fit to make the Means of their Entrance
into human Life?</P>
<P>But indeed, not only Parents, but all a|ged
People in general, are thought to &s;tand
in the way of the pre&s;ent Generation: and
but for &s;ome good Children, &s;ome Per&s;ons
of Tenderne&s;s and Humanity, who honour
the hoary Head, and comfort the Feeble;
immediate Vengeance would be pulled
down on tho&s;e who let not their Sires
live out half their Days.</P>
<P>The Word OLD is a &s;tanding Je&s;t a|mong
our youthful Gentry. When they
would frighten Children, they tell them
<PB N="3" REF="12">
<HI>The old Man's a coming:</HI> Thus they in|culcate
an Abhorrence of Age, even in
&s;ucking Babes; which no doubt will im|prove
with adult Age, according to the Proverb;
<Q><L>Quo &s;emel e&s;t imbuta recens, &s;ervabit odorem</L><L>Te&s;ta diu.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF any whim&s;ical or ridiculous Story is
told, 'tis of an <HI>Old Woman.</HI> If any Per|&s;on
is aukward at his Bu&s;ine&s;s, or any
thing el&s;e, he is called an <HI>Old Woman,</HI>
for&s;ooth; But this is no new thing, for
we read in former Ages, that they made
Witches of their Old Women. Tho&s;e
were brave Days for young People, when
they could &s;wear the old Ones out of
their Lives! and get a Woman hanged or
burnt only for being a little too old; as
has been the Ca&s;e of many a poor inno|cent
ancient Creature. The Story of the
Witch, <HI>alias,</HI> the poor Old Woman of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> is yet fre&s;h in every one's Me|mory;
and had not the very Judges on the
Bench &s;een through the Enthu&s;ia&s;m and
Ob&s;tinacy of the Evidence, who &s;wore tho|rough
thick and thin: had not the Judges
them&s;elves, I &s;ay, repre&s;ented the thing in a
right Light to the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> poor
<PB N="4" REF="13">
<HI>Jane Wenman</HI> had certainly been tru&s;s'd up;
as a Warning to all ancient Perfons, who
&s;hould dare to live longer than the young
Ones think convenient.</P>
<P>It is well it has never been in the young
Ones Power, to bring in a Bill for the bet|ter
trimming of Mankind, <HI>i. e.</HI> to knock
all ancient People on the Head.</P>
<P>But though they are &s;uffered to live, 'tis
under many Hard&s;hips and Re&s;trictions,
many Humps and Grumps; and &s;carce a
Day, but they are ask'd, what they do out
of their Graves. This is a very common,
but withal, a mo&s;t impious and unchri&s;tian
Saying; nay, not only unchri&s;tian, but even
unmahometan: For the very Infidels them|&s;elves
pay more Veneration to old Age,
than the Chri&s;tians do; to the Shame and
Scandal of our Holy Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, to tax all Chri&s;tians,
or all Children with &s;o &s;evere a Reproach.
No, I only blame tho&s;e who triumph
in the Strength of their Youth, and
&s;nuff up their No&s;trils at <HI>Old-Age:</HI> Who
laugh at the Groanings of the hoary Head,
and have no Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion for the
Bowels that gave them Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch &s;elf-&s;ufficient Per&s;ons con&s;ider,
that it was once in their Parents Power to
have abandoned them, when they were more
helple&s;s than any other Being to which
<PB N="5" REF="14">
God had given Life. When they mu&s;t
inevitably have peri&s;hed, without great
Care and Tenderne&s;s: and indeed the Di|vine
Wi&s;dom is mo&s;t manife&s;tly &s;een, in mak|ing
Man, the Chief of all his earthly Crea|tures,
to require &s;o delicate a Management,
and &s;o tender a Nouri&s;hment: parental Love
being encreas'd by its Care, as filial Love
ought to be, by a Gratitude for that Care
it can never too much acknowledge or re|pay.</P>
<P>All
Creatures whom God has ordained to
quit their Sires, or indeed tho&s;e whom he
has not endow'd with a rational Soul, to
di&s;tingui&s;h between good and bad, or to
know Duty or Obligation, are ea&s;ily brought
up, and can help them&s;elves better the
Hour they are born, than Man can in a
whole Year, nay in Years. They perform
all the nece&s;&s;ary Functions of Life, and
there is no need of Education. Far other|wi&s;e
is it with Man; he in his Infancy re|quires
a con&s;tant and careful Attendance,
his Members know not their Functions,
and it is a long while before he can feed
him&s;elf, even then his Parents have the Care
for his Food. When the Body is duly
nouri&s;hed, there is yet a further Care to
form the Mind, and cultivate the rational
Soul God had endow'd him with.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15">
Shall &s;uch a Being, po&s;&s;e&s;t of a rational
Soul, to di&s;tingui&s;h between Good and Bad,
between Gratitude and Ingratitude, &s;o far
deba&s;e him&s;elf, or indeed become &s;o
much a Brute, as to for&s;ake his Parent, to
&s;purn him who begot him? or at lea&s;t, by
u&s;ing him ill, to elbow him as it were out
of the World, to give him&s;elf the greater
Scope for Luxury?</P>
<P>Yet how many do we &s;ee of &s;uch? how
many truly compa&s;&s;ionate Hearts daily
bleed, when they &s;ee the Son curbing the Fa|ther,
or the Daughter &s;nubbing the Mother?
It &s;eems as if the Order of Nature were per|verted:
So &s;hocking is it to any Soul who
has the lea&s;t Tincture of Humanity.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I &s;peak by Experience: for but
very lately I went to &s;ee an old School-Fel|low
and Acquaintance of mine, who had
lately married his Daughter, and &s;ettled
him&s;elf in her Family; accordingly he gave
me a general Invitation to come one Day or
other and take a Dinner with him; he had
been a Merchant from his Youth, and al|ways
liv'd in what we call high Life, had
travell'd much, and was Ma&s;ter of the mo&s;t
good Manners I ever met with.</P>
<P>This Gentleman being very weary, and in|deed
almo&s;t incapable of Bu&s;ine&s;s, thought it
be&s;t to leave off Hou&s;e keeping, to marry his
Daughter, and &s;ettle in her Family. Ac|cordingly
<PB N="7" REF="16">
he gave her his All for her
Portion, made her a Fortune of 12000
Pounds, and match'd her to an eminent
Merchant, who us'd the &s;ame Trade with
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>During the Honey-Moon, and till the
Portion was paid, the Old Gentleman liv'd
in Clover; nothing was too hot or too hea|vy
for him. 'Twas <HI>Dear Sir! Dear Father!</HI>
at every Word; the Servants were ordered
to re&s;pect him, and he was in &s;ome Share
Ma&s;ter of the Family; but alas! he found
this but a &s;hort-liv'd Dream, the Servants be|gan
to taunt at him, and he mu&s;t call twen|ty
Times for a thing, before he could have
it. If he gently chid 'em, or rea&s;on'd with
them, they flew to their Mi&s;tre&s;s, and made
twenty Stories about it: &s;o that his Life
was in a manner a Burthen to him.</P>
<P>I went in my Chariot to &s;ee him; and
had not the little Appearance I made, com|manded
fome re&s;pect, I had danc'd Atten|dance,
till they &s;hould find in their Hearts
to call him. However, without much
Ceremony, they directed me up three pair
of Stairs, into a better &s;ort of a Garret;
there might be indeed &s;ome Lodging-Rooms
over Head for the Servants; but I have
&s;een many Servants have much better Ap|partments:
but the Room would not
have &s;o much &s;urpriz'd me, had the Fur|niture
<PB N="8" REF="17">
been any thing tollerable. I dare
&s;wear it was as old as the Hou&s;e, and had
no doubt pa&s;s'd from Tenant to Tenant
half a &s;core Times.</P>
<P>This I thought an odd Re&s;idence for my
Friend, but he &s;eem'd contented; and I
&s;aw no Rea&s;on I had to make him other|wi&s;e.
He amu&s;ed me till Dinner time,
with &s;hewing me his Books, and reading
&s;ome of his Ver&s;es to me, as having a pret|ty
Knack that way: he would have play'd
me a Le&s;&s;on on his Flute, but that he &s;aid
it would di&s;turb his Daughter, who did not
love Mu&s;ick. I &s;aw that all his little Arts
were only to beguile the Time, le&s;t a Whet
before Dinner, which I never mi&s;t at his
Hou&s;e, &s;hould be expected; and which I be|lieve
was now out of his Power to give. At
la&s;t the Bell rang, and he de&s;ired me to walk
down to Dinner, but with an Air that
&s;eem'd chidingly to &s;ay, Ah! why did you
not come &s;ooner, when I had more Autho|rity:
However, with a long Apology to his
Son and Daughter, he introduced me; and
by pleading our long and intimate Acquin|tance,
and the Obligations he was under to
me; he prevail'd on them at la&s;t to bid me
a very ceremonious Welcome. Excu&s;ing
them&s;elves, as indeed they had need, that
they had not made a proper Provi&s;ion; and
pleading their Ignorance of my coming,
<PB N="9" REF="18">
accordingly down we &s;ate to, &s;ome cold
Roa&s;t-Beef, a few Herrings, and a Plate of
Fritters. Every thing was indeed very clean,
and we had Attendance enough, but never
in my Life made I a wor&s;e Dinner. Herrings
are my aver&s;ion, I never eat cold Meat, judge
then what a Belly full I could make of my
&s;hare of the Fritters. I happened by Mi&s;take
to call for a Gla&s;s of Wine, without which
I never dine, when the Gentleman told me
he had none in the Hou&s;e; but if I pleas'd
he would &s;end for &s;ome, recommending at
the &s;ame time &s;ome of his Home-brew'd
Ale, which I in Complai&s;ance could not
but accept in Preference to Wine. They
took me at my Word, and with much ado
I got down half a Gla&s;s of the wor&s;t Po|tion
I ever took in my Life, but had the
Dinner been never &s;o elegant, my indigna|tion
would have &s;poil'd my Stomach; to
hear the Daughter at every turn, take up
her Father in his Di&s;cour&s;e, as if he had
been an Idiot or an underling, with <HI>Oh! fye
Sir,</HI> and <HI>I wonder Father you &s;hould &s;ay &s;o!</HI>
But le&s;t the Readers, by my Recital of the
Lady's Phra&s;es, &s;hould think my Friend
&s;pake ludicrou&s;ly or indecently, I beg
Leave to a&s;&s;ure them the contrary, and that
he is a Man of great Wit and &s;trict Mo|de&s;ty.
Even the Son who was the lea&s;t Severe
upon him, could not refrain contradicting
<PB N="10" REF="19">
him every now and then, meerly for con|tradiction
&s;ake, with, <HI>Pray, Sir, give me
Leave,</HI> and <HI>indeed, Sir, you have forgot your
&s;elf;</HI> this was my whole Entertainment:
For my Part I &s;aid little, but admired not
only at this wondrous Frugality, but the
&s;urprizing Impertinence and Ingratitude of
of the young Couple. However, I was
undeceived at la&s;t, as I hope my Readers
will be when I a&s;&s;ure them, that the Rea|&s;on
why <HI>Sir</HI> and <HI>Madam,</HI> eat &s;o &s;paringly
with us was, becau&s;e they had devour'd in
Hugger Mugger by them&s;elves, a good
hand&s;ome Fowl, and Oy&s;ter Sauce, and di&s;|pens'd
with a Bottle of Wine, though they
could drink none in our Company.</P>
<P>Seeing this penurious Management, and
the Awe my poor Friend was in, I thought
it be&s;t to adjourn to the Tavern to &s;moak a
Pipe, and withal to take a Gla&s;s to warm
my Stomach, which rak'd prodigiou&s;ly. I
had before learn'd that the poor old Soul
had been oblig'd to leave off Smoaking,
becau&s;e for&s;ooth his &s;pitting and &s;pawling
turn'd <HI>Madam</HI>'s Stomach; his &s;moaking
&s;he &s;aid, made the Hou&s;e &s;tink, and damag|ed
the Furniture. He had been from his
Youth a great Smoaker, and this &s;udden
Check, upon a Habit of &s;o long &s;tanding,
had very much impair'd his Health.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20">
Accordingly to the Tavern we went; where
a Pipe and a Bottle gave new Life to my old
Acquaintance; he re&s;um'd his native Gayety;
and eleven of the Clock &s;tole upon us, be|fore
we could think of Parting, and even
then but with great Reluctance; &s;o agreea|bly
did the Time pa&s;s away in recounting
our old Adventures. Indeed our &s;weet was
intermix'd with &s;our, for his poor Heart was
&s;o full, he could not contain him&s;elf from
lodging his Sorrows in the Bo&s;om of his old
Friend. With Tears in his Eyes, he recount|ed
all the Indignities he daily met with, not
only from his own Children, but from the
very Servants. If he &s;pake to them as to Ser|vants,
his Daughter would take him up,
and tell him he domineer'd too much in
her Hou&s;e: If he &s;pake &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, he
was told he had no occa&s;ion to make him|&s;elf
&s;o little; in&s;omuch that he knew not
what Medium to take.</P>
<P>He told me his Daughter had lately a
Chamber-Maid, who was the Daughter of
a decay'd Gentleman, and who having had
a tolerable Education, had imbib'd high
Notions of Virtue; and among&s;t other
things, an Abhorrence of undutifulne&s;s in
Children, or indeed any di&s;re&s;pect in old
Age. This young Woman having learn'd
in what Fa&s;hion my Friend had once liv'd,
could not without Indignation, &s;ee how ill
<PB N="12" REF="21">
he was treated: and being of a good Fami|ly
her &s;elf, &s;corn'd to take Part with the o|ther
Servants, to torment a poor old Man;
but on the contrary, would do him all the
Chri&s;tian Offices &s;he could, would con&s;tant|ly
get him &s;omething warm in a Morning,
and if he was out of Order at any time,
would tend him, and do him a thou&s;and
little Services, for which he in Recompence,
when her Lady was gone a Vi&s;iting, would
read to the Girl a whole Afternoon to|gether,
while &s;he &s;at at Work. And as &s;o
many good Offices mu&s;t con&s;equently en|gage
her to him, e&s;pecially when every Bo|dy
el&s;e had abandon'd him, he, with an
innocent Familiarity, us'd to call her his
<HI>Nanny:</HI> This was taken in great Dudgeon,
and the &s;piteful Servants improv'd it into an
Intrigue, and never left till poor <HI>Nanny</HI>
was turn'd away; and with her all the old
Man's Comfort; for he had no warm Break|fa&s;t
now, if he was Sick, there he might
lie, for no body would help him; and as
for Attendance, they neglected him &s;o
much, he was &s;carce clean, which drew
Tears from my Eyes, as knowing what a
neat old Man he was us'd to be. And but
for di&s;gracing his Children, he wi&s;h'd him|&s;elf
a thou&s;and Times in the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
or &s;ome other Place of publick Charity: I
di&s;&s;uaded him from &s;uch Thoughts, and
<PB N="13" REF="22">
comforted him in the be&s;t Manner I could;
and &s;o we both parted and ended our plea|&s;ant
Evening, with heavy Hearts and wet
Eyes.</P>
<P><HI>About a Week after, by the</HI> Penny-po&s;t<HI>,
I receiv'd the following Letter.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I &s;hall carry to my
Grave the agreeable Rememb|rance
of ourla&s;t Meeting, I believe I
&s;hall &s;uffer to my dying Day for that
Night's Plea&s;ure. Your engaging Com|pany,
and my long Ab&s;tinence from
Wine, made me, I think, drink a little
too much; and tho' not to di&s;gui&s;e my
&s;elf, as you I hope might well perceive,
yet more than my Age and Weakne&s;s
cou'd well bear. My Daughter, who
&s;eldom or never comes Home before
Midnight, took Care to be at Home that
very Night before Nine a-Clock; and
at Ten &s;he &s;ent all the Family to Bed,
and &s;ate up for me her &s;elf, out of mere
Spight and pure Intention to rattle me
off; which &s;he did with a Ven|geance,
crying out &s;hame of &s;uch Hours;
telling me I was drunk: and when I
complain'd of &s;ickne&s;s at my Stomach,
<PB N="14" REF="23">
&s;he &s;aid it was good enough for me.
This you may conclude made me wor&s;e.
I thought I &s;hould have died, and had
not I eas'd my Stomach, I had not &s;ur|viv'd
that Moment. This put her be|yond
all Patience, and in&s;tead of pity|ing
her almo&s;t Dying Father, &s;he called
me (would you believe it!) &s;he called
me <HI>Old Bea&s;t;</HI> and u&s;ed me in &s;uch a Man|ner
as has riv'd my very Heart; Nor is
this all, for ever &s;ince I am become the
Je&s;t of the whole Family: they call
me <HI>Old Fool,</HI> and <HI>drunken old Bea&s;t</HI>
to my Face, and every Vi&s;itor that
comes in, is told what a Sot I am; &s;o
that I keep my Chamber, and dare not
&s;how my Head about the Hou&s;e; but I
thank God, who has heard my Prayers,
that I hourly find my &s;elf weaker and
weaker, and I doubt not but my long wi&s;h|ed
for Di&s;&s;olution is near at hand; for all the
Torments of a lingering Death are Trifles
to the U&s;age I meet with. <HI>Dear Friend,</HI>
let me &s;ee you once more before I dye, hav|ing
&s;ome Manu&s;cripts, and a few other
Trifles to give you in Remembrance of
our old Friend&s;hip; which alas! is all
I can give to the only Friend I have
left on this &s;ide the Grave.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Affectionate Friend.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24">FOR the &s;ake of the young Lady, to
whom God grant a &s;peedy Repentance,
I forbear &s;ub&s;cribing even the initial Let|ters
of her Father's Name; that the World
may not know how good a Man &s;he has
murthered: For her U&s;age was &s;uch, that
before I could find Opportunity to vi&s;it
him according to his De&s;ire, I was pre|vented
by a Ticket, which invited me to
hold up his Pall, which more &s;urpriz'd
than afflicted me, as knowing the mi&s;erable
Life, he lead under his mo&s;t unnatural
Daughter.</P>
<Q>Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?</Q>
<P>The burying was of a Piece with the
re&s;t; and I hope the whole will be a Warn|ing
to all aged Per&s;ons, and teach 'em to re|&s;erve
at lea&s;t wherewithal to maintain them|&s;elves
el&s;ewhere, in Ca&s;e of the like U&s;age
from their Children or Relations.</P>
<P>I hope, at the &s;ame time, it will be a
Looking Gla&s;s to young People, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e guilty of the like Actions. If they
&s;ee any thing ugly in this Lady's Charact|er,
let them not be &s;o over good natured
to their own Per&s;ons, as to think what is
a Crime in her, may be excu&s;able in
them&s;elves: No, the Sin is the &s;ame, let
who will commit it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">
To do as we would be done by, one
would think a &s;ufficient Re&s;traint upon any,
who would give them&s;elves the lea&s;t time to
con&s;ider, that they in all probability may
be Fathers and Mothers; and that though
they are young and healthy now, they may
be old and feeble hereafter. Let them
therefore u&s;e the Old as they could wi&s;h to
be us'd when they are &s;o, and let them
be as tender of their Parents, as they wou'd
have their Po&s;terity tender of them.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, we bring up our
Youth, as it were to de&s;pi&s;e us; and to our
&s;hame be it &s;poken, make Rods for our
&s;elves: Every one indulges his own Chil|dren,
and &s;o all act with Impunity. Our
Youth are not half educated, nor are they
under any Re&s;traint; we make Men and
Women of them too &s;oon, and put 'em up|on
a footing with our &s;elves, before they
have well learned good Manners, or indeed
any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>For good Manners does not altogether
con&s;i&s;t in a formal Courte&s;y or Bow, in
coming in and going out of a Room: No,
a Man may behave him&s;elf mo&s;t punctually
Ceremonious at a Ball, a drawing Room,
a Tea-Table, or indeed in any other fiddle
faddle part of Life; and yet for all this be
but a Man of Clouts, a meer <HI>Sir-courtly-Nice.</HI>
I have very often &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="26">
well dre&s;s'd, well bred Gentlemen, <HI>alias</HI>
Hobbydehoy's have A&s;&s;urance enough to
&s;tare a whole Coffee-Room out of Counte|nance;
but neither Sen&s;e or Learning
&s;ufficient to give any Man of Parts a rea|&s;onable
An&s;wer.</P>
<P>No, the Satchel is too &s;oon taken from
the &s;houlders of our young &s;parks, and the
Rod from their Back&s;ides; the Tye-Wig
and Sword are too &s;oon put on, and lit|tle
Ma&s;ter is made a Man before he
is a well-grown Child; our little Girls,
through the Indulgence of their Mothers,
are yet more forward, and put on woman|ly
Airs even at ten Years of Age. In a
Word, our Youth in general, are above
Correction; without Shame, too ripe, too
ignorant, and too impudent, and according
to the Poet.<Q><L>Now little Mi&s;s in Hanging-Sleeves knows
more</L><L>Than formerly her Grandame at three|&s;core:</L><L>And Ma&s;ter who was lately whipt at School,</L><L>At bare thirteen &s;ets up for Rake and Fool,</L><L>Runs the whole Race of Vice with full
Career,</L><L>Is green and ripe and rotten in a Year.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27">
In&s;tead of Puerile Diver&s;ions, our Boys
of 14 or 15 Years of Age go to Plays, be|come
Members of Clubs, keep Hounds and
Hor&s;es, and &s;ometimes follow wor&s;e Game.
This is owing to the over Indulgence of Pa|rents,
who let them finger Money before
they know the Worth of it; and if a Stop
be not put to &s;uch Practices in this Generati|on,
the next may &s;everely repent it.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Babies, Play-Things, and other
pretty Innocencies u&s;ed of old, our Girls
at 10 or 11 Years of Age, keep their vi&s;it|ing
Days, have their &s;elect Companies,
and treat 'em with as much Solemnity and
Expence, as their Parents do their own Ac|quaintance:
This prevails not only at
Court, but in the City; and I doubt not
but the Court Airs of the Mother, and the
womanly Airs of the Daughter, have made
Bankrupt many an hone&s;t Man, who had
not Courage enough to repel the Force of
this mo&s;t prevailing, mo&s;t pernicious
Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>This idle Cu&s;tom is not only very Expen|&s;ive,
but extreamly inconvenient withal;
for there is as much a Fu&s;s made at &s;ome
Hou&s;es again&s;t &s;uch a Mi&s;s or &s;uch a Mi&s;s
comes to vi&s;it the Daughter, as if a Dutch|e&s;s
was expected. The Servants are hin|dred
from their other Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the
whole Hou&s;e is in a Flu&s;ter to receive
<PB N="19" REF="28">
Mi&s;s's Vi&s;itors for&s;ooth. When the Vi&s;it is
return'd, &s;he mu&s;t be dre&s;s'd up to the heighth
of the Mode, and &s;ome new Thing or other
is always wanted: Not to mention Top-Knots,
Gloves, Coach-hire, and other una|voidable
Expences.</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t criminal in tho&s;e who
cannot afford it; Such People would
therefore do well to reduce their Children
to the Old Standard; that is to &s;ay, make
Scholars of their Boys, and Hou&s;ewives
of their Girls: for the Education above
complain'd of, has &s;poil'd many a good
Trade&s;man's Wife, and been the Ruin of
many a Family.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this Di&s;cour&s;e, without
particularly cautioning the young Ladies
of this Age, how they Laugh, Fleer, and to&s;s
up their No&s;es at &s;ober Matrons, and el|derly
Ladies. Let 'em con&s;ider, that tho&s;e
very Per&s;ons were once young and beau|tiful
as them&s;elves, if not more beautiful:
For to &s;ay truth, Tea, Drams, Wine,
and late Hours, have not a jot added
to the Beauty of the pre&s;ent Gene|ration.</P>
<P>Let
them again con&s;ider, that their
own Mothers as well as them&s;elves, are
of the &s;ame Sex: That it is a foul Bird
bewrays its own Ne&s;t; that the very
Infirmities they deride in tho&s;e Per&s;ons,
<PB N="20" REF="29">
are probably occa&s;ioned by the bearing
and bringing up many Children; and that
the Wrinkles in their Faces are occa&s;ioned
by their Care to &s;upport &s;uch giddy
brain'd Creatures as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the Ignorance and Impu|dence
of the pre&s;ent Generation, that
young People look upon their Elders, as
upon a different Species, an inferiour Cla&s;s
of People: They a&s;cribe no Merit to the
Virtue and Experience of Old Age, but
a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Preference in
all things. With them a Face and a good
Shape is Merit, a &s;cornful to&s;s of the
Head, and de&s;pi&s;ing every Body, but their
own dear &s;elves is Wit, an everla&s;ting
Giddine&s;s, and an eternal Grin is Affabili|ty
and good Nature, fancy in Dre&s;s, is
Under&s;tanding, a &s;upine Neglect of every
thing commendable Gentility; and a pro|digious
Punctilio in the greate&s;t Trifles, is
the Heighth of good Breeding.</P>
<P>From this general Corruption in Edu|cation,
proceeds all that may be com|plain'd
of in this pre&s;ent Age, and what|ever
Evils may be expected in Generations
to come. But above all, nothing has more
contributed to this Corruption, than the
di&s;regard paid to Teachers and other Per|&s;ons
concern'd in the Education of Youth;
for the fir&s;t and chief Step to the Ruin of
<PB N="21" REF="30">
Youth, is when they have no Awe upon
'em, and are above Correction.</P>
<P><HI>Spare the Rod and &s;poil the Child,</HI> is a
Sentence of &s;o much Weight and Truth;
that no &s;harper a Reprimand can be given
to tho&s;e Parents, who have &s;timulated in
their Children a Spirit of Pride, and taught
them to look contemptibly on their Tu|tors.
The very Word <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>
implies &s;omething of Dominion; and as
Youth are committed to their Care, &s;o they
ought to be &s;ubject to their Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>It &s;hocks me when I &s;ee a Tutor in a
great Family, put upon a Footing with the
Servants; it makes his Pupil think con|temptibly
of him, and is too great a Curb
on his Spirits, to let him deliver his
In&s;tructions and Sentiments, in a manner
&s;uitable to the Dignity of an In&s;tructor.
And what is wor&s;e, the little Deference
paid to him, begets in the young Gentle|man
a mean Opinion of and Indifference to
Learning it &s;elf, &s;eeing his Ma&s;ter reap &s;o
little Advantage and Re&s;pect from it.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame Ca&s;e in Schools, where
the Ma&s;ter's or Mi&s;tre&s;s's pa&s;&s;ive and &s;or|did
Temper makes them the Slaves of the
Scholars, whom they dare not correct, for
fear of loo&s;ing: Nothing being more com|mon
now a days, than for Parents to
make it in their Bargain, that their Chil|dren
<PB N="22" REF="31">
&s;hall not be whipt, or otherwi&s;e cor|rected
at School. Hence proceeds all that
Noi&s;e and Mi&s;rule, which reigns in Schools,
&s;tunning both Ma&s;ter and Scholars to
&s;uch a Degree, that they can hardly hear
each other &s;peak.</P>
<P>Parents therefore can blame none but
them&s;elves, if by the&s;e pernicious Me|thods,
their Children grow in time to be
too many for them; nor can they with
any rea&s;on expect to find Duty and Hu|manity,
where they have not been in|culcated.
If they have countenanc'd, or
indulg'd their Children, in deriding the
hoary Head, are they to be pitied when
they reap &s;even Fold the Fruits of &s;o un|generous
a Tillage? or to &s;peak more
plain, when it comes Home to them&s;elves.
Let every Per&s;on therefore make the Ca&s;e
their own, when they &s;ee Children taunt|ing
and flouncing at their Parents, Teach|ers,
or Relations; mocking and deriding
People for Age and Infirmities, or indeed
any other bodily Misfortune, or Deformity;
upbraiding any for their Poverty, or crowing
over any Per&s;on, over whom they may pre|tend
to claim Preheminence. This domi|neering
way being now a days &s;o preva|lent,
that Trade&s;men, Servants and other
Dependants, are generally more in&s;ulted by
Children, than by Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32">
To conclude, as we &s;ow we &s;hall reap;
As we bring up our Children, &s;o we may
expect to find them: If we educate them
in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, in
an univer&s;al Benevolence to all Mankind,
void of all per&s;onal or Party Prejudice;
if we train them up to be dutiful to their
Parents, re&s;pectful to their Teachers, man|nerly
to their Equals, and courteous to their
Inferiours; if we incite in 'em an Emula|tion
and Thir&s;t after Knowledge and other
liberal Acquirements; If we in&s;til into 'em
early Principles of Humanity, Compa&s;&s;ion
and Forbearance; and in a Word, all that
may in&s;pire to the highe&s;t Notions of
Honour, and carry human Nature to its
mo&s;t exalted Pitch; then may we expect
to have Comfort in Old Age, from our
Grand Children, our Children and other
Relations; then may we conclude we
have laid a &s;ure Foundation for the Happi|ne&s;s
of &s;ucceeding Generations.</P>
<P>But if on the contrary, we humour and
favour all their little Petulancies, and by o|ver
prai&s;ing and indulging them, make
our &s;elves contemptible in their Eyes; if
in&s;tead of correcting them in their Errors,
we arraign the Ju&s;tice of Di&s;cipline, and
call it Severity; if we &s;uffer them with
Impunity to fly in the Faces of their Parents
and Relations, to defy their Teachers, to
<PB N="24" REF="33">
outvie their Equals, and in&s;ult their Infe|riours;
If we permit 'em to &s;coff at, and
turn to ridicule the Misfortunes and Afflic|tions
of others, and in a manner, &s;uppre&s;s,
or at lea&s;t, not encourage in them any
Propen&s;ity to Tenderne&s;s, but &s;uffer their
Hearts to be hardned, and to know no
Pity: we mu&s;t expect to have our Eyes
pluck'd out by tho&s;e we have brought up.
We mu&s;t look for nothing in Old Age, but
Contempt, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and all the In&s;ults
we have but too much rea&s;on to fear
from &s;o inhuman a Generation.</P>

<P N="1">_THAT a Joint-Stock of Twen|ty
Thou&s;and Pounds be rai&s;ed
between 50 Per&s;ons, by an
equal Depo&s;ite of four Hun|dred
Pounds each; which Stock
is to be ve&s;ted in them&s;elves only. For
this being no Charity, but rather a Co|partner&s;hip,
there is no need of having any
Governor, Trea&s;urer, Director, or other
commanding Officer, but what may be
cho&s;en among them&s;elves; and as the Mo|ney
<PB N="25" REF="34">
is their own, they are the fitte&s;t Per|&s;ons
to keep it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after they have obtained his

them&s;elves, one Trea&s;urer, two
Wardens, and &s;uch other Officers they &s;hall
deem proper; which Officers &s;hall have
annual Rotation, and new ones be
cho&s;en every year.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in&s;tead of con&s;uming all, or a
great Part of the Stock in Building, which
would nip the Project in the Bud, they
&s;hall rent a convenient Hall or Hou&s;e in
Town or Country, at their own Option;
which Hou&s;e mu&s;t be equally divided into
Apartments: and to &s;ave another great
Expence, as well as to prevent Partiality,
or Di&s;gu&s;t, 'tis fit that every Per&s;on fur|ni&s;h
their own Apartment, which Furni|ture
they may bequeath to whom they
plea&s;e. For as all the Members of the Col|lege
are to be upon an equal Footing,
'tis highly nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould not be the
the lea&s;t Di&s;tinction among them in Diet,
Lodging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if one Per&s;on dre&s;&s;es
or furni&s;hes better than another, there
will be no need of Complaint, becau&s;e
they do it at their own Charge: Tho' to
&s;peak my Mind, it would look mo&s;t love|ly,
<PB N="26" REF="35">
to have a decent Equality and Unifor|mity
in Dre&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Kitchin, the Infirmary, and o|ther
Offices, to be furni&s;hed at the common
Expence, but not to be taken out of the
Joint-Stock. On the contrary, every Per|&s;on
to pay an equal Proportion, which can|not
amount to above two Guineas a Head.
But in Ca&s;e the Joint-Stock encrea&s;es, the
Money to be refunded.</P>
<P N="5">5. That they call a Court among them|&s;elves

all Bargains made, all Accounts audited,
Servants hired or di&s;plac'd, the Diet,
and College Hours &s;ettled; and bye Laws
made or amended as Occa&s;ion, or the

<P N="6">6. As all are to &s;hare the Benefit, it

above all that they will go on a &s;ure
Footing, and content them&s;elves with the

<P>The <HI>Clerk</HI> or <HI>Book-keeper</HI> mu&s;t be con|&s;tantly
in the accompting Hou&s;e, to &s;et
down every Particular, to minute the pro|ceeding
of Committees, to keep the ac|count
of Ca&s;h, and in a word, to take the
<PB N="30" REF="39">
trouble of writing off the <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> and
<HI>Warden</HI>'s Hands; he mu&s;t diet in the
Hou&s;e. As al&s;o,</P>
<P>The <HI>Chaplain,</HI> &s;ome &s;ober elderly de|cay'd
Clergyman of good Morals, to read
Prayers Morning and Evening; and every
Sunday a Sermon out of Bi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI> Dr. <HI>South,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;ound
Divine: And to further this good Work,
I my &s;elf will pre&s;ent the College with
a hand&s;ome Bible, and Common Prayer
Book, and all the Sermons above-men|tioned,
if I live to &s;ee it fini&s;h'd; and
if I dye before, I have made proper Pro|vi&s;ion
in my Will.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cook</HI> mu&s;t dre&s;s the Victuals, keep
clean the Kitchin, Pantry and Cellar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Laundry-Maid</HI> mu&s;t wa&s;h and
mend their Linnen, and wait at Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e-Maid</HI> mu&s;t make the Beds,
&s;weep the Rooms and wait at Table.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Nur&s;es</HI> mu&s;t attend the Infir|mary,
and &s;it up alternately if need be; and
when none are Sick, they mu&s;t help, get
up and mend the Linnen, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the
other Servants, as the Trea&s;urer and Ward|ens
&s;hall appoint.</P>
<P>As the Thing encrea&s;es, &s;o may the Ser|vants
and their Wages. A Porter, a But|ler,
a Scullion, and other Servants may
be added as the Members think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="40">
To crown all, let the whole be in|dependent,
and among them&s;elves; let
them always keep the Staff in their own
Hands, and never &s;ubject them&s;elves to
Trea&s;urers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> out of their own Body.
Let them accept of no Charities, but do as
many as they are able; and in a Word,
let them keep up the Grandeur of the De|&s;ign,
to &s;uch a Pitch, that their Friends and
Relations may not be a&s;hamed to vi&s;it them;
but on the contrary, be proud they are
of &s;uch a Body. Let the Election of new
Members be ve&s;ted only in them&s;elves, and
let them chu&s;e only &s;uch as &s;hall give Repu|tation
to the College.</P>
<P>In a Word, I have drawn up my Scheme
in general Terms, it being intended for
the Benefit of either Sex. 'Tis indifferent
whether the Ladies compo&s;e a College,
and call them&s;elves Si&s;ters, or any other
Name they &s;hall think fit; or whether a
College be compos'd of Gentlemen, under
the Title of Brothers, Fellows, or any other
Denomination; our <HI>PROTESTANT
MONASTERY</HI> is &s;till the &s;ame; nor
can a Name alter its Property, or make
it le&s;s beneficial or commendable.</P>
