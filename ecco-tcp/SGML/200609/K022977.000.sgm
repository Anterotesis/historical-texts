<P>IF we will look a little into the Conduct and Cu&s;tom of the World, it may not appear &s;o extraordinary as &s;ome have thought it, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> becau&s;e he cannot be the <HI>Foun|tain of Honour</HI> to Mankind, &s;hould be fond of u&s;urping the <HI>Fountain of Infamy,</HI> and plea&s;e him&s;elf with dealing out a Fund of <HI>dirty</HI> Pro|motions from that <HI>inexhau&s;tible</HI> Spring.

<P>Some Readers, 'tis probable, would have been glad to know why the Poets call <HI>Cupid</HI> Signior <HI>Junio.</HI> Has it an Allu&s;ion to any old Tale, or to any Charactar in any old Play?

<P>Sagacity with a Vengeance! What?

In &s;hort, i&s; Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> won't merrily call it <HI>pidling,</HI> I will venture to give Light to this very difficult Pa&s;&s;age. The Speech is by a Pedant, who frequently throws in a Word of <HI>Latin</HI> among&s;t his <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and he is here flouri&s;hing upon the Merit of Invention, beyond that of Imitation, or copy|ing after another.

<P>Sagacity again! unle&s;s Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> means an Im|provement of the <HI>Art Military,</HI> by teaching us that it was ever a Cu&s;tom to hew down Ca&s;tles with a Battle-Ax. Or, how if he &s;hould have a Mind to tell us, that they wore <HI>Ca&s;tles,</HI> former|ly, upon their Heads for <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> Armour? There is, indeed a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> which &s;uch a Commentator might take in &s;uch a Sen&s;e.</P>

<P>Writing De&s;truction on the Enemies <HI>Caske?</HI></P>
<P>A broken <HI>k</HI> in the Manu&s;cript might be mi&s;ta|ken for a <HI>tl,</HI> and thus a Ca&s;tle was built at once: But I think it would be &s;omething ea&s;ier to &s;plit an <HI>Helmet</HI> with a Battle-Ax, than cut down a <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> and that is one Rea&s;on which induces me to propo&s;e this Reading.</P>
<P>I had de&s;ign'd to throw in another Emenda|tion upon the Word <HI>Ca&s;tle;</HI> but I have already tran&s;gre&s;s'd the Limits of a Letter, and there are two, or three, Topicks &s;till behind, that I have an Occa&s;ion to touch upon.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s DUNCIAD having lately made its Appearance in &s;o pompous a Shape, with <HI>Notes variorum,</HI> (I am &s;orry the Editor could not &s;pare us this &s;hort Scrap in a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Lan|guage;) I am very well content to pa&s;s over the <HI>Slander</HI> of his <HI>Wit;</HI> but ought not, as I apprehend, to re&s;t Silent under <HI>that</HI> of his <HI>Malice,</HI> in which he would fix a pretended Charge of Ingratitude upon Me, a Vice, I hope, of all others the lea&s;t ingra&s;ted in my Nature. This Charge is, <Q>That during the Space of two Years, while Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was preparing his Edition of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> I, who had then &s;ome Corre&s;pondence with him, and was &s;ol|liciting Favours by Letters, did wholly con|ceal
<PB N="40" REF="42"> my De&s;ign (upon that Author) till after his Publication.</Q></P>
<P>To one Part of this Accu&s;ation I have re|ply'd in a former Letter in this <HI>Paper.</HI> To &s;ay I concealed my De&s;ign, is a &s;light Mi&s;|take: for I had no &s;uch certain De&s;ign, till I &s;aw how <HI>incorrect</HI> an Edition Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had gi|ven the Publick. To the other Part, I think, I dare &s;ecurely charge my Memory with all the <HI>Favours</HI> that ever I ventur'd to ask of Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI> and I challenge him to produce my Let|ters again&s;t me, if he thinks there is any Room for it. The fir&s;t Favour that I ask'd, was, when I introduced a Play upon the Stage, that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in a few Tickets towards my Benefit. In about a Month after this Reque&s;t, I received my Packet back, with this civil Excu&s;e, That he had been all the while from home, and had not my Parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it. This, I confe&s;s, induced me, when I put out my Propo&s;als for <HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> to &s;ollicit Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> for this <HI>Second Favour,</HI> that he would plea&s;e to recommend <HI>that</HI> my <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> if it did not interfere with his own Affair of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> To this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> reply'd by Letter, <Q>That <HI>he was glad I had undertaken this Work, and &s;hould be as glad to promote my Intere&s;t, notwith&s;tanding his own Sub&s;cription to the</HI> Ody&s;&s;ey: <HI>That his own Awkwardne&s;s, and indeed Inability, of &s;olliciting in any Kind, made him quite u&s;e|le&s;s
<PB N="41" REF="43"> to his own Intere&s;t; but that he might not be intirely &s;o to mine, he would ask tho&s;e of his Friends for me, with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing.</HI></Q>&mdash;But from that Day to the Publication of my <HI>Shake|&s;peare Re&s;tored,</HI> (an Interval of above Two Years) I never received one Line more from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> no Intimation of <HI>one</HI> Sub&s;criber by his Intere&s;t, not even an Order that I &s;hould put his <HI>own</HI> Name down in my Li&s;t. Upon this naked Fact, I &s;ubmit the Cen&s;ure both of my <HI>Obligations</HI> and <HI>Ingratitude.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Publick</HI> &s;hould not have been troubled with this State of the Ca&s;e, had not the&s;e In&s;i|nuations been indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated at this Cri&s;is, both to hurt my Intere&s;t in my <HI>Sub&s;crip|tion</HI> for my <HI>Remarks on</HI> SHAKESPEARE, which will now &s;hortly appear in the World; and in that <HI>Play,</HI> which is de&s;igned for my <HI>Benefit</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> next in the Theatre at <HI>Drury Lane.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Double Fal&s;hood.</NOTE> It is my Misfortune, I can boa&s;t but of a very &s;canty Intere&s;t, and much le&s;s Merit; and, con|&s;equently, Both are the more ea&s;ily to be &s;hock|ed.
