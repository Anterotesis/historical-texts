<P>THIS is the Place we were directed to; and now,

become of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And me too, Sir.&mdash;You mu&s;t con&s;ider I am
a marry'd Man, and can't bear Fatigue as I have done.&mdash;But pray, Sir, why did you leave the Army &s;o abruptly,
and not give me Time to fill my Knap&s;ack with common
Nece&s;&s;aries? Half a Dozen Shirts, and your Regimentals,
are my whole Cargo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was wild to get away, and as &s;oon as I obtain'd
my Leave of Ab&s;ence, I thought every Moment an Age
till I return'd to the Place where I fir&s;t &s;aw this young-charming,
innocent, bewitching Creature&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>With fifteen thou&s;and Pounds for her Fortune&mdash;Strong Motives, I mu&s;t confe&s;s.&mdash;And now, Sir, as
you are pleas'd to &s;ay you mu&s;t depend upon my Care and
Abilities in this Affair, I think I have a ju&s;t Right to be
acquainted with the Particulars of your Pa&s;&s;ion, that I may
be the better enabled to &s;erve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall have 'em.&mdash;When I left the Uni|ver&s;ity,
which is now &s;even Months &s;ince, my Father, who
loves his Money better than his Son, and would not &s;ettle
a Farthing upon me&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine did &s;o by me, Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Purchas'd me a Pair of Colours at my own Re|que&s;t;
but before I join'd the Regiment, which was going
<PB N="2" REF="5">
abroad, I took a Ramble into the Country with a Fellow-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">legian,
to &s;ee a Relation of his who liv'd in <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI>&mdash;</P>

<P>&mdash;A Party of Plea&s;ure, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>During a &s;hort Stay there, I came acquainted with
this young Creature; &s;he was ju&s;t come from the Boarding-School,
and tho' &s;he had all the Simplicity of her Age and
the Country, yet it was mix'd with &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Vivacity,
that I took Fire at once&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was Tinder my&s;elf at your Age. But pray, Sir,
did you take Fire before you knew of her Fortune?</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before, upon my Honour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Folly and Con&s;titution&mdash;But on, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was introduced to the Family by the Name of
<HI>Rhodophil,</HI> (for &s;o my Companion and I had &s;ettled it;) at
the End of three Weeks I was oblig'd to attend the Call of
Honour in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Parting, to be &s;ure, was Heart-breaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel it at this In&s;tant.&mdash;We vow'd eternal Con|&s;tancy,
and I promis'd to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of re|turning
to her: I did &s;o, but we found the Hou&s;e &s;hut up,
and all the Information, you know, that we could get from
the neighbouring Cottage was, that Mi&s;s and her Aunt were
remov'd to Town, and liv'd &s;omewhere near this Part of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now we are got to the Place of Action, pro|po&s;e
your Plan of Operation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father lives but in the next Street, &s;o I mu&s;t
decamp immediately for fear of Di&s;coveries; you are not
known to be my Servant, &s;o make what Enquiries you can
in the Neighbourhood, and I &s;hall wait at the Inn for your
Intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll patrol hercabouts, and examine all that pa&s;s;

<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Honour plea&s;es to con&s;ider that I had a
Wife in Town whom I left &s;omewhat abruptly half a Year
ago, you'll think it, I believe, but decent, to make &s;ome
Enquiry after her fir&s;t; to be &s;ure it would be &s;ome &s;mall
Con&s;olation to me to know whether the poor Woman is li|ving,
or has made away with her&s;elf, or&mdash;</P>

<SP>

<P>Pr'ythec don't di&s;tract me; a Moment's Delay is

<P>The Devil's in the&s;e fiery young Fellows! they
think of no body's Wants but their own. He does not
con&s;ider that I am Fle&s;h and Blood as well as him&s;elf. How|ever
I may kill two Birds at once; for I &s;han't be &s;urpriz'd
if I meet my Lady walking the Streets&mdash;But who have

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja&s;per.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Bu&s;ine&s;s has been very brisk during the

<P>Piping hot, I a&s;&s;ure you; Fire and Smoke will tar|ni&s;h;

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja&s;per.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't ab&s;olutely live, but I am mo&s;t of my

<P>Not ab&s;olutely; the Girl, I believe, dete&s;ts

end I can't tell&mdash;but I am hot upon't my&s;elf.</P>

a threatning <HI>Po&s;ter,</HI>&mdash;thus;&mdash;he makes a Cut at
me with his Whip, and &s;triking me over the Nail of my
