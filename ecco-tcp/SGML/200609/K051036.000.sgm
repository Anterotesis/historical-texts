<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS being probably the la&s;t Time I may tre&s;pa&s;s on the Publick, I look up|on my&s;elf in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure obliged to &s;ettle my Accounts with the World as an Au|thor, before I make my <HI>Exit,</HI> by en|deavouring to &s;hew I have not always offended out of Pre&s;umption, Vanity, or Wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">The fir&s;t Time I adventured in Print, was on the Account of my great Ma|&s;ter and generous Friend, Dr. <HI>Pit|cairn.</HI> He thought him&s;elf ill-u&s;ed by &s;ome of his Brethren of the profe&s;&s;ion who then were at inte&s;tine War on the Subject of Fevers; and fancied the hand&s;ome&s;t Way to bring them down, was to exhibit a more &s;pecious Account of this Di&s;ea&s;e, than any of them had &s;hewn. His Bu&s;ine&s;s then in the Pra|ctice of Phy&s;ick was &s;o great, as not to allow him &s;ufficient Time for &s;uch a Work. Two others therefore, with my&s;elf, were joined to manage the Af|fair: In which he was to cut and carve, and to add the practical Part. My Province was the Theory. I was then very young in the Profe&s;&s;ion, and living in the Country. But in a few Days I brought in my Part fini&s;hed, as it now appears, under the Title of
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
<HI>The New Theory of Fevers.</HI> The others either &s;uppre&s;s'd or forgot theirs, and mine, without the lea&s;t Alteration, but in a few Words, was ordered for the Pre&s;s. I could not re&s;ist the Com|mands of my Friend; but would not &s;uffer my Name to be put to it, being con&s;cious it was a raw and unexpe|rienced Performance. There are tho', &s;ome Thing sin it which may be of U&s;e to Beginners, both as to the Method of philo&s;ophi&s;ing on the animal Oecono|my, and in the Account of the Man|ner of the Operation of the greater Me|dicines. The Foundations al&s;o and the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for acute and &s;low Fe|vers, I &s;till think &s;olid and ju&s;t, and more particular and limited than tho&s;e of any other Theory yet publi&s;hed. But it wants &s;o much filing and fini&s;hing, &s;o many Alterations and Additions, as would co&s;t me more Labour and Pains than the writing a new Treati&s;e on the
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
&s;ame Subject: So that out of mere La|zine&s;s and Inappetency, I have thrown it by as unripe Fruit, and &s;uffered it to be as if it never had been.</P>
<P>My next Sally was in a Book of ab&s;tracted Geometry and Algebra, en|titled, <HI>Methodus Fluxionum Inver|&s;a,</HI> brought forth in Ambition and bred up in Vanity. There are &s;ome Things in it tolerable for the Time, when the Methods of Quadratures, the Men&s;u|ration of Ratio's, and Transformation of Curves, into tho&s;e of other Kinds, were not advanced to &s;uch Heights as they now are. But it is a long Time &s;ince I was forced to forgoe the&s;e barren and airy Studies for more &s;ub&s;tantial and commodious Speculations: Indulging and Rioting in the&s;e &s;o exqui&s;itely bewitch|ing Contemplations, being only proper for publick Profe&s;&s;ors, and tho&s;e born to E&s;tates, and who are under no out|ward
<PB N="v" REF="7">
Nece&s;&s;ities. Be&s;ides, to own a great but grievous Truth, tho' they may quicken and &s;harpen the Invention, &s;treng|then and extend the Imagination, im|prove and refine the rea&s;oning Faculty, and are of U&s;e both in the nece&s;&s;ary and the luxurious Refinement of me|chanical Arts; yet having no Tendency to rectify the Will, &s;weeten the Tem|per, or mend the Heart, they often leave a Stiffne&s;s, Po&s;itivene&s;s, and Suf|ficiency on weak Minds, much more pernicious to Society, and the Intere&s;ts of the great End of our Being, than all the Advantages they bring them can recompence. They are indeed Edge-Tools, not to be tru&s;ted in the Hands of any, but tho&s;e who have already acquired an humble Heart, a lowly Spirit, and a &s;ober and teachable Temper For in o|thers they are very apt to beget a &s;e|cret and refined Pride, an over-ween|ing and over-bearing Vanity (the mo&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
oppo&s;ite Temper to the true Go&s;pel|Spirit, which, without Offence, I may &s;uppo&s;e to be the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind) that tempts them to pre&s;ume on a Kind of Omni&s;cience, in Re&s;pect of their Fellow-Creatures, that have not ri&s;en to their Elevation; and to &s;et up for an Infallibility, or at lea&s;t a de|ci&s;ive Judgment, even in Matters which do not admit of a <HI>more</HI> or <HI>le&s;s</HI> (their proper Object) of which Kind what|ever relates to the infinite Author of our Being most certainly is. Upon all which Accounts, con&s;cious of my own Weakne&s;s, I have long &s;ince bid them an Adieu, farther than as they &s;erve to amu&s;e, or are u&s;eful in the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ities of Life.</P>
<P>The Defence of that Book against the learned and acute Mr. <HI>Abr. de Moivre,</HI> being written in a Spirit of Levity and Re&s;entment, I most &s;in|cerely
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
retract, and wi&s;h undone, &s;o far as it is per&s;onal or peevi&s;h, and ask him and the World Pardon for it; as I do for the <HI>Defence</HI> of Dr. <HI>Pit|cairn's Di&s;&s;ertations,</HI> and the <HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> against the late learned and ingenious Dr. <HI>Oliphant.</HI> I heartily condemn and detest all per|&s;onal Reflexions, all malicious and un|mannerly Turns, and all fal&s;e and unju&s;t Repre&s;entations, as unbecoming Gentlemen, Scholars, and Chri&s;tians; and di&s;prove and undo both Performan|ces, as far as in me lies, in every Thing that does not &s;trictly and barely relate to the Argument.</P>
<P>The first Part of the <HI>Philo&s;ophi|cal Principles,</HI> that of <HI>Natural Re|ligion,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts merely of Di&s;cour&s;es and Lectures of <HI>Natural Philo&s;o|phy,</HI> and of its Con&s;equences on <HI>Reli|gion,</HI> occa&s;ionally read or di&s;cour&s;ed
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
to that mo&s;t noble and great Per&s;on, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> who is now &s;o great an Ornament to his Country, and his high Employments, to whom they were in&s;cribed. I thought they might be of U&s;e to other young Gentle|men, who, while they were learning the Elements of natural Philo&s;ophy, might have thereby the Principles of natural Religion in&s;en&s;ibly in&s;tilled in|to them. And accordingly it has been and is &s;till u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e at both Univer&s;ities. Upon which Account, upon proper Occa&s;ions, I will not fail to improve it in all the new Di&s;cove|ries in Experimental Philo&s;ophy, or in the final and natural Cau&s;es of Things as happen to be made, &s;o as to leave it as little imperfect in its Kind as I po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Part of the <HI>Philo&s;o|phical Principles,</HI> to wit, that of
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
<HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> was added after|ward, to &s;hew, that all our Knowledge of Nature was by Analogy, or the Relations of Things only, and not their real Nature, Sub&s;tance, or internal Principles: That from this Method of Analogy (the only Medium of hu|mane Knowlege) we &s;hould be nece&s;&s;a|rily led, to conclude the Attributes or Qualities of the &s;upreme and ab&s;olute Infinite, were indeed analogous to the Properties or Qualities of finite Beings, but only in &s;uch a Manner as the Diffe|rence between Infinite and Finite re|quires; and that therefore, not being able to know preci&s;ely the&s;e Differences, we ought implicitely to believe without rea&s;oning what is revealed to us concern|ing the Nature of the infinite Being; or bring our Rea&s;on to &s;ubmit to the My&s;teries of Faith. How I have &s;uc|ceeded is not for me to determine. As the End was honest, I am &s;ecure the great
<PB N="x" REF="12">
Principles and the fundamental Propo|&s;itions are true and ju&s;t. They may want a little farther clearing up and Explication: But as yet I have met with no Rea&s;on to retract any Thing material; el&s;e I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly do it.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Gout and</HI> Bath <HI>Waters</HI> was brought forth by mere Accident. The fir&s;t Draught being, as I there mentioned, only a Paper of Di|rections for a Gentleman, my Friend and Patient, troubled with the Gout. It was enlarged upon different Occa|&s;ions, and publi&s;hed to prevent its be|ing pyrated; &s;everal Copies having been given out to others in the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances. I have the Satisfaction to know from many different Hands, that it has benefited great Numbers of in|firm and afflicted Per&s;ons; and &s;hall
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
therefore go on to cultivate it as far as my poor Abilities will permit.</P>
<P>I am now come to this my last Pro|duction; who&s;e Origin was as ca&s;ual as that of my former. My good and worthy Friend, the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> having been last Autumn at <HI>Bath</HI> for a Confirmation of his Health, at his Departure de&s;ired of me to draw up &s;ome In&s;tructions in writing to direct him in the Conduct of his Health for the future, and in the Manner of &s;up|porting his Spirits free and full, under the great Bu&s;ine&s;s he is engaged in. I was then in the Hurry of our Sea&s;on, and could not &s;o &s;oon an&s;wer his Ex|pectation, as his real Worth, and my &s;incere E&s;teem required. I thought my|&s;elf therefore the more obliged a&s;&s;oon as I had Lei&s;ure, to exert my&s;elf to the uttermost in Obedience to his Com|mands. At first I drew up most of
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
the&s;e Rules at the End of the &s;everal Chapters; but, upon Reflexion, thought it not Re&s;pect enough to his good Ta&s;te and Capacity to judge of the Rea&s;ons of Things, to pre&s;cribe him bare and dry Directions in Matters of &s;o great Moment. I added therefore the philo|&s;ophical Account and Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Rules, which make up the Bulk of the Chapters them&s;elves. He, out of his Love to his Fellow-Citizens (which is one &s;hining Part of his Character, and which I ought to &s;uppo&s;e has in this In&s;tance only impo&s;ed on his better Judgment) de&s;ired they might be made publick. Upon which Account &s;everal Things have been &s;ince added, to make the whole of more general U&s;e. If there|fore any Thing in this Treati&s;e be tole|rable, or if any Per&s;on receive Benefit by it, they owe it entirely to that ex|cellent Per&s;on, upon who&s;e Account
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
&s;olely it was undertaken, and at who&s;e Request it is publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I have indeed long and often ob|&s;erved, with great Pity and Regret, many very learned, ingenious, and even religious Per&s;ons, who being weak and tender (as &s;uch generally are) have &s;uf|fered to the la&s;t Extremity for Want of a due Regimen of Diet, and other general Directions of Health, who had good Sen&s;e enough to under&s;tand the Force and Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch Rules, valued Health &s;ufficiently, and de&s;pi&s;ed &s;en|&s;ual Gratifications for the Plea&s;ures of the Mind &s;o far, as to be able and willing to ab&s;tain from every Thing hurtful, deny them&s;elves any Thing their Appetites craved, and to con|form to any Rules for a tolerable De|gree of Health, Ea&s;e, and Freedom of Spirits; and yet being ignorant how
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">
to conduct them&s;elves, from what to ab&s;tain and what to u&s;e, they have &s;uffered even to mortal Agonies; who, had they been better directed and in|&s;tructed, had pa&s;s'd their Lives in to|lerable Ea&s;e and Quiet. It is for the&s;e, and the&s;e only, the following Treati&s;e is de&s;igned. The Robu&s;t, the Luxurious, the Pot-Companions, the Loo&s;e, and the Abandoned, have here no Bu&s;ine&s;s; their Time is not yet come. But the Sickly and the Aged, the Studious and the Sedentary, Per|&s;ons of weak Nerves, and the Gen|tlemen of the learned Profe&s;&s;ions, I hope, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing on the following Treati&s;e, may be enabled to follow their Studies and Profe&s;&s;ions with greater Security and Applica|tion, and yet pre&s;erve their Health and Freedom of Spirits more entire and to a longer Date. I am morally cer|tain,
<PB N="xv" REF="17">
had I known and been as well &s;atisfied of the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Rules here laid down, thirty Years ago, as I am now, I had &s;uffered le&s;s, and had had a greater Freedom of Spirits than I have enjoy'd. But every Thing is best as it has been, except the Er|rors and Failings of our free Wills.</P>
<P>I know no u&s;eful Means of Health and Long Life I have omitted, nor any pernicious Cu&s;tom I have not noted; and have given the plainest and most familiar Rea&s;ons I could urge for the Rules I have here laid down. Most of my Arguments (as they needs mu&s;t) have ri&s;en out of the animal Functions and Oeconomy: And I have u&s;ed as little Subtilty and Refinement in my Explications of the&s;e, as the pre&s;ent State of Natural Philo&s;ophy could ad|mit. I have been often contented with
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
plain and obvious Facts to account for Appearances, and the Cautions thence deduced; when, according to the Hu|mour of the pre&s;ent Age, I might have run into refined Speculations of Meta|phy&s;icks, or Mathematicks; being con|tented with the <HI>Cra&s;&s;o Modo philo|&s;ophari</HI>; becau&s;e we &s;hall never be able to &s;earch out the Works of the Almighty to Perfection, &s;o as to pe|netrate the internal Nature of Things.</P>
<P>I have con&s;ulted nothing but my own Experience and Ob&s;ervation on my own crazy Carca&s;e and the Infir|mities of others I have treated, in the following Rules, their Rea&s;ons and Philo&s;ophy, (&s;o that if any Thing is borrowed, it has occurred to me as my own) but in &s;o far as Authorities go to &s;horten philo&s;ophical Accounts. Not but that all &s;y&s;tematick Writers in
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">
Phy&s;ick, and many particular Authors, have treated the &s;ame Subject: But their Rules, be&s;ides that they are of|ten incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, or con|trary to Experience, are &s;o general, and expre&s;s'd in &s;o unlimited and un|defined Terms, as leave little or no Certainty in them; when apply'd to particular Ca&s;es, they want the nece&s;|&s;ary Preci&s;ion and Exactne&s;s, and &s;o became u&s;ele&s;s or perplexing: and la&s;t|ly, when they come, (which is rarely to be found among them) to give the Rea&s;ons and Philo&s;ophy of their Di|rections, they have not the Per&s;picuity and natural Way of convincing the in|genious, &s;ickly, and tender Sufferers, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to make them chearfully and readily undergo &s;uch &s;evere Re|&s;traints; which I take to be by far the most difficult Part of &s;uch a Work, and which I have laboured with my utmost Power to &s;upply.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="20">I know not what may be the Fate and Succe&s;s of this Performance; nor am I &s;olicitous about it, being con&s;cious the De&s;ign was honest, the Subject weighty, and the Execution the best my Time, my Abilities, and my Health would permit, which cannot bear the Labour of much Fileing and Fini&s;hing. Being careful not to incroach on the Province of the Phy&s;ician, I have con|cealed nothing my Knowledge could &s;uggest to direct the Sufferer, in the best Manner I could, to pre&s;erve his Health and lengthen out his Life: And I have held out no fal&s;e or delu|&s;ory Lights to lead him a&s;tray, or tor|ment him unnece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible any Set of Men could be offended at my Performance, it might be my Brethren of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="xix" REF="21">
for endeavouring to le&s;&s;en the <HI>Materia Morbifica.</HI> But as this would be the most malicious, unjust, and unworthy Reflexion could be thrown on Scholars and Gentlemen of a liberal Education; &s;o I never enter|tain'd the mo&s;t remote Vanity to think any Endeavour of mine would make &s;o con&s;iderable a Change in the Na|tion; e&s;pecially when the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h were on the o|ther Side of the Que&s;tion, which have &s;tood their Ground even against the Rules of Life and Immortality brought to Light by the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this tedious Pre|face without begging Pardon of the Reader for troubling him with my pri|vate Matters. All I can &s;ay as an Apo|logy is, that of what&s;oever Indiffe|rence my Concerns as an Author may
<PB N="xx" REF="22">
be to him, yet they were not &s;o to me; this being the only Place and Time I may have to adjust them in, and it being the Heighth of my Ambi|tion,</P>

<P>_IT is a common Say|ing, That every Man pa&s;t Forty is either a <HI>Fool</HI> or a <HI>Phy&s;ician:</HI> It might have been as ju&s;tly added, that he was a <HI>Divine</HI> too: For, as the World goes at pre&s;ent, there is not any Thing that the Generality of the better Sort of Mankind &s;o lavi&s;hly and &s;o unconcern|edly throw away as <HI>Health,</HI> except <HI>eter|nal Felicity.</HI> Mo&s;t Men know when they
<PB N="2" REF="48">
are ill, but very few when they are well. And yet it is mo&s;t certain, that 'tis ea|&s;ier to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> Health than to <HI>recover</HI> it, and to <HI>prevent</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es than to <HI>cure</HI> them. Towards the fir&s;t, the Means are mo&s;tly in our own Power: Little el&s;e is required than to <HI>bear and forbear.</HI> But towards the latter, the Means are perplexed and uncertain; and for the Knowledge of them the far greate&s;t Part of Mankind mu&s;t apply to others, of who&s;e Skill and Hone&s;ty they are in a great mea&s;ure ignorant, and the Benefit of who&s;e Art they can but conditionally and precautiou&s;ly obtain. A crazy Con|&s;titution, original weak Nerves, dear|bought Experience in Things helpful and hurtful, and long Ob&s;ervation on the Complaints of others, who came for Relief to this univer&s;al Infirmary, <HI>BATH,</HI> have at la&s;t (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) taught me &s;ome of the mo&s;t effectual Means of pre&s;erving Health and prolonging Life in tho&s;e who are <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>&s;ickly,</HI> and labour under <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers. And I thought I could not &s;pend my lei&s;ure Hours better than by putting together the mo&s;t gene|ral Rules for that Purpo&s;e, and &s;etting them in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Light I could, for the Benefit of tho&s;e who

<P>The Reflection is not more common than ju&s;t, That he who lives <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> mu&s;t live mi&s;erably.

'Tis, as a <HI>Poet</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>to die for fear of Dying.</HI> And to forbear or give over a ju&s;t, charitable, or even generous Office of Life, from a too &s;crupulous Regard to Health, is un|worthy of a <HI>Man,</HI> much more of a <HI>Chri|&s;tian.</HI> But then, on the other Hand, to cut off our Days by <HI>Intemperance, Indi|&s;cretion,</HI> and guilty <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> to live mi|&s;erably for the &s;ake of gratifying a <HI>&s;weet Tooth,</HI> or a brutal <HI>Itch</HI>; to die <HI>Martyrs</HI> to our <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Wantonne&s;s,</HI> is equal|ly beneath the Dignity of <HI>human Nature,</HI> and contrary to the <HI>Homage</HI> we owe to the <HI>Author</HI> of our Being.

<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, That when <HI>Gentlemen</HI> build <HI>Seats,</HI> they ought never to place them upon any high <HI>Hill,</HI> very near any great <HI>Confluence</HI> of Water, in the Neigh|bourhood of any great <HI>Mines,</HI> or Beds of <HI>Minerals,</HI> nor on any &s;wamp, mar&s;hy, or mo&s;&s;y Foundation; but either in a <HI>cham|paign</HI> Country, or on the <HI>Side</HI> of a &s;mall Eminence, &s;heltered from the <HI>North</HI> and

<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Winds, or upon a light gravelly Soil. The Nature of the Soil will be well known from the <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Herbs</HI> that grow on it, or rather more &s;ecurely from the Nature of the <HI>Waters</HI> that &s;pring out of it, which ought always to be <HI>&s;weet, clear, light, &s;oft,</HI> and <HI>ta&s;tle&s;s.</HI> All high <HI>Mountains</HI> are damp, as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> ob&s;erved at <HI>St. Helena,</HI> a moun|tainous Place, where <HI>Damps</HI> fell &s;o per|petually in the Night time, that he was obliged to be every Moment wiping his <HI>Gla&s;&s;es,</HI> in making his <HI>A&s;tronomical</HI> Ob&s;ervations.

<P>The Meat of <HI>England</HI> is gene|rally <HI>animal</HI> Sub&s;tances. The <HI>Animals</HI> them&s;elves, from <HI>epidemick</HI> Cau&s;es, bad Food, Age, or other Infirmities, have their Di&s;ea&s;es as well as <HI>human</HI> Crea|tures: and the&s;e di&s;ea&s;ed <HI>Animals</HI> can never be proper or &s;ound Food for Men. Adult <HI>Animals</HI> abound more in <HI>urinous Salts</HI> than young ones: Their Parts are more clo&s;ely compacted, becau&s;e more forcibly united; and &s;o harder of Dige|&s;tion. 'Tis true, the great Di&s;tinction of the <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Unfitne&s;s</HI> of the &s;everal Sorts of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> for hu|man Food, depends upon their <HI>original Make, Frame,</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> (and that can be found out only by Experience) as al&s;o upon the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Ta&s;te, <HI>Complexion, Tem|perament,</HI> and <HI>Habits</HI> of the Per&s;on that feeds on them. But by the Help of the&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="67">
<HI>Three</HI> Principles, <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> That the <HI>Strength</HI> or Weakne&s;s of Cohe&s;ion of the Particles of fluid Bodies, depends up|on their <HI>Bigne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Smallne&s;s</HI>; that is, the <HI>bigge&s;t</HI> Particles cohere more firmly, than the <HI>&s;maller,</HI> becau&s;e more Parts come into Contact in large Bodies than &s;mall, and &s;o their <HI>Union</HI> is greater. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the <HI>greater</HI> the Force [<HI>Momentum</HI>] is, with which two Bodies meet, the &s;tronger is their Cohe&s;ion, and the more difficult their Separation. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that <HI>Salts,</HI> being comprehended by plain <HI>Sur|faces,</HI> being <HI>hard,</HI> and in all Changes recovering their Figure, unite the mo&s;t firmly of any Bodies what&s;oever: Their plain <HI>Surfaces</HI> bring many Points into <HI>Contact</HI> and <HI>Union:</HI> Their <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> and con&s;tant <HI>Figure</HI> make them <HI>durable</HI> and <HI>unalterable</HI>; and thereby the <HI>active Prin|ciples,</HI> and the Origin of the Qualities of Bodies; and when they approach with|in the <HI>Sphere</HI> of one another's <HI>Activity,</HI> they firmly unite in <HI>Clu&s;ters</HI>; all which make the Separation of their original <HI>Particles</HI> the more difficult.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. All other Things being &s;uppo&s;ed equal, tho&s;e <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals,</HI> that come to <HI>Maturity</HI> the &s;oone&s;t, are <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> of <HI>Dige&s;tion.</HI> Thus the Spring <HI>Vegetables,</HI> as <HI>A&s;paragus, Straw-berries,</HI> and &s;ome Sorts of <HI>Sallading,</HI> are more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted than <HI>Pears, Apples, Pea|ches,</HI> and <HI>Nectarines</HI>; becau&s;e they have le&s;s of the <HI>&s;olar</HI> Fire in them; their Parts are united by a weaker Heat; that is, with le&s;s <HI>Velocity,</HI> and abound le&s;s in, nay &s;carce have any &s;trong and fixed <HI>Salts.</HI> Among the <HI>Animals,</HI> the com|mon Poultry, <HI>Hares, Sheep, Kids, Rab|bets, &amp;c.</HI> who in the &s;ame, or a few Years come to their <HI>Maturity</HI> (that is, to propagate their <HI>Species</HI>) are much more tender and readily dige&s;ted than <HI>Cows,</HI> Hor&s;es, or A&s;&s;es, (were the&s;e la&s;t in u&s;e for Food, as they have been in <HI>Famine</HI>) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Rea&s;on already given, be|cau&s;e their Parts cohere le&s;s firmly. And it is ob&s;ervable, of the <HI>Vegetables,</HI> which are longe&s;t a ripening, that is, who&s;e <HI>Juices</HI> have mo&s;t of the <HI>&s;olar</HI> Rays
<PB N="23" REF="69">
in them, that their <HI>fermented Juices</HI> yield the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>vinous</HI> Spirits; as Grapes, Elder-berries, and the like: and of the <HI>Animals</HI> that are longe&s;t in coming to <HI>Maturity,</HI> that their <HI>Juices</HI> yield the mo&s;t rank and mo&s;t <HI>foetid</HI> urinous <HI>Salts.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Other Things &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>equal,</HI> the <HI>larger</HI> and <HI>bigger</HI> the <HI>Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Ani|mal</HI> is, in its Kind, the <HI>&s;tronger</HI> and the <HI>harder</HI> to dige&s;t is the Food made thereof. Thus a large <HI>Onion, Apple,</HI> or <HI>Pear,</HI> and large <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> are <HI>harder</HI> to di|ge&s;t than the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> ones, of the &s;ame Kind; not only, as their Ve&s;&s;els being &s;tronger and more <HI>ela&s;tick,</HI> their Parts are brought together with a <HI>greater</HI> Force; but al&s;o, becau&s;e the <HI>Qualities</HI> are pro|portionably more inten&s;e in great Bodies of the &s;ame Kind: Thus, other Things being equal, a <HI>greater</HI> Fire is proportion|ably more inten&s;ely hot, than a le&s;&s;er one; and the Wine contained in a larger Ve&s;&s;el becomes &s;tronger than that con|tained in a le&s;&s;er; and con&s;equently the Juices of larger <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> are more rank than the Juices of &s;maller ones of the &s;ame Kind.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="24" REF="70">3. Other Things being equal, The pro|per Food appointed for <HI>Animals</HI> by Na|ture, is ea&s;ier dige&s;ted than the <HI>Animals</HI> them&s;elves; tho&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> that live on <HI>Vegetables,</HI> than tho&s;e that live on <HI>Ani|mals</HI>; tho&s;e that live on <HI>Vegetables</HI> or <HI>Animals,</HI> that &s;oone&s;t come to <HI>Maturi|ty,</HI> than tho&s;e that live on &s;uch as are longer a ripening. Thus <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Eggs</HI> are lighter of Dige&s;tion than the Fle&s;h of <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Birds</HI>; <HI>Pullets</HI> and <HI>Turkies,</HI> than <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Gee&s;e</HI>; and <HI>Partridge,</HI> and <HI>Phea&s;ant</HI> are <HI>lighter</HI> than <HI>Woodcock</HI> or <HI>Snipe</HI>; becau&s;e the&s;e la&s;t, being <HI>long-bil|led,</HI> &s;uck only <HI>animal</HI> Juices; and for the Rea&s;ons already given, <HI>Gra&s;s Beef</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> are lighter than <HI>&s;tall-fed Ox|en</HI> and <HI>Sheep.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. All Things el&s;e being alike, <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Sea-Animals</HI> are <HI>harder</HI> to dige&s;t than <HI>Land-Animals</HI>; becau&s;e univer&s;al|ly their Food is other <HI>Animals,</HI> and the <HI>Salt Element</HI> in which they live compacts their Parts more firmly; <HI>Salts</HI> having a &s;tronger Power of <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> than other Bodies. And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, <HI>Salt Water Fi&s;h</HI> is harder to dige&s;t than <HI>fre&s;h</HI> Water. Thus the <HI>Sea Tortoi&s;e</HI> is harder
<PB N="25" REF="71">
to dige&s;t than the <HI>Land Tortoi&s;e</HI>; and <HI>Sturgeon</HI> and <HI>Turbit,</HI> than <HI>Trout</HI> or <HI>Perch.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Other Things being equal, <HI>Vegeta|bles</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> that abound in an <HI>oily, fat,</HI> and <HI>glutinous</HI> Sub&s;tance, are <HI>harder</HI> to dige&s;t, than tho&s;e of a <HI>dry, fle&s;hy, fibrous</HI> Sub&s;tance; becau&s;e <HI>oily</HI> and <HI>fat</HI> Sub&s;tan|ces clude the Force and Action of the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers; and their Parts at|tract one another, and unite more &s;trong|ly than other Sub&s;tances do, (except Salts) as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Edition of Light and Colours.</NOTE> ob&s;erves. Their <HI>Softne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Humidity</HI> relaxes and weak|ens the Force of the Stomach, and the Fat and Oil it&s;elf is &s;hut up in little <HI>Bladders,</HI> that are with Difficulty broken. Thus <HI>Nuts</HI> of all kinds pa&s;s through the <HI>Guts,</HI> almo&s;t untouched: <HI>Olives</HI> are har|der to dige&s;t than <HI>Pea&s;e</HI>; <HI>fat</HI> fle&s;h Meat, than the <HI>lean</HI> of the &s;ame. <HI>Carp, Tench, Salmon, Eel,</HI> and <HI>Turbit,</HI> are much harder to dige&s;t than <HI>Whiting, Perch, Trout,</HI> or <HI>Haddock.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals,</HI> all Things el&s;e being alike, who&s;e Sub&s;tance is <HI>white,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="72">
or inclining to the <HI>lighter</HI> Colours, are <HI>lighter</HI> to dige&s;t, than tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> is <HI>redder, browner,</HI> or inclining towards the more flaming Colours; not only be|cau&s;e the Parts that reflect <HI>white,</HI> and the lighter Colours are le&s;&s;er in Bulk than tho&s;e that reflect the more flaming Colours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the ju&s;t quoted Author.</NOTE>; but al&s;o becau&s;e tho&s;e of the more flaming Colours abound more with urinious Salts. Thus <HI>Turnips, Par&s;nips,</HI> and <HI>Potatoes,</HI> are lighter than <HI>Carrots, Skirrets,</HI> and <HI>Beet-Raves. Pullet, Tur|key, Phea&s;ant,</HI> and <HI>Rabbet,</HI> are lighter than <HI>Duck, Gee&s;e, Woodcock,</HI> and <HI>Snipe.

Veal</HI> and <HI>Lamb</HI> is lighter than <HI>Red</HI> or <HI>Fallow</HI> Deer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> All other Things being e|qual, <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> of a <HI>&s;trong, poignant, aromatick</HI> and hot Ta&s;te, are <HI>harder</HI> to dige&s;t than tho&s;e of a <HI>milder, &s;ofter,</HI> and more <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> Ta&s;te.

<P>There is nothing more certain, than that the greater Superiority the <HI>con|coctive</HI> Powers have, over the <HI>Food,</HI> or the &s;tronger the <HI>concoctive Powers</HI> are, in regard of the Things to be <HI>concocted</HI>; the <HI>finer</HI> the <HI>Chyle</HI> will be, the <HI>Circula|tion</HI> the more free, and the <HI>Spirits</HI> more light&s;ome; that is, the better will the Health be.

And if any Error &s;hould be committed, 'tis be&s;t to err on the &s;afe&s;t Side, and rather chu&s;e tho&s;e Things that are under our <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers, than tho&s;e that are above them. And in the Choice of <HI>Animals</HI> for our Food, we

mu&s;t not pa&s;s over the Manner of fatten|ing and fitting them up for the Table. About <HI>London</HI> we can &s;carce have any, but cramm'd <HI>Poultry,</HI> or <HI>&s;tall-fed</HI> Butche|ry Meat. It were &s;ufficient to di&s;gu&s;t the &s;toute&s;t Stomach, to &s;ee the foul, gro&s;s, and na&s;ty <HI>Manner,</HI> in which, and the <HI>fetid,</HI> putrid and unwhole&s;ome <HI>Ma|terials,</HI> with which they are fed. Perpe|tual Foulne&s;s and Cramming, gro&s;s Food and Na&s;tine&s;s, we know, will putrify the <HI>Juices</HI> and mortify the <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Sub&s;tance of <HI>human</HI> Creatures; and &s;ure they can do no le&s;s in Brute <HI>Animals,</HI> and thus make even our Food Poi&s;on. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of hot Beds, and forcing <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables.</HI> The only Way of having &s;ound and healthful <HI>animal</HI> Food, is to leave them to their own <HI>na|tural Liberty,</HI> in the free Air, and their own proper <HI>Element,</HI> with Plenty of Food, and due Cleanne&s;s, and a Shelter from the Injuries of the Weather, when they have a Mind to retire to it.

every Thing <HI>Good</HI> that he had made. Nor &s;eem the <HI>Coele&s;tial</HI> Bodies to have e&s;caped, &s;o far as they regard us.

They effect a brisk and lively <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Fluids, cri&s;p</HI> up and <HI>con&s;trict</HI> the Solids for &s;ome &s;hort Time. Thus &s;udden <HI>Gu&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> or <HI>Grief, Plea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>Pain,</HI> &s;timulate and &s;pur the <HI>Nervous</HI> Fibres, and the <HI>Coats</HI> of the <HI>Animal Tubes,</HI> and thereby give a <HI>Celerity</HI> and brisker Motion to their included Fluids, for the &s;ame Time. And the <HI>Functions</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Lungs</HI> being <HI>involuntary,</HI> they have their more immediate Effects upon them. Thus both &s;udden <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> make us <HI>breath</HI> &s;hort and quick, and make our <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> &s;mall and frequent. The retaining our <HI>Breath</HI> for &s;ome Time (for &s;o far our <HI>Breathing</HI> is <HI>volun|tary</HI>) to reflect more <HI>inten&s;ely</HI> upon the painful Object, forces at la&s;t a &s;trong <HI>Ex&s;piration,</HI> which becomes a <HI>Sigh.</HI> Thus a &s;udden painful <HI>Idea,</HI> makes a quicker <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood, and thereby throwing a greater

<PB N="155" REF="203">
<HI>Pul&s;e</HI> is found quick and &s;mall, and the <HI>Breath</HI> thick and difficult, as Experience &s;hews.

The &s;udden <HI>Gu&s;ts</HI> of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions being thus ac|counted for, when they become ex|treme, they drive about the <HI>Blood</HI> with &s;uch a Hurricane, that Nature is over|&s;et, like a <HI>Mill</HI> by a <HI>Flood:</HI> So that what drove it only quicker round before, now intirely &s;tops it, and renders the Countenance <HI>pale</HI> and <HI>gha&s;tly.</HI> Sudden and great <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Grief,</HI> do &s;o convul&s;e the Nervous <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> that &s;ometimes they alter the Po&s;ition of the Parts, and fix them in a new one.

<P>MENTION having been &s;o often made of <HI>Chronical,</HI> and &s;ome|times of <HI>Acute</HI> Di&s;tempers, it may be con|venient here, to &s;ugge&s;t to the Readers, as clear an Account of their Nature and Difference, as I po&s;&s;ibly can. <HI>Acute</HI> Di&s;tempers, then, are under&s;tood, Such as within &s;ome &s;hort <HI>limited Time</HI> have their Periods, either of a perfect <HI>Cri&s;e,</HI> and &s;ub&s;equent Recovery, or of putting an End to the <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> both together; and are therefore called
<PB N="173" REF="221">
<HI>quick, &s;harp</HI> or <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;tempers, who&s;e Symptoms are more violent, their Dura|tion &s;horter, and their Periods more <HI>quick,</HI> either of <HI>&s;udden Death,</HI> or a glorious <HI>Victory</HI> over the Di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e are generally limited within <HI>Forty Days.</HI> And tho&s;e that run out longer, turn into <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, who&s;e Periods are more &s;low, their <HI>Symptoms</HI> le&s;s &s;evere, and their <HI>Duration</HI> longer. They too (if new Fuel were not ad|mini&s;tred to them) would, by the Cour&s;e of <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> have their <HI>Periods,</HI> and ter|minate at the la&s;t. The <HI>Vi&s;cidity</HI> of the <HI>Juices,</HI> and the <HI>Flaccidity</HI> of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> would, in a great mea&s;ure, and to &s;ome very tolerable Degree, by <HI>proper Reme|dies,</HI> and a due <HI>Regimen,</HI> be removed, and the Party recover in <HI>the&s;e,</HI> as well as <HI>acute</HI> Ca&s;es. But this requiring long Time, much Care, and great Caution, unwearied Patience and Per&s;everance, and &s;o long a Cour&s;e of <HI>Self-denial,</HI> as few People are willing to undergo, it is become the <HI>Reproach</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> that <HI>acute</HI> Ca&s;es cure them|&s;elves (or rather Nature cures them) and <HI>chronical</HI> Ca&s;es are never cured. But both the Branches of the Reflexion
<PB N="174" REF="222">
are equally fal&s;e. In the Fir&s;t, <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Care,</HI> judiciou&s;ly applied, will al|ways <HI>alleviate</HI> the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and Suffer|ing, will help on Nature to the <HI>Relief</HI> &s;he points out, and quicken the <HI>Cri&s;e,</HI> which it will con&s;tantly bring about, if the <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> is not too &s;trong for the <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI> And even then it will <HI>mitigate</HI> the <HI>Pain,</HI> and lay the <HI>Patient</HI> gently and ea&s;ily down. But in the <HI>la&s;t Ca&s;e,</HI> if due Care be had, to follow time|ou&s;ly the Advice of an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>expe|rienced Phy&s;ician,</HI> a <HI>Period</HI> certainly may be brought about to mo&s;t <HI>chronical Di|&s;tempers,</HI> where the great <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> are not &s;poiled and de&s;troyed. The Fail|ing is in the <HI>Patient</HI> him&s;elf, who will not, or cannot, <HI>deny him&s;elf</HI> for a Time &s;ufficient to bring about the <HI>Cure.</HI> Some <HI>chronical Di&s;tempers</HI> indeed are &s;uch, either by having gone <HI>too far,</HI> or by being <HI>Hereditary,</HI> and interwoven with the <HI>Principles</HI> of Life, as never to be totally overcome. And then 'tis a Piece of <HI>great Wi&s;dom,</HI> to know how far their Con&s;titution will go, and &s;it down contented with that <HI>mea&s;ure of Health</HI> their <HI>original</HI> Frame will admit of. But of this I am morally certain, If the <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Cautions</HI> laid down in this <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="223">
be <HI>carefully, &s;teadily,</HI> and <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> ob|&s;erved, few <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers but will receive &s;uch <HI>Relief</HI> and <HI>Alleviation</HI> by them, as to make Life <HI>tolerably ea&s;y,</HI> and free from <HI>grievous Sufferings:</HI> And in the mentioned <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> that is all that is left for <HI>Art</HI> to do. But in other <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers taken in <HI>due Time,</HI> where the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> are not quite &s;poiled, they would infallibly bring about a <HI>final Period,</HI> and perfect Cure. The mo&s;t certain di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of an <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;temper, is, To have a <HI>quick Pul&s;e</HI>; that of a <HI>Chronical,</HI> To have a <HI>&s;low</HI> one. The fir&s;t will exhau&s;t the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and wear out the <HI>Solids</HI> in a <HI>&s;hort</HI> Time; whereas the <HI>la&s;t</HI> will require a longer Time to produce the &s;ame Effect. Some <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, e&s;pecially towards the <HI>la&s;t</HI> and <HI>fatal</HI> Period, turn <HI>acute.</HI> And &s;ome <HI>acute</HI> ones terminate in <HI>chro|nical</HI> Di&s;tempers.

So while the <HI>original Foldings</HI> and <HI>Complications</HI> of

the <HI>Solids</HI> are not yet quite extended, this <HI>Irritation</HI> &s;erves only to draw them out, and does not hurt them, till they are arrived at their full <HI>Extent,</HI> which generally happens about Five-and|twenty.

<P>In fine, Providence has been kind and gracious to us beyond all Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in furni&s;hing us with a certain <HI>Relief,</HI> if not a Remedy, even to our mo&s;t <HI>inten&s;e Pains</HI> and <HI>extreme Mi&s;eries.</HI> When our Patience can hold out no longer, and our Pains are at la&s;t come to be <HI>in&s;upportable,</HI> we have always ready at Hand a Medicine, which is not only a pre&s;ent Relief, but, I may &s;ay, a &s;tanding and <HI>con&s;tant Miracle.</HI> Tho&s;e only who have wanted it mo&s;t, and have felt its friendly and kind Help in their Tortures, can be&s;t tell its <HI>wonderful Effects,</HI> and the great <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of Him who has be&s;towed it on us. I mean <HI>Opium,</HI> and its Solution <HI>Laudanum,</HI> which, when properly pre&s;cribed, and prudently managed, is a mo&s;t <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>&s;udden</HI> Relief in all <HI>exqui&s;ite</HI> and <HI>inten&s;e</HI> Pain. The <HI>Manner of its Ope|ration</HI> may be gathered, from the Ob|&s;ervations I have made in the preceding Treati&s;e. Pain con&s;tricts, cri&s;ps up, &s;hortens and contracts animal Fibres. It acts like a Wedge in tearing, rending and dividing the&s;e &s;mall Filaments; it does to them in a living Body, what the Points of Salts do to all animal Sub|&s;tances,
<PB N="214" REF="262">
which are to be pre&s;erved for Food, <HI>viz.</HI> hardens, &s;tiffens and con|tracts them. The Fibres of live Ani|mals being contractile, tonick and &s;pringy, when a hard pointed Body enters them (which is the Ca&s;e in all bodily Pain) the Parts by their con|tractile Nature, fly from, recede, and &s;hun, as much as po&s;&s;ibly they can, the wounding In&s;trument. This ap|pears in the large Ga&s;h of a Wound, made acro&s;s the Fibres of a Mu&s;cle; in the continual Bending towards the other Side, when any Part of one is pained; in the <HI>Cramps</HI> and <HI>Con|vul&s;ions,</HI> nay, and &s;ometimes <HI>Fevers,</HI> produced by inten&s;e <HI>acute Pain.</HI> Plea|&s;ure, on the contrary, <HI>relaxes</HI> the Fibres by a gentle, &s;oft, and bland, or (as the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> &s;peak) a commen&s;urate and harmonious Touch. It acts on the Fibres as two uni&s;on and concordant mu|&s;ical In&s;truments act on one another, and by &s;troaking, &s;oftening and &s;moothing, comes at la&s;t intirely to relax and un|bend them. The Parts of the Fibres run after, follow and pur&s;ue, and at la&s;t break their Union in &s;ome Degree, to reach &s;uch a demulcent Touch. Some Per&s;ons have had the Faculty to
<PB N="215" REF="263">
allay Pain, by gently &s;moothing the afflicted Part with their Hands; which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure was true of the <HI>Touching Doctor.</HI> Soft Oils, and emol|lient Herbs, with gentle Warmth, by <HI>relaxing</HI> the cri&s;ped Fibres, will allay <HI>Pain.</HI> Soft Beds and Cloaths, and tepid Baths will relax and weaken the whole Habit. Now &s;ince Pain &s;o cer|tainly cri&s;ps up, con&s;tricts and <HI>contracts</HI> animal Fibres, and &s;ince <HI>Opiates</HI> in|fallibly, if duly do&s;ed, relieve and <HI>ea&s;e</HI> Pain, I can &s;ee no po&s;&s;ible Way it can effect that, but by <HI>relaxing</HI> and <HI>un|bending</HI> the&s;e Fibres as much, or near as much, as Pain contracts and draws them up. And that this is the real Fact, we may ob&s;erve from many Effects of <HI>Opiates.</HI> 1. Nothing is &s;o powerful, or &s;o certain a <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> as an <HI>Opiate.</HI> Nothing cau&s;es &s;uch plenti|ful Sweating, e&s;pecially if joined with <HI>Volatiles,</HI> and promoted with plentiful drinking &s;mall, warm Liquors. This it can do only by relaxing the Fibres of the Skin and Per&s;piratory Glands. 2. Nothing &s;o much <HI>palls</HI> the <HI>Appetite,</HI> and <HI>weakens</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Dige&s;tions,</HI> as the frequent U&s;e of <HI>Opiates</HI>; in&s;omuch, that mo&s;t People, after a liberal Do&s;e of
<PB N="216" REF="264">
them, &s;eldom fail to reach, and never care for Food for a con&s;iderable Time after, till their Effects are wrought off; which are the con&s;tant Symptoms of a <HI>relaxed Stomach and Guts.</HI> 3. Nothing &s;o much promotes the <HI>Eruption</HI> of the Small-Pox and Mea&s;les, the <HI>Expul&s;ion</HI> of the Stone and Foetus, the Monthly, and the After-Birth <HI>Purifications</HI> of the Sex, as <HI>Opiates</HI>; in&s;omuch, that in dif|ficult Births, they are now the only Re&s;ource of the Midwife Phy&s;icians; and, when joined with <HI>Volatiles,</HI> will bring on the mo&s;t powerful and <HI>vigorous</HI> Throws, in the mo&s;t weak and <HI>lan|gui&s;hing</HI> Con&s;titutions. The&s;e Effects they can produce only by <HI>relaxing</HI> tho&s;e Fibres Pain has <HI>contracted</HI> and render'd unela&s;tick in &s;ome mea&s;ure. 4. No|thing quiets and &s;tops <HI>Cramps, Convul|&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terick</HI> Fits, &s;o &s;uddenly and certainly as <HI>Opiates</HI> do. And every one knows the&s;e ari&s;e from violent Con|tractions, and cri&s;ping up of the mu&s;|cular Fibres. All the&s;e, and many more &s;uch Effects, <HI>Opiates</HI> produce, by <HI>unbending, loo&s;ening,</HI> and <HI>relaxing</HI> tho&s;e Fibres violent and acute Pain had con|&s;tricted and <HI>contracted,</HI> and by giving a Re&s;pite and Reprieve from its Tortures,
<PB N="217" REF="265">
and thereby allowing Nature (the only true Phy&s;ician) to go undi&s;turbed about its own Work. The Way it &s;tops Purging, and cures a <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> I take to be by carrying off the &s;harp and watry Humours in the Bowels by <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> which <HI>Opium</HI> exceedingly promotes; by quieting tho&s;e <HI>Spa&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> and allaying tho&s;e <HI>Stimula|tions</HI> excited by Purging; and &s;ettling and calming the Violence of the <HI>Peri|&s;taltick</HI> Motion of the Guts, which <HI>hurries off</HI> their Contents. I will not take upon me here, to determine the proper Ca&s;es for <HI>Opiates,</HI> or their <HI>Do&s;es.</HI> That is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Phy&s;ician.

If the Ca&s;e is at|tended with <HI>Vomiting,</HI> &s;olid <HI>Opium</HI> will do be&s;t; becau&s;e it will be in a &s;maller Volume, and will not be &s;o readily re|jected.

In the <HI>Stone</HI> it ought to be given with <HI>Oil</HI> of &s;weet <HI>Almonds,</HI> or in &s;ome &s;oft <HI>Emul&s;ion,</HI> to lubricate the Parts.
