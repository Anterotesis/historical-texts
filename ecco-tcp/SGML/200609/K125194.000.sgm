<HEAD>An An&s;wer to a Paper concerning Mr. <HI>De Foe,</HI> again&s;t his Hi&s;tory of the UNION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Herewith &s;end you a Paper full of &s;currilous Reflections, upon Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> and upon his Work, called, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the &V;nion,</HI> pretended to be done in Defence of Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> who, it &s;eems, is thought to be Injur'd in the Account there given of the Tumult at <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>I am very &s;orry to find a Stranger &s;o Treated among us in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, I think, has on many Occa&s;ions in his Writings very well de&s;erved of this Nation: But I am &s;till more concerned, that this Malignity of the Pen &s;hould proceed to &s;uch a &s;currilous Piece, e&s;pecially in pretending to Defend a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, who, if he Retains any of the Temper of his Ma&s;ter, will think him&s;elf very little Obliged to the Per&s;on that has Wrot it, to Defend him in &s;o Rude and Indi&s;creet a manner, as it mu&s;t be owned, becomes no Mode&s;t Man to do.</P>
<P>This Occa&s;ions me to hope, notwith&s;tanding the General Opinion of the People here, that Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> him&s;elf has no hand in it: For fir&s;t, as the Truth of it will want very &s;trong Con|firmation, and is impo&s;&s;ible to be made out, &s;o the Language of it would be more Reflection upon a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, than any thing Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> can have Wrot concerning him.</P>
<P>The Scripture Rule laid down by the Apo&s;tle for a Mini&s;ter is &s;o manife&s;t in this ca&s;e, and &s;o expre&s;ly forbids to return
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<HI>Railing for Railing, and Reviling for Reviling,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> if he &s;ees this Paper, or any Body is &s;o kind to him as to &s;hew it him, can not but clear him&s;elf from being concerned in it, in Honour to his own Reputation; <HI>But this is wor&s;e &s;till,</HI> for to Revile without being Reviled is a part which no Hone&s;t Man will render, much le&s;s a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, Reverend for Learn|ing, Grave in Years, and Sober in Education, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Clark.</HI></P>
<P>But I wave all this, per&s;wading my &s;elf Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> can have no Hand in &s;uch a wretched Piece of Railing and Fal&s;hood, and ha&s;ten to &s;peak in &s;hort to the matter of Fact, which is all that requires an An&s;wer in this Paper, the other being too Gro&s;s to de&s;erve any Notice.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI>'s Work in a Hi&s;tory of the Tran&s;actions of the Union, many People here of the be&s;t Capacity to Judge, have been Witne&s;&s;es to the Preparations he has made for it, and can Te&s;tify for him in his Ab&s;ence, (1.) That he has been very Careful, has taken a great deal of Pains, and been at a great Expence to perform the Promi&s;e made in the Introduction, and which this Per&s;on Quotes, <HI>viz.</HI> to Write with Impartiality and Truth.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That he being gone away for <HI>England,</HI> left the Sheets behind him to the In&s;pection of Per&s;ons in our own Countrey, of Unbya&s;s't Principles, and Un&s;potted Reputation; to who&s;e Revi&s;ing and Correction he &s;ubmitted every thing he had Wrot, and therefore it can not be Sugge&s;ted that he has de&s;ignedly made any Errors to make up Hi&s;tory, or Printed any thing that Merits this Authors hard Words, &mdash; but on the contrary, while Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> has Undertaken the Writing an Impartial Hi&s;tory of Fact, he could not be &s;o weak as to think, that tho&s;e People, who perhaps acted a part in that Affair, which they may have Rea&s;on &s;ince not to be plea&s;ed with in them&s;elves, &s;hould be plea&s;ed with his relating it, however Impartially: And therefore I doubt not he Expected all the ill U&s;age he finds from Per&s;ons who&s;e Actions will not bear a clear Repre&s;entation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">
As to the Errors, I am &s;orry the Author that pretends to be Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s Defender, can find out &s;o few real ones, that he is fain to &s;peak what is &s;o far from being to be Ju&s;tified, that I dare &s;ay Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> will not owne it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, can not be Guilty of &s;o much Prevarication as to &s;ay him&s;elf that he did not &s;peak the Words Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> has Quoted, and I make no &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ure the World, that he did &s;peak the very Words, <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> without Va|riation of the Sen&s;e: And there are &s;o many living Witne&s;&s;es now in the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and &s;ome of them here in this City at this time, who heard the Words &s;poken, that it is &s;omething which few People can Under&s;tand mu&s;t move this Author to deny that for him, which &s;o many People know is matter of Fact, and is &s;o ea&s;y to be Proved.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Gentleman who Wrot this &s;currilous Paper is de&s;ired to Reflect a little, and go and ask Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> about it; I dare &s;ay that Reverend Per&s;on is a Man of too much Con&s;cience and Hone&s;ty not to Acknowledge the Words, and if his Memory &s;hould fail him &s;o much, as not to Remember the Words, he will, no doubt, Refer to his Notes, and find it there ju&s;t as is related, or with very little Difference, <HI>viz. Addre&s;&s;es will not do, and Prayers will not do, there mu&s;t be other Methods, it is true, Prayer is a Duty, but we must not re&s;t there,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Wherefore up, and be Valiant for the City of our GOD.</HI> And that the Reader may not depend upon the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of this Paper, I may refer him to &s;ome of the Chief Inhabitants of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> many of whom were then in the Church, and will, I make no Que&s;tion, be &s;uch Friends to Truth, and to the Stranger that is Abu&s;ed, as to make it out.</P>
<P>Further, if the Author of this Paper now meant, can Engage Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> to bring this matter before the A&s;&s;embly which is now Sitting, as a Charge of Slander by Mr. <HI>De Foe,</HI> I do Promi&s;e in his Ab&s;ence to bring unque&s;tioned Witne&s;&s;es before the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly to prove the &s;aid Words upon him, and till he does &s;o, Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> can not be Charged with Slandering him.</P>
<P>It is plain al&s;o, the Paper it &s;elf acknowledges <HI>the Fact,</HI> tho he Couches it, as if he were a&s;ham'd of it, <HI>&s;aying, that</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Cited <HI>1 Chron.</HI> 22. 16. <HI>2 Sam.</HI> 10. 12. but does not think fit to put down the Words of the &s;aid Texts, which are as follows, <HI>Ari&s;e therefore and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</HI>&mdash;And&mdash;<HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God: and the LORD do that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI> Indeed he was right crafty to hide the&s;e Words.</P>
<P>For, had Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> &s;aid no more than this, it had an&s;wered all Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> alleages, which he al&s;o expre&s;&s;es with as much Tenderne&s;s to Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> as could be, <HI>viz. That this was Con&s;tructed by the Rabble to excite them to Tumults,</HI> &mdash; and who could &s;ay le&s;s? or what could that People think who were before Irritated about their Addre&s;&s;es, being refu&s;ed, but that when he &s;aid, <HI>ARISE AND BE DOING, be of good Courage, and play the Men,</HI> and at la&s;t, <HI>&V;p, and be Valiant,</HI> but that he meant they &s;hould take Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in Order to do Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> &s;ome Ju&s;tice in this, I mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily ob&s;erve, How odd it is for this Author to publi&s;h this Scurrilous Pamphlet, (1) on a Man that he knows to be ab&s;ent, and not able to reply to him. (2) Again&s;t a Book that is not yet publi&s;hed, that &s;o the People being ignorant of the manner of expre&s;&s;ing it, may believe all he &s;ays; &mdash; and by what clande&s;tine way he has come to the &s;ight of the imper|fect Sheets, I dare &s;ay he will be a&s;hamed to owne.</P>
<P>However, as I think Mr. <HI>De Foe,</HI> as a Hi&s;torian, could not have been faithful to the Matter of Fact, no nor to the Magi|&s;trates and good People of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who were then mi&s;repre&s;en|ted to the whole I&s;land, <HI>nay to their Sovereign too,</HI> and lay under the Scandal of a Factious Mutinous People, without relating the Steps by which that Tumult grew up, as the hone&s;te&s;t way to Vindicate them; &mdash; So I think he has been &s;o far from re|proaching or abu&s;ing Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> that he took all the Precautions po&s;&s;ible to prevent his Readers &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> did it in De&s;ign.</P>
<P>As to what Connexion of Circum&s;tances there might be to render his De&s;ign &s;u&s;pected to others, Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> u&s;es him mo&s;t di&s;creetly; And if in one Line he calls him a Weak Good Man, which is the utmo&s;t they can pretend, I forbear for his own &s;ake to enter into an Enquiry here, whether it were a Weakne&s;s
<PB N="5" REF="5">
in him, <HI>AT THAT TIME,</HI> to u&s;e &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions or no, re|ferring it to them who know what Influence his Words, <HI>however well and innocently de&s;ign'd,</HI> had upon the People, and how, within one Hour after they were &s;poken, the whole City was in an Uproar and Confu&s;ion: I am &s;ure it is a Weakne&s;s in any of his Friends, to bring him thus on the Stage again at &s;uch a time as this e&s;pecially. <HI>Let them con&s;ider of that as they like.</HI></P>
<P>But that you may not take my Word for Mr. <HI>De Foes</HI> di&s;creet U&s;age of him, I &s;hall quote the Words in his Hi&s;tory as he has printed this Ca&s;e, and let any Man judge, if he has u&s;ed the Reverend Mini&s;ter ill or no. His Words are thus, <HI>P.</HI> 60. and which, if fairly quoted, his Paper would have an&s;wer'd it &s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the <GAP DESC="blank"> day of <GAP DESC="blank"> the Fa&s;t appointed by the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly was kept in <HI>Gla&s;|gow,</HI> Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">k</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in <HI>Ezra</HI> 8. 21. <HI>And I proclaimed a Fa&s;t at the River of</HI> AHAVA, <HI>that we might afflict our &s;elves before our GOD, to &s;eek of Him a right Way for us, and for our little Ones, and for all our Sub&s;tance.</HI>'</P>
<P>'I &s;hall convince the Gentleman concerned, that this Account is not made for a Satyr upon him, 'tis too &s;erious a Subject; and when both he, and tho&s;e who heard him, reflects on, how much more his Unhappy Temper, at that time, forc'd from him, than I &s;et down here, all which I have by me <HI>verbatim,</HI> as he &s;poke it, he will, I &s;ay, be convinced, that I talk no more, than, in the Obligation of a Hi&s;torian to Truth of Fact, I am bound to do.'</P>
<P>'I am not at all apprehen&s;ive of having the Truth of the&s;e Words que&s;tioned, having received them from the Mouths of more than two or three of the principal Inhabitants of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who heard them &s;poken; and if the mi&s;placing a Word &s;hould be &s;natcht at, <HI>I venture to &s;ay,</HI> that this was the full Purport of the Expre&s;&s;i|on, without the lea&s;t Variation; as to the Weak Good Man that &s;poke them, I will not &s;ugge&s;t, that he fore&s;aw the Con&s;equence of them, or had any &s;uch thing in his De&s;ign, tho it calls for &s;ome Charity to gue&s;s his Meaning; The kinde&s;t thing I can &s;ay of them, is that he did not mean at all what followed, but &s;poke in his Ha&s;te; for God forbid I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t he mean'd to rai&s;e a Rebellion, and to bring his Country into all that Blood and Con|fu&s;ion,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
which, if GODs Goodne&s;s had not prevented it, had certainly followed.'</P>
<P>'The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock, and the People were &s;o Enflamed before, that, by one of the Clock, the Mob were gotten together, their Drum was Beat in the Back &s;treets, and all the Confu&s;ions we are now to &s;peak of followed.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far the Hi&s;tory &s;peaks, and here any Man may &s;ee how Di&s;creetly Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> has u&s;ed Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> how he has Declared over and over that he does no way Charge his De&s;ign &mdash; <HI>And that is more than all the People of</HI> Gla&s;gow <HI>will do, tho' they have as much Re&s;pect for their Mini&s;ters as other People.</HI> Nay, he En|deavours to clear him <HI>&s;o much as</HI> of fore&s;eeing the Con&s;equence, and in that gives him the Stile of <HI>Weak Good Man</HI>; if this Au|thor will not have him to be a Good Man, <HI>that is none of Mr.</HI> De Foe<HI>'s fault,</HI> and if he will not own his Weakne&s;s in ill Timeing that Di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> is very little oblig'd to him: For it certainly mu&s;t be Owned as a Weakne&s;s, or Ju&s;tified as a De&s;ign, and let him take it which way he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>There is a &s;eeming Error indeed, in Printing the Word <HI>Of</HI> for <HI>After</HI>: But Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> is cleared of this Effectually, for that he left a Blank for the Day of the Month, to be filled up at the Pre&s;s, which they have &s;till left open, and his Original Copy being here in Town to refer to, &mdash; makes it out; The <HI>Errata</HI> al&s;o at the Revi&s;ing of the Sheets &s;upply it all, which this Accu&s;er, it &s;eems has not &s;een, but &s;peaks without Book.</P>
<P>For the Words being Read either way are Right, even by his own Charge, &mdash; thus,</P>
<Q>(Fir&s;t) For, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Day of the Fa&s;t. Read, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Day after the Fa&s;t.</Q>
<P N="2">(2.) Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> knew as well as the &s;currilous Author the Fa&s;t was on a <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and therefore Printed the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> which was the Day of the Sermon, and cannot fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean the Fa&s;t Day, and &s;o &s;econdly, the Blank being filled up, it will be right another way thus:</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="7">
On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 7 of <HI>November, the day after the Fa&s;t.</HI></Q>
<P>Who would believe &s;uch a &s;hift as this &s;hould be made u&s;e of, as a Refuge to protect the re&s;t of the Allegations: It is the matter of Fact, not the Day of the Month that is material, and that is but foully wiped off indeed.</P>
<P>As to Per&s;ons dealing with the Provo&s;t of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> before this Sermon about Addre&s;&s;ing, which he calls a fourth Error; The Provo&s;t is a Man of too much Candor to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Sug|ge&s;tions, and it is Referred to him to Determine whether it be Truth or no, let them Enquire at the Peril of their Credit.</P>
<P>The third Charge is a full Te&s;t of the Hone&s;ty of this Author, and may direct any Hone&s;t Man to make a Judgment of him.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 1. <HI>Par.</HI> 4. he &s;ays,</P>
<P>His <HI>(De Foe</HI>'s) third Error is P. 60. <HI>That about one of the Clock after Sermon ON THE FAST DAY, the Mob got together and Beat up the Drums.</HI></P>
<P>This cannot be Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> he has more Hone&s;ty, he would not have &s;poken &s;o without Book, he dar'd not to impo&s;e &s;uch abo|minable Fal&s;ity on the World, <HI>at lea&s;t I hope &s;o</HI>; &mdash; for, in Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI>'s Book, <HI>the Sheet lying now before me,</HI> and as quoted above, it is nothing &s;o: The Words are thus,</P>
<P><HI>Sermon being ended about eleven of the Clock, &mdash; by one of the Clock the Mob were gotten together, their Drum was Beat,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; and this is true.</P>
<P>Let any Man judge of the re&s;t of this Sheet by this <HI>Specimen,</HI> &mdash; and therefore I think this may &s;erve for a full An&s;wer to his mighty <HI>Book of Errors,</HI> for &s;uch indeed it may be ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of his Paper is filled with Fire and Brim&s;tone, Abu&s;ing the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and Railing at Mr. <HI>De Foe,</HI> who, if he was here, perhaps might &s;peak for him&s;elf: But this I mu&s;t &s;ay for him, That whereas he pretends to Charge him with Reproaching a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel;</P>
<P>If the Author of that Paper had read out that part of the Hi|&s;tory of the Union, which Treats of the Management of the Mi|ni&s;ters of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he will find Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> has done the Mini&s;ters
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y">
in general &s;o much Ju&s;tice, and their Characters &s;o much Honour in that Book, as well as on all Occa&s;ions in his other Writings, as will &s;ufficiently Evidence him to be both a Reverencer of their Office, a Lover of their Per&s;ons, and a Friend to their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>As to his Reflections on the Hi&s;tory it &s;elf in general, which he &s;trives to Di&s;parage, tho' he has not &s;een it, he is referr'd to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who, Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> can tell him, ranks them among his Fools, who judge of a Matter before they hear it: &mdash; His Mo|tion to have the Government &s;uppre&s;s it, &s;hows his Good Will to Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> on one hand, and which, if he were here, no Que&s;tion he would Laugh at &s;ufficiently; but, on the other, is a Satyr on his Friend Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> as if he were a&s;hamed his Acti|ons on that Occa&s;ion &s;hould come to the View of the World.</P>
<P>And indeed Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> I think, will have little Rea&s;on to Thank him for what he has done in this Ca&s;e; for that I &s;hall take effectual Care, in the Vindication of Truth, to have a more particular Account of that whole Ca&s;e put into this Hi&s;tory, this Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd, wherein the Accu&s;er may have further Occa&s;ion of Vindicating &s;ome Body, who is generally thought to have had but bad Luck formerly at Vindicating him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the Rude and Indi&s;creet Language given him in the Paper, as it ju&s;tly offends the Ears of the Hearers, and fouls the Mouth of the Reader; &s;o I &s;hall ob&s;erve the Method Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> him&s;elf takes in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> Take no notice of it, it is not worth while, it hurts the Author, not Mr. <HI>De Foe</HI> in the lea&s;t, only this I mu&s;t &s;ay as my own Ob&s;ervation in all Matters of Debate.</P>
<Q>Wi&s;e Men Argue, and Fools Rail.</Q>
