<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND D^R YOUNG, RECTOR of WELWYN In HERTFORDSHIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER> 
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to break into your retirement, the re&s;idence of virtue and literature, and to trouble you with a few reflections on the merits and real character of an admired author, and on other collateral &s;ubjects, that will naturally ari&s;e. No love of &s;ingularity, no affectation of paradoxical opinions, gave ri&s;e to the following work. I re|vere the memory of POPE, I re&s;pect and honour his abilities; but I do not think him at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion. In other words, in that &s;pecies of poetry wherein POPE excelled, he is &s;uperior
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to all mankind: and I only &s;ay, that this &s;pecies of poetry is not the mo&s;t excel|lent one of the art. We do not, it &s;hould &s;eem, &s;ufficiently attend to the difference there is, betwixt a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF SENSE, and a TRUE POET. Donne and Swift, were un|doubtedly men of wit, and men of &s;en&s;e: but what traces have they left of PURE POETRY? Fontenelle and La Motte are entitled to the former character; but what can they urge to gain the latter? Which of the&s;e characters is the mo&s;t valuable and u&s;eful, is entirely out of the que&s;tion: all I plead for, is, to have their &s;everal provinces kept di&s;tinct from each other; and to impre&s;s on the rea|der, that a clear head, and acute under|&s;tanding are not &s;ufficient, alone, to
<PB N="v" REF="4">
make a POET; that the mo&s;t &s;olid ob&s;er|vations on human life, expre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t elegance and brevity, are MORALITY, and not POETRY; that the EPISTLES of Boileau in RHYME, are no more poetical, than the CHARACTERS of Bruyere in PROSE; and that it is a creative and glowing IMAGINATION, <Q REND="inline">"acer &s;piritus ac vis,"</Q> and that alone, that can &s;tamp a writer with this exalted and very uncommon character, which &s;o few po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of which &s;o few can pro|perly judge.</P>
<P>FOR one per&s;on, who can adequately reli&s;h, and enjoy, a work of imagination, twenty are to be found who can ta&s;te and judge of, ob&s;ervations on familiar life, and the manners of the age. The
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
&s;atires of Ario&s;to, are more read than the Orlando Furio&s;o, or even Dante. Are there &s;o many cordial admirers of Spen&s;er and Milton, as of Hudibras?&mdash;If we &s;trike out of the number of the&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed admirers, tho&s;e who appear &s;uch out of fa&s;hion, and not of feeling. Swift's rhap&s;ody on poetry is far more popular, than Aken&s;ide's noble ode to Lord Huntingdon. The EPISTLES on the Cha|racters of men and women, and your &s;prightly &s;atires, my good friend, are more frequently peru&s;ed, and quoted, than L'Allegro and Il Pen&s;ero&s;o of Milton. Had you written only the&s;e &s;atires, you would indeed have gained the title of a man of wit, and a man of &s;en&s;e; but, I am confident, would not in&s;i&s;t on being denominated a POET, MERELY on their account.<Q><PB N="vii" REF="6">
<L>NON SATIS EST PURIS VERSUM PERSCRIBERE VERBIS.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is amazing this matter &s;hould ever have been mi&s;taken, when Horace has taken particular and repeated pains, to &s;ettle and adju&s;t the opinion in que&s;tion. He has more than once di&s;claimed all right and title to the name of POET, on the &s;core of his ethic and &s;atiric pieces.
<Q><L>&mdash;NEQUE ENIM CONCLUDERE VERSUM</L>
<L>DIXERIS ESSE SATIS&mdash;</L></Q>
are lines, often repeated, but who&s;e mean|ing is not extended and weighed as it ought to be. Nothing can be more judicious than the method he pre&s;cribes, of trying whether any compo&s;ition be e&s;&s;entially poetical or not; which is, to drop entirely the mea&s;ures and numbers, and tran&s;po&s;e and invert the order of the
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
words: and in this unadorned manner to peru&s;e the pa&s;&s;age. If there be really in it a true poetical &s;pirit, all your inver|&s;ions and tran&s;po&s;itions will not di&s;gui&s;e and extingui&s;h it; but it will retain its lu&s;tre, like a diamond, un&s;et, and thrown back into the rubbi&s;h of the mine. Let us make a little experiment on the fol|lowing well-known lines; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Yes, you de&s;pi&s;e the man that is confined to books, who rails at human kind from his &s;tudy; tho' what he learns, he &s;peaks; and may perhaps advance &s;ome general maxims, or may be right by chance. The coxcomb bird, &s;o grave and &s;o talk|ative, that cries whore, knave, and cuckold, from his cage, tho' he rightly call many a pa&s;&s;enger, you hold him no philo&s;opher. And yet, &s;uch is the fate</HI>
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
<HI>of all extremes, men may be read too much, as well as books. We grow more partial, for the &s;ake of the ob&s;erver, to ob&s;ervations which we our&s;elves make; le&s;s, &s;o, to written wi&s;dom, becau&s;e another's. Maxims are drawn from no|tions, and tho&s;e from gue&s;s.</HI>"</Q> What &s;hall we &s;ay of this pa&s;&s;age?&mdash;Why, that it is mo&s;t excellent &s;en&s;e, but ju&s;t as poetical as the <Q REND="inline">"Qui fit Maecenas"</Q> of the author who recom|mends this method of trial. Take any ten lines of the Iliad, Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, or even of the Georgics of Virgil, and &s;ee whe|ther by any proce&s;s of critical chymi&s;try, you can lower and reduce them to the tamene&s;s of pro&s;e. You will find that they will appear like Uly&s;&s;es in his di&s;|gui&s;e
<PB N="x" REF="9">
of rags, &s;till a hero, tho' lodged in the cottage of the herd&s;man Eumaeus.</P>
<P>THE Sublime and the Pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine poe&s;y. What is there very &s;ublime or very Pathetic in POPE? In his works there is indeed, <Q REND="inline">"nihil inane, nihil arce&s;&s;itum;&mdash;puro tamen fonti quam magno flumini propior;"</Q> as the excellent Quintilian remarks of Ly&s;ias. And becau&s;e I am perhaps a&s;hamed or afraid to &s;peak out in plain Engli&s;h, I will adopt the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age of Voltaire, which, in my opinion, as exactly characterizes POPE, as it does his model Boileau, for whom it was originally de&s;igned. <Q REND="inline">"INCAPABLE PEUTETRE DU SUBLIME QUI ELEVE L'AME, ET DU SENTIMENT QUI L'ATTENDRIT, MAIS FAIT POUR ECLAIRER CEUX A QUI LA NATURE ACCORDA L'UN
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
ET L'AUTRE, LABORIEUX, SEVERE, PRECIS, PUR, HARMONIEUX, IL DEVINT, ENFIN, LE POETE DE LA RAISON."</Q></P>
<P>OUR Engli&s;h poets may, I think, be be di&s;po&s;ed in four different cla&s;&s;es and degrees. In the fir&s;t cla&s;s, I would place, fir&s;t, our only three &s;ublime and pathetic poets; SPENSER, SHAKESPEARE, MILTON; and then, at proper intervals, OTWAY and LEE. In the &s;econd cla&s;s &s;hould be placed, &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the true poetical genius, in a more moderate de|gree, but had noble talents for moral and ethical poe&s;y. At the head of the&s;e are DRYDEN, DONNE, DENHAM, COWLEY, CONGREVE. In the third cla&s;s may be placed, men of wit, of elegant ta&s;te, and &s;ome fancy in de&s;cribing familiar life. Here may be numbered, PRIOR,
<PB N="xii" REF="11" MS="y">
WALLER, PARNELL, SWIFT, FENTON. In the fourth cla&s;s, the mere ver&s;ifiers, however &s;mooth and mellifluous &s;ome of them may be thought, &s;hould be ranked. Such as PITT, SANDYS, FAIR|FAX, BROOME, BUCKINGHAM, LANS|DOWN. In which of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es POPE de&s;erves to be placed, the following work is intended to determine.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the PASTORALS, and the MESSIAH an Eclogue.</HEAD>
<P>PRINCES and Authors are &s;eldom &s;poken of, during their lives, with ju&s;|tice and impartiality. Admiration and envy, their con&s;tant attendants, like two un&s;kilful arti&s;ts, are apt to overcharge their pieces with too great a quantity of light or of &s;hade; and are di&s;qualified happily to hit upon that middle colour, that mixture of
<PB N="2" REF="13">
error and excellence, which alone renders every repre&s;entation of man ju&s;t and natural. This perhaps may be one rea&s;on, among o|thers, why we have never yet &s;een a fair and candid critici&s;m on the character and merits of our la&s;t great poet, Mr. POPE. I have therefore thought, that it would be no unplea&s;ing amu&s;ement, or unin&s;tructive employment to examine at large, without blind panegyric, or petulant invective, the writings of this Engli&s;h Cla&s;&s;ic, in the order in which they are arranged in the elegant edition of Mr. Warburton. As I &s;hall nei|ther cen&s;ure nor commend, without alleging the rea&s;on on which my opinion is founded, I &s;hall be entirely unmoved at the impu|tation of malignity, or the clamours of po|pular prejudice.</P>
<P>IT is &s;omething &s;trange, that in the pa&s;|torals of a young poet there &s;hould not be found a &s;ingle rural image that is new: but this I am afraid is the ca&s;e in the PASTORALS before us. The ideas of Theocritus, Vir|gil,
<PB N="3" REF="14">
and Spen&s;er, are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure; but the de&s;criptions and &s;entiments are trite and common. That the de&s;ign of pa&s;toral poe&s;y is, to repre&s;ent the undi&s;turbed felicity of the golden age, is an empty notion, which, though &s;upported by a Rapin and a Fonte|nelle, I think, all rational critics have agreed to ex&s;tirpate and explode. But I do not re|member, that even the&s;e la&s;t-mentioned cri|tics have remarked the circum&s;tance that gave origin to the opinion that any golden age was intended. Theocritus, the father and the model of this enchanting &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, lived and wrote in Sicily. The climate of Sicily was delicious, and the face of the country various, and beautiful: it's vallies and it's precipices, it's grot|tos and ca&s;cades were SWEETLY INTER|CHANGED, and it's fruits and flowers were lavi&s;h and lu&s;cious. The poet de&s;cribed what he &s;aw and felt: and had no need to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e artificial a&s;&s;emblages of plea&s;ing objects, which are not to be found
<PB N="4" REF="15">
in nature. The figs and the honey which he a&s;&s;igns as a reward to a victorious &s;hep|herd were in them&s;elves exqui&s;ite, and are therefore a&s;&s;igned with great propriety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idyll. i. ver. 146.</NOTE>: and the beauties of that luxurious land|&s;chape &s;o richly and circum&s;tantially deline|ated in the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh idyllium, where all things &s;melt of &s;ummer and &s;melt of autumn,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 133.</NOTE></L></Q>
were pre&s;ent and real. Succeeding writers &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e beauties too great and a|bundant to be real, referred them to the fictitious and imaginary &s;cenes of a golden age.</P>
<P>A MIXTURE of Briti&s;h and Grecian ideas may ju&s;tly be deemed a blemi&s;h in the PAS|TORALS of POPE: and propriety is certainly violated, when he couples Pactolus with Thames, and Wind&s;or with Hybla. Com|plaints of IMMODERATE heat, and wi&s;hes to be conveyed to cooling caverns, when uttered
<PB N="5" REF="16">
by the inhabitants of Greece, have a deco|rum and con&s;i&s;tency, which they totally lo&s;e in the character of a Briti&s;h &s;hepherd: and Theocritus, during the ardors of Sirius, mu&s;t have heard the murmurings of a brook, and the whi&s;pers of a pine, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idyll. i. ver. 1.</NOTE> with more home|felt plea&s;ure, than Pope <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;t. iv. ver. 1.</NOTE> could po&s;&s;ibly ex|perience upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion. We can never completely reli&s;h, or adequately under|&s;tand any author, e&s;pecially any Ancient, ex|cept we con&s;tantly keep in our eye his cli|mate, his country, and his age. POPE him|&s;elf informs us, in a note, that he judiciou&s;ly omitted the following ver&s;e,
<Q><L>And li&s;t'ning wolves grow milder as they hear <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;t. ii.</NOTE></L></Q>
on account of the ab&s;urdity, which Spen&s;er overlooked, of introducing wolves into Eng|land. But on this principle, which is cer|tainly a ju&s;t one, may it not be a&s;ked, why he &s;hould &s;peak, the &s;cene lying in Wind&s;or-

That POPE however was &s;en&s;ible of the importance of adapting images to the &s;cene of action, is obvious from the following example of his judgment; for in tran&s;lating,
<Q><L>Audiit EUROTAS, ju&s;&s;itque edi&s;cere LAUROS</L></Q>
he has dextrou&s;ly dropt the <HI>laurels</HI> appropri|ated to Eurotas, as he is &s;peaking of the river Thames, and has rendered it,

<P>IN the pa&s;&s;ages which POPE has imitated from Theocritus, and from his Latin tran|&s;lator Virgil, he has merited but little ap|plau&s;e. It may not be unentertaining to &s;ee
<PB N="7" REF="18">
how coldly and unpoetically POPE has copied the &s;ub&s;equent appeal to the nymphs on the death of Daphnis, in compari&s;on of Milton on LYCIDAS, one of his juvenile pieces.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></L>

<P>THAT POPE has not equalled Theocritus, will indeed appear le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, if we re|flect, that no original writer ever remained &s;o unrivalled by &s;ucceeding copyi&s;ts, as this Sici|lian ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be objected, that the barren|ne&s;s of invention imputed to POPE from a view of his PASTORALS, is equally imputable to the Bucolics of Virgil, it may be an&s;wered, that whatever may be determined of the re&s;t, yet the fir&s;t and la&s;t Eclogues of Virgil are indi&s;putable proofs of true genius, and power of fancy. The influence of war on the tran|quillity of rural life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> I have been lately highly entertained with the accidental peru&s;al of FIVE PASTORALS, written on this plan, de&s;criptive of the calamities &s;uppo&s;ed to have been felt by the &s;hepherds of Germany during the la&s;t war: They abound in many new circum&s;tances of pa&s;toral di&s;tre&s;s, and many tender images. I cannot learn the name of the author.</NOTE>, rendered the &s;ubject
<PB N="10" REF="21">
of the fir&s;t new, and intere&s;ting: its compo|&s;ition is truly dramatic; and the characters of it's two &s;hepherds are well &s;upported, and happily contra&s;ted: and the la&s;t has expre&s;|&s;ively painted the changeful re&s;olutions, the wild wi&s;hes, the pa&s;&s;ionate and abrupt ex|clamations, of a di&s;appointed and de&s;pairing lover.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the principal merit of the PASTORALS of POPE con&s;i&s;ts, in their cor|rect and mu&s;ical ver&s;ification; mu&s;ical, to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable: and in giving the fir&s;t &s;pe|cimen of that harmony in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, which is now become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and which has &s;o forcibly and univer&s;ally in|fluenced the publick ear, as to have rendered every moderate rhymer melodious. POPE lengthened the abruptne&s;s of Waller, and at the &s;ame time contracted the exuberance of Dryden.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22">
I REMEMBER to have been informed, by an intimate friend of POPE, that he had once laid a de&s;ign of writing AMERICAN ECLOGUES: The &s;ubject would have been fruitful of the mo&s;t poetical imagery; and, if properly executed, would have re&s;cued the author from the accu&s;ation here urged, of having written Eclogues without invention.</P>
<P>OUR author, who had received an early tincture of religion, a reverence for which he pre&s;erved to the la&s;t, was with ju&s;tice con|vinced, that the &s;criptures of God contained not only the pure&s;t precepts of morality, but the mo&s;t elevated and &s;ublime &s;trokes of ge|nuine poe&s;y; &s;trokes as much &s;uperior to any thing Heatheni&s;m can produce, as is Jehovah to Jupiter. This is the ca&s;e more particularly in the exalted prophe&s;y of I&s;aiah, which POPE has &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully ver&s;ified in an Ec|logue, that inconte&s;tably &s;urpa&s;&s;es the Pollio of Virgil: although perhaps the dignity, the energy, and the &s;implicity of the original are
<PB N="12" REF="23">
in a few pa&s;&s;ages weakened and dimini&s;hed by florid epithets, and u&s;ele&s;s circumlocutions.
<Q><L>See nature ha&s;tes her earlie&s;t wreaths to bring,</L>
<L>With all the incen&s;e of the breathing &s;pring. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MESS. v. 23.</NOTE></L></Q>
are lines which have too much prettine&s;s, and too modern an air. The judicious addi|tion of circum&s;tances and adjuncts is what renders poe&s;y a more lively imitation of nature than pro&s;e. POPE has been happy in introducing the following circum&s;tance: the prophet &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The parched ground &s;hall become a pool;"</Q> Our author ex|pre&s;&s;es this idea by &s;aying, that the &s;hepherd,

<L>New falls of water murmuring in his ear. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">v. 70.</NOTE></L></Q>
A &s;triking example of a &s;imilar beauty may be added from Thomp&s;on. Meli&s;ander, in the Tragedy of AGAMEMNON, after telling us he was conveyed in a ve&s;&s;el, at mid-night, to the wilde&s;t of the Cyclades, adds, when the pitile&s;s mariners had left him in that dread|ful &s;olitude,
<Q><PB N="13" REF="24">
<L>&mdash;I never heard</L>
<L>A &s;ound &s;o di&s;mal as their parting oars.</L></Q></P>
<P>ON the other hand, the prophet has been &s;ometimes particular, when POPE has been only general. <Q REND="inline">"Lift up thine eyes round about, and &s;ee; all they gather them&s;elves together, they come to thee:&mdash;The multitude of CAMELS &s;hall cover thee: the DROMEDARIES of Median and Ephah: all they from Sheba &s;hall come: they &s;hall bring gold and incen&s;e, and they &s;hall &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of the Lord.

<P>AS pro&s;perity and happine&s;s are de&s;cribed in this Eclogue by a combination of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and agreeable objects, &s;o mi&s;ery and de&s;truction are as forcibly delineated in the &s;ame I&s;aiah, by the circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;olation, that were to attend the fall of that magnificent city, Babylon: and the latter is perhaps a more proper and intere&s;ting &s;ubject for poetry than the former; as &s;uch kinds of objects make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the mind: pity being a &s;tronger &s;en&s;ation than complacency. Accordingly a noble ode on the de&s;truction of Babylon, taken from the fourteenth chapter of I&s;aiah, has been written by Mr. Lowth, who&s;e latin prelec|tions on the inimitable poe&s;y of the Hebrews, abounding in remarks entirely new, deli|vered in the pure&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive lan|guage, are the riche&s;t augmentation literature

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"THE prophet having predicted the deli|verance of the Jews, and their return into their own country from their rigorous Baby|loni&s;h captivity, in&s;tantly introduces them &s;inging a certain triumphal &s;ong on the fall of the king of Babylon; a &s;ong abounding in the mo&s;t &s;plendid images, and carried on by perpetual, and tho&s;e very beautiful, per|&s;onifications. The &s;ong begins with a &s;udden exclamation of the Jews, expre&s;&s;ing their joy and wonder at the unexpected change of their condition, and death of the tyrant. Earth with her inhabitants triumphs; the firs and cedars of Libanus, under which images the allegoric &s;tyle frequently &s;hadows the kings and princes of the Gentiles, rejoice, and in|&s;ult with reproaches the broken power of their mo&s;t implacable foe.<Q><PB N="16" REF="27">
<L>She is at re&s;t, the whole earth is quiet: they break forth into
&s;inging.</L>
<L>Even the firs rejoice at thee, the cedars of Libanus:</L>
<L>Since thou art laid low, no feller is come up again&s;t us.</L></Q> There follows a mo&s;t daring pro&s;opopeia of ORCUS, or the infernal regions: he rouzes his inhabitants, the manes of princes, and the &s;hades of departed kings: immediately all of them ari&s;e from their thrones, and walk forward to meet the king of Babylon; they in&s;ult and deride him, and gather con|&s;olation from his calamity.<Q><L>Art thou al&s;o made weak as we? art thou made like unto us?</L>
<L>Is thy pride da&s;hed down to Orcus, the noi&s;e of thy harps?</L>
<L>The worm is &s;trewn under thee, the earth-worm is thy covering!</L></Q> The Jews are again repre&s;ented &s;peaking: they mo&s;t &s;trongly exaggerate his remarkable fall, by an exclamation formed in the manner of funeral lamentations:<Q><L>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, &s;on of the morning!</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="28"> Thou art da&s;hed down to the earth, thou that did&s;t
cru&s;h the nations!</L></Q> They next repre&s;ent the king him&s;elf &s;peaking, and madly boa&s;ting of his unbounded power, whence the prodigiou&s;ne&s;s of his ruin is won|derfully aggravated. Nor is this enough; a new per&s;onage is immediately formed: Tho&s;e are introduced who found the body of the king of Babylon ca&s;t out: they &s;urvey it it clo&s;ely and attentively, and at la&s;t hardly know it.
<Q><L>Is this the man who made earth tremble, who &s;hook the kingdoms?</L>
<L>Who made the world a &s;olitude, and de&s;troyed it's cities?</L></Q>
They reproach him with the lo&s;s of the com|mon rite of &s;epulture, which was de&s;ervedly denied to him for his cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, and cur&s;e his name, his race, and po&s;terity. The &s;cene is clo&s;ed by a mo&s;t awful &s;peech of God him&s;elf, menacing a perpetual extir|pation to the king of Babylon, to his de|&s;cendants, and to his city; and confirm|ing
<PB N="18" REF="29">
the immutability of his councils by the ratification of a &s;olemn oath.</P> 
<P>WHAT images, how various, how thick|&s;own, how &s;ublime, exalted with what ener|gy, what expre&s;&s;ions, figures, and &s;entiments, are here accumulated together! we hear the Jews, the cedars of Libanus, the &s;hades of the departed kings, the king of Babylon, tho&s;e who find his body, and la&s;tly Jehovah him&s;elf, all &s;peaking in order; and behold them acting their &s;everal parts, as it were in a drama. One continued action is carried on; or rather a various and manifold &s;eries of dif|ferent actions is connected. Every excellence, more peculiarly appropriated to the &s;ublimer ode, is con&s;ummatley di&s;played in this poem of I&s;aiah, which is the mo&s;t perfect and unex|ampled model, among all the monuments of antiquity. The per&s;onages are frequent, but not confu&s;ed; are bold but not affected; a free, lofty, and truly divine &s;pirit predomi|nates through the whole. Nor is any thing wanting to crown and complete the &s;ublimity

<P>IT cannot be thought &s;trange, that he who could &s;o judiciou&s;ly explain, could as poetically expre&s;s, the ideas of I&s;aiah: the latter he has performed in many in&s;tances; but in none more &s;trikingly than in the fol|lowing, which magnificently repre&s;ents the Me&s;&s;iah treading the wine-pre&s;s in his anger, and which and impartial judge, not blinded by the charms of antiquity, will think equal to any de&s;cription in Virgil, in point of ele|gance and energy:<Q><L>&mdash;Ille patris vires indutus et iram</L>

<P>A PERSON of no &s;mall rank has informed me, that Mr. Addi&s;on was inexpre&s;&s;ibly cha|grined at this noble conclu&s;ion of WINDSOR-FOREST, both as a politician and as a poet.

<P>IT is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ing arts of de&s;criptive poetry, to introduce moral &s;entences and in&s;tructions in an oblique and indirect manner, in places where one natu|rally expects only painting and amu&s;ement.

compo&s;ed turn, and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object. This is the great charm of the in|comparable ELEGY written in a Country Church-Yard.

<P>IT would be unpardonable to conclude the&s;e remarks on de&s;criptive poe&s;y, without taking notice of the SEASONS of Thom&s;on, who had peculiar and powerful talents for
<PB N="42" REF="53">
this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. Let the reader therefore pardon a digre&s;&s;ion, if &s;uch it be, on his merits and character. Thom&s;on was ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong and copious fancy; he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and original images, which he painted from nature it&s;elf, and from his own actual ob&s;er|vations: his de&s;criptions have therefore a di&s;|tinctne&s;s and truth, which are utterly wanting to tho&s;e, of poets who have only copied from each other, and have never looked abroad on the objects them&s;elves. Thom&s;on was accu&s;|tomed to wander away into the country for days and for weeks, attentive to, <Q REND="inline">"each rural &s;ight, each rural &s;ound;"</Q> while many a poet who has dwelt for years in the Strand, has attempted to de&s;cribe fields and rivers, and generally &s;ucceeded accordingly. Hence that nau&s;eous repetition of the &s;ame circum|&s;tances; hence that di&s;gu&s;ting impropriety of introducing what may be called a &s;et of here|ditary images, without proper regard to the age, or climate, or occa&s;ion, in which they were formerly u&s;ed. Though the diction of
<PB N="43" REF="54">
the SEASONS is &s;ometimes har&s;h and inharmo|nious, and &s;ometimes turgid and ob&s;cure, and though in many in&s;tances, the numbers are not &s;ufficiently diver&s;ified by different pau&s;es, yet is this poem on the whole, from the num|berle&s;s &s;trokes of nature in which it abounds, one of the mo&s;t captivating and amu&s;ing in our language, and which, as its beauties are not of a fugacious kind, as depending on par|ticular cu&s;toms and manners, will ever be peru&s;ed with delight. The &s;cenes of Thom|&s;on are frequently as wild and romantic as tho&s;e of Salvator Ro&s;a, plea&s;ingly varied with precipices and torrents, and <Q REND="inline">"ca&s;tled cliffs,"</Q> and deep vallies, with piny mountains, and the gloomie&s;t caverns.

<L>Mu&s;ic can noble <HI>hints</HI> impart.&mdash;</L></Q> There follows in this &s;tanza, which is the third, a de&s;cription of a &s;ubject very trite, Orpheus drawing the bea&s;ts about him. POPE &s;hewed his &s;uperior judgment in taking no notice of this old &s;tory, and &s;electing a more new, as well as more &s;triking incident, in the life of Orpheus. It was the cu&s;tom of this time, for almo&s;t every rhymer to try his hand in an ode on St. Cecilia; we find many de&s;picable rap&s;odies, &s;o called, in Ton&s;on's Mi&s;cellanies. We have therefore al&s;o pre&s;erved another, and an earlier ode, of Dryden on this &s;ubject. One &s;tanza of which I cannot forbear in&s;erting in this note. It was &s;et to mu&s;ic 1687. by I. Bapti&s;ta Dragh. <Q><L>What pa&s;&s;ion cannot mu&s;ic rai&s;e and quell!</L>
<L>When Jubal &s;truck the chorded &s;hell,</L>
<L>His li&s;t'ning brethren &s;tood around,</L>
<L>And wond'ring on their faces fell,</L>
<L>To wor&s;hip that cele&s;tial &s;ound:</L>
<L>Le&s;s than a god they thought there could not dwell,</L>
<L>Within the hollow of that &s;hell,</L>
<L>That &s;poke &s;o &s;weetly and &s;o well.</L>
<L>What pa&s;&s;ion cannot mu&s;ic rai&s;e and quell!</L></Q></P> 
<P>This is &s;o complete and engaging a hi&s;tory-piece, that I knew a per&s;on of ta&s;te who was re&s;olved to have it executed, if an arti&s;t could have been found, on one &s;ide of his &s;alloon. In which ca&s;e, &s;aid he, the painter has nothing to do, but to &s;ub&s;titute colours for words, the de&s;ign being fini&s;hed to his hands. The reader doubtle&s;s ob&s;erves the fine effect of the repetition of the la&s;t line; as well as the &s;troke of nature, in making the&s;e rude hearers imagine &s;ome god lay concealed in this fir&s;t mu&s;ician's in&s;trument.</P></NOTE> 
<Q REND="inline">"propior tamen primo quam <PB N="53" REF="64"> tertio,"</Q> to
u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of Quintilian. The fir&s;t &s;tanza is almo&s;t a
perfect concert of it&s;elf; every different in&s;trument is de&s;cribed 
<PB N="54" REF="65"> and illu&s;trated, in numbers, that admirably repre&s;ent,
and corre&s;pond to its different qua|lities and genius. The beginning of the
&s;e|cond &s;tanza, on the power which mu&s;ic ex|erts over the pa&s;&s;ions,
is a little flat, and by no means equal to the conclu&s;ion of that &s;tanza.
The animating &s;ong that Orpheus &s;ung to the Argonauts, copied from Valerius
Flaccus, for that of Apollonius is of a different nature, is the happily
cho&s;en &s;ubject of the fourth. On hearing which, 
<Q> 
<L>Each chief his &s;evenfold &s;hield di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>And half un&s;heath'd the &s;hining blade;</L></Q> Which effects of the &s;ong, however lively, do not equal the force and
&s;pirit of what Dryden a&s;cribes to the &s;ong of his Grecian arti&s;t; for
when Timotheus cries out REVENGE, rai&s;es the furies, and calls up to
Alexander's view a troop of Grecian gho&s;ts that were &s;lain and left
unburied, inglorious and forgotten, each of them waving a torch in his hand,
and pointing to the ho&s;tile temples of the Per&s;ians, and demanding
vengeance of their prince, he <PB N="55" REF="66"> in&s;tantly &s;tarted from
his throne, 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to de&s;troy,</L></Q> while Thais and the attendant princes ru&s;hed out with him, to &s;et fire
to the city. The whole train of imagery in this &s;tanza is alive, &s;ublime,
and animated to an unparallelled degree; the poet had &s;o &s;trongly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the action de&s;cribed, that he places it fully
before the eyes of the reader.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cent of Orpheus into hell is grace|fully introduced in the fourth &s;tanza, as it naturally flowed from the &s;ubject of the pre|ceding one; the de&s;cription of the infernal regions is well imagined, and the effects of the mu&s;ician's lyre on the inhabitants of hell, are elegantly tran&s;lated from the fourth Geor|gic of Virgil, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 480.</NOTE> and happily adapted to the &s;ubject in que&s;tion. The &s;upplicating &s;ong at the beginning of the &s;ixth &s;tanza, is highly pathetic and poetical, e&s;pecially when he con|jures the powers below,<Q><PB N="56" REF="67">
<L>By the hero's armed &s;hades</L>
<L>Glittering through the gloomy glades,</L>
<L>By the youths that dy'd for love</L>
<L>Wand'ring in the myrtle grove;</L></Q> The&s;e images are picture&s;que and appro|priated; and the&s;e are &s;uch notes as might,
<Q><L>Draw iron tears down Pluto's cheek, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton's Il Pen&s;ero&s;o.</NOTE></L>
<L>And make hell grant what love did &s;eek.</L></Q>
But the numbers that conclude this &s;tanza are of &s;o burle&s;que and ridiculous a kind, and have &s;o much the air of an Hudibra&s;tic &s;ong at a county election, that one is amazed and con|cerned to find them in a &s;erious ode, and in an ode of a writer eminently &s;killed, in gene|ral, in accommodating his &s;ounds to his &s;en|timents.<Q><L>Thus &s;ong could prevail</L>
<L>O'er death and o'er hell,</L>
<L>A conque&s;t how hard and how glorious!</L>
<L>Tho' fate had fa&s;t bound her</L>
<L>With Styx nine times round her,</L>
<L>Yet mu&s;ic and love were victorious.</L></Q><PB N="57" REF="68">
One would imagine that John Dennis, or &s;ome hero of the Dunciad, had been here attempting to trave&s;ty this de&s;cription of the re&s;toration of Eurydice to life. It is ob&s;ervable, that this is the very mea&s;ure, Addi&s;on thought was pro|per to u&s;e in the comic character of Sir Tru&s;ty; by the introduction of which he has &s;o &s;trange|ly deba&s;ed and degraded his opera of Ro&s;a|mond.<Q><L>How unhappy is he</L>

<P>VIRGIL is again imitated throughout the
<PB N="58" REF="69">
&s;ixth &s;tanza, which de&s;cribes the behaviour of Orpheus on the &s;econd lo&s;s of Eurydice. I wi&s;h POPE had in&s;erted that &s;triking circum|&s;tance, &s;o &s;trongly imagined, of a certain me|lancholy murmur, or rather di&s;mal &s;hriek, that was heard all around the lakes of Aver|nus, the moment Orpheus looked back on his wife;
<Q><L>&mdash;Terque fragor &s;tagnis auditus Avernis. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Georgic 4, 493.</NOTE></L></Q>
And as pro&s;opopeias are a great beauty in lyric poetry, &s;urely he &s;hould not have omit|ted tho&s;e natural and pathetic exclamations of Eurydice, the moment &s;he was &s;natched back, and which &s;he uttered as &s;he was gra|dually &s;inking to the &s;hades, e&s;pecially where &s;he movingly takes her la&s;t adieu,
<Q><L>Jamque vale!&mdash;</L></Q>
And adds, that &s;he is now &s;urrounded with a va&s;t darkne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"feror ingenti circumdata
<PB N="59" REF="70">
nocte,"</Q> and in vain &s;tretching out her feeble arms towards him,
<Q><L>Invalida&s;que tibi tendens, heu! non tua, palmas. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 498.</NOTE></L></Q>
This lively and pathetic attitude would have &s;hone under the hands of POPE. The reader, I pre&s;ume, feels the effect of the judi|cious placing in the ver&s;e, <HI>heu! non tua,</HI> and of its repetition after <HI>tibi.</HI> The places in which Orpheus, according to POPE, made his lamentations, are not &s;o wild, &s;o &s;avage and di&s;mal, as tho&s;e mentioned by Virgil; to introduce him <Q REND="inline">"be&s;ide the falls of foun|tains,"</Q> conveys not &s;uch an image of de&s;o|lation and de&s;pair, as the caverns on the banks of Strymon and Tanais, the Hyperborean de&s;arts, and the Riphaean &s;olitudes. And to &s;ay of Hebrus, only, that it <Q REND="inline">"rolls in mean|ders,"</Q> is flat and frigid, and does not heighten the melancholy of the place. There is an antithe&s;is in the &s;ucceeding lines, <Q REND="inline">"he glows amid Rhodope's &s;nows,"</Q> which I hope the
<PB N="60" REF="71">
poet did not intend, as it would be a trivial and puerile conceit. The death of Orpheus is expre&s;&s;ed with a beautiful brevity and ab|ruptne&s;s, &s;uitable to the nature of the ode;<Q><L>Hark! Haemus re&s;ounds with the Bacchanals cries,</L>
<L>Ah! &s;ee he dies!</L>
<L>Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he <HI>&s;ung.</HI></L></Q> Where in&s;tead of <HI>&s;ung,</HI> Virgil &s;ays <HI>vocabat,</HI> which is more natural and tender; and Virgil adds a very moving epithet, that he called <HI>mi&s;eram</HI> Eurydicen. I am &s;en&s;ible POPE never intended an exact tran&s;lation of the pa&s;&s;ages of the Georgics here alleged; I only hint, that in my humble judgment he has omitted &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking incidents in the &s;tory. I have lately &s;een a manu&s;cript ode, entitled, <Q REND="inline">"On the U&s;e and Abu&s;e of Po|etry,"</Q> in which Orpheus in con&s;idered in ano|ther, and a higher light, according to ancient mythology, as the fir&s;t legi&s;lator and civilizer of mankind.

&s;ubject of the &s;econd, the power of mu&s;ic over the pa&s;&s;ions, which may perhaps be reckoned a blameable tautology; e&s;pecially as the&s;e lines,<Q><L>Mu&s;ic the fierce&s;t grief can charm,</L>

<P><PB N="63" REF="74">
IT is to be regretted, that Mr. Handel has not &s;et to mu&s;ic the former, as well as the latter, of the&s;e celebrated odes, in which he has di&s;played the combined powers of ver&s;e and voice, to a wonderful degree. No poem indeed, affords &s;o much various matter for a compo&s;er to work upon; as Dryden has here introduced and expre&s;&s;ed all the greater pa&s;&s;i|ons, and as the tran&s;itions from one to the other are &s;udden and impetuous. Of which we feel the effects, in the pathetic de&s;cription of the fall of Darius, that immediately &s;ucceeds the joyous prai&s;es of Bacchus. The &s;ymphony, and air particularly, that accompanies the four words, <Q REND="inline">"fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,"</Q> is &s;trangely moving, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mention of this pathetic air, reminds me of a &s;tory of the celebrated Lully, who having been one day accu&s;ed of ne|ver &s;etting any thing to mu&s;ic, but the languid ver&s;es of Quin|ault, was immediately animated with the reproach, and as it were &s;eized with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m; he ran in&s;tantly to his harp&s;ichord, and &s;triking a few cords, &s;ung in recitative the&s;e four lines in the Iphigenia of Racine, which are full of the &s;tronge&s;t imagery, and are therefore much more difficult to ex|pre&s;s in mu&s;ic, than ver&s;es of mere &s;entiment, <Q><L>Un pr&ecirc;tre environn&eacute; d'une foule cruelle</L>

<P>The opinion of Boileau concerning mu&s;ic is remarkable; he a&s;&s;erts, qu'on ne peut jamais faire un bon opera; parceque la mu&s;ique ne &s;auroit narrer; que les pa&s;&s;ions n'y peuvent etre peintes dans toute l'etendu&euml; qu'elles demandent; que d'ail|leurs elle ne &s;auroit &s;ouvent mettre en chant les expre&s;&s;ions vraiment &s;ublimes et courageu&s;es.</P></NOTE> and con&s;i&s;ts of a few <PB N="64" REF="75"> &s;imple and
touching notes, without any of tho&s;e intricate variations, and affected
divi|&s;ions, into which, in compliance with a vici|ous and vulgar ta&s;te,
this great ma&s;ter hath &s;ometimes de&s;cended. Even this piece of Handel,
&s;o excellent on the whole, is not free from one or two blemi&s;hes of this
&s;ort, particularly in the air, 
<Q REND="inline">"with ravi&s;h'd ears,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE moderns have perhaps practi&s;ed no &s;pecies of poetry with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, and with &s;uch indi&s;putable inferiority to the anci|ents,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
as the ODE; which &s;eems owing to the har&s;hne&s;s and untuneablene&s;s of modern languages, abounding in mono&s;yllables, and crowded with con&s;onants. This particularly is the ca&s;e of the Engli&s;h, who&s;e original is Teutonic, and which therefore, is not &s;o mu|&s;ical as the Italian, the Spani&s;h, or even the French, as not having &s;o great a quantity of words derived from the Latin.

the ear, by its tedi|ous uniformity, and by the number of iden|tical cadences.
And indeed to &s;peak truth, there appears to be little valuable in Petrarch,
except the purity of his diction. His &s;enti|ments even of love, are
metaphy&s;ical and far fetched, neither is there much variety in his
&s;ubjects, or fancy in his method of treating them; Meta&s;ta&s;io is a much
better lyric poet. When Boileau attempted an ode, he exhibited a glaring proof,
of what will be more fully in&s;i&s;ted on in the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay,
that the writer who&s;e grand, characteri&s;tical talent, is

Perrault, though the maje&s;ty of this &s;pecies of compo&s;itions is &s;o much
injured, by de&s;cending to per&s;onal &s;atire. The name of Malherbe is
re&s;pectable, as he was the fir&s;t re|former of the French poe&s;y, and the
fir&s;t who gave his countrymen any idea of a legi|timate ode, though his own
pieces have hardly any thing but harmony to recommend them. The odes of la
Motte, are fuller of delicate <PB N="68" REF="79"> &s;entiment, and
philo&s;ophical reflection, than of imagery, of figures, and poetry. There are
particular &s;tanzas eminently good, but not one entire ode. Some of
Rou&s;&s;eau, particu|larly that to Fortune, and &s;ome of his p&s;alms; and
one or two of Voltaire, particularly, to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, on his

mea&s;ure the degrees of the meridian towards the equator, &s;eem to ri&s;e
above that correct mediocrity which di&s;tingui&s;hes the lyric poetry of the

<P>THE next LYRIC compo&s;itions of Pope, are two choru&s;es in&s;erted in a very heavy tragedy, altered from Shake&s;pear by the Duke of Buck|ingham; in which we &s;ee, that the mo&s;t accu|rate ob&s;ervation of dramatic rules without genius, is of no effect. The&s;e choru&s;es are
<PB N="71" REF="82">
extremely elegant and harmonious; but are they not chargeable with the fault, which Ari&s;totle imputes to many of Euripides, that they are foreign and adventitious to the &s;ub|ject, and contribute nothing towards the ad|vancement of the main action? Whereas the chorus ought, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> to be a part or member of the one Whole, cooperate with it, and help to accela|rate the intended event; as is con&s;tantly, adds the philo&s;opher, the practi&s;e of Sophocles. Whereas the&s;e reflections of POPE on the baneful influences of war, on the arts and learning, and on the univer&s;al power of love, &s;eem to be too general, are not &s;ufficiently appropriated, do not ri&s;e from the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion, and might be in&s;erted with e|qual propriety in twenty other tragedies. This remark of Ari&s;totle, tho he does not him&s;elf produce any examples, may be verified from the following among many others. In the Phoenicians of Euripides, they &s;ing

<P>ON the other hand, the choru&s;es of Sopho|cles never de&s;ert the &s;ubject of each particular drama, and all their &s;entiments and reflections are drawn from the &s;ituation of the principal per&s;onage of the fable. Nay Sophocles hath

As in the Antigone, with equal beauty and decorum in an addre&s;s to the god of love, at ver&s;e 791 of that play. And thus la&s;tly, when

<P>THE judicious author of the tragedy of Elfrida, hath given occa&s;ion to a kind of controver&s;y among the more curious critics, concerning the utility of the chorus, which, after the model of the ancients, he hath en|deavoured to revive. To imagine, that the great Grecian ma&s;ters retained it only out of re&s;pect to its antiquity, and from no intrin|&s;ic
<PB N="75" REF="86">
valuablene&s;s or propriety of the thing, can &s;carcely be imagined. The &s;entiments of the excellent Brumoy are moderate and rational, and &s;eem to comprehend all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid on this &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline">"I know &s;ays he, the chorus is attended with inconve|niences, and that it has &s;ometimes com|pelled the ancients to violate probability; but it notwith&s;tanding is apparent by the u&s;e they &s;ometimes made of it, that its advantages exceed its inconveniences. Sophocles had the addre&s;s to withdraw his chorus for a few moments, when their ab&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary, as in the Ajax. If the chorus therefore incommodes the poet, and puts him under difficulties, he mu&s;t charge it &s;olely to his own want of dexterity. What advantage, on the other hand, may he not reap, from a body of actors that fill the &s;tage; that render more lively, &s;triking, and &s;en&s;ible, the continuity of the action, and give it the air of greater PROBABILITY, &s;ince it is not natural or con|ceivable, that a great and illu&s;trious action,
<PB N="76" REF="87">
&s;uch as a revolution in a &s;tate, &s;hould pa&s;s without witne&s;&s;es. We perceive and feel a kind of void on our &s;tage, on account of the ab|&s;ence of choru&s;es; and the &s;ucce&s;sful attempt of Racine, who adopted and revived the u&s;e of them in his ATHALIA and ESTHER, were &s;ufficient, one would imagine, to undeceive and convince us, of their importance, and utility. The bani&s;hment of the chorus has been the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the cu&s;|tom of the moderns, to take for their repre|&s;entations, ALL kinds of &s;ubjects; whereas the ancients treated only &s;uch actions as were publicly tran&s;acted: and to fill, and indeed overcharge the action with incidents and &s;urprizes. For how could the&s;e &s;ub|jects, and the&s;e various crowded events and incidents, have been po&s;&s;ibly introduced in a public place, expo&s;ed to the view of cour|tiers and the people, while the generality of our tragedies turn on particular and pri|vate affairs, ou la cour et le peuple n'en|trent &s;ouvent pour rien? the Athenian &s;pec|tators were ever accu&s;tomed to concern

them&s;elves in all public affairs, and to be witne&s;&s;es and judges of them. The modern &s;tage, by its di&s;u&s;e of the chorus, may per|haps have gained a great number of fine &s;ubjects for tragedy; yet, in return, it is burthened with confidents, it loo&s;es the continuity of action, and is deprived of the magnificent &s;pectacle that &s;erves to &s;upport that action, and which is, if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion, le <HI>fonds,</HI> ou l <HI>'accom|pagnement</HI> du tableau."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Theatre de Grecs.

naturally ari&s;e from the &s;ubject; it has how|ever kept us too long from &s;urveying a valuable literary curio&s;ity, I mean the earlie&s;t produc|tion of POPE, written when he was not twelve years old, his ODE ON SOLITUDE. The fir&s;t &s;ketches of &s;uch an arti&s;t ought highly to be prized. Different geniu&s;es unfold them|&s;elves, at different periods of life. In &s;ome minds the ore is a long time in ripening. Not only inclination, but opportunity and encou|ragement, a proper &s;ubject, or a proper pa|tron, influence the exertion or the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of genius. The&s;e &s;tanzas on Solitude, are a &s;trong in&s;tance of that contemplative and mo|ral turn, which was the di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|teri&s;tic of our poet's mind. An ode of Cowley which he produced at the age of thirteen years, is of the &s;ame ca&s;t, and perhaps not in the lea&s;t inferior to this of POPE. The voluminous Lopez de Vega, is commonly, but I fear incredibly, reported by the Spani|ards, to have compo&s;ed ver&s;es when he was five years old; and Torquato Ta&s;&s;o, the &s;e|cond

of the Italian poets, for that wonderful original Dante is the fir&s;t, is &s;aid to have re|cited poems and orations of his writing, when he was &s;even. It is however certain, which is more extraordinary, that he produced his Rinaldo in his eighteenth year, no bad pre|cur&s;or to the Gieru&s;alemma Liberata, and no &s;mall effort of that genius, which was one day to &s;hew, how fine an epic poem the Ita|lian language, notwith&s;tanding the vulgar imputation of effeminacy, was capable of producing.</P>
<P>THOSE who are fond of biographical anec|dotes, which are &s;ome of the mo&s;t amu&s;ive and in&s;tructive parts of hi&s;tory, will be per|haps plea&s;ed with the following particulars in the life of POPE. He frequently declared, that the time of his beginning to write ver&s;es, was &s;o very early in his life, that he could &s;carcely recal it to his memory. When he was yet a child, his father, who had been a mer|chant in London, and retired to Binfield with about twenty thou&s;and pounds, would fre|quently
<PB N="80" REF="91">
order him to make Engli&s;h ver&s;es. It &s;eems he was difficult to be plea&s;ed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Works, vol. 4. pag. 18.</NOTE> and would make the lad correct them again and again. When at la&s;t he approved them, he took great plea&s;ure in peru&s;ing them, and would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e are good RHYMES."</Q> The&s;e early prai&s;es of a tender and re&s;pected parent, cooperating with the natural inclina|tion of the &s;on, may po&s;&s;ibly be the cau&s;es that fixed our young bard in a re&s;olution of becoming eminent in this art. He was taught to read very early by an aunt; and of his own indefatigable indu&s;try learned to write, by copying printed books, which he executed with great neatne&s;s and exactne&s;s. When he was eight years old, he was put under the direction of one Taverner, a prie&s;t, who taught him the rudiments of the latin and greek tongues together. About this time he accidentally met with Ogilby's tran&s;lation of Homer, which, notwith&s;tanding the deadne&s;s and in&s;ipidity of the ver&s;ification, arre&s;ted
<PB N="81" REF="92">
his attention by the force of the &s;tory. The Ovid of Sandys fell next in his way; and it is &s;aid, that the raptures the&s;e tran&s;lations gave him were &s;o &s;trong, that he &s;poke of them with plea&s;ure to the period of his life. About ten, being now at &s;chool at Hide-park corner, whither he went from a popi&s;h &s;emi|nary at Twiford, near Winche&s;ter, he was carried &s;ometimes to the playhou&s;e; and be|ing &s;truck, we may imagine, with theatrical repre&s;entations, he turned the chief events into a kind of play, made up of a number of &s;peeches from Ogilby's tran&s;lation, connected with ver&s;es of his own. He per&s;uaded the upper boys to act this piece, which, from its curio&s;ity, one would have been glad to have beheld. The ma&s;ter's gardener repre&s;ented the character of Ajax; and the actors were dre&s;&s;ed after the pictures of his favourite Ogil|by, far the be&s;t part of that book, as they were de&s;igned and engraved by arti&s;ts of note. At twelve, he retired with his father into Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t; and it was there he fir&s;t peru&s;ed the writings of Waller, of Spen&s;er,
<PB N="82" REF="93">
and of Dryden. The &s;econd is &s;aid to have made a poet of Cowley; that Ogilby &s;hould give our author his fir&s;t poetic plea&s;ures, is a remarkable circum&s;tance. On the fir&s;t &s;ight of Dryden he abandoned the re&s;t, having now found an author, who&s;e ca&s;t was exactly con|genial with his own. His works therefore he &s;tudied, with equal plea&s;ure and attention: he placed them before his eyes as a model; of which more will be &s;aid in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers. He copied not only his harmo|nious ver&s;ification, but the very turns of his periods. It was hence he was enabled to give to rhyme all the harmony of which it is capable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See WORKS, vol. 4. pag. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>ABOUT this time, that is about fifteen years old, he began to write his ALCANDER, an epic poem, of which he him&s;elf &s;peaks with &s;o much amiable frankne&s;s and ingenuity, in a pa&s;&s;age re&s;tored to his excellent preface to his works. <Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s there was a time when

QUINTILIAN, who&s;e knowledge of human nature was con&s;ummate, has ob&s;erved, that nothing very correct and faultle&s;s, is to be ex|pected in very early years, from a truly ele|vated genius: that a generous extravagance and exuberance are its proper marks, and that a premature exactne&s;s is a certain evi|dence of future flatne&s;s and &s;terility.

Whether the&s;e early productions of POPE, would not have appeared to Quintilian to be rather too fini&s;hed, correct, and pure, and what he would have inferred concerning them, is too delicate a &s;ubject for me to enlarge upon. Let me rather add an entertaining anecdote. When Guido and Domenichino had each of them painted a picture in the Church of Saint Andrew, Annibal Carrache, their ma&s;ter, was pre&s;&s;ed to declare, which of his two pupils had excelled. The picture of Guido repre&s;ented Saint Andrew on his knees before the cro&s;s, that of Domenichino repre&s;ented the flagel|lation of that apo&s;tle. Both of them in their different kinds were capital pieces, and were painted in fre&s;co, oppo&s;ite each other, to eter|nize, as it were, their rival&s;hip and conten|tion
<PB N="86" REF="97">
Guido, &s;aid Carrache, has performed as a ma&s;ter, and Domenichino as a &s;cholar. But, added he, the worth of the &s;cholar is more valuable than that of the ma&s;ter. In truth, one may perceive faults in the picture of Domenichino that Guido has avoided; but then there are noble &s;trokes, not to be found in that of his rival. It was ea&s;y to di&s;cern a genius that promi&s;ed to produce beauties, to which the &s;weet, the gentle, and the grace|ful Guido would never a&s;pire.</P>
<P>The la&s;t piece that belongs to this Section, is the ODE entitled, THE DYING CHRISTIAN TO HIS SOUL, written in imitation of the well known &s;onnet of Hadrian, addre&s;t to his departing &s;pirit; concerning which it was our author's judicious opinion, that the dimi|nutive epithets with which it abounds, &s;uch as Vagula, Blandula, were by no means expre&s;&s;ions of levity and indifference, but rather of endear|ment, of tenderne&s;s and concern.

<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing re&s;emblances from thefts; and of what a late critic has urged, that a want of &s;eeming originality ari&s;es frequently, not from a barrenne&s;s and timidity of genius, but from invincible nece&s;&s;ity, and the nature of things: that the works of tho&s;e who profe&s;s an art, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence is imitation, mu&s;t needs be &s;tamped with a clo&s;e re&s;emblance to each other, &s;ince the objects material or animate, extraneous or internal, which they all imi|tate, lie equally open to the ob&s;ervation of all, and are perfectly &s;imilar. De&s;criptions there|fore that are faithful and ju&s;t, MUST BE UNI|FORM AND ALIKE; the fir&s;t copier may be perhaps entitled to the prai&s;e of priority, but a &s;ucceeding one ought not certainly to be condemned for plagiari&s;m.</P>
<P>THESE general ob&s;ervations however true, do not, I think, extend to the ca&s;e before us, becau&s;e not only the thoughts, but even the
<PB N="90" REF="101">
words are copied; and becau&s;e the images, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, are &s;uch, as are not imme|diately impre&s;&s;ed by &s;en&s;ible objects, and which therefore, on account of their SINGU|LARITY, did not lie in common for any poet to &s;eize. Let us however moderate the matter, and &s;ay, what perhaps is the real fact, that POPE fell into the thoughts of Flatman una|wares, and without de&s;ign; and having for|merly read him, imperceptibly adopted this pa&s;&s;age, even without knowing that he had borrowed it. That this will frequently hap|pen, is evident from the following curious particulars related by Menage, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anti-baillet. tom.

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the ESSAY on Critici&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now arrived at a poem of that &s;pecies, for which our author's ge|nius was particularly turned, the DIDACTIC and the MORAL; it is therefore, as might be expected, a ma&s;ter-piece in its kind. I have been &s;ometimes inclined to think, that the prai&s;es Addi&s;on has be&s;towed on it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N^o. 253.</NOTE> were a little partial and invidious. <Q REND="inline">"The ob&s;erva|tions, &s;ays he, follow one another, like tho&s;e in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that methodical regularity which would have been requi&s;ite in a pro&s;e writer."</Q> It is however certain, that the poem before us is by no means de&s;titute of a ju&s;t integrity, and a lucid order: each of the precepts and re|marks naturally introduce the &s;ucceeding ones, &s;o as to form an entire whole. The ingeni|ous Mr. Hurd, hath al&s;o u&s;efully &s;hewn, that
<PB N="101" REF="112">
Horace ob&s;erved a &s;trict method, and unity of de&s;ign, in his epi&s;tle to the Pi&s;ones, and that altho the connexions are delicately fine and almo&s;t imperceptible, like the &s;ecret hinges of a well-wrought box, yet they art|fully and clo&s;ely unite each part together, and give coherence, uniformity, and beauty to the work. The Spectator adds; <Q REND="inline">"The ob|&s;ervations in this e&s;&s;ay are <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them <HI>un|common;</HI>"</Q> there is, I fear, a &s;mall mixture of ill-nature in the&s;e words; for this ESSAY tho' on a beaten &s;ubject, abounds in many new remarks, and original rules, as well as in many happy and beautiful illu&s;trations, and applications of the old ones. We are indeed amazed to find &s;uch a knowledge of the world, &s;uch a maturity of judgment, and &s;uch a penetration into human nature, as are here di&s;played, in &s;o very young a writer as was POPE, when he produced this ESSAY; for he was not twenty years old. Correct|ne&s;s and a ju&s;t ta&s;te, are u&s;ually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art; but a clear head, and &s;trong &s;en&s;e were
<PB N="102" REF="113">
the characteri&s;tical qualities of our author, and every man &s;oone&s;t di&s;plays his radical excellencies. If his predominant talent be warmth and vigor of imagination, it will break out in fanciful and luxuriant de&s;crip|tions, the colouring of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing. If his chief force lies in the under&s;tanding rather than in the imagination, it will &s;oon appear by &s;olid and manly ob&s;ervations on life or learning, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in a more cha&s;t and &s;ubdued &s;tyle. The former will frequently be hurried into ob&s;curity or turgidity, and a fal&s;e grandeur of diction; the latter will &s;eldom hazard a figure, who&s;e u&s;age is not already e&s;tabli&s;hed, or an image beyond common life; will always be per&s;picuous if not elevated; will never di&s;|gu&s;t, if not tran&s;port his readers; will avoid the gro&s;&s;er faults, if not arrive at the greater beauties of compo&s;ition; The <Q REND="inline">"eloquentiae genus,"</Q> for which he will be di&s;tingui&s;hed, will not be the <Q REND="inline">"plenum, &amp; erectum, &amp; audax, &amp; praecultum,"</Q> but the <Q REND="inline">"pre&s;&s;um,

<P>DU BOS <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sect. x. 2.</NOTE> fixes the period of time, at which, generally &s;peaking, the poets and the painters have arrived at as high a pitch of perfection, as their geniu&s;es will permit, to be the age of thirty years, or a few years more or le&s;s. Virgil was near thirty when he compo&s;ed his fir&s;t Eclogue; Horace was a grown man when he began to be talked of at Rome as a poet, having been formerly engaged in a bu&s;y military life. Racine was about the &s;ame age when his ANDROMACHE, which may be regarded as his fir&s;t good tragedy, was played. Corneille was more than thirty
<PB N="104" REF="115">
when his CID appeared. De&s;preaux was full thirty when he publi&s;hed his &s;atires, &s;uch as we now have them; Moliere was full forty when he wrote the fir&s;t of tho&s;e comedies, on which his reputation is founded. But to excell in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, it was not &s;ufficient for Moliere to be only a great poet; but it was more nece&s;&s;ary for him to gain a thorough knowledge of men and the world, which is &s;eldom attained &s;o early in life, but without which, the be&s;t poet would be able to write but very indifferent comedies. Raphael was about thirty years old al&s;o, when he di&s;played the beauty and &s;ublimity of his genius in the Vatican. For it is there we be|hold the fir&s;t of his works, that are worthy the great name he at pre&s;ent &s;o de&s;ervedly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es. When our Shake&s;pear wrote his LEAR, Milton his PARADISE LOST, Spen&s;er his FAIRY QUEEN, and Dryden his MUSIC ODE, they were all of them pa&s;t the middle age of man. From this &s;hort review it ap|pears, that few poets ripened &s;o early as POPE; who &s;eems literally and &s;trictly to have
<PB N="105" REF="116">
fulfilled the precept of Horace in each of it's circum&s;tances;
<Q><L>Multa tulit, fecitque PUER;</L></Q>
he was laborious and indefatigable in his pur|&s;uits of learning;

and above all, what is of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence in pre&s;erving each faculty of the mind in due vigour,
<Q><L>Ab&s;tinuit venere et vino;</L></Q>
the&s;e are the two temptations to which a youthful bard is principally &s;ubject, and into who&s;e &s;nares he generally falls. If the ima|gination be lively, the pa&s;&s;ions will be &s;trong. True genius &s;eldom re&s;ides in a cold and phleg|matic con&s;titution. The &s;ame temperament, and the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility that makes a poet or a painter, will be apt to make a man a lover and a debauchee. POPE was happily &s;ecured from falling into the&s;e common failings, the bane of &s;o many others, by the weakne&s;s and
<PB N="106" REF="117">
delicacy of his body, and the bad &s;tate of his health. The &s;en&s;ual vices were too violent for &s;o tender a frame; he never fell into intemperance and di&s;&s;ipation. May I add, that even his bodily make was of u&s;e to him as a writer; for one who was acquainted with the heart of man, and the &s;ecret &s;prings of our actions, has ob&s;erved with great penetra|tion; <Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon's E&s;&s;ays. 44.</NOTE>It is good to con&s;ider deformity, not as a &s;igne, which is more deceivable, but as a cau&s;e, which &s;eldom faileth of the effect.

It is &s;omewhere remarked by Dryden, I think, that none but a poet is qualified to judge of a poet. The maxim is however contradicted by experience. Ari&s;totle is &s;aid indeed to have written one ode; but neither Bo&s;&s;u nor Hurd, are poets. The penetrating author of the Reflexions on Poetry, Painting, and Mu&s;ic, will for ever be read with delight, and with profit by all ingenious arti&s;ts; il ne &s;avait pourtant pas la mu&s;ique, &s;ays Voltaire, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Louis 14. p. 354.</NOTE> il n'avoit jamais pu faire de vers, &amp; n'avoit pas un tableau: mais il avoit beaucoup l&ucirc;, v&ucirc;, entend&ucirc;, &amp; reflechi.

The &s;ame writer never pre&s;umed to undertake more than one kind of dramatic poetry, if we except the CYCLOPS of Euripides.

We therefore of Great-Britain have perhaps more rea&s;on to congratulate our&s;elves, on two very &s;ingular phenomena; I mean, Shake&s;pear's being able to pourtray characters &s;o very different as FALSTAFF, and MACKBETH; and Garrick's being able to per&s;onate &s;o inimitably a LEAR, or an ABEL DRUGGER.

<P> FROM their inattention to the&s;e particulars, many critics, and particularly the French, have been guilty of great ab&s;urdities. When Perrault impotently attempted to ridicule the fir&s;t &s;tanza of the fir&s;t Olympic of Pindar, he was ignorant that the poet, in beginning with the prai&s;es of WATER<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>, alluded to the philo&s;ophy of Thales, who taught that water was the principle of all things; and which philo&s;ophy, Empedocles the Sicilian, a co|temporary of Pindar, and a &s;ubject of Hiero to whom Pindar wrote, had adopted in his beautiful poem. Homer and the Greek tra|gedians have been likewi&s;e cen&s;ured, the for|mer for protracting the Iliad after the death of Hector; and the latter, for continuing the AJAX and PHOENISSAE, after the deaths of their re&s;pective heroes. But the cen&s;urers did not con&s;ider the importance of burial among
<PB N="133" REF="144">
the ancients: and that the action of the Iliad would have been imperfect without a de|&s;cription of the funeral rites for Hector and Patroclus; as the two tragedies, without tho&s;e of Polynices and Eteocles: for the an|cients e&s;teemed a deprivation of &s;epulture to be a more &s;evere calamity than death it&s;elf. It is ob&s;ervable that this circum&s;tance did not occur to POPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad 23. Note I.</NOTE>, when he endeavoured to ju&s;tify this conduct of Homer, by only &s;ay|ing, that as the anger of Achilles does not die with Hector, but per&s;ecutes his very re|mains, the poet &s;till keeps up to his &s;ubject by de&s;cribing the many effects of that anger, 'till it is fully &s;atisfied: and that for this rea&s;on, the two la&s;t books of the Iliad may be thought not to be excre&s;cencies, but e&s;&s;ential to the poem.

<P>THE arts u&s;ed by Addi&s;on to &s;uppre&s;s the ri&s;ing merit of POPE, which are now fully laid open, give one pain to behold, to what mean artifices envy and malignity will com|pel a gentleman and a genius to de&s;cend. It is certain, that Addi&s;on di&s;couraged POPE from in&s;erting the machinery in the Rape of the Lock: that he privately in&s;inuated that POPE was a Tory and a Jacobite; and had a hand in writing the Examiners: that Addi&s;on him&s;elf tran&s;lated the fir&s;t book of Homer, publi&s;hed under Tickel's name: and that he &s;ecretly encouraged Gildon to abu&s;e POPE in a virulent pamphlet, for which Addi&s;on paid Gildon ten guineas. This u&s;age extorted from POPE the famous character of Atticus,
<PB N="160" REF="171">
which is perhaps the fine&s;t piece of &s;atire extant. It is &s;aid, that when Racine read his tragedy of Alexander to Corneille, the latter gave him many general commendations, but advi&s;ed him to apply his genius, as not being adapted to the drama, to &s;ome other &s;pecies of poetry.

<P>THE di&s;&s;olute reign of Charles II. ju&s;tly de&s;erved the &s;atirical pro&s;cription in this pa&s;|&s;age. Under the notion of laughing at the ab&s;urd au&s;terities of the Puritans, it became the mode to run into the contrary extreme, and to ridicule real religion and unaffected virtue. The King, during his exile, had &s;een and admired the &s;plendor of the court of Louis XIV. and endeavoured to introduce the &s;ame luxury into the Engli&s;h court. The
<PB N="161" REF="172">
common opinion, that this was the Augu&s;tan age in England, is exce&s;&s;ively fal&s;e. A ju&s;t ta&s;te was by no means yet formed. What was called SHEER WIT, was alone &s;tudied and applauded. Roche&s;ter, it is &s;aid, had no idea that there could be a better poet than Cowley. The King was perpetually quoting HUDIBRAS. The neglect of &s;uch a poem as the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, will for ever remain a monu|ment of the bad ta&s;te that prevailed. It may be added, that the progre&s;s of philological learning, and of what is called the belle lettres, was perhaps ob&s;tructed by the in&s;ti|tution of the Royal Society; which turned the thoughts of men of genius to phy&s;ical enquiries. Our &s;tyle in pro&s;e was but begin|ning to be poli&s;hed: although the diction of Hobbes is &s;ufficiently pure; which philo&s;o|pher, and not the FLORID Spratt, was the cla&s;&s;ic of that age.

<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Corneille had no excellent author before his eyes, whom he could
follow: Racine had Corneille.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Corneille found the French &s;tage in a barbarous &s;tate, and
advanced it to great perfection: Racine has not &s;upported it in the
perfection in which he found it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The characters of Corneille are true, though they are not common:
The characters of Racine are not true, but only &s;o far forth as they are
common.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Sometimes the characters of Corneille, are, in &s;ome re|&s;pects,
fal&s;e and unnatural, in that they are noble and &s;ingular: Tho&s;e of Racine
are often, in &s;ome re&s;pects, low, on account of their being natural and
ordinary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. He that has a noble heart would chu&s;e to re&s;emble the heroes of
Corneille: He that has a little heart is plea&s;ed to find his own
re&s;emblance in the heroes of Racine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. We carry, from hearing the pieces of the One, a de&s;ire to be
virtuous: And we carry the plea&s;ure of finding men like our&s;elves in
foibles and weakne&s;&s;es, from the pieces of the Other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The Tender and the Graceful of Racine is &s;ometimes to be found in
Corneille: The Grand and Sublime of Corneille is never to be found in
Racine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Racine has painted only the French and the pre&s;ent age, even when
he de&s;igned to paint another age, and other nations: We &s;ee in Corneille,
all tho&s;e ages and all tho&s;e na|tions, that he intended to paint.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. The number of the pieces of Corneille is much greater than that of
Racine: Corneille, notwith&s;tanding, has made fewer tautologies and
repetitions than Racine has made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. In the pa&s;&s;ages where the ver&s;ification of Corneille is good, it
is more bold, more noble, and, at the &s;ame time, as pure and as fini&s;hed as
that of Racine; but it is not pre&s;erved in this degree of beauty: and that of
Racine is always equally &s;upported.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. Authors inferior to Racine have written &s;ucce&s;sfully after him,
in his own way: No author, not even Racine him|&s;elf, dared to attempt, after
Corneille, that kind of writing which was peculiar to him.</ITEM>
</LIST> 
<P>This compari&s;on, of the ju&s;tne&s;s of which the reader is left to judge, is &s;aid greatly to have irritated Boileau, the invariable friend and defender of Racine. It may be remarked, that Boileau had mentioned Fontenelle with contempt, in a &s;tanza that originally concluded his Ode to the King, at pre&s;ent omitted. The&s;e were the lines. <Q><L>J'aime mieux nouvel Jcare</L>

<L>La terre, comme Perault.</L></Q> This ode was parodied in France; but not with &s;uch incom|parable humour, as by our Prior, in England.</P> 
<P>To the&s;e remarks of Fontenelle may be added what Voltaire &s;ays, with his u&s;ual vivacity and brevity; <Q REND="inline">"Corneille alone formed him&s;elf; but Louis XIV. Colbert, Sophocles, and Euripides, all of them contributed to form Racine."</Q></P></NOTE> author and Racine returned one day in high &s;pirits from
Ver&s;ailles with two hone&s;t citizens of Paris. As their con|ver&s;ation 
<PB N="166" REF="177"> was full of gaiety and humour, the two citizens were
va&s;tly delighted: and one of them, at parting, &s;topt Boileau with this

<P>A NOBLE and ju&s;t character of the fir&s;t and the be&s;t of critics! And &s;ufficient to repre&s;s the fa&s;hionable and nau&s;eous petulance of &s;e|veral impertinent moderns, who have at|tempted to di&s;credit this great and u&s;eful writer! Whoever &s;urveys the variety and per|fection of his productions, all delivered in the cha&s;te&s;t &s;tyle, in the cleare&s;t order, and the mo&s;t pregnant brevity, is amazed at the im|men&s;ity of his genius. His logic, however at pre&s;ent neglected for tho&s;e redundant and verbo&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which took their ri&s;e from Locke's E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding, is a mighty effort of the mind: in which are di&s;covered the principal &s;ources of the art of rea&s;oning, and the dependencies of one thought on another; and where, by the different combinations he hath made of all the forms
<PB N="169" REF="180">
the under&s;tanding can a&s;&s;ume in rea&s;oning, which he hath traced for it, he hath &s;o clo&s;ely confined it, that it cannot depart from them, without arguing incon&s;equentially. His Phy&s;ics contain many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, particularly his Hi&s;tory of Animals; to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in which, Alexander gave orders, that creatures of different climates and countries &s;hould, at a great expence, be brought to him, to pa&s;s under his in&s;pection. His Mo|rals are perhaps the pure&s;t &s;y&s;tem in antiquity. His Politics are a mo&s;t valuable monument of the civil wi&s;dom of the ancients; as they pre&s;erve to us the de&s;cription of &s;everal go|vernments, and particularly of Crete and Car|thage, that otherwi&s;e would have been un|known. But of all his compo&s;itions, his Rhetoric and Poetics are mo&s;t complete. No writer has &s;hewn a greater penetration into rece&s;&s;es of the human heart, than this philo&s;o|pher, in the &s;econd book of his Rhetoric; where he treats of the different manners and pa&s;&s;ions, that di&s;tingui&s;h each different age and condition of man; and from whence Horace

No &s;ucceeding writer on eloquence, not even Tully, has added any thing new or important on this &s;ubject. His Poetics, which I &s;uppo&s;e are here by POPE chiefly referred to, &s;eem to have been written for the u&s;e of that prince, with who&s;e education Ari&s;totle was honoured, to give him a ju&s;t ta&s;te in reading Homer and the tragedians: to judge properly of which, was then thought no unnece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;h|ment in the character of a prince. To at|tempt to under&s;tand poetry without having diligently dige&s;ted this treati&s;e, would be as ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible, as to pretend to a &s;kill in geometry, without having &s;tudied Euclid. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and &s;ixteenth chap|ters, wherein he has pointed out the propere&s;t methods of exciting TERROR and PITY, con|vince us, that he was intimately acquainted with tho&s;e objects, which mo&s;t forcibly affect the

The prime excellence of this precious treati&s;e is the &s;chola&s;tic preci&s;ion, and philo|&s;ophical clo&s;ene&s;s, with which the &s;ubject is handled, without any addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions, or imagination.

It &s;eems al&s;o to be another common mi&s;take, that one of Horace's characteri&s;tics is the SUBLIME: of which indeed he has given a very few &s;trokes, and tho&s;e taken from Pin|dar, and, probably, from Alcaeus. His excel|lence lay in exqui&s;ite ob&s;ervations on human life, and in touching the foibles of mankind with delicacy and urbanity. 'Tis ea&s;y to perceive this moral turn in all his compo|&s;itions: the writer of the epi&s;tles is di&s;cerned in the odes. Elegance, not &s;ublimity, was his grand characteri&s;tic. Horace is the mo&s;t popular author of all antiquity; the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e he abounds in images drawn from familiar life, and in remarks, that <Q REND="inline">"come home to mens bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms."</Q> Hence he is more frequently quoted and alluded to, than any poet of a higher ca&s;t.</P></ITEM>

THESE pro&s;aic lines, this &s;piritle&s;s elogy, are much below the merit of the critic whom they are intended to celebrate. POPE &s;eems here rather to have con&s;idered Diony&s;ius, as the author only of his little Treati&s;e concern|ing Homer; and to have in &s;ome mea&s;ure overlooked, or at lea&s;t not to have &s;ufficiently in&s;i&s;ted on, his mo&s;t excellent book, &Pgr;&Egr;&Rgr;&Igr; &Sgr;&Ugr;&Ngr;&THgr;&EEgr;&Sgr;&Egr;&OHgr;&Sgr; &Ogr;&Ngr;&Ogr;&Mgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr;, in which he has unfolded all the &s;ecret arts that render compo&s;ition harmonious.

As examples of the fir&s;t &s;pecies, he mentions Antimachus and Empe|docles in heroics, Pindar in lyric, Ae&s;chylus in tragic poetry, and Thucydides in hi&s;tory. As examples of the &s;econd, he produces He&s;iod

The FIRST, is the age of Philip and Alexander; about which time flouri&s;hed Socrates, Plato, Demo&s;thenes, Ari&s;totle, Ly&s;ippus, Apelles, Phidias, Prax|iteles, Thucydides, Xenophon, Ae&s;chylus, Eu|ripides, Sophocles, Ari&s;tophanes, Menander,

Philemon. The SECOND age, which has ne|ver yet been &s;ufficiently taken notice of, was that of Ptolomy Philadelphus, king of Aegypt; in which appeared Lycophron, Aratus, Ni|cander, Apollonius Rhodius, Theocritus, Cal|limachus, Erato&s;thenes, Philichus, Eri&s;i&s;tratus the phy&s;ician, Timaeus the hi&s;torian, Clean|thes, Diogenes the painter, and So&s;trates the architect. This prince, from his love of learning, commanded the Old Te&s;tament to be tran&s;lated into Greek. The THIRD age is that of Julius Cae&s;ar, and Augu&s;tus; marked with the illu&s;trious names of Laberius, Ca|tullus, Lucretius, Cicero, Livy, Varro, Vir|gil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Phae|drus, Vitruvius, Dio&s;corides. The FOURTH age was that of Julius II. and Leo X. which produced, Ario&s;to, Ta&s;&s;o, Fraca&s;torius, San|nazarius, Vida, Bembo, Sadolet, Machiavel, Guiccardin, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian. The FIFTH age, is that of Louis XIV. in France, and of king William and queen Anne in England: in which, or thereabouts, are to be found, Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Boi|leau,

<P>CONCERNING the particular encouragement given by Leo X. to polite literature, and the fine arts, I forbear to enlarge; becau&s;e a friend of mine is at pre&s;ent engaged in writing, THE HISTORY OF THE AGE OF LEO X. It is a noble period, and full of tho&s;e mo&s;t important events, which have had the greate&s;t influence on human affairs. Such as the di&s;covery of the We&s;t-Indies, by the Spaniards, and of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t, by the Portugueze; the invention of printing; the reformation of reli|ligion; with many others: all which will be

in&s;i&s;ted upon at large, and their con&s;equences di&s;played. I &s;hall only here tran&s;iently ob|&s;erve, that &s;ome efforts to emerge from bar|barity had long before this time appeared in Italy. Dante wrote his &s;ublime <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly the beginning of the third Canto of the INFERNO, as al&s;o the beginning of the &s;ixth.</NOTE> and origi|nal poem, which is a kind of &s;atirical epic, and which abounds in images and &s;enti|ments equal to the be&s;t of Homer, but who&s;e works he had never &s;een, about the year 1310. Giotto the di&s;ciple of Cimabue, the friend of Dante, and &s;ubject of his prai&s;es, was employed, about the &s;ame time, by Benedict XI.; and a picture of mo&s;aic work done by him, over the gate of St. Peter's church at Rome, is &s;till remaining. A Tu&s;can, called Guy of Arezzo, invented the mu&s;ical notes in u&s;e at pre&s;ent: and Brunele&s;chi built palaces at Florence, in the &s;tyle of ancient architecture. Soon afterwards, Boccace and Petrarch poli&s;hed, and fixed the &s;tandard of the Italian language. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Veggiamo in un mede&s;imo progre&s;&s;o di tempo (dal regno principalmente dell'una, e dell'altra Sicilia, e poi dalla Lom|bardia, e de vari, e di&s;tinti luoghi d'Italia) &s;orgere &s;crittori, i quali anno favella con Dante, Petrarcha, Boccacio, ed altri To&s;cani autori commune, e con loro anche commune l'autorit&agrave;, da ogni regolator della lingua ricono&s;ciuta, i quali, tra molti altri, furrono Guidotto Bologne&s;e, Marco Polo Veneziano, Pier Cre&s;cenzia da Bologna, Guido Giudice Me&s;&s;ine&s;e, Giacopo Colonna Romano, Federico II. imperadore, Pier delle Vigne Capoano, Benvenuto da Imola, Fra Jacopone da Todi, One&s;to Bologne&s;e, Guido Gui&s;lieri, Semprebene, Fabrovio, Guido Gui&s;lieri, Jacopo della Lana, Giotto Mantovano." <BIBL>Gravina della Rag.

friend&s;hip of the duke of Buckingham: who, in his ESSAY here alluded to, has fol|lowed the method of Boileau, in di&s;cour&s;ing on the various &s;pecies of poetry, to no other purpo&s;e than to manife&s;t his own inferiority. The piece is, indeed, of the &s;atyric, rather than of the preceptive, kind. The coldne&s;s and neglect with which this writer, formed only on the French critics, &s;peaks of Milton, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as proofs of his want of critical di&s;cernment, or of critical courage. I can recollect no performance of Buck|ingham, that &s;tamps him a true genius. His reputation was owing to his rank.

<P>AN ESSAY on Tran&s;lated Ver&s;e &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight to be a barren &s;ubject; yet Ro&s;|common has decorated it with may precepts of utility and ta&s;te, and enlivened it with a tale in imitation of Boileau. It is indi&s;putably better written than the la&s;t-mentioned ESSAY. Ro&s;common was more learned than Buck|ingham. He was bred under Bochart at Caen in Normandy. He had laid a de&s;ign of forming a &s;ociety for the refining, and fixing the &s;tandard of, our language: in which project, his intimate friend Dryden was a principal a&s;&s;i&s;tant.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 730.</NOTE></L></Q> 
<P>IF POPE has here given too magnificent an elogy to Wal&s;h, it mu&s;t pardonably be attri|buted to friend&s;hip, rather than to judgment. Wal&s;h was in general a flimzy and frigid writer. The Rambler calls his works PAGES OF INANITY. His three letters to POPE, however, are well written. His remarks on the nature of pa&s;toral poetry, on borrowing from the ancients, and again&s;t florid conceits, are worthy peru&s;al<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 7. pag. 65, &amp;c.</NOTE>. POPE owed much to Wal&s;h: it was he who gave him a very im|portant piece of advice, in his early youth; for he u&s;ed to tell our author, that there was one way &s;till left open for him, by which he might excell any of his predece&s;&s;ors, which was, by CORRECTNESS; that though indeed we had &s;everal great poets, we as yet could boa&s;t of none that were perfectly CORRECT; and that therefore, he advi&s;ed him to make this quality his particular &s;tudy.</P> 
<P><PB N="202" REF="213">
CORRECTNESS is a vague term, frequently u&s;ed without meaning and preci&s;ion. It is per|petually the nau&s;eous cant of the French cri|tics, and of their advocates and pupils, that the Engli&s;h writers are generally INCORRECT. If CORRECTNESS implies an ab&s;ence of petty faults, this perhaps may be granted. If it means, that becau&s;e their tragedians have avoided the irregularities of Shake&s;peare, and have ob&s;erved a ju&s;ter oeconomy in their fables, that therefore the Athalia, for in&s;tance, is preferable to Lear, the notion is groundle&s;s and ab&s;urd. The Henriade is free from any very gro&s;s faults; but who will dare to rank it with the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t? The declamations with which &s;ome of their mo&s;t perfect trage|dies abound, may be reckoned as contrary to the nature of that &s;pecies of poetry, and as de&s;tructive of it's end, as the fools or grave|diggers of Shake&s;peare. That the French may boa&s;t &s;ome excellent critics, particularly, Bo&s;&s;u, Boileau, Fenelon, and Brumoy, cannot be denied; but that they are &s;ufficient to form a ta&s;te upon, without having recour&s;e to the
<PB N="203" REF="214">
genuine fountains of all polite literature, I mean the Grecian writers, no one but a &s;uper|ficial &s;cioli&s;t can allow.</P></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I CONCLUDE the&s;e reflections with a remark|able fact. In no poli&s;hed nation, after critici&s;m has been much &s;tudied, and the rules of wri|ting e&s;tabli&s;hed, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has vi&s;ibly been the ca&s;e, in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Ari&s;totle, Horace, and Boileau, had writ|ten their ARTS OF POETRY. In our own country, the rules of the drama, for in&s;tance, were never more completely under&s;tood than at pre&s;ent: yet what UNINTERESTING, though FAULTLESS, tragedies, have we lately &s;een? So much better is our judgment than our exe|cution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, adequately and ju&s;tly, would be attended with all tho&s;e difficulties that await di&s;cu&s;&s;ions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and &s;ecret cau&s;es that influence them. Whether or no, the natural powers be not confined and debi|litated
<PB N="204" REF="215">
by that timidity and caution which is occa&s;ioned by a regard to the dictates of art: or whether, that philo&s;ophical, that geome|trical, and &s;y&s;tematical &s;pirit &s;o much in vogue, which has &s;pread it&s;elf from the &s;ciences even into polite literature, by con&s;ulting only REASON, has not dimini&s;hed and de&s;troyed SENTIMENT; and made our poets write from and to the HEAD rather than the HEART: or whether, la&s;tly, when ju&s;t models, from which the rules have nece&s;&s;arily been drawn, have once appeared, &s;ucceeding writers, by ambitiou&s;ly endeavouring to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e ju&s;t models, and to be original and new, do not become di&s;torted and unnatural, in their thoughts and diction.</P>

<P>IF the Moderns have excelled the Ancients in any &s;pecies of writing, it &s;eems to be in &s;atire: and, particularly in that kind of &s;atire, which is conveyed in the form of the epopee, a plea&s;ing vehicle of &s;atire never u&s;ed by the ancients. As the poet di&s;appears in this way of writing, and does not deliver the intended cen&s;ure in his own proper per&s;on, the &s;atire becomes more delicate, becau&s;e more oblique. Add to this, that a tale or &s;tory more &s;trongly engages and intere&s;ts the reader, than a &s;eries of precepts or reproofs, or even of characters them&s;elves, however lively and natural. An heroi-comic poem may there|fore be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t excellent kind of &s;atire.</P>

Boileau him|&s;elf has given a circum&s;tantial account of what gave occa&s;ion to this poem; which account, becau&s;e it is entertaining, and not printed in the common editions of his works, I will in&s;ert at length. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not here act like Ario&s;to, who frequently when he is going to relate the mo&s;t ab&s;urd &s;tory in the world, &s;olemnly prote&s;ts it to be true, and &s;upports it by the authority of archbi&s;hop Turpin. For my part I freely declare, the whole poem of the DESK is nothing but pure fiction; that it is all invented, even to the name it&s;elf of the place where the action pa&s;&s;es. An odd occa&s;ion gave ri&s;e to this poem. In a company I was lately engaged in, the conver|&s;ation turned upon epic poetry: every one delivered his opinion, according to his abili|ties; when mine was a&s;ked, I confirmed
<PB N="209" REF="220">
what I had advanced in my Art of Poetry, that an heroic poem, to be truly excellent, ought to be charged with little MATTER, which it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of invention to &s;upport and extend. The opinion was warmly conte&s;ted: but after many rea&s;ons for and again&s;t, it happened, as it generally does in this &s;ort of di&s;putes, that nobody was con|vinced, and that each continued in his own opinion. The heat of di&s;pute being over, we talked on other &s;ubjects; and laughed at the violence into which we had been betrayed, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a que&s;tion of &s;o little con&s;equence. We moralized on the folly of men who pa&s;s almo&s;t their whole lives, in treating the greate&s;t trifles in a &s;erious manner, and in making to them&s;elves an important affair of &s;omething quite indifferent. To this purpo&s;e, a country gentleman related a famous quarrel, that had lately happened in a little church in his province, between the trea&s;urer and the chantor, the two principal dignitaries of that church, about the place in which a reading|de&s;k was to &s;tand. We thought it a droll
<PB N="210" REF="221">
affair. Upon this, one of the critics in com|pany, who could not &s;o &s;oon forget our late di&s;pute, a&s;ked me, if I, who thought &s;o little MATTER nece&s;&s;ary for an heroic poem, would undertake to write one on a quarrel &s;o little abounding in incidents, as this of the two eccle&s;ia&s;tics. <Q REND="inline">"J'eus plut&ocirc;t dit, pourquoi non? que je n'eus fait reflexion &s;ur ce qu'il me demandoit."</Q> This made the company laugh, and I could not help laughing with them; not in the lea&s;t imagining, that I &s;hould ever be able to keep my word. But finding my&s;elf at lei&s;ure in the evening, I re|volved the &s;ubject in my mind, and having con&s;idered in every view the plea&s;antry that it would admit of, I made twenty ver&s;es which I &s;hewed to my friends. They were diverted with this beginning. The plea&s;ure which I &s;aw the&s;e gave them, induced me to write twenty more. Thus, from twenty ver&s;es to twenty, I lengthened the work to near nine hundred. This is the whole hi&s;tory of the trifle I now offer to the public.&mdash;This is a new kind of burle&s;que, which I have intro|duced
<PB N="211" REF="222">
into our language: for, as in the other kind of burle&s;que, that of Scarron, Dido and Aeneas &s;poke like fi&s;h-women and porters, in this of mine, a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Altered afterwards to a Barber.</NOTE> clock-maker and his wife talk like Dido and Aeneas. I do not know whether my poem will have all the qualities requi&s;ite to &s;atisfy a reader: but I dare flatter my&s;elf, that it will at lea&s;t be allowed to have the grace of novelty; becau&s;e I do not con|ceive, that there are any works of this nature in our language; the DEFAITES DES BOUTS RIMES of Sara&s;in being rather a mere allegory than a poem, as this is."</Q></P>
<P>ON a &s;ubject &s;eemingly &s;o unpromi&s;ing and incapable of ornament, has Boileau found a method of rai&s;ing a poem full of beautiful imagery; which appears like that magnificent city, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Petersburg.</NOTE> which the greate&s;t of princes cau&s;ed to be built in a mora&s;s.

<P>HIS knowledge of the rents of his church, and of the mortgages belonging to it, his &s;corn of the pious and laborious Arnauld, his contempt of learning, and, above all, his ruling pa&s;&s;ion of good-eating, are &s;trokes high|ly comic. It is wonderful the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of France were not as much irritated by the publi|cation of the LUTRIN, as by the TARTUFFE of Moliere; which was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by their in|tere&s;t, after it had been acted a few nights: although at the &s;ame time, a very profane farce was permitted to have a long run. When Louis XIV. expre&s;&s;ed to the Prince of Cond&egrave;, his wonder at the different fates of the&s;e two pieces, and a&s;ked the rea&s;on of it, the prince an&s;wered,

<P>BOILEAU has rai&s;ed his &s;ubjects by many per&s;onifications; particularly, in the begin|ning of the &s;ixth canto, PIETY who had re|tired to the great Carthu&s;ian mona&s;tery on the Alps, is introduced as repairing to Paris, accompanied by FAITH, HOPE, and CHA|RITY, in order to make her complaint to THEMIS: to which may be added, the mon|&s;trous figure of CHICANERY, attended by FAMINE, WANT, SORROW, and RUIN, in the beginning of the fifth canto. The chief divinity that acts throughout the poem, is DISCORD; which godde&s;s is repre&s;ented as coming from a convent of Cordeliers. A fine &s;troke of &s;atire; but imitated from the &s;atyrical Ario&s;to, who makes Michael find DISCORD in a cloi&s;ter, in&s;tead of SILENCE, whom he there &s;earched for in vain. NIGHT is al&s;o introduced as an actre&s;s with great propriety, in the third canto; where &s;he repairs to the
<PB N="216" REF="227">
famous old tower at Montlery, in order to find out an owl which &s;he may convey into the DESK, and which afterwards produces &s;o ridiculous a con&s;ternation.

occa&s;ioned by a little piece of gallantry of Lord Petre, who, in a party of plea&s;ure, found means to cut off a favorite lock of Mrs. Arabella Fermour's hair. POPE was de&s;ired to write it, in order to put an end to the quarrel it produced, by Mr. Caryl, who had been &s;ecretary to queen Mary, author of Sir Solomon Single a comedy, and of &s;ome tran&s;lations in Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies. POPE was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"What I wrote fa&s;te&s;t always plea&s;ed mo&s;t."</Q> The fir&s;t &s;ketch of this exqui&s;ite piece, which Addi&s;on called MERUM SAL, was written in le&s;s than a fortnight, in two cantos only: but it was &s;o univer&s;ally applauded, that, in the next year, our poet enriched it with the machinery of the &s;ylphs, and extended it to five cantos; when it was printed with a letter to Mrs. Fer|mour, far &s;uperior to any of Voiture. The in&s;ertion of the machinery of the &s;ylphs in proper places, without the lea&s;t appearance of it's being aukwardly &s;titched in, is one of the happie&s;t efforts of judgment and art. He took the idea of the&s;e invi&s;ible beings, &s;o pro|per
<PB N="220" REF="231">
to be employed in a poem of this nature, from a little french book entitled, Le Comte de Gabalis, of which I have lately met with an account, in an entertaining writer. <Q REND="inline">"The Abbe Villars, who came from Thoulou&s;e to Paris, to make his fortune by preaching, is the author of this diverting work. The five dialogues of which it con&s;i&s;ts, are the re&s;ult of tho&s;e gay conver&s;ations, in which the Abbe was engaged &aacute; la porte de Richelieu, with a &s;et of men, of fine wit and humour, like him&s;elf. When this book fir&s;t appeared, it was univer&s;ally read, as innocent and amu&s;ing. But at length, it's con&s;equences were perceived, and reckoned dangerous, at a time when this &s;ort of curio&s;ities began to gain credit. Our devout preacher was denied the chair, and his book forbidden to be read. It was not clear whether the author intended to be ironical, or &s;poke all &s;eriou&s;ly. The &s;econd volume which he promi&s;ed, would have decided the que|&s;tion: but the unfortunate Abbe was &s;oon after|wards a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by ruffians, on the road to Lyons. The laughers gave out, that the

It may be ob&s;erved in general, to the honour of the poets, both ancient and modern, that they have ever been &s;ome of the fir&s;t, who have detected and oppo&s;ed the fal&s;e claims, and mi&s;chievous u&s;urpations, of &s;uper&s;tition and &s;lavery.

<P>THE denouement, as a pedantic di&s;ciple of Bo&s;&s;u would call it, of this poem, is well con|ducted. What is become of this important LOCK OF HAIR? It is made a con&s;tellation with that of Berenice, &s;o celebrated by Cal|limachus. As it ri&s;es to heaven,

One cannot &s;ufficiently applaud the art of the poet, in con&s;tantly keeping in the reader's view, the machinery of the poem, to the very la&s;t. Even when the Lock is transformed, the &s;ylphs, who had &s;o carefully guarded it, are here once again artfully mentioned, as finally rejoicing in it's honourable transfor|mation.</P>
<P>IN reading the Lutrin, I have always been &s;truck with the impropriety of &s;o &s;erious a conclu&s;ion, as Boileau has given to &s;o ludi|crous a poem. PIETY and JUSTICE are beings rather too awful, to have any concern in the celebrated de&s;k. They appear as much out of place and &s;ea&s;on, as would the arch|bi&s;hop of Paris in his pontifical robes, in an harlequin entertainment.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of The ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, The PROLOGUE
to Cato, and The EPI|LOGUE to Jane Shore.</HEAD>
<P>THE ELEGY <HI>to the Memory of an Unfor|tunate Lady,</HI> which is next to be &s;po|ken of, as it came from the heart, is very tender and pathetic; more &s;o, I think, than any other copy of ver&s;es of our author. We are unacquainted with her hi&s;tory, and with that &s;eries of misfortunes, which &s;eems to have drawn on the melancholy cata&s;trophe, alluded to in the beginning of this ELEGY. She is &s;aid to be the &s;ame per&s;on, to whom the Duke of Buckingham has addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome lines, viz. <Q REND="inline">"To a Lady de&s;igning to retire into a Mona&s;tery."</Q> This de&s;ign is al&s;o hinted at in POPE's Letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. vii.

<PB N="250" REF="261">
afford it, I believe your de&s;ign will be vain: for even, in a mona&s;tery, your devotions cannot carry you &s;o far towards the next world, as to make this lo&s;e &s;ight of you: but you will be like a &s;tar, that, while it is fixed in hea|ven, &s;hines over all the earth. Where&s;oever providence &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of the mo&s;t valuable thing I know, I &s;hall ever follow you with my &s;incere&s;t wi&s;hes; and my be&s;t thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you, when you never hear of me or them.

<Q><L>Thus, if eternal ju&s;tice rules the ball,</L>
<L>Thus &s;hall your wives, and thus your children fall.</L></Q>
He de&s;cribes afterwards the de&s;olation of this family, by the following lively circum&s;tance and pro&s;opopoeia:<Q><PB N="252" REF="263">

<P>THE PROLOGUE to <HI>Addi&s;on's Tragedy of Cato,</HI> is &s;uperiour to any prologue of Dryden; who, notwith&s;tanding, is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for this &s;pecies of writing. The prologues of Dryden are &s;atyrical and facetious; this of POPE is &s;olemn and &s;ublime, as the &s;ubject
<PB N="258" REF="269">
required. Tho&s;e of Dryden contain general topics of critici&s;m and wit, and may pre|cede any play what&s;oever, even tragedy or comedy. This of POPE is particular, and appropriated to the tragedy alone, which it was de&s;igned to introduce. The mo&s;t &s;triking images and allu&s;ions it contains, are taken, with judgment, from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the life of Cato him&s;elf. Such is that fine &s;troke, more lofty than any thing in the tragedy it&s;elf, where the poet &s;ays, that when Cae&s;ar amid the pomp and magnificence of a triumph,<Q><L>Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in &s;tate;</L>
<L>As her dead father's reverend image pa&s;t,</L>

<L>And honour'd Cae&s;ar's le&s;s than Cato's &s;word.</L></Q> Such, again, is the happy allu&s;ion to an old &s;tory mentioned in Martial, of this &s;age going into the theatre, and immediately com|ing out of it again:
<Q><L>Such plays alone &s;hould win a Briti&s;h ear,</L>

<PB N="259" REF="270">
From which he draws an artful panegyric, on the purity and excellence of the play he was celebrating.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to &s;prightly turns and poig|nancy of wit, the prologues of Dryden have not been equalled. The curious reader may con&s;ult, particularly, a collection of twenty of them together, in the fir&s;t edition of the fir&s;t volume of Ton&s;on's Mi&s;cellanies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 263.</NOTE>; many of them, and the mo&s;t excellent, written on occa&s;ion of the players going to Oxford; a cu&s;tom, for the neglect of which, no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned; except, perhaps, that even the players mu&s;t now for&s;ooth follow the contemptible cant of decrying that mo&s;t learned univer&s;ity, and of doing nothing that may contribute to its plea&s;ure and emolument. At this time Dryden was &s;o famous for his prologues, that no piece was reli&s;hed, nor would the theatres &s;carcely venture to produce it, if it wanted this fa&s;hionable ornament. To this purpo&s;e, an anecdote is recorded of
<PB N="260" REF="271">
Southerne; who, on bringing his fir&s;t play on the &s;tage, did not fail to be&s;peak a pro|logue of the arti&s;t in vogue. The u&s;ual price had ever been four guineas. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, Dryden in&s;i&s;ted that he mu&s;t have &s;ix for his work; <Q REND="inline">"which, &s;aid the mercantile bard, is out of no di&s;re&s;pect to you, young man; but the players have had my goods too cheap."</Q></P>
<P>THE tragedy of Cato it&s;elf, is a glaring in|&s;tance of the force of party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Addi&s;on &s;poke of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate at that time, he always called him, in the language of Shake&s;peare, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That canker'd Bolingbroke.</HI>"</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this, Addi&s;on a&s;&s;ured POPE he did not bring his tragedy on the &s;tage with any party views; nay, de&s;ired POPE to carry the poem to the Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke, for their peru&s;al. The play, however, was always con&s;idered as a warning to the people, that liberty was in danger during that tory mini&s;try. To obviate the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, that &s;o popular a performance might make on the minds of the audience, Lord Bolingbroke, in the mid&s;t of their violent applau&s;es, &s;ent for Booth, who played Cato, one night, into his box, between the acts, and pre&s;ented him with fifty guineas; in acknowledgment, as he expre&s;&s;ed it with great addre&s;s, for defending the cau&s;e of liberty &s;o well again&s;t a perpetual dictator.</NOTE>; &s;o heavy and declamatory a drama would never have met with &s;uch rapid and amazing &s;ucce&s;s, if every
<PB N="261" REF="272">
line and &s;entiment had not been particularly tortured, and applied, to recent events, and the reigning di&s;putes of the times. The purity and energy of the diction, and the loftine&s;s of the &s;entiments, copied in a great mea&s;ure from Lucan, Tacitus, and Seneca the phi|lo&s;opher, merit approbation. But I have always thought, that tho&s;e pompous Roman &s;entiments are not &s;o difficult to be produced, as is vulgarly imagined; and which, indeed, dazzle only the vulgar. A &s;troke of nature is, in my opinion, worth a hundred &s;uch thoughts, as,
<Q><L>When vice prevails, and impious men bear &s;way,</L>
<L>The po&s;t of honour is a private &s;tation.</L></Q>
CATO is a fine dialogue on liberty, and the love of one's country; but con&s;idered as a dramatic performance, nay as a model of a ju&s;t tragedy, as &s;ome have affectedly repre|&s;ented it, it mu&s;t be owned to want, ACTION and PATHOS; the two hinges, I pre&s;ume, on which a ju&s;t tragedy ought nece&s;&s;arily to turn, and without which it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.

his imitation of the Ore&s;tes of Sophocles, Crebillon has introduced a frigid
love-intrigue. Achilles mu&s;t be in love in the Iphigenia of Racine; and the
rough Mithridates mu&s;t be involved in this all-&s;ubduing pa&s;&s;ion. A

boldly, perhaps, ventured to deliver on the <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;ed</HI> poetry of Addi&s;on, yet mu&s;t we candidly own, that in various parts of his pro&s;e-e&s;&s;ays, are to be found many &s;trokes of genuine and &s;ublime poetry; many marks of a vigorous and exuberant imagination. Particularly, in the noble allegory of Pain and Plea&s;ure, the Vi&s;ion of Mirza, the &s;tory of Maraton and Yaratilda, of Con&s;tantia and Theodo&s;ius, and the beautiful ea&s;tern tale of Abdallah and Bal&s;ora; and many others: together with &s;everal &s;trokes in the E&s;&s;ay on the plea&s;ures of imagination.

<P>THE EPILOGUE <HI>to Jane Shore,</HI> is the la&s;t piece that belongs to this Section; the title of which by this time the reader may have po&s;&s;ibly forgot.

To recommend cuckoldom and palliate adultery, is their u&s;ual intent. I wonder Mrs. Oldfield was not &s;uffered to &s;peak it; for it is &s;uperiour to that which was u&s;ed on the oc|ca&s;ion.

compo&s;itions &s;ooth us with a tranquill and tender &s;ort of com|placency,
rather than cleave the heart with
<PB N="273" REF="284"> pangs of
commi&s;eration. His di&s;tre&s;&s;es are entirely founded on the pa&s;&s;ion
of love. His diction is extremely elegant and cha&s;te, and his ver&s;ification
highly melodious. His plays are declamations, rather than dialogues, and his
characters are general, and undi&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. Such a furious
character as that of Bajazet, is ea&s;ily drawn; and, let me add, ea&s;ily
acted. There is a want of unity in the fable of Tamerlane. The death's head,
dead body, and &s;tage hung in mourning, in the Fair Penitent, are inartificial
and mecha|nical methods of affecting an audience. In a word, his plays are
mu&s;ical and plea&s;ing poems, but inactive and unmoving trage|dies. This of
Jane Shore is, I think, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and affecting of any he has
given us: but probability is &s;adly violated in it by the neglect of the unity
of time. For a per|&s;on to be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;tarved, during the
repre&s;entation of five acts, is a &s;triking in|&s;tance of the ab&s;urdity

<P>IT is probable, that this is become the mo&s;t popular and plea&s;ing tragedy of all Rowe's works, becau&s;e it is founded on our own hi|&s;tory. It is to be wi&s;hed, that our writers would more frequently &s;earch for &s;ubjects, in the annals of England, which afford many &s;triking and pathetic events, proper for the &s;tage. We have been too long attached to Grecian and Roman &s;tories. In truth, the DOMESTICA FACTA, are more intere&s;ting, as well as more u&s;eful: more intere&s;ting, be|cau&s;e

The Turks, the Per&s;ians, and Americans, of our poets, are in reality di&s;tingui&s;hed from Engli&s;hmen, only by their turbans and feathers; and think, and act, as if they were born and edu|cated within the bills of mortality.

<P>IT is not impertinent to ob&s;erve, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are fond of the hi&s;tory, of literature, and of the human mind in the pro|gre&s;s of it, that the very fir&s;t poem that ap|peared in France, any thing like an epic poem, was on this identical &s;ubject, of Brutus ar|riving in England. It was written by Ma|&s;ter EUSTACHE, &s;o early as in the reign of Louis the &s;eventh, &s;irnamed the Young, who a&s;cended the throne in the year 1137, and who was the hu&s;band of the celebrated Ele|onora, afterwards divorced, and married to our Henry the &s;econd. The author called it, Le ROMAN de Brut. Every piece of poetry was at that time denominated a romance. The latin language cea&s;ed to be regularly &s;poken in France, about the ninth century; and was &s;ucceeded by what was called the <HI>Romance</HI>-tongue, a mixture of the language
<PB N="283" REF="294">
of the Francs, and of bad Latin. The &s;pecies of writing, called <HI>Romans,</HI> began in the tenth century, according to the opinion of the Be|nedictine fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Lit. T. 6, 7.</NOTE>, who have well refuted, M. Fleuri and Calmet, who make them le&s;s ancient by two hundred years. The poem, or <HI>Roman,</HI> we are &s;peaking of, is full of won|derful and improbable tales, and &s;upernatural adventures, &s;uited to the ta&s;te of &s;o barbarous an age. It is matter of &s;ome curio&s;ity, to &s;ee a &s;pecimen of the &s;tyle of this elde&s;t of the French poets. This is his exordium:<Q><L>Qui veut ouir, qui veut &s;cavoir,</L>
<L>De roi en roi, &amp; d'hoir en hoir,</L>
<L>Qui cils furent, &amp; d'o&ugrave; cils vinrent,</L>
<L>Qui Angleterre primes tinrent.</L></Q> We may judge, from this pa&s;&s;age, of the &s;tate of the language. Ma&s;ter Eu&s;tache has been particularly careful to mark the time in which he lived and wrote, by his two concluding lines:
<Q><L>L'an mil cent cinquante&mdash;cinq ans</L>
<L>Fit Mai&s;tre Eu&s;tache ces Romans.</L></Q>
<PB N="284" REF="295">
I will take leave to add, that the &s;econd poem now remaining in the French language, was entitled, The Romance of Alexander the Great. It was the confederated work of four authors, famous in their time. Lambert le Court, and Alexander of Paris, &s;ung the ex|ploits of Alexander; Peter de Saint Clo&s;t, wrote his will in ver&s;e; the writing the will of a hero being then a common topic; and John le Nivelois, added a book concerning the manner in which his death was revenged. It is remarkable, that before this time, all the <HI>Romans</HI> had been compo&s;ed in ver&s;es of eight &s;yllables: but in this piece, the four authors fir&s;t u&s;ed ver&s;es of TWELVE &s;yllables, as more &s;olemn and maje&s;tic. And this was the origin, tho' but little known, of tho&s;e ver&s;es, which we now call ALEXANDRINES; the French heroic mea&s;ure: the name being derived from Alexander, the hero of the piece, or from Alexander, the mo&s;t celebrated of the four poets concerned in this work. The&s;e were the mo&s;t applauded poets of that age. Fauchet highly commends this poem: par|ticularly

<P>IT is no &s;mall merit in Ovid, to have in|vented this beautiful &s;pecies of writing epi&s;tles under feigned characters. It is a high improvement on the Greek elegy; to which its dramatic nature renders it greatly &s;uperior. It is indeed no other than a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;olilo|quy; in which, the mind gives vent to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and emotions under which it la|bours: but by being directed and addre&s;&s;ed to a particular per&s;on, it gains a degree of propriety, that the be&s;t-conducted &s;oliloquy, in a tragedy, mu&s;t ever want. Our impatience under any pre&s;&s;ures of grief, and di&s;order of mind, makes &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate expo&s;tulations with the per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to cau&s;e &s;uch un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es, very natural. Judgment is chiefly &s;hewn, by opening the intere&s;ting complaint ju&s;t at &s;uch a period of time, as will give oc|ca&s;ion

for the mo&s;t tender &s;entiments, and the mo&s;t &s;udden and violent turns of pa&s;&s;ion to be di&s;played. Ovid may, perhaps, be blamed for a &s;amene&s;s of &s;ubjects, in the&s;e epi&s;tles of his heroines; who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es are almo&s;t all occa&s;ioned by their lovers for&s;aking them. His epi&s;tles are likewi&s;e too long; which circum&s;tance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the &s;entiments. It would be a plea&s;ing ta&s;k, and conduce to the formation of a good ta&s;te, to &s;hew how differently Ovid and the Greek tragedians, have made Medea, Phaedra, and Deianira &s;peak, on the very &s;ame occa&s;ions. Such a compari&s;on would abun|dantly manife&s;t, the FANCY and WIT of Ovid, and the JUDGMENT and NATURE of Euripides and Sophocles. If the character of Medea was not better &s;upported in the tragedy, which Ovid is &s;aid to have produced, and of which Quintilian &s;peaks &s;o advantageou&s;ly, than it is in her epi&s;tle to Ja&s;on, one may venture to declare, that, if this drama had &s;urvived, the Ro|mans would not yet have been vindicated, from their inferiority to the Greeks, in tragic poe&s;y.</P>

THE EPISTLE before us is tran&s;lated by POPE, with faithfulne&s;s and with elegance; and much excells any that Dryden tran&s;lated in the volume he publi&s;hed: many of which were done by &s;ome <Q REND="inline">"of the mob of gentle|men that wrote with ea&s;e;"</Q> that is, Sir C.

The inability of the French tongue to expre&s;s many Greek or Roman ideas with facility and grace, is here vi&s;ible: but the Italians have Horace tran&s;lated by Pallavacini, Theocritus by Ricolotti, Ovid by Anguillara, the Aeneid, admirably well, in blank ver&s;e, by

<P>I return to Ovid, by ob&s;erving, that he has put into the mouth of his heroine, a greater number of pretty panegyrical epigrams, than of tho&s;e tender and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;entiments, which &s;uited her character, and made her SENSIBILITY in amours &s;o famous.

<L>No pul&s;e that riots, and no blood that glows.</L></Q> Here Eloi&s;a glances with great mode&s;ty and delicacy, at the irreparable misfortune of her mutilated hu&s;band, which however &s;he always mentions with regret.

ca&s;trated, and in that condition, &s;ent them back to the Greek general, with orders to tell him, that he had done it to oblige the emperor, whom he knew to be a lover of eunuchs; and that he would endeavour to &s;end him, in a &s;hort time, a much greater number of them. The Marquis was preparing to be as good as his word, when one day a woman, who&s;e hu&s;band had been taken pri&s;oner, came all in tears to the camp, and begged to &s;peak to Thedbald. The Marquis having a&s;ked her the cau&s;e of her grief, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, I wonder that &s;uch a valiant hero as you &s;hould trifle away your time in warring with women, when men are unable to re&s;i&s;t you. Thed|bald replied, that, &s;ince the days of the Ama|zons, he had never heard that war had been made upon women. My Lord, an&s;wered the Greek woman, can a crueller be made upon us, than to deprive our hu&s;bands of what gives us health, plea&s;ure, and children? When you make eunuchs of them, it is mutilating us, not them: you have lately taken away our cattle and goods, without any complaint

from me: but this being an irreparable lo&s;s to &s;everal of my neighbours, I could not avoid imploring the compa&s;&s;ion of the conqueror. The whole army was &s;o plea&s;ed with this woman's ingenuous declaration, that they re|&s;tored her hu&s;band to her, and all they had taken from her. As &s;he was going away, Thedbald a&s;ked her, what &s;he would be will|ing &s;hould be done to her hu&s;band, if he was found in arms again. He has eyes, &s;aid &s;he, a no&s;e, hands, and feet: the&s;e are his OWN, which you may take from HIM if he de&s;erves it; but leave him, if you plea&s;e, what be|longs to ME."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bibliotheque Univer&s;elle, Tom. 11. p. 10.</NOTE></Q></P>

<P>I BELIEVE few per&s;ons have ever been pre|&s;ent at the celebrating a ma&s;s in a good choir,
<PB N="326" REF="337">
but have been extremely affected with awe, if not with devotion; which ought to put us on our guard, again&s;t the in&s;inuating nature of &s;o pompous and alluring a religion as popery. Lord Bolingbroke being one day pre&s;ent at this &s;olemnity, in the chapel at Ver&s;ailles, and &s;eeing the archbi&s;hop of Paris elevate the ho&s;t, whi&s;pered his companion the Marquis de *****, <Q REND="inline">"If I were king of France, I would always perform this ceremony my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>ELOISA now acknowledges the weakne&s;s of her religious efforts, and gives her&s;elf up to the prevalence of her pa&s;&s;ion.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 280.</NOTE> Come with one glance of tho&s;e

<L>Blot out each bright idea of the &s;kies;</L>

<L>Snatch me ju&s;t mounting, from the ble&s;t abode,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;i&s;t the fiends, and tear me from my God!</L></Q> Suddenly, religion ru&s;hes back on her mind, and &s;he exclaims eagerly,<Q><PB N="327" REF="338">
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 300.</NOTE> No fly me, fly me! far as pole to

<L>Ah, <HI>come</HI> not, <HI>write</HI> not, <HI>think</HI> not once of

<L>Nor &s;hare one pang of all I felt for thee.</L>
<L>Thy oaths I quit, thy memory re&s;ign,</L>
<L>Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.</L></Q> This change is judicious and moving. And the following invocation to hope, faith, and chri&s;tian grace, to come and take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;oul, is &s;olemn, and &s;uited to the con|dition of her mind; for it &s;eems to be the poet's intention to &s;hew the force of religion over pa&s;&s;ion at la&s;t, and to repre&s;ent her as a little calm and re&s;igned to her de&s;tiny, and way of life. To fix her in which holy tem|per, the circum&s;tance that follows may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute. For &s;he relates an incident to Abelard, which had made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, and cannot fail of making an equal one, on the mind of tho&s;e readers, who can reli&s;h true poetry, and &s;trong imagery. The &s;cene &s;he paints is aw|ful: &s;he repre&s;ents her&s;elf lying on a tomb,
<PB N="328" REF="339">
and thinking &s;he heard &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 308.</NOTE> &s;pirit calling to her in every low wind,&mdash;<Q><L><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Virgil may however have given the

<L>Once like thy&s;elf I trembled, wept and pray'd,
 <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is well contrived, that this invi&s;ible

misfortunes with Eloi&s;a.</NOTE></L>
<L>Love's victim then, but now a &s;ainted maid.</L></Q> This &s;cene would make a fine &s;ubject for the pencil; and is worthy a capital painter. He might place Eloi&s;a in the long ile of a great Gothic church; a lamp &s;hould hang over her head, who&s;e dim and di&s;mal ray &s;hould afford only light enough to make darkne&s;s vi&s;ible. She her&s;elf &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the <HI>in|&s;tant,</HI> when &s;he fir&s;t hears this a&euml;rial voice, and in the attitude of <HI>&s;tarting round</HI> with a&s;toni&s;hment and fear. And this was the
<PB N="329" REF="340">
method a very great ma&s;ter took, <HI>to paint a &s;ound,</HI> if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion. This &s;ubject was the bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and in order to bring into this &s;ubject the re|markable incident of the voice from heaven, which cried aloud, <Q REND="inline">"This is my beloved &s;on,"</Q> he repre&s;ented all the a&s;&s;embly that attended on the banks of Jordan, gazing up into heaven, with the utmo&s;t ardor of amaze|ment.</P>
<P>AT this call of a &s;i&s;ter in misfortune, who had been vi&s;ited with a &s;ad &s;imilitude of griefs with her own, Eloi&s;a breaks out in a religious tran&s;port,<Q><L>I come, I come! prepare your ro&s;eate bow'rs,</L>
<L>Coele&s;tial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs;</L>
<L>Thither where <HI>&s;inners</HI> may have re&s;t I go!</L></Q> She then calls on Abelard, to pay her the la&s;t &s;ad offices; and to be pre&s;ent with her in the article of death,
<Q><L>See my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll&mdash;</L></Q>
And then a circum&s;tance of per&s;onal fondne&s;s intervenes,
<Q><PB N="330" REF="341">
<L><HI>Suck</HI> my la&s;t breath, and catch the flying &s;oul!</L></Q>
But &s;he in&s;tantly corrects her&s;elf, and would have her Abelard attend her at the&s;e la&s;t &s;olemn moments, only as a devout prie&s;t, and not as a fond lover. The image, in which &s;he repre&s;ents him coming to admini&s;ter ex|treme unction, is &s;triking and picture&s;que;<Q><L>Ah no&mdash;in &s;acred ve&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">nts may&s;t thou &s;tand,</L>
<L>The hallow'd taper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words printed in Italics,

thy hand,</L>
<L><HI>Pre&s;ent</HI> the cro&s;s before my <HI>lifted</HI> eye,</L>
<L>Teach me at once, and learn of me, to die!</L></Q> She adds, that it will be <HI>&s;ome</HI> con&s;olation to behold him once more, tho' even in the ago|nies of death,
<Q><L>Ah then! thy once-lov'd Eloi&s;a &s;ee!</L>
<L>It will be <HI>then</HI> no crime to <HI>gaze</HI> on me!</L></Q>
Which la&s;t line I could never read without great emotion; it is at once &s;o pathetic, and &s;o artfully points back to the whole train and nature of their misfortunes. The cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="331" REF="342">
&s;he wi&s;hes may attend the death of Abelard, are poetically imagined, and are al&s;o agreeable to the notions of my&s;tic devo|tion. The death of St. Jerome is finely pain|ted by DOMENICHINO, with &s;uch attendant particulars.<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 340.</NOTE> In trance ec&s;tatic may thy pangs

<L>And &s;aints embrace thee with a love like mine.</L>
<L>May one kind grave unite each haple&s;s name,</L>
<L>And graft my love immortal on thy fame!</L></Q> This wi&s;h was fulfilled. The body of Abe|lard, who died twenty years before Eloi&s;a, was &s;ent to Eloi&s;a, who interred it in the mona|&s;tery of the Paraclete, and it was accompa|nied with a very extraordinary form of Ab&s;o|lution, from the famous Peter de Clugny; <Q REND="inline">"Ego Petrus Cluniacen&s;is abbas, qui Petrum Abelardum in monachum Cluniacen&s;em re|cepi, &amp; corpus ejus furtim delatum Heloi&s;&s;ae Abbati&s;&s;ae, &amp; monialibus Paracleti conce&s;&s;i,

In certain ages, opinions have prevailed, for which no &s;olid rea&s;on can be given."</Q> When Eloi&s;a died in 1163, &s;he was interred by the &s;ide of her beloved hu&s;band: I mu&s;t not forget to mention, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are fond of miracles, that when &s;he was put into the grave, Abelard &s;tretched out his arms to re|ceive her, and clo&s;ely embraced her.</P>
<P>ELOISA, at the conclu&s;ion of the EPISTLE to which we are now arrived, is judiciou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented as gradually &s;ettling into a tranquillity of mind, and &s;eemingly reconciled to her fate.

<P>THIS EPISTLE, is, on the whole, one of the mo&s;t highly fini&s;hed, and certainly the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, of the pieces of our author; and, together with the ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, is the only in&s;tance of the Pathetic POPE has given us. I think
<PB N="334" REF="345">
one may venture to remark, that the reputa|tion of POPE, as a poet, among po&s;terity, will be principally owing to his WINDSOR|FOREST, his RAPE OF THE LOCK, and his ELOISA TO ABELARD; whil&s;t the facts and characters alluded to and expo&s;ed, in his later writings, will be forgotten and un|known, and their poignancy and propriety little reli&s;hed.
