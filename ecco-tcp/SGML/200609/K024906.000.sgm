<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO SIR WILLIAM TRUMBALL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>First in these fields I try the sylvan strains,</L>
<L>Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains:</L>
<L>Fair Thames! flow gently from thy sacred spring,</L>
<L>While on thy banks Sicilian muses sing;</L>
<L>Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play,</L>
<L>And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, that too wise for pride, too good for pow'r,</L>
<L>Enjoy the glory to be great no more,</L>
<L>And carrying with you all the world can boast,</L>
<L>To all the world illustriously are lost!</L>
<L>O let my Muse her slender reed inspire,</L>
<L>Till in your native shades you tune the lyre:</L>
<L>So when the nightingale to rest removes,</L>
<L>The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves,</L>
<L>But charm'd to silence, listens while she sings,</L>
<L>And all th' a&euml;rial audience clap their wings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews.</L>
<L>Two swains, whom love kept wakeful, and the muse,</L>
<L>Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their &s;leecy care,</L>
<L>Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair:</L>
<L>The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side.</L>
<L>Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephon thus reply'd.</L>
</LG>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hear how the birds every blooming spray</L>
<L>With joyous music wake the dawning day!</L>
<L>Why sit we mute, when early linnets sing.</L>
<L>When warbling Philomel salutes the spring?</L>

<L>Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain,</L>
<L>While yon' slow oxen turn'd the furrow'd plain.</L>
<L>Here the bright crocus and blue vi'let glow;</L>
<L>Here western winds on breathing roses blow.</L>
<L>I'll stake yon' lamb, that near the fountain plays,</L>

<L>And I this bowl, where wanton ivy twines,</L>

<L>Inspire me, Phoebus! in my Delia's praise,</L>

<L>That threats a fight, and spurns the rising sand.</L>

<L>O Love! for Sylvia let me gain the prize,</L>

<L>Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain,</L>

<L>The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green</L>

SUMMER: OR, ALEXIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO DR. GARTH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A shepherd's boy (he seeks no better name)</L>
<L>Led forth his flocks along the silver Thame,</L>
<L>Where dancing sun-beams on the waters play'd,</L>
<L>And verdant alders form'd a quiv'ring shade.</L>
<L>Soft as he mourn'd, the streams forgot to flow,</L>
<L>The flocks around a dumb compassion show,</L>
<L>The Na&iuml;ads wept in ev'ry wat'ry bow'r,</L>
<L>And Jove consented in a silent show'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Accept, O Garth, the Muse's early lays,</L>
<L>That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays;</L>
<L>Hear what from love unpractis'd hearts endure,</L>
<L>From love, the sole disease thou canst not cure,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye shady Beeches, and ye cooling Streams,</L>
<L>Defence from Phoebus', not from Cupid's beams,</L>
<L>To you I mourn; nor to the deaf I sing,</L>
<L>The woods shall answer, and their echo ring.</L>
<L>The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay,</L>
<L>Why art thou prouder and more hard than they?</L>
<L>The bleating sheep with my complaints agree,</L>
<L>They parch'd with heat, and I inflam'd by thee,</L>
<L>The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains,</L>
<L>While in thy heart eternal Winter reigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where stray, ye Muses! in what lawn or grove,</L>
<L>While your Alexis pines in hopeless love?</L>
<L>In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides,</L>
<L>Or else where Cam his winding vales divides?</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
As in the crystal spring I view my face,</L>
<L>Fresh rising blushes paint the wat'ry glass;</L>
<L>But since those graces please thy eyes no more,</L>
<L>I shun the fountains which I sought before.</L>
<L>Once I was skill'd in ev'ry herb that grew,</L>
<L>And ev'ry plant that drinks the morning dew;</L>
<L>Ah, wretched shepherd, what avails thy art,</L>
<L>To cure thy lambs, but not to heal thy heart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let other swains attend the rural care,</L>
<L>Feed fairer flocks, or richer fleeces sheer:</L>
<L>But nigh yon' mountain let me tune my lays,</L>
<L>Embrace my love, and bind my brows with bays.</L>
<L>That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath</L>
<L>Inspir'd when living, and bequeath'd in death:</L>
<L>He said, Alexis, take this pipe, the same</L>
<L>That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name:</L>
<L>But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree,</L>
<L>For ever silent, since despis'd by thee.</L>
<L>Oh! were I made by some transforming power</L>
<L>The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r!</L>
<L>Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ</L>
<L>And I those kisses he receives enjoy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet my numbers please the rural throng,</L>
<L>Rough satyrs dance, and Pan applauds the song:</L>
<L>The nymphs, forsaking every cave and spring,</L>
<L>Their early fruit, and milk-white turtles bring!</L>
<L>Each am'rous nymph prefers her gifts in vain,</L>
<L>On you their gifts are all bestow'd again.</L>
<L>For you the swains the fairest flow'rs design,</L>
<L>And in one garland all their beauties join;</L>
<L>Accept the wreath which you deserve alone,</L>
<L>In whom all beauties are compriz'd in one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See what delights in sylvan scenes appear!</L>
<L>Descending gods have found Elysium here.</L>
<L>In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd,</L>
<L>And chaste Diana haunts the forest-shade.</L>
<L>Come, lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours,</L>
<L>When swains from sheering seek their nightly bow'rs;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
When weary reapers quit the sultry field,</L>
<L>And, crown'd with corn, their thanks to Ceres yield.</L>
<L>This harmless grove no lurking viper hides,</L>
<L>But in my breast the serpent Love abides.</L>
<L>Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew,</L>
<L>But your Alexis knows no sweets but you.</L>
<L>Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats,</L>
<L>The mossy fountains, and the green retreats!</L>
<L>Where'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade,</L>
<L>Trees, where you sit, shall croud into a shade:</L>
<L>Where'er you tread, the blushing flow'rs shall rise,</L>
<L>And all things flourish where you turn your eyes.</L>
<L>Oh! how I long with you to pass my days,</L>
<L>Invoke the Muses, and resound your praise!</L>
<L>Your praise the birds shall chant in ev'ry grove,</L>
<L>And winds shall waft it to the pow'rs above.</L>
<L>But would you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain,</L>
<L>The wond'ring forests soon should dance again,</L>
<L>The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call.</L>
<L>And headlong streams hang list'ning in their fall!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see the shepherds shun the noon-day heat,</L>
<L>The lowing herds to murm'ring brooks retreat,</L>
<L>To closer shades the panting flocks remove;</L>
<L>Ye Gods! and is there no relief for love?</L>
<L>But soon the sun with milder rays descends</L>
<L>To the cool ocean, where his journey ends:</L>
<L>On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey,</L>
<L>By night he scorches, as he burns by day.</L>

<L>This mourn'd a faithless, that an absent love,</L>
<L>And Delia's name and Doris' fill'd the grove.</L>

<L>Now setting Phoebus shone serenely bright,</L>
<L>And fleecy clouds were streak'd with purple light;</L>

<L>Go, gentle Gales, and bear my sighs away!</L>
<L>To Delia's ear the tender notes convey.</L>

<L>Go, gentle Gales, and bear my sighs along!</L>
<L>For her, the feather'd quires neglect their song;</L>

Ye Flow'rs that droop, forsaken by the spring,</L>

<L>Above the clouds, above the starry sky!</L>
<L>Eternal beauties grace the shining scene,</L>
<L>Fields ever fresh, and groves for ever green!</L>
<L>There while you rest in amaranthine bow'rs,</L>
<L>Or from those meads select unfading flow'rs,</L>
<L>Behold us kindly, who your name implore,</L>
<L>Daphne, our goddess, and our grief no more!</L>

<L>How all things listen while thy Muse complains!</L>
<L>Such silence waits on Philomela's strains,</L>
<L>In some still ev'ning, when the whisp'ring breeze</L>
<L>Pants on the leaves, and dies upon the trees.</L>
<L>To thee, bright Goddess, oft' a lamb shall bleed,</L>
<L>If teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed.</L>
<L>While plants their shade, or flow'rs their odours give,</L>
<L>Thy name, thy honour, and thy praise shall live!</L>

<L>But see, Orion sheds unwholsome dews;</L>
<L>Arise, the pines a noxious shade diffuse;</L>
<L>Sharp Boreas blows, and Nature feels decay,</L>
<L>Time conquers all, and we must Time obey.</L>
<L>Adieu, ye Vales, ye Mountains, Streams and Groves;</L>
<L>Adieu, ye Shepherds' rural Lays and Loves;</L>
<L>Adieu, my Flocks; farewell, ye Sylvan Crew;</L>
<L>Daphne, farewell; and all the World adieu!</L>
