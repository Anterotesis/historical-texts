<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>POLITICAL oeconomy, con&s;idered as a branch of the &s;cience of a &s;tate&s;man or legi&s;lator, propo&s;es two di&s;tinct objects; fir&s;t, to provide a plentiful revenue or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the people, or more properly to enable them to provide &s;uch a revenue or &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves; and &s;econdly, to &s;upply the &s;tate or com|monwealth with a revenue &s;ufficient for the publick &s;ervices. It propo&s;es to enrich both the people and the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE different progre&s;s of opulence in different ages and nations, has given occa&s;ion to two different &s;y&s;tems of political oeconomy, with regard to enriching the people. The one may be called the &s;y&s;tem of commerce, the other that of agriculture. I &s;hall endeavour to explain both as fully and di&s;tinctly as I can, and &s;hall begin with the &s;y&s;tem of commerce. It is the modern &s;y&s;tem, and is be&s;t under&s;tood in our own country and in our own times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Principle of the commercial, or mercantile Sy&s;tem.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT wealth con&s;i&s;ts in money, or in gold and &s;ilver, is a popular notion which naturally ari&s;es from the double function of money, as the in&s;trument of commerce, and as the mea&s;ure of value. In con&s;equence of its being the in&s;trument of commerce, when we have money we can more readily obtain whatever el&s;e we have occa&s;ion for, than by means of any other commodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is obtained, there is no difficulty in making any &s;ub|&s;equent purcha&s;e. In con&s;equence of its being the mea&s;ure of value, we e&s;timate that of all other commodities by the quantity of money which they will exchange for. We &s;ay of a rich man that he is worth a great deal, and of a poor man that he is worth very little money. A frugal man, or a man eager to be rich, is &s;aid to love money; and a carele&s;s, a generous, or a profu&s;e man, is &s;aid to be indifferent about it. To grow rich is to get money; and wealth and money, in &s;hort, are in common language con|&s;idered as in every re&s;pect &s;ynonymous.</P>
<P>A RICH country, in the &s;ame manner as a rich man, is &s;up|po&s;ed to be a country abounding in money; and to heap up gold and &s;ilver in any country is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the readie&s;t way to enrich it. For &s;ome time after the di&s;covery of America, the fir&s;t en|quiry of the Spaniards, when they arrived upon any unknown coa&s;t, u&s;ed to be, if there was any gold or &s;ilver to be found in the neighbourhood. By the information which they received, they judged whether it was worth while to make a &s;ettlement there, or if the country was worth the conquering. Plano Carpino, a monk
<PB N="3" REF="6">
&s;ent amba&s;&s;ador from the king of France to one of the &s;ons of the famous Gengis Khan, &s;ays that the Tartars u&s;ed frequently to a&s;k him if there was plenty of &s;heep and oxen in the kingdom of France. Their enquiry had the &s;ame object with that of the Spaniards. They wanted to know if the country was rich enough to be worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as among all other nations of &s;hepherds, who are generally ignorant of the u&s;e of money, cattle are the in&s;truments of commerce and the mea&s;ures of value. Wealth, therefore, according to them, con|&s;i&s;ted in cattle, as according to the Spaniards it con&s;i&s;ted in gold and &s;ilver. Of the two, the Tartar notion, perhaps, was the neare&s;t to the truth.</P>
<P>MR. Locke remarks a di&s;tinction between money and other moveable goods. All other moveable goods, he &s;ays, are of &s;o con&s;umable a nature that the wealth which con&s;i&s;ts in them cannot be much depended on, and a nation which abounds in them one year may, without any exportation, but merely by their own wa&s;te and extravagance, be in great want of them the next. Money, on the contrary, is a &s;teady friend, which, though it may travel about from hand to hand, yet, if it can be kept from going out of the country, is not very liable to be wa&s;ted and con|&s;umed. Gold and &s;ilver, therefore, are, according to him, the mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial part of the moveable wealth of a nation, and to multiply tho&s;e metals ought, he thinks, upon that account, to be the great object of its political oeconomy.</P>
<P>OTHERS admit that if a nation could be &s;eparated from all the world, it would be of no con&s;equence how much, or how little money circulated in it. The con&s;umable goods which were cir|culated by means of this money, would only be exchanged for a greater or a &s;maller number of pieces; but the real wealth or
<PB N="4" REF="7">
poverty of the country, they allow, would depend altogether upon the abundance or &s;carcity of tho&s;e con&s;umable goods. But it is otherwi&s;e, they think, with countries which have connections with foreign nations, and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain fleets and armies in di&s;tant countries. This, they &s;ay, cannot be done, but by &s;ending abroad money to pay them with; and a nation cannot &s;end much money abroad, unle&s;s it has a good deal at home. Every &s;uch nation, therefore, mu&s;t endeavour in time of peace to accumulate gold and &s;ilver, that, when occa&s;ion requires, it may have wherewithal to carry on foreign wars.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e popular notions, all the different nations of Europe have &s;tudied, though to little purpo&s;e, every po&s;&s;ible means of accumulating gold and &s;ilver in their re&s;pective countries. Spain and Portugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which &s;upply Europe with tho&s;e metals, have either prohibited their expor|tation under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, or &s;ubjected it to a con&s;iderable duty. The like prohibition &s;eems antiently to have made a part of the policy of mo&s;t other European nations. It is even to be found, where we &s;hould expect lea&s;t of all to find it, in &s;ome old Scotch acts of parliament, which forbid under heavy penalties the car|rying gold or &s;ilver <HI>forth of the kingdom.</HI> The like policy antiently took place both in France and England.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e countries became commercial, the merchants found this prohibition, upon many occa&s;ions, extreamly inconvenient. They could frequently buy more advantageou&s;ly with gold and &s;ilver than with any other commodity, the foreign goods which they wanted either to import into their own, or to carry to &s;ome other foreign country. They remon&s;trated, therefore, again&s;t this prohibition as hurtful to trade.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">
THEY repre&s;ented, fir&s;t, that the exportation of gold and &s;ilver in order to purcha&s;e foreign goods, did not always dimini&s;h the quantity of tho&s;e metals in the kingdom. That, on the contrary, it might frequently increa&s;e it; becau&s;e if the con&s;umption of foreign goods was not thereby increa&s;ed in the country, tho&s;e goods might be re-exported to foreign countries, and being there &s;old for a large profit, might bring back much more trea&s;ure than was originally &s;ent out to purcha&s;e them. Mr. Mun com|pares this operation of foreign trade to the &s;eed time and harve&s;t of agriculture. <Q>"If we only behold," &s;ays he,  "the actions of the hu&s;bandman in the &s;eed time when he ca&s;teth away much good corn into the ground, we &s;hall account him rather a madman than a hu&s;bandman. But when we con&s;ider his labours in the harve&s;t, which is the end of his endeavours, we &s;hall find the worth and plentiful increa&s;e of his actions."</Q></P>
<P>THEY repre&s;ented, &s;econdly, that this prohibition could not hinder the exportation of gold and &s;ilver, which, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of their bulk in proportion to their value, could ea&s;ily be &s;muggled abroad. That this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to, what they called, the balance of trade. That when the country exported to a greater value than it imported, a balance became due to it from foreign nations, which was nece&s;|&s;arily paid to it in gold and &s;ilver, and thereby increa&s;ed the quan|tity of tho&s;e metals in the kingdom. But that when it imported to a greater value than it exported, a contrary balance became due to foreign nations, which was nece&s;&s;arily paid to them in the &s;ame manner, and thereby dimini&s;hed that quantity. That in this ca&s;e to prohibit the exportation of tho&s;e metals could not prevent it, but only, by making it more dangerous, render it more expen&s;ive. That the exchange was thereby turned more again&s;t the country which owed the balance, than it otherwi&s;e might have been; the merchant who purcha&s;ed a bill upon the foreign country being
<PB N="6" REF="9">
obliged to pay the banker who &s;old it, not only for the natural ri&s;k, trouble and expence of &s;ending the money thither, but for the extraordinary ri&s;k ari&s;ing from the prohibition. But that the more the exchange was again&s;t any country, the more the balance of trade became nece&s;&s;arily again&s;t it; the money of that country becoming nece&s;&s;arily of &s;o much le&s;s value, in compari&s;on with that of the country to which the balance was due. That if the exchange between England and Holland, for example, was five per cent. again&s;t England, it would require a hundred and five ounces of &s;ilver in England to purcha&s;e a bill for a hundred ounces of &s;ilver in Holland: that a hundred and five ounces of &s;ilver in England, therefore, would be worth only a hundred ounces of &s;ilver in Holland, and would purcha&s;e only a proportionable quan|tity of Dutch goods: but that a hundred ounces of &s;ilver in Hol|land, on the contrary, would be worth a hundred and five ounces in England, and would purcha&s;e a proportionable quantity of Engli&s;h goods: That the Engli&s;h goods which were &s;old to Holland would be &s;old &s;o much cheaper; and the Dutch goods which were &s;old to England, &s;o much dearer, by the difference of the ex|change; that the one would draw &s;o much le&s;s Dutch money to England, and the other &s;o much more Engli&s;h money to Holland, as this difference amounted to: and that the balance of trade, therefore, would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o much more again&s;t England, and would require a greater balance of gold and &s;ilver to be ex|ported to Holland.</P>
<P>THOSE arguments were partly &s;olid and partly &s;ophi&s;tical. They were &s;olid &s;o far as they a&s;&s;erted that the exportation of gold and &s;ilver in trade might frequently be advantageous to the country. They were &s;olid too in a&s;&s;erting that no prohibition could prevent their exportation, when private people found any advantage in ex|porting them. But they were &s;ophi&s;tical in &s;uppo&s;ing, that either
<PB N="7" REF="10">
to pre&s;erve or to augment the quantity of tho&s;e metals required more the attention of government, than to pre&s;erve or to augment the quantity of any other u&s;eful commodities, which the freedom of trade, without any &s;uch attention, never fails to &s;upply in the proper quantity. They were &s;ophi&s;tical too, perhaps, in a&s;&s;ert|ing that the high price of exchange nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed, what they called, the unfavourable balance of trade, or occa&s;ioned the ex|portation of a greater quantity of gold and &s;ilver. That high price, indeed, was extremely di&s;advantageous to the merchants who had any money to pay in foreign countries. They paid &s;o much dearer for the bills which their bankers granted them upon tho&s;e countries. But though the ri&s;k ari&s;ing from the prohibition might occa&s;ion &s;ome extraordinary expence to the bankers, it would not nece&s;&s;arily carry any more money out of the country. This expence would generally be all laid out in the country, in &s;mug|gling the money out of it, and could &s;eldom occa&s;ion the export|ation of a &s;ingle &s;ix-pence beyond the preci&s;e &s;um drawn for. The high price of exchange too would naturally di&s;po&s;e the mer|chants to endeavour to make their exports nearly balance their im|ports, in order that they might have this high exchange to pay upon as &s;mall a &s;um as po&s;&s;ible. The high price of exchange, therefore, would tend, not to increa&s;e, but to dimini&s;h, what they called, the unfavourable balance of trade, and con&s;equently the exportation of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>SUCH as they were, however, tho&s;e arguments convinced the people to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed. They were addre&s;&s;ed by merchants to parliaments, and to the councils of princes, to nobles and to country gentlemen; by tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand trade, to tho&s;e who were con&s;cious to them&s;elves that they knew nothing about the matter. That foreign trade enriched the country, experience demon&s;trated to the nobles and country
<PB N="8" REF="11">
gentlemen, as well as to the merchants; but how, or in what manner, none of them well knew. The merchants knew perfectly in what manner it enriched them&s;elves. It was their bu&s;ine&s;s to know it. But to know in what manner it enriched the country, was no part of their bu&s;ine&s;s. This &s;ubject never came into their con&s;ideration, but when they had occa&s;ion to apply to their country for &s;ome change in the laws relating to foreign trade. It then became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething about the beneficial effects of foreign trade, and the manner in which tho&s;e effects were ob&s;tructed by the laws as they then &s;tood. To the judges who were to decide the bu&s;ine&s;s, it appeared a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory account of the matter, when they were told that foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the laws in que&s;tion hindered it from bringing &s;o much as it otherwi&s;e would do. Tho&s;e arguments therefore produced the wi&s;hed-for effect. The prohibition of exporting gold and &s;ilver was in France and England confined to the coin of tho&s;e re&s;pective countries. The exportation of foreign coin and of bullion was made free. In Holland, and in &s;ome other places, this liberty was extended even to the coin of the country. The attention of government was turned away from guarding again&s;t the exportation of gold and &s;ilver, to watch over the balance of trade, as the only cau&s;e which could occa&s;ion any augmentation or diminution of tho&s;e metals. From one fruitle&s;s care it was turned away to an|other care much more intricate, much more embarra&s;&s;ing, and ju&s;t equally fruitle&s;s. The title of Mun's book, England's Trea&s;ure in Foreign Trade, became a fundamental maxim in the political oeconomy, not of England only, but of all other commercial countries. The inland or home trade, the mo&s;t important of all, the trade in which an equal capital affords the greate&s;t revenue and creates the greate&s;t employment to the people of the country, was con&s;idered as &s;ub&s;idiary only to foreign trade. It neither brought money into the country, it was &s;aid, nor carried any out of it.
<PB N="9" REF="12">
The country therefore could never become either richer or poorer by means of it, except &s;o far as its pro&s;perity or decay might indirectly influence the &s;tate of foreign trade.</P>
<P>A COUNTRY that has no mines of its own mu&s;t undoubtedly draw its gold and &s;ilver from foreign countries, in the &s;ame manner as one that has no vineyards of its own mu&s;t draw its wines. It does not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the attention of government &s;hould be more turned towards the one than towards the other object. A country that has wherewithal to buy wine, will always get the wine which it has occa&s;ion for; and a country that has wherewithal to buy gold and &s;ilver, will never be in want of tho&s;e metals. They are to be bought for a certain price like all other commodities, and as they are the price of all other commodities, &s;o all other com|modities are the price of tho&s;e metals. We tru&s;t with perfect &s;ecu|rity that the freedom of trade, without any attention of govern|ment, will always &s;upply us with the wine which we have occa&s;ion for: and we may tru&s;t with equal &s;ecurity that it will always &s;up|ply us with all the gold and &s;ilver which we can afford to purcha&s;e or to employ, either in circulating our commodities or in other u&s;es.</P>
<P>THE quantity of every commodity which human indu&s;try can either purcha&s;e or produce, naturally regulates it&s;elf in every country according to the effectual demand, or according to the demand of tho&s;e who are willing to pay the whole rent, labour, and profits which mu&s;t be paid in order to prepare and bring it to market. But no commodities regulate them&s;elves more ea&s;ily or more exactly accord|ing to this effectual demand than gold and &s;ilver; becau&s;e on account of the &s;mall bulk and great value of tho&s;e metals, no commodities can be more ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from one place to another, from the places where they are cheap, to tho&s;e where they are dear, from the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
places where they exceed, to tho&s;e where they fall &s;hort of this ef|fectual demand. If there was in England, for example, an effectual demand for an additional quantity of gold, a packet-boat could bring from Li&s;bon, or from wherever el&s;e it was to be had, fifty tuns of gold, which could be coined into more than five mil|lions of guineas. But if there was an effectual demand for grain to the &s;ame value, to import it would require, at five guineas a tun, a million of tuns of &s;hipping, or a thou&s;and &s;hips of a thou&s;and tuns each. The navy of England would not be &s;uf|ficient.</P>
<P>WHEN the quantity of gold and &s;ilver imported into any country exceeds the effectual demand, no vigilance of government can prevent their exportation. All the &s;anguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to keep their gold and &s;ilver at home. The continual importations from Peru and Brazil exceed the effectual demand of tho&s;e countries, and &s;ink the price of tho&s;e metals there below that in the neighbouring countries. If, on the contrary, in any particular country their quantity fell &s;hort of the effectual demand, &s;o as to rai&s;e their price above that in the neighbouring countries, the government would have no occa&s;ion to take any pains to import them. If it was even to take pains to prevent their importation, it would not be able to effectuate it. Tho&s;e metals, when the Spartans had got wherewithal to purcha&s;e them, broke through all the barriers which the laws of Lycurgus oppo&s;ed to their entrance into Lacedemon. All the &s;anguinary laws of the cu&s;toms, are not able to prevent the importation of the teas of the Dutch and Gottenburg Ea&s;t India companies; becau&s;e &s;omewhat cheaper than tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h company. A pound of tea, however, is about a hundred times the bulk of one of the highe&s;t prices, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, that is commonly paid for it in &s;ilver, and more than two thou&s;and times the bulk of the
<PB N="11" REF="14">
&s;ame price in gold, and con&s;equently ju&s;t &s;o many times more dif|ficult to &s;muggle.</P>
<P>IT is partly owing to the ea&s;y tran&s;portation of gold and &s;ilver from the places where they abound to tho&s;e where they are wanted, that the price of tho&s;e metals does not fluctuate continually like that of the greater part of other commodities, which are hindered by their bulk from &s;hifting their &s;ituation, when the market happens to be either over or under&s;tocked with them. The price of tho&s;e metals, indeed, is not altogether exempted from variation, but the changes to which it is liable are generally &s;low, gradual, and uni|form. In Europe, for example, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, without much foundation perhaps, that, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent and preceeding century, they have been con&s;tantly but gradually &s;ink|ing in their value, on account of the continual importations from the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies. But to make any &s;udden change in the price of gold and &s;ilver, &s;o as to rai&s;e or lower at once, &s;en&s;ibly and remarkably, the money price of all other commodities, re|quires &s;uch a revolution in commerce as that occa&s;ioned by the di&s;covery of America.</P>
<P>IF notwith&s;tanding all this, gold and &s;ilver &s;hould at any time fall &s;hort in a country which has wherewithal to purcha&s;e them, there are more expedients for &s;upplying their place, than that of almo&s;t any other commodity. If the materials of manufacture are wanted, indu&s;try mu&s;t &s;top. If provi&s;ions are wanted, the people mu&s;t &s;tarve. But if money is wanted, barter will &s;upply its place, though with a good deal of inconveniency. Buying and &s;elling upon credit, and the different dealers compen&s;ating their credits with one another, once a month or once a year, will &s;upply it with le&s;s inconveniency. A well regulated paper money will &s;upply it, not only without any inconveniency, but with very
<PB N="12" REF="15">
great advantages. Upon every account, therefore, the attention of government never was &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily employed, as when di|rected to watch over the pre&s;ervation or increa&s;e of the quantity of money in any country.</P>
<P>No complaint, however, is more common than that of a &s;carcity of money. Money, like wine, mu&s;t always be &s;carce with tho&s;e who have neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it. Tho&s;e who have either, will &s;eldom be in want either of the money, or of the wine which they have occa&s;ion for. This complaint; however, of the &s;carcity of money, is not always confined to im|provident &s;pendthrifts. It is &s;ometimes general through a whole mercantile town, and the country in its neighbourhood. Over|trading is the common cau&s;e of it. Sober men, who&s;e projects have been di&s;proportioned to their capitals, are as likely to have neither wherewithal to buy money, nor credit to borrow it, as pro|digals who&s;e expence has been di&s;proportioned to their revenue. Before their projects can be brought to bear, their &s;tock is gone, and their credit with it. They run about everywhere to borrow money, and every body tells them that they have none to lend. Even &s;uch general complaints of the &s;carcity of money do not always prove that the u&s;ual number of gold and &s;ilver pieces are not circulating in the country, but that many people want tho&s;e pieces who have nothing to give for them. When the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary, overtrading becomes a general error both among great and &s;mall dealers. They do not always &s;end more money abroad than u&s;ual, but they buy upon credit both at home and abroad, an unu&s;ual quantity of goods, which they &s;end to &s;ome di&s;tant market, in hopes that the returns will come in before the demand for payment. The demand comes before the returns, and they have nothing at hand, with which they can either pur|cha&s;e money, or give &s;olid &s;ecurity for borrowing. It is not any
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver, but the difficulty which &s;uch people find in borrowing, and which their creditors find in getting payment, that occa&s;ions the general complaint of the &s;carcity of money.</P>
<P>IT would be too ridiculous to go about &s;eriou&s;ly to prove, that wealth does not con&s;i&s;t in money, or in gold and &s;ilver; but in what money purcha&s;es, and is valuable only for purcha&s;ing. Money, no doubt, makes always a part of the national capital; but it has already been &s;hown that it generally makes but a &s;mall part, and always the mo&s;t unprofitable part of it.</P>
<P>IT is not becau&s;e wealth con&s;i&s;ts more e&s;&s;entially in money than in goods, that the merchant finds it generally more ea&s;y to buy goods with money, than to buy money with goods; but becau&s;e money is the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;trument of commerce, for which every thing is readily given in exchange, but which is not always with equal readine&s;s to be got in exchange for every thing. The greater part of goods be&s;ides are more peri&s;hable than money, and he may frequently &s;u&s;tain a much greater lo&s;s by keeping them. When his goods are upon hand too, he is more liable to &s;uch demands for money as he may not be able to an&s;wer, than when he has got their price in his coffers. Over and above all this, his profit ari&s;es more directly from &s;elling than from buying, and he is upon all the&s;e accounts generally much more anxious to exchange his goods for money, than his money for goods. But though a particular merchant, with abundance of goods in his warehou&s;e, may &s;ometimes be ruined by not being able to &s;ell them in time, a nation or country is not liable to the &s;ame accident. The whole capital of a merchant frequently con&s;i&s;ts in peri&s;hable goods de&s;tined for purcha&s;ing money. But it is but a very &s;mall part of the annual produce of the land and labour of a country which can ever be de&s;tined for purcha&s;ing gold and &s;ilver
<PB N="14" REF="17">
from their neighbours. The far greater part is circulated and con&s;umed among them&s;elves; and even of the &s;urplus which is &s;ent abroad, the greater part is generally de&s;tined for the purcha&s;e of other foreign goods. Though gold and &s;ilver, therefore, could not be had in exchange for the goods de&s;tined to purcha&s;e them, the nation would not be ruined. It might, indeed, &s;uffer &s;ome lo&s;s and inconveniency, and be forced upon &s;ome of tho&s;e expe|dients which are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying the place of money. The annual produce of its land and labour, however, would be the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame, as u&s;ual, becau&s;e the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame con&s;umable capital would be employed in maintaining it. And though goods do not always draw money &s;o readily as money draws goods, in the long-run they draw it more nece&s;&s;arily than even it draws them. Goods can &s;erve many other purpo&s;es be&s;ides purcha&s;ing money, but money can &s;erve no other purpo&s;e be&s;ides purcha&s;ing goods. Money, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily runs after goods, but goods do not always or nece&s;&s;arily run after money. The man who buys, does not always mean to &s;ell again, but frequently to u&s;e or to con&s;ume; whereas he who &s;ells, always means to buy again. The one may frequently have done the whole, but the other can never have done more than the one-half of his bu&s;ine&s;s. It is not for its own &s;ake that men de&s;ire money, but for the &s;ake of what they can purcha&s;e with it.</P>
<P>CONSUMABLE commodities, it is &s;aid, are &s;oon de&s;troyed; where|as gold and &s;ilver are of a more durable nature, and, were it not for this continual exportation, might be accumulated for ages to|gether, to the incredible augmentation of the real wealth of the country. Nothing, therefore, it is pretended, can be more di&s;|advantageous to any country, than the trade which con&s;i&s;ts in the exchange of &s;uch la&s;ting for &s;uch peri&s;hable commodities. We do not, however, reckon that trade di&s;advantageous which con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="15" REF="18">
in the exchange of the hardware of England for the wines of France; and yet hardware is a very durable commodity, and was it not for this continual exportation, might too be accumulated for ages together, to the incredible augmentation of the pots and pans of the country. But it readily occurs that the number of &s;uch uten&s;ils is in every country nece&s;&s;arily limited by the u&s;e which there is for them; that it would be ab&s;urd to have more pots and pans than were nece&s;&s;ary for cooking the victuals u&s;ually con&s;umed there; and that if the quantity of victuals were to in|crea&s;e, the number of pots and pans would readily increa&s;e along with it, a part of the increa&s;ed quantity of victuals being employed in purcha&s;ing them, or in maintaining an additional number of workmen who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to make them. It &s;hould as readily occur that the quantity of gold and &s;ilver is in every country limited by the u&s;e which there is for tho&s;e metals; that their u&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in circulating commodities as coin, and in affording a &s;pecies of hou&s;hold furniture as plate; that the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it: increa&s;e that value, and immediately a part of it will be &s;ent abroad to purcha&s;e, wherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of coin requi&s;ite for circulating them: that the quantity of plate is regulated by the number and wealth of tho&s;e private families who chu&s;e to indulge them&s;elves in that &s;ort of magnificence: increa&s;e the number and wealth of &s;uch families, and a part of this increa&s;ed wealth will mo&s;t probably be employed in purcha&s;ing, wherever it is to be found, an addi|tional quantity of plate: that to attempt to increa&s;e the wealth of any country, either by introducing or by detaining in it an unnece&s;&s;ary quantity of gold and &s;ilver, is as ab&s;urd as it would be to attempt to increa&s;e the good cheer of private families, by obliging them to keep an unnece&s;&s;ary number of kitchen uten&s;ils. As the expence of purcha&s;ing tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils would dimini&s;h
<PB N="16" REF="19">
in&s;tead of increa&s;ing either the quantity or goodne&s;s of the family provi&s;ions; &s;o the expence of purcha&s;ing an unnece&s;&s;ary quantity of gold and &s;ilver mu&s;t, in every country, as nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h the wealth which feeds, cloaths and lodges, which maintains and employs the people. Gold and &s;ilver, whether in the &s;hape of coin or of plate, are uten&s;ils, it mu&s;t be remembered, as much as the furniture of the kitchen. Increa&s;e the u&s;e for them, increa&s;e the con&s;umable commodities which are to be circulated, managed and prepared by means of them, and you will infallibly increa&s;e the quantity; but if you attempt, by extraordinary means, to in|crea&s;e the quantity, you will as infallibly dimini&s;h the u&s;e and even the quantity too, which in tho&s;e metals can never be greater than what the u&s;e requires. Were they ever to be accumulated beyond this quantity, their tran&s;portation is &s;o ea&s;y, and the lo&s;s which attends their lying idle and unemployed &s;o great, that no law could prevent their being immediately &s;ent out of the country.</P>
<P>IT is not always nece&s;&s;ary to accumulate gold and &s;ilver, in order to enable a country to carry on foreign wars, and to main|tain fleets and armies in di&s;tant countries. Fleets and armies are maintained, not with gold and &s;ilver, but with con&s;umable goods. The nation which, from the annual produce of its dome&s;tic indu&s;try, from the annual revenue ari&s;ing out of its lands, labour and con|&s;umable &s;tock, has wherewithal to purcha&s;e tho&s;e con&s;umable goods in di&s;tant countries, can maintain foreign wars there.</P>
<P>A NATION may purcha&s;e the pay and provi&s;ions of an army in a di&s;tant country three different ways; by &s;ending abroad either, fir&s;t, &s;ome part of its accumulated gold and &s;ilver; or, &s;econdly, &s;ome part of the annual produce of its manufactures; or la&s;t of all, &s;ome part of its annual rude produce.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">
THE gold and &s;ilver which can properly be con&s;idered as accumu|lated or &s;tored up in any country, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three parts; fir&s;t, the circulating money; &s;econdly, the plate of private families; and la&s;t of all, the money which may have been collected by many years par&s;imony, and laid up in the trea&s;ury of the prince.</P>
<P>IT can &s;eldom happen that much can be &s;pared from the circulating money of the country; becau&s;e in that there can &s;eldom be much redundancy. The value of goods annually bought and &s;old in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and di&s;tribute them to their proper con&s;umers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation nece&s;&s;a|rily draws to it&s;elf a &s;um &s;ufficient to fill it, and never admits any more. Something, however, is generally withdrawn from this channel in the ca&s;e of foreign war. By the great number of people who are maintained abroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are circulated there, and le&s;s money becomes nece&s;&s;ary to circulate them. An extraordinary quantity of paper money, of &s;ome &s;ort or other too, &s;uch as exchequer notes, navy bills, and bank bills in England, is generally i&s;&s;ued upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and by &s;upplying the place of circulating gold and &s;ilver, gives an opportunity of &s;ending a greater quantity of it abroad. All this, however, could afford but a poor re&s;ource for maintaining a foreign war, of great expence and &s;everal years duration.</P>
<P>THE melting down the plate of private families, has upon every occa&s;ion been found a &s;till more in&s;ignificant one. The French, in the beginning of the la&s;t war, did not derive &s;o much advantage from this expedient as to compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>THE accumulated trea&s;ures of the prince have, in former times, afforded a much greater and more la&s;ting re&s;ource. In the pre&s;ent times, if you except the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, to accumulate trea&s;ure &s;eems to be no part of the policy of European princes.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21">
THE funds which maintained the foreign wars of the pre&s;ent century, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive perhaps which hi&s;tory records, &s;eem to have had little dependency upon the exportation either of the circulating money, or of the plate of private families, or of the trea&s;ure of the prince. The la&s;t French war co&s;t Great Britain upwards of ninety millions, including not only the &s;eventy-five millions of new debt that was contracted, but the additional two &s;hillings in the pound land tax, and what was annually borrowed of the &s;inking fund. More than two-thirds of this expence was laid out in di&s;tant countries; in Germany, Portugal, America, in the ports of the Mediterranean, in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. The kings of England had no accumulated trea&s;ure. We never heard of any extraordinary quantity of plate being melted down. The circulating gold and &s;ilver of the country had not been &s;up|po&s;ed to exceed eighteen millions. Since the late recoinage of the gold, however, it is believed to have been a good deal under-rated. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, according to the exaggerated computation of Mr. Hor&s;ely, that, gold and &s;ilver together, it amounted to thirty millions. Had the war been carried on, by means of our money, the whole of it mu&s;t, even according to this computation, have been &s;ent out and returned again at lea&s;t twice, in a period of between &s;ix and &s;even years. Should this be &s;uppo&s;ed, it would afford the mo&s;t deci&s;ive argument to demon&s;trate how unnece&s;&s;ary it is for government to watch over the pre&s;ervation of money, &s;ince upon this &s;uppo&s;ition the whole money of the country mu&s;t have gone from it and returned to it again, two different times in &s;o &s;hort a period, without any body's knowing any thing of the matter. The channel of circulation, however, never appeared more empty than u&s;ual during any part of this period. Few peo|ple wanted money who had wherewithal to pay for it. The profits of foreign trade, indeed, were greater than u&s;ual during the whole war; but e&s;pecially towards the end of it. This occa&s;ioned, what it always occa&s;ions, a general overtrading in all the ports of Great Britain; and this again occa&s;ioned the u&s;ual complaint of the
<PB N="19" REF="22">
&s;carcity of money, which always follows overtrading. Many people wanted it, who had neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it; and becau&s;e the debtors found it difficult to borrow, the creditors found it difficult to get payment. Gold and &s;ilver, however, were generally to be had for their value, by tho&s;e who had that value to give for them.</P>
<P>THE enormous expence of the late war, therefore, mu&s;t have been chiefly defrayed, not by the exportation of gold and &s;ilver, but by that of Briti&s;h commodities of &s;ome kind or other. When the government, or tho&s;e who acted under them, contracted with a merchant for a remittance to &s;ome foreign country, he would naturally endeavour to pay his foreign corre&s;pondent, upon whom he had granted a bill, by &s;ending abroad rather commodities than gold and &s;ilver. If the commodities of Great Britain were not in demand in that country, he would endeavour to &s;end them to &s;ome other country, in which he could purcha&s;e a bill upon that country. The tran&s;portation of commodities, when properly fuited to the market, is always attended with a con&s;iderable profit; whereas that of gold and &s;ilver is &s;carce ever attended with any. When tho&s;e metals are &s;ent abroad in order to purcha&s;e foreign commodities, the merchant's profit ari&s;es, not from the purcha&s;e, but from the &s;ale of the returns. But when they are &s;ent abroad merely to pay a debt, he gets no returns, and con&s;equently no profit. He naturally, therefore, exerts his invention to find out a way of paying his foreign debts, rather by the exportation of commodities than by that of gold and &s;ilver. The great quantity of Briti&s;h goods ex|ported during the cour&s;e of the late war, without bringing back any returns, is accordingly remarked by the author of The Pre&s;ent State of the Nation.</P>
<P>BESIDES the three &s;orts of gold and &s;ilver above mentioned, there is in all great commercial countries a good deal of bullion alter|nately
<PB N="20" REF="23">
imported and exported for the purpo&s;es of foreign trade. This bullion, as it circulates among different commercial countries in the &s;ame manner as the national coin circulates in every particular country, may be con&s;idered as the money of the great mercantile republick. The national coin receives its movement and di|rection from the commodities circulated within the precincts of each particular country: the money of the mercantile republick, from tho&s;e circulated between different countries. Both are em|ployed in facilitating exchanges, the one between different indivi|duals of the &s;ame, the other between tho&s;e of different nations. Part of this money of the great mercantile republick may have been, and probably was, employed in carrying on the late war. In time of a general war, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that a movement and direction &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed upon it, different from what it u&s;ually follows in profound peace; that it &s;hould circulate more about the &s;eat of the war, and be more employed in purcha&s;ing there, and in the neighbouring countries, the pay and provi&s;ions of the different armies. But whatever part of this money of the mercantile republick, Great Britain may have annually em|ployed in this manner, it mu&s;t have been annually purcha&s;ed, either with Briti&s;h commodities, or with &s;omething el&s;e that had been pur|cha&s;ed with them; which &s;till brings us back to commodities, to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as the ultimate re&s;ources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is natural indeed to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;o great an annual expence mu&s;t have been de|frayed from a great annual produce. The expence of 1761, for example, amounted to more than nineteen millions. No accumulation could have &s;upported &s;o great an annual profu&s;ion. There is no annual produce even of gold and &s;ilver which could have &s;upported it. The whole gold and &s;ilver annually im|ported into both Spain and Portugal, according to the be&s;t accounts, does not commonly much exceed &s;ix millions &s;terling,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
which, in &s;ome years, would &s;carce have paid four months expence of the late war.</P>
<P>THE commodities mo&s;t proper for being tran&s;ported to di&s;tant countries, in order to purcha&s;e there, either the pay and provi&s;ions of an army, or &s;ome part of the money of the mercantile republick to be employed in purcha&s;ing them, &s;eem to be the finer and more improved manufactures; &s;uch as contain a great value in a &s;mall bulk, and can, therefore, be exported to a great di&s;tance at little expence. A country who&s;e indu&s;try produces a great annual &s;urplus of &s;uch manufactures, which are u&s;ually exported to foreign countries, may carry on for many years a very expen&s;ive foreign war, without either exporting any con&s;iderable quantity of gold and &s;ilver, or even having any &s;uch quantity to export. A con|&s;iderable part of the annual &s;urplus of its manufactures mu&s;t, indeed, in this ca&s;e be exported, without bringing back any returns. Some part of it, however, may &s;till continue to bring back a return. The manufacturers, during the war, will have a double demand upon them, and be called upon, fir&s;t, to work up goods to be &s;ent abroad, for paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provi&s;ions of the army; and, &s;econdly, to work up &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary for purcha&s;ing the common returns that had u&s;ually been con&s;umed in the country. In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive foreign war, therefore, the greater part of manufactures may frequently flouri&s;h greatly; and, on the contrary, they may decline on the return of the peace. They may flouri&s;h amid&s;t the ruin of their country, and begin to decay upon the return of its pro&s;perity. The different &s;tate of many different branches of the Briti&s;h manufactures during the late war, and for &s;ome time after the peace, may &s;erve as an illu&s;tration of what has been ju&s;t now &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">
No foreign war of great expence or duration could conveniently be carried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the &s;oil. The expence of &s;ending &s;uch a quantity of it to a foreign country as might purcha&s;e the pay and provi&s;ions of an army, would be too great. Few countries too produce much more rude produce than what is &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their own inhabitants. To &s;end abroad any great quantity of it therefore, would be to &s;end abroad a part of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people. It is otherwi&s;e with the exportation of manufactures. The maintenance of the people employed in them is kept at home, and only the &s;ur|plus part of their work is exported. Mr. Hume frequently takes notice of the inability of the antient kings of England to carry on, without interruption, any foreign war of long duration. The Engli&s;h, in tho&s;e days, had nothing wherewithal to purcha&s;e the pay and provi&s;ions of their armies in foreign countries, but either the rude produce of the &s;oil, of which no con&s;iderable part could be &s;pared from the home con&s;umption, or a few manufactures of the coar&s;e&s;t kind, of which, as well as of the rude produce, the tran&s;|portation was too expen&s;ive. This inability did not ari&s;e from the want of money, but of the finer and more improved manufactures. Buying and &s;elling was tran&s;acted by means of money in England then, as well as now. The quantity of circulating money mu&s;t have borne the &s;ame proportion to the number and value of pur|cha&s;es and &s;ales u&s;ually tran&s;acted at that time, which it does to tho&s;e tran&s;acted at pre&s;ent; or rather it mu&s;t have borne a greater proportion, becau&s;e there was then no paper, which now occupies a great part of the employment of gold and &s;ilver. Among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known, the &s;overeign, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, can &s;eldom draw any con&s;iderable aid from his &s;ubjects, for rea&s;ons which &s;hall be explained hereafter. It is in &s;uch countries, therefore, that he generally endeavours to accumulate a trea&s;ure, as the only re&s;ource again&s;t &s;uch emergencies. Independant of this nece&s;&s;ity, he is in
<PB N="23" REF="26">
&s;uch a &s;ituation naturally di&s;po&s;ed to the par&s;imony requi&s;ite for accumulation. In that &s;imple &s;tate, the expence even of a &s;ove|reign is not directed by the vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court, but is employed in bounty to his tenants, and ho&s;|pitality to his retainers. But bounty and ho&s;pitality very &s;eldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almo&s;t always does. Every Tartar chief, accordingly, has a trea&s;ure. The trea&s;ures of Ma|zepa, chief of the Co&s;&s;acks in the Ukraine, the famous ally of Charles the XIIth, are &s;aid to have been very great. The French kings of the Merovingian race had all trea&s;ures. When they divided their kingdom among their different children, they divided their trea&s;ure too. The Saxon princes, and the fir&s;t kings after the conque&s;t, &s;eem likewi&s;e to have accumulated trea&s;ures. The fir&s;t exploit of every new reign was commonly to &s;eize the trea&s;ure of the preceeding king, as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential mea&s;ure for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The &s;overeigns of improved and com|mercial countries are not under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of accumulating trea&s;ures, becau&s;e they can generally draw from their &s;ubjects ex|traordinary aids upon extraordinary occa&s;ions. They are likewi&s;e le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o. They naturally, perhaps nece&s;&s;arily, follow the mode of the times, and their expence comes to be regulated by the &s;ame extravagant vanity which directs that of all the other great proprietors in their dominions. The in&s;ignificant pageantry of their court becomes every day more brilliant, and the expence of it not only prevents accumulation, but frequently encroaches upon the funds de&s;tined for more nece&s;&s;ary expences. What Dercyllidas &s;aid of the court of Per&s;ia, may be applied to that of &s;everal European princes, that he &s;aw there much &s;plendor but little &s;trength, and many &s;ervants but few &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>THE importation of gold and &s;ilver is not the principal, much le&s;s the &s;ole benefit which a nation derives from its foreign trade.
<PB N="24" REF="27">
Between whatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two di&s;tinct benefits from it. It carries out that &s;ur|plus part of the produce of their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and brings back in return for it &s;ome|thing el&s;e for which there is a demand. It gives a value to their &s;uperfluities, by exchanging them for &s;omething el&s;e, which may &s;atisfy a part of their wants, and increa&s;e their enjoyments. By means of it, the narrowne&s;s of the home market does not hinder the divi&s;ion of labour in any particular branch of art or manu|facture from being carried to the highe&s;t perfection. By opening a more exten&s;ive market for whatever part of the produce of their labour may exceed the home con&s;umption, it encourages them to improve its productive powers, and to augment its annual produce to the utmo&s;t, and thereby increa&s;e the real revenue and wealth of the &s;ociety. The&s;e great and important &s;ervices foreign trade is continually occupied in performing, to all the different countries between which it is carried on. They all derive great benefit from it, though that in which the merchant re&s;ides generally derives the greate&s;t, as he is generally more employed in &s;upplying the wants, and carrying out the &s;uperfluities of his own, than of any other par|ticular country. To import the gold and &s;ilver which may be wanted, into the countries which have no mines, is, no doubt, a part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of foreign commerce. It is, however, a mo&s;t in&s;ig|nificant part of it. A country which carried on foreign trade merely upon this account, could &s;carce have occa&s;ion to freight a &s;hip in a century.</P>
<P>IT is not by the importation of gold and &s;ilver, that the di&s;|covery of America has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, tho&s;e metals have become cheaper. A &s;ervice of plate can now be purcha&s;ed for about a third part of the corn, or a third part of the labour, which it would have co&s;t in the
<PB N="25" REF="28">
fifteenth century. With the &s;ame annual expence of labour and commodities, Europe can annually purcha&s;e about three times the quantity of plate which it could have purcha&s;ed at that time. But when a commodity comes to be &s;old for a third part of what had been its u&s;ual price, not only tho&s;e who purcha&s;ed it before can purcha&s;e three times their former quantity, but it is brought down to the level of a much greater number of purcha|&s;ers; perhaps to more than ten, perhaps to more than twenty times the former number. So that there may be in Europe at pre&s;ent, not only more than three times, but more than twenty or thirty times the quantity of plate which would have been in it, even in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement, had the di&s;covery of the American mines never been made. So far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency, though &s;urely a very trifling one. The cheapne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver renders tho&s;e metals rather le&s;s fit for the purpo&s;es of money than they were before. In order to make the &s;ame purcha&s;es, we mu&s;t load our&s;elves with a greater quantity of them, and carry about a &s;hilling in our pocket where a groat would have done before. It is difficult to &s;ay which is mo&s;t trifling, this inconveniency, or the oppo&s;ite conveniency. Neither the one nor the other could have made any very e&s;&s;ential change in the &s;tate of Europe. The di&s;covery of America, how|ever, certainly made a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential one. By opening a new and inexhau&s;tible market to all the commodities of Europe, it gave occa&s;ion to new divi&s;ions of labour and improvements of art, which, in the narrow circle of the antient commerce, could never have taken place for want of a market to take off the greater part of their produce. The productive powers of labour were im|proved, and its produce increa&s;ed in all the different countries of Europe, and together with it the real revenue and wealth of the inhabitants. The commodities of Europe were almo&s;t all new to America, and many of tho&s;e of America were new to Europe.
<PB N="26" REF="29">
A new &s;ett of exchanges, therefore, began to take place which had never been thought of before, and which &s;hould naturally have proved as advantageous to the new, as it certainly did to the old continent. The &s;avage inju&s;tice of the Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have been beneficial to all, ruinous and de&s;tructive to &s;everal of tho&s;e unfortunate countries.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope, which happened much about the &s;ame time, opened, perhaps, a &s;till more exten&s;ive range to foreign commerce than even that of America, notwith&s;tanding the greater di&s;tance. There were but two nations in America, in any re&s;pect &s;uperior to &s;avages, and the&s;e were de&s;troyed almo&s;t as &s;oon as di&s;covered. The re&s;t were mere &s;avages. But the empires of China, Indo&s;tan, Japan, as well as &s;everal others in the Ea&s;t Indies, without having richer mines of gold or &s;ilver, were in every other re&s;pect much richer, better cultivated, and more advanced in all arts and manufactures than either Mexico or Peru, even though we &s;hould credit, what plainly de&s;erves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spani&s;h writers, concerning the antient &s;tate of tho&s;e empires. But rich and civilized nations can always exchange to a much greater value with one another, than with &s;avages and barbarians. Europe, however, has hitherto derived much le&s;s advantage from its com|merce with the Ea&s;t Indies, than from that with America. The Portugue&s;e monopoli&s;ed the Ea&s;t India trade to them&s;elves for about a century, and it was only indirectly and through them, that the other nations of Europe could either &s;end out or receive any goods from that country. When the Dutch, in the beginning of the la&s;t century, began to encroach upon them, they ve&s;ted their whole Ea&s;t India commerce in an exclu&s;ive company. The Engli&s;h, French, Swedes, and Danes, have all followed their example, &s;o that no great nation in Europe has ever yet had the benefit of a
<PB N="27" REF="30">
free commerce to the Ea&s;t Indies. No other rea&s;on need be a&s;&s;igned why it has never been &s;o advantageous as the trade to America, which, between almo&s;t every nation of Europe and its own colonies, is free to all its &s;ubjects. The exclu&s;ive privileges of tho&s;e Ea&s;t India companies, their great riches, the great favour and protection which the&s;e have prooured them from their re&s;pective governments, have excited much envy again&s;t them. This envy has frequently re|pre&s;ented their trade as altogether pernicious, on account of the great quantities of &s;ilver, which it every year exports from the countries from which it is carried on. The parties concerned have replied, that their trade, by this continual exportation of &s;ilver, might, indeed, tend to impoveri&s;h Europe in general, but not the particular country from which it was carried on; becau&s;e, by the exportation of a part of the returns to other European countries, it annually brought home a much greater quantity of that metal than it carried out. Both the objection and the reply are founded in the popular notion which I have been ju&s;t now examining. It is, therefore, unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing further about either. By the annual exportation of &s;ilver to the Ea&s;t Indies, plate is probably &s;omewhat dearer in Europe than it other|wi&s;e might have been; and coined &s;ilver probably purcha&s;es a larger quantity both of labour and commodities. The former of the&s;e two effects is a very &s;mall lo&s;s, the latter a very &s;mall advantage; both too in&s;ignificant to de&s;erve any part of the publick attention. The trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, by opening a market to the com|modities of Europe, or, what comes nearly to the &s;ame thing, to the gold and &s;ilver which is purcha&s;ed with tho&s;e commodities, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily tend to increa&s;e the annual production of European commodities, and con&s;equently the real wealth and revenue of Europe. That it has hitherto increa&s;ed them &s;o little, is pro|bably owing to the re&s;traints which it every where labours under.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">
I THOUGHT it nece&s;&s;ary, though at the hazard of being tedious, to examine at full length this popular notion that wealth con&s;i&s;ts in money, or in gold and &s;ilver. Money in common language, as I have already ob&s;erved, frequently &s;ignifies wealth; and this ambiguity of expre&s;&s;ion has rendered this popular notion &s;o fa|miliar to us, that even they, who are convinced of its ab&s;urdity, are very apt to forget their own principles, and in the cour&s;e of their rea&s;onings to take it for granted as a certain and undeniable truth. Some of the be&s;t Engli&s;h writers upon commerce &s;et out with ob&s;erving, that the wealth of a country con&s;i&s;ts, not in its gold and &s;ilver only, but in its lands, hou&s;es, and con&s;umable goods of all different kinds. In the cour&s;e of their rea&s;onings, however, the lands, hou&s;es, and con&s;umable goods &s;eem to &s;lip out of their memory, and the &s;train of their argument frequently &s;uppo&s;es that all wealth con&s;i&s;ts in gold and &s;ilver, and that to multiply tho&s;e metals is the great object of national indu&s;try and commerce.</P>
<P>THE two principles being e&s;tabli&s;hed, however, that wealth con&s;i&s;ted in gold and &s;ilver, and that tho&s;e metals could be brought into a country which had no mines only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to a greater value than it imported; it nece&s;&s;arily became the great object of political oeconomy to dimini&s;h as much as po&s;&s;ible the importation of foreign goods for home-con&s;ump|tion, and to increa&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible the exportation of the pro|duce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try. Its two great engines for enriching the country, therefore, were re&s;traints upon importation, and en|couragements to exportation.</P>
<P>THE re&s;traints upon importation were of two kinds.</P>
<P>FIRST, re&s;traints upon the importation of &s;uch foreign goods for home-con&s;umption as could be produced at home, from what|ever country they were imported.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">
SECONDLY, re&s;traints upon the importation of goods of almo&s;t all kinds from tho&s;e particular countries with which the balance of trade was &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;advantageous.</P>
<P>THOSE different re&s;traints con&s;i&s;ted &s;ometimes in high duties, and &s;ometimes in ab&s;olute prohibitions.</P>
<P>EXPORTATION was encouraged &s;ometimes by drawbacks, &s;ome|times by bounties, &s;ometimes by advantageous treaties of com|merce with foreign &s;tates, and &s;ometimes by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of colonies in di&s;tant countries.</P>
<P>DRAWBACKS were given upon two different occa&s;ions. When the home-manufactures were &s;ubject to any duty or exci&s;e, either the whole or a part of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when foreign goods liable to a duty were im|ported, in order to be exported again, either the whole or a part of this duty was &s;ometimes given back upon &s;uch expor|tation.</P>
<P>BOUNTIES were given for the encouragement either of &s;ome beginning manufactures, or of &s;uch &s;orts of indu&s;try of other kinds as were &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;erve particular favour.</P>
<P>BY advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were procured in &s;ome foreign &s;tate for the goods and merchants of the country, beyond what were granted to tho&s;e of other countries.</P>
<P>BY the e&s;tabli&s;hment of colonies in di&s;tant countries, not only particular privileges, but a monopoly was frequently procured
<PB N="30" REF="33">
for the goods and merchants of the country which e&s;tabli&s;hed them.</P>
<P>THE two &s;orts of re&s;traints upon importation above mentioned, together with the&s;e four encouragements to exportation, con&s;titute the &s;ix principal means by which the commercial &s;y&s;tem propo&s;es to increa&s;e the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in any country by turning the balance of trade in its favour. I &s;hall con&s;ider each of them in a particular chapter, and without taking much further notice of their &s;uppo&s;ed tendency to bring money into the country, I &s;hall examine chiefly what are likely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of its indu&s;try. According as they tend either to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the value of this annual produce, they mu&s;t evidently tend either to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the real wealth and revenue of the country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of Re&s;traints upon the Importation of &s;uch Goods from Foreign Countries as can be produced at Home.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY re&s;training either by high duties or by ab&s;olute prohibitions the importation of &s;uch goods from foreign countries as can be produced at home, the monopoly of the home-market is more of le&s;s &s;ecured to the dome&s;tick indu&s;try employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of importing either live cattle or &s;alt provi&s;ions from foreign countries &s;ecures to the graziers of Great Britain the monopoly of the home-market for butchers|meat. The high duties upon the importation of corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, give a like ad|vantage to the growers of that commodity. The prohibition of the importation of foreign woollens is equally favourable to the woollen manufacturers. The &s;ilk manufacture, though altogether employed upon foreign materials, has lately obtained the &s;ame advantage. The linen manufacture has not yet obtained it, but is making great &s;trides towards it. Many other &s;orts of manu|facturers have, in the &s;ame manner, obtained in Great Britain, either altogether, or very nearly a monopoly again&s;t their coun|trymen.</P>
<P>THAT this monopoly of the home-market frequently gives great encouragement to that particular &s;pecies of indu&s;try which enjoys it, and frequently turns towards that employment a greater &s;hare of both the labour and &s;tock of the &s;ociety than would otherwi&s;e have gone to it, cannot be doubted. But whether it tends either
<PB N="32" REF="35">
to increa&s;e the general indu&s;try of the &s;ociety, or to give it the mo&s;t advantageous direction, is not, perhaps, altogether &s;o cer|tain.</P>
<P>THE general indu&s;try of the &s;ociety never can exceed what the capital of the &s;ociety can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in employment by any particular per&s;on mu&s;t bear a certain proportion to his capital, &s;o the number of tho&s;e that can be continually employed by all the members of a great &s;ociety mu&s;t bear a certain proportion to the whole capital of that &s;ociety, and never can exceed that proportion. No regulation of commerce can increa&s;e the quantity of indu&s;try in any &s;ociety beyond what its capital can maintain. It can only divert a part of it into a di|rection into which it might not otherwi&s;e have gone; and it is by no means certain that this artificial direction is likely to be more advantageous to the &s;ociety than that into which it would have gone of its own accord.</P>
<P>EVERY individual is continually exerting him&s;elf to find out the mo&s;t advantageous employment for whatever capital he can com|mand. It is his own advantage, indeed, and not that of the &s;o|ciety, which he has in view. But the &s;tudy of his own advantage naturally, or rather nece&s;&s;arily leads him to prefer that employment which is mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>FIRST, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and con&s;equently as much as he can in the &s;upport of dome&s;tick indu&s;try; provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal le&s;s than the ordinary pro|fits of &s;tock.</P>
<P>THUS upon equal or nearly equal profits, every whole&s;ale mer|chant naturally prefers the home-trade to the foreign trade of
<PB N="33" REF="36">
con&s;umption, and the foreign trade of con&s;umption to the carrying trade. In the home-trade his capital is never &s;o long out of his &s;ight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of con&s;umption. He can know better the character and &s;ituation of the per&s;ons whom he tru&s;ts, and if he &s;hould happen to be deceived, he knows better the laws of the country from which he mu&s;t &s;eek redre&s;s. In the carrying trade, the capital of the merchant is, as it were, divided between two foreign countries, and no part of it is ever nece&s;&s;arily brought home, or placed under his own immediate view and com|mand. The capital which an Am&s;terdam merchant employs in carrying corn from Konnig&s;berg to Li&s;bon, and fruit and wine from Li&s;bon to Konnig&s;berg, mu&s;t generally be the one-half of it at Konnig&s;berg and the other half at Li&s;bon. No part of it need ever come to Am&s;terdam. The natural re&s;idence of &s;uch a merchant &s;hould either be at Konnig&s;berg or Li&s;bon, and it can only be &s;ome very particular circum&s;tances which can make him prefer the re&s;idence of Am&s;terdam. The unea&s;ine&s;s, however, which he feels at being &s;eparated &s;o far from his capital, generally determines him to bring part both of the Konnig&s;berg goods which he de&s;tines for the market of Li&s;bon, and of the Li&s;bon goods which he de&s;tines for that of Konnig&s;berg, to Am&s;terdam: and though this nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjects him to a double charge of load|ing and unloading, as well as to the payment of &s;ome duties and cu&s;toms, yet for the &s;ake of having &s;ome part of his capital always under his own view and command, he willingly &s;ubmits to this extraordinary charge; and it is in this manner that every country which has any con&s;iderable &s;hare of the carrying trade becomes always the emporium or general market for the goods of all the different countries who&s;e trade it carries on. The mer|chant, in order to &s;ave a &s;econd loading and unloading, endeavours always to &s;ell in the home-market as much of the goods of all tho&s;e different countries as he can, and thus, &s;o far as he can, to
<PB N="34" REF="37">
convert his carrying trade into a foreign trade of con&s;umption. A merchant, in the &s;ame manner, who is engaged in the foreign trade of con&s;umption, when he collects goods for foreign markets, will always be glad, upon equal or nearly equal profits, to &s;ell as great a part of them at home as he can. He &s;aves him&s;elf the ri&s;k and trouble of exportation, when &s;o far as he can, he thus converts his foreign trade of con&s;umption into a home-trade. Home is in this manner the center, if I may &s;ay &s;o, round which the capitals of the inhabitants of every country are continually cir|culating, and towards which they are always tending, though by particular cau&s;es they may &s;ometimes be driven off and repelled from it towards more di&s;tant employments. But a capital em|ployed in the home-trade, it has already been &s;hown, nece&s;&s;arily puts into motion a greater quantity of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, and gives revenue and employment to a greater number of the inha|bitants of the country, than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of con&s;umption: and one employed in the foreign trade of con&s;umption has the &s;ame advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying trade. Upon equal, or only nearly equal profits, therefore, every individual naturally inclines to employ his capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greate&s;t &s;upport to dome&s;tick indu&s;try, and to give revenue and employ|ment to the greate&s;t number of the people of his own country.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, every individual who employs his capital in the &s;upport of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, nece&s;&s;arily endeavours &s;o to direct that indu&s;try, that its produce may be of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible value.</P>
<P>THE produce of indu&s;try is what it adds to the &s;ubject or ma|terials upon which it is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great or &s;mall, &s;o will likewi&s;e be the profits of the employer. But it is only for the &s;ake of profit that any man em|ploys
<PB N="35" REF="38">
a capital in the &s;upport of indu&s;try; and he will always, there|fore, endeavour to employ it in the &s;upport of that indu&s;try of which the produce is likely to be of the greate&s;t value, or to exchange for the greate&s;t quantity either of money or of other goods.</P>
<P>BUT the annual revenue of every &s;ociety is always preci&s;ely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its in|du&s;try, or rather is preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with that exchangeable value. As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the &s;upport of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, and &s;o to direct that indu&s;try that its produce may be of the greate&s;t value; every individual nece&s;&s;arily labours to render the annual re|venue of the &s;ociety as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the publick intere&s;t, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the &s;upport of dome&s;tick to that of foreign indu&s;try he intends only his own &s;ecurity; and by directing that indu&s;try in &s;uch a manner as its produce may be of the greate&s;t value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other ca&s;es, led by an invi&s;ible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the wor&s;e for the &s;ociety that it was no part of it. By pur&s;uing his own intere&s;t he frequently promotes that of the &s;ociety more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by tho&s;e who affected to trade for the publick good. It is an affec|tation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in di&s;&s;uading them from it.</P>
<P>WHAT is the &s;pecies of dome&s;tick indu&s;try which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greate&s;t value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local &s;ituation, judge much better than any &s;tate&s;man or lawgiver can do for him.
<PB N="36" REF="39">
The &s;tate&s;man, who &s;hould attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load him&s;elf with a mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary attention, but a&s;&s;ume an authority which could &s;afely be tru&s;ted, not only to no &s;ingle per&s;on, but to no council or &s;enate whatever, and which would no where be &s;o dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and pre|&s;umption enough to fancy him&s;elf fit to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P>TO give the monopoly of the home-market to the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, in any particular art or manufacture, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and mu&s;t, in almo&s;t all ca&s;es, be either a u&s;ele&s;s or a hurtful regulation. If the produce of dome&s;tick can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign indu&s;try, the regulation is evidently u&s;ele&s;s. If it cannot, it mu&s;t generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent ma&s;ter of a family, never to at|tempt to make at home what it will co&s;t him more to make than to buy. The taylor does not attempt to make his own &s;hoes, but buys them of the &s;hoemaker. The &s;hoemaker does not attempt to make his own cloaths, but employs a taylor. The farmer at|tempts to make neither the one nor the other, but employs tho&s;e different artificers. All of them find it for their intere&s;t to employ their whole indu&s;try in a way in which they have &s;ome advantage over their neighbours, and to purcha&s;e with a part of its produce, or what is the &s;ame thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever el&s;e they have occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>WHAT is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can &s;carce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign coun|try can &s;upply us with a commodity cheaper than we our&s;elves can make it, better buy it of them with &s;ome part of the pro|duce of our own indu&s;try, employed in a way in which we have
<PB N="37" REF="40">
&s;ome advantage. The general indu&s;try of the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be dimini&s;hed, no more than that of the above-mentioned artificers; but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greate&s;t advantage. It is certainly not em|ployed to the greate&s;t advantage, when it is thus directed to|wards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can make. The value of its annual produce is certainly more or le&s;s dimini&s;hed, when it is thus turned away from producing commodities evidently of more value than the commodity which it is directed to produce. According to the &s;uppo&s;ition, that commodity could be purcha&s;ed from foreign countries cheaper than it can be made at home. It could, therefore, have been purcha&s;ed with a part only of the commodities, or, what is the &s;ame thing, with a part only of the price of the commodities, which the indu&s;try employed by an equal capital, would have produced at home, had it been left to follow its natural cour&s;e. The indu&s;try of the country, therefore, is thus turned away from a more, to a le&s;s advantageous employment, and the exchangeable value of its annual produce, in&s;tead of being increa&s;ed, according to the intention of the lawgiver, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be dimini&s;hed by every &s;uch regulation.</P>
<P>BY means of &s;uch regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may &s;ometimes be acquired &s;ooner than it could have been otherwi&s;e, and after a certain time may be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in the foreign country. But though the indu&s;try of the &s;ociety may be thus carried with advantage into a particular channel &s;ooner than it could have been otherwi&s;e, it will by no means follow that the &s;um total either of its indu&s;try or of its revenue can ever be augmented by any &s;uch regulation. The indu&s;try of the &s;ociety can augment only in proportion as its capital augments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to what can be gradually &s;aved out of its revenue. But the immediate effect of
<PB N="38" REF="41">
every &s;uch regulation is to dimini&s;h its revenue, and what dimini&s;hes its revenue, is certainly not very likely to augment its capital fa&s;ter than it would have augmented of its own accord, had both capital and indu&s;try been left to find out their natural employments.</P>
<P>THOUGH for want of &s;uch regulations the &s;ociety &s;hould never acquire the propo&s;ed manufacture, it would not, upon that account, nece&s;&s;arily be the poorer in any one period of its duration. In every period of its duration its whole capital and indu&s;try might &s;till have been employed, though upon different objects, in the manner that was mo&s;t advantageous at the time. In every period its revenue might have been the greate&s;t which its capital could afford, and both capital and revenue might have been augmenting with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible rapidity.</P>
<P>THE natural advantages which one country has over another in producing particular commodities are &s;ometimes &s;o great, that it is acknowledged by all the world to be in vain to &s;truggle with them, By means of gla&s;&s;es, hotbeds, and hotwalls, very good grapes can be rai&s;ed in Scotland, and very good wine too can be made of them at about thirty times the expence for which at lea&s;t equally good can be brought from foreign countries. Would it be a rea&s;onable law to prohibit the importation of all foreign wines, merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in Scotland? But if there would be a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity in turning towards any em|ployment, thirty times more of the capital and indu&s;try of the country, than would be nece&s;&s;ary to purcha&s;e from foreign countries an equal quantity of the commodities wanted, there mu&s;t be an ab&s;urdity, though not altogether &s;o glaring, yet exactly of the &s;ame kind, in turning towards any &s;uch employment a thirtieth, or even a three hundredth part more of either. Whether the ad|vantages which one country has over another, be natural or ac|quired,
<PB N="39" REF="42">
is in this re&s;pect of no con&s;equence. As long as the one country has tho&s;e advantages, and the other wants them, it will always be more advantageous for the latter, rather to buy of the former than to make. It is an acquired advantage only, which one artificer has over his neighbour, who exerci&s;es another trade, and yet they both find it more advantageous to buy of one ano|ther, than to make what does not belong to their particular trades.</P>
<P>MERCHANTS and manufacturers are the people who derive the greate&s;t advantage from this monopoly of the home market. The prohibition of the importation of foreign cattle, and of &s;alt provi&s;ions, together with the high duties upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, are not near &s;o advantageous to the graziers and farmers of Great Britain, as other regulations of the &s;ame kind are to its merchants and manu|facturers. Manufactures, tho&s;e of the finer kind e&s;pecially, are more ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from one country to another than corn or cattle. It is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accord|ingly, that foreign trade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very &s;mall advantage will enable foreigners to under&s;ell our own workmen, even in the home market. It will require a very great one to enable them to do &s;o in the rude produce of the &s;oil. If the free importation of foreign manufactures was permitted, &s;everal of the home manufactures would probably &s;uffer, and &s;ome of of them, perhaps, go to ruin altogether, and a con&s;iderable part of the &s;tock and indu&s;try at pre&s;ent employed in them, would be forced to find out &s;ome other employment. But the free&s;t im|portation of the rude produce of the &s;oil could have no &s;uch effect upon the agriculture of the country.</P>
<P>IF the importation of foreign cattle, for example, was made ever &s;o free, &s;o few could be imported, that the grazing trade of Great
<PB N="40" REF="43">
Britain could be little affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of which the tran&s;portation is more expen&s;ive by &s;ea than by land. By land they carry them&s;elves to market. By &s;ea, not only the cattle, but their food and their water too mu&s;t be carried at no &s;mall expence and inconveniency. The &s;hort &s;ea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed, renders the importation of Iri&s;h cattle more ea&s;y. But thought the free importation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time, were rendered perpetual, it could have no con&s;iderable effect upon the intere&s;t of the graziers of Great Britain. Tho&s;e parts of Great Britain which border upon the Iri&s;h &s;ea are all grazing countries. Iri&s;h cattle could never be imported for their u&s;e, but mu&s;t be drove through tho&s;e very exten&s;ive countries, at no &s;mall expence and in|conveniency, before they could arrive at their proper market. Fat cattle could not be drove &s;o far. Lean cattle, therefore, only could be imported, and &s;uch importation could interfere, not with the intere&s;t of the feeding or fattening countries, to which by reducing the price of lean cattle, it would rather be advantageous, but with that of the breeding countries only. The &s;mall number of Iri&s;h cattle imported &s;ince their importation was permitted, together with the good price at which lean cattle &s;till continue to &s;ell, &s;eem to demon&s;trate that even the breeding countries of Great Britain are never likely to be much affected by the free importation of Iri&s;h cattle. The common people of Ireland, indeed, are &s;aid to have &s;ometimes oppo&s;ed with violence the exportation of their cattle. But if the exporters had found any great advantage in continuing the trade, they could ea&s;ily, when the law was on their &s;ide, have conquered this mobbi&s;h oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FEEDING and fattening countries, be&s;ides, mu&s;t always be highly improved, whereas breeding countries are generally un|cultivated. The high price of lean cattle, by augmenting the value
<PB N="41" REF="44">
of uncultivated land, is like a bounty again&s;t improvement. To any country which was highly improved throughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than to breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is &s;aid to follow this maxim at pre&s;ent. The mountains of Scotland, Wales, and Northumberland, indeed, are countries not capable of much im|provement, and &s;eem de&s;tined by nature to be the breeding coun|tries of Great Britain. The free&s;t importation of foreign cattle could have no other effect than to hinder tho&s;e breeding countries from taking advantage of the increa&s;ing population and improve|ment of the re&s;t of the kingdom, from rai&s;ing their price to an exorbitant height, and from laying a real tax upon all the more improved and cultivated parts of the country.</P>
<P>THE free&s;t importation of &s;alt provi&s;ions, in the &s;ame manner, could have as little effect upon the intere&s;t of the graziers of Great Britain as that of live cattle. Salt provi&s;ions are not only a very bulky commodity, but when compared with fre&s;h meat, they are a commodity both of wor&s;e quality, and as they co&s;t more labour and expence, of higher price. They could never, therefore, come into competition with the fre&s;h meat, though they might with the &s;alt provi&s;ions of the country. They might be u&s;ed for victualling &s;hips for di&s;tant voyages, and &s;uch like u&s;es, but could never make any con&s;iderable part of the food of the people. The &s;mall quantity of &s;alt provi&s;ions imported from Ire|land &s;ince their importation was rendered free, is an experimental proof that our graziers have nothing to apprehend from it. It does not appear that the price of butcher's-meat has ever been &s;en&s;ibly affected by it.</P>
<P>EVEN the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the intere&s;t of the farmers of Great Britain. Corn is a much more bulky commodity than butcher's-meat. A pound of
<PB N="42" REF="45">
wheat at a penny is as dear as a pound of butcher's-meat at four|pence. The &s;mall quantity of foreign corn imported even in times of the greate&s;t &s;carcity, may &s;atisfy our farmers that they can have nothing to fear from the free&s;t importation. The average quantity imported, one year with another, amounts only, according to the very well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade, to twenty-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-eight quarters of all &s;orts of grain, and does not exceed the five hundredth and &s;eventy-one part of the annual con&s;umption. But as the bounty upon corn occa&s;ions a greater exportation in years of plenty, &s;o it mu&s;t of con&s;equence occa&s;ion a greater importation in years of &s;carcity, than would otherwi&s;e take place. By means of it, the plenty of one year does not compen&s;ate the &s;carcity of another, and as the average quantity exported is nece&s;&s;arily aug|mented by it, &s;o mu&s;t likewi&s;e, in the actual &s;tate of tillage, the average quantity imported. If there was no bounty, as le&s;s corn would be exported, &s;o it is probable that one year with another, le&s;s would be imported than at pre&s;ent. The corn merchants, the fetchers and carriers of corn, between Great Britain and foreign countries, would have much le&s;s employment, and might &s;uffer con&s;iderably; but the country gentlemen and farmers could &s;uffer very little. It is in the corn merchants accordingly, rather than in the country gentlemen and farmers, that I have ob&s;erved the greate&s;t anxiety for the renewal and continuation of the bounty.</P>
<P>COUNTRY gentlemen and farmers are, to their great honour, of all people, the lea&s;t &s;ubject to the wretched &s;pirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a great manufactory is &s;ometimes alarmed if another work of the &s;ame kind is e&s;tabli&s;hed within twenty miles of him. The Dutch undertaker of the woollen manufacture at Abbeville, &s;tipulated that no work of the &s;ame kind &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed within thirty leagues of that city. Farmers and country
<PB N="43" REF="46">
gentlemen, on the contrary, are generally di&s;po&s;ed rather to promote than to ob&s;truct the cultivation and improvement of their neigh|bours farms and e&s;tates. They have no &s;ecrets, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the greater part of manufacturers, but are generally rather fond of communicating to their neighbours, and of extending as far as po&s;&s;ible any new practice which they have found to be advan|tageous. <HI>Pius Que&s;tus,</HI> &s;ays old Cato, <HI>&s;tabili&s;&s;imu&s;que, minime|que invidio&s;us; minimeque male cogitantes &s;unt, qui in eo &s;tudio occupati &s;unt.</HI> Country gentleman and farmers, di&s;per&s;ed in dif|ferent parts of the country, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily combine as merchants and manufacturers, who being collected into towns, and accu&s;tomed to that exclu&s;ive corporation &s;pirit which prevails in them, na|turally endeavour to obtain again&s;t all their countrymen, the &s;ame exclu&s;ive privilege which they generally po&s;&s;e&s;s again&s;t the inhabitants of their re&s;pective towns. They accordingly &s;eem to have been the original inventors of tho&s;e re&s;traints upon the im|portation of foreign goods, which &s;ecure to them the monopoly of the home market. It was probably in imitation of them, and to put them&s;elves upon a level with tho&s;e, who, they found were di&s;po&s;ed to oppre&s;s them, that the country gentlemen and farmers of Great Britain &s;o far forgot the genero&s;ity which is na|tural to their &s;tation, as to demand the exclu&s;ive privilege of &s;upplying their countrymen with corn and butcher's-meat. They did not perhaps take time to con&s;ider, how much le&s;s their intere&s;t could be affected by the freedom of trade, than that of the people who&s;e example they followed.</P>
<P>TO prohibit by a perpetual law the importation of foreign corn and cattle, is in reality to enact, that the population and indu&s;try of the country &s;hall at no time exceed what the rude produce of its own &s;oil can maintain.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">
THERE &s;eem, however, to be two ca&s;es in which it will generally be advantageous to lay &s;ome burden upon foreign, for the encou|ragement of dome&s;tick indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is when &s;ome particular &s;ort of indu&s;try is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the country. The defence of Great Britain, for example, depends very much upon the number of its &s;ailors and &s;hipping. The act of navigation, therefore, very properly endeavours to give the &s;ailors and &s;hipping of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country, in &s;ome ca&s;es, by ab&s;olute prohibitions, and in others by heavy burdens upon the &s;hipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal di&s;po&s;itions of this act:</P>
<P>FIRST, all &s;hips, of which the owners, ma&s;ters, and three|fourths of the mariners are not Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, are prohibited, upon pain of forfeiting &s;hip and cargo, from trading to the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements and plantations, or from being employed in the coa&s;t|ing trade of Great Britain.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, a great variety of the mo&s;t bulky articles of im|portation can be brought into Great Britain only, either in &s;uch &s;hips as are above de&s;cribed, or in &s;hips of the country where tho&s;e goods are produced, and of which the owners, ma&s;ters, and three-fourths of the mariners are of that particular country; and when imported even in &s;hips of this latter kind, they are &s;ubject to double aliens duty. If imported in &s;hips of any other country, the penalty is forfeiture of &s;hip and cargo. When this act was made, the Dutch were, what they &s;till are, the great carriers of Europe, and by this regulation they were entirely excluded from being the carriers to Great Britain, or from importing to us the goods of any other European country.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">
THIRDLY, a great variety of the mo&s;t bulky articles of im|portation are prohibited from being imported, even in Briti&s;h &s;hips, from any country but that in which they are produced; under pain of forfeiting &s;hip and cargo. This regulation too was probably intended again&s;t the Dutch. Holland was then, as now, the great emporium for all European goods, and by this regulation, Briti&s;h &s;hips were hindered from loading in Holland the goods of any other European country.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, &s;alt fi&s;h of all kinds, whale-fins, whale-bone, oil and blubber, not caught by and cured on board Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, when imported into Great Britain, are &s;ubjected to double aliens duty. The Dutch, as they are &s;till the principal, were then the only fi&s;hers in Europe that attempted to &s;upply foreign nations with fi&s;h. By this regulation, a very heavy burden was laid upon their &s;upplying Great Britain.</P>
<P>WHEN the act of navigation was made, though England and Holland were not actually at war, the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations. It had begun during the government of the long parliament which fir&s;t framed this act, and it broke out &s;oon after in the Dutch wars during that of the Protector and of Charles the IId. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that &s;ome of the regulations of this famous act may have proceeded from national animo&s;ity. They are as wi&s;e, however, as if they had all been dictated by the mo&s;t deliberate wi&s;dom. National ani|mo&s;ity at that particular time aimed at the very &s;ame object which the mo&s;t deliberate wi&s;dom would have recommended, the dimi|nution of the naval power of Holland, the only naval power which could endanger the &s;ecurity of England.</P>
<P>THE act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the growth of that opulence which can ari&s;e from it. The
<PB N="46" REF="49">
intere&s;t of a nation in its commercial relations to foreign nations is, like that of a merchant with regard to the different people with whom he deals, to buy as cheap and to &s;ell as dear as po&s;&s;ible. But it will be mo&s;t likely to buy cheap, when by the mo&s;t perfect free|dom of trade it encourages all nations to bring to it the goods which it has occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it will be mo&s;t likely to &s;ell dear, when its markets are thus filled with the greate&s;t number of buyers. The act of navigation, it is true, lays no burden upon foreign &s;hips that come to export the produce of Briti&s;h indu&s;try. Even the antient aliens duty, which u&s;ed to be paid upon all goods exported as well as imported, has, by &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent acts, been taken off from the greater part of the articles of exportation. But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high duties, are hindered from coming to &s;ell, they cannot always afford to come to buy; becau&s;e coming without a cargo, they mu&s;t lo&s;e the freight from their own country to Great Britain. By dimini&s;hing the number of &s;ellers, therefore, we nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h that of buyers, and are thus likely not only to buy foreign goods dearer, but to &s;ell our own cheaper, than if there was a more perfect freedom of trade. As defence, however, is of much more importance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the wi&s;e&s;t of all the commercial regulations of England.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd ca&s;e, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay &s;ome burden upon foreign for the encouragement of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, is, when &s;ome tax is impo&s;ed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this ca&s;e, it &s;eems rea&s;onable that an equal tax &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon the like produce of the former. This would not give the monopoly of the home market to dome&s;tick indu&s;try, nor turn towards a particular employment a greater &s;hare of the &s;tock and labour of the country, than what would naturally go to it. It would only hinder any part of what would naturally
<PB N="47" REF="50">
go to it from being turned away by the tax, into a le&s;s natural direction, and would leave the competition between foreign and dome&s;tick indu&s;try, after the tax, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible upon the &s;ame footing as before it. In Great Britain, when any &s;uch tax is laid upon the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, it is u&s;ual at the &s;ame time, in order to &s;top the clamorous complaints of our merchants and manufacturers, that they will be under&s;old at home, to lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>THIS &s;econd limitation of the freedom of trade according to &s;ome people &s;hould, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, be extended much further than to the preci&s;e foreign commodities which could come into competition with tho&s;e which had been taxed at home. When the nece&s;&s;aries of life have been taxed in any country, it becomes proper, they pretend, to tax not only the like nece&s;&s;aries of life imported from other countries, but all &s;orts of foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try. Sub&s;i&s;tence, they &s;ay, becomes nece&s;&s;arily dearer in con&s;equence of &s;uch taxes; and the price of labour mu&s;t always ri&s;e with the price of the labourers &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every com|modity, therefore, which is the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, though not immediately taxed it&s;elf, becomes dearer in con&s;equence of &s;uch taxes, becau&s;e the labour which produces it becomes &s;o. Such taxes, therefore, are really equivalent, they &s;ay, to a tax upon every particular commodity produced at home. In order to put dome&s;tick upon the &s;ame footing with foreign indu&s;try, therefore, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, they think, to lay &s;ome duty upon every foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities with which it can come into com|petition.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">
WHETHER taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;uch as tho&s;e in Great Britain upon malt, beer, &s;oap, &s;alt, leather, candles, &amp;c. nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e the price of labour, and con&s;equently that of all other commodities, I &s;hall con&s;ider hereafter, when I come to treat of taxes. Suppo&s;ing, however, in the mean time, that they have this effect, and they have it undoubtedly, this general enhancement of the price of all commodities, in con&s;equence of that of labour, is a ca&s;e which differs in the two following re&s;pects from that of a particular commodity, of which the price was enhanced by a particular tax immediately impo&s;ed upon it.</P>
<P>FIRST, it might always be known with great exactne&s;s how far the price of &s;uch a commodity could be enhanced by &s;uch a tax: but how far the general enhancement of the price of labour might affect that of every different commodity, about which labour was employed, could never be known with any tolerable exactne&s;s. It would be impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, to proportion with any tolerable exactne&s;s the tax upon every foreign to this enhancement of the price of every home commodity.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life have nearly the &s;ame effect upon the circum&s;tances of the people as a poor &s;oil and a bad climate. Provi&s;ions are thereby rendered dearer in the &s;ame manner as if it required extraordinary labour and expence to rai&s;e them. As in the natural &s;carcity ari&s;ing from &s;oil and cli|mate, it would be ab&s;urd to direct the people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and indu&s;try, &s;o it is likewi&s;e in the artificial &s;carcity ari&s;ing from &s;uch taxes. To be left to accommo|date, as well as they could, their indu&s;try to their &s;ituation, and to find out tho&s;e employments in which, notwith&s;tanding their un|favourable circum&s;tances, they might have &s;ome advantage either in
<PB N="49" REF="52">
the home, or in the foreign market, is what in both ca&s;es, would evidently be mo&s;t for their advantage. To lay a new tax upon them, becau&s;e they are already overburdened with taxes, and becau&s;e they already pay too dear for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, to make them likewi&s;e pay too dear for the greater part of other commodities, is certainly a mo&s;t ab&s;urd way of making amends.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a cur&s;e equal to the barrenne&s;s of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens; and yet it is in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t indu&s;trious coun|tries that they have been mo&s;t generally impo&s;ed. No other coun|tries could &s;upport &s;o great a di&s;order. As the &s;tronge&s;t bodies only can live and enjoy health, under an unwhole&s;ome regimen; &s;o the nations only, that in every &s;ort of indu&s;try have the greate&s;t natural and acquired advantages, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t and pro&s;per under &s;uch taxes. Holland is the country in Europe in which they abound mo&s;t, and which from peculiar circum&s;tances continues to pro&s;per, not by means of them, as has been mo&s;t ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ed, but in &s;pite of them.</P>
<P>As there are two ca&s;es in which it will generally be advantage|ous to lay &s;ome burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of dome&s;tick indu&s;try; &s;o there are two others in which it may &s;ome|times be a matter of deliberation; in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods; and in the other, how far or in what manner it may be proper to re&s;tore that free importation after it has been for &s;ome time interrupted.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e in which it may &s;ometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods, is, when &s;ome foreign nation re&s;trains by high duties or prohibitions the importation of &s;omeof our manufactures into
<PB N="50" REF="53">
their country. Revenge in this ca&s;e naturally dictates retaliation, and that we &s;hould impo&s;e the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of &s;ome or all of their manufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, &s;eldom fail to retaliate in this manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their own manufactures by re&s;training the importation of &s;uch foreign goods as could come into competition with them. In this con&s;i&s;ted a great part of the policy of Mr. Colbert, who, notwith&s;tanding his great abilities, &s;eems in this ca&s;e to have been impo&s;ed upon by the &s;ophi&s;try of merchants and manufacturers, who are always demand|ing a monopoly again&s;t their countrymen. It is at pre&s;ent the opinion of the mo&s;t intelligent men in France that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his country. That mini&s;ter by the tarif of 1667, impo&s;ed very high duties upon a great num|ber of foreign manufactures. Upon his refu&s;ing to moderate them in favour of the Dutch, they in 1671 prohibited the importation of the wines, brandies, and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 &s;eems to have been in part occa&s;ioned by this commercial di&s;pute. The peace of Nimeguen put an end to it in 1678, by moderating &s;ome of tho&s;e duties in favour of the Dutch, who in con&s;equence took off their prohibition. It was about the &s;ame time that the French and Engli&s;h began mutually to oppre&s;s each other's indu&s;try, by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the French, however, &s;eem to have &s;et the fir&s;t example. The &s;pirit of ho&s;|tility which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations ever &s;ince, has hitherto hindered them from being moderated on either &s;ide. In 1697 the Engli&s;h prohibited the importation of bonelace, the manufacture of Flanders. The government of that country, at that time under the dominion of Spain, prohibited in return the importation of Engli&s;h woollens. In 1700, the prohibition of importing bonelace into England, was taken off upon condition that the importation of Engli&s;h woollens into Flanders &s;hould be put on the &s;ame footing as before.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">
THERE may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compen&s;ate the tran&s;itory inconveniency of paying dearer during a &s;hort time for &s;ome &s;orts of goods. To judge whether &s;uch retaliations are likely to produce &s;uch an effect, does not, perhaps, belong &s;o much to the &s;cience of a legi&s;lator, who&s;e deliberations ought to be governed by general principles which are always the &s;ame, as to the &s;kill of that in|&s;idious and crafty animal, vulgarly called a &s;tate&s;man or politician, who&s;e councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs. When there is no probability that any &s;uch repeal can be procured, it &s;eems a bad method of compen&s;ating the injury done to certain cla&s;&s;es of our people, to do another injury our&s;elves both to tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es and to almo&s;t all the other cla&s;&s;es of them. When our neighbours prohibit &s;ome manufacture of ours, we generally pro|hibit, not only the &s;ame, for that alone would &s;eldom affect them con&s;iderably, but &s;ome other manufacture of theirs. This may no doubt give encouragement to &s;ome particular cla&s;s of workmen among our&s;elves, and by excluding &s;ome of their rivals, may en|able them to rai&s;e their price in the home market. Tho&s;e work|men, however, who &s;uffered by our neighbours prohibition will not be benefited by ours. On the contrary, they, and almo&s;t all the other cla&s;&s;es of our citizens will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods. Every &s;uch law, therefore, impo&s;es a real tax upon the whole country, not in favour of that particular cla&s;s of workmen who were injured by our neighbours prohibition, but of &s;ome other cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e in which it may &s;ometimes be a matter of deliberation how far or in what manner it is proper to re&s;tore the free impor|tation of foreign goods, after it has been for &s;ome time interrupted,
<PB N="52" REF="55">
is, when particular manufactures, by means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign goods which can come into compe|tition with them, have been &s;o far extended as to employ a great multitude of hands. Humanity may in this ca&s;e require that the freedom of trade &s;hould be re&s;tored only by &s;low gradations, and with a good deal of re&s;erve and circum&s;pection. Were tho&s;e high duties and prohibitions taken away all at once, cheaper foreign goods of the &s;ame kind might be poured &s;o fa&s;t into the home market, as to deprive all at once many thou&s;ands of our people of their or|dinary employment and means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The di&s;order which this would occa&s;ion might no doubt be very con&s;iderable. It would in all probability, however, be much le&s;s than is commonly ima|gined, for the two following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>FIRST, all tho&s;e manufactures, of which any part is commonly exported to other European countries without a bounty, could be very little affected by the free&s;t importation of foreign goods. Such manufactures mu&s;t be &s;old as cheap abroad as any other foreign goods of the &s;ame quality and kind, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be &s;old cheaper at home. They would &s;till, therefore, keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the home market, and though a capricious man of fa&s;hion might &s;ometimes prefer foreign wares, merely becau&s;e they were foreign, to cheaper and better goods of the &s;ame kind that were made at home, this folly could from the nature of things extend to &s;o few, that it could make no &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion upon the general employment of the people. But a great part of all the different branches of our woollen manufacture, of our tanned leather, and of our hard|ware, are annually exported to other European countries without any bounty, and the&s;e are the manufactures which employ the greate&s;t number of hands. The &s;ilk, perhaps, is the manufacture which would &s;uffer the mo&s;t by this freedom of trade, and after it the linen, though the latter much le&s;s than the former.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56">
SECONDLY, though a great number of people &s;hould, by thus re&s;toring the freedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment and common method of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, it would by no means follow that they would thereby be deprived either of employment or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. By the reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war more than a hundred thou&s;and &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, a number equal to what is employed in the greate&s;t manu|factures, were all at once thrown out of their ordinary employ|ment; but, though they no doubt &s;uffered &s;ome inconveniency, they were not thereby deprived of all employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The greater part of the &s;eamen, it is probable, gradually betook them&s;elves to the merchants &s;ervice as they could find occa&s;ion, and in the mean time both they and the &s;oldiers were ab&s;orbed in the great ma&s;s of the people, and employed in a great variety of occupations. Not only no great convul&s;ion, but no &s;en&s;ible di&s;|order aro&s;e from &s;o great a change in the &s;ituation of more than a hundred thou&s;and men, all accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of arms, and many of them to rapine and plunder. The number of vagrants was &s;carce anywhere &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed by it, even the wages of labour were not reduced by it in any occupation, &s;o far as I have been able to learn, except in that of &s;eamen in the merchant &s;er|vice. But if we compare together the habits of a &s;oldier and of any &s;ort of manufacturer, we &s;hall find that tho&s;e of the latter do not tend &s;o much to di&s;qualify him from being employed in a new trade, as tho&s;e of the former from being employed in any. The manufacturer has always been accu&s;tomed to look for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from his labour only: the &s;oldier to expect it from his pay. Appli|cation and indu&s;try have been familiar to the one; idlene&s;s and di&s;|&s;ipation to the other. But it is &s;urely much ea&s;ier to change the direction of indu&s;try from one &s;ort of labour to another, than to turn idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation to any. To the greater part of manufactures be&s;ides, it has already been ob&s;erved, there are other
<PB N="54" REF="57">
collateral manufactures of &s;o &s;imilar a nature, that a workman can ea&s;ily transfer his indu&s;try from one of them to another. The greater part of &s;uch workmen too are occa&s;ionally employed in country labour. The &s;tock which employed them in a particular manufacture before, will &s;till remain in the country to employ an equal number of people in &s;ome other way. The capital of the country remaining the &s;ame, the demand for labour will likewi&s;e be the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame, though it may be exerted in different places and for different occupations. Soldiers and &s;ea|men, indeed, when di&s;charged from the kings &s;ervice, are at liberty to exerci&s;e any trade, within any town or place of Great Britain or Ireland. Let the &s;ame natural liberty of exerci&s;ing what &s;pecies of indu&s;try they plea&s;e be re&s;tored to all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, in the &s;ame manner as to &s;oldiers and &s;eamen; that is, break down the exclu&s;ive privileges of corporations, and repeal the &s;tatute of apprentice&s;hip, both which are real encroachments upon natural liberty, and add to the&s;e the repeal of the law of &s;ettlements, &s;o that a poor workman, when thrown out of employment either in one trade or in one place, may &s;eek for it in another trade or in another place, without the fear either of a pro&s;ecution or of a removal, and neither the publick nor the individuals will &s;uffer much more from the occa&s;ional di&s;banding &s;ome particular cla&s;&s;es of manufacturers, than from that of &s;oldiers. Our manufacturers have no doubt great merit with their country, but they cannot have more than tho&s;e who defend it with their blood, nor de&s;erve to be treated with more delicacy.</P>
<P>To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade &s;hould ever be entirely re&s;tored in Great Britain, is as ab&s;urd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopea &s;hould ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. Not only the prejudices of the publick, but what is much more unconquerable, the private intere&s;ts of many individuals irre&s;i&s;tably oppo&s;e it. Were the

This monopoly has &s;o much increa&s;ed the number of &s;ome particular tribes of them, that, like an overgrown &s;tand|ing army, they have become formidable to the government, and upon many occa&s;ions intimidate the legi&s;lature. The member of parliament who &s;upports every propo&s;al for &s;trongthening this mo|nopoly, is &s;ure to acquire not only the reputation of under&s;tanding trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men who&s;e numbers and wealth render them of great importance. If he oppo&s;es them, on the contrary, and &s;till more if he has authority enough to be able to thwart them, neither the mo&s;t acknowledged probity, nor the highe&s;t rank, nor the greate&s;t publick &s;ervices can protect him from the mo&s;t infamous abu&s;e and detraction, from per&s;onal in&s;ults, nor &s;ometimes from real danger, ari&s;ing from the in&s;olent outrage of furious and di&s;appointed monopoli&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE undertaker of a great manufacture who, by the home markets being &s;uddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, &s;hould be obliged to abandon his trade, would no doubt &s;uffer very con&s;iderably. That part of his capital which had u&s;ually been employed in purcha&s;ing materials and in paying his workmen, might, without much difficulty, perhaps, find another employment. But that part of it which was fixed in workhou&s;es, and in the in|&s;truments of trade, could &s;carce be di&s;po&s;ed of without con&s;iderable

lo&s;s. The equitable regard, therefore, to his intere&s;t requires that changes of this kind &s;hould never be introduced &s;uddenly, but &s;lowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The legi&s;lature were it po&s;&s;ible that its deliberations could be always directed, not by the clamorous importunity of partial intere&s;ts, but by an exten&s;ive view of the general good, ought upon this very account perhaps, to be particularly careful neither to e&s;tabli&s;h any new monopolies of this kind, nor to extend further tho&s;e which are already e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>HOW far it may be proper to impo&s;e taxes upon the importation of foreign goods, in order, not to prevent their importation, but to rai&s;e a revenue for government, I &s;hall con&s;ider hereafter when I come to treat of taxes.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the extraordinary Re&s;traints upon the Importation of Goods of almo&s;t all Kinds, from tho&s;e Countries with which the Balance is &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;advantageous.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO lay extraordinary re&s;traints upon the importation of goods of almo&s;t all kinds, from tho&s;e particular countries with which the balance of trade is &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;advantageous, is the &s;econd expedient by which the commercial &s;y&s;tem propo&s;es to in|crea&s;e the quantity of gold and &s;ilver. Thus in Great Britain higher duties are laid upon the wines of France than upon tho&s;e of Portugal. German linen may be imported upon paying certain duties; but French linen is altogether prohibited. The principles which I have been examining, took their origin from private intere&s;t and the &s;pirit of monopoly: tho&s;e which I am going to examine from national prejudice and animo&s;ity. They are, accordingly, as might well be expected, &s;till more unrea&s;onable. They are &s;o, even upon the principles of the commercial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>FIRST, though it were certain that in the ca&s;e of a free trade between France and England, for example, the balance would be in favour of France, it would by no means follow that &s;uch a trade would be di&s;advantageous to England, or that the general balance of its whole trade would thereby be turned more again&s;t it. If the wines of France are better and cheaper than tho&s;e of Portugal, or its linens than tho&s;e of Germany, it would be more advantageous for Great Britain to purcha&s;e both the wine and the foreign linen which it had occa&s;ion for of France, than of Portugal and Ger|many. Though the value of the annual importations from France would thereby be greatly augmented, the value of the whole annual importations would be dimini&s;hed, in proportion as the French
<PB N="58" REF="61">
goods of the &s;ame quality were cheaper than tho&s;e of the other two countries. This would be the ca&s;e, even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the whole French goods imported were to be con&s;umed in Great Britain.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;econdly, a great part of them might be re-exported to other countries, where, being &s;old with profit, they might bring back a return equal in value, perhaps, to the prime co&s;t of the whole French goods imported. What has frequently been &s;aid of the Ea&s;t India trade might po&s;&s;ibly be true of the French; that though the greater part of Ea&s;t India goods were bought with gold and &s;ilver, the re-exportation of a part of them to other countries, brought back more gold and &s;ilver to that which carried on the trade than the prime co&s;t of the whole amounted to. One of the mo&s;t important branches of the Dutch trade, at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts in the carriage of French goods to other European countries. A great part even of the French wine drank in Great Britain is clande&s;tinely imported from Holland and Zealand. If there was either a free trade between France and England, or if French goods could be imported upon paying only the &s;ame duties as tho&s;e of other Euro|pean nations, to be drawn back upon exportation, England might have &s;ome &s;hare of a trade which is found &s;o advantageous to Holland.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, there is no certain criterion by which we can determine on which &s;ide what is called the balance between any two countries lies, or which of them exports to the greate&s;t value. National prejudice and animo&s;ity, prompted always by the private intere&s;t of particular traders, are the principles which generally di|rect our judgement upon all que&s;tions concerning it. There are two criterions, however, which have frequently been appealed to upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books and the cour&s;e of ex|change.
<PB N="59" REF="62">
The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books, I think, it is now generally ac|knowledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of the inac|curacy of the valuation at which the greater part of goods are rated in them. The cour&s;e of exchange, at lea&s;t, as it has hitherto been e&s;timated, is, perhaps, almo&s;t equally &s;o.</P>
<P>WHEN the exchange between two places, &s;uch as London and Paris, is at par, it is &s;aid to be a &s;ign that the debts due from Lon|don to Paris are compen&s;ated by tho&s;e due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when a premium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is &s;aid to be a &s;ign that the debts due from London to Paris are not compen&s;ated by tho&s;e due from Paris to London, but that a balance in money mu&s;t be &s;ent out from the latter place; for the ri&s;k, trouble, and expence of exporting which, the pre|mium is both demanded and given. But the ordinary &s;tate of debt and credit between tho&s;e two cities mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be regulated, it is &s;aid, by the ordinary cour&s;e of their dealings with one another. When neither of them imports from the other to a greater amount than it exports to it, the debts and credits of each may compen&s;ate one another. But when one of them imports from the other to a greater value than it exports to it, the former nece&s;&s;arily becomes indebted to the latter in a greater &s;um than the latter becomes in|debted to it: the debts and credits of each do not compen&s;ate one another, and money mu&s;t be &s;ent out from that place of which the debts over-balance the credits. The common cour&s;e of ex|change, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary &s;tate of debt and credit between two places, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be an indication of the ordinary cour&s;e of their exports and imports, as the&s;e nece&s;&s;a|rily regulate that &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT though this doctrine, of which &s;ome part is, perhaps, not a little doubtful, were &s;uppo&s;ed ever &s;o certain, the manner in which the par of exchange has hitherto been computed, renders uncer|tain every conclu&s;ion that has ever yet been drawn from it.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">
WHEN for a &s;um of money paid in England, containing, accord|ing to the &s;tandard of the Engli&s;h mint, a certain number of ounces of pure &s;ilver, you receive a bill for a &s;um of money to be paid in France, containing, according to the &s;tandard of the French mint, an equal number of ounces of pure &s;ilver, exchange is &s;aid to be at par between England and France. When you pay more, you are &s;uppo&s;ed to give a premium, and exchange is &s;aid to be again&s;t England, and in favour of France. When you pay le&s;s, you are &s;uppo&s;ed to get a premium, and exchange is &s;aid to be again&s;t France, and in favour of England.</P>
<P>BUT, fir&s;t we cannot always judge of the value of the current money of different countries by the &s;tandards of their re&s;pective mints. In &s;ome it is more, in others it is le&s;s worn, clipt, and otherwi&s;e degenerated from that &s;tandard. But the value of the current coin of every country, compared with that of any other country, is in proportion, not to the quantity of pure &s;ilver which it ought to contain, but to that which it actually does contain. Before the reformation of the &s;ilver coin in king William's time, exchange between England and Holland, computed, in the u&s;ual manner, according to the &s;tandards of their re&s;pective mints, was five and twenty per cent. again&s;t England. But the value of the cur|rent coin of England, as we learn from Mr. Lowndes, was at that time rather more than five and twenty per cent. below its &s;tandard value. The real exchange, therefore, may even at that time have been in favour of England, notwith&s;tanding the computed exchange was &s;o much again&s;t it; a &s;maller number of ounces of pure &s;ilver, actually paid in England, may have purcha&s;ed a bill for a greater number of ounces of pure &s;ilver to be paid in Holland, and the man who was &s;uppo&s;ed to give, may in reality have got the premium. The French coin was, before the late reformation of the Engli&s;h gold coin, much le&s;s worn than the Engli&s;h, and was, perhaps, two or
<PB N="61" REF="64">
three per cent. nearer its &s;tandard. If the computed exchange with France, therefore, was not more than two or three per cent. again&s;t England, the real exchange might have been in its favour. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the exchange has been con|&s;tantly in favour of England, and again&s;t France.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, in &s;ome countries, the expence of coinage is defrayed by the government, in others, it is defrayed by the private people who carry their bullion to the mint, and the government even de|rives &s;ome revenue from the coinage. In England, it is defrayed by the government, and if you carry a pound weight of &s;tandard &s;ilver to the mint, you get back &s;ixty-two &s;hillings, containing a pound weight of the like &s;tandard &s;ilver. In France, a duty of eight per cent. is deducted for the coinage, which not only defrays the ex|pence of it, but affords a &s;mall revenue to the government. In England, as the coinage co&s;ts nothing, the current coin can never be much more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it actually contains. In France, the workman&s;hip as you pay for it, adds to the value, in the &s;ame manner as to that of wrought plate. A &s;um of French money, therefore, containing a certain weight of pure &s;ilver, is more valuable than a Sum of Engli&s;h money contain|ing an equal weight of pure &s;ilver, and mu&s;t require more bullion, or other commodities to purcha&s;e it. Though the current coin of the two countries, therefore, were equally near the &s;tandards of their re&s;pective mints, a &s;um of Engli&s;h money could not well pur|cha&s;e a &s;um of French money, containing an equal number of ounces of pure &s;ilver, nor con&s;equently a bill upon France for &s;uch a &s;um. If for &s;uch a bill no more additional money was paid than what was &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the expence of the French coin|age, the real exchange might be at par between the two countries, their debts and credits might mutually compen&s;ate one another, while the computed exchange was con&s;iderably in favour of France.
<PB N="62" REF="65">
If le&s;s than this was paid, the real exchange might be in favour of England, while the computed was in favour of France.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, in &s;ome places, as at Am&s;terdam, Ham|burgh, Venice, &amp;c. foreign bills of exchange are paid in what they call bank money; while in others, as at London, Li&s;bon, Antwerp, Leghorn, &amp;c. they are paid in the common currency of the coun|try. What is called bank money is always of more value than the &s;ame nominal &s;um of common currency. A thou&s;and guilders in the bank of Am&s;terdam, for example, are of more value than a thou&s;and guilders of Am&s;terdam currency. The difference between them is called the agio of the bank, which, at Am&s;terdam, is gene|rally about five per cent. Suppo&s;ing the current money of two countries equally near to the &s;tandard of their re&s;pective mints, and that the one pays foreign bills in this common currency, while the other pays them in bank money, it is evident that the computed ex|change may be in favour of that which pays in bank money, though the real exchange &s;hould be in favour of that which pays in cur|rent money; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the computed exchange may be in favour of that which pays in better money, or in money nearer to its own &s;tandard, though the real exchange &s;hould be in favour of that which pays in wor&s;e. The computed exchange, before the late reformation of the gold coin, was generally again&s;t London with Am&s;terdam, Hamburgh, Venice, and, I believe, with all other places which pay in what is called bank money. It will by no means follow, however, that the real exchange was again&s;t it. Since the reformation of the gold coin, it has been in favour of London even with tho&s;e places. The computed exchange has gene|rally been in favour of London with Li&s;bon, Antwerp, Leghorn, and, if you except France, I believe, with mo&s;t other parts of Europe that pay in common currency; and it is not improbable that the real exchange was &s;o too.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Digre&s;&s;ion concerning Banks of Depo&s;it, particularly concerning that of</HI> Am&s;terdam.</HEAD>
<P>THE currency of a great &s;tate, &s;uch as France or England, generally con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of its own coin. Should this currency, therefore, be at any time worn, elipt, or otherwi&s;e degraded below its &s;tandard value, the &s;tate by a reformation of its coin can effectually re-e&s;tabli&s;h its currency. But the currency of a &s;mall &s;tate, &s;uch as Genoa or Hamburgh, can &s;eldom con&s;i&s;t altogether in its own coin, but mu&s;t be made up, in a great mea|&s;ure, of the coins of all the neighbouring &s;tates with which its in|habitants have a continual intercour&s;e. Such a &s;tate, therefore, by reforming its coin, will not always be able to reform its currency. If foreign bills of exchange are paid in this currency, the uncertain value of any &s;um, of what is in its own nature &s;o uncertain, mu&s;t render the exchange always very much again&s;t &s;uch a &s;tate, its cur|rency being, in all foreign &s;tates, nece&s;&s;arily valued even below what it is worth.</P>
<P>IN order to remedy the inconvenience to which this di&s;advanta|geous exchange mu&s;t have &s;ubjected their merchants, &s;uch &s;mall &s;tates, when they began to attend to the intere&s;t of trade, have frequently enacted, that foreign bills of exchange of a certain value &s;hould be paid, not in common currency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in the books of a certain bank, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the credit, and under the protection of the &s;tate; this bank being al|ways obliged to pay, in good and true money, exactly according to the &s;tandard of the &s;tate. The banks of Venice, Genoa, Am&s;ter|dam, Hamburgh, and Nuremberg, &s;eem to have been all originally e&s;tabli&s;hed with this view, though &s;ome of them may have after|wards
<PB N="64" REF="67">
been made &s;ub&s;ervient to other purpo&s;es. The money of &s;uch banks being better than the common currency of the coun|try, nece&s;&s;arily bore an agio, which was greater or &s;maller, accord|ing as the currency was &s;uppo&s;ed to be more or le&s;s degraded below the &s;tandard of the &s;tate. The agio of the bank of Hamburgh, for example, which is &s;aid to be commonly about fourteen per cent, is the &s;uppo&s;ed difference between the good &s;tandard money of the &s;tate and the clipt, worn, and dimini&s;hed currency poured into it from all the neighbouring &s;tates.</P>
<P>BEFORE 1609 the great quantity of clipt and worn foreign coin, which the exten&s;ive trade of Am&s;terdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced the value of its currency about nine per cent. below that of good money fre&s;h from the mint. Such money no &s;ooner appeared than it was melted down or carried away, as it al|ways is in &s;uch circum&s;tances. The merchants, with plenty of currency, could not always find a &s;ufficient quantity of good money to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of tho&s;e bills, in &s;pite of &s;everal regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a great mea&s;ure uncertain.</P>
<P>IN order to remedy the&s;e inconveniencies, a bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1609 under the guarantee of the city. This bank received both foreign coin, and the light and worn coin of the country at its real intrin&s;ic value in the good &s;tandard money of the country, deduct|ing only &s;o much as was nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expence of coinage, and the other nece&s;&s;ary expence of management. For the value which remained after this &s;mall deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called bank money, which, as it repre&s;ented money exactly according to the &s;tandard of the mint, was always of the &s;ame real value, and intrin&s;ically worth more than current money. It was at the &s;ame time enacted, that
<PB N="65" REF="68">
all bills drawn upon or negociated at Am&s;terdam of the value of fix hundred gilders and upwards &s;hould be paid in bank money, which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of tho&s;e bills. Every merchant, in con&s;equence of this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank in order to pay his fo|reign bills of exchange, which nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned a certain de|mand for bank money.</P>
<P>BANK money, over and above both its intrin&s;ic &s;uperiority to currency, and the additional value which this demand nece&s;&s;arily gives it, has likewi&s;e &s;ome other advantages. It is &s;ecure from fire, robbery, and other accidents; the city of Am&s;terdam is bound for it; it can be paid away by a &s;imple transfer, without the trouble of counting, or the ri&s;k of tran&s;porting it from one place to another. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e different advantages, it &s;eems from the beginning to have borne an agio, and it is ge|nerally believed that all the money originally depo&s;ited in the bank was allowed to remain there, nobody caring to demand pay|ment of a debt which he could &s;ell for a premium in the market. By demanding payment of the bank, the owner of a bank credit would lo&s;e this premium. As a &s;hilling fre&s;h from the mint will buy no more goods in the market than one of our common worn &s;hillings, &s;o the good and true money which might be brought from the coffers of the bank into tho&s;e of a private per&s;on, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the country, would be of no more value than that currency, from which it could no longer be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed. While it remained in the coffers of the bank, its &s;uperiority was known and a&s;certained. When it had come into tho&s;e of a private per&s;on, its &s;uperiority could not well be a&s;certained without more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth. By being brought from the coffers of the bank, be&s;ides, it lo&s;t all the other advantages of bank money;
<PB N="66" REF="69">
its &s;ecurity, its ea&s;y and &s;afe transferability, its u&s;e in paying fo|reign bills of exchange. Over and above all this, it could not be brought from tho&s;e coffers, as it will appear by and by, without previou&s;ly paying for the keeping.</P>
<P>THOSE depo&s;its of coin, or which the bank was bound to re|&s;tore in coin, con&s;tituted the original capital of the bank, or the whole value of what was repre&s;ented by what is called bank mo|ney. At pre&s;ent they are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute but a very &s;mall part of it. In order to facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for the&s;e many years in the practice of giving credit in its books upon depo&s;its of gold and &s;ilver bullion. This credit is generally about five per cent. below the mint price of &s;uch bullion. The bank grants at the &s;ame time what is called a recipice or re|ceipt, intitling the per&s;on who makes the depo&s;it, or the bearer, to take out the bullion again at any time within &s;ix months, upon re-transferring to the bank a quantity of bank money equal to that for which credit had been given in its books when the depo&s;it was made, and upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the keeping, if the depo&s;it was in &s;ilver; and one-half per cent. if it was in gold; but at the &s;ame time declaring, that in default of &s;uch pay|ment, and upon the expiration of this term, the depo&s;it &s;hould belong to the bank at the price at which it had been received, or for which credit had been given in the transfer books. What is thus paid for the keeping of the depo&s;it may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of warehou&s;e rent; and why this warehou&s;e rent &s;hould be &s;o much dearer for gold than for &s;ilver, &s;everal different rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned. The finene&s;s of gold, it has been &s;aid, is more difficult to be a&s;certained than that of &s;ilver. Frauds are more ea&s;ily practi&s;ed, and occa&s;ion a greater lo&s;s in the more precious metal. Silver, be&s;ides, being the &s;tandard metal, the &s;tate, it has been
<PB N="67" REF="70">
&s;aid, wi&s;hes to encourage more the making of depo&s;its of &s;ilver than of tho&s;e of gold.</P>
<P>DEPOSITS of bullion are mo&s;t commonly made when the price is &s;omewhat lower than ordinary; and they are taken out again when it happens to ri&s;e. In Holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it was &s;o in England before the late reformation of the gold coin. The difference is &s;aid to be commonly from about &s;ix to &s;ixteen &s;tivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of &s;ilver of eleven parts fine, and one part alloy. The bank price, or the credit which the bank gives for depo&s;its of &s;uch &s;ilver (when made in foreign coin, of which the finene&s;s is well known and a&s;certained, &s;uch as Mexico dollars) is twenty-two gilders, the mark; the mint price is about twenty-three gilders; and the market price is from twenty-three gilders &s;ix, to twenty-three gilders &s;ixteen &s;tivers, or from two to three per cent. above the mintprice. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are the prices at which the bank of Am&s;terdam at pre&s;ent (Sep|tember, 1775) receives bullion and coin of different kinds.</P>

<P>Bar or ingot gold is received in proportion to its finene&s;s compared with the above foreign gold coin. Upon fine bars the bank gives 340 per mark. In general, how|ever, &s;omething more is given upon coin of a known finene&s;s, than upon gold and &s;ilver bars, of which the finene&s;s cannot be a&s;certained but by a proce&s;s of melt|ing and a&s;&s;aying.</P></NOTE> The Proportions between the bank price, the mint price, and the market price of gold bullion, arenearly the&s;ame. A per&s;on can generally &s;ell his receipt for the difference between the mint price of bullion and the market price. A receipt for bullion is almo&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="71">
always worth &s;omething, and it very &s;eldom happens, therefore, that any body &s;uffers his receipt to expire, or allows his bullion to fall to the bank at the price at which it had been received, either by not taking it out before the end of the &s;ix months, or by neg|lecting to pay the one-fourth or one-half per cent. in order to ob|tain a new receipt for another &s;ix months. This, however, though it happens &s;eldom, is &s;aid to happen &s;ometimes, and more frequently with regard to gold than with regard to &s;ilver, on ac|count of the higher warehou&s;e-rent which is paid for the keeping of the more precious metal.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on who by making a depo&s;it of bullion obtains both a bank credit and a receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they be|come due with his bank credit; and either &s;ells or keeps his re|ceipt according as he judges that the price of bullion is likely to ri&s;e or to fall. The receipt and the bank credit &s;eldom keep long together, and there is no occa&s;ion that they &s;hould. The per&s;on who has a receipt, and who wants to take out bullion, finds al|ways plenty of bank credits, or bank money to buy at the ordi|nary price; and the per&s;on who has bank money, and wants to take out bullion, finds receipts always in equal abundance.</P>
<P>THE owners of bank credits and the holders of receipts con|&s;titute two different &s;orts of creditors again&s;t the bank. The holder of a receipt cannot draw out the bullion for which it is
<PB N="69" REF="72">
granted, without re-a&s;&s;igning to the bank a &s;um of bank money equal to the price at which the bullion had been received. If he has no bank money of his own, he mu&s;t purcha&s;e it of tho&s;e who have it. The owner of bank money cannot draw out bul|lion without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants. If he has none of his own, he mu&s;t buy them of tho&s;e who have them. The holder of a receipt, when he purcha&s;es bank money, purcha&s;es the power of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the mint price is five per cent. above the bank price. The agio of five per cent. therefore, which he commonly pays for it, is paid, not for an imaginary, but for a real value. The owner of bank money, when he pur|cha&s;es a receipt, purcha&s;es the power of taking out a quantity of bullion of which the market price is commonly from two to three per cent. above the mint price. The price which he pays for it, therefore, is paid likewi&s;e for a real value. The price of the receipt, and the price of the bank money, compound or make up between them the full value or price of the bullion.</P>
<P>UPON depo&s;its of the coin current in the country, the bank grants receipts likewi&s;e as well as bank credits; but tho&s;e re|ceipts are frequently of no value, and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for example, which in the currency pa&s;s for three gilders three &s;tivers each, the bank gives a credit of three gilders only, or five per cent. below their current value. It grants a receipt likewi&s;e intitling the bearer to take out the num|ber of ducatoons depo&s;ited at any time within &s;ix months, upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the keeping. This receipt will frequently bring no price in the market. Three gilders bank mo|ney generally &s;ell in the market for three gilders three &s;tivers, the full value of the decatoons if they were taken out of the bank; and before they can be taken out, one-fourth per cent. mu&s;t be
<PB N="70" REF="73">
paid for the keeping, which would be mere lo&s;s to the holder of the receipt. If the agio of the bank, however, &s;hould at any time fall to three per cent. &s;uch receipts might bring &s;ome price in the market, and might &s;ell for one and three-fourths per cent. But the agio of the bank being now generally about five per cent. &s;uch receipts are frequently allowed to expire, or as they expre&s;s it, to fall to the bank. The receipts which are given for depo&s;its of gold ducats fall to it yet more frequently, becau&s;e a higher ware|hou&s;e-rent, or one-half per cent. mu&s;t be paid for the keeping of them before they can be taken out again. The five per cent. which the bank gains, when depo&s;its either of coin or bullion are allowed to fall to it, may be con&s;idered as the warehou&s;e-rent for the perpetual keeping of &s;uch depo&s;its.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of bank money for which the receipts are expired mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable. It mu&s;t comprehend the whole origi|nal capital of the bank, which, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, has been allowed to remain there from the time it was fir&s;t depo&s;ited, no|body caring either to renew his receipt or to take out his depo&s;it, as, for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned, neither the one nor the other could be done without lo&s;s. But whatever may be the amount of this &s;um, the proportion which it bears to the whole ma&s;s of bank money is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very &s;mall. The bank of Am&s;terdam has for the&s;e many years pa&s;t been the great warehou&s;e of Europe for bul|lion, for which the receipts are very &s;eldom allowed to expire, or, as they expre&s;s it, to fall to the bank. The far greater part of the bank money, or of the credits upon the books of the bank, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been created, for the&s;e many years pa&s;t, by &s;uch depo&s;its which the dealers in bullion are continually both making and withdrawing.</P>
<P>NO demand can be made upon the bank but by means of a recipice or receipt. The &s;maller ma&s;s of bank money, for which the receipts are expired, is mixed and confounded with the much
<PB N="71" REF="74">
greater ma&s;s for which they are &s;till in force; &s;o that, though there may be a con&s;iderable &s;um of bank money, for which there are no receipts, there is no &s;pecific &s;um or portion of it, which may not at any time be demanded by one. The bank cannot be debtor to two per&s;ons for the &s;ame thing; and the owner of bank money who has no receipt cannot demand payment of the bank till he buys one. In ordinary and quiet times, he can find no dif|ficulty in getting one to buy at the market price, which generally corre&s;ponds with the price at which he can &s;ell the coin or bullion it in titles him to take out of the bank.</P>
<P>IT might be otherwi&s;e during a public calamity; an inva&s;ion, for example, &s;uch as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank money being then all eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it in their own keeping, the demand for receipts might rai&s;e their price to an exorbitant height. The holders of them might form extravagant expectations, and, in&s;tead of two or three per cent. demand half the bank money for which credit had been given upon the depo&s;its that the receipts had re&s;pectively been granted for. The enemy, informed of the con&s;titution of the bank, might even buy them up in order to prevent the carry|ing away of the trea&s;ure. In &s;uch emergencies, the bank, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, would break through its ordinary rule of making pay|ment only to the holders of receipts. The holders of receipts, who had no bank money, mu&s;t have received within two or three per cent. of the value of the depo&s;it for which their re&s;pective re|ceipts had been granted. The bank, therefore, it is &s;aid, would in this ca&s;e make no &s;cruple of paying, either with money or bul|lion, the full value of what the owners of bank money who could get no receipts, were credited for in its books; paying at the &s;ame time two or three per cent. to &s;uch holders of receipts as had no bank money, that being the whole value which in this &s;tate of things could ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed due to them.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75">
EVEN in ordinary and quiet times it is the intere&s;t of the holders of receipts to depre&s;s the agio, in order either to buy bank money (and con&s;equently the bullion, which their receipts would then enable them to take out of the bank) &s;o much cheaper, or to &s;ell their receipts to tho&s;e who have bank money, and who want to take out bullion, &s;o much dearer; the price of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the market price of bank money, and that of the coin or bullion for which the receipt had been granted. It is the intere&s;t of the owners of bank money, on the contrary, to rai&s;e the agio, in order either to &s;ell their bank money &s;o much dearer, or to buy a receipt &s;o much cheaper. To prevent the &s;tock jobbing tricks which tho&s;e oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts might &s;ometimes occa&s;ion, the bank has of late years come to the re&s;olution to &s;ell at all times bank money for currency, at five per cent. agio, and to buy it in again at four per cent. agio. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, the agio can never either ri&s;e above five, or &s;ink below four per cent. and the proportion between the market price of bank and that of current money, is kept at all times very near to the proportion between their intrin&s;ic values. Before this re&s;olution was taken, the market price of bank money u&s;ed &s;ometimes to ri&s;e &s;o high as nine per cent. agio, and &s;ometimes to &s;ink &s;o low as par, according as oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts happened to influence the market.</P>
<P>THE bank of Am&s;terdam profe&s;&s;es to lend out no part of what is depo&s;ited with it, but, for every gilder for which it gives credit in its books, to keep in its repo&s;itories the value of a gilder either in money or bullion. That it keeps in its repo&s;itories all the money or bullion for which there are receipts in force, for which it is at all times liable to be called upon, and which, in reality, is conti|nually going from it and returning to it again, cannot well be doubted. But whether it does &s;o likewi&s;e with regard to that part
<PB N="73" REF="76">
of its capital, for which the receipts are long ago expired, for which in ordinary and quiet times it cannot be called upon, and which in reality is very likely to remain with it for ever, or as long as the States of the United Provinces &s;ub&s;i&s;t, may perhaps appear more uncertain. At Am&s;terdam, however, no point of faith is better e&s;tabli&s;hed than that for every gilder, circulated as bank mo|ney, there is a corre&s;pondent gilder in gold or &s;ilver to be found in the trea&s;ure of the bank. The city is guarantee that it &s;hould be &s;o. The bank is under the direction of the four reigning burgo|ma&s;ters, who are changed every year. Each new &s;ett of burgo|ma&s;ters vi&s;its the trea&s;ure, compares it with the books, receives it upon oath, and delivers it over, with the &s;ame awful &s;olemnity, to the &s;ett which &s;ucceeds it; and in that &s;ober and religious country oaths are not yet di&s;regarded. A rotation of this kind &s;eems alone a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t any practices which cannot be avowed. Amid&s;t all the revolutions which faction has ever occa&s;ioned in the government of Am&s;terdam, the prevailing party has at no time accu&s;ed their predece&s;&s;ors of infidelity in the admini&s;tration of the bank. No accu&s;ation could have affected more deeply the reputa|tion and fortune of the di&s;graced party, and if &s;uch an accu&s;ation could have been &s;upported, we may be a&s;&s;ured that it would have been brought. In 1672, when the French king was at Utrecht, the bank of Am&s;terdam paid &s;o readily as left no doubt of the fide|lity with which it had ob&s;erved its engagements. Some of the pieces which were then brought from its repo&s;itories appeared to have been &s;corched with the fire which happened in the town-hou&s;e &s;oon after the bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Tho&s;e pieces, therefore, mu&s;t have lain there from that time.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the amount of the trea&s;ure in the bank is a que&s;|tion which has long employed the &s;peculations of the curious. No|thing but conjecture can be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned that there are about two thou&s;and people who keep
<PB N="74" REF="77">
accounts with the bank, and allowing them to have, one with ano|ther, the value of fifteen hundred pounds &s;terling lying upon their re&s;pective accounts, (a very large allowance) the whole quantity of bank money, and con&s;equently of trea&s;ure in the bank, will amount to about three millions &s;terling, or, at eleven gilders the pound &s;ter|ling, thirty-three millions of gilders; a great &s;um, and &s;ufficient to carry on a very exten&s;ive circulation, but va&s;tly below the extra|vagant ideas which &s;ome people have formed of this trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE city of Am&s;terdam derives a con&s;iderable revenue from the bank. Be&s;ides what may be called the warehou&s;e-rent above-men|tioned, each per&s;on, upon fir&s;t opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of ten gilders; and for every new account three gilders three &s;tivers; for every transfer two &s;tivers; and if the transfer is for le&s;s than three hundred gilders, &s;ix &s;tivers, in order to di&s;cou|rage the multiplicity of &s;mall tran&s;actions. The per&s;on who neg|lects to balance his account twice in the year forfeits twenty-five gilders. The per&s;on who orders a transfer for more than is upon his account, is obliged to pay three per cent. for the &s;um over|drawn, and his order is &s;et a&s;ide into the bargain. The bank is &s;uppo&s;ed too to make a con&s;iderable profit by the &s;ale of the foreign coin or bullion which &s;ometimes falls to it by the expiring of re|ceipts, and which is always kept till it can be &s;old with advantage. It makes a profit likewi&s;e by &s;elling bank money at five per cent. agio, and buying it in at four. The&s;e different emoluments amount to a good deal more than what is nece&s;&s;ary for paying the &s;alaries of officers, and defraying the expence of management. What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon receipts, is alone &s;up|po&s;ed to amount to a neat annual revenue of between one hundred and fifty thou&s;and and two hundred thou&s;and gilders. Public utility, however, and not revenue, was the original object of this in&s;titu|tion. Its object was to relieve the merchants from the inconveni|ence of a di&s;advantageous exchange. The revenue which has ari|&s;en
<PB N="75" REF="78">
from it was unfore&s;een, and may be con&s;idered as accidental. But it is now time to return from this long digre&s;&s;ion, into which I have been in&s;en&s;ibly led in endeavouring to explain the rea&s;ons why the exchange between the countries which pay in what is called bank money, and tho&s;e which pay in common currency, &s;hould generally appear to be in favour of the former, and again&s;t the latter. The former pay in a &s;pecies of money of which the intrin|&s;ic value is always the &s;ame, and exactly agreeable to the &s;tandard of their re&s;pective mints; the latter in a &s;pecies of money of which the intrin&s;ic value is continually varying, and is almo&s;t always more or le&s;s below that &s;tandard. But though the computed exchange mu&s;t generally be in favour of the former, the real exchange may frequently be in favour of the latter.</P>

<P>THOUGH the computed exchange between any two places were in every re&s;pect the &s;ame with the real, it would not always fol|low that what is called the balance of trade was in favour of that place which had the ordinary cour&s;e of exchange in its favour. The ordinary cour&s;e of exchange might, indeed, in this ca&s;e, be a tolerable indication of the ordinary &s;tate of debt and credit between them, and &s;how which of the two countries u&s;ually had occa&s;ion to &s;end out money to the other. But the ordinary &s;tate of debt and credit between any two places is not always entirely regu|lated by the ordinary cour&s;e of their dealings with one another, but is influenced by that of the dealings of both with many other countries. If it was u&s;ual, for example, for the merchants of England to pay the goods which they buy from Hamburgh, Dant|zick, Riga, &amp;c. by bills upon Holland, the ordinary &s;tate of debt and credit between England and Holland would not be entirely regulated by the ordinary cour&s;e of the dealings of tho&s;e two coun|tries with one another, but would be influenced by that of Eng|land with tho&s;e other places. England might, in this ca&s;e, be annually obliged to &s;end out money to Holland, though its annual
<PB N="76" REF="79">
exports to that country exceeded the annual value of its imports from it, and though what is called the balance of trade was very much in favour of England.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I have been endeavouring to &s;hew, even upon the principles of the commercial &s;y&s;tem, how unnece&s;ary it is to lay extraordinary re&s;traints upon the importation of goods from tho&s;e countries with which the balance of trade is &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;ad|vantageous.</P>
<P>NOTHING, however, can be more ab&s;urd than this whole doc|trine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only the&s;e re&s;traints, but almo&s;t all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this doctrine &s;uppo&s;es that, if the balance be even, neither of them either lo&s;es or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one &s;ide, that one of them lo&s;es, and the other gains in proportion to its declen&s;ion from the exact equi|librium. Both &s;uppo&s;itions are fal&s;e. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies, may be, and commonly is di&s;|advantageous to the country in who&s;e favour it is meant to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew hereafter. But that trade which, without force or con&s;traint, is naturally and regularly car|ried on between any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally &s;o, to both.</P>
<P>BY advantage or gain, I under&s;tand, not the increa&s;e of the quantity of gold and &s;ilver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, or the increa&s;e of the annual revenue of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>IF the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places con&s;i&s;t altogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, not only both gain, but they will gain equally, or very near equally: each will in this ca&s;e afford a market for a part of the &s;urplus produce of the other: each will
<PB N="77" REF="80">
replace a capital which had been employed in rai&s;ing this part of the &s;urplus produce of the other, and which had been di&s;tributed among, and given revenue and maintenance to a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part of the inhabitants of each there|fore will indirectly derive their revenue and maintenance from the other. As the commodities exchanged too are &s;uppo&s;ed to be of equal value, &s;o the two capitals employed in the trade will, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, be equal, or very nearly equal; and both being employed in rai&s;ing the native commodities of the two countries, the revenue and maintenance which their di&s;tribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will be equal, or very nearly equal. This revenue and maintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or &s;maller in proportion to the extent of their dealings. If the&s;e &s;hould annually amount to an hundred thou&s;and pounds, for example, or to a million on each &s;ide, each of them would afford an annual revenue, in the one ca&s;e, of an hundred thou&s;and pounds, in the other, of a million, to the inhabitants of the other.</P>
<P>IF their trade &s;hould be of &s;uch a nature that one of them ex|ported to the other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other con&s;i&s;ted altogether in foreign goods; the balance, in this ca&s;e, would &s;till be &s;uppo&s;ed even, commodities being paid for with commodities. They would, in this ca&s;e too, both gain, but they would not gain equally; and the inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but native commodities would derive the greate&s;t revenue from the trade. If England, for exam|ple, &s;hould import from France nothing but the native commodi|ties of that country, and, not having &s;uch commodities of its own as were in demand there, &s;hould annually repay them by &s;ending thither a large quantity of foreign goods, tobacco, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, and Ea&s;t India goods; this trade, though it would give &s;ome revenue to the inhabitants of both countries, would give
<PB N="78" REF="81">
more to tho&s;e of France than to tho&s;e of England. The whole French capital annually employed in it would annually be di&s;tri|buted among the people of France. But that part of the Engli&s;h capital only which was employed in producing the Engli&s;h commo|dities with which tho&s;e foreign goods were purcha&s;ed, would be annually di&s;tributed among the people of England. The greater part of it would replace the capitals which had been employed in Virginia, Indo&s;tan, and China, and which had given revenue and maintenance to the inhabitants of tho&s;e di&s;tant countries. If the capitals were equal, or nearly equal, therefore, this employment of the French capital would augment much more the revenue of the people of France, than that of the Engli&s;h capital would the revenue of the people of England. France would in this ca&s;e carry on a direct foreign trade of con&s;umption with England; whereas England would carry on a round-about trade of the &s;ame kind with France. The different effects of a capital employed in the direct, and of one employed in the round-about foreign trade of con&s;umption, have already been fully explained.</P>
<P>THERE is not, probably, between any two countries, a trade which con&s;i&s;ts altogether in the exchange either of native commo|dities on both &s;ides, or of native commodities on one &s;ide and of foreign goods on the other. Almo&s;t all countries exchange with one another partly native and partly foreign goods. That coun|try, however, in who&s;e cargoes there is the greate&s;t proportion of native, and the lea&s;t of foreign goods, will always be the prin|cipal gainer. If it was not with tobacco and Ea&s;t India goods, but with gold and &s;ilver, that England paid for the commodities annually imported from France, the balance, in this ca&s;e, would be &s;uppo&s;ed uneven, commodities not being paid for with commo|dities, but with gold and &s;ilver. The trade, however, would, in this ca&s;e, as in the foregoing, give &s;ome revenue to the inhabitants
<PB N="79" REF="82">
of both countries, but more to tho&s;e of France than to tho&s;e of England. It would give &s;ome revenue to tho&s;e of England. The capital which had been employed in producing the Engli&s;h goods that purcha&s;ed this gold and &s;ilver, the capital which had been di&s;tributed among, and given revenue to certain inhabitants of England, would thereby be replaced, and enabled to continue that employment. The whole capital of England would no more be dimini&s;hed by this exportation of gold and &s;ilver, than by the expor|tation of an equal value of any other goods. On the contrary, it would, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, be augmented. No goods are &s;ent abroad but tho&s;e for which the demand is &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater abroad than at home, and of which the returns con&s;equently, it is expect|ed, will be of more value at home than the commodities export|ed. If the tobacco which, in England, is worth only a hundred thou&s;and pounds, when &s;ent to France will purcha&s;e wine which is, in England, worth a hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds, the exchange will augment the capital of England by ten thou&s;and pounds. If a hundred thou&s;and pounds of Engli&s;h gold, in the &s;ame manner, purcha&s;e French wine which, in England, is worth a hundred and ten thou&s;and, this exchange will equally augment the capital of England by ten thou&s;and pounds. As a merchant who has a hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds worth of wine in his cellar, is a richer man than he who has only a hundred thou&s;and pounds worth of tobacco in his warehou&s;e, &s;o is he likewi&s;e a richer man than he who has only a hundred thou&s;and pounds worth of gold in his coffers. He can put into motion a greater quantity of indu&s;try, and give revenue, maintenance, and employ|ment, to a greater number of people than either of the other two. But the capital of the country is equal to the capitals of all its different inhabitants, and the quantity of indu&s;try which can be annually maintained in it, is equal to what all tho&s;e different capi|tals can maintain. Both the capital of the country, therefore,
<PB N="80" REF="83">
and the quantity of indu&s;try which can be annually maintained in it, mu&s;t generally be augmented by this exchange. It would, indeed, be more advantageous for England that it could purcha&s;e the wines of France with its own hardware and broad-cloth, than with either the tobacco of Virginia, or the gold and &s;ilver of Brazil and Peru. A direct foreign trade of con&s;umption is always more advantageous than a round-about one. But a round-about foreign trade of con&s;umption which is carried on with gold and &s;ilver, does not &s;eem to be le&s;s advantageous than any other equally round|about one. Neither is a country which has no mines more likely to be exhau&s;ted of gold and &s;ilver by this annual exportation of tho&s;e metals, than one which does not grow tobacco by the like annual exportation of that plant. As a country which has where|withal to buy tobacco will never be long in want of it, &s;o nei|ther will one be long in want of gold and &s;ilver which has where|withal to purcha&s;e tho&s;e metals.</P>
<P>IT is a lo&s;ing trade, it is &s;aid, which a workman carries on with the alehou&s;e; and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally carry on with a wine country, may be con&s;idered as a trade of the &s;ame nature. I an&s;wer, that the trade with the alehou&s;e is not nece&s;&s;arily a lo&s;ing trade. In its own nature it is ju&s;t as advantageous as any other, though, perhaps, &s;omewhat more liable to be abu&s;ed. The employment of a brewer, and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as nece&s;&s;ary divi&s;ions of labour as any other. It will generally be more advantageous for a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occa&s;ion for than to make it him&s;elf, and if he is a poor workman, it will ge|nerally be more advantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer, than a large quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of either, as he may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood, of the butcher, if he is a glutton, or of the draper, if he affects to be a beau among his companions. It is

advantageous to the great body of workmen notwith&s;tanding, that all the&s;e trades &s;hould be free, though this freedom may be abu&s;ed in all of them, and is more likely to be &s;o, perhaps, in &s;ome than in others. Though individuals, be&s;ides, may &s;ometimes ruin their fortunes by an exce&s;&s;ive con&s;umption of fermented liquors, there &s;eems to be no ri&s;k that a nation &s;hould do &s;o. Though in every country there are many people who &s;pend upon &s;uch liquors more than they can afford, there are always many more who &s;pend le&s;s. It de&s;erves to be remarked too that, if we con&s;ult experience, the cheapne&s;s of wine &s;eems to be a cau&s;e, not of drunkenne&s;s, but of &s;obriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are in ge|neral the &s;obere&s;t people in Europe; witne&s;s the Spaniards, the Italians, and the inhabitants of the &s;outhern provinces of France. People are &s;eldom guilty of exce&s;s in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects the character of liberality and good fellow&s;hip, by being profu&s;e of a liquor which is as cheap as &s;mall beer. On the contrary, in the countries which from either exce&s;&s;ive heat or cold produce no grapes, and where wine con&s;equently is dear and a rarity, drunkenne&s;s is a common vice, as among the northern nations, and all tho&s;e who live between the tropicks, the negroes, for example, on the coa&s;t of Guinea. When a French regiment comes from &s;ome of the northern provinces of France, where wine is &s;omewhat dear, to be quartered in the &s;outhern, where it is very cheap, the &s;oldiers. I have frequently heard it ob&s;erved, are at fir&s;t debauched by the cheapne&s;s and novelty of good wine; but after a few months re&s;idence, the greater part of them become as &s;ober as the re&s;t of the inhabitants. Were the duties upon foreign wines, and the exci&s;es upon malt, beer, and ale, to be taken away all at once, it might, in the &s;ame manner, occa&s;ion in Great Britain a pretty general and temporary drunkenne&s;s among the middling and inferior ranks of people, which would probably be &s;oon followed by a permanent and almo&s;t univer&s;al
<PB N="82" REF="85">
&s;obriety. At pre&s;ent drunkenne&s;s is by no means the vice of peo|ple of fa&s;hion, or of tho&s;e who can ea&s;ily afford the mo&s;t expen|&s;ive liquors. A gentleman drunk with ale, has &s;carce ever been &s;een among us. The re&s;traints upon the wine trade in Great Britain be&s;ides, do not &s;o much &s;eem calculated to hinder the people from going, if I may &s;ay &s;o, to the alehou&s;e, as from going where they can buy the be&s;t and cheape&s;t liquor. They favour the wine trade of Portugal, and di&s;courage that of France. The Portugue&s;e, it is &s;aid, indeed, are better cu&s;tomers for our manufactures than the French, and &s;hould therefore be encou|raged in preference to them. As they give us their cu&s;tom, it is pretended, we &s;hould give them our's. The &s;neaking arts of un|derling trade&s;men are thus erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great empire: for it is the mo&s;t underling trade&s;men only who make it a rule to employ chiefly their own cu&s;tomers. A great trader purcha&s;es his goods always where they are cheape&s;t and be&s;t, without regard to any little intere&s;t of this kind.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch maxims as the&s;e, however, nations have been taught that their intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the pro&s;perity of all the nations with which it trades, and to con|&s;ider their gain as its own lo&s;s. Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friend&s;hip, has become the mo&s;t fertile &s;ource of di&s;cord and animo&s;ity. The capricious ambition of kings and mini&s;ters has not, during the pre&s;ent and the preceeding century, been more fatal to the repo&s;e of Europe than the impertinent jealou&s;y of merchants and manufacturers. The violence and inju&s;tice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil, for which, I am afraid the nature of human affairs can &s;carce admit of a remedy. But the mean rapacity, the monopolizing &s;pirit of merchants and manu|facturers,
<PB N="83" REF="86">
who neither are, nor ought to be the rulers of man|kind, though it cannot perhaps be corrected, may very ea&s;ily be prevented from di&s;turbing the tranquillity of any body but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THAT it was the &s;pirit of monopoly which originally both in|vented and propagated this doctrine, cannot be doubted; and they who fir&s;t taught it were by no means &s;uch fools as they who be|lieved it. In every country it always is and mu&s;t be the intere&s;t of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of tho&s;e who &s;ell it cheape&s;t. The propo&s;ition is &s;o very manife&s;t, that it &s;eems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it; nor could it ever have been called in que&s;tion had not the intere&s;ted &s;ophi&s;try of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. Their intere&s;t is, in this directly oppo&s;ite to that of the great body of the people. As it is intere&s;t of the freemen of a corporation to hinder the re&s;t of the inhabitants from employing any workmen but them&s;elves, &s;o it is the intere&s;t of the merchants and manufacturers of every country to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the monopoly of the home market. Hence in Great Britain and in mo&s;t other European countries the extraordi|nary duties upon almo&s;t all goods imported by alien merchants. Hence the high duties and prohibitions upon all tho&s;e foreign manufactures which can come into competition with our own. Hence too the extraordinary re&s;traints upon the importation of almo&s;t all &s;orts of goods from tho&s;e countries with which the ba|lance of trade is &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;advantageous; that is, from tho&s;e again&s;t whom national animo&s;ity happens to be mo&s;t vio|lently inflamed.</P>
<P>THE wealth of a neighbouring nation, however, though danger|ous in war and politicks, is certainly advantageous in trade. In a
<PB N="84" REF="87">
&s;tate of ho&s;tility it may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies &s;uperior to our own; but in a &s;tate of peace and commerce it mu&s;t likewi&s;e enable them to exchange with us to a greater value, and to afford a better market, either for the immediate produce of our own indu&s;try, or for whatever is purcha&s;ed with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better cu&s;tomer to the indu&s;trious people in his neighbourhood, than a poor, &s;o is likewi&s;e a rich nation. A rich man, indeed, who is him&s;elf a manufacturer, is a very dangerous neighbour to all tho&s;e who deal in the &s;ame way. All the re&s;t of the neighbourhood, however, by far the greate&s;t number, profit by the good market which his ex|pence affords them. They even profit by his under&s;elling the poorer workmen who deal in the &s;ame way with him. The ma|nufacturers of a rich nation, in the &s;ame manner, may no doubt be very dangerous rivals to tho&s;e of their neighbours. This very competition, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people, who profit greatly be&s;ides by the good market which the great expence of &s;uch a nation affords them in every other way. Private people who want to make a fortune, never think of retir|ing to the remote and poor provinces of the country, but re&s;ort either to the capital or to &s;ome of the great commercial towns. They know, that where little wealth circulates there is little to be got, but that where a great deal is in motion, &s;ome &s;hare of it may fall to them. The &s;ame maxims which would in this man|ner direct the common &s;en&s;e of one, or ten, or twenty indivi|duals, &s;hould regulate the judgement of one, or ten, or twenty millions, and &s;hould make a whole nation regard the riches of its neighbours, as a probable cau&s;e and occa&s;ion for it&s;elf to acquire riches. A nation that would enrich it&s;elf by foreign trade is certainly mo&s;t likely to do &s;o when its neighbours are all rich, indu&s;trious, and commercial nations. A great nation &s;urrounded
<PB N="85" REF="88">
on all &s;ides by wandering &s;avages and poor barbarians might, no doubt, acquire riches by the cultivation of its own lands, and by its own interior commerce, but not by foreign trade. It &s;eems to have been in this manner that the ancient Egyptians and the modern Chine&s;e acquired their great wealth. The ancient Egyp|tians, it is &s;aid, neglected foreign commerce, and the modern Chine&s;e, it is known, hold it in the utmo&s;t contempt, and &s;carce deign to afford it the decent protection of the laws. The modern maxims of foreign commerce, by aiming at the impoveri&s;hment of all our neighbours, &s;o far as they are capable of producing their intended effect, tend to render that very commerce in&s;igni|ficant and contemptible.</P>
<P>THERE is no commercial country in Europe of which the approaching ruin has not frequently been foretold by the pre|tended doctors of this &s;y&s;tem, from an unfavourable balance of trade. After all the anxiety however which they have excited about this, after all the vain attempts of almo&s;t all trading nations to turn that balance in their own favour and again&s;t their neigh|bours, it does not appear that any one nation in Europe has been in any re&s;pect impoveri&s;hed by this cau&s;e. Every town and coun|try, on the contrary, in proportion as they have opened their ports to all nations; in&s;tead of being ruined by this free trade, as the principles of the commercial &s;y&s;tem would lead us to ex|pect, have been enriched by it. Though there are in Europe, indeed, a few towns which in &s;ome re&s;pects de&s;erve the name of free ports, there is no country which does &s;o. Holland, perhaps, approaches the neare&s;t to this character of any, though &s;till very remote from it; and Holland, it is acknowledged, not only derives its whole wealth, but a great part of its nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, from foreign trade.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89">
THERE is another balance indeed, which has already been ex|plained, very different from the balance of trade, and which, according as it happens to be either favourable or unfavourable, nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions the pro&s;perity or decay of every nation. This is the balance of the annual produce and con&s;umption. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, it has already been ob&s;erved, exceeds that of the annual con&s;umption, the capital of the &s;ociety mu&s;t annually increa&s;e in proportion to this exce&s;s. The &s;ociety in this ca&s;e lives within its revenue, and what is annually &s;aved out of its revenue, is naturally added to its capi|tal, and employed &s;o as to increa&s;e &s;till further the annual pro|duce. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, on the contrary, fall &s;hort of the annual con&s;umption, the capital of the &s;ociety mu&s;t annually decay in proportion to this deficiency. The expence of the &s;ociety in this ca&s;e exceeds its revenue, and nece&s;&s;arily encroaches upon its capital. Its capital, therefore, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily decay, and together with it, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THIS balance of produce and con&s;umption is entirely different from, what is called, the balance of trade. It might take place in a nation which had no foreign trade, but which was entirely &s;eparated from all the world. It may take place in the whole globe of the earth, of which the wealth, population, and improve|ment may be either gradually increa&s;ing or gradually decaying.</P>
<P>THE balance of produce and con&s;umption may be con&s;tantly in favour of a nation, though what is called the balance of trade be generally again&s;t it. A nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a century, perhaps, together; the gold and &s;ilver which comes into it during all this time may be all im|mediately &s;ent out of it; its circulating coin may gradually decay,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
different &s;orts of paper money being &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, and even the debts too which it contracts in the principal nations with whom it deals may be gradually increa&s;ing; and yet its real wealth, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and labour may, during the &s;ame period, have been increa&s;ing in a much greater proportion. The &s;tate of our North American colonies, and the trade which they carried on with Great Britain, before the commencement of the late di&s;turbances, may &s;erve as a proof that this is by no means an impo&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of Drawbacks.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MERCHANTS and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of the home market, but de&s;ire likewi&s;e the mo&s;t exten&s;ive foreign &s;ale for their goods. Their country has no juri&s;diction in foreign nations, and therefore can &s;eldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally obliged therefore to content them&s;elves with petitioning for certain encouragements to exportation.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e encouragements what are called Drawbacks &s;eem to be the mo&s;t rea&s;onable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation, either the whole or a part of whatever exci&s;e or in|land duty is impo&s;ed upon dome&s;tick indu&s;try, can never occa&s;ion the exportation of a greater quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been impo&s;ed. Such encourage|ments do not tend to turn towards any particular employment a greater &s;hare of the capital of the country, than what would go
<PB N="88" REF="91">
to it of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty from driving away any part of that &s;hare to other employments. They tend not to overturn that balance which naturally e&s;tabli&s;hes it&s;elf among all the various employments of the &s;ociety; but to hinder it from being overturned by the duty. They tend not to de&s;troy but to pre&s;erve, what it is in mo&s;t ca&s;es advantageous to pre|&s;erve, the natural divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of labour in the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the drawacks upon the re-expor|tation of foreign goods imported; which in Great Britain generally amount to by much the large&s;t part of the duty upon importation. Half the duties impo&s;ed by what is called the old &s;ub&s;idy, are drawn back univer&s;ally, except upon goods exported to the Briti&s;h plan|tations; and frequently the whole, almo&s;t always a part of tho&s;e impo&s;ed by later &s;ub&s;idies and impo&s;ts. Drawbacks were, per|haps, originally granted for the encouragement of the carrying trade, which, as the freight of the &s;hips is frequently paid by fo|reigners in money, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be peculiarly fitted for bring|ing gold and &s;ilver into the country. But though the carrying trade certainly de&s;erves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the in&s;titution was, perhaps, abundantly fooli&s;h, the in&s;titution it&s;elf &s;eems rea&s;onable enough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater &s;hare of the capital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own accord, had there been no duties upon importation. They only prevent its being excluded altogether by tho&s;e duties. The carrying trade, though it de&s;erves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but to be left free like all other trades. It is a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ource for tho&s;e capitals which cannot find employment either in the agriculture or in the manufactures of the country, either in its home trade or in its foreign trade of con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">
THE revenue of the cu&s;toms, in&s;tead of &s;uffering, profits from &s;uch drawbacks, by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole duties had been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid, could &s;eldom have been exported, nor con&s;equently imported, for want of a market. The duties, therefore, of which a part is retained, would never have been paid.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons &s;eem &s;ufficiently to ju&s;tify drawbacks, and would ju&s;tify them, though the whole duties, whether upon the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, or upon foreign goods, were always drawn back upon exportation. The revenue of exci&s;e would in this ca&s;e, indeed, &s;uffer a little, and that of the cu&s;toms a good deal more; but the natural balance of indu&s;try, the natural divi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of labour, which is always more or le&s;s di&s;turbed by &s;uch duties, would be more nearly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;uch a regulation.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons, however, will ju&s;tify drawbacks only upon ex|porting goods to tho&s;e countries which are altogether foreign and independent, not to tho&s;e in which our merchants and manu|facturers enjoy a monopoly. A drawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods to our American colonies, will not always occa&s;ion a greater exportation than what would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the &s;ame quantity might frequently, perhaps, be &s;ent thither, though the whole duties were retained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure lo&s;s to the revenue of exci&s;e and cu&s;toms, without altering the &s;tate of the trade, or rendering it in any re&s;pect more exten|&s;ive. How far &s;uch drawbacks can be ju&s;tified, as a proper en|couragement to the indu&s;try of our colonies, or how far it is
<PB N="90" REF="93">
advantageous to the mother country, that they &s;hould be exempted from taxes which are paid by all the re&s;t of their fellow &s;ubjects, will appear hereafter when I come to treat of colonies.</P>
<P>DRAWBACKS however, it mu&s;t always be under&s;tood, are u&s;eful only in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the goods for the exportation of which they are given, are really exported to &s;ome foreign country; and not clande&s;tinely reimported into our own. That &s;ome drawbacks, particularly tho&s;e upon tobacco, have frequently been abu&s;ed in this manner, and have given occa&s;ion to many frauds equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader, is well known.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of Bounties.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BOUNTIES upon exportation are, in Great Britain, fre|quently petitioned for, and &s;ometimes granted to the produce of particular branches of dome&s;tick indu&s;try. By means of them our merchants and manufacturers, it is pretended, will be enabled to &s;ell their goods as cheap or cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is &s;aid, will thus be export|ed, and the balance of trade con&s;equently turned more in favour of our own country. We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the foreign, as we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to buy their goods, as we have done our own coun|trymen. The next be&s;t expedient, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this manner that the mercan|tile &s;y&s;tem propo&s;es to enrich the whole country, and to put money into all our pockets by means of the balance of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="94">
BOUNTIES, it is allowed, ought to be given to tho&s;e branches of trade only which cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade in which the merchant can &s;ell his goods for a price which replaces to him, with the ordinary profits of &s;tock, the whole capital employed in preparing and &s;ending them to mar|ket, can be carried on without a bounty. Every &s;uch branch is evidently upon a level with all the other branches of trade which are carried on without bounties, and cannot therefore require one more than they. Tho&s;e trades only require bounties in which the merchant is obliged to &s;ell his goods for a price which does not replace to him his capital, together with the ordinary profit; or in which he is obliged to &s;ell them for le&s;s than it really co&s;ts him to &s;end them to market. The bounty is given in order to make up this lo&s;s, and to encourage him to continue, or perhaps to be|gin, a trade of which the expence is &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater than the returns, of which every operation eats up a part of the capi|tal employed in it, and which is of &s;uch a nature, that, if all other trades re&s;embled it, there would &s;oon be no capital left in the country.</P>
<P>THE trades, it is to be ob&s;erved, which are carried on by means of bounties, are the only ones which can be carried on between two nations for any con&s;iderable time together, in &s;uch a manner as that one of them &s;hall always and regularly lo&s;e, or &s;ell its goods for le&s;s than it really co&s;ts to &s;end them to market. But if the bounty did not repay to the merchant what he would otherwi&s;e lo&s;e upon the price of his goods, his own intere&s;t would &s;oon oblige him to employ his &s;tock in another way, or to find out a trade in which the price of the goods would replace to him, with the ordi|nary profit, the capital employed in &s;ending them to market. The effect of bounties, like that of all the other expedients of the mer|cantile &s;y&s;tem, can only be to force the trade of a country into a
<PB N="92" REF="95">
channel much le&s;s advantageous than that in which it would natu|rally run of its own accord.</P>
<P>THE ingenious and well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade has &s;hown very clearly, that &s;ince the bounty upon the exportation of corn was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, the price of the corn exported, valued moderately enough, has exceeded that of the corn imported, valued very high, by a much greater &s;um than the amount of the whole bounties which have been paid during that period. This, he imagines, upon the true principles of the mer|cantile &s;y&s;tem, is a clear proof that this forced corn trade is bene|ficial to the nation; the value of the exportation exceeding that of the importation by a much greater &s;um than the whole extraor|dinary expence which the publick has been at in order to get it exported. He does not con&s;ider that this extraordinary expence, or the bounty, is the &s;malle&s;t part of the expence which the exporta|tion of corn really co&s;ts the &s;ociety. The capital which the far|mer employed in rai&s;ing it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken into the account. Unle&s;s the price of the corn when &s;old in the foreign markets re|places, not only the bounty, but this capital, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock, the &s;ociety is a lo&s;er by the difference, or the national &s;tock is &s;o much dimini&s;hed. But the very rea&s;on for which it has been thought nece&s;&s;ary to grant a bounty is the &s;up|po&s;ed in&s;ufficiency of the price to do this.</P>
<P>THE average price of corn, it has been &s;aid, has fallen con&s;ider|ably &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bounty. That the average price of corn began to fall &s;omewhat towards the end of the la&s;t cen|tury, and has continued to do &s;o during the cour&s;e of the &s;ixty-four fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent, I have already endeavoured to &s;how. But this event, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be as real as I believe it to be, mu&s;t have happened in &s;pite of the bounty, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly have happened in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="96">
IN years of plenty, it has already been ob&s;erved, the bounty, by occa&s;ioning an extraordinary exportation, nece&s;&s;arily keeps up the price of corn in the home market above what it would naturally fall to. To do &s;o was the avowed purpo&s;e of the in&s;titution. In years of &s;carcity, though the bounty is frequently &s;u&s;pended, yet the great exportation which it occa&s;ions in years of plenty, mu&s;t frequently hinder more or le&s;s the plenty of one year from relieving the &s;carcity of another. Both in years of plenty, and in years of &s;carcity, therefore, the bounty nece&s;&s;arily tends to rai&s;e the money price of corn &s;omewhat higher than it otherwi&s;e would be in the home market.</P>
<P>THAT, in the actual &s;tate of tillage, the bounty mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have this tendency, will not, I apprehend, be di&s;puted by any rea|&s;onable per&s;on. But it has been thought by many people, that by &s;ecuring to the farmer a better price than he could otherwi&s;e expect in the actual &s;tate of tillage, it tends to encourage tillage; and that the con&s;equent increa&s;e of corn may, in a long period of years, lower its price more than the bounty can rai&s;e it in the actual &s;tate which tillage may, at the end of that period, happen to be in.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that this might be the ca&s;e if the effect of the bounty was to rai&s;e the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer with an equal quantity of it to maintain a greater number of labourers in the &s;ame manner, whether liberal, moderate, or &s;canty, that other labourers are commonly maintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is evident, nor any other human in&s;titution, can have any &s;uch effect. It is not the real, but the nominal price of corn only, which can be at all affected by the bounty.</P>
<P>THE real effect of the bounty is not &s;o much to rai&s;e the real value of corn, as to degrade the real value of &s;ilver; or to make an equal quantity of it exchange for a &s;maller quantity, not only of
<PB N="94" REF="97">
corn, but of all other commodities: for the money price of corn regulates that of all other commodities.</P>
<P>IT regulates the money price of labour, which mu&s;t always be &s;uch as to enable the labourer to purcha&s;e a quantity of corn &s;uf|ficient to maintain him and his family either in the liberal, mode|rate, or &s;canty manner in which the advancing, &s;tationary, or de|clining circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety oblige his employers to main|tain him.</P>
<P>IT regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of land, which, in every period of improvement, mu&s;t bear a certain proportion to that of corn, though this proportion is different in different periods. It regulates, for example, the money price of gra&s;s and hay, of butcher's meat, of hor&s;es, and the maintenance of hor&s;es, of land carriage con&s;equently, or of the greater part of the inland commerce of the country.</P>
<P>BY regulating the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of land, it regulates that of the materials of all manufac|tures. By regulating the money price of labour, it regulates that of manufacturing art and indu&s;try. And by regulating both, it regulates that of the compleat manufacture. The money price of labour, and of every thing that is the produce either of land or labour, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily either ri&s;e or fall in proportion to the mo|ney price of corn.</P>
<P>THOUGH in con&s;equence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer &s;hould be enabled to &s;ell his corn for four &s;hillings the bu&s;hel in|&s;tead of three and &s;ixpence, and to pay his landlord a money rent proportionable to this ri&s;e in the money price of his produce; yet, if in con&s;equence of this ri&s;e in the price of corn, four &s;hillings will purcha&s;e no more goods of any other kind than three and &s;ix|pence

would have done before, neither the circum&s;tances of the farmer, nor tho&s;e of the landlord, will be in the &s;malle&s;t degree mended by this change. The farmer will not be able to cultivate better: the landlord will not be able to live better.</P>
<P>THAT degradation in the value of &s;ilver which is the effect of the fertility of the mines, and which operates equally, or very near equally, through the greater part of the commercial world, is a matter of very little con&s;equence to any particular country. The con&s;equent ri&s;e of all money prices, though it does not make tho&s;e who receive them really richer, does not make them really poorer. A &s;ervice of plate becomes really cheaper, and every thing el&s;e re|mains preci&s;ely of the &s;ame real value as before.</P>
<P>BUT that degradation in the value of &s;ilver which, being the effect either of the peculiar &s;ituation, or of the political in&s;titu|tions of a particular country, takes place only in that country, is a matter of very great con&s;equence, which, far from tending to make any body really richer, tends to make every body really poorer. The ri&s;e in the money price of all commodities, which is in this ca&s;e peculiar to that country, tends to di&s;courage more or le&s;s every &s;ort of indu&s;try which is carried on within it, and to enable foreign nations, by furni&s;hing almo&s;t all &s;orts of goods for a &s;maller quantity of &s;ilver than its own workmen can afford to do, to under&s;ell them, not only in the foreign, but even in the home market.</P>
<P>IT is the peculiar &s;ituation of Spain and Portugal, as proprietors of the mines, to be the di&s;tributors of gold and &s;ilver to all the other countries of Europe. Tho&s;e metals ought naturally, there|fore, to be &s;omewhat cheaper in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe. The difference, however, &s;hould be no
<PB N="96" REF="99">
more than the amount of the freight and in&s;urance; and, on ac|count of the great value and &s;mall bulk of tho&s;e metals, their freight is no great matter, and their in&s;urance is the &s;ame as that of any other goods of equal value. Spain and Portugal, there|fore, could &s;uffer very little from their peculiar &s;ituation, if they did not aggravate its di&s;advantages by their political in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>SPAIN by taxing, and Portugal by prohibiting the exportation of gold and &s;ilver, load that exportation with the expence of &s;mug|gling, and rai&s;e the value of tho&s;e metals in other countries &s;o much more above what it is in their own, by the whole amount of this expence. When you dam up a &s;tream of water, as &s;oon as the dam is full, as much water mu&s;t run over the dam-head as if there was no dam at all. The prohibition of exportation can|not detain a greater quantity of gold and &s;ilver in Spain and Por|tugal than what they can afford to employ, than what the annual produce of their land and labour will allow them to employ, in coin, plate, gilding, and other ornaments of gold and &s;ilver. When they have got this quantity the dam is full, and the whole &s;tream which flows in afterwards mu&s;t run over. The annual exportation of gold and &s;ilver from Spain and Portugal accordingly is, by all accounts, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e re&s;traints, very near equal to the whole annual importation. As the water, however, mu&s;t always be deeper behind the dam-head than before it, &s;o the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which the&s;e re&s;traints detain in Spain and Por|tugal mu&s;t, in proportion to the annual produce of their land and labour, be greater that what is to be found in other countries. The higher and &s;tronger the dam-head, the greater mu&s;t be the difference in the depth of water behind and before it. The higher the tax, the higher the penalties with which the prohibition is guard|ed, the more vigilant and &s;evere the police which looks after the execution of the law, the greater mu&s;t be the difference in the
<PB N="97" REF="100">
proportion of gold and &s;ilver to the annual produce of the land and labour of Spain and Portugal, and to that of other countries. It is &s;aid accordingly to be very con&s;iderable, and that you fre|quently find there a profu&s;ion of plate in hou&s;es, where there is nothing el&s;e which would, in other countries, be thought &s;uitable or corre&s;pondent to this &s;ort of magnificence. The cheapne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver, or, what is the &s;ame thing, the dearne&s;s of all commodities, which is the nece&s;&s;ary effect of this redundancy of the precious metals, di&s;courages both the agriculture and manufac|tures of Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to &s;upply them with many &s;orts of rude, and with almo&s;t all &s;orts of manu|factured produce, for a &s;maller quantity of gold and &s;ilver than what they them&s;elves can either rai&s;e or make them for at home. The tax and prohibition operate in two different ways. They not only lower very much the value of the precious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining there a certain quantity of tho&s;e metals which would otherwi&s;e flow over other countries, they keep up their value in tho&s;e other countries &s;omewhat above what it otherwi&s;e would be, and thereby give tho&s;e countries a double advan|tage in their commerce with Spain and Portugal. Open the flood|gates and there will pre&s;ently be le&s;s water above, and more below, the dam-head, and it will &s;oon come to a level in both places. Remove the tax and the prohibition, and as the quantity of gold and &s;ilver will dimini&s;h con&s;iderably in Spain and Portugal, &s;o it will increa&s;e &s;omewhat in other countries, and the value of tho&s;e metals, their proportion to the annual produce of land and labour, will &s;oon come to a level, or very near to a level, in all. The lo&s;s which Spain and Portugal could &s;u&s;tain by this exportation of their gold and &s;ilver would be altogether nominal and imaginary. The nominal value of their goods, and of the annual produce of their land and labour would fall, and would be expre&s;&s;ed or repre&s;ented by a &s;maller quantity of &s;ilver than before: but their real value would
<PB N="98" REF="101">
be the &s;ame as before, and would be &s;ufficient to maintain, com|mand, and employ, the &s;ame quantity of labour. As the nomi|nal value of their goods would fall, the real value of what re|mained of their gold and &s;ilver would ri&s;e, and a &s;maller quantity of tho&s;e metals would an&s;wer all the &s;ame purpo&s;es of commerce and circulation which had employed a greater quantity before. The gold and &s;ilver which would go abroad would not go abroad for nothing, but would bring back an equal value of goods of &s;ome kind or another. Tho&s;e goods too would not be all matters of mere luxury and expence, to be con&s;umed by idle people who pro|duce nothing in return for their con&s;umption. As the real wealth and revenue of idle people would not be augmented by this extraor|dinary exportation of gold and &s;ilver, &s;o neither would their con|&s;umption be much augmented by it. Tho&s;e goods would, proba|bly, the greater part of them, and certainly &s;ome part of them, con&s;i&s;t in materials, tools, and provi&s;ions, for the employment and maintenance of indu&s;trious people, who would reproduce, with a profit, the full value of their con&s;umption. A part of the dead &s;tock of the &s;ociety would thus be turned into active &s;tock, and would put into motion a greater quantity of indu&s;try than had been employed before. The annual produce of their land and labour would immediately be augmented a little, and in a few years would, probably, be augmented a great deal; their indu&s;try being thus relieved from one of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive burdens which it at pre|&s;ent labours under.</P>
<P>THE bounty upon the exportation of corn nece&s;&s;arily ope|rates exactly in the &s;ame way as this ab&s;urd policy of Spain and Portugal. Whatever be the actual &s;tate of tillage, it renders our corn &s;omewhat dearer in the home market than it otherwi&s;e would be in that &s;tate, and &s;omewhat cheaper in the foreign; and as the average money price of corn regulates more or le&s;s that of
<PB N="99" REF="102">
all other commodities, it lowers the value of &s;ilver con&s;iderably in the one, and tends to rai&s;e it a little in the other. It enables foreigners, the Dutch in particular, not only to eat our corn cheaper than they otherwi&s;e could do, but &s;ometimes to eat it cheaper than even our own people can do upon the &s;ame occa|&s;ions; as we are a&s;&s;ured by an excellent authority, that of Sir Mathew Decker. It hinders our own workmen from furni&s;hing their goods for &s;o &s;mall a quantity of &s;ilver as they otherwi&s;e might do; and enables the Dutch to furni&s;h their's for a &s;maller. It tends to render our manufactures &s;omewhat dearer in every market, and their's &s;omewhat cheaper than they otherwi&s;e would be, and con&s;equently to give their indu&s;try a double advantage over our own.</P>
<P>THE bounty, as it rai&s;es in the home market, not the real, but only the nominal price of our corn, as it augments, not the quantity of labour which a certain quantity of corn can maintain and employ, but only the quantity of &s;ilver which it will exchange for, it di&s;courages our manufactures without rendering the &s;malle&s;t real &s;ervice either to our farmers or country gentlemen. It puts, indeed, a little more money into the pockets of both, and it will perhaps be &s;omewhat difficult to per&s;uade the greater part of them that this is not rendering them a very real &s;ervice. But if this money &s;inks in its value, in the quantity of labour, provi&s;ions, and commodities of all different kinds which it is capable of pur|cha&s;ing, as much as it ri&s;es in its quantity, the &s;ervice will be merely nominal and imaginary.</P>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, but one &s;et of men in the whole com|monwealth to whom the bounty either was or could be really &s;erviceable. The&s;e were the corn merchants, the exporters and importers of corn. In years of plenty the bounty nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="100" REF="103">
occa&s;ioned a greater exportation than would otherwi&s;e have taken place; and by hindering the plenty of one year from relieving the &s;carcity of another, it occa&s;ioned in years of &s;carcity a greater importation than would otherwi&s;e have been nece&s;&s;ary. It in|crea&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the corn merchant in both, and in years of &s;carcity it not only enabled him to import a greater quantity, but to &s;ell it for a better price, and con&s;equently with a greater profit than he could otherwi&s;e have made, if the plenty of one year had not been more or le&s;s hindered from relieving the &s;car|city of another. It is in this &s;ett of men, accordingly, that I have ob&s;erved the greate&s;t zeal for the continuance or renewal of the bounty.</P>
<P>OUR country gentlemen, when they impo&s;ed the high duties upon the importation of foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, and when they e&s;tabli&s;hed the bounty, &s;eem to have imitated the conduct of our manufacturers. By the one in&s;titution, they &s;ecured to them&s;elves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other they endeavoured to prevent that market from ever being over&s;tocked with their commodity. By both they endeavoured to rai&s;e its real value, in the &s;ame man|ner as our manufacturers had, by the like in&s;titutions, rai&s;ed the real value of many different &s;orts of manufactured goods. They did not perhaps attend to the great and e&s;&s;ential difference which nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed between corn and almo&s;t every other &s;ort of goods. When either by the monopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon exportation, you enable our woollen or linen manufacturers to &s;ell their goods for &s;omewhat a better price than they otherwi&s;e could get for them, you rai&s;e, not only the nomi|nal, but the real price of tho&s;e goods. You render them equiva|lent to a greater quantity of labour and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, you increa&s;e, not only the nominal, but the real profit, the real wealth and
<PB N="101" REF="104">
revenue of tho&s;e manufacturers, and you enable them either to live better them&s;elves, or to employ a greater quantity of labour in tho&s;e particular manufactures. You really encourage tho&s;e manufactures, and direct towards them a greater quantity of the indu&s;try of the country, than what would probably go to them of its own accord. But when by the like in&s;titutions you rai&s;e the nominal or money price of corn, you do not rai&s;e its real value. You do not increa&s;e the real wealth, the real revenue either of our farmers or country gentlemen. You do not encou|rage the growth of corn, becau&s;e you do not enable them to maintain and employ more labourers in rai&s;ing it. The nature of things has &s;tamped upon corn a real value which no human in&s;titution can alter. No bounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the home market can rai&s;e it. The free&s;t competition cannot lower it. Through the world in general that value is equal to the quantity of labour which it can maintain, and in every par|ticular place it is equal to the quantity of labour which it can maintain in the way, whether liberal, moderate, or &s;canty, in which labour is commonly maintained in that place. Woollen or linen cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the real value of all other commodities mu&s;t be finally mea&s;ured and determined. Corn is. The real value of every other commodity is finally mea&s;ured and determined by the proportion which its average money price bears to the average money price of corn. The real value of corn does not vary with tho&s;e variations in its average money price, which &s;ometimes occur from one century to another. It is the real value of &s;ilver which varies with them.</P>
<P>BOUNTIES upon the exportation of any home-made commodity are liable, fir&s;t, to that general objection which may be made to all the different expedients of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem; the objection of forcing &s;ome part of the indu&s;try of the country into a channel
<PB N="102" REF="105">
le&s;s advantageous than that in which it would run of its own accord: and, &s;econdly, to the particular objection of forcing it, not only into a channel that is le&s;s advantageous, but into one that is actually di&s;advantageous; the trade which cannot be carried on but by means of a bounty being nece&s;&s;arily a lo&s;ting trade. The bounty upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection, that it can in no re&s;pect promote the rai&s;ing of that par|ticular commodity of which it was meant to encourage the produc|tion. When our country gentlemen, therefore, demanded the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the bounty, though they acted in imitation of our merchants and manufacturers, they did not act with that com|pleat comprehen&s;ion of their own intere&s;t which commonly directs the conduct of tho&s;e two other orders of people. They loaded the publick revenue with a very con&s;iderable expence; but they did not in any re&s;pect increa&s;e the real value of their own commodity, and by lowering &s;omewhat the real value of &s;ilver they di&s;couraged in &s;ome degree the general indu&s;try of the country, and in&s;tead of advancing, retarded more or le&s;s the improvement of their own lands, which nece&s;&s;arily depends upon the general indu&s;try of the country.</P>
<P>To encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon production, one &s;hould imagine, would have a more direct operation than one upon exportation. It has, however, been more rarely granted. The prejudices e&s;tabli&s;hed by the commer|cial &s;y&s;tem have taught us to believe that national wealth ari&s;es more immediately from exportation than from production. It has been more favoured accordingly, as the more immediate means of bringing money into the country. Bounties upon production, it has been &s;aid too, have been found by experience more liable to frauds than tho&s;e upon exportation. How far this is true, I know not. That bounties upon exportation have been abu&s;ed to many
<PB N="103" REF="106">
fraudulent purpo&s;es, is very well known. But it is not the intere&s;t of merchants and manufacturers, the great inventors of all the&s;e expedients, that the home market &s;hould be over&s;tocked with their goods, an event which a bounty upon production might &s;ome|times occa&s;ion. A bounty upon exportation, by enabling them to &s;end abroad the &s;urplus part, and to keep up the price of what remains in the home market, effectually prevents this. Of all the expedients of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, accordingly, it is the one of which they are the fonde&s;t. I have known the different under|takers of &s;ome particular works agree privately among them&s;elves to give a bounty out of their own pockets upon the exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which they dealt in. This expedient &s;ucceeded &s;o well that it more than doubled the price of their goods in the home market, notwith&s;tanding a very con&s;ider|able increa&s;e in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn mu&s;t have been wonderfully different, if it has lowered the money price of that commodity.</P>
<P>SOMETHING like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions. The encourage|ments given to the white-herring and whale-fi&s;heries may, perhaps, be con&s;idered as &s;omewhat of this nature. They tend directly to render the goods cheaper in the home market than they otherwi&s;e would be in the actual production. In other re&s;pects their effects are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of bounties upon exportation. By means of them a part of the capital of the country is em|ployed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does not repay the co&s;t, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock. But though the bounties to tho&s;e fi&s;heries do not contribute to the opulence of the nation, they may perhaps be defended as con|ducing to its defence, by augmenting the number of its &s;ailors and &s;hipping. This may frequently be done by means of &s;uch
<PB N="104" REF="107">
bounties, at a much &s;maller expence than by keeping up a great &s;tanding navy, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, in time of peace, in the &s;ame manner as a &s;tanding army.</P>
<P>SOME other bounties may be vindicated perhaps upon the &s;ame principle. It is of importance that the kingdom &s;hould depend as little as po&s;&s;ible upon its neighbours for the manufactures nece&s;&s;ary for its defence; and if the&s;e cannot otherwi&s;e be main|tained at home, it is rea&s;onable that all other branches of indu&s;try &s;hould be taxed in order to &s;upport them. The bounties upon the importation of naval &s;tores from America, upon Briti&s;h made fail-cloth, and upon Briti&s;h made gunpowder, may perhaps all three be vindicated upon this principle. The fir&s;t is a bounty upon the production of America, for the u&s;e of Great Britain. The two others are bounties upon exportation.</P>
<P>WHAT is called a bounty is &s;ometimes no more than a drawback, and con&s;equently is not liable to the &s;ame objections as what is properly a bounty. The bounty, for example, upon refined &s;ugar exported may be con&s;idered as a drawback of the duties upon the brown and mu&s;covado &s;ugars, from which it is made. The bounty upon wrought &s;ilk exported, a drawback of the duties upon raw and thrown &s;ilk imported. The bounty upon gun|powder exported, a drawback of the duties upon brim&s;tone and &s;altpetre imported. In the language of the cu&s;toms tho&s;e allow|ances only are called drawbacks, which are given upon goods exported in the &s;ame form in which they are imported. When that form has been altered by manufacture of any kind, they are called bounties.</P>
<P>PREMIUMS given by the publick to arti&s;ts and manufacturers who excell in their particular occupations, are not liable to the &s;ame objections as bounties. By encouraging extraordinary dex|terity
<PB N="105" REF="108">
and ingenuity, they &s;erve to keep up the emulation of the workmen actually employed in tho&s;e re&s;pective occupations, and are not con&s;iderable enough to turn towards any one of them a greater &s;hare of the capital of the country than what would go to it of its own accord. Their tendency is not to overturn the natural balance of employments, but to render the work which is done in each as perfect and compleat as po&s;&s;ible. The expence of premiums, be&s;ides, is very trifling; that of bounties very great. The bounty upon corn alone has &s;ometimes co&s;t the publick in one year, more than three hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>BOUNTIES are &s;ometimes called premiums, as drawbacks are &s;ometimes called bounties. But we mu&s;t in all ca&s;es attend to the nature of the thing, without paying any regard to the word.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude this chapter concerning bounties, with|out ob&s;erving that the prai&s;es which have been be&s;towed upon the law which e&s;tabli&s;hes the bounty upon the exportation of corn, and upon that &s;y&s;tem of regulations which is connected with it, are altogether unmerited. A particular examination of the nature of the corn trade, and of the principal Briti&s;h laws which relate to it, will &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. The great importance of this &s;ubject mu&s;t ju&s;tify the length of the digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE trade of the corn merchant is compo&s;ed of four different branches, which, though they may &s;ometimes be all carried on by the &s;ame per&s;on, are in their own nature four &s;eparate and di&s;tinct trades. The&s;e are, fir&s;t, the trade of the inland dealer; &s;econdly, that of the merchant importer for home con&s;umption; thirdly, that of the merchant exporter of home produce for foreign con|&s;umption; and, fourthly, that of the merchant carrier, or of the importer of corn in order to export it again.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="106" REF="109">
I. THE intere&s;t of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of the people, how oppo&s;ite &s;oever they may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, are, even in years of the greate&s;t &s;carcity, exactly the &s;ame. It is his intere&s;t to rai&s;e the price of his corn as high as the real &s;carcity of the &s;ea&s;on requires, and it can never be his intere&s;t to rai&s;e it higher. By rai&s;ing the price he di&s;courages the con&s;umption, and puts every body more or le&s;s, but particularly the inferior ranks of people, upon thrift and good management. If, by rai&s;ing it too high, he di&s;courages the con&s;umption &s;o much that the &s;upply of the &s;ea&s;on is likely to go beyond the con&s;umption of the &s;ea&s;on, and to la&s;t for &s;ome time after the next crop begins to come in, he runs the hazard, not only of lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable part of his corn by natural cau&s;es, but of being obliged to &s;ell what remains of it for much le&s;s than what he might have had for it &s;everal months before. If by not rai&s;ing the price high enough he di&s;courages the con&s;umption &s;o little, that the &s;upply of the &s;ea&s;on is likely to fall &s;hort of the con&s;umption of the &s;ea&s;on, he not only lo&s;es a part of the profit which he might otherwi&s;e have made, but he expo&s;es the people to &s;uffer before the end of the &s;ea&s;on, in&s;tead of the hard|&s;hips of a dearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine. It is the intere&s;t of the people that their daily, weekly, and monthly con|&s;umption, &s;hould be proportioned as exactly as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;up|ply of the &s;ea&s;on. The intere&s;t of the inland corn dealer is the &s;ame. By &s;upplying them, as nearly as he can judge, in this pro|portion, he is likely to &s;ell all his corn for the highe&s;t price, and with the greate&s;t profit; and his knowledge of the &s;tate of the crop, and of his daily, weekly, and monthly &s;ales, enable him to judge, with more or le&s;s accuracy, how far they really are &s;upplied in this manner. Without intending the intere&s;t of the people, he is nece&s;&s;arily led, by a regard to his own intere&s;t, to treat them, even in years of &s;carcity, pretty much in the &s;ame manner as the pru|dent ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el is &s;ometimes obliged to treat his crew. When
<PB N="107" REF="110">
he fore&s;ees that provi&s;ions are likely to run &s;hort, he puts them upon &s;hort allowance. Though from exce&s;s of caution he &s;hould &s;ometimes do this without any real nece&s;&s;ity, yet all the inconveni|encies which his crew can thereby &s;uffer are incon&s;iderable in com|pari&s;on of the danger, mi&s;ery, and ruin, to which they might &s;ometimes be expo&s;ed by a le&s;s provident conduct. Though from exce&s;s of avarice, in the &s;ame manner, the inland corn merchant &s;hould &s;ometimes rai&s;e the price of his corn &s;omewhat higher than the &s;carcity of the &s;ea&s;on requires, yet all the inconveniencies which the people can &s;uffer from this conduct, which effectually &s;ecures them from a famine in the end of the &s;ea&s;on, are incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on of what they might have been expo&s;ed to by a more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it. The corn merchant him&s;elf is likely to &s;uffer the mo&s;t by this exce&s;s of avarice; not only from the indignation which it generally excites again&s;t him, but, though he &s;hould e&s;cape the effects of this indignation, from the quantity of corn which it nece&s;&s;arily leaves upon his hands in the end of the &s;ea&s;on, and which, if the next &s;ea&s;on happens to prove favourable, he mu&s;t always fell for a much lower price than he might otherwi&s;e have had.</P>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible, indeed, for one great company of merchants to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the whole crop of an exten&s;ive country, it might, perhaps, be their intere&s;t to deal with it as the Dutch are &s;aid to do with the &s;piceries of the Molluccas, to de&s;troy or throw away a con&s;iderable part of it, in order to keep up the price of the re&s;t. But it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, even by the violence of law, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h &s;uch an exten&s;ive monopoly with regard to corn; and, where|ever the law leaves the trade free, it is of all commodities the lea&s;t liable to be engro&s;&s;ed or monopoli&s;ed by the force of a few large capitals, which buy up the greater part of it. Not only its value far exceeds what the capitals of a few private men are capable of
<PB N="108" REF="111">
purcha&s;ing, but, &s;uppo&s;ing they were capable of purcha&s;ing it, the manner in which it is produced renders this purcha&s;e altogether impracticable. As in every civilized country it is the commodity of which the annual con&s;umption is the greate&s;t, &s;o a greater quan|tity of indu&s;try is annually employed in producing corn than in producing any other commodity. When it fir&s;t comes from the ground too, it is nece&s;&s;arily divided among a greater number of owners than any other commodity; and the&s;e owners can never be collected into one place like a number of independent manufactu|rers, but are nece&s;&s;arily &s;cattered through all the different corners of the country. The&s;e fir&s;t owners either immediately &s;upply the con&s;umers in their own neighbourhood, or they &s;upply other inland dealers who &s;upply tho&s;e con&s;umers. The inland dealers in corn, therefore, including both the farmer and the baker, are nece&s;&s;a|rily more numerous than the dealers in any other commodity, and their di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation renders it altogether impo&s;&s;ible for them to enter into any general combination. If in a year of &s;carcity, there|fore, any of them &s;hould find that he had a good deal more corn upon hand than, at the current price, he could hope to di&s;po&s;e of before the end of the &s;ea&s;on, he would never think of keeping up this price to his own lo&s;s, and to the &s;ole benefit of his rivals and competitors, but would immediately lower it in order to get rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in. The &s;ame mo|tives, the &s;ame intere&s;ts, which would thus regulate the conduct of any one dealer, would regulate that of every other, and oblige them all in general to fell their corn at the price which, according to the be&s;t of their judgement, was mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;carcity or plenty of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>WHOEVER examines, with attention, the hi&s;tory of the dearths and famines which have afflicted any part of Europe, during either the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent or that of the two preceeding centuries,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
of &s;everal of which we have pretty exact accounts, will find, I believe, that a dearth never has ari&s;en from any combination among the inland dealers in corn, nor from any other cau&s;e but a real &s;car|city, occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes perhaps, and in &s;ome particular places, by the wa&s;te of war, but in by far the greate&s;t number of ca&s;es, by the fault of the &s;ea&s;ons; and that a famine has never ari&s;en from any other cau&s;e but the violence of government attempting, by improper means, to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth.</P>
<P>IN an exten&s;ive corn country, between all the different parts of which there is a free commerce and communication, the &s;carcity occa&s;ioned by the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons can never be &s;o great as to produce a famine; and the &s;cantie&s;t crop, if managed with frugality and oeconomy, will maintain, through the year, the &s;ame number of people that are commonly fed in a more affluent man|ner by one of moderate plenty. The &s;ea&s;ons mo&s;t unfavourable to the crop are tho&s;e of exce&s;&s;ive drought or exce&s;&s;ive rain. But, as corn grows equally upon high and low lands, upon grounds that are di&s;po&s;ed to be too wet, and upon tho&s;e that are di&s;po&s;ed to be too dry, either the drought or the rain which is hurtful to one part of the country is favourable to another; and though both in the wet and in the dry &s;ea&s;on the crop is a good deal le&s;s than in one more properly tempered, yet in both what is lo&s;t in one part of the country is in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated by what is gained in the other. In rice countries, where the crop not only requires a very moi&s;t &s;oil, but where in a certain period of its growing it mu&s;t be laid under water, the effects of a drought are much more di&s;|mal. Even in &s;uch countries, however, the drought is, perhaps, &s;carce ever &s;o univer&s;al as nece&s;&s;arily to occa&s;ion a famine, if the government would allow a free trade. The drought in Bengal, a few years ago, might probably have occa&s;ioned a very great dearth. Some improper regulations, &s;ome injudicious re&s;traints impo&s;ed by
<PB N="110" REF="113">
the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Company upon the rice trade, con|tributed, perhaps, to turn that dearth into a famine.</P>
<P>WHEN the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth, orders all the dealers to &s;ell their corn at what it &s;up|po&s;es a rea&s;onable price, it either hinders them from bringing it to market, which may &s;ometimes produce a famine, even in the begin|ning of the &s;ea&s;on; or if they bring it thither, it enables the peo|ple, and thereby encourages them to con&s;ume it &s;o fa&s;t, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce a famine before the end of the &s;ea&s;on. The unlimited, unre&s;trained freedom of the corn trade, as it is the only effectual preventative of the mi&s;eries of a famine, &s;o it is the be&s;t palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the incon|veniencies of a real &s;carcity cannot be remedied; they can only be palliated. No trade de&s;erves more the full protection of the law, and no trade requires it &s;o much; becau&s;e no trade is &s;o much ex|po&s;ed to popular odium.</P>
<P>IN years of &s;carcity the inferior ranks of people impute their di&s;tre&s;s to the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the ob|ject of their hatred and indignation. In&s;tead of making profit upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, therefore, he is often in danger of being utterly ruined, and of having his magazines plundered and de|&s;troyed by their violence. It is in years of &s;carcity, however, when prices are high, that the corn merchant expects to make his principal profit. He is generally in contract with &s;ome farmers to furni&s;h him for a certain number of years with a certain quan|tity of corn at a certain price. This contract price is &s;ettled ac|cording to what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the moderate and rea&s;onable, that is, the ordinary or average price, which, before the late years of &s;carcity, was commonly about eight and twenty &s;hillings for the quarter of wheat, and for that of other grain in proportion.
<PB N="111" REF="114">
In years of &s;carcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a great part of his corn for the ordinary price, and &s;ells it for a much higher. That this extraordinary profit, however, is no more than &s;ufficient to put his trade upon a fair level with other trades, and to compen|&s;ate the many lo&s;&s;es which he &s;u&s;tains upon other occa&s;ions, both from the peri&s;hable nature of the commodity it&s;elf, and from the frequent and unfore&s;een fluctuations of its price, &s;eems evident enough, from this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, that great fortunes are as &s;eldom made in this as in any other trade. The popular odium, however, which attends it in years of &s;carcity, the only years in which it can be very profitable, renders people of character and fortune aver&s;e to enter into it. It is abandoned to an inferior &s;ett of dealers; and millers, bakers, mealmen and meal factors, toge|ther with a number of wretched huck&s;ters, are almo&s;t the only middle people that, in the home market, come between the grower and the con&s;umer.</P>
<P>THE ancient policy of Europe, in&s;tead of di&s;countenancing this popular odium again&s;t a trade &s;o beneficial to the publick, &s;eems, on the contrary, to have authori&s;ed and encouraged it.</P>
<P>BY the 5th and 6th of Edward VI. cap. 14. it was enacted, That whoever &s;hould buy any corn or grain with intent to &s;ell it again, &s;hould be reputed an unlawful engro&s;&s;er, and &s;hould, for the fir&s;t fault, &s;uffer two months impri&s;onment, and forfeit the value of the corn; for the &s;econd, &s;uffer &s;ix months impri&s;on|ment, and forfeit double the value; and for the third, be &s;et in the pillory, &s;uffer impri&s;onment during the king's plea&s;ure, and forfeit all his goods and chattels. The antient policy of mo&s;t other parts of Europe was no better than that of England.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115">
OUR ance&s;tors &s;eem to have imagined that the people would buy their corn cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant, who, they were afraid, would require, over and above the price which he paid to the farmer, an exorbitant profit to him&s;elf. They endeavoured, therefore, to annihilate his trade altogether. They even endeavoured to hinder as much as po&s;&s;ible any middle man of any kind from coming in between the grower and the con&s;umer; and this was the meaning of the many re&s;traints which they impo&s;ed upon the trade of tho&s;e whom they called kidders or carries of corn, a trade which nobody was allowed to exerci&s;e without a licence a&s;certaining his qualifications as a man of probity and fair dealing. The authority of three ju&s;tices of the peace was, by the &s;tatute of Edward VI. nece&s;&s;ary, in order to grant this licence. But even this re&s;traint was afterwards thought in&s;ufficient, and by a &s;tatute of Elizabeth, the privilege of granting it was confined to the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE antient policy of Europe endeavoured in this manner to regulate agriculture, the great trade of the country, by maxims quite different from tho&s;e which it e&s;tabli&s;hed with regard to ma|nufactures, the great trade of the towns. By leaving the farmer no other cu&s;tomers but either the con&s;umer or his immediate factors, the kidders and carriers of corn, it endeavoured to force him to exerci&s;e the trade, not only of a farmer, but of a corn merchant or corn retailer. On the contrary, it in many ca&s;es prohibited the manufacturer from exerci&s;ing the trade of a &s;hop|keeper, or from &s;elling his own goods by retail. It meant by the one law to promote the general intere&s;t of the country, or to ren|der corn cheap, without, perhaps, its being well under&s;tood how this was to be done. By the other it meant to promote that of a particular order of men, the &s;hopkeepers, who would be &s;o
<PB N="113" REF="116">
much under&s;old by the manufacturer, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that their trade would be ruined if he was allowed to retail at all.</P>
<P>THE manufacturer, however, though he had been allowed to keep a &s;hop, and to &s;ell his own goods by retail, could not have under&s;old the common &s;hopkeeper. Whatever part of his capital he might have placed in his &s;hop, he mu&s;t have withdrawn it from his manufacture. In order to carry on his bu&s;ine&s;s on a level with that of other people, as he mu&s;t have had the profit of a manufacturer on the one part, &s;o he mu&s;t have had that of a &s;hopkeeper upon the other. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that in the particular town where he lived, ten per cent. was the ordi|nary profit both of manufacturing and &s;hopkeeping &s;tock; he mu&s;t in this ca&s;e have charged upon every piece of his own goods which he &s;old in his &s;hop, a profit of twenty per cent. When he carried them from his workhou&s;e to his &s;hop, he mu&s;t have valued them at the price for which he could have &s;old them to a dealer or &s;hopkeeper, who would have bought them by whole&s;ale. If he valued them lower, he lo&s;t a part of the profit of his manu|facturing capital. When again he &s;old them from his &s;hop, unle&s;s he got the &s;ame price at which a &s;hopkeeper would have &s;old them, he lo&s;t a part of the profit of his &s;hopkeeping capital. Though he might appear, therefore, to make a double profit upon the &s;ame piece of goods, yet as the&s;e goods made &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a part of two di&s;tinct capitals, he made but a &s;ingle profit upon the whole capital employed about them; and if he made le&s;s than this profit, he was a lo&s;er, or did not employ his whole capital with the &s;ame advantage as the greater part of his neighbours.</P>
<P>WHAT the manufacturer was prohibited to do, the farmer was in &s;ome mea&s;ure enjoined to do; to divide his capital between two different employments; to keep one part of it in his grana|ries
<PB N="114" REF="117">
and &s;tack yard, for &s;upplying the occa&s;ional demands of the market; and to employ the other in the cultivation of his land. But as he could not afford to employ the latter for le&s;s than the ordinary profits of farming &s;tock, &s;o he could as little afford to employ the former for le&s;s than the ordinary profits of mercantile &s;tock. Whether the &s;tock which really carried on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the corn merchant belonged to the per&s;on who was called a farmer, or to the per&s;on who was called a corn merchant, an equal profit was in both ca&s;es requi&s;ite, in order to indemnify its owner for employing it in this manner; in order to put his bu&s;ine&s;s upon a level with other trades, and in order to hinder him from having an intere&s;t to change it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for &s;ome other. The farmer, therefore, who was thus forced to exerci&s;e the trade of a corn merchant, could not afford to &s;ell his corn cheaper than any other corn merchant would have been obliged to do in the ca&s;e of a free competition.</P>
<P>THE dealer who can employ his whole &s;tock in one &s;ingle branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, has an advantage of the &s;ame kind with the workman who can employ his whole labour in one &s;ingle opera|tion. As the latter acquires a dexterity which enables him, with the &s;ame two hands, to perform a much greater quantity of work; &s;o the former acquires &s;o ea&s;y and ready a method of tran&s;acting his bu&s;ine&s;s, of buying and di&s;po&s;ing of his goods, that with the &s;ame capital he can tran&s;act a much greater quan|tity of bu&s;ine&s;s. As the one can commonly afford his work a good deal cheaper, &s;o the other can commonly afford his goods &s;ome|what cheaper than if his &s;tock and attention were both employed about a greater variety of objects. The greater part of manu|facturers could not afford to retail their own goods &s;o cheap as a vigilant and active &s;hopkeeper, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it was to buy them by whole&s;ale, and to retail them again. The greater part of farmers could &s;till le&s;s afford to retail their own corn, or to &s;upply
<PB N="115" REF="118">
the inhabitants of a town, at perhaps four or five miles di&s;tance from the greater part of them, &s;o cheap as a vigilant and active corn merchant, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it was to purcha&s;e corn by whole&s;ale, to collect it into a great magazine, and to retail it again.</P>
<P>THE law which prohibited the manufacturer from exerci&s;ing the trade of a &s;hopkeeper, endeavoured to force this divi&s;ion in the employment of &s;tock to go on fa&s;ter than it might otherwi&s;e have done. The law which obliged the farmer to exercife the trade of a corn merchant, endeavoured to hinder it from going on &s;o fa&s;t. Both laws were evident violations of natural liberty, and there|fore unju&s;t; and they were both too as impolitick as they were unju&s;t. It is the intere&s;t of every &s;ociety, that things of this kind &s;hould never either be forced or ob&s;tructed. The man who em|ploys either his labour or his &s;tock in a greater variety of ways than his &s;ituation renders nece&s;&s;ary, can never hurt his neigh|bour by under&s;elling him. He may hurt him&s;elf, and he gene|rally does &s;o. Jack of all trades will never be rich, &s;ays the proverb. But the law ought always to tru&s;t people with the care of their own intere&s;t, as in their local &s;ituations they mu&s;t gene|rally be able to judge better of it than the legi&s;lator can do. The law, however, which obliged the farmer to exerci&s;e the trade of a corn merchant, was by far the mo&s;t pernicious of the two.</P>
<P>IT ob&s;tructed, not only that divi&s;ion in the employment of &s;tock which is &s;o advantageous to every &s;ociety, but it ob&s;tructed likewi&s;e the improvement and cultivation of the land. By oblig|ing the farmer to carry on two trades in&s;tead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into two parts, of which one only could be employed in cultivation. But if he had been at liberty to &s;ell his whole crop to a corn merchant as fa&s;t as he could thre&s;h it out,
<PB N="116" REF="119">
his whole capital might have returned immediately to the land, and have been employed in buying more cattle, and hiring more &s;ervants, in order to improve and cultivate it better. But by being obliged to &s;ell his corn by retail, he was obliged to keep a great part of his capital in his granaries and &s;tack yard through the year, and could not, therefore, cultivate &s;o well as with the &s;ame capital he might otherwi&s;e have done. This law, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily ob&s;tructed the improvement of the land, and, in&s;tead of tending to render corn cheaper, mu&s;t have tended to render it &s;carcer, and therefore dearer, than it would otherwi&s;e have been.</P>
<P>AFTER the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farmer, that of the corn merchant is in reality the trade which, if properly protected and encou|raged, would contribute the mo&s;t to the rai&s;ing of corn. It would &s;upport the trade of the farmer in the &s;ame manner as the trade of the whole&s;ale dealer &s;upports that of the manu|facturer.</P>
<P>THE whole&s;ale dealer, by affording a ready market to the ma|nufacturer, by taking his goods off his hand as fa&s;t as he can make them, and by &s;ometimes even advancing their price to him before he has made them, enables him to keep his whole capital, and &s;ometimes even more than his whole capital, con&s;tantly em|ployed in manufacturing, and con&s;equently to manufacture a much greater quantity of goods than if he was obliged to di&s;|po&s;e of them him&s;elf to the immediate con&s;umers, or even to the retailers. As the capital of the whole&s;ale merchant too is ge|nerally &s;ufficient to replace that of many manufacturers, this in|tercour&s;e between him and them intere&s;ts the owner of a large capital to &s;upport the owners of a great number of &s;mall ones, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes which might otherwi&s;e prove ruinous to them.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="120">
AN intercour&s;e of the &s;ame kind univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed between the farmers and the corn merchants, would be attended with effects equally beneficial to the farmers. They would be enabled to keep their whole capitals, and even more than their whole capitals, con&s;tantly employed in cultivation. In ca&s;e of any of tho&s;e accidents, to which no trade is more liable than theirs, they would find in their ordinary cu&s;tomer, the wealthy corn merchant, a per&s;on who had both an intere&s;t to &s;upport them, and the ability to do it, and they would not, as at pre&s;ent, be entirely dependent upon the forbearance of their landlord, or the mercy of his &s;teward. Were it po&s;&s;ible, as perhaps it is not, to e&s;tabli&s;h this intercour&s;e univer&s;ally, and all at once, were it po&s;|&s;ible to turn all at once the whole farming &s;tock of the kingdom to its proper bu&s;ine&s;s, the cultivation of land, withdrawing it from every other employment into which any part of it may be at pre&s;ent diverted, and were it po&s;&s;ible, in order to &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t upon occa&s;ion the operations of this great &s;tock, to provide all at once another &s;tock almo&s;t equally great, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to imagine how great, how exten&s;ive, and how &s;udden would be the improvement which this change of circum&s;tances would alone produce upon the whole face of the country.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute of Edward VI. therefore, by prohibiting as much as po&s;&s;ible any middle man from coming in between the grower and the con&s;umer, endeavoured to annihilate a trade of which the free exerci&s;e is not only the be&s;t palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth, but the be&s;t preventative of that calamity: after the trade of the farmer, no trade contributing &s;o much to the grow|ing of corn as that of the corn merchant.</P>
<P>THE rigour of this law was afterwards &s;oftened by &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes, which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively permitted the engro&s;&s;ing of corn when the price of wheat &s;hould not exceed twenty, twenty|four, thirty-two, and forty &s;hillings the quarter. At la&s;t, by the
<PB N="118" REF="121">
15th of Charles II. c. 7. the engro&s;&s;ing or buying of corn in order to &s;ell it again, as long as the price of wheat did not exceed forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, and that of other grain in pro|portion, was declared lawful to all per&s;ons not being fore&s;tallers, that is, not &s;elling again in the &s;ame market within three months. All the freedom which the trade of the inland corn dealer has ever yet enjoyed, was be&s;towed upon it by this &s;tatute. The &s;tatute of the twelfth of the pre&s;ent king, which repeals almo&s;t all the other antient laws again&s;t engro&s;&s;ers and fore&s;tallers, does not repeal the re&s;trictions of this particular &s;tatute, which there|fore &s;till continue in force.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tatute, however, authorizes in &s;ome mea&s;ure two very ab&s;urd popular prejudices.</P>
<P>FIRST, it &s;uppo&s;es that when the price of wheat has ri&s;en &s;o high as forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion, corn is likely to be &s;o engro&s;&s;ed as to hurt the people. But from what has been already &s;aid, it &s;eems evident enough that corn can at no price be &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by the inland dealers as to hurt the people; and forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter be&s;ides, though it may be con&s;idered as a very high price, yet in years of &s;carcity it is a price which frequently takes place immediately after harve&s;t, when &s;carce any part of the new crop can be &s;old off, and when it is impo&s;&s;ible even for ignorance to &s;uppo&s;e that any part of it can be &s;o engro&s;&s;ed as to hurt the people.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it &s;uppo&s;es that there is a certain price at which corn is likely to be fore&s;talled, that is, bought up in order to be &s;old again &s;oon after in the &s;ame market, &s;o as to hurt the people. But if a mer|chant ever buys up corn, either going to a particular market or in a particular market, in order to &s;ell it again &s;oon after in the &s;ame mar|ket,
<PB N="119" REF="122">
it mu&s;t be becau&s;e he judges that the market cannot be &s;o libe|rally &s;upplied through the whole &s;ea&s;on as upon that particular occa|&s;ion, and that the price, therefore, mu&s;t &s;oon ri&s;e. If he judges wrong in this, and if the price does not ri&s;e, he not only lo&s;es the whole profit of the &s;tock which he employs in this manner, but a part of the &s;tock it&s;elf, by the expence and lo&s;s which nece&s;&s;arily attends the &s;toring and keeping of corn. He hurts him&s;elf, therefore, much more e&s;&s;entially than he can hurt even the particular people whom he may hinder from &s;upplying them&s;elves upon that particu|lar market day, becau&s;e they may afterwards &s;upply them&s;elves ju&s;t as cheap upon any other market day. If he judges right, in&s;tead of hurting the great body of the people, he renders them a mo&s;t im|portant &s;ervice. By making them feel the inconveniencies of a dearth &s;omewhat earlier than they otherwi&s;e might do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards &s;o &s;everely as they certainly would do, if the cheapne&s;s of price encouraged them to con&s;ume fa&s;ter than &s;uited the real &s;carcity of the &s;ea&s;on. When the &s;oarcity is real, the be&s;t thing that can be done for the people is to divide the inconveniencies of it as equally as po&s;&s;ible through all the diffe|rent months, and weeks, and days of the year. The intere&s;t of the corn merchant makes him &s;tudy to do this as exactly as he can; and as no other per&s;on can have either the &s;ame intere&s;t, or the &s;ame knowledge, or the &s;ame abilities to do it &s;o exactly as he, this mo&s;t important operation of commerce ought to be tru&s;ted entirely to him; or, in other words, the corn trade, &s;o far at lea&s;t as concerns the &s;upply of the home market, ought to be left per|fectly free.</P>
<P>THE popular fear of engro&s;&s;ing and fore&s;talling may be com|pared to the popular terrors and &s;u&s;picions of witchcraft. The unfortunate wretches accu&s;ed of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes imputed to them, than tho&s;e who
<PB N="120" REF="123">
have been accu&s;ed of the former. The law which put an end to all pro&s;ecutions again&s;t witchcraft, which put it out of any man's power to gratify his own malice by accu&s;ing his neighbour of that imaginary crime, &s;eems effectually to have put an end to tho&s;e fears and &s;u&s;picions, by taking away the great cau&s;e which encouraged and &s;upported them. The law which &s;hould re&s;tore entire freedom to the inland trade of corn, would probably prove as effectual to put an end to the popular fears of engro&s;&s;ing and fore&s;talling.</P>
<P>THE 15th of Charles II. c. 7. however, with all its imperfec|tions, has perhaps contributed more both to the plentiful &s;upply of the home market, and to the increa&s;e of tillage, than any other law in the &s;tatute book. It is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the liberty and protection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both the &s;upply of the home market, and the inte|re&s;t of tillage, are much more effectually promoted by the inland, than either by the importation or exportation trade.</P>
<P>THE proportion of the average quantity of all &s;orts of grain imported into Great Britain to that of all &s;orts of grain con&s;umed, it has been computed by the author of the tracts upon the corn trade, does not exceed that of one to five hundred and &s;eventy. For &s;upplying the home market, therefore, the importance of the inland trade mu&s;t be to that of the importation trade as five hun|dred and &s;eventy to one.</P>
<P>THE average quantity of all &s;orts of grain exported from Great Britain does not, according to the &s;ame author, exceed the one and thirtieth part of the annual produce. For the encouragement of tillage, therefore, by providing a market for the home produce, the importance of the inland trade mu&s;t be to that of the exportation trade as thirty to one.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="124">
I HAVE no great faith in political arithmetick, and I mean not to warrant the exactne&s;s of either of the&s;e computations.

<P N="2">II. THE trade of the merchant importer of foreign corn for home con&s;umption, evidently contributes to the immediate &s;upply of the home market, and mu&s;t &s;o far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the people. It tends, indeed, to lower &s;omewhat the average money price of corn, but not to dimini&s;h its real value, or the quantity of labour which it is capable of maintaining. If importation was at all times free, our farmers and country gentle|men would, probably, one year with another, get le&s;s money for their corn than they do at pre&s;ent, when importation is at mo&s;t times in effect prohibited; but the money which they got would be of more value, would buy more goods of all other kinds, and would employ more labour. Their real wealth, their real revenue, therefore, would be the &s;ame as at pre&s;ent, though it might be expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;maller quantity of &s;ilver; and they would neither be di&s;abled nor di&s;couraged from cultivating corn as much as they do at pre&s;ent. On the contrary, as the ri&s;e in the real value of &s;il|ver, in con&s;equence of lowering the money price of corn, lowers &s;omewhat the money price of all other commodities, it gives the
<PB N="122" REF="125">
indu&s;try of the country where it takes place &s;ome advantage in all foreign markets, and thereby tends to encourage and increa&s;e that indu&s;try. But the extent of the home market for corn mu&s;t be in proportion to the general indu&s;try of the country where it grows, or to the number of tho&s;e who produce &s;omething el&s;e, and there|fore have &s;omething el&s;e, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of &s;omething el&s;e, to give in exchange for corn. But in every country the home market, as it is the neare&s;t and mo&s;t conve|nient, &s;o is it likewi&s;e the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important market for corn. That ri&s;e in the real value of &s;ilver, therefore, which is the effect of lowering the average money price of corn, tends to en|large the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important market for corn, and thereby to encourage, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging, its growth.</P>
<P>BY the 22d of Charles II. c. 13. the importation of wheat, whenever the price in the home market did not exceed fifty-three &s;hillings and four pence the quarter, was &s;ubjected to a duty of &s;ixteen &s;hillings the quarter; and to a duty of eight &s;hillings whenever the price did not exceed four pounds. The former of the&s;e two prices has, for more than a century pa&s;t, taken place only in times of very great &s;carcity; and the latter has, &s;o far as I know, not taken place at all. Yet, till wheat had ri&s;en above this latter price, it was by this &s;tatute &s;ubjected to a very high duty; and, till it had ri&s;en above the former, to a duty which amounted to a prohibition. The importation of other &s;orts of grain was re&s;trained by duties proportionably high.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;s which, in years of &s;carcity, the &s;trict execution of this &s;tatute might have brought upon the people, would probably have been very great. But, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, its execution was generally &s;u&s;pended by temporary &s;tatutes, which permitted, for a limited time, the importation of foreign corn. The nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="123" REF="126">
the&s;e temporary &s;tatutes &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates the impropriety of this general one.</P>
<P>THESE re&s;traints upon importation, though prior to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the bounty, were dictated by the &s;ame &s;pirit, by the &s;ame principles, which afterwards enacted that regulation. How hurtful &s;oever in them&s;elves, the&s;e or &s;ome other re&s;traints upon importation became nece&s;&s;ary in con&s;equence of that regulation. If, when wheat was either below forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, or not much above it, foreign corn could have been imported either duty free, or upon paying only a &s;mall duty, it might have been exported again, with the benefit of the bounty, to the great lo&s;s of the publick revenue, and to the intire perver&s;ion of the in&s;titution, of which the object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that for the growth of foreign countries.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE trade of the merchant exporter of corn for foreign con&s;umption, certainly does not contribute directly to the plen|tiful &s;upply of the home market. It does &s;o, however, indirectly. From whatever &s;ource this &s;upply may be u&s;ually drawn, whether from home growth or from foreign importation, unle&s;s more corn is either u&s;ually grown, or u&s;ually imported into the country, than what is u&s;ually con&s;umed in it, the &s;upply of the home market can never be very plentiful. But, unle&s;s the &s;urplus can, in all ordinary ca&s;es, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow more, and the importers never to import more, than what the bare con&s;umption of the home market requires. That market will very &s;eldom be over&s;tocked; but it will generally be under|&s;tocked, the people, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;upply it, being gene|rally afraid le&s;t their goods &s;hould be left upon their hands. The prohibition of exportation limits the improvement and culti|vation of the country to what the &s;upply of its own inhabitants
<PB N="124" REF="127">
requires. The freedom of exportation enables it to extend its cul|tivation for the &s;upply of foreign nations.</P>
<P>BY the 12th of Charles II. c. 4. the exportation of corn was permitted whenever the price of wheat did not exceed forty &s;hil|lings the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion. By the 15th of the &s;ame prince this liberty was extended till the price of wheat exceeded forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter; and by the 22d, to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed, was to be paid to the king upon &s;uch exportation. But all grain was rated &s;o low in the book of rates, that this poundage amounted only upon wheat to a &s;hilling, upon oats to four-pence, and upon all other grain to &s;ixpence the quarter. By the 1&s;t of William and Mary, the act which e&s;tabli&s;hed the bounty, this &s;mall duty was virtually taken off whenever the price of wheat did not exceed forty-eight &s;hil|lings the quarter; and by the 11th and 12th of William III. c. 20. it was expre&s;sly taken off at all higher prices.</P>
<P>THE trade of the merchant exporter was in this manner, not only encouraged by a bounty, but rendered much more free than that of the inland dealer. By the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes, corn could be engro&s;&s;ed at any price for exportation; but it could not be en|gro&s;&s;ed for inland &s;ale, except when the price did not exceed forty|eight &s;hillings the quarter. The intere&s;t of the inland dealer, how|ever, it has already been &s;hown, can never be oppo&s;ite to that of the great body of the people. That of the merchant exporter may, and in fact &s;ometimes is. If, while his own country labours under a dearth, a neighbouring country &s;hould be afflicted with a famine, it might be his intere&s;t to carry corn to the latter country in &s;uch quantities as might very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth. The plentiful &s;upply of the home market was not the direct object of tho&s;e &s;tatutes; but, under the pretence of encou|raging
<PB N="125" REF="128">
agriculture, to rai&s;e the money price of corn as high as po&s;|&s;ible, and thereby to occa&s;ion, as much as po&s;&s;ible, a con&s;tant dearth in the home market. By the di&s;couragement of importa|tion, the &s;upply of that market, even in times of great &s;carcity, was confined to the home growth; and by the encouragement of exportation, when the price was &s;o high as forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, that market was not, even in times of con&s;iderable &s;car|city, allowed to enjoy the whole of that growth. The temporary laws, prohibiting for a limited time the exportation of corn, and taking off for a limited time the duties upon its importation, expe|dients to which Great Britain has been obliged &s;o frequently to have recour&s;e, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the impropriety of her general &s;y&s;tem. Had that &s;y&s;tem been good, &s;he would not &s;o frequently have been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of departing from it.</P>
<P>WERE all nations to follow the liberal &s;y&s;tem of free exporta|tion and free importation, the different &s;tates into which a great continent was divided would &s;o far re&s;emble the different provinces of a great empire. As among the different provinces of a great empire the freedom of the inland trade appears, both from rea&s;on and experience, not only the be&s;t palliative of a dearth, but the mo&s;t effectual preventative of a famine; &s;o would the freedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the different &s;tates into which a great continent was divided. The larger the conti|nent, the ea&s;ier the communication through all the different parts of it, both by land and by water, the le&s;s would any one particu|lar part of it ever be expo&s;ed to either of the&s;e calamities, the &s;carcity of any one country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of &s;ome other. But very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal &s;y&s;tem. The freedom of the corn trade is almo&s;t every where more or le&s;s re&s;trained, and, in many countries, is confined by &s;uch ab&s;urd regulations, as frequently aggravate the unavoidable misfortune of a dearth into the dreadful calamity of a famine.
<PB N="126" REF="129">
The demand of &s;uch countries for corn may frequently become &s;o great and &s;o urgent, that a &s;mall &s;tate in their neighbourhood, which happened at the &s;ame time to be labouring under &s;ome de|gree of dearth, could not venture to &s;upply them without expo&s;ing it&s;elf to the like dreadful calamity. The very bad policy of one country may thus render it in &s;ome mea&s;ure dangerous and impru|dent to e&s;tabli&s;h what would otherwi&s;e be the be&s;t policy in ano|ther. The unlimited freedom of exportation, however, would be much le&s;s dangerous in great &s;tates, in which the growth being much greater, the &s;upply could &s;eldom be much affected by any quantity of corn that was likely to be exported. In a Swi&s;s can|ton, or in &s;ome of the little &s;tates of Italy, it may, perhaps, &s;ome|times be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the exportation of corn. In &s;uch great countries as France or England it &s;carce ever can. To hin|der, be&s;ides, the farmer from &s;ending his goods at all times to the be&s;t market, is evidently to &s;acrifice the ordinary laws of ju&s;tice to an idea of public utility, to a &s;ort of rea&s;ons of &s;tate; an act of legi|&s;lative authority which ought to be exerci&s;ed only, which can be pardoned only in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity. The price at which the exportation of corn is prohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited, ought always to be a very high price.</P>
<P>THE laws concerning corn may every where be compared to the laws concerning religion. The people feel them&s;elves &s;o much inte|re&s;ted in what relates either to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in this life, or to their happine&s;s in a life to come, that government mu&s;t yield to their prejudices, and, in order to pre&s;erve the public tranquillity, e&s;ta|bli&s;h that &s;y&s;tem which they approve of. It is upon this account, perhaps, that we &s;o &s;eldom find a rea&s;onable &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed with regard to either of tho&s;e two capital objects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE trade of the merchant carrier, or of the importer of foreign corn, in order to export it again, contributes to the
<PB N="127" REF="130">
plentiful &s;upply of the home market. It is not indeed the direct purpo&s;e of his trade to &s;ell his corn there. But he will generally be willing to do &s;o, and even for a good deal le&s;s money than he might expect in a foreign market; becau&s;e he &s;aves in this manner the expence of loading and unloading, of freight and in&s;urance. The inhabitants of the country which, by means of the carrying trade, becomes the magazine and &s;torehou&s;e for the &s;upply of other countries, can very &s;eldom be in want them|&s;elves. Though the carrying trade might thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in the home market, it would not thereby lower its real value. It would only rai&s;e &s;ome|what the real value of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THE carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain upon all ordinary occa&s;ions, by the high duties upon the im|portation of foreign corn; and upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, when a &s;carcity made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;pend tho&s;e duties by tem|porary &s;tatutes, exportation was always prohibited. By this &s;y&s;tem of laws, therefore, the carrying trade was in effect prohibited upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THAT &s;y&s;tem of laws, therefore, which is connected with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bounty, &s;eems to de&s;erve no part of the prai&s;e which has been be&s;towed upon it. The improvement and pro&s;perity of Great Britain, which has been &s;o often a&s;cribed to tho&s;e laws, may very ea&s;ily be accounted for by other cau&s;es. That &s;ecurity which the laws in Great Britain give to every man that he &s;hall enjoy the fruits of his own labour, is alone &s;ufficient to make any country flouri&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and twenty other ab&s;urd regulations of commerce; and this &s;ecurity was perfected by the revolution, much about the &s;ame time that the bounty was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The natural effort of every individual
<PB N="128" REF="131">
to better his own condition, when &s;uffered to exert it&s;elf with freedom and &s;ecurity, is &s;o powerful a principle that it is alone, and without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not only capable of carrying on the &s;ociety to wealth and pro&s;perity, but of &s;urmounting a hundred impertinent ob&s;tructions with which the folly of human laws too often incumbers its operations; though the effect of the&s;e ob|&s;tructions is always more or le&s;s either to encroach upon its free|dom, or to dimini&s;h its &s;ecurity. In Great Britain indu&s;try is perfectly &s;ecure; and though it is far from being perfectly free, it is as free or freer than in any other part of Europe.</P>
<P>THOUGH the period of the greate&s;t pro&s;perity and improve|ment of Great Britain, has been po&s;terior to that &s;y&s;tem of laws which is connected with the bounty, we mu&s;t not upon that account impute it to tho&s;e laws. It has been po&s;terior likewi&s;e to the national debt. But the national debt has mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly not been the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;y&s;tem of laws which is connected with the bounty, has exactly the &s;ame tendency with the police of Spain and Portugal; to lower &s;omewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it takes place; yet Great Britain is certainly one of the riche&s;t countries in Europe, while Spain and Portugal are perhaps among the mo&s;t beggarly. This difference of &s;ituation, however, may ea&s;ily be accounted for from two dif|ferent cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, the tax in Spain, the prohibition in Portu|gal of exporting gold and &s;ilver, and the vigilant police which watches over the execution of tho&s;e laws, mu&s;t, in two very poor countries, which between them import annually upwards of &s;ix millions &s;terling, operate, not only more directly, but much more forcibly in reducing the value of tho&s;e metals there, than the corn laws can do in Great Britain. And, &s;econdly, this bad policy is not in tho&s;e countries counter-balanced by the general
<PB N="129" REF="132">
liberty and &s;ecurity of the people. Indu&s;try is there neither free nor &s;ecure, and the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical governments of both Spain and Portugal, are &s;uch as would alone be &s;ufficient to per|petuate their pre&s;ent &s;tate of poverty, even though their regula|tions of commerce were as wi&s;e as the greater part of them are ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE 13th of the pre&s;ent king, c. 43. &s;eems to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a new &s;y&s;tem with regard to the corn laws, in many re&s;pects better than the ancient one, but in one re&s;pect perhaps not quite &s;o good.</P>
<P>BY this &s;tatute the high duties upon importation for home con&s;umption are taken off as &s;oon as the price of wheat is &s;o high as forty-eight &s;hillings the quarter, and in&s;tead of them a &s;mall duty is impo&s;ed of only &s;ixpence upon the quarter of wheat, and upon that of other grain in proportion. The home market is in this manner not &s;o totally excluded from foreign &s;upplies as it was before.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame &s;tatute the old bounty of five &s;hillings upon the quarter of wheat cea&s;es when the price ri&s;es &s;o high as forty|four &s;hillings, and upon that of other grain in proportion. The bounties too upon the coar&s;er &s;orts of grain are reduced &s;ome|what lower than they were before, even at the prices at which they take place. If bounties are as improper as I have en|deavoured to prove them to be, the &s;ooner they cea&s;e and the lower they are, &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;tatute permits at all prices the importation of corn in order to be exported again, duty free; provided it is in the meantime lodged in the king's warehou&s;e. This liberty indeed extends to no more than twenty-five of the different ports of
<PB N="130" REF="133">
Great Britain. They are, however, the principal ones, and there may not perhaps be warehou&s;es proper for this purpo&s;e in the greater part of the others. Some provi&s;ion is thus made for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the carrying trade.</P>
<P>So far this law &s;eems evidently an improvement upon the antient &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>BUT by the &s;ame law exportation is prohibited as &s;oon as the price of wheat ri&s;es to forty-four &s;hillings the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion. The price &s;eems to be a good deal too low, and there &s;eems to be an impropriety be&s;ides in &s;topping ex|portation altogether, at the very &s;ame price at which that bounty which was given in order to force it, is withdrawn. The bounty ought certainly either to have been withdrawn at a much lower price, or exportation ought to have been allowed at a much higher. So far, therefore, this law &s;eems to be inferior to the ancient &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of treaties of commerce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN a nation binds it&s;elf by treaty either to permit the entry of certain goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others, or to exempt the goods of one coun|try from duties to which it &s;ubjects tho&s;e of all others, the country, or at lea&s;t the merchants and manufacturers of the country, who&s;e commerce is &s;o favoured, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily derive
<PB N="131" REF="134">
great advantage from the treaty. Tho&s;e merchants and manufac|turers enjoy a &s;ort of monopoly in the country which is &s;o indul|gent to them. That country becomes a market both more ex|ten&s;ive and more advantageous for their goods: more exten&s;ive, becau&s;e the goods of other nations being either excluded or &s;ub|jected to heavier duties, it takes off a greater quantity of theirs: more advantageous, becau&s;e the merchants of the favoured coun|try, enjoying a &s;ort of monopoly there, will often &s;ell their goods for a better price than if expo&s;ed to the free competition of all other nations.</P>
<P>SUCH treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the merchants and manufacturers of the favoured, are nece&s;&s;arily di&s;advantageous to tho&s;e of the favouring country. A monopoly is thus granted again&s;t them to a foreign nation; and they mu&s;t frequently buy the foreign goods they have occa&s;ion for dearer than if the free competition of other nations was admitted. That part of its own produce with which &s;uch a nation purcha&s;es foreign goods, mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;old cheaper, becau&s;e when two things are ex|changed for one another, the cheapne&s;s of the one is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, or rather is the &s;ame thing with the dearne&s;s of the other. The exchangeable value of its annual produce, therefore, is likely to be dimini&s;hed by every &s;uch treaty. This diminution, however, can &s;carce amount to any po&s;itive lo&s;s, but only to a le&s;&s;ening of the gain which it might otherwi&s;e make. Though it &s;ells its goods cheaper than it otherwi&s;e might do, it will not probably &s;ell them for le&s;s than they co&s;t; nor, as in the ca&s;e of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital employed in bringing them to market, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock. The trade could not go on long if it did. Even the favouring coun|try, therefore, may &s;till gain by the trade, though le&s;s than if there was a free competition.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135">
SOME treaties of commerce, however, have been &s;uppo&s;ed ad|vantageous upon principles very different from the&s;e; and a com|mercial country has &s;ometimes granted a monopoly of this kind again&s;t it&s;elf to certain goods of a foreign nation, becau&s;e it expected that in the whole commerce between them, it would annually &s;ell more than it would buy, and that a balance in gold and &s;ilver would be annually returned to it. It is upon this principle that the treaty of commerce between England and Por|tugal, concluded in 1703 by Mr. Methuen, has been &s;o much commended. The following is a literal tran&s;lation of that treaty, which con&s;i&s;ts of three articles only.</P>

<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<P>THAT is to &s;ay, that her &s;acred royal maje&s;ty of Great Britain &s;hall, in her own name, and that of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, be obliged for ever hereafter, to admit the wines of the growth of Portu|gal into Britain; &s;o that at no time, whether there &s;hall be peace or war between the kingdoms of Britain and France, any thing more &s;hall be demanded for the&s;e wines by the name of cu&s;tom or duty, or by what&s;oever other title, directly or indirectly, whe|ther they &s;hall be imported into Great Britain in pipes or hog&s;|heads, or other ca&s;ks, than what &s;hall be demanded for the like quantity or mea&s;ure of French wine, deducting or abating a third|part of the cu&s;tom or duty.

<P>THE mo&s;t excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promi&s;e and take upon them&s;elves, that their above-named ma&s;ters &s;hall ratify this treaty, and within the &s;pace of two months, the ratifications &s;hall be exchanged.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>BY this treaty the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the Engli&s;h woollens upon the &s;ame footing as before the prohi|bition, that is, not to rai&s;e the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does not become bound to admit them upon any better terms than tho&s;e of any other nation, of France or Holland, for example. The crown of Great Britain, on the contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal, upon paying only two-thirds of the duty, which is paid for tho&s;e of France, the wines mo&s;t likely to come into competition with them. So far this treaty, therefore, is evidently advantageous to Portu|gal, and di&s;advantageous to Great Britain.</P>
<P>IT has been celebrated, however, as a ma&s;ter-piece of the commercial policy of England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater quantity of gold than can be employed in its dome&s;tick commerce, whether in the &s;hape of coin or of plate. The &s;urplus is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle and locked up in coffers, and as it can find no advantageous market at home, it mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding any prohibition, be &s;ent abroad and exchanged for &s;omething for which there is a more advan|tageous market at home. A large &s;hare of it comes annually to England, in return either for Engli&s;h goods, or for tho&s;e of other
<PB N="134" REF="137">
European nations that receive their returns through England. Mr. Baretti was informed that the weekly packet-boat from Li&s;bon brings, one week with another, more than fifty thou&s;and pounds in gold to England. The &s;um had probably been exag|gerated. It would amount to more than two millions &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year, which is more than the Brazils are &s;uppo&s;ed to afford.</P>
<P>OUR merchants were &s;ome years ago out of humour with the crown of Portugal. Some privileges which had been granted them, not by treaty, but by the free grace of that crown, at the &s;olicitation, indeed, it is probable, and in return for much greater favours, defence and protection, from the crown of Great Britain, had been either infringed or revoked. The people, therefore, u&s;ually mo&s;t intere&s;ted in celebrating the Portugal trade, were then rather di&s;po&s;ed to repre&s;ent it as le&s;s advantageous than it had commonly been imagined. The far greater part, almo&s;t the whole, they pretended, of this annual importation of gold, was not on account of Great Britain, but of other European nations; the fruits and wines of Portugal annually imported into Great Britain nearly compen&s;ating the value of the Briti&s;h goods &s;ent thither.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e, however, that the whole was on account of Great Britain, and that it amounted to a &s;till greater &s;um than Mr. Baretti &s;eems to imagine: this trade would not, upon that account, be more advantageous than any other in which for the &s;ame value &s;ent out, we received an equal value of con&s;um|able goods in return.</P>
<P>IT is but a very &s;mall part of this importation which, it can be &s;uppo&s;ed, is employed as an annual addition either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom. The re&s;t mu&s;t all be &s;ent abroad and

exchanged for con&s;umable goods of &s;ome kind or other. But if tho&s;e con&s;umable goods were purcha&s;ed directly with the produce of Engli&s;h indu&s;try, it would be more for the advantage of England than fir&s;t to purcha&s;e with that produce the gold of Portugal, and afterwards to purcha&s;e with that gold tho&s;e con&s;umable goods. A direct foreign trade of con&s;umption is always more advantageous than a round-about one; and to bring the &s;ame value of foreign goods to the home market, requires a much &s;maller capital in the one than in the other. If a &s;maller &s;hare of its indu&s;try, there|fore, had been employed in producing goods fit for the Portugal market, and a greater in producing tho&s;e fit for the other markets where tho&s;e con&s;umable goods for which there is a demand in Great Britain are to be had, it would have been more for the advantage of England. To procure both the gold, which it wants for its own u&s;e, and the con&s;umable goods, would, in this way, employ a much &s;maller capital than at pre&s;ent. There would be a &s;pare capital, therefore, to be employed for other purpo&s;es, in exciting an additional quantity of indu&s;try, and in rai&s;ing a greater annual produce.</P>
<P>THOUGH Britain were entirely excluded from the Portugal trade, it could find very little difficulty in procuring all the annual &s;up|plies of gold which it wants, either for the purpo&s;es of plate, or of coin, or of foreign trade. Gold, like every other commodity, is always &s;omewhere or another to be got for its value by tho&s;e who have that value to give for it. The annual &s;urplus of gold in Por|tugal, be&s;ides, would &s;till be &s;ent abroad, and, though not carried away by Great Britain, would be carried away by &s;ome other nation, which would be glad to &s;ell it again for its price, in the &s;ame man|ner as Great Britain does at pre&s;ent. In buying gold of Portu|gal, indeed, we buy it at the fir&s;t hand; whereas, in buying it of any other nation, except Spain, we &s;hould buy it at the &s;econd,
<PB N="136" REF="139">
and might pay &s;omewhat dearer. This difference, however, would &s;urely be too in&s;ignificant to de&s;erve the publick attention.</P>
<P>ALMOST all our gold, it is &s;aid, comes from Portugal. With other nations the balance of trade is either again&s;t us, or not much in our favour. But we &s;hould remember, that the more gold we import from one country, the le&s;s we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily import from all others. The effectual demand for gold, like that for every other commodity, is in every country limited to a certain quan|tity. If nine-tenths of this quantity are imported from one coun|try, there remains a tenth only to be imported from all others. The more gold be&s;ides that is annually imported from &s;ome parti|cular countries, over and above what is requi&s;ite for plate and for coin, the more mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be exported to &s;ome others; and the more, that mo&s;t in&s;ignificant object of modern policy, the ba|lance of trade, appears to be in our favour with &s;ome particular countries, the more it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear to be again&s;t us with many others.</P>
<P>IT was upon this &s;illy notion, however, that England could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war, France and Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation, required the king of Portugal to exclude all Bri|ti&s;h &s;hips from his ports, and for the &s;ecurity of this exclu&s;ion, to receive into them French or Spani&s;h garri&s;ons. Had the king of Portugal &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e ignominious terms which his brother-in-law the king of Spain propo&s;ed to him, Britain would have been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the lo&s;s of the Portugal trade, the burden of &s;upporting a very weak ally, &s;o unprovided of every thing for his own defence, that the whole power of England, had it been directed to that &s;ingle purpo&s;e, could &s;carce perhaps have defended him for another
<PB N="137" REF="140">
campaign. The lo&s;s of the Portugal trade would, no doubt, have occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable embarra&s;&s;ment to the merchants at that time engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a year or two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their capitals; and in this would probably have con&s;i&s;ted all the inconveniency which England could have &s;uffered from this notable piece of commercial policy.</P>
<P>THE great annual importation of gold and &s;ilver is neither for the purpo&s;e of plate nor of coin, but of foreign trade. A round|about foreign trade of con&s;umption can be carried on more advan|tageou&s;ly by means of the&s;e metals than of almo&s;t any other goods. As they are the univer&s;al in&s;truments of commerce, they are more readily received in return for all commodities than any other goods; and on account of their &s;mall bulk and great value, it co&s;ts le&s;s to tran&s;port them backward and forwards from one place to another than almo&s;t any other &s;ort of merchandize, and they lo&s;e le&s;s of their value by being &s;o tran&s;ported. Of all the commodities, therefore, which are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpo&s;e but to be &s;old or exchanged again for &s;ome other goods in another, there are none &s;o convenient as gold and &s;ilver. In facilitating all the different round-about foreign trades of con&s;umption which are carried on in Great Britain, con&s;i&s;ts the principal advantage of the Portugal trade; and though it is not a capital advantage, it is, no doubt, a con&s;iderable one.</P>
<P>THAT any annual addition which, it can rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed, is made either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom, could require but a very &s;mall annual importation of gold and &s;ilver, &s;eems evident enough; and, though we had no direct trade with Portugal, this &s;mall quantity could always, &s;omewhere or another, be very ea&s;ily got.</P>
<P>THOUGH the gold&s;miths trade be very con&s;iderable in Great Bri|tain, the far greater part of the new plate which they annually
<PB N="138" REF="141">
&s;ell, is made from other old plate melted down; &s;o that the addi|tion annually made to the whole plate of the kingdom cannot be very great, and could require but a very &s;mall annual importation.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame ca&s;e with the coin. Nobody imagines, I believe, that even the greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together before the late reformation of the gold coin, to up|wards of eight hundred thou&s;and pounds a year in gold, was an annual addition to the money before current in the kingdom. In a country where the expence of the coinage is defrayed by the govern|ment, the value of the coin, even when it contains its full &s;tandard weight of gold and &s;ilver, can never be much greater than that of an equal quantity of tho&s;e metals uncoined; becau&s;e it requires only the trouble of going to the mint, and the delay perhaps of a few weeks, to procure for any quantity of uncoined gold and &s;ilver an equal quantity of tho&s;e metals in coin. But, in every country, the greater part of the current coin is almo&s;t always more or le&s;s worn, or otherwi&s;e degenerated from its &s;tandard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a good deal &s;o, the gold being more than two per cent. and the &s;ilver more than eight per cent. below its &s;tand|ard weight. But if forty-four guineas and a half, containing their full &s;tandard weight, a pound weight of gold, could purcha&s;e very little more than a pound weight of uncoined gold, forty-four guineas and a half wanting a part of their weight could not pur|cha&s;e a pound weight, and &s;omething was to be added in order to make up the deficiency. The current price of gold bullion at market, therefore, in&s;tead of being the &s;ame with the mint price, or 461. 14s. 6d. was then about 471. 14s. and &s;ometimes about forty|eight pounds. When the greater part of the coin, however, was in this degenerate condition, forty-four guineas and a half, fre&s;h from the mint, would purcha&s;e no more goods in the market than any other ordinary guineas, becau&s;e when they come into the cof|fers of the merchant, being confounded with other money, they
<PB N="139" REF="142">
could not afterwards be di&s;tingui&s;hed without more trouble than the difference was worth. Like other guineas they were worth no more than 461. 14s. 6d. If thrown into the melting pot, how|ever, they produced, without any &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s, a pound weight of &s;tandard gold, which could be &s;old at any time for between 471. 14s. and 481. either in gold or &s;ilver, as fit for all the purpo&s;es of coin as that which had been melted down. There was an evident pro|fit, therefore, in melting down new coined money, and it was done &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, that no precaution of government could prevent it. The operations of the mint were, upon this account, &s;omewhat like the web of Penelope; the work that was done in the day was undone in the night. The mint was employed, not &s;o much in making daily additions to the coin, as in replacing the very be&s;t part of it which was daily melted down.</P>
<P>WERE the private people, who carry their gold and &s;ilver to the mint, to pay them&s;elves for the coinage, it would add to the value of tho&s;e metals in the &s;ame manner as the fa&s;hion does to that of plate. Coined gold and &s;ilver would be more valuable than uncoined. The &s;eignorage, if it was not exorbitant, would add to the bullion the whole value of the duty; becau&s;e, the government having every where the exclu&s;ive privilege of coining, no coin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it. If the duty was exorbitant indeed, that is, if it was very much above the real value of the labour and expence requi&s;ite for coinage, fal&s;e coiners, both at home and abroad, might be encouraged, by the great difference between the value of bullion and that of coin, to pour in &s;o great a quantity of counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government money. In France, however, though the &s;eignorage is eight per cent. no &s;en&s;ible inconveniency of this kind is found to ari&s;e from it. The dangers to which a fal&s;e coiner is every where expo&s;ed, if he lives in the country of which he coun|terfeits
<PB N="140" REF="143">
the coin, and to which his agents or corre&s;pondents are expo&s;ed if he lives in a foreign country, are by far too great to be incurred for the &s;ake of a profit of &s;ix or &s;even per cent.</P>
<P>THE &s;eignorage in France rai&s;es the value of the coin higher than in proportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus by the edict of January, 1726, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dictionaire des Monnoies, tom. i. article Seigneurage, p. 489. par M. Abot de Bazinghen, Con&s;eiller-Comi&s;&s;aire en la Cour des Monnoies &agrave; Paris.</NOTE> the mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats was fixed at &s;even hundred and forty livres, nine &s;ous and one denier one-eleventh, the mark of eight Paris ounces. The gold coin of France, making an allowance for the remedy of the mint, contains twenty-one carats and three-fourths of fine gold, and two carats one-fourth of alloy. The mark of &s;tandard gold, therefore, is worth no more than about &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-one livres ten deniers. But in France this mark of &s;tandard gold is coined into thirty Louis d' ors of twenty-four livres each, or into &s;even hundred and twenty livres. The coinage, therefore, increa&s;es the value of a mark of &s;tandard gold bullion, by the difference between &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-one livres ten deniers and &s;even hundred and twenty livres; or by forty-eight livres, nineteen &s;ous, and two deniers.</P>
<P>A SEIGNORAGE will, in many ca&s;es, take away altogether, and will, in all ca&s;es, dimini&s;h the profit of melting down the new coin. This profit always ari&s;es from the difference between the quan|tity of bullion which the common currency ought to contain, and that which it actually does contain. If this difference is le&s;s than the &s;eignorage, there will be lo&s;s in&s;tead of profit. If it is equal to the &s;eignorage, there will neither be profit nor lo&s;s. If it is greater than the &s;eignorage, there will indeed be &s;ome profit, but
<PB N="141" REF="144">
le&s;s than if there was no &s;eignorage. If, before the late reforma|tion of the gold coin, for example, there had been a &s;eignorage of five per cent. upon the coinage, there would have been a lo&s;s of three per cent. upon the melting down of the gold coin. If the &s;eignorage had been two per cent. there would have been neither profit nor lo&s;s. If the &s;eignorage had been one per cent. there would have been a profit, but of one per cent. only in&s;tead of two per cent. Wherever money is received by tale, therefore, and not by weight, a &s;eignorage is the mo&s;t effectual preventative of the melting down of the coin, and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, of its expor|tation. It is the be&s;t and heavie&s;t pieces that are commonly either melted down or exported; becau&s;e it is upon &s;uch that the large&s;t profits are made.</P>
<P>THE law for the encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free, was fir&s;t enacted, during the reign of Charles II. for a limited time; and afterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was rendered perpetual. The bank of England, in order to repleni&s;h their coffers with money, are fre|quently obliged to carry bullion to the mint; and it was more for their intere&s;t, they probably imagined, that the coinage &s;hould be at the expence of the government, than at their own. It was, probably, out of complai&s;ance to this great company that the go|vernment agreed to render this law perpetual. Should the cu&s;tom of weighing gold, however, come to be difu&s;ed, as it is very likely to be on account of its inconveniency; &s;hould the gold coin of England come to be received by tale, as it was before the late re|coinage, this great company may, perhaps, find that they have upon this, as upon &s;ome other occa&s;ions, mi&s;taken their own inte|re&s;t not a little.</P>
<P>BEFORE the late re-coinage, when the gold currency of Eng|land was two per cent. below its &s;tandard weight, as there was
<PB N="142" REF="145">
no &s;eignorage, it was two per cent. below the value of that quantity of &s;tandard gold bullion which it ought to have con|tained. When this great company, therefore, bought gold bul|lion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it two per cent. more than it was worth after the coinage. But if there had been a &s;eignorage of two per cent. upon the coinage, the common gold currency, though two per cent. below its &s;tand|ard weight, would notwith&s;tanding have been equal in value to the quantity of &s;tandard gold which it ought to have contained; the value of the fa&s;hion compen&s;ating in this ca&s;e the diminution of the weight. They would indeed have had the &s;eignorage to pay, which being two per cent. their lo&s;s upon the whole tran&s;|action would have been two per cent. exactly the &s;ame, but no greater than it actually was.</P>
<P>IF the &s;eignorage had been five per cent. and the gold cur|rency only two per cent. below its &s;tandard weight, the bank would in this ca&s;e have gained three per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would have had a &s;eignorage of five per cent. to pay upon the coinage, their lo&s;s upon the whole tran&s;ac|tion would, in the &s;ame manner, have been exactly two per cent.</P>
<P>In the &s;eignorage had been only one per cent. and the gold currency two per cent. below its &s;tandard weight, the bank would in this ca&s;e have lo&s;t only one per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would likewi&s;e have had a &s;eignorage of one per cent. to pay, their lo&s;s upon the whole tran&s;action would have been exactly two per cent. in the &s;ame manner as in all other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IF there was a rea&s;onable &s;eignorage, while at the &s;ame time the coin contained its full &s;tandard weight, as it has done very
<PB N="143" REF="146">
nearly &s;ince the late re-coinage, whatever the bank might lo&s;e by the &s;eignorage, they would gain upon the price of the bullion; and whatever they might gain upon the price of the bullion, they would lo&s;e by the &s;eignorage. They would neither lo&s;e nor gain, therefore, upon the whole tran&s;action, and they would in this, as in all the foregoing ca&s;es, be exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation as if there was no &s;eignorage.</P>
<P>WHEN the tax upon a commodity is &s;o moderate as not to encourage &s;muggling, the merchant, who deals in it, though he advances, does not properly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity. The tax is finally paid by the la&s;t purcha&s;er or con&s;umer. But money is a commodity with regard to which every man is a merchant. Nobody buys it but in order to &s;ell it again; and with regard to it there is in ordinary ca&s;es no la&s;t purcha&s;er or con&s;umer. When the tax upon coin|age, therefore, is &s;o moderate as not to encourage fal&s;e coin|ing, though every body advances the tax, nobody finally pays it; becau&s;e every body gets it back in the advanced value of the coin.</P>
<P>A MODERATE &s;eignorage, therefore, would not in any ca&s;e augment the expence of the bank, or of any other private per|&s;ons who carry their bullion to the mint in order to be coined, and the want of a moderate &s;eignorage does not in any ca&s;e dimi|ni&s;h it. Whether there is or is not a &s;eignorage, if the currency contains its full &s;tandard weight, the coinage co&s;ts nothing to any body, and if it is &s;hort of that weight, the coinage mu&s;t always co&s;t the difference between the quantity of bullion which ought to be contained in it, and that which actually is con|tained in it.</P>
<P>THE government, therefore, when it defrays the expence of coinage, not only incurrs &s;ome &s;mall expence, but lo&s;es &s;ome
<PB N="144" REF="147">
&s;mall revenue which it might get by a proper duty; and neither the bank nor any other private per&s;ons are in the &s;malle&s;t degree benefited by this u&s;ele&s;s piece of public genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>THE directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to agree to the impo&s;ition of a &s;eignorage upon the authority of a &s;peculation which promi&s;es them no gain, but only pretends to in|&s;ure them from any lo&s;s. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the gold coin, and as long as it continues to be received by weight, they cer|tainly would gain nothing by &s;uch a change. But if the cu&s;tom of weighing the gold coin &s;hould ever go into difu&s;e, as it is very likely to do, and if the gold coin &s;hould ever fall into the &s;ame &s;tate of degradation in which it was before the late re-coinage, the gain, or more properly the &s;avings of the bank, in con&s;equence of the impo&s;ition of a &s;eignorage, would probably be very con&s;i|derable. The bank of England is the only company which &s;ends any con&s;iderable quantity of bullion to the mint, and the bur|den of the annual coinage falls entirely or almo&s;t entirely upon it. If this annual coinage had nothing to do but to repair the unavoidable lo&s;&s;es and nece&s;&s;ary tear and wear of the coin, it could &s;eldom exceed fifty thou&s;and or at mo&s;t a hundred thou&s;and pounds. But when the coin is degraded below its &s;tandard weight, the annual coinage mu&s;t, be&s;ides this, fill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting pot are continually making in the current coin. It was upon this account that dur|ing the ten or twelve years immediately preceeding the late refor|mation of the gold coin, the annual coinage amounted at an average to more than eight hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. But if there had been a &s;eignorage of four or five per cent. upon the gold coin, it would probably, even in the &s;tate in which things then were, have put an effectual &s;top to the bu&s;ine&s;s both of exportation and of the melting pot. The bank, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing
<PB N="145" REF="148">
every year about two and a half per cent. upon the bullion which was to be coined into more than eight hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, or incurring an annual lo&s;s of more than twenty one thou&s;and two hundred and fifty pounds, would not probably have incurred the tenth part of that lo&s;s.</P>
<P>THE revenue allotted by parliament for defraying the expence of the coinage is but fourteen thou&s;and pounds a year, and the real expence which it co&s;ts the government, or the fees of the officers of the mint, do not upon ordinary occa&s;ions, I am a&s;&s;ured, exceed the half of that &s;um. The &s;aving of &s;o very &s;mall a &s;um, or even the gaining of another which could not well be much larger, are objects too incon&s;iderable, it may be thought, to de&s;erve the &s;erious attention of government. But the &s;aving of eighteen or twenty thou&s;and pounds a year in ca&s;e of an event which is not improbable, which has frequently hap|pened before, and which is very likely to happen again, is &s;urely an object which well de&s;erves the &s;erious attention even of &s;o great a company as the bank of England.</P>
<P>SOME of the foregoing rea&s;onings and ob&s;ervations might per|haps have been more properly placed in tho&s;e chapters of the fir&s;t book which treat of the origin and u&s;e of money, and of the difference between the real and the nominal price of com|modities. But as the law for the encouragement of coinage de|rives its origin from tho&s;e vulgar prejudices which have been in|troduced by the mercantile &s;y&s;tem; I judged it more proper to re&s;erve them for this chapter. Nothing could be more agreeable to the &s;pirit of that &s;y&s;tem than a &s;ort of bounty upon the pro|duction of money, the very thing which, it &s;uppo&s;es, con&s;titutes the wealth of every nation. It is one of its many admirable ex|pedients for enriching the country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of Colonies.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART FIRST. <HI>Of the motives for e&s;tabli&s;hing new colonies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE intere&s;t which occa&s;ioned the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the different European colonies in America and the We&s;t Indies, was not altogether &s;o plain and di&s;tinct as that which directed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e of antient Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>ALL the different &s;tates of antient Greece po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, each of them, but a very &s;mall territory, and when the people in any one of them multiplied beyond what that territory could ea&s;ily main|tain, a part of them were &s;ent in que&s;t of a new habitation in &s;ome remote and di&s;tant part of the world; the warlike neigh|bours who &s;urrounded them on all &s;ides, rendering it difficult for any of them to enlarge very much its territory at home. The colonies of the Dorians re&s;orted chiefly to Italy and Sicily, which in the times preceeding the foundation of Rome, were inhabited by barbarous and uncivilized nations: tho&s;e of the Ionians and Eolians, the two other great tribes of the Greeks, to A&s;ia minor and the i&s;lands of the Egean &s;ea, of which the inhabitants &s;eem at that time to have been pretty much in the &s;ame &s;tate as tho&s;e of Sicily and Italy. The mother city, though &s;he con&s;idered the colony as a child, at all times entitled to great favour and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and owing in return much gratitude and re&s;pect, yet con|&s;idered it as an emancipated child over whom &s;he pretended to claim no direct authority or juri&s;diction. The colony &s;ettled its own form of government, enacted its own laws, elected its own magi|&s;trates, and made peace or war with its neighbours as an inde|pendant &s;tate which had no occa&s;ion to wait for the approbation
<PB N="147" REF="150">
or con&s;ent of the mother city. Nothing can be more plain and di&s;tinct than the intere&s;t which directed every &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>ROME, like mo&s;t of the other antient republicks, was originally founded upon an Agrarian law, which divided the publick territory in a certain proportion among the different citizens who compo&s;ed the &s;tate. The cour&s;e of human affairs, by marriage, by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, and by alienation, nece&s;&s;arily deranged this original divi|&s;ion, and frequently threw the lands, which had been allotted for the maintenance of many different families, into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle per&s;on. To remedy this di&s;order, for &s;uch it was &s;up|po&s;ed to be, a law was made, re&s;tricting the quantity of land which any citizen could po&s;&s;e&s;s to five hundred jugera, about three hundred and fifty Engli&s;h acres. This law, however, though we read of its having been executed upon one or two occa&s;ions, was either neglected or evaded, and the inequality of fortunes went on continually increa&s;ing. The greater part of the citizens had no land, and without it the manners and cu&s;toms of tho&s;e times ren|dered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his independancy. In the pre&s;ent times, though a poor man has no land of his own, if he has a little &s;tock, he may either farm the lands of another, or he may carry on &s;ome little retail trade; and if he has no &s;tock, he may find employment either as a country labourer, or as an artifi|cer. But, among the antient Romans, the lands of the rich were all cultivated by &s;laves, who wrought under an over&s;eer, who was likewi&s;e a &s;lave; &s;o that a poor freeman had little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as a labourer. All trades and manufactures too, even the retail trade, were carried on by the &s;laves of the rich for the benefit of their ma&s;ters, who&s;e wealth, authority and protection, made it difficult for a poor free|man to maintain the competition again&s;t them. The citizens, therefore, who had no land, had &s;carce any other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence
<PB N="148" REF="151">
but the bounties of the candidates at the annual elections. The tribunes, when they had a mind to animate the people again&s;t the rich and the great, put them in mind of the antient divi&s;ion of lands, and repre&s;ented that law which re&s;tricted this &s;ort of pri|vate property as the fundamental law of the republick. The peo|ple became clamorous to get land, and the rich and the great, we may believe, were perfectly determined not to give them any part of theirs. To &s;atisfy them in &s;ome mea&s;ure, therefore, they fre|quently propo&s;ed to &s;end out a new colony. But conquering Rome was, even upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, under no nece&s;&s;ity of turning out her citizens to &s;eek their fortune, if one may &s;ay &s;o, through the wide world, without knowing where they were to &s;ettle. She a&s;&s;igned them lands generally in the conquered provinces of Italy, where, being within the dominions of the republick, they could never form any independent &s;tate; but were at be&s;t but a &s;ort of corporation, which, though it had the power of enacting bye-laws for its own government, was at all times &s;ubject to the correction, juri&s;diction, and legi&s;lative authority of the mother city. The &s;ending out a colony of this kind, not only gave &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the people, but often e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of garri&s;on too in a newly conquered province, of which the obedience might other|wi&s;e have been doubtful. A Roman colony, therefore, whether we con&s;ider the nature of the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf, or the motives for making it, was altogether different from a Greek one. The words accordingly, which in the original languages denote tho&s;e different e&s;tabli&s;hments, have very different meanings. The latin word <HI>(Colonia)</HI> &s;ignifies &s;imply a plantation. The Greek word (<GAP DESC="foreign">) on the contrary, &s;ignifies a &s;eparation of dwelling, a departure from home, a going out of the hou&s;e. But, though the Roman colo|nies were in many re&s;pects different from the Greek ones, the inte|re&s;t which prompted to e&s;tabli&s;h them was equally plain and di|&s;tinct. Both in&s;titutions derived their origin either from irre&s;i&s;ta|ble nece&s;&s;ity, or from clear and evident utility.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="152">
THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of the European colonies in America and the We&s;t Indies aro&s;e from no nece&s;&s;ity; and though the utility which has re&s;ulted from them has been very great, it is not altogether &s;o clear and evident. It was not under&s;tood at their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and was not the motive either of that e&s;tabli&s;hment or of the di&s;coveries which gave occa&s;ion to it, and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility are not, perhaps, well under&s;tood at this day.</P>
<P>THE Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried on a very advantageous commerce in &s;piceries, and other Ea&s;t India goods, which they di&s;tributed among the other nations of Europe. They purcha&s;ed them in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the Mammeluks, the enemies of the Turks, of whom the Venetians were the enemies; and this union of intere&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the money of Venice, formed &s;uch a connection as gave the Venetians almo&s;t a monopoly of the trade.</P>
<P>THE great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Portugueze. They had been endeavouring, during the cour&s;e of the fifteenth century, to find out by &s;ea a way to the countries from which the Moors brought them ivory and gold du&s;t acro&s;s the De|&s;art. They di&s;covered the Madeiras, the Canaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, the coa&s;t of Guinea, that of Congo, Angola, and Loango, and, finally, the Cape of Good Hope. They had long wi&s;hed to &s;hare in the profitable traffic of the Venetians, and this la&s;t di&s;covery opened to them a probable pro&s;pect of doing &s;o. In 1497, Va&s;co de Gama &s;ailed from the port of Li&s;bon with a fleet of four &s;hips, and, after a navigation of eleven months, arrived upon the coa&s;t of Indo&s;tan, and thus compleated a cour&s;e of di&s;|coveries which had been pur&s;ued with great &s;teadine&s;s, and with very little interruption, for near a century together.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="153">
SOME years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in &s;u&s;pence about the projects of the Portugueze, of which the &s;ucce&s;s appeared yet to be doubtful, a Genoe&s;e pilot formed the yet more daring project of failing to the Ea&s;t Indies by the we&s;t. The &s;ituation of tho&s;e countries was at that time very imperfectly known in Europe. The few European travellers who had been there had magnified the di&s;tance; perhaps through &s;implicity and ignorance, what was really very great appearing almo&s;t infinite to tho&s;e who could not mea&s;ure it; or, perhaps, in order to increa&s;e &s;omewhat more the marvellous of their own adventures in vi&s;iting regions &s;o immen&s;ely remote from Europe. The longer the way was by the Ea&s;t, Columbus very ju&s;tly concluded, the &s;horter it would be by the We&s;t. He propo&s;ed, therefore, to take that way, as both the &s;horte&s;t and the &s;ure&s;t, and he had the good fortune to convince I&s;abella of Ca&s;tile of the probability of his project. He failed from the port of Palos in Augu&s;t 1492, near five years be|fore the expedition of Va&s;co de Gama &s;et out from Portugal, and, after a voyage of between two and three months, di&s;covered fir&s;t &s;ome of the &s;mall Bahama or Lucayan i&s;lands, and afterwards the great i&s;land of St. Domingo.</P>
<P>BUT the countries which Columbus di&s;covered, either in this or in any of his &s;ub&s;equent voyages, had no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e which he had gone in que&s;t of. In&s;tead of the wealth, cultiva|tion, and populou&s;ne&s;s of China and Indo&s;tan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other parts of the new world which he ever vi&s;ited, nothing but a country quite covered with wood, uncul|tivated, and inhabited only by &s;ome tribes of naked and mi&s;erable &s;avages. He was not very willing, however, to believe that they were not the &s;ame with &s;ome of the countries de&s;cribed by Marco Polo, the fir&s;t European who had vi&s;ited, or at lea&s;t had left be|hind him, any de&s;cription of China or the Ea&s;t Indies; and a very
<PB N="151" REF="154">
&s;ight re&s;emblance, &s;uch as that which he found between the name of Cibao, a mountain in St. Domingo, and that of Cipango, men|tioned by Marco Polo, was frequently &s;ufficient to make him return to this favourite prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though contrary to the cleare&s;t evidence. In his letters to Ferdinand and I&s;abella he called the countries which he had di&s;covered the Indies. He entertained no doubt but that they were the extremity of tho&s;e which had been de&s;cribed by Marco Polo, and that they were not very di&s;tant from the Ganges, or from the countries which had been conquered by Alexander. Even when at la&s;t convinced that they were different, he &s;till flat|tered him&s;elf that tho&s;e rich countries were at no great di&s;tance, and, in a &s;ub&s;equent voyage, accordingly, went in que&s;t of them along the coa&s;t of Terra Firma, and towards the i&s;thmus of Darien.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this mi&s;take of Columbus, the name of the Indies has &s;tuck to tho&s;e unfortunate countries ever &s;ince; and when it was at la&s;t clearly di&s;covered that the new were altogether different from the old Indies, the former were called the We&s;t in contradi&s;tinction to the latter, which were called the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>IT was of importance to Columbus, however, that the coun|tries which he had di&s;covered, whatever they were, &s;hould be repre|&s;ented to the court of Spain as of very great con&s;equence; and, in what con&s;titutes the real riches of every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the &s;oil, there was at that time nothing which could well ju&s;tify &s;uch a repre&s;entation of them.</P>
<P>THE Cori, &s;omething between a rat and a rabbit, and &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. Buffon to be the &s;ame with the Aperea of Brazil, was the large&s;t viviparous quadruped in St. Domingo. This &s;pecies &s;eems never to have been very numerous, and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are &s;aid to have long ago almo&s;t entirely extirpated it, as
<PB N="152" REF="155">
well as &s;ome other tribes of a &s;till &s;maller &s;ize. The&s;e, however, together with a pretty large lizard, called the Ivana or Iguana, con&s;tituted the principal part of the animal food which the land afforded.</P>
<P>THE vegetable food of the inhabitants, though from their want of indu&s;try not very abundant, was not altogether &s;o &s;canty. It con&s;i&s;ted in Indian corn, yams, potatoes, bananes, &amp;c. plants which were then altogether unknown in Europe, and which have never &s;ince been very much e&s;teemed in it, or &s;uppo&s;ed to yield a &s;u&s;tenance equal to what is drawn from the common &s;orts of grain and pul&s;e, which have been cultivated in this part of the world time out of mind.</P>
<P>THE cotton plant indeed afforded the material of a very im|portant manufacture, and was at that time to Europeans un|doubtedly the mo&s;t valuable of all the vegetable productions of tho&s;e i&s;lands. But though in the end of the fifteenth century the mu&s;lins and other cotton goods of the Ea&s;t Indies were much e&s;teemed in every part of Europe, the cotton manufacture it&s;elf was not cultivated in any part of it. Even this production there|fore, could not at that time appear in the eyes of Europeans to be of very great con&s;equence.</P>
<P>FINDING nothing either in the animals or vegetables of the newly di&s;covered countries, which could ju&s;tify a very advantageous repre&s;entation of them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals; and in the richne&s;s of the productions of this third kingdom, he flattered him&s;elf, he had found a full compen&s;ation for the in&s;ignificancy of tho&s;e of the other two. The little bits of gold with which the inhabitants ornamented their dre&s;s, and which, he was informed, they frequently found in the rivu|lets and torrents that fell from the mountains, were &s;ufficient to
<PB N="153" REF="156">
&s;atisfy him that tho&s;e mountains abounded with the riche&s;t gold mines. St. Domingo, therefore, was repre&s;ented as a country abounding with gold, and, upon that account, (according to the prejudices not only of the pre&s;ent times, but of tho&s;e times) an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of real wealth to the crown and kingdom of Spain. When Columbus, upon his return from his fir&s;t voyage, was introduced with a &s;ort of triumphal honours to the &s;overeigns of Ca&s;tile and Arragon, the principal productions of the coun|tries which he had di&s;covered were carried in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion before him. The only valuable part of them con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome little fillets, bracelets, and other ornaments of gold, and in &s;ome bales of cotton. The re&s;t were mere objects of vulgar wonder and curio&s;ity; &s;ome reeds of an extraordinary &s;ize, &s;ome birds of a very beautiful plumage, and &s;ome &s;tuffed &s;kins of the huge alligator and manati; all of which were preceeded by &s;ix or &s;even of the wretched natives, who&s;e &s;ingular colour and appearance added greatly to the novelty of the &s;hew.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the repre&s;entations of Columbus, the council of Ca&s;tile determined to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of countries of which the inhabitants were plainly incapable of defending them&s;elves. The pious purpo&s;e of converting them to chri&s;tianity &s;anctified the inju&s;tice of the project. But the hope of finding trea&s;ures of gold there, was the &s;ole motive which prompted to undertake it; and to give this motive the greater weight, it was propo&s;ed by Columbus that the half of all the gold and &s;ilver that &s;hould be found there &s;hould belong to the crown. This pro|po&s;al was approved of by the council.</P>
<P>As long as the whole or the far greater part of the gold, which the fir&s;t adventurers importe into Europe, was got by &s;o very ea&s;y a method as the plundering of the defencele&s;s natives, it was not perhaps very difficult to pay even this heavy tax. But
<PB N="154" REF="157">
when the natives were once fairly &s;tript of all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in all the other countries di&s;covered by Columbus, was done compleatly in &s;ix or eight years, and when in order to find more it had become nece&s;&s;ary to dig for it in the mines, there was no longer any po&s;&s;ibility of paying this tax. The rigorous exaction of it, accordingly, fir&s;t occa|&s;ioned, it is &s;aid, the total abandoning of the mines of St. Do|mingo, which have never been wrought &s;ince. It was &s;oon re|duced therefore to a third; then to a fifth; afterwards to a tenth, and at la&s;t to a twentieth part of the gro&s;s produce of the gold mines. The tax upon &s;ilver, indeed, &s;till continues to be a fifth of the gro&s;s produce. But the fir&s;t adventurers do not appear to have been much intere&s;ted about &s;ilver. Nothing le&s;s precious than gold &s;eemed worthy of their attention.</P>
<P>ALL the other enterprizes of the Spaniards in the new world, &s;ub&s;equent to tho&s;e of Columbus, &s;eem to have been prompted by the &s;ame motive. It was the &s;acred thir&s;t of gold that carried Oieda, Nicue&s;&s;a, and Va&s;co Nugnes de Balboa, to the i&s;thmus of Darien, that carried Cortez to Mexico, and Almagro and Piz|zarro to Chili and Peru. When tho&s;e adventurers arrived upon any unknown coa&s;t, their fir&s;t enquiry was always if there was any gold to be found there; and according to the information which they received concerning this particular, they determined either to quit the country, or to &s;ettle in it.</P>
<P>OF all tho&s;e expen&s;ive and uncertain projects, however, which bring bankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them, there is none perhaps more perfectly ruin|ous than the &s;earch after new &s;ilver and gold mines. It is perhaps the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous lottery in the world, or the one in which the gain of tho&s;e who draw the prizes bears the lea&s;t proportion to the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who draw the blanks: for though the prizes
<PB N="155" REF="158">
are few and the blanks many, the common price of a ticket is the whole fortune of a very rich man. Projects of mining, in|&s;tead of replacing the capital employed in them, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock, commonly ab&s;orb both capital and profit. They are the projects, therefore, to which of all others a prudent law-giver, who de&s;ired to increa&s;e the capital of his nation, would lea&s;t chu&s;e to give any extraordinary encourage|ment, or to turn towards them a greater &s;hare of that capital than what would go to them of its own accord. Such in reality is the ab&s;urd confidence which almo&s;t all men have in their own good fortune, that wherever there is the lea&s;t probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s, too great a &s;hare of it is apt to go to them of its own accord.</P>
<P>BUT though the judgement of &s;ober rea&s;on and experience con|cerning &s;uch projects has always been extreamly unfavourable, that of human avidity has commonly been quite otherwi&s;e. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion which has &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;o many people the ab&s;urd idea of the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, has &s;ugge&s;ted to others the equally ab&s;urd one of immen&s;e rich mines of gold and &s;ilver. They did not con&s;ider that the value of tho&s;e metals has, in all ages and nations, ari&s;en chiefly from their &s;carcity, and that their &s;carcity has ari&s;en from the very &s;mall quantities of them which nature has any where depo&s;ited in one place, from the hard and intract|able &s;ub&s;tances with which &s;he has almo&s;t every where &s;urrounded tho&s;e &s;mall quantities, and con&s;equently from the labour and ex|pence which are every where nece&s;&s;ary in order to penetrate to and get at them. They flattered them&s;elves that veins of tho&s;e metals might in many places be found as large and as abundant as tho&s;e which are commonly found of lead, or copper, or tin, or iron. The dream of Sir Walter Raleigh concerning the golden city and country of Eldorado, may &s;atisfy us that even wi&s;e men
<PB N="156" REF="159">
are not always exempt from &s;uch &s;trange delu&s;ions. More than a hundred years after the death of that great man, the je&s;uit Gumila was &s;till convinced of the reality of that wonderful country, and expre&s;&s;ed with great warmth, and I dare to &s;ay, with great &s;in|cerity, how happy he &s;hould be to carry the light of the go&s;pel to a people who could &s;o well reward the pious labours of their mi&s;&s;ionary.</P>
<P>IN the countries fir&s;t di&s;covered by the Spaniards, no gold or &s;ilver mines are at pre&s;ent known which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth the working. The quantities of tho&s;e metals which the fir&s;t ad|venturers are &s;aid to have found there, had probably been very much magnified, as well as the fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the fir&s;t di&s;covery. What tho&s;e adven|turers were reported to have found, however, was &s;ufficient to enflame the avidity of all their countrymen. Every Spaniard who failed to America expected to find an Eldorado. Fortune too did upon this what &s;he has done upon very few other occa&s;ions. She realized in &s;ome mea&s;ure the extravagant hopes of her votaries, and in the di&s;covery and conque&s;t of Mexico and Peru (of which the one happened about thirty, the other about forty years after the fir&s;t expedition of Columbus) &s;he pre&s;ented them with &s;ome|thing not very unlike that profu&s;ion of the precious metals which they &s;ought for.</P>
<P>A PROJECT of commerce to the Ea&s;t Indies, therefore, gave occa&s;ion to the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the We&s;t. A project of con|que&s;t gave occa&s;ion to all the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the Spaniards in tho&s;e newly di&s;covered countries. The motive which excited them to this conque&s;t was a project of gold and &s;ilver mines; and a cour&s;e of accidents, which no human wi&s;dom could fore&s;ee, ren|dered this project much more &s;ucce&s;sful than the undertakers had any rea&s;onable grounds for expecting.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160">
THE fir&s;t adventurers of all the other nations of Europe, who attempted to make &s;ettlements in America, were animated by the like chimerical views; but they were not equally &s;ucce&s;sful. It was more than a hundred years after the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Brazils, before any &s;ilver, gold, or diamond mines were di&s;covered there. In the Engli&s;h, French, Dutch and Dani&s;h colonies, none have ever yet been di&s;covered; at lea&s;t none that are at pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth the working. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ettlers in North America, however, offered a fifth of all the gold and &s;ilver which &s;hould be found there, to the king as a motive for granting them their patents. In the patents to Sir Walter Raleigh, to the Lon|don and Plymouth companies, to the council of Plymouth, &amp;c. this fifth was accordingly re&s;erved to the crown. To the expecta|tion of finding gold and &s;ilver mines, tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;ettlers too joined that of di&s;covering a north we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies. They have hitherto been di&s;appointed in both.</P>

<HEAD>PART SECOND. <HI>Cau&s;es of the pro&s;perity of new colonies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE colony of a civilized nation which takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, either of a wa&s;te country, or of one &s;o thinly inhabited, that the natives ea&s;ily give place to the new &s;ettlers, advances more rapidly to wealth and greatne&s;s than any other human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE coloni&s;ts carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of other u&s;eful arts, &s;uperior to what can grow up of its own accord in the cour&s;e of many centuries among &s;avage and harbarous nations. They carry out with them too the habit of &s;ubordination, &s;ome notion of the regular government which takes place in their own country, of the &s;y&s;tem of laws which &s;upport it, and of a re|gular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and they naturally e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome|thing of the &s;ame kind in the new &s;ettlement. But among &s;avage
<PB N="158" REF="161">
and barbarous nations, the natural progre&s;s of law and govern|ment is &s;till &s;lower than the natural progre&s;s of arts, after law and government have been &s;o far e&s;tabli&s;hed, as is nece&s;&s;ary for their pro|tection. Every coloni&s;t gets more land than he can po&s;&s;ibly cul|tivate. He has no rent, and &s;carce any taxes to pay. No landlord &s;hares with him in its produce, and the &s;hare of the &s;overeign is commonly but a trifle. He has every motive to render as great as po&s;&s;ible a produce, which is thus to be almo&s;t entirely his own. But his land is commonly &s;o exten&s;ive, that with all his own in|du&s;try, and with all the indu&s;try of other people whom he can get to employ, he can &s;eldom make it produce the tenth part of what it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect la|bourers from all quarters, and to reward them with the mo&s;t liberal wages. But tho&s;e liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheap|ne&s;s of land, &s;oon make tho&s;e labourers leave him in order to be|come landlords them&s;elves, and to reward, with equal liberality, other labourers, who &s;oon leave them for the &s;ame rea&s;on that they left their fir&s;t ma&s;ter. The liberal reward of labour encourages marriage. The children during the tender years of infancy are well fed and properly taken care of, and when they are grown up, the value of their labour greatly over-pays their maintenance. When arrived at maturity, the high price of labour, and the low price of land, enable them to e&s;tablish them&s;elves in the &s;ame man|ner as their fathers did before them.</P>
<P>IN other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two &s;uperior orders of people oppre&s;s the inferior one. But in new co|lonies, the intere&s;t of the two &s;uperior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one with more genero&s;ity and humanity; at lea&s;t, where that inferior one is not in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. Wa&s;te lands, of the greate&s;t natural fertility, are to be had for a trifle. The increa&s;e of revenue which the proprietor, who is always the undertaker, ex|pects
<PB N="159" REF="162">
from their improvement, con&s;titutes his profit; which in the&s;e circum&s;tances is commonly very great. But this great profit cannot be made without employing the labour of other people in clearing and cultivating the land; and the di&s;proportion between the great extent of the land and the &s;mall number of the people, which com|monly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get this labour. He does not, therefore, di&s;pute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any price. The high wages of labour encourage population. The cheapne&s;s and plenty of good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to pay tho&s;e high wages.. In tho&s;e wages con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t the whole price of the land; and though they are high, con&s;idered as the wages of labour, they are low, con&s;idered as the price of what is &s;o very valuable. What encourages the progre&s;s of population and improvement, encou|rages that of real wealth and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of many of the antient Greek colonies towards wealth and greatne&s;s, &s;eems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the cour&s;e of a century or two, &s;everal of them appear to have rivalled and even to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their mother cities. Syracu&s;e and Aggrigentum in Sicily, Tarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephe|&s;us and Miletus in le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, appear by all accounts to have been, at lea&s;t, equal to any of the cities of antient Greece. Though po|&s;terior in their e&s;tabli&s;hment, yet all the arts of refinement, philo|&s;ophy, poetry, and eloquence, &s;eem to have been cultivated as early, and to have been improved as highly in them, as in any part of the mother country. The &s;chools of the two olde&s;t Greek philo&s;o|phers, tho&s;e of Thales and Pythagoras, were e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is re|markable, not in antient Greece, but the one in an A&s;iatick, the other in an Italian colony. All tho&s;e colonies had e&s;tablished them|&s;elves in countries inhabited by &s;avage and barbarous nations, who ea&s;ily gave place to the new &s;ettlers. They had plenty of good land, and as they were altogether independent of the mother city, they
<PB N="160" REF="163">
were at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that they judged was mo&s;t &s;uitable to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the Roman colonies is by no means &s;o bril|liant. Some of them indeed, &s;uch as Florence, have in the cour&s;e of many ages, and after the fall of the mother city, grown up to be con&s;iderable &s;tates. But the progre&s;s of no one of them &s;eems ever to have been very rapid. They were all e&s;tabli&s;hed in conquered provinces, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es had been fully inhabited before. The quantity of land a&s;&s;igned to each coloni&s;t was &s;eldom very con&s;iderable, and as the colony was not independent, they were not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that they judged was mo&s;t &s;uitable to their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the plenty of good land, the European colonies e&s;tabli&s;hed in America and the We&s;t-Indies re&s;emble, and even greatly &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of ancient Greece. In their dependency upon the mother &s;tate, they re&s;emble tho&s;e of antient Rome; but their great di&s;tance from Europe has in all of them alleviated more or le&s;s the effects of this dependency. Their &s;ituation has placed them le&s;s in the view and le&s;s in the power of their mother country. In pur&s;uing their in|tere&s;t their own way, their conduct has, upon many occa&s;ions, been over-looked, either becau&s;e not known or not under&s;tood in Europe; and upon &s;ome occa&s;ions it has been fairly &s;uffered and &s;ubmitted to, becau&s;e their di&s;tance rendered it difficult to re&s;train it. Even the violent and arbitrary government of Spain has, upon many occa&s;ions, been obliged to recall or &s;often the orders which had been given for the government of its colonies, for fear of a general in&s;urrection. The progre&s;s of all the European colonies in wealth, population and improvement, has accordingly been very great.</P>

THE crown of Spain, by its &s;hare of the gold and &s;ilver, derived &s;ome revenue from its colonies, from the moment of their fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. It was a revenue too, of a nature to excite in human avidity the mo&s;t extravagant expectations of &s;till greater riches. The Spani&s;h colonies, therefore, from the moment of their fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, attracted very much the attention of their mother coun|try; while tho&s;e of the other European nations were for a long time in a great mea&s;ure neglected. The former did not, perhaps, thrive the better in con&s;equence of this attention; nor the latter the wor&s;e in con&s;equence of this neglect. In proportion to the extent of the country which they in &s;ome mea&s;ure po&s;&s;e&s;s, the Spani&s;h co|lonies are con&s;idered as le&s;s populous and thriving than tho&s;e of almo&s;t any other European nation. The progre&s;s even of the Spa|ni&s;h colonies, however, in population and improvement, has cer|tainly been very rapid and very great. The city of Lima, founded &s;ince the conque&s;t, is repre&s;ented by Ulloa, as containing fifty thou&s;and inhabitants near thirty years ago. Quito, which had been but a mi&s;erable hamlet of Indians, is repre&s;ented by the &s;ame author as in his time equally populous. Gemelli Carreri, a pre|tended traveller, it is &s;aid, indeed, but who &s;eems every where to have written upon extreme good information, repre&s;ents the city of Mexico as containing a hundred thou&s;and inhabitants; a num|ber which, in &s;pite of all the exaggerations of the Spani&s;h writers, is, probably, more than five times greater than what it contained in the time of Montezuma. The&s;e numbers exceed greatly tho&s;e of Bo&s;ton, New York and Philadelphia, the three greate&s;t cities of the Engli&s;h colonies. Before the conque&s;t of the Spaniards there were no cattle fit for draught, either in Mexico or Peru. The lama was their only bea&s;t of burden, and its &s;trength &s;eems to have been a good deal inferior to that of a common a&s;s. The plough was un|known among them. They were ignorant of the u&s;e of iron. They had no coined money, nor any e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;trument of commerce of any kind. Their commerce was carried on by barter. A &s;ort
<PB N="162" REF="165">
of wooden &s;pade was their principal in&s;trument of agriculture. Sharp &s;tones &s;erved them for knives and hatchets to cut with; fi&s;h bones and the hard &s;inews of certain animals &s;erved them for nee|dles to &s;ew with; and the&s;e &s;eem to have been their principal in&s;tru|ments of trade. In this &s;tate of things, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that either of tho&s;e empires could have been &s;o much improved or &s;o well cultivated as at pre&s;ent, when they are plentifully furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of European cattle, and when the u&s;e of iron, of the plough, and of many of the arts of Europe, has been introduced among them. But the populou&s;ne&s;s of every country mu&s;t be in propor|tion to the degree of its improvement and cultivation. In &s;pite of the cruel de&s;truction of the natives which followed the conque&s;t, the&s;e two great empires are, probably, more populous now than they ever were before, and the people are &s;urely very different; for we mu&s;t acknowledge, I apprehend, that the Spani&s;h creoles are in many re&s;pects &s;uperior to the antient Indians.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ettlements of the Spaniards, that of the Portugueze in Brazil is the olde&s;t of any European nation in America. But as for a long time after the fir&s;t di&s;covery, neither gold nor &s;ilver mines were found in it, and as it afforded, upon that account, little or no revenue to the crown, it was for a long time in a great mea&s;ure neglected; and during this &s;tate of neglect, it grew up to be a great and powerful colony. While Portugal was under the dominion of Spain, Brazil was attacked by the Dutch, who got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;even of the fourteen provinces into which it is divided. They expected &s;oon to conquer the other &s;even, when Portugal recovered its independency by the elevation of the family of Braganza to the throne. The Dutch then, as enemies to the Spaniards, became friends to the Portugueze, who were likewi&s;e the enemies of the Spaniards. They agreed, therefore, to leave that part of Brazil, which they had not conquered, to the king of Portugal, who agreed to leave that part which they had conquered to them, as a matter
<PB N="163" REF="166">
not worth di&s;puting about with &s;uch good allies. But the Dutch government &s;oon began to oppre&s;s the Portugueze coloni&s;ts, who, in&s;tead of amu&s;ing them&s;elves with complaints, took arms again&s;t their new ma&s;ters, and by their own valour and re&s;olution, with the connivance indeed, but without any avowed a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the mother country, drove them out of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore finding it impo&s;&s;ible to keep any part of the country to them&s;elves, were contented that it &s;hould be entirely re&s;tored to the crown of Portugal. In this colony there are &s;aid to be more than &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and people, either Portugueze or de&s;cended from Portu|gueze, creoles, mulattoes, and a mixed race between Portugueze and Brazilians. No one colony in America is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain &s;o great a number of people of European extraction.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the &s;ixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers upon the ocean; for though the commerce of Venice ex|tended to every part of Europe, its fleets had &s;carce ever &s;ailed be|yond the Mediterranean. The Spaniards, in virtue of the fir&s;t di&s;covery, claimed all America as their own; and though they could not hinder &s;o great a naval power as that of Portugal from &s;et|tling in Brazil, &s;uch was, at that time, the terror of their name, that the greater part of the other nations of Europe were afraid to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in any other part of that great continent. The French, who attempted to &s;ettle in Florida, were all murdered by the Spaniards. But the declen&s;ion of the naval power of this latter nation, in con&s;equence of the defeat of mi&s;carriage of, what they called their Invincible Armada, which happened towards the end of the &s;ixteenth century, put it out of their power to ob&s;truct any lon|ger the &s;ettlements of the other European nations. In the cour&s;e of the &s;eventeenth century, therefore, the Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, Danes and Swedes, all the great nations who had any ports upon the ocean, attempted to make &s;ome &s;ettlements in the new world.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="167">
THE Swedes e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in New Jer&s;ey; and the number of Swedi&s;h families &s;till to be found there, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates, that this colony was very likely to pro&s;per, had it been protected by the mother country. But being neglected by Sweden, it was &s;oon &s;wallowed up by the Dutch colony of New York, which again in 1674, fell under the dominion of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall i&s;lands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz are the only countries in the new world that have ever been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Danes. The&s;e little &s;ettlements too were under the government of an exclu&s;ive company, which had the &s;ole right, both of purcha&s;ing the &s;urplus produce of the coloni&s;ts, and of &s;upplying them with &s;uch goods of other countries as they wanted, and which, therefore, both in its purcha&s;es and &s;ales, had not only the power of oppre&s;&s;ing them, but the greate&s;t temptation to do &s;o. The government of an exclu&s;ive company of merchants is, perhaps, the wor&s;t of all govern|ments for any country whatever. It was not, however, able to &s;top altogether the progre&s;s of the&s;e colonies, though it rendered it more &s;low and languid. The late king of Denmark di&s;&s;olved this company, and &s;ince that time the pro&s;perity of the&s;e colonies has been very great.</P>
<P>THE Dutch &s;ettlements in the We&s;t, as well as tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t Indies, were originally put under the government of an exclu&s;ive company. The progre&s;s of &s;ome of them, therefore, though it has been con&s;iderable, in compari&s;on with that of almo&s;t any coun|try that has been long peopled and e&s;tabli&s;hed, has been languid and &s;low in compari&s;on with that of the greater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very con&s;iderable, is &s;till inferior to the greater part of the &s;ugar colonies of the other European nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now divided into the two provinces of New York and New Jer&s;ey, would pro|bably have &s;oon become con&s;iderable too, even though it had re|mained
<PB N="165" REF="168">
under the government of the Dutch. The plenty and cheapne&s;s of good land are &s;uch powerful cau&s;es of pro&s;perity, that the very wor&s;t government is &s;carce capable of checking altogether the efficacy of their operation. The great di&s;tance too from the mother country would enable the coloni&s;ts to evade more or le&s;s by &s;muggling the monopoly which the company enjoyed again&s;t them. At pre&s;ent the company allows all Dutch &s;hips to trade to Surinam upon paying two and a half per cent. upon the value of their cargo for a licence; and only re&s;erves to it&s;elf exclu&s;ively the direct trade from Africa to America, which con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely in the &s;lave trade. This relaxation in the exclu&s;ive privileges of the company, is probably the principal cau&s;e of that degree of pro&s;perity which that colony at pre&s;ent enjoys. Cura&ccedil;oa and Eu&s;tatia, the two principal i&s;lands belonging to the Dutch, are free ports open to the &s;hips of all nations; and this freedom, in the mid&s;t of better colonies who&s;e ports are open to tho&s;e of one nation only, has been the great cau&s;e of the pro&s;perity of tho&s;e two barren i&s;lands.</P>
<P>THE French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the la&s;t century, and &s;ome part of the pre&s;ent, under the govern|ment of an exclu&s;ive company. Under &s;o unfavourable an admi|ni&s;tration its progre&s;s was nece&s;&s;arily very &s;low in compari&s;on with that of other new colonies; but it became much more rapid when this company was di&s;&s;olved after the fall of what is called the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi &s;cheme. When the Engli&s;h got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country, they found in it near double the number of inhabitants which father Char|levoix had a&s;&s;igned to it between twenty and thirty years before. That je&s;uit had travelled over the whole country, and had no in|clination to repre&s;ent it as le&s;s con&s;iderable than it really was.</P>
<P>THE French colony of St. Domingo was e&s;tabli&s;hed by pirates and free-booters, who, for a long time, neither required the pro|tection,
<PB N="166" REF="169">
nor acknowledged the authority of France; and when the race of banditti became &s;o far citizens as to acknowledge this au|thority, it was for a long time nece&s;&s;ary to exerci&s;e it with very great gentlene&s;s. During this period the population and improve|ment of this colony encrea&s;ed very fa&s;t. Even the oppre&s;&s;ion of the exclu&s;ive company to which it was for &s;ome time &s;ubjected, with all the other colonies of France, though it no doubt retarded, had not been able to &s;top its progre&s;s altogether. The cour&s;e of its pro&s;perity returned as &s;oon as it was relieved from that oppre&s;&s;ion. It is now the mo&s;t important of the &s;ugar colonies of the We&s;t Indies, and its produce is &s;aid to be greater than that of all the Engli&s;h &s;ugar colonies put together. The other &s;ugar colonies of France are in general all very thriving.</P>
<P>BUT there are no colonies of which the progre&s;s has been more rapid than that of the Engli&s;h in North America.</P>
<P>PLENTY of good land, and liberty to manage their own affairs their own way, &s;eem to be the two great cau&s;es of the pro&s;perity of all new colonies.</P>
<P>IN the plenty of good land the Engli&s;h colonies of North Ame|rica, though, no doubt, very abundantly provided, are, however, in|ferior to tho&s;e of the Spaniards and Portugueze, and not &s;uperior to &s;ome of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French before the late war. But the political in&s;titutions of the Engli&s;h colonies have been more favour|able to the improvement and cultivation of this land, than tho&s;e of any of the other three nations.</P>
<P>FIRST, the engro&s;&s;ing of uncultivated land, though it has by no means been prevented altogether, has been more re&s;trained in the Engli&s;h colonies than in any other. The colony law which im|po&s;es
<PB N="167" REF="170">
upon every proprietor the obligation of improving and culti|vating, within a limited time, a certain proportion of his lands, and which, in ca&s;e of failure, declares tho&s;e neglected lands grantable to any other per&s;on; though it has not, perhaps, been very &s;trictly executed, has, however, had &s;ome effect.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, in Pen&s;ylvania there is no right of primogeniture, and lands, like moveables, are divided equally among all the chil|dren of the family. In three of the provinces of New England the olde&s;t has only a double &s;hare, as in the Mo&s;aical law. Though in tho&s;e provinces, therefore, too great a quantity of land &s;hould &s;ometimes be engro&s;&s;ed by a particular individual, it is likely, in the cour&s;e of a generation or two, to be &s;ufficiently divided again. In the other Engli&s;h colonies, indeed, the right of primogeniture takes place, as in the law of England. But in all the Engli&s;h co|lonies the tenure of their lands, which are all held by free &s;ocage, facilitates alienation, and the grantee of any exten&s;ive tract of land generally finds it for his intere&s;t to alienate, as fa&s;t as he can, the greater part of it, re&s;erving only a &s;mall quit-rent. In the Spani&s;h and Portugueze colonies, what is called the right of Mayo|razzo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jus Mayoratus.</NOTE> takes place in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e great e&s;tates to which any title of honour is annexed. Such e&s;tates go all to one per&s;on, and are in effect entailed and unalienable. The French colonies, indeed, are &s;ubject to the cu&s;tom of Paris, which, in the inheritance of land, is much more favourable to the younger chil|dren than the law of England. But, in the French colonies, if any part of an e&s;tate, held by the noble tenure of chivalry and homage, is alienated, it is, for a limited time, &s;ubject to the right of redemption, either by the heir of the &s;uperior or by the heir of the family; and all the large&s;t e&s;tates of the country are held by &s;uch noble tenures, which nece&s;&s;arily embarra&s;s alienation. But, in a new colony, a great uncultivated e&s;tate is likely to be much
<PB N="168" REF="171">
more &s;peedily divided by alienation than by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The engro&s;&s;|ing, however, of uncultivated land, it has already been ob&s;erved, is the greate&s;t ob&s;truction to its improvement and cultivation; and the labour that is employed in the improvement and cultivation of land, affords the greate&s;t and mo&s;t valuable produce to the &s;ociety. Its produce, in this ca&s;e, pays not only its own wages, and the profit of the &s;tock which employs it, but the rent of the land too upon which it is employed. The labour of the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts, therefore, being more employed in the improvement and cultiva|tion of land, is likely to afford a greater and more valuable pro|duce than that of any of the other three nations, which, by the engro&s;&s;ing of land, is more or le&s;s diverted towards other employ|ments.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, the labour of the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts is not only likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce, but, in con&s;equence of the moderation of their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs to them&s;elves, which they may &s;tore up and employ in put|ting into motion a &s;till greater quantity of labour. The Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts have never yet contributed any thing towards the defence of the mother country, or towards the &s;upport of its civil govern|ment. They them&s;elves, on the contrary, have hitherto been de|fended almo&s;t entirely at the expence of the mother country. But the expence of fleets and armies is out of all proportion greater than the nece&s;&s;ary expence of civil government. The expence of their own civil government has always been very moderate. It has gene|rally been confined to what was nece&s;&s;ary for paying competent &s;alaries to the governor, to the judges, and to &s;ome other officers of police, and for maintaining a few of the mo&s;t u&s;eful publick works. The expence of the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, before the commencement of the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances, u&s;ed to be but about 18,000l. a year. That of New Hamp&s;hire and
<PB N="169" REF="172">
Rhode I&s;land 3,500l. each. That of Connecticut 4,000l. That of New York and Pen&s;ilvania 4,500l. each. That of New Jer&s;ey 1,200l. That of Virginia and South Carolina 8,000l. each. The civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of Nova Scotia and Georgia are partly &s;upported by an annual grant of parliament. But Nova Scotia pays, be|&s;ides, about 7,000l. a year towards the publick expences of the colony; and Georgia about 2,500l. a year. All the different civil e&s;tabli&s;hments in North America, in &s;hort, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e of Maryland and North Carolina, of which no exact account has been got, did not, before the commencement of the pre&s;ent di&s;tur|bances, co&s;t the inhabitants above 64,700l. a year; an ever me|morable example at how &s;mall an expence three millions of people may not only be governed, but well governed. The mo&s;t impor|tant part of the expence of government, indeed, that of defence and protection, has con&s;tantly fallen upon the mother country. The ceremonial too of the civil government in the colonies, upon the reception of a new governor, upon the opening of a new a&s;&s;embly, &amp;c. though &s;ufficiently decent, is not accompanied with any expen&s;ive pomp or parade. Their eccle&s;ia&s;tical government is conducted upon a plan equally frugal. Tithes are unknown among them; and their clergy, who are far from being numerous, are maintained either by moderate &s;tipends, or by the voluntary contri|butions of the people. The power of Spain and Portugal, on the contrary, derives &s;ome &s;upport from the taxes levied upon their colo|nies. France, indeed, has never drawn any con&s;iderable revenue from its colonies, the taxes which it levies upon them being gene|rally &s;pent among them. But the colony government of all the&s;e three nations is conducted upon a much more expen&s;ive plan, and is accompanied with a much more expen&s;ive ceremonial. The &s;ums &s;pent upon the reception of a new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently been enormous. Such ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich coloni&s;ts upon tho&s;e particular occa&s;ions,
<PB N="170" REF="173">
but they &s;erve to introduce among them the habit of vanity and expence upon all other occa&s;ions. They are not only very grievous occa&s;ional taxes, but they contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h perpetual taxes of the &s;ame kind &s;till more grievous; the ruinous taxes of private luxury and extravagance. In the colonies of all tho&s;e three nations too the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government is extremely oppre&s;&s;ive. Tithes take place in all of them, and are levied with the utmo&s;t rigour in tho&s;e of Spain and Portugal. All of them be&s;ides are oppre&s;&s;ed with a numerous race of mendicant friars, who&s;e beggary being not only licen&s;ed, but con&s;ecrated by religion, is a mo&s;t grievous tax upon the poor people, who are mo&s;t carefully taught that it is a duty to give, and a very great &s;in to refu&s;e them their charity. Over and above all this the clergy are, in all of them, the greate&s;t engro&s;&s;ers of land.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, in the di&s;po&s;al of their &s;urplus produce, or of what is over and above their own con&s;umption, the Engli&s;h colonies have been more favoured, and have been allowed a more exten&s;ive mar|ket than tho&s;e of any other European nation. Every European nation has endeavoured more or le&s;s to monopolize to it&s;elf the commerce of its colonies, and, upon that account, has prohibited the &s;hips of foreign nations from trading to them, and has pro|hibited them from importing European goods from any foreign nation. But the manner in which this monopoly has been exerci&s;ed in different nations has been very different.</P>
<P>SOME nations have given up the whole commerce of their colo|nies to an exclu&s;ive company, of whom the coloni&s;ts were obliged to buy all &s;uch European goods as they wanted, and to whom they were obliged to &s;ell the whole of their own &s;urplus produce. It was the intere&s;t of the company, therefore, not only to &s;ell the for|mer as dear, and to buy the latter as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, but to buy
<PB N="171" REF="174">
no more of the latter, even at this low price, than what they could di&s;po&s;e of for a very high price in Europe. It was their intere&s;t, not only to degrade in all ca&s;es the value of the &s;urplus produce of the colony, but in many ca&s;es to di&s;courage and keep down the natural increa&s;e of its quantity. Of all the expedients that can well be contrived to &s;tunt the natural growth of a new colony, that of an exclu&s;ive company is undoubtedly the mo&s;t effectual. This, however, has been the policy of Holland, though their company in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, has given up in many re&s;pects the exertion of their exclu&s;ive privilege. This too was the policy of Denmark till the reign of the late king. It has occa&s;ionally been the policy of France, and of late, &s;ince 1755, after it had been abandoned by all other nations, on ac|count of its ab&s;urdity, it has become the policy of Portugal with regard at lea&s;t to two of the principal provinces of Brazil, Fer|numbuco and Marannon.</P>
<P>OTHER nations, without e&s;tabli&s;hing an exclu&s;ive company, have confined the whole commerce of their colonies to a parti|cular port of the mother country, from whence no &s;hip was allowed to &s;ail, but either in a fleet and at a particular &s;ea&s;orr, or, if &s;ingle, in con&s;equence of a particular licence, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es was very well paid for. This policy opened, indeed; the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother country, provided they traded from the proper port, at the proper &s;ea&s;on and in the proper ve&s;&s;els. But as all the different merchants, who joined their &s;tocks in order to fit out tho&s;e licen&s;ed ve&s;&s;els, would find it for their intere&s;t to act in concert, the trade which was carried on in this manner would nece&s;&s;arily be conducted very nearly upon the &s;ame principles as that of an exclu&s;ive company. The profit of tho&s;e merchants would be almo&s;t equally exorbi|tant and oppre&s;&s;ive. The colonies would be ill &s;upplied, and
<PB N="172" REF="175">
would be obliged both to buy very dear, and to &s;ell very cheap. This, however, has always been the policy of Spain, and the price of all European goods, accordingly, is &s;aid to be enormous in the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies. At Quito, we are told by Ulloa, a pound of iron &s;ells for about four and &s;ixpence, and a pound of &s;teel for about &s;ix and nine-pence &s;terling. But it is chiefly in order to purcha&s;e European goods, that the colonies part with their own produce. The more, therefore, they pay for the one, the le&s;s they really get for the other, and the dearne&s;s of the one is the &s;ame thing with the cheapne&s;s of the other. The policy of Por|tugal is in this re&s;pect the &s;ame as that of Spain, with regard to all its colonies, except Fernambuco and Marannon, and with regard to the&s;e it has lately adopted a &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>OTHER nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their &s;ubjects who may carry it on from all the different ports of the mother country, and who have occa&s;ion for no other licence than the common di&s;patches of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e. In this ca&s;e the number and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation of the different traders ren|ders it impo&s;&s;ible for them to enter into any general combination, and their competition is &s;ufficient to hinder them from making very exorbitant profits. Under &s;o liberal a policy the colonies are enabled both to &s;ell their own produce and to buy the goods of Europe at a rea&s;onable price. But &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the Plymouth company, when our colonies were but in their in|fancy, this has always been the policy of England. It has ge|nerally too been that of France, and it has been uniformly &s;o &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of what, in England, is commonly called their Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi company. The profits of the trade therefore which France and England carry on with their colonies, though no doubt &s;omewhat higher than if the competition was free to all other nations, are, however, by no means exorbitant; and the price of European goods accordingly is not extravagantly high in the greater part of the colonies of either of tho&s;e nations.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176">
IN the exportation of their own &s;urplus produce too it is only with regard to certain commodities that the colonies of Great Bri|tain are confined to the market of the mother country. The&s;e commodities having been enumerated in the Act of navigation and in &s;ome other &s;ub&s;equent acts, have upon that account been called <HI>enumerated commodities.</HI> The re&s;t are called <HI>non-enumerated;</HI> and may be exported directly to other countries, provided it is in Briti&s;h or Plantation &s;hips of which the owners and three-fourths of the mariners are Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>AMONG the non-enumerated commodities are &s;ome of the mo&s;t important productions of America and the We&s;t Indies; grain of all &s;orts, lumber, &s;alt provi&s;ions, fi&s;h, &s;ugar, and rum.</P>
<P>GRAIN is naturally the fir&s;t and principal object of the cul|ture of all new colonies. By allowing them a very exten&s;ive market for it, the law encourages them to extend this culture much beyond the con&s;umption of a thinly inhabited country, and thus to provide beforehand an ample &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for a con|tinually increa&s;ing population.</P>
<P>IN a country quite covered with wood, where timber con|&s;equently is of little or no value, the expence of clearing the ground is the principal ob&s;tacle to improvement. By allowing the colonies a very exten&s;ive market for their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate improvement by rai&s;ing the price of a commodity which would otherwi&s;e be of little value, and thereby enabling them to make &s;ome profit of what would otherwi&s;e be meer expence.</P>
<P>IN a country neither half peopled nor half cultivated, cattle naturally multiply beyond the con&s;umption of the inhabitants, and are often upon that account of little or no value. But it is
<PB N="174" REF="177">
nece&s;&s;ary, it has already been &s;hewn, that the price of cattle &s;hould bear a certain proportion to that of corn before the greater part of the lands of any country can be improved. By allowing to American cattle, in all &s;hapes, dead and alive, a very exten&s;ive market, the law endeavours to rai&s;e the value of a commodity of which the high price is &s;o very e&s;&s;ential to improvement. The good effects of this liberty, however, mu&s;t be &s;omewhat dimini&s;h|ed by the 4th of George III. c. 15. which puts hides and &s;kins among the enumerated commodities, and thereby tends to reduce the value of American cattle.</P>
<P>TO increa&s;e the &s;hipping and naval power of Great Britain, by the exten&s;ion of the fi&s;heries of our colonies, is an object which the legi&s;lature &s;eems to have had almo&s;t con&s;tantly in view. Tho&s;e fi&s;heries, upon this account, have had all the encouragement which freedom can give them, and they have flouri&s;hed accordingly. The New-England fi&s;hery in particular was, before the late di&s;tur|bances, one of the mo&s;t important, perhaps, in the world. The whale-fi&s;hery which, notwith&s;tanding an extravagant bounty, is in Great Britain carried on to &s;o little purpo&s;e, that in the opinion of many people (which I do not, however, pretend to warrant) the whole produce does not much exceed the value of the bounties which are annually paid for it, is in New England carried on without any bounty to a very great extent. Fi&s;h is one of the principal articles with which the North Americans trade to Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>SUGAR was originally an enumerated commodity which could be exported only to Great Britain. But in 1731, upon a repre&s;enta|tion of the &s;ugar planters, its exportation was permitted to all parts of the world. The re&s;trictions, however, with which this liberty was granted, joined to the high price of &s;ugar in Great Britain, have rendered it, in a great mea&s;ure, ineffectual. Great Britain
<PB N="175" REF="178">
and her colonies, &s;till continue to be almo&s;t the &s;ole market for all the &s;ugar produced in the Briti&s;h plantations. Their con&s;umption increa&s;es &s;o fa&s;t that, though in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ing im|provement of Jamaica as well as of the ceded i&s;lands, the importation of &s;ugar has increa&s;ed very greatly within the&s;e twenty years, the exportation to foreign countries is &s;aid to be not much greater than before.</P>
<P>RUM is a very important article in the trade which the Americans carry on to the coa&s;t of Africa, from which they bring back negroe &s;laves in return.</P>
<P>IF the whole &s;urplus produce of America in grain of all &s;orts, in &s;alt provi&s;ions and in fi&s;h, had been put into the enumeration, and thereby forced into the market of Great Britain, it would have interfered too much with the produce of the indu&s;try of our own people. It was probably not &s;o much from any regard to the intere&s;t of America, as from a jealou&s;y of this interference, that tho&s;e important commodities have not only been kept out of the enumeration, but that the importation into Great Britain of all grain, except rice, and of &s;alt provi&s;ions has, in the ordinary &s;tate of the law, been prohibited.</P>
<P>THE non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all parts of the world. Lumber and rice, having been once put into the enumeration, when they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to the European market, to the countries that lie &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre. By the 6th of George III. c. 52. all non-enumerated commodities were &s;ubjected to the like re|&s;triction. The parts of Europe which lie &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre, are not manufacturing countries, and we were le&s;s jealous of the colony &s;hips carrying home from them any manufactures which could interfere with our own.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="179">
THE enumerated commodities are of two &s;orts: fir&s;t, &s;uch as are either the peculiar produce of America, or as cannot be pro|duced, or at lea&s;t are not produced in the mother country. Of this kind are mela&s;&s;es, coffee, cacao-nuts, tobacco, pimento, ginger, whale-fins, raw &s;ilk, cotton-wool, beaver, and other peltry of America, indigo, fu&s;tick, and other dying woods: &s;e|condly, &s;uch as are not the peculiar produce of America, but which are and may be produced in the mother country, though not in &s;uch quantities as to &s;upply the greater part of her demand, which is principally &s;upplied from foreign countries. Of this kind are all naval &s;tores, ma&s;ts, yards, and bow&s;prits, tar, pitch, and turpentine, pig and bar iron, copper ore, hides and &s;kins, pot and pearl a&s;hes. The large&s;t importation of commodities of the fir&s;t kind could not di&s;courage the growth or interfere with the &s;ale of any part of the produce of the mother country. By con&s;ining them to the home market, our merchants, it was expected, would not only be enabled to buy them cheaper in the plantations, and con&s;equently to &s;ell them with a better profit at home, but to e&s;tabli&s;h between the plantations and foreign countries an advan|tageous carrying trade, of which Great Britain was nece&s;&s;arily to be the center or emporium, as the European country into which tho&s;e commodities were fir&s;t to be imported. The importation of commodities of the &s;econd kind might be &s;o managed too, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, as to interfere, not with the &s;ale of tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind which were produced at home, but with that of tho&s;e which were imported from foreign countries; becau&s;e by means of proper duties, they might be rendered always &s;omewhat dearer than the former, and yet a good deal cheaper than the latter. By confining &s;uch commodities to the home market, therefore, it was propo&s;ed to di&s;courage the produce, not of Great Britain, but of &s;ome foreign countries with which the balance of trade was believed to be unfavourable to Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="180">
THE prohibition of exporting from the colonies, to any other country but Great Britain, ma&s;ts, yards, and bow&s;prits, tar, pitch, and turpentine, naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies, and con&s;equently to increa&s;e the expence of clearing their lands, the principal ob&s;tacle to their improve|ment. But about the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, in 1703, the pitch and tar company of Sweden endeavoured to rai&s;e the price of their commodities to Great Britain, by prohibiting their exportation, except in their own &s;hips, at their own price, and in &s;uch quantities as they thought proper. In order to counteract this notable piece of mercantile policy, and to render her&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible independent, not only of Sweden, but of all the other northern powers, Great Britain gave a bounty upon the importation of naval &s;tores from America, and the effect of this bounty was to rai&s;e the price of timber in America, much more than the con&s;inement to the home market could lower it; and as both regulations were enacted at the &s;ame time, their joint effect was rather to encourage than to di&s;courage the clearing of land in America.</P>
<P>THOUGH pig and bar iron too have been put among the enu|merated commodities, yet as, when imported from America, they are exempted from con&s;iderable duties to which they are &s;ubject when imported from any other country, the one part of the regu|lation contributes more to encourage the erection of furnaces in America, than the other to di&s;courage it. There is no manufacture which occa&s;ions &s;o great a con&s;umption of wood as a furnace, or which can contribute &s;o much to the clearing of a country overgrown with it.</P>
<P>THE tendency of &s;ome of the&s;e regulations to rai&s;e the value of timber in America, and, thereby, to facilitate the clearing of the land, was neither, perhaps, intended nor under&s;tood by
<PB N="178" REF="181">
the legi&s;lature. Though their beneficial effects, however, have been in this re&s;pect accidental, they have not upon that account been le&s;s real.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the Briti&s;h colonies of America and the We&s;t Indies, both in the enume|rated and in the non-enumerated commodities. Tho&s;e colonies are now become &s;o populous and thriving, that each of them finds in &s;ome of the others a great and exten&s;ive market for every part of its produce. All of them taken together, they make a great internal market for the produce of one another.</P>
<P>THE liberality of England, however, towards the trade of her colonies has been confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce, either in its rude &s;tate, or in what may be called the very fir&s;t &s;tage of manufacture. The more advanced or more refined manufactures even of the colony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain chu&s;e to re&s;erve to them&s;elves, and have prevailed upon the legi&s;lature to prevent their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in the colonies, &s;ometimes by high duties, and &s;ometimes by ab&s;olute prohibitions.</P>
<P>WHILE, for example, Mu&s;kovado &s;ugars from the Briti&s;h plan|tations, pay upon importation only 6s. 4d. the hundred weight; white &s;ugars pay 1l. 1s. 1d.; and refined, either double or &s;ingle, in loaves 4l. 2s. 5d. 8/20. When tho&s;e high duties were impo&s;ed, Great Britain was the &s;ole, and &s;he &s;till continues to be the principal market to which the &s;ugars of the Briti&s;h colonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a prohibition, at fir&s;t of claying or refin|ing &s;ugar for any foreign market, and at pre&s;ent of claying or refining it for the market, which takes off, perhaps, more than nine-tenths of the whole produce. The manufacture of claying or refining &s;ugar accord|ingly,
<PB N="179" REF="182">
though it has flouri&s;hed in all the &s;ugar colonies of France, has been little cultivated in any of tho&s;e of England, except for the market of the colonies them&s;elves. While Grenada was in the hands of the French, there was a refinery of &s;ugar by claying, at lea&s;t, upon almo&s;t every plantation. Since it fell into tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, almo&s;t all works of this kind have been given up, and there are at pre&s;ent, October 1773, I am a&s;&s;ured, not above two or three remaining in the i&s;land. At pre&s;ent, however, by an indulgence of the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, clayed or refined &s;ugar, if reduced from loaves into powder, is commonly imported as Mu&s;kovado.</P>
<P>WHILE Great Britain encourages in America the manufactures of pig and bar iron, by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities are &s;ubject when imported from any other country, &s;he impo&s;es an ab&s;olute prohibition upon the erection of &s;teel furnaces and &s;lit-mills in any of her American plantations. She will not &s;uffer her coloni&s;ts to work in tho&s;e more refined manufactures even for their own con&s;umption; but in&s;i&s;ts upon their purcha&s;ing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods of this kind which they have occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>SHE prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water, and even the carriage by land upon hor&s;e-back or in a cart, of hats, of wools and woollen goods, of the produce of America; a regulation which effectually prevents the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any manufacture of &s;uch commodities for di&s;tant &s;ale, and confines the indu&s;try of her coloni&s;ts in this way to &s;uch coar&s;e and hou&s;hold manufactures, as a private family commonly makes for its own u&s;e, or for that of &s;ome of its neighbours in the &s;ame province.</P>
<P>TO prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employing their &s;tock
<PB N="180" REF="183">
and indu&s;try in the way that they judge mo&s;t advantageous to them|&s;elves, is a manife&s;t violation of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of mankind. Unju&s;t, however, as &s;uch prohibitions may be, they have not hitherto been very hurtful to the colonies. Land is &s;till &s;o cheap, and, con&s;equently, labour &s;o dear among them, that they can import from the mother country, almo&s;t all the more refined or more advanced manufactures cheaper than they could make them for them&s;elves. Though they had not, therefore, been prohibited from e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch manufactures, yet in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of improve|ment, a regard to their own intere&s;t would, probably, have pre|vented them from doing &s;o. In their pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement, tho&s;e prohibitions, perhaps, without cramping their indu&s;try, or re&s;training it from any employment to which it would have gone of its own accord, are only impertinent badges of &s;lavery impo&s;ed upon them, without any &s;ufficient rea&s;on, by the groundle&s;s jealou&s;y of the merchants and manufacturers of the mother country. In a more advanced &s;tate they might be really oppre&s;&s;ive and in&s;up|portable.</P>
<P>GREAT Britain too, as &s;he confines to her own market &s;ome of the mo&s;t important productions of the colonies, &s;o in compen&s;ation &s;he gives to &s;ome of them an advantage in that market; &s;ometimes by impo&s;ing higher duties upon the like productions when imported from other countries, and &s;ometimes by giving bounties upon their importation from the colonies. In the fir&s;t way &s;he gives an advan|tage in the home market to the &s;ugar, tobacco and iron of her own colonies, and in the &s;econd, to their raw &s;ilk, to their hemp and flax, to their indigo, to their naval &s;tores, and to their building timber. This &s;econd way of encouraging the colony produce by bounties upon importation, is, &s;o far as I have been able to learn, peculiar to Great Britain. The fir&s;t is not. Portugal does not content her&s;elf with impo&s;ing higher duties upon the importation of
<PB N="181" REF="184">
tobacco from any other country, but prohibits it under the &s;evere&s;t penalties.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the importation of goods from Europe, England has likewi&s;e dealt more liberally with her colonies than any other nation.</P>
<P>GREAT Britain allows a part, almo&s;t always the half, generally a larger portion, and &s;ometimes the whole of the duty which is paid upon the importation of foreign goods, to be drawn back upon their exportation to any foreign country. No inde|pendent foreign country, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, would receive them if they came to it loaded with the heavy duties to which almo&s;t all foreign goods are &s;ubjected on their importation into Great Britain. Unle&s;s, therefore, &s;ome part of tho&s;e duties was drawn back upon exportation, there was an end of the carrying trade; a trade &s;o much favoured by the mercantile &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>OUR colonies, however, are by no means independent foreign countries; and Great Britain having a&s;&s;umed to her&s;elf the exclu&s;ive right of &s;upplying them with all goods from Europe, might have forced them (in the &s;ame manner as other countries have done their colonies) to receive &s;uch goods, loaded with all the &s;ame duties which they paid in the mother country. But, on the contrary, till 1763, the &s;ame drawbacks were paid upon the exportation of the greater part of foreign goods to our colonies as to any independent foreign country. In 1763, indeed, by the 4th of George IIId, c. 15. this indulgence was a good deal abated, and it was enacted, <Q REND="inline">That no part of the duty called the old &s;ub&s;idy &s;hould be drawn back for any goods of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe or the Ea&s;t Indies, which &s;hould be exported from this kingdom to any Briti&s;h colony or plantation in America; wines, white callicoes and mu&s;lins excepted.</Q> Before this law, many different &s;orts of foreign goods might have been bought
<PB N="182" REF="185">
cheaper in the plantations than in the mother country; and &s;ome may &s;till.</P>
<P>OF the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade, the merchants who carry it on, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, have been the principal advi&s;ers. We mu&s;t not wonder, therefore, if in the greater part of them, their intere&s;t has been more con&s;idered than either that of the colonies or that of the mother country. In their exclu&s;ive privilege of &s;upplying the colonies with all the goods which they wanted from Europe, and of purcha&s;ing all &s;uch parts of their &s;urplus produce as could not interfere with any of the trades which they them&s;elves carried on at home, the intere&s;t of the colonies was &s;acrificed to the intere&s;t of tho&s;e merchants. In allowing the &s;ame drawbacks upon the re-exportation of the greater part of European and Ea&s;t India goods to the colonies, as upon their re-exportation to any independent country, the intere&s;t of the mother country was &s;acrificed to it, even according to the mercantile ideas of that intere&s;t. It was for the intere&s;t of the merchants to pay as little as po&s;&s;ible, for the foreign goods which they &s;ent to the colonies, and, con&s;equently, to get back as much as po&s;&s;ible of the duties which they advanced upon their importation into Great Britain. They might thereby be enabled to &s;ell in the colonies, either the &s;ame quantity of goods with a greater profit, or a greater quantity with the &s;ame profit, and, con&s;equently, to gain &s;omething either in the one way or the other. It was, likewi&s;e, for the intere&s;t of the colonies to get all &s;uch goods as cheap and in as great abundance as po&s;&s;ible. But this might not always be for the intere&s;t of the mother country. She might frequently &s;uffer both in her revenue, by giving back a great part of the duties which had been paid upon the importation of &s;uch goods; and in her manu|factures, by being under&s;old in the colony market, in con&s;equence of the ea&s;y terms upon which foreign manufactures could be carried thither by means of tho&s;e drawbacks. The progre&s;s of the linen
<PB N="183" REF="186">
manufacture of Great Britain, it is commonly &s;aid, has been a good deal retarded by the drawbacks upon the re-exportation of German linen to the American colonies.</P>
<P>BUT though the policy of Great Britain with regard to the trade of her colonies has been dictated by the &s;ame mercantile &s;pirit as that of other nations, it has, however, upon the whole, been le&s;s illiberal and oppre&s;&s;ive than that of any of them.</P>
<P>IN every thing, except their foreign trade, the liberty of the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts to manage their own affairs their own way is compleat. It is in every re&s;pect equal to that of their fellow citizens at home, and is &s;ecured in the &s;ame manner, by an a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;en|tatives of the people, who claim the &s;ole right of impo&s;ing taxes for the &s;upport of the colony government. The authority of this a&s;&s;embly over-awes the executive power, and neither the meane&s;t nor the mo&s;t obnoxious coloni&s;t, as long as he obeys the law, has any thing to fear from the re&s;entment either of the governour or of any other civil or military officer in the province. The colony a&s;&s;emblies, though, like the hou&s;e of commons in England, they are not always a very equal repre&s;entation of the people, yet as the executive power either has not the means to corrupt them, or, on account of the &s;upport which it receives from the mother country, is not under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o, they are perhaps in general more influenced by the inclinations of their con&s;ti|tuents. The councils, which, in the colony legi&s;latures, corre|&s;pond to the Hou&s;e of Lords in Great Britain, are not compo&s;ed of an hereditary nobility. In &s;ome of the colonies, as in three of the governments of New England, tho&s;e councils are not appointed by the king, but cho&s;en by the repre&s;entatives of the people. In none of the Engli&s;h colonies is there any hereditary nobility. In all of them, indeed, as in all other free countries, the de&s;cendant of an old colony family is more re&s;pected than an up&s;tart
<PB N="184" REF="187">
of equal merit and fortune: but he is only more re&s;pected, and he has no privileges by which he can be trouble&s;ome to his neigh|bours. Before the commencement of the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances, the colony a&s;&s;emblies had not only the legi&s;lative, but a part of the executive power. In Connecticut and Rhode i&s;land, they elected the governor. In the other colonies they appointed the revenue officers who collected the taxes impo&s;ed by tho&s;e re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies, to whom tho&s;e officers were immediately re&s;pon&s;ible. There is more equality, therefore, among the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts than among the inha|bitants of the mother country. Their manners are more republican, and their governments, tho&s;e of three of the provinces of New England in particular, have hitherto been more republican too.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;olute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the contrary, take place in their colonies; and the di&s;cretionary powers which &s;uch governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on account of the great di&s;tance, naturally exerci&s;ed there with more than ordinary violence. Under all ab&s;olute governments there is more liberty in the capital than in any other part of the country. The &s;overeign him&s;elf can never have either intere&s;t or inclination to pervert the order of ju&s;tice, or to oppre&s;s the great body of the people. In the capital his pre|&s;ence over-awes more or le&s;s all his inferior officers, who in the remoter provinces, from whence the complaints of the people are le&s;s likely to reach him, can exerci&s;e their tyranny with much more &s;afety. But the European colonies in America are more remote than the mo&s;t di&s;tant provinces of the greate&s;t empires which had ever been known before. The government of the Engli&s;h colo|nies is perhaps the only one which, &s;ince the world began, could give perfect &s;ecurity to the inhabitants of &s;o very di&s;tant a pro|vince. The admini&s;tration of the French colonies, however, has always been conducted with more gentlene&s;s and moderation than that of the Spani&s;h and Portugueze. This &s;uperiority of conduct
<PB N="185" REF="188">
is &s;uitable both to the character of the French nation, and to what forms the character of every nation, the nature of their govern|ment, which though arbitrary and violent in compari&s;on with that of Great Britain, is legal and free in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Spain and Portugal.</P>
<P>IT is in the progre&s;s of the North American colonies, however, that the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h policy chiefly appears. The progre&s;s of the &s;ugar colonies of France has been at lea&s;t equal, perhaps &s;uperior, to that of the greater part of tho&s;e of England; and yet the &s;ugar colonies of England enjoy a free government nearly of the &s;ame kind with that which takes place in her colonies of North America. But the &s;ugar colonies of France are not di&s;|couraged, like tho&s;e of England, from refining their own &s;ugar; and, what is of &s;till greater importance, the genius of their govern|ment naturally introduces a better management of their negro &s;laves.</P>
<P>IN all European colonies the culture of the &s;ugar cane is carried on by negro &s;laves. The con&s;titution of tho&s;e who have been born in the temperate climate of Europe could not, it is &s;up|po&s;ed, &s;upport the labour of digging the ground under the burn|ing &s;un of the We&s;t Indies; and the culture of the &s;ugar cane, as it is managed at pre&s;ent, is all hand labour, though, in the opi|nion of many, the drill plough might be introduced into it with great advantage. But, as the profit and &s;ucce&s;s of the cultiva|tion which is carried on by means of cattle, depend very much upon the good management of tho&s;e cattle; &s;o the profit and &s;uc|ce&s;s of that which is carried on by &s;laves, mu&s;t depend equally upon the good management of tho&s;e &s;laves; and in the good manage|ment of their &s;laves the French planters, I think it is generally allowed, are &s;uperior to the Engli&s;h. The law, &s;o far as it gives
<PB N="186" REF="189">
&s;ome weak protection to the &s;lave again&s;t the violence of his ma&s;ter, is likely to be better executed in a colony where the government is in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary, than in one where it is altogether free. In every country where the unfortunate law of &s;lavery is e&s;tabli&s;hed, the magi&s;trate, when he protects the &s;lave, intermeddles in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the management of the private property of the ma&s;ter; and, in a free country, where the ma&s;ter is perhaps either a mem|ber of the colony a&s;&s;embly, or an elector of &s;uch a member, he dare not do this but with the greate&s;t caution and circum&s;pection. The re&s;pect which he is obliged to pay to the ma&s;ter, renders it more difficult for him to protect the &s;lave. But in a country where the government is in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary, where it is u&s;ual for the magi&s;trate to intermeddle even in the management of the pri|vate property of individuals, and to &s;end them, perhaps, a lettre de cachet if they do not manage it according to his liking, it is much ea&s;ier for him to give &s;ome protection to the &s;lave; and common humanity naturally di&s;po&s;es him to do &s;o. The protection of the magi&s;trate renders the &s;lave le&s;s contemptible in the eyes of his ma&s;ter, who is thereby induced to con&s;ider him with more regard, and to treat him with more gentlene&s;s. Gentle u&s;age renders the &s;lave not only more faithful, but more intelligent, and therefore, upon a double account, more u&s;eful. He approaches more to the condition of a free &s;ervant, and may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome degree of inte|grity and attachment to his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, virtues which fre|quently belong to free &s;ervants, but which never can belong to a &s;lave, who is treated as &s;laves commonly are in countries where the ma&s;ter is perfectly free and &s;ecure.</P>
<P>THAT the condition of a &s;lave is better under an arbitrary than under a free government, is, I believe, &s;upported by the hi&s;tory of all ages and nations. In the Roman hi&s;tory, the fir&s;t time we read of the magi&s;trate interpo&s;ing to protect the &s;lave from the violence
<PB N="187" REF="190">
of his ma&s;ter, is under the emperors. When Vedius Pollio, in the pre&s;ence of Augu&s;tus, ordered one of his &s;laves, who had com|mitted a &s;light fault, to be cut into pieces and thrown into his fi&s;h pond in order to feed his fi&s;hes, the emperor commanded him, with indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that &s;lave, but all the others that belonged to him. Under the republick no magi&s;trate could have had authority enough to protect the &s;lave, much le&s;s to puni&s;h the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE &s;tock, it is to be ob&s;erved, which has improved the &s;ugar colonies of France, particularly the great colony of St. Domingo, has been rai&s;ed almo&s;t entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of tho&s;e colonies. It has been almo&s;t altogether the produce of the &s;oil and indu&s;try of the coloni&s;ts, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of that produce gradually accumulated by good management, and employed in rai&s;ing a &s;till greater pro|duce. But the &s;tock which has improved and cultivated the &s;ugar colonies of England has, a great part of it, been &s;ent out from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce of the &s;oil and indu&s;try of the coloni&s;ts. The pro&s;perity of the Engli&s;h &s;ugar colonies has been, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the great riches of England, of which a part has overflowed, if one may &s;ay &s;o, upon tho&s;e colonies. But the pro&s;perity of the &s;ugar colonies of France has been entirely owing to the good conduct of the coloni&s;ts, which mu&s;t therefore have had &s;ome &s;uperiority over that of the Engli&s;h; and this &s;uperiority has been remarked in nothing &s;o much as in the good management of their &s;laves.</P>
<P>SUCH have been the general outlines of the policy of the different European nations with regard to their colonies.</P>
<P>THE policy of Europe, therefore, has very little to boa&s;t of, either in the original e&s;tabli&s;hment, or in the &s;ub&s;equent pro&s;pe|rity of the colonies of America.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="191">
FOLLY and inju&s;tice &s;eem to have been the principles which pre&s;ided over and directed the fir&s;t project of e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e colonies; the folly of hunting after gold and &s;ilver mines, and the inju&s;tice of coveting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a country who&s;e harmle&s;s natives, far from having ever injured the people of Europe, had received the fir&s;t adventurers with every mark of kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>THE adventurers, indeed, who formed &s;ome of the later e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, joined, to the chimerical project of finding gold and &s;ilver mines, other motives more rea&s;onable and more laudable; but even the&s;e motives do very little honour to the policy of Europe.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h puritans, per&s;ecuted at home, fled for freedom to America, and e&s;tabli&s;hed there the four governments of New Eng|land. The Engli&s;h catholicks, treated with equal inju&s;tice, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed that of Maryland; the Quakers, that of Pen&s;ylvania. The Portugueze Jews, per&s;ecuted by the inqui&s;ition, &s;tript of their for|tunes, and bani&s;hed to Brazil, introduced, by their example, &s;ome &s;ort of order and indu&s;try among the tran&s;ported felons and &s;trum|pets, by whom that colony was originally peopled, and taught them the culture of the &s;ugar cane. Upon all the&s;e different occa|&s;ions it was, not the wi&s;dom and policy, but the di&s;order and inju|&s;tice of the European governments, which peopled and cultivated America.</P>
<P>IN effectuating &s;ome of the mo&s;t important of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, the different governments of Europe had as little merit as in projecting them. The conque&s;t of Mexico was the project, not of the council of Spain, but of a governor of Cuba; and it was effectuated by the &s;pirit of the bold adventurer to whom it was
<PB N="189" REF="192">
entru&s;ted, in &s;pite of every thing which that governor, who &s;oon repented of having tru&s;ted &s;uch a per&s;on, could do to thwart it. The conquerors of Chili and Peru, and of almo&s;t all the other Spani&s;h &s;ettlements upon the continent of America, carried out with them no other publick encouragement, but a general per|mi&s;&s;ion to make &s;ettlements and conque&s;ts in the name of the king of Spain. Tho&s;e adventures were all at the private ri&s;k and ex|pence of the adventurers. The government of Spain contributed &s;carce any thing to any of them. That of England contributed as little towards effectuating the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome of its mo&s;t important colonies in North America.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments were effectuated, and had become &s;o con&s;iderable as to attract the attention of the mother country, the fir&s;t regulations which &s;he made with regard to them had always in view to &s;ecure to her&s;elf the monopoly of their commerce; to confine their market, and to enlarge her own at their expence, and, con&s;equently, rather to damp and di&s;courage, than to quicken and forward the cour&s;e of their pro&s;perity. In the different ways in which this monopoly has been exerci&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ts one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential differences in the policy of the different European nations with regard to their colonies. The be&s;t of them all, that of Eng|land, is only &s;omewhat le&s;s illiberal and oppre&s;&s;ive than that of any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IN what way, therefore, has the policy of Europe contributed either to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, or to the pre&s;ent grandeur of the colo|nies of America? In one way, and in one way only, it has contri|buted a good deal. <HI>Magna vir&ucirc;m Mater!</HI> It bred and formed the men who were capable of atchieving &s;uch great actions, and of laying the foundation of &s;o great an empire; and there is no other quarter of the world of which the policy is capable of forming,
<PB N="190" REF="193">
or has ever actually and in fact formed &s;uch men. The colo|nies owe to the policy of Europe the education and great views of their active and enterprizing founders; and &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important of them, owe to it &s;carce any thing el&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>PART THIRD. <HI>Of the Advantages which Europe has derived from the Di&s;covery of America, and from that of a Pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies by the Cape of Good Hope.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUCH are the advantages which the colonies of America have derived from the policy of Europe.</P>
<P>WHAT are tho&s;e which Europe has derived from the di&s;covery and colonization of America?</P>
<P>THOSE advantages may be divided, fir&s;t, into the general advan|tages which Europe, con&s;idered as one great country, has derived from tho&s;e great events; and, &s;econdly, into the particular advan|tages which each colonizing country has derived from the colonies which particularly belong to it, in con&s;equence of the authority or dominion which it exerci&s;es over them.</P>
<P>THE general advantages which Europe, con&s;idered as one great country, has derived from the di&s;covery and colonization of Ame|rica, con&s;i&s;t, fir&s;t, in the increa&s;e of its enjoyments; and, &s;econd|ly, in the augmentation of its indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE &s;urplus produce of America, imported into Europe, fur|ni&s;hes the inhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which they could not otherwi&s;e have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;ome for conveniency and u&s;e, &s;ome for plea&s;ure, and &s;ome for orna|ment, and thereby contributes to increa&s;e their enjoyments.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="194">
THE di&s;covery and colonization of America, it will readily be allowed, have contributed to augment the indu&s;try, fir&s;t, of all the countries which trade to it directly; &s;uch as Spain, Portugal, France, and England; and, &s;econdly, of all tho&s;e which, without trading to it directly, &s;end, through the medium of other coun|tries, goods to it of their own produce; &s;uch as Au&s;trian Flan|ders, and &s;ome provinces of Germany, which, through the medium of the countries before mentioned, &s;end to it a con&s;iderable quan|tity of linen and other goods. All &s;uch countries have evidently gained a more exten&s;ive market for their &s;urplus produce, and mu&s;t con&s;equently have been encouraged to increa&s;e its quantity.</P>
<P>BUT, that tho&s;e great events &s;hould likewi&s;e have contributed to encourage the indu&s;try of countries, &s;uch as Hungary and Poland, which may never, perhaps, have &s;ent a &s;ingle commodity of their own produce to America, is not, perhaps, altogether &s;o evident. That tho&s;e events have done &s;o, however, cannot be doubted. Some part of the produce of America is con&s;umed in Hungary and Po|land, and there is &s;ome demand there for the &s;ugar, chocolate, and tobacco, of that new quarter of the world. But tho&s;e commodi|ties mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed with &s;omething which is either the produce of the indu&s;try of Hungary and Poland, or with &s;omething which had been purcha&s;ed with &s;ome part of that produce. Tho&s;e com|modities of America are new values, new equivalents, introduced into Hungary and Poland, to be exchanged there for the &s;urplus produce of tho&s;e countries. By being carried thither they create a new and more exten&s;ive market for that &s;urplus produce. They rai&s;e its value, and thereby contribute to encourage its increa&s;e. Though no part of it may ever be carried to America, it may be carried to other countries which purcha&s;e it with a part of their &s;hare of the &s;urplus produce of America; and it may find a market by means of the circulation of that trade which was originally put into motion by the &s;urplus produce of America.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="195">
THOSE great events may even have contributed to increa&s;e the enjoyments, and to augment the indu&s;try of countries which, not only never &s;ent any commodities to America, but never received any from it. Even &s;uch countries may have received a greater abun|dance of other commodities from countries of which the &s;urplus produce had been augmented by means of the American trade. This greater abundance, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have increa&s;ed their enjoyments, &s;o it mu&s;t likewi&s;e have augmented their indu&s;try. A greater number of new equivalents of &s;ome kind or other mu&s;t have been pre&s;ented to them to be exchanged for the &s;urplus produce of that indu&s;try. A more exten&s;ive market mu&s;t have been created for that &s;urplus produce, &s;o as to rai&s;e its value, and thereby encourage its increa&s;e. The ma&s;s of commodities annu|ally thrown into the great circle of European commerce, and by its various revolutions annually di&s;tributed among all the different nations comprehended within it, mu&s;t have been augmented by the whole &s;urplus produce of America. A greater &s;hare of this greater ma&s;s, therefore, is likely to have fallen to each of tho&s;e nations, to have increa&s;ed their enjoyments, and augmented their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE exclu&s;ive trade of the mother countries tends to dimini&s;h, or, at lea&s;t, to keep down below what they would otherwi&s;e ri&s;e to, both the enjoyments and indu&s;try of all tho&s;e nations in general, and of the American colonies in particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of one of the great &s;prings which puts into mo|tion a great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind. By rendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries it le&s;&s;ens its con&s;ump|tion, and thereby cramps the indu&s;try of the colonies, and both the enjoyments and the indu&s;try of all other countries, which both enjoy le&s;s when they pay more for what they enjoy, and produce le&s;s when they get le&s;s for what they produce. By rendering the produce of all other countries dearer in the colonies, it cramps,
<PB N="193" REF="196">
in the &s;ame manner, the indu&s;try of all other countries, and both the enjoyments and the indu&s;try of the colonies. It is a clog which, for the &s;uppo&s;ed benefit of &s;ome particular countries, em|barra&s;&s;es the plea&s;ures, and encumbers the indu&s;try of all other countries; but of the colonies more than of any other. It only excludes, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all other countries from one parti|cular market; but it confines, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the colonies to one particular market: and the difference is very great between being excluded from one particular market, when all others are open, and being confined to one particular market, when all others are &s;hut up. The &s;urplus produce of the colonies, however, is the original &s;ource of all that increa&s;e of enjoyments and indu&s;try which Europe derives from the di&s;covery and colonization of Ame|rica; and the exclu&s;ive trade of the mother countries tends to render this &s;ource much le&s;s abundant than it otherwi&s;e would be.</P>
<P>THE particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from the colonies which particularly belong to it, are of two diffe|rent kinds; fir&s;t, tho&s;e common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces &s;ubject to its dominion; and, &s;econdly, tho&s;e peculiar advantages which are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from pro|vinces of &s;o very peculiar a nature as the European colonies of America.</P>
<P>THE common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces, &s;ubject to its dominion, con&s;i&s;t, fir&s;t, in the military force which they furni&s;h for its defence; and, &s;econdly, in the revenue which they furni&s;h for the &s;upport of its civil govern|ment. The Roman colonies furni&s;hed occa&s;ionally both the one and the other. The Greek colonies, &s;ometimes, furni&s;hed a mili|tary force; but &s;eldom any revenue. They &s;eldom acknowledged them&s;elves &s;ubject to the dominion of the mother city. They were generally her allies in war, but very &s;eldom her &s;ubjects in peace.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197">
THE European colonies of America have never yet furni&s;hed any military force for the defence of the mother country. Their military force has never yet been &s;ufficient for their own defence; and in the different wars in which the mother countries have been engaged, the defence of their colonies has generally occa&s;ioned a very con&s;iderable di&s;traction of the military force of tho&s;e countries. In this re&s;pect, therefore, all the European colonies have, without exception, been a cau&s;e rather of weakne&s;s than of &s;trength to their re&s;pec|tive mother countries.</P>
<P>THE colonies of Spain and Portugal only have contributed any revenue towards the defence of the mother country, or the &s;up|port of her civil government. The taxes which have been levied upon tho&s;e of other European nations, upon tho&s;e of England in particular, have &s;eldom been equal to the expence laid out upon them in time of peace, and never &s;ufficient to defray that which they occa&s;ioned in time of war. Such colonies, therefore, have been a &s;ource of expence and not of revenue to their re&s;pective mother countries.</P>
<P>THE advantages of &s;uch colonies to their re&s;pective mother countries, con&s;i&s;t altogether in tho&s;e peculiar advantages which are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from provinces of &s;o very peculiar a nature as the European colonies of America; and the exclu&s;ive trade, it is acknowledged, is the &s;ole &s;ource of all tho&s;e peculiar advantages.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this exclu&s;ive trade, all that part of the &s;urplus produce of the Engli&s;h colonies, for example, which con&s;i&s;ts in what are called enumerated commodities, can be &s;ent to no other country but England. Other countries mu&s;t after|wards buy it of her. It mu&s;t be cheaper therefore in England than it can be in any other country, and mu&s;t contribute more to
<PB N="195" REF="198">
increa&s;e the enjoyments of England, than tho&s;e of any other country. It mu&s;t likewi&s;e contribute more to encourage her in|du&s;try. For all tho&s;e parts of her own &s;urplus produce which England exchanges for tho&s;e enumerated commodities, &s;he mu&s;t get a better price than any other country can get for the like parts of theirs when they exchange them for the &s;ame commodities. The manufactures of England, for example, will purcha&s;e a greater quantity of the &s;ugar and tobacco of her own colonies, than the like manufactures of other countries can purcha&s;e of that &s;ugar and tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England and tho&s;e of other countries are both to be exchanged for the &s;ugar and tobacco of the Engli&s;h colonies, this &s;uperiority of price gives an encouragement to the former, beyond what the latter can in the&s;e circum&s;tances enjoy. The exclu&s;ive trade of the colonies, there|fore, as it dimini&s;hes, or, at lea&s;t, keeps down below what they would otherwi&s;e ri&s;e to, both the enjoyments and the indu&s;try of the countries which do not po&s;&s;e&s;s it; &s;o it gives an evident advantage to the countries which do po&s;&s;e&s;s it over tho&s;e other countries.</P>
<P>THIS advantage, however, will, perhaps, be found to be rather what may be called a relative than an ab&s;olute advantage; and to give a &s;uperiority to the country which enjoys it, rather by depre&s;|&s;ing the indu&s;try and produce of other countries, than by rai&s;ing tho&s;e of that particular country above what they would naturally ri&s;e to in the ca&s;e of a free trade.</P>
<P>THE tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of the monopoly which England enjoys of it, certainly comes cheaper to England than it can do to France, to whom England commonly &s;ells a con&s;iderable part of it. But had France, and all other European countries been, at all times, allowed a free trade
<PB N="196" REF="199">
to Maryland and Virginia, the tobacco of tho&s;e colonies might, by this time, have come cheaper than it actually does, not only to all tho&s;e other countries, but likewi&s;e to England. The produce of tobacco, in con&s;equence of a market &s;o much more exten&s;ive than any which it has hitherto enjoyed, might, and probably would, by this time, have been &s;o much increa&s;ed as to reduce the profits of a tobacco plantation to their natural level with tho&s;e of a corn planta|tion, which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, they are &s;till &s;omewhat above. The price of tobacco might, and probably would, by this time, have fallen &s;omewhat lower than it is at pre&s;ent. An equal quantity of the commodities either of England, or of tho&s;e other countries, might have purcha&s;ed in Maryland and Virginia a greater quantity of tobacco than it can do at pre&s;ent, and, con&s;equently, have been &s;old there for &s;o much a better price. So far as that weed, there|fore, can, by its cheapne&s;s and abundance, increa&s;e the enjoyments or augment the indu&s;try either of England or of any other country, it would, probably, in the ca&s;e of a free trade, have produced both the&s;e effects in &s;omewhat a greater degree than it can do at pre&s;ent. England, indeed, would not in this ca&s;e have had any advantage over other countries. She might have bought the tobacco of her colonies &s;omewhat cheaper, and, con&s;equently, have &s;old &s;ome of her own commodities &s;omewhat dearer than &s;he actually does. But &s;he could neither have bought the one cheaper nor &s;old the other dearer than any other country might have done. She might, perhaps, have gained an ab&s;olute, but &s;he would certainly have lo&s;t a relative advantage.</P>
<P>IN order, however, to obtain this relative advantage in the colony trade, in order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding as much as po&s;&s;ible other nations from any &s;hare in it, England, there are very probable rea&s;ons for believing, has not only &s;acrificed a part of the ab&s;olute advantage which &s;he,
<PB N="197" REF="200">
as well as every other nation, might have derived from that trade, but has &s;ubjected her&s;elf both to an ab&s;olute and to a relative di&s;ad|vantage in almo&s;t every other branch of trade.</P>
<P>WHEN, by the act of navigation, England a&s;&s;umed to her&s;elf the monopoly of the colony trade, the foreign capitals which had before been employed in it were nece&s;&s;arily withdrawn from it. The Engli&s;h capital, which had before carried on but a part of it, was now to carry on the whole. The capital which had before &s;upplied the colonies with but a part of the goods which they wanted from Europe, was now all that was employed to &s;upply them with the whole. But it could not &s;upply them with the whole, and the goods with which it did &s;upply them were nece&s;&s;arily &s;old very dear. The capital which had before bought but a part of the &s;urplus produce of the colonies, was now all that was employed to buy the whole. But it could not buy the whole at any thing near the old price, and, therefore, whatever it did buy it nece&s;&s;arily bought very cheap. But in an employment of capital in which the merchant &s;old very dear and bought very cheap, the profit mu&s;t have been very great, and much above the ordinary level of profit in other branches of trade. This &s;uperiority of profit in the colony trade, could not fail to draw from other branches of trade a part of the capital which had before been employed in them. But this revul&s;ion of capital, as it mu&s;t have gradually increa&s;ed the competition of capitals in the colony trade, &s;o it mu&s;t have gradually dimini&s;hed that competition in all tho&s;e other branches of trade; as it mu&s;t have gradually lowered the profits of the one, &s;o it mu&s;t have gradually rai&s;ed tho&s;e of the other, till the profits of all came to a new level, different from and &s;omewhat higher than that at which they had been before.</P>
<P>THIS double effect, of drawing capital from all other trades, and of rai&s;ing the rate of profit &s;omewhat higher than it otherwi&s;e would
<PB N="198" REF="201">
have been in all trades, was not only produced by this monopoly upon its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, but has continued to be produced by it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>FIRST, this monopoly has been continually drawing capital from all other trades to be employed in that of the colonies.</P>
<P>THOUGH the wealth of Great Britain has increa&s;ed very much &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the act of navigation, it certainly has not increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion as that of the colonies. But the foreign trade of every country naturally increa&s;es in proportion to its wealth, its &s;urplus produce in proportion to its whole produce; and Great Britain having engro&s;&s;ed to her&s;elf almo&s;t the whole of what may be called the foreign trade of the colonies, and her capital not having increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion as the extent of that trade, &s;he could not carry it on without continually withdrawing from other branches of trade &s;ome part of the capital which had before been employed in them, as well as with-holding from them a great deal more which would otherwi&s;e have gone to them. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the act of navigation, accordingly, the colony trade has been continually increa&s;ing, while many other branches of foreign trade, particularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been continually decaying. Our manufactures for foreign &s;ale, in&s;tead of being &s;uited, as before the act of navigation, to the neighbouring market of Europe, or to the more di&s;tant one of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea, have, the greater part of them, been accommodated to the &s;till more di&s;tant one of the colonies, to the market in which they have the monopoly, rather than to that in which they have many competitors. The cau&s;es of decay in other branches of foreign trade, which, by Sir Matthew Decker and other writers, have been &s;ought for in the exce&s;s and improper mode of taxation, in the high price of labour, in the
<PB N="199" REF="202">
increa&s;e of luxury, &amp;c. may all be found in the over-growth of the colony trade. The mercantile capital of Great Britain, though very great, yet not being infinite; and though greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince the act of navigation, yet not being increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion as the colony trade, that trade could not po&s;&s;ibly be carried on without withdrawing &s;ome part of that capital from other branches of trade, nor con&s;equently without &s;ome decay of tho&s;e other branches.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, was a great trading country, her mercantile capital was very great and likely to become &s;till greater and greater every day, not only before the act of naviga|tion had e&s;tabli&s;hed the monopoly of the colony trade, but before that trade was very con&s;iderable. In the Dutch war, during the government of Cromwel, her navy was &s;uperior to that of Hol|land; and in that which broke out in the beginning of the reign of Charles II. it was at lea&s;t equal, perhaps &s;uperior, to the united navies of France and Holland. Its &s;uperiority, perhaps, would &s;carce appear greater in the pre&s;ent times; at lea&s;t if the Dutch navy was to bear the &s;ame proportion to the Dutch com|merce now which it did then. But this great naval power could not, in either of tho&s;e wars, be owing to the act of navigation. During the fir&s;t of them the plan of that act had been but ju&s;t formed; and though before the breaking out of the &s;econd it had been fully enacted by legal authority; yet no part of it could have had time to produce any con&s;iderable effect, and lea&s;t of all that part which e&s;tabli&s;hed the exclu&s;ive trade to the colonies. Both the colonies and their trade were incon&s;iderable then in com|pari&s;on of what they are now. The i&s;land of Jamaica was an unwhole&s;ome de&s;art, little inhabited and le&s;s cultivated. New York and New Jer&s;ey were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch: the half of St. Chri&s;topher's in that of the French. The i&s;land of
<PB N="200" REF="203">
Antigua, the two Carolinas, Pen&s;ylvania, Georgia, and Nova Scotia, were not planted. Virginia, Maryland, and New Eng|land were planted; and though they were very thriving colonies, yet there was not, perhaps, at that time either in Europe or America a &s;ingle per&s;on who fore&s;aw or even &s;u&s;pected the rapid progre&s;s which they have &s;ince made in wealth, population and improvement. The i&s;land of Barbadoes, in &s;hort, was the only Briti&s;h colony of any con&s;equence of which the condition at that time bore any re&s;emblance to what it is at pre&s;ent. The trade of the colonies, of which England, even for &s;ome time after the act of navigation, enjoyed but a part (for the act of navigation was not very &s;trictly executed till &s;everal years after it was enacted) could not at that time be the cau&s;e of the great trade of England, nor of the great naval power which was &s;upported by that trade. The trade which at that time &s;upported that great naval power was the trade of Europe, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea. But the &s;hare which Great Britain at pre|&s;ent enjoys of that trade could not &s;upport any &s;uch great naval power. Had the growing trade of the colonies been left free to all nations, whatever &s;hare of it might have fallen to Great Bri|tain, and a very con&s;iderable &s;hare would probably have fallen to her, mu&s;t have been all an addition to this great trade of which &s;he was before in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In con&s;equence of the monopoly, the increa&s;e of the colony trade has not &s;o much occa&s;ioned an addition to the trade which Great Britain had before, as a total change in its direction.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, this monopoly has nece&s;&s;arily contributed to keep up the rate of profit in all the different branches of Briti&s;h trade higher than it naturally would have been, had all nations been allowed a free trade to the Briti&s;h colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204">
THE monopoly of the colony trade, as it nece&s;&s;arily drew to|wards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would have gone to it of its own accord; &s;o by the expul&s;ion of all foreign capitals it nece&s;&s;arily reduced the whole quantity of capital employed in that trade below what it naturally would have been in the ca&s;e of a free trade. But, by le&s;&s;ening the competition of capitals in that branch of trade, it nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;ed the rate of the profit in that branch. By le&s;&s;en|ing too the competition of Briti&s;h capitals in all other branches of trade, it nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;ed the rate of Briti&s;h profit in all tho&s;e other branches. Whatever may have been, at any particular period, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the act of navigation, the &s;tate or extent of the mercantile capital of Great Britain, the monopoly of the colony trade mu&s;t, during the continuance of that &s;tate, have rai&s;ed the ordinary rate of Briti&s;h profit higher than it other|wi&s;e would have been both in that and in all the other branches of Briti&s;h trade. If, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the act of naviga|tion, the ordinary rate of Briti&s;h profit has fallen con&s;iderably, as it certainly has, it mu&s;t have fallen &s;till lower, had not the mo|nopoly e&s;tabli&s;hed by that act contributed to keep it up.</P>
<P>BUT whatever rai&s;es in any country the ordinary rate of profit higher than it otherwi&s;e would be, nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjects that country both to an ab&s;olute and to a relative di&s;advantage in every branch of trade of which &s;he has not the monopoly.</P>
<P>IT &s;ubjects her to an ab&s;olute di&s;advantage: becau&s;e in &s;uch branches of trade her merchants cannot get this greater profit, without &s;elling dearer than they otherwi&s;e would do both the goods of foreign countries which they import into their own, and the goods of their own country, which they export to fo|reign countries. Their own country mu&s;t both buy dearer and &s;ell dearer; mu&s;t both buy le&s;s and &s;ell le&s;s; mu&s;t both enjoy le&s;s and produce le&s;s than &s;he otherwi&s;e would do.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="205">
IT &s;ubjects her to a relative di&s;advantage; becau&s;e in &s;uch branches of trade it &s;ets other countries which are not &s;ubject to the &s;ame ab&s;olute di&s;advantage either more above her or le&s;s below her than they otherwi&s;e would be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more in proportion to what &s;he enjoys and produces. It renders their &s;uperiority greater or their inferiority le&s;s than it otherwi&s;e would be. By rai&s;ing the price of her produce above what it otherwi&s;e would be, it enables the merchants of other countries to under&s;ell her in foreign markets, and thereby to ju&s;tle her out of almo&s;t all tho&s;e branches of trade, of which &s;he has not the monopoly.</P>
<P>OUR merchants frequently complain of the high wages of Briti&s;h labour as the cau&s;e of their manufactures being under&s;old in foreign markets; but they are &s;ilent about the high profits of &s;tock. They complain of the extravagant gain of other people; but they &s;ay nothing of their own. The high profits of Briti&s;h &s;tock, however, may contribute towards rai&s;ing the price of Briti&s;h manufactures in many ca&s;es as much, and in &s;ome perhaps more than the high wages of Briti&s;h labour.</P>
<P>IT is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may ju&s;tly &s;ay, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part of the different branches of trade of which &s;he has not the monopoly; from the trade of Europe in particular, and from that of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea.</P>
<P>IT has partly been drawn from tho&s;e branches of trade; by the attraction of &s;uperior profit in the colony trade in con&s;equence of the continual increa&s;e of that trade, and of the continual in|&s;ufficiency of the capital which had carried it on one year to carry it on the next.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="206">
IT has partly been driven from them; by the advantage which the high rate of profit, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great Britain, gives to other countries, in all the different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the monopoly.</P>
<P>As the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from tho&s;e other branches a part of the Briti&s;h capital which would other|wi&s;e have been employed in them, &s;o it has forced into them many foreign capitals which would never have gone to them, had they not been expelled from the colony trade. In tho&s;e other branches of trade it has dimini&s;hed the competition of Briti&s;h capitals, and thereby rai&s;ed the rate of Briti&s;h profit higher than it otherwi&s;e would have been. On the contrary, it has increa&s;ed the competition of foreign capitals, and thereby &s;unk the rate of foreign profit lower than it otherwi&s;e would have been. Both in the one way and in the other it mu&s;t evidently have &s;ubjected Great Britain to a relative di&s;advantage in all tho&s;e other branches of trade.</P>
<P>THE colony trade, however, it may perhaps be &s;aid, is more advantageous to Great Britain than any other; and the mono|poly, by forcing into that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would otherwi&s;e have gone to it, has turned that capital into an employment more advantage|ous to the country than any other which it could have found.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t advantageous employment of any capital to the country to which it belongs, is that which maintains there the greate&s;t quantity of productive labour, and increa&s;es the mo&s;t the annual produce of the land and labour of that coun|try. But the quantity of productive labour which any capital employed in the foreign trade of con&s;umption can main|tain is exactly in proportion, it has been &s;hewn in the &s;econd book, to the frequency of its returns. A capital of a thou&s;and
<PB N="204" REF="207">
pounds, for example, employed in a foreign trade of con&s;ump|tion, of which the returns are made regularly once in the year, can keep in con&s;tant employment in the country to which it belongs a quantity of productive labour equal to what a thou|&s;and pounds can maintain there for a year. If the returns are made twice or thrice in the year it can keep in con&s;tant employ|ment a quantity of productive labour equal to what two or three thou&s;and pounds can maintain there for a year. A foreign trade of con&s;umption carried on with a neighbouring country is upon this account in general more advantageous than one carried on with a di&s;tant country; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on a direct foreign trade of con&s;umption, as it has likewi&s;e been &s;hewn in the &s;econd book, is in general more advantageous than a round|about one.</P>
<P>BUT the monopoly of the colony trade, &s;o far as it has operated upon the employment of the capital of Great Britain, has in all ca&s;es forced &s;ome part of it from a foreign trade of con&s;umption carried on with a neighbouring country; to one carried on with a more di&s;tant country, and in many ca&s;es from a direct foreign trade of con&s;umption to a round-about one.</P>
<P>FIRST, the monopoly of the colony trade has in all ca&s;es forced &s;ome part of the capital of Great Britain from a foreign trade of con&s;umption carried on with a neighbouring to one car|ried on with a more di&s;tant country.</P>
<P>IT has, in all ca&s;es, forced &s;ome part of that capital from the trade with Europe, and with the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea, to that with the more di&s;tant regions of Ame|rica and the We&s;t Indies, from which the returns are nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s frequent, not only on account of the greater di&s;tance, but on
<PB N="205" REF="208">
account of the peculiar circum&s;tances of tho&s;e countries. New colonies, it has already been ob&s;erved, are always under&s;tocked. Their capital is always much le&s;s than what they could employ with great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultiva|tion of their land. They have a con&s;tant demand, therefore, for more capital than they have of their own; and, in order to &s;up|ply the deficiency of their own, they endeavour to borrow as much as they can of the mother country, to whom they are, therefore, always in debt. The mo&s;t common way in which the coloni&s;ts contract this debt, is not by borrowing upon bond of the rich people of the mother country, though they &s;ometimes do this too, but by running as much in arrear to their corre&s;pondents, who &s;upply them with goods from Europe, as tho&s;e corre&s;pondents will allow them. Their annual returns frequently do not amount to more than a third, and &s;ometimes not to &s;o great a proportion of what they owe. The whole capital, therefore, which their corre&s;pondents advance to them is &s;eldom returned to Britain in le&s;s than three, and &s;ometimes not in le&s;s than four or five years. But a Briti&s;h capital of a thou&s;and pounds, for example, which is returned to Great Britain only once in five years, can keep in con&s;tant employ|ment only one-fifth part of the Briti&s;h indu&s;try which it could maintain if the whole was returned once in the year; and, in&s;tead of the quantity of indu&s;try which a thou&s;and pounds could main|tain for a year, can keep in con&s;tant employment the quantity only which two hundred pounds can maintain for a year. The planter, no doubt, by the high price which he pays for the goods from Eu|rope, by the intere&s;t upon the bills which he grants at di&s;tant dates; and by the commi&s;&s;ion upon the renewal of tho&s;e which he grants at near dates, makes up, and probably more than makes up, all the lo&s;s which his corre&s;pondent can &s;u&s;tain by this delay. But, though he may make up the lo&s;s of his corre&s;pondent, he cannot make up that of Great Britain. In a trade of which the returns
<PB N="206" REF="209">
are very di&s;tant, the profit of the merchant may be as great or greater than in one in which they are very frequent and near; but the advantage of the country in which he re&s;ides, the quantity of productive labour con&s;tantly maintained there, the annual produce of the land and labour mu&s;t always be much le&s;s. That the returns of the trade to America, and &s;till more tho&s;e of that to the We&s;t Indies, are, in general, not only more di&s;tant, but more irregular, and more uncertain too, than tho&s;e of the trade to any part of Europe, or even of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea, will readily be allowed, I imagine, by every body who has any experience of tho&s;e different branches of trade.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, the monopoly of the colony trade has, in many ca&s;es, forced &s;ome part of the capital of Great Britain from a direct foreign trade of con&s;umption, into a round-about one.</P>
<P>AMONG the enumerated commodities which can be &s;ent to no other market but Great Britain, there are &s;everal of which the quantity exceeds very much the con&s;umption of Great Britain, and of which a part, therefore, mu&s;t be exported to other countries. But this cannot be done without forcing &s;ome part of the capital of Great Britain into a round-about foreign trade of con&s;umption. Maryland and Virginia, for example, &s;end annually to Great Bri|tain upwards of ninety-&s;ix thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco, and the con&s;umption of Great Britain is &s;aid not to exceed fourteen thou&s;and. Upwards of eighty-two thou&s;and hog&s;heads, therefore, mu&s;t be exported to other countries, to France, to Holland, and to the countries which lie round the Baltick and Mediterranean &s;eas. But, that part of the capital of Great Britain which brings tho&s;e eighty-two thou&s;and hog&s;heads to Great Britain, which re-exports them from thence to tho&s;e other countries, and which brings back from tho&s;e other countries to Great Britain either goods or money
<PB N="207" REF="210">
in return, is employed in a round-about foreign trade of con&s;ump|tion; and is nece&s;&s;arily forced into this employment in order to di&s;po&s;e of this great &s;urplus. If we would compute in how many years the whole of this capital is likely to come back to Great Bri|tain, we mu&s;t add to the di&s;tance of the American returns that of the returns from tho&s;e other countries. If, in the direct foreign trade of con&s;umption which we carry on with America, the whole capital employed frequently does not come back in le&s;s than three or four years; the whole capital employed in this round-about one is not likely to come back in le&s;s than four or five. If the one can keep in con&s;tant employment but a third or a fourth part of the dome&s;tick indu&s;try which could be maintained by a capital returned once in the year, the other can keep in con&s;tant employment but a fourth or a fifth part of that indu&s;try. But, had not the colonies been confined to the market of Great Britain for the &s;ale of their tobacco, very little more of it would probably have come to us than what was nece&s;&s;ary for the home con&s;umption. The goods which Great Britain purcha&s;es at pre&s;ent for her own con&s;umption with the great &s;urplus of tobacco which &s;he exports to other coun|tries, &s;he would, in this ca&s;e, probably have purcha&s;ed with the immediate produce of her own indu&s;try, or with &s;ome part of her own manufactures. That produce, tho&s;e manufactures, in&s;tead of being almo&s;t entirely &s;uited to one great market, as at pre&s;ent, would probably have been fitted to a great number of &s;maller mar|kets. In&s;tead of one great round-about foreign trade of con&s;ump|tion, Great Britain would probably have carried on a great num|ber of &s;mall direct foreign trades of the &s;ame kind. On account of the frequency of the returns, a part, and, probably, but a &s;mall part; perhaps not above a third or a fourth, of the capital which at pre&s;ent carries on this great round-about trade, might have been &s;ufficient to carry on all tho&s;e &s;mall direct ones, might have kept in con&s;tant employment an equal quantity of Briti&s;h indu&s;try, and
<PB N="208" REF="211">
have equally &s;upported the annual produce of the land and labour of Great Britain. All the purpo&s;es of this trade being, in this manner, an&s;wered by a much &s;maller capital, there would have been a large &s;pare capital to apply to other purpo&s;es; to improve the lands, to increa&s;e the manufactures, and to extend the com|merce of Great Britain; to come into competition at lea&s;t with the other Briti&s;h capitals employed in all tho&s;e different ways, to reduce the rate of profit in them all, and thereby to give to Great Britain, in all of them, a &s;uperiority over other countries &s;till greater than what &s;he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE monopoly of the colony trade too has forced &s;ome part of the capital of Great Britain from all foreign trade of con|&s;umption to a carrying trade; and, con&s;equently, from &s;upporting more or le&s;s the indu&s;try of Great Britain, to be employed alto|gether in &s;upporting partly that of the colonies, and partly that of &s;ome other countries.</P>
<P>THE goods, for example, which are annually purcha&s;ed with the great &s;urplus of eighty-two thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco annu|ally re-exported from Great Britain, are not all con&s;umed in Great Britain. Part of them, linen from Germany and Holland, for example, is returned to the colonies for their particular con&s;ump|tion. But, that part of the capital of Great Britain which buys the tobacco with which this linen is afterwards bought, is nece&s;|&s;arily withdrawn from &s;upporting the indu&s;try of Great Britain, to be employed altogether in &s;upporting partly that of the colo|nies, and partly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the produce of their own indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE monopoly of the colony trade be&s;ides, by forcing towards it a much greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than
<PB N="209" REF="212">
what would naturally have gone to it, &s;eems to have broken alto|gether that natural balance which would otherwi&s;e have taken place among all the different branches of Briti&s;h indu&s;try. The indu|&s;try of Great Britain, in&s;tead of being accommodated to a great number of &s;mall markets, has been principally &s;uited to one great market. Her commerce, in&s;tead of running in a great number of &s;mall channels, has been taught to run principally in one great channel. But the whole &s;y&s;tem of her indu&s;try and commerce has thereby been rendered le&s;s &s;ecure; the whole &s;tate of her body politick le&s;s healthful than it otherwi&s;e would have been. In her pre&s;ent condition, Great Britain re&s;embles one of tho&s;e unwhol|&s;ome bodies in which &s;ome of the vital parts are overgrown; and which, upon that account, are liable to many dangerous di&s;|orders &s;carce incident to tho&s;e in which all the parts are more pro|perly proportioned. A &s;mall &s;top in that great blood ve&s;&s;el, which has been artificially &s;welled beyond its natural dimen&s;ions, and through which an unnatural proportion of the indu&s;try and com|merce of the country has been forced to circulate, is very likely to bring on the mo&s;t dangerous di&s;orders upon the whole body poli|tick. The expectation of a rupture with the colonies, accordingly, has &s;truck the people of Great Britain with more terror than they ever felt for a Spani&s;h armada or a French inva&s;ion. It was this terror, whether well or ill grounded, which rendered the repeal of the &s;tamp act a popular mea&s;ure, among the merchants at lea&s;t. In the total exclu&s;ion from the colony market, was it to la&s;t only for a few years, the greater part of our merchants u&s;ed to fancy that they fore&s;aw an entire &s;top to their trade; the greater part of our ma&s;ter manufacturers, the entire ruin of their bu&s;ine&s;s; and the greater part of our workmen an end of their employment. A rupture with any of our neighbours upon the continent, though likely too to occa&s;ion &s;ome &s;top or interruption in the employments of &s;ome of all the&s;e different orders of people, is fore&s;een, however, without
<PB N="210" REF="213">
any &s;uch general emotion. The blood, of which the circulation is &s;topt in &s;ome of the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, ea&s;ily di&s;gorges it&s;elf into the greater, without occa&s;ioning any dangerous di&s;order; but, when it is &s;topt in any of the greater ve&s;&s;els, convul&s;ions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and unavoidable con&s;equences. If but one of tho&s;e overgrown manufactures, which, by means either of bounties, or of the monopoly of the home and colony markets, have been artificially rai&s;ed up to an unnatural height, finds &s;ome &s;mall &s;top or interruption in its employment, it frequently occa|&s;ions a mutiny and di&s;order alarming to government, and embar|ra&s;&s;ing even to the deliberations of the legi&s;lature. How great, therefore, would be the di&s;order and confu&s;ion, it was thought, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be occa&s;ioned by a &s;udden and entire &s;top in the employment of &s;o great a proportion of our principal manu|facturers?</P>
<P>SOME moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to Great Britain the exclu&s;ive trade to the colonies, till it is rendered in a great mea&s;ure free, &s;eems to be the only expedient which can deliver her from this danger, which can enable her or even force her to withdraw &s;ome part of her capital from this overgrown employ|ment, and to turn it, though with le&s;s profit, towards other employments; and which, by gradually dimini&s;hing one branch of her indu&s;try and gradually increa&s;ing all the re&s;t, can by degrees re&s;tore all the different branches of it to that natural, healthful and proper proportion which perfect liberty nece&s;&s;arily e&s;tabli&s;hes, and which perfect liberty can alone pre&s;erve. To open the colony trade all at once to all nations, might not only occa&s;ion &s;ome tran&s;itory inconveniency, but a great permanent lo&s;s to the greater part of tho&s;e who&s;e indu&s;try or capital is at pre&s;ent engaged in it. The &s;udden lo&s;s of the employment even of the &s;hips which import the eighty-two thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco, which are over and
<PB N="211" REF="214">
above the con&s;umption of Great Britain, might alone be felt very &s;en&s;ibly. Such are the unfortunate effects of all the regulations of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem! They not only introduce very dangerous di&s;orders into the &s;tate of the body politic, but di&s;orders which it is often difficult to remedy, without occa&s;ioning for a time, at lea&s;t, &s;till greater di&s;orders. In what manner, therefore, the colony trade ought gradually to be opened; what are the re&s;traints which ought fir&s;t, and what are tho&s;e which ought la&s;t to be taken away; or in what manner the natural &s;y&s;tem of perfect liberty and ju&s;tice ought gradually to be re&s;tored, we mu&s;t leave to the wi&s;dom of future &s;tate&s;men and legi&s;lators to determine.</P>
<P>FIVE different events, unfore&s;een and unthought of, have very fortunately concurred to hinder Great Britain from feeling, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as it was generally expected &s;he would, the total exclu&s;ion which has now taken place for more than a year (from the fir&s;t of December, 1774) from a very important branch of the colony trade, that of the twelve a&s;&s;ociated provinces of North America. Fir&s;t, tho&s;e colonies in preparing them&s;elves for their non-impor|tation agreement, drained Great Britain compleatly of all the com|modities which were fit for their market: &s;econdly, the extraordi|nary demand of the Spani&s;h Flota has, this year, drained Germany and the north of many commodities, linen in particular, which u&s;ed to come into competition, even in the Briti&s;h market, with the manufactures of Great Britain: thirdly, the peace between Ru&s;|&s;ia and Turkey has occa&s;ioned an extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which, during the di&s;tre&s;s of the country, and while a Ru&s;&s;ian fleet was cruizing in the Archipelago, had been very poorly &s;upplied: fourthly, the demand of the north of Eu|rope for the manufactures of Great Britain, has been increa&s;ing from year to year for &s;ome time pa&s;t: and, fifthly, the late parti|tion and con&s;equential pacification of Poland, by opening the mar|ket
<PB N="212" REF="215">
of that great country, have this year added an extraordinary demand from thence to the increa&s;ing demand of the north. The&s;e events are all, except the fourth, in their nature tran&s;itory and accidental, and the exclu&s;ion from &s;o important a branch of the colony trade, if unfortunately it &s;hould continue much longer, may &s;till occa&s;ion &s;ome degree of di&s;tre&s;s. This di&s;tre&s;s, however, as it will come on gradually, will be felt much le&s;s &s;everely than if it had come on all at once; and, in the mean time, the indu&s;try and capital of the country may find a new employment and direction, &s;o as to prevent it from ever ri&s;ing to any con&s;iderable height.</P>
<P>THE monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, &s;o far as it has turned towards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would otherwi&s;e have gone to it, has in all ca&s;es turned it, from a foreign trade of con&s;umption with a neigh|buring, into one with a more di&s;tant country; in many ca&s;es, from a direct foreign trade of con&s;umption, into a round-about one; and in &s;ome ca&s;es, from all foreign trade of con&s;umption, into a carrying trade. It has in all ca&s;es, therefore, turned it, from a direction in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of productive labour, into one, in which it can maintain a much &s;maller quantity. By &s;uiting, be&s;ides, to one particular market only &s;o great a part of the indu&s;try and commerce of Great Britain, it has rendered the whole &s;tate of that indu&s;try and commerce more precarious and le&s;s &s;ecure, than if their produce had been accom|modated to a greater variety of markets.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the effects of the colony trade and tho&s;e of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and nece&s;&s;arily beneficial; the latter always and nece&s;&s;arily hurtful. But the former are &s;o beneficial, that the colony trade, though &s;ubject to a monopoly, and notwith&s;tanding the hurtful effects of that
<PB N="213" REF="216">
monopoly, is &s;till upon the whole beneficial, and greatly beneficials though a good deal le&s;s &s;o than it otherwi&s;e would be.</P>
<P>THE effect of the colony trade in its natural and free &s;tate, is to open a great, though di&s;tant market for &s;uch parts of the produce of Briti&s;h indu&s;try as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer home, of tho&s;e of Europe and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean &s;ea. In its natural and free &s;tate the colony trade, without drawing from tho&s;e markets any part of the produce which had ever been &s;ent to them, encourages Great Britain to increa&s;e the &s;urplus continually, by continually pre&s;enting new equivalents to be exchanged for it. In its natural and free &s;tate, the colony trade tends to increa&s;e the quantity of productive labour in Great Britain, but without altering in any re&s;pect the direction of that which had been employed there before. In the natural and free &s;tate of the colony trade, the competition of all other nations would hinder the rate of profit from ri&s;ing above the common level either in the new market, or in the new employment. The new market, without drawing any thing from the old one, would create, if one may &s;ay &s;o, a new produce for its own &s;upply; and that new produce would con&s;titute a new capital for carrying on the new employment which in the &s;ame manner would draw nothing from the old one.</P>
<P>THE monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the competition of other nations, and thereby rai&s;ing the rate of profit both in the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the old market and capital from the old employment. To augment our &s;hare of the colony trade beyond what it other|wi&s;e would be, is the avowed purpo&s;e of the monopoly. If our &s;hare of that trade were to be no greater with, than it would have been without the monopoly, there could have been no rea&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing the monopoly. But whatever forces into a branch of

trade of which the returns are &s;lower and more di&s;tant than tho&s;e of the greater part of other trades, a greater proportion of the capital of any country, than what of its own accord would go to that branch, nece&s;&s;arily renders the whole quantity of productive labour annually maintained there, the whole annual produce of the land and labour of that country le&s;s than they otherwi&s;e would be.

<P>THE natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than counter-balance to Great Britain the bad effects of the mono|poly, &s;o that, monopoly and all together, that trade, even as it is carried on at pre&s;ent, is not only advantageous, but greatly advan|tageous. The new market and new employment which are opened by the colony trade, are of much greater extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employment which is lo&s;t by the monopoly. The new produce and the new capital which has been created, if one may &s;ay &s;o, by the colony trade, maintain in Great Britain a greater quantity of productive labour, than what can have been thrown out of employment by the revul&s;ion of capital from other trades of which the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, however, even as it is carried on at pre&s;ent is advan|tageous to Great Britain, it is not by means of the monopoly, but in &s;pite of the monopoly.</P>
<P>IT is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe, that the colony trade opens a new market. Agricul|ture
<PB N="215" REF="218">
is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of all new colonies; a bu&s;ine&s;s which, the cheapne&s;s of land renders more advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, in the rude produce of land, and in&s;tead of importing it from other countries, they have generally a large &s;urplus to export. In new colonies, agriculture, either draws hands from all other employments, or keeps them from going to any other employment. There are few hands to &s;pare for the nece&s;&s;ary, and none for the ornamental manufactures. The greater part of the manufactures of both kinds, they find it cheaper to purcha&s;e of other countries than to make for them&s;elves. It is chiefly by encouraging the manufactures of Europe, that the colony trade indirectly encourages its agriculture. The manufac|turers of Europe to whom that trade gives employment con&s;titute a new market for the produce of the land; and the mo&s;t advanta|geous of all markets, the home market, for the corn and cattle, for the bread and butcher's-meat of Europe, is thus greatly extended by means of the trade to America.</P>
<P>BUT that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies is not alone &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h, or even to maintain manufactures in any country, the examples of Spain and Portugal &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate. Spain and Portugal were manufacturing countries before they had any con&s;iderable colonies. Since they had the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fertile in the world they have both cea&s;ed to be &s;o.</P>
<P>IN Spain and Portugal, the bad effects of the monopoly, aggra|vated by other cau&s;es, have entirely conquered the natural good effects of the colony trade. The&s;e cau&s;es &s;eem to be, other mono|polies of different kinds; the degradation of the value of gold and &s;ilver below what it is in mo&s;t other countries; the exclu&s;ion from foreign markets by improper taxes upon exportation, and the
<PB N="216" REF="219">
narrowing of the home market, by &s;till more improper taxes upon the tran&s;portation of goods from one part of the country to another; but above all, that irregular and partial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pur&s;uit of his injured creditor, and which makes the indu&s;trious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for the con&s;umption of tho&s;e haughty and great men, to whom they dare not refu&s;e to &s;ell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of re-payment.</P>
<P>IN England, on the contrary, the natural good effects of the colony trade, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other cau&s;es, have in a great mea&s;ure conquered the bad effects of the monopoly. The&s;e cau&s;es &s;eem to be, the general liberty of trade, which, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome re&s;traints is at lea&s;t equal, perhaps &s;uperior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of exporting, duty free, almo&s;t all &s;orts of goods which are the produce of dome&s;tick indu&s;try, to almo&s;t any foreign country, and what, perhaps, is of &s;till greater import|ance, the unbounded liberty of tran&s;porting them from any one part of our own country to any other, without being obliged to give any account to any publick office, without being liable to que&s;tion or examination of any kind; but above all, that equal and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice which renders the rights of the meane&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ubject re&s;pectable to the greate&s;t, and which, by &s;ecuring to every man the fruits of his own indu&s;try, gives the greate&s;t and mo&s;t effectual encouragement to every &s;ort of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IF the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been ad|vanced, as they certainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means of the monopoly of that trade, but in &s;pite of the monopoly. The effect of the monopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the quality and &s;hape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to accommodate to a
<PB N="217" REF="220">
market, from which the returns are &s;low and di&s;tant, what would otherwi&s;e have been accommodated to one from which the returns are frequent and near. Its effect has con&s;equently been to turn a part of the capital of Great Britain from an employment in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of manu|facturing indu&s;try, to one in which it maintains a much &s;maller, and thereby to dimini&s;h, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, the whole quantity of manufacturing indu&s;try maintained in Great Britain.</P>
<P>THE monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, like all the other mean and malignant expedients of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, depre&s;&s;es the indu&s;try of all other countries, but chiefly that of the colonies, without in the lea&s;t increa&s;ing, but on the con|trary dimini&s;hing that of the country in who&s;e favour it is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE monopoly hinders the capital of that country, whatever may at any particular time be the extent of that capital, from maintaining &s;o great a quantity of productive labour as it would otherwi&s;e maintain, and from affording &s;o great a revenue to the indu&s;trious inhabitants as it would otherwi&s;e afford. But as capital can be increa&s;ed only by &s;avings from revenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording &s;o great a revenue as it would otherwi&s;e afford, nece&s;&s;arily hinders it from increa&s;ing &s;o fa&s;t as it would otherwi&s;e increa&s;e, and con&s;equently from maintaining a &s;till greater quantity of productive labour, and affording a &s;till greater revenue to the indu&s;trious inhabitants of that coun|try. One great original &s;ource of revenue, therefore, the wages of labour, the monopoly mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have rendered at all timesle&s;s abundant than it otherwi&s;e would have been.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="221">
BY rai&s;ing the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly di&s;cou|rages the improvement of land. The profit of improvement de|pends upon the difference between what the land actually produces and what, by the application of a certain capital, it can be made to produce. If this difference affords a greater profit than what can be drawn from an equal capital in any mercantile employ|ment, the improvement of land will draw capital from all mer|cantile employments. If the profit is le&s;s, mercantile employments will draw capital from the improvement of land. Whatever there|fore rai&s;es the rate of mercantile profit, either le&s;&s;ens the &s;upe|riority or increa&s;es the inferiority of the profit of improvement; and in the one ca&s;e hinders capital from going to improvement, and in the other draws capital from it. But by di&s;couraging im|provement, the monopoly nece&s;&s;arily retards the natural increa&s;e of another great original &s;ource of revenue, the rent of land. By rai&s;ing the rate of profit too the monopoly nece&s;&s;arily keeps up the market rate of intere&s;t higher than it otherwi&s;e would be. But the price of land in proportion to the rent which it affords, the number of years purcha&s;e which is commonly paid for it, nece&s;&s;arily falls as the rate of intere&s;t ri&s;es, and ri&s;es as the rate of intere&s;t falls. The monopoly therefore hurts the intere&s;t of the landlord two different ways, by retarding the natural increa&s;e, fir&s;t, of his rent, and &s;econdly, of the price which he would get for his land in proportion to the rent which it affords.</P>
<P>THE monopoly, indeed, rai&s;es the rate of mercantile profit, and thereby augments &s;omewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it ob&s;tructs the natural increa&s;e of capital, it tends rather to dimini&s;h than to increa&s;e the &s;um total of the revenue which the inhabitants of the country derive from the profits of &s;tock; a &s;mall profit upon a great capital generally affording a greater revenue than a great profit upon a &s;mall one. The monopoly
<PB N="219" REF="222">
rai&s;es the rate of profit, but it hinders the &s;um of profit from ri&s;ing &s;o high as it otherwi&s;e would do.</P>
<P>ALL the original &s;ources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of land, and the profits of &s;tock, the monopoly renders much le&s;s abundant than they otherwi&s;e would be. To promote the little intere&s;t of one little order of men in one country, it hurts the intere&s;t of all other orders of men in that country, and of all men in all other countries.</P>
<P>IT is &s;olely by rai&s;ing the ordinary rate of profit that the mo|nopoly either has proved or could prove advantageous to any one particular order of men. But be&s;ides all the bad effects to the country in general which have already been mentioned as nece&s;|&s;arily re&s;ulting from a high rate of profit; there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all the&s;e put together, but which, if we may judge from experience, is in&s;eparably connected with it. The high rate of profit &s;eems every where to de&s;troy that par&s;imony which in other circum&s;tances is natural to the character of the merchant. When profits are high, that &s;ober virtue &s;eems to be &s;uperfluous, and expen&s;ive luxury to &s;uit better the affluence of his &s;ituation. But the owners of the great mercantile capitals are nece&s;&s;arily the leaders and conductors of the whole indu&s;try of every nation, and their example has a much greater influence upon the manners of the whole indu&s;trious part of it than that of any other order of men. If his employer is attentive and par&s;imonious, the workman is very likely to be &s;o too; but if the ma&s;ter is di&s;&s;olute and di&s;orderly, the &s;ervant who &s;hapes his work according to the pattern which his ma&s;ter pre&s;cribes to him, will &s;hape his life too according to the example which he &s;ets him. Accumulation is thus prevented in the hands of all tho&s;e who are naturally the mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to accumulate; and the funds
<PB N="220" REF="223">
de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour receive no aug|mentation from the revenue of tho&s;e who ought naturally to augment them the mo&s;t. The capital of the country, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, gradually dwindles away, and the quantity of produc|tive labour maintained in it grows every day le&s;s and le&s;s. Have the exorbitant profits of the merchants of Cadiz and Li&s;bon aug|mented the capital of Spain and Portugal? Have they alleviated the poverty, have they promoted the indu&s;try of tho&s;e two beg|garly countries? Such has been the tone of mercantile expence in tho&s;e two trading cities, that tho&s;e exorbitant profits, far from augmenting the general capital of the country, &s;eem &s;carce to have been &s;ufficient to keep up the capitals upon which they were made. Foreign capitals are every day intruding them&s;elves, if I may &s;ay &s;o, more and more into the trade of Cadiz and Li&s;bon. It is to expel tho&s;e foreign capitals from a trade which their own capital grows every day more and more in&s;ufficient for carrying on, that the Spaniards and Portugueze endeavour every day to &s;traiten more and more the galling bands of their ab&s;urd monopoly. Compare the mercantile manners of Cadiz and Li&s;bon with tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam, and you will be &s;en&s;ible how differently the con|duct and character of merchants are affected by the high and by the low profits of &s;tock. The merchants of London indeed have not yet generally become &s;uch magnificent lords as tho&s;e of Cadiz and Li&s;bon; but neither are they in general &s;uch attentive and par&s;imonious burghers as tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam. They are &s;up|po&s;ed, however, many of them, to be a good deal richer than the greater part of the former, and not quite &s;o rich as many of the latter. But the rate of their profit is commonly much lower than that of the former, and a good deal higher than that of the latter. Light come light go, &s;ays the proverb; and the ordinary tone of expence &s;eems every where to be regulated, not &s;o much according to the real ability of &s;pending, as to the &s;uppo&s;ed facility of getting money to &s;pend.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="224">
IT is thus that the &s;ingle advantage which the monopoly pro|cures to a &s;ingle order of men is in many different ways hurtful to the general intere&s;t of the country.</P>
<P>TO found a great empire for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing up a people of cu&s;tomers, may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear a project fit only for a nation of &s;hopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of &s;hopkeepers; but extremely fit for a nation that is governed by &s;hopkeepers. Such &s;overeigns, and &s;uch &s;o|vereigns only, are capable of fancying that they will find &s;ome advantage in employing the blood and trea&s;ure of their &s;ubjects, to found and to maintain &s;uch an empire. Say to a &s;hopkeeper, Buy me a good e&s;tate, and I &s;hall always buy my cloaths at your &s;hop, even though I &s;hould pay &s;omewhat dearer than what I can have them for at other &s;hops; and you will not find him very forward to embrace your propo&s;al. But &s;hould any other per&s;on buy you &s;uch an e&s;tate, the &s;hopkeeper would be much obliged to your bene|factor if he would enjoin you to buy all your cloaths at his &s;hop. England purcha&s;ed for &s;ome of her &s;ubjects, who found them|&s;elves unea&s;y at home, a great e&s;tate in a di&s;tant country. The price indeed was very &s;mall, and in&s;tead of thirty years purcha&s;e, the ordinary price of land in the pre&s;ent times, it amounted to little more than the expence of the different equipments which made the fur&s;t di&s;covery, reconnoitered the coa&s;t, and took a fictitious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. The land was good and of great ex|tent, and the cultivators having plenty of good ground to work upon, and being for &s;ome time at liberty to &s;ell their produce where they plea&s;ed, became in the cour&s;e of little more than thirty or forty years (between 1620 and 1660) &s;o numer|ous and thriving a people, that the &s;hopkeepers and other traders of England wi&s;hed to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the monopoly of their cu&s;tom. Without pretending, therefore, that they had paid any part, either of the original purcha&s;e money, or of the
<PB N="222" REF="225">
&s;ub&s;equent expence of improvement, they petitioned the parlia|ment that the cultivators of America might for the future be confined to their &s;hop; fir&s;t, for buying all the goods which tey wanted from Europe; and, &s;econdly, for &s;elling all &s;uch parts of their own produce as tho&s;e traders might find it convenient to buy. For they did not find it convenient to buy every part of it. Some parts of it imported into England might have inter|fered with &s;ome of the trades which they them&s;elves carried on at home. Tho&s;e particular parts of it, therefore, they were willing that the coloni&s;ts &s;hould &s;ell where they could; the farther off the better; and upon that account propo&s;ed that their market &s;hould be confined to the countries &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre. A clau&s;e in the famous act of navigation e&s;tabli&s;hed this truly &s;hopkeeper propo&s;al into a law.</P>
<P>THE maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the prin|cipal, or more properly perhaps the &s;ole end and purpo&s;e of the dominion which Great Britain a&s;&s;umes over her colonies. In the exclu&s;ive trade, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ts the great advantage of pro|vinces, which have never yet afforded either revenue or military force for the &s;upport of the civil government, or the defence of the mother country. The monopoly is the principal badge of their dependency, and it is the &s;ole fruit which has hitherto been gathered from that dependency. Whatever expence Great Britain has hitherto laid out in maintaining this dependency, has really been laid out in order to &s;upport this monopoly. The expence of the ordinary peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colonies amounted, before the commencement of the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances, to the pay of twenty regiments of foot; to the expence of the artillery, &s;tores, and extra|ordinary provi&s;ions with which it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply them; and to the expence of a very con&s;iderable naval force which is con|&s;tantly kept up in order to guard, from the &s;muggling ve&s;&s;els of
<PB N="223" REF="226">
other nations, the immen&s;e coa&s;t of North America, and that of our We&s;t Indian i&s;lands. The whole expence of this peace e&s;tabli&s;hment was a charge upon the revenue of Great Britain, and was, at the &s;ame time, the &s;malle&s;t part of what the dominion of the colonies has co&s;t the mother country. If we would know the amount of the whole, we mu&s;t add to the annual expence of this peace e&s;tabli&s;hment the intere&s;t of the &s;ums which, in con&s;equence of her con&s;idering her colonies as provinces &s;ubject to her domi|nion, Great Britain has upon different occa&s;ions laid out upon their defence. We mu&s;t add to it, in particular, the whole expence of the late war, and a great part of that which preceeded it. The late war was altogether a colony quarrel, and the whole expence of it, in whatever part of the world it may have been laid out, whether in Germany or in the Ea&s;t Indies, ought ju&s;tly to be &s;tated to the account of the colonies. It amounted to more than ninety millions &s;terling, including not only the new debt which was contracted, but the two &s;hillings in the pound additional land tax, and the &s;ums which were every year borrowed from the &s;inking fund. The Spani&s;h war which began in 1739, was principally a colony quarrel. Its principal object was to prevent the &s;earch of the colony &s;hips which carried on a contraband trade with the Spani&s;h main. This whole expence is, in reality, a bounty which has been given in order to &s;upport a monopoly. The pretended purpo&s;e of it was to encourage the manufactures, and to encrea&s;e the commerce of Great Britain. But its real effect has been to rai&s;e the rate of mercantile profit, and to enable our merchants to turn into a branch of trade, of which the returns are more &s;low and di&s;tant than tho&s;e of the greater part of other trades, a greater proportion of their capital than they otherwi&s;e would have done; two events which, if a bounty could have prevented, it might perhaps have been very well worth while to give &s;uch a bounty.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="227">
UNDER the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of management, therefore, Great Bri|tain derives nothing but lo&s;s from the dominion which &s;he a&s;&s;umes over her colonies.</P>
<P>To propo&s;e that Great Britain &s;hould voluntarily give up all authority over her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magi|&s;trates, to enact their own laws, and to make peace and war as they might think proper, would be to propo&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure as never was, and never will be adopted, by any nation in the world. No nation ever voluntarily gave up the dominion of any province, how trouble&s;ome &s;oever it might be to govern it, and how &s;mall &s;oever the revenue which it afforded might be in proportion to the expence which it occa&s;ioned. Such &s;acrifices, though they might frequently be agreeable to the intere&s;t, are always mortifying to the pride of every nation, and what is perhaps of &s;till greater con&s;equence, they are always contrary to the private intere&s;t of the governing part of it, who would thereby be deprived of the di&s;|po&s;al of many places of tru&s;t and profit, of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and di&s;tinction, which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t turbulent, and, to the great body of the people, the mo&s;t unpro|fitable province &s;eldom fails to afford. The mo&s;t vi&s;ionary enthu|&s;ia&s;t would &s;carce be capable of propo&s;ing &s;uch a mea&s;ure, with any &s;erious hopes at lea&s;t of its ever being adopted. If it was adopt|ed, however, Great Britain would not only be immediately freed from the whole annual expence of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colonies, but might &s;ettle with them &s;uch a treaty of commerce as would effectually &s;ecure to her a free trade, more advantageous to the great body of the people, though le&s;s &s;o to the merchants, than the monopoly which &s;he at pre&s;ent enjoys. By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of the colonies to the mother country, which, perhaps, our late di&s;&s;en&s;ions have well nigh extingui&s;hed, would quickly revive. It might di&s;po&s;e them not only to re&s;pect,
<PB N="225" REF="228">
for whole centuries together, that treaty of commerce which they had concluded with us at parting, but to favour us in war as well as in trade, and, in&s;tead of turbulent and factious &s;ubjects, to become our mo&s;t faithful, affectionate, and generous allies; and the &s;ame &s;ort of parental affection on the one &s;ide, and filial re&s;pect on the other, might revive between Great Britain and her colonies, which u&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between tho&s;e of ancient Greece and the mother city from which they de&s;cended.</P>
<P>IN order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which it belongs, it ought to afford, in time of peace, a revenue to the publick &s;ufficient not only for defraying the whole expence of its own peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, but for contributing its proportion to the &s;upport of the general government of the empire. Every pro|vince nece&s;&s;arily contributes, more or le&s;s, to increa&s;e the expence of that general government. If any particular province, there|fore, does not contribute its &s;hare towards defraying this expence, an unequal burden mu&s;t be thrown upon &s;ome other part of the empire. The extraordinary revenue too which every province affords to the publick in time of war, ought, from parity of rea&s;on, to bear the &s;ame proportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire which its ordinary revenue does in time of peace. That neither the ordinary nor extraordinary revenue which Great Britain derives from her colonies, bears this proportion to the whole revenue of the Briti&s;h empire, will readily be allowed. The monopoly, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed, by increa&s;ing the private revenue of the people of Great Britain, and thereby enabling them to pay greater taxes, compen&s;ates the deficiency of the publick revenue of the colonies. But this monopoly, I have endeavoured to &s;how, though a very grievous tax upon the colonies, and though it may increa&s;e the revenue of a particular order of men in Great Britain, dimi|ni&s;hes in&s;tead of increa&s;ing that of the great body of the people; and con&s;equently dimini&s;hes in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the ability of the great
<PB N="226" REF="229">
body of the people to pay taxes. The men too who&s;e revenue the monopoly increa&s;es, con&s;titute a particular order which it is both ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to tax beyond the proportion of other orders, and extremely impolitick even to attempt to tax beyond that propor|tion, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how in the following book. No particular re&s;ource, therefore, can be drawn from this particular order.</P>
<P>THE colonies may be taxed either by their own a&s;&s;emblies or by the parliament of Great Britain.</P>
<P>THAT the colony a&s;&s;emblies can ever be &s;o managed as to levy upon their con&s;tituents a publick revenue &s;ufficient not only to maintain at all times their own civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, but to pay their proper proportion of the expence of the general govern|ment of the Briti&s;h empire, &s;eems not very probable. It was a long time before even the parliament of England, though placed immediately under the eye of the &s;overeign, could be brought under &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of management, or could be rendered &s;ufficiently liberal in their grants for &s;upporting the civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hments even of their own country. It was only by di&s;tributing among the parti|cular members of parliament, a great part either of the offices, or of the di&s;po&s;al of the offices ari&s;ing from this civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of management could be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed even with regard to the parliament of England. But the di&s;tance of the colony a&s;&s;emblies from the eye of the &s;overeign, their number, their di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation, and their various con&s;titutions, would render it very difficult to manage them in the &s;ame manner, even though the &s;overeign had the &s;ame means of doing it; and tho&s;e means are wanting. It would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tribute among all the leading members of all the colony a&s;&s;emblies &s;uch a &s;hare, either of the offices or of the di&s;po&s;al of the offices ari&s;ing
<PB N="227" REF="230">
from the general government of the Briti&s;h empire, as to di&s;po&s;e them to give up their popularity at home and to tax their con&s;tituents for the &s;upport of that general government, of which almo&s;t the whole emoluments were to be divided among people who were &s;trangers to them. The unavoidable ignorance of admini&s;tration, be&s;ides, concerning the relative importance of the different mem|bers of tho&s;e different a&s;&s;emblies, the offences which mu&s;t frequently be given, the blunders which mu&s;t con&s;tantly be committed in attempting to manage them in this manner, &s;eem to render &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of management altogether impracticable with regard to them.</P>
<P>THE colony a&s;&s;emblies, be&s;ides, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed the proper judges of what is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence and &s;upport of the whole empire. The care of that defence and &s;upport is not intru&s;ted to them. It is not their bu&s;ine&s;s, and they have no regular means of information concerning it. The a&s;&s;embly of a province, like the ve&s;try of a pari&s;h, may judge very properly concerning the affairs of its own particular di&s;trict; but can have no proper means of judging concerning tho&s;e of the whole empire. It cannot even judge properly concerning the proportion which its own province bears to the whole empire; or concerning the relative degree of its wealth and importance, compared with the other provinces; becau&s;e tho&s;e other provinces are not under the in&s;pection and &s;uper-intendancy of the a&s;&s;embly of a particular province. What is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence and &s;upport of the whole empire, and in what proportion each part ought to contribute, can be judged of only by that a&s;&s;em|bly which in&s;pects and &s;uper-intends the affairs of the whole empire.</P>
<P>IT has been propo&s;ed, accordingly, that the colonies &s;hould be taxed by requi&s;ition, the parliament of Great Britain determining the &s;um which each colony ought to pay, and the provincial a&s;&s;embly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="228" REF="231">
and levying it in the way that &s;uited be&s;t the circum&s;tances of the province. What concerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the a&s;&s;embly which in&s;pects and &s;uper-intends the affairs of the whole empire; and the provincial affairs of each colony might &s;till be regulated by its own a&s;&s;embly. Though the colonies &s;hould in this ca&s;e have no repre&s;entatives in the Briti&s;h parliament, yet, if we may judge by experience, there is no probability that the parliamen|tary requi&s;ition would be unrea&s;onable. The parliament of England has not upon any occa&s;ion &s;hown the &s;malle&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to over|burden tho&s;e parts of the empire which are not repre&s;ented in parliament. The i&s;lands of Guern&s;ey and Jer&s;ey, without any means of re&s;i&s;ting the authority of parliament, are more lightly taxed than any part of Great Britain. Parliament in attempting to exerci&s;e its &s;uppo&s;ed right, whether well or ill grounded, of taxing the colonies, has never hitherto demanded of them any thing which even approached to a ju&s;t proportion to what was paid by their fellow &s;ubjects at home. If the contribution of the colonies, be&s;ides, was to ri&s;e or fall in proportion to the ri&s;e or fall of the land tax; parliament could not tax them without taxing at the &s;ame time its own con&s;tituents, and the colonies might in this ca&s;e be con&s;i|dered as virtually repre&s;ented in parliament.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES are not wanting of empires in which all the different provinces are not taxed, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, in one ma&s;s; but in which the &s;overeign regulates the &s;um which each province ought to pay, and in &s;ome provinces a&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and levies it as he thinks proper; while in others, he leaves it to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and levied as the re&s;pective &s;tates of each province &s;hall determine. In &s;ome provinces of France, the king not only impo&s;es what taxes he thinks proper, but a&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and levies them in the way he thinks proper. From others he demands a certain &s;um, but leaves it to the &s;tates of each province to a&s;&s;e&s;s and levy that &s;um as they think
<PB N="229" REF="232">
proper. According to the &s;cheme of taxing by requi&s;ition, the parliament of Great Britain would &s;tand nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation towards the colony a&s;&s;emblies, as the king of France does towards the &s;tates of tho&s;e provinces which &s;till enjoy the privilege of having &s;tates of their own, the provinces of France which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t governed.</P>
<P>BUT though, according to this &s;cheme, the colonies could have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear that their &s;hare of the publick burdens &s;hould ever exceed the proper proportion to that of their fellow citizens at home; Great Britain might have ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear that it never would amount to that proper proportion. The parliament of Great Britain has not for &s;ome time pa&s;t had the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hed authority in the colonies, which the French king has in tho&s;e provinces of France, which &s;till enjoy the privilege of having &s;tates of their own. The colony a&s;&s;emblies, if they were not very favour|ably di&s;po&s;ed (and unle&s;s more &s;kilfully managed than they ever have been hitherto, they are not very likely to be &s;o) might &s;till find many pretences for evading or rejecting the mo&s;t rea&s;onable requi&s;itions of parliament. A French war breaks out, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e; ten millions mu&s;t immediately be rai&s;ed in order to defend the &s;eat of the empire. This &s;um mu&s;t be borrowed upon the credit of &s;ome parliamentary fund mortgaged for paying the intere&s;t. Part of this fund parliament propo&s;es to rai&s;e by a tax to be levied in Great Britain, and part of it by a requi&s;ition to all the different colony a&s;&s;em|blies of America and the We&s;t Indies. Would people readily advance their money upon the credit of a fund, which partly depended upon the good humour of all tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, far di&s;tant from the &s;eat of the war, and &s;ometimes, perhaps, thinking them&s;elves not much con|cerned in the event of it? Upon &s;uch a fund no more money would probably be advanced than what the tax to be levied in Great Britain might be &s;uppo&s;ed to an&s;wer for. The whole burden of the debt
<PB N="230" REF="233">
contracted on account of the war would in this manner fall, as it always has done hitherto, upon Great Britain, upon a part of the empire and not upon the whole empire. Great Britain is, perhaps, &s;ince the world began, the only &s;tate which, as it has extended its empire, has only increa&s;ed its expence without once augmenting its re&s;ources. Other &s;tates have generally di&s;burdened them&s;elves upon their &s;ubject and &s;ubordinate provinces of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the expence of defending the empire. Great Britain has hitherto &s;uffered her &s;ubject and &s;ubordinate provinces to di&s;burden them&s;elves upon her of almo&s;t this whole expence. In order to put Great Britain upon a footing of equality with her own colonies, which the law has hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ubject and &s;ubordinate, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, upon the &s;cheme of taxing them by parliamentary requi&s;ition, that parliament &s;hould have &s;ome means of rendering its requi&s;itions immediately effec|tual in ca&s;e the colony a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould attempt to evade or reject them; and what tho&s;e means are, it is not very ea&s;y to conceive, and it has not yet been explained.</P>
<P>SHOULD the parliament of Great Britain, at the &s;ame time, be ever fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the right of taxing the colonies, even independent of the con&s;ent of their own a&s;&s;emblies, the impor|tance of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies would from that moment be at an end, and with it that of all the leading men of Briti&s;h America. Men de&s;ire to have &s;ome &s;hare in the management of public affairs chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them. Upon the power which the greater part of the leading men, the natural ari&s;tocracy of every country, have of pre&s;erving or defending their re&s;pective importance, depends the &s;tability and duration of every &s;y&s;tem of free government. In the attacks which tho&s;e leading men are continually making upon the importance of one another, and in the defence of their own, con&s;i&s;ts the whole play
<PB N="231" REF="234">
of dome&s;tic faction and ambition. The leading men of America, like tho&s;e of all other countries, de&s;ire to pre&s;erve their own im|portance. They feel, or imagine that if their a&s;&s;emblies, which they are fond of calling parliaments, and of con&s;idering as equal in authority to the parliament of Great Britain, &s;hould be &s;o far degraded as to become the humble mini&s;ters and executive officers of that parliament, the greater part of their own importance would be at an end. They have rejected, therefore, the propo&s;al of being taxed by parliamentary requi&s;ition, and like other ambitious and high &s;pirited men, have rather cho&s;en to draw the &s;word in defence of their own importance.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the declen&s;ion of the Roman republic, the allies of Rome, who had born the principal burden of defending the &s;tate and extending the empire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens. Upon being refu&s;ed, the &s;ocial war broke out. During the cour&s;e of that war Rome granted tho&s;e privileges to the greater part of them, one by one, and in pro|portion as they detached them&s;elves from the general confederacy. The parliament of Great Britain in&s;i&s;ts upon taxing the colonies; and they refu&s;e to be taxed by a parliament in which they are not repre&s;ented. If to each colony, which &s;hould detach it&s;elf from the general confederacy, Great Britain &s;hould allow &s;uch a number of repre&s;entatives as &s;uited the proportion of what it contributed to the public revenue of the empire, in con&s;equence of its being &s;ubjected to the &s;ame taxes, and in compen&s;ation admitted to the &s;ame freedom of trade with its fellow &s;ubjects at home; the num|ber of its repre&s;entatives to be augmented as the proportion of its contribution might afterwards augment; a new method of acquir|ing importance, a new and more dazzling object of ambition would be pre&s;ented to the leading men of each colony. In&s;tead of piddling for the little prizes which are to be found in what
<PB N="232" REF="235">
may be called the paltry raffle of colony faction; they might then hope, from the pre&s;umption which men naturally have in their own ability and good fortune, to draw &s;ome of the great prizes which &s;ometimes come from the wheel of the great &s;tate lottery of Briti&s;h politics. Unle&s;s this or &s;ome other method is fallen upon, and there &s;eems to be none more obvious than this, of pre&s;erving the importance and of gratifying the ambition of the leading men of America, it is not very probable that they will ever voluntarily &s;ubmit to us; and we ought to con&s;ider that the blood which mu&s;t be &s;hed in forcing them to do &s;o, is every drop of it, the blood either of tho&s;e who are, or of tho&s;e whom we wi&s;h to have for our fellow citizens. They are very weak who flatter them&s;elves that, in the &s;tate to which things have come, our colonies will be ea&s;ily conquered by force alone. The per&s;ons who now govern the re&s;olutions of what they call their continental congre&s;s, feel in them&s;elves at this moment a degree of importance which, perhaps, the greate&s;t &s;ubjects in Europe &s;carce feel. From &s;hopkeepers, trade&s;men, and attornies, they are become &s;tate&s;|men and legi&s;lators, and are employed in contriving a new form of government for an exten&s;ive empire, which, they flatter them&s;elves, will become, and which, indeed, &s;eems very likely to become one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable that ever was in the world. Five hundred different people, per|haps, who in different ways act immediately under the continental congre&s;s; and five hundred thou&s;and, perhaps, who act under tho&s;e five hundred, all feel in the &s;ame manner a proportionable ri&s;e in their own importance. Almo&s;t every individual of the govern|ing party in America fills, at pre&s;ent, in his own fancy, a &s;tation &s;uperior, not only to what he had ever filled before, but to what he had ever expected to fill; and unle&s;s &s;ome new object of am|bition is pre&s;ented either to him or to his leaders, if he has the ordinary &s;pirit of a man, he will die in defence of that &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="236">
IT is a remark of the pre&s;ident Henaut that we now read with plea&s;ure the account of many little tran&s;actions of the Ligue, which when they happened were not perhaps con&s;idered as very im|portant pieces of news. But every man then, &s;ays he, fancied him&s;elf of &s;ome importance; and the innumerable memoirs which have come down to us from tho&s;e times, were, the greater part of them, written by people who took plea&s;ure in recording and magnifying events in which, they flattered them&s;elves, they had been con&s;iderable actors. How ob&s;tinately the city of Paris upon that occa&s;ion defended it&s;elf, what a dreadful famine it &s;upported rather than &s;ubmit to the be&s;t and afterwards the mo&s;t beloved of all the French kings, is well known. The greater part of the citizens, or tho&s;e who governed the greater part of them, fought in defence of their own importance, which they fore&s;aw was to be at an end whenever the antient government &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. Our colonies, unle&s;s they can be induced to con&s;ent to a union, are very likely to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the be&s;t of all mother countries, as ob&s;tinately as the city of Paris did again&s;t one of the be&s;t of kings.</P>
<P>THE idea of repre&s;entation was unknown in antient times. When the people of one &s;tate were admitted to the right of citizen&s;hip in another, they had no other means of exerci&s;ing that right but by coming in a body to vote and deliberate with the people of that other &s;tate. The admi&s;&s;ion of the greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the privileges of Roman citizens, completely ruined the Roman republic. It was no longer po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h between who was and who was not a Roman citizen. No tribe could know its own members. A rabble of any kind could be introduced into the a&s;&s;emblies of the people, could drive out the real citizens, and decide upon the affairs of the republic as if they them&s;elves had been &s;uch. But though America was to
<PB N="234" REF="237">
&s;end fifty or &s;ixty new repre&s;entatives to parliament, the door|keeper of the hou&s;e of commons could not find any great diffi|culty in di&s;tingui&s;hing between who was and who was not a member. Though the Roman con&s;titution, therefore, was nece&s;|&s;arily ruined by the union of Rome with the allied &s;tates of Italy, there is not the lea&s;t probability that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution would be hurt by the union of Great Britain with her colonies. That con&s;titution, on the contrary, would be compleated by it, and &s;eems to be imperfect without it. The a&s;&s;embly which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs of every part of the empire, in order to be properly informed, ought certainly to have repre&s;en|tatives from every part of it. That this union, however, could be ea&s;ily effectuated, or that difficulties and great difficulties might not occur in the execution, I do not pretend. I have yet heard of none, however, which appear in&s;urmountable. The principal perhaps ari&s;e, not from the nature of things, but from the prejudices and opinions of the people both on this and the other &s;ide of the Atlantic.</P>
<P>WE, on this &s;ide the water, are afraid le&s;t the multitude of American repre&s;entatives &s;hould over-turn the balance of the con&s;ti|tution, and increa&s;e too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand, or the force of the democracy on the other. But if the number of American repre&s;entatives was to be in pro|portion to the produce of American taxation, the number of people to be managed would increa&s;e exactly in proportion to the means of managing them; and the means of managing, to the number of people to be managed. The monarchical and de|mocratical parts of the con&s;titution would, after the union, &s;tand exactly in the &s;ame degree of relative force with regard to one another as they had done before.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="238">
THE people on the other &s;ide of the water are afraid le&s;t their di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government might expo&s;e them to many oppre&s;&s;ions. But their repre&s;entatives in parliament, of which the number ought from the fir&s;t to be con&s;iderable, would ea&s;ily be able to protect them from all oppre&s;&s;ion. The di&s;tance could not much weaken the dependency of the repre&s;entative upon the con|&s;tituent, and the former would &s;till feel that he owed his &s;eat in parliament and all the con&s;equence which he derived from it to the good will of the latter. It would be the intere&s;t of the for|mer, therefore, to cultivate that good-will by complaining with all the authority of a member of the legi&s;lature, of every outrage which any civil or military officer might be guilty of in tho&s;e remote parts of the empire. The di&s;tance of America from the &s;eat of government, be&s;ides, the nations of that country might flatter them&s;elves, with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on too, would not be of very long continuance. Such has hitherto been the rapid progre&s;s of that country in wealth, population and improve|ment, that in the cour&s;e of little more than a century, per|haps, the produce of American might exceed that of Briti&s;h taxation. The &s;eat of the empire would then naturally remove it&s;elf to that part of the empire which contributed mo&s;t to the general defence and &s;upport of the whole.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of America, and that of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greate&s;t and mo&s;t important events recorded in the hi&s;tory of mankind. Their con|&s;equences have already been very great: but, in the &s;hort period of between two and three centuries which has elap&s;ed &s;ince the&s;e di&s;coveries were made, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the whole extent of their con&s;equences can have been &s;een. What benefits, or what misfortunes to mankind may hereafter re&s;ult from tho&s;e great events no human wi&s;dom can fore&s;ee. By uniting, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the world, by enabling them to relieve one another's
<PB N="236" REF="239">
wants, to increa&s;e one another's enjoyments, and to encourage one another's indu&s;try, their general tendency would &s;eem to be bene|ficial. To the natives, however, both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, all the commercial benefits which can have re&s;ulted from tho&s;e events have been &s;unk and lo&s;t in the dreadful misfortunes which they have occa&s;ioned. The&s;e misfortunes, however, &s;eem to have ari&s;en rather from accident than from any thing in the nature of tho&s;e events them&s;elves. At the particular time when the&s;e di&s;|coveries were made, the &s;uperiority of force happened to be &s;o great on the &s;ide of the Europeans, that they were enabled to com|mit with impunity every &s;ort of inju&s;tice in tho&s;e remote countries. Hereafter, perhaps, the natives of tho&s;e countries may grow &s;tronger, or tho&s;e of Europe may grow weaker, and the inhabitants of all the different quarters of the world may arrive at that equality of courage and force which, by in&s;piring mutual fear, can alone overawe the inju&s;tice of independent nations into &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;pect for the rights of one another. But nothing &s;eems more likely to e&s;tabli&s;h this equality of force than that mutual commu|nication of knowledge and of all &s;orts of improvements which an exten&s;ive commerce from all countries to all countries naturally, or rather nece&s;&s;arily, carries along with it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time one of the principal effects of tho&s;e di&s;cove|ries has been to rai&s;e the mercantile &s;y&s;tem to a degree of &s;plen|dor and glory which it could never otherwi&s;e have attained to. It is the object of that &s;y&s;tem to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactures than by the improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the indu&s;try of the towns than by that of the country. But, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e di&s;coveries, the commer|cial towns of Europe, in&s;tead of being the manufacturers and car|riers for but a very &s;mall part of the world, (that part of Europe which is wa&s;hed by the Atlantic ocean, and the countries which
<PB N="237" REF="240">
lie round the Baltick and Mediterranean &s;eas), have now become the manufacturers for the numerous and thriving cultivators of America, and the carriers, and in &s;ome re&s;pects the manufacturers too, for almo&s;t all the different nations of A&s;ia, Africa, and Ame|rica. Two new worlds have been opened to their indu&s;try, each of them much greater and more exten&s;ive than the old one, and the market of one of them growing &s;till greater and greater every day.</P>
<P>THE countries which po&s;&s;e&s;s the colonies of America, and which trade directly to the Ea&s;t Indies, enjoy, indeed, the whole &s;hew and &s;plendor of this great commerce. Other countries, however, not|with&s;tanding all the invidious re&s;traints by which it is meant to exclude them, frequently enjoy a greater &s;hare of the real benefit of it. The colonies of Spain and Portugal, for example, give more real encouragement to the indu&s;try of other countries than to that of Spain and Portugal. In the &s;ingle article of linen alone the con&s;umption of tho&s;e colonies amounts, it is &s;aid, but I do not pretend to warrant the quantity, to more than three millions &s;ter|ling a year. But this great con&s;umption is almo&s;t entirely &s;up|plied by France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Spain and Portugal furni&s;h but a &s;mall part of it. The capital which &s;upplies the colonies with this great quantity of linen is annually di&s;tri|buted among, and furni&s;hes a revenue to the inhabitants of tho&s;e other countries. The profits of it only are &s;pent in Spain and Portugal, where they help to &s;upport the &s;umptuous profu&s;ion of the merchants of Cadiz and Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>EVEN the regulations by which each nation endeavours to &s;ecure to it&s;elf the exclu&s;ive trade of its own colonies, are frequently more hurtful to the countries in favour of which they are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed than to tho&s;e again&s;t which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed. The
<PB N="238" REF="241">
unju&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion of the indu&s;try of other countries falls back, if I may &s;ay &s;o, upon the heads of the oppre&s;&s;ors, and cru&s;hes their indu&s;try more than it does that of tho&s;e other countries. By tho&s;e regulations, for example, the merchant of Hamburgh mu&s;t &s;end the linen which he de&s;tines for the American market to London, and he mu&s;t bring back from thence the tobacco which he de&s;tines for the German market; becau&s;e he can neither &s;end the one directly to America, nor bring back the other directly from thence. By this re&s;traint he is probably obliged to &s;ell the one &s;omewhat cheaper, and to buy the other &s;omewhat dearer than he otherwi&s;e might have done; and his profits are probably &s;omewhat abridged by means of it. In this trade, however, between Hamburgh and London, he certainly receives the returns of his capital much more quickly than he could po&s;&s;ibly have done in the direct trade to America, even though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, what is by no means the ca&s;e, that the payments of America were as punctual as tho&s;e of London. In the trade, therefore, to which tho&s;e regulations confine the merchant of Hamburgh, his capital can keep in con|&s;tant employment a much greater quantity of German indu&s;try than it po&s;&s;ibly could have done in the trade from which he is excluded. Though the one employment, therefore, may to him perhaps be le&s;s profitable than the other, it cannot be le&s;s advan|tageous to his country. It is quite otherwi&s;e with the employment into which the monopoly naturally attracts, if I may &s;ay &s;o, the capital of the London merchant. That employment may, per|haps, be more profitable to him than the greater part of other employments, but, on account of the &s;lowne&s;s of the returns, it cannot be more advantageous to his country.</P>
<P>AFTER all the unju&s;t attempts, therefore, of every country in Europe to engro&s;s to it&s;elf the whole advantage of the trade of its own colonies, no country has yet been able to engro&s;s to it&s;elf any
<PB N="239" REF="242">
thing but the expence of &s;upporting in time of peace and of defending in time of war the oppre&s;&s;ive authority which it a&s;&s;umes over them. The inconveniencies re&s;ulting from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its colonies, every country has engro&s;&s;ed to it&s;elf completely. The advantages re&s;ulting from their trade it has been obliged to &s;hare with many other countries.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t &s;ight, no doubt, the monopoly of the great commerce of America, naturally &s;eems to be an acqui&s;ition of the highe&s;t value. To the undi&s;cerning eye of giddy ambition, it naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf, amid&s;t the confu&s;ed &s;cramble of politicks and war, as a very dazzling object to fight for. The dazzling &s;plendor of the object, however, the immen&s;e greatne&s;s of the commerce, is the very quality which renders the monopoly of it hurtful, or which makes one employment, in its own nature nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s advan|tageous to the country than the greater part of other employments, ab&s;orb a much greater proportion of the capital of the country than what would otherwi&s;e have gone to it:</P>
<P>THE mercantile &s;tock of every country, it has been &s;hewn in the &s;econd book, naturally &s;eeks, if one may &s;ay &s;o, the employment mo&s;t advantageous to that country. It it is employed in the carrying trade, the country to which it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries who&s;e trade that &s;tock carries on. But the owner of that &s;tock nece&s;&s;arily wi&s;hes to di&s;po&s;e of as great a part of tho&s;e goods as he can at home. He thereby &s;aves him&s;elf the trouble, ri&s;k and expence, of exportation, and he will upon that account be glad to &s;ell them at home, not only for a much &s;maller price, but with &s;omewhat a &s;maller profit than he might expect to make by &s;ending them abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours as much as he can to turn his carrying trade into a foreign trade of con&s;umption. If his &s;tock again is employed in a foreign trade of con&s;umption, he will, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be glad
<PB N="240" REF="243">
to di&s;po&s;e of at home as great a part as he can of the home goods, which he collects in order to export to &s;ome foreign market, and he will thus endeavour as much as he can, to turn his foreign trade of con&s;umption into a home trade. The mercantile &s;tock of every country naturally courts in this manner the near, and &s;huns the di&s;tant employment; naturally courts the employment in which the returns are frequent, and &s;huns that in which they are di&s;tant and &s;low; naturally courts the employment in which it can maintain the greate&s;t quantity of productive labour in the country to which it belongs, or in which its owner re&s;ides, and &s;huns that in which it can maintain there the &s;malle&s;t quantity. It naturally courts the employment which in ordinary ca&s;es is mo&s;t advantageous, and &s;huns that which in ordinary ca&s;es is lea&s;t advan|tageous to that country.</P>
<P>BUT if in any of tho&s;e di&s;tant employments, which in ordinary ca&s;es are le&s;s advantageous to the country, the profit &s;hould happen to ri&s;e &s;omewhat higher than what is &s;ufficient to balance the natural preference which is given to nearer employments, this &s;uperiority of profit will draw &s;tock from tho&s;e nearer employments, till the profits of all return to their proper level. This &s;uperiority of profit, however, is a proof that in the actual circum&s;tances of the &s;ociety, tho&s;e di&s;tant employments are &s;omewhat under&s;tocked in proportion to other employments, and that the &s;tock of the &s;ociety is not di&s;tri|buted in the propere&s;t manner among all the different employments carried on in it. It is a proof that &s;omething is either bought cheaper or &s;old dearer than it ought to be, and that &s;ome particular cla&s;s of citizens is more or le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed either by paying more or by getting le&s;s than what is &s;uitable to that equality, which ought to take place, and which naturally does take place among all the different cla&s;&s;es of them. Though the &s;ame capital never will maintain the &s;ame quantity of productive labour in a di&s;tant as in a near employment, yet a di&s;tant employment may be as nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of the
<PB N="241" REF="244">
&s;ociety as a near one; the goods which the di&s;tant employment deals in being nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if the profits of tho&s;e who deal in &s;uch goods are above their proper level, tho&s;e goods will be &s;old dearer than they ought to be, or &s;omewhat above their natural price, and all tho&s;e engaged in the nearer employments will be more or le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed by this high price. Their intere&s;t, therefore, in this ca&s;e requires that &s;ome &s;tock &s;hould be withdrawn from tho&s;e nearer employments, and turned towards that di&s;tant employment, in order to reduce its profits to their proper level, and the price of the goods which it deals in to their natural price. In this extraordi|nary ca&s;e, the publick intere&s;t requires that &s;ome &s;tock &s;hould be withdrawn from tho&s;e employments which in ordinary ca&s;es are more advantageous, and turned towards one which in ordinary ca&s;es is le&s;s advantageous to the publick: and in this extraordinary ca&s;e, the natural intere&s;ts and inclinations of men coincide as exactly with the publick intere&s;t as in all other ordinary ca&s;es, and lead them to withdraw &s;tock from the near, and to turn it towards the di&s;tant employment.</P>
<P>IT is thus that the private intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of individuals naturally di&s;po&s;e them to turn their &s;tock towards the employments which in ordinary ca&s;es are mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;ociety. Bu if from this natural preference they &s;hould turn too much of it towards tho&s;e employments, the fall of profit in them and the ri&s;e of it in all others immediately di&s;po&s;e them to alter this faulty di&s;tri|bution. Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men naturally lead them to divide and di&s;tribute the &s;tock of every &s;ociety, among all the different employ|ments carried on in it, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible in the proportion which is mo&s;t agreeable to the intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="245">
ALL the different regulations of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, nece&s;&s;arily derange more or le&s;s this natural and mo&s;t advantageous di&s;tribution of &s;tock. But tho&s;e which concern the trade to America and the Ea&s;t Indies derange it perhaps more than any other; becau&s;e the trade to tho&s;e two great continents ab&s;orbs a greater quantity of &s;tock than any two other branches of trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement is effected in tho&s;e two different branches of trade are not altogether the &s;ame. Monopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different &s;ort of monopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, &s;eems to be the &s;ole engine of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN the trade to America every nation endeavours to engro&s;s as much as po&s;&s;ible the whole market of its own colonies, by fairly excluding all other nations from any direct trade to them. During the greater part of the &s;ixteenth century, the Portugueze endeavoured to manage the trade to the Ea&s;t Indies in the &s;ame manner, by claiming the &s;ole right of &s;ailing in the Indian &s;eas, on account of the merit of having fir&s;t found out the road to them. The Dutch &s;till continue to exclude all other European nations from any direct trade to their &s;pice i&s;lands. Monopolies of this kind are evidently e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t all other European nations, who are thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for them to turn &s;ome part of their &s;tock, but are obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in &s;omewhat dearer than if they could import them them&s;elves directly from the countries which produce them.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince the fall of the power of Portugal, no European nation has claimed the exclu&s;ive right of &s;ailing in the Indian &s;eas, of which the principal ports are now open to the &s;hips of all European nations. Except in Portugal, however, and within the&s;e few years in France,
<PB N="243" REF="246">
the trade to the Ea&s;t Indies has in every European country been &s;ubjected to an exclu&s;ive company. Monopolies of this kind are properly e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t the very nation which erects them. The greater part of that nation are thereby, not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for them to turn &s;ome part of their &s;tock, but are obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in, &s;omewhat dearer than if it was open and free to all their countrymen. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company, for example, the other inhabitants of England, over and above being excluded from the trade, mu&s;t have paid in the price of the Ea&s;t India goods which they have con&s;umed, not only for all the extraordinary profits which the company may have made upon tho&s;e goods in con&s;equence of their monopoly, but for all the extraordinary wa&s;te which the fraud and abu&s;e, in&s;eparable from the management of the affairs of &s;o great a company, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have occa&s;ioned. The ab&s;urdity of this &s;econd kind of monopoly, therefore, is much more manife&s;t than that of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e kinds of monopolies derange more or le&s;s the natural di&s;tribution of the &s;tock of the &s;ociety: but they do not always derange it in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>MONOPOLIES of the fir&s;t kind always attract to the particular trade in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, a greater proportion of the &s;tock of the &s;ociety than what would go to that trade of its own accord.</P>
<P>MONOPOLIES of the &s;econd kind may &s;ometimes attract &s;tock towards the particular trade in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;ometimes repel it from that trade according to different circum|&s;tances. In poor countries they naturally attract towards that trade more &s;tock than would otherwi&s;e go to it. In rich countries
<PB N="244" REF="247">
they naturally repel from it a good deal of &s;tock which would otherwi&s;e go to it.</P>
<P>SUCH poor countries as Sweden and Denmark, for example, would probably have never &s;ent a &s;ingle &s;hip to the Ea&s;t Indies, had not the trade been &s;ubjected to an exclu&s;ive company. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of &s;uch a company nece&s;&s;arily encourages adventurers. Their monopoly &s;ecures them again&s;t all competitors in the home market, and they have the &s;ame chance for foreign markets with the traders of other nations. Their monopoly &s;hows them the certainty of a great profit upon a con&s;iderable quantity of goods, and the chance of a con&s;iderable profit upon a great quantity. Without &s;uch extraordinary encouragement, the poor traders of &s;uch poor countries would probably never have thought of hazarding their &s;mall capitals in &s;o very di&s;tant and uncertain an adventure as the trade to the Ea&s;t Indies mu&s;t naturally have appeared to them.</P>
<P>SUCH a rich country as Holland, on the contrary, would pro|bably, in the ca&s;e of a free trade, &s;end many more &s;hips to the Ea&s;t Indies than it actually does. The limited &s;tock of the Dutch Ea&s;t India company probably repels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which would otherwi&s;e go to it. The mer|cantile capital of Holland is &s;o great that it is, as it were, con|tinually overflowing, &s;ometimes into the public funds of foreign countries, &s;ometimes into loans to private traders and adventurers of foreign countries, &s;ometimes into the mo&s;t round about fo|reign trades of con&s;umption, and &s;ometimes into the carrying trade. All near employments being completely filled up, all the capital which can be placed in them with any tollerable profit being already placed in them, the capital of Holland nece&s;&s;arily flows towards the mo&s;t di&s;tant employments. The trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, if it was altogether free, would probably ab&s;orb the
<PB N="245" REF="248">
greater part of this redundant capital. The Ea&s;t Indies offer a market both for the manufactures of Europe and for the gold and &s;ilver as well as for &s;everal other productions of America, greater and more exten&s;ive than both Europe and America put together.</P>
<P>EVERY derangement of the natural di&s;tribution of &s;tock is nece&s;|&s;arily hurtful to the &s;ociety in which it takes place; whether it be by repelling from a particular trade the &s;tock which would other|wi&s;e go to it, or by attracting towards a particular trade that which would not otherwi&s;e come to it. If without any exclu&s;ive company, the trade of Holland to the Ea&s;t Indies would be greater than it actually is, that country mu&s;t &s;uffer a con&s;iderable lo&s;s by part of its capital being excluded from the employment mo&s;t conve|nient for that part. And in the &s;ame manner, if without an exclu|&s;ive company, the trade of Sweden and Denmark to the Ea&s;t Indies would be le&s;s than it actually is, or, what perhaps is more probable, would not exi&s;t at all, tho&s;e two countries mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;uffer a con&s;iderable lo&s;s by part of their capital being drawn into an employ|ment which mu&s;t be more or le&s;s un&s;uitable to their pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances. Better for them, perhaps, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances to buy Ea&s;t India goods of other nations, even though they &s;hould pay &s;omewhat dearer, than to turn &s;o great a part of their &s;mall capital to &s;o very di&s;tant a trade, in which the returns are &s;o very &s;low, in which that capital can maintain &s;o &s;mall a quantity of productive labour at home, where productive labour is &s;o much wanted, where &s;o little is done, and where &s;o much is to do.</P>
<P>THOUGH without an exclu&s;ive company, therefore, a particular country &s;hould not be able to carry on any direct trade to the Ea&s;t Indies, it will not from thence follow that &s;uch a company ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed there, but only that &s;uch a country ought not in
<PB N="246" REF="249">
the&s;e circum&s;tances to trade directly to the Ea&s;t Indies. That &s;uch companies are not in general nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the Ea&s;t India trade, is &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated by the experience of the Portu|gueze, who enjoyed almo&s;t the whole of it for more than a century together without any exclu&s;ive company.</P>
<P>No private merchant, it has been &s;aid, could well have capital &s;ufficient to maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the Ea&s;t Indies, in order to provide goods for the &s;hips which he might occa&s;ionally &s;end thither; and yet, unle&s;s he was able do this, the difficulty of finding a cargo might frequently make his &s;hips lo&s;e the &s;ea&s;on for returning, and the expence of &s;o long a delay would not only eat up the whole profit of the adventure, but frequently occa&s;ion a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s. This argument, however, if it proved any thing at all, would prove that no one great branch of trade could be carried on without an exclu&s;ive company, which is contrary to the experience of all nations. There is no great branch of trade in which the capital of any one private merchant is &s;ufficient for carrying on all the &s;ubordinate branches which mu&s;t be carried on in order to carry on the principal branch. But when a nation is ripe for any great branch of trade, &s;ome merchants naturally turn their capitals towards the principal, and &s;ome towards the &s;ubor|dinate branches of it; and though all the different branches of it are in this manner carried on, yet it very &s;eldom happens that they are all carried on by the capital of one private merchant. If a nation, therefore, is ripe for the Ea&s;t India trade, a certain portion of its capital will naturally divide it&s;elf among all the different branches of that trade. Some of its merchants will find it for their intere&s;t to re&s;ide in the Ea&s;t Indies, and to employ their capitals there in providing goods for the &s;hips which are to be &s;ent out by other merchants who re&s;ide in Europe. The &s;ettlements
<PB N="247" REF="250">
which different European nations have obtained in the Ea&s;t Indies, if they were taken from the exclu&s;ive companies to which they at pre&s;ent belong and put under the immediate protection of the &s;ove|reign, would render this re&s;idence both &s;afe and ea&s;y, at lea&s;t to the merchants of the particular nations to whom tho&s;e &s;ettlements belong. If at any particular time that part of the capital of any country which of its own accord tended and inclined, if I may &s;ay &s;o, towards the Ea&s;t India trade, was not &s;ufficient for carrying on all tho&s;e different branches of it, it would be a proof that at that particular time, that country was not ripe for that trade, and that it would do better to buy for &s;ome time, even at a higher price, from other European nations, the Ea&s;t India goods it had occa&s;ion for, than to import them it&s;elf directly from the Ea&s;t Indies. What it might lo&s;e by the high price of tho&s;e goods &s;eldom be equal to the lo&s;s which it would &s;u&s;tain by the di&s;traction of a large portion of its capital from other employments more nece&s;&s;ary, or more u&s;eful, or more &s;uitable to its circum&s;tances and &s;ituation than a direct trade to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Europeans po&s;&s;e&s;s many con&s;iderable &s;ettlements both upon the coa&s;t of Africa and in the Ea&s;t Indies, they have not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed in either of tho&s;e countries &s;uch numerous and thriving colonies as tho&s;e in the i&s;lands and continent of America Africa, however, as well as &s;everal of the countries comprehended under the general name of the Ea&s;t Indies, are inhabited by barba|rous nations. But tho&s;e nations were by no means &s;o weak and defencele&s;s as the mi&s;erable and helple&s;s Americans; and in propor|tion to the natural fertility of the countries which they inhabited, they were be&s;ides much more populous. The mo&s;t barbarous nations either of Africa or of the Ea&s;t Indies were &s;hepherds; even the Hotentots were &s;o. But the natives of every part of America, except Mexico and Peru, were only hunters; and the difference is
<PB N="248" REF="251">
very great between the number of &s;hepherds and that of hunters whom the &s;ame extent of equally fertile territory can maintain. In Africa and the Ea&s;t Indies, therefore, it was more difficult to di&s;place the natives, and to extend the European plantations over the greater part of the lands of the original inhabitants. The genius of exclu&s;ive com|panies, be&s;ides, is unfavourable, it has already been ob&s;erved, to the growth of new colonies, and has probably been the principal cau&s;e of the little progre&s;s which they have made in the Ea&s;t Indies. The Portugueze carried on the trade both to Africa and the Ea&s;t Indies without any exclu&s;ive companies, and their &s;ettlements at Congo, Angola, and Benguela on the coa&s;t of Africa, and at Goa in the Ea&s;t Indies, though much depre&s;&s;ed by &s;uper&s;tition and every &s;ort of bad government, yet bear &s;ome faint re&s;emblance to the colonies of America, and are partly inhabited by Portugueze who have been e&s;tabli&s;hed there for &s;everal generations. The Dutch &s;ettlements at the Cape of Good Hope and at Batavia, are at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t con&s;iderable colonies which the Europeans have e&s;tabli&s;hed either in Africa or in the Ea&s;t Indies, and both tho&s;e &s;ettlements are pecu|liarly fortunate in their &s;ituation. The Cape of Good Hope was inhabited by a race of people almo&s;t as barbarous and quite as inca|pable of defending them&s;elves as the natives of America. It is be&s;ides the half way-hou&s;e, if one may &s;ay &s;o, between Europe and the Ea&s;t Indies, at which almo&s;t every European &s;hip makes &s;ome &s;tay both in going and returning. The &s;upplying of tho&s;e &s;hips with every &s;ort of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, with fruit and &s;ometimes with wine, affords alone a very exten&s;ive market for the &s;urplus produce of the coloni&s;ts. What the Cape of Good Hope is between Europe and every part of the Ea&s;t Indies, Batavia is between the principal countries of the Ea&s;t Indies. It lies upon the mo&s;t frequented road from Indo&s;tan to China and Japan, and is nearly about mid-way upon that road. Almo&s;t all the &s;hips too that &s;ail between
<PB N="249" REF="252">
Europe and China touch at Batavia; and it is, over and above all this, the center and principal mart of what is called the country trade of the Ea&s;t Indies; not only of that part of it which is car|ried on by Europeans, but of that which is carried on by the native Indians, and ve&s;&s;els navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan; of Tonquin, Malacca, Cochin-China and the i&s;land of Celebes, are frequently to be &s;een in its port. Such advantageous &s;ituations have enabled tho&s;e two colonies to &s;urmount all the ob&s;tacles which the oppre&s;&s;ive genius of an exclu&s;ive company may have occa&s;ionally oppo&s;ed to their growth. They have enabled Batavia to &s;urmount the additional di&s;advantage of perhaps the mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome climate in the world.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h and Dutch companies, though they have e&s;tabli&s;hed no con&s;iderable colonies, except the two above mentioned, have both made con&s;iderable conque&s;ts in the Ea&s;t Indies. But in the man|ner in which they both govern their new &s;ubjects, the natural genius of an exclu&s;ive company has &s;hown it&s;elf mo&s;t di&s;tinctly. In the &s;pice i&s;lands the Dutch burn all the &s;piceries which a fertile &s;ea&s;on produces beyond what they expect to di&s;po&s;e of in Europe with &s;uch a profit as they think &s;ufficient. In the i&s;lands where they have no &s;ettlements, they give a premium to tho&s;e who collect the young blo&s;&s;oms and green leaves of the clove and nutmeg trees which naturally grow there, but which this barbarous policy has now, it is &s;aid, almo&s;t completely extirpated. Even in the i&s;lands where they have &s;ettlements they have very much reduced, it is &s;aid, the number of tho&s;e trees. If the produce even of their own i&s;lands was much greater than what &s;uited their market, the natives, they &s;u&s;pect, might find means to convey &s;ome part of it to other nations; and the be&s;t way, they imagine, to &s;ecure their own monopoly, is to take care that no more &s;hall grow than what they them&s;elves carry to market. By different arts of oppre&s;&s;ion they have reduced the population of &s;everal of the Moluccas nearly to the number which
<PB N="250" REF="253">
is &s;ufficient to &s;upply with fre&s;h provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries of life their own in&s;ignificant garri&s;ons, and &s;uch of their &s;hips as occa&s;ionally come there for a cargo of &s;pices. Under the govern|ment even of the Portugueze, however, tho&s;e i&s;lands are &s;aid to have been tolerably well inhabited. The Engli&s;h company have not yet had time to e&s;tabli&s;h in Bengal &s;o perfectly de&s;tructive a &s;y&s;tem. The plan of their government, however, has had exactly the &s;ame tendency. It has not been uncommon, I am well a&s;&s;ured, for the chief, that is, the fir&s;t clerk of a factory, to order a pea&s;ant to plough up a rich field of poppies, and &s;ow it with rice or &s;ome other grain. The pretence was, to prevent a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions; but the real rea&s;on, to give the chief an opportunity of &s;elling at a better price a large quantity of opium, which he happened then to have upon hand. Upon other occa&s;ions the order has been rever&s;ed; and a rich field of rice or other grain has been ploughed up in order to make room for a plantation of poppies; when the chief fore&s;aw that extraordinary profit was likely to be made by opium. The &s;ervants of the company have upon &s;everal occa&s;ions attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h in their own favour the monopoly of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important branches, not only of the foreign, but of the inland trade of the country. Had they been allowed to go on, it is impo&s;|&s;ible that they &s;hould not at &s;ome time or another have attempted to re&s;train the production of the particular articles of which they had thus u&s;urped the monopoly, not only to the quantity which they them&s;elves could purcha&s;e, but to that which they could expect to &s;ell with &s;uch a profit as they might think &s;ufficient. In the cour&s;e of a century or two, the policy of the Engli&s;h company would in this manner have probably proved as completely de&s;tructive as that of the Dutch.</P>
<P>NOTHING, however, can be more directly contrary to the real intere&s;t of tho&s;e companies, con&s;idered as the &s;overeigns of the countries which they have conquered, than this de&s;tructive plan.
<PB N="251" REF="254">
In almo&s;t all countries the revenue of the &s;overeign is drawn from that of the people. The greater the revenue of the people, there|fore, the greater the annual produce of their land and labour, the more they can afford to the &s;overeign. It is his intere&s;t, therefore, to increa&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible that annual produce. But if this is the intere&s;t of every &s;overeign, it is peculiarly &s;o of one who&s;e revenue, like that of the &s;overeign of Bengal, ari&s;es chiefly from a land-rent. That rent mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in proportion to the quantity and value of the produce, and both the one and the other mu&s;t depend upon the extent of the market. The quantity will always be &s;uited with more or le&s;s exactne&s;s to the con&s;umption of tho&s;e who can afford to pay for it, and the price which they will pay will always be in proportion to the eagerne&s;s of their competition. It is the intere&s;t of &s;uch a &s;overeign, therefore, to open the mo&s;t exten&s;ive market for the produce of his country, to allow the mo&s;t perfect freedom of commerce, in order to increa&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible the number and the competition of buyers; and upon this account to aboli&s;h, not only all monopolies, but all re&s;traints upon the tran&s;portation of the home produce from one part of the country to another, upon its exportation to foreign countries, or upon the importation of goods of any kind for which it can be exchanged. He is in this manner mo&s;t likely to increa&s;e both the quantity and value of that produce, and con&s;equently of his own &s;hare of it, or of his own revenue.</P>
<P>BUT a company of merchants are, it &s;eems, incapable of con&s;ider|ing them&s;elves as &s;overeigns, even after they have become &s;uch. Trade, or buying in order to &s;ell again, they &s;till con&s;ider as the principal bu&s;ine&s;s, and by a &s;trange ab&s;urdity, regard the character of the &s;overeign as but an appendix to that of the merchant, as &s;omething which ought to be made &s;ub&s;ervient to it, or by means of which they may be enabled to buy cheaper in India and thereby to
<PB N="252" REF="255">
&s;ell with a better profit in Europe. They endeavour for this purpo&s;e to keep out as much as po&s;&s;ible all competitors from the market of the countries which are &s;ubject to their government, and con&s;equently to reduce, at lea&s;t, &s;ome part of the &s;urplus produce of tho&s;e countries to what is barely &s;ufficient for &s;upplying their own demand, or to what they can expect to &s;ell in Europe with &s;uch a profit as they may think rea&s;onable. Their mercantile habits draw them in this manner, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, though perhaps in&s;en&s;ibly, to prefer upon all ordinary occa&s;ions the little and tran&s;itory profit of the monopoli&s;t to the great and permanent revenue of the &s;overeign, and would gradually lead them to treat the countries &s;ubject to their government nearly as the Dutch treat the Moluccas.</P>
<P>BUT if the genius of &s;uch a government, even as to what concerns its direction in Europe, is in this manner e&s;&s;entially and perhaps incurably faulty, that of its admini&s;tration in India is &s;till more &s;o. That admini&s;tration is nece&s;&s;arily compo&s;ed of a council of mer|chants, a profe&s;&s;ion no doubt extremely re&s;pectable, but which in no country in the world carries along with it that &s;ort of authority which naturally over-awes the people, and without force commands their willing obedience. Such a council can command obedience only by the military force with which they are accompanied, and their government is therefore nece&s;&s;arily military and de&s;potical. Their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, however, is that of merchants. It is to &s;ell, upon their ma&s;ters account, the European goods con&s;igned to them, and to buy in return Indian goods for the European market. It is to &s;ell the one as dear and to buy the other as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;equently to exclude as much as po&s;&s;ible all rivals from the particular market where they keep their &s;hop. The genius of the admini&s;tration; therefore, &s;o far as concerns the trade of the company, is the &s;ame as that of the direction. It tends to make government &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;t of monopoly, and
<PB N="253" REF="256">
con&s;equently to &s;tunt the natural growth of &s;ome parts at lea&s;t of the &s;urplus produce of the country to what is barely &s;ufficient for an&s;wering the demand of the company.</P>
<P>ALL the members of the admini&s;tration, be&s;ides, trade more or le&s;s upon their own account, and it is in vain to prohibit them from doing &s;o. Nothing can be more completely fooli&s;h than to expect that the clerks of a great counting-hou&s;e at ten thou&s;and miles di&s;tance, and con&s;equently almo&s;t quite out of &s;ight, &s;hould, upon a &s;imple order from their ma&s;ters, give up at once doing any &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s upon their own account, abandon forever all hopes of making a fortune of which they have the means in their hands, and content them&s;elves with the moderate &s;alaries which tho&s;e ma&s;ters allow them, and which, moderate as they are, can &s;eldom be aug|mented, being commonly as large as the real profits of the company trade can afford. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, to prohibit the &s;ervants of the company from trading upon their own account, can have &s;carce any other effect than to enable the &s;uperior &s;ervants, under pretence of executing their ma&s;ters order, to oppre&s;s &s;uch of the inferior ones as have had the misfortune to fall under their di&s;plea|&s;ure. The &s;ervants naturally endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame mono|poly in favour of their own private trade as of the publick trade of the company. If they are &s;uffered to act as they could wi&s;h, they will e&s;tabli&s;h this monopoly openly and directly, by fairly prohibiting all other people from trading in the articles in which they chu&s;e to deal; and this perhaps is the be&s;t and lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive way of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing it. But if by an order from Europe they are prohibited from doing this, they will, notwith&s;tanding, endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h a monopoly of the &s;ame kind, &s;ecretly and indirectly, in a way that is much more de&s;tructive to the country. They will employ the whole authority of government, and pervert the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in order to harra&s;s and ruin tho&s;e who interfere with them
<PB N="254" REF="257">
in any branch of commerce which by means of agents, either con|cealed or at lea&s;t not publickly avowed, they may chu&s;e to carry on. But the private trade of the &s;ervants will naturally extend to a much greater variety of articles than the publick trade of the company. The publick trade of the company extends no further than the trade with Europe, and comprehends a part only of the foreign trade of the country. But the private trade of the &s;ervants may extend to all the different branches both of its inland and foreign trade. The monopoly of the company can tend only to &s;tunt the natural growth of that part of the &s;urplus produce which in the ca&s;e of a free trade would be exported to Europe. That of the &s;ervants tends to &s;tunt the natural growth of every part of the produce in which they chu&s;e to deal, of what is de&s;tined for home con&s;umption, as well as of what is de&s;tined for exportation; and con&s;equently to degrade the cultivation of the whole country, and to reduce the number of its inhabitants. It tends to reduce the quan|tity of every &s;ort of produce, even that of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, whenever the &s;ervants of the company chu&s;e to deal in them, to what tho&s;e &s;ervants can both afford to buy and expect to &s;ell with &s;uch a profit as plea&s;es them.</P>
<P>FROM the nature of their &s;ituation too the &s;ervants mu&s;t be more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport with rigorous &s;everity their own intere&s;t again&s;t that of the country which they govern, than their ma&s;ters can be to &s;upport theirs. The country belongs to their ma&s;ters, who cannot avoid having &s;ome regard for the intere&s;t of what belongs to them. But it does not belong to the &s;ervants. The real intere&s;t of their ma&s;ters, if they were capable of under&s;tanding it, is the &s;ame with that of the country, and it is from ignorance only and the meanne&s;s of mercantile prejudice that they ever oppre&s;s it. But the real intere&s;t of the &s;ervants is by no means the &s;ame with that of the country, and the mo&s;t perfect information would not nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="255" REF="258">
put an end to their oppre&s;&s;ions. The regulations accordingly which have been &s;ent out from Europe, though they have been frequently weak, have commonly been well-meaning. More intelligence and perhaps le&s;s good-meaning has &s;ometimes appeared in tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ervants in India. It is a very &s;ingular government in which every member of the admini&s;tration wi&s;hes to get out of the country, and con&s;equently to have done with the government, as &s;oon as he can, and to who&s;e intere&s;t, the day after he has left it and carried his whole fortune with him, it is perfectly indifferent if the whole country was &s;wallowed up by an earthquake.</P>
<P>I MEAN not, however, by any thing which I have here &s;aid, to throw any odious imputation upon the general character of the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India company, and much le&s;s upon that of any particular per&s;ons. It is the &s;y&s;tem of government, the &s;ituation in which they were placed, that I mean to cen&s;ure; not the character of tho&s;e who have acted in it. They acted as their &s;ituation naturally directed, and they who have clamoured the loude&s;t again&s;t them would probably not have acted better them&s;elves. In war and negociation, the councils of Madra&s;s and Calcutta have upon &s;everal occa&s;ions conducted them&s;elves with a re&s;olution and deci&s;ive wi&s;dom which would have done honour to the &s;enate of Rome in the be&s;t days of that republick. The members of tho&s;e councils, however, had been bred to profe&s;&s;ions very different from war and politicks. But their &s;ituation alone, without education, experience, or even example, &s;eems to have formed in them all at once the great quali|ties which it required, and to have in&s;pired them both with abilities and virtues which they them&s;elves could not well know that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, therefore, it has animated them to actions of magnanimity which could not well have been expected from them; we &s;hould not wonder if upon others it has prompted them to exploits of &s;omewhat a different nature.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="259">
SUCH exclu&s;ive companies, therefore, are nui&s;ances in every re&s;pect; always more or le&s;s inconvenient to the countries in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and de&s;tructive to tho&s;e which have the misfor|tune to fall under their government.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the agricultural Sy&s;tems, or of tho&s;e Sy&s;tems of political Oeconomy which repre&s;ent the Produce of Land as either the &s;ole or the principal Source of the Revenue and Wealth of every Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE agricultural &s;y&s;tems of political oeconomy will not require &s;o long an explanation as that which I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow upon the mercantile or commercial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THAT &s;y&s;tem which repre&s;ents the produce of land as the &s;ole &s;ource of the revenue and wealth of every country, has, &s;o far as I know, never been adopted by any nation, and it at pre&s;ent exi&s;ts only in the &s;peculations of a few men of great learning and inge|nuity in France. It would not, &s;urely, be worth while to examine at great length the errors of a &s;y&s;tem which never has done, and probably never will do any harm in any part of the world. I &s;hall endeavour to explain, however, as di&s;tinctly as I can, the great outlines of this very ingenious &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>MR. Colbert, the famous mini&s;ter of Lewis XIVth, was a man of probity, of great indu&s;try and knowledge of detail; of great experience and acutene&s;s in the examination of publick accounts, and of abilities, in &s;hort, every way fitted for introducing method
<PB N="257" REF="260">
and good order into the collection and expenditure of the publick revenue. That mini&s;ter had unfortunately embraced all the preju|dices of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem. That &s;y&s;tem, in its nature and e&s;&s;ence a &s;y&s;tem of re&s;traint and regulation, could &s;carce fail to be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of bu&s;ine&s;s, who had been accu&s;tomed to regulate the different departments of publick offices, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary checks and controuls for confining each to its proper &s;phere. The indu&s;try and commerce of a great country he endeavoured to regulate upon the &s;ame model as the departments of a publick office; and in&s;tead of allowing every man to pur&s;ue his own intere&s;t his own way, upon the liberal plan of equality, liberty and ju&s;tice, he be&s;towed upon certain branches of indu&s;try extraordinary privileges, while he laid others under as extraordinary re&s;traints. He was not only di&s;po&s;ed, like other European mini&s;ters, to encourage more the indu&s;try of the towns than that of the country, but in order to &s;upport the indu&s;try of the towns, he was willing even to depre&s;s and keep down that of the country. In order to render provi&s;ions cheap to the inhabitants of the towns, and thereby to encourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he prohibited altogether the exportation of corn, and thus excluded the inhabitants of the country from every foreign market for by far the mo&s;t important part of the produce of their indu&s;try. This prohibition, joined to the re&s;traints impo&s;ed by the antient provincial laws of France upon the tran&s;portation of corn from one province to another, and to the arbitrary and degrading taxes which are levied upon the cultivators in almo&s;t all the provinces, di&s;couraged and kept down the agriculture of that country very much below the &s;tate to which it would naturally have ri&s;en in &s;o very fertile a &s;oil and &s;o very happy a climate. This &s;tate of di&s;couragement and depre&s;&s;ion was felt more or le&s;s in every different part of the country, and many different enquiries were &s;et on foot concerning the cau&s;es of it. One of tho&s;e cau&s;es
<PB N="258" REF="261">
appeared to be the preference given, by the in&s;titutions of Mr. Colbert, to the indu&s;try of the towns above that of the country.</P>
<P>IF the rod be bent too much one way, &s;ays the proverb, in order to make it &s;traight you mu&s;t bend it as much the other. The French philo&s;ophers, who have propo&s;ed the &s;y&s;tem which repre&s;ents agriculture as the &s;ole &s;ource of the revenue and wealth of every country, &s;eem to have adopted this proverbial maxim; and as in the plan of Mr. Colbert the indu&s;try of the towns was certainly over-valued in compari&s;on with that of the country; &s;o in their &s;y&s;tem it &s;eems to be as certainly under-valued.</P>
<P>THE different orders of people who have ever been &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute in any re&s;pect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, they divide into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is the cla&s;s of the proprietors of land. The &s;econd is the cla&s;s of the cultivators, of farmers and country labourers, whom they honour with the peculiar appellation of the productive cla&s;s. The third is the cla&s;s of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, whom they endeavour to degrade by the humiliating appellation of the barren or unproductive cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE cla&s;s of proprietors contributes to the annual produce by the expence which they may occa&s;ionally lay out upon the improve|ment of the land, upon the buildings, drains, enclo&s;ures and other ameliorations, which they may either make or maintain upon it, and by means of which the cultivators are enabled, with the &s;ame capital, to rai&s;e a greater produce, and con&s;equently to pay a greater rent. This advanced rent may be con&s;idered as the intere&s;t or profit due to the proprietor upon the expence or capital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land. Such expences are in this &s;y&s;tem called ground expences (depen&s;es foncieres).</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">
THE cultivators or farmers contribute to the annual produce by what are in this &s;y&s;tem called the original and annual expences (depen&s;es primitives et depen&s;es annuelles) which they lay out upon the cultivation of the land. The original expences con&s;i&s;t in the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, in the &s;tock of cattle, in the &s;eed, and in the maintenance of the farmer's family, &s;ervants and cattle, during at lea&s;t a great part of the fir&s;t year of his occu|pancy, or till he can receive &s;ome return from the land. The annual expences con&s;i&s;t in the &s;eed, in the tear and wear of the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, and in the annual maintenance of the farmer's &s;ervants and cattle, and of his family too, &s;o far as any part of them can be con&s;idered as &s;ervants employed in cultiva|tion. That part of the produce of the land which remains to him after paying the rent, ought to be &s;ufficient, fir&s;t, to replace to him within a rea&s;onable time, at lea&s;t during the term of his occupancy, the whole of his original expences, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock; and, &s;econdly, to replace to him an|nually the whole of his annual expences, together likewi&s;e with the ordinary profits of &s;tock. Tho&s;e two &s;orts of expences are two capitals which the farmer employs in cultivation; and unle&s;s they are regularly re&s;tored to him, together with a rea&s;onable profit, he cannot carry on his employment upon a level with other employments; but, from a regard to his own intere&s;t, mu&s;t de&s;ert it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;eek &s;ome other employ|ment. That part of the produce of the land which is thus ne|ce&s;&s;ary for enabling the farmer to continue his bu&s;ine&s;s, ought to be con&s;idered as a fund &s;acred to cultivation, which if the land|lord violates, he nece&s;&s;arily degrades the produce of his own land, and in a few years not only di&s;ables the farmer from paying this racked rent, but from paying the rea&s;onable rent which he might otherwi&s;e have got for his land. The rent which properly belongs to the landlord, is no more than the neat produce which remains
<PB N="260" REF="263">
after paying in the compleate&s;t manner all the nece&s;&s;ary expences which mu&s;t be previou&s;ly laid out in order to rai&s;e the gro&s;s, or the whole produce. It is becau&s;e the labour of the cultivators, over and above paying compleatly all tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary expences, affords a neat produce of this kind, that this cla&s;s of people are in this &s;y&s;tem peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the honourable appellation of the productive cla&s;s. Their original and annual expences are for the &s;ame rea&s;on called, in this &s;y&s;tem, productive expences, becau&s;e, over and above replacing their own value, they occa&s;ion the annual reproduction of this neat produce.</P>
<P>THE ground expences, as they are called, or what the land|lord lays out upon the improvement of his land, are in this &s;y&s;tem too honoured with the appellation of productive expences. Till the whole of tho&s;e expences, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock, have been compleatly repaid to him by the ad|vanced rent which he gets from his land, that advanced rent ought to be regarded as &s;acred and inviolable, both by the church and by the king; ought to be &s;ubject neither to tithe nor to taxa|tion. If it is otherwi&s;e, by di&s;couraging the improvement of land, the church di&s;courages the future increa&s;e of her own tithes, and the king the future increa&s;e of his own taxes. As in a well ordered &s;tate of things, therefore, tho&s;e ground expences, over and above reproducing in the compleate&s;t manner their own value, occa&s;ion likewi&s;e after a certain time a reproduction of a neat produce, they are in this &s;y&s;tem con&s;idered as productive expences.</P>
<P>THE ground expences of the landlord, however, together with the original and the annual expences of the farmer, are the only three &s;orts of expences which in this &s;y&s;tem are con&s;idered as pro|ductive. All other expences and all other orders of people, even tho&s;e who in the common apprehen&s;ions of men are regarded as
<PB N="261" REF="264">
the mo&s;t productive, are in this account of things repre&s;ented as altogether barren and unproductive.</P>
<P>ARTIFICERS and manufacturers, in particular, who&s;e indu&s;try, in the common apprehen&s;ions of men, increa&s;es &s;o much the value of the rude produce of land, are in this &s;y&s;tem repre&s;ented as a cla&s;s of people altogether barren and unproductive. Their labour, it is &s;aid, replaces only the &s;tock which employs them, together with its ordinary profits. That &s;tock con&s;i&s;ts in the ma|terials, tools, and wages, advanced to them by their employer; and is the fund de&s;tined for their employment and maintenance. Its profits are the fund de&s;tined for the maintenance of their em|ployer. Their employer, as he advances to them the &s;tock of materials, tools and wages nece&s;&s;ary for their employment, &s;o he advances to him&s;elf what is nece&s;&s;ary for his own maintenance, and this maintenance he generally proportions to the profit which he expects to make by the price of their work. Unle&s;s its price repays to him the maintenance which he advances to him&s;elf, as well as the materials, tools and wages which he advances to his workmen, it evidently does not repay him the whole expence which he lays out upon it. The profits of manufacturing &s;tock, therefore, are not, like the rent of land, a neat produce which remains after compleatly repaying the whole expence which mu&s;t be laid out in order to obtain them. The &s;tock of the farmer yields him a profit as well as that of the ma&s;ter manufacturer; and it yields a rent likewi&s;e to another per&s;on, which that of the ma&s;ter manufacturer does not. The expence, therefore, laid out in employing and maintaining artificers and manufacturers, does no more than continue, if one may &s;ay &s;o, the exi&s;tence of its own value, and does not produce any new value. It is therefore altogether a barren and unproductive expence. The expence, on the contrary, laid out in employing farmers and country
<PB N="262" REF="265">
labourers, over and above continuing the exi&s;tence of its own value, produces a new value, the rent of the landlord. It is there|fore a productive expence.</P>
<P>MERCANTILE &s;tock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing &s;tock. It only continues the exi&s;tence of its own value, without producing any new value. Its profits are only the repayment of the maintenance which its employer advances to him&s;elf during the time that he employs it, or till he receives the returns of it. They are only the repayment of a part of the expence which mu&s;t be laid out in employing it.</P>
<P>THE labour of artificers and manufacturers never adds any thing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land. It adds indeed greatly to the value of &s;ome particular parts of it. But the con&s;umption which in the mean time it occa&s;ions of other parts, is preci&s;ely equal to the value which it adds to tho&s;e parts; &s;o that the value of the whole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the lea&s;t augmented by it. The per&s;on who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles, for example, will &s;ometimes rai&s;e the value of perhaps a pennyworth of flax to thirty pounds &s;terling. But though at fir&s;t &s;ight he appears thereby to multiply the value of a part of the rude produce about &s;even thou&s;and and two hundred times, he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce. The working of that lace co&s;ts him perhaps two years labour. The thirty pounds which he gets for it when it is fini&s;hed, is no more than the repay|ment of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which he advances to him&s;elf during the two years that he is employed about it. The value which, by every day's, month's, or year's labour, he adds to the flax, does no more than replace the value of his own con&s;umption during that day, month, or year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add
<PB N="263" REF="266">
any thing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land: the portion of that produce which he is continually con&s;uming, being always equal to the value which he is continually producing. The extream poverty of the greater part of the per&s;ons employed in this expen&s;ive, though trifling manufacture, may &s;atisfy us that the price of their work does not in ordinary ca&s;es exceed the value of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. It is otherwi&s;e with the work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of the landlord is a value, which, in ordinary ca&s;es, it is con|tinually producing, over and above replacing, in the mo&s;t compleat manner, the whole con&s;umption, the whole expence laid out upon the employment and maintenance both of the workmen and of their employer.</P>
<P>ARTIFICERS, manufacturers and merchants, can augment the revenue and wealth of their &s;ociety, by par&s;imony only; or, as it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in this &s;y&s;tem, by privation, that is, by depriving them&s;elves of a part of the funds de&s;tined for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They annually reproduce nothing but tho&s;e funds. Unle&s;s, therefore, they annually &s;ave &s;ome part of them, unle&s;s they annually deprive them&s;elves of the enjoyment of &s;ome part of them, the revenue and wealth of their &s;ociety can never be in the &s;malle&s;t degree augmented by means of their indu&s;try. Farmers and country labourers, on the contrary, may enjoy compleatly the whole funds de&s;tined for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and yet augment at the &s;ame time the revenue and wealth of their &s;ociety. Over and above the funds de&s;tined for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, their indu&s;try annually affords a neat produce, of which the augmentation nece&s;&s;arily augments the revenue and wealth of their &s;ociety. Nations, therefore, which, like France or England, con&s;i&s;t in a great mea&s;ure of proprietors and cultivators, can be enriched by indu&s;try and enjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which, like Holland and Hamburgh, are compo&s;ed chiefly of merchants, artificers and manufacturers, can grow rich
<PB N="264" REF="267">
only through par&s;imony and privation. As the intere&s;t of nations &s;o differently circum&s;tanced is very different, &s;o is likewi&s;e the com|mon character of the people. In tho&s;e of the former kind libera|lity, frankne&s;s, and good fellow&s;hip, naturally make a part of that common character. In the latter, narrowne&s;s, meanne&s;s, and a &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, aver&s;e to all &s;ocial plea&s;ure and enjoyment.</P>
<P>THE unproductive cla&s;s, that of merchants, artificers, and manu|facturers, is maintained and employed altogether at the expence of the two other cla&s;&s;es, of that of proprietors, and of that of culti|vators. They furni&s;h it both with the materials of its work and with the fund of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, with the corn and cattle which it con&s;umes while it is employed about that work. The proprietors and cultivators finally pay both the wages of all the workmen of the unproductive cla&s;s, and the profits of all their employers. Tho&s;e workmen and their employers are properly the &s;ervants of the proprietors and cultivators. They are only &s;ervants who work without doors, as menial &s;ervants work within. Both the one and the other, however, are equally maintained at the expence of the &s;ame ma&s;ters. The labour of both is equally unproductive. It adds nothing to the value of the &s;um total of the rude produce of the land. In&s;tead of increa&s;ing the value of that &s;um total, it is a charge and expence which mu&s;t be paid out of it.</P>
<P>THE unproductive cla&s;s, however, is not only u&s;eful, but greatly u&s;eful to the other two cla&s;&s;es. By means of the indu&s;try of mer|chants, artificers, and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultiva|tors can purcha&s;e both the foreign goods and the manufactured produce of their own country which they have occa&s;ion for, with the produce of a much &s;maller quantity of their own labour than what they would be obliged to employ if they were to attempt, in an aukward and un&s;kilful manner, either to import the one or to
<PB N="265" REF="268">
make the other for their own u&s;e. By means of the unproductive cla&s;s, the cultivators are delivered from many cares which would otherwi&s;e di&s;tract their attention from the cultivation of land. The &s;uperiority of produce which, in con&s;equence of this undivided attention, they are enabled to rai&s;e, is fully &s;ufficient to pay the whole expence which the maintenance and employment of the unproductive cla&s;s co&s;ts either the proprietors, or them&s;elves. The indu&s;try of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, though in its own nature altogether unproductive, yet contributes in this manner indirectly to increa&s;e the produce of the land. It increa&s;es the productive powers of productive labour, by leaving it at liberty to confine it&s;elf to its proper employment, the cultiva|tion of land; and the plough goes frequently the ea&s;ier and the better by means of the labour of the man who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is mo&s;t remote from the plough.</P>
<P>IT can never be the intere&s;t of the proprietors and cultivators to re&s;train or to di&s;courage in any re&s;pect the indu&s;try of mer|chants, artificers and manufacturers. The greater the liberty which this unproductive cla&s;s enjoys, the greater will be the com|petition in all the different trades which compo&s;e it, and the cheaper will the other two cla&s;&s;es be &s;upplied both with foreign goods, and with the manufactured produce of their own country.</P>
<P>IT can never be the intere&s;t of the unproductive cla&s;s to oppre&s;s the other two cla&s;&s;es. It is the &s;urplus produce of the land, or what remains after deducting the maintenance, fir&s;t, of the cultiva|tors, and afterwards of the proprietors, that maintains and employs the unproductive cla&s;s. The greater this &s;urplus the greater mu&s;t likewi&s;e be its maintenance and employment. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of perfect ju&s;tice, of perfect liberty, and of perfect equality, is the
<PB N="266" REF="269">
very &s;imple &s;ecret which mo&s;t effectually &s;ecures the highe&s;t degred of pro&s;perity to all the three cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE merchants, artificers, and manufacturers of tho&s;e mercantile &s;tates which, like Holland and Hamburgh, con&s;i&s;t chiefly of this unproductive cla&s;s, are in the &s;ame manner maintained and em|ployed altogether at the expence of the proprietors and cultivators of land. The only difference is, that tho&s;e proprietors and culti|vators are, the greater part of them, placed at a mo&s;t inconvenient di&s;tance from the merchants, artificers, and manufacturers whom they &s;upply with the materials of their work and the fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, are the inhabitants of other countries, and the &s;ubjects of other governments.</P>
<P>SUCH mercantile &s;tates, however, are not only u&s;eful, but greatly u&s;eful to the inhabitants of tho&s;e other countries. They fill up, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a very important void, and &s;upply the place of the merchants, artificers and manufacturers, whom the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries ought to find at home, but whom, from &s;ome defect in their policy, they do not find at home.</P>
<P>IT can never be the intere&s;t of tho&s;e landed nations, if I may call them &s;o, to di&s;courage or di&s;tre&s;s the indu&s;try of &s;uch mercantile &s;tates, by impo&s;ing high duties upon their trade, or upon the commodities which they furni&s;h. Such duties, by rendering tho&s;e commodities dearer, could &s;erve only to &s;ink the real value of the &s;urplus produce of their own land, with which, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, with the price of which tho&s;e commodities are purcha&s;ed. Such duties could &s;erve only to di&s;courage the increa&s;e of that &s;urplus produce, and con&s;equently the improvement and cultivation of their own land. The mo&s;t effectual expedient, on the contrary, for rai&s;ing the value of that &s;urplus produce, for
<PB N="267" REF="270">
encouraging its increa&s;e, and con&s;equently the improvement and cultivation of their own land, would be to allow the mo&s;t perfect freedom to the trade of all &s;uch mercantile nations.</P>
<P>THIS perfect freedom of trade would even be the mo&s;t effectual expedient for &s;upplying them, in due time, with all the artificers, manufacturers and merchants, whom they wanted at home, and for filling up in the propere&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous manner that very important void which they felt there.</P>
<P>THE continual increa&s;e of the &s;urplus produce of their land, would, in due time, create a greater capital than what could be employed with the ordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land; and the &s;urplus part of it would naturally turn it&s;elf to the employment of artificers and manufacturers at home. But tho&s;e artificers and manufacturers, finding at home, both the materials of their work and the fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, might immediately, even with much le&s;s art and &s;kill, be able to work as cheap as the like artificers and manufacturers of &s;uch mercantile &s;tates, who had both to bring from a great di&s;tance. Even though, from want of art and &s;kill, they might not for &s;ome time be able to work as cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they might be able to &s;ell their work there as cheap as that of the artificers and manufacturers of &s;uch mercantile &s;tates, which could not be brought to that market but from &s;o great a di&s;tance; and as their art and &s;kill improved, they would &s;oon be able to &s;ell it cheaper. The artificers and manufacturers of &s;uch mercantile &s;tates, therefore, would immediately be rivalled in the market of tho&s;e landed nations, and &s;oon after under&s;old and ju&s;tled out of it altogether. The cheapne&s;s of the manufacturers of tho&s;e landed nations, in con&s;e|quence of the gradual improvements of art and &s;kill, would, in due time, extend their &s;ale beyond the home market, and carry
<PB N="268" REF="271">
them to many foreign markets, from which they would in the &s;ame manner gradually ju&s;tle out many of the manufactures of &s;uch mercantile nations.</P>
<P>THIS continual increa&s;e both of the rude and manufactured produce of tho&s;e landed nations would in due time create a greater capital than could, with the ordinary rate of profit, be employed either in agriculture or in manufacturers. The &s;urplus of this capital would naturally turn it&s;elf to foreign trade, and be employed in exporting to foreign countries &s;uch parts of the rude and manufactured produce of its own country as exceeded the demand of the home market. In the exportation of the produce of their own country, the merchants of a landed nation would have an advantage of the &s;ame kind over tho&s;e of mercantile nations, which its artificers and manufacturers had over the artificers and manufacturers of &s;uch nations; the advantage of finding at home that cargo, and tho&s;e &s;tores and provi|&s;ions, which the others were obliged to &s;eek for at a di&s;tance. With inferior art and &s;kill in navigation, therefore, they would be able to &s;ell that cargo as cheap in foreign markets as the merchants of &s;uch mercantile nations; and with equal art and &s;kill they would be able to &s;ell it cheaper. They would &s;oon, therefore, rival tho&s;e mercantile nations in this branch of their foreign trade, and in due time would ju&s;tle them out of it altogether.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this liberal and generous &s;y&s;tem, therefore, the mo&s;t advantageous method in which a landed nation can rai&s;e up arti|ficers, manufacturers and merchants of its own, is to grant the mo&s;t perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers and mer|chants of all other nations. It thereby rai&s;es the value of the &s;urplus produce of its own land, of which the continual increa&s;e gradually e&s;tabli&s;hes a fund which in due time nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;es up all the
<PB N="269" REF="272">
artificers, manufacturers and merchants whom it has occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>WHEN a landed nation, on the contrary, oppre&s;&s;es either by high duties or by prohibitions the trade of foreign nations, it nece&s;|&s;arily hurts its own intere&s;t in two different ways. Fir&s;t, by rai&s;ing the price of all foreign goods and of all &s;orts of manufactures, it nece&s;&s;arily &s;inks the real value of the &s;urplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, with the price of which it purcha&s;es tho&s;e foreign goods and manufactures. Secondly, by giving a &s;ort of monopoly of the home market to its own merchants, artificers and manufacturers, it rai&s;es the rate of mercantile and manufacturing profit in proportion to that of agricultural profit, and con&s;equently either draws from agriculture a part of the capital which had before been employed in it, or hinders from going to it a part of what would otherwi&s;e have gone to it. This policy, therefore, di&s;courages agriculture in two different ways; fir&s;t, by &s;inking the real value of its produce, and thereby lowering the rate of its profit; and, &s;econdly, by rai&s;ing the rate of profit in all other employments. Agriculture is rendered le&s;s advantageous, and trade and manufactures more advantageous than they other|wi&s;e would be; and every man is tempted by his own intere&s;t to turn, as much as he can, both his capital and his indu&s;try from the former to the latter employments.</P>
<P>THOUGH, by this oppre&s;&s;ive policy, a landed nation &s;hould be able to rai&s;e up artificers, manufacturers and merchants, of its own, &s;omewhat &s;ooner than it could do by the freedom of trade; a matter, however, which is not a little doubtful; yet it would rai&s;e them up, if one may &s;ay &s;o, prematurely, and before it was perfectly ripe for them. By rai&s;ing up too ha&s;tily one &s;pecies of indu&s;try, it would depre&s;s another more valuable &s;pecies of indu&s;try. By rai&s;ing
<PB N="270" REF="273">
up too ha&s;tily a &s;pecies of indu&s;try which only replaces the &s;tock which employs it, together with the ordinary profit, it would depre&s;s a &s;pecies of indu&s;try which, over and above replacing that &s;tock with its profit, affords likewi&s;e a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. It would depre&s;s productive labour, by encou|raging too ha&s;tily that labour which is altogether barren and unproductive.</P>
<P>IN what manner, according to this &s;y&s;tem, the &s;um total of the annual produce of the land is di&s;tributed among the three cla&s;&s;es abovementioned, and in what manner the labour of the unpro|ductive cla&s;s, does no more than replace the value of its own con&s;umption, without increa&s;ing in any re&s;pect the value of that &s;um total, is repre&s;ented by Mr. Que&s;nai, the very ingenious and profound author of this &s;y&s;tem, in &s;ome arithmetical formularies. The fir&s;t of the&s;e formularies, which by way of eminence he peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of the Oeconomical Table, repre&s;ents the manner in which he &s;uppo&s;es this di&s;tribution takes place, in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t perfect liberty, and therefore of the highe&s;t pro&s;perity; in a &s;tate where the annual produce is &s;uch as to afford the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible neat produce, and where each cla&s;s enjoys its proper &s;hare of the whole annual produce. Some &s;ub&s;equent formularies repre&s;ent the manner in which, he &s;uppo&s;es, this di&s;tri|bution is made in different &s;tates of re&s;traint and regulation; in which, either the cla&s;s of proprietors, or the barren and unproductive cla&s;s, is more favoured than the cla&s;s of cultivators, and in which either the one or the other encroaches more or le&s;s upon the &s;hare which ought properly to belong to this productive cla&s;s. Every &s;uch encroachment, every violation of that natural di&s;tribution, which the mo&s;t perfect liberty would e&s;tabli&s;h, mu&s;t, according to this &s;y&s;tem, nece&s;&s;arily degrade more or le&s;s from one year to another the value and &s;um total of the annual produce, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion
<PB N="271" REF="274">
a gradual declen&s;ion in the real wealth and revenue of the &s;ociety; a declen&s;ion of which the progre&s;s mu&s;t be quicker or &s;lower, according to the degree of this encroachment, according as that natural di&s;tribution, which the mo&s;t perfect liberty would e&s;tabli&s;h, is more or le&s;s violated. Tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent formularies repre&s;ent the different degrees of declen&s;ion, which, according to this &s;y&s;tem, corre&s;pond to the different degrees in which this natural di&s;tribution of things is violated.</P>
<P>SOME &s;peculative phy&s;icians &s;eem to have imagined that the health of the human body could be pre&s;erved only by a certain preci&s;e regimen of diet and exerci&s;e, of which every the &s;malle&s;t violation nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned &s;ome degree of di&s;ea&s;e or di&s;order proportioned to the degree of the violation. Experience, however, would &s;eem to &s;how that the human body frequently pre&s;erves, at lea&s;t to all appearance, the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of health under a va&s;t variety of different regimens; even under &s;ome which are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly whole&s;ome. But the healthful &s;tate of the human body, it would &s;eem, contains in it&s;elf &s;ome unknown principle of pre&s;ervation, capable either of preventing or of correcting, in many re&s;pects, the bad effects even of a very faulty regimen. Mr. Que&s;nai, who was him&s;elf a phy&s;i|cian, and a very &s;peculative phy&s;ician, &s;eems to have entertained a notion of the &s;ame kind concerning the political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive and pro&s;per only under a certain preci&s;e regimen, the exact regimen of perfect liberty and perfect ju&s;tice. He &s;eems not to have con&s;idered that in the political body, the natural effort which every man is continually making to better his own condition, is a principle of pre&s;ervation capable of prevent|ing and correcting in many re&s;pects the bad effects of a political oeconomy in &s;ome degree both partial and oppre&s;&s;ive. Such a political oeconomy, though it no doubt retards more or le&s;s,
<PB N="272" REF="275">
is not always capable of &s;topping altogether the natural progre&s;s of a nation towards wealth and pro&s;perity, and &s;till le&s;s of making it go backwards. If a nation could not pro&s;per without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect ju&s;tice, there is not in the world a nation which could ever have pro&s;pered. In the political body, however, the wi&s;dom of nature has fortunately made ample provi&s;ion for remedying many of the bad effects of the folly and inju&s;tice of man; in the &s;ame manner as it has done in the natural body for remedying tho&s;e of his &s;loth and intem|perance.</P>
<P>THE capital error of this &s;y&s;tem, however, &s;eems to lie in its repre&s;enting the cla&s;s of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, as altogether barren and unproductive. The following ob&s;ervations may &s;erve to &s;how the impropriety of this repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>FIRST, this cla&s;s, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of its own annual con&s;umption, and continues, at lea&s;t, the exi&s;tence of the &s;tock or capital which maintains and employs it. But upon this account alone the denomination of barren or unpro|ductive &s;hould &s;eem to be very improperly applied to it. We &s;hould not call a marriage barren or unproductive, though it produced only a &s;on and a daughter, to replace the father and mother, and though it did not increa&s;e the number of the human &s;pecies, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country labourers, indeed, over and above the &s;tock which maintains and employs them, reproduce annually a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a marriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than one which affords only two; &s;o the labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly more productive than that of merchants, artificers and manufacturers. The &s;upe|rior
<PB N="273" REF="276">
produce of the one cla&s;s, however, does not render the other barren or unproductive.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it &s;eems, upon this account, altogether improper to con&s;ider artificers, manufacturers and merchants, in the &s;ame light as menial &s;ervants. The labour of menial &s;ervants does not conti|nue the exi&s;tence of the fund which maintains and employs them. Their maintenance and employment is altogether at the expence of their ma&s;ters, and the work which they perform is not of a nature to repay that expence. That work con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ervices which peri&s;h generally in the very in&s;tant of their performance, and does not fix or realize it&s;elf in any vendible commodity which can replace the value of their wages and maintenance. The labour, on the contrary, of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, naturally does fix and realize it&s;elf in &s;ome &s;uch vendible commodity. It is upon this account that, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and unproductive labour, I have cla&s;&s;ed artificers, manufacturers and merchants, among the productive labourers, and menial &s;ervants among the barren or unproductive.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, it &s;eems, upon every &s;uppo&s;ition, improper to &s;ay, that the labour of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, does not increa&s;e the real revenue of the &s;ociety. Though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, for example, as it &s;eems to be &s;uppo&s;ed in this &s;y&s;tem, that the value of the daily, monthly, and yearly con&s;umption of this cla&s;s was exactly equal to that of its daily, monthly, and yearly production, yet it would not from thence follow that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety. An artificer, for example, who in the fir&s;t &s;ix months after harve&s;t, executes ten pounds worth of work, though he &s;hould in the &s;ame time con&s;ume ten pounds worth of corn and other nece&s;&s;aries, yet really adds the value of ten pounds to the
<PB N="274" REF="277">
annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety. While he has been con&s;uming a half yearly revenue of ten pounds worth of corn and other nece&s;&s;aries, he has produced an equal value of work capable of purcha&s;ing, either to him&s;elf or to &s;ome other per&s;on, an equal half yearly revenue. The value, therefore, of what has been con&s;umed and produced during the&s;e &s;ix months is equal, not to ten, but to twenty pounds. It is po&s;&s;ible, indeed, that no more than ten pounds worth of this value, may ever have exi&s;ted at any one moment of time. But if the ten pounds worth of corn and other nece&s;&s;aries, which were con&s;umed by the artificer, had been con&s;umed by a &s;oldier or by a menial &s;ervant, the value of that part of the annual produce which exi&s;ted at the end of the &s;ix months, would have been ten pounds le&s;s than it actually is in con&s;equence of the labour of the artificer. Though the value of what the artificer produces, therefore, &s;hould not at any one moment of time be &s;uppo&s;ed greater than the value he con&s;umes, yet at every moment of time the actually exi&s;ting value of goods in the market is, in con&s;e|quence of what he produces, greater than it otherwi&s;e would be.</P>
<P>WHEN the patrons of this &s;y&s;tem a&s;&s;ert that the con&s;umption of artificers, manufacturers and merchants, is equal to the value of what they produce, they probably mean no more than that their revenue, or the fund de&s;tined for their con&s;umption, is equal to it. But if they had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves more accurately, and only a&s;&s;erted that the revenue of this cla&s;s was equal to the value of what they produced, it might readily have occurred to the reader that what would naturally be &s;aved out of this revenue, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e more or le&s;s the real wealth of the &s;ociety. In order, therefore, to make out &s;omething like an argument, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould expre&s;s them&s;elves as they have done; and this argument, even &s;uppo&s;ing things actually were as it &s;eems to pre&s;ume them to be, turns out to be a very inconclu&s;ive one.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="278">
FOURTHLY, farmers and country labourers can no more aug|ment, without par&s;imony, the real revenue, the annual produce of the land and labour of their &s;ociety, than artificers, manufac|turers and merchants. The annual produce of the land and labour of any &s;ociety can be augmented only in two ways; either, fir&s;t, by &s;ome improvement in the productive powers of the u&s;eful labour actually maintained within it; or, &s;econdly, by &s;ome increa&s;e in the quantity of that labour.</P>
<P>THE improvement in the productive powers of u&s;eful labour depend, fir&s;t, upon the improvement in the ability of the work|man; and, &s;econdly, upon that of the machinery with which he works. But the labour of artificers and manufacturers, as it is capable of being more &s;ubdivided, and the labour of each workman reduced to a greater &s;implicity of operation than that of farmers and country labourers, &s;o it is likewi&s;e capable of both the&s;e &s;orts of improvement in a much higher degree. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Chap. I. N n 2</NOTE> In this re&s;pect, there|fore, the cla&s;s of cultivators can have no &s;ort of advantage over that of artificers and manufacturers.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e in the quantity of u&s;eful labour actually employed within any &s;ociety, mu&s;t depend altogether upon the increa&s;e of the capital which employs it; and the increa&s;e of that capital again mu&s;t be exactly equal to the amount of the &s;avings from the revenue either of the particular per&s;ons who manage and direct the employ|ment of that capital, or of &s;ome other per&s;ons who lend it to them. If merchants, artificers and manufacturers are, as this &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, naturally more inclined to par&s;imony and &s;aving than proprietors and cultivators, they are, &s;o far, more likely to aug|ment
<PB N="276" REF="279">
the quantity of u&s;eful labour employed within their &s;ociety, and con&s;equently to increa&s;e its real revenue, the annual produce of its land and labour.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY and la&s;tly, though the revenue of the inhabitants of every country was &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t altogether, as this &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, in the quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which their indu&s;try could procure to them; yet, even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, the revenue of a trading and manufacturing country mu&s;t, other things being equal, always be much greater than that of one without trade or manufactures. By means of trade and manufactures, a greater quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence can be annually imported into a particular country than what its own lands, in the actual &s;tate of their culti|vation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town, though they fre|quently po&s;&s;e&s;s no lands of their own, yet draw to them&s;elves by their indu&s;try &s;uch a quantity of the rude produce of the lands of other people as &s;upplies them, not only with the materials of their work, but with the fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. What a town always is with regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one inde|pendent &s;tate or country may frequently be with regard to other independent &s;tates or countries. It is thus that Holland draws a great part of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from other countries; live cattle from Hol&s;tein and Jutland, and corn from almo&s;t all the different coun|tries of Europe. A &s;mall quantity of manufactured produce pur|cha&s;es a great quantity of rude produce. A trading and manufactur|ing country, therefore, naturally purcha&s;es with a &s;mall part of its manufactured produce a great part of the rude produce of other coun|tries; while, on the contrary, a country without trade and manu|factures is generally obliged to purcha&s;e, at the expence of a great part of its rude produce, a very &s;mall part of the manufactured produce of other countries. The one exports what can &s;ub&s;i&s;t and accom|modate but a very few, and imports the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and accommo|dation of a great number. The other exports the accommodation
<PB N="277" REF="280">
and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a great number, and imports that of a very few only. The inhabitants of the one mu&s;t always enjoy a much greater quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than what their own lands, in the actual &s;tate of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of the other mu&s;t always enjoy a much &s;maller quantity.</P>
<P>THIS &s;y&s;tem, however, with all its imperfections is, perhaps the neare&s;t approximation to the truth that has yet been publi&s;hed upon the &s;ubject of political oeconomy, and is upon that account well worth the con&s;ideration of every man who wi&s;hes to examine with attention the principles of that very important &s;cience. Though in repre&s;enting the labour which is employed upon land as the only productive labour, the notions which it inculcates are perhaps too narrow and confined; yet in repre&s;enting the wealth of nations as con&s;i&s;ting, not in the uncon&s;umable riches of money, but in the con&s;umable goods annually reproduced by the labour of the &s;ociety; and in repre&s;enting perfect liberty as the only effectual expedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible, its doctrine &s;eems to be in every re&s;pect as ju&s;t as it is generous and liberal. Its followers are very numerous; and as men are fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to under&s;tand what &s;urpa&s;&s;es the comprehen&s;ion of ordinary people, the paradox which it maintains, concerning the unproductive nature of manufacturing labour, has not perhaps contributed a little to increa&s;e the number of its admirers. They have for &s;ome years pa&s;t made a pretty con&s;iderable &s;ect, di&s;tingui&s;hed in the French republick of letters by the name of, The Oeconomi&s;ts. Their works have certainly been of &s;ome &s;ervice to their country; not only by bringing into general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, many &s;ubjects which had never been well examined before, but by influencing in &s;ome mea&s;ure the publick admini&s;tration in favour of agriculture. It has been in con&s;equence of their repre&s;entations, accordingly, that the agriculture of France has been delivered from &s;everal of the
<PB N="278" REF="281">
oppre&s;&s;ions which it before laboured under. The term during which &s;uch a lea&s;e can be granted, as will be valid again&s;t every future purcha&s;er or proprietor of the land, has been prolonged from nine to twenty-&s;even years. The antient provincial re&s;traints upon the tran&s;portation of corn from one province of the kingdom to another, have been entirely taken away, and the liberty of exporting it to all foreign countries, has been e&s;tabli&s;hed as the common law of the kingdom in all ordinary ca&s;es. This &s;ect, in their works, which are very numerous, and which treat not only of what is properly called Political Oeconomy, or of the nature and cau&s;es of the wealth of nations, but of every other branch of the &s;y&s;tem of civil government, all follow implicitly, and without any &s;en&s;ible variation, the doctrine of Mr. Que&s;nai. There is upon this account little variety in the greater part of their works. The mo&s;t di&s;tinct and be&s;t connected account of this doctrine is to be found in a little book written by Mr. Mercier de la Riviere, &s;ome|time Intendant of Martinico, intitled, The natural and e&s;&s;ential Order of Political Societies. The admiration of this whole &s;ect for their ma&s;ter, who was him&s;elf a man of the greate&s;t mode&s;ty and &s;implicity, is not inferior to that of any of the antient philo&s;ophers for the founders of their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems. There have been, &s;ince the world began, &s;ays a very diligent and re&s;pectable author, the Marquis de Mirabeau, three great inventions which have princi|pally given &s;tability to political &s;ocieties, independent of many other inventions which have enriched and adorned them. The fir&s;t is the invention of writing, which alone gives human nature the power of tran&s;mitting without alteration, its laws, its contracts, its annals, and its di&s;coveries. The &s;econd, is the invention of money, which binds together all the relations between civilized &s;ocieties. The third, is the Oeconomical Table, the re&s;ult of the other two, which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great di&s;covery of our age, but of which our po&s;terity will reap the benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282">
AS the political oeconomy of the nations of modern Europe, has been more favourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the indu&s;try of the towns, than to agriculture, the indu&s;try of the country; &s;o that of other nations has followed a different plan, and has been more favourable to agriculture than to manufactures and foreign trade.</P>
<P>THE policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employments. In China, the condition of a labourer is &s;aid to be as much &s;uperior to that of an artificer; as in mo&s;t parts of Europe, that of an artificer is to that of a labourer. In China, the great ambition of every man is to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome little bit of land, either in property or in lea&s;e; and lea&s;es are there &s;aid to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be &s;uffi|ciently &s;ecured to the le&s;&s;ees. The Chine&s;e have little re&s;pect for foreign trade. Your beggarly commerce! was the language in which the Mandarins of Pekin u&s;ed to talk to Mr. Langlet, the Ru&s;&s;ian envoy, concerning it. Except with Japan, the Chine&s;e carry on them&s;elves and in their own bottoms little or no foreign trade; and it is only into one or two ports of their kingdom that they even admit the &s;hips of foreign nations. Foreign trade, therefore, is, in China, every way confined within a much nar|rower circle than that to which it would naturally extend it&s;elf, if more freedom was allowed to it, either in their own &s;hips, or in tho&s;e of foreign nations.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURES, as in a &s;mall bulk they frequently contain a great value, and can upon that account be tran&s;ported at le&s;s expence from one country to another than mo&s;t &s;orts of rude produce, are in almo&s;t all countries the principal &s;upport of foreign trade. In countries be&s;ides le&s;s exten&s;ive and le&s;s favourably circum|&s;tanced for interior commerce than China, they generally require the &s;upport of foreign trade. Without an exten&s;ive foreign market,
<PB N="280" REF="283">
they could not well flouri&s;h either in countries &s;o moderately exten|&s;ive as to afford but a narrow home market; or in countries where the communication between one province and another was &s;o difficult as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for the goods of any particular place to enjoy the whole of that home market which the country could afford. The perfection of manufacturing indu&s;try, it mu&s;t be remembered, depends altogether upon the divi&s;ion of labour; and the degree to which the divi&s;ion of labour can be introduced into any manufacture, is nece&s;&s;arily regulated, it has already been &s;hown, by the extent of the market. But the great extent of the empire of China, the va&s;t multitude of its inhabitants, the variety of climate, and con&s;equently of productions in its different provinces, and the ea&s;y communication by means of water carriage between the greater part of them, render the home market of that country of &s;o great extent, as to be alone &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport very great manufactures, and to admit of very con&s;iderable &s;ubdivi&s;ions of labour. The home market of China is perhaps in extent not much inferior to the market of all the different countries of Europe put together. A more exten&s;ive foreign trade, however, which to this great home market added the foreign market of all the re&s;t of the world; e&s;pecially if any con&s;iderable part of this trade was carried on in Chine&s;e &s;hips; could &s;carce fail to increa&s;e very much the manufactures of China, and to improve very much the productive powers of its manufac|turing indu&s;try. By a more exten&s;ive navigation, the Chine&s;e would naturally learn the art of u&s;ing and con&s;tructing them&s;elves all the different machines made u&s;e of in other countries, as well as all the other improvements of art and indu&s;try which are practi&s;ed in all the different parts of the world. Upon their pre&s;ent plan they have little opportunity of improving them&s;elves by the example of any other nation; except that of the Japane&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="284">
THE policy of antient Egypt too and that of the Gentoo govern|ment of Indo&s;tan &s;eem to have favoured agriculture more than all other employments.</P>
<P>BOTH in antient Egypt and in Indo&s;tan, the whole body of the people was divided into different ca&s;ts or tribes, each of which was confined, from father to &s;on, to a particular employment or cla&s;s of employments. The &s;on of a prie&s;t was nece&s;&s;arily a prie&s;t; the &s;on of a &s;oldier, a &s;oldier; the &s;on of a labourer, a labourer; the &s;on of a weaver, a weaver; the &s;on of a taylor, a taylor; &amp;c. In both countries, the ca&s;t of the prie&s;ts held the highe&s;t rank, and that of the &s;oldiers the next; and in both countries, the ca&s;t of the farmers and labourers was &s;uperior to the ca&s;ts of merchants and manufacturers.</P>
<P>THE government of both countries was particularly attentive to the intere&s;t of agriculture. The works con&s;tructed by the antient &s;overeigns of Egypt for the proper di&s;tribution of the waters of the Nile were famous in antiquity; and the ruined remains of &s;ome of them are &s;till the admiration of travellers. Tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind which were con&s;tructed by the antient &s;overeigns of Indo&s;tan, for the proper di&s;tribution of the waters of the Ganges as well as of many other rivers, though they have been le&s;s celebrated, &s;eem to have been equally great. Both countries accordingly, though &s;ubject occa&s;ionally to dearths, have been famous for their great fertility. Though both were extreamly populous, yet in years of moderate plenty they were both able to export great quantities of grain to their neighbours.</P>
<P>THE antient Egyptians had a &s;uper&s;titious aver&s;ion to the &s;ea; and as the Gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor con&s;equently to dre&s;s any victuals upon the water, it in
<PB N="282" REF="285">
effect prohibits them from all di&s;tant &s;ea voyages. Both the Egyptians and Indians mu&s;t have depended almo&s;t altogether upon the navi|gation of other nations for the exportation of their &s;urplus produce; and this dependency, as it mu&s;t have confined the market, &s;o it mu&s;t have di&s;couraged the increa&s;e of this &s;urplus produce. It mu&s;t have di&s;couraged too the increa&s;e of the manufactured produce more than that of the rude produce. Manufactures require a much more exten&s;ive market than the mo&s;t important parts of the rude produce of the land. A &s;ingle &s;hoemaker will make more than three hundred pairs of &s;hoes in the year; and his own family will not perhaps wear out &s;ix pairs. Unle&s;s therefore he has the cu&s;tom of at lea&s;t fifty &s;uch families as his own, he cannot di&s;po&s;e of the whole produce of his own labour. The mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s of artificers will &s;eldom, in a large country, make more than one in fifty or one in a hundred of the whole number of families contained in it. But in &s;uch large countries as France and England, the number of people employed in agriculture has by &s;ome authors been computed at a half, by others at a third, and by no author that I know of, at le&s;s than a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country. But as the produce of the agriculture of both France and England is, the far greater part of it, con&s;umed at home, each per&s;on employed in it mu&s;t, according to the&s;e computations, require little more than the cu&s;tom of one, two, or at mo&s;t four &s;uch families as his own, in order to di&s;po&s;e of the whole produce of his own labour. Agricul|ture, therefore, can &s;upport it&s;elf under the di&s;couragement of a confined market, much better than manufactures. In both antient Egypt and Indo&s;tan, indeed, the confinement of the foreign market was in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated by the conveniency of many inland navigations, which opened in the mo&s;t advantageous manner the whole extent of the home market to every part of the produce of every different di&s;trict of tho&s;e countries. The great extent of Indo&s;tan too rendered the home market of that
<PB N="283" REF="286">
country very great, and &s;ufficient to &s;upport a great variety of manu|factures. But the &s;mall extent of antient Egypt, which was never equal to England, mu&s;t at all times have rendered the home market of that country too narrow for &s;upporting any great variety of ma|nufactures. Bengal, accordingly, the province of Indo&s;tan which commonly exports the greate&s;t quantity of rice, has always been more remarkable for the exportation of a great variety of manufac|tures, than for that of its grain. Antient Egypt, on the contrary, though it exported &s;ome manufactures, fine linen in particular, as well as &s;ome other goods, was always mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for its great exportation of grain. It was long the granary of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different kingdoms into which Indo&s;tan has at different times been divided, have always derived the whole, or by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part, of their revenue from &s;ome &s;ort of land-tax or land-rent. This land-tax or land-rent, like the tithe in Europe, con&s;i&s;ted in a certain pro|portion, a fifth, it is &s;aid, of the produce of the land, which was either delivered in kind or paid in money, according to a certain valua|tion, and which therefore varied from year to year according to all the variations of the produce. It was natural, therefore, that the &s;overeigns of tho&s;e countries &s;hould be particularly attentive to the intere&s;ts of agriculture, upon the pro&s;perity or declen&s;ion of which immediately depended the yearly increa&s;e or diminution of their own revenue.</P>
<P>THE policy of the antient republicks of Greece, and that of Rome, though it honoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade, yet &s;eems rather to have di&s;couraged the latter employ|ments, than to have given any direct or intentional encouragement to the former. In &s;everal of the antient &s;tates of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited altogether; and in &s;everal others the employ|ments
<PB N="284" REF="287">
of artificers and manufacturers were con&s;idered as hurtful to the &s;trength and agility of the human body, as rendering it inca|pable of tho&s;e habits which their military and gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es endeavoured to form in it, and as thereby di&s;qualifying it more or le&s;s from undergoing the fatigues and encountering the dangers of war. Such occupations were con&s;idered as fit only for &s;laves, and the free citizens of the &s;tate were prohibited from exerci&s;ing them. Even in tho&s;e &s;tates where no &s;uch prohibition took place, as in Rome and Athens, the great body of the people were in effect excluded from all the trades which are now commonly exerci&s;ed by the lower &s;ort of the inhabitants of towns. Such trades were at Athens and Rome all occupied by the &s;laves of the rich, who exerci&s;ed them for the benefit of their ma&s;ters, who&s;e wealth, power and protection, made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a poor freeman to find a market for his work when it came into competition with that of the &s;laves of the rich. Slaves, however, are very &s;eldom inventive; and all the mo&s;t important improvements, either in machinery, or in that arrange|ment and di&s;tribution of work which facilitate and abridge labour, have been the di&s;coveries of freemen. Should a &s;lave propo&s;e any im|provement of this kind, his ma&s;ter would be very apt to con&s;ider the propo&s;al as the &s;ugge&s;tion of lazine&s;s, and of a de&s;ire to &s;ave his own labour at the ma&s;ter's expence. The poor &s;lave, in&s;tead of reward, would probably meet with much abu&s;e, perhaps with &s;ome puni&s;h|ment. In the manufactures carried on by &s;laves, therefore, more labour mu&s;t generally have been employed to execute the &s;ame quantity of work than in tho&s;e carried on by freemen. The work of the former mu&s;t, upon that account, generally have been dearer than that of the latter. The Hungarian mines, it is remarked by Mr. Monte&s;|quieu, though not more rich, have always been wrought with le&s;s expence, and therefore with more profit, than the Turki&s;h mines in their neighbourhood. The Turki&s;h mines are wrought by &s;laves; and the arms of tho&s;e &s;laves are the only machines which the Turks have ever thought of employing. The Hungarian
<PB N="285" REF="288">
mines are wrought by freemen, who employ a good deal of machinery, by which they facilitate and abridge their own labour. From the very little that is known about the price of manufactures in the times of the Greeks and Romans, it would appear that tho&s;e of the finer &s;ort were exce&s;&s;ively dear. Silk &s;old for its weight in gold. It was not, indeed, in tho&s;e times a European manufacture; and as it was all brought from the Ea&s;t Indies, the di&s;tance of the carriage may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the greatne&s;s of the price. The price, however, which a lady, it is &s;aid, would &s;ometimes pay for a piece of very fine linen &s;eems to have been equally extravagant; and as linen was always either a European, or, at farthe&s;t, an Egyptian manufacture, this high price can be accounted for only by the great expence of the labour which mu&s;t have been employed about it, and the expence of this labour again could ari&s;e from nothing but the aukwardne&s;s of the machinery which it made u&s;e of. The price of fine woollens too, though not quite &s;o extravagant, &s;eems however to have been much above that of the pre&s;ent times. Some cloths, we are told by Pliny, dyed in a particular manner, co&s;t a hundred denarii, or three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence, the pound weight. Others dyed in another manner co&s;t a thou&s;and denarii the pound weight, or thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence. The Roman pound, it mu&s;t be remembered, contained only twelve of our averdupois ounces. This high price, indeed, &s;eems to have been principally owing to the dye. But had not the cloths them&s;elves been much dearer than any which are made in the pre&s;ent times, &s;o very expen&s;ive a dye would not probably have been be&s;towed upon them. The di&s;pro|portion would have been too great between the value of the acce&s;|&s;ory and that of the principal. The price mentioned by the &s;ame author of &s;ome Triclinaria, a &s;ort of woollen pillows or cu&s;hions made u&s;e of to lean upon as they reclined upon their couches at table, pa&s;&s;es all credibility; &s;ome of them being &s;aid to have co&s;t more than thirty thou&s;and, others more than three hundred thou|&s;and
<PB N="286" REF="289">
pounds. This high price too is not &s;aid to have ari&s;en from the dye. In the dre&s;s of the people of fa&s;hion of both &s;exes, there &s;eems to have been much le&s;s variety, it is ob&s;erved by Doctor Arbuthnot, in antient than in modern times; and the very little variety which we find in that of the antient &s;tatues confirms his ob&s;ervation. He infers from this, that their dre&s;s mu&s;t upon the whole have been cheaper than ours: but the conclu&s;ion does not &s;eem to follow. When the expence of fa&s;hionable dre&s;s is very great, the variety mu&s;t be very &s;mall. But when, by the improvements in the productive powers of manufacturing art and indu&s;try, the expence of any one dre&s;s comes to be very moderate, the variety will naturally be very great. The rich, not being able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by the expence of any one dre&s;s, will naturally endeavour to do &s;o by the multitude and variety of their dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t and mo&s;t important branch of the commerce of every nation, it has already been ob&s;erved, is that which is carried on between the inhabitants of the town and tho&s;e of the country. The inhabitants of the town draw from the country the rude produce which con&s;titutes both the materials of their work and the fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and they pay for this rude produce by &s;ending back to the country a certain portion of it manufactured and prepared for immediate u&s;e. The trade which is carried on between tho&s;e two different &s;ets of people con&s;i&s;ts ultimately in a certain quantity of rude produce exchanged for a certain quan|tity of manufactured produce. The dearer the latter, there|fore, the cheaper the former; and whatever tends in any coun|try to rai&s;e the price of manufactured produce, tends to lower that of the rude produce of the land, and thereby to di&s;courage agriculture. The &s;maller the quantity of manufactured produce which any given quantity of rude produce, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, which the price of any given quantity of rude produce is capable of purcha&s;ing, the &s;maller the real value of that given
<PB N="287" REF="290">
quantity of rude produce; the &s;maller the encouragement which either the landlord has to increa&s;e its quantity by improving, or the farmer by cultivating the land. Whatever, be&s;ides, tends to dimi|ni&s;h in any country the number of artificers and manufacturers, tends to dimini&s;h the home market, the mo&s;t important of all markets, for the rude produce of the land, and thereby &s;till further to di&s;courage agriculture.</P>
<P>THOSE &s;y&s;tems, therefore, which preferring agriculture to all other employments, in order to promote it impo&s;e re&s;traints upon manufactures and foreign trade, act contrary to the very end which they propo&s;e, and indirectly di&s;courage that very &s;pecies of indu&s;try which they mean to promote. They are &s;o far, perhaps, more incon&s;i&s;tent than even the mercantile &s;y&s;tem. That &s;y&s;tem, by encouraging manufactures and foreign trade more than agriculture, turns a certain portion of the capital of the &s;ociety from &s;upporting a more advantageous, to &s;upport a le&s;s advantageous &s;pecies of indu&s;try. But &s;till it really and in the end encourages that &s;pecies of indu&s;try which it means to promote. Tho&s;e agricultural &s;y&s;tems, on the contrary, really and in the end di&s;courage their own favourite &s;pecies of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IT is thus that every &s;y&s;tem which endeavours, either, by extraor|dinary encouragements, to draw towards a particular &s;pecies of indu&s;try a greater &s;hare of the capital of the &s;ociety than what would naturally go to it; or, by extraordinary re&s;traints, to force from a particular &s;pecies of indu&s;try &s;ome &s;hare of the capital which would otherwi&s;e be employed in it; is in reality &s;ubver&s;ive of the great purpo&s;e which it means to promote. It retards, in&s;tead of accelerating, the progre&s;s of the &s;ociety towards real wealth and greatne&s;s; and dimini&s;hes, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, the real value of the annual produce of its land and labour.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="291">
ALL &s;y&s;tems either of preference or of re&s;traint, therefore, being thus completely taken away, the obvious and &s;imple &s;y&s;tem of natural liberty e&s;tabli&s;hes it&s;elf of its own accord. Every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of ju&s;tice, is left perfectly free to pur&s;ue his own intere&s;t his own way, and to bring both his indu&s;try and capital into competition with tho&s;e of any other man or order of men. The &s;overeign is completely di&s;charged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he mu&s;t always be expo&s;ed to innumerable delu&s;ions, and for the proper performance of which no human wi&s;dom or knowledge could ever be &s;ufficient; the duty of &s;uper-intending the indu&s;try of private people, and of directing it towards the employments mo&s;t &s;uitable to the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety. According to the &s;y&s;tem of natural liberty, the &s;ove|reign has only three duties to attend to; three duties of great import|ance, indeed, but plain and intelligible to common under&s;tandings: fir&s;t, the duty of protecting the &s;ociety from the violence and inva&s;ion of other independent &s;ocieties; &s;econdly, the duty of protecting, as far as po&s;&s;ible, every member of the &s;ociety from the inju&s;tice or oppre&s;&s;ion of every other member of it, or the duty of e&s;tabli&s;hing an exact admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and, thirdly, the duty of erect|ing and maintaining certain publick works and certain publick in&s;titutions, which it can never be for the intere&s;t of any indivi|dual, or &s;mall number of individuals, to erect and maintain; becau&s;e the profit could never repay the expence to any individual or &s;mall number of individuals, though it may frequently do much more than repay it to a great &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE proper performance of tho&s;e &s;everal duties of the &s;overeign nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es a certain expence; and this expence again nece&s;&s;arily requires a certain revenue to &s;upport it. In the following book, therefore, I &s;hall endeavour to explain; fir&s;t, what are the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the &s;overeign or common-wealth; and which
<PB N="289" REF="292">
of tho&s;e expences ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety; and which of them, by that of &s;ome par|ticular part only, or of &s;ome particular members of the &s;ociety: &s;econdly, what are the different methods in which the whole &s;ociety may be made to contribute towards defraying the expences incumbent on the whole &s;ociety, and what are the principal advan|tages and inconveniences of each of tho&s;e methods: and, thirdly, what are the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es which have induced almo&s;t all modern governments to mortgage &s;ome part of this reve|nue, or to contract debts, and what have been the effects of tho&s;e debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety. The following book, therefore, will naturally be divided into three chapters.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t duty of the &s;overeign, that of protecting the &s;ociety from the violence and inva&s;ion of other independent &s;ocieties, can be performed only by means of a military force. But the expence both of preparing this military force in time of peace, and of employing it in time of war, is very different in the different &s;tates of &s;ociety, in the different periods of improvement.</P>
<P>AMONG nations of hunters, the lowe&s;t and rude&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety, &s;uch as we find it among the native tribes of North America, every man is a warrior as well as a hunter. When he goes to war, either to defend his &s;ociety, or to revenge the injuries which have been done to it by other &s;ocieties, he maintains him&s;elf by his own labour in the &s;ame manner as when he lives at home. His &s;ociety, for in this &s;tate of things there is properly neither &s;overeign nor com|monwealth, is at no &s;ort of expence, either to prepare him for the field, or to maintain him while he is in it.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294">
AMONG nations of &s;hepherds, a more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, &s;uch as we find it among the Tartars and Arabs, every man is, in the &s;ame manner, a warrior. Such nations have commonly no fixed habitation, but live either in tents or in a &s;ort of covered waggons which are ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from place to place. The whole tribe or nation changes its &s;ituation according to the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, as well as according to other accidents. When its herds and flocks have con&s;umed the forage of one part of the country, it removes to another, and from that to a third. In the dry &s;ea&s;on, it comes down to the banks of the rivers; in the wet &s;ea&s;on it retires to the upper country. When &s;uch a nation goes to war, the warriors will not tru&s;t their herds and flocks to the feeble defence of their old men, their women and children; and their old men, their women and children, will not be left behind without defence and without &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The whole nation, be&s;ides, being accu&s;tomed to a wandering life, even in time of peace, ea&s;ily takes the field in time of war. Whether it marches as an army, or moves about as a company of herd&s;men, the way of life is nearly the &s;ame, though the object propo&s;ed by it is very different. They all go to war together, therefore, and every one does as well as he can. Among the Tartars, even the women have been frequently known to engage in battle. If they conquer, whatever belongs to the ho&s;tile tribe is the recompence of the victory. But if they are vanqui&s;hed, all is lo&s;t, and not only their herds and flocks, but their women and children become the booty of the conqueror. Even the greater part of tho&s;e who &s;urvive the action are obliged to &s;ubmit to him for the &s;ake of immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The re&s;t are commonly di&s;&s;i|pated and di&s;per&s;ed in the de&s;art.</P>
<P>THE ordinary life, the ordinary exerci&s;es of a Tartar or Arab, prepare him &s;ufficiently for war. Running, wre&s;tling, cudgel-play|ing, throwing the javeling, drawing the bow, &amp;c. are the common
<PB N="293" REF="295">
pa&s;times of tho&s;e who live in the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or Arab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks which he carries with him, in the &s;ame manner as in peace. His chief or &s;overeign, for tho&s;e nations have all chiefs or &s;overeigns, is at no fort of expence in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it, the chance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or requires.</P>
<P>AN army of hunters can &s;eldom exceed two or three hundred men. The precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which the chace affords could &s;eldom allow a greater number to keep together for any con&s;iderable time. An army of &s;hepherds, on the contrary, may &s;ometimes amount to two or three hundred thou&s;and. As long as nothing &s;tops their progre&s;s, as long as they can go on from one di&s;trict, of which they have con&s;umed the forage, to another which is yet entire; there &s;eems to be &s;carce any limit to the number who can march on together. A nation of hunters can never be formi|dable to the civilized nations in their neighbourhood. A nation of &s;hepherds may. Nothing can be more contemptible than an Indian war in North America. Nothing, on the contrary, can be more dreadful than a Tartar inva&s;ion has frequently been in A&s;ia. The judgement of Thucidides, that both Europe and A&s;ia could not re&s;i&s;t the Scythians united, has been verified by the experience of all ages. The inhabitants of the exten&s;ive, but defencele&s;s plains of Scythia or Tartary, have been frequently united under the dominion of the chief of &s;ome conquering horde or clan; and the havock and deva&s;tation of A&s;ia have always &s;ignalized their union. The inha|bitants of the inho&s;pitable de&s;arts of Arabia, the other great nation of &s;hepherds, have never been united but once; under Mahomet and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Their union, which was more the effect of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m than of conque&s;t, was &s;ignalized in the &s;ame manner. If the hunting nations of America

&s;hould ever become &s;hepherds, their neighbourhood would be much more dangerous to the European colonies than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN a yet more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, among tho&s;e nations of hu&s;bandmen who have little foreign commerce and no other manu|factures but tho&s;e coar&s;e and hou&s;hold ones which almo&s;t every private family prepares for its own u&s;e, every man, in the &s;ame manner, either is a warrior or ea&s;ily becomes &s;uch. They who live by agriculture generally pa&s;s the whole day in the open air, expo&s;ed to all the inclemencies of the &s;ea&s;ons. The hardine&s;s of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war, to &s;ome of which their nece&s;&s;ary occupations bear a good deal of analogy. The nece&s;&s;ary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the trenches, and to fortify a camp as well as to enclo&s;e a field. The ordinary pa&s;times of &s;uch hu&s;bandmen are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of &s;hepherds, and are in the &s;ame manner the images of war. But as hu&s;bandmen have le&s;s lei&s;ure than &s;hepherds, they are not &s;o frequently employed in tho&s;e pa&s;times. They are &s;oldiers, but &s;oldiers not quite &s;o much ma&s;ters of their exerci&s;e. Such as they are, however, it &s;eldom co&s;ts the &s;overeign or commonwealth any expence to prepare them for the field.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE, even in its rude&s;t and lowe&s;t &s;tate, &s;uppo&s;es a &s;ettlement; &s;ome &s;ort of fixed habitation which cannot be abandoned without great lo&s;s. When a nation of mere hu&s;bandmen, therefore, goes to war, the whole people cannot take the field together. The old men, the women and children, at lea&s;t mu&s;t remain at home to take care of the habitation. All the men of the military age, however, may take the field, and in &s;mall nations of this kind have frequently done &s;o. In every nation the men of the military age are &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to about a fourth or fifth part of the whole body of the people. If the campaign too &s;hould begin after &s;eed
<PB N="295" REF="297">
time and end before harve&s;t, both the hu&s;bandman and his prin|cipal labourers can be &s;pared from the farm without much lo&s;s. He tru&s;ts that the work which mu&s;t be done in the meantime can be well enough executed by the old men, the women and the children. He is not unwilling, therefore, to &s;erve without pay during &s;o &s;hort a campaign, and it frequently co&s;ts the &s;overeign or commonwealth as little to maintain him in the field as to prepare him for it. The citizens of all the different &s;tates of antient Greece &s;eem to have &s;erved in this manner till after the &s;econd Per&s;ian war; and the people of Pelopone&s;us till after the Pelopone&s;ian war. The Pelopone&s;ians, Thucidides ob&s;erves, generally left the field in the &s;ummer and returned home to reap the harve&s;t. The Roman people under their kings and during the fir&s;t ages of the republick &s;erved in the &s;ame manner. It was not till the &s;iege of Veii, that they who &s;taid at home began to contribute &s;omething towards maintaining tho&s;e who went to war. In the European monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, both before and for &s;ome time after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of what is properly called the feudal law, the great lords with all their immediate dependents u&s;ed to &s;erve the crown at their own expence. In the field, in the &s;ame manner as at home, they maintained them&s;elves by their own revenue, and not by any &s;tipend or pay which they received from the king upon that particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN a more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, two different cau&s;es contri|bute to render it altogether impo&s;&s;ible that they who take the field &s;hould maintain them&s;elves at their own expence. Tho&s;e two cau&s;es are, the progre&s;s of manufactures, and the improvement in the art of war.</P>
<P>THOUGH a hu&s;bandman &s;hould be employed in an expedition, provided it begins after &s;eed time and ends before harve&s;t, the inter|ruption
<PB N="296" REF="298">
of his bu&s;ine&s;s will not always occa&s;ion any con&s;iderable diminution of his revenue. Without the intervention of his labour, nature does her&s;elf the greater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that an artificer, a &s;mith, a car|penter, or a weaver, for example, quits his workhou&s;e, the &s;ole &s;ource of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature does nothing for him, he does all for him&s;elf. When he takes the field, there|fore, in defence of the publick, as he has no revenue to maintain him&s;elf, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be maintained by the publick. But in a country of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and manufacturers, a great part of the people who go to war mu&s;t be drawn from tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, and mu&s;t therefore be maintained by the publick as long as they are employed in its &s;ervice.</P>
<P>WHEN the art of war too has gradually grown up to be a very intri|cate and complicated &s;cience, when the event of war cea&s;es to be de|termined, as in the fir&s;t ages of &s;ociety, by a &s;ingle irregular &s;kirmi&s;h or battle, but when the conte&s;t is generally &s;pun out through &s;everal different campaigns, each of which la&s;ts during the greater part of the year; it becomes univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary that the publick &s;hould main|tain tho&s;e who &s;erve the publick in war, at lea&s;t while they are employed in that &s;ervice. Whatever in time of peace might be the ordinary occupation of tho&s;e who go to war, &s;o very tedious and expen&s;ive a &s;ervice would otherwi&s;e be by far too heavy a burden upon them. After the &s;econd Per&s;ian war, accordingly, the armies of Athens &s;eem to have been generally compo&s;ed of mercenary troops; con&s;i&s;ting indeed partly of citizens, but partly too of foreigners; and all of them equally hired and paid at the expence of the &s;tate. From the time of the &s;eige of Veii the armies of Rome received pay for their &s;ervice during the time which they remained in the field. Under the feudal governments the military &s;ervice both of the great lords and of their immediate dependents
<PB N="297" REF="299">
was, after a certain period, univer&s;ally exchanged for a payment in money, which was employed to maintain tho&s;e who &s;erved in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>THE number of tho&s;e who can go to war, in proportion to the whole number of the people, is nece&s;&s;arily much &s;maller in a civi|lized than in a rude &s;tate of &s;ociety. In a civilized &s;ociety, as the &s;oldiers are maintained altogether by the labour of tho&s;e who are not &s;oldiers, the number of the former never can exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above maintaining in a manner &s;uitable to their re&s;pective &s;tations both them&s;elves and the other officers of government, and law, whom they are obliged to maintain. In the little Agrarian &s;tates of antient Greece, a fourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people con&s;idered them&s;elves as &s;oldiers, and would &s;ometimes, it is &s;aid, take the field. Among the civilized nations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed, that not more than one hundredth part of the inhabitants of any country can be employed as &s;oldiers, without ruin to the country at who&s;e expence they are employed.</P>
<P>THE expence of preparing the army for the field &s;eems not to have become con&s;iderable in any nation, till long after that of main|taining it in the field had devolved entirely upon the &s;overeign or commonwealth. In all the different republicks of antient Greece, to learn his military exerci&s;es was a nece&s;&s;ary part of education impo&s;ed by the &s;tate upon every free citizen. In every city there &s;eems to have been a publick field, in which, under the protec|tion of the publick magi&s;trate, the young people were taught their different exerci&s;es by different ma&s;ters. In this very &s;imple in&s;titution con&s;i&s;ted the whole expence which any Grecian &s;tate &s;eems ever to have been at in preparing its citizens for war. In antient Rome the exerci&s;es of the Campus Martius an&s;wered the
<PB N="298" REF="300">
&s;ame purpo&s;e with tho&s;e of the Gymna&s;ium in antient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the many publick ordinances that the citizens of every di&s;trict &s;hould practi&s;e archery as well as &s;everal other military exerci&s;es, were intended for promoting the &s;ame purpo&s;e, but do not &s;eem to have promoted it &s;o well. Either from want of intere&s;t in the officers entru&s;ted with the execution of tho&s;e ordinances, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, they appear to have been univer&s;ally neglected; and in the progre&s;s of all tho&s;e governments, military exerci&s;es &s;eem to have gone gradually into di&s;u&s;e among the great body of the people.</P>
<P>IN the republicks of antient Greece and Rome, during the whole period of their exi&s;tence, and under the feudal governments for a con&s;iderable time after their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, the trade of a &s;oldier was not a &s;eparate di&s;tinct trade which con&s;tituted the &s;ole or principal occupation of a particular cla&s;s of citizens. Every &s;ubject of the &s;tate, whatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by which he gained his livelihood, con&s;idered him&s;elf upon all ordi|nary occa&s;ions as fit likewi&s;e to exerci&s;e the trade of a &s;oldier, and upon many extraordinary occa&s;ions as bound to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P>THE art of war, however, as it is certainly the noble&s;t of all arts, &s;o in the progre&s;s of improvement it nece&s;&s;arily becomes one of the mo&s;t complicated among them. The &s;tate of the mechanical, as well as of &s;ome other arts with which it is nece&s;&s;arily connected, determines the degree of perfection to which it is capable of being carried at any particular time. But in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould become the &s;ole or principal occupation of a particular cla&s;s of citizens, and the divi|&s;ion of labour is as nece&s;&s;ary for the improvement of this as of every other art. Into other arts the divi&s;ion of labour is naturally introduced by the prudence of individuals, who find that they
<PB N="299" REF="301">
promote their private intere&s;t better by confining them&s;elves to a particular trade, than by exerci&s;ing a great number. But it is the wi&s;dom of the &s;tate only which can render the trade of a &s;oldier a particular trade &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from all others. A private citizen who, in time of profound peace and without any particular encouragement from the publick, &s;hould &s;pend the greater part of his time in military exerci&s;es, might, no doubt, both improve him|&s;elf very much in them, and amu&s;e him&s;elf very well; but he cer|tainly would not promote his own intere&s;t. It is the wi&s;dom of the &s;tate only which can render it for his intere&s;t to give up the greater part of his time to this peculiar occupation: and &s;tates have not always had this wi&s;dom, even when their circum&s;tances had become &s;uch that the pre&s;ervation of their exi&s;tence required that they &s;hould have it.</P>
<P>A SHEPHERD has a great deal of lei&s;ure; a hu&s;bandman, in the rude &s;tate of hu&s;bandry, has &s;ome; an artificer or manufacturer has none at all. The fir&s;t may, without any lo&s;s, employ a great deal of his time in martial exerci&s;es; the &s;econd may employ &s;ome part of it; but the la&s;t cannot employ a &s;ingle hour in them with|out &s;ome lo&s;s, and his attention to his own intere&s;t naturally leads him to neglect them altogether. Tho&s;e improvements in hu&s;bandry too, which the progre&s;s of arts and manufactures nece&s;&s;arily intro|duces, leave the hu&s;bandman as little lei&s;ure as the artificer. Mili|tary exerci&s;es come to be as much neglected by the inhabitants of the country as by tho&s;e of the town, and the great body of the people becomes altogether unwarlike. That wealth, at the &s;ame time, which always follows the improvements of agriculture and manu|factures, and which in reality is no more than the accumulated produce of tho&s;e improvements, provokes the inva&s;ion of all their neighbours. An indu&s;trious, and upon that account, a wealthy nation, is of all nations the mo&s;t likely to be attacked; and unle&s;s the &s;tate
<PB N="300" REF="302">
takes &s;ome new mea&s;ures for the publick defence, the natural habits of the people render them altogether incapable of defending them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e circum&s;tances there &s;eem to be but two methods by which the &s;tate can make any tolerable provi&s;ion for the publick defence.</P>
<P>IT may either, fir&s;t, by means of a very rigorous police, and in &s;pite of the whole bent of the intere&s;t, genius and inclinations of the people, enforce the practice of military exerci&s;es, and oblige either all the citizens of the military age, or a certain number of them, to join in &s;ome mea&s;ure the trade of a &s;oldier to whatever other trade or profe&s;&s;ion they may happen to carry on.</P>
<P>OR, &s;econdly, by maintaining and employing a certain number of citizens in the con&s;tant practice of military exerci&s;es, it may render the trade of a &s;oldier a particular trade, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from all others.</P>
<P>IF the &s;tate has recour&s;e to the fir&s;t of tho&s;e two expedients, its military force is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in a militia; if to the &s;econd, it is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in a &s;tanding army. The practice of military exerci&s;es is the &s;ole or principal occupation of the &s;oldiers of a &s;tanding army, and the maintenance or pay which the &s;tate affords them is the prin|cipal and ordinary fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The practice of military exerci&s;es is only the occa&s;ional occupation of the &s;oldiers of a militia, and they derive the principal and ordinary fund of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from &s;ome other occupation. In a militia, the charac|ter of the labourer, artificer or trade&s;man, predominates over that of the &s;oldier: in a &s;tanding army, that of the &s;oldier predominates over every other character; and in this di&s;tinction &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t
<PB N="301" REF="303">
the e&s;&s;ential difference between tho&s;e two different &s;pecies of mili|tary force.</P>
<P>MILITIAS have been of &s;everal different kinds. In &s;ome coun|tries the citizens de&s;tined for defending the &s;tate, &s;eem to have been exerci&s;ed only, without being, if I may &s;ay &s;o, regimented; that is, without being divided into &s;eparate and di&s;tinct bodies of troops, each of which performed its exerci&s;es under its own proper and per|manent officers. In the republicks of antient Greece and Rome each citizen, as long as he remained at home, &s;eems to have practi&s;ed his exerci&s;es either &s;eparately and independently, or with &s;uch of his equals as he liked be&s;t; and not to have been attached to any particular body of troops till he was actually called upon to take the field. In other countries, the militia has not only been exerci&s;ed, but regimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I believe, in every other country of modern Europe, where any imperfect military force of this kind has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, every mili|tia-man is, even in time of peace, attached to a particular body of troops, which performs its exerci&s;es under its own proper and perma|nent officers.</P>
<P>BEFORE the invention of fire-arms, that army was &s;uperior in which the &s;oldiers had, each individually, the greate&s;t &s;kill and dexte|rity in the u&s;e of their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, and commonly determined the fate of battles. But this &s;kill and dexterity in the u&s;e of their arms, could be acquired only in the &s;ame manner as fencing is acquired at pre&s;ent, by prac|ti&s;ing, not in great bodies, but each man &s;eparately, in a particular &s;chool under a particular ma&s;ter, or with his own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of fire-arms, &s;trength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity and &s;kill in the u&s;e of arms, though they are far from being of no con&s;equence, are, however, of le&s;s con&s;equence. The nature of the weapon, though
<PB N="302" REF="304">
it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the &s;kilful, puts him more nearly &s;o than he ever was before. All the dexterity and &s;kill, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, which are nece&s;&s;ary for u&s;ing it, can be well enough acquired by practi&s;ing in great bodies.</P>
<P>REGULARITY, order, and prompt obedience to command, are qualities which, in modern armies, are of more importance towards determining the fate of battles than the dexterity and &s;kill of the &s;oldiers in the u&s;e of their arms. But the noi&s;e of fire-arms, the &s;moke, and the invi&s;ible death to which every man feels him&s;elf every moment expo&s;ed, as &s;oon as he comes within cannon-&s;hot, and frequently a long time before the battle can be well &s;aid to be engaged, mu&s;t render it very difficult to maintain any con&s;iderable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience, even in the beginning of a modern battle. In an antient battle there was no noi&s;e but what aro&s;e from the human voice; there was no &s;moke, there was no invi&s;ible cau&s;e of wounds or death. Every man, till &s;ome mortal weapon actually did approach him, &s;aw clearly that no &s;uch weapon was near him. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, and among troops who had &s;ome confidence in their own &s;kill and dexterity in the u&s;e of their arms, it mu&s;t have been a good deal le&s;s difficult to pre&s;erve &s;ome degree of regularity and order, not only in the beginning, but through the whole progre&s;s of an antient battle, and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits of regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, can be acquired only by troops which are exerci&s;ed in great bodies.</P>
<P>A MILITIA, however, in whatever manner it may be either di&s;ciplined or exerci&s;ed, mu&s;t always be much inferior to a well di&s;ciplined and well exerci&s;ed &s;tanding army.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers, who are exerci&s;ed only once a week or once a month, can never be &s;o expert in the u&s;e of their arms, as tho&s;e
<PB N="303" REF="305">
who are exerci&s;ed every day or every other day; and though this circum&s;tance may not be of &s;o much con&s;equence in modern, as it was in antient times; yet the acknowledged &s;uperiority of the Pru&s;|&s;ian troops, owing, it is &s;aid, very much to their &s;uperior expert|ne&s;s in their exerci&s;e, may &s;atisfy us that it is, even at this day, of very con&s;iderable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers, who are bound to obey their officer only once a week or once a month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their own affairs their own way, without being in any re&s;pect accountable to him, can never be under the &s;ame awe in his pre&s;ence; can never have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to ready obedience, with tho&s;e who&s;e whole life and conduct are every day directed by him, and who every day even ri&s;e and go to bed, or at lea&s;t retire to their quarters, according to his orders. In what is called di&s;cipline, or in the habit of ready obedience, a militia mu&s;t always be &s;till more inferior to a &s;tanding army, than it may &s;ometimes be in what is called the manual exerci&s;e, or in the management and u&s;e of its arms. But in modern war the habit of ready and in&s;tant obedience is of much greater con&s;equence than a con&s;iderable &s;uperiority in the management of arms.</P>
<P>THOSE militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under the &s;ame chieftains whom they are accu&s;tomed to obey in peace, are by far the be&s;t. In re&s;pect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, they approach neare&s;t to &s;tanding armies. The highland militia, when it &s;erved under its own chieftains, had &s;ome advantage of the &s;ame kind. As the highlanders, however, were not wandering, but &s;tationary &s;hepherds, as they had all a fixed habitation, and were not, in peaceable times, accu&s;tomed to follow their chieftain from place to place; &s;o in time of war they were le&s;s willing to follow him to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance, or to continue for any long time in the field. When they had acquired any booty
<PB N="304" REF="306">
they were eager to return home, and his authority was &s;eldom &s;uf|ficient to detain them. In point of obedience they were always much inferior to what is reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the highlanders too, from their &s;tationary life, &s;pend le&s;s of their time in the open air, they were always le&s;s accu&s;tomed to military exerci&s;es, and were le&s;s expert in the u&s;e of their arms than the Tartars and Arabs are &s;aid to be.</P>
<P>A MILITIA of any kind, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, which has &s;erved for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive campaigns in the field, becomes in every re&s;pect a &s;tanding army. The &s;oldiers are every day exerci&s;ed in the u&s;e of their arms, and, being con&s;tantly under the command of their officers, are habituated to the &s;ame prompt obedience which takes place in &s;tanding armies. What they were before they took the field, is of little importance. They nece&s;&s;arily become in every re&s;pect a &s;tanding army, after they have pa&s;&s;ed a few cam|paigns in it. Should the war in America drag out through another campaign, the American militia may become in every re&s;pect a match for that &s;tanding army, of which, in the la&s;t war, the valour appeared at lea&s;t not inferior to that of the hardie&s;t veterans of France and Spain.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;tinction being well under&s;tood, the hi&s;tory of all ages, it will be found, bears te&s;timony to the irre&s;i&s;tible &s;uperiority which a well regulated &s;tanding army has over every &s;ort of militia.</P>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t &s;tanding armies of which we have any di&s;tinct account, in any well authenticated hi&s;tory, is that of Philip of Macedon. His frequent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, The&s;|&s;alians, and &s;ome of the Greek cities in the neighbourhood of Ma|cedon, gradually formed his troops, which in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact di&s;cipline of a &s;tanding army. When he was at peace, which he was very &s;eldom, and never for any
<PB N="305" REF="307">
long time together, he was careful not to di&s;band that army. vanqui&s;hed and &s;ubdued, after a long and violent &s;truggle indeed, the galant and well exerci&s;ed militias of the principal republicks of antient Greece; and afterwards, with very little &s;truggle, the effeminate and ill exerci&s;ed militia of the great Per&s;ian empire. The fall of the Greek republicks and of the Per&s;ian empire, was the effect of the irre&s;i&s;table &s;uperiority which a &s;tanding army has over every &s;ort of militia. It is the fir&s;t great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which hi&s;tory has pre&s;erved any di&s;tinct or circum|&s;tantial account.</P>
<P>THE fall of Carthage, and the con&s;equent elevation of Rome, is the &s;econd. All the varieties in the fortune of tho&s;e two famous republicks may very well be accounted for from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>FROM the end of the fir&s;t to the beginning of the &s;econd Cartha|ginian war, the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed under three great generals, who &s;ucceeded one ano|ther in the command; Amilcar, his &s;on in law A&s;drubal, and his &s;on Annibal; fir&s;t in cha&s;ti&s;ing their own rebellious &s;laves, after|wards in &s;ubduing the revolted nations of Africa, and, la&s;tly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain. The army which Anni|bal led from Spain into Italy mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in tho&s;e different wars, have been gradually formed to the exact di&s;cipline of a &s;tand|ing army. The Romans in the mean time, though they had not been altogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in any war of very great con&s;equence; and their military di&s;cipline, it is generally &s;aid, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Annibal encountered at Trebia, Thra&s;ymenus, and Cannae, were militia oppo&s;ed to a &s;tanding army. This circum|&s;tance, it is probable, contributed more than any other to deter|mine the fate of tho&s;e battles.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="308">
THE &s;tanding army which Annibal left behind him in Spain, had the like &s;uperiority over the militia which the Romans &s;ent to oppo&s;e it, and in a few years, under the command of his brother, the younger A&s;drubal, expelled them almo&s;t entirely from that country.</P>
<P>ANNIBAL was ill &s;upplied from home. The Roman militia, being continually in the field, became in the progre&s;s of the war a well di&s;ciplined and well exerci&s;ed &s;tanding army; and the &s;upe|riority of Annibal grew every day le&s;s and le&s;s. A&s;drubal judged it nece&s;&s;ary to lead the whole, or almo&s;t the whole of the &s;tanding army which he commanded in Spain, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his bro|ther in Italy. In his march he is &s;aid to have been mi&s;led by his guides; and in a country which he did not know, was &s;urprized and attacked by another &s;tanding army, in every re&s;pect equal or &s;uperior to his own, and was entirely defeated.</P>
<P>WHEN A&s;drubal had left Spain, the great Scipio found nothing to oppo&s;e him but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and &s;ubdued that militia, and, in the cour&s;e of the war, his own militia nece&s;&s;arily became a well di&s;ciplined and well exerci&s;ed &s;tand|ing army. That &s;tanding army was afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to oppo&s;e it. In order to defend Carthage it became nece&s;&s;ary to recall the &s;tanding army of Annibal. The di&s;heartened and frequently defeated African militia joined it, and, at the battle of Zama, compo&s;ed the greater part of the troops of Annibal. The event of that day determined the fate of the two rival republicks.</P>
<P>FROM the end of the &s;econd Carthaginian war till the fall of the Roman republick, the armies of Rome were in every re&s;pect &s;tanding armies. The &s;tanding army of Macedon made &s;ome
<PB N="307" REF="309">
re&s;i&s;tance to their arms. In the height of their grandeur it co&s;t them two great wars, and three great battles, to &s;ubdue that little kingdom; of which the conque&s;t would probably have been &s;till more difficult, had it not been for the cowardice of its la&s;t king. The militias of all the civilized nations of the ancient world, of Greece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;tanding armies of Rome. The militias of &s;ome barbarous nations defended them&s;elves much better. The Scythian or Tar|tar militia, which Mithridates drew from the countries north of the Euxine and Ca&s;pian &s;eas, were the mo&s;t formidable enemies which the Romans had to encounter after the &s;econd Carthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias too were always re&s;pect|able, and, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, gained very con&s;iderable advan|tages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when the Roman armies were well commanded, they appear to have been very much &s;uperior; and if the Romans did not pur&s;ue the final conque&s;t either of Parthia or Germany, it was probably becau&s;e they judged that it was not worth while to add tho&s;e two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too large. The antient Parthians appear to have been a nation of Scythian or Tartar, extraction, and to have always retained a good deal of the manners of their ance&s;tors. The ancient Germans were, like the Scythians or Tartars, a nation of wandering &s;hepherds, who went to war under the &s;ame chiefs whom they were accu&s;tomed to follow in peace. Their militia was exactly of the &s;ame kind with that of the Scythians or Tartars, from whom too they were probably de&s;cended.</P>
<P>MANY different cau&s;es contributed to relax the di&s;cipline of the Roman armies. Its extreme &s;everity was, perhaps, one of tho&s;e cau&s;es. In the days of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of oppo&s;ing them, their heavy armour was laid a&s;ide as
<PB N="308" REF="310">
unnece&s;&s;arily burden&s;ome, their laborious exerci&s;es were neglected as unnece&s;&s;arily toil&s;ome. Under the Roman emperors be&s;ides, the &s;tanding armies of Rome, tho&s;e particularly which guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to their ma&s;ters, again&s;t whom they u&s;ed frequently to &s;et up their own generals. In order to render them le&s;s formidable, according to &s;ome authors, Dioele&s;ian, according to others, Con&s;tantine, fir&s;t; withdrew them from the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in great bodies, generally of two or three legions each, and di&s;per&s;ed them in &s;mall bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence they were &s;carce ever removed, but when it became nece&s;&s;ary to repel an inva&s;ion. Small bo|dies of &s;oldiers quartered in trading and manufacturing towns, and &s;eldom removed from tho&s;e quarters, became them&s;elves, trade&s;men, artificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to pre|dominate over the military character; and the &s;tanding armies of Rome gradually degenerated into a corrupt, neglected, and undi&s;|ciplined militia, incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the attack of the German and Scythian militias, which &s;oon afterwards invaded the we&s;tern empire. It was only by hiring the militia of &s;ome of tho&s;e nations, to oppo&s;e to that of others, that the emperors were for &s;ome time able to defend them&s;elves. The fall of the we&s;tern empire is the third great revolution in the affairs of mankind, of which antient hi&s;tory has pre&s;erved any di&s;tinct or circum&s;tantial account. It was brought about by the irre&s;i&s;table &s;uperiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation; which the militia of a nation of &s;hepherds has over that of a nation of hu&s;|bandmen, artificers, and manufacturers. The victories which have been gained by militias have generally been, not over &s;tanding armies, but over other militias in exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline inferior to them&s;elves. Such were the victories which the Greek militia gained over that of the Per&s;ian empire; and &s;uch too were tho&s;e which
<PB N="309" REF="311">
in later times the Swi&s;s militia gained over that of the Au&s;trians and Burgundians.</P>
<P>THE military force of the German and Scythian nations who e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves upon the ruins of the we&s;tern empire, con|tinued for &s;ome time to be of the &s;ame kind in their new &s;ettle|ments as it had been in their original country. It was a militia of &s;hepherds and hu&s;bandmen, which, in time of war, took the field under the command of the &s;ame chieftains whom it was accu&s;tomed to obey in peace. It was, therefore, tolerably well exerci&s;ed, and tolerably well di&s;ciplined. As arts and indu&s;try advanced, however, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great body of the people had le&s;s time to &s;pare for military exerci&s;es. Both the di&s;cipline and the exerci&s;e of the feudal militia, therefore, went gradually to ruin, and &s;tanding armies were gradually intro|duced to &s;upply the place of it. When the expedient of a &s;tand|ing army, be&s;ides, had once been adopted by one civilized nation, it became nece&s;&s;ary that all its neighbours &s;hould follow the example. They &s;oon found that their &s;afety depended upon their doing &s;o, and that their own militia was altogether incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the attack of &s;uch an army.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers of a &s;tanding army, though they may never have &s;een an enemy, yet have frequently appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the cou|rage of veteran troops, and the very moment that they took the field to have been fit to face the hardie&s;t and mo&s;t experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Ru&s;&s;ian army marched into Poland, the valour of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers did not appear inferior to that of the Pru&s;|&s;ians, at that time &s;uppo&s;ed to be the hardie&s;t and mo&s;t experienced veterans in Europe. The Ru&s;&s;ian empire, however, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and could at that time have very few &s;oldiers who had ever &s;een an enemy. When
<PB N="310" REF="312">
the Spani&s;h war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a pro|found peace for about eight and twenty years. The valour of her &s;oldiers, however, far from being corrupted by that long peace, was never more di&s;tingui&s;hed than in the attempt upon Carthagena, the fir&s;t unfortunate exploit of that unfortunate war. In a long peace the generals, perhaps, may &s;ometimes forget their &s;kill; but, where a well regulated &s;tanding army has been kept up, the &s;ol|diers &s;eem never to forget their valour.</P>
<P>WHEN a civilized nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at all times expo&s;ed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to be in its neighbourhood. The frequent con|que&s;ts of all the civilized countries in A&s;ia by the Tartars, &s;uffi|ciently demon&s;trate the natural &s;uperiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation. A well regulated &s;tanding army is &s;uperior to every militia. Such an army, as it can be&s;t be maintained by an opulent and civilized nation, &s;o it can alone defend &s;uch a nation again&s;t the inva&s;ion of a poor and barbarous neighbour. It is only by means of a &s;tanding army, therefore, that the civilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even pre&s;erved for any con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>As it is only by means of a well regulated &s;tanding army that a civilized country can be defended, &s;o it is only by means of it that a barbarous country can be &s;uddenly and tolerably civilized. A &s;tanding army e&s;tabli&s;hes, with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, the law of the &s;overeign through the remote&s;t provinces of the empire, and main|tains &s;ome degree of regular government in countries which could not otherwi&s;e admit of any. Whoever examines, with attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced into the Ru&s;|&s;ian empire, will find that they almo&s;t all re&s;olve them&s;elves into the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a well regulated &s;tanding army. It is the in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="311" REF="313">
which executes and maintains all his other regulations. That degree of order and internal peace which that empire has ever &s;ince enjoyed, is altogether owing to the influence of that army.</P>
<P>MEN of republican principles have been jealous of a &s;tanding army as dangerous to liberty. It certainly is &s;o wherever the intere&s;t of the general and that of the principal officers are not nece&s;&s;arily connected with the &s;upport of the con&s;titution of the &s;tate. The &s;tanding army of Ce&s;ar de&s;troyed the Roman repub|lick. The &s;tanding army of Cromwell turned the long parlia|ment out of doors. But where the &s;overeign is him&s;elf the general, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief officers of the army; where the military force is placed under the command of tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the &s;up|port of the civil authority, becau&s;e they have them&s;elves the greate&s;t &s;hare of that authority, a &s;tanding army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the contrary, it may in &s;ome ca&s;es be favourable to liberty. The &s;ecurity which it gives to the &s;overeign renders unnece&s;&s;ary that trouble&s;ome jealou&s;y which in &s;ome modern republicks &s;eems to watch over the minute&s;t actions, and to be at all times ready to di&s;turb the peace of every citizen. Where the &s;ecurity of the magi&s;trate, though &s;upported by the principal people of the country, is endangered by every popular di&s;content; where a &s;mall tumult is capable of bringing about in a few hours a great revolution, the whole authority of government mu&s;t be employed to &s;uppre&s;s and puni&s;h every murmur and complaint again&s;t it. To a &s;overeign, on the contrary, who feels him&s;elf &s;upported, not only by the natural ari&s;tocracy of the country, but by a well regulated &s;tanding army, the rude&s;t, the mo&s;t groundle&s;s, and the mo&s;t licentious remon&s;trances can give little di&s;turbance. He can &s;afely pardon or neglect them, and his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;uperiority naturally di&s;po&s;es him to do
<PB N="312" REF="314">
&s;o. That degree of liberty which approaches to licentiou&s;ne&s;s can be tolerated only in countries where the &s;overeign is &s;ecured by a well regulated &s;tanding army. It is in &s;uch countries only that the publick &s;afety does not require that the &s;overeign &s;hould be tru&s;ted with any di&s;cretionary power for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing even the impertinent wantonne&s;s of this licentious liberty.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t duty of the &s;overeign, therefore, that of defending the &s;ociety from the violence and inju&s;tice of other independent &s;ocieties, grows gradually more and more expen&s;ive as the &s;ociety advances in civilization. The military force of the &s;ociety, which originally co&s;t the &s;overeign no expence either in time of peace or in time of war, mu&s;t, in the progre&s;s of improvement, fir&s;t be maintained by him in time of war, and afterwards even in time of peace.</P>
<P>THE great change introduced into the art of war by the inven|tion of fire arms, has enhanced &s;till further both the expence of exerci&s;ing and di&s;ciplining any particular number of &s;oldiers in time of peace, and that of employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition are become more expen&s;ive. A mu&s;quet is a more expen&s;ive machine than a javelin or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar, than a bali&s;ta or a catapulta. The powder which is &s;pent in a modern review is lo&s;t irrecover|ably, and occa&s;ions a very con&s;iderable expence. The javelins and arrows which were thrown or &s;hot in an antient one, could ea&s;ily be picked up again, and were be&s;ides of very little value. The cannon and the mortar are, not only much dearer, but much heavier machines than the bali&s;ta or catapulta, and require a greater expence not only to prepare them for the field, but to carry them to it. As the &s;uperiority of the modern artillery too over that of the antients is very great; it has become much more
<PB N="313" REF="315">
difficult, and con&s;equently much more expen&s;ive, to fortify a rown &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t even for a few weeks the attack of that &s;upe|tior artillery. In modern times many different cau&s;es contribute to render the defence of the &s;ociety more expen&s;ive. The unavoid|able effects of the natural progre&s;s of improvement have, in this re&s;pect, been a good deal enhanced by a great revolution in the art of war, to which a mere accident, the invention of gunpowder, &s;eems to have given occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN modern war the great expence of fire-arms gives an evident advantage to the nation which can be&s;t afford that expence; and con&s;equently to an opulent and civilized over a poor and barbarous nation. In antient times the opulent and civilized found it diffi|cult to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the poor and barbarous nations. In modern times the poor and barbarous find it difficult to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the opulent and civilized. The invention of fire-arms, an invention which at fir&s;t &s;ight appears to be &s;o perni|cious, is certainly favourable both to the permanency and to the exten&s;ion of civilization.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. <HI>Of the Expence of Ju&s;tice</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd duty of the &s;overeign, that of protecting, as far as po&s;&s;ible, every member of the &s;ociety from the inju&s;tice or oppre&s;&s;ion of every other member of it, or the duty of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing an exact admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, requires too very different degrees of expence in the different periods of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>AMONG nations of hunters, as there is &s;carce any property, or at lea&s;t none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour; &s;o there is &s;eldom any e&s;tabli&s;hed magi&s;trate or any regular admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Men who have no property can injure one
<PB N="314" REF="316">
another only in their per&s;ons or reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames another, though he to whom the injury is done &s;uffers, he who does it receives no benefit. It is otherwi&s;e with the injuries to property. The benefit of the per&s;on who does the injury is often equal to the lo&s;s of him who &s;uffers it. Envy, malice, or re&s;entment, are the only pa&s;&s;ions which can prompt one man to injure another in his per&s;on or reputation. But the greater part of men are not very frequently under the influence of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; and the very wor&s;t men are &s;o only occa&s;ionally. As their gratification too, how agreeable &s;oever it may be to certain characters, is not attended with any real or permanent advantage, it is in the greater part of men commonly re&s;trained by prudential con&s;iderations. Men may live together in &s;ociety with &s;ome tolerable degree of &s;ecurity, though there is no civil magi&s;trate to protect them from the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of pre&s;ent ea&s;e and enjoyment, are the pa&s;&s;ions which prompt to invade property, pa&s;&s;ions much more &s;teady in their operation, and much more univer&s;al in their influence. Wherever there is great property, there is great ine|quality. For one very rich man, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few &s;uppo&s;es the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy to invade his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It is only under the &s;helter of the civil magi&s;trate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, can &s;leep a &s;ingle night in &s;ecurity. He is at all times &s;urrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appea&s;e, and from who&s;e inju&s;tice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magi&s;trate continually held up to cha&s;ti&s;e it. The acqui|&s;ition
<PB N="315" REF="317">
of valuable or exten&s;ive property, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily requires the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at lea&s;t none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour, civil government is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>CIVIL government &s;uppo&s;es a certain &s;ubordination. But as the nece&s;&s;ity of civil government gradually grows up with the acqui&s;i|tion of valuable property, &s;o the principal cau&s;es which naturally introduce &s;ubordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es or circum&s;tances which naturally introduce &s;ubordi|nation, or which naturally, and antecedent to any civil in&s;titution, give &s;ome men &s;ome &s;uperiority over the greater part of their brethren, &s;eem to be four in number.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of tho&s;e cau&s;es or circum&s;tances is the &s;uperiority of per&s;onal qualifications, of &s;trength, beauty, and agility of body; of wi&s;dom, and virtue, of prudence, ju&s;tice, fortitude, and mo|deration of mind. The qualifications of the body, unle&s;s &s;up|ported by tho&s;e of the mind, can give little authority in any period of &s;ociety. He is a very &s;trong man who by mere &s;trength of body can force two weak ones to obey him. The qualifica|tions of the mind can alone give very great authority. They are, however, invi&s;ible qualities; always di&s;putable, and generally di&s;puted. No &s;ociety, whether barbarous or civilized, has ever found it convenient to &s;ettle the rules of precedency, of rank and &s;ubordination, according to tho&s;e invi&s;ible qualities; but according to &s;omething that is more plain and palpable.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd of tho&s;e cau&s;es or circum&s;tances is the &s;uperiority of age. An old man, provided his age is not &s;o far advanced as to give &s;u&s;picion of dotage, is every where more re&s;pected than a
<PB N="316" REF="318">
young man of equal rank, fortune, and abilities. Among nations of hunters, &s;uch as the native tribes of North America, age is the &s;ole foundation of rank and precedency. Among them, father is the appellation of a &s;uperior; brother, of an equal; and &s;on, of an inferior. In the mo&s;t opulent and civilized nations, age regulates rank among tho&s;e who are in every other re&s;pect equal, and among whom therefore there is nothing el&s;e to regulate it. Among brothers and among &s;i&s;ters, the elde&s;t always take place; and in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the paternal e&s;tate every thing which cannot be divided, but mu&s;t go entire to one per&s;on, &s;uch as a title of honour, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es given to the elde&s;t. Age is a plain and palpable quality which admits of no di&s;pute.</P>
<P>THE third of tho&s;e cau&s;es or circum&s;tances is the &s;uperiority of fortune. The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of &s;ociety, is perhaps greate&s;t in the rude&s;t age of &s;ociety which admits of any con&s;iderable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increa&s;e of who&s;e herds and flocks is &s;ufficient to main|tain a thou&s;and men, cannot well employ that increa&s;e in any other way than in maintaining a thou&s;and men. The rude &s;tate of his &s;ociety does not afford him any manufactured produce, any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own con|&s;umption. The thou&s;and men whom he thus maintains, de|pending entirely upon him for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t both obey his orders in war, and &s;ubmit to his juri&s;diction in peace. He is nece&s;&s;arily both their general and their judge, and his chieftain&s;hip is the nece&s;&s;ary effect of the &s;uperiority of his fortune. In an opulent and civilized &s;ociety, a man may po&s;&s;e&s;s a much greater fortune, and yet not be able to command a dozen of people. Though the produce of his e&s;tate may be &s;ufficient to maintain, and may perhaps actually maintain, more than a thou&s;and people,
<PB N="317" REF="319">
yet as tho&s;e people pay for every thing which they get from him, as he gives &s;carce any thing to any body but in exchange for an equivalent, there is &s;carce any body who con&s;iders him&s;elf as en|tirely dependent upon him, and his authority extends only over a few menial &s;ervants. The authority of fortune, however, is very great even in an opulent and civilized &s;ociety. That it is much greater than that either of age or of per&s;onal qualities, has been the con&s;tant complaint of every period of &s;ociety which admitted of any con&s;iderable inequality of fortune. The fir&s;t period of &s;ociety, that of hunters, admits of no &s;uch inequality. Univer&s;al poverty e&s;tabli&s;hes there univer&s;al equality, and the &s;uperiority either of age or of per&s;onal qualities are the feeble, but the &s;ole foundations of authority and &s;ubordination. There is there|fore little or no authority or &s;ubordination in this period of &s;ociety. The &s;econd period of &s;ociety, that of &s;hepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and there is no period in which the &s;uperiority of fortune gives &s;o great authority to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. There is no period accordingly in which authority and &s;ubordination are more perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The authority of an Arabian &s;cherif is very great; that of a Tartar khan alto|gether de&s;potical.</P>
<P>THE fourth of tho&s;e cau&s;es or circum&s;tances is the &s;uperiority of birth. Superiority of birth &s;uppo&s;es an antient &s;uperiority of fortune in the family of the per&s;on who claims it. All families are equally antient; and the ance&s;tors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well be more numerous than tho&s;e of the beggar. Antiquity of family means every where the anti|quity either of wealth, or of that greatne&s;s which is commonly either founded upon wealth or accompanied with it. Up&s;tart greatne&s;s is every where le&s;s re&s;pected than antient greatne&s;s. The hatred of u&s;urpers, the love for the family of an antient monarch,
<PB N="318" REF="320">
are in a great mea&s;ure founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the former, and upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer &s;ubmits without reluctance to the authority of a &s;uperior by whom he has always been commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior &s;hould be &s;et over his head; &s;o men ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to a family to whom they and their ance&s;tors have always &s;ubmitted, but are fired with indignation when another family, in whom they had never acknowledged any &s;uch &s;uperiority, a&s;&s;umes a dominion over them.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction of birth, being &s;ub&s;equent to the inequality of fortune, can have no place in nations of hunters, among whom all men, being equal in fortune, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be very nearly equal in birth. The &s;on of a wi&s;e and brave man may, indeed, even among them, be &s;omewhat more re&s;pected than a man of equal merit who has the misfortune to be the &s;on of a fool or a coward. The difference, however, will not be very great; and there never was, I believe, a great family in the world who&s;e illu&s;tration was intirely derived from the inheritance of wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction of birth not only may, but always does take place among nations of &s;hepherds. Such nations are always &s;trangers to every &s;ort of luxury, and great wealth can &s;carce ever be di&s;&s;ipated among them by improvident profu&s;ion. There are no nations accordingly who abound more in families revered and honoured on account of their de&s;cent from a long race of great and illu&s;trious ance&s;tors; becau&s;e there are no nations among whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the &s;ame families.</P>
<P>BIRTH and fortune are evidently the two circum&s;tances which principally &s;et one man above another. They are the two great &s;ources
<PB N="319" REF="321">
of per&s;onal di&s;tinction, and are therefore the principal cau&s;es which naturally e&s;tabli&s;h authority and &s;ubordination among men. Among nations of &s;hepherds both tho&s;e cau&s;es operate with their full force. The great &s;hepherd or herd&s;man, re&s;pected on account of his great wealth, and of the great number of tho&s;e who depend upon him for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and revered on account of the noblene&s;s of his birth, and of the immemorial antiquity of his illu&s;trious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior &s;hepherds or herd&s;men of his horde or clan. He can command the united force of a greater number of people than any of them. His military power is greater than that of any of them. In time of war they are all of them naturally di&s;po&s;ed to mu&s;ter them&s;elves under his banner, rather than under that of any other per&s;on, and his birth and fortune thus naturally procure to him &s;ome &s;ort of executive power. By com|manding too the united force of a greater number of people than any of them, he is be&s;t able to compel any one of them who may have injured another to compen&s;ate the wrong. He is the per&s;on, therefore, to whom all tho&s;e who are too weak to defend them&s;elves naturally look up for protection. It is to him that they naturally complain of the injuries which they imagine have been done to them, and his interpo&s;ition in &s;uch ca&s;es is more ea&s;ily &s;ubmitted to, even by the per&s;on complained of, than that of any other per&s;on would be. His birth and fortune thus naturally procure him &s;ome &s;ort of judicial authority.</P>
<P>IT is in the age of &s;hepherds, in the &s;econd period of &s;ociety, that the inequality of fortune fir&s;t begins to take place, and intro|duces among men a degree of authority and &s;ubordination which could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t before. It thereby introduces &s;ome degree of that civil government which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for its own pre&s;ervation: and it &s;eems to do this naturally, and even independent of the con&s;ideration of that nece&s;&s;ity. The con&s;ideration of that
<PB N="320" REF="322">
nece&s;&s;ity comes no doubt afterwards to contribute very much to maintain and &s;ecure that authority and &s;ubordination. The rich, in particular, are nece&s;&s;arily intere&s;ted to &s;upport that order of things which can alone &s;ecure them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own advantages. Men of inferior wealth combine to defend tho&s;e of &s;uperior wealth in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their property, in order that men of &s;uperior wealth may combine to defend them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of theirs. All the inferior &s;hepherds and herd&s;men feel that the &s;ecurity of their own herds and flocks depends upon the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e of the great &s;hepherd or herd&s;man; that the maintenance of their le&s;&s;er autho|rity depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their &s;ubordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in &s;ubordination to them. They con&s;titute a &s;ort of little nobility, who feel them&s;elves intere&s;ted to defend the property and to &s;upport the authority of their own little &s;overeign, in order that he may be able to defend their property and to &s;upport their authority. Civil government, &s;o far as it is in&s;tituted for the &s;ecurity of property, is in reality in&s;tituted for the defence of the rich again&s;t the poor, or of tho&s;e who have &s;ome property again&s;t tho&s;e who have none at all.</P>
<P>THE judicial authority of &s;uch a &s;overeign, however, far from being a cau&s;e of expence, was for a long time a &s;ource of revenue to him. The per&s;ons who applied to him for ju&s;tice were always willing to pay for it, and a pre&s;ent never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority of the &s;overeign too was thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the per&s;on found guilty, over and above the &s;atisfaction which he was obliged to make to the party, was likewi&s;e forced to pay an amercement to the &s;overeign. He had given trouble, he had di&s;turbed, he had broke the peace of his lord the king, and for tho&s;e offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar govern|ments
<PB N="321" REF="323">
of A&s;ia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by the German and Scythian nations who overturned the Roman empire, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was a con&s;iderable &s;ource of revenue both to the &s;overeign and to all the le&s;&s;er chiefs or lords who exerci&s;ed under him any particular juri&s;diction, either over &s;ome particular tribe or clan, or over &s;ome particular territory or di&s;trict. Originally both the &s;overeign and the inferior chiefs u&s;ed to exerci&s;e this juri&s;diction in their own per&s;ons. After|wards they univer&s;ally found it convenient to delegate it to &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute, bailiff, or judge. This &s;ub&s;titute, however, was &s;till obliged to account to his principal or con&s;tituent for the profits of the juri&s;diction. Whoever reads the in&s;tructions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are to be found in Tyrrell's Hi&s;tory of England.</NOTE> which were given to the judges of the circuit in the time of Henry II. will &s;ee clearly that tho&s;e judges were a &s;ort of itinerant factors, &s;ent round the country for the purpo&s;e of levying certain branches of the king's revenue. In tho&s;e days the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice not only afforded a certain revenue to the &s;overeign, but to procure this reve|nue &s;eems to have been one of the principal advantages which he propo&s;ed to obtain by the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme of making the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of revenue, could &s;carce fail to be productive of &s;everal very gro&s;s abu&s;es. The per&s;on who applied for ju&s;tice with a large pre&s;ent in his hand was likely to get &s;omething more than ju&s;tice; while he who applied for it with a &s;mall one was likely to get &s;ome|thing le&s;s. Ju&s;tice too might frequently be delayed, in order that this pre&s;ent might be repeated. The amercement, be&s;ides, of the per&s;on complained of, might frequently &s;ugge&s;t a very &s;trong rea&s;on for finding him in the wrong, even when he had not really been &s;o. That &s;uch abu&s;es were far from being uncommon, the antient hi&s;tory of every country in Europe bears witne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="324">
WHEN the &s;overeign or chief exerci&s;ed his judicial authority in his own per&s;on, how much &s;oever he might abu&s;e it, it mu&s;t have been &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to get any redre&s;s; becau&s;e there could &s;eldom be any body powerful enough to call him to account. When he exerci&s;ed it by a bailiff, indeed, redre&s;s might &s;ometimes be had. If it was for his own benefit only that the bailiff had been guilty of any act of inju&s;tice, the &s;overeign him&s;elf might not always be unwilling to puni&s;h him, or to oblige him to repair the wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his &s;overeign, if it was in order to make court to the per&s;on who appointed him and who might prefer him, that he had committed any act of oppre&s;&s;ion, redre&s;s would upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions be as impo&s;&s;ible as if the &s;overeign had committed it him&s;elf. In all bar|barous governments, accordingly, in all tho&s;e antient governments of Europe in particular, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt; far from being quite equal and impartial even under the be&s;t monarchs, and altogether profligate under the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>AMONG nations of &s;hepherds, where the &s;overeign or chief is only the greate&s;t &s;hepherd or herd&s;man of the horde or clan, he is maintained in the &s;ame manner as any of his va&s;&s;als or &s;ubjects, by the increa&s;e of his own herds or flocks. Among tho&s;e nations of hu&s;bandmen who are but ju&s;t come out of the &s;hepherd &s;tate, and who are not much advanced beyond that &s;tate; &s;uch as the Greek tribes appear to have been about the time of the Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ance&s;tors when they fir&s;t &s;ettled upon the ruins of the we&s;tern empire; the &s;overeign or chief is in the &s;ame manner only the greate&s;t landlord of the country, and is maintained, in the &s;ame manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived from his own private e&s;tate, or from what in modern Europe was called the deme&s;ne of the crown. His &s;ubjects upon ordinary occa&s;ions contribute nothing to
<PB N="323" REF="325">
his &s;upport, except when they &s;tand in need of the interpo&s;ition of his authority in order to protect them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of their fellow &s;ubjects. The pre&s;ents which they make him upon &s;uch occa&s;ions con&s;titute the whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except perhaps upon &s;ome very extra|ordinary emergencies, he derives from his dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles for his friend|&s;hip the &s;overeignty of &s;even Greek cities, the &s;ole advantage which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was, that the peo|ple would honour him with pre&s;ents. As long as &s;uch pre&s;ents, as long as the emoluments of ju&s;tice, or what may be called the fees of court, con&s;tituted in this manner the whole ordinary revenue which the &s;overeign derived from his &s;overeignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even decently be propo&s;ed that he &s;hould give them up altogether. It might, and it frequently was propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould regulate and a&s;certain them. But after they had been &s;o regulated and a&s;certained, how to hinder a per&s;on who was all-powerful from extending them beyond tho&s;e regulations, was &s;till very difficult, not to &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible. During the continuance of this &s;tate of things, therefore, the corruption of ju&s;tice, naturally re&s;ulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of tho&s;e pre&s;ents, &s;carce admitted of any effectual remedy.</P>
<P>BUT when from different cau&s;es, chiefly from the continually increa&s;ing expence of defending the nation again&s;t the inva&s;ion of other nations, the private e&s;tate of the &s;overeign had become alto|gether in&s;ufficient for defraying the expence of the &s;overeignty; and when it had become nece&s;&s;ary that the people &s;hould, for their own &s;ecurity, contribute towards this expence by taxes of different kinds, it &s;eems to have been very commonly &s;tipulated that no pre&s;ent for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice &s;hould, under any pre|tence, be accepted either by the &s;overeign, or by his bailiffs and &s;ub|&s;titutes,
<PB N="324" REF="326">
the judges. Tho&s;e pre&s;ents, it &s;eems to have been &s;up|po&s;ed, could more ea&s;ily be aboli&s;hed altogether, than effectually regulated and a&s;certained. Fixed &s;alaries were appointed to the judges, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to compen&s;ate to them the lo&s;s of whatever might have been their &s;hare of the antient emoluments of ju&s;tice; as the taxes more than compen&s;ated to the &s;overeign the lo&s;s of his. Ju&s;tice was then &s;aid to be admini&s;tered gratis.</P>
<P>JUSTICE, however, never was in reality admini&s;tered gratis in any country. Lawyers and attornies, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t always be paid by the parties; and, if they were not, they would perform their duty &s;till wor&s;e than they actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attornies amount, in every court, to a much greater &s;um than the &s;alaries of the judges. The circum&s;tance of tho&s;e &s;alaries being paid by the crown, can no where much dimi|ni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary expence of a law-&s;uit. But it was not &s;o much to dimini&s;h the expence, as to prevent the corruption of ju&s;tice, that the judges were prohibited from receiving any pre&s;ent or fee from the parties.</P>
<P>THE office of judge is in it&s;elf &s;o very honourable, that men are willing to accept of it, though accompanied with very &s;mall emolu|ments. The inferior office of ju&s;tice of peace, though attended with a good deal of trouble, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es with no emoluments at all, is an object of ambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen. The &s;alaries of all the different judges, high and low, together with the whole expence of the admini&s;tration and execu|tion of ju&s;tice, even where it is not managed with very good oeconomy, makes, in any civilized country, but a very incon&s;ider|able part of the whole expence of government.</P>
<P>THE whole expence of ju&s;tice too might ea&s;ily be defrayed by the fees of court; and, without expo&s;ing the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice
<PB N="325" REF="327">
to any real hazard of corruption, the public revenue might thus be entirely di&s;charged from a certain, though, perhaps, but a &s;mall incumbrance. It is difficult to regulate the fees of court effectu|ally, where a per&s;on &s;o powerful as the &s;overeign is to &s;hare in them, and to derive any con&s;iderable part of his revenue from them. It is very ea&s;y, where the judge is the principal per&s;on who can reap any benefit from them. The law can very ea&s;ily oblige the judge to re&s;pect the regulation, though it might not always be able to make the &s;overeign re&s;pect it. Where the fees of court are preci&s;ely regulated and a&s;certained, where they are paid all at once, at a certain period of every proce&s;s, into the hands of a ca&s;hier or receiver, to be by him di&s;tributed in certain known pro|portions among the different judges after the proce&s;s is decided, and not till it is decided, there &s;eems to be no more danger of cor|ruption than where &s;uch fees are prohibited altogether. Tho&s;e fees, without occa&s;ioning any con&s;iderable increa&s;e in the expence of a law-&s;uit, might be rendered fully &s;ufficient for defraying the whole expence of ju&s;tice. By not being paid to the judges till the proce&s;s was determined, they might be &s;ome incitement to the dili|gence of the court in examining and deciding it. In courts which con&s;i&s;ted of a con&s;iderable number of judges, by proportioning the &s;hare of each judge to the number of hours and days which he had employed in examining the proce&s;s, either in the court or in a committee by order of the court, tho&s;e fees might give &s;ome encouragement to the diligence of each particular judge. Public &s;ervices are never better performed than when their reward comes only in con&s;equence of their being performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them. In the different par|liaments of France, the fees of court (called Epices and vacations) con&s;titute the far greater part of the emoluments of the judges. After all deductions are made, the neat &s;alary paid by the crown to a coun|&s;ellor or judge in the parliament of Toulou&s;e, in rank and dignity the
<PB N="326" REF="328">
&s;econd parliament of the kingdom, amounts only to a hundred and fifty livres, about &s;ix pounds eleven &s;hillings &s;terling a year. About &s;even years ago that &s;um was in the &s;ame place the ordinary yearly wages of a common footman. The di&s;tribution of tho&s;e Epices too is according to the diligence of the judges. A diligent judge gains a comfortable, though moderate revenue by his office: An idle one gets little more than his &s;alary. Tho&s;e parliaments are perhaps, in many re&s;pects, not very convenient courts of ju&s;tice; but they have never been accu&s;ed; they &s;eem never even to have been &s;u&s;pected of corruption.</P>
<P>THE fees of court &s;eem originally to have been the principal &s;up|port of the different courts of ju&s;tice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw to it&s;elf as much bu&s;ine&s;s as it could, and was, upon that account, willing to take cognizance of many &s;uits which were not originally intended to fall under its juri&s;diction. The court of king's bench, in&s;tituted for the trial of criminal cau&s;es only, took cognizance of civil &s;uits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him ju&s;tice, had been guilty of &s;ome tre&s;pa&s;s or mi&s;demeanor. The court of exchequer, in&s;tituted for the levying of the king's revenue, and for enforcing the payment of &s;uch debts only as were due to the king, took cognizance of all other contract debts; the plaintiff alledging that he could not pay the king, be|cau&s;e the defendant would not pay him. In con&s;equence of &s;uch fictions it came, in many ca&s;es, to depend altogether upon the par|ties before what court they would chu&s;e to have their cau&s;e tried; and each court endeavoured, by &s;uperior di&s;patch and impartiality, to draw to it&s;elf as many cau&s;es as it could. The pre&s;ent admi|rable con&s;titution of the courts of ju&s;tice in England was, perhaps, originally in a great mea&s;ure formed by this emulation which antiently took place between their re&s;pective judges; each judge endeavouring to give, in his own court, the &s;peedie&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="327" REF="329">
effectual remedy, which the law would admit, for every &s;ort of inju&s;tice. Originally the courts of law gave damages only for breach of contract. The court of chancery, as a court of con|&s;cience, fir&s;t took upon it to enforce the &s;pecific performance of agreements. When the breach of contract con&s;i&s;ted in the non|payment of money, the damage &s;u&s;tained could be compen&s;ated in no other way than by ordering payment, which was equivalent to a &s;pecific performance of the agreement. In &s;uch ca&s;es, there|fore, the remedy of the courts of law was &s;ufficient. It was not &s;o in others. When the tenant &s;ued his lord for having unju&s;tly outed him of his lea&s;e, the damages which he recovered were by no means equivalent to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land. Such cau&s;es, therefore, for &s;ome time, went all to the court of chancery, to the no &s;mall lo&s;s of the courts of law. It was to draw back &s;uch cau&s;es to them&s;elves that the courts of law are &s;aid to have invented the artificial and fictitious writ of ejectment, the mo&s;t effectual remedy for an unju&s;t outer or di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land.</P>
<P>A STAMP-DUTY upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be levied by that court, and applied towards the mainte|nance of the judges and other officers belonging to it, might, in the &s;ame manner, afford a revenue &s;ufficient for defraying the expence of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, without bringing any bur|den upon the general revenue of the &s;ociety. The judges indeed might, in this ca&s;e, be under the temptation of multiplying unne|ce&s;&s;arily the proceedings upon every cau&s;e, in order to increa&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the produce of &s;uch a &s;tamp-duty. It has been the cu&s;tom in modern Europe to regulate, upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions, the payment of the attornies and clerks of court according to the number of pages which they had occa&s;ion to write; the court, however, requiring that each page &s;hould contain &s;o many lines, and each line &s;o many words. In order to increa&s;e their payment,
<PB N="328" REF="330">
the attornies and clerks have contrived to multiply words beyond all nece&s;&s;ity, to the corruption of the law language of, I believe, every court of ju&s;tice in Europe. A like temptation might per|haps occa&s;ion a like corruption in the form of law proceedings.</P>
<P>BUT whether the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice be &s;o contrived as to defray its own expence, or whether the judges be maintained by fixed &s;alaries paid to them from &s;ome other fund, it does not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary that the per&s;on or per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the executive power &s;hould be charged with the management of that fund, or with the payment of tho&s;e &s;alaries. That fund might ari&s;e from the rent of landed e&s;tates, the management of each e&s;tate being entru&s;ted to the particular court which was to be maintained by it. That fund might ari&s;e even from the intere&s;t of a &s;um of money, the lending out of which might, in the &s;ame manner, be entru&s;ted to the court which was to be maintained by it. A part, though indeed but a &s;mall part, of the &s;alary of the judges of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in Scotland, ari&s;es from the intere&s;t of a &s;um of money. The nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tability of &s;uch a fund &s;eems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of an in&s;titution which ought to la&s;t forever.</P>
<P>THE &s;eparation of the judicial from the executive power &s;eems originally to have ari&s;en from the increa&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety, in con&s;equence of its increa&s;ing improvement. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice became &s;o laborious and &s;o complicated a duty as to require the undivided attention of the per&s;ons to whom it was entru&s;ted. The per&s;on entru&s;ted with the executive power not having lei&s;ure to attend to the deci&s;ion of private cau&s;es him&s;elf, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his &s;tead. In the progre&s;s of the Roman greatne&s;s, the con&s;ul was too much occupied with the poli|tical affairs of the &s;tate to attend to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.
<PB N="329" REF="331">
A praetor, therefore, was appointed to admini&s;ter it in his &s;tead. In the progre&s;s of the European monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the &s;overeigns and the great lords came univer&s;ally to con&s;ider the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice as an office both too laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own per&s;ons. They univer&s;ally, therefore, di&s;charged them&s;elves of it by appointing a deputy, bailiff, or judge.</P>
<P>WHEN the judicial is united to the executive power, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible that ju&s;tice &s;hould not frequently be &s;acrificed to, what is vulgarly called, politics. The per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the great intere&s;ts of the &s;tate may, even without any corrupt views, &s;ometimes imagine it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice to tho&s;e intere&s;ts the rights of a pri|vate man. But upon the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice depends the liberty of every individual, the &s;en&s;e which he has of his own &s;ecurity. In order to make every individual feel him&s;elf perfectly &s;ecure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every right which belongs to him, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that the judicial &s;hould be &s;eparated from the executive power, but that it &s;hould be rendered as much as po&s;&s;ible independent of that power. The judge &s;hould not be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of that power. The regular payment of his &s;alary &s;hould not depend upon the good|will, or even upon the good oeconomy of that power.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. <HI>Of the Expence of publick Works and publick In&s;titutions.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE third and la&s;t duty of the &s;overeign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining tho&s;e publick in&s;titutions and tho&s;e publick works, which, though they may be in the highe&s;t degree advantageous to a great &s;ociety, are, however, of &s;uch a
<PB N="330" REF="332">
nature, that the profit could never repay the expence to any indivi|dual or &s;mall number of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or &s;mall number of individuals &s;hould erect or maintain. The performance of this duty requires too very different degrees of expence in the different periods of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>AFTER the publick in&s;titutions and publick works nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the &s;ociety, and for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, both of which have already been mentioned, the other works and in&s;ti|tutions of this kind are chiefly tho&s;e for facilitating the commerce of the &s;ociety, and tho&s;e for promoting the in&s;truction of the people. The in&s;titutions for in&s;truction are of two kinds; tho&s;e for the education of the youth, and tho&s;e for the in&s;truction of people of all ages. The con&s;ideration of the manner in which the expence of tho&s;e different &s;orts of publick work and in&s;titutions may be mo&s;t properly defrayed, will divide this third part of the pre&s;ent chapter into three different articles.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the publick Works and In&s;titutions for facilitating the Commerce of the Society.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the erection and maintenance of the publick works which facilitate the commerce of any country, &s;uch as good roads, bridges, navigable canals, harbours, &amp;c. mu&s;t require very different degrees of expence in the different periods of &s;ociety, is evident without any proof. The expence of making and maintaining the publick roads of any country mu&s;t evidently increa&s;e with the annual produce of the land and labour of that country, or with the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to fetch and carry upon tho&s;e roads. The &s;trength of a bridge mu&s;t be &s;uited to the number and weight of the carriages which are likely to pa&s;s over it. The depth and the &s;upply of water for a navigable canal mu&s;t be proportioned to the number and tunnage of the lighters which are likely to carry
<PB N="331" REF="333">
goods upon it; the extent of a harbour to the number of the &s;hip|ping which are likely to take &s;helter in it.</P>
<P>IT does not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary that the expence of tho&s;e publick works &s;hould be defrayed from that publick revenue, as it is com|monly called, of which the collection and application is in mo&s;t countries a&s;&s;igned to the executive power. The greater part of &s;uch publick works may ea&s;ily be &s;o managed as to afford a parti|cular revenue &s;ufficient for defraying their own expence, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A HIGHWAY, a bridge, a navigable canal, for example, may in mo&s;t ca&s;es be both made and maintained by a &s;mall toll upon the carriages which make u&s;e of them: a harbour, by a moderate port duty upon the tunnage of the &s;hipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another in&s;titution for facilitating commerce, in many countries, not only defrays its own expence, but affords a &s;mall revenue or &s;eignorage to the &s;overeign. The po&s;t office, an|other in&s;titution for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, over and above defraying its own expence, affords in almo&s;t all countries a very con&s;iderable revenue to the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>WHEN the carriages which pa&s;s over a highway or a bridge, and the lighters which &s;ail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their weight or their tunnage, they pay for the maintenance of tho&s;e publick works exactly in proportion to the tear and wear which they occa&s;ion of them. It &s;eems &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining &s;uch works. This tax or toll too, though it is advanced by the carrier, is finally paid by the con&s;umer, to whom it mu&s;t always be charged in the price of the goods. As the expence of carriage, however, is very much reduced by means of &s;uch publick works, the goods, notwith&s;tanding the toll, come cheaper

to the con&s;umer than they could otherwi&s;e have done; their price not being &s;o much rai&s;ed by the toll, as it is lowered by the cheapne&s;s of the carriage. The per&s;on who finally pays this tax, therefore, gains, by the application, more than he lo&s;es by the payment of it. His payment is exactly in proportion to his gain.

<P>WHEN the toll upon carriages of luxury, upon coaches, po&s;t|chai&s;es, &amp;c. is made &s;omewhat higher in proportion to their weight, than upon carriages of nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e, &s;uch as carts, waggons, &amp;c. the indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute in a very ea&s;y manner to the relief of the poor, by rendering cheaper the tran&s;|portation of heavy goods to all the different parts of the country.</P>
<P>WHEN high roads, bridges, canals, &amp;c. are in this manner made and &s;upported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they can be made only where that commerce requires them, and con&s;equently where it is proper to make them. Their expence too, their grandeur and magnificence mu&s;t be &s;uited to what that commerce can afford to pay. They mu&s;t be made con|&s;equently as it is proper to make them. A magnificent high road cannot be made through a de&s;art country where there is little or no commerce, or merely becau&s;e it happens to lead to the country villa of the intendant of the province, or to that of &s;ome great lord to whom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody pa&s;&s;es, or merely to embelli&s;h the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace: things which &s;ometimes happen in countries where works of this kind are carried on by any other revenue than that which they them&s;elves are capable of affording.</P>

IN &s;everal different parts of Europe the toll or lock-duty upon a canal is the property of private per&s;ons, who&s;e private intere&s;t obliges them to keep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;es altogether, and along with it the whole profit which they can make by the tolls. If tho&s;e tolls were put under the management of commi&s;&s;ioners, who had them|&s;elves no intere&s;t in them, they might be le&s;s attentive to the main|tenance of the works which produced them. The canal of Languedoc co&s;t the king of France and the province upwards of thirteen millions of livres, which (at twenty-eight livres the mark of &s;ilver, the value of French money in the end of the la&s;t century) amounted to upwards of nine hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. When that great work was fini&s;hed, the mo&s;t likely method, it was found, of keeping it in con&s;tant repair was to make a pre&s;ent of the tolls to Riquet the engineer, who planned and conducted the work. Tho&s;e tolls con&s;titute at pre&s;ent a very large e&s;tate to the different branches of the family of that gentleman, who have therefore a great intere&s;t to keep the work in con&s;tant repair. But had tho&s;e tolls been put under the management of commi&s;&s;ioners who had no &s;uch intere&s;t, they might perhaps have been di&s;&s;ipated in ornamental and unnece&s;|&s;ary expences, while the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the work were allowed to go to ruin.</P>
<P>THE tolls for the maintenance of a high road, cannot with any &s;afety be made the property of private per&s;ons. A high road, though entirely neglected, does not become altogether impa&s;&s;able, though a canal does. The proprietors of the tolls upon a high road, therefore, might neglect altogether the repair of the road, and yet continue to levy very nearly the &s;ame tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the maintenance of &s;uch a work &s;hould be put under the management of commi&s;&s;ioners or tru&s;tees.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="336">
IN Great Britain, the abu&s;es which the tru&s;tees have committed in the management of tho&s;e tolls, have in many ca&s;es been very ju&s;tly complained of. At many turnpikes, it has been &s;aid, the money levied is more than double of what is nece&s;&s;ary for execut|ing in the compleate&s;t manner the work which is often executed in a very &s;lovenly manner, and &s;ometimes not executed at all. The &s;y&s;tem of repairing the high roads by tolls of this kind, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, is not of very long &s;tanding. We &s;hould not wonder, therefore, if it has not yet been brought to that degree of perfection of which it &s;eems to be capable. If mean and improper per&s;ons are frequently appointed tru&s;tees; and if proper courts of in&s;pection and account have not yet been e&s;tabli&s;hed for controuling their conduct, and for reducing the tolls to what is barely &s;ufficient for executing the work to be done by them; the recency of the in&s;titution both accounts and apo|logizes for tho&s;e defects, of which, by the wi&s;dom of parliament, the greater part may in due time be gradually remedied.</P>
<P>THE money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain is &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed &s;o much what is nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the roads, that the &s;avings, which with proper oeconomy might be made from it, have been con&s;idered, even by &s;ome mini&s;ters, as a very great re&s;ource which might at &s;ome time or another be applied to the exigencies of the &s;tate. Government, it has been &s;aid, by taking the management of the turnpikes into its own hands, and by employing the &s;oldiers, who would work for a very &s;mall addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order at a much le&s;s expence than it can be done by tru&s;tees who have no other workmen to employ, but &s;uch as derive their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from their wages. A great revenue, half a million perhaps, it has been pretended, might in this manner be gained without laying any new burden upon the people; and the turn|pike
<PB N="335" REF="337">
roads might be made to contribute to the general expence of the &s;tate, in the &s;ame manner as the po&s;t-office does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THAT a con&s;iderable revenue might be gained in this manner, I have no doubt, though probably not near &s;o much, as the pro|jectors of this plan have &s;uppo&s;ed. The plan it&s;elf, however, &s;eems liable to &s;everal very important objections.</P>
<P>FIRST, if the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes &s;hould ever be con&s;idered as one of the re&s;ources for &s;upplying the exi|gencies of the &s;tate, they would certainly be augmented as tho&s;e exigencies were &s;uppo&s;ed to require. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they would probably be augmented very fa&s;t. The facility with which a great revenue could be drawn from them, would probably encourage admini&s;tration to recur very frequently to this re&s;ource. Though it may perhaps be more than doubtful whether half a million could by any oeconomy be &s;aved out of the pre&s;ent tolls, it can &s;carce be doubted but that a million might be &s;aved out of them if they were doubled, and perhaps two millions if they were tripled. This great revenue too might be levied without the appointment of a &s;ingle new officer to collect and receive it. But the turnpike tolls being con|tinually augmented in this manner, in&s;tead of facilitating the inland commerce of the country, as at pre&s;ent, would &s;oon be|come a very great encumbrance upon it. The expence of tran&s;|porting all heavy goods from one part of the country to another would &s;oon be &s;o much increa&s;ed, the market for all &s;uch goods con&s;equently would &s;oon be &s;o much narrowed, that their pro|duction would be in a great mea&s;ure di&s;couraged, and the mo&s;t important branches of the dome&s;tic indu&s;try of the country anni|hilated altogether.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="338">
SECONDLY, a tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight, though a very equal tax when applied to the &s;ole purpo&s;e of re|pairing the roads, is a very unequal one, when applied to any other purpo&s;e, or to &s;upply the common exigencies of the &s;tate. When it is applied to the &s;ole purpo&s;e above mentioned, each carriage is &s;uppo&s;ed to pay exactly for the tear and wear which that carriage occa&s;ions of the roads. But when it is applied to any other purpo&s;e, each carriage is &s;uppo&s;ed to pay for more than that tear and wear, and contributes to the &s;upply of &s;ome other exigency of the &s;tate. But as the turnpike toll rai&s;es the price of goods in proportion to their weight, and not to their value, it is chiefly paid by the con&s;umers of coar&s;e and bulky, not by tho&s;e of precious and light commodities. Whatever exigency of the &s;tate therefore this tax might be intended to &s;upply, that exigency would be chiefly &s;upplied at the expence of the poor, not of the rich; at the expence of tho&s;e who are lea&s;t able to &s;upply it, not of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t able.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, if government &s;hould at any time neglect the repa|ration of the high roads, it would be &s;till more difficult than it is at pre&s;ent to compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large revenue might thus be levied upon the people, without any part of it being applied to the only purpo&s;e to which a revenue levied in this manner ought ever to be ap|plied. If the meanne&s;s and poverty of the tru&s;tees of turnpike roads render it &s;ometimes difficult at pre&s;ent to oblige them to repair their wrong; their wealth and greatne&s;s would render it ten times more &s;o in the ca&s;e which is here &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN France the funds de&s;tined for the reparation of the high roads are under the immediate direction of the executive power. Tho&s;e funds con&s;i&s;t partly in the &s;ix days labour which the country people are in mo&s;t parts of Europe obliged to give to the repa|ration
<PB N="337" REF="339">
of the highways; and partly in &s;uch a portion of the ge|neral revenue of the &s;tate as the king chu&s;es to &s;pare from his other expences.</P>
<P>BY the antient law of France, as well as by that of mo&s;t other parts of Europe, the &s;ix days labour was under the direction of a local or provincial magi&s;tracy, which had no immediate depen|dency upon the king's council. But by the pre&s;ent practice both the &s;ix days labour, and whatever other fund the king may chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ign for the reparation of the high roads in any particular province or generality, are entirely under the management of the intendant; an officer who is appointed and removed by the king's council, who receives his orders from it, and is in con&s;tant corre&s;|pondence with it. In the progre&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m the authority of the executive power gradually ab&s;orbs that of every other power in the &s;tate, and a&s;&s;umes to it&s;elf the management of every branch of reve|nue which is de&s;tined for any public purpo&s;e. In France, however, the great po&s;t roads, the roads which make the communication be|tween the principal towns of the kingdom, are in general kept in good order; and in &s;ome provinces are even a good deal &s;uperior to the greater part of the turnpike roads of England. But what we call the cro&s;s roads, that is, the far greater part of the roads in the country, are entirely neglected, and are in many places ab&s;olutely impa&s;&s;able for any heavy carriage. In &s;ome places it is even dan|gerous to travel on hor&s;eback, and mules are the only conveyance which can &s;afely be tru&s;ted. The proud mini&s;ter of an o&s;tenta|tious court may frequently take plea&s;ure in executing a work of &s;plendor and magnificence, &s;uch as a great highway which is fre|quently &s;een by the principal nobility, who&s;e applau&s;es, not only flatter his vanity, but even contribute to &s;upport his intere&s;t at court. But to execute a great number of little works, in which nothing that can be done can make any great appearance, or excite the &s;malle&s;t degree of admiration in any traveller, and
<PB N="338" REF="340">
which, in &s;hort, have nothing to recommend them but their ex|treme utility, is a bu&s;ine&s;s which appears in every re&s;pect too mean and paultry to merit the attention of &s;o great a magi&s;trate. Under &s;uch an admini&s;tration, therefore, &s;uch works are almo&s;t always entirely neglected.</P>
<P>IN China, and in &s;everal other governments of A&s;ia, the execu|tive power charges it&s;elf both with the reparation of the high roads, and with the maintenance of the navigable canals. In the in&s;tructions which are given to the governor of each province, tho&s;e objects, it is &s;aid, are con&s;tantly recommended to him, and the judgement which the court forms of his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to have paid to this part of his in&s;tructions. This branch of public police accordingly is &s;aid to be very much attended to in all tho&s;e countries, but particularly in China, where the high roads, and &s;till more the navigable canals, it is pretended, exceed very much every thing of the &s;ame kind which is known in Europe. The accounts of tho&s;e works, however, which have been tran&s;mitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by weak and wondering travellers, frequently by &s;tupid and lying mi&s;&s;ionaries. If they had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if the accounts of them had been reported by more faithful witne&s;&s;es, they would not perhaps appear to be &s;o wonderful. The account which Bernier gives of &s;ome works of this kind in Indo&s;tan, falls very much &s;hort of what had been reported of them by other travellers more di&s;po&s;ed to the marvellous than he was. It may too perhaps be in tho&s;e countries as it is in France, where the great roads, the great communications which are likely to be the &s;ubjects of con|ver&s;ation at the court and in the capital, are attended to, and all the re&s;t neglected. In China, be&s;ides, in Indo&s;tan, and in &s;everal other governments of A&s;ia, the revenue of the &s;overeign ari&s;es almo&s;t altogether from a land-tax or land-rent, which ri&s;es or falls
<PB N="339" REF="341">
with the ri&s;e or fall of the annual produce of the land. The great intere&s;t of the &s;overeign, therefore, his revenue, is in &s;uch coun|tries nece&s;&s;arily and immediately connected with the cultivation of the land, with the greatne&s;s of its produce, and with the value of its produce. But in order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as po&s;&s;ible, it is nece&s;&s;ary to procure to it as exten&s;ive a market as po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;equently to e&s;tabli&s;h the free&s;t, the ea&s;ie&s;t, and the lea&s;t expen&s;ive communication between all the different parts of the country, which can be done only by means of the be&s;t roads and the be&s;t navigable canals. But the revenue of the &s;overeign does not in any part of Europe ari&s;e chiefly from a land-tax or land-rent. In all the great kingdoms of Europe, perhaps the greater part of it may ultimately depend upon the produce of the land: But that dependency is neither &s;o immediate, nor &s;o evident. In Europe, therefore, the &s;overeign does not feel him&s;elf &s;o directly called upon to promote the increa&s;e, both in quantity and value, of the produce of the land, or, by maintain|ing good roads and canals, to provide the mo&s;t exten&s;ive market for that produce. Though it &s;hould be true, therefore, what I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that in &s;ome parts of A&s;ia this department of the public police is very properly managed by the executive power, there is not the lea&s;t probability that, during the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it could be tolerably managed by that power in any part of Europe.</P>
<P>EVEN tho&s;e public works which are of &s;uch a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining them&s;elves, but of which the conveniency is nearly confined to &s;ome particular place or di&s;trict, are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local or provincial admini|&s;tration, than by the general revenue of the &s;tate, of which the executive power mu&s;t always have the management. Were the
<PB N="340" REF="342">
&s;treets of London to be lighted and paved at the expence of the trea&s;ury, is there any probability that they would be &s;o well lighted and paved as they are at pre&s;ent, or even at &s;o &s;mall an expence? The expence be&s;ides, in&s;tead of being rai&s;ed by a local tax upon the inhabitants of each particular &s;treet, pari&s;h, or di&s;trict in Lon|don, would, in this ca&s;e, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the &s;tate, and would con&s;equently be rai&s;ed by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the greater part derive no &s;ort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the &s;treets of London.</P>
<P>THE abu&s;es which &s;ometimes creep into the local and provincial admini&s;tration of a local and provincial revenue, how enormous &s;oever they may appear, are in reality, however, almo&s;t always very trifling in compari&s;on of tho&s;e which commonly take place in the admini&s;tration and expenditure of the revenue of a great empire. They are, be&s;ides, much more ea&s;ily corrected. Under the local or provincial admini&s;tration of the ju&s;tices of the peace in Great Bri|tain, the &s;ix days labour which the country people are obliged to give to the reparation of the highways, is not always perhaps very judiciou&s;ly applied, but it is &s;carce ever exacted with any circum|&s;tance of cruelty or oppre&s;&s;ion. In France, under the admini&s;tra|tion of the intendants, the application is not always more judi|cious, and the exaction is frequently the mo&s;t cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive. Such Corv&eacute;es, as they are called, make one of the principal in&s;tru|ments of tyranny by which the intendant cha&s;ti&s;es any pari&s;h or communaut&eacute; which has had the misfortune to fall under his di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>THE in&s;titutions for the education of the youth may in the &s;ame manner furni&s;h a revenue &s;ufficient for defraying their own
<PB N="341" REF="343">
expence. The fee or honorary which the &s;cholar pays to the ma&s;ter naturally con&s;titutes a revenue of this kind.</P>
<P>EVEN where the reward of the ma&s;ter does not ari&s;e altogether from this natural revenue, it &s;till is not nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be derived from that general revenue of the &s;ociety of which the col|lection and application is in mo&s;t countries a&s;&s;igned to the execu|tive power. Through the greater part of Europe accordingly the endowment of &s;chools and colleges makes either no charge upon that general revenue, or but a very &s;mall one. It every where ari&s;es chiefly from &s;ome local or provincial revenue, from the rent of &s;ome landed e&s;tate, or from the intere&s;t of &s;ome &s;um of money allotted and put under the management of tru&s;tees for this particular pur|po&s;e, &s;ometimes by the &s;overeign him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes by &s;ome private donor.</P>
<P>HAVE tho&s;e public endowments contributed in general to pro|mote the end of their in&s;titution? Have they contributed to encou|rage the diligence, and to improve the abilities of the teachers? Have they directed the cour&s;e of education towards objects more u&s;eful, both to the individual and to the public, than tho&s;e to which it would naturally have gone of its own accord? It &s;hould not &s;eem very difficult to give at lea&s;t a probable an&s;wer to each of tho&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>IN every profe&s;&s;ion the exertion of the greater part of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it is always in proportion to the nece&s;&s;ity they are under of making that exertion. This nece&s;&s;ity is greate&s;t with tho&s;e to whom the emoluments of their profe&s;&s;ion are the only &s;ource from which they expect their fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. In order to acquire this fortune, or even to get this &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, they mu&s;t, in the cour&s;e of the year, execute a certain
<PB N="342" REF="344">
quantity of work of a known value; and, where the competition is free, the rival&s;hip of competitors, who are all endeavouring to ju&s;tle one another out of employment, obliges every man to endea|vour to execute his work with a certain degree of exactne&s;s. The greatne&s;s of the objects which are to be acquired by &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ome particular profe&s;&s;ions may, no doubt, &s;ometimes animate the exer|tion of a few men of extraordinary &s;pirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are evidently not nece&s;&s;ary in order to occa&s;ion the greate&s;t exertions. Rival&s;hip and emulation render excellency, even in mean profe&s;&s;ions, an object of ambition, and frequently occa&s;ion the very greate&s;t exertions. Great objects, on the con|trary, alone and un&s;upported by the nece&s;&s;ity of application, have &s;eldom been &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion any con&s;iderable exertion. In England, &s;ucce&s;s in the profe&s;&s;ion of the law leads to &s;ome very great objects of ambition; and yet how few men, born to ea&s;y fortunes, have ever in this country been eminent in that pro|fe&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>THE endowments of &s;chools and colleges have nece&s;&s;arily dimi|ni&s;hed more or le&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity of application in the teachers. Their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;o far as it ari&s;es from their &s;alaries, is evidently derived from a fund altogether independent of their &s;ucce&s;s and reputation in their particular profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome univer&s;ities the &s;alary makes but a part, and frequently but a &s;mall part of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part ari&s;es from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The nece&s;&s;ity of application, though always more or le&s;s dimini&s;hed, is not in this ca&s;e entirely taken away. Reputation in his profe&s;&s;ion is &s;till of &s;ome importance to him, and he &s;till has &s;ome dependency upon the affection, gratitude, and favourable report of tho&s;e who have attended upon his in&s;tructions, and the&s;e favourable &s;enti|ments
<PB N="343" REF="345">
he is likely to gain in no way &s;o well as by de&s;erving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence with which he di&s;charges every part of this duty.</P>
<P>IN other univer&s;ities the teacher is prohibited from receiving any honorary or fee from his pupils, and his &s;alary con&s;titutes the whole of the revenue which he derives from his office. His inte|re&s;t is, in this ca&s;e, &s;et as directly in oppo&s;ition to his duty as it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;et it. It is the intere&s;t of every man to live as much at his ea&s;e as he can; and if his emoluments are to be preci&s;ely the &s;ame whether he does, or does not perform &s;ome very laborious duty, it is certainly his intere&s;t, at lea&s;t as intere&s;t is vulgarly un|der&s;tood, either to neglect it altogether, or, if he is &s;ubject to &s;ome authority which will not &s;uffer him to do this, to perform it in as carele&s;s and &s;lovenly a manner as that authority will permit. If he is naturally active and a lover of labour, it is his intere&s;t to employ that activity in any way, from which he can derive &s;ome advantage, rather than in the performance of his duty, from which he can derive none.</P>
<P>IF the authority to which he is &s;ubject re&s;ides in the body corpo|rate, the college, or univer&s;ity, of which he him&s;elf is a member, and in which the greater part of the other members are, like him&s;elf, per&s;ons who either are or ought to be teachers, they are likely to make a common cau&s;e, to be all very indulgent to one another, and every man to con&s;ent that his neighbour may neglect his duty, provided he him&s;elf is allowed to neglect his own. In the univer|&s;ity of Oxford, the greater part of the public profe&s;&s;ors have, for the&s;e many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.</P>

per&s;ons, in the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, for example; in the governor of the province; or, perhaps, in &s;ome mini&s;ter of &s;tate, it is not indeed in this ca&s;e very likely that he will be &s;uffered to neglect his duty altogether. All that &s;uch &s;uperiors, however, can force him to do is to attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a certain number of lectures in the week or in the year. What tho&s;e lectures &s;hall be, mu&s;t &s;till depend upon the diligence of the teacher; and that diligence is likely to be pro|portioned to the motives which he has for exerting it. An extra|neous juri&s;diction of this kind, be&s;ides, is liable to be exerci&s;ed both ignorantly and capriciou&s;ly. In its nature it is arbitrary and di&s;cre|tionary, and the per&s;ons who exerci&s;e it, neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher them&s;elves, nor perhaps under&s;tanding the &s;ciences which it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to teach, are &s;eldom capable of exerci&s;ing it with judgement. From the in&s;olence of office too they are frequently indifferent how they exerci&s;e it, and are very apt to cen&s;ure or deprive him of his office wantonly, and without any ju&s;t cau&s;e. The per&s;on &s;ubject to &s;uch juri&s;diction is nece&s;&s;arily degraded by it, and, in&s;tead of being one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, is rendered one of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible per&s;ons in the &s;ociety. It is by powerful protection only that he can effectually guard him|&s;elf again&s;t the bad u&s;age to which he is at all times expo&s;ed; and this protection he is mo&s;t likely to gain, not by ability or diligence in his profe&s;&s;ion, but by ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to the will of his &s;uperiors, and by being ready, at all times, to &s;acrifice to that will the rights, the intere&s;t, and the honour of the body corporate of which he is a member. Whoever has attended for any con&s;iderable time to the admini&s;tration of a French univer&s;ity, mu&s;t have had occa&s;ion to remark the effects which naturally re&s;ult from an arbitrary and extraneous juri&s;diction of this kind.</P>

<P>THE privileges of graduates in arts, in law, in phy&s;ic, and divinity, when they can be obtained only by re&s;iding a certain num|ber of years in certain univer&s;ities, nece&s;&s;arily force a certain number of &s;tudents to &s;uch univer&s;ities independent of the merit or reputa|tion of the teachers. The privileges of graduates are a &s;ort of &s;tatutes of apprentice&s;hip, which have contributed to the improve|ment of education, ju&s;t as other &s;tatutes of apprentice&s;hip have to that of arts and manufactures.</P>
<P>THE charitable foundations of &s;cholar&s;hips, exhibitions, bura&s;a|ries, &amp;c. nece&s;&s;arily attach a certain number of &s;tudents to certain colleges, independent altogether of the merit of tho&s;e particular colleges. Were the &s;tudents upon &s;uch charitable foundations left free to chu&s;e what college they liked be&s;t, &s;uch liberty might perhaps contribute to excite &s;ome emulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which prohibited even the independent members of every particular college from leaving it, and going to any other, without leave fir&s;t a&s;ked and obtained of that which they meant to abandon, would tend very much to extingui&s;h that emulation.</P>
<P>IF in each college the tutor or teacher who was to in&s;truct each &s;tudent in all arts and &s;ciences, &s;hould not be voluntarily cho&s;en by the &s;tudent, but appointed by the head of the college; and if in ca&s;e of neglect, inability, or bad u&s;age, the &s;tudent &s;hould not be allowed to change him for another without leave fir&s;t a&s;ked and obtained; &s;uch a regulation would not only tend very much to extingui&s;h all emulation among the different tutors of the
<PB N="346" REF="348">
&s;ame college, but to dimini&s;h very much in all of them the nece&s;&s;ity of diligence and of attention to their re&s;pective pupils. Such teachers, though very well paid by their &s;tudents, might be as much di&s;po&s;ed to neglect them as tho&s;e who are not paid by them at all, or who have no other recompence but their &s;alary.</P>
<P>IF the teacher happens to be a man of &s;en&s;e, it mu&s;t be an unplea&s;ant thing to him to be con&s;cious, while he is lecturing his &s;tudents, that he is either &s;peaking or reading non&s;en&s;e, or what is very little better than non&s;en&s;e. It mu&s;t too be unplea&s;ant to him to ob&s;erve that the greater part of his &s;tudents de&s;ert his lectures; or perhaps attend upon them with plain enough marks of neglect, contempt and deri&s;ion. If he is obliged, therefore, to give a certain number of lectures, the&s;e motives alone, without any other intere&s;t, might di&s;po&s;e him to take &s;ome pains to give tolerably good ones. Several different expedients, however, may be fallen upon which will effectually blunt the edge of all tho&s;e incitements to diligence. The teacher, in&s;tead of explaining to his pupils him&s;elf, the &s;cience in which he propo&s;es to in&s;truct them, may read &s;ome book upon it; and if this book is written in a foreign and dead language, by interpreting it to them into their own; or, what would give him &s;till le&s;s trouble, by making them interpret it to him, and by now and then making an occa&s;ional remark upon it, he may flatter him&s;elf that he is giving a lecture. The &s;lighte&s;t degree of knowledge and application will enable him to do this with|out expo&s;ing him&s;elf to contempt or deri&s;ion, or &s;aying any thing that is really fooli&s;h, ab&s;urd, or ridiculous. The di&s;cipline of the college at the &s;ame time may enable him to force all his pupils to the mo&s;t regular attendance upon this &s;ham-lecture, and to maintain the mo&s;t decent and re&s;pectful behaviour during the whole time of the performance.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349">
THE di&s;cipline of colleges and univer&s;ities is in general contrived not for the benefit of the &s;tudents, but for the intere&s;t, or more properly &s;peaking, for the ea&s;e of the ma&s;ters. Its object is in all ca&s;es to maintain the authority of the ma&s;ter, and whether he neglects or performs his duty, to oblige the &s;tudents in all ca&s;es to behave to him as if he performed it with the greate&s;t diligence and ability. It &s;eems to pre&s;ume perfect wi&s;dom and virtue in the one order and the greate&s;t weakne&s;s and folly in the other. Where the ma&s;ters, however, really perform their duty, there are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the &s;tudents ever neglect theirs. No di&s;cipline is ever requi&s;ite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending, as is well known where-ever any &s;uch lectures are given. Force and re&s;traint may no doubt be in &s;ome degree requi&s;ite in order to oblige children or very young boys to attend to tho&s;e parts of education which it is thought nece&s;&s;ary for them to acquire during that early period of life; but after twelve or thirteen years of age, provided the ma&s;ter does his duty, force or re&s;traint can &s;carce ever be nece&s;&s;ary to carry on any part of education. Such is the genero&s;ity of the greater part of young men, that, &s;o far from being di&s;po&s;ed to neglect or de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;tructions of their ma&s;ter, provided he &s;hows &s;ome &s;erious intention of being of u&s;e to them, they are generally inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectne&s;s in the performance of his duty, and &s;ometimes even to conceal from the publick a good deal of gro&s;s negligence.</P>
<P>THOSE parts of education, it is to be ob&s;erved, for the teaching of which there are no publick in&s;titutions, are generally the be&s;t taught. When a young man goes to a fencing or a dancing &s;chool, he does not indeed always learn to fence or to dance very well; but he &s;eldom fails of learning to fence or to dance. The good effects of the riding &s;chool are not commonly &s;o evident. The expence of a
<PB N="348" REF="350">
riding &s;chool is &s;o great, that in mo&s;t places it is a publick in&s;titution. The three mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of literary education, to read, write, and account, it &s;till continues to be more common to acquire in private than in publick &s;chools; and it very &s;eldom happens that any body fails of acquiring them to the degree in which it is nece&s;|&s;ary to acquire them.</P>
<P>IN England the publick &s;chools are much le&s;s corrupted than the univer&s;ities. In the &s;chools the youth are taught, or at lea&s;t may be taught, Greek and Latin, that is, every thing which the ma&s;ters pretend to teach, or which, it is expected, they &s;hould teach. In the univer&s;ities the youth neither are taught, nor always can find any proper means of being taught, the &s;ciences which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e incorporated bodies to teach. The reward of the &s;choolma&s;ter in mo&s;t ca&s;es depends principally, in &s;ome ca&s;e almo&s;t entirely, upon the fees or honoraries of his &s;cholars. Schools have no exclu&s;ive privileges. In order to obtain the honours of gradua|tion, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that a per&s;on &s;hould bring a certificate of his having &s;tudied a certain number of years at a publick &s;chool. If upon examination he appears to under&s;tand what is taught there, no que&s;tions are a&s;ked about the place where he learnt it.</P>
<P>THE parts of education which are commonly taught in univer&s;i|ties, it may perhaps be &s;aid, are not very well taught. But had it not been for tho&s;e in&s;titutions they would not have been com|monly taught at all, and both the individual and the public would have &s;uffered a good deal from the want of tho&s;e important parts of education.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent univer&s;ities of Europe were originally, the greater part of them, eccle&s;ia&s;tical corporations; in&s;tituted for the educa|tion of churchmen. They were founded by the authority of the
<PB N="349" REF="351">
pope, and were &s;o entirely under his immediate protection, that their members, whether ma&s;ters or &s;tudents, had all of them what was then called the benefit of clergy, that is, were ex|empted from the civil juri&s;diction of the countries in which their re&s;pective univer&s;ities were &s;ituated, and were amenable only to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical tribunals. What was taught in the greater part of tho&s;e univer&s;ities was, &s;uitable to the end of their in&s;titution, either theology, or &s;omething that was merely preparatory to theology.</P>
<P>WHEN chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, a corrupted latin had become the common language of all the we&s;tern parts of Europe. The &s;ervice of the church accordingly, and the tran&s;la|tion of the Bible, which was read in churches, were both in that corrupted latin, that is, in the common language of the country. After the irruption of the barbarous nations who overturned the Roman empire, latin gradually cea&s;ed to be the language of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally pre|&s;erves the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms and ceremonies of religion, long after the circum&s;tances which fir&s;t introduced and rendered them rea|&s;onable are no more. Though latin, therefore, was no longer under&s;tood any where by the great body of the people, the whole &s;ervice of the church &s;till continued to be performed in that lan|guage. Two different languages were thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe, in the &s;ame manner as in antient Egypt; a language of the prie&s;ts, and a language of the people; a &s;acred and a profane; a learned and an unlearned language. But it was nece&s;&s;ary that the prie&s;ts &s;hould under&s;tand &s;omething of that &s;acred and learned language in which they were to officiate; and the &s;tudy of the latin lan|guage therefore made from the beginning an e&s;&s;ential part of univer&s;ity education.</P>
<P>IT was not &s;o with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language. The infallible decrees of the church had pronounced
<PB N="350" REF="352">
the latin tran&s;lation of the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vul|gate, to have been equally dictated by divine in&s;piration, and therefore of equal authority with the Greek and Hebrew originals. The knowledge of tho&s;e two languages, therefore, not being in|di&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite to a churchman, the &s;tudy of them did not for a long time make a nece&s;&s;ary part of the common cour&s;e of univer&s;ity education. There are &s;ome Spani&s;h univer&s;ities, I am a&s;&s;ured, in which the &s;tudy of the Greek language has never yet made any part of that cour&s;e. The fir&s;t reformers found the Greek text of the new te&s;tament and even the Hebrew text of the old more favourable to their opinions than the vulgate tran&s;lation, which, as might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, had been gradually accom|modated to &s;upport the doctrines of the catholic church. They &s;et them&s;elves therefore to expo&s;e the many errors of that tran&s;la|tion, which the Roman catholic clergy were thus put under the nece&s;&s;ity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done without &s;ome knowledge of the original languages, of which the &s;tudy was therefore gradually introduced into the greater part of univer&s;ities; both of tho&s;e which embraced and of tho&s;e which rejected the doctrines of the reformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that cla&s;&s;ical learning, which, though at fir&s;t principally cultivated by catholics and Italians, happened to come into fa&s;hion much about the &s;ame time that the doctrines of the reformation were &s;et on foot. In the greater part of univer&s;ities therefore that language was taught previous to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and as &s;oon as the &s;tudent had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the latin. The Hebrew language having no connection with cla&s;&s;ical learning, and, except the holy &s;criptures, being the language of not a &s;ingle book in any e&s;teem, the &s;tudy of it did not commonly commence till after that of philo|&s;ophy, and when the &s;tudent had entered upon the &s;tudy of theology.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="353">
ORIGINALLY the fir&s;t rudiments both of the Greek and Latin languages were taught in univer&s;ities, and they &s;till continue to be &s;o in &s;ome univer&s;ities. In others it is expected that the &s;tudent &s;hould have previou&s;ly acquired at lea&s;t the rudiments of one or both of tho&s;e languages, of which the &s;tudy continues to make every where a very con&s;iderable part of univer&s;ity education.</P>
<P>THE antient Greek philo&s;ophy was divided into three great branches; phy&s;ics, or natural philo&s;ophy; ethics, or moral philo|&s;ophy; and logic. This general divi&s;ion &s;eems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.</P>
<P>THE great phenomena of nature, the revolution of the hea|venly bodies, eclip&s;es, comets, thunder, lightning, and other extraordinary meteors, the generation, the life, growth, and di&s;|&s;olution of plants and animals, are objects which, as they naturally excite the wonder, &s;o they nece&s;&s;arily call forth the curio&s;ity of mankind to enquire into their cau&s;es. Super&s;tition fir&s;t attempted to &s;atisfy this curio&s;ity by referring all tho&s;e wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philo&s;ophy afterwards en|deavoured to account for them, from more familiar cau&s;es, or from &s;uch as mankind were better acquainted with, than the agency of the gods. As tho&s;e great phenomena are the fir&s;t objects of human curio&s;ity, &s;o the &s;cience which pretends to explain them mu&s;t naturally have been the fir&s;t branch of philo|&s;ophy that was cultivated. The fir&s;t philo&s;ophers accordingly of whom hi&s;tory has pre&s;erved any account, appear to have been natural philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>IN every age and country of the world men mu&s;t have attended to the characters, de&s;igns, and actions of one another, and many reputable rules and maxims for the conduct of human life, mu&s;t have been laid down and approved of by common con&s;ent. As
<PB N="352" REF="354">
&s;oon as writing came into fa&s;hion, wi&s;e men, or tho&s;e who fancied them&s;elves &s;uch, would naturally endeavour to increa&s;e the num|ber of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed and re&s;pected maxims, and to expre&s;s their own &s;en&s;e of what was either proper or improper conduct, &s;ome|times in the more artificial form of apologues, like what are called the fables of Ae&s;op; and &s;ometimes in the more &s;imple one of apophthegms, or wi&s;e &s;ayings, like the Proverbs of Solomon, the ver&s;es of Theognis and Phocyllides, and &s;ome part of the works of He&s;iod. They might continue in this manner for a long time merely to multiply the number of tho&s;e maxims of prudence and morality, without even attempting to arrange them in any very di&s;tinct or methodical order, much le&s;s to connect them together by one or more general principles, from which they were all deducible like effects from their natural cau&s;es. The beauty of a &s;y&s;tematical arrangement of different ob&s;ervations connected by a few common principles, was fir&s;t &s;een in the rude e&s;&s;ays of tho&s;e antient times towards a &s;y&s;tem of natural philo&s;ophy. Something of the &s;ame kind was afterwards attempted in morals. The maxims of common life were arranged in &s;ome methodical order, and connected together by a few common prin|ciples, in the &s;ame manner as they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of nature. The &s;cience which pretends to inve&s;tigate and explain tho&s;e connecting principles, is what is properly called moral philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT authors gave different &s;y&s;tems both of natural and moral philo&s;ophy. But the arguments by which they &s;upported tho&s;e different &s;y&s;tems, far from being always demon&s;trations, were frequently at be&s;t but very &s;lender probabilities, and &s;ometimes mere &s;ophi&s;ms, which had no other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language. Speculative &s;y&s;tems have in all ages of the world been adopted for rea&s;ons too frivolous to have determined the judgement of any man of common &s;en&s;e, in
<PB N="353" REF="355">
a matter of the &s;malle&s;t pecuniary intere&s;t. Gro&s;s &s;ophi&s;try has &s;carce ever had any influence upon the opinions of mankind, except in matters of philo&s;ophy and &s;peculation; and in the&s;e it has frequently had the greate&s;t. The patrons of each &s;y&s;tem of natural and moral philo&s;ophy naturally endeavoured to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of the arguments adduced to &s;upport the &s;y&s;tems which were oppo&s;ite to their own. In examining tho&s;e arguments, they were nece&s;&s;arily led to con&s;ider the difference between a probable and a demon&s;trative argument, between a fallacious and a con|clu&s;ive one; and Logic, or the &s;cience of the general principles of good and bad rea&s;oning, nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e out of the ob&s;ervations which a &s;crutiny of this kind gave occa&s;ion to. Though in its origin po&s;terior both to phy&s;ics and to ethics, it was commonly taught, not indeed in all, but in the greater part of the antient &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, previou&s;ly to either of tho&s;e &s;ciences. The &s;tudent, it &s;eems to have been thought, ought to under&s;tand well the difference between good and bad rea&s;oning, before he was led to rea&s;on upon &s;ubjects of &s;o great importance.</P>
<P>THIS antient divi&s;ion of philo&s;ophy into three parts was in the greater part of the univer&s;ities of Europe, changed for another into five.</P>
<P>IN the antient philo&s;ophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature either of the human mind or of the Deity, made a part of the &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ics. Tho&s;e beings, in whatever their e&s;&s;ence might be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t, were parts of the great &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and parts too productive of the mo&s;t important effects. Whatever human rea&s;on could either conclude or conjecture concerning them made, as it were, two chapters, though no doubt two very important ones, of the &s;cience which pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="354" REF="356">
of the univer&s;e. But in the univer&s;ities of Europe, where philo|&s;ophy was taught only as &s;ub&s;ervient to theology, it was natural to dwell longer upon tho&s;e two chapters than upon any other of the &s;cience. Tho&s;e two chapters were gradually more and more extend|ed, and were divided into many inferior chapters, till at la&s;t the doctrine of &s;pirits, of which &s;o little can be known, came to take up as much room in the &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy as the doctrine of bodies, of which &s;o much can be known. The doctrines concern|ing tho&s;e two &s;ubjects were con&s;idered as making two di&s;tinct &s;ci|ences. What was called Metaphy&s;ics or Pneumatics was &s;et in oppo&s;ition to Phy&s;ics, and was cultivated not only as the more &s;ub|lime, but, for the purpo&s;es of a particular profe&s;&s;ion, as the more u&s;eful &s;cience of the two. The proper &s;ubject of experiment and ob&s;ervation, a &s;ubject in which a careful attention is capable of making &s;o many u&s;eful di&s;coveries, was almo&s;t entirely neglected. The &s;ubject in which, after a few very &s;imple and almo&s;t obvious truths, the mo&s;t careful attention can di&s;cover nothing but ob&s;cu|rity and uncertainty, and can con&s;equently produce nothing but &s;ubtleties and &s;ophi&s;ms, was greatly cultivated.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e two &s;ciences had thus been &s;et in oppo&s;ition to one another, the compari&s;on between them naturally gave birth to a third, to what was called Ontology, or the &s;cience which treated of the qualities and attributes which were common to both the &s;ubjects of the other two &s;ciences. But if &s;ubtleties and &s;ophi&s;ms compo&s;ed the greater part of the Metaphy&s;ics or Pneumatics of the &s;chools, they compo&s;ed the whole of this cobweb &s;cience of Onto|logy, which was likewi&s;e &s;ometimes called Metaphy&s;ics.</P>
<P>WHEREIN con&s;i&s;ted the happine&s;s and perfection of a man, con&s;idered not only as an individual, but as the member of a family, of a &s;tate, and of the great &s;ociety of mankind, was the
<PB N="355" REF="357">
object which the antient moral philo&s;ophy propo&s;ed to inve&s;tigate. In that philo&s;ophy the duties of human life were treated of as &s;ub|&s;ervient to the happine&s;s and perfection of human life. But when moral, as well as natural philo&s;ophy, came to be taught only as &s;ub&s;ervient to theology, the duties of human life were treated of as chiefly &s;ub&s;ervient to the happine&s;s of a life to come. In the antient philo&s;ophy the perfection of virtue was repre&s;ented as nece&s;|&s;arily productive, to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, of the mo&s;t per|fect happine&s;s in this life. In the modern philo&s;ophy it was fre|quently repre&s;ented as generally, or rather as almo&s;t always incon|&s;i&s;tent with any degree of happine&s;s in this life; and heaven was to be earned only by penance and mortification, by the au&s;terities and aba&s;ement of a monk; not by the liberal, generous, and &s;pirited conduct of a man. Ca&s;ui&s;try and an a&s;cetic morality made up in mo&s;t ca&s;es the greater part of the moral philo&s;ophy of the &s;chools. By far the mo&s;t important of all the different branches of philo&s;o|phy, became in this manner by far the mo&s;t corrupted.</P>
<P>SUCH, therefore, was the common cour&s;e of philo&s;ophical edu|cation in the greater part of the univer&s;ities of Europe. Logic was taught fir&s;t: Ontology came in the &s;econd place: Pneumato|logy, comprehending the doctrine concerning the nature of the human &s;oul and of the Deity, in the third: In the fourth followed a deba&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of Moral philo&s;ophy, which was con&s;idered as immediately connected with the doctrines of Pneumatology, with the immortality of the human &s;oul, and with the rewards and puni&s;hments which, from the ju&s;tice of the Deity, were to be expected in a life to come: A &s;hort and &s;uperficial &s;y&s;tem of Phy|&s;ics u&s;ually concluded the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE alterations which the univer&s;ities of Europe thus intro|duced into the antient cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy, were all meant for the
<PB N="356" REF="358">
education of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and to render it a more proper introduc|tion to the &s;tudy of theology. But the additional quantity of &s;ub|tlety and &s;ophi&s;try; the ca&s;ui&s;try and the a&s;cetic morality which tho&s;e alterations introduced into it, certainly did not render it more proper for the education of gentlemen or men of the world, or more likely either to improve the under&s;tanding, or to mend the heart.</P>
<P>THIS cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy is what &s;till continues to be taught in the greater part of the univer&s;ities of Europe; with more or le&s;s diligence, according as the con&s;titution of each particular uni|ver&s;ity happens to render diligence more or le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the teachers. In &s;ome of the riche&s;t and be&s;t endowed univer&s;i|ties the tutors content them&s;elves with teaching a few unconnected &s;hreds and parcels of this corrupted cour&s;e; and even the&s;e they commonly teach very negligently and &s;uperficially.</P>
<P>THE improvements which, in modern times, have been made in &s;everal different branches of philo&s;ophy, have not, the greater part of them, been made in univer&s;ities; though &s;ome no doubt have. The greater part of univer&s;ities have not even been very forward to adopt tho&s;e improvements after they were made; and &s;everal of tho&s;e learned &s;ocieties have cho&s;en to remain for a long time the &s;anctuaries in which exploded &s;y&s;tems and ob&s;olete prejudices found &s;helter and protection, after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the world. In general, the riche&s;t and be&s;t endowed uni|ver&s;ities have been the &s;lowe&s;t in adopting tho&s;e improvements, and the mo&s;t aver&s;e to permit any con&s;iderable change in the e&s;tabli&s;hed plan of education. Tho&s;e improvements were more ea&s;ily intro|duced into &s;ome of the poorer univer&s;ities, in which the teachers, depending upon their reputation for the greater part of their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, were obliged to pay more attention to the current opinions of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="359">
BUT though the publick &s;chools and univer&s;ities of Europe were originally intended only for the education of a particular profe&s;&s;ion, that of churchmen; and though they were not always very dili|gent in in&s;tructing their pupils even in the &s;ciences which were &s;up|po&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary for that profe&s;&s;ion, yet they gradually drew to them|&s;elves the education of almo&s;t all other people, particularly of almo&s;t all gentlemen and men of fortune. No better method, it &s;eems, could be fallen upon of &s;pending, with any advantage, the long interval between infancy and that period of life at which men begin to apply in good earne&s;t to the real bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, the bu&s;ine&s;s which is to employ them during the remainder of their days. The greater part of what is taught in &s;chools and univer|&s;ities, however, does not &s;eem to be the mo&s;t proper preparation for that bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN England, it becomes every day more and more the cu&s;tom to &s;end young people to travel in foreign countries immediately upon their leaving &s;chool, and without &s;ending them to any univer&s;ity. Our young people, it is &s;aid, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young man who goes abroad at &s;eventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one and twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went abroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in three or four years. In the cour&s;e of his travels he generally acquires &s;ome knowledge of one or two foreign languages; a knowledge, however, which is &s;el|dom &s;ufficient to enable him either to &s;peak or write them with pro|priety. In other re&s;pects he commonly returns home more conceited, more unprincipled, more di&s;&s;ipated, and more incapable of any &s;erious application either to &s;tudy or to bu&s;ine&s;s, than he could well have become in &s;o &s;hort a time had he lived at home. By travel|ling &s;o very young, by &s;pending in the mo&s;t frivolous di&s;&s;ipation the mo&s;t precious years of his life, at a di&s;tance from the in&s;pec|tion
<PB N="358" REF="360">
and controul of his parents and relations, every u&s;eful habit which the earlier parts of his education might have had &s;ome ten|dency to form in him, in&s;tead of being rivetted and confirmed, is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily either weakened or effaced. Nothing but the di&s;credit into which the univer&s;ities are allowing them&s;elves to fall, could ever have brought into repute &s;o very ab&s;urd a practice as that of travelling at this early period of life. By &s;ending his &s;on abroad, a father delivers him&s;elf, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, from &s;o di&s;|agreeable an object as that of a &s;on unemployed, neglected, and going to ruin before his eyes.</P>
<P>SUCH have been the effects of &s;ome of the modern in&s;titutions for education.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT plans and different in&s;titutions for education &s;eem to have taken place in other ages and nations.</P>
<P>IN the republics of antient Greece, every free citizen was in&s;truct|ed, under the direction of the public magi&s;trate, in gymna&s;tic exer|ci&s;es and in mu&s;ic. By gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es it was intended to har|den his body, to &s;harpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of war; and as the Greek militia was, by all accounts, one of the be&s;t that ever was in the world, this part of their public education mu&s;t have an&s;wered completely the purpo&s;e for which it was intended. By the other part, mu&s;ic, it was pro|po&s;ed, at lea&s;t by the philo&s;ophers and hi&s;torians who have given us an account of tho&s;e in&s;titutions, to humanize the mind, to &s;often the temper, and to di&s;po&s;e it for performing all the &s;ocial and moral duties both of public and private life.</P>
<P>IN antient Rome the exerci&s;es of the Campus Martius an&s;wered the &s;ame purpo&s;e as tho&s;e of the Gymnazium in antient Greece,
<PB N="359" REF="361">
and they &s;eem to have an&s;wered it equally well. But among the Romans there was nothing which corre&s;ponded to the mu&s;ical edu|cation of the Greeks. The morals of the Romans, however, both in private and public life, &s;eem to have been not only equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Greeks. That they were &s;uperior in private life we have the expre&s;s te&s;timony of Polybius and of Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us; two authors well acquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor of the Greek and Roman hi&s;tory bears witne&s;s to the &s;uperiority of the public morals of the Romans. The good temper and moderation of con|tending factions &s;eems to be the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance in the public morals of a free people. But the factions of the Greeks were almo&s;t always violent and &s;anguinary; whereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been &s;hed in any Roman faction; and from the time of the Gracchi the Roman republic may be con&s;idered as in reality di&s;&s;olved. Notwith&s;tanding, therefore, the very re&s;pect|able authority of Plato, Ari&s;totle, and Polybius, and notwith|&s;tanding the very ingenious rea&s;ons by which Mr. Monte&s;quieu endeavours to &s;upport that authority, it &s;eems probable that the mu&s;ical education of the Greeks had no great effect in mending their morals, &s;ince, without any &s;uch education, tho&s;e of the Ro|mans were upon the whole &s;uperior. The re&s;pect of tho&s;e antient &s;ages for the in&s;titutions of their ance&s;tors had probably di&s;po&s;ed them to find much political wi&s;dom in what was, perhaps, merely an antient cu&s;tom, continued without interruption from the ear|lie&s;t period of tho&s;e &s;ocieties to the times in which they had arrived at a con&s;iderable degree of refinement. Mu&s;ic and dancing are the great amu&s;ements of almo&s;t all barbarous nations, and the great accompli&s;hments which are &s;uppo&s;ed to fit any man for enter|taining his &s;ociety. It is &s;o at this day among the negroes on the coa&s;t of Africa. It was &s;o among the antient Celtes, among the antient Scandinavians, and, as we may learn from Homer, among
<PB N="360" REF="362">
the antient Greeks in the times preceding the Trojan war. When the Greek tribes had formed them&s;elves into little republics, it was natural that the &s;tudy of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments &s;hould for a long time make a part of the public and common education of the people.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;ters who in&s;tructed the young people either in mu&s;ic or in military exerci&s;es, do not &s;eem to have been paid, or even appointed by the &s;tate, either in Rome, or even in Athens, the Greek republic of who&s;e laws and cu&s;toms we are the be&s;t informed. The &s;tate required that every free citizen &s;hould fit him&s;elf for defending it in war, and &s;hould, upon that account, learn his military exerci&s;es. But it left him to learn them of &s;uch ma&s;ters as he could find, and it &s;eems to have advanced nothing for this purpo&s;e but a public field or place of exerci&s;e, in which he &s;hould practi&s;e and perform them.</P>
<P>IN the early ages both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other parts of education &s;eem to have con&s;i&s;ted in learning to read, write, and account, according to the arithmetic of the times. The&s;e accompli&s;hments the richer citizens &s;eem frequently to have acquired at home by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome dome&s;tic pedagogue, who was generally either a &s;lave or a freed-man; and the poorer citizens in the &s;chools of &s;uch ma&s;ters as made a trade of teaching for hire. Such parts of education, however, were abandoned altogether to the care of the parents or guardians of each individual. It does not appear that the &s;tate ever a&s;&s;umed any in&s;pection or direction of them. By a law of Solon, indeed, the children were acquitted from maintaining in their old age tho&s;e parents who had neglected to in&s;truct them in &s;ome profitable trade or bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of refinement, when philo&s;ophy and rhetoric came into fa&s;hion, the better &s;ort of people u&s;ed to &s;end their chil|dren
<PB N="361" REF="363">
to the &s;chools of philo&s;ophers and rhetoricians, in order to be in&s;tructed in tho&s;e fa&s;hionable &s;ciences. But tho&s;e &s;chools were not &s;upported by the public. They were for a long time barely tole|rated by it. The demand for philo&s;ophy and rhetoric was for a long time &s;o &s;mall, that the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed teachers of either could not find con&s;tant employment in any one city, but were obliged to travel about from place to place. In this manner lived Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, and many others. As the demand increa&s;ed, the &s;chools both of philo&s;ophy and rhetoric became &s;tationary; fir&s;t in Athens, and afterwards in &s;everal other cities. The &s;tate however &s;eems never to have encouraged them further than by a&s;&s;igning to &s;ome of them a particular place to teach in, which was &s;ometimes done too by private donors. The &s;tate &s;eems to have a&s;&s;igned the Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to Ari&s;totle, and the Portico to Zeno of Citta the founder of the Stoics. But Epicurus bequeathed his gardens to his own &s;chool. Till about the time of Marcus Antoninus however, no teacher ap|pears to have had any &s;alary from the public, or to have had any other emoluments, but what aro&s;e from the honoraries or fees of his &s;cholars. The bounty which that philo&s;ophical emperor, as we learn from Lucian, be&s;towed upon the teachers of philo&s;ophy, probably la&s;ted no longer than his own life. There was nothing equivalent to the privileges of graduation, and to have attended any of tho&s;e &s;chools was not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to be permitted to prac|ti&s;e any particular trade or profe&s;&s;ion. If the opinion of their own utility could not draw &s;cholars to them, the law neither forced any body to go to them, nor rewarded any body for having gone to them. The teachers had no juri&s;diction over their pupils, nor any other authority be&s;ides that natural authority which &s;uperior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people towards tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with any part of their edu|cation.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="364">
AT Rome, the &s;tudy of the civil law made a part of the edu|cation, not of the greater part of the citizens, but of &s;ome par|ticular families. The young people however, who wi&s;hed to acquire knowledge in the law, had no public &s;chool to go to, and had no other method of &s;tudying it than by frequenting the company of &s;uch of their relations and friends, as were &s;uppo&s;ed to under|&s;tand it. It is perhaps worth while to remark, that though the laws of the twelve tables were many of them copied from tho&s;e of &s;ome antient Greek republics, yet law never &s;eems to have grown up to be a &s;cience in any republic of antient Greece. In Rome it became a &s;cience very early, and gave a con&s;iderable degree of illu&s;tration to tho&s;e citizens who had the reputation of under|&s;tanding it. In the republics of antient Greece, particularly in Athens, the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ted of numerous and therefore di&s;orderly bodies of people, who frequently decided almo&s;t at random, or as clamour, faction, and party &s;pirit hap|pened to determine. The ignominy of an unju&s;t deci&s;ion, when it was to be divided among five hundred, a thou&s;and, or fifteen hundred people, (for &s;ome of their courts were &s;o very numer|ous) could not fall very heavy upon any individual. At Rome, on the contrary, the principal courts of ju&s;tice con&s;i&s;ted either of a &s;ingle judge, or of a &s;mall number of judges, who&s;e characters, e&s;pecially as they deliberated always in public, could not fail to be very much affected by any ra&s;h or unju&s;t deci&s;ion. In doubtful ca&s;es, &s;uch courts, from their anxiety to avoid blame, would naturally endeavour to &s;helter them&s;elves under the example or precedent of the judges who had &s;at before them either in the &s;ame or in &s;ome other court. This attention to practice and precedent nece&s;&s;arily formed the Roman law into that regular and orderly &s;y&s;tem in which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention has had the like effects upon the laws of every other country where &s;uch attention has taken place. The &s;upe|riority of character in the Romans over that of the Greeks, &s;o
<PB N="363" REF="365">
much remarked by Polybius and Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, was probably more owing to the better con&s;titution of their courts of ju&s;tice, than to any of the circum&s;tances to which tho&s;e authors a&s;cribe it. The Romans are &s;aid to have been particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their &s;uperior re&s;pect to an oath. But the people who were accu&s;tomed to make oath only before &s;ome diligent and well informed court of ju&s;tice, would naturally be much more attentive to what they &s;wore, than they who were accu&s;tomed to do the &s;ame thing before mobbi&s;h and di&s;orderly a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>THE abilities both civil and military of the Greeks and Romans will readily be allowed to have been at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of any modern nation. Our prejudice is perhaps rather to over-rate them. But except in what related to military exerci&s;es, the &s;tate &s;eems to have been at no pains to form tho&s;e great abilities: for I cannot be induced to believe that the mu&s;ical education of the Greeks could be of much con&s;equence in forming them. Ma&s;ters, however, had been found, it &s;eems, for in&s;tructing the better &s;ort of people among tho&s;e nations in every art and &s;cience in which the circum&s;tances of their &s;ociety rendered it nece&s;&s;ary or conve|nient for them to be in&s;tructed. The demand for &s;uch in&s;truction produced, what it always produces, the talent for giving it; and the emulation which an unre&s;trained competition never fails to excite, appears to have brought that talent to a very high degree of perfection. In the attention which the antient philo&s;ophers excited, in the empire which they acquired over the opinions and principles of their auditors, in the faculty which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of giving a certain tone and character to the conduct and conver&s;a|tion of tho&s;e auditors; they appear to have been much &s;uperior to any modern teachers. In modern times, the diligence of public teachers is more or le&s;s corrupted by the circum&s;tances, which render them more or le&s;s independent of their &s;ucce&s;s and repu|tation in their particular profe&s;&s;ions. Their &s;alaries too put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition with
<PB N="364" REF="366">
them, in the &s;ame &s;tate with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty, in competition with tho&s;e who trade with a con|&s;iderable one. If he &s;ells his goods at nearly the &s;ame price, he can|not have the &s;ame profit, and poverty and beggary at lea&s;t, if not bankruptcy and ruin, will infallibly be his lot. If he attempts to &s;ell them much dearer, he is likely to have &s;o few cu&s;tomers that his circum&s;tances will not be much mended. The privileges of graduation, be&s;ides, are in many countries nece&s;&s;ary, or at lea&s;t extremely convenient to mo&s;t men of learned profe&s;&s;ions, that is, to the far greater part of tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion for a learned education. But tho&s;e privileges can be obtained only by attend|ing the lectures of the public teachers. The mo&s;t careful attendance upon the able&s;t in&s;tructions of any private teacher, cannot always give any title to demand them. It is from the&s;e different cau&s;es that the private teacher of any of the &s;ciences which are com|monly taught in univer&s;ities, is in modern times generally con|&s;idered as in the very lowe&s;t order of men of letters. A man of real abilities can &s;carce find out a more humiliating or a more unprofitable employment to turn them to. The endowments of &s;chools and colleges have in this manner not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have rendered it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have any good private ones.</P>
<P>WERE there no public in&s;titutions for education, no &s;y&s;tem, no &s;cience would be taught for which there was not &s;ome de|mand; or which the circum&s;tances of the times did not render it, either nece&s;&s;ary, or convenient, or at lea&s;t fa&s;hionable to learn. A private teacher could never find his account in teach|ing either an exploded and antiquated &s;y&s;tem of a &s;cience acknow|leged to be u&s;eful, or a &s;cience univer&s;ally believed to be a mere u&s;ele&s;s and pedantic heap of &s;ophi&s;try and non&s;en&s;e. Such &s;y&s;tems, &s;uch &s;ciences, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t no where but in tho&s;e incor|porated &s;ocieties for education who&s;e pro&s;perity and revenue are in a great mea&s;ure independent of their reputation, and alto|gether
<PB N="365" REF="367">
independent of their indu&s;try. Were there no public in&s;ti|tutions for education, a gentleman, after going through with application and abilities the mo&s;t complete cour&s;e of education, which the circum&s;tances of the times were &s;uppo&s;ed to afford, could not come into the world completely ignorant of every thing which is the common &s;ubject of conver&s;ation among gen|tlemen and men of the world.</P>
<P>THERE are no public in&s;titutions for the education of women, and there is accordingly nothing u&s;ele&s;s, ab&s;urd, or fanta&s;tical in the common cour&s;e of their education. They are taught what their parents or guardians judge it nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful for them to learn; and they are taught nothing el&s;e. Every part of their education tends evidently to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e; either to im|prove the natural attractions of their per&s;on, or to form their mind to re&s;erve, to mode&s;ty, to cha&s;tity, and to oeconomy: to render them both likely to become the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of a family, and to behave properly when they have become &s;uch. In every part of her life a woman feels &s;ome conveniency or advantage from every part of her education. It &s;eldom happens that a man in any part of his life derives any conveniency or advantage from &s;ome of the mo&s;t laborious and trouble&s;ome parts of his education.</P>
<P>OUGHT the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be a&s;ked, to the education of the people? Or if it ought to give any, what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people? and in what manner ought it to attend to them?</P>
<P>IN &s;ome ca&s;es the &s;tate of the &s;ociety nece&s;&s;arily places the greater part of individuals in &s;uch &s;ituations as naturally form in them, without any attention of government, almo&s;t all the abili|ties and virtues which that &s;tate requires, or perhaps can admit
<PB N="366" REF="368">
of. In other ca&s;es the &s;tate of the &s;ociety does not place the greater part of individuals in &s;uch &s;ituations, and &s;ome attention of government is nece&s;&s;ary in order to prevent the almo&s;t entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of the divi&s;ion of labour, the employment of the far greater part of tho&s;e who live by labour, that is, of the great body of the people, comes to be confined to a very few &s;imple operations; frequently to one or two. But the under|&s;tandings of the greater part of men are nece&s;&s;arily formed by their ordinary employments. The man who&s;e whole life is &s;pent in performing a few &s;imple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame, has no occa&s;ion to exert his under&s;tanding, or to exerci&s;e his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally lo&s;es, therefore, the habit of &s;uch exertion, and generally becomes as &s;tupid and ignorant as it is po&s;&s;ible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him, not only incapable of reli&s;hing or bearing a part in any rational conver&s;ation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender &s;entiment, and con&s;equently of forming any ju&s;t judgement concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and exten&s;ive intere&s;ts of his country, he is altogether incapable of judging; and unle&s;s very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwi&s;e, he is equally incapable of defend|ing his country in war. The uniformity of his &s;tationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with abhorrence the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a &s;oldier. It corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his &s;trength with vigour and per&s;everance in any other employment than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade &s;eems in this manner to be acquired at the expence of his intellectual,
<PB N="367" REF="369">
&s;ocial, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilized &s;ociety this is the &s;tate into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall, unle&s;s government takes &s;ome pains to prevent it.</P>
<P>IT is otherwi&s;e in the barbarous &s;ocieties, as they are commonly called, of hunters, of &s;hepherds, and even of hu&s;bandmen in that rude &s;tate of hu&s;bandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures, and the exten&s;ion of foreign commerce. In &s;uch &s;ocieties the varied occupations of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity, and to invent expedients for removing difficul|ties which are continually occurring. Invention is kept alive, and the minds of men are not &s;uffered to fall into that drow&s;y &s;tupidity which in a civilized &s;ociety &s;eems to benumb the under|&s;tanding of almo&s;t all the inferior ranks of people. In tho&s;e bar|barous &s;ocieties, as they are called, every man, it has already been ob&s;erved, is a warrior. Every man too is in &s;ome mea&s;ure a &s;tate&s;man, and can form a tolerable judgement concerning the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety, and the conduct of tho&s;e who govern it. How far their chiefs are good judges in peace, or good leaders in war, is obvious to the ob&s;ervation of almo&s;t every &s;ingle man among them. In &s;uch a &s;ociety indeed, no man can well acquire that improved and refined under&s;tanding which a few men &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;s in a more civilized &s;tate. Though in a rude &s;ociety there is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every individual, there is not a great deal in tho&s;e of the whole &s;ociety. Every man does, or is capable of doing, almo&s;t every thing which any other man does or is capable of doing. Every man has a con&s;iderable degree of knowledge, ingenuity and invention; but &s;carce any man has a great degree. The degree, however, which is commonly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, is generally &s;ufficient for conducting the whole &s;imple bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ociety. In a civilized &s;tate, on the contrary, though there is little variety in the occupations of the
<PB N="368" REF="370">
greater part of individuals, there is an almo&s;t infinite variety in tho&s;e of the whole &s;ociety. The&s;e varied occupations pre&s;ent an almo&s;t infinite variety of objects to the contemplation of tho&s;e few who, being attached to no particular occupation them&s;elves, have lei&s;ure and inclination to examine the occupations of other people. The contemplation of &s;o great a variety of objects nece&s;&s;arily exer|ci&s;es their minds in endle&s;s compari&s;ons and combinations, and renders their under&s;tandings in an extraordinary degree both acute and comprehen&s;ive. Unle&s;s tho&s;e few, however, happen to be placed in &s;ome very particular &s;ituations, their great abilities, though honourable to them&s;elves, may contribute very little to the good government or happine&s;s of their &s;ociety. Notwith&s;tanding the great abilities of tho&s;e few, all the nobler parts of the human cha|racter may be in a great mea&s;ure obliterated and extingui&s;hed in the great body of the people.</P>
<P>THE education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilized and commercial &s;ociety, the attention of the public more than that of people of &s;ome rank and fortune. People of &s;ome rank and fortune are generally eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular bu&s;ine&s;s, profe&s;&s;ion, or trade, by which they propo&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in the world. They have before that full time to acquire, or at lea&s;t to fit them&s;elves for afterwards acquiring, every accompli&s;hment which can recommend them to the public e&s;teem, or render them worthy of it. Their parents or guardians are generally &s;ufficiently anxious that they &s;hould be &s;o accompli&s;hed, and are in mo&s;t ca&s;es willing enough to lay out the expence which is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. If they are not always properly educated, it is &s;eldom from the want of expence laid out upon their education; but from the improper application of that expence. It is &s;eldom from the want of ma&s;ters; but from the negligence and incapacity of the ma&s;ters who are to be had, and
<PB N="369" REF="371">
from the difficulty, or rather from the impo&s;&s;ibility which there is in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things of finding any better. The employ|ments too in which people of &s;ome rank or fortune &s;pend the greater part of their lives are not, like tho&s;e of the common people, &s;imple and uniform. They are almo&s;t all of them extremely com|plicated, and &s;uch as exerci&s;e the head more than the hands. The under&s;tandings of tho&s;e who are engaged in &s;uch employments can &s;eldom grow torpid from want of exerci&s;e. The employments of people of &s;ome rank and fortune, be&s;ides, are &s;eldom &s;uch as har|ra&s;s them from morning to night. They generally have a good deal of lei&s;ure, during which they may perfect them&s;elves in every branch either of u&s;eful or ornamental knowledge of which they may have laid the foundation, or for which they may have acquired &s;ome ta&s;te in the earlier part of life.</P>
<P>IT is otherwi&s;e with the common people. They have little time to &s;pare for education. Their parents can &s;carce afford to main|tain them even in infancy. As &s;oon as they are able to work, they mu&s;t apply to &s;ome trade by which they can earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. That trade too is generally &s;o &s;imple and uniform as to give little exerci&s;e to the under&s;tanding, while at the &s;ame time their labour is both &s;o con&s;tant and &s;o &s;evere, that it leaves them little lei&s;ure and le&s;s inclination to apply to, or even to think of any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT though the common people cannot in any civilized &s;ociety be &s;o well in&s;tructed as people of &s;ome rank and fortune, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at &s;o early a period of life, that the greater part even of tho&s;e who are to be bred to the lowe&s;t occupations, have time to acquire them before they can be employed in tho&s;e occu|pations. For a very &s;mall expence the public can facilitate, can encourage, and can even impo&s;e upon almo&s;t the whole body of

the people, the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of education.</P>
<P>THE public can facilitate this acqui&s;ition by e&s;tabli&s;hing in every pari&s;h or di&s;trict a little &s;chool, where children may be taught for a reward &s;o moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the ma&s;ter being partly, but not wholly paid by the public; becau&s;e if he was wholly, or even principally paid by it, he would &s;oon learn to neglect his bu&s;ine&s;s. In Scotland the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch pari&s;h &s;chools has taught almo&s;t the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion of them to write and account. In England the e&s;tabli&s;hment of charity &s;chools has had an effect of the &s;ame kind, though not &s;o univer&s;ally, becau&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment is not &s;o univer&s;al. If in tho&s;e little &s;chools the books by which the children are taught to read were a little more in&s;tructive than they commonly are; and if, in&s;tead of the little &s;mattering of Latin, which the children of the common people are &s;ometimes taught there, and which can &s;carce ever be of any u&s;e to them, they were in&s;tructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics, the literary education of this rank of people would perhaps be as complete as it is capable of being. There is &s;carce a common trade which does not afford &s;ome opportunities of apply|ing to it the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which would not therefore gradually exerci&s;e and improve the common people in tho&s;e principles, the nece&s;&s;ary introduction to the mo&s;t &s;ublime as well as to the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ciences.</P>
<P>THE public can encourage the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of education by giving &s;mall premiums, and little badges of di&s;tinction, to the children of the common people who excel in them.</P>
<P>THE public can impo&s;e upon almo&s;t the whole body of the people the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of education, by obliging every man to undergo an examination or probation in them
<PB N="371" REF="373">
before he can obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to &s;et up any trade either in a village or town corporate.</P>
<P>IT was in this manner, by facilitating the acqui&s;ition of their military and gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es, by encouraging it, and even by impo&s;ing upon the whole body of the people the nece&s;&s;ity of learn|ing tho&s;e exerci&s;es, that the Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial &s;pirit of their re&s;pective citizens. They facilitated the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e exerci&s;es by appointing a certain place for learning and practi&s;ing them, and by granting to certain ma&s;ters the privilege of teaching in that place. Tho&s;e ma&s;ters do not ap|pear to have had either &s;alaries or exclu&s;ive privileges of any kind. Their reward con&s;i&s;ted altogether in what they got from their &s;cho|lars; and a citizen who had learnt his exerci&s;es in the public Gym|na&s;ia, had no &s;ort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them privately, provided the latter had learnt them equally well. Tho&s;e republics encouraged the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e exerci&s;es by be&s;tow|ing little premiums and badges of di&s;tinction upon tho&s;e who excel|led in them. To have gained a prize in the Olympic, I&s;thmian or Nemaean games, gave illu&s;tration not only to the per&s;on who gained it, but to his whole family and kindred. The obligation which every citizen was under to &s;erve a certain number of years, if called upon, in the armies of the republic, &s;ufficiently impo&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of learning tho&s;e exerci&s;es without which he could not be fit for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THAT in the progre&s;s of improvement the practice of military exerci&s;es, unle&s;s government takes proper pains to &s;upport it, goes gradually to decay, and, together with it, the martial &s;pirit of the great body of the people, the example of modern Europe &s;uffi|ciently demon&s;trates. But the &s;ecurity of every &s;ociety mu&s;t always depend, more or le&s;s, upon the martial &s;pirit of the great body of the people. In the pre&s;ent times, indeed, that martial &s;pirit alone,
<PB N="372" REF="374">
and un&s;upported by a well di&s;ciplined &s;tanding army, would not perhaps be &s;ufficient for the defence and &s;ecurity of any &s;ociety. But where every citizen had the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier, a &s;maller &s;tand|ing army would &s;urely be requi&s;ite. That &s;pirit be&s;ides would nece&s;|&s;arily dimini&s;h very much the dangers to liberty, whether real or imaginary, which are commonly apprehended from a &s;tanding army. As it would very much facilitate the operations of that army again&s;t a foreign invader, &s;o it would ob&s;truct them as much if unfortu|nately they &s;hould ever be directed again&s;t the con&s;titution of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE antient in&s;titutions of Greece and Rome &s;eem to have been much more effectual for maintaining the martial &s;pirit of the great body of the people than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of what are called the mili|tias of modern times. They were much more &s;imple. When they were once e&s;tabli&s;hed, they executed them&s;elves, and it required little or no attention from government to maintain them in the mo&s;t perfect vigour. Whereas to maintain even in tolerable execution the complex regulations of any modern militia, requires the conti|nual and painful attention of government, without which they are con&s;tantly falling into total neglect and di&s;u&s;e. The influence be&s;ides of the antient in&s;titutions was much more univer&s;al. By means of them the whole body of the people was completely in&s;tructed in the u&s;e of arms. Whereas it is but a very &s;mall part of them who can ever be &s;o in&s;tructed by the regulations of any modern militia; except, perhaps, that of Switzerland. But a cow|ard, a man incapable either of defending or of revenging him&s;elf, evidently wants one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the character of a man. He is as much mutilated and deformed in his mind as another is in his body, who is either deprived of &s;ome of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential members, or has lo&s;t the u&s;e of tho&s;e members. He is evidently the more wretched and mi&s;erable of the two; becau&s;e happine&s;s and
<PB N="373" REF="375">
mi&s;ery, which re&s;ide altogether in the mind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful, the mutilated or entire &s;tate of the mind, than upon that of the body. Even though the mar|tial &s;pirit of the people were of no u&s;e towards the defence of the &s;ociety, yet to prevent that &s;ort of mental mutilation, deformity and wretchedne&s;s which cowardice nece&s;&s;arily involves in it, from &s;pread|ing them&s;elves through the great body of the people, would &s;till de&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of government; in the &s;ame man|ner as it would de&s;erve its mo&s;t &s;erious attention to prevent a lepro&s;y or any other loath&s;ome and offen&s;ive di&s;ea&s;e, though neither mortal nor dangerous, from &s;preading it&s;elf among them; though per|haps no other public good might re&s;ult from &s;uch attention be&s;ides the prevention of &s;o great a public evil.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the gro&s;s ignorance and &s;tupidity which, in a civilized &s;ociety, &s;eem &s;o frequently to benumb the under&s;tandings of all the inferior ranks of people. A man, with|out the proper u&s;e of the intellectual faculties of a man, is, if po&s;|&s;ible, more contemptible than even a coward, and &s;eems to be muti|lated and deformed in a &s;till more e&s;&s;ential part of the character of human nature. Though the &s;tate was to derive no advantage from the in&s;truction of the inferior ranks of people, it would &s;till de&s;erve its attention that they &s;hould not be altogether unin&s;tructed. The &s;tate, however, derives no incon&s;iderable advantage from their in&s;truction. The more they are in&s;tructed, the le&s;s liable they are to the delu&s;ions of enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, which, among igno|rant nations, frequently occa&s;ion the mo&s;t dreadful di&s;orders. An in&s;tructed and intelligent people be&s;ides are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and &s;tupid one. They feel them|&s;elves each individually more re&s;pectable, and more likely to obtain the re&s;pect of their lawful &s;uperiors, and they are therefore more di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;pect tho&s;e &s;uperiors. They are more di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="374" REF="376">
examine, and more capable of &s;eeing through, the intere&s;ted com|plaints of faction and &s;edition, and they are, upon that account, le&s;s apt to be mi&s;led into any wanton or unnece&s;&s;ary oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of government. In free countries, where the &s;afety of government depends very much upon the favourable judgement which the people may form of its conduct, it mu&s;t &s;urely be of the highe&s;t importance that they &s;hould not be di&s;po&s;ed to judge ra&s;hly or capriciou&s;ly concerning it.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE III. <HI>Of the Expence of the In&s;titutions for the In&s;truction of People of all Ages.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;titutions for the in&s;truction of people of all ages are chiefly tho&s;e for religious in&s;truction. This is a &s;pecies of in&s;truc|tion of which the object is not &s;o much to render the people good citizens in this world, as to prepare them for another and a better world in a life to come. The teachers of the doctrine which con|tains this in&s;truction, in the &s;ame manner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers; or they may derive it from &s;ome other fund to which the law of their country may entitle them; &s;uch as a landed e&s;tate, a tythe or land-tax, an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;alary or &s;tipend. Their exertion, their zeal and indu&s;try, are likely to be much greater in the former &s;ituation than in the latter. In this re&s;pect the teachers of new religions have always had a con&s;iderable advantage in attacking tho&s;e antient and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems of which the clergy, repo&s;ing them&s;elves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up the fervour of faith and devotion in the great body of the people; and having given them&s;elves up to indolence, were become altogether incapable of making any vigorous exertion in defence even of their own e&s;tabli&s;hment. The clergy of an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and well endowed religion frequently become men of learn|ing and elegance, who po&s;&s;e&s;s all the virtues of gentlemen, or which
<PB N="375" REF="377">
can recommend them to the e&s;teem of gentlemen; but they are apt gradually to lo&s;e the qualities, both good and bad, which gave them authority and influence with the inferior ranks of peo|ple, and which had perhaps been the original cau&s;es of the &s;ucce&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion. Such a clergy, when attacked by a &s;et of popular and bold, though perhaps &s;tupid and ignorant enthu&s;ia&s;ts, feel them&s;elves as perfectly defencele&s;s as the indolent, effeminate, and full-fed nations of the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia, when they were invaded by the active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the North. Such a clergy, upon &s;uch an emergency, have commonly no other re&s;ource than to call upon the civil magi&s;trate to per&s;e|cute, de&s;troy, or drive out their adver&s;aries as di&s;turbers of the public peace. It was thus that the Roman catholic clergy called upon the civil magi&s;trate to per&s;ecute the prote&s;tants; and the church of England to per&s;ecute the di&s;&s;enters; and that in general every religious &s;ect, when it has once enjoyed for a century or two the &s;ecurity of a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, has found it&s;elf incapable of making any vigorous defence again&s;t any new &s;ect which cho&s;e to attack its doctrine or di&s;cipline. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions the advan|tage in point of learning and good writing may &s;ometimes be on the &s;ide of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. But the arts of popularity, all the arts of gaining pro&s;elytes, are con&s;tantly on the &s;ide of its adver&s;aries. In England tho&s;e arts have been long neglected by the well-endowed clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and are at pre&s;ent chiefly culitvated by the di&s;&s;enters and by the methodi&s;ts. The independent provi&s;ions, however, which in many places have been made for di&s;&s;enting teachers, by means of voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions, of tru&s;t-rights, and other eva&s;ions of the law, &s;eem very much to have abated the zeal and activity of tho&s;e teachers. They have many of them become very learned, ingenious, and re&s;pectable men; but they have in general cea&s;ed to be very popular preachers. The methodi&s;ts, without half the learning of the di&s;&s;enters, are much more in vogue.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="378">
IN the church of Rome the indu&s;try and zeal of the inferior clergy is kept more alive by the powerful motive of &s;elf-intere&s;t than perhaps in any e&s;tabli&s;hed prote&s;tant church. The parochial clergy derive, many of them, a very con&s;iderable part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the voluntary oblations of the people; a &s;ource of revenue which confe&s;&s;ion gives them many opportunities of improv|ing. The mendicant orders derive their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from &s;uch oblations. It is with them, as with the hu&s;&s;ars and light infantry of &s;ome armies, no plunder, no pay. The parochial clergy are like tho&s;e teachers who&s;e reward depends partly upon their &s;alary, and partly upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils, and the&s;e mu&s;t always depend more or le&s;s upon their indu&s;try and reputation. The mendicant orders are like tho&s;e teachers who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends altogether upon their indu&s;try. They are obliged, therefore, to u&s;e every art which can animate the devotion of the common people. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the two great mendicant orders of St. Dominick and St. Francis, it is ob&s;erved by Machiavel, revived, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the langui&s;hing faith and devotion of the catholic church. In Roman catholic countries the &s;pirit of devotion is &s;upported altogether by the monks and by the poorer parochial clergy. The great dignitaries of the church, with all the accom|pli&s;hments of gentlemen and men of the world, and &s;ometimes with tho&s;e of men of learning, are careful enough to maintain the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline over their inferiors, but &s;eldom give them&s;elves any trouble about the in&s;truction of the people.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"MOST of the arts and profe&s;&s;ions in a &s;tate,"</Q> &s;ays, by far the mo&s;t illu&s;trious philo&s;opher and hi&s;torian of the pre&s;ent age, <Q REND="inline">"are of &s;uch a nature, that, while they promote the intere&s;ts of the &s;ociety, they are al&s;o u&s;eful or agreeable to &s;ome individuals; and in that ca&s;e, the con&s;tant rule of the magi&s;trate, except,
<PB N="377" REF="379">
perhaps, on the fir&s;t introduction of any art, is, to leave the profe&s;&s;ion to it&s;elf, and tru&s;t its encouragement to the indivi|duals who reap the benefit of it. The artizans finding their profits to ri&s;e by the favour of their cu&s;tomers, increa&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, their &s;kill and indu&s;try; and as matters are not di&s;turbed by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is always &s;ure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand.
<P>BUT there are al&s;o &s;ome callings, which, though u&s;eful and even nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;tate, bring no advantage or plea&s;ure to any individual, and the &s;upreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. It mu&s;t give them publick encouragement in order to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and it mu&s;t provide again&s;t that negligence to which they will naturally be &s;ubject, either by annexing particular honours to the profe&s;|&s;ion, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a long &s;ubordination of ranks and a &s;trict dependance, or by &s;ome other expedient. The per&s;ons employed in the finances, fleets, and magi&s;tracy, are in&s;tances of this order of men.</P>
<P>IT may naturally be thought, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics belong to the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and that their encouragement, as well as that of lawyers and phy&s;icians, may &s;afely be entru&s;ted to the liberality of individuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or con&s;olation from their &s;piritual mini&s;try and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their indu&s;try and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by &s;uch an additional motive; and their &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion, as well as their addre&s;s in governing the minds of the people, mu&s;t receive daily increa&s;e, from their increa&s;ing practice, &s;tudy, and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="380">
BUT if we con&s;ider the matter more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall find, that this intere&s;ted diligence of the clergy is what every wi&s;e legi&s;lator will &s;tudy to prevent; becau&s;e in every religion except the true, it is highly pernicious, and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infu&s;ing into it a &s;trong mixture of &s;uper|&s;tition, folly, and delu&s;ion. Each gho&s;tly practitioner, in order to render him&s;elf more precious and &s;acred in the eyes of his retainers, will in&s;pire them with the mo&s;t violent abhorrence of all other &s;ects, and continually endeavour, by &s;ome novelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience. No regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency in the doctrines inculcated. Every tenet will be adopted that be&s;t &s;uits the di&s;orderly affections of the human frame. Cu&s;tomers will be drawn to each conven|ticle by new indu&s;try and addre&s;s in practi&s;ing on the pa&s;&s;ions and credulity of the populace. And in the end, the civil magi&s;trate will find, that he has dearly paid for his pretended frugality, in &s;aving a fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment for the prie&s;ts; and that in reality the mo&s;t decent and advantageous compo&s;ition, which he can make with the &s;piritual guides, is to bribe their indolence, by a&s;&s;igning &s;tated &s;alaries to their profe&s;&s;ion, and rendering it &s;uperfluous for them to be farther active, than merely to prevent their flock from &s;traying in que&s;t of new pa&s;tures. And in this manner eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments, though commonly they aro&s;e at fir&s;t from religious views, prove in the end advantageous to the political intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P></Q></P>
<P>BUT whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent provi&s;ion of the clergy; it has, perhaps, been very &s;eldom be&s;towed upon them from any view to tho&s;e effects. Times of violent religious controver&s;y have generally been times of equally violent political faction. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions each political party has either found it, or imagined it, for its intere&s;t to league
<PB N="379" REF="381">
it&s;elf with &s;ome one or other of the contending religious &s;ects. But this could be done only by adopting, or at lea&s;t by favouring, the tenets of that particular &s;ect. The &s;ect which had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering party, nece&s;&s;arily &s;hared in the victory of its ally, by who&s;e favour and protection it was &s;oon enabled in &s;ome degree to &s;ilence and &s;ubdue all its adver&s;aries. Tho&s;e adver&s;aries had generally leagued them&s;elves with the enemies of the conquering party, and were therefore the enemies of that party. The clergy of this particular &s;ect having thus become complete ma&s;ters of the field, and their influence and authority with the great body of the people being in its highe&s;t vigour, they were powerful enough to over-awe the chiefs and leaders of their own party, and to oblige the civil magi&s;trate to re&s;pect their opinions and inclinations. Their fir&s;t demand was generally, that he &s;hould &s;ilence and &s;ubdue all their adver&s;aries; and their &s;econd, that he &s;hould be&s;tow an independent provi&s;ion on them&s;elves. As they had generally contributed a good deal to the victory, it &s;eemed not unrea&s;onable that they &s;hould have &s;ome &s;hare in the &s;poil. They were weary be&s;ides of humouring the people, and of depending upon their caprice for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In making this demand there|fore they con&s;ulted their own ca&s;e and comfort, without troubling them&s;elves about the effect which it might have in future times upon the influence and authority of their order. The civil magi|&s;trate, who could comply with this demand only by giving them &s;omething which he would have cho&s;en much rather to take or to keep to him&s;elf, was &s;eldom very forward to grant it. Nece&s;&s;ity, however, always forced him to &s;ubmit at la&s;t, though frequently not till after many delays, eva&s;ions, and affected excu&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT if politics had never called in the aid of religion, had the conquering party never adopted the tenets of one &s;ect more than tho&s;e of another, when it had gained the victory, it would proba|bly
<PB N="380" REF="382">
have dealt equally and impartially with all the different &s;ects, and have allowed every man to chu&s;e his own prie&s;t and his own religion as he thought proper. There would in this ca&s;e, no doubt, have been a great multitude of religious &s;ects. Almo&s;t every different congregation might probably have made a little &s;ect by it&s;elf, or have entertained &s;ome peculiar tenets of its own. Each teacher would no doubt have felt him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of making the utmo&s;t exertion, and of u&s;ing every art both to pre&s;erve and to increa&s;e the number of his di&s;ciples. But as every other teacher would have felt him&s;elf under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity; the &s;ucce&s;s of no one teacher, or &s;ect of teachers, could have been very great. The intere&s;ted and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and trouble&s;ome only where there is either but one &s;ect tolerated in the &s;ociety, or where the whole of a large &s;ociety is divided into two or three great &s;ects; the teachers of each &s;ect acting by concert, and under a regular di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination. But that zeal mu&s;t be altogether innocent where the &s;ociety is divided into two or three hundred, or perhaps into as many thou&s;and &s;mall &s;ects, of which no one could be con&s;iderable enough to di&s;turb the publick tranquillity. The teachers of each &s;ect, &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;ur|rounded on all &s;ides with more adver&s;aries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which is &s;o &s;eldom to be found among the teachers of tho&s;e great &s;ects, who&s;e tenets being &s;upported by the civil magi&s;trate, are held in veneration by almo&s;t all the inhabitants of exten&s;ive kingdoms and empires, and who therefore &s;ee nothing round them but followers, di&s;ciples, and humble admirers. The teachers of each little &s;ect, finding them&s;elves almo&s;t alone, would be obliged to re&s;pect tho&s;e of almo&s;t every other &s;ect, and the conce&s;&s;ions which they would mutually find it both convenient and agreeable to make to one another, might in time probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational religion, freefrom every mixture of ab&s;urdity, impo&s;ture, or
<PB N="381" REF="383">
fanatici&s;m, &s;uch as wi&s;e men have in all ages of the world wi&s;hed to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed; but &s;uch as po&s;itive law has perhaps never yet e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, and probably never will e&s;tabli&s;h in any country: becau&s;e with regard to religion, po&s;itive law always has been, and probably always will be, more or le&s;s influenced by popular &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;i|a&s;m. This plan of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, or more properly of no eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, was what the &s;ect called independents, a &s;ect no doubt of very wild enthu&s;ia&s;ts, propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h in England towards the end of the civil war. If it had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, though of a very unphilo&s;ophical origin, it would probably by this time have been productive of the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical good temper and moderation with regard to every &s;ort of religious prin|ciple. It has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Pen&s;ylvania, where, though the quakers happen to be the mo&s;t numerous &s;ect, the law in reality favours no one &s;ect more than another, and it is there &s;aid to have been productive of this philo&s;ophical good temper and mode|ration.</P>
<P>BUT though this equality of treatment &s;hould not be productive of this good temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of the religious &s;ects of a particular country; yet provided tho&s;e &s;ects were &s;ufficiently numerous, and each of them con&s;equently too &s;mall to di&s;turb the publick tranquillity, the exce&s;&s;ive zeal of each &s;ect for its particular tenets, could not well be productive of any very hurtful effects, but, on the contrary, of &s;everal good ones: and if the government was perfectly decided both to let them all alone, and to oblige them all to let alone one another, there is little danger that they would not of their own accord &s;ubdivide them&s;elves fa&s;t enough, &s;o as &s;oon to become &s;ufficiently numerous.</P>

always two different &s;chemes or &s;y&s;tems of morality current at the &s;ame time; of which the one may be called the &s;trict or au&s;tere; the other the liberal, or, if you will, the loo&s;e &s;y&s;tem. The former is generally admired and revered by the common people: The latter is commonly more e&s;teemed and adopted by what are called people of fa&s;hion. The degree of di&s;approbation with which we ought to mark the vices of levity, the vices which are apt to ari&s;e from great pro&s;perity, and from the exce&s;s of gaiety and good humour, &s;eems to con&s;titute the principal di&s;tinction between tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite &s;chemes or &s;y&s;tems. In the liberal or loo&s;e &s;y&s;tem, luxury, wanton and even di&s;orderly mirth, the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure to &s;ome degree of intemperance, the breach of cha&s;tity, at lea&s;t in one of the two &s;exes, &amp;c. provided they are not accompanied with gro&s;s indecency, and do not lead to fal&s;hood or inju&s;tice, are generally treated with a good deal of indulgence, and are ea&s;ily either excu&s;ed or pardoned altogether. In the au&s;tere &s;y&s;tem, on the contrary, tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es are regarded with the utmo&s;t abhorrence and dete&s;tation. The vices of levity are always ruinous to the common people, and a &s;ingle week's thoughtle&s;ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation is often &s;ufficient to undo a poor workman for ever, and to drive him through de&s;pair upon committing the mo&s;t enormous crimes. The wi&s;er and better &s;ort of the common people, there|fore, have always the utmo&s;t abhorrence and dete&s;tation of &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, which their experience tells them are &s;o immediately fatal to people of their condition. The di&s;order and extravagance of &s;everal years, on the contrary, will not always ruin a man of fa&s;hion, and people of that rank are very apt to con&s;ider the power of indulging in &s;ome degree of exce&s;s as one of the ad|vantages of their fortune, and the liberty of doing &s;o without cen&s;ure or reproach, as one of the privileges which belong to their &s;tation. In people of their own &s;tation, therefore, they regard &s;uch exce&s;&s;es with but a &s;mall degree of di&s;approbation, and cen|&s;ure them either very &s;lightly or not at all.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="385">
ALMOST all religious &s;ects have begun among the common people, from whom they have generally drawn their earlie&s;t, as well as their mo&s;t numerous pro&s;elytes. The au&s;tere &s;y&s;tem of morality has, accordingly, been adopted by tho&s;e &s;ects almo&s;t con|&s;tantly, or with very few exceptions; for there have been &s;ome. It was the &s;y&s;tem by which they could be&s;t recommend them&s;elves to that order of people to whom they fir&s;t propo&s;ed their plan of reformation upon what had been before e&s;tabli&s;hed. Many of them, perhaps the greater part of them, have even endeavoured to gain credit by refining upon this au&s;tere &s;y&s;tem, and by carrying it to &s;ome degree of folly and extravagance; and this exce&s;&s;ive rigour has frequently recommended them more than any thing el&s;e to the re&s;pect and veneration of the common people.</P>
<P>A MAN of rank and fortune is by his &s;tation the di&s;tingui&s;hed member of a great &s;ociety, who attend to every part of his con|duct, and who thereby oblige him to attend to every part of it him&s;elf. His authority and con&s;ideration depend very much upon the re&s;pect which this &s;ociety bears to him. He dare not do any thing which would di&s;grace or di&s;credit him in it, and he is obliged to a very &s;trict ob&s;ervation of that &s;pecies of morals, whe|ther liberal or au&s;tere, which the general con&s;ent of this &s;ociety pre&s;cribes to per&s;ons of his rank and fortune. A man of low condition, on the contrary, is far from being a di&s;tingui&s;hed member of any great &s;ociety. While he remains in a country village his conduct may be attended to, and he may be obliged to attend to it him&s;elf. In this &s;ituation, and in this &s;ituation only, he may have what is called a character to lo&s;e. But as &s;oon as he comes into a great city, he is &s;unk in ob&s;curity and darkne&s;s. His conduct is ob&s;erved and attended to by nobody, and he is therefore very likely to neglect it him&s;elf, and to abandon him&s;elf to every &s;ort of low profligacy and vice. He never emerges &s;o effectually from this ob&s;curity, his conduct never excites &s;o much
<PB N="384" REF="386">
the attention of any re&s;pectable &s;ociety, as by his becoming the member of a &s;mall religious &s;ect. He from that moment acquires a degree of con&s;ideration which he never had before. All his brother &s;ectaries are, for the credit of the &s;ect, inte|re&s;ted to ob&s;erve his conduct, and if he gives occa&s;ion to any &s;candal, if he deviates very much from tho&s;e au&s;tere morals which they almo&s;t always require of one another, to puni&s;h him by what is always a very &s;evere puni&s;hment, even where no civil effects attend it, expul&s;ion or excommunication from the &s;ect. In little religious &s;ects, accordingly, the morals of the common people have been almo&s;t always remarkably regular and orderly; generally much more &s;o than in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The morals of tho&s;e little &s;ects indeed have frequently been rather di&s;|agreeably rigorous and un&s;ocial.</P>
<P>THERE are two very ea&s;y and effectual remedies, however, by who&s;e joint operation the &s;tate might, without violence, correct whatever was un&s;ocial or di&s;agreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little &s;ects into which the country was divided.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of tho&s;e remedies is the &s;tudy of &s;cience and philo|&s;ophy, which the &s;tate might render almo&s;t univer&s;al among all people of middling or more than middling rank and fortune; not by giving &s;alaries to teachers in order to make them negli|gent and idle, but by in&s;tituting &s;ome &s;ort of probation, even in the higher and more difficult &s;ciences, to be undergone by every per&s;on before he was permitted to exerci&s;e any liberal profe&s;&s;ion, or before he could be received as a candidate for any honour|able office of tru&s;t or profit. If the &s;tate impo&s;ed upon this order of men the nece&s;&s;ity of learning, it would have no occa&s;ion to give it&s;elf any trouble about providing them with proper teachers. They would &s;oon find better teachers for them&s;elves than any whom the &s;tate could provide for them. Science is the
<PB N="385" REF="387">
great antidote to the poi&s;on of enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition; and where all the &s;uperior ranks of people were &s;ecured from it, the inferior ranks could not be much expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd of tho&s;e remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public diver&s;ions. The &s;tate, by encouraging, that is by giving entire liberty to all tho&s;e who for their own intere&s;t would attempt, without &s;candal or indecency, to amu&s;e and divert the people by painting, poetry, mu&s;ic, dancing; by all &s;orts of dramatic repre|&s;entations and exhibitions, would ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipate in the greater part of them that melancholy and gloomy humour which is almo&s;t always the nur&s;e of popular &s;uper&s;tition and enthu|&s;ia&s;m. Public diver&s;ions have always been the objects of dread and hatred, to all the fanatical promoters of tho&s;e popular fren|zies. The gaiety and good humour which tho&s;e diver&s;ions in&s;pire were altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with that temper of mind, which was fitte&s;t for their purpo&s;e, or which they could be&s;t work upon. Dramatic repre&s;entations be&s;ides, frequently expo&s;ing their artifices to public ridicule, and &s;ometimes even to public execration, were upon that account more than all other diver&s;ions the objects of their peculiar abhorrence.</P>
<P>IN a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion more than tho&s;e of another, it would not be nece&s;&s;ary that any of them &s;hould have any particular or imme|diate dependency upon the &s;overeign or executive power; or that he &s;hould have any thing to do either in appointing or in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them from their offices. In &s;uch a &s;ituation he would have no occa&s;ion to give him&s;elf any concern about them, further than to keep the peace among them in the &s;ame manner as among the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects; that is, to hinder them from per&s;ecuting, abu&s;ing, or oppre&s;&s;ing one another. But it is quite otherwi&s;e in countries where there is an e&s;tabli&s;hed or
<PB N="386" REF="388">
governing religion. The &s;overeign can in this ca&s;e never be &s;ecure, unle&s;s he has the means of influencing in a con&s;iderable degree the greater part of the teachers of that religion.</P>
<P>THE clergy of every e&s;tabli&s;hed church con&s;titute a great incor|poration. They can act in concert, and pur&s;ue their intere&s;t upon one plan and with one &s;pirit, as much as if they were under the direc|tion of one man; and they are frequently too under &s;uch direc|tion. Their intere&s;t as an incorporated body is never the &s;ame with that of the &s;overeign, and is &s;ometimes directly oppo&s;ite to it. Their great intere&s;t is to maintain their authority with the people; and this authority depends upon the &s;uppo&s;ed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they inculcate, and upon the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of adopting every part of it with the mo&s;t implicit faith, in order to avoid eternal mi&s;ery. Should the &s;overeign have the imprudence to appear either to deride or doubt him&s;elf of the mo&s;t trifling part of their doctrine, or from humanity attempt to protect tho&s;e who did either the one or the other, the punctilious honour of a clergy who have no &s;ort of dependency upon him, is immediately provoked to pro&s;cribe him as a profane per&s;on, and to employ all the terrors of religion in order to oblige the people to transfer their allegiance to &s;ome more orthodox and obedient prince. Should he oppo&s;e any of their preten&s;ions or u&s;urpations, the danger is equally great. The princes who have dared in this manner to rebel again&s;t the church, over and above this crime of rebellion, have generally been charged too with the additional crime of here&s;y, notwith&s;tanding their &s;olemn prote&s;tations of their faith and humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every tenet which &s;he thought proper to pre&s;cribe to them. But the authority of religion is &s;uperior to every other authority. The fears which it &s;ugge&s;ts conquer all other fears. When the autho|ri&s;ed teachers of religion propagate through the great body of the
<PB N="387" REF="389">
people doctrines &s;ubver&s;ive of the authority of the &s;overeign, it is by violence only, or by the force of a &s;tanding army, that he can maintain his authority. Even a &s;tanding army cannot in this ca&s;e give him any la&s;ting &s;ecurity; becau&s;e if the &s;oldiers are not foreign|ers, which can &s;eldom be the ca&s;e, but drawn from the great body of the people, which mu&s;t almo&s;t always be the ca&s;e, they are likely to be &s;oon corrupted by tho&s;e very doctrines. The revolutions which the turbulence of the Greek clergy was continually occa&s;ion|ing at Con&s;tantinople as long as the ea&s;tern empire &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; the convul&s;ions which, during the cour&s;e of &s;everal centuries, the tur|bulence of the Roman clergy was continually occa&s;ioning in every part of Europe, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate how precarious and in&s;e|cure mu&s;t always be the &s;ituation of the &s;overeign who has no pro|per means of influencing the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed and govern|ing religion of his country.</P>
<P>ARTICLES of faith, as well as all other &s;piritual matters, it is evident enough, are not within the proper department of a tempo|ral &s;overeign, who, though he may be very well qualified for pro|tecting, is &s;eldom &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o for in&s;tructing the people. With regard to &s;uch matters, therefore, his authority can &s;eldom be &s;ufficient to counterbalance the united authority of the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The public tranquillity, however, and his own &s;ecurity, may frequently depend upon the doctrines which they may think proper to propagate concerning &s;uch matters. As he can &s;eldom directly oppo&s;e their deci&s;ion, therefore, with proper weight and authority, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be able to influ|ence it; and he can influence it only by the fears and expectations which he may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order. Tho&s;e fears and expectations may con&s;i&s;t in the fear of depri|vation or other puni&s;hment, and in the expectation of further pre|ferment.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="390">
IN all chri&s;tian churches the benefices of the clergy are a &s;ort of freeholds which they enjoy, not during plea&s;ure, but during life, or good behaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable to be turned out upon every &s;light di&s;obligation either of the &s;overeign or of his mini&s;ters, it would perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible for them to maintain their authority with the people, who would then con&s;ider them as mercenary dependants upon the court, in the &s;incerity of who&s;e in&s;tructions they could no longer have any confidence. But &s;hould the &s;overeign attempt irregu|larly, and by violence to deprive any number of clergymen of their freeholds on account, perhaps, of their having propagated, with more than ordinary zeal, &s;ome factious or &s;editious doctrine, he would only render, by &s;uch per&s;ecution, both them and their doc|trine ten times more popular, and therefore ten times more trou|ble&s;ome and dangerous than they had been before. Fear is in almo&s;t all ca&s;es a wretched in&s;trument of government, and ought in par|ticular never to be employed again&s;t any order of men who have the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to independency. To attempt to terrify them &s;erves only to irritate their bad humour, and to confirm them in an oppo&s;ition which more gentle u&s;age perhaps might ea&s;ily induce them either to &s;often or to lay a&s;ide altogether. The violence which the French government u&s;ually employed in order to oblige all their parliaments or &s;overeign courts of ju&s;tice to enregi&s;ter any unpo|pular edict, very &s;eldom &s;ucceeded. The means commonly em|ployed, however, the impri&s;onment of all the refractory members, one would think were forcible enough. The princes of the hou&s;e of Steuart &s;ometimes employed the like means in order to influence &s;ome of the members of the parliament of England; and they generally found them equally intractable. The parliament of Eng|land is now managed in another manner; and a very &s;mall expe|riment which the duke of Choi&s;eul made about twelve years ago upon the parliament of Paris, demon&s;trated &s;ufficiently that all the
<PB N="389" REF="391">
parliaments of France might have been managed &s;till more ea&s;ily in the &s;ame manner. That experiment was not pur&s;ued. For though management and per&s;ua&s;ion are always the ea&s;ie&s;t and the &s;afe&s;t in&s;truments of government, as force and violence are the wor&s;t and the mo&s;t dangerous, yet &s;uch, it &s;eems, is the natu|ral in&s;olence of man, that he almo&s;t always di&s;dains to u&s;e the good in&s;trument, except when he cannot or dare not u&s;e the bad one. The French government could and dur&s;t u&s;e force, and therefore di&s;dained to u&s;e management and per&s;ua&s;ion. But there is no order of men, it appears, I believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is &s;o dangerous, or rather &s;o perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the re&s;pected clergy of any e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The rights, the privileges, the per&s;onal liberty of every individual eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who is upon good terms with his own order, are even in the mo&s;t de&s;potic governments more re&s;pected than tho&s;e of any other per&s;on of nearly equal rank and fortune. It is &s;o in every gradation of de&s;poti&s;m, from that of the gentle and mild government of Paris, to that of the violent and furious govern|ment of Con&s;tantinople. But though this order of men can &s;carce ever be forced, they may be managed as ea&s;ily as any other; and the &s;ecurity of the &s;overeign, as well as of the public tranquillity, &s;eems to depend very much upon the means which he has of managing them; and tho&s;e means &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t altogether in the preferment which he has to be&s;tow upon them.</P>
<P>IN the antient con&s;titution of the Roman catholic church, the bi&s;hop of each dioce&s;e was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of the epi&s;copal city. The people did not long retain their right of election; and while they did retain it, they almo&s;t always acted under the influence of the clergy, who in &s;uch &s;piritual matters appeared to be their natural guides. The clergy, however, &s;oon grew weary of the trouble of managing them, and
<PB N="390" REF="392">
found it ea&s;ier to elect their own bi&s;hops them&s;elves. The abbot, in the &s;ame manner, was elected by the monks of the mona&s;tery, at lea&s;t in the greater part of abbacies. All the inferior eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal benefices comprehended within the dioce&s;e were collated by the bi&s;hop, who be&s;towed them upon &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tics as he thought proper. All church preferments were in this manner in the di&s;|po&s;al of the church. The &s;overeign, though he might have &s;ome indirect influence in tho&s;e elections, and though it was &s;ometimes u&s;ual to a&s;k both his con&s;ent to elect, and his approbation of the election, yet had no direct or &s;ufficient means of managing the clergy. The ambition of every clergyman naturally led him to pay court, not &s;o much to his &s;overeign, as to his own order, from which only he could expect preferment.</P>
<P>THROUGH the greater part of Europe the Pope gradually drew to him&s;elf fir&s;t the collation of almo&s;t all bi&s;hopricks and abba|cies, or of what were called Con&s;i&s;torial benefices, and afterwards, by various machinations and pretences, of the greater part of infe|rior benefices comprehended within each dioce&s;e; little more being left to the bi&s;hop than what was barely nece&s;&s;ary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy. By this arrangement the con|dition of the &s;overeign was &s;till wor&s;e than it had been before. The clergy of all the different countries of Europe were thus formed into a &s;ort of &s;piritual army, di&s;per&s;ed in different quarters indeed, but of which all the movements and operations could now be directed by one head, and conducted upon one uniform plan. The clergy of each particular country might be con&s;idered as a particular detach|ment of that army, of which the operations could ea&s;ily be &s;up|ported and &s;econded by all the other detachments quartered in the different countries round about. Each detachment was not only independent of the &s;overeign of the country in which it was quar|tered, and by which it was maintained, but dependant upon a
<PB N="391" REF="393">
foreign &s;overeign, who could at any time turn its arms again&s;t the &s;overeign of that particular country, and &s;upport them by the arms of all the other detachments.</P>
<P>THOSE arms were the mo&s;t formidable that can well be imagined. In the antient &s;tate of Europe, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of arts and manufactures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the &s;ame &s;ort of influence over the common people, which that of the great barons gave them over their re&s;pective va&s;&s;als, tenants, and retain|ers. In the great landed e&s;tates which the mi&s;taken piety both of princes and private per&s;ons had be&s;towed upon the church, juri&s;|dictions were e&s;tabli&s;hed of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e of the great barons; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on. In tho&s;e great landed e&s;tates, the clergy or their bailiffs could ea&s;ily keep the peace without the &s;up|port or a&s;&s;i&s;tance either of the king or of any other per&s;on; and neither the king nor any other per&s;on could keep the peace there without the &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the clergy. The juri&s;dictions of the clergy, therefore, in their particular baronies or manors, were equally independent, and equally exclu&s;ive of the authority of the king's courts, as tho&s;e of the great temporal lords. The tenants of the clergy were, like tho&s;e of the great barons, almo&s;t all tenants at will, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and therefore liable to be called out at plea&s;ure, in order to fight in any quarrel in which the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above the rents of tho&s;e e&s;tates, the clergy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the tythes, a very large portion of the rents of all the other e&s;tates in every kingdom of Europe. The revenues ari&s;ing from both tho&s;e &s;pecies of rents were, the greater part of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. The quantity exceeded greatly what the clergy could them&s;elves con&s;ume; and there were neither arts nor manufactures for the produce of which they could exchange the &s;urplus. The clergy could derive advantage from this immen&s;e
<PB N="392" REF="394">
&s;urplus in no other way than by employing it, as the great barons employed the like &s;urplus of their revenues, in the mo&s;t profu&s;e ho&s;pitality, and in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive charity. Both the ho&s;pitality and the charity of the antient clergy, accordingly, are &s;aid to have been very great. They not only maintained almo&s;t the whole poor of every kingdom, but many knights and gentlemen had frequently no other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than by travelling about from mona|&s;tery to mona&s;tery, under pretence of devotion, but in reality to enjoy the ho&s;pitality of the clergy. The retainers of &s;ome parti|cular prelates were often as numerous as tho&s;e of the greate&s;t lay|lords; and the retainers of all the clergy taken together were, per|haps, more numerous than tho&s;e of all the lay-lords. There was always much more union among the clergy than among the lay|lords. The former were under a regular di&s;cipline and &s;ubordina|tion to the papal authority. The latter were under no regular di&s;|cipline or &s;ubordination, but almo&s;t always equally jealous of one another, and of the king. Though the tenants and retainers of the clergy, therefore, had both together been le&s;s numerous than tho&s;e of the great lay-lords, and their tenants were probably much le&s;s numerous, yet their union would have rendered them more for|midable. The ho&s;pitality and charity of the clergy too, not only gave them the command of a great temporal force, but increa&s;ed very much the weight of their &s;piritual weapons. Tho&s;e virtues procured them the highe&s;t re&s;pect and veneration among all the inferior ranks of people, of whom many were con&s;tantly, and almo&s;t all occa&s;ionally, fed by them. Every thing belonging or related to &s;o popular an order, its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, its privileges, its doc|trines, nece&s;&s;arily appeared &s;acred in the eyes of the common people, and every violation of them, whether real or pretended, the highe&s;t act of &s;acrilegious wickedne&s;s and profanene&s;s. In this &s;tate of things, if the &s;overeign frequently found it difficult to re&s;i&s;t the con|federacy of a few of the great nobility, we cannot wonder that he
<PB N="393" REF="395">
&s;hould find it &s;till more &s;o to re&s;i&s;t the united force of the clergy of his own dominions &s;upported by that of the clergy of all the neighbouring dominions. In &s;uch circum&s;tances the wonder is, not that he was &s;ometimes obliged to yield, but that he ever was able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE privileges of the clergy in tho&s;e antient times (which to us who live in the pre&s;ent times appear the mo&s;t ab&s;urd) their total exemption from the &s;ecular juri&s;diction, for example, or what in England was called the benefit of clergy; were the natural or rather the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of this &s;tate of things. How dangerous mu&s;t it have been for the &s;overeign to attempt to puni&s;h a clergy|man for any crime whatever, if his own order were di&s;po&s;ed to protect him, and to repre&s;ent either the proof as in&s;ufficient for convicting &s;o holy a man, or the puni&s;hment as too &s;evere to be inflicted upon one who&s;e per&s;on had been rendered &s;acred by reli|gion. The &s;overeign could, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, do no better than leave him to be tried by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, who, for the honour of their own order, were intere&s;ted to re&s;train, as much as po&s;&s;ible, every member of it from committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occa&s;ion to &s;uch gro&s;s &s;candal as might di&s;gu&s;t the minds of the people.</P>
<P>IN the &s;tate in which things were through the greater part of Europe during the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and for &s;ome time both before and after that period, the con&s;titu|tion of the church of Rome may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formi|dable combination that ever was formed again&s;t the authority and &s;ecurity of civil government, as well as again&s;t the liberty, rea&s;on and happine&s;s of mankind, which can flouri&s;h only where civil government is able to protect them. In that con&s;titution the gro&s;&s;e&s;t delu&s;ions of &s;uper&s;tition were &s;upported in &s;uch a manner by
<PB N="394" REF="396">
the private intere&s;ts of &s;o great a number of people as put them out of all danger from any a&s;&s;ault of human rea&s;on: becau&s;e though human rea&s;on might perhaps have been able to unveil, even to the eyes of the common people, &s;ome of the delu&s;ions of &s;uper&s;tition; it could never have di&s;&s;olved the ties of private intere&s;t. Had this con&s;titution been attacked by no other enemies but the feeble efforts of human rea&s;on, it mu&s;t have endured forever. But that immen&s;e and well built fabric, which all the wi&s;dom and virtue of man could never have &s;haken, much le&s;s have over-turned, was by the natural cour&s;e of things, fir&s;t weakened, afterwards in part de&s;troyed, and is now likely, in the cour&s;e of a few centuries more, perhaps to crumble into ruins altogether.</P>
<P>THE gradual improvements of arts, manufactures and com|merce, the &s;ame cau&s;es which de&s;troyed the power of the great barons, de&s;troyed in the &s;ame manner, through the greater part of Europe, the whole temporal power of the clergy. In the produce of arts, manufactures and commerce, the clergy, like the great barons, found &s;omething for which they could exchange their rude produce, and thereby di&s;covered the means of &s;pending their whole revenues upon their own per&s;ons, without giving any con&s;iderable &s;hare of them to other people. Their charity became gradually le&s;s exten&s;ive, their ho&s;pitality le&s;s liberal or le&s;s profu&s;e. Their retainers became con&s;equently le&s;s numerous, and by degrees dwindled away altogether. The clergy too, like the great barons, wi&s;hed to get a better rent from their landed e&s;tates, in order to &s;pend it, in the &s;ame manner, upon the gratification of their own private vanity and folly. But this increa&s;e of rent could be got only by granting lea&s;es to their tenants, who thereby became in a great mea&s;ure independent of them. The ties of intere&s;t, which bound the inferior ranks of people to the clergy, were in this man|ner gradually broken and di&s;&s;olved. They were even broken and
<PB N="395" REF="397">
di&s;&s;olved &s;ooner than tho&s;e which bound the &s;ame ranks of people to the great barons: becau&s;e the benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much &s;maller than the e&s;tates of the great barons, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of each benefice was much &s;ooner able to &s;pend the whole of its revenue upon his own per&s;on. During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in full vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the ab&s;olute command which they had once had over the great body of the people, was very much decayed. The power of the church was by that time very nearly reduced through the greater part of Europe to what aro&s;e from her &s;piritual authority; and even that &s;piritual authority was much weakened when it cea&s;ed to be &s;upported by the charity and ho&s;pitality of the clergy. The inferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order, as they had done before, as the comforters of their di&s;tre&s;s, and the relievers of their indigence. On the contrary, they were provoked and di&s;gu&s;ted by the vanity, luxury, and expence of the richer clergy, who appeared to &s;pend upon their own plea&s;ures what had always before been regarded as the patrimony of the poor.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation of things, the &s;overeigns in the different &s;tates of Europe endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had in the di&s;po&s;al of the great benefices of the church, by procuring to the deans and chapters of each dioce&s;e the re&s;tora|tion of their antient right of electing the bi&s;hop, and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the abbot. The re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of this antient order was the object of &s;everal &s;tatutes enacted in England during the cour&s;e of the fourteenth century, and of the pragmatic &s;anction e&s;tabli&s;hed in France in the fifteenth century. In order to render the election valid, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;overeign &s;hould both con&s;ent to it before-hand, and afterwards approve of
<PB N="396" REF="398">
the per&s;on elected; and though the election was &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to be free, he had, however, all the indirect means which his &s;ituation nece&s;&s;arily afforded him of influencing the clergy in his own domi|nions. Other regulations of a &s;imilar tendency were e&s;tabli&s;hed in other parts of Europe. But the power of the pope in the collation of the great benefices of the church &s;eems, before the reformation, to have been no where &s;o effectually and &s;o univer&s;ally re&s;trained as in France and England. The Concordat afterwards, in the &s;ixteenth century, gave to the kings of France the ab&s;olute right of pre&s;ent|ing to all the great and con&s;i&s;torial benefices of the Gallican church.</P>
<P>SINCE the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Pragmatic &s;anction and of the Concordat, the clergy of France have in general &s;hown le&s;s re&s;pect to the decrees of the papal court than the clergy of any other catholic country. In all the di&s;putes which their &s;overeign has had with the pope, they have almo&s;t con&s;tantly taken party with the former. This independency of the clergy of France upon the court of Rome, &s;eems to be principally founded upon the Pragmatic &s;anction and the Concordat. In the earlier periods of the monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted to the pope as tho&s;e of any other country. When Robert, the &s;econd Prince of the Capetian race, was mo&s;t unju&s;tly excommunicated by the court of Rome, his own &s;ervants, it is &s;aid, threw the victuals which came from his table to the dogs, and refu&s;ed to ta&s;te any thing them&s;elves which had been polluted by the contact of a per&s;on in his &s;ituation. They were taught to do &s;o, it may very &s;afely be pre|fumed, by the clergy of his own dominions.</P>
<P>THE claim of collatinig to the great benefices of the church, a claim in defence of which the court of Rome had frequently &s;haken and &s;ometimes overturned the thrones of &s;ome of the greate&s;t &s;ove|reigns
<PB N="397" REF="399">
in Chri&s;tendom, was in this manner either re&s;trained or modified, or given up altogether, in many different parts of Europe, even before the time of the reformation. As the clergy had now le&s;s influence over the people, &s;o the &s;tate had more influence over the clergy. The clergy therefore had both le&s;s power and le&s;s inclination to di&s;turb the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE authority of the church of Rome was in this &s;tate of declen|&s;ion when the di&s;putes which gave birth to the reformation began in Germany, and &s;oon &s;pread them&s;elves through every part of Europe. The new doctrines were every where received with a high degree of popular favour. They were propagated with all that enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal which commonly animates the &s;pirit of party when it attacks e&s;tabli&s;hed authority. The teachers of tho&s;e doctrines, though perhaps in other re&s;pects not more learned than many of the divines who defended the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, &s;eem in general to have been better acquainted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, and with the origin and progre&s;s of that &s;y&s;tem of opinions upon which the authority of the church was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and they had thereby &s;ome advantage in almo&s;t every di&s;pute. The au&s;terity of their manners gave them authority with the common people, who contra&s;ted the &s;trict regula|rity of their conduct with the di&s;orderly lives of the greater part of their own clergy. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too in a much higher degree than their adver&s;aries, all the arts of popularity and of gaining pro&s;e|lytes, arts which the lofty and dignified &s;ons of the church had long neglected, as being to them in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s. The rea&s;on of the new doctrines recommended them to &s;ome, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy to a &s;till greater number; but the zealous, pa&s;&s;ionate and fanatical, though frequently coar&s;e and ru&s;tic eloquence with which they were almo&s;t every where inculcated, recommended them to by far the greate&s;t number.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="400">
THE &s;ucce&s;s of the new doctrines was almo&s;t every where &s;o great, that the princes who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of Rome, were by means of them ea&s;ily enabled, in their own dominions, to over-turn the church, which having lo&s;t the re&s;pect and veneration of the inferior ranks of people, could make &s;carce any re&s;i&s;tance. The court of Rome had di&s;obliged &s;ome of the &s;maller princes in the northern parts of Germany, whom it had probably con&s;idered as too in&s;ignificant to be worth the managing. They univer&s;ally, therefore, e&s;tabli&s;hed the reformation in their own dominions. The tyranny of Chri&s;|tiern II. and of Troll archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al, enabled Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a to expel them both from Sweden. The pope favoured the tyrant and the archbi&s;hop, and Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a found no difficulty in e&s;tabli&s;hing the reformation in Sweden. Chri&s;tiern II. was afterwards depo&s;ed from the throne of Denmark, where his con|duct had rendered him as odious as in Sweden. The pope, however, was &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to favour him, and Frederic of Hol|&s;tein, who had mounted the throne in his &s;tead, revenged him&s;elf by following the example of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a. The magi&s;trates of Berne and Zurich, who had no particular quarrel with the pope, e&s;tabli&s;hed with great ea&s;e the reformation in their re&s;pective cantons, where ju&s;t before &s;ome of the clergy had, by an impo&s;ture &s;omewhat gro&s;&s;er than ordinary, rendered the whole order both odious and contemptible.</P>
<P>IN this critical &s;ituation of its affairs the papal court was at &s;ufficient pains to cultivate the friend&s;hip of the powerful &s;ove|reigns of France and Spain, of whom the latter was at that time emperor of Germany. With their a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was enabled, though not without great difficulty and much blood&s;hed, either to &s;uppre&s;s altogether or to ob&s;truct very much the progre&s;s of the reformation in their dominions. It was well enough inclined too to be complai&s;ant to the king of England. But from the circum|&s;tances
<PB N="399" REF="401">
of the times it could not be &s;o without giving offence to a &s;till greater &s;overeign, Charles V. king of Spain and emperor of Germany. Henry VIII. accordingly, though he did not embrace him&s;elf the greater part of the doctrines of the reformation, was yet enabled, by the general prevalence of tho&s;e doctrines, to &s;up|pre&s;s all the mona&s;teries, and to aboli&s;h the authority of the church of Rome in his dominions. That he &s;hould go &s;o far, though he went no further, gave &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the patrons of the reformation, who having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government in the reign of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, completed without any dif|ficulty the work which Henry VIII. had begun.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak, unpopular, and not very firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the reforma|tion was &s;trong enough to overturn, not only the church, but the &s;tate likewi&s;e for attempting to &s;upport the church.</P>
<P>AMONG the followers of the reformation, di&s;per&s;ed in all the different countries of Europe, there was no general tribunal which, like that of the court of Rome, or an oecumenical coun|cil, could &s;ettle all di&s;putes among them, and with irre&s;i&s;table authority pre&s;cribe to all of them the preci&s;e limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the reformation in one country, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as they had no common judge to appeal to, the di&s;pute could never be decided; and many &s;uch di&s;putes aro&s;e among them. Tho&s;e concerning the government of the church, and the right of conferring eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices, were perhaps the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to the peace and welfare of civil &s;ociety. They gave birth accordingly to the two principal parties or &s;ects among the followers of the refor|mation, the Lutheran and Calvini&s;tic &s;ects, the only &s;ects among them, of which the doctrine and di&s;cipline have ever yet been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in any part of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="402">
THE followers of Luther, together with what is called the church of England, pre&s;erved more or le&s;s of the epi&s;copal go|vernment, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ubordination among the clergy, gave the &s;overeign the di&s;po&s;al of all the bi&s;hopricks, and other con&s;i&s;torial benefices within his dominions, and thereby rendered him the real head of the church; and without depriving the bi&s;hop of the right of collating to the &s;maller benefices within his dioce&s;e, they, even to tho&s;e benefices, not only admitted, but favoured the right of pre&s;entation both in the &s;overeign and in all other lay-patrons. This &s;y&s;tem of church government was from the beginning favourable to peace and good order, and to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the civil &s;overeign. It has never accordingly been the occa&s;ion of any tumult or civil commotion in any country in which it has once been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The church of England in particular has always valued her&s;elf, with great rea&s;on, upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her principles. Under &s;uch a govern|ment the clergy naturally endeavour to recommend them&s;elves to the &s;overeign, to the court, and to the nobility and gentry of the country, by who&s;e influence they chiefly expect to obtain preferment. They pay court to tho&s;e patrons, &s;ometimes, no doubt, by the vile&s;t flattery and a&s;&s;entation, but frequently too by cultivating all tho&s;e arts which be&s;t de&s;erve, and which are therefore mo&s;t likely to gain them the e&s;teem of people of rank and fortune; by their knowledge in all the different branches of u&s;eful and ornamental learning, by the decent liberality of their manners, by the &s;ocial good humour of their conver&s;ation, and by their avowed contempt of tho&s;e ab&s;urd and hypocritical au&s;terities which fanatics inculcate and pretend to practi&s;e, in order to draw upon them&s;elves the veneration, and upon the greater part of men of rank and fortune, who avow that they do not practi&s;e them, the abhorrence of the common people. Such a clergy, however, while they pay their court in this manner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect altogether the means of maintaining
<PB N="401" REF="403">
their influence and authority with the lower. They are li&s;tened to, e&s;teemed and re&s;pected by their &s;uperiors; but before their inferiors they are frequently incapable of defending, effectually and to the conviction of &s;uch hearers, their own &s;ober and mo|derate doctrines again&s;t the mo&s;t ignorant enthu&s;ia&s;t who chu&s;es to attack them.</P>
<P>THE followers of Zuinglius, or more properly tho&s;e of Calvin, on the contrary, be&s;towed upon the people of each pari&s;h, whenever the church became vacant, the right of electing their own pa&s;tor; and e&s;tabli&s;hed at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t perfect equality among the clergy. The former part of this in&s;titution, as long as it remained in vigour, &s;eems to have been productive of nothing but di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and to have tended equally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people. The latter part &s;eems never to have had any effects but what were perfectly agreeable.</P>
<P>AS long as the people of each pari&s;h pre&s;erved the right of electing their own pa&s;tors, they acted almo&s;t always under the influence of the clergy, and generally of the mo&s;t factious and fanatical of the order. The clergy, in order to pre&s;erve their influence in tho&s;e popular elections, became, or affected to become many of them, fanatics them&s;elves, encouraged fanatici&s;m among the people, and gave the preference almo&s;t always to the mo&s;t fanatical candidate. So &s;mall a matter as the appointment of a pari&s;h prie&s;t occa&s;ioned almo&s;t always a violent conte&s;t, not only in one pari&s;h, but in all the neighbouring pari&s;hes, who &s;eldom failed to take party in the quarrel. When the pari&s;h happened to be &s;ituated in a great city, it divided all the inhabitants into two parties; and when that city happened either to con&s;titute it&s;elf a little republic, or to be the head and capital of a little republic, as is the ca&s;e with many of the con&s;iderable cities in Switzerland and Holland, every paltry di&s;pute of this kind, over and above
<PB N="402" REF="404">
exa&s;perating the animo&s;ity of all their other factions, threatened to leave behind it both a new &s;chi&s;m in the church, and a new faction in the &s;tate. In tho&s;e &s;mall republics, therefore, the magi&s;trate very &s;oon found it nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving the public peace, to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the right of pre&s;enting to all vacant benefices. In Scotland, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive country in which this pre&s;byterian form of church government has ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed, the rights of patronage were in effect aboli&s;hed by the act which e&s;tabli&s;hed pre&s;bytery in the beginning of the reign of William III. That act at lea&s;t put it in the power of certain cla&s;&s;es of people in each pari&s;h to purcha&s;e for a very &s;mall price the right of electing their own pa&s;tor. The con&s;titution which this act e&s;tabli&s;hed was allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for about two and twenty years, but was aboli&s;hed by the 10th of queen Ann, ch. 12. on account of the confu&s;ions and di&s;orders which this more popular mode of election had almo&s;t every where occa&s;ioned. In &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a country as Scotland, however, a tumult in a remote pari&s;h was not &s;o likely to give di&s;turbance to government, as in a &s;maller &s;tate. The 10th of queen Ann re&s;tored the rights of patronage. But though in Scotland the law gives the benefice without any exception to the per&s;on pre&s;ented by the patron; yet the church requires &s;ometimes (for &s;he has not in this re&s;pect been very uniform in her deci&s;ions) a certain concurrence of the peo|ple, before &s;he will confer upon the pre&s;entee what is called the cure of &s;ouls, or the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction in the pari&s;h. She &s;ometimes at lea&s;t, from an affected concern for the peace of the pa|ri&s;h, delays the &s;ettlement till this concurrence can be procured. The private tampering of &s;ome of the neighbouring clergy, &s;ometimes to procure, but more frequently to prevent this concurrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate in order to enable them upon &s;uch occa&s;ions to tamper more effectually, are perhaps the cau&s;es which principally keep up whatever remains of the old fanatical &s;pirit, either in the clergy or in the people of Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="405">
THE equality which the pre&s;byterian form of church govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hes among the clergy, con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, in the equality of authority or eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; and, &s;econdly, in the equality of benefice. In all pre&s;byterian churches the equality of authority is perfect: that of benefice is not &s;o. The difference however, between one benefice and another, is &s;eldom &s;o con&s;i|derable as commonly to tempt the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or even of the &s;mall benefice to pay court to his patron, by the vile arts of flattery and a&s;&s;entation, in order to get a better. In all the pre&s;byterian churches, where the rights of patronage are thoroughly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, it is by nobler and better arts that the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy in general endeavour to gain the favour of their &s;uperiors; by their learning, by the irreproachable regularity of their life, and by the faithful and diligent di&s;charge of their duty. Their patrons even frequently complain of the independency of their &s;pirit, which they are apt to con&s;true into ingratitude for pa&s;t favours, but which at wor&s;t perhaps is &s;eldom any more than that indiffer|ence which naturally ari&s;es from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that no further favours of the kind are ever to be expected. There is &s;carce perhaps to be found any where in Europe a more learned, de|cent, independent, and re&s;pectable &s;et of men, than the greater part of the pre&s;byterian clergy of Holland, Geneva, Switzer|land, and Scotland.</P>
<P>WHERE the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be very great, and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may no doubt be carried too far, has, however, &s;ome very agreeable effects. Nothing but the mo&s;t exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of &s;mall fortune. The vices of levity and vanity nece&s;&s;arily render him ridiculous, and are, be&s;ides, almo&s;t as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his own conduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that &s;y&s;tem of morals which the common people re&s;pect the mo&s;t. He gains their e&s;teem
<PB N="404" REF="406">
and affection by that plan of life which his own intere&s;t and &s;itua|tion would lead him to follow. The common people look upon him with that kindne&s;s with which we naturally regard one who approaches &s;omewhat to our own condition, but who, we think, ought to be in a higher. Their kindne&s;s naturally provokes his kindne&s;s. He becomes careful to in&s;truct them, and attentive to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve them. He does not even de&s;pi&s;e the prejudices of people who are di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;o favourable to him, and never treats them with tho&s;e contemptuous and arrogant airs which we &s;o often meet with in the proud dignitaries of opulent and well|endowed churches. The pre&s;byterian clergy, accordingly, have more influence over the minds of the common people than per|haps the clergy of any other e&s;tabli&s;hed church. It is accordingly in pre&s;byterian countries only that we ever find the common people converted, without per&s;ecution, completely, and almo&s;t to a man, to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>IN countries where church benefices are the greater part of them very moderate, a chair in a univer&s;ity is generally a better e&s;tabli&s;h|ment than a church benefice. The univer&s;ities have, in this ca&s;e, the picking and chu&s;ing of their members from all the churchmen of the country, who, in every country, con&s;titute by far the mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s of men of letters. Where church benefices, on the contrary, are many of them very con&s;iderable, the church natu|rally draws from the univer&s;ities the greater part of their eminent men of letters; who generally find &s;ome patron who does him&s;elf honour by procuring them church preferment. In the former &s;itua|tion we are likely to find the univer&s;ities filled with the mo&s;t emi|nent men of letters that are to be found in the country. In the lat|ter we are likely to find few eminent men among them, and tho&s;e few among the younge&s;t members of the &s;ociety, who are likely too to be drained away from it before they can have acquired expe|rience
<PB N="405" REF="407">
and knowledge enough to be of much u&s;e to it. It is ob|&s;erved by Mr. de Voltaire that father Porr&eacute;e, a je&s;uit of no great eminence in the republic of letters, was the only profe&s;&s;or they had ever had in France who&s;e works were worth the reading. In a country which has produced &s;o many eminent men of letters, it mu&s;t appear &s;omewhat &s;ingular that &s;carce one of them &s;hould have been a profe&s;&s;or in a univer&s;ity. The famous Ga&s;&s;endi was, in the beginning of his life, a profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Aix. Upon the fir&s;t dawning of his genius it was repre&s;ented to him that by going into the church he could ea&s;ily find a much more quiet and comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as well as a better &s;ituation for pur&s;uing his &s;tudies; and he immediately followed the advice. The ob&s;ervation of Mr. de Voltaire may be applied, I believe, not only to France, but to all other Roman catholic countries. We very rarely find, in any of them, an eminent man of letters who is a profe&s;&s;or in a univer&s;ity, except, perhaps, in the profe&s;&s;ions of law and phy&s;ic; profe&s;&s;ions from which the church is not &s;o likely to draw them. After the church of Rome, that of England, is by far the riche&s;t and be&s;t endowed church in Chri&s;tendom. In Eng|land, accordingly, the church is continually draining the univer&s;ities of all their be&s;t and able&s;t members; and an old college tutor, who is known and di&s;tingui&s;hed in Europe as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to be found there as in any Roman catholic country. In Geneva, on the contrary, in the prote&s;tant cantons of Switzerland, in the prote&s;tant countries of Germany, in Hol|land, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the mo&s;t eminent men of letters whom tho&s;e countries have produced, have, not all indeed, but the far greater part of them, been profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities. In tho&s;e countries the univer&s;ities are continually draining the church of all its mo&s;t eminent men of letters.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be worth while to remark, that, if we except the poets, a few orators, and a few hi&s;torians, the far greater part
<PB N="406" REF="408">
of the other eminent men of letters, both of Greece and Rome, appear to have been either public or private teachers; generally either of philo&s;ophy or of rhetoric. This remark will be found to hold true from the days of Ly&s;ias and I&s;ocrates, of Plato and Ari&s;totle, down to tho&s;e of Plutarch and Epictetus, of Suetonius and Quintilian. Several of tho&s;e whom we do not know with certainty to have been public teachers, appear to have been private tutors. Polybius, we know, was private tutor to Scipio Aemilia|nus. Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, there are &s;ome probable rea&s;ons for believing, was &s;o to the children of Marcus and Quintus Cicero. To impo&s;e upon any man the nece&s;&s;ity of teaching, year after year, any particular branch of &s;cience, &s;eems, in reality, to be the mo&s;t effectual method for rendering him completely ma&s;ter of it him|&s;elf. By being obliged to go every year over the &s;ame ground, if he is good for any thing, he nece&s;&s;arily becomes, in a few years, well acquainted with every part of it: and if upon any particular point he &s;hould form too ha&s;ty an opinion one year, when he comes in the cour&s;e of his lectures to re-con&s;ider the &s;ame &s;ubject the year thereafter, he is very likely to correct it. As to be a teacher of &s;cience is certainly the natural employment of a mere man of let|ters; &s;o is it likewi&s;e, perhaps, the education which is mo&s;t likely to render him a man of &s;olid learning and knowledge. The medio|crity of church benefices naturally tends to draw the greater part of men of letters, in the country where it takes place, to the employment in which they can be the mo&s;t u&s;eful to the public, and, at the &s;ame time, to give them the be&s;t education, perhaps, they are capable of receiving. It tends to render their learning both as &s;olid as po&s;&s;ible, and as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE revenue of every e&s;tabli&s;hed church, &s;uch parts of it ex|cepted as may ari&s;e from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to be ob&s;erved, of the general revenue of the &s;tate, which
<PB N="407" REF="409">
is thus diverted to a purpo&s;e very different from the defence of the &s;tate. The tythe, for example, is a real land-tax, which puts it out of the power of the proprietors of land to contribute &s;o largely towards the defence of the &s;tate as they otherwi&s;e might be able to do. The rent of land, however, is, according to &s;ome, the &s;ole fund, and, according to others, the principal fund, from which, in all great monarchies, the exigencies of the &s;tate mu&s;t be ultimately &s;upplied. The more of this fund that is given to the church, the le&s;s, it is evident, can be &s;pared to the &s;tate. It may be laid down as a certain maxim, that, all other things being &s;uppo&s;ed equal, the richer the church, the poorer mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, either the &s;ove|reign on the one hand, or the people on the other; and, in all ca&s;es, the le&s;s able mu&s;t the &s;tate be to defend it&s;elf. In &s;everal prote&s;tant countries, particularly in all the prote&s;tant cantons of Switzerland, the revenue which antiently belonged to the Roman catholic church, the tythes and church lands, has been found a fund &s;ufficient not only to afford competent &s;alaries to the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, but to defray, with little or no addition, all the other expences of the &s;tate. The magi&s;trates of the powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated out of the &s;avings from this fund a very large &s;um, &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to &s;everal millions, part of which is depo&s;ited in a public trea&s;ure, and part is placed at intere&s;t in what are called the public funds of the different indebted na|tions of Europe; chiefly in tho&s;e of France and Great Britain. What may be the amount of the whole expence which the church, either of Berne, or of any other prote&s;tant canton, co&s;ts the &s;tate, I do not pretend to know. By a very exact account it appears, that, in 1755, the whole revenue of the clergy of the church of Scotland, including their glebe or church lands, and the rent of their man&s;es or dwelling hou&s;es, e&s;timated according to a rea&s;onable valuation amounted only to 68,5141. 1s. 5d. 1/12. This very mode|rate revenue affords a decent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to nine hundred and forty|four
<PB N="408" REF="410">
mini&s;ters. The whole expense of the church, including what is occa&s;ionally laid out for the building and reparation of churches, and of the man&s;es of mini&s;ters, cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed eighty or eighty-five thou&s;and pounds a year. The mo&s;t opulent church in Chri&s;tendom does not maintain better the uni|formity of faith, the fervour of devotion, the &s;pirit of order, regu|larity, and au&s;tere morals in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed church of Scotland. All the good effects, both civil and religious, which an e&s;tabli&s;hed church can be &s;up|po&s;ed to produce, are produced by it as completely as by any other. The greater part of the prote&s;tant churches of Switzerland, which in general are not better endowed than the church of Scotland, produce tho&s;e effects in a &s;till higher degree. In the greater part of the prote&s;tant cantons, there is not a &s;ingle per&s;on to be found who does not pro&s;e&s;s him&s;elf to be of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. If he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be of any other, indeed, the law obliges him to leave the canton. But &s;o &s;evere, or rather indeed &s;o oppre&s;|&s;ive a law, could never have been executed in &s;uch free countries, had not the diligence of the clergy before-hand converted to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church the whole body of the people, with the excep|tion of, perhaps, a few individuals only. In &s;ome parts of Swit|zerland, accordingly, where, from the accidental union of a pro|te&s;tant and roman catholic country, the conver&s;ion has not been &s;o complete, both religions are not only tolerated, but e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P>THE proper performance of every &s;ervice &s;eems to require that its pay or recompence &s;hould be, as exactly as po&s;&s;ible, propor|tioned to the nature of the &s;ervice. If any &s;ervice is very much under-paid, it is very apt to &s;uffer by the meanne&s;s and incapacity of the greater part of tho&s;e who are employed in it. If it is very much over-paid, it is apt to &s;uffer, perhaps, &s;till more by their negligence and idlene&s;s. A man of a large revenue, whatever may

to his profe&s;&s;ion, thinks he ought to live like other men of large revenues; and to &s;pend a great part of his time in fe&s;tivity, in vanity, and in di&s;&s;ipation. But in a clergyman this train of life not only con&s;umes the time which ought to be employed in the duties of his function, but in the eyes of the common people de&s;troys almo&s;t entirely that &s;anctity of character which can alone enable him to perform tho&s;e duties with proper weight and authority.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE expence of defending the &s;ociety, and that of &s;upporting the dignity of the chief magi&s;trate, are both laid out for the general benefit of the whole &s;ociety. It is rea&s;onable, therefore, that they &s;hould be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety, all the different members contributing, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in proportion to their re&s;pective abilities.</P>
<P>THE expence of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice too may, no doubt, be con&s;idered as laid out for the benefit of the whole &s;ociety. There is no impropriety, therefore, in its being defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety. The per&s;ons, however, who give occa&s;ion to this expence are tho&s;e, who, by their inju&s;tice in one way or another, make it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek redre&s;s or protection from the courts of ju&s;tice. The per&s;ons again mo&s;t immediately bene|fited by this expence, are tho&s;e whom the courts of ju&s;tice either re&s;tore to their rights or maintain in their rights. The expence of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, therefore, may very properly be defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other or both of tho&s;e two different &s;ets of per&s;ons according as different occa&s;ions may require, that is, by the fees of court. It cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety, except for the conviction of tho&s;e criminals who have not them|&s;elves any e&s;tate or fund &s;ufficient for paying tho&s;e fees.</P>
<P>THOSE local or provincial expences of which the benefit is local or provincial (what is laid out, for example, upon the police of a parti|cular town or di&s;trict) ought to be defrayed by a local or provincial revenue, and ought to be no burden upon the general revenue of the &s;ociety. It is unju&s;t that the whole &s;ociety &s;hould contribute towards an expence of which the benefit is confined to a part of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="413">
THE expence of maintaining good roads and communications is, no doubt, beneficial to the whole &s;ociety, and may, therefore, without any inju&s;tice, be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety. This expence, however, is mo&s;t immediately and directly beneficial to tho&s;e who travel or carry goods from one place to another, and to tho&s;e who con&s;ume &s;uch goods. The turn|pike tolls in England, and the duties called peages in other coun|tries, lay it altogether upon tho&s;e two different &s;etts of people, and thereby di&s;charge the general revenue of the &s;ociety from a very con&s;iderable burden.</P>
<P>THE expence of the in&s;titutions for education and religious in&s;truction, is likewi&s;e, no doubt, beneficial to the whole &s;ociety, and may, therefore, without inju&s;tice, be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety. This expence, however, might perhaps with equal propriety, and even with &s;ome advantage, be defrayed altogether by tho&s;e who receive the immediate benefit of &s;uch education and in&s;truction, or by the voluntary contribution of tho&s;e who think they have occa&s;ion for either the one or the other.</P>
<P>WHEN the in&s;titutions or public works which are beneficial to the whole &s;ociety, either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained altogether by the contribution of &s;uch particular mem|bers of the &s;ociety as are mo&s;t immediately benefited by them, the deficiency mu&s;t in mo&s;t ca&s;es be made up by the general contribution of the whole &s;ociety. The general revenue of the &s;ociety, over and above defraying the expence of defending the &s;ociety and of &s;upporting the dignity of the chief magi&s;trate, mu&s;t make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of revenue. The &s;ources of this general or public revenue, I &s;hall endeavour to explain in the following chapter.</P>

<P>THE funds or &s;ources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the &s;overeign or commonwealth mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t either in &s;tock or in land.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign, like any other owner of &s;tock, may derive a revenue from it, either by employing it him&s;elf, or by lending it. His revenue is in the one ca&s;e, profit; in the other, intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE revenue of a Tartar or Arabian chief con&s;i&s;ts in profit. It ari&s;es principally from the milk and increa&s;e of his own herds and flocks, of which he him&s;elf &s;uper-intends the management, and is the principal &s;hepherd or herd&s;man of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this earlie&s;t and rude&s;t &s;tate of civil government
<PB N="413" REF="415">
only that profit has ever made the principal part of the public revenue of a monarchical &s;tate.</P>
<P>SMALL republics have &s;ometimes derived a con&s;iderable revenue from the profit of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburgh is &s;aid to do &s;o from the profits of a public wine cellar and apothe|caries &s;hop <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Memoires concernant les Droits &amp; Impo&s;itions en Europe: tome 1. page 73. This work was compiled by the order of the court for the u&s;e of a commi&s;&s;ion employed for &s;ome years pa&s;t in con&s;idering the proper means for reforming the finances of France. The account of the French taxes, which takes up three volumes in quarto, may be regarded as perfectly authentic. That of tho&s;e of other European nations was com|piled from &s;uch informations as the French mini&s;ters at the different courts could procure. It is much &s;horter, and probably not quite &s;o exact as that of the French taxes.</NOTE>. The &s;tate cannot be very great of which the &s;ove|reign has lei&s;ure to carry on the trade of a wine merchant or apo|thecary. The profit of a public bank has been a &s;ource of revenue to more con&s;iderable &s;tates. It has been &s;o not only to Hamburgh, but to Venice and Am&s;terdam. A revenue of this kind has even by &s;ome people been thought not below the attention of &s;o great an empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the ordinary dividend of the bank of England at five and a half per cent. and its capital at ten millions &s;even hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds, the neat annual profit, after paying the expence of manage|ment, mu&s;t amount, it is &s;aid, to five hundred and ninety-two thou&s;and nine hundred pounds. Government, it is pretended, could borrow this capital at three per cent, intere&s;t, and by taking the management of the bank into its own hands, might make a clear profit of two hundred and &s;ixty-nine thou&s;and five hundred pounds a year. The orderly, vigilant and par&s;imonious admini&s;tration of &s;uch ari&s;tocracies as tho&s;e of Venice and Am&s;terdam, is extremely proper, it appears from experience, for the management of a mer|cantile project of this kind. But whether &s;uch a government as that of England; which, whatever may be its virtues, has never
<PB N="414" REF="416">
been famous for good oeconomy, which in time of peace has gene|rally conducted it&s;elf with the &s;lothful and negligent profu&s;ion that is perhaps natural to monarchies; and in time of war has con|&s;tantly acted with all the thoughtle&s;s extravagance that democra|cies are apt to fall into; could be &s;afely tru&s;ted with the ma|nagement of &s;uch a project mu&s;t at lea&s;t be a good deal more doubtful.</P>
<P>THE po&s;t office is properly a mercantile project. The govern|ment advances the expence of e&s;tabli&s;hing the different offices, and of buying or hiring the nece&s;&s;ary hor&s;es or carriages, and is repaid with a large profit by the duties upon what is carried. It is perhaps the only mercantile project which has been &s;ucce&s;sfully managed by, I believe, every &s;ort of government. The capital to be advanced is not very con&s;iderable. There is no my&s;tery in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The returns are not only certain, but immediate.</P>
<P>PRINCES, however, have frequently engaged in many other mercantile projects, and have been willing, like private per&s;ons, to mend their fortunes by becoming adventurers in the common branches of trade. They have &s;carce ever &s;ucceeded. The pro|fu&s;ion with which the affairs of princes are always managed, renders it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould. The agents of a prince regard the wealth of their ma&s;ter as inexhau&s;tible; are carele&s;s at what price they buy; are carele&s;s at what price they &s;ell; are carele&s;s at what expence they tran&s;port his goods from one place to another. Tho&s;e agents frequently live with the profu|&s;ion of princes, and &s;ometimes too, in &s;pite of that profu&s;ion, and by a proper method of making up their accounts, acquire the fortunes of princes. It was thus, as we are told by Machiavel, that the agents of Lorenzo of Medicis, not a prince of mean abilities, carried on his trade. The republic of Florence was &s;everal times obliged to pay the debt into which their extrava|gance
<PB N="415" REF="417">
had involved him. He found it convenient, accordingly, to give up the bu&s;ine&s;s of merchant, the bu&s;ine&s;s to which his family had originally owed their fortune, and in the latter part of his life to employ both what remained of that fortune, and the revenue of the &s;tate of which he had the di&s;po&s;al, in projects and expences more &s;uitable to his &s;tation.</P>
<P>NO two characters &s;eem more incon&s;i&s;tent than tho&s;e of trader and &s;overeign. If the trading &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company renders them very bad &s;overeigns; the &s;pirit of &s;ove|reignty &s;eems to have rendered them equally bad traders. While they were traders only, they managed their trade &s;ucce&s;sfully, and were able to pay from their profits a moderate dividend to the proprietors of their &s;tock. Since they became &s;overeigns, with a revenue which, it is &s;aid, was originally more than three millions &s;terling, they have been obliged to beg the extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of government in order to avoid immediate bankruptcy. In their former &s;ituation, their &s;ervants in India con&s;idered them&s;elves as the clerks of merchants: In their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, tho&s;e &s;ervants con&s;ider them&s;elves as the mini&s;ters of &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>A STATE may &s;ometimes derive &s;ome part of its public revenue from the intere&s;t of money, as well as from the profits of &s;tock. If it has ama&s;&s;ed a trea&s;ure, it may lend a part of that trea&s;ure, either to foreign &s;tates, or to its own &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE canton of Berne derives a con&s;iderable revenue by lending a part of its trea&s;ure to foreign &s;tates, that is, by placing it in the public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, chiefly in tho&s;e of France and England. The &s;ecurity of this revenue mu&s;t depend, fir&s;t, upon the &s;ecurity of the funds in which it is placed, or upon the good faith of the government which has the management of them; and, &s;econdly, upon the certainty or pro|bability
<PB N="416" REF="418">
of the continuance of peace with the debtor nation. In the ca&s;e of a war, the very fir&s;t act of ho&s;tility, on the part of the debtor nation, might be the forfeiture of the funds of its creditor. This policy of lending money to foreign &s;tates is, &s;o far as I know, peculiar to the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>THE city of Hamburgh <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See id. ibid.</NOTE> has e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of public pawn|&s;hop, which lends money to the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate upon pledges at &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t. This pawn-&s;hop or Lombard, as it is called, affords a revenue, it is pretended, to the &s;tate of a hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns, which, at four and &s;ixpence the crown, amounts to 33,750 l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>THE government of Pen&s;ylvania, without ama&s;&s;ing any trea|&s;ure, invented a method of lending, not money indeed, but what is equivalent to money, to its &s;ubjects. By advancing to private people, at intere&s;t, and upon land &s;ecurity to double the value, paper bills of credit to be redeemed fifteen years after their date, and in the mean time made transferable from hand to hand like bank notes, and declared by act of a&s;&s;embly to be a legal tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the province to another, it rai&s;ed a moderate revenue, which went a con&s;iderable way towards defraying an annual expence of about 4500 l. the whole ordinary expence of that frugal and orderly government. The &s;ucce&s;s of an expedient of this kind mu&s;t have depended upon three different circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, upon the demand for &s;ome other in&s;trument of commerce, be&s;ides gold and &s;ilver money, or upon the demand for &s;uch a quantity of con&s;umable &s;tock as could not be had without &s;ending abroad the greater part of their gold and &s;ilver money, in order to purcha&s;e it; &s;econdly, upon the good credit of the government which made u&s;e of this expedient; and, thirdly, upon the moderation with
<PB N="417" REF="419">
which it was u&s;ed, the whole value of the paper bills of credit never exceeding that of the gold and &s;ilver money which would have been nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on their circulation had there been no paper bills of credit. The &s;ame expedient was upon different occa&s;ions adopted by &s;everal other American colonies; but, from want of this moderation, it produced, in the greater part of them, much more di&s;order than conveniency.</P>
<P>THE un&s;table and peri&s;hable nature of &s;tock and credit, how|ever, render them unfit to be tru&s;ted to as the principal funds of that &s;ure, &s;teady, and permanent revenue, which can alone give &s;ecurity and dignity to government. The government of no great nation, that was advanced beyond the &s;hepherd &s;tate, &s;eems ever to have derived the greater part of its public revenue from &s;uch &s;ources.</P>
<P>LAND is a fund of a more &s;table and permanent nature; and the rent of public lands, accordingly, has been the principal &s;ource of the public revenue of many a great nation that was much advanced beyond the &s;hepherd &s;tate. From the produce or rent of the public lands, the antient republics of Greece and Italy derived for a long time the greater part of that revenue which defrayed the nece&s;&s;ary expences of the commonwealth. The rent of the crown lands con&s;tituted for a long time the greater part of the revenue of the antient &s;overeigns of Europe.</P>
<P>WAR and the preparation for war, are the two circum&s;tances which in modern times occa&s;ion the greater part of the nece&s;&s;ary expence of all great &s;tates. But in the antient republics of Greece and Italy every citizen was a &s;oldier, who both &s;erved and prepared him&s;elf for &s;ervice at his own expence. Neither of tho&s;e two circum&s;tances, therefore, could occa&s;ion any very con&s;ider|able expence to the &s;tate. The rent of a very moderate landed
<PB N="418" REF="420">
e&s;tate might be fully &s;ufficient for defraying all the other nece&s;&s;ary expences of government.</P>
<P>IN the antient monarchies of Europe, the manners and cu&s;toms of the times &s;ufficiently prepared the great body of the people for war; and when they took the field they were, by the con|dition of their feudal tenures, to be maintained either at their own expence, or at that of their immediate lords, without bring|ing any new charge upon the &s;overeign. The other expences of government were, the greater part of them, very moderate. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, it has been &s;hown, in&s;tead of being a cau&s;e of expence, was a &s;ource of revenue. The labour of the country people for three days before and for three days after harve&s;t, was thought a fund &s;ufficient for making and maintain|ing all the bridges, highways, and other public works which the commerce of the country was &s;uppo&s;ed to require. In tho&s;e days the principal expence of the &s;overeign &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted in the maintenance of his own family and hou&s;hold. The officers of his hou&s;hold, accordingly, were then the great officers of &s;tate. The lord trea&s;urer received his rents. The lord &s;teward and lord chamberlain looked after the expence of his family. The care of his &s;tables was committed to the lord con&s;table and the lord mar&s;hal. His hou&s;es were all built in the form of ca&s;tles, and &s;eem to have been the principal fortre&s;&s;es which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The keepers of tho&s;e hou&s;es or ca&s;tles might be con|&s;idered as a &s;ort of military governors. They &s;eem to have been the only military officers whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to maintain in time of peace. In the&s;e circum&s;tances the rent of a great landed e&s;tate might, upon ordinary occa&s;ions, very well defray all the nece&s;&s;ary expences of government.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the greater part of the civilized mo|narchies of Europe, the rent of all the lands in the country,
<PB N="419" REF="421">
managed as they probably would be if they all belonged to one proprietor, would &s;carce perhaps amount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people even in peaceable times. The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for example, including not only what is nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the current expence of the year, but for paying the intere&s;t of the public debts, and for &s;ink|ing a part of the capital of tho&s;e debts, amounts to upwards of ten millions a year. But the land-tax, at four &s;hillings in the pound, falls &s;hort of two millions a year. This land-tax, as it is called, however, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be one-fifth, not only of the rent of all the land, but of that of all the hou&s;es, and of the intere&s;t of all the capital &s;tock of Great Britain, that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public, or employed as farming &s;tock in the cultivation of land. A very con&s;iderable part of the pro|duce of this tax ari&s;es from the rent of hou&s;es, and the intere&s;t of capital &s;tock. The land-tax of the city of London, for example, at four &s;hillings in the pound, amounts to 123,399 l. 6s. 7d. That of the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter, to 63,092 l. 1s. 5d. That of the palaces of Whitehall and St. James's, to 30,754 l. 6s. 3d. A certain proportion of the land-tax is in the &s;ame manner a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon all the other cities and towns corporate in the kingdom, and ari&s;es almo&s;t altogether either from the rent of hou&s;es or from what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the intere&s;t of trading and capital &s;tock. According to the e&s;timation, therefore, by which Great Britain is rated to the land-tax, the whole ma&s;s of revenue ari&s;ing from the rent of all the lands, from that of all the hou&s;es, and from the intere&s;t of all the capital &s;tock, that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public or employed in the cultivation of land, does not exceed ten millions &s;terling a year, the ordinary revenue which government levies upon the people even in peaceable times. The e&s;timation by which Great Britain is rated to the land-tax is, no doubt, taking the whole kingdom at an average, very much below the real value; though in &s;everal par|ticular
<PB N="420" REF="422">
counties and di&s;tricts it is &s;aid to be nearly equal to that value. The rent of the lands alone, exclu&s;ive of that of hou&s;es, and of the intere&s;t of &s;tock, has by many people been e&s;timated at twenty millions, an e&s;timation made in a great mea&s;ure at ran|dom, and which, I apprehend, is as likely to be above as below the truth. But if the lands of Great Britain, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their cultivation, do not afford a rent of more than twenty mil|lions a year, they could not well afford the half, mo&s;t probably not the fourth part of that rent, if they all belonged to a &s;ingle pro|prietor, and were put under the negligent, expen&s;ive, and oppre&s;|&s;ive management of his factors and agents. The crown lands of Great Britain do not at pre&s;ent afford the fourth part of the rent which could probably be drawn from them if they were the pro|perty of private per&s;ons. If the crown lands were more exten&s;ive, it is probable they would be &s;till wor&s;e managed.</P>
<P>THE revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is in proportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole annual produce of the land of every coun|try, if we except what is re&s;erved for &s;eed, is either annually con&s;umed by the great body of the people, or exchanged for &s;omething el&s;e that is con&s;umed by them. Whatever keeps down the produce of the land below what it would otherwi&s;e ri&s;e to, keeps down the revenue of the great body of the people &s;till more than it does that of the proprietors of land. The rent of land, that portion of the produce which belongs to the proprietors, is &s;carce any where in Great Britain &s;uppo&s;ed to be more than a third part of the whole produce. If the land, which in one &s;tate of cultivation affords a rent of ten millions &s;terling a year, would in another afford a rent of twenty millions; the rent being, in both ca&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ed a third part of the produce; the revenue of the proprietors would be le&s;s than it otherwi&s;e might be by ten millions a year only; but the revenue of the great body of the peo|ple
<PB N="421" REF="423">
would be le&s;s than it otherwi&s;e might be by thirty millions a year, deducting only what would be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;eed. The popu|lation of the country would be le&s;s by the number of people which thirty millions a year, deducting always the &s;eed, could maintain, according to the particular mode of living and expence which might take place in the different ranks of men among whom the remain|der was di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>THOUGH there is not at pre&s;ent, in Europe, any civilized &s;tate of any kind which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of lands which are the property of the &s;tate; yet, in all the great monarchies of Europe, there are &s;till many large tracts of land which belong to the crown. They are generally fore&s;t; and &s;ometimes fore&s;t where, after travelling &s;everal miles, you will &s;carce find a &s;ingle tree; a mere wa&s;te and lo&s;s of country in re&s;pect both of produce and population. In every great monarchy of Europe the &s;ale of the crown lands would produce a very large &s;um of money, which, if applied to the payment of the public debts, would deliver from mortgage a much greater revenue than any which tho&s;e lands have ever afforded to the crown. In coun|tries where lands, improved and cultivated very highly, and yielding at the time of &s;ale as great a rent as can ea&s;ily be got from them, commonly &s;ell at thirty years purcha&s;e; the unimproved, unculti|vated, and low-rented crown lands might well be expected to &s;ell at forty, fifty, or &s;ixty years purcha&s;e. The crown might imme|diately enjoy the revenue which this great price would redeem from mortgage. In the cour&s;e of a few years it would probably enjoy another revenue. When the crown lands had become private pro|perty, they would, in the cour&s;e of a few years, become well|improved and well-cultivated. The increa&s;e of their produce would increa&s;e the population of the country, by augmenting the revenue and con&s;umption of the people. But the revenue which the crown
<PB N="422" REF="424">
derives from the duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, would nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e with the revenue and con&s;umption of the people.</P>
<P>THE revenue which, in any civilized monarchy, the crown de|rives from the crown lands, though it appears to co&s;t nothing to individuals, in reality co&s;ts more to the &s;ociety than perhaps any other equal revenue which the crown enjoys. It would, in all ca&s;es, be for the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety to replace this revenue to the crown by &s;ome other equal revenue, and to divide the lands among the people, which could not well be done better, perhaps, than by expo&s;ing them to public &s;ale.</P>
<P>LANDS, for the purpo&s;es of plea&s;ure and magnificence, parks, gardens, public walks, &amp;c. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which are every where con&s;i|dered as cau&s;es of expense, not as &s;ources of revenue, &s;eem to be the only lands which, in a great and civilized monarchy, ought to belong to the crown.</P>
<P>PUBLIC &s;tock and public lands, therefore, the two &s;ources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the &s;overeign or common|wealth, being both improper and in&s;ufficient funds for defraying the nece&s;&s;ary expense of any great and civilized &s;tate; it remains that this expense mu&s;t, the greater part of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the people contributing a part of their own private revenue in order to make up a public revenue to the &s;overeign or common-wealth.</P>

<HEAD>Of Taxes.</HEAD>
<P>THE private revenue of individuals, it has been &s;hewn in the fir&s;t book of this inquiry, ari&s;es ultimately from three different &s;ources; Rent, Profit, and Wages. Every tax mu&s;t finally be paid
<PB N="423" REF="425">
from &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e three different &s;orts of revenue, or from all of them indifferently. I &s;hall endeavour to give the be&s;t account I can, fir&s;t, of tho&s;e taxes which, it is intended, &s;hould fall upon rent; &s;econdly, of tho&s;e which, it is intended, &s;hould fall upon profit; thirdly, of tho&s;e which, it is intended, &s;hould fall upon wages; and, fourthly, of tho&s;e which, it is intended, &s;hould fall indifferently upon all tho&s;e three different &s;ources of private revenue. The particular con&s;ideration of each of the&s;e four diffe|rent &s;orts of taxes will divide the &s;econd part of the pre&s;ent chap|ter into four articles, three of which will require &s;everal other &s;ub|divi&s;ions. Many of tho&s;e taxes, it will appear from the following review, are not finally paid from the fund or &s;ource of revenue upon which it was intended they &s;hould fall.</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the examination of particular taxes, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e the four following maxims with regard to taxes in general.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE &s;ubjects of every &s;tate ought to contribute towards the &s;upport of the government, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in proportion to their re&s;pective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they re&s;pectively enjoy under the protection of the &s;tate. The expence of government to the individuals of a great nation, is like the expence of management to the joint tenants of a great e&s;tate, who are all obliged to contribute in proportion to their re&s;pective intere&s;ts in the e&s;tate. In the ob&s;ervation or neglect of this maxim con&s;i&s;ts what is called the equality or inequality of taxation. Every tax, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved once for all, which falls finally upon one only of the three &s;orts of revenue above-men|tioned is nece&s;&s;arily unequal, in &s;o far as it does not affect the other two. In the following examination of different taxes I &s;hall &s;el|dom take much further notice of this &s;ort of inequality, but &s;hall,
<PB N="424" REF="426">
in mo&s;t ca&s;es, confine my ob&s;ervations to that inequality which is ocea&s;ioned by a particular tax falling unequally even upon that particular &s;ort of private revenue which is affected by it.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other per&s;on. Where it is other|wi&s;e, every per&s;on &s;ubject to the tax is put more or le&s;s in the power of the tax-gatherer, who can either aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor, or extort, by the terror of &s;uch aggrava|tion, &s;ome pre&s;ent or perqui&s;ite to him&s;elf. The uncertainty of taxation encourages the in&s;olence and favours the corruption of an order of men who are naturally unpopular, even where they are neither in&s;olent nor corrupt. The certainty of what each indivi|dual ought to pay is, in taxation, a matter of &s;o great importance, that a very con&s;iderable degree of inequality, it appears, I believe, from the experience of all nations, is not near &s;o great an evil as a very &s;mall degree of uncertainty.</P>
<P N="3">III. EVERY tax ought to be levied at the time, or in the manner in which it is mo&s;t likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it. A tax upon the rent of land or of hou&s;es, payable at the &s;ame term at which &s;uch rents are u&s;ually paid, is levied at the time when it is mo&s;t likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay; or, when he is mo&s;t likely to have wherewithal to pay. Taxes upon &s;uch con&s;umable goods as are articles of luxury, are all finally paid by the con&s;umer, and generally in a manner that is very con|venient for him. He pays them by little and little, as he has occa&s;ion to buy the goods. As he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he plea&s;es, it mu&s;t be his own fault if he ever &s;uffers any con&s;iderable inconveniency from &s;uch taxes.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="425" REF="427">
IV. EVERY tax ought to be &s;o contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as po&s;&s;ible, over and above what it brings into the public trea&s;ury of the &s;tate. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public trea&s;ury, in the four following ways. Fir&s;t, the levying of it may require a great number of officers, who&s;e &s;alaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax, and who&s;e perqui&s;ites may impo&s;e another addi|tional tax upon the people. Secondly, it may ob&s;truct the indu|&s;try of the people, and di&s;courage them from applying to certain branches of bu&s;ine&s;s which might give maintenance and employ|ment to great multitudes. While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus dimini&s;h, or perhaps de&s;troy &s;ome of the funds, which might enable them more ea&s;ily to do &s;o. Thirdly, by the forfei|tures and other penalties which tho&s;e unfortunate individuals incur who attempt un&s;ucce&s;sfully to evade the tax, it may fre|quently ruin them, and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have received from the employment of their capitals. An injudicious tax offers a great temptation to &s;mug|gling. But the penalties of &s;muggling mu&s;t ri&s;e in proportion to the temptation. The law, contrary to all the ordinary princi|ples of ju&s;tice, fir&s;t creates the temptation, and then puni&s;hes tho&s;e who yield to it; and it commonly enhances the puni&s;hment too in proportion to the very circum&s;tance which ought certainly to alleviate it, the temptation to commit the crime <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man, page 474. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. Fourthly, by &s;ubjecting the people to the frequent vi&s;its, and the odious exami|nation of the tax-gatherers, it may expo&s;e them to much unnece&s;|&s;ary trouble, vexation, and oppre&s;&s;ion; and though vexation is not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, expence, it is certainly equivalent to the expence at which every man would be willing to redeem him&s;elf from it. It is in &s;ome one or other of the&s;e four different ways that taxes are frequently &s;o much more burden&s;ome to the people than they are beneficial to the &s;overeign.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="428">
THE evident ju&s;tice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recommended them more or le&s;s to the attention of all nations. All nations have endeavoured, to the be&s;t of their judgement, to render their taxes as equal, as certain, as convenient to the contri|butor, both in the time and in the mode of payment, and, in proportion to the revenue which they brought to the prince, as little burden&s;ome to the people as they could contrive. The follow|ing &s;hort review of &s;ome of the principal taxes which have taken place in different ages and countries will &s;how that the endeavours of all nations have not in this re&s;pect been equally &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I. <HI>Taxes upon Rent. Taxes upon the Rent of Land.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A TAX upon the rent of land may either be impo&s;ed according to a certain canon, every di&s;trict being valued at a certain rent, which valuation is not afterwards to be altered; or it may be impo&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to vary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to ri&s;e or fall with the improvement or declen&s;ion of its cultivation.</P>
<P>A LAND tax which, like that of Great Britain, is impo&s;ed according to a certain invariable canon, though it &s;hould be equal at the time of its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, nece&s;&s;arily becomes unequal in proce&s;s of time according to the unequal degrees of improve|ment or neglect in the cultivation of the different parts of the country. In England, the valuation according to which the different counties and pari&s;hes were a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the land|tax by the 4th of William and Mary was very unequal even at its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. This tax, therefore, &s;o far offends again&s;t the fir&s;t of the four maxims above-mentioned. It is perfectly agreeable to the other three. It is perfectly certain. The time of payment for the tax, being the &s;ame as that for the rent, is as
<PB N="427" REF="429">
convenient as it can be to the contributor. Though the landlord is in all ca&s;es the real contributor, the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to allow it in the payment of the rent. This tax is levied by a much &s;maller number of officers than any other which affords nearly the &s;ame revenue. As the tax does not ri&s;e with the ri&s;e of the rent, the &s;overeign does not &s;hare in the profits of the landlord's improvements. The tax, therefore, does not di&s;courage tho&s;e improvements, nor keep down the produce of the land below what it would otherwi&s;e ri&s;e to. As it has no tendency to dimini&s;h the quantity, it can have none to rai&s;e the price of the produce. It does not ob&s;truct the indu&s;|try of the people. It &s;ubjects the landlord to no other inconve|niency be&s;ides the unavoidable one of paying the tax.</P>
<P>THE advantage, however, which the landlord has derived from the invariable con&s;tancy of the valuation by which all the lands of Great Britain are rated to the land-tax, has been principally owing to &s;ome circum&s;tances altogether extraneous to the nature of the tax.</P>
<P>IT has been owing in part to the great pro&s;perity of almo&s;t every part of the country, the rents of almo&s;t all the e&s;tates of Great Britain having, &s;ince the time when this valuation was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, been continually ri&s;ing, and &s;carce any of them having fallen. The land|lords, therefore, have almo&s;t all gained the difference between the tax which they would have paid, according to the pre&s;ent rent of their e&s;tates, and that which they actually pay according to the ancient valuation. Had the &s;tate of the country been different, had rents been gradually falling in con&s;equence of the declen&s;ion of cultiva|tion, the landlords would almo&s;t all have lo&s;t this difference. In the &s;tate of things which has happened to take place &s;ince the revo|lution, the con&s;tancy of the valuation has been advantageous to the landlord and hurtful to the &s;overeign. In a different &s;tate of things
<PB N="428" REF="430">
it might have been advantageous to the &s;overeign and hurtful to the landlord.</P>
<P>As the tax is made payable in money, &s;o the valuation of the land is expre&s;&s;ed in money. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this valuation the value of &s;ilver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in the &s;tandard of the coin either as to weight or finene&s;s. Had &s;ilver ri&s;en con&s;iderably in its value, as it &s;eems to have done in the cour&s;e of the two centuries which preceeded the di&s;covery of the mines of America, the con&s;tancy of the valuation might have proved very oppre&s;&s;ive to the landlord. Had &s;ilver fallen con&s;iderably in its value, as it certainly did for about a century at lea&s;t after the di&s;covery of tho&s;e mines, the &s;ame con&s;tancy of valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the revenue of the &s;overeign. Had any con&s;iderable alteration been made in the &s;tandard of the money, either by &s;inking the &s;ame quantity of &s;ilver to a lower denomination, or by rai&s;ing it to a higher; had an ounce of &s;ilver, for example, in&s;tead of being coined into five &s;hillings and twopence, been coined either into pieces which bore &s;o low a denomination as two &s;hillings and &s;even-pence, or into pieces which bore &s;o high a one as ten &s;hillings and fourpence, it would in the one ca&s;e have hurt the revenue of the proprietor, in the other that of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IN circum&s;tances, therefore, &s;omewhat different from tho&s;e which have actually taken place, this con&s;tancy of valuation might have been a very great inconveniency, either to the contributors, or to the commonwealth. In the cour&s;e of ages &s;uch circum&s;tances, how|ever, mu&s;t, at &s;ome time or other, happen. But though empires, like all the other works of men, have all hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at immortality. Every con&s;titution, there|fore, which it is meant &s;hould be as permanent as the empire it&s;elf, ought to be convenient, not in certain circum&s;tances only,
<PB N="429" REF="431">
but in all circum&s;tances; or ought to be &s;uited, not to tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which are tran&s;itory, occa&s;ional, or accidental, but to tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary and therefore always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A TAX upon the rent of land which varies with every variation of the rent, or which ri&s;es and falls according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation, is recommended by that &s;ect of men of letters in France, who call them&s;elves, the oeconomi&s;ts, as the mo&s;t equitable of all taxes. All taxes, they pretend, fall ultimately upon the rent of land, and ought therefore to be impo&s;ed equally upon the fund which mu&s;t finally pay them. That all taxes ought to fall as equally as po&s;&s;ible upon the fund which mu&s;t finally pay them, is certainly true. But without entering into the di&s;agree|able di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the metaphy&s;ical arguments by which they &s;up|port their very ingenious theory, it will &s;ufficiently appear from the following review, what are the taxes which fall finally upon the rent of the land, and what are tho&s;e which fall finally upon &s;ome other fund.</P>
<P>IN the Venetian territory all the arable lands which are given in lea&s;e to farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droits. p. 210,241.</NOTE>. The lea&s;es are recorded in a public regi&s;ter which is kept by the officers of revenue in each province or di&s;trict. When the proprietor cultivates his own lands, they are valued according to an equitable e&s;timation and he is allowed a deduction of one-fifth of the tax, &s;o that for &s;uch lands he pays only eight in&s;tead of ten per cent. of the &s;uppo&s;ed rent.</P>
<P>A LAND-TAX of this kind is certainly more equal than the land-tax of England. It might not perhaps be altogether &s;o certain, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the tax might frequently occa&s;ion a
<PB N="430" REF="432">
good deal more trouble to the landlord. It might too be a good deal more expen&s;ive in the levying.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, however, might perhaps be contrived as would in a great mea&s;ure both prevent this uncertainty and moderate this expence.</P>
<P>THE landlord and tenant, for example, might jointly be obliged to record their lea&s;e in a public regi&s;ter. Proper penalties might be enacted again&s;t concealing or mi&s;repre&s;enting any of the condi|tions; and if part of tho&s;e penalties was to be paid to either of the two parties who informed again&s;t and convicted the other of &s;uch concealment or mi&s;repre&s;entation, it would effectually deter them from combining together in order to defraud the public revenue. All the conditions of the lea&s;e might be &s;ufficiently known from &s;uch a record.</P>
<P>SOME landlords, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing the rent, take a fine for the renewal of the lea&s;e. This practice is in mo&s;t ca&s;es the expedient of a &s;pendthrift, who for a &s;um of ready money &s;ells a future reve|nue of much greater value. It is in mo&s;t ca&s;es, therefore, hurtful to the landlord. It is frequently hurtful to the tenant, and it is always hurtful to the community. It frequently takes from the tenant &s;o great a part of his capital, and thereby dimini&s;hes &s;o much his ability to cultivate the land, that he finds it more difficult to pay a &s;mall rent than it would otherwi&s;e have been to pay a great one. Whatever dimini&s;hes his ability to cultivate, nece&s;&s;arily keeps down below what it would otherwi&s;e have been the mo&s;t important part of the revenue of the community. By rendering the tax upon &s;uch fines a good deal heavier than upon the ordinary rent, this hurtful practice might be di&s;couraged to the no &s;mall advantage
<PB N="431" REF="433">
of all the different parties concerned, of the landlord, of the tenant, of the &s;overeign, and of the whole community.</P>
<P>SOME lea&s;es pre&s;cribe to the tenant a certain mode of cultivation, and a certain &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops during the whole continuance of the lea&s;e. This condition (which is generally the effect of the landlords conceit of his own &s;uperior knowledge, a conceit in mo&s;t ca&s;es very ill founded) ought always to be con&s;idered as an additional rent; as a rent in &s;ervice in&s;tead of a rent in money. In order to di&s;courage the practice, which is generally a fooli&s;h one, this &s;pecies of rent might be valued rather high, and con&s;equently taxed &s;omewhat higher than common money rents.</P>
<P>SOME landlords, in&s;tead of a rent in money, require a rent in kind, in corn, cattle, poultry, wine, oil, &amp;c. others again require a rent in &s;ervice. Such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial to the landlord. They either take more or keep more out of the pocket of the former than they put into that of the latter. In every country where they take place, the tenants are poor and beggarly, pretty much according to the degree in which they take place. By valuing, in the &s;ame manner, &s;uch rents rather high, and con&s;equently taxing them &s;omewhat higher than common money-rents, a practice which is hurtful to the whole community might perhaps be &s;ufficiently di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>WHEN the landlord cho&s;e to occupy him&s;elf a part of his own lands, the rent might be valued according to an equitable arbitra|tion of the farmers and landlords in the neighbourhood, and a moderate abatement of the tax might be granted to him in the &s;ame manner as in the Venetian territory; provided the rent of the lands which he occupied did not exceed a certain &s;um. It is of import|ance that the landlord &s;hould be encouraged to cultivate a part of
<PB N="432" REF="434">
his own land. His capital is generally greater than that of the tenant, and with le&s;s &s;kill he can frequently rai&s;e a greater pro|duce. The landlord can afford to try experiments, and is generally di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o. His un&s;ucce&s;sful experiments occa&s;ion only a moderate lo&s;s to him&s;elf. His &s;ucce&s;sful ones contribute to the improvement and better cultivation of the whole country. It might be of importance however, that the abatement of the tax &s;hould encourage him to cultivate to a certain extent only. If the landlords &s;hould the greater part of them be tempted to farm the whole of their own lands, the country, (in&s;tead of &s;ober and indu&s;trious tenants, who are bound by their own intere&s;t to cultivate as well as their capital and &s;kill will allow them) would be filled with idle and profligate bailiffs, who&s;e abu&s;ive management would &s;oon degrade the cultivation and reduce the annual produce of the land, to the diminution, not only of the revenue of their ma&s;ters, but of the mo&s;t important part of that of the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration might perhaps free a tax of this kind from any degree of uncertainty which could occa&s;ion either oppre&s;&s;ion or inconveniency to the contributor; and might at the &s;ame time &s;erve to introduce into the common management of land, &s;uch a plan or policy as might contribute a good deal to the general improvement and good cultivation of the country.</P>
<P>THE expence of levying a land-tax, which varied with every variation of the rent, would no doubt be &s;omewhat greater than that of levying one which was always rated according to a fixed valuation. Some additional expence would nece&s;&s;arily be in|curred both by the different regi&s;ter offices which it would be proper to e&s;tabli&s;h in the different di&s;tricts of the country, and by the different valuations which might occa&s;ionally be made of
<PB N="433" REF="435">
the lands which the proprietor cho&s;e to occupy him&s;elf. The expence of all this, however, might be very moderate, and much below what is incurred in the levying of many other taxes which afford a very incon&s;iderable revenue in compari&s;on of what might ea&s;ily be drawn from a tax of this kind.</P>
<P>THE di&s;couragement which a variable land-tax of this kind might give to the improvement of land &s;eems to be the mo&s;t im|portant objection which can be made to it. The landlord would certainly be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to improve when the &s;overeign, who contributed nothing to the expence, was to &s;hare in the profit of the improvement. Even this objection might perhaps be obviated by allowing the landlord, before he began his improvement, to a&s;certain, in conjunction with the officers of revenue, the actual value of his lands according to the equitable arbitration of a certain number of landlords and farmers in the neighbourhood equally cho&s;en by both parties; and by rating him according to this valuation for &s;uch a number of years, as might be fully &s;ufficient for his complete indemnification. To draw the attention of the &s;overeign towards the improvement of the land, from a regard to the increa&s;e of his own revenue, is one of the principal advantages propo&s;ed by this &s;pecies of land-tax. The term, there|fore, allowed for the indemnification of the landlord ought not to be a great deal longer than what was nece&s;&s;ary for that pur|po&s;e; le&s;t the remotene&s;s of the intere&s;t &s;hould di&s;courage too much this attention. It had better, however, be &s;omewhat too long than in any re&s;pect too &s;hort. No encitement to the atten|tion of the &s;overeign can ever counter-balance the &s;malle&s;t di&s;cou|ragement to that of the landlord. The attention of the &s;overeign can be at be&s;t but a very general and vague con&s;ideration of what is likely to contribute to the better cultivation of the greater part of his dominions. The attention of the landlord is a particular and minute con&s;ideration of what is likely to be the mo&s;t advan|tageous
<PB N="434" REF="436">
application of every inch of ground upon his e&s;tate. The principal attention of the &s;overeign ought to be to encourage, by every means in his power, the attention both of the landlord and of the farmer; by allowing both to pur&s;ue their own intere&s;t in their own way, and according to their own judgment; by giving to both the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity that they &s;hall enjoy the full recompence of their own indu&s;try; and by procuring to both the mo&s;t exten&s;ive market for every part of their produce in con&s;e|quence of e&s;tabli&s;hing the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;afe&s;t communications both by land and by water, through every part of his own dominions, as well as the mo&s;t unbounded freedom of exportation to the do|minions of all other princes.</P>
<P>IF by &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration a tax of this kind could be &s;o managed as to give, not only no di&s;couragement, but, on the contrary, &s;ome encouragement to the improvement of land, it does not appear likely to occa&s;ion any other inconveniency to the landlord, except always the unavoidable one of being obliged to pay the tax.</P>
<P>IN all the variations of the &s;tate of the &s;ociety, in the improve|ment and in the declen&s;ion of agriculture; in all the variations in the value of &s;ilver, and in all tho&s;e in the &s;tandard of the coin, a tax of this kind would, of its own accord and without any atten|tion of government, readily &s;uit it&s;elf to the actual &s;ituation of things, and would be equally ju&s;t and equitable in all tho&s;e dif|ferent changes. It would, therefore, be much more proper to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a perpetual and unalterable regulation, or as what is called a fundamental law of the common-wealth, than any tax which was always to be levied according to a certain valuation.</P>
<P>SOME &s;tates, in&s;tead of the &s;imple and obvious expedient of a regi&s;ter of lea&s;es, have had recour&s;e to the laborious and expen&s;ive

<P>IN the antient dominions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia the land-tax is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to an actual &s;urvey and valuation, which is reviewed and altered from time to time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, &amp;c. tome i. p. 114, 115, 116, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

IN the dominions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia the revenue of the church is taxed much higher than that of lay proprietors. The revenue of the church is, the greater part of it, a burden upon the rent of land. It &s;eldom happens that any part of it is applied towards the improvement of land; or is &s;o employed as to con|tribute in any re&s;pect towards increa&s;ing the revenue of the great body of the people. His Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty had probably, upon that account, thought it rea&s;onable that it &s;hould contribute a good deal more towards relieving the exigencies of the &s;tate. In &s;ome countries the lands of the church are exempted from all taxes. In others they are taxed more lightly than other lands. In the dutchy of Milan, the lands which the church po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before 1575, are rated to the tax at a third only of their value.</P>
<P>IN Sile&s;ia lands held by a noble tenure are taxed three per cent. higher than tho&s;e held by a ba&s;e tenure. The honours and pri|vileges of different kinds annexed to the former, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty had probably imagined, would &s;ufficiently compen&s;ate to the proprietor a &s;mall aggravation of the tax; while at the &s;ame time the humiliating inferiority of the latter would be in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated by being taxed &s;omewhat more lightly. In other countries the &s;y&s;tem of taxation, in&s;tead of alleviating, aggravates this inequality. In the dominions of the king of Sardinia, and in tho&s;e provinces of France which are &s;ubject to what is called the Real or predial taille, the tax falls alto|gether upon the lands held by a ba&s;e tenure. Tho&s;e held by a noble one are exempted.</P>
<P>A LAND-TAX a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to a general &s;urvey and valua|tion, how equal &s;oever it may be at fir&s;t, mu&s;t, in the cour&s;e of a very moderate period of time, become unequal. To prevent its becoming &s;o would require the continual and painful attention of government to all the variations in the &s;tate and produce of
<PB N="437" REF="439">
every different farm in the country. The governments of Pru&s;&s;ia, of Bohemia, of Sardinia, and of the dutchy of Milan, actually exert an attention of this kind; an attention &s;o un&s;uitable to the nature of government, that it is not likely to be of long conti|nuance, and which, if it is continued, will probably in the long|run occa&s;ion much more trouble and vexation than it can po&s;|&s;ibly bring relief to the contributors.</P>
<P>IN 1666, the generality of Montauban was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the Real or predial taille according, it is &s;aid, to a very exact &s;urvey and valuation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Id. tome ii. p. 139, &amp;c.</NOTE> By 1727, this a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment had become altogether unequal. In order to remedy this inconveniency, government has found no better expedient than to impo&s;e upon the whole generality an additional tax of a hundred and twenty thou&s;and livres. This additional tax is rated upon all the different di&s;tricts &s;ubject to the taille according to the old a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. But it is levied only upon tho&s;e which in the actual-&s;tate of things are by that a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment under-taxed, and it is applied to the relief of tho&s;e which by the &s;ame a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment are over-taxed. Two di&s;tricts, for example, one of which ought in the actual &s;tate of things to be taxed at nine hundred, the other at eleven hundred livres, are by the old a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment both taxed at a thou&s;and livres. Both the&s;e di&s;tricts are by the additional tax rated at eleven hundred livres each. But this additional tax is levied only upon the di&s;trict undercharged, and it is applied altogether to the relief of that over-charged, which con&s;equently pays only nine hundred livres. The government neither gains nor lo&s;es by the additional tax, which is applied altogether to remedy the inequalities ari&s;ing from the old a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. The application is pretty much regulated according to the di&s;cretion of the intendant of the generality, and mu&s;t, therefore, be in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary.</P>

<HEAD>Taxes which are proportioned, not to the Rent, but to the produce of Land.</HEAD>
<P>TAXES upon the produce of land are in reality taxes upon the rent; and though they may be originally advanced by the farmer, are finally paid by the landlord. When a certain portion of the produce is to be paid away for a tax, the farmer computes, as well as he can, what the value of this portion is, one year with another, likely to amount to, and he makes a proportionable abate|ment in the rent which he agrees to pay to the landlord. There is no farmer who does not compute beforehand what the church|tythe, which is a land-tax of this kind, is, one year with another, likely to amount to.</P>
<P>THE tythe, and every other land-tax of this kind, under the appearance of perfect equality, are very unequal taxes; a certain portion of the produce being, in different &s;ituations, equivalent to a very different portion of the rent. In &s;ome very rich lands the produce is &s;o great, that the one half of it is fully &s;ufficient to replace to the farmer his capital employed in cultivation, together with the ordinary profits of farming &s;tock in the neighbourhood. The other half, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, the value of the other half, he could afford to pay as rent to the landlord, if there was no tythe. But if a tenth of the produce is taken from him in the way of tythe, he mu&s;t require an abatement of the fifth part of this rent, otherwi&s;e he cannot get back his capital with the ordinary profit. In this ca&s;e the rent of the landlord, in&s;tead of amounting to a half, or five-tenths of the whole produce, will amount only to four-tenths of it. In poorer lands, on the con|trary, the produce is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;mall, and the expence of culti|vation &s;o great, that it requires four-fifths of the whole produce to replace to the farmer his capital with the ordinary profit. In this
<PB N="439" REF="441">
ca&s;e, though there was no tythe, the rent of the landlord could amount to no more than one-fifth or two-tenths of the whole produce. But if the farmer pays one-tenth of the produce in the way of tythe, he mu&s;t require an equal abatement of the rent of the landlord, which will thus be reduced to one-tenth only of the whole produce. Upon the rent of rich lands, the tythe may &s;ome|times be a tax of no more than one-fifth part, or four &s;hillings in the pound; whereas, upon that of poorer lands, it may &s;ometimes be a tax of one-half, or of ten &s;hillings in the pound.</P>
<P>THE tythe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, &s;o it is always a great di&s;couragement both to the improvements of the landlord and to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the mo&s;t important, which are generally the mo&s;t expen&s;ive improvements; nor the other to rai&s;e the mo&s;t valuable, which are generally too the mo&s;t expen&s;ive crops; when the church, which lays out no part of the expence, is to &s;hare &s;o very largely in the profit. The cultivation of madder was for a long time con|fined by the tythe to the United Provinces, which, being pre&s;byte|rian countries, and upon that account exempted from this de&s;tructive tax, enjoyed a &s;ort of monopoly of that u&s;eful dying drug again&s;t the re&s;t of Europe. The late attempts to introduce the culture of this plant into England, have been made only in con&s;equence of the &s;tatute which enacted that five &s;hillings an acre &s;hould be received in lieu of all manner of tythe upon madder.</P>
<P>AS through the greater part of Europe, the church, &s;o in many different countries of A&s;ia the &s;tate, is principally &s;upported by a land-tax, proportioned, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. In China, the principal revenue of the &s;overeign con&s;i&s;ts in a tenth part of the produce of all the lands of the empire. This tenth part, however, is e&s;timated &s;o very moderately, that, in many pro|vinces,
<PB N="440" REF="442">
it is &s;aid not to exceed a thirtieth part of the ordinary pro|duce. The land-tax or land rent which u&s;ed to be paid to the Mahometan government of Bengal, before that country fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company, is &s;aid to have amounted to about a fifth part of the produce. The land-tax of antient Egypt is &s;aid likewi&s;e to have amounted to a fifth part.</P>
<P>IN A&s;ia, this &s;ort of land-tax is &s;aid to intere&s;t the &s;overeign in the improvement and cultivation of land. The &s;overeigns of China, tho&s;e of Bengal while under the Mahometan government, and tho&s;e of antient Egypt, are &s;aid accordingly to have been ex|tremely attentive to the making and maintaining of good roads and navigable canals, in order to increa&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, both the quantity and value of every part of the produce of the land, by procuring to every part of it the mo&s;t exten&s;ive market which their own dominions could afford. The tythe of the church is divided into &s;uch &s;mall portions, that no one of its proprietors can have any intere&s;t of this kind. The par&s;on of a pari&s;h could never find his account in making a road or canal to a di&s;tant part of the country, in order to extend the market for the produce of his own particular pari&s;h. Such taxes, when de&s;tined for the main|tenance of the &s;tate, have &s;ome advantages which may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to balance their inconveniency. When de&s;tined for the maintenance of the church, they are attended with nothing but inconveniency.</P>
<P>TAXES upon the produce of land may be levied, either in kind; or, according to a certain valuation, in money.</P>
<P>THE par&s;on of a pari&s;h, or a gentleman of &s;mall fortune who lives upon his e&s;tate, may &s;ometimes, perhaps, find &s;ome advantage in receiving, the one his tythe, and the other his rent, in kind.
<PB N="441" REF="443">
The quantity to be collected, and the di&s;trict within which it is to be collected, are &s;o &s;mall, that they both can over&s;ee, with their own eyes, the collection and di&s;po&s;al of every part of what is due to them. A gentleman of great fortune, who lived in the capital, would be in danger of &s;uffering much by the neglect, and more by the fraud of his factors and agents, if the rents of an e&s;tate in a di&s;tant province were to be paid to him in this manner. The lo&s;s of the &s;overeign, from the abu&s;e and depredation of his tax-gather|ers, would nece&s;&s;arily be much greater. The &s;ervants of the mo&s;t carele&s;s private per&s;on are, perhaps, more under the eye of their ma&s;ter than tho&s;e of the mo&s;t careful prince; and a public reve|nue, which was paid in kind, would &s;uffer &s;o much from the mi&s;|management of the collectors, that a very &s;mall part of what was levied upon the people would ever arrive at the trea&s;ury of the prince. Some part of the public revenue of China, however, is &s;aid to be paid in this manner. The Mandarins and other tax|gatherers will, no doubt, find their advantage in continuing the practice of a payment which is &s;o much more liable to abu&s;e than any payment in money.</P>
<P>A TAX upon the produce of land which is levied in money, may be levied either according to a valuation which varies with all the variations of the market price; or according to a fixed valua|tion, a bu&s;hel of wheat, for example, being always valued at one and the &s;ame money price, whatever may be the &s;tate of the mar|ket. The produce of a tax levied in the former way, will vary only according to the variations in the real produce of the land, according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation. The pro|duce of a tax levied in the latter way will vary, not only accord|ing to the variations in the produce of the land, but according to both tho&s;e in the value of the precious metals, and tho&s;e in the quantity of tho&s;e metals which is at different times contained in
<PB N="442" REF="444">
coin of the &s;ame denomination. The produce of the former will always bear the &s;ame proportion to the value of the real produce of the land. The produce of the latter may, at different times, bear very different proportions to that value.</P>
<P>WHEN, in&s;tead either of a certain portion of the produce of land, or of the price of a certain portion, a certain &s;um of money is to be paid in full compen&s;ation for all tax or tythe; the tax becomes, in this ca&s;e, exactly of the &s;ame nature with the land-tax of England. It neither ri&s;es nor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor di&s;courages improvement. The tythe in the greater part of tho&s;e pari&s;hes which pay what is called a Modus in lieu of all other tythe, is a tax of this kind. During the Maho|metan government of Bengal, in&s;tead of the payment in kind of a fifth part of the produce, a modus, and, it is &s;aid, a very moderate one, was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the greater part of the di&s;tricts or zeminda|ries of the country. Some of the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India com|pany, under pretence of re&s;toring the public revenue to its proper value, have, in &s;ome provinces, exchanged this modus for a pay|ment in kind. Under their management this change is likely both to di&s;courage cultivation, and to give new opportunities for abu&s;e in the collection of the public revenue, which has fallen very much below what it was &s;aid to have been when it fir&s;t fell under the management of the company. The &s;ervants of the company may, perhaps, have profited by this change, but at the expence, it is pro|bable, both of their ma&s;ters and of the country.</P>

<HEAD>Taxes upon the Rent of Hou&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE rent of a hou&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two parts, of which the one may very properly be called the Building rent; the other is commonly called the Ground rent.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="445">
THE building rent is the intere&s;t or profit of the capital expended in building the hou&s;e. In order to put the trade of a builder upon a level with other trades, it is nece&s;&s;ary that this rent &s;hould be &s;uf|ficient, fir&s;t, to pay him the &s;ame intere&s;t which he would have got for his capital if he had lent it upon good &s;ecurity; and, &s;econdly, to keep the hou&s;e in con&s;tant repair, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, to replace, within a certain term of years, the capital which had been employed in building it. The building rent, or the ordinary profit of building, is, therefore, every where regu|lated by the ordinary intere&s;t of money. Where the market rate of intere&s;t is four per cent. the rent of a hou&s;e which, over and above paying the ground rent, affords &s;ix, or &s;ix and a half per cent. upon the whole expence of building, may perhaps afford a &s;ufficient profit to the builder. Where the market rate of intere&s;t is five per cent. it may perhaps require &s;even or &s;even and a half per cent. If, in proportion to the intere&s;t of money, the trade of the builder affords at any time a much greater profit than this, it will &s;oon draw &s;o much capital from other trades as will reduce the profit to its proper level. If it affords at any time much le&s;s than this, other trades will &s;oon draw &s;o much capital from it as will again rai&s;e that profit.</P>
<P>WHATEVER part of the whole rent of a hou&s;e is over and above what is &s;ufficient for affording this rea&s;onable profit, naturally goes to the ground-rent; and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the building are two different per&s;ons, is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, completely paid to the former. This &s;urplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the hou&s;e pays for &s;ome real or &s;uppo&s;ed advantage of the &s;ituation. In country hou&s;es, at a di&s;tance from any great town, where there is plenty of ground to chu&s;e upon; the ground rent is &s;carce any thing, or no more than what the ground which the hou&s;e &s;tands upon would pay if employed in
<PB N="444" REF="446">
agriculture. In country villas in the neighbourhood of &s;ome great town, it is &s;ometimes a good deal higher; and the peculiar conve|niency or beauty of &s;ituation is there frequently very well paid for. Ground rents are generally highe&s;t in the capital, and in tho&s;e par|ticular parts of it where there happens to be the greate&s;t demand for hou&s;es, whatever be the rea&s;on of that demand, whether for trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, for plea&s;ure and &s;ociety, or for mere vanity and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>A TAX upon hou&s;e-rent, payable by the tenant and proportioned to the whole rent of each hou&s;e, could not, for any con&s;iderable time at lea&s;t, affect the building rent. If the builder did not get his rea&s;onable profit, he would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by rai&s;ing the demand for building, would in a &s;hort time bring back his profit to its proper level with that of other trades. Neither would &s;uch a tax fall altogether upon the ground rent; but it would divide it&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to fall, partly upon the inhabitant of the hou&s;e, and partly upon the owner of the ground.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that a particular per&s;on judges that he can afford for hou&s;e-rent an expence of &s;ixty pounds a year; and let us &s;uppo&s;e too that a tax of four &s;hillings in the pound, or of one-fifth, payable by the inhabitant, is laid upon hou&s;e-rent. A hou&s;e of &s;ixty pounds rent will in this ca&s;e co&s;t him &s;eventy-two pounds a year, which is twelve pounds more than he thinks he can afford. He will, therefore, content him&s;elf with a wor&s;e hou&s;e, or a hou&s;e of fifty pounds rent, which, with the additional ten pounds that he mu&s;t pay for the tax, will make up the &s;um of &s;ixty pounds a year, the expence which he judges he can afford; and in order to pay the tax he will give up a part of the additional conveniency which he might have had from a hou&s;e of ten pounds a year more rent. He will give up, I &s;ay, a part of
<PB N="445" REF="447">
this additional conveniency; for he will &s;eldom be obliged to give up the whole, but will, in con&s;equence of the tax, get a better hou&s;e for fifty pounds a year, than he could have got if there had been no tax. For as a tax of this kind, by taking away this parti|cular competitor, mu&s;t dimini&s;h the competition for hou&s;es of &s;ixty pounds rent, &s;o it mu&s;t likewi&s;e dimini&s;h it for tho&s;e of fifty pounds rent, and in the &s;ame manner for tho&s;e of all other rents, except the lowe&s;t rent, for which it would for &s;ome time increa&s;e the com|petition. But the rents of every cla&s;s of hou&s;es for which the com|petition was dimini&s;hed, would nece&s;&s;arily be more or le&s;s reduced. As no part of this reduction, however, could, for any con&s;iderable time at lea&s;t, affect the building rent; the whole of it mu&s;t in the long-run nece&s;&s;arily fall upon the ground-rent. The final pay|ment of this tax, therefore, would fall, partly upon the inhabitant of the hou&s;e, who, in order to pay his &s;hare, would be obliged to give up a part of his conveniency; and partly upon the owner of the ground, who, in order to pay his &s;hare, would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what proportion this final payment would be divided between them, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to a&s;cer|tain. The divi&s;ion would probably be very different in different circum&s;tances, and a tax of this kind might, according to tho&s;e different circum&s;tances, affect very unequally both the inhabitant of the hou&s;e and the owner of the ground.</P>
<P>THE inequality with which a tax of this kind might fall upon the owners of different ground rents, would ari&s;e altogether from the accidental inequality of this divi&s;ion. But the inequality with which it might fall upon the inhabitants of different hou&s;es would ari&s;e, not only from this, but from another cau&s;e. The proportion of the expence of hou&s;e-rent to the whole expence of living, is different in the different degrees of fortune. It is perhaps highe&s;t in the highe&s;t degree, and it dimini&s;hes gradually through the infe|rior
<PB N="446" REF="448">
degrees, &s;o as in general to be lowe&s;t in the lowe&s;t degree. The nece&s;&s;aries of life occa&s;ion the great expence of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is &s;pent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occa&s;ion the principal expence of the rich; and a magnificent hou&s;e embelli&s;hes and &s;ets off to the be&s;t advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they po&s;&s;e&s;s. A tax upon hou&s;e-rents, therefore, would in general fall heavie&s;t upon the rich; and in this &s;ort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be any thing very unrea&s;onable. It is not very unrea&s;onable that the rich &s;hould contribute to the public expence, not only in proportion to their revenue, but &s;omething more than in that proportion.</P>
<P>THE rent of hou&s;es, though it in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;embles the rent of land, is in one re&s;pect e&s;&s;entially different from it. The rent of land is paid for the u&s;e of a productive &s;ubject. The land which pays it produces it. The rent of hou&s;es is paid for the u&s;e of an unproductive &s;ubject. Neither the hou&s;e nor the ground which it &s;tands upon produce any thing. The per&s;on who pays the rent, therefore, mu&s;t draw it from &s;ome other &s;ource of revenue, di&s;tinct from, and independent of, this &s;ubject. A tax upon the rent of hou&s;es, &s;o far as it falls upon the inhabitants, mu&s;t be drawn from the &s;ame &s;ource as the rent it&s;elf, and mu&s;t be paid from their revenue, whether derived from the wages of labour, the profits of &s;tock, or the rent of land. So far as it falls upon the inhabitants, it is one of tho&s;e taxes which fall, not upon one only, but indifferently upon all the three different &s;ources of reve|nue; and is in every re&s;pect of the &s;ame nature as a tax upon any other &s;ort of con&s;umable commodities. In general there is not, perhaps, any one article of expence or con&s;umption by which the liberality or narrowne&s;s of a man's whole expence can be better judged of, than by his hou&s;e-rent. A proportional tax upon
<PB N="447" REF="449">
this particular article of expence might, perhaps, produce a more con&s;iderable revenue than any which has hitherto been drawn from it in any part of Europe. If the tax indeed was very high, the greater part of people would endeavour to evade it as much as they could, by contenting them&s;elves with &s;maller hou&s;es, and by turning the greater part of their expence into &s;ome other channel.</P>
<P>THE rent of hou&s;es might ea&s;ily be a&s;certained with &s;ufficient accuracy, by a policy of the &s;ame kind with that which would be nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;certaining the ordinary rent of land. Hou&s;es not inhabited ought to pay no tax. A tax upon them would fall alto|gether upon the proprietor, who would thus be taxed for a &s;ubject which afforded him neither conveniency nor revenue. Hou&s;es inha|bited by the proprietor ought to be rated, not according to the expence which they might have co&s;t in building, but according to the rent which an equitable arbitration might judge them likely to bring, if lea&s;ed to a tenant. If rated according to the expence which they may have co&s;t in building, a tax of three or four &s;hil|lings in the pound, joined with other taxes, would ruin almo&s;t all the rich and great families of this, and, I believe, of every other civilized country. Whoever will examine, with attention, the dif|ferent town and country hou&s;es of &s;ome of the riche&s;t and greate&s;t families in this country, will find that, at the rate of only &s;ix and a half, or &s;even per cent. upon the original expence of building, their hou&s;e-rent is nearly equal to the whole neat rent of their e&s;tates. It is the accumulated expence of &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genera|tions, laid out upon objects of great beauty and magnificence, indeed; but, in proportion to what they co&s;t, of very &s;mall ex|changeable value.</P>
<P>GROUND-RENTS are a &s;till more proper &s;ubject of taxation than the rent of hou&s;es. A tax upon ground-rents would not
<PB N="448" REF="450">
rai&s;e the rents of hou&s;es. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopoli&s;t, and exacts the greate&s;t rent which can be got for the u&s;e of his ground. More or le&s;s can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a parti|cular &s;pot of ground at a greater or &s;maller expence. In every country the greate&s;t number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highe&s;t ground-rents are always to be found. As the wealth of tho&s;e competitors would in no re&s;pect be increa&s;ed by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be di&s;po&s;ed to pay more for the u&s;e of the ground. Whe|ther the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance. The more the inha|bitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the le&s;s he would incline to pay for the ground; &s;o that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent. The ground|rents of uninhabited hou&s;es ought to pay no tax.</P>
<P>BOTH ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a &s;pecies of revenue which the owner, in many ca&s;es, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue &s;hould be taken from him in order to defray the expences of the &s;tate, no di&s;couragement will thereby be given to any &s;ort of indu|&s;try. The annual produce of the land and labour of the &s;ociety, the real wealth and revenue of the great body of the people, might be the &s;ame after &s;uch a tax as before. Ground-rents, and the ordinary rent of land, are therefore, perhaps, the &s;pecies of reve|nue which can be&s;t bear to have a peculiar tax impo&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>GROUND-RENTS &s;eem, in this re&s;pect, a more proper &s;ubject of peculiar taxation than even the ordinary rent of land. The ordi|nary rent of land is, in many ca&s;es, owing partly at lea&s;t to the
<PB N="449" REF="451">
attention and good management of the landlord. A very heavy tax might di&s;courage too much this attention and good manage|ment. Ground-rents, &s;o far as they exceed the ordinary rent of land, are altogether owing to the good government of the &s;ove|reign, which, by protecting the indu&s;try either of the whole people, or of the inhabitants of &s;ome particular place, enables them to pay &s;o much more than its real value for the ground which they build their hou&s;es upon; or to make to its owner &s;o much more than compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s which he might &s;u&s;tain by this u&s;e of it. Nothing can be more rea&s;onable than that a fund which owes its exi&s;tence to the good government of the &s;tate, &s;hould be taxed peculiarly, or &s;hould contribute &s;omething more than the greater part of other funds towards the &s;upport of that govern|ment.</P>
<P>THOUGH, in many different countries of Europe, taxes have been impo&s;ed upon the rent of hou&s;es, I do not know of any in which ground-rents have been con&s;idered as a &s;eparate &s;ubject of taxation. The contrivers of taxes have, probably, found &s;ome difficulty in a&s;certaining what part of the rent ought to be con&s;i|dered as ground-rent, and what part ought to be con&s;idered as build|ing rent. It &s;hould not, however, &s;eem very difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e two parts of the rent from one another.</P>
<P>IN Great Britain the rent of hou&s;es is &s;uppo&s;ed to be taxed in the &s;ame proportion as the rent of land, by what is called the annual land tax. The valuation, according to which each different pari&s;h and di&s;trict is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to this tax, is always the &s;ame. It was ori|ginally extremely unequal, and it &s;till continues to be &s;o. Through the greater part of the kingdom this tax falls &s;till more lightly upon the rent of hou&s;es than upon that of land. In &s;ome few di&s;tricts only, which were originally rated high, and in which the
<PB N="450" REF="452">
rents of hou&s;es have fallen con&s;iderably, the land tax of three or four &s;hillings in the pound, is &s;aid to amount to an equal propor|tion of the real rent of the hou&s;es. Untenanted hou&s;es, though by law &s;ubject to the tax, are, in mo&s;t di&s;tricts, exempted from it by the favour of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and this exemption &s;ometimes occa&s;ions &s;ome little variation in the rate of particular hou&s;es, though that of the di&s;trict is always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN the province of Holland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memories concernant les Droits, &amp;c. p. 223.</NOTE> every hou&s;e is taxed at two and a half per cent. of its value, without any regard either to the rent which it actually pays, or to the circum&s;tance of its being tenanted or untenanted. There &s;eems to be a hard&s;hip in obliging the pro|prietor to pay a tax for an untenanted hou&s;e, from which he can derive no revenue; e&s;pecially &s;o very heavy a tax. In Holland, where the market rate of intere&s;t does not exceed three per cent. two and a half per cent. upon the whole value of the hou&s;e, mu&s;t, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, amount to more than a third of the building-rent, perhaps of the whole rent. The valuation, indeed, according to which the hou&s;es are rated, though very unequal, is &s;aid to be always below the real value. When a hou&s;e is rebuilt, improved, or enlarged, there is a new valuation, and the tax is rated accord|ingly.</P>
<P>THE contrivers of the &s;everal taxes which in England have, at diffe|rent times, been impo&s;ed upon hou&s;es, &s;eem to have imagined that there was &s;ome great difficulty in a&s;certaining, with tolerable exact|ne&s;s, what was the real rent of every hou&s;e. They have regulated their taxes, therefore, according to &s;ome more obvious circum|&s;tance, &s;uch as they had probably imagined would, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, bear &s;ome proportion to the rent.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t tax of this kind was hearth-money; or a tax of two &s;hillings upon every hearth. In order to a&s;certain how many
<PB N="451" REF="453">
hearths were in the hou&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the tax-gatherer &s;hould enter every room in it. This odious vi&s;it rendered the tax odious. Soon after the revolution, therefore, it was aboli&s;hed as a badge of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>THE next tax of this kind was, a tax of two &s;hillings upon every dwelling hou&s;e inhabited. A hou&s;e with ten windows to pay four &s;hillings more. A hou&s;e with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight &s;hillings. This tax was afterwards &s;o far altered, that hou&s;es with twenty windows, and with le&s;s than thirty, were ordered to pay ten &s;hillings, and tho&s;e with thirty windows and upwards to pay twenty &s;hillings. The number of windows can, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, be counted from the out&s;ide, and, in all ca&s;es, without entering every room in the hou&s;e. The vi&s;it of the tax-gatherer, therefore, was le&s;s offen&s;ive in this tax than in the hearth-money.</P>
<P>THIS tax was afterwards repealed, and in the room of it was e&s;tabli&s;hed the window tax, which has undergone too &s;everal alte|rations and augmentations. The window tax, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, (January, 1775) over and above the duty of three &s;hillings upon every hou&s;e in England, and of one &s;hilling upon every hou&s;e in Scotland, lays a duty upon every window, which, in England, aug|ments gradually from two-pence, the lowe&s;t rate, upon hou&s;es with not more than &s;even windows; to two &s;hillings, the highe&s;t rate, upon hou&s;es with twenty-five windows and upwards.</P>
<P>THE principal objection to all &s;uch taxes is their inequality, an inequality of the wor&s;t kind, as they mu&s;t frequently fall much hea|vier upon the poor than upon the rich. A hou&s;e of ten pounds rent in a country town may &s;ometimes have more windows than a hou&s;e of five hundred pounds rent in London; and though the inhabitant of the former is likely to be a much poorer man than that of the latter, yet &s;o far as his contribution is regulated by the
<PB N="452" REF="454">
window-tax, he mu&s;t contribute more to the &s;upport of the &s;tate. Such taxes are, therefore, directly contrary to the fir&s;t of the four maxims above mentioned. They do not &s;eem to offend much again&s;t any of the other three.</P>
<P>THE natural tendency of the window-tax, and of all other taxes upon hou&s;es, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the le&s;s, it is evident, he can afford to pay for the rent. Since the impo&s;ition of the window-tax, however, the rents of hou&s;es have upon the whole ri&s;en, more or le&s;s, in almo&s;t every town and village of Great Britain with which I am acquainted. Such has been almo&s;t every where the increa&s;e of the demand for hou&s;es, that it has rai&s;ed the rents more than the window-tax could &s;ink them; one of the many proofs of the great pro&s;pe|rity of the country, and of the increa&s;ing revenue of its inha|bitants. Had it not been for the tax, rents would probably have ri&s;en &s;till higher.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II. <HI>Taxes upon Profit, or upon the Revenue ari&s;ing from Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE revenue or profit ari&s;ing from &s;tock naturally divides it&s;elf into two parts; that which pays the intere&s;t, and which belongs to the owner of the &s;tock; and that &s;urplus part which is over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for paying the intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS latter part of profit is evidently a &s;ubject not taxable directly. It is the compen&s;ation, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es it is no more than a very moderate compen&s;ation, for the ri&s;k and trouble of employing the &s;tock. The employer mu&s;t have this compen|&s;ation, otherwi&s;e he cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with his own intere&s;t, continue the employment. If he was taxed directly, therefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would be obliged either to
<PB N="453" REF="455">
rai&s;e the rate of his profit, or to charge the tax upon the intere&s;t of money; that is, to pay le&s;s intere&s;t. If he rai&s;ed the rate of his profit in proportion to the tax, the whole tax, though it might be advanced by him, would be finally paid by one or other of two different &s;ets of people, according to the different ways in which he might employ the &s;tock of which he had the manage|ment. If he employed it as a farming &s;tock in the cultivation of land, he could rai&s;e the rate of his profit only by retaining a greater portion, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of a greater portion of the produce of the land; and as this could be done only by a reduction of rent, the final payment of the tax would fall upon the landlord. If he employed it as a mercantile or manufacturing &s;tock, he could rai&s;e the rate of his profit only by rai&s;ing the price of his goods; in which ca&s;e the final pay|ment of the tax would fall altogether upon the con&s;umers of tho&s;e goods. If he did not rai&s;e the rate of his profit, he would be obliged to charge the whole tax upon that part of it which was allotted for the intere&s;t of money. He could afford le&s;s intere&s;t for whatever &s;tock he borrowed, and the whole weight of the tax would in this ca&s;e fall ultimately upon the intere&s;t of money. So far as he could not relieve him&s;elf from the tax in the one way, he would be obliged to relieve him&s;elf in the other.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t of money &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight a &s;ubject equally capable of being taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land it is a neat produce which remains after completely compen&s;ating the whole ri&s;k and trouble of employing the &s;tock. As a tax upon the rent of land cannot rai&s;e rents; becau&s;e the neat produce which remains after replacing the &s;tock of the farmer, together with his rea&s;onable profit, cannot be greater after the tax than before it: &s;o, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, a tax upon
<PB N="454" REF="456">
the intere&s;t of money could not rai&s;e the rate of intere&s;t; the quantity of &s;tock or money in the country, like the quantity of land, being &s;uppo&s;ed to remain the &s;ame after the tax as before it. The ordinary rate of profit, it has been &s;hewn in the fir&s;t book, is every where regulated by the quantity of &s;tock to be employed in proportion to the quantity of the employment, or of the bu&s;ine&s;s which mu&s;t be done by it. But the quantity of the employment, or of the bu&s;ine&s;s to be done by &s;tock, could nei|ther be increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed by any tax upon the intere&s;t of money. If the quantity of the &s;tock to be employed, therefore, was neither increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed by it, the ordinary rate of profit would nece&s;&s;arily remain the &s;ame. But the portion of this profit nece&s;&s;ary for compen&s;ating the ri&s;k and trouble of the employer, would likewi&s;e remain the &s;ame; that ri&s;k and trouble being in no re&s;pect altered. The re&s;idue, therefore, that portion which belongs to the owner of the &s;tock, and which pays the intere&s;t of money, would nece&s;&s;arily remain the &s;ame too. At fir&s;t &s;ight, therefore, the intere&s;t of money &s;eems to be a &s;ub|ject as fit to be taxed directly as the rent of land.</P>
<P>THERE are, however, two different circum&s;tances which render the intere&s;t of money a much le&s;s proper &s;ubject of direct taxa|tion than the rent of land.</P>
<P>FIRST, the quantity and value of the land which any man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es can never be a &s;ecret, and can always be a&s;certained with great exactne&s;s. But the whole amount of the capital &s;tock which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is almo&s;t always a &s;ecret, and can &s;carce ever be a&s;certained with tolerable exactne&s;s. It is liable, be&s;ides, to almo&s;t continual variations. A year &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es away, fre|quently not a month, &s;ometimes &s;carce a &s;ingle day, in which it does not ri&s;e or fall more or le&s;s. An inqui&s;ition into every man's private circum&s;tances, and an inqui&s;ition which, in order to
<PB N="455" REF="457">
accommodate the tax to them, watched over all the fluctuations of his fortune, would be a &s;ource of &s;uch continual and endle&s;s vexation as no people could &s;upport.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, land is a &s;ubject which cannot be removed; whereas &s;tock ea&s;ily may. The proprietor of land is nece&s;&s;arily a citizen of the particular country in which his e&s;tate lies. The proprietor of &s;tock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not nece&s;&s;arily attached to any particular country. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was expo&s;ed to a vexatious inqui&s;ition, in order to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to a burden&s;ome tax, and would remove his &s;tock to &s;ome other country where he could either carry on his bu&s;ine&s;s or enjoy his fortune more at his ea&s;e. By removing his &s;tock he would put an end to all the indu&s;try which it had maintained in the country which he left. Stock cultivates land; &s;tock employs labour. A tax which tended to drive away &s;tock from any particular country, would &s;o far tend to dry up every &s;ource of revenue, both to the &s;overeign and to the &s;ociety. Not only the profits of &s;tock, but the rent of land and the wages of labour, would nece&s;&s;arily be more or le&s;s dimini&s;hed by its removal.</P>
<P>THE nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue ari&s;ing from &s;tock, in&s;tead of any &s;evere inqui&s;ition of this kind, have been obliged to content them&s;elves with &s;ome very loo&s;e, and therefore more or le&s;s arbitrary e&s;timation. The extreme inequality and uncertainty of a tax a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this man|ner, can be compen&s;ated only by its extreme moderation, in con&s;equence of which every man finds him&s;elf rated &s;o very much below his real revenue, that he gives him&s;elf little di&s;tur|bance though his neighbour &s;hould be rated &s;omewhat lower.</P>
<P>BY what is called the land-tax in England, it was intended that &s;tock &s;hould be taxed in the &s;ame proportion as land.
<PB N="456" REF="458">
When the tax upon land was at four &s;hillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the &s;uppo&s;ed rent, it was intended that &s;tock &s;hould be taxed at one-fifth of the &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t. When the pre&s;ent annual land-tax was fir&s;t impo&s;ed, the legal rate of in|tere&s;t was &s;ix per cent. Every hundred pounds &s;tock, accord|ingly, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be taxed at twenty-four &s;hillings, the fifth part of &s;ix pounds. Since the legal rate of intere&s;t has been reduced to five per cent. every hundred pounds &s;tock is &s;uppo&s;ed to be taxed at twenty &s;hillings only. The &s;um to be rai&s;ed, by what is called the land-tax, was divided between the country and the principal towns. The greater part of it was laid upon the country; and of what was laid upon the towns, the greater part was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the hou&s;es. What remained to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the &s;tock or trade of the towns (for the &s;tock upon the land was not meant to be taxed) was very much below the real value of that &s;tock or trade. Whatever inequalities, therefore, there might be in the original a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, gave little di&s;turbance. Every pari&s;h and di&s;trict &s;till continues to be rated for its land, its hou&s;es, and its &s;tock, according to the original a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; and the almo&s;t univer&s;al pro&s;perity of the country, which in mo&s;t places has rai&s;ed very much the value of all the&s;e, has rendered tho&s;e inequalities of &s;till le&s;s importance now. The rate too upon each di&s;trict continuing always the &s;ame, the uncertainty of this tax, &s;o far as it might be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the &s;tock of any individual, has been very much dimini&s;hed, as well as ren|dered of much le&s;s con&s;equence. If the greater part of the lands of England are not rated to the land-tax at half their actual value, the greater part of the &s;tock of England is perhaps &s;carce rated at the fiftieth part of its actual value. In &s;ome towns the whole land-tax is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon hou&s;es; as in We&s;tmin&s;ter, where &s;tock and trade are free. It is otherwi&s;e in London.</P>

Every man a&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and, in the pre&s;ence of the magi&s;trate, puts an|nually into the public coffer a certain &s;um of money, which he declares upon oath to be one-fourth per cent. of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, but without declaring what it amounts to, or being liable to any examination upon that &s;ubject.

In a &s;mall republic, where the people have entire confidence in their magi&s;trates, are convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of the tax for the &s;upport of the &s;tate, and believe that it will be faithfully applied to that purpo&s;e, &s;uch con&s;cientious and voluntary payment may &s;ometimes be expected.

<P>To oblige every citizen to declare publickly upon oath the amount of his fortune, mu&s;t not, it &s;eems, in tho&s;e Swi&s;s cantons, be reckoned a hard&s;hip. At Hamburgh it would be reckoned the greate&s;t. Merchants engaged in the hazardous projects of trade, all tremble at the thoughts of being obliged at all times to expo&s;e the real &s;tate of their circum&s;tances. The ruin of their credit and the mi&s;carriage of their projects, they fore&s;ee, would too often be the con&s;equence. A &s;ober and par&s;imonious people, who are &s;trangers to all &s;uch projects, do not feel that they have occa&s;ion for any &s;uch concealment.</P>
<P>IN Holland, &s;oon after the exaltation of the Iate prince of Orange to the &s;tadtholder&s;hip, a tax of two per cent. or the fiftieth penny, as it was called, was impo&s;ed upon the whole &s;ub&s;tance of every citizen. Every citizen a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf and paid his tax in the &s;ame manner as at Hamburgh; and it was in general &s;uppo&s;ed to have been paid with great fidelity. The people had at that time the greate&s;t affection for their new government, which they had ju&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by a general in&s;urrection. The tax was to be paid but once; in order to relieve the &s;tate in a particular exigency. It was, indeed, too heavy to be permanent. In a country where the market rate of intere&s;t &s;eldom exceeds three per cent. a tax of two per cent. amounts to thirteen &s;hillings and fourpence in the pound upon the highe&s;t neat revenue which is commonly drawn from &s;tock. It is a tax
<PB N="459" REF="461">
which very few people could pay without encroaching more or le&s;s upon their capitals. In a particular exigency the people may, from great public zeal, make a great effort, and give up even a part of their capital in order to relieve the &s;tate. But it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould continue to do &s;o for any con&s;iderable time; and if they did, the tax would &s;oon ruin them &s;o completely as to render them altogether incapable of &s;upporting the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE tax upon &s;tock impo&s;ed by the land-tax bill in England, tho' it is proportioned to the capital, is not intended to dimini&s;h or take away any part of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the intere&s;t of money proportioned to that upon the rent of land; &s;o that when the latter is at four &s;hillings in the pound, the former may be at four &s;hillings in the pound too. The tax at Hamburgh, and the &s;till more moderate taxes of Underwold and Zurich, are meant, in the &s;ame manner, to be taxes, not upon the capital, but upon the intere&s;t or neat revenue of &s;tock. That of Holland was meant to be a tax upon the capital.</P>

<HEAD>Taxes upon the Profit of particular Employments.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;ome countries extraordinary taxes are impo&s;ed upon the profits of &s;tock; &s;ometimes when employed in particular branches of trade, and &s;ometimes when employed in agriculture.</P>
<P>OF the former kind are in England the tax upon hawkers and pedlars, that upon hackney coaches and chairs, and that which the keepers of ale-hou&s;es pay for a licence to retail ale and &s;pirituous liquors. During the late war, another tax of the &s;ame kind was propo&s;ed upon &s;hops. The war having been undertaken, it was &s;aid, in defence of the trade of the country, the merchants,
<PB N="460" REF="462">
who were to profit by it, ought to contribute towards the &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>A TAX, however, upon the profits of &s;tock employed in any parti|cular branch of trade, can never fall finally upon the dealers (who mu&s;t in all ordinary ca&s;es have their rea&s;onable profit, and, where the competition is free, can &s;eldom have more than that profit) but always upon the con&s;umers, who mu&s;t be obliged to pay in the price of the goods the tax which the dealer advances; and generally with &s;ome over-charge.</P>
<P>A TAX of this kind, when it is proportioned to the trade of the dealer, is finally paid by the con&s;umer, and occa&s;ions no oppre&s;&s;ion to the dealer. When it is not &s;o proportioned, but is the &s;ame upon all dealers, though in this ca&s;e too it is finally paid by the con&s;umer, yet it favours the great, and occa&s;ions &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ion to the &s;mall dealer. The tax of five &s;hillings a week upon every hack|ney coach, and that of ten &s;hillings a year upon every hackney chair, &s;o far as it is advanced by the different keepers of &s;uch coaches and chairs, is exactly enough proportioned to the extent of their re&s;pective dealings. It neither favours the great, nor oppre&s;&s;es the &s;maller dealer. The tax of twenty &s;hillings a year for a licence to &s;ell ale; of forty &s;hillings for a licence to &s;ell &s;pirituous liquors; and of forty &s;hillings more for a licence to &s;ell wine, being the &s;ame upon all retailers, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give &s;ome advantage to the great, and occa&s;ion &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ion to the &s;mall dealers. The former mu&s;t find it more ea&s;y to get back the tax in the price of their goods than the latter. The moderation of the tax, however, renders this inequality of le&s;s importance, and it may to many people appear not improper to give &s;ome di&s;couragement to the multiplication of little ale-hou&s;es. The tax upon &s;hops, it was intended, &s;hould be the &s;ame upon all &s;hops. It could not well have been otherwi&s;e. It
<PB N="461" REF="463">
would have been impo&s;&s;ible to proportion with tolerable exactne&s;s the tax upon a &s;hop to the extent of the trade carried on in it, without &s;uch an inqui&s;ition, as would have been altogether in&s;up|portable in a free country. If the tax had been con&s;iderable, it would have oppre&s;&s;ed the &s;mall, and forced almo&s;t the whole retail trade into the hands of the great dealers. The competition of the former being taken away, the latter would have enjoyed a mono|poly of the trade; and like all other monopoli&s;ts would &s;oon have combined to rai&s;e their profits much beyond what was nece&s;&s;ary for the payment of the tax. The final payment, in&s;tead of falling upon the &s;hopkeeper, would have fallen upon the con&s;umer, with a con&s;iderable over-charge to the profit of the &s;hopkeeper. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the project of a tax upon &s;hops was laid a&s;ide, and in the room of it was &s;ub&s;tituted the &s;ub&s;idy 1759.</P>
<P>WHAT in France is called the per&s;onal taille is, perhaps, the mo&s;t important tax upon the profits of &s;tock employed in agricul|ture that is levied in any part of Europe.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;orderly &s;tate of Europe during the prevalence of the feudal government, the &s;overeign was obliged to content him&s;elf with taxing tho&s;e who were too weak to refu&s;e to pay taxes. The great lords, though willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him upon particular emergencies, refu&s;ed to &s;ubject them&s;elves to any con&s;tant tax, and he was not &s;trong enough to force them. The occupiers of land, all over Europe, were the greater part of them originally bond-men. Through the greater part of Europe they were gradually eman|cipated. Some of them acquired the property of landed e&s;tates which they held by &s;ome ba&s;e or ignoble tenure, &s;ometimes under the king, and &s;ometimes under &s;ome other great lord, like the antient copy-holders of England. Others, without acquiring the property, obtained lea&s;es for terms of years of the lands which they occu|pied
<PB N="462" REF="464">
under their lord, and thus became le&s;s dependent upon him. The great lords &s;eem to have beheld the degree of pro&s;perity and independency which this inferior order of men had thus come to enjoy, with malignant and contemptuous indignation, and wil|lingly con&s;ented that the &s;overeign &s;hould tax them. In &s;ome coun|tries this tax was confined to the lands which were held in property by an ignoble tenure; and, in this ca&s;e, the taille was &s;aid to be real. The land-tax e&s;tabli&s;hed by the late king of Sardinia, and the taille in the provinces of Languedoc, Provence, Dauphin&eacute;, and Brittany; in the generality of Montauban, and in the elections of Agen and Condom, as well as in &s;ome other di&s;tricts of France, are taxes upon lands held in property by an ignoble tenure. In other countries the tax was laid upon the &s;uppo&s;ed profits of all tho&s;e who held in farm or lea&s;e lands belonging to other people, whatever might be the tenure by which the proprietor held them; and in this ca&s;e the taille was &s;aid to be per&s;onal. In the greater part of tho&s;e provinces of France, which are called the Countries of Elections, the taille is of this kind. The real taille, as it is impo&s;ed only upon a part of the lands of the country, is nece&s;&s;a|rily an unequal, but it is not always an arbitrary tax, though it is &s;o upon &s;ome occa&s;ions. The per&s;onal taille, as it is intended to be proportioned to the profits of a certain cla&s;s of people, which can only be gue&s;&s;ed at, is nece&s;&s;arily both arbitrary and unequal.</P>
<P>IN France the per&s;onal taille at pre&s;ent, (1775,) annually impo&s;ed upon the twenty generalities, called the Countries of Elections, amounts to 40,107,239 livres, 16 &s;ous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droits, &amp;c. tome ii. p. 17.</NOTE>. The proportion in which this &s;um is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon tho&s;e different provinces, varies from year to year, according to the reports which are made to the king's council concerning the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of the crop, as well as other circum&s;tances which may either increa&s;e or dimini&s;h their
<PB N="463" REF="465">
re&s;pective abilities to pay. Each generality is divided into a cer|tain number of elections, and the proportion in which the &s;um impo&s;ed upon the whole generality is divided among tho&s;e different elections, varies likewi&s;e from year to year, according to the reports made to the council concerning their re&s;pective abilities. It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that the council, with the be&s;t intentions, can ever pro|portion with tolerable exactne&s;s, either of tho&s;e two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments to the real abilities of the province or di&s;trict upon which they are re&s;pectively laid. Ignorance and mi&s;information mu&s;t always, more or le&s;s, mi&s;lead the mo&s;t upright council. The proportion which each pari&s;h ought to &s;upport of what is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the whole election, and that which each individual ought to &s;upport of what is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon his particular pari&s;h, are both in the &s;ame manner varied, from year to year, according as circum&s;tances are &s;uppo&s;ed to require. The&s;e circum&s;tances are judged of, in the one ca&s;e, by the officers of the election; in the other by tho&s;e of the pari&s;h; and both the one and the other are, more or le&s;s, under the direc|tion and influence of the intendant. Not only ignorance and mi&s;|information, but friend&s;hip, party animo&s;ity, and private re&s;ent|ment, are &s;aid frequently to mi&s;lead &s;uch a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. No man &s;ub|ject to &s;uch a tax, it is evident, can ever be certain, before he is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of what he is to pay. He cannot even be certain after he is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If any per&s;on has been taxed who ought to have been exempted; or if any per&s;on has been taxed beyond his proportion, though both mu&s;t pay in the mean time, yet if they complain and make good their complaints, the whole pari&s;h is reimpo&s;ed next year in order to reimbur&s;e them. If any of the contributors become bank|rupt or in&s;olvent, the collector is obliged to advance his tax, and the whole pari&s;h is reimpo&s;ed next year in order to reimbur&s;e the collector. If the collector him&s;elf &s;hould become bankrupt, the pari&s;h which elects him mu&s;t an&s;wer for his conduct to the receiver|general of the election. But, as it might be trouble&s;ome for the
<PB N="464" REF="466">
receiver to pro&s;ecute the whole pari&s;h, he takes at his choice five or &s;ix of the riche&s;t contributors, and obliges them to make good what had been lo&s;t by the in&s;olvency of the collector. The pari&s;h is afterwards reimpo&s;ed in order to reimbur&s;e tho&s;e five or &s;ix. Such reimpo&s;itions are always over and above the taille of the particular year in which they are laid on.</P>
<P>WHEN a tax is impo&s;ed upon the profits of &s;tock in a particular branch of trade, the traders are all careful to bring no more goods to market than what they can &s;ell at a price &s;ufficient to reimbur&s;e them for advancing the tax. Some of them withdraw a part of their &s;tocks from the trade, and the market is more &s;paringly &s;up|plied than before. The price of the goods ri&s;es, and the final pay|ment of the tax falls upon the con&s;umer. But when a tax is im|po&s;ed upon the profits of &s;tock employed in agriculture, it is not the intere&s;t of the farmers to withdraw any part of their &s;tock from that employment. Each farmer occupies a certain quantity of land, for which he pays rent. For the proper cultivation of this land a certain quantity of &s;tock is nece&s;&s;ary; and by withdraw|ing any part of this nece&s;&s;ary quantity, the farmer is not likely to be more able to pay either the rent or the tax. In order to pay the tax, it can never be his intere&s;t to dimini&s;h the quantity of his produce, nor con&s;equently to &s;upply the market more &s;paringly than before. The tax, therefore, will never enable him to rai&s;e the price of his produce, nor to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf by throwing the final payment upon the con&s;umer. The farmer, however, mu&s;t have his rea&s;onable profit as well as every other dealer, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t give up the trade. After the impo&s;ition of a tax of this kind, he can get this rea&s;onable profit only by paying le&s;s rent to the land|lord. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the le&s;s he can afford to pay in the way of rent. A tax of this kind impo&s;ed during the currency of a lea&s;e may, no doubt, di&s;tre&s;s or ruin the
<PB N="465" REF="467">
farmer. Upon the renewal of the lea&s;e it mu&s;t always fall upon the landlord.</P>
<P>IN the countries where the per&s;onal taille takes place, the farmer is commonly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in proportion to the &s;tock which he appears to employ in cultivation. He is, upon this account, frequently afraid to have a good team of hor&s;es or oxen, but endeavours to cultivate with the meane&s;t and mo&s;t wretched in&s;truments of hu&s;|bandry that he can. Such is his di&s;tru&s;t in the ju&s;tice of his a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors, that he counterfeits poverty, and wi&s;hes to appear &s;carce able to pay any thing for fear of being obliged to pay too much. By this mi&s;erable policy he does not, perhaps, always con&s;ult his own inte|re&s;t in the mo&s;t effectual manner; and he probably lo&s;es more by the diminution of his produce than he &s;aves by that of his tax. Though, in con&s;equence of this wretched cultivation the market is, no doubt, &s;omewhat wor&s;e &s;upplied; yet the &s;mall ri&s;e of price which this may occa&s;ion, as it is not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the diminution of his produce, it is &s;till le&s;s likely to enable him to pay more rent to the landlord. The public, the far|mer, the landlord, all &s;uffer more or le&s;s by this degraded cultiva|tion. That the per&s;onal taille tends, in many different ways, to di&s;courage cultivation, and con&s;equently to dry up the principal &s;ource of the wealth of every great country, I have already had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in the third book of this inquiry.</P>
<P>WHAT are called poll-taxes in the &s;outhern provinces of North America, and in the We&s;t India i&s;lands, annual taxes of &s;o much a head upon every negro, are properly taxes upon the profits of a certain &s;pecies of &s;tock employed in agriculture. As the planters are, the greater part of them, both farmers and landlords, the final payment of the tax falls upon them in their quality of land|lords without any retribution.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="468">
TAXES of &s;o much a head upon the bondmen employed in cul|tivation, &s;eem antiently to have been common all over Europe. There &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent a tax of this kind in the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia. It is probably upon this account that poll-taxes of all kinds have often been repre&s;ented as badges of &s;lavery. Every tax, however, is to the per&s;on who pays it a badge, not of &s;lavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is &s;ubject to government, indeed, but that, as he has &s;ome property, he cannot him&s;elf be the property of a ma&s;ter. A poll-tax upon &s;laves, is altogether different from a poll-tax upon freemen. The latter is paid by the per&s;ons upon whom it is im|po&s;ed; the former by a different &s;et of per&s;ons. The latter is either altogether arbitrary or altogether unequal, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es is both the one and the other; the former, though in &s;ome re&s;pects un|equal, different &s;laves being of different values, is in no re&s;pect arbi|trary. Every ma&s;ter who knows the number of his own &s;laves, knows exactly what he has to pay. Tho&s;e different taxes, however, being called by the &s;ame name, have been con&s;idered as of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>TAXES upon the profits of &s;tock in particular employments can never affect the intere&s;t of money. Nobody will lend his money for le&s;s intere&s;t to tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the taxed, than to tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the untaxed employments. Taxes upon the revenue ari&s;ing from &s;tock in all employments, where the government attempts to levy them with any degree of exactne&s;s, will, in many ca&s;es, fall upon the intere&s;t of money. The Vingtieme or twentieth-penny in France, is a tax of the &s;ame kind with what is called the land-tax in England, and is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the &s;ame manner, upon the revenue ari&s;ing from land, hou&s;es, and &s;tock. So far as it affects &s;tock, it is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, though not with great rigour, yet with much more exactne&s;s than that part of the land-tax of England which is impo&s;ed upon the &s;ame fund. It, in many ca&s;es, falls altogether upon the inte|re&s;t
<PB N="467" REF="469">
of money. Money is frequently &s;unk in France upon what are called Contracts for the con&s;titution of a rent, that is, perpe|tual annuities redeemable at any time by the debtor upon repay|ment of the &s;um originally advanced, but of which this redemption is not exigible by the creditor except in particular ca&s;es. The ving|tieme &s;eems not to have rai&s;ed the rate of tho&s;e annuities, though it is exactly levied upon them all.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX to ARTICLES I. and II.<HI>Taxes upon the capital Value of Land, Hou&s;es, and Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE property remains in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame per&s;on, whatever permanent taxes may have been impo&s;ed upon it, they have never been intended to dimini&s;h or take away any part of its capital value, but only &s;ome part of the revenue ari&s;ing from it. But when property changes hands, when it is tran&s;mitted either from the dead to the living, or from the living to the living, &s;uch taxes have frequently been impo&s;ed upon it as nece&s;&s;arily take away &s;ome part of its capital value.</P>
<P>THE transference of all &s;orts of property from the dead to the living, and that of immoveable property, of land and hou&s;es, from the living to the living, are tran&s;actions which are in their nature either public and notorious, or &s;uch as cannot be long concealed. Such tran&s;actions, therefore, may be taxed directly. The trans|ference of &s;tock or immoveable property from the living to the living by the lending of money, is frequently a &s;ecret tran&s;action, and may always be made &s;o. It cannot ea&s;ily, therefore, be taxed directly. It has been taxed indirectly in two different ways; fir&s;t, by requiring that the deed, containing the obligation to repay, &s;hould be written upon paper or parchment, which had paid a
<PB N="468" REF="470">
certain &s;tamp-duty, otherwi&s;e not to be valid; &s;econdly, by re|quiring, under the like penalty of invalidity, that it &s;hould be recorded either in a public or &s;ecret regi&s;ter, and by impo&s;ing cer|tain duties upon &s;uch regi&s;tration. Stamp-duties and duties of regi&s;tration have frequently been impo&s;ed likewi&s;e upon the deeds transferring property of all kinds from the dead to the living, and upon tho&s;e transferring immoveable property from the living to the living, tran&s;actions which might ea&s;ily have been taxed directly.</P>
<P>THE Vice&s;ima Hereditatum, the twentieth penny of inheritances, impo&s;ed by Augu&s;tus upon the antient Romans, was a tax upon the transference of property from the dead to the living. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 55. See al&s;o Burman de Vectigalibus pop. Rom. cap. xi. and Bouchaud de l' imp&ocirc;t du vingtieme &s;ur les &s;ucce&s;&s;ions.</NOTE>, the author who writes concerning it the lea&s;t indi&s;tinctly, &s;ays, that it was impo&s;ed upon all &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, legacies and dona|tions, in ca&s;e of death, except upon tho&s;e to the neare&s;t relations, and to the poor.</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame kind is the Dutch tax upon &s;ucce&s;&s;ions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droits, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 225.</NOTE>. Colla|teral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions are taxed, according to the degree of relation, from five to thirty per cent. upon the whole value of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Te&s;tamentary donations or legacies to collaterals, are &s;ubject to the like duties. Tho&s;e from hu&s;band to wife, or from wife to hu&s;|band, to the fiftieth penny. The Luctuo&s;a Hereditas, the mourn|ful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a&s;cendents to de&s;cendents, to the twentieth penny only. Direct &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, or tho&s;e of de&s;cendents to a&s;cendents, pay no tax. The death of a father, to &s;uch of his children as live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, is &s;eldom attended with any increa&s;e, and frequently with a con&s;iderable diminution of revenue; by the lo&s;s of his indu&s;try, of his office, or of &s;ome life-rent e&s;tate, of which he may have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. That tax would be cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive which aggravated their lo&s;s by taking from them any part
<PB N="469" REF="471">
of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It may, however, &s;ometimes be otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e children who, in the language of the Roman law, are &s;aid to be emancipated; in that of the Scotch law, to be foris-fami|liated; that is, who have received their portion, have got fami|lies of their own, and are &s;upported by funds &s;eparate and inde|pendent of tho&s;e of their father. Whatever part of his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion might come to &s;uch children, would be a real addition to their fortune, and might, therefore, perhaps, without more incon|veniency than what attends all duties of this kind, be liable to &s;ome tax.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;ualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the tran&s;|ference of land, both from the dead to the living, and from the living to the living. In antient times they con&s;tituted in every part of Europe one of the principal branches of the revenue of the crown.</P>
<P>THE heir of every immediate va&s;&s;al of the crown paid a cer|tain duty, generally a year's rent, upon receiving the inve&s;titure of the e&s;tate. If the heir was a minor, the whole rents of the e&s;tate, during the continuance of the minority, devolved to the &s;uperior without any other charge, be&s;ides the maintenance of the minor, and the payment of the widow's dower, when there hap|pened to be a dowager, upon the land. When the minor came to be of age, another tax, called Relief, was &s;till due to the &s;uperior, which generally amounted likewi&s;e to a year's rent. A long minority, which in the pre&s;ent times &s;o frequently di&s;burdens a great e&s;tate of all its incumbrances, and re&s;tores the family to their antient &s;plendor, could in tho&s;e times have no &s;uch effect. The wa&s;te, and not the di&s;|incumbrance of the e&s;tate, was the common effect of a long minority.</P>
<P>BY the feudal law the va&s;&s;al could not alienate without the con&s;ent of his &s;uperior, who generally extorted a fine or com|po&s;ition for granting it. This fine, which was at fir&s;t arbitrary, came in many countries to be regulated at a certain portion
<PB N="470" REF="472">
of the price of the land. In &s;ome countries, where the greater part of the other feudal cu&s;toms have gone into di&s;u&s;e, this tax upon the alienation of land &s;till continues to make a con&s;iderable branch of the revenue of the &s;overeign.

<P>IN Great Britain the &s;tamp-duties are higher or lower, not &s;o much according to the value of the property transferred, (an eighteen penny or half crown &s;tamp being &s;ufficient upon a bond for the large&s;t &s;um of money) as according to the nature of the deed. The highe&s;t do not exceed &s;ix pounds upon every &s;heet of paper, or &s;kin of parchment; and the&s;e high duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain law proceedings; without any regard to the value of the &s;ubject. There are in Great Britain no duties on the regi&s;tration of deeds or writings, except the fees of the officers, who keep the regi&s;ter; and the&s;e are &s;eldom more than a rea&s;onable recompence for their labour. The crown derives no revenue from them.</P>

IN Holland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Id. tom. i. p. 223, 224, 225.</NOTE> there are both &s;tamp-duties and duties upon regi|&s;tration; which in &s;ome ca&s;es are, and in &s;ome are not proportioned to the value of the property transferred. All te&s;taments mu&s;t be writ|ten upon &s;tampt-paper, of which the price is proportioned to the property di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;o that there are &s;tamps which co&s;t from three|pence, or three &s;tivers a &s;heet, to three hundred florins, equal to about twenty-&s;even pound ten &s;hillings of our money. If the &s;tamp is of an inferior price to what the te&s;tator ought to have made u&s;e of, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is confi&s;cated. This is over and above all their other taxes on &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Except bills of exchange, and &s;ome other mercantile bills, all other deeds, bonds and contracts, are &s;ubject to a &s;tamp-duty. This duty, however, does not ri&s;e in proportion to the value of the &s;ubject. All &s;ales of land and of hou&s;es, and all mortgages upon either, mu&s;t be regi&s;tered, and, upon regi&s;tration, pay a duty to the &s;tate of two and a half per cent. upon the amount of the price or the mortgage. This duty is extended to the &s;ale of all &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els of more than two tons burthen, whether decked or undecked. The&s;e, it &s;eems, are con&s;idered as a &s;ort of hou&s;es upon the water. The &s;ale of moveables, when it is ordered by a court of ju&s;tice, is &s;ubject to the like duty of two and a half per cent.</P>
<P>IN France there are both &s;tamp-duties and duties upon regi|&s;tration. The former are con&s;idered as a branch of the aides or exci&s;e, and in the provinces where tho&s;e duties take place, are levied by the exci&s;e officers. The latter are con&s;idered as a branch of the domaine of the crown, and are levied by a different &s;et of officers.</P>
<P>THOSE modes of taxation, by &s;tamp-duties and by duties upon regi&s;tration, are of very modern invention. In the cour&s;e of little more than a century, however, &s;tamp-duties have, in Europe, become almo&s;t univer&s;al, and duties upon regi&s;tration
<PB N="472" REF="474">
extremely common. There is no art which one government &s;ooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people.</P>
<P>TAXES upon the transference of property from the dead to the living, fall finally as well as immediately upon the per&s;on to whom the property is transferred. Taxes upon the &s;ale of land fall altogether upon the &s;eller. The &s;eller is almo&s;t always under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling, and mu&s;t, therefore, take &s;uch a price as he can get. The buyer is &s;carce ever under the nece&s;&s;ity of buying, and will, therefore, give only &s;uch a price as he likes. He con&s;iders what the land will co&s;t him in tax and price toge|ther. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the le&s;s he will be di&s;po&s;ed to give in the way of price. Such taxes, therefore, fall almo&s;t always upon a nece&s;&s;itous per&s;on, and mu&s;t, therefore, be frequently very cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive. Taxes upon the &s;ale of new-built hou&s;es, where the building is &s;old without the ground, fall generally upon the buyer, becau&s;e the builder mu&s;t generally have his profit; otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t give up the trade. If he advances the tax, therefore, the buyer mu&s;t gene|rally repay it to him. Taxes upon the &s;ale of old hou&s;es, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as tho&s;e upon the &s;ale of land, fall generally upon the &s;eller; whom in mo&s;t ca&s;es either conveniency or nece&s;&s;ity obliges to &s;ell. The number of new built hou&s;es that are annu|ally brought to market, is more or le&s;s regulated by the demand. Unle&s;s the demand is &s;uch as to afford the builder his profit, after paying all expences, he will build no more hou&s;es. The number of old hou&s;es which happen at any time to come to market is regulated by accidents of which the greater part have no relation to the demand. Two or three great bankruptcies in a mercan|tile town, will bring many hou&s;es to &s;ale, which mu&s;t be &s;old for what can be got for them. Taxes upon the &s;ale of ground|rents fall altogether upon the &s;eller; for the &s;ame rea&s;on as tho&s;e
<PB N="473" REF="475">
upon the &s;ale of land, Stamp duties, and duties upon the regi|&s;tration of bonds and contracts for borrowed money, fall alto|gether upon the borrower, and, in fact, are always paid by him. Duties of the &s;ame kind upon law proceedings fall upon the &s;uitors. They reduce to both the capital value of the &s;ubject in di&s;pute. The more it co&s;ts to acquire any property, the le&s;s mu&s;t be the value of it when acquired.</P>
<P>ALL taxes upon the transference of property of every kind, &s;o far as they dimini&s;h the capital value of that property, tend to dimini&s;h the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour. They are all more or le&s;s unthrifty taxes that increa&s;e the revenue of the &s;overeign, which &s;eldom maintains any but unproductive labourers, at the expence of the capital of the people which maintains none but productive.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes, even when they are proportioned to the value of the property transferred, are &s;till unequal; the frequency of tran&s;|ference not being always equal in property of equal value. When they are not proportioned to this value, which is the ca&s;e with the greater part of the &s;tamp-duties, and duties of regi&s;tration, they are &s;till more &s;o. They are in no re&s;pect arbitrary, but are or may be in all ca&s;es perfectly clear and certain. Though they &s;ometimes fall upon the per&s;on who is not very able to pay; the time of payment is in mo&s;t ca&s;es &s;ufficiently convenient for him. When the payment becomes due, he mu&s;t in mo&s;t ca&s;es have the money to pay. They are levied at very little expence, and in general &s;ubject the contributors to no other inconveniency be&s;ides always the unavoidable one of paying the tax.</P>
<P>IN France the &s;tamp-duties are not much complained of. Tho&s;e of regi&s;tration, which they call the Contr&ocirc;le, are. They give occa&s;ion, it is pretended, to much extortion in the officers of the
<PB N="474" REF="476">
farmers general who collect the tax, which is in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary and uncertain. In the greater part of the libels which have been written again&s;t the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of finances in France, the abu&s;es of the contr&ocirc;le make a principal article. Uncertainty, however, does not &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;arily inherent in the nature of &s;uch taxes. If the popular complaints are well founded, the abu&s;e mu&s;t ari&s;e, not &s;o much from the nature of the tax, as from the want of preci&s;ion and di&s;tinctne&s;s in the words of the edicts or laws which impo&s;e it.</P>
<P>THE regi&s;tration of mortgages, and in general of all rights upon immoveable property, as it gives great &s;ecurity both to creditors and purcha&s;ers, is extremely advantageous to the pub|lic. That of the greater part of deeds of other kinds is frequently inconvenient and even dangerous to individuals, without any advantage to the public. All regi&s;ters which, it is acknow|ledged, ought to be kept &s;ecret, ought certainly never to exi&s;t. The credit of individuals ought certainly never to depend upon &s;o very &s;lender a &s;ecurity as the probity and religion of the inferior officers of revenue. But where the fees of regi&s;tration have been made a &s;ource of revenue to the &s;overeign, regi&s;ter offices have commonly been multiplied without end, both for the deeds which ought to be regi&s;tered, and for tho&s;e which ought not. In France there are &s;everal different &s;orts of &s;ecret regi&s;ters. This abu&s;e, though not perhaps a nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is a very natural effect of &s;uch taxes.</P>
<P>SUCH &s;tamp-duties as tho&s;e in England upon cards and dice, upon news-papers and periodical pamphlets, &amp;c. are properly taxes upon con&s;umption; the final payment falls upon the per|&s;ons who u&s;e or con&s;ume &s;uch commodities. Such &s;tamp-duties as tho&s;e upon licences to retail ale, wine and &s;pirituous liquors, though intended perhaps to fall upon the profits of the retailers, are
<PB N="475" REF="477">
likewi&s;e finally paid by the con&s;umers of tho&s;e liquors. Such taxes, though called by the &s;ame name, and levied by the &s;ame officers and in the &s;ame manner with the &s;tamp-duties above men|tioned upon the transference of property, are however of a quite different nature, and fall upon quite different funds.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE III. <HI>Taxes upon the Wages of Labour.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE wages of the inferior cla&s;&s;es of workmen, I have endea|voured to &s;how in the fir&s;t book, are every where nece&s;&s;arily regulated by two different circum&s;tances; the demand for labour, and the ordinary or average price of provi&s;ions. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be either increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining; or to require an increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining population, regulates the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the labourer, and determines in what degree it &s;hall be, either liberal, moderate, or &s;canty. The ordinary or average price of provi&s;ions determines the quantity of money which mu&s;t be paid to the workman in order to enable him, one year with another, to purcha&s;e this liberal, moderate, or &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. While the demand for labour and the price of provi&s;ions, therefore, remain the &s;ame, a direct tax upon the wages of labour can have no other effect than to rai&s;e them &s;ome|what higher than the tax. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, that in a particular place the demand for labour and the price of provi|&s;ions were &s;uch as to render ten &s;hillings a week the ordinary wages of labour; and that a tax of one-fifth, or four &s;hillings in the pound, was impo&s;ed upon wages. If the demand for labour and the price of provi&s;ions remained the &s;ame, it would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary that the labourer &s;hould in that place earn &s;uch a &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence as could be bought only for ten &s;hillings a week, or that after
<PB N="476" REF="478">
paying the tax he &s;hould have ten &s;hillings a week free wages. But in order to leave him &s;uch free wages after paying &s;uch a tax, the price of labour mu&s;t in that place &s;oon ri&s;e, not to twelve &s;hillings a week only, but to twelve and &s;ixpence; that is, in order to enable him to pay a tax of one-fifth, his wages mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;oon ri&s;e, not one-fifth part only, but one-fourth. Whatever was the proportion of the tax, the wages of labour mu&s;t in all ca&s;es ri&s;e, not only in that proportion, but in a higher proportion. If the tax, for example, was one-tenth, the wages of labour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;oon ri&s;e, not one-tenth part only, but one-eighth.</P>
<P>A DIRECT tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer might perhaps pay it out of his hand, could not pro|perly be &s;aid to be even advanced by him; at lea&s;t if the demand for labour and the average price of provi&s;ions remained the &s;ame after the tax as before it. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, not only the tax, but &s;omething more than the tax, would in reality be advanced by the per&s;on who immediately employed him. The final payment would in different ca&s;es fall upon different per&s;ons. The ri&s;e which &s;uch a tax might occa&s;ion in the wages of manufacturing labour would be advanced by the ma&s;ter manufacturer, who would both be entitled and obliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his goods. The final payment of this ri&s;e of wages there|fore, together with the additional profit of the ma&s;ter manufac|turer, would fall upon the con&s;umer. The ri&s;e which &s;uch a tax might occa&s;ion in the wages of country labour would be advanced by the farmer, who in order to maintain the &s;ame number of labourers as before would be obliged to employ a greater capital. In order to get back this greater capital, together with the ordinary profits of &s;tock, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould retain a larger portion, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, the price of a larger portion, of the produce of the land, and con&s;equently that he
<PB N="477" REF="479">
&s;hould pay le&s;s rent to the landlord. The final payment of this ri&s;e of wages, therefore, would in this ca&s;e fall upon the landlord, together with the additional profit of the farmer who had advanced it. In all ca&s;es a direct tax upon the wages of labour mu&s;t, in the long run, occa&s;ion both a greater reduction in the rent of land, and a greater ri&s;e in the price of manufactured goods, than would have followed from the proper a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of a &s;um equal to the produce of the tax, partly upon the rent of land, and partly upon con&s;umable commodities.</P>
<P>IF direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occa|&s;ioned a proportionable ri&s;e in tho&s;e wages, it is becau&s;e they have generally occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable fall in the demand for labour. The declen&s;ion of indu&s;try, the decrea&s;e of employment for the poor, the diminution of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, have generally been the effects of &s;uch taxes. In con&s;equence of them, however, the price of labour mu&s;t al|ways be higher than it otherwi&s;e would have been in the actual &s;tate of the demand: and this enhancement of price, together with the profit of tho&s;e who advance it, mu&s;t always be finally paid by the landlords and con&s;umers.</P>
<P>A TAX upon the wages of country labour does not rai&s;e the price of the rude produce of land; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a tax upon the farmers profit does not rai&s;e that price.</P>
<P>ABSURD and de&s;tructive as &s;uch taxes are, however, they take place in many countries. In France that part of the taille which is charged upon the indu&s;try of workmen and day-labourers in country villages, is properly a tax of this kind. Their wages are computed according to the common rate of the di&s;trict in which they re&s;ide, and that they may be as little liable as po&s;&s;ible to any over-charge, their yearly gains are e&s;timated at no more than two
<PB N="478" REF="480">
hundred working days in the year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Id. tom. ii. p. 108.</NOTE>. The tax of each individual is varied from year to year according to different circum&s;tances, of which the collector or the commi&s;&s;ary, whom the intendant appoints to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, are the judges. In Bohemia, in con&s;equence of the alteration in the &s;y&s;tem of finances which was begun in 1748, a very heavy tax is impo&s;ed upon the indu&s;try of artificers. They are divided into four cla&s;&s;es. The highe&s;t cla&s;s pay a hundred florins a year; which, at two and twenty-pence halfpenny a florin, amounts to 9l. 7s. 6d. The &s;econd cla&s;s are taxed at &s;eventy; the third at fifty; and the fourth, comprehending artificers in vil|lages and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of tho&s;e in towns, at twenty-five florins <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. tom. iii. p. 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE recompence of ingenious arti&s;ts and of men of liberal pro|fe&s;&s;ions, I have endeavoured to &s;how in the fir&s;t book, nece&s;&s;arily keeps a certain proportion to the emoluments of inferior trades. A tax upon this recompence, therefore, could have no other effect than to rai&s;e it &s;omewhat higher than in proportion to the tax. If it did not ri&s;e in this manner, the ingenious arts and the liberal profe&s;&s;ions, being no longer upon a level with other trades, would be &s;o much de&s;erted that they would &s;oon return to that level.</P>
<P>THE emoluments of offices are not, like tho&s;e of trades and profe&s;&s;ions, regulated by the free competition of the market, and do not, therefore, always bear a ju&s;t proportion to what the nature of the employment requires. They are, perhaps in mo&s;t coun|tries, higher than it requires; the per&s;ons who have the admini|&s;tration of government being generally di&s;po&s;ed to reward both them&s;elves and their immediate dependents rather more than enough. The emoluments of offices, therefore, can in mo&s;t ca&s;es very well
<PB N="479" REF="481">
bear to be taxed. The per&s;ons, be&s;ides, who enjoy public offices, e&s;pecially the more lucrative, are in all countries the objects of ge|neral envy; and a tax upon their emoluments, even though it &s;hould be &s;omewhat higher than upon any other &s;ort of revenue, is always a very popular tax. In England, for example, when by the land-tax every other &s;ort of revenue was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at four &s;hillings in the pound, it was very popular to lay a real tax of five &s;hillings in the pound upon the &s;alaries of offices which exceeded a hundred pounds a year; tho&s;e of the judges and a few others le&s;s obnoxious to envy excepted. There are in England no other direct taxes upon the wages of labour.</P>

<P>CAPITATION taxes, if it is attempted to proportion them to the fortune or revenue of each contributor, become altogether arbi|trary. The &s;tate of a man's fortune varies from day to day, and without an inqui&s;ition more intolerable than any tax, and renewed at lea&s;t once every year, can only be gue&s;&s;ed at. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, therefore, mu&s;t in mo&s;t ca&s;es depend upon the good or bad hu|mour of his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and mu&s;t, therefore, be altogether arbitrary and uncertain.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="482">
CAPITATION taxes, if they are proportioned, not to the &s;up|po&s;ed fortune, but to the rank of each contributor, become alto|gether unequal; the degrees of fortune being frequently unequal in the &s;ame degree of rank.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes, therefore, if it is attempted to render them equal, become altogether arbitrary and uncertain; and if it is attempted to render them certain and not arbitrary, became altogether un|equal. Let the tax be light or heavy, uncertainty is always a great grievance. In a light tax a con&s;iderable degree of inequality may be &s;upported; in a heavy one it is altogether intolerable.</P>
<P>IN the different poll-taxes which took place in England, during the reign of William III. the contributors were, the greater part of them, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to the degree of their rank; as dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, earls, vi&s;counts, barons, e&s;quires, gentlemen, the elde&s;t and younge&s;t &s;ons of peers, &amp;c. All &s;hopkeepers and trade&s;|men worth more than three hundred pounds, that is, the better &s;ort of them, were &s;ubject to the &s;ame a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; how great &s;o|ever might be the difference in their fortunes. Their rank was more con&s;idered than their fortune. Several of tho&s;e who in the fir&s;t poll-tax were rated according to their &s;uppo&s;ed fortune, were afterwards rated according to their rank. Sergeants, attornies, and proctors at law, who in the fir&s;t poll-tax were a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at three &s;hillings in the pound of their &s;uppo&s;ed income, were afterwards a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as gentlemen. In the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of a tax, which was not very heavy, a con&s;iderable degree of inequality had been found le&s;s in&s;upportable than any degree of uncertainty.</P>
<P>IN the capitation which has been levied in France without any interruption &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, the highe&s;t orders of people are rated according to their rank by an invariable
<PB N="481" REF="483">
tarif; the lower orders of people, according to what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be their fortune, by an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment which varies from year to year. The officers of the king's court, the judges and other officers in the &s;uperior courts of ju&s;tice, the officers of the troops, &amp;c. are a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t manner. The inferior ranks of people in the provinces are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd. In France the great ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to a con&s;iderable degree of inequality in a tax which, &s;o far as it affects them, is not a very heavy one; but could not brook the arbitrary a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of an intendant. The inferior ranks of people mu&s;t, in that country, &s;uffer patiently the u&s;age which their &s;uperiors think proper to give them.</P>
<P>IN England the different poll-taxes never produced the &s;um which had been expected from them, or which, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, they might have produced, had they been exactly levied. In France the capitation always produces the &s;um expected from it. The mild government of England, when it a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the different ranks of people to the poll-tax, contented it&s;elf with what that a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment happened to produce; and required no compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s which the &s;tate might &s;u&s;tain either by tho&s;e who could not pay, or by tho&s;e who would not pay, (for there were many &s;uch), and who, by the indulgent execution of the law, were not forced to pay. The more &s;evere government of France a&s;&s;e&s;&s;es upon each generality a certain &s;um, which the intendant mu&s;t find as he can. If any province complains of being a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too high, it may, in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of next year, obtain an abatement propor|tioned to the over-charge of the year before: But it mu&s;t pay in the meantime. The intendant, in order to be &s;ure of finding the &s;um a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon his generality, was impowered to a&s;&s;e&s;s it in a larger &s;um, that the failure or inability of &s;ome of the contributors might be compen&s;ated by the over-charge of the re&s;t; and till 1765, the fixation of this &s;urplus a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, was left altogether
<PB N="482" REF="484">
to his di&s;cretion. In that year indeed the council a&s;&s;umed this power to it&s;elf. In the capitation of the provinces, it is ob&s;erved by the perfectly-well informed author of the Memoirs upon the impo&s;itions in France, the portion which falls upon the nobility, and upon tho&s;e who&s;e privileges exempt them from the taille, is the lea&s;t con&s;iderable. The large&s;t falls upon tho&s;e &s;ubject to the taille, who are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the capitation at &s;o much a pound of what they pay to that other tax.</P>
<P>CAPITATION taxes, &s;o far as they are levied upon the lower ranks of people, are direct taxes upon the wages of labour, and are attended with all the inconveniencies of &s;uch taxes.</P>
<P>CAPITATION taxes are levied at little expence; and, where they are rigorou&s;ly exacted, afford a very &s;ure revenue to the &s;tate. It is upon this account that in countries where the ea&s;e, comfort, and &s;ecurity of the inferior ranks of people are little attended to, capitation taxes are very common. It is in general, however, but a &s;mall part of the public revenue, which, in a great empire, has ever been drawn from &s;uch taxes; and the greate&s;t &s;um which they have ever afforded, might always have been found in &s;ome other way much more convenient to the people.</P>

The &s;tate not knowing how to tax directly and proportionably the revenue of its &s;ubjects, endeavours to tax it indirectly by taxing their expence, which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, will in mo&s;t ca&s;es be nearly in proportion to their
<PB N="483" REF="485">
revenue. Their expence is taxed by taxing the con&s;umable com|modities upon which it is laid out.</P>
<P>CONSUMABLE commodities are either nece&s;&s;aries or luxuries.</P>
<P>BY nece&s;&s;aries I under&s;tand, not only the commodities which are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life, but whatever the cu&s;tom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowe&s;t order, to be without. A linen &s;hirt, for ex|ample, is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, not a nece&s;&s;ary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I &s;uppo&s;e, very comfortably, though they had no linen. But in the pre&s;ent times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be a&s;hamed to appear in public without a linen &s;hirt, the want of which would be &s;uppo&s;ed to denote that di&s;graceful degree of poverty, which, it is pre&s;umed, no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Cu&s;tom, in the &s;ame manner, has rendered leather &s;hoes a nece&s;&s;ary of life in England. The poore&s;t creditable per&s;on of either &s;ex would be a&s;hamed to appear in public without them. In Scotland, cu&s;tom has rendered them a nece&s;&s;ary of life to the lowe&s;t order of men; but not to the &s;ame order of women, who may, without any di&s;credit, walk about bare-footed. In France, they are nece&s;&s;aries neither to men nor to women; the lowe&s;t rank of both &s;exes appearing there publicly, without any di&s;credit, &s;ometimes in wooden &s;hoes, and &s;ometimes bare-footed. Under nece&s;&s;aries, therefore, I comprehend, not only tho&s;e things which nature, but tho&s;e things which the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of decency have ren|dered nece&s;&s;ary to the lowe&s;t rank of people. All other things, I call luxuries; without meaning by this appellation, to throw the &s;malle&s;t degree of reproach upon the temperate u&s;e of them. Beer and ale, for example, in Great Britain, and wine, even in the wine countries, I call luxuries. A man of any rank may, without
<PB N="484" REF="486">
any reproach, ab&s;tain totally from ta&s;ting &s;uch liquors. Nature does not render them nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of life; and cu&s;tom no where renders it indecent to live without them.</P>
<P>AS the wages of labour are every where regulated partly by the demand for it, and partly by the average price of the nece&s;&s;ary articles of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; whatever rai&s;es this average price mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily rai&s;e tho&s;e wages, &s;o that the labourer may &s;till be able to purcha&s;e that quantity of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles which the &s;tate of the demand for labour, whether increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining, requires that he &s;hould have <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Cap. 8.</NOTE>. A tax upon tho&s;e ar|ticles nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;es their price &s;omewhat higher than the amount of the tax, becau&s;e the dealer, who advances the tax, mu&s;t generally get it back with a profit. Such a tax mu&s;t, there|fore, occa&s;ion a ri&s;e in the wages of labour proportionable to this ri&s;e of price.</P>
<P>IT is thus that a tax upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, operates ex|actly in the &s;ame manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The labourer, though he may pay it out of his hand; cannot, for any con&s;iderable time at lea&s;t, be properly &s;aid even to advance it. It mu&s;t always in the long-run be advanced to him by his imme|diate employer in the advanced rate of his wages. His employer, if he is a manufacturer, will charge upon the price of his goods this ri&s;e of wages, together with a profit; &s;o that the final payment of the tax, together with this over-charge, will fall upon the con&s;umer. If his employer is a farmer, the final payment, to|gether with a like over-charge, will fall upon the rent of the landlord.</P>
<P>IT is otherwi&s;e with taxes upon what I call luxuries; even upon tho&s;e of the poor. The ri&s;e in the price of the taxed commodities,
<PB N="485" REF="487">
will not nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion any ri&s;e in the wages of labour. A tax upon tobacco, for example, though a luxury of the poor as well as of the rich, will not rai&s;e wages. Though it is taxed in England at three times, and in France at fifteen times its original price, tho&s;e high duties &s;eem to have no effect upon the wages of labour. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the taxes upon tea and &s;ugar; which in England and Holland have become luxuries of the lowe&s;t ranks of people; and of tho&s;e upon chocolate, which in Spain is &s;aid to have become &s;o. The different taxes which in Great Britain have in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century been im|po&s;ed upon &s;pirituous liquors, are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have had any effect upon the wages of labour. The ri&s;e in the price of porten, occa&s;ioned by an additional tax of three &s;hillings upon the barrel of &s;trong beer, has not rai&s;ed the wages of common labour in London. The&s;e were about eighteen-pence and twenty-pence a day before the tax, and they are not more now.</P>
<P>THE high price of &s;uch commodities does not nece&s;&s;arily di|mini&s;h the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families. Upon the &s;ober and indu&s;trious poor, taxes upon &s;uch commodities act as &s;umptuary laws, and di&s;po&s;e them either to moderate, or to refrain altogether from the u&s;e of &s;uperfluities which they can no longer ea&s;ily afford. Their ability to bring up families, in con&s;equence of this forced frugality, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, is frequently, perhaps, increa&s;ed by the tax. It is the &s;ober and indu&s;trious poor who generally bring up the mo&s;t numerous families, and who principally &s;upply the demand for u&s;eful labour. All the poor indeed are not &s;ober and indu&s;trious, and the di&s;&s;olute and di&s;orderly might continue to indulge them|&s;elves in the u&s;e of &s;uch commodities after this ri&s;e of price in the &s;ame manner as before; without regarding the di&s;tre&s;s which this indulgence might bring upon their families. Such di&s;orderly per|&s;ons,
<PB N="486" REF="488">
however, &s;eldom rear up numerous families; their children generally peri&s;hing from neglect, mi&s;management, and the &s;canti|ne&s;s or unwhole&s;omene&s;s of their food. If by the &s;trength of their con&s;titution they &s;urvive the hard&s;hips to which the bad conduct of their parents expo&s;es them; yet the example of that bad conduct commonly corrupts their morals; &s;o that, in&s;tead of being u&s;eful to &s;ociety by their indu&s;try, they become public nui&s;ances by their vices and di&s;orders. Though the advanced price of the luxuries of the poor, therefore, might increa&s;e &s;omewhat the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch di&s;orderly families, and thereby dimini&s;h &s;ome|what their ability to bring up children; it would not probably dimini&s;h much the u&s;eful population of the country.</P>
<P>ANY ri&s;e in the average price of nece&s;&s;aries, unle&s;s it is com|pen&s;ated by a proportionable ri&s;e in the wages of labour, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h more or le&s;s the ability of the poor to bring up numerous families, and con&s;equently to &s;upply the demand for u&s;eful labour; whatever may be the &s;tate of that demand, whether increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining; or &s;uch as requires an in|crea&s;ing, &s;tationary, or declining, population.</P>
<P>TAXES upon luxuries have no tendency to rai&s;e the price of any other commodities except that of the commodities taxed. Taxes upon nece&s;&s;aries, by rai&s;ing the wages of labour, nece&s;&s;arily tend to rai&s;e the price of all manufactures, and con&s;equently to dimini&s;h the extent of their &s;ale and con&s;umption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the con&s;umers of the commodities taxed, without any retribution. They fall indifferently upon every &s;pecies of revenue, the wages of labour, the profits of &s;tock, and the rent of land. Taxes upon nece&s;&s;aries, &s;o far as they affect the labouring poor, are finally paid, partly by landlords in the dimi|ni&s;hed rent of their lands, and partly by rich con&s;umers, whether
<PB N="487" REF="489">
landlords or others, in the advanced price of manufactured goods; and always with a con&s;iderable over-charge. The advanced price of &s;uch manufactures as are real nece&s;&s;aries of life, and are de&s;tined for the con&s;umption of the poor, of coar&s;e woollens, for example, mu&s;t be compen&s;ated to the poor by a farther advancement of their wages. The middling and &s;uperior ranks of people, if they under|&s;tood their own intere&s;t, ought always to oppo&s;e all taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, as well as all direct taxes upon the wages of labour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether upon them&s;elves, and always with a con&s;iderable over|charge. They fall heavie&s;t upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in that of landlords, by the reduction of their rent; and in that of rich con&s;umers, by the increa&s;e of their ex|pence. The ob&s;ervation of Sir Mathew Decker, that certain taxes are in the price of certain goods &s;ometimes repeated and accumu|lated four or five times, is perfectly ju&s;t with regard to taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life. In the price of leather, for example, you mu&s;t pay, not only for the tax upon the leather of your own &s;hoes, but for a part of that upon tho&s;e of the &s;hoe-maker and the tanner. You mu&s;t pay too for the tax upon the &s;alt, upon the &s;oap, and upon the candles which tho&s;e workmen con&s;ume while employed in your &s;ervice, and for the tax upon the leather, which the &s;alt|maker, the &s;oap-maker, and the candle-maker con&s;ume while em|ployed in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>IN Great Britain, the principal taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life are tho&s;e upon the four commodities ju&s;t now mentioned, &s;alt, lea|ther, &s;oap, and candles.</P>
<P>SALT is a very antient and a very univer&s;al &s;ubject of taxation. It was taxed among the Romans, and it is &s;o at pre&s;ent in, I be|lieve, every part of Europe. The quantity annually con&s;umed by
<PB N="488" REF="490">
any individual is &s;o &s;mall, and may be purcha&s;ed &s;o gradually, that nobody, it &s;eems to have been thought, could feel very &s;en&s;ibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is in England taxed at three &s;hillings a bu&s;hel; about three times the original price of the com|modity. In &s;ome other countries the tax is &s;till higher. Leather is a real nece&s;&s;ary of life. The u&s;e of linen renders &s;oap &s;uch. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles are a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trument of trade. Leather and &s;oap are in Great Britain taxed at three halfpence a pound; candles at a penny; taxes which, upon the original price of leather may amount to about eight or ten per cent; upon that of &s;oap to about twenty or five and twenty per cent; and upon that of candles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent; taxes which, though lighter than that upon &s;alt, are &s;till very heavy. As all tho&s;e four commodities are real nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;uch heavy taxes upon them mu&s;t increa&s;e &s;omewhat the expence of the &s;ober and indu&s;trious poor, and mu&s;t con&s;equently rai&s;e more or le&s;s the wages of their labour.</P>
<P>IN a country where the winters are &s;o cold as in Great Britain, fuel is, during that &s;ea&s;on, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, a nece&s;&s;ary of life, not only for the purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing victuals, but for the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of many different &s;orts of workmen who work within doors; and coals are the cheape&s;t of all fuel. The price of fuel has &s;o important an influence upon that of labour, that all over Great Britain manufactures have confined them&s;elves principally to the coal countries; other parts of the country, on account of the high price of this nece&s;&s;ary article, not being able to work &s;o cheap. In &s;ome manufactures, be&s;ides, coal is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;trument of trade; as in tho&s;e of gla&s;s, iron, and all other metals. If a bounty could in any ca&s;e be rea&s;onable, it might per|haps be &s;o upon the tran&s;portation of coals from tho&s;e parts of the country in which they abound, to tho&s;e in which they are wanted.
<PB N="489" REF="491">
But the legi&s;lature, in&s;tead of a bounty, has impo&s;ed a tax of three &s;hillings and three-pence a ton upon coal carried coa&s;tways; which upon mo&s;t &s;orts of coal is more than &s;ixty per cent. of the original price at the coal-pit. Coals carried either by land or by inland navigation pay no duty. Where they are naturally cheap, they are con&s;umed duty free: Where they are naturally dear, they are loaded with a heavy duty.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes, though they rai&s;e the price of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and con|&s;equently the wages of labour, yet they afford a con&s;iderable reve|nue to government, which it might not be ea&s;y to find in any other way. There may, therefore, be good rea&s;ons for continuing them. The bounty upon the exportation of corn, &s;o far as it tends in the actual &s;tate of tillage to rai&s;e the price of that nece&s;&s;ary article, produces all the like bad effects; and in&s;tead of affording any reve|nue, frequently occa&s;ions a very great expence to government. The high duties upon the importation of foreign corn, which in years of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition; and the ab&s;o|lute prohibition of the importation either of live cattle or of &s;alt provi&s;ions, which takes place in the ordinary &s;tate of the law, and which on account of the &s;carcity is at pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pended for a limited time with regard to Ireland and the Briti&s;h plantations, have all the bad effects of taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and produce no revenue to government. Nothing &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for the repeal of &s;uch regulations, but to convince the public of the futility of that &s;y&s;tem in con&s;equence of which they have been e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>TAXES upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life are much higher in many other countries than in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground at the mill, and upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many countries. In Holland the money price of the bread con&s;umed in towns is &s;uppo&s;ed to be doubled by means of
<PB N="490" REF="492">
&s;uch taxes. In lieu of a part of them, the people who live in the country pay every year &s;o much a head, according to the &s;ort of bread they are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;ume. Tho&s;e who con&s;ume wheaten bread, pay three gilders fifteen &s;tivers; about &s;ix &s;hillings and nine-pence halfpenny. The&s;e, and &s;ome other taxes of the &s;ame kind, by rai&s;ing the price of labour, are &s;aid to have ruined the greater part of the manufactures of Holland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droits, &amp;c. p. 210,211.</NOTE>. Similar taxes, though not quite &s;o heavy, take place in the Milane&s;e, in the &s;tates of Genoa, in the dutchy of Modena, in the dutchies of Parma, Placentia, and Gua&s;talla, and in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. A French author <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le reformateur.</NOTE> of &s;ome note has propo&s;ed to reform the finances of his country, by &s;ub&s;tituting in the room of the greater part of other taxes this mo&s;t ruinous of all taxes. There is nothing &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;ays Cicero, which has not &s;ometimes been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>TAXES upon butchers meat are &s;till more common than tho&s;e upon bread. It may indeed be doubted whether butchers meat is any where a nece&s;&s;ary of life. Grain and other vegetables, with the help of milk, chee&s;e, and butter, or oil where butter is not to be had, it is known from experience, can, without any butchers meat, afford the mo&s;t plentiful, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, the mo&s;t nouri&s;h|ing, and the mo&s;t invigorating diet. Decency no where requires that any man &s;hould eat butchers meat, as it in mo&s;t places requires that he &s;hould wear a linen &s;hirt or a pair of leather &s;hoes.</P>
<P>CONSUMABLE commodities, whether nece&s;&s;aries or luxuries, may be taxed in two different ways. The con&s;umer may either pay an annual &s;um on account of his u&s;ing or con&s;uming goods of a certain kind; or the goods may be taxed while they remain in the hands of the dealer, and before they are delivered to the con&s;umer. The con&s;umable goods which la&s;t a con&s;iderable time before they are con&s;umed altogether, are mo&s;t properly taxed in the one way.
<PB N="491" REF="493">
Tho&s;e of which the con&s;umption is either immediate or more &s;peedy, in the other. The coach-tax and plate-tax are examples of the former method of impo&s;ing: The greater part of the other duties of exci&s;e and cu&s;toms, of the latter.</P>
<P>A COACH may, with good management, la&s;t ten or twelve years. It might be taxed, once for all, before it comes out of the hands of the coach-maker. But it is certainly more convenient for the buyer to pay four pounds a year for the privilege of keeping a coach, than to pay all at once forty or forty-eight pounds additional price to the coach-maker; or a &s;um equivalent to what the tax is likely to co&s;t him during the time he u&s;es the &s;ame coach. A &s;ervice of plate, in the &s;ame manner, may la&s;t more than a century. It is certainly ea&s;ier for the con&s;umer to pay five &s;hillings a year for every hundred ounces of plate, near one per cent. of the value, than to redeem this long annuity at five and twenty or thirty years pur|cha&s;e, which would enhance the price at lea&s;t five and twenty or thirty per cent. The different taxes which affect hou&s;es are cer|tainly more conveniently paid by moderate annual payments, than by a heavy tax of equal value upon the fir&s;t building or &s;ale of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was the well known propo&s;al of Sir Mathew Decker that all commodities, even tho&s;e of which the con&s;umption is either imme|diate or very &s;peedy, &s;hould be taxed in this manner; the dealer advancing nothing, but the con&s;umer paying a certain annual &s;um for the licence to con&s;ume certain goods. The object of his &s;cheme was to promote all the different branches of foreign trade, particu|larly the carrying trade, by taking away all duties upon importa|tion and exportation, and thereby enabling the merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purcha&s;e of goods and the freight of &s;hips, no part of either being diverted towards the
<PB N="492" REF="494">
advancing of taxes. The project, however, of taxing, in this man|ner, goods of immediate or &s;peedy con&s;umption, &s;eems liable to the four following very important objections. Fir&s;t, the tax would be more unequal, or not &s;o well proportioned to the expence and con&s;umption of the different contributors, as in the way in which it is commonly impo&s;ed. The taxes upon ale, wine, and &s;pirituous liquors, which are advanced by the dealers, are finally paid by the different con&s;umers exactly in proportion to their re&s;pective con&s;umption. But if the tax was to be paid by pur|cha&s;ing a licence to drink tho&s;e liquors, the &s;ober would, in propor|tion to his con&s;umption, be taxed much more heavily than the drunken con&s;umer. A family which exerci&s;ed great ho&s;pitality would be taxed much more lightly than one which entertained fewer gue&s;ts. Secondly, this mode of taxation, by paying for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to con&s;ume certain goods, would dimini&s;h very much one of the principal conveniencies of taxes upon goods of &s;peedy con&s;umption; the piece-meal payment. In the price of three-pence halfpenny, which is at pre&s;ent paid for a pot of porter, the different taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the extraordinary profit which the brewer charges for having advanced them, may perhaps amount to about three halfpence. If a work|man can conveniently &s;pare tho&s;e three halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he cannot, he contents him&s;elf with a pint, and, as a penny &s;aved is a penny got, he thus gains a farthing by his temperance. He pays the tax piece-meal, as he can afford to pay it, and when he can afford to pay it; and every act of payment is perfectly voluntary, and what he can avoid if he chu&s;es to do &s;o. Thirdly, &s;uch taxes would operate le&s;s as &s;umptuary laws. When the licence was once purcha&s;ed, whether the purcha&s;er drunk much or drunk little, his tax would be the &s;ame. Fourthly, if a workman was to pay all at once, by yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly payments, a tax equal to what he at pre&s;ent pays, with little or no inconveniency, upon all the diffe|rent
<PB N="493" REF="495">
pots and pints of porter which he drinks in any &s;uch period of time, the &s;um might frequently di&s;tre&s;s him very much. This mode of taxation, therefore, it &s;eems evident, could never, without the mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ion, produce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the pre&s;ent mode without any oppre&s;&s;ion. In &s;everal countries, however, commodities of an immediate or very &s;peedy con&s;umption are taxed in this manner. In Holland, people pay &s;o much a head for a licence to drink tea. I have already men|tioned a tax upon bread, which, &s;o far as it is con&s;umed in farm|hou&s;es and country villages, is there levied in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>THE duties of exci&s;e are impo&s;ed chiefly upon goods of home produce de&s;tined for home con&s;umption. They are impo&s;ed only upon a few &s;orts of goods of the mo&s;t general u&s;e. There can never be any doubt either concerning the goods which are &s;ub|ject to tho&s;e duties, or concerning the particular duty which each &s;pecies of goods is &s;ubject to. They fall almo&s;t altogether upon what I call luxuries, excepting always the four duties above|mentioned, upon &s;alt, &s;oap, leather, candles, and, perhaps, that upon green gla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE duties of cu&s;toms are much more antient than tho&s;e of exci&s;e. They &s;eem to have been called cu&s;toms, as denoting cu&s;|tomary payments which had been in u&s;e from time immemorial. They appear to have been originally con&s;idered as taxes upon the profits of merchants. During the barbarous times of feudal anar|chy, merchants, like all the other inhabitants of burghs, were con|&s;idered as little better than emancipated bondmen, who&s;e per&s;ons were de&s;pi&s;ed, and who&s;e gains were envied. The great nobility, who had con&s;ented that the king &s;hould tallage the profits of their own tenants, were not unwilling that he &s;hould tallage likewi&s;e: tho&s;e of an order of men whom it was much le&s;s their intere&s;t to
<PB N="494" REF="496">
protect. In tho&s;e ignorant times it was not under&s;tood that the profits of merchants are a &s;ubject not taxable directly; or that the final payment of all &s;uch taxes mu&s;t fall, with a con&s;iderable overcharge, upon the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>THE gains of alien merchants were looked upon more unfavour|ably than tho&s;e of Engli&s;h merchants. It was natural, therefore, that tho&s;e of the former &s;hould be taxed more heavily than tho&s;e of the latter. This di&s;tinction between the duties upon aliens and tho&s;e upon Engli&s;h merchants, which was begun from igno|rance, has been continued from the &s;pirit of monopoly, or in order to give our own merchants an advantage both in the home and in the foreign market.</P>
<P>WITH this di&s;tinction the antient duties of cu&s;toms were im|po&s;ed equally upon all &s;orts of goods, nece&s;&s;aries as well as luxuries, goods exported as well as goods imported. Why &s;hould the dealers in one &s;ort of goods, it &s;eems to have been thought, be more favoured than tho&s;e in another? or why &s;hould the merchant exporter be more favoured than the merchant importer?</P>
<P>THE antient cu&s;toms were divided into three branches. The fir&s;t, and perhaps the mo&s;t antient of all tho&s;e duties, was that upon wool and leather. It &s;eems to have been chiefly or alto|gether an exportation duty. When the woollen manufacture came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, le&s;t the king &s;hould lo&s;e any part of his cu&s;toms upon wool by the exportation of woollen cloths, a like duty was impo&s;ed upon them. The other two branches were, fir&s;t, a duty upon wine, which being impo&s;ed at &s;o much a ton, was called a tonnage; and, &s;econdly, a duty upon all other goods, which being impo&s;ed at &s;o much a pound of their &s;uppo&s;ed value, was called a poundage. In the forty-&s;eventh year of Edward III.
<PB N="495" REF="497">
a duty of &s;ix-pence in the pound was impo&s;ed upon all goods exported and imported, except wools, wool-fells, leather, and wines, which were &s;ubject to particular duties. In the fourteenth of Richard II. this duty was rai&s;ed to one &s;hilling in the pound; but, three years afterwards, it was again reduced to &s;ix-pence. It was rai&s;ed to eight-pence in the &s;econd year of Henry IV.; and in the fourth year of the &s;ame prince, to one &s;hilling. From this time to the ninth year of William III. this duty continued at one &s;hilling in the pound. The duties of tonnage and poundage were generally granted to the king by one and the &s;ame act of parliament, and were called the Sub&s;idy of Tonnage and Poundage. The &s;ub&s;idy of poundage having continued for &s;o long a time at one &s;hilling in the pound, or at five per cent.; a &s;ub&s;idy came, in the language of the cu&s;toms, to denote a general duty of this kind of five per cent. This &s;ub&s;idy, which is now called the Old Sub&s;idy, &s;till continues to be levied according to the book of rates e&s;tabli&s;hed in the twelfth of Charles II. The method of a&s;certaining, by a book of rates, the value of goods &s;ubject to this duty, is &s;aid to be older than the time of James I. The new &s;ub&s;idy impo&s;ed by the ninth and tenth of William III., was an additional five per cent. upon the greater part of goods. The one-third and the two-third &s;ub&s;idy made up be|tween them another five per cent. of which they were proportion|able parts. The &s;ub&s;idy of 1747 made a fourth five per cent. upon the greater part of goods; and that of 1759, a fifth upon &s;ome particular &s;orts of goods. Be&s;ides tho&s;e five &s;ub&s;idies, a great variety of other duties have occa&s;ionally been impo&s;ed upon parti|cular &s;orts of goods, in order &s;ometimes to relieve the exigencies of the &s;tate, and &s;ometimes to regulate the trade of the country, accord|ing to the principles of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THAT &s;y&s;tem has come gradually more and more into fa&s;hion. The old &s;ub&s;idy was impo&s;ed indifferently upon exportation as well
<PB N="496" REF="498">
as importation. The four &s;ub&s;equent &s;ub&s;idies, as well as the other duties which have &s;ince been occa&s;ionally impo&s;ed upon particular &s;orts of goods, have, with a few exceptions, been laid altogether upon importation. The greater part of the antient duties which had been impo&s;ed upon the exportation of the goods of home produce and manufacture, have either been lightened or taken away alto|gether. In mo&s;t ca&s;es they have been taken away. Bounties have even been given upon the exportation of &s;ome of them. Draw|backs too, &s;ometimes of the whole, and, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, of a part of the duties which are paid upon the importation of foreign goods, have been granted upon their exportation. Only half the duties impo&s;ed by the old &s;ub&s;idy upon importation are drawn back upon exportation: but the whole of tho&s;e impo&s;ed by the later &s;ub&s;idies and other impo&s;ts are, upon the greater part of goods, drawn back in the &s;ame manner. This growing favour of exportation, and di&s;couragement of importation, have &s;uffered only a few exceptions, which chiefly concern the materials of &s;ome manufactures. The&s;e our merchants and manufacturers are willing &s;hould come as cheap as po&s;&s;ible to them&s;elves, and as dear as po&s;&s;ible to their rivals and competitors in other countries. Foreign materials are, upon this account, &s;ometimes allowed to be imported duty free; Spani&s;h wool, for example, flax, and raw linen yarn. The exportation of the materials of home produce, and of tho&s;e which are the pecu|liar produce of our colonies, has &s;ometimes been prohibited, and &s;ometimes &s;ubjected to higher duties. The exportation of Engli&s;h wool has been prohibited. That of beaver &s;kins, of beaver wool, and of gum Senega, has been &s;ubjected to higher duties; Great Britain, by the conque&s;t of Canada and Senegal, having got almo&s;t the monopoly of tho&s;e commodities.</P>
<P>THAT the mercantile &s;y&s;tem has not been very favourable to the revenue of the great body of the people, to the annual pro|duce
<PB N="497" REF="499">
of the land and labour of the country, I have endeavoured to &s;hew in the fourth book of this inquiry. It &s;eems not to have been more favourable to the revenue of the &s;overeign; &s;o far at lea&s;t as that revenue depends upon the duties of cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of that &s;y&s;tem, the importation of &s;everal &s;orts of goods has been prohibited altogether. This prohibition has in &s;ome ca&s;es entirely prevented, and in others very much dimi|ni&s;hed the importation of tho&s;e commodities, by reducing the importers to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;muggling. It has entirely prevented the importation of foreign woollens; and it has very much di|mini&s;hed that of foreign &s;ilks and velvets. In both ca&s;es it has entirely annihilated the revenue of cu&s;toms which might have been levied upon &s;uch importation.</P>
<P>THE high duties which have been impo&s;ed upon the importa|tion of many different &s;orts of foreign goods, in order to di&s;|courage their con&s;umption in Great Britain, have in many ca&s;es &s;erved only to encourage &s;muggling; and in all ca&s;es have reduced the revenue of the cu&s;toms below what more moderate duties would have afforded. The &s;aying of Dr. Swift, that in the arithmetic of the cu&s;toms two and two, in&s;tead of making four, make &s;ometimes only one, holds perfectly true with regard to &s;uch heavy duties, which never could have been impo&s;ed had not the mercantile &s;y&s;tem taught us in many ca&s;es to employ taxation as an in&s;tru|ment, not of revenue, but of monopoly.</P>
<P>THE bounties which are &s;ometimes given upon the exporta|tion of home produce and manufactures, and the drawbacks which are paid upon the re-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given occa&s;ion to many frauds, and to a &s;pecies of &s;muggling more de&s;tructive of the public revenue than
<PB N="498" REF="500">
any other. In order to obtain the bounty or drawback, the goods, it is well known, are &s;ometimes &s;hipped and &s;ent to &s;ea; but &s;oon afterwards clande&s;tinely re-landed in &s;ome other part of the country. The defalcation of the revenue of cu&s;toms occa|&s;ioned by bounties and drawbacks, of which a great part are obtained fraudulently, is very great. The gro&s;s produce of the cu&s;toms in the year which ended on the 5th of January, 1755, amounted to 5,068,000l. The bounties which were paid out of this revenue, though in that year there was no bounty upon corn, amounted to 167,800l. The drawbacks which were paid upon debentures and certificates to 2,156,800l. Bounties and drawbacks together amounted to 2,324,600l. In con&s;equence of the&s;e deductions the revenue of the cu&s;toms amounted only to 2,743,400l.: from which deducting 287,900l. for the expence of management in &s;alaries and other incidents, the neat revenue of the cu&s;toms for that year comes out to be 2,455,500l. The expence of management amounts, in this manner, to between five and &s;ix per cent. upon the gro&s;s revenue of the cu&s;toms, and to &s;omething more than ten per cent. upon what remains of that revenue, after deducting what is paid away in bounties and drawbacks.</P>
<P>HEAVY duties being impo&s;ed upon almo&s;t all goods imported, our merchant importers &s;muggle as much, and make entry of as little as they can. Our merchant exporters, on the contrary, make entry of more than they export; &s;ometimes out of vanity, and to pa&s;s for great dealers in goods which pay no duty; and &s;ometimes to gain a bounty or a drawback. Our exports, in con&s;equence of the&s;e different frauds, appear upon the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e books greatly to overbalance our imports; to the un&s;peak|able comfort of tho&s;e politicians who mea&s;ure the national pro&s;|perity by what they call the balance of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="501">
ALL goods imported, unle&s;s particularly exempted, and &s;uch exemptions are not very numerous, are liable to &s;ome duties of cu&s;toms. If any goods are imported not mentioned in the book of rates, they are taxed at 4s. 9d. 9/20 for every twenty &s;hillings value, according to the oath of the importer, that is, nearly at five &s;ub&s;idies, or five poundage duties. The book of rates is extremely comprehen&s;ive, and enumerates a great variety of arti|cles, many of them little u&s;ed, and therefore not well known. It is upon this account frequently uncertain under what article a particular &s;ort of goods ought to be cla&s;&s;ed, and con&s;equently what duty they ought to pay. Mi&s;takes with regard to this &s;ometimes ruin the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer, and frequently occa&s;ion much trouble, expence and vexation to the importer. In point of per&s;picuity, preci&s;ion and di&s;tinctne&s;s, therefore, the duties of cu&s;toms are much inferior to tho&s;e of exci&s;e.</P>
<P>IN order that the greater part of the members of any &s;ociety &s;hould contribute to the public revenue in proportion to their re&s;pective expence, it does not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary that every &s;ingle article of that expence &s;hould be taxed. The revenue which is levied by the duties of exci&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to fall as equally upon the contributors as that which is levied by the duties of cu&s;toms; and the duties of exci&s;e are impo&s;ed upon a few articles only of the mo&s;t general u&s;e and con&s;umption. It has been the opinion of many people that, by proper management, the duties of cu&s;|toms might likewi&s;e, without any lo&s;s to the public revenue, and with great advantage to foreign trade, be confined to a few articles only.</P>
<P>THE foreign articles of the mo&s;t general u&s;e and con&s;umption in Great Britain, &s;eem at pre&s;ent to con&s;i&s;t chiefly in foreign wines and brandies; in &s;ome of the productions of America and the We&s;t Indies, &s;ugar, rum, tobacco, cacao-nuts, &amp;c. and in
<PB N="500" REF="502">
&s;ome of tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t Indies, tea, coffee, china-ware, &s;piceries of all kinds, &s;everal &s;orts of piece goods, &amp;c. The&s;e different articles afford perhaps at pre&s;ent the greater part of the revenue which is drawn from the duties of cu&s;toms. The taxes which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon foreign manufactures, if you except tho&s;e upon the few contained in the foregoing enumeration, have the greater part of them been impo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, not of re|venue, but of monopoly, or to give our own merchants an advantage in the home market. By removing all prohibitions, and by &s;ubjecting all foreign manufactures to &s;uch moderate taxes as it was found from experience afforded upon each article the greate&s;t revenue to the public, our own workmen might &s;till have a con&s;iderable advantage in the home market, and many arti|cles, &s;ome of which at pre&s;ent afford no revenue to government, and others a very incon&s;iderable one, might afford a very great one.</P>
<P>HIGH taxes, &s;ometimes by dimini&s;hing the con&s;umption of the taxed commodities, and &s;ometimes by encouraging &s;muggling, frequently afford a &s;maller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more moderate taxes.</P>
<P>WHEN the diminution of revenue is the effect of the diminu|tion of con&s;umption, there can be but one remedy, and that is the lowering of the tax.</P>
<P>WHEN the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encou|ragement given to &s;muggling, it may perhaps be remedied in two ways; either by dimini&s;hing the temptation to &s;muggle, or by increa&s;ing the difficulty of &s;muggling. The temptation to &s;muggle can be dimini&s;hed only by the lowering of the tax; and the difficulty of &s;muggling can be increa&s;ed only by e&s;tabli&s;hing that &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration which is mo&s;t proper for prevent|ing it.</P>
<P><PB N="501" REF="503">
THE exci&s;e laws, it appears, I believe, from experience, ob|&s;truct and embarra&s;s the operations of the &s;muggler much more effectually than tho&s;e of the cu&s;toms. By introducing into the cu&s;toms a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration as &s;imilar to that of the exci&s;e as the nature of the different duties will admit, the difficulty of &s;muggling might be very much increa&s;ed. This alteration, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed by many people, might very ea&s;ily be brought about.</P>
<P>THE importer of commodities liable to any duties of cu&s;toms, it has been &s;aid, might at his option be allowed either to carry them to his own private warehou&s;e, or to lodge them in a warehou&s;e provided either at his own expence or at that of the public, but under the key of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e officer, and never to be opened but in his pre&s;ence. If the merchant carried them to his own private warehou&s;e, the duties to be immediately paid, and never afterwards to be drawn back; and that warehou&s;e to be at all times &s;ubject to the vi&s;it and examination of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e officer, in order to a&s;certain how far the quantity contained in it corre&s;ponded with that for which the duty had been paid. If he carried them to the public warehou&s;e, no duty to be paid till they were taken out for home con&s;umption. If taken out for exportation, to be duty-free; proper &s;ecurity being always given that they &s;hould be &s;o exported. The dealers in tho&s;e particular commodities, either by whole&s;ale or retail, to be at all times &s;ubject to the vi&s;it and examination of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e officer; and to be obliged to ju&s;tify by proper certificates the payment of the duty upon the whole quantity contained in their &s;hops or warehou&s;es. What are called the exci&s;e duties upon rum im|ported are at pre&s;ent levied in this manner, and the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration might perhaps be extended to all duties upon goods imported; provided always, that tho&s;e duties were, like the duties of exci&s;e, confined to a few &s;orts of goods of the mo&s;t
<PB N="502" REF="504">
general u&s;e and con&s;umption. If they were extended to almo&s;t all &s;orts of goods, as at pre&s;ent, public warehou&s;es of &s;ufficient extent could not ea&s;ily be provided, and goods of a very delicate nature, or of which the pre&s;ervation required much care and attention, could not &s;afely be tru&s;ted by the merchant in any warehou&s;e but his own.</P>
<P>IF by &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration &s;muggling to any con|&s;iderable extent could be prevented even under pretty high duties, and if every duty was occa&s;ionally either heightened or lowered according as it was mo&s;t likely, either the one way or the other, to afford the greate&s;t revenue to the &s;tate; taxation being always employed as an in&s;trument of revenue and never of monopoly; it &s;eems not improbable that a revenue at lea&s;t equal to the pre&s;ent neat revenue of the cu&s;toms might be drawn from duties upon the importation of only a few &s;orts of goods of the mo&s;t general u&s;e and con&s;umption; and that the duties of cu&s;toms might thus be brought to the &s;ame degree of &s;implicity, certainty and preci&s;ion, as tho&s;e of exci&s;e. What the revenue at pre&s;ent lo&s;es by drawbacks upon the re-exportation of foreign goods which are afterwards re-landed and con&s;umed at home, would under this &s;y&s;tem be &s;aved altogether. If to this &s;aving, which would alone be very con&s;iderable, was added the abolition of all bounties upon the exportation of home-produce, in all ca&s;es in which tho&s;e bounties were not in reality drawbacks of &s;ome duties of exci&s;e which had before been advanced; it cannot well be doubted but that the neat revenue of cu&s;toms might after an alteration of this kind be fully equal to what it had ever been before.</P>
<P>IF by &s;uch a change of &s;y&s;tem the public revenue &s;uffered no lo&s;s; the trade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very con&s;iderable advantage. The trade in the commodities
<PB N="503" REF="505">
not taxed, by far the greate&s;t number, would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to and from all parts of the world with every po&s;&s;ible advantage. Among tho&s;e commodities would be comprehended all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and all the materials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the nece&s;&s;aries of life reduced their average money price in the home-market, it would reduce the money price of labour, but without reducing in any re&s;pect its real recompence. The value of money is in proportion to the quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries of life which it will purcha&s;e. That of the nece&s;&s;aries of life is altogether independant of the quantity of money which can be had for them. The re|duction in the money price of labour would nece&s;&s;arily be attended with a proportionable one in that of all home-manufactures, which would thereby gain &s;ome advantage in all foreign markets. The price of &s;ome manufactures would be reduced in a &s;till greater proportion by the free importation of the raw materials. If raw &s;ilk could be imported from China and Indo&s;tan duty-free, the &s;ilk manufacturers in England could greatly under&s;ell tho&s;e of both France and Italy. There would be no occa&s;ion to prohibit the importation of foreign &s;ilks and velvets. The cheapne&s;s of their goods would &s;ecure to our own workmen, not only the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the home, but a very great command of the foreign market. Even the trade in the commodities taxed would be carried on with much more advantage than at pre&s;ent. If tho&s;e commodities were delivered out of the public warehou&s;e for foreign exportation, being in this ca&s;e exempted from all taxes, the trade in them would be perfectly free. The carrying trade in all &s;orts of goods would under this &s;y&s;tem enjoy every po&s;&s;ible advantage. If tho&s;e commodities were delivered out for home-con&s;umption, the im|porter not being obliged to advance the tax till he had an oppor|tunity of &s;elling his goods either to &s;ome dealer, or to &s;ome con|&s;umer, he could always afford to &s;ell them cheaper than if he had
<PB N="504" REF="506">
been obliged to advance it at the moment of importation. Under the &s;ame taxes, the foreign trade of con&s;umption even in the taxed commodities, might in this manner be carried on with much more advantage than it can at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IT was the object of the famous exci&s;e &s;cheme of Sir Robert Walpole to e&s;tabli&s;h, with regard to wine and tobacco, a &s;y&s;tem not very unlike that which is here propo&s;ed. But though the bill which was then brought into parliament, comprehended tho&s;e two commodities only; it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be meant as an introduction to a more exten&s;ive &s;cheme of the &s;ame kind. Faction, combined with the intere&s;t of &s;muggling merchants, rai&s;ed &s;o violent, though &s;o unju&s;t, a clamour again&s;t that bill, that the mini&s;ter thought proper to drop it; and from a dread of exciting a clamour of the &s;ame kind, none of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have dared to re&s;ume the project.</P>
<P>THE duties upon foreign luxuries imported for home-con&s;ump|tion, though they &s;ometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of middling or more than middling fortune. Such are, for example, the duties upon foreign wines, upon coffee, chocolate, tea, &s;ugar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home-produce de|&s;tined for home-con&s;umption, fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks in proportion to their re&s;pective expence. The poor pay the duties upon malt, hops, beer, and ale, upon their own con|&s;umption: The rich, both upon their own con&s;umption and upon that of their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>THE whole con&s;umption of the inferior ranks of people, or of tho&s;e below the middling rank, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, is in every
<PB N="505" REF="507">
country much greater, not only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling and of tho&s;e above the middling rank. The whole expence of the inferior is much greater than that of the &s;uperior ranks. In the fir&s;t place, almo&s;t the whole capital of every country is annually di&s;tributed among the inferior ranks of people as the wages of productive labour. Secondly, a great part of the revenue ari&s;ing both from the rent of land and from the profits of &s;tock, is annually di&s;tributed among the &s;ame rank, in the wages and maintenance of menial &s;ervants, and other unproduc|tive labourers. Thirdly, &s;ome part of the profits of &s;tock belongs to the &s;ame rank, as a revenue ari&s;ing from the employment of their &s;mall capitals. The amount of the profits annually made by &s;mall &s;hopkeepers, trade&s;men, and retailers of all kinds, is every where very con&s;iderable, and makes a very con&s;iderable portion of the annual produce. Fourthly, and la&s;tly, &s;ome part even of the rent of land belongs to the &s;ame rank; a con&s;iderable part to tho&s;e who are &s;omewhat below the middling rank, and a &s;mall part even to the lowe&s;t rank; common labourers &s;ometimes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing in property an acre or two of land. Though the expence of tho&s;e inferior ranks of people, therefore, taking them indi|vidually, is very &s;mall, yet the whole ma&s;s of it, taking them collectively, amounts always to by much the large&s;t portion of the whole expence of the &s;ociety; what remains of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country for the con&s;umption of the &s;uperior ranks being always much le&s;s, not only in quantity but in value. The taxes upon expence, therefore, which fall chiefly upon that of the &s;uperior ranks of people, upon the &s;maller portion of the annual produce, are likely to be much le&s;s pro|ductive than either tho&s;e which fall indifferently upon the expence of all ranks, or even tho&s;e which fall chiefly upon that of the inferior ranks; than either tho&s;e which fall indifferently upon the whole annual produce, or tho&s;e which fall chiefly upon the larger por|tion
<PB N="506" REF="508">
of it. The exci&s;e upon the materials and manufacture of home-made fermented and &s;pirituous liquors is accordingly, of all the different taxes upon expence, by far the mo&s;t productive; and this branch of the exci&s;e falls very much, perhaps principally, upon the expence of the common people. In the year which ended on the 5th of July, 1775, the gro&s;s produce of this branch of the exci&s;e amounted to 3,314,223l. 18 s. 10&frac34;d.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t always be remembered, however, that it is the luxurious and not the nece&s;&s;ary expence of the inferior ranks of people that ought ever to be taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their nece&s;&s;ary expence would fall altogether upon the &s;uperior ranks of people; upon the &s;maller portion of the annual produce, and not upon the greater. Such a tax mu&s;t in all ca&s;es either rai&s;e the wages of labour, or le&s;&s;en the demand for it. It could not rai&s;e the wages of labour, without throwing the final payment of the tax upon the &s;uperior ranks of people. It could not le&s;&s;en the de|mand for labour, without le&s;&s;ening the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, the fund from which all taxes mu&s;t be finally paid. Whatever might be the &s;tate to which a tax of this kind reduced the demand for labour, it mu&s;t always rai&s;e wages higher than they otherwi&s;e would be in that &s;tate; and the final payment of this enhancement of wages mu&s;t in all ca&s;es fall upon the &s;uperior ranks of people.</P>
<P>FERMENTED liquors brewed and &s;pirituous liquors di&s;tilled, not for &s;ale, but for private u&s;e, are not in Great Britain liable to any duties of exci&s;e. This exemption, of which the object is not to expo&s;e private families to the odious vi&s;it and examination of the tax-gatherer, occa&s;ions the burden of tho&s;e duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich than upon the poor. It is not, indeed, very common to di&s;till for private u&s;e, though it is
<PB N="507" REF="509">
done &s;ometimes. But in the country, many middling and almo&s;t all rich and great families brew their own beer. Their &s;trong beer, therefore, co&s;ts them eight &s;hillings a barrel le&s;s than it co&s;ts the common brewer, who mu&s;t have his profit upon the tax, as well as upon all the other expence which he advances. Such families, therefore, mu&s;t drink their beer at lea&s;t nine or ten &s;hillings a barrel cheaper than any liquor of the &s;ame quality can be drunk by the common people, to whom it is every where more convenient to buy their beer, by little and little, from the brewery or the ale-hou&s;e. Malt, in the &s;ame manner, that is made for the u&s;e of a private family, is not liable to the vi&s;it or examination of the tax-gatherer; but in this ca&s;e the family mu&s;t compound at &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence a head for the tax. Seven &s;hillings and &s;ixpence are equal to the exci&s;e upon ten bu&s;hels of malt; a quantity fully equal to what all the different members of any &s;ober family, men, women, and children, are at an average likely to con&s;ume. But in rich and great families, where country ho&s;pitality is much practi&s;ed, the malt liquors con&s;umed by the members of the family make but a &s;mall part of the con&s;umption of the hou&s;e. Either on account of this compo&s;ition, however, or for other rea&s;ons, it is not near &s;o common to malt as to brew for private u&s;e. It is difficult to imagine any equitable rea&s;on why tho&s;e who either brew or di&s;till for private u&s;e, &s;hould not be &s;ubject to a compo&s;ition of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>A GREATER revenue than what is at pre&s;ent drawn from all the heavy taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, might be rai&s;ed, it has frequently been &s;aid, by a much lighter tax upon malt; the opportunities of defrauding the revenue being much greater in a brewery than in a malt-hou&s;e; and tho&s;e who brew for private u&s;e being exempted from all duties or compo&s;ition for duties, which is not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who malt for private u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="510">
IN the porter brewery of London, a quarter of malt is com|monly brewed into more than two barrels and a half, &s;ometimes into three barrels of porter. The different taxes upon malt amount to &s;ix &s;hillings a quarter; tho&s;e upon &s;trong beer and ale to eight &s;hillings a barrel. In the porter brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, amount to between twenty-&s;ix and thirty &s;hillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt. In the country brewery for common country &s;ale, a quarter of malt is &s;eldom brewed into le&s;s than two barrels of &s;trong and one barrel of &s;mall beer; frequently into two barrels and a half of &s;trong beer. The different taxes upon &s;mall beer amount to one &s;hilling and four-pence a barrel. In the country brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, &s;eldom amount to le&s;s than twenty-three &s;hillings and four-pence, frequently to twenty-&s;ix &s;hillings, upon the produce of a quarter of malt. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, therefore, the whole amount of the duties upon malt, beer, and ale, cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than twenty-four or twenty-five &s;hillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt. But by taking off all the different duties upon beer and ale, and by tripling the malt-tax, or by rai&s;ing it from &s;ix to eighteen &s;hillings upon the quarter of malt, a greater revenue, it is &s;aid, might be rai&s;ed by this &s;ingle tax than what is at pre&s;ent drawn from all tho&s;e heavier taxes.

UNDER the old malt tax, indeed, is comprehended a tax of four &s;hillings upon the hog&s;head of cyder, and another of ten &s;hillings upon the barrel of mum. In 1774, the tax upon cyder produced only 3083 l. 6 s. 8 d. It probably fell &s;omewhat &s;hort of its u&s;ual amount; all the different taxes upon cyder having that year pro|duced le&s;s than ordinary. The tax upon mum, though much heavier, is &s;till le&s;s productive, on account of the &s;maller con|&s;umption of that liquor. But to balance whatever may be the ordinary amount of tho&s;e two taxes; there is comprehended under what is called The country exci&s;e, fir&s;t, the old exci&s;e of &s;ix &s;hil|lings and eight-pence upon the hog&s;head of cyder; &s;econdly, a like tax of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence upon the hog&s;head of verjuice; thirdly, another of eight &s;hillings and nine-pence upon the hog&s;head of vinegar; and, la&s;tly, a fourth tax of eleven|pence upon the gallon of mead or metheglin: The produce of tho&s;e different taxes will probably much more than counter|balance that of the duties impo&s;ed, by what is called The annual malt tax, upon cyder and mum.</P>
<P>MALT is con&s;umed not only in the brewery of beer and ale, but in the manufacture of low wines and &s;pirits. If the malt tax was to be rai&s;ed to eighteen &s;hillings upon the quarter, it might be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome abatement in the different ex|ci&s;es which are impo&s;ed upon tho&s;e particular &s;orts of low wines and &s;pirits of which malt makes any part of the materials. In what are called Malt &s;pirits, it makes commonly but a third part of the materials; the other two-thirds being either raw barley, or one-third barley and one-third wheat. In the di&s;tillery of malt &s;pirits, both the opportunity, and the temptation to &s;muggle, are much greater than either in a brewery or in a malt-hou&s;e; the opportunity, on account of the &s;maller bulk and greater value of the commodity; and the temptation, on account of the &s;uperior
<PB N="511" REF="513">
height of the duties, which amount to 2 s. 6 d. upon the gallon of &s;pirits. By increa&s;ing the duties upon malt, and reducing tho&s;e upon the di&s;tillery, both the opportunities and the temptation to &s;muggle would be dimini&s;hed, which might occa&s;ion a &s;till further augmentation of revenue.</P>
<P>IT has for &s;ome time pa&s;t been the policy of Great Britain to di&s;courage the con&s;umption of &s;pirituous liquors, on account of their &s;uppo&s;ed tendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common people. According to this policy, the abatement of the taxes upon the di&s;tillery ought not to be &s;o great as to reduce in any re&s;pect the price of tho&s;e liquors. Spirituous liquors might remain as dear as ever; while at the &s;ame time the whole&s;ome and invigorating liquors of beer and ale might be con|&s;iderably reduced in their price. The people might thus be in part relieved from one of the burdens of which they at pre&s;ent complain the mo&s;t; while at the &s;ame time the revenue might be con&s;iderably augmented.</P>
<P>THE objections of Doctor Davenant to this alteration in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of exci&s;e duties, &s;eem to be without foundation. Tho&s;e objections are, that the tax, in&s;tead of dividing it&s;elf as at pre&s;ent pretty equally upon the profit of the malt&s;ter, upon that of the brewer, and upon that of the retailer, would, &s;o far as it affected profit, fall altogether upon that of the malt&s;ter; that the malt&s;ter could not &s;o ea&s;ily get back the amount of the tax in the advanced price of his malt, as the brewer and retailer in the ad|vanced price of their liquor; and that &s;o heavy a tax upon malt might reduce the rent and profit of barley land.</P>
<P>NO tax can ever reduce, for any con&s;iderable time, the rate of profit in any particular trade, which mu&s;t always keep its level
<PB N="512" REF="514">
with other trades in the neighbourhood. The pre&s;ent duties upon malt, beer, and ale, do not affect the profits of the dealers in tho&s;e commodities, who all get back the tax with an additional profit, in the enhanced price of their goods. A tax indeed may render the goods upon which it is impo&s;ed &s;o dear as to dimini&s;h the con|&s;umption of them. But the con&s;umption of malt is in malt liquors; and a tax of eighteen &s;hillings upon the quarter of malt could not well render tho&s;e liquors dearer than the different taxes, amounting to twenty-four or twenty-five &s;hillings, do at pre&s;ent. Tho&s;e liquors, on the contrary, would probably become cheaper, and the con&s;umption of them would be more likely to increa&s;e than to dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>IT is not very ea&s;y to under&s;tand why it &s;hould be more difficult for the malt&s;ter to get back eighteen &s;hillings in the advanced price of his malt, than it is at pre&s;ent for the brewer to get back twenty-four or twenty-five, &s;ometimes thirty &s;hillings, in that of his liquor. The malt&s;ter, indeed, in&s;tead of a tax of &s;ix &s;hillings, would be obliged to advance one of eighteen &s;hillings upon every quarter of malt. But the brewer is at pre&s;ent obliged to advance a tax of twenty-four or twenty-five, &s;ometimes thirty &s;hillings, upon every quarter of malt which he brews. It could not be more inconvenient for the malt&s;ter to advance a lighter tax, than it is at pre&s;ent for the brewer to advance a heavier one. The malt&s;ter doth not always keep in his granaries a &s;tock of malt which it will require a longer time to di&s;po&s;e of, than the &s;tock of beer and ale which the brewer frequently keeps in his cellars. The former, therefore, may fre|quently get the returns of his money as &s;oon as the latter. But whatever inconveniency might ari&s;e to the malt&s;ter from being obliged to advance a heavier tax, could ea&s;ily be remedied by granting him a few months longer credit than is at pre&s;ent com|monly given to the brewer.</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="515">
NOTHING could reduce the rent and profit of barley land which did not reduce the demand for barley. But a change of &s;y&s;tem which reduced the duties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale from twenty-four and twenty-five &s;hillings to eighteen &s;hillings, would be more likely to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h that demand. The rent and profit of barley land, be&s;ides, mu&s;t always be nearly equal to tho&s;e of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land. If they were le&s;s, &s;ome part of the barley land would &s;oon be turned to &s;ome other purpo&s;e; and if they were greater, more land would &s;oon be turned to the rai&s;ing of barley. When the ordinary price of any particular produce of land is at what may be called a monopoly price, a tax upon it nece&s;&s;arily reduces the rent and profit of the land which grows it. A tax upon the produce of tho&s;e precious vineyards, of which the wine falls &s;o much &s;hort of the effectual demand, that its price is always above the natural proportion to that of the produce of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land, would nece&s;&s;arily reduce the rent and profit of tho&s;e vineyards. The price of the wines, being already the highe&s;t that could be got for the quantity com|monly &s;ent to market, it could not be rai&s;ed higher without dimi|ni&s;hing that quantity; and the quantity could not be dimini&s;hed without &s;till greater lo&s;s, becau&s;e the lands could not be turned to any other equally valuable produce. The whole weight of the tax, therefore, would fall upon the rent and profit; properly upon the rent of the vineyard. When it has been propo&s;ed to lay any new tax upon &s;ugar, our &s;ugar planters have frequently complained that the whole weight of &s;uch taxes fell, not upon the con&s;umer, but upon the producer; they never having been able to rai&s;e the price of their &s;ugar after the tax higher than it was before. The price had, it &s;eems, before the tax been a monopoly price; and the argument adduced to &s;how that &s;ugar was an improper &s;ubject of taxation, demon&s;trated perhaps that it was a proper one; the gains of monopoli&s;ts, whenever they can be come at, being cer|tainly
<PB N="514" REF="516">
of all &s;ubjects the mo&s;t proper. But the ordinary price of barley has never been a monopoly price; and the rent and profit of barley land have never been above their natural proportion to tho&s;e of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land. The different taxes which have been impo&s;ed upon malt, beer, and ale, have never lowered the price of barley, have never re|duced the rent and profit of barley land. The price of malt to the brewer has con&s;tantly ri&s;en in proportion to the taxes im|po&s;ed upon it; and tho&s;e taxes, together with the different du|ties upon beer and ale, have con&s;tantly either rai&s;ed the price, or what comes to the &s;ame thing, reduced the quality of tho&s;e commodities to the con&s;umer. The final payment of tho&s;e taxes has fallen con&s;tantly upon the con&s;umer, and not upon the pro|ducer.</P>
<P>THE only people likely to &s;uffer by the change of &s;y&s;tem here propo&s;ed, are tho&s;e who brew for their own private u&s;e. But the exemption which this &s;uperior rank of people at pre&s;ent enjoy from very heavy taxes which are paid by the poor labourer and artificer, is &s;urely mo&s;t unju&s;t and unequal, and ought to be taken away, even though this change was never to take place. It has probably been the intere&s;t of this &s;uperior order of people, however, which has hitherto prevented a change of &s;y&s;tem that could not well fail both to increa&s;e the revenue and to relieve the people.</P>
<P>BESIDES &s;uch duties as tho&s;e of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e above-men|tioned, there are &s;everal others which affect the price of goods more unequally and more indirectly. Of this kind are the duties which in French are called Peages, which in old Saxon times were called duties of Pa&s;&s;age, and which &s;eem to have been originally e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e as our turnpike tolls or the tolls upon our canals and navigable rivers; for the maintenance of the road or of the navigation. Tho&s;e duties, when applied to &s;uch purpo&s;es, are
<PB N="515" REF="517">
mo&s;t properly impo&s;ed according to the bulk or weight of the goods. As they were originally local and provincial duties, appli|cable to local and provincial purpo&s;es, the admini&s;tration of them was in mo&s;t ca&s;es entru&s;ted to the particular town, pari&s;h, or lord|&s;hip, in which they were levied; &s;uch communities being in &s;ome way or other &s;uppo&s;ed to be accountable for the application. The &s;overeign, who is altogether unaccountable, has in many countries a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the admini&s;tration of tho&s;e duties; and though he has in mo&s;t ca&s;es enhanced very much the duty, he has in many entirely neglected the application. If the turnpike tolls of Great Britain &s;hould ever become one of the re&s;ources of govern|ment, we may learn, by the example of many other nations, what would probably be the con&s;equence. Such tolls are no doubt finally paid by the con&s;umer; but the con&s;umer is not taxed in proportion to his expence when he pays, not according to the value, but ac|cording to the bulk or weight of what he con&s;umes. When &s;uch duties are impo&s;ed, not according to the bulk or weight, but ac|cording to the &s;uppo&s;ed value of the goods, they become properly a &s;ort of inland cu&s;toms or exci&s;es, which ob&s;truct very much the mo&s;t important of all branches of commerce, the interior com|merce of the country.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome &s;mall &s;tates duties &s;imilar to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;age duties are im|po&s;ed upon goods carried acro&s;s the territory, either by land or by water, from one foreign country to another. The&s;e are in &s;ome countries called tran&s;it-duties. Some of the little Italian &s;tates, which are &s;ituated upon the Po, and the rivers which run into it, derive &s;ome revenue from duties of this kind, which are paid altoge|ther by foreigners, and which are perhaps the only duties that one &s;tate can impo&s;e upon the &s;ubjects of another without ob&s;tructing in any re&s;pect the indu&s;try or commerce of its own. The mo&s;t important tran&s;it-duty in the world is that levied by the king of Denmark upon all merchant &s;hips which pa&s;s through the Sound.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="518">
SUCH taxes upon luxuries as the greater part of the duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, though they fall indifferently upon every dif|ferent &s;pecies of revenue, and are paid finally, or without any retri|bution, by whoever con&s;umes the commodities upon which they are impo&s;ed, yet they do not always fall equally or proportionably upon the revenue of every individual. As every man's humour regulates the degree of his con&s;umption, every man contributes rather according to his humour than in proportion to his revenue; the profu&s;e contribute more, the par&s;imonious le&s;s, than their proper proportion. During the minority of a man of great for|tune, he contributes commonly very little by his con&s;umption to|wards the &s;upport of that &s;tate from who&s;e protection he derives a great revenue. Tho&s;e who live in another country contribute no|thing by their con&s;umption towards the &s;upport of the government of that country in which is &s;ituated the &s;ource of their revenue. If in this latter country there &s;hould be no land-tax, nor any con|&s;iderable duty upon the transference either of moveable or of im|moveable property, as is the ca&s;e in Ireland, &s;uch ab&s;entees may derive a great revenue from the protection of a government to the &s;upport of which they do not contribute a &s;ingle &s;hilling. This inequality is likely to be greate&s;t in a country of which the go|vernment is in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ubordinate and dependent upon that of &s;ome other. The people who po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive property in the dependent, will in this ca&s;e generally chu&s;e to live in the governing country. Ireland is preci&s;ely in this &s;ituation, and we cannot therefore wonder that the propo&s;al of a tax upon ab&s;entees &s;hould be &s;o very popular in that country. It might per|haps be a little difficult to a&s;certain either what &s;ort, or what degree of ab&s;ence &s;hould &s;ubject a man to be taxed as an ab&s;entee, or at what preci&s;e time the tax &s;hould either begin or end. If you ex|cept, however, this very peculiar &s;ituation, any inequality in the contribution of individuals, which can ari&s;e from &s;uch taxes, is
<PB N="517" REF="519">
much more than compen&s;ated by the very circum&s;tance which occa|&s;ions that inequality; the circum&s;tance that every man's contribution is altogether voluntary; it being altogether in his power either to con&s;ume or not to con&s;ume the commodity taxed. Where &s;uch taxes, therefore, are properly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and upon proper commodi|ties, they are paid with le&s;s grumbling than any other. When they are advanced by the merchant or manufacturer, the con&s;umer, who finally pays them, &s;oon comes to confound them with the price of the commodities, and almo&s;t forgets that he pays any tax.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes are or may be perfectly certain, or may be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o as to leave no doubt concerning either what ought to be paid, or when it ought to be paid; concerning either the quantity or the time of payment. Whatever uncertainty there may &s;ometimes be, either in the duties of cu&s;toms in Great Britain, or in other duties of the &s;ame kind in other countries, it cannot ari&s;e from the na|ture of tho&s;e duties, but from the inaccurate or un&s;kilful manner in which the law that impo&s;es them is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>TAXES upon luxuries generally are, and always may be, paid piece-meal, or in proportion as the contributors have occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e the goods upon which they are impo&s;ed. In the time and mode of payment they are, or may be, of all taxes the mo&s;t con|venient. Upon the whole, &s;uch taxes, therefore, are, perhaps, as agreeable to the three fir&s;t of the four general maxims concerning taxation, as any other. They offend in every re&s;pect again&s;t the fourth.</P>
<P>SUCH taxes, in proportion to what they bring into the public trea|&s;ury of the &s;tate, always take out or keep out of the pockets of the people more than almo&s;t any other taxes. They &s;eem to do this in all the four different ways in which it is po&s;&s;ible to do it.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="520">
FIRST, the levying of &s;uch taxes, even when impo&s;ed in the mo&s;t judicious manner, requires a great number of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and exci&s;e officers, who&s;e &s;alaries and perqui&s;ites are a real tax upon the people, which brings nothing into the trea&s;ury of the &s;tate. This expence, however, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is more mode|rate in Great Britain than in mo&s;t other countries. In the year which ended on the fifth of July, 1775, the gro&s;s produce of the different duties, under the management of the commi&s;&s;ioners of exci&s;e in England, amounted to 5,479,695l. 7s. 10d. which was levied at an expence of little more than five and a half per cent. From this gro&s;s produce, however, there mu&s;t be deducted what was paid away in bounties and drawbacks upon the exportation of exci&s;eable goods, which will reduce the neat produce below five mil|lions. The levying of the &s;alt duty, an exci&s;e duty, but under a different management, is much more expen&s;ive. The neat revenue of the cu&s;toms does not amount to two millions and a half, which is levied at an expence of more than ten per cent. in the &s;alaries of officers, and other incidents. But the perqui&s;ites of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers are every where much greater than their &s;alaries; at &s;ome ports more than double or triple tho&s;e &s;alaries. If the &s;ala|ries of officers, and other incidents, therefore, amount to more than ten per cent. upon the neat revenue of the cu&s;toms; the whole expence of levying that revenue may amount, in &s;alaries and perqui&s;ites together, to more than twenty or thirty per cent. The officers of exci&s;e receive few or no perqui&s;ites; and the admini|&s;tration of that branch of the revenue, being of more recent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, is in general le&s;s corrupted than that of the cu&s;toms, into which length of time has introduced and authori&s;ed many abu&s;es. By charging upon malt the whole revenue which is at pre&s;ent levied by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors, a &s;aving, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of more than fifty thou&s;and pounds might be made in the annual expence of the exci&s;e. By confining the
<PB N="519" REF="521">
duties of cu&s;toms to a few &s;orts of goods, and by levying tho&s;e duties according to the exci&s;e laws, a much greater &s;aving might probably be made in the annual expence of the cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, &s;uch taxes nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion &s;ome ob&s;truction or di&s;couragement to certain branches of indu&s;try. As they always rai&s;e the price of the commodity taxed, they &s;o far di&s;courage its con&s;umption, and con&s;equently its production. If it is a commo|dity of home growth or manufacture, le&s;s labour comes to be employed in rai&s;ing and producing it. If it is a foreign commo|dity of which the tax increa&s;es in this manner the price, the com|modities of the &s;ame kind which are made at home may thereby, indeed, gain &s;ome advantage in the home market, and a greater quantity of dome&s;tic indu&s;try may thereby be turned towards pre|paring them. But though this ri&s;e of price in a foreign commo|dity may encourage dome&s;tic indu&s;try in one particular branch, it nece&s;&s;arily di&s;courages that indu&s;try in almo&s;t every other. The dearer the Birmingham manufacturer buys his foreign wine, the cheaper he nece&s;&s;arily &s;ells that part of his hardware with which, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, with the price of which he buys it. That part of his hardware, therefore, becomes of le&s;s value to him, and he has le&s;s encouragement to work at it. The dearer the con|&s;umers in one country pay for the &s;urplus produce of another, the cheaper they nece&s;&s;arily &s;ell that part of their own &s;urplus produce with which, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, with the price of which they buy it. That part of their own &s;urplus produce becomes of le&s;s value to them, and they have le&s;s encouragement no increa&s;e its quantity. All taxes upon con&s;umable commodities, therefore, tend to reduce the quantity of productive labour below what it otherwi&s;e would be, either in preparing the commodities taxed, if they are home commodities; or in preparing tho&s;e with which they are purcha&s;ed, if they are foreign commodities. Such taxes too
<PB N="520" REF="522">
always alter, more or le&s;s, the natural direction of national indu|&s;try, and turn it into a channel always different from, and gene|rally le&s;s advantageous than that in which it would have run of its own accord.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, the hope of evading &s;uch taxes by &s;muggling gives frequent occa&s;ion to forfeitures and other penalties, which entirely ruin the &s;muggler; a per&s;on who, though no doubt highly blameable for violating the laws of his country, is frequently incapable of violating tho&s;e of natural ju&s;tice, and would have been, in every re&s;pect, an excellent citizen, had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be &s;o. In tho&s;e cor|rupted governments where there is at lea&s;t a general &s;u&s;picion of much unnece&s;&s;ary expence, and great mi&s;application of the pub|lic revenue, the laws which guard it are little re&s;pected. Not many people are &s;crupulous about &s;muggling when, without per|jury, they can find any ea&s;y and &s;afe opportunity of doing &s;o. To pretend to have any &s;cruple about buying &s;muggled goods, though a manife&s;t encouragement to the violation of the revenue laws, and to the perjury which almo&s;t always attends it, would in mo&s;t countries be regarded as one of tho&s;e pedantic pieces of hypo|cri&s;y which, in&s;tead of gaining credit with any body, &s;erve only to expo&s;e the per&s;on who affects to practi&s;e them, to the &s;u&s;picion of being a greater knave than mo&s;t of his neighbours. By this indul|gence of the public, the &s;muggler is often encouraged to continue a trade which he is thus taught to con&s;ider as in &s;ome mea|&s;ure innocent; and when the &s;everity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him, he is frequently di&s;po&s;ed to defend with vio|lence, what he has been accu&s;tomed to regard as his ju&s;t property. From being at fir&s;t, perhaps, rather imprudent than criminal, he at la&s;t too often becomes, one of the hardie&s;t and mo&s;t deter|mined violaters of the laws of &s;ociety. By the ruin of the &s;mug|gler,
<PB N="521" REF="523">
his capital, which had before been employed in maintaining productive labour, is ab&s;orbed either in the revenue of the &s;tate or in that of the revenue-officer, and is employed in maintaining unproductive, to the diminution of the general capital of the &s;ociety, and of the u&s;eful indu&s;try which it might otherwi&s;e have maintained.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, &s;uch taxes, by &s;ubjecting at lea&s;t the dealers in the taxed commodities to the frequent vi&s;its and odious examination of the tax gatherers, expo&s;e them &s;ometimes, no doubt, to &s;ome degree of oppre&s;&s;ion, and always to much trouble and vexation; and though vexation, as has already been &s;aid, is not &s;trictly &s;peaking expence, it is certainly equivalent to the expence at which every man would be willing to redeem him&s;elf from it. The laws of exci&s;e, though more effectual for the purpo&s;e for which they were in&s;tituted, are, in this re&s;pect, more vexatious than tho&s;e of the cu&s;toms. When a merchant has imported goods &s;ubject to certain duties of cu&s;toms, when he has paid tho&s;e duties, and lodged the goods in his ware|hou&s;e, he is not in mo&s;t ca&s;es liable to any further trouble or vexa|tion from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer. It is otherwi&s;e with goods &s;ubject to duties of exci&s;e. The dealers have no re&s;pite from the continual vi&s;its and examination of the exci&s;e officers. The duties of exci&s;e are, upon this account, more unpopular than tho&s;e of the cu&s;toms; and &s;o are the officers who levy them. Tho&s;e officers, it is pretended, though in general, perhaps, they do their duty fully as well as tho&s;e of the cu&s;toms; yet, as that duty obliges them to be frequently very trouble&s;ome to &s;ome of their neigh|bours, commonly contract a certain hardne&s;s of character which the others frequently have not. This ob&s;ervation, however, may very probably be the meer &s;ugge&s;tion of fraudulent dealers, who&s;e &s;mug|gling is either prevented or detected by their diligence.</P>
<P>THE inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in &s;ome degree in&s;eparable from taxes upon con&s;umable commodities, fall as
<PB N="522" REF="524">
light upon the people of Great Britain as upon tho&s;e of any other country of which the government is nearly as expen&s;ive. Our &s;tate is not perfect, and might be mended; but it is as good or better than that of mo&s;t of our neighbours.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the notion that duties upon con&s;umable goods were taxes upon the profits of merchants, tho&s;e duties have, in &s;ome countries, been repeated upon every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ale of the goods. If the profits of the merchant importer or merchant manufacturer were taxed, equality &s;eemed to require that tho&s;e of all the middle buyers, who intervened between either of them and the con&s;umer, &s;hould likewi&s;e be taxed. The famous Alcavala of Spain &s;eems to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed upon this principle. It was at fir&s;t a tax of ten per cent. afterwards of fourteen per cent. and is at pre&s;ent of only &s;ix per cent. upon the &s;ale of every &s;ort of property, whether moveable or immoveable; and it is repeated every time the pro|perty is &s;old. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires concernant les Droits, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 455.</NOTE> The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue officers &s;ufficient to guard the tran&s;portation of goods, not only from one province to another, but from one &s;hop to another. It &s;ubjects not only the dealers in &s;ome &s;orts of goods, but tho&s;e in all &s;orts, every farmer, every manufacturer, every merchant and &s;hop-keeper, to the continual vi&s;its and examination of the tax gatherers. Through the greater part of a country in which a tax of this kind is e&s;tabli&s;hed, nothing can be produced for di&s;tant &s;ale. The produce of every part of the country mu&s;t be propor|tioned to the con&s;umption of the neighbourhood. It is to the Alcavala, accordingly, that U&s;taritz imputes the ruin of the manu|factures of Spain. He might have imputed to it likewi&s;e the declen|&s;ion of agriculture, it being impo&s;ed not only upon manufactures, but upon the rude produce of the land.</P>
<P>IN the kingdom of Naples there is a &s;imilar tax of three per cent. upon the value of all contracts, and con&s;equently upon that
<PB N="523" REF="525">
of all contracts of &s;ale. It is both lighter than the Spani&s;h tax, and the greater part of towns and pari&s;hes are allowed to pay a compo&s;ition in lieu of it. They levy this compo&s;ition in what manner they plea&s;e, generally in a way that gives no interrup|tion to the interior commerce of the place. The Neapolitan tax, therefore, is not near &s;o ruinous as the Spani&s;h one.</P>
<P>THE uniform &s;y&s;tem of taxation, which, with a few excep|tions of no great con&s;equence, takes place in all the different parts of the united kingdom of Great Britain, leaves the in|terior commerce of the country, the inland and coa&s;ting trade, almo&s;t entirely free. The inland trade is almo&s;t per|fectly free, and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end of the kingdom to the other, without requir|ing any permit or let-pa&s;s, without being &s;ubject to que&s;tion, vi&s;it or examination from the revenue officers. There are a few exceptions, but they are &s;uch as can give no interruption to any important branch of the inland commerce of the country. Goods carried coa&s;twi&s;e, indeed, require certificates or coa&s;t|cockets. If you except coals, however, the re&s;t are almo&s;t all duty-free. This freedom of interior commerce, the effect of the uniformity of the &s;y&s;tem of taxation, is perhaps one of the prin|cipal cau&s;es of the pro&s;perity of Great Britain; every great country being nece&s;&s;arily the be&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive market for the greater part of the productions of its own indu&s;try. If the &s;ame free|dom, in con&s;equence of the &s;ame uniformity, could be extended to Ireland and the plantations, both the grandeur of the &s;tate and the pro&s;perity of every part of the empire, would probably be &s;till greater than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN France, the different revenue laws which take place in the different provinces, require a multitude of revenue officers to &s;ur|round, not only the frontiers of the kingdom, but tho&s;e of almo&s;t each particular province, in order either to prevent the
<PB N="524" REF="526">
importation of certain goods, or to &s;ubject it to the payment of certain duties, to the no &s;mall interruption of the interior com|merce of the country. Some provinces are allowed to compound for the gabelle or &s;alt-tax. Others are exempted from it altoge|ther. Some provinces are exempted from the exclu&s;ive &s;ale of tobacco, which the farmers-general enjoy through the greater part of the kingdom. The aides, which corre&s;pond to the exci&s;e in England, are very different in different provinces. Some pro|vinces are exempted from them, and pay a compo&s;ition or equi|valent. In tho&s;e in which they take place and are in farm, there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or di&s;trict. The Traites, which corre&s;pond to our cu&s;|toms, divide the kingdom into three great parts; fir&s;t, the pro|vinces &s;ubject to the tarif of 1664, which are called the pro|vinces of the five great farms, and under which are compre|hended Picardy, Normandy, and the greater part of the interior provinces of the kingdom; &s;econdly, the provinces &s;ubject to the tarif of 1667, which are called the provinces reckoned foreign, and under which are comprehended the greater part of the fron|tier provinces; and, thirdly, tho&s;e provinces which are &s;aid to be treated as foreign, or which, becau&s;e they are allowed a free commerce with foreign countries, are in their commerce with the other provinces of France &s;ubjected to the &s;ame duties as other foreign countries. The&s;e are Al&s;ace, the three bi&s;hopricks of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and the three cities of Dunkirk, Bayonne, and Mar&s;eilles. Both in the provinces of the five great farms, (called &s;o on account of an antient divi&s;ion of the duties of cu&s;toms into five great branches, each of which was originally the &s;ubject of a particular farm, though they are now all united into one) and in tho&s;e which are &s;aid to be reckoned foreign, there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or di&s;trict. There are &s;ome &s;uch even in the
<PB N="525" REF="527">
provinces which are &s;aid to be treated as foreign, particularly in the city of Mar&s;eilles. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve how much both the re&s;traints upon the interior commerce of the country, and the number of the revenue officers mu&s;t be multiplied, in order to guard the frontiers of tho&s;e different provinces and di&s;tricts, which are &s;ubject to &s;uch different &s;y&s;tems of taxation.</P>
<P>OVER and above the general re&s;traints ari&s;ing from this com|plicated &s;y&s;tem of revenue laws, the commerce of wine, after corn perhaps the mo&s;t important production of France, is in the greater part of the provinces &s;ubject to particular re&s;traints ari&s;ing from the favour which has been &s;hewn to the vineyards of particular provinces and di&s;tricts, above tho&s;e of others. The provinces mo&s;t famous for their wines, it will be found, I be|lieve, are tho&s;e in which the trade in that article is &s;ubject to the fewe&s;t re&s;traints of this kind. The exten&s;ive market which &s;uch provinces enjoy, encourages good management both in the cultivation of their vineyards, and in the &s;ub&s;equent preparation of their wines.</P>
<P>SUCH various and complicated revenue laws are not peculiar to France. The little dutchy of Milan is divided into &s;ix pro|vinces, in each of which there is a different &s;y&s;tem of taxation with regard to &s;everal different &s;orts of con&s;umable goods. The &s;till &s;maller territories of the duke of Parma are divided into three or four, each of which has, in the &s;ame manner, a &s;y&s;tem of its own. Under &s;uch ab&s;urd management, nothing but the great fertility of the &s;oil and happine&s;s of the climate could pre|&s;erve &s;uch countries from &s;oon relap&s;ing into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of poverty and barbari&s;m.</P>
<P>TAXES upon con&s;umable commodities may either be levied by an admini&s;tration of which the officers are appointed by govern|ment,
<PB N="526" REF="528">
and are immediately accountable to government, of which the revenue mu&s;t in this ca&s;e vary from year to year, according to the occa&s;ional variations in the produce of the tax; or they may be lett in farm for a rent certain, the farmer being allowed to ap|point his own officers, who, though obliged to levy the tax in the manner directed by the law, are under his immediate in&s;pection, and are immediately accountable to him. The be&s;t and mo&s;t frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for paying the &s;tipulated rent, the &s;ala|ries of the officers, and the whole expence of admini&s;tration, the farmer mu&s;t always draw from the produce of the tax a certain profit proportioned at lea&s;t to the advance which he makes, to the ri&s;k which he runs, to the trouble which he is at, and to the knowledge and &s;kill which it requires to manage &s;o very complicated a concern. Government, by e&s;tabli&s;hing an admini&s;tration under their own immediate in&s;pection of the &s;ame kind with that which the farmer e&s;tabli&s;hes, might at lea&s;t &s;ave this profit which is almo&s;t always exorbitant. To farm any con|&s;iderable branch of the public revenue, requires either a great capi|tal or a great credit; circum&s;tances which would alone re&s;train the competition for &s;uch an undertaking to a very &s;mall number of people. Of the few who have this capital or credit, a &s;till &s;maller number have the nece&s;&s;ary knowledge or experience; an|other circum&s;tance which re&s;trains the competition &s;till further. The very few who are in condition to become competitors find it more for their intere&s;t to combine together; to become co|partners in&s;tead of competitors, and when the farm is &s;et up to auction to offer no rent, but what is much below the real value. In countries where the public revenues are in farm, the farmers are generally the mo&s;t opulent people. Their wealth would alone excite the public indignation, and the vanity which almo&s;t always accompanies &s;uch up&s;tart fortunes, the fooli&s;h o&s;tentation
<PB N="527" REF="529">
with which they commonly di&s;play that wealth, excites that indig|nation &s;till more.</P>
<P>THE farmers of the public revenue never find the laws too &s;evere, which puni&s;h any attempt to evade the payment of a tax. They have no bowels for the contributors, who are not their &s;ub|jects, and who&s;e univer&s;al bankruptcy, if it &s;hould happen the day after their farm is expired, would not much affect their in|tere&s;t. In the greate&s;t exigencies of the &s;tate, when the anxiety of the &s;overeign for the exact payment of his revenue is nece&s;&s;arily the greate&s;t, they &s;eldom fail to complain that without laws more rigorous than tho&s;e which actually take place, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to pay even the u&s;ual rent. In tho&s;e moments of public di&s;tre&s;s their demands cannot be di&s;puted. The revenue laws, therefore, become gradually more and more &s;evere. The mo&s;t &s;anguinary are always to be found in countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm. The milde&s;t, in countries where it is levied under the immediate in&s;pection of the &s;overeign. Even a bad &s;overeign feels more compa&s;&s;ion for his people than can ever be expected from the farmers of his revenue. He knows that the permanent grandeur of his family depends upon the pro&s;perity of his people, and he will never knowingly ruin that pro&s;perity for the &s;ake of any momentary intere&s;t of his own. It is otherwi&s;e with the farmers of his revenue, who&s;e grandeur may frequently be the effect of the ruin, and not of the pro&s;perity of his people.</P>
<P>A TAX is &s;ometimes, not only farmed for a rent certain, but the farmer has, be&s;ides, the monopoly of the commodity taxed. In France, the taxes upon tobacco and &s;alt are levied in this manner. In &s;uch ca&s;es the farmer, in&s;tead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people; the profit of the farmer, and the &s;till more exorbitant one of the monopoli&s;t. Tobacco being
<PB N="528" REF="530">
a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he chu&s;es. But &s;alt being a nece&s;&s;ary, every man is obliged to buy of the farmer a certain quantity of it; becau&s;e if he did not buy this quantity of the farmer, he would, it is pre&s;umed, buy it of &s;ome &s;muggler. The taxes upon both commodities are exorbitant. The temptation to &s;muggle con&s;equently is to many people irre&s;i&s;t|able, while at the &s;ame time the rigour of the law, and the vigi|lance of the farmer's officers, render the yielding to that tempta|tion almo&s;t certainly ruinous. The &s;muggling of &s;alt and tobacco fends every year &s;everal hundred people to the gallies, be&s;ides a very con&s;iderable number whom it &s;ends to the gibbet. Tho&s;e taxes levied in this manner yield a very con&s;iderable revenue to government. In 1767, the farm of tobacco was lett for twenty-two millions five hundred and forty-one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;eventy-eight livres a year. That of &s;alt, for thirty-&s;ix mil|lions four hundred and ninety-two thou&s;and four hundred and four livres. The farm in both ca&s;es was to commence in 1768, and to la&s;t for &s;ix years. Tho&s;e who con&s;ider the blood of the people as nothing in compari&s;on with the revenue of the prince, may perhaps approve of this method of levying taxes. Similar taxes and monopolies of &s;alt and tobacco, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in many other countries; particularly in the Au&s;trian and Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and in the greater part of the &s;tates of Italy.</P>
<P>IN France, the greater part of the actual revenue of the crown is derived from eight different &s;ources; the taille, the capitation, the two vingtiemes, the gabelles, the aides, the traites, the domaine, and the farm of tobacco. The five la&s;t are, in the greater part of the provinces, under farm. The three fir&s;t are every where levied by an admini&s;tration under the immediate in|&s;pection and direction of government, and it is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged that in proportion to what they take out of the pockets of the people, they bring more into the trea&s;ury of the prince than
<PB N="529" REF="531">
the other five, of which the admini&s;tration is much more wa&s;teful and expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE finances of France &s;eem, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, to admit of three very obvious reformations. Fir&s;t, by aboli&s;hing the taille and the capitation, and by increa&s;ing the number of vingtiemes, &s;o as to produce an additional revenue equal to the amount of tho&s;e other taxes, the revenue of the crown might be pre&s;erved; the expence of collection might be much dimini&s;hed; the vexation of the inferior ranks of people, which the taille and capitation occa|&s;ion, might be entirely prevented; and the &s;uperior ranks might not be more burdened than the greater part of them are at pre&s;ent. The vingtieme, I have already ob&s;erved, is a tax very nearly of the &s;ame kind with what is called the land-tax of England. The bur|den of the taille, it is acknowledged, falls finally upon the proprie|tors of land; and as the greater part of the capitation is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to the taille at &s;o much a pound of that other tax, the final payment of the greater part of it mu&s;t likewi&s;e fall upon the &s;ame order of people. Though the number of the vingtiemes, therefore, was increa&s;ed &s;o as to pro|duce an additional revenue equal to the amount of both tho&s;e taxes, the &s;uperior ranks of people might not be more burdened than they are at pre&s;ent. Many individuals no doubt would; on account of the great inequalities with which the taille is commonly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the e&s;tates and tenants of different individuals. The intere&s;t and oppo&s;ition of &s;uch favoured &s;ubjects are the ob&s;ta|cles mo&s;t likely to prevent this or any other reformation of the &s;ame kind. Secondly, by rendering the gabelle, the aides, the taxes upon tobacco, all their different cu&s;toms and exci&s;es uniform in all the different parts of the kingdom, tho&s;e taxes might be levied at much le&s;s expence, and the interior commerce of the kingdom might be rendered as free as that of England. Thirdly, and la&s;tly,
<PB N="530" REF="532">
by &s;ubjecting all tho&s;e taxes to an admini&s;tration under the imme|diate in&s;pection and direction of government, the exorbitant profits of the farmers general might be added to the revenue of the &s;tate. The oppo&s;ition ari&s;ing from the private intere&s;t of individuals, is likely to be as effectual for preventing the two la&s;t as the fir&s;t men|tioned &s;cheme of reformation.</P>
<P>THE French &s;y&s;tem of taxation &s;eems, in every re&s;pect, inferior to the Briti&s;h. In Great Britain ten millions &s;terling are annually levied upon le&s;s than eight millions of people, without its being po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay that any particular order is oppre&s;&s;ed. From the collections of the abbe Expilly, and the ob&s;ervations of the author of the E&s;&s;ay upon the legi&s;lation and commerce of corn, it appears probable that France, including the provinces of Lorraine and Bar, contains about twenty-three or twenty-four millions of people; three times the number perhaps contained in great Britain. The &s;oil and climate of France are better than tho&s;e of Great Britain. The country has been much longer in a &s;tate of improvement and cultivation, and is, upon that account, better &s;tocked with all tho&s;e things which it requires a long time to rai&s;e up and accumulate, &s;uch as great towns, and convenient and well-built hou&s;es, both in town and country. With the&s;e advantages it might be expected that in France a revenue of thirty millions might be levied for the &s;upport of the &s;tate, with as little inconveniency as a revenue of ten millions is in Great Britain. In 1765 and 1766, the whole reve|nue paid into the trea&s;ury of France, according to the be&s;t, though, I acknowledge, very imperfect accounts which I could get of it, u&s;ually run between 308 and 325 millions of livres; that is, it did not amount to fifteen millions &s;terling; not the half of what might have been expected, had the people contributed in the &s;ame propor|tion to their numbers as the people of Great Britain. The people of France, however, it is generally acknowledged, are much more
<PB N="531" REF="533">
oppre&s;&s;ed by taxes than the people of Great Britain. France, how|ever, is certainly the great empire in Europe which, after that of Great Britain, enjoys the milde&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent government.</P>
<P>IN Holland the heavy taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life have ruined, it is &s;aid, their principal manufactures, and are likely to di&s;courage gradually even their fi&s;heries and their trade in &s;hip building. The taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life are incon&s;iderable in Great Britain, and no manufacture has hitherto been ruined by them. The Briti&s;h taxes which bear harde&s;t on manufactures are &s;ome duties upon the importation of raw materials, particularly upon that of raw &s;ilk. The revenue of the &s;tates general and of the different cities, however, is &s;aid to amount to more than five millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; and as the inhabitants of the United Provinces cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to more than a third part of tho&s;e of Great Britain, they mu&s;t, in proportion to their number, be much more heavily taxed,</P>
<P>AFTER all the proper &s;ubjects of taxation have been exhau&s;ted, if the exigencies of the &s;tate &s;till continue to require new taxes, they mu&s;t be impo&s;ed upon improper ones. The taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, therefore, may be no impeachment of the wi&s;dom of that republic, which, in order to acquire and to maintain its independency, has, in &s;pite of its great frugality, been involved in &s;uch expen&s;ive wars as have obliged it to contract great debts. The &s;ingular countries of Holland and Zealand, be&s;ides, require a con&s;iderable expence even to pre&s;erve their exi&s;tence, or to prevent their being &s;wallowed up by the &s;ea, which mu&s;t have contributed to increa&s;e con&s;iderably the load of taxes in tho&s;e two provinces. The republican form of government &s;eems to be the principal &s;up|port of the pre&s;ent grandeur of Holland. The owners of great capitals, the great mercantile families, have generally either &s;ome
<PB N="532" REF="534">
direct &s;hare, or &s;ome indirect influence in the admini&s;tration of that government. For the &s;ake of the re&s;pect and authority which they derive from this &s;ituation, they are willing to live in a country where their capital, if they employ it them&s;elves, will bring them le&s;s profit, and if they lend it to another, le&s;s intere&s;t; and where the very moderate revenue which they can draw from it will pur|cha&s;e le&s;s of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life than in any other part of Europe. The re&s;idence of &s;uch wealthy people ne|ce&s;&s;arily keeps alive, in &s;pite of all di&s;advantages, a certain degree of indu&s;try in the country. Any public calamity which &s;hould de&s;troy the republican form of government, which &s;hould throw the whole admini&s;tration into the hands of nobles and of &s;oldiers, which &s;hould annihilate altogether the importance of tho&s;e wealthy merchants, would &s;oon render it di&s;agreeable to them to live in a country where they were no longer likely to be much re&s;pected. They would remove both their re&s;idence and their capital to &s;ome other country, and the indu&s;try and commerce of Holland would &s;oon follow the capitals which &s;upported them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of publick Debts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN that rude &s;tate of &s;ociety which precedes the exten&s;ion of commerce and the improvement of manufactures, when tho&s;e expen&s;ive luxuries which commerce and manufactures can alone in|troduce, are altogether unknown, the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large revenue, I have endeavoured to &s;how in the third book of this inquiry, can &s;pend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large revenue may at all times be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the command of a large quantity of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. In that rude &s;tate of things it is commonly paid in a large quantity of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, in the ma|terials of plain food and coar&s;e cloathing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw hides. When neither commerce, nor manufactures furni&s;h any thing for which the owner can exchange the greater part of tho&s;e materials which are over and above his own con&s;ump|tion, he can do nothing with the &s;urplus but feed and cloathe nearly as many people as it will feed and cloathe. A ho&s;pitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there is no o&s;tentation, occa&s;ion, in this &s;ituation of things, the principal expences of the rich and the great. But the&s;e, I have likewi&s;e endeavoured to &s;how in the &s;ame book, are expences by which people are not very apt to ruin them&s;elves. There is not perhaps any &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ure &s;o frivolous, of which the pur&s;uit has not &s;ometimes ruined even &s;en&s;ible men. A pa&s;&s;ion for cock-fighting has ruined many. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the in&s;tances, I believe, are not very numerous of people who have been ruined by a ho&s;pitality or liberality of this kind; though the ho&s;pitality of luxury and the liberality of o&s;tentation have ruined many. Among our feudal ance&s;tors, the long time during which
<PB N="534" REF="536">
e&s;tates u&s;ed to continue in the &s;ame family &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates the general di&s;po&s;ition of people to live within their income. Though the ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed by the great land|holders may not to us in the pre&s;ent times &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with that order which we are apt to con&s;ider as in&s;eparably connected with good oeconomy, yet we mu&s;t certainly allow them to have been at lea&s;t &s;o far frugal as not commonly to have &s;pent their whole income. A part of their wool and raw hides they had ge|nerally an opportunity of &s;elling for money. Some part of this money perhaps they &s;pent in purcha&s;ing the few objects of vanity and luxury with which the circum&s;tances of the times could furni&s;h them; but &s;ome part of it they &s;eem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well indeed do any thing el&s;e but hoard whatever money they &s;aved. To trade was di&s;graceful to a gentleman, and to lend money at intere&s;t, which at that time was con&s;idered as u&s;ury and prohibited by law, would have been &s;till more &s;o. In tho&s;e times of violence and di&s;order, be&s;ides, it was convenient to have a hoard of money at hand, that in ca&s;e they &s;hould be driven from their own home they might have &s;omething of known value to carry with them to &s;ome place of &s;afety. The &s;ame violence which made it convenient to hoard, made it equally convenient to conceal the hoard. The frequency of trea&s;ure trove, or of trea&s;ure found of which no owner was known, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates the frequency in tho&s;e times both of hoarding and of concealing the hoard. Trea&s;ure-trove was then con&s;idered as an important branch of the revenue of the &s;overeign. All the trea&s;ure-trove of the kingdom would &s;carce perhaps in the pre&s;ent times make an important branch of the revenue of a private gentleman of a good e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave and to hoard prevailed in the &s;ove|reign, as well as in the &s;ubjects. Among nations to whom com|merce and manufactures are little known, the &s;overeign, it has
<PB N="535" REF="537">
already been ob&s;erved in the fourth book, is in a &s;ituation which naturally di&s;po&s;es him to the par&s;imony requi&s;ite for accumulation. In that &s;ituation the expence even of a &s;overeign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the trinkets in which that finery con&s;i&s;ts. Standing armies are not then nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o that the expence even of a &s;overeign, like that of any other great lord, can be employed in &s;carce any thing but bounty to his tenants, and ho&s;pitality to his retainers. But bounty and ho&s;pitality very &s;eldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almo&s;t always does. All the antient &s;overeigns of Europe accordingly, it has already been ob&s;erved, had trea&s;ures. Every Tartar chief in the pre&s;ent times is &s;aid to have one.</P>
<P>IN a commercial country abounding with every &s;ort of expen&s;ive luxury, the &s;overeign, in the &s;ame manner as almo&s;t all the great proprietors in his dominions, naturally &s;pends a great part of his revenue in purcha&s;ing tho&s;e luxuries. His own and the neighbour|ing countries &s;upply him abundantly with all the co&s;tly trinkets which compo&s;e the &s;plendid, but in&s;ignificant pageantry of a court. For the &s;ake of an inferior pageantry of the &s;ame kind, his nobles di&s;mi&s;s their retainers, make their tenants independent, and be|come gradually them&s;elves as in&s;ignificant as the greater part of the wealthy burghers in his dominions. The &s;ame frivolous pa&s;&s;ions which influence their conduct influence his. How can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he &s;hould be the only rich man in his dominions who is in&s;en&s;ible to plea&s;ures of this kind? If he does not, what he is very likely to do, &s;pend upon tho&s;e plea&s;ures &s;o great a part of his revenue as to debilitate very much the defen&s;ive power of the &s;tate, it cannot well be expected that he &s;hould not &s;pend upon them all that part of it which is over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting that defen&s;ive power. His ordinary expence be|comes
<PB N="536" REF="538">
equal to his ordinary revenue, and it is well if it does not frequently exceed it. The ama&s;&s;ing of trea&s;ure can no longer be expected, and when extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expences, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily call upon his &s;ubjects for an extraor|dinary aid. The pre&s;ent and the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia are the only great princes of Europe who, &s;ince the death of Henry IV. of France in 1610, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have ama&s;&s;ed any con&s;iderable trea&s;ure. The par&s;imony which leads to accumulation has become almo&s;t as rare in republican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the United Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of Berne is the &s;ingle republic in Europe which has ama&s;&s;ed any con&s;iderable trea&s;ure. The other Swi&s;s republics have not. The ta&s;te for &s;ome &s;ort of pageantry, for &s;plendid buildings, at lea&s;t, and other publick ornaments, fre|quently prevails as much in the apparently &s;ober &s;enate-hou&s;e of a little republic as in the di&s;&s;ipated court of the greate&s;t king.</P>
<P>THE want of par&s;imony in time of peace, impo&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of contracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the trea&s;ury but what is nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the ordinary expence of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. In war an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of three or four times that expence becomes nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the &s;tate, and con&s;equently a revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue. Suppo&s;ing that the &s;overeign &s;hould have, what he &s;carce ever has, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of his expence, yet &s;till the produce of the taxes from which this increa&s;e of revenue mu&s;t be drawn will not begin to come into the trea&s;ury till per|haps ten or twelve months after they are impo&s;ed. But the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in which it appears likely to begin, the army mu&s;t be augmented, the fleet mu&s;t be fitted out, the garri&s;oned towns mu&s;t be put into a po&s;ture of defence;
<PB N="537" REF="539">
that army, that fleet, tho&s;e garri&s;oned towns mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with arms, ammunition and provi&s;ions. An immediate and great expence mu&s;t be incurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait for the gradual and &s;low returns of the new taxes. In this exigency government can have no other re&s;ource but in borrowing.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame commercial &s;tate of &s;ociety which, by the operation of moral cau&s;es, brings government in this manner into the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of borrowing, produces in the &s;ubjects both an ability and an inclination to lend. If it commonly brings along with it the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing, it likewi&s;e brings along with it the facility of doing &s;o.</P>
<P>A COUNTRY abounding with merchants and manufacturers, nece&s;&s;arily abounds with a &s;et of people through who&s;e hands, not only their own capitals, but the capitals of all tho&s;e who either lend them money, or tru&s;t them with goods, pa&s;s as fre|quently, or more frequently, than the revenue of a private man, who, without trade or bu&s;ine&s;s, lives upon his income, pa&s;&s;es through his hands. The revenue of &s;uch a man can regularly pa&s;s through his hands only once in the year. But the whole amount of the capital and credit of a merchant who deals in a trade of which the returns are very quick, may &s;ometimes pa&s;s through his hands two, three, or four times in a year. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, therefore, nece&s;|&s;arily abounds with a &s;et of people who have it at all times in their power to advance, if they chu&s;e to do &s;o, a very large &s;um of mo|ney to government. Hence the ability in the &s;ubjects of a com|mercial &s;tate to lend.</P>
<P>COMMERCE and manufactures can &s;eldom flouri&s;h long in any &s;tate which does not enjoy a regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in which the people do not feel them&s;elves &s;ecure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="538" REF="540">
their property, in which the faith of contracts is not &s;upported by law, and in which the authority of the &s;tate is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from all tho&s;e who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in &s;hort, can &s;eldom flouri&s;h in any &s;tate in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the ju&s;tice of government. The &s;ame confidence which di&s;po&s;es great merchants and manufac|turers, upon ordinary occa&s;ions, to tru&s;t their property to the pro|tection of a particular government; di&s;po&s;es them, upon extraor|dinary occa&s;ions, to tru&s;t that government with the u&s;e of their property. By lending money to government, they do not even for a moment dimini&s;h their ability to carry on their trade and manufactures. On the contrary, they commonly augment it. The nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate render government upon mo&s;t oc|ca&s;ions willing to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender. The &s;ecurity which it grants to the original creditor, is made transferable to any other creditor, and, from the univer&s;al confidence in the ju&s;tice of the &s;tate, generally &s;ells in the market for more than was originally paid for it. The merchant or monied man makes money by lending money to go|vernment, and in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;es his trading capi|tal. He generally con&s;iders it as a favour, therefore, when the admini&s;tration admits him to a &s;hare in the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription for a new loan. Hence the inclination or willingne&s;s in the &s;ubjects of a commercial &s;tate to lend.</P>
<P>THE government of &s;uch a &s;tate is very apt to repo&s;e it&s;elf upon this ability and willingne&s;s of its &s;ubjects to lend it their money on extraordinary occa&s;ions. It fore&s;ees the facility of bor|rowing, and therefore di&s;pen&s;es it&s;elf from the duty of &s;aving.</P>
<P>IN a rude &s;tate of &s;ociety there are no great mercantile or manufacturing capitals. The individuals who hoard whatever
<PB N="539" REF="541">
money they can &s;ave, and who conceal their hoard, do &s;o from a di&s;tru&s;t of the ju&s;tice of government, from a fear that if it was known that they had a hoard, and where that hoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things few people would be able, and nobody would be willing to lend their money to government on extraordinary exigencies. The &s;overeign feels that he mu&s;t provide for &s;uch exigencies by &s;aving, becau&s;e he fore&s;ees the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of borrowing. This fore&s;ight increa&s;es &s;till further his natural di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ave.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of the enormous debts which at pre&s;ent oppre&s;s, and will in the long-run probably ruin all the great nations of Europe, has been pretty uniform. Nations, like private men, have generally begun to borrow upon what may be called per&s;onal credit, without a&s;&s;igning or mortgaging any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this re&s;ource has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon a&s;&s;ignments or mortgages of particular funds.</P>
<P>WHAT is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain, is con|tracted in the former of tho&s;e two ways. It con&s;i&s;ts partly in a debt which bears or is &s;uppo&s;ed to bear no intere&s;t, and which re&s;embles the debts that a private man contracts upon account; and partly in a debt which bears intere&s;t, and which re&s;embles what a private man contracts upon his bill or promi&s;&s;ory note. The debts which are due either for extraordinary &s;ervices, or for &s;ervices either not provided for, or not paid at the time when they are performed; part of the extraordinaries of the army, navy, and ordnance, the arrears of &s;ub&s;idies to foreign princes, tho&s;e of &s;eamens wages, &amp;c. u&s;ually con&s;titute a debt of the fir&s;t kind. Navy and exchequer bills, which are i&s;&s;ued &s;ometimes in pay|ment of a part of &s;uch debts, and &s;ometimes for other purpo&s;es;
<PB N="540" REF="542">
con&s;titute a debt of the &s;econd kind; exchequer bills bearing in|tere&s;t from the day on which they are i&s;&s;ued, and navy bills &s;ix months after they are i&s;&s;ued. The bank of England, either by volun|tarily di&s;counting tho&s;e bills at their current value; or by agreeing with government for certain con&s;iderations to circulate Exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the intere&s;t which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value and facili|tates their circulation, and thereby frequently enables government to contract a very large debt of this kind. In France, where there is no bank, the &s;tate bills (billets d'etat) <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Examen des Reflexions politiques &s;ur les finances.</NOTE> have &s;ometimes &s;old at &s;ixty and &s;eventy per cent. di&s;count. During the great re-coinage in king William's time, when the bank of England thought proper to put a &s;top to its u&s;ual tran&s;actions, exchequer bills and tallies are &s;aid to have &s;old from twenty-five to &s;ixty per cent. di&s;count; owing partly, no doubt, to the &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;tability of the new government e&s;tabli&s;hed by the revolution, but partly too to the want of the &s;upport of the bank of England.</P>
<P>WHEN this re&s;ource is exhau&s;ted, and it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, in order to rai&s;e money, to a&s;&s;ign or mortgage &s;ome particular branch of the public revenue for the payment of the debt, government has upon different occa&s;ions done this in two different ways. Some|times it has made this a&s;&s;ignment or mortgage for a &s;hort period of time only, a year or a few years, for example; and &s;ometimes for perpetuity. In the one ca&s;e the fund was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient to pay, within the limited time, both principal and intere&s;t of the money borrowed. In the other it was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient to pay the intere&s;t only, or a perpetual annuity equivalent to the intere&s;t, government being at liberty to redeem at any time this annuity upon paying back the principal &s;um borrowed. When money was rai&s;ed in the one way, it was &s;aid to be rai&s;ed by anticipation; when in the other, by perpetual funding, or, more &s;hortly, by funding.</P>
<P><PB N="541" REF="543">
IN Great Britain the annual land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated every year, by virtue of a borrowing clau&s;e con&s;tantly in&s;erted into the acts which impo&s;e them. The bank of Eng|land generally advances at an intere&s;t, which &s;ince the revolution has varied from eight to three per cent. the &s;ums for which tho&s;e taxes are granted, and receives payment as their produce gra|dually comes in. If there is a deficiency, which there always is, it is provided for in the &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year. The only con&s;iderable branch of the public revenue which yet remains unmortgaged is thus regularly &s;pent before it comes in. Like an unprovident &s;pendthrift, who&s;e pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions will not allow him to wait for the regular payment of his revenue, the &s;tate is in the con&s;tant practice of borrowing of its own factors and agents, and of paying intere&s;t for the u&s;e of its own money.</P>
<P>IN the reign of king William, and during a great part of that of queen Anne, before we had become &s;o familiar as we are now with the practice of perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were impo&s;ed but for a &s;hort period of time, (for four, five, &s;ix, or &s;even years only) and a great part of the grants of every year con&s;i&s;ted in loans upon anticipations of the produce of tho&s;e taxes. The produce being frequently in&s;uffi|cient for paying within the limited term the principal and intere&s;t of the money borrowed, deficiencies aro&s;e, to make good which it became nece&s;&s;ary to prolong the term.</P>
<P>IN 1697, by the 8th of William III. c. 20. the deficiencies of &s;everal taxes were charged upon what was then called the fir&s;t general mortgage or fund, con&s;i&s;ting of a prolongation to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1706, of &s;everal different taxes, which would have expired within a &s;horter term, and of which the produce was accumulated into one general fund. The deficiencies charged upon this prolonged term amounted to 5,160,459 l. 14s. 9&frac14;d.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="544">
IN 1701 tho&s;e duties with &s;ome others were &s;till further pro|longed for the like purpo&s;es till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1710, and were called the &s;econd general mortgage or fund. The deficien|cies charged upon it amounted to 2,055,999 l. 7s. 11&frac12;d.</P>
<P>IN 1707, tho&s;e duties were &s;till further prolonged, as a fund for new loans, to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1712, and were called the third general mortgage or fund. The &s;um borrowed upon it was 983,254 l. 11s. 9&frac14;d.</P>
<P>IN 1708, tho&s;e duties were all (except the old &s;ub&s;idy of ton|nage and poundage, of which one moiety only was made a part of this fund, and a duty upon the importation of Scotch linen, which had been taken off by the articles of union) &s;till further continued, as a fund for new loans, to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1714, and were called the fourth general mortgage or fund. The &s;um borrowed upon it was 925,1761. 9s. 2&frac14;d.</P>
<P>IN 1709, tho&s;e duties were all (except the old &s;ub&s;idy of ton|nage and poundage, which was now left out of this fund alto|gether) &s;till further continued for the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1716, and were called the fifth general mortgage or fund. The &s;um borrowed upon it was 922,029 l. 6s. od.</P>
<P>IN 1710, tho&s;e duties were again prolonged to the fir&s;t of Au|gu&s;t, 1720, and were called the &s;ixth general mortgage or fund. The &s;um borrowed upon it was 1,296,552 l. 9s. 11&frac34;d.</P>
<P>IN 1711, the &s;ame duties (which at this time were thus &s;ubject to four different anticipations) together with &s;everal others were continued for ever, and made a fund for paying the intere&s;t of the capital of the South Sea company, which had that year ad|vanced to government, for paying debts and making good defi|ciencies, the &s;um of 9,177,967 l. 15s. 4d. the greate&s;t loan which at that time had ever been made.</P>
<P><PB N="543" REF="545">
BEFORE this period, the principal, &s;o far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, the only taxes which in order to pay the intere&s;t of a debt had been impo&s;ed for perpetuity, were tho&s;e for paying the intere&s;t of the money which had been advanced to government by the Bank and Ea&s;t India company, and of what it was expected would be advanced, but which was never advanced, by a pro|jected land-bank. The bank fund at this time amounted to 3,375,027l. 17s. 10&frac12;d. for which was paid an annuity or intere&s;t of 206,501l. 13s. 5d. The Ea&s;t India fund amounted to 3,200,000l. for which was paid an annuity or intere&s;t of 160,000l.; the bank fund being at &s;ix per cent. the Ea&s;t India fund at five per cent. intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IN 1715, by the fir&s;t of George I. c. 12. the different taxes which had been mortgaged for paying the bank annuity, together with &s;everal others which by this act were likewi&s;e rendered per|petual, were accumulated into one common fund called The Aggregate Fund, which was charged, not only with the payment of the bank annuity, but with &s;everal other annuities and bur|dens of different kinds. This fund was afterwards augmented by the third of George I. c. 8. and by the fifth of George I. c. 3. and the different duties which were then added to it were likewi&s;e rendered perpetual.</P>
<P>IN 1717, by the third of George I. c. 7. &s;everal other taxes were rendered perpetual, and accumulated into another common fund, called The General Fund, for the payment of certain an|nuities, amounting in the whole to 724,849l. 6s. 10&frac12;d.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of tho&s;e different acts, the greater part of the taxes which before had been anticipated only for a &s;hort term of years, were rendered perpetual as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the intere&s;t only, of the money which had been bor|rowed upon them by different &s;ucce&s;&s;ive anticipations.</P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="546">
HAD money never been rai&s;ed but by anticipation, the cour&s;e of a few years would have liberated the public revenue, without any other attention of government be&s;ides that of not overloading the fund by charging it with more debt than it could pay within the limited term, and of not anticipating a &s;econd time before the ex|piration of the fir&s;t anticipation. But the greater part of European governments have been incapable of tho&s;e attentions. They have frequently overloaded the fund even upon the fir&s;t anticipation; and when this happened not to be the ca&s;e, they have generally taken care to overload it by anticipating a &s;econd and a third time before the expiration of the fir&s;t anticipation. The fund becoming in this manner altogether in&s;ufficient for paying both principal and intere&s;t of the money borrowed upon it, it became nece&s;&s;ary to charge it with the intere&s;t only, or a perpetual annuity equal to the intere&s;t, and &s;uch unprovident anticipations nece&s;&s;arily gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding. But though this practice nece&s;&s;arily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period to one &s;o indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive; yet as a greater &s;um can in all ca&s;es be rai&s;ed by this new practice than by the old one of anticipations, the former, when men have once become familiar with it, has in the great exigencies of the &s;tate been univer&s;ally preferred to the latter. To relieve the pre&s;ent exigency is always the object which principally intere&s;ts tho&s;e immediately concerned in the admini|&s;tration of public affairs. The future liberation of the public revenue, they leave to the care of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>DURING the reign of queen Anne, the market rate of intere&s;t had fallen from &s;ix to five per cent. and in the twelfth year of her reign five per cent. was declared to be the highe&s;t rate which could lawfully be taken for money borrowed upon private &s;ecurity. Soon after the greater part of the temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual, and di&s;tributed into the Aggregate, South Sea, and General Funds, the creditors of the
<PB N="545" REF="547">
publick, like tho&s;e of private per&s;ons, were induced to accept of five per cent. for the intere&s;t of their money, which occa&s;ioned a &s;aving of one per cent. upon the capital of the greater part of the debts which had been thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-&s;ixth of the greater part of the annuities which were paid out of the three great funds above mentioned. This &s;aving left a con&s;iderable &s;urplus in the produce of the different taxes which had been accu|mulated into tho&s;e funds, over and above what was nece&s;&s;ary for paying the annuities which were now charged upon them, and laid the foundation of what has &s;ince been called the Sinking Fund. In 1717, it amounted to 323,434l. 7s. 7&frac12;d. In 1727, the in|tere&s;t of the greater part of the public debts was &s;till further re|duced to four per cent.; and in 1753 and 1757, to three and a half and three per cent.; which reductions &s;till further augmented the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>A SINKING fund, though in&s;tituted for the payment of old, facilitates very much the contracting of new debts. It is a &s;ub|&s;idiary fund always at hand to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund, upon which money is propo&s;ed to be rai&s;ed in any exigency of the &s;tate. Whether the &s;inking fund of Great Britain has been more frequently applied to the one or to the other of tho&s;e two purpo&s;es, will &s;ufficiently appear by and by.</P>
<P>BESIDES tho&s;e two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by perpetual funding, there are two other methods, which hold a &s;ort of middle place between them. The&s;e are, that of borrowing upon annuities for terms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.</P>
<P>DURING the reigns of king William and queen Anne, large &s;ums were frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which
<PB N="546" REF="548">
were &s;ometimes longer and &s;ometimes &s;horter. In 1693, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for borrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent. or of 140,000l. a year for &s;ixteen years. In 1691, an act was pa&s;&s;ed for borrowing a million upon annuities for lives, upon terms which in the pre&s;ent times would appear very advan|tageous. But the &s;ub&s;cription was not filled up. In the following year the deficiency was made good by borrowing upon annuities for lives at fourteen per cent. or at little more than &s;even years pur|cha&s;e. In 1695, the per&s;ons who had purcha&s;ed tho&s;e annuities were allowed to exchange them for others of ninety-&s;ix years, upon paying into the Exchequer &s;ixty-three pounds in the hun|dred; that is, the difference between fourteen per cent. for life, and fourteen per cent. for ninety-&s;ix years, was &s;old for &s;ixty-three pounds, or for four and a half years purcha&s;e. Such was the &s;up|po&s;ed in&s;tability of government, that even the&s;e terms procured few purcha&s;ers. In the reign of queen Anne, money was upon different occa&s;ions borrowed both upon annuities for lives, and upon annuities for terms of thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety|eight, and of ninety-nine years. In 1719, the proprietors of the annuities for thirty-two years were induced to accept in lieu of them South-&s;ea &s;tock to the amount of eleven and a half years pur|cha&s;e of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of &s;tock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them. In 1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long and &s;hort were &s;ub&s;cribed into the &s;ame fund. The long annuities at that time amounted to 666,821l. 8s. 3&frac12;d. a year. On the 5th of January, 1775, the remainder of them, or what was not &s;ub&s;cribed at that time, amounted only to 136,453l. 12s. 8d.</P>
<P>DURING the two wars which begun in 1739, and in 1755, little money was borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years, or
<PB N="547" REF="549">
upon tho&s;e for lives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth nearly as much money as a perpetuity, and &s;hould therefore, one might think, be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But tho&s;e who, in order to make family &s;ettle|ments, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the public &s;tocks, would not care to purcha&s;e into one of which the value was continually dimini&s;hing; and &s;uch people make a very con&s;iderable proportion both of the proprietors and purcha&s;ers of &s;tock. An annuity for a long term of years therefore, though its intrin&s;ic value may be very nearly the &s;ame with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the &s;ame number of purcha&s;ers. The &s;ub|&s;cribers to a new loan, who mean generally to &s;ell their &s;ub&s;cription as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, prefer greatly a perpetual annuity redeemable by parliament, to an irredeemable annuity for a long term of years of only equal amount. The value of the former may be &s;uppo&s;ed always the &s;ame or very nearly the &s;ame, and it makes therefore a more convenient transferable &s;tock than the latter.</P>
<P>DURING the two la&s;t mentioned wars, annuities either for terms of years or for lives were &s;eldom granted but as premiums to the &s;ub&s;cribers to a new loan, over and above the redeemable annuity or intere&s;t upon the credit of which the loan was &s;uppo&s;ed to be made. They were granted, not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed; but as an additional encouragement to the lender.</P>
<P>ANNUITIES for lives have occa&s;ionally been granted in two different ways; either upon &s;eparate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French are called Tontines, from the name of their in|ventor. When annuities are granted upon &s;eparate lives, the death of every individual annuitant di&s;burthens the public revenue &s;o far as it was affected by his annuity. When annuities are
<PB N="548" REF="550">
granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public revenue does not commence till the death of all the annuitants comprehended in one lot, which may &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of twenty or thirty per|&s;ons, of whom the &s;urvivors &s;ucceed to the annuities of all tho&s;e who die before them; the la&s;t &s;urvivor &s;ucceeding to the annui|ties of the whole lot. Upon the &s;ame revenue more money can always be rai&s;ed by tontines than by annuities for &s;eparate lives. An annuity, with a right of &s;urvivor&s;hip, is really worth more than an equal annuity for a &s;eparate life, and from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the &s;ucce&s;s of all lotteries, &s;uch an annuity generally &s;ells for &s;omething more than it is worth. In countries where it is u&s;ual for government to rai&s;e money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this account generally pre|ferred to annuities for &s;eparate lives. The expedient which will rai&s;e mo&s;t money, is almo&s;t always preferred to that which is likely to bring about in the &s;peedie&s;t manner the liberation of the public revenue.</P>
<P>IN France a much greater proportion of the public debts con|&s;i&s;ts in annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir pre&s;ented by the parliament of Bourdeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt of France is e&s;timated at twenty|four hundred millions of livres; of which the capital for which annuities for lives had been granted, is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to three hundred millions, the eighth-part of the whole public debt. The annuities them&s;elves are computed to amount to thirty millions a year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t of that whole debt. The&s;e e&s;ti|mations, I know very well, are not exact, but having been pre|&s;ented by &s;o very re&s;pectable a body as approximations to the truth, they may, I apprehend, be con&s;idered as &s;uch. It is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of France
<PB N="549" REF="551">
and England for the liberation of the public revenue, which occa|&s;ions this difference in their re&s;pective modes of borrowing. It ari&s;es altogether from the different views and intere&s;ts of the lenders.</P>
<P>IN England, the &s;eat of government being in the greate&s;t mer|cantile city in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money to government. By advancing it they do not mean to dimini&s;h, but, on the contrary, to increa&s;e their mercantile capitals; and unle&s;s they expected to &s;ell with &s;ome profit their &s;hare in the &s;ub&s;cription for a new loan, they never would &s;ub&s;cribe. But if by advancing their money they were to purcha&s;e, in&s;tead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only, whether their own or tho&s;e of other people, they would not always be &s;o likely to &s;ell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own lives they would always &s;ell with lo&s;s; becau&s;e no man will give for an annuity upon the life of another, who&s;e age and &s;tate of health are nearly the &s;ame with his own, the &s;ame price which he would give for one upon his own. An annuity upon the life of a third per&s;on, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal value to the buyer and the &s;eller; but its real value begins to dimini&s;h from the moment it is granted, and continues to do &s;o more and more as long as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. It can never, therefore, make &s;o convenient a transferable &s;tock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be &s;uppo&s;ed always the &s;ame, or very nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN France, the &s;eat of government not being in a great mercan|tile city, merchants do not make &s;o great a proportion of the peo|ple who advance money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the farmers general, the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm, the court bankers, &amp;c. make the greater part of tho&s;e who advance their money in all public exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but of great wealth, and fre|quently
<PB N="550" REF="552">
of great pride. They are too proud to marry thir equals, and women of quality di&s;dain to marry them. They frequently re&s;olve, therefore, to live bachelors, and having neither any fami|lies of their own, nor much regard for tho&s;e of their relations, whom they are not always very fond of acknowledging, they de&s;ire only to live in &s;plendor during their own time, and are not unwil|ling that their fortune &s;hould end with them&s;elves. The number of rich people, be&s;ides, who are either aver&s;e to marry, or who&s;e condition of life renders it either improper or inconvenient for them to do &s;o, is much greater in France than in England. To &s;uch people, who have little or no care for po&s;terity, nothing can be more convenient than to exchange their capital for a revenue, which is to la&s;t ju&s;t as long as, and no longer than, they wi&s;h it to do.</P>
<P>THE ordinary expence of the greater part of modern govern|ments in time of peace being equal or nearly equal to their ordi|nary revenue, when war comes they are both unwilling and unable to increa&s;e their revenue in proportion to the increa&s;e of their ex|pence. They are unwilling, for fear of offending the people, who, by &s;o great and &s;o &s;udden an increa&s;e of taxes, would &s;oon be di&s;|gu&s;ted with the war; and they are unable, from not well know|ing what taxes would be &s;ufficient to produce the revenue wanted. The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarra&s;&s;ment which this fear and inability would otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion. By means of borrowing they are enabled, with a very moderate increa&s;e of taxes, to rai&s;e, from year to year, money &s;ufficient for carrying on the war, and by the practice of perpetual funding they are enabled, with the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible increa&s;e of taxes, to rai&s;e annually the large&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;um of money. In great empires the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote from the &s;cene of action, feel, many of them, &s;carce any inconveniency from the
<PB N="551" REF="553">
war; but enjoy, at their ea&s;e, the amu&s;ement of reading in the news-papers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this amu&s;ement compen&s;ates the &s;mall difference between the taxes which they pay on account of the war, and tho&s;e which they had been accu&s;tomed to pay in time of peace. They are commonly di&s;&s;atisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amu&s;ement, and to a thou&s;and vi&s;ionary hopes of conque&s;t, and national glory, from a longer continuance of the war.</P>
<P>THE return of peace, indeed, &s;eldom relieves them from the greater part of the taxes impo&s;ed during the war. The&s;e are mort|gaged for the intere&s;t of the debt contracted in order to carry it on. If, over and above paying the intere&s;t of this debt, and defraying the ordinary expence of government, the old revenue, together with the new taxes, produce &s;ome &s;urplus revenue, it may perhaps be converted into a &s;inking fund for paying off the debt. But, in the fir&s;t place, this &s;inking fund, even &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould be applied to no other purpo&s;e, is generally altogether inadequate for paying, in the cour&s;e of any period during which it can rea&s;onably be expected that peace &s;hould continue, the whole debt contracted during the war; and, in the &s;econd place, this fund is almo&s;t always applied to other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE new taxes were impo&s;ed for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of paying the intere&s;t of the money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally &s;omething which was neither intended nor expected, and is therefore &s;eldom very con&s;iderable. Sinking funds have gene|rally ari&s;en, not &s;o much from any &s;urplus of the taxes which was over and above what was nece&s;&s;ary for paying the intere&s;t or an|nuity originally charged upon them, as from a &s;ub&s;equent reduc|tion of that intere&s;t. That of Holland in 1655, and that of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate in 1685, were both formed in this manner. Hence the u&s;ual in&s;ufficiency of &s;uch funds.</P>
<P><PB N="552" REF="554">
DURING the mo&s;t profound peace, various events occur which require an extraordinary expence, and government finds it always more convenient to defray this expence by mi&s;applying the &s;inking fund than by impo&s;ing a new tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or le&s;s by the people. It occa&s;ions always &s;ome mur|mur, and meets with &s;ome oppo&s;ition. The more taxes may have been multiplied, the higher they may have been rai&s;ed upon every different &s;ubject of taxation; the more loudly the people complain of every new tax, the more difficult it becomes too either to find out new &s;ubjects of taxation, or to rai&s;e much higher the taxes already impo&s;ed upon the old. A momentary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the payment of debt is not immediately felt by the people, and occa|&s;ions neither murmur nor complaint. To borrow of the &s;inking fund is always an obvious and ea&s;y expedient for getting out of the pre&s;ent difficulty. The more the public debts may have been accu|mulated, the more nece&s;&s;ary it may have become to &s;tudy to reduce them, the more dangerous, the more ruinous it may be to mi&s;apply any part of the &s;inking fund; the le&s;s likely is the public debt to be reduced to any con&s;iderable degree, the more likely, the more certainly is the &s;inking fund to be mi&s;applied towards defraying all the extraordinary expences which occur in time of peace. When a nation is already overburdened with taxes, nothing but the nece&s;&s;ities of a new war, nothing but either the animo&s;ity of national vengeance, or the anxiety for national &s;ecurity, can induce the people to &s;ub|mit, with tolerable patience, to a new tax. Hence the u&s;ual mi&s;|application of the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>IN Great Britain, from the time that we had fir&s;t recour&s;e to the ruinous expedient of perpetual funding, the reduction of the pub|lic debt in time of peace, has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of war. It was in the war which began in 1688, and was concluded by the treaty of Ry&s;wick in 1697, that the foundation of the pre&s;ent enormous debt of Great Britain was fir&s;t laid.</P>
<P><PB N="553" REF="555">
ON the 31&s;t of December, 1697, the public debts of Great Bri|tain, funded and unfunded, amounted to 21,515,742l. 13s. 8&frac12;d. A great part of tho&s;e debts had been contracted upon &s;hort anti|cipations, and &s;ome part upon annuities for lives; &s;o that before the 31&s;t of December, 1701, in le&s;s than four years, there had partly been paid off, and partly reverted to the public, the &s;um of 5,121,041l. 12s. 0&frac34;d.; a greater reduction of the public debt than has ever &s;ince been brought about in &s;o &s;hort a period of time. The remaining debt, therefore, amounted only to 16,394,701l. 1s. 7&frac14;d.</P>
<P>IN the war which began in 1702, and which was concluded by the treaty of Utrecht, the public debts were &s;till more accumu|lated. On the 31&s;t of December, 1714, they amounted to 53,681,076l. 5s. 61/12d. The &s;ub&s;cription into the South Sea fund of the long and &s;hort annuities increa&s;ed the capital of the public debts, &s;o that on the 31&s;t of December, 1722, it amounted to 55,282,978l. 1s. 35/6d. The reduction of the debt began in 1723, and went on &s;o &s;lowly that, on the 31&s;t of December, 1739, during &s;eventeen years of profound peace, the whole &s;um paid off was no more than 8,328,354l. 17s. 113/12d. the capital of the public debt at that time amounting to 46,954,623l. 3s. 47/12d.</P>
<P>THE Spani&s;h war, which began in 1739, and the French war which &s;oon followed it, occa&s;ioned a further encrea&s;e of the debt, which, on the 31&s;t of December, 1748, after the war had been concluded by the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, amounted to 78,293,313l. 1s. 10&frac34;d. The mo&s;t profound peace of &s;eventeen years continuance had taken no more than 8,328,354l. 17s. 113/12d. from it. A war of le&s;s than nine years continuance added 31,338,689l. 18s. 61/6d. to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See James Po&s;tlethwaite's hi&s;tory of the public revenue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the admini&s;tration of Mr. Pelham, the intere&s;t of the public debt was reduced, or at lea&s;t mea&s;ures were taken for reduce|ing

it, from four to three per cent.; the &s;inking fund was increa&s;ed, and &s;ome part of the public debt was paid off. In 1755, before the breaking out of the late war, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 72,289,673l. On the 5th of January, 1763, at the conclu&s;ion of the peace, the funded debt amounted to 122,603,336l. 8s. 2&frac14;d. The unfunded debt has been &s;tated at 13,927,589l. 2s. 2d. But the expence occa&s;ioned by the war did not end with the conclu&s;ion of the peace; &s;o that though on the 5th of Janu|ary, 1764, the funded debt was increa&s;ed (partly by a new loan, and partly by funding a part of the unfunded debt) to 129,586,789l. 10s. 1&frac34;d. there &s;till remained (according to the very well informed author of the Con&s;iderations on the trade and finances of Great Britain) an unfunded debt, which was brought to account in that and the following year, of 9,975,017l. 12s. 215/44d. In 1764, therefore, the public debt of Great Britain, funded and unfunded together, amounted, according to this author, to 139,561,807l. 2s. 4d. The annuities for lives too, which had been granted as premiums to the &s;ub&s;cribers to the new loans in 1757, e&s;timated at fourteen years purcha&s;e, were valued at 472,500l.; and the annuities for long terms of years, granted as premiums likewi&s;e, in 1761 and 1762, e&s;timated at 27&frac12; years purcha&s;e, were valued at 6,826,875l. During a peace of about &s;even years continuance, the prudent and truly patriot admini&s;tra|tion of Mr. Pelham, was not able to pay off an old debt of &s;ix millions. During a war of nearly the &s;ame continuance, a new debt of more than &s;eventy-five millions was contracted.</P>
<P>ON the 5th of January, 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 124,996,086l. 1s. 6&frac14;d. The unfunded, exclu&s;ive of a large civil li&s;t debt, to 4,150,236l. 3s. 117/8d. Both together, to 129,146,322l. 5s. 6d. According to this account the whole debt paid off during eleven years profound peace amounted only to 10,415,474l. 16s. 97/8d. Even this
<PB N="555" REF="557">
&s;mall reduction of debt, however, has not been all made from the &s;avings out of the ordinary revenue of the &s;tate. Several extraneous &s;ums, altogether independant of that ordinary revenue, have contributed towards it. Among the&s;e we may reckon an additional &s;hilling in the pound land tax for three years; the two millions received from the Ea&s;t India company, as indemnification for their territorial acqui&s;itions; and the one hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter. To the&s;e mu&s;t be added &s;everal other &s;ums which, as they aro&s;e out of the late war, ought perhaps to be con&s;idered as deductions from the expences of it. The prin|cipal are,

If we add to this &s;um the balance of the earl of Chatham's and Mr. Calcra&s;t's accounts, and other army &s;avings of the &s;ame kind, together with what has been received from the bank, the Ea&s;t India company, and the additional &s;hilling in the pound, land tax; the whole mu&s;t be a good deal more than five millions. The debt, therefore, which &s;ince the peace has been paid out of the &s;avings from the ordinary revenue of the &s;tage, has not, one year with another, amounted to half a million a year. The &s;inking fund has, no doubt, been con&s;iderably augmented &s;ince the peace, by the debt which has been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per cents. to three per cents. and by the annuities for lives which have fallen in, and, if peace was to continue,
<PB N="556" REF="558">
a million perhaps might now be annually &s;pared out of it towards the di&s;charge of the debt. Another million, accordingly, was paid in the cour&s;e of la&s;t year; but, at the &s;ame time, a large civil li&s;t debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in a new war which, in its progre&s;s, may prove as expen&s;ive as any of our former wars. The new debt which will probably be con|tracted before the end of the next campaign, may perhaps be nearly equal to all the old debt which has been paid off from the &s;avings out of the ordinary revenue of the &s;tate. It would be altogether chimerical, therefore, to expect that the public debt &s;hould ever be completely di&s;charged by any &s;avings which are likely to be made from that ordinary revenue as it &s;tands at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particularly tho&s;e of England, have by one author been repre|&s;ented as the accumulation of a great capital &s;uper-added to the other capital of the country, by means of which its trade is ex|tended, its manufactures multiplied, and its lands cultivated and improved much beyond what they could have been by means of that other capital only. He does not con&s;ider that the capital which the fir&s;t creditors of the public advanced to government, was, from the moment in which they advanced it, a certain por|tion of the annual produce turned away from &s;erving in the function of a capital, to &s;erve in that of a revenue; from main|taining productive labourers to maintain unproductive ones, and to be &s;pent and wa&s;ted, generally in the cour&s;e of the year, without even the hope of any future reproduction. In return for the capital which they advanced they obtained, indeed, an annuity in the public funds in mo&s;t ca&s;es of more than equal value. This annuity, no doubt, replaced to them their capital, and enabled them to carry on their trade and bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;ame or perhaps to a greater extent than before; that is, they were enabled either
<PB N="557" REF="559">
to borrow of other people a new capital upon the credit of this annuity, or by &s;elling it to get from other people a new capital of their own, equal or &s;uperior to that which they had advanced to government. This new capital, however, which they in this manner either bought or borrowed of other people, mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in the country before, and mu&s;t have been employed, as all capitals are, in maintaining productive labour. When it came into the hands of tho&s;e who had advanced their money to govern|ment, though it was in &s;ome re&s;pects a new capital to them, it was not &s;o to the country; but was only a capital withdrawn from certain employments in order to be turned towards others. Though it replaced to them what they had advanced to government, it did not replace it to the country. Had they not advanced this capital to government, there would have been in the country two capitals, two portions of the annual produce, in&s;tead of one, em|ployed in maintaining productive labour.</P>
<P>WHEN for defraying the expence of government a revenue is rai&s;ed within the year from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain portion of the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one &s;pecies of unproductive labour, towards maintaining another. Some part of what they pay in tho&s;e taxes might no doubt have been accumulated into capital, and con&s;equently employed in maintaining productive labour; but the greater part would probably have been &s;pent and con&s;equently em|ployed in maintaining unproductive labour. The public expence however, when defrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders more or le&s;s the further accumulation of new capital; but it does not ne|ce&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion the de&s;truction of any actually exi&s;ting capital.</P>
<P>WHEN the publick expence is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the annual de&s;truction of &s;ome capital which had before exi&s;ted

in the country; by the perver&s;ion of &s;ome portion of the annual produce which had before been de&s;tined for the maintenance of productive labour, towards that of unproductive labour. As in this ca&s;e, however, the taxes are lighter than they would have been, had a revenue &s;ufficient for defraying the &s;ame expence been rai&s;ed within the year; the private revenue of individuals is nece&s;|&s;arily le&s;s burthened, and con&s;equently their ability to &s;ave and accu|mulate &s;ome part of that revenue into capital is a good deal le&s;s impaired. If the method of funding de&s;troys more old capital, it at the &s;ame time hinders le&s;s the accumulation or acqui&s;ition of new capital, than that of defraying the public expence by a revenue rai&s;ed within the year. Under the &s;y&s;tem of funding, the frugality and indu&s;try of private people can more ea&s;ily repair the breaches which the wa&s;te and extravagance of government may occa&s;ionally make in the general capital of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IT is only during the continuance of war, however, that the &s;y&s;tem of funding has this advantage over the other &s;y&s;tem. Were the expence of war to be defrayed always by a revenue rai&s;ed within the year, the taxes from which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would la&s;t no longer than the war. The ability of private people to accumulate, though le&s;s during the war, would have been greater during the peace than under the &s;y&s;tem of funding. War would not nece&s;&s;arily have occa&s;ioned the de&s;truc|tion of any old capitals, and peace would have occa&s;ioned the accumulation of many more new. Wars would in general be more &s;peedily concluded, and le&s;s wantonly undertaken. The peo|ple feeling, during the continuance of the war, the complete burden of it, would &s;oon grow weary of it, and government, in order to humour them, would not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of carry|ing it on longer than it was nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o. The fore&s;ight of the heavy and unavoidable burdens of war would hinder the
<PB N="559" REF="561">
people from wantonly calling for it when there was no real or &s;olid intere&s;t to fight for. The &s;ea&s;ons during which the ability of private people to accumulate was &s;omewhat impaired, would occur more rarely, and be of &s;horter continuance. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, during which that ability was in the highe&s;t vigour, would be of much longer duration than they can well be under the &s;y&s;tem of funding.</P>
<P>WHEN funding, be&s;ides, has made a certain progre&s;s, the mul|tiplication of taxes which it brings along with it &s;ometimes im|pairs as much the ability of private people to accumulate even in time of peace, as the other &s;y&s;tem would in time of war. The peace revenue of Great Britain amounts at pre&s;ent to more than ten millions a year. If free and unmortgaged, it might be &s;ufficient, with proper management and without contracting a &s;hilling of new debt, to carry on the mo&s;t vigorous war. The private revenue of the inhabitants of Great Britain is at pre&s;ent as much encum|bered in time of peace, their ability to accumulate is as much impaired as it would have been in the time of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive war, had the pernicious &s;y&s;tem of funding never been adopted.</P>
<P>IN the payment of the intere&s;t of the public debt, it has been &s;aid, it is the right hand which pays the left. The money does not go out of the country. It is only a part of the revenue of one &s;et of the inhabitants which is transferred to another; and the nation is not a farthing the poorer. This apology is founded altogether in the &s;ophi&s;try of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, and after the long examination which I have already be&s;towed upon that &s;y&s;tem, it may perhaps be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing further about it. It &s;uppo&s;es, be&s;ides, that the whole public debt is owing to the inha|bitants of the country, which happens not to be true; the Dutch, as well as &s;everal other foreign nations, having a very con&s;iderable
<PB N="560" REF="562">
&s;hare in our public funds. But though the whole debt were owing to the inhabitants of the country, it would not upon that account be le&s;s pernicious.</P>
<P>LAND and capital &s;tock are the two original &s;ources of all re|venue both private and public. Capital &s;tock pays the wages of productive labour, whether employed in agriculture, manufactures, or commerce. The management of tho&s;e two original &s;ources of revenue belongs to two different &s;etts of people; the proprietors of land, and the owners or employers of capital &s;tock.</P>
<P>THE proprietor of land is intere&s;ted for the &s;ake of his own revenue to keep his e&s;tate in as good condition as he can, by build|ing and repairing his tenants hou&s;es, by making and maintaining the nece&s;&s;ary drains and enclo&s;ures, and all tho&s;e other expen&s;ive improvements which it properly belongs to the landlord to make and maintain. But by different land-taxes the revenue of the landlord may be &s;o much dimini&s;hed; and by different duties upon the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, that dimini&s;hed revenue may be rendered of &s;o little real value, that he may find him&s;elf altogether unable to make or maintain tho&s;e expen&s;ive improve|ments. When the landlord, however, cea&s;es to do his part, it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible that the tenant &s;hould continue to do his. As the di&s;tre&s;s of the landlord increa&s;es, the agriculture of the country mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily decline.</P>
<P>WHEN by different taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, the owners and employers of capital &s;tock find, that what|ever revenue they derive from it, will not, in a particular country, purcha&s;e the &s;ame quantity of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies, which an equal revenue would in almo&s;t any other; they will be di&s;po&s;ed to remove to &s;ome other. And when, in order to rai&s;e tho&s;e
<PB N="561" REF="563">
taxes, all or the greater part of merchants and manufacturers, that is, all or the greater part of the employers of great capitals, come to be continually expo&s;ed to the mortifying and vexatious vi&s;its of the tax gatherers; this di&s;po&s;ition to remove will &s;oon be changed into an actual removal. The indu&s;try of the country will nece&s;|&s;arily fall with the removal of the capital which &s;upported it, and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the declen&s;ion of agriculture.</P>
<P>To transfer from the owners of tho&s;e two great &s;ources of reve|nue, land and capital &s;tock, from the per&s;ons immediately intere&s;ted in the good condition of every particular portion of land, and in the good management of every particular portion of capital &s;tock, to another &s;ett of per&s;ons, (the creditors of the public, who have no &s;uch particular intere&s;t) the greater part of the revenue ari&s;ing from either, mu&s;t, in the long-run, occa&s;ion both the neglect of land, and the wa&s;te or removal of capital &s;tock. A creditor of the public has no doubt a general intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the agri|culture, manufactures, and commerce of the country; and con|&s;equently in the good condition of its lands, and in the good ma|nagement of its capital &s;tock. Should there be any general failure or declen&s;ion in any of the&s;e things, the produce of the different taxes might no longer be &s;ufficient to pay him the annuity or in|tere&s;t which is due to him. But a creditor of the public, con|&s;idered merely as &s;uch, has no intere&s;t in the good condition of any particular portion of land, or in the good management of any particular portion of capital &s;tock. As a creditor of the public he has no knowledge of any &s;uch particular portion. He has no in&s;pection of it. He can have no care about it. Its ruin may in mo&s;t ca&s;es be unknown to him, and cannot directly affect him.</P>
<P>THE practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every &s;tate which has adopted it. The Italian republics &s;eem to have begun it.
<PB N="562" REF="564">
Genoa and Venice, the only two remaining which can pretend to an independent exi&s;tence, have both been enfeebled by it. Spain &s;eems to have learned the practice from the Italian republics, and (its taxes being probably le&s;s judicious than theirs) it has, in pro|portion to its natural &s;trength, been &s;till more enfeebled. The debts of Spain are of very old &s;tanding. It was deeply in debt be|fore the end of the &s;ixteenth century, about a hundred years before England owed a &s;hilling. France, notwith&s;tanding all its natural re&s;ources, langui&s;hes under an oppre&s;&s;ive load of the &s;ame kind. The republic of the United Provinces is as much enfeebled by its debts as either Genoa or Venice. Is it likely that in Great Britain alone a practice, which has brought either weakne&s;s or de|&s;olation into every other country, &s;hould prove altogether inno|cent?</P>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of taxation e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e different countries, it may be &s;aid, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is &s;o. But it ought to be remembered, that when the wi&s;e&s;t government has exhau&s;ted all the proper &s;ubjects of taxation, it mu&s;t, in ca&s;es of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, have recour&s;e to improper ones. The wi&s;e republic of Holland has upon &s;ome occa&s;ions been obliged to have recour&s;e to taxes as inconvenient as the greater part of tho&s;e of Spain. Another war begun before any con&s;iderable liberation of the publick revenue had been brought about, and growing in its progre&s;s as expen&s;ive as the la&s;t war, may, from irre&s;i&s;table nece&s;&s;ity, render the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of taxation as oppre&s;&s;ive as that of Hol|land, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of taxation, indeed, it has hitherto given &s;o little embar|ra&s;&s;ment to indu&s;try, that, during the cour&s;e even of the mo&s;t ex|pen&s;ive wars, the frugality and good conduct of individuals &s;eems to have been able, by &s;aving and accumulation, to repair all the breaches which the wa&s;te and extravagance of government had
<PB N="563" REF="565">
made in the general capital of the &s;ociety. At the conclu&s;ion of the late war, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive that Great Britain ever waged, her agriculture was as flouri&s;hing, her manufacturers as numerous and as fully employed, and her commerce as exten&s;ive, as they had ever been before. The capital, therefore, which &s;upported all tho&s;e different branches of indu&s;try, mu&s;t have been equal to what it had ever been before. Since the peace, agriculture has been &s;till further improved, the rents of hou&s;es have ri&s;en in every town and village of the country, a proof of the increa&s;ing wealth and reve|nue of the people; and the annual amount of the greater part of the old taxes, of the principal branches of the exci&s;e and cu&s;toms in particular, has been continually increa&s;ing, an equally clear proof of an increa&s;ing con&s;umption, and con&s;equently of an in|crea&s;ing produce, which could alone &s;upport that con&s;umption. Great Britain &s;eems to &s;upport with ea&s;e, a burden which, half a century ago, nobody believed her capable of &s;upporting. Let us not, however, upon this account ra&s;hly conclude that &s;he is capa|ble of &s;upporting any burden; nor even be too confident that &s;he could &s;upport, without great di&s;tre&s;s, a burden a little greater than what has already been laid upon her.</P>
<P>WHEN national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is &s;carce, I believe, a &s;ingle in&s;tance of their having been fairly and completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been brought about at all, has always been brought about by a bankruptcy; &s;ometimes by an avowed one, but always by a real one, though frequently by a pretended pay|ment.</P>
<P>THE rai&s;ing of the denomination of the coin has been the mo&s;t u&s;ual expedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been di&s;|gui&s;ed under the appearance of a pretended payment. If a &s;ixpence,
<PB N="564" REF="566">
for example, &s;hould either by act of parliament or royal procla|mation be rai&s;ed to the denomination of a &s;hilling, and twenty &s;ix|pences to that of a pound &s;terling; the per&s;on who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty &s;hillings, or near four ounces of &s;ilver, would, under the new, pay with twenty &s;ixpences, or with &s;omething le&s;s than two ounces. A national debt of about a hundred and twenty-eight millions, nearly the capital of the funded and unfunded debt of Great Britain, might in this manner be paid with about &s;ixty-four millions of our pre&s;ent money. It would indeed be a pretended payment only, and the creditors of the public would really be defrauded of ten &s;hillings in the pound of what was due to them. The calamity too would extend much further than to the creditors of the public, and tho&s;e of every private per&s;on would &s;uffer a proportionable lo&s;s; and this without any advantage, but in mo&s;t ca&s;es with a great additional lo&s;s, to the creditors of the public. If the creditors of the public indeed were generally much in debt to other people, they might in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ate their lo&s;s by paying their creditors in the &s;ame coin in which the public had paid them. But in mo&s;t countries the creditors of the public are, the greater part of them, wealthy people, who &s;tand more in the relation of creditors than in that of debtors towards the re&s;t of their fellow citizens. A pretended payment of this kind, therefore, in&s;tead of alleviating, aggravates in mo&s;t ca&s;es the lo&s;s of the creditors of the public; and with|out any advantage to the public extends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people. It occa&s;ions a general and mo&s;t pernicious &s;ubver&s;ion of the fortunes of private people; enriching in mo&s;t ca&s;es the idle and profu&s;e debtor at the expence of the indu&s;trious and frugal creditor, and tran&s;porting a great part of the national capital, from the hands which were likely to encrea&s;e and improve it, to tho&s;e which are likely to di&s;&s;ipate and de&s;troy it. When it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;tate to di&s;&s;ipate and de&s;troy it. When it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;tate to
<PB N="565" REF="567">
declare it&s;elf bankrupt, in the &s;ame manner as when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for an individual to do &s;o, a fair, open, and avowed bank|ruptcy is always the mea&s;ure which is both lea&s;t di&s;honourable to the debtor, and lea&s;t hurtful to the creditor. The honour of a &s;tate is &s;urely very poorly provided for, when, in order to cover the di&s;grace of a real bankruptcy, it has recour&s;e to a juggling trick of this kind, &s;o ea&s;ily &s;een through, and at the &s;ame time &s;o extremely pernicious.</P>
<P>ALMOST all &s;tates, however, antient as well as modern, when reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, have, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, played this very juggling trick. The Romans, at the end of the fir&s;t punic war, reduced the As, the coin or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other coins, from containing twelve ounces of copper to contain only two ounces; that is, they rai&s;ed two ounces of copper to a denomination which had always before expre&s;&s;ed the value of twelve ounces. The republic was, in this manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted with the &s;ixth part of what it really owed. So &s;udden and &s;o great a bankruptcy, we &s;hould in the pre&s;ent times be apt to imagine, mu&s;t have occa|&s;ioned a very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have occa&s;ioned any. The law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating to the coin, introduced and carried through the a&s;&s;embly of the people by a tribune, and was probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all the other antient republics, the poor people were con&s;tantly in debt to the rich and the great, who, in order to &s;ecure their votes at the annual elections, u&s;ed to lend them money at exorbitant intere&s;t, which, being never paid, &s;oon accumulated into a &s;um too great either for the debtor to pay, or for any body el&s;e to pay for him. The debtor, for fear of a very &s;evere execu|tion, was obliged, without any further gratuity, to vote for the candidate whom the creditor recommended. In &s;pite of all the
<PB N="566" REF="568">
laws again&s;t bribery and corruption, the bounty of the candidates, together with the occa&s;ional di&s;tributions of corn, which were ordered by the &s;enate, were the principal funds from which, during the later times of the Roman republic, the poorer citizens derived their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. To deliver them&s;elves from this &s;ubjection to their creditors, the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for an entire abolition of debts, or for what they called New Tables; that is, for a law which &s;hould entitle them to a complete acquittance, upon paying only a certain proportion of their accu|mulated debts. The law which reduced the coin of all denomina|tions to a &s;ixth part of its former value, as it enabled them to pay their debts with a &s;ixth part of what they really owed, was equiva|lent to the mo&s;t advantageous new tables. In order, to &s;atisfy the people, the rich and the great were, upon &s;everal different occa|&s;ions, obliged to con&s;ent to laws both for aboli&s;hing debts, and for introducing new tables; and they probably were induced to con|&s;ent to this law, partly for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and partly that by libe|rating the public revenue, they might re&s;tore vigour to that govern|ment of which they them&s;elves had the principal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions to twenty-one millions, three hundred and thirty-three thou&s;and, three hundred and thirty-three pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence. In the cour&s;e of the &s;econd punic war the As was &s;till further reduced, fir&s;t, from two ounces of copper to one ounce; and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce; that is, to the twenty-fourth part of its original value. By combining the three Roman operations into one, a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions of our pre&s;ent money, might in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of five millions, three hundred and thirty-three thou&s;and, three hundred and thirty-three pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence. Even the enormous debt of Great Britain might in this manner &s;oon be paid.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="569">
BY means of &s;uch expedients the coin of, I believe, all nations has been gradually reduced more and more below its original value, and the &s;ame nominal &s;um has been gradually brought to contain a &s;maller and a &s;maller quantity of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>NATIONS have &s;ometimes, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, adulterated the &s;tandard of their coin; that is, have mixed a greater quantity of alloy in it. If in the pound weight of our &s;ilver coin, for exam|ple, in&s;tead of eighteen penny weight, according to the pre&s;ent &s;tandard, there was mixed eight ounces of alloy; a pound &s;terling, or twenty &s;hillings of &s;uch coin, would be worth little more than &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence of our pre&s;ent money. The quan|tity of &s;ilver contained in &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence of our pre|&s;ent money, would thus be rai&s;ed very nearly to the denomination of a pound &s;terling. The adulteration of the &s;tandard has exactly the &s;ame effect with what the French call an augmentation, or a direct rai&s;ing of the denomination of the coin.</P>
<P>AN augmentation, or a direct rai&s;ing of the denomination of the coin, always is, and from its nature mu&s;t be, an open and avowed operation. By means of it pieces of a &s;maller weight and bulk are called by the &s;ame name which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk. The adulteration of the &s;tandard, on the contrary, has generally been a concealed operation. By means of it pieces were i&s;&s;ued from the mint of the &s;ame denominations, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the &s;ame weight, bulk, and appearance, with pieces which had been current before of much greater value. When king John of France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See du Cange Glo&s;&s;ary, voce Moneta; the Benedictine edition.</NOTE>, in order to pay his debts, adulterated his coin, all the officers of his mint were &s;worn to &s;ecre&s;y. Both operations are unju&s;t. But a &s;imple augmenta|tion is an inju&s;tice of open violence; whereas an adulteration is an inju&s;tice of treacherous fraud. This latter operation, therefore, as
<PB N="568" REF="570">
&s;oon as it has been di&s;covered, and it could never be concealed very long, has always excited much greater indignation than the former. The coin, after any con&s;iderable augmentation, has very &s;eldom been brought back to its former weight; but after the greate&s;t adulterations it has almo&s;t always been brought back to its former finene&s;s. It has &s;carce ever happened that the fury and indignation of the people could otherwi&s;e be appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN the end of the reign of Henry VIII. and in the beginning of that of Edward VI. the Engli&s;h coin was not only rai&s;ed in its denomination, but adulterated in its &s;tandard. The like frauds were practi&s;ed in Scotland during the minority of James VI. They have occa&s;ionally been practi&s;ed in mo&s;t other countries.</P>
<P>THAT the public revenue of Great Britain can ever be com|pletely liberated, or even that any con&s;iderable progre&s;s can ever be made towards that liberation, while the &s;urplus of that revenue, or what is over and above defraying the annual expence of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, is &s;o very &s;mall, it &s;eems altogether in vain to expect. That liberation, it is evident, can never be brought about without either &s;ome very con&s;iderable augmentation of the public revenue, or &s;ome equally con&s;iderable reduction of the public expence.</P>
<P>A MORE equal land-tax, a more equal tax upon the rent of hou&s;es, and &s;uch alterations in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e as tho&s;e which have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter, might, perhaps, without increa&s;ing the burden of the greater part of the people, but only di&s;tributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole, produce a con&s;iderable augmentation of revenue. The mo&s;t &s;anguine projector, however, could &s;carce flatter him&s;elf that any augmentation of this kind would be &s;uch as could give any rea&s;onable hopes either of liberating the public revenue alto|gether,
<PB N="569" REF="571">
or even of making &s;uch progre&s;s towards that liberation in time of peace, as either to prevent or to compen&s;ate the further accumulation of the public debt in the next war.</P>
<P>BY extending the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of taxation to all the different provinces of the empire inhabited by people either of Briti&s;h or Eu|ropean extraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected. This, however, could &s;carce perhaps be done, con&s;i&s;t|ently with the principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, without admit|ting into the Briti&s;h parliament, or if you will into the &s;tates gene|ral of the Briti&s;h Empire, a fair and equal repre&s;entation of all tho&s;e different provinces, that of each province bearing the &s;ame proportion to the produce of its taxes, as the repre&s;entation of Great Britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon Great Britain. The private intere&s;t of many powerful individuals, the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people &s;eem, indeed, at pre&s;ent, to oppo&s;e to &s;o great a change &s;uch ob&s;tacles as it may be very difficult, perhaps altogether impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;urmount. With|out, however, pretending to determine whether &s;uch a union be practicable or impracticable, it may not, perhaps, be improper, in a &s;peculative work of this kind, to con&s;ider how far the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of taxation might be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire; what revenue might be expected from it if &s;o applied, and in what manner a general union of this kind might be likely to affect the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the different pro|vinces comprehended within it. Such a &s;peculation can at wor&s;t be regarded but as a new Utopia, le&s;s amu&s;ing certainly, but not more u&s;ele&s;s and chimerical than the old one.</P>
<P>THE land-tax, the &s;tamp duties, and the different duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, con&s;titute the four principal branches of the Briti&s;h taxes.</P>
<P><PB N="570" REF="572">
IRELAND is certainly as able, and our American and We&s;t Indian plantations more able to pay a land-tax than Great Bri|tain. Where the landlord is &s;ubject neither to tithe nor poors rate, he mu&s;t certainly be more able to pay &s;uch a tax, than where he is &s;ubject to both tho&s;e other burdens. The tithe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind, dimini&s;hes more what would otherwi&s;e be the rent of the landlord, than a land|tax which really amounted to five &s;hillings in the pound. Such a tithe will be found in mo&s;t ca&s;es to amount to more than a fourth part of the real rent of the land, or of what remains after replacing compleatly the capital of the farmer, together with his rea&s;onable profit. If all modu&s;es and all impropriations were taken away, the complete church tithe of Great Britain and Ire|land, could not well be e&s;timated at le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even mil|lions. If there was no tithe either in Great Britain or Ireland, the landlords could afford to pay &s;ix or &s;even millions additional land-tax, without being more burdened than a very great part of them are at pre&s;ent. America pays no tithe, and could therefore very well afford to pay a land-tax. The lands in America and the We&s;t Indies, indeed, are in general not tenanted or lea&s;ed out to farmers. They could not therefore be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to any rent-roll. But neither were the lands of Great Britain, in the 4th of William and Mary, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to any rent|roll, but according to a very loo&s;e and inaccurate e&s;timation. The lands in America might be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either in the &s;ame manner, or according to an equitable valuation in con&s;equence of an accurate &s;urvey, like that which was lately made in the Milane&s;e, and in the dominions of Au&s;tria, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Sardinia.</P>
<P>STAMP-DUTIES, it is evident, might be levied without any variation in all countries where the forms of law proce&s;s, and the deeds by which property both real and per&s;onal is transferred, are the &s;ame or nearly the &s;ame.</P>

THE exten&s;ion of the cu&s;tomhou&s;e laws of Great Britain to Ireland and the plantations, provided it was accompanied, as in ju&s;tice it ought to be, with an exten&s;ion of the freedom of trade, would be in the highe&s;t degree advantageous to both. All the invidious re&s;traints which at pre&s;ent oppre&s;s the trade of Ireland, the di&s;tinction between the enumerated and non-enumerated com|modities of America, would be entirely at an end. The coun|tries north of Cape Fini&s;terre would be as open to every part of the produce of America, as tho&s;e &s;outh of that cape are to &s;ome parts of that produce at pre&s;ent. The trade between all the different parts of the Briti&s;h empire would, in con&s;equence of this uniformity in the cu&s;tomhou&s;e laws, be as free as the coa&s;t|ing trade of Great Britain is at pre&s;ent. The Briti&s;h empire would thus afford within it&s;elf an immen&s;e internal market for every part of the produce of all its different provinces. So great an exten&s;ion of market would &s;oon compen&s;ate both to Ireland and the plantations, all that they could &s;uffer from the increa&s;e of the duties of cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>THE exci&s;e is the only part of the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of taxation, which would require to be varied in any re&s;pect according as it was applied to the different provinces of the empire. It might be applied to Ireland without any variation; the produce and con&s;umption of that kingdom being exactly of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e of Great Britain. In its application to America and the We&s;t Indies, of which the produce and con&s;umption are &s;o very different from tho&s;e of Great Britain, &s;ome modification might be nece&s;&s;ary, in the &s;ame manner as in its application to the cyder and beer counties of England.</P>
<P>A FERMENTED liquor, for example, which is called beer, but which, as it is made of mela&s;&s;es, bears very little re&s;emblance to our beer, makes a con&s;iderable part of the common drink of the people in America. This liquor, as it can be kept only for a few
<PB N="572" REF="574">
days, cannot, like our beer, be prepared and &s;tored up for &s;ale in great breweries; but every private family mu&s;t brew it for their own u&s;e, in the &s;ame manner as they cook their victuals. But to &s;ubject every private family to the odious vi&s;its and examination of the tax gatherers, in the &s;ame manner as we &s;ubject the keepers of alehou&s;es and the brewers for public &s;ale, would be altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty. If for the &s;ake of equality it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to lay a tax upon this liquor, it might be taxed by taxing the material of which it is made, either at the place of manufacture, or, if the circum&s;tances of the trade ren|dered &s;uch an exci&s;e improper, by laying a duty upon its importa|tion into the colony in which it was to be con&s;umed. Be&s;ides the duty of one penny a gallon impo&s;ed by the Briti&s;h parliament upon the importation of mela&s;&s;es into America; there is a provincial tax of this kind upon their importation into Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, in &s;hips belonging to any other colony, of eight-pence the hog&s;head; and another upon their importation, from the northern colonies, into South Carolina of five-pence the gallon. Or if neither of the&s;e methods was found convenient, each family might compound for its con&s;umption of this liquor, either according to the number of per&s;ons of which it con&s;i&s;ted, in the &s;ame manner as private families compound for the malt-tax in England; or accoding to the different ages and &s;exes of tho&s;e per&s;ons, in the &s;ame manner as &s;everal different taxes are levied in Holland; or nearly as Sir Mathew Decker propo&s;es that all taxes upon con&s;umable com|modities &s;hould be levied in England. This mode of taxation, it has already been ob&s;erved, when applied to objects of a &s;peedy con&s;umption, is not a very convenient one. It might be adopted, however, in ca&s;es where no better could be done.</P>
<P>SUGAR, rum, and tobacco, are commodities which are no where nece&s;&s;aries of life, which are become objects of almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al con&s;umption, and which are therefore extreamly proper &s;ub|jects
<PB N="573" REF="575">
of taxation. If a union with the colonies was to take place, tho&s;e commodities might be taxed either before they go out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower; or if this mode of taxation did not &s;uit the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e per&s;ons, they might be depo&s;ited in public warehou&s;es both at the place of ma|nufacture, and at all the different ports of the empire to which they might afterwards be tran&s;ported, to remain there, under the joint cu&s;tody of the owner and the revenue officer, till &s;uch time as they &s;hould be delivered out either to the con&s;umer, to the merchant retailer for home con&s;umption, or to the merchant exporter; the tax not to be advanced till &s;uch delivery. When delivered out for exportation, to go duty free; upon proper &s;ecu|rity being given that they &s;hould really be exported out of the empire. The&s;e are perhaps the principal commodities with regard to which a union with the colonies might require &s;ome con&s;iderable change in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of Briti&s;h taxation.</P>
<P>WHAT might be the amount of the revenue which this &s;y&s;tem of taxation extended to all the different provinces of the empire might produce, it mu&s;t, no doubt, be altogether impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain with tolerable exactne&s;s. By means of this &s;y&s;tem there is annually levied in Great Britain; upon le&s;s than eight millions of people, more than ten millions of revenue. Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and according to the accounts laid before the congre&s;s, the twelve a&s;&s;ociated provinces of America contain more than three. Tho&s;e accounts, however, may have been exaggerated, in order, perhaps, either to encourage their own people, or to intimidate tho&s;e of this country, and we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e therefore that our North American and We&s;t Indian co|lonies taken together contain no more than three millions; or that the whole Briti&s;h empire, in Europe and America, contains no more than thirteen millions of inhabitants. If upon le&s;s than
<PB N="574" REF="576">
eight millions of inhabitants this &s;y&s;tem of taxation rai&s;es a re|venue of more than ten millions &s;terling; it ought upon thirteen millions of inhabitants to rai&s;e a revenue of more than &s;ixteen millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. From this revenue, &s;uppo&s;ing that this &s;y&s;tem could produce it, mu&s;t be deducted, the revenue u&s;ually rai&s;ed in Ireland and the planta|tions for defraying the expence of their re&s;pective civil govern|ments. The expence of the civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ireland, together with the intere&s;t of the public debt, amounts at a medium of the two years which ended March, 1775, to &s;omething le&s;s than &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds a year. By a very exact account of the revenue of the principal colonies of America and the We&s;t Indies, it amounted, before the commencement of the late di&s;turbances, to a hundred and forty-one thou&s;and eight hundred pounds. In this account, however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of all our late acqui&s;itions both upon the continent and in the i&s;lands, is omitted, which may perhaps make a difference of thirty or forty thou&s;and pounds. For the &s;ake of even numbers therefore, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the revenue nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the civil government of Ireland, and the plantations, may amount to a million. There would remain con&s;equently a revenue of fifteen millions two hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, to be applied towards defraying the general expence of the empire, and towards paying the public debt. But if from the pre&s;ent revenue of Great Britain a mil|lion could in peaceable times be &s;pared towards the payment of that debt, &s;ix millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds could very well be &s;pared from this improved revenue. This great &s;inking fund too might be augmented every year by the intere&s;t of the debt which had been di&s;charged the year before, and might in this manner increa&s;e &s;o very rapidly, as to be &s;ufficient in a few years to di&s;charge the whole debt, and thus to re&s;tore compleatly the at pre&s;ent debilitated and langui&s;hing vigour of the empire.
<PB N="575" REF="577">
In the meantime the people might be relieved from &s;ome of the mo&s;t burden&s;ome taxes; from tho&s;e which are impo&s;ed either upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, or upon the materials of manufacture. The labouring poor would thus be enabled to live better, to work cheaper, and to &s;end their goods cheaper to market. The cheap|ne&s;s of their goods would increa&s;e the demand for them, and con&s;equently for the labour of tho&s;e who produced them. This increa&s;e in the demand for labour, would both increa&s;e the numbers and improve the circum&s;tances of the labouring poor. Their con&s;umption would increa&s;e, and together with it the revenue ari&s;ing from all tho&s;e articles of their con&s;umption upon which the taxes might be allowed to remain.</P>
<P>THE revenue ari&s;ing from this &s;y&s;tem of taxation, however, might not immediately increa&s;e in proportion to the number of people who were &s;ubjected to it. Great indulgence would for &s;ome time be due to tho&s;e provinces of the empire which were thus &s;ub|jected to burthens to which they had not before been accu&s;tomed, and even when the &s;ame taxes came to be levied every where as exactly as po&s;&s;ible, they would not every where produce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a poor country the con&s;umption of the principal commodities &s;ubject to the duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e is very &s;mall; and in a thinly inhabited country the opportunities of &s;muggling are very great. The con|&s;umption of malt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in Scotland is very &s;mall, and the exci&s;e upon malt, beer, and ale, produces le&s;s there than in England in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of the duties, which upon malt is dif|ferent on account of a &s;uppo&s;ed difference of quality. In the&s;e particular branches of the exci&s;e there is not, I apprehend, much more &s;muggling in the one country than in the other. The duties upon the di&s;tillery, and the greater part of the duties of cu&s;toms,
<PB N="576" REF="578">
in proportion to the numbers of people in the re&s;pective countries, produce le&s;s in Scotland than in England, not only on account of the &s;maller con&s;umption of the taxed commodities, but of the much greater facility of &s;muggling. In Ireland, the inferior ranks of people are &s;till poorer than in Scotland, and many parts of the country are almo&s;t as thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the con&s;umption of the taxed commodities might, in proportion to the number of the people, be &s;till le&s;s than in Scotland, and the facility of &s;muggling nearly the &s;ame. In America and the We&s;t Indies the white people even of the lowe&s;t rank are in much better circum&s;tances than tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank in England, and their con&s;umption of all the luxuries in which they u&s;ually indulge them&s;elves is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed, who make the greater part of the inhabitants both of the &s;outhern colonies upon the continent and of the We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, as they are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, are, no doubt, in a wor&s;e condition than the poore&s;t people either in Scotland or Ireland. We mu&s;t not, however, upon that account, imagine that they are wor&s;e fed, or that their con&s;umption of articles which might be &s;ubjected to moderate duties, is le&s;s than that even of the lower ranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is the intere&s;t of their ma&s;ter that they &s;hould be fed well and kept in good heart, in the &s;ame manner as it is his intere&s;t that his working cattle &s;hould be &s;o. The blacks accordingly have almo&s;t every where their allowance of rum and of mela&s;&s;es or &s;pruce beer, in the &s;ame manner as the white &s;ervants; and this allowance would not probably be withdrawn, though tho&s;e articles &s;hould be &s;ub|jected to moderate duties. The con&s;umption of the taxed commodi|ties, therefore, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, would probably be as great in America and the We&s;t Indies as in any part of the Briti&s;h empire. The opportunities of &s;muggling, indeed, would be much greater; America, in proportion to the
<PB N="577" REF="579">
extent of the country, being much more thinly inhabited than either Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue, however, which is at pre&s;ent rai&s;ed by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors, was to be levied by a &s;ingle duty upon malt, the opportunity of &s;muggling in the mo&s;t important branch of the exci&s;e would be almo&s;t entirely taken away: And if the duties of cu&s;toms, in&s;tead of being impo&s;ed upon almo&s;t all the different artioles of impor|tation, were confined to a few of the mo&s;t general u&s;e and con|&s;umption, and if the levying of tho&s;e duties was &s;ubjected to the exci&s;e laws, the opportunity of &s;muggling, though not &s;o entirely taken away, would be very much dimini&s;hed. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e two, apparently, very &s;imple and ea&s;y alterations, the duties of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e might probably produce a revenue as great in proportion to the con&s;umption of the mo&s;t thinly inhabited pro|vince as they do at pre&s;ent in proportion to that of the mo&s;t po|pulous.</P>
<P>THE Americans, it has been &s;aid, indeed, have no gold or &s;ilver money; the interior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper currency, and the gold and &s;ilver which occa&s;ionally come among them being all &s;ent to Great Britain in return for the commodities which they receive from us. But without gold and &s;ilver, it is added, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of paying taxes. We already get all the gold and &s;ilver which they have. How is it po&s;&s;ible to draw from them what they have not?</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver money in America is not the effect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people there to purcha&s;e tho&s;e metals. In a country where the wages of labour are &s;o much higher, and the price of pro|vi&s;ions &s;o much lower than in England, the greater part of the people mu&s;t &s;urely have wherewithal to purcha&s;e a greater quantity,
<PB N="578" REF="580">
if it was either nece&s;&s;ary or convenient for them to do &s;o. The &s;carcity of tho&s;e metals, therefore, mu&s;t be the effect of choice, and not of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT is for tran&s;acting either dome&s;tic or foreign bu&s;ine&s;s, that gold and &s;ilver money is either nece&s;&s;ary or convenient.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s of every country, it has been &s;hewn in the &s;econd book of this inquiry, may, at lea&s;t in peaceable times, be tran&s;acted by means of a paper currency, with nearly the &s;ame degree of conveniency as by gold and &s;ilver money. It is con|venient for the Americans, who could always employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater &s;tock than they can ea&s;ily get, to &s;ave as much as po&s;&s;ible the expence of &s;o co&s;tly an in&s;trument of commerce as gold and &s;ilver, and rather to employ that part of their &s;urplus produce which would be nece&s;&s;ary for purcha&s;ing tho&s;e metals, in purcha&s;ing the in&s;truments of trade, the materials of cloathing, &s;everal parts of hou&s;hold furniture, and the iron-work nece&s;&s;ary for building and extending their &s;ettlements and plantations; in purcha&s;ing, not dead &s;tock, but active and productive &s;tock. The colony governments find it for their intere&s;t to &s;upply people with &s;uch a quantity of paper|money as is fully &s;ufficient and generally more than &s;ufficient for tran&s;acting their dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s. Some of tho&s;e governments, that of Pen&s;ylvania particularly, derive a revenue from lending this paper-money to their &s;ubjects at an intere&s;t of &s;o much per+cent. Others, like that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, advance upon extraordinary emergencies a paper-money of this kind for de|fraying the public expence, and afterwards, when it &s;uits the conveniency of the colony, redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls. In 1747 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hutchin&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, Vol. II. Page 436. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE> that colony paid, in this man|ner, the greater part of its public debts, with the tenth part of
<PB N="579" REF="581">
the money for which its bills had been granted. It &s;uits the con|veniency of the planters to &s;ave the expence of employing gold and &s;ilver money in their dome&s;tic tran&s;actions; and it &s;uits the conve|niency of the colony governments to &s;upply them with a medium, which, though attended with &s;ome very con&s;iderable di&s;advantages, enables them to &s;ave that expence. The redundancy of paper mo|ney nece&s;&s;arily bani&s;hes gold and &s;ilver from the dome&s;tic tran&s;ac|tions of the colonies, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it has bani&s;hed tho&s;e metals from the greater part of the dome&s;tic tran&s;actions of Scot|land; and in both countries it is not the poverty, but the enter|pri&s;ing and projecting &s;pirit of the people, their de&s;ire of employ|ing all the &s;tock which they can get as active and productive &s;tock, which has occa&s;ioned this redundancy of paper money.</P>
<P>IN the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with Great Britain, gold and &s;ilver are more or le&s;s employed, exactly in proportion as they are more or le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. Where tho&s;e metals are not nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;eldom appear. Where they are nece&s;&s;ary, they are generally found.</P>
<P>IN the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colo|nies, the Briti&s;h goods are generally advanced to the coloni&s;ts at a pretty long credit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price. It is more convenient for the coloni&s;ts to pay in tobacco than in gold and &s;ilver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods which his corre&s;pondents had &s;old to him in &s;ome other &s;ort of goods which he might happen to deal in, than in money. Such a merchant would have no occa&s;ion to keep any part of his &s;tock by him unemployed, and in ready money, for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands. He could have, at all times, a larger quantity of goods in his &s;hop or warehou&s;e, and he could deal to a greater extent. But it &s;eldom happens to be con|venient
<PB N="580" REF="582">
for all the corre&s;pondents of a merchant to receive pay|ment for the goods which they &s;ell to him, in goods of &s;ome other kind which he happens to deal in. The Briti&s;h merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular &s;ett of corre&s;pondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive payment for the goods which they &s;ell to tho&s;e colonies in tobacco than in gold and &s;ilver. They expect to make a profit by the &s;ale of the tobacco. They could make none by that of the gold and &s;ilver. Gold and &s;ilver, therefore, very &s;eldom appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies. Maryland and Virginia have as little occa&s;ion for tho&s;e metals in their foreign as in their dome&s;tic commerce. They are &s;aid, accordingly, to have le&s;s gold and &s;ilver money than any other colonies in Ame|rica. They are reckoned, however, as thriving, and con&s;equently as rich as any of their neighbours.</P>
<P>IN the northern colonies, Pen&s;ylvania, New York, New Jer&s;ey, the four governments of New England, &amp;c. the value of their own produce which they export to Great Britain is not equal to that of the manufactures which they import for their own u&s;e, and for that of &s;ome of the other colonies to which they are the carriers. A balance, therefore, mu&s;t be paid to the mother country in gold and &s;ilver, and this balance they generally find.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ugar colonies the value of the produce annually exported to Great Britain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from thence. If the &s;ugar and rum annually &s;ent to the mother country were paid for in tho&s;e colonies, Great Britain would be obliged to &s;end out every year a very large balance in money, and the trade to the We&s;t Indies would, by a certain &s;pecies of politi|cians, be con&s;idered as extremely di&s;advantageous. But it &s;o hap|pens, that many of the principal proprietors of the &s;ugar planta|tions re&s;ide in Great Britain. Their rents are remitted to them in
<PB N="581" REF="583">
&s;ugar and rum, the produce of their e&s;tates. The &s;ugar and rum which the We&s;t India merchants purcha&s;e in tho&s;e colonies upon their own account, are not equal in value to the goods which they annually &s;ell there. A balance, therefore, mu&s;t generally be paid to them in gold and &s;ilver, and this balance too is generally found.</P>
<P>THE difficulty and irregularity of payment from the different colonies to Great Britain, have not been at all in proportion to the greatne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of the balances which were re&s;pectively due from them. Payments have in general been more regular from the northern than from the tobacco colonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large balance in money, while the lat|ter have paid either no balance, or a much &s;maller one. The diffi|culty of getting payment from our different &s;ugar colonies has been greater or le&s;s in proportion, not &s;o much to the extent of the balances re&s;pectively due from them, as to the quantity of uncul|tivated land which they contained; that is, to the greater or &s;maller temptation which the planters have been under of over-trading, or of undertaking the &s;ettlement and plantation of greater quantities of wa&s;te land than &s;uited the extent of their capitals. The returns from the great i&s;land of Jamaica, where there is &s;till much uncul|tivated land, have, upon this account, been in general more irre|gular and uncertain than tho&s;e from the &s;maller i&s;lands of Barba|does, Antigua, and St. Chri&s;tophers, which have for the&s;e many years been completely cultivated, and have, upon that account, afforded le&s;s field for the &s;peculations of the planter. The new acqui&s;itions of Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincents, and Dominica, have opened a new field for &s;peculations of this kind; and the returns from tho&s;e i&s;lands have of late been as irregular and uncertain as tho&s;e from the great i&s;land of Jamaica.</P>
<P>IT is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occa&s;ions, in the greater part of them, the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver
<PB N="582" REF="584">
money. Their great demand for active and productive &s;tock makes it convenient for them to have as little dead &s;tock as po&s;&s;ible; and di&s;po&s;es them upon that account to content them|&s;elves with a cheaper, though le&s;s commodious in&s;trument of com|merce than gold and &s;ilver. They are thereby enabled to con|vert the value of that gold and &s;ilver into the in&s;truments of trade, into the materials of cloathing, into hou&s;hold furniture, and into the iron work nece&s;&s;ary for building and extending their &s;ettle|ments and plantations. In tho&s;e branches of bu&s;ine&s;s which can|not be tran&s;acted without gold and &s;ilver money, it appears that they can always find the nece&s;&s;ary quantity of tho&s;e metals; and if they frequently do not find it, their failure is generally the effect, not of their nece&s;&s;ary poverty, but of their unnece&s;&s;ary and exce&s;|&s;ive enterprize. It is not becau&s;e they are poor that their payments are irregular and uncertain; but becau&s;e they are too eager to become exce&s;&s;ively rich. Though all that part of the produce of the colony taxes, which was over and above what was nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expence of their own civil and military e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, were to be remitted to Great Britain in gold and &s;ilver, the colonies have abundantly wherewithal to purcha&s;e the requi&s;ite quantity of tho&s;e metals. They would in this ca&s;e be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their &s;urplus produce, with which they now purcha&s;e active and productive &s;tock, for dead &s;tock. In tran&s;acting their dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s they would be obliged to employ a co&s;tly in&s;tead of a cheap in&s;trument of commerce; and the ex|pence of purcha&s;ing this co&s;tly in&s;trument might damp &s;omewhat the vivacity and ardour of their exce&s;&s;ive enterprize in the improve|ment of land. It might not, however, be nece&s;&s;ary to remit any part of the American revenue in gold and &s;ilver. It might be remit|ted in bills drawn upon and accepted by particular merchants or companies in Great Britain, to whom a part of the &s;urplus produce of America had been con&s;igned, who would pay into the trea&s;ury the American revenue in money, after having them&s;elves received
<PB N="583" REF="585">
the value of it in goods; and the whole bu&s;ine&s;s might frequently be tran&s;acted without exporting a &s;ingle ounce of gold and &s;ilver from America.</P>
<P>IT is not contrary to ju&s;tice that both Ireland and America &s;hould contribute towards the di&s;charge of the public debt of Great Britain. That debt has been contracted in &s;upport of the government e&s;tabli&s;hed by the revolution, a government to which the prote&s;tants of Ireland owe, not only the whole authority which they at pre&s;ent enjoy in their own country, but every &s;ecu|rity which they po&s;&s;e&s;s for their liberty, their property, and their religion; a government to which &s;everal of the colonies of America owe their pre&s;ent charters, and con&s;equently their pre&s;ent con&s;ti|tution, and to which all the colonies of America owe the liberty, &s;ecurity, and property, which they have ever &s;ince enjoyed. That public debt has been contracted in the defence, not of Great Bri|tain alone, but of all the different provinces of the empire; the immen&s;e debt contracted in the late war in particular, and a great part of that contracted in the war before, were both properly con|tracted in defence of America.</P>
<P>BY a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, be&s;ides the freedom of trade, other advantages much more important, and which would much more than compen&s;ate any increa&s;e of taxes that might accompany that union. By the union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in Scotland gained a com|plete deliverance from the power of an ari&s;tocracy which had al|ways before oppre&s;&s;ed them. By a union with Great Britain the greater part of the people of all ranks in Ireland would gain an equally complete deliverance from a much more oppre&s;&s;ive ari&s;to|cracy; an ari&s;tocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and re&s;pectable di&s;tinctions of birth and fortune; but in

the mo&s;t odious of all di&s;tinctions, tho&s;e of religious and political prejudices; di&s;tinctions which more than any other animate both the in&s;olence of the oppre&s;&s;ors and the hatred and indignation of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and which commonly render the inhabitants of the &s;ame country more ho&s;tile to one another than tho&s;e of different coun|tries ever are. Without a union with Great Britain, the inhabi|tants of Ireland are not likely for many ages to con&s;ider them&s;elves as one people.</P>
<P>NO oppre&s;&s;ive ari&s;tocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies. Even they, however, would, in point of happine&s;s and tranquillity, gain con&s;iderably by a union with Great Britain. It would, at lea&s;t, deliver them from tho&s;e rancorous and virulent factions which are in&s;eparable from &s;mall democracies, and which have &s;o frequently divided the affections of their people, and di&s;turbed the tranquillity of their governments, in their form &s;o nearly democra|tical. In the ca&s;e of a total &s;eparation from Great Britain, which, unle&s;s prevented by a union of this kind, &s;eems very likely to take place, tho&s;e factions would be ten times more virulent than ever. Before the commencement of the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances, the coercive power of the mother country had always been able to re&s;train tho&s;e factions from breaking out into any thing wor&s;e than gro&s;s bru|tality and in&s;ult. If that coercive power was entirely taken away, they would probably &s;oon break out into open violence and blood|&s;hed. In all great countries which are united under one uniform government, the &s;pirit of party commonly prevails le&s;s in the remote provinces, than in the center of the empire. The di&s;tance of tho&s;e provinces from the capital, from the principal &s;eat of the great &s;cramble of faction and ambition, makes them enter le&s;s into the views of any of the contending parties, and renders them more indifferent and impartial &s;pectators of the conduct of all. The &s;pirit of party prevails le&s;s in Scotland than in England.
<PB N="585" REF="587">
In the ca&s;e of a union it would probably prevail le&s;s in Ireland than in Scotland, and the colonies would probably &s;oon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity at pre&s;ent unknown in any part of the Briti&s;h empire. Both Ireland and the colonies, indeed, would be &s;ubjected to heavier taxes than any which they at pre&s;ent pay. In con&s;equence, however, of a diligent and faithful appli|cation of the public revenue towards the di&s;charge of the national debt, the greater part of tho&s;e taxes might not be of long conti|nuance, and the public revenue of Great Britain might &s;oon be reduced to what was nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining a moderate peace e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE territorial acqui&s;itions of the Ea&s;t India company, the un|doubted right of the crown, that is, of the &s;tate and people of Great Britain, might be rendered another &s;ource of revenue more abundant perhaps than all tho&s;e already mentioned. Tho&s;e coun|tries are repre&s;ented as more fertile, more exten&s;ive; and in pro|portion to their extent much richer and more populous than Great Britain. In order to draw a great revenue from them, it would not probably be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce any new &s;y&s;tem of taxation into countries which are already &s;ufficiently and more than &s;uffi|ciently taxed. It might perhaps be more proper to lighten than to aggravate the burden of tho&s;e unfortunate countries, and to en|deavour to draw a revenue from them, not by impo&s;ing new taxes, but by preventing the embezzlement and mi&s;application of the greater part of tho&s;e which they already pay.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any con&s;iderable augmentation of revenue from any of the re|&s;ources above-mentioned; the only re&s;ource which can remain to her is a diminution of her expence. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public revenue; though in both
<PB N="586" REF="588">
there may be &s;till room for improvement; Great Britain &s;eems to be at lea&s;t as oeconomical as any of her neighbours. The mi|litary e&s;tabli&s;hment which &s;he maintains for her own defence in time of peace, is more moderate than that of any European &s;tate which can pretend to rival her either in wealth or in power. None of tho&s;e articles, therefore, &s;eem to admit of any con&s;ider|able reduction of expence. The expence of the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the colonies was, before the commencement of the pre|&s;ent di&s;turbances, very con&s;iderable, and is an expence which may, and if no revenue can be drawn from them, ought cer|tainly to be &s;aved altogether. This con&s;tant expence in time of peace, though very great, is in&s;ignificant in compari&s;on with what the defence of the colonies has co&s;t us in time of war. The la&s;t war, which was undertaken altogether on account of the colonies, co&s;t Great Britain, it has already been ob&s;erved, upwards of ninety millions. The Spani&s;h war of 1739 was prin|cipally undertaken on their account; in which, and in the French war that was the con&s;equence of it, Great Britain &s;pent up|wards of forty millions, a great part of which ought ju&s;tly to be charged to the colonies. In tho&s;e two wars the colonies co&s;t Great Britain much more than double the &s;um which the na|tional debt amounted to before the commencement of the fir&s;t of them. Had it not been for tho&s;e wars that debt might, and probably would by this time have been compleatly paid; and had it not been for the colonies, the former of tho&s;e wars might not, and the latter certainly would not have been undertaken. It was becau&s;e the colonies were &s;uppo&s;ed to be provinces of the Briti&s;h empire, that this expence was laid out upon them. But countries which contribute neither revenue nor military force to|wards the &s;upport of the empire, cannot be con&s;idered as pro|vinces. They may perhaps be con&s;idered as appendages, as a &s;ort of &s;plendid and &s;howy equipage of the empire. But if the
<PB N="587" REF="589">
empire can no longer &s;upport the expence of keeping up this equi|page, it ought certainly to lay it down; and if it cannot rai&s;e its revenue in proportion to its expence, it ought, at lea&s;t, to accommodate its expence to its revenue. If the colonies, not|with&s;tanding their refu&s;al to &s;ubmit to Briti&s;h taxes, are &s;till to be con&s;idered as provinces of the Briti&s;h empire, their defence in &s;ome future war may co&s;t Great Britain as great an expence as it ever has done in any former war. The rulers of Great Britain have for more than a century pa&s;t amu&s;ed the people with the imagination that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great empire on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto exi&s;ted in imagination only. It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has co&s;t, which continues to co&s;t, and which if pur&s;ued in the &s;ame way as it has been hitherto, is likely to co&s;t immen&s;e expence, without being likely to bring any profit; for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade, it has been &s;hewn, are, to the great body of the people, mere lo&s;s in&s;tead of profit. It is &s;urely now time that our rulers &s;hould either realize this golden dream, in which they have been indulg|ing them&s;elves, perhaps, as well as the people; or, that they &s;hould awake from it them&s;elves, and endeavour to awaken the people. If the project cannot be compleated, it ought to be given up. If any of the provinces of the Briti&s;h empire cannot be made to contribute towards the &s;upport of the whole empire, it is &s;urely time that Great Britain &s;hould free her&s;elf from the expence of defending tho&s;e provinces in time of war, and of &s;upporting any part of their civil or military e&s;tabli&s;hments in time of peace, and endeavour to accommodate her future views and de&s;igns to the real mediocrity of her circum&s;tances.</P>
