<P>THE Public has been &s;o much accu&s;tom'd of late to didactic Poetry alone, and E&s;&s;ays on moral Subjects, that any work where the imagination is much indulged, will perhaps not be reli&s;hed or regarded. The author therefore of the&s;e pieces is in &s;ome pain lea&s;t certain au&s;tere critics &s;hould think them too fanciful and de&s;criptive. But as he is convinced that the fa&s;hion of mora|lizing in ver&s;e has been carried too far, and as he looks upon Invention and Imagination to be the chief faculties of a Poet, &s;o he will be happy if the following Odes may be look'd upon as an attempt to bring back Poetry into its right channel.</P>
