I am hopeful it may be under&s;tood by or|dinary readers, with as little attention as is u&s;ually given to any books of rea&s;oning. It mu&s;t only be ob&s;erv'd, that I continue to make u&s;e of the terms,</HI> impre&s;&s;ions <HI>and</HI> ideas, <HI>in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as formerly; and that by</HI>

<P>_THERE is an inconvenience which attends all ab&s;tru&s;e rea|&s;oning, that it may &s;ilence, without convincing an antago|ni&s;t, and requires the &s;ame inten&s;e &s;tudy to
<PB N="2" REF="11">
make us &s;en&s;ible of its force, that was at fir&s;t requi&s;ite for its invention. When we leave our clo&s;et, and engage in the common affairs of life, its conclu&s;ions &s;eem to vani&s;h, like the phantoms of the night on the ap|pearance of the morning; and 'tis difficult for us to retain even that conviction, which we had attain'd with difficulty. This is &s;till more con&s;picuous in a long chain of rea&s;oning, where we mu&s;t pre&s;erve to the end the evidence of the fir&s;t propo&s;itions, and where we often lo&s;e &s;ight of all the mo&s;t receiv'd maxims, either of philo&s;ophy or common life. I am not, however, with|out hopes, that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of phi|lo&s;ophy will acquire new force as it ad|vances; and that our rea&s;onings concerning <HI>morals</HI> will corroborate whatever has been &s;aid concerning the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Morality is a &s;ubject that intere&s;ts us above all others: We fancy the peace of &s;ociety to be at &s;take in every deci&s;ion con|cerning it; and 'tis evident, that this concern mu&s;t make our &s;peculations appear more real and &s;olid, than where the &s;ubject is, in a great mea&s;ure, indifferent to us. What affects us, we conclude can never be a chi|mera; and as our pa&s;&s;ion is engag'd on the one &s;ide or the other, we naturally think
<PB N="3" REF="12">
that the que&s;tion lies within human compre|hen&s;ion; which, in other ca&s;es of this na|ture, we are apt to entertain &s;ome doubt of. Without this advantage I never &s;hould have ventur'd upon a third volume of &s;uch ab|&s;tru&s;e philo&s;ophy, in an age, wherein the greate&s;t part of men &s;eem agreed to convert reading into an amu&s;ement, and to reject every thing that requires any con&s;iderable degree of attention to be comprehended.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd, that nothing is ever pre&s;ent to the mind but its perceptions; and that all the actions of &s;eeing, hearing, judg|ing, loving, hating, and thinking, fall under this denomination. The mind can never exert it&s;elf in any action, which we may not comprehend under the term of <HI>perception;</HI> and con&s;equently that term is no le&s;s appli|cable to tho&s;e judgments, by which we di&s;tingui&s;h moral good and evil, than to every other operation of the mind. To ap|prove of one character, to condemn ano|ther, are only &s;o many different perceptions.</P>
<P>NOW as perceptions re&s;olve them&s;elves into two kinds, viz. <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>ideas,</HI> this di&s;tinction gives ri&s;e to a que&s;tion, with which we &s;hall open up our pre&s;ent enquiry concerning morals, <HI>Whether 'tis by means of</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="13">
<HI>our</HI> ideas <HI>or</HI> impre&s;&s;ions <HI>we di&s;tingui&s;h be|twixt vice and virtue, and pronounce an action blameable or prai&s;e-worthy?</HI> This will immediately cut off all loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;es and declamations, and reduce us to &s;omething preci&s;e and exact on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THOSE who affirm that virtue is nothing but a conformity to rea&s;on; that there are eternal fitne&s;&s;es and unfitne&s;&s;es of things, which are the &s;ame to every rational being that con&s;iders them; that the immutable mea&s;ures of right and wrong impo&s;e an ob|ligation, not only on human creatures, but al&s;o on the Deity him&s;elf: All the&s;e &s;y&s;tems concur in the opinion, that morality, like truth, is di&s;cern'd merely by ideas, and by their juxta-po&s;ition and compari&s;on. In or|der, therefore, to judge of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, we need only con&s;ider, whether it be po&s;&s;ible, from rea&s;on alone, to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt moral good and evil, or whether there mu&s;t concur &s;ome other principles to enable us to make that di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>IF morality had naturally no influence on human pa&s;&s;ions and actions, 'twere in vain to take &s;uch pains to inculcate it; and no|thing wou'd be more fruitle&s;s than that mul|titude of rules and precepts, with which all morali&s;ts abound. Philo&s;ophy is commonly
<PB N="5" REF="14">
divided into <HI>&s;peculative</HI> and <HI>practical;</HI> and as morality is always comprehended under the latter divi&s;ion, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed to influence our pa&s;&s;ions and actions, and to go beyond the calm and indolent judgments of the under|&s;tanding. And this is confirm'd by common experience, which informs us, that men are often govern'd by their duties, and are de|ter'd from &s;ome actions by the opinion of inju&s;tice, and impell'd to others by that of obligation.</P>
<P>SINCE morals, therefore, have an in|fluence on the actions and affections, it fol|lows, that they cannot be deriv'd from rea|&s;on; and that becau&s;e rea&s;on alone, as we have already prov'd, can never have any &s;uch influence. Morals excite pa&s;&s;ions, and pro|duce or prevent actions. Rea&s;on of it&s;elf is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not con|clu&s;ions of our rea&s;on.</P>
<P>NO one, I believe, will deny the ju&s;tne&s;s of this inference; nor is there any other means of evading it, than by denying that principle, on which it is founded. As long as it is allow'd, that rea&s;on has no influence on our pa&s;&s;ions and actions, 'tis in vain to pretend, that morality is di&s;cover'd only by a deduction of rea&s;on. An active principle
<PB N="6" REF="15">
can never be founded on an inactive; and if rea&s;on be inactive in it&s;elf, it mu&s;t remain &s;o in all its &s;hapes and appearances, whether it exerts it&s;elf in natural or moral &s;ubjects, whether it con&s;iders the powers of external bodies, or the actions of rational beings.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to repeat all the arguments, by which I have prov'd, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book II. Part III. Sect. 3.</NOTE> that rea&s;on is perfectly inert, and can never either prevent or produce any action or affection. 'Twill be ea&s;y to recollect what has been &s;aid upon that &s;ubject. I &s;hall only recal on this occa&s;ion one of the&s;e arguments, which I &s;hall endeavour to render &s;till more conclu&s;ive, and more applicable to the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>REASON is the di&s;covery of truth or fal&s;hood. Truth or fal&s;hood con&s;i&s;ts in an agreement or di&s;agreement either to the <HI>real</HI> relations of ideas, or to <HI>real</HI> exi&s;tence and matter of fact. Whatever, therefore, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of this argeement or di&s;agreement, is incapable of being true or fal&s;e, and can never be an object of our rea&s;on. Now 'tis evident our pa&s;&s;ions, volitions, and actions, are not &s;u&s;ceptible of any &s;uch agreement or di&s;agreement; being original facts and reali|ties, compleat in them&s;elves, and implying
<PB N="7" REF="16" MS="y">
no reference to other pa&s;&s;ions, volitions, and actions. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, they can be pronounced either true or fal&s;e, and be either contrary or conformable to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS argument is of double advantage to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. For it proves <HI>directly,</HI> that actions do not derive their merit from a conformity to rea&s;on, nor their blame from a contrariety to it; and it proves the &s;ame truth more <HI>indirectly,</HI> by &s;hewing us, that as rea&s;on can never immediately prevent or produce any action by contradicting or ap|proving of it, it cannot be the &s;ource of moral good and evil, which are found to have that influence. Actions may be lauda|ble or blameable; but they cannot be rea&s;on|able or unrea&s;onable: Laudable or blameable, therefore, are not the &s;ame with rea&s;onable or unrea&s;onable. The merit and demerit of actions frequently contradict, and &s;ometimes controul our natural propen&s;ities. But rea|&s;on has no &s;uch influence. Moral di&s;tinctions, therefore, are not the offspring of rea&s;on. Rea&s;on is wholly inactive, and can never be the &s;ource of &s;o active a principle as con|&s;cience, or a &s;en&s;e of morals.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it may be &s;aid, that tho' no will or action can be immediately contra|dictory to rea&s;on, yet we may find &s;uch a
<PB N="8" REF="17">
contradiction in &s;ome of the attendants of the action, that is, in its cau&s;es or effects. The action may cau&s;e a judgment, or may be <HI>obliquely</HI> caus'd by one, when the judg|ment concurs with a pa&s;&s;ion; and by an abu&s;ive way of &s;peaking, which philo&s;ophy will &s;carce allow of, the &s;ame contrariety may, upon that account, be a&s;crib'd to the action. How far this truth or fal&s;hood may be the &s;ource of morals, 'twill now be pro|per to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd, that rea&s;on, in a &s;trict and philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e, can have an influence on our conduct only after two ways: Either when it excites a pa&s;&s;ion by informing us of the exi&s;tence of &s;omething which is a proper object of it; or when it di&s;covers the connexion of cau&s;es and effects, &s;o as to afford us means of exerting any pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are the only kinds of judg|ment, which can accompany our actions, or can be &s;aid to produce them in any manner; and it mu&s;t be allow'd, that the&s;e judgments may often be fal&s;e and erroneous. A per&s;on may be affected with pa&s;&s;ion, by &s;uppo&s;ing a pain or plea&s;ure to lie in an object, which has no tendency to produce either of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, or which produces the contrary to what is imagin'd. A per&s;on may al&s;o
<PB N="9" REF="18">
take fal&s;e mea&s;ures for the attaining his end, and may retard, by his fooli&s;h conduct, in|&s;tead of forwarding the execution of any project. The&s;e fal&s;e judgments may be thought to affect the pa&s;&s;ions and actions, which are connected with them, and may be &s;aid to render them unrea&s;onable, in a figurative and improper way of &s;peaking. But tho' this be acknowledg'd, 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e errors are &s;o far from be|ing the &s;ource of all immorality, that they are commonly very innocent, and draw no manner of guilt upon the per&s;on who is &s;o unfortunate as to fall into them. They ex|tend not beyond a mi&s;take of <HI>fact,</HI> which morali&s;ts have not generally &s;uppos'd crimi|nal, as being perfectly involuntary. I am more to be lamented than blam'd, if I am mi&s;taken with regard to the influence of ob|jects in producing pain or plea&s;ure, or if I know not the proper means of &s;atisfying my de&s;ires. No one can ever regard &s;uch errors as a defect in my moral character. A fruit, for in&s;tance, that is really di&s;agreeable, ap|pears to me at a di&s;tance, and thro' mi&s;take I fancy it to be plea&s;ant and delicious. Here is one error. I choo&s;e certain means of reaching this fruit, which are not proper for my end. Here is a &s;econd error; nor is there
<PB N="10" REF="19">
any third one, which can ever po&s;&s;ibly enter into our rea&s;onings concerning actions. I ask, therefore, if a man, in this &s;ituation, and guilty of the&s;e two errors, is to be re|garded as vicious and criminal, however un|avoidable they might have been? Or if it be po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that &s;uch errors are the &s;ources of all immorality?</P>
<P>AND here it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that if moral di&s;tinctions be deriv'd from the truth or fal&s;hood of tho&s;e judgments, they mu&s;t take place wherever we form the judg|ments; nor will there be any difference, whe|ther the que&s;tion be concerning an apple or a kingdom, or whether the error be avoid|able or unavoidable. For as the very e&s;|&s;ence of morality is &s;uppos'd to con&s;i&s;t in an agreement or di&s;agreement to rea&s;on, the other circum&s;tances are entirely arbitrary, and can never either be&s;tow on any action the character of virtuous or vicious, or deprive it of that character. To which we may add, that this agreement or di&s;agreement, not ad|mitting of degrees, all virtues and vices wou'd of cour&s;e be equal.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it be pretended, that tho' a mi|&s;take of <HI>fact</HI> be not criminal, yet a mi&s;take of <HI>right</HI> often is; and that this may be the &s;ource of immorality: I would an&s;wer, that
<PB N="11" REF="20">
'tis impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a mi&s;take can ever be the original &s;ource of immorality, &s;ince it &s;uppo&s;es a real right and wrong; that is, a real di|&s;tinction in morals, independent of the&s;e judgments. A mi&s;take, therefore, of right may become a &s;pecies of immorality; but 'tis only a &s;econdary one, and is founded on &s;ome other, antecedent to it.</P>
<P>AS to tho&s;e judgments which are the <HI>ef|fects</HI> of our actions, and which, when fal&s;e, give occa&s;ion to pronounce the actions con|trary to truth and rea&s;on; we may ob&s;erve, that our actions never cau&s;e any judgment, either true or fal&s;e, in our&s;elves, and that 'tis only on others they have &s;uch an influence. 'Tis certain, that an action, on many occa|&s;ions, may give ri&s;e to fal&s;e conclu&s;ions in others; and that a per&s;on, who thro' a win|dow &s;ees any lewd behaviour of mine with my neighbour's wife, may be &s;o &s;imple as to imagine &s;he is certainly my own. In this re|&s;pect my action re&s;embles &s;omewhat a lye or fal&s;hood; only with this difference, which is material, that I perform not the action with any intention of giving ri&s;e to a fal&s;e judg|ment in another, but merely to &s;atisfy my lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion. It cau&s;es, however, a mi|&s;take and fal&s;e judgment by accident; and the fal&s;hood of its effects may be a&s;cribed,
<PB N="12" REF="21">
by &s;ome odd figurative way of &s;peaking, to the action it&s;elf. But &s;till I can &s;ee no pre|text of rea&s;on for a&s;&s;erting, that the tenden|cy to cau&s;e &s;uch an error is the fir&s;t &s;pring or original &s;ource of all immorality <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>One might think it were entirely &s;uperfluous to prove this, if a late author, who has had the good fortune to ob|tain &s;ome reputation, had not &s;eriou&s;ly affirmed, that &s;uch a fal&s;hood is the foundation of all guilt and moral deformity. That we may di&s;cover the fallacy of his hypothe&s;is, we need only con&s;ider, that a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion is drawn from an action, only by means of an ob&s;curity of natural principles, which makes a cau&s;e be &s;ecretly interrupted in its operation, by con|trary cau&s;es, and renders the connection betwixt two objects uncertain and variable. Now, as a like uncertainty and va|riety of cau&s;es take place, even in natural objects, and pro|duce a like error in our judgment, if that tendency to produce error were the very e&s;&s;ence of vice and immorality, it &s;hou'd follow, that even inanimate objects might be vicious and im|moral.</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to urge, that inanimate objects act without li|berty and choice. For as liberty and choice are not nece&s;&s;ary to make an action produce in us an erroneous conclu&s;ion, they can be, in no re&s;pect, e&s;&s;ential to morality; and I do not readily perceive, upon this &s;y&s;tem, how they can ever come to be regarded by it. If the tendency to cau&s;e error be the origin of immorality, that tendency and immorality wou'd in every ca&s;e be in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if I had u&s;ed the precaution of &s;hutting the windows, while I indulg'd my&s;elf in tho&s;e liberties with my neighbour's wife, I &s;hould have been guilty of no immo|rality; and that becau&s;e my action, being perfectly conceal'd, wou'd have had no tendency to produce any fal&s;e conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a thief, who &s;teals in by a ladder at a window, and takes all imaginable care to cau&s;e no di&s;turbance, is in no re&s;pect criminal. For either he will not be perceiv'd, or if he be, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he can produce any error, nor will any one, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, take him to be other than what he really is.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that tho&s;e who are &s;quint-&s;ighted, do very readily cau&s;e mi&s;takes in others, and that we imagine they &s;a|lute or are talking to one per&s;on, while they addre&s;s them&s;elves to another. Are they therefore, upon that account, immoral?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that in all tho&s;e arguments there is an evident rea&s;oning in a circle. A per&s;on who takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>another</HI>'s goods, and u&s;es them as his <HI>own,</HI> in a manner declares them to be his own; and this fal&s;hood is the &s;ource of the immorality of inju&s;tice. But is property, or right, or obligation, intelligible, without an antecedent mora|lity?</P>
<P>A man that is ungrateful to his benefactor, in a manner af|firms, that he never received any favours from him. But in what manner? Is it becau&s;e 'tis his duty to be grateful? But this &s;uppo&s;es, that there is &s;ome antecedent rule of duty and morals. Is it becau&s;e human nature is generally grateful, and makes us conclude, that a man who does any harm never re|ceived any favour from the per&s;on he harm'd? But human na|ture is not &s;o generally grateful, as to ju&s;tify &s;uch a conclu&s;ion. Or if it were, is an exception to a general rule in every ca&s;e criminal, for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e it is an exception?</P>
<P>But what may &s;uffice entirely to de&s;troy this whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tem is, that it leaves us under the &s;ame difficulty to give a rea&s;on why truth is virtuous and fal&s;hood vicious, as to account for the merit or turpitude of any other action. I &s;hall allow, if you plea&s;e, that all immorality is derived from this &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;e|hood in action, provided you can give me any plau&s;ible rea|&s;on, why &s;uch a fal&s;hood is immoral. If you con&s;ider rightly of the matter, you will find your&s;elf in the &s;ame difficulty as at the beginning.</P>
<P>This la&s;t argument is very conclu&s;ive; becau&s;e, if there be not an evident merit or turpitude annex'd to this &s;pecies of truth or fal&s;hood, it can never have any influence upon our actions. For, who ever thought of forbearing any action, be|cau&s;e others might po&s;&s;ibly draw fal&s;e conclu&s;ions from it? Or, who ever perform'd any, that he might give ri&s;e to true con|clu&s;ions?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS upon the whole, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, that the di&s;tinction betwixt moral good and evil,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
can be made by rea&s;on; &s;ince that di&s;tinction has an influence upon our actions, of which rea&s;on alone is incapable. Rea&s;on and judg|ment may, indeed, be the mediate cau&s;e of an action, by prompting, or by directing a
<PB N="14" REF="23">
pa&s;&s;ion: But it is not pretended, that a judg|ment of this kind, either in its truth or fal&s;hood, is attended with virtue or vice. And as to the judgments, which are cau&s;ed by our judgments, they can &s;till le&s;s be&s;tow tho&s;e moral qualities on the actions, which are their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT to be more particular, and to &s;hew, that tho&s;e eternal immutable fitne&s;&s;es and unfitne&s;&s;es of things cannot be defended by &s;ound philo&s;ophy, we may weigh the fol|lowing con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>IF the thought and under&s;tanding were alone capable of fixing the boundaries of right and wrong, the character of virtuous and vicious either mu&s;t lie in &s;ome relations of objects, or mu&s;t be a matter of fact, which is di&s;covered by our rea&s;oning. This con&s;equence is evident. As the operations of human under&s;tanding divide them&s;elves into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of fact; were virtue di&s;cover'd by the under&s;tanding; it mu&s;t be an object of one of the&s;e operations, nor is there any third operation of the under&s;tand|ing, which can di&s;cover it. There has been an opinion very indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by certain philo&s;ophers, that morality is &s;u&s;cep|tible of demon&s;tration; and tho' no one has
<PB N="15" REF="24">
ever been able to advance a &s;ingle &s;tep in tho&s;e demon&s;trations; yet 'tis taken for gran|ted, that this &s;cience may be brought to an equal certainty with geometry or algebra. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, vice and virtue mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome relations; &s;ince 'tis allow'd on all hands, that no matter of fact is capa|ble of being demon&s;trated. Let us, therefore, begin with examining this hypothe&s;is, and endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to fix tho&s;e moral qualities, which have been &s;o long the ob|jects of our fruitle&s;s re&s;earches. Point out di&s;tinctly the relations, which con&s;titute morality or obligation, that we may know wherein they con&s;i&s;t, and after what man|ner we mu&s;t judge of them.</P>
<P>IF you a&s;&s;ert, that vice and virtue con&s;i&s;t in relations &s;u&s;ceptible of certainty and de|mon&s;tration, you mu&s;t confine your&s;elf to tho&s;e <HI>four</HI> relations, which alone admit of that degree of evidence; and in that ca&s;e you run into ab&s;urdities, from which you will never be able to extricate your&s;elf. For as you make the very e&s;&s;ence of morality to lie in the relations, and as there is no one of the&s;e relations but what is applicable, not only to an irrational, but al&s;o to an inanimate object; it follows, that even &s;uch objects mu&s;t be &s;u&s;ceptible of merit or demerit.
<PB N="16" REF="25">
<HI>Re&s;emblance, contrariety, degrees in quality,</HI> and <HI>proportions in quantity and number;</HI> all the&s;e relations belong as properly to matter, as to our actions, pa&s;&s;ions, and volitions. 'Tis unque&s;tionable, therefore, that morality lies not in any of the&s;e relations, nor the &s;en&s;e of it in their di&s;covery <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">As a proof, how confus'd our way of thinking on this &s;ubject commonly is, we may ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert, that morality is demon&s;trable, do not &s;ay, that morality lies in the relations, and that the relations are di&s;tingui&s;hable by rea&s;on. They only &s;ay, that rea&s;on can di&s;cover &s;uch an ac|tion, in &s;uch relations, to be virtuous, and &s;uch another vi|cious. It &s;eems they thought it &s;ufficient, if they cou'd bring the word, Relation, into the propo&s;ition, without troubling them&s;elves whether it was to the purpo&s;e or not. But here, I think, is plain argument. Demon&s;trative rea&s;on di&s;covers only relations. But that rea&s;on, according to this hypothe|&s;is, di&s;covers al&s;o vice and virtue. The&s;e moral qualities, therefore, mu&s;t be relations. When we blame any action, in any &s;ituation, the whole complicated object, of action and &s;i|tuation, mu&s;t form certain relations, wherein the e&s;&s;ence of vice con&s;i&s;ts. This hypothe&s;is is not otherwi&s;e intelligible. For what does rea&s;on di&s;cover, when it pronounces any action vicious? Does it di&s;cover a relation or a matter of fact? The&s;e que&s;tions are deci&s;ive, and mu&s;t not be eluded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it be a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;en&s;e of morality con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;covery of &s;ome relation, di&s;tinct from the&s;e, and that our enumeration was not compleat, when we comprehended all demon&s;trable relations un|der four general heads: To this I know not what to reply, till &s;ome one be &s;o good as to point out to me this new relation. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to refute a &s;y&s;tem, which has ne|ver
<PB N="17" REF="26">
yet been explain'd. In &s;uch a manner of fighting in the dark, a man lo&s;es his blows in the air, and often places them where the enemy is not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I MUST, therefore, on this occa&s;ion, re&s;t contented with requiring the two following conditions of any one that wou'd undertake to clear up this &s;y&s;tem. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As moral good and evil belong only to the actions of the mind, and are deriv'd from our &s;ituation with regard to external objects, the rela|tions, from which the&s;e moral di&s;tinctions ari&s;e, mu&s;t lie only betwixt internal actions, and external objects, and mu&s;t not be appli|cable either to internal actions, compared among them&s;elves, or to external objects, when placed in oppo&s;ition to other external objects. For as morality is &s;uppo&s;ed to at|tend certain relations, if the&s;e relations cou'd belong to internal actions con&s;ider'd &s;ingly, it wou'd follow, that we might be guilty of crimes in our&s;elves, and independent of our &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to the univer&s;e: And in like manner, if the&s;e moral relations cou'd be apply'd to external objects, it wou'd follow, that even inanimate beings wou'd be &s;u&s;ceptible of moral beauty and deformity. Now it &s;eems difficult to imagine, that any relation can be di&s;cover'd betwixt our pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="18" REF="27">
volitions and actions, compared to ex|ternal objects, which relation might not be|long either to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and volitions, or to the&s;e external objects, compar'd among <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it will be &s;till more difficult to ful|fil the <HI>&s;econd</HI> condition, requi&s;ite to ju&s;tify this &s;y&s;tem. According to the principles of tho&s;e who maintain an ab&s;tract rational dif|ference betwixt moral good and evil, and a natural fitne&s;s and unfitne&s;s of things, 'tis not only &s;uppos'd, that the&s;e relations, being eternal and immutable, are the &s;ame, when con&s;ider'd by every rational creature, but their <HI>effects</HI> are al&s;o &s;uppos'd to be nece&s;&s;arily the &s;ame; and 'tis concluded they have no le&s;s, or rather a greater, influence in direct|ing the will of the deity, than in governing the rational and virtuous of our own &s;pe|cies. The&s;e two particulars are evidently di&s;tinct. 'Tis one thing to know virtue, and another to conform the will to it. In order, therefore, to prove, that the mea&s;ures of right and wrong are eternal laws, <HI>obligatory</HI> on every rational mind, 'tis not &s;ufficient to &s;hew the relations upon which they are founded: We mu&s;t al&s;o point out the con|nexion betwixt the relation and the will; and mu&s;t prove that this connexion is &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="28">
nece&s;&s;ary, that in every well-di&s;po&s;ed mind, it mu&s;t take place and have its influence; tho' the difference betwixt the&s;e minds be in other re&s;pects immen&s;e and infinite. Now be&s;ides what I have already prov'd, that even in human nature no relation can ever alone produce any action; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, it has been &s;hewn, in treating of the under|&s;tanding, that there is no connexion of cau&s;e and effect, &s;uch as this is &s;uppos'd to be, which is di&s;coverable otherwi&s;e than by experience, and of which we can pretend to have any &s;ecurity by the &s;imple con&s;ideration of the objects. All beings in the univer&s;e, con&s;ider'd in them&s;elves, appear entirely loo&s;e and independent of each other. 'Tis only by experience we learn their influence and connexion; and this influence we ought never to extend beyond experience.</P>
<P>THUS it will be impo&s;&s;ible to fulfil the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> condition required to the &s;y&s;tem of eter|nal rational mea&s;ures of right and wrong; becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew tho&s;e rela|tions, upon which &s;uch a di&s;tinction may be founded: And 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible to fulfil the <HI>&s;econd</HI> condition; becau&s;e we cannot prove <HI>a priori,</HI> that the&s;e relations, if they really exi&s;ted and were perceiv'd, wou'd be univer&s;ally forcible and obligatory.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
BUT to make the&s;e general reflections more clear and convincing, we may illu|&s;trate them by &s;ome particular in&s;tances, wherein this character of moral good or evil is the mo&s;t univer&s;ally acknowledged. Of all crimes that human creatures are ca|pable of committing, the mo&s;t horrid and unnatural is ingratitude, e&s;pecially when it is committed again&s;t parents, and appears in the more flagrant in&s;tances of wounds and death. This is acknowledg'd by all man|kind, philo&s;ophers as well as the people; the que&s;tion only ari&s;es among philo&s;ophers, whether the guilt or moral deformity of this action be di&s;cover'd by demon&s;trative rea&s;on|ing, or be felt by an internal &s;en&s;e, and by means of &s;ome &s;entiment, which the reflect|ing on &s;uch an action naturally occa&s;ions. This que&s;tion will &s;oon be decided again&s;t the former opinion, if we can &s;hew the &s;ame relations in other objects, without the notion of any guilt or iniquity attending them. Rea&s;on or &s;cience is nothing but the com|paring of ideas, and the di&s;covery of their relations; and if the &s;ame relations have different characters, it mu&s;t evidently follow, that tho&s;e characters are not di&s;cover'd merely by rea&s;on. To put the affair, therefore, to this trial, let us chu&s;e any inanimate object,
<PB N="21" REF="30">
&s;uch as an oak or elm; and let us &s;uppo&s;e, that by the dropping of its &s;eed, it produces a &s;apling below it, which &s;pringing up by degrees, at la&s;t overtops and de&s;troys the parent tree: I a&s;k, if in this in&s;tance there be wanting any relation, which is di&s;cover|able in parricide or ingratitude? Is not the one tree the cau&s;e of the other's exi&s;tence; and the latter the cau&s;e of the de&s;truction of the former, in the &s;ame manner as when a child murders his parent? 'Tis not &s;uffi|cient to reply, that a choice or will is want|ing. For in the ca&s;e of parricide, a will does not give ri&s;e to any <HI>different</HI> relations, but is only the cau&s;e from which the action is deriv'd; and con&s;equently produces the <HI>&s;ame</HI> relations, that in the oak or elm ari&s;e from &s;ome other principles. 'Tis a will or choice, that determines a man to kill his parent; and they are the laws of matter and motion, that determine a &s;apling to de&s;troy the oak, from which it &s;prung. Here then the &s;ame relations have different cau&s;es; but &s;till the relations are the &s;ame: And as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> di&s;covery is not in both ca&s;es attended with a notion of immorality, it follows, that that notion does not ari&s;e from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a di&s;|covery.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">
BUT to chu&s;e an in&s;tance, &s;till more re|&s;embling; I would fain a&s;k any one, why ince&s;t in the human &s;pecies is criminal, and why the very &s;ame action, and the &s;ame relations in animals have not the &s;malle&s;t moral turpitude and deformity? If it be an&s;wer'd, that this action is innocent in ani|mals, becau&s;e they have not rea&s;on &s;ufficient to di&s;cover its turpitude; but that man, be|ing endow'd with that faculty, which <HI>ought</HI> to re&s;train him to his duty, the &s;ame action in&s;tantly becomes criminal to him; &s;hould this be &s;aid, I would reply, that this is evi|dently arguing in a circle. For before rea|&s;on can perceive this turpitude, the turpitude mu&s;t exi&s;t; and con&s;equently is independent of the deci&s;ions of our rea&s;on, and is their object more properly than their effect. Ac|cording to this &s;y&s;tem, then, every animal, that has &s;en&s;e, and appetite, and will; that is, every animal mu&s;t be &s;u&s;ceptible of all the &s;ame virtues and vices, for which we a&s;cribe prai&s;e and blame to human creatures. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the difference is, that our &s;uperior rea&s;on may &s;erve to di&s;cover the vice or virtue, and by that means may augment the blame or prai&s;e: But &s;till this di&s;covery &s;uppo&s;es a &s;eparate being in the&s;e moral di&s;tinctions, and a being, which depends only on the
<PB N="23" REF="32">
will and appetite, and which, both in thought and reality, may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the rea&s;on. Animals are &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame relations, with re&s;pect to each other, as the human &s;pecies, and therefore wou'd al&s;o be &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame morality, if the e&s;&s;ence of morality con&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e rela|tions. Their want of a &s;ufficient degree of rea&s;on may hinder them from perceiving the duties and obligations of morality, but can never hinder the&s;e duties from exi&s;ting; &s;ince they mu&s;t antecedently exi&s;t, in order to their being perceiv'd. Rea&s;on mu&s;t find them, and can never produce them. This argument de&s;erves to be weigh'd, as being, in my opinion, entirely deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>NOR does this rea&s;oning only prove, that morality con&s;i&s;ts not in any relations, that are the objects of &s;cience; but if examin'd, will prove with equal certainty, that it con&s;i&s;ts not in any <HI>matter of fact,</HI> which can be di&s;cover'd by the under&s;tanding. This is the <HI>&s;econd</HI> part of our argument; and if it can be made evident, we may conclude, that morality is not an object of rea&s;on. But can there be any difficulty in proving, that vice and virtue are not matters of fact, who&s;e exi&s;tence we can infer by rea&s;on? Take any action allow'd to be vicious: Wil|ful
<PB N="24" REF="33">
murder, for in&s;tance. Examine it in all lights, and &s;ee if you can find that matter of fact, or real exi&s;tence, which you call <HI>vice.</HI> In which-ever way you take it, you find only certain pa&s;&s;ions, motives, volitions and thoughts. There is no other matter of fact in the ca&s;e. The vice entirely e&s;capes you, as long as you con&s;ider the object. You never can find it, till you turn your reflection into your own brea&s;t, and find a &s;entiment of di&s;approbation, which ari&s;es in you, towards this action. Here is a matter of fact; but 'tis the object of feeling, not of rea&s;on. It lies in your&s;elf, not in the object. So that when you pronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but that from the con&s;titution of your na|ture you have a feeling or &s;entiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compar'd to &s;ounds, colours, heat and cold, which, ac|cording to modern philo&s;ophy, are not qua|lities in objects, but perceptions in the mind: And this di&s;covery in morals, like that other in phy&s;ics, is to be regarded as a con|&s;iderable advancement of the &s;peculative &s;ciences; tho', like that too, it has little or no influence on practice. Nothing can be more real, or concern us more, than our
<PB N="25" REF="34">
own &s;entiments of plea&s;ure and unea&s;ine&s;s; and if the&s;e be favourable to virtue, and un|favourable to vice, no more can be requi&s;ite to the regulation of our conduct and be|haviour.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear adding to the&s;e rea&s;onings an ob&s;ervation, which may, perhaps, be found of &s;ome importance. In every &s;y&s;tem of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the author proceeds for &s;ome time in the ordinary way of rea&s;oning, and e&s;tabli&s;hes the being of a God, or makes ob&s;ervations concerning hu|man affairs; when of a &s;udden I am &s;ur|priz'd to find, that in&s;tead of the u&s;ual copulations of propo&s;itions, <HI>is,</HI> and <HI>is not,</HI> I meet with no propo&s;ition that is not con|nected with an <HI>ought,</HI> or an <HI>ought not.</HI> This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the la&s;t con&s;equence. For as this <HI>ought,</HI> or <HI>ought not,</HI> expre&s;&s;es &s;ome new relation or affirmation, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hou'd be ob&s;erv'd and explain'd; and at the &s;ame time that a rea&s;on &s;hould be given, for what &s;eems altogether inconceivable, how this new rela|tion can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly u&s;e this precaution, I &s;hall pre&s;ume to recommend it to the readers;
<PB N="26" REF="35">
and am per&s;uaded, that this &s;mall attention wou'd &s;ubvert all the vulgar &s;y&s;tems of morality, and let us &s;ee, that the di&s;tinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv'd by rea&s;on.</P>

<P>THUS the cour&s;e of the argument leads us to conclude, that &s;ince vice and virtue are not di&s;coverable merely by rea&s;on, or the compari&s;on of ideas, it mu&s;t be by means of &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion or &s;enti|ment they occa&s;ion, that we are able to mark the difference betwixt them. Our deci&s;ions concerning moral rectitude and de|pravity are evidently perceptions; and as all perceptions are either impre&s;&s;ions or ideas, the exclu&s;ion of the one is a convincing argument for the other. Morality, there|fore, is more properly felt than judg'd of; tho' this feeling or &s;entiment is commonly &s;o &s;oft and gentle, that we are apt to con|found it with an idea, according to our com|mon
<PB N="27" REF="36">
cu&s;tom of taking all things for the &s;ame, which have any near re&s;emblance to each other.</P>
<P>THE next que&s;tion is, Of what nature are the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and after what manner do they operate upon us? Here we cannot re|main long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but mu&s;t pronounce the impre&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from virtue, to be agreeable, and that proceding from vice to be unea&s;y. Every moment's experience mu&s;t convince us of this. There is no &s;pectacle &s;o fair and beautiful as a noble and generous action; nor any which gives us more abhor|rence than one that is cruel and treacherous. No enjoyment equals the &s;atisfaction we re|ceive from the company of tho&s;e we love and e&s;teem; as the greate&s;t of all puni&s;h|ments is to be oblig'd to pa&s;s our lives with tho&s;e we hate or contemn. A very play or romance may afford us in&s;tances of this plea|&s;ure, which virtue conveys to us; and pain, which ari&s;es from vice.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince the di&s;tingui&s;hing impre&s;&s;ions, by which moral good or evil is known, are nothing but <HI>particular</HI> pains or plea&s;ures; it follows, that in all enquiries concerning the&s;e moral di&s;tinctions, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the principles, which make us feel a &s;ati&s;|faction or unea&s;ine&s;s from the &s;urvey of any
<PB N="28" REF="37">
character, in order to &s;atisfy us why the cha|racter is laudable or blameable. An action, or &s;entiment, or character is virtuous or vicious; why? becau&s;e its view cau&s;es a plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s of a particular kind. In giving a rea&s;on, therefore, for the plea|&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s, we &s;ufficiently explain the vice or virtue. To have the &s;en&s;e of virtue, is nothing but to <HI>feel</HI> a &s;atisfaction of a par|ticular kind from the contemplation of a character. The very <HI>feeling</HI> con&s;titutes our prai&s;e or admiration. We go no farther; nor do we enquire into the cau&s;e of the &s;a|tisfaction. We do not infer a character to be virtuous, becau&s;e it plea&s;es: But in feeling that it plea&s;es after &s;uch a particular man|ner, we in effect feel that it is virtuous. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame as in our judgments con|cerning all kinds of beauty, and ta&s;tes, and &s;en&s;ations. Our approbation is imply'd in the immediate plea&s;ure they convey to us.</P>
<P>I HAVE objected to the &s;y&s;tem, which e&s;tabli&s;hes eternal rational mea&s;ures of right and wrong, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew, in the actions of rea&s;onable creatures, any rela|tions, which are not found in external ob|jects; and therefore, if morality always at|tended the&s;e relations, 'twere po&s;&s;ible for inanimate matter to become virtuous or vi|cious.
<PB N="29" REF="38">
Now it may, in like manner, be ob|jected to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, that if virtue and vice be determin'd by plea&s;ure and pain, the&s;e qualities mu&s;t, in every ca&s;e, ari&s;e from the &s;en&s;ations; and con&s;equently any object, whether animate or inanimate, rational or ir|rational, might become morally good or evil, provided it can excite a &s;atisfaction or un|ea&s;ine&s;s. But tho' this objection &s;eems to be the very &s;ame, it has by no means the &s;ame force, in the one ca&s;e as in the other. For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> 'tis evident, that under the term <HI>plea|&s;ure,</HI> we comprehend &s;en&s;ations, which are very different from each other, and which have only &s;uch a di&s;tant re&s;emblance, as is requi&s;ite to make them be expre&s;s'd by the &s;ame ab&s;tract term. A good compo&s;ition of mu&s;ic and a bottle of good wine equally produce plea&s;ure; and what is more, their goodne&s;s is determin'd merely by the plea|&s;ure. But &s;hall we &s;ay upon that account, that the wine is harmonious, or the mu&s;ic of a good flavour? In like manner an inani|mate object, and the character or &s;entiments of any per&s;on may, both of them, give &s;a|tisfaction; but as the &s;atisfaction is different, this keeps our &s;entiments concerning them from being confounded, and makes us a&s;cribe virtue to the one, and not to the other.
<PB N="30" REF="39">
Nor is every &s;entiment of plea&s;ure or pain, which ari&s;es from characters and actions, of that <HI>peculiar</HI> kind, which makes us prai&s;e or condemn.

'Tis only when a character is con&s;idered in general, without reference to our particular intere&s;t, that it cau&s;es &s;uch a feeling or &s;entiment, as deno|minates it morally good or evil. 'Tis true, tho&s;e &s;entiments, from intere&s;t and morals, are apt to be confounded, and naturally run in|to one another. It &s;eldom happens, that we do not think an enemy vicious, and can di&s;tin|gui&s;h betwixt his oppo&s;ition to our intere&s;t and real villainy or ba&s;ene&s;s. But this hinders not, but that the &s;entiments are, in them|&s;elves, di&s;tinct; and a man of temper and judgment may pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the&s;e illu&s;ions. In like manner, tho' 'tis certain a mu&s;ical voice is nothing but one that natu|rally gives a <HI>particular</HI> kind of plea&s;ure; yet 'tis difficult for a man to be &s;en&s;ible, that the voice of an enemy is agreeable, or to allow it to be mu&s;ical. But a per&s;on of a fine ear, who has the command of him&s;elf, can &s;e|parate the&s;e feelings, and give prai&s;e to what de&s;erves it.</P>

<HI>Secondly,</HI> We may call to remembrance the preceding &s;y&s;tem of the pa&s;&s;ions, in or|der to remark a &s;till more con&s;iderable dif|ference among our pains and plea&s;ures. Pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there is any thing pre&s;ented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the pa&s;|&s;ion, and produces a &s;eparate &s;en&s;ation rela|ted to the &s;en&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;ion. Now virtue and vice are attended with the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances. They mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be plac'd either in our&s;elves or others, and excite ei|ther plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s; and therefore mu&s;t give ri&s;e to one of the&s;e four pa&s;&s;ions; which clearly di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the plea&s;ure and pain ari&s;ing from inanimate ob|jects, that often bear no relation to us: And this is, perhaps, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable effect that virtue and vice have upon the human mind.</P>
<P>IT may now be ask'd <HI>in general,</HI> con|cerning this pain or plea&s;ure, that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes moral good and evil, <HI>From what principles is it derived, and whence does it ari&s;e in the human mind?</HI> To this I reply, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that 'tis ab&s;urd to imagine, that in every particular in&s;tance, the&s;e &s;entiments are produc'd by an <HI>original</HI> quality and <HI>pri|mary</HI> con&s;titution. For as the number of
<PB N="32" REF="41">
our duties is, in a manner, infinite, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that our original in&s;tincts &s;hould ex|tend to each of them, and from our very fir&s;t infancy impre&s;s on the human mind all that multitude of precepts, which are con|tain'd in the compleate&s;t &s;y&s;tem of ethics. Such a method of proceeding is not con|formable to the u&s;ual maxims, by which na|ture is conducted, where a few principles produce all that variety we ob&s;erve in the univer&s;e, and every thing is carry'd on in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple manner. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to abridge the&s;e primary impul&s;es, and find &s;ome more general prin|ciples, upon which all our notions of mo|rals are founded.</P>
<P>BUT in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, &s;hould it be ask'd, Whether we ought to &s;earch for the&s;e prin|ciples in <HI>nature,</HI> or whether we mu&s;t look for them in &s;ome other origin? I wou'd re|ply, that our an&s;wer to this que&s;tion depends upon the definition of the word, Nature, than which there is none more ambiguous and equivocal. If <HI>nature</HI> be oppos'd to mi|racles, not only the di&s;tinction betwixt vice and virtue is natural, but al&s;o every event, which has ever happen'd in the world, <HI>ex|cepting tho&s;e miracles, on which our religion is founded.</HI> In &s;aying, then, that the &s;enti|ments
<PB N="33" REF="42">
of vice and virtue are natural in this &s;en&s;e, we make no very extraordinary di&s;covery.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>nature</HI> may al&s;o be oppo&s;ed to rare and unu&s;ual; and in this &s;en&s;e of the word, which is the common one, there may often ari&s;e di&s;putes concerning what is natural or unnatural; and one may in general affirm, that we are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any very preci&s;e &s;tandard, by which the&s;e di&s;putes can be de|cided. Frequent and rare depend upon the number of examples we have ob&s;erv'd; and as this number may gradually encrea&s;e or dimini&s;h, 'twill be impo&s;&s;ible to fix any ex|act boundaries betwixt them. We may only affirm on this head, that if ever there was any thing, which cou'd be call'd natural in this &s;en&s;e, the &s;entiments of morality cer|tainly may; &s;ince there never was any nation of the world, nor any &s;ingle per&s;on in any nation, who was utterly depriv'd of them, and who never, in any in&s;tance, &s;hew'd the lea&s;t approbation or di&s;like of manners. The&s;e &s;entiments are &s;o rooted in our con|&s;titution and temper, that without entirely confounding the human mind by di&s;ea&s;e or madne&s;s, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to extirpate and de|&s;troy them.</P>

and in this &s;en&s;e it may be di&s;puted, whether the notions of virtue be natural or not. We readily forget, that the de&s;igns, and projects, and views of men are principles as nece&s;&s;ary in their operation as heat and cold, moi&s;t and dry: But taking them to be free and entirely our own, 'tis u&s;ual for us to &s;et them in oppo&s;ition to the other principles of nature. Shou'd it, therefore, be demanded, whether the &s;en&s;e of virtue be natural or ar|tificial, I am of opinion, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for me at pre&s;ent to give any preci&s;e an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. Perhaps it will appear af|terwards, that our &s;en&s;e of &s;ome virtues is ar|tificial, and that of others natural.

<P>MEAN while it may not be ami&s;s to ob|&s;erve from the&s;e definitions of <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>unnatural,</HI> that nothing can be more unphi|lo&s;ophical than tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which a&s;&s;ert, that virtue is the &s;ame with what is natural, and vice with what is unnatural. For in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, Nature, as oppo&s;ed to miracles, both vice and virtue are equally na|tural; and in the &s;econd &s;en&s;e, as oppos'd to
<PB N="35" REF="44">
what is unu&s;ual, perhaps virtue will be found to be the mo&s;t unnatural. At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be own'd, that heroic virtue, being as un|u&s;ual, is as little natural as the mo&s;t brutal barbarity. As to the third &s;en&s;e of the word, 'tis certain, that both vice and virtue are equally artificial, and out of nature. For however it may be di&s;puted, whether the notion of a merit or demerit in certain ac|tions be natural or artificial, 'tis evident, that the actions them&s;elves are artificial, and are perform'd with a certain de&s;ign and intention; otherwi&s;e they cou'd never be rank'd under any of the&s;e denominations.

<P>THUS we are &s;till brought back to our fir&s;t po&s;ition, that virtue is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the plea&s;ure, and vice by the pain, that any action, &s;entiment or character gives us by the mere view and contemplation. This deci&s;ion is very commodious; becau&s;e it re|duces us to this &s;imple que&s;tion, <HI>Why any action or &s;entiment upon the general view or &s;urvey, gives a certain &s;atisfaction or unea|&s;ine&s;s,</HI> in order to &s;hew the origin of its mo|ral rectitude or depravity, without looking for any incomprehen&s;ible relations and qua|lities,

<HEAD>SECT. I. <HI>Ju&s;tice, whether a natural or artifi|cial virtue?</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE already hinted, that our &s;en&s;e of every kind of virtue is not natural; but that there are &s;ome virtues, that produce plea|&s;ure and approbation by means of an ar|tifice or contrivance, which ari&s;es from the circum&s;tances and nece&s;&s;ity of mankind. Of this kind I a&s;&s;ert <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to be; and &s;hall endeavour to defend this opinion by a &s;hort, and, I hope, convincing argument, before I examine the nature of the artifice, from which the &s;en&s;e of that virtue is derived.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="47">
'TIS evident, that when we prai&s;e any actions, we regard only the motives that produced them, and con&s;ider the actions as &s;igns or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external per|formance has no merit. We mu&s;t look within to find the moral quality. This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our attention on actions, as on external &s;igns. But the&s;e actions are &s;till con&s;idered as &s;igns; and the ultimate object of our prai&s;e and approbation is the motive, that produc'd them.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ame manner, when we re|quire any action, or blame a per&s;on for not performing it, we always &s;uppo&s;e, that one in that &s;ituation &s;hou'd be influenc'd by the proper motive of that action, and we e&s;teem it vicious in him to be regardle&s;s of it. If we find, upon enquiry, that the virtuous motive was &s;till powerful over his brea&s;t, tho' check'd in its operation by &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances unknown to us, we retract our blame, and have the &s;ame e&s;teem for him, as if he had actually perform'd the action, which we require of him.</P>
<P>IT appears, therefore, that all virtuous actions derive their merit only from virtuous motives, and are con&s;ider'd merely as &s;igns
<PB N="39" REF="48">
of tho&s;e motives. From this principle I con|clude, that the fir&s;t virtuous motive, which be&s;tows a merit on any action, can never be a regard to the virtue of that action, but mu&s;t be &s;ome other natural motive or prin|ciple. To &s;uppo&s;e, that the mere regard to the virtue of the action, may be the fir&s;t motive, which produc'd the action, and render'd it virtuous, is to rea&s;on in a circle. Before we can have &s;uch a regard, the ac|tion mu&s;t be really virtuous; and this virtue mu&s;t be deriv'd from &s;ome virtuous motive: And con&s;equently the virtuous motive mu&s;t be different from the regard to the virtue of the action. A virtuous motive is requi&s;ite to render an action virtuous. An action mu&s;t be virtuous, before we can have a regard to its virtue. Some virtuous motive, therefore, mu&s;t be antecedent to that regard.</P>
<P>NOR is this merely a metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtil|ty; but enters into all our rea&s;onings in common life, tho' perhaps we may not be able to place it in &s;uch di&s;tinct philo&s;ophical terms. We blame a father for neglecting his child. Why? becau&s;e it &s;hews a want of natural affection, which is the duty of every parent. Were not natural affection a duty, the care of children cou'd not be a duty; and 'twere impo&s;&s;ible we cou'd have the duty
<PB N="40" REF="49" MS="y">
in our eye in the attention we give to our offspring. In this ca&s;e, therefore, all men &s;uppo&s;e a motive to the action di&s;tinct from a &s;en&s;e of duty.</P>
<P>HERE is a man, that does many benevo|lent actions; relieves the di&s;tre&s;s'd, comforts the afflicted, and extends his bounty even to the greate&s;t &s;trangers. No character can be more amiable and virtuous. We regard the&s;e actions as proofs of the greate&s;t humanity. This humanity be&s;tows a merit on the ac|tions. A regard to this merit is, therefore, a &s;econdary con&s;ideration, and deriv'd from the antecedent principles of humanity, which is meritorious and laudable.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, it may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd as an un|doubted maxim, <HI>that no action can be vir|tuous, or morally good, unle&s;s there be in hu|man nature &s;ome motive to produce it, di&s;tinct from the &s;en&s;e of its morality.</HI></P>
<P>BUT may not the &s;en&s;e of morality or duty produce an action, without any other motive? I an&s;wer, It may: But this is no objection to the pre&s;ent doctrine. When any virtuous motive or principle is common in human nature, a per&s;on, who feels his heart devoid of that motive, may hate him|&s;elf upon that account, and may perform the action without the motive, from a cer|tain
<PB N="41" REF="50">
&s;en&s;e of duty, in order to acquire by practice, that virtuous principle, or at lea&s;t, to di&s;gui&s;e to him&s;elf, as much as po&s;&s;ible, his want of it. A man that really feels no gratitude in his temper, is &s;till pleas'd to perform grateful actions, and thinks he has, by that means, fulfill'd his duty. Actions are at fir&s;t only con&s;ider'd as &s;igns of mo|tives: But 'tis u&s;ual, in this ca&s;e, as in all others, to fix our attention on the &s;igns, and neglect, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the thing &s;igni|fy'd. But tho', on &s;ome occa&s;ions, a per&s;on may perform an action merely out of regard to its moral obligation, yet &s;till this &s;uppo&s;es in human nature &s;ome di&s;tinct principles, which are capable of producing the action, and who&s;e moral beauty renders the action meritorious.</P>
<P>NOW to apply all this to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; I &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on to have lent me a &s;um of money, on condition that it be re&s;tor'd in a few days; and al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that after the expiration of the term agreed on, he de|mands the &s;um: I ask, <HI>What rea&s;on or mo|tive have I to re&s;tore the money?</HI> It will, perhaps, be &s;aid, that my regard to ju&s;tice, and abhorrence of villainy and knavery, are &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for me, if I have the lea&s;t grain of hone&s;ty, or &s;en&s;e of duty and obli|gation.
<PB N="42" REF="51">
And this an&s;wer, no doubt, is ju&s;t and &s;atisfactory to man in his civiliz'd &s;tate, and when train'd up according to a certain di&s;cipline and education. But in his rude and more <HI>natural</HI> condition, if you are pleas'd to call &s;uch a condition natural, this an&s;wer wou'd be rejected as perfectly unin|telligible and &s;ophi&s;tical. For one in that &s;ituation wou'd immediately ask you, <HI>Where|in con&s;i&s;ts this hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice, which you find in re&s;toring a loan, and ab&s;taining from the property of others?</HI> It does not &s;urely lie in the external action. It mu&s;t, there|fore be plac'd in the motive, from which the external action is deriv'd. This motive can never be a regard to the hone&s;ty of the action. For 'tis a plain fallacy to &s;ay, that a virtuous motive is requi&s;ite to render an ac|tion hone&s;t, and at the &s;ame time that a re|gard to the hone&s;ty is the motive of the ac|tion. We can never have a regard to the virtue of an action, unle&s;s the action be an|tecedently virtuous. No action can be vir|tuous, but &s;o far as it proceeds from a virtuous motive. A virtuous motive, therefore, mu&s;t precede the regard to the virtue; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, that the virtuous motive and the regard to the virtue can be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52">
'TIS requi&s;ite, then, to find &s;ome motive to acts of ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty, di&s;tinct from our regard to the hone&s;ty; and in this lies the great difficulty. For &s;hou'd we &s;ay, that a concern for our private intere&s;t or repu|tation is the legitimate motive to all hone&s;t actions; it wou'd follow, that wherever that concern cea&s;es, hone&s;ty can no longer have place. But 'tis certain, that &s;elf-love, when it acts at its liberty, in&s;tead of engaging us to hone&s;t actions, is the &s;ource of all inju|&s;tice and violence; nor can a man ever cor|rect tho&s;e vices, without correcting and re|&s;training the <HI>natural</HI> movements of that ap|petite.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hou'd it be affirm'd, that the rea|&s;on or motive of &s;uch actions is the <HI>regard to publick intere&s;t,</HI> to which nothing is more contrary than examples of inju&s;tice and di&s;|hone&s;ty; &s;hou'd this be &s;aid, I wou'd pro|po&s;e the three following con&s;iderations, as worthy of our attention. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> public in|tere&s;t is not naturally attach'd to the ob&s;er|vation of the rules of ju&s;tice; but is only connected with it, after an artificial conven|tion for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e rules, as &s;hall be &s;hewn more at large hereafter. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> if we &s;uppo&s;e, that the loan was &s;e|cret, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary for the intere&s;t of
<PB N="44" REF="53">
the per&s;on, that the money be re&s;tor'd in the &s;ame manner (as when the lender wou'd conceal his riches) in that ca&s;e the example cea&s;es, and the public is no longer intere&s;ted in the actions of the borrower; tho' I &s;up|po&s;e there is no morali&s;t, who will affirm, that the duty and obligation cea&s;es. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> experience &s;ufficiently proves, that men, in the ordinary conduct of life, look not &s;o far as the public intere&s;t, when they pay their creditors, perform their promi&s;es, and ab|&s;tain from theft, and robbery, and inju&s;tice of every kind. That is a motive too remote and too &s;ublime to affect the generality of mankind, and operate with any force in ac|tions &s;o contrary to private intere&s;t as are frequently tho&s;e of ju&s;tice and common ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>IN general, it may be affirm'd, that there is no &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as &s;uch, indepen|dent of per&s;onal qualities, of &s;ervices, or of relation to our&s;elf. 'Tis true, there is no human, and indeed no &s;en&s;ible, creature, who&s;e happine&s;s or mi&s;ery does not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, affect us, when brought near to us, and repre&s;ented in lively colours: But this proceeds merely from &s;ympathy, and is no proof of &s;uch an univer&s;al affection to man|kind,
<PB N="45" REF="54">
&s;ince this concern extends it&s;elf beyond our own &s;pecies. An affection betwixt the &s;exes is a pa&s;&s;ion evidently implanted in hu|man nature; and this pa&s;&s;ion not only ap|pears in its peculiar &s;ymptoms, but al&s;o in inflaming every other principle of affection, and rai&s;ing a &s;tronger love from beauty, wit, kindne&s;s, than what wou'd otherwi&s;e flow from them. Were there an univer&s;al love among all human creatures, it wou'd appear after the &s;ame manner. Any degree of a good quality wou'd cau&s;e a &s;tronger affection than the &s;ame degree of a bad quality wou'd cau&s;e hatred; contrary to what we find by experience. Men's tempers are different, and &s;ome have a propen&s;ity to the tender, and others to the rougher, affections: But in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is nothing but the object both of love and hatred, and re|quires &s;ome other cau&s;e, which by a double relation of impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, may ex|cite the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. In vain wou'd we en|deavour to elude this hypothe&s;is. There are no phaenomena that point out any &s;uch kind affection to men, independent of their merit, and every other circum&s;tance. We love company in general; but 'tis as we love any other amu&s;ement. An <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in
<PB N="46" REF="55">
<HI>Italy</HI> is a friend: A <HI>Europaean</HI> in <HI>China;</HI> and perhaps a man wou'd be belov'd as &s;uch, were we to meet him in the moon. But this proceeds only from the relation to our&s;elves; which in the&s;e ca&s;es gathers force by being confined to a few per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IF public benevolence, therefore, or a regard to the intere&s;ts of mankind, cannot be the original motive to ju&s;tice, much le&s;s can <HI>private benevolence,</HI> or a <HI>regard to the in|tere&s;ts of the party concern'd,</HI> be this mo|tive. For what if he be my enemy, and has given me ju&s;t cau&s;e to hate him? What if he be a vicious man, and de&s;erves the ha|tred of all mankind? What if he be a mi|&s;er, and can make no u&s;e of what I wou'd deprive him of? What if he be a profli|gate debauchee, and wou'd rather receive harm than benefit from large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? What if I be in nece&s;&s;ity, and have urgent motives to acquire &s;omething to my family? In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the original motive to ju&s;tice wou'd fail; and con&s;equently the ju&s;tice it&s;elf, and along with it all property, right, and obligation.</P>
<P>A RICH man lies under a moral obliga|tion to communicate to tho&s;e in nece&s;&s;ity a &s;hare of his &s;uperfluities. Were private be|nevolence the original motive to ju&s;tice, a
<PB N="47" REF="56" MS="y">
man wou'd not be oblig'd to leave others in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more than he is oblig'd to give them. At lea&s;t the difference wou'd be very incon&s;iderable. Men generally fix their affections more on what they are po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of, than on what they never enjoy'd: For this rea&s;on, it wou'd be greater cruelty to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s a man of any thing, than not to give it him. But who will a&s;&s;ert, that this is the only foundation of ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>BESIDES, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the chief rea&s;on, why men attach them&s;elves &s;o much to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is, that they con&s;ider them as their property, and as &s;ecur'd to them inviolably by the laws of &s;ociety. But this is a &s;econdary con&s;ideration, and depen|dent on the preceding notions of ju&s;tice and property.</P>
<P>A MAN'S property is &s;uppos'd to be fenc'd again&s;t every mortal, in every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e. But private benevolence is, and ought to be, weaker in &s;ome per&s;ons, than in others: And in many, or indeed in mo&s;t per&s;ons, mu&s;t ab&s;olutely fail. Private benevolence, therefore, is not the original motive of ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P>FROM all this it follows, that we have no real or univer&s;al motive for ob&s;erving the laws of equity, but the very equity and me|rit
<PB N="48" REF="57">
of that ob&s;ervance; and as no action can be equitable or meritorious, where it cannot ari&s;e from &s;ome &s;eparate motive, there is here an evident &s;ophi&s;try and rea&s;oning in a circle. Unle&s;s, therefore, we will allow, that nature has e&s;tabli&s;h'd a &s;ophi&s;try, and render'd it nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable, we mu&s;t allow, that the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and in|ju&s;tice is not deriv'd from nature, but ari&s;es artificially, tho' nece&s;&s;arily from education, and human conventions.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, as a corollary to this rea|&s;oning, that &s;ince no action can be laudable or blameable, without &s;ome motives or im|pelling pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;tinct from the &s;en&s;e of morals, the&s;e di&s;tinct pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t have a great influence on that &s;en&s;e. 'Tis accord|ing to their general force in human nature, that we blame or prai&s;e. In judging of the beauty of animal bodies, we always carry in our eye the oeconomy of a certain &s;pecies; and where the limbs and features ob&s;erve that proportion, which is common to the &s;pecies, we pronounce them hand&s;ome and beautiful. In like manner we always con&s;i|der the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>u&s;ual</HI> force of the pa&s;|&s;ions, when we determine concerning vice and virtue; and if the pa&s;&s;ions depart very much from the common mea&s;ures on either
<PB N="49" REF="58">
&s;ide, they are always di&s;approv'd as vicious. A man naturally loves his children better than his nephews, his nephews better than his cou&s;ins, his cou&s;ins better than &s;trangers, where every thing el&s;e is equal. Hence ari&s;e our common mea&s;ures of duty, in preferring the one to the other. Our &s;en&s;e of duty al|ways follows the common and natural cour&s;e of our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>TO avoid giving offence, I mu&s;t here ob|&s;erve, that when I deny ju&s;tice to be a na|tural virtue, I make u&s;e of the word, <HI>natu|ral,</HI> only as oppos'd to <HI>artificial.</HI> In ano|ther &s;en&s;e of the word; as no principle of the human mind is more natural than a &s;en&s;e of virtue; &s;o no virtue is more natural than ju&s;tice. Mankind is an inventive &s;pecies; and where an invention is obvious and ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, it may as properly be &s;aid to be natural as any thing that proceeds im|mediately from original principles, without the intervention of thought or reflection. Tho' the rules of ju&s;tice be <HI>artificial,</HI> they are not <HI>arbitrary.</HI> Nor is the expre&s;&s;ion improper to call them <HI>Laws of Nature;</HI> if by natural we under&s;tand what is common to any &s;pecies, or even if we confine it to mean what is in&s;eparable from the &s;pecies.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of the origin of ju&s;tice and property.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE now proceed to examine two que|&s;tions, viz. <HI>concerning the manner, in which the rules of ju&s;tice are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the artifice of men;</HI> and <HI>concerning the rea|&s;ons, which determine us to attribute to the ob&s;ervance or neglect of the&s;e rules a moral beauty and deformity.</HI> The&s;e que&s;tions will appear afterwards to be di&s;tinct. We &s;hall begin with the former.</P>
<P>OF all the animals, with which this globe is peopled, there is none towards whom na|ture &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to have exercis'd more cruelty than towards man, in the numberle&s;s wants and nece&s;&s;ities, with which &s;he has loaded him, and in the &s;lender means, which &s;he affords to the relieving the&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ities. In other creatures the&s;e two par|ticulars generally compen&s;ate each other. If we con&s;ider the lion as a voracious and carnivorous animal, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cover him to be very nece&s;&s;itous; but if we turn
<PB N="51" REF="60">
our eye to his make and temper, his agility, his courage, his arms, and his force, we &s;hall find, that his advantages hold pro|portion with his wants. The &s;heep and ox are depriv'd of all the&s;e advantages; but their appetites are moderate, and their food is of ea&s;y purcha&s;e. In man alone, this un|natural conjunction of infirmity, and of nece&s;&s;ity, may be ob&s;erv'd in its greate&s;t per|fection. Not only the food, which is re|quir'd for his &s;u&s;tenance, flies his &s;earch and approach, or at lea&s;t requires his labour to be produc'd, but he mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of cloaths and lodging, to defend him again&s;t the injuries of the weather; tho' to con&s;ider him only in him&s;elf, he is provided neither with arms, nor force, nor other natural abilities, which are in any degree an&s;werable to &s;o many nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>'TIS by &s;ociety alone he is able to &s;upply his defects, and rai&s;e him&s;elf up to an equa|lity with his fellow-creatures, and even ac|quire a &s;uperiority above them. By &s;ociety all his infirmities are compen&s;ated; and tho' in that &s;ituation his wants multiply every moment upon him, yet his abilities are &s;till more augmented, and leave him in every re&s;pect more &s;atisfied and happy, than 'tis po&s;&s;ible for him, in his &s;avage and &s;olitary
<PB N="52" REF="61" MS="y">
condition, ever to become. When every in|dividual per&s;on labours a-part, and only for him&s;elf, his force is too &s;mall to execute any con&s;iderable work; his labour being em|ploy'd in &s;upplying all his different nece&s;&s;i|ties, he never attains a perfection in any par|ticular art; and as his force and &s;ucce&s;s are not at all times equal, the lea&s;t failure in either of the&s;e particulars mu&s;t be attended with inevitable ruin and mi&s;ery. Society provides a remedy for the&s;e <HI>three</HI> incon|veniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employments, our ability encrea&s;es: And by mutual &s;uccour we are le&s;s expos'd to fortune and accidents. 'Tis by this addi|tional <HI>force, ability,</HI> and <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> that &s;o|ciety becomes advantageous.</P>
<P>BUT in order to form &s;ociety, 'tis re|qui&s;ite not only that it be advantageous, but al&s;o that men be &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e advantages; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, in their wild uncultivated &s;tate, that by &s;tudy and reflection alone, they &s;hould ever be able to attain this know|ledge. Mo&s;t fortunately, therefore, there is conjoin'd to tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, who&s;e re|medies are remote and ob&s;cure, another nece&s;&s;ity, which having a pre&s;ent and more obvious remedy, may ju&s;tly be regarded as
<PB N="53" REF="62">
the fir&s;t and original principle of human &s;ociety. This nece&s;&s;ity is no other than that natural appetite betwixt the &s;exes, which unites them together, and pre&s;erves their union, till a new tye takes place in their concern for their common offspring. This new concern becomes al&s;o a principle of union betwixt the parents and offspring, and forms a more numerous &s;ociety; where the parents govern by the advantage of their &s;uperior &s;trength and wi&s;dom, and at the &s;ame time are re&s;train'd in the exerci&s;e of their authority by that natural affection, which they bear their children. In a little time, cu&s;tom and habit operating on the tender minds of the children, makes them &s;en&s;ible of the advantages, which they may reap from &s;ociety, as well as fa&s;hions them by degrees for it, by rubbing off tho&s;e rough corners and untoward affections, which pre|vent their coalition.</P>
<P>FOR it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that however the circum&s;tances of human nature may render an union nece&s;&s;ary, and however tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of lu&s;t and natural affection may &s;eem to render it unavoidable; yet there are other particulars in our <HI>natural temper,</HI> and in our <HI>outward circum&s;tances,</HI> which are very incommodious, and are even contrary to the
<PB N="54" REF="63">
requi&s;ite conjunction. Among the former, we may ju&s;tly e&s;teem our <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. I am &s;en&s;ible, that, generally &s;peaking, the repre&s;entations of this quality have been carried much too far; and that the de&s;criptions, which certain phi|lo&s;ophers delight &s;o much to form of man|kind in this particular, are as wide of na|ture as any accounts of mon&s;ters, which we meet with in fables and romances. So far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond them&s;elves, I am of opinion, that tho' it be rare to meet with one, who loves any &s;ingle per&s;on better than him&s;elf; yet 'tis as rare to meet with one, in whom all the kind affections, taken to|gether, do not over-balance all the &s;elfi&s;h. Con&s;ult common experience: Do you not &s;ee, that tho' the whole expence of the fa|mily be generally under the direction of the ma&s;ter of it, yet there are few that do not be&s;tow the large&s;t part of their fortunes on the plea&s;ures of their wives, and the educa|tion of their children, re&s;erving the &s;malle&s;t portion for their own proper u&s;e and enter|tainment. This is what we may ob&s;erve concerning &s;uch as have tho&s;e endearing ties; and may pre&s;ume, that the ca&s;e would
<PB N="55" REF="64">
be the &s;ame with others, were they plac'd in a like &s;ituation.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this genero&s;ity mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd to the honour of human nature, we may at the &s;ame time remark, that &s;o noble an affection, in&s;tead of fitting men for large &s;ocieties, is almo&s;t as contrary to them, as the mo&s;t narrow &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. For while each per&s;on loves him&s;elf better than any other &s;ingle per&s;on, and in his love to others bears the greate&s;t affection to his relations and ac|quaintance, this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce an oppo&s;ition of pa&s;&s;ions, and a con&s;equent oppo&s;ition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the new-e&s;tabli&s;h'd union.</P>
<P>'TIS however worth while to remark, that this contrariety of pa&s;&s;ions wou'd be attended with but &s;mall danger, did it not concur with a peculiarity in our <HI>outward cir|cum&s;tances,</HI> which affords it an opportunity of exerting it&s;elf. There are three different &s;pecies of goods, which we are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of; the internal &s;atisfaction of our minds, the external advantages of our body, and the enjoyment of &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as we have acquir'd by our indu&s;try and good fortune. We are perfectly &s;ecure in the enjoyment of the fir&s;t. The &s;econd may be ravi&s;h'd from us, but can be of no advantage to him who
<PB N="56" REF="65">
deprives us of them. The la&s;t only are both expos'd to the violence of others, and may be transferr'd without &s;uffering any lo&s;s or alteration; while at the &s;ame time, there is not a &s;ufficient quantity of them to &s;upply every one's de&s;ires and nece&s;&s;ities. As the improvement, therefore, of the&s;e goods is the chief advantage of &s;ociety, &s;o the <HI>in&s;ta|bility</HI> of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, along with their <HI>&s;carcity,</HI> is the chief impediment.</P>
<P>IN vain &s;hou'd we expect to find, in <HI>un|cultivated nature,</HI> a remedy to this inconve|nience; or hope for any inartificial principle of the human mind, which might controul tho&s;e partial affections, and make us over|come the temptations ari&s;ing from cur cir|cum&s;tances. The idea of ju&s;tice can never &s;erve to this purpo&s;e, or be taken for a na|tural principle, capable of in&s;piring men with an equitable conduct towards each other. That virtue, as it is now under&s;tood, wou'd never have been dream'd of among rude and &s;avage men. For the notion of in|jury or inju&s;tice implies an immorality or vice committed again&s;t &s;ome other per&s;on: And as every immorality is deriv'd from &s;ome defect or un&s;oundne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions, and as this defect mu&s;t be judg'd of, in a great mea|&s;ure, from the ordinary cour&s;e of nature in
<PB N="57" REF="66">
the con&s;titution of the mind; 'twill be ea&s;y to know, whether we be guilty of any im|morality, with regard to others, by con&s;ider|ing the natural, and u&s;ual force of tho&s;e &s;e|veral affections, which are directed towards them. Now it appears, that in the original frame of our mind, our &s;tronge&s;t attention is confin'd to our&s;elves; our next is extended to our relations and acquaintance; and 'tis only the weake&s;t which reaches to &s;trangers and indifferent per&s;ons. This partiality, then, and unequal affection, mu&s;t not only have an influence on our behaviour and con|duct in &s;ociety, but even on our ideas of vice and virtue; &s;o as to make us regard any remarkable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a de|gree of partiality, either by too great an en|largement, or contraction of the affections, as vicious and immoral. This we may ob|&s;erve in our common judgments concern|ing actions, where we blame a per&s;on, who either centers all his affections in his fami|ly, or is &s;o regardle&s;s of them, as, in any oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, to give the preference to a &s;tranger, or mere chance acquaintance. From all which it follows, that our natural uncultivated ideas of morality, in&s;tead of providing a remedy for the partiality of our affections, do rather conform them&s;elves to
<PB N="58" REF="67">
that partiality, and give it an additional force and influence.</P>
<P>THE remedy, then, is not deriv'd from nature, but from <HI>artifice;</HI> or more properly &s;peaking, nature provides a remedy in the judgment and under&s;tanding, for what is irregular and incommodious in the affec|tions. For when men, from their early e|ducation in &s;ociety, have become &s;en&s;ible of the infinite advantages that re&s;ult from it, and have be&s;ides acquir'd a new affection to company and conver&s;ation; and when they have ob&s;erv'd, that the principal di&s;turbance in &s;ociety ari&s;es from tho&s;e goods, which we call external, and from their loo&s;ene&s;s and ea&s;y tran&s;ition from one per&s;on to another; they mu&s;t &s;eek for a remedy, by putting the&s;e goods, as far as po&s;&s;ible, on the &s;ame footing with the fix'd and con&s;tant advan|tages of the mind and body. This can be done after no other manner, than by a con|vention enter'd into by all the members of the &s;ociety to be&s;tow &s;tability on the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e external goods, and leave every one in the peaceable enjoyment of what he may acquire by his fortune and in|du&s;try. By this means, every one knows what he may &s;afely po&s;&s;e&s;s; and the pa&s;&s;ions are re&s;train'd in their partial and contradi|ctory
<PB N="59" REF="68">
motions. Nor is &s;uch a re&s;traint con|trary to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; for if &s;o, it cou'd never be enter'd into, nor maintain'd; but it is only contrary to their heedle&s;s and im|petuous movement. In&s;tead of departing from our own intere&s;t, or from that of our neare&s;t friends, by ab&s;taining from the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of others, we cannot better con&s;ult both the&s;e intere&s;ts, than by &s;uch a conven|tion; becau&s;e it is by that means we maintain &s;ociety, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their well|being and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as well as to our own.</P>
<P>THIS convention is not of the nature of a <HI>promi&s;e:</HI> For even promi&s;es them&s;elves, as we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards, ari&s;e from human conventions. It is only a general &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t; which &s;en&s;e all the mem|bers of the &s;ociety expre&s;s to one another, and which induces them to regulate their conduct by certain rules. I ob&s;erve, that it will be for my intere&s;t to leave another in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his goods, <HI>provided</HI> he will act in the &s;ame manner with regard to me. He is &s;en&s;ible of a like intere&s;t in the regulation of his conduct. When this common &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t is mutually expre&s;s'd, and is known to both, it produces a &s;uitable re&s;olution and behaviour. And this may properly enough be call'd a convention or agreement
<PB N="60" REF="69">
betwixt us, tho' without the interpo&s;ition of a promi&s;e; &s;ince the actions of each of us have a reference to tho&s;e of the other, and are perform'd upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;omething is to be perform'd on the other part. Two men, who pull the oars of a boat, do it by an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promi&s;es to each other. Nor is the rule concerning the &s;ta|bility of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the le&s;s deriv'd from hu|man conventions, that it ari&s;es gradually, and acquires force by a &s;low progre&s;&s;ion, and by our repeated experience of the inconveni|ences of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing it. On the contrary, this experience a&s;&s;ures us &s;till more, that the &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t has become common to all our fellows, and gives us a confidence of the future regularity of their conduct: And 'tis only on the expectation of this, that our moderation and ab&s;tinence are founded. In like manner are languages gradually e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by human conventions without any promi&s;e. In like manner do gold and &s;ilver become the common mea&s;ures of exchange, and are e&s;teem'd &s;ufficient payment for what is of a hundred times their value.</P>
<P>AFTER this convention, concerning ab|&s;tinence from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of others, is enter'd into, and every one has acquir'd
<PB N="61" REF="70">
a &s;tability in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, there immedi|ately ari&s;e the ideas of ju&s;tice and inju|&s;tice; as al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>property, right,</HI> and <HI>obligation.</HI> The latter are altogether unin|telligible without fir&s;t under&s;tanding the former. Our property is nothing but tho&s;e goods, who&s;e con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the laws of &s;ociety; that is, by the laws of ju&s;tice. Tho&s;e, therefore, who make u&s;e of the words <HI>property,</HI> or <HI>right,</HI> or <HI>obliga|tion,</HI> before they have explain'd the ori|gin of ju&s;tice, or even make u&s;e of it in that explication, are guilty of a very gro&s;s fallacy, and can never rea&s;on upon any &s;o|lid foundation. A man's property is &s;ome object related to him. This relation is not natural, but moral, and founded on ju&s;tice. 'Tis very prepo&s;terous, therefore, to ima|gine, that we can have any idea of property, without fully comprehending the nature of ju&s;tice, and &s;hewing its origin in the artifice and contrivance of men. The origin of ju|&s;tice explains that of property, The &s;ame artifice gives ri&s;e to both. As our fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural &s;entiment of morals is founded on the nature of our pa&s;&s;ions, and gives the preference to our&s;elves and friends, above &s;trangers; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible there can be natu|rally any &s;uch thing as a fix'd right or pro|perty,
<PB N="62" REF="71">
while the oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions of men impel them in contrary directions, and are not re&s;train'd by any convention or agree|ment.</P>
<P>No one can doubt, that the convention for the di&s;tinction of property, and for the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is of all circum&s;tances the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of human &s;ociety, and that after the agreement for the fixing and ob&s;erving of this rule, there remains little or nothing to be done towards &s;ettling a perfect harmony and con|cord. All the other pa&s;&s;ions, be&s;ide this of intere&s;t, are either ea&s;ily re&s;train'd, or are not of &s;uch pernicious con&s;equence, when indulg'd. <HI>Vanity</HI> is rather to be e&s;teem'd a &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion, and a bond of union among men. <HI>Pity</HI> and <HI>love</HI> are to be con&s;ider'd in the &s;ame light. And as to <HI>envy</HI> and <HI>revenge,</HI> tho' pernicious, they operate only by inter|vals, and are directed again&s;t particular per|&s;ons, whom we con&s;ider as our &s;uperiors or enemies. This avidity alone, of acquiring goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for our&s;elves and our neare&s;t friends, is in&s;atiable, perpetual, uni|ver&s;al, and directly de&s;tructive of &s;ociety. There &s;carce is any one, who is not actuated by it; and there is no one, who has not rea&s;on to fear from it, when it acts without
<PB N="63" REF="72" MS="y">
any re&s;traint, and gives way to its fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural movements. So that upon the whole, we are to e&s;teem the difficulties in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ociety, to be greater or le&s;s, according to tho&s;e we encounter in re|gulating and re&s;training this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that no affection of the hu|man mind has both a &s;ufficient force, and a proper direction to counter-balance the love of gain, and render men fit members of &s;ociety, by making them ab&s;tain from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of others. Benevolence to &s;tran|gers is too weak for this purpo&s;e; and as to the other pa&s;&s;ions, they rather inflame this avidity, when we ob&s;erve, that the larger our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are, the more ability we have of gratifying all our appetites. There is no pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, capable of controlling the intere&s;ted affection, but the very affection it &s;elf, by an alteration of its direction. Now this alteration mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take place up|on the lea&s;t reflection; &s;ince 'tis evident, that the pa&s;&s;ion is much better &s;atisfy'd by its re|&s;traint, than by its liberty, and that in pre|&s;erving &s;ociety, we make much greater ad|vances in the acquiring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than in the &s;olitary and forlorn condition, which mu&s;t follow upon violence and an univer&s;al licence. The que&s;tion, therefore, concern|ing
<PB N="64" REF="73">
the wickedne&s;s or goodne&s;s of human nature, enters not in the lea&s;t into that other que&s;tion concerning the origin of &s;ociety; nor is there any thing to be con&s;ider'd but the degrees of men's &s;agacity or folly. For whether the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-intere&s;t be e&s;teem|ed vicious or virtuous, 'tis all a ca&s;e; &s;ince it&s;elf alone re&s;trains it: So that if it be vir|tuous, men become &s;ocial by their virtue; if vicious, their vice has the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Now as 'tis by e&s;tabli&s;hing the rule for the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that this pa&s;&s;ion re&s;trains it&s;elf; if that rule be very ab&s;tru&s;e, and of difficult invention; &s;ociety mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd, in a manner, accidental, and the effect of many ages. But if it be found, that nothing can be more &s;imple and obvi|ous than that rule; that every parent, in order to pre&s;erve peace among his children, mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h it; and that the&s;e fir&s;t rudiments of ju&s;tice mu&s;t every day be improv'd, as the &s;ociety enlarges: If all this appear evi|dent, as it certainly mu&s;t, we may conclude, that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible for men to remain any con&s;iderable time in that &s;avage condi|tion, which precedes &s;ociety; but that his very fir&s;t &s;tate and &s;ituation may ju&s;tly be e&s;teem'd &s;ocial. This, however, hinders not, but that philo&s;ophers may, if they plea&s;e,
<PB N="65" REF="74">
extend their rea&s;oning to the &s;uppos'd <HI>&s;tate of nature;</HI> provided they allow it to be a mere philo&s;ophical fiction, which never had, and never cou'd have any reality. Human nature being compos'd of two principal parts, which are requi&s;ite in all its actions, the affections and under&s;tanding; 'tis cer|tain, that the blind motions of the former, without the direction of the latter, incapa|citate men for &s;ociety: And it may be al|low'd us to con&s;ider &s;eparately the effects, that re&s;ult from the &s;eparate operations of the&s;e two component parts of the mind. The &s;ame liberty may be permitted to mo|ral, which is allow'd to natural philo&s;ophers; and 'tis very u&s;ual with the latter to con&s;ider any motion as compounded and con&s;i&s;ting of two parts &s;eparate from each other, tho' at the &s;ame time they acknowledge it to be in it&s;elf uncompounded and in&s;eparable.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>&s;tate of nature,</HI> therefore, is to be regarded as a mere fiction, not unlike that of the <HI>golden age,</HI> which poets have inven|ted; only with this difference, that the for|mer is de&s;crib'd as full of war, violence and inju&s;tice; whereas the latter is painted out to us, as the mo&s;t charming and mo&s;t peace|able condition, that can po&s;&s;ibly be ima|gin'd. The &s;ea&s;ons, in that fir&s;t age of na|ture,

were &s;o temperate, if we may believe the poets, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for men to provide them&s;elves with cloaths and hou&s;es as a &s;ecurity again&s;t the violence of heat and cold. The rivers flow'd with wine and milk: The oaks yielded honey; and nature &s;pontaneou&s;ly produc'd her greate&s;t delicacies. Nor were the&s;e the chief advan|tages of that happy age. The &s;torms and tempe&s;ts were not alone remov'd from na|ture; but tho&s;e more furious tempe&s;ts were unknown to human brea&s;ts, which now cau&s;e &s;uch uproar, and engender &s;uch confu|&s;ion. Avarice, ambition, cruelty, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, were never heard of: Cordial affection, compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ympathy, were the only move|ments, with which the human mind was yet acquainted. Even the di&s;tinction of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine</HI> was bani&s;h'd from that happy race of mortals, and carry'd with them the very notions of property and obligation, ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THIS, no doubt, is to be regarded as an idle fiction; but yet de&s;erves our attention, becau&s;e nothing can more evidently &s;hew the origin of tho&s;e virtues, which are the &s;ubjects of our pre&s;ent enquiry. I have al|ready ob&s;erv'd, that ju&s;tice takes its ri&s;e from human conventions; and that the&s;e are in|tended
<PB N="67" REF="76">
as a remedy to &s;ome inconveniences, which proceed from the concurrence of cer|tain <HI>qualities</HI> of the human mind with the <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of external objects. The qualities of the mind are <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> and <HI>limited gene|ro&s;ity:</HI> And the &s;ituation of external objects is their <HI>ea&s;y change,</HI> join'd to their <HI>&s;carcity</HI> in compari&s;on of the wants and de&s;ires of men. But however philo&s;ophers may have been bewilder'd in tho&s;e &s;peculations, poets have been guided more infallibly, by a cer|tain ta&s;te or common in&s;tinct, which in mo&s;t kinds of rea&s;oning goes farther than any of that art and philo&s;ophy, with which we have been yet acquainted. They ea&s;ily perceiv'd, if every man had a tender re|gard for another, or if nature &s;upplied abun|dantly all our wants and de&s;ires, that the jealou&s;y of intere&s;t, which ju&s;tice &s;uppo&s;es, could no longer have place; nor would there be any occa&s;ion for tho&s;e di&s;tinctions and limits of property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which at pre&s;ent are in u&s;e among mankind. En|crea&s;e to a &s;ufficient degree the benevolence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render ju&s;tice u&s;ele&s;s, by &s;upplying its place with much nobler virtues, and more valuable ble&s;&s;ings. The &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of men is animated by the few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions we have, in propor|tion
<PB N="68" REF="77">
to our wants; and 'tis to re&s;train this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that men have been oblig'd to &s;eparate them&s;elves from the community, and to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt their own goods and tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>NOR need we have recour&s;e to the fictions of poets to learn this; but be&s;ide the rea&s;on of the thing, may di&s;cover the &s;ame truth by common experience and ob&s;ervation. 'Tis ea&s;y to remark, that a cordial affecton ren|ders all things common among friends; and that married people in particular mutually lo&s;e their property, and are unacquainted with the <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine,</HI> which are &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, and yet cau&s;e &s;uch di&s;turbance in hu|man &s;ociety. The &s;ame effect ari&s;es from any alteration in the circum&s;tances of man|kind; as when there is &s;uch a plenty of any thing as &s;atisfies all the de&s;ires of men: In which ca&s;e the di&s;tinction of property is entirely lo&s;t, and every thing remains in com|mon. This we may ob&s;erve with regard to air and water, tho' the mo&s;t valuable of all external objects; and may ea&s;ily conclude, that if men were &s;upplied with every thing in the &s;ame abundance, or if <HI>every one</HI> had the &s;ame affection and tender regard for <HI>every one</HI> as for him&s;elf; ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice would be equally unknown among mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="78">
HERE then is a propo&s;ition, which, I think, may be regarded as certain, <HI>that 'tis only from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and confin'd genero&s;ity of men, along with the &s;canty provi&s;ion nature has made for his wants, that ju&s;tice derives its origin.</HI> If we look backward we &s;hall find, that this propo&s;ition be&s;tows an addi|tional force on &s;ome of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, which we have already made on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> we may conclude from it, that a regard to public intere&s;t, or a &s;trong exten|&s;ive benevolence, is not our fir&s;t and original motive for the ob&s;ervation of the rules of ju&s;tice; &s;ince 'tis allow'd, that if men were endow'd with &s;uch a benevolence, the&s;e rules would never have been dreamt of.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> we may conclude from the &s;ame principle, that the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice is not founded on rea&s;on, or on the di&s;covery of certain connexions and relations of ideas, which are eternal, immutable, and univer|&s;ally obligatory. For &s;ince it is confe&s;t, that &s;uch an alteration as that above-mention'd, in the temper and circum&s;tances of mankind, wou'd entirely alter our duties and obligations, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary upon the common &s;y&s;tem, <HI>that the &s;en&s;e of virtue is deriv'd from rea&s;on,</HI> to &s;hew
<PB N="70" REF="79">
the change which this mu&s;t produce in the relations and ideas. But 'tis evident, that the only cau&s;e, why the exten&s;ive genero&s;ity of man, and the perfect abundance of every thing, wou'd de&s;troy the very idea of ju|&s;tice, is becau&s;e they render it u&s;ele&s;s; and that, on the other hand, his confin'd bene|volence, and his nece&s;&s;itous condition, give ri&s;e to that virtue, only by making it requi|&s;ite to the publick intere&s;t, and to that of every individual. 'Twas therefore a concern for our own, and the publick intere&s;t, which made us e&s;tabli&s;h the laws of ju&s;tice; and nothing can be more certain, than that it is not any relation of ideas, which gives us this concern, but our impre&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, without which every thing in nature is per|fectly indifferent to us, and can never in the lea&s;t affect us. The &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, there|fore, is not founded on our ideas, but on our impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> we may farther confirm the fore-going propo&s;ition, <HI>that tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which give ri&s;e to this &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, are not na|tural to the mind of man, but ari&s;e from ar|tifice and human conventions.</HI> For &s;ince any con&s;iderable alteration of temper and cir|cum&s;tances de&s;troys equally ju&s;tice and inju|&s;tice; and &s;ince &s;uch an alteration has an
<PB N="71" REF="80">
effect only by changing our own and the publick intere&s;t; it follows, that the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the rules of ju&s;tice depends on the&s;e different intere&s;ts. But if men pur|&s;u'd the publick intere&s;t naturally, and with a hearty affection, they wou'd never have dream'd of re&s;training each other by the&s;e rules; and if they pur&s;u'd their own inte|re&s;t, without any precaution, they wou'd run head-long into every kind of inju&s;tice and violence. The&s;e rules, therefore, are ar|tificial, and &s;eek their end in an oblique and indirect manner; nor is the intere&s;t, which gives ri&s;e to them, of a kind that cou'd be pur&s;u'd by the natural and inartificial pa&s;&s;ions of men.</P>
<P>TO make this more evident, con&s;ider, that tho' the rules of ju&s;tice are e&s;tabli&s;h'd merely by intere&s;t, their connexion with intere&s;t is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, and is different from what may be ob&s;erv'd on other occa&s;ions. A &s;ingle act of ju&s;tice is frequently contrary to <HI>public intere&s;t;</HI> and were it to &s;tand alone, without being follow'd by other acts, may, in it&s;elf, be very prejudicial to &s;ociety. When a man of merit, of a beneficent di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;tores a great fortune to a mi&s;er, or a &s;edi|tious bigot, he has acted ju&s;tly and laudably, but the public is a real &s;ufferer. Nor is
<PB N="72" REF="81">
every &s;ingle act of ju&s;tice, con&s;ider'd apart, more conducive to private intere&s;t, than to public; and 'tis ea&s;ily conceiv'd how a man may impoveri&s;h him&s;elf by a &s;ignal in&s;tance of integrity, and have rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that with regard to that &s;ingle act, the laws of ju&s;tice were for a moment &s;u&s;pended in the univer&s;e. But however &s;ingle acts of ju|&s;tice may be contrary, either to public or private intere&s;t, 'tis certain, that the whole plan or &s;cheme is highly conducive, or in|deed ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, both to the &s;upport of &s;ociety, and the well-being of every in|dividual. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the good from the ill. Property mu&s;t be &s;table, and mu&s;t be fix'd by general rules. Tho' in one in&s;tance the public be a &s;ufferer, this momentary ill is amply compen&s;ated by the &s;teady pro&s;ecution of the rule, and by the peace and order, which it e&s;tabli&s;hes in &s;o|ciety. And even every individual per&s;on mu&s;t find him&s;elf a gainer, on ballancing the account; &s;ince, without ju&s;tice, &s;ociety mu&s;t immediately di&s;&s;olve, and every one mu&s;t fall into that &s;avage and &s;olitary con|dition, which is infinitely wor&s;e than the wor&s;t &s;ituation that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppos'd in &s;ociety. When therefore men have had experience enough to ob&s;erve, that whatever
<PB N="73" REF="82">
may be the con&s;equence of any &s;ingle act of ju&s;tice, perform'd by a &s;ingle per&s;on, yet the whole &s;y&s;tem of actions, concurr'd in by the whole &s;ociety, is infinitely advantageous to the whole, and to every part; it is not long before ju&s;tice and property take place. Every member of &s;ociety is &s;en&s;ible of this intere&s;t: Every one expre&s;&s;es this &s;en&s;e to his fellows, along with the re&s;olution he has taken of &s;quaring his actions by it, on con|dition that others will do the &s;ame. No more is requi&s;ite to induce any one of them to perform an act of ju&s;tice, who has the fir&s;t opportunity. This becomes an example to others. And thus ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hes it|&s;elf by a kind of convention or agreement; that is, by a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t, &s;uppos'd to be common to all, and where every &s;ingle act is perform'd in expectation that others are to perform the like. Without &s;uch a con|vention, no one wou'd ever have dream'd, that there was &s;uch a virtue as ju&s;tice, or have been induc'd to conform his actions to it. Taking any &s;ingle act, my ju&s;tice may be pernicious in every re&s;pect; and 'tis only upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that others are to imitate my example, that I can be induc'd to em|brace that virtue; &s;ince nothing but this combination can render ju&s;tice advantageous,
<PB N="74" REF="83">
or afford me any motives to conform my &s;elf to its rules.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> que&s;tion we propos'd, <HI>viz. Why we annex the idea of vir|tue to ju&s;tice, and of vice to inju&s;tice.</HI> This que&s;tion will not detain us long after the principles, which we have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd. All we can &s;ay of it at pre&s;ent will be di&s;|patch'd in a few words: And for farther &s;a|tisfaction, the reader mu&s;t wait till we come to the <HI>third</HI> part of this book. The <HI>natural</HI> obligation to ju&s;tice, <HI>viz.</HI> intere&s;t, has been fully explain'd; but as to the <HI>moral</HI> obli|gation, or the &s;entiment of right and wrong, 'twill fir&s;t be requi&s;ite to examine the natu|ral virtues, before we can give a full and &s;a|tisfactory account of it.</P>
<P>AFTER men have found by experience, that their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and confin'd genero&s;ity, acting at their liberty, totally incapacitate them for &s;ociety; and at the &s;ame time have ob&s;erv'd, that &s;ociety is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;a|tisfaction of tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ions, they are na|turally induc'd to lay them&s;elves under the re&s;traint of &s;uch rules, as may render their commerce more &s;afe and commodious. To the impo&s;ition then, and ob&s;ervance of the&s;e rules, both in general, and in every particu|lar
<PB N="75" REF="84" MS="y">
in&s;tance, they are at fir&s;t induc'd only by a regard to intere&s;t; and this motive, on the fir&s;t formation of &s;ociety, is &s;ufficiently &s;trong and forcible. But when &s;ociety has become numerous, and has encreas'd to a tribe or nation, this intere&s;t is more remote; nor do men &s;o readily perceive, that di&s;or|der and confu&s;ion follow upon every breach of the&s;e rules, as in a more narrow and con|tracted &s;ociety. But tho' in our own actions we may frequently lo&s;e &s;ight of that in|tere&s;t, which we have in maintaining or|der, and may follow a le&s;&s;er and more pre|&s;ent intere&s;t, we never fail to ob&s;erve the prejudice we receive, either mediately or im|mediately, from the inju&s;tice of others; as not being in that ca&s;e either blinded by pa&s;|&s;ion, or bya&s;s'd by any contrary temptation. Nay when the inju&s;tice is &s;o di&s;tant from us, as no way to affect our intere&s;t, it &s;till di&s;|plea&s;es us; becau&s;e we con&s;ider it as preju|dicial to human &s;ociety, and pernicious to every one that approaches the per&s;on guilty of it. We partake of their unea&s;ine&s;s by <HI>&s;ympathy;</HI> and as every thing, which gives un|ea&s;ine&s;s in human actions, upon the general &s;urvey, is call'd Vice, and whatever produces &s;atisfaction, in the &s;ame manner, is denomi|nated Virtue; this is the rea&s;on why the &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil follows upon ju|&s;tice and inju&s;tice. And tho' this &s;en&s;e, in
<PB N="76" REF="85">
the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, be deriv'd only from con|templating the actions of others, yet we &s;ail not to extend it even to our own actions. The <HI>general rule</HI> reaches beyond tho&s;e in|&s;tances, from which it aro&s;e; while at the &s;ame time we naturally <HI>&s;ympathize</HI> with others in the &s;entiments they entertain of us. <HI>Thus &s;elf-intere&s;t is the original motive to the</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>of ju&s;tice: but a</HI> &s;ympathy <HI>with public intere&s;t is the &s;ource of the</HI> moral ap|probation, <HI>which attends that virtue.</HI></P>
<P>THO' this progre&s;s of the &s;entiments be <HI>natural,</HI> and even nece&s;&s;ary, 'tis certain, that it is here forwarded by the artifice of po|liticians, who, in order to govern men more ea&s;ily, and pre&s;erve peace in human &s;ociety, have endeavour'd to produce an e&s;teem for ju&s;tice, and an abhorrence of in|ju&s;tice. This, no doubt, mu&s;t have its ef|fect; but nothing can be more evident, than that the matter has been carry'd too far by certain writers on morals, who &s;eem to have employ'd their utmo&s;t efforts to extirpate all &s;en&s;e of virtue from among mankind. Any artifice of politicians may a&s;&s;i&s;t nature in the producing of tho&s;e &s;entiments, which &s;he &s;ugge&s;ts to us, and may even on &s;ome occa|&s;ions, produce alone an approbation or e&s;teem for any particular action; but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be the &s;ole cau&s;e of the dictinction we make betwixt vice and virtue.
<PB N="77" REF="86">
For if nature did not aid us in this parti|cular, 'twou'd be in vain for politicians to talk of <HI>honourable</HI> or <HI>di&s;honourable, prai&s;e|worthy</HI> or <HI>blameable.</HI> The&s;e words wou'd be perfectly unintelligible, and wou'd no more have any idea annex'd to them, than if they were of a tongue perfectly unknown to us. The utmo&s;t politicians can perform, is, to extend the natural &s;entiments beyond their original bounds; but &s;till nature mu&s;t furni&s;h the materials, and give us &s;ome no|tion of moral di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>AS publick prai&s;e and blame encrea&s;e our e&s;teem for ju&s;tice; &s;o private education and in&s;truction contribute to the &s;ame effect. For as parents ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that a man is the more u&s;eful, both to him&s;elf and others, the greater degree of probity and honour he is endow'd with; and that tho&s;e principles have greater force, when cu&s;tom and edu|cation a&s;&s;i&s;t intere&s;t and reflection: For the&s;e rea&s;ons they are induc'd to inculcate on their children, from their earlie&s;t infancy, the principles of probity, and teach them to re|gard the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rules, by which &s;ociety is maintain'd, as worthy and honour|able, and their violation as ba&s;e and infa|mous. By this means the &s;entiments of honour may take root in their tender minds,
<PB N="78" REF="87">
and acquire &s;uch firmne&s;s and &s;olidity, that they may fall little &s;hort of tho&s;e principles, which are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to our natures, and the mo&s;t deeply radicated in our inter|nal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>WHAT farther contributes to encrea&s;e their &s;olidity, is the intere&s;t of our reputation, after the opinion, <HI>that a merit or demerit at|tends ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice,</HI> is once firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd among mankind. There is nothing, which touches us more nearly than our re|putation, and nothing on which our reputa|tion more depends than our conduct, with relation to the property of others. For this rea&s;on, every one, who has any regard to his character, or who intends to live on good terms with mankind, mu&s;t fix an inviolable law to him&s;elf, never, by any temptation, to be induc'd to violate tho&s;e principles, which are e&s;&s;ential to a man of probity and honour.</P>
<P>I SHALL make only one ob&s;ervation be|fore I leave this &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> that tho' I a&s;|&s;ert, that in the <HI>&s;tate of nature,</HI> or that ima|ginary &s;tate, which preceded &s;ociety, there be neither ju&s;tice nor inju&s;tice, yet I a&s;&s;ert not, that it was allowable, in &s;uch a &s;tate, to violate the property of others. I only main|tain, that there was no &s;uch thing as pro|perty; and con&s;equently cou'd be no &s;uch
<PB N="79" REF="88">
thing as ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice. I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to make a &s;imilar reflection with re|gard to <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> when I come to treat of them; and I hope this reflection, when duly weigh'd, will &s;uffice to remove all odium from the foregoing opinions, with regard to ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the rules, which determine property.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the rule, concerning the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, be not only u&s;eful, but even ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to human &s;ociety, it can never &s;erve to any purpo&s;e, while it remains in &s;uch ge|neral terms. Some method mu&s;t be &s;hewn, by which we may di&s;tingui&s;h what particular goods are to be a&s;&s;ign'd to each particular per|&s;on, while the re&s;t of mankind are excluded from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment. Our next bu&s;ine&s;s, then, mu&s;t be to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons which modify this general rule, and fit it to the common u&s;e and practice of the world.</P>
<P>'TIS obvious, that tho&s;e rea&s;ons are not deriv'd from any utility or advantage, which
<PB N="80" REF="89">
either the <HI>particular</HI> per&s;on or the public may reap from his enjoyment of any <HI>parti|cular</HI> goods, beyond what wou'd re&s;ult from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them by any other per&s;on. 'Twere better, no doubt, that every one were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of what is mo&s;t &s;uitable to him, and proper for his u&s;e: But be&s;ides, that this relation of fitne&s;s may be common to &s;eve|ral at once, 'tis liable to &s;o many contro|ver&s;ies, and men are &s;o partial and pa&s;&s;ionate in judging of the&s;e controver&s;ies, that &s;uch a loo&s;e and uncertain rule wou'd be ab&s;o|lutely incompatible with the peace of hu|man &s;ociety. The convention concerning the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is enter'd into, in order to cut off all occa&s;ions of di&s;cord and contention; and this end wou'd never be at|tain'd, were we allow'd to apply this rule differently in every particular ca&s;e, according to every particular utility, which might be di&s;cover'd in &s;uch an application. Ju&s;tice, in her deci&s;ions, never regards the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of objects to particular per&s;ons, but conducts her&s;elf by more exten&s;ive views. Whether a man be generous, or a mi&s;er, he is equally well receiv'd by her, and obtains with the &s;ame facility a deci&s;ion in his fa|vours, even for what is entirely u&s;ele&s;s to him.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="90">
IT follows, therefore, that the general rule, <HI>that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;table,</HI> is not ap|ply'd by particular judgments, but by other general rules, which mu&s;t extend to the whole &s;ociety, and be inflexible either by &s;pite or favour. To illu&s;trate this, I propo&s;e the following in&s;tance. I fir&s;t con&s;ider men in their &s;avage and &s;olitary condition; and &s;uppo&s;e, that being &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;ery of that &s;tate, and fore&s;eeing the advantages that wou'd re&s;ult from &s;ociety, they &s;eek each other's company, and make an offer of mu|tual protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I al&s;o &s;up|po&s;e, that they are endow'd with &s;uch &s;aga|city as immediately to perceive, that the chief impediment to this project of &s;ociety and partner&s;hip lies in the avidity and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of their natural temper; to remedy which, they enter into a convention for the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and for mutual re&s;traint and forbearance. I am &s;en&s;ible, that this me|thod of proceeding is not altogether natural; but be&s;ides that I here only &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e reflections to be form'd at once, which in fact ari&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly and by degrees; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, 'tis very po&s;&s;ible, that &s;everal per&s;ons, being by different accidents &s;eparated from the &s;ocieties, to which they formerly be|long'd, may be oblig'd to form a new &s;ociety
<PB N="82" REF="91">
among them&s;elves; in which ca&s;e they are entirely in the &s;ituation above-mention'd.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, then, that their fir&s;t diffi|culty, in this
&s;ituation, after the general convention for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ociety, and for the con&s;tancy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is, how to &s;eparate their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;ign to each his particular portion, which he mu&s;t for the future inalterably enjoy. This diffi|culty will not detain them long; but it mu&s;t immediately occur to them, as the mo&s;t natural expedient, that every one continue to enjoy what he is at pre&s;ent ma&s;ter of, and that property or con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be con|join'd to the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Such is the effect of cu&s;tom, that it not only recon|ciles us to any thing we have long enjoy'd, but even gives us an affection for it, and makes us prefer it to other objects, which may be more valuable, but are le&s;s known to us.

and this is the rea&s;on, why they wou'd &s;o naturally agree in preferring it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>No que&s;tions in philo&s;ophy are more difficult, than when a number of cau&s;es pre&s;ent them&s;elves for the &s;ame phaeno|menon, to determine which is the principal and predominant.

<P>'Tis a quality, which <HI>(a) Book</HI> I. <HI>Part</HI> IV. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. I have already ob&s;erv'd in human nature, that when two objects appear in a clo&s;e relation to each other, the mind is apt to a&s;cribe to them any additional relation, in order to compleat the union; and this inclination is &s;o &s;trong, as often to make us run into errors (&s;uch as that of the conjunction of thought and matter) if we find that they can &s;erve to that purpo&s;e. Many of our impre&s;&s;ions are in|capable of place or local po&s;ition; and yet tho&s;e very im|pre&s;&s;ions we &s;uppo&s;e to have a local conjunction with the im|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;ight and touch, merely becau&s;e they are con|join'd by cau&s;ation, and are already united in the imagina|tion. Since, therefore, we can feign a new relation, and even an ab&s;urd one, in order to compleat any union, 'twill ea&s;ily be imagin'd, that if there be any relations, which de|pend on the mind, 'twill readily conjoin them to any pre|ceding relation, and unite, by a new bond, &s;uch objects as have already an union in the fancy. Thus for in&s;tance, we never fail, in our arrangement of bodies, to place tho&s;e which are <HI>re&s;embling</HI> in <HI>contiguity</HI> to each other, or at lea&s;t in <HI>cor|re&s;pondent</HI> points of view; becau&s;e we feel a &s;atisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of re&s;emblance, or the re&s;emblance of &s;ituation to that of qualities. And this is ea&s;ily accounted for from the known properties of human nature. When the mind is determin'd to join certain objects, but undetermin'd in its choice of the particular objects, it na|turally turns its eye to &s;uch as are related together. They are already united in the mind: They pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the &s;ame time to the conception; and in&s;tead of requiring any new rea&s;on for their conjunction, it wou'd require a very powerful rea&s;on to make us over-look this natural affinity. This we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to explain more fully afterwards, when we come to treat of <HI>beauty.</HI> In the mean time, we may content our&s;elves with ob&s;erving, that the &s;ame love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contributer to the formation of &s;ociety, and to the well-being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And as property forms a relation betwixt a per&s;on and an object, 'tis natural to found it on &s;ome preceding relation; and as pro|perty is nothing but a con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ecur'd by the laws of &s;ociety, 'tis natural to add it to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is a relation that re&s;embles it. For this al&s;o has its influence. If it be natural to conjoin all &s;orts of relations, 'tis more &s;o, to conjoin &s;uch relations as are re&s;embling, and are related together.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT we may ob&s;erve, that tho' the rule of the a&s;&s;ignment of property to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or be natural, and by that means u&s;e|ful,

yet its utility extends not beyond the fir&s;t formation of &s;ociety; nor wou'd any thing be more pernicious, than the con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of it; by which re&s;titution wou'd be excluded, and every inju&s;tice wou'd be authoriz'd and rewarded.

<P>THE po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all external goods is changeable and uncertain; which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable impediments to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ociety, and is the rea&s;on why, by univer&s;al agreement, expre&s;s or ta|cite, men re&s;train them&s;elves by what we now call the rules of ju&s;tice and equity. The mi&s;ery of the condition, which precedes this re&s;traint, is the cau&s;e why we &s;ubmit to that remedy as quickly as po&s;&s;ible; and this affords us an ea&s;y rea&s;on, why we an|nex the idea of property to the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, or to <HI>occupation.</HI> Men are unwilling to leave property in &s;u&s;pence, even for the &s;horte&s;t time, or open the lea&s;t door to vio|lence and di&s;order. To which we may add, that the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion always engages the attention mo&s;t; and did we neglect it, there wou'd be no colour of rea&s;on for a&s;&s;igning property to any &s;ucceeding po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Some philo&s;ophers account for the right of occupation, by &s;aying, that every one has a property in his own la|bour; and when he joins that labour to any thing, it gives him the property of the whole: But, 1.

<P>THERE remains nothing, but to deter|mine exactly, what is meant by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and this is not &s;o ea&s;y as may at fir&s;t &s;ight be imagin'd. We are &s;aid to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any thing, not only when we immediate|ly touch it, but al&s;o when we are &s;o &s;itua|ted with re&s;pect to it, as to have it in our power to u&s;e it; and may move, alter, or de&s;troy it, according to our pre&s;ent plea&s;ure or advantage. This relation, then, is a &s;pe|cies of cau&s;e and effect; and as property is nothing but a &s;table po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, deriv'd from the rules of ju&s;tice, or the conventions of men, 'tis to be con&s;ider'd as the &s;ame &s;pe|cies of relation.

Mark the preci&s;e limits of the one and the other, and &s;hew the &s;tandard, by which we may decide all di&s;|putes that may ari&s;e, and, as we find by ex|perience, frequently do ari&s;e upon this &s;ub|ject <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>If we &s;eek a &s;olution of the&s;e difficulties in rea&s;on and public intere&s;t, we never &s;hall find &s;atisfaction; and if we look for it in the imagination, 'tis evident, that the qualities, which operate upon that faculty, run &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly and gra|dually into each other, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give them any preci&s;e bounds or termination. The difficulties on this head mu&s;t encrea&s;e, when we con&s;ider, that our judgment alters very &s;en&s;ibly, according to the &s;ubject, and that the &s;ame power and proximity will be deem'd po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in one ca&s;e, which is not e&s;teem'd &s;uch in another. A per&s;on, who has hunted a hare to the la&s;t degree of wearine&s;s, wou'd look upon it as an inju&s;tice for another to ru&s;h in before him, and &s;eize his prey. But the &s;ame per&s;on, advancing to pluck an apple, that hangs within his reach, has no rea&s;on to com|plain, if another, more alert, pa&s;&s;es him, and takes po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. What is the rea&s;on of this difference, but that immo|bility, not being natural to the hare, but the effect of in|du&s;try, forms in that ca&s;e a &s;trong relation with the hunter, which is wanting in the other?</P>
<P>Here then it appears, that a certain and infallible power of enjoyment, without touch or &s;ome other &s;en&s;ible relation, of|ten produces not property: And I farther ob&s;erve, that a &s;en&s;ible relation, without any pre&s;ent power, is &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to give a title to any object. The &s;ight of a thing is &s;eldom a con&s;iderable relation, and is only regarded as &s;uch, when the object is hidden, or very ob&s;cure; in which ca&s;e we find, that the view alone conveys a property; according to that maxim, <HI>that even a whole continent belongs to the na|tion, which fir&s;t di&s;cover'd it.</HI> 'Tis however remarkable, that both in the ca&s;e of di&s;covery and that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t di&s;coverer and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mu&s;t join to the relation an in|tention of rendering him&s;elf proprietor, otherwi&s;e the rela|tion will not have its effect; and that becau&s;e the connexion in our fancy betwixt the property and the relation is not &s;o great, but that it requires to be help'd by &s;uch an intention.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee how perplex'd many que&s;tions may become concerning the acqui&s;ition of property by occupation; and the lea&s;t effort of thought may pre&s;ent us with in&s;tances, which are not &s;u&s;ceptible of any rea&s;onable deci&s;ion. If we prefer examples, which are real, to &s;uch as are feign'd, we may con&s;ider the following one, which is to be met with in almo&s;t every writer, that has trea|ted of the laws of nature. Two <HI>Grecian</HI> colonies, leaving their native country, in &s;earch of new &s;eats, were inform'd that a city near them was de&s;erted by its inhabitants. To know the truth of this report, they di&s;patch'd at once two me&s;&s;engers, one from each colony; who finding on their ap|proach, that their information was true, begun a race toge|ther with an intention to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, each of them for his countrymen. One of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers, finding that he was not an equal match for the other, launch'd his &s;pear at the gates of the city, and was &s;o fortunate as to fix it there before the arrival of his companion. This produc'd a di&s;pute betwixt the two colonies, which of them was the proprietor of the empty city; and this di&s;pute &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among philo&s;ophers. For my part I find the di&s;pute impo&s;|&s;ible to be decided, and that becau&s;e the whole que&s;tion hangs upon the fancy, which in this ca&s;e is not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any preci&s;e or determinate &s;tandard, upon which it can give &s;en|tence. To make this evident, let us con&s;ider, that if the&s;e two per&s;ons had been &s;imply members of the colonies, and not me&s;&s;engers or deputies, their actions wou'd not have been of any con&s;equence; &s;ince in that ca&s;e their relation to the colonies wou'd have been but feeble and imperfect. Add to this, that nothing determin'd them to run to the gates rather than the walls, or any other part of the city, but that the gates, being the mo&s;t obvious and remarkable part, &s;atisfy the fancy be&s;t in taking them for the whole; as we find by the poets, who frequently draw their images and metaphors from them. Be&s;ides we may con&s;ider, that the touch or contact of the one me&s;&s;enger is not properly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, no more than the piercing the gates with a &s;pear; but only forms a rela|tion; and there is a relation, in the other ca&s;e, equally ob|vious, tho' not, perhaps, of equal force. Which of the&s;e relations, then, conveys a right and property, or whether any of them be &s;ufficient for that effect, I leave to the deci&s;ion of &s;uch as are wi&s;er than my&s;elf.</P></NOTE>.</P>

nature of human &s;ociety admits not of any great accuracy; nor can we always remount to the fir&s;t origin of things, in order to de|termine their pre&s;ent condition. Any con|&s;iderable &s;pace of time &s;ets objects at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they &s;eem, in a manner, to lo&s;e their reality, and have as little influence on the mind, as if they never had been in being.

The &s;ame facts have not the &s;ame influence after &s;o long an interval of time. And this may be receiv'd as a convincing argument for our preceding doctrine with regard to property and ju&s;tice. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during a long tract of time conveys a title to any object. But as 'tis certain, that, however every thing be pro|duc'd in time, there is nothing real, that is produc'd by time; it follows, that property being produc'd by time, is not any thing real in the objects, but is the offspring of the &s;en|timents, on which alone time is found to have any influence <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is plainly a relation betwixt a per&s;on and an object; but is not &s;ufficient to counter-ballance the relation of fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s the former be long and uninterrup|ted: In which ca&s;e the relation is encreas'd on the &s;ide of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by the extent of time, and dimini&s;h'd on that of fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by the di&s;tance.

<P><PB N="91" REF="100">
WE acquire the property of objects by <HI>ac|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> when they are connected in an inti|mate manner with objects that are already our property, and at the &s;ame time are infe|rior to them.

<P>It has been ob&s;erv'd above, that the mind has a natural propen&s;ity to join relations, e&s;pecially re&s;embling ones, and finds a kind of fitne&s;s and uniformity in &s;uch an union. From this propen&s;ity are deriv'd the&s;e laws of nature, <HI>that upon the fir&s;t formation of &s;ociety, property always follows the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;</HI> and afterwards, <HI>that it ari&s;es from fir&s;t or from long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that relation is not confin'd merely to one degree; but that from an object, that is related to us, we acquire a relation to every other ob|ject, which is related to it, and &s;o on, till the thought lo&s;es the chain by too long a progre&s;s. However the relation may weaken by each remove, 'tis not immediately de&s;troy'd; but frequently connects two objects by means of an intermediate one, which is related to both. And this principle is of &s;uch force as to give ri&s;e to the right of <HI>acce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and cau&s;es us to acquire the property not only of &s;uch objects as we are immediately po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, but al&s;o of &s;uch as are clo&s;ely con|nected with them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a <HI>German,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to come into a room, where there are plac'd upon the table three bottles of wine, <HI>Rheni&s;h, Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Port;</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hou'd fall a quarrelling about the divi&s;ion of them; a per&s;on, who was cho&s;en for umpire, wou'd naturally, to &s;hew his impartiality, give every one the product of his own coun|try: And this from a principle, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, is the &s;ource of tho&s;e laws of nature, that a&s;cribe property to occupation, pre&s;cription and acce&s;&s;ion</P>
<P>In all the&s;e ca&s;es, and particularly that of acce&s;&s;ion, there is fir&s;t a <HI>natural</HI> union betwixt the idea of the per&s;on and that of the object, and afterwards a new and <HI>moral</HI> union produc'd by that right or property, which we a&s;cribe to the per&s;on. But here there occurs a difficulty, which merits our attention, and may afford us an opportunity of putting to tryal that &s;in|gular method of rea&s;oning, which has been employ'd on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. I have already ob&s;erv'd, that the imagina|tion pa&s;&s;es with greater facility from little to great, than from great to little, and that the tran&s;ition of ideas is always ea|&s;ier and &s;moother in the former ca&s;e than in the latter. Now as the right of acce&s;&s;ion ari&s;es from the ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas, by which related objects are connected together, it &s;hou'd na|turally be imagin'd, that the right of acce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t encrea&s;e in &s;trength, in proportion as the tran&s;ition of ideas is per|form'd with greater facility. It may, therefore, be thought, that when we have acquir'd the property of any &s;mall object, we &s;hall readily con&s;ider any great object related to it as an acce&s;&s;ion, and as belonging to the proprietor of the &s;mall one; &s;ince the tran&s;ition is in that ca&s;e very ea&s;y from the &s;mall ob|ject to the great one, and &s;hou'd connect them together in the clo&s;e&s;t manner. But in fact the ca&s;e is always found to be otherwi&s;e. The empire of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;eems to draw along with it the dominion of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> the i&s;le of <HI>Man,</HI> and the i&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> but the authority over tho&s;e le&s;&s;er i&s;lands does not naturally imply any title to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In &s;hort, a &s;mall object naturally follows a great one as its acce&s;&s;ion; but a great one is never &s;uppos'd to be|long to the proprietor of a &s;mall one related to it, merely on account of that property and relation. Yet in this latter ca&s;e the tran&s;ition of ideas is &s;moother from the proprietor to the &s;mall object, which is his property, and from the &s;mall ob|ject to the great one, than in the former ca&s;e from the pro|prietor to the great object, and from the great one to the &s;mall. It may therefore be thought, that the&s;e phaenomena are objections to the foregoing hypothe&s;is, <HI>that the a&s;cribing of property to acce&s;&s;ion is nothing but an affect of the relations of ideas, and of the &s;mooth tran&s;ition of the imagination.</HI></P>
<P>'Twill be ea&s;y to &s;olve this objection, if we con&s;ider the agility and un&s;teadine&s;s of the imagination, with the dif|ferent views, in which it is continually placing its objects. When we attribute to a per&s;on a property in two objects, we do not always pa&s;s from the per&s;on to one object, and from that to the other related to it. The objects being here to be con&s;ider'd as the property of the per&s;on, we are apt to join them together, and place them in the &s;ame light. Suppo&s;e, therefore, a great and a &s;mall object to be related together; if a per&s;on be &s;trongly related to the great object, he will likewi&s;e be &s;trongly related to both the objects, con&s;ider'd to|gether, becau&s;e he is related to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part. On the contrary, if he be only related to the &s;mall object, he will not be &s;trongly related to both, con&s;ider'd together, &s;ince his relation lies only with the mo&s;t trivial part, which is not apt to &s;trike us in any great degree, when we con&s;ider the whole. And this is the rea&s;on, why &s;mall objects be|come acce&s;&s;ions to great ones, and not great to &s;mall.</P>
<P>'Tis the general opinion of philo&s;ophers and civilians, that the &s;ea is incapable of becoming the property of any nation; and that becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, or form any &s;uch di&s;tinct relation with it, as may be the foundation of property. Where this rea&s;on cea&s;es, property immediately takes place. Thus the mo&s;t &s;trenuous advocates for the liberty of the &s;eas univer&s;ally allow, that friths and bays naturally belong as an acce&s;&s;ion to the proprietors of the &s;urrounding continent. The&s;e have properly no more bond or union with the land, than the <HI>pacific</HI> ocean wou'd have; but having an union in the fancy, and being at the &s;ame time <HI>inferior,</HI> they are of cour&s;e regarded as an acce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The property of rivers, by the laws of mo&s;t nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the pro|prietors of their banks, excepting &s;uch va&s;t rivers as the <HI>Rhine</HI> or the <HI>Danube,</HI> which &s;eem too large to the imagina|tion to follow as an acce&s;&s;ion the property of the neighbour|ing fields. Yet even the&s;e rivers are con&s;ider'd as the property of that nation, thro' who&s;e dominions they run; the idea of a nation being of a &s;uitable bulk to corre&s;pond with them, and bear them &s;uch a relation in the fancy.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ions, which are made to lands bordering upon rivers, follow the land, &s;ay the civilians, provided it be made by what they call <HI>alluvion,</HI> that is, in&s;en&s;ibly and impercepti|bly; which are circum&s;tances that mightily a&s;&s;i&s;t the imagina|tion in the conjunction. Where there is any con&s;iderable portion torn at once from one bank, and join'd to another, it becomes not his property, who&s;e land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees or plants have &s;pread their roots into both. Before that, the imagination does not &s;uf|ficiently join them.</P>
<P>There are other ca&s;es, which &s;omewhat re&s;emble this of acce&s;&s;ion, but which, at the bottom, are con&s;iderably differ|ent, and merit our attention. Of this kind is the conjunction of the properties of different per&s;ons, after &s;uch a manner as not to admit of <HI>&s;eparation.</HI> The que&s;tion is, to whom the united ma&s;s mu&s;t belong.</P>
<P>Where this conjunction is of &s;uch a nature as to admit of <HI>divi&s;ion,</HI> but not of <HI>&s;eparation,</HI> the deci&s;ion is natural and ea&s;y. The whole ma&s;s mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be common be|twixt the proprietors of the &s;everal parts, and afterwards mu&s;t be divided according to the proportions of the&s;e parts. But here I cannot forbear taking notice of a remarkable &s;ubtilty of the <HI>Roman</HI> law, in di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>com|mixtion.</HI> Confu&s;ion is an union of two bodies, &s;uch as differ|ent liquors, where the parts become entirely undi&s;tingui&s;ha|ble. Commixtion is the blending of two bodies, &s;uch as two bu&s;hels of corn, where the parts remain &s;eparate in an obvious and vi&s;ible manner. As in the latter ca&s;e the imagination di&s;|covers not &s;o entire an union as in the former, but is able to trace and pre&s;erve a di&s;tinct idea of the property of each; this is the rea&s;on, why the <HI>civil</HI> law, tho' it e&s;tabli&s;h'd an entire community in the ca&s;e of <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> and after that a propor|tional divi&s;ion, yet in the ca&s;e of <HI>commixtion,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es each of the proprietors to maintain a di&s;tinct right; however ne|ce&s;&s;ity may at la&s;t force them to &s;ubmit to the &s;ame divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Quod &s;i frumentum Titii frumento tuo mi&s;tum fuerit: &s;iqui|dem ex voluntate ve&s;tra, commune e&s;t: quia &s;ingula corpora, id e&s;t, &s;ingula grana, quae cuju&s;que propria fuerunt, ex con&s;en&s;u ve&s;tro communicata &s;unt.

<P>Where the properties of two per&s;ons are united after &s;uch a manner as neither to admit of <HI>divi&s;ion</HI> nor <HI>&s;eparation,</HI> as when one builds a hou&s;e on another's ground, in that ca&s;e, the whole mu&s;t belong to one of the proprietors: And here I a&s;&s;ert, that it naturally is conceiv'd to belong to the proprietor of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part. For however the compound object may have a relation to two different per&s;ons, and carry our view at once to both of them, yet as the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able part principally engages our attention, and by the &s;trict union draws the inferior along it; for this rea&s;on, the whole bears a relation to the proprietor of that part, and is regarded as his property. The only difficulty is, what we &s;hall be pleas'd to call the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part, and mo&s;t attractive to the imagination.</P>
<P>This quality depends on &s;everal different circum&s;tances, which have little connexion with each other. One part of a compound object may become more con&s;iderable than another, either becau&s;e it is more con&s;tant and durable; becau&s;e it is of greater value; becau&s;e it is more obvi|ous and remarkable; becau&s;e it is of greater extent; or be|cau&s;e its exi&s;tence is more &s;eparate and independent. 'Twill be ea&s;y to conceive, that, as the&s;e circum&s;tances may be con|join'd and oppos'd in all the different ways, and according to all the different degrees, which can be imagin'd, there will re&s;ult many ca&s;es, where the rea&s;ons on both &s;ides are &s;o equally ballanc'd, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to give any &s;ati&s;|factory deci&s;ion. Here then is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of muni|cipal laws, to fix what the principles of human nature have left undetermin'd,</P>
<P>The &s;uperficies yields to the &s;oil, &s;ays the civil law: The writing to the paper: The canvas to the picture. The&s;e de|ci&s;ions do not well agree together, and are a proof of the con|trariety of tho&s;e principles, from which they are deriv'd.</P>
<P>But of all the que&s;tions of this kind the mo&s;t curious is that, which for &s;o many ages divided the di&s;ciples of <HI>Proculus</HI> and <HI>Sabinus.</HI> Suppo&s;e a per&s;on &s;hou'd make a cup from the metal of another, or a &s;hip from his wood, and &s;uppo&s;e the proprietor of the metal or wood &s;hou'd demand his goods, the que&s;tion is, whether he acquires a title to the cup or &s;hip. <HI>Sabinus</HI> maintain'd the affirmative, and a&s;&s;erted that the &s;ub|&s;tance or matter is the foundation of all the qualities; that it is incorruptible and immortal, and therefore &s;uperior to the form, which is ca&s;ual and dependent. On the other hand, <HI>Proculus</HI> ob&s;erv'd, that the form is the mo&s;t obvious and re|markable part, and that from it bodies are denominated of this or that particular &s;pecies. To which he might have ad|ded, that the matter or &s;ub&s;tance is in mo&s;t bodies &s;o fluctua|ting and uncertain, that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible to trace it in all its changes. For my part, I know not from what principles &s;uch a controver&s;y can be certainly determin'd. I &s;hall there|fore content my &s;elf with ob&s;erving, that the deci&s;ion of <HI>Tre|bonian</HI> &s;eems to me pretty ingenious; that the cup belongs to the proprietor of the metal, becau&s;e it can be brought back to its fir&s;t form: But that the &s;hip belongs to the author of its form for a contrary rea&s;on. But however ingenious this rea|&s;on may &s;eem, it plainly depends upon the fancy, which by the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a reduction, finds a clo&s;er connexion and relation betwixt a cup and the proprietor of its metal, than betwixt a &s;hip and the proprietor of its wood, where the &s;ub&s;tance is more fix'd and unalterable.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>HOWEVER u&s;eful, or even nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion may be to human &s;ociety, 'tis attended with very con|&s;iderable inconveniences. The relation of fitne&s;s or &s;uitablene&s;s ought never to enter into con&s;ideration, in di&s;tributing the pro|perties of mankind; but we mu&s;t govern our&s;elves by rules, which are more general in their application, and more free from doubt and uncertainty. Of this kind is <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ociety; and afterwards <HI>occupation, pre|&s;cription, acce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HI> As the&s;e depend very much on chance, they mu&s;t frequently prove contradictory both to men's wants and de&s;ires; and per&s;ons and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions mu&s;t often be very ill adju&s;ted. This is a grand inconvenience, which calls for a remedy. To apply one directly, and allow every man to &s;eize by violence what he judges to be fit for him, wou'd de&s;troy &s;ociety; and therefore the rules of ju&s;tice
<PB N="99" REF="108">
&s;eek &s;ome medium betwixt a rigid &s;tability, and this changeable and uncertain adju&s;t|ment. But there is no medium better than that obvious one, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and pro|perty &s;hou'd always be &s;table, except when the proprietor con&s;ents to be&s;tow them on &s;ome other per&s;on. This rule can have no ill con&s;equence, in occa&s;ioning wars and di&s;&s;entions; &s;ince the proprietor's con&s;ent, who alone is concern'd, is taken along in the alienation: And it may &s;erve to many good purpo&s;es in adju&s;ting property to per|&s;ons. Different parts of the earth produce different commodities; and not only &s;o, but different men both are by nature fitted for different employments, and attain to greater perfection in any one, when they confine them&s;elves to it alone. All this requires a mutual exchange and commerce; for which rea&s;on the tran&s;lation of property by con&s;ent is founded on a law of nature, as well as its &s;tability without &s;uch a con&s;ent.</P>
<P>So far is determin'd by a plain utility and intere&s;t. But perhaps 'tis from more trivial rea&s;ons, that <HI>delivery,</HI> or a &s;en&s;ible tran&s;|ference of the object is commonly requir'd by civil laws, and al&s;o by the laws of na|ture, according to mo&s;t authors, as a requi|&s;ite circum&s;tance in the tran&s;lation of pro|perty.
<PB N="100" REF="109">
The property of an object, when taken for &s;omething real, without any re|ference to morality, or the &s;entiments of the mind, is a quality perfectly in&s;en&s;ible, and even inconceivable; nor can we form any di&s;tinct notion, either of its &s;tability or tran&s;lation. This imperfection of our ideas is le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt with regard to its &s;tability, as it engages le&s;s our attention, and is ea&s;ily pa&s;t over by the mind, without any &s;cru|pulous examination. But as the tran&s;lation of property from one per&s;on to another is a more remarkable event, the defect of our ideas becomes more &s;en&s;ible on that occa|&s;ion, and obliges us to turn our&s;elves on every &s;ide in &s;earch of &s;ome remedy. Now as nothing more enlivens any idea than a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, and a relation betwixt that impre&s;&s;ion and the idea; 'tis natural for us to &s;eek &s;ome fal&s;e light from this quarter. In order to aid the imagination in conceiving the transference of property, we take the &s;en&s;ible object, and actually transfer its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion to the per&s;on, on whom we wou'd be&s;tow the property. The &s;uppos'd re&s;em|blance of the actions, and the pre&s;ence of this &s;en&s;ible delivery, deceive the mind, and make it fancy, that it conceives the my&s;te|rious tran&s;ition of the property. And that

this explication of the matter is ju&s;t, appears hence, that men have invented a <HI>&s;ymbolical</HI> delivery, to &s;atisfy the fancy, where the real one is impracticable. Thus the giving the keys of a granary is under&s;tood to be the delivery of the corn contain'd in it: The giving of &s;tone and earth repre&s;ents the delivery of a mannor. This is a kind of &s;uper&s;titious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature, re&s;embling the <HI>Roman catho|lic</HI> &s;uper&s;titions in religion.

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of the obligation of promi&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the rule of morality, which enjoins the performance of promi&s;es, is not <HI>natural,</HI> will &s;ufficiently appear from
<PB N="102" REF="111">
the&s;e two propo&s;itions, which I proceed to prove, viz. <HI>that a promi&s;e wou'd not be in|telligible, before human conventions had e&s;tab|li&s;h'd it;</HI> and <HI>that even if it were intelli|gible, it wou'd not be attended with any moral obligation.</HI></P>
<P>I SAY, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that a promi&s;e is not intelli|gible naturally, nor antecedent to human con|ventions; and that a man, unacquainted with &s;ociety, could never enter into any engagements with another, even tho' they could perceive each other's thoughts by in|tuition. If promi&s;es be natural and intelli|gible, there mu&s;t be &s;ome act of the mind attending the&s;e words, <HI>I promi&s;e;</HI> and on this act of the mind mu&s;t the obligation de|pend. Let us, therefore, run over all the faculties of the &s;oul, and &s;ee which of them is exerted in our promi&s;es.</P>
<P>THE act of the mind, expre&s;t by a pro|mi&s;e, is not a <HI>re&s;olution</HI> to perform any thing: For that alone never impo&s;es any ob|ligation. Nor is it a <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of &s;uch a per|formance: For we may bind our&s;elves with|out &s;uch a de&s;ire, or even with an aver&s;ion, declar'd and avow'd. Neither is it the <HI>will|ing</HI> of that action, which we promi&s;e to perform: For a promi&s;e always regards &s;ome future time, and the will has an influence
<PB N="103" REF="112">
only on pre&s;ent actions. It follows, there|fore, that &s;ince the act of the mind, which enters into a promi&s;e, and produces its obli|gation, is neither the re&s;olving, de&s;iring, nor willing any particular performance, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the <HI>willing</HI> of that <HI>obligation,</HI> which ari&s;es from the promi&s;e. Nor is this only a conclu&s;ion of philo&s;ophy; but is en|tirely conformable to our common ways of thinking and of expre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves, when we &s;ay that we are bound by our own con|&s;ent, and that the obligation ari&s;es from our mere will and plea&s;ure. The only que&s;tion, then, is, whether there be not a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing this act of the mind, and &s;uch an ab&s;urdity as no man cou'd fall into, who&s;e ideas are not confounded, with prejudice and the fallacious u&s;e of language.</P>
<P>ALL morality depends upon our &s;enti|ments; and when any action, or quality of the mind, plea&s;es us <HI>after a certain man|ner,</HI> we &s;ay it is virtuous; and when the neglect, or non-performance of it, di&s;plea&s;es us <HI>after a like manner,</HI> we &s;ay that we lie under an obligation to perform it. A change of the obligation &s;uppo&s;es a change of the &s;entiment; and a creation of a new obliga|tion &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome new &s;entiment to ari&s;e. But 'tis certain we can naturally no more
<PB N="104" REF="113">
change our own &s;entiments, than the mo|tions of the heavens; nor by a &s;ingle act of our will, that is, by a promi&s;e, render any action agreeable or di&s;agreeable, moral or immoral; which, without that act, wou'd have produc'd contrary impre&s;&s;ions, or have been endow'd with different qualities. It wou'd be ab&s;urd, therefore, to will any new obligation, that is, any new &s;entiment of pain or plea&s;ure; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, that men cou'd naturally fall into &s;o gro&s;s an ab|&s;urdity. A promi&s;e, therefore, is <HI>naturally</HI> &s;omething altogether unintelligible, nor is there any act of the mind belonging to it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Were morality di&s;coverable by rea&s;on, and not by &s;enti|ment, 'twou'd be &s;till more evident, that promi&s;es cou'd make no alteration upon it. Morality is &s;uppos'd to con&s;i&s;t in relation. Every new impo&s;ition of morality, therefore, mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome new relation of objects; and con&s;e|quently the will cou'd not produce <HI>immediately</HI> any change in morals, but cou'd have that effect only by producing a change upon the objects. But as the moral obligation of a promi&s;e is the pure effect of the will, without the lea&s;t change in any part of the univer&s;e; it follows, that promi&s;es have no <HI>natural</HI> obligation.</P>
<P>Shou'd it be &s;aid, that this act of the will being in effect a new object, produces new relations and new duties; I wou'd an&s;wer, that this is a pure &s;ophi&s;m, which may be detected by a very moderate &s;hare of accuracy and exactne&s;s. To will a new obligation, is to will a new relation of objects; and therefore, if this new relation of objects were form'd by the volition it&s;elf, we &s;hou'd in effect will the volition; which is plainly ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. The will has here no object to which it cou'd tend; but mu&s;t return upon it&s;elf <HI>in in|finitum.</HI> The new obligation depends upon new relations. The new relations depend upon a new volition. The new volition has for object a new obligation, and con&s;equently new relations, and con&s;equently a new volition; which voli|tion again has in view a new obligation, relation and volition, without any termination. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, we cou'd ever will a new obligation; and con&s;equently 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible the will cou'd ever accompany a promi&s;e, or produce a new obligation of morality.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="114">
BUT, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> if there was any act of the mind belonging to it, it could not <HI>na|turally</HI> produce any obligation. This ap|pears evidently from the foregoing rea&s;oning. A promi&s;e creates a new obligation. A new obligation &s;uppo&s;es new &s;entiments to ari&s;e. The will never creates new &s;entiments. There could not naturally, therefore, ari&s;e any obligation from a promi&s;e, even &s;up|po&s;ing the mind could fall into the ab&s;ur|dity of willing that obligation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame truth may be prov'd &s;till more evidently by that rea&s;oning, which prov'd ju&s;tice in general to be an artificial virtue. No action can be requir'd of us as our duty, unle&s;s there be implanted in human nature &s;ome actuating pa&s;&s;ion or motive, capable of producing the action. This motive cannot be the &s;en&s;e of duty. A &s;en&s;e of duty &s;up|po&s;es an antecedent obligation: And where an action is not requir'd by any natural pa&s;&s;ion, it cannot be requir'd by any natural obligation; &s;ince it may be omitted without
<PB N="106" REF="115">
proving any defect or imperfection in the mind and temper, and con&s;equently without any vice. Now 'tis evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of promi&s;es, di&s;tinct from a &s;en&s;e of duty. If we thought, that promi&s;es had no moral obligation, we never &s;hou'd feel any incli|nation to ob&s;erve them. This is not the ca&s;e with the natural virtues. Tho' there was no obligation to relieve the mi&s;era|ble, our humanity wou'd lead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the omi&s;&s;ion ari&s;es from its being a proof, that we want the natural &s;entiments of hu|manity. A father knows it to be his duty to take care of his children: But he has al&s;o a natural inclination to it. And if no human creature had that inclination, no one cou'd lie under any &s;uch obligation. But as there is naturally no inclination to ob&s;erve promi&s;es, di&s;tinct from a &s;en&s;e of their ob|ligation; it follows, that fidelity is no natu|ral virtue, and that promi&s;es have no force, antecedent to human conventions.</P>
<P>IF any one di&s;&s;ent from this, he mu&s;t give a regular proof of the&s;e two propo|&s;itions, viz. <HI>that there is a peculiar act of the mind, annext to promi&s;es;</HI> and <HI>that con|&s;equent to this act of the mind, there ari&s;es an</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="116">
<HI>inclination to perform, di&s;tinct from a &s;en&s;e of duty.</HI> I pre&s;ume, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to prove either of the&s;e two points; and there|fore I venture to conclude, that promi&s;es are human inventions, founded on the nece&s;&s;ities and intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IN order to di&s;cover the&s;e nece&s;&s;ities and intere&s;ts, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;ame quali|ties of human nature, which we have al|ready found to give ri&s;e to the preceding laws of &s;ociety. Men being naturally &s;elfi&s;h, or endow'd only with a confin'd genero&s;ity, they are not ea&s;ily induc'd to perform any action for the intere&s;t of &s;trangers, except with a view to &s;ome reciprocal advantage, which they had no hope of obtaining but by &s;uch a performance. Now as it fre|quently happens, that the&s;e mutual per|formances cannot be fini&s;h'd at the &s;ame in&s;tant, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary, that one party be con|tented to remain in uncertainty, and depend upon the gratitude of the other for a re|turn of kindne&s;s. But &s;o much corruption is there among men, that, generally &s;peak|ing, this becomes but a &s;lender &s;ecurity; and as the benefactor is here &s;uppos'd to be&s;tow his favours with a view to &s;elf-intere&s;t, this both takes off from the obligation, and &s;ets an example of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is the true
<PB N="108" REF="117">
mother of ingratitude. Were we, therefore, to follow the natural cour&s;e of our pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, we &s;hou'd perform but few actions for the advantage of others, from di&s;intere&s;ted views; becau&s;e we are naturally very limited in our kindne&s;s and affection: And we &s;hou'd perform as few of that kind, out of a regard to intere&s;t; be|cau&s;e we cannot depend upon their grati|tude. Here then is the mutual commerce of good offices in a manner lo&s;t among man|kind, and every one reduc'd to his own &s;kill and indu&s;try for his well-being and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. The invention of the law of na|ture, concerning the <HI>&s;tability</HI> of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, has already render'd men tolerable to each other; that of the <HI>transference</HI> of property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by con&s;ent has begun to render them mutually advantageous: But &s;till the&s;e laws of nature, however &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, are not &s;ufficient to render them &s;o &s;ervice|able to each other, as by nature they are fitted to become. Tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be <HI>&s;table,</HI> men may often reap but &s;mall advantage from it, while they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a greater quantity of any &s;pecies of goods than they have occa&s;ion for, and at the &s;ame time &s;uffer by the want of others. The <HI>transfer|ence</HI> of property, which is the proper remedy
<PB N="109" REF="118">
for this inconvenience, cannot remedy it en|tirely; becau&s;e it can only take place with regard to &s;uch objects as are <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and <HI>in|dividual,</HI> but not to &s;uch as are <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> or <HI>general.</HI> One cannot transfer the property of a particular hou&s;e, twenty leagues di&s;tant; becau&s;e the con&s;ent cannot be attended with delivery, which is a requi&s;ite circum&s;tance. Neither can one transfer the property of ten bu&s;hels of corn, or five hog&s;heads of wine, by the mere expre&s;&s;ion and con&s;ent; be|cau&s;e the&s;e are only general terms, and have no direct relation to any particular heap of corn, or barrels of wine. Be&s;ides, the commerce of mankind is not confin'd to the barter of commodities, but may extend to &s;ervices and actions, which we may ex|change to our mutual intere&s;t and advantage. Your corn is ripe to-day; mine will be &s;o to-morrow. 'Tis profitable for us both, that I &s;hou'd labour with you to-day, and that you &s;hou'd aid me to-morrow. I have no kindne&s;s for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and &s;hould I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a return, I know I &s;hou'd be di&s;appointed, and that I &s;hou'd in vain de|pend upon your gratitude. Here then I
<PB N="110" REF="119">
leave you to labour alone: You treat me in the &s;ame manner. The &s;ea&s;ons change; and both of us lo&s;e our harve&s;ts for want of mutual confidence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>ALL this is the effect of the natural and inherent principles and pa&s;&s;ions of human nature; and as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and principles are inalterable, it may be thought, that our conduct, which depends on them, mu&s;t be &s;o too, and that 'twou'd be in vain, either for morali&s;ts or politicians, to tamper with us, or attempt to change the u&s;ual cour&s;e of our actions, with a view to public intere&s;t. And indeed, did the &s;ucce&s;s of their de&s;igns depend upon their &s;ucce&s;s in correcting the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ingratitude of men, they wou'd never make any progre&s;s, unle&s;s aided by omnipotence, which is alone able to new|mould the human mind, and change its character in &s;uch fundamental articles. All they can pretend to, is, to give a new direction to tho&s;e natural pa&s;&s;ions, and teach us that we can better &s;atisfy our appetites in an oblique and artificial manner, than by their headlong and impetuous motion. Hence I learn to do a &s;ervice to another, without bearing him any real kindne&s;s; be|cau&s;e I for&s;ee, that he will return my &s;er|vice, in expectation of another of the &s;ame
<PB N="111" REF="120">
kind, and in order to maintain the &s;ame corre&s;pondence of good offices with me or with others. And accordingly, after I have &s;erv'd him, and he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the advantage ari&s;ing from my action, he is in|duc'd to perform his part, as fore&s;eeing the con&s;equences of his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this &s;elf-intere&s;ted commerce of men begins to take place, and to predomi|nate in &s;ociety, it does not entirely aboli&s;h the more generous and noble intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip and good offices. I may &s;till do &s;ervices to &s;uch per&s;ons as I love, and am more particularly acquainted with, without any pro&s;pect of advantage; and they may make me a return in the &s;ame manner, with|out any view but that of recompen&s;ing my pa&s;t &s;ervices. In order, therefore, to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e two different &s;orts of commerce, the intere&s;ted and the di&s;intere&s;ted, there is a <HI>cer|tain form of words</HI> invented for the former, by which we bind our&s;elves to the per|formance of any action. This form of words con&s;titutes what we call a <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> which is the &s;anction of the intere&s;ted com|merce of mankind. When a man &s;ays <HI>he promi&s;es any thing,</HI> he in effect expre&s;&s;es a <HI>re&s;olution</HI> of performing it; and along with that, by making u&s;e of this <HI>form of words,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="121">
&s;ubjects him&s;elf to the penalty of never be|ing tru&s;ted again in ca&s;e of failure. A re&s;o|lution is the natural act of the mind, which promi&s;es expre&s;s: But were there no more than a re&s;olution in the ca&s;e, promi&s;es wou'd only declare our former motives, and wou'd not create any new motive or obligation. They are the conventions of men, which create a new motive, when experience has taught us, that human affairs wou'd be con|ducted much more for mutual advantage, were there certain <HI>&s;ymbols</HI> or <HI>&s;igns</HI> in&s;tituted, by which we might give each other &s;ecurity of our conduct in any particular incident. After the&s;e &s;igns are in&s;tituted, whoever u&s;es them is immediately bound by his intere&s;t to exe|cute his engagements, and mu&s;t never ex|pect to be tru&s;ted any more, if he refu&s;e to perform what he promis'd.</P>
<P>NOR is that knowledge, which is requi&s;ite to make mankind &s;en&s;ible of this intere&s;t in the <HI>in&s;titution</HI> and <HI>ob&s;ervance</HI> of promi&s;es, to be e&s;teem'd &s;uperior to the capacity of hu|man nature, however &s;avage and unculti|vated. There needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us perceive all the&s;e con&s;equences and advantages. The &s;horte&s;t experience of &s;ociety di&s;covers them to every mortal; and when each individual perceives
<PB N="113" REF="122">
the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t in all his fellows, he immediately performs his part of any contract, as being a&s;&s;ur'd, that they will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by con|cert, enter into a &s;cheme of actions, calcu|lated for common benefit, and agree to be true to their word; nor is there any thing requi&s;ite to form this concert or convention, but that every one have a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t in the faithful fulfilling of engagements, and expre&s;s that &s;en&s;e to other members of the &s;ociety. This immediately cau&s;es that in|tere&s;t to operate upon them; and intere&s;t is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> obligation to the performance of promi&s;es.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS a &s;entiment of morals concurs with intere&s;t, and becomes a new obligation upon mankind. This &s;entiment of morality, in the performance of promi&s;es, ari&s;es from the &s;ame principles as that in the ab&s;tinence from the property of others. <HI>Public intere&s;t, education,</HI> and <HI>the artifices of politicians,</HI> have the &s;ame effect in both ca&s;es. The difficulties, that occur to us, in &s;uppo&s;ing a moral obligation to attend promi&s;es, we either &s;urmount or elude. For in&s;tance; the expre&s;&s;ion of a re&s;olution is not commonly &s;uppos'd to be obligatory; and we cannot readily conceive how the
<PB N="114" REF="123">
making u&s;e of a certain form of words &s;hou'd be able to cau&s;e any material differ|ence. Here, therefore, we <HI>feign</HI> a new act of the mind, which we call the <HI>willing</HI> an obligation; and on this we &s;uppo&s;e the mo|rality to depend. But we have prov'd al|ready, that there is no &s;uch act of the mind, and con&s;equently that promi&s;es impo&s;e no natural obligation.</P>
<P>TO confirm this, we may &s;ubjoin &s;ome other reflections concerning that will, which is &s;uppos'd to enter into a promi&s;e, and to cau&s;e its obligation. 'Tis evident, that the will alone is never &s;uppos'd to cau&s;e the obli|gation, but mu&s;t be expre&s;s'd by words or &s;igns, in order to impo&s;e a type upon any man. The expre&s;&s;ion being once brought in as &s;ub&s;ervient to the will, &s;oon becomes the principal part of the promi&s;e; nor will a man be le&s;s bound by his word, tho' he &s;ecretly give a different direction to his in|tention, and with-hold him&s;elf both from a re&s;olution, and from willing an obligation. But tho' the expre&s;&s;ion makes on mo&s;t occa|&s;ions the whole of the promi&s;e, yet it does not always &s;o; and one, who &s;hou'd make u&s;e of any expre&s;&s;ion, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he u&s;es without any intention of binding him&s;elf, wou'd not
<PB N="115" REF="124">
certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he knows its meaning, yet if he u&s;es it in je&s;t only, and with &s;uch &s;igns as &s;hew evidently he has no &s;erious intention of binding him|&s;elf, he wou'd not lie under any obligation of performance; but 'tis nece&s;&s;ary, that the words be a perfect expre&s;&s;ion of the will, without any contrary &s;igns. Nay, even this we mu&s;t not carry &s;o far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickne&s;s of under|&s;tanding, we conjecture, from certain &s;igns, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expre&s;&s;ion or verbal promi&s;e, if we accept of it; but mu&s;t limit this conclu|&s;ion to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the &s;igns are of a different kind from tho&s;e of deceit. All the&s;e contradictions are ea&s;ily accounted for, if the obligation of promi&s;es be merely a human invention for the convenience of &s;ociety; but will never be explain'd, if it be &s;omething <HI>real</HI> and <HI>natural,</HI> ari&s;ing from any action of the mind or body.</P>
<P>I SHALL farther ob&s;erve, that &s;ince every new promi&s;e impo&s;es a new obligation of morality on the per&s;on who promi&s;es, and &s;ince this new obligation ari&s;es from his will; 'tis one of the mo&s;t my&s;terious and incom|prehen&s;ible operations that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagin'd, and may even be compar'd to
<PB N="116" REF="125">
<HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> or <HI>holy orders</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I mean &s;o far, as holy orders are &s;uppos'd to produce the <HI>indelible character.</HI> In other re&s;pects they are only a legal qualification.</NOTE>, where a certain form of words, along with a certain intention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even of a human crea|ture. But tho' the&s;e my&s;teries be &s;o far alike, 'tis very remarkable, that they differ widely in other particulars, and that this difference may be regarded as a &s;trong proof of the difference of their origins. As the obligation of promi&s;es is an invention for the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, 'tis warp'd into as many different forms as that intere&s;t requires, and even runs into direct contradictions, rather than lo&s;e &s;ight of its object. But as tho&s;e other mon&s;trous doctrines are mere prie&s;tly inventions, and have no public intere&s;t in view, they are le&s;s di&s;turb'd in their progre&s;s by new ob&s;tacles; and it mu&s;t be own'd, that, after the fir&s;t ab&s;urdity, they follow more directly the current of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e. Theologians clearly perceiv'd, that the external form of words, being mere &s;ound, require an intention to make them have any efficacy; and that this intention being once con&s;ider'd as a requi&s;ite circum|&s;tance, its ab&s;ence mu&s;t equally prevent the
<PB N="117" REF="126">
effect, whether avow'd or conceal'd, whether &s;incere or deceitful. Accordingly they have commonly determin'd, that the intention of the prie&s;t makes the &s;acrament, and that when he &s;ecretly withdraws his intention, he is highly criminal in him&s;elf; but &s;till de|&s;troys the bapti&s;m, or communion, or holy orders. The terrible con&s;equences of this doctrine were not able to hinder its taking place; as the inconvenience of a &s;imilar doctrine, with regard to promi&s;es, have pre|vented that doctrine from e&s;tabli&s;hing it&s;elf. Men are always more concern'd about the pre&s;ent life than the future; and are apt to think the &s;malle&s;t evil, which regards the former, more important than the greate&s;t, which regards the latter.</P>
<P>WE may draw the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, con|cerning the origin of promi&s;es, from the <HI>force,</HI> which is &s;uppos'd to invalidate all con|tracts, and to free us from their obligation. Such a principle is a proof, that promi&s;es have no natural obligation, and are mere artificial contrivances for the convenience and advantage of &s;ociety. If we con&s;ider aright of the matter, force is not e&s;&s;entially different from any other motive of hope or fear, which may induce us to engage our word, and lay our&s;elves under any obliga|tion.
<PB N="118" REF="127">
A man, dangerou&s;ly wounded, who promi&s;es a competent &s;um to a &s;urgeon to cure him, wou'd certainly be bound to per|formance; tho' the ca&s;e be not &s;o much dif|ferent from that of one, who promi&s;es a &s;um to a robber, as to produce &s;o great a differ|ence in our &s;entiments of morality, if the&s;e &s;entiments were not built entirely on public intere&s;t and convenience.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Some farther reflections concerning ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have now run over the three fun|damental laws of nature, <HI>that of the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of its transference by con&s;ent,</HI> and <HI>of the performance of pro|mi&s;es.</HI> 'Tis on the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e three laws, that the peace and &s;ecurity of human &s;ociety entirely depend; nor is there any po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;tabli&s;hing a good cor|re&s;pondence among men, where the&s;e are neglected. Society is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of men; and the&s;e are as nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of &s;ociety. What|ever re&s;traint they may impo&s;e on the pa&s;|&s;ions of men, they are the real offspring of
<PB N="119" REF="128">
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and are only a more artful and more refin'd way of &s;atisfying them. Nothing is more vigilant and inventive than our pa&s;&s;ions; and nothing is more obvious, than the convention for the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e rules. Nature has, therefore, tru&s;ted this affair entirely to the conduct of men, and has not plac'd in the mind any peculiar original principles, to determine us to a &s;et of actions, into which the other principles of our frame and con&s;titution were &s;ufficient to lead us. And to convince us the more fully of this truth, we may here &s;top a mo|ment, and from a review of the preceding rea&s;onings may draw &s;ome new arguments, to prove that tho&s;e laws, however nece&s;&s;ary, are entirely artificial, and of human inven|tion; and con&s;equently that ju&s;tice is an artificial, and not a natural virtue.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE fir&s;t argument I &s;hall make u&s;e of is deriv'd from the vulgar definition of ju&s;tice. Ju&s;tice is commonly defin'd to be <HI>a con&s;tant and perpetual will of giving every one his due.</HI> In this definition 'tis &s;uppos'd, that there are &s;uch things as right and pro|perty, independent of ju&s;tice, and antece|dent to it; and that they wou'd have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, tho' men had never dreamt of prac|ti&s;ing
<PB N="120" REF="129">
&s;uch a virtue. I have already ob|&s;erv'd, in a cur&s;ory manner, the fallacy of this opinion, and &s;hall here continue to open up a little more di&s;tinctly my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with ob&s;erving, that this quality, which we call <HI>property,</HI> is like many of the imaginary qualities of the <HI>peripatetic</HI> philo&s;ophy, and vani&s;hes upon a more accu|rate in&s;pection into the &s;ubject, when con|&s;ider'd a-part from our moral &s;entiments. 'Tis evident property does not con&s;i&s;t in any of the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the object. For the&s;e may continue invariably the &s;ame, while the property changes. Property, there|fore, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome relation of the object. But 'tis not in its relation with re|gard to other external and inanimate objects. For the&s;e may al&s;o continue invariably the &s;ame, while the property changes. This quality, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts in the relations of objects to intelligent and rational beings. But 'tis not the external and corporeal rela|tion, which forms the e&s;&s;ence of property. For that relation may be the &s;ame betwixt inanimate objects, or with regard to brute creatures; tho' in tho&s;e ca&s;es it forms no pro|perty. 'Tis, therefore, in &s;ome internal re|lation, that the property con&s;i&s;ts; that is,
<PB N="121" REF="130">
in &s;ome influence, which the external rela|tions of the object have on the mind and actions. Thus the external relation, which we call <HI>occupation</HI> or fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is not of it&s;elf imagin'd to be the property of the object, but only to cau&s;e its property. Now 'tis evident, this external relation cau&s;es no|thing in external objects, and has only an influence on the mind, by giving us a &s;en&s;e of duty in ab&s;taining from that object, and in re&s;toring it to the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The&s;e actions are properly what we call <HI>ju&s;tice;</HI> and con&s;equently 'tis on that virtue that the nature of property depends, and not the virtue on the property.</P>
<P>IF any one, therefore, wou'd a&s;&s;ert, that ju&s;tice is a natural virtue, and inju&s;tice a natural vice, he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert, that ab&s;tracting from the notions of <HI>property,</HI> and <HI>right</HI> and <HI>obligation,</HI> a certain conduct and train of actions, in certain external relations of objects, has naturally a moral beauty or deformity, and cau&s;es an original plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. Thus the re&s;toring a man's goods to him is con&s;ider'd as virtuous, not becau&s;e nature has annex'd a certain &s;entiment of plea|&s;ure to &s;uch a conduct, with regard to the property of others, but becau&s;e &s;he has an|nex'd that &s;entiment to &s;uch a conduct, with
<PB N="122" REF="131">
regard to tho&s;e external objects, of which others have had the fir&s;t or long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or which they have receiv'd by the con&s;ent of tho&s;e, who have had fir&s;t or long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. If nature has given us no &s;uch &s;en|timent, there is not, naturally, nor antece|dent to human conventions, any &s;uch thing as property. Now, tho' it &s;eems &s;ufficiently evident, in this dry and accurate con&s;ider|ation of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, that nature has annex'd no plea&s;ure or &s;entiment of appro|bation to &s;uch a conduct; yet that I may leave as little room for doubt as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few more arguments to con|firm my opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If nature had given us a plea&s;ure of this kind, it wou'd have been as evident and di&s;cernible as on every other occa&s;ion; nor &s;hou'd we have found any difficulty to per|ceive, that the con&s;ideration of &s;uch actions, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, gives a certain plea&s;ure and &s;entiment of approbation. We &s;hou'd not have been oblig'd to have recour&s;e to notions of property in the definition of ju|&s;tice, and at the &s;ame time make u&s;e of the notions of ju&s;tice in the definition of pro|perty. This deceitful method of rea&s;oning is a plain proof, that there are contain'd in the &s;ubject &s;ome ob&s;curities and difficulties,
<PB N="123" REF="132" MS="y">
which we are not able to &s;urmount, and which we de&s;ire to evade by this artifice.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho&s;e rules, by which pro|perties, rights, and obligations are deter|min'd, have in them no marks of a natural origin, but many of artifice and contrivance. They are too numerous to have proceeded from nature: They are changeable by hu|man laws: And have all of them a direct and evident tendency to public good, and the &s;upport of civil &s;ociety. This la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance is remarkable upon two accounts. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e, tho' the cau&s;e of the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the&s;e laws had been a <HI>regard</HI> for the public good, as much as the public good is their natural tendency, they wou'd &s;till have been artificial, as being purpo&s;ely contriv'd and directed to a certain end. <HI>Secondly,</HI> becau&s;e, if men had been endow'd with &s;uch a &s;trong regard for public good, they wou'd never have re&s;train'd them&s;elves by the&s;e rules; &s;o that the laws of ju&s;tice ari&s;e from natural principles in a manner &s;till more oblique and artificial. 'Tis &s;elf-love which is their real origin; and as the &s;elf|love of one per&s;on is naturally contrary to that of another, the&s;e &s;everal intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ions are oblig'd to adju&s;t them&s;elves after &s;uch a manner as to concur in &s;ome &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="124" REF="133">
of conduct and behaviour. This &s;y&s;tem, therefore, comprehending the intere&s;t of each individual, is of cour&s;e advantageous to the public; tho' it be not intended for that purpo&s;e by the inventors.</P>
<P N="2">II. IN the &s;econd place we may ob&s;erve, that all kinds of vice and virtue run in&s;en&s;i|bly into each other, and may approach by &s;uch imperceptible degrees as will make it very difficult, if not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, to determine when the one ends, and the other begins; and from this ob&s;ervation we may derive a new argument for the fore|going principle. For whatever may be the ca&s;e, with regard to all kinds of vice and virtue, 'tis certain, that rights, and obliga|tions, and property, admit of no &s;uch in&s;en|&s;ible gradation, but that a man either has a full and perfect property, or none at all; and is either entirely oblig'd to perform any action, or lies under no manner of obliga|tion. However civil laws may talk of a perfect <HI>dominion,</HI> and of an imperfect, 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that this ari&s;es from a fiction, which has no foundation in rea&s;on, and can never enter into our notions of natural ju|&s;tice and equity. A man that hires a hor&s;e, tho' but for a day, has as full a right to
<PB N="125" REF="134">
make u&s;e of it for that time, as he whom we call its proprietor has to make u&s;e of it any other day; and 'tis evident, that how|ever the u&s;e may be bounded in time or de|gree, the right it&s;elf is not &s;u&s;ceptible of any &s;uch gradation, but is ab&s;olute and entire, &s;o far as it extends. Accordingly we may ob|&s;erve, that this right both ari&s;es and peri&s;hes in an in&s;tant; and that a man entirely ac|quires the property of any object by occu|pation, or the con&s;ent of the proprietor; and lo&s;es it by his own con&s;ent; without any of that in&s;en&s;ible gradation, which is remarkable in other qualities and relations. Since, therefore, this is the ca&s;e with regard to property, and rights, and obligations, I a&s;k, how it &s;tands with regard to ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice? After whatever manner you an|&s;wer this que&s;tion, you run into inextricable difficulties. If you reply, that ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice admit of degree, and run in&s;en&s;ibly into each other, you expre&s;&s;ly contradict the foregoing po&s;ition, that obligation and pro|perty are not &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch a gradation. The&s;e depend entirely upon ju&s;tice and in|ju&s;tice, and follow them in all their varia|tions. Where the ju&s;tice is entire, the pro|perty is al&s;o entire: Where the ju&s;tice is im|perfect, the property mu&s;t al&s;o be imperfect.
<PB N="126" REF="135">
And <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if the property admit of no &s;uch variations, they mu&s;t al&s;o be incom|patible with ju&s;tice. If you a&s;&s;ent, there|fore, to this la&s;t propo&s;ition, and a&s;&s;ert, that ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice are not &s;u&s;ceptible of de|grees, you in effect a&s;&s;ert, that they are not <HI>naturally</HI> either vicious or virtuous; &s;ince vice and virtue, moral good and evil, and indeed all <HI>natural</HI> qualities, run in&s;en&s;ibly into each other, and are, on many occa|&s;ions, undi&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>
<P>AND here it may be worth while to ob|&s;erve, that tho' ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, and the general maxims of philo&s;ophy and law e&s;tab|li&s;h this po&s;ition, <HI>that property, and right, and obligation admit not of degrees,</HI> yet in our common and negligent way of thinking, we find great difficulty to entertain that opinion, and do even <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> embrace the contrary principle. An object mu&s;t either be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one per&s;on or another. An ac|tion mu&s;t either be perform'd or not. The nece&s;&s;ity there is of choo&s;ing one &s;ide in the&s;e dilemmas, and the impo&s;&s;ibility there often is of finding any ju&s;t medium, oblige us, when we reflect on the matter, to ac|knowledge, that all property and obligations are entire. But on the other hand, when we con&s;ider the origin of property and ob|ligation,
<PB N="127" REF="136">
and find that they depend on pub|lic utility, and &s;ometimes on the propen&s;ity of the imagination, which are &s;eldom entire on any &s;ide; we are naturally inclin'd to im|agine, that the&s;e moral relations admit of an in&s;en&s;ible gradation. Hence it is, that in references, where the con&s;ent of the parties leave the referees entire ma&s;ters of the &s;ub|ject, they commonly di&s;cover &s;o much equity and ju&s;tice on both &s;ides, as induces them to &s;trike a medium, and divide the difference betwixt the parties. Civil judges, who have not this liberty, but are oblig'd to give a deci&s;ive &s;entence on &s;ome one &s;ide, are often at a lo&s;s how to determine, and are nece&s;&s;i|tated to proceed on the mo&s;t frivolous rea|&s;ons in the world. Half rights and obliga|tions, which &s;eem &s;o natural in common life, are perfect ab&s;urdities in their tribunal; for which rea&s;on they are often oblig'd to take half arguments for whole ones, in or|der to terminate the affair one way or other.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third argument of this kind I &s;hall make u&s;e of may be explain'd thus. If we con&s;ider the ordinary cour&s;e of human actions, we &s;hall find, that the mind re|&s;trains not it&s;elf by any general and univer&s;al rules; but acts on mo&s;t occa&s;ions as it is
<PB N="128" REF="137">
determin'd by its pre&s;ent motives and incli|nation. As each action is a particular indi|vidual event, it mu&s;t proceed from parti|cular principles, and from our immediate &s;ituation within our&s;elves, and with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the univer&s;e. If on &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions we extend our motives beyond tho&s;e very circum&s;tances, which gave ri&s;e to them, and form &s;omething like <HI>general rules</HI> for our conduct, 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e rules are not perfectly inflexible, but allow of many exceptions. Since, therefore, this is the ordinary cour&s;e of human actions, we may conclude, that the laws of ju&s;tice, be|ing univer&s;al and perfectly inflexible, can never be deriv'd from nature, nor be the immediate offspring of any natural motive or inclination. No action can be either morally good or evil, unle&s;s there be &s;ome natural pa&s;&s;ion or motive to impel us to it, or deter us from it; and 'tis evident, that the morality mu&s;t be &s;u&s;ceptible of all the &s;ame variations, which are natural to the pa&s;&s;ion. Here are two per&s;ons, who di&s;|pute for an e&s;tate; of whom one is rich, a fool, and a batchelor; the other poor, a man of &s;en&s;e, and has a numerous family: The fir&s;t is my enemy; the &s;econd my friend. Whether I be actuated in this affair
<PB N="129" REF="138">
by a view to public or private intere&s;t, by friend&s;hip or enmity, I mu&s;t be induc'd to do my utmo&s;t to procure the e&s;tate to the latter. Nor wou'd any con&s;ideration of the right and property of the per&s;ons be able to re&s;train me, were I actuated only by natural motives, without any combination or con|vention with others. For as all property de|pends on morality; and as all morality de|pends on the ordinary cour&s;e of our pa&s;&s;ions and actions; and as the&s;e again are only directed by particular motives; 'tis evident, &s;uch a partial conduct mu&s;t be &s;uitable to the &s;tricte&s;t morality, and cou'd never be a violation of property. Were men, there|fore, to take the liberty of acting with re|gard to the laws of &s;ociety, as they do in every other affair, they wou'd conduct them|&s;elves, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, by particular judg|ments, and wou'd take into con&s;ideration the characters and circum&s;tances of the per|&s;ons, as well as the general nature of the que&s;tion. But 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that this wou'd produce an infinite confu&s;ion in hu|man &s;ociety, and that the avidity and par|tiality of men wou'd quickly bring di&s;order into the world, if not re&s;train'd by &s;ome general and inflexible principles. 'Twas, therefore, with a view to this inconvenience,
<PB N="130" REF="139" MS="y">
that men have e&s;tabli&s;h'd tho&s;e principles, and have agreed to re&s;train them&s;elves by general rules, which are unchangeable by &s;pite and favour, and by particular views of private or public intere&s;t. The&s;e rules, then, are artificially invented for a certain purpo&s;e, and are contrary to the common principles of human nature, which accommodate them|&s;elves to circum&s;tances, and have no &s;tated invariable method of operation.</P>
<P>NOR do I perceive how I can ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken in this matter. I &s;ee evidently, that when any man impo&s;es on him&s;elf general inflexible rules in his conduct with others, he con&s;iders certain objects as their property, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;acred and inviolable. But no propo&s;ition can be more evident, than that property is perfectly unintelligible without fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice; and that the&s;e virtues and vices are as unin|telligible, unle&s;s we have motives, inde|pendent of the morality, to impel us to ju&s;t actions, and deter us from unju&s;t ones. Let tho&s;e motives, therefore, be what they will, they mu&s;t accommodate them&s;elves to cir|cum&s;tances, and mu&s;t admit of all the vari|ations, which human affairs, in their in|ce&s;&s;ant revolutions, are &s;u&s;ceptible of. They are con&s;equently a very improper foundation
<PB N="131" REF="140" MS="y">
for &s;uch rigid inflexible rules as the laws of nature; and 'tis evident the&s;e laws can only be deriv'd from human conventions, when men have perceiv'd the di&s;orders that re&s;ult from following their natural and variable principles.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, then, we are to con|&s;ider this di&s;tinction betwixt ju&s;tice and in|ju&s;tice, as having two different foundations, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> when men ob&s;erve, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to live in &s;ociety without re&s;training them&s;elves by certain rules; and that of <HI>morality,</HI> when this intere&s;t is once ob&s;erv'd, and men receive a plea&s;ure from the view of &s;uch actions as tend to the peace of &s;ociety, and an unea&s;ine&s;s from &s;uch as are contrary to it. 'Tis the voluntary con|vention and artifice of men, which makes the fir&s;t intere&s;t take place; and therefore tho&s;e laws of ju&s;tice are &s;o far to be con|&s;ider'd as <HI>artificial.</HI> After that intere&s;t is once e&s;tabli&s;h'd and acknowledg'd, the &s;en&s;e of morality in the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e rules follows <HI>naturally,</HI> and of it&s;elf; tho' 'tis cer|tain, that it is al&s;o augmented by a new <HI>artifice,</HI> and that the public in&s;tructions of politicians, and the private education of pa|rents, contribute to the giving a &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="132" REF="141">
honour and duty in the &s;trict regulation of our actions with regard to the properties of others.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Of the origin of government.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that men are, in a great mea&s;ure, govern'd by intere&s;t, and that even when they extend their concern beyond them&s;elves, 'tis not to any great di&s;tance; nor is it u&s;ual for them, in common life, to look farther than their neare&s;t friends and acquaintance. 'Tis no le&s;s certain, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for men to con&s;ult their intere&s;t in &s;o effectual a manner, as by an univer&s;al and inflexible ob&s;ervance of the rules of ju&s;tice, by which alone they can pre&s;erve &s;ociety, and keep them&s;elves from falling into that wretched and &s;avage condition, which is commonly repre&s;ented as the <HI>&s;tate of nature.</HI> And as this intere&s;t, which all men have in the upholding of &s;ociety, and the ob&s;ervation of the rules of ju&s;tice, is great, &s;o is it palpable and evident, even to the mo&s;t rude and uncultivated of human race; and 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="133" REF="142">
any one, who has had experience of &s;ociety, to be mi&s;taken in this particular. Since, therefore, men are &s;o &s;incerely attach'd to their intere&s;t, and their intere&s;t is &s;o much concern'd in the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice, and this intere&s;t is &s;o certain and avow'd; it may be a&s;k'd, how any di&s;order can ever ari&s;e in &s;ociety, and what principle there is in human nature &s;o <HI>powerful</HI> as to overcome &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;o <HI>violent</HI> as to ob|&s;cure &s;o clear a knowledge?</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd, in treating of the pa&s;&s;ions, that men are mightily govern'd by the imagination, and proportion their affec|tions more to the light, under which any object appears to them, than to its real and intrin&s;ic value. What &s;trikes upon them with a &s;trong and lively idea commonly pre|vails above what lies in a more ob&s;cure light; and it mu&s;t be a great &s;uperiority of value, that is able to compen&s;ate this advantage. Now as every thing, that is contiguous to us, either in &s;pace or time, &s;trikes upon us with &s;uch an idea, it has a proportional effect on the will and pa&s;&s;ions, and commonly operates with more force than any object, that lies in a more di&s;tant and ob&s;cure light. Tho' we may be fully convinc'd, that the latter object excels the former, we are not
<PB N="134" REF="143">
able to regulate our actions by this judg|ment; but yield to the &s;ollicitations of our pa&s;&s;ions, which always plead in favour of whatever is near and contiguous.</P>
<P>THIS is the rea&s;on why men &s;o often act in contradiction to their known intere&s;t; and in particular why they prefer any trivial ad|vantage, that is pre&s;ent, to the maintenance of order in &s;ociety, which &s;o much depends on the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice. The con|&s;equences of every breach of equity &s;eem to lie very remote, and are not able to counter|ballance any immediate advantage, that may be reap'd from it. They are, however, never the le&s;s real for being remote; and as all men are, in &s;ome degree, &s;ubject to the &s;ame weakne&s;s, it nece&s;&s;arily happens, that the violations of equity mu&s;t become very fre|quent in &s;ociety, and the commerce of men, by that means, be render'd very dangerous and uncertain. You have the &s;ame pro|pen&s;ion, that I have, in favour of what is contiguous above what is remote. You are, therefore, naturally carried to commit acts of inju&s;tice as well as me. Your example both pu&s;hes me forward in this way by imi|tation, and al&s;o affords me a new rea&s;on for any breach of equity, by &s;hewing me, that I &s;hould be the cully of my integrity, if I
<PB N="135" REF="144" MS="y">
alone &s;hou'd impo&s;e on my&s;elf a &s;evere re|&s;traint amid&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of others.</P>
<P>THIS quality, therefore, of human na|ture, not only is very dangerous to &s;ociety, but al&s;o &s;eems, on a cur&s;ory view, to be in|capable of any remedy. The remedy can only come from the con&s;ent of men; and if men be incapable of them&s;elves to prefer remote to contiguous, they will never con|&s;ent to any thing, which wou'd oblige them to &s;uch a choice, and contradict, in &s;o &s;en|&s;ible a manner, their natural principles and propen&s;ities. Whoever chu&s;es the means, chu&s;es al&s;o the end; and if it be impo&s;&s;ible for us to prefer what is remote, 'tis equally impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ubmit to any nece&s;&s;ity, which wou'd oblige us to &s;uch a method of acting.</P>
<P>BUT here 'tis ob&s;ervable, that this infir|mity of human nature becomes a remedy to it&s;elf, and that we provide again&s;t our neg|ligence about remote objects, merely be|cau&s;e we are naturally inclin'd to that negli|gence. When we con&s;ider any objects at a di&s;tance, all their minute di&s;tinctions vani&s;h, and we always give the preference to what|ever is in it&s;elf preferable, without con&s;ider|ing its &s;ituation and circum&s;tances. This gives ri&s;e to what in an improper &s;en&s;e we
<PB N="136" REF="145">
call <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is a principle, that is of|ten contradictory to tho&s;e propen&s;ities that di&s;play them&s;elves upon the approach of the object. In reflecting on any action, which I am to perform a twelve-month hence, I al|ways re&s;olve to prefer the greater good, whether at that time it will be more conti|guous or remote; nor does any difference in that particular make a difference in my pre&s;ent intentions and re&s;olutions. My di|&s;tance from the final determination makes all tho&s;e minute differences vani&s;h, nor am I affected by any thing, but the general and more di&s;cernable qualities of good and evil. But on my nearer approach, tho&s;e circum|&s;tances, which I at fir&s;t over-look'd, begin to appear, and have an influence on my conduct and affections. A new inclination to the pre&s;ent good &s;prings up, and makes it difficult for me to adhere inflexibly to my fir&s;t purpo&s;e and re&s;olution. This natural infirmity I may very much regret, and I may endeavour, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to free my &s;elf from it. I may have recour&s;e to &s;tudy and reflection within my&s;elf; to the advice of friends; to frequent meditation, and re|peated re&s;olution: And having experienc'd how ineffectual all the&s;e are, I may embrace with plea&s;ure any other expedient, by which
<PB N="137" REF="146">
I may impo&s;e a re&s;traint upon my&s;elf, and guard again&s;t this weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE only difficulty, therefore, is to find out this expedient, by which men cure their natural weakne&s;s, and lay them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving the laws of ju&s;tice and equity, notwith&s;tanding their violent propen&s;ion to prefer contiguous to remote. 'Tis evident &s;uch a remedy can never be ef|fectual without correcting this propen&s;ity; and as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to change or correct any thing material in our nature, the utmo&s;t we can do is to change our circum&s;tances and &s;ituation, and render the ob&s;ervance of the laws of ju&s;tice our neare&s;t intere&s;t, and their violation our mo&s;t remote. But this being impracticable with re&s;pect to all man|kind, it can only take place with re&s;pect to a few, whom we thus immediately intere&s;t in the execution of ju&s;tice. The&s;e are the per&s;ons, whom we call civil magi&s;trates, kings and their mini&s;ters, our governors and rulers, who being indifferent per&s;ons to the greate&s;t part of the &s;tate, have no intere&s;t, or but a remote one, in any act of inju&s;tice; and be|ing &s;atisfied with their pre&s;ent condition, and with their part in &s;ociety, have an im|mediate intere&s;t in every execution of ju&s;tice, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the upholding of
<PB N="138" REF="147" MS="y">
&s;ociety. Here then is the origin of civil go|vernment and &s;ociety. Men are not able radically to cure, either in them&s;elves or o|thers, that narrowne&s;s of &s;oul, which makes them prefer the pre&s;ent to the remote. They cannot change their natures. All they can do is to change their &s;ituation, and render the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice the immediate in|tere&s;t of &s;ome particular per&s;ons, and its vio|lation their more remote. The&s;e per&s;ons, then, are not only induc'd to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules in their own conduct, but al&s;o to con|&s;train others to a like regularity, and inforce the dictates of equity thro' the whole &s;ociety. And if it be nece&s;&s;ary, they may al&s;o inte|re&s;t others more immediately in the execu|tion of ju&s;tice, and create a number of offi|cers, civil and military, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their government.</P>
<P>BUT this execution of ju&s;tice, tho' the principal, is not the only advantage of go|vernment. As the violent pa&s;&s;ions hinders men from &s;eeing di&s;tinctly the intere&s;t they have in an equitable behaviour towards others; &s;o it hinders them from &s;eeing that equity it&s;elf, and gives them a remarkable partiality in their own favours. This incon|venience is corrected in the &s;ame manner as that above-mention'd. The &s;ame per&s;ons,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
who execute the laws of ju&s;tice, will al&s;o decide all controver&s;ies concerning them; and being indifferent to the greate&s;t part of the &s;ociety, will decide them more equitably than every one wou'd in his own ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BY means of the&s;e two advantages, in the <HI>execution</HI> and <HI>deci&s;ion</HI> of ju&s;tice, men acquire a &s;ecurity again&s;t each others weakne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, as well as again&s;t their own, and under the &s;helter of their governors, begin to ta&s;te at ea&s;e the &s;weets of &s;ociety and mu|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But government extends farther its beneficial influence; and not con|tented to protect men in tho&s;e conventions they make for their mutual intere&s;t, it often obliges them to make &s;uch conventions, and forces them to &s;eek their own advantage, by a concurrence in &s;ome common end or purpo&s;e. There is no quality in human nature, which cau&s;es more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is pre|&s;ent to the di&s;tant and remote, and makes us de&s;ire objects more according to their &s;ituation than their intrin&s;ic value. Two neighbours may agree to drain a meadow, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common; becau&s;e 'tis ea&s;y for them to know each others mind; and each mu&s;t perceive, that the immediate con&s;e|quence of his failing in his part, is, the
<PB N="140" REF="149" MS="y">
abandoning the whole project. But 'tis very difficult, and indeed impo&s;&s;ible, that a thou|&s;and per&s;ons &s;hou'd agree in any &s;uch action; it being difficult for them to concert &s;o com|plicated a de&s;ign, and &s;till more difficult for them to execute it; while each &s;eeks a pre|text to free him&s;elf of the trouble and ex|pence, and wou'd lay the whole burden on others. Political &s;ociety ea&s;ily remedies both the&s;e inconveniences. Magi&s;trates find an immediate intere&s;t in the intere&s;t of any con|&s;iderable part of their &s;ubjects. They need con&s;ult no body but them&s;elves to form any &s;cheme for the promoting of that intere&s;t. And as the failure of any one piece in the execution is connected, tho' not immediately, with the failure of the whole, they prevent that failure, becau&s;e they find no intere&s;t in it, either immediate or remote. Thus bridges are built; harbours open'd; ramparts rais'd; canals form'd; fleets equip'd; and armies di&s;ciplin'd; every where, by the care of government, which, tho' compos'd of men &s;ubject to all human infirmities, becomes, by one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubtle inven|tions imaginable, a compo&s;ition, which is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, exempted from all the&s;e infirmities.</P>

<P>THOUGH government be an inven|tion very advantageous, and even in &s;ome circum&s;tances ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to mankind; it is not nece&s;&s;ary in all circum|&s;tances, nor is it impo&s;&s;ible for men to pre|&s;erve &s;ociety for &s;ome time, without having recour&s;e to &s;uch an invention. Men, 'tis true, are always much inclin'd to prefer pre|&s;ent intere&s;t to di&s;tant and remote; nor is it ea&s;y for them to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of any advantage, that they may immediately enjoy, in apprehen&s;ion of an evil, that lies at a di&s;tance from them: But &s;till this weakne&s;s is le&s;s con&s;picuous, where the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the plea&s;ures of life are few, and of little value, as they always are in the infancy of &s;ociety. An <HI>Indian</HI> is but little tempted to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s another of his hut, or to &s;teal his bow, as being already provided of the &s;ame advantages; and as to any &s;uperior fortune, which may attend one above another in hunting and fi&s;hing, 'tis only ca&s;ual and temporary, and will have but &s;mall tendency
<PB N="142" REF="151" MS="y">
to di&s;turb &s;ociety. And &s;o far am I from thinking with &s;ome philo&s;ophers, that men are utterly incapable of &s;ociety without government, that I a&s;&s;ert the fir&s;t rudiments of government to ari&s;e from quarrels, not among men of the &s;ame &s;ociety, but among tho&s;e of different &s;ocieties. A le&s;s degree of riches will &s;uffice to this latter effect, than is requi&s;ite for the former. Men fear nothing from public war and violence but the re&s;i&s;t|ance they meet with, which, becau&s;e they &s;hare it in common, &s;eems le&s;s terrible; and becau&s;e it comes from &s;trangers, &s;eems le&s;s pernicious in its con&s;equences, than when they are expos'd &s;ingly again&s;t one who&s;e commerce is advantageous to them, and without who&s;e &s;ociety 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Now foreign war to a &s;ociety without government nece&s;&s;arily produces civil war. Throw any con&s;iderable goods among men, they in&s;tantly fall a quarrelling, while each &s;trives to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what plea&s;es him, without regard to the con&s;equences. In a foreign war the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all goods, life and limbs, are at &s;take; and as every one &s;huns dangerous ports, &s;eizes the be&s;t arms, &s;eeks excu&s;e for the &s;lighte&s;t wounds, the laws, which may be well enough ob&s;erv'd, while men were calm, can

now no longer take place, when they are in &s;uch commotion.</P>
<P>THIS we find verified in the <HI>American</HI> tribes, where men live in concord and amity among them&s;elves without any e&s;tab|li&s;h'd government; and never pay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when their captain enjoys a &s;hadow of authority, which he lo&s;es after their return from the field, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace with the neighbouring tribes. This authority, however, in&s;tructs them in the advantages of government, and teaches them to have recour&s;e to it, when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous inventions, their riches and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions have become &s;o con&s;iderable as to make them forget, on every emergence, the intere&s;t they have in the pre&s;ervation of peace and ju&s;tice. Hence we may give a plau&s;ible rea&s;on, among others, why all governments are at fir&s;t monarchical, without any mixture and variety; and why republics ari&s;e only from the abu&s;es of monarchy and de&s;potic power. Camps are the true mothers of cities; and as war cannot be admini&s;tred, by rea&s;on of the &s;uddenne&s;s of every exi|gency, without &s;ome authority in a &s;ingle per&s;on, the &s;ame kind of authority naturally
<PB N="144" REF="153">
takes place in that civil government, which &s;ucceeds the military. And this rea&s;on I take to be more natural, than the common one deriv'd from patriarchal government, or the authority of a father, which is &s;aid fir&s;t to take place in one family, and to accu&s;tom the members of it to the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on. The &s;tate of &s;ociety without government is one of the mo&s;t natural &s;tates of men, and mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t with the con|junction of many families, and long after the fir&s;t generation. Nothing but an en|crea&s;e of riches and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions cou'd oblige men to quit it; and &s;o barbarous and unin|&s;tructed are all &s;ocieties on their fir&s;t forma|tion, that many years mu&s;t elap&s;e before the&s;e can encrea&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as to di&s;turb men in the enjoyment of peace and concord.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it be po&s;&s;ible for men to main|tain a &s;mall uncultivated &s;ociety without government, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hou'd main|tain a &s;ociety of any kind without ju&s;tice, and the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e three funda|mental laws concerning the &s;tability of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, its tran&s;lation by con&s;ent, and the performance of promi&s;es. The&s;e are, there|fore, antecedent to government, and are &s;uppos'd to impo&s;e an obligation before the
<PB N="145" REF="154">
duty of allegiance to civil magi&s;trates has once been thought of. Nay, I &s;hall go far|ther, and a&s;&s;ert, that government, <HI>upon its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> wou'd naturally be &s;up|pos'd to derive its obligation from tho&s;e laws of nature, and, in particular, from that con|cerning the performance of promi&s;es. When men have once perceiv'd the nece&s;&s;ity of government to maintain peace, and execute ju&s;tice, they wou'd naturally a&s;&s;emble to|gether, wou'd chu&s;e magi&s;trates, determine their power, and <HI>promi&s;e</HI> them obedience. As a promi&s;e is &s;uppos'd to be a bond or &s;ecurity already in u&s;e, and attended with a moral obligation, 'tis to be con&s;ider'd as the original &s;anction of government, and as the &s;ource of the fir&s;t obligation to obedience. This rea&s;oning appears &s;o natural, that it has become the foundation of our fa&s;hionable &s;y&s;tem of politics, and is in a manner the creed of a party among&s;t us, who pride them&s;elves, with rea&s;on, on the &s;oundne&s;s of their philo&s;ophy, and their liberty of thought. <HI>All men,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>are born free and equal: Government and &s;uperiority can only be e&s;tab|li&s;h'd by con&s;ent: The con&s;ent of men, in e&s;tabli&s;hing government, impo&s;es on them a new obligation, unknown to the laws of na|ture. Men, therefore, are bound to obey their</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="155" MS="y">
<HI>magi&s;trates, only becau&s;e they promi&s;e it; and if they had not given their word, either ex|pre&s;sly or tacitly, to pre&s;erve allegiance, it would never have become a part of their moral duty.</HI> This conclu&s;ion, however, when carried &s;o far as to comprehend govern|ment in all its ages and &s;ituations, is entirely erroneous; and I maintain, that tho' the duty of allegiance be at fir&s;t grafted on the obligation of promi&s;es, and be for &s;ome time &s;upported by that obligation, yet it quickly takes root of it&s;elf, and has an original obli|gation and authority, independent of all contracts. This is a principle of moment, which we mu&s;t examine with care and at|tention, before we proceed any farther.</P>
<P>'TIS rea&s;onable for tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who a&s;&s;ert ju&s;tice to be a natural virtue, and antecedent to human conventions, to re&s;olve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promi&s;e, and a&s;&s;ert that 'tis our own con&s;ent alone, which binds us to any &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to magi&s;tracy. For as all govern|ment is plainly an invention of men, and the origin of mo&s;t governments is known in hi&s;tory, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to mount higher, in order to find the &s;ource of our political du|ties, if we wou'd a&s;&s;ert them to have any <HI>natural</HI> obligation of morality. The&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers,
<PB N="147" REF="156">
therefore, quickly ob&s;erve, that &s;ociety is an antient as the human &s;pecies, and tho&s;e three fundamental laws of nature as antient as &s;ociety: So that taking advan|tage of the antiquity, and ob&s;cure origin of the&s;e laws, they fir&s;t deny them to be arti|ficial and voluntary inventions of men, and then &s;eek to ingraft on them tho&s;e other duties, which are more plainly artificial. But being once undeceiv'd in this particular, and having found that <HI>natural,</HI> as well as <HI>civil</HI> ju&s;tice, derives its origin from human conventions, we &s;hall quickly perceive, how fruitle&s;s it is to re&s;olve the one into the other, and &s;eek, in the laws of nature, a &s;tronger foundation for our political duties than in|tere&s;t, and human conventions; while the&s;e laws them&s;elves are built on the very &s;ame foundation. On which ever &s;ide we turn this &s;ubject, we &s;hall find, that the&s;e two kinds of duty are exactly on the &s;ame foot|ing, and have the &s;ame &s;ource both of their <HI>fir&s;t invention</HI> and <HI>moral obligation.</HI> They are contriv'd to remedy like inconveniences, and acquire their moral &s;anction in the &s;ame manner, from their remedying tho&s;e incon|veniences. The&s;e are two points, which we we &s;hall endeavour to prove as di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157">
WE have already &s;hewn, that men <HI>in|vented</HI> the three fundamental laws of nature, when they ob&s;erv'd the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ociety to their mutual &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and found, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to maintain any corre&s;pon|dence together, without &s;ome re&s;traint on their natural appetites. The &s;ame &s;elf-love, therefore, which renders men &s;o incommo|dious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of ju&s;tice, and is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> motive of their ob|&s;ervance. But when men have ob&s;erv'd, that tho' the rules of ju&s;tice be &s;ufficient to maintain any &s;ociety, yet 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for them, of them&s;elves, to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules, in large and poli&s;h'd &s;ocieties; they e&s;tabli&s;h government, as a new invention to attain their ends, and pre&s;erve the old, or procure new advantages, by a more &s;trict execution of ju&s;tice. So far, therefore, our <HI>civil</HI> duties are connected with our <HI>natural,</HI> that the former are invented chiefly for the &s;ake of the latter; and that the principal object of government is to con&s;train men to ob&s;erve the laws of nature. In this re&s;pect, however, that law of nature, concerning the per|formance of promi&s;es, is only compriz'd along with the re&s;t; and its exact ob&s;ervance is to be con&s;ider'd as an effect of the in&s;ti|tution
<PB N="149" REF="158">
of government, and not the obedience to government as an effect of the obligation of a promi&s;e. Tho' the object of our civil duties be the enforcing of our natural, yet the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t in time, not in dignity or force.</NOTE> <HI>fir&s;t</HI> motive of the invention, as well as performance of both, is nothing but &s;elf|intere&s;t: And &s;ince there is a &s;eparate in|tere&s;t in the obedience to government, from that in the performance of promi&s;es, we mu&s;t al&s;o allow of a &s;eparate obligation. To obey the civil magi&s;trate is requi&s;ite to pre|&s;erve order and concord in &s;ociety. To per|form promi&s;es is requi&s;ite to beget mutual tru&s;t and confidence in the common offices of life. The ends, as well as the means, are perfectly di&s;tinct; nor is the one &s;ubor|dinate to the other.</P>
<P>TO make this more evident, let us con|&s;ider, that men will often bind them&s;elves by promi&s;es to the performance of what it wou'd have been their intere&s;t to perform, independent of the&s;e promi&s;es; as when they wou'd give others a fuller &s;ecurity, by &s;uper-adding a new obligation of intere&s;t to that which they formerly lay under. The intere&s;t in the performance of promi&s;es, be|&s;ides its moral obligation, is general, avow'd, and of the la&s;t con&s;equence in life. Other
<PB N="150" REF="159">
intere&s;ts may be more particular and doubt|ful; and we are apt to entertain a greater &s;u&s;picion, that men may indulge their hu|mour, or pa&s;&s;ion, in acting contrary to them. Here, therefore, promi&s;es come naturally in play, and are often requir'd for fuller &s;ati&s;|faction and &s;ecurity. But &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e other intere&s;ts to be as general and avow'd as the intere&s;t in the performance of a pro|mi&s;e, they will be regarded as on the &s;ame footing, and men will begin to repo&s;e the &s;ame confidence in them. Now this is ex|actly the ca&s;e with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magi&s;trate; without which no government cou'd &s;ub&s;i&s;t, nor any peace or order be maintain'd in large &s;o|cieties, where there are &s;o many po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the one hand, and &s;o many wants, real or imaginary, on the other. Our civil duties, therefore, mu&s;t &s;oon detach them&s;elves from our promi&s;es, and acquire a &s;eparate force and influence. The intere&s;t in both is of the very &s;ame kind: 'Tis general, avow'd, and prevails in all times and places. There is, then, no pretext of rea&s;on for founding the one upon the other; while each of them has a foundation peculiar to it&s;elf. We might as well re&s;olve the obligation to ab|&s;tain from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of others, into
<PB N="151" REF="160">
the obligation of a promi&s;e, as that of alle|giance. The intere&s;ts are not more di&s;tinct in the one ca&s;e than the other. A regard to property is not more nece&s;&s;ary to natural &s;ociety, than obedience is to civil &s;ociety or government; nor is the former &s;ociety more nece&s;&s;ary to the being of mankind, than the latter to their well-being and happine&s;s. In &s;hort, if the performance of promi&s;es be ad|vantageous, &s;o is obedience to government: If the former intere&s;t be general, &s;o is the latter: If the one intere&s;t be obvious and avow'd, &s;o is the other. And as the&s;e two rules are founded on like obligations of in|tere&s;t, each of them mu&s;t have a peculiar authority, independent of the other.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis not only the <HI>natural</HI> obligations of intere&s;t, which are di&s;tinct in promi&s;es and allegiance; but al&s;o the <HI>moral</HI> obliga|tions of honour and con&s;cience: Nor does the merit or demerit of the one depend in the lea&s;t upon that of the other. And in|deed, if we con&s;ider the clo&s;e connexion there is betwixt the natural and moral obli|gations, we &s;hall find this conclu&s;ion to be entirely unavoidable. Our intere&s;t is always engag'd on the &s;ide of obedience to magi|&s;tracy; and there is nothing but a great pre|&s;ent advantage, that can lead us to rebellion,
<PB N="152" REF="161" MS="y">
by making us over-look the remote intere&s;t, which we have in the pre&s;erving of peace and order in &s;ociety. But tho' a pre&s;ent in|tere&s;t may thus blind us with regard to our own actions, it takes not place with regard to tho&s;e of others; nor hinders them from appearing in their true colours, as highly prejudicial to public intere&s;t; and to our own in particular. This naturally gives us an un|ea&s;ine&s;s, in con&s;idering &s;uch &s;editious and di&s;loyal actions, and makes us attach to them the idea of vice and moral deformity. 'Tis the &s;ame principle, which cau&s;es us to di&s;approve of all kinds of private inju&s;tice, and in particular of the breach of promi&s;es. We blame all treachery and breach of faith; becau&s;e we con&s;ider, that the freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity with regard to promi&s;es. We blame all di&s;loyalty to magi&s;trates; becau&s;e we perceive, that the execution of ju&s;tice, in the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, its tran&s;lation by con&s;ent, and the performance of promi&s;es, is impo&s;&s;ible, without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to govern|ment. As there are here two intere&s;ts en|tirely di&s;tinct from each other, they mu&s;t give ri&s;e to two moral obligations, equally &s;e|parate and independant. Tho' there was no &s;uch thing as a promi&s;e in the world, go|vernment
<PB N="153" REF="162">
wou'd &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary in all large and civiliz'd &s;ocieties; and if promi&s;es had only their own proper obligation, without the &s;eparate &s;anction of government, they wou'd have but little efficacy in &s;uch &s;oci|eties. This &s;eparates the boundaries of our public and private duties, and &s;hews that the latter are more dependant on the former, than the former on the latter. <HI>Education,</HI> and <HI>the artifice of politicians,</HI> concur to be|&s;tow a farther morality on loyalty, and to brand all rebellion with a greater degree of guilt and infamy. Nor is it a wonder, that politicians &s;hou'd be very indu&s;trious in in|culcating &s;uch notions, where their intere&s;t is &s;o particularly concern'd.</P>
<P>LEST tho&s;e arguments &s;hou'd not appear entirely conclu&s;ive (as I think they are) I &s;hall have recour&s;e to authority, and &s;hall prove, from the univer&s;al con&s;ent of man|kind, that the obligation of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government is not deriv'd from any promi&s;e of the &s;ubjects. Nor need any one wonder, that tho' I have all along endeavour'd to e&s;tabli&s;h my &s;y&s;tem on pure rea&s;on, and have &s;carce ever cited the judgment even of phi|lo&s;ophers or hi&s;torians on any article, I &s;hou'd now appeal to popular authority, and oppo&s;e the &s;entiments of the rabble to any philo&s;o|phical

rea&s;oning. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that the opinions of men, in this ca&s;e, carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in a great mea&s;ure, infallible. The di&s;tinction of moral good and evil is founded on the plea&s;ure or pain, which re&s;ults from the view of any &s;entiment, or character; and as that plea&s;ure or pain cannot be unknown to the per&s;on who feels it, it follows, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This propo&s;ition mu&s;t hold &s;trictly true, with regard to every quality, that is determin'd merely by &s;entiment.

A man, who acknowledges him&s;elf to be bound to another, for a certain &s;um, mu&s;t certainly know whether it be by his own bond, or that of his father; whether it be of his mere good-will, or for money lent

him; and under what conditions, and for what purpo&s;es he has bound him&s;elf. In like manner, it being certain, that there is a moral obligation to &s;ubmit to government, becau&s;e every one thinks &s;o; it mu&s;t be as certain, that this obligation ari&s;es not from a promi&s;e; &s;ince no one, who&s;e judgment has not been led a&s;tray by too &s;trict adherence to a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, has ever yet dreamt of a&s;cribing it to that origin. Neither magi&s;trates nor &s;ubjects have form'd this idea of our civil duties.</P>
<P>WE find, that magi&s;trates are &s;o far from deriving their authority, and the obligation to obedience in their &s;ubjects, from the foun|dation of a promi&s;e or original contract, that they conceal, as far as po&s;&s;ible, from their people, e&s;pecially from the vulgar, that they have their origin from thence. Were this the &s;anction of government, our rulers wou'd never receive it tacitly, which is the utmo&s;t that can be pretended; &s;ince what is given tacitly and in&s;en&s;ibly can never have &s;uch influence on mankind, as what is per|form'd expre&s;&s;ly and openly. A tacit pro|mi&s;e is, where the will is &s;ignified by other more diffu&s;e &s;igns than tho&s;e of &s;peech; but a will there mu&s;t certainly be in the ca&s;e, and that can never e&s;cape the per&s;on's no|tice,

who exerted it, however &s;ilent or tacit. But were you to a&s;k the far greate&s;t part of the nation, whether they had ever con&s;ented to the authority of their rulers, or promis'd to obey them, they wou'd be inclin'd to think very &s;trangely of you; and wou'd cer|tainly reply, that the affair depended not on their con&s;ent, but that they were born to &s;uch an obedience. In con&s;equence of this opinion, we frequently &s;ee them imagine &s;uch per&s;ons to be their natural rulers, as are at that time depriv'd of all power and authority, and whom no man, however fooli&s;h, wou'd voluntarily chu&s;e; and this merely becau&s;e they are in that line, which rul'd before, and in that degree of it, which us'd to &s;ucceed; tho' perhaps in &s;o di&s;tant a period, that &s;carce any man alive cou'd ever have given any promi&s;e of obedience. Has a government, then, no authority over &s;uch as the&s;e, becau&s;e they never con&s;ented to it, and wou'd e&s;teem the very attempt of &s;uch a free choice a piece of arrogance and im|piety? We find by experience, that it pu|ni&s;hes them very freely for what it calls trea|&s;on and rebellion, which, it &s;eems, accord|ing to this &s;y&s;tem, reduces it&s;elf to com|mon inju&s;tice. If you &s;ay, that by dwelling in its dominions, they in effect con&s;ented to
<PB N="157" REF="166">
the e&s;tabli&s;h'd government; I an&s;wer, that this can only be, where they think the affair depends on their choice, which few or none, be&s;ide tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, have ever yet imagin'd. It never was pleaded as an ex|cu&s;e for a rebel, that the fir&s;t act he per|form'd, after he came to years of di&s;cretion, was to levy war again&s;t the &s;overeign of the &s;tate; and that while he was a child he cou'd not bind him&s;elf by his own con&s;ent, and having become a man, &s;how'd plainly, by the fir&s;t act he perform'd, that he had no de&s;ign to impo&s;e on him&s;elf any obligation to obedience. We find, on the contrary, that civil laws puni&s;h this crime at the &s;ame age as any other, which is criminal, of it|&s;elf, without our con&s;ent; that is, when the per&s;on is come to the full u&s;e of rea&s;on: Whereas to this crime it ought in ju&s;tice to allow &s;ome intermediate time, in which a tacit con&s;ent at lea&s;t might be &s;uppos'd. To which we may add, that a man living under an ab&s;olute government, wou'd owe it no allegiance; &s;ince, by its very nature, it depends not on con&s;ent. But as that is as <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>common</HI> a government as any, it mu&s;t certainly occa&s;ion &s;ome obligation; and 'tis plain from experience, that men, who are &s;ubjected to it, do always think

&s;o. This is a clear proof, that we do not commonly e&s;teem our allegiance to be de|riv'd from our con&s;ent or promi&s;e; and a farther proof is, that when our promi&s;e is upon any account expre&s;sly engag'd, we al|ways di&s;tingui&s;h exactly betwixt the two obligations, and believe the one to add more force to the other, than in a repetition of the &s;ame promi&s;e. Where no promi&s;e is given, a man looks not on his faith as bro|ken in private matters, upon account of rebellion; but keeps tho&s;e two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. As the uniting of them was thought by the&s;e philo&s;ophers a very &s;ubtle invention, this is a convincing proof, that 'tis not a true one; &s;ince no man can either give a promi&s;e, or be re&s;train'd by its &s;anc|tion and obligation unknown to him&s;elf.</P>

tho' the rea&s;oning, upon which they endea|vour'd to e&s;tabli&s;h it, was fallacious and &s;o|phi&s;tical.

<P>I REPEAT it: This conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t, tho' the principles be erroneous; and I flat|ter my&s;elf, that I can e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame conclu&s;ion on more rea&s;onable principles. I &s;hall not take &s;uch a compa&s;s, in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing our political duties, as to a&s;&s;ert, that men perceive the advantages of government; that they in&s;titute government with a view to tho&s;e advantages; that this in&s;titution re|quires a promi&s;e of obedience; which im|po&s;es a moral obligation to a certain degree, but being conditional, cea&s;es to be binding, whenever the other contracting party per|forms not his part of the engagement. I perceive, that a promi&s;e it&s;elf ari&s;es entirely from human conventions, and is invented with a view to a certain intere&s;t. I &s;eek, therefore, &s;ome &s;uch intere&s;t more immedi|ately connected with government, and which may be at once the original motive to its in|&s;titution, and the &s;ource of our obedience to it. This intere&s;t I find to con&s;i&s;t in the &s;e|curity and protection, which we enjoy in political &s;ociety, and which we can never at|tain, when perfectly free and independent.
<PB N="161" REF="170">
As the intere&s;t, therefore, is the immediate &s;anction of government, the one can have no longer being than the other; and when|ever the civil magi&s;trate carries his oppre&s;&s;ion &s;o far as to render his authority perfectly intolerable, we are no longer bound to &s;ub|mit to it. The cau&s;e cea&s;es; the effect mu&s;t cea&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>SO far the conclu&s;ion is immediate and direct, concerning the <HI>natural</HI> obligation which we have to allegiance. As to the <HI>moral</HI> obligation, we may ob&s;erve, that the maxim wou'd here be fal&s;e, that <HI>when the cau&s;e cea&s;es, the effect mu&s;t cea&s;e al&s;o.</HI> For there is a principle of human nature, which we have frequently taken notice of, that men are mightily addicted to <HI>general rules,</HI> and that we often carry our maxims beyond tho&s;e rea&s;ons, which fir&s;t induc'd us to e&s;tabli&s;h them. Where ca&s;es are &s;imilar in many circum&s;tances, we are apt to put them on the &s;ame footing, without con|&s;idering, that they differ in the mo&s;t mate|rial circum&s;tances, and that the re&s;emblance is more apparent than real. It may, there|fore, be thought, that in the ca&s;e of alle|giance our moral obligation of duty will not cea&s;e, even tho' the natural obligation of intere&s;t, which is its cau&s;e, has ceas'd; and
<PB N="162" REF="171">
that men may be bound by <HI>con&s;cience</HI> to &s;ubmit to a tyrannical government again&s;t their own and the public intere&s;t. And indeed, to the force of this argument I &s;o far &s;ubmit, as to acknowledge, that general rules commonly extend beyond the prin|ciples, on which they are founded; and that we &s;eldom make any exception to them, unle&s;s that exception have the qualities of a general rule, and be founded on very nu|merous and common in&s;tances. Now this I a&s;&s;ert to be entirely the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. When men &s;ubmit to the authority of others, 'tis to procure them&s;elves &s;ome &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the wickedne&s;s and inju&s;tice of men, who are perpetually carried, by their unruly pa&s;&s;ions, and by their pre&s;ent and immediate intere&s;t, to the violation of all the laws of &s;ociety. But as this imperfection is inherent in human nature, we know that it mu&s;t attend men in all their &s;tates and conditions; and that tho&s;e, whom we chu&s;e for rulers, do not immediately become of a &s;uperior nature to the re&s;t of mankind, upon account of their &s;uperior power and autho|rity. What we expect from them depends not on a change of their nature but of their &s;itu|ation, when they acquire a more immediate intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of order and the
<PB N="163" REF="172">
execution of ju&s;tice. But be&s;ides that this intere&s;t is only more immediate in the ex|ecution of ju&s;tice among their &s;ubjects; be|&s;ides this, I &s;ay, we may often expect, from the irregularity of human nature, that they will neglect even this immediate intere&s;t, and be tran&s;ported by their pa&s;&s;ions into all the exce&s;&s;es of cruelty and ambition. Our ge|neral knowledge of human nature, our ob|&s;ervation of the pa&s;t hi&s;tory of mankind, our experience of pre&s;ent times; all the&s;e cau&s;es mu&s;t induce us to open the door to exceptions, and mu&s;t make us conclude, that we may re&s;i&s;t the more violent effects of &s;upreme power, without any crime or inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we may ob&s;erve, that this is both the general practice and principle of mankind, and that no nation, that cou'd find any remedy, ever yet &s;uffer'd the cruel ravages of a tyrant, or were blam'd for their re&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e who took up arms again&s;t <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> or <HI>Nero,</HI> or <HI>Philip the &s;econd,</HI> have the favour of every reader in the peru&s;al of their hi&s;tory; and nothing but the mo&s;t violent perver&s;ion of common &s;en&s;e can ever lead us to condemn them. 'Tis certain, therefore, that in all our notions of morals we never entertain &s;uch an ab&s;urdity as that
<PB N="164" REF="173">
of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, but make allowances for re&s;i&s;tance in the more flagrant in&s;tances of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. The general opinion of mankind has &s;ome authority in all ca&s;es; but in this of morals 'tis perfectly infallible. Nor is it le&s;s infallible, becau&s;e men cannot di&s;tinctly explain the principles, on which it is founded. Few per&s;ons can carry on this train of rea&s;oning: <Q>"Govern|ment is a mere human invention for the intere&s;t of &s;ociety. Where the tyranny of the governor removes this intere&s;t, it al&s;o removes the natural obligation to obe|dience. The moral obligation is founded on the natural, and therefore mu&s;t cea&s;e where <HI>that</HI> cea&s;es; e&s;pecially where the &s;ubject is &s;uch as makes us fore&s;ee very many occa&s;ions wherein the natural obli|gation may cea&s;e, and cau&s;es us to form a kind of general rule for the regulation of our conduct in &s;uch occurrences."</Q> But tho' this train of rea&s;oning be too &s;ubtile for the vulgar, 'tis certain, that all men have an implicit notion of it, and are &s;en&s;ible, that they owe obedience to government merely on account of the public intere&s;t; and at the &s;ame time, that human nature is &s;o &s;ubject to frailties and pa&s;&s;ions, as may ea&s;ily pervert this in&s;titution, and change
<PB N="165" REF="174">
their governors into tyrants and public ene|mies. If the &s;en&s;e of public intere&s;t were not our original motive to obedience, I wou'd fain a&s;k, what other principle is there in human nature capable of &s;ubduing the natural ambition of men, and forcing them to &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Imitation and cu&s;tom are not &s;ufficient. For the que&s;tion &s;till re|curs, what motive fir&s;t produces tho&s;e in|&s;tances of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which we imitate, and that train of actions, which produces the cu&s;tom? There evidently is no other prin|ciple than public intere&s;t; and if intere&s;t fir&s;t produces obedience to government, the obligation to obedience mu&s;t cea&s;e, when|ever the intere&s;t cea&s;es, in any great degree, and in a con&s;iderable number of in&s;tances.</P>

<P>BUT tho', on &s;ome occa&s;ions, it may be ju&s;tifiable, both in &s;ound politics and morality, to re&s;i&s;t &s;upreme power, 'tis cer|tain, that in the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs nothing can be more pernicious and criminal; and that be&s;ides the convul&s;ions,
<PB N="166" REF="175" MS="y">
which always attend revolutions, &s;uch a practice tends directly to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all government, and the cau&s;ing an univer&s;al anarchy and confu&s;ion among mankind. As numerous and civiliz'd &s;ocieties cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without government, &s;o government is entirely u&s;ele&s;s without an exact obedience. We ought always to weigh the advantages, which we reap from authority, again&s;t the di&s;advantages; and by this means we &s;hall become more &s;crupulous of putting in prac|tice the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance. The com|mon rule requires &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and 'tis only in ca&s;es of grievous tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, that the exception can take place.</P>
<P>SINCE then &s;uch a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is commonly due to magi&s;tracy, the next que&s;tion is, <HI>to whom it is due, and whom we are to regard as our lawful magi&s;trates?</HI> In order to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, let us re|collect what we have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd con|cerning the origin of government and poli|tical &s;ociety. When men have once expe|rienc'd the impo&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;erving any &s;teady order in &s;ociety, while every one is his own ma&s;ter, and violates or ob&s;erves the laws of intere&s;t, according to his pre&s;ent intere&s;t or plea&s;ure, they naturally run into the in|vention of government, and put it out of
<PB N="167" REF="176" MS="y">
their own power, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to tran&s;|gre&s;s the laws of &s;ociety. Government, therefore, ari&s;es from the voluntary conven|tion of men; and 'tis evident, that the &s;ame convention, which e&s;tabli&s;hes government, will al&s;o determine the per&s;ons who are to govern, and will remove all doubt and am|biguity in this particular. And the volun|tary con&s;ent of men mu&s;t here have the greater efficacy, that the authority of the magi&s;trate does <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> &s;tand upon the foun|dation of a promi&s;e of the &s;ubjects, by which they bind them&s;elves to obedience; as in every other contract or engagement. The &s;ame promi&s;e, then, which binds them to obedience, ties them down to a particular per&s;on, and makes him the object of their allegiance.</P>
<P>BUT when government has been e&s;tabi&s;h'd on this footing for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and the &s;eparate intere&s;t, which we have in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, has produc'd a &s;eparate &s;enti|ment of morality, the ca&s;e is entirely alter'd, and a promi&s;e is no longer able to determine the particular magi&s;trate; &s;ince it is no longer con&s;ider'd as the foundation of go|vernment. We naturally &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves born to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and imagine, that &s;uch particular per&s;ons have a right to command,
<PB N="168" REF="177">
as we on our part are bound to obey. The&s;e notions of right and obligation are deriv'd from nothing but the <HI>advantage</HI> we reapt from government, which gives us a repugnance to practi&s;e re&s;i&s;tance our&s;elves, and makes us di&s;pleas'd with any in&s;tance of it in others. But here 'tis remarkable, that in this new &s;tate of affairs, the original &s;anction of government, which is <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> is not admitted to determine the per&s;ons, whom we are to obey, as the original &s;anc|tion did at fir&s;t, when affairs were on the footing of a <HI>promi&s;e.</HI> A <HI>promi&s;e</HI> fixes and determines the per&s;ons, without any uncer|tainty: But 'tis evident, that if men were to regulate their conduct in this particular, by the view of a peculiar <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> either public or private, they wou'd involve them|&s;elves in endle&s;s confu&s;ion, and wou'd render all government, in a great mea&s;ure, in|effectual. The private intere&s;t of every one is different; and tho' the public intere&s;t in it&s;elf be always one and the &s;ame, yet it becomes the &s;ource of as great di&s;&s;entions, by rea&s;on of the different opinions of par|ticular per&s;ons concerning it. The &s;ame in|tere&s;t, therefore, which cau&s;es us to &s;ubmit to magi&s;tracy, makes us renounce it&s;elf in the choice of our magi&s;trates, and binds us
<PB N="169" REF="178">
down to a certain form of government, and to particular per&s;ons, without allowing us to a&s;pire to the utmo&s;t perfection in either. The ca&s;e is here the &s;ame as in that law of nature concerning the &s;tability of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. 'Tis highly advantageous, and even ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ociety, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd be &s;table; and this leads us to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a rule: But we find, that were we to follow the &s;ame advantage, in a&s;&s;igning particular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to particu|lar per&s;ons, we &s;hou'd di&s;appoint our end, and perpetuate the confu&s;ion, which that rule is intended to prevent. We mu&s;t, therefore, proceed by general rules, and re|gulate our&s;elves by general intere&s;ts, in mo|difying the law of nature concerning the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Nor need we fear, that our attachment to this law will dimini&s;h upon account of the &s;eeming frivolou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e intere&s;ts, by which it is determin'd. The impul&s;e of the mind is deriv'd from a very &s;trong intere&s;t; and tho&s;e other more minute intere&s;ts &s;erve only to direct the mo|tion, without adding any thing to it, or dimini&s;hing from it. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with government. Nothing is more advan|tageous to &s;ociety than &s;uch an invention; and this intere&s;t is &s;ufficient to make us em|brace
<PB N="170" REF="179" MS="y">
it with ardour and alacrity; tho' we are oblig'd afterwards to regulate and direct our devotion to government by &s;everal con|&s;iderations, which are not of the &s;ame im|portance, and to chu&s;e our magi&s;trates with|out having in view any particular advantage from the choice.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e principles I &s;hall take notice of, as a foundation of the right of magi&s;tracy, is that which gives authority to all the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd governments of the world without exception: I mean, <HI>long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> in any one form of government, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes. 'Tis certain, that if we remount to the fir&s;t origin of every na|tion, we &s;hall find, that there &s;carce is any race of kings, or form of a commonwealth, that is not primarily founded on u&s;urpation and rebellion, and who&s;e title is not at fir&s;t wor&s;e than doubtful and uncertain. Time alone gives &s;olidity to their right; and ope|rating gradually on the minds of men, re|conciles them to any authority, and makes it &s;eem ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. Nothing cau&s;es any &s;entiment to have a greater influence upon us than cu&s;tom, or turns our imagina|tion more &s;trongly to any object. When we have been long accu&s;tom'd to obey any &s;et of men, that general in&s;tinct or tendency,
<PB N="171" REF="180">
which we have to &s;uppo&s;e a moral obligation attending loyalty, takes ea&s;ily this direction, and chu&s;es that &s;et of men for its objects. 'Tis intere&s;t which gives the general in&s;tinct; but 'tis cu&s;tom which gives the particular direction.</P>
<P>AND here 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the &s;ame length of time has a different influence on our &s;entiments of morality, according to its different influence on the mind. We natu|rally judge of every thing by compari&s;on; and &s;ince in con&s;idering the fate of kingdoms and republics, we embrace a long extent of time, a &s;mall duration has not in this ca&s;e a like influence on our &s;entiments, as when we con&s;ider any other object. One thinks he acquires a right to a hor&s;e, or a &s;uit of cloaths, in a very &s;hort time; but a century is &s;carce &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h any new go|vernment, or remove all &s;cruples in the minds of the &s;ubjects concerning it. Add to this, that a &s;horter period of time will &s;uffice to give a prince a title to any addi|tional power he may u&s;urp, than will &s;erve to fix his right, where the whole is an u&s;urpation, The kings of <HI>France</HI> have not been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of ab&s;olute power for above two reigns; and yet nothing will appear more extravagant to <HI>Frenchmen</HI> than to talk
<PB N="172" REF="181">
of their liberties. If we con&s;ider what has been &s;aid concerning <HI>acce&s;&s;ion,</HI> we &s;hall ea&s;ily account for this phaenomenon.</P>
<P>WHEN there is no form of government e&s;tabli&s;h'd by <HI>long</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;ufficient to &s;upply its place, and may be regarded as the <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;ource of all public authority. Right to authority is nothing but the con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of autho|rity, maintain'd by the laws of &s;ociety and the intere&s;ts of mankind; and nothing can be more natural than to join this con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent one, according to the principles above-mention'd. If the &s;ame principles did not take place with regard to the property of private per&s;ons, 'twas be|cau&s;e the&s;e principles were counter-ballanc'd by very &s;trong con&s;iderations of intere&s;t; when we ob&s;erv'd, that all re&s;titution wou'd by that means be prevented, and every vio|lence be authoriz'd and protected. And tho' the &s;ame motives may &s;eem to have force, with regard to public authority, yet they are oppos'd by a contrary intere&s;t; which con&s;i&s;ts in the pre&s;ervation of peace, and the avoiding of all changes, which, how|ever they may be ea&s;ily produc'd in private affairs, are unavoidably attended with blood|&s;hed
<PB N="173" REF="182">
and confu&s;ion, where the public is intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>ANY one, who finding the impo&s;&s;ibility of accounting for the right of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, by any receiv'd &s;y&s;tem of ethics, &s;hou'd re&s;olve to deny ab&s;olutely that right, and a&s;&s;ert, that it is not authoriz'd by mo|rality, wou'd be ju&s;tly thought to maintain a very extravagant paradox, and to &s;hock the common &s;en&s;e and judgment of mankind. No maxim is more conformable, both to prudence and morals, than to &s;ubmit quietly to the government, which we find e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the country where we happen to live, without enquiring too curiou&s;ly into its origin and fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. Few govern|ments will bear being examin'd &s;o rigorou&s;ly. How many kingdoms are there at pre&s;ent in the world, and how many more do we find in hi&s;tory, who&s;e governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? To confine our&s;elves to the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> empire; is it not evident, that the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of emperors, from the di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Roman</HI> liberty, to the final extinction of that empire by the <HI>Turks,</HI> cou'd not &s;o much as pretend to any other title to the empire? The election of the &s;enate was a mere form, which always
<PB N="174" REF="183">
follow'd the choice of the legions; and the&s;e were almo&s;t always divided in the dif|ferent provinces, and nothing but the &s;word was able to terminate the difference. 'Twas by the &s;word, therefore, that every emperor acquir'd, as well as defended his right; and we mu&s;t either &s;ay, that all the known world, for &s;o many ages, had no govern|ment, and ow'd no allegiance to any one, or mu&s;t allow, that the right of the &s;tronger, in public affairs, is to be receiv'd as legiti|mate, and authoriz'd by morality, when not oppos'd by any other title.</P>
<P>THE right of <HI>conque&s;t</HI> may be con&s;ider'd as a <HI>third</HI> &s;ource of the title of &s;overeigns. This right re&s;embles very much that of pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but has rather a &s;uperior force, being &s;econded by the notions of glory and honour, which we a&s;cribe to <HI>con|querors,</HI> in&s;tead of the &s;entiments of hatred and dete&s;tation, which attend <HI>u&s;urpers.</HI> Men naturally favour tho&s;e they love; and there|fore are more apt to a&s;cribe a right to &s;uc|ce&s;sful violence, betwixt one &s;overign and another, than to the &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion of a &s;ubject again&s;t his &s;overeign <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is not here a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>conque&s;t</HI> are &s;ufficient to give a title again&s;t <HI>long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>po&s;i|tive laws:</HI> But only that they have &s;ome force, and will be able to ca&s;t the ballance where the titles are otherwi&s;e equal, and will even be &s;ufficient <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> to &s;anctify the weaker title.

<P>To confirm this we may weigh the fol|lowing phaenomena, which are pretty curi|ous in their kind.

Hence in &s;ome governments of this kind, the choice com|monly falls on one or other of the royal family; and in &s;ome governments they are all excluded. Tho&s;e contrary phaenomena proceed from the &s;ame principle. Where the royal family is excluded, 'tis from a re|finement in politics, which makes people &s;en&s;ible of their propen&s;ity to chu&s;e a &s;o|vereign in that family, and gives them a jealou&s;y of their liberty, le&s;t their new monarch, aided by this propen&s;ity, &s;hou'd e&s;tabli&s;h his family, and de&s;troy the free|dom of elections for the future.</P>

I wou'd only infer from it, that he wou'd never have made u&s;e of &s;uch a pretext, were it not for the qua|lities of the imagination above-mention'd, by which we are naturally inclin'd to unite by a new relation whatever objects we find al|ready united. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> had an advantage above his brother, as being the elde&s;t &s;on, and the fir&s;t in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: But <HI>Cyrus</HI> was more clo&s;ely related to the royal authority, as being begot after his father was inve&s;ted with it.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it here be pretended, that the view of convenience may be the &s;ource of all the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that men gladly take advantage of any rule, by which they can fix the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of their late &s;o|vereign, and prevent that anarchy and con|fu&s;ion, which attends all new elections: To this I wou'd an&s;wer, that I readily allow, that this motive may contribute &s;omething to the effect; but at the &s;ame time I a&s;&s;ert, that without another principle, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="178" REF="187">
&s;uch a motive &s;hou'd take place. The in|tere&s;t of a nation requires, that the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown &s;hou'd be fix'd one way or other; but 'tis the &s;ame thing to its in|tere&s;t in what way it be fix'd: So that if the relation of blood had not an effect in|dependent of public intere&s;t, it wou'd never have been regarded, without a po&s;itive law; and 'twou'd have been impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o many po&s;itive laws of different nations cou'd ever have concur'd preci&s;ely in the &s;ame views and intentions.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to con&s;ider the <HI>fifth</HI> &s;ource of authority, viz. <HI>po&s;itive laws;</HI> when the legi&s;lature e&s;tabli&s;hes a certain form of go|vernment and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes. At fir&s;t &s;ight it may be thought, that this mu&s;t re&s;olve into &s;ome of the preceding titles of authority. The legi&s;lative power, whence the po&s;itive law is deriv'd, mu&s;t either be e&s;tabli&s;h'd by original contract, long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, conque&s;t, or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; and con&s;equently the po&s;itive law mu&s;t derive its force from &s;ome of tho&s;e principles. But here 'tis remarkable, that tho' a po&s;itive law can only derive its force from the&s;e principles, yet it acquires not all the force of the principle from whence it is deriv'd, but lo&s;es con&s;iderably in the tran&s;i|tion;
<PB N="179" REF="188">
as it is natural to imagine. For in|&s;tance; a government is e&s;tabli&s;h'd for many centuries on a certain &s;y&s;tem of laws, forms, and methods of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The legi&s;lative power, e&s;tabli&s;h'd by this long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, changes all on a &s;udden the whole &s;y&s;tem of government, and introduces a new con&s;titu|tion in its &s;tead. I believe few of the &s;ub|jects will think them&s;elves bound to comply with this alteration, unle&s;s it have an evi|dent tendency to the public good: But will think them&s;elves &s;till at liberty to return to the antient government. Hence the notion of <HI>fundamental laws;</HI> which are &s;uppos'd to be inalterable by the will of the &s;overeign: And of this nature the <HI>Salic</HI> law is under|&s;tood to be in <HI>France.</HI> How far the&s;e funda|mental laws extend is not determind'd in any government; nor is it po&s;&s;ible it ever &s;hou'd. There is &s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible gradation from the mo&s;t material laws to the mo&s;t trivial, and from the mo&s;t antient laws to the mo&s;t modern, that 'twill be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et bounds to the legi&s;lative power, and deter|mine how far it may innovate in the prin|ciples of government. That is the work more of imagination and pa&s;&s;ion than of rea&s;on.</P>

WHOEVER con&s;iders the hi&s;tory of the &s;everal nations of the world; their revolu|tions, conque&s;ts, increa&s;e, and diminution; the manner in which their particular go|vernments are e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive right tran&s;mitted from one per&s;on to another, will &s;oon learn to treat very lightly all di&s;|putes concerning the rights of princes, and will be convinc'd, that a &s;trict adherence to any general rules, and the rigid loyalty to particular per&s;ons and families, on which &s;ome people &s;et &s;o high a value, are virtues that hold le&s;s of rea&s;on, than of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition. In this particular, the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory confirms the rea&s;onings of true philo|&s;ophy; which, &s;hewing us the original quali|ties of human nature, teaches us to regard the controver&s;ies in politics as incapable of any deci&s;ion in mo&s;t ca&s;es, and as entirely &s;ubor|dinate to the intere&s;ts of peace and liberty. Where the public good does not evidently demand a change; 'tis certain, that the con|currence of all tho&s;e titles, <HI>original contract, long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive laws,</HI> forms the &s;tronge&s;t title to &s;overeignty, and is ju&s;tly regarded as &s;acred and inviolable.

they often occa&s;ion perplexity; and are le&s;s capable of &s;olution from the arguments of lawyers and philo&s;ophers, than from the &s;words of the &s;oldiery.

Ought <HI>Germanicus</HI> to be e&s;teem'd the elde&s;t &s;on, becau&s;e he was born before <HI>Dru&s;us;</HI> or the younger, becau&s;e he was adopted after the birth of his brother?

Ought the <HI>Roman</HI> empire at that time to be e&s;teem'd hereditary, becau&s;e of two examples; or ought it, even &s;o early, to be regarded as belonging to the &s;tronger, or the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as being founded on &s;o recent an u&s;urpation? Upon whatever prin|ciples we may pretend to an&s;wer the&s;e and &s;uch like que&s;tions, I am afraid we &s;hall never be able to &s;atisfy an impartial enquirer, who adopts no party in political controver|&s;ies,

and will be &s;atisfied with nothing but &s;ound rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>BUT here an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader will be apt to enquire concerning that famous <HI>revolu|tion,</HI> which has had &s;uch a happy influence on our con&s;titution, and has been attended with &s;uch mighty con&s;equences. We have already remark'd, that in the ca&s;e of enor|mous tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, 'tis lawful to take arms even again&s;t &s;upreme power; and that as government is a mere human inven|tion for mutual advantage and &s;ecurity, it no longer impo&s;es any obligation, either natural or moral, when once it cea&s;es to have that tendency. But tho' this <HI>general</HI> principle be authoriz'd by common &s;en&s;e, and the practice of all ages, 'tis certainly impo&s;&s;ible for the laws, or even for philo|&s;ophy, to e&s;tabli&s;h any <HI>particular</HI> rules, by which we may know when re&s;i&s;tance is lawful; and decide all controver&s;ies, which may ari&s;e on that &s;ubject. This may not only happen with regard to &s;upreme power; but 'tis po&s;&s;ible, even in &s;ome con&s;titu|tions, where the legi&s;lative authority is not lodg'd in one per&s;on, that there may be a magi&s;trate &s;o eminent and powerful, as to oblige the laws to keep &s;ilence in this par|ticular.
<PB N="183" REF="192">
Nor wou'd this &s;ilence be an effect only of their
<HI>re&s;pect,</HI> but al&s;o of their <HI>pru|dence;</HI> &s;ince 'tis certain, that in the va&s;t va|riety of circum&s;tances, which occur in all governments, an exerci&s;e of power, in &s;o great a magi&s;trate, may at one time be bene|ficial to the public, which at another time wou'd be pernicious and tyrannical. But notwith&s;tanding this &s;ilence of the laws in limited monarchies, 'tis certain, that the people &s;till retain the right of re&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, even in the mo&s;t de&s;|potic governments, to deprive them of it. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and the &s;ame motive of public good, give them the &s;ame liberty in the one ca&s;e as in the other. And we may farther ob&s;erve, that in &s;uch mix'd governments, the ca&s;es, wherein re&s;i&s;tance is lawful, mu&s;t occur much oftener, and greater indulgence be given to the &s;ubjects to defend them&s;elves by force of arms, than in arbitrary govern|ments. Not only where the chief magi&s;trate enters into mea&s;ures, in them&s;elves, ex|tremely pernicious to the public, but even when he wou'd encroach on the other parts of the con&s;titution, and extend his power beyond the legal bounds, it is allowable to re&s;i&s;t and dethrone him; tho' &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="184" REF="193">
and violence may, in the general tenor of the laws, be deem'd unlawful and rebellious. For be&s;ides that nothing is more e&s;&s;ential to public intere&s;t, than the pre&s;ervation of public liberty; 'tis evident, that if &s;uch a mix'd government be once &s;uppos'd to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, every part or member of the con&s;titution mu&s;t have a right of &s;elf-defence, and of maintaining its antient bounds again&s;t the encroachment of every other authority. As matter wou'd have been created in vain, were it depriv'd of a power of re&s;i&s;tance, without which no part of it cou'd pre&s;erve a di&s;tinct exi&s;tence, and the whole might be|crowded up into a &s;ingle point: So 'tis a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, in any govern|ment, a right without a remedy, or allow, that the &s;upreme power is &s;har'd with the people, without allowing, that 'tis lawful for them to defend their &s;hare again&s;t every invader. Tho&s;e, therefore, who wou'd &s;eem to re&s;pect our free government, and yet deny the right of re&s;i&s;tance, have renounc'd all preten&s;ions to common &s;en&s;e, and do not merit a &s;erious an&s;wer.</P>
<P>IT does not belong to my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e to &s;hew, that the&s;e general principles are applicable to the late <HI>revolution;</HI> and that all the rights and privileges, which ought
<PB N="185" REF="194">
to be &s;acred to a free nation, were at that time threaten'd with the utmo&s;t danger. I am better pleas'd to leave this controverted &s;ubject, if it really admits of controver&s;y; and to indulge my&s;elf in &s;ome philo&s;ophical reflections, which naturally ari&s;e from that important event.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We may ob&s;erve, that &s;hou'd the <HI>lords</HI> and <HI>commons</HI> in our con&s;titution, with|out any rea&s;on from public intere&s;t, either depo&s;e the king in being, or after his death exclude the prince, who, by laws and &s;ettled cu&s;tom, ought to &s;ucceed, no one wou'd e&s;teem their proceedings legal, or think them&s;elves bound to comply with them. But &s;hou'd the king, by his unju&s;t practices, or his attempts for a tyrannical and de&s;potic power, ju&s;tly forfeit his legal, it then not only becomes morally lawful and &s;uitable to the nature of political &s;ociety to dethrone him; but what is more, we are apt likewi&s;e to think, that the remaining members of the con&s;titution acquire a right of excluding his next heir, and of chu&s;ing whom they plea&s;e for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This is founded on a very &s;ingular quality of our thought and imagi|nation. When a king forfeits his authority, his heir ought naturally to remain in the &s;ame &s;ituation, as if the king were remov'd
<PB N="186" REF="195">
by death; unle&s;s by mixing him&s;elf in the tyranny, he forfeit it for him&s;elf. But tho' this may &s;eem rea&s;onable, we ea&s;ily comply with the contrary opinion. The depo&s;ition of a king, in &s;uch a government as ours, is certainly an act beyond all common autho|rity, and an illegal a&s;&s;uming a power for public good, which, in the ordinary cour&s;e of government, can belong to no member of the con&s;titution. When the public good is &s;o great and &s;o evident as to ju&s;tify the action, the commendable u&s;e of this licence cau&s;es us naturally to attribute to the <HI>parlia|ment</HI> a right of u&s;ing farther licences; and the antient bounds of the laws being once tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with approbation, we are not apt to be &s;o &s;trict in confining our&s;elves preci&s;ely within their limits. The mind naturally runs on with any train of action, which it has begun; nor do we commonly make any &s;cruple concerning our duty, after the fir&s;t action of any kind, which we perform. Thus at the <HI>revolution,</HI> no one who thought the depo&s;ition of the father ju&s;tifiable, e&s;teem'd them&s;elves to be confin'd to his infant &s;on; tho' had that unhappy monarch died innocent at that time, and had his &s;on, by any accident, been convey'd beyond &s;eas, there is no doubt but a regency wou'd have
<PB N="187" REF="196">
been appointed till he &s;hou'd come to age, and cou'd be re&s;tor'd to his dominions. As the &s;lighte&s;t properties of the imagination have an effect on the judgments of the people, it &s;hews the wi&s;dom of the laws and of the parliament to take advantage of &s;uch properties, and to chu&s;e the magi&s;trates either in or out of a line, according as the vulgar will mo&s;t naturally attribute authority and right to them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho' the acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> to the throne might at fir&s;t give occa&s;ion to many di&s;putes, and his title be conte&s;ted, it ought not now to appear doubt|ful, but mu&s;t have acquir'd a &s;ufficient au|thority from tho&s;e three princes, who have &s;ucceeded him upon the &s;ame title. No|thing is more u&s;ual, tho' nothing may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear more unrea&s;onable, than this way of thinking. Princes often <HI>&s;eem</HI> to acquire a right from their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as well as from their ance&s;tors; and a king, who during his life-time might ju&s;tly be deem'd an u&s;urper, will be regarded by po&s;terity as a lawful prince, becau&s;e he has had the good fortune to &s;ettle his family on the throne, and entirely change the antient form of government. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> is regarded as the fir&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> emperor; while <HI>Sylla</HI> and
<PB N="188" REF="197">
<HI>Marius,</HI> who&s;e titles were really the &s;ame as his, are treated as tyrants and u&s;urpers. Time and cu&s;tom give authority to all forms of government, and all &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of princes; and that power, which at fir&s;t was founded only on inju&s;tice and violence, becomes in time legal and obligatory. Nor does the mind re&s;t there; but returning back upon its foot&s;teps, transfers to their predece&s;&s;ors and ance&s;tors that right, which it naturally a&s;cribes to the po&s;terity, as being related to|gether, and united in the imagination. The pre&s;ent <HI>king</HI> of <HI>France</HI> makes <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> a more lawful prince than <HI>Cromwell;</HI> as the e&s;tabli&s;h'd liberty of the <HI>Dutch</HI> is no incon|&s;iderable apology for their ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd.</P>

<P>WHEN civil government has been e&s;tabli&s;h'd over the greate&s;t part of mankind, and different &s;ocieties have been form'd contiguous to each other, there ari&s;es a new &s;et of duties among the neighbour|ing &s;tates, &s;uitable to the nature of that commerce, which they carry on with each
<PB N="189" REF="198">
other. Political writers tell us, that in every kind of intercour&s;e, a body politic is to be con&s;ider'd as one per&s;on; and indeed this a&s;&s;ertion is &s;o far ju&s;t, that different nations, as well as private per&s;ons, require mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; at the &s;ame time that their &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and ambition are perpetual &s;ources of war and di&s;cord. But tho' nations in this particular re&s;emble individuals, yet as they are very different in other re&s;pects, no wonder they regulate them&s;elves by different maxims, and give ri&s;e to a new &s;et of rules, which we call <HI>the laws of nations.</HI> Under this head we may comprize the &s;acredne&s;s of the per&s;ons of amba&s;&s;adors, the declaration of war, the ab&s;taining from poi&s;on'd arms, with other duties of that kind, which are evidently calculated for the commerce, that is peculiar to different &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the&s;e rules be &s;uper-added to the laws of nature, the former do not en|tirely aboli&s;h the latter; and one may &s;afely affirm, that the three fundamental rules of ju&s;tice, the &s;tability of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, its tran&s;|ference by con&s;ent, and the performance of promi&s;es, are duties of princes, as well as of &s;ubjects. The &s;ame intere&s;t produces the &s;ame effect in both ca&s;es. Where po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has no &s;tability, there mu&s;t be perpetual
<PB N="190" REF="199">
war. Where property is not transferr'd by con&s;ent, there can be no commerce. Where promi&s;es are not ob&s;erv'd, there can be no leagues nor alliances. The advantages, therefore, of peace, commerce, and mutual &s;uccour, make us extend to different king|doms the &s;ame notions of ju&s;tice, which take place among individuals.</P>
<P>THERE is a maxim very current in the world, which few politicians are willing to avow, but which has been authoriz'd by the practice of all ages, <HI>that there is a &s;y&s;tem of morals calculated for princes, much more free than that which ought to govern private per&s;ons.</HI> 'Tis evident this is not to be under&s;tood of the le&s;&s;er <HI>extent</HI> of public duties and obligations; nor will any one be &s;o extravagant as to a&s;&s;ert, that the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties ought to have no force among princes. For as princes do actually form treaties among them&s;elves, they mu&s;t pro|po&s;e &s;ome advantage from the execution of them; and the pro&s;pect of &s;uch advantage for the future mu&s;t engage them to perform their part, and mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h that law of nature. The meaning, therefore, of this political maxim is, that tho' the morality of princes has the &s;ame <HI>extent,</HI> yet it has not the &s;ame <HI>force</HI> as that of private per&s;ons,
<PB N="191" REF="200">
and may lawfully be tran&s;gre&s;s'd from a more trivial motive. However &s;hocking &s;uch a propo&s;ition may appear to certain philo&s;ophers, 'twill be ea&s;y to defend it upon tho&s;e principles, by which we have ac|counted for the origin of ju&s;tice and equity.</P>
<P>WHEN men have found by experience, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ociety, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to maintain &s;ociety, while they give free cour&s;e to their appetites; &s;o urgent an intere&s;t quickly re&s;trains their actions, and impo&s;es an obligation to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules, which we call <HI>the laws of ju&s;tice.</HI> This obligation of intere&s;t re&s;ts not here; but by the nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, gives ri&s;e to the moral obli|gation of duty; while we approve of &s;uch actions as tend to the peace of &s;ociety, and di&s;approve of &s;uch as tend to its di&s;turbance. The &s;ame <HI>natural</HI> obligation of intere&s;t takes place among independent kingdoms, and gives ri&s;e to the &s;ame <HI>morality;</HI> &s;o that no one of ever &s;o corrupt morals will ap|prove of a prince, who voluntarily, and of his own accord, breaks his word, or violates any treaty. But here we may ob&s;erve, that tho' the intercour&s;e of different &s;tates be ad|vantageous, and even &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, yet it is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary nor advantageous as
<PB N="192" REF="201">
that among individuals, without which 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible for human nature ever to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Since, therefore, the <HI>natural</HI> obli|gation to ju&s;tice, among different &s;tates, is not &s;o &s;trong as among individuals, the <HI>mo|ral</HI> obligation, which ari&s;es from it, mu&s;t partake of its weakne&s;s; and we mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily give a greater indulgence to a prince or mini&s;ter, who deceives another; than to a private gentleman, who breaks his word of honour.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it be a&s;k'd, <HI>what proportion the&s;e two &s;pecies of morality bear to each other?</HI> I wou'd an&s;wer, that this is a que&s;tion, to which we can never give any preci&s;e an&s;wer; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to reduce to numbers the proportion, which we ought to fix betwixt them. One may &s;afely affirm, that this proportion finds it&s;elf, without any art or &s;tudy of men; as we may ob&s;erve on many other occa&s;ions. The practice of the world goes farther in teaching us the degrees of our duty, than the mo&s;t &s;ubtile philo&s;ophy, which was ever yet invented. And this may &s;erve as a convincing proof, that all men have an implicit notion of the foundation of tho&s;e moral rules concerning natural and civil ju|&s;tice, and are &s;en&s;ible, that they ari&s;e merely from human conventions, and from the in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="193" REF="202">
which we have in the pre&s;ervation of peace and order. For otherwi&s;e the dimi|nution of the intere&s;t wou'd never produce a relaxation of the morality, and reconcile us more ea&s;ily to any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of ju&s;tice among princes and republics, than in the private commerce of one &s;ubject with ano|ther.</P>

<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders the length and feeblene&s;s of human infancy, with the con|cern which both &s;exes naturally have for their offspring, will ea&s;ily perceive, that there mu&s;t be an union of male and female for the education of the young, and that this union mu&s;t be of con&s;iderable dura|tion. But in order to induce the men to impo&s;e on them&s;elves this re&s;traint, and un|dergo chearfully all the fatigues and expences, to which it &s;ubjects them, they mu&s;t be|lieve, that the children are their own, and that their natural in&s;tinct is not directed to a wrong object, when they give a loo&s;e to love and tenderne&s;s. Now if we examine
<PB N="195" REF="204" MS="y">
the &s;tructure of the human body, we &s;hall find, that this &s;ecurity is very difficult to be attain'd on our part; and that &s;ince, in the copulation of the &s;exes, the principle of generation goes from the man to the wo|man, an error may ea&s;ily take place on the &s;ide of the former, tho' it be utterly im|po&s;&s;ible with regard to the latter. From this trivial and anatomical ob&s;ervation is deriv'd that va&s;t difference betwixt the education and duties of the two &s;exes.</P>
<P>WERE a philo&s;opher to examine the matter <HI>a priori,</HI> he wou'd rea&s;on after the following manner. Men are induc'd to la|bour for the maintenance and education of their children, by the per&s;ua&s;ion that they are really their own; and therefore 'tis rea|&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;ary, to give them &s;ome &s;ecurity in this particular. This &s;ecu|rity cannot con&s;i&s;t entirely in the impo&s;ing of &s;evere puni&s;hments on any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; &s;ince the&s;e public puni&s;hments cannot be inflicted without legal proof, which 'tis diffi|cult to meet with in this &s;ubject. What re&s;traint, therefore, &s;hall we impo&s;e on wo|men, in order to counter-balance &s;o &s;trong a temptation as they have to fidelity? There &s;eems to be no re&s;traint po&s;&s;ible, but in the
<PB N="196" REF="205">
puni&s;hment of bad fame or reputation; a puni&s;hment, which has a mighty influence on the human mind, and at the &s;ame time is inflicted by the world upon &s;urmizes, and conjectures, and proofs, that wou'd never be receiv'd in any court of judicature. In order, therefore, to impo&s;e a due re&s;traint on the female &s;ex, we mu&s;t attach a pecu|liar degree of &s;hame to their infidelity, above what ari&s;es merely from its inju&s;tice, and mu&s;t be&s;tow proportionable prai&s;es on their cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this be a very &s;trong motive to fidelity, our philo&s;opher wou'd quickly di&s;|cover, that it wou'd not alone be &s;ufficient to that purpo&s;e. All human creatures, e&s;pe|cially of the female &s;ex, are apt to over-look remote motives in favour of any pre&s;ent temptation: The temptation is here the &s;tronge&s;t imaginable: Its approaches are in|&s;en&s;ible and &s;educing: And a woman ea&s;ily finds, or flatters her&s;elf &s;he &s;hall find, cer|tain means of &s;ecuring her reputation, and preventing all the pernicious con&s;equences of her plea&s;ures. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that, be&s;ide the infamy attending &s;uch licences, there &s;hou'd be &s;ome preceding backwardne&s;s or dread, which may prevent their fir&s;t ap|proaches, and may give the female &s;ex a
<PB N="197" REF="206">
repugnance to all expre&s;&s;ions, and po&s;tures, and liberties, that have an immediate rela|tion to that enjoyment.</P>
<P>SUCH wou'd be the rea&s;onings of our &s;peculative philo&s;opher: But I am per&s;uaded, that if he had not a perfect knowledge of human nature, he wou'd be apt to regard them as mere chimerical &s;peculations, and wou'd con&s;ider the infamy attending infide|lity, and backwardne&s;s to all its approaches, as principles that were rather to be wi&s;h'd than hop'd for in the world. For what means, wou'd he &s;ay, of per&s;uading man|kind, that the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of conjugal duty are more infamous than any other kind of inju&s;tice, when 'tis evident they are more excu&s;able, upon account of the greatne&s;s of the temptation? And what po&s;&s;ibility of giving a backwardne&s;s to the approaches of a plea&s;ure, to which nature has in&s;pir'd &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity; and a propen&s;ity that 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the end to comply with, for the &s;upport of the &s;pecies?</P>
<P>BUT &s;peculative rea&s;onings, which co&s;t &s;o much pains to philo&s;ophers, are often form'd by the world naturally, and without reflection: As difficulties, which &s;eem un|&s;urmountable in theory, are ea&s;ily got over in practice. Tho&s;e, who have an intere&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="207" MS="y">
in the fidelity of women, naturally di&s;|approve of their infidelity, and all the ap|proaches to it. Tho&s;e, who have no in|tere&s;t, are carried along with the &s;tream. Education takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ductile minds of the fair &s;ex in their infancy. And when a general rule of this kind is once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, men are apt to extend it beyond tho&s;e principles, from which it fir&s;t aro&s;e. Thus batchelors, however debauch'd, cannot chu&s;e but be &s;hock'd with any in&s;tance of lewdne&s;s or impudence in women. And tho' all the&s;e maxims have a plain reference to generation, yet women pa&s;t child-bearing have no more privilege in this re&s;pect, than tho&s;e who are in the flower of their youth and beauty. Men have undoubtedly an im|plicit notion, that all tho&s;e ideas of mode&s;ty and decency have a regard to generation; &s;ince they impo&s;e not the &s;ame laws, <HI>with the &s;ame force,</HI> on the male &s;ex, where that rea&s;on takes not place. The exception is there obvious and exten&s;ive, and founded on a remarkable difference, which produces a clear &s;eparation and disjunction of ideas. But as the ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with regard to the different ages of women, for this rea&s;on, tho' men know, that the&s;e notions are founded on the public intere&s;t, yet the
<PB N="199" REF="208">
general rule carries us beyond the original principle, and makes us extend the notions of mode&s;ty over the whole &s;ex, from their earlie&s;t infancy to their extreme&s;t old-age and infirmity.</P>
<P>COURAGE, which is the point of honour among men, derives its merit, in a great mea&s;ure, from artifice, as well as the cha&s;tity of women; tho' it has al&s;o &s;ome foundation in nature, as we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards.</P>
<P>AS to the obligations which the male &s;ex lie under, with regard to cha&s;tity, we may ob&s;erve, that according to the general notions of the world, they bear nearly the &s;ame proportion to the obligations of women, as the obligations of the law of nations do to tho&s;e of the law of nature. 'Tis con|trary to the intere&s;t of civil &s;ociety, that men &s;hou'd have an <HI>entire</HI> liberty of in|dulging their appetites in venereal enjoyment: But as this intere&s;t is weaker than in the ca&s;e of the female &s;ex, the moral obligation, ari&s;ing from it, mu&s;t be proportionably weaker. And to prove this we need only appeal to the practice and &s;entiments of all nations and ages.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. <HI>Of the other virtues and vices.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. <HI>Of the origin of the natural virtues and vices.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the examination of &s;uch virtues and vices as are entirely natural, and have no dependance on the ar|tifice and contrivance of men. The exami|nation of the&s;e will conclude this &s;y&s;tem of morals.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;pring or actuating principle of the human mind is plea&s;ure or pain; and when the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are remov'd, both from our thought and feeling, we are, in a great mea&s;ure, incapable of pa&s;&s;ion or action, of de&s;ire or volition. The mo&s;t immediate effects of plea&s;ure and pain are the propen&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="210">
and aver&s;e motions of the mind; which are diver&s;ified into volition, into de&s;ire and aver|&s;ion, grief and joy, hope and fear, accord|ing as the plea&s;ure or pain changes its &s;itu|ation, and becomes probable or improbable, certain or uncertain, or is con&s;ider'd as out of our power for the pre&s;ent moment. But when along with this, the objects, that cau&s;e plea&s;ure or pain, acquire a relation to our|&s;elves or others; they &s;till continue to excite de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, grief and joy: But cau&s;e, at the &s;ame time, the indirect pa&s;&s;ions of pride or humility, love or hatred, which in this ca&s;e have a double relation of im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas to the pain or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erv'd, that moral di&s;tinctions depend entirely on certain pe|culiar &s;entiments of pain and plea&s;ure, and that whatever mental quality in our&s;elves or others gives us a &s;atisfaction, by the &s;urvey or reflection, is of cour&s;e virtuous; as every thing of this nature, that gives unea&s;ine&s;s, is vicious. Now &s;ince every quality in our|&s;elves or others, which gives plea&s;ure, al|ways cau&s;es pride or love; as every one, that produces unea&s;ine&s;s, excites humility or ha|tred: It follows, that the&s;e two particulars are to be con&s;ider'd as equivalent, with regard to our mental qualities, <HI>virtue</HI> and the power
<PB N="203" REF="211">
of producing love or pride, <HI>vice</HI> and the power of producing humility or hatred. In every ca&s;e, therefore, we mu&s;t judge of the one by the other; and may pronounce any <HI>quality</HI> of the mind virtuous, which cau&s;es love or pride; and any one vicious, which cau&s;es hatred or humility.</P>
<P>IF any <HI>action</HI> be either virtuous or vicious, 'tis only as a &s;ign of &s;ome quality or cha|racter. It mu&s;t depend upon durable prin|ciples of the mind, which extend over the whole conduct, and enter into the per&s;onal character. Actions them&s;elves, not proceed|ing from any con&s;tant principle, have no influence on love or hatred, pride or humi|mility; and con&s;equently are never con|&s;ider'd in morality.</P>
<P>THIS reflection is &s;elf-evident, and de|&s;erves to be attended to, as being of the ut|mo&s;t importance in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. We are never to con&s;ider any &s;ingle action in our enquiries concerning the origin of morals; but only the quality or character from which the action proceeded. The&s;e alone are <HI>dura|ble</HI> enough to affect our &s;entiments concern|ing the per&s;on. Actions are, indeed, better indications of a character than words, or even wi&s;hes and &s;entiments; but 'tis only &s;o far as they are &s;uch indications, that they
<PB N="204" REF="212">
are attended with love or hatred, prai&s;e or blame.</P>
<P>TO di&s;cover the true origin of morals, and of that love or hatred, which ari&s;es from mental qualities, we mu&s;t take the matter pretty deep, and compare &s;ome principles, which have been already examin'd and ex|plain'd.</P>
<P>WE may begin with con&s;idering a-new the nature and force of <HI>&s;ympathy.</HI> The minds of all men are &s;imilar in their feelings and operations; nor can any one be actuated by any affection, of which all others are not, in &s;ome degree, &s;u&s;ceptible. As in &s;trings equally wound up, the motion of one communicates it&s;elf to the re&s;t; &s;o all the affections readily pa&s;s from one per&s;on to another, and beget corre&s;pondent move|ments in every human creature. When I &s;ee the <HI>effects</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion in the voice and ge&s;ture of any per&s;on, my mind imme|diately pa&s;&s;es from the&s;e effects to their cau&s;es, and forms &s;uch a lively idea of the pa&s;&s;ion, as is pre&s;ently converted into the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf. In like manner, when I per|ceive the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of any emotion, my mind is convey'd to the effects, and is actuated with a like emotion. Were I pre&s;ent at any of the more terrible operations of &s;urgery,
<PB N="205" REF="213">
'tis certain, that even before it begun, the preparation of the in&s;truments, the laying of the bandages in order, the heating of the irons, with all the &s;igns of anxiety and con|cern in the patient and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, wou'd have a great effect upon my mind, and excite the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of pity and terror. No pa&s;&s;ion of another di&s;covers it&s;elf immedi|ately to the mind. We are only &s;en&s;ible of its cau&s;es or effects. From <HI>the&s;e</HI> we in|fer the pa&s;&s;ion: And con&s;equently <HI>the&s;e</HI> give ri&s;e to our &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>OUR &s;en&s;e of beauty depends very much on this principle; and where any object has a tendency to produce plea&s;ure in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it is always regarded as beautiful; as every object, that has a tendency to produce pain, is di&s;agreeable and deform'd. Thus the con|veniency of a hou&s;e, the fertility of a field, the &s;trength of a hor&s;e, the capacity, &s;ecu|rity, and &s;wift-&s;ailing of a ve&s;&s;el, form the principal beauty of the&s;e &s;everal objects. Here the object, which is denominated beau|tiful, plea&s;es only by its tendency to pro|duce a certain effect. That effect is the plea&s;ure or advantage of &s;ome other per&s;on. Now the plea&s;ure of a &s;tranger, for whom we have no friend&s;hip, plea&s;es us only by &s;ympathy. To this principle, therefore, is
<PB N="206" REF="214">
owing the beauty, which we find in every thing that is u&s;eful. How con&s;iderable a part this is of beauty will ea&s;ily appear upon reflection. Wherever an object has a ten|dency to produce plea&s;ure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or in other words, is the proper <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of plea&s;ure, it is &s;ure to plea&s;e the &s;pectator, by a delicate &s;ympathy with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Mo&s;t of the works of art are e&s;teem'd beau|tiful, in proportion to their fitne&s;s for the u&s;e of man, and even many of the pro|ductions of nature derive their beauty from that &s;ource. Hand&s;ome and beautiful, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, is not an ab&s;olute but a re|lative quality, and plea&s;es us by nothing but its tendency to produce an end that is agreeable <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Decentior equus cujus a&s;tricta &s;unt ilia; &s;ed idem velocior.

Sed hoc quidem di&s;cernere, modici judicii e&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Quinct.</HI> lib. 8.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle produces, in many in|&s;tances, our &s;entiments of morals, as well as tho&s;e of beauty. No virtue is more e&s;teem'd than ju&s;tice, and no vice more dete&s;ted than inju&s;tice; nor are there any qualities, which go farther to the fixing the character, either as amiable or odious. Now ju&s;tice is a mo|ral virtue, merely becau&s;e it has that tendency
<PB N="207" REF="215" MS="y">
to the good of mankind; and, indeed, is no|thing but an artificial invention to that pur|po&s;e. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of allegiance, of the laws of nations, of mode&s;ty, and of good-manners. All the&s;e are mere human contrivances for the intere&s;t of &s;ociety. And &s;ince there is a very &s;trong &s;entiment of mo|rals, which, in all nations, and all ages, has attended them, we mu&s;t allow, that the re|flecting on the tendency of characters and mental qualities, is &s;ufficient to give us the &s;entiments of approbation and blame. Now as the means to an end can only be agree|able, where the end is agreeable; and as the good of &s;ociety, where our own intere&s;t is not concern'd, or that of our friends, plea&s;es only by &s;ympathy: It follows, that &s;ympa|thy is the &s;ource of the e&s;teem, which we pay to all the artificial virtues.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, <HI>that</HI> &s;ympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature, <HI>that</HI> it has a great influence on our ta&s;te of beauty, and <HI>that</HI> it produces our &s;entiment of morals in all the artificial virtues. From thence we may pre&s;ume, that it al&s;o gives ri&s;e to many of the other virtues; and that quali|ties acquire our approbation, becau&s;e of their tendency to the good of mankind. This pre|&s;umption mu&s;t become a certainty, when we
<PB N="208" REF="216">
find that mo&s;t of tho&s;e qualities, which we <HI>naturally</HI> approve of, have actually that ten|dency, and render a man a proper member of &s;ociety: While the qualities, which we <HI>naturally</HI> di&s;approve of, have a contrary ten|dency, and render any intercour&s;e with the per&s;on dangerous or di&s;agreeable. For hav|ing found, that &s;uch tendencies have force enough to produce the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiment of morals, we can never rea&s;onably, in the&s;e ca&s;es, look for any other cau&s;e of approba|tion or blame; it being an inviolable maxim in philo&s;ophy, that where any particular cau&s;e is &s;ufficient for an effect, we ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied with it, and ought not to multiply cau&s;es without nece&s;&s;ity. We have happily attain'd experiments in the artificial virtues, where the tendency of qualities to the good of &s;ociety, is the <HI>&s;ole</HI> cau&s;e of our approba|tion, without any &s;u&s;picion of the concur|rence of another principle. From thence we learn the force of that principle. And where that principle may take place, and the qua|lity approv'd of is really beneficial to &s;ociety, a true philo&s;opher will never require any other principle to account for the &s;tronge&s;t appro|bation and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THAT many of the natural virtues have this tendency to the good of &s;ociety, no one
<PB N="209" REF="217">
can doubt of. Meekne&s;s, beneficence, cha|rity, genero&s;ity, clemency, moderation, equi|ty, bear the greate&s;t figure among the moral qualities, and are commonly denominated the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> virtues, to mark their tendency to the good of &s;ociety. This goes &s;o far, that &s;ome philo&s;ophers have repre&s;ented all moral di&s;tinctions as the effect of artifice and edu|cation, when &s;kilful politicians endeavour'd to re&s;train the turbulent pa&s;&s;ions of men, and make them operate to the public good, by the notions of honour and &s;hame. This &s;y|&s;tem, however, is not con&s;i&s;tent with ex|perience. For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> there are other virtues and vices be&s;ide tho&s;e which have this ten|dency to the public advantage and lo&s;s. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> had not men a natural &s;entiment of approbation and blame, it cou'd never be ex|cited by politicians; nor wou'd the words <HI>laudable</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e-worthy, blameable</HI> and <HI>odious,</HI> be any more intelligible, than if they were a language perfectly unknown to us, as we have already ob&s;erv'd. But tho' this &s;y|&s;tem be erroneous, it may teach us, that mo|ral di&s;tinctions ari&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, from the tendency of qualities and characters to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and that 'tis our con|cern for that intere&s;t, which makes us ap|prove or di&s;approve of them. Now we
<PB N="210" REF="218">
have no &s;uch exten&s;ive concern for &s;ociety but from &s;ympathy; and con&s;equently 'tis that principle, which takes us &s;o far out of our|&s;elves, as to give us the &s;ame plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s in the characters of others, as if they had a tendency to our own advantage or lo&s;s.</P>
<P>THE only difference betwixt the natural virtues and ju&s;tice lies in this, that the good, which re&s;ults from the former, ari&s;es from every &s;ingle act, and is the object of &s;ome natural pa&s;&s;ion: Whereas a &s;ingle act of ju&s;tice, con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, may often be contrary to the public good; and 'tis only the concurrence of mankind, in a general &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem of action, which is advan|tageous. When I relieve per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s, my natural humanity is my motive; and &s;o far as my &s;uccour extends, &s;o far have I promoted the happine&s;s of my fellow-crea|tures. But if we examine all the que&s;tions, that come before any tribunal of ju&s;tice, we &s;hall find, that, con&s;idering each ca&s;e apart, it wou'd as often be an in&s;tance of humanity to decide contrary to the laws of ju&s;tice as conformable them. Judges take from a poor man to give to a rich; they be&s;tow on the di&s;&s;olute the labour of the indu&s;trious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means
<PB N="211" REF="219">
of harming both them&s;elves and others. The whole &s;cheme, however, of law and ju&s;tice is advantageous to the &s;ociety; and 'twas with a view to this advantage, that men, by their voluntary conventions, e&s;tab|li&s;h'd it. After it is once e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the&s;e conventions, it is <HI>naturally</HI> attended with a &s;trong &s;entiment of morals; which can proceed from nothing but our &s;ympathy with the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. We need no other explication of that e&s;teem, which at|tends &s;uch of the natural virtues, as have a tendency to the public good.</P>
<P>I MUST farther add, that there are &s;everal circum&s;tances, which render this hypothe&s;is much more probable with regard to the natural than the artificial virtues. 'Tis cer|tain, that the imagination is more affected by what is particular, than by what is gene|ral; and that the &s;entiments are always mov'd with difficulty, where their objects are, in any degree, loo&s;e and undetermin'd: Now every particular act of ju&s;tice is not beneficial to &s;ociety, but the whole &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem: And it may not, perhaps, be any individual per&s;on, for whom we are concern'd, who receives benefit from ju&s;tice, but the whole &s;ociety alike. On the con|trary, every particular act of genero&s;ity, or
<PB N="212" REF="220">
relief of the indu&s;trious and indigent, is beneficial; and is beneficial to a particular per&s;on, who is not unde&s;erving of it. 'Tis more natural, therefore, to think, that the tendencies of the latter virtue will affect our &s;entiments, and command our approbation, than tho&s;e of the former; and therefore, &s;ince we find, that the approbation of the former ari&s;es from their tendencies, we may a&s;cribe, with better rea&s;on, the &s;ame cau&s;e to the approbation of the latter. In any number of &s;imilar effects, if a cau&s;e can be di&s;cover'd for one, we ought to extend that cau&s;e to all the other effects, which can be accounted for by it: But much more, if the&s;e other effects be attended with peculiar circum&s;tances, which facilitate the operation of that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed farther, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve two remarkable circum&s;tances in this affair, which may &s;eem objections to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. The fir&s;t may be thus ex|plain'd. When any quality, or character, has a tendency to the good of mankind, we are pleas'd with it, and approve of it; be|cau&s;e it pre&s;ents the lively idea of plea&s;ure; which idea affects us by &s;ympathy, and is it&s;elf a kind of plea&s;ure. But as this &s;ym|pathy is very variable, it may be thought,
<PB N="213" REF="221">
that our &s;entiments of morals mu&s;t admit of all the &s;ame variations. We &s;ympathize more with per&s;ons contiguous to us, than with per&s;ons remote from us: With our acquaint|ance, than with &s;trangers: With our coun|trymen, than with foreigners. But notwith|&s;tanding this variation of our &s;ympathy, we give the &s;ame approbation to the &s;ame moral qualities in <HI>China</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI> They appear equally virtuous, and recommend them&s;elves equally to the e&s;teem of a judi|cious &s;pectator. The &s;ympathy varies with|out a variation in our e&s;teem. Our e&s;teem, therefore, proceeds not from &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer: The approbation of moral qualities mo&s;t certainly is not deriv'd from rea&s;on, or any compari&s;on of ideas; but proceeds entirely from a moral ta&s;te, and from certain &s;entiments of plea&s;ure or di&s;|gu&s;t, which ari&s;e upon the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters. Now 'tis evident, that tho&s;e &s;entiments, whence-ever they are deriv'd, mu&s;t vary according to the di&s;tance or contiguity of the objects; nor can I feel the &s;ame lively plea&s;ure from the virtues of a per&s;on, who liv'd in <HI>Greece</HI> two thou&s;and years ago, that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance. Yet I do not &s;ay, that I
<PB N="214" REF="222">
e&s;teem the one more than the other: And therefore, if the variation of the &s;entiment, without a variation of the e&s;teem, be an objection, it mu&s;t have equal force again&s;t every other &s;y&s;tem, as again&s;t that of &s;ym|pathy. But to con&s;ider the matter a-right, it has no force at all; and 'tis the ea&s;ie&s;t matter in the world to account for it. Our &s;ituation, with regard both to per&s;ons and things, is in continual fluctuation; and a man, that lies at a di&s;tance from us, may, in a little time, become a familiar acquaint|ance. Be&s;ides, every particular man has a peculiar po&s;ition with regard to others; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we cou'd ever conver&s;e toge|ther on any rea&s;onable terms, were each of us to con&s;ider characters and per&s;ons, only as they appear from his peculiar point of view. In order, therefore, to prevent tho&s;e con|tinual <HI>contradictions,</HI> and arrive at a more <HI>&s;table</HI> judgment of things, we fix on &s;ome <HI>&s;teady</HI> and <HI>general</HI> points of view; and al|ways, in our thoughts, place our&s;elves in them, whatever may be our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. In like manner, external beauty is deter|min'd merely by plea&s;ure; and 'tis evident, a beautiful countenance cannot give &s;o much plea&s;ure, when &s;een at the di&s;tance of twenty paces, as when it is brought nearer us. We
<PB N="215" REF="223">
&s;ay not, however, that it appears to us le&s;s beautiful: Becau&s;e we know what effect it will have in &s;uch a po&s;ition, and by that reflection we correct its momentary ap|pearance.</P>
<P>IN general, all &s;entiments of blame or prai&s;e are variable, according to our &s;itua|tion of nearne&s;s or remotene&s;s, with regard to the per&s;on blam'd or prais'd, and accord|ing to the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of our mind. But the&s;e variations we regard not in our ge|neral deci&s;ions, but &s;till apply the terms expre&s;&s;ive of our liking or di&s;like, in the &s;ame manner, as if we remain'd in one point of view. Experience &s;oon teaches us this method of correcting our &s;entiments, or at lea&s;t, of correcting our language, where the &s;entiments are more &s;tubborn and inalterable. Our &s;ervant, if diligent and faithful, may excite &s;tronger &s;entiments of love and kind|ne&s;s than <HI>Marcus Brutus,</HI> as repre&s;ented in hi&s;tory; but we &s;ay not upon that ac|count, that the former character is more laudable than the latter. We know, that were we to approach equally near to that renown'd patriot, he wou'd command a much higher degree of affection and admiration. Such corrections are common with regard to all the &s;en&s;es; and indeed 'twere impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="216" REF="224">
we cou'd ever make u&s;e of language, or communicate our &s;entiments to one another, did we not correct the momentary appear|ances of things, and overlook our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore from the influence of cha|racters and qualities, upon tho&s;e who have an intercour&s;e with any per&s;on, that we blame or prai&s;e him. We con&s;ider not whether the per&s;ons, affected by the qualities, be our acquaintance or &s;trangers, country|men or foreigners. Nay, we over-look our own intere&s;t in tho&s;e general judgments; and blame not a man for oppo&s;ing us in any of our preten&s;ions, when his own intere&s;t is particularly concern'd. We make allowance for a certain degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in men; becau&s;e we know it to be in&s;eparable from human nature, and inherent in our frame and con&s;titution. By this reflection we cor|rect tho&s;e &s;entiments of blame, which &s;o naturally ari&s;e upon any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>BUT however the general principle of our blame or prai&s;e may be corrected by tho&s;e other principles, 'tis certain, they are not altogether efficacious, nor do our pa&s;|&s;ions often corre&s;pond entirely to the pre&s;ent theory. 'Tis &s;eldom men heartily love what lies at a di&s;tance from them, and what no
<PB N="217" REF="225">
way redounds to their particular benefit; as 'tis no le&s;s rare to meet with per&s;ons, who can pardon another any oppo&s;ition he makes to their intere&s;t, however ju&s;tifiable that op|po&s;ition may be by the general rules of mo|rality. Here we are contented with &s;aying, that rea&s;on requires &s;uch an impartial con|duct, but that 'tis &s;eldom we can bring our|&s;elves to it, and that our pa&s;&s;ions do not readily follow the determination of our judg|ment. This language will be ea&s;ily under|&s;tood, if we con&s;ider what we formerly &s;aid concerning that <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is able to op|po&s;e our pa&s;&s;ion; and which we have found to be nothing but a general calm determina|tion of the pa&s;&s;ions, founded on &s;ome di&s;tant view or reflection. When we form our judgments of per&s;ons, merely from the ten|dency of their characters to our own bene|fit, or to that of our friends, we find &s;o many contradictions to our &s;entiments in &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, and &s;uch an uncer|tainty from the ince&s;&s;ant changes of our &s;itu|ation, that we &s;eek &s;ome other &s;tandard of merit and demerit, which may not admit of &s;o great variation. Being thus loo&s;en'd from our fir&s;t &s;tation, we cannot afterwards fix our&s;elves &s;o commodiou&s;ly by any means as by a &s;ympathy with tho&s;e, who have any
<PB N="218" REF="226">
commerce with the per&s;on we con&s;ider. This is far from being as lively as when our own intere&s;t is concern'd, or that of our parti|cular friends; nor has it &s;uch an influence on our love and hatred: But being equally conformable to our calm and general princi|ples, 'tis &s;aid to have an equal authority over our rea&s;on, and to command our judgment and opinion. We blame equally a bad action, which we read of in hi&s;tory, with one perform'd in our neighbourhood t'other day: The meaning of which is, that we know from reflection, that the former action wou'd excite as &s;trong &s;entiments of di&s;ap|probation as the latter, were it plac'd in the &s;ame po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> remarkable circum&s;tance, which I propos'd to take no|tice of. Where a per&s;on is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a character, that in its natural tendency is beneficial to &s;ociety, we e&s;teem him virtuous, and are delighted with the view of his cha|racter, even tho' particular accidents prevent its operation, and incapacitate him from be|ing &s;erviceable to his friends and country. Virtue in rags is &s;till virtue; and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or de&s;art, where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lo&s;t to
<PB N="219" REF="227">
all the world. Now this may be e&s;teem'd an objection to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. Sympa|thy intere&s;ts us in the good of mankind; and if &s;ympathy were the &s;ource of our e&s;teem for virtue, that &s;entiment of appro|bation cou'd only take place, where the virtue actually attain'd its end, and was bene|ficial to mankind. Where it fails of its end, 'tis only an imperfect means; and there|fore can never acquire any merit from that end. The goodne&s;s of an end can be&s;tow a merit on &s;uch means alone as are com|pleat, and actually produce the end.</P>
<P>To this we may reply, that where any object, in all its parts, is fitted to attain any agreeable end, it naturally gives us plea&s;ure, and is e&s;teem'd beautiful, even tho' &s;ome ex|ternal circum&s;tances be wanting to render it altogether effectual. 'Tis &s;ufficient if every thing be compleat in the object it&s;elf. A hou&s;e, that is contriv'd with great judgment for all the commodities of life, plea&s;es us upon that account; tho' perhaps we are &s;en|&s;ible, that no-one will ever dwell in it. A fertile &s;oil, and a happy climate, delight us by a reflection on the happine&s;s which they wou'd afford the inhabitants, tho' at pre&s;ent the country be de&s;art and uninhabited. A man, who&s;e limbs and &s;hape promi&s;e &s;trength
<PB N="220" REF="228">
and activity, is e&s;teem'd hand&s;ome, tho' condemn'd to perpetual impri&s;onment. The imagination has a &s;et of pa&s;&s;ions belonging to it, upon which our &s;entiments of beauty much depend. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are mov'd by degrees of liveline&s;s and &s;trength, which are inferior to <HI>belief,</HI> and independent of the real exi&s;tence of their objects. Where a character is, in every re&s;pect, fitted to be beneficial to &s;ociety, the imagination pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily from the cau&s;e to the effect, without con&s;idering that there are &s;till &s;ome circum&s;tances want|ing to render the cau&s;e a compleat one. <HI>General rules</HI> create a &s;pecies of probability, which &s;ometimes influences the judgment, and always the imagination.</P>
<P>'TIS true, when the cau&s;e is compleat, and a good di&s;po&s;ition is attended with good fortune, which renders it really beneficial to &s;ociety, it gives a &s;tronger plea&s;ure to the &s;pectator, and is attended with a more lively &s;ympathy. We are more affected by it; and yet we do not &s;ay that it is more vir|tuous, or that we e&s;teem it more. We know, that an alteration of fortune may render the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition entirely im|potent; and therefore we &s;eparate, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the fortune from the di&s;po&s;ition. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame, as when we correct
<PB N="221" REF="229">
the different &s;entiments of virtue, which pro|ceed from its different di&s;tances from our|&s;elves. The pa&s;&s;ions do not always follow our corrections; but the&s;e corrections &s;erve &s;ufficiently to regulate our ab&s;tract notions, and are alone regarded, when we pronounce in general concerning the degrees of vice and virtue.</P>
<P>'TIS ob&s;erv'd by critics, that all words or &s;entences, which are difficult to the pro|nunciation, are di&s;agreeable to the ear. There is no difference, whether a man hear them pronounc'd, or read them &s;ilently to him&s;elf. When I run over a book with my eye, I imagine I hear it all; and al&s;o, by the force of imagination, enter into the unea&s;ine&s;s, which the delivery of it wou'd give the &s;peaker. The unea&s;ine&s;s is not real; but as &s;uch a compo&s;ition of words has a natu|ral tendency to produce it, this is &s;ufficient to affect the mind with a painful &s;entiment, and render the di&s;cour&s;e har&s;h and di&s;agree|able. 'Tis a &s;imilar ca&s;e, where any real quality is, by accidental circum&s;tances, ren|der'd impotent, and is depriv'd of its natural influence on &s;ociety.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e principles we may ea&s;ily re|move any contradiction, which may appear to be betwixt the <HI>exten&s;ive &s;ympathy,</HI> on
<PB N="222" REF="230">
which our &s;entiments of virtue depend, and that <HI>limited genero&s;ity</HI> which I have fre|quently ob&s;erv'd to be natural to men, and which ju&s;tice and property &s;uppo&s;e, accord|ing to the precedent rea&s;oning. My &s;ym|pathy with another may give me the &s;en|timent of pain and di&s;approbation, when any object is pre&s;ented, that has a tendency to give him unea&s;ine&s;s; tho' I may not be willing to &s;acrifice any thing of my own in|tere&s;t, or cro&s;s any of my pa&s;&s;ions, for his &s;atisfaction. A hou&s;e may di&s;plea&s;e me by being ill-contriv'd for the convenience of the owner; and yet I may refu&s;e to give a &s;hil|ling towards the rebuilding of it. Senti|ments mu&s;t touch the heart, to make them controul our pa&s;&s;ions: But they need not extend beyond the imagination, to make them influence our ta&s;te. When a building &s;eems clum&s;y and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and di&s;agreeable; tho' we be fully a&s;&s;ur'd of the &s;olidity of the workman&s;hip. 'Tis a kind of fear, which cau&s;es this &s;en|timent of di&s;approbation; but the pa&s;&s;ion is not the &s;ame with that which we feel, when oblig'd to &s;tand under a wall, that we really think tottering and in&s;ecure. The <HI>&s;eeming tendencies</HI> of objects affect the mind: And the emotions they excite are of a like
<PB N="223" REF="231">
&s;pecies with tho&s;e, which proceed from the <HI>real con&s;equences</HI> of objects, but their feeling is different. Nay, the&s;e emotions are &s;o dif|ferent in their feeling, that they may often be contrary, without de&s;troying each other; as when the fortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are e&s;teem'd beautiful upon ac|count of their &s;trength, tho' we cou'd wi&s;h that they were entirely de&s;troy'd. The imagination adheres to the <HI>general</HI> views of things, and di&s;tingui&s;hes the feelings they produce, from tho&s;e which ari&s;e from our particular and momentary &s;ituation.</P>
<P>IF we examine the panegyrics that are commonly made of great men, we &s;hall find, that mo&s;t of the qualities, which are attributed to them, may be divided into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as make them perform their part in &s;ociety; and &s;uch as render them &s;erviceable to them&s;elves, and enable them to promote their own intere&s;t. Their <HI>pru|dence, temperance, frugality, indu&s;try, a&s;&s;i|duity, enterprize, dexterity,</HI> are celebrated, as well as their <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI> If we ever give an indulgence to any quality, that di&s;ables a man from making a figure in life, 'tis to that of <HI>indolence,</HI> which is not &s;uppos'd to deprive one of his parts and ca|pacity,
<PB N="224" REF="232">
but only &s;u&s;pends their exerci&s;e; and that without any inconvenience to the per|&s;on him&s;elf, &s;ince 'tis, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from his own choice. Yet indolence is al|ways allow'd to be a fault, and a very great one, if extreme: Nor do a man's friends ever acknowledge him to be &s;ubject to it, but in order to &s;ave his character in more material articles. He cou'd make a figure, &s;ay they, if he pleas'd to give application: His under&s;tanding is &s;ound, his conception quick, and his memory tenacious; but he hates bu&s;ine&s;s, and is indifferent about his fortune. And this a man &s;ometimes may make even a &s;ubject of vanity; tho' with the air of confe&s;&s;ing a fault: Becau&s;e he may think, that this incapacity for bu&s;ine&s;s implies much more noble qualities; &s;uch as a philo&s;ophical &s;pirit, a fine ta&s;te, a delicate wit, or a reli&s;h for plea&s;ure and &s;ociety. But take any other ca&s;e: Suppo&s;e a quality, that without being an indication of any other good qualities, incapacitates a man <HI>always</HI> for bu&s;ine&s;s, and is de&s;tructive to his intere&s;t; &s;uch as a blundering under&s;tanding, and a wrong judgment of every thing in life; in|con&s;tancy and irre&s;olution; or a want of addre&s;s in the management of men and bu&s;i|ne&s;s: The&s;e are all allow'd to be imperfec|tions
<PB N="225" REF="233">
in a character; and many men wou'd rather acknowledge the greate&s;t crimes, than have it &s;u&s;pected, that they are, in any de|gree, &s;ubject to them.</P>
<P>'TIS very happy, in our philo&s;ophical re|&s;earches, when we find the &s;ame phaenome|non diver&s;ified by a variety of circum&s;tances; and by di&s;covering what is common among them, can the better a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves of the truth of any hypothe&s;is we may make u&s;e of to explain it. Were nothing e&s;teem'd virtue but what were beneficial to &s;ociety, I am per&s;uaded, that the foregoing explication of the moral &s;en&s;e ought &s;till to be receiv'd, and that upon &s;ufficient evidence: But this evidence mu&s;t grow upon us, when we find other kinds of virtue, which will not ad|mit of any explication except from that hypothe&s;is. Here is a man, who is not re|markably defective in his &s;ocial qualities; but what principally recommends him is his dexterity in bu&s;ine&s;s, by which he has extricated him&s;elf from the greate&s;t difficul|ties, and conducted the mo&s;t delicate affairs with a &s;ingular addre&s;s and prudence. I find an e&s;teem for him immediately to ari&s;e in me: His company is a &s;atisfaction to me; and before I have any farther acquaintance with him, I wou'd rather do him a &s;ervice
<PB N="226" REF="234">
than another, who&s;e character is in every other re&s;pect equal, but is deficient in that particular. In this ca&s;e, the qualities that plea&s;e me are all con&s;ider'd as u&s;eful to the per&s;on, and as having a tendency to pro|mote his intere&s;t and &s;atisfaction. They are only regarded as means to an end, and plea&s;e me in proportion to their fitne&s;s for that end. The end, therefore, mu&s;t be agree|able to me. But what makes the end agree|able? The per&s;on is a &s;tranger: I am no way intere&s;ted in him, nor lie under any obligation to him: His happine&s;s concerns not me, farther than the happine&s;s of every human, and indeed of every &s;en&s;ible crea|ture: That is, it affects me only by &s;ym|pathy. From that principle, whenever I di&s;cover his happine&s;s and good, whether in its cau&s;es or effects, I enter &s;o deeply into it, that it gives me a &s;en&s;ible emotion. The appearance of qualities, that have a <HI>tendency</HI> to promote it, have an agreeable effect upon my imagination, and command my love and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THIS theory may &s;erve to explain, why the &s;ame qualities, in all ca&s;es, produce both pride and love, humility and hatred; and the &s;ame man is always virtuous or vicious, accompli&s;h'd or de&s;picable to others,
<PB N="227" REF="235">
who is &s;o to him&s;elf. A per&s;on, in whom we di&s;cover any pa&s;&s;ion or habit, which ori|ginally is only incommodious to him&s;elf, be|comes always di&s;agreeable to us, merely on its account; as on the other hand, one who&s;e character is only dangerous and di&s;|agreeable to others, can never be &s;atisfied with him&s;elf, as long as he is &s;en&s;ible of that di&s;advantage. Nor is this ob&s;ervable only with regard to characters and manners, but may be remark'd even in the mo&s;t mi|nute circum&s;tances. A violent cough in another gives us unea&s;ine&s;s; tho' in it&s;elf it does not in the lea&s;t affect us. A man will be mortified, if you tell him he has a &s;tink|ing breath; tho' 'tis evidently no annoyance to him&s;elf. Our fancy ea&s;ily changes its &s;ituation; and either &s;urveying our&s;elves as we appear to others, or con&s;idering others as they feel them&s;elves, we enter, by that means, into &s;entiments, which no way be|long to us, and in which nothing but &s;ym|pathy is able to intere&s;t us. And this &s;ym|pathy we &s;ometimes carry &s;o far, as even to be di&s;pleas'd with a quality commodious to us, merely becau&s;e it di&s;plea&s;es others, and makes us di&s;agreeable in their eyes; tho' perhaps we never can have any intere&s;t in rendering our&s;elves agreeable to them.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="236">
THERE have been many &s;y&s;tems of mo|rality advanc'd by philo&s;ophers in all ages; but if they are &s;trictly examin'd, they may be reduc'd to two, which alone merit our attention. Moral good and evil are certainly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by our <HI>&s;entiments,</HI> not by <HI>rea|&s;on:</HI> But the&s;e &s;entiments may ari&s;e either from the mere &s;pecies or appearance of cha|racters and pa&s;&s;ions, or from reflections on their tendency to the happine&s;s of mankind, and of particular per&s;ons. My opinion is, that both the&s;e cau&s;es are intermix'd in our judgments of morals; after the &s;ame manner as they are in our deci&s;ions concerning mo&s;t kinds of external beauty: Tho' I am al&s;o of opinion, that reflections on the tendencies of actions have by far the greate&s;t influence, and determine all the great lines of our duty. There are, however, in&s;tances, in ca&s;es of le&s;s moment, wherein this immediate ta&s;te or &s;entiment produces our approbation. Wit, and a certain ea&s;y and di&s;engag'd behaviour, are qualities <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to others, and command their love and e&s;teem. Some of the&s;e qualities produce &s;atisfaction in others by particular <HI>original</HI> principles of human nature, which cannot be accounted for: Others may be re&s;olv'd into principles,
<PB N="229" REF="237">
which are more general. This will be&s;t ap|pear upon a particular enquiry.</P>
<P>As &s;ome qualities acquire their merit from their being <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to others, without any tendency to public intere&s;t; &s;o &s;ome are denominated virtuous from their being <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to the per&s;on him&s;elf, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them. Each of the pa&s;&s;ions and operations of the mind has a particular feeling, which mu&s;t be either agreeable or di&s;agreeable. The fir&s;t is vir|tuous, the &s;econd vicious. This particular feeling con&s;titutes the very nature of the pa&s;&s;ion; and therefore needs not be account|ed for.</P>
<P>BUT however directly the di&s;tinction of vice and virtue may &s;eem to flow from the immediate plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s, which par|ticular qualities cau&s;e to our&s;elves or others; 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that it has al&s;o a con|&s;iderable dependence on the principle of <HI>&s;ym|pathy</HI> &s;o often in&s;i&s;ted on. We approve of a per&s;on, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of qualities <HI>im|mediately agreeable</HI> to tho&s;e, with whom he has any commerce; tho' perhaps we our|&s;elves never reap'd any plea&s;ure from them. We al&s;o approve of one, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of qualities, that are <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to him&s;elf; tho' they be of no &s;ervice to
<PB N="230" REF="238" MS="y">
any mortal. To account for this we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the foregoing principles.</P>
<P>THUS, to take a general review of the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is: Every quality of the mind is denominated virtuous, which gives plea&s;ure by the mere &s;urvey; as every quality, which produces pain, is call'd vicious. This plea&s;ure and this pain may ari&s;e from four different &s;ources. For we reap a plea&s;ure from the view of a character, which is na|turally fitted to be u&s;eful to others, or to the per&s;on him&s;elf, or which is agreeable to others, or to the per&s;on him&s;elf. One may, perhaps, be &s;urpriz'd, that amid&s;t all the&s;e intere&s;ts and plea&s;ures, we &s;hou'd forget our own, which touches us &s;o nearly on every other occa&s;ion. But we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;atisfy our&s;elves on this head, when we con&s;ider, that every particular per&s;on's plea&s;ure and in|tere&s;t being different, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible men cou'd ever agree in their &s;entiments and judgments, unle&s;s they cho&s;e &s;ome common point of view, from which they might &s;urvey their object, and which might cau&s;e it to appear the &s;ame to all of them. Now in judging of characters, the only intere&s;t and plea&s;ure, which appears the &s;ame to every &s;pectator, is that of the per&s;on him|&s;elf, who&s;e character is examin'd; or that
<PB N="231" REF="239">
of per&s;ons, who have a connexion with him. And tho' &s;uch intere&s;ts and plea&s;ures touch us more faintly than our own, yet being more con&s;tant and univer&s;al, they counter-ballance the latter even in practice, and are alone admitted in &s;peculation as the &s;tandard of virtue and morality. They alone produce that particular feeling or &s;entiment, on which moral di&s;tinctions depend.</P>
<P>AS to the good or ill de&s;ert of virtue or vice, 'tis an evident con&s;equence of the &s;en|timents of plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e &s;entiments produce love or hatred; and love or hatred, by the original con&s;titution of human pa&s;&s;ion, is attended with benevolence or anger; that is, with a de&s;ire of making happy the per&s;on we love, and mi&s;erable the per&s;on we hate. We have treated of this more fully on another occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>IT may now be proper to illu&s;trate this general &s;y&s;tem of morals, by applying it to particular in&s;tances of virtue and vice, and &s;hewing how their merit or demerit
<PB N="232" REF="240">
ari&s;es from the four &s;ources here explain'd. We &s;hall begin with examining the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>humility,</HI> and &s;hall con&s;ider the vice or virtue that lies in their exce&s;&s;es or ju&s;t proportion. An exce&s;&s;ive pride or over|weaning conceit of our&s;elves is always e|&s;teem'd vicious, and is univer&s;ally hated; as mode&s;ty, or a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our weakne&s;s, is e&s;teem'd virtuous, and procures the good|will of every-one. Of the four &s;ources of moral di&s;tinctions, this is to be a&s;crib'd to the <HI>third;</HI> viz, the immediate agreeablene&s;s and di&s;agreeablene&s;s of a quality to others, without any reflections on the tendency of that quality.</P>
<P>IN order to prove this, we mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to two principles, which are very con|&s;picuous in human nature. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is the <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> and communication of &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions above-mention'd. So clo&s;e and intimate is the corre&s;pondence of human &s;ouls, that no &s;ooner any per&s;on ap|proaches me, than he diffu&s;es on me all his opinions, and draws along my judgment in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree. And tho', on many occa&s;ions, my &s;ympathy with him goes not &s;o far as entirely to change my &s;en|timents, and way of thinking; yet it &s;eldom is &s;o weak as not to di&s;turb the ea&s;y cour&s;e
<PB N="233" REF="241">
of my thought, and give an authority to that opinion, which is recommended to me by his a&s;&s;ent and approbation. Nor is it any way material upon what &s;ubject he and I employ our thoughts. Whether we judge of an indifferent per&s;on, or of my own cha|racter, my &s;ympathy gives equal force to his deci&s;ion: And even his &s;entiments of his own merit make me con&s;ider him in the &s;ame light, in which he regards him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS principle of &s;ympathy is of &s;o powerful and in&s;inuating a nature, that it enters into mo&s;t of our &s;entiments and pa&s;|&s;ions, and often takes place under the ap|pearance of its contrary. For 'tis remark|able, that when a per&s;on oppo&s;es me in any thing, which I am &s;trongly bent upon, and rouzes up my pa&s;&s;ion by contradiction, I have always a degree of &s;ympathy with him, nor does my commotion proceed from any other origin. We may here ob&s;erve an evi|dent conflict or rencounter of oppo&s;ite prin|ciples and pa&s;&s;ions. On the one &s;ide there is that pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment, which is natural to me; and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the &s;tronger this pa&s;&s;ion is, the greater is the commotion. There mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion or &s;enti|ment on the other &s;ide; and this pa&s;&s;ion can proceed from nothing but &s;ympathy. The
<PB N="234" REF="242">
&s;entiments of others can never affect us, but by becoming, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, our own; in which ca&s;e they operate upon us, by op|po&s;ing and encrea&s;ing our pa&s;&s;ions, in the very &s;ame manner, as if they had been ori|ginally deriv'd from our own temper and di&s;po&s;ition. While they remain conceal'd in the minds of others, they can never have any influence upon us: And even when they are known, if they went no farther than the imagination, or conception; that faculty is &s;o accu&s;tom'd to objects of every different kind, that a mere idea, tho' contrary to our &s;entiments and inclinations, wou'd never alone be able to affect us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> principle I &s;hall take notice of is that of <HI>compari&s;on,</HI> or the variation of our judgments concerning objects, according to the proportion they bear to tho&s;e with which we compare them. We judge more of objects by compari&s;on, than by their in|trin&s;ic worth and value; and regard every thing as mean, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to what is &s;uperior of the &s;ame kind. But no compari&s;on is more obvious than that with our&s;elves; and hence it is that on all occa|&s;ions it takes place, and mixes with mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions. This kind of compari&s;on is directly contrary to &s;ympathy in its opera|tion,
<PB N="235" REF="243">
as we have ob&s;erv'd in treating of <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>malice.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book II. Part II. Sect. VIII.</NOTE> <HI>In all kinds of com|pari&s;on an object makes us always receive from another, to which it is compar'd, a &s;en&s;ation contrary to what ari&s;es from it&s;elf in its direct and immediate &s;urvey. The direct &s;urvey of another's plea&s;ure naturally gives us plea&s;ure; and therefore produces pain, when compar'd with our own. His pain, con|&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, is painful; but augments the idea of our own happine&s;s, and gives us plea|&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE then tho&s;e principles of &s;ympathy, and a compari&s;on with our&s;elves, are directly contrary, it may be worth while to con&s;ider, what general rules can be form'd, be&s;ide the particular temper of the per&s;on, for the pre|valence of the one or the other. Suppo&s;e I am now in &s;afety at land, and wou'd wil|lingly reap &s;ome plea&s;ure from this con&s;ider|ation: I mu&s;t think on the mi&s;erable con|dition of tho&s;e who are at &s;ea in a &s;torm, and mu&s;t endeavour to render this idea as &s;trong and lively as po&s;&s;ible, in order to make me more &s;en&s;ible of my own happi|ne&s;s. But whatever pains I may take, the compari&s;on will never have an equal efficacy,

'Tis evident, there|fore, there is a medium in this ca&s;e; and that if the idea be too feint, it has no in|fluence by compari&s;on; and on the other hand, if it be too &s;trong, it operates on us entirely by &s;ympathy, which is the contrary to compari&s;on. Sympathy being the con|ver&s;ion of an idea into an impre&s;&s;ion, de|mands a greater force and vivacity in the idea than is requi&s;ite to compari&s;on.</P>
<P>ALL this is ea&s;ily applied to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. We &s;ink very much in our own
<PB N="237" REF="245">
eyes, when in the pre&s;ence of a great man, or one of a &s;uperior genius; and this humi|lity makes a con&s;iderable ingredient in that <HI>re&s;pect,</HI> which we pay our &s;uperiors, accord|ing to our <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Book II. Part II. Sect. X.</NOTE> foregoing rea&s;onings on that pa&s;&s;ion. Sometimes even envy and hatred ari&s;e from the compari&s;on; but in the greate&s;t part of men, it re&s;ts at re&s;pect and e&s;teem. As &s;ympathy has &s;uch a powerful influence on the human mind, it cau&s;es pride to have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;ame effect as merit; and by making us enter into tho&s;e elevated &s;entiments, which the proud man entertains of him&s;elf, pre&s;ents that com|pari&s;on, which is &s;o mortifying and di&s;agree|able. Our judgment does not entirely ac|company him in the flattering conceit, in which he plea&s;es him&s;elf; but &s;till is &s;o &s;haken as to receive the idea it pre&s;ents, and to give it an influence above the loo&s;e con|ceptions of the imagination. A man, who, in an idle humour, wou'd form a notion of a per&s;on of a merit very much &s;uperior to his own, wou'd not be mortified by that fiction: But when a man, whom we are really per&s;uaded to be of inferior merit, is pre&s;ented to us; if we ob&s;erve in him any extraordinary degree of pride and &s;elf-conceit;
<PB N="238" REF="246">
the firm per&s;ua&s;ion he has of his own merit, takes hold of the imagination, and dimi|ni&s;hes us in our own eyes, in the &s;ame man|ner, as if he were really po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the good qualities which he &s;o liberally attributes to him&s;elf. Our idea is here preci&s;ely in that medium, which is requi&s;ite to make it operate on us by compari&s;on. Were it ac|companied with belief, and did the per&s;on appear to have the &s;ame merit, which he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf, it wou'd have a contrary effect, and wou'd operate on us by &s;ympathy. The influence of that principle wou'd then be &s;uperior to that of compari&s;on, contrary to what happens where the per&s;on's merit &s;eems below his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the&s;e prin|ciples is, that pride, or an over-weaning conceit of our&s;elves, mu&s;t be vicious; &s;ince it cau&s;es unea&s;ine&s;s in all men, and pre&s;ents them every moment with a di&s;agreeable com|pari&s;on. 'Tis a trite ob&s;ervation in philo|&s;ophy, and even in common life and con|ver&s;ation, that 'tis our own pride, which makes us &s;o much di&s;pleas'd with the pride of other people; and that vanity becomes in&s;upportable to us merely becau&s;e we are vain. The gay naturally a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with the gay, and the amorous with the
<PB N="239" REF="247">
amorous: But the proud never can endure the proud, and rather &s;eek the company of tho&s;e who are of an oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition. As we are, all of us, proud in &s;ome degree, pride is univer&s;ally blam'd and condemn'd by all mankind; as having a natural ten|dency to cau&s;e unea&s;ine&s;s in others by means of compari&s;on. And this effect mu&s;t fol|low the more naturally, that tho&s;e, who have an ill-grounded conceit of them&s;elves, are for ever making tho&s;e compari&s;ons, nor have they any other method of &s;upporting their vanity. A man of &s;en&s;e and merit is pleas'd with him&s;elf, independent of all foreign con&s;iderations: But a fool mu&s;t al|ways find &s;ome per&s;on, that is more fooli&s;h, in order to keep him&s;elf in good humour with his own parts and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>BUT tho' an over-weaning conceit of our own merit be vicious and di&s;agreeable, no|thing can be more laudable, than to have a value for our&s;elves, where we really have qualities that are valuable. The utility and advantage of any quality to our&s;elves is a &s;ource of virtue, as well as its agreeablene&s;s to others; and 'tis certain, that nothing is more u&s;eful to us in the conduct of life, than a due degree of pride, which makes
<PB N="240" REF="248">
us &s;en&s;ible of our own merit, and gives us a confidence and a&s;&s;urance in all our pro|jects and enterprizes. Whatever capacity any one may be endow'd with, 'tis entirely u&s;ele&s;s to him, if he be not acquainted with it, and form not de&s;igns &s;uitable to it. 'Tis requi&s;ite on all occa&s;ions to know our own force; and were it allowable to err on either &s;ide, 'twou'd be more advantageous to over|rate our merit, than to form ideas of it, below its ju&s;t &s;tandard. Fortune commonly favours the bold and enterprizing; and no|thing in&s;pires us with more boldne&s;s than a good opinion of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that tho' pride, or &s;elf-ap|plau&s;e, be &s;ometimes di&s;agreeable to others, 'tis always agreeable to our&s;elves; as on the other hand, mode&s;ty, tho' it give plea&s;ure to every one, who ob&s;erves it, produces often unea&s;ine&s;s in the per&s;on endow'd with it. Now it has been ob&s;erv'd, that our own &s;en&s;ations determine the vice and virtue of any quality, as well as tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, which it may excite in others.</P>
<P>THUS &s;elf-&s;atisfaction and vanity may not only be allowable, but requi&s;ite in a cha|racter. 'Tis, however, certain, that good|breeding and decency require that we &s;hou'd avoid all &s;igns and expre&s;&s;ions, which tend
<PB N="241" REF="249">
directly to &s;how that pa&s;&s;ion. We have, all of us, a wonderful partiality for our|&s;elves, and were we always to give vent to our &s;entiments in this particular, we &s;hou'd mutually cau&s;e the greate&s;t indignation in each other, not only by the immediate pre|&s;ence of &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ubject of com|pari&s;on, but al&s;o by the contrariety of our judgments. In like manner, therefore, as we e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>laws of nature,</HI> in order to &s;ecure property in &s;ociety, and prevent the oppo&s;ition of &s;elf-intere&s;t; we e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>rules of good-breeding,</HI> in order to prevent the oppo&s;ition of men's pride, and render conver&s;ation agreeable and inoffen&s;ive. No|thing is more di&s;agreeable than a man's over|weaning conceit of him&s;elf: Every one al|mo&s;t has a &s;trong propen&s;ity to this vice: No one can well di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>in him&s;elf</HI> be|twixt the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his e&s;teem of his own merit is well|founded: For the&s;e rea&s;ons, all direct ex|pre&s;&s;ions of this pa&s;&s;ion are condemn'd; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of &s;en&s;e and merit. They are not allow'd to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice openly, in words, no more than other people; and even if they &s;how a re&s;erve and &s;ecret doubt in doing them&s;elves ju&s;tice in
<PB N="242" REF="250">
their own thoughts, they will be more ap|plauded. That impertinent, and almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al propen&s;ity of men, to over-value them&s;elves, has given us &s;uch a <HI>prejudice</HI> again&s;t &s;elf-applau&s;e, that we are apt to condemn it, by a <HI>general rule,</HI> wherever me meet with it; and 'tis with &s;ome difficulty we give a privilege to men of &s;en&s;e, even in their mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts. At lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be own'd, that &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e in this parti|cular is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite; and that if we harbour pride in our brea&s;ts, we mu&s;t carry a fair out&s;ide, and have the appearance of mo|de&s;ty and mutual deference in all our con|duct and behaviour. We mu&s;t, on every occa&s;ion, be ready to prefer others to our|&s;elves; to treat them with a kind of defer|ence, even tho' they be our equals; to &s;eem always the lowe&s;t and lea&s;t in the company, where we are not very much di&s;tingui&s;h'd above them: And if we ob&s;erve the&s;e rules in our conduct, men will have more indul|gence for our &s;ecret &s;entiments, when we di&s;|cover them in an oblique manner.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE no one, who has any prac|tice of the world, and can penetrate into the inward &s;entiments of men, will a&s;&s;ert, that the humility, which good-breeding and decency require of us, goes beyond the out|&s;ide,
<PB N="243" REF="251">
or that a thorough &s;incerity in this particular is e&s;teem'd a real part of our duty. On the contrary, we may ob&s;erve, that a genuine and hearty pride, or &s;elf-e&s;teem, if well conceal'd and well founded, is e&s;&s;ential to the character of a man of honour, and that there is no quality of the mind, which is more indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite to procure the e&s;teem and approbation of mankind. There are certain deferences and mutual &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions, which cu&s;tom requires of the dif|ferent ranks of men towards each other; and whoever exceeds in this particular, if thro' intere&s;t, is accus'd of meanne&s;s; if thro' ig|norance, of &s;implicity. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore, to know our rank and &s;tation in the world, whether it be fix'd by our birth, fortune, employments, talents or reputation. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to feel the &s;entiment and pa&s;&s;ion of pride in conformity to it, and to regulate our actions accordingly. And &s;hou'd it be &s;aid, that prudence may &s;uffice to re|gulate our actions in this particular, with|out any real pride, I wou'd ob&s;erve, that here the object of prudence is to conform our actions to the general u&s;age and cu&s;tom; and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible tho&s;e tacit airs of &s;uperiority &s;hou'd ever have been e&s;tabli&s;h'd
<PB N="244" REF="252">
and authoriz'd by cu&s;tom, unle&s;s men were generally proud, and unle&s;s that pa&s;&s;ion were generally approv'd, when well-grounded.</P>
<P>IF we pa&s;s from common life and con|ver&s;ation to hi&s;tory, this rea&s;oning acquires new force, when we ob&s;erve, that all tho&s;e great actions and &s;entiments, which have become the admiration of mankind, are founded on nothing but pride and &s;elf|e&s;teem. <HI>Go,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great to his &s;oldiers, when they refus'd to follow him to the <HI>Indies, go tell your countrymen, that you left Alexander compleating the conque&s;t of the world.</HI> This pa&s;&s;age was always par|ticularly admir'd by the prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> as we learn from <HI>St. Evremond. <Q REND="inline">"Alexander,"</Q></HI> &s;aid that prince, <Q REND="inline">"abandon'd by his &s;oldiers, among barbarians, not yet fully &s;ubdu'd, felt in him&s;elf &s;uch a dignity and right of empire, that he cou'd not believe it po&s;&s;i|ble any one cou'd refu&s;e to obey him. Whether in <HI>Europe</HI> or in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> among <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> all was indifferent to him: Wherever he found men, he fancied he had found &s;ubjects."</Q></P>
<P>IN general we may ob&s;erve, that what|ever we call <HI>heroic virtue,</HI> and admire under the character of greatne&s;s and elevation of mind, is either nothing but a &s;teady and well-e&s;tabli&s;h'd pride and &s;elf-e&s;teem, or
<PB N="245" REF="253">
partakes largely of that pa&s;&s;ion. Courage, intrepidity, ambition, love of glory, mag|nanimity, and all the other &s;hining virtues of that kind, have plainly a &s;trong mixture of &s;elf-e&s;teem in them, and derive a great part of their merit from that origin. Accord|ingly we find, that many religious de|claimers decry tho&s;e virtues as purely pagan and natural, and repre&s;ent to us the excel|lency of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion, which places humility in the rank of virtues, and corrects the judgment of the world, and even of philo&s;ophers, who &s;o generally admire all the efforts of pride and ambition. Whether this virtue of humility has been rightly un|der&s;tood, I &s;hall not pretend to determine. I am content with the conce&s;&s;ion, that the world naturally e&s;teems a well-regulated pride, which &s;ecretly animates our conduct, with|out breaking out into &s;uch indecent ex|pre&s;&s;ions of vanity, as may offend the vanity of others.</P>
<P>THE merit of pride or &s;elf-e&s;teem is de|riv'd from two circum&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> its utility and its agreeablene&s;s to our&s;elves; by which it capacitates us for bu&s;ine&s;s, and, at the &s;ame time, gives us an immediate &s;atisfaction. When it goes beyond its ju&s;t bounds, it lo&s;es the fir&s;t advantage, and even becomes pre|judicial;
<PB N="246" REF="254" MS="y">
which is the rea&s;on why we con|demn an extravagant pride and ambition, however regulated by the decorums of good|breeding and politene&s;s. But as &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion is &s;till agreeable, and conveys an elevated and &s;ublime &s;en&s;ation to the per&s;on, who is actuated by it, the &s;ympathy with that &s;atisfaction dimini&s;hes con&s;iderably the blame, which naturally attends its dangerous influence on our conduct and behaviour. Accordingly we may ob&s;erve, that an ex|ce&s;&s;ive courage and magnanimity, e&s;pecially when it di&s;plays it&s;elf under the frowns of fortune, contributes, in a great mea&s;ure, to the character of a hero, and will render a per&s;on the admiration of po&s;terity; at the &s;ame time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwi&s;e he wou'd never have been ac|quainted.</P>
<P>HEROISM, or military glory, is much admir'd by the generality of mankind. They con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t &s;ublime kind of merit. Men of cool reflection are not &s;o &s;anguine in their prai&s;es of it. The in|finite confu&s;ions and di&s;order, which it has caus'd in the world, dimini&s;h much of its merit in their eyes. When they wou'd op|po&s;e the popular notions on this head, they
<PB N="247" REF="255">
always paint out the evils, which this &s;up|pos'd virtue has produc'd in human &s;ociety; the &s;ubver&s;ion of empires, the deva&s;tation of provinces, the &s;ack of cities. As long as the&s;e are pre&s;ent to us, we are more inclin'd to hate than admire the ambition of heroes. But when we fix our view on the per&s;on him&s;elf, who is the author of all this mi&s;|chief, there is &s;omething &s;o dazling in his character, the mere contemplation of it &s;o elevates the mind, that we cannot refu&s;e it our admiration. The pain, which we re|ceive from its tendency to the prejudice of &s;ociety, is over-power'd by a &s;tronger and more immediate &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>THUS our explication of the merit or demerit, which attends the degrees of pride or &s;elf-e&s;teem, may &s;erve as a &s;trong argu|ment for the preceding hypothe&s;is, by &s;hew|ing the effects of tho&s;e principles above ex|plain'd in all the variations of our judgments concerning that pa&s;&s;ion. Nor will this rea|&s;oning be advantageous to us only by &s;hew|ing, that the di&s;tinction of vice and virtue ari&s;es from the <HI>four</HI> principles of the <HI>advan|tage</HI> and of the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>per&s;on him|&s;elf,</HI> and of <HI>others:</HI> But may al&s;o afford us
<PB N="248" REF="256">

<P>NO one, who duly con&s;iders of this matter, will make any &s;cruple of allowing, that any piece of ill-breeding, or any expre&s;&s;ion of pride and haughtine&s;s, is di&s;plea&s;ing to us, merely becau&s;e it &s;hocks our own pride, and leads us by &s;ympathy into a compari&s;on, which cau&s;es the di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ion of hu|mility. Now as an in&s;olence of this kind is blam'd even in a per&s;on who has always been civil to our&s;elves in particular; nay, in one, who&s;e name is only known to us in hi&s;tory; it follows, that our di&s;approbation proceeds from a &s;ympathy with others, and from the reflection, that &s;uch a character is highly di&s;plea&s;ing and odious to every one, who conver&s;es or has any intercour&s;e with the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;t of it. We &s;ympathize with tho&s;e people in their unea&s;ine&s;s; and as their unea&s;ine&s;s proceeds in part from a &s;ym|pathy with the per&s;on who in&s;ults them, we may here ob&s;erve a double rebound of the &s;ympathy; which is a principle very &s;imilar to what we have ob&s;erv'd on another occa&s;ion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book II.

<P>HAVING thus explain'd the origin of that prai&s;e and approbation, which attends every thing we call <HI>great</HI> in human affections; we now proceed to give an ac|count of their <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> and &s;hew whence its merit is deriv'd.</P>
<P>WHEN experience has once given us a competent knowledge of human affairs, and has taught us the proportion they bear to human pa&s;&s;ion, we perceive, that the gene|ro&s;ity of men is very limited, and that it &s;eldom extends beyond their friends and fa|mily, or, at mo&s;t, beyond their native coun|try. Being thus acquainted with the nature of man, we expect not any impo&s;&s;ibilities from him; but confine our view to that narrow circle, in which any per&s;on moves, in order to form a judgment of his moral character. When the natural tendency of his pa&s;&s;ions leads him to be &s;erviceable and u&s;eful within his &s;phere, we approve of his character, and love his per&s;on, by a &s;ym|pathy
<PB N="250" REF="258">
with the &s;entiments of tho&s;e, who have a more particular connexion with him. We are quickly oblig'd to forget our own intere&s;t in our judgments of this kind, by rea&s;on of the perpetual contradictions, we meet with in &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, from per&s;ons that are not plac'd in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation, and have not the &s;ame intere&s;t with our&s;elves. The only point of view, in which our &s;entiments concur with tho&s;e of others, is, when we con&s;ider the tendency of any pa&s;&s;ion to the advantage or harm of tho&s;e, who have any immediate connexion or inter|cour&s;e with the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it. And tho' this advantage or harm be often very remote from our&s;elves, yet &s;ometimes 'tis very near us, and intere&s;ts us &s;trongly by &s;ympathy. This concern we readily extend to other ca&s;es, that are re&s;embling; and when the&s;e are very remote, our &s;ympathy is proportionably weaker, and our prai&s;e or blame fainter and more doubtful. The ca&s;e is here the &s;ame as in our judgments con|cerning external bodies. All objects &s;eem to dimini&s;h by their di&s;tance: But tho' the ap|pearance of objects to our &s;en&s;es be the ori|ginal &s;tandard, by which we judge of them, yet we do not &s;ay, that they actually dimi|ni&s;h by the di&s;tance; but correcting the ap|pearance
<PB N="251" REF="259">
by reflection, arrive at a more con|&s;tant and e&s;tabli&s;h'd judgment concerning them. In like manner, tho' &s;ympathy be much fainter than our concern for our&s;elves, and a &s;ympathy with per&s;ons remote from us much fainter than that with per&s;ons near and contiguous; yet we neglect all the&s;e dif|ferences in our calm judgments concerning the characters of men. Be&s;ides, that we our&s;elves often change our &s;ituation in this particular, we every day meet with per&s;ons, who are in a different &s;ituation from our|&s;elves, and who cou'd never conver&s;e with us on any rea&s;onable terms, were we to re|main con&s;tantly in that &s;ituation and point of view, which is peculiar to us. The in|tercour&s;e of &s;entiments, therefore, in &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, makes us form &s;ome general inalterable &s;tandard, by which we may ap|prove or di&s;approve of characters and man|ners. And tho' the <HI>heart</HI> does not always take part with tho&s;e general notions, or re|gulate its love and hatred by them, yet are they &s;ufficient for di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;erve all our purpo&s;es in company, in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in the &s;chools.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e principles we may ea&s;ily ac|count for that merit, which is commonly a&s;crib'd to <HI>genero&s;ity, humanity, compa&s;&s;ion,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="260">
<HI>gratitude, friend&s;hip, fidelity, zeal, di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, liberality,</HI> and all tho&s;e other qualities, which form the character of good and benevolent. A propen&s;ity to the tender pa&s;&s;ions makes a man agreeable and u&s;eful in all the parts of life; and gives a ju&s;t direction to all his other qualities, which otherwi&s;e may become prejudicial to &s;ociety. Courage and ambition, when not regulated by bene|volence, are fit only to make a tyrant and public robber. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with judg|ment and capacity, and all the qualities of that kind. They are indifferent in them|&s;elves to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and have a tendency to the good or ill of mankind, ac|cording as they are directed by the&s;e other pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>AS love is <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to the per&s;on, who is actuated by it, and hatred <HI>immediately di&s;agreeable;</HI> this may al&s;o be a con&s;iderable rea&s;on, why we prai&s;e all the pa&s;&s;ions that partake of the former, and blame all tho&s;e that have any con&s;iderable &s;hare of the latter. 'Tis certain we are in|finitely touch'd with a tender &s;entiment, as well as with a great one. The tears natu|rally &s;tart in our eyes at the conception of it; nor can we forbear giving a loo&s;e to the &s;ame tenderne&s;s towards the per&s;on who ex|erts
<PB N="253" REF="261">
it. All this &s;eems to me a proof, that our approbation has, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, an origin different from the pro&s;pect of utility and ad|vantage, either to our&s;elves or others. To which we may add, that men naturally, without reflection, approve of that character, which is mo&s;t like their own. The man of a mild di&s;po&s;ition and tender affections, in forming a notion of the mo&s;t perfect virtue, mixes in it more of benevolence and huma|nity, than the man of courage and enter|prize, who naturally looks upon a certain elevation of mind as the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd character. This mu&s;t evidently pro|ceed from an <HI>immediate</HI> &s;ympathy, which men have with characters &s;imilar to their own. They enter with more warmth into &s;uch &s;entiments, and feel more &s;en&s;ibly the plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from them.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable, that nothing touches a man of humanity more than any in&s;tance of extraordinary delicacy in love or friend&s;hip, where a per&s;on is attentive to the &s;malle&s;t concerns of his friend, and is willing to &s;acri|fice to them the mo&s;t con&s;iderable intere&s;t of his own. Such delicacies have little influence on &s;ociety; becau&s;e they make us regard the greate&s;t trifles: But they are the more en|gaging, the more minute the concern is, and
<PB N="254" REF="262">
are a proof of the highe&s;t merit in any one, who is capable of them. The pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o contagious, that they pa&s;s with the greate&s;t facility from one per&s;on to another, and pro|duce corre&s;pondent movements in all human brea&s;ts. Where friend&s;hip appears in very &s;ignal in&s;tances, my heart catches the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, and is warm'd by tho&s;e warm &s;enti|ments, that di&s;play them&s;elves before me. Such agreeable movements mu&s;t give me an affection to every one that excites them. This is the ca&s;e with every thing that is agreeable in any per&s;on. The tran&s;ition from plea&s;ure to love is ea&s;y: But the tran&s;ition mu&s;t here be &s;till more ea&s;y; &s;ince the agree|able &s;entiment, which is excited by &s;ym|pathy, is love it&s;elf; and there is nothing requir'd but to change the object.</P>
<P>HENCE the peculiar merit of benevolence in all its &s;hapes and appearances. Hence even its weakne&s;&s;es are virtuous and amiable; and a per&s;on, who&s;e grief upon the lo&s;s of a friend were exce&s;&s;ive, wou'd be e&s;teem'd upon that account. His tenderne&s;s be&s;tows a merit, as it does a plea&s;ure, on his melan|choly.</P>
<P>WE are not, however, to imagine, that all the angry pa&s;&s;ions are vicious, tho' they are di&s;agreeable. There is a certain indul|gence
<PB N="255" REF="263">
due to human nature in this re&s;pect. Anger and hatred are pa&s;&s;ions inherent in our very frame and con&s;titution. The want of them, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, may even be a proof of weakne&s;s and imbecillity. And where they appear only in a low degree, we not only excu&s;e them becau&s;e they are na|tural; but even be&s;tow our applau&s;es on them, becau&s;e they are inferior to what ap|pears in the greate&s;t part of mankind.</P>
<P>WHERE the&s;e angry pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e up to cruelty, they form the mo&s;t dete&s;ted of all vices. All the pity and concern which we have for the mi&s;erable &s;ufferers by this vice, turns again&s;t the per&s;on guilty of it, and pro|duces a &s;tronger hatred than we are &s;en&s;ible of on any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>EVEN when the vice of inhumanity ri&s;es not to this extreme degree, our &s;entiments concerning it are very much influenc'd by re|flections on the harm that re&s;ults from it. And we may ob&s;erve in general, that if we can find any quality in a per&s;on, which renders him incommodious to tho&s;e, who live and conver&s;e with him, we always allow it to be a fault or blemi&s;h, without any farther examina|tion. On the other hand, when we enu|merate the good qualities of any per&s;on, we always mention tho&s;e parts of his character,
<PB N="256" REF="264">
which render him a &s;afe companion, an ea&s;y friend, a gentle ma&s;ter, an agreeable hu&s;|band, or an indulgent father. We con&s;ider him with all his relations in &s;ociety; and love or hate him, according as he affects tho&s;e, who have any immediate intercour&s;e with him. And 'tis a mo&s;t certain rule, that if there be no relation of life, in which I cou'd not wi&s;h to &s;tand to a particular per&s;on, his character mu&s;t &s;o far be allow'd to be perfect. If he be as little wanting to him&s;elf as to others, his character is entirely perfect. This is the ultimate te&s;t of merit and virtue.</P>

<P>NO di&s;tinction is more u&s;ual in all &s;y&s;tems of ethics, than that betwixt <HI>natural abilities</HI> and <HI>moral virtues;</HI> where the former are plac'd on the &s;ame footing with bodily endowments, and are &s;uppos'd to have no merit or moral worth annex'd to them. Whoever con&s;iders the matter accu|rately, will find, that a di&s;pute upon this head wou'd be merely a di&s;pute of words,
<PB N="257" REF="265">
and that tho' the&s;e qualities are not alto|gether of the &s;ame kind, yet they agree in the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances. They are both of them equally mental qualities: And both of them equally produce plea&s;ure; and have of cour&s;e an equal tendency to pro|cure the love and e&s;teem of mankind. There are few, who are not as jealous of their character, with regard to &s;en&s;e and know|ledge, as to honour and courage; and much more than with regard to temperance and &s;obriety. Men are even afraid of pa&s;&s;ing for good-natur'd; le&s;t <HI>that</HI> &s;hou'd be taken for want of under&s;tanding: And often boa&s;t of more debauches than they have been really engag'd in, to give them&s;elves airs of fire and &s;pirit. In &s;hort, the figure a man makes in the world, the reception he meets with in company, the e&s;teem paid him by his acquaintance; all the&s;e advantages depend almo&s;t as much upon his good &s;en&s;e and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Let a man have the be&s;t inten|tions in the world, and be the farthe&s;t from all inju&s;tice and violence, he will never be able to make him&s;elf be much regarded, without a moderate &s;hare, at lea&s;t, of parts and under&s;tanding. Since then natural abi|lities, tho', perhaps, inferior, yet are on the
<PB N="258" REF="266">
&s;ame footing, both as to their cau&s;es and effects, with tho&s;e qualities which we call moral virtues, why &s;hou'd we make any di&s;tinction betwixt them?</P>
<P>THO' we refu&s;e to natural abilities the title of virtues, we mu&s;t allow, that they procure the love and e&s;teem of mankind; that they give a new lu&s;tre to the other vir|tues; and that a man po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them is much more intitled to our good-will and &s;ervices, than one entirely void of them. It may, indeed, be pretended, that the &s;enti|ment of approbation, which tho&s;e qualities produce, be&s;ides its being <HI>inferior,</HI> is al&s;o &s;omewhat <HI>different</HI> from that, which attends the other virtues. But this, in my opinion, is not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for excluding them from the catalogue of virtues. Each of the virtues, even benevolence, ju&s;tice, gratitude, integrity, excites a different &s;entiment or feeling in the &s;pectator. The characters of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Cato,</HI> as drawn by <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> are both of them virtuous, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the &s;entiments entirely the &s;ame, which ari&s;e from them. The one produces love; the other e&s;teem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We cou'd wi&s;h to meet with the one character in a friend; the other cha|racter
<PB N="259" REF="267">
we wou'd be ambitious of in our&s;elves. In like manner, the approbation, which at|tends natural abilities, may be &s;omewhat different to the feeling from that, which ari&s;es from the other virtues, without making them entirely of a different &s;pecies. And indeed we may ob&s;erve, that the natu|ral abilities, no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the &s;ame kind of approbation. Good &s;en&s;e and genius beget e&s;teem: Wit and humour excite love <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Love and e&s;teem are at the bottom the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and ari&s;e from like cau&s;es. The qualities, that produce both, are agreeable, and give plea&s;ure. But where this plea&s;ure is &s;e|vere and &s;erious; or where its object is great, and makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion; or where it produces any degree of humi|lity and awe: In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the pa&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es from the plea&s;ure, is more properly denominated e&s;teem than love. Benevolence attends both: But is connected with love in a more eminent degree.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOSE, who repre&s;ent the di&s;tinction be|twixt natural abilities and moral virtues as very material, may &s;ay, that the former are entirely involuntary, and have therefore no merit attending them, as having no depend|ance on liberty and free-will. But to this I an&s;wer, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that many of tho&s;e qualities, which all morali&s;ts, e&s;pecially the antients, comprehend under the title of moral virtues, are equally involuntary and nece&s;&s;ary, with the qualities of the judgment and imagina|tion.
<PB N="260" REF="268">
Of this nature are con&s;tancy, forti|tude, magnanimity; and, in &s;hort, all the qualities which form the <HI>great</HI> man. I might &s;ay the &s;ame, in &s;ome degree, of the others; it being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to change its character in any con|&s;iderable article, or cure it&s;elf of a pa&s;&s;ionate or &s;plenetic temper, when they are natural to it. The greater degree there is of the&s;e blameable qualities, the more vicious they become, and yet they are the le&s;s voluntary. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I wou'd have any one give me a rea&s;on, why virtue and vice may not be in|voluntary, as well as beauty and deformity. The&s;e moral di&s;tinctions ari&s;e from the natu|ral di&s;tinctions of pain and plea&s;ure; and when we receive tho&s;e feelings from the general con&s;ideration of any quality or cha|racter, we denominate it vicious or virtuous. Now I believe no one will a&s;&s;ert, that a quality can never produce plea&s;ure or pain to the per&s;on who con&s;iders it, unle&s;s it be perfectly voluntary in the per&s;on who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es it. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to free-will, we have &s;hewn that it has no place with regard to the actions, no more than the qualities of men. It is not a ju&s;t con&s;equence, that what is voluntary is free. Our actions are more voluntary than our judgments; but we
<PB N="261" REF="269">
have not more liberty in the one than in the other.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this di&s;tinction betwixt volun|tary and involuntary be not &s;ufficient to ju|&s;tify the di&s;tinction betwixt natural abilities and moral virtues, yet the former di&s;tinction will afford us a plau&s;ible rea&s;on, why mo|rali&s;ts have invented the latter. Men have ob&s;erv'd, that tho' natural abilities and moral qualities be in the main on the &s;ame footing, there is, however, this difference betwixt them, that the former are almo&s;t invariable by any art or indu&s;try; while the latter, or at lea&s;t, the actions, that proceed from them, may be chang'd by the motives of rewards and puni&s;hments, prai&s;e and blame. Hence legi&s;lators, and divines, and morali&s;ts, have principally applied them&s;elves to the regu|lating the&s;e voluntary actions, and have en|deavour'd to produce additional motives for being virtuous in that particular. They knew, that to puni&s;h a man for folly, or exhort him to be prudent and &s;agacious, wou'd have but little effect; tho' the &s;ame puni&s;hments and exhortations, with regard to ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice, might have a con|&s;iderable influence. But as men, in com|mon life and conver&s;ation, do not carry tho&s;e ends in view, but naturally prai&s;e or blame
<PB N="262" REF="270">
whatever plea&s;es or di&s;plea&s;es them, they do not &s;eem much to regard this di&s;tinction, but con&s;ider prudence under the character of vir|tue as well as benevolence, and penetration as well as ju&s;tice. Nay, we find, that all morali&s;ts, who&s;e judgment is not perverted by a &s;trict adherence to a &s;y&s;tem, enter into the &s;ame way of thinking; and that the antient morali&s;ts in particular made no &s;cru|ple of placing prudence at the head of the cardinal virtues. There is a &s;entiment of e&s;teem and approbation, which may be ex|cited, in &s;ome degree, by any faculty of the mind, in its perfect &s;tate and condition; and to account for this &s;entiment is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> It belongs to <HI>Gram|marians</HI> to examine what qualities are en|titled to the denomination of <HI>virtue;</HI> nor will they find, upon trial, that this is &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k, as at fir&s;t &s;ight they may be apt to imagine.</P>
<P>THE principal rea&s;on why natural abili|ties are e&s;teem'd, is becau&s;e of their tendency to be u&s;eful to the per&s;on, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to execute any de&s;ign with &s;ucce&s;s, where it is not conducted with prudence and di&s;cretion; nor will the good|ne&s;s of our intentions alone &s;uffice to pro|cure us a happy i&s;&s;ue to our enterprizes.
<PB N="263" REF="271">
Men are &s;uperior to bea&s;ts principally by the &s;uperiority of their rea&s;on; and they are the degrees of the &s;ame faculty, which &s;et &s;uch an infinite difference betwixt one man and another. All the advantages of art are owing to human rea&s;on; and where fortune is not very capricious, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the&s;e advantages mu&s;t fall to the &s;hare of the prudent and &s;agacious.</P>
<P>WHEN it is a&s;k'd, whether a quick or a &s;low apprehen&s;ion be mo&s;t valuable? whether one, that at fir&s;t view penetrates into a &s;ub|ject, but can perform nothing upon &s;tudy; or a contrary character, which mu&s;t work out every thing by dint of application? whether a clear head, or a copious inven|tion? whether a profound genius, or a &s;ure judgment? in &s;hort, what character, or pe|culiar under&s;tanding, is more excellent than another? 'Tis evident we can an&s;wer none of the&s;e que&s;tions, without con&s;idering which of tho&s;e qualities capacitates a man be&s;t for the world, and carries him farthe&s;t in any of his undertakings.</P>
<P>THERE are many other qualities of the mind, who&s;e merit is deriv'd from the &s;ame origin. <HI>Indu&s;try, per&s;everance, patience, ac|tivity, vigilance, application, con&s;tancy,</HI> with other virtues of that kind, which 'twill be
<PB N="264" REF="272">
ea&s;y to recollect, are e&s;teem'd valuable upon no other account, than their advantage in the conduct of life. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with <HI>temperance, frugality, oeconomy, re&s;olution:</HI> As on the other hand, <HI>prodigality, luxury, irre&s;olution, uncertainty,</HI> are vicious, merely becau&s;e they draw ruin upon us, and inca|pacitate us for bu&s;ine&s;s and action.</P>
<P>As wi&s;dom and good-&s;en&s;e are valued, becau&s;e they are <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them; &s;o <HI>wit</HI> and <HI>eloquence</HI> are valued, becau&s;e they are <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to others. On the other hand, <HI>good humour</HI> is lov'd and e&s;teem'd, becau&s;e it is <HI>immediately agreeable</HI> to the per&s;on him&s;elf. 'Tis evi|dent, that the conver&s;ation of a man of wit is very &s;atisfactory; as a chearful good-hu|mour'd companion diffu&s;es a joy over the whole company, from a &s;ympathy with his gaiety. The&s;e qualities, therefore, being agreeable, they naturally beget love and e&s;teem, and an&s;wer to all the characters of virtue.</P>
<P>'Tis difficult to tell, on many occa&s;ions, what it is that renders one man's conver&s;ation &s;o agreeable and entertaining, and another's &s;o in&s;ipid and di&s;ta&s;teful. As conver&s;ation is a tran&s;cript of the mind as well as books, the &s;ame qualities, which render the one
<PB N="265" REF="273">
valuable, mu&s;t give us an e&s;teem for the other. This we &s;hall con&s;ider afterwards. In the mean time it may be affirm'd in ge|neral, that all the merit a man may derive from his conver&s;ation (which, no doubt, may be very con&s;iderable) ari&s;es from no|thing but the plea&s;ure it conveys to tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN this view, <HI>cleanline&s;s</HI> is al&s;o to be re|garded as a virtue; &s;ince it naturally renders us agreeable to others, and is a very con|&s;iderable &s;ource of love and affection. No one will deny, that a negligence in this par|ticular is a fault; and as faults are nothing but &s;maller vices, and this fault can have no other origin than the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, which it excites in others, we may in this in&s;tance, &s;eemingly &s;o trivial, clearly di&s;cover the ori|gin of the moral di&s;tinction of vice and vir|tue in other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>BESIDES all tho&s;e qualities, which render a per&s;on lovely or valuable, there is al&s;o a certain <HI>je-ne-&s;&ccedil;ai-quoi</HI> of agreeable and hand|&s;ome, that concurs to the &s;ame effect. In this ca&s;e, as well as in that of wit and elo|quence, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to a certain &s;en&s;e, which acts without reflection, and re|gards not the tendencies of qualities and characters.

the &s;entiments of virtue by this &s;en&s;e. Their hypothe&s;is is very plau&s;ible. Nothing but a particular enquiry can give the preference to any other hypothe&s;is. When we find, that almo&s;t all the virtues have &s;uch particular ten|dencies; and al&s;o find, that the&s;e tendencies are &s;ufficient alone to give a &s;trong &s;enti|ment of approbation: We cannot doubt, after this, that qualities are approv'd of, in proportion to the advantage, which re&s;ults from them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>decorum</HI> or <HI>indecorum</HI> of a quality, with regard to the age, or character, or &s;ta|tion, contributes al&s;o to its prai&s;e or blame. This decorum depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon experience. 'Tis u&s;ual to &s;ee men lo&s;e their levity, as they advance in years. Such a degree of gravity, therefore, and &s;uch years, are connected together in our thoughts. When we ob&s;erve them &s;eparated in any per&s;on's character, this impo&s;es a kind of violence on our imagination, and is di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>THAT faculty of the &s;oul, which, of all others, is of the lea&s;t con&s;equence to the character, and has the lea&s;t virtue or vice in its &s;everal degrees, at the &s;ame time, that it admits of a great variety of degrees, is the <HI>memory.</HI> Unle&s;s it ri&s;e up to that &s;tupen|dous
<PB N="267" REF="275">
height as to &s;urprize us, or &s;ink &s;o low as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to affect the judgment, we commonly take no notice of its varia|tions, nor ever mention them to the prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e of any per&s;on. 'Tis &s;o far from being a virtue to have a good memory, that men generally affect to complain of a bad one; and endeavouring to per&s;uade the world, that what they &s;ay is entirely of their own invention, &s;acrifice it to the prai&s;e of genius and judgment. Yet to con&s;ider the matter ab&s;tractedly, 'twou'd be difficult to give a rea&s;on, why the faculty of recalling pa&s;t ideas with truth and clearne&s;s, &s;hou'd not have as much merit in it, as the faculty of placing our pre&s;ent ideas in &s;uch an order, as to form true propo&s;itions and opinions. The rea&s;on of the difference certainly mu&s;t be, that the memory is exerted without any &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain; and in all its middling degrees &s;erves almo&s;t equally well in bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs. But the lea&s;t varia|tions in the judgment are &s;en&s;ibly felt in their con&s;equences; while at the &s;ame time that faculty is never exerted in any eminent de|gree, without an extraordinary delight and &s;atisfaction. The &s;ympathy with this utility and plea&s;ure be&s;tows a merit on the under|&s;tanding; and the ab&s;ence of it makes us
<PB N="268" REF="276">
con&s;ider the memory as a faculty very in|different to blame or prai&s;e.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this &s;ubject of <HI>natural abilities,</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, perhaps, one &s;ource of the e&s;teem and affection, which attends them, is deriv'd from the <HI>importance</HI> and <HI>weight,</HI> which they be&s;tow on the per|&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them. He becomes of greater con&s;equence in life. His re&s;olutions and actions affect a greater number of his fellow-creatures. Both his friend&s;hip and enmity are of moment. And 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that whoever is elevated, after this manner, above the re&s;t of mankind, mu&s;t excite in us the &s;entiments of e&s;teem and approbation. Whatever is important engages our attention, fixes our thought, and is con|templated with &s;atisfaction. The hi&s;tories of kingdoms are more intere&s;ting than do|me&s;tic &s;tories: The hi&s;tories of great empires more than tho&s;e of &s;mall cities and principa|lities: And the hi&s;tories of wars and revo|lutions more than tho&s;e of peace and order. We &s;ympathize with the per&s;ons that &s;uffer, in all the various &s;entiments which belong to their fortunes. The mind is occupied by the multitude of the objects, and by the &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, that di&s;play them&s;elves. And this occupation or agitation of the mind is
<PB N="269" REF="277">
commonly agreeable and amu&s;ing. The &s;ame theory accounts for the e&s;teem and regard we pay to men of extraordinary parts and abilities. The good and ill of multitudes are connected with their actions. Whatever they undertake is important, and challenges our attention. Nothing is to be over-look'd and de&s;pis'd, that regards them. And where any per&s;on can excite the&s;e &s;entiments, he &s;oon acquires our e&s;teem; unle&s;s other cir|cum&s;tances of his character render him odious and di&s;agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Some farther reflections concerning the natural virtues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd, in treating of the pa&s;&s;ions, that pride and humility, love and hatred, are excited by any advantages or di&s;advantages of the <HI>mind, body,</HI> or <HI>fortune;</HI> and that the&s;e advantages or di&s;advantages have that effect by producing a &s;eparate im|pre&s;&s;ion of pain or plea&s;ure. The pain or plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from the general &s;ur|vey or view of any action or quality of the <HI>mind,</HI> con&s;titutes its vice or virtue, and gives
<PB N="270" REF="278">
ri&s;e to our approbation or blame, which is nothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love or hatred. We have a&s;&s;ign'd four dif|ferent &s;ources of this pain and plea&s;ure; and in order to ju&s;tify more fully that hypo|the&s;is, it may here be proper to ob&s;erve, that the advantages or di&s;advantages of the <HI>body</HI> and of <HI>fortune,</HI> produce a pain or plea&s;ure from the very &s;ame principles. The ten|dency of any object to be <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to the per|&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, or to others; to convey <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> to him or to others; all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances convey an immediate plea&s;ure to the per&s;on, who con&s;iders the object, and command his love and approbation.</P>
<P>TO begin with the advantages of the <HI>body;</HI> we may ob&s;erve a phaenomenon, which might appear &s;omewhat trivial and ludicrous, if any thing cou'd be trivial, which fortified a con|clu&s;ion of &s;uch importance, or ludicrous, which was employ'd in a philo&s;ophical rea|&s;oning. 'Tis a general remark, that tho&s;e we call good <HI>women's men,</HI> who have either &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves by their amorous ex|ploits, or who&s;e make of body promi&s;es any extraordinary vigour of that kind, are well received by the fair &s;ex, and naturally engage the affections even of tho&s;e, who&s;e virtue pre|vents any de&s;ign of ever giving employment
<PB N="271" REF="279">
to tho&s;e talents. Here 'tis evident, that the ability of &s;uch a per&s;on to give enjoyment, is the real &s;ource of that love and e&s;teem he meets with among the females; at the &s;ame time that the women, who love and e&s;teem him, have no pro&s;pect of receiving that en|joyment them&s;elves, and can only be affected by means of their &s;ympathy with one, that has a commerce of love with him. This in&s;tance is &s;ingular, and merits our atten|tion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;ource of the plea&s;ure we re|ceive from con&s;idering bodily advantages, is their utility to the per&s;on him&s;elf, who is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them. 'Tis certain, that a con|&s;iderable part of the beauty of men, as well as of other animals, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a con|formation of members, as we find by ex|perience to be attended with &s;trength and agility, and to capacitate the creature for any action or exerci&s;e. Broad &s;houlders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper legs; all the&s;e are beautiful in our &s;pecies, becau&s;e they are &s;igns of force and vigour, which being ad|vantages we naturally &s;ympathize with, they convey to the beholder a &s;hare of that &s;ati&s;|faction they produce in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>SO far as to the <HI>utility,</HI> which may attend any quality of the body. As to the imme|diate
<PB N="272" REF="280">
<HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> 'tis certain, that an air of health, as well as of &s;trength and agility, makes a con&s;iderable part of beauty; and that a &s;ickly air in another is always di&s;|agreeable, upon account of that idea of pain and unea&s;ine&s;s, which it conveys to us. On the other hand, we are pleas'd with the re|gularity of our own features, tho' it be nei|ther u&s;eful to our&s;elves nor others; and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to &s;et our|&s;elves at a di&s;tance, to make it convey to us any &s;atisfaction. We commonly con&s;ider our&s;elves as we appear in the eyes of others, and &s;ympathize with the advantageous &s;en|timents they entertain with regard to us.</P>
<P>HOW far the advantages of <HI>fortune</HI> pro|duce e&s;teem and approbation from the &s;ame principles, we may &s;atisfy our&s;elves by reflecting on our precedent rea&s;oning on that &s;ubject. We have ob&s;erv'd, that our approbation of tho&s;e, who are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the advantages of fortune, may be a&s;crib'd to three different cau&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To that im|mediate plea&s;ure, which a rich man gives us, by the view of the beautiful cloaths, equi|page, gardens, or hou&s;es, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To the advantage, which we hope to reap from him by his genero&s;ity and libe|rality. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To the plea&s;ure and advan|tage,
<PB N="273" REF="281">
which he him&s;elf reaps from his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and which produce an agreeable &s;ympathy in us. Whether we a&s;cribe our e&s;teem of the rich and great to one or all of the&s;e cau&s;es, we may clearly &s;ee the traces of tho&s;e principles, which give ri&s;e to the &s;en&s;e of vice and virtue. I believe mo&s;t people, at fir&s;t &s;ight, will be inclin'd to a&s;cribe our e&s;teem of the rich to &s;elf-intere&s;t, and the pro&s;pect of advantage. But as 'tis certain, that our e&s;teem or deference extends beyond any pro&s;pect of advantage to our&s;elves, 'tis evident, that that &s;entiment mu&s;t proceed from a &s;ympathy with tho&s;e, who are de|pendent on the per&s;on we e&s;teem and re&s;pect, and who have an immediate connexion with him. We con&s;ider him as a per&s;on capable of contributing to the happine&s;s or enjoy|ment of his fellow-creatures, who&s;e &s;enti|ments, with regard to him, we naturally embrace. And this con&s;ideration will &s;erve to ju&s;tify my hypothe&s;is in preferring the <HI>third</HI> principle to the other two, and a&s;cribing our e&s;teem of the rich to a &s;ympathy with the plea&s;ure and advantage, which they them|&s;elves receive from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. For as even the other two principles cannot operate to a due extent, or account for all the phae|nomena, without having recour&s;e to a &s;ym|pathy
<PB N="274" REF="282">
of one kind or other; 'tis much more natural to chu&s;e that &s;ympathy, which is immediate and direct, than that which is re|mote and indirect. To which we may add, that where the riches or power are very great, and render the per&s;on con&s;iderable and important in the world, the e&s;teem attend|ing them, may, in part, be a&s;crib'd to ano|ther &s;ource, di&s;tinct from the&s;e three, <HI>viz.</HI> their intere&s;ting the mind by a pro&s;pect of the multitude, and importance of their con|&s;equences: Tho', in order to account for the operation of this principle, we mu&s;t al&s;o have recour&s;e to <HI>&s;ympathy;</HI> as we have ob|&s;erv'd in the preceding &s;ection.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, to remark the flexibility of our &s;entiments, and the &s;everal changes they &s;o readily receive from the objects, with which they are con|join'd. All the &s;entiments of approbation, which attend any particular &s;pecies of ob|jects, have a great re&s;emblance to each other, tho' deriv'd from different &s;ources; and, on the other hand, tho&s;e &s;entiments, when di|rected to different objects, are different to the feeling, tho' deriv'd from the &s;ame &s;ource. Thus the beauty of all vi&s;ible objects cau&s;es a plea&s;ure pretty much the &s;ame, tho' it be &s;ometimes deriv'd from the mere <HI>&s;pecies</HI> and
<PB N="275" REF="283">
appearance of the objects; &s;ometimes from &s;ympathy, and an idea of their utility. In like manner, whenever we &s;urvey the actions and characters of men, without any particu|lar intere&s;t in them, the plea&s;ure, or pain, which ari&s;es from the &s;urvey (with &s;ome minute differences) is, in the main, of the &s;ame kind, tho' perhaps there be a great diver&s;ity in the cau&s;es, from which it is de|riv'd. On the other hand, a convenient hou&s;e, and a virtuous character, cau&s;e not the &s;ame feeling of approbation; even tho' the &s;ource of our approbation be the &s;ame, and flow from &s;ympathy and an idea of their utility. There is &s;omething very inex|plicable in this variation of our feelings; but 'tis what we have experience of with regard to all our pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Conclu&s;ion of this book.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS upon the whole I am hopeful, that nothing is wanting to an accu|rate proof of this &s;y&s;tem of ethics. We are certain, that &s;ympathy is a very powerful principle in human nature. We are al&s;o
<PB N="276" REF="284">
certain, that it has a great influence on our &s;en&s;e of beauty, when we regard external objects, as well as when we judge of morals. We find, that it has force &s;ufficient to give us the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of approbation, when it operates alone, without the con|currence of any other principle; as in the ca&s;es of ju&s;tice, allegiance, cha&s;tity, and good-manners. We may ob&s;erve, that all the circum&s;tances requi&s;ite for its operation are found in mo&s;t of the virtues; which have, for the mo&s;t part, a tendency to the good of &s;ociety, or to that of the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them. If we compare all the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hall not doubt, that &s;ym|pathy is the chief &s;ource of moral di&s;tinctions; e&s;pecially when we reflect, that no objection can be rais'd again&s;t this hypothe&s;is in one ca&s;e, which will not extend to all ca&s;es. Ju&s;tice is certainly approv'd of for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e it has a tendency to the public good: And the public good is in|different to us, except &s;o far as &s;ympathy in|tere&s;ts us in it. We may pre&s;ume the like with regard to all the other virtues, which have a like tendency to the public good. They mu&s;t derive all their merit from our &s;ym|pathy with tho&s;e, who reap any advantage from them: As the virtues, which have a
<PB N="277" REF="285">
tendency to the good of the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them, derive their merit from our &s;ym|pathy with him.</P>
<P>MOST people will readily allow, that the u&s;eful qualities of the mind are virtuous, be|cau&s;e of their utility. This way of think|ing is &s;o natural, and occurs on &s;o many oc|ca&s;ions, that few will make any &s;cruple of admitting it. Now this being once admit|ted, the force of &s;ympathy mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be acknowledg'd. Virtue is con&s;ider'd as means to an end. Means to an end are only valued &s;o far as the end is valued. But the happine&s;s of &s;trangers affects us by &s;ympathy alone. To that principle, there|fore, we are to a&s;cribe the &s;entiment of ap|probation, which ari&s;es from the &s;urvey of all tho&s;e virtues, that are u&s;eful to &s;ociety, or to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them. The&s;e form the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of mo|rality.</P>
<P>WERE it proper in &s;uch a &s;ubject to bribe the readers a&s;&s;ent, or employ any thing but &s;olid argument, we are here abundantly &s;up|plied with topics to engage the affections. All lovers of virtue (and &s;uch we all are in &s;peculation, however we may degenerate in practice) mu&s;t certainly be pleas'd to &s;ee
<PB N="278" REF="286">
moral di&s;tinctions deriv'd from &s;o noble a &s;ource, which gives us a ju&s;t notion both of the <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>capacity</HI> of human nature. It requires but very little knowledge of hu|man affairs to perceive, that a &s;en&s;e of mo|rals is a principle inherent in the &s;oul, and one of the mo&s;t powerful that enters into the compo&s;ition. But this &s;en&s;e mu&s;t certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on it&s;elf, it approves of tho&s;e principles, from whence it is deriv'd, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its ri&s;e and origin. Tho&s;e who re&s;olve the &s;en&s;e of morals into ori|ginal in&s;tincts of the human mind, may de|fend the cau&s;e of virtue with &s;ufficient autho|rity; but want the advantage, which tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s, who account for that &s;en&s;e by an exten&s;ive &s;ympathy with mankind. Accord|ing to their &s;y&s;tem, not only virtue mu&s;t be approv'd of, but al&s;o the &s;en&s;e of virtue: And not only that &s;en&s;e, but al&s;o the prin|ciples, from whence it is deriv'd. So that nothing is pre&s;ented on any &s;ide, but what is laudable and good.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation may be extended to ju&s;tice, and the other virtues of that kind. Tho' ju&s;tice be artificial, the &s;en&s;e of its mo|rality is natural. 'Tis the combination of men, in a &s;y&s;tem of conduct, which renders
<PB N="279" REF="287">
any act of ju&s;tice beneficial to &s;ociety. But when once it has that tendency, we <HI>natu|rally</HI> approve of it; and if we did not &s;o, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible any combination or convention cou'd ever produce that &s;entiment.</P>
<P>MOST of the inventions of men are &s;ub|ject to change. They depend upon humour and caprice. They have a vogue for a time, and then &s;ink into oblivion. It may, per|haps, be apprehended, that if ju&s;tice were allow'd to be a human invention, it mu&s;t be plac'd on the &s;ame footing. But the ca&s;es are widely different. The intere&s;t, on which ju&s;tice is founded, is the greate&s;t imaginable, and extends to all times and places. It can|not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;erv'd by any other inven|tion. It is obvious, and di&s;covers it&s;elf on the very fir&s;t formation of &s;ociety. All the&s;e cau&s;es render the rules of ju&s;tice &s;tedfa&s;t and immutable; at lea&s;t, as immutable as human nature. And if they were founded on ori|ginal in&s;tincts, cou'd they have any greater &s;tability?</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;y&s;tem may help us to form a ju&s;t notion of the <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> as well as of the <HI>dignity</HI> of virtue, and may intere&s;t every principle of our nature in the embracing and cheri&s;hing that noble quality. Who in|deed does not feel an acce&s;&s;ion of alacrity in
<PB N="280" REF="288">
his pur&s;uits of knowledge and ability of every kind, when he con&s;iders, that be&s;ides the advantage, which immediately re&s;ult from the&s;e acqui&s;itions, they al&s;o give him a new lu&s;tre in the eyes of mankind, and are univer&s;ally attended with e&s;teem and appro|bation? And who can think any advantages of fortune a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for the lea&s;t breach of the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> virtues, when he con&s;iders, that not only his character with regard to others, but al&s;o his peace and in|ward &s;atisfaction entirely depend upon his &s;trict ob&s;ervance of them; and that a mind will never be able to bear its own &s;urvey, that has been wanting in its part to man|kind and &s;ociety? But I forbear in&s;i&s;ting on this &s;ubject. Such reflections require a work a-part, very different from the genius of the pre&s;ent. The anatomi&s;t ought never to emu|late the painter; nor in his accurate di&s;|&s;ections and portraitures of the &s;maller parts of the human body, pretend to give his figures any graceful and engaging attitude or expre&s;&s;ion. There is even &s;omething hideous, or at lea&s;t minute in the views of things, which he pre&s;ents; and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary the ob|jects &s;hou'd be &s;et more at a di&s;tance, and be more cover'd up from &s;ight, to make them engaging to the eye and imagination. An
<PB N="281" REF="289">
anatomi&s;t, however, is admirably fitted to give advice to a painter; and 'tis even im|practicable to excel in the latter art, with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the former. We mu&s;t have an exact knowledge of the parts, their &s;ituation and connexion, before we can de|&s;ign with any elegance or correctne&s;s. And thus the mo&s;t ab&s;tract &s;peculations concern|ing human nature, however cold and un|entertaining, become &s;ub&s;ervient to <HI>practi|cal morality;</HI> and may render this latter &s;ci|ence more correct in its precepts, and more per&s;ua&s;ive in its exhortations.</P>

<P>_THERE is nothing I wou'd more willingly lay hold of, than an op|portunity of confe&s;&s;ing my errors; and &s;hou'd e&s;teem &s;uch a return to truth and rea&s;on to be more honourable than the mo&s;t unerring judgment. A man, who is free from mi&s;takes, can pretend to no prai&s;es, ex|cept from the ju&s;tne&s;s of his under&s;tanding: But a man, who corrects his mi&s;takes, &s;hews at once the ju&s;tne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and the candour and ingenuity of his temper. I have not yet been &s;o fortunate as to di&s;|cover any very con&s;iderable mi&s;takes in the rea&s;onings deliver'd in the preceding volumes, except on one article: But I have found by experience, that &s;ome of my expre&s;&s;ions have not been &s;o well cho&s;en, as to guard again&s;t all mi&s;takes in the readers; and 'tis chiefly to remedy this defect, I have &s;ubjoin'd the following appendix.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="291">
WE can never be induc'd to believe any matter of fact, except where its cau&s;e, or its effect, is pre&s;ent to us; but what the na|ture is of that belief, which ari&s;es from the relation of cau&s;e and effect, few have had the curio&s;ity to a&s;k them&s;elves. In my opinion, this dilemma is inevitable. Either the belief is &s;ome new idea, &s;uch as that of <HI>reality</HI> or <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> which we join to the &s;imple conception of an object, or it is merely a peculiar <HI>feeling</HI> or <HI>&s;entiment.</HI> That it is not a new idea, annex'd to the &s;imple con|ception, may be evinc'd from the&s;e two ar|guments. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We have no ab&s;tract idea of exi&s;tence, di&s;tingui&s;hable and &s;eparable from the idea of particular objects. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that this idea of ex|i&s;tence can be annex'd to the idea of any object, or form the difference betwixt a &s;im|ple conception and belief. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The mind has the command over all its ideas, and can &s;eparate, unite, mix, and vary them, as it plea&s;es; &s;o that if belief con&s;i&s;ted merely in a new idea, annex'd to the conception, it wou'd be in a man's power to believe what he pleas'd. We may, therefore, conclude, that belief con&s;i&s;ts merely in a certain feel|ing or &s;entiment; in &s;omething, that de|pends
<PB N="285" REF="292">
not on the will, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from certain determinate cau&s;es and principles, of which we are not ma&s;ters. When we are convinc'd of any matter of fact, we do no|thing but conceive it, along with a certain feeling, different from what attends the mere <HI>reveries</HI> of the imagination. And when we expre&s;s our incredulity concerning any fact, we mean, that the arguments for the fact produce not that feeling. Did not the belief con&s;i&s;t in a &s;entiment different from our mere conception, whatever objects were pre|&s;ented by the wilde&s;t imagination, wou'd be on an equal footing with the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd truths founded on hi&s;tory and experience. There is nothing but the feeling, or &s;en|timent, to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other.</P>
<P>THIS, therefore, being regarded as an undoubted truth, <HI>that belief is nothing but a peculiar feeling, different from the &s;imple con|ception,</HI> the next que&s;tion, that naturally oc|curs, is, <HI>what is the nature of this feeling, or &s;entiment, and whether it be analogous to any other &s;entiment of the human mind?</HI> This que&s;tion is important. For if it be not ana|logous to any other &s;entiment, we mu&s;t de|&s;pair of explaining its cau&s;es, and mu&s;t con|&s;ider it as an original principle of the human
<PB N="286" REF="293">
mind. If it be analogous, we may hope to explain its cau&s;es from analogy, and trace it up to more general principles. Now that there is a greater firmne&s;s and &s;olidity in the conceptions, which are the objects of con|viction and a&s;&s;urance, than in the loo&s;e and indolent reveries of a ca&s;tle-builder, every one will readily own. They &s;trike upon us with more force; they are more pre&s;ent to us; the mind has a firmer hold of them, and is more actuated and mov'd by them. It acquie&s;ces in them; and, in a manner, fixes and repo&s;es it&s;elf on them. In &s;hort, they approach nearer to the impre&s;&s;ions, which are immediately pre&s;ent to us; and are therefore analogous to many other opera|tions of the mind.</P>
<P>THERE is not, in my opinion, any po&s;&s;i|bility of evading this conclu&s;ion, but by a&s;&s;erting, that belief, be&s;ide the &s;imple con|ception, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion or feel|ing, di&s;tingui&s;hable from the conception. It does not modify the conception, and render it more pre&s;ent and inten&s;e: It is only an|nex'd to it, after the &s;ame manner that <HI>will</HI> and <HI>de&s;ire</HI> are annex'd to particular con|ceptions of good and plea&s;ure. But the fol|lowing con&s;iderations will, I hope, be &s;uffi|cient to remove this hypothe&s;is. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is
<PB N="287" REF="294">
directly contrary to experience, and our im|mediate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. All men have ever allow'd rea&s;oning to be merely an operation of our thoughts or ideas; and however tho&s;e ideas may be varied to the feeling, there is nothing ever enters into our <HI>conclu&s;ions</HI> but ideas, or our fainter conceptions. For in|&s;tance; I hear at pre&s;ent a per&s;on's voice, whom I am acquainted with; and this &s;ound comes from the next room. This impre&s;&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es immediately conveys my thoughts to the per&s;on, along with all the &s;urrounding objects. I paint them out to my&s;elf as exi&s;tent at pre&s;ent, with the &s;ame qualities and relations, that I formerly knew them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. The&s;e ideas take fa&s;ter hold of my mind, than the ideas of an in|chanted ca&s;tle. They are different to the feeling; but there is no di&s;tinct or &s;eparate impre&s;&s;ion attending them. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e when I recollect the &s;everal incidents of a journey, or the events of any hi&s;tory. Every particular fact is there the object of belief. Its idea is modified differently from the loo&s;e reveries of a ca&s;tle-builder: But no di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion attends every di&s;tinct idea, or conception of matter of fact. This is the &s;ubject of plain experience. If ever this experience can be di&s;puted on any oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="288" REF="295">
'tis when the mind has been agitated with doubts and difficulties; and afterwards, upon taking the object in a new point of view, or being pre&s;ented with a new argu|ment, fixes and repo&s;es it&s;elf in one &s;ettled conclu&s;ion and belief. In this ca&s;e there is a feeling di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from the con|ception. The pa&s;&s;age from doubt and agi|tation to tranquility and repo&s;e, conveys a &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure to the mind. But take any other ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e I &s;ee the legs and thighs of a per&s;on in motion, while &s;ome interpos'd object conceals the re&s;t of his body. Here 'tis certain, the imagination &s;preads out the whole figure. I give him a head and &s;houlders, and brea&s;t and neck. The&s;e members I conceive and believe him to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. Nothing can be more evident, than that this whole operation is perform'd by the thought or imagination alone. The tran&s;ition is immediate. The ideas pre&s;ently &s;trike us. Their cu&s;tomary connexion with the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, varies them and modifies them in a certain manner, but produces no act of the mind, di&s;tinct from this peculiarity of conception. Let any one examine his own mind, and he will evidently find this to be the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="296">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Whatever may be the ca&s;e, with regard to this di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be allow'd, that the mind has a firmer hold, or more &s;teady conception of what it takes to be matter of fact, than of fictions. Why then look any farther, or multiply &s;uppo|&s;itions without nece&s;&s;ity?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We can explain the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of the firm conception, but not tho&s;e of any &s;eparate impre&s;&s;ion. And not only &s;o, but the cau&s;es of the firm conception exhau&s;t the whole &s;ubject, and nothing is left to produce any other effect. An inference con|cerning a matter of fact is nothing but the idea of an object, that is frequently con|join'd, or is a&s;&s;ociated with a pre&s;ent im|pre&s;&s;ion. This is the whole of it. Every part is requi&s;ite to explain, from analogy, the more &s;teady conception; and nothing re|mains capable of producing any di&s;tinct im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>effects</HI> of belief, in in|fluencing the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination, can all be explain'd from the firm conception; and there is no occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to any other principle. The&s;e arguments, with many others, enumerated in the foregoing volumes, &s;ufficiently prove, that belief only modifies the idea or conception; and renders
<PB N="290" REF="297">
it different to the feeling, without producing any di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THUS upon a general view of the &s;ub|ject, there appear to be two que&s;tions of importance, which we may venture to re|commend to the con&s;ideration of philo&s;o|phers, <HI>Whether there be any thing to di&s;tin|gui&s;h belief from the &s;imple conception be&s;ide the feeling or &s;entiment?</HI> And, <HI>Whether this feeling be any thing but a firmer conception, or a fa&s;ter hold, that we take of the object?</HI></P>
<P>IF, upon impartial enquiry, the &s;ame con|clu&s;ion, that I have form'd, be a&s;&s;ented to by philo&s;ophers, the next bu&s;ine&s;s is to ex|amine the analogy, which there is betwixt belief, and other acts of the mind, and find the cau&s;e of the firmne&s;s and &s;trength of conception: And this I do not e&s;teem a difficult ta&s;k. The tran&s;ition from a pre|&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, always enlivens and &s;trength|ens any idea. When any object is pre&s;ented, the idea of its u&s;ual attendant immediately &s;trikes us, as &s;omething real and &s;olid. 'Tis <HI>felt,</HI> rather than conceiv'd, and approaches the impre&s;&s;ion, from which it is deriv'd, in its force and influence. This I have prov'd at large. I cannot add any new arguments; tho' perhaps my rea&s;oning on this whole que&s;tion, concerning cau&s;e and effect, wou'd
<PB N="291" REF="298">
have been more convincing, had the follow|ing pa&s;&s;ages been in&s;erted in the places, which I have mark'd for them. I have ad|ded a few illu&s;trations on other points, where I thought it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>IT frequently happens, that when two men have been engag'd in any &s;cene of ac|tion, the one &s;hall remember it much better than the other, and &s;hall have all the diffi|culty in the world to make his companion recollect it. He runs over &s;everal circum|&s;tances in vain; mentions the time, the place, the company, what was &s;aid, what was done on all &s;ides; till at la&s;t he hits on &s;ome lucky circum&s;tance, that revives the whole, and gives his friend a perfect memory of every thing. Here the per&s;on that forgets receives at fir&s;t all the ideas from the di&s;|cour&s;e of the other, with the &s;ame circum|&s;tances of time and place; tho' he con&s;iders them as mere fictions of the imagination. But as &s;oon as the circum&s;tance is mention'd, that touches the memory, the very &s;ame ideas now appear in a new light, and have,
<PB N="292" REF="299">
in a manner, a different feeling from what they had before. Without any other alter|ation, be&s;ide that of the feeling, they become immediately ideas of the memory, and are a&s;&s;ented to.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the imagination can re|pre&s;ent all the &s;ame objects that the memory can offer to us, and &s;ince tho&s;e faculties are only di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the different <HI>feeling</HI> of the ideas they pre&s;ent, it may be proper to con&s;ider what is the nature of that feeling.

<P>THIS operation of the mind, which forms the belief of any matter of fact, &s;eems hitherto to have been one of the greate&s;t my&s;teries of philo&s;ophy; tho' no one has &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, that there was any diffi|culty in explaining it. For my part I mu&s;t own, that I find a con&s;iderable difficulty in the ca&s;e; and that even when I think I under&s;tand the &s;ubject perfectly, I am at a
<PB N="293" REF="300">
lo&s;s for terms to expre&s;s my meaning. I conclude, by an induction which &s;eems to me very evident, that an opinion or belief is nothing but an idea, that is different from a fiction, not in the nature, or the order of its parts, but in the <HI>manner</HI> of its being con|ceiv'd. But when I wou'd explain this <HI>man|ner,</HI> I &s;carce find any word that fully an|&s;wers the ca&s;e, but am oblig'd to have re|cour&s;e to every one's feeling, in order to give him a perfect notion of this operation of the mind. An idea a&s;&s;ented to <HI>feels</HI> different from a fictitious idea, that the fancy alone pre&s;ents to us: And this different feeling I endeavour to explain by calling it a &s;uperior <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>vivacity,</HI> or <HI>&s;olidity,</HI> or <HI>firmne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>&s;teadine&s;s.</HI> This variety of terms, which may &s;eem &s;o unphilo&s;ophical, is intended only to expre&s;s that act of the mind, which renders realities more pre&s;ent to us than fictions, cau&s;es them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a &s;uperior influence on the pa&s;&s;ions and imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, 'tis needle&s;s to di&s;pute about the terms. The imagination has the com|mand over all its ideas, and can join, and mix, and vary them in all the ways po&s;&s;ible. It may conceive objects with all the circum|&s;tances of place and time. It may &s;et them,
<PB N="294" REF="301">
in a manner, before our eyes in their true colours, ju&s;t as they might have exi&s;ted. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible, that that faculty can ever, of it&s;elf, reach belief, 'tis evident, that belief con&s;i&s;ts not in the nature and order of our ideas, but in the manner of their con|ception, and in their feeling to the mind. I confe&s;s, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to explain per|fectly this feeling or manner of conception. We may make u&s;e of words, that expre&s;s &s;omething near it. But its true and proper name is <HI>belief,</HI> which is a term that every one &s;ufficiently under&s;tands in common life. And in philo&s;ophy we can go no farther, than a&s;&s;ert, that it is &s;omething <HI>felt</HI> by the mind, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of the imagina|tion. It gives them more force and influ|ence; makes them appear of greater im|portance; infixes them in the mind; and renders them the governing principles of all our actions.</P>

<P>WE may ob&s;erve the &s;ame effect of poe|try in a le&s;&s;er degree; and this is common both to poetry and madne&s;s, that the vivacity they be&s;tow on the ideas is not deriv'd from the particular &s;ituations or connexions of the objects of the&s;e ideas, but from the pre&s;ent temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on. But
<PB N="296" REF="303">
how great &s;oever the pitch may be, to which this vivacity ri&s;e, 'tis evident, that in poetry it never has the &s;ame <HI>feeling</HI> with that which ari&s;es in the mind, when we rea&s;on, tho' even upon the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of proba|bility. The mind can ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h be|twixt the one and the other; and whatever emotion the poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m may give to the &s;pirits, 'tis &s;till the mere phantom of belief or per&s;ua&s;ion. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the idea, as with the pa&s;&s;ion it occa|&s;ions. There is no pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind but what may ari&s;e from poetry; tho' at the &s;ame time the <HI>feelings</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ions are very different when excited by poetical fictions, from what they are when they ari&s;e from belief and reality. A pa&s;&s;ion, which is di&s;agreeable in real life, may afford the highe&s;t entertainment in a tragedy, or epic poem. In the latter ca&s;e it lies not with that weight upon us: It feels le&s;s firm and &s;olid: And has no other than the agreeable effect of exciting the &s;pirits, and rouzing the at|tention. The difference in the pa&s;&s;ions is a clear proof of a like difference in tho&s;e ideas, from which the pa&s;&s;ions are deriv'd. Where the vivacity ari&s;es from a cu&s;tomary con|junction with a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion; tho' the imagination may not, in appearance, be &s;o
<PB N="297" REF="304">
much mov'd; yet there is always &s;omething more forcible and real in its actions, than in the fervors of poetry and eloquence. The force of our mental actions in this ca&s;e, no more than in any other, is not to be mea|&s;ur'd by the apparent agitation of the mind. A poetical de&s;cription may have a more &s;en|&s;ible effect on the fancy, than an hi&s;torical narration. It may collect more of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, that form a compleat image or picture. It may &s;eem to &s;et the object be|fore us in more lively colours. But &s;till the ideas it pre&s;ents are different to the <HI>feeling</HI> from tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the memory and the judgment. There is &s;omething weak and imperfect amid&s;t all that &s;eeming vehe|mence of thought and &s;entiment, which at|tends the fictions of poetry.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to re|mark both the re&s;emblances and differences betwixt a poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m, and a &s;erious conviction. In the mean time I cannot for|bear ob&s;erving, that the great difference in their feeling proceeds in &s;ome mea&s;ure from reflection and <HI>general rules.</HI> We ob&s;erve, that the vigour of conception, which fictions receive from poetry and eloquence, is a cir|cum&s;tance merely accidental, of which every idea is equally &s;u&s;ceptible; and that &s;uch
<PB N="298" REF="305">
fictions are connected with nothing that is real. This ob&s;ervation makes us only lend our&s;elves, &s;o to &s;peak, to the fiction: But cau&s;es the idea to feel very different from the eternal e&s;tabli&s;h'd per&s;ua&s;ions founded on memory and cu&s;tom. They are &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind: But the one is much in|ferior to the other, both in its cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P>A LIKE reflection on <HI>general rules</HI> keeps us from augmenting our belief upon every encrea&s;e of the force and vivacity of our ideas. Where an opinion admits of no doubt, or oppo&s;ite probability, we attribute to it a full conviction; tho' the want of re&s;emblance, or contiguity, may render its force inferior to that of other opinions. 'Tis thus the under&s;tanding corrects the appearances of the &s;en&s;es, and makes us imagine, that an object at twenty foot di&s;tance &s;eems even to the eye as large as one of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions at ten.</P>

<P>SOME have a&s;&s;erted, that we feel an energy, or power, in our own mind; and
<PB N="299" REF="306">
that having in this manner acquir'd the idea of power, we transfer that quality to matter, where we are not able immediately to di&s;co|ver it. The motions of our body, and the thoughts and &s;entiments of our mind, (&s;ay they) obey the will; nor do we &s;eek any far|ther to acquire a ju&s;t notion of force or power. But to convince us how fallacious this rea|&s;oning is, we need only con&s;ider, that the will being here con&s;ider'd as a cau&s;e, has no more a di&s;coverable connexion with its effects, than any material cau&s;e has with its proper effect. So far from perceiving the connexion betwixt an act of volition, and a motion of the body; 'tis allow'd that no effect is more inexplicable from the powers and e&s;&s;ence of thought and matter. Nor is the empire of the will over our mind more intelligible. The effect is there di&s;tingui&s;hable and &s;epa|rable from the cau&s;e, and cou'd not be fore|&s;een without the experience of their con&s;tant conjunction. We have command over our mind to a certain degree, but beyond <HI>that</HI> lo&s;e all empire over it: And 'tis evidently impo&s;&s;ible to fix any preci&s;e bounds to our authority, where we con&s;ult not experience.

can we ever rea&s;on beyond it. No internal impre&s;&s;ion has an apparent energy, more than external objects have.

We have, therefore, no idea of them in that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is di&s;tinct, is di&s;tingui&s;h|able; and whatever is di&s;tingui&s;hable, is &s;e|parable by the thought or imagination. All perceptions are di&s;tinct.

<P>WHEN I view this table and that chim|ney, nothing is pre&s;ent to me but parti|cular perceptions, which are of a like na|ture with all the other perceptions.

therefore, in extending the &s;ame doctrine to all the perceptions.</P>
<P>IN general, the following rea&s;oning &s;eems &s;atisfactory. All ideas are borrow'd from preceding perceptions. Our ideas of objects, therefore, are deriv'd from that &s;ource. Con|&s;equently no propo&s;ition can be intelligible or con&s;i&s;tent with regard to objects, which is not &s;o with regard to perceptions. But 'tis intelligible and con&s;i&s;tent to &s;ay, that objects exi&s;t di&s;tinct and independent, with|out any common <HI>&s;imple</HI> &s;ub&s;tance or &s;ubject of inhe&s;ion.

<P>WE can conceive a thinking being to have either many or few perceptions. Suppo&s;e the mind to be reduc'd even below the life of an oy&s;ter.

<PB N="303" REF="310">
addition of other perceptions can never give you that notion.</P>
<P>THE annihilation, which &s;ome people &s;uppo&s;e to follow upon death, and which entirely de&s;troys this &s;elf, is nothing but an extinction of all particular perceptions; love and hatred, pain and plea&s;ure, thought and &s;en&s;ation. The&s;e therefore mu&s;t be the &s;ame with &s;elf; &s;ince the one cannot &s;urvive the other.</P>
<P>IS <HI>&s;elf</HI> the &s;ame with <HI>&s;ub&s;tance?</HI> If it be, how can that que&s;tion have place, concern|ing the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of &s;elf, under a change of &s;ub&s;tance? If they be di&s;tinct, what is the difference betwixt them? For my part, I have a notion of neither, when conceiv'd di&s;tinct from particular perceptions.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS begin to be reconcil'd to the principle, <HI>that we have no idea of exter|nal &s;ub&s;tance, di&s;tinct from the ideas of par|ticular qualities.</HI> This mu&s;t pave the way for a like principle with regard to the mind, <HI>that we have no notion of it, di&s;tinct from the particular perceptions.</HI></P>
<P>So far I &s;eem to be attended with &s;uffi|cient evidence. But having thus loo&s;en'd all our particular perceptions, when <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. page 452.</NOTE> I proceed to explain the principle of connexion, which
<PB N="304" REF="311">
binds them together, and makes us attribute to them a real &s;implicity and identity; I am &s;en&s;ible, that my account is very de|fective, and that nothing but the &s;eeming evidence of the precedent rea&s;onings cou'd have induc'd me to receive it. If perceptions are di&s;tinct exi&s;tences, they form a whole only by being connected together. But no connexions among di&s;tinct exi&s;tences are ever di&s;coverable by human under&s;tanding. We only <HI>feel</HI> a connexion or determination of the thought, to pa&s;s from one object to another. It follows, therefore, that the thought alone finds per&s;onal identity, when reflecting on the train of pa&s;t perceptions, that compo&s;e a mind, the ideas of them are felt to be connected together, and naturally introduce each other. However extraordi|nary this conclu&s;ion may &s;eem, it need not &s;urprize us. Mo&s;t philo&s;ophers &s;eem inclin'd to think, that per&s;onal identity <HI>ari&s;es</HI> from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The pre&s;ent philo&s;ophy, therefore, has &s;o far a promi&s;ing a&s;pect. But all my hopes vani&s;h, when I come to explain the principles, that unite our &s;ucce&s;&s;ive perceptions in our thought or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. I cannot di&s;cover any theory, which gives me &s;atisfaction on this head.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="312">
IN &s;hort there are two principles, which I cannot render con&s;i&s;tent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz. <HI>that all our di&s;tinct perceptions are di&s;tinct exi&s;t|ences,</HI> and <HI>that the mind never perceives any real connexion among di&s;tinct exi&s;tences.</HI> Did our perceptions either inhere in &s;omething &s;imple and individual, or did the mind per|ceive &s;ome real connexion among them, there wou'd be no difficulty in the ca&s;e. For my part, I mu&s;t plead the privilege of a &s;ceptic, and confe&s;s, that this difficulty is too hard for my under&s;tanding. I pretend not, how|ever, to pronounce it ab&s;olutely in&s;uperable. Others, perhaps, or my&s;elf, upon more ma|ture reflections, may di&s;cover &s;ome hypo|the&s;is, that will reconcile tho&s;e contra|dictions.</P>
<P>I SHALL al&s;o take this opportunity of confe&s;&s;ing two other errors of le&s;s import|ance, which more mature reflection has di&s;|cover'd to me in my rea&s;oning. The fir&s;t may be found in Vol. I. page 107. where I &s;ay, that the di&s;tance betwixt two bodies is known, among other things, by the angles, which the rays of light flowing from the bodies make with each other. 'Tis certain, that the&s;e angles are not known to the mind, and con&s;equently can never di&s;cover the
<PB N="306" REF="313">
di&s;tance. The &s;econd error may be found in Vol. I. page 171. where I &s;ay, that two ideas of the &s;ame object can only be differ|ent by their different degrees of force and vivacity. I believe there are other differences among ideas, which cannot properly be com|prehended under the&s;e terms. Had I &s;aid, that two ideas of the &s;ame object can only be different by their different <HI>feeling,</HI> I &s;hou'd have been nearer the truth.</P>
<P>THERE are two errors of the pre&s;s, which affect the &s;en&s;e, and therefore the reader is de&s;ir'd to correct them. In Vol. I. page 332. line penult. for <HI>as the perception</HI> read <HI>a per|ception.</HI> In Vol. I. p. 447. line 5. for <HI>moral</HI> read <HI>natural.</HI></P>

<P>'TIS evident, that even different &s;imple ideas may have a &s;imilarity or re&s;emblance to each other; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, that the point or circum&s;tance of re&s;emblance &s;hou'd be di&s;tinct or &s;eparable from that in which they differ. <HI>Blue</HI> and <HI>green</HI> are different &s;imple ideas, but are more re&s;embling than <HI>blue</HI> and <HI>&s;carlet;</HI> tho' their perfect &s;impli|city excludes all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparation or

<P>THERE are many philo&s;ophers, who re|fu&s;e to a&s;&s;ign any &s;tandard of <HI>equality,</HI> but a&s;&s;ert, that 'tis &s;ufficient to pre&s;ent two ob|jects, that are equal, in order to give us a ju&s;t notion of this proportion.

<PB N="308" REF="315">
perceive &s;uch objects, we no longer &s;tand in need of any definition. To this rea&s;oning I entirely agree; and a&s;&s;ert, that the only u&s;eful notion of equality, or inequality, is deriv'd from the whole united appearance and the compari&s;on of particular objects.

<P>To whatever &s;ide mathematicians turn, this dilemma &s;till meets them. If they judge of equality, or any other proportion, by the accurate and exact &s;tandard, <HI>viz.</HI> the enu|meration of the minute indivi&s;ible parts, they both employ a &s;tandard, which is u&s;e|le&s;s in practice, and actually e&s;tabli&s;h the in|divi&s;ibility of exten&s;ion, which they endea|vour to explode. Or if they employ, as is u&s;ual, the inaccurate &s;tandard, deriv'd from a compari&s;on of objects, upon their general appearance, corrected by mea&s;uring and juxta po&s;ition; their fir&s;t principles, tho' certain and infallible, are too coar&s;e to afford any &s;uch &s;ubtile inferences as they commonly draw from them. The fir&s;t principles are founded on the imagination and &s;en&s;es: The

<P>As long as we confine our &s;peculations to <HI>the appearances</HI> of objects to our &s;en&s;es, with|out entering into di&s;qui&s;itions concerning their real nature and operations, we are &s;afe from all difficulties, and can never be embarra&s;s'd by any que&s;tion. Thus, if it be a&s;k'd, if the invi&s;ible and intangible di&s;tance, interpos'd betwixt two objects, be &s;omething or no|thing: 'Tis ea&s;y to an&s;wer, that it is <HI>&s;ome|thing,</HI> viz. a property of the objects, which affect the <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> after &s;uch a particular man|ner. If it be a&s;k'd, whether two objects, having &s;uch a di&s;tance betwixt them, touch or not: It may be an&s;wer'd, that this de|pends upon the definition of the word, <HI>touch.</HI> If objects be &s;aid to touch, when there is nothing <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> interpos'd betwixt them, the&s;e objects touch: If objects be &s;aid to touch, when their <HI>images</HI> &s;trike contiguous parts of the eye, and when the hand <HI>feels</HI> both objects &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any inter|pos'd motion, the&s;e objects do not touch. The appearances of objects to our &s;en&s;es are
<PB N="310" REF="317">
all con&s;i&s;tent; and no difficulties can ever ari&s;e, but from the ob&s;curity of the terms we make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>IF we carry our enquiry beyond the ap|pearances of objects to the &s;en&s;es, I am afraid, that mo&s;t of our conclu&s;ions will be full of &s;ceptici&s;m and uncertainty. Thus if it be a&s;k'd, whether or not the invi&s;ible and intangible di&s;tance be always full of <HI>body,</HI> or of &s;omething that by an improvement of our organs might become vi&s;ible or tangible, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I find no very de|ci&s;ive arguments on either &s;ide; tho' I am inclin'd to the contrary opinion, as being more &s;uitable to vulgar and popular notions. If <HI>the Newtonian</HI> philo&s;ophy be rightly un|der&s;tood, it will be found to mean no more. A vacuum is a&s;&s;erted: That is, bodies are &s;aid to be plac'd after &s;uch a manner, as to receive bodies betwixt them, without impul|&s;ion or penetration. The real nature of this po&s;ition of bodies is unknown. We are only acquainted with its effects on the &s;en&s;es, and its power of receiving body. Nothing is more &s;uitable to that philo&s;ophy, than a mode&s;t &s;ceptici&s;m to a certain degree, and a fair confe&s;&s;ion of ignorance in &s;ubjects, that exceed all human capacity.</P>
