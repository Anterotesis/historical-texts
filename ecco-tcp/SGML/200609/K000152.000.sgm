<HEAD>PROLOGUE
TO THE
COURT;
On the QUEEN's Birth-Day, 1704.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Happy Mu&s;e to this high Scene preferr'd,</L>
<L>Hereafter &s;hall in Loftier Strains be heard;</L>
<L>And, &s;oaring to tran&s;cend her u&s;ual Theme,</L>
<L>Shall Sing of Virtue and Heroick Fame.</L>
<L>No longer &s;hall &s;he Toil upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And fruitle&s;s War with Vice and Folly wage;</L>
<L>No more in mean Di&s;gui&s;e &s;he &s;hall appear,</L>
<L>And Shapes &s;he would reform be forc'd to wear:</L>
<L>While Ignorance and Malice join to blame,</L>
<L>And break the Mirror that reflects their Shame.</L>
<L>Henceforth &s;he &s;hall pur&s;ue a Nobler Task,</L>
<L>Shew her bright Virgin Face, and &s;corn the Satyr's Mask.</L>
<L>Happy her future Days! which are de&s;ign'd</L>
<L>Alone to Paint the Beauties of the Mind.</L>
<L>By Ju&s;t Originals to draw with Care,</L>
<L>And Copy from the Court a Faultle&s;s Fair:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2">Such Labours with Succe&s;s her Hopes may crown,</L>
<L>And &s;hame to Manners an incorrigible Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While this De&s;ign her eager Thought pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Such various Virtues all around she views,</L>
<L>She knows not where to fix, or which to chu&s;e.</L>
<L>Yet &s;till ambitious of the daring Flight,</L>
<L>ONE only awes her with Superior Light.</L>
<L>From that Attempt the Con&s;cious Mu&s;e retires,</L>
<L>Nor to Inimitable Worth a&s;pires;</L>
<L>But &s;ecretly Applauds, and &s;ilently Admires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence &s;he reflects upon the genial Ray</L>
<L>That fir&s;t enliven'd this Au&s;picious Day:</L>
<L>On that Bright Star, to who&s;e Indulgent Pow'r</L>
<L>We owe the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Pre&s;ent Hour.</L>
<L>Concurring Omens of propitious Fate</L>
<L>Bore, with One Sacred Birth, an equal Date;</L>
<L>Whence we derive whatever we po&s;&s;e&s;s,</L>
<L>By Foreign Conque&s;t, or Dome&s;tick Peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, <HI>Britain,</HI> then thy Dawn of Bli&s;s begun!</L>
<L>Then broke the Morn that lighted up this Sun!</L>
<L>Then was it doom'd who&s;e Councils &s;hould &s;ucceed;</L>
<L>And by who&s;e Arm the Chri&s;tian World be freed;</L>
<L>Then the fierce Foe was pre-ordain'd to yield,</L>
<L>And then the Battel won at BLENHEIM'S Glorious Field.</L>
