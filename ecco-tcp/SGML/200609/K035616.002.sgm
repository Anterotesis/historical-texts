<HEAD>CHAP. X. Congruity and Propriety.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the brute creation, not more re|markably by the &s;uperiority of his rational faculties, than by the greater delicacy of his perceptions and feelings. With re&s;pect to the gro&s;s plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, man probably has little &s;upe|riority over other animals. Some ob&s;cure perception of beauty may al&s;o fall to their &s;hare. But they are probably not acquaint|ed with the more delicate conceptions of regularity, order, uniformity, or congruity.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Such refined conceptions, being connected with morality and religion, are re&s;erved to dignify the chief of the terre&s;trial creation. Upon this account, no di&s;cipline is more &s;uitable to man, or more <HI>congruous</HI> to the dignity of his nature, than that by which his ta&s;te is refined, to di&s;tingui&s;h in every &s;ubject, what is regular, what is orderly, what is &s;uitable, and what is fit and pro|per<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">Nec vero illa parva vis naturae e&s;t rationi&s;que, quod u|num hoc animal &s;entit quid &s;it ordo, quid &s;it quod deceat in fa|ctis dicti&s;que, qui modus.

<P>No di&s;cerning per&s;on can be at a lo&s;s a|bout the meaning of the terms <HI>congruity</HI> and <HI>propriety,</HI> when applied to dre&s;s, beha|viour, or language; that a decent grab, for example, is proper for a judge, mode&s;t behaviour for a young woman, and a lofty
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;tyle for an epic poem. In the following examples every one is &s;en&s;ible of an un&s;uit|ablene&s;s or incongruity: a little woman &s;unk in an overgrown farthingale, a coat richly embroidered covering coar&s;e and dirty li|nen, a mean &s;ubject in an elevated &s;tyle, or an elevated &s;ubject in a mean &s;tyle, a fir&s;t mini&s;ter darning his wife's &s;tocking, or a reverend prelate in lawn &s;leeves dancing a hornpipe.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;ufficient that the&s;e terms be under&s;tood in practice; the critical art re|quires, that their meaning be traced to its foundation in human nature. The rela|tions that connect objects together, have been examined in more than one view. Their influence in directing the train of our perceptions, is handled in the fir&s;t chapter; and in the &s;econd, their influence in genera|ting pa&s;&s;ion. Here they mu&s;t be handled in a new view; for they are clearly the oc|ca&s;ion of congruity and propriety. We are &s;o framed by nature, as to require a certain &s;uitablene&s;s or corre&s;pondence among things connected by any relation. This &s;uitable|ne&s;s or corre&s;pondence is termed <HI>congruity</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
or <HI>propriety</HI>; and the want of it, <HI>incongrui|ty</HI> or <HI>impropriety.</HI> Among the many prin|ciples that compo&s;e the nature of man, a &s;en&s;e of congruity or propriety is one. De|&s;titute of this &s;en&s;e, we could have no no|tion of congruity or propriety: the terms to us would be unintelligible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From many things that pa&s;s current in the world with|out being generally condemned, one at fir&s;t view would ima|gine, that the &s;en&s;e of congruity or propriety hath &s;earce any foundation in nature; and that it is rather an artificial refine|ment of tho&s;e who affect to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by a certain delicacy of ta&s;te and behaviour. The ful&s;ome panegyrics be|&s;towed upon the great and opulent, in epi&s;tles dedicatory and other &s;uch compo&s;itions, lead naturally to that thought. Did there prevail in the world, it will be &s;aid, or did nature &s;ug|ge&s;t, a ta&s;te of what is &s;uitable, decent, or proper, would a|ny good writer deal in &s;uch compo&s;itions, or any man of &s;en&s;e receive them without di&s;gu&s;t? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Lewis XIV. of France was endued by nature with any &s;en&s;e of propriety, when, in a dramatic performance purpo&s;ely com|po&s;ed for his entertainment, he &s;uffered him&s;elf, publicly and in his pre&s;ence, to be &s;tyled the greate&s;t king ever the earth produced? The&s;e it is true are &s;trong facts; but luckily they do not prove the &s;en&s;e of propriety to be artificial. They on|ly prove, that the &s;en&s;e of propriety is at times overpowered by pride and vanity; which is no &s;ingular ca&s;e, for this &s;ome|times is the fate even of the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As this &s;en&s;e is di&s;played upon relations, it is rea&s;onable beforehand to expect, that
<PB N="7" REF="6">
we &s;hould be &s;o formed, as to require among connected objects a degree of congruity pro|portioned to the degree of the relation. And upon examination we find this to hold in fact. Where the relation is &s;trong and intimate as betwixt a cau&s;e and its effect, a body and its members, we require that the things be &s;uited to each other in the &s;tricte&s;t manner. On the other hand, where the relation is &s;light, or accidental, as among things jumbled together in the &s;ame place, we demand little or no congruity. The &s;tricte&s;t propriety is required in behaviour and manner of living; becau&s;e a man is con|nected with the&s;e by the relation of cau&s;e and effect. The &s;ituation of a great hou&s;e ought to be lofty; for the relation betwixt an edifice and the ground it &s;tands upon, is of the mo&s;t intimate kind. Its relation to neighbouring hills, rivers, plains, being that of propinquity only, demands but a &s;mall &s;hare of congruity. Among members of the &s;ame club, the congruity ought to be con&s;iderable, as well as among things pla|ced for &s;how in the &s;ame niche. Among pa&s;&s;engers in a &s;tage-coach, we require ve|ry
<PB N="8" REF="7">
little congruity; and le&s;s &s;till at a public &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>Congruity is &s;o nearly allied to beauty, as commonly to be held a &s;pecies of it. And yet they differ &s;o e&s;&s;entially, as never to co|incide. Beauty, like colour, is placed upon a &s;ingle &s;ubject; congruity upon a plurality. Further, a thing beautiful in it&s;elf, may, with relation to other things, produce the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of incongruity.</P>
<P>Congruity and propriety are commonly reckoned &s;ynonymous terms; and hitherto in opening the &s;ubject they are u&s;ed indiffer|ently. But they are di&s;tingui&s;hable; and the preci&s;e meaning of each mu&s;t be a&s;cer|tained. Congruity is the genus, of which propriety is a &s;pecies. For we call nothing propriety, but that congruity or &s;uitablene&s;s which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t betwixt &s;en&s;ible be|ings and their thoughts, words, and actions.</P>
<P>In order to give a full view of this &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall trace it through &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable relations. The relation of a part to the whole, being extremely inti|mate, demands the utmo&s;t degree of con|gruity. For that rea&s;on, the &s;lighte&s;t devia|tion
<PB N="9" REF="8">
is di&s;gu&s;tful. Every one mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible of a gro&s;s incongruity in the <HI>Lutrin,</HI> a burle&s;que poem, being clo&s;ed with a &s;erious and warm panegyric on Lamoignon, one of the King's judges:
<Q><L>&mdash;Amphora coepit</L>
<L>In&s;titui; currente rota, cur urceus exit?</L></Q></P>
<P>No relation affords more examples of congruity and incongruity, than that betwixt a &s;ubject and its ornaments. A literary per|formance intended merely for amu&s;ement, is &s;u&s;ceptible of much ornament, as well as a mu&s;ic-room or a play-hou&s;e. In gaiety, the mind hath a peculiar reli&s;h for &s;how and decoration. The mo&s;t gorgeous appa|rel, however un&s;uitable to an actor in a re|gular tragedy, di&s;gu&s;ts not at an opera. The truth is, an opera, in its pre&s;ent form, is a mighty fine thing; but as it deviates from nature in its capital circum&s;tances, we look not for any thing natural in tho&s;e which are acce&s;&s;ory. On the other hand, a &s;erious and important &s;ubject, admits not much or|nament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contrary to this rule, the introduction to the third vo|lume of the <HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> is a continued chain of metaphors. The&s;e in &s;uch profu&s;ion are too florid for the &s;ubject; and have be&s;ide the bad effect of removing our attention from the principal &s;ubject, to fix it upon &s;plendid trifles.</NOTE>: <PB N="10" REF="9">
nor a &s;ubject that of it&s;elf is ex|tremely beautiful. And a &s;ubject that fills the mind with its loftine&s;s and grandeur, appears be&s;t in a dre&s;s altogether plain.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on of a mean appearance, gor|geous apparel is un&s;uitable: which, be&s;ide the incongruity, has a bad effect; for by contra&s;t it &s;hows the meanne&s;s of appear|ance in the &s;tronge&s;t light. Sweetne&s;s of look and manner, requires &s;implicity of dre&s;s joined with the greate&s;t elegance. A &s;tately and maje&s;tic air requires &s;umptuous apparel, which ought not to be gaudy, or crowded with little ornaments. A woman of con&s;ummate beauty can bear to be highly adorned, and yet &s;hows be&s;t in a plain dre&s;s:
<Q><L>&mdash;For loveline&s;s</L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is when unadorn'd, adorn'd the mo&s;t.</L>
<BIBL>Thom&s;on's Autumn, 208.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
In judging of the propriety of ornament, we mu&s;t attend, not only to the nature of the &s;ubject that is to be adorned, but al&s;o to the circum&s;tances in which it is placed. The ornaments that are proper for a ball, will appear not altogether &s;o decent at pu|blic wor&s;hip; and the &s;ame per&s;on ought to dre&s;s differently for a marriage-fea&s;t and for a burial.</P>
<P>Nothing is more intimately related to a man, than his &s;entiments, words, and ac|tions; and therefore we require here the &s;tricte&s;t conformity. When we find what we thus require, we have a lively &s;en&s;e of pro|priety: when we find the contrary, our &s;en&s;e of impropriety is not le&s;s lively. Hence the univer&s;al di&s;ta&s;te of affectation, which con&s;i&s;ts in making a &s;hew of greater delica|cy and refinement than is &s;uited either to the character or circum&s;tances of the per&s;on. Nothing hath a wor&s;e effect in a &s;tory than impropriety of manners. In Corneille's tragedy of <HI>Cinna,</HI> Aemilia, a favourite of Augu&s;tus, receives daily marks of his affec|tion, and is loaded with benefits; yet all the while is laying plots to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her be|nefactor,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
directed by no other motive but to avenge her father's death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See act 1. &s;c. 2.</NOTE>. Revenge again&s;t a benefactor founded &s;olely upon filial piety, will never &s;ugge&s;t unlawful means; becau&s;e it can never exceed the bounds of ju&s;tice. And yet the crime here attempted, murder under tru&s;t repo&s;ed, is what even a mi&s;creant will &s;carce attempt again&s;t his bittere&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid may be thought &s;ufficient to explain the qualities of congruity and pro|priety. But the &s;ubject is not exhau&s;ted. On the contrary, the pro&s;pect enlarges up|on us, when we take under view the ef|fects the&s;e qualities produce in the mind. Congruity and propriety, where-ever percei|ved, appear agreeable; and every agreeable object produceth in the mind a plea&s;ant e|motion. Incongruity and impropriety, on the other hand, are di&s;agreeable; and con|&s;equently produce painful emotions. An emotion of this kind &s;ometimes vani&s;heth without any con&s;equence; but more fre|quently is the occa&s;ion of other emotions.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
When any &s;light incongruity is perceived in an accidental combination of per&s;ons or things, as of pa&s;&s;engers in a &s;tage-coach or of individuals dining at an ordinary, the e|motion of incongruity, after a momentary exi&s;tence, vani&s;heth without producing any effect. But this is not the ca&s;e of propriety and impropriety. Voluntary acts, whether words or deeds, are imputed to the au|thor: when proper, we reward him with our e&s;teem: when improper, we puni&s;h him with our contempt. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for example, an heroic action &s;uitable to the character of the author, which rai&s;es in him and in every &s;pectator the plea&s;ant e|motion of propriety. This emotion gene|rates in the author both &s;elf-e&s;teem and joy; the former when he con&s;iders his relation to the action, and the latter when he con&s;iders the good opinion that others will entertain of him. The &s;ame emotion of propriety, produceth in the &s;pectators, e&s;teem for the author of the action: and when they think of them&s;elves, it al&s;o produceth, by means of contra&s;t, an emotion of humility. To di&s;cover the effects of an un&s;uitable action,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
we mu&s;t invert each of the&s;e circum&s;tances. The painful emotion of impropriety, gene|rates in the author of the action both humi|lity and &s;hame; the former when he con|&s;iders his relation to the action, and the lat|ter when he con&s;iders what others will think of him. The &s;ame emotion of impropriety, produceth in the &s;pectators, contempt for the author of the action; and it al&s;o produceth, by means of contra&s;t when they think of them&s;elves, an emotion of &s;elf-e&s;teem. Here then are many different emotions, derived from the &s;ame action con&s;idered in different views by different per&s;ons; a machine pro|vided with many &s;prings, and not a little complicated. Propriety of action, it would &s;eem, is a chief favourite of nature, or of the author of nature, when &s;uch care and &s;olici|tude is be&s;towed upon it. It is not left to our own choice; but, like ju&s;tice, is requi|red at our hands; and, like ju&s;tice, infor|ced by natural rewards and puni&s;hments. A man cannot, with impunity, do any thing unbecoming or improper. He &s;uffers the cha&s;ti&s;ement of contempt inflicted by others, and of &s;hame inflicted by him&s;elf. An ap|paratus
<PB N="15" REF="14">
&s;o complicated and &s;o &s;ingular, ought to rou&s;e our attention. Nature doth nothing in vain; and we may conclude with great certainty, that this curious branch of the human con&s;titution is intended for &s;ome va|luable purpo&s;e. To the di&s;covery of this purpo&s;e I &s;hall with ardor apply my thoughts, after di&s;cour&s;ing a little more at large upon the puni&s;hment, for I may now call it &s;o, that Nature hath provided for in|decent or unbecoming behaviour. This, at any rate, is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give a full view of the &s;ubject; and who knows whe|ther it may not, over and above, open &s;ome track that will lead us to what we are in que&s;t of?</P>
<P>A gro&s;s impropriety is puni&s;hed with con|tempt and indignation, which are vented a|gain&s;t the offender by every external ex|pre&s;&s;ion that can gratify the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. And even the &s;lighte&s;t impropriety rai&s;es &s;ome degree of contempt. But there are improprieties, generally of the &s;lighter kind, that provoke laughter; of which we have examples without end in the blunders and ab&s;urdities of our own &s;pecies. Such
<PB N="16" REF="15">
improprieties receive a different puni&s;h|ment, as will appear by what follows. The emotions of contempt and of laughter occa&s;ioned by an impropriety of this kind, uniting intimately in the mind of the &s;pec|tator, are expre&s;&s;ed externally by a peculiar &s;ort of laugh, termed <HI>a laugh of deri&s;ion</HI> or <HI>&s;corn</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 7.</NOTE>. An impropriety that thus moves not only contempt but laughter, is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the epithet of <HI>ridiculous</HI>; and a laugh of deri&s;ion or &s;corn is the puni&s;hment provided for it by nature. Nor ought it to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that we are &s;o fond of inflicting this puni&s;hment, as &s;ometimes to exert it even again&s;t creatures of an in|ferior &s;pecies; witne&s;s a Turkycock &s;well|ing with pride, and &s;trutting with di&s;played feathers. This object appears ridiculous, and in a gay mood is apt to provoke a laugh of deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not expect that the improprie|ties to which the&s;e different puni&s;hments are adapted, can be &s;eparated by any preci&s;e boundaries. Of improprieties, from the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
&s;lighte&s;t to the mo&s;t gro&s;s, from the mo&s;t ri&s;ible to the mo&s;t &s;erious, a &s;cale may be formed a&s;cending by degrees almo&s;t imper|ceptible. Hence it is, that in viewing &s;ome unbecoming actions, too ri&s;ible for anger and too &s;erious for deri&s;ion, the &s;pectator feels a &s;ort of mixt emotion partaking both of deri|&s;ion and of anger. This accounts for an expre&s;&s;ion, common with re&s;pect to the im|propriety of &s;ome actions, That we know not whether to laugh or be angry.</P>
<P>It cannot fail to be ob&s;erved, that in the ca&s;e of a ri&s;ible impropriety, which is al|ways &s;light, the contempt we have for the offender is extremely faint, though deri&s;ion, its gratification, is extremely plea&s;ant. This di&s;proportion betwixt a pa&s;&s;ion and its grati|fication, &s;eems not conformable to the ana|logy of nature. In looking about for a &s;o|lution, I reflect upon what is laid down a|bove, that an improper action, not only moves our contempt for the author, but al|&s;o, by means of contra&s;t, &s;wells the good o|pinion we have of our&s;elves. This contri|butes, more than any other article, to the plea&s;ure we feel in ridiculing the follies and
<PB N="18" REF="17">
ab&s;urdities of others. And accordingly, it is well known, that they who put the great|e&s;t value upon them&s;elves, are the mo&s;t prone to laugh at others. Pride is a vivid pa&s;&s;ion, as all are which have &s;elf for their object. It is extremely plea&s;ant in it&s;elf, and not le&s;s &s;o in its gratification. This pa&s;&s;ion &s;ingly would be &s;ufficient to account for the plea&s;ure of ridicule, without borrowing any aid from contempt. Hence appears the rea&s;on of a noted ob&s;ervation, That we are the mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to ridicule the blunders and ab&s;urdities of others, when we are in high &s;pirits; for in high &s;pirits, &s;elf-conceit di&s;plays it&s;elf with more than ordinary vi|gor.</P>
<P>Having with wary &s;teps traced an intri|cate road, not without danger of wander|ing; what remains to complete our jour|ney, is to account for the final cau&s;e of con|gruity and propriety, which make &s;o great a figure in the human con&s;titution. One fi|nal cau&s;e, regarding congruity, is pretty obvious. The &s;en&s;e of congruity, as one of the principles of the fine arts, contributes in a remarkable degree to our entertainment.
<PB N="19" REF="18">
This is the final cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned above for our &s;en&s;e of proportion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 3.</NOTE>, and need not be enlarged upon here. Congruity indeed with re&s;pect to quantity, coincides with proportion. When the parts of a building are nicely adju&s;ted to each other, it may be &s;aid indifferently, that it is agreeable by the congruity of its parts, or by the proportion of its parts. But propriety, which regards voluntary agents only, can never in any in|&s;tance be the &s;ame with proportion. A very long no&s;e is di&s;proportioned, but cannot be termed <HI>improper.</HI> In &s;ome in&s;tances, it is true, impropriety coincides with di&s;propor|tion in the &s;ame &s;ubject, but never in the &s;ame re&s;pect. I give for an example a very little man buckled to a long toledo. Con|&s;idering the man and the &s;word with re|&s;pect to &s;ize, we perceive a di&s;proportion. Con&s;idering the &s;word as the choice of the man, we perceive an impropriety.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of impropriety with re&s;pect to mi&s;takes, blunders, and ab&s;urdities, is hap|pily contrived for the good of mankind.
<PB N="20" REF="19">
In the &s;pectators it is productive of mirth and laughter, excellent recreation in an in|terval from bu&s;ine&s;s. The benefit is &s;till more exten&s;ive. It is not agreeable to be the &s;ubject of ridicule; and to puni&s;h with ridicule the man who is guilty of an ab&s;ur|dity, tends to put him more upon his guard in time coming. Thus even the mo&s;t in|nocent blunder is not committed with im|punity; becau&s;e, were errors licen&s;ed where they do no hurt, inattention would grow into a habit, and be the occa&s;ion of much hurt.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of propriety as to moral duties, is of all the mo&s;t illu&s;trious. To have a ju&s;t notion of it, the two &s;orts of moral duties mu&s;t be kept in view, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e that re&s;pect others, and tho&s;e that re|&s;pect our&s;elves. Fidelity, gratitude, and the forbearing injury, are examples of the fir&s;t &s;ort; temperance, mode&s;ty, firmne&s;s of mind, are examples of the other. The for|mer are made duties by means of the moral &s;en&s;e; the latter, by means of the &s;en&s;e of propriety. Here is a final cau&s;e of the &s;en&s;e of propriety, that mu&s;t rou&s;e our attention.
<PB N="21" REF="20">
It is undoubtedly the intere&s;t of every man, to regulate his behaviour &s;uitably to the dig|nity of his nature, and to the &s;tation allot|ted him by Providence. Such rational con|duct contributes in every re&s;pect to happi|ne&s;s: it contributes to health and plenty: it gains the e&s;teem of others: and, which is of all the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, it gains a ju&s;t|ly-founded &s;elf-e&s;teem. But in a matter &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our well-being, even &s;elf-intere&s;t is not relied on. The &s;en&s;e of propriety &s;u|peradds the powerful authority of duty to the motive of intere&s;t. The God of nature, in all things e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s, hath ob&s;erved one uniform method. To keep us &s;teady in our conduct, he hath fortified us with natural principles and feelings. The&s;e prevent many aberrations, which would daily happen were we totally &s;urren|dered to &s;o fallible a guide as is human rea|&s;on. The &s;en&s;e of propriety cannot ju&s;tly be con&s;idered in another light, than as the natural law that regulates our conduct with re&s;pect to our&s;elves; as the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice is the natural law that regulates our conduct with re&s;pect to others. I call the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="22" REF="21">
propriety a law, becau&s;e it really is &s;o, not le&s;s than the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. If by law be meant a rule of conduct that we are con|&s;cious ought to be obeyed, this definition, which I conceive to be &s;trictly accurate, is applicable undoubtedly to both. The &s;en&s;e of propriety includes this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; for to &s;ay an action is proper, is, in other words, to &s;ay, that it <HI>ought</HI> to be performed; and to &s;ay it is improper, is, in other words, to &s;ay, that it <HI>ought</HI> to be forborn. It is this very con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>ought</HI> and <HI>&s;hould</HI> inclu|ded in the moral &s;en&s;e, that makes ju&s;tice a law to us. This con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duty, when applied to propriety, is perhaps not &s;o vigo|rous or &s;trong as when applied to ju&s;tice: but the difference is in degree only, not in kind: and we ought, without he&s;itation or reluctance, to &s;ubmit equally to the govern|ment of both.</P>
<P>But I have more to urge upon this head. It mu&s;t, in the next place, be ob&s;erved, that to the &s;en&s;e of propriety as well as of ju&s;tice are annexed the &s;anctions of rewards and puni&s;hments; which evidently prove the one to be a law as well as the other. The
<PB N="23" REF="22">
&s;atisfaction a man hath in doing his duty, joined with the e&s;teem and good-will of o|thers, is the reward that belongs to both e|qually. The puni&s;hments al&s;o, though not the &s;ame, are nearly allied; and differ in degree more than in quality. Di&s;obedience to the law of ju&s;tice, is puni&s;hed with re|mor&s;e; di&s;obedience to the law of propriety, with &s;hame, which is remor&s;e in a lower de|gree. Every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of ju|&s;tice rai&s;es indignation in the beholder; and &s;o doth every flagrant tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of propriety. Slighter improprieties re|ceive a milder puni&s;hment: they are always rebuked with &s;ome degree of contempt, and frequently with deri&s;ion. In general, it is true, that the rewards and puni&s;hments an|nexed to the &s;en&s;e of propriety are &s;lighter in degree than tho&s;e annexed to the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. And that this is wi&s;ely ordered, will appear from con&s;idering, that to the well-being of &s;ociety, duty to others is &s;till more e&s;&s;ential than duty to our&s;elves; for &s;ociety could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment, were in|dividuals not protected from the head&s;trong and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions of their neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Reflecting coolly and carefully upon the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, the con&s;titution of man, admirable in all its parts, appears here in a fine light. The final cau&s;e now unfolded of the &s;en&s;e of propriety, mu&s;t, to every di&s;cerning eye, appear delightful; and yet hitherto we have given but a partial view of it. The &s;en&s;e of propriety reaches another illu&s;trious end; which is, to co|ope|rate with the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice in inforcing the performance of &s;ocial duties. In fact, the &s;anctions vi&s;ibly contrived to compel a man to be ju&s;t to him&s;elf, are equally &s;er|viceable to compel him to be ju&s;t to others. This will be evident from a &s;ingle reflection, That an action, by being unju&s;t, cea&s;es not to be improper. An action never appears more eminently improper, than when it is unju&s;t. It is obviou&s;ly becoming and &s;uit|able to human nature, that each man do his duty to others; and accordingly every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of duty with re&s;pect to others, is at the &s;ame time a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of duty with re&s;pect to &s;elf. This is an undi&s;gui&s;ed truth without exaggeration; and it opens a new and delightful view in the moral land|&s;cape.
<PB N="25" REF="24">
The pro&s;pect is greatly enriched, by the multiplication of agreeable objects. It appears now, that nothing is overlooked, nothing left undone, that can po&s;&s;ibly con|tribute to the enforcing &s;ocial duty. For to all the &s;anctions that belong to it &s;ingly, are &s;uperadded the &s;anctions of &s;elf-duty. A fa|miliar example &s;hall &s;uffice for illu&s;tration. An act of ingratitude con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is to the author di&s;agreeable as well as to eve|ry &s;pectator: con&s;idered by the author with relation to him&s;elf, it rai&s;es &s;elf-contempt: con&s;idered by him with relation to the world, it makes him a&s;hamed. Again, con&s;idered by others, it rai&s;es their con|tempt and indignation again&s;t the author. The&s;e feelings are all of them occa&s;ioned by the impropriety of the action. When the action is con&s;idered as unju&s;t, it occa&s;ions another &s;et of feelings. In the author it produces remor&s;e, and a dread of me|rited puni&s;hment; and in others, the bene|factor chiefly, indignation and hatred di|rected upon the ungrateful per&s;on. Thus &s;hame and remor&s;e united in the ungrateful
<PB N="26" REF="25">
per&s;on, and indignation united with hatred in the hearts of others, are the puni&s;hments provided by nature for inju&s;tice. Stupid and in&s;en&s;ible mu&s;t he be in extreme, who, in a contrivance &s;o exqui&s;ite, perceives not the hand of the Sovereign Architect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Dignity and Meanne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THESE terms are applied to man in point of character, &s;entiment, and behaviour. We &s;ay, for example, of one man, that he hath a natural dignity in his air and manner; of another, that he makes a mean figure. There is a dignity in every action and &s;entiment of &s;ome per|&s;ons: the actions and &s;entiments of others are mean and vulgar. With re&s;pect to the fine arts, &s;ome performances are &s;aid to be manly and &s;uitable to the dignity of human nature: others are termed low, mean, trivial. Such expre&s;&s;ions are common, though they have not always a preci&s;e mean|ing. With re&s;pect to the art of critici&s;m, it mu&s;t be a real acqui&s;ition to a&s;certain what the&s;e terms truly import; which po&s;|&s;ibly may enable us to rank every perform|ance in the fine arts according to its dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
Inquiring fir&s;t to what &s;ubjects the terms <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> are appropriated, we &s;oon di&s;cover, that they are not applicable to any thing inanimate. The mo&s;t magni|ficent palace ever built, may be lofty, may be grand, but it has no relation to dignity. The mo&s;t diminutive &s;hrub may be little, but it is not mean. The&s;e terms mu&s;t be|long to &s;en&s;itive beings, probably to man only; which will be evident when we ad|vance in the inquiry.</P>
<P>Of all objects, human actions produce in a &s;pectator the greate&s;t variety of feelings. They are in them&s;elves grand or little: with re&s;pect to the author, they are proper or improper: with re&s;pect to tho&s;e affected by them, ju&s;t or unju&s;t. And I mu&s;t now add, that they are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by dignity and meanne&s;s. It may po&s;&s;ibly be thought, that with re&s;pect to human ac|tions, dignity coincides with grandeur, and meanne&s;s with littlene&s;s. But the differ|ence will be evident upon reflecting, that we never attribute dignity to any action but what is virtuous, nor meanne&s;s to any but what in &s;ome degree is faulty. But an ac|tion
<PB N="29" REF="28">
may be grand without being virtuous, or little without being faulty. Every action of dignity creates re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the author; and a mean action draws upon him contempt. A man is always admired for a grand action, but frequently is neither loved nor e&s;teemed for it: neither is a man always contemned for a low or little action.</P>
<P>As it appears to me, dignity and mean|ne&s;s are founded on a natural principle not hitherto mentioned. Man is endued with a &s;en&s;e of the worth and excellence of his nature. He deems it to be more perfect than that of the other beings around him; and he feels that the perfection of his na|ture con&s;i&s;ts in virtue, particularly in virtue of the highe&s;t rank. To expre&s;s this &s;en&s;e, the term <HI>dignity</HI> is appropriated. Further, to behave with dignity, and to refrain from all mean actions, is felt to be, not a virtue only, but a duty: it is a duty every man owes to him&s;elf. By acting in this manner, he attracts love and e&s;teem. By acting meanly or below him&s;elf, he is di&s;approved and contemned.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
According to the de&s;cription here given of dignity and meanne&s;s, they will be found to be a &s;pecies of propriety and impropriety. Many actions may be proper or improper, to which dignity or meanne&s;s cannot be applied. To eat when one is hungry is proper, but there is no dignity in this ac|tion. Revenge fairly taken, if again&s;t law, is improper, but it is not mean. But every action of dignity is al&s;o proper, and every mean action is al&s;o improper.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of the dignity of human na|ture, reaches even our plea&s;ures and amu&s;e|ments. If they enlarge the mind by rai&s;ing grand or elevated emotions, or if they hu|manize the mind by exerci&s;ing our &s;ympa|thy, they are approved as &s;uited to our na|ture: if they contract the mind by fixing it on trivial objects, they are contemned as low and mean. Hence in general, every occupation, whether of u&s;e or amu&s;ement, that corre&s;ponds to the dignity of man, ob|tains the epithet of <HI>manly</HI>; and every occu|pation below his nature, obtains the epithet of <HI>childi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>To tho&s;e who &s;tudy human nature, there
<PB N="31" REF="30">
is a point which has always appeared intri|cate. How comes it that genero&s;ity and courage are more valued and be&s;tow more dignity, than good-nature, or even ju&s;tice, though the latter contribute more than the former, to private as well as to public hap|pine&s;s? This que&s;tion bluntly propo&s;ed, might puzzle a cunning philo&s;opher; but by means of the foregoing ob&s;ervations will ea&s;ily be &s;olved. Human virtues, like o|ther objects, obtain a rank in our e&s;tima|tion, not from their utility, which is a &s;ub|ject of reflection, but from the direct im|pre&s;&s;ion they make on us. Ju&s;tice and good-nature are a &s;ort of negative virtues, that make no figure unle&s;s when they are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. Courage and genero&s;ity pro|ducing elevated emotions, enliven greatly the &s;en&s;e of a man's dignity, both in him|&s;elf and in others; and for that rea&s;on, cou|rage and genero&s;ity are in higher regard than the other virtues mentioned. We de|&s;cribe them as grand and elevated, as of greater dignity, and more prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>This leads us to examine more directly emotions and pa&s;&s;ions with re&s;pect to the
<PB N="32" REF="31">
pre&s;ent &s;ubject. And it will not be diffi|cult to form a &s;cale of them, beginning at the meane&s;t, and a&s;cending gradually to tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank and dignity. Plea&s;ure felt as at the organ of &s;en&s;e, named <HI>corporeal plea&s;ure,</HI> is perceived to be low; and when indulged to exce&s;s, beyond what nature demands, is perceived al&s;o to be mean. Per&s;ons therefore of any delicacy, di&s;&s;emble the plea&s;ure they have in eating and drinking. The plea&s;ures of the eye and ear, which have no organic feeling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Introduction.</NOTE>, are free from any &s;en&s;e of meanne&s;s; and for that rea&s;on are indulged without any &s;hame. They even ari&s;e to a certain degree of dignity, when their objects are grand or elevated. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e of the &s;ym|pathetic pa&s;&s;ions. They rai&s;e the character con&s;iderably, when their objects are of im|portance. A virtuous per&s;on behaving with fortitude and dignity under the mo&s;t cruel misfortunes, makes a capital figure; and the &s;ympathi&s;ing &s;pectator feels in him&s;elf the &s;ame dignity. Sympathetic di&s;tre&s;s at
<PB N="33" REF="32">
the &s;ame time never is mean: on the con|trary, it is agreeable to the nature of a &s;ocial being, and has the general approbation. The rank that love po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in this &s;cale, depends in a great mea&s;ure on its object. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a low place when founded on external properties merely; and is mean when be&s;towed upon a per&s;on of a rank much inferior without any extraordinary qualification. But when founded on the more elevated internal properties, it a&s;&s;umes a con&s;iderable degree of dignity. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e of friend&s;hip. When gra|titude is warm, it animates the mind; but it &s;carce ri&s;es to dignity. Joy be&s;tows dig|nity when it proceeds from an elevated cau&s;e.</P>
<P>So far as I can gather from induction, dignity is not a property of any di&s;agreea|ble pa&s;&s;ion. One is &s;light another &s;evere, one depre&s;&s;es the mind another rou&s;es and animates it; but there is no elevation, far le&s;s dignity, in any of them. Revenge, in particular, though it inflame and &s;well the mind, is not accompanied with dignity, not even with elevation. It is not however felt
<PB N="34" REF="33">
as mean or groveling, unle&s;s when it takes indirect mea&s;ures for its gratification. Shame and remor&s;e, though they &s;ink the &s;pirits, are not mean. Pride, a di&s;agreeable pa&s;|&s;ion, be&s;tows no dignity in the eye of a &s;pectator. Vanity always appears mean; and extremely &s;o where founded, as com|monly happens, on trivial qualifications.</P>
<P>I proceed to the plea&s;ures of the under|&s;tanding, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a high rank in point of dignity. Of this every one will be &s;en|&s;ible, when he con&s;iders the important truths that have been laid open by &s;cience; &s;uch as general theorems, and the general laws that govern the material and moral worlds. The plea&s;ures of the under&s;tanding are &s;uit|ed to man as a rational and contemplative being; and they tend not a little to ennoble his nature. Even to the Deity he &s;tretches his contemplations, which, in the di&s;covery of infinite power wi&s;dom and benevolence, afford delight of the mo&s;t exalted kind. Hence it appears, that the fine arts &s;tudied as a rational &s;cience, afford entertainment of great dignity; &s;uperior far to what they afford as a &s;ubject of ta&s;te merely.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
But contemplation, though in it&s;elf va|luable, is chiefly re&s;pected as &s;ub&s;ervient to action; for man is intended to be more an active than a contemplative being. He accordingly &s;hows more dignity in action than in contemplation. Genero&s;ity, mag|nanimity, heroi&s;m, rai&s;e his character to the highe&s;t pitch. The&s;e be&s;t expre&s;s the dignity of his nature, and advance him nearer to divinity than any other of his at|tributes.</P>
<P>By every production that &s;hows art and contrivance, our curio&s;ity is excited upon two points; fir&s;t how it was made, and next to what end. Of the two, the latter is the more important inquiry, becau&s;e the means are ever &s;ubordinate to the end; and in fact our curio&s;ity is always more in|flamed by the final than by the efficient cau&s;e. This preference is no where more vi&s;ible, than in contemplating the works of nature. If in the efficient cau&s;e, wi&s;|dom and power be di&s;played, wi&s;dom is not le&s;s con&s;picuous in the final cau&s;e; and from it only can we infer benevolence, which of all the divine attributes is to man the mo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="35">
important. Having endeavoured to a&s;&s;ign the efficient cau&s;e of dignity and meanne&s;s, and to unfold the principle on which they are founded, we proceed to explain the final cau&s;e of the dignity or meanne&s;s be&s;towed upon the &s;everal particulars above mention|ed, beginning with corporeal plea&s;ures. The&s;e, &s;o far as u&s;eful, are like ju&s;tice fenced with &s;ufficient &s;anctions to prevent their being neglected. Hunger and thir&s;t are painful &s;en&s;ations; and we are incited to animal love by a vigorous propen&s;ity. Were they dignified over and above with a place in a high cla&s;s, they would infallibly overturn the balance of the mind, by out|weighing the &s;ocial affections. This is a &s;atisfactory final cau&s;e for refu&s;ing to corpo|real plea&s;ures any degree of dignity. And the final cau&s;e is not le&s;s evident of their meanne&s;s, when they are indulged to ex|ce&s;s. The more refined plea&s;ures of exter|nal &s;en&s;e, conveyed by the eye and the ear from natural objects and from the fine arts, de&s;erve a high place in our e&s;teem, becau&s;e of their &s;ingular and exten&s;ive utility. In &s;ome ca&s;es they ari&s;e to a con&s;iderable dig|nity.
<PB N="37" REF="36">
The very lowe&s;t plea&s;ures of the kind, are never e&s;teemed mean or grovel|ing. The plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from wit, hu|mour, ridicule, or from what is &s;imply lu|dicrous, is u&s;eful, by relaxing the mind after the fatigue of more manly occupation. But the mind, when it &s;urrenders it&s;elf to plea&s;ure of this kind, lo&s;es its vigor, and &s;inks gradually into &s;loth. The place this plea&s;ure occupies in point of dignity, is ad|ju&s;ted to the&s;e views. To make it u&s;eful as a relaxation, it is not branded with meanne&s;s. To prevent its u&s;urpation, it is removed from this place but a &s;ingle de|gree. No man values him&s;elf upon this plea&s;ure, even during the gratification; and if more time have been given to it than is requi&s;ite for relaxation, a man looks back with &s;ome degree of &s;hame.</P>
<P>In point of dignity, the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e above the &s;elfi&s;h, and much above the plea|&s;ures of the eye and ear. Man is by his na|ture a &s;ocial being; and to qualify him for &s;ociety, it is wi&s;ely contrived, that he &s;hould value him&s;elf more for being &s;ocial than &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
The excellency of man is chiefly di&s;cern|ible in the great improvements he is &s;u&s;cep|tible of in &s;ociety. The&s;e, by per&s;everance, may be carried on progre&s;&s;ively to higher and higher degrees of perfection, above any a&s;&s;ignable limits; and, even ab&s;tracting from revelation, there is great probability, that the progre&s;s begun in this life will be completed in &s;ome future &s;tate. Now, as all valuable improvements proceed from the exerci&s;e of our rational faculties, the author of our nature, in order to excite us to a due u&s;e of the&s;e faculties, hath a&s;&s;igned a high rank to the plea&s;ures of the under&s;tanding. Their utility, with re&s;pect to this life as well as a future, intitles them to this rank.</P>
<P>But as action is the end of all our im|provements, virtuous actions ju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t of all the ranks. The&s;e, I find, are by nature di&s;tributed into different cla&s;&s;|es, and the fir&s;t in point of dignity a&s;&s;igned to actions which appear not the fir&s;t in point of u&s;e. Genero&s;ity, for example, in the &s;en&s;e of mankind, is more re&s;pected than ju&s;tice, though the latter is undoubtedly more e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety. And magnanimi|ty,

heroi&s;m, undaunted courage, ri&s;e &s;till higher in our e&s;teem. One would readily think, that the moral virtues &s;hould be e|&s;teemed according to their importance. Nature has here deviated from her ordinary path, and great wi&s;dom is &s;hown in the de|viation. The efficient cau&s;e is explained above; and the final cau&s;e is explained in the E&s;&s;ays of morality and natural reli|gion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. e&s;&s;ay 2. chap. 4.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="41" REF="40">
Having therefore happily unravelled the ab&s;tru&s;e and knotty part, I proceed to what may be thought further nece&s;&s;ary upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Burle&s;que is one great engine of ridicule. But it is not confined to that &s;ubject; for it is clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable into burle&s;que that excites laughter merely, and burle&s;que that provokes deri&s;ion or ridicule. A grave &s;ubject in which there is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain colouring &s;o as to be ri&s;ible. This is the ca&s;e of <HI>Vir|gil Trave&s;tie</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scarron.</NOTE>. And it is the ca&s;e of the <HI>Secchia Rapita</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ta&s;&s;oni.</NOTE>. The authors laugh fir&s;t at every turn, in order to make their readers laugh. The <HI>Lutrin</HI> is a burle&s;que poem of the other &s;ort. The author Boileau, lays hold of a low and trifling incident to ex|po&s;e the luxury, indolence, and contentious &s;pirit of a &s;et of monks. He turns the &s;ub|ject into ridicule by dre&s;&s;ing it in the heroic &s;tyle, and affecting to con&s;ider it as of the utmo&s;t dignity and importance; and though ridicule is the poet's aim, he him&s;elf carries
<PB N="42" REF="41">
all along a grave face, and never once be|wrays a &s;mile. The oppo&s;ition betwixt the &s;ubject and the manner of handling it, is what produces the ridicule. In a compo&s;i|tion of this kind, no image profe&s;&s;edly ludi|crous ought to have quarter; becau&s;e &s;uch images de&s;troy the contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Though the burle&s;que that aims at ridi|cule, produces its effect by elevating the &s;tyle far above the &s;ubject, yet it has limits beyond which the elevation ought not to be carried. The poet, con&s;ulting the imagi|nation of his readers, ought to confine him|&s;elf to &s;uch images as are lively and readily apprehended. A &s;trained elevation, &s;oaring above an ordinary reach of fancy, makes not a plea&s;ant impre&s;&s;ion. The mind fatigued with being always upon the &s;tretch, is &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted; and if it per&s;everes, becomes thoughtle&s;s and indifferent. Further, a fic|tion gives no plea&s;ure, unle&s;s where painted in &s;o lively colours as to produce &s;ome per|ception of reality; which never can be done effectually where the images are formed with labour or difficulty. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I cannot avoid condemning the <HI>Batrachomuo|machia</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42">
&s;aid to be the compo&s;ition of Homer. It is beyond the power of imagination, to form a clear and lively image of frogs and mice acting with the dignity of the highe&s;t of our &s;pecies: nor can we form a concep|tion of the reality of &s;uch an action, in any manner &s;o di&s;tinct as to intere&s;t our affections even in the &s;lighte&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is of a character clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e now men|tioned. It is not properly a burle&s;que per|formance, but what may rather be termed <HI>an heroi-comical poem.</HI> It treats a gay and familiar &s;ubject, with plea&s;antry and with a moderate degree of dignity. The author puts not on a ma&s;k like Boileau, nor pro|fe&s;&s;es to make us laugh like Ta&s;&s;oni. The <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is a genteel and gay &s;pecies of writing, le&s;s &s;trained than the others mentioned; and is plea&s;ant or ludicrous without having ridicule for its chief aim; giving way however to ridicule where it ari|&s;es naturally from a particular character, &s;uch as that of Sir Plume. Addi&s;on's <HI>Spec|tator</HI> upon the exerci&s;e of the fan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N^o 102.</NOTE> is ex|tremely
<PB N="44" REF="43">
gay and ludicrous, re&s;embling in its &s;ubject the <HI>Rape of the Lock.</HI></P>
<P>Humour belongs to the pre&s;ent chapter, becau&s;e it is undoubtedly connected with ridi|cule. Congreve defines humour to be <Q REND="inline">"a &s;in|gular and unavoidable manner of doing or &s;aying any thing, peculiar and natural to one man only, by which his &s;peech and ac|tions are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of other men."</Q> Were this definition ju&s;t, a ma|je&s;tic and commanding air, which is a &s;in|gular property, is humour; as al&s;o that na|tural flow of eloquence and correct elocu|tion which is a rare talent. Nothing ju&s;t or proper is denominated humour; nor any &s;ingularity of character, words, or actions, that is valued or re&s;pected. When we at|tend to the character of an humori&s;t, we find that the peculiarity of this character le&s;&s;ens the man in our e&s;teem: we find that this character ari&s;es from circum&s;tances both ri&s;ible and improper, and therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure ridiculous.</P>
<P>Humour in writing is very different from humour in character. When an author in|&s;i&s;ts upon ludicrous &s;ubjects with a profe&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="54" REF="44">
purpo&s;e to make his readers laugh, he may be &s;tyled <HI>a ludicrous writer</HI>; but is &s;carce intitled to be &s;tyled <HI>a writer of hu|mour.</HI> This quality belongs to an author, who, affecting to be grave and &s;erious, paints his objects in &s;uch colours as to pro|voke mirth and laughter. A writer that is really an humori&s;t in character, does this without de&s;ign. If not, he mu&s;t affect the character in order to &s;ucceed. Swift and Fontaine were humori&s;ts in character, and their writings are full of humour. Addi&s;on was not an humori&s;t in character; and yet in his pro&s;e writings a mo&s;t delicate and re|fined humour prevails. Arbuthnot exceeds them all in drollery and humorous painting; which &s;hows a great genius, becau&s;e, if I am not mi&s;informed, he had nothing of this peculiarity in his character.</P>
<P>There remains to &s;how, by examples, the manner of treating &s;ubjects &s;o as to give them a ridiculous appearance.<Q><SP>

<P>Irony turns things into ridicule in a pe|culiar manner. It con&s;i&s;ts in laughing at a man under di&s;gui&s;e, by appearing to prai&s;e or &s;peak well of him. Swift affords us ma|ny illu&s;trious examples of this &s;pecies of ri|dicule. Take the following example. <Q REND="inline">"By the&s;e methods, in a few weeks, there &s;tarts up many a writer, capable of managing the profounde&s;t and mo&s;t

And if you will bate him but the circum&s;tances of method, and &s;tyle, and grammar, and invention; allow him but the common privileges of tran&s;cribing from others, and digre&s;&s;ing from him&s;elf, as often as he &s;hall &s;ee oc|ca&s;ion; he will de&s;ire no more ingre|dients towards fitting up a treati&s;e that &s;hall make a very comely figure on a book&s;eller's &s;helf, there to be pre&s;erved neat and clean, for a long eternity, ad|orned with the heraldry of its title, fairly in&s;cribed on a label; never to be thumbed or grea&s;ed by &s;tudents, nor bound to e|verla&s;ting chains of darkne&s;s in a libra|ry; but when the fullne&s;s of time is come, &s;hall happily undergo the trial of purgatory, in order to a&s;cend the &s;ky<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tale of a Tub, &s;ect. 7.</NOTE>."</Q> The following pa&s;&s;age from Arbuthnot is not le&s;s ironical. <Q REND="inline">"If the Reverend clergy &s;howed more concern than others, I charitably impute it to their great charge of &s;ouls; and what confirmed me in this

<P>A parody mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from every &s;pecies of ridicule. It enlivens a gay &s;ubject by imitating &s;ome important inci|dent that is &s;erious. It is ludicrous, and may be ri&s;ible.

<P>The interpo&s;ition of the gods in the man|ner of Homer and Virgil, ought to be confined to ludicrous &s;ubjects, which are much enlivened by &s;uch interpo&s;ition han|dled in the form of a parody; witne&s;s the cave of Spleen, <HI>Rape of the Lock, canto</HI> 4.; the godde&s;s of Di&s;cord; <HI>Lutrin, canto</HI> 1.; and the godde&s;s of Indolence, <HI>canto</HI> 2.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have a talent for ridicule, which is &s;eldom united with a ta&s;te for de|licate and refined beauties, are quick-&s;ight|ed in improprieties; and the&s;e they eagerly
<PB N="55" REF="54">
lay hold of, in order to gratify their favou|rite propen&s;ity. The per&s;ons galled have no other refuge but to maintain, that ridi|cule ought not to be applied to grave &s;ub|jects. It is yielded, on the other hand, that &s;ubjects really grave and important, are by no means fit for ridicule: but then it is urged, that ridicule is the only proper te&s;t for di&s;covering whether a &s;ubject be really grave, or be made &s;o artificially by cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion. This di&s;pute has pro|duced a celebrated que&s;tion, Whether ridi|cule be or be not a te&s;t of truth? I give this que&s;tion a place here, becau&s;e it tends to illu&s;trate the nature of ridicule.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion &s;tated in accurate terms is, Whether the &s;en&s;e of ridicule be the proper te&s;t for di&s;tingui&s;hing ridiculous objects from tho&s;e that are not &s;o? To an&s;wer this que|&s;tion with preci&s;ion, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that ridicule is not a &s;ubject of rea&s;oning, but of &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 10. compared with chap. 7.</NOTE>. This being taken for grant|ed, I proceed thus. No per&s;on doubts that our &s;en&s;e of beauty is the true te&s;t of what
<PB N="56" REF="55">
is beautiful, and our &s;en&s;e of grandeur, of what is great or &s;ublime. Is it more doubt|ful whether our &s;en&s;e of ridicule be the true te&s;t of what is ridiculous? It is not only the true te&s;t, but indeed the only te&s;t. For this is a &s;ubject that comes not, more than beauty or grandeur, under the province of rea&s;on. If any &s;ubject, by the influence of fa&s;hion or cu&s;tom, have acquired a degree of veneration or e&s;teem to which naturally it is not intitled, what are the proper means for wiping off the artificial colouring, and di&s;playing the &s;ubject in its true light? Rea&s;oning, as ob&s;erved, cannot be applied. And therefore the only means is to judge by ta&s;te. The te&s;t of ridicule which &s;eparates it from its artificial connections, expo&s;es it naked with all its native improprieties.</P>
<P>But it is urged, that the grave&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious matters may be &s;et in a ridiculous light. Hardly &s;o; for where an object is neither ri&s;ible nor improper, it lies not open in any quarter to an attack from ridicule. But &s;uppo&s;ing the fact, I fore&s;ee not any harmful con&s;equence. By the &s;ame &s;ort of rea&s;oning, a talent for wit ought to be con|demned, becau&s;e it may be employed to
<PB N="57" REF="56">
burle&s;que a great or lofty &s;ubject. Such ir|regular u&s;e made of a talent for wit or ridi|cule, cannot long impo&s;e upon mankind. It cannot &s;tand the te&s;t of correct and deli|cate ta&s;te; and truth will at la&s;t prevail even with the vulgar. To condemn a talent for ridicule becau&s;e it may be perverted to wrong purpo&s;es, is not a little ridicu|lous. Could one forbear to &s;mile, if a talent for rea&s;oning were condemned be|cau&s;e it al&s;o may be perverted? And yet the conclu&s;ion in the latter ca&s;e, would be not le&s;s ju&s;t than in the former; per|haps more ju&s;t, for no talent is &s;o often perverted as that of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>We had be&s;t leave Nature to her own o|perations. The mo&s;t valuable talents may be abu&s;ed, and &s;o may that of ridicule. Let us bring it under proper culture if we can, without endeavouring to pull it up by the root. Were we de&s;titute of this te&s;t of truth, I know not what might be the con&s;equen|ces: I &s;ee not what rule would be left us to prevent &s;plendid trifles pa&s;&s;ing for matters of importance, &s;how and form for &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;uper&s;tition or enthu&s;ia&s;m for pure reli|gion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. WIT.</HEAD>
<P>WIT is a quality of certain thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions. The term is never applied to an action or a pa&s;&s;ion, and as little to an external object.</P>
<P>However difficult it may be in every par|ticular in&s;tance to di&s;tingui&s;h a witty thought or expre&s;&s;ion from one that is not &s;o, yet in general it may be laid down, that the term <HI>wit</HI> is appropriated to &s;uch thoughts and ex|pre&s;&s;ions as are ludicrous, and al&s;o occa&s;ion &s;ome degree of &s;urpri&s;e by their &s;ingularity. Wit al&s;o in a figurative &s;en&s;e expre&s;&s;es that talent which &s;ome men have of inventing ludicrous thoughts or expre&s;&s;ions. We &s;ay commonly, <HI>a witty man,</HI> or <HI>a man of wit.</HI></P>
<P>Wit in its proper &s;en&s;e, as &s;ugge&s;ted a|bove, is di&s;tingui&s;hable into two kinds; wit in the thought, and wit in the words or ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Again, wit in the thought is of
<PB N="59" REF="58">
two kinds; ludicrous images, and ludicrous combinations of things that have little or no natural relation.</P>
<P>Ludicrous images that occa&s;ion &s;urpri&s;e by their &s;ingularity, as having little or no foun|dation in nature, are fabricated by the ima|gination. And the imagination is well qua|lified for the office; being of all our facul|ties the mo&s;t active, and the lea&s;t under re|&s;traint. Take the following example.
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Shylock.</SPEAKER>
<P>You knew (none &s;o well, none &s;o well as you) of my daughter's flight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Salino.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings &s;he flew withal.</P>
</SP><BIBL>Merchant of Venice, act 3. &s;c. 1.</BIBL></Q>
The image here is undoubtedly witty. It is ludicrous: and it mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;urpri&s;e; for having no natural foundation, it is altoge|ther unexpected.</P>
<P>The other branch of wit in the thought, is that only which is taken notice of by Ad|di&s;on, following Locke, who defines it <Q REND="inline">"to lie in the a&s;&s;emblage of ideas; and put|ting tho&s;e together with quickne&s;s and variety, wherein can be found any re&s;em|blance
<PB N="60" REF="59">
or congruity, thereby to make up plea&s;ant pictures and agreeable vi&s;ions in the fancy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 2. ch. 11. &sect; 2.</NOTE>."</Q>  It may be defined more curtly, and perhaps more accurately, <Q REND="inline">"A junction of things by di&s;tant and fanciful relations, which &s;urpri&s;e becau&s;e they are unexpected<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> The following is a pro|per example.<Q><L>We grant although he had much wit,</L>
<L>H' was very &s;hie of u&s;ing it,</L>
<L>As being loth to wear it out;</L>
<L>And therefore bore it not about,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s on holidays, or &s;o,</L>
<L>As men their be&s;t apparel do.</L>
<BIBL>Hudibras, canto 1.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Wit is of all the mo&s;t elegant recreation. The image enters the mind with gaiety, and gives a &s;udden fla&s;h which is extremely plea|&s;ant. Wit thereby gently elevates with|out &s;training, rai&s;es mirth without di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s, and relaxes while it entertains.</P>
<P>Wit in the expre&s;&s;ion, commonly called <HI>a play of words,</HI> being a ba&s;tard &s;ort of wit,
<PB N="61" REF="60">
is re&s;erved for the la&s;t place. I proceed to examples of wit in the thought. And fir&s;t of ludicrous images.</P>

<P>I would you had but the wit; 'twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this &s;ame young &s;ober-blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine. There's never any of the&s;e demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth &s;o over-cool their blood, and making many fi&s;h-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green|&s;ickne&s;s; and then, when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards; which &s;ome of us &s;hould be too, but for inflamma|tion. A good &s;herris-&s;ack hath a twofold operation in it; it a&s;cends me into the brain; dries me there all the fooli&s;h, dull, and crudy vapours which en|viron it; makes it apprehen&s;ive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable &s;hapes; which deliver'd o'er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The &s;econd pro|perty of your excellent &s;herris, is, the warming of the blood; which before cold and &s;ettled, left the liver white and pale; which is the badge of pu|&s;illanimity
<PB N="64" REF="63">
and cowardice: but the &s;herris warms it, and makes it cour&s;e from the inwards, to the parts extreme; it illuminateth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the re&s;t of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital com|moners and inland petty &s;pirits mu&s;ter me all to their captain, the heart; who, great, and puff'd up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage: and this valour comes of &s;herris. So that &s;kill in the weapon is nothing without &s;ack, for that &s;ets it a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till &s;ack commences it, and &s;ets it in act and u&s;e. Hereof comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did natu|rally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, &s;teril, and bare land, manured, hu&s;banded, and till'd, with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good &s;tore of fertil &s;herris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thou&s;and &s;ons, the fir&s;t human principle I would teach them, &s;hould be to for&s;wear thin potations, and to addict them&s;elves to &s;ack.</P>

<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed wit in the thought, we proceed to what is verbal only, commonly called <HI>a play of words.</HI> This &s;ort of wit de|pends for the mo&s;t part upon chu&s;ing words that have different &s;ignifications. By this artifice, hocus-pocus tricks are played in language; and thoughts plain and &s;imple take on a very different appearance. Play is nece&s;&s;ary for man, in order to refre&s;h him after labour; and accordingly man loves play. He even reli&s;heth a play of
<PB N="72" REF="71">
words; and it is happy for us, that words can be employed, not only for u&s;eful pur|po&s;es, but al&s;o for our amu&s;ement. This amu&s;ement accordingly, though humble and low, is reli&s;hed by &s;ome at all times, and by all at &s;ome times, in order to un|bend the mind.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this low &s;pecies of wit, has, at one time or other, made a fi|gure in mo&s;t civilized nations, and has gra|dually gone into di&s;repute. So &s;oon as a language is formed into a &s;y&s;tem, and the meaning of words are a&s;certained with tole|rable accuracy, opportunity is afforded for expre&s;&s;ions, which, by the double meaning of &s;ome words, give a familiar thought the appearance of being new. And the pene|tration of the reader or hearer, is gratified in detecting the true &s;en&s;e di&s;gui&s;ed under the double meaning. That this &s;ort of wit was in England deemed a reputable amu&s;ement, during the reigns of Eli&s;abeth and James I. is vouched by the works of Shake&s;pear, and even by the writings of grave divines. But it cannot have any any long endurance: for as language ripens, and the meaning of
<PB N="73" REF="72">
words is more and more a&s;certained, words held to be &s;ynonymous dimini&s;h daily; and when tho&s;e that remain have been more than once employed, the plea&s;ure vani&s;heth with the novelty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Cu&s;tom and Habit.</HEAD>
<P>INquiring into the nature of man as a &s;en&s;itive being, and finding him af|fected in a high degree with novelty, would any one conjecture that he is equally affected with cu&s;tom? Yet the&s;e frequently take place, not only in the &s;ame per&s;on, but even with relation to the &s;ame &s;ubject: when new, it is inchanting; familiarity renders it indifferent; and cu&s;tom, after a longer familiarity, makes it again de&s;irable. Human nature, diver&s;ified with many and various &s;prings of action, is wonderfully, and, indulging the expre&s;&s;ion, intricately con&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom hath &s;uch influence upon many of our feelings, by warping and varying them, that we mu&s;t attend to its operations if we would be acquainted with human na|ture.
<PB N="82" REF="81">
This &s;ubject, in it&s;elf ob&s;cure, has been much neglected; and to give a com|plete analy&s;is of it will be no ea&s;y ta&s;k. I pretend only to touch it cur&s;orily; hoping, however, that what is here laid down, will di&s;po&s;e more diligent inquirers to attempt further di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> re&s;pects the action, <HI>habit</HI> the actor. By cu&s;tom we mean, a frequent re|iteration of the &s;ame act; and by habit, the effect that cu&s;tom has on the mind or body. This effect may be either active, witne&s;s the dexterity produced by cu&s;tom in performing certain exerci&s;es; or pa&s;&s;ive, as when, by cu|&s;tom, a peculiar connection is formed betwixt a man and &s;ome agreeable object, which ac|quires thereby a greater power to rai&s;e emo|tions in him than it hath naturally. Active habits come not under the pre&s;ent underta|king; and therefore I confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e that are pa&s;&s;ive.</P>

Again, though cu&s;tom blunts the edge of di&s;tre&s;s and of pain; yet the want of any thing to which we have long been ac|cu&s;tomed, is a &s;ort of torture. A clue to guide us through all the intricacies of this labyrinth, would be an acceptable pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Whatever be the cau&s;e, it is an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed fact, that we are much influenced by cu&s;tom. It hath an effect upon our plea|&s;ures, upon our actions, and even upon our thoughts and &s;entiments. Habit makes no figure during the vivacity of youth; in middle age it gains ground; and in old age it governs without control. In that period of life, generally &s;peaking, we eat at a cer|tain hour, take exerci&s;e at a certain hour, go to re&s;t at a certain hour, all by the direc|tion of habit. Nay a particular &s;eat, table, bed, comes to be e&s;&s;ential. And a habit in
<PB N="84" REF="83">
any of the&s;e, cannot be contradicted without unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Any &s;light or moderate plea&s;ure frequent|ly reiterated for a long time, forms a con|nection betwixt us and the thing that cau&s;es the plea&s;ure. This connection, termed <HI>ha|bit,</HI> has the effect to rai&s;e our de&s;ire or ap|petite for that thing when it returns not as u&s;ual. During the cour&s;e of enjoyment, the plea&s;ure grows in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tronger till a habit be e&s;tabli&s;hed; at which time the plea&s;ure is at its height. It continues not however &s;tationary. The &s;ame cu&s;tomary reiteration which carried it to its height, brings it down again by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, even lower than it was at fir&s;t. But of this circum&s;tance afterward. What at pre&s;ent we have in view, is to prove by experiments, that tho&s;e things which at fir&s;t are but mo|derately agreeable, are the apte&s;t to be|come habitual. Spirituous liquors, at fir&s;t &s;carce agreeable, readily produce an habi|tual appetite; and cu&s;tom prevails &s;o far, as even to make us fond of things originally di&s;agreeable, &s;uch as coffee, a&s;&s;a-foetida, and

tobacco. This is plea&s;antly illu&s;trated by Congreve:

The catalogue was &s;o large, that I was not without hopes, one day or other, to hate her heartily: to which end I &s;o us'd my&s;elf to think of 'em, that at length, con|trary to my de&s;ign and expectation, they gave me every hour le&s;s and le&s;s di&s;turbance; till in a few days it became habitual to me, to remember 'em without being di&s;plea&s;ed.

A walk upon the quarterdeck, though in|tolerably confined, becomes however &s;o a|greeable by cu&s;tom, that a &s;ailor in his walk on &s;hore, confines him&s;elf commonly with|in the &s;ame bounds. I knew a man who had relinqui&s;hed the &s;ea for a country-life. In the corner of his garden he reared an ar|tificial mount with a level &s;ummit, re&s;em|bling mo&s;t accurately a quarterdeck, not only in &s;hape but in &s;ize; and this was his choice walk. Play or gaming, at fir&s;t bare|ly amu&s;ing by the occupation it affords, be|comes in time extremely agreeable; and is frequently pro&s;ecuted with avidity, as if it were the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of life. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to the plea&s;ures of the internal &s;en&s;es, tho&s;e of knowledge and virtue in particular. Children have &s;carce any &s;en&s;e of the&s;e plea&s;ures; and men very little, who are in the &s;tate of nature without culture. Our ta&s;te for virtue and know|ledge improves &s;lowly; but is capable of growing &s;tronger than any other appetite in human nature.</P>
<P>To introduce a habit, frequency of acts is not alone &s;ufficient: length of time is al|&s;o
<PB N="87" REF="86">
nece&s;&s;ary. The quicke&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acts in a &s;hort time, is not &s;ufficient; nor a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the longe&s;t time. The effect mu&s;t be produced by a moderate &s;oft action, and a long &s;eries of ea&s;y touches removed from each other by &s;hort intervals. Nor are the&s;e &s;ufficient, without regularity in the time, place, and other circum&s;tances of the action. The more uniform any operation is, the &s;ooner it becomes habitual; and this holds equally in a pa&s;&s;ive habit. Variety in any remarkable degree, prevents the effect. Thus any particular food will &s;carce ever become habitual, where the manner of dre&s;&s;ing is varied. The circum&s;tances then requi&s;ite to augment any plea&s;ure and at the long run to form a habit, are weak uniform acts, reiterated during a long cour&s;e of time without any con&s;iderable interruption. Eve|ry agreeable cau&s;e which operates in this manner, will grow habitual.</P>
<P><HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>aver&s;ion,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from pa&s;&s;ion on the one hand, and on the other from original di&s;po&s;ition, are in rea|lity habits re&s;pecting particular objects, ac|quired in the manner above &s;et forth. The
<PB N="88" REF="87">
plea&s;ure of &s;ocial intercour&s;e with any per|&s;on, mu&s;t originally be faint, and frequently reiterated, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the habit of affection. Affection thus generated, whe|ther it be friend&s;hip or love, &s;eldom &s;wells into any tumultuous or vigorous pa&s;|&s;ion; but is however the &s;tronge&s;t cement that can bind together two individuals of the human &s;pecies. In like manner, a &s;light degree of di&s;gu&s;t often reiterated with any degree of regularity, grows into the habit of aver&s;ion, which generally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts for life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e objects of ta&s;te that are the mo&s;t agreeable, are &s;o far from having a tenden|cy to become habitual, that too great in|dulgence fails not to produce &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. No man contracts a habit of ta|king &s;ugar, honey, or &s;weet-meats, as he doth of tobacco:

The &s;ame holds in the cau&s;es of all violent plea&s;ures: the&s;e cau&s;es are not naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of habit. Great pa&s;&s;ions &s;ud|denly rai&s;ed are incompatible with a habit of any &s;ort. In particular they never pro|duce affection or aver&s;ion. A man who at fir&s;t &s;ight falls violently in love, has a &s;trong de&s;ire of enjoyment, but no affection for the woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Violent love without affection is finely exemplified in the following &s;tory. When Con&s;tantinople was taken by the Turks, Irene, a young Greek of an illu&s;trious family, &s;ell into the hands of Mahomet II. who was at that time in the prime of youth and glory. Irene's charms conquered the &s;avage heart of Mahomet. He abandoned him&s;elf to his new mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;hut him&s;elf up with her, denying acce&s;s even to his mi|ni&s;ters. His pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to increa&s;e with time. In the mo&s;t important expeditions, frequently would he abandon the army, and fly to his Irene. War was at a &s;tand, for victory was no longer the monarch's favourite pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;oldiers, accu&s;tomed to booty, began to murmur, and the infection &s;pread even among the commanders. The Ba&s;ha Mu&s;tapha, con&s;ulting the fidelity he owed his ma&s;ter, was the fir&s;t who dur&s;t acquaint him of the di&s;cour&s;es held publicly to the pre|judice of his glory.</P>
<P>The Sultan, after a gloomy &s;ilence, formed his re&s;olution. He ordered Mu&s;tapha to a&s;&s;emble the troops next morning; and then retired with precipitation to Irene's apartment. Ne|ver before did that prince&s;s appear &s;o charming: never be|fore did the prince be&s;tow &s;o many tender care&s;&s;es. To give a new lu&s;tre to her beauty, he exhorted her women next morning to be&s;tow all their art and care on her dre&s;s. He took her by the hand, led her into the middle of the army, and pulling off her vail, demanded at the Ba&s;has with a fierce look, whether they had ever beheld &s;o accompli&s;hed a beauty? After an awful pau&s;e, Mahomet with one hand laying hold of the young Greek by her beautiful locks, and with the o|ther pulling out his &s;imitar, &s;evered the head from the body at one &s;troke. Then turning to his grandees, with eyes wild and furious, <Q REND="inline">"This &s;word,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"when it is my will, knows to cut the bands of love."</Q></P></NOTE>. A man who is &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="90" REF="89">
with an unexpected favour, burns for an opportunity to exert his gratitude, without having any affection for his benefactor. Neither does de&s;ire of vengeance for an a|trocious injury involve aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is perhaps not ea&s;y to &s;ay why mode|rate plea&s;ures gather &s;trength by cu&s;tom. But two cau&s;es concur to prevent this effect
<PB N="91" REF="90">
in the more inten&s;e plea&s;ures. The&s;e, by an original law in our nature, increa&s;e quickly to their full growth, and decay with no le&s;s precipitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 3.</NOTE>; and cu&s;tom is too &s;low in its operation to overcome this law. Another cau&s;e is not le&s;s powerful. The mind is exhau&s;ted with plea&s;ure as well as with pain. Exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure is ex|tremely fatiguing; occa&s;ioning, as a natu|rali&s;t would &s;ay, great expence of animal &s;pirits<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Lady Ea&s;y, upon her hu&s;band's reformation, expre&s;&s;es to her friend the following &s;entiment. <Q REND="inline">"Be &s;atisfy'd; Sir Charles has made me happy, even to a pain of joy."</Q></P></NOTE>. And therefore, of &s;uch the mind cannot bear &s;o frequent gratification as to &s;uperinduce a habit. If the thing which rai&s;es the plea&s;ure return before the mind have recovered its tone and reli&s;h, di&s;gu&s;t en&s;ues in&s;tead of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A habit never fails to admoni&s;h us of the wonted time of gratification, by rai&s;ing a pain for want of the object, and a de&s;ire to have it. The pain of want is always fir&s;t felt; the de&s;ire naturally follows; and upon
<PB N="92" REF="91">
pre&s;enting the object, both vani&s;h in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly. Thus a man accu&s;tomed to to|bacco, feels, at the end of the u&s;ual inter|val, a confu&s;ed pain of want, which in its fir&s;t appearance points at nothing in parti|cular, though it &s;oon &s;ettles upon its accu|&s;tomed object. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved in per&s;ons addicted to drinking, who are often in an unea&s;y re&s;tle&s;s &s;tate before they think of their bottle. In plea&s;ures indul|ged regularly and at equal intervals, the appetite, remarkably ob&s;equious to cu&s;tom, returns regularly with the u&s;ual time of gra|tification; and a &s;ight of the object in the interim, has &s;carce any power to move it. This pain of want ari&s;ing from habit, &s;eems directly oppo&s;ite to that of &s;atiety. Singular it mu&s;t appear, that frequency of gratifica|tion &s;hould produce effects &s;o oppo&s;ite as are the pains of exce&s;s and of want.</P>
<P>The appetites that re&s;pect the pre&s;erva|tion and propagation of our &s;pecies, are at|tended with a pain of want &s;imilar to that occa&s;ioned by habit. Hunger and thir&s;t are unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of want, which al|ways precede the de&s;ire of eating or drink|ing:
<PB N="93" REF="92">
and a pain for want of carnal enjoy|ment precedes the de&s;ire of a proper object. The pain being thus felt independent of an object, cannot be cured but by gratifi|cation. An ordinary pa&s;&s;ion, in which de|&s;ire precedes the pain of want, is in a differ|ent condition. It is never felt but while the object is in view; and therefore by remo|ving the object out of thought, it vani&s;heth with its de&s;ire and pain of want<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e natural appetites above mentioned, differ from habit in the following particular, They have an undetermined direction to|ward all objects of gratification in general; whereas an habitual appetite is directed upon a particular object. The attachment we have by habit to a particular woman, differs widely from the natural pa&s;&s;ion which comprehends the whole &s;ex; and the habitual reli&s;h for a particular di&s;h, is far from being the &s;ame with a vague appetite for food. Notwith&s;tanding this difference, it is &s;till remarkable, that nature hath in|forced the gratification of certain natural
<PB N="94" REF="93">
appetites e&s;&s;ential to the &s;pecies, by a pain of the &s;ame &s;ort with that which habit produ|ceth.</P>
<P>The pain of habit is le&s;s under our power, than any other pain for want of gratification. Hunger and thir&s;t are more ea&s;ily endured, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t, than an unu&s;ual intermi&s;|&s;ion of any habitual plea&s;ure. We often hear per&s;ons declaring, they would forego &s;leep or food, rather than &s;nuff or any other habitual trifle. We mu&s;t not however con|clude, that the gratification of an habitual appetite affords the &s;ame delight with the gratification of one that is natural. Far from it: the pain of want only is greater.</P>
<P>The &s;low and reiterated acts that produce a habit, &s;trengthen the mind to enjoy the habitual plea&s;ure in greater quantity and more frequency than originally; and by this means a habit of intemperate gratification is often formed. After unbounded acts of in|temperance, the habitual reli&s;h is &s;oon re&s;to|red, and the pain for want of enjoyment re|turns with fre&s;h vigor.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of the plea&s;ant emotions hi|therto in view, are either an individual, &s;uch
<PB N="95" REF="94">
as a companion, a certain dwelling-place, certain amu&s;ements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>; or a particular &s;pecies, &s;uch as coffee, mutton, or any par|ticular food. But habit is not confined to the&s;e. A con&s;tant train of trifling diver|&s;ions, may form &s;uch a habit in the mind, as that it cannot be ea&s;y a moment without amu&s;ement. Variety in the objects prevents a habit as to any one in particular; but as the train is uniform with re&s;pect to amu&s;e|ment in general, the habit is formed accor|dingly; and this &s;ort of habit may be deno|minated <HI>a generic habit,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the former, which may be called <HI>a &s;pecific habit.</HI> A habit of a town-life, of country-&s;ports, of &s;olitude, of reading, or of bu&s;ine&s;s, where &s;ufficiently varied, are in&s;tances of generic habits. It ought to be remarked, that eve|ry &s;pecific habit hath a mixture of the ge|neric. The habit of one particular &s;ort of food, makes the ta&s;te agreeable; and we are fond of this ta&s;te where-ever found. A man deprived of an habitual object, takes up with what mo&s;t re&s;embles it: deprived of tobacco, any bitter herb will do, rather than want. The habit of drinking punch,
<PB N="96" REF="95">
makes wine a good re&s;ource. A man ac|cu&s;tomed to the &s;weet &s;ociety and comforts of matrimony, being unhappily deprived of his beloved object, inclines the &s;ooner to a &s;econd choice. In general, the quality which the mo&s;t affects us in an habitual ob|ject, produceth, when we are deprived of it, a &s;trong appetite for that quality in any other object.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned above, why the cau&s;es of inten&s;e plea&s;ure become not readi|ly habitual. But now I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the&s;e rea&s;ons conclude only again&s;t &s;pecific habits. With regard to any particular ob|ject that is the cau&s;e of a weak plea&s;ure, a habit is formed by frequency and uniformi|ty of reiteration, which in the ca&s;e of an in|ten&s;e plea&s;ure cannot obtain without &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. But it is remarkable, that &s;a|tiety and di&s;gu&s;t have no effect, except as to that thing which occa&s;ions them. A &s;ur|feit of honey produceth not a loathing of &s;u|gar; and intemperance with one woman, produceth no di&s;reli&s;h of the &s;ame plea&s;ure with others. Hence it is ea&s;y to account for a generic habit in any &s;trong plea&s;ure.
<PB N="97" REF="96">
The di&s;gu&s;t of intemperance, is confined to the object by which it is produced. The delight we had in the gratification of the ap|petite, inflames the imagination, and makes us, with avidity, &s;earch for the &s;ame gratifi|cation in whatever other object it can be found. And thus frequency and uniformi|ty in gratifying the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion upon dif|ferent objects, produceth at the longrun a habit. In this manner, a man acquires an habitual delight in high and poignant &s;auces, rich dre&s;s, fine equipage, crowds of compa|ny, and in whatever is commonly termed <HI>plea&s;ure.</HI> There concurs at the &s;ame time to introduce this habit, a peculiarity ob&s;er|ved above, that reiteration of acts enlarges the capacity of the mind, to admit a more plentiful gratification than originally, with regard to frequency as well as quantity.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that though a &s;pecific habit can only take place in the ca&s;e of a moderate plea&s;ure, yet that a generic habit may be formed with re&s;pect to every &s;ort of plea&s;ure, moderate or immoderate, that can be gratified by a variety of objects indiffer|ently. The only difference is, that any par|ticular

object which cau&s;es a weak plea&s;ure, runs naturally into a &s;pecific habit; whereas a particular object that cau&s;es an inten&s;e plea&s;ure, is altogether incapable of &s;uch a habit. In a word, it is but in &s;ingular ca&s;es that a moderate plea&s;ure produces a generic habit: an inten&s;e plea&s;ure, on the other hand, cannot produce any other habit.</P>
<P>The appetites that re&s;pect the pre&s;ervation and propagation of the &s;pecies, are formed into habit in a peculiar manner. The time as well as mea&s;ure of their gratification, are much under the power of cu&s;tom; which, by introducing a change upon the body, oc|ca&s;ions a proportional change in the appe|tites. Thus, if the body be gradually form|ed to a certain quantity of food at regu|lar times, the appetite is regulated accor|dingly; and the appetite is again changed when a different habit of body is introdu|ced by a different practice. Here it would &s;eem, that the change is not made upon the mind, which is commonly the ca&s;e in pa&s;&s;ive habits, but only upon the body.</P>
<P>When rich food is brought down by in|gredients of a plainer ta&s;te, the compo&s;ition

is &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;pecific habit. Thus the &s;weet ta&s;te of &s;ugar, rendered le&s;s poignant in a mixture, may, in cour&s;e of time, pro|duce a &s;pecific habit for &s;uch mixture.

<P>The beauty of the human figure, by a &s;pecial recommendation of nature, appears to us &s;upreme, amid the great variety of beauteous forms be&s;towed upon animals. The various degrees in which individuals enjoy this property, render it an object &s;ometimes of a moderate &s;ometimes of an inten&s;e pa&s;&s;ion. The moderate pa&s;&s;ion, admitting frequent reiteration without dimi|nution, and occupying the mind without exhau&s;ting it, becomes gradually &s;tronger till it &s;ettle in a habit. So true this is, that in&s;tances are not wanting, of an ugly face, at fir&s;t di&s;agreeable, afterward rendered in|different by familiarity, and at the longrun agreeable. On the other hand, con&s;um|mate beauty, at the very fir&s;t view, fills the mind &s;o as to admit no increa&s;e. En|joyment

in this ca&s;e le&s;&s;ens the plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 3.</NOTE>; and if often repeated, ends commonly in &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. Con&s;tant experi|ence &s;hows, that the emotions created by great beauty become weaker by fami|liarity. The impre&s;&s;ions made &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively by &s;uch an object, &s;trong at fir&s;t and le&s;&s;ening by degrees, con&s;titute a &s;eries oppo&s;ite to that of the weak and increa&s;ing emotions, which grow into a &s;pecific habit. But the mind, when accu&s;tomed to beauty, contracts a reli&s;h for it in general, though often repelled from particular objects by the pain of &s;atiety. Thus a generic habit is formed, of which incon&s;tancy in love is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. For a generic habit, comprehending every beautiful object, is an invincible ob&s;truction to a &s;pecific habit, which is confined to one.</P>
<P>But a matter which is of great import|ance to the youth of both &s;exes, de&s;erves more than a cur&s;ory view. Though the plea&s;ant emotion of beauty differs widely from the corporeal appetite, yet both may
<PB N="101" REF="100">
concur upon the &s;ame object. When this is the ca&s;e, they inflame the imagination; and produce a very &s;trong complex pa&s;|&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>, which is incapable of increa&s;e, be|cau&s;e the mind as to plea&s;ure is limited ra|ther more than as to pain. Enjoyment in this ca&s;e mu&s;t be exqui&s;ite, and therefore more apt to produce &s;atiety than in any o|ther ca&s;e whatever. This is a never-failing effect, where con&s;ummate beauty on the one &s;ide, meets with a warm imagination and great &s;en&s;ibility on the other. What I am here explaining, is the naked truth without exaggeration. They mu&s;t be in|&s;en&s;ible upon whom this doctrine makes no impre&s;&s;ion; and it de&s;erves well to be pon|dered by the young and the amorous, who in forming a &s;ociety which is not di&s;&s;olvable, are too often blindly impelled by the ani|mal plea&s;ure merely, inflamed by beauty. It may indeed happen after this plea&s;ure is gone, and go it mu&s;t with a &s;wift pace, that a new connection is formed upon more dignified and more la&s;ting principles. But
<PB N="102" REF="101">
this is a dangerous experiment. For even &s;uppo&s;ing good &s;en&s;e, good temper, and in|ternal merit of every &s;ort, which is a very favourable &s;uppo&s;ition, yet a new connection upon the&s;e qualifications is rarely formed. It generally or rather always happens, that &s;uch qualifications, the only &s;olid foundation of an indi&s;&s;oluble connection, are rendered altogether invi&s;ible by &s;atiety of enjoyment creating di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>One effect of cu&s;tom, different from any that have been explained, mu&s;t not be o|mitted, becau&s;e it makes a great figure in human nature. Cu&s;tom augments mode|rate plea&s;ures, and dimini&s;hes tho&s;e that are inten&s;e. It has a different effect with re|&s;pect to pain; for it blunts the edge of every &s;ort of pain and di&s;tre&s;s great and &s;mall. Uninterrupted mi&s;ery therefore is attended with one good effect. If its tor|ments be ince&s;&s;ant, cu&s;tom hardens us to bear them.</P>
<P>It is extremely curious, to remark the gradual changes that are made in forming habits. Moderate plea&s;ures are augmented gradually by reiteration till they become
<PB N="103" REF="102">
habitual; and then are at their height. But they are not long &s;tationary; for from that point they gradually decay till they vani&s;h altogether. The pain occa&s;ioned by the want of gratification, runs a very differ|ent cour&s;e. This pain increa&s;es uniformly; and at la&s;t becomes extreme, when the plea&s;ure of gratification is reduced to nothing.

The effect of cu&s;tom with relation to a &s;pe|cific habit, is di&s;played through all its varie|ties in the u&s;e of tobacco. The ta&s;te of this plant is at fir&s;t extremely unplea&s;ant. Our di&s;gu&s;t le&s;&s;ens gradually till it vani&s;h al|together; at which period the plant is nei|ther agreeable nor di&s;agreeable. Continu|ing the u&s;e, we begin to reli&s;h it; and our reli&s;h increa&s;es by u&s;e till it come to its ut|mo&s;t extent. From this &s;tate it gradually decays, while the habit becomes &s;tronger
<PB N="104" REF="103">
and &s;tronger, and con&s;equently the pain of want. The re&s;ult is, that when the habit has acquired its greate&s;t vigor, the plea&s;ure of gratification is gone. And hence it is, that we often &s;moke and take &s;nuff habi|tually, without &s;o much as being con&s;cious of the operation. We mu&s;t except gratifi|cation after the pain of want; becau&s;e gra|tification in that ca&s;e is at the height when the habit is &s;tronge&s;t. It is of the &s;ame kind with the joy one feels upon being de|livered from the rack, the cau&s;e of which is explained above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>. This plea&s;ure however is but occa&s;ionally the effect of habit; and however exqui&s;ite, is guarded again&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible, by preventing want.</P>
<P>With regard to the pain of want, I can di&s;cover no difference betwixt a generic and &s;pecific habit: the pain is the &s;ame in both. But the&s;e habits differ widely with re&s;pect to the po&s;itive plea&s;ure. I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the plea&s;ure of a &s;pecific habit decays gradually till it become imperceptible. Not &s;o the plea&s;ure of a ge|neric
<PB N="105" REF="104">
habit. So far as I can di&s;cover, this plea&s;ure &s;uffers little or no decay after it comes to its height. The variety of gratifi|cation pre&s;erves it entire. However it may be with other generic habits, the ob&s;erva|tion I am certain holds with re&s;pect to the plea&s;ures of virtue and of knowledge. The plea&s;ure of doing good has &s;uch an un|bounded &s;cope, and may be &s;o variou&s;ly gratified, that it can never decay. Science is equally unbounded; and our appetite for knowledge has an ample range of gratifica|tion, where di&s;coveries are recommended by novelty, by variety, by utility, or by all of them.</P>
<P>Here is a large field of facts and experi|ments, and &s;everal phenomena unfolded, the cau&s;es of which have been occa&s;ionally &s;ugge&s;ted. The efficient cau&s;e of the power of cu&s;tom over man, a fundamental point in the pre&s;ent chapter, has unhappily evaded my keene&s;t &s;earch; and now I am reduced to hold it an original branch of the human con&s;titution, though I have no better rea&s;on for my opinion, than that I cannot re&s;olve it into any other principle. But with re&s;pect
<PB N="106" REF="105">
to the final cau&s;e, a point of &s;till greater im|portance, I promi&s;e my&s;elf more &s;ucce&s;s. It cannot indeed have e&s;caped any thinking per&s;on, that the power of cu&s;tom is a happy contrivance for our good. Exqui&s;ite plea|&s;ure produceth &s;atiety: moderate plea&s;ure becomes &s;tronger by cu&s;tom. Bu&s;ine&s;s is our province, and plea&s;ure our relaxation only. Hence, &s;atiety is nece&s;&s;ary to check exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures, which otherwi&s;e would ingro&s;s the mind, and unqualify us for bu|&s;ine&s;s. On the other hand, habitual increa&s;e of moderate plea&s;ure, and even conver&s;ion of pain into plea&s;ure, are admirably contri|ved for di&s;appointing the malice of Fortune, and for reconciling us to whatever cour&s;e of life may be our lot:

<P>The foregoing di&s;tinction betwixt inten&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="106">
and moderate, holds in plea&s;ure only, not in pain, every degree of which is &s;oftened by time and cu&s;tom. Cu&s;tom is a catholi|con for pain and di&s;tre&s;s of every &s;ort; and of this regulation the final cau&s;e is &s;o evi|dent as to require no illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Another final cau&s;e of cu&s;tom will be highly reli&s;hed by every per&s;on of humani|ty; and yet has in a great mea&s;ure been o|verlooked. Cu&s;tom hath a greater influ|ence than any other known principle, to put the rich and poor upon a level. Weak plea&s;ures, which fall to the &s;hare of the lat|ter, become fortunately &s;tronger by cu&s;tom; while voluptuous plea&s;ures, the lot of the former, are continually lo&s;ing ground by &s;atiety. Men of fortune, who po&s;&s;e&s;s pala|ces, &s;umptuous gardens, rich fields, enjoy them le&s;s than pa&s;&s;engers do. The goods of Fortune are not unequally di&s;tributed: the opulent po&s;&s;e&s;s what others enjoy.</P>
<P>And indeed, if it be the effect of habit to produce the pain of want in a high de|gree while there is little plea&s;ure in enjoy|ment, a voluptuous life is of all the lea&s;t to be envied. Tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed
<PB N="108" REF="107">
to high feeding, ea&s;y vehicles, rich furni|ture, a crowd of valets, much deference and flattery, enjoy but a &s;mall &s;hare of happi|ne&s;s, while they are expo&s;ed to manifold di&s;tre&s;&s;es. To &s;uch a man, in&s;laved by ea&s;e and luxury, even the petty inconveniencies of a rough road, bad weather, or homely fare on a journey, are &s;erious evils. He lo&s;es his tone of mind, becomes peevi&s;h, and would wreak his re&s;entment even upon the common accidents of life. Better far to u&s;e the goods of Fortune with moderation. A man who by temperance and activity has acquired a hardy con&s;titution, is, on the one hand, guarded again&s;t external accidents, and is, on the other, provided with great variety of enjoyment ever at command.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of a que&s;tion more delicate than ab|&s;tru&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> What authority cu&s;tom ought to have over our ta&s;te in the fine arts? It is proper to be premi&s;ed, that we chearfully abandon to its authority every thing that na|ture leaves to our choice, and where the preference we be&s;tow has no foundation o|ther than whim or fancy. There appears
<PB N="109" REF="108">
no original difference betwixt the right and the left hand: cu&s;tom however has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a difference, &s;o as to make it auk|ward and di&s;agreeable to u&s;e the left where the right is commonly u&s;ed. The various colours, though they affect us differently, are all of them agreeable in their purity, But cu&s;tom has regulated this matter in an|other manner: a black &s;kin upon a human creature, is to us di&s;agreeable; and a white &s;kin probably not le&s;s &s;o to a negro. Thus things originally indifferent, become agree|able or di&s;agreeable by the force of cu&s;tom. Nor ought this to be &s;urpri&s;ing after the di&s;|covery made above, that the original agree|ablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of an object, is, by the influence of cu&s;tom, often converted into the oppo&s;ite quality.</P>
<P>Concerning now tho&s;e matters of ta&s;te where there is naturally a preference of one thing before another; it is certain, in the fir&s;t place, that our faint and more delicate feelings are readily &s;u&s;ceptible of a bias from cu&s;tom; and therefore that it is no proof of a defective ta&s;te, to find the&s;e in &s;ome mea|&s;ure under the government of cu&s;tom.
<PB N="110" REF="109">
Dre&s;s, and the modes of external behaviour, are ju&s;tly regulated by cu&s;tom in every country. The deep red or vermilion with which the ladies in France cover their cheeks, appears to them beautiful in &s;pite of nature; and &s;trangers cannot altogether be ju&s;tified in condemning this practice, con&s;i|dering the lawful authority of cu&s;tom, or of the <HI>fa&s;hion,</HI> as it is called. It is told of the people who inhabit the &s;kirts of the Alps facing the north, that the &s;welling they univer&s;ally have in the neck is to them agreeable. So far has cu&s;tom power to change the nature of things, and to make an object originally di&s;agreeable take on an oppo&s;ite appearance.</P>
<P>But as to the emotions of propriety and impropriety, and in general as to all emo|tions involving the &s;en&s;e of right or wrong, cu&s;tom has little authority, and ought to have none at all. Emotions of this kind, be|ing qualified with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duty, take naturally place of every other feeling; and it argues a &s;hameful weakne&s;s or dege|neracy of mind, to find them in any ca&s;e &s;o far &s;ubdued as to &s;ubmit to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">
The&s;e few hints may enable us to judge in &s;ome mea&s;ure of foreign manners, whe|ther exhibited by foreign writers or our own. A compari&s;on betwixt the ancients and the moderns, was &s;ome time ago a favourite &s;ubject. Tho&s;e who declared for the for|mer, thought it a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification of ancient manners, that they were &s;upported by the authority of cu&s;tom. Their antago|ni&s;ts, on the other hand, refu&s;ing &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to cu&s;tom as a &s;tandard of ta&s;te, con|demned ancient manners in &s;everal in&s;tances as irrational. In this controver&s;y, an appeal being made to different principles, without the &s;lighte&s;t attempt on either &s;ide to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a common &s;tandard, the di&s;pute could have no end. The hints above given tend to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;tandard, for judging how far the lawful authority of cu&s;tom may be ex|tended, and within what limits it ought to be confined. For the &s;ake of illu&s;tration, we &s;hall apply this &s;tandard in a few in&s;tan|ces.</P>
<P>Human &s;acrifices, the cruelle&s;t effect of blind and groveling &s;uper&s;tition, wore gra|dually out of u&s;e by the prevalence of rea|&s;on
<PB N="112" REF="111">
and humanity. In the days of Sopho|cles and Euripides, the traces of this &s;avage practice were &s;till recent; and the Athe|nians, through the prevalence of cu&s;tom, could without di&s;gu&s;t &s;uffer human &s;acrifices to be repre&s;ented in their theatre. The I|phigenia of Euripides is a proof of this fact. But a human &s;acrifice, being altoge|ther incon&s;i&s;tent with modern manners, as producing horror in&s;tead of pity, cannot with any propriety be introduced upon a modern &s;tage. I mu&s;t therefore condemn the Iphigenia of Racine, which, in&s;tead of the tender and &s;ympathetic pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ub&s;ti|tutes di&s;gu&s;t and horror. But this is not all. Another objection occurs again&s;t every fable that deviates &s;o remarkably from improved notions and &s;entiments. If it &s;hould even command our belief, by the authority of genuine hi&s;tory, its fictitious and unnatural appearance, however, would prevent its ta|king &s;uch hold of the mind as to produce a perception of reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>. A human &s;acrifice is &s;o unnatural, and to us &s;o improbable,
<PB N="113" REF="112">
that few will be affected with the repre&s;en|tation of it more than with a fairy tale. The objection fir&s;t mentioned &s;trikes al&s;o again&s;t the <HI>Phedra</HI> of this author. The queen's pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;tep&s;on, being unnatural and beyond all bounds, creates aver&s;ion and hor|ror rather than compa&s;&s;ion. The author in his preface ob&s;erves, that the queen's pa&s;|&s;ion, however unnatural, was the effect of de&s;tiny and the wrath of the gods; and he puts the &s;ame excu&s;e in her own mouth. But what is the wrath of a heathen god to us Chri&s;tians? We acknowledge no de&s;ti|ny in pa&s;&s;ion; and if love be unnatural, it never can be reli&s;hed. A &s;uppo&s;ition, like what our author lays hold of, may po&s;&s;ibly cover &s;light improprieties; but it will ne|ver engage our &s;ympathy for what appears to us frantic or extravagant.</P>
<P>Neither can I reli&s;h the cata&s;trophe of this tragedy. A man of ta&s;te may peru&s;e, without di&s;gu&s;t, a Grecian performance de&s;cribing a &s;ea-mon&s;ter &s;ent by Neptune to de&s;troy Hippolytus. He con&s;iders, that &s;uch a &s;to|ry might agree with the religious creed of Greece; and, entering into ancient opi|nions,
<PB N="114" REF="113">
may be plea&s;ed with the &s;tory, as what probably had a &s;trong effect upon a Grecian audience. But he cannot have the &s;ame indulgence for &s;uch a repre&s;entation upon a modern &s;tage; for no &s;tory which carries a violent air of fiction, can ever move us in any con&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Co&euml;phores</HI> of E&s;chylus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 2.</NOTE>, Ore&s;tes is made to &s;ay, that he was commanded by Apollo to avenge his father's murder; and yet if he obeyed, that he was to be deli|vered to the furies, or be &s;truck with &s;ome horrible malady. The tragedy according|ly concludes with a chorus, deploring the fate of Ore&s;tes, obliged to take vengeance again&s;t a mother, and involved thereby in a crime again&s;t his will. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any man at pre&s;ent to accommodate his mind to opinions &s;o irrational and ab&s;urd, which mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t him in peru&s;ing even a Grecian &s;tory. Among the Greeks again, gro&s;sly &s;uper&s;titious, it was a common opi|nion, that the report of a man's death was a pre&s;age of his death; and Ore&s;tes, in
<PB N="115" REF="114">
the fir&s;t act of <HI>Electra,</HI> &s;preading a report of his own death in order to blind his mo|ther and her adulterer, is even in this ca&s;e affected with the pre&s;age. Such im|becility can never find grace with a modern audience. It may indeed produce &s;ome degree of compa&s;&s;ion for a people afflicted to &s;uch a degree with ab&s;urd terrors, &s;imilar to what is felt in peru&s;ing a de&s;cription of the Hottentotes: but manners of this kind will not intere&s;t our affections, nor excite any degree of &s;ocial concern.</P>

beauty, which makes &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;|&s;ion, is known to re&s;ult, not &s;o much from regular features and a fine complexion, as from good nature, good &s;en&s;e, &s;prightline&s;s, &s;weetne&s;s, or other mental quality, ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome way upon the countenance. Though perfect &s;kill in this language be rare, yet &s;o much knowledge of it is diffu&s;ed through mankind, as to be &s;ufficient for the ordinary events of life. But by what means we come to under&s;tand this language, is a point of &s;ome intricacy. It cannot be by &s;ight merely; for upon the mo&s;t atten|tive in&s;pection of the human vi&s;age, all that can be di&s;cerned are figure, colour, and motion; and yet the&s;e, &s;ingly or com|bined, never can repre&s;ent a pa&s;&s;ion or a &s;entiment.

Where then is the in|&s;tructor to be found, that can unvail this &s;ecret connection? If we apply to expe|rience, it is yielded, that from long and di|ligent ob&s;ervation, we may gather in &s;ome

mind it will be convenient to &s;u&s;pend the inquiry, till we be better acquainted with the nature of external &s;igns and with their operations. The&s;e articles therefore &s;hall be premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion are of two kinds, voluntary and involuntary. The voluntary &s;igns are al&s;o of two kinds: &s;ome are arbitrary and &s;ome natural. Words are arbitrary &s;igns, excepting a few &s;imple &s;ounds expre&s;&s;ive of certain internal emo|tions; and the&s;e &s;ounds, being the &s;ame in all languages, mu&s;t be the work of nature. But though words are arbitrary, the manner of employing them is not altogether &s;o; for each pa&s;&s;ion has by nature peculiar ex|pre&s;&s;ions and tones &s;uited to it. Thus the unpremeditated tones of admiration, are the &s;ame in all men; as al&s;o of compa&s;&s;ion, re&s;entment, and de&s;pair. Dramatic wri|ters ought to be well acquainted with this natural manner of expre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion. The chief talent of a fine writer, is a ready com|mand of the expre&s;&s;ions that nature dic|tates to every man when any vivid emotion &s;truggles for utterance; and the chief ta|lent
<PB N="120" REF="119">
of a fine reader, is a ready command of the tones &s;uited to the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The other kind of voluntary &s;igns, com|prehends certain attitudes and ge&s;tures that naturally accompany certain emo|tions with a &s;urpri&s;ing uniformity. Thus exce&s;&s;ive joy is expre&s;&s;ed by leaping, dan|cing, or &s;ome elevation of the body; and exce&s;&s;ive grief by &s;inking or depre&s;&s;ing it. Thus pro&s;tration and kneeling have been employ'd by all nations and in all ages to &s;ignify profound veneration. Another cir|cum&s;tance, &s;till more than uniformity, de mon&s;trates the&s;e ge&s;tures to be natural, <HI>viz.</HI> their remarkable conformity or re&s;emblance to the pa&s;&s;ions that produce them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 6.</NOTE>. Joy, which produceth a chearful elevation of mind, is expre&s;&s;ed by an elevation of body. Pride, magnanimity, courage, and the whole tribe of elevating pa&s;&s;ions, are expre&s;&s;ed by external ge&s;tures that are the &s;ame as to the circum&s;tance of elevation, however di&s;tingui&s;hable in other re&s;pects. Hence it comes, that an erect po&s;ture is a &s;ign or expre&s;&s;ion of dignity:
<Q><PB N="121" REF="120">
<L>Two of far nobler &s;hape, erect and tall,</L>
<L>Godlike erect, with native honour clad,</L>
<L>In naked maje&s;ty, &s;eem'd lords of all.</L>
<BIBL>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, book 4.</BIBL></Q>
Grief, on the other hand, as well as re&s;pect, which depre&s;s the mind, cannot for that rea&s;on be expre&s;&s;ed more &s;ignificantly than by a &s;imilar depre&s;&s;ion of the body. Hence, <HI>to be ca&s;t down,</HI> is a common phra&s;e, &s;igni|fying to be grieved or di&s;pirited.</P>
<P>One would not imagine, who has not given peculiar attention, that the body is &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch a variety of attitude and motion, as readily to accompany every dif|ferent emotion with a corre&s;ponding ge&s;ture. Humility, for example, is expre&s;&s;ed natu|rally by hanging the head; arrogance, by its elevation; and langour or de&s;pondence, by reclining it to one &s;ide. The expre&s;&s;ions of the hands are manifold. By different at|titudes and motions, the hands expre&s;s de|&s;ire, hope, fear: they a&s;&s;i&s;t us in promi|&s;ing, in inviting, in keeping one at a di|&s;tance: they are made in&s;truments of threat|ening, of &s;upplication, of prai&s;e, and of
<PB N="122" REF="121">
horror: they are employ'd in approving, in refu&s;ing, in que&s;tioning; in &s;howing our joy, our &s;orrow, our doubts, our regret, our admiration. The&s;e ge&s;tures, &s;o obe|dient to pa&s;&s;ion, are extremely difficult to be imitated in a calm &s;tate. The ancients, &s;en&s;ible of the advantage as well as difficul|ty of having the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions at command, be&s;towed much time and care, in collecting them from ob&s;ervation, and in dige&s;ting them into a practical art, which was taught in their &s;chools as an important branch of education.</P>
<P>The foregoing &s;igns, though in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e voluntary, cannot however be re|&s;trained but with the utmo&s;t difficulty when they are prompted by pa&s;&s;ion. Of this we &s;carce need a &s;tronger proof, than the ge&s;tures of a keen player at bowls. Ob&s;erve only how he wreaths his body, in order to re&s;tore a &s;tray bowl to the right track. It is one article of good breeding, to &s;uppre&s;s, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e ex|ternal &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion, that we may not in company appear too warm or too intere&s;ted. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds in &s;peech. A

pa&s;&s;ion, it is true, when in extreme, is &s;i|lent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 17.</NOTE>; but when le&s;s violent, it mu&s;t be vented in words, which have a peculiar force, not to be equalled in a &s;edate com|po&s;ition. The ea&s;e and tru&s;t we have in a confident, encourages us no doubt to talk of our&s;elves and of our feelings. But the cau&s;e is more general; for it operates when we are alone as well as in company. Pa&s;&s;ion is the cau&s;e; for in many in&s;tances it is no &s;light gratification to vent a pa&s;&s;ion ex|ternally by words as well as by ge&s;tures. Some pa&s;&s;ions, when at a certain height, impel us &s;o &s;trongly to vent them in words, that we &s;peak with an audible voice even where there is none to li&s;ten. It is this cir|cum&s;tance in pa&s;&s;ion, that ju&s;tifies &s;olilo|quies; and it is this circum&s;tance that proves them to be natural<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Though a &s;oliloquy in the perturbation of pa&s;&s;ion is un|doubtedly natural, and indeed not unfrequent in real life; yet Congreve, who him&s;elf has penned &s;everal good &s;oliloquies, yields, with more candor than knowledge, that they are un|natural; and he only pretends to ju&s;tify them from nece&s;&s;ity. This he does in his dedication of the <HI>Double Dealer,</HI> in the following words. <Q REND="inline">"When a man in &s;oliloquy rea&s;ons with him&s;elf, and <HI>pro's</HI> and <HI>con's,</HI> and weighs all his de|&s;igns; we ought not to imagine, that this man either talks to us, or to him&s;elf; he is only thinking, and thinking (frequently) &s;uch matter as were inexcu&s;eable folly in him to &s;peak. But becau&s;e we are concealed &s;pectators of the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it nece&s;&s;ary to let us know the whole my&s;tery of his contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this per&s;on's thoughts; and to that end is forced to make u&s;e of the expedient of &s;peech, no other better way being yet invented for the communication of thought."</Q></P></NOTE>. The mind
<PB N="124" REF="123">
&s;ometimes favours this impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, by be&s;towing a temporary &s;en&s;ibility upon any object at hand, in order to make it a confident. Thus in the <HI>Winter's Tale</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 3. &s;c. 6.</NOTE>, Antigonus addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to an infant whom he was ordered to expo&s;e:

<P><PB N="125" REF="124">
The involuntary &s;igns, which are all of them natural, are either peculiar to one pa&s;|&s;ion or common to many. Every violent pa&s;&s;ion hath an external expre&s;&s;ion peculiar to it&s;elf, not excepting plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions: witne&s;s admiration and mirth. The plea|&s;ant emotions that are le&s;s vivid, have one common expre&s;&s;ion; from which we may gather the &s;trength of the emotion, but &s;carce the kind: we perceive a chearful or contented look; and we can make no more of it. Painful pa&s;&s;ions, being all of them violent, are di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other by their external expre&s;&s;ions. Thus fear, &s;hame, anger, anxiety, dejection, de&s;pair, have each of them peculiar expre&s;&s;ions; which are apprehended without the lea&s;t confu&s;ion. Some of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions produce violent effects upon the body, &s;uch as trem|bling, &s;tarting, and &s;wooning. But the&s;e effects, depending in a good mea&s;ure upon &s;ingularity of con&s;titution, are not uniform in all men.</P>
<P>The involuntary &s;igns, &s;uch of them as are di&s;play'd upon the countenance, are of two kinds. Some make their appearance
<PB N="126" REF="125">
occa&s;ionally with the emotions that produce them, and vani&s;h with the emotions: o|thers are formed gradually by &s;ome violent pa&s;&s;ion often recurring; and, becoming per|manent &s;igns of this prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, &s;erve to denote the di&s;po&s;ition or temper. The face of an infant indicates no particular di&s;|po&s;ition, becau&s;e it cannot be marked with any character to which time is nece&s;&s;ary. And even the temporary &s;igns are extremely aukward, being the fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ays of Na|ture to di&s;cover internal feelings. Thus the &s;hrieking of a new-born infant, with|out tears or &s;obbings, is plainly an at|tempt to weep. Some of the temporary &s;igns, as &s;miling and frowning, cannot be ob&s;erved for &s;ome months after birth. The permanent &s;igns, formed in youth while the body is &s;oft and flexible, are pre&s;erved entire by the firmne&s;s and &s;olidity which the body acquires; and are never oblitera|ted even by a change of temper. Perma|nent &s;igns are not produced after a certain age when the fibres become rigid; &s;ome violent ca&s;es excepted, &s;uch as reiterated fits of the gout or &s;tone through a cour&s;e of
<PB N="127" REF="126">
time. But the&s;e &s;igns are not &s;o ob&s;tinate as what are produced in youth; for when the cau&s;e is removed, they gradually wear away, and at la&s;t vani&s;h.</P>
<P>The natural &s;igns of emotions, voluntary and involuntary, being nearly the &s;ame in all men, form an univer&s;al language, which no di&s;tance of place, no difference of tribe, no diver&s;ity of tongue, can darken or ren|der doubtful. Education, though of migh|ty influence, hath not power to vary or &s;o|phi&s;ticate, far le&s;s to de&s;troy, their &s;ignifica|tion. This is a wi&s;e appointment of Provi|dence. For if the&s;e &s;igns were, like words, arbitrary and variable, it would be an intri|cate &s;cience to decipher the actions and mo|tives of our own &s;pecies, which would prove a great or rather invincible ob&s;truction to the formation of &s;ocieties. But as matters are ordered, the external appearances of joy, grief, anger, fear, &s;hame, and of the other pa&s;&s;ions, forming an univer&s;al lan|guage, open a direct avenue to the heart. As the arbitrary &s;igns vary in every country, there could be no communication of thoughts among different nations, were it not for the
<PB N="128" REF="127">
natural &s;igns in which all agree. Words are &s;ufficient for the communication of &s;ci|ence, and of all mental conceptions: but the di&s;covering pa&s;&s;ions in&s;tantly as they a|ri&s;e, being e&s;&s;ential to our well-being and often nece&s;&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, the au|thor of our nature, attentive to our wants, hath provided a pa&s;&s;age to the heart, which never can be ob&s;tructed while our external &s;en&s;es remain entire.</P>
<P>In an inquiry concerning the external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion, actions ought not altogether to be overlooked: for though &s;ingly they af|ford no clear light, they are upon the whole the be&s;t interpreters of the heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The actions here chiefly in view, are what a pa&s;&s;ion &s;ug|ge&s;ts in order to its gratification. Be&s;ide the&s;e, actions are occa&s;ionally exerted to give &s;ome vent to a pa&s;&s;ion, without propo&s;ing an ultimate gratification. Such occa&s;ional action is characteri&s;tical of the pa&s;&s;ion in a high degree; and for that rea&s;on, when happily invented, has a wonderful good effect in poetry:

<PB N="129" REF="128">
a man's conduct for a cour&s;e of time, we di&s;cover unerringly the various pa&s;&s;ions that move him to action, what he loves and what he hates. In our younger years, eve|ry &s;ingle action is a mark not at all ambigu|ous of the temper; for in childhood there is little or no di&s;gui&s;e. The &s;ubject becomes more intricate in advanced age; but even there, di&s;&s;imulation is &s;eldom carried on for any length of time. And thus the conduct of life is the mo&s;t perfect expre&s;&s;ion of the internal di&s;po&s;ition. It merits not indeed the title of an univer&s;al language; becau&s;e it is not thoroughly under&s;tood but by tho&s;e who either have a penetrating genius or ex|ten&s;ive ob&s;ervation. It is a language, how|ever, which every one can decipher in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and which, joined with the other external &s;igns, affords &s;ufficient means for the direction of our conduct with re|gard to others. If we commit any mi&s;take when &s;uch light is afforded, it never can be the effect of unavoidable ignorance, but of ra&s;hne&s;s or inadvertence.</P>
<P>In reflecting upon the various expre&s;&s;ions of our emotions, voluntary and involuntary,
<PB N="130" REF="129">
we mu&s;t recogni&s;e the anxious care of Na|ture to di&s;cover men to each other. Strong emotions, as above hinted, beget an impa|tience to expre&s;s them externally by &s;peech and other voluntary &s;igns, which cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed without a painful effort. Thus a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion is a common excu&s;e for indecent behaviour or har&s;h words. As to the involuntary &s;igns, the&s;e are altoge|ther unavoidable. No volition or effort can prevent the &s;haking of the limbs or a pale vi&s;age, when one is agitated with a vio|lent fit of terror. The blood flies to the face upon a &s;udden emotion of &s;hame, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition:
<Q><SP>
<L>Vergogna, che'n altrui &s;tampo natura,</L>

<BIBL>Pa&s;tor Fido, act 2. &s;c. 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Emotions indeed properly &s;o called, which are quie&s;cent, produce no remarkable &s;igns externally; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that the more deliberate pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould, becau&s;e the ope|ration of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions is neither &s;udden nor violent. The&s;e however remain not alto|gether
<PB N="131" REF="130">
in the dark. Being more frequent than violent pa&s;&s;ion, the bulk of our actions are directed by them. Actions therefore di&s;play, with &s;ufficient evidence, the more deliberate pa&s;&s;ions, and complete the admi|rable &s;y&s;tem of external &s;igns, by which we become &s;kilful in human nature.</P>
<P>Next in order comes an article of great importance, which is, to examine the effects produced upon a &s;pectator by external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion. None of the&s;e &s;igns are beheld with indifference: they are productive of various emotions tending all of them to ends wi&s;e and good. This curious article makes a capital branch of human nature. It is peculiarly u&s;eful to writers who deal in the pathetic; and with re&s;pect to hi&s;tory|painters, it is altogether indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>When we enter upon this article, we ga|ther from experience, that each pa&s;&s;ion, or cla&s;s of pa&s;&s;ions, hath its peculiar &s;igns; and that the&s;e invariably make certain impre&s;|&s;ions on a &s;pectator. The external &s;igns of joy, for example, produce a chearful emo|tion, the external &s;igns of grief produce pity, and the external &s;igns of rage produce a
<PB N="132" REF="131">
&s;ort of terror even in tho&s;e who are not aim|ed at.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is natural to think, that plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould expre&s;s them&s;elves externally by &s;igns that appear agreeable, and painful pa&s;&s;ions by &s;igns that appear di&s;|agreeable. This conjecture, which Nature &s;ugge&s;ts, is confirmed by experience. Pride &s;eems to be an exception; its external &s;igns being di&s;agreeable, though it be commonly reckoned a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ion. But pride is not an exception; for in reality it is a mix|ed pa&s;&s;ion, partly plea&s;ant partly painful. When a proud man confines his thoughts to him&s;elf, and to his own dignity or import|ance, the pa&s;&s;ion is plea&s;ant, and its exter|nal &s;igns agreeable: but as pride chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in undervaluing or contemning o|thers, it is &s;o far painful, and its external &s;igns di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is laid down above, that an agreeable object produceth always a plea&s;ant emotion, and a di&s;agreeable object one that is painful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 7.</NOTE>. According to this law, the
<PB N="133" REF="132">
external &s;igns of a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ion, being a|greeable, mu&s;t produce in the &s;pectator a plea&s;ant emotion; and the external &s;igns of a painful pa&s;&s;ion, being di&s;agreeable, mu&s;t produce in him a painful emotion.</P>
<P>Fourthly, in the pre&s;ent chapter it is ob|&s;erved, that plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions are, for the mo&s;t part, expre&s;&s;ed externally in one uniform manner; and that only the painful pa&s;&s;ions are di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other by their external expre&s;&s;ions. In the emotions ac|cordingly rai&s;ed by external &s;igns of plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions, there is little variety. They are plea&s;ant or chearful, and we have not words to reach a more particular de&s;cription. But the external &s;igns of painful pa&s;&s;ions produce in the &s;pectator emotions of different kinds: the emotions, for example, rai&s;ed by external &s;igns of grief, of remor&s;e, of anger, of en|vy, of malice, are clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other.</P>
<P>Fifthly, emotions rai&s;ed by the external &s;igns of painful pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;ome of them <HI>attractive,</HI> &s;ome <HI>repul&s;ive.</HI> Every painful
<PB N="134" REF="133">
pa&s;&s;ion that is al&s;o di&s;agreeable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pa&s;&s;ions explained as agreeable or di&s;agreeable, chap. 2. part 2.</NOTE>, rai&s;es by its external &s;igns a repul&s;ive emotion, repel|ling the &s;pectator from the object. Thus the emotions rai&s;ed by external &s;igns of envy and rage, are repul&s;ive. But this is not the ca&s;e of painful pa&s;&s;ions that are agreeable. Their external &s;igns, it is true, are di&s;agree|able, and rai&s;e in the &s;pectator a painful e|motion. But this painful emotion is not re|pul&s;ive. On the contrary, it is attractive; and produceth in the &s;pectator good-will to the man who is moved by the pa&s;&s;ion, and a de&s;ire to relieve or comfort him. This cannot be better exemplified than by di&s;tre&s;s painted on the countenance, which in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly in&s;pires the &s;pectator with pity, and impels him to afford relief. The cau&s;e of this difference among the painful emo|tions rai&s;ed by external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion, may be readily gathered from what is laid down chapter Emotions and pa&s;&s;ions, part 7.</P>
<P>It is now time to look back to the que|&s;tion propo&s;ed in the beginning, How we come to under&s;tand external &s;igns, &s;o as
<PB N="135" REF="134">
readily to a&s;cribe each &s;ign to its proper pa&s;|&s;ion? We have &s;een that this branch of knowledge, cannot be derived originally from &s;ight, nor from experience. Is it then im|planted in us by nature? The following con&s;iderations will help us to an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the affirmative. In the fir&s;t place, the external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be natural; for they are invariably the &s;ame in every country, and among the different tribes of men. Pride, for example, is al|ways expre&s;&s;ed by an erect po&s;ture, reve|rence by pro&s;tration, and &s;orrow by a de|jected look. Secondly, we are not even indebted to experience for the knowledge that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are natural and uni|ver&s;al. We are &s;o framed as to have an innate conviction of the fact. Let a man change his habitation to the other &s;ide of the globe; he will, from the accu&s;tom|ed &s;igns, infer the pa&s;&s;ion of fear among his new neighbours, with as little he&s;itation as he did at home. And upon &s;econd thoughts, the que&s;tion may be an&s;wered without any preliminaries. If the branch of knowledge we have been inquiring about be
<PB N="136" REF="135">
not derived from &s;ight nor from experience, there is no remaining &s;ource from whence it can be derived but from nature.</P>
<P>We may then venture to pronounce, with &s;ome degree of confidence, that man is provided by nature with a &s;en&s;e or facul|ty which lays open to him every pa&s;&s;ion by means of its external expre&s;&s;ions. And I ima|gine that we cannot entertain any rea&s;onable doubt of this fact, when we reflect, that e|ven infants are not ignorant of the mean|ing of external &s;igns. An infant is remark|ably affected with the pa&s;&s;ions of its nur&s;e expre&s;&s;ed on her countenance: a &s;mile chears it, and a frown makes it afraid. Fear thus generated in the infant, mu&s;t, like every other pa&s;&s;ion, have an object. What is the object of this pa&s;&s;ion? Surely not the frown con&s;idered ab&s;tractly, for a child never ab&s;tracts. The nur&s;e who frowns is evidently the object. Fear, at the &s;ame time, cannot ari&s;e but from apprehend|ing danger. But what danger can a child apprehend, if it be not &s;en&s;ible that the per&s;on who frowns is angry? We mu&s;t therefore admit, that a child can read anger
<PB N="137" REF="136">
in its nur&s;e's face; and it mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of this intuitively, for it has no other means of knowledge. I have no occa&s;ion to af|&s;irm, that the&s;e particulars are clearly ap|prehended by the child. To produce clear and di&s;tinct perceptions, reflection and ex|perience are requi&s;ite. But that even an infant, when afraid, mu&s;t have &s;ome no|tion of its being in danger, is extremely e|vident.</P>
<P>That we &s;hould be con&s;cious intuitively of a pa&s;&s;ion from its external expre&s;&s;ions, is conformable to the analogy of nature. The knowledge of this language is of too great importance to be left upon experience. To re&s;t it upon a foundation &s;o uncertain and precarious, would prove a great ob&s;ta|cle to the formation of &s;ocieties. Wi&s;ely therefore is it ordered, and agreeably to the &s;y&s;tem of Providence, that we &s;hould have Nature for our in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>Manifold and admirable are the purpo|&s;es to which the external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion are made &s;ub&s;ervient by the author of our nature. What are occa&s;ionally mentioned
<PB N="138" REF="137">
above, make but a part. Several final cau|&s;es remain to be unfolded; and to this ta&s;k I apply my&s;elf with alacrity. In the fir&s;t place, the &s;igns of internal agitation that are di&s;played externally to every &s;pectator, tend to fix the &s;ignification of many terms. The only effectual means to a&s;certain the meaning of any doubtful word, is an ap|peal to the thing it repre&s;ents. Hence the ambiguity of words expre&s;&s;ive of things that are not objects of external &s;en&s;e; for in that ca&s;e an appeal is denied. Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is not an object of exter|nal &s;en&s;e: but its external &s;igns are; and by means of the&s;e &s;igns, pa&s;&s;ions may be appealed to, with tolerable accuracy. Thus the words that denote our pa&s;&s;ions, next to tho&s;e that denote external objects, have the mo&s;t di&s;tinct meaning. Words &s;ignifying internal action and the more delicate feel|ings, are le&s;s di&s;tinct. This defect with re&s;pect to internal action, is what chiefly occa&s;ions the intricacy of logic. The terms of that &s;cience are far from being &s;ufficient|ly a&s;certained, even after the care and la|bour

The &s;ame defect is remark|able in critici&s;m, which has for its object the more delicate feelings. The terms that denote the&s;e feelings, are not more di&s;tinct than tho&s;e of logic. To reduce this &s;cience of critici&s;m to any regular form, has never once been attempted.

<P>In the &s;econd place, &s;ociety among in|dividuals is greatly promoted by this uni|ver&s;al language. The di&s;tance and re&s;erve that &s;trangers naturally di&s;cover, &s;how its utility.

<P>Thirdly, after &s;ocial intercour&s;e is com|menced, the&s;e external &s;igns contribute a|bove all other means to the &s;tricte&s;t union, by diffu&s;ing through a whole a&s;&s;embly the feelings of each individual. Language no doubt is the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive vehicle for communicating emotions: but in expedi|tion, as well as in the power of conviction, it falls &s;hort of the &s;igns under con&s;idera|tion; the involuntary &s;igns e&s;pecially, which are incapable of deceit. Where the coun|tenance, the tones, the ge&s;tures, the ac|tions, join with the words, in communica|ting emotions, the&s;e united have a force ir|re&s;i&s;tible. Thus all the agreeable emotions of the human heart, with all the &s;ocial and virtuous affections, are, by means of the&s;e external &s;igns, not only perceived but felt. By this admirable contrivance, &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e becomes that lively and animating a|mu&s;ement, without which life would at be&s;t be in&s;ipid.

Fourthly, di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions being hurtful by prompting violence and mi&s;chief, are no|ted by the mo&s;t con&s;picuous external &s;igns, in order to put us upon our guard. Thus anger and revenge, e&s;pecially when &s;udden|ly provoked, di&s;play them&s;elves on the countenance in legible characters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rough and blunt manners, are allied to anger by an in|ternal feeling, as well as by external expre&s;&s;ions re&s;embling in a &s;aint degree tho&s;e of anger.

They are fir&s;t readily converted into anger: and next, the change being imperceptible, becau&s;e of the &s;i|militude of external &s;igns, the per&s;on again&s;t whom the anger is directed is not put upon his guard. It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons a great object in &s;ociety, to correct &s;uch manners, and to bring on a habit of &s;weetne&s;s and calmne&s;s. This temper has two oppo&s;ite good effects.

<P>In the fifth place, the&s;e external &s;igns are made &s;ub&s;ervient in a curious manner to the cau&s;e of virtue. The external &s;igns of a painful pa&s;&s;ion that is virtuous or inno|cent, and con&s;equently agreeable, produce indeed a painful emotion. But this emo|tion is attractive, and connects the &s;pectator with the per&s;on who &s;uffers. Di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ions only, are productive of repul&s;ive e|motions involving the &s;pectator's aver&s;ion, and frequently his indignation.

<PB N="143" REF="142">
which human &s;ociety is indebted for its greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, that of &s;ecuring relief in all ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s. A &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting, ought to be examined with lei&s;ure and at|tention. The conformity of the nature of man to his external circum&s;tances, is in e|very particular wonderful. His nature makes him prone to &s;ociety; and his &s;itua|tion makes it nece&s;&s;ary for him. In a &s;oli|tary &s;tate he is the mo&s;t helple&s;s of beings; de&s;titute of &s;upport, and in his manifold di|&s;tre&s;&s;es de&s;titute of relief. Mutual &s;upport, the &s;hining attribute of &s;ociety, being e&s;&s;en|tial to the well-being of man, is not left up|on rea&s;on, but is inforced even in&s;tinctively by the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy. Here &s;ympathy makes a capital figure; and contributes, more than any other means, to make life ea&s;y and comfortable. But however e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ympathy be to comfortable exi&s;tence, one thinking of it beforehand, would find difficulty in conjecturing how it could be rai&s;ed by external &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s. For con|&s;idering the analogy of nature, if the&s;e &s;igns be agreeable, they mu&s;t give birth to a plea|&s;ant emotion leading every beholder to be
<PB N="144" REF="143">
plea&s;ed with human misfortunes. If they be di&s;agreeable, as they undoubtedly are, ought not the painful emotion they produce to repel the &s;pectator from them, in order to be relieved from pain? Such would be the conjecture, in thinking of this matter be|forehand; and &s;uch would be the effect, were man purely a &s;elfi&s;h being. But the benevolence of our nature gives a very dif|ferent direction to the painful pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy, and to the de&s;ire involved in it. Far from flying from di&s;tre&s;s, we fly to it in order to afford relief; and our &s;ympathy cannot be otherwi&s;e gratified than by giving all the &s;uccour in our power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 7.</NOTE>. Thus ex|ternal &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s, though di&s;agreeable, are attractive; and the &s;ympathy they in|&s;pire us with is a powerful cau&s;e, impelling us to afford relief even to a &s;tranger as if he were our friend or blood-relation.</P>
<P>This branch of human nature concern|ing the external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion, is &s;o fine|ly adju&s;ted to an&s;wer its end, that tho&s;e who under&s;tand it the be&s;t will admire it the
<PB N="145" REF="144">
mo&s;t. The&s;e external &s;igns, being all of them re&s;olvable into colour, figure, and motion, &s;hould not naturally make any deep impre&s;&s;ion on a &s;pectator. And &s;uppo&s;ing them qualified for making deep impre&s;&s;ions, we have &s;een above, that the effects they produce are not what would be expected. We cannot therefore account otherwi&s;e for the operation of the&s;e external &s;igns, than by a&s;cribing it to the original con&s;titution of human nature. To improve the &s;ocial &s;tate, by making us in&s;tinctively rejoice with the glad of heart, weep with the mourner, and &s;hun tho&s;e who threaten danger, is a contri|vance illu&s;trious for its wi&s;dom as well as be|nevolence. With re&s;pect to the external &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s in particular, to judge of the excellency of their contrivance, we need only reflect upon &s;everal other means &s;eem|ingly more natural, that would not have an|&s;wered the end propo&s;ed. I am attracted by this amu&s;ing &s;peculation, and will not a&s;k pardon for indulging in it. We &s;hall in the fir&s;t place rever&s;e the truth, by putting the ca&s;e that the external &s;igns of joy were di&s;|agreeable, and the external &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="146" REF="145">
agreeable. This is no whim&s;ical &s;uppo&s;i|tion; for the&s;e external &s;igns, &s;o far as can be gathered from their nature, &s;eem indif|ferent to the production of plea&s;ure or pain. Admitting then the &s;uppo&s;ition, the que&s;tion is, How would our &s;ympathy operate? There is no occa&s;ion to deliberate for an an|&s;wer. Sympathy, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, would be not le&s;s de&s;tructive, than accor|ding to the real ca&s;e it is beneficial. We &s;hould be incited, to cro&s;s the happine&s;s of others if its external &s;igns were di&s;agreeable to us, and to augment their di&s;tre&s;s if its external &s;igns were agreeable. I make a &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition, That the external &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s were indifferent to us, and pro|ductive neither of plea&s;ure nor pain. This would annihilate the &s;tronge&s;t branch of &s;ympathy, that which is rai&s;ed by means of &s;ight. And it is evident, that reflective &s;ympathy, felt by tho&s;e only who have more than an ordinary &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, would be far from being &s;ufficient to fulfil the ends of the &s;ocial &s;tate. I &s;hall approach nearer truth in a third &s;uppo&s;ition, That the exter|nal &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s being di&s;agreeable, were
<PB N="147" REF="146">
productive of a painful repul&s;ive emotion. Sympathy upon this &s;uppo&s;ition would not be annihilated; but it would be rendered u&s;ele&s;s. For it would be gratified by flying from or avoiding the object, in&s;tead of cling|ing to it, and affording relief. The condi|tion of man would in reality be wor&s;e than if &s;ympathy were totally eradicated; becau&s;e &s;ympathy would only &s;erve to plague tho&s;e who feel it, without producing any good to the afflicted.</P>
<P>Loath to quit &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject, I add a reflection, with which I &s;hall conclude. The external &s;igns of pa&s;&s;ion are a &s;trong in|dication, that man, by his very con&s;titution, is framed to be open and &s;incere. A child, in all things obedient to the impul&s;es of na|ture, hides none of its emotions: the &s;avage and clown, who have no guide other than pure nature, expo&s;e their hearts to view by giving way to all the natural &s;igns: and even when men learn to di&s;&s;emble their &s;enti|ments, and when behaviour degenerates in|to art, there &s;till remain checks, which keep di&s;&s;imulation within bounds, and pre|vent a great part of its mi&s;chievous effects.
<PB N="148" REF="147">
The total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the voluntary &s;igns during any vivid pa&s;&s;ion, begets the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, which cannot be endured for a|ny con&s;iderable time. This operation be|comes indeed le&s;s painful by habit: but luc|kily the involuntary &s;igns, cannot by any ef|fort be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or even di&s;&s;embled. An ab&s;olute hypocri&s;y, by which the character is concealed and a fictitious one a&s;&s;umed, is made impracticable; and nature has there|by prevented much harm to &s;ociety. We may pronounce therefore, that nature, her|&s;elf &s;incere and candid, intends that man|kind &s;hould pre&s;erve the &s;ame character, by cultivating &s;implicity and truth, and bani&s;h|ing every &s;ort of di&s;&s;imulation that tends to mi&s;chief.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. SENTIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thought &s;ugge&s;ted by a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion, is termed <HI>a &s;entiment</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The knowledge of the &s;entiments peculiar to each pa&s;&s;ion con&s;idered ab&s;tract|ly, will not alone enable an arti&s;t to make a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of nature. He ought, over and above, to be acquainted with the various appearances of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in different per&s;ons. Pa&s;&s;ions, it is certain, re|ceive a tincture from every peculiarity of character; and for that rea&s;on, it rarely happens that any two per&s;ons vent their pa&s;|&s;ions preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner. Hence the following rule concerning dramatic and epic compo&s;itions. That a pa&s;&s;ion be adju&s;ted to the character, the &s;entiments to the pa&s;|&s;ion, and the language to the &s;entiments.
<PB N="150" REF="149">
If nature be not faithfully copied in each of the&s;e, a defect in execution is perceived. There may appear &s;ome re&s;emblance; but the picture upon the whole will be in&s;ipid, through want of grace and delicacy. A painter, in order to repre&s;ent the various at|titudes of the body, ought to be intimately acquainted with mu&s;cular motion: not le&s;s intimately acquainted with emotions and cha|racters ought a writer to be, in order to re|pre&s;ent the various attitudes of the mind. A general notion of the pa&s;&s;ions, in their gro&s;&s;er differences of &s;trong and weak, ele|vated and humble, &s;evere and gay, is far from being &s;ufficient. Pictures formed &s;o &s;uperficially, have little re&s;emblance, and no expre&s;&s;ion. And yet it will appear by and by, that in many in&s;tances our reputed ma|&s;ters are deficient even in this &s;uperficial knowledge.</P>
<P>In handling the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it would be endle&s;s to trace even the ordinary pa&s;|&s;ions through their nicer and more minute differences. Mine &s;hall be an humbler ta&s;k; which is, to &s;elect from the be&s;t wri|ters in&s;tances of faulty &s;entiments, after pa|ving
<PB N="151" REF="150">
the way by &s;ome general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>To talk in the language of mu&s;ic, each pa&s;&s;ion hath a certain tone, to which every &s;entiment proceeding from it ought to be tuned with the greate&s;t accuracy. This is no ea&s;y work, e&s;pecially where &s;uch har|mony is to be &s;upported during the cour&s;e of a long theatrical repre&s;entation. In or|der to reach &s;uch delicacy of execution, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a writer a&s;&s;ume the preci&s;e character and pa&s;&s;ion of the per&s;onage re|pre&s;ented. This requires an uncommon genius. But it is the only difficulty; for the writer, who, forgetting him&s;elf, can thus per&s;onate another, &s;o as to feel truly and di&s;tinctly the various agitations of the pa&s;&s;ion, need be in no pain about the &s;en|timents: the&s;e will flow without the lea&s;t &s;tudy, or even preconception; and will fre|quently be as delightfully new to him&s;elf as afterward to his reader. But if a lively pic|ture even of a &s;ingle emotion require an ef|fort of genius; how much greater mu&s;t the effort be, to compo&s;e a pa&s;&s;ionate dialogue, in which there are as many different tones of pa&s;&s;ion as there are &s;peakers? With what
<PB N="152" REF="151">
ductility of feeling ought a writer to be en|dued who aims at perfection in &s;uch a work; when, to execute it correctly, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry to a&s;&s;ume different and even oppo&s;ite characters and pa&s;&s;ions, in the quicke&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion? And yet this work, difficult as it is, yields to that of compo&s;ing a dialogue in genteel comedy devoid of pa&s;&s;ion; where the &s;entiments mu&s;t be tuned to the nicer and more delicate tones of different charac|ters. That the latter is the more difficult ta&s;k, appears from con&s;idering, that a cha|racter is greatly more complex than a pa&s;|&s;ion, and that pa&s;&s;ions are more di&s;tingui&s;h|able from each other than characters are. Many writers accordingly who have no ge|nius for characters, make a &s;hift to repre|&s;ent, tolerably well, an ordinary pa&s;&s;ion in its plain movements. But of all works of this kind, what is truly the mo&s;t difficult, is a characteri&s;tical dialogue upon any philo&s;o|phical &s;ubject. To interweave characters with rea&s;oning, by adapting to the peculiar cha|racter of each &s;peaker a peculiarity not only of thought but of expre&s;&s;ion, requires the perfection of genius, ta&s;te, and judgement.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="152">
How hard dialogue-writing is, will be evident, even without rea&s;oning, from the imperfect compo&s;itions of this kind found without number in all langua|ges. The art of mimicking any &s;ingulari|ty in voice or ge&s;ture, is a rare talent, though directed by &s;ight and hearing, the acute&s;t and mo&s;t lively of our external &s;en|&s;es: how much more rare mu&s;t the talent be of imitating characters and internal e|motions, tracing all their different tints, and repre&s;enting them in a lively manner by natural &s;entiments properly expre&s;&s;ed? The truth is, &s;uch execution is too delicate for an ordinary genius; and for that rea&s;on, the bulk of writers, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing a pa&s;&s;ion like one who is under its power, content them&s;elves with de&s;cribing it like a &s;pectator. To awake pa&s;&s;ion by an inter|nal effort merely, without any external cau&s;e, requires great &s;en&s;ibility; and yet this operation is nece&s;&s;ary not le&s;s to the writer than to the actor; becau&s;e none but they who actually feel a pa&s;&s;ion, can repre|&s;ent it to the life. The writer's part is much more complicated: he mu&s;t join compo&s;i|tion
<PB N="154" REF="153">
with action; and, in the quicke&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, be able to adopt every different character introduced in his work. But a very humble flight of imagination, may &s;erve to convert a writer into a &s;pectator, &s;o as to figure, in &s;ome ob&s;cure manner, an action as pa&s;&s;ing in his &s;ight and hear|ing. In this figured &s;ituation, he is led naturally to de&s;cribe as a &s;pectator, and at &s;econd hand to entertain his readers with his own ob&s;ervations, with cool de&s;cription and florid declamation; in&s;tead of making them eye-witne&s;&s;es, as it were, to a real e|vent, and to every movement of genuine pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> the hero is made to de&s;cribe him&s;elf in the following words: <HI>Sum pius Aeneas, fama &s;uper aethera notus.</HI> Virgil could never have been guilty of an impropriety &s;o gro&s;s, had he a&s;&s;umed the per&s;onage of his hero, in&s;tead of uttering the &s;entiments of a &s;pectator.

It is this im|perfection, I am per&s;uaded, in the bulk of our plays, that confines our &s;tage almo&s;t entirely to Shake&s;pear, his many irregula|rities notwith&s;tanding.

&s;earch in any of them for a &s;entiment ex|pre&s;&s;ive of character; and, upon that very account, all our modern performances of the dramatic kind, are intolerably in&s;ipid.</P>

The &s;entiments here di&s;play'd flow &s;o na|turally from the pa&s;&s;ions repre&s;ented, and are &s;uch genuine expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to conceive any imitation more perfect.</P>
<P>With regard to the French author, truth obliges me to acknowledge, that he de|&s;cribes in the &s;tyle of a &s;pectator, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion like one who feels it; and al&s;o that he is thereby betray'd into the other faults above mentioned, a tire|&s;ome monotony, and a pompous declama|tory &s;tyle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This critici&s;m reaches the French dramatic writers in general, with very few exceptions. Their tragedies are mo&s;tly, if not totally, de&s;criptive. Corneille led the way; and later writers following his track, have accu&s;tomed the French ear to a &s;tyle, formal, pompous, declamatory, which &s;uits not with any pa&s;&s;ion. Hence it becomes an ea&s;y ta&s;k to burle&s;k a French tragedy: it is not more difficult than to bur|le&s;k a &s;tiff &s;olemn fop. The facility of the operation has in Paris introduced a &s;ingular amu&s;ement, which is, to burle&s;k the more &s;ucce&s;sful tragedies in a &s;ort of farce, called <HI>a pa|rody.</HI> La Motte, who him&s;elf appears to have been &s;orely galled by &s;ome of the&s;e burle&s;k compo&s;itions, acknowledges, that no more is nece&s;&s;ary to give them a run, than barely to vary the <HI>dramatis per&s;onae,</HI> and in place of kings and heroes, queens and prince&s;&s;es, to &s;ub&s;titute tinkers and tailors, milk-maids and &s;eam&s;tre&s;&s;es. The declamatory &s;tyle, &s;o different from the genuine expre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion, pa&s;&s;es in &s;ome mea&s;ure unob&s;erved, when great per&s;onages are the &s;peakers. But in the mouths of the vulgar, the impropriety, with regard to the &s;peaker as well as to the pa&s;&s;ion repre&s;ented, is &s;o remarkable as to become ridiculous. A tragedy, where every pa&s;&s;ion is made to &s;peak in its natural tone, is not liable to be thus burle&s;ked. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion is by all men expre&s;&s;ed nearly in the &s;ame manner: and therefore the genuine expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion cannot be ridiculous in the mouth of any man, provided only he be of &s;uch a character as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of the pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is a well-known fact, that to an Engli&s;h ear the French actors appear to pronounce with too great rapidity; a complaint much in&s;i&s;ted on by Cibber in particular, who had frequently heard the famous Baron upon the French &s;tage. This may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be attributed to our want of facility in the French language; as foreigners generally imagine, that every language is pronounced too quick by natives. But that it is not the &s;ole cau&s;e, will be probable from a fact directly oppo|&s;ite, that the French are not a little di&s;gu&s;ted with the lan|guidne&s;s, as they term it, of the Engli&s;h pronunciation. I conjecture this difference of ta&s;te may be derived from what is ob&s;erved above. The pronunciation of the genuine lan|guage of pa&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;arily directed by the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion, and by the &s;lowne&s;s or celerity of its progre&s;s. In par|ticular, plaintive pa&s;&s;ions, which are the mo&s;t frequent in tra|gedy, having a &s;low motion, dictate a &s;low pronunciation. In declamation again, which is not the genuine language of any pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;peaker warms gradually; and as he warms, he naturally accelerates his pronunciation. But as the French have formed their tone of pronunciation upon Corneille's decla|matory tragedies, and the Engli&s;h upon the more natural lan|guage of Shake&s;pear, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that cu&s;tom &s;hould produce &s;uch difference of ta&s;te in the two nations.</P></NOTE>. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce

particular in&s;tances; for he never va|ries from this tone. I &s;hall however take two pa&s;&s;ages at a venture, in order to be
<PB N="161" REF="160">
confronted with tho&s;e tran&s;cribed above. In the tragedy of <HI>Cinna,</HI> Aemilia, after the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered, having nothing in view but racks and death to her&s;elf and her lover, receives a pardon from Augu&s;tus, attended with the brighte&s;t circum&s;tances of magnanimity and tender|ne&s;s. This is a happy &s;ituation for repre|&s;enting the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e and gratitude in their different &s;tages. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, rai&s;ed at once to the utmo&s;t pitch, are at fir&s;t too big for utterance; and Aemilia's feelings mu&s;t, for &s;ome moments, have been expre&s;&s;ed by violent ge&s;tures only. So &s;oon as there is a vent for words, the
<PB N="162" REF="161">
fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ions are naturally broken and interrupted. At la&s;t we ought to expect a tide of intermingled &s;entiments, occa&s;ioned by the fluctuation of the mind betwixt the two pa&s;&s;ions. Aemilia is made to behave in a very different manner. With extreme coolne&s;s &s;he de&s;cribes her own &s;ituation, as if &s;he were merely a &s;pectator; or rather the poet takes the ta&s;k off her hands.

<P>And this leads to a &s;econd ob&s;ervation, That the different &s;tages of a pa&s;&s;ion, and its different directions, from its birth to its extinction, ought to be carefully re|pre&s;ented in the &s;entiments, which other|wi&s;e will often be mi&s;placed. Re&s;entment, for example, when provoked by an atro|cious injury, di&s;charges it&s;elf fir&s;t upon the
<PB N="166" REF="165">
author. Sentiments therefore of revenge take place of all others, and mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure be exhau&s;ted before the per&s;on injured think of pitying him&s;elf, or of grie|ving for his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. In the <HI>Cid</HI> of Corneille, Don Diegue having been affront|ed in a cruel manner, expre&s;&s;es &s;carce any &s;entiment of revenge, but is totally occu|pied in contemplating the low &s;ituation to which he was reduced by the affront.

The&s;e &s;entiments are certainly not what oc|cur to the mind in the fir&s;t movements of the pa&s;&s;ion. In the &s;ame manner as in re|&s;entment, the fir&s;t movements of grief are always directed upon its object. Yet with relation to the &s;udden and &s;evere di&s;temper that &s;eized Alexander bathing in the ri|ver Cydnus, Quintus Curtius de&s;cribes the fir&s;t emotions of the army as directed upon them&s;elves, lamenting that they were left without a leader far from home, and had &s;carce any hopes of returning in &s;afety. Their King's di&s;tre&s;s, which mu&s;t naturally have been their fir&s;t concern, occupies them but in the &s;econd place according to that author. In the <HI>Aminta</HI> of Ta&s;&s;o, Sylvia, upon a report of her lover's death, which &s;he believed certain, in&s;tead of bemoaning the lo&s;s of a beloved object, turns her

Guilt mu&s;t not appear in its native colours, even in thought: the pro|po&s;al mu&s;t be made by hints, and by repre|&s;enting the action in &s;ome favourable light. Of the propriety of &s;entiment upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, Shake&s;pear, in the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> has given us a beautiful example.

<P>As things are be&s;t illu&s;trated by their contraries, I proceed to collect from cla&s;&s;i|cal authors, &s;entiments that appear faulty. The fir&s;t cla&s;s &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of &s;entiments that

Thoughts that properly are not &s;entiments, but rather de&s;criptions, make a third. Sentiments that belong to the pa&s;|&s;ion repre&s;ented, but are faulty as being introduced too early or too late, make a fourth. Vicious &s;entiments expo&s;ed in their native dre&s;s, in&s;tead of being concealed or di&s;gui&s;ed, make a fifth.

In <HI>Les Freres ennemies</HI> of Racine, the &s;econd act is opened with a love-&s;cene. Hemon talks to his mi&s;tre&s;s of the torments of ab|&s;ence, of the lu&s;tre of her eyes, that he ought to die no where but at her feet, and that one moment of ab&s;ence was a thou&s;and years. Antigone on her part acts the coquette, and pretends &s;he mu&s;t be gone to wait on her mother and brother, and cannot &s;tay to li|&s;ten to his court&s;hip. This is odious French gallantry, below the dignity of the pa&s;&s;ion of love. It would &s;carce be excu&s;able in painting modern French manners; and is in&s;ufferable where the ancients are brought upon the &s;tage. The manners painted in the <HI>Alexandre</HI> of the &s;ame author are not more ju&s;t. French gallantry prevails there throughout.</P>
<P>Third. Sentiments that agree not with the tone of the pa&s;&s;ion; as where a plea&s;ant &s;en|timent

What other are the foregoing in&s;tances than de&s;cribing the pa&s;&s;ion another feels?</P>
<P>An example is given above of remor&s;e and de&s;pair expre&s;&s;ed by genuine and natu|ral &s;entiments. In the fourth book of <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> Satan is made to expre&s;s his re|mor&s;e and de&s;pair in &s;entiments, which though beautiful, are not altogether na|tural.

<L>Under my battlements. Come all you &s;pirits</L>

</SP>
<BIBL>Macbeth, act 1. &s;c. 7.</BIBL></Q>
This &s;peech is not natural. Murder under tru&s;t was never perpetrated even by the mo&s;t hardened mi&s;creant without compunc|tion. And that the lady here mu&s;t have been in horrible agitation appears, from her invoking the infernal &s;pirits to fill her with cruelty, and to &s;top up all avenues to re|mor&s;e. But in this &s;tate of mind, it is a ne|ver-failing device of &s;elf-deceit, to draw the thicke&s;t veil over the wicked action, and to extenuate it by all circum&s;tances that ima|gination
<PB N="191" REF="190">
can &s;ugge&s;t. And if the crime cannot bear di&s;gui&s;e, the next attempt is, to thru&s;t it out of mind altogether, and to ru&s;h on to action without thought. This la&s;t was the hu&s;band's method.

The lady follows neither of the&s;e cour&s;es, but in a deliberate manner endeavours to fortify her heart in the commi&s;&s;ion of an ex|ecrable crime, without even attempting a di&s;gui&s;e.

Bad fortune and inju&s;tice affect every one greatly; and of the&s;e we are &s;o prone to complain, that if we have no friend or acquaintance to take part in our &s;ufferings, we &s;ometimes utter our complaints aloud even where there are none to li&s;ten.</P>
<P>But this propen&s;ity, though natural, ope|rates not in every &s;tate of mind. A man immoderately grieved, &s;eeks to afflict him|&s;elf; and &s;elf-affliction is the gratification of the pa&s;&s;ion. Immoderate grief is therefore mute; becau&s;e complaining is &s;truggling for relief:
<Q><SP>
<L>It is the wretch's comfort &s;till to have</L>
<L><PB N="205" REF="204">
Some &s;mall re&s;erve of near and inward wo,</L>
<L>Some un&s;u&s;pected hoard of inward grief,</L>
<L>Which they un&s;een may wail, and weep, and mourn,</L>
<L>And glutton-like alone devour.</L>

When grief &s;ub&s;ides, it then and no &s;ooner finds a tongue. We complain, becau&s;e complaining is an effort to di&s;burden the mind of its di&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This ob&s;ervation is finely illu&s;trated by a &s;tory which Herodotus records, <HI>book</HI> 3. Camby&s;es when he conquered Egypt, took P&s;ammenitus the King pri&s;oner: and to try his con&s;tancy, ordered his daughter to be dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a &s;lave, and to be employ'd in bringing water from the river. His &s;on al&s;o was led to execution with a halter about his neck. The Egyptians vented their &s;orrow in tears and lamentations. P&s;ammenitus only, with a down-ca&s;t eye, remained &s;ilent. Afterward meeting one of his companions, a man advanced in years, who being plundered of all, was begging alms, he wept bitterly, calling him by his name. Camby&s;es was &s;truck with wonder, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger with the following que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"P&s;ammenitus, thy ma&s;ter Camby&s;es is de&s;irous to know, why, after thou had&s;t &s;een thy daughter &s;o ignominiou&s;ly treat|ed, and thy &s;on led to execution, without exclamation or weeping, thou &s;hould&s;t be &s;o highly concerned for a poor man no way related to thee?"</Q> P&s;ammenitus returned the following an&s;wer:  <Q REND="inline">"Son of Cyrus, the calamities of my fa|mily are too great to leave me the power of weeping: but the misfortunes of a companion, reduced in his old age to want of bread, is a fit &s;ubject for lamentation."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e and terror are &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ions for a different rea&s;on: they agitate the mind &s;o violently, as for a time to &s;u&s;pend the ex|erci&s;e of its faculties, and in particular that of &s;peech.</P>
<P>Love and revenge, when immoderate,
<PB N="206" REF="205">
are not more loquacious than immoderate grief. But when the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions become moderate, they &s;et the tongue free, and, like moderate grief, become loquacious. Mo|derate love, when un&s;ucce&s;sful, is vented in complaints; when &s;ucce&s;sful, is full of joy expre&s;&s;ed both in words and ge&s;tures.</P>
<P>As no pa&s;&s;ion hath any long uninterrupted exi&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 3.</NOTE> nor beats always with an equal pul&s;e, the language &s;ugge&s;ted by pa&s;&s;ion is al&s;o unequal and interrupted. And even du|ring an uninterrupted fit of pa&s;&s;ion, we only expre&s;s in words the more capital &s;entiments. In familiar conver&s;ation, one who vents every &s;ingle thought is ju&s;tly branded with
<PB N="207" REF="206">
the character of <HI>loquacity.</HI> Sen&s;ible per&s;ons expre&s;s no thoughts but what make &s;ome figure. In the &s;ame manner, we are only di&s;po&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;tronge&s;t impul&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially when it returns with im|petuo&s;ity after &s;ome interruption.</P>
<P>I already have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 16.</NOTE>, that the &s;entiments ought to be tuned to the pa&s;&s;ion, and the language to both. E|levated &s;entiments require elevated language: tender &s;entiments ought to be clothed in words that are &s;oft and flowing: when the mind is depre&s;&s;ed with any pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;en|timents mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed in words that are humble, not low. Words have an intimate connection with the ideas they repre&s;ent; and the repre&s;entation mu&s;t be imperfect, if the words corre&s;pond not preci&s;ely to the ideas. An elevated tone of language to ex|pre&s;s a plain or humble &s;entiment, has a bad effect by a di&s;cordant mixture of feeling. There is not le&s;s di&s;cord when elevated &s;en|timents are dre&s;&s;ed in low words:
<Q><PB N="208" REF="207">
<L>Ver&s;ibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult.</L>
<L>Indignatur item privatis ac prope Socco</L>
<L>Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thye&s;tae.</L>
<BIBL>Horace, Ars poet. l. 89.</BIBL></Q>
This however excludes not figurative ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which, within moderate bounds, communicates to the &s;entiment an agree|able elevation. We are &s;en&s;ible of an effect directly oppo&s;ite, where figurative expre&s;|&s;ion is indulged beyond a ju&s;t mea&s;ure. The oppo&s;ition betwixt the expre&s;&s;ion and the &s;entiment, makes the di&s;cord appear greater than it is in reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this explained more particularly in chap. 8.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, all pa&s;&s;ions admit not equally of figures. Plea&s;ant emotions, which elevate or &s;well the mind, vent them&s;elves in &s;trong epithets and figurative expre&s;&s;ion. Humbling and di&s;piriting pa&s;|&s;ions, on the contrary, affect to &s;peak plain:
<Q><L>Et tragicus plerumque dolet &s;ermone pede&s;tri</L>
<L>Telephus et Peleus: cum pauper et exul uterque;</L>
<L>Projicit ampullas et &s;e&s;quipedalia verba,</L>

<PB N="209" REF="208">
Figurative expre&s;&s;ion is the work of an en|livened imagination, and for that rea&s;on cannot be the language of angui&s;h or di&s;tre&s;s. A &s;cene of this kind is painted by Otway in colours finely adapted to the &s;ubject. There is &s;carce a figure in it, except a &s;hort and natural &s;imile with which the &s;peech is in|troduced.</P>

<P>To pre&s;erve this re&s;emblance betwixt words and their meaning, the &s;entiments of active and hurrying pa&s;&s;ions ought to be dre&s;&s;ed in words where &s;yllables prevail that are pronounced &s;hort or fa&s;t; for the&s;e make an impre&s;&s;ion of hurry and precipitation. Emotions, on the other hand, that re&s;t upon their objects, are be&s;t expre&s;&s;ed by words where &s;yllables prevail that are pronounced long or &s;low. A per&s;on affected with me|lancholy has a languid and &s;low train of per|ceptions. The expre&s;&s;ion be&s;t &s;uited to this &s;tate of mind, is where words not only of long but of many &s;yllables abound in the compo&s;ition. For that rea&s;on, nothing can be finer than the following pa&s;&s;age:
<Q><L>In tho&s;e deep &s;olitudes, and awful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly-pen&s;ive Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-mu&s;ing Melancholy reigns.</L>
<BIBL>Pope, Eloi&s;a to Abelard.</BIBL></Q>
To pre&s;erve the &s;ame re&s;emblance, another
<PB N="211" REF="210">
circum&s;tance is requi&s;ite, that the language conformable to the emotion, be rough or &s;mooth, broken or uniform. Calm and &s;weet emotions are be&s;t expre&s;&s;ed by words that glide &s;oftly; &s;urpri&s;e, fear, and other turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, require an expre&s;&s;ion both rough and broken.</P>
<P>It cannot have e&s;caped any diligent inqui|rer into nature, that in the hurry of pa&s;&s;ion, one generally expre&s;&s;es that thing fir&s;t which is mo&s;t at heart. This is beautifully done in the following pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P>Pa&s;&s;ion has often the effect of redoubling words, the better to make them expre&s;s the &s;trong conception of the mind. This is finely repre&s;ented in the following exam|ples:

<L>And thou enlighten'd earth, &s;o fre&s;h and gay!</L>

<P>Shake&s;pear is &s;uperior to all other writers in delineating pa&s;&s;ion. It is difficult to &s;ay in what part he mo&s;t excels, whether in moulding every pa&s;&s;ion to peculiarity of character, in di&s;covering the &s;entiments that proceed from various tones of pa&s;&s;ion, or in expre&s;&s;ing properly every different &s;entiment. He impo&s;es not upon his reader, general de|clamation and the fal&s;e coin of unmeaning words, which the bulk of writers deal in. His &s;entiments are adju&s;ted, with the great|e&s;t propriety, to the peculiar character and circum&s;tances of the &s;peaker; and the pro|priety is not le&s;s perfect betwixt his &s;enti|ments and his diction. That this is no ex|aggeration,
<PB N="213" REF="212">
will be evident to every one of ta&s;te, upon comparing Shake&s;pear with o|ther writers, in &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages. If upon a|ny occa&s;ion he fall below him&s;elf, it is in tho&s;e &s;cenes where pa&s;&s;ion enters not. By endeavouring in this ca&s;e to rai&s;e his dialogue above the &s;tyle of ordinary conver&s;ation, he &s;ometimes deviates into intricate thought and ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this take the following &s;pecimen:

<BIBL>Hamlet, act 1. &s;c. 7.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Sometimes, to
<PB N="214" REF="213">
throw his language out of the familiar, he employs rhyme. But may it not in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;e Shake&s;pear, I &s;hall not &s;ay his works, that he had no pattern, in his own or in any living language, of dialogue fitted for the theatre? At the &s;ame time, it ought not to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that the &s;tream clears in its progre&s;s, and that in his later plays he has attained the purity and perfection of dialogue; an ob&s;ervation that, with greater certainty than tradition, will direct us to arrange his plays in the order of time. This ought to be con&s;idered by tho&s;e who magnify every blemi&s;h that is di&s;cover|ed in the fine&s;t genius for the drama ever the world enjoy'd. They ought al&s;o for their own &s;ake to con&s;ider, that it is ea&s;ier to di&s;cover his blemi&s;hes, which lie general|ly at the &s;urface, than his beauties, of which none can have a thorough reli&s;h but tho&s;e who dive deep into human nature. One thing mu&s;t be evident to the meane&s;t capa|city, that where-ever pa&s;&s;ion is to be di&s;|play'd, Nature &s;hows it&s;elf &s;trong in him,
<PB N="215" REF="214">
and is con&s;picuous by the mo&s;t delicate pro|priety of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The critics &s;eem not perfectly to comprehend the genius of Shake&s;pear. His plays are defective in the mechanical part, which is le&s;s the work of genius than of experience; and is not otherwi&s;e brought to perfection than by diligently ob&s;erving the errors of former compo&s;itions. Shake&s;pear ex|cels all the ancients and moderns, in knowledge of human nature, and in unfolding even the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and refined emotions. This is a rare faculty, and of the greate&s;t import|ance in a dramatic author; and it is this faculty which makes him &s;urpa&s;s all other writers in the comic as well as tragic vein.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I return to my &s;ubject from a digre&s;&s;ion I cannot repent of. That perfect harmony which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t among all the con|&s;tituent parts of a dialogue, is a beauty, not le&s;s rare than con&s;picuous. As to expre&s;|&s;ion in particular, were I to give in&s;tances, where, in one or other of the re&s;pects above mentioned, it corre&s;ponds not preci&s;ely to the characters, pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;entiments, I might from different authors collect vo|lumes. Following therefore the method laid down in the chapter of &s;entiments, I &s;hall confine my citations to the gro&s;&s;er er|rors, which every writer ought to avoid.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="215">
And, fir&s;t, of pa&s;&s;ion expre&s;&s;ed in words flowing in an equal cour&s;e without inter|ruption.</P>
<P>In the chapter above cited, Corneille is cen|&s;ured for the impropriety of his &s;entiments; and here, for the &s;ake of truth, I am obli|ged to attack him a &s;econd time. Were I to give in&s;tances from that author of the fault under con&s;ideration, I might co|py whole tragedies; for he is not le&s;s faulty in this particular, than in pa&s;&s;ing up|on us his own thoughts as a &s;pectator, in|&s;tead of the genuine &s;entiments of pa&s;&s;ion. Nor would a compari&s;on betwixt him and Shake&s;pear upon the pre&s;ent point, re|dound more to his honour, than the for|mer upon the &s;entiments. Racine here is le&s;s incorrect than Corneille, though many degrees inferior to the Engli&s;h author. From Racine I &s;hall gather a few in&s;tan|ces. The fir&s;t &s;hall be the de&s;cription of the &s;ea-mon&s;ter in his <HI>Phaedra,</HI> given by Theramene the companion of Hippolytus, and an eye-witne&s;s to the di&s;a&s;ter. The|ramene is repre&s;ented in terrible agitation, which appears from the following pa&s;&s;age,

&s;o boldly figurative as not to be excu&s;ed but by violent perturbation of mind.

The&s;e &s;oliloquies are accurate copies of na|ture. In a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;oliloquy one begins
<PB N="221" REF="220">
with thinking aloud; and the &s;tronge&s;t feelings only, are expre&s;&s;ed. As the &s;peaker warms, he begins to imagine one li&s;tening, and gradually &s;lides into a connected di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>How far di&s;tant are &s;oliloquies generally from the&s;e models? They are indeed for the mo&s;t part &s;o unhappily executed, as to give di&s;gu&s;t in&s;tead of plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t &s;cene of <HI>Iphigenia</HI> in Tauris di&s;covers that prince&s;s, in a &s;oliloquy, gravely reporting to her&s;elf her own hi&s;tory. There is the &s;ame impropriety in the fir&s;t &s;cene of Alce&s;tes, and in the other introductions of Euripides, almo&s;t without exception. Nothing can be more ridiculous. It puts one in mind of that ingenious device in Gothic paint|ings, of making every figure explain it&s;elf by a written label i&s;&s;uing from its mouth. The de&s;cription a para&s;ite, in the <HI>Eunuch</HI> of Terence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 2. &s;c. 2.</NOTE>, gives of him&s;elf in the form of a &s;oliloquy, is lively; but again&s;t all the rules of propriety; for no man, in his or|dinary &s;tate of mind, and upon a familiar
<PB N="222" REF="221">
&s;ubject, ever thinks of talking aloud to him&s;elf. The &s;ame objection lies again&s;t a &s;oliloquy in the <HI>Adelphi</HI> of the &s;ame au|thor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 1. &s;c. 1.</NOTE>. The &s;oliloquy which makes the third &s;cene, act third, of his <HI>Heicyra,</HI> is in|&s;ufferable; for there Pamphilus, &s;oberly and circum&s;tantially, relates to him&s;elf an adventure which had happened to him a moment before.</P>
<P>Corneille is not more happy in his &s;olilo|quies than in his dialogue. Take for a &s;pe|cimen the fir&s;t &s;cene of <HI>Cinna.</HI></P>
<P>Racine al&s;o is extremely faulty in the &s;ame re&s;pect. His &s;oliloquies, almo&s;t without exception, are regular harangues, a chain completed in every link, without interrup|tion or interval. That of Antiochus in <HI>Be|renice</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 1. &s;c. 2.</NOTE> re&s;embles a regular pleading, where the parties <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> di&s;play their argu|ments at full length. The following &s;oli|loquies are equally de&s;titute of propriety: <HI>Bajazet,</HI> act 3. &s;c. 7. <HI>Mithridate,</HI> act 3. &s;c. 4. &amp; act 4. &s;c. 5. <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> act 4. &s;c. 8.</P>
<P>Soliloquies upon lively or intere&s;ting &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="223" REF="222">
but without any turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion, may be carried on in a continued chain of thought. If, for example, the nature and &s;prightline&s;s of the &s;ubject prompt a man to &s;peak his thoughts in the form of a dialogue, the expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be carried on without break or interruption, as in a dialogue be|twixt two per&s;ons. This ju&s;tifies Fal&s;taff's &s;oliloquy upon honour:
<Q><SP>
<P>What need I be &s;o forward with Death, that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, Honour pricks me on. But how if Honour prick me off, when I come on? how then? Can Honour &s;et a leg? No: or an arm? No: or take away the grief of a wound? No: Honour hath no &s;kill in &s;urgery then? No. What is Honour? A word.&mdash;What is that word <HI>honour?</HI> Air; a trim reckoning.&mdash;Who hath it? He that dy'd a Wedne&s;day. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. Is it in&s;en&s;ible then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No: Why? Detraction will not &s;uffer it. Therefore, I'll none of it; honour is a mere &s;cutcheon; and &s;o ends my catechi&s;m.</P>

And even without dialogue, a continued di&s;cour&s;e may be ju&s;tified, where the &s;olilo|quy
<PB N="224" REF="223">
is upon an important &s;ubject that makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, but without much agita|tion. For if it be at all excu&s;able to think a|loud, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the language with the rea&s;oning be carried on in a chain without a broken link. In this view that admirable &s;oliloquy in <HI>Hamlet</HI> upon life and immorta|lity, being a &s;erene meditation upon the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of all &s;ubjects, ought to e|&s;cape cen&s;ure.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Beauty of Language.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the fine arts, painting only and &s;culpture are in their nature imita|tive. A field laid out with ta&s;te, is not, properly &s;peaking, a copy or imita|tion of nature, but nature it&s;elf embelli&s;hed. Architecture deals in originals, and copies not from nature. Sound and motion may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be imitated by mu&s;ic; but for the mo&s;t part mu&s;ic, like architecture, deals in originals. Language has no archetype in nature, more than mu&s;ic or architecture; unle&s;s where, like mu|&s;ic, it is imitative of &s;ound or motion. In the de&s;cription of particular &s;ounds, lan|guage &s;ometimes happily furni&s;heth words, which, be&s;ide their cu&s;tomary power of ex|citing ideas, re&s;emble by their &s;oftne&s;s or har&s;hne&s;s the &s;ound de&s;cribed: and there are words, which, by the celerity or &s;low|ne&s;s of pronunciation, have &s;ome re&s;emblance
<PB N="235" REF="234">
to the motion they &s;ignify. This imitative power of words goes one &s;tep farther. The loftine&s;s of &s;ome words, makes them pro|per &s;ymbols of lofty ideas: a rough &s;ub|ject is imitated by har&s;h-&s;ounding words; and words of many &s;yllables pronounced &s;low and &s;mooth, are naturally expre&s;&s;ive of grief and melancholy. Words have a &s;epa|rate effect on the mind, ab&s;tracting from their &s;ignification and from their imitative power. They are more or le&s;s agreeable to the ear, by the roundne&s;s, &s;weetne&s;s, faint|ne&s;s, or roughne&s;s, of their tones.</P>
<P>The&s;e are beauties, but not of the fir&s;t rank: They are reli&s;hed by tho&s;e only, who have more delicacy of &s;en&s;ation than be|longs to the bulk of mankind. Language po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a beauty &s;uperior greatly in de|gree, of which we are eminently con&s;cious when a thought is communicated in a &s;trong and lively manner. This beauty of lan|guage, ari&s;ing from its power of expre&s;&s;ing thought, is apt to be confounded with the beauty of the thought expre&s;&s;ed; which beauty, by a natural tran&s;ition of feeling a|mong things intimately connected, is con|vey'd
<PB N="236" REF="235">
to the expre&s;&s;ion, and makes it ap|pear more beautiful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>. But the&s;e beauties, if we wi&s;h to think accurately, mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. They are indeed &s;o di&s;tinct, that we &s;ome|times are con&s;cious of the highe&s;t plea&s;ure language can afford, when the &s;ubject ex|pre&s;&s;ed is di&s;agreeable. A thing that is loath&s;ome, or a &s;cene of horror to make one's hair &s;tand on end, may be de&s;cribed in the livelie&s;t manner. In this ca&s;e, the di&s;agree|ablene&s;s of the &s;ubject, doth not even ob|&s;cure the agreeablene&s;s of the de&s;cription. The cau&s;es of the original beauty of lan|guage con&s;idered as &s;ignificant, which is a branch of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, will be explain|ed in their order. I &s;hall only at pre&s;ent ob&s;erve, that this beauty is the beauty of means fitted to an end, <HI>viz.</HI> the communi|cation of thought. And hence it evidently appears, that of &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions all con|veying the &s;ame thought, the mo&s;t beauti|ful, in the &s;en&s;e now mentioned, is that
<PB N="237" REF="236">
which in the mo&s;t perfect manner an&s;wers its end.</P>
<P>The &s;everal beauties of language above mentioned, being of different kinds and di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other, ought to be handled &s;eparately. I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e beauties of language which ari&s;e from &s;ound; after which will follow the beauties of language con&s;idered as &s;ignificant. This or|der appears natural; for the &s;ound of a word is attended to, before we con&s;ider its &s;ignifica|tion. In a third &s;ection come tho&s;e &s;ingular beauties of language that are derived from a re&s;emblance betwixt &s;ound and &s;ignification. The beauties of ver&s;e I propo&s;e to handle in the la&s;t &s;ection. For though the foregoing beauties are found in ver&s;e as well as in pro&s;e; yet ver&s;e has many peculiar beauties, which for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity mu&s;t be brought under one view. And ver&s;ification, at any rate, is a &s;ubject of &s;o great import|ance, as to de&s;erve a place by it&s;elf.</P>

<P>I Propo&s;e to handle this &s;ubject in the fol|lowing order, which appears the mo&s;t natural. The &s;ounds of the different letters come fir&s;t. Next, the&s;e &s;ounds as united in &s;yllables.

Probably tho&s;e vowels which are farthe&s;t removed from the ex|tremes, will generally be the mo&s;t reli&s;hed. This is all I have to remark upon the fir&s;t article. For con&s;onants being letters which of them&s;elves have no &s;ound, have no other power but to form articulate &s;ounds in con|junction with vowels; and every &s;uch arti|culate &s;ound being a &s;yllable, con&s;onants come naturally under the &s;econd article. To which therefore we proceed.</P>
<P>All con&s;onants are pronounced with a le&s;s cavity than any of the vowels; and con|&s;equently they contribute to form a &s;ound &s;till more &s;harp than the &s;harpe&s;t vowel pronounced &s;ingle. Hence it follows, that
<PB N="240" REF="239">
every articulate &s;ound into which a con&s;onant enters, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be double, though pronounced with one expiration of air, or with one breath as commonly expre&s;&s;ed. The rea&s;on is, that though two &s;ounds readily unite; yet where they differ in tone, both of them mu&s;t be heard if neither of them be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, every &s;yllable mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of as many &s;ounds as there are letters, &s;uppo&s;ing every letter to be di&s;tinctly pronounced.</P>
<P>We next inquire, how far articulate &s;ounds into which con&s;onants enter, are agreeable to the ear. With re&s;pect to this point, there is a noted ob&s;ervation, that all &s;ounds of dif|ficult pronunciation are to the ear har&s;h in proportion. Few tongues are &s;o poli&s;hed as entirely to have rejected &s;ounds that are pronounced with difficulty; and &s;uch &s;ounds mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure be di&s;agreeable. But with re&s;pect to agreeable &s;ounds, it appears, that a double &s;ound is always more agree|able than a &s;ingle &s;ound. Every one who has an ear mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the diph|thongs <HI>oi</HI> or <HI>ai</HI> are more agreeable than any of the&s;e vowels pronounced &s;ingly.
<PB N="241" REF="240">
And the &s;ame holds where a con&s;onant en|ters into the double &s;ound. The &s;ylla|ble <HI>le</HI> has a more agreeable &s;ound than the vowel <HI>e</HI> or than any vowel. And in &s;upport of experience, a &s;atisfactory argu|ment may be drawn from the wi&s;dom of Providence. Speech is be&s;towed upon man, to qualify him for &s;ociety. The provi&s;ion he hath of articulate &s;ounds, is proportioned to the u&s;e he hath for them. But if &s;ounds that are agreeable &s;ingly were not al&s;o agree|able in conjunction, the nece&s;&s;ity of a pain|ful &s;election would render language intricate and difficult to be attained in any perfection. And this &s;election, at the &s;ame time, would tend to abridge the number of u&s;eful &s;ounds, &s;o as perhaps not to leave &s;ufficient for an|&s;wering the different ends of language.</P>
<P>In this view, the harmony of pronuncia|tion differs widely from that of mu&s;ic pro|perly &s;o called. In the latter are di&s;covered many &s;ounds &s;ingly agreeable, that in con|junction are extremely di&s;agreeable; none but what are called <HI>concordant &s;ounds</HI> having a good effect in conjunction. In the for|mer, all &s;ounds &s;ingly agreeable are in con|junction
<PB N="242" REF="241">
concordant; and ought to be, in order to fulfil the purpo&s;es of language.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;yllables, we proceed to words; which make a third article. Mo|no&s;yllables belong to the former head. Po|ly&s;yllables open a different &s;cene. In a cur|&s;ory view, one will readily imagine, that the effect a word hath upon the ear, mu&s;t depend entirely upon the agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of its component &s;yllables. In part it doth; but not entirely; for we mu&s;t al&s;o take under con&s;ideration the effect that a number of &s;yllables compo&s;ing a word have in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In the fir&s;t place, &s;ylla|bles in immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, pronounced, each of them, with the &s;ame or nearly the &s;ame aperture of the mouth, produce a weak and imperfect &s;ound; witne&s;s the French words <HI>d&eacute;t&ecirc;t&eacute;</HI> (dete&s;ted), <HI>dit-il</HI> (&s;ays he), <HI>patetique</HI> (pathetic). On the other hand, a &s;yllable of the greate&s;t aperture &s;ucceed|ing one of the &s;malle&s;t, or the oppo&s;ite, makes a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which, becau&s;e of its remarkable di&s;agreeablene&s;s, is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by a proper name, <HI>viz. hiatus.</HI> The mo&s;t agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is, where the
<PB N="243" REF="242">
cavity is increa&s;ed and dimini&s;hed alternate|ly by moderate intervals. Secondly, words con&s;i&s;ting wholly of &s;yllables pronounced &s;low or of &s;yllables pronounced quick, com|monly called <HI>long</HI> and <HI>&s;hort &s;yllables,</HI> have little melody in them. Witne&s;s the words <HI>petitioner, fruiterer, dizzine&s;s.</HI> On the o|ther hand, the intermixture of long and &s;hort &s;yllables is remarkably agreeable; for example, <HI>degree, repent, wonderful, altitude, rapidity, independent, impetuo&s;ity.</HI> The cau&s;e will be explained afterward, in treat|ing of ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>Di&s;tingui&s;hable from the beauties above mentioned, there is a beauty of &s;ome words which ari&s;es from their &s;ignification. When the emotion rai&s;ed by the length or &s;hortne&s;s, the roughne&s;s or &s;moothne&s;s, of the &s;ound, re&s;embles in any degree what is rai&s;ed by the &s;en&s;e, we feel a very remarkable plea|&s;ure. But this &s;ubject belongs to the third &s;ection.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations afford a &s;tan|dard to every nation, for e&s;timating, pretty accurately, the comparative merit of the words that enter into their own language.
<PB N="244" REF="243">
And though at fir&s;t view they may be thought equally u&s;eful for e&s;timating the comparative merit of different languages; yet this holds not in fact, becau&s;e no per|&s;on can readily be found who is &s;ufficiently qualified to apply the &s;tandard. What I mean is, that different nations judge differ|ently of the har&s;hne&s;s or &s;moothne&s;s of ar|ticulate &s;ounds: a &s;ound, har&s;h and di&s;a|greeable to an Italian, may be abundantly &s;mooth to a northern ear. Where are we to find a judge to determine this contro|ver&s;y? and &s;uppo&s;ing a judge, upon what principle is his deci&s;ion to be founded? The ca&s;e here is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as in behaviour and manners. Plain-dealing and &s;incerity, liberty in words and actions, form the character of one people. Polite|ne&s;s, re&s;erve, and a total di&s;gui&s;e of every &s;entiment that can give offence, form the character of another people. To each the manners of the other are di&s;agreeable. An effeminate mind cannot bear the lea&s;t of that roughne&s;s and &s;everity, which is generally e&s;teemed manly when exerted upon proper occa&s;ions. Neither can an effeminate ear
<PB N="245" REF="244">
bear the lea&s;t har&s;hne&s;s in words that are deemed nervous and &s;ounding by tho&s;e ac|cu&s;tomed to a rougher tone of language. Mu&s;t we then relinqui&s;h all thoughts of comparing languages in the point of rough|ne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s, as a fruitle&s;s inquiry? Not altogether &s;o; for we may proceed a certain length, though without hope of an ultimate deci&s;ion. A language with difficulty pronounced even by natives, mu&s;t yield the preference to a &s;moother lan|guage. Again, &s;uppo&s;ing two languages pro|nounced with equal facility by natives, the preference, in my judgement, ought to be in favour of the rougher language; provided it be al&s;o &s;tored with a competent &s;hare of more mellow &s;ounds. This will be evident from attending to the different effects that articu|late &s;ound hath upon the mind. A &s;mooth gliding &s;ound is agreeable, by &s;moothing the mind and lulling it to re&s;t. A rough bold &s;ound, on the contrary, animates the mind. The effort perceived in pronoun|cing, is communicated to the hearers: they feel in their own minds a &s;imilar effort,
<PB N="246" REF="245">
which rou&s;es their attention and di&s;po|&s;es them to action. I mu&s;t add another con&s;ideration. The agreeablene&s;s of con|tra&s;t in the rougher language, for which the great variety of &s;ounds gives ample op|portunity, mu&s;t, even in an effeminate ear, prevail over the more uniform &s;ounds of the &s;moother language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the Italian tongue is rather too &s;mooth, &s;eems to appear from con&s;idering, that in ver&s;ification vowels are fre|quently &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in order to produce a rougher and bolder tone.</NOTE>. This appears to me all that can be &s;afely determined upon the pre&s;ent point. With re&s;pect to the o|ther circum&s;tances that con&s;titute the beau|ty of words, the &s;tandard above mentioned is infallible when apply'd to foreign langua|ges as well as to our own. For every man, whatever be his mother-tongue, is equally capable to judge of the length or &s;hortne&s;s of words, of the alternate opening and clo&s;ing of the mouth in &s;peaking, and of the relation which the &s;ound bears to the &s;en&s;e. In the&s;e particulars, the judgement is &s;u&s;ceptible of no prejudice from cu&s;tom, at lea&s;t of no invincible prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="246">
That the Engli&s;h tongue, originally har&s;h, is at pre&s;ent much &s;oftened by drop|ing in the pronunciation many redundant con&s;onants, is undoubtedly true. That it is not capable of being farther mellowed, without &s;uffering in its force and energy, will &s;carce be thought by any one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an ear. And yet &s;uch in Britain is the propen&s;ity for di&s;patch, that over|looking the maje&s;ty of words compo&s;ed of many &s;yllables aptly connected, the pre|vailing ta&s;te is, to &s;horten words, even at the expence of making them di&s;agreeable to the ear and har&s;h in the pronunciation. But I have no occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t upon this article, being prevented by an excellent writer, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, if any man ever did, the true genius of the Engli&s;h tongue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Swift's propo&s;al for correcting the Engli&s;h tongue, in a letter to the Earl of Oxford.</NOTE>. I cannot however forbear urging one ob|&s;ervation borrowed from that author. Seve|ral ten&s;es of our verbs are formed by add|ing the final &s;yllable <HI>ed,</HI> which, being a weak &s;ound, has remarkably the wor&s;e ef|fect
<PB N="248" REF="247">
by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t con&s;picuous place in the word. Upon that account, the vowel is in common &s;peech generally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the con&s;onant is added to the foregoing &s;yllable. Hence the follow|ing rugged &s;ounds, <HI>drudg'd, di&s;turb'd, re|buk'd, fledg'd.</HI> It is &s;till le&s;s excu&s;eable to follow this practice in writing; for the hur|ry of &s;peaking may excu&s;e what is altoge|ther improper in a compo&s;ition of any va|lue. The &s;yllable <HI>ed,</HI> it is true, makes but a poor figure at the end of a word: but we ought to &s;ubmit to that defect, rather than multiply the number of har&s;h words, which, after all that has been done, bear an over|proportion in our tongue. The author a|bove mentioned, by &s;howing a good ex|ample, did all in his power to re&s;tore that &s;yllable; and he well de&s;erves to be imi|tated. Some exceptions however I would make. A word which &s;ignifies labour, or any thing har&s;h or rugged, ought not to be &s;mooth. Therefore <HI>forc'd,</HI> with an apo|&s;trophe, is better than <HI>forced,</HI> without it. Another exception is, where the penult &s;yllable ends with a vowel. In that ca&s;e
<PB N="249" REF="248">
the final &s;yllable <HI>ed</HI> may be apo&s;trophized without making the word har&s;h. Examples, <HI>betray'd, carry'd, de&s;troy'd, employ'd.</HI></P>
<P>The article next in order, is to con&s;ider the mu&s;ic of words as united in a period. And as the arrangement of words in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion &s;o as to afford the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to the ear, depends on principles pretty re|mote from common view, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome general ob&s;ervations upon the effect that a number of objects have upon the mind when they are placed in an increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing &s;eries. The effect of &s;uch a &s;eries will be very different, according as re&s;emblance or contra&s;t pre|vails. Where the members of a &s;eries vary by &s;mall differences, re&s;emblance pre|vails; which, in a&s;cending, makes us con|ceive the &s;econd object of no greater &s;ize than the fir&s;t, the third of no greater &s;ize than the &s;econd, and &s;o of the re&s;t. This dimini&s;heth in appearance the &s;ize of the whole. Again, when beginning at the large&s;t object, we proceed gradually to the lea&s;t, re&s;emblance makes us imagine the &s;econd as large as the fir&s;t, and the third as
<PB N="250" REF="249">
large as the &s;econd; which in appearance magnifies every object of the &s;eries except the fir&s;t. On the other hand, in a &s;eries varying by great differences, where contra&s;t prevails, the effects are directly oppo&s;ite. A large object &s;ucceeding a &s;mall one of the &s;ame kind, appears by the oppo&s;ition lar|ger than u&s;ual: and a &s;mall object, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;ucceeding one that is large, appears le&s;s than u&s;ual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the rea&s;on, chap. 8.</NOTE>. Hence a remarkable plea&s;ure in viewing a &s;eries a&s;cending by large intervals; directly op|po&s;ite to what we feel when the intervals are &s;mall. Beginning at the &s;malle&s;t object of a &s;eries where contra&s;t prevails, this object has the &s;ame effect upon the mind as if it &s;tood &s;ingle without making a part of the &s;eries. But this is not the ca&s;e of the &s;econd object, which by means of contra&s;t makes a much greater figure than when viewed &s;ingly and apart; and the &s;ame effect is perceived in a&s;cending progre&s;&s;ively, till we arrive at the la&s;t object. The direct contrary effect is produced in de&s;cending; for in this direc|tion,
<PB N="251" REF="250">
every object, except the fir&s;t, makes a le&s;s figure than when viewed &s;eparately and independent of the &s;eries. We may then lay down as a maxim, which will hold in the compo&s;ition of language as well as of other &s;ubjects, That a &s;trong impul&s;e &s;uc|ceeding a weak, makes a double impre&s;|&s;ion on the mind; and that a weak impul&s;e &s;ucceeding a &s;trong, makes &s;carce any im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After e&s;tabli&s;hing this maxim, we can be at no lo&s;s about its application to the &s;ub|ject in hand. The following rule is laid down by Diomedes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De &s;tructura perfectae orationis, l. 2.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">"In verbis ob&s;er|vandum e&s;t, ne a majoribus ad minora de&s;cendat oratio; melius enim dicitur, <HI>Vir e&s;t optimus,</HI> quam, <HI>Vir optimus e&s;t.</HI>"</Q> This rule is applicable not only to &s;ingle words, but equally to entire members of a period, which, according to our author's expre&s;&s;ion, ought not more than &s;ingle words to proceed from the greater to the le&s;s, but from the le&s;s to the greater. In arranging the members of a period, on wri|ter

Again:

<L>Quorum crudelitas, no&s;tro &s;anguine non pote&s;t expleri.</L>
<BIBL>De oratore, l. 1. &sect; 52.</BIBL></Q>
This order of words or members gradually increa&s;ing in length, may, &s;o far as con|cerns the plea&s;ure of &s;ound &s;ingly, be de|nominated <HI>a climax in &s;ound.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="252">
The la&s;t article is the mu&s;ic of periods as united in a di&s;cour&s;e; which &s;hall be di&s;|patched in a very few words. By no other human means is it po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;ent to the mind, &s;uch a number of objects and in &s;o &s;wift a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as by &s;peaking or wri|ting. And for that rea&s;on, variety ought more to be &s;tudied in the&s;e, than in any o|ther &s;ort of compo&s;ition. Hence a rule re|garding the arrangement of the members of different periods with relation to each o|ther, That to avoid a tedious uniformity of &s;ound and cadence, the arrangement, the cadence, and the length of the&s;e members, ought to be diver&s;ified as much as po&s;&s;ible.

<HEAD>SECT. II. Beauty of language with re&s;pect to &s;ignifi|cation.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well &s;aid by a noted writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scot's Chri&s;tian life.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"That by means of &s;peech we can divert our &s;orrows, mingle our mirth, impart our &s;ecrets, communicate our coun&s;els, and make mutual compacts and agreements to &s;upply and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other."</Q> Con&s;idering &s;peech as contributing thus to &s;o many good purpo&s;es, it follows, that the chu&s;ing words which have an accurate meaning, and tend to convey clear and di&s;tinct ideas, mu&s;t be one of its capital beauties. This cau&s;e of beauty, is too exten&s;ive to be handled as a branch of any other &s;ubject. To a&s;certain with accuracy even the proper meaning of words, not to talk of their figurative power, would require a large volume; an u&s;eful work indeed; but not to be attempted with|out a large &s;tock of time, &s;tudy, and reflec|tion.
<PB N="255" REF="254">
This branch therefore of the &s;ubject I mu&s;t humbly decline. Nor do I propo&s;e to exhau&s;t all the other beauties of language with re&s;pect to &s;ignification. The reader, in a work like the pre&s;ent, cannot fairly expect more than a &s;light &s;ketch of tho&s;e that make the greate&s;t figure. This is a ta&s;k which I attempt the more willingly, as it appears to be connected with &s;ome prin|ciples in human nature; and the rules I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to lay down, will, if I judge aright, be agreeable illu&s;trations of the&s;e principles. Every &s;ubject mu&s;t be of importance that tends in any mea&s;ure to un|fold the human heart; for what other &s;cience is more worthy of human beings?</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ubject is &s;o exten&s;ive, that, to prevent confu&s;ion, it mu&s;t be divided in|to parts; and what follows &s;ugge&s;ts a di|vi&s;ion into two parts. In every period, two things are to be regarded, equally capital; fir&s;t, the words of which the period is com|po&s;ed; next, the arrangement of the&s;e words. The former re&s;emble the &s;tones that com|po&s;e a building; and the latter re&s;embles the order in which the&s;e &s;tones are placed.
<PB N="256" REF="255">
Hence the beauty of language with re&s;pect to its meaning, may not improperly be di&s;|tingui&s;hed into two kinds. The fir&s;t con|&s;i&s;ts in a right choice of words or materials for con&s;tructing the period; and the other con&s;i&s;ts in a due arrangement of the&s;e words or materials. I &s;hall begin with rules that direct us to a right choice of words, and then proceed to rules that concern their ar|rangement.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the former, commu|nication of thought being the principal end of language, it is a rule, That per&s;picuity ought not to be &s;acrificed to any other beauty whatever. If it &s;hould be doubted whether per&s;picuity be a po&s;itive beauty, it cannot be doubted, that the want of it is the greate&s;t defect. Nothing therefore in the &s;tructure of language ought more to be &s;tudied, than to prevent all ob&s;curity in the expre&s;&s;ion; for to have no meaning, is but one degree wor&s;e than to expre&s;s it &s;o as not to be un|der&s;tood. Want of per&s;picuity from a wrong arrangement, belongs to the next branch. I &s;hall give a few examples where the ob&s;curity ari&s;es from a wrong choice of
<PB N="257" REF="256">
words; and as this defect is &s;o common in ordinary writers as to make examples from them unnece&s;&s;ary, I confine my&s;elf to the mo&s;t celebrated authors.</P>

<P>In the preceding chapter, concerning the language of pa&s;&s;ion, I had occa&s;ion to give many examples of deviations from this
<PB N="260" REF="259">
rule with regard to the manner of expre&s;&s;|ing pa&s;&s;ions and their &s;entiments. But as the rule concerns the manner of expre&s;&s;ing thoughts and ideas of all kinds, it has an exten&s;ive influence in directing us to the choice of proper materials. In that view it mu&s;t be branched out into &s;everal particu|lars. And I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that to write with elegance, it is not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s barely the conjunction or disjunction of the members of the thought. It is a beauty to find a &s;imilar conjunction or disjunction in the words. This may be illu&s;trated by a familiar exam|ple. When we have occa&s;ion to mention the intimate connection that the &s;oul has with the body, the expre&s;&s;ion ought to be <HI>the &s;oul and body</HI>; becau&s;e the particle <HI>the,</HI> re|lative to both, makes a connection in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which re&s;embles in &s;ome degree the connection in the thought. But when the &s;oul is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the body, it is better to &s;ay <HI>the &s;oul and the body,</HI> becau&s;e the disjunction in the words re&s;embles the disjunction in the thought.

objects. For it makes the re&s;emblance the more entire to find it extended even to the words. To illu&s;trate this rule, I &s;hall give various examples of deviations from it. I begin with the words that expre&s;s the re|&s;emblance.

<P>The pre&s;ent head, which relates to the choice of materials, &s;hall be clo&s;ed with a rule concerning the u&s;e of copulatives. Longinus ob&s;erves, that it animates a period to drop the copulatives; and he gives the following example from Xenophon.

<BIBL>Treati&s;e of the Sublime, cap. 16.</BIBL></Q>
The rea&s;on I take to be what follows. A continued &s;ound, if not &s;trong, tends to lay us a&s;leep. An interrupted &s;ound rou|&s;es and animates by its repeated impul&s;es. Hence it is, that &s;yllables collected into feet, being pronounced with a &s;en&s;ible in|terval betwixt each, make more lively im|pre&s;&s;ions than can be made by a continued &s;ound. A period, the members of which are connected by copulatives, produceth an effect upon the mind approaching to that of a continued &s;ound: and therefore to &s;uppre&s;s the copulatives mu&s;t animate a de&s;cription. To &s;uppre&s;s the copulatives hath another good effect. The mem|bers of a period connected by the proper copulatives, glide &s;moothly and gently a|long; and are a proof of &s;edatene&s;s and lei&s;ure in the &s;peaker. On the other hand, a man in the hurry of pa&s;&s;ion, neglecting copulatives and other particles, expre&s;&s;es the principal image only. Hence it is, that
<PB N="283" REF="282">
hurry or quick action is be&s;t expre&s;&s;ed with|out copulatives:

In this view Longinus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of the &s;ublime, cap. 16.</NOTE> ju&s;tly compares co|pulatives in a period to &s;trait tying, which in a race ob&s;tructs the freedom of motion.</P>
<P>It follows from the &s;ame premi&s;&s;es, that to multiply copulatives in the &s;ame period ought to be avoided. For if the laying a&s;ide copulatives give force and liveline&s;s, a redun|dancy of them mu&s;t render the period languid. I appeal to the following in&s;tance, though there are not more than two copulatives.

<P>We proceed to the &s;econd kind of beauty, which con&s;i&s;ts in a due arrangement of the words or materials. This branch of the &s;ubject is not le&s;s nice than exten&s;ive; and
<PB N="285" REF="284">
I de&s;pair to put it in a clear light, until a &s;ketch be given of the general principles that govern the &s;tructure or compo&s;ition of language.</P>
<P>Every thought, generally &s;peaking, con|tains one capital object con&s;idered as acting or as &s;uffering. This object is expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ub&s;tantive noun. Its action is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by an active verb; and the thing affected by the action is expre&s;&s;ed by ano|ther &s;ub&s;tantive noun. Its &s;uffering or pa&s;|&s;ive &s;tate is expre&s;&s;ed by a pa&s;&s;ive verb, and the thing which acts upon it, by a &s;ub&s;tantive noun. Be&s;ide the&s;e, which are the capital parts of a &s;entence or period, there are generally under-parts. Each of the &s;ub&s;tan|tives as well as the verb, may be qualified. Time, place, purpo&s;e, motive, means, in|&s;trument, and a thou&s;and other circum|&s;tances, may be nece&s;&s;ary to complete the thought. And in what manner the&s;e &s;eve|ral parts are connected together in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, will appear from what follows.</P>
<P>In a complete thought or mental propo|&s;ition, all the members and parts are mu|tually related, &s;ome &s;lightly, &s;ome more inti|mately.
<PB N="286" REF="285">
In communicating &s;uch a thought, it is not &s;ufficient that the component ideas be clearly expre&s;&s;ed: it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that all the relations contained in the thought be expre&s;&s;ed according to their different de|grees of intimacy. To annex a certain meaning to a certain &s;ound or word, re|quires no art. The great nicety in all lan|guages is, to expre&s;s the various relations that connect together the parts of the thought. Could we &s;uppo&s;e this branch of language to be &s;till a &s;ecret, it would puzzle, I am apt to think, the greate&s;t grammarian ever exi&s;ted, to invent an expeditious me|thod. And yet, by the guidance merely of nature, the rude and illiterate have been led to a method &s;o perfect, that it appears not &s;u&s;ceptible of any improvement. Without a clear conception of the manner of expre&s;&s;|ing relations, one at every turn mu&s;t be at a lo&s;s about the beauties of language; and upon that &s;ubject therefore I find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a few words.</P>
<P>Words that import a relation, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that do not. Sub|&s;tantives commonly imply no relation, &s;uch
<PB N="287" REF="286">
as <HI>animal, man, tree, river.</HI> Adjectives, verbs, and adverbs, imply a relation. The adjective <HI>good</HI> mu&s;t be connected with &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantive, &s;ome being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that quality. The verb <HI>write</HI> mu&s;t be applied to &s;ome per&s;on who writes; and the adverbs <HI>moderately, diligently,</HI> have plainly a refer|ence to &s;ome action which they modify. When in language a relative term is intro|duced, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to complete the expre&s;&s;ion, is, to a&s;certain that thing to which the term relates. For an&s;wering this purpo&s;e, I ob&s;erve in Greek and Latin two different methods. Adjectives are declined as well as &s;ub&s;tantives; and declen&s;ion &s;erves to a&s;certain the connection that is betwixt them. If the word that expre&s;&s;es the &s;ub|ject be, for example, in the nominative ca&s;e, &s;o al&s;o mu&s;t the word be that expre&s;&s;es its quality. Example, <HI>vir bonus.</HI> Again, verbs are related, on the one hand, to the agent; and, on the other, to the &s;ubject upon which the action is exerted. A contrivance &s;imilar to that now mentioned, &s;erves to ex|pre&s;s this double relation. The nominative ca&s;e is appropriated to the agent, the accu|&s;ative

to the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject; and the verb is put in the fir&s;t &s;econd or third per&s;on, to corre&s;pond the more intimately with both. Examples: <HI>Ego amo Tulliam</HI>; <HI>tu amas Sem|proniam</HI>; <HI>Brutus amat Portiam.</HI> The other method is by juxtapo&s;ition, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to words only that are not declined, adverbs for example, articles, prepo&s;itions, and conjunctions. In the Engli&s;h language there are few declen&s;ions; and therefore juxtapo&s;ition is our chief re|&s;ource. Adjectives accompany their &s;ub|&s;tantives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taking advantage of a declen&s;ion to &s;eparate an adjective from its &s;ub&s;tantive, as is commonly practi&s;ed in Latin, though it detract not from per&s;picuity, is certainly le&s;s neat than the Engli&s;h method of juxtapo&s;ition. Contiguity is more expre&s;&s;ive of an intimate relation, than re&s;emblance merely of the final &s;yllables. Latin indeed has evidently the advantage when the adjective and &s;ub&s;tantive happen to be connected by contiguity as well as by the re&s;emblance of the final &s;yllables.</NOTE>; an adverb accompanies the word it qualifies; and the verb occupies the middle place betwixt the active and pa&s;|&s;ive &s;ubjects to which it relates.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be obvious, that tho&s;e terms which have nothing relative in their &s;ignification,
<PB N="289" REF="290">
cannot be connected in &s;o ea&s;y a manner. When two &s;ub&s;tantives happen to be con|nected, as cau&s;e and effect, as principal and acce&s;&s;ory, or in any other manner, &s;uch connection cannot be expre&s;&s;ed by contigu|ity &s;olely; for words mu&s;t often in a period be placed together which are not thus rela|ted. The relation betwixt &s;ub&s;tantives, therefore, cannot otherwi&s;e be expre&s;&s;ed than by particles denoting the relation. Latin indeed and Greek, by their declen|&s;ions, go a certain length to expre&s;s &s;uch re|lations, without the aid of particles. The relation of property, for example, betwixt Cae&s;ar and his hor&s;e is, expre&s;&s;ed by putting the latter in the nominative ca&s;e, the for|mer in the genitive; <HI>equus Cae&s;aris.</HI> The like in Engli&s;h, <HI>Cae&s;ar's hor&s;e.</HI> But in other in&s;tances, declen&s;ions not being u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h language, relations of this kind are commonly expre&s;&s;ed by prepo&s;itions.</P>
<P>This form of connecting by prepo&s;itions, is not confined to &s;ub&s;tantives. Qualities, at|tributes, manner of exi&s;ting or acting, and all other circum&s;tances, may in the &s;ame manner be connected with the &s;ub&s;tantives
<PB N="290" REF="291">
to which they relate. This is done artifi|cially by converting the circum&s;tance into a &s;ub&s;tantive, in which condition it is qualified to be connected with the principal &s;ubject by a prepo&s;ition, in the manner above de&s;cri|bed. For example, the adjective <HI>wi&s;e</HI> being converted into the &s;ub&s;tantive <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> gives opportunity for the expre&s;&s;ion <Q REND="inline">"a man <HI>of</HI> wi&s;dom,"</Q> in&s;tead of the more &s;imple ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>a wi&s;e man.</HI> This variety in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, enriches language. I ob&s;erve be|&s;ide, that the u&s;ing a prepo&s;ition in this ca&s;e, is not always a matter of choice. It is in|di&s;pen&s;able with re&s;pect to every circum|&s;tance that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle adjective or adverb.</P>
<P>To pave the way for the rules of arrange|ment, one other preliminary mu&s;t be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, which is, to explain the difference betwixt a natural &s;tyle, and that where tran&s;po&s;ition or inver&s;ion prevails. There are, it is true, no preci&s;e boundaries betwixt the&s;e two; for they run into each other, like the &s;hades of different colours. No per&s;on however is at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h them in their extremes: and it is nece&s;&s;ary to make
<PB N="291" REF="292">
the di&s;tinction; becau&s;e though &s;ome of the rules I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention are common to both, yet each has rules peculiar to it&s;elf. In a natural &s;tyle, relative words are by juxtapo&s;ition connected with tho&s;e to which they relate, going before or after, according to the peculiar genius of the lan|guage. Again, a circum&s;tance connected by a prepo&s;ition, follows naturally the word with which it is connected. But this ar|rangement may be varied, when a different order is more beautiful. A circum&s;tance may be placed before the word with which it is connected by a prepo&s;ition; and may be interjected even betwixt a relative word and that to which it relates. When &s;uch liberties are frequently taken, the &s;tyle be|comes inverted or tran&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>But as the liberty of inver&s;ion is a capital point in handling the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine it more narrowly, and in particular to trace the &s;everal degrees in which an inverted &s;tyle recedes more and more from that which is natural. And fir&s;t, as to the placing a circum&s;tance before the word with which it is connected, I ob&s;erve,
<PB N="292" REF="293">
that it is the ea&s;ie&s;t of all inver&s;ion, even &s;o ea&s;y as to be con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tyle that is properly termed natural. Witne&s;s the fol|lowing examples.<Q>In the &s;incerity of my heart, I profe&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q><Q>By our own ill management, we are brought to &s;o low an ebb of wealth and credit, that, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q><Q>On Thur&s;day morning there was little or nothing tran&s;acted in Change-alley.</Q><Q>At St Bride's church in Fleet&s;treet, Mr Wool|&s;ton, (who writ again&s;t the miracles of our Saviour), in the utmo&s;t terrors of con&s;cience made a public recantation.</Q></P>
<P>The interjecting a circum&s;tance betwixt a relative word and that to which it relates, is more properly termed inver&s;ion; becau&s;e, by a violent disjunction of words intimately connected, it recedes farther from a natural &s;tyle. But this liberty has al&s;o degrees; for the disjunction is more violent in &s;ome ca&s;es than in others. This I mu&s;t al&s;o explain: and to give a ju&s;t notion of the difference, I mu&s;t crave liberty of my reader to enter a
<PB N="293" REF="294">
little more into an ab&s;tract &s;ubject, than would otherwi&s;e be my choice.</P>
<P>In nature, though a &s;ub&s;tance cannot ex|i&s;t without its qualities, nor a quality with|out a &s;ub&s;tance; yet in our conception of the&s;e, a material difference may be remark|ed. I cannot conceive a quality but as be|longing to &s;ome &s;ubject: it makes indeed a part of the idea which is formed of the &s;ub|ject. But the oppo&s;ite holds not. Though I cannot form a conception of a &s;ubject de|void of all qualities, a partial conception may however be formed of it, laying a&s;ide or ab&s;tracting from any particular quality. I can, for example, form the idea of a fine Arabian hor&s;e without regard to his colour, or of a white hor&s;e without regard to his &s;ize. Such partial conception of a &s;ubject, is &s;till more ea&s;y with re&s;pect to action or motion; which is an occa&s;ional attribute only, and has not the &s;ame permanency with colour or figure. I cannot form an idea of motion independent of a body; but there is nothing more ea&s;y than to form an idea of a body at re&s;t. Hence it appears, that the degree of inver&s;ion depends greatly
<PB N="294" REF="295">
on the order in which the related words are placed. When a &s;ub&s;tantive occupies the fir&s;t place, we cannot fore&s;ee what is to be &s;aid of it. The idea therefore which this word &s;ugge&s;ts, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the mind at lea&s;t for a moment, independent of the re|lative words afterward introduced; and if it can &s;o &s;ub&s;i&s;t, that moment may without difficulty be prolonged by interjecting a cir|cum&s;tance betwixt the &s;ub&s;tantive and its connections. Examples therefore of this kind, will &s;carce alone be &s;ufficient to deno|minate a &s;tyle inverted. The ca&s;e is very different, where the word that occupies the fir&s;t place, denotes a quality or an action; for as the&s;e cannot be conceived without a &s;ubject, they cannot without greater violence be &s;eparated from the &s;ubject that follows. And for that rea&s;on, every &s;uch &s;eparation by means of an interjected circum&s;tance belongs to an inverted &s;tyle.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this doctrine examples being nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e where the word fir&s;t introduced does not imply a relation.<Q><PB N="295" REF="296">

In the mean time, it ought not to e&s;cape ob|&s;ervation, that the mind of man is happily &s;o con&s;tituted as to reli&s;h inver&s;ion, though in one re&s;pect unnatural; and to reli&s;h it &s;o much, as in many ca&s;es to admit a violent disjunction of words that by the &s;en&s;e are in|timately connected.

Ambiguities occa|&s;ioned by a wrong arrangement are of two &s;orts; one where the arrangement leads to a wrong &s;en&s;e, and one where the &s;en&s;e is left doubtful. The fir&s;t being the more culpable, &s;hall take the lead, beginning with examples of words put in a wrong place.

<P>From the&s;e examples, the following ob|&s;ervation will readily occur, that a circum|&s;tance ought never to be placed betwixt two capital members of a period; for by &s;uch &s;ituation it mu&s;t always be doubtful, &s;o far as we gather from the arrangement, to which of the two members it belongs. Where it is interjected, as it ought to be, betwixt parts of the member to which it belongs, the ambiguity is removed, and the capital members are kept di&s;tinct, which is a great beauty in compo&s;ition. In gene|ral, to pre&s;erve members di&s;tinct which &s;ignify things di&s;tingui&s;hed in the thought,
<PB N="307" REF="308">
the &s;ure method is, to place fir&s;t in the con&s;equent member &s;ome word that cannot connect with what precedes it.</P>
<P>If by any one it &s;hall be thought, that the objections here are too &s;crupulous, and that the defect of per&s;picuity is ea&s;ily &s;up|plied by accurate punctuation; the an&s;wer is, That punctuation may remove an am|biguity, but will never produce that pecu|liar beauty which is felt when the &s;en&s;e comes out clearly and di&s;tinctly by means of a happy arrangement. Such influence has this beauty, that by a natural tran&s;ition of feeling, it is communicated to the very &s;ound of the words, &s;o as in appearance to improve the mu&s;ic of the period. But as this curious &s;ubject comes in more properly afterward, it is &s;ufficient at pre&s;ent to appeal to experience, that a period &s;o arranged as to bring out the &s;en&s;e clear, &s;eems always more mu&s;ical than where the &s;en&s;e is left in any degree doubtful.</P>
<P>A rule de&s;ervedly occupying the &s;econd place, is, That words expre&s;&s;ing things con|nected in the thought, ought to be placed as near together as po&s;&s;ible. This rule is
<PB N="308" REF="309">
derived immediately from human nature, in which there is di&s;covered a remarkable propen&s;ity to place together things that are in any manner connected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>.

<P>If there be room for a choice, the &s;ooner a circum&s;tance be introduced, the better. Circum&s;tances are proper for that coolne&s;s of mind, with which a period as well as a work is commenced. In the progre&s;s, the mind warms, and has a greater reli&s;h for matters of importance. When a circum|&s;tance is placed at the beginning or near the beginning of the period, the tran&s;ition from it to the principal &s;ubject is agreeable: it is like a&s;cending or mounting upward. On the other hand, to place it late in the period has a bad effect; for after being engaged in

<P>In arranging a period, it is of importance to determine in what part of it a word makes the greate&s;t figure, whether in the begin|ning, during the currency, or at the clo&s;e. The breaking &s;ilence rou&s;es the attention to what is &s;aid; and therefore deeper impre&s;|&s;ion is made at the beginning than during the currency. The beginning, however, mu&s;t yield to the clo&s;e; which being &s;uc|ceeded by a pau&s;e, affords time for a word to make its deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Hence the following rule, That to give the utmo&s;t force to a period, it ought if po&s;&s;ible to be clo&s;ed with that word which makes the greate&s;t figure. The opportunity of a pau&s;e &s;hould not be thrown away upon acce&s;&s;ories, but re&s;erved for the principal object, in order that it may make a full impre&s;&s;ion. This is an additional rea&s;on again&s;t clo&s;ing a pe|riod with a circum&s;tance. There are how|ever periods that admit not this &s;tructure;
<PB N="319" REF="320">
and in that ca&s;e, the capital word ought if po&s;&s;ible to be placed in the front, which next to the clo&s;e is the mo&s;t advantageous for making an impre&s;&s;ion. Hence, in di|recting our di&s;cour&s;e to any man, we ought to begin with his name; and one will be &s;en&s;ible of a degradation, when this rule is neglected, as it frequently is for the &s;ake of ver&s;e.

<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of what is &s;aid in this and the foregoing &s;ection, upon the method of arranging the words of a period &s;o as to make the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to &s;ound as well as &s;ignification, is compre|hended in the following ob&s;ervation. That order of the words in a period will always be the mo&s;t agreeable, where, without ob|&s;curing the &s;en&s;e, the mo&s;t important i|mages,
<PB N="321" REF="322">
the mo&s;t &s;onorous words, and the longe&s;t members, bring up the rear.</P>
<P>Hitherto of arranging &s;ingle words, &s;in|gle members, and &s;ingle circum&s;tances. But the enumeration of many particulars in the &s;ame period is often nece&s;&s;ary; and the que&s;tion is, In what order they &s;hould be placed. It does not &s;eem ea&s;y at fir&s;t view to bring a &s;ubject apparently &s;o loo&s;e under any general rules. But luckily reflecting upon what is &s;aid in the fir&s;t chapter about order, we find rules laid down to our hand, &s;o as to leave us no harder ta&s;k than their application to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. And, fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to the enumerating a number of particulars of equal rank, it is laid down in the place cited, that as there is no foundation for preferring any one be|fore the re&s;t, it is indifferent to the mind in what order they be viewed. And it is only nece&s;&s;ary to be added here, that for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is indifferent in what order they be named. 2dly, If a number of objects of the &s;ame kind, differing only in &s;ize, are to be ranged along a &s;traight
<PB N="322" REF="323">
line, the mo&s;t agreeable order to the eye is that of an increa&s;ing &s;eries. In &s;urveying a number of &s;uch objects, beginning at the lea&s;t and proceeding to greater and greater, the mind &s;wells gradually with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive objects, and in its progre&s;s has a very &s;en|&s;ible plea&s;ure. Preci&s;ely for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, the words expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch objects ought to be placed in the &s;ame order. The beauty of this figure, which may be term|ed <HI>a climax in &s;en&s;e,</HI> has e&s;caped Lord Bo|lingbroke in the fir&s;t member of the fol|lowing period.<Q>Let but one great, brave, di&s;intere&s;ted, active man ari&s;e, and he will be received, followed, and almo&s;t adored.</Q> The following arrangement has &s;en&s;ibly a better effect.<Q>Let but one brave, great, active, di&s;intere&s;t|ed man ari&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Whether the &s;ame rule ought to be follow|ed in enumerating men of different ranks, &s;eems doubtful. On the one hand, a pro|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="323" REF="324">
of a number of per&s;ons, pre&s;enting the lowe&s;t cla&s;s fir&s;t, and ri&s;ing upon the eye in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion till it terminate upon the high|e&s;t, is undoubtedly the mo&s;t agreeable or|der. On the other hand, in every li&s;t of names, it is cu&s;tomary to &s;et the per&s;on of the greate&s;t dignity at the top, and to de&s;cend gradually through his inferiors. Where the purpo&s;e is to honour the per&s;ons named according to their rank, the latter order ought to be followed; but every one who regards him&s;elf only, or his reader, will chu&s;e the former order. 3dly, As the &s;en&s;e of order directs the eye to de&s;cend from the principal to its greate&s;t acce&s;&s;ory, and from the whole to its greate&s;t part, and in the &s;ame order through all the parts and acce&s;&s;ories till we arrive at the minu|te&s;t; the &s;ame order ought to be followed in the enumeration of &s;uch particulars. I &s;hall give on familiar example. Talking of the parts of a column, <HI>viz.</HI> the ba&s;e, the &s;haft, the capital, the&s;e are capable of &s;ix different arrangements, and the que&s;tion is, Which is the be&s;t? When one has in view the erection of a column, he will na|turally
<PB N="324" REF="325">
be led to expre&s;s the parts in the or|der above mentioned; which at the &s;ame time is agreeable by mounting upward. But con&s;idering the column as it &s;tands without reference to its erection, the &s;en&s;e of order, as ob&s;erved above, requires the chief part to be named fir&s;t. For that rea&s;on we begin with the &s;haft; and the ba&s;e comes next in order, that we may a|&s;cend from it to the capital. La&s;tly, In tracing the particulars of any natural ope|ration, order requires that we follow the cour&s;e of nature. Hi&s;torical facts are rela|ted in the order of time. We begin at the founder of a family, and proceed from him to his de&s;cendents. But in de&s;cribing a lofty oak, we begin with the trunk, and a&s;cend to the branches.</P>
<P>When force and liveline&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion are aimed at, the rule is, to &s;u&s;pend the thought as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to bring it out full and entire at the clo&s;e. This cannot be done but by inverting the natu|ral arrangement, and by introducing a word or member before its time. By &s;uch in|ver&s;ion our curio&s;ity is rai&s;ed about what is
<PB N="325" REF="326">
to follow; and it is agreeable to have our curio&s;ity gratified at the clo&s;e of the period. Such arrangement produceth on the mind an effect &s;imilar to a &s;troke exerted upon the body by the whole collected force of the agent. On the other hand, where a pe|riod is &s;o con&s;tructed as to admit more than one complete clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e, the curio&s;ity of the reader is exhau&s;ted at the fir&s;t clo&s;e, and what follows appears languid or &s;uper|fluous. His di&s;appointment contributes al|&s;o to this appearance, when he finds, that, contrary to his expectation, the period is not yet fini&s;hed. Cicero, and after him Quintilian, recommend the verb to the la&s;t place. This method evidently tends to &s;u&s;pend the &s;en&s;e till the clo&s;e of the pe|riod; for without the verb the &s;en&s;e can|not be complete. And when the verb happens to be the capital word, which is frequently the ca&s;e, it ought at any rate to be put la&s;t, according to another rule, above laid down. I proceed as u&s;ual to illu&s;trate this rule by examples. The following pe|riod is placed in its natural order.

None of the rules for the compo&s;ition of periods are more liable to be abu&s;ed, than tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned: witne&s;s many Latin writers, among the moderns e&s;pecially, who&s;e &s;tyle, by inver&s;ions too violent, is rendered har&s;h and ob&s;cure. Su&s;pen&s;ion of the thought till the clo&s;e of the period, ought never to be preferred before per&s;pi|cuity. Neither ought &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion to be attempted in a long period; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the mind is bewildered among a profu&s;ion of words. A traveller, while he is puzzled about the road, reli&s;hes not the fine&s;t pro&s;pects.<Q>All the rich pre&s;ents which A&s;tyages had given him at parting, keeping only &s;ome Median hor&s;es, in order to propagate the breed of them in Per&s;ia, he di&s;tributed among his friends whom he left at the court of Ecbatana.

<P>The foregoing rules concern the arrange|ment of a &s;ingle period. I &s;hall add one rule more concerning the di&s;tribution of a di&s;cour&s;e into different periods. A &s;hort period is lively and familiar. A long pe|riod,
<PB N="329" REF="330">
requiring more attention, makes an impre&s;&s;ion grave and &s;olemn. In general, a writer ought to &s;tudy a mixture of long and &s;hort periods, which prevents an irk|&s;ome uniformity, and entertains the mind with variety of impre&s;&s;ions. In particular, long periods ought to be avoided till the reader's attention be thoroughly engaged; and therefore a di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially of the familiar kind, ought never to be introduced with a long period. For that rea&s;on, the commencement of a letter to a very young lady on her marriage is faulty.
<Q>Madam, The hurry and impertinence of recei|ving and paying vi&s;its on account of your marriage, being now over, you are beginning to enter into a cour&s;e of life, where you will want much advice to divert you from falling into many errors, foppe|ries, and follies, to which your &s;ex is &s;ubject.

<P>Before we proceed farther, it may be proper to take a review of the rules laid
<PB N="330" REF="331">
down in this and the preceding &s;ection, in order to make &s;ome general ob&s;ervations. The natural order of the words and mem|bers of a period, is undoubtedly the &s;ame with the natural order of the ideas that compo&s;e the thought. The tendency of many of the foregoing rules, is to &s;ub&s;titute an artificial arrangement, in order to reach &s;ome beauty either of &s;ound or meaning that cannot be reached in the natural or|der. But &s;eldom it happens, that in the &s;ame period there is place for a plurality of the&s;e rules. If one beauty can be catched, another mu&s;t be relinqui&s;hed. The only que&s;tion is, Which ought to be preferred? This is a que&s;tion that cannot be re&s;olved by any general rule. But practice, &s;up|ported by a good ta&s;te, will in mo&s;t in&s;tan|ces make the choice ea&s;y. The component words and members of a period, are a&s;cer|tained by the &s;ubject. If the natural order be not reli&s;hed, a few trials will di&s;cover that artificial order which has the be&s;t effect. All that can be &s;aid in general is, that in making a choice, &s;ound ought to yield to &s;ignification.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="332">
The tran&s;po&s;ing words and members out of their natural order, &s;o remarkable in the learned languages, has been the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation. It is agreed on all hands, that &s;uch tran&s;po&s;ition or inver&s;ion be&s;tows upon a period a very &s;en&s;ible degree of force and elevation; and yet writers &s;eem to be at a lo&s;s in what manner to account for this effect. Cer&ccedil;eau<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflections &s;ur la poe&s;ie Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e.</NOTE> a&s;cribes &s;o much power to inver&s;ion, as to make it the characteri&s;tic of French ver&s;e, and the &s;ingle circum&s;tance which in that language di&s;tingui&s;hes ver&s;e from pro&s;e. And yet he pretends not to &s;ay, that it hath any other power but to rai&s;e &s;urpri&s;e; he mu&s;t mean curio&s;ity; which is done by &s;u&s;pending the thought during the period, and bringing it out en|tire at the clo&s;e. This indeed is one power of inver&s;ion; but neither its &s;ole power, nor even that which is the mo&s;t remarkable, as is made plain above. But waving cen&s;ure, which is not an agreeable ta&s;k, I enter into the matter. And I begin with ob&s;erving, that if a conformity betwixt words and their
<PB N="332" REF="333">
meaning be agreeable, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be agreeable to find the &s;ame order or ar|rangement in both. Hence the beauty of a plain or natural &s;tyle, where the order of the words corre&s;ponds preci&s;ely to the order of the ideas. Nor is this the &s;ingle beauty of a natural &s;tyle: it is al&s;o agreeable upon account of its &s;implicity and per&s;picuity. This ob&s;ervation throws light upon the &s;ubject. For if a natural &s;tyle be in it&s;elf agreeable, a tran&s;po&s;ed &s;tyle cannot be &s;o. And therefore, it cannot otherwi&s;e be a|greeable, but as contributing to &s;ome po&s;i|tive beauty which is excluded in a natural &s;tyle. To be confirmed in this opinion, we need but reflect upon &s;ome of the fore|going rules, which make it evident, that language, by means of inver&s;ion, is &s;u&s;cep|tible of many beauties that are totally ex|cluded in a natural arrangement of words. From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es it clearly follows, that inver&s;ion ought not to be indulged, un|le&s;s in order to reach &s;ome beauty &s;upe|rior to that of a natural &s;tyle. It may with great certainty be pronounced, that every inver&s;ion which is not governed by
<PB N="333" REF="334">
this rule, will appear har&s;h and &s;trained, and be di&s;reli&s;hed by every one of ta&s;te. Hence the beauty of inver&s;ion when happily conducted; the beauty, not of an end, but of means, as furni&s;hing opportunity for num|berle&s;s ornaments that find no place in a natu|ral &s;tyle. Hence the force, the elevation, the harmony, the cadence, of &s;ome compo&s;i|tions. Hence the manifold beauties of the Greek and Roman tongues, of which li|ving languages afford but faint imitations.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Beauty of language from a re&s;emblance betwixt &s;ound and &s;ignification.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;emblance betwixt the &s;ound and &s;ignification of certain words, is a beauty, which has e&s;caped no critical wri|ter, and yet is not handled with accuracy by any of them. They have probably been erroneou&s;ly of opinion, that a beauty &s;o obvious in the feeling, requires no ex|planation
<PB N="334" REF="335">
in the under&s;tanding. In order to &s;upply this defect, I &s;hall give examples of the various re&s;emblances betwixt &s;ound and &s;ignification; and at the &s;ame time &s;hall endeavour to explain why &s;uch re&s;em|blances are beautiful. I begin with exam|ples where the re&s;emblance betwixt the &s;ound and &s;ignification is the mo&s;t entire; proceeding to others, where the re&s;em|blance is le&s;s and le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>There being frequently a &s;trong re&s;em|blance betwixt different &s;ounds, it will not be &s;urpri&s;ing to find a natural &s;ound imita|ted by one that is articulate. Thus the &s;ound of a bow-&s;tring is imitated by the words that expre&s;s it.

<P>No per&s;on can be at a lo&s;s about the cau&s;e of this beauty. It is obviou&s;ly that of imi|tation.</P>
<P>That there is any other natural re&s;em|blance betwixt &s;ound and &s;ignification, mu&s;t not be taken for granted. There is evidently no re&s;emblance betwixt &s;ound and motion, nor betwixt &s;ound and &s;entiment. In this matter, we are apt to be deceived by artful reading or pronouncing. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;age may be pronounced in many different tones, elevated or humble, &s;weet or har&s;h, bri&s;k or melancholy, &s;o as to accord with the thought or &s;entiment. Such concord, de|pending on artful pronunciation, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that concord betwixt &s;ound and &s;en&s;e, which is perceived in &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions independent of artful pronun|ciation.
<PB N="336" REF="337">
The latter is the poet's work: the former mu&s;t be attributed to the reader. Another thing contributes &s;till more to the deceit. In language, &s;ound and &s;en&s;e are &s;o intimately connected, as that the proper|ties of the one are readily communicated to the other. An emotion of grandeur, of &s;weetne&s;s, of melancholy, or of compa&s;&s;ion, though occa&s;ioned by the thought &s;olely, is transferred upon the words, which by that means re&s;emble in appearance the thought that is expre&s;&s;ed by them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>. I have great rea&s;on to recommend the&s;e ob&s;ervations to my reader, con&s;idering how inaccurately the pre&s;ent &s;ubject is handled by critics. Not one of them di&s;tingui&s;hes the natural re|&s;emblance of &s;ound and &s;ignification, from the artificial re&s;emblance now de&s;cribed. Witne&s;s Vida in particular, who in a very long pa&s;&s;age has given very few examples, but what are of the latter kind<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Poet. L. 3. l. 365.&mdash;454.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That there may be a re&s;emblance betwixt natural and artificial &s;ounds, is &s;elf-evident;
<PB N="337" REF="338">
and that in fact there exi&s;t &s;uch re&s;emblances &s;ucce&s;sfully employ'd by writers of genius, is clear from the foregoing examples, and many others that might be given. But we may &s;afely pronounce, that this natural re|&s;emblance can be carried no farther. The objects of the &s;everal &s;en&s;es, differ &s;o widely from each other as to exclude any re&s;em|blance. Sound in particular, whether arti|culate or inarticulate, re&s;embles not in any degree ta&s;te, &s;mell, or motion; and as little can it re&s;emble any internal &s;entiment, feel|ing, or emotion. But mu&s;t we then agree, that nothing but natural &s;ound can be imi|tated by that which is articulate? Taking imitation in its proper &s;en&s;e, as involving a re&s;emblance betwixt two objects, the pro|po&s;ition mu&s;t be admitted. And yet in ma|ny pa&s;&s;ages that are not de&s;criptive of natu|ral &s;ound, every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a peculiar concord betwixt the &s;ound of the words and their meaning. As there can be no doubt of the fact, what remains is, to in|quire into its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Re&s;embling cau&s;es may produce effects that have no re&s;emblance; and cau&s;es that
<PB N="338" REF="339">
have no re&s;emblance may produce re&s;em|bling effects. A magnificent building, for example, re&s;embles not in any degree an he|roic action; and yet the emotions they pro|duce, being concordant, bear a re&s;emblance to each other. We are &s;till more &s;en&s;ible of this re&s;emblance, in a &s;ong where the mu&s;ic is properly adju&s;ted to the &s;entiment. There is no re&s;emblance betwixt thought and &s;ound; but there is the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;em|blance betwixt the emotion rai&s;ed by mu&s;ic tender and pathetic, and that rai&s;ed by the complaint of an un&s;ucce&s;sful lover. To ap|ply the&s;e examples to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I ob&s;erve, that the &s;ound even of a &s;ingle word makes, in &s;ome in&s;tances, an impre&s;&s;ion re&s;embling that which is made by the thing it &s;ignifies; witne&s;s the word <HI>running,</HI> com|po&s;ed of two &s;hort &s;yllables; and more re|markably the words <HI>rapidity, impetuo&s;ity, precipitation.</HI> Brutal manners produce in the &s;pectator, an emotion not unlike what is produced by a har&s;h and rough &s;ound. Hence the figurative expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>rugged</HI> manners; an expre&s;&s;ion peculiarly agreeable by the relation of the &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e.
<PB N="339" REF="340">
Again, the word <HI>little,</HI> being pronounced with a very &s;mall aperture of the mouth, has a weak and faint &s;ound, which makes an impre&s;&s;ion re&s;embling that made by any diminutive object. This re&s;emblance of ef|fects, is &s;till more remarkable where a num|ber of words are connected together in a period. Words pronounced in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion make often a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion; and when this impre&s;&s;ion happens to accord with that made by the &s;en&s;e, a peculiar plea&s;ure ari&s;es. The thought or &s;entiment produces one plea&s;ant emotion: the melody or tone of the words produces another. But the chief plea&s;ure proceeds from having the&s;e two concordant emotions combined in perfect harmony, and carried on in the mind to a full clo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>. Ex|cept in the &s;ingle ca&s;e where &s;ound is de|&s;cribed, all the examples given by critics of &s;en&s;e being imitated in &s;ound, re&s;olve into a re&s;emblance of effects. Emotions rai&s;ed by &s;ound and &s;ignification may have a re|&s;emblance; but &s;ound it&s;elf cannot have a re&s;emblance to any thing but &s;ound.</P>

Proceeding now to particulars, and be|ginning with tho&s;e ca&s;es where the emo|tions have the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;emblance, I ob|&s;erve, fir&s;t, That in pronouncing a number of &s;yllables in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, an emotion is &s;ometimes rai&s;ed extremely &s;imilar to that rai&s;ed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motion. This may be made evident even to tho&s;e who are defective in ta&s;te, by the following fact, that the term <HI>movement</HI> in all languages is equally apply'd to both. In this manner, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mo|tion, &s;uch as walking, running, galloping, can be imitated by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long or &s;hort &s;yllables, or by a due mixture of both. For example, &s;low motion may be aptly imitated in a ver&s;e where long &s;yllables pre|vail; e&s;pecially when aided by a &s;low pro|nunciation:
<Q>Illi inter &s;e&s;e magn&acirc; vi brachia tollunt.
<BIBL>Georg. iv. 174.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;wift motion is imi|tated by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;hort &s;yllables:
<Q>Quadrupedante putrem &s;onitu quatit ungula cam|pum.</Q>
<PB N="341" REF="342">
Again:
<Q>Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.</Q></P>
<P>Thirdly, a line compo&s;ed of mono&s;yl|lables, makes an impre&s;&s;ion, by the frequen|cy of its pau&s;es, &s;imilar to what is made by laborious interrupted motion:
<Q><L>With many a weary &s;tep, and many a groan,</L>
<L>Up the high hill he heaves a huge round &s;tone.</L>
<BIBL>Ody&s;&s;ey, xi. 736.</BIBL></Q><Q><L>Fir&s;t march the heavy mules, &s;ecurely &s;low;</L>
<L>O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er craggs, o'er rocks, they go.</L>
<BIBL>Iliad, xxiii. 138.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Fourthly, the impre&s;&s;ion made by rough &s;ounds in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, re&s;embles that made by rough or tumultuous motion. On the other hand, the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;mooth &s;ounds re&s;embles that of gentle motion. The fol|lowing is an example of both.
<Q><L>Two craggy rocks projecting to the main,</L>
<L>The roaring wind's tempe&s;tuous rage re&s;train;</L>
<L><PB N="342" REF="343">
Within, the waves in &s;ofter murmurs glide,</L>
<L>And &s;hips &s;ecure without their haul&s;ers ride.</L>
<BIBL>Ody&s;&s;ey, iii. 118.</BIBL></Q>
Another example of the latter:
<Q><L>Soft is the &s;train when Zephyr gently blows,</L>
<L>And the &s;mooth &s;tream in &s;moother numbers flows.</L>
<BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Crit. 366.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Fifthly, prolonged motion is expre&s;&s;ed in an Alexandrine line. The fir&s;t exam|ple &s;hall be of &s;low motion prolonged:
<Q><L>A needle&s;s Alexandrine ends the &s;ong;</L>
<L>That, like a wounded &s;nake, drags its &s;low length along.</L>
<BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Crit. 356.</BIBL></Q>
The next example is of forcible motion pro|longed:
<Q><L>The waves behind impel the waves before,</L>
<L>Wide-rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the &s;hore.</L>
<BIBL>Iliad, xiii. 1004.</BIBL></Q>
The la&s;t &s;hall be of rapid motion prolonged:
<Q><PB N="343" REF="344">
<L>Not &s;o when &s;wift Camilla &s;cours the plain,</L>
<L>Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and &s;kims along the main.</L>
<BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Crit. 373.</BIBL></Q>
Again, &s;peaking of a rock torn from the brow of a mountain,
<Q><L>Still gath'ring force, it &s;mokes, and, urg'd amain,</L>
<L>Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain.</L>
<BIBL>Iliad, xiii. 197.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Sixthly, a period con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of long &s;yllables, that is, of &s;yllables pronounced &s;low, produceth an emotion re&s;embling faintly that which is produced by gravity and &s;olemnity. Hence the beauty of the following ver&s;e.<Q>Olli &s;edato re&s;pondit corde Latinus.</Q></P>
<P>Seventhly, a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas is a circum&s;tance that belongs equally to &s;ettled melancholy, and to a period compo&s;ed of poly&s;yllables pronounced &s;low. Hence, by &s;imilarity of emotions, the latter is imitative of the former:
<Q><PB N="344" REF="345">
<L>In tho&s;e deep &s;olitudes and awful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly-pen&s;ive Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-mu&s;ing Melancholy reigns.</L>
<BIBL>Pope. Eloi&s;a to Abelard.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Eighthly, a long &s;yllable made &s;hort, or a &s;hort &s;yllable made long, rai&s;es, by the diffi|culty of pronouncing contrary to cu&s;tom, a feeling &s;imilar to that of hard labour:
<Q><L>When Ajax &s;trives &s;ome rock's <HI>va&s;t</HI> weight to throw,</L>
<L>The line too labours, and the words move &s;low.</L>
<BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Crit. 370.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Ninthly, har&s;h or rough words pronoun|ced with difficulty, excite a feeling re&s;em|bling that which proceeds from the labour of thought to a dull writer:
<Q><L>Ju&s;t writes to make his barrenne&s;s appear,</L>
<L>And &s;trains from hard-bound brains eight lines a|year.</L>
<BIBL>Pope's epi&s;tle to Dr Arbuthnot, l. 181.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e with one other example, which of all makes the fine&s;t figure. In the fir&s;t &s;ection mention is made of a climax in &s;ound, and in the &s;econd of a climax in
<PB N="345" REF="346">
&s;en&s;e. It belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject to ob&s;erve, that when the&s;e coincide in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, the concordance of &s;ound and &s;en&s;e is delightful. The reader is con&s;cious not only of plea&s;ure from the two climaxes &s;eparately, but of an additional plea&s;ure from their concordance, and from finding the &s;en&s;e &s;o ju&s;tly imitated by the &s;ound. In this re&s;pect, no periods are more perfect than tho&s;e borrowed from Cicero in the fir&s;t &s;ec|tion.</P>
<P>The concord betwixt &s;en&s;e and &s;ound is not le&s;s agreeable in what may be termed an <HI>anticlimax,</HI> where the progre&s;s is from great to little; for this has the effect to make di|minutive objects appear &s;till more diminu|tive. Horace affords a &s;triking example:
<Q>Parturiunt montes, na&s;cetur ridiculus mus.</Q>
The arrangement here is &s;ingularly artful. The fir&s;t place is occupied by the verb, which is the capital word by its &s;en&s;e as well as &s;ound. The clo&s;e is re&s;erved for the word that is the meane&s;t in &s;en&s;e as well as in &s;ound. And it mu&s;t not be overlooked,
<PB N="346" REF="347">
that the re&s;embling &s;ounds of the two la&s;t &s;yllables give a ludicrous air to the whole.</P>
<P>Reviewing the foregoing examples, it ap|pears to me, contrary to expectation, that in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;emblances to tho&s;e that are fainter, the plea&s;ure ri&s;es gradually in proportion. Can this be ac|counted for? or &s;hall I renounce my ta&s;te as capricious? When I renew the experi|ment again and again, I feel no wavering, but the greate&s;t plea&s;ure con&s;tantly from the fainte&s;t re&s;emblances. And yet how can this be? for if the plea&s;ure lie in imitation, mu&s;t not the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;emblance afford the greate&s;t plea&s;ure? From this vexing dilemma, I am happily relieved, by reflect|ing on a doctrine e&s;tabli&s;hed in the chapter of re&s;emblance and contra&s;t, that the plea|&s;ure of re&s;emblance is the greate&s;t, where it is lea&s;t expected, and where the objects compared are in their capital circum&s;tances widely different. Nor will this appear &s;ur|pri&s;ing, when we de&s;cend to familiar exam|ples. It rai&s;eth not wonder in the &s;malle&s;t degree, to find the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance betwixt two eggs of the &s;ame animal. It is
<PB N="347" REF="348">
more rare to find &s;uch re&s;emblance betwixt two human faces; and upon that account &s;uch an appearance rai&s;es &s;ome degree of wonder. But this emotion ri&s;es to a &s;till greater height, when we find in a pebble, an aggat, or any natural production, a per|fect re&s;emblance to a tree or other organi|&s;ed body. We cannot he&s;itate a moment, in applying the&s;e ob&s;ervations to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. What occa&s;ion of wonder can it be to find one &s;ound re&s;embling another, where both are of the &s;ame kind? It is not &s;o common to find a re&s;emblance betwixt an articulate &s;ound and one not articulate; and accordingly the imitation here affords &s;ome &s;light plea&s;ure. But the plea&s;ure &s;wells greatly, when we employ &s;ound to imitate things it re&s;embles not otherwi&s;e than by the effects produced in the mind.</P>
<P>I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that to complete the re&s;emblance betwixt &s;ound and &s;en&s;e, artful pronunciation contributes not a little. Pronunciation therefore may be con&s;idered as a branch of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and with &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon it I &s;hall conclude the &s;ection.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="349">
In order to give a ju&s;t idea of pronuncia|tion, it mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;inging. The latter is carried on by notes, requiring each of them a different aperture of the windpipe. The notes properly belonging to the former, are expre&s;&s;ed by different a|pertures of the mouth, without varying the aperture of the windpipe. This however doth not hinder pronunciation to borrow from &s;inging, as a man &s;ometimes is natu|rally led to do, in expre&s;&s;ing a vehement pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In reading, as in &s;inging, there is a key-note. Above this note the voice is fre|quently elevated, to make the &s;ound corre|&s;pond to the elevation of the &s;ubject. But the mind in an elevated &s;tate, is di&s;po&s;ed to action. Therefore in order to a re&s;t, it mu&s;t be brought down to the key-note. Hence the term <HI>cadence.</HI></P>
<P>The only general rule that can be given for directing the pronunciation, is, To &s;ound the words in &s;uch a manner as to imitate the things they repre&s;ent, or of which they are the &s;ymbols. The ideas which make the greate&s;t figure, ought to be expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="349" REF="350">
with a peculiar empha&s;is. In expre&s;&s;ing an elevated &s;ubject, the voice ought to be rai|&s;ed above its ordinary pitch; and words &s;ignifying dejection of mind, ought to be pronounced in a low note. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds gradually a&s;cending from low to high notes, repre&s;ents an a&s;cending &s;eries of objects. An oppo&s;ite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds, is fitted for objects or &s;entiments that de&s;cend gradually. In Dryden's ode of <HI>Alexander's fea&s;t,</HI> the line, <HI>Faln, faln, faln, faln,</HI> ought to be pronounced with a falling voice; and is pronounced in that manner, by every one of ta&s;te, without in|&s;truction. Another circum&s;tance contri|butes to the re&s;emblance betwixt &s;en&s;e and &s;ound, which is &s;low or quick pronuncia|tion. For though the length or &s;hortne&s;s of the &s;yllables with relation to each other, be in pro&s;e a&s;certained in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and in ver&s;e always; yet taking a whole line or period together, it is arbitrary to pronounce it &s;low or fa&s;t. Hence it is, that a period expre&s;&s;ing what is &s;olemn or deli|berate, ought to be pronounced &s;low; and ought to be pronounced quick, when it ex|pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="350" REF="351">
any thing bri&s;k, lively, or impe|tuous.</P>
<P>The art of pronouncing with propriety and grace, being calculated to make the &s;ound an echo to the &s;en&s;e, &s;carce admits of any other general rule than that above mentioned. This rule may indeed be branched out into many particular rules and ob&s;ervations: but the&s;e belong not properly to the pre&s;ent undertaking, becau&s;e they cannot be explained in words. We have not words to &s;ignify the different degrees of high and low, loud and &s;oft, fa&s;t and &s;low; and before the&s;e differences can be made the &s;ubject of regular in&s;truction, notes mu&s;t be invented re&s;embling tho&s;e employ'd in mu&s;ic. We have rea&s;on to believe, that in Greece every tragedy was accompanied with &s;uch notes, in order to a&s;certain the pronunciation. But the moderns hitherto have not thought of this refinement. Ci|cero indeed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De oratore, l. 3. cap. 58.</NOTE>, without the help of notes, pretends to give rules for a&s;certaining the &s;everal tones of voice that are proper in ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="351" REF="352">
the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that in this attempt he has exhau&s;ted the whole power of lan|guage. At the &s;ame time, every per&s;on of judgement mu&s;t &s;ee, that the&s;e rules a|vail little in point of in&s;truction. The very words he employs, are &s;carce intelli|gible, except to tho&s;e who beforehand are acquainted with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To vary the &s;cene a little, I propo&s;e to clo&s;e with a &s;light compari&s;on betwixt &s;ing|ing and pronouncing. In this compari&s;on the five following circum&s;tances relative to articulate &s;ound, mu&s;t be kept in view. 1&s;t, It is har&s;h or &s;mooth. 2d, A &s;ound or &s;yllable, is long or &s;hort. 3d, It is pronounced high or low. 4th, It is pro|nounced loud or &s;oft. And, la&s;tly, a num|ber of words in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con&s;tituting a pe|riod or member of a period, are pronoun|ced &s;low or quick. Of the&s;e five, the fir&s;t depending on the component letters, and the &s;econd being a&s;certained by cu&s;tom, admit not any variety in pronouncing. The three la&s;t are arbitrary, depending on the will of the per&s;on who pronounces;
<PB N="352" REF="353">
and it is chiefly in the artful management of the&s;e, that ju&s;t pronunciation con&s;i&s;ts. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t circum&s;tance, mu|&s;ic has evidently the advantage; for all its notes are agreeable to the ear, which is not always the ca&s;e of articulate &s;ound. With re&s;pect to the &s;econd, long and &s;hort &s;yl|lables variou&s;ly combined, produce a great variety of feet; yet far inferior to the varie|ty which is found in the multiplied com|binations of mu&s;ical notes. With re&s;pect to high and low notes, pronunciation is &s;till more inferior to &s;inging. For it it ob&s;er|ved by Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De &s;tructura orationis, &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>, that in pronouncing, <HI>i. e.</HI> without altering the aperture of the windpipe, the voice is con|fined within three notes and a half. Sing|ing has a much greater compa&s;s. With re&s;pect to the two la&s;t circum&s;tances, pro|nunciation equals &s;inging.</P>
<P>In this di&s;cour&s;e, I have mentioned none of the beauties of language, but what ari&s;e
<PB N="353" REF="354">
from words taken in their proper &s;en&s;e. Tho&s;e beauties that depend on the meta|phorical and figurative power of words, are re&s;erved to be treated in chap. 20.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. VERSIFICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE mu&s;ic of ver&s;e, though handled by every grammarian, merits more attention than has been given it. The &s;ub|ject is intimately connected with human nature; and to explain it thoroughly, &s;eve|ral nice and delicate feelings mu&s;t be em|ploy'd. Entering upon this &s;ubject, it oc|curs as a preliminary point, By what mark is ver&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed from pro&s;e? The di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of this point is nece&s;&s;ary, were it for no other purpo&s;e but to a&s;certain the nature and limits of our &s;ubject. To produce this di&s;tingui&s;hing mark, is a ta&s;k not perhaps &s;o ea&s;y as may at fir&s;t be apprehended. Ver&s;e of every &s;ort, has, it is true, rules for
<PB N="354" REF="355">
its con&s;truction. It is compo&s;ed of feet, the number and variety of which are a&s;cer|tained. Pro&s;e, though al&s;o compo&s;ed of feet, is more loo&s;e and &s;carce &s;ubjected to any rules. But many are ignorant of the&s;e rules: Are &s;uch left without means to make the di&s;tinction? And even with re&s;pect to the learned, mu&s;t they apply the rule be|fore they can with certainty pronounce whether the compo&s;ition be pro&s;e or ver&s;e? This will hardly be maintained; and there|fore, in&s;tead of rules, the ear mu&s;t be ap|pealed to as the proper judge. But what gain we by being thus referred to another &s;tandard? It &s;till recurs, by what mark does the ear di&s;tingui&s;h ver&s;e from pro&s;e? The proper and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer is, That the&s;e make different impre&s;&s;ions, which are readily di&s;tingui&s;hable by every one who hath an ear. This advances us one &s;tep in our inquiry.</P>
<P>Taking it then for granted, that ver&s;e makes upon the ear a different impre&s;&s;ion from that of pro&s;e; nothing remains but to explain this difference, and to a&s;&s;ign its cau&s;e. To the&s;e ends, I mu&s;t call to my
<PB N="355" REF="356">
aid an ob&s;ervation made above in treating of the &s;ound of words, that they are more agreeable to the ear when compo&s;ed of long and &s;hort &s;yllables than when all the &s;ylla|bles are of the &s;ame &s;ort. A continued &s;ound in the &s;ame tone, makes an impre&s;|&s;ion that comes not up to any idea we have of mu&s;ic. The &s;ame note &s;ucce&s;&s;ively re|newed by intervals, is more agreeable; but &s;till makes not a mu&s;ical impre&s;&s;ion. To produce this impre&s;&s;ion, variety is nece&s;&s;ary as well as number. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ounds or &s;yllables, mu&s;t be &s;ome of them long, &s;ome of them &s;hort; and if al&s;o high and low, the mu&s;ic is the more perfect. Now if this impre&s;&s;ion can be made by &s;ingle words, much more by a plurality in an or|derly &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The mu&s;ical impre&s;&s;ion made by a period con&s;i&s;ting of long and &s;hort &s;yllables arranged in a certain order, is what the Greeks call <HI>rhythmus,</HI> the La|tins, <HI>numerus,</HI> and we <HI>modulation</HI> or <HI>mea|&s;ure.</HI> Cicero ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that in one continued &s;ound there is no modulation: <Q REND="inline">"Numerus in continuatione nullus e&s;t."</Q> But in what follows he is wide of the truth,
<PB N="356" REF="357">
if by <HI>numerus</HI> he means modulation or mu|&s;ical mea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">"Di&s;tinctio, et aequalium et &s;aepe variorum intervallorum percu&s;&s;io, numerum conficit; quem in cadentibus guttis, quod intervallis di&s;tinguuntur, notare po&s;&s;umus."</Q> Falling drops, whe|ther with equal or unequal intervals, are certainly not mu&s;ical. We begin then only to be &s;en&s;ible of a mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, when the notes are varied. And this al&s;o was probably the opinion of the author ci|ted, though his expre&s;&s;ion be a little un|guarded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this pa&s;&s;age, however, we di&s;cover the etymology of the Latin term for mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion. Every one being &s;en&s;ible that there is no mu&s;ic in a continued &s;ound; the fir&s;t inquiries were probably carried no farther, than that to produce a mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, a number of &s;ounds is nece&s;&s;ary; and mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion obtained the name of <HI>numerus,</HI> before it was clearly a&s;certained, that variety is nece&s;&s;ary as well as number.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It will probably occur, that modulation, &s;o far as connected with long and &s;hort &s;yllables combined in a &s;entence, may be found in pro&s;e as well as in ver&s;e; con&s;i|dering e&s;pecially, that in both, particular words are accented or pronounced in a
<PB N="357" REF="358">
higher tone than ordinary; and therefore that the difference betwixt them cannot con&s;i&s;t in modulation merely. The ob&s;er|vation is ju&s;t; and it follows, that the di&s;|tinction betwixt pro&s;e and ver&s;e, &s;ince it depends not on modulation merely, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the difference of the modula|tion. This is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e, though the difference cannot with any accuracy be explained in words. Ver&s;e is more mu&s;i|cal than pro&s;e; and of the former, the modulation is more perfect than of the latter. The difference betwixt ver&s;e and pro&s;e, re|&s;embles the difference in mu&s;ic properly &s;o called betwixt the &s;ong and the recitative. And the re&s;emblance is not the le&s;s com|plete, that the&s;e differences, like the &s;hades of colours, approximate &s;ometimes &s;o near|ly as &s;carce to be di&s;cernible. A recitative in its movement approaches &s;ometimes to the liveline&s;s of a &s;ong; which on the o|ther hand degenerates &s;ometimes toward a plain recitative. Nothing is more di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from pro&s;e, than the bulk of Virgil's hexameters. Many of tho&s;e com|po&s;ed
<PB N="358" REF="359">
by Horace, are very little removed from pro&s;e. Sapphic ver&s;e has a very &s;en|&s;ible modulation. That on the other hand of an Iambic, is extremely faint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mu&s;ic, properly &s;o called, is analy&s;ed into melody and harmony. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds &s;o as to be agreeable to the ear, con&s;titutes melody. Harmony is the plea&s;ure that ari&s;es from co-exi&s;ting &s;ounds. Ver&s;e therefore can only reach me|lody, and not harmony.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This more perfect modulation of articu|late &s;ounds, is what di&s;tingui&s;heth ver&s;e from pro&s;e. Ver&s;e is &s;ubjected to certain inflex|ible laws. The number and variety of the component &s;yllables are a&s;certained, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Such re&s;traint makes it a matter of difficulty to compo&s;e in ver&s;e; a difficulty that is not to be &s;urmounted but by a &s;ingular genius. U&s;eful le&s;&s;ons of every &s;ort convey'd to us in ver&s;e, are agreeable by the union of mu|&s;ic with in&s;truction. But are we for that rea&s;on to reject knowledge offered in a plain|er dre&s;s? This would be ridiculous; for knowledge may be acquired without mu&s;ic, and mu&s;ic is entertaining independent of knowledge. Many there are, not le&s;s will|ing
<PB N="359" REF="360">
than capable to in&s;truct us, who have no genius for ver&s;e. Hence the u&s;e of pro&s;e, which, for the rea&s;on now given, is not confined to preci&s;e rules. There belongs to it, a certain modulation of an inferior kind, which, being extremely ornamental, ought to be the aim of every writer. But to &s;ucceed in it, practice is nece&s;&s;ary more than genius. Nor are we rigid on this article. Provided the work an&s;wer its chief end of in&s;truction, we are the le&s;s &s;olicitous about its dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having a&s;certained the nature and limits of our &s;ubject, I proceed to the laws by which it is regulated. The&s;e would be endle&s;s, were ver&s;e of all different kinds to be taken under con&s;ideration. I propo&s;e therefore to confine the inquiry, to Latin or Greek hexameter, and to French and Eng|li&s;h heroic ver&s;e; which perhaps will carry me farther than the reader may chu&s;e to fol|low. The ob&s;ervations I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to make, will at any rate be &s;ufficient for a &s;pecimen; and the&s;e with proper va|riations may ea&s;ily be transferred to the compo&s;ition of other &s;orts of ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon particulars, it mu&s;t
<PB N="360" REF="361">
be premi&s;ed in general, that to ver&s;e of eve|ry kind, five things are of importance. 1&s;t, The number of &s;yllables that compo&s;e a ver&s;e. 2d, The different lengths of &s;yl|lables, <HI>i. e.</HI> the difference of time taken in pronouncing. 3d, The arrangement of the&s;e &s;yllables combined in words. 4th, The pau&s;es or &s;tops in pronouncing. 5th, Pronouncing &s;yllables in a high or low tone. The three fir&s;t mentioned are obviou&s;ly e&s;|&s;ential to ver&s;e. If any of them be wanting, there cannot be that higher degree of mo|dulation which di&s;tingui&s;heth ver&s;e from pro&s;e. To give a ju&s;t notion of the fourth, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that pau&s;es are nece&s;|&s;ary for three different purpo&s;es. One is, to &s;eparate periods and members of the &s;ame period according to the &s;en&s;e: another is, to improve the modulation of ver&s;e: and the la&s;t is, to afford opportunity for drawing breath in reading. A pau&s;e of the fir&s;t kind is variable, being long or &s;hort, frequent or le&s;s frequent, as the &s;en&s;e requires. A pau&s;e of the &s;econd kind, is in no degree arbitrary; its place being determined by the modulation. The la&s;t &s;ort again is in a
<PB N="361" REF="362">
mea&s;ure arbitrary, depending on the read|er's command of breath. This &s;ort ought always to coincide with the fir&s;t or &s;econd; for one cannot read with grace, unle&s;s, for drawing breath, opportunity be taken of a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e or in the melody; and for that rea&s;on this pau&s;e may be neglected. With re&s;pect then to the pau&s;es of &s;en&s;e and of melody, it may be affirmed without he|&s;itation, that their coincidence in ver&s;e is a capital beauty. But as it cannot be expect|ed, in a long work e&s;pecially, that every line &s;hould be &s;o perfect; we &s;hall after|ward have occa&s;ion to &s;ee, that the pau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for &s;en&s;e mu&s;t often, in &s;ome de|gree, be &s;acrificed to the ver&s;e-pau&s;e; and the latter &s;ometimes to the former.</P>
<P>The pronouncing &s;yllables in a high or low tone, contributes al&s;o to melody. In reading, whether ver&s;e or pro&s;e, a certain tone is a&s;&s;umed, which may be called <HI>the key-note</HI>; and in this tone the bulk of the words are &s;ounded. Sometimes to humour the &s;en&s;e and &s;ometimes the melody, a parti|cular &s;yllable is &s;ounded in a higher tone; and this is termed <HI>accenting a &s;yllable,</HI> or gracing
<PB N="362" REF="363">
it with an accent. Oppo&s;ed to the accent, is the cadence, which I have not mentioned as one of the requi&s;ites of ver&s;e, becau&s;e it is entirely regulated by the &s;en&s;e, and hath no peculiar relation to ver&s;e. The cadence is a falling of the voice below the key-note at the clo&s;e of every period; and &s;o little is it e&s;&s;ential to ver&s;e, that in correct reading the final &s;yllable of every line is accent|ed, that &s;yllable only excepted which clo&s;es the period, where the &s;en&s;e requires a cadence. The reader may be &s;atisfied of this by experiments; and for that purpo&s;e I recommend to him the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> which, in point of ver&s;ification, is the mo&s;t complete performance in the Engli&s;h lan|guage. Let him con&s;ult in particular a pe|riod canto 2. beginning at line 47. and clo&s;ed line 52. with the word <HI>gay,</HI> which only of the whole final &s;yllables is pronoun|ced with a cadence. He may al&s;o examine another period in the 5th canto, which runs from line 45. to line 52.</P>
<P>Though the five requi&s;ites above mention|ed, enter the compo&s;ition of every &s;pecies of ver&s;e, they are however governed by differ|ent
<PB N="363" REF="364">
rules, peculiar to each &s;pecies. Upon quantity only, one general ob&s;ervation may be premi&s;ed, becau&s;e it is applicable to eve|ry &s;pecies of ver&s;e. Syllables, with re&s;pect to the time taken in pronouncing, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into long and &s;hort; two &s;hort &s;yl|lables, with re&s;pect to time, being preci&s;ely equal to one long. The&s;e two lengths are e&s;&s;ential to ver&s;e of all kinds; and to no ver&s;e, &s;o far as I know, is a greater variety of time nece&s;&s;ary in pronouncing &s;yllables. The voice indeed is frequently made to re&s;t longer than commonly, upon a word that bears an important &s;ignification. But this is done to humour the &s;en&s;e, and is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the modulation. A thing not more nece&s;&s;ary occurs with re&s;pect to ac|centing, &s;imilar to that now mentioned. A word &s;ignifying any thing humble, low, or dejected, is naturally, in pro&s;e as well as in ver&s;e, pronounced in a tone below the key|note.</P>
<P>We are now &s;ufficiently prepared for en|tering upon particulars; and Latin or Greek Hexameter, which are the &s;ame, coming fir&s;t in order, I &s;hall exhau&s;t what I have to
<PB N="364" REF="365">
&s;ay upon this &s;pecies of ver&s;e, under the four following heads; of number, arrange|ment, pau&s;e, and accent; for as to quanti|ty, &s;o far as concerns the pre&s;ent point, what is ob&s;erved above may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Hexameter lines are, with re&s;pect to time, all of the &s;ame length. A line may con&s;i&s;t of &s;eventeen &s;yllables; and when regular and not Spondaic, it never has fewer than thirteen. Hence it is plain, that where the &s;yllables are many, the plurality mu&s;t be &s;hort; where few, the plurality mu&s;t be long. And upon the whole, the number of &s;yllables in every line with re&s;pect to the time taken in pronouncing, are equivalent to twelve long &s;yllables, or twenty-four &s;hort.</P>
<P>With regard to arrangement, this line is &s;u&s;ceptible of much variety. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yllables, may be great|ly varied without injuring the melody. It is &s;ubjected however to laws, that confine its variety within certain limits. For trying the arrangement, and for determining whe|ther it be perfect or faulty, grammarians have invented a rule by Dactyles and Spon|dees,
<PB N="365" REF="366">
which they denominate <HI>feet.</HI> One at fir&s;t view is led to think, that the&s;e feet are al&s;o intended to regulate the pronunciation. But this is far from being the ca&s;e. It will appear by and by, that the rules of pronun|ciation are very different. And indeed were one to pronounce according to the&s;e feet, the melody of a Hexameter line would be de&s;troy'd, or at be&s;t be much inferior to what it is when properly pronounced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>After &s;ome attention given to this &s;ubject, and weighing deliberately every circum&s;tance, I have been forc'd to re&s;t up|on the foregoing conclu&s;ion, That the Dactyle and Spondee are no other than artificial mea&s;ures invented for trying the accu|racy of compo&s;ition. Repeated experiments convince me, that though the &s;en&s;e &s;hould be altogether neglected, an Hex|ameter line read by Dactyles and Spondees, will not be me|lodious. And the compo&s;ition of an Hexameter line demon|&s;trates this to be true, without nece&s;&s;ity of an experiment. It will appear afterward, that in an Hexameter line, there mu&s;t always be a capital pau&s;e at the end of the fifth long &s;yllable, reckoning, as above, two &s;hort for one long. And when we mea&s;ure this line by Dactyles and Spondees, the pau&s;e now mentioned divides always a Dactyle or a Spondee: it never falls in at the end of either of the&s;e feet. Hence it is evident, that if a line be pronounced, as it is &s;canned, by Dactyles and Spondees, the pau&s;e mu&s;t be utterly neglected; which con&s;e|quently mu&s;t de&s;troy the melody, becau&s;e a pau&s;e is e&s;&s;ential to the melody of an Hexameter ver&s;e. If, on the other hand, the melody be pre&s;erved by making this pau&s;e, the pronoun|cing by Dactyles and Spondees mu&s;t be abandoned.</P>
<P>What has led grammarians into the u&s;e of Dactyles and Spondees, &s;eems not beyond the reach of conjecture. To produce melody, the latter part of a Hexameter line con&s;i&s;t|ing of a Dactyle and a Spondee, mu&s;t be read according to the&s;e feet: in this part of the line, the Dactyle and Spondee are di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed in the pronunciation. This di&s;covery, joined with another, that the foregoing part of the ver&s;e could be mea&s;ured by the &s;ame feet, has led grammarians to adopt the&s;e artificial mea&s;ures, and perhaps ra&s;hly to conclude, that the pronunciation is directed by the&s;e feet as well as the com|po&s;ition. The Dactyle and Spondee at the clo&s;e, &s;erve indeed the double purpo&s;e of regulating the pronunciation as well as the compo&s;ition: but in the foregoing part of the line, they regulate the compo&s;ition only, not the pronunciation.</P>
<P>If we mu&s;t have feet in ver&s;e to regulate the pronunciation, and con&s;equently the melody, the&s;e feet mu&s;t be determined by the pau&s;es. The whole &s;yllables interjected betwixt two pau&s;es ought to be deemed one mu&s;ical foot; becau&s;e, to pre|&s;erve the melody, they mu&s;t all be pronounced together, with|out any &s;top. And therefore, whatever number there are of pau&s;es in a Hexameter line, the parts into which it is divided by the&s;e pau&s;es, make ju&s;t &s;o many mu&s;ical feet.</P>
<P>Connection obliges me here to anticipate, by ob&s;erving, that the &s;ame doctrine is applicable to Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e. Con|&s;idering its compo&s;ition merely, it is of two kinds. One is compo&s;ed of five Iambi; and one of a Trochaeus followed by four Iambi. But the&s;e feet afford no rule for pronouncing. The mu&s;ical feet are obviou&s;ly tho&s;e parts of the line that are inter|jected betwixt two pau&s;es. To bring out the melody, the&s;e feet mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed in the pronunciation; or, which comes to the &s;ame, the pronunciation mu&s;t be directed by the pau&s;es, without regard to the Iambus or Trochaeus.</P></NOTE>. The&s;e feet then mu&s;t be confined to their
<PB N="366" REF="367">
&s;ole province of regulating the arrangement, for they &s;erve no other purpo&s;e. They are withal &s;o artificial and complex, that, neg|lecting them altogether, I am tempted to &s;ub&s;titute in their room, other rules, more &s;imple and of more ea&s;y application; for example, the following. 1&s;t, The line mu&s;t always commence with a long &s;yllable, and clo&s;e with two long preceded by two &s;hort. 2d, More than two &s;hort can never be
<PB N="367" REF="368">
found in any part of the line, nor fewer than two if any. And, 3d, Two long &s;yl|lables which have been preceded by two &s;hort, cannot al&s;o be followed by two &s;hort. The&s;e few rules fulfil all the conditions of a Hexameter line, with relation to order or arrangement. To the&s;e again a &s;ingle rule may be &s;ub&s;tituted, for which I have a &s;till greater reli&s;h, as it regulates more affirma|tively the con&s;truction of every part. That I may put this rule into words with the
<PB N="368" REF="369">
greater facility, I take a hint from the twelve long &s;yllables that compo&s;e an Hex|ameter line, to divide it into twelve equal parts or portions, being each of them one long &s;yllable or two &s;hort. This prelimi|nary being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the rule is &s;hortly what follows. The 1&s;t, 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 12th portions, mu&s;t each of them be one long &s;yllable; the 10th mu&s;t always be two &s;hort &s;yllables; the 2d, 4th, 6th, and 8th, may indifferently be one long or two &s;hort. Or to expre&s;s the thing &s;till more curtly, The 2d, 4th, 6th, and 8th portions may be one long &s;yl|lable or two &s;hort; the 10th mu&s;t be two &s;hort &s;yllables; all the re&s;t mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of one long &s;yllable. This fulfils all the con|ditions of an Hexameter line, and compre|hends all the combinations of Dactyles and Spondees that this line admits.</P>
<P>Next in order comes the pau&s;e. At the end of every Hexameter line, no ear but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a complete clo&s;e or full pau&s;e. This effect is produced by the fol|lowing
<PB N="369" REF="370">
means. Every line invariably is fi|ni&s;hed with two long &s;yllables preceded by two &s;hort; a fine preparation for a full clo&s;e. Syllables pronounced &s;low, re&s;emble a &s;low and languid motion tending to re&s;t. The mind put in the &s;ame tone by the pronun|ciation, is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to a pau&s;e. And to this di&s;po&s;ition the two preceding &s;hort &s;yllables contribute; for the&s;e, by contra&s;t, make the &s;low pronunciation of the final &s;yllables the more con&s;picuous. Be&s;ide this complete clo&s;e or full pau&s;e at the end, others are al&s;o requi&s;ite for the &s;ake of me|lody. I di&s;cover two clearly, and perhaps there may be more. The longe&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable, &s;ucceeds the 5th portion, ac|cording to the foregoing mea&s;ure. The other, which being more faint, may be called <HI>the &s;emipau&s;e,</HI> &s;ucceeds the 8th por|tion. So &s;triking is the pau&s;e fir&s;t mention|ed, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed even by the rude&s;t ear. The monki&s;h rhymes are evi|dently built upon it. In the&s;e, it is an in|variable rule, to make the final word chime with that which immediately precedes the pau&s;e:
<Q><PB N="370" REF="371">
<L>De planctu cudo &Verbar; mitrum cum carmine nudo</L>
<L>Mingere cum bumbis &Verbar; res e&s;t &s;oluberrima lumbis.</L></Q></P>
<P>The difference of time in the pau&s;e and &s;emipau&s;e, occa&s;ions another difference not le&s;s remarkable. The pau&s;e ought regu|larly to be at the end of a word; but it is lawful to divide a word by a &s;emipau&s;e. The bad effect of dividing a word by the pau&s;e, is &s;en&s;ibly felt in the following ex|amples.

The rea&s;on of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, will be e|vident upon the &s;lighte&s;t reflection. Be|twixt things &s;o intimately connected as &s;en&s;e and &s;ound in pronunciation, to find di&s;|cordance is unplea&s;ant to the ear; and for that rea&s;on, it is a matter of importance, to make the mu&s;ical pau&s;es coincide as much as po&s;&s;ible with tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;e. This is requi&s;ite, more e&s;pecially, with re&s;pect
<PB N="372" REF="373">
to the pau&s;e. A deviation from the rule is le&s;s remarkable in a &s;emipau&s;e, which makes but a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion. Con&s;i|dering the matter as to modulation &s;olely, it is indifferent whether the pau&s;es be at the end of words or in the middle. But when we carry the &s;en&s;e along, nothing is more di&s;agreeable than to find a word &s;plit into two parts, neither of which &s;eparately have any meaning. This bad effect, though it regard the &s;en&s;e only, is by an ea&s;y tran&s;|ition of ideas transferred to the &s;ound, with which the &s;en&s;e is intimately connect|ed; and by this means, we conceive a line to be har&s;h and grating to the ear, which in reality is only &s;o to the under&s;tanding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the rule which places the pau&s;e after the 5th portion, there is one exception, and no more. If the &s;yllable &s;ucceeding the 5th portion be &s;hort, the pau&s;e is &s;ometimes po&s;tponed to it:

<P>If this pau&s;e, po&s;tponed as afore&s;aid to the &s;hort &s;yllable, happen al&s;o to divide a word, the melody by the&s;e circum&s;tances is totally annihilated: witne&s;s the following line of Ennius, which is plain pro&s;e.<Q><L>Romae moenia terru&Verbar;it impiger &verbar; Hannibal armis</L></Q></P>
<P>Hitherto the arrangement of the long and &s;hort &s;yllables of an Hexameter line and
<PB N="374" REF="375">
its different pau&s;es, have been con&s;idered with re&s;pect to melody. But to have a ju&s;t notion of Hexameter ver&s;e, the&s;e particulars mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;idered with re&s;pect to &s;en&s;e. There is not perhaps in any other &s;ort of ver&s;e, &s;uch a latitude in the long and &s;hort &s;yllables. This circum&s;tance contributes greatly to that richne&s;s of modulation which is remarkable in Hexameter ver&s;e; and which makes Ari&s;totle pronounce, that an epic poem in any other &s;ort would not &s;ucceed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poet. cap. 25.</NOTE>. One defect however mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled. The &s;ame means that con|tribute to the richne&s;s of the melody, ren|der it le&s;s fit than &s;everal other &s;orts for a narrative poem. With regard to the melo|dy, as above ob&s;erved, there cannot be a more artful contrivance than to clo&s;e an Hexameter line with two long &s;yllables pre|ceded by two &s;hort. But unhappily this con&s;truction proves a great imbarra&s;&s;ment to the &s;en&s;e; as will be evident from what follows. As in general there ought to be a &s;trict concordance betwixt every thought
<PB N="375" REF="376">
and the words in which it is dre&s;&s;ed, &s;o in particular, every clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e, com|plete and incomplete, ought to be accom|panied with a &s;imilar clo&s;e in the &s;ound. In the compo&s;ition of pro&s;e, there is &s;uffi|cient latitude for applying this rule in the &s;tricte&s;t manner. But the &s;ame &s;trictne&s;s in ver&s;e, would occa&s;ion in&s;uperable difficul|ties. Some &s;hare of the concordance be|twixt thought and expre&s;&s;ion, may be ju&s;t|ly &s;acrificed to the melody of ver&s;e; and therefore during the cour&s;e of a line, we freely excu&s;e the want of coincidence of the mu&s;ical pau&s;e with that of the &s;en&s;e. But the clo&s;e of an Hexameter line is too con&s;picuous to admit a total neglect of this coincidence. And hence it follows, that there ought to be always &s;ome pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e at the end of every Hexameter line, were it but &s;uch a pau&s;e as is marked with a comma. It follows al&s;o, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, that there ought never to be a full clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e but at the end of a line, becau&s;e there the modulation is clo&s;ed. An Hexameter line, to pre&s;erve its melody, cannot well permit any greater relaxation;
<PB N="376" REF="377">
and yet in a narrative poem, it is extremely difficult to keep up to the rule even with the&s;e indulgences. Virgil, the greate&s;t poet for ver&s;ification that ever exi&s;ted, is forc'd often to end a line without any clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e, and as often to clo&s;e the &s;en&s;e during the running of a line: though a clo&s;e in the melody during the movement of the thought, or a clo&s;e in the thought during the movement of the melody, can|not fail to be di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The accent, to which we proceed, is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than the other circum&s;tances a|bove handled. By a good ear it will be di&s;cerned, that in every line there is one &s;yllable di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t by a &s;trong accent. This &s;yllable making the 7th portion, is invariably long; and in point of time occupies a place nearly at an equal di&s;tance from the pau&s;e which &s;uc|ceeds the 5th portion, and the &s;emipau&s;e, which &s;ucceeds the 8th:

<P>In the&s;e examples, the accent is laid upon the la&s;t &s;yllable of a word. And that this is a favourable circum&s;tance for the melody, will appear from the following con&s;ideration. In reading, there mu&s;t be &s;ome pau&s;e after every word, to &s;eparate it from what follows; and this pau&s;e, however &s;hort, &s;upports the accent. Hence it is, that a line thus accented, has a more &s;pirited air, than where the accent is placed on any other &s;yllable. Compare the fore|going lines with the following.

In lines where the pau&s;e comes after the &s;hort &s;yllable &s;ucceeding the 5th portion, the accent is di&s;placed and rendered le&s;s &s;en&s;ible. It &s;eems to be &s;plit into two, and to be laid partly on the 5th portion, and partly on the 7th, its u&s;ual place; as in

<P>Be&s;ide this capital accent, &s;lighter ac|cents are laid upon other portions; particu|larly upon the 4th, unle&s;s where it con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;hort &s;yllables; upon the 9th, which is always a long &s;yllable; and upon the 11th, where the line concludes with a mo|no&s;yllable. Such conclu&s;ion, by the by, le&s;&s;ens the melody, and for that rea&s;on is not to be indulged unle&s;s where it is expre&s;|&s;ive of the &s;en&s;e. The following lines are marked with all the accents.

<P>Inquiring into the melody of Hexameter ver&s;e, we &s;oon di&s;cover, that order or ar|rangement doth not con&s;titute the whole of it. Comparing different lines, equally re|gular as to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yllables, the melody is found in very differ|ent degrees of perfection. Nor does the difference ari&s;e from any particular combi|nation of Dactyles and Spondees, or of long and &s;hort &s;yllables. On the contrary, we find lines where Dactyles prevail and lines where Spondees prevail, equally melodious. Of the former take the following in&s;tance:
<Q><L>Aeneadum genetrix hominum divumque voluptas.</L></Q>
Of the latter:
<Q><L>Molli paulatim flave&s;cet campus ari&s;ta.</L></Q>
What can be more different as to melody
<PB N="380" REF="381">
than the two following lines, which, how|ever, as to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yllables, are con&s;tructed preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner?
<Q><L>Ad ta<ABOVE>Spond.</ABOVE>los &s;tola<ABOVE>Dact.</ABOVE> dimi&s;<ABOVE>Spond.</ABOVE>&s;a et cir<ABOVE>Spond.</ABOVE>cumdata<ABOVE>Dact.</ABOVE> palla.<ABOVE>Spond.</ABOVE></L> <BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q>

In the former, the pau&s;e falls in the mid|dle of a word, which is a great blemi&s;h, and the accent is di&s;turbed by a har&s;h eli&s;ion of the vowel <HI>a</HI> upon the particle <HI>et.</HI> In the latter the pau&s;es and the accent are all of them di&s;tinct and full: there is no eli&s;ion: and the words are more liquid and &s;ound|ing. In the&s;e particulars con&s;i&s;ts the beauty of an Hexameter line with re&s;pect to melo|dy; and by neglecting the&s;e, many lines in the Satires and Epi&s;tles of Horace are le&s;s agreeable than plain pro&s;e; for they are neither the one nor the other in perfection. To make the&s;e lines &s;ound, they mu&s;t be pronounced without relation to the &s;en&s;e. It mu&s;t not be regarded, that words are di|vided
<PB N="381" REF="382">
by pau&s;es, nor that har&s;h eli&s;ions are multiplied. To add to the account, pro&s;aic low &s;ounding words are introduced; and which is &s;till wor&s;e, accents are laid on them. Of &s;uch faulty lines take the following in|&s;tances.<Q><L>Candida rectaque &s;it, munda hactenus &s;it neque longa.</L>
<L>Jupiter exclamat &s;imul atque audirit; at in &s;e</L>

<L>Nunc illud tantum quaeram, meritone tibi &s;it.</L></Q></P>
<P>Next in order comes Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e, which &s;hall be examined under the whole five heads, of number, quantity, arrange|ment, pau&s;e, and accent. This ver&s;e &s;ome|times employs rhymes and &s;ometimes not, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it into two kinds; one named <HI>metre,</HI> and one <HI>blank ver&s;e.</HI> In the former, the lines are connected two and two by &s;imilarity of &s;ound in the final &s;ylla|bles; and &s;uch connected lines are termed <HI>couplets.</HI> Similarity of &s;ound being avoided in the latter, bani&s;hes couplets. The&s;e two &s;orts mu&s;t be handled &s;eparately, becau&s;e there
<PB N="382" REF="383">
are many peculiarities in each. The fir&s;t article with re&s;pect to rhyme or metre, &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a few words. Every line con&s;i&s;ts of ten &s;yllables, five &s;hort and five long. There are but two exceptions, both of them rare. A couplet can bear to be drawn out, by adding a &s;hort &s;yllable at the end of each of the two lines:
<Q><L>There hero's wits are kept in pond'rous va&s;es,</L>
<L>And beau's in &s;nuff-boxes and tweezer-ca&s;es.</L></Q><Q><L>The piece, you think, is incorrect? Why, take it;</L>
<L>I'm all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; what you'd have it, make it.</L></Q>
This licence is &s;ufferable in a &s;ingle couplet;
but if frequent would &s;oon become di&s;gu&s;t|ful.</P>
<P>The other exception concerns the &s;econd line of a couplet, which is &s;ometimes &s;tretched out to twelve &s;yllables, termed an <HI>Alexandrine line.</HI>
<Q><L>A needle&s;s Alexandrine ends the &s;ong,</L>
<L>That, like a wounded &s;nake, drags its &s;low length along.</L></Q>
<PB N="383" REF="384">
It doth extremely well when employ'd to clo&s;e a period with a certain pomp and &s;o|lemnity &s;uitable to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd article, it is un|nece&s;&s;ary to mention a &s;econd time, that the quantities employ'd in ver&s;e are but two, the one double of the other; that every &s;yl|lable is reducible to one or other of the&s;e &s;tandards; and that a &s;yllable of the larger quantity is termed <HI>long,</HI> and of the le&s;&s;er quantity <HI>&s;hort.</HI> It belongs more to the pre&s;ent article, to examine what pecu|liarities there may be in the Engli&s;h lan|guage as to long and &s;hort &s;yllables. In every language, there are &s;yllables that may be pronounced long or &s;hort at plea&s;ure; but the Engli&s;h above all abounds in &s;yllables of that kind. In words of three or more &s;yllables, the quantity for the mo&s;t part is invariable. The exceptions are more fre|quent in di&s;&s;yllables; but as to mono&s;ylla|bles, they may without many exceptions be pronounced either long or &s;hort. Nor is the ear hurt by this liberty; being accu&s;tomed to the variation of quantity in the &s;ame word. This &s;hows that the melody of Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="384" REF="385">
ver&s;e mu&s;t depend le&s;s upon quantity, than upon other circum&s;tances. In that par|ticular it differs widely from Latin ver&s;e. There, every &s;yllable having but one &s;ound, &s;trikes the ear con&s;tantly with its accu&s;tom|ed impre&s;&s;ion; and a reader mu&s;t be de|lighted to find a number of &s;uch &s;yllables, di&s;po&s;ed &s;o artfully as to rai&s;e a lively &s;en&s;e of melody. Syllables variable in quantity can|not po&s;&s;e&s;s this power. Cu&s;tom may ren|der familiar, both a long and &s;hort pronun|ciation of the &s;ame word; but the mind con&s;tantly wavering betwixt the two &s;ounds, cannot be &s;o much affected with a &s;yllable of this kind as with one which bears always the &s;ame &s;ound. What I have further to &s;ay upon quantity, will come in more pro|perly under the following head, of arrange|ment.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to arrangement, which may be brought within a narrow compa&s;s, the Engli&s;h heroic line is commonly Iam|bic, the fir&s;t &s;yllable &s;hort, the &s;econd long, and &s;o on alternately through the whole line. One exception there is, pretty fre|quent. Many lines commence with a
<PB N="385" REF="386">
Trochaeus, <HI>viz.</HI> a long and a &s;hort &s;yllable. But this affects not the order of the follow|ing &s;yllables. The&s;e go on alternately as u&s;ual, one &s;hort and one long. The fol|lowing couplet affords an example of each kind:
<Q><L>S&omacr;me &ibreve;n th&ebreve; f&imacr;elds &obreve;f p&umacr;r&ebreve;&s;t &aelig;&cmbmacr;th&ebreve;r pl&amacr;y,</L>
<L>&Abreve;nd b&amacr;&s;k &abreve;nd wh&imacr;t&ebreve;n &imacr;n th&ebreve; bl&amacr;ze &obreve;f d&amacr;y.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is unhappy in the con&s;truction of Engli&s;h ver&s;e, that it excludes the bulk of poly&s;yllables, though the mo&s;t &s;ounding words in our language; for upon examina|tion it will be found, that very few of them are compo&s;ed of &s;uch alternation of long and &s;hort &s;yllables as to corre&s;pond to either of the arrangements mentioned. Engli&s;h ver&s;e accordingly is almo&s;t totally reduced to di&s;&s;yllables and mono&s;yllables. <HI>Magna|nimity</HI> is a &s;ounding word totally excluded. <HI>Impetuo&s;ity</HI> is &s;till a finer word by the re&s;em|blance of the &s;ound and &s;en&s;e; and yet a negative is put upon it, as well as upon numberle&s;s words of the &s;ame kind. Poly|&s;yllables compo&s;ed of &s;yllables long and &s;hort alternately, make a good figure in
<PB N="386" REF="387">
ver&s;e; for example, <HI>ob&s;ervance, opponent, o&s;ten&s;ive, pindaric, productive, prolific,</HI> and &s;uch others of three &s;yllables. <HI>Imitation, imperfection, mi&s;demeanour, mitigation, mo|deration, ob&s;ervator, ornamental, regulator,</HI> and others &s;imilar of four &s;yllables, begin|ning with two &s;hort &s;yllables, the third long, and the fourth &s;hort, may find a place in a line commencing with a Trochaeus. I know not if there be any of five &s;yllables. One I know of &s;ix, <HI>viz. mi&s;interpretation.</HI> But words &s;o compo&s;ed are not frequent in our language.</P>
<P>One would not imagine without trial, how uncouth fal&s;e quantity appears in ver&s;e; not le&s;s than a provincial tone or idiom. The article <HI>the</HI> is one of the few mono&s;yllables that is invariably &s;hort. See how har&s;h it makes a line where it mu&s;t be pronounced long:
<Q><L>Th&ibreve;s n&ymacr;mph, t&obreve; th&emacr; d&ebreve;&s;tr&umacr;cti&obreve;n &omacr;f m&abreve;nk&imacr;nd,</L></Q>
Again:
<Q><L>Th'&abreve;dv&emacr;nt'r&obreve;us b&amacr;r&obreve;n th&emacr; br&ibreve;ght l&omacr;cks &abreve;dm&imacr;r'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="387" REF="388">
Let the article be pronounced &s;hort, and it reduces the melody almo&s;t to nothing. Better &s;o however than a fal&s;e quantity. In the following examples we perceive the &s;ame defect.<Q><L>And old impertinence &Verbar; expel by new.</L>
<L>With varying vanities &Verbar; from ev'ry part.</L>
<L>Love in the&s;e labyrinths &Verbar; his &s;laves detains.</L>

<L>Roar'd for the handkerchief &Verbar; that caus'd his pain.</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ions like elements &Verbar; though born to fight.</L></Q></P>
<P>The great variety of modulation con&s;pi|cuous in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, will be found upon trial to ari&s;e chiefly from the pau&s;es and ac|cents; and therefore the&s;e circum&s;tances are of greater importance than is commonly thought. There is a degree of intricacy in this branch of our &s;ubject, and it will re|quire &s;ome pains to give a di&s;tinct view of it. But we mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged by dif|ficulties. The pau&s;e, which paves the way to the accent, offers it&s;elf fir&s;t to our exami|nation. From a very &s;hort trial, the fol|lowing
<PB N="388" REF="389">
facts will be verified. 1&s;t, A line admits but one capital pau&s;e, 2d, In different lines, we find this pau&s;e after the fourth &s;yllable, after the fifth, after the &s;ixth, and after the &s;eventh. The&s;e parti|culars lay a &s;olid foundation for dividing Engli&s;h heroic lines into four &s;orts, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the different places of the pau&s;e. Nor is this an idle di&s;tinction. On the contrary, unle&s;s it be kept in view, we can|not have any ju&s;t notion of the richne&s;s and variety of Engli&s;h ver&s;ification. Each &s;ort or order hath a melody peculiar to it&s;elf, readily di&s;tingui&s;hable by a good ear; and, in the &s;equel, I am not without hopes to make the cau&s;e of this peculiarity &s;ufficient|ly evident. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame time, that the pau&s;e cannot be made indifferently at any of the places mentioned. It is the &s;en&s;e that regulates the pau&s;e, as will be &s;een more fully afterward; and con|&s;equently, it is the &s;en&s;e that determines of what order every line mu&s;t be. There can be but one capital mu&s;ical pau&s;e in a line; and this pau&s;e ought to coincide, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="389" REF="390">
with a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e; in order that the &s;ound may accord with the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid mu&s;t be illu&s;trated by ex|amples of each &s;ort or order. And fir&s;t of the pau&s;e after the fourth &s;yllable:
<Q><L>Back through the paths &Verbar; of plea&s;ing &s;en&s;e I ran</L></Q>
Again,
<Q><L>Profu&s;e of bli&s;s &Verbar; and pregnant with delight</L></Q>

<Q><L>So when an angel &Verbar; by divine command,</L>
<L>With ri&s;ing tempe&s;ts &Verbar; &s;hakes a guilty land,</L></Q>

Again,
<Q><L>And in the &s;mooth de&s;cription &Verbar; murmur &s;till</L></Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ide the capital pau&s;e now mentioned, other inferior or &s;emipau&s;es will be di&s;co|vered by a nice ear. Of the&s;e there are commonly two in each line; one before the capital pau&s;e, and one after it. The former is invariably placed after the fir&s;t long &s;yl|lable, whether the line begin with a long &s;yllable or a &s;hort. The other in its variety imitates the capital pau&s;e. In &s;ome lines it follows the 6th &s;yllable, in &s;ome the 7th, and in &s;ome the 8th. Of the&s;e &s;emipau&s;es take the following examples.</P>
<P>1&s;t and 8th:
<Q><L>Led &verbar; through a &s;ad &Verbar; variety &verbar; of wo.</L></Q>
1&s;t and 7th:
<Q><L>Still &verbar; on that brea&s;t &Verbar; enamour'd &verbar; let me lie</L></Q>
2d and 8th:
<Q><L>From &s;torms &verbar; a &s;helter &Verbar; and from heat &verbar; a &s;hade</L></Q>
<PB N="391" REF="392">
2d and 6th:
<Q><L>Let wealth &verbar; let honour &Verbar; wait &verbar; the wedded dame</L></Q>
2d and 7th:
<Q><L>Above &verbar; all pain &Verbar; all pa&s;&s;ion &verbar; and all pride</L></Q></P>
<P>Even from the&s;e few examples, it ap|pears, that the place of the la&s;t &s;emipau&s;e, like that of the full pau&s;e, is directed in a good mea&s;ure by the &s;en&s;e. Its proper place with re&s;pect to the melody is after the eighth &s;yllable, &s;o as to fini&s;h the line with an Iambus di&s;tinctly pronounced, which, by a long &s;yllable after a &s;hort, is a preparation for re&s;t. If this hold, the pla|cing this &s;emipau&s;e after the 6th or after the 7th &s;yllable, mu&s;t be directed by the &s;en&s;e, in order to avoid a pau&s;e in the middle of a word, or betwixt two words intimately connected; and &s;o far melody is ju&s;tly &s;a|crificed to &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing of the full pau&s;e in a Hex|ameter line, it is laid down as a rule, That it ought never to divide a word. Such licence deviates too far from the connection
<PB N="392" REF="393">
that ought to be betwixt the pau&s;es of &s;en&s;e and of melody. And in an Engli&s;h line, it is for the &s;ame rea&s;on equally wrong to divide a word by a full pau&s;e. Let us ju&s;tify this rea&s;on by experiments.
<Q><L>A noble &s;uper&Verbar;fluity it craves</L></Q><Q><L>Abhor, a perpe&Verbar;tuity &s;hould &s;tand</L></Q>
Are the&s;e lines di&s;tingui&s;hable from pro&s;e? Scarcely, I think.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule is not applicable to a &s;e|mipau&s;e, which being &s;hort and faint, is not &s;en&s;ibly di&s;agreeable when it divides a word.</P>
<Q><L>Relent&verbar;le&s;s walls &Verbar; who&s;e dark&s;ome round &verbar; contains</L></Q>
<Q><L>For her &verbar; white virgins &Verbar; hyme&verbar;neals &s;ing</L></Q>
<Q><L>In the&s;e &verbar; deep &s;olitudes &Verbar; and aw&verbar;ful cells</L></Q>
<P>It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that the melody here &s;uffers in &s;ome degree. A word ought to be pronounced without any re&s;t betwixt its component &s;yllables. The
<PB N="393" REF="394">
&s;emipau&s;e mu&s;t bend to this rule, and thereby vani&s;heth almo&s;t altogether.</P>
<P>With regard to the capital pau&s;e, it is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the melody, that a poet cannot be too nice in the choice of its place, in or|der to have it full, clear, and di&s;tinct. It cannot be placed more happily than with a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e; and if the &s;en&s;e require but a comma after the fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, or &s;eventh &s;yllable, there can be no diffi|culty about this mu&s;ical pau&s;e. But to make &s;uch coincidence e&s;&s;ential, would cramp ver&s;ification too much; and we have experience for our authority, that there may be a pau&s;e in the melody where the &s;en&s;e requires none. We mu&s;t not how|ever imagine, that a mu&s;ical pau&s;e may be placed at the end of any word indifferently. Some words, like &s;yllables of the &s;ame word, are &s;o intimately connected as not to bear a &s;eparation even by a pau&s;e. No good poet ever attempted to &s;eparate a &s;ub&s;tantive from its article: the dividing &s;uch intimate companions, would be har&s;h and unplea|&s;ant. The following line, for example,
<PB N="394" REF="395">
cannot be pronounced with a pau&s;e as marked.
<Q><L>If Delia &s;mile, the &Verbar; flow'rs begin to &s;pring</L></Q>
But ought to be pronounced in the follow|ing manner.
<Q><L>If Delia &s;mile, &Verbar; the flow'rs begin to &s;pring.</L></Q>
If then it be not a matter of indifferency where to make the pau&s;e, there ought to be rules for determining what words may be &s;eparated by a pau&s;e and what are in|capable of &s;uch &s;eparation. I &s;hall endea|vour to unfold the&s;e rules; not chiefly for their utility, but in order to exemplify &s;ome latent principles that tend to regulate our ta&s;te even where we are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of them. And to that end, it &s;eems the eli|gible method to run over the verbal rela|tions, beginning with the mo&s;t intimate. The fir&s;t that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is that of ad|jective and &s;ub&s;tantive, being the relation of &s;ub&s;tance and quality, the mo&s;t in|timate of all. A quality cannot exi&s;t inde|pendent of a &s;ub&s;tance, nor is it &s;eparable from it even in imagination, becau&s;e they
<PB N="395" REF="396">
make parts of the &s;ame idea; and for that rea&s;on, it mu&s;t, with regard to melody, be di&s;agreeable, to be&s;tow upon the adjective a &s;ort of independent exi&s;tence, by inter|jecting a pau&s;e betwixt it and its &s;ub&s;tan|tive. I cannot therefore approve the fol|lowing lines, nor any of the &s;ort; for to my ta&s;te they are har&s;h and unplea&s;ant.

I have upon this article multiplied exam|ples, that in a ca&s;e where I have the mi&s;|fortune to di&s;like what pa&s;&s;es current in practice, every man upon the &s;pot may judge by his own ta&s;te.

<P>Con&s;idering this matter in a &s;uperficial view, one might be apt to imagine, that it mu&s;t be the &s;ame, whether the adjective go fir&s;t, which is the natural order, or the &s;ub&s;tantive, which is indulged by the laws of inver&s;ion.

In a word, qualities, though related all to one &s;ubject, may be con&s;idered &s;eparately, and the &s;ubject may be con&s;ider|ed with &s;ome of its qualities independent of others; though we cannot form an image of any &s;ingle quality independent of the &s;ubject. Thus then, though an adjective named fir&s;t be in&s;eparable from the &s;ub|&s;tantive, the propo&s;ition does not recipro|cate. An image can be formed of the &s;ub|&s;tantive independent of the adjective; and for this rea&s;on, they may be &s;eparated by a pau&s;e, when the former is introduced be|fore the latter:
<Q><L>For thee, the fates &Verbar; &s;everely kind ordain</L></Q><Q><L>And curs'd with hearts &Verbar; unknowing how to yield.</L></Q></P>
<P>The verb and adverb are preci&s;ely in the &s;ame condition with the &s;ub&s;tantive and ad|jective. An adverb, which expre&s;&s;es a cer|tain modification of the action expre&s;&s;ed by the verb, is not &s;eparable from it even in i|magination. And therefore I mu&s;t al&s;o give up the following lines.
<Q><PB N="398" REF="399">
<L>And which it much &Verbar; becomes you to forget</L></Q><Q><L>'Tis one thing madly &Verbar; to di&s;per&s;e my &s;tore</L></Q>
But an action may be conceived leaving out a particular modification, preci&s;ely as a &s;ub|ject may be conceived leaving out a particu|lar quality; and therefore when by inver|&s;ion the verb is fir&s;t introduced, it has no bad effect to interject a pau&s;e betwixt it and the adverb which follows. This may be done at the clo&s;e of a line, where the pau&s;e is at lea&s;t as full as that is which divides the line:
<Q><L>While yet he &s;poke, the Prince advancing drew</L>
<L>Nigh to the lodge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The agent and its action come next, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in grammar by the active &s;ub&s;tan|tive and its verb. Betwixt the&s;e, placed in their natural order, there is no difficulty of interjecting a pau&s;e. An active being is not always in motion, and therefore it is ea&s;ily &s;eparable in idea from its action. When in a &s;entence the &s;ub&s;tantive takes the lead, we know not that action is to follow; and
<PB N="399" REF="400">
as re&s;t mu&s;t precede the commencement of motion, this interval is a proper opportu|nity for a pau&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when by inver&s;ion the verb is placed fir&s;t, is it lawful to &s;epa|rate it by a pau&s;e from the active &s;ub&s;tan|tive? I an&s;wer not, becau&s;e an action is not in idea &s;eparable from the agent, more than a quality from the &s;ub&s;tance to which it belongs. Two lines of the fir&s;t rate for beauty have always appeared to me excep|tionable, upon account of the pau&s;e thus interjected betwixt the verb and the con&s;e|quent &s;ub&s;tantive; and I have now di&s;co|vered a rea&s;on to &s;upport my ta&s;te:
<Q><L>In the&s;e deep &s;olitudes and awful cells,</L>
<L>Where heav'nly-pen&s;ive &Verbar; Contemplation dwells,</L>
<L>And ever-mu&s;ing &Verbar; Melancholy reigns.</L></Q></P>
<P>The point of the greate&s;t delicacy regards the active verb and the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ub&s;tantive placed in their natural order. On the one &s;ide it will be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e words &s;ignify things which are not &s;eparable in idea. Killing cannot be conceived with|out
<PB N="400" REF="401">
&s;ome being that is put to death, nor painting without a &s;urface upon which the colours are &s;pread. On the other &s;ide, an action and the thing on which it is exerted, are not, like &s;ub&s;tance and quality, united in one individual &s;ubject. The active &s;ubject is perfectly di&s;tinct from that which is pa&s;|&s;ive; and they are connected by one cir|cum&s;tance only, that the action exerted by the former, is exerted upon the latter. This makes it po&s;&s;ible to take the action to pieces, and to con&s;ider it fir&s;t with relation to the a|gent, and next with relation to the patient. But after all, &s;o intimately connected are the parts of the thought, that it requires an effort to make a &s;eparation even for a mo|ment. The &s;ubtili&s;ing to &s;uch a degree is not agreeable, e&s;pecially in works of imagi|nation. The be&s;t poets however, taking advantage of this &s;ubtilty, &s;cruple not to &s;eparate by a pau&s;e an active verb from its pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject. Such pau&s;es in a long work may be indulged; but taken &s;ingly, they certainly are not agreeable. I appeal to the following examples.
<Q><PB N="401" REF="402">
<L>The peer now &s;preads &Verbar; the glitt'ring forfex wide</L></Q><Q><L>As ever &s;ully'd &Verbar; the fair face of light</L></Q><Q><L>Repair'd to &s;earch &Verbar; the gloomy cave of Spleen</L></Q><Q><L>Nothing, to make &Verbar; philo&s;ophy thy friend</L></Q><Q><L>Shou'd chance to make &Verbar; the well-dre&s;s'd rabble &s;tare</L></Q><Q><L>Or cro&s;s, to plunder &Verbar; provinces, the main</L></Q><Q><L>The&s;e madmen never hurt &Verbar; the church or &s;tate</L></Q><Q><L>How &s;hall we fill &Verbar; a library with wit</L></Q><Q><L>What better teach &Verbar; a foreigner the tongue?</L></Q><Q><L>Sure, if I &s;pare &Verbar; the mini&s;ter, no rules</L> <L>Of honour bind me, not to maul his tools.</L></Q>
On the other hand, when the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ub|ject by inver&s;ion is fir&s;t named, there is no difficulty of interjecting a pau&s;e betwixt it and the verb, more than when the active &s;ubject is fir&s;t named. The &s;ame rea&s;on holds in both, that though a verb cannot be &s;eparated in idea from the &s;ub&s;tantive which governs it, and &s;carcely from the &s;ub&s;tantive it governs; yet a &s;ub&s;tantive
<PB N="402" REF="403">
may always be conceived independent of the verb. When the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject is in|troduced before the verb, we know not that an action is to be exerted upon it; therefore we may re&s;t till the action com|mences. For the &s;ake of illu&s;tration take the following examples.<Q><L>Shrines! where their vigils &Verbar; pale-ey'd virgins keep</L></Q><Q><L>Soon as thy letters &Verbar; trembling I unclo&s;e</L></Q><Q><L>No happier ta&s;k &Verbar; the&s;e faded eyes pur&s;ue</L></Q></P>
<P>What is &s;aid about placing the pau&s;e, leads to a general ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for afterwards. The natural order of placing the active &s;ub&s;tantive and its verb, is more friendly to a pau&s;e than the inverted order. But in all the other connections, inver&s;ion affords by far a bet|ter opportunity for a pau&s;e. Upon this de|pends one of the great advantages that blank ver&s;e hath over rhyme. The privi|lege of inver&s;ion, in which it far excels rhyme, gives it a much greater choice of pau&s;es, than can be had in the natural order of arrangement.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="404">
We now proceed to the &s;lighter connec|tions, which &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in one gene|ral article. Words connected by conjunc|tions and prepo&s;itions freely admit a pau&s;e betwixt them, which will be clear from the following in&s;tances.

Connecting particles were invented to unite in a period two &s;ub&s;tantives &s;ignifying things occa&s;ionally united in the thought, but which have no natural union. And be|twixt two things not only &s;eparable in idea, but really di&s;tinct, the mind, for the &s;ake of melody, chearfully admits by a pau&s;e a momentary disjunction of their occa&s;ional union.</P>
<P>One capital branch of the &s;ubject is &s;till upon hand, to which I am directed by what is ju&s;t now &s;aid. It concerns tho&s;e parts of &s;peech which &s;ingly repre&s;ent no idea, and which become not &s;ignificant till they be joined to other words. I mean conjunctions,

Whe|ther, for example, in the following lines, the &s;eparation of the acce&s;&s;ory prepo&s;ition from the principal &s;ub&s;tantive, be according to rule?
<Q><L>The godde&s;s with &Verbar; a di&s;contented air</L></Q><Q><L>And heighten'd by &Verbar; the diamond's circling rays</L></Q><Q><L>When victims at &Verbar; you altar's foot we lay</L></Q><Q><L>So take it in &Verbar; the very words of Creech</L></Q><Q><L>An en&s;ign of &Verbar; the delegates of Jove</L></Q><Q><L>Two ages o'er &Verbar; his native realm he reign'd</L></Q><Q><L>While angels, with &Verbar; their &s;ilver wings o'er&s;hade</L></Q>
Or &s;eparating the conjunction from the word it connects with what goes before:
<Q><L>Talthybius and &Verbar; Eurybates the good</L></Q>
It will be obvious at the fir&s;t glance, that the foregoing rea&s;oning upon objects natu|rally
<PB N="405" REF="406">
connected, are not applicable to words which of them&s;elves are mere ciphers. We mu&s;t therefore have recour&s;e to &s;ome other principle for &s;olving the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. The&s;e particles out of their place are total|ly in&s;ignificant. To give them a meaning, they mu&s;t be joined to certain words. The nece&s;&s;ity of this junction, together with cu&s;tom, forms an artificial connection, which has a &s;trong influence upon the mind. It cannot bear even a momentary &s;eparation, which de&s;troys the &s;en&s;e, and is at the &s;ame time contradictory to practice. Another circum&s;tance tends &s;till more to make this &s;eparation di&s;agreeable. The long &s;yllable immediately preceding the full pau&s;e, mu&s;t be accented; for this is requi|red by the melody, as will afterward ap|pear. But it is ridiculous to accent or put an empha&s;is upon a low word that rai&s;es no idea, and is confined to the humble pro|vince of connecting words that rai&s;e ideas. And for that rea&s;on, a line mu&s;t be di&s;a|greeable where a particle immediately pre|cedes the full pau&s;e; for &s;uch con&s;truction
<PB N="406" REF="407">
of a line makes the melody di&s;cord with the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have di&s;cour&s;ed upon that pau&s;e only which divides the line. Are the &s;ame rules applicable to the concluding pau&s;e? This mu&s;t be an&s;wered by making a di&s;tinction. In the fir&s;t line of a couplet, the concluding pau&s;e differs little, if at all, from the pau&s;e which divides the line; and for that rea&s;on, the rules are applicable to both equally. The concluding pau&s;e of the couplet, is in a different condition: it re|&s;embles greatly the concluding pau&s;e in a Hexameter line. Both of them indeed are &s;o remarkable, that they never can be grace|ful, unle&s;s when they accompany a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e. Hence it follows, that a couplet ought always to be fini&s;hed with &s;ome clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e; if not a point, at lea&s;t a comma. The truth is, that this rule is &s;eldom tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed. In Pope's works, upon a cur&s;ory &s;earch indeed, I found but the following deviations from the rule.
<Q><PB N="407" REF="408">
<L>Nothing is foreign: parts relate to whole;</L>
<L>One all-extending, all-pre&s;erving &s;oul</L>

<L>To &s;teal from rainbows ere they drop in &s;how'rs</L>
<L>A brighter wa&s;h&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But now, &s;uppo&s;ing the connection to be &s;o &s;lender as to admit a pau&s;e, it follows not that a pau&s;e may always be put. There is one rule to which every other ought to bend, That the &s;en&s;e mu&s;t never be wound|ed or ob&s;cured by the mu&s;ic; and upon that account, I condemn the following lines:
<Q><L>Uly&s;&s;es, fir&s;t &Verbar; in public cares, &s;he found.</L></Q>
And,
<Q><L>Who ri&s;ing, high &Verbar; th'imperial &s;ceptre rais'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to inver&s;ion, it appears both from rea&s;on and experiments, that many words which cannot bear a &s;eparation in their natural order, admit a pau&s;e when in|verted. And it may be added, that when
<PB N="408" REF="409">
two words, or two members of a &s;entence, in their natural order, can be &s;eparated by a pau&s;e, &s;uch &s;eparation can never be ami&s;s in an inverted order. An inverted period, which runs cro&s;s to the natural train of ideas, requires to be marked in &s;ome mea|&s;ure even by pau&s;es in the &s;en&s;e, that the parts may be di&s;tinctly known. Take the following examples.
<Q><L>As with cold lips &Verbar; I ki&s;s'd the &s;acred veil.</L></Q><Q><L>With other beauties &Verbar; charm my partial eyes.</L></Q><Q><L>Full in my view &Verbar; &s;et all the bright abode.</L></Q><Q><L>With words like the&s;e &Verbar; the troops Uly&s;&s;es rul'd.</L></Q><Q><L>Back to th' a&s;&s;embly roll &Verbar; the thronging train.</L></Q><Q><L>Not for their grief &Verbar; the Grecian ho&s;t I blame.</L></Q>
The &s;ame where the &s;eparation is made at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t line of the couplet:
<Q><L>For &s;pirits, freed from mortal laws, with ea&s;e</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ume what &s;exes and what &s;hapes they plea&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>The pau&s;e is tolerable even at the clo&s;e of the couplet, for the rea&s;on ju&s;t now &s;ugge&s;t|ed,
<PB N="409" REF="410">
that inverted members require &s;ome &s;light pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e:
<Q><L>'Twas where the plane-tree &s;pread its &s;hades a|round:</L>
<L>The altars heav'd; and from the crumbling ground</L>
<L>A mighty dragon &s;hot.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus a train of rea&s;oning hath in&s;en&s;ibly led us to conclu&s;ions with regard to the mu&s;ical pau&s;e, very different from tho&s;e in the fir&s;t &s;ection, concerning the &s;eparating by an interjected circum&s;tance words inti|mately connected. One would conjecture, that where-ever words are &s;eparable by in|terjecting a circum&s;tance, they &s;hould be e|qually &s;eparable by interjecting a pau&s;e. But, upon a more narrow in&s;pection, the appearance of analogy vani&s;heth. To make this evident, I need only premi&s;e, that a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hes the different members of a period from each other; that two words of the &s;ame member may be &s;e|parated by a circum&s;tance, all the three making &s;till but one member; and therefore that a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e has no connection with the &s;eparation of words by interjected
<PB N="410" REF="411">
circum&s;tances. This &s;ets the matter in a clear light. It is ob&s;erved above, that the mu&s;ical pau&s;e is intimately connected with the pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e; &s;o intimately indeed, that regularly they ought to coincide. As this would be too great a re&s;traint, a licence is indulged, to place pau&s;es for the &s;ake of the mu&s;ic where they are not nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;en&s;e. But this licence mu&s;t be kept within bounds. And a mu&s;ical pau&s;e ought never to be placed where a pau&s;e is excluded by the &s;en&s;e; as, for example, be|twixt the adjective and following &s;ub&s;tantive which make parts of the &s;ame idea, and &s;till le&s;s betwixt a particle and the word which makes it &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tracting at pre&s;ent from the peculia|rity of modulation ari&s;ing from the different pau&s;es, it cannot fail to be ob&s;erved in general, that they introduce into our ver&s;e no &s;light degree of variety. Nothing more fatigues the ear, than a number of uniform lines having all the &s;ame pau&s;e, which is extremely remarkable in the French ver&s;ifi|cation. This imperfection will be di&s;cern|ed by a fine ear even in the &s;horte&s;t &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="411" REF="412">
and becomes intolerable in a long poem. Pope excels all the world in the variety of his modulation, which indeed is not le&s;s perfect of its kind than that of Virgil.</P>
<P>From what is now &s;aid, there ought to be one exception. Uniformity in the members of a thought, demands equal uni|formity in the members of the period which expre&s;&s;es that thought. When therefore re&s;embling objects or things are expre&s;&s;ed in a plurality of ver&s;e-lines, the&s;e lines in their &s;tructure ought to be as uniform as po&s;&s;ible, and the pau&s;es in particular ought all of them to have the &s;ame place. Take the following examples.
<Q><L>By foreign hands &Verbar; thy dying eyes were clos'd,</L>
<L>By foreign hands &Verbar; thy decent limbs compos'd,</L>
<L>By foreign hands &Verbar; thy humble grave adorn'd.</L></Q>
Again,
<Q><L>Bright as the &s;un, &Verbar; her eyes the gazers &s;trike,</L>
<L>And, like the &s;un, &Verbar; they &s;hine on all alike.</L></Q>

<L>Lives through all life &Verbar; extends through all extent,</L>
<L>Spreads undivided &Verbar; operates un&s;pent.</L></Q></P>
<P>Pau&s;es are like to dwell longer upon hand than I imagined; for the &s;ubject is not yet exhau&s;ted. It is laid down above, that Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e, con&s;idering melo|dy only, admits no more than four capital pau&s;es; and that the capital pau&s;e of every line is determined by the &s;en&s;e to be after the fourth, the fifth, the &s;ixth, or &s;eventh &s;yllable. And that this doc|trine holds true &s;o far as melody alone is concerned, every good ear will bear te&s;ti|mony. At the &s;ame time, examples are not unfrequent, in Milton e&s;pecially, of the capital pau&s;e being after the fir&s;t, the &s;e|cond, or the third &s;yllable And that this licence may be taken, even gracefully, when it adds vigour to the expre&s;&s;ion, I readily admit. So far the &s;ound may be ju&s;tly &s;acrificed to the &s;en&s;e or expre&s;&s;ion. That this licence may be &s;ucce&s;sfully taken,
<PB N="413" REF="414">
will be clear from the following example. Pope, in his tran&s;lation of Homer, de|&s;cribes a rock broke off from a mountain, and hurling to the plain, in the following words.
<Q><L>From &s;teep to &s;teep the rolling ruin bounds;</L>
<L>At every &s;hock the crackling wood re&s;ounds;</L>
<L>Still gath'ring force, it &s;mocks; and urg'd amain,</L>
<L>Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:</L>
<L>There &s;tops &Verbar; So Hector. Their whole force he prov'd,</L>
<L>Re&s;i&s;tle&s;s when he rag'd; and when he &s;topt, un|mov'd.</L></Q>
In the penult line the proper place of the mu&s;ical pau&s;e is at the end of the fifth &s;yl|lable; but it enlivens the expre&s;&s;ion by its coincidence with that of the &s;en&s;e at the end of the &s;econd &s;yllable. The &s;top|ping &s;hort before the u&s;ual pau&s;e in the melody, aids the impre&s;&s;ion that is made by the de&s;cription of the &s;tone's &s;topping &s;hort. And what is lo&s;t to the melody by this artifice, is more than compen&s;ated by the force that is added to the de&s;cription.
<PB N="414" REF="415">

<P>If we con&s;ider the foregoing pa&s;&s;ages with re&s;pect to melody &s;ingly, the pau&s;es are undoubtedly out of their proper place. But being united with tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;e, they inforce the expre&s;&s;ion and enliven it greatly. And the beauty of expre&s;&s;ion is communicated to the &s;ound, which, by a natural deception, makes even the melody appear more perfect than if the mu&s;ical pau&s;es were regular.</P>
<P>To explain the rules of accenting, two general ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be premi&s;ed. The fir&s;t is, That accents have a double effect. They contribute to the melody, by giving it air and &s;pirit: they contribute not le&s;s to the &s;en&s;e, by di&s;tingui&s;hing important words from others. The&s;e two effects ought never to be &s;eparated. If a mu&s;ical accent be put where the &s;en&s;e rejects it, we feel a di&s;cordance betwixt the thought and
<PB N="416" REF="417">
the melody. An accent, for example, placed on a word that makes no figure, has the effect to burle&s;k it, by giving it an unnatural elevation. The injury thus done to the &s;en&s;e, is communicated to the melo|dy by the intimacy of connection, and both &s;eem to be wounded. This rule is applicable in a peculiar manner to particles. It is indeed ridiculous to put an empha&s;is on a word which of it&s;elf has no meaning, and like cement &s;erves only to unite words &s;ignificant. The other general ob&s;ervation is, That a word of whatever number of &s;yllables, is not accented upon more than one of them. Nor is this an arbitrary prac|tice. The object repre&s;ented by the word, is &s;et in its be&s;t light by a &s;ingle accent: reiterated accents on different &s;yllables in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, make not the empha&s;is &s;tronger; but have an air, as if the &s;ound only of the accented &s;yllables were regarded, and not the &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>Keeping in view the foregoing ob&s;erva|tions, the doctrine of accenting Engli&s;h he|roic ver&s;e, is extremely &s;imple. In the fir&s;t place, accenting is confined to the long
<PB N="417" REF="418">
&s;yllables; for the melody admits not an accent upon any &s;hort &s;yllable. In the next place, as the melody is inriched in propor|tion to the number of accents, every word that has a long &s;yllable ought to be accent|ed, unle&s;s where the accent is rejected by the &s;en&s;e: a word, as ob&s;erved, that makes no figure by its &s;ignification, cannot bear an accent. According to this rule, a line may admit five accents; a ca&s;e by no means rare.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing every long &s;yllable to be accented, there is con&s;tantly, in every line, one accent which makes a greater figure than the re&s;t. This capital accent is that which precedes the capital pau&s;e. Hence it is di&s;tingui&s;hable into two kinds; one that is immediately &s;ucceeded by the pau&s;e, and one that is divided from the pau&s;e by a &s;hort &s;yllable. The former be|longs to lines of the fir&s;t and third order: the latter to tho&s;e of the &s;econd and fourth. Examples of the fir&s;t kind.

The&s;e accents make different impre&s;&s;ions on the mind, which will be the &s;ubject of a following &s;peculation. In the mean time, it may be &s;afely pronounced a capi|tal defect in the compo&s;ition of ver&s;e, to put a low word, incapable of an accent, in the place where this accent &s;hould be. This bars the accent altogether; and I know no other fault more &s;ubver&s;ive of the melody, if it be not that of barring a pau&s;e altogether. I may add affirmatively, that it is a capital beauty in the compo&s;ition of ver&s;e, to have the mo&s;t important word of the &s;entence, &s;o placed as that this capital accent may be laid upon it. No &s;ingle circum&s;tance contri|butes more to the energy of ver&s;e, than to

have this accent on a word, that, by the importance of its meaning, is intitled to a peculiar empha&s;is. To &s;how the bad effect of excluding the capital accent, I refer the reader to &s;ome in&s;tances given above, p. 000, where particles are &s;eparated by a pau&s;e from the capital words that make them &s;ignificant, and which particles ought, for the &s;ake of the melody, to be accented, were they capable of an accent. Add to the&s;e the following in&s;tances from the E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.<Q><L>Oft, leaving what &Verbar; is natural and fit,</L>

<P>In a line expre&s;&s;ive of what is humble or dejected, it improves the re&s;emblance be|twixt the &s;ound and &s;en&s;e, to exclude the capital accent. This, to my ta&s;te, is a beauty in the following lines.<Q><L>In th&ecirc;&s;e deep s&ocirc;litudes &Verbar; and a&wcirc;ful cells</L></Q><Q><L>The p&ocirc;or inh&acirc;bitant &Verbar; beh&ocirc;lds in vain</L></Q></P>
<P>To conclude this article, the accents are not, like the &s;yllables, confined to a certain number Some lines have no fewer than
<PB N="421" REF="422">
five, and there are lines that admit not a|bove one. This variety, as we have &s;een, depends entirely on the different powers of the component words. Particles, even where they are long by po&s;ition, cannot be accented; and poly&s;yllables, whatever &s;pace they occupy, admit but one accent. Poly|&s;yllables have another defect, that they generally exclude the full pau&s;e. I have &s;hown above, that few poly&s;yllables can find place in the con&s;truction of Engli&s;h ver&s;e. Here are rea&s;ons for excluding them, could they find place.</P>
<P>I am now prepared to fulfil a promi&s;e concerning the four &s;orts of lines that enter into Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e. That the&s;e have, each of them, a peculiar melody di&s;tingui&s;h|able by a good ear, I ventured to &s;ugge&s;t, and promi&s;ed to account for: and though this &s;ubject is extremely delicate, I am not without hopes of making good my engage|ment. Fir&s;t, however, like a wary gene|ral, I take all advantages the ground will permit. I do not aver, that this peculiarity of modulation is in every in&s;tance per|ceptible.
<PB N="422" REF="423">
Far from it. The impre&s;&s;ion made by a period, whether it be ver&s;e or pro&s;e, is occa&s;ioned chiefly by the thought, and in an inferior degree by the words; and the&s;e articles are &s;o intimately uni|ted with the melody, that they have each of them a &s;trong influence upon the others. With re&s;pect to the melody in particular, in&s;tances are without number, of melody, in it&s;elf poor and weak, pa&s;&s;ing for rich and &s;pirited where it is &s;upported by the thought and expre&s;&s;ion. I am therefore intitled to in&s;i&s;t, that this experiment be tried upon lines of equal rank. And to a|void the perplexity of various ca&s;es, I mu&s;t al&s;o in&s;i&s;t, that the lines cho&s;en for a trial be regularly accented before the pau&s;e: for upon a matter abundantly refined in it&s;elf, I would not willingly be imbarra&s;&s;ed with faulty and irregular lines. The&s;e prelimi|naries being adju&s;ted, I begin with &s;ome general ob&s;ervations, that will &s;ave repeating the &s;ame thing over and over upon each par|ticular ca&s;e. And, fir&s;t, an accent &s;ucceed|ed by a pau&s;e, makes &s;en&s;ibly a deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion than where the voice goes on with|out
<PB N="423" REF="424">
a &s;top: to make an impre&s;&s;ion re|quires time; and there is no time where there is no pau&s;e. The fact is &s;o certain, that in running over a few lines, there is &s;carce an ear &s;o dull as not readily to di&s;tingui&s;h from others, that particular accent which immediately precedes the full pau&s;e. In the next place, the elevation of an accenting tone, produceth in the mind a &s;imilar ele|vation, which is continued during the pau&s;e. Every circum&s;tance is different where the pau&s;e is &s;eparated from the accent by a &s;hort &s;yllable. The impre&s;&s;ion made by the ac|cent is more &s;light when there is no &s;top; and the elevation of the accent is gone in a moment by the falling of the voice in pro|nouncing the &s;hort &s;yllable that follows. The pau&s;e al&s;o is &s;en&s;ibly affected by the po&s;ition of the accent. In lines of the fir&s;t and third order, the clo&s;e conjunction of the accent and pau&s;e, occa&s;ions a &s;udden &s;top without preparation, which rou&s;es the mind, and be&s;tows on the melody a &s;pirit|ed air. When, on the other hand, the pau&s;e is &s;eparated from the accent by a &s;hort &s;yllable, which always happens in
<PB N="424" REF="425">
lines of the &s;econd and fourth order, the pau&s;e is &s;oft and gentle. This &s;hort unac|cented &s;yllable &s;ucceeding one that is ac|cented, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be pronounced with a falling voice, which naturally prepares for a pau&s;e. The mind falls gently from the accent|ed &s;yllable, and &s;lides into re&s;t as it were in&s;en&s;ibly. Further, the lines them&s;elves, derive different powers from the po&s;ition of the pau&s;e. A pau&s;e after the fourth &s;ylla|ble divides the line into two unequal por|tions, of which the large&s;t comes la&s;t. This circum&s;tance re&s;olving the line into an a&s;cending &s;eries, makes an impre&s;&s;ion in pronouncing like that of mounting upward. And to this impre&s;&s;ion contributes the re|doubled effort in pronouncing the large&s;t portion, which is la&s;t in order. The mind has a different feeling when the pau&s;e &s;ucceeds the fifth &s;yllable. The line being divided into two equal parts by this pau&s;e, the&s;e parts, pronounced with equal effort, are agreeable by their uniformity. A line divided by a pau&s;e after the &s;ixth &s;yllable, makes an impre&s;&s;ion oppo&s;ite to that fir&s;t mentioned. Being divided into two une|qual
<PB N="425" REF="426">
portions, of which the &s;horte&s;t is la&s;t in order, it appears like a &s;low de&s;cending &s;eries; and the &s;econd portion being pro|nounced with le&s;s effort than the fir&s;t, the dimini&s;hed effort prepares the mind for re&s;t. And this preparation for re&s;t is &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly felt where the pau&s;e is after the &s;eventh &s;yllable, as in lines of the fourth order.</P>
<P>No per&s;on can be at a lo&s;s in applying the&s;e ob&s;ervations. A line of the fir&s;t order is of all the mo&s;t &s;pirited and lively. To produce this effect, &s;everal of the circum|&s;tances above mentioned concur. The accent, being followed in&s;tantly by a pau&s;e, makes an illu&s;trious figure: the elevated tone of the accent elevates the mind: the mind is &s;up|ported in its elevation by the &s;udden un|prepared pau&s;e which rou&s;es and animates: and the line it&s;elf, repre&s;enting by its une|qual divi&s;ion an a&s;cending &s;eries, carries the mind &s;till higher, making an impre&s;&s;ion &s;i|milar to that of mounting upward. The &s;econd order has a modulation &s;en&s;ibly &s;weet, &s;oft, and flowing. The accent is not &s;o &s;prightly as in the former, becau&s;e a
<PB N="426" REF="427">
&s;hort &s;yllable intervenes betwixt it and the pau&s;e: its elevation, by the &s;ame means, vani&s;heth in&s;tantaneou&s;ly: the mind, by a falling voice, is gently prepared for a &s;top: and the plea&s;ure of uniformity from the di|vi&s;ion of the line into two equal parts, is calm and &s;weet. The third order has a modulation not &s;o ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed in words. It in part re&s;embles the fir&s;t order, by the liveline&s;s of an accent &s;ucceeded in&s;tantly by a full pau&s;e. But then the elevation oc|ca&s;ioned by this circum&s;tance, is balanced in &s;ome degree by the remitted effort in pronouncing the &s;econd portion, which re|mitted effort has a tendency to re&s;t. An|other circum&s;tance di&s;tingui&s;heth it remark|ably. Its capital accent comes late, being placed on the &s;ixth &s;yllable; and this cir|cum&s;tance be&s;tows on it an air of gravity and &s;olemnity. The la&s;t order re&s;embles the &s;econd in the mildne&s;s of its accent and &s;oftne&s;s of its pau&s;e. It is &s;till more &s;olemn than the third, by the latene&s;s of its capital accent. It al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a higher degree than the third, the tendency to re&s;t; and by that circum&s;tance is of all the be&s;t qua|lified
<PB N="427" REF="428">
for clo&s;ing a period in the complete&s;t manner.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not all the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of the different orders. Each order al&s;o, by means of its final accent and pau&s;e, makes a peculiar impre&s;&s;ion; &s;o pe|culiar as to produce a melody clearly di&s;|tingui&s;hable from that of the others. This peculiarity is occa&s;ioned by the divi&s;ion which the capital pau&s;e makes in a line. By an unequal divi&s;ion in the fir&s;t order, the mind has an impre&s;&s;ion of a&s;cending; and is left at the clo&s;e in the highe&s;t eleva|tion, which is di&s;play'd on the concluding &s;yllable. By this means, a &s;trong empha&s;is is naturally laid upon the concluding &s;ylla|ble, whether by rai&s;ing the voice to a &s;harper tone, or by expre&s;&s;ing the word in a fuller tone. This order accordingly is of all the lea&s;t proper for concluding a period, where a cadence is proper, and not an ac|cent. In the &s;econd order, the final ac|cent makes not &s;o capital a figure. There is nothing &s;ingular in its being marked by a pau&s;e, for this is common to all the orders; and this order, being de&s;titute of the im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="428" REF="429">
of a&s;cent, cannot rival the fir&s;t or|der in the elevation of its accent, nor con|&s;equently in the dignity of its pau&s;e; for the&s;e always have a mutual influence. This order, however, with re&s;pect to its clo&s;e, maintains a &s;uperiority over the third and fourth orders. In the&s;e the clo&s;e is more humble, being brought down by the impre&s;&s;ion of de&s;cent, and by the remitted effort in pronouncing; con&s;iderably in the third order, and &s;till more con&s;iderably in the la&s;t. According to this de&s;cription, the concluding accents and pau&s;es of the four orders being reduced to a &s;cale, will form a de&s;cending &s;eries probably in an arithmeti|cal progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After what is &s;aid, will it be thought re|fining too much to &s;ugge&s;t, that the different orders are qualified for different purpo&s;es, and that a poet of genius will be naturally led to make a choice accordingly? I cannot think this altogether chimerical. It appears to me, that the fir&s;t order is proper for a &s;en|timent that is bold, lively, or impetuous; that the third order is proper for &s;ubjects grave, &s;olemn, or lofty; the &s;econd for
<PB N="429" REF="430">
what is tender, delicate, or melancholy, and in general for all the &s;ympathetic emo|tions; and the la&s;t for &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kind, when tempered with any degree of &s;olemnity. I do not contend, that any one order is fitted for no other ta&s;k, than that a&s;&s;igned it. At that rate, no &s;ort of modu|lation would be left for accompanying ordi|nary thoughts, that have nothing peculiar in them. I only venture to &s;ugge&s;t, and I do it with diffidence, that one order is pe|culiarly adapted to certain &s;ubjects, and better qualified than the others for expre&s;&s;|ing &s;uch &s;ubjects. The be&s;t way to judge is by experiment; and to avoid the impu|tation of a partial &s;earch, I &s;hall confine my in&s;tances to a &s;ingle poem, beginning with the fir&s;t order.
<Q><L>On her white brea&s;t, a &s;parkling cro&s;s &s;he wore,</L>
<L>Which Jews might ki&s;s, and Infidels adore.</L>
<L>Her lively looks, a &s;prightly mind di&s;clo&s;e,</L>
<L>Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as tho&s;e:</L>
<L>Favours to none, to all &s;he &s;miles extends;</L>
<L>Oft &s;he rejects, but never once offends.</L>
<L>Bright as the &s;un, her eyes the gazers &s;trike,</L>
<L>And, like the &s;un, they &s;hine on all alike.</L>
<L><PB N="430" REF="431">
Yet graceful ea&s;e, and &s;weetne&s;s void of pride,</L>
<L>Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:</L>

<L>Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.</L>

In accounting for the remarkable liveline&s;s of this pa&s;&s;age, it will be acknowledged by every one who has an ear, that the modu|lation mu&s;t come in for a &s;hare. The lines, all of them, are of the fir&s;t order; a very unu&s;ual circum&s;tance in the author of this poem, &s;o eminent for variety in his ver&s;ifi|cation. Who can doubt, that, in this pa&s;|&s;age, he has been led by delicacy of ta&s;te to employ the fir&s;t order preferably to the o|thers?</P>

<P>Mu&s;ing on the foregoing &s;ubject, I begin to doubt whether I have not been all this while in a reverie. Here unexpectedly a &s;ort of fairy-&s;cene opens, where every ob|ject is new and &s;ingular. Is there any truth in the appearance, or is it merely a work of imagination? The &s;cene &s;eems to be a reality; and if it can bear ex|amination, it mu&s;t exalt greatly the me|lody of Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e. If uni|formity prevail, in the arrangement, in the equality of the lines, and in the re|&s;emblance of the final &s;ounds; variety is &s;till more con&s;picuous in the pau&s;es and accents,
<PB N="435" REF="436">
which are diver&s;ified in a &s;urpri&s;ing man|ner. The beauty that re&s;ults from com|bined objects, is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved to con&s;i&s;t in a due mixture of uniformity and varie|ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 9.</NOTE>. Of this beauty many in&s;tances have already occurred, but none more illu&s;trious than Engli&s;h ver&s;ification. However rude it may be by the &s;implicity of arrange|ment, it is highly melodious by its pau|&s;es and accents, &s;o as already to rival the mo&s;t perfect &s;pecies known in Greece or Rome. And it is no di&s;agreeable pro|&s;pect to find it &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;till greater re|finement.</P>
<P>We proceed to blank ver&s;e, which hath &s;o many circum&s;tances in common with rhyme, that what is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid upon it may be brought within a narrow compa&s;s. With re&s;pect to form, it differs not from rhyme farther than in rejecting the jingle of &s;imilar &s;ounds. But let us not think this difference a trifle, or that we gain nothing by it but the purifying our
<PB N="436" REF="437">
ver&s;e from a plea&s;ure &s;o childi&s;h. In truth, our ver&s;e is extremely cramped by rhyme; and the great advantage of blank ver&s;e is, that, being free from the fetters of rhyme, it is at liberty to attend the imagination in its bolde&s;t flights. Rhyme nece&s;&s;arily di|vides ver&s;e into couplets: each couplet makes a complete mu&s;ical period; the parts of which are divided by pau&s;es, and the whole &s;ummed up by a full clo&s;e at the end: the modulation begins anew with the next couplet: and in this manner a compo&s;ition in rhyme proceeds couplet after couplet. I have more than once had occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve the influence that &s;ound and &s;en&s;e have upon each other by their intimate union. If a couplet be a com|plete period with regard to the melody, it ought regularly to be &s;o al&s;o with re|gard to the &s;en&s;e. This, it is true, proves too great a cramp upon compo&s;ition; and licences are indulged, as explained a|bove. The&s;e however mu&s;t be u&s;ed with di&s;cretion, &s;o as to pre&s;erve &s;ome degree of uniformity betwixt the &s;en&s;e and the mu&s;ic.
<PB N="437" REF="438">
There ought never to be a full clo&s;e in the &s;en&s;e but at the end of a couplet; and there ought always to be &s;ome pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e at the end of every couplet. The &s;ame period as to &s;en&s;e may be extended through &s;everal couplets; but in this ca&s;e each couplet ought to contain a di&s;tinct member, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e as well as in the &s;ound; and the whole ought to be clo&s;ed with a com|plete cadence. Rules &s;uch as the&s;e, mu&s;t confine rhyme within very narrow bounds. A thought of any extent, cannot be redu|ced within its compa&s;s. The &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be curtailed and broken into pieces, to make it &s;quare with the curtne&s;s of melody: and it is obvious, that &s;hort periods afford no latitude for inver&s;ion. I have examined this point with the greater accuracy, in or|der to give a ju&s;t notion of blank ver&s;e; and to &s;how that a &s;light difference in form may produce a very great difference in &s;ub&s;tance. Blank ver&s;e has the &s;ame pau&s;es and ac|cents with rhyme; and a pau&s;e at the end of every line, like what concludes the fir&s;t line of a couplet. In a word, the rules of
<PB N="438" REF="439">
melody in blank ver&s;e, are the &s;ame that obtain with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t line of a couplet. But luckily, being di&s;engaged from rhyme, or, in other words, from couplets, there is acce&s;s to make every line run into another, preci&s;ely as the fir&s;t line of a couplet may run into the &s;econd. There mu&s;t be a mu&s;ical pau&s;e at the end of every line; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary that it be accompanied with a pau&s;e in the &s;en&s;e. The &s;en&s;e may be carried on through dif|ferent lines; till a period of the utmo&s;t ex|tent be completed, by a full clo&s;e both in the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound. There is no re|&s;traint, other than that this full clo&s;e be at the end of a line. This re&s;traint is nece&s;&s;a|ry in order to pre&s;erve a coincidence be|twixt &s;en&s;e and &s;ound; which ought to be aimed at in general, and is indi&s;pen&s;able in the ca&s;e of a full clo&s;e, becau&s;e it has a &s;tri|king effect. Hence the aptitude of blank ver&s;e for inver&s;ion; and con&s;equently the lu&s;tre of its pau&s;es and accents; for which, as ob&s;erved above, there is greater &s;cope in inver&s;ion, than when words run in their na|tural order.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="440">
In the &s;econd &s;ection of this chapter it is &s;hown, that nothing contributes more than inver&s;ion to the force and elevation of lan|guage. The couplets of rhyme confine inver&s;ion within narrow limits. Nor would the elevation of inver&s;ion, were there acce&s;s for it in rhyme, be extremely concordant with the humbler tone of that &s;ort of ver&s;e. It is univer&s;ally agreed, that the loftine&s;s of Milton's &s;tyle &s;upports admira|bly the &s;ublimity of his &s;ubject; and it is not le&s;s certain, that the loftine&s;s of his &s;tyle ari&s;es chiefly from inver&s;ion. Shake|&s;pear deals little in inver&s;ion. But his blank ver&s;e, being a &s;ort of mea&s;ured pro&s;e, is perfectly well adapted to the &s;tage. La|boured inver&s;ion is there extremely impro|per, becau&s;e in dialogue it never can appear natural.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have con&s;idered the advantage of laying a&s;ide rhyme, with re&s;pect to that &s;uperior power of expre&s;&s;ion which ver&s;e acquires thereby. But this is not the only advantage of blank ver&s;e. It has another not le&s;s &s;ignal of its kind; and that is, of a more exten&s;ive and more complete melody.
<PB N="440" REF="441">
Its mu&s;ic is not, like that of rhyme, con|fined to a &s;ingle couplet; but takes in a great compa&s;s, &s;o as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to rival mu&s;ic properly &s;o called. The inter|vals betwixt its cadences may be long or &s;hort at plea&s;ure; and, by this means, its modulation, with re&s;pect both to richne&s;s and variety, is &s;uperior far to that of rhyme; and &s;uperior even to that of the Greek and Latin Hexameter.

<P>Comparing the Latin Hexameter and Eng|li&s;h heroic rhyme, the former has obviou&s;ly the advantage in the following particulars. It is greatly preferable as to arrangement, by the latitude it admits in placing the long and &s;hort &s;yllables. Secondly, the length of an Hexameter line hath a maje&s;tic air: ours, by its &s;hortne&s;s, is indeed more bri&s;k and lively, but much le&s;s fitted for the &s;ub|lime. And, thirdly, the long high-&s;ound|ing
<PB N="442" REF="443">
words that Hexameter admits, add greatly to its maje&s;ty. To compen&s;ate the&s;e advantages, Engli&s;h rhyme po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater number and greater variety both of pau&s;es and of accents. The&s;e two &s;orts of ver&s;e &s;tand indeed pretty much in oppo&s;i|tion: in the Hexameter, great variety of arrangement, none in the pau&s;es or accents: in the Engli&s;h rhyme, great variety in the pau&s;es and accents, very little in the ar|rangement.</P>
<P>In blank ver&s;e are united, in a good mea|&s;ure, the &s;everal properties of Latin Hexa|meter and Engli&s;h rhyme; and it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es be&s;ide many &s;ignal properties of its own. It is not confined, like a Hexameter, by a full clo&s;e at the end of every line; nor, like rhyme, by a full clo&s;e at the end of every couplet. This form of con&s;truction, which admits the lines to run into each other, gives it a &s;till greater maje&s;ty than ari&s;es from the length of a Hexameter line. By the &s;ame means, it admits inver&s;ion e|ven beyond the Latin or Greek Haxame|ter, which &s;uffer &s;ome confinement by the regular clo&s;es at the end of every line. In
<PB N="443" REF="444">
its mu&s;ic it is illu&s;trious above all. The melody of Hexameter ver&s;e, is circum&s;cri|bed to a line; and of Engli&s;h rhyme, to a couplet. The melody of blank ver&s;e is under no confinement, but enjoys the ut|mo&s;t privilege of which the melody of ver&s;e is &s;u&s;ceptible, and that is to run hand in hand with the &s;en&s;e. In a word, blank ver&s;e is &s;uperior to the Hexameter in many articles; and inferior to it in none, &s;ave in the latitude of arrangement, and in the u&s;e of long words.</P>
<P>In the French heroic ver&s;e, there are found, on the contrary, all the defects of the Latin Hexameter and Engli&s;h rhyme, without the beauties of either. Subjected to the bondage of rhyme, and to the full clo&s;e at the end of each couplet, it is fur|ther peculiarly di&s;gu&s;tful by the uniformity of its pau&s;es and accents. The line inva|riably is divided by the pau&s;e into two equal parts, and the accent is invariably placed before the pau&s;e.

Here every circum&s;tance contributes to a mo&s;t tedious uniformity. A con&s;tant re|turn of the &s;ame pau&s;e and of the &s;ame ac|cent, as well as an equal divi&s;ion of every line; by which the latter part always an|&s;wers to the former, and fatigues the ear without intermi&s;&s;ion or change. I cannot &s;et this matter in a better light, than by pre&s;enting to the reader a French tran&s;la|tion of the following pa&s;&s;age of Milton.

Here the &s;en&s;e is fairly tran&s;lated, the words are of equal power, and yet how in|ferior the melody!</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="447">
I take the liberty to add here a &s;pecula|tion, which, though collateral only, ari&s;es naturally from the &s;ubject, and &s;hall be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in a few words. Many attempts have been made to introduce Hexameter ver&s;e into the living languages, but without &s;ucce&s;s. The Engli&s;h language, I am in|clined to believe, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of this melody; and my rea&s;ons are the&s;e. Fir&s;t, the poly&s;yllables in Latin and Greek are finely diver&s;ified by long and &s;hort &s;yllables, a circum&s;tance that qualifies them for the melody of Hexameter ver&s;e. Ours are ex|tremely ill qualified for this &s;ervice, becau&s;e they &s;uperabound in &s;hort &s;yllables. Se|condly, the bulk of our mono&s;yllables are arbitrary with regard to length, which is an unlucky circum&s;tance in Hexameter. Cu&s;tom, as ob&s;erved above, may render fa|miliar a long or &s;hort pronunciation of the &s;ame word: but the mind wavering be|twixt the two &s;ounds, cannot be &s;o much affected with either, as with a word that hath always the &s;ame &s;ound; and for that rea&s;on, arbitrary &s;ounds are ill fitted for a melody which is chiefly &s;upported
<PB N="447" REF="448">
by quantity. In Latin and Greek Hexa|meter, invariable &s;ounds direct and a&s;cer|tain the melody: Engli&s;h Hexameter would be de&s;titute of melody, unle&s;s by artful pronunciation; becau&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity the bulk of its &s;ounds mu&s;t be arbitrary. The pronunciation is ea&s;y in a &s;imple move|ment of alternate &s;hort and long &s;yllables; but would be perplexing and unplea&s;ant in the diver&s;ified movement of Hexameter ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Rhyme makes &s;o great a figure in mo|dern poetry, as to de&s;erve a &s;olemn trial. I have for that rea&s;on re&s;erved it to be ex|amined with &s;ome deliberation; in order to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, its peculiar beauties, and the degree of merit it is intitled to. The fir&s;t view of this &s;ubject leads naturally to the following reflection, <Q REND="inline">"That rhyme having no relation to &s;entiment, nor any effect upon the ear other than a mere jingle, ought to be bani&s;hed all com|po&s;itions of any dignity, as affording but a trifling and childi&s;h plea&s;ure."</Q> It will al&s;o be ob&s;erved,  <Q REND="inline">"That a jingle of words

<P>The&s;e arguments are &s;pecious, and have undoubtedly &s;ome weight. Yet, on the o|ther hand, it ought to be con&s;idered, that rhyme, in later times, has become univer|&s;al among men as well as children; and that to give it a currency, it mu&s;t have &s;ome foundation in human nature. In fact, it has been &s;ucce&s;sfully employ'd by poets of genius, in their &s;erious and grave compo&s;i|tions, as well as in tho&s;e which are more light and airy. Here, in weighing autho|rity
<PB N="449" REF="450">
again&s;t argument, the balance &s;eems to hang pretty even; and therefore, to come at any thing deci&s;ive, we mu&s;t pierce a little deeper.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic has great power over the &s;oul; and may be &s;ucce&s;sfully employ'd to in|flame or &s;ooth our pa&s;&s;ions, if not actually to rai&s;e them. A &s;ingle &s;ound, however &s;weet, is not mu&s;ic; but a &s;ingle &s;ound re|peated after proper intervals, may have an effect upon the mind, by rou&s;ing the at|tention and keeping the hearer awake. A variety of &s;imilar &s;ounds, &s;ucceeding each other after regular intervals, mu&s;t have a &s;till &s;tronger effect. This is applicable to rhyme, which con&s;i&s;ts in the connec|tion that two ver&s;e-lines have by clo&s;ing with two words &s;imilar in &s;ound. And con&s;idering deliberately the effect that this may have; we find, that it rou&s;es the atten|tion, and produceth an emotion moderately gay without dignity or elevation. Like the murmurings of a brook gliding through pebbles, it calms the mind when perturbed, and gently rai&s;es it when &s;unk. The&s;e ef|fects are &s;carce perceived when the whole
<PB N="450" REF="451">
poem is in rhyme; but are extremely re|markable by contra&s;t, in the couplets which clo&s;e the &s;everal acts of our later tragedies. The tone of the mind is &s;en&s;ibly varied by them, from angui&s;h, di&s;tre&s;s, or melancho|ly, to &s;ome degree of ea&s;e and alacrity. For the truth of this ob&s;ervation, I appeal to the &s;peech of Jane Shore in the fourth act, when her doom was pronounced by Glo'|&s;ter; to the &s;peech of Lady Jane Gray at the end of the fir&s;t act; and to that of Ca|li&s;ta, in the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> when &s;he leaves the &s;tage, about the middle of the third act. The &s;peech of Alicia, at the clo&s;e of the fourth act of <HI>Jane Shore,</HI> puts the matter beyond doubt. In a &s;cene of deep di&s;tre&s;s, the rhymes which fini&s;h the act, produce a certain gaiety and chearfulne&s;s, far from according with the tone of the pa&s;&s;ion.<Q><SP>

<P>Having de&s;cribed, the be&s;t way I can, the impre&s;&s;ion that rhyme makes on the mind; I proceed to examine whether rhyme be proper for any &s;ubject, and to what &s;ubjects in particular it is be&s;t &s;uited. Great and elevated &s;ubjects, which have a powerful influence, claim ju&s;tly the pre|cedence in this inquiry. In the chapter of grandeur and &s;ublimity, it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, that a grand or &s;ublime object, in&s;pires a warm enthu&s;ia&s;tic emotion di&s;daining &s;trict regularity and order. This ob&s;ervation is applicable to the pre&s;ent point. The mo|derately-enlivening mu&s;ic of rhyme, gives a tone to the mind very different from that of grandeur and &s;ublimity. Suppo&s;ing then
<PB N="452" REF="453">
an elevated &s;ubject to be expre&s;&s;ed in rhyme, what mu&s;t be the effect? The intimate union of the mu&s;ic with the &s;ubject, pro|duces an intimate union of their emotions; one in&s;pired by the &s;ubject, which tends to elevate and expand the mind; and one in|&s;pired by the mu&s;ic, which, confining the mind within the narrow limits of regular cadency and &s;imilar &s;ound, tends to prevent all elevation above its own pitch. Emotions &s;o little concordant, cannot in union have a happy effect.</P>
<P>But it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to rea&s;on upon a ca&s;e, that never did, and probably never will happen, <HI>viz.</HI> an important &s;ubject clo|thed in rhyme, and yet &s;upported in its ut|mo&s;t elevation. A happy thought or warm expre&s;&s;ion, may at times give a &s;udden bound upward; but it requires a genius greater than has hitherto exi&s;ted, to &s;upport a poem of any length in a tone much more elevated than that of the melody. Ta&s;&s;o and Ario&s;to ought not to be made ex|ceptions, and &s;till le&s;s Voltaire. And after all, where the poet has the dead weight of rhyme con&s;tantly to &s;truggle with, how
<PB N="453" REF="454">
can we expect an uniform elevation in a high pitch; when &s;uch elevation, with all the &s;upport it can receive from language, re|quires the utmo&s;t effort of the human ge|nius?</P>
<P>But now, admitting rhyme to be an unfit dre&s;s for grand and lofty images; it has one advantage however, which is, to rai&s;e a low &s;ubject to its own degree of elevation. Ad|di&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N^o 285.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"That rhyme, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, throws the language off from pro&s;e, and very often makes an indifferent phra&s;e pa&s;s unregarded; but where the ver&s;e is not built upon rhymes, there, pomp of &s;ound and energy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;upport the &s;tyle and keep it from falling into the flatne&s;s of pro&s;e."</Q> This effect of rhyme is remarkable in the French ver&s;e, which, being &s;imple and natural and in a good mea&s;ure unqualified for inver&s;ion, rea|dily &s;inks down to pro&s;e where it is not ar|tificially &s;upported. Rhyme, by rou&s;ing the mind, rai&s;es it &s;omewhat above the
<PB N="454" REF="455">
tone of ordinary language: rhyme there|fore is indi&s;pen&s;able in the French tragedy; and may be proper even for their comedy. Voltaire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to his <HI>O Edipus,</HI> and in his di&s;cour&s;e upon tragedy, prefixed to the tragedy of <HI>Brutus.</HI></NOTE> a&s;&s;igns this very rea&s;on for adhe|ring to rhyme in the&s;e compo&s;itions. He indeed candidly owns, that even with the &s;upport of rhyme, the tragedies of his coun|try are little better than conver&s;ation-pieces. This &s;hows, that the French language is weak, and an improper dre&s;s for any grand &s;ubject. Voltaire was &s;en&s;ible of this im|perfection; and yet Voltaire attempted an epic poem in that language.</P>
<P>The chearing and enlivening power of rhyme, is &s;till more remarkable in poems of &s;hort lines, where the rhymes return upon the ear in a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. And for that rea&s;on, rhyme is perfectly well ad|apted to gay, light, and airy &s;ubjects. Witne&s;s the following.

For this rea&s;on, &s;uch frequent rhymes are very improper for any &s;evere or &s;erious pa&s;|&s;ion: the di&s;&s;onance betwixt the &s;ubject and the modulation, is very &s;en&s;ibly felt. Witne&s;s the following.<Q><L>Ardito ti renda,</L>

Rhyme is not le&s;s unfit for deep di&s;tre&s;s, than for &s;ubjects elevated and lofty; and for that rea&s;on has been long di&s;u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h and Italian tragedy. In a work, where the &s;ubject is &s;erious though not e|levated, it has not a good effect; becau&s;e the airine&s;s of the modulation agrees not with the gravity of the &s;ubject. The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> which treats a &s;ubject great and important, would &s;how much better in blank ver&s;e. Sportive love, mirth, gaiety, humour, and ridicule, are the province of rhyme. The boundaries a&s;&s;igned it by na|ture, were extended in barbarous and illi|terate ages, and in its u&s;urpations it has long been protected by cu&s;tom. But ta&s;te in the fine arts, as well as in morals, im|proves daily; and makes a progre&s;s, &s;lowly indeed, but uniformly, towards perfection: and there is no rea&s;on to doubt, that rhyme in Britain will in time be forc'd to abandon its unju&s;t conque&s;ts, and to confine it&s;elf within its natural limits.</P>
<P>Having thrown out what occurred upon rhyme, I clo&s;e the &s;ection with a general
<PB N="457" REF="458">
ob&s;ervation. The melody of articulate &s;ound &s;o powerfully inchants the mind, as to draw a vail over very gro&s;s faults and imper|fections. Of this power a &s;tronger example cannot be given, than the epi&s;ode of Ari|&s;taeus, which clo&s;es the fourth book of the <HI>Georgies.</HI> To renew a &s;tock of bees when the former is lo&s;t, Virgil a&s;&s;erts, that they will be produced in the intrails of a bullock, &s;lain and managed in a certain manner. This leads him to &s;ay, how this &s;trange receipt was invented; which is as follows. Ari&s;taeus having lo&s;t his bees by di&s;ea&s;e and famine, never dreams of employing the ordinary means for obtaining a new &s;tock; but, like a froward child, complains heavily of his misfortune to his mother Cyrene, a water|nymph. She advi&s;es him to con&s;ult Pro|teus, a &s;ea-god, not how he was to obtain a new &s;tock, but only by what fatality he had lo&s;t his former &s;tock; adding, that violence was nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e Proteus would &s;ay nothing voluntarily. Ari&s;taeus, &s;atisfied with this advice, though it gave him no pro&s;pect of repairing his lo&s;s, proceeds to execution. Proteus is catched &s;leeping,
<PB N="458" REF="459">
bound with cords, and compelled to &s;peak. He declares, that Ari&s;taeus was puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of his bees, for attempting the cha&s;tity of Euridice, the wife of Orpheus; &s;he having got her death by the &s;ting of a &s;erpent in flying his embraces. Proteus, who&s;e &s;ullenne&s;s ought to have been con|verted into wrath by the rough treatment he met with, becomes on a &s;udden cour|teous and communicative. He gives the whole hi&s;tory of Orpheus's expedition to hell in order to recover his &s;pou&s;e; a very entertaining &s;tory indeed, but without the lea&s;t relation to the affair on hand. Ari&s;taeus returning to his mother, is advi&s;ed to de|precate by &s;acrifices the wrath of Orpheus, who was now dead. A bullock is &s;acrificed, and out of the intrails &s;pring miraculou&s;ly a &s;warm of bees. How &s;hould this have led any mortal to think, that, without a miracle, the &s;ame might be obtained natu|rally, as is &s;uppo&s;ed in the receipt?</P>
