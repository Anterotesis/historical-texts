<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON Publick Credit.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ACCORDING to your De|&s;ire, I give you &s;ome &s;hort Con&s;iderations on Publick Credit; with a few Remarks on what has happen'd within the&s;e la&s;t Four Years.</P>
<P>By Publick Credit under the pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, is meant, the Value of the Debts owing by the Publick, com|monly called the Publick Funds.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
When the&s;e can be Sold at Market for the full Value of the Principal, Pub|lick Credit may be e&s;teemed good.</P>
<P>When they can be Sold for more, then Publick Credit is &s;aid to advance.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on that the&s;e Publick Funds have often varied in their Value, and been depre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome extraordinary De|gree, has chiefly ari&s;en from the Fear and Apprehen&s;ions of their real Security be|ing in danger from foreign Inva&s;ions, Force or Violence. Were it not for the&s;e Pannicks that every now and then po&s;&s;e&s;s Men's Minds, the Value of the Principal would &s;eldom alter in any great Degree.</P>
<P>Common Accidents in State Affairs, and the Arts of Stock-Jobbers, will always have &s;ome Influence.</P>
<P>But le&s;&s;er Alterations in their Value do very much depend on the Rate of In|tere&s;t for Money at the pre&s;ent, or any Expectation that it may &s;uddenly alter.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
As for In&s;tance,</P>
<P>If Men apprehend a great Demand of Money for Publick Service upon New Wars and Commotions, and that New Funds are to be created, they will generally run into an Opinion of turning as much as they can of their Publick Debts into ready Ca&s;h, in hopes of making con&s;ide|rable Gain by Loans, or purcha&s;ing &s;uch New Funds.</P>
<P>On the Contrary,</P>
<P>When the Publick is in a State of Se|renity, and the Intere&s;t of Funds duly paid, and no New Debts are incurr'd, there will then always remain a con&s;idera|ble Surplus in the Hands of private Men every Year, to be inve&s;ted again: And if no New Funds are erected, there will be more Buyers of the Old ones.</P>
<P>This naturally gives an Advance to what we call Publick Credit, and tends to le&s;&s;ening the Rate of Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>For &s;o long as the Publick Debts or Funds are in Reputation, and carry an Advance of Price, they are equal to &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="5">
much Money, and are to be con&s;idered as &s;o much real Ca&s;h; at lea&s;t whil&s;t Books are open for their immediate Transfer when &s;old.</P>
<P>What Influence then hath &s;uch a Bulk of Money, with re&s;pect to Land or Trade?</P>
<P>As for Trade, it need only be &s;aid, that Plenty of Money is the very Life of it; and al&s;o as it influences the Rate of Intere&s;t, by which means the Nation is enabled to carry on its Commerce in &s;ome mea&s;ure equal with its Neighbours.</P>
<P>But what re&s;pect hath this to Land?</P>
<P>It is not many Years ago, &s;ince an un|happy Di&s;tinction was &s;et on Foot, be|tween the Landed and the Money'd In|tere&s;t; from whence &s;trange Notions have been from time to time advanced, to the great Detriment of both.</P>
<P>Whereas the&s;e two Intere&s;ts are &s;o mix'd and blended together, that they mu&s;t be equally regarded by every one that would pur&s;ue the true Intere&s;t of his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
In former Times, the Value of Land was reckon'd by the Quantity of Cattle, or of Corn that it would produce; and is &s;o &s;till in &s;ome <HI>Northern</HI> Parts.</P>
<P>But &s;ince Trade hath been carry'd on in all the Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> and by that means great Quantities of Coined Money have been every where current, and more e&s;pecially in <HI>England</HI>; the true Value of an E&s;tate in Land, as well as all other Things, is only known by the Sum of Money it can be &s;old for.</P>
<P>This Value will always vary, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of Money.</P>
<P>He that recollects and compares the pre&s;ent Value of the Landed E&s;tates in <HI>England</HI> with what they were Fifty Years behind us, will certainly find a very great Difference.</P>
<P>Four Years Purcha&s;e will amount to more than Fifty Millions. For no Body will &s;uppo&s;e the Land-Tax to be the true&s;t Rule to go by in &s;uch Computati|ons as the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
And not only the Value of a Landed E&s;tate is thus increas'd, by the Plenty of Money, but the Improvement of that E&s;tate is al&s;o much enlarged, and the Rents advanced.</P>
<P>For as the Product of Land is more or le&s;s, according to the Stock that is em|ployed upon it; &s;o will that Stock natu|rally increa&s;e, if Money be &s;tirring, and Intere&s;t at a low Rate.</P>
<P>If therefore the Value of Land be thus mended by the Plenty of Money, and this Plenty ari&s;es by the Increa&s;e of Pub|lick Credit;</P>
<P>It will follow,</P>
<P>That if Publick Credit be depre&s;s'd, the Value of Land will &s;ink in &s;ome Proportion.</P>
<P>And no Violence can be offer'd to what is call'd the Money'd Intere&s;t, but what will al&s;o affect the Landed E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Publick Credit Four Years ago was at a very great Streight, and though legal Intere&s;t was then at Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> yet
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Publick Debts that carried but Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> were &s;old at Par, and &s;ome of them at more.</P>
<P>There was then a hopeful Opportunity for le&s;&s;ening the Publick Debts; and very ea&s;y had it been to have reduced the Inte|re&s;t from Five to Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> which was the true Way to have put the Publick Funds upon the Foot of di&s;charging them|&s;elves by their own Annual Surplus.</P>
<P>Which Surplus would have increa&s;ed every Year, and by that means have &s;till given a greater Value to the Funds, and affected the Rate of Intere&s;t, and con&s;e|quently have rais'd the Price of Land in &s;ome Proportion.</P>
<P>This was the Opinion and Advice of Men, who were then thought to have &s;ome Knowledge in the Affairs of Pub|lick Credit.</P>
<P>But this Advice was rejected; and a Scheme put into the Hands of &s;ome Am|bitious and Avaritious Men then in Pub|lick Station, who pu&s;h'd it through the la&s;t H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ns with impetu|ous Violence, and &s;upported it with the Grant of exorbitant Powers.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
Which Powers had never been obtai|ned, without the additional Aid of &s;ome in the Landed Intere&s;t, who were drawn in (&s;ome of them very innocently) by the Lucre of fictitious Stock; by which they were given to under&s;tand, That if the Project could be carried through, they &s;hould be great Gainers; if not, they could be no Lo&s;ers, for they were to disbur&s;e no Money.</P>
<P>Strange it is, that &s;uch Powers &s;hould ever have been put in the Hands of Men, who had given no great Proof of their Knowledge in Bu&s;ine&s;s relating to Publick Credit, and &s;oon di&s;covered them&s;elves in the Execution of tho&s;e Powers they were intru&s;ted with.</P>
<P>Powers, by which all Men were in|vited and encouraged to become Game|&s;ters, or to hazard their E&s;tates in an un|circum&s;cribed Lottery.</P>
<P>And the common Creditors of the Publick were in a manner con&s;trained to bring in their Annuities, for fear of the exorbitant Power given the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Managers, to lock up their E&s;tates during Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
But whereever the Fault may be laid; whether on the wild Attempts of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Directors in the Execution of their Scheme, or on the Want of pro|per Care in tho&s;e who ought to have &s;u|pervi&s;ed the Management, or on the In|fatuation that &s;pread by degrees over the whole Nation:</P>
<P>Or whether the Fault mu&s;t be laid on all the&s;e put together: The unhappy Event was, that it &s;oon brought Ruin on many great Families; and Numbers of in|nocent deluded People were reduced, from a comfortable way of Living, to Poverty, Pri&s;ons, and Exile; to &s;ee their Families peri&s;h for Want of Bread, and them&s;elves to end their Days in Sorrow.</P>
<P>Could a perfect Li&s;t be made of the&s;e unhappy Sufferers, what a di&s;mal Ca|ta&s;tophre would it appear to future Ages!</P>
<P>Whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, Stock-Jobbing Brokers, and Common Game&s;ters, were put in a Capacity of leaving va&s;t E&s;tates to their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And this Scheme did not only undo private Families, and bring Confu&s;ion on our Commerce, to its inconceivable Da|mage;
<PB N="12" REF="11">
but it al&s;o brought the State it &s;elf into the utmo&s;t Danger.</P>
<P>Happy was it for us, that but few did know that we were &s;o near the Brink of Ruin.</P>
<P>For the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Managers, from mi|&s;taken Notions about <HI>Exchequer</HI> Bills, would needs imagine, that the taking this Branch of Credit into their own Hands, would be of va&s;t Service to them.</P>
<P>But when the Shock came, their Error &s;oon appear'd; for the <HI>Exchequer</HI> was drained of Specie, and no &s;uitable Pro|vi&s;ion made for circulating the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Bills.</P>
<P>For want of which, the very Founda|tions of current Credit were like to have been blown up, and a total Stop of all Payments mu&s;t &s;oon have follow'd.</P>
<P>Such a Di&s;tre&s;s, when the Minds of Men were agitated with Fury, Violence, and De&s;pair, might have thrown the Na|tion into an Aby&s;s of Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
And it was an unhappy Circum&s;tance at that Time, that His Maje&s;ty's Affairs requir'd his Pre&s;ence abroad.</P>
<P>However, the Few that were left at Helm interpo&s;ed with their &s;ea&s;onable Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and perhaps upon a &s;trict Review it will be found, that no|thing el&s;e but &s;uch a Jumblement of va|riegated Mea&s;ures, as were then pur&s;ued, could have pre&s;erved Things in any to|lerable Order.</P>
<P>The Reflection on this unfortunate Scheme is the more melancholy, becau&s;e it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Oppo&s;ition to ano|ther, that was then thought by impartial Men to be much more advantageous for the Publick.</P>
<P>A Propo&s;al was forced from the <HI>Bank</HI>; for by the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Scheme it plainly appeared, that nothing le&s;s was intended than a Demolition of that Corporation.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al that thus came to be of|fer'd by the <HI>Bank,</HI> was founded on a plain natural Scheme of the low Rate Intere&s;t was then reduced to.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
For it may be remember'd, that at the Time of their Propo&s;al, the Annuities which carry'd 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, and tho&s;e which carry'd but 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> were much about the &s;ame Value at Market.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this was plain, tho&s;e at 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> expected to be paid off by others, who were willing to advance the Money at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore the 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> offer'd by the <HI>Bank</HI> as a <HI>Proemium,</HI> was nothing more than what the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the An|nuities were willing to part with.</P>
<P>Or it may be thus &s;tated.</P>
<P>There was then a general Di&s;po&s;ition to write the Annuities into <HI>Bank</HI> Stock, at the Rate of about 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Ad|vance; Twenty of which was to be given to the Publick; the other Thirty being added to the common Stock of the <HI>Bank,</HI> would have enabled them to con|tinue their Dividend of 7 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for many Years.</P>
<P>Which Dividend would in all com|mon Events have &s;upported their Stock at a higher Price.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
And there is no doubt, but as Things then &s;tood, the <HI>Bank</HI> would have carry'd through their Propo&s;al without any great Difficulty; notwith&s;tanding the dark In|&s;inuations to the contrary, by &s;ome who have never yet thought fit to offer their Objections in publick.</P>
<P>Some indeed have imagin'd, that if the <HI>Bank</HI>'s Propo&s;al had been e&s;tabli&s;h'd, they would have run into the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, or have been driven at lea&s;t, by the warm Heads of tho&s;e Times, to the &s;ame Exce&s;&s;es that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> fell into.</P>
<P>But this was impo&s;&s;ible:</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the <HI>Bank</HI> in their Propo&s;al had fix'd a Rate for all the long Annuitants that would come in&mdash;And would cer|tainly have &s;et a propottionable one for the &s;hort Annuities.</P>
<P>If Stock therefore was to be had at one certain Rate for &s;o great a Sum as both Sort of Annuities amounted to, there could be no room for &s;uch extravagant Attempts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
The Propo&s;al of the <HI>Bank</HI> was indeed accepted; and that it was afterwards &s;et by, is owing to &s;ome Men then in Power, who in a very extraordinary manner ob|tain'd Leave for the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Projectors to amend their Scheme.</P>
<P>This was the fatal Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>For in the Interim, the Men who were infatuated with their Project, and full of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> Notions, imagin'd with them|&s;elves, that they might &s;afely venture to outbid the cautious Men of the <HI>Bank.</HI></P>
<P>Not con&s;idering, that their Propo&s;al was founded upon the Lowne&s;s of Inte|re&s;t, which was not po&s;&s;ible to be main|tained without the nece&s;&s;ary Methods of managing Credit; and the&s;e were not like to be compa&s;s'd but by a <HI>Bank,</HI> when in the Height of Reputation.</P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Bank</HI> may be &s;aid to have run &s;ome Hazard in their Propo&s;al, had any unhappy Accident fallen out during the &s;hort Space in which it was to have been perfected.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
But as the Event hath been, that Tran|quillity hath attended our Affairs Abroad, it &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that they would have compleated the Propo&s;al on their Part.</P>
<P>Which would have been followed with Peace at Home, and prevented Plots and Con&s;piracies, founded upon the Di&s;con|tents of unhappy Sufferers in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>And al&s;o at this Day have le&s;&s;en'd the Publick Debts near one Sixth Part.</P>
<P>But whether any &s;uch Scheme, how|ever profitable for the pre&s;ent, was real|ly fit to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, is not the Subject of the&s;e Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the Opportunity is now lo&s;t, and we are left to con&s;ider of proper Mea&s;ures for maintaining publick Credit, which of late hath begun to re|vive.</P>
<P>This is not effectually to be done, but by le&s;&s;ening the publick Debt; for with|out &s;ome rational Pro&s;pect of that, Men's Hearts will fail, the Opinion of publick
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Security will langui&s;h, and its Value di|mini&s;h.</P>
<P>Schemes and Projects we have &s;een, and the Mi&s;chiefs that have attended 'em; it will be time therefore to return to the &s;afe Method; and That is the Lowering of Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Not by Force or Violence; no, nor by Coercive Laws; but by a regular, &s;teady, careful Attendance to its own natural Motions.</P>
<P>If Intere&s;t &s;hall &s;ettle but at the Rate it was four Years ago, there would then be a fair Expectation again, that the Funds appropriated to the Publick Debts, will, in Proce&s;s of Time, di&s;charge them&s;elves by a gradual Increa&s;e of the yearly Sur|plus.</P>
<P>And for the future Support of Credit, it may be u&s;eful,</P>
<P>That there &s;hould be repeated Decla|rations, and firm Re&s;olutions to maintain Publick Faith.</P>
<P>And that the annual Expence of the Publick be reduced as far as ever the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and Safety of Affairs will per|mit.</P>
<P>And al&s;o, that the Funds already e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, be managed with the utmo&s;t Fru|gality, Probity, and Application.</P>
<P>This la&s;t is a wide Field, and many Things readily offer them&s;elves, which cannot be crowded in here; 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, there's room enough for impro|ving the Duties, and le&s;&s;ening the extra|vagant Charge in Collecting.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore humbly offer'd to the Con&s;ideration of Gentlemen, to con&s;i|der how far their own Intere&s;t is con|cern'd in the Pre&s;ervation of Publick Credit.</P>
<P>The Value of their E&s;tates will be af|fected with its Ri&s;e or Fall.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;ing the Publick Debts to be 50 Millions, and that Cum &s;hould not be One Sixth Part of the Landed E&s;tates, their Damage in ca&s;e of any publick Cala|mity, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure be proportio|nable; for though One may lo&s;e his Whole, and the Other but his One Sixth, yet in one &s;en&s;e their Lo&s;s will be equal.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
Thus, Sir, I have laid before you &s;ome Thoughts, that po&s;&s;ibly may be of u&s;e to you in future Debates.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be own'd, 'tis a va&s;t Debt we have to encounter with.</P>
<P>If we look back to the Revolution, and &s;uppo&s;e at that time any one &s;hould have affirmed, That in about Thirty Years the Subjects would pay above 150 Millions in Taxes, and that yet a Debt &s;hould remain of 50 Millions more, it would have been thought utterly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed amazing, to think that wi&s;e and great Men at the Head of Affairs, &s;hould from time to time have run the Nation into &s;o great a Debt.</P>
<P>This, with all the Ob&s;ervation I could ever make, &s;eems to be owing to the frequent Change of Mini&s;tries in the late Reigns;</P>
<P>Who, by &s;hifting Hands, and new Friends, never fail'd to e&s;tabli&s;h New Funds, and create New Debts for their pre&s;ent Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
And it is pretty much owing to the &s;ame Cau&s;e, that there never was any &s;uitable Enquiry into the Mi&s;application of Publick Money, nor the many Frauds, by which the Publick Debts have been &s;o much increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions generally ended in &s;ome Je&s;t or other; and &s;erv'd chiefly to gratify the Pa&s;&s;ions of one Party in Op|po&s;ition to another, without producing any real Good to the Publick.</P>
<P>It may be thought by &s;ome, that it is not yet too late to enter upon &s;o good a Work; but there have been &s;o many Acts of Indemnity, and our Laws are &s;o ten|der with re&s;pect to Property, e&s;pecially when it hath been once alienated, that it is vain now to expect any Publick Ad|vantage by &s;uch Enquires.</P>
<P>He that would undertake any Part there|in, will get nothing but Envy and Malice to him&s;elf, and little or no Profit to the Publick.</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e I know is a&s;&s;igned for this great Debt, which was chiefly accu|mulated in the la&s;t Reign; and that is, That <HI>France</HI> being pre&s;s'd with the War,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
extended, or rather forced Paper Money to a prodigious Length; and this obliged <HI>England,</HI> as well as other of the Allies, to &s;tretch their Credit.</P>
<P>But they ought to have con&s;idered, that <HI>France</HI> by its D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ck Power could reduce tho&s;e Debts, as we find they have done, but not without the Impoveri&s;hment of their People.</P>
<P>We have now indeed an Opportunity of plowing with their Heifer; but tho&s;e Methods are &s;o contrary to the Liberties of our happy Con&s;titution, that nothing of that Nature can be attempted, without Hazard of the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>If then we mu&s;t remain with this hea|vy Load upon us, let us make it as u&s;e|ful as we can.</P>
<P>And if it will tend to the multiplying our Money, or that which is near equal to it, and thereby enrich our Land, and increa&s;e our Trade, let us improve it to the&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that many are frightned with the Apprehen&s;ion of great Difficul|ties, &s;hould we fall into any open War.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
Yet I think that this Heap of Publick Credit, may, by a right Management, be render'd not only u&s;eful, but highly ad|vantageous in ca&s;e of any defen&s;ive War; and I have no Notion of any other.</P>
<P>But as I hope &s;uch a Calamity is far di&s;tant from us, I will not trouble you with any thing on that Subject.</P>
<P>I had thought al&s;o to have de&s;ired your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in preventing Mi&s;chiefs by Stock-Jobbing; but when I con&s;ider how that Gaming Vice has tinged our Morals, I am afraid the Times will not beat an adequate Remedy.</P>
