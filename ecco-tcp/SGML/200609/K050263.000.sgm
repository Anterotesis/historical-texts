<HEAD>And what if the Pretender &s;hould come? OR, SOME Con&s;iderations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the Danger of the Pretender is real|ly &s;o great as the Noi&s;e which &s;ome make about it &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, if the Hopes of his Coming are &s;o well grounded, as &s;ome of his Friends &s;eem to boa&s;t, it behoves us who are to be the Sub|jects of the Approaching Revolution, which his Succe&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bring with it, to apply our&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to examine what our Part will be in the Play, that &s;o we may prepare our&s;elves to act as becomes us, both with Re&s;pect to the Government we are now under, and with Re&s;pect to the Government we may be under, when the Succe&s;s he promi&s;es him&s;elf &s;hall (if ever it &s;hall) an&s;wer his Expectation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
In order to this it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, with what Plainne&s;s the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e will admit, the &s;everal Appear|ances of the Thing it&s;elf. (1.) <HI>As they are</HI> offered to us by the re&s;pective Parties who are for or again&s;t it. (2.) <HI>As they</HI> really appear by an Impartial Deduction from them both, without the lea&s;t Bya&s;s either to one Side or other; that &s;o the People of <HI>Britain</HI> may &s;ettle and compo&s;e their Thoughts a little in this Great, and at pre&s;ent Popular Debate, and may neither be terrified or affrighted with Mi&s;chiefs, which have no Rea&s;on or Foundation in them, and which give no Ground for their Apprehen&s;ions; and on the other Hand, may not promi&s;e to them&s;elves greater Things from the Pretender, if he &s;hould come hither, than he will be able to perform for them; in order to this we are to con&s;ider the Pretender in his Per&s;on, and in his Circum&s;tances. (1.) The Per|&s;on who we call the Pretender: It has been &s;o much debated, and &s;uch &s;trong Parties have been made on both Sides to prove or di&s;prove the Legitimacy of his Birth, that it &s;eems needle&s;s here to enter into that Di&s;pute; the Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Furious Oppo&s;ers of the Name and Intere&s;t of the Pretender, openly grants his Legitimacy, and pretends to ar|gue
<PB N="5" REF="4">
again&s;t his Admi&s;&s;ion from Principles and Foundations of his own Forming; we &s;hall let alone his Principles and Foundati|ons here, as we do his Arguments, and on|ly take him by the Handle which he fairly gives us, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he grants <HI>the Per&s;on of the Pretender Legitimate</HI>; if this be &s;o, if the Per&s;on we contend about be the Lawful true Son of King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen, the Di&s;pute whether he be the Real Son of the King will be quite out of the Que&s;tion; becau&s;e by the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of the whole World, a Child Born in Wedlock &s;hall inherit, as Heir of the Mother's Husband, whether Begotten by him, as his Real Father, or not. Now to come at the true De&s;ign of this Work, the Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to hear (as above) what either Side have to &s;ay to this Point. The Friends of his Birth and Succe&s;&s;ion argue upon it thus, if the Per&s;on be lawfully Begotten, <HI>that is,</HI> if Born really of the Body of the Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> during the Life of King <HI>James,</HI> he was without any Exception his Lawful Son; <HI>if</HI> he was his Lawful Son, he was his Lawful Heir; <HI>if</HI> he was his Law|ful Heir, why is he not our Lawful King? <HI>Since</HI> Hereditary Right is Indefea&s;ible, and is lately acknowledged to be &s;o; and that the Doctrine of Hereditary Right being In|defea&s;ible, is a Church of <HI>England,</HI> Doctrine
<PB N="6" REF="5">
ever received by the Church, and in&s;e|parable from the true Members of the Church, the contrary being the &s;tigmati|zing Character of Republicans, King-killers, Enemies to Monarchy, Presbyterians, and Phanaticks: The Enemies of the Birth and Succe&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;on called the Pre|tender argue upon it thus, <HI>That</HI> he is the Lawfully Begotten, or Son Born really of the Body of the Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of the late King <HI>James, they doubt</HI>; and they are ju&s;tified in doubting of it, becau&s;e no &s;ufficient Steps were taken in the proper Sea&s;on of it, <HI>either before his Birth,</HI> to convince &s;uch Per&s;ons as were more immediately concerned to know the Truth of it, that the Queen was really with Child, which might have been done pa&s;t all Contradiction at that Time, more than ever after: <HI>Or at his Birth,</HI> to have &s;uch Per&s;ons as were more immediately con|cern'd, <HI>&s;uch as Her Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty,</HI> &amp;c. thoroughly convinc'd of the Queen being really deliver'd of a Child, by being Pre&s;ent at the Time of the Queen's Labour and De|livery. This being omitted, which was the Affirmative, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> which ought to have been proved, we ought not to be concerned in the Proof of the Negative, which by the Nature of the Thing could not be equally certain; and therefore we might be ju&s;tly permitted to conclude, that the Child was
<PB N="7" REF="6">
a Spurious, Unfair Production, put upon the Nation; for which Rea&s;on we reject him, and have now, by a Legal and Ju&s;t Authority, depo&s;ed his Father and him, and &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> being Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>The Matter of his Title &s;tanding thus, divides the Nation into Two Parties, one Side for, and the other again&s;t, the Succe&s;|&s;ion, either of the Pretender, or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and either Side calling the other the Pretender; &s;o that if we were to u&s;e the Parties Language, we mu&s;t &s;ay, one Side is for, and the other Side again&s;t, either of the <HI>Pretenders</HI>; what the Vi&s;ible Probabi|lities of either of the&s;e Claims &s;ucceeding are, is not the Pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; the Nation appears at this Time &s;trangely agitated between the Fears of one Party, and the Hopes of the other, each extenuating and aggravating, as their &s;everal Parties and Affections guide them, by which the Publick Di&s;order is very much encrea&s;ed; what either of them have to alledge is our pre&s;ent Work to en|quire; but more particularly what are the real or pretended Advantages of the expect|ed Reign of him, who we are allow'd to di&s;tingui&s;h by the Name of <HI>the Pretender</HI>; for his Friends here would have very little to &s;ay to move us to receive him, if they were not able to lay before us &s;uch Pro|&s;pects
<PB N="8" REF="7">
of National Advantages, and &s;uch Views of Pro&s;perity, as would be &s;ufficient to prevail with tho&s;e who have their Eyes upon the Good of their Country, and of their Po&s;terity after them.</P>
<P>That then a Ca&s;e &s;o Popular, and of &s;o much Con&s;equence as this is, may not want &s;uch due Supports as the Nature of the Thing will allow, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the Advantages and good Con&s;equences of the Thing it&s;elf are &s;o many, and &s;o ea&s;ie to be &s;een as his Friends alledge; why &s;hould not the Good People of <HI>Britain</HI> be made ea&s;ie, and their Fears be turned into Peaceable Satisfa|ction, by &s;eeing that this Devil may not be &s;o Black as he is Painted; and that the Noi&s;e made of the Pretender and the frightful Things &s;aid of his Coming, and of his being receiv'd here, may not be made greater Scarecrows to us, than they really are; and <HI>after all that has been &s;aid, if</HI> it &s;hould appear that the Advantages of the Pretender's Succe&s;&s;ion are really greater to us, and the Dangers le&s;s to us, than tho&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>HANOVER,</HI> then much of their Dif|ficulties would be over, who &s;tanding Neu|ter as to Per&s;ons appear again&s;t the Preten|der, only becau&s;e they are made to believe &s;trange and terrible Things of what &s;hall befal the Nation in Ca&s;e of his Coming in, <HI>&s;uch as</HI> Popery, Slavery, <HI>French</HI> Power,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
de&s;troying of our Credit, and devouring our Funds, (as that Scandalous Scribler, the <HI>Review,</HI> has been labouring to &s;ugge&s;t,) with many other Things which we &s;hall endeavour to expo&s;e to you, as they de&s;erve. <HI>If</HI> we &s;ay it &s;hould appear then that the Dangers and Di&s;advantages of the Pretender's Succe&s;&s;ion are le&s;s than tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>HANOVER,</HI> who, becau&s;e of an Act of Parliament, you know mu&s;t not be called <HI>Pretenders</HI>; then there will re|main nothing more to be &s;aid on that Score, but the Debate mu&s;t be of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Ju&s;tice on either Side, for their Admittance, and there we que|&s;tion not but the Side we are really plead|ing for will have the Advantage.</P>
<P>To begin then with that mo&s;t Popular and Affrighting Argument now made U&s;e of, as the Bugbear of the People, again&s;t &s;everal other Things be&s;ides Jacobiti&s;m, we mean <HI>French Greatne&s;s:</HI> It is mo&s;t evi|dent that the Fear of this mu&s;t, by the Na|ture of the Thing, be effectually removed upon our receiving <HI>the Pretender</HI>; the Grounds and Rea&s;ons why <HI>French</HI> Great|ne&s;s is rendred Formidable to us, and &s;o much Weight &s;uppo&s;ed to be in it, that like the Name of <HI>Scanderberg,</HI> we fright our very Children with it, lye only in this, that we &s;ugge&s;t the King of <HI>France</HI> being a pro|fe&s;t

Enemy to the Peace, and the Liberty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will mo&s;t certainly, as &s;oon as he can a little recover him&s;elf, ex|erci&s;e all that Formidable Power to put the Pretender upon us, and not only to place him upon the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but to Maintain and Hold him up in it, again&s;t all the Oppo&s;ition, either of the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> or the Confederate Princes Leagued with the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> who are in the Intere&s;t of his Claim, or of his Party. Now it is evident, that upon a Peaceable ad|mitting this Per&s;on, whom they call the Pretender, to Receive and Enjoy the Crown here, all that Formidable Power becomes your Friend, and <HI>the being &s;o</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily take off from it every Thing that is called Terrible; fora&s;much as the greater Terror and Amu&s;ement the Power we ap|prehend really carries with it, the greater is the Tranquility and Satisfaction which accrues to us, when we have the Friend|&s;hip of that Power which was &s;o Formida|ble to us before: The Power of <HI>France</HI> is repre&s;ented at this Time very terrible, and the Writers who &s;peak of it apply it warm to our Imaginations, as that from whence we ought ju&s;tly to apprehend the Impo&s;&s;i|bility of keeping out the Pretender, and this, notwith&s;tanding they allow them&s;elves at the &s;ame Time to &s;uppo&s;e all the Confede|rate

Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to be Engaged, as well by their own Intere&s;t, as by the New Treaties of Barrier and Guarantee, to Sup|port and to A&s;&s;i&s;t the Claim of the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and his Party. Now if this Power be &s;o Great, and &s;o Formidable, as they alledge, will it not on the other Side add a Proportion of Encrea&s;e to our Sati&s;|faction, that this Power will be wholly in Friend&s;hip and League with us; and en|gaged to concern it&s;elf for the quieting our Fears of other Foreign Invaders; fora&s;much as having once concern'd it&s;elf to &s;et the Per&s;on of the Pretender upon the Throne, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but it &s;hall be equal|ly concern'd to Support and Maintain him in that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other Pro|jects of his Greatne&s;s and Glory with the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI>; in which it will be very much his Intere&s;t to &s;ecure him&s;elf from any Op|po&s;ition he might meet with from this Nati|on, or from &s;uch as might be rendred Pow|erful by our A&s;&s;i&s;tance. An Eminent In|&s;tance we have of this in the Mighty Efforts the <HI>French</HI> Nation have made for Planting, and Pre&s;erving when Planted, a Grand&s;on of <HI>France</HI> upon the Throne of <HI>Spain</HI>; and how Eminent are the Advantages to <HI>France</HI> from the Succe&s;s of that Undertaking; of what le&s;s Con&s;equence then would it be to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Augu&s;t Monarchy of <HI>France,</HI> to Secure and Engage to him&s;elf the con&s;tant Friend|&s;hip and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Power of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which he would nece&s;&s;arily do, by the placing this Per&s;on upon the Throne, who would thereby in Gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmo&s;t in Return to the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the carrying on his Glorious De&s;igns in the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> While then we become thus nece&s;&s;ary to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Rea&s;on dictates that he would be our Fa&s;t Friend, our Con&s;tant Confederate, our Allie, firmly engaged to Secure our Sovereign, and Protect our People from the In&s;ults and Attempts of all the World: Being thus engaged reciprocal|ly with the King of <HI>France,</HI> there mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be an End of all the Fears and Jealou&s;ies, of all the Apprehen&s;ions and Doubts, which now &s;o Amu&s;e us, and appear &s;o Formidable to us from the Pro&s;pect of the Power and Greatne&s;s of <HI>France</HI>; then we &s;hall on the contrary &s;ay to the World, the &s;tronger the King of <HI>France</HI> is, the bet|ter for the King of <HI>England</HI>; and what is be&s;t for the King, mu&s;t be &s;o for his Peo|ple; for it is a mo&s;t unnatural Way of Arguing, to &s;uppo&s;e the Intere&s;t of a King, and of his People, to be different from one another.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
And is not this then an Advantage in|comparably greater to <HI>Britain,</HI> when the Pretender &s;hall be upon the Throne, than any we can propo&s;e to our&s;elves in the pre|&s;ent unea&s;ie Po&s;ture of Affairs, which it mu&s;t be acknowledged we are in now, when we cannot &s;leep in Quiet, for the terrible Apprehen&s;ions of being over-run by the For|midable Power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Let us al&s;o con&s;ider the many other Ad|vantages which may accrue to this Nation, by a nearer Conjunction, and clo&s;er Union, with <HI>France,</HI> &s;uch as Encrea&s;e of Com|merce, Encouragement of Manufactures, Ballance of Trade; every one knows how va&s;t an Advantage we reaped by the <HI>French</HI> Trade in Former Times, and how many Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year we gain'd by it, when the Ballance of Trade between us and <HI>France</HI> run &s;o many Milli|ons of <HI>Livres</HI> Annually <HI>again&s;t</HI> the <HI>French</HI> by the va&s;t Exportation of our Goods to them, and the &s;mall Import which we re|ceiv'd from them again, and by the Con|&s;tant Flux of Money in <HI>Specie,</HI> which we drew from them every Year, upon Court Occa&s;ions, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Benefit of the Nation, and Enriching of the Subject, of which we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak here|after more fully.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
In the mean Time it were to be wi&s;hed that our People, who are &s;o bugbear'd with Words, and terrified with the Name of <HI>French, French Power, French Greatne&s;s,</HI> and the like, as if <HI>England</HI> could not Sub&s;i&s;t, and the Queen of <HI>England</HI> was not Able to keep upon Her Throne any longer than the King of <HI>France</HI> plea&s;ed, and that Her Maje&s;ty was going to be a meer Servant to the <HI>French</HI> King, would con&s;ider that this is an unan&s;werable Argument for the Coming of the Pretender, that we may make this &s;o Formidable Prince our Friend, have all his Power engaged in our Intere&s;t, and &s;ee him going on Hand in Hand with us, in the &s;ecuring us again&s;t all Sorts of Encroachments what&s;oever: For if the King of <HI>France</HI> be &s;uch an Invin|cible Mighty Monarch, that we are nothing in his Eyes, or in his Hands; and that nei|ther <HI>Britain,</HI> or all the Friends <HI>Britain</HI> can make, are able to deliver us from him; then it mu&s;t be our great Advantage to have the Pretender be our King, that we may be out of the Danger of this Formida|ble <HI>French</HI> Power, being our Enemy; and that on the other Hand, we may have &s;o Potent, &s;o Powerful, &s;o Invincible, a Prince be our Friend. The Ca&s;e is evidently laid down to every common Under&s;tanding, in the Example of <HI>Spain</HI>; <HI>till now,</HI> the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> for many Ages have been over-run,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and impoveri&s;hed, by their continued Wars with the <HI>French,</HI> and it was not doubted but one Time or other they would have been entirely conquered by the King of <HI>France,</HI> and have become a meer Province of <HI>France</HI>; whereas now, having but con|&s;ented to receive a King from the Hands of the invincible Monarch, they are made ea&s;ie as to the former Danger they were always in, are now mo&s;t &s;afe under the Protection of <HI>France</HI>; and he who before was their Terror, is now their Safety, and being &s;afe from him, it appears they are &s;o from all the World.</P>
<P>Would it not then be the manife&s;t Ad|vantage of this Nation to be likewi&s;e &s;e|cur'd from the dangerous Power of <HI>France,</HI> and make that Potentate our fa&s;t Friend, who it is &s;o apparent we are not able to re&s;i&s;t as an Enemy? This is reducing the <HI>French</HI> Power the &s;ofte&s;t Way, if not the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Way; for if it does not reduce the Power it&s;elf, it brings it into &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, as that all the Terror of it is removed, and we embrace that as our Safety and Satisfaction, which really is, and ought to be, our Terror and Aver&s;ion; this mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be our great Ad|vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
How &s;trange is it that none of our Peo|ple have yet thought of this Way of &s;ecu|ring their Native Country from the In&s;ults of <HI>France?</HI> Were but the Pretender once re|ceived as our King, we have no more Di&s;|putes with the King of <HI>France,</HI> he has no Pretence to Invade or Di&s;turb us; what a quiet World would it be with us in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, when the greate&s;t Monarch in the Univer&s;e &s;hould be our fa&s;t Friend, and be in our Intere&s;t to prevent any of the Incon|veniencies which might happen to us from the Di&s;gu&s;t of other Neighbours, who may be di&s;&s;atisfied with us upon other Accounts: As to the terrible Things which &s;ome Peo+ple fright us, and them&s;elves with, from the Influence which <HI>French</HI> Councils may have upon us, and of <HI>French</HI> Methods of Government being introduced among us; the&s;e we ought to e&s;teem only Clamours and Noi&s;e, rai&s;ed by a Party to amu&s;e and affright us; for pray let us enquire a little into them, and &s;ee if there be any Rea&s;on for us to be &s;o terrified at them; &s;uppo&s;e they were really what is alledged, which we hope they are not; <HI>for Example,</HI> the ab|&s;olute Dominion of the King of <HI>France</HI> over his Subjects, is &s;uch, &s;ay our People, as makes them Mi&s;erable; well, but let us examine then, are we not already mi&s;erable for Want of this Ab&s;olute Dominion?

In doing this they are all united together &s;o firmly, as if they had but one Heart, and one Mind, and that the King was the Soul of the Nation: What if they are <HI>what we fooli&s;hly call</HI> Slaves to the Ab&s;olute Will of their Prince? That Slavery to them is meer Liberty; they entertain no Notions of that fooli&s;h Thing <HI>Liberty,</HI> which we make &s;o much Noi&s;e about; nor have they any Oc|ca&s;ion of it, or any U&s;e for it if they had

it; they are as Indu&s;trious in Trade, as Vigorous in Pur&s;uit of their Affairs, go on with as much Courage, and are as well &s;ati&s;|fied when they have wrought hard 20 or 30 Years to get a little Money for the King to take away, as we are to get it for our Wives and Children; and as they plant Vines, and plow Lands, that the King and his Great Men may eat the Fruit thereof, they think it as great a Felicity as if they Eat it them&s;elves. The Badge of their Poverty, which we make &s;uch a Noi&s;e of, and In&s;ult them about &s;o much, (<HI>viz.</HI>) their Wooden Shoes, their Pea&s;ants make nothing of it; they &s;ay they are as happy in their Wooden Shoes, as our People are with their Luxury and Drunkenne&s;s; be&s;ides, do not our Poor People wear Iron Shoes, and Leather Doublets, and where is the Odds between them? All the Bu&s;ine&s;s for&s;ooth is this Trifle we call Liberty, which rather than be plagued with &s;o much Strife and Di&s;&s;en|tion about it as we are, who would be troubled with? Now it is evident <HI>the Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> which we &s;hould enjoy under the like Methods of Government here, which we hope for under the Happy Government of the Pretender, mu&s;t needs be a full Equivalent for all the pretended Rights and Priviledges which we &s;ay we &s;hall loo&s;e; and how will our Rights and

Privileges be lo&s;t? Will they not rather be Centred in our Common Receptacle, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Sovereign, who is according to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s happy Govern|ment the Common Magazine of Univer&s;al Privilege, communicating it to, and pre|&s;erving it for, the general U&s;e of his Subjects, as their Safety and Happine&s;s requires. Thus he protects their Commerce, encourages their Foreign Settlements, en|larges their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions Abroad, encrea&s;es their Manufactures, gives them Room for &s;preading their numerous Race over the World; at Home he rewards Arts and Sci|ences, cultivates Learning, employs innu|merable Hands in the Labours of the State, and the like; what if it be true that all they Gain is at his Mercy? Does he take it away, except when needful, for the Sup|port of his Glory and Grandeur, which is their Protection?

<P>Let us then be no more rendred unea&s;ie with the Notions, that with the Pretender we mu&s;t entertain <HI>French</HI> Methods of Go|vernment, &s;uch as Tyranny and Arbitrary Power; Tyranny is no more Tyranny, when improv'd for the Subjects Advantage; perhaps when we have tried it we may find it as much for our Good many Ways, nay, and more too, than our pre&s;ent Exor|bitant Liberties, e&s;pecially unle&s;s we can make a better U&s;e of them, and Enjoy them, without being always going by the Ears about them, as we &s;ee daily, not only with our Governours, but even with one ano|ther; a little <HI>French Slavery,</HI> though it be a frightful Word among us, <HI>that is,</HI> being made &s;o by Cu&s;tom, yet may do us a great deal of Good in the Main, as it may teach us not to <HI>Over</HI> (Under) <HI>Value</HI> our Liber|ties, when we have them, &s;o much as &s;ome|times we have done; and this is not one of
<PB N="21" REF="20">
the lea&s;t Advantages which we &s;hall gain by the Coming of the Pretender, and con&s;e|quently one of the good Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould be very willing to receive him.</P>
<P>The next Thing which they fill us with Apprehen&s;ions of in the Coming of the Pretender, is the Influence of <HI>French</HI> Coun|cils, which they Con&s;true thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Pretender being re&s;tor'd here by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>France,</HI> will not only Rule us by <HI>French</HI> Methods, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by <HI>French</HI> Tyranny, but in Gratitude to his Re&s;torer he will cau&s;e us to be always ready with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Blood and Trea&s;ure to A&s;&s;i&s;t and Support the <HI>French</HI> Ambition in the Inva&s;i|ons he will ever be making upon <HI>Europe,</HI> and in the Oppre&s;&s;ions of other Nations; till at la&s;t he obtain the Superiority over them all, and turn upon us too, devouring the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> in his &s;o long pur|po&s;ed and re&s;olved <HI>Univer&s;al Monarchy.</HI> As to the Gratitude of the Pretender to the King of <HI>France,</HI> why &s;hould you make that a Crime? Are not all People bound in Ho|nour to retaliate Kindne&s;s? And would you have your Prince be ungrateful to him that brought him hither? By the &s;ame Rule you would expect he could be ungrateful to us that receive him; be&s;ides, if it be &s;o great an Advantage to us to have him brought in, we &s;hall be all concern'd al&s;o in Gratitude
<PB N="22" REF="21">
to the King of <HI>France</HI> for helping us to him; and &s;ure we &s;hall not decline making a &s;uitable Return to him for the Kindne&s;s; and is this any Thing more than common? Did we not pay the <HI>Dutch</HI> Six Hundred Thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Late King <HI>William?</HI> And did we not imme|diately Embark with them in the War again&s;t the King of <HI>France?</HI> And has not that Revolution co&s;t the Nation One Hundred Millions of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Money to Support it? And &s;hall we grutch to Support the Pre|tender, and his Benefactor, at the &s;ame Expence, if it &s;hould be needful, for carry|ing on the New Scheme of <HI>French</HI> Li|berty, which when that Time comes may be in a likely and forward Way to prevail over the whole World, to the General Hap|pine&s;s of <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P>There &s;eems to be but one Thing more which tho&s;e People, who make &s;uch a Cla|mour at the Fears of the Pretender, take hold of, and this is Religion; and they tell us, that not only <HI>French</HI> Government, and <HI>French</HI> Influence, but <HI>French</HI> Religion, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Popery,</HI> will come upon us; but the&s;e People know not what they talk of, for it is evident that they &s;hall be &s;o far from being loaden with Religion, that they will rather obtain that &s;o long de&s;ired Hap|pine&s;s, of having no Religion at all. This
<PB N="23" REF="22">
we may ea&s;ily make appear has been the Advantage which has been long labour'd for in this Nation; and as the Attainments we are arriv'd to of that Kind are very con&s;iderable already, &s;o we cannot doubt but that if once the Pretender were &s;ettled quietly among us, an Ab&s;olute Subjection, as well of Religious Principles, as Civil Li|berties, to the Di&s;po&s;al of the Sovereign, would take Place. This is an Advantage &s;o fruitful of &s;everal other manife&s;t Improve|ments, that though we have not Room in this Place to enlarge upon the Particulars, we cannot doubt but it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t grate|ful Piece of News to a great Part of the Nation, who have long groan'd under the Oppre&s;&s;ions and cruel Severities of the Clergy, occa&s;ion'd by their own &s;trict Lives, and rigorous Virtue, and their impo&s;ing &s;uch Au&s;terities and Re&s;traints upon the People; and in this Particular the Cla|mour of Slavery will appear very &s;canda|lous in the Nation, for the Slavery of Religion being taken off, and an Univer&s;al Freedom of Vice being introduced, what greater Liberty can we enjoy.</P>
<P>But we have yet greater Advantages at|tending this Nation by the Coming of the Pretender than any we have yet taken No|tice of; and though we have not Room in

this &s;hort Tract to name them all, and en|large upon them as the Ca&s;e may require, yet we cannot omit &s;uch due Notice of them, as may &s;erve to &s;atisfie our Readers, and convince them, how much they ought to favour the Coming of the Pretender, as the great Benefit to the whole Nation; and therefore we &s;hall begin with our Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and here we may tell them, that they, of all the Parts of this I&s;land, &s;hall receive the mo&s;t evident Advantages, in that the &s;etting the Pretender upon the Throne &s;hall effectually &s;et them free from the Bondage they now groan under, in their abhorr'd Subjection to <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Union, which</HI> may, no que&s;tion, be de|clar'd Void, and Di&s;&s;olv'd, as a Violence upon the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation, as &s;oon as ever the Pretender &s;hall be E&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Throne; a few Words may &s;erve to recom|mend this to the <HI>Scots,</HI> &s;ince we are very well &s;atisfied we &s;hall be &s;ure to oblige every Side there, by it: The Oppo&s;ition all Sides made to the Union at the Time of the Tran&s;action of the Union in the Parliament there, cannot but give us Rea&s;on to think thus; and the pre&s;ent Scruple, even the Presbyterians them&s;elves make, of taking the Abjuration, if they do not, as &s;ome pretend, a&s;&s;ure us that the &s;aid Presbyterian Non|jurers are in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender,

yet they undeniably prove, and put it out of all que&s;tion, that they are ill-plea&s;ed with the Yoke of the Union, and would embrace every ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of being qui|etly and freely di&s;charged from the Fetters which they believe they bear by the &s;aid Union; now there is no Doubt to be made, but that upon the very fir&s;t Appear|ance of the Pretender, the Antient King|dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould recover her former well-known Condition, we mean, of being perfectly free, and depending upon none but the King of <HI>France.

&s;o little &s;atisfied with the <HI>&V;nion</HI> at this Time, that if it were now to be put to the Vote, as it was before, whether they &s;hould Unite with <HI>England,</HI> or no, there would not be one Man in Fifteen, through|out <HI>Scotland,</HI> that would Vote for it. <HI>If then</HI> it appears that the whole Nation thus &s;eems to be aver&s;e to the Union, and by the Coming in of this mo&s;t Glorious Pre|tender that Union will be in all Appear|ance di&s;&s;olved, and the Nation freed from the Encumbrance of it, will any <HI>Scots</HI> Man, who is again&s;t the Union, refu&s;e to be for the Pretender?

But we have more and greater Advan|tages of the Coming of the Pretender, and &s;uch as no que&s;tion will invite you to receive him with great Satisfaction and Ap|plau&s;e; and it cannot be unnece&s;&s;ary to inform you, for your Direction in other Ca&s;es, how the Matter, as to Real and Imaginary Advantage, &s;tands with the Na|tion in this Affair; and <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Coming of the Pretender will at once put us all out of Debt. The&s;e Abomination-Whigs, and the&s;e Bloody Wars, carried on &s;o long for little or nothing, <HI>have,</HI> as is evident to our Sen&s;es <HI>now,</HI> (whatever it was all along,) brought a heavy Debt upon the Nation; &s;o that if what a known Author lately Publi&s;hed is true, the Government pays now almo&s;t Six Millions a Year to the Common People for Intere&s;t of Money; that is to &s;ay, the U&s;urers Eat up the Na|tion, and Devour Six Millions Yearly; which is paid, and mu&s;t be paid now for a long Time, if &s;ome <HI>kind Turn,</HI> &s;uch as this of the Coming of the Pretender, or &s;uch like, does not help us out of it; the Weight of this is not only Great, in&s;uperably Great, but mo&s;t of it is entailed for a terrible Time, not only for our Age, but beyond the Age of our Grand-children, even for Ninety-nine Years: By how much the Con|&s;ideration of this Debt is Intolerable and

Afflicting to the la&s;t Degree, by &s;o much the greater mu&s;t the Obligation be to the Per&s;on, who will Ea&s;e the Nation of &s;uch a Burthen, and therefore we place it among the Principal Advantages which we are to receive from the Admi&s;&s;ion of the Preten|der, that he will not fail to rid us of this Grievance, and by Methods peculiar to him&s;elf, deliver us from &s;o great a Burthen as the&s;e Debts are now, and, unle&s;s he de|liver us, are like to be to the Ages to come: Whither he will do this at once, by remitting mo&s;t Graciou&s;ly to the Na|tion the whole Payment, and con&s;equently take off the Burthen, <HI>Brevi Manu,</HI> as with a Spunge wiping out the Infamous Score, leaving it to fall as Fate directs, or by pru|dent Degrees, we know not, nor is it our Bu&s;ine&s;s to determine it here; no Doubt the doing it with a Jerk, as we call it, <HI>Comme une Coup de Grace,</HI> mu&s;t be the mo&s;t expe|ditious Way; nay, and the kinde&s;t Way of putting the Nation out of its Pain; for lingering Deaths are counted cruel; and tho' <HI>&V;ne coup d'Eclat</HI> may make an Impre&s;|&s;ion for the Pre&s;ent, yet the A&s;toni&s;hment is &s;oone&s;t over; be&s;ides, where is the Lo&s;s to the Nation in this Sen&s;e?

But what is this to the Purpo&s;e in a National Revolution; unju&s;t! Alas! Is that an Argument? Go and ask the Pretender! Does not he &s;ay you have all done unju&s;tly by him? And &s;ince the Na|tion in general lo&s;es Nothing, what Obli|gation has he to regard the particular In|jury that &s;ome Families may &s;u&s;tain? And yet farther, is it not remarkable, that mo&s;t Part of the Money is paid by the Cur&s;ed Party of Whigs, who from the Beginning officiou&s;ly appear'd to keep him from his Right? And what Obligation has he upon him to concern him&s;elf for doing them Right in Particular, more than other Peo|ple? But to avoid the Scandal of Partia|lity, there is another Thought offers to our View, which the Nation is beholding to a Particular Author for putting us in Mind of; if it be unju&s;t that we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the Pretender &s;hall &s;top the Pay|ment on both Sides, becau&s;e it is doing the Whigs Wrong, &s;ince the Tories, who per|haps being chiefly Landed Men, pay the mo&s;t Taxes; then, to keep up a ju&s;t Bal|lance, he need only continue the Taxes to be paid in, and only &s;top the Annuities and Intere&s;t which are to be paid out.

Thus both Sides having no Rea&s;on to Envy or Reproach one another with Hard&s;hips, or with &s;uffering Unequally; they may eve|ry one lo&s;e their Proportion, and the Mo|ney may be laid up in the Hands of the New Sovereign, for the Good of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>This being thus happily propo&s;ed, we cannot pa&s;s over the great Advantages which would accrue to this Nation in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, by having &s;uch a Ma&s;s of Money laid up in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> at the Ab&s;olute Command of a mo&s;t Gracious <HI>French</HI> So|vereign.

You are to allow, that by &s;uch a Ju&s;t and Righ|teous &s;hutting up of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> in about Seven Years Time, he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have received about Forty Millions Sterling from his People, which not being to be found in <HI>Specie</HI> in the Kingdom, will, for the Benefit of Circulation, enable him to Trea&s;ure up Infinite Funds of Wealth in Foreign Banks, a prodigious Ma&s;s of Foreign Bullion, Gold, Jewels, and

Plate, to be ready in the <HI>Tower,</HI> or el&s;e|where, to be i&s;&s;ued upon Future Emer|gency, as Occa&s;ion may allow. This pro|digious Wealth will nece&s;&s;arily have the&s;e happy Events, to the Infinite Satisfaction and Advantage of the whole Nation, and the Benefit of which I hope none will be &s;o Unju&s;t, or Ungrateful, to deny. (1.) It will for ever after deliver this Nation from the Burthen, the Expence, the Formality, and the Tyranny, of Parliaments. No one can perhaps at the fir&s;t View be rightly &s;en&s;ible of the many Advantages of this Article, and from how many Mi&s;chiefs it will deliver this Nation. (1.) How the Countrey Gentlemen will be no longer har|ra&s;s'd to come, at the Command of every Court Occa&s;ion, and upon every Summons by the Prince's Proclamation, from their Families, and other Occa&s;ions, whether they can be &s;pared from their Wives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or no, or whether they can tru&s;t their Wives be|hind them, or no; nay, whether they can &s;pare Money or no for the Journey, or whether they mu&s;t come <HI>Carriage Paid</HI> or no; <HI>then</HI> they will no more be unnece&s;&s;a|rily expo&s;ed to Long and Hazardous Jour|neys, in the Depth of Winter, from the remote&s;t Corners of the I&s;land, to come to <HI>London,</HI> ju&s;t to give away the Countrey's Money, and go Home again; all this will

be di&s;penced with by the Kind and Graci|ous Management of the Pretender, when he, <HI>God ble&s;s us,</HI> &s;hall be our more Gra|cious Sovereign. (2.) In the happy Con|&s;equence of the Demi&s;e of Parliaments, the Countrey will be ea&s;ed of that intolerable Burthen of Travelling to Elections, &s;ome|times in the Depth of Winter, &s;ometimes in the Middle of their Harve&s;t, whenever the Writs of Elections Arbitrarily Sum|mons them. (3.) And with them the Poor Gentlemen will be ea&s;ed of that abominable Grievance of the Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Expence of Elections, by which &s;o many Gentlemen of E&s;tates have been Ruin'd, &s;o many innocent People, of ho|ne&s;t Principles before, have been De|bauched, and made Mercenary, Partial, Perjur'd, and been Blinded with Bribes, to Sell their Countrey and Liberties to who bids mo&s;t. It is well known how often, and yet how in vain, this Di&s;tem|per has been the con&s;tant Concern of Par|liaments, for many Ages, to Cure, and to provide &s;ufficient Remedies for. Now if ever the effectual Remedy for this is found out, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Advantage of the whole Nation; and this perhaps is the only Cure for it that the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e will admit of; what terrible Ha|vock has this kind of Trade made among
<PB N="34" REF="33">
the E&s;tates of the Gentry, and the Morals of the Common People? (4.) How al&s;o has it kept alive the Factions and Divi|&s;ions of the Countrey People, keeping them in a Con&s;tant Agitation, and in Tri|ennial Commotions? So that what with Forming New Intere&s;ts, and Cultivating Old, the Heats and Animo&s;ities never cea&s;e among the People. But once &s;et the Pre|tender upon the Throne, and let the Funds be but happily &s;topt, and paid into his Hands, that he may be in no more Need of a Parliament, and all the&s;e Di&s;tempers will be cur'd as effectually as a Feaver is cur'd by cutting off the Head, or as a Hal|ter cures the Bleeding at the No&s;e. How Infatuated then is this Nation, that they &s;hould &s;o ob&s;tinately refu&s;e a Prince, by the Nature of who&s;e Circum&s;tances, and the avowed Principles of who&s;e Party, we are &s;ure to obtain &s;uch Glorious Things, &s;uch Ine&s;timable Advantages, Things which no Age, no Prince, no Attempt of Parties, or Endeavour, though often aim'd at of Mini&s;ters of State, have ever been able to procure for us. (2.) This Ama&s;|&s;ing of Trea&s;ure, by the &s;topping the Funds on one Hand, and the receiving the Taxes on the other, will effectually enable the Pretender to &s;et up, and effectually main|tain, that Glorious, and &s;o often-de&s;ir'd, Me|thod

write upon all your Companies this Gene|ral Phra&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>No Transfer,</HI> as they do when the Books are &s;hut up at the <HI>Bank,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Hou&s;e; &s;o as all the Rivers of Water are &s;wallowed up in the Sea, as One Ocean, to which they are all tending, &s;o all the&s;e petty Cheats will be Ingulph'd at once in the General Ocean of State Trick, and the <HI>Exchange-Alley-Men</HI> may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to Buy the <HI>Bear-Skin</HI> ever after.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Then</HI> (which is a Ble&s;&s;ing we fear we cannot hope for before) we may expect to be deliver'd from the Throng of Virulent and Contumatious Libels which now Infe&s;t our Streets; and the Libellers them&s;elves being mo&s;t exemplarily Puni&s;hed, for a Terror to the re&s;t, will not dare to affront the Government with Ballads and Balder|da&s;h; if an impudent Fellow dares lift up his Pen again&s;t the Authority and Power of his Prince, he &s;hall in&s;tantly feel the Weight of that Power to cru&s;h him, which he ought before to have feared; and Pamphleteers &s;hall then not be Whipped and Pillor'd, but Hang'd; and when Two or Three of them have &s;uffered that Way, it is hoped tho&s;e whole&s;ome Severities may put an effectual &s;top to the Noi&s;e and Clamour they now make in the Nation; above all, the Hands of the Government will then be &s;et free from the Fetters of Law; and it &s;hall

not be always nece&s;&s;ary for the Mini&s;ters of State to proceed by all the Forms of the Courts of Ju&s;tice, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, by which the Scriblers of the Age pretend to &s;tand it out again&s;t the Government, and put their own Con&s;truction upon their Libels. But when the&s;e happy Days arrive, Juries and Judges &s;hall find and determine in the&s;e, and all other Ca&s;es, bring Verdicts, and give Sentence, as the Prince in his Royal Ju&s;tice &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>We might enter here upon a long Li&s;t of other happy Circum&s;tances we &s;hall all ar|rive to, and of great Advantages not here named, which the Coming in of the Preten|der &s;hall infallibly bring us to the Enjoy|ment of, particularly in Matters of Religion, Civil Right, Property and Commerce, but the needful Brevity of this Tract will not admit of it; we &s;hall only add one Thing more, which gives Weight to all the re&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Certainty of the&s;e Things, and of their being the Natural Con&s;equen|ces of the bringing in the Pretender, adds to the certain Felicity of that Reign. This Sums up the Happine&s;s of the Pretender's Reign; we need not talk of Security, as the <HI>Review</HI> has done, and pretend he is not able to give us Security for the Performance of any Thing he promi&s;es; every Man that has any Sen&s;e of the Principles, Honour,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
and Ju&s;tice of the Pretender, his Zeal for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Cau&s;e, his Gratitude to his Benefactor, the <HI>French</HI> King, and his Love to the Glory and Happine&s;s of his Native Countrey, mu&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfied of his punctually performing all the&s;e Great Things for us; to ask him Security, would be not to Af|front him only, but to Affront the whole Nation; <HI>No Man can doubt him</HI>; the Nature of the Thing allows that he mu&s;t do us all that Kindne&s;s; he cannot be true to his own Rea&s;on without it; wherefore this Treaty <HI>executes it&s;elf,</HI> and appears &s;o rational to believe, that whoever doubts it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to doubt even the Veracity of <HI>James</HI> the Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>What unaccountable Folly then mu&s;t tho&s;e People be Guilty of, who &s;tand &s;o much in the Way of their own and their Countrey's Happine&s;s, as to oppo&s;e, or pretend to argue again&s;t, the receiving this Glorious Prince, and would be for having <HI>Dutch</HI> Men and Foreigners for&s;ooth to come, and all under the Notion of their being <HI>PROTE|STANTS?</HI> To avoid and detect which Fallacy, we &s;hall in our next E&s;&s;ay enter into the Examina|tion of the Religion and Orthodox Principles of the Per&s;on of the Pretender, and doubt not to make it out, for the Satisfaction of all Tender Con&s;ciences, that he is a true Prote&s;tant of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law, and that in very Natural Primitive Sen&s;e of that Phra&s;e as it was u&s;ed by His Royal Predece&s;&s;or, of Famous and Pious Memory, <HI>Charles</HI> II.&mdash;and as &s;uch, no doubt, he will endeavour for the Recovery of the Crown, which Crown, if he obtains it, you &s;ee what Glori|ous Things he may do for him&s;elf, and us.</P>
