<HEAD>THE
ANATOMY
OF
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE General Cry again&s;t
Stock-Jobbing has been
&s;uch, and People have
been &s;o long, and &s;o ju&s;tly
Complaining of it as a
publick Nu&s;ance; and
which is &s;till wor&s;e, have complained &s;o long
without a Remedy, that the Jobbers, harden'd
in Crime, are at la&s;t come to exceed all
<PB N="2" REF="3">
bounds, and now, if ever, &s;leeping Ju&s;tice
will awake, and take &s;ome Notice of them,
and if it &s;hould not now, yet the diligem
Creatures are &s;o &s;teddy to them&s;elves, that
they will &s;ome time or other, make it ab&s;olute|ly
nece&s;&s;ary to the Government to demoli&s;h
them.</P>
<P>I know they upon all Occa&s;ions laugh at the
Sugge&s;tion, and have the Pride to think it im|practicable
to re&s;train them; and one of the
top of the Function the other Day, when I
ca&s;ually told him, That if they went on, they
wou'd make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Le|gi&s;lature,
to &s;uppre&s;s them, return'd, That he
believ'd it was as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for 'em
to do it now, as ever it could be; But how will
they do it? 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, but if the
Government takes Credit, their Funds &s;hould
come to Market; and while there is a Market
we will buy and &s;ell; there is no effectual way
in the World, &s;ays he, to &s;uppre&s;s us but this,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Government &s;hould fir&s;t pay
all the publick Debts, redeem all the Funds,
and di&s;&s;olve all the Charters, <HI>viz. Bank, South-Sea,</HI>
and <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> and buy nothing upon
Tru&s;t, and then, indeed, &s;ays he, they need
not hang the Stock-Jobbers, for they will be
apt to hang them &s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I in part agree that this is
an effectual way, but I am far from thinking
it the only way to deal with a Confederati|on
of U&s;urers, who having &s;old the whole
Nation to U&s;ury, keep the Pur&s;e-Strings of
Poor and Rich in their Hands, which they
open and &s;hut as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But before I come to the needful ways for
re&s;training tho&s;e People, I think 'twill be of
&s;ome Service to expo&s;e their Practices to
common view, that the People may &s;ee a
little what kind of Dealers they are.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, they have this peculiar to 'em, and
in which they out-do all the particular pieces
of publick Knavery that ever I met with in the
World, <HI>viz.</HI> That they have nothing to &s;ay for
it them&s;elves; they have, indeed a particular
Stock of hard Ware, as the Braziers call it, in
their Faces, to bear them out in it; but if you
talk to them of their Occupation, there is not
a Man but will own, 'tis a compleat Sy&s;tem of
Knavery; that 'tis a Trade founded in Fraud,
born of Deceit, and nouri&s;hed by Trick, Cheat,
Wheedle, Forgeries, Fal&s;hoods, and all &s;orts
of Delu&s;ions; Coining fal&s;e News, this way
good, that way bad; whi&s;pering imaginary
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Terrors, Frights, Hopes, Expectations, and
then preying upon the Weakne&s;s of tho&s;e,
who&s;e Imaginations they have wrought upon,
whom they have either elevated or depre&s;s'd.
If they meet with a Cull, a young Dealer
that has Money to lay out, they catch him at
the Door, whi&s;per to him, Sir, here is a great
piece of News, it is not yet publick, it is worth
a Thou&s;and Guineas but to mention it: I am
heartily glad I met you, but it mu&s;t be as &s;e|cret
as the black &s;ide of your Soul, for they
know nothing of it yet in the Coffee-Hou&s;e,
if they &s;hould, Stock would ri&s;e 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> in
a moment, and I warrant you <HI>South-Sea</HI> will
be 130 in a Week's Time, after it is known.
Well, &s;ays the weak Creature, prethee dear
<HI>Tom</HI> what is it? Why really Sir I will <HI>let you
into the Secret,</HI> upon your Honour to keep it till
you hear it from other Hands; why 'tis this,
<HI>The Pretender is certainly taken</HI> and is carried
Pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Millan,</HI> there they have
him fa&s;t; I a&s;&s;ure you, the Government had an
Expre&s;s of it from my Lord <HI>St----s</HI> within this
Hour. Are you &s;ure of it, &s;ays the Fi&s;h, who
jumps eagerly into the Net? Sure of it! why if
you will take your Coach and go up to the Secre|taries-Office,
you may be &s;atisfied of it your
&s;elf, and be down again in Two Hours, and in
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the mean time I will be doing &s;omething, tho'
it is but little, till you return.</P>
<P>Away goes the Gudgeon with his Head full
of Wildfire, and a Squib in his Brain, and co|ming
to the Place, meets a Croney at the Door,
who ignorantly confirms the Report, and &s;o
&s;ets fire to the Mine; for indeed the Cheat
came too far to be baulkt at home: So that
without giving him&s;elf Time to con&s;ider, he
hurries back full of the Delu&s;ions, dreaming of
nothing but of getting a Hundred Thou&s;and
Pounds, or purcha&s;e Two; and even this Mo|ney
was to be gotten only upon the Views of
his being before-hand with other People.</P>
<P>In this Elevation, he meets his Broker, who
throws more Fire-works into the Mine, and
blows him up to &s;o fierce an Inflamation, that
he employs him in&s;tantly to take Guineas to
accept Stock of any Kind, and almo&s;t at any
Price; for the News being now publick, the
Arti&s;t made their Price upon him. In a
Word, having accepted them for Fifty Thou|&s;and
Pounds more than he is able to pay,
the Jobber has got an E&s;tate, the Broker 2 or
300 Guineas, and the E&s;quire remains at Lei|&s;ure
to &s;ell his Coach and Hor&s;es, his fine Seat
and rich Furniture, to make good the Defici|ency
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of his Bear-Skins, and at la&s;t, when all
will not go through it, he mu&s;t give them a
Bru&s;h for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There are who tell us, that the <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Improvements made upon the News of
the Pretender's being taken, were part of the
Plot, that the late Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having concerted
the Voyage of <HI>Voghera,</HI> and how and in what
Manner the Report of the Pretender's being
there &s;hould &s;pread, who it &s;hould amu&s;e, and
how at one Blow it &s;hould &s;pread Ea&s;t to <HI>Vi|enna,</HI>
and North-We&s;t to <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;o on; for|got
not to contrive it, as at once &s;hould &s;erve
Political Ends in <HI>Italy</HI> and at <HI>Vienna:</HI> So on
the other hand, it &s;hould not fail to &s;erve a
private View in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> and at the
&s;ame time that he deceiv'd &s;ome of the Whiggs
who he ow'd a large Grudge to for &s;hrew'd
Turns at <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Dumblain,</HI> he might al&s;o
rai&s;e a Tax upon them towards the incident
Charges of his wandring Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I do not averr this Story to be true, but the
Concert is &s;o exact, and the Nature of it &s;o
agreeable to the Stock-jobbing Art, nay and
to the Arti&s;ts al&s;o, who&s;e Corre&s;pondents are
very punctual, e&s;pecially &s;ince it is &s;aid, that
Mr. T&mdash;s chief Agent was formerly my
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Lord <HI>M&mdash;r</HI>'s Broker; that I wont affirm it
may be true; but this I will venture to &s;ay of
it, That if we are often &s;erv'd thus, the Pre|tender
may very ea&s;ily rai&s;e a Hundred Thou|&s;and
Pounds a Year in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> for the
carrying on an Inva&s;ion, and lay the Tax
wholly upon his Enemies the Whigs, which,
by the way, I leave them to con&s;ider of.</P>
<P>But now that I may make good the Charge
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the whole Art and My&s;tery is a
meer Original Sy&s;tem of Cheat and Delu&s;ion;
I mu&s;t let you &s;ee too, that this Part of the
Comedy may be very well call'd, <HI>A Bite for
the Biter;</HI> for which I mu&s;t go back to the
Broker and his Gudgeon. The Money'd Gen|tleman
finding him&s;elf let into the Secret in|deed
, and that he was bitten to the Tune of
30000 l. wor&s;e than nothing. After he had
unhappily paid as far as his ready Money
wou'd go, of which Piece of Hone&s;ty they &s;ay
he has heartily repented, <HI>and is in Hopes all that
come after him will forgive him for the &s;ake of what
follow'd,</HI> &s;topt &s;hort, as he might well, you'll
&s;ay, when his Money was all gone, and be|thinks
him&s;elf, What am la doing! I have paid
away all this Money like a Fool, I was
drawn in like an A&s;s, by the eager De&s;ire of
Biting my Neighbours to a va&s;t Sum, and I
<PB N="8" REF="9">
have been Fool enough in that, but I have been
ten Thou&s;and times a wor&s;e Fool, to pay a Groat
of the Money, e&s;pecially &s;ince I knew I could
not pay it all: Be&s;ides, who but I would have
forgot the Nature of the Thing I was dealing
in, and of the People I was dealing with;
why, is it not all a meer Body of Knavery?
Is not the whole Doctrine of Stock-Jobbing a
Science of Fraud? And are not all the Dealers,
meer Original Thieves and Pick-Pockets? Nay,
do they not own it them&s;elves? Have not I
heard <HI>T. W. B. O.</HI> and <HI>J. S.</HI> a thou&s;and times
&s;ay they know their Employment was a Branch
of Highway Robbing, and only differ'd in
two things, <HI>Fir&s;t in Degree,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it was
ten Thou&s;and times wor&s;e, more remor&s;ele&s;s,
more void of Humanity, done without Nece&s;|&s;ity,
and committed upon Fathers, Brothers,
Widows, Orphans, and intimate Friends;
in all which Ca&s;es, Highwaymen, generally
touch'd with Remor&s;e, and affected with Prin|ciples
of Humanity and Genero&s;ity, &s;topt &s;hort
and choo&s;e to prey upon Strangers only. <HI>Se|condly
in Danger,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the&s;e rob &s;ecure|ly
; the other, with the utmo&s;t Ri&s;que that
the Highwaymen run, at the Hazard of their
Lives, being &s;ure to be hang'd fir&s;t or la&s;t,
whereas the&s;e rob only at the Hazard of their
Reputation which is generally lo&s;t before they
<PB N="9" REF="10">
begin, and of their Souls, which Trifle is not
worth the mentioning. Have not I, I &s;ay,
heard my Broker Mr. ........ &s;ay all this,
and much more? And have not I al&s;o heard
him &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">'That no Man was obliged to make
good any of their <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> Bargains,
unle&s;s he plea&s;ed, and unle&s;s he was in ha&s;te
to part with his Money, which indeed I am
not: And has not all the Brokers and Job|bers, when they have been bitten too hard,
&s;aid the &s;ame thing, and refu&s;ed to pay'?<P>'Pray, how much did Old <HI>Cudworth, Ph.
C....p....m,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Goo......g</HI> Emi|nent
Jobbers, Monarchs in their Days of <HI>Ex|change-Alley,</HI>
break for? And how much did
they ever pay? One, if I mi&s;take not, com|pounded
at la&s;t for one Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound,
and the other Two for &s;omething le&s;s'.</P>
<P>'In a Word, they are all a Gang of Rogues
and Cheats, and I'll pay none of them: Be|&s;ides,
my Lawyer, Sir <HI>Thomas Subtle,</HI> tells
me, there's not a Man of them dares &s;ue
me; <HI>No, tho' I had no Protection to fly to,</HI> and
he &s;tates the Ca&s;e thus:'</P>
<P>'You have Sir (<HI>&s;ays Subtle</HI>) contracted to
accept of Stock at a high Price; <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> at
<PB N="10" REF="11">
220, <HI>Bank</HI> at 160, <HI>South-Sea</HI> 120, and the
like. <HI>Very well,</HI> they come to put it upon
you, the Stock being &s;ince fallen; tell them
you cannot take it yet: If they urge your
Contract, and demand when you will take
it, <HI>tell them,</HI> you will take it when you
think fit.'</P>
<P>'If they &s;wagger, call Names, as Rogue,
Cheat, <HI>and the like,</HI> tell them, <HI>as to that,</HI>
you are all of a Fraternity; there is no
great Matter in it, whether you Cheat them,
or they Cheat you; 'tis as it happens in the
Way of Trade, that it all belongs to the
Craft; and as the Devil's Broker, <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI>
&s;aid to Par&s;on <HI>Giffard,</HI> tell them you are all
of a Trade: If they Rage, and tell you the
Devil will have you, and &s;uch as that; <HI>tell
them,</HI> they &s;hould let the Devil and you a|lone
to agree about that, 'tis none of their
Bu&s;ine&s;s: But when he comes for you, tell
them you would advi&s;e them to <HI>keep out of
the Way,</HI> or <HI>get a Protection,</HI> as you have
again&s;t them.'</P>
<P>'After this, it is &s;uppo&s;ed they will &s;ue you
at Law, then leave it to me, I'll hang them
up for a Year or Two in our Courts; and if
ever in that time the Stock comes up to the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Price, we will tender the Money in Court,
demand the Stock, and Saddle the Charges
of the Suit upon them; let them avoid it
if they can.'</P>
<P>'This is my Lawyer's Opinion, <HI>&s;ays he to
him&s;elf,</HI> and I'll follow it to a Tittle, and &s;o
we are told he has, and I do not hear that
one Stock-Jobber has begun to &s;ue him yet,
or intends it, nor indeed dare they do it.'</P></Q></P>
<P>This Experiment indeed may teach Under|&s;tanding
to every hone&s;t Man that falls into
the Clutches of the&s;e mercile&s;s Men, call'd
Stock-Jobbers; and I give the World this No|tice
, that in &s;hort, not one of their <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Bargains, need be otherwi&s;e than thus
complied with; and let the&s;e <HI>Buyers of Bear|skins</HI>
remember it; not a Man of them dare
go to Common-Law to recover the Conditions;
nor is any Man oblig'd, further then he thinks
him&s;elf oblig'd in Principle, to make good
one of his Bargains with them; how far Prin|ciple
will carry any Man to be ju&s;t to a com|mon
Cheat, that has drawn him into a
Snare, I do not indeed know; but I cannot
&s;uppo&s;e 'twill go a very great Length, where
there is &s;o clear, &s;o plain, and &s;o legal a Door
to get out at.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that if the projected
Story of the taking the Pretender was acted in
Concert between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
between my Lord <HI>Marr,</HI> and a certain Broker
as Fame reports, either the Broker is the De|vil
of a Jacobite, or my Lord the Devil of a
Broker; it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd 'twas a far
fetch'd Trick, and an&s;wer'd the End in Ex|change
mo&s;t admirably.</P>
<P>Nor can all the World tell us any other End
that it could an&s;wer, for as to the Pretences of
deluding the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> on Shore, or the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Men of War at Sea, and &s;o the better
to facilitate the E&s;cape of the Pretender to
<HI>Spain,</HI> I undertake to prove, that this is ab|&s;urd
and ridiculous, for the Pretender was
Embark'd at <HI>Netunna,</HI> and gone away to Sea
thirteen Days at lea&s;t, before this Whim of
People taken at <HI>Voghera</HI> was talk'd of.</P>
<P>As to the Amu&s;ements among the Courtsa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>Vienna, Paris</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> they amounted to
nothing at all, an&s;wer'd no End, neither
prompted any De&s;ign on one hand, or hindred
any Thing on the other: In a Word, we may
challenge the World, to tell us any one Turn
that was &s;erv'd by it, or End an&s;wer'd by it&punc;
but this in <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
Nor was this &s;o incon&s;iderable a De&s;ign, as
not to be worth while to form &s;uch a Juggle,
tho' a great way off; and as far off as it is, if
we may believe the Report of tho&s;e who re|member
the Machines and Contrivances of
that Original of Stock-Jobbing, Sir <HI>J--- C----</HI> There
are tho&s;e who tell us, Letters have been
order'd, by private Management, to be writ|ten
from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> with an Account of
the Lo&s;s of Ships which have been arriv'd
there, and the Arrival of Ships lo&s;t; of War
which the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> when they have been
in perfect Tranquility, and of Peace with
the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> when he was come down
again&s;t the Factory of <HI>Bengale</HI> with One Hun|dred
Thou&s;and Men, ju&s;t as it was, thought
proper to calculate tho&s;e Rumours for the
Rai&s;ing and Falling of the Stock, and when
it was for his Purpo&s;e to but cheap, or &s;ell
dear.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to give an Account of
the Subtiltics of that Capital Che....t, when
he had a De&s;ign to Bite the whole <HI>Exchange:</HI>
As he was the leading Hand to the Market, &s;o
he kept it in his Power to &s;et the Price to all
the Dealers. The Subject then was clrie fly the
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Stock, tho' there were other Stocks
<PB N="14" REF="15">
on foot too, tho' &s;ince &s;unk to nothing; &s;uch as
the <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s-Bay Company, the Linnen Ma|nufacture
Stock, Paper Stock, Salt-Petre Stock
and others, all at this Day wor&s;e than nothing,
tho' &s;ome of them then Jobb'd up to 350 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> as the two fir&s;t in particular.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Stock was the main Point,
every Man's Eye, when he came to Market,
was upon the Broker's, who acted for Sir <HI>J&mdash;</HI> Does
Sir <HI>J&mdash;</HI> Sell or Buy? If Sir <HI>J&mdash;</HI> had a
Mind to buy, the fir&s;t thing he did was to
Commi&s;&s;ion his Brokers to look &s;ower, &s;hake
their Heads, &s;ugge&s;t bad News from <HI>India;</HI>
and at the Bottom it follow'd, I have Com|mi&s;&s;ion
from Sir <HI>J&mdash;</HI> to &s;ell out whatever I
can, and perhaps they would actually &s;ell Ten,
perhaps Twenty Thou&s;and Pound; immediate|ly
the <HI>Exchange</HI> (for they were not then come
to the <HI>Alley</HI>) was full of Sellers; no Body
would buy a Shilling, till perhaps the Stock
would fall Six, Seven, Eight, Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI>
&s;ometimes more; then the Cunning Jobber had
another Sett of Men employ'd on purpo&s;e to
buy, but with Privacy and Caution, all the
Stock they could lay their Hands on, 'till by
&s;elling Ten Thou&s;and Pound, at 4 or 5 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> lo&s;t, he would buy a Hundred Thou&s;and
Pound Stock, at 10 or 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> under Price;
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and in a few Weeks by ju&s;t the contrary Me|thod
, &s;et them all a buying, and then &s;ell
them their own Stock again at ten or twelve
<HI>per Cent.</HI> Profit.</P>
<P>The&s;e hone&s;t Methods laid the Foundation,
we will not &s;ay of a fine great Stone Hou&s;e,
on a certain Forre&s;t, but it certainly laid the
Foundation of an Opulent Family, and iniu|tiated
the Crowd of Jobbers on that dexterity
in tricking and cheating one another, which
to this Day they are the greate&s;t Proficients,
that this part of the World ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>To come a little nearer home, We had ano|ther
Gentleman, who, from a &s;mall Beginning,
came to leave, <HI>as they &s;ay who &s;peak of the lea&s;t,</HI>
250000<HI>l.</HI> behind him, and yet did not die an
old Man neither. This Knight, to avoid as
much as po&s;&s;ible, Reflections upon the A&s;hes
of the Dead, added to the former Craft, that of
bringing &s;udden News into <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> cal|culated
to the Wagers he had to lay, or to any
he had to hedge off, and by this gain'd immen&s;e
Sums of Money (where he living I &s;hould give it
an harder Name.) Why &s;hould it be thought &s;o
&s;trange, that my Lord <HI>Marr</HI> and his Broker
&s;hould trump up a Story from <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;end a
Sett of Po&s;t-Chai&s;es with Gentlemen in Di&s;|gui&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
out of the way of all Road, to be taken
up in the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> and &s;ent to the Ca&s;tle, and
then &s;ent word to a Great Man in <HI>England,</HI>
who is a BELIEVER, that it was the Preten|der
, and all this to rai&s;e the Price of Stocks,
and put it upon the Whiggs. I &s;ay, Why
&s;hould this be more &s;trange than that Sir <HI>H&mdash; F&mdash;&s;e,</HI>
in the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, was
able to maintain &s;uch a con&s;tant Intelligence
in <HI>Holland, Flanders, Germany, Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.
that he &s;everal times brought the King Ac|counts
of Battles fought, Victories won, Towns
taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the &s;wifte&s;t Expre&s;&s;es of
the King's own Servants and Generals could ar|rive
; and had once a Diamond Ring of 500<HI>l.</HI>
given him by the King for his early News.</P>
<P>By this exactly concerted Intelligence, he
then knew how to turn the Wagers (a &s;ort of
Jobbing then in Mode, and which grew &s;o in|famous
that they were at length oblig'd to &s;up|pre&s;s
it by Act of Parliament) which way he
plea&s;ed; and by which he got an immen&s;e Sum
of Money. How often did the Gentleman run
down true News as if it had been fal&s;e, and
run up fal&s;e News as if it had been true, by the
Force of his Foreign Intelligeneers, how often
coin Reports of great Actions to &s;erve a Turn;
it is too late a Trick to be forgot, by many
that were hit by it to the Bone.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
In a word, they putting fal&s;e News upon us
is nothing but an old Trade reviv'd, tho' it
mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, this of the Pretender has
been a Ma&s;ter-Piece, and the worthy Projector
who has the Credit of it, mu&s;t pa&s;s for a dex|trous
Manager as any the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Ex|change-Alley,</HI>
has bred up for 30 Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It had al&s;o one Particular in it, for which
it was very remarkable; Sham Reports, Fal&s;e
News, Foreign Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are Things that
have been often trumpt upon us, as above, and
the Town have been not long ago cheated to a
good round Sum that Way: But then they have
been &s;oon detected, the Morning News has
been &s;et to rights in the Afternoon, or the
Evening's Heat has cool'd by Morning: But
this Trick had a fatal Duration, for it held us
near a Fortnight in a firm Per&s;wa&s;ion of the
Thing; and even then it continued, but &s;u&s;|pected
only for &s;ome time longer, and was
yet longer before it was fully detected, and
even at la&s;t it was hardly conquered till the
Jacobites laugh us out of it, and the Pretender
was look'd for nearer Home.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;urance with which it was carry'd
about, the &s;everal Places from whence it was
<PB N="18" REF="19">
written, made it &s;o effectually be &s;wallow'd
down, that really People &s;aw no room to que|&s;tion
the Truth of it for a great while. 'Twas
written from <HI>Rome,</HI> from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> from <HI>Ge|noa,</HI>
from <HI>Turin,</HI> and from <HI>Paris:</HI> Nay, 'twas
even believ'd at Court, and almo&s;t every
where el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Exqui&s;ite Fraud!</HI> who could have believed
this had been born in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> &s;ent
over to <HI>Rome,</HI> agreed to there and executed
in &s;uch a Manner as to cheat not the Town
only, but all Europe.</P>
<P>The Authority that every one found at|temded
the Report, &s;upported it &s;o that it po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
us all, even tho&s;e who&s;e Concern for the
Fact extorted Tears from them were not un|deceiv
'd. Thus the Huck&s;ters had Time to
play their Game, and they made Hay while
the Sun &s;hone; for if we may believe Com|mon
Fame, Bargains, Contracts and Agree|ments
for Stocks, Bear-Skins included, a|mounted
in that time to &s;ome Hundred Thou|&s;ands
of Pounds, nay, &s;ome &s;ay to Two Mil|lions
and better, mo&s;t of which was to the
Lo&s;s of the <HI>Believing</HI> Party.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
But what Tricking, what Fraud, what lay|ing
Plots as deep as Hell, and as far as the
ends of the Earth is here? What Cheating of
Fathers, and Mothers, and Brothers, gulling
Widows, Orphans, couzening the mo&s;t Wary,
and plundering the Unwary? And how much
meaner Roberies than the&s;e bring the Friend|le&s;s
even to the Gallows every Se&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not &s;top here, the Story of the
Pretender is over, that Trump is play'd, and
the artful Game&s;ter's wanting a new Trick,
after having play'd &s;o many already, that
one would think Invention was at an end,
yet they have found it out, and we are ju&s;t
led into the Secret.</P>
<P>Hitherto Craft and Knavery appears to be
their Method, but we &s;hall trace them now
a little further, and like true Ha&s;&s;ars that
plunder not the Enemy only, but their own
Army, as the Opportunity pre&s;ents; &s;o the&s;e
Men are now come to prey upon the Govern|ment
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Let us look into the late Lotteries, had not
a piercing Eye detected the Rognery, and not
the fall of other things taken off the Edge of the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Peoples Fancy for venturing, the&s;e Arti&s;ts
had brought up the Tickets to 16<HI>s.</HI> a-piece ad|vance
, even before the Act was pa&s;s'd. That
this could not be but by &s;ecuring the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
of all the Tickets in their own hands, ex|cept
&s;uch &s;elect Tickets as were not to come to
<HI>Market.</HI> I <HI>&s;ay,</HI> that this could not be but by
Connivance, and this every one knows; and
that this Connivance again could not be but
by &s;ome higher People than tho&s;e that were
nam'd to it; this al&s;o every one may know,
who they were is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to en|quire
, tho' 'tis ea&s;y to gue&s;s. 'Tis very hard
when our State&s;men come into a Confederacy
to bite the People, and when Dukes turn Stock-Jobbers
: Yet that this was done is mo&s;t cer|tain
, and what was this but making a Proper|ty
of the Power that might be in their Hands,
the better to bite the People: For if the Par|liament
appointed 500,000<HI>l.</HI> in Tickets to be
given out at a certain Rate that was low and
rea&s;onable, was it not to encourage the People
on whom the re&s;t of the National Burthen lies?
And if by the Craft and Knavery of Jobbers
the People are made to pay 600,000<HI>l.</HI> for
them, <HI>which is much about the Ca&s;e,</HI> pray why
not pay the Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds to the
Publick, either to pay off a Hundred Thou|&s;and
Pounds of Debt, or to make the Burthen
<PB N="21" REF="22">
of the current Year a Hundred Thou&s;and
Pounds lighter, of which I am &s;ure there is
need enough.</P>
<P>It has been indeed our Happine&s;s, that a
worthy Member being inform'd of this abo|minable
Cheat, detected it, and laid it before
the Hou&s;e; upon which a Vote was pa&s;t to
make void all Bargains made for Tickets be|fore
the Act was pa&s;t; &s;o the Biters were Bit|ten; and a certain Sir <HI>George -----</HI> was oblig'd
to refund; but the Roguery of the De&s;ign
was never a Jot the le&s;s for that.</P>
<P>But the fatal Influences of this growing
Evil does not end here, and I mu&s;t trace
Stock-jobbing now to its new acquir'd Capaci|ty
of intermeddling with the Publick, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing
Rebellion, encouraging Inva&s;ion; and if
I do not bring the Stock-jobbers, even the
Whigs among them, to be guilty of Trea&s;on
again&s;t their King and Country, and that of
the wor&s;t Kind too, then I do nothing.</P>
<P>Had the Stock-jobbers been all Jacobites by
Profe&s;&s;ion, or had the Employment led them,
by the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Bu&s;ine&s;s to put King
and Nation, and particularly their own, to Bar|gain
and Sale; and had the &s;elling of News
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">een their Property, and they had an Act of
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Parliament, or Patent, to entitle them to the
&s;ole Privilege of impo&s;ing what fal&s;e Things
they plea&s;ed on the People, I &s;hould have had
much the le&s;s Rea&s;on to have complain'd of
their Roguery, and have rather turn'd my
&s;elf to the re&s;t of them People, who are the
Subject they work upon, and only have &s;tood
at <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> End, and cried out, <HI>Gentle|men
, have a care of your Pockets.</HI></P>
<P>Again, had it been a private Club, or Su|ciety
of Men, acting one among another, had
the Cheats, the Frauds, and the Tricks they
daily make u&s;e of, <HI>in which the Engli&s;h Rogue
was a Fool to them,</HI> been practis'd upon them|&s;elves
only; and like Game&s;ters at a publick
Board, they had only play'd with tho&s;e that
came there to play with them; in this Ca&s;e
al&s;o I &s;hould have held my Tongue, and only
put them in mind of an old Song; every
<HI>Stanza</HI> of which chim'd in with <HI>Tantararand,</HI>
Rogues all, Rogues all.</P>
<P>But when we find this Trade become a Po|litical
Vice, a publick Crime, and that as it is
now carried on, it appears dangerous to the
Publick, that whenever any Wickedne&s;s is it
Hand, any Mi&s;chief by the wor&s;t of the Na|tions
Enemies upon the Wheel, the Stock
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Jobbers are naturally made a&s;&s;i&s;tant to it, that
they become Abettors of Trea&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;tant to
Rebellion and Inva&s;ion, then it is certainly
time to &s;peak, for the very Employment be|comes
a Crime, and we are oblig'd to expo&s;e
a Sort of Men, who are more dangerous than
a whole Nation of Enemies Abroad, an Evil
more formidable then the Pe&s;tilence, and in
their Practi&s;e more fatal to the Publick than
an Inva&s;ion of <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome, that the principal Lea|ders
in the Jobbing Trade at that Time, and
at whom mo&s;t part of the Satyr in this Work
ought to be pointed, are Whigs, Members of
Parliament, and Friends to the Government;
and that the refore I had be&s;t have a Care of
what I &s;ay of them.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t An&s;wer is, <HI>So I will.</HI> I will have
a Care of them, and in the next Place let them
have a Care of me; for if I &s;hould &s;peak the
whole Truth of &s;ome of them, they might be
Whigs; but I dare &s;ay, they would be neither
P.......men, or Friends to the Government
very long, and it is very hard his Maje&s;ty

him &s;uch Men are.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Be&s;ides, I deny the Fact; the&s;e Men Friends
to the Government! <HI>Je&s;u Maria!</HI> The Govern|ment
may be friendly to them in a manner
they do not de&s;erve; but as to their being
Friends to the Government, that is no more
po&s;&s;ible than the Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> or the
<HI>Chevalier de St. George</HI> are Friends to the Go|vernment; and therefore without reflecting
upon Per&s;ons, naming Names, or the like;
<HI>there will be no need of Names, the Dre&s;s will de|&s;cribe
them,</HI> I lay down this new fa&s;hion'd Pro|po&s;ition,
or <HI>Po&s;tulatum,</HI> take it which way you
plea&s;e, that I will make it out by the Con|&s;equences
of what I am going to &s;ay.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Stock-jobbing, as it is now practi|&s;ed,
and as is generally under&s;tood by the
Word Stock-jobbing, is neither le&s;s or more
than High-Trea&s;on in its very Nature, and
in its Con&s;equences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Stock-jobbers, who are guilty
of the Practices I am going to detect, are even|tually
Traytors to King <HI>George,</HI> and to his
Government, Family and Intere&s;t, and to
their Country, and de&s;erve to be u&s;ed at lea&s;t
as Confederates with Traytors, when ever
there are any alarms of Inva&s;ions, Rebellions,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
or any &s;ecret Practices again&s;t the Govern|ment
, of what Kind &s;oever.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is a black Charge, and boldly laid, and
ought therefore to be effectually made out,
which &s;hall be the Work of a few Pages in
the following Sheets.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I lay down this as a Rule, which I
appeal to the Laws of Rea&s;on to &s;upport, that
all tho&s;e People, who at a Time of publick
Danger, whether of trea&s;onable Inva&s;ion from
Abroad, or trayterous Attempts to rai&s;e In|&s;urrections
at Home, &s;hall willingly and
wittingly abett, a&s;&s;i&s;t, or encourage the
Traytors, Invading or Rebelling, are equally
guilty of Trea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All tho&s;e who &s;hall endeavour to
weaken, di&s;appoint and di&s;able the Govern|ment
in their Preparations, or di&s;courage the
People in their a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Government to
oppo&s;e the Rebels or Invadors, are guilty of
Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>All that can be alledg'd in Contradiction to
this, and perhaps that could not be made our
neither, is, That they are not Traytors within
the Letter of the Law; to which I an&s;wer
<PB N="26" REF="27">
if they were, I &s;hould not Satyrize them, but
Impeach them. But if it appears that they
are as effectually de&s;tructive to the Peace and
Safety of the Government, and of the King's
Per&s;on and Family, as if they were in open
War with his Power, I do the &s;ame Thing,
and fully an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As there are many Thieves be&s;ides Hou&s;e-Breakers
, Highway-Men, Lifters and Pick|pockets
, &s;o there are many Traytors, be&s;ides
Rebels and Invaders, and perhaps of a much
wor&s;e Kind; for as in a Di&s;pute between a
certain Lord, and a Woman of Plea&s;ure in
the Town, about the different Virtue of the
Sexes, the Lady in&s;i&s;ted that the Men were
Agre&s;&s;ors in the Vice, and that in plain <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI>
if there were no Whore-Ma&s;ters, there
would be no Whores: So, in a Word, if there
were no Parties at Home, no Di&s;affection, no
Traytors among our &s;elves, there would be
no Inva&s;ions from Abroad.</P>
<P>Now I will &s;uppo&s;e for the Purpo&s;e only,
that the People I am &s;peaking of were not di&s;|affected
to the Government; I mean, not origi|nally
, and intentionally pointing their De&s;ign at
the Government; nay, that they are hearty
Whigs, call them as we plea&s;e; yet if it ap|pear
<PB N="27" REF="28">
they are hearty Knaves too, will do any
thing for Money, and are, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of
their Bu&s;ine&s;s oblig'd, or by the vehement
Pur&s;uit of their Intere&s;t, that is to &s;ay, of
their Profits, pu&s;h'd upon Things as effectu|ally
ruinous and de&s;tructive to the Govern|ment
, as the very buying Arms and Amuni|tion
by a profe&s;t Jacobite, in order to Rebel|lion
could be, are they not Traytors even in
&s;pite of Principle, in &s;pite of the Name of
Whig; nay, in &s;pite of a thou&s;and meritori|ous
things that might otherwi&s;e be &s;aid of
them, or done by them?</P>
<P>A Gun-Smith makes ten Thou&s;and Firelocks
in the <HI>Minories,</HI> the hone&s;t Man may be a
Whig, he de&s;igns to &s;ell them to the Govern|ment
to lay up in the <HI>Tower,</HI> or to kill <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
or any of the re&s;t of the King's Ene|mies
; a Merchant comes and buys &s;ome of
them, and &s;ays they are for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or
to &s;ell into <HI>France:</HI> But upon Enquiry it ap|pears
they are bought for Rebellion; the un|de
&s;igning Gun-Smith comes into Trouble of
cour&s;e, and it will be very hard for him to
prove the Negative (<HI>viz.</HI>) That when he has
furni&s;h'd the Rebels with Arms, he had no
Share in the Rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
To bring this home to the Ca&s;e in view, who
were the Men, who in the late Hurry of an
expected Inva&s;ion, &s;unk the Price of Stocks 14
to 15 <HI>per Cent?</HI> Who were the Men that made
a run upon the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and pu&s;ht at
them with &s;ome particular Pique too, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to have run them down, and brought
'em to a Stop of Payment? And what was the
Con&s;equences of the&s;e Things? Will they tell
us that running upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> and lowering
the Stocks, was no Trea&s;on? We know, that
litterally &s;peaking, tho&s;e things are no Trea|&s;on:
But is there not a plain con&s;tructive
Trea&s;on in the Con&s;equences of it? Is
not a wilful running down the publick Cre|dit
, at a Time when the Nation is threaten'd
with an Inva&s;ion from Abroad, and Rebel|lion
at Home? Is not this adding to the Ter|or
of the People? Is not this di&s;abling the
Government, di&s;couraging the King's Friends,
and a vi&s;ible Encouragement of the King's
Enemies? Is not all that is taken from the
Credit of the Publick, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion,
added to the Credit of the Inva&s;ion? Does not
every thing that weakens the Government,
&s;trengthen its Enemies? And is not every Step
that is taken in Prejudice of the King's Intere&s;t
a Step taken in Aid of the de&s;ign'd Rebel|lion?
The kinde&s;t thing that can be &s;aid of a
<PB N="29" REF="30">
certain Triumvirate of Jobbers, who&s;e Hands
have been deepe&s;t in this Part of the Work,
and who indeed had more Obligations upon
them than any other Men in the Town, to
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Publick Intere&s;t, and advan|ced
the Credit of the Nation is, that they did
not think what they did, and that this Excu&s;e
may not &s;erve them another Time, I may &s;oon
furni&s;h them with an Anatomy of &s;ome of the
Conduct of that little Body of <HI>Number Three,</HI>
that when they &s;ee their Mi&s;takes with the
Eyes that other Men &s;ee them, they may at
their Lei&s;ure give a better Turn to the Mea|&s;ures
of Unbounded Avarice.</P>
<P>And now that I may not be &s;aid to &s;peak
without a Precedent, I humbly refer to tho&s;e
money'd Gentlemen to a Ca&s;e recent in Me|mory
, and even in their own, which tho' in|deed
they may think fit to have forgotten for
a time, they will all call to mind when they
hear of it again; and this was the Ca&s;e of
two Gold&s;miths (Knights al&s;o, and one of
them Member of Parliament too) in <HI>Fleet|&s;treet,</HI>
who pu&s;h'd at the Bank of <HI>England</HI> at
the Time that the Pretender's Inva&s;ion from
<HI>France</HI> was in its Preparation: One of them,
it was &s;aid, had gather'd a quantity of Bank-Bills
to the value of near 100,000 l. and the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
other, a great Sum, tho' not &s;o many, and it
was &s;aid, re&s;olv'd to demand them all at once.</P>
<P>Let the Gentlement I point at look back
to the printed Papers that Year, let them en|quire
what Con&s;truction was put upon it; let
them enquire how the Government re&s;ented
it, how my Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>Godolphin</HI> look'd
upon it as a Mine form'd to blow up the
Queen's Affairs, and how, in a Word, all the
Friends of the Government took it to be &s;uch
a Step in favour of the Pretender, as was im|po&s;&s;ible
to con&s;i&s;t with Duty to the Queen.</P>
<P>Let them enquire further, with what Diffi|culty
Sir <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI> wip'd off the Impu|tation
of being a Favourer of the Rebellion,
and how often, in vain, he prote&s;ted, he did it
with no &s;uch View, and how hard the Whiggs
were to believe him. Sir <HI>F&mdash; C&mdash;d</HI> indeed
carry'd it with a higher Hand, and afterwards
pretended to refu&s;e the Bills of the Bank;
but &s;till declar'd he did it as a Gold&s;mith,
and as a piece of Ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, in &s;ome
Points in which the Bank had, as he alledg'd,
us'd him ill. But in general, it was look'd
upon as an open Affront to the Government,
and an abetting and countenancing the Inva|&s;ion
of the Pretender from Abroad, and the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
Rebellion intended at Home: Nor was the
Government, much le&s;s were the Authors of
private Papers and Prints, wanting, in let|ting
them know it; nay, if I am not mi&s;in|form
'd, they were threatned with being trea|ted
as Enemies to the Government, and if
Things had gone on to Extremities, they had
doubtle&s;s been mark'd out as Per&s;ons the Go|vernment
were to take care of.</P>
<P>Now I only &s;peak in plainer Words; It was
&s;aid then, that &s;uch Men as endeavour'd to
run down the Publick Credit, were Enemies
to the Government. I know no Di&s;tinction in
the Ca&s;e, that &s;hould require &s;o much Tender|ne&s;s;
every Subject of King <HI>George,</HI> who is at
the &s;ame time an Enemy to King <HI>George,</HI> is a
Traytor, and every Overt-Act of that Enmity
it being his Duty to his utmo&s;t to favour, aid
and &s;upport the Government, is an Overt
Act of Trea&s;on, let it be gilded over with
what fine Words the Per&s;ons plea&s;e, 'tis the
&s;ame thing, if it is not literal Trea&s;on, and
within reach of the Statute, yet the Crime is
in it &s;elf of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>And let any one tell me, what is the Diffe|rence
between two Dealers in Paper Credit in
the time of a <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion, and three
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Dealers in Paper-Credit in the time of a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Inva&s;ion, or what Sanctity in <HI>Birchin-Lane</HI>
more than in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> that one &s;hould
be a Protection for the &s;ame Practice that
was re&s;ented &s;o ju&s;tly in another.</P>
<P>Were tho&s;e Stock-jobbers &s;incerely and hear|tily
in the Intere&s;t of King <HI>George</HI> and his
Government, as they pretend loudly, what
Run could there be upon the Bank, what Ebb
of Credit, what &s;inking of Stock: The hone&s;t
Whiggs who were Friends to the Government
at that Time mention'd above, who not only
knew their Duty, but how to make it &s;ea&s;on|able
and u&s;eful, acted after another Manner,
when others run upon the Bank with all the
Fury po&s;&s;ible, they carry'd all the Money thi|ther
they could gather up: Nay, I could name
a Man in this City, who having but 500 in
the World, carry'd it all into the Bank to &s;up|port
the Credit of the Publick; and the Story
being told to her Maje&s;ty by the late Lord
Trea&s;urer <HI>Godolphin:</HI> The Sen&s;e of &s;uch Fi|delity
&s;o mov'd the Queen, that &s;he &s;ent him
a Hundred Pounds as a Gift, a Royal Token
of her accepting &s;uch an Act of Loyalty; and
cau&s;ed my Lord to give him an Obligation
from the Trea&s;ury to repay him the whole
500<HI>l.</HI> if any Di&s;a&s;ter to the Bank &s;hould have
made it doubtful.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">
Where's the like Courage and Conduct to
be found now? Is it in Being? Are the Gentle|men
le&s;s able? Or is it that they have not the
&s;ame Zeal for King <HI>George</HI> as that hone&s;t Citi|zen
had for the Queen? Or do they doubt the
King being as &s;en&s;ible of the Service? Or what
is the matter that the Publick Credit had rather
met with injurious Juggling and Jobbing upon
it, than real Support, either from <HI>Exchange-Alley
, Birchin Lane,</HI> or &s;ome other Places le&s;s
noted.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e Men reflect a little upon the Cir|cum&s;tances
the Publick Credit mu&s;t have been
in by &s;uch Management, if the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Attempt
had been made, and if the&s;e Ea&s;terly Prote&s;tant
Winds had not chopt in, by which Providence
has given the Government Time to put it &s;elf
into a Po&s;ture of Defence, &s;o as now not to be
afraid of them; and if the Capital Stock of

In what Manner would Money have been
rais'd upon a new Credit for any immediate

have gone down Hill, Hand in Hand with the

to be the wor&s;t Kind of Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>But it is needful, after having &s;aid thus
much of the Crime, to &s;ay &s;omething of the
Place, and then a little of the Per&s;ons too;
The Center of the Jobbing is <HI>in the Kingdom</HI> of
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> and its Adjacencies; the Li|mits
, are ea&s;ily &s;urrounded in about a Minute
and a half (<HI>viz.</HI>) &s;tepping out of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s into
the Alley, you turn your Face full <HI>South,</HI> mo|ving
on a few Paces, and then turning Due
<HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> you advance to <HI>Garraway</HI>'s; from thence
going out at the other Door, you go on &s;till
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> into <HI>Birchin-Lane,</HI> and then halting a little
at the Sword-Blade Bank to do much Mi&s;chief
in fewe&s;t Words, you immediately face to the

Provinces there in your way <HI>We&s;t:</HI> And thus
having Box'd your Compa&s;s, and &s;ail'd round
the whole Stock-jobbing Globe, you turn into
<HI>Jonathan</HI>'s again; and &s;o, as mo&s;t of the great
Follies of Life oblige as to do, you end ju&s;t
where you began.</P>
<P>But this is by way of Digre&s;&s;ion; and even
&s;till, before I come to the main Ca&s;e, I am
oblig'd to tell you; That though this is the

Sphere of the <HI>Jobbers</HI> Motion, the Orbe to

Where-ever he appears, he makes an <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>

(<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>re&s;olving to be rich at the Price of every
Man they can bubble:</HI> Their fir&s;t Blow was
aimed at the BANK, but there they were
out-witted; and the Great Lord-Trea&s;urer
<HI>Godolphin,</HI> in the late Reign, gave them their
ju&s;t Characters from that Action. The Defeat
they met with there, &s;ticks &s;o clo&s;e to them,
that they re&s;erve the Mea&s;ures of their Re|venge
, nor to cool, no not till the Charter of
the Bank &s;hall expire.</P>
<P>However, their Wings being clipt by the
Clau&s;e then obtain'd in an Act of Parliament,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That no Society, Corporation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould
i&s;&s;ue out Bills of Credit as a Bank, but the
Bank of <HI>England</HI> only; they were obliged
ever &s;ince to turn <HI>Stock-Jobbers,</HI> or if we
may &s;peak properly of them, they are the
<HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI> Ma&s;ters; for they have &s;o many
<HI>Bear-Skins</HI> pawn'd to them at a time, &s;o much
Stock depo&s;ited with them upon Bottomree,
as it might be call'd; that indeed they may
he call'd the City Pawn-Brokers: And I have
been cold, that they have had fifty Stock-Job|bers
and Brokers bound Hand and Foot, and
laid in Heaps at their Doors at a time.</P>
<P>The next Trick they try'd, and which was in+deed
the Ma&s;ter-piece of their Knavery, was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="39" REF="40">
getting an A&s;&s;ignment of the Forfeited E&s;tates
in <HI>Ireland</HI> into their Hands: Indeed they began
the World upon this Pro&s;pect, and expected to
have had the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> mort|gaged
to them: But here too they were di&s;ap|pointed
, and had they not found a Man that
had as much Money as them&s;elves, and more
Hone&s;ty, that Bargain of the Forfeited E&s;tates
had been the la&s;t they had made in the World.</P>
<P>The Endeavours they u&s;e to cheat that
Gentleman, after he had deliver'd them from
a Blow that would have blown them up (is
another black Part of their Story that remains
to be told for the Illu&s;tration of their Chara|cters
at another time:) But in the Interm 'tis
enough to &s;ay, that he who deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d them
as Fools, knew how to deliver him&s;elf from
them as Knaves; and &s;o they were dropt out
of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bargain to their great Mortifica|tion
.</P>
<P>Now they &s;tand ready, as Occa&s;ion offers,
and Profit pre&s;ents, to Stock-jobb the Nation,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ouzen the Parliament, ruffle the Bank, run
up and run down Stocks, and put the Dice upon
the whole Town.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">
They had another Flap with a Fox-Tail,
to the Scandal of their Politicks in the late
Vote about the Tickets of the Lottery which
I mentioned above; what Market they will
make of it is well enough known: But the
Plot was never the le&s;s Cunning, and 'tis
certain the Knavery is not the le&s;s vi&s;ible for
the Mi&s;carriage. I come next to their more
modern Management.</P>
<P>Whenever they call in their Money the
<HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI> mu&s;t &s;ell; the <HI>Bear-skin Men</HI> mu&s;t
commute, and pay Difference money; then
down come the Stocks, tumbling Two or Three
<HI>per Cent.</HI> then the Tools mu&s;t &s;ell, and then
Ma&s;ters buy; the next Week they take in
Stocks again, then the Jobbers buy, and the
Managers &s;ell. Thus the Jobbers bite their
Friends, and the&s;e Men bite the Jobbers, <HI>qui
Sarpat Sharpabitur, Exchange-Alley Latin;</HI> they
that are let into the Secret will under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>The Truth is, it has been foretold by cun|ning
Men, who often &s;ee what can't be hid&punc;
that the&s;e Men, by a Ma&s;s of Money which
they command of other Peoples, as well as
their own, will, in Time, ruin the Jobbing
Trade. But 'twill be only like a general Vi|&s;itation,
where all Di&s;tempers are &s;wallow'd
<PB N="41" REF="42">
up in the Plague, like a common Calamity,
that makes Enemies turn Friends, and drowns
le&s;&s;er Grievances in the general Deluge. For
if the Repri&s;al Trade &s;hould adjourn from
<HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> to <HI>Birchin-Lane,</HI> it may &s;eem to
be like the bani&s;hing U&s;ury from the City
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which transferr'd it to a Jew at
<HI>Genoa,</HI> a Monk at <HI>Naples,</HI> and a Banker at
<HI>Venice,</HI> who, it was &s;aid, had no le&s;s than &s;even
and twenty Principalities in <HI>Italy</HI> mortgag'd
to them at a Time, be&s;ides two Kingdoms,
&s;even Dutchies, and the Jewels of the Crown
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus given the blazing Characters
of three Capital Sharpers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
Knaves of le&s;&s;er Magnitude can have no
room to &s;hine; the Alley throngs with Jews,
Jobbers and Brokers, their Names are need|le
&s;s, their Characters dirty as their Employ|ment
, and the be&s;t thing that I can yet
find out to &s;ay of them, is, that there hap|pens
to be two hone&s;t. Men among them,
Heavens pre&s;erve their Integrity; for the
Place is a Snare, the Employment it &s;elf
fatal to Principle, and hitherto the &s;ame
Ob&s;ervation which I think was very aptly
made upon the Mint, will ju&s;tly turn upon
them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That many an hone&s;t Man
<PB N="42" REF="43">
has gone in to them, but cannot &s;ay that I
ever knew One come an hone&s;t Man out from
them.</P>
<P>But to leave them a little, and turn our
Eyes another way; Is it not &s;urprizing to
find new Faces among the&s;e &s;candalous People,
and Per&s;ons even too big for our Reproof.
Is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>Stars</HI> of another Latitude
&s;hould appear in our Hemi&s;phere? Had it been
<HI>Sims</HI> or <HI>Bowcher,</HI> or Game&s;ters of the Draw|ing-Room
or Ma&s;querades, there had been
little to be &s;aid; or had the Groom-Porter's
been tran&s;pos'd to <HI>Garraway</HI>'s and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s,
it had been nothing new; true Game&s;ters
being always ready to turn their Hand to
any Play. But to &s;ee State&s;men turn Dealers,
and Men of Honour &s;toop to the Chicanry
of Jobbing; to &s;ee Men at the Orfices in the
Morning, at the P&mdash; Hou&s;e about
Noon, at the Cabinet at Night, and at
<HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> in the proper Intervals, What
new <HI>Phoenomina</HI> are the&s;e? What fatal Things
may the&s;e &s;hining Planets (like the late Great
Light) fore-tell to the State, and to the Pub|lick;
for when State&s;men turn Jobbers, the
State may be Jobb'd.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
It may be true, that a Trea&s;urer or Ca&s;h|keeper
may be tru&s;ted with more Money than
he is worth, and many times it is &s;o; and if
the Man be hone&s;t, there may be no harm in
it: But when a Trea&s;urer plays for more Mo|ney
than he is worth, they that tru&s;t him run
a Ri&s;que of their Money, becau&s;e, tho' he may
be an hone&s;t Man he may be undone. I &s;peak
of private, not publick Trea&s;urers.</P>
<P>Indeed it requires &s;ome Apology to &s;ay
&s;uch a One may be an hone&s;t Man; it would
be hard to call him an hone&s;t Man who plays
away any Man's Money that is not his own,
or more than he is able to pay again out of his
own. But if it be di&s;hone&s;t to play it away,
<HI>that is,</HI> lo&s;e it at Play, 'tis equally di&s;hone&s;t to
play with it, whether it be lo&s;t or no, becau&s;e
in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, he that plays for more than
he can pay, his Ma&s;ter runs the Hazard
more than him&s;elf; nay, his Ma&s;ter runs
an unequal Hazard, for if the Money be
lo&s;t, 'tis the Ma&s;ters, if there is Gain, 'tis
the Servants.</P>
<P>Stock-Jobbing is Play; a Box and Dice
may be le&s;s dangerous, the Nature of them
are alike, a Hazard; and if they venture at
either what is not their own, the Knavery
<PB N="44" REF="45">
is the &s;ame. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, any more
than it is &s;afe, to mention the Per&s;ons I may
think of in this Remark; they who are the
Men will ea&s;ily under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>In a Word, I appeal to all the World,
whether a Man that is intru&s;ted with other
Mens Money, (whether Publick or Private, is
not the Que&s;tion) ought to be &s;een in
<HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI> Would it not be a &s;uffici|ent
Objection to any Gentleman or Mer|chant, not to employ any Man to keep his
Ca&s;h, or look after his E&s;tate, to &s;ay of
him <HI>he plays,</HI> he is <HI>a Game&s;ter,</HI> or he is <HI>given
to Gaming</HI> and <HI>Stock-Jobbing,</HI> which is &s;till
wor&s;e, gives the &s;ame, or a &s;tronger Ground
of Objection in the like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Again, are there fewer Sharpers and Set|ters
in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> than at the Groom-Porters? Is there le&s;s Cheating in Stock-Jobbing
than at Play? Or rather is there not
fifty times more? An un-enter'd Youth com|ing
to deal in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> is immediately
&s;urrounded with Bites, Setters, Pointers, and
the wor&s;t &s;ort of Cheats, ju&s;t as a young
Country Gentleman is with Bauds, Pimps,
and Spungers, when he fir&s;t comes to Town.
It is ten Thou&s;and to one, when a forward
<PB N="45" REF="46">
young Trade&s;man &s;teps out of his Shop into
<HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> I &s;ay 'tis ten Thou&s;and to one
but he is undone, if you &s;ee him once but enter
the fatal Door, never di&s;count his Bills after|wards
, never tru&s;t him with Goods at &s;ix
Months Pay any more.</P>
<P>If it be thus dangerous to <HI>the Mean,</HI> what
is it to <HI>the Great?</HI> I &s;ee only this difference,
that in the fir&s;t the Danger is Private, in the
latter Publick.</P>
<P>It has not been many Years &s;ince Electi|ons
for Members of &mdash; came to
Market in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> as current as Lot|tery
Tickets now, and at a Price like the&s;e,
much above what any Parliament allow'd
them to go at; While this was carry'd on,
a great many hone&s;t Men exclaim'd again&s;t
it, and expos'd it; nay, &s;everal Acts of Par|liament
were propos'd for regulating Electi|ons
, and preventing Bribery and Corruption:
But all this would not do, and this indeed
was one of the happy Con&s;equences of that
otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Act for <HI>Triennial Parlia|ments;</HI>
and I firmly believe that it is owe|ing
very much to the late &s;u&s;pending that
Act for a Time, that the&s;e Things are not
come to Market again.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
It may ea&s;ily be remember'd, that the fir&s;t
Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> Men engaging
in the Ca&s;e of Elections of Members, was in
King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, on the famous Di&s;putes
which happen'd between the Old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>

great while, and having embarra&s;s'd not the
City only, but the whole Nation, and even
made it &s;elf dangerous to the Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s,
it was expected it &s;hould be fully decided by the
Hou&s;e of Commons: To this End the Mem|bers
of both Companies, with all the Trick,
Artifice, Cunning and Corruption, that Mo|ney
and Intere&s;t could arm them with, be|&s;tirred
them&s;elves to be cho&s;en Members.</P>
<P>Brokers rid Night and Day from one End of
the Kingdom to the other, to engage Gentle|men
to bribe Corporations, to buy off Compe|titors,
and to manage the Elections. You

the Danger this Stock jobbing Wickedne&s;s had
brought the Publick to, if you plea&s;e to read
the following Exclamation of the hone&s;t Free|holders

<P>'And while all Men ought to be fixing their

</LETTER>
<P>Po&s;tcript.<Q REND="inline"><P>'<HI>IF Sir <HI>E, F, G, H,</HI> will di&s;po&s;e of his Intere&s;t
in the Town of &mdash; I can help him to
very good Terms.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom
this Propo&s;al was made, rejected it with Di&s;|dain
yet the Attempt is made very Plain in
the Ca&s;e.'</P>
<P>'And we are inform'd that the Number of
Members come down into the Countries, on
&s;uch Accounts, are incredible.'</P>
<P>'Wherefore we think it very needful to pub|li&s;h
our Re&s;entments at &s;uch a Practice, and to
prote&s;t again&s;t it in this our Hone&s;t <HI>Plea,</HI> as
an indirect, wicked and pernicious Practice,
and which may be of very ill con&s;equence to
the Nation.'</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">
'If <HI>Stock-Jobbing</HI> of Elections be the fir&s;t
&s;tep, in all probability <HI>Stock-Jobbing</HI> of Votes
will be the &s;econd; for he that will give a
Thou&s;and Pounds, or more, only for a power
to Vote, expects to get &s;omething by Voting,
or gives away his Money for nothing.'</P>
<P>'What &s;hall we &s;ay then, if a League of
Confederacy &s;hou'd be made between our
<HI>Parliament-Solicitors,</HI> and our <HI>Stock-Jobbing
Brokers,</HI> two &s;ort of People equally mercenary
and Deceitful.'</P>
<P>'We de&s;ire to know, whether 'twould not
be more fatal to <HI>England</HI> than the New War
with <HI>Spain,</HI> which all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eems to be &s;o
much di&s;turb'd at.'</P>
<P>'To all Men who&s;e Eyes are to be open'd
with Rea&s;on and Argument, it &s;hou'd be
enough to fill them with abhorrence to think
that the Scandalous Mechanick, Up&s;tart Mi+&s;tery
of Job-broking &s;hould thus grow upon
the Nation; that ever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation
&s;hou'd &s;uffer them&s;elves to be Impos'd on by
the New invented ways of a few Needy Mer|cinaries,
who can turn all Trade into a Lot|tery
, and make the <HI>Exchange</HI> a Gaming
<PB N="53" REF="54">
Table: A thing, which like the Imaginary
Coins of Foreign Nations, have no reality in
them&s;elves; but are plac'd as things which
&s;tand to be Calculated, and reduc'd into Va|lue
, a Trade, made up of Sharp and Trick,
and Manag'd with Impudence and Banter.'</P>
<P>'That Six or Eight Men &s;hall Combine to|gether
, and by pretended Buying or Selling
among them&s;elves, rai&s;e or &s;ink the Stock of
the <HI>E. India</HI> Company, to what extravagant
pitch of Price they will; &s;o to wheedle others
&s;ometimes to Buy, &s;ometimes to Sell, as
their occa&s;ions require; and with &s;o little re|gard
to Intrin&s;ick Value, or the Circum&s;tances
of the Company, that when the Company
has a Lo&s;s, Stock &s;hall Ri&s;e; when a great
Sale, or a Rich Ship arriv'd, it &s;hall Fall:
Sometimes run the Stock down to 35<HI>l.</HI> other
times up to 150<HI>l.</HI> and by this Method Buy
and Sell &s;o much, that 'tis thought there are
few of the Noted Stock-Jobbers, but what
have bought and &s;old more Stock than both
the Companies po&s;&s;e&s;s.'</P>
<P>'Thus let them Jobb, Trick, and Cheat
one another; and let them be bubbl'd by
them that knows no better; but for God's &s;ake
Gentlemen don't let the Important Affairs
<PB N="54" REF="55">
of the State come under their wicked
clutches.'</P>
<P>'Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parlia|ment
and then chu&s;e Members to Vote for
them. If Fate and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Confederacies, and
Union of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers abroad threaten us,
let us alone to &s;truggle with them, and have
Fair Law, and Honourable Conditions for it;
but to be Bought and Sold, to have our Ele|ctions
of Members, and our Laws, Liberties
and E&s;tates Stock-jobb'd away, is intolera|ble.'</P></Q></P>
<P>I &s;aid above, that the Parliament put a
Check to this Practice afterwards by &s;everal
Acts; and the late Act for &s;u&s;pending the Tri|ennial
Bill has at pre&s;ent laid it a &s;&s;ep; but
how far the Practice may revive when a new
Election &s;hall come on, who knows? Never
was more Knaves or more Money in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
and never more needy Gentlemen to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Purcha&s;ers. How nece&s;&s;ary 'tis to
prevent them, let any one judge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what &s;hall we &s;ay to the encroaching
Nature of Immortal Avarice? Has not that
eminent <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> of whom at large above
Stock-jobb'd the very Publick it &s;elf, as I may
<PB N="55" REF="56">
&s;ay, and the very Hou&s;e of Commons; for job|bing
their Funds before they are laid; Stock-jobbing
their Tickets before the Lottery was
found, may in &s;ome Sen&s;e be call'd Stock-job|bing
the Hou&s;e: If then they will even before
the Members Faces, jobb their depending Acts,
and that too before they are pa&s;s'd; &s;hall we
doubt but they will Stock-jobb the Elections
of another Parliament when this is gone
Home?</P>
<P>It is evident, that at pre&s;ent, not being able
to avoid preying upon their Country, they
have been tampering Abroad; Foreign Alarms
is the pre&s;ent Commodity at Market; Choice
of Members may be the next; till in time,
by Strength of Money, they may <HI>Stock-jobb</HI>
Religion, Property, Con&s;titution and Succe&s;|&s;ion;
for nothing can come ami&s;s to them, if
they can but get Money by it; for if the &s;ame
Avarice reigns among them that 'tis evident
is their Guide now, they would with the &s;ame
Facility jobb for the Nation, and without any
Scruple, make a Transfer of King <HI>George</HI> and
his Crown for a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the Value,
to whoever bids the Money.</P>
<P>There was a Book publi&s;h'd &s;ome Years ago,
and when the Stock-jobbing People were thought
<PB N="56" REF="57">
as willing, yet not quite &s;o daring or &s;o cun|ning
as they are now; it was Entitled, <HI>The
Villany of the Stock-jobbers.</HI> Indeed it &s;et them
out in their true Colours, and for &s;ome time
gave them a little Shock; for the Truth was,
they jobb'd King <HI>William</HI> and the Government
at that Time at &s;uch a Rate, that in &s;pight of
the Invincible Valour and Re&s;olution of the
Soldiery, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t Glorious Prince
and mo&s;t Vigilant General the World had
ever &s;een; yet the Enemy gain'd upon us every
Year; the Funds were run down, the Credit
jobb'd away in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> the King and
his Troops devoured by Mechanicks, and &s;old
to U&s;ury, Tallies lay bundled up like <HI>Bath</HI>
Faggots in the Hands of Brokers and Stock-job|bers
; the Parliament gave Taxes, laid Funds,
but the Loans were at the Mercy of tho&s;e Men;
and they &s;hew'd their Mercy indeed, by devour|ing
the King and the Army, the Parliament,
and indeed the whole Nation, bringing that
Great Prince &s;ometimes to that Exigence, thro'
unexpre&s;&s;ible Extortions that were put upon him,
that he has even gone into the Field without
his Equipage, nay, even without his Army;
the Regiments have been uncloathed when the
King has been in the Field, and the willing
brave <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Spirits, eager to honour their
Country, and follow &s;uch a King, have march|ed
<PB N="57" REF="58">
even to Battle, without either Stockings or
Shoes, while his Servants have been every Day
working in <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> to get his own Mo|ney
of the Stock-Jobbers, even after all the
horrible Demands of Di&s;count have been al|lowed
; and at la&s;t, &s;carce 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of the
Money granted by Parliament has come into
the Exchequer, and that late, too late for that
Service, and by Driblets, till the King has
been tir'd with the Delay, and been even ready
to give up the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t now had a Te&s;t of their Cun|ning
on the Subject of the Inva&s;ion: The&s;e
were the Men that made the fir&s;t Advantage of
the News; immediately tho&s;e that were to
put Stock upon any Man at a high Price, ten|der
'd it, the Accepters, forc'd by the Demand,
call in their Money on every Hand, pay the
Difference, the Price falls, a general Run upon
the Bank follows, and Stock-jobbing began it.</P>
<P>Say this was no De&s;ign, yet if every Alarm
of the Fooli&s;h or the Timerous, or the Fal&s;e,
is capable to &s;et the Humour afloat by the
Agency of <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> then <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
is as dangerous to the Publick Safety, as a
Magazine of Gun-powder is to a populous
City.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
But if it be by De&s;ign, then, when-ever the
Pretender is to be pawn'd upon us by any Fo|reign
Power that can but talk of lending 5 or
6000 Men, our Publick Credit is at his Mer|cy
, by the Agency of <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> and the
Brokers.</P>
<P>The Story of the Inva&s;ion from <HI>Spain,</HI> we
hope, is now over: Indeed at the Wor&s;t, I &s;aw
no &s;uch Rea&s;on to be &s;urprized to that Degree,
as was the Ca&s;e here. Let us look back and &s;ee
what Injury to the Publick has the very Ru|mour
been? What Damage to Credit! What
Stop to Trade! What Interruption to our Gene|ral
Commerce! be&s;ides &s;inking above a Million
Sterling upon our E&s;tates; and every Farthing
of this is occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Stock-jobbers,</HI> and in
the Con&s;equences of their Contrivances, and by
no other Means; for as to the De&s;ign of an In|va&s;ion,
or that they re&s;olv'd to come hither at
all, tho' we have evident Proofs of that, becau&s;e
&s;ome of them have been actually landed; yet
we cannot yet re&s;olve the Que&s;tion po&s;itively,
whether it was ever worth our being &s;o much
alarm'd as we have been in <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>Even this Way it appears, that the&s;e Stock-Jobbers
are dangerous to the Peace, &s;ince 'tis
in their Power to &s;et a Rate when-ever they
plea&s;e, not only upon private E&s;tates, but
<PB N="59" REF="60">
even upon the whole Nation, and in that Ca|pacity
it is to be hoped, the Parliament, who
have hitherto redre&s;s'd the Publick Grievances,
will take care of the&s;e People in particular, and
deliver the Publick from &s;uch a Set of Men as
are more fatal to them, than a Midnight Fire,
more dangerous than an Enemy Embark'd,
nay, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, than an Enemy
Landed.</P>
<P>For, in a word, the&s;e Men take upon them
to put a Standard upon our Fears; and we
are to ask them, when Intelligence comes from
Abroad, whether any thing be to be &s;lighted
or apprehended; every publick Piece of News,
every Menace of the Nation's Enemies is to re|ceive
its Weight from them; and the Price of
Stocks is the Rule by which we are to guide
our Judgment in Publick Affairs, by which
we are either to hope or to fear when any
thing ami&s;s pre&s;ent it &s;elf to our View.</P>
<P>Is this an Advantage fit to be put into the
Hand of a Subject? Are the King's Affairs to
go up and down as they plea&s;e, and the Credit
of his Maje&s;ty's Councils ri&s;e and fall as the&s;e
Men &s;hall plea&s;e to value them? This would
be making them Kings, and making the King
Subject to the Caprice of their private Inter&s;t,
<PB N="60" REF="61">
his Affairs be liable to be rated in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI>
and to be run down as they plea&s;ed;
an Article, which as the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, in
the fir&s;t Politicks of the Church, made all the
Kings of the Earth become Pen&s;ioners to the
Prie&s;ts, &s;o it would make all the Kings of <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
Pen&s;ioners to <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, it looks as if this were
the pre&s;ent View in the Manner which Stock-Jobbing
now goes on; and there are more
Mi&s;chiefs in it than perhaps we are aware of,
the Extremes either way &s;eem dangerous
enough, for Example,</P>
<P>If one way the Stock-Jobbers manage the
Publick, they &s;candalou&s;ly &s;ubject the Govern|ment
, the Mini&s;ters of State, the Publick
Credit, nay, even the Elections of Parliament
to their Orders: So if a Government &s;hould
come ab&s;olutely to get the Management of the
Stock-Jobbers, it might be many Ways fatal
to the Peoples Intere&s;t, and indeed put the
Pur&s;e-Strings of the Nation &s;o much into the
Hands of a Mini&s;try, that if they did not at
any time command the general Trea&s;ure, and be
able to rai&s;e what Money they pleas'd without
a Parliament, they would be able to add what
Value they plea&s;ed to the Funds given, rai&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="62">
them when they pleas'd to draw Money in,
and &s;ink them when they plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue Mo|ney
out: That in a word, the Rate of Stocks
&s;hould be &s;ettled every Day in the <HI>Exchequer;</HI>
and tho' they might not be &s;aid to &s;tand no more
in need of Parliaments, it would be mo&s;t cer|tain
, that they would not &s;tand in &s;o much
need of Parliaments as they u&s;ed to do, and
as it is convenient for us they &s;hould do.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t run out a great Length in the Enume|ration
of the Mi&s;chief to the Liberty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
which might attend &s;uch a Thing as
this; and tho' at pre&s;ent it may be objected,
that it is unrea&s;onable, and entirely needle&s;s,
becau&s;e we are under a King that &s;tands in
need of no Artifices, and is too ju&s;t to attempt
any Encroachment on the Liberties of his
People, and a Mini&s;try, who we have rea&s;on
to hope are above taking any &s;uch mean Steps;
yet if ever a Time &s;hall come again, when eve|ry
Politick Step &s;hall be enquired after to bring
Gri&s;t to the Publick Mill, and every way that
can be found practicable, &s;hall be thought ju|&s;tifiable;
then let you Citizens of <HI>London</HI> have
a care of a Bear-skin-Court, and a Stock-Job|bing
Mini&s;try, when <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> &s;hall be
tran&s;pos'd to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and States-men
&s;hall make a Property of the Brokers.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
This is indeed a Thing remote, and as I &s;ay
above, there is no Danger of its happening in
this Reign, &s;o it may never happen at all: But
as I al&s;o &s;ay, without the lea&s;t Reflection upon
our pre&s;ent Government, that &s;uch a Time may
come, and &s;uch a Thing may happen; &s;o I af|firm
, the State of Things ought forthwith to be
annihilated if po&s;&s;ible, which is but in its Na|ture
capable of being thus perverted, and we
ought not to leave our Po&s;terity in a Condition
to be devoured by &s;uch Caterpillars, if it be in
our Power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Why may not any collected Stock of Money,
&s;uch as that we have mention'd before, to be in
the Management of the <HI>Birchin-Lane Company,</HI>
be manag'd in the Hands of Courtiers, as well
as of Citizens; Mini&s;ters of State, as well as
Inhabitants of <HI>Hackney;</HI> and to how many more
unlucky Purpo&s;es may &s;uch Men apply that
Power? The&s;e Men indeed proceed, with Trick
and Cunning, to ama&s;s great E&s;tates, and to
enrich them&s;elves and their Families out of the
Spoils of the People, their Neighbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
in this we think they cannot have too much of
our ju&s;t Satyr be&s;tow'd upon them; but if this
Engine of Jobbing &s;hould once come into the
Hands of Mini&s;ters of State; if a degenerated
Government &s;hould come to u&s;e it, as &s;uch a
<PB N="63" REF="64">
Government may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to do,
what Mi&s;chiefs may they not bring upon the
Nation? And what may they not be able to
do, if their De&s;igns are but wicked enough to
pu&s;h them on?</P>
<P>It would be hard to &s;ay to what Length this
Jobbing Trade might be extended, e&s;pecially
whereby the Advantage of a punctual Manage|ment,
the publick Credit has &s;o far gain'd upon
the People, as to bring the Rate of Funds and
Stocks to exceed the Intrin&s;ick Value, and to
keep upon an Advance: What may not a
Government, who has the Command of Mo|ney,
do in the particular Art of Screwing up,
or Screwing down the publick Intere&s;ts and
Securities?</P>
<P>'Tis a copious Subject, our <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI>
Men under&s;tand it well enough; and if they
were put to give their Opinions, and had Ho|ne&s;ty
enough to &s;peak the Truth again&s;t their
Intere&s;t, they would acknowledge their Trade
is capable of ruining ten Nations, if it was
carried on to the full Extent of it.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Sheets were at the Pre&s;s, we had
another little Te&s;t of their Knavery to the
Publick; and it is not at all owing to them, that
the Thing run no further; the contrary Winds
<PB N="64" REF="65">
and Storms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had di&s;appointed the King's
Enemies, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet was driven back
to <HI>Spain</HI> in a &s;hatter'd and defeated Condition,
as appears by the Publick Account of tho&s;e
Things: But in the Interval of this News,
came an Account on the other Hand, that &s;ome
of the Party were arriv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they
had beat it up, notwith&s;tanding all the Oppo|&s;ition
of Nature, the Hindrances of Winds
and Seas; immediately Stocks fell Two <HI>per Cent.</HI>
nor did the good News of the Defeated return
of the re&s;t animate the&s;e Men to keep up the
Intere&s;t, by which it appears, that they are
acted more by the bad Principle than by the
good; that they choo&s;e rather to do Evil than
to do Good: that they &s;ink fa&s;ter than they
ri&s;e, and are willinger to do Harm than Good
to the Government.</P>
<P>From whence I infer, that the Government,
looking upon them as they really are, rather
Enemies than Friends to the General Intere&s;t,
&s;hould rather encline to root them out, than
pre&s;erve them. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
