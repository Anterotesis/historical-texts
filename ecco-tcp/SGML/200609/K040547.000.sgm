<P>The following Poem was wrote &s;everal Years ago: As
it may do good to &s;ome, and cannot hurt the Re|putation
of the Author, though he &s;hould be known,
I have given it to my Book&s;eller to publi&s;h. It con|tains
&s;ome Thoughts of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa&s;cal,</HI> which can|not
make it le&s;s acceptable to the Publick.</P>

<L>_WHAT am I? how produc'd? and for what End?</L>
<L>Whence drew I Being? to what Period
tend?</L>
<L>Am I th' abandon'd Orphan of blind Chance;</L>
<L>Dropt by wild Atoms, in di&s;order'd Dance?</L>
<L>Or from an endle&s;s Chain of Cau&s;es wrought?</L>
<L>And of unthinking Sub&s;tance, born with Thought?</L>
<L>By Motion which began without a Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Supremely wi&s;e, without De&s;ign, or Laws.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
Am I but what I &s;eem, mere Fle&s;h and Blood;</L>
<L>A branching Channel, with a mazy Flood?</L>
<L>The purple Stream that through my Ve&s;&s;els glides,</L>
<L>Dull and uncon&s;cious flows like common Tides:</L>
<L>The Pipes thro' which the circling Juices &s;tray,</L>
<L>Are not that thinking I, no more than They:</L>
<L>This Frame, compacted with tran&s;cendent Skill,</L>
<L>Of moving Joints, obedient to my Will;</L>
<L>Nurs'd from the fruitful Glebe, like yonder Tree,</L>
<L>Waxes and wa&s;tes; I call it Mine, not Me:</L>
<L>New Matter &s;till the mould'ring Ma&s;s &s;u&s;tains,</L>
<L>The Man&s;ion chang'd, the Tenant &s;till remains;</L>
<L>And from the fleeting Stream repair'd by Food,</L>
<L>Di&s;tinct, as is the Swimmer from the Flood.</L>
<L>What am I then? Sure, of a nobler Birth,</L>
<L>Thy Parents Right, I own a Mother, <HI>Earth</HI>;</L>
<L>But claim &s;uperior Lineage by my SIRE,</L>
<L>Who warm'd th' unthinking Clod with heav'nly Fire:</L>
<L>E&s;&s;ence divine, with lifele&s;s Clay allay'd,</L>
<L>By double Nature, double In&s;tinct &s;way'd;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">
With Look erect, I dart my longing Eye,</L>
<L>Seem wing'd to part, and gain my native Sky;</L>
<L>I &s;trive to mount, but &s;trive, alas! in vain,</L>
<L>Ty'd to this ma&s;&s;y Globe with magick Chain.</L>
<L>Now with &s;wift Thought I range from Pole to Pole</L>
<L>View Worlds around their flaming Centers roll:</L>
<L>What &s;teddy Powers their endle&s;s Motions guide,</L>
<L>Thro' the &s;ame tractle&s;s Paths of boundle&s;s Void!</L>
<L>I trace the blazing Comet's fiery Trail,</L>
<L>And weigh the whirling Planets in a Scale:</L>
<L>The&s;e Godlike Thoughts, while eager I pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Some glitt'ring Trifle offer'd to my view,</L>
<L>A Gnat, an In&s;ect, of the meane&s;t kind,</L>
<L>Era&s;e the new-born Image from my Mind;</L>
<L>Some bea&s;tly Want, craving, importunate,</L>
<L>Vile as the grinning Ma&s;tiffs at my Gate,</L>
<L>Calls off from heav'nly Truth this reas'ning Me,</L>
<L>And tells me I'm a Brute as much as He.</L>
<L>If on &s;ublimer Wings of Love and Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>My Soul above the &s;tarry Vault I rai&s;e,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">
Lur'd by &s;ome vain Conceit, or &s;hameful Lu&s;t,</L>
<L>I flag, I drop, and flutter in the Du&s;t.</L>
<L>The tow'ring Lark, thus, from her lofty Strain,</L>
<L>Stoops to an Emmet, or a Barley Grain.</L>
<L>By adver&s;e Gu&s;ts of jarring In&s;tincts to&s;t,</L>
<L>I rove to one, now to the other Coa&s;t;</L>
<L>To Bli&s;s unknown my lofty Soul a&s;pires,</L>
<L>My Lot unequal to my va&s;t De&s;ires.</L>
<L>As 'mong&s;t the Hinds a Child of Royal Birth</L>
<L>Finds his high Pedigree, by con&s;cious Worth;</L>
<L>So Man, among&s;t his Fellow-Brutes expos'd,</L>
<L>Sees he's a King, but 'tis a King depos'd:</L>
<L>Pity him, Bea&s;ts! you by no Law confin'd,</L>
<L>Are barr'd from devious Paths, by being blind;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Man, through op'ning Views of various Ways</L>
<L>Confounded, by the Aid of Knowledge, &s;trays;</L>
<L>Too weak to choo&s;e, yet choo&s;ing &s;till in ha&s;te,</L>
<L>One Moment gives the Plea&s;ure and Di&s;ta&s;te;</L>
<L>Bilk'd by pa&s;t Minutes, while the pre&s;ent cloy,</L>
<L>The flatt'ring future &s;till mu&s;t give the Joy.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">
Not happy, but amus'd upon the Road,</L>
<L>And (like you) thoughtle&s;s of his la&s;t Abode,</L>
<L>Whether next Sun his Being &s;hall re&s;train,</L>
<L>To endle&s;s Nothing, Happine&s;s, or Pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around me, lo, the thinking, thoughtle&s;s Crew</L>
<L>(Bewilder'd each) their diff'rent Paths pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>Of them I ask the Way; the fir&s;t replies,</L>
<L>Thou art a God; and &s;ends me to the Skies.</L>
<L>Down on this Turf (the next) thou two-legg'd Bea&s;t,</L>
<L>There fix thy Lot, thy Bli&s;s, and endle&s;s Re&s;t:</L>
<L>Between tho&s;e wide Extremes the length is &s;uch,</L>
<L>I find I know too little or too much.</L>

<L>This &s;aid, expanded lay the &s;acred Text,</L>
<L>The Balm, the Light, the Guide of Souls perplext:</L>
<L>Thus the benighted Traveller that &s;trays</L>
<L>Through doubtful Paths, enjoys the Morning Rays;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">
The nightly Mi&s;t, and thick de&s;cending Dew,</L>
<L>Parting, unfold the Fields, and vaulted Blue.</L>
<L>" O Truth divine! enlightned by thy Ray,</L>

<L>" Thou cleard&s;t the Secret of my high De&s;cent,</L>
<L>And told me what tho&s;e my&s;tick Tokens meant;</L>
<L>Marks of my Birth, which I had worn in vain,</L>
<L>Too hard for worldly Sages to explain;</L>
<L><HI>Zeno</HI>'s were vain, vain <HI>Epicurus</HI>' Schemes,</L>
<L>Their Sy&s;tems fal&s;e, delu&s;ive were their Dreams;</L>
<L>Unskill'd my two-fold Nature to divide,</L>
<L>One nurs'd my Plea&s;ure, and one nurs'd my Pride:</L>
<L>Tho&s;e jarring Truths which Human Art beguile,</L>
<L>Thy &s;acred Page thus bid me reconcile.</L>
<L>Offspring of God, no le&s;s thy Pedigree,</L>
<L>What thou once wer't, art now, and &s;till may be,</L>
<L>Thy God alone can tell, alone decree;</L>
<L>Faultle&s;s thou dropt from his unerring Skill,</L>
<L>With the bare Pow'r to &s;in, &s;ince free of Will:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">
Yet charge not with thy Guilt, his bounteous Love,</L>
<L>For who has Power to walk, has Power to rove;</L>
<L>Who acts by force impell'd, can nought de&s;erve;</L>
<L>And Wi&s;dom &s;hort of infinite, may &s;werve.</L>
<L>Born on thy new-imp'd Wings, thou took'&s;t thy Flight,</L>
<L>Left thy Creator, and the Realms of Light;</L>
<L>Di&s;dain'd his gentle Precept to fulfil;</L>
<L>And thought to grow a God by doing ill:</L>
<L>Though by foul Guilt thy heav'nly Form defac'd,</L>
<L>In Nature chang'd, from happy Man&s;ions chac'd,</L>
<L>Thou &s;till retain'&s;t &s;ome Sparks of heav'nly Fire,</L>
<L>Too faint to mount, yet re&s;tle&s;s to a&s;pire;</L>
<L>Angel enough to &s;eek thy Bli&s;s again,</L>
<L>And Brute enough to make the Search in vain.</L>
<L>The Creatures now withdraw their kindly U&s;e,</L>
<L>Some fly thee, &s;ome torment, and &s;ome &s;educe;</L>
<L>Repa&s;t ill &s;uited to &s;uch diff'rent Gue&s;ts,</L>
<L>For what thy Sen&s;e de&s;ires, thy Soul di&s;ta&s;tes;</L>
<L>Thy Lu&s;t, thy Curio&s;ity, thy Pride,</L>
<L>Curb'd, or deferr'd, or balk'd, or gratify'd,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10">
Rage on, and make thee equally unble&s;s'd</L>
<L>In what thou want'&s;t, and what thou ha&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t;</L>
<L>In vain thou hop'&s;t for Bli&s;s on this poor Clod,</L>
<L>Return, and &s;eek thy Father, and thy God:</L>
<L>Yet think not to regain thy native Sky,</L>
<L>Born on the Wings of vain Philo&s;ophy;</L>
<L>My&s;terious Pa&s;&s;age! hid from human Eyes;</L>
<L>Soaring you'll &s;ink, and &s;inking you will ri&s;e:</L>
<L>Let humble Thoughts thy wary Foot&s;teps guide,</L>
<L>Regain by Meekne&s;s what you lo&s;t by Pride.</L>
