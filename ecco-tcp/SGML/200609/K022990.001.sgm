<P>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to &s;ee and conver&s;e with a Man, whom in his Writings I had &s;o long known with Plea&s;ure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very fir&s;t meeting, doing ju&s;tice to your dead friend Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I was not &s;o happy as to know him; <HI>Virgilium tantum vidi</HI>&mdash;Had I been born early enough, I mu&s;t have known and lov'd him: For I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, not only by your &s;elf, but by Mr.
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<HI>Congreve</HI> and Sir <HI>William Trumbul,</HI> that his per&s;onal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwith&s;tanding the many libel|ous Mi&s;repre&s;entations of them (again&s;t which the former of the&s;e Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He &s;ince did &s;o, in his Dedication to the Duke of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> prefix'd to <HI>Ton&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Duodecimo</HI> Edition of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, 1717.</NOTE>) I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his &s;ucce&s;s and fame: And tho&s;e Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's evening, which are never very trouble&s;ome but in the fine&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Sea&s;on; (for his fire, like the Sun's, &s;hin'd cleare&s;t towards its &s;et|ting.)</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own perfor|mances that they were above tho&s;e Cri|ticks, I was &s;o vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be &s;o humble as to think my &s;elf quite below their notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na|tural inclination to Carrion: And though &s;uch poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is &s;o poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is &s;o beggarly but he can keep a Critic. So I'm far from
<PB N="3" REF="3">
thinking the Attacks of &s;uch people either any honour or di&s;honour, even to me, much le&s;s to Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I think with you, that whatever le&s;&s;er Wits have ri&s;en &s;ince his Death, are but like Stars appearing when the Sun is &s;et, that twinkle only in his ab&s;ence, and with the Rays they have borrowed from him. Our Wit (as you call it) is but Reflexion or Imitation, there|fore &s;carce to be call'd ours. True Wit I believe, may be defin'd a Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought, and a Facility of Expre&s;&s;ion; or (in the Midwives phra&s;e) a perfect Conception, with an ea&s;y Delivery. However this is far from a compleat definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</P>

<P>I HAVE been &s;o bu&s;y of late in cor|recting and tran&s;cribing &s;ome of my Madrigals, for a great Man or two who de&s;ir'd to &s;ee them, that I have (with your Pardon) omitted to return you an An&s;wer to your mo&s;t ingenious Letter: So Scrib|lers to the Publick, like Bankers to the Pub|lick, are profu&s;e in their voluntary Loans
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to it, whil&s;t they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more ju&s;t Debts, to their be&s;t and neare&s;t Friends. How|ever, I hope, you who have as much good Nature as good Sen&s;e, (&s;ince they gene|rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In|clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time &s;hould con&s;ider, when you have oblig'd me beyond my pre&s;ent Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an hone&s;t Man, if he but intends to be ju&s;t when he is able, tho' late. But I &s;hould be le&s;s ju&s;t to you, the more I thought I could make a Re|turn to &s;o much Profu&s;ene&s;s of Wit and Humanity together; which tho' they &s;el|dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you &s;o equally met, I know not in which you mo&s;t abound. But &s;o much for my Opinion of you, which is, that your Wit and Ingenuity is equal'd by no|thing but your Judgment, or Mode&s;ty; which (though it be to plea&s;e my &s;elf) I mu&s;t no more offend, than I can do either right.</P>
<P>Therefore I will &s;ay no more now of them, than that your good Wit ne'er for|feited your good Judgment, but in your Partility to me and mine; &s;o that if it
<PB N="3" REF="5">
were po&s;&s;ible for a harden'd Scribbler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited, than what I &s;cribble my &s;elf; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I ought to be more humbled by your Prai&s;e than exalted; which commends my little Sen&s;e with &s;o much more of yours, that I am di&s;parag'd and di&s;hearten'd by your com|mendations; who give me an Example of your Wit in the fir&s;t Part of your Letter, and a Definition of it in the la&s;t: to make writing well (that is like you) more dif|ficult to me than ever it was before. Thus the more great and ju&s;t your Example and Definition of Wit are, the le&s;s I am capa|ble to follow them. Then the be&s;t way of &s;hewing my Judgment, after having &s;een how you write, is to leave off writing; and the be&s;t way to &s;hew my Friendship to you, is to put an end to your Trouble, and to conclude</P>

<P>WHEN I write to you, I fore&s;ee a long Letter, and ought to beg your
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longe&s;t, it will be of cour&s;e the wor&s;t I have troubled you with. Yet to expre&s;s my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Intere&s;t; as &s;ome People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindne&s;s, to put you in mind of be&s;towing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more di&s;tinctly I &s;ee my Faults; Spots and Blemi&s;hes you know, are never &s;o plainly di&s;covere'd as in the brighte&s;t Sun|&s;hine. Thus I am mortified by tho&s;e Com|mendations which were de&s;ign'd to encou|rage me: for Prai&s;e to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode|rately be&s;tow'd, it chears and revives, but if too lavi&s;hly, overcharges and depre&s;&s;es him. Mo&s;t Men in years, as they are ge|nerally di&s;couragers of Youth, are like old Trees, that being pa&s;t Bearing them&s;elves, will &s;uffer no young Plants to flouri&s;h be|neath them: But as if it were not enough to have out-done all your Coaevals in Wit, you will excel them in good Nature too. As for my <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His <HI>Pa&s;torals,</HI> written at 16 Years of Age.</NOTE> green E&s;&s;ays, if you find any plea&s;ure in 'em, it mu&s;t be &s;uch as a Man naturally takes in ob&s;erving the fir&s;t Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he
<PB N="5" REF="7">
has rais'd him&s;elf: and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be e&s;teem'd any otherwi&s;e, than as we value Fruits for being early, which ne|verthele&s;s are the mo&s;t in&s;ipid, and the wor&s;t of the Year. In a word, I mu&s;t blame you for treating me with &s;o much Compliment, which is at be&s;t but the Smoak of Friend&s;hip. I neither write, nor con|ver&s;e with you, to gain your Prai&s;e but your Affection. Be &s;o much my Friend as to appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults, if not as a young Man, at lea&s;t as an un|experienc'd Writer.</P>

<P>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <HI>March</HI> I have receiv'd, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Ju&s;tice, for giving you your Due; who &s;hou'd not let your Mode&s;ty be &s;o unju&s;t to your Merit, as to reject
<PB N="6" REF="8">
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is &s;o &s;hort of your de&s;ert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend|&s;hip (as you &s;ay) however you mu&s;t allow there is no Smoak but there is &s;ome Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incen&s;e offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half &s;o &s;weet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; &s;o Friend&s;hip like Love, cannot be without &s;ome Incen&s;e, to perfume the Name it wou'd prai&s;e and immortalize. But &s;ince you &s;ay you do not write to me to gain my <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> but my <HI>Affection,</HI> pray how is it po&s;&s;ible to have the one without the other? We mu&s;t admire before we love. You affirm, you would have me &s;o much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be &s;o hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be per&s;uaded to it. Be|&s;ides, the Vanity of a Scribbler is &s;uch, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; e&s;pecially when he mu&s;t take Pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your &s;elf, I cannot &s;uffer you to murther your fame, with your own hand, without oppo&s;ing you; e&s;pecially when you &s;ay your la&s;t Let|ter
<PB N="7" REF="9">
is the wor&s;t (&s;ince the longe&s;t) you have favoured me with; which I therefore think the be&s;t, as the longe&s;t Life (if a good one) is the be&s;t, as it yields the more Variety and is more Exemplary; as a chearful Summer's Day, tho' longer than a dull one in the Winter, is le&s;s tedious and more entertain|ing: Therefore let but your Friend&s;hip be like your Letter, as la&s;ting as it is agreeable, and it can never be tedious, but more ac|ceptable and obliging to</P>

<P>I HAVE receiv'd yours of the Fifth, wherein your Mode&s;ty refu&s;es the ju&s;t Prai&s;e I give you, by which you lay claim to more, as a Bi&s;hop gains his Bi&s;hoprick by &s;aying he will not Epi&s;copate: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, whil&s;t I di&s;plea&s;e you by commend|ing you, I plea&s;e my &s;elf; ju&s;t as Incen&s;e is &s;weeter to the Offerer than the Deity to whom 'tis offered, by his being &s;o much above it: For indeed, every Man partakes of the Prai&s;e he gives, when it is &s;o ju&s;tly given.</P>

As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> you may allow me to make it, &s;ince no old Man can give &s;o young, &s;o great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea|lou&s;y. I am, in my Enquiry, like old Sir <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coign,</HI> who us'd to &s;ay, That when he was grown too old to have his Vi&s;its admitted alone by the Ladies, he always took along with him a young Man, to en&s;ure his Welcome to them; who, had he come alone had been rejected, only becau&s;e his Vi&s;its were not &s;candalous to them. So I am (like an old Rook, who is ruin'd by Gaming) forc'd to live on the good For|tune of the pu&s;hing young Men, who&s;e Fancies are &s;o vigorous, that they en&s;ure their Succe&s;s in their Adventures with the Mu&s;es, by their Strength of Imagination.</P>
<P>&mdash;Your Papers are &s;afe in my Cu&s;tody (you may be &s;ure) from any one's Theft but my own; for 'tis as dangerous to tru&s;t a Scribbler with your Wit, as a Game&s;ter with the Cu&s;tody of your Money.&mdash;If you happen to come to Town, you will make it more difficult for me to leave it, who am, dear Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI></P>

<P>_I Cannot contend with you. You mu&s;t give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your De&s;ign is to encourage me. But I &s;eparate from all the re&s;t that Paragraph or two, in which you make me &s;o warm an Offer of your Friend|&s;hip. Were I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of That, it would put an End to all tho&s;e Speeches with which you now make me blu&s;h; and change them to whol&s;ome Advices, and free Sen|timents, which might make me wi&s;er and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friend&s;hip is be&s;t contracted betwixt Per&s;ons of equal Age: but I have &s;o much Intere&s;t to be of another Mind, that you mu&s;t pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in oppo&s;ition to that Opinion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally cau&s;ed by our finding the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;itions in them, which we feel in our &s;elves. This is but Self-love at the Bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be &s;uch, the Inclinations of &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="12">
being commonly various. The Friend&s;hip of two young Men is often occa&s;ioned by Love of Plea&s;ure or Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, each being de&s;irous, for his own &s;ake, of one to a&s;&s;i&s;t or incourage him in the Cour&s;es he pur&s;ues; as that of two old Men is fre|quently on the &s;core of &s;ome Profit, Lucre, or De&s;ign upon others: Now, as a young Man who is le&s;s acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability le&s;s of Intere&s;t; and an old Man who may be weary of him&s;elf, le&s;s of Self-love; &s;o the Friend&s;hip between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self-regard. One may add to this, that &s;uch a Friend&s;hip is of greater U&s;e and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to plea&s;e the young one; and the young Man more di&s;creet and pru|dent by the help of the old one; &s;o it may prove a Cure of tho&s;e epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es of Age and Youth, Sourne&s;s and Madne&s;s. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Po&s;&s;ibility of this; One alone abundantly &s;atisfies me, and con|vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> under Seventeen.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Shou'd believe my &s;elf happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me &s;o much in a Style of Compliment. It has been ob&s;erv'd of Women, that they are more &s;ubject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac|count of their being generally treated this way; but the weake&s;t Women are not more &s;o than that weak cla&s;s of Men, who are thought to pique them|&s;elves upon their Wit. The World is ne|ver wanting, when a Coxcomb is accom|pli&s;hing him&s;elf, to help to give him the fini&s;hing Stroke.</P>
<P>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh|bour over&s;tock'd with Vanity, yet I can|not but fancy, there are certain Times, when mo&s;t people are in a di&s;po&s;ition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a va&s;t Good a little Truth might do, &s;po|ken in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons. A very &s;mall Alms will do a great kindne&s;s, to people in ex|tream nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think him&s;elf more obliged to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Fol|lies. If you would make tho&s;e the &s;ubject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wi&s;h your Letters always were.</P>
<P>I do not wonder you have hitherto found &s;ome difficulty (as you are pleas'd to &s;ay) in writing to me, &s;ince you have always cho&s;en the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my Ver&s;es which you prai&s;e &s;o much, I may truly &s;ay they had never been the cau&s;e of any Vanity in me, ex|cept what they gave me when they fir&s;t occa&s;ion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have &s;everal times &s;ince been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, the greate&s;t magnifying Gla&s;&s;es in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per|&s;on; yet even in tho&s;e, I cannot fancy my &s;elf &s;o extremely like <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as you wou'd per&s;uade me: If I mu&s;t be like him, 'tis you will make me &s;o,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
by complimenting me into a better opinion of my &s;elf than I de&s;erve: They made him think he was the <HI>Son of Jupiter,</HI> and you a&s;&s;ure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can &s;ay to my honour? You &s;aid ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a &s;hare in your af|fection, to treat me with Compliments and &s;weet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <HI>Sancho Panca:</HI> They had per&s;uaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t up|on but <HI>Wafers</HI> and <HI>Marmalade.</HI> In our Days, the greate&s;t obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wi&s;e Men give them their Way, and plea&s;e them as well as they can; &s;o when tho&s;e incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco|verably Be-Mus'd, the be&s;t way both to quiet them, and &s;ecure your &s;elves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the mo&s;t part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be hear|tily glad that all you &s;ay were as true, ap|ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your &s;elf, for &s;everal weighty Rea&s;ons; but for none &s;o much, as that I might be to you what you

<P>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country; from <HI>Will</HI>'s Coffee-Hou&s;e to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the com|mon Town-Wits, and the downright Coun|try Fools; that the fir&s;t are pertly in the Wrong, with a little more Flouri&s;h and Gaiety, and the la&s;t neither in the Right nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a &s;tupid, &s;ettled Medium betwixt both. However, methinks the&s;e are mo&s;t in the Right, who quietly and ea&s;ily re&s;ign them&s;elves over to the gentle Reign of Dulne&s;s, which the Wits mu&s;t do at la&s;t, tho' after a great deal of Noi&s;e, Pother, and Re&s;i&s;tance. Ours are a &s;ort of mode&s;t, inoffen&s;ive People, who neither have Sen&s;e, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulne&s;s. They are commonly known in the World by the Name of hone&s;t, civil Gentlemen. They live much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting Life, pur&s;uing with earne&s;tne&s;s and hazard, &s;omething not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but prefer Solitude to the Company of all the&s;e; for tho' a
<PB N="12" REF="18">
Man's &s;elf may po&s;&s;ibly be the wor&s;t Fel|low to conver&s;e with in the World, yet one would think the Company of a Per&s;on whom we have the greate&s;t regard to, and affection for, could not be very un|plea&s;ant: As a Man in love with a Mi|&s;tre&s;s, de&s;ires no Conver&s;ation but hers, &s;o a Man in love with him&s;elf, (as mo&s;t Men are) may be be&s;t plea&s;ed with his own. Be&s;ides, if the true&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful Know|ledge, be the knowledge of our &s;elves, So|litude conducing mo&s;t to make us look into our &s;elves, &s;hould be the mo&s;t in&s;tructive State of Life. We &s;ee nothing more com|monly, than Men, who for the &s;ake of the circum&s;tantial Part, and meer out&s;ide of Life, have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature, and ought to be &s;ent into Solitude to &s;tudy them&s;elves over again. People are u&s;ually &s;poil'd in&s;tead of being taught, at their coming into the World; whereas by being more conver&s;ant with Ob&s;curity, without any Pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So|litude is his be&s;t School; and if he be a Fool, it is his be&s;t Sanctuary.</P>
<P>The&s;e are good Rea&s;ons for my own Stay here, but I wi&s;h I could give you any for your coming hither, except that I earne&s;tly invite you. And yet I can't help
<PB N="13" REF="19">
&s;aying, I have &s;uffer'd a great deal of di&s;|content that you do not, tho' I &s;o little merit that you &s;hould.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of your la&s;t: Tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Wit, like tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Money, are generally mo&s;t &s;paring of either.</P>

<P>YOURS of the 26th of <HI>October</HI> I have receiv'd, as I have always done yours, with no little Satisfaction, and am proud to di&s;cover by it, that you find fault with the &s;hortne&s;s of mine, which I think the be&s;t Excu&s;e for it: And tho' they (as you &s;ay) who have mo&s;t Wit or Money, are mo&s;t &s;paring of either; there are &s;ome who ap|pear Poor to be thought Rich, and are Poor, which is my Ca&s;e: I cannot but rejoyce, that you have undergone &s;o much di&s;content for want of my company; but if you have a Mind to puni&s;h me for my fault, (which I could not help) defer your coming to Town, and you will do it ef|fectually. But I know your Charity always exceeds your Revenge, &s;o that I will not

You may have the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee one Pack of Blood|hounds pur&s;ue another Herd of Brutes, to bring each other to their Fall, which is their whole Sport: Or, if you affect a le&s;s bloody Chace, you may &s;ee a Pack of Spa|niels, called <HI>Lovers,</HI> in hot pur&s;uit of a two-legg'd <HI>Vixen,</HI> who only flies the whole low'd Pack to be &s;ingled out by one Dog, who runs mute to catch her up the &s;ooner from the re&s;t, as they are making a Noi&s;e, to the Lo&s;s of their Game. In fine, this is the Time for all &s;orts of Sport in the Town, when tho&s;e of the Country cea&s;e; there|fore leave your Fore&s;t of Bea&s;ts, for ours of Brutes, call'd Men, who now in full Cry, (pack'd by the Court or Country) run down in the Hou&s;e of Commons, a de|&s;erted horned Bea&s;t of the Court, to the &s;atisfaction of their Spectators: Be&s;ides, (more for your Diver&s;ion) you may &s;ee not only the two great Play-hou&s;es of the Nation, tho&s;e of the Lords and Commons, in Di&s;pute with one another; but the two other Play-hou&s;es in high Conte&s;t, becau&s;e the Members of one Hou&s;e are remov'd

up to t'other, (as it is often done by the Court for Rea&s;ons of State.) In&s;omuch that the lower Hou&s;es, I mean the Play-hou&s;es, are going to act Tragedies on one another without Doors, and the Sovereign is put to it (as it often happens in the other two Hou&s;es) to &s;ilence one or both, to keep Peace between them: Now I have told you all the News of the Town.</P>

<P>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with my Paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <HI>Mi&s;cellany</HI> of <HI>Bern. Lintot</HI>'s, and in the pre&s;ent Edition of the Po&s;thumous Works of Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI></NOTE> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> corrected. I own you have made more of it by making it le&s;s, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;aid to burn half the Spices they bring home to inhance the Price of the remainder, &s;o to be greater Gainers by their Lo&s;s, (which is indeed my Ca&s;e now.) Well; you have prun'd my fading Lawrels of &s;ome &s;uperfluous, &s;aple&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="22">
and dead Branches, to make the remainder live the longer; thus like your Ma&s;ter <HI>Apollo,</HI> you are at once a Poet and a Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town, your good Nature was the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of my confident reque&s;t; but excu&s;e me, I mu&s;t (I &s;ee) &s;ay no more upon this Subject, &s;ince I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with; tho' you have given me &s;ome Encouragement to hope, our Friend&s;hip (tho' young) might be without Shyne&s;s, or criminal Mode&s;ty; for a Friend like a Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not to refu&s;e a Friend's kindne&s;s becau&s;e it is &s;mall or trivial: I have told you (I think) that a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady &s;aid to her poor, po|etical Gallant, that a Queen if &s;he lay with a Groom, would expect a Mark of his kindne&s;s from him, tho' it were but his Curry-comb. But you and I will di&s;pute this Matter when I am &s;o happy as to &s;ee you here; and perhaps 'tis the only Di&s;|pute in which I might hope to have the better of you.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, to make you another Excu&s;e for my boldne&s;s in inviting you to Town, I de&s;ign'd to leave with you &s;ome more of my Papers, (&s;ince the&s;e return &s;o much bet|ter out of your Hands than they went from mine) for I intended (as I told you formerly)
<PB N="17" REF="23">
to &s;pend a Month, or &s;ix Weeks this Sum|mer, near you in the Country, for you may be a&s;&s;ured there is nothing I de&s;ire &s;o much, as an Improvement of your Friend&s;hip,&mdash;</P>

<P>BY yours of the la&s;t Month, you de&s;ire me to &s;elect, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome Things from the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed in <HI>Folio,</HI> in the Year 1704.</NOTE> fir&s;t Volume of your Mi&s;cel|lanies, which may be alter'd &s;o as to ap|pear again.

For tho' (upon reading 'em on this occa&s;ion) I believe they might receive &s;uch an Alteration with Advantage; yet they would not be chang'd &s;o much, but any one would know 'em for the &s;ame at fir&s;t &s;ight. Or if you mean to improve the wor&s;t Pieces, which are &s;uch as to render them very good, would require a great addition, and almo&s;t the entire new writing of them? Or, la&s;tly, if you mean the middle &s;ort, as the Songs and Love-Ver&s;es? For the&s;e will need only to be &s;hortned, to omit repetition; the Words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know
<PB N="19" REF="25" MS="y">
your mind in this, for I am utterly at a lo&s;s.

I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them: Some I have con|tracted, as we do Sun-beams, to improve their Energy and Force; &s;ome I have ta|ken quite away, as we take Branches from a Tree, to add to the Fruit; others I have entirely new expre&s;s'd, and turned more into Poetry. <HI>Donne</HI> (like one of his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors) had infinitely more Wit than he wanted Ver&s;ification: for the great dealers

<P>I HAVE received yours of the 26th, as kind as it is ingenious, for which therefore I mo&s;t heartily thank you: It would have been much more welcome to me, had it not inform'd me of your want of Health: But you who have a Mind &s;o

<P>I Receiv'd yours of the 9th ye&s;terday, which has (like the re&s;t of your Let|ters) at once pleas'd and in&s;tructed me; &s;o that I a&s;&s;ure you, you can no more write too much to your ab&s;ent Friends, than &s;peak too much to the pre&s;ent.

<P>MR. <HI>Engiefyld</HI> being upon his Journey to <HI>London,</HI> tells me I mu&s;t write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his de&s;ire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it &s;o lately by the Me&s;|&s;enger you &s;ent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of &s;ending you the fair Copy of the <HI>Poem</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Hand, is in the <HI>Harley-Library,</HI> among other &s;uch <HI>Bro&uuml;illons</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley</HI>'s Poems, corrected by him. <HI>Vid. Lett.</HI> Ap. 10, 1705/6. <HI>Note</HI> (a).</NOTE> on <HI>Dulne&s;s,</HI> which was not then fini&s;h'd, and which I &s;hould not care to hazard by the common Po&s;t. Mr. <HI>Englefyld</HI> is ignorant of the Contents, and I hope your prudence will let him re|main &s;o, for my &s;ake no le&s;s than your own: Since if you &s;hould reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder Re|ports &s;hould be rais'd, and there are tho&s;e (I fear) who would be ready to improve them to my di&s;advantage. I am &s;orry you told the great Man, whom you met in the <HI>Court of Reque&s;ts,</HI> that your Papers were in my hands: No Man alive &s;hall ever know any &s;uch thing from me; and
<PB N="25" REF="31">
I give you this warning be&s;ides, that tho' your &s;elf &s;hould &s;ay I had any way a&s;|&s;i&s;ted you, I am notwith&s;tanding re&s;olv'd to deny it.</P>
<P>The method of the Copy I &s;end you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I de&s;ire you to compare it by the <HI>Figures</HI> in the Margin, an&s;wer|ing to the &s;ame in this Letter. The Poem is now divided into four Parts, mark'd with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The fir&s;t contains the <HI>prai&s;e</HI> of Dulne&s;s, and &s;hews how upon &s;everal &s;uppo&s;itions, it pa&s;&s;es for 1. Religion. 2. Philo&s;ophy. 3. Example. 4. Wit. And 5. The cau&s;e of Wit, and the end of it. The &s;econd Part contains the <HI>advantages</HI> of Dulne&s;s: 1&s;t, In Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and 2dly, at Court; where the Si|militudes of the Bya&s;s of a Bowl, and the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend|ing to illu&s;trate tho&s;e advantages of Dul|ne&s;s, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them; (which was your only objection to my ad|ding them.) The third contains the <HI>happi|ne&s;s</HI> of Dulne&s;s in all Stations, and &s;hews in a great many Particulars, that it is &s;o fortunate, as to be e&s;teem'd &s;ome good Quality or other in all &s;orts of People; that it is thought Quiet, Sen&s;e, Caution,
<PB N="26" REF="32">
Policy, Prudence, Maje&s;ty, Valour, Cir|cum&s;pection, Hone&s;ty, &amp;c. The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which &s;ums up all the <HI>prai&s;e, advantage,</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of Dulne&s;s in a few words, and &s;trengthens them all by the oppo&s;ition of the <HI>di&s;grace, di&s;advantage,</HI> and <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> of Wit, with which it concludes <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the pre&s;ent Edition: Some of the Lines in the H.

<Q><L>Thus Dulne&s;s, the &s;afe Opiate of the Mind,</L>

<P>Tho' the whole be as &s;hort again as at fir&s;t, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of &s;omething in your fir&s;t Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they &s;eem'd encompa&s;s'd with too many words; and &s;ome new expre&s;s'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll &s;ee parti|culary in the Simile of the <HI>Clock-Weights;</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>It was originally thus expre&s;s'd: <Q>As Clocks run fa&s;te&s;t when mo&s;t Lead is on.</Q> We find it &s;o in a Letter of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Ver&s;es of his, <HI>To the Author of a Poem call'd Succe&s;&s;io,</HI> which got out in a Mi&s;cellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> died, and two after he had laid a&s;ide the whole de&s;ign of publi&s;hing any Poems.</P></NOTE>

<P>Now as to your Excu&s;e for the plain|ne&s;s of your Stile, or Letter, I mu&s;t needs tell you, that Friend&s;hip is much more ac|ceptable to a true Friend than Wit, which is generally fal&s;e Rea&s;oning; and a Friend's reprimand often &s;hews more Friend&s;hip than his compliment: Nay Love, which is more than Friend&s;hip, is often &s;een, by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes.

her &s;ons with as much of their own, as is nece&s;&s;ary for their Satisfaction.

&s;ince by pre&s;erving his Life he can only make him live about three&s;core or four|&s;core Years; but by pre&s;erving his Reputa|tion, he can make him live as long as the World la&s;ts; &s;o &s;ave him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <HI>Newgate,</HI> to &s;ave them from condemnation by the Publick.

I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding your compliment, which &s;ays, you take the trou|ble kindly: Such is the genero&s;ity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de|&s;ired by them to do them a kindne&s;s; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them.

<P>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and &s;hall be very glad of the continuance of a corre&s;pondence by which I am like to be &s;o great a gainer. I hope when I have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you again in <HI>London,</HI> not only to read over the Ver&s;es I have now of yours, but more that you have written &s;ince; for I make no doubt but any one who writes &s;o well, mu&s;t write more. Not that I think the mo&s;t voluminous Poets al|ways the be&s;t, I believe the contrary is ra|ther true. I mention'd &s;omewhat to you in <HI>London</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;toral Comedy,</HI> which I &s;hould be glad to hear you had thought upon &s;ince. I find <HI>Menage</HI> in his ob&s;erva|tions upon <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s <HI>Aminta,</HI> reckons up four|&s;core Pa&s;toral Plays in <HI>Italian:</HI> And in look|ing over my old <HI>Italian</HI> Books, I find a great many Pa&s;torals and Pi&s;catory Plays, which I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Menage</HI> reckons together. I find al&s;o by <HI>Menage,</HI> that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> is not the fir&s;t that writ in that kind, he mentioning an|other before him, which he him&s;elf had never &s;een, nor indeed have I. But as the <HI>Aminta, Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> and <HI>Filli di Sciro</HI> of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> are the three be&s;t, &s;o I think there
<PB N="58" REF="63">
is no di&s;pute but <HI>Aminta</HI> is the be&s;t of the three: Not but that the Di&s;cour&s;es in <HI>Pa|&s;tor Fido</HI> are more entertaining and copious in &s;everal peoples opinion, tho' not &s;o pro|per for Pa&s;toral; and the Fable of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> more &s;urprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Racan</HI>'s <HI>Bergeries</HI> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are all too full of Conceits. <HI>Rapin</HI> will have the de&s;ign of Pa&s;toral Plays to be taken from the <HI>Cyclops</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI> I am &s;ure there is nothing of this kind in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your &s;elf.

<P>I Cannot omit the fir&s;t opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing tho&s;e Papers of mine. You have no le&s;s right to correct me, than the &s;ame hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<PB N="59" REF="64">
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint|ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an|other, till they &s;tiffen and deaden the Piece. Be&s;ides to be&s;tow heightning on every part is mon&s;trous: Some parts ought to be lower than the re&s;t; and nothing looks more ri|diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, &s;eem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <HI>Weeds, Gra&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> are all laid even, and appear undi&s;tingui&s;h'd. I believe too that &s;ometimes our fir&s;t Thoughts are the be&s;t, as the fir&s;t &s;queez|ing of the Grapes makes the fine&s;t and riche&s;t Wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of Pa&s;to|ral Comedy, becau&s;e I think the Ta&s;te of our Age will not reli&s;h a Poem of that &s;ort. People &s;eek for what they call <HI>Wit,</HI> on all &s;ubjects, and in all places; not con&s;i|dering that Nature loves Truth &s;o well, that it hardly ever admits of flouri&s;hing: <HI>Con|ceit</HI> is to Nature what <HI>Paint</HI> is to Beauty; it is not only needle&s;s, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Maje&s;ty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintne&s;s of Wit: in&s;omuch that the Cri|tics have excluded it from the loftie&s;t Poet|ry, as well as the lowe&s;t, and forbid it to the Epic no le&s;s than the Pa&s;toral. I &s;hou'd certainly di&s;plea&s;e all tho&s;e who are charm'd
<PB N="60" REF="65">
with <HI>Guarini</HI> and <HI>Bonarelli,</HI> and imitate <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <HI>Fable</HI> too. If &s;urpri|&s;ing di&s;coveries &s;hou'd have place in the &s;tory of a Pa&s;toral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <HI>Chance</HI> than of <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> Intrigue not being very con|&s;i&s;tent with that Innocence, which ought to con&s;titute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <HI>Aminta</HI> (as I re|member) but happens by meer accident; unle&s;s it be the meeting of <HI>Aminta</HI> with <HI>Syl|via</HI> at the <HI>Fountain,</HI> which is the contrivance of <HI>Daphne,</HI> and even that is the mo&s;t &s;imple in the world: The contrary is ob&s;ervable in <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> where <HI>Cori&s;ca</HI> is &s;o perfect a Mi&s;tre&s;s of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to pa&s;s without her. I am inclin'd to think the Pa&s;toral Come|dy has another di&s;advantage, as to the <HI>Man|ners:</HI> Its general de&s;ign is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, &s;o that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara|cter mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure deba&s;e it; and hence it may come to pa&s;s, that even the virtuous Characters will not &s;hine &s;o much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra|ries.&mdash;The&s;e Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have rea&s;on to doubt
<PB N="61" REF="66">
them: but I hope your Judgment will &s;et me right.</P>
<P>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an|other point: It is how far the liberty of <HI>Borrowing</HI> may extend? I have defended it &s;ometimes by &s;aying, that it &s;eems not &s;o much the Perfection of Sen&s;e, to &s;ay things that have <HI>never</HI> been &s;aid before, as to ex|pre&s;s tho&s;e <HI>be&s;t</HI> that have been &s;aid <HI>oftene&s;t;</HI> and that Writers in the ca&s;e of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them|&s;elves wou'd produce only one &s;ort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flouri&s;h; but then Poets like Mer|chants, &s;hou'd repay with &s;omething of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de|&s;ire you to tell me &s;incerely, if I have not &s;tretch'd this Licence too far in the&s;e Pa|&s;torals? I hope to become a Critic by your Precepts, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have &s;een your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, &s;o long as you give me leave to profe&s;s my &s;elf</P>

<P>I Had &s;ooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the &s;ame time of my Journey to <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en|gag'd to go to my Corporation of <HI>Rich|mond</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> I think you are per|fectly in the right in your Notions of Pa&s;toral, but I am of opinion, that the re|dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what plea&s;es the common people, is not what ever plea&s;es the be&s;t judges. <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido</HI> indeed has had more admirers than <HI>Aminta;</HI> but I will venture to &s;ay, there is a great deal of difference between the admi|rers of one and the other. <HI>Cori&s;ca,</HI> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pa&s;toral; and <HI>Bo|narelli</HI>'s fancy of making his Shepherde&s;s in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Borrowing;</HI> 'tis very evident the be&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have extended this very far; and none &s;o far as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who is the be&s;t
<PB N="63" REF="68">
of them. As for the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, if we cannot trace them &s;o plainly, 'tis perhaps becau&s;e we have none before them; 'tis evi|dent that mo&s;t of them borrow'd from <HI>Ho|mer,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> has been accus'd of burn|ing tho&s;e that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be di&s;cover'd. The be&s;t of the modern Poets in all Languages, are tho&s;e that have the neare&s;t copied the An|cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are &s;o obvious (at lea&s;t if they are natural) that whoever writes la&s;t, mu&s;t write things like what have been &s;aid before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat|ing and drinking, and accu&s;e the Moderns of having &s;tol'n tho&s;e Inventions from them; it being evident in all &s;uch ca&s;es, that whoever live fir&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q><L>&mdash;unus &amp; alter A&s;&s;uitur pannus,</L></Q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts &s;tol'n, and all the re&s;t is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very fooli&s;h figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Ancients &s;o mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can di&s;tin|gui&s;h the one from the other, I can never
<PB N="64" REF="69">
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif|ferent opinion, and that I have &s;hewn your Ver&s;es to &s;ome who have made that obje|ction to them. I have &s;o much Company round me while I write this, and &s;uch a noi&s;e in my ears, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould write any thing but Non&s;en&s;e, &s;o mu&s;t break off abruptly.</P>

<P>AT my return from the North I re|ceiv'd the favour of your Letter, which had lain there till then. Having been ab&s;ent about &s;ix weeks, I read over your Pa&s;torals again, with a great deal of plea&s;ure, and to judge the better read <HI>Vir|gil</HI>'s Eclogues, and <HI>Spen&s;er</HI>'s Calendar, at the &s;ame time; and I a&s;&s;ure you I continue the &s;ame opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa|&s;ions to improve them, 'tis probable you
<PB N="65" REF="70">
will make them yet better again&s;t Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Ver&s;es till he takes away the true Spirit of them; e&s;pecially if he &s;ubmits to the correction of &s;ome who pa&s;s for great Critics, by me|chanical Rules, and never enter into the true De&s;ign and Genius of an Author. I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <HI>Horace,</HI> who cry <HI>Virgil</HI> wants fancy, and that <HI>Homer</HI> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com|mon rate of mortals: but generally they are great admirers of <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Lucan;</HI> and when they write them&s;elves, we find out all the My&s;tery. They &s;can their Ver&s;es upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the fir&s;t may be la&s;t, or the la&s;t fir&s;t, without any &s;ort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no De&s;ign, or Method, or any thing Natural or Ju&s;t. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings what&s;oever (not Poetry only) <HI>Nature</HI> is to be follow'd; and we &s;hou'd be jealous of our &s;elves for being fond of <HI>Similies, Conceits,</HI> and what they call &s;aying <HI>Fine Things.</HI> When we were in the North, my Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> &s;hew'd
<PB N="66" REF="71">
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of <HI>P.</HI></NOTE> General in <HI>Spain;</HI> I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd, and &s;et to writing here at home, for it was im|po&s;&s;ible that a Man with &s;o much Wit as he &s;hew'd, cou'd be fit to command an Army, or do any other Bu&s;ine&s;s. As for what you &s;ay of Expre&s;&s;ion: 'tis indeed the &s;ame thing to Wit, as Dre&s;s is to Beau|ty; I have &s;een many Women over-dre&s;t, and &s;everal look better in a carele&s;s Night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoi&s;elle <HI>Spanheim</HI> dre&s;t for a Ball.

<P N="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve|ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of.

As in de|&s;cribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers &s;hou'd run ea&s;y and flowing; in de&s;cribing a rough Torrent or Deluge, &s;onorous and &s;wel|ling,
<PB N="66" REF="73">
and &s;o of the re&s;t. This is evident every where in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and no where el&s;e that I know of to any ob&s;ervable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <HI>Vida.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Molle viam tacito lap&s;u per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine &s;ub&s;idendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempe&s;tate&s;que &s;onoras.</L>
<L>Immen&s;o cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle &s;ine ictu, Conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape &s;axa manu, cape robora Pa&s;tor,</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite pe&s;tem.</L></Q>
<P>This, I think, is what very few ob&s;erve in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder|ful force in imprinting the Image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ode on St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day, entitled, <HI>Alexander</HI>'s <HI>Fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Every nice Ear, mu&s;t (I believe) have ob&s;erv'd, that in any &s;mooth <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e of ten &s;yllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pau&s;e</HI> at the fourth, fifth, or &s;ixth &s;yllable. It is
<PB N="67" REF="74">
upon the&s;e the Ear re&s;ts, and upon the ju|dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Ver&s;ification. For example,</P>
<Q><L><HI>At the fifth.</HI> Where-e'er thy Navy &Verbar; &s;preads her canva&s;s Wings,</L>
<L><HI>At the fourth.</HI> Homage to thee &Verbar; and Peace to all &s;he brings.</L>
<L><HI>At the &s;ixth.</HI> Like Tracts of Leverets &Verbar; in Morning Snow.</L></Q>
<P>Now I fancy, that to pre&s;erve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pau&s;es of the 4th or 6th &s;hou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo|&s;ition of another; el&s;e it will be apt to wea|ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at lea&s;t it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite &s;o dead a weight, &s;o tires not &s;o much tho' it be continued longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <HI>Exple|tives,</HI> whether Words or Syllables, which are made u&s;e of purely to &s;upply a vacan|cy: <HI>Do</HI> before Verbs plural is ab&s;olutely &s;uch; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the &s;ame manner, which are almo&s;t always
<PB N="68" REF="75">
u&s;ed for the &s;ake of Rhime. The &s;ame Cau&s;e has occa&s;ioned the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to the &s;ame Per&s;on, which can never &s;ound &s;o graceful as either one or the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would al&s;o object to the Irruption of <HI>Alexandrine</HI> Ver&s;es of twelve &s;yllables, which I think &s;hould never be allow'd but when &s;ome remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has been too free of the&s;e, e&s;pecially in his latter Works. I am of the &s;ame opinion as to <HI>Triple Rhimes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. I could equally object to the <HI>Repetition</HI> of the &s;ame Rhimes within four or &s;ix lines of each other, as tire&s;ome to the Ear thro' their Monotony.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Mono&s;yllable-Lines,</HI> unle&s;s very artfully managed, are &s;tiff, or langui&s;hing: but may be beautiful to expre&s;s Melancholy, Slow|ne&s;s, or Labour.</P>
<P N="7">7. To come to the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> or Gap be|tween two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other (upon which you de&s;ire me to be particular) I think the rule in this ca&s;e is either to u&s;e the <HI>Cae&s;ura,</HI> or admit the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> ju&s;t as the Ear is lea&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="76">
&s;hock'd by either: For the <HI>Cae&s;ura</HI> &s;ome|times offends the Ear more than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> it&s;elf, and our language is naturally over|charg'd with Con&s;onants: As for example; If in this Ver&s;e,
<Q><L>The Old have Int're&s;t ever in their Eye,</L></Q>
we &s;hould &s;ay, to avoid the <HI>Hiatus,</HI>
<Q><L>But th' Old have Int're&s;t&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Hiatus</HI> which has the wor&s;t effect, is when one word ends with the &s;ame Vowel that begins the following; and next to this, tho&s;e Vowels who&s;e &s;ounds come neare&s;t to each other are mo&s;t to be avoid|ed. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know &s;ome people will think the&s;e Ob&s;ervations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro|borate them by &s;ome great Authorities, which I have met with in <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quin|tilian.</HI> In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to <HI>Herennius,</HI> are the&s;e words: <HI>Fugiemus cre|bras Vocalium concur&s;iones, quae va&s;tam at|que hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc e&s;t, Baccae aeneae amaeni&s;&s;imae impendebant.</HI> And Quintilian <HI>l.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Vocalium concur&s;us cum accidit, hiat &amp; inter&s;i&s;tit, at qua&s;i la|borat oratio. Pe&s;&s;imi long&egrave; quae ea&s;dem inter</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="77">
<HI>&s;e literas committunt, &s;onabunt: Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efferuntur. E plenior litera e&s;t, I angu|&s;tior.</HI> But he goes on to reprove the ex|ce&s;s on the other hand of being too &s;ol|licitous in this matter, and &s;ays admirably, <HI>Ne&s;cio an negligentia in hoc, aut &s;olicitudo &s;it pejor.</HI> So likewi&s;e <HI>Tully (Orator ad Brut.) Theopompum reprehendunt, quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, et&s;i idem magi&s;ter ejus I&s;ocrates:</HI> which la&s;t Author, as <HI>Turnebus</HI> on <HI>Quintilian</HI> ob&s;erve, has hardly one <HI>Hia|tus</HI> in all his Works. <HI>Quintilian</HI> tells us that <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> did not much ob&s;erve this Nicety, tho' <HI>Tully</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays in his Orator, <HI>Crebra i&s;ta Vocum concur&s;io, quam magna ex parte vitio&s;am, fugit Demo&s;thenes.</HI> If I am not mi&s;taken, <HI>Malherbe</HI> of all the Moderns has been the mo&s;t &s;crupulous in this point; and I think <HI>Menage</HI> in his Ob|&s;ervations upon him &s;ays, he has not one in his Poems. To conclude, I believe the <HI>Hi|tus</HI> &s;hould be avoided with more care in Poetry than in Oratory; and I would con|&s;tantly try to prevent it, unle&s;s where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the Sound than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> it&s;elf.

<P>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World, who&s;e lo&s;s it &s;elf they do not &s;o much re|gret, as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it.

will expect I &s;hould recant this Expre&s;&s;ion, when I tell you, that <HI>Sapho</HI> (by which hea|theni&s;h Name you have chri&s;ten'd a very orthodox Lady) did not accompany me in|to the Country. However, I will confe&s;s my &s;elf the le&s;s concern'd on that account, becau&s;e I have no very violent Inclination to lo&s;e my Heart, e&s;pecially in &s;o wild and &s;avag&egrave; a place as this Fore&s;t is: In the Town, 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his &s;tray'd Heart again, with &s;ome <HI>Wild|&s;treet</HI> or <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Dam&s;el; but here, where I could have met with no redre&s;s from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I mu&s;t for ever hav&eacute; lo&s;t my little Traveller in a Hole, where I cou'd never rummage to find him again.&mdash;Well, Sir, you have your Lady in the Town &s;till, and I have my Heart in the Country &s;till, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more room in it for my Friends, and does not want a Corner at your Service.&mdash;To be &s;erious, you have extreamly oblig'd me by your. Frankne&s;s and Kindne&s;s to me: And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part, I hope you will at|tribute it to the natural Openne&s;s of my Temper, which hardly knows how to &s;how Re&s;pect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd love my Friend, as my Mi&s;tre&s;s, without Ceremony; and hope a little rough U&s;age

<P>If you have any Curio&s;ity to know in what manner I live, or rather lo&s;e a Life, <HI>Martial</HI> will inform you in one Line: (the Tran&s;lation of which co&s;t a Friend of ours three in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI></P>

<P>YOU talk of Fame and Glory, and of the great Men of Antiquity: Pray tell me, what are all your great dead Men, but &s;o many little living Letters? What a va&s;t Reward is here for all the Ink wa&s;ted by Writers, and all the Blood &s;pilt by Princes? There was in old time one <HI>Severus</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor.

<P>I Have been &s;o well &s;atisfy'd with the Country ever &s;ince I &s;aw you, that I have not &s;o much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it be&s;ides Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and your &s;elf. And from him I under&s;tand of your Journey this Sum|mer into <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> from whence I gue&s;s you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Bu&s;ine&s;s of comparing Critics, and re|conciling
<PB N="81" REF="86">
commentators; and to the old di|ver&s;ions of a lo&s;ing game at picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Hearing.</NOTE> Sen&s;e which there for the mo&s;t part could only &s;erve to di&s;gu&s;t you, enjoy the vigour of another which ravi&s;hes you.
<Q><L>You know, when one Sen&s;e is &s;uppre&s;t,</L>
<L>It but retires into the re&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>(According to the poetical, not the learn|ed, <HI>Dodwell;</HI> who has done one thing wor|thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not non&s;en&s;e!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the boxes, without being trou|bled with any of the dulne&s;s of the &s;tage. You are &s;o good a critic, that 'tis the great|e&s;t happine&s;s of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not &s;o arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the re&s;t) without hearing. But now I talk of tho&s;e critics, I have good news to tell you concerning my &s;elf, for which I expect you &s;hou'd congratulate with me: It is that beyond all my expectations, and
<PB N="82" REF="87">
far above my demerits, I have been mo&s;t mercifully repriev'd by the fovereign power of <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on,</HI> from being brought forth to publick puni&s;hment; and re&s;pited from time to time from the hands of tho&s;e bar|barous executioners of the Mu&s;es, whom I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver them&s;elves into the hands of Ju|&s;tice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their di&s;advantage; and not out of any Ambition to &s;pread their fame, by be|ing executed in the face of the world, which is a &s;ame but of &s;hort continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to pre&s;erve his for ninety-nine years; for tho&s;e names very rarely la&s;t &s;o many days, which are planted either in <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on</HI>'s, or the <HI>Ordinary of Newgate</HI>'s Mi&s;cellanies.</P>
<P>I have an hundred things to &s;ay to you, which &s;hall be deferr'd till I have the hap|pine&s;s of &s;eeing you in town, for the &s;ea|&s;on now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had commu|nicated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain where you pa&s;s'd your time the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on: So much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the plea&s;ure you cou'd de&s;ire from the coun|try,
<PB N="83" REF="88">
and your own thoughts the be&s;t com|pany in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> to our Fore&s;t, he continu'd (as you told me long &s;ince he wou'd) an ob|&s;tinate lover of the town, in &s;pite of friend|&s;hip and fair weather. Therefore hence|forward, to all tho&s;e con&s;iderable qualities I know you po&s;&s;e&s;t of, I &s;hall add that of Prophecy. But I &s;till believe Mr. <HI>Wycher|ley</HI>'s intentions were good, and am &s;atisfy'd that he promi&s;es nothing but with a real de&s;ign to perform it: how much &s;oever his other excellent qualities are above my imi|tation, his &s;incerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmo&s;t that I am,</P>

<P>I Had &s;ent you the inclos'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a Tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Statius,</HI> done when the Author was but 14 Years old, as appears by an Ad|verti&s;ement before the fir&s;t Edition of it in a Mi&s;cellany pub|li&s;h'd by <HI>B.

<PB N="84" REF="89">
without &s;u&s;picion of their mi&s;carrying; not, that they are of the lea&s;t value, but for fear &s;ome body might be fooli&s;h enough to imagine them &s;o, and inqui&s;itive enough to di&s;cover tho&s;e faults which I (by your help) wou'd correct. I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber, and to be very free of your re|marks in the margins, not only in regard to the accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran|&s;lation; which I have not had time of late to compare with its original. And I de&s;ire you to be the more &s;evere, as it is much more criminal for me to make another &s;peak non&s;en&s;e, than to do it in my own proper, per&s;on. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire ver&s;ion of the fir&s;t book. There is an omi&s;&s;ion from the 168th line&mdash;<HI>Jam murmura &s;erpunt plebis ageno|reae</HI>&mdash;to the 312th&mdash;<HI>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>&mdash;(between the&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e he &s;ince tran&s;lated, and they are extant in the printed Ver&s;ion.</NOTE> two <HI>Statius</HI> has a de&s;cription of the council of the Gods, and a &s;peech of <HI>Ju|piter;</HI> which contain a peculiar beauty and maje&s;ty, and were left out for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the con&s;equence
<PB N="85" REF="90">
of this machine appears not till the &s;econd book) The tran&s;lation goes on from thence to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam</HI> where there is an odd account of a battle at fifty-cuffs be|tween the two Princes on a very &s;light occa&s;ion, and at a time when one wou'd think the fatigue of their journey in &s;o tem|pe&s;tuous a night, might have render'd them very unfit for &s;uch a &s;cuffle. This I had actually tran&s;lated, but was very ill &s;atis|fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of con&s;cience; it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words&mdash;<HI>Hic pri|mum lu&s;trare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;to the end of the book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt not, that <HI>Sta|tius</HI> was none of the di&s;creete&s;t Poets, tho' he was the be&s;t ver&s;ifier next <HI>Vir|gil:</HI> In the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry, (which <HI>Horace</HI> had already taught the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>) when he asks his Mu&s;e where to begin his <HI>Thebaid,</HI> and &s;eems to doubt whe|ther it &s;hould not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo?</HI> when he comes to the &s;cene of his Poem, and the prize in di&s;pute between the Brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it&mdash;
<PB N="86" REF="91">
<HI>Pugna e&s;t de paupere regno.</HI>&mdash;Very diffe|rent from the conduct of his ma&s;ter <HI>Virgil,</HI> who at the entrance of his Poem informs his reader of the greatne&s;s of its &s;ub|ject,&mdash;<HI>Tantoe molis erat Romanam condere Gentem.</HI> [Bo&s;&s;u <HI>on Epic Poetry.</HI>] There are innumerable little faults in him, a|mong which I cannot but take notice of one in this book, where &s;peaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers, he &s;ays, <HI>The whole world wou'd be too &s;mall a prize to repay &s;o much impiety.</HI><Q><L>Quid &s;i peteretur crimine tanto</L>

<P>YOU had long before this time been troubled with a Letter from me, but that I deferr'd it till I cou'd &s;end you either the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jacob Ton&s;on</HI>'s &s;ixth Volume of Poetical Mi&s;cellanies, in which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Pa&s;torals and &s;ome Ver&s;ions of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Chaucer</HI> were fir&s;t printed.</NOTE> Mi&s;cellany, or my continuation of the Ver&s;ion of <HI>Statius.</HI> The fir&s;t I imagin'd you might have had before now, but &s;ince the contrary has happen'd, you may draw this Moral from it, That Authors in gene|ral are more ready to write non&s;en&s;e, than Book&s;ellers are to publi&s;h it. I had I know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together, in which time all the ver&s;es you &s;ee added, have been written; which I tell you that you may more freely be &s;evere upon them. 'Tis a mercy I do not a&s;&s;ault you with a number of original Sonnets and Epigrams, which our modern Bards put forth in the &s;pring|time, in as great abundance, as Trees do

<P>THE Morning after I parted from you, I found my felf (as I had prophecy'd) all alone, in an unea&s;y Stage-Coach; a dole|ful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the lea&s;t hope of entertainment but from my la&s;t recour&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es, a Book. I then be|gan to enter into acquaintance with the <HI>Morali&s;ts,</HI> and had ju&s;t receiv'd from them
<PB N="95" REF="100">
&s;ome cold con&s;olation for the inconvenien|cies of this life, and the incertainty of hu|man affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to &s;top, and heard from the &s;ide of it the dreadful news of a &s;ick Woman preparing to enter it. 'Tis not ea&s;y to gue&s;s at my mortification, but being &s;o well fortify'd with Philo&s;ophy I &s;tood re&s;ign'd with a Stoical con&s;tancy to endure the wor&s;t of evils, a &s;ick Woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dre&s;s, that &s;he was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no &s;ooner was her hood remov'd, but I &s;aw one of the fine&s;t faces I ever beheld, and to increa&s;e my &s;urprize, heard her &s;alure me by my name. I never had more rea&s;on to accu&s;e Nature for making me &s;hort-&s;ight|ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever &s;een tho&s;e fair eyes which knew me &s;o well, and was utterly at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s my &s;elf; till with a great deal of &s;implicity and innocence &s;he let me know (even before I di&s;cover'd my ignorance) that &s;he was the daughter of one in our Neigh|bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been con&s;ulting her Phy&s;icians in Town, was re|turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you mu&s;t know, has &s;ometimes recommended the Study of Phy|&s;ick to me, but I never had any ambition
<PB N="96" REF="101">
to be a Doctor till this in&s;tant. I ventur'd to pre&s;cribe &s;ome Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid|den her by her Doctors, &s;he had the more inclination to. In &s;hort, I tempted, and &s;he eat; nor was I more like the Devil than &s;he like <HI>Eve.</HI> Having the good &s;ucce&s;s of the 'fore&s;aid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in &s;pite of my evil Form acco&s;ted her with all the Gaiety I was ma&s;ter of; which had &s;o good effect, that in le&s;s than an hour &s;he grew plea&s;ant, her colour return'd, and &s;he was pleas'd to &s;ay my pre&s;cription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the plea&s;ante&s;t journey imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has &s;ome|thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol|lows as the greate&s;t of truths, That I think my &s;elf extreamly oblig'd by you in all points, e&s;pecially for your kind and ho|nourable Information and Advice in a mat|ter of the utmo&s;t concern to me, which I &s;hall ever acknowledge as the highe&s;t proof at once of your friend&s;hip, ju&s;tice, and &s;in|cerity.

<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en|quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your &s;peculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-hou&s;e, and bidding adieu for &s;ome time to all the <HI>Rehear&s;als, Reviews, Ga|zettes,</HI> &amp;c. have march'd off into <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire.</HI> Thus I find you vary your life in the &s;cene at lea&s;t, tho' not in the Action; for tho' Life for the mo&s;t part, like an old Play, be &s;till the &s;ame, yet now and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining.

merry life, is (if you will excu&s;e &s;uch a &s;i|militude) not unlike a F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t, at once na&s;ty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of the&s;e: every Actor is much better known by his having the &s;ame Face, than by keeping the &s;ame Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was ye&s;terday <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> is to day Sir <HI>John Daw.</HI> So that one might ask the &s;ame que&s;tion of a mo|dern life, that <HI>Rich</HI> did of a modern play; <Q REND="inline">"Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me; Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?"</Q></P>

'Tis extreamly kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an|xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long

&s;ilence. However the love of &s;ome things rewards it&s;elf, as of Vertue, and of Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley.</HI> I am &s;urpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and mu&s;t agree with you, that our nation would have lo&s;t in him alone, more wit, and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the re&s;t of it. My concern for his friend&s;hip will excu&s;e me, (&s;ince I know you honour him &s;o much, and &s;ince you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my unea&s;ine&s;s to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to in&s;inuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I fear may have had &s;ome effect upon him. If &s;o, he will have a grea|ter puni&s;hment for his credulity than I cou'd wi&s;h him, in that fellow's acquain|tance. The lo&s;s of a faithful creature is &s;omething, tho' of ever &s;o contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for &s;uch a Man as the afore&s;aid, I &s;hou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as con&s;tantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a wor&s;e &s;ubject which my &s;pleen tempts me to, I will give you &s;ome account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, &s;ince <HI>Montaigne</HI> (to whom I am but a Dog

He is not much a Spa|niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb &s;urly &s;ort of kindne&s;s, that rather &s;hows it&s;elf when he thinks me ill|us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by our &s;elves. If it be the chief point of Friend&s;hip to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I &s;it, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witne&s;s our Walk a year ago in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park.&mdash;Hi&s;tories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not in&s;i&s;t upon ma|ny of 'em, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome may be almo&s;t as fabulous as tho&s;e of <HI>Pylades</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I Am glad to find by your la&s;t letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend, &s;etting down your thoughts as they occur, and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own Trifles, which I a&s;&s;ure you I never valu'd half &s;o much as I do that Sincerity in you which they were the occa|&s;ion of di&s;covering to me; and which while I am happy in, I may be tru&s;ted with that dangerous weapon, Poetry; &s;ince I &s;hall do
<PB N="132" REF="135">
nothing with it but after asking and fol|lowing your advice. I value Sincerity the more, as I find by &s;ad experience, the pra|cti&s;e of it is more dangerous; Writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their ver&s;es, ev'n tho' them&s;elves pronounce &s;entence up|on them.&mdash;As to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI>'s Pa&s;torals, I take the fir&s;t to be infinitely the be&s;t, and the &s;econd the wor&s;t; the third is for the greate&s;t part a Tran&s;lation from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Daphnis.</HI> I will not fore&s;tal your judgment of the re&s;t, only ob&s;erve in that of the Nightingale the&s;e lines, (&s;peaking of the Mu&s;ician's playing on the harp.)<Q><L>Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they pa&s;s,</L>

<P>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for Pa&s;toral, e&s;pe|cially being put into the mouth of a Shep|herd, as they are here; in the Poet's own per&s;on they had heen (I believe) more pro|per. The&s;e are more after <HI>Virgil</HI>'s manner than that of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> whom yet in the character of Pa&s;toral he rather &s;eems to
<PB N="133" REF="136">
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <HI>Tatler,</HI> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a &s;mall copy of the &s;ame Author publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Tatler</HI> N^o 12. on the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint|ing, and I recommend it to your per|u&s;al.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Garth</HI>'s Poem I have not &s;een, but believe I &s;hall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <HI>Will</HI>'s, who &s;wore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of &s;wear|ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more &s;afely when they commend, than when they blame.</P>
<P>I agree with you in your cen&s;ure of the u&s;e of <HI>Sea-terms</HI> in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil;</HI> not only becau&s;e <HI>Helenus</HI> was no great Pro|phet in tho&s;e matters, but becau&s;e no Terms of Art or Cant-Words &s;uit with the Ma|je&s;ty and dignity of Stile which <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry requires.&mdash;<HI>Cui mens divinior atque os magna &s;oniturum.</HI>&mdash;The Tarpawlin Phra&s;e can plea&s;e none but &s;uch <HI>Qui Aurem habent Batavam;</HI> they mu&s;t not expect <HI>Au|ribus Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phra&s;es of <HI>Martial</HI> here very dextrou&s;ly.)</P>
<P>Tho' you &s;ay you did not rightly take my Meaning in the ver&s;e I quoted from <HI>Juve|nal,</HI> yet I will not explain it; becau&s;e tho' it &s;eems you are re&s;olv'd to take me for a

<P>I hope it will be no offence to give my mo&s;t hearty &s;ervice to Mr. <HI>Wycherly,</HI> tho' I perceive by his la&s;t to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, &s;ince he there told me he was going in&s;tantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser|vant, &amp;c. I gue&s;s by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, a&s;|&s;ure him I have ever borne all the Re|&s;pect and Kindne&s;s imaginable to him.

I cou'd not have thought any man had been &s;o very cautious and &s;u&s;picious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to be|lieve no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not &s;o much of Hone&s;ty. There is but one way I know of conver&s;ing &s;afely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we &s;ay or do, but by &s;aying or doing nothing that de&s;erves to be conceal'd, and I can truly boa&s;t this comfort in my affairs

<P>IT &s;eems that my late mention of <HI>Cra|&s;haw,</HI> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curio&s;ity. I therefore &s;end you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for &s;ome years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of tho&s;e who&s;e works may ju&s;t de&s;erve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at lei&s;ure hours, and more to keep out of idlene&s;s, than to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a reputation: &s;o that nothing regular or ju&s;t can be expected from him. All that regards De&s;ign, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex|actne&s;s, or con&s;ent of parts, (which is the
<PB N="146" REF="149">
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret|ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;omething of a neat ca&s;t of Ver&s;e, (which are properly the dre&s;s, gems, or loo&s;e ornaments of Poetry) may be found in the&s;e ver&s;es. This is indeed the ca&s;e of mo&s;t other Poetical Writers of <HI>Mi&s;cellanies;</HI> nor can it well be otherwi&s;e, &s;ince no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diver&s;ion only. The&s;e Authors &s;hou'd be con&s;ider'd as <HI>Ver&s;ifiers</HI> and <HI>witty Men,</HI> rather than as <HI>Poets;</HI> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expre&s;&s;ion, and the Numbers. The&s;e are only the plea&s;ing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to expre&s;s my &s;elf like a Painter) their <HI>Colouring</HI> entertains the &s;ight, but the <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of the Picture are not to be in|&s;pected too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd him&s;elf upon <HI>Pe|trarch,</HI> or rather upon <HI>Marino.</HI> His thoughts one may ob&s;erve, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often &s;train'd and &s;tiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never &s;o apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and incon&s;iderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than under&s;tood. This ambition of &s;urpri&s;ing a reader, is the true natural cau&s;e of all Fu&s;tian, or Bomba&s;t in
<PB N="147" REF="150">
Poetry. To confirm what I have &s;aid you need but look into his fir&s;t Poem of the <HI>Weeper,</HI> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21&s;t &s;tanza's are as &s;ublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d &s;tanza's of the &s;ame copy, are &s;oft and plea|&s;ing: And if the&s;e la&s;t want any thing, it is an ea&s;ier and more unaffected expre&s;&s;ion. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been &s;pared, being either but re|petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the fir&s;t one may gue&s;s at all the re&s;t; to be like this, a mixture of tender gentile thoughts and &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions, of forc'd and inextri|cable conceits, and of needle&s;s fillers-up to the re&s;t. From all which it is plain, this Author writ fa&s;t, and &s;et down what came uppermo&s;t. A reader may skim off the froth, and u&s;e the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot|tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <HI>own, natural, middle-way,</HI> is be&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of his <HI>Numbers</HI> is a little diffi|cult, they are &s;o various and irregular, and mo&s;tly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Ver&s;e (the be&s;t example of which is his <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI>'s <HI>Duel</HI>) is carele&s;ly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<PB N="148" REF="151">
that had he taken more care, it had been mu&s;ical and plea&s;ing enough, not extream|ly maje&s;tic, but &s;weet: And the time con|&s;ider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un|correct as he is) none of the wor&s;t Ver&s;ifi|cators.</P>
<P>I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the be&s;t Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphra&s;e on P&s;al. 23. On <HI>Le&s;&s;ius,</HI> Epitaph on Mr. <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> Wi&s;hes to his &s;uppos'd Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

As the fooling and toying with a mi&s;tre&s;s is a proof of fondne&s;s, not di&s;re&s;pect, &s;o is raillery with a friend.

<P>IT is too much a rule in this town, that when a Lady has once done a man a favour, he is to be rude to her ever after.

Thirdly, becau&s;e you have nothing to do but to write if you plea&s;e, and po&s;&s;ibly it may keep you from em|ploying your &s;elf wor&s;e: it may &s;ave &s;ome hone&s;t neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your pe&s;tilent glances. Ca&s;t your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are &s;educing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's &s;often you, and the godly one's give you the &s;pleen: If you look upon trees, they cla&s;p in em|braces; birds and bea&s;ts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yeilding and melancholy. Therefore I &s;ay once more, ca&s;t your eyes upon Paper, and read only &s;uch Letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from Innocence of &s;oul, and &s;implicity of heart. However, I can al|low you a Bonnet lined with green for your eyes, but take care you don't tarni&s;h it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that hand you &s;hade your &s;elf with this &s;hining weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with being carried over tho&s;e Eyes&mdash;thank God I am an hundred miles off from them&mdash;

<P>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to &s;hew her the regard we have for another; and yet I mu&s;t own there is not a period of this Epi&s;tle but &s;quints toward another over|again&s;t it.

few proficients have a greater genius for Mon&s;ters than my &s;elf; but I never ta&s;ted a mon&s;ter to that degree I have done this creature: It was not, like other mon&s;ters, produced in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> nor came from the country of the <HI>Great Mo|gul,</HI> but is the production of the joint-en|deavours of a <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Par&s;on and his Spou&s;e, who intended in the &s;inglene&s;s of heart to have begot a chri&s;tian but of one &s;ex, and providence has &s;ent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning this Creature about town, Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> ob&s;erves that the Age is very licentious, and the pre&s;ent Reign very lewd and cor|rupt, in permitting a Lady <HI>by Authority</HI> (as appears by the printed bills) to expo&s;e her per&s;onal curio&s;ities for a &s;hilling.</P>

Mrs. <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> admires what people won|der at &s;o much? and &s;ays &s;he is ju&s;t &s;o her &s;elf: The Duche&s;s of <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> is of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phy&s;ician and a Divine, the one to in&s;pect the &s;tate of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The per&s;ons I made choice of were the in|genious Dr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> and the reverend Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> We were no &s;ooner in the room but the Party came to us dre&s;t in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi|tical imitation of Men&mdash;your &s;harp wit, my dear Si&s;ter, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my &s;elf look'd fir&s;t. The Prie&s;t you will ma|liciou&s;ly fancy was in his nature mo&s;t an Infidel, and doubted mo&s;t of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the &s;ure&s;t method of believing, &s;eeing and feel|ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of &s;nuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we &s;hould by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by &s;o doing we &s;hould be guilty of le&s;s &s;infulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="173">
The Doctor upon in&s;pection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at mo&s;t a natural one: He &s;aid upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwi&s;e, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a mo&s;t even di&s;po&s;ition, par|taking of the good qualities of both &s;exes: for &s;he is neither &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible as other Ladies, nor is he &s;o impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com|plai&s;ant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that &s;he tells the Gentlemen &s;he has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a La|dy. As a further proof of this affable di&s;|po&s;ition, he formerly receiv'd vi&s;its of the fair &s;ex in their ma&s;ques, till an imperti|nent fellow in a female di&s;gui&s;e mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he civilly promi|&s;ed at my reque&s;t, that my two &s;i&s;ters &s;hould be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your con&s;idera|tion.</P>

Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to <HI>Bath</HI> fell out in the three hundred &s;eventy &s;ixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady <HI>Sylvia.</HI> At the

pre&s;ent writing hereof it is the three hun|dred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your mo&s;t Serene Maje&s;ty, in who&s;e &s;ervice I was li&s;ted &s;ome weeks before I beheld your Si&s;ter. This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either &s;hall happen to be Queen-Regent at that time.</P>
<P>Pray tell your &s;i&s;ter, all the good qua|lities and virtuous inclinations &s;he has, never gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure in her conver&s;ation, as that one vice of her ob|&s;tinacy will give me mortification this month. <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> commands her to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and &s;he refu&s;es! indeed if I were in <HI>Berk|&s;hire</HI> I &s;hould honour her for this ob&s;tina|cy, and magnify her no le&s;s for di&s;obedi|ence than we do the <HI>Barcelonians.</HI> But people change with the change of places (as we &s;ee of late) and virtues become vi|ces when they cea&s;e to be for one's intere&s;t, with me, as with others.</P>
<P>Yet let me tell her, &s;he will never look &s;o finely while &s;he is upon earth, as &s;he would here in the water. It is not here as in mo&s;t other in&s;tances, for tho&s;e Ladies that would plea&s;e extremely, mu&s;t go <HI>out</HI> of their own element. She does not make half &s;o good a figure on hor&s;eback as <HI>Chri|&s;tina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but were &s;he once &s;een in the Bath, no man wou'd part with

her for the be&s;t Mermaid in chri&s;tendom. You know I have &s;een you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white; I have experienc'd the utmo&s;t you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful &s;teps, de&s;erve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and ea&s;y behaviour in <HI>Buckram:</HI> Some|thing between &s;wimming and walking, free enough, and more mode&s;tly-half-naked, than you can appear any where el&s;e. You have conquer'd enough already by land; &s;how your ambition, and vanqui&s;h al&s;o by water. We have no pretty Admirals on the&s;e Seas, but mu&s;t &s;trike &s;ails to your white Flags, were they once hoi&s;ted up. The Buckram I mention is a dre&s;s particu|larly u&s;eful at this time, when we are told the Prince&s;s is bringing over the fa&s;hion of <HI>German</HI> Ruffs: You ought to u&s;e your &s;elves to &s;ome degrees of &s;tiffne&s;s beforehand. And when our Ladies chins have been tickled a-while with &s;tarch'd mu&s;lin and wire, they may po&s;&s;ibly bear the bru&s;h of a <HI>German</HI> beard and whisker.</P>
<P>I cou'd tell you a delightful &s;tory of Dr <HI>P.</HI> but want room to di&s;play it in all its &s;hining circum&s;tances. He had heard it was an excellent cure for Love, to ki&s;s the Aunt of the per&s;on beloved, who is gene|rally of years and experience enough to

<P>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I mu&s;t tell you, &s;o very well, that I que&s;tion how you and I &s;hould agree if we were in a room by our &s;elves?

with my Lady <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who has all the &s;pirit of the la&s;t age, and all the gay experience of a plea&s;urable life.

<P>I mu&s;t tell you a truth, which is not however much to my credit. I never thought &s;o much of your &s;elf and your &s;i&s;ter, as &s;ince I have been four&s;core miles di&s;tance from you.

If Mrs. <HI>T.</HI> and you will but fall very &s;ick every &s;ea&s;on, I &s;hall certainly die for you.

There are but ju&s;t two Apartments, for the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, below; and but two apartments above, (very much inferior to them) in the whole Hou&s;e. When you look upon the Out&s;ide, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you &s;ee the In&s;ide, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a hou&s;e of Entries and Pa&s;|&s;ages; among which there are three Vi|&s;ta's through the whole, very u&s;ele&s;sly hand|&s;ome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but &s;poil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the &s;ight of &s;everal of the windows. There are two ordinary &s;tair-ca&s;es in&s;tead of one great one. The be&s;t things within the hou&s;e, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the mo&s;t commodious, and the be&s;t contrived, of the whole. At the top of the building are &s;everal Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini|cal and heavy. What &s;eems of the be&s;t ta&s;te, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with the&s;e tur|rets. The two Sides of the building are intirely &s;poil'd by two mon&s;trous bow|windows

which &s;tand ju&s;t in the middle, in&s;tead of doors: And as if it were fatal that &s;ome trifling littlene&s;s &s;hould every where de&s;troy the grandeur, there are in the chief front two &s;emicircles of a lower &s;tructure than the re&s;t, that cut off the angles, and look as if they were purpo&s;e|ly de&s;ign'd to hide a loftier and nobler piece of building, the top of which ap|pears above them.

<P>THE chief cau&s;e I have to repent my leaving the town, is the uncertainty I am in every day of your Si&s;ter's &s;tate of health.

<P>IT is with infinite &s;atisfaction I am made acquainted that your brother will at la&s;t prove your relation, and has en|tertain'd &s;uch &s;entiments as become him in your concern. I have been prepar'd for this by degrees, having &s;everal times re|ceiv'd from Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that which is one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures, the knowledge

As I have often condol'd with you in your ad|ver&s;ities, &s;o I have a right which but few can pretend to, of congratulating on the pro&s;pect of your better fortunes; and I hope for the future to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felici|ties. Tho' you mode&s;tly &s;ay the world has left you, yet I verily believe it is coming to you again as fa&s;t as it can: For to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis pa&s;t its power to op|po&s;e it. Therefore if you &s;hould take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it, you would be &s;o far from leading what is commonly call'd an un|&s;ettled life, (and what you with too much unju&s;t &s;everity call a Vagabond Life,) that the wi&s;e cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progre&s;s, who travels to gain the affections he has not, or to fix tho&s;e he already has; which he effectually does wherever he &s;hews him&s;elf.

<P>I Can &s;ay little to recommend the Let|ters I &s;hall write to you, but that they will be the mo&s;t impartial repre&s;entations of a free heart, and the true&s;t copies you ever &s;aw, tho' of a very mean original.

<P>The freedom I &s;hall u&s;e in this manner of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the be&s;t &s;ort of fools, the hone&s;t ones. And &s;ince what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up

at one time or other in &s;pight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almo&s;t fooli&s;h to take any pains to conceal it at all, and almo&s;t knavi&s;h to do it from tho&s;e that are our friends. If <HI>Momus</HI>'s project had taken, of having windows in our brea&s;ts, I &s;hou'd be for carrying it further, and making tho&s;e windows, ca&s;ements; that while a man &s;how'd his heart to all the world, he might do &s;omething more for his friends, even give it them, and tru&s;t it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King <HI>Herod</HI> did <HI>Herodias</HI> (tho' I never had &s;o much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a di&s;h, as he did another's head. But &s;ince <HI>Jupiter</HI> will not have it &s;o, I mu&s;t be con|tent to &s;hew my ta&s;te in life, as I do my ta&s;te in painting, by loving to have as lit|tle drapery as po&s;&s;ible. Not that I think every body naked altogether &s;o fine a &s;ight, as your &s;elf and a few more would be; but becau&s;e 'tis good to u&s;e people to what they mu&s;t be acquainted with; and there will certainly come &s;ome day of judgment or other, to uncover every &s;oul of us.

<PB N="201" REF="201">
that never girded their lions at all.&mdash;But a particular rea&s;on that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me, is, that I am confident no one knows you better; for I find, when others expre&s;s their thoughts of you, they fall ve|ry &s;hort of mine, and I know at the &s;ame time theirs are &s;uch as you would think &s;ufficiently in your favour.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine how de&s;irous I mu&s;t be of a corre&s;pondence with a per|&s;on, who had taught me long ago that it was as po&s;&s;ible to e&s;teem at fir&s;t &s;ight, as to love: and who has &s;ince ruin'd me for all the conver&s;ation of one &s;ex, and almo&s;t all the friend&s;hip of the other. I am but too &s;en&s;ible thro' your means, that the company of men wants a certain &s;oftne&s;s to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing el&s;e. How often have I been quietly going to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tranquility and indolence I had &s;o long found in the country; when one evening of your conver&s;ation has &s;poil'd me for a <HI>Solitaire!</HI> Books have lo&s;t their ef|fect upon me, and I was convinced &s;ince I &s;aw you, that there is one alive wi&s;er than all the Sages: a plague of female wi&s;|dom! it makes a man ten times more un|ea&s;y than his own. What is very &s;trange, Virtue her &s;elf, (when you have the dre&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="202" REF="202">
her) is too amiable for one's repo&s;e. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have &s;een you to have con|ver&s;ed with you; they would have been &s;trangely Bitt, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair Lady, and you had bewitch'd them with Rea&s;on and Virtue (two Beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy di&s;tance at which we cor|re&s;pond, removes a great many of tho&s;e re&s;trictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conver&s;ation prejudice truth, to &s;ave good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blu&s;h; we conver&s;e upon &s;uch unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, &s;hame, or de&s;ign, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impo&s;e (even in a &s;ingle thought) upon each other in this &s;tate of &s;eparation, as for Spirits of a different &s;phere who have &s;o little inter|cour&s;e with us, to employ that little (as &s;ome would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delu&s;ions upon poor mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a que&s;tion, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than mo&s;t
<PB N="203" REF="203">
in&s;tances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the la&s;t hour I &s;aw you?

<P>I never &s;ince pa&s;s by your hou&s;e but with the &s;ame &s;ort of melancholy that we feel upon &s;eeing the Tomb of a friend, which only &s;erves to put us in mind of what we have lo&s;t. I reflect upon the circum&s;tances of your departure which I was there a witne&s;s of (your behaviour in what I may call your la&s;t moments) and I indulge a gloomy kind of plea&s;ure in thinking that tho&s;e la&s;t moments were gi|ven to me.
