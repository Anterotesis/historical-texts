<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN reque&s;ting your permi&s;&s;ion to addre&s;s the
following pages to you, which as they
aim them&s;elves to be critical, require every pro|tection
and allowance that approving ta&s;te or
friendly prejudice can give them, I yet ven|tured
to mention no other motive than the gra|tification
of private friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. Had
I &s;ugge&s;ted a hope that your implied approba|tion
would give a &s;anction to their defects,
your particular re&s;erve, and di&s;like to the re|putation
of critical ta&s;te, as well as of poetical
talent, would have made you refu&s;e the pro|tection
of your name to &s;uch a purpo&s;e. How|ever,
I am not &s;o ungrateful as now to attempt
to combat this di&s;po&s;ition in you. I &s;hall not
here pre&s;ume to argue that the pre&s;ent &s;tate
of poetry claims and expects every a&s;&s;i&s;tance
that ta&s;te and example can afford it: nor en|deavour
to prove that a fa&s;tidious concealment
of the mo&s;t elegant productions of judgment and
fancy is an ill return for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
endowments.&mdash;Continue to deceive your&s;elf in
the idea that you are known only to be emi|nently
admired and regarded for the valuable
qualities that attach private friend&s;hips, and
the graceful talents that adorn conver&s;ation.
Enough of what you have written, has
&s;tolen into full public notice to an&s;wer my
purpo&s;e; and you will, perhaps, be the only
per&s;on, conver&s;ant in elegant literature, who
&s;hall read this addre&s;s and not perceive that by
publi&s;hing your particular approbation of the
following drama, I have a more intere&s;ted object
than to boa&s;t the true re&s;pect and regard with
which</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,

<P>"<HI>Theatrical intelligence extraordinary,</HI>"&mdash;<Q>We
hear there is a new tragedy in rehear&s;al at
Drury-Lane Theatre, call'd the SPANISH AR|MADA,
&s;aid to be written by Mr. PUFF, a
gentleman well known in the theatrical
world; if we may allow our&s;elves to give
credit to the report of the performers, who,
truth to &s;ay, are in general but indifferent
judges, this piece abounds with the mo&s;t
&s;triking and received beauties of modern
compo&s;ition</Q>&mdash;So! I am very glad my friend
PUFF's tragedy is in &s;uch forwardne&s;s.&mdash;Mrs.
Dangle, my dear, you will be very glad to
hear that PUFF's tragedy&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Dangle, why will you plague me
about &s;uch non&s;en&s;e?&mdash;Now the plays are be|gun
I &s;hall have no peace.&mdash;Isn't it &s;ufficient to
make your&s;elf ridiculous by your pa&s;&s;ion for the
theatre, without continually teazing me to join
you? Why can't you ride your hobby-hor&s;e
without de&s;iring to place me on a pillion behind
you, Mr. Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, I was only going to read&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; you never will read any thing that's
worth li&s;tening to:&mdash;you hate to hear about your
country; there are letters every day with Ro|man
&s;ignatures, demon&s;trating the certainty of
an inva&s;ion, and proving that the nation is ut|terly
undone&mdash;But you never will read any
thing to entertain one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has a woman to do with politics, Mrs.
Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what have you to do with the theatre,
Mr. Dangle? Why &s;hould you affect the cha|racter
of a Critic? I have no patience with you!
&mdash;haven't you made your&s;elf the je&s;t of all your
acquaintance by your interference in matters
where you have no bu&s;ine&s;s? Are not you call'd
a theatrical Quidnunc, and a mock Maecenas to
&s;econd-hand authors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; my power with the Managers is pretty
notorious; but is it no credit to have applica|tions
from all quarters for my intere&s;t?&mdash;From
lords to recommend fidlers, from ladies to get
<PB N="4" REF="10">
boxes, from authors to get an&s;wers, and from
actors to get engagements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly; you have contrived to get a
&s;hare in all the plague and trouble of theatri|cal
property, without the profit, or even the cre|dit
of the abu&s;e that attends it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure, Mrs. Dangle, you are no lo&s;er by
it, however; you have all the advantages of it:
&mdash;mightn't you, la&s;t winter, have had the read|ing
of the new Pantomime a fortnight pre|vious
to its performance? And doesn't Mr. Fo&s;|brook
let you take places for a play before it is
advertis'd, and &s;et you down for a Box for
every new piece through the &s;ea&s;on? And didn't
my friend, Mr. Smatter, dedicate his la&s;t Farce
to you at my particular reque&s;t, Mrs. Dangle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but wasn't the Farce damn'd, Mr.
Dangle? And to be &s;ure it is extremely plea&s;ant
to have one's hou&s;e made the motley rendezvous
of all the lackeys of literature!&mdash;The very high
change of trading authors and jobbing critics!&mdash;Yes,
my drawing-room is an ab&s;olute regi&s;ter-office
for candidate actors, and poets without
character;&mdash;then to be continually alarmed with
Mi&s;&s;es and Ma'ams piping hi&s;teric changes on
<PB N="5" REF="11">
JULIETS and DORINDAS, POLLYS and OPHELIAS;
and the very furniture trembling at the proba|tionary
&s;tarts and unprovok'd rants of would-be
RICHARDS and HAMLETS!&mdash;And what is wor&s;e
than all, now that the Manager has monopoliz'd
the Opera-Hou&s;e, haven't we the Signors and
Signioras calling here, &s;liding their &s;mooth &s;e|mibreves,
and gargling glib divi&s;ions in their
outlandi&s;h throats&mdash;with foreign emi&s;&s;aries and
French &s;pies, for ought I know, di&s;gui&s;ed like
fidlers and figure dancers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy! Mrs. Dangle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to employ your&s;elf &s;o idly at &s;uch an
alarming cri&s;is as this too&mdash;when, if you had the
lea&s;t &s;pirit, you would have been at the head of
one of the We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;ociations&mdash;or trailing
a volunteer pike in the Artillery Ground!&mdash;But
you&mdash;o'my con&s;cience, I believe if the French
were landed to-morrow, your fir&s;t enquiry
would be, whether they had brought a theat|rical
troop with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Dangle, it does not &s;ignify&mdash;I &s;ay the
&s;tage is "the Mirror of Nature," and the ac|tors
are "the Ab&s;tract, and brief Chronicles of
the Time:"&mdash;and pray what can a man of &s;en&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="12">
&s;tudy better?&mdash;Be&s;ides, you will not ea&s;ily per|&s;uade
me that there is no credit or importance
in being at the head of a band of critics, who
take upon them to decide for the whole town,
who&s;e opinion and patronage all writers &s;olicit,
and who&s;e recommendation no manager dares
refu&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!&mdash;Both managers and authors of
the lea&s;t merit, laugh at your preten&s;ions.&mdash;The
PUBLIC is their CRITIC&mdash;without who&s;e
fair approbation they know no play can re&s;t on
the &s;tage, and with who&s;e applau&s;e they welcome
&s;uch attacks as yours, and laugh at the malice
of them, where they can't at the wit.</P>

<P>Good morning to you, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Dangle and I have been diverting our|&s;elves
with the papers.&mdash;Pray, Sneer, won't you
go to Drury-lane theatre the fir&s;t night of
Puff's tragedy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I &s;uppo&s;e one &s;han't be able to get
in, for on the fir&s;t night of a new piece they
always fill the hou&s;e with orders to &s;upport it.
But here, Dangle, I have brought you two
pieces, one of which you mu&s;t exert your|&s;elf
to make the Managers accept, I can tell
you that, for 'tis written by a per&s;on of con&s;e|quence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! now my plagues are beginning!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, I am glad of it, for now you'll be
happy. Why, my dear Dangle, it is a plea|&s;ure
<PB N="8" REF="14">
to &s;ee how you enjoy your volunteer fa|tigue,
and your &s;olicited &s;olicitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a great trouble&mdash;yet, egad, its plea&s;ant
too.&mdash;Why, &s;ometimes of a morning, I have a
dozen people call on me at breakfa&s;t time,
who&s;e faces I never &s;aw before, nor ever de&s;ire
to &s;ee again.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t be very plea&s;ant indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And not a week but I receive fifty letters,

<P>"Bur&s;ts into tears, and exit." What, is
this a tragedy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's a genteel comedy, not a tran&s;la|tion&mdash;only
<HI>taken from the French;</HI> it is written
in a &s;tile which they have lately tried to run
down; the true &s;entimental, and nothing ridicu|lous
in it from the beginning to the end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if they had kept to that, I &s;hould
not have been &s;uch an enemy to the &s;tage, there
was &s;ome edification to be got from tho&s;e pieces,
Mr. Sneer!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am quite of your opinion, Mrs. Dangle;
the theatre, in proper hands, might certainly
be made the &s;chool of morality; but now, I am
&s;orry to &s;ay it, people &s;eem to go there princi|pally
for their entertainment!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would have been more to the credit of the
Managers to have kept it in the other line.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Madam, and hereafter perhaps
to have had it recorded, that in the mid&s;t of a
luxurious and di&s;&s;ipated age, they pre&s;erv'd <HI>two</HI>
hou&s;es in the capital, where the conver&s;ation
was always moral at lea&s;t, if not entertaining!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, egad, I think the wor&s;t alteration is in
the nicety of the audience.&mdash;No double enten|dre,
no &s;mart inuendo admitted; even Van|burgh
and Congreve oblig'd to undergo a
bungling reformation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and our prudery in this re&s;pect is ju&s;t on
a par with the artificial ba&s;hfulne&s;s of a courte|zan,
who encrea&s;es the blu&s;h upon her cheek in
an exact proportion to the diminution of her
mode&s;ty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sneer can't even give the Public a good
word!&mdash;But what have we here?&mdash;This &s;eems a
very odd&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, that's a comedy, on a very new plan;
replete with wit and mirth, yet of a mo&s;t &s;eri|ous
moral! You &s;ee it is call'd "THE RE|FORMED
HOUSEBREAKER;" where, by the mere
force of humour, HOUSEBREAKING is put into &s;o
ridiculous a light, that if the piece has its proper
run, I have no doubt but that bolts and bars will
be entirely u&s;ele&s;s by the end of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, this is new indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it is written by a particular friend of
mine, who has di&s;covered that the follies and foi|bles
of &s;ociety, are &s;ubjects unworthy the notice
of the Comic Mu&s;e, who &s;hould be taught to &s;toop
only at the greater vices and blacker crimes of
humanity&mdash;gibbeting capital offences in five acts,
and pillorying petty larcenies in two.&mdash;In &s;hort,
<PB N="11" REF="17">
his idea is to dramatize the penal laws, and
make the Stage a court of ea&s;e to the Old Bailey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is truly moral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Enter SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Fretful Plagiary, Sir.</P>

<P>Beg him to walk up.&mdash; <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Servant.]</STAGE> Now,
Mrs. Dangle, Sir Fretful Plagiary is an author

<P>I confe&s;s he is a favourite of mine, becau&s;e
every body el&s;e abu&s;es him.</P>

<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Very much to the credit of your charity,
Madam, if not of your judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANGLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, egad, he allows no merit to any author
but him&s;elf, that's the truth on't&mdash;tho' he's my
friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SNEER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.&mdash;He is as envious as an old maid
verging on the de&s;peration of &s;ix-and-thirty:
and then the in&s;iduous humility with which he
&s;educes you to give a free opinion on any of his
<PB N="12" REF="18">

u&s;ed as an appendage to adverti&s;ements, and

as the celebrated GEORGE BON-MOT was &s;aun|tering
down St. James's-&s;treet, he met the lively
Lady MARY MYRTLE, coming out of the
Park,&mdash;'Good God, LADY MARY, I'm &s;urpri&s;ed
to meet you in a white jacket,&mdash;for I expected
never to have &s;een you, but in a full-trim|med
unifor, and a light-hor&s;eman's cap!'&mdash;"Heavens,
GEORGE, where could you have
learned that?"&mdash;'Why, replied the wit, I ju&s;t
&s;aw a print of you, in a new publication called
The CAMP MAGAZINE, which, by the bye, is
a devili&s;h clever thing,&mdash;and is &s;old at No. 3, on
the right hand of the way, two doors from the
<PB N="43" REF="49">

<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the PUFF COLLUSIVE is the newe&s;t of
any; for it acts in the di&s;gui&s;e of determined
ho&s;tility.&mdash;It is much u&s;ed by bold book&s;ellers
and enterpri&s;ing poets.&mdash;An indignant corre&s;|pondent
ob&s;erves&mdash;that the new poem called
BEELZEBUB's COTILLION, or PROSERPINE's
FETE CHAMPETRE, is one of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifi|able
performances he ever read! The &s;everity
with which certain characters are handled is quite
&s;hocking! And as there are many de&s;criptions
in it too warmly coloured for female delicacy,
the &s;hameful avidity with which this piece is
bought by all people of fa&s;hion, is a reproach
on the ta&s;te of the times, and a di&s;grace to the
delicacy of the age!&mdash;Here you &s;ee the
two &s;tronge&s;t inducements are held forth;&mdash;Fir&s;t,
that nobody ought to read it;&mdash;and &s;econdly,
that every body buys it; on the &s;trength of
which, the publi&s;her boldly prints the tenth edi|tion,

<P>As to the PUFF OBLIQUE, or PUFF BY IM|PLICATION,
it is too various and exten&s;ive to
be illu&s;trated by an in&s;tance;&mdash;it attracts in
titles, and pre&s;umes in patents; it lurks in the
<HI>limitation</HI> of a &s;ub&s;cription, and invites in the
a&s;&s;urance of croud and incommodation at
public places; it delights to draw forth conceal|ed
merit, with a mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted a&s;&s;iduity; and
&s;ometimes wears a countenance of &s;miling cen|&s;ure
and tender reproach.&mdash;It has a wonderful
memory for Parliamentary Debates, and will of|ten
give the whole &s;peech of a favoured mem|ber,
with the mo&s;t flattering accuracy. But,
above all, it is a great dealer in reports and &s;up|po&s;itions.&mdash;It
has the earlie&s;t intelligence of in|tended
preferments that will reflect <HI>honor</HI> on the
<HI>patrons;</HI> and embryo promotions of mode&s;t
gentlemen&mdash;who know nothing of the matter
them&s;elves. It can hint a ribband for implied
&s;ervices, in the air of a common report; and
with the carele&s;ne&s;s of a ca&s;ual paragraph, &s;ug|ge&s;t
officers into commands&mdash;to which they have
no preten&s;ion but their wi&s;hes. This, Sir,
is the la&s;t principal cla&s;s in the ART of
PUFFING&mdash;An art which I hope you will
<PB N="45" REF="51">
now agree with me, is of the highe&s;t dignity&mdash;yielding
a tablature of benevolence and public
&s;pirit; befriending equally trade, gallantry, cri|tici&s;m,
and politics:&mdash;the applau&s;e of genius! the
regi&s;ter of charity! the triumph of heroi&s;m!
