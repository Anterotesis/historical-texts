<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Nece&s;&s;ity of publi&s;hing a new PEERAGE of SCOTLAND, and the Utili|ty
of it, is acknowledged by all. The Compiler of this pre&s;ent Work
has attempted it upon a more regular and accurate Plan than has hitherto appear|ed:
How far he has &s;ucceeded the World mu&s;t judge: But if the mo&s;t a&s;&s;idu|ous
Application for many Years; if a painful Enquiry into the public Records,
and ancient Chartularies; if an unwearied Search after every Degree of Know|ledge,
nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on &s;o arduous a Task; if the&s;e have any Merit, or
de&s;erve the Favour of the Public, the Author flatters him&s;elf this Work, on Per|u&s;al,
will not be found deficient. Neither has he relied &s;olely upon his own
Skill: He acknowledges, with the utmo&s;t Gratitude, the Obligations he lies un|der
to <HI>Walter MacFarlane,</HI> E&s;q; of that Ilk, for the generous and benevolent
Communication of that Trea&s;ury of <HI>Scotch</HI> Antiquities of which he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
Nor have the Keepers of the public Archives been wanting in contributing all
in their Power to forward the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all that has been done, there doubtle&s;s may, and will be,
Mi&s;takes, &s;uch are unavoidable in a Work of this Kind, though the Author hopes
they will not be found numerous, as all Manner of Pains has been taken to avoid
them, as well by the Labour be&s;towed upon the Compilation, as by putting it
in the Power of every Peer to correct or add to the Hi&s;tory of his own Family,
by &s;ending him a Manu&s;cript Copy &s;ome Time before Publication, they produc|ing
&s;ufficient Documents in Support of any Alteration made: And where the
Hi&s;tory of any particular Family in this Work varies, either from former Au|thors,
or from received Family Opinions, Care has been taken to ju&s;tify the Dif|ference
of Sentiment, by undoubted Authorities quoted on the Margin.</P>
<P>ANY <HI>Inaccuracies that may be in Point of Language, 'tis hoped the Reader will
overlook.</HI> It mu&s;t be owned that has not been &s;o much attended to. The chief
and principal Point the Author had in View, and the great Object of his Attention
being, in a plain and di&s;tinct Manner, to deduce the Hi&s;tory of each Family from
its Origin to the pre&s;ent Generation, and to a&s;certain their Genealogy and Chro|nology
by undi&s;puted Documents. This, 'tis hoped, is done, and nothing fur|ther
is pretended. Such E&s;capes or Omi&s;&s;ions as have been di&s;covered in parti|cular
Families &s;ince they were printed off, are carefully in&s;erted in the Addenda
at the End of the PEERAGE.</P>
<P>IT will probably be ob&s;erved by our Readers, that certain Chartularies, and
other Vouchers, quoted on the Margin, are &s;aid to be <HI>penes MacFarlane,</HI> though
the Originals are actually in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others; but as that great and inge|nious
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
Antiquary, in his valuable Collection, has authenticated Copies of all the&s;e
Documents, the Author was obliged to quote tho&s;e Copies when he had not Ac|ce&s;s
to the Originals.</P>
<P>'Tis thought proper here al&s;o to inform our Readers, that in engraving the Arms
of the Nobility, as prefixed to this Work, the Order is followed in which they
are ranked in the Roll made up at the Union Parliament in 1706 and 1707,
which has been looked on as an authentic Roll ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged, that, according to our printed Propo&s;als, there &s;hould have
been added a &s;hort Sy&s;tem of Heraldry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but as this Volume has &s;welled to
a much greater Bulk than was expected, that Treati&s;e mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the
&s;econd Part of this Work, the BARONAGE, or an Account of the GENTRY of <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
and as there are few Peers but have &s;ome De&s;cendents who will appear in
the BARONAGE, there will then be a proper Opportunity of publi&s;hing any re|markable
Event that has been omitted here.</P>
<P>THE Addenda, or Alterations &s;ince this Work has been put to the Pre&s;s, the
Author has thrown at the End of this Volume; and, for the greater Ea&s;e to the
Reader, has reduced them to alphabetical Order, by which Means any Thing
wanted may ea&s;ily be found out.</P>
<P>THE Reader is de&s;ired to excu&s;e &s;ome &s;eeming Inaccuracies that appear in
numbering the Pages of this Work. The&s;e were occa&s;ioned by the Additions
made to &s;everal Families &s;ince they were fir&s;t printed off, whereby the Num|bers
of many Pages are doubled.</P>

<HEAD>HAMILTON Earl of ABERCORN.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the illu&s;trious peerage of
Scotland that pre&s;ents to our readers,
in alphabetical order, is HAMILTON Earl of
ABERCORN, the undoubted heir-male of the
great and noble family of Hamilton; a fami|ly
who have equally di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves
in the field and at the council-board, and have
been no le&s;s remarkable in the hi&s;tories of fo|reign
nations, than in the annals of Scotland.</P>
<P>But as the dignity, e&s;tate, and honours of
this hou&s;e, have de&s;cended in the female as
well as in the male &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for its origin
and antiquity, we refer our readers to the Ti|tle
<HI>Duke of Hamilton,</HI> and deduce the family of
Abercorn from their immediate predece&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>X. JAMES, &s;econd earl of Arran, and duke
of Chatelherault, the tenth generation of the
family of Hamilton, in a direct male line.
This earl married lady Margaret Douglas,
elde&s;t daughter of James earl of Morton, by
whom he had four &s;ons and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Arran and duke of
Chatelherault, who died without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>john,</HI> who was the fir&s;t marquis
of Hamilton, and carried on the line of the
family.</P>
<P>3. Lord <HI>Claud,</HI> the fir&s;t of the family of
Abercorn.</P>
<P>For the other children, and their marri|ages,
<HI>vide</HI> Title <HI>Duke of Hamilton.</HI></P>
<P>XI. Lord CLAUD HAMILTON, third &s;on
of James earl of Arran and duke of Cha|telherault,
when very young was appointed
commendator of the abbacy of Pai&s;ley, up|on
the re&s;ignation of John archbi&s;hop of St.
Andrews, <HI>anno</HI> 1553,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's Peerage of Scotl. Lodge's Peerage of Ire|land. Scots Compend.&amp;c.</NOTE> which was ratified and
approved by pope Julius III. He was a brave
and gallant gentleman, of &s;teady honour, and
unchangeable integrity; who, by a &s;eries of
virtuous actions, reflected lu&s;tre on his great
ance&s;tors, and ennobled the illu&s;trious blood
that ran in his veins, During the melancho|ly
di&s;cords that prevailed in Scotland, under
the unhappy reign of queen Mary, he ad|hered
to her intere&s;t in all her misfortunes.
Prompted by his own innate bravery, and
his loyalty to his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, he appear|ed
and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the la&s;t effort
that was made in her cau&s;e at the battle of
Lang&s;ide, <HI>anno</HI> 1568. In vain he di&s;played
the skill and courage of a great commander:
the battle was lo&s;t, and proved fatal to the
queen's party.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle, lord Claud,
with many others, was &s;ummoned to attend
a parliament, called together by the earl of
Murray, then regent, and, upon his refu&s;al,
was outlawed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> and his e&s;tate forfeited.</P>
<P>During the regency of the earl of Mar,
his lands were given to the lord Semple,
who kept a &s;trong garri&s;on in his ca&s;tle, and
exerci&s;ed all around a &s;evere military di&s;ci|pline,
di&s;playing every violence and oppre&s;&s;i|on
that power can do, to maintain a precari|ous
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. At length this gallant lord,
<PB N="2" REF="11">
&s;upported by his faithful tenants, ro&s;e in arms,
be&s;ieged the ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland, page 151, vol. III. M. S. Hi&s;t. of the family pe|nes com. de Abercorn.</NOTE> and obliged lord Semple
to Iurrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>During the regency of Morton, lord Claud
was a &s;harer of the oppre&s;&s;ions that bore down
the Hamilton family. He was obliged to fly
to England for &s;afety, not daring to tru&s;t the
prevailing faction, though his forfeiture had
been repealed by the act of parliament con|firming
the pacification of Perth, <HI>anno</HI> 1573.
But when the king took the management of
affairs into his own hands, and reflected on
the different parties that divided the nation,
he &s;oon perceived that the flood of per&s;ecuti|on,
that overwhelmed the Hamiltons, was ow|ing
to no other cau&s;e but their zealous and
&s;teady attachment to his unhappy mother; he
therefore re&s;tored them to all their e&s;tates and
honours, and heaped many other favours
upon them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. et Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> in particular, he be&s;towed upon
lord Claud, and his heirs-male, or a&s;&s;igneys,
by charter, all the lord&s;hip and barony of
Pai&s;ley, with the pertinents belonging to the
abbacy and mona&s;tery thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an|num 1585.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1585.
And, as a further te&s;timony of his e&s;teem and
regard for him, he was plea&s;ed, in con&s;idera|tion
of his con&s;tant loyalty, great lo&s;&s;es and
&s;ufferings, to create him a peer, by the title
of lord Pai&s;ley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an|num 1587.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1587.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty likewi&s;e granted, by another
charter, to lord Claud Hamilton, now lord
Pai&s;ley, and his heirs-male whatever, the ba|rony
and regality of the burgh of Pai&s;ley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an|num 1591.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.

<P>And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an|num 1593.</NOTE> by another charter, the five pound
land of Sanquhar, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1593.</P>
<P>This lord died advanced in age and cha|racter,
<HI>anno</HI> 1621, having married Margaret
daughter of George lord Scton, by whom
he had four &s;ons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards earl of Abercorn.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Cland Hamilton,</HI> who married the
daughter and heire&s;s of &s;ir Robert Hamilton
of Elie&s;ton, in the county of Tyrone in Ire|land,
by whom he had &s;ix &s;ons and two daugh|ters;
of them the Hamiltons of Elic&s;ton, Mon|terlony,
and &s;everal other con&s;iderable families
in Ireland, are de&s;cended. He was gentle|man
of the bedchamber to the King, and was
made con&s;table and commander of the ca&s;tle

<HI>anno</HI> 1618.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE></P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>George Hamilton</HI> of Greenlaw and
Ro&s;erea, in the county of Tipperara in Ire|land,
who behaved with great bravery in
the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty king Charles I.
He married, I&s;t, I&s;abella of the family of Ci|vicot

of the vi&s;count of Boyne in Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and peerage of Ireland.</NOTE></P>
<P>His daughter Margaret was married to
William marquis of Douglas.</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, fir&s;t &s;on of Claud lord Pai&s;|ley,
commonly de&s;igned ma&s;ter of Pai&s;ley,
was a man of eminent parts, and much tak|en
notice of at court. He was highly e&s;teem|ed
by the King, who made him one of the
lords of his privy-council, and gentleman
of his bed-chamber, when he was but a
young man; and gave him by a charter, <HI>an|no</HI>
1600,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad ann. 1600.</NOTE> the office of high-&s;heriff of the
county of Linlithgow, with all the fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

<P>And by another charter in 1601,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. ad ann. 1601.</NOTE> the
lands and manour of Abercorn, Braidmeadows,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The king was afterwards plea&s;ed, on ac|count
of his great merit, to create him ba|ron
of Abercorn; and, by a new charter, to
erect the lands of the lord&s;hip and barony of
Abercorn, the lands of Dudding&s;ton, New|ton
and Duntarvie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into one free barony,
<HI>anno</HI> 1603;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. ad ann. 1063.</NOTE> and in 1606, his maje&s;ty fur|ther
honoured him with the titles of earl of

his heirs-male whatever;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's Peerage. Peerage of Ireland. Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Compend.</NOTE> and the &s;ame year

<P>He was appointed one of the lords of the
privy-council of the kingdom of Ireland, and
was &s;ummoned to attend the parliament there
with the precedency of an earl; and had a
large grant of lands in the barony of Stra|bane,
upon which he built a &s;trong and fair
ca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE> and a church.</P>
<P>He married Mariana, daughter of Thomas

<P>He followed the fortune of king James
VII. at the revolution in 1688, attended
that prince in his expedition to Ireland, where
he was &s;worn one of his privy-council, and

of Strabane became extinct; and the third

<P>THE family of Abernethy is of great an|tiquiry,

in Scotland before &s;irnames were u&s;ed. And
tho' 'tis evident there was no peerage in the
family, till Laurence Abernethy of Salton was
created a lord of parliament by king James II.
yet, in compliance with the example of our
hi&s;torians, who have always looked upon them
in this rank, on account of the con&s;iderable
place they held among&s;t the great barons, we
have here in&s;erted them in the fir&s;t part of

in &s;ome other families, which the can|did

<P>THIS noble family, remarkable for ma|ny

<HEAD>STUART Duke of ALBANY.</HEAD>
<P>ROBERT STUART, third &s;on of king
Robert II. by Elizabeth More, was
the fir&s;t who enjoyed this title. He was
fir&s;t earl of Menteith, which title he got by
his marriage, and afterwards earl of Fife, by
the re&s;ignation of the counte&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>He was a man of high accompli&s;hments,
equally qualified to &s;hine in the arts of peace,
or in the troubles of war; for which rea&s;on
the king, his father, being infirm with age,
made him governor of Scotland in his own
lifetime; and his brother, king Robert III.
after his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and &s;everal Scotch writers.</NOTE> being like|wi&s;e
valetudinary, thought fit to continue
him in the regency, and dignified him with
the title of duke of Albany, <HI>anno</HI> 1399.</P>
<P>Upon the death of king Robert III. his
&s;on king James I. being pri&s;oner in England,
the duke of Albany of right became gover|nor
of the kingdom for his nephew; in which
office he continued till his death.</P>
<P>He commanded the Scotch army in &s;eve|ral
engagements again&s;t the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and Stuart's hi&s;t. of the family of Stuart.</NOTE> and al|ways
behaved with &s;uch courage and conduct,
that he generally came off victorious, though
inferior in numbers to the enemy. And as
he had di&s;charged his tru&s;t, in all the high
offices he enjoyed, with great wi&s;dom, pru|dence
and integrity, his death, which hap|pened
in 1420, was univer&s;ally lamented.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, Margaret, grandchild and

<P>MURDOCH, fir&s;t &s;on of Robert duke of
Albany, &s;ucceeded to his father's e&s;tate and
honours, and al&s;o to the government of the
kingdom; but he did not inherit all his fa|ther's
good qualities. However he was both
active and very in&s;trumental in bringing home
king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which was happily accompli&s;h|ed
in 1424, and, as earl of Fife, he placed the
king in his chair of &s;tate at his coronation in
Scoon.</P>
<P>But as the duke became too great for a
&s;ubject, he was &s;u&s;pected to have a de&s;ign
upon the crown; and being di&s;covered to be
engaged in &s;ome &s;ecret plots and tran&s;actions,
(the nature of them all our hi&s;torians are &s;i|lent

his wicked practices were di&s;covered; his

<P>When king Charles's troubles begun, he join|ed
the parliament of Scotland, and was a zeal|ous
a&s;&s;erter of the Presbyterian church-govern|ment;
but after the horrid murder of the king,
he contributed much to the reception and
coronation of king Charles II. on the 1&s;t of
January 1650, and had the honour to put the
crown on the king's head at Scoon. But hav|ing
afterwards joined and &s;ided with Oliver
Cromwell (a common fault in tho&s;e times) he
was &s;oon after the re&s;toration convicted of high
trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the marquis of Argyle. Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> condemned by the parliament, and
beheaded at Edinburgh on the 27th of May
1661, and his e&s;tate and honours forfeited to

<P>He was a con&s;ummate &s;tate&s;man, and one of
the able&s;t politicians of his time. When he
was going to death, he declared his abhor|rence
of the murder of king Charles I.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Douglas, daugh|ter

<P>XXI. ARCHIBALD, lord Lorn, elde&s;t &s;on

intere&s;t, during all the time of the u&s;urpati|on,
and was captain of his maje&s;ty's foot|guards,
<HI>anno</HI> 1650. He continued to &s;erve
the king with great &s;teadine&s;s and fidelity, and
&s;ignalized him&s;elf upon &s;everal occa&s;ions a|gain&s;t

could be prevailed upon to &s;ubmit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Craw&s;urd's peerage, and &s;tate tracts.</NOTE> or come
to any compo&s;ition with Cromwell, till he got
his maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion by general Middleton
&s;o to do, which was dated 31&s;t December
1655. He then returned to his own hou&s;e,
where he lived privately and quietly, &s;till per|&s;i&s;ting
in his integrity and loyalty, till king
Charles II. was happily re&s;tored, <HI>anno</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty being perfectly &s;atisfied of this
lord's good behaviour, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
<PB N="41" REF="50">
to re&s;tore him to his father's e&s;tate, and the
honours and precedency of the ancient earls
of Argyle:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in archiv. Caro|li II. &amp;c.</NOTE> The onerous cau&s;e in the pa|tent

<P>Sometime thereafter he was made one of
his maje&s;ty's privy-council, and a commi&s;&s;io|ner
of the trea&s;ury; which offices he di&s;charg|ed
with great &s;idelity; but as he was a &s;tre|nuous
a&s;&s;erter and firm friend to the Prote|&s;tant
religion, and Presbyterian church go|vernment,
he thereby had &s;ome con&s;iderable
enemies at court.</P>
<P>About the year 1680, the te&s;t act pa&s;&s;ed,
whereby all ranks of people were enjoined,
by act of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Te&s;t act in the records.</NOTE> to defend the govern|ment
in church and &s;tate, as pre&s;ently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the pains of trea&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and this act went very ill down with a great
many well-meaning men, particularly with
this noble earl, who, having a tender and
&s;crupulous con&s;cience, could not comply with
it in the&s;e terms, but offered to take it with his
own explanation, part whereof was in the&s;e
words:</P>
<P><Q>"I take it, in &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with
it&s;elf, and the prote&s;tant religion; and I
do declare, I mean not to bind up my&s;elf

any thing I think for the advan|tage
of the church or &s;tate, not repugnant
to the prote&s;tant religion and my loyalty;
and this I under&s;tand as a part of my oath."</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE></P>
<P>This being declared trea&s;on by the learn|ed
of the law, he was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the
ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, &s;oon after tried, found
guilty, his e&s;tate forfeited, and him&s;elf &s;en|tenced
to &s;uffer death: but he made his e&s;cape
in the dre&s;s of a lady's page, and got over to
Holland, where he remained about four years.
However, in the beginning of king James
VII.'s reign, he got &s;ome officers and &s;ol|diers
together in Holland, with which he in|vaded
Scotland, and landed in Argyle&s;hire.</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed about two thou&s;and men, mo&s;tly
of his own clan. He then emitted a manife&s;to,
declaring, <Q REND="inline">"That he had not invaded his coun|try
for any private ends, but in defence of
his own ju&s;t right, and for the recovery of
his e&s;tate, which was unju&s;tly forfeited in
the reign of the late king. And the duke
of York having invaded the religion and
liberties of the kingdom, he thought it not
only ju&s;t, but his duty to God and his coun|try,
to oppo&s;e his tyrannical u&s;urpation, and
invited all true prote&s;tants to join him."</Q></P>
<P>The earl's little army being defeated and
di&s;per&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch comp. p. 103.</NOTE> and him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, he was
again &s;ent to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and
&s;oon thereafter beheaded at the mercat-cro&s;s,
in con&s;equence of his former &s;entence, upon
the 30th of June 1685; it being the opini|on
of the lawyers, that as he was already dead
in law, he could not be tried again for this
la&s;t act of rebellion.</P>
<P>He left i&s;&s;ue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> by lady Mary Stewart his

of Orange, from Holland, in 1688; and was
owned by the convention of e&s;tates to be
earl of Argyle, before his father's forfeiture
was re&s;cinded.</P>
<P>He was a great promoter of the revolution,
and was &s;ent to London by the nobility and

he went early into the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, and
bravely di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf thro' the whole
cour&s;e of queen Anne's wars.</P>
<P>In 1701, he had the command of a regi|ment

of the thi&s;tle, and her maje&s;ty's high com|mi&s;&s;ioner

<P>He remarkably &s;ignalized him&s;elf at the
battle of Ramillies in 1706, and at the at|tack

place he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He commanded at reducing the fort of Ple|pondale,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;iege of O&s;tend, and
was very &s;erviceable at the battle of Aude|nard,

city he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;) al&s;o at the &s;iege of
Ghent and Bruges in 1709.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year he particularly aggrandiz|ed
him&s;elf at the &s;iege of Tournay, and at
the terrible attack of the wood in the great
battle of Malplaquet, upon which de&s;perate
command he was ordered by the duke of
Marlborough, who, ('tis alledged) then be|gun
to be jealous of his ri&s;ing glory.</P>
<P>He was created baron of Chatham, earl
of Greenwich in England, and was general
and commander in chief of her maje&s;ty's forces
in Spain, <HI>anno</HI> 1710; was governor of Mi|norca,
and one of the privy-council in Eng|land,
and was made knight of the mo&s;t noble

<P>On the death of queen Anne, he was one

and the earl of Mar had the addre&s;s to
get together no le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even thou|&s;and
Highlanders, who marched from Perth
about the 12th of November. The duke of
Argyle marched out from Stirling about the
&s;ame time to oppo&s;e them. They came to
an engagement at Sheriffmuir upon the 13th,
where the duke of Argyle's courage and con|duct
was very remarkable; for tho' the rebels
were far more numerous (and many of the
clans fought very gallantly) yet they were
forced to retreat to Perth, and the duke of
Argyle returned to Stirling; however, the
rebels never came to a head again.</P>
<P>In the year 1718, he was made lord &s;tew|ard
of the hou&s;hold, and was created duke
of Greenwich, but the patent was limited to
the heirs-male of his body.</P>
<P>He was colonel, fir&s;t, of the queen's regi|ment
of hor&s;e, and then of the royal blue
hor&s;e guards. He was likeways ma&s;ter-gene|ral
of the ordnance, and field-mar&s;hal of Great
Britain.</P>
<P>He was no le&s;s con&s;picuous for his &s;pirited
eloquence in the hou&s;e of peers, than for his
courage and conduct in the field. He parti|cularly
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the noble de|fence
he made of the privileges of the town
of Edinburgh, when it was moved that they
&s;hould be taken away, on account of the mur|der

him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the law at U|trecht;
but upon his father's being created a
duke, he laid a&s;ide the &s;cheme of appearing
at the bar, and betook him&s;elf to a military
life, &s;erved under the great duke of Marlbo|rough,
was colonel of the thirty-&s;ixth regi|ment
of foot, and governor of Dambarton
ca&s;tle: But his genius pointing more &s;trong|ly
to the &s;tate&s;man than the &s;oldier, he did

him&s;elf chiefly to that &s;tudy, which made the

<P>In 1705, he was made trea&s;urer of Scot|land,
and took his &s;eat in the parliament,
where he made &s;o great a figure, that in 1706

<P>In 1708; he was made an extraordinary

<P>In 1710, he was made ju&s;tice-general of

<P>In 1714, upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king George

he had long before given up all command in
the army, yet, upon the breaking out of the

arms, in defence of the hou&s;e of Hanover,
and, by his prudent conduct in the we&s;t high|lands,
prevented general Gordon, at the head
of 3000 men, from penetrating into the coun|try,
and rai&s;ing levies. He afterwards join|ed
his brother at Stirling, and was wounded
at the battle of Dumblane.</P>
<P>In 1725, he got the privy &s;eal, and was
tru&s;ted with the direction of Scotch affairs.</P>
<P>In 1734, upon his re&s;igning the privy &s;eal,
he was made keeper of the great &s;eal, which
he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>Upon the dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of his brother, he be|came
dake of Argyle, hereditary ju&s;tice ge|neral,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">euten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">t, &s;heriff and commi&s;&s;ary of
Argyle&s;hire, and the we&s;tern i&s;les, hereditary
great ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold, hereditary keep|er
of Dun&s;taffnage, Carrick, and &s;everal other
ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>He was a man of great natural and acquired
endowments, quick, penetrating, and tho|roughly
ver&s;ant in the knowledge of man|kind;
of an accurate and di&s;tinct elocution,
and a ready judgment. His thorough know|ledge
of the laws of his country qualified him
to &s;hine in the great council of the nation,
and in the cabinet of his &s;overeign. His great
&s;agacity and uncommon abilities, pointed him
out as a proper per&s;on for the chief manage|ment
of all Scotch affairs; and the propriety
of the choice will appear from his attention
to promote trade and manufactures, to en|courage
learning and learned men, and for|ward
every improvement for the good of his
country.</P>
<P>During his admini&s;tration; the manufac|ture
of linen cloth was rai&s;ed to an uncom|mon
pitch, both in quality and quantity.
The univer&s;ities received di&s;tingui&s;hing marks
of his favour, by e&s;tabli&s;hing new profe&s;|&s;ions,
and in every &s;hape promoting their
good: particularly, he encouraged the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of phy&s;ic in the univer&s;ity of Edin|burgh,
which is now a &s;chool for that &s;ci|ence,
famous all over Europe.</P>
<P>He procured from his late maje&s;ty, king
George II. for the infirmary of Edinburgh,
the invalid money, to the extent of about
8000l. a &s;um that enabled the managers of
that ho&s;pital to enlarge their plan con&s;iderab|ly,
the utility of which is daily felt by the
numbers of poor patients, both civil and mi|litary,
who find relief from this charity.</P>
<P>After 1745, in order to de&s;troy the &s;eeds
of future rebellions, he advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty
to employ the highlanders in the army; a
propo&s;al worthy of the patriot who contrived
it, magnanimous in the king who approved
it, and mo&s;t honourable to them&s;elves who
executed it; for it mu&s;t be owned that, to
this wi&s;e coun&s;el, 'tis in &s;ome mea&s;ure ow|ing,
that Cape Breton, Canada, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> are
now under the government of this kingdom,
as the courage and intrepidity of the&s;e brave
and heroic men, wherever they were called,
doubtle&s;s contributed greatly to the conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Such was Archib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d in a public &s;phere;
nor was he le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed in private life.
His eminent learning, and &s;trong natural ta|lents,
contributed to make him pa&s;s his hours
of rece&s;s from bu&s;ine&s;s agreeably to him&s;elf,
and for the in&s;truction and good of others.
He was qualified for every &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation,
with the greate&s;t philo&s;opher, or the
meane&s;t and mo&s;t ingenious mechanic. For
the amu&s;ement of the clo&s;et, he collected the
mo&s;t valuable private library in Great Bri|tain,
where he unbent his mind from the
cares of mini&s;terial affairs, and added to the
immen&s;e &s;tock of knowledge he had already
acquired.</P>
<P>The noble and magnificent palace which
<PB N="44" REF="53">
he has built at Inverara, will &s;tand a la&s;ting
monument of the regard he had for his fami|ly,
who before had no hou&s;e &s;uitable to their
dignity.</P>
<P>This great man enjoyed all the faculties of
his mind found and entire till his death, which
happened very &s;uddenly, on the 15th day of
April 1761, in the 79th year of his age;
and was, according to his own orders, buried
at Kilmun, in the pari&s;h of Dunoon in Ar|gyle&s;hire,
the burying-place of the family.
And having no i&s;&s;ue, his e&s;tate and honours
devolved upon his cou&s;in and heir-male ge|neral
John Campbell, (now duke of Argyle)
elde&s;t &s;on and heir of the honourable John
Campbell of Mammore, to whom we now

<P>During the rebellion in 1715, he &s;erved

that war; and, while a commone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, was
promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
He was groom of the bed-chamber to the late
king, while prince of Wales, and continued
to be &s;o to his maje&s;ty during the whole of
his reign. He was for many years colonel
of the royal Scotch fuzileers, and thereafter of
the royal Scots-grey dragoons, which he now
commands. He is al&s;o lieutenant-general on
the &s;taff in England, and governor of Lime|rick
ca&s;tle in Ireland.</P>
<P>His father and he repre&s;ented the county
of Dumbarton in every parliament &s;ince the
union. In April 1761, he was re-elected
for that county, but &s;ucceeding immediately
thereafter to the e&s;tate and honours of Argyle,
he was, on the 5th day of May 1761, elec|ted
one of the &s;ixteen peers for repre&s;enting
the peerage of Scotland in parliament, and is
now the fourth duke.</P>
<P>In the 1720, he married the honourable

and illu&s;trious family had con&s;iderable e&s;tates,
both in Perth&s;hire and the northern counties,
in the tenth and eleventh centuries. But we
&s;hall pa&s;s over all traditional accounts, and
proceed to our documents.</P>
<P>I. FRISKINUS de MORAVIA was pro|prietor
of a va&s;t many lands and baronies in
different counties, and made a great figure in
Scotland in the reign of king David I. who
&s;ucceeded to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1124, and died
<HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>This Friskin was father of</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM de MORAVIA, who got a
charter, under the great &s;eal of king William
the lyon, <HI>Willielmo de Moravia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ilio Fris|kini,</HI>
of the lands of Strabrock, Duffus, Ro&s;&s;ile,
Inchikel, Macher, Kintrai, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his father Friskin in the
reign of king David I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quas terras Friskinus pa|ter &s;uus te|nuit, tempore regis David; &amp;c. Chart. penes comi|tem de Bu|chan.</NOTE> The charter has no
date; but as Felix, bi&s;hop of Murray, was wit|ne&s;s
to it, it mu&s;t have been granted in or be|fore
the year 1171, in which that bi&s;hop died.</P>
<P>William had i&s;&s;ue two &s;ons, betwixt whom
he divided his lands.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Hugh.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> of whom the Murrays of
Pettie, Bothwell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are de&s;cended. <HI>Vide</HI>

<P>III. HUGH, the elde&s;t &s;on, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the lands of Du&s;&s;us; which then was the
chief &s;eat of the family, and had a &s;on;</P>

<P>Walter was father of</P>
<P>V. FRISKINUS de MORAVIA, who, in
an agreement about the marches of &s;ome lands
with Simon bi&s;hop of Murray, is de&s;igned
<HI>Friskinus de Moravia, dominus de Duffus, fili|us
Walteri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. p. 92.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1248.</P>
<P>This Friskinus had no male-i&s;&s;ue, and but
two daughters,</P>
<P>VI. 1. HELEN; married to &s;ir Reynold
de Cheyne, who with her obtained the ba|rony
of Duffus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. and Nis|bet's append. p. 192.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> married to William de Fede|rith.</P>
<P>In a charter by Mali&s;e, earl of Strathern,
to his &s;i&s;ter Annabella of the lands of Kin|cardine,
the above Friskinus de Moravia de
Duffus, together with &s;ir Malcolm de Mo|ravia,
are witne&s;&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Montro&s;e.</NOTE> The charter is dated
at Selkirk the 28th of June, the 22d year

<P>This &s;ir Malcolm was the undoubted an|ce&s;tor

was &s;on of &s;ir John de Moravia, high &s;heriff of
Perth, who probably was a grand&s;on of the
fir&s;t Friskin, and brother of Hugh, tho' we
cannot, at this di&s;tance of time, po&s;itively a&s;|certain
the relation.</P>
<P>From this &s;ir John therefore (by good au|thority)
we &s;hall deduce the de&s;cent of this
illu&s;trious family, which hath flouri&s;hed in
Perth&s;hire, with great lu&s;tre, about &s;ix hun|dred
years.</P>
<P>I. Sir JOHN de MORAVIA, or MURRAY,
appears to have been a man of the fir&s;t rank;
and made a con&s;iderable figure in the end of
the reign of king William the lion, and be|ginning
of king Alexander II. who &s;ucceeded
to the crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>He is particularly named in a donation to

of the reign of king Alexander II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Chartul. of Murray, pe|nes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">und. and writs of the family of Su|therland.</NOTE> and had a

<P>He was appointed one of the &s;ix governors

of John Baliol;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom II. p. 558.</NOTE> and we find him &s;oon

<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>VIII. JOHN CUMMIN, lord of Badenoch,
who was a man of exten&s;ive property, pow|erful
by his wealth and dependents, cunning,
artful and di&s;&s;embling, fond of dignity and
rank; and, provided he could obtain his wi&s;hes,
extremely carele&s;s by what means, however
ba&s;e and di&s;honourable.</P>
<P>Scotland had now for a con&s;iderable time
groaned under the yoke of Engli&s;h &s;ervitude;
Baliol had meanly given up his pretended
right to the crown to Edward; Bruce had
&s;ecretly intimated to his friends his intention
of a&s;&s;erting his title to the royal dignity, and
redeeming the liberty of his country. Cum|min,
ever mindful of his own intere&s;t, enter|ed
into the de&s;ign, and made a &s;olemn engage|ment
with Robert to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his
power in mounting the throne; provided,
upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the affair, he &s;hould be
re&s;tored to the va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions his family had
enjoyed, which would have aggrandized him
much beyond any other &s;ubject, and placed
him in a condition little inferior to royal:
but, upon maturer con&s;ideration, and weigh|ing
the matter in the balance of &s;elf-intere&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, For|dun, Aber|crombie, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>
he began to doubt the event; the attempt was
hazardous; he dreaded the &s;trength of Eng|land;
every chance &s;eemed again&s;t the cau&s;e;
if it failed, he was undone: how to mend the
&s;tep he had taken was to be determined; his
own black heart &s;ugge&s;ted the dete&s;table re|medy,
either from the hopes of great re|wards
from the Engli&s;h, or perhaps with a
view to the crown it&s;elf, in virtue of his mo|ther,
who was Baliol's &s;i&s;ter; he divulged the
whole &s;chemes of the Scotch patriots to the
king of England. Bruce was then in Lon|don,
but happily in time di&s;covered he was be|trayed,
<PB N="59" REF="68">
and, not without difficulty, made his
e&s;cape to Scotland, where finding clear proof
of the villainy of Cummin, he cau&s;ed pur&s;ue
him to the church of Dumfries; whither; from
con&s;cious guilt, he had fled for refuge; and
puni&s;hed him as his crime de&s;erved. Not the
hou&s;e of GOD, not even the altar; was to be
allowed an a&s;ylum to protect &s;uch infamous
trea&s;on and per&s;idy. He fell indeed by too
honourable hands, as a hangman or common
executioner &s;hould have performed what was
done by the Boyd, the Fleming, and the
Lind&s;ay, on 10th February 1306.</P>
<P>Having no i&s;&s;ue, he was the la&s;t lord of

<P>I. Sir JAMES ELPHINGSTON, third &s;on
of Robert third lord Elphing&s;ton, de&s;igned
of Barnton, was a man of great parts and a|bilities,
and highly e&s;teemed by king James
VI. who con&s;tituted him one of the &s;enators
of the college of ju&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1586, one of
the lords of the trea&s;ury, then called Octa|vians,

and lord pre&s;ident of the &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;oon there|after;
in all which high offices he acquitted

<P>He was al&s;o appointed one of the commi&s;|&s;ioners

which at that time took no effect.</P>
<P>King James, in con&s;ideration of his faith|ful

to him, and his heirs-male, tailzie, and pro|vi&s;ion,
by a charter, under the great &s;eal, dat|ed
the 20th of February 1603.</P>
<P>He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great e&s;tate, which
appears from no le&s;s than nine charters under
the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. inter 1661 &amp; 1609.</NOTE> in the public regi&s;ters; parti|cularly
he purcha&s;ed from Robert Logan of
Re&s;talrig the lands and barony of Re&s;talrig,

Balmerinoch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad annum 1605.</NOTE> <HI>terrarum baroniae de Re&s;talrig,</HI>
dated 16th May 1605.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance of the purcha&s;e of the ba|rony
of Re&s;talrig, evidently di&s;proves a &s;tory,
which has long prevailed with many, that Lo|gan
was forfeited by the king, after he was
dead, for the immediate purpo&s;e of be&s;towing
his lands on his favourite &s;ecretary Balmeri|no;
Logan was not forfeited till the 24th
June 1609: 'Tis plain from the above char|ter,
that Balmerino purcha&s;ed the&s;e lands at
lea&s;t four years before, and it may be further
ob&s;erved, that tho' Logan had once a good
e&s;tate, he appears to have been denuded of
all, and entirely bankrupt &s;ome years before
his death. For,</P>
<P>His lands of Mount Lothan and Nether Go|gar,
were purcha&s;ed by Andrew Logan of
Coatfield, <HI>anno</HI> 1596.</P>

&s;hire of Berwick, were acquired by Archi|bald
Douglas of Pittendreich, <HI>anno</HI> 1602.</P>

true lover of his country.</P>
<P>At the parliament 1706, he oppo&s;ed the

of David carl of Northesk, but died without
i&s;&s;ue, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother,</P>
<P>V. ARTHUR, &s;ixth lord Balmerino, a man
of great honour, courage, and intrepidity.
He was bred to the army, and, in the queen's
time, was captain of a company of foot.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="75">
In 1745 he engaged in the rebellion, and,
after the battle of Culloden, was taken pri&s;o|ner,
carried to London, tried before the
hou&s;e of lords, found guilty of high trea&s;on,
condemned, and beheaded on Towerhill the
18th of Augu&s;t 1746, in the fifty-eight year
of his age, where he behaved with uncom|mon
con&s;tancy and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>As this lord's behaviour was magnanimous
and great, during his confinement, and at his
execution, we &s;hall take the liberty here to
in&s;ert a few pa&s;&s;ages from a paper publi&s;hed,
by the authority of the &s;heriff of London, af|ter
his death.</P>
<P>A little before he was carried to Towerhill,
he demanded an interview with lord Kilmar|nock,
who was in the &s;ame unhappy &s;ituation
with him&s;elf, which was granted: After it
was ended, the two lords &s;aluted one another,
and Balmerino <Q REND="inline">"bid lord Kilmarnock an eternal
happy adieu, and, with a chearful counte|nance,
added, My dear lord, I wi&s;h I could
alone pay the reckoning, and &s;uffer for us
both, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>During the time the &s;caffold was putting
in order for the execution of lord Balmerino,
the &s;heriff, that attended at the fir&s;t exe|cution,
went to Balmerino's apartments, as a
notice to his lord&s;hip that his time was come;
upon who&s;e entrance his lord&s;hip &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;up|po&s;e
lord Kilmarnock is no more;"</Q> and hav|ing
asked how the executioner performed his
duty; upon receiving the account, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Then
it was well done; and now, gentlemen, &s;aid
his lord&s;hip, I will detain you no longer,
for I de&s;ire not to protract my life."</Q> He
then &s;aluted the company, in a manner &s;o
chearful, as drew tears from every eye but
his own, and ha&s;tened to the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>But before we view his lord&s;hip on the
&s;caffold, 'tis but ju&s;t to the memory of that
great, but unhappy man, to acquaint the pu|blic
what was his deportment in his retire|ment
here: 'Twas graceful, without affecta|tion;
chearful, but not pre&s;umptuous: He
conver&s;ed freely with his friends, twice re|fre&s;hed
him&s;elf with a bit of bread and a gla&s;s
of wine, and de&s;ired the company to drink to
him, <HI>Ain degrae ta haiven;</HI> but, above all,
he called frequently upon God, and &s;eemed
both willing and prepared to die.</P>
<P>When he mounted the &s;caffold, he did it with
&s;o undaunted a &s;tep, as &s;urpri&s;ed every &s;pectator
that was unacquainted with the greatne&s;s of his
&s;oul.</P>
<P>He walked round the &s;caffold, bowed to
the people, read the following in&s;cription on
his coffin: <HI>Arthurus dominus de Balmerino, de|collatus</HI>
18 <HI>die Augu&s;ti</HI> 1746, <HI>aetatis &s;uae</HI> 58;
&s;aid it was right, and, with &s;eeming plea|&s;ure,
looked on the block, which he called
his pillow of re&s;t.</P>
<P>He then called for the executioner, who,
being introduced to him, was about to ask
his forgivene&s;s; but my lord &s;topt him, and
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Friend, you need not ask me forgive|ne&s;s,
the execution of your duty is com|mendable;"</Q>
then pre&s;enting the executio|ner
with three guineas, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Friend, I never
had much money; this is all I have; I wi&s;h
it was more for your &s;ake, and am &s;orry I
can add nothing el&s;e to it but my coat and
wai&s;tcoat,"</Q> which he in&s;tantly took off, and
placed on his coffin for the executioner. Hav|ing
prepared him&s;elf for the block, he took
his la&s;t farewel of them; and, having once
more taken a view of the great number of
&s;pectators, his lord&s;hip &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid
there are &s;ome who may think my behavi|our
bold;"</Q> and, &s;peaking to a gentleman
near him, added, <Q REND="inline">"Remember, &s;ir, what I
tell you; it ari&s;es from a confidence in
God, and a clear con&s;cience."</Q></P>
<P>Then ob&s;erving the executioner with the
ax in his hand, took it from him, and having
felt the edge, return'd it him again, at the &s;ame
time &s;howing him where to &s;trike the blow,
and animating him to do it with re&s;olution,
<Q REND="inline">"For in that, friend, &s;aid he, will con&s;i&s;t your
mercy."</Q></P>
<P>His lord&s;hip then, with the &s;ame &s;urpri&s;ing
countenance, kneeled down at the block, and
having, with his arms extended, &s;aid this &s;hort
prayer, <Q REND="inline">"O Lord, reward my friends, forgive
my enemies, and receive my &s;oul,"</Q> &s;ub|mitted,
and gave the &s;ignal to the executioner.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of Capt. Chalmers,
by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue, whereby the male-line
of this family is extinct.</P>

<P>THE traditional accounts of the origin of

&s;ay, they are de&s;cended of one Andreas, a &s;on

who accompanied queen Margaret from
Hungary to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's ge|nealogical collections, vol. II.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1057, and got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome lands in the &s;outh or we&s;t
parts of this country, and that his po&s;terity
a&s;&s;umed their &s;irname of Borthwick from the
place from whence this Andreas came: Others
are of opinion, that it is a local &s;irname.</P>
<P>It is evident, from our hi&s;tories, that they
were long a great, numerous, and flouri&s;hing
family in Scotland; they had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
in lands; and the noble alliances they made,
by their frequent marriages with the greate&s;t

was the progenitor of this illu&s;trious
family, and from him all the Scots in Scot|land
are de&s;cended.</P>
<P>This Uchtredus was witne&s;s to the foun|dation-charters
of the Abbays of Holyrood|hou&s;e
and Selkirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal|rymple's hi&s;t. coll. p. 225.</NOTE> by king David I. <HI>anno</HI>
1128 and 1130.</P>
<P>The author of the M. S. does not affirm
that this Uchtred had taken Scot for his &s;ir|name;
only, that being the &s;on of a Scot&s;man,
he was de&s;igned filius Scot, to di&s;tingui&s;h him
from other Uchtreds, which was a numerous
chri&s;tian name in Scotland about that time.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>II. RICHARD, who certainly a&s;&s;umed the
&s;irname of Scot, and lived in the reigns of
king Malcolm IV. and king William the lion.</P>
<P>Richardus Scot is witne&s;s to a charter of
Robert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> bi&s;hop of St. Andrews, to the abbacy

the priory of St. Andrews, died <HI>anno</HI> 1158;
&s;o the charter, which has no date, mu&s;t have
been granted in or before that year.</P>
<P>This Richard is &s;aid to have had two &s;ons,
Richard and Michael: which was the elde&s;t
we &s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> carried on the line of this family,
and</P>
<P><HI>Michael</HI> was the undoubted ance&s;tor of the
Scots of Balweary, and had con&s;iderable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions

<P>XX. Lady ANNE SCOT, who, in 1665,
was married to James <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">itzroy duke of Mon|mouth,
elde&s;t natural &s;on of king Charles II.
by Lucy daughter of Richard Walters of Ha|verford,
in the county of Pembroke, E&s;q;
Upon which marriage he took the name of
Scot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Buckcleugh, et chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and they were created duke and dut|che&s;s
of Buckcleugh, by letters patent to
their heirs what&s;oever, dated 20th April
1673.</P>
<P>As the life and fatal end of the duke is
fully &s;et forth in many different hi&s;tories, we
&s;hall here only mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t re|markable
particulars.</P>
<P>He was born at Rotterdam in 1649, and
was bred chiefly at Paris, under the eye of
the queen-mother. He had a fine per&s;on,
and a mo&s;t graceful behaviour, and was a
great favourite of his father, who not only
be&s;towed on him many great and lucrative
po&s;ts, but was in&s;trumental in procuring him
the above marriage, which at that time was
one of the greate&s;t in the kingdom.</P>
<P>He came to England in 1662, was creat|ed
baron of Tyndale, earl of Donca&s;ter, duke
of Monmouth, and knight of the garter in
1663; and the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament he
took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>In 1665, he was made captain of the
the king's life guards of hor&s;e, captain-gene|ral
<PB N="104" REF="113">
of the king's forces, and had many other
in&s;tances of the royal bounty and favour.
His brave and gallant behaviour in the wars
abroad, gained him the reputation of an able
general.</P>
<P>In 1679, there happened an in&s;urrection
in Scotland, after the murder of archbi&s;hop
Sharp, which was rai&s;ed by the presbyteri|ans,
in hopes of overturning epi&s;copacy:
The duke had the command of the king's
troops, and fought and defeated the rebels at
Bothwell-bridge, which put an end to that
rebellion.</P>
<P>He afterwards became very popular, e&s;pe|cially
with the di&s;contented party, and tho&s;e
who were again&s;t the duke of York's &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
to the crown, who thought of nothing
le&s;s than making the duke of Monmouth
king; and though the duke had been guilty
of &s;ome very &s;u&s;picious practices, yet, upon
his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the king was plea&s;ed to par|don
him.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter, being again bani&s;h|ed
the court, he retired to Holland, where he
&s;tayed till the king's death in 1684.</P>
<P>In May 1685, being per&s;uaded to attempt
the crown, he invaded the country, from
Holland, with &s;even or eight hundred officers
and men; landed at Lyme in Dor&s;et&s;hire;
and emitted a manife&s;to or declaration, &s;et|ing
forth, <Q REND="inline">"That he came in defence of the
prote&s;tant religion, the laws, rights, and
privileges of England, and invited all
people to join him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The king, being informed of all the&s;e pro|ceedings,
acquainted his parliament; where|upon
both hou&s;es voted an addre&s;s of thanks
to his maje&s;ty, and the commons ordered in
a bill to attaint the duke of high trea&s;on,
which pa&s;&s;ed accordingly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, great numbers of people
flocked into his army from all hands, and at
Bridgewater, and other places, he was pro|claimed
king.</P>
<P>The earl of Fever&s;ham commanded the
king's troops, which were then encamped at
Sedge-muir. On the 6th July, at four in
the morning, the duke, with his army,
thought fit to attack him; but they being
upon their guard, gave them &s;uch a warm
reception, that the duke's army was entire|ly
routed, and him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>He was beheaded on Tower-hill the 15th
July 1685, leaving i&s;&s;ue by the &s;aid dutche&s;s
of Buckcleugh, four &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of Donca&s;ter, born in 1672,
and died young.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> born in 1674, who, after his
father's attainder, was called earl of Dalkeith,
and carried on the line of this family.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Henry,</HI> born in 1676, created earl of
Deloraine.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Francis,</HI> born in 1678, and died young.</P>

Buckcleugh, in May 1688, married to Charles
lord Cornwallis, by whom &s;he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> who died young,&mdash;and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who al&s;o died young.</P>

duke of Monmouth, and dutche&s;s of Buck|cleugh,

of Laurence earl of Roche&s;ter, by whom he
had three &s;ons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Francis,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> who died young.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Henry,</HI> who al&s;o died young.</P>
<P>His daughters, lady <HI>Anne</HI> and lady <HI>Char|lotte,</HI>
died unmarried.</P>
<P>He was made knight of the thi&s;tle in 1703,
and dying in 1704, was &s;ucceeded by his
&s;on,</P>
<P>XXII. FRANCIS, earl of Dalkeith, who
was made knight of the thi&s;tle in 1724, and
&s;ucceeded to the honours and title of duke of
Buckcleugh, upon the death of his grandmo|ther
the dutche&s;s, <HI>anno</HI> 1732, and was cho&s;en
one of the &s;ixteen peers for Scotland to the
next <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament.</P>
<P>In 1743, he was re&s;tored to two of the
duke of Monmouth's titles, by act of parlia|ment,
<HI>viz.</HI> earl of Donca&s;ter, and baron Scot
of Tyndale, by which he became a Briti&s;h
peer.</P>
<P>In 1720, he married lady Jane Douglas,
daughter of James duke of Queensberry, by
whom he had two &s;ons and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Francis,</HI> earl of Dalkeith.</P>

<HEAD>DALZIEL Earl of CARNWATH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS noble family is of great antiquity
in the &s;hire of Lanark, where they flou|ri&s;hed,
and matched with &s;everal of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable families, before they &s;ettled in
Dumfries-&s;hire, where they now have their
chief re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that this is a local
&s;irname,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks up|on Ragman's roll, p. 45.</NOTE> and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed by the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors
of the lands and barony of Dalziel; but,</P>
<P>The account of their origin, given by Mr.
Nisbet, and other hi&s;torians, is, that in the
reign of king Kenneth II. a kin&s;man, and fa|vourite
of that king, being taken pri&s;oner by
the Picts, was put to death, and hung up up|on
a gallows in view of the Scotch camp.
King Kenneth being highly provoked and in|cen&s;ed
at the affront, offered a con&s;iderable
reward to any of his &s;ubjects who would take
down, and carry off the corp&s;e; but, for &s;ome
time, none would venture to undertake the
dangerous enterpri&s;e. At la&s;t, a gentleman
of more &s;pirit and courage than the re&s;t, &s;aid
<HI>dal zell,</HI> which, in the old Scotch language,
&s;ignifies, <HI>I dare.</HI> He effectually performed
it to the king's &s;atisfaction, who accordingly
rewarded him nobly. His po&s;terity a&s;&s;umed
the word DALZELL for their &s;irname, and
that remarkable bearing of a man hanging on
a gallows for their arms, with <HI>I dare</HI> for their
motto, in memory of the above brave action,
though they now bear only a naked man pro|per.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great antiquity of
this noble family, the fir&s;t of them we find
upon record is,</P>
<P>I. Sir THOMAS de DALZELL, who was
one of the great barons that &s;wore &s;ealty to
king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col|lect. vol. III. p. 662.</NOTE> of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>

mo&s;t remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for
conduct and bravery, &s;o none appears to have
got &s;o large a &s;hare as this Robert de Bruis;
for both Scotch and Engli&s;h hi&s;torians agree,
that he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle and ma|nor
of Skelton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrom|bie's hi&s;t. Dugdales ba|ronage. Mon. anglic. where mo&s;t of his lands are par|ticularly men|tioned.</NOTE> (which became the chief title

whereof Gysburn in Cleveland, (which we
&s;hall have occa&s;ion often to mention hereaf|ter,)
was one.</P>
<P>This Robert died about the year 1100,

<P>II. ROBET de BRUIS, &s;econd lord of Skel|ton,
a man of great worth and honour, who,
having contracted a friend&s;hip with king
David I. while he re&s;ided in England, and
his lady being then dead, by whom he had a
&s;on and heir, he came to Scotland with Da|vid,
who was a generous prince, and always
conferred his favours upon per&s;ons of merit.</P>
<P>We &s;hall ob&s;erve, that during the reign of
king Alexander I. his brother David was de|&s;igned
<HI>comes,</HI> and prince of Cumberland,
and was &s;uperior of the whole lord&s;hip of An|nandale.
He was al&s;o earl of Northumber|land,
Huntington,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal|rymple's col. p. 168. and 176.</NOTE> and Northampton, in right
of his wife Mathilda, which is fully docu|mented

<P>That Robert de Bruis came to Scotland
with David, and was accounted one of his
nobles or va&s;&s;als, is clear from the &s;aid regi|&s;ter
of Gla&s;gow, where <HI>comes</HI> David gives

of Annandale, of which there are many do|cuments:
and it is affirmed by &s;ome hi&s;tori|ans,
that king David procured him in mari|riage
Agnes Annand, heire&s;s to the rich lord|&s;hip
of Annandale, which contained all the
lands from the bounds of Dunegal and Strath|nith,
to the lands of Ranulph de Me&s;chines,
then earl of Che&s;ter, and lord of Cumber|land,
which king David confirmed to him,
whereby he came to have large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
both in Scotland and in England.</P>
<P>And being a man of great parts, and equal|ly
qualified for the cabinet and the field, was
long in high favour both with king David I.
of Scotland, and king Henry I. of Eng|land.</P>
<P>In the year 1137, Robert, being at the
court of England, king Stephen joined him
in commi&s;&s;ion with Bernard de Baliol, to en|deavour
to di&s;&s;uade or divert king David of
Scotland from his intended inva&s;ion of Eng|land,
for which Robert u&s;ed all his intere&s;t;
but David, either neglecting or de&s;pi&s;ing the
advice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal|rymple and Sir William Dugdale.</NOTE> pur&s;ued his former re&s;olutions, and en|tered
England with a con&s;iderable army. Up|on

&s;it to be eating wheat bread with his mother,

<P>However, the year thereafter a peace was
concluded upon very honourable terms for
Scotland, Northumberland having been de|livered

<P>Soon thereafter he relieved, and entirely
redeemed his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country from the

but as the great actions of this hero are ful|ly

age or country ever produced a man of more

<P>He married, 1&s;t, lady I&s;abel, daughter of

<P>King Robert Bruce died in June 1329,

&s;ucce&s;sful.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb.</NOTE> He retired to France after the
battle of Halidonhill, in 1333, where he re|mained

<P>After his return, he made &s;everal expedi|tions

wounded and taken pri&s;oner, <HI>anno</HI> 1346.</P>
<P>He was detained long in England, though
many treaties were &s;et on foot by his faithful

<P>Upon king Robert's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,

and his actions pointed the future general.</P>
<P>In 1704, he had a company in general
M^cCartney's regiment of foot, and was &s;oon

fitted him for the command of &s;uch an impor|tant

was &s;eized with a dy&s;entery, and died at Do|minica,
one of the leeward i&s;lands, the 20th

<P>Charles lord Cathcart had a head that qua|lified
him to &s;hine in that di&s;tingui&s;hed rank

he had more: He had a heart full of benevo|lence,
good-will, and friend&s;hip for man|kind.</P>

<HEAD>LINDSAY Earl of CRAWFURD.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble and illu&s;trious name of Lind|&s;ay
is of very great antiquity in Scot|land;
but there are many different accounts
of their origin.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, that a man of con&s;iderable rank
and courage, who gave great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
king Kenneth II. in his wars again&s;t the Picts,
about the year 838, was the fir&s;t of the &s;ir|name
of Lind&s;ay in this country.</P>
<P>Sir William Dugdale, in his baronage,
mentions &s;everal con&s;iderable families of the
name of Lind&s;ay in England, in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries; that their &s;irname was
local, and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed by the proprietors
of the lands and manor of Lind&s;ai, in the

<P>Our be&s;t antiquaries therefore are of opi|nion,

Scotland, where he &s;ettled, and had &s;everal
lands be&s;towed upon him by that generous
prince, particularly the lands of Wachopdale,

make a figure in this country, in the reign of
king Alexander I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. &amp; Fordun.</NOTE> who was &s;on of king Mal|colm

<P>But being truly loyal in his heart, and de|te&s;ting

<HEAD>RAMSAY Parl of DALHOTSIE,</HEAD>
<P>ANTIQUARIES do not exactly a|gree
about the origin of the illu&s;tri|ous
name of Ram&s;ay.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that it came origin|ally
from Germany, the armorial bearing be|ing
an eagle di&s;played.</P>
<P>Others, with more probability, &s;ay, from
England; that it is local, and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;um|ed
from the lands and abbacy of Ram&s;ay, in
Nottinghame-&s;hire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Certain it is, the Ram&s;ays were &s;ettled in
this country as early as the reign of king Da|vid
I. who &s;ucceeded to the crown of Scot|land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1124.&mdash;And it appears, from
Rymer's foedaera Angliae, and Prynne's collec|tions,
that there were many con&s;iderable fa|milies
in Scotland of that &s;irname, long be|fore
the reign of king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>It is evident al&s;o from our hi&s;tories and re|cords,
that (be&s;ides the Ram&s;ays in Mid-Lo|thian)
there were many eminent families of
that &s;irname in Fife, Angus, and Perth-&s;hire,
in very early times, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ram&s;ays of Co|luthie,
Carnock, Cor&s;ton, Forthar, Parbroath,
Auchterhou&s;e, Balmain, Banff, and many o|thers,
&s;ome whereof have been hereditary
&s;heriffs of Angus, &s;heriffs of Fife, Edinburgh,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have enjoyed the highe&s;t offices in
the &s;tate; but whether they are all de&s;cend|ed

and great, there is no &s;ubject can
plead a higher claim than the Douglas; but
it is the lea&s;t part of the glory of this fami|ly,
that it has been honoured with alliances
by marriage into the fir&s;t rank of nobility in
Scotland, England, and France, even with
crowned heads, having matched eleven times
with the royal hou&s;e of Scotland, and once
with that of England.</P>
<P>That, be&s;ides the honours conferred on
them by their own &s;overeigns, they have
been dukes of Turenne, counts of Longue|ville,
and mari&s;hals of France; they were
more di&s;tingui&s;hed by their virtue and merit,

glory that have made this family renowned
through all the corners of Europe, for which
we mu&s;t refer to our hi&s;torians, as our bu&s;i|ne&s;s
is more properly genealogy than biogra|phy.</P>
<P>The traditional account of the origin of
this noble family, tran&s;mitted to us by hi&s;to|rians,
is,</P>
<P>About the year of God 770, in the reign
of Solvathius king of the Scots, one Donald
Bane, of the we&s;tern i&s;les, having invaded
the Scotch territories, and routed the royal

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, great &s;uperiorities, and an incre|dible
number of va&s;&s;als and followers; &s;o that
he was envied by &s;ome, and dreaded by o|thers.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 254.</NOTE> he was long in great favour
with king James II. was one of his privy
council in 1444, and lord lieutenant of the
kingdom. He had the di&s;po&s;al of all offices
and places of tru&s;t till 1449, that the king
took the management into his own hands;
and in that year he was appointed one of the
guarantees of a treaty with the Engli&s;h; but
upon &s;ome changes happening at court, he
laid down all his employments, and retired
to the country, where, 'tis &s;aid, he lived
more like a &s;overeign prince than a &s;ubject,
which gave great offence to the king and mi|ni&s;try.
But it &s;eems he was con&s;cious to
him&s;elf of no ill intentions; and, apprehend|ing
no danger, he went to Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, p. 515.</NOTE> accompani|ed
with a &s;plendid retinue of gentlemen of
the fir&s;t rank, <HI>anno</HI> 1450, being the year of
the Jubilee.</P>
<P>The enemies of his family, who had been
accomplices in the murder of his cou&s;ins, be|ing
jealous of his power, and afraid of his re|turn,
endeavoured to in&s;til bad notions, of him
into the mind of the king, and got &s;everal

<P>The earl being informed of what was do|ing
again&s;t him, thought proper to make the
be&s;t of his way home. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his grand
retinue, and, pa&s;&s;ing through England incog.

of obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 315.</NOTE> The king ac|cepted
it mo&s;t graciou&s;ly, received him kind|ly,
and he got again greatly into his maje&s;ty's
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">avour.</P>
<P>In April 1451,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. tom. II. page 285.</NOTE> he was one of the amba&s;|&s;adors
&s;ent to England, to confer and make
<PB N="188" REF="199">
up the differences about the breaches of the
late truce.</P>
<P>After which, having been guilty of &s;ome
arbitrary proceedings in his own country, he
went to the court of England, where king
James was informed he had been engaged in
&s;ome trea&s;onable practices.</P>
<P>Upon his return he was ordered to attend
the king at Stirling; but, knowing he had
many enemies at court, refu&s;ed to come with|out
a &s;afe conduct, which the king granted
him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and mo&s;t ample
form.</P>
<P>He went to Stirling accordingly, was in|troduced
to the king, who retired with him
into a clo&s;et, where they had a long confe|rence
by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Doctor Abercrombie acknowledges he an|&s;wered
the king dutifully and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie vol. II. p. 354.</NOTE> to
all the points in&s;i&s;ted on, till he de&s;ired
him to cancell and give up a trea&s;onable
league or a&s;&s;ociation entered into by him, the
earl of Crawford, and others of the nobility:</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That that bond or contract
was not in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the time: that it
contained no trea&s;on; and that he could not
give it up without the con&s;ent of his a&s;&s;oci|ates.
The king being incen&s;ed at his refu&s;al,
and not able to bear &s;uch di&s;obedience in a
&s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi|&s;torians agree in this fact.</NOTE> drew out a dagger, and &s;tabbed the earl
to the heart, of which he died in&s;tantly, 2d
February <HI>anno</HI> 1452.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his brother,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, ninth earl of Douglas, and
&s;ixth duke of Turenne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who, in re&s;ent|ment
of his brother's &s;laughter, took up arms
again&s;t his lawful &s;overeign, and &s;oon got to|gether
a far greater army than the king was
able to rai&s;e in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace; but how they
were di&s;per&s;ed at that time, our authors give
no account.</P>
<P>It is alledged by mo&s;t of our hi&s;torians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boethius, Buchanan, Hauthornden Home, Craw|furd, &amp;c.</NOTE>
that this rebellion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without intermi&s;|&s;ion
till it was entirely extingui&s;hed <HI>anno</HI> 1455;
but as this appears to be a mi&s;take, we beg
leave here to in&s;ert &s;ome unque&s;tionable do|cuments,
which we &s;ubmit to the judgment
of our readers.</P>
<P>Earl James's rebellion certainly broke out
in the end of February 1452; yet we find
this earl not only reconciled to the king, but
employed in public negotiations of &s;tate the
very year after the rebellion commenced.

<P>As to what acts of trea&s;on the Dougla&s;es
committed in England about this period, our

guilty; for a good author &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That while

<P>It is mo&s;t certain that the earl, immediate|ly
upon his return to Scotland, commenced a
new rebellion, and began to rai&s;e forces a|gain&s;t
the king. He &s;oon found him&s;elf a|gain
at the head of an army &s;uperior in num|ber
to his maje&s;ty's. He went in que&s;t of
the royal troops, and overtook them near A|bercorn,
where the two armies encamped in
&s;ight of one another; but it &s;eems the &s;eeds
of loyalty &s;till took place in the earl's brea&s;t,
or he was unwilling to &s;pill the blood of his
fellow-&s;ubjects; for certain it is he declined
fighting, at lea&s;t was not &s;o forward to en|gage
the royal army as was expected on &s;o fa|vourable
an opportunity; on which account
lord Hamilton, and &s;ome of the chiefs of his
followers, not only openly upbraided him, but
that very night de&s;erted him; went over to
the king's party; were brought before his
maje&s;ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and God&s;craft.</NOTE> who graciou&s;ly received them, ac|cepted
their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and pardoned them;
whereby the royal army daily encrea&s;ed, and
the rebels dimini&s;hed, which the king per|ceiving,
for &s;ome time avoided coming to
blows.</P>
<P>The earl of Angus, a faithful and loyal
&s;ubject, who dete&s;ted his cou&s;in's rebellion,
was the king's lieutenant, and commander in
chief of the royal army, finding him&s;elf at
la&s;t able to encounter the rebels, gave them
battle at Ancrum-muir, and entirely routed
them, <HI>anno</HI> 1455.</P>
<P>The earl of Douglas's brother, the earl of
Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie and Fordun, vol. II. p. 515.</NOTE> was killed on the &s;pot, his brothers,
the earl of Ormond, and lord Balveny, were
taken pri&s;oners, and both beheaded.</P>
<P>The earl him&s;elf made his e&s;cape to Eng|land,
where he remained long; and as all
his e&s;tates and honours were forfeited to the
crown, his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed &s;oon after|wards
to be&s;tow the whole lands and lord&s;hip
of Douglas upon the earl of Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in archiv. fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. de Douglas. ad ann. 1457.</NOTE> his cou|&s;in

his king and country great di&s;turbance and
trouble; at la&s;t the duke of Albany and he,
having got a&s;&s;i&s;tance from king Henry, invad|ed
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1483.</P>
<P>The old earl was taken pri&s;oner, and
brought into the king's pre&s;ence, who, out of
his great goodne&s;s and lenity, pardoned his
rebellion, and gave him his life.</P>
<P>He retired to the abbacy of Lindores, where
he became a religious and &s;incere penitent,
and continued a mo&s;t faithful and loyal &s;ub|ject,
as long as he lived. When the mal|contents
took up arms in the end of king
James the III's reign, they knowing the old
earl's great capacity, either for peace or war,
applied to him to join and head them; but
he not only ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to engage with
them, but u&s;ed many arguments to make them
change their mea&s;ures, and return to their
duty; and wrote to all his friends and the
cadets of his family, exhorting them to keep
&s;tedfa&s;t in their loyalty, and to continue in
the king's intere&s;t, which many of them did,

many hard&s;hips, though he afterwards got

April 1488, was the la&s;t earl of Douglas, and
in him ended the fir&s;t branch of this noble

<P>The earl being a man of great experience
and knowledge in military affairs, the king
asked his advice and opinion the day before the
battle of Flowdon, which he gave hone&s;tly,
and with great judgment, and alledged it was
highly imprudent to fight the Engli&s;h at that
time, for which he advanced many &s;trong ar|guments;
but this whole&s;ome council has
been mo&s;t unju&s;tly cen&s;ured by &s;ome hi&s;tori|ans,
as proceeding from cowardice or di&s;loy|alty,
he not being in the action him&s;elf, tho'
it appears from good authority, that nothing
but his great age and infirmities hindered him
from going on with the re&s;t; for his two

<P>He was a man of many noble accompli&s;h|ments;
was highly honoured at foreign courts
in the cour&s;e of his travels, and was made a
knight of St. Michael by king Henry II. of
France.</P>
<P>Immediately upon his return home, he ap|plied
him&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, &s;at
in the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 600.</NOTE> was one of the Scotch

parliament, was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with
&s;ome others to negotiate a peace with Eng|land,
which they happily concluded, <HI>anno</HI> 1528.</P>
<P>He afterwards a&s;&s;umed the &s;ole manage|ment
of all affairs; and, it is &s;aid, kept the
king little better than a pri&s;oner: However,
his maje&s;ty made his e&s;cape from him, went
to Stirling, was joyfully received by the
queen-mother, and was immediately attend|ed,
and congratulated by the chief of the no|bility.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter, the earl of Angus was
turned out of all his employments, was ac|cu&s;ed
of &s;everal mi&s;demeanors, outlawed, and
attainted of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>He retired to England, where he was kind|ly
entertained by king Henry, and remained
there till 1543, that his attainder was repeal|ed
by act of parliament, and he was amply
re&s;tored to all his e&s;tates and honours.</P>
<P>He then returned to Scotland, where he
&s;hewed him&s;elf a true patriot, and afterwards
performed many brave actions in the &s;ervice
of his country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was a zealous promoter of the match
betwixt our young queen and prince Edward
of England, as judging it might put an end
to the great animo&s;ities that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|twixt
the two crowns; but it was &s;o &s;trong|ly
oppo&s;ed by others of the nobility and great
men, that his endeavours proved fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>When the king of England found that the
marriage could not be brought about by fair
means, he invaded Scotland with an army,
under the command of &s;ir Ralph Ivers and
Brian Layton, in hopes of accompli&s;hing it by
force.</P>
<P>The earl of Angus immediately joined the
governor, with a great party of his friends
and followers, to oppo&s;e the enemies of his
country, and the victory obtained over the
Engli&s;h at Ancrum muir, was chiefly a&s;cribed
to this earl's conduct and re&s;olution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> for which
the king of England, his brother-in-law, tax|ed
him with ingratitude; but nothing could
prevent him from doing his duty in defence
of his country.</P>
<P>He commanded the van of the army at the
unfortunate battle of Pinky, where his brave
and gallant brother, &s;ir George, lost his li&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and where the earl behaved him&s;elf with re|markable
courage and intrepidity, though the
Engli&s;h obtained the victory, <HI>anno</HI> 1547.</P>
<P>He was now much in favour at court, and
continued to concur with the queen and go|vernor,
in every mea&s;ure that was for the
good of his country, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>He made a re&s;ignation of his e&s;tate and ho|nours

Lord George Douglas, &s;econd &s;on of the
&s;econd marriage of William fir&s;t marquis of
Douglas, a man of a rare military genius,
was created earl of Dunbarton by king
Charles II. on the 9th March 1675, by pa|tent
to the heirs-male of his body.</P>
<P>In his younger years he went to France,
and was appointed one of the pages of ho|nour
to Lewis XIV. but &s;oon went into the
army, where, for his remarkable good beha|viour,
he ro&s;e gradually to the rank of a ma|jor-general,
was pre&s;ent in mo&s;t of the
&s;ieges and actions betwixt the French and the
confederates, and, by his valour and conduct,
gained immortal honour.</P>
<P>After the treaty of Nimeguen, he was cal|led
over to Britain by king Charles II. and re|&s;ided
mo&s;tly at court during the remainder of
that prince's reign, with whom he was in
great favour.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king James VII. to
the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1685, he was appointed
commander in chief of all the forces in Scot|land;
and, in that &s;tation, went again&s;t Ar|chibald
ninth earl of Argyle, upon his inva&s;i|on
of this country, and &s;oon put an end to
that rebellion, by di&s;per&s;ing the earl's troops,
and taking him&s;elf pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1687, king James revived the order
of St. Andrew, which had lain dormant for
145 years, and the earl of Dunbarton was
elected one of the knights of that mo&s;t noble
order.</P>
<P>He had the command of the Scotch royal
regiment, which then con&s;i&s;ted of 5000 men,
and adhered firmly to the intere&s;t of king
James, as long as he &s;taid in Britain. He
afterwards followed him to France, and died
at St. Germains, <HI>anno</HI> 1692, leaving i&s;&s;ue, by
a &s;i&s;ter of the dutche&s;s of Northumberland, a

&s;ucceeded him. He al&s;o betook him&s;elf to a
military life, and ro&s;e to the degree of a co|lonel
in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In March 1716, he was appointed envoy

<P>ALL our antiquaries agree, that one &s;ir
Alexander Carron, a brave and valiant
knight, was the fir&s;t who enjoyed the &s;irname
of Scrymgeour in Scotland; but our hi&s;tori|ans
differ a little about the aera in which he

a party of them actually be&s;et his palace in

the river Spey, where they were encamp|ed
in a very great body on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The water being then extremely high,
it was thought impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, very
hazardous for the king's troops to pa&s;s:
however, the king being incen&s;ed at the
audaciou&s;ne&s;s of the rebels, and eager to
attack them, though they were far &s;uperi|or
in numbers, gave his &s;tandard to his
tru&s;ty friend &s;ir Alexander Carron, (<HI>quia

upon which the whole body pa&s;&s;ed.
The rebels &s;eeing a royal army &s;o near,
and ready to attack them, were &s;eized with
a panick, took to their heels, and fled with
great precipitation, whereby the king ob|tained
a compleat and ea&s;y victory; but
did not forget to reward the brave and
faithful &s;ir Alexander Carron: he made
him a grant of &s;ome lands, and con&s;tituted
him heretable &s;tandard-bearer to the kings
of Scotland, the office to him and his heirs|male
for ever. He al&s;o gave him the &s;ir|name

<P>He was a man of great honour and integri|ty,

<P>The repre&s;entation therefore certainly de|volved

<P>Yet the duke of Lauderdale had intere&s;t

got a gift of recognition, whereby Kirk|ton

he had fini&s;hed the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies at
the univer&s;ity of St. Andrews, greatly im|proved
his excellent parts, by travelling into
foreign countries; and betaking him&s;elf to a
military life, he &s;oon di&s;covered an uncommon
genius for the art of war.</P>
<P>He was fir&s;t a volunteer in the French &s;er|vice;
but in 1672, he went into that of the
States of Holland, got a cornet's commi&s;&s;ion
in the prince of Orange's guards of hor&s;e, and
eminently &s;ignalized him&s;elf at the battle of
Sene&s;e, where William prince of Orange com|manded
the confederates, and the prince of
Conde the French, in Augu&s;t 1674.&mdash;He
immediately got the command of a troop of
hor&s;e, and &s;erved with great reputation as
long as he &s;tayed in that country.</P>
<P>When he came over to Britain, he had
particular recommendations from the prince
of Orange to king Charles II. and the duke
of York.</P>
<P>The king immediately nominated him cap|tain
of one of the three independent troops,
which were rai&s;ed to bring the di&s;&s;enters in
the we&s;tern counties into a compliance with
the con&s;titution of the church e&s;tabli&s;hed by
law, <HI>anno</HI> 1678; the other two were com|manded
by the earls of Home and Airly.</P>
<P>In 1682, he was appointed &s;heriff of Wig|ton,
in Scotland; and in 1683, his brother
David was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with him.</P>
<P>In 1684, he was con&s;tituted captain of the
royal regiment of hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon king James's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,
in 1685, he was &s;worn of the privy council
to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1686, he was made a
brigadier-general, and had the con&s;tabulary
of Dundee, and barony of Dudhope confer|red
upon him.</P>
<P>When the prince of Orange landed in Eng|land,
he marched again&s;t him at the head of his
regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, king James having fir&s;t made him
a major-general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, p. 117. where the patent printed at large.</NOTE> then rai&s;ed him to the dig|nity

his body; which failing, to his heirs-male

whatever, dated 12th November, the fourth
year of the king's reign.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1689, he came to Scot|land,
and &s;at in the convention of e&s;tates, till
he &s;aw a great majority were for forfeiting king
James; and having got private information,
that the mob had a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him,
he made a complaint to the hou&s;e; but it not
being regarded, and ju&s;tice denyed him, he
thought proper to retire to his hou&s;e in the
country, whereupon the convention voted him
an intercommun'd per&s;on, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger
to require him to appear before them at Edin|burgh;
but his lord&s;hip did not think it &s;afe
to comply; upon which they &s;ent a party to
apprehend him. This forced him to go to
the Highlands for refuge, where, by king
James's authority, he rai&s;ed about 15 or
1600 of the clans, and being joined by about
300 Iri&s;h, under the command of colonel Ca|non,
he was marching &s;outh with his little ar|my,
when he was informed that general Mac-Kay
was marching again&s;t him, with more
than double his number of regulars.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July 1689, they met,
and fought at Killicrankie in Athole, where
the Highlanders obtained the victory, tho'
their brave general lo&s;t his life in the action.</P>
<P>By Jean his wife, daughter of William
lord Cochran; &s;on and heir of William, fir&s;t
earl of Dundonald, he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who died an infant.</P>
<P>And leaving no other i&s;&s;ue, the honours
devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>Mr. DAVID GRAHAM, &s;econd vi&s;count
of Dundee; who, having been with his bro|ther
at the battle of Killicrankie, was out|lawed
and forfeited, <HI>anno</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>He followed king James to France, and
was made knight of the order of St. Andrew
at St. Germains, <HI>anno</HI> 1692. But dying
without i&s;&s;ue <HI>anno</HI> 1700, the e&s;tate aud ho|nours,
had it not been for the forfeiture,
would have devolved upon</P>
<P>William Graham of Duntroon, his cou&s;in|german

Walter before-mentioned.</P>
<P>The po&s;terity of William of Duntroon are

<P>In the beginning of the troubles in king

and loyal &s;ubject, was tru&s;ted by his maje&s;ty,
and continued &s;teady in the intere&s;t of the
royal family ever after.</P>
<P>When he was commi&s;&s;ioner to the gene|ral
a&s;&s;embly, he behaved with great prudence
and moderation, and endeavoured all he could
to bring the people to a true &s;en&s;e of their
duty.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he retired
to the country, and lived privately all the
time of the u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>But, upon the fir&s;t appearance of a re&s;to|ration,
none was more zealous and forward
in expre&s;&s;ing their loyalty, and contributing
their utmo&s;t endeavours to bring it about;
of which king Charles II. was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that
he appointed him one of the lords of his pri|vy
council, immediately after his re&s;toration.</P>
<P>Upon the death of William earl Mari&s;hal,
he was appointed lord privy &s;eal, <HI>anno</HI> 1671.</P>

a man of great loyalty, honour and probity,
who, being bred in the army, was engaged
in &s;everal memorable expeditions, in the &s;er|vice
of the States of Holland, where he al|ways
behaved with remarkable conduct and
re&s;olution; but, upon his brother's death, he
quitted the &s;ervice, and returned home, where
he lived in great &s;plendor and magnificence,
till the revolution in 1688; but being &s;in|cerely
attached to the intere&s;t of king James
VII. never de&s;erted or for&s;ook him in his
greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When lord Dundee declared for king
James, and began to rai&s;e the Highlanders for
his &s;ervice, he immediately joined him with
a troop of hor&s;e, and fought on their head at
the battle of Killicranky, where he behaved
with the courage and conduct becoming &s;o ex|perienced
an officer, for which he was outlaw|ed

Hugh, the fifth earl of Eglington's body,
whereby the e&s;tates and honours of Egling|ton

<P>THE traditional account of the origin of
this ancient family, is, that one Peter
d'Aelphing&s;tone, a noble Hungarian, came to
Scotland with queen Margaret, got &s;ome lands
in Mid Lothian from king Malcolm Canmore,
which he called after his own name, and that
from him all the Elphin&s;tones in Scotland
are de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Others, with more probability, think that
the &s;irname is local; that the&s;e lands had the
name of Elphin&s;tone long before &s;irnames
were much u&s;ed in Scotland; and that the
proprietors of that barony a&s;&s;umed their &s;ir|name
from their lands, as was very cu&s;tom|ary
in tho&s;e early times.</P>
<P>The immediate ance&s;tor of this noble fa|mily,

<HEAD>HAY Earl of ERROL.</HEAD>
<P>THE grandeur and antiquity of the great
and illu&s;trious name of HAY being &s;uf|ficiently
&s;et forth, and atte&s;ted both by anci|ent
and modern hi&s;torians, we &s;hall only hint
briefly at the traditional account of their ori|gin,
as it is handed down to us by many emi|nent
authors.</P>
<P>In the reign of king Kenneth III. the Danes
having invaded Scotland, about the year 980,
with a great and numerous army, were op|po&s;ed
by king Kenneth, who gave them battle
near Loncartie, in Perth&s;hire, where the Scots
were wor&s;ted and fled.</P>
<P>In their flight through a narrow pa&s;s, they
were met by a brave Scot&s;man, and his
two &s;ons, who were labouring their ground
near by; they &s;topt them, encouraged them
to rally, telling them it was better and more
honourable to die in the field, fighting for
their king and their country, than to fly, and
afterwards be killed by the mercile&s;s Danes:
by thus upbraiding their cowardice, they
were prevailed upon to &s;top.</P>
<P>There were many gallant men among&s;t them,
who fled more from the de&s;ertion of their com|panions,
than want of courage They join|ed
the brave old man and his &s;ons, &s;topt all
the flyers, and &s;oon got a con&s;iderable body
of men together.</P>
<P>The father and his &s;ons having only &s;uch
arms as their ploughs furni&s;hed them with,
led back their countrymen, who returned to
the charge. They renewed the fight, fell
upon the Danes, and made a mo&s;t furious on|&s;et,
crying aloud, Help is at hand. The Danes
believing that a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;h army had fallen on
them, &s;oon gave way, whereby the Scots
obtained a compleat victory, and effectually
freed their country from &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>The battle being over, the old man (after|wards
known by the name of Hay,) was
brought to the king, who gave him and his
&s;ons, as a ju&s;t reward of their valour and me|rit,
&s;o much land on the &s;ide of the river
Tay, in the Car&s;e of Gowrie, as a falcon, &s;et
off a man's hand, &s;hould fly over before &s;he
&s;ettled. She flew over about &s;ix miles of
ground in length, which was afterwards cal|led
Errol, and has been the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and
chief title of the Hays their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The king further promoted them to the
order of the nobility, and a&s;&s;igned them a
coat of arms, <HI>viz. argent,</HI> three &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tcheons,
<HI>gules,</HI> to intimate that the father and the two
&s;ons had been the three fortunate &s;hields of
Scotland.</P>
<P>Thus all ancient Scotch authors: But</P>
<P>It appears from many hi&s;tories, that there
were families of the name of Hay, both in
Italy and France, even before the aera of the
battle of Loncarty. The late counte&s;s of Er|rol,
as head or chief of the Hays in Scotland,
had &s;ome time ago a mo&s;t elegant letter from
the learned&mdash;Hay, archbi&s;hop of Marnis,
wherein he mentions the above account of
the battle of Loncarty, as a piece of hi&s;tory
contained in the memoirs of the Hays in I|taly;
but &s;ays, that the fir&s;t of the Hays in
Scotland and Italy came both from Armenia.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other probable accounts
of the origin of this noble family, with which
we &s;hall not trouble our readers here, but re|fer
to title, marquis of Tweeddale.</P>
<P>In the genealogical account of the family
of Errol, it is &s;aid, that the name of the brave
old man, at the battle of Loncarty, was Tho|mas,
afterwards &s;irnamed Hay; that the name
of his elde&s;t &s;on was Sereld Hay; and the name
of his &s;econd Achaius. The&s;e are &s;aid to be
the fir&s;t of the name of Hay in Scotland, and
the ance&s;tors of the Hays of Errol; but as we
have no authentic documents for the next
three or four generations, we &s;hall begin to
deduce the de&s;cent of this noble family from
certain authority, <HI>viz,</HI> original charters, and
our public records.</P>

<L>By John Duke of Marlborough;</L>
<L>The hero not only of his nation, but his age;</L>

<L>Who, by wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, candour, and addre&s;s,</L>

<P>Philip, a grand&s;on of the hou&s;e of France, united to
the intere&s;ts, directed by the policy, &s;upported by the

King William III. beheld this formidable union of two
great, and once rival, monarchies. At the end of a
life &s;pent in defending the liberties of Europe, he &s;aw
them in their greate&s;t danger. He provided for their &s;e|curity

<P>He got al&s;o a charter, whereby the lands
and baronies of Finlater, Deskford, Kethmore,

numerous to be here in&s;erted, with the fi&s;h|ings

<P>He married, 2dly, Elizabeth Gordon, &s;i&s;ter

<P>By her he had only one daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Margaret Ogilvie,</HI> married to John Gor|don,
third &s;on of Alexander earl of Huntly,
upon whom, by evil coun&s;el, and the in&s;tiga|tion
of his wife, he was prevailed upon to
&s;ettle his whole e&s;tates of Deskford, Finlater,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in prejudice of his &s;on James of Cardell,
the &s;aid John Gordon being obliged to carry
the name and arms of Ogilvie. The &s;ub&s;titu|tion
runs thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"To him&s;elf and Elizabeth

Ogilvie of Boyne; then to Walter of
Dunlugas; then to lord Ogilvie, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI>

<P>John Gordon having been engaged at the
battle of Corrichie, where his father was kil|led,
<HI>anno</HI> 1562, was beheaded at Aberdeen,
and &s;orfeited; the e&s;tates of Deskford, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were thereupon claimed by the Gordons, in
virtue of the deed of &s;ettlement of Alexander
abovementioned; but queen Mary, out of her
great goodne&s;s and love to ju&s;tice, re&s;tored
the whole e&s;tate to James Ogilvie of Cardell,
the rightful owner, and confirmed it to him
by a charter under the great &s;eal, as will be
&s;hown hereafter.</P>
<P>V. JAMES OGILVIE of Cardell, though
deprived as above of the family e&s;tate, in his
father's lifetime, got the baronies of Broad|lands,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Inverne&s;s-&s;hire; upon which he
got a charter under the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"to James
Ogilvie, &s;on and apparent heir of Alexander
Ogilvie of that ilk, and Janet Gordon his
&s;pou&s;e, dated 16th February 1534."</Q></P>
<P>Upon the death of John Gordon, as a|bove
mentioned, this James of Cardell, who
then &s;erved queen Mary as &s;teward of her
hou&s;hold, came over from France to recover
the e&s;tate, which belonged to him by birth|right,
but was now claimed by the Gordons,
as before mentioned. At this time there ap|pears
to have been a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to queen Ma|ry
of Lorrain, then regent, who pronounced
a decreet-arbitral betwixt the parties. This
decreet-arbitral is not now to be found; but
it is mentioned in the &s;econd decreet-arbitral
which re&s;tored the e&s;tate to the right owner.
This fir&s;t decreet-arbitral, it would appear,
was unfavourable for James of Cardell, who,
upon queen Mary's coming over from France,
rai&s;ed a reduction thereof in the courts of
law. The&s;e proceedings cau&s;ed great animo|&s;ities
betwixt the families of Gordon and O|gilvie,
in which the friends of both were
mo&s;tly embarked. To this was owing the
&s;cuffle that happened in the &s;treets of Edin|burgh
betwixt John Gordon and the above
James, who is there de&s;igned lord Ogilvie of
Airly, mentioned in Robert&s;on's hi&s;tory, vol.
I. page 245.</P>
<P>When queen Mary made her progre&s;s in|to
the north country, &s;he was attended by
James of Cardell, who was extremely active
and in&s;trumental in bringing the MacInto&s;hes,
and others of his friends, as well as the Ogil|vies
from Angus, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 8th February 1563, queen Mary,
out of her regard to James of Cardell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> grant|ed
him a charter, under the great &s;eal, of the
lands and baronies of Deskford, Finlater, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"to James Ogilvie of Cardell, &s;on and heir
of Alexander Ogilvie of that ilk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this charter, it &s;eems the
Gordons &s;till claimed part of the Ogilvies
lands; but at la&s;t all differences between the
families were ended by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
following per&s;ons, arbiters, <HI>viz.</HI> James earl of
<PB N="262" REF="273">
Bothwell, and &s;ir John Ballenden, ju&s;tice|clerk,
on the part of the earl of Huntly, James
and Adam Gordons, his brothers, and William
Maitlend, younger of Leithington, and Mr.
John Spence, his maje&s;ty's advocate, for James
Ogilvie, the queen being overs-woman; and
by their decreet-arbitral, which is dated 23d
March 1566, the lands and barony of Desk|ford,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Decreet. arbi|tral penes co|mitem de Fin|later.</NOTE> as contained in the above charter,

<P>The lands and &s;uperiorities in Strathearn
and Strathnaven, and the other lands in the
&s;hires of Nairn and Inverne&s;s, had been &s;eiz|ed
by the Gordons, at the &s;ame time that
they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t of the e&s;tate
of this family. The&s;e lands and &s;uperiorities
came &s;oon thereafter into the hands of the
regent, earl of Murray, and have been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by that family ever &s;ince; but there is

was &s;ettled under king William, he

earl of Tullibardine, afterwards duke of A|thole,
who having re&s;igned, he acted as &s;ole
&s;ecretary until lord Carmichael was joined

<P>In the year 1698, he was appointed pre|&s;ident

and he was at the &s;ame time created vi&s;count

remarkably di&s;played his eloquence, and great
abilities in the law, and a peculiar talent of

cautionry, and other incidents, &s;o low as to

<P>THAT this noble and ancient family
hath flouri&s;hed in Scotland above five
hundred years, appears both from our hi&s;to|ries
and records, though &s;ome traditional ac|counts
deduce their origin and de&s;cent much
higher.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin of Clermont, a learned and ju|dicious
antiquary, &s;ays, that one Solvathius
Forbes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's gen. collect. v. II. p. 17.</NOTE> married Moravilla, daughter of king
Gregory the great, about the year 870, and
that all the Forbes's in Scotland are de&s;cend|ed
of him.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="277">
Other hi&s;torians &s;ay, that one Achonacher,
a man of rank, who came from Ireland, hav|ing
killed a mon&s;trous wild boar, took the
name of For-bear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 327.</NOTE> which was afterwards turn|ed
to Forbeas; that he was ance&s;tor of the
Forbes's, and that they took the boar's head
for their armorial bearing, in memory of their
having killed the boar.</P>
<P>Cambden &s;ays, that one of the name of
Bois, in king John Baliol's time, after kil|ing
a mighty wild boar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd. fol. edit. p. 712.</NOTE> was called For-bois,
which afterwards was turned to Forbes; but
this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take, (at lea&s;t as to the
aera,) for there were Forbes's in Scotland long
before that time.</P>
<P>It is alledged by others, with more probabi|lity,
that Forbes is a local &s;irname, and was fir&s;t
taken up by the proprietors of the lands and
barony of Forbes, &s;oon after the reign of king
Malcolm Canmore, about which time &s;everal
men of rank in Scotland a&s;&s;umed their &s;ir|names
from the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and were
progenitors of &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
families in the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>MACDUFF Thane and Earl of FYFE.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are many full and elaborate ac|counts
of this great and antient fami|ly,
wrote by good hi&s;torians, we &s;hall here
briefly deduce their de&s;cent from the be&s;t au|thorities.</P>
<P>Fifus Duffus, or Fyfe MacDuff, was a
man of va&s;t wealth and power in the reign of
king Kenneth II. and gave that prince great
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his wars with the Picts, about
the year 834.</P>
<P>After they were &s;ubdued (about the year
840) king Kenneth gave to this MacDuff, in
reward of his great and eminent &s;ervices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Bal|four's de&s;crip|tion of Fife.</NOTE> all
the lands then called Otholinia, which he
him&s;elf had conquered from the Picts, which
extended from Fife-Ne&s;s to Clackmannan,
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from the river Forth on
the &s;outh, to the river Tay and Earn on the
north.</P>
<P>This great tract of land he called Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e, af|ter
his own name, according to the&s;e words
of Boethius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boeth. lib. X. p. 199.</NOTE> <HI>regio ad id tempus Otholinia a
Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o Duffo, in Fifi nomen conce&s;&s;it, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As he was now proprietor of all Fyfe, he
was al&s;o appointed heretable thane thereof,
the highe&s;t juri&s;diction then known in Scot|land
under our kings; which dignity was en|joyed
by his po&s;terity in a direct male-line to
that hero and eminent patriot MacDuff, the
eighth thane, and fir&s;t earl.</P>
<P>I. MACDUFF, eighth thane, afterwards
earl of Fyfe, was one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t
powerful &s;ubjects in the kingdom; and as he
was no le&s;s good than great, he was con&s;e|quently
much dreaded by MacBeath the u&s;ur|per.</P>
<P>The great &s;hare he had in bringing about
king Malcolm Canmore's re&s;toration, and his
killing MacBeath with his own hand, are facts
&s;o well known, that it is needle&s;s here to in|&s;i&s;t
on them.</P>
<P>And as Malcolm was a prince both gene|rous
and grateful, he did not fail to reward
his benefactor according to his merit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. I.</NOTE> He
confirmed to him the county of Fyfe, and cre|ated
him earl thereof at his fir&s;t <HI>conventus pro|cerum</HI>
held at Forfar, <HI>anno</HI> 1057; or, accord|ing
to others, <HI>anno</HI> 1061.</P>
<P>He likeways conferred on him many great
and noble privileges, all to de&s;cend to his po|&s;terity,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1&s;t, To have the honour of placing the
kings of Scotland in the chair of &s;tate at their
coronation.</P>
<P>2d, That they &s;hould lead the van of the
royal army in the day of battle.</P>
<P>3d, That if any within the ninth degree
of relation to his family, &s;hould be guilty of
man-&s;laughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. I. p. 252.</NOTE> he &s;hould be free by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lying to

<P>THIS noble family is of very great anti|quity
in the we&s;t of Scotland, but our
antiquaries are not agreed about their origin.</P>
<P>Frederic Van Ba&s;&s;en, a learned Norvegi|an,
who wrote an account of the origin of
&s;everal Scotch families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. in the advocate's library, Edr.</NOTE> &s;ays, that one Mal|colm
&s;on of Friskin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted Malcolm prince
of Scotland, (afterwards king Malcolm Can|more)
to make his e&s;cape from the tyranny
of Macbeath, who had murthered his father
king Duncan; and, being hotly pur&s;ued, he
took &s;helter in a barn, where Malcolm con|cealed
the prince, by forking &s;traw or hay
over him. The pur&s;uit being over, the prince
made his e&s;cape to England, accompanied by
his faithful Malcolm.</P>
<P>Prince Malcolm was no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
of his kingdom, than he rewarded his
pre&s;erver with the Thanedom of Cunning|hame,
from which his po&s;terity a&s;&s;umed their
&s;irname, and took a &s;hake-fork for their arms,
with <HI>Over fork over</HI> for their motto, to per|petuate
the memory of this happy e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Cambden &s;ays, that the Cunninghames
came originally from England, which po&s;&s;i|bly
may be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, fo|lio edition, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">3.</NOTE> for there came &s;everal per&s;ons
of rank from that country to Scotland, with
king Malcolm Canmore, and we find Cun|ninghames
&s;ettled in the &s;hire of Ayr, very
&s;oon thereafter.</P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie is of opinion, that the
&s;irname is local, and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed by the
proprietors of lands in Cunninghame, where
the ance&s;tors of this noble family had great
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in very early times; and having
the office of ma&s;ter of hor&s;e in the king's &s;ta|bles,
took for their armorial figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacKenzie's heraldry.</NOTE> the in|&s;trument

<P>XXI. WILLIAM, ninth earl of Glencairn,
a man of &s;ingular worth and merit.</P>
<P>He was one of the privy council to king
Charles I. from whom he got a ratification
of the titles and honours of Glencairn, as con|ferred
upon his predece&s;&s;or Alexander the fir&s;t
earl, by king James III. his maje&s;ty's <HI>atavus,</HI>
in which all the privileges, dignities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in

<P>He got al&s;o other two charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> under the
great &s;eal, <HI>Willielmo comiti de Glencairn,</HI> of
&s;everal lands.</P>
<P>Though this earl did not appear to act &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
for his maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, in the be|ginning
of his troubles, yet he was far from
engaging on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>In the convention 1643, he joined the
duke of Hamilton, and others, and vigorou&s;|ly
oppo&s;ed the nation's &s;ending an army into
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE> to join the parliament's forces un|der
the obligation of the &s;olemn league and
covenant, for which he had a letter of thanks
under his maje&s;ty's own hand, acknowledging
the &s;ervice he had done him, and a&s;&s;uring him
he never would retract any thing he had grant|ed,
either in religion or liberty, to his &s;ubjects
in Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The original letter is &s;till
pre&s;erved in the family.</P>
<P>Upon the death of &s;ir Thomas Hope of
Car&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he was made ju&s;tice-general, in 1646.</P>
<P>In 1648, he was very zealous in engaging
the nation to endeavour to re&s;cue the king
from his confinement.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned in duke Hamil|ton's
engagement, for which, after the duke's
de&s;eat, the then ruling faction turned him out
of his office of ju&s;tice-general, and conferred
it upon the earl of Ca&s;tilis.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he got a
commi&s;&s;ion from king Charles II. appointing
him general and commander in chief of all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orces he could rai&s;e for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice,
which, upon general Middleton's arrival, he
willingly re&s;igned in his &s;avours.</P>
<P>In 1653, he received a new commi&s;&s;ion
from king Charles II. impowering him to
rai&s;e men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he effectually did, and
gave great unea&s;ine&s;s to general Monk; in
con&s;equence whereof he received a letter un|der
king Charles's own hand from Paris,
which is &s;till pre&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 217. and 218.</NOTE> is very honourable for

<P>We &s;hall only add, that, immediately af|ter
his maje&s;ty's re&s;toration, the earl, in con|&s;ideration
of his many faithful &s;ervices, was
made &s;heriff of Air, and bailie of the &s;tew|arty
of Kyle, in October 1660, and was
con&s;tituted lord high chancellor of Scotland,
on 19th of January 1661, which high of|fice
he exerced with honour and reputation
till he died in July 1664.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, lady Anne Ogilvie, daugh|ter
of James earl of Finlater, by whom he
had four &s;ons, and four daughters.</P>

<HEAD>GORDON Duke of GORDON.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there are many elegant hi|&s;tories
of this ancient and illu&s;trious fa|mily,
written by learned and judicious anti|quaries,
yet they differ greatly as to their
origin and fir&s;t &s;ettlement in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>Some bring them from Greece to Gaul, and
from thence to Scotland, at lea&s;t a thou&s;and
years ago; others bring them from Italy; o|thers
from Spain, Flanders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Certain it is, there were many con&s;ider|able
families of the name of Gordon in
France, long before the Norman conque&s;t of
England, who&s;e po&s;terity we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
to mention hereafter, and who&s;e de&s;cen|dents
are &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in France to this day.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable conjecture therefore is,
that &s;ome of the&s;e Gordons came to England
with William the Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, and
to Scotland with king Malcolm Canmore, or
his &s;on king David I. for it is well known,
that the ance&s;tors of &s;everal of the be&s;t fami|lies
in this kingdom are of Norman extract,
and came to Scotland with one or other of
the&s;e princes.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid, that in the reign of king
Malcolm Canmore, a valiant knight, of the
name of Gordon, came to Scotland, and was
kindly received by that prince; and having
killed a wild boar, which greatly infe&s;ted the
borders, the generous Malcolm gave him a
grant of &s;everal lands in the Mer&s;e, or Ber|wick&s;hire,
which he called Gordon, after his
own &s;irname. He &s;ettled there, took the
boar's head for his armorial bearing, in me|mory
of his having killed that mon&s;trous ani|mal;
that he was progenitor of all the Gor|dons
in Scotland; and mention is made of
Adam de Gordon the father, and Adam his
&s;on, in the reigns of the &s;aid Malcolm and
David.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain the Gordons were mak|ing
no &s;mall figure in Scotland immediately
after that aera; we &s;hall therefore in&s;i&s;t no
more on the hi&s;torial accounts; but proceed
to deduce the de&s;cent of this great and mo&s;t
noble family, by unque&s;tionable authority,
from their immediate ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>I. RICARDUS de GORDON, &s;aid to be
grand&s;on of the knight who killed the boar,
or &s;on of the &s;econd Adam. He was a man
of con&s;iderable di&s;tinction in Scotland in the
reigns of king Malcolm IV. and king William
the Lion, who &s;ucceeded Malcolm, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He was undoubtedly proprietor of the
lands and barony of Gordon, and others, in
Berwick&s;hire, which is in&s;tructed by a dona|tion
he made, <Q REND="inline">"To St. Mary's church of
Kel&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kel&s;o, in the Lawyer's lib|rary, Edin. and printed in the appendix to Mr. Gor|don's hi&s;t. of the family of Gordon.</NOTE> and the monks &s;erving God there,
and to the church of St. Michael in his
village of Gordon, (a bounded piece of his
lands and e&s;tate of Gordon, lying contigu|ous
to the church-yard of Gordon,) in a
free and perpetual alms; and grants to
whatever mini&s;ter they &s;hall place in the
&s;aid church of Gordon, all the ordinary
privileges of pa&s;turage, mo&s;s, muir, and
other conveniencies that the inhabitants of
the lands of Gordon enjoyed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This deed has no date, but by the &s;ub&s;e|quent
confirmations, appears to have been
made <HI>inter</HI> 1150 <HI>et</HI> 1160.</P>
<P>He died about the year 1200, and was &s;uc|ceeded
by his &s;on,</P>
<P>II. Sir THOMAS de GORDON, who, by
his charter, confirms all the donations made
by his father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to God and St. Mary's church
at Kel&s;o, and to the Monks &s;erving God
there, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that in as full, free, and ample
a manner as expre&s;&s;ed in the deeds of his fa|ther;
and he is then de&s;igned <HI>Thomas de
Gordon, filius Ricardi, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Cotemporary with this Thomas, there
flouri&s;hed in France, Bertram de Gordon, who
wounded with an arrow king Richard I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hovedon's hi|&s;tory, p. 791.</NOTE> of
England, before the ca&s;tle of Chalons, of
which he died, <HI>anno</HI> 1199.</P>
<P>About this time lived al&s;o Adam de Gor|don
in Scotland. This appears by a charter
of confirmation, in which Richard bi&s;hop of
St. Andrews confirms to the abbacy of Kel&s;o,
in a free and perpetual alms, the church of
Gordon, with the whole of its pari&s;h, (<HI>viz.</HI>
of Gordon and Spoti&s;wood,) and in which he,
at the de&s;ire of the abbot and monks, point|ed
out a church-yard or burial place to that
pari&s;h;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kel&s;o, and Gordon's ap|pendix.</NOTE> but granting liberty to the inhabi|tants
of the other half of the lands of Gor|don,
belonging to Adam de Gordon, to take
their &s;acrament, and bury either there, or, at
their plea&s;ure, in their mother-church of
Home, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Richard was bi&s;hop of St. Andrews, from
1163 to 1178, &s;o this deed mu&s;t have been
made within that &s;pace.</P>
<P>If this Adam was not a younger &s;on of
Richard, he was certainly a near relation of
the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and chartul. of Cold-&s;tream.</NOTE> &s;eeing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed part of the lord|&s;hip
of Gordon. He is a frequent witne&s;s in

<P>Pontius de Gordon, of a con&s;iderable fa|mily

In a convention with king Henry III. of Eng|land,
this Pontius did homage to king Henry,

Normandy, and for all his other ca&s;tles and lands
which he held of the king of France, and that

of the king of France, for which king Hen|ry
grants him many noble privileges, <HI>anno</HI>

<P>Sir Thomas de Gordon had no male i&s;&s;ue,

<P>IV. ALICIA de GORDON,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Cold&s;tream and Kel&s;o.</NOTE> who, in many

<P>She married her cou&s;in Adam de Gordon,

Adam, proprietor of part of the e&s;tate of Gor|don,
before mentioned; by which marriage
the whole lord&s;hip of Gordon was now uni|ted
in one family.</P>
<P>This Adam mortified to the mona&s;tery of

<P>V. ADAM, de&s;igned <HI>dominus de Gordon,</HI>
&s;ucceeded Adam and Alicia, his father and
mother, and confirms all the donations of his
predece&s;&s;ors to the religious at Kel&s;o.</P>
<P>This Adam appears to have had &s;ome pro|perty
in England, whether his own inheri|tance,
or in right of his wife, who was an
Engli&s;h lady, cannot now be determined;
but in a writ, dated at We&s;tmin&s;ter the 14th
June 1287, he, as a &s;ubject of England, is
ordered to meet Edmund earl of Cornwall,
king Edward's lieutenant, at Gloce&s;ter, in or|der
to give advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in certain
great affairs of &s;tate, which &s;hould be com|municated
at meeting, but whether he obey|ed
the &s;ummons or not is uncertain.</P>
<P>He was always on the Baliols &s;ide, which
probably proceeded both from inclination and
intere&s;t, for mo&s;t of his lands then held of
that prince, or of the earls of March, his fa&s;t
friends; but he died before king John (as
he is then called) re&s;igned the &s;overeign|ty
of Scotland to king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom, II. p. 727.</NOTE> for Mar|jory
his wife obtained a &s;afe conduct from
king Edward to go up to England, and is
then de&s;igned <HI>Uxor quondam Adae de Gordon,
anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>By the &s;aid Marjory, (but of what family
we know not) he left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on and &s;ucce&s;|&s;or,</P>
<P>VI. Sir ADAM de GORDON, <HI>dominus
eju&s;dem,</HI> who was certainly one of the great|e&s;t
men of that age, being equally qualified
for the cabinet and the field.</P>
<P>As all the Gordons in Scotland appear to
be de&s;cended of this &s;ir Adam, and as he is
<PB N="297" REF="310">
variou&s;ly repre&s;ented by different authors,
we &s;hall endeavour to trace his conduct, &s;tep
by &s;tep, from authentic documents, and &s;ubmit
his character to the judgment of our readers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance he makes is, his a&s;&s;i&s;ting
the brave &s;ir William Wallace, then guardian
of Scotland, in his expedition into Galloway,
who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle
of Wigton, gave the keeping of it to &s;ir A|dam,
<HI>anno</HI> 1297.</P>
<P>About that time he acquired the lands of
Glenkenns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv. fam. de Kenmure.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Galloway, which he gave
to his &s;econd &s;on William, as will be &s;hown
hereafter.</P>
<P>He was afterwards appointed warden of the
marches by the guardians of Scotland, in the
ab&s;ence of John Baliol then their king;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> for to
him is intimated, as warden afore&s;aid, a truce
concluded betwixt Scotland and England, at
Dumfries, 30th October 1300.</P>
<P>In 1305, &s;ir Adam, for being along with
John Cummin lord of Badenoch, &s;ometime
guardian of Scotland, is fined by king Edward
of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> then acting as over-lord of Scot|land,
in three years rent of his e&s;tate, for ad|hering
to the Baliol's party.</P>
<P>In 1308, &s;ir Adam de Gordon, John de
Moubray, Alexander de Abernethy, Robert de
Keith, and Henry Haliburton, are &s;ureties for
the good behaviour of William bi&s;hop of St.
Andrews, who&s;e relief out of pri&s;on they had
procured.</P>
<P>About this time &s;ir Adam &s;ettled a difference
that had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, betwixt him and the
abbot and convent of Kel&s;o, whereby he got
liberty to build a chapel for the u&s;e of his fa|mily,
in any place of his pari&s;h of Gordon he
&s;hould think fit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kel&s;o, and Gordon's ap|pendix.</NOTE> he then made a donation to
the church of Kel&s;o, with con&s;ent of Anabel|la
his wife, of a bounded piece of ground on
his lands of Gordon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he is there de|&s;igned
<HI>filius et haeres quondant Adae, &amp;c.</HI> 1308.</P>
<P>In January 1312, David earl of Athole,
&s;ir Adam de Gordon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III. p. 300.</NOTE> and Alexander de Aber|nethy,
are appointed plenipotentiaries by king
Edward, to treat of a peace with king Robert,
which at that time took no effect.</P>
<P>In April 1313, he, with the earl of March,
were &s;ent to England by Baliol's party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to en|deavour
to get &s;ome of their grievances re|dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>And in November thereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he is again
employed by king Edward to negociate a
peace with king Robert, which was the la&s;t
of his actions in favours of the Baliol party. King
John died in 1314, and we find &s;ir Adam e|ver
after, one of king Robert's firme&s;t and
mo&s;t re&s;pected friends.</P>
<P>He obtained from Thomas Randolph, earl
of Murray, a grant of the lands and barony of
Stitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes dom. Rober|tum Pringle de Stitchell.</NOTE> in Roxburgh-&s;hire, which king Ro|bert
ratified and confirmed to him and his &s;on
William, by his charter, dated at Perth, 28th
June 1315.</P>
<P>King Robert knowing &s;ir Adam to be a
man of great abilities, joined him in commi&s;|&s;ion
with &s;ir Edward Odard de Mombui&s;&s;on,
to go to Rome, to manage the affair of his ex|communication
with the pope;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.</NOTE> and they car|ried
with them that famous letter from the
nobility of Scotland to his holine&s;s, a&s;&s;erting
the independency of their country, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>King Robert afterwards, in reward of his
faithful &s;ervices, gave a grant to him and his
heirs, of the noble lord&s;hip of Strabolgie,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Aberdeen-&s;hire, then in the crown
by the forfeiture of David de Strabolgie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> earl
of Athole, which was afterwards confirmed to
his family, by &s;everal charters under the great
&s;eal, as will be &s;hown hereafter.</P>
<P>Sir Adam fixed his re&s;idence there, and
gave the&s;e lands and lord&s;hip the name of
Huntly, which hath been one of the chief
titles of his family ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>By the &s;aid Annabella his wife, he left i&s;|&s;ue
four &s;ons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> to whom he gave the lands
of Glenkenns in Galloway, and Stitchell in
Roxburgh-&s;hire, of whom the family of Ken|mure,
aud &s;everal others in the &s;outh of Scot|land,
are de&s;cended. <HI>Vide</HI> title vi&s;count Kenmure.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t two went into the &s;ervice of the
church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III, p. 396.</NOTE> and obtained letters of recommenda|tion
to the pope, from king Edward of Eng|land,

<P>His daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> was married to &s;ir Walter
Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ro|tul. Rob. 1.</NOTE> ance&s;tor of the duke of Hamilton,

<P>Sir Adam was at la&s;t killed in the &s;ervice
of his king and country, at the battle of Ha|lidon-hill,
<HI>anno</HI> 1333, and was &s;ucceeded by</P>
<P>VII. Sir ALEXANDER GORDON, now de|&s;igned

behaved gallantly at the battle of Halidon|hill,
where his father was killed, though he
had the good fortune to e&s;cape.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. II. p. 98.</NOTE></P>

<P>Immediately after this he &s;urpri&s;ed and took

being in great favour with the king, was no|minated

<P>He accompanied his maje&s;ty to the fatal

again&s;t fighting at that time, where &s;o
many di&s;advantages were obvious, yet when
he found the king was determined, he yield|ed
to his maje&s;ty; and having the command
of the right wing of the army, performed
wonders, and drove all before him that &s;tood
in his way; but the left wing, and the main
body, were not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, being over|powered
with numbers, and the king and the
&s;lower of the nobility being killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromble.</NOTE> he was at
la&s;t obliged to give way, and with great dif|ficulty

<P>XVI. GEORGE, elde&s;t &s;on of John lord
Gordon, &s;ucceeded his grandfather earl Alex|ander,
<HI>anno</HI> 1523, and was fourth earl of
Huntly.</P>
<P>He was a man of a &s;ine genius, and excel|lent
natural parts, which were greatly improv|ed
by a liberal education and travelling.</P>
<P>He got charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> under the great &s;eal, of a
va&s;t number of lands, lord&s;hips and baronies,
<HI>inter</HI> 1530 <HI>et</HI> 1540.</P>
<P>In 1535, the king appointed him one of
his privy council, and al&s;o con&s;tituted him one
of the regency, when he went to France, in
order to e&s;pou&s;e prince&s;s Magdalene, daugh|ter
of king Francis I. The lords regents were
James archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, Gavin
archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, chancellor, George
earl of Huntly, William earl of Montro&s;e,
Hugh earl of Eglington, and Robert lord
Maxwell, who&s;e ample commi&s;&s;ion is fully
narrated in the lives of the officers of &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate, page, 82.</NOTE>
and is dated at Stirling, 29th Augu&s;t 1536.</P>
<P>The king, upon his return, having entire
confidence of the loyalty and fidelity of this
earl, con&s;tituted him lieutenant of the north,
and captain-general of the forces that were
rai&s;ed to oppo&s;e the Engli&s;h under the com|mand
of &s;ir Robert Bowis, whom he pur&s;ued
clo&s;ely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 83.</NOTE> defeated the whole party at Halden|rig,
and took their general pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. then &s;ent a much greater
force to the borders, under the command of
the duke of Norfolk; but the brave earl
of Huntly, by his prudence, dextrous conduct,
and frequent skirmi&s;hes, &s;o hemmed him in,
that he never dur&s;t advance two miles on this
&s;ide of the Tweed.</P>
<P>After the death of the king, the earl of
Huntly was, by act of parliament, appointed
one of the lords of the privy council, to the
earl of Arran, the governor; and upon the
death of Cardinal Bethune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and records of par|liament.</NOTE> he was con&s;titut|ed
lord high chancellor of Scotland: his com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and the great &s;eal were delivered to
him in open parliament on 10th June 1546.</P>
<P>He had a con&s;iderable command at the un|fortunate
battle of Pinkie; and though he be|haved
with the utmo&s;t conduct and re&s;oluti|on,
was taken pri&s;oner, and &s;ent to England;
but made his e&s;cape from Morpeth about one
year thereafter, returned immediately to Scot|land,
and went directly upon the admini&s;tra|tion
of the chancellor's office.</P>
<P>He always &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the match
betwixt queen Mary and the prince of Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and accompanied the queen dowager to
France, when &s;he went to vi&s;it her daughter;
was made a knight of the antient order of St.
Michael by king Francis I. and upon his return,
had a grant of the earldom of Murray, then
in the crown, by the death of earl James, the
queen's natural uncle.</P>
<P>When the queen dowager was made re|gent,
&s;he gave the great &s;eal to Mon&s;ieur
Rubie, a Frenchman; which, upon queen
Mary's return from France, was delivered
back to the chancellor, but her Maje&s;ty was
plea&s;ed to give the earldom of Murray to her
natural brother the prior of St. Andrews, and
created him earl of Murray; between whom
and the chancellor, there was always a mor|tal
enmity.</P>
<P>When the queen went on an expedition to
vi&s;it the northern parts of her dominions, it was
alledged the earl had amind to apprehend her
maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and get her out of the hands
of the earl of Murray;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate. p. 87.</NOTE> he had got together
about 1500 men, but the queen having been
joined by &s;ome MacKenzies, Monros, Fra&s;ers,
and MacInto&s;hes, attacked Huntly near Cor|richie,
where he was de&s;eated, and him&s;elf kill|ed,
<HI>anno</HI> 1562.</P>
<P>His &s;on, &s;ir John, was executed the next
<PB N="301" REF="314">
day at Aberdeen; another of his &s;ons, &s;ir A|dam,
was pardoned; but the earl's e&s;tate and
honours were forfeited to the crown for trea|&s;on,
though her maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to re|ver&s;e
the forfeiture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and records of par|liament.</NOTE> and re&s;tore his &s;on to the
whole e&s;tates, honours, and dignities of the
family, <HI>anno</HI> 1567.</P>
<P>By Elizabeth, daughter of Robert lord
Keith, &s;on and apparent heir of William third
earl Mari&s;hal, he had i&s;&s;ue &s;even &s;ons and three
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> afterwards earl of Huntly.</P>

<P>XVII. GEORGE, fifth earl of Huntly, was
re&s;tored to all his e&s;tates, and honours of his
ance&s;tors, <HI>anno</HI> 1567, as before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Though his forfeiture was not rever&s;ed in
parliament till 1567,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> yet we find him in
great favour with her maje&s;ty before that
time, who appointed him lord high chancel|lor
of the kingdom, on 20th march 1565;
which high office he held till the queen re|&s;igned
the government;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and lives of the officers of &s;tate.</NOTE> then the earl of
Murray conferred it upon his good friend the
earl of Morton.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he adhered to the queen's intere&s;t with great
firmne&s;s and fidelity, and was appointed com|mander
in chief of all the forces rai&s;ed, or
to be rai&s;ed in the north for her maje&s;ty's
&s;ervice. He &s;oon got together a con&s;iderable
body, both of hor&s;e and foot, which gave the
other party a great deal of trouble; but they
being &s;trongly &s;upported by the queen of Eng|land,
Huntly was forced to come to an ac|commodation
with the earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and re|cords of parlt.</NOTE> then
regent, <HI>anno</HI> 1573.</P>
<P>The earl after this retired to his country
feat, where he lived all the re&s;t of his days,
without meddling any more in publick af|fairs.</P>
<P>He married lady Anne Hamilton, daughter
of James duke of Chattelherault, by whom he
had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> his heir,&mdash;and a daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to George earl of
Caithne&s;s.</P>
<P>He died in May 1576, and was &s;ucceeded
by his &s;on,</P>
<P>XVIII. GEORGE, &s;ixth earl of Huntly, who
continuing &s;teady in the Roman catholick re|ligion,
he, the earls of Angus, Errol, and
others, were unju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to have had
&s;ome corre&s;pondence with the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 198 and 305.</NOTE> a|bout
the time of their armado, and of cour&s;e
became obnoxious to the court.</P>
<P>The king was very &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e noble
earls were no enemies, either to him&s;elf or the
country, but were only arming in defence of
their religion and e&s;tates, and was unwilling
to drive them to extremities. The earl of
Bothwell was then in actual rebellion; the
king, therefore, in the beginning of the year
1594,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 247.</NOTE> propo&s;ed that the general a&s;&s;embly
&s;hould order it to be intimate from the pul|pits,
that he was determined to pro&s;ecute, ac|cording
to law, the earl of Bothwell, and all
his rebellious &s;ubjects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The mini&s;ters an&s;wered, and in&s;i&s;ted, that
he &s;hould fir&s;t pro&s;ecute the enemies to God
and religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 248.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the earls of Angus, Huntly,
and Errol, the laird of Strathdon, and &s;ir James
Chi&s;holm, and then pro&s;ecute the traitors and
rebels again&s;t him&s;elf, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There was therefore an army levied, and
&s;ent north again&s;t the&s;e earls, under the com|mand
of Archibald earl of Argyle, the king's
lieutenant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scots hi|&s;torians.</NOTE> They came to an engagement
near Glenlivet; the king's troops were de|feated,
and &s;ome per&s;ons of rank killed on
both &s;ides, in October 1594</P>
<P>However, the earls were &s;oon thereafter
pardoned, and Huntly got &s;o much into the
king's favour, that he obtained from his ma|je&s;ty
a grant of the di&s;&s;olved abbacy of Dun|&s;ermline,
was con&s;tituted lord lieutenant of
the north, and rai&s;ed to the honour of mar|quis
of Huntly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by patent, dated 17th April

<P>This earl, who was truly a great man, had
&s;o many and various &s;cenes of life, that it is
incon&s;i&s;tent with the brevity of this work to
narrate them here, but &s;hall refer our readers
to the lives of the officers of &s;tate, page 383,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> where will be found a full account of his
life and actions. We &s;hall only add, that in
the minority of king James VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hopSpoti&s;|wood.</NOTE> he was char|ged
with &s;everal trea&s;onable practices, for
which he was condemned and executed, on
28th May 1584, and his e&s;tate and honours
forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;um up his character in the words
of a learned author: <Q REND="inline">"He was a nobleman,
<PB N="306" REF="319">
who in his life was much honoured, and

man wi&s;e, but too curious, and &s;aid to have
con&s;ulted with wizards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He made this
common regret, which many great men
have done in &s;uch misfortunes, that if he
had &s;erved God as faithfully as he had done
the king, he had not come to that un|timely
end. His death, to the beholders,
was very peaceable and quiet, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>

<P>XVI. JAMES, elde&s;t &s;on of William, fir&s;t
earl of Gowrie, by the king's great lenity and
goodne&s;s, was re&s;tored to his father's e&s;tate
and honours, and was the &s;econd earl.</P>
<P>He was a youth of great hopes, and of a
&s;weet di&s;po&s;ition; but died unmarried, <HI>anno</HI>
1588, whereby the e&s;tate and honours de|volved
upon his brother,</P>
<P>XVI. JOHN, third earl of Gowrie, who,
with his brother Alexander, made that auda|cious
attempt upon the king's &s;acred per&s;on
at Perth, on the memorable fifth of Augu&s;t
1600, when both the brothers were &s;lain in
the enterprize.</P>
<P>Though there are particular hi&s;tories of
Gowrie's con&s;piracy wrote by &s;everal hi&s;to|rians,
yet we have only hereto &s;ubjoined the
account given by a learned author.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>No tran&s;action in the Scotch hi&s;tory can be &s;o little accounted for, as that of Gowrie's con&s;piracy. A rea&s;on for an attempt &s;o horrid, is &s;carcely &s;o much as hinted; and the methods u&s;ed, even &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch had been the intention, were &s;o prepo&s;terous, that it cannot reconcile, either with the character of the two young gentlemen, or with the other circum&s;tances of the &s;tory it&s;elf. Nature and education had joined in adorning them, e&s;pecially the elder, with the mo&s;t noble accompli&s;hments: More learned than is u&s;ual among per&s;ons of their rank; more religious than is common at their age of life; generous, brave, popular: their country-men, far from thinking them capable of any atrocious crime, conceived the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of their early virtues.</P>
<P>This remarkable incident happened on the fifth Augu&s;t 1600. Hi&s;torians tell us, that as the king was going out in the morning to the chace from his palace of Falkland, he was acco&s;ted by the younger of the two Ruthvens, Alexander, who, with an air of &s;ecrecy and importance, acquainted him, that the evening before, a &s;tranger had been &s;eized near his brother's hou&s;e at Perth, and &s;ecured; and, on &s;earching him, a va&s;t quantity of foreign gold was found upon him. The king immediately &s;u&s;pecting this unknown per&s;on to be a trafficking prie&s;t, &s;upplied with foreign coin, in order to excite new commotions in the kingdom, ordered him to be &s;ent to Falkland; but this Mr. Ruthven &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, and, with many arguments, urged the king to proceed to Perth, and examine into the matter him&s;elf. The king, who&s;e curio&s;ity was awakened by the &s;trangene&s;s of the affair, promi&s;ed to go when the chace was over, during the whole of which Ruthven continued his importunity in &s;o &s;trong at manner, that, even after it was over, he would not allow the king to wait a fre&s;h hor&s;e, but in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;etting out on the &s;ame he had hunted with the whole day. Mr. Ruth|ven, too, was very de&s;irous that the king &s;hould &s;et out without attendants; but this he refu&s;ed, and, with a train of about twenty per&s;ons, &s;et out for Perth.</P>
<P>The earl of Gowrie appri&s;ed by his brother of the king's approach, met him at a little di&s;tance from the town, and conducted him to his hou&s;e: mean time no preparations for entertaining his maje&s;ty appeared; the earl &s;eemed em|bara&s;&s;ed, nor did he apologize for the &s;eanty fare with which he entertained his royal gue&s;t. The king's repa&s;t be|ing over, his attendants were conducted by the earl to dine in another apartment. At that time Mr. Ruthven took the opportunity of whi&s;pering the king, that now he might have an opportunity of &s;eeing the unknown per&s;on. The king de&s;ired &s;ir Thomas Erskine to go with him; but Mr. Ruthven would not con&s;ent: he then conducted the king by a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, through &s;everal apartments, all of which he locked behind him, till at la&s;t he came to a &s;mall room, where, in&s;tead of a fettered criminal, as the king expected, he found a man &s;tanding compleately armed, with a &s;word and dagger at his &s;ide. Ruthven, upon his entrance, &s;natched the dagger from the man's &s;ide, and addre&s;&s;ing the king, &s;poke to him of his father's execution; that he was now his pri&s;oner, and at his mercy; but added, that if he would be quiet, and make no noi&s;e, his life &s;hould be in &s;afety. He then delivered back the man the dagger, told him to take care of the king, and at &s;ame time binding the king with an oath not to make any noi&s;e or di&s;turbance during his ab&s;ence, he returned to acquaint his brother with what he had done.</P>
<P>Mean while the king's attendants, impatient at his not appearing, inquired at Gowrie what had become of him: at that in&s;tant one of Gowrie's dome&s;tics entered the room, and acquainted them, that the king had ju&s;t mounted his hor&s;e, and rode off for Falkland; on which all of them immediately left the hou&s;e, and called for their hor&s;es. At this time Mr. Ruthven had returned to the king, and told him, that now he behoved to die, and at &s;ame time offer|ed to bind his hands. Unarmed as the king was, he would not &s;ubmit to &s;uch an indignity, but clo&s;ing with Mr. Ruthven, a fierce &s;truggle en&s;ued; during which the man in armour &s;tood by trembling, di&s;maid, and motionle&s;s, without offering the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his ma&s;ter, or violence to the king.</P>
<P>In the &s;cuffle the king had pulled Mr. Ruthven near a window, part of which was open, and, putting out his head, called out, with a wild affrighted voice, Trea&s;on! Murder! His attendants knew the voice, and ob&s;erving a hand at the window, collaring the king, they immediately ru&s;hed up &s;tairs to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The greater number took the principal &s;tair-ca&s;e, but found all the doors fa&s;t, which while they were attempting to force open, &s;ir John Ram&s;ay entered by a back &s;tair, and &s;eeing Mr. Ruthven &s;truggling with the king, drew his dagger, plunged it twice into his body, then pulled him from the king, and threw him down &s;tairs, where he was met by &s;ir Thomas Erskine, and &s;ir Hugh Herries, who, with their daggers, di&s;patched him; Mr. Ruthven calling out with his la&s;t breath, alas! alas! I am not to blame. During this &s;cuffle the man in armour, who had been concealed in the apartment, made his e&s;cape unknown.</P>
<P>There were now in the apartment with the king, Ram&s;ay, Erskine, and Herries, and one Wil&s;on a footman, who en|tered the room along with them. Before they had time to congratulate the king on his narrow e&s;cape, the earl came up the &s;ame back-&s;tair, and ru&s;hed in with a &s;word in each hand, attended by &s;even &s;ervants, compleatly armed, threat|ening them all with immediate death. Notwith&s;tanding the inequality of the numbers, the three gentlemen immedi|ately attacked the earl, and &s;ir John Ram&s;ay having run him through the heart, his followers immediately fled.</P>
<P>The king's attendants, who were endeavouring to force a pa&s;&s;age from the other &s;tair-ca&s;e, were now let in, and, with tran&s;ports of joy, congratulated the king on his deliverance; and he falling on his knees, with his attendants a|round him, offered thanks to God for his wonderful pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The danger however was not quite over: the inhabitants of Perth hearing of the death of the earl, their beloved provo&s;t and patron, &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and vowed vengeance again&s;t the king; but the magi&s;trates being admitted into the king's pre&s;ence, and acquainted with the fact, they, by their influence, by degrees appea&s;ed the multitudes, who &s;oon after di&s;per&s;ed. The king then returned to Falkland, having left the care of the dead bodies of the earl and his brother to the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tory handed down to us by many writers; but all of them are at a lo&s;s to account for the motives of a conduct &s;o contrary to the known character of the&s;e two brothers, who&s;e gentle and peaceable di&s;po&s;itions made them idolized by all who knew them.</P>
<P>Three of Gowrie's &s;ervants were afterwards hanged at Perth, for being concerned in the attempt; but from them no light could be drawn into this intricate affair; and the man who was concealed in the &s;tudy, and who, upon promi&s;e of pardon, had revealed him&s;elf, and proved to be the earl's &s;teward, was as much a &s;tranger to his ma&s;ter's de&s;ign as the re&s;t; and though placed in the &s;tudy, by the earl's immediate command, he did not even know for what end that &s;tation was a&s;&s;igned him; the truth of which &s;eems &s;trongly to appear from his behaviour to the king while alone in the apartment with him; and when, in&s;tead of appearing to have a de&s;ign upon his life or liberty, he &s;tood motion|le&s;s, trembling and affrighted; in &s;hort, altogether unfit for &s;o horrid an office.</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>GRAY Lord GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH Scotch and Engli&s;h antiquaries
agree, that the noble and antient &s;ir|name
of Gray is originally from France; and
that Fulbert, great chamberlain to Robert
duke of Normandy, got from that prince the
ca&s;tle and honour of Croy, <HI>alias</HI> Gray, in Pi|cardy,
from which he a&s;&s;umed his &s;irname.</P>
<P>This Fulbert had a &s;on,</P>
<P>John lord Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of England, vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE> who &s;ucceeded him,&mdash;and
a daughter,</P>
<P>Arlette, who was mother of William the
Conqueror.</P>
<P>Certain it is there were &s;everal of that &s;ir|name
came from France to Britain with that
great prince, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, and had con&s;iderable
commands in his army; and as he divided the
lands of England among&s;t his brave officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
we find that the Grays got a large &s;hare, made
a great figure, and became very numerous
&s;oon after William was ma&s;ter of the country.
They were progenitors of &s;everal noble families
that have flouri&s;hed with great lu&s;tre in that
kingdom ever &s;ince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salmon's a|bridgment, p. 124.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the dukes of Suffolk,
and Kent, the marquis of Dor&s;et, the earls of
Tankerville, and Stamford, the barons Gray
of Codnor, Ruthin, Wilton, Role&s;ton, Wark,
and Chillingham, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from which la&s;t is de|&s;cended
the lord Gray in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the northern counties there are &s;till ma|ny
antient families of that name, which en|joy
con&s;iderable e&s;tates, as appears from the
acts of parliament, nominating the ju&s;tices of
the peace, commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;upply, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>And it is ob&s;ervable, that the Grays in Scot|land
carry the &s;ame armorial bearings with
tho&s;e in the north of England, which may be
&s;een in their churches, tomb-&s;tones, and other
monuments of antiquity: and as Northum|berland
formerly belonged to Scotland, it is
the general opinion, that lord Gray of Chil|lingham
of that county, (who&s;e predece&s;&s;or
came over with William the Conqueror,) gave
the lands of Browfield or Broxmouth, in the
county of Roxburgh adjoining to it, to a
younger &s;on of his family, of whom all the
Grays in Scotland are &s;aid to be de&s;cended.</P>
<P>But both Scotch and Engli&s;h hi&s;torians,
who a&s;&s;ert, that the Grays came fir&s;t into
Scotland in the reign of king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, Boethius, Bu|chanan, &amp;c.</NOTE> are in
a mi&s;take; for we have undoubted proof,
that they were &s;ettled and making a figure in
this country near two hundred years before
that aera; or, above five hundred years ago.</P>
<P>And though we cannot &s;ix the preci&s;e time
of their coming, yet we &s;hall deduce the de|&s;cent
of this noble family, by authentic docu|ments,
in a direct line from</P>
<P>I. Sir HUGH de GRAY, a man of con&s;i|derable
rank and figure in the reign of king
Alexander II. (who &s;ucceeded to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1214;) was then proprietor of the lands
of Browfield or Broxmouth in Roxburgh|&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 173.</NOTE>
and is particularly documented by a
charter of Walter de Lundin to his kin&s;man
Philip de Feodary, ance&s;tor of the Meldrums
of that ilk, of the lands of Balcormack in
Fife, in which &s;ir Hugh de Gray, Alexander
earl of Buchan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes dominum de Lundin, and Book of ori|ginal writs, penes Mac|Farlane. vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE> William lord of Brechin, &s;ir
Philip de Melville, and &s;everal others were
witne&s;&s;es; and his being therein de&s;igned <HI>do|minus
Hugo de Gray,</HI> and in&s;erted before &s;ome
other honourable per&s;ons, is a &s;ufficient proof,

that was &s;ettled in Scotland. This char|ter
is without date; but, by the witne&s;&s;es,

<P>The following de&s;cent therefore is chiefly

a man of rank and figure, and flouri&s;hed in

agreed to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 4.</NOTE> believing it might put an end to
the wars and perpetual &s;ends that had &s;o long
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt the two nations; but the
earls of Huntly, Argyle, Montro&s;e, Bothwell,
Menteith, lord Fleming, and many other
worthy Scot&s;men oppo&s;ed it &s;trenuou&s;ly, be|ing
convinced that it would prove derogatory
to the dignity and independency of Scotland,
&s;o that it could never be got accompli&s;hed,
though king Henry VIII. had it very much at
heart.</P>
<P>There was then a treaty on foot with the
Engli&s;h, the articles whereof were agreed to
by a Scotch parliament; king Henry not only
refu&s;ed to ratify it, but cau&s;ed &s;eize &s;everal
Scotch &s;hips, laden with Scotch and French
commodities, upon the faith of the treaty,
which they thought was concluded. This no|torious
violation of the articles, the governor
re&s;ented highly; and in December 1543, cal|led
a parliament, who declared the treaty
void and null, and the governor immediately
rai&s;ed what forces he could to oppo&s;e the En|gli&s;h,
who had invaded our country with an
army of &s;even or eight thou&s;and men, under
the command of lord Evers. The Scots en|countered
them near Ancrum, in Teviotdale,
with an army not half their number, and to|tally
defeated them.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter the earl of Hertford
invaded Scotland with another army, and the
governor being now joined by 3500 French
auxiliaries, marched to oppo&s;e them; but up|on
the approach of the Scots, the Engli&s;h re|treated.</P>
<P>The governor, in his turn, invaded Eng|land,
defeated the Engli&s;h wherever he met
them, and returned crowned with laurels, and
his &s;oldiers laden with great booty. He had
then the en&s;igns of the mo&s;t noble order of
St. Michael &s;ent him from France by king
Francis I. <HI>anno</HI> 1546.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. dying in January there|after,
the duke of Somer&s;et, protector of Eng|land,
and tutor to king Edward VI. invaded
Scotland with a powerful army, &s;upported by
a &s;trong fleet. The governor of Scotland en|countered
them at Pinky-cleugh, where the
Scots behaved with the utmo&s;t courage and
re&s;olution, but being overpowered by num|bers,
were at la&s;t totally defeated, and about
8000 of them killed in the field, on 10th
September 1547.</P>
<P>The governor, not at all di&s;mayed with
this lo&s;s, appointed a meeting of the nobility
at Stirling, and, in a mo&s;t pathetic &s;peech, he
fir&s;t condoled with them for their lo&s;s at Pin|ky,
then he put them in mind of the great
&s;pirit and magnanimity with which their an|ce&s;tors
had defended them&s;elves, and main|tained
their independency again&s;t their im|placable
enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This had &s;uch an ef|fect
upon them, that they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved
rather to hazard all than &s;ubmit to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>They then applied to their old allies the
French; and, at the &s;ame time, propo&s;ed a
match betwixt their young queen and the
dolphin, &s;on of king Francis I. who was then
plea&s;ed to create the governor duke of Chat|telherault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extract from the regi&s;ter of the parliament of Paris.</NOTE>
with a revenue of 30,000 livres <HI>per
annum,</HI> to enable him to &s;upport that dignity,
to him and his heirs for ever.</P>
<P>The duke of Chattelherault, the governor,
after &s;everal conventions with the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners in 1551 and 1552,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom XV. p. 263, 319, 326, &amp;c.</NOTE> at la&s;t con|cluded
a treaty with them, and &s;ettled the
marches on the borders, in December 1552.</P>
<P>The duke Cattelherault continued gover|nor
of Scotland till the year 1555, and then
re&s;igned, in full parliament, to the queen's mo|ther,
when his whole conduct was approven
of; and he was again declared next heir to the
crown, failing heirs of the queen's body, after
he had delivered up the <HI>regalia</HI> and en&s;igns of
government.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="345">
When queen Mary returned from France,
<HI>anno</HI> 1561, the duke of Chattelherault, who was
a great friend to the reformation, was appoint|ed
one of the privy council; and, in 1566,
was &s;ent to France to take care of her maje|&s;ty's
intere&s;t there, where he continued till
the queen was forced to make a re&s;ignation of
the government in favours of her &s;on: up|on
which he was called home to be head of
the loyali&s;ts. He u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to get
the earl of Murray degraded, and did every
thing in his power for her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice;
but at la&s;t, when he found that all attempts
to get the queen re&s;tored to the government
were in vain, he entered into an agreement
with the regent, for him&s;elf, the earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis,
lord Herris, and others of the queen's friends,
the articles whereof are at large in Crawford's
peerage of Scotland, page 197, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon the
faith of which, the duke came to Edinburgh,
tru&s;ting to the regent's engagements, but was
no &s;ooner in his power, than he was confined
in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, where he was kept
pri&s;oner till the regent was put to death by
James Hamilton of Bothwelhaugh, on 23d
January 1570.</P>
<P>The earl of Lennox being then made re|gent,
the duke, with his two &s;ons, and many
more of his name and family, were outlawed
and forfeited: however, the duke continued
firm and &s;teady in the queen's intere&s;t to the
very la&s;t; and, for his untainted loyalty, &s;har|ed
greatly in her maje&s;ty's misfortunes; but
being now old and infirm, he retired to France,
where he remained till the heat of the civil
war was over, and died &s;oon after his return
home, <HI>anno</HI> 1575.</P>
<P>By lady Margaret Douglas, his wife, elde&s;t
daughter of James earl of Morton, he left i&s;|&s;ue
&s;our &s;ons and &s;our daughters.</P>

<P>XI. JAMES, third earl of Arran, and ele|venth
duke of Chattelherault, was a youth of
great hopes and expectations, and &s;eemed to
inherit all the virtues of his worthy ance&s;tors.
He went to France <HI>anno</HI> 1555, was much ta|ken
notice of by king Henry II. who made
him captain of his Scotch life-guards; but
&s;ome time thereafter he came to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE>
turned melancholy, retired from the world,
died without i&s;&s;ue, <HI>anno</HI> 1609, and was &s;uc|ceeded
by his nephew James, &s;on of his bro|ther
lord John, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XI. Lord JOHN, afterwards marquis of
Hamilton, &s;econd &s;on of James &s;econd earl of
Arran,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. arch. and &s;e|veral charters penes ducem de Hamilton.</NOTE> and duke of Chattelherault, born <HI>anno</HI>
1532, was appointed commendator of Ar|broath,
by king James V. <HI>anno</HI> 1541, by
which title he was de&s;igned for many years
thereafter.</P>
<P>He was mo&s;t zealous in &s;upport of the queen's
cau&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed the
government in the name of king James her
&s;on; was deeply engaged in the civil wars that
en&s;ued thereupon, and never de&s;erted the in|tere&s;t
of queen Mary, in her deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he was carried pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle
of Lochleven, the commendator entered into
that memorable a&s;&s;ociation, with &s;everal o|thers
of the nobility, obliging them&s;elves to
&s;tand by one another in defence of the queen,
and to endeavour to procure her liberty at
the hazard of their lives and fortunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
for which, and his other acts of loyalty, he,
with his brother lord Claud, was, by the rul|ing
faction at the time, outlawed and &s;orfeit|ed,
as before hinted, <HI>anno</HI> 1570.</P>
<P>He then made his e&s;cape to France, where
he continued in bani&s;hment for &s;everal years;
and the queen was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his un&s;haken
fidelity, that when that cruel &s;entence of death
was pa&s;&s;ed upon her in England, &s;he pulled a
ring off her finger, and ordered one of her &s;er|vants
to deliver it to her cou&s;in lord John Ha|milton,
as a token of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e &s;he had
of his con&s;tant fidelity and &s;ufferings for her
intere&s;t; which ring is &s;till pre&s;erved in the
family.</P>
<P>When he heard that the king had begun
to take the management of affairs upon him|&s;elf,
he returned to Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1585; and
being joined by his brother lord Claud, with
&s;everal others of the nobility, they advanced,
with what forces they could rai&s;e, to Stirling,
where the king then was, and repre&s;ented to
him, that as their enemies had contrived their
ruin, and had deprived them of all other
means of imploring his protection, they were
reduced to the hard nece&s;lity of coming in
that manner. They were then admitted into
<PB N="333" REF="346">
the king's pre&s;ence, and received their par|dons;
and the king addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to lord
John, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My lord, I never did &s;ee you
before, and mu&s;t confe&s;s that you have
been wronged. You was a faithful &s;ervant
to my mother, and hardly u&s;ed when I un|der&s;tood
not the &s;tate of things as I now
do."</Q> Lord John was &s;oon thereafter made
governor of Dunbarton ca&s;tle, and admitted
of the privy council.</P>
<P>When the king went to Norway to bring
home his queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 27 &amp; 28, ad annum 1588.</NOTE> he deputed lord John to pre|&s;erve
the peace of the borders, and appointed
him one of the regency, till his return.</P>
<P>The king's favour for him &s;till increa&s;ing,
he was plea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacKenzie's heraldry.</NOTE> in regard of his great &s;uffer|ings,
and long and faithful &s;ervices, to dignify
him with the title of marquis of Hamilton, <HI>an|no</HI>
1599.</P>
<P>The king afterwards vi&s;ited him o&s;ten at
his palace of Hamilton, and he continued to
enjoy a large &s;hare of his maje&s;ty's e&s;teem
and favour as long as he lived.</P>
<P>He married Margaret Lyon, daughter of
John lord Glammis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Ha|milton.</NOTE> ance&s;tor of the earl of
Strathmore, widow of Gilbert earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis,
by whom he had one &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI>&mdash;and one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John lord
Maxwell, ance&s;tor of the earl of Nith&s;dale.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1604, and was &s;ucceded by
his only &s;on,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, &s;econd marquis of Hamilton,
born <HI>anno</HI> 1589, who &s;ucceeded al&s;o to his
uncle James, earl of Arran, and duke of Chat|telherault,
<HI>anno</HI> 1609, as before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the gentlemen of
the king's bed-chamber, and one of the lords
of his privy council, before he arrived at the
age of twenty-one.</P>
<P>The king al&s;o, in con&s;ideration of his fa|ther's
fidelity and &s;ufferings for queen Mary,
erected into a temporal lord&s;hip the abbay|lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
with the patronages and tythes of the
mona&s;tery of Arbroath, in favours of the mar|quis,
by his royal charter dated <HI>anno</HI> 1608,
which was a great acce&s;&s;ion to his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>He was afterwards made &s;teward of the
king's hou&s;hold, and, as another great in&s;tance
of his maje&s;ty's favour, he was created a peer
of England, by the titles of lord Innerdale,
and earl of Cambridge, <HI>anno</HI> 1619, the ho|nours
being limited to the heirs-male of his
body.</P>
<P>He was appointed lord high commi&s;&s;ioner
to the parliament 1621, when the five ar|ticles
of the a&s;&s;embly of Perth were ratified;
and having managed matters in the&s;e tickli&s;h
times with great prudence and dexterity, he
di&s;&s;olved the parliament 27th Augu&s;t there|after,
and was in&s;talled at Wind&s;or one of the
knights of the mo&s;t noble order of the gar|ter,
7th July 1623.</P>
<P>He married lady Anne Cunninghame daugh|ter
of James earl of Glencairn, by whom he
had three &s;ons, and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> al&s;o duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P>3. Lord <HI>John,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to Hugh
earl of Eglington, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John earl
of Crawfurd, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married to James earl of
Queensberry, without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1625, and was &s;ucceeded by
his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, third marquis of Hamilton,
and &s;econd earl of Cambridge, born in 1606.
He was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet's me|moirs of the family of Ha|milton.</NOTE> by king Charles I. appointed a mem|ber
of his privy council in both kingdoms;
and was al&s;o made one of the gentlemen of
his bed-chamber, and ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, <HI>anno</HI>
1628.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1630, he had the honour to repre|&s;ent
the king of Bohemia, and &s;tood god-fa|ther
to king Charles II.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year, by the king's direction,
he entered into treaty with Gu&s;tavus Adol|phus,
of Sweden, to rai&s;e 6000 men for the
&s;ervice of that prince, to be employed again&s;t
the Imperiali&s;ts, for the recovery of the Pa|latinate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
with which force he &s;ailed from
Yarmouth the following year, having ju&s;t be|fore
his departure been elected and in&s;talled
knight of the mo&s;t noble order of the gar|ter.</P>
<P>In 1638, he was &s;ent by the king into
Scotland, to endeavour to appea&s;e the com|motions
beginning there, and was made his
maje&s;ty's high commi&s;&s;ioner to the general a&s;|&s;embly
of the kirk; but they were then be|come
&s;o very untractable, that, according to
his in&s;tructions, he was obliged to di&s;&s;olve
them. The next year he had the command
of the fleet that was &s;ent to try to bring the
covenanters to rea&s;on, the king having ad|vanced
as far as Berwick, with about &s;ix
thou&s;and land forces; and by the marquis's
mediation, a treaty was &s;et on foot, and a pa|cification
en&s;ued.</P>
<P>But as the behaviour and conduct of this
great man, during the whole cour&s;e of the
civil war, is recorded by many able hi&s;tori|ans,
we &s;hall &s;ay little more of it here; but
for his good and faithful &s;ervices to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
he was created duke of Hamilton, marquis of
Clyd&s;dale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by patent, in which all the
<PB N="334" REF="347">
titles of the family are narrated, <Q REND="inline">"to him and
the heirs-male of his body; which failing,

April, <HI>anno</HI> 1643.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here add al&s;o the &s;peech he made
to the Scotch parliament, again&s;t delivering
up the king to the Engli&s;h, which was in
the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will Scotland now quit her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
and intere&s;t in her &s;overeign, and do it to
tho&s;e who&s;e emnity to him and us doth vi|&s;ibly
appear?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and Scots com|pend. p. 61.</NOTE> Is this the con&s;equence of all
your prote&s;tations of duty and affection to
his maje&s;ty? Is this the keeping of your
covenant, wherein you have &s;worn to de|fend
the king's maje&s;ty, per&s;on, and au|thority?
Is this a &s;uitable return for the
king's goodne&s;s, both in con&s;enting to all
your de&s;ires in 1641, and in his late tru&s;t|ing
his per&s;on with you What cen&s;ures
will the world pa&s;s upon this action? What
a &s;tain will it be to the whole reformed re|ligion?
and what danger may we not ap|prehend,
both to the king's per&s;on, and to
Scotland, from the party that now prevails
in England?"</Q></P>
<P>However, all he could do or &s;ay did not
prevail; the king was delivered up to the
Engli&s;h, the fatal con&s;equence of which we
need not repeat.</P>
<P>The duke, who did every thing in his
power to wipe off that everla&s;ting &s;tain upon
the Scotch nation, at the parliament 1648,
prevailed &s;o far, that it was agreed to rai&s;e an
army in defence, and for the relief of the
king, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which the duke of Hamilton
got the command. He marched directly in|to
England, was attacked by the parliament's
forces, near Pre&s;ton, where his army was to|tally
de&s;eated, and him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>After &s;everal months confinement, he was
brought to a trial before that infamous high
court of ju&s;tice, where he received &s;entence
of death, and was accordingly beheaded in
Palace-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter, on 9th March
1649, a few weeks after one of the be&s;t of
kings had &s;uffered the &s;ame &s;ate.</P>
<P>He died with undaunted courage, and re|markable
tranquillity and compo&s;ure of mind,
declared his &s;teady and firm attachment to the
prote&s;tant religion, and prayed for the re|&s;toration
of the royal family, the moment be|&s;ore
he laid his head upon the block.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Fielding, daughter
of William earl of Denbigh, by Su&s;anna his
wife, &s;i&s;ter to George Villiers, the great duke
of Buckinghame, and by her had three &s;ons,
and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. Charles.</P>
<P>2. James.</P>
<P>3. William.</P>
<P>All the above &s;ons died young.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter, lady <HI>Mary,</HI> died young.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who became dutche&s;s of

<P>3. Lady <HI>Su&s;anna,</HI> married to John earl of

<P>The duke was &s;uccceded in his e&s;tate and
honours by his brother,</P>
<P>XIII. WILLIAM, &s;econd duke of Hamilton,
and third earl of Cambridge, born 14th De|cember
1616, who was a man of great ac|compli&s;hments,
honour, and integrity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv. Careli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> and was
&s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed by king Charles I. by whom

and Polmont, by letters patent dat|ed
31&s;t March 1639.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the earl of Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. penes ducem de Hamilton.</NOTE> he
was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland,
<HI>anno</HI> 1640, and was made knight of the mo&s;t
noble order of the garter.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not trouble our readers with an
account of his noble conduct during the civil
war, it being fully &s;et forth in the hi&s;tories
of the&s;e times; we &s;hall only add, that after
the murder of the king, he rai&s;ed a troop of
hor&s;e at his own charge for the &s;ervice of
king Charles II. in order to his re&s;toration,
with which he marched to the fatal battle of
Worce&s;ter, fought valiantly upon their head,
on 3d September 1651, and received a wound
in his leg, of which he died in eight days
thereafter, and was buried in the cathedral
of Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this great man's charac|ter,
with the earl of Clarendon's words, who
will not be &s;u&s;pected of partiality in his fa|vours.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was a man not inferior in partsor un|der&s;tanding

daughter of James fir&s;t duke of Hamilton,
the undoubted heir of line of the family, and
now dutche&s;s of Hamilton, married William
Douglas earl of Selkirk, elde&s;t &s;on of Willi|am
marquis of Douglas, by his &s;econd wife
lady Mary Gordon, daughter of George mar|quis
of Huntly; in con&s;equence of which
marriage, upon a petition from the dutche&s;s,
he was created duke of Hamilton for life,
with all the titles, dignities, and precedency
belonging to the family, which appears by the
diploma,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in archivis Ca|roli II.</NOTE> <HI>Willielmi ducis de Hamilton, mar|chionis
Clyd&s;dale, comitis Arraniae, Lanarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ae et
Selkirk, domini Acon, Machan&s;hire, et Daer,
&amp;c.</HI> dated 12th October 1660.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon thereafter made one of the
privy council, and knight of the mo&s;t noble
order of the garter.</P>
<P>Upon king James VII.'s acce&s;&s;ion to the
crown, he was made a lord of the trea&s;ury,
an extraordinary lord of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and a privy
councillor for both kingdoms, in which office
he continued all king James's reign.</P>
<P>When the prince of Orange came over to
England, he was cho&s;en, by divers Scotch no|bility
and gentry then in London, to be their
pre&s;ident, when they addre&s;&s;ed that prince to
take upon him the admini&s;tration of all affairs,
civil and military, and was al&s;o cho&s;en pre&s;i|dent
of the convention of e&s;tates, who de|clared
the crown vacant, and &s;ettled it on that
prince.</P>
<P>After he was crowned king, the duke was
appointed pre&s;ident of the council, one of the
extraordinary lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and lord high
admiral of Scotland.</P>
<P>By &s;aid lady Anne dutche&s;s of Hamilton he
left i&s;&s;ue &s;even &s;ons, and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Arran.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>William,</HI> who died in France
without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of Selkirk.</P>
<P>4. <HI>John,</HI> earl of Ruglen.</P>
<P>5. <HI>George,</HI> earl of Orkney.</P>
<P>6. Lord <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> who married Mary, daugh|ter
and &s;ole heire&s;s of &s;ir David Dunhar of
Baldoon, Bart. and was grandfather of Dun|bar,
now earl of Selkirk.</P>
<P>7. Lord <HI>Archibald,</HI> who was appointed go|vernor
of Jamaica by queen Anne, was a flag-officer
in the navy, and governor of Green|wich
ho&s;pital. He married lady Jane Ha|milton,
daughter of James earl of Abercorn,
and had i&s;&s;ue two &s;ons.</P>
<P>The duke's 1&s;t daughter, lady <HI>Catharine,</HI>
married to John duke of Athole.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Su&s;anna,</HI> married, 1&s;t, to John
earl of Dundonald; and, 2dly, to Charles
marquis of Tweeddale.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to James earl
of Panmure.</P>
<P>And dying <HI>anno</HI> 1694, was &s;ucceeded by
his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XV. JAMES, fourth duke of Hamilton, in
his father's lifetime de&s;igned earl of Arran,
was born 11th April 1658, had a noble and
liberal education &s;uitable to his high birth and
quality.</P>
<P>Upon his return from his travels, he was
particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by king Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of Eng|land, vol. III.</NOTE>
and was made one of the gentlemen of his bed|chamber,
<HI>anno</HI> 1679, and was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador
extraordinary to the court of France, 1683.</P>
<P>When king James VII. &s;ucceeded to the
crown, he was made ma&s;ter of the wardrobe,
knight of the thi&s;tle, and colonel of the royal
regiment of hor&s;e.</P>
<P>He was &s;teady in the intere&s;t of that un|fortunate
prince, and never left him till he
embarked for France, 23d December 1688,
and was always &s;u&s;pected of retaining a warm
affection to him, even when the revolution
had altered the &s;y&s;tem of government, and
directed the &s;ubjects allegiance to a new king;
which plainly appears from the &s;peech he made
in the beginning of 1689, when the prince
of Orange asked the opinion of the Scotch
<PB N="336" REF="349">
nobility and gentry then at London, in rela|tion
to the affairs in Scotland. Upon this oc|ca&s;ion
the earl of Arran delivered his opinion
as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have all the honour and deference for
the prince of Orange imaginable. I think
him a brave prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellaneous collections of the year 1689. Crawfurd's peerage, p. 215.</NOTE> and that we owe him
great obligations, in contributing &s;o much
to our delivery from popery: but while I
pay tho&s;e prai&s;es, I cannot violate my duty
to my ma&s;ter. I mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between
his popery and his per&s;on; I di&s;like the
one, but have &s;worn and do owe allegiance
to the other, which makes it impo&s;&s;ible
for me to a&s;&s;ign away that which I cannot
forbear believing is the king my ma&s;ter's
right; for his pre&s;ent ab&s;ence from us in
France can no more affect my duty, than
his longer ab&s;ence from us has done before;
and the prince de&s;iring our advice, mine is,
that we &s;hould move his maje&s;ty to re|turn,
and call a free parliament, for the &s;e|curing
our religion and property, which,
in my humble opinion, will at la&s;t be found
the be&s;t way to heal all our breaches."</Q></P>
<P>After king William was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
throne, the earl of Arran was twice &s;ent pri|&s;oner
to the tower, on &s;u&s;picion of corre&s;pond|ing
with king James; but was never pro&s;e|cuted;
however, he lived a retired life the
greate&s;t part of king William's reign.</P>
<P>His father, being created duke only for
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem deHa|milton, et Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> as before noticed, the hereditary honours
of the family &s;till remained in the dutche&s;s,
and did not de&s;cend to the earl of Arran their
&s;on upon his father's death; wherefore the
dutche&s;s made a &s;urrender of her titles into the
king's hands, upon which a patent pa&s;t, creat|ing
him duke of Hamilton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the pre|cedency
of his grand-father's patent in 1643,
as if he had &s;ucceeded thereto by his father's
death. This patent is dated at Loo, 10th
Augu&s;t 1698.</P>
<P>He oppo&s;ed the union of the two crowns,
and, at the inva&s;ion 1708, was, by order of
council, taken into the cu&s;tody of a me&s;&s;enger,
upon &s;u&s;picion of his being privy to that ex|pedition;
but he was &s;oon admitted to bail,
the duke of Newca&s;tle, earl of Wharton, and
lord Halifax being his &s;ureties; and that &s;ame
year he was elected one of the &s;ixteen peers
for Scotland to the Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>In 1710, he was created a peer of Great-Britain,
by the titles of duke of Brandon, and
baron Dutton in England, by patent; the pre|amble
whereof, (which is very honourable
for the family,) is to be found in the Scots
compendium, page 65; but in December the
&s;ame year his Engli&s;h peerage was di&s;puted in
the Briti&s;h parliament, and was found to be
incon&s;i&s;tent with the articles of union, and
was therefore at that time &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>In 1712, he was con&s;tituted ma&s;ter of the
ordnance, and knight of the mo&s;t noble order
of the garter as well as the thi&s;tle, the queen
having declared &s;he would wear both orders
her&s;elf; and immediately thereafter, upon the
conclu&s;ion of the treaty of Utrecht, he was
appointed her maje&s;ty's amba&s;&s;ador extraordi|nary
to the court of France; but a little be|fore
he was to have &s;et out for that kingdom,
he fought a duel with lord Mohun, wherein
they were both killed, on 15th November
1712.</P>
<P>Had not the duke been a man of uncom|mon
bravery, he might well have refu&s;ed the
challenge, being a privy councillor, and her
maje&s;ty's amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary; but that
he thought was incon&s;i&s;tent with his honour:
and &s;ome &s;u&s;pected he was killed unfairly by
general MacCartney, lord Mohun's &s;econd,
who, after king George's acce&s;&s;ion to the
crown, &s;tood his trial, and was acquitted.</P>
<P>His grace's mother, Anne, the dutche&s;s
dowager, &s;urvived him four years, and died
<HI>anno</HI> 1716, aged eighty.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, lady Anne Spencer, daugh|ter
of Robert earl of Sunderland, by whom
he had two daughters, that died young.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Elizabeth, daughter and
&s;ole heire&s;s of Digby, lord Gerard of Bromly,
by Elizabeth his wife, daughter to Charles
earl of Macclesfield, by whom he had i&s;&s;ue
three &s;ons, and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> marquis of Clyd&s;dale, after|wards
duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>William,</HI> who married Anne,
daughter and heire&s;s of Francis Hawes, E&s;q;
but died without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>3. Lord <HI>Anne,</HI> &s;o named, in regard that
the queen was his god-mother. He married
Mi&s;s Pownel, an heire&s;s, by whom he had i&s;|&s;ue.</P>

<P>It is acknowledged by all our hi&s;torians,
that this Somerled was a man of great power

whereupon he and his po&s;terity, for &s;e|veral

<P>Somerled being no le&s;s ambitious than great,
rai&s;ed an army, and invaded the territories of
Malcom IV. who &s;ucceeded David, was join|ed

<P>2. <HI>Reginald,</HI> who got from his father a
con&s;iderable e&s;tate, confirmed to him by a
charter under the great &s;eal in the&s;e words:

1373.</P>
<P>This Reginald was progenitor of the Mac|Donalds
of Moydart, Clanronald, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of whom
Glengary, Moror, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are de&s;cended; but
whether he was a &s;on of a former marriage,
or older or younger than John's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, we
&s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>But as the different branches of the clan
MacDonald do not agree about this part of
their hi&s;tory, we &s;hall only make an obvious
remark or two upon the preceeding charters,
and leave the determination of the points in
di&s;pute to the judgment of our readers.</P>
<P>John of the I&s;les got his fir&s;t charter, under
the great &s;eal, of all the lands therein menti|oned,
<Q REND="inline">"to him&s;elf and his heirs-general, hold|ing
of the king,"</Q> before narrated, 1372.</P>
<P>About ten months thereafter, he gave a
con&s;iderable e&s;tate to his &s;on Reginald, and
the heirs-male of his body, confirmed and ap|proved
by the king, not holding of the crown,
but of John him&s;elf, and his heirs, whereby
John's lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or became Reginald's &s;u|perior;
and in the charter Reginald is neither
de&s;igned <HI>filius legitimus,</HI> nor <HI>dilectus filius,</HI> (the
common &s;tile in old charters,) but &s;imply <HI>fili|us
meus:</HI> therefore, by any thing that appears
upon record, John's lawful heir was a diffe|rent
per&s;on from Reginald.</P>
<P>John died in the end of 1387, or beginning
of 1388, and was in&s;allibly &s;ucceeded in all
the e&s;tates he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and in the &s;u|periority
of the other lands he had given off
to his children, by his &s;on,</P>
<P>VIII. DONALD lord of the i&s;les, who, it
&s;eems, &s;et out upon an independent &s;ooting; for
Richard king of England entered into a trea|ty
with him as a &s;overeign prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VII.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1388,
and his father John is then &s;aid to be <HI>nuper
defunitus.</HI></P>
<P>This Donald was a man of an a&s;piring ge|nius,
and had va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> he gave off
parts of his lands to his friends and neighbours,
<HI>viz.</HI> the MacLeans, MacInto&s;hes, MacKenzies,
MacKinnons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all holding of him&s;elf for
military &s;ervice, which greatly encrea&s;ed his
power; but, upon the forfeiture of this fami|ly,
the&s;e clans got their lands holding of the
crown.</P>
<P>In the year 1400, Donald, lord of the i&s;les,
and John de I&s;le his brother, got a &s;afe con|duct
from king Henry IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. VIII. p. 146.</NOTE> to come to Eng|land
with one hundred hor&s;e in their retinue,
to treat of a peace with the Engli&s;h, for them|&s;elves
and their friends.</P>
<P>The king of England afterwards gave pow|er
to his commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of a final peace
with them in their own country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1405.</P>
<P>In a truce concluded betwixt the king of
England and France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. IX.</NOTE> Donald, lord of the I&s;les
and John Stanely of Man, are included as in|dependent
princes, <HI>anno</HI> 1414.</P>
<P>They are again both included in a treaty
with France as allies of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. XII. p. 400.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1416;
whereby it appears, that this lord was more
in the Engli&s;h intere&s;t than the Scotch.</P>
<P>He married dame Margaret Le&s;ly, only
daughter of Walter Le&s;ly, by lady Eupheme,
elde&s;t daughter and co-heire&s;s of William, the
la&s;t male of the antient earls of Ro&s;s, and up|on
who&s;e heirs the e&s;tate and honours of
Ro&s;s were &s;ettled by act of parliament. By
her he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>As the battle of Harlaw happened in con|&s;equence
of this marriage, we &s;hall briefly ac|count
for it as follows:</P>
<P>Walter Le&s;ly, who married Eupheme,
counte&s;s of Ro&s;s, (be&s;ides his daughter, mar|ried
to the lord of the i&s;les,) had a &s;on Alex|ander,
who became earl of Ro&s;s, as heir to his
mother: He married I&s;abel, daughter of Ro|bert
duke of Albany, governor of Scotland,
by whom he had an only daughter, Eupheme,
counte&s;s of Ro&s;s, his &s;ole heire&s;s: &s;he became
a nun, and died without i&s;&s;ue, whereby the
&s;ucce&s;&s;i on to the earldom of Ro&s;s, in right
of blood, ought to have devolved upon the
&s;aid dame Margaret Le&s;ly, lady of the I&s;les,
her undoubted heir of line.</P>
<P>But the duke of Albany having obtained
from his grand-child, Eupheme the nun, a re|&s;ignation
of her honours in favours of his &s;e|cond
&s;on the earl of Buchan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;ign. penes comitem de Rothes.</NOTE> and failing heirs|male
of his body, to fall to the crown, the
earl of Buchan thereupon added that of Ro&s;s
to his other titles.</P>
<P>Donald lord of the I&s;les claimed that earl|dom
in right of his wife; the duke of Albany
determined his &s;on &s;hould have it, in virtue of
the nun's re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Donald being denied what he thought he
had a ju&s;t title to, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert his right
by force of arms, and rai&s;ed an army of about
<PB N="361" REF="376">
ten thou&s;and men, chiefly of his own friends
and followers, the clans before-mentioned.</P>
<P>The duke was not behind-hand with him
in rai&s;ing forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 414.</NOTE> but &s;oon got together an ar|my
much about the &s;ame number, command|ed
by the brave Alexander Stewart, earl of
Mar.</P>
<P>They met near a village called Harlaw,
within ten miles of Aberdeen, where a mo&s;t
bloody battle en&s;ued, fought with incredible
ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in which many brave
men lo&s;t their lives; but neither had rea&s;on
to brag much of the victory. The lord of
the i&s;les, rather wearied than conquered, re|treated
the next day, and the earl of Mar was
not in a condition to pur&s;ue him. This hap|pened
<HI>anno</HI> 1411.</P>
<P>It &s;eems Donald afterwards made up mat|ters
with the governor; for the earl of Buchan
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the earldom of Ro&s;s without further
di&s;turbance, till he was &s;lain at the battle of
Vernoil in France, <HI>anno</HI> 1424; then that earl|dom
came to the crown, in virtue of the re|&s;ignation
by Eupheme the nun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> before-menti|oned.
This is fully in&s;tructed by many char|ters
under the great &s;eal, to be &s;een in our
public records, though it does not appear
that the &s;aid dame Margaret, lady of the I&s;les,
ever gave up her title;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II.</NOTE> for &s;he always de|&s;igned
her&s;elf counte&s;s of Ro&s;s, even after the
crown was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that earldom.</P>
<P>Donald died in France, <HI>anno</HI> 1427, and was
&s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>IX. ALEXANDER afterwards earl of Ro&s;s,
of whom Buchanan &s;ays, he was <HI>unus po&s;t regem
longe potenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;imus, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In his mother's lifetime he de&s;igned him|&s;elf
<HI>dominus in&s;ularum et magi&s;ter comitatus
Ro&s;&s;iae;</HI> for it &s;eems he &s;till intended to a&s;&s;ert
his title to that earldom. He rai&s;ed an army
of above ten thou&s;and men, burnt the town
of Inverne&s;s, and laid wa&s;te a great part of
the country. The king, being highly incen|&s;ed
at this in&s;olence, rai&s;ed an army to oppo&s;e
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 489.</NOTE> and came up with him in Lochaber.
The clan Chatton, and the Camerons, &s;eeing
the &s;tandard of their lawful &s;overeign, de&s;ert|ed
the lord of the I&s;les, who&s;e forces, being
immediately attacked by the king's troops,
were &s;oon routed and put to &s;light, in the
year 1429.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter, Alexander, repenting
of his di&s;loyal practices, threw him&s;elf at the
king's feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 490.</NOTE> and implored mercy; who, not|with&s;tanding
his open rebellion, was graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to pardon him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t king James, out of his great good|ne&s;s
and love of ju&s;tice, yielded the earldom
of Ro&s;s to him, being &s;en&s;ible he had a good
title to it in right of his mother, who was re|ally
heir of line of the family, as before ob|&s;erved,
by which acce&s;&s;ion to his e&s;tate he be|came
one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful
&s;ubjects in the kingdom.</P>
<P>This Alexander, earl of Ro&s;s, grants a char|ter
to John Ro&s;s of Kilravock in liferent, and
his &s;on Hugh his apparent heir in fee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> of the
lands of Kilravock, Ea&s;ter-Geddes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon
Kilravock's re&s;ignation to the earl, as his law|ful
&s;uperior, 22d June 1440, confirmed by a
charter under the great &s;eal.</P>
<P>In the minority of king James II. he was,
by the e&s;tates of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> appointed ju|&s;ticiar
of Scotland, benorth the river Forth;
and it is acknowledged he kept all that coun|try
in peace and good order as long as he liv|ed.</P>
<P>He granted &s;everal charters and other deeds
as earl of Ro&s;s, and lord of the I&s;les,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> all con|firmed
by charters under the great &s;eal, which
is a &s;ufficient proof, that the crown acquie&s;eed
in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that earldom.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Gordon.</NOTE> daughter of &s;ir A|lexander
Seton, lord of Gordon, and &s;i&s;ter of
Alexander, fir&s;t earl of Huntly, by whom he
had three &s;ons, and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugh,</HI> progenitor of the MacDonalds
of Slate, as will be &s;hown hereafter.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Cele&s;tine,</HI> ance&s;tor of lord MacDonald.
<HI>Vide</HI> title lord MacDonald.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the family of Su|therland.</NOTE> <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John
earl of Sutherland, and was mother of Eliza|beth,
heire&s;s of that noble family.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Florence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> married to Duncan MacInto&s;h,
captain of the clan Chatton.</P>
<P>This earl died in the end of 1448, or be|ginning
of 1449, and was &s;ucceeded by his
elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>X. JOHN, earl of Ro&s;s, and lord of the
I&s;les, who was certainly one of the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t powerful men in the kingdom, and
behaved like a dutiful and loyal &s;ubject, ex|cepting
his engagement with the earl of Dou|glas,
as long as king James II. lived, with
whom he appeared to be in great favour.</P>
<P>There was a truce concluded with the En|gli&s;h
in November 1449,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 254, &amp;c.</NOTE> in which John earl
of Ro&s;s was one of the guarantees; and to an|other
in 1451.</P>
<P>And though he was engaged in the earl of
Douglas's rebellion, yet it is certain he made
his peace with the king very &s;oon thereafter;
for in the year 1457, he is one of the gua|rantees
of a treaty with the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 397, and 434.</NOTE> and one
of the wardens of the marches; and again in
1459.</P>
<P>But after the death of king James II. he be|gun
<PB N="362" REF="377">
to revive the old preten&s;ions of his fa|mily
to independency; and, &s;haking off his al|legiance
to his lawful &s;overeign, he entered
into a treaty with the king of England in the
following terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>"That John de Yle, earl of Ro&s;s, and lord
of the I&s;les, Donald Balagh, and John of

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> become liegemen and &s;ubjects to king

and that they &s;hall remain for ever &s;ubjects

all their enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> King Edward,
on the other part, agrees, and gives the earl

the two kingdoms, that England &s;hall

earl of Ro&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 486.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> comprehended in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P></Q>
<P>This treaty was concluded 8th February
1462, but was kept &s;ecret for &s;everal years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and was never di&s;covered till there was actu|ally
a final peace concluded between Scotland
and England; by an article whereof it was
provided, that both the re&s;pective kings &s;hould
renounce all former engagements made again&s;t
each other; the Engli&s;h were thereby oblig|ed
to produce their treaty with the earl of
Ro&s;s, by which this trea&s;onable intrigue came
to light, <HI>anno</HI> 1474.</P>
<P>In the interim the earl of Ro&s;s got char|ters
under the great &s;eal from king James III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
of many lands and baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1468 <HI>et</HI>
1474.</P>
<P>At la&s;t John earl of Ro&s;s was &s;ummoned

<P>The lord Boyd was twice &s;ent one of the
amba&s;&s;adors extraordinary to the court of Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 517, and 541.</NOTE>
in the years 1464 and 1465, and con|ducted
his negociations with great dexterity,
honour and fidelity.</P>
<P>After the death of archbi&s;hop Kennedy,
the chief management of all public affairs de|volved
upon the lord Boyd, who was a man
of fine addre&s;s, and great authority and power.
His brother &s;ir Alexander was employed to teach
the king the manly and military exerci&s;es, and
con&s;equently much about his per&s;on: in &s;hort,
there was &s;carce any body could have acce&s;s
to his Maje&s;ty, without the Boyds permi&s;&s;ion.
The king was &s;till in the palace of Linlith|gow,
where the lord Kennedy one of the re|gents,
(and no friend of the Boyds,) kept a ve|ry
watchful eye over him; the lord Boyd
therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary for his own in|tere&s;t,
to have his maje&s;ty out of lord Ken|nedy's
hands, which, by the blind of a hunt|ing-match,
(no doubt with his maje&s;ty's ap|probation)
he accompli&s;hed, and got him &s;afe|ly
conducted to Edinburgh, much again&s;t the
lord Kennedy's inclination, but where he was
afterwards entirely under the direction of the
Boyds.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="390">
However, lord Boyd, like a wife &s;tate&s;man,
prevailed with the king to call a parliament,
wherein it was declared, that the lord Boyd
had done the king and country good &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
in bringing his maje&s;ty from Linlithgow to E|dinburgh,
and he was entirely acquitted there|of;
this act of exoneration pa&s;t 25th October
1466. And further, the lord Boyd was declar|ed
governor to the young king and his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
<HI>ex con&s;en&s;u dominorum concilii no&s;tri, &amp;c.</HI> which
was al&s;o ratified in parliament.</P>
<P>Upon the death of lord Living&s;ton, he was
appointed great chamberlain of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by
a charter from the king, <HI>anno</HI> 1467.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great &s;eal, of a
va&s;t number of lands and baronies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Roberto
domino Boyd, gubernatori regni et regis, &amp;c.
inter</HI> 1466 <HI>et</HI> 1469.</P>
<P>And tho' this lord was certainly at the head
of all public affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black acts of parliament.</NOTE> yet it appears he never
acted in any great matters of &s;tate, without
the advice and concurrence of tho&s;e joined in
commi&s;&s;ion with him by parliament, &s;uch as
the king's marriage, his brother's, the duke
of Albany, earl of Mar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About this time the lord Boyd's elde&s;t &s;on,
who was certainly one of the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed
young men in the kingdom, married
lady Mary Stewart, the king's elde&s;t &s;i|&s;ter,
with the con&s;ent and approbation of his
maje&s;ty. He got by her a great acce&s;&s;ion to
his e&s;tate, and was by king James III. cre|ated
earl of Arran; this indeed greatly ag|grandized
his family, and at the &s;ame time, was
one of the cau&s;es of its being &s;o &s;oon pulled
down and brought to ruin.</P>
<P>They became greatly envied by &s;ome, and
for their exorbitant power, and their having
engro&s;&s;ed the whole authority of the nation
to them&s;elves, were as much hated by others.
And tho' there are no particular mi&s;demean|ors
or acts of oppre&s;&s;ion laid to their charge,
yet their enemies became innumerable.</P>
<P>The old lord was obliged to be much from
court, in the execution of his office of great
chamberlain; his &s;on the earl of Arran was at
Denmark upon an emba&s;&s;y, and his lady with
him, who always accompanied him wherever
he went. The enemies of the family took
that opportunity of working their ruin. They
fir&s;t got the king's favour and affection alie|nated
from them; they then prevailed with
his maje&s;ty to call a parliament in 1469,
to which lord Boyd, his &s;on the earl of Ar|ran,
and his brother &s;ir Alexander Boyd of
Duncow, were &s;ummoned to appear, and an|&s;wer
for &s;uch crimes as &s;hould be exhibited a|gain&s;t
them. The old lord being &s;en&s;ible of
the great authority and power of the faction
that was formed again&s;t him, and being al&s;o
&s;hocked at the king's &s;o &s;uddenly withdraw|ing
his countenance from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE> did not think
fit to appear and &s;tand his trial, but retired
to England, and died at Alnwick the year
thereafter, <HI>anno</HI> 1470.</P>
<P>His &s;on the earl of Arran was out of the
kingdom, &s;o could not attend; but his bro|ther
&s;ir Alexander, tru&s;ting to his own inno|cence,
appeared and &s;tood his trial. The
chief crime of which they were all accu&s;ed,
was their carrying off the king from Linlith|gow
to Edinburgh, which was declared trea|&s;on;
and tho' they were all acquitted for that
crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of parlia|ment.</NOTE> by act of parliament <HI>anno</HI> 1466, as be|fore
ob&s;erved, yet the torrent again&s;t them
was now become &s;o violent, that the old lord
and his &s;on were found guilty of trea&s;on, con|demned
in ab&s;ence, and all their e&s;tates and
honours were forfeited to the crown. Sir A|lexander
who &s;tood his trial, was found guil|ty
art and part of carrying the king from
Linlithgow, condemned, and executed on the
Ca&s;tle-hill, <HI>anno</HI> 1469. A remarkable in|&s;tance
of the in&s;tability of human grandeur.</P>

<P>THE &s;irname of MacLellan is of very
great antiquity in the &s;outh of Scotland.
They had va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in lands, and were
very numerous and powerful.</P>
<P>David MacLellan is mentioned in a char|ter
of king Alexander II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Murray.</NOTE> the third year of
his reign, which was <HI>anno dom.</HI> 1217.</P>
<P>All our hi&s;torians agree, that the Mac|Lellans
of Bombie were heretable &s;heriffs of
Galloway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> flouri&s;hed with great lu&s;tre for ma|ny
ages; and there were twelve knights of
that &s;irname in the &s;outh of Scotland at one
time, of which Bombie was the chief.</P>
<P>But as there are few of them mention|ed
in our publick records, before the reign
of king James I. we &s;hall from that aera be|gin
to deduce their de&s;cent.</P>
<P>I. Sir PATRICK MACLELLAN of Bom|bie,
lived about 350 Years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes dom. Gray.</NOTE> and married
a daughter of &s;ir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth,
ance&s;tor of lord Gray, by whom he had a

upon to take part with lord Herries his rela|tion

<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI> of whom afterwards.</P>
<P>The clan MacLellan were &s;o incen&s;ed at
their chief's being &s;lain, that they all joined,
took up arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and committed va&s;t depreda|tions
upon the Dougla&s;es territories, in de|fiance
of all law and ju&s;tice, for which king
James outlawed and for&s;eited them, and the
e&s;tate of Bombie was thereupon annexed to
the crown.</P>
<P>About this time the county of Galloway
was greatly infe&s;ted with a company of rob|bers
or gyp&s;ies from Ireland, whereupon the
king i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, promi&s;ing a con|&s;iderable
reward to any who would di&s;per&s;e
them, and bring in their captain dead or alive;
which was at la&s;t performed by the &s;aid &s;ir
William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. Mac|Kenzie, Ni&s;|bet, &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;on of the la&s;t &s;ir Patrick of Bombie,
who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends, di&s;per&s;|ed
that lawle&s;s crew, killed their chie&s;tain, and
brought his head upon the point of his &s;word
to his maje&s;ty; for which gallant behaviour
the king put him immediately in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his barony of Bombie: and to perpetuate the
memory of that brave action, he took for his
cre&s;t, a Moor's head on the point of a &s;word,

<P>He was many times afterwards &s;ent as her

where he had the management of affairs of
the utmo&s;t importance; and though his nego|tiations
were &s;ometimes not attended with the

with fidelity and good conduct.</P>
<P>In 1561 he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Eng|land,

by an able &s;tate&s;man, it could not be

<P>In 1563, he was &s;ent to endeavour to get
queen Mary declared heir to the crown of Eng|land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's hi&s;t. p. 235, 236. and 237.</NOTE>

his reputation for wi&s;dom and integrity made

<P>XIV. JOHN, &s;econd earl of Lauderdale, a
man of great abilities, and &s;ingular accompli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>According to my lord Clarendon, he was
deeply engaged with the covenanters in the
beginning of the civil war, and, when a young
man, was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed
by the church of Scotland to meet with the
a&s;&s;embly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in 1643,
in order to new-model the government of the
church.</P>
<P>In 1644, he was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners
from the e&s;tates of Scotland, to treat with
the king at Uxbridge; but that treaty taking
no effect, he was again commi&s;&s;ioned by the
parliament to treat with his maje&s;ty at Hamp|ton-Court,

the rai&s;ing an army to re&s;cue the king, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When the Scots were ready to march into
England, the earl was &s;ent over to Holland,
to endeavour to prevail with the prince of
Wales to repair to the Scotch army; but it
could not po&s;&s;ibly be accompli&s;hed at that
time. Before the earl got back to Scotland,
the bloody tragedy of his maje&s;ty's murder
was perpetrated, and the earl returned direct|ly
to Holland, to offer his &s;ervice to the prince
of Wales, now king Charles II. and was mo&s;t
graciou&s;ly received.</P>
<P>In 1650, the king came to Scotland, and
the earl accompanied him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's hi&s;tory, v. III. p. 286.</NOTE> but (according to
the noble hi&s;torian) duke Hamilton and he
were obliged to conceal them&s;elves among&s;t
their friends for &s;ome time after the king
landed, they being both very di&s;agreeable to
Argyle and the covenanters, who ruled all
at that time.</P>
<P>After the parliament at Stirling in 1651,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 308.</NOTE>
all parties were (in appearance) heartily u|nited
in the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty; and now
duke Hamilton and Lauderdale &s;eemed to have
mo&s;t of the king's confidence.</P>
<P>Lauderdale never after left his maje&s;ty, till
the fatal battle of Worce&s;ter, where he was
taken pri&s;oner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibident.</NOTE> &s;ent to the tower of London,
underwent a &s;evere confinement of nine years,
till he was relea&s;ed by the re&s;toration of king
Charles II. <HI>anno</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>After which, in recompence of his &s;uffer|ings,
and on account of his great learning
and knowledge in the management of affairs
of &s;tate, he became the king's fir&s;t favourite,
and prime mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>He was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, pre&s;ident
of the council, heretable high &s;heriff of the
county of Edinburgh, one of the extraordina|ry
lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the
trea&s;ury, one of the lords of his maje&s;ty's
bed-chamber, lord high commi&s;&s;ioner to the
parliament, and governor of Edinburgh ca&s;tle.</P>

On &s;econd May 1672, he was created

<P>THE Iri&s;h antiquaries claim the honour
of the origin of this noble family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Kea|tine, Peter Wal&s;h, &amp;c.</NOTE> and
a&s;&s;ert, that their fir&s;t ance&s;tor came from Ire|land.</P>
<P>Some Scotch authors alledge, that they are
de&s;cended from Alexander, &s;econd &s;on of Ken|neth
thane of Lochaber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Sim&s;on's e&s;&s;ays. Hi&s;t. of the Stew|arts, &amp;c.</NOTE> and immediate young|er
brother of Bancho, predece&s;&s;or of the Scotch
royal family.</P>
<P>But the following narration will make it
plainly appear, that they came from Eng|land.</P>
<P>Although upon the great victory obtained
by William duke of Normandy (afterwards
called the Conqueror) over Harold king of
England, at Ha&s;tings, in October 1066, all
the &s;outhern provinces of England &s;ubmitted
quietly to the government of the victor; yet
&s;everal earls, great lords, and powerful ba|rons,
in the northern provinces, much attach|ed
to their old race of kings, and impatient
of &s;ervitude, &s;tood up valiantly in defence of
their liberties, and the independency of their
country; and having carried on a bloody, but
un&s;ucce&s;sful, war again&s;t the Conqueror, whom
they looked upon as an u&s;urper, were at la&s;t
compelled to leave their country, abandon
their e&s;tates, and &s;ave their lives by flying to
Scotland, where they were kindly received
by king Malcolm III. as will be &s;hown here|after.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent of the&s;e families was,
the ance&s;tor of the Dunbars earls of March,
who are treated of under that title, page 437
of this work.</P>
<P>The next was the progenitor of the old
earls of Lennox, of whom we are now to
give an account.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them we can fix upon, with
any certainty, is</P>
<P>1. AYKFRITH, or EGFRITH, an Engli&s;h
Saxon lord, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great e|&s;tate
in Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi|tali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> which, with Cum|berland
and We&s;tmorland, belonged to the
Scots for &s;everal generations: it is therefore
probable, that he was of Scotch extract. He
had al&s;o the lord&s;hips of Dent and Sadbergh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">by du|catus Loidien|&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, p. 71.</NOTE>
in York-&s;hire, and was cotemporary with the
kings Canute and Edward the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>He made a great addition to his paternal
e&s;tate, by the marriage of Eck&s;rida, a rich
York-&s;hire heire&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doom&s;day book in regi|&s;tro honoris de Richmond.</NOTE> with whom he got va&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> the lands and baronies of
Askrig, Holteby, Marrig, Burgh, Ilkton, New|ton,
Taulield, Wath, Melmorby, Normanby,
with &s;everal others, all in the &s;ame county.</P>
<P>He died about the year 1064, and left i&s;|&s;ue
a &s;on,</P>
<P>II. ARKYLL, or ARKILL, who &s;ucceeded
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and, in old records, is de&s;igned Arkill
chevalier, the &s;on of Egfrith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or not only of all the above
baronies in York-&s;hire, but al&s;o of the lands
of Hakeford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> Hornebye, Layburn, Brumpton,
Carthorp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the &s;ame county.</P>
<P>He had likeways a great e&s;tate in Nor|thumberland,
which appears from a cotempo|rary
author, who mentions him as one of the
mo&s;t powerful men in that country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi|talis, ad ann. 1068. Hi&s;tor. Normann. &s;criptores, p. 511.</NOTE> accord|ing
to the&s;e remarkable words: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Arkyllus
Nordankymbrorum potenti&s;&s;imus, cum rege
concordiam fecit, eique filium &s;uum ob&s;idem

<P>He married Sigrida, daughter to a power|ful
baron in York-&s;hire, <HI>viz. Kilvert filius Li|gulfi,</HI>
by Ekfrida his wife, daughter of Aldu|nus
bi&s;hop of Durham, by which it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simon Dun|elmen&s;is, p. 80.</NOTE>
that the celibacy of the clergy had not then
obtained in England. By her he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>Co&s;patrick,</HI> who marrying the daughter
of Dolphin, the &s;on of Torphin, had a &s;on,
Co&s;patrick, cotemporary with Simon of Dur|ham;
a de&s;cendant of which Co&s;patrick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doom&s;day book, ap|pendix, p. 61.</NOTE> by an
heir-female, was Adam de Steavolay, who
&s;ucceeded to his York-&s;hire e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Arkyll being a great &s;ticklet for the old
Saxon race, bore a principal &s;hare in all the
in&s;urrections again&s;t William the Conqueror;
and being defeated by him, <HI>anno</HI> 1067, was
obliged to give his &s;on Co&s;patrick an ho&s;tage
for his fidelity, who being too young to have
been concerned in his father's con&s;piracies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
got a good &s;hare of his York-&s;hire e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Another dangerous in&s;urrection having
been rai&s;ed again&s;t the Conqueror, by the
Northern counties, in the year 1068, Arkyll
joined heartily in it; and being again defeat|ed,
was forfeited, and obliged to leave Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi|talis, p 513. etSimon Dun|elmen&s;is, p. 82.</NOTE>
according to the&s;e words of the &s;aid
author, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eodem tamen anno Arkyllus fuit in|ter

a conque&s;tore in exilium actus e&s;t, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Arkyll fled to Scotland to king Malcolm
C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nmore, who having married Margaret, &s;i|&s;ter
to Edgar Atheling, the true and lineal
heir of the Engli&s;h crown, received all the

<PB N="399" REF="414">
to their birth, merit, and the lo&s;&s;es they had
&s;u&s;tained in England, on account of their
loyalty</P>
<P>Arkyll obtained from that king a large
tract of land in the &s;hires of Dunbarton and
Stirling, which was afterwards erected into
the earldom of Lennox, in favours of Alwin
Mac Arkyll his grand-&s;on.</P>
<P>From this Arkyll his de&s;cendents, the old
earls of Lennox, are denominated by the Gae|lic
bards and &s;enachies, <HI>Siol Arkyll, i. e.</HI> the
po&s;terity of Arkyll.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid he married a Scotch lady to his

<P>Though we cannot fix upon the preci&s;e

happened in the reign of king Malcolm, who
died <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>The earl was &s;ucceeded in his whole e&s;tates

William (who &s;ucceeded king Malcolm) as
&s;uperior of the earldom of Lennox, gave the
ward thereof, during earl Alwin's minority,
to his own brother, David earl of Hunting|ton

harbour and fi&s;hing contiguous thereto. The
earl immediately made a &s;urrender of the whole
earldom into the king's hands, and thereup|on
obtained a new charter, dated in 1238,
in which neither the ca&s;tle nor territory were

<P>As &s;oon as Robert earl of Carrick (after|wards

<P>He obtained from that great prince many

in a direct male-line.</P>
<P>XI. MARGARET, only child of earl Do|nald,
&s;ucceeded to the e&s;tate of Lennox by

which he could not give, and neither

<P>The above mentioned heirs portioners had

favours of the family of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nly, <HI>anno</HI> 1477,
whereby that earldom came to the Stewarts;
and, in con&s;equnence of the above de&s;cent, the
Stewarts of Darnly, and Haldanes of Glen|eagles,
quarter the arms of Lennox with their
own; but the Napiers of Merchi&s;ton have e|ver
&s;ince a&s;&s;umed the arms of Lennox, in

<P>By the preceeding narration it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet. vol. I. p. 139.</NOTE>
that the earldom of Lennox, according to the
above mentioned entail, went in a regular
cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the lawful heirs of line
of that antient family, which is fully in&s;truc|ted
by the above indi&s;putable documents; and
if earl Duncan had had a &s;on lawfully born,
he would have had a ju&s;t and undoubted right
to both the e&s;tate and title of earl of Lennox,
in which ca&s;e the female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion could ne|ver

<P>Yet we mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that the &s;aid

<P>In 1642, he was &s;ent over to Ireland with
&s;ome forces, to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection in
that country; and returning in 1643, had
again the command of the Scotch army that
was &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the parliament's
forces again&s;t the king; and the victory ob|tained
over his maje&s;ty's forces at Mar&s;ton|muir,
<PB N="406" REF="427">
<HI>anno</HI> 1644, was chiefly a&s;cribed to the
conduct of the earl of Leven.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the committee of

to be lord general, <HI>anno</HI> 1647.</P>
<P>He was one of the planters of kirks, and
had a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion &s;ettled on him, be|&s;ides
1529l. <HI>per</HI> month for the payment of
his troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> including trumpeters, kettle drums,
<HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1649.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what is above ob&s;erved,
his after-behaviour would induce one to be|lieve,
that his real principles were rather loy|al
than otherways; and that, had he imagin|ed
the parliament would have driven matters
to &s;uch extremities, he would not have been
&s;o hearty in their intere&s;t; yet a reverend
author &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me|moirs.</NOTE> that he was one of the peers that
&s;at in the parliament in January 1649, and
did nothing to hinder the king's murder.</P>
<P>However, none appeared more forward
than the earl of Leven afterwards for rai&s;ing
an army, and re&s;toring king Charles II.</P>
<P>He &s;erved as a volunteer again&s;t Oliver
Cromwell at the battle of Dunbar, and hear|tily
joined and concurred with the loyali&s;ts
in every mea&s;ure for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing our old
con&s;titution in church and &s;tate; but when
he, with others of the loyal party, had a
meeting in Angus, to concert matters for
their future conduct, general Monk, who
then be&s;ieged Dundee, having got intelligence
of their meeting, &s;ent a &s;trong party in the
night, &s;urpri&s;ed and took them all pri&s;oners
at Alyth in Angus, and &s;ent the old general,
with &s;everal others, pri&s;oners to London,
where they were confined in the tower.</P>
<P>And though he had been long a faithful
&s;ervant to the parliament, yet he did not
meet with the lea&s;t favour from Oliver Crom|well
on that account; but &s;uffered &s;eque&s;tra|tion,
and many other hard&s;hips, till at la&s;t,
by the mediation of the queen of Sweden, he
obtained his liberty, and was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
the &s;ervice her maje&s;ty had done him, that
he went over to Sweden in per&s;on, to make
his acknowledgments, where he was received,

<HEAD>KER Marquis of LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the noble and illu&s;trious name of
Ker is of very great antiquity in Scot|land,
appears from many authentic docu|ments.</P>
<P>Some deduce them from a noble family of
that &s;irname in France, one whereof came o|ver
to England with William the Conqueror,
had a con&s;iderable command in his army, and
afterwards &s;ettled in England; in confirmati|on
of which they alledge, that baron Ker, and
&s;everal other families of that &s;irname, now
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting in France, trace their origin even
higher than that aera.</P>
<P>Others are of opinion, that Ker is a local
&s;irname, and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed by the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors
of the lands and baronies of Ker and Ker&s;|hall,
in Lanca&s;hire, where &s;everal families of
that name have made a con&s;iderable figure for
many ages pa&s;t: But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
that the Kers in England and France have the
very &s;ame armorial bearings; &s;o whether they
came from France to England, or from Eng|land
<PB N="417" REF="438">
to France, we &s;hall not pretend to deter|mine.</P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie, that learned and
judicious antiquary, is of opinion, that the
Kers fir&s;t &s;ettled in the &s;outh parts of Scot|land
about the year 1330; but it is mo&s;t cer|tain
they were a numerous and flouri&s;hing fa|mily
in this country long before that time;
for we find many of that &s;irname &s;wearing
fealty to king Edward I. of England, betwixt
the years 1291 and 1297, for lands lying in
different parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Henricus Ker &s;wore fealty in 1296.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col|lect vol. III. p. 657.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nicol Ker ditto, Prynne, ibid. page 660.</P>
<P>Andrew del Ker&mdash;, ibid. page 661.</P>
<P>Willielmus Ker, who &s;wore fealty for lands

of the Kers of Ker&s;land.</P>
<P>Thomas Ker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>miles, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie mentions two bro|thers
of that &s;irname, who &s;ettled in the &s;outh
parts of Scotland, <HI>viz.</HI> Ralph and Robert Kers;
but whether they came from England or
France, or were &s;ons of any of the above|named
Kers, he does not determine; but
thinks that Ralph, ance&s;tor of the Kers of Fer|nyhir&s;t,
was the elde&s;t brother, becau&s;e that
family carried the &s;ame arms with the Kers
in England and France, without any difference
either of tincture or charge. We &s;hall there|fore
follow that great author, and deduce
their de&s;cent according to his account.</P>
<P>I. RALPH KER, who &s;ettled in Teviotdale

<P>Before we return to &s;ir Andrew's third

made an entail of his e&s;tate and honours, with
con&s;ent of the crown, in con&s;equence of the
above-mentioned patent, in favours of Willi|am
lord Newbottle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mac Kenzie's collect. in the lawiers libra|ry, et chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> &s;on of Robert, then earl,

heir-male; and after him to the elde&s;t &s;on of

peerage for ever; by which entail and
confirmation it is provided, that albeit the el|de&s;t
&s;on of that family bear the title of lord
Jedburgh, and thereby have the privilege of
a peer, yet it &s;hall not prejudge him as to the
precedency due to the elde&s;t &s;on of the fami|ly
of Lothian. This deed is dated 11th of
July 1670.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when William lord Newbottle
&s;ucceeded to Robert third lord Jedburgh, in
virtue of the above entail, he took his place
in parliament as lord Jedburgh; and the el|de&s;t
&s;ons of the family of Lothian have &s;ince
that time exerted the &s;ame privilege of &s;itting

which appears from the parliament rolls

the election 1712.</P>
<P>As then the e&s;tate and honours of Jedburgh,

upon William lord Newbottle, his next

<P>Earl William was a man of great honour
and integrity; and though he was on the par|liament's
&s;ide during the greate&s;t part of king
Charles I. his troubles, yet he had the utmo&s;t
abhorrence of the barbarous treatment the king
met with from the parliament of England.</P>

commi&s;&s;ioners from the e&s;tates of Scotland, to
treat with the Engli&s;h in behalf of the king;
and though Oliver Cromwell had, by that
time, expelled mo&s;t of the members of both
hou&s;es of parliament, and was then perfectly
ma&s;ter of the rump, yet he remon&s;trated in the
name of the whole kingdom of Scotland, a|gain&s;t
the u&s;ing any violence or indignity up|on
the &s;acred per&s;on of the king: He added, that
the whole nation had the very thoughts thereof
in the utmo&s;t abhorrence and dete&s;tation, and
took a &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t their proceed|ings;
but all his hone&s;t endeavours proved
fruitle&s;s; upon which the earl tran&s;mitted to
the e&s;tates of Scotland an account of what he
had done, and his conduct was highly approv|ed
of.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, the earl conti|nued
&s;teady in his loyalty to his &s;on king Charles
II. and contributed all that was in his power
towards his re&s;toration, and was one of the

agreed to the marriage of queen Margaret with
prince Edward of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1289.</P>
<P>He is often in publick records de&s;igned &s;ir
Simon <HI>pater,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h him from &s;ir Simon
his &s;on, particularly when he was one of the
auditors of the debate in the competition for

<P>He died &s;oon thereafter, leaving i&s;&s;ue two
&s;ons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> who carried on the line

<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>IV. Sir SIMON FRASER of Oliver-ca&s;tle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who is acknowledged by all Scotch hi&s;torians
to have been one of the greate&s;t heroes of his
time, and performed many great and glorious
actions, in defence of the liberties of his coun|try.</P>
<P>He was lieutenant-general of the Scotch
forces when &s;ir John Cummin of Badenach
was guardian of the kingdom; and it is well
known how the&s;e two, with &s;carce 10,000
Scots, defeated three Engli&s;h armies in one
day, each of them of equal, if not &s;uperior,
numbers to them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 552.</NOTE> near Ro&s;lin, <HI>anno</HI>
1303, and Dr. Abercrombie attributes the
glory gained by the Scots on that day chief|ly
to the remarkable courage and conduct of
&s;ir Simon.</P>
<P>As it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the brevity of
this work, to enumerate all the glorious ac|tions
of this great man, we &s;hall only add,
that he was at la&s;t taken pri&s;oner, and &s;ent to
London, where king Edward mo&s;t cruelly
put him to death, he leaving i&s;&s;ue only two
daughters, the one married to the ance&s;tor of
the marquis of Tweeddale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MacKenzie, Nisbet, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the other to
the predece&s;&s;or of the family of Wigton. In

have continued to quarter the arms of
Fra&s;er with their own.</P>
<P>Sir Simon dying without male-i&s;&s;ue, the

Alexander before mentioned, to whom we

<P>IV. Sir ALEXANDER FRASER, &s;econd &s;on

<P>King Robert being perfectly &s;en&s;ible of

to inherit the virtues of his worthy ance&s;tors,

in defence of the liberties of his country, even

<P>He became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the barony of Lo|vat,

<P>He commanded the left wing of the royal

obtained a glorious victory over Haco king
of Norway, who had invaded Scotland with a
great army, <HI>anno</HI> 1263.</P>
<P>The year thereafter, the earl of March,
with the lord high &s;teward, reduced the I&s;le
of Man, with all the Ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">udae or We&s;tern
I&s;les; and in 1266, Magnus king of Norway,
yielded all preten&s;ions to tho&s;e i&s;lands, for
4000 merks, and an annuity of 100 merks,
which brought about the marriage betwixt
Eric, &s;on of Magnus, with prince&s;s Margaret,
daughter of king Alexander III.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1284, this earl was one of the <HI>mag|nates
Scotiae</HI> that entered into a &s;olemn engage|ment,
acknowledging prince&s;s Margaret, daugh|ter
to Eric king of Norway, to be true and
undoubted heir to the crown of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. II. p. 266, &amp; 284.</NOTE> and
to receive her as queen, upon the death of
king Alexander III. her grandfather.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o one of the Scotch nobles that
wrote to the king of England about the mar|riage
of Margaret queen of Scotland with his
elde&s;t &s;on prince Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>After the death of the queen, he became
one of the competitors for the crown, as be|ing
grand&s;on of Ada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 553.</NOTE> daughter of king Willi|am
the Lion, but it &s;eems he afterwards gave
up his preten&s;ions; for in the competition be|twixt
Bruce and Baliol, we find this earl of
March was one of the arbiters cho&s;en on the
part of Bruce, <HI>anno</HI> 1292.</P>
<P>He died 1294, having married Chri&s;tian
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi|&s;tory, p. 34.</NOTE> daughter of Robert lord of Annandale,
competitor for the crown of Scotland, by
whom he had a &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,</P>

&s;ubmit to the &s;uperior power of king Edward
of England, and &s;wore fealty to him, <HI>anno</HI>
1296.</P>
<P>In 1304, the parliament of England cho&s;e
him one of the repre&s;entatives for Scotland,
but the Scotch affairs beginning then to have a
more favourable a&s;pect, he refu&s;ed to &s;erve in
&s;uch a parliament, though he had lands lying
both in Scotland and England.</P>
<P>Soon after Robert Bruce was king of Scot|land,
we find him in the enemy's intere&s;t, his
&s;trong ca&s;tle of Dunbar in the hands of the
Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. tom. III. p&punc; 14.</NOTE> and him&s;elf appointed by king Ed|ward

the Engli&s;h borders, <HI>viz.</HI> Lanca&s;hire, Cum|berland,
We&s;tmorland, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1307; yet
he was afterwards reconciled, and in great
friend&s;hip with king Robert, and was one of
the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> that attended him to his
convention at Air, when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
crown was &s;ettled, to which he affixed his
&s;eal, <HI>anno</HI> 1315.</P>
<P>He married Marian, daughter of Duncan,

<P>1. <HI>Patrick,</HI> tenth earl of March.</P>

<P>He died in the end of 1315, or beginning
of 1316, and was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XIII. PATRICK, &s;ixth of that name, and
tenth earl, who was a man of great honour,
loyalty, and integrity, and always a firm friend
to the royal family.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles that &s;ign|ed
that famous letter to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> a&s;&s;erting

<P>Upon the death of Thomas Randolph, re|gent

<P>This earl was afterwards employed in ma|ny

<P>XIV. GEORGE, eleventh earl of March,
de&s;igned al&s;o earl of Murray, and lord of An|nandale
in right of his mother, was certainly
one of the mo&s;t powerful men of his time, and
continued a dutiful and loyal &s;ubject during all
the reign of king Robert II.</P>
<P>He was warden of the marches, and was
very &s;ucce&s;sful in repre&s;&s;ing the in&s;olences of
the Engli&s;h borderers.</P>
<P>In 1380, he was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners
appointed to treat of a peace with England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE>
which ended only in a truce.</P>
<P>In 1384, he joined the earl of Douglas,
and they burnt the town of Roxburgh, took
the ca&s;tle of Lochmaben, defeated the En|gli&s;h,
who had invaded the South borders, and
took a rich convoy that followed their army.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e &s;ervices, he revolted to the
Engli&s;h; for which our hi&s;torians give the
following rea&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">:</P>
<P>The earl's daughter, lady Elizabeth Dun|bar,
was contracted to David prince of Scot|land,
the king's elde&s;t &s;on, and it is &s;aid the
earl had actually paid a con&s;iderable &s;um to
the king, in part of his daughter's portion.</P>
<P>The earl of Douglas being then the great|e&s;t
man in the kingdom, propo&s;ed to the king
to marry the prince to his daughter lady Mar|jory
Douglas, which accordingly was accom|pli&s;hed,
notwith&s;tanding the former contract.</P>
<P>The earl of March being a man of a great
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit, highly re&s;ented this affront, turned an
enemy to his country, and determined to do
it all the mi&s;chief in his power.</P>
<P>He committed the care of his ca&s;tle of
Dunbar to his nephew &s;ir Robert Maitland
of Leithington, renounced his allegiance to
his lawful &s;overeign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> withdrew to England
with a con&s;iderable retinue of his friends and
followers, was well received by king Henry,
who gave him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal lands, and
&s;ettled an annuity of 500 merks &s;terling up|on
him, became a liege man to the king of
England, and did him many &s;ignal &s;ervices a|gain&s;t
his native country.</P>
<P>He entered into a &s;trict friend&s;hip with &s;ir
Henry Piercy, and other Engli&s;h borderers,
the con&s;tant enemies of the Scotch nation, and
with them invaded Scotland with a con&s;ide|rable
force, made great havock, and de&s;troy-all
with fire and &s;word wherever he came;
for which he was mo&s;t ju&s;tly outlawed and
forfeited: and being one of the be&s;t generals
of his time, the Engli&s;h gained &s;everal ad|vantages
over the Scots under his conduct,
particularly at Homildon, in 1402, and at the
battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, where the vic|tory
was chiefly a&s;cribed to the earl of March's
military skill.</P>
<P>After all, he became weary of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
his native country, and made application to
Robert duke of Albany, governor of Scot|land,
for a pardon, who gave him a favour|able
an&s;wer; upon which he came to Scot|land,
and was re&s;tored to all his e&s;tates and
honours by the governor, <HI>anno</HI> 1409, and liv|ed
peaceably in his own country all the re|mainder
of his days.</P>
<P>He married Chri&s;tian, daughter of &s;ir Wil|liam

His daughter, lady <HI>Janet,</HI> married, 1&s;t, to
John lord Seton; and, 2dly, to &s;ir Adam
John&s;ton of that ilk.</P>
<P>The earl died in 1416, and was &s;ucceeded
by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XV. GEORGE, twelfth earl of March, who
was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to
treat with the Engli&s;h about the redemption
of king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1423, which was hap|pily
accompli&s;hed the year thereafter, and the
earl had the honour of knighthood conferred
upon him at the &s;olemnity of the king's co|ronation.</P>
<P>Though it does not appear that this earl
was ever guilty of any bad practices again&s;t
the &s;tate, yet the ravages and deva&s;tations,
committed by his father again&s;t his country,
during his rebellion, made many good &s;ub|jects
enemies to his family. They endea|voured
to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the king again&s;t him, and
to convince him that it was not in the power
of a governor to re&s;tore to his e&s;tate, and
fully to pardon &s;o great and formidable a re|bel
as his father was, who had been ju&s;tly
outlawed and forfeited by the Iaws of the
land.</P>
<P>The earl was apprehended, and committed
pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; but the
king would &s;uffer nothing to be done again&s;t
him contrary to law: he therefore called a
parliament to meet at Perth, in order for his
trial, on 10th January 1434.</P>
<P>The earl pled, that his father had been
fully pardoned by the duke of Albany, then
governor of Scotland, and that he had never
been guilty of any crime again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The advocates for the king replied, that
the power of re&s;toring rebels and exiles was
lodged in the king alone, and never in the
per&s;on of a governor.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, after long debate, the parliament
pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence again&s;t him, in the&s;e words:
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Quod ratione forisfacturae domini Georgii de

<P>The earldom of March was thus annexed

<P>Yet &s;uch was the king's goodne&s;s and
bounty to this earl, that he be&s;towed upon
him a pen&s;ion out of the earldom of Buchan,
(then in the crown) which &s;upported him ac|cording
to his quality during his life.</P>

<P>AFTER the forfeiture of the earl of

in the crown, till king James III. be&s;towed
it upon his brother Alexander duke of Alba|ny,

for rebellion, that title was again annexed to
the crown, where it continued till king James
VI. conferred it upon,</P>

of Lennox, by lady Anne Stewart his wife,
daughter of John earl of Athole.</P>

<P>In the year 1576, the honours of earl of

his nephew Charles; but as he had no law|ful

he had the title of March conferred upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>

<P>He had an education &s;uitable to his birth,
and was cho&s;en knight for the &s;hire of Ber|wick,
to the parliament 1665, where he &s;oon

<P>In 1685, he came over to Scotland with

of that rebellion, he narrowly e&s;caped being

where he remained, till he came over with

immediately named one of the new privy

<P>He was con&s;tituted &s;heriff-principal of Ber|wick-&s;hire,

lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>anno</HI> 1693, lord high

<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of queen Anne to the

<P>As his commi&s;&s;ions of lord chancellor and
&s;heriff of Berwick tell upon the death of king
William, her maje&s;ty queen Anne immediate|ly
conferred the fir&s;t upon the earl of Seafield,

earl of Marchmont continued to act with the
&s;ame publick &s;pirit as formerly, and in the fir&s;t
parliament of queen Ange, <HI>anno</HI> 1703, he
moved to bring in a bill, for &s;ettling the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion

this motion was dropped at that time.</P>
<P>He was a great promoter of the union, the

than which he had nothing more at
heart.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king George I. to the

the union. In 1704, he was made one of
the &s;enators of the college of ju&s;tice in Scot|land,
and &s;oon after one of the privy-coun|cil
and exchequer. His place in the &s;e&s;&s;ion

upon his being appointed, in March
1715, envoy extraordinary to the courts of
Denmark and Pru&s;&s;ia. In December 1716, he
was made clerk regi&s;ter for Scotland.</P>
<P>In January 1721, he was appointed fir&s;t

magnificence becoming the Briti&s;h nation.</P>

was inve&s;ted with the mo&s;t noble order of the

<P>In 1726, he was &s;worn one of the privy

<HEAD>KEITH Earl MARISHAL.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY and remote&s;t antiquity are
agreed, that the family of Keith is one
of the mo&s;t ancient and illu&s;trious the Scotch
nation ever has produced: a family, fruitful
in a race of great men, who, not indebted to
the nobility of their origin, have always re|flected
greater glory on their progenitors, on
the hereditary titles and offices they enjoyed,
than they ever deduced from them.</P>
<P>Our be&s;t antiquaries derive their origin from
a certain great man called Robert, who per|formed
glorious exploits again&s;t the Danes,
when they invaded Scotland with a numerous
army in the reign of king Malcolm II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, A|bercrombie, vol. 1. p. 207. Stewart's hi&s;t. of the royal family, and many other authors.</NOTE> tho' &s;ome
trace their origin much higher; however,
this hero remarkaby di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at
the battle of Barry or Camu&s;tone in Angus,
where, with his own hand, he killed the fa|mous
Camus, general and champion of the
Dani&s;h army, whereby the Scots gained a
compleat victory, <HI>anno</HI> 1010.</P>
<P>King Malcolm, in recompence of his great
and &s;ignal &s;ervices, be&s;towed upon him &s;everal
lands, particularly the barony of Keith in Ea&s;t-Lothian,
from which his po&s;terity a&s;&s;umed
their &s;irname. He al&s;o appointed him here|ditary
great mari&s;hal of Scotland, which high
office hath continued in his family, and hath
never been enjoyed by any other &s;ince that
time.</P>
<P>Of this great warrior was lineally de&s;cend|ed,
Herveus, or Hervieus de Keth, of whom
we have many authentic documents in the ar|chives
of the kingdom, which &s;ufficiently prove
that he was great mari&s;hal of Scotland, and
proprietor of the lands and barony of Keth;
and as he was undoubted progenitor of this il|lu&s;trious
family, from him we deduce their
de&s;cent by unque&s;tionable vouchers.</P>
<P>I. HERVEUS de KETH, great mari&s;hal of
Scotland, flouri&s;hed in the reign of king Da|vid
I. who &s;ucceeded to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1124,
and died <HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>This Herveus had a di&s;pute with the abbot
and convent of Kel&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kel&s;o, penes MacFarlane, p. 72.</NOTE> who claimed the church
of Keth, in the village of this Herveus, de|&s;igned
<HI>Herveus de Keth mare&s;callus regis Sco|tiae,</HI>

which J. bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, and R. abbot of
Jedworth, are witne&s;&s;es, <HI>inter annos</HI> 1164 <HI>et</HI>
1174, in which la&s;t year the bi&s;hop died.</P>
<P>That there had been many meetings and
conventions about this conte&s;t, &s;ufficiently
appears from the writs in the chartulary of
Kel&s;o.</P>

and Keith-Mari&s;hal; the other, which
&s;ometime belonged to the Fra&s;ers, was called
Keith-Symons, or Keith-Hundely (now Hum|by;)
but the great mari&s;hals &s;oon became
proprietors of both, as will be &s;hown here|after.</P>

died betwixt the years 1190 and 1195, and
was father of</P>

a quick promotion there, he entered into the

of his country, at the battle of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI>
1332, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>XI. THOMAS, thirteenth earl of Marr, al&s;o a
man of great abilities, a faithful and loyal
&s;ubject of king David Bruce, in all the vari|ous
vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in that long reign,
during which there was &s;carce any public
tran&s;action wherein the earl of Marr was not
concerned.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the amba&s;&s;adors
extraordinary by the e&s;tates of the kingdom,
to treat with the Engli&s;h about king David's
liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p. 711.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1351.</P>
<P>He was one of the ho&s;tages for his ran&s;om,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. VI. P. 212, and 323.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1357, and was con&s;tituted great cham|berlain
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>He was again named one of the amba&s;&s;a|dors
to treat with the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1362.</P>
<P>He was afterwards one of the guarantees
of a treaty with that nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 395, 633, 760, &amp; tom. VII. p. 30.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1369, and
again got a &s;afe conduct to go up to England
to negotiate, <HI>anno</HI> 1373, and returned the
year thereafter.</P>
<P>This earl obtained a charter of confirmati|on
from king David II. to him and his heirs
what&s;omever, of the whole lands and lord&s;hip
of Garrioch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chivis fam. de Marr.</NOTE> to be holden by him and his
heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as freely as David earl of Hunt|ington
held the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are among&s;t the archives of the fa|mily
of Marr, many charters to their friends,
and va&s;&s;als, which do great honour to, and is a
good proof of the grandeur of, this noble fa|mily;
but they are too numerous to be here
in&s;erted.</P>
<P>This earl married, 1&s;t, Mary, daughter
and heire&s;s of Alan earl of Menteith, from
whom, according to a good author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 150.</NOTE> he was
divorced upon fal&s;e and unju&s;t grounds.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Margaret Stewart,
daughter, and at la&s;t &s;ole heire&s;s, of Thomas
earl of Angus, who, after his death, mar|ried
to her &s;econd husband William earl
of Douglas, and by him was mother of George
Douglas earl of Angus.</P>
<P>Earl Thomas dying without i&s;&s;ue, <HI>anno</HI>
1377, in him ended the whole male line of
Gratney, eleventh earl of Marr, and his e&s;tate
and honours devolved upon his only &s;i&s;ter,</P>
<P>XI. MARGARET, counte&s;s of Marr, mar|ried,
as before ob&s;erved, to William fir&s;t earl
of Douglas, who, according to the courte&s;y of
Scotland at that time, became earl of Marr,
lord of Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in her right, and was
fourteenth earl.</P>
<P>There are innumerable charters and other

Douglas and Marr, as well as in Rymer's

or by force, was now altered and &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>This earl was truly a man of great parts
and magnanimity, equally skilled in the arts
of peace and war.</P>
<P>He was appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordina|ry
to treat of a peace with the court of Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom, VIII. p. 450, and 461.</NOTE>
and got a &s;afe conduct from that crown

<P>He got another &s;afe conduct to go up to

<P>He had the chief command of the royal ar|my

Harlaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. and p. 361&s;t of this work.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1411, where he behaved with
the valour and conduct of a brave and expe|rienced
general.</P>
<P>In the year 1416 he was again appointed
amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the court of Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IX p. 418. and tom. X. p. 491.</NOTE>
and &s;oon thereafter he was con&s;tituted
lord warden of the marches.</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abel Douglas, counte&s;s of Marr, died
<HI>anno</HI> 1419, without i&s;&s;ue, and in her ended
the whole line of Donald, only &s;on of
Gratney, eleventh earl of Marr; the repre|&s;entation
therefore of this mo&s;t noble and an|tient
family undoubtedly devolved upon Ro|bert
lord Erskme, lineally de&s;cended of lady
Helen, only daughter of the &s;aid eleventh earl,
as before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Alexander earl of Marr, in right of his
wi&s;e, in manner above-mentioned, being
a man of an enterprizing genius, became
weary of a peaceable life at home; he there|fore
rai&s;ed a large company of gentlemen,
<PB N="462" REF="483">
his followers, carried them to Flanders, and,
with them, entered into the &s;ervice of John
duke of Burgundy, where he and his follow|ers
performed &s;uch feats of chivalry at the
&s;iege of Liege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromby.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as acquired great reputa|tion
both to him&s;elf and his countrymen.</P>
<P>He then married Jean dutche&s;s or counte&s;s
of Brabant, and, in her right, claimed that &s;o|vereignty;
but the Brabanters refu&s;ing to &s;ub+mit
to the government of a foreigner, and the
counte&s;s dying within little more than a year
after their marriage, he returned home great|ly
incen&s;ed again&s;t the Brabanters.</P>
<P>He therefore immediately fitted out a fleet,
and failed to the coa&s;t of Flanders, where he
attacked a large fleet of the Brabanters re|turning
from Dantzick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hathornden, &amp;c.</NOTE> richly ladened, all
which he took, pillaged and de&s;troyed, and
returned to Scotland with va&s;t wealth and
booty.</P>
<P>Though this &s;ir Alexander had no right to
the earldom of Marr, but by his charters
from I&s;abel counte&s;s thereof, as is above nar|rated,
whereby the whole was limited to the
heirs to be procreated betwixt them; which
failing, to return to her heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet &s;oon
after his return to Scotland, he made a re|&s;ignation
of the earldom of Marr, lord&s;hip of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the king's hands for new
infeftment to him&s;elf, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon which the
king granted a new charter to the &s;aid &s;ir A|lexander,
and Thomas Stewart his natural
&s;on, and their heirs-male; which failing, to
the king and his heirs whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> dated 28th
May 1426.</P>
<P>Thomas, the natural &s;on, died before his
father, without i&s;&s;ue, and &s;ir Alexander him|&s;elf
died in 1435, al&s;o without lawful chil|dren;
whereupon en&s;ued a long conte&s;t about
the earldom of Marr, betwixt the king, as
having right by the re&s;ignation and charter a|bove
narrated, and Robert lord Erskine, who,
as this earldom appears to have de&s;cended to
heirs general, had an undoubted right and title
thereto; for the whole de&s;cendents of Grat|ney,
eleventh earl of Marr, were now failed,
except tho&s;e of his daughter,</P>
<P>I. Lady ELYNE, before-mentioned, who
married &s;ir John Menteith, lord of Arran, by
whom &s;he had i&s;&s;ue only one daughter,</P>
<P>II. CHRISTIAN MENTEITH, married
to &s;ir Edward Keith, to whom &s;he had an on|ly
child,</P>
<P>III. JANET KEITH, who married Tho|mas
&s;eventh lord Erskine, to whom &s;he had
i&s;&s;ue</P>
<P><HI>Robert,</HI> lord Erskine, who was undoubted
repre&s;entative and heir to one of the mo&s;t
antient earldoms in the kingdom, and was
accordingly &s;erved heir before the &s;heriff of
Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several re|tours in the archives of the family of Marr.</NOTE> 23d April 1436, to Elizabeth

<P>We &s;hall only here ob&s;erve, before we

that though the earls of Marr, as far
back as we have any records, were among&s;t

the kingdom, yet we find few or none of
their de&s;cendents who a&s;&s;umed Marr for their
&s;irname.</P>

<HEAD>ERSKINE Earl of MARR.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our antiquaries agree, that this no|ble
family is of very great antiquity;
but the hi&s;tory of its origin, like that of
mo&s;t other antient families, is chiefly found|ed
on tradition.</P>
<P>Some authors deduce their de&s;cent from a
noble Florentine, who is &s;aid to have come
to Scotland in the reign of king Kenneth II.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by others, that in the reign of
king Malcolm II. a Scot&s;man of high di&s;tinc|tion
having killed, with his own hand, En|rique,
one of the Dani&s;h generals, at the bat|tle
of Murthill, cut off his head, and, with
the bloody dagger in his hand, &s;hewed it to
the king, and, in the Gaelic, &s;aid, Eris-skyne,
alluding to the head and dagger, and, in the
&s;ame language, al&s;o &s;aid, I intend to perform
greater actions than what I have done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="463" REF="484">
whereupon king Malcolm impo&s;ed upon him
the &s;irname of Erskyne, and a&s;&s;igned him for
his armorial bearing, a hand holding a dagger,
with <HI>je pen&s;e plus</HI> for a motto, which hath
continued to be the cre&s;t and motto of this
noble family ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no further on the&s;e tra|ditional
accounts, and &s;hall here only ob&s;erve,
that it is mo&s;t certain that this family had
va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the &s;hires of Renfrew and
Air, in very early times, particularly the
lands, barony, and ca&s;tle of Erskine, a beau|tiful
&s;eat upon the banks of the river Clyde.
Whether the Erskines gave their name to
their lands, or took it from them, we &s;hall
not pretend to determine; but certain it is
there is no account, either from records or
tradition, of any per&s;ons being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
lands of Erskine before them.</P>

<P>VI. Sir ROBERT, who was &s;ixth lord of
Erskine, a great patriot, a brave &s;oldier, and
an able &s;tate&s;man, as eminently loyal and faith|ful
<PB N="464" REF="485">
to king David Bruce, as his father had
been to king Robert.</P>
<P>In king David's minority, he joined the
lord high &s;teward, and was very in&s;trumental
in recovering a great part of the country for
that prince, which had been over-run by the
Engli&s;h and the Baliol party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE> while David was
in France.</P>
<P>After his return home, the king, &s;en&s;ible of
the great merit and faithful &s;ervices of the lord
Erskine, appointed him con&s;table, keeper
and captain of the ca&s;tle of Stirling for life,
with all the privileges, devoirs, duties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which any of his predece&s;&s;ors, keepers there|of,
enjoyed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and that office continued in this
family till the attainder of earl John, in 1715.</P>
<P>After the unfortunate battle of Durham,
<HI>Robertus dominus de Erskine, miles,</HI> was ap|pointed,
by the e&s;tates of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p 618.</NOTE> one of the
amba&s;&s;adors extraordinary to negotiate king
David's liberty, <HI>anno</HI> 1348.</P>
<P>And though his negotiation did not then
take effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv and lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE> he was by his maje&s;ty appointed
great chamberlain of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1350.</P>
<P>In the years 1351, 1352, and 1354, he
was again nominated one of the amba&s;&s;adors
to treat of the king's liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p. 711, 736, &amp; 791.</NOTE> in the la&s;t of
which years he offered him&s;elf and his &s;on as
ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>In the year 1355,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 362.</NOTE> he went amba&s;&s;ador
from the e&s;tates of Scotland to the Pope.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o one of the amba&s;&s;adors in
1357,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom VI. p. 17, &amp; 35.</NOTE> when the king's liberty was accom|pli&s;hed,
and gave his &s;on as one of the ho|&s;tages
for his ran&s;om.</P>
<P>This noble lord got a charter from Tho|mas,
thirteenth earl of Marr, <Q REND="inline">"to and in &s;a|vours
of his &s;pecial con&s;ederate and cou&s;in,
Robert lord Erskine, and Chri&s;tian Keith

charter is confirmed by king David in a par|liament
held at Scoon, <HI>anno regni</HI> 39 <HI>to</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>The king being now at liberty, and in full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom, renewed the lord
Erskine's commi&s;&s;ion as lord great chamber|lain
of Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate, &amp; writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and likeways appointed
him ju&s;ticiar benorth the river Forth, con|&s;table
and keeper of the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh
and Dunbarton.</P>
<P>In the year 1359, he was appointed am|ba&s;&s;ador
extraordinary in a very &s;olemn em|ba&s;&s;y
to the court of France, to renew the
antient league,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI.</NOTE> which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;o ma|ny
centuries betwixt the two nations.</P>
<P>He went five times amba&s;&s;ador to Eng|land,
between the years 1360 and 1366, in
which la&s;t year his two &s;ons, Thomas and A|lan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 534.</NOTE>
went with him.</P>
<P>In 1367, he was appointed warden of the
marches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 570, and writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and in this year we find him men|tioned
as heretable &s;heriff of the county of
Stirling, which probably he had by &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobility who, in
the year 1371,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 369, &amp; 382.</NOTE> ratified king Robert II.'s title
to the crown, and is &s;aid by our hi&s;torians to
have been in&s;trumental in his maje&s;ty's peace|able
acce&s;&s;ion thereto. He continued in no
le&s;s favour with that prince than he had been
with his uncle king David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv. regis David &amp; Rob. II.</NOTE> from both which
kings he obtained &s;everal charters, under the
great &s;eal, of many lands and baronies, and
had &s;everal other in&s;tances of the royal favour
and bounty conferred on him.</P>
<P>But as the brevity of this work will not

performed by this patriot in the &s;ervice of
his king and country: we mu&s;t refer our
readers to our hi&s;torians, and the lives of the
officers of &s;tate, for a more particular account
of them; and &s;hall only add, that during the
cour&s;e of a long life, he was con&s;tantly em|ployed
in the mo&s;t arduous negotiations of
&s;tate, and enjoyed the greate&s;t offices in the
kingdom, in all which he di&s;charged his duty
with great ability, honour, and fidelity, e|qually
to the &s;atisfaction of his &s;overeigns and

<P>This Thomas was a man of great ac|compli&s;hments,

indenture, and that his right &s;hould not be

to &s;ubmit all que&s;tions to be determined by a

<P>There are many other prote&s;ts taken by

betwixt this time and the year 1456; but as
they are all to the &s;ame purpo&s;e with the la&s;t
mentioned one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> it is unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert
more of them here.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in the year 1457, the king brought
a reduction again&s;t &s;ir Thomas, now lord Er|skine
(his father being then dead) of his fa|ther
lord Erskine's &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> above-mentioned,
to I&s;abel counte&s;s of Marr.</P>
<P>The heads of the reduction are, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That
lord Erskine ought not to have been &s;erved
heir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In pub. ar|chiv.</NOTE> becau&s;e there were no witne&s;&s;es who
could &s;wear to his being come of Elyne of
Marr, who was long &s;ince dead.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Becau&s;e the &s;aid &s;ervice was contra|ry
to the act of parliament, anent the king's
keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all lands or rights his ma|je&s;ty's
father was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, or had
claimed at the time of his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> Becau&s;e I&s;abel counte&s;s of Marr was

in that earldom, but Alexander Stewart
and Thomas his natural &s;on, to both whom
the king was heir.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> Becau&s;e the king him&s;elf was near|e&s;t
heir to I&s;abel counte&s;s of Marr, as being
de&s;cended from I&s;abel of Marr, king Robert
Bruce's fir&s;t queen, mother of prince&s;s Mar|jory;
and I&s;abel of Marr being elde&s;t daugh|ter
of Gratney earl of Marr, ought to be pre|ferred
to the de&s;cendents of Elyne her &s;econd
&s;i&s;ter in the earldom of Marr, which was an
indivi&s;able &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e grounds an a&s;&s;ize of error met
at Aberdeen, where the king him&s;elf was pre|&s;ent,
and they, by their verdict, dated 15th
May 1457, reduced the &s;ervice of Robert
lord Erskine; and &s;ound, that the king only
had right to the earldom of Marr, lord&s;hip of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This reduction was confirmed in parlia|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
5th November 1457.</P>
<P>But again&s;t all the&s;e proceedings, Thomas
lord Erskine, entered his prote&s;t; and he
and his po&s;terity always continued to a&s;|&s;ert
their right to the earldom of Marr, and
to complain of the violence with which they
&s;aid it was wre&s;ted from them.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in the reign of queen Mary,
John, then lord Erskine, obtained leave to
have this que&s;tion tried a-new, and to have
it determined by an inque&s;t, whether he was
neare&s;t heir to I&s;abel counte&s;s of Marr or not.
And lord Erskine having laid before the in|que&s;t
the proofs of his propinquity, as above
deduced, and &s;hown, that there was nothing
in the four rea&s;ons of reduction, at the in|&s;tance
of the king, 1457;</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e it never was before heard of,
or pretended, that the proof of propinquity
to one's ance&s;tors, by undoubted records, was
<PB N="468" REF="489">
not as valid as that by witne&s;&s;es, which in
many ca&s;es, by lap&s;e of time, was rendered
impo&s;&s;ible. That if this was to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
as a rule, the king would be found to have
right to one half of the lands of Scotland, as
well as to the earldom of Marr.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> rea&s;on, the act of
parliament anent the king's keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
during his minority; that could be no rea|&s;on
for reducing the &s;ervice of Robert lord
Erskine to I&s;abel counte&s;s of Marr, but only
for not giving him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the king's
majority.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>third</HI> rea&s;on, that I&s;abel
counte&s;s of Marr did not die la&s;t ve&s;ted and
&s;ai&s;ed, but earl Alexander her husband, and
Thomas his natural &s;on; it was of no weight,
becau&s;e that Alexander was only &s;ai&s;ed of
that e&s;tate in right of liferent, failing i&s;&s;ue of
the marriage, as appeared by the charter of
the &s;aid counte&s;s I&s;abel, and earl Alexander,
dated 9th December 1404.</P>
<P>And which is confirmed by king Robert's
charter of confirmation, 21&s;t January 1404-5,
by which it undeniably appears, that the
charter of re&s;ignation by I&s;abel counte&s;s of
Marr, 12th Augu&s;t 1404, was altered both
by the parties concerned, and their &s;overeign
lord the king; and therefore the re&s;ignation
and charter that followed thereon, 28th May
1426, in favours of the &s;aid Alexander, and
Thomas his natural &s;on (who died before him
without i&s;&s;ue) was null and void.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>fourth</HI> rea&s;on, that I&s;abel of
Marr, queen to Robert Bruce, was daughter
to Gratney earl of Marr, and elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to
Elyne, who married &s;ir John Menteith; that
it was well known, that I&s;abel of Marr, queen
to Robert Bruce, was &s;i&s;ter to Gratney earl
of Marr&punc; and not his daughter, but daughter
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">|earl of Marr, his father, which
was fully proved by Gratney earl of Marr
being always &s;tiled, in king Robert's charters,
his brother, but never his father.</P>
<P>The inque&s;t accordingly met, and found
by their retour, dated 5th May 1555, that
he was the neare&s;t heir to Robert earl of Marr
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, lord Erskine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Ro|bert
was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> heir to I&s;abel counte&s;s of

Scotland included in their treaty with the

one of the guarantees of a treaty with the En|gli&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a charter 15th May 1525, con|&s;tituting
John lord Erskine, and his heirs,
captain and con&s;table of the ca&s;tle of Stirling,
together with the keeping of his maje&s;ty's

as he or any of his ance&s;tors had done
heretofore.</P>
<P>In the year 1534, he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador
to the court of England, to negotiate &s;ome
matters of the highe&s;t importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 540.</NOTE> and con|cluded

when he went to marry prince&s;s Magdalene
de Valois, daughter of Francis I. <HI>anno</HI> 1537.</P>
<P>After the death of James V. 1542, the
keeping of his in&s;ant &s;overeign was commit|ted
<PB N="462" REF="491">
to him. Indeed the care and keeping of
the king's children had been &s;o often given
to this family, that they now claimed it as
their privilege, and actually enjoyed the
&s;ame, till &s;uch time as king James VI. &s;uc|ceeded
to the crown of England. He di&s;|charged
his duty in that high and difficult tru&s;t
of the guardian&s;hip of his young &s;overeign
with the greate&s;t fidelity and prudence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All our hi&s;to|rians.</NOTE> and
though this noble lord was one of tho&s;e that
inclined to the reformation, then beginning in
Scotland, yet he always &s;teadily and vigorou&s;|ly
oppo&s;ed the practices of the court of Eng|land,
which he thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the
honour and independency of his country, and
&s;howed him&s;elf equally incapable of being
moved by Engli&s;h gold, or the threatenings
of a party. Queen Mary remained in his
keeping till the year 1548, when the e&s;tates
of the kingdom, to avoid the practices of the
court of England, and of the faction in Scot|land
that had joined with them, thought pro|per
to order him to carry the queen to the
court of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> there to be educated under
the eye and care of Francis I. which he ac|cordingly
did, and delivered her &s;afe into the
hands of that monarch, and immediately re|turned
home.</P>

honour and integrity; and although
he was concerned in every tran&s;action of im|portance
in this country, from his father's
death till his own, yet he conducted him&s;elf
&s;o in tho&s;e factious unquiet times, that he is
allowed by the hi&s;torians of both &s;ides to have
been a &s;teady friend to his country, and a
man of as un&s;potted a character as any per&s;on
then upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Being born a younger brother, he was e|ducated
for the church, and was, when very
young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> by king James V. appointed commen|dator
of Cambuskenneth, and Inchmahomo in

<P>Immediately after his father's death, he
was appointed governor of the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In archiv. fa|miliae de Marr.</NOTE>
which, to the &s;atisfaction of the nati|on,
he nobly kept again&s;t all foreigners, both
French and Engli&s;h. Immediately upon queen
Mary's return from France, <HI>anno</HI> 1561, he
was nominated one of her privy council, and
got from her &s;everal grants of church lands,
at that time newly di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>He then likeways, as has been beforemen|tioned,
renewed his claim to the earldom of
Marr, and obtained liberty to have that cau&s;e
re-heard; and his right being clearly and di|&s;tinctly
proven, he was re&s;tored, <HI>per modum
ju&s;titiae,</HI> to the earldom of Mair, lord&s;hip of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1562. The &s;ame was af|terwards

his &s;eat accordingly as earl of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rolls of par|liament.</NOTE> and he

that they ought to be called as the fir&s;t earl.</P>

king Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In archiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Marr.</NOTE> to John earl of Marr, 18th Ju|ly
1566, narrating, that the family of Erskine
of long and bygone times had the cu&s;tody and
<PB N="463" REF="492">
keeping of the principal forts and places of
&s;trength in the kingdom, and had always di&s;|charged
their tru&s;t faithfully and &s;toutly;
and their maje&s;ties being de&s;irous to keep no|ble,
antient, and untainted families in their
native lands, rights, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to
make them &s;ecure of the &s;ame; and particu|larly
con&s;idering, that John earl of Marr,
and his predece&s;&s;ors, had, for a long time by|gone,
been keepers of the ca&s;tle of Stirling,
and &s;heriffs of the &s;hire thereof; therefore
they gave and granted, heretably and irre|deemably,
to the &s;aid earl of Marr, and his
heirs, bearing the arms and &s;irname of Er|skine,
the office of &s;heriff of Stirling-&s;hire, or
the prefecture or captain&s;hip, and cu&s;tody of
the ca&s;tle of Stirling, with the park, garden,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> together with the office of bailiary
and chamberlainry of the lands and lord&s;hip of
Stirling, and of the water of Forth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1566, how &s;oon king James
VI. was born, the care and keeping of him
was committed to the earl of Marr, which
great tru&s;t he faithfully di&s;charged, and with
great prudence and firmne&s;s, took all imagin|able
care of his royal education, and to pro|tect
his &s;acred per&s;on from the violence and
&s;nares of the two contending parties, who left
no means what&s;oever untried of getting him
into their hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's me|moirs, and all our hi&s;to|rians.</NOTE> For this rea&s;on he remov|ed
the king from Edinburgh to Stirling,
where he was governor, and had the &s;ole
command. Although he always behaved with
the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the queen, and had
the greate&s;t regard for her maje&s;ty, yet the
unhappy &s;ituation of his country at that time
forced him to concur with tho&s;e who &s;et the
crown on the prince's head, <HI>anno</HI> 1567. And
as he appears not to have been &s;atisfied with
the intentions of either of the parties, nor
with their method of pur&s;uing them, he de|clined
being engaged on either &s;ide, further
than the pre&s;ervation of the king's per&s;on,
and the liberties of his country made it ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary for him to be. And altho',
when the factions came to blows, he general|ly
joined and &s;upported the party that called
them&s;elves the king's, yet as he plainly &s;how|ed
that he thought them too much guided
and influenced by the court of England, it is
certain they never let him into any of their
&s;ecrets.</P>
<P>When the earl of Lennox, the regent,
was &s;urprized, and killed in the town of Stir|ling,
he, by the timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance he brought
to the king's party, prevented the whole heads
of it from being cut off or made pri&s;oners:
and when a new regent was to be cho&s;en, the
confidence that the nation in general had in
the earl of Marr's integrity and moderation,
forced the king's party to con&s;ent to his be|ing
made regent, notwith&s;tanding all the
practices u&s;ed by queen Elizabeth and her
amba&s;&s;adors to prevent it.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
high office, he applied him&s;elf vigorou&s;ly to
allay, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the factions which tore
his country in pieces, and to free it from the
influence of Engli&s;h councils. In order to
the&s;e things he had accomodated matters with
Kirkcaldie of Grange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and others who were
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and
per&s;uaded them to join and co-operate with
him, to bring about peace and tranquillity,
thing &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for: but ju&s;t
when he was on the point of bringing the&s;e
good purpo&s;es to bear, he, to the great mi&s;|fortune
of his country, died a young man, in
November 1572; as &s;ome &s;ay, not without
the &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on.</P>
<P>He married Annabella Murray, daughter of
lord Tullibardine, by whom he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> his heir,&mdash;and a daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Archibald earl
of Angus.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN, fourteenth lord Erskine, and
&s;eventh earl of Marr, who was very young at
the time of his father's death, and was edu|cated
in the ca&s;tle of Stirling, along with
king James VI. whom the &s;tates of the king|dom,
after the death of lord Marr, commit|ted
to the care of his widow the counte&s;s of
Marr; and though this earl had been edu|cated
with king James, yet he, in his young|er
days, was &s;o far &s;educed by &s;ome others of
the nobility, as to forget him&s;elf, and the un|blemi&s;hed
loyalty of his ance&s;tors, and to join
with them in &s;urprizing the king at Ruth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">en,
<HI>anno</HI> 1582, for which his whole lands were
ju&s;tly &s;eized, and he obliged to fly the coun|try:
however, he &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of the
crime he had committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a|mil. de Marr.</NOTE> and the king was &s;o
gracious as to pardon him, re&s;tore to him his
whole e&s;tate, and receive him again into his
favour.</P>
<P>In the year 1595, the king intru&s;ted the
keeping of his new born &s;on and heir, as u&s;u|al,
to the earl of Marr, with a &s;trict order
to him not to deliver him up to any per&s;on
whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> without a written mandate under
his own hand; and, in ca&s;e of his death, not
to deliver him to any per&s;on what&s;omever,
neither to the queen his mother, nor even to
the parliament, if they required it, till he was
eighteen years of age, then he would com|mand
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Marr was naturally a man of great
abilities, and being bred from his infancy in
<PB N="464" REF="493">
the factious court of king James VI. he be|came
an able &s;tate&s;man. He was the per&s;on
the king cho&s;e to &s;end to England, to con|gratulate
queen Elizabeth upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;i|on
of the attempt of the earl of E&s;&s;ex.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil, &amp; all our hi&s;torians.</NOTE> And
it is acknowledged, he entered into &s;ome &s;e|cret
negotiations and mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring
the king's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England.
He was accompanied by the abbot of Kinlo&s;s,
and matters were managed with &s;uch dexteri|ty
and addre&s;s, that mo&s;t of the queen's mi|ni&s;ters
and great men of England, entered in|to
engagements, unknown to her maje&s;ty, and
to one another, to &s;upport king James's title
to the crown of England.</P>
<P>When king James went to England, <HI>anno</HI>
1603, he carried lord Marr along with him;
but before he came to York, lord Marr was
obliged to return to Scotland to appea&s;e queen
Anne, who had demanded her daughter prin|ce&s;s
Elizabeth, and her &s;on prince Charles,
whom lord Marr had left under the care of
his counte&s;s, with expre&s;s command, not to
deliver them to any per&s;on whatever, with|out
an order under his hand. It is &s;aid, that
the queen never forgave him this,</P>
<P>However, immediately thereafter he fol|lowed
the king to England, and &s;o &s;oon as he
got to London he was appointed a privy coun|cillor
of that kingdom, and was en&s;talled one
of the knights of the garter at Wind&s;or 1603.</P>
<P>He continued much at court, and greatly
in the king's favour, for the fir&s;t eight or ten
years after he went to England, who entru&s;t|ed
and confided much in him with regard to
the management of foreign affairs, and he was
&s;aid to be at the head of the French &s;action,
as it was then called.</P>
<P>On the 3d of February 1620, he obtained
a charter, upon his own re&s;ignation, of the
earldom of Marr, lord&s;hip of Strathdon, and
Strathdee, of Garrioch, and Alloa, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> toge|ther
with the heretable offices of captain&s;hip
of the ca&s;tle of Stirling, and &s;heriff of the
&s;hire thereof, chamberlainry of the lord&s;hip of
Stirling, Menteith, Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">chin, and Navarre,
bailiary and admiralty of the water of Forth,
to him and his heirs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv is fam. de Marr, et in pub. archi|vis.</NOTE> This charter has a <HI>de

and free earldom of Marr, and declares infeft|ment,
taken at the tower or ca&s;tle of Alloa,
&s;hall be &s;ufficient for the whole.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Henry prince of
Wales, who&s;e education he had had the care
of, he left the court, and returned to Scot|land,
where he was made lord high trea&s;urer,
in which office he continued till the 1631,
that he re&s;igned it, and retired to the coun|try
from all public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It does not appear that he received from
his royal ma&s;ter any gratuities in England,
but he was mo&s;t bountiful to him in his
grants of lands in Scotland; by which, and
his paternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he became po&s;&s;e&s;t of
one of the greate&s;t e&s;tates of any per&s;on in
this kingdom.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, Anne, daughter of David
lord Drummond, by whom he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Mary Stewart,
daughter of E&s;me, and &s;i&s;ter of Ludovick
duke of Lennox, by whom he had &s;even &s;ons
and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Buchan.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Henry,</HI> lord Cardro&s;s, ance&s;tor of the
pre&s;ent earl of Buchan, (<HI>vide</HI> p. 97th of this

the peerage of Cardro&s;s, with power to a&s;|&s;ign
it to any of his &s;ons he thought proper,
he accordingly di&s;poned it to his &s;on Henry,
who, in con&s;equence thereof, &s;at as lord Car|dro&s;s
in the parliament of Scotland even dur|ing
his father's life.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>Alexander Erskine,</HI> one of the &s;e|nators

<P>John earl of Marr died in an advanced
age in the year 1634, and was &s;ucceeded by
his &s;on,</P>
<P>XV. JOHN, fifteenth lord Erskine, and
eighth earl of Marr, who was a man of learn|ing,
and a great projector, whereby he &s;pent
a con&s;iderable part of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>He was made one of the knights of the
bath, at the coronation of Henry prince of
Wales, <HI>anno</HI> 1610.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="494">
He was appointed one of his maje&s;ty's pri|vy
council in Scotland, one of the &s;enators of
the college of ju&s;tice, and governor of the
ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, <HI>anno</HI> 1615.</P>
<P>He continued a lord of &s;e&s;&s;ion till the year

<P>He was removed from being governor of
the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh <HI>anno</HI> 1638, and ge|neral

<P>In the &s;ame year, king Charles having
formed the de&s;ign of purcha&s;ing all the here|table

to enter into a minute with him, obliging
him&s;elf to &s;ell to his maje&s;ty the heretable
&s;heriff-&s;hip of Stirling-&s;hire, and the bailiary
of the water of Forth, for the &s;um of eight
thou&s;and pound &s;terling; dated at Whitehall,

1641, and of the &s;ame date, gets a bond for
the eight thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t breaking out of the great
rebellion in king Charles the I.'s time, he
appears to have inclined to join with the co|venanters,
and was by them appointed a privy
councillor for life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;cinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1641; but &s;o &s;oon as
he di&s;covered their true intention, he openly

continued to act &s;teadily with them as long
as he lived; and on that account, he had
his e&s;tate &s;eque&s;trated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me|moirs.</NOTE> and &s;uffered many other

<P>He &s;old many of his lands in Scotland, and

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1654, and was &s;ucceeded by

ninth earl of Marr, who, in his father's life|time,
got charters under the great &s;eal, <HI>Jo|hanni

&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> This is in&s;tructed by &s;everal char|ters
in the public regi&s;ter, between the years
1640 and 1642</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and merit,
and invariably attached to the intere&s;t of his
king and country.</P>
<P>He was much courted by the covenanters
and their party, to accept of a command in
their army: But, upon his ab&s;olute refu&s;al to
have any connection with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me|moirs, p. 60. and 70.</NOTE> the command
de&s;igned for him in their army, together with
the Stirling-&s;hire regiment, was given to lord
Living&s;ton.</P>
<P>He having joined with the marquis of
Montro&s;e, the parliament ordered his hou&s;es
of Erskine and Alloa to be plundered.</P>
<P>After the battle of Kil&s;yth, he adverti&s;ed
the marquis of Montro&s;e of general Le&s;ly's
advancing again&s;t him, and warned him of
the danger he was in.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's memoirs.</NOTE> But this could not
prevent the fatal battle of Philiphaugh, from
whence he, (then only lord Erskine) with
great difficulty, made his e&s;cape to his father's

friends and va&s;&s;als of his family for his ma|je&s;ty's

<P>XVII. CHARLES, &s;eventeenth lord Er|skine,
and tenth earl of Marr, who, tho' he
died a young man, yet, he &s;howed him&s;elf,
while he lived, worthy of his ance&s;tors, and
&s;trongly attached to the intere&s;t of his country.</P>
<P>King Charles the II. appointed him one of
the lords of his privy council, <HI>anno</HI> 1682.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, he rai&s;ed a regiment
of foot upon his own expences for his maje|&s;ty's
&s;ervice, which has &s;ince been known by
<PB N="466" REF="495">
the name of the Scotch Fuzileers; and he
continued colonel of this regiment till he died.</P>
<P>The great debts his grandfather and father
had been obliged to contract, during the time
of the grand rebellion, obliged him to &s;ell a
great part of his e&s;tate; and, among other
lands, the lord&s;hip of Erskine, which had
never before been out of the family, and
which is now po&s;&s;e&s;t by the lord Blantyre.</P>
<P>Although he was one of king James VII.'s
privy councillors, yet he was far from approving
of the mea&s;ures followed in the latter end of
that reign, and had actually left his hou&s;e in
order to retire and live privately abroad,
when the news of king William's landing
came to Scotland.</P>
<P>He joined the convention of e&s;tates, and
rai&s;ed a large body of his va&s;&s;als and follow|ers
in &s;upport thereof; but dyed very &s;oon
thereafter.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Maule, daughter of
George earl of Panmure, by whom he had
eight &s;ons, and one daughter. Two of his
&s;ons were named Charles, two of them George,
and one by the name of Francis, who all died
young.</P>
<P>The &s;urviving &s;ons were,</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Erskine</HI> of Grange, a man of ex|traordinary
abilities, who, being bred to the
law, became &s;o eminent in that profe&s;&s;ion,
when very young, that he was by her maje|&s;ty
queen Anne, appointed one of the &s;e|nators
of the college of ju&s;tice, <HI>anno</HI> 1706,
and thereafter lord ju&s;tice-clerk; in which
offices he had many opportunities of di&s;play|ing
the great talents he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>3. Colonel <HI>Henry Erskine,</HI> a young man
of a great military genius, who was unfortu|nately
killed at the battle of Almanza in Spain,
<HI>anno</HI> 1707.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to &s;ir
Hugh Pater&s;on of Bannockburn, and had i&s;|&s;ue.</P>
<P>He died in the &s;lower of his age, in 1689,
and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>XVIII. JOHN, eighteenth lord Erskine,
and eleventh earl of Marr, who was a man of
the mo&s;t &s;hining parts, and greate&s;t capacity,
of mo&s;t men in the age he lived in.</P>
<P>He was very young when his father died,
and, upon his becoming of age, was appointed
one of the lords of the privy council in Scot|land,
had the command of a regiment of foot,
and was made knight of the mo&s;t noble order
of St. Andrew.</P>
<P>In the year 1705, he was made one of the
principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate for Scotland, and,
the year following, was appointed one of the
commi&s;&s;ioners for the treaty of union betwixt
the two nations. He joined and concurred
heartily with others of the Scotch nobility,
who at la&s;t brought that great affair to a con|clu&s;ion,
notwith&s;tanding the great oppo&s;ition
it met with from &s;everal other Scotch lords,
who&s;e &s;pirited prote&s;ts are &s;till pre&s;erved in the
records of that parliament.</P>
<P>He was elected one of the &s;ixteen peers
for Scotland, to the four fir&s;t Briti&s;h parlia|ments,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the years 1707, 1708, 1710,
and 1713.</P>
<P>In the year 1708, he was appointed one
of the lords of the privy council, and was al|ways
in the greate&s;t favour with his royal
mi&s;tre&s;s queen Anne, who was thought to
confide in him more than in mo&s;t men, with
regard to her mo&s;t &s;ecret councils and affairs
of &s;tate.</P>
<P>And in the year 1712, &s;he again appoint|ed
him one of the principal &s;ecretaries of
&s;tate.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king George the I. he
was deprived of all his offices, and, in the year
1715, he retired to his e&s;tate in the North
of Scotland, where he, unhappily for his coun|try
and him&s;elf, rai&s;ed a rebellion, and pro|claimed
the pretender at Kirkmichael in
Perth-&s;hire, on the 11th of September that
year; and being joined by &s;everal of the di&s;|affected
nobility and gentry, he got together
about 6 or 7000 men, mo&s;t of them unarm|ed,
and all undi&s;ciplined, who rende&s;vouzed
at Perth about the beginning of November,
from whence they marched to Sheriff-muir,
near Dumblane, where, on the 13th of that
month, being met by the king's army, com|manded
by John duke of Argyle, inferior in
numbers, but &s;uperior in regularity and di&s;|cipline,
a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued, in which
a good deal of blood was &s;hed on both &s;ides.
The earl of Marr behaved like a brave officer,
having his hor&s;e &s;hot under him, and &s;howing
every token of &s;pirit and gallantry, but neither
of the generals could claim the victory, the
duke retiring to Stirling, and the earl to Perth:
however, it had all the effect of a victory to
the government, for the earl of Marr was
never, after his retreat to Perth, able again
to bring the rebels forces together, but was
obliged to make his e&s;cape beyond &s;eas, and
in the year 1716, was attainted of high trea|&s;on,
along with the duke of Ormond and lord
Bolingbroke, and their honours and e&s;tates
were forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>This unhappy lord, after his going abroad,
followed the pretender to Rome, and remain|ed
in his &s;ervice till the year 1721. He
then went to Paris, and continued there
till 1729; when, on the account of his bad
<PB N="467" REF="496">
&s;tate of health, he was obliged to go to Aix la
Chapelle, where he continued till his death,
Which happened in May 1732.</P>
<P>His e&s;tate was &s;old by the commi&s;&s;ioners of
enquiry into the forfeited e&s;tates, and bought
by the earl's brother, the &s;aid Mr. Erskine of
Grange, for the benefit of his nephew lord Er|skine,
to whom Mr. Erskine conveyed the
&s;ame, <HI>anno</HI> 1739.</P>
<P>This earl married, 1&s;t, lady Margaret Hay,
daughter of Thomas earl of Kinnoul, by whom
he had two &s;ons,</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> who died an infant.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Thomas,</HI> now lord Erskine.</P>
<P>He married 2dly, lady Frances Pierpont,
daughter of Evelyn duke of King&s;ton, in
England, by whom he had one daughter,</P>

George the I. was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;ettle,
out of her father's e&s;tate, the &s;ame fortune &s;he
was intitled to by her mother's marriage-&s;et|tlement.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty was likewi&s;e plea&s;ed to give
the counte&s;s of Marr, from the time of her
husband's attainder, the &s;ame jointure &s;he was
intitled to by her marriage-&s;ettlements in ca&s;e
of his death.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Frances Erskine,</HI> married her cou&s;in
James Erskine, &s;on of her uncle Mr. Erskine

<P>I. JOHN, &s;econd &s;on of James third earl
of Perth, being a man of great parts, both
natural and acquired, made a con&s;iderable fi|gure
in his time, and married, 1&s;t, Sophia,
&s;ole heire&s;s and repre&s;entative of the mo&s;t an|tient
family of Lundin of that ilk, in the
county of Fife, who&s;e i&s;&s;ue by her will be
mentioned under the title of Drummond earl
of Perth.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Eupheme, daughter of
&s;ir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, baronet,
lord ju&s;tice-clerk. To the i&s;&s;ue of this mar|riage
only was the peerage granted, and they
were the only &s;ufferers by the attainder.</P>
<P>Mr. Drummond was in great favour with
king Charles II. who, in 1680, made him
general of the ordnance, and deputy gover|nor
of Edinburgh ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In 1682, when the duke of Queensberry
was appointed lord high trea&s;urer of Scot|land,
Mr. Drummond was made trea&s;urer de|pute.</P>

<P>NO &s;irname in Scotland claims a higher

<P>The traditional account thereof, handed
down to us by our hi&s;torians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Aber|crombie, p. 549, v. I. &amp;c.</NOTE> is, that they
are de&s;cended of the renowned Graeme, who,
in the year 404, was general of king Fergus
II's. army, and was governor of Scotland in
the minority of his grandchild king Eugene
II. fought with the Romans, defeated the Bri|tons,
and in the 420, made a breach in,
and forced that mighty wall which the em|peror
Severus had reared up between the
rivers Forth and Clyde, as the utmo&s;t limits
of the Roman empire, to keep out the Scots
from mole&s;ting them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions;
which wall has ever &s;ince retained, and to
this day goes under the name of Graeme's
Dyke.</P>
<P>The foundation of this great rampart has
been of late traced from the one river to the
other, and is fully in&s;tructed by &s;everal &s;tones
found therein, which have Roman in&s;cripti|ons
cut out upon them, denoting the limits
where, and by whom they were &s;et, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A

be &s;een in the college of Gla&s;gow, and are
well de&s;cribed in Mr. Gordon's <HI>Itinerarium

<P>This great man is &s;aid to have married a
lady of the royal hou&s;e of Denmark, and was
progenitor of all the Grahams in the kingdom
of Scotland.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, however, in&s;i&s;t no further on

by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XX. JAMES, fifth earl of Montro&s;e, born
in 1612, who&s;e education was &s;uitable to his
high birth. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many emi|nent
qualities, with an uncommon military
genius, which he nobly exerted in the &s;ervice
of his king and country.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he was at fir&s;t engaged on the covenanters
&s;ide; but no &s;ooner did he perceive their in|tentions,
and the mea&s;ures they were pur&s;uing,
than he de&s;erted their party, went over to the
king's &s;ervice, was created marquis of Mon|tro&s;e
on 16th May 1644, and continued &s;tea|dy
and unalterable in the intere&s;t of the royal
family to the end of his life.</P>
<P>The many great actions he performed, and
the glorious victories he obtained with hand|fuls
of loyali&s;ts again&s;t the numerous forces of
their enemies, <HI>viz.</HI> at Tippermuir, Alfurd, A|berdeen,
Inverlochy, Kil&s;yth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will &s;carce
be believed by after-ages; and as they are all
narrated in the life of that great man, written
by doctor Wi&s;hart, who was an eye-witne&s;s,
to that we mu&s;t refer our readers, as it is in|con&s;i&s;tent
with the brevity of this work to be
more particular.</P>
<P>However, we mu&s;t here, for the &s;ake of
truth, vindicate him of one a&s;per&s;ion which
hath been mo&s;t unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon him by
&s;ome authors, who have alledged, that he ac|tually
took the &s;olemn league and covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
con&s;equently was guilty of the breach of that
oath: but this is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; for in Oc|tober
1643, he was &s;ummoned to appear be|fore
the parliament to take that &s;olemn league,
betwixt and the beginning of January then
next: but at that time he was with the king,
&s;o did not appear.</P>
<P>Upon the 12th of January 1644, there
was a decreet of parliament pronounced again&s;t
him for not complying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> upon which he was
outlawed, forfeited, and his e&s;tate ordered to
be &s;eque&s;trate.</P>
<P>He was afterwards intercommuned under
the de&s;ignation of James Graham, &s;ometime
<PB N="485" REF="516">
earl of montro&s;e, for being in rebellion a|gain&s;t

<P>He was at la&s;t taken pri&s;oner, him&s;elf

<P>I. DAVID LESLY, fifth &s;on of Patrick fir&s;t
lord Lindores, being a younger brother,
and having a genius for arms, went abroad to
pu&s;h his fortune in the foreign wars, got into
the &s;ervice of the king of Sweden in Germa|ny,
and having remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
upon &s;everal occa&s;ions for his military skill
and capacity, &s;oon ro&s;e to the rank of a colo|nel
of hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he returned to Scotland, entered into the &s;er|vice
of the parliament, was appointed lieute|nant-general
of the forces they &s;ent to Eng|land,
to the parliament's a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the
king.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle of Nasby, he
made a quick march with a con&s;iderable bo|dy
of hor&s;e to Scotland, &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated
the great Montro&s;e at Philiphaugh, <HI>anno</HI>
1645, and, for his good and faithful &s;ervices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE>
got a gift from the parliament of fifty thou|&s;and
merks, to be paid out of the fine impo&s;|ed
upon the marquis of Douglas for being on
the king's &s;ide, 18th March 1646.</P>
<P>He was declared lieutenant-general of all
the forces in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;cinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> had a pen&s;ion of one
thou&s;and pounds <HI>per</HI> month &s;ettled on him,
29th February 1647, and that be&s;ides his pay
as colonel of the Perth-&s;hire hor&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Scots determined to rai&s;e an ar|my
to re&s;cue the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;cinded acts, and mi|nutes of parlt.</NOTE> Mr. Le&s;ly was made
general of the hor&s;e, by a commi&s;&s;ion dated
11th May 1648; and from this time fore|ward,
he appears to have been a loyal &s;ubject;
however, he was then laid a&s;ide, and general
Middleton obtained the chief command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> by
a commi&s;&s;ion dated 19th June, that &s;ame year.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king (which hor|rible
&s;cene general Le&s;ly had in the utmo&s;t
dete&s;tation) none appeared more de&s;irous of
a re&s;toration of the royal family than the ge|neral.</P>
<P>When the Scots declared for king Charles
II. and began to rai&s;e forces for his &s;ervice,
in 1650, general Le&s;ly was appointed one of
their chief commanders, and &s;oon got into
great favour with his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And though he was defeated at Dunbar by
Oliver Cromwell, yet it is acknowledged he
acted the part of a brave and able officer.</P>
<P>After the king was crowned at Scoon, in
January 1651, there was a new army levied,
which the king commanded in per&s;on, and
Mr. Le&s;ly was appoined major-general. But at
the unfortunate battle of Worce&s;ter he was
taken pri&s;oner, and committed to the tower
of London, where he continued confined till
the re&s;toration of king Charles II. in May
1660.</P>
<P>The king, in reward of his faithful &s;er|vices,
and great &s;ufferings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in pub. archiv. haered. ma&s;c. ex ejus corp.</NOTE> was plea&s;ed to
rai&s;e him to the dignity of the peerage, by
the title of baron of Newark, in the county

dated 31&s;t Augu&s;t 1660, and &s;ettled on
him a pen&s;ion of five hundred pounds <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Newark at that time had &s;ome ene|mies
at court, who endeavoured to inpre&s;s the
king with bad notions of his &s;incerity and in|tegrity;
but the king, being convinced of
his hone&s;ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original let|ter, pen. dom. Newark.</NOTE> wrote a letter to him with his
own hand, which is &s;till pre&s;erved in the fa|mily;
wherein his maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ures him, that
he is perfectly &s;atisfied of his honour and loy|alty;
that it is not in the power of the ma|lice

him; that if he had occa&s;ion to levy an army
for his own &s;ervice, he would not fail to give

<HEAD>MAXWELL Earl of NITHSDALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;irname of Maxwell is mentioned
in our olde&s;t records, as &s;oon as &s;irnames
began to be frequently u&s;ed in Scotland.</P>
<P>Their immediate ance&s;tor, Machus, or Ma|cus,
lived in the reign of king Malcolm Can|more,
appears to have been a man of rank,
and had con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the county
of Roxburgh, which were afterwards called
the barony and pari&s;h of Macu&s;well, and from
thence the &s;irname of the family.</P>
<P>A learned and judicious antiquary &s;ays, he
has often met with the name of Machus in
antient writs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrymple.</NOTE> and that it appears to be Saxon.</P>
<P>He &s;ays al&s;o, that Herbert, the donor of the
church of Macu&s;well to the mona&s;tery of
Kel&s;o, in the reign of king Malcolm IV. was
de&s;cended of the &s;aid Machus.</P>
<P>From him therefore we proceed to deduce
the de&s;cent of this mo&s;t noble family.</P>
<P>I. MACHUS, proprietor of the lands and
barony of Macu&s;well, near Kel&s;o inRoxburgh|&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE>

<P>2. <HI>Edmund,</HI> who both a&s;&s;umed their &s;ir|name
from their father's lands and barony of
Macu&s;well, as was the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e early
times, which in proce&s;s of time came to be
called Maxwell.</P>
<P>The&s;e brothers lived in the reign of king
David I. who &s;ucceeded to the crown of
Scotland, <HI>onno</HI> 1124, and died <HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>

<P>II. HUGO de MACUSWELL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle.</NOTE> together with
Herbert the chancellor, are witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>OLIPHANT Lord OLIPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>THO' few families have made a greater fi|gure
in the annals of Scotland, than
that of Oliphant, yet the traditional accounts
of their origin are various. Some alledge,
that when Harold king of Norway invaded
Scotland with a powerful fleet and army, in
the reign of king Donald VI. a noble Nor|wegian,
called &s;ir Donald Oliphard, was taken
pri&s;oner by the king of Scots, and being a
man of rank and di&s;tinction, was treated ac|cording
to his quality and merit. A peace
being afterwards concluded betwixt the two
crowns, &s;ir Donald had liberty to return home;
but being plea&s;ed with the entertainment he
met with, and having contracted a friend&s;hip
with &s;everal of the fir&s;t quality, he married
and &s;ettled in this country, and he is &s;aid to
have been progenitor of all the Oliphants in
Scotland.</P>
<P>However, we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer on tra|ditional
accounts, but proceed to deduce the
de&s;cent of this mo&s;t ancient and noble fami|ly,
by unque&s;tionable documents from,</P>
<P>I. DAVID de HOLIFARD or OLIFARD,
a man of rank and figure in Scotland, in the
reign of king Alexander I. He appears to have
been much about the court of king David,
who, upon the death of king Alexander, &s;uc|ceeded
to the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1124.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch barons, who ac|companied
that prince to England, when he
went with an army to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Maud
the empre&s;s, his niece, again&s;t king Stephen,
but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrvmple's collections, p. 174.</NOTE> upon the rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of Wince|&s;ter,
king David was &s;o hotly pur&s;ued by the
Engli&s;h army, that had it not been for the va|lour
and courage of this David de Oliphard,
he had been taken pri&s;oner, <HI>anno</HI> 1142.</P>
<P>King David, in reward of this noble action,
is &s;aid to have made him a grant of &s;everal
lands, both in the Lothians and in Perth-&s;hire,
but we do not find them &s;o early mentioned
in our records.</P>
<P>In king David I.'s grants to the priory of
Coldingham, David de Olifard is a witne&s;s, and
his &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Coldingham, Nisbet, vol. I. p. 244.</NOTE> being three cre&s;cents, is thereto ap|pended,
which is the armorial bearing of the
Oliphants to this day, a convincing proof that
this David was progenitor of this noble fami|ly.</P>
<P>In the reign of the &s;ame king David, there
happened a di&s;pute betwixt Robert bi&s;hop of
St. Andrews, and G. abbot of Dunfermline:
It was &s;ubmitted to king David and his &s;on
prince Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concordia fact, &amp;c. Chartulary of Dunfermline.</NOTE> and was by them accorded to
the &s;atisfaction of both parties, to which Da|vid
de Olifard, and Herbert, great chamber|lain
of Scotland, were witne&s;&s;es. This deed
is without date, but Herbert was chamberlain
from 1122 to 1144, in which &s;pace that a|greement
mu&s;t have been concluded.</P>

with the clergy, having been appointed bailie
of Barry by the abbot of Cupar in 1511, a
juri&s;diction of con&s;iderable weight before the
reformation, and only be&s;towed on tho&s;e who
were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">irm friends of the church.</P>
<P>He attended king James to the battle of

who was one of tho&s;e loyal barons that
endeavoured to re&s;cue king James V. from

was kept little better than a captive, and
with that view, joined the earl of Lennox at
the fight near Linlithgow bridge, <HI>anno</HI> 1526;

came of age, retained &s;o la&s;ting a &s;en&s;e, that

<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, he no &s;ooner &s;aw
his country threatened with danger by party

he rai&s;ed his va&s;&s;als and followers, and with
lord Gray, attacked lord Ruthven in Perth,
and held out that town again&s;t the queen's

compromi&s;ed.</P>
<P>He &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the match between
queen Mary and prince Edward of England,
from an apprehen&s;ion that his country might

was a mighty favourite of king James

maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, when he went to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Engli&s;h throne, <HI>anno</HI> 1603, and
was made one of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber.
The king, being perfectly &s;en&s;ible
of his great capacity and fine accompli&s;hments,
had him always in great e&s;teem.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1610, he got a new charter of his
antient barony of Panmure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> al&s;o charters of
a great many other baronies.</P>
<P>In the reign of king Charles I. with his

of Arbroath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which had been erected into a
temporal lord&s;hip, <HI>anno</HI> 1608, whereby he
became proprietor of a greater number of pa|tronages
than were po&s;&s;e&s;t by any other &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>And the king's regard for him &s;till increa&s;|ing,
he recommended him, in the &s;tronge&s;t
manner, to his &s;on prince Charles, as one he
might entirely rely on for honour and fideli|ty,
of which king Charles, in his trouble|&s;ome
reign, had many convincing proofs.</P>
<P>He was continued in the bed-chamber,
and made keeper of his maje&s;ty's hou&s;e and
park at Eltham in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chivis Car. I.</NOTE> and &s;heriff prin|cipal

of a great many other lands and baronies.</P>
<P>During the civil wars he attended the king
in all his battles, and never de&s;erted him on
any occa&s;ion what&s;omever. The king, in re|gard
and recompence of his con&s;tant loyalty
and faithful &s;ervices, was plea&s;ed, as a la&s;ting

<P>When the king, by order of parliament,
was deprived of all his dome&s;ticks at Holmby,
in Northampton-&s;hire, he only de&s;ired that
two of his old &s;ervants &s;hould be allowed to

was one. He attended him clo&s;e in all
his removes, till at la&s;t he and all his attend|ants
were finally di&s;charged by colonel Ham|mond,
in the i&s;le of Wight, which was a mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible affliction both to his maje&s;ty and the
earl, who immediately repaired to Scotland,
when he could do no more &s;ervice to his roy|al
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>And though he lived quietly at home, be|ing
very aged, yet Cromwell thought fit to
impo&s;e a fine upon him often thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed ordi|nance of Cromwell's council, anno 1654.</NOTE> but it was afterwards mitigated to
four thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which he paid

the &s;ame virtues and loyal principles
with his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>When king Charles II. came to Scotland
in 1650, he immediately waited on his ma|je&s;ty,

and being appointed colonel of the Forfar re|giment
of hor&s;e, many of the principal gentle|men
of the county, out of re&s;pect to his lord|&s;hip,
joined his regiment, and &s;erved under

<P>He fought upon their head at the battles
of Dunbar and Innerkeithing, at the latter of
which he was wounded, his lieutenan-colonel,
his major, and many of his officers, being
killed on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>After the defeat at Worce&s;ter, the loyal|i&s;ts,

them&s;elves under his command; in which
&s;tation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and peerage of Ireland, &amp;c.</NOTE> by frequent skirmi&s;hes and incur&s;ions,

<P>He was &s;worn one of the privy council to

he was &s;oon removed from being a privy
councillor; and tho' he was always a &s;taunch
prote&s;tant, yet at the convention of e&s;tates
in 1689, he vigorou&s;ly appeared for the in|tere&s;t

<P>He likeways oppo&s;ed the union with all

the honour and independency of Scotland.</P>
<P>In 1715 he joined his nephew, John earl
of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodge's peer|age of Ireland vol. II. p. 194, and Scots compend.</NOTE> and behaved mo&s;t he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oically at the

age, and the delicacy of his con&s;titution. He
was taken pri&s;oner in the field, but was in|&s;tantly
re&s;cued by his brother Harry.</P>
<P>He afterwards retired to Paris, and being
attainted of high trea&s;on, his e&s;tate and ho|nours
were forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Hamilton,
daughter of William duke of Hamilton, and
died at Paris without i&s;&s;ue, <HI>anno</HI> 1723.</P>
<P>XX. HARRY MAULE of Kellie, his bro|ther,

been for the earl his brother's attainder.</P>
<P>This Harry was a man of great parts, both
natural and acquired, and had &s;pent much of
his time at the courts of England and France.</P>
<P>He was a member of the convention of e|&s;tates
at the revolution, and followed his bro|ther's
example, when he found they were re|&s;olved
to forfeit king James, and then left

<P>THE family of Drummond has been al|ways
ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t ancient
and illu&s;trious names of the Scotch nation,
highly di&s;tingui&s;hed by a long train of worthy
ance&s;tors, no le&s;s remarkable for the noble al|liances
they made, and the dignities conferred
upon them, than for per&s;onal merit.</P>
<P>They have the honour to be &s;everal times
&s;prung from the royal hou&s;e of Stewart, and
can boa&s;t what few &s;ubjects can do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strathallan, Le&s;ly, Van Ba&s;&s;an, &s;ir G MacKenzie, Hathornden, Bayle, Mar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> That mo&s;t
of the crowned heads in Europe are de&s;cend|ed
from them, as will clearly appear by the
following memoirs.</P>
<P>The traditional account of their origin,
handed down to us by &s;everal good hi&s;tori|ans,
is,</P>
<P>I. That an Hungarian gentleman named
MAURICIUS, or MAURICE, a &s;on of George,
a younger &s;on of Andrew, king of Hungary,
had the command of the &s;hip in which Ed|gar
Atheline, the rightful heir to the Engli&s;h
crown, his mother Agatha, and his &s;i&s;ters, the
prince&s;&s;es Margaret and Chri&s;tian, were em|barked,
in their return from England to Hun|gary.
They were overtaken by a &s;torm,
driven on the coa&s;t of Scotland, and landed
in the frith of Forth, at a place which to this
day retains the name of St. Margaret's Hope,
&s;o called after prince&s;s Margaret, who became
queen to king Malcolm III. called Canmore,
and is well known by the name of St. Mar|garet.</P>
<P>This Maurice being a man of parts and
merit, was highly e&s;teemed by king Malcolm,
who, to induce him to &s;ettle in Scotland, con|ferred
many favours upon him, and gave him
con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the &s;hires of Dun|barton
<PB N="548" REF="579">
and Stirling, particularly the lands of
Ro&s;eneath, Cardro&s;s, Auchindown, the lands
and pari&s;h of Drymen or Drummond, which
la&s;t afterwards became the chief title and &s;ir|name
of the family. He al&s;o made him &s;ene|&s;cal
or &s;teward of Lennox, and a&s;&s;igned him
for his armorial bearing three bars wavy, or
undy, <HI>gules,</HI> in memory of his having been
the happy conductor of her maje&s;ty's &s;afe
landing in Scotland.</P>
<P>The queen al&s;o be&s;towed &s;ome marks of
her e&s;teem upon him, and, for his good &s;er|vices,
gave him one of her maids of honour
in marriage. By her he had a &s;on named,</P>
<P>II. MALCOLM, of whom all the Drum|monds
in Scotland are de&s;cended.</P>
<P>He left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>III. MAURICE, who &s;ucceeded him, and
was father of</P>
<P>IV. JOHN, his heir, who had a &s;on and
&s;ucce&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>V. Sir MALCOLM DRYMEN, or DRUM|MOND,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus our hi&s;torians have deduced their de|&s;cent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strathallan, Sir George MacKenzie, Hathornden, Bayle, Mar|tin, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>
without mentioning their marriages.</P>
<P>The following &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is atte&s;ted by in|di&s;putable
documents.</P>
<P>This &s;ir Malcolm flouri&s;hed in the reign of
king William, who &s;ucceeded to the crown of
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165, and died in 1214.</P>
<P>He left i&s;&s;ue two &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Malcolm Beg Drummond,</HI> his heir.</P>

is de&s;igned brother of Malcolm
Beg, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1234.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>VI. MALCOLM de DRUMMOND, who,
on account of his low &s;tature, was called Beg,
which, in the old Galick language, &s;ignifies
&s;hort.</P>
<P>Though this Malcolm is the fir&s;t of the fa|mily
for whom we have any written docu|ments,
the &s;ituation in which we find him
&s;eems to be a &s;trong confirmation of the tra|ditional
account already narrated. He is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of all the lands &s;aid to have been given
to his predece&s;&s;ors by Malcolm Canmore, is in
high reputation in Scotland, and married a lady
of the very fir&s;t di&s;tinction for birth and for|tune,

rank and con&s;equence were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the

was one of the greate&s;t men of his time, and

<P>It does not appear that he meddled in court
affairs during the admini&s;tration of the dukes
of Albany; but when the amba&s;&s;adors for

reigns of king James III. and IV. and was

of his time.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the lords of &s;e&s;&s;i|on,
for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, <HI>anno</HI> 1471.</P>
<P>He purcha&s;ed from &s;ir Maurice Drummond

of the earldom of Strathearn, upon which he
got a charter under the great &s;eal, <HI>anno</HI> 1474.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1484, he was, by king James
III. appointed one of the amba&s;&s;adors extraor|dinary
to the court of England; and in No|vember
thereafter, obtained a &s;afe conduct,
<HI>ad tractandum cum rege Angliae, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XII. p. 230, and 251.</NOTE> and a truce
was agreed upon to la&s;t for three years.</P>
<P>Sir John, having acquitted him&s;elf in his
negociations, greatly to the &s;atisfaction of his
maje&s;ty and the whole nation, was, at the next
en&s;uing parliament, rai&s;ed to the dignity of
the peerage by the title of lord Drummond,
on the 14th January 1487, according to the&s;e
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Quo die dominus Johannes Drummond

<P>He afterwards got a charter under the great
&s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Johanni domino Drummond,</HI> of &s;everal

<P>This noble lord was unhappily engaged
with the di&s;contented party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE> again&s;t king
James III. after the coronation of James IV.
when the earl of Lennox, in the We&s;t, in
the North, and other parts of the kingdom,
the earl mari&s;hal, lords Forbes and Lyle, took
arms, and ju&s;tified their rebellion by the pre|tence
of revenging the late king's death.
Lord Drummond was &s;ent to &s;top Lennox's
progre&s;s, and prevent him from joining his
friends and confederates; and finding him
<PB N="552" REF="583">
encamped at Tillymo&s;s, a few miles above
Stirling, with 2000 men, carele&s;s of danger,
and dreading no &s;urpri&s;e, he attacked his camp
in the night, with the greate&s;t intrepidity;
the advanced guards were killed, or driven
back, confu&s;ion and di&s;cord &s;pread through e|very
quarter, and the whole body in a very
&s;hort time, wereall de&s;troyed, taken pri&s;oners,
or di&s;per&s;ed by this &s;pirited enterpri&s;e, qua&s;h|ing
a formidable in&s;urrection in the begin|ning,
giving nerves and &s;trength to the new
e&s;tabli&s;hed government, and peace and quiet
to the whole nation.</P>
<P>The lord Drummond was appointed one
of the privy council to king James IV. and
ju&s;ticiar of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1489.</P>
<P>He got many charters under the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
<HI>Johanni domino Drummond, ju&s;ticiario Scotiae,
inter</HI> 1490 <HI>et</HI> 1500, and was afterwards made
ju&s;tice general of all Scotland.</P>
<P>As he had &s;ome time before acquired the
lands and barony of Concraig, in Perth&s;hire,
from the above de&s;igned Maurice Drummond,
he obtained a licence, under the great &s;eal, to
build a ca&s;tle and fortalice on the&s;e lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et in ar|chiv. fam. de Perth.</NOTE> and
accordingly built a mo&s;t noble and &s;tately
ca&s;tle, and gave it the name of Drummond-ca&s;tle,
which hath ever &s;ince been one of the
chief &s;eats of the family.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the amba&s;&s;adors
extraordinary to the court of England, <HI>anno</HI>
1495, and again in 1503, where he is de&s;ign|ed
<HI>ju&s;ticiarius totius regni Scotiae.</HI> He was al|&s;o
one of the Scotch plenipotentiaries to the
court of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1511, and again in
1513; and was one of the Scotch nobility
who &s;igns the an&s;wer of refu&s;al to the king of
England, touching his advice to remove the
duke of Albany from the guardian&s;hip of the
young king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XII. p. 557, tom. XIII. p. 305, 346, 551, &amp;c.</NOTE> to which his &s;eal is appended,
4th July 1516. This is the la&s;t time we
find him engaged in any public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But we cannot omit here to mention one
remarkable occurrence that happened to this
great man in his old age, <HI>viz.</HI> He had given
&s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ence to the duke of Albany, then re|gent,
by promoting the marriage of his grand|&s;on,
the earl of Angus, with Margaret Tudor,
the widow of king James IV. The lord lyon
king at arms was therefore &s;ent to apprehend
him. It &s;eems the lord lyon did not treat
him with that re&s;pect that he thought his qua|lity
de&s;erved, he therefore gave him a box o'
the ear, which was thought a degree of trea|&s;on,
and was made u&s;e of as a handle again&s;t
him by his enemies. In &s;hort, he was tried
capitally, found guilty, and forfeited, <HI>anno</HI>
1515;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> but in the very next parliament, his
attainder was repealed, and him&s;elf re&s;tored to
all his e&s;tates, honours and dignities, <HI>anno</HI> 1516.</P>
<P>We have many in&s;tances of his acts of pie|ty,
<HI>viz.</HI> he having acquired the lands of Inch|affrie,
<HI>anno</HI> 1508, founded there a collegiate
church, which he largely endowed with a
revenue &s;ufficient for the maintenance of a
provo&s;t, and &s;everal prebends, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Lind&s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Perth, and Crawf. M. S. hi&s;t. thereof.</NOTE> daugh|ter

room for a daughter of England. She bore

with the Murrays, who had openly de|fied
him, and had actually gone, in a forcible

lands in the pari&s;h of Monivaird, he marched
with his followers in order to prevent them,
and being accidentally joined by Duncan
Campbell, captain of Dun&s;taffnage, who had
come down from Argyle-&s;hire with a party of
his men to revenge the death of his father-in-law,
Drummond of Meuie, whom, with
his two &s;ons, &s;ome of the Murrays had late|ly
killed; upon their approach, the Murrays
fled to the kirk of Monivaird for refuge, whi|ther
they were al&s;o followed by the Drum|monds
party. The ma&s;ter being &s;atisfied with
driving them off the field, was returning home,
when a &s;hot, fired from the kirk, unluckily
killed one of the Dun&s;taffnage men, which &s;o

<P>They all had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Agnes, daughter and co|heire&s;s
of John Drummond of Innerpeffry,
by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He died before the year 1600, and was
&s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XX. JAMES, fourth lord Drummond, a
man of extraordinary natural endowments,
improved by a polite and learned education.
After having &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in
France, and acquired the ea&s;y manners and
addre&s;s of that elegant nation, he returned
to Britain, where he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
at the court of king James VI. by hi
graceful behaviour, and &s;hining parts. He
was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Philip the III. of Spain,
together with the earl of Nottinghame, lord
high admiral of England, in order to &s;ettle
the ratification of the treaty of peace betwixt
the two nations, and to endeavour to recon|cile
matters betwixt Spain and Holland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in arch. fam. de Perth, haered. ma&s;c. quibu&s;|cunq. Craw|furd's M. S. p, 123.</NOTE> and
having acquitted him&s;elf in that negotiation
with dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s, his maje&s;ty, im|mediately
upon his return, was plea&s;ed to dig|nify
him with the title of earl of Perth, by
patent, to him and his heirs-male what&s;om|ever,
dated 4th March 1605; and got char|ters
under the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Jacobo comiti de

But the&s;e promi&s;ing appearances, that portend|ed
&s;uch honour to his family and country,
were &s;oon bla&s;ted by an untimely death,
which carried him off in the very bloom of
his years, <HI>anno</HI> 1611.</P>
<P>He married lady I&s;abel Seton, daughter of
Robert fir&s;t earl of Winton, by whom he had
only one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Jane Drummond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Sutherland.</NOTE> married to John
earl of Sutherland, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He having no &s;ons, his e&s;tate and honours
devolved upon his brorher,</P>

<P>He was a man of great learning, probity
and integrity, of un&s;haken loyalty to his prince,
of &s;teady attachment to the intere&s;t of his
country, kind and benevolent to his friends,
careful in managing the affairs of his family
with prudence and oeconomy, and &s;ingularly
ju&s;t in all his dealings.</P>
<P>He was one of the peers that &s;at on the
jury when Patrick earl of Orkney was tried
for trea&s;on and rebellion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spoti&s;wood's hi&s;tory.</NOTE> who &s;uffered accord|ingly,
<HI>anno</HI> 1614.</P>
<P>Though this noble lord was appointed a
privy councillor for life, by the parliament in
1641,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;cinded acts of parl.</NOTE> yet he was a man of &s;teady loyalty,
and a mo&s;t faithful &s;ubject to the king.</P>
<P>He joined the great Montro&s;e, was taken
pri&s;oner at the battle of Philiphaugh; was,
with his &s;on lord Drummond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthrie's me|moirs, and Cromwell's act of indem|nity.</NOTE> fined by Oliver
Cromwell, in the &s;um of five thou&s;and pounds

<P>He married lady Jean Ker, elde&s;t daughter
of Robert earl of Roxburgh, by whom he had
four &s;ons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Henry,</HI> lord Drummond, who died in
infancy.</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1662, and was &s;ucceeded by

<P>XXI. JAMES, third earl of Perth, who, be|ing
young when the unhappy troubles in king
Charles I.'s reign began, was at fir&s;t engaged
on the parliament's &s;ide, but &s;o &s;oon as Mon|tro&s;e

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1675, and was &s;ucceeded by
his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XXII. JAMES, fourth earl of Perth, a man
of fine natural parts, great probity and ho|nour;
who having got an education &s;uitable
<PB N="553" REF="586">
to his noble birth, became one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed
men of his time.</P>
<P>He was in great favour with king Charles
II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of council, and commi&s;&s;ions in the public regi&s;ter.</NOTE> who appointed him one of his privy coun|cil,
<HI>anno</HI> 1678, lord ju&s;tice-general, <HI>anno</HI> 1682,
and lord high chancellor of Scotland, 23d June
1684.</P>
<P>When the duke of York, (afterwards king
James VII.) came to Scotland in 1679, he
contracted a more than ordinary friend&s;hip
for the earl of Perth, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted invio|late
to the end of his days.</P>
<P>Upon his royal highne&s;s's acce&s;&s;ion to the
throne of great Britain, in 1685, he not only
continued the earl of Perth in the chancellor's
office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ion in the public regi&s;ter.</NOTE> but appointed him high &s;heriff of Mid-Lothian,
and governor of the Ba&s;s.</P>
<P>Certain it is no man in Scotland had a
greater &s;hare of king James's confidence and
e&s;teem than this noble lord; and it is as cer|tain
his maje&s;ty had not one &s;ubject in the
whole kingdom, that &s;erved him with more
fidelity and honour.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by a noble author, that the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was never carried
on with more temper and impartiality than
during this period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs.</NOTE></P>
<P>He made a re&s;ignation in the king's hands,
of the earldom of Perth, and his whole other
lands, with the heretable offices of the &s;tew|arty,
coroner&s;hip and fore&s;try of Strathearn,
Glenerty, and Ballwhidder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in favours
of James lord Drummond, his elde&s;t &s;on, and
the heirs-male procreate, or to be procreate,
of his body; which failing, to the &s;aid James
lord Drummond, and his other heirs-male
what&s;oever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereupon he expede a
charter under the great &s;eal, in which their
whole lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family, and chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> lying in the &s;tewarty of Strath|earn,
are particularly enumerated, dated in
November 1687.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, when the ancient order
of the thi&s;tle was revived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs</NOTE> the lord chancel|lor
was named the fir&s;t knight of that or|der.</P>
<P>At the revolution, when king James went
over to France, the mob begun to commit
great di&s;orders in Scotland. The chancellor
being obnoxious to them, on account of his
religion, was advi&s;ed by his friends (and in|deed
it was his own inclination) to follow his
maje&s;ty. He accordingly, (with his lady and
family) embarked in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el at Burnt-i&s;land,
but was pur&s;ued by a long-boat from
Kirkcaldy, full of armed men. His lord&s;hip,
being noways provided for &s;uch an attack,
was &s;oon forced to &s;urrender. He and his
lady were plundered of all they had by the ruf|fians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and brought back. The chancellor was
impri&s;oned in the common tolbooth of Kirk|caldy,
and mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>He was afterwards carried to the ca&s;tle of
Stirling, where he remained pri&s;oner near four
years, and was at la&s;t &s;et at liberty upon his
promi&s;ing to tran&s;port him&s;elf beyond &s;eas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
without any rea&s;on being given for his being
&s;o long confined.</P>
<P>He went fir&s;t to Rome, where he &s;taid a|bout
two years, when his old ma&s;ter &s;ent for
him. He came to him at St. Germains in
France, where his maje&s;ty heaped all the ho|nours
and favours upon him that were in his
power to be&s;tow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's M. S. hi&s;t. of the fam. and lives of the offic. of &s;tate, p. 233.</NOTE> He created him duke of
Perth, (the patent is &s;aid to be to his heirs-male,)
fir&s;t lord of the bed-chamber, knight
of the garter, and chamberlain to the queen.
He al&s;o appointed him governor to his &s;on.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, lady Jane Douglas, daugh|ter
of William marquis of Douglas, by lady
Mary Gordon his &s;econd lady, and by her had
i&s;&s;ue one &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> lord Drummond,&mdash;and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married to William ninth
earl Mari&s;hal, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Lilias, daughter of &s;ir
James Drummond of Machany, counte&s;s dow|ager
of Tullibardin, by whom he had two &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> who died without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He married, 3dly, lady Mary Gordon,
daughter of Lewis marquis of Huntly, by whom
he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> commonly called lord Edward,
who will be mentioned hereafter,&mdash;and a
daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Tere&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>This noble peer died at St. Germains in
May 1716, and was interred in the chapel of
the Scotch college at Paris.</P>
<P>XXIII. JAMES, elde&s;t &s;on of the chancel|lor,
commonly de&s;igned marquis of Drum|mond,
was educated in France, and improved
his education by travelling into all the coun|tries
in Europe, where &s;trangers re&s;ort to ac|quire
the knowledge of men and things. His
acquaintance with the mo&s;t polite courts, gave
him all the ea&s;y addre&s;s and genteel behavi|our
that di&s;tingui&s;h the man of fa&s;hion; and
an abundant &s;tock of good natural parts made
him reap the advantages that men of &s;en&s;e on|ly
can acquire from an intercour&s;e with fo|reign
nations. He &s;tuck fa&s;t to the princi|ples
of his family, and attached him&s;elf firm|ly
to the hou&s;e of Stewart. He attended
king James VII. in his expedition to Ireland,
<PB N="554" REF="587">
and after the battle of the Boyne, and the total
reduction of that kingdom by king William,
when there &s;eemed no further appearance of
any &s;cheme to bring about his favourite cau&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hi&s;tory of the family.</NOTE>
he returned to Scotland.</P>
<P>As he was zealous for the honour and in|dependency
of his country, he oppo&s;ed the u|nion
&s;trenuou&s;ly, as, in his opinion, evidently
tending to de&s;troy both.</P>
<P>It is much for the credit, and &s;hows the
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, of this nobleman, that though
he was forward on every occa&s;ion, to contri|bute
every thing, to the utmo&s;t of his power,
to bring back the exiled family, and was edu|cated,
and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the principles
of the church of Rome, yet when the plot
was carrying on in 1708 to effectuate that re|&s;toration,
he in&s;i&s;ts, as a preliminary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hook's nego|tiations.</NOTE> to &s;e|cure
to a Prote&s;tant people the Prote&s;tant re|ligion,
as well as their civil liberties.</P>
<P>Upon the earl of Marr's in&s;urrection in
1715, the marquis of Drummond was a man
of great con&s;equence in that cau&s;e, by the
connections he had with &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable chieftains of the clans, and the
tru&s;t they repo&s;ed in him. Accordingly he
joined the earl with all the force he could
rai&s;e, and behaved with great gallantry at the
battle of Dunblain. After that attempt was
di&s;concerted, and the partizans of the hou&s;e of
Stewart were entirely di&s;per&s;ed, he made his
e&s;cape to France, where he died, and was bu|ried
near his father, in the chapel of the Scotch
college of Paris.</P>
<P>He married lady Jane, daughter of George
duke of Gordon, by whom he had two &s;ons,
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> commonly called lord John
Drummond.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter, lady <HI>Mary Drummond.</HI></P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Henriet,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>XXIV. JAMES, elde&s;t &s;on of John marquis
of Drummond, commonly called duke of
Perth, &s;ucceededed to the whole e&s;tate. He
was &s;ent abroad in his infancy, to be educat|ed
at the Scotch college of Doway; and, af|ter
having gone through the cour&s;e of &s;tu|dies
u&s;ually taught in &s;uch &s;eminaries, and ob|tained
a competent &s;hare of academical learn|ing,
for his further improvement he went to
Paris, where he acquired tho&s;e exerci&s;es and
accompli&s;hments that are nece&s;&s;ary for a
young nobleman. He was a good mathema|tician,
and drew with the accuracy and ta&s;te
of a ma&s;ter. About the time of his majori|ty,
he returned to Scotland, and applied him|&s;elf
entirely to the management of his pri|vate
affairs, to the encouragement of the li|beral
as well as the u&s;eful arts, to the improve|ment
of husbandry and the manufactures, not
only upon his own e&s;tate, but through the
whole kingdom, wherever his influence ex|tended,
and thereby became a mo&s;t excellent
member of civil life. As he had early im|bibed
all the principles of his family, and de|voted
him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the hou&s;e of
Stewart, &s;o &s;oon as Charles, the young pre|tender,
arrived, he was among&s;t the fir&s;t of
tho&s;e who joined his &s;tandard, with all the
force he could rai&s;e. He was his fir&s;t lieu|tenant-general
at the battle of Pre&s;ton, com|manded
at the &s;iege of Carli&s;le and Stirling,
and during the whole time of the rebellion,
on every occa&s;ion acted with the greate&s;t
courage and conduct, having no other point
in view, but, as far as in him lay, to promote
the good of the cau&s;e in which he was em|barked.
In &s;pite of a very delicate con&s;titu|tion,
he underwent the greate&s;t of fatigues,
and was the fir&s;t on every occa&s;ion of duty,
where his head or his hands could be of u&s;e,
bold as a lion in the field of battle, but ever
merciful in the hour of victory. With an heart
open to all the delicate feelings of humanity,
the&s;e mild and gentle affections that peculi|arly
di&s;tingui&s;hed the brave, filled his brea&s;t
with univer&s;al benevolence, made him atten|tive
to relieve the mi&s;eries and calamities of
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, where-ever he found them,
and put him always in remembrance, that
no di&s;tinction of party can blot out the cha|racter
of MAN.</P>
<P>After the battle of Cullodden he embark|ked
for France; but by this time his con&s;ti|tution
being quite exhau&s;ted, with the fa|tigues
he had undergone, he died in the pa&s;|&s;age
upon the 13th day of May 1746. His
body was kept for &s;ome days, in expecta|tion
of making the land, but being detain|ed
by contrary winds, at la&s;t it was obliged
to be buried in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>By an act of parliament it was declared,
that all per&s;ons that were concerned in the
rebellion, and did not &s;urrender before the
month of July, &s;hould be deemed convicts
for high trea&s;on. But as this James died be|fore
the limited time, the attainder did not
take place again&s;t him: however it &s;ell with
all its weight upon his brother and heir lord
John, who was embarked in the &s;ame cau&s;e,
and in his per&s;on the whole e&s;tate of Perth
was forfeited to the crown. This John
was educated at Doway, where he very &s;oon
di&s;covered a &s;trong propen&s;ity and forward ge|nius
towards a military life, and accordingly
the bent of his &s;tudies were turned that way.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="588">
After having acquired &s;ome of the accompli&s;h|ments
nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;oldier, he entered into
the &s;ervice of the king of France; and when
he had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal gradations, got
the command of a regiment, which he rai&s;ed
him&s;elf, and was named the Royal Scotch.
He had the &s;ame warmth and affection for the
intere&s;t of the hou&s;e of Stewart that his bro|ther
and father had, and commanded the
French piquets that were &s;ent over in 1745,
in &s;upport of that cau&s;e. During the time
of the rebellion, he always acted as a good
officer, and his corps was of con&s;iderable ad|vantage
on &s;everal occa&s;ions to his party. Af|ter
the defeat at Cullodden, he made his e|&s;cape
to France in the &s;ame &s;hip in which
his brother embarked, and re&s;umed the com|mand
of his own regiment under the conduct
of Mar&s;hal Saxe in Flanders, where he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions, but in none
more than in the care and concern he &s;how|ed
for any of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects that were
taken pri&s;oners, or in di&s;tre&s;s. Here he ex|erted
the genero&s;ity of his mind, and di&s;play|ed
that goodne&s;s of heart that ever di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
true nobility. After the &s;iege of Ber|gen-op-Zoom,
he was appointed a major-ge|neral,
when lying ill of a fever, of which he
&s;oon thereafter died, and was buried in the
chapel of the Engli&s;h nuns at Antwerp. He
al&s;o leaving no i&s;&s;ue, the repre&s;entation de|volved
upon his uncle,</P>
<P>Lord John Drummond, before mentioned,
who was elde&s;t &s;on of the chancellor's &s;econd
marriage. He had a noble and liberal edu|cation,
having &s;pent a great part of his young|er
years in foreign parts, particularly at the
courts of France and Spain. He was ma&s;ter
of a dignity of manners, that claimed the e|&s;teem
of every body, kind and benevolent to
his friends, affable and polite in his behaviour
to all men, firm and &s;teady in the principles
which he believed right; and though dive&s;t|ed
of an opulent e&s;tate, by the attainder of
his nephew, upon an incon&s;iderable fortune of
his own, he maintained the dignity of his
family, and always appeared on every occa&s;i|on
in a manner &s;uitable to his rank. He mar|ried,
1&s;t, the heire&s;s of Balegarno; 2dly, la|dy
Mary Stewart, daughter of Charles earl
of Traquair, but died without i&s;&s;ue at Edin|burgh,
<HI>anno</HI> 1757, and was buried in the ab|bay
church of Holyrood-hou&s;e. The next in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was his brother,</P>
<P>Lord Edward Drummond, only &s;on of the
chancellor's third marriage, born in Stir|ling
ca&s;tle, during his father's confinement.
He went very early abroad to France, where
he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time, and liv|ed
in a great retirement, being very booki&s;h,
and, in a manner, quite devoted to religious
duties.</P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth, daughter of
Charles earl of Middleton; but dying with|out
i&s;&s;ue at Paris, <HI>anno</HI> 1760, in him ended
the male-line of the chancellor's body, where|by
the repre&s;entation of that mo&s;t noble and
illu&s;trious family devolves upon James Drum|mond
of Lundin, grand-&s;on of John earl of
Melfort, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XXII. JOHN, earl of Melfort, was &s;e|cond
&s;on of James third earl of Perth, and
brother-german to the chancellor.</P>
<P>To the account we have already given of
this noble peer, page 468th of this work,
we mu&s;t here &s;ubjoin, that after the revolu|tion,
when principle induced him to &s;acrifice
all, and follow the fortunes of king James
VII. that &s;ame addre&s;s, that &s;ame genius, and
acutene&s;s of parts which di&s;tingui&s;hed him
in Britain, made him admired at the court of
France, and continued him a fir&s;t favourite
of his unfortunate ma&s;ter. The favourites
of princes are always the objects of envy, and
the voice of &s;lander, and detraction is ever
loud and noi&s;y again&s;t them. This Melfort
found from the tongues and pens of many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's diary.</NOTE>
as much beneath the con&s;ideration of the pu|blick,
as unworthy the nobility and rank of
tho&s;e who propagated the calumny:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs.</NOTE> As we
dare venture to challenge any per&s;on to &s;hew,
from &s;ufficient proof, that he ever betrayed
the intere&s;t of his ma&s;ter, or deviated from
the&s;e principles of honour and truth for which
his family have always been remarkable.</P>
<P>He married, 1&s;t, Sophia, daughter and &s;ole
heire&s;s of Margaret Lundin of that ilk (heire&s;s
of that antient family) by her husband Ro|bert
Maitland, &s;econd brother of John duke
of Lauderdale, by whom he had two &s;ons,
and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir apparent, who died un|married.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert,</HI> who carried on the line of the
family.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to &s;ir
John Hou&s;toun of that ilk, baronet, and had
i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to William
vi&s;count of Strathallan, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married, 1&s;t, to Walter
Scot of High-Che&s;ter; 2dly, to &s;ir James
Sharp, Bart. and had i&s;&s;ue to both.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Eupheme, daughter of

<PB N="556" REF="589">
fir&s;t marriage, &s;ucceeding to his mo|ther's

repre&s;entative of that mo&s;t antient and illu|&s;trious

<P>Upon the death of lord Edward Drum|mond,
the la&s;t male de&s;cendant of the chan|cellor's

that the attainder of the lord Drummond,

the chancellor never having been attainted,
and his i&s;&s;ue-male being now extinct, this
James (as we are informed) is entitled to the

<P>It may be here ob&s;erved, that this noble

<P>This &s;ir William was a man of fine natural

a man of the fir&s;t rank.</P>
<P>He obtained a &s;afe conduct from king Ri|chard

<P>In 1416, a treaty was &s;et on foot for re|lieving
the king, which proceeded &s;o far, that
the king of England con&s;ented to his coming
to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae, tom. IX. p. 417.</NOTE> provided he &s;hould return again&s;t

did not take effect.</P>
<P>In 1420, the Engli&s;h carried king James
to France, in hopes of drawing the Scotch
auxiliaries over to their intere&s;t, by their
king's pre&s;ence in their army.</P>
<P>Sir William, at this time, intending to wait
on the king in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. X. p. 9.</NOTE> obtained a &s;afe conduct
from king Henry V. of England, for him&s;elf
and twenty of his retinue. He arrived in France,
and waited on the king accordingly; but it
does not appear that he or any of the Scots
could be prevailed on to de&s;ert their old allies
the French, tho' their king was in the army
again&s;t them; well knowing, that if their
royal ma&s;ter had not been a pri&s;oner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 254.</NOTE> he would
not have been there on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>This great man, being in high favour with
king James I. had the honour of knighthood

1667; and in 1680, by a commi&s;&s;ion un|der
the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> he was made ju&s;tice-gene|ral
of Scotland.</P>
<P>In his father's lifetime he got two charters
under the great &s;eal, <HI>Willielmo domino de

<P>In February 1682, he was created lord

vi&s;count of Nith, Torthorald and Ro&s;s, earl
of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and marquis of
Queensberry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as a mark of the royal fa|vour,
on account of his own, and the un&s;ha|ken
loyalty of his noble progenitors.</P>
<P>In April 1682, he obtained the king's ma|nuel,
to the lord lyon king at arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 77.</NOTE> ordering
the double tre&s;&s;ure to be &s;uperadded to his
armorial bearings, as it is in the royal at|chievement.</P>
<P>In May thereafter, he was con&s;tituted lord
high trea&s;urer of Scotland.</P>
<P>In September, he was made con&s;table and
governor of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and one
of the extraordinary lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, holding
at the &s;ame time divers military commi&s;&s;ions
be&s;ides: and indeed there were few great of|fices
in Scotland, whether &s;acred, civil, or
military, that, upon every vacancy, were not
left to his di&s;po&s;al during the latter part of
this reign; the king, and his brother the duke
of Albany and York, having delegated to him
almo&s;t all their authority in that kingdom.
This is fully in&s;tructed by a va&s;t number of
letters from the duke of Albany to this noble
duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes ducem de Queen&s;|berry.</NOTE> &s;till pre&s;erved in the family.</P>

Queensberry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by letters patent, to him and
his male i&s;&s;ue, dated 3d November 1684,
and was afterwards made one of the lords of
the privy council in both kingdoms.</P>
<P>Upon king James's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,
he was not only continued in his former po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s

to repre&s;ent his maje&s;ty's royal per|&s;on

in the parliament of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1685;
and he and his &s;on, the earl of Drumlanrig,
were at the &s;ame time con&s;tituted the king's
lieutenants in the county of Dumfries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In 1686, he was made pre&s;ident of the
council; but as he did not altogether comply
with the mea&s;ures of the&s;e times, but oppo&s;ed
the project of taking away the penal laws and
te&s;t, he was &s;oon after laid entirely a&s;ide.</P>
<P>He then retired to his &s;eat at Drumlanrig,
where he lived to the end of his days, in great
&s;plendor and magnificence: he rebuilt his fine
ca&s;tle there, which, with it's gardens, now
highly improved and fini&s;hed, yields to none
in Scotland for &s;tateline&s;s and elegance.</P>
<P>He al&s;o greatly improved his e&s;tate, which
had been much impaired by the loyalty and
&s;ufferings of his father and grand-father, and
the iniquities of the&s;e unhappy times.</P>
<P>He married lady I&s;abel, daughter of Willi|am
marquis of Douglas, by whom he had
three &s;ons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> created earl of March, to
whom he gave a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in Tweed|dale.

who died unmarried, <HI>anno</HI> 1693.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to David
earl of Wemy&s;s, and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The duke dying in 1695, was &s;ucceeded
by his elde&s;t &s;on,</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, &s;econd duke of Queensberry,
a man of great abilities, and fine accompli&s;h|ments,
both natural and acquired.</P>
<P>After he had fini&s;hed the cour&s;e of his tra|vels,
king Charles II. immediately upon his
return home, made him one of his privy
council for Scotland, and lieutenant-colonel of
the regiment of hor&s;e commanded by general
Graham, afterwards vi&s;count of Dundee, <HI>anno</HI>
1684: which offices he enjoyed till the year
1688, that he was laid a&s;ide for not comply|ing
with the mea&s;ures of the court.</P>
<P>He came early into the revolution, and was
made colonel of the Scotch hor&s;e-guards by
the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>After that prince was declared king, his com|mi&s;&s;ion
was renewed, and he was made one of
the lords of the privy-council and exchequer,
and one of the lords of the bed-chamber.</P>
<P>In 1690, king William &s;ent him to com|mand
a body of troops in Scotland under ge|neral
Mackay.</P>
<P>In 1692, he was made one of the lords of
the trea&s;ury, and in 1693, he had a patent to
&s;it and vote in parliament as a peer, being then
lord high trea&s;urer of Scotland, and an officer
of &s;tate, his father being then alive.</P>
<P>In 1695, he gave up all his military em|ployments,
was made lord privy &s;eal, and one
of the extraordinary lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1700, he was appointed lord high com|mi&s;&s;ioner,
to repre&s;ent his maje&s;ty's royal per|&s;on
for two &s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament in Scotland.
When he returned to court in 1701, he was
elected a knight of the mo&s;t noble order of
the garter, and was in&s;talled at Wind&s;or on
the 10th July following.</P>
<P>Queen Anne, being &s;en&s;ible that the duke
had &s;erved king William with great fidelity,
immediately upon her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne,
made him &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland;
and having a great opinion of his abilities and
good conduct, did al&s;o con&s;titute him her high
commi&s;&s;ioner in 1702, to repre&s;ent her maje|&s;ty
in the Scotch parliament; and then being
appointed fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner, on the part of
Scotland, to treat of an union between the two
nations, he &s;et out for London accordingly.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners met at the Cockpit on
22d October; but things not being ripe for
accompli&s;hing the intended union, her maje&s;ty
again honoured the duke with the office of
high commi&s;&s;ioner to the parliament of Scot|land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1703.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t matters went on pretty &s;moothly;
but after the act of &s;ecurity for the kingdom
of Scotland came to be &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on,
nothing could be brought to a conclu&s;ion that
&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho' the di&s;putes (which run very high)
were managed with great dexterity by the com|mi&s;&s;ioner;
and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome u&s;eful bills,
he put an end to that &s;e&s;&s;ion the 6th September.</P>
<P>In 1704, upon a change of &s;ome mea&s;ures
at court, he was removed from all his public
employments; but in July 1705, he was a|gain
made fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury,
and lord privy &s;eal, and al&s;o re&s;tored to his
places in the privy council and exchequer.</P>
<P>In November following, her maje&s;ty was
plea&s;ed to direct a commi&s;&s;ion to him to re|pre&s;ent
her per&s;on as &s;overeign of the noble
order of St. Andrew; by virtue whereof, he,
with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity, did inve&s;t William
Ker, marquis of Lothian, with the &s;aid order.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try, on account of the
forementioned act of &s;ecurity, thought them|&s;elves
under a nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to ef|fectuate
an union betwixt the two crowns; and
her maje&s;ty being impowered, by the parlia|ment
1705, to nominate commi&s;&s;ioners to
treat with tho&s;e of England, for that purpo&s;e,
the duke of Queensberry, now lord privy
&s;eal, was one of the number.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners of both kingdoms met
accordingly at London in April 1706, and a|gain&s;t
the 22d day of July thereafter, every
article thereof was by them agreed to.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="600">
In June the &s;ame year, upon his own re|&s;ignation,
he obtained a new diploma, extend|ing
the titles of duke of Queensberry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to
the heirs of entail of his family, whether male
or female,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes ducem de Queen&s;|berry.</NOTE> with rank and precedency accord|ing
to the former diploma in 1684.</P>
<P>The parliament of Scotland being to meet
at Edinburgh on the 3d of September follow|ing,
his grace the duke of Queensberry was a|gain
appointed her maje&s;ty's high commi&s;&s;ioner,
being judged the fitte&s;t per&s;on in the kingdom
to bring about that great and important work
of the union, which was accordingly brought
to a conclu&s;ion (though not without great op|po&s;ition)
on 10th January 1707. After which,
the duke was elected one of the &s;ixteen Scotch
peers, in the fir&s;t Briti&s;h parliament.</P>
<P>Before he arrived at London, he was met
at &s;ome miles di&s;tance from that great metro|polis,
by many noblemen and gentlemen in
their coaches, and on hor&s;eback; and next
morning waited on the queen at Ken&s;ington,
where he found that gracious reception which
his great &s;ervices had merited.</P>
<P>Her maje&s;ty immediately &s;ettled on him a
pen&s;ion of 3000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling <HI>per annum</HI> out of
the po&s;t office; and, as a further mark of her
royal favour, in May 1708, created him a
peer of Great Britain, by the titles of baron of
Rippon, marquis of Beverly, and duke of Do|ver;
which honours were to de&s;cend to
Charles earl of Solway, then his &s;econd &s;on.</P>
<P>In 1710, he was appointed one of the
principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate for both king|doms:
which office he enjoyed as long as he
lived. He was al&s;o made joint keeper of the

<P>He married Mary Boyle, &s;econd daughter of
Charles lord Clifford, elde&s;t &s;on to Richard earl
of Burlington and Cork, by lady Jean Seymour,

<P>The duke died at London on the 6th July
1711, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>

&s;ervices done to the crown by his father and
ance&s;tors, was created earl of Solway, <HI>anno</HI>
1706, when very young, his elder brother
being then alive.</P>
<P>When he came to be of age, he claimed
his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers, as duke of Do|ver;
but as, by the articles of the union, 'tis
alledged that no Scotch peer can be made a
Briti&s;h peer, the hou&s;e of lords therefore &s;et
a&s;ide his claim at that time.</P>
<P>This duke was made lord of the bed-cham|ber
to king George I. was one of the privy
council both to kings George I. and II. and
was appointed vice admiral of Scotland by the
latter. He was al&s;o lord of the bed-chamber

Wales, was appointed lord keeper of the great

council to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty; and, upon the
death of the marquis of Tweeddale, in 1762,

Sardinian maje&s;ty ordered his amba&s;&s;ador at the
court of Britain to wait on the duke of Queen&s;|berry,

<P>THE progenitors of the hou&s;e of Mac|Kay
were &s;ettled, and had con&s;iderable
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the northern counties of Scot|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. and Scotch compend. &amp;c.</NOTE>
as early as the reign of king Alexander
II. who &s;ucceeded to the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>A learned author, who wrote the hi&s;tory
of the earls of Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob. Gor|don's hi&s;tory, penes com. de Sutherland, p. 35, et 214.</NOTE> in a very elegant
manner, &s;ays, that before they had the &s;ir|name
of MacKay, they were called the clan
Wic-Worgan.</P>
<P>Other authors are of opinion, that one A|lexander,
&s;on of Ochonacker, came from Ire|land
to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch comp. and Salmon's abridgement.</NOTE> about the end of the 12th
century, &s;ettled in the northern parts, and was
progenitor of the clan MacKay.</P>
<P>The traditional account of the family is,
that Alexander, a younger &s;on of John, fir&s;t
of the family of Forbes, was the immediate
ance&s;tor of this noble family. This &s;eems
probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family, &amp;c.</NOTE> as in many authentic writs they
are de&s;igned MacKay <HI>alias</HI> Forbes, and &s;ome|times
there are Forbe&s;es <HI>alias</HI> MacKay.</P>
<P>We therefore proceed to deduce their de|&s;cent
from,</P>
<P>I. ALEXANDER, who flouri&s;hed in the
reign of king Alexander II. and was father of,</P>
<P>II. MAGNUS, who left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,

generally called the clan Wic-Worgan.</P>
<P>He le&s;t i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>IV. DONALD, who &s;ucceeded him, and
was de&s;igned &s;on of Morgan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob. Gor|don's hi&s;t. of Sutherland.</NOTE> &s;on of Mag|nus,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He lived in the reign of king David Bruce,
and married the daughter of Jye MacNeil-Ghika,
by whom he had a &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>V. JYE MORE, who&s;e &s;on Donald was
called Mack-Jye, (that is the &s;on of Jye)
and from hence he and his po&s;terity a&s;&s;umed
the &s;irname of MackJye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> afterwards called
Mackie, MacKay, or Macky.</P>
<P>This Jye More made a great figure in the
reign of Robert II. He was proprietor of the
lands of Farre, and &s;everal others, in Strath|naver,
and had many va&s;&s;als and followers.</P>
<P>This appears from the hi&s;tory of the earls
of Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 35.</NOTE> wherein are the&s;e words:
<Q REND="inline">"Nicholas earl of Sutherland had great con|trover&s;y
with the hou&s;e and family of Mac|kie,
chief of the clan Wic-Worgan, in
Strathnaver."</Q> <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e families, it &s;eems, had been at vari|ance
for &s;ome time; and in the beginning of
the reign of king Robert III. there was a meet|ing
appointed at Dingwall, to accommodate
and make up matters betwixt them. The
earl of Sutherland, Jye More, and Donald
MackJye, his &s;on, met at the time appointed,
but in&s;tead of a reconciliation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> a &s;cu&s;lle en&s;u|ed,
wherein both Jye More, and his &s;on Do|nald,
lo&s;t their lives, <HI>anno</HI> 1395. However,
this &s;ufficiently &s;hows, that the hou&s;e of Mac|kie,
or the clan Wic-Worgan, were very con|&s;iderable
in the reign of king Robert III.</P>
<P>VI. DONALD MACK'Y, or MACKIE, &s;on
and apparent heir of Jye More, married a
daughter of&mdash;MacLeod of Lewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE> by
whom he had four &s;ons.</P>

of Farre, and many others in Strathna|ver,
<HI>anno</HI> 1395.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the 15th century, Do|nald,
lord of the I&s;les, having been di&s;appoint|ed
of the earldom of Ro&s;s, to which he
thought he had a good title in right of his
wife, rai&s;ed a great body of men, and laid
wa&s;te all Sutherland, Ro&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Angus Mac|kie
of Farre rai&s;ed his Strathnaver men to op|po&s;e
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 38.</NOTE> They came to an engagement
near Dingwall and a bloody conflict en&s;ued,
but at la&s;t Mackie, being overpowered with
numbers, was taken pri&s;oner, <HI>anno</HI> 1410.</P>
<P>The lord of the I&s;les keeped him confined
for &s;ome time; but at la&s;t, he not only gave
him his liberty, but be&s;towed his daughter
upon him in marriage. He brought her home
with him to Strathnaver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE> and by her he had a
&s;on,</P>
<P><HI>Neil,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter Angus rai&s;ed a con&s;i|derable
body of his va&s;&s;als and followers, and
invaded Caithne&s;s, where he committed va&s;t
outrages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and ravaged and &s;poiled the whole
country, <HI>anno</HI> 1425.</P>
<P>But king James coming to the north coun|try
in per&s;on, <HI>anno</HI> 1426, Mackie threw him|&s;elf
at his maje&s;ty's feet, and implored his
mercy, who, out of his innate lenity and good|ne&s;s,
granted him pardon, but took his &s;on,
Neil, an ho&s;tage for the father's good behavi|our.
He confined him in the Ba&s;s for &s;ome
months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> but &s;et him at liberty <HI>anno</HI> 1427.</P>
<P>Angus died in 1428, and was &s;ucceeded by

no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, than he
rai&s;ed his men, invaded Caithne&s;s, &s;poiled the

brave &s;oldier.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of king James
II. there happened &s;ome variance between the
Keiths and the inhabitants of Caithne&s;s. The
Keiths de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the MacKays,
which was readily granted. Angus and his
brother John Roy, joined them with a con&s;i|derable
body of men, and they invaded Caith|ne&s;s.
The Caithne&s;s men were appri&s;ed of
their coming, and were prepared for them.
The two armies met at a place called Blair-Tannie,
where a cruel fight followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and the
Caithne&s;s men were overthrown, chiefly by
the bravery and conduct of Angus, <HI>anno</HI>
1438.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of the family of
MacKenzie, by whom he had three &s;ons and
one daughter.</P>

<P>In the end of the year 1442, or beginning
of 1443, Angus was burnt to death in the
church of Tarbet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 216.</NOTE> by the Ro&s;s men, whom he
had often mole&s;ted, and was &s;ucceeded by his

<P>And he dying &s;oon after his father, was

<P>IV. Sir ARCHIBALD PRIMROSE, who
having got a liberal education, was a man of
great accompli&s;hments, both natural and ac|quired,
and of &s;ingular loyalty, honour and
integrity.</P>
<P><PB N="576" REF="609">
He applied him&s;elf chiefly to the &s;tudy of
the laws, in which he became a great profi|cient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of council, and charta penes comitem de Ro&s;eberry.</NOTE>
and being highly e&s;teemed by king
Charles I. for his many eminent qualities,
was, by his maje&s;ty, with the approbation of
his whole council, appointed chief clerk of
the privy council, 2d September 1641; and,
by a letter under the king's own hand, was
ordered to tran&s;mit to court weekly all the
tran&s;actions of the council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> as his father had
done; in which he acquitted him&s;elf entirely
to his maje&s;ty's &s;atisfaction, till the troubles
in the country ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that a
corre&s;pondence of that kind was ab&s;olutely
impracticable.</P>
<P>As he was a mo&s;t &s;incere loyali&s;t, he join|ed
the marquis of Montro&s;e immediately af|ter
the battle of Kil&s;yth, and continued with
him till the unfortunate battle of Philiphangh,
where he was taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>He was afterwards tried by the parliament
of St. Andrews for high trea&s;on, and was
found guilty, <HI>anno</HI> 1646; but by the inter|ce&s;&s;ion
of the marquis of Argyle, and his o|ther
friends, his life was &s;pared, though he
remained in pri&s;on till the marquis of Mon|tro&s;e's
capitulation with the committee of e|&s;tates,
whereby the marquis was obliged to
depart the kingdom, and &s;ir Archibald, with
&s;ome others, obtained their liberty.</P>
<P>When the king was a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le
of Wight, none was more forward in rai&s;ing
an army for his relief than &s;ir Archibald; and
after the murder of his royal ma&s;ter, he &s;till
per&s;i&s;ted in his loyalty, and accompanied king
Charles II. into England, where he was created
a baronet by a royal patent, dated at the camp
of Woodhou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Ro&s;eberry.</NOTE> 1&s;t Augu&s;t 1651; the pre|amble
whereof runs thus: <Q REND="inline">"In con&s;idera|tion

performed to us, and our royal father of
ble&s;&s;ed memory, in our mo&s;t &s;pecial affairs,
by &s;ir Archibald Primro&s;e, clerk to our
privy council; and being de&s;irous to grati|fy
the de&s;ervings of &s;o faithful a &s;ervant
with &s;ome &s;pecial mark of our royal fa|vour,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After the unfortunate battle of Worce&s;ter,
&s;ir Archibald's e&s;tate was &s;eque&s;trated, and he
&s;uffered many other hard&s;hips during the u|&s;urpation,
all which he bore with great firm|ne&s;s
and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>King Charles II. was not forgetful of his
faithful &s;ervices; but, immediately after the
re&s;toration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> begun to reward him according to
his great merit. He was made lord regi&s;ter
for Scotland in Augu&s;t 1660, and one of the
&s;enators of the college of ju&s;tice, under the
title of lord Carrington, in which office he
acquitted him&s;elf with great probity, judg|ment,
and candour, for a con&s;iderable number
of years.</P>
<P>And as he was a true patriot, and had no|thing
&s;o much at heart as the intere&s;t of his
country, he often oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of the
court, when he thought they were acting
contrary to it, and joined tho&s;e lords who
were for the redre&s;s of grievances; for which
he, with the duke of Hamilton, the earls of
Dumfries and Kincardin, the lord Cochran,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were turned out of the council.</P>
<P>But the king was &s;o much convinced of
his loyalty and fidelity, that for a long time
he could not be prevailed upon to deprive him
of the regi&s;ter's place; till at la&s;t, &s;ir Archibald
being old and infirm, the king appointed &s;ir
George MacKenzie of Tarbet lord regi&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Ro&s;eberry.</NOTE>
and at the &s;ame time to &s;hew the real e&s;teem
and regard he had for &s;ir Archibald, made him
ju&s;tice-general in October 1678.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the memoirs of this great
man, with a letter written to him by the earl
of Clarendon, when chancellor of England,
in the&s;e words:</P>
<Q><P>"I cannot, my lord, but congratulate you
for the meritorious part you had in re&s;tor|ing
his maje&s;ty, and the kingdom of Scot|land,

<P>THE traditional accounts of the origin
of this mo&s;t noble and antient family
are various. Some authors are of opinion,
that the &s;irname is local, and was a&s;&s;umed by
the proprietors of the lands and barony of
Le&s;lyn, in Aberdeen-&s;hire, as &s;oon as &s;irnames
began to be u&s;ed in this country.</P>
<P>Others alledge, that one Bartholomew de
Le&s;lyn, a noble Hungarian, came to Scotland
with queen Margaret about the year 1067:
that he was the &s;on of Walter de Le&s;lyn, who
had a&s;&s;umed his &s;irname from the ca&s;tle of
Le&s;lyn in Hungary, where he was born, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Robert Sibbald, Mr. Martin of Cler|mont,
and other learned antiquaries, deduce
their de&s;cent from that</P>
<P>Bartholomew, who, being in great favour
with king Malcolm Canmore, obtained from
that prince grants of &s;everal lands in Aber|deen-&s;hire,
which he called Le&s;lyn, after his
own &s;irname: that he died in the beginning
of the reign of king David I. leaving i&s;&s;ue a
&s;on,</P>
<P>Malcolm de Le&s;lyn, who &s;ucceeded him,
and was progenitor of all the Le&s;lies in Scot|land.</P>
<P>No Scotch &s;irname has made a greater fi|gure
in Europe than that of Le&s;lie. We have
now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in Scotland four peers of that
name. There were at one time three gene|ral
officers of this name to three &s;everal crown|ed
heads, <HI>viz.</HI> Count Walter Le&s;lie to the
emperor of Germany, Alexander earl of Le|ven
to king Charles I. of Britain, and David
(afterwards lord Newark) to Gu&s;tavus Adol|phus
king of Sweden.</P>
<P>There are at this time &s;everal counts of
this name in Germany, be&s;ides many con&s;ide|rable
families in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bayle's dicti|onary, &amp;c.</NOTE> Mu&s;covy, Poland;
and one of the &s;ame name governed the king|dom
of Hungary as the emperor's vice-roy,
who&s;e daughter he had the honour to marry.</P>
<P>We now proceed to deduce the de&s;cent of
this illu&s;trious family by unque&s;tionable au|thority.</P>
<P>I. BARTHOLF, or BARTHOLOMEW de
LESLYN, was proprietor of the lands and ba|rony
of Le&s;lyn, in Aberdeen-&s;hire, in the reign
of king William the Lion, who &s;ucceeded to
the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165, and died
in 1214.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>II. MALCOLM de LESLYN, who obtain|ed
from David earl of Huntington, the king's
brother, a new grant of the lands of Le&s;lyn
in Garioch, which belonged to his father Bar|tholf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta pene comitem de Rothes.</NOTE>

<HEAD>DUKE of ROTHSAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t who enjoyed the title of duke
in this kingdom, was David, prince of
Scotland, elde&s;t &s;on of king Robert III. by
queen Aunabella Drummond. He was born
<HI>anno</HI> 1378, and created duke of Roth&s;ay, earl
of Athole and Carrick, <HI>anno</HI> 1398.</P>
<P>He was a youth of great re&s;olution and in|trepidity.
He held out the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh
again&s;t a royal army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of the royal family, p. 162.</NOTE> commanded by
king Henry IV. of England.</P>
<P>He challenged king Henry to fight him,
with three or four, or a hundred nobles on
each &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to &s;ave the blood of his &s;ubjects, but
the challenge was not accepted.</P>
<P>He married lady Marjory Douglas, daugh|ter
of Archibald third earl of Douglas, and
lord of Galloway, but by her he had no i&s;|&s;ue.</P>
<P>Though this prince wanted neither parts
nor &s;pirits, yet it is certain he gave him&s;elf
too much up to a voluptuous life, which gave
his old and virtuous father great vexation.
He therefore ordered him to be confined in the
palace of Falkland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winton, extract. e chron. Scotiae, &amp;c.</NOTE> and narrowly looked af|ter
by &s;ome particular friends, where accord|ing
to the be&s;t and cotemporary authors, he
died of a dy&s;entery, <HI>anno</HI> 1401.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible it has been alledged, that
this prince was &s;tarved to death by the duke
of Albany's means; but as there is good rea|&s;on
to believe, that that calumny was rai&s;ed
by the earl of Athole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruddiman's notes on Buchanan.</NOTE> on purpo&s;e to a&s;per&s;e
the duke of Albany, and as it is certain the
earl of Douglas, then one of the greate&s;t
men in the kingdom, and brother-in-law to
the duke of Roth&s;ay never re&s;ented it, we
think we have followed the be&s;t authority.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince this duke's death, the elde&s;t &s;on
of the king of Scotland, is born duke of Roth|&s;ay,
earl of Carrick, and lord of Renfrew,

<HEAD>KER Duke of ROXBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;irname of Ker or Car is of great
antiquity in Scotland, and &s;ome are of
opinion that they came originally to this i&s;|land
from France, where there were &s;everal
con&s;iderable families, who made a great figure,
even before the tenth century, and who&s;e po|&s;terity
are &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in that kingdom to this
day.</P>
<P>That one of the&s;e, a man of rank and &s;pi|rit,
came over to England with William the
Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, had a con&s;iderable
command in his army, and having remarkably
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for courage and conduct,
got from that great prince a large &s;hare of the
conquered lands, particularly in the north of
England, where his po&s;terity &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and
that of him all the Kers in Great Britain are
de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the armorial bearing of the
Kers in England and France are the very
&s;ame: But at what time the Kers &s;ettled fir&s;t
in Scotland, or whether they came from Eng|land
or France, cannot now be po&s;itively a&s;|certained:
yet it appears from good authori|ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col|lect. Rymer's foed. Aug. &amp;c.</NOTE>
that there were &s;everal families of that &s;ir|name
in the we&s;t of Scotland, in the reign of

<P>Sir George MacKenzie, that learned anti|quary,

<HEAD>RUTHERFOORD Lord RUTHERFOORD.</HEAD>
<P>THE traditional account of the origin of
this mo&s;t ancient family is, that a man of
di&s;tinction, on the borders, having conducted
Ruther king of the Scots &s;afely through the ri|ver
Tweed, in an expedition again&s;t the Britons,
at a place from that event called Rutherfoord,
the king, after the expedition was over, be|&s;towed
&s;ome lands, contiguous thereto, upon
his faithful conducter, from which his po&s;te|rity
a&s;&s;umed the name of Ruther-foord, as
&s;oon as &s;irnames became hereditary in Scotland.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the Rutherfoords have always
been looked upon among&s;t the mo&s;t antient
and mo&s;t powerful families on the borders;
were a race of brave and gallant men, who,
on many occa&s;ions, &s;ignalized them&s;elves, and
fought valiantly again&s;t their enemies, in de|fence
of the liberties of their country.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal con&s;iderable families of
this &s;irname in the &s;outh of Scotland, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Rutherfoords of that ilk, of Hunthill, of Ed|zer&s;ton,
of Hundelie, of Nisbet, of Fairny|toun,
of Fernelie, of Capehope, and many o|thers;
but the fir&s;t of them we have found
upon record, is,</P>
<P>I. HUGO de RUTHERFOORD, who is wit|ne&s;s
in a grant by Philip de Valoniis, of the
lands of Terpenhow, in Northumberland, to

<P>He was father of,</P>

<P>IV. ELIZABETH, &s;econd daughter of Tho|mas

<P>The patent was accidentally burnt with the
hou&s;e of Freeland &s;ome years ago, and is
not upon record; but if the honours were to
the heirs general of the patentee's body, this
lord's title to the peerage is indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in the year
1706, when the roll of the Scotch peers was
adju&s;ted for the union parliament, the lord
Ruthven was continued on the roll, though
the male line of the fir&s;t lord was extinct
&s;ome years before. He was ranked, accord|ing
to his creation, immediately after the lord
Colvile, and before lord Rutherfoord; and
by the articles of the union this was to be
the e&s;tabli&s;hed and fixed roll <HI>in futuram rei

<P>In the year 1739, when the hou&s;e of peers
gave an order to the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion to make
a particular enquiry into the titles of the
Scotch peerage, the roll of 1706 was their
rule; and they found the titles of no le&s;s than
twenty-five peers of that roll dubious:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Report of the lords of &s;e&s;&s;i|on to the H. of peers, printed in 1740.</NOTE> the

<P>AS the origin of the great and illu&s;trious
name of Fra&s;er is fully &s;et forth, page
427th of this work, under the title lord Lo|vat,
we proceed to deduce the de&s;cent of this
noble family from,</P>
<P>Sir Alexander Fra&s;er, &s;econd &s;on of &s;ir Si|mon
of Oliver-ca&s;tle, and brother of that he|ro
and patriot &s;ir Simon, who had &s;o great a
&s;hare of the glory acquired by the Scots near
Ro&s;lin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi&s;torians.</NOTE> where they defeated three Engli&s;h ar|mies
in one day, in the year 1303.</P>
<P>This &s;ir Alexander was one of the greate&s;t
men of his time, was lord high chamberlain
of Scotland in the reign of king Robert Bruce,
and married lady Mary, &s;i&s;ter of that great
prince, by whom he had five &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> his heir, who died without
male-i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The other &s;our &s;ons were &s;ir <HI>William, Si|mon,
James</HI> and <HI>Andrew. Vide</HI> page 429th.</P>
<P>The undoubted ance&s;tor of this noble fa|mily
was,</P>
<P>I. Sir WILLIAM, &s;on of the above &s;ir A|lexander,
who obtained from his father the
thanedom of Cowie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and lands of A&s;&s;entully,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were confirmed to him by a char|ter
from king David Bruce.</P>
<P>He al&s;o got from the &s;ame prince, a confir|mation-charter
of the lands of Dores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and o|thers,
which were the property of his father.</P>

we refer our readers, yet we &s;hall here, by
authentic vouchers, briefly deduce their de|&s;cent,
with the mo&s;t remarkable occurrences
that happened in the family.</P>
<P>This &s;ir William was a man of great ho|nour
and loyalty, and performed many brave
actions in defence of the liberties of his
country, in the minority of his cou&s;in king
David Bruce, with whom he was afterwards
in great favour.</P>
<P>He accompanied him in his unfortunate ex|pedition
into England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 343.</NOTE> where he lo&s;t his life,
and his royal ma&s;ter was taken pri&s;oner at the

<HEAD>MACKENZIE Earl of SEAFORTH.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our hi&s;torians agree, that the imme|diate
ance&s;tor of this illu&s;trious family
was from Ireland, being a &s;on of the Geralds
or Fitzgerald, earls of De&s;monds, Kildare,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and power|ful
families in that kingdom.</P>
<P>He was called Calinus, and, upon &s;ome di&s;|content,
having left his own country, came to
Scotland about the year 1261, with a con&s;i|derable
number of his friends and followers.
He and his retinue were kindly received by
king Alexander III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac|Kenzie, Aber|crombie, Crawfurd, &amp;c.</NOTE> and he &s;erved him faith|ully
as long as he lived.</P>
<P>About two years after his arrival, Haco king
of Norway invaded Scotland with a powerful
fleet and army, with which he landed in the
&s;hire of Air.</P>
<P>King Alexander immediately marched
again&s;t him, and was joined by this brave
&s;tranger and his followers: they &s;oon came
to an engagement, and king Alexander obtain|ed
a complete victory over king Haco at Largis
in Cunningham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi|&s;torians.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1263.</P>
<P>In this action the gallant Calinus acquired
great glory and reputation, by his conduct
and intrepidity, and became a mighty favour|ite
of king Alexander, who, to encourage
him to &s;ettle in Scotland, naturalized him;
and in reward of his great merit and faithful
&s;ervices (as the charter bears) made him a
grant of the whole lands of Kintail in Inver|ne&s;s-&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv. familiae de Seaforth.</NOTE>
erected into a free barony to him
and his heirs for ever, by his royal charter,
dated 9th January 1266. From him there|fore
we proceed to deduce the de&s;cent of this
noble family.</P>
<P>I. CALINUS or CALIN, fir&s;t baron of
Kintail, having been naturalized by king A|lexander
III. as before ob&s;erved, was much
about that prince's court; and having, at a
hunting match, with an arrow, killed a &s;tag,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac|Kenzie's hi&s;t. of this fami|ly, p. 31.</NOTE> in full career, was making towards the
king; his maje&s;ty, on that account, a&s;&s;igned
ed him a &s;tag's head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for his armorial
bearing.</P>
<P>He was a man of good parts, and took great
pains to make him&s;elf agreeable to the inha|bitants
of that part of the country where he
re&s;ided, and became greatly beloved and e|&s;teemed.</P>
<P>According to doctor George MacKenzie,
who has wrote a full and elaborate hi&s;tory of
this noble family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. I. p. 32.</NOTE> he married a daughter of
Walter lord high &s;teward of Scotland, by
whom he had a &s;on,</P>
<P><HI>Kenneth,</HI> who &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>He died at his ca&s;tle of I&s;land-Donan, and
was buried in the famous mona&s;tery of Icolm|kill,
<HI>anno</HI> 1278.</P>
<P>II. KENNETH, &s;econd baron of Kintail,
being a man of great affability and benevo|lence,
became very popular in the northern
parts; but what part he acted during the di&s;|putes
betwixt the Bruce and the Baliol, our
hi&s;torians are &s;ilent.</P>
<P>He married Morba MacDowal, daughter
of Alexander lord of Lorn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and dying <HI>anno</HI>

<P>III. KENNETH, third baron of Kintail, who
in the Galic (the language then u&s;ed) was
called Kenneth MacKenneth, or the &s;on of
Kenneth. This in Engli&s;h came to be call|ed
MacKenny or MacKenzie, and from him
all the MacKenzies in Scotland are de&s;cended.</P>
<P>He was a great loyali&s;t, and a firm friend
of king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>He was very a&s;&s;i&s;ting to him when he was
in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, before he was &s;ettled
on the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac|Kenzie's hi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> vol. I.</NOTE> and behaved gallantly at the
memorable battle of Bannockburn, in 1314.</P>
<P>He died in the year 1328, having marri|ed
Margaret, daughter of David de Strabolgie,
earl of Athol, and niece of John Cumin lord
of Badenoch, by whom he had a &s;on,</P>

<P>AS the origin of the great and illu&s;trious
name of Sinclair, is to be found under
the title of Sinclair earl of Orkney, page
529th of this work, we proceed to deduce
the de&s;cent of this noble family from their
immediate ance&s;tor,</P>
<P>William third earl of Orkney, who was
al&s;o earl of Caithne&s;s. He lived in the reigns
of king James I. II. and III. and had to his
fir&s;t wife lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of
Archibald fourth earl of Douglas, by lady
Margaret Stewart, daughter of king Robert

<P>Though he did not &s;ucceed to his father in
his titles of honour, yet we have undoubt|ed
proof of his being his elde&s;t &s;on, and he
certainly obtained con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in

<HEAD>SOMERVILLE Lord SOMERVILLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Somervilles are of Norman extrac|tion,
and came over to Britain with
William the Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066.</P>
<P>The rank they bore in Normandy intitled
them to the highe&s;t regard of their prince;
the con&s;iderable commands they had in the
army, and their gallant behaviour in England,
gave them a ju&s;t claim to a &s;hare of the con|que&s;ts
of that country; and accordingly,</P>
<P>I. Sir GUALTER, or WALTER de SO|MERVILLE,
obtained from the Conqueror,
<PB N="624" REF="657">
(having been one of his chief commanders)
the whole lord&s;hip and territory of Whitch|nour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roll of Battle Abbay, du Moulin's hi&s;t. of Normandy, and Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE>
in the county of Stafford, where he &s;et|tled,
as al&s;o Somerville A&s;ton in Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire.
He was progenitor of all the Somer|villes
in Great Britain.</P>
<P>He lived after the year 1100, and left i&s;&s;ue
&s;everal &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Walter de Somerville,</HI> who &s;ucceed|ed
him in the lord&s;hip of Whitchnour, and
carried on the line of that great and opulent
family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba|ronage.</NOTE> which flouri&s;hed with lu&s;tre in England
for many ages. He lived in the reigns of
king Henry I. and king Stephen, and of him
was lineally de&s;cended &s;ir Philip de Somerville,
lord of Whitchnour, who made a con&s;iderable
figure in the reigns of kings Henry IV. and V.
and was &s;o famous for his great ho&s;pitality, that
he is recorded for having given a flitch of ba|con
as a reward to any husband and wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Addi&s;on's works.</NOTE> who
could &s;ay that they never had the lea&s;t diffe|rence,
nor contradicted one another within
the &s;pace of twelve months after marriage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The figure of a flitch of bacon, neatly
carved on wood, is at this day in Whitchnour
hou&s;e, near Litchfield, now the &s;eat of&mdash;
Offby, E&s;q; but the male line of the Whitch|nour
family is long &s;ince extinct, having end|ed
in a &s;ingle daughter, married to the great
Stafford duke of Buckingham, con&s;table of
England, forfeited and beheaded in Henry the
VIII's time.</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1625, and by the &s;aid Janet,

he left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, &s;eventh baron, afterwards
vi&s;count Stair, born 1619, who &s;tudied at the
college of Gla&s;gow was a fine &s;cholar, and
pa&s;&s;ed all the regular degrees of learning at
that univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>When the civil war broke out in the reign
of king Charles I. he accepted of a captain's
commi&s;&s;ion from the parliament in the earl of
Glencairn's regiment; but it does not appear
that he did any thing remarkable in that &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>He was a man of great parts and know|ledge,
applied him&s;elf chiefly to the &s;tudy of
the laws, and became mo&s;t eminent in that
profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the year 1649, when the e&s;tates of the
nation &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners to Breda, to invite
king Charles II. to come to Scotland, and
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ju&s;t right, the baron of
Stair was appointed &s;ecretary to that emba&s;|&s;y,
and acquitted him&s;elf &s;o much to his ma|je&s;ty's
&s;atisfaction, that he held him in high
e&s;teem ever after.</P>
<P>He arrived in Scotland with the commi&s;|&s;ioners,
before the king; and upon his maje|&s;ty's
landing in 1650, he immediately waited
upon him, was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly received, and
contributed all that lay in his power to rai&s;e
forces for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, which, after
the fatal battle or Worce&s;ter, were di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The baron of Stair continued his practice
at the bar with great reputation; but never
could be prevailed on to take any oaths to
the goverment during the u&s;urpation, though
he had great offers made him.</P>
<P>As the brevity of this work will not per|mit
us to give a full account of all the tran&s;|actions
of this great man's life, we &s;hall on|ly
briefly mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t remark|able
occurences, and refer our readers to Mr.
Crawfurd's peerage, page 453, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the re&s;toration of king Charles II.
he went to London with the earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis,
a great loyali&s;t, to congratulate his maje&s;ty
upon that happy event. The king, having
a great opinion of his abilities, fir&s;t conferred
the honour of knighthood upon him, then
appointed him one of the &s;enators of the col|lege
of ju&s;tice in the beginning of 1661;
and in November thereafter, upon &s;ir John
Gilmour the lord pre&s;ident's being called up
to London, he was con&s;tituted vice-pre&s;ident
during his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>In the year 1664, the king, as a further
mark of his royal favour, created him a knight
baronet, by patent to him and the heirs-male
of his body for ever.</P>
<P>He afterwards got a charter under the great
&s;eal, <HI>domino Johanni Dalrymple de Stair, mi|liti
baronetto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> of the lands and barony of
Stair, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> dated the 15th day of Febru|ary
1669.</P>
<P>In the year 1671, he was appointed lord
pre&s;ident of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, in which high office
he di&s;charged his duty with great &s;ufficiency,
knowledge, and integrity.</P>
<P>As the lord pre&s;ident did not approve of
all the mea&s;ures of the court towards the end
of king Charles II.'s reign, he &s;poke his mind
very freely in parliament; and having ma|ny
enemies in the mini&s;try, was removed
from all his offices, <HI>anno</HI> 1682. He thereup|on
retired to Holland, where he remained till
the year 1688, when he came over with the
prince of Orange, with whom he was in great
favour; and who was no &s;ooner &s;ettled on the
throne, than he re&s;tored him to his office of
lord pre&s;ident of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>anno</HI> 1689, and
rai&s;ed him to the dignity of the peerage, by
the title of vi&s;count Stair, lord Glenluce and
Stranrawer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> cellaria.</NOTE> by patent to him and the heirs|male
of his body, dated at Ken&s;ington, 1&s;t

<P>He married Margaret, daughter of James
Ro&s;s of Balneil, by whom he got a great ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to his e&s;tate in lands; and in con&s;e|quence
thereof the family ever &s;ince continu|ed
to quarter the arms of Ro&s;s with their
own. By her he had i&s;&s;ue five &s;ons, and four
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> afterwards earl of Stair.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>James Dalrymple</HI> of Borthwick, ba|ronet,
one of the principal clerks of &s;e&s;&s;ion, a
man of great merit, learning, and knowledge,
and one of the be&s;t antiquaries of his time,

<P>3. Sir <HI>Hugh Dalrymple</HI> of North-Berwick,

in our laws, and was long lord pre&s;ident of

<P>5. Sir <HI>David Dalrymple</HI> of Hailes, Bart. al&s;o
an eminent lawier, who was lord advocate in
the reigns of queen Anne, and king George I.
He al&s;o married and had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>1&s;t daughter, <HI>Janet,</HI> married to David, &s;on

<P>3. <HI>Sarah,</HI> married to Charles lord Crich|ton,

Dumfries.</P>
<P>4. <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> married to &s;ir David Cunning|ham
of Millcraig, Bart. The la&s;t three had i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The vi&s;count died in the 76th year of his
age, <HI>anno</HI> 1695, and was &s;ucceeded by his el|de&s;t
&s;on,</P>
<P>XIII. JOHN, &s;econd vi&s;count Stair, who
was al&s;o bred to the law, and acquired great
knowledge in that profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was a man of fine parts, and great abi|lities,
was appointed advocate by king James
VII. <HI>anno</HI> 1686, and afterwards lord ju&s;tice-clerk
by the &s;ame prince.</P>
<P>He went early and mo&s;t zealou&s;ly into the
revolution, and at the convention of e&s;tates in
1689, he expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire that a trea|ty
of union might be &s;et on foot between the
two nations, which afterwards he had a great
hand in accompli&s;hing; and as he had been
very in&s;trumental in getting the crown de|clared
vacant by the convention, he was one
of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to make an of|fer
thereof to the prince and prince&s;s of O|range,
in the &s;ame year, 1689.</P>
<P>He was, by their maje&s;ties, appointed lord
advocate for Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1690; and the
year thereafter was con&s;tituted one of the
principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. As the ma&s;&s;acre
of Glencoe happened while he was in that of|fice,
the parliament begun to make &s;ome en|quiry
into the authors of it, in the year 1695;
and no doubt he was able to ju&s;tify him&s;elf:
for as the orders for that bloody tragedy were
generally believed to have proceeded from a
higher power, the affair was immediately
dropped; but the &s;ecretary was laid a&s;ide for
the time.</P>
<P>Upon queen Anne's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,
he was nominated one of her privy council;
and, as a te&s;timony of her maje&s;ty's favour
and e&s;teem, he was further dignified with the
titles of earl of Stair, vi&s;count Dalrymple,
lord Newli&s;ton, Glenluce, and Stranrawer, by
patent to the heirs-male of his body; which
failing, to the heirs-male of the body of the
decea&s;t James vi&s;count Stair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in cancellaria.</NOTE> his father, dated
8th April 1703.</P>
<P>He was named one of the commi&s;&s;ioners
for the treaty of union, of which he was a
mo&s;t &s;incere and &s;ervent promoter; but he
died of an apoplexy ju&s;t before it was com|pleated,
on 8th January 1706-7, in the 59th
year of his age.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter and heire&s;s
of &s;ir John Dundas of Newli&s;ton, in con&s;e|quence
whereof he quartered the arms of
Dundas with his own, and by her had i&s;&s;ue
three &s;ons, and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Colonel <HI>William Dalrymple</HI> of Glen|mure,
of whom more afterwards.</P>
<P>3. <HI>George,</HI> one of the barons of exchequer,
who married a daughter of &s;ir Andrew Myr|ton
of Gogar; and dying <HI>anno</HI> 1745, left i&s;&s;ue
a &s;on, captain John Dalrymple, who married
mi&s;s Middleton.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Margaret Dalrymple;</HI>
was married to Hugh third earl of Loudoun.</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN, &s;econd earl of Stair, &s;ucceed|ed
his father in January 1707, and was in
his &s;tead appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners
to fini&s;h the treaty of union betwixt the two
nations.</P>
<P>He had a liberal education, was a man of
great integrity, and good parts, both natural
and acquired.</P>
<P>He gave early proofs of his having an ex|traordinary
military genius. In 1702, he was
appointed lieutenant-colonel to the third re|giment
of guards, and &s;erved as a volunteer
in Flanders, under the duke of Marlborough,
where he remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf,
particularly at the taking of Venlo and Liege.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he was made aide-de-camp
to that great general; and colonel of the royal
Scotch dragoons.</P>
<P>He commanded a brigade of &s;oot at the
battle of Ramellies. In 1706, he was made
a brigadier, and &s;erved in that po&s;t at the
battle of Audenard, and brought the news of
that victory to England, <HI>anno</HI> 1708.</P>
<P>He was elected one of the &s;ixteen Scotch
peers to the fir&s;t parliament of Great-Britain,
and was re-elected to the fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;e|venth.</P>
<P>In 1709, he commanded as a major-gene|ral
at the taking of Tanier, and as a lieute|nant-general
at the taking of Doway, <HI>anno</HI>
1710, in which year he was, by a &s;pecial or|der
from queen Anne, inve&s;ted with the mo&s;t
noble order of the thi&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the end of the queen's reign, he not
coming into the mea&s;ures of the court, was
laid a&s;ide, and &s;old his regiment to the earl of
Portmore; but upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king
George I. to the throne, he was named one
of his privy council, was appointed one of
the lords of his bed-chamber, and was re&s;tor|ed
to his regiment of dragoons.</P>
<P>And being no le&s;s an able &s;tate&s;man than a
good &s;oldier, he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador extraor|dinary
to the court of France, upon a negoti|ation
<PB N="640" REF="673">
of the highe&s;t importance. He made
his public entry in January 1718, and per|formed
the bu&s;ine&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y with great
dexterity and honour. In the year 1733, he
re&s;igned all his offices, and retired from pu|blic
bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>Iu 1741, he was made a field mari&s;hal of
the forces, and &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to the &s;tates
general. He had the government of Minor|ca,
and was commander in chief of the allied
army, <HI>anno</HI> 1743, till his maje&s;ty took the
command at the battle of Dettingen.</P>
<P>In 1745, he had a third time the com|mand
of the royal Scotch dragoons.</P>
<P>He married lady Eleanor Campbell, daugh|ter
of James &s;econd earl of Loudoun, dow|ager
of James vi&s;count Primro&s;e; but died
without i&s;&s;ue, <HI>anno</HI> 1747.</P>
<P>Sometime before his death, he a&s;&s;igned his
e&s;tate and honours (which he thought he had
a right to do by the patent) to John, &s;on of
his younge&s;t brother George the baron, in
prejudice of the &s;ons of colonel William, the
elde&s;t brother; but the &s;ame being conte&s;ted
in the hou&s;e of lords, the honours were ad|judged
to James, &s;on of the &s;aid colonel Wil|liam,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XIV. Colonel WILLIAM DALRYMPLE
of Glenmure, &s;econd &s;on of John fir&s;t earl of

the &s;econd earl, married Penelope counte&s;s of

<P>IV. Sir DAVID MURRAY of Go&s;pitrie,
<PB N="646" REF="679">
&s;econd &s;on of &s;ir Andrew Murray of Arngosk
and Balvaird, who, from his youth, was bred
at the court of king James VI. and being a
man of extraordinary parts, great honour, and
integrity, was highly e&s;teemed by his maje|&s;ty,
who fir&s;t made him his cup-bearer; then
ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and captain of the guard;
and having conferred on him the honour of
knighthood, made him comptroller of the
royal revenue, upon the removal of &s;ir David
Home of Wedderburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. penes vice|com. de Stor|mont.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1599; in which
offices he &s;erved his maje&s;ty with great fide|lity
and loyalty.</P>
<P>He attended the court from Falkland to
Perth, on the memorable 5th of Augu&s;t 1600,
when the earl of Gowrie and his brother
made that audacious attempt upon his maje|&s;ty's
&s;acred per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of Gowry's con|&s;piracy.</NOTE> where he was greatly in|&s;trumental
in &s;aving the king's life.</P>
<P>He did another remarkable piece of &s;ervice
to the court at this juncture; for after the
earl of Gowrie, then provo&s;t of Perth, was
killed, the whole town was in an uproar, and
heavily threatened the authors of his death;
but &s;ir David, by his great prudence and re|&s;olute
conduct, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his young
cou&s;in William &s;econd earl of Tullibardine,
quelled the tumult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and conducted the king
and court &s;afe back to Falkland.</P>
<P>For which good &s;ervices, he was ever after
among&s;t the fir&s;t favourites of the king, who
thought he could never be&s;tow too much
upon &s;o good and faithful a &s;ubject and &s;ervant.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t gave him the barony of Ruthven,
the chief &s;eat of the Gowrie family, which
came to the crown by the earl's forfeiture,
and was afterwards called Huntingtower.
Soon thereafter he be&s;towed upon him the
lands of the whole abbay of Scoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et pe|nes vicecom. de Stormont.</NOTE> of which
the earl of Gowrie had been commendator,
erected it into a temporal lord&s;hip, to be cal|led
the lord&s;hip of Scoon, with a &s;eat and
vote in parliament; and he was therein, with
the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, inve&s;ted, 7th April
1605, by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, directed to
the earl of Dunfermline, then chancellor for
that effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workman's M. S. a herald who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the inve&s;ti|ture.</NOTE> the earls of Angus, Sutherland,

to the ceremony; which erection was con|firmed
to the lord Scoon by a &s;pecial act of
parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1606; about which time he
had the office of ranger of the Lummonds,
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ore&s;try of the woods, and the old ca&s;tle-&s;tead
of Falkland conferred upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes vicecom&punc; de Stormont.</NOTE> with
&s;everal other beneficial grants.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter, he made a &s;ettle|ment
of his e&s;tate and honours, which was
ratified and confirmed by a charter from king
James VI. under his own hand, in the&s;e terms:</P>

and &s;teady re&s;olution, was appoint|ed
his maje&s;ty's high commi&s;&s;ioner to &s;everal
general a&s;&s;emblies of the church, where he

<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>VI. MALISE, &s;ixth earl of Strathern, al&s;o

<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his only &s;on,</P>
<P>VII. MALISE, &s;eventh earl of Strathern,
a worthy patriot, a &s;teady loyali&s;t, and always
unvariably attached to the intere&s;t of his king

<P>During the minority of king David Bruce,
he oppo&s;ed Edward Baliol with all his inte|re&s;t;
wherefore, when that prince prevailed,
he was by him forfeited, and his earldom of
Strathern given to an Engli&s;h lord, John de
Warren earl of Surrey, cou&s;in to king Ed|ward
III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IV. p. 595.</NOTE> in compen&s;ation <HI>&s;umptum et labo|rum

<P>Earl Mali&s;e u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to recover
his e&s;tate, by the influence of his friends with

king Edward III. of England wrote
two letters to Baliol in favours of his cou&s;in
the earl of Surrey, dated al&s;o in March 1334.
Immediately thereafter, we find this John de
Warren de&s;igned <HI>comes Surriae et de Strathern,</HI>

renounces and &s;urrenders to king Edward

<P>As there were &s;everal great and flouri&s;hing

<P>After MacBeth had murdered king Dun|can,
he greatly dreaded the power of the
thane of Sutherland. He knew he was a great
patriot, and had been very active in keeping
up the &s;pirits of the loyali&s;ts in favours of
prince Malcolm, the rightful heir of the
crown: he therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ound means to get
him put to death al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> a little before the re|&s;toration
of king Malcolm.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>WALTER, thane of Sutherland, who, in
reward of his father's faithful &s;ervices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gord. Home, Buchanan, Crawf. &amp;c.</NOTE> and
great &s;ufferings, and his own merit, was cre|ated
earl of Sutherland by king Malcolm III.
in the very beginning of his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1057,
and was one of the fir&s;t in the kingdom who
enjoyed that dignity.</P>
<P>He died in 1097, leaving i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>ROBERT, &s;econd earl of Sutherland, who
&s;ucceeded him, and flouri&s;hed in the reign of
king Alexander I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>He built the ca&s;tle of Dunrobin, which
hath ever &s;ince been one of the chief &s;eats of
the family.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>HUGH FRISKIN, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> Thus our
authors have accounted for the fir&s;t earls of
Sutherland.</P>
<P>This Hugh was indeed the real and un|doubted
progenitor of this noble family, but
was not the &s;on of Robert, which will appear
from unque&s;tionable authority.</P>
<P>He was the &s;on of Friskin or Friskinus, who
was proprietor of all tho&s;e Northern countries.</P>
<P>Whether this Friskin was brother or cou|&s;in
to Robert &s;econd earl of Sutherland, we
cannot pretend to determine, but from him
we proceed to deduce the de&s;cent of this mo&s;t
ancient family, by indi&s;putable documents.</P>
<P>I. FRISKINUS, who, it is &s;aid, had that
name put upon him by his being a great war|rior;
Friskin, in the old language, &s;ignifying
the man with the ready hanger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was one of the greate&s;t men in the
kingdom, had va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in lands in the
counties of Murray, Ro&s;s, Sutherland, and
Caithne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he divided among&s;t his
children, who&s;e po&s;terity a&s;&s;umed their &s;ir|names
from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as was the cu|&s;tom
of tho&s;e early times.</P>
<P>To his &s;on <HI>William</HI> he gave a great e&s;tate
in Murray; the lands of Duffus, Ro&s;&s;ile, Inchi|kil,
Machir, Kintrai, and many others, all
mentioned in a charter of confirmation of
king William, in which are the&s;e remarkable

was third earl of Sutherland, but was only the
fir&s;t of this line.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o a gallant officer, and defeated
a con&s;iderable body of the Danes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gordon and Crawfurd.</NOTE> and &s;lew
their general at Embo in Sutherland, in the
end of the reign of king William the Lyon.</P>
<P>He made a donation to Gilbert archdeacon
of Murray (afterwards St. Gilbert) of the
lands of Skelbo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comit. de Su|therland.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Sutherland, confirm|ed
by a charter under the great &s;eal from king
William, which is &s;till extant.</P>
<P>He died in the beginning of the reign of
king Alexander II. who &s;ucceeded king Wil|liam,
<HI>anno</HI> 1214, and left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>III. WILLIAM, &s;econd earl of Sutherland,
who &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>He confirmed his father's donation of the
lands of Skelbo to St. Gilbert, and built the ca|thedral
church of Dornock in Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Su|therland.</NOTE> and
called it St. Gilbert's church: the &s;outh-i&s;le
whereof hath been the burial place of the fa|mily
ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>This noble earl had al&s;o &s;everal encounters
with the Danes and Norvegians, who often
invaded that part of the country. He gain|ed
one remarkable victory over them in the
reign of king Alexander II. in memory
whereof, there was a cro&s;s erected, called

<P>IV. WILLIAM, third earl of Sutherland,
who was a man of great parts, a true patriot,
and no le&s;s a brave &s;oldier than an able &s;tate&s;|man.</P>
<P>There was a controver&s;y, which had long
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt the bi&s;hops of Caithne&s;s and
earls of Sutherland, about the lands of Skelbo,
Pron&s;ie, Thirbolt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was at la&s;t ami|cably

king Robert Bruce as &s;oon as he began to

many brave actions in defence of the

<P>As &s;ir James was the fir&s;t of this family

<P>Sir JAMES SANDILANDS, &s;econd &s;on of
&s;ir James of Calder, a man of great parts
and learning, who having, in the cour&s;e of
his travels, re&s;ided &s;ome time in the i&s;land of
Malta, he there gave &s;uch proofs of his great
capacity and univer&s;al knowledge, that upon
the death of &s;ir Walter Lind&s;ay, lord of St.
John, he was preferred by the knights of
Malta to the preceptory of Torphichen, the
chief re&s;idence of the knights of the order of
St. John of Jeru&s;alem and the temple of So|lomon,
in Scotland. He was received by the
grand prior of the ho&s;pital, with all the nece&s;&s;a|ry
forms, and was con&s;tituted chief or head
of that order, with the juri&s;diction of lord St.
John of Jeru&s;alem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and father Hay's vindication of Eliz. More.</NOTE> in Scotland, and got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the whole revenues of the precep|tory
of Torphichen, which then were very
con&s;iderable, <HI>anno</HI> 1543.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o a man of great honour and in|tegrity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
as well as of prudence and &s;agacity,
and was often employed in negotiations of im|portance,
both by king James V. and queen
Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and always acquitted him&s;elf with dex|terity
and reputation.</P>
<P>When the reformation was e&s;tabli&s;hed in
1560, the lord St. John embraced the prote|&s;tant
religion. He re&s;igned in the queen's
hands the whole preceptory of Torphichen,
and got that military benefice erected into a
temporal lord&s;hip, containing the baronies of
Torphichen, Li&s;ton, Balintrode, Tankerton,
Denny, Marycoulter, Stenhope, Galtna, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> lying within the &s;hires of Edinburgh,
Peebles, Linlithgow, Stirling, Lanark, Kin|cardin,

<P>We mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that both the bro|thers,

of the reformation; and it is report|ed,
that the fir&s;t prote&s;tant &s;acrament that was
admini&s;tred in Scotland, was by John Knox,

<P>I. JAMES STUART, &s;econd &s;on of James

<P>In that high &s;tation he a&s;&s;erted the king's

him guilty; but &s;ubmitted his puni&s;hment to

a&s;per&s;ed by the &s;actious party which then
prevailed, yet his royal ma&s;ter was always
convinced of his fidelity, and the uprightne&s;s

After the parliament pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon
him in 1641, his e&s;tate was &s;eque&s;trated, and
he was bani&s;hed his native country. He went
directly to the king, was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly re|ceived;
and the above letters &s;how, that he
was con&s;tantly tru&s;ted and employed by his
maje&s;ty ever after.</P>
<P>He was with the king at Oxford in 1644,
when the Scotch army was to march into Eng|land,
which they bound them&s;elves to do by
the &s;olemn league and covenant.</P>
<P>He was one of the few Scotch peers who
&s;igned a remon&s;trance again&s;t that conjuncti|on
of their countrymen with the parliament
at We&s;tmin&s;ter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth's collect. and Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE></P>
<P>He afterwards came to Scotland, but lived
retired till 1647.</P>
<P>He was then permitted to come to parlia|ment,
where he u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to get an
army rai&s;ed for the king's relief, then a pri|&s;oner
in the i&s;le of Wight. He levied a regi|ment
of hor&s;e upon his own charges, and,
with his &s;on the lord Linton, marched into
England, and fought on their head at the
battle of Pre&s;ton, <HI>anno</HI> 1648, where they
were both taken pri&s;oners. The lord Lin|ton
obtained his liberty &s;ome time thereafter,
but the old earl was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate, minutes of parliam. and re&s;cind. acts.</NOTE> by order of the Engli&s;h
parliament, confined in the ca&s;tle of Warwick
for four years, and the &s;eque&s;tration of his e|&s;tate
&s;till continued.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Oliver Cromwell, believing he
could do him no more harm, being denuded
and deprived of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, permitted
him to return to Scotland, where he led a
private life till he died.</P>
<P>This noble earl married lady Catharine

per&s;uaded William duke of Normandy to in|vade
England, before the year 1066.</P>
<P>In the li&s;t of the great captains that came
over from Normandy to England with that
heroic prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of Nor|mandy, vol. I. p. 201. and roll of Battle Abbay, &amp;c.</NOTE> le &s;ieur de la Haya is expre&s;s|ly
mentioned, with &s;everal others of the &s;ame
name; which plainly &s;hows, that they were a
numerous and flouri&s;hing family before the
conque&s;t.</P>
<P>That there were &s;everal religious hou&s;es
founded by them, appears from the &s;ame hi|&s;tory:
particularly le Abbay de Blancheland,
in the dioce&s;e of Conta&s;ines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;toire de Normandie.</NOTE> was founded and
endowed by Richard de la Haya in Norman|dy,
<HI>anno</HI> 1155.</P>
<P>That the Hays in Normandy had the &s;ame
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">morial bearings with the&s;e in Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Books of arms of old French families, pen. MacFarlane.</NOTE></P>
<P>And that for &s;ome generations after they
were &s;ettled in Scotland, many of them were
de&s;igned by the appellation of de la Haya: all
which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trong pre&s;umptive proofs, that

certain, that there are families of that &s;irname
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting in Normandy to this day, who de|duce
their pedigree above a hundred years
before the conque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="711">
As then there is clear proof, that &s;everal
of that name came to Britain in the year
1066; and as it appears, from our records,
that they were &s;ettled and making a figure
in Scotland within le&s;s than an hundred years
thereafter, it is extremely probable, that
&s;ome of that race came to Scotland with our
king David I. as it appears from all our hi&s;to|ries,
that &s;everal of Norman extraction, who
had contracted a friend&s;hip with that amiable
prince, when in England, came along with
him, and &s;ettled in this country, of whom
&s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable families in Scot|land
are de&s;cended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction to Fordun's hi&s;t. p. 60.</NOTE> &s;uch as Bruces, Maules,
Somervilles, Colviles, Normanviles, Montgo|meries,
Baliols, and many others.</P>
<P>'Tis hoped, therefore, that it reflects no
di&s;honour on this illu&s;trious family, to appear
to have &s;prung from a noble family in France,
who certainly &s;ettled in this i&s;land within le&s;s
than an hundred years after the battle of Lon|carty,
and were a great and flouri&s;hing fami|ly
in Normandy before it.</P>
<P>And as he fir&s;t of the family of Errol we
find upon record,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Scoon, Mur|ray, Cupar, St. Andrews, &amp;c.</NOTE> was William de la Haya,
who was &s;ettled in Perth&s;hire in the reigns of
king David I. and king Malcolm IV. &s;o there is
&s;ufficient proof, that William de la Haya,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle, Kel&s;o, Dun|fermline, &amp;c.</NOTE> an|ce&s;tor
of the family of Tweeddale, was &s;et|tled
in Lothian much about the &s;ame aera.</P>
<P>And as it does not appear from any
record, that they were of the &s;ame fami|ly,
it is highly probable, that the latter was a
&s;on or grand&s;on of one of tho&s;e great captains,
of the name of Hay, who came over to Eng|land
with William the Conqueror; and at|tending
king David into Scotland, &s;ettled in

<P>After the murder of the king, he continu|ed
with the loyal party, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the co|ronation
of king Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> at Scoon, <HI>anno</HI>
1651.</P>
<P>When the king marched into England, he
garri&s;oned his ca&s;tle of Niedpath for his ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ervice, which held out again&s;t Oliver
Cromwell longer than any place be&s;outh the
Forth.</P>
<P>Immediately after the re&s;toration, he got
charters under the great &s;eal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> of all his lands;
and king Charles II. as a reward of his loyal|ty
and fidelity, appointed him one of the
lords of his privy council, a commi&s;&s;ioner of
the trea&s;ury, and one of the extraordinary
lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion. In all which offices he con|tinued
till 1674, when he re&s;igned them, on
account of &s;ome differences between him and
the duke of Lauderdale, who&s;e daughter his
&s;on had married; but in 1682, he was again
re&s;tored to his employments in the council
and exchequer; in both which offices he con|tinued
till the end of the reign of king James
VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate, p. 238.</NOTE> who appointed him one of his privy coun|cil

<P>In the year 1686, finding him&s;elf greatly
oppre&s;&s;ed with debts, chiefly occa&s;ioned by
cautionry for the earl of Dunfermline, and
others, he &s;old his whole e&s;tate in Tweeddale,
to William duke of Queensberry, which he
gave to his &s;econd &s;on the earl of March.</P>
<P>The earl of Tweeddale came early into the

<P>AS the de&s;cent of the noble and illu&s;tri|ous
family of Wemy&s;s, from the anci|ent
earls of Fife, is in&s;tructed by charters in
our public records, and other authentic do|cuments,
&s;till pre&s;erved in the family, and
mentioned by &s;everal hi&s;torians, to the&s;e we
refer our readers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob Sib|bald's hi&s;t of Fife, &s;ir James Dalrymple's hi&s;t. collect appendix to Nisbet, 2dvol. Malcolm's hi&s;tory of the family, who had peru&s;ed all their writs, &amp;c.</NOTE> and &s;hall here only give a
brief account of the origin of their &s;irname,
which, like many others in this country, is
certainly local, and was fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed by the
proprietors of the lands (of old) called
Wemy&s;s-&s;hire, which contained all that tract
of ground lying betwixt the lower part of
the water of Ore and the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The&s;e lands got their name from the great
number of caves that are on them, all along
the &s;ea coa&s;t. A cave in the old Galic or
Celtic language was called Vumhs; from that
the&s;e lands got the name of Vams-&s;hire. In
proce&s;s of time they came to be called
Wemy&s;s-&s;hire; which name they &s;till retain,
as will appear from &s;everal charters under the
great &s;eal, hereafter narrated; and from hence
the &s;irname of the family.</P>
<P>The lands of Wemy&s;s-&s;hire, the pari&s;hes
of Kennoway, Markinch, Lochore&s;hire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which lye contiguous to one another, were
the undoubted property of the ancient earls
of Fife; a great part whereof were given by
Gillimichael the fourth earl, and Duncan, his
elde&s;t &s;on, to his &s;econd &s;on Hugo, the proge|nitor
of this noble family. And as the ma|ny
ample privileges conferred upon the great
MacDu&s;&s; by king Malcolm Canmore, and en|joyed
by his po&s;terity, are fully narrated by
our hi&s;torians, and briefly under the title earl
of Fife, page 27 4th of this work, we pro|ceed
to deduce the de&s;cent of the family of
Wemy&s;s from their immediate ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>IV. GILLIMICHAEL, fourth earl of Fife,
great grand&s;on of MacDuff the fir&s;t earl, was
witne&s;s to the foundation charter of the ab|bay
of Holyroodhou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St Andrews, and Dun|fermline.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1128, and is
mentioned in &s;everal other charters of king
David I.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1139, leaving i&s;&s;ue two &s;ons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Duncan,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugo,</HI> of whom the family of Wemy&s;s is
lineally de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Duncan, fifth earl of Fife, &s;ucceeded his fa|ther
Gillimichael,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St. Andrews, penes Mac|Farlane, page 301.</NOTE> and made a donation, <HI>Deo et
eccle&s;iae Sti. Andreae, &amp;c. eccle&s;iam de Markinch,
cum omnibus pertinen. &amp;c. pro &s;alute animae &s;uae,
et Helae comiti&s;&s;ae &s;pon&s;ae &s;uae, &amp;c.</HI> before the
year 1154; in which year earl Duncan died.
His male line ended in Duncan the thirteenth
earl, who died <HI>anno</HI> 1353, leaving i&s;&s;ue only
one daughter, who died without children.</P>
<P>V. HUGO, &s;econd &s;on of Gillimichael, the
fourth earl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. &amp; Char|tul. of Dun|fermline.</NOTE> got from his father the lands of
Wemy&s;s-&s;hire, &s;ome lands in Lochore-&s;hire,
and in the pari&s;h of Kennoway, all holding of
him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, earls of Fife.</P>
<P>He obtained al&s;o from his brother Duncan,
the fifth earl, &s;ome lands in the pari&s;h of
Markinch, with the &s;uperiority of the pa|tronage
of the church thereof, which is in|&s;tructed
by a donation hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>There is, in the chartulary of Dunferm|line,
in the reign of king Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 187.</NOTE> a pre|cept
directed to Duncan earl of Fife, and Hugo
&s;on of Gillimichael, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the year 1165;
in which year king Malcolm died.</P>
<P>Hugo died in the year 1167 or 1168, and
was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>
<P>VI. HUGO or EGO, who, being proprie|tor
of the lands of Markinch, confirmed his
uncle's donation, in the&s;e words: <HI>Omnibus,

left i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>VII. Sir JOHN, who &s;ucceeded him in all
his lands. He appears to have been a man

Methkil, from a &s;ea-port town of that name,
which is &s;ituate near the ea&s;t end of Wemy&s;s-&s;hire.</P>

that the progenitors of this noble fa|mily
are originally from Flanders; that a
man of rank came from that country in the
beginning of the reign of king David I. &s;et|tled
in Scotland, and was called Le Flammang,
from the country from whence he came;
which afterwards was pronounced Fleming,
and from hence the &s;irname of the family.</P>
<P>It appears from our hi&s;tories; that for &s;ome
time they were promi&s;cuou&s;ly de&s;igned Flan|dren&s;es,
Flamang, Le Flamang, and De Fla|maticus,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Dal|rymple's hi&s;t. collect. &amp;c.</NOTE> and after they had a&s;&s;umed Fle|ming
for their &s;irname, that in Latin was cal|led
<HI>Flandren&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them we find mentioned in
any record is,</P>
<P>I. BALDOWINUS le FLAMANG, who is
witne&s;s in a grant of Robert bi&s;hop of St.
Andrews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and chartulary of Gla&s;gow.</NOTE> to Herbert bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, of
the church of Locherworna, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the reign
of king David I. who &s;ucceeded to the crown
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1128, and died in 1153.</P>
<P>He had i&s;&s;ue one &s;on,</P>
<P>II. JORDANUS le FLAMANG, who, in the
reign of king Malcolm IV. is witne&s;s in a do|nation-charter
of <HI>Ada comiti&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dunferm. pe|nes MacFar|lane, p. 514.</NOTE> to the mo|na&s;tery

Northumberland, and died in 1178.</P>
<P>This Jordanus appears to have been much
about the court of king William, is witne&s;s to
many of his charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed.</NOTE> and was taken pri&s;oner
with him at the battle of Alnwick, <HI>anno</HI>
1174.</P>
<P>The next upon record is,</P>
<P>III. WILLIELMUS FLANDRENSIS, or le
Flamang, who flouri&s;hed in the reigns of king
William and king Alexander II. and was the
fir&s;t of this family that &s;ettled in the We&s;tern
parts of Scotland.</P>
<P>In a deed of king William to the mona|&s;tery

<P>He is witne&s;s to another charter of the &s;ame
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar|chiv. fam. de Linlithgow.</NOTE> confirming the teinds of Linlithgow
to the nuns of Manuel, before the year 1214,

<P>In the end of the reign of king Alexander
II. and beginning of king Alexander III. we
find in Scotland &s;everal of the &s;irname of Fle|ming,
or de Flandren&s;is, whom we cannot pre|tend
to connect with one another, be&s;ides
&s;ir Malcolm, progenitor of this family, of

<P><HI>Dominus Duncanus Flandren&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Pai&s;ley, penes comitem de Dundonald.</NOTE> who is wit|ne&s;s

<P>Al&s;o <HI>Simon Flandren&s;is,</HI> who is mentioned in

<P>We now return to,</P>
<P>IV. Sir MALCOLM, fir&s;t de&s;igned Flan|dren&s;is,

ever &s;ince continued to be the &s;irname of the

<P>This &s;ir Malcolm was a man of great di|&s;tinction

has no date, but appears to have been granted
before the year 1280. Whether this &s;ir Hugh
was brother of &s;ir Malcolm, we cannot pre|tend
to determine; but the Flemings were
become numerous in Scotland before the reign
of king Robert Bruce, there being no le&s;s
than eight of that &s;irname to be found &s;wear|ing
allegiance to king Edward I. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col|lect. vol. III. p. 651, 654, &amp;c.</NOTE>

Sir Malcolm was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on,</P>

<P>And though he, with many of his coun|trymen,
had been compelled to &s;wear allegi|ance
to king Edward I. of England, yet as
he believed a forced oath was not binding,
he was among&s;t the fir&s;t men of rank in the
kingdom that joined king Robert Bruce, in
defence of the liberties of his country, was
with him at Dumfries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, and all Scotch hi&s;torians.</NOTE> when the Cummin
was di&s;patched for betraying him, and was
very in&s;trumental in getting the crown &s;et
upon that great man's head, <HI>anno</HI> 1306.</P>
<P>Sir Robert being de&s;ervedly in great favour,
and highly e&s;teemed by king Robert Bruce,
obtained from him, for his many faithful &s;er|vices,
grants of &s;everal lands, particularly the
lord&s;hip of Lenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Wig|ton.</NOTE> and barony of Cumber|nauld,

high &s;heriff of the county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and chartulary of Lennox.</NOTE> and governor
of the ca&s;tle of Dunbarton; which offices he
executed with great fidelity.</P>
<P>He died in the end of the reign of king

<P>VII. Sir MALCOLM FLEMING of Cum|bernauld,
who &s;ucceeded him, and inherited
all the virtues of his worthy ance&s;tors, was a
firm and &s;teady friend of the royal family;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and in the beginning of the reign of king
David Bruce, was con&s;tituted governor of
Dunbarton ca&s;tle; in which office he did his
country &s;ignal &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This &s;ir Malcolm's capacity and integrity
being well known to the whole nation, he
was intru&s;ted with the tuition of the young
king.</P>
<P>After the unfortunate battles of Duplin
and Halidonhill, when the Baliol's party be|gun
to prevail and increa&s;e, the governor and
e&s;tates of the nation thought it advi&s;eable to
&s;end his maje&s;ty and his royal con&s;ort to France,
for the more &s;ecurity of their per&s;ons, and
the faithful &s;ir Malcolm was pitched upon to
be their conductor; which important charge
he executed with dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, and all Scotch hi&s;torians.</NOTE> They
arrived &s;afe in France, and met with a mo&s;t
noble and kind reception from king Philip.</P>
<P>Sir Malcolm immediately returned to his
government and command of the ca&s;tle of
Dunbarton, which he nobly defended, ahd
kept out again&s;t the whole Baliol party, when
almo&s;t every other fort in the kingdom had fur|rendered
to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 311.</NOTE> &s;o that it became the only
a&s;ylum and &s;afe retreat for the loyali&s;ts during
the ab&s;ence of king David.</P>
<P>The guardians of Scotland, having at la&s;t re|covered
a great part of the nation to the king's
obedience, longed much to have his maje&s;ty
again among&s;t them. The brave &s;ir Mal|colm
Fleming was thought the fitte&s;t man in
the kingdom to be employed in that great
tru&s;t. He went to France accordingly. He
again performed his office with prudence and
fidelity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and had the good fortune to conduct
his maje&s;ty &s;afe back to Scotland in July
1342.</P>
<P>King David was no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his kingdom, than he begun to reward his
faithful &s;ervants. He created &s;ir Malcolm
Fleming earl of Wigton, and be&s;towed upon
him all the lands belonging to that earldom,
to him and the heirs male of his body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in the archives of the family of Wigton, hae|red. de corp. &s;uo perlineam ma&s;cul. de|&s;cendentibus.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
by his royal charter, dated at Air, 9th No|vember
1342; and as this charter, which
contains many clau&s;es very honourable for the
family, is fully narrated in Crawfurd's peer|age,
page 493, to that we refer our readers.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1346, he made
a donation to the mona&s;tery of Newbottle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle, p. 169.</NOTE>
<HI>pro &s;alute animae &s;uae, &amp;c.</HI> to which Duncan

him&s;elf being then one of the Scotch com|mi&s;&s;ioners
who managed that important ne|gotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>The earl had a &s;on,</P>

i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>Thomas.</P>
<P>The old earl died about the year 1362,
and was &s;ucceeded in his e&s;tate and honours
by his grand&s;on,</P>
<P>IX. THOMAS, &s;econd earl of Wigton. He
was one of the noble Scotch heirs propo&s;ed to

<P>This earl having no lawful children, and
being very &s;en&s;ible that in con&s;equence of the
king's royal grant of the earldom of Wigton,
failing lawful male i&s;&s;ue of his body, that
earldom mu&s;t return to the crown: he there|fore,

1371, which was afterwards ratified and con|firmed
to the earls of Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by many char|ters
under the great &s;eal.</P>
<P>Immediately thereafter, the earl re&s;igned
his baronies of Lenzie, Cumbernauld, and &s;e|veral
others of his lands, in favours of his
cou&s;in and heir-male, &s;ir Malcolm Fleming of
Biggar, which were al&s;o ratified and confirm|ed
by charters under the great &s;eal, as will be
&s;hown hereafter.</P>
<P>This earl dying without lawful i&s;&s;ue, in
him ended the male line of &s;ir Malcolm of
Cumbernauld, elde&s;t &s;on of the &s;aid &s;ir Ro|bert
Fleming. The repre&s;entation, therefore,
of this noble family devolved upon &s;ir Mal|colm
Fleming of Biggar, &s;on of &s;ir Patrick,
before mentioned, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>VI. Sir PATRICK FLEMING, &s;econd &s;on
of &s;ir Robert, and brother german of the fir&s;t
&s;ir Malcolm of Cumbernauld, was likeways
a faithful and &s;teady friend of king Robert
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes marchionem de Tweeddale</NOTE> who appointed him high &s;heriff of the

<P>He married one of the daughters and co|heire&s;&s;es

<P>When the king went to France to e&s;pou&s;e

to oppo&s;e every appearance of innovation or
change in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the king|dom:
he therefore left the Engli&s;h party,
and went over to the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of &s;tate.</NOTE> believing it
more for the intere&s;t of his country.</P>
<P>In the year 1545, he founded and largely
endowed a collegiate church at Biggar, for a

<P>Soon after this a war broke out between
Scotland and England. The earl of Hart|ford,

could to oppo&s;e him. They came to an en|gagement
at Pinkie-field, near Mu&s;&s;elburgh.
The Engli&s;h obtained the victory, and the

<P>THIS noble family yields to none in the
kingdom for antiquity, and their &s;irname
is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;umed by the proprie|tors
of the lands and barony of Seaton, in
Ea&s;t Lothian, in the reign of king Malcolm
Canmore. Certain it is, they had va&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions

in very early times; but they were de|prived
of their Engli&s;h territories by king Ed|ward I.
as will be &s;hown hereafter.</P>

<P>Some of our antiquaries deduce their de|&s;cent
from,</P>
<P>DOUGAL de SEATON, who flouri&s;hed in
the reigns of king Edgar and king Alexander
I. both &s;ons of king Malcolm Canmore; which
king Alexander &s;ucceeded to the crown of
Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1107, and died in 1124.</P>
<P>That he was father of.</P>
<P>SECHER de SEATON, who is &s;aid by the
&s;ame authors, to have been proprietor of &s;e|veral
lands, both in Ea&s;t and We&s;t Lothian;
that he was progenitor of all the Seatons in
Scotland, and died in the reign of king David
I. leaving i&s;&s;ue a &s;on,</P>
<P>Alexander de Seaton, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As this Alexander is the fir&s;t we have found
mentioned in any authentic document, from
him we proceed to deduce the de&s;cent of this

<P>I. ALEXANDER de SEATON lived in the
reign of king David I. who &s;ucceeded to the
crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1124,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrymple's collect. page 426.</NOTE> and died in

called the barony of Riddel.</P>
<P>This Alexander was proprietor of the lands
of Seaton and Winton, in Ea&s;t Lothian, and
Winchburgh, in Linlithgow-&s;hire, which is in|&s;tructed

<P>At the unhappy battle of Methven, when

in Scotland, of which he had been mo&s;t un|ju&s;tly
forfeited by king Edward I. for his
loyalty to his lawful prince. That monarch
al&s;o deprived him of his e&s;tates in England,
which were very con&s;iderable, and be&s;towed
them upon his Engli&s;h nobles, who had been
mo&s;t active in the Scotch wars.</P>
<P>His lands in York&s;hire, called Whitby|&s;trand,
he gave to &s;ir Edmund Manly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba|ronage, tom. 11.</NOTE> who

gave to the noble family of Dalavale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem and Nisbet.</NOTE> which

power of this family to recover the&s;e lands
out of the hands of the Engli&s;h: However,
king Robert, in reward of his own merit, and
the &s;ufferings of his predece&s;&s;ors, granted him
&s;everal noble privileges, made him his own
&s;ecretary, and governor of Berwick, erected
his lands of Seaton into a free barony, with
the privileges of a free warreny, di&s;charging

of blood to the lord&s;hip of Brechin is fully &s;et
forth, the original in&s;trument being &s;till in the earl
of Panmure's cu&s;tody; and Thomas By&s;&s;et of Bal|wylo

&s;ir Thomas Maule, who was killed at Harlaw, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
