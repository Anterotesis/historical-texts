<P>MR. HUME, a few months be|fore his death, wrote the following &s;hort account of his own Life; and, in a codicil to his will, defired that it might be prefixed to the next edi|tion of his Works.

<HEAD>MY OWN LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult for a man to &s;peak long of him&s;elf without vanity; therefore, I &s;hall be &s;hort. It may be thought an in&s;tance of vanity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative &s;hall contain lit|tle more than the Hi&s;tory of my Writings; as, indeed, almo&s;t all my life has been &s;pent in literary pur&s;uits and occupations. The fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of mo&s;t of my writings was not &s;uch as to be an object of vanity.</P>
<P>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old &s;tyle, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of
<PB N="2" REF="6">
Home's, or Hume's; and my ance&s;tors had been proprietors of the e&s;tate, which my brother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, for &s;everal generati|ons. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, Pre&s;ident of the College of Ju&s;|tice; the title of Lord Halkerton came by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to her brother.</P>
<P>My family, however, was not rich; and being my&s;elf a younger brother, my pa|trimony, according to the mode of my country, was of cour&s;e very &s;lender. My father, who pa&s;&s;ed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a &s;i&s;ter, under the care of our mother, a woman of &s;ingular merit, who, though young and hand&s;ome, de|voted her&s;elf entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I pa&s;&s;ed through the ordinary cour&s;e of education with &s;ucce&s;s, and was &s;eized very early with a pa&s;&s;ion for literature, which has been the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of my life, and the great &s;ource of my enjoyments. My &s;tu|dious di&s;po&s;ition, my &s;obriety, and my in|du&s;try, gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profe&s;&s;ion for me; but I found an un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion to every thing but the pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophy and general learning; and while they fan|cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was &s;ecretly devouring.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
My very &s;lender fortune, however, being un&s;uitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active &s;cene of life. In 1734, I went to Bri&s;tol, with &s;ome recommendations to eminent merchants, but in a few months found that &s;cene totally un&s;uitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of pro|&s;ecuting my &s;tudies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have &s;teadily and &s;ucce&s;sfully pur&s;ued. I re&s;olved to make a very rigid frugality &s;upply my deficiency of fortune, to main|tain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in litera|ture.</P>
<P>During my retreat in France, fir&s;t at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou, I compo&s;ed my <HI>Treati&s;e of Human Nature.</HI> After pa&s;&s;ing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In the end of 1738, I publi&s;hed my Treati&s;e, and immediately went down to my mother and my brother, who lived at his country-hou&s;e, and was employing him&s;elf very judiciou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully in the improvement of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">
Never literary attempt was more unfor|tunate than my Treati&s;e of Human Nature. It fell <HI>dead born from the pre&s;s,</HI> without reaching &s;uch di&s;tinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and &s;anguine tem|per, I very &s;oon recovered the blow, and pro&s;ecuted with great ardour my &s;tudies in the country. In 1742, I printed at Edin|burgh the fir&s;t part of my E&s;&s;ays: the work was favourably received, and &s;oon made me entirely forget my former di&s;ap|pointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</P>
<P>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found al&s;o, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were de&s;irous of put|ting him under my care and direction, for the &s;tate of his mind and health required it.&mdash;I lived with him a twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a con|&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion to my &s;mall fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a &s;ecretary to his expedition, which was at fir&s;t meant again&s;t Canada, but ended in an incur&s;ion on the coa&s;t of France. Next year, to wit, 1747,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
I received an invitation from the General to attend him in the &s;ame &s;tation in his military emba&s;&s;y to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at the&s;e courts as aid-de-camp to the General, along with Sir Harry Er&s;kine and Captain Grant, now General Grant. The&s;e two years were al|mo&s;t the only interruptions which my &s;tudies have received during the cour&s;e of my life: I pa&s;&s;ed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune, which I called independent, though mo&s;t of my friends were inclined to &s;mile when I &s;aid &s;o; in &s;hort I was now ma&s;ter of near a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>I had always entertained a notion, that my want of &s;ucce&s;s in publi&s;hing the Trea|ti&s;e of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very u&s;ual indi&s;cre|tion, in going to the pre&s;s too early. I, therefore, ca&s;t the fir&s;t part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Under&s;tanding, which was publi&s;hed while I was at Turin. But this piece was at fir&s;t little more &s;ucce&s;sful than the Treati&s;e of Human Nature. On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account of Dr. Middle|ton's Free Enquiry, while my performance
<PB N="6" REF="10">
was entirely overlooked and neglected. A new edition, which had been publi&s;hed at London of my E&s;&s;ays, moral and political, met not with a much better reception.</P>
<P>Such is the force of natural temper, that the&s;e di&s;appointments made little or no im|pre&s;&s;ion on me. I went down in 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his country hou&s;e; for my mother was now dead. I there compo&s;ed the &s;econd part of my E&s;&s;ays, which I called Political Di&s;cour&s;es, and al&s;o my Enquiry concerning the Princi|ples of Morals, which is another part of my Treati&s;e that I ca&s;t anew. Meanwhile, my book&s;eller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfor|tunate Treati&s;e) were beginning to be the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; that the &s;ale of them was gradually increa&s;ing, and that new editions were demanded. An&s;wers by Reverends, and Right Reverends, came out two or three in a year; and I found, by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be e&s;teemed in good company. However, I had fixed a re&s;olution, which I inflexibly maintained, never to reply to any body; and not being very ira&s;cible in my temper, I have ea&s;ily kept my&s;elf clear of all literary &s;quabbles. The&s;e &s;ymptoms of a ri&s;ing reputation gave me encourage|ment, as I was ever more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee the favourable than unfavourable &s;ide of
<PB N="7" REF="11">
things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to po&s;&s;e&s;s, than to be born to an e&s;tate of ten thou&s;and a year.</P>
<P>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true &s;cene for a man of let|ters. In 1752, were publi&s;hed at Edin|burgh, where I then lived, my Political Di&s;cour&s;es, the only work of mine that was &s;ucce&s;sful on the fir&s;t publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the &s;ame year was publi&s;hed at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Mo|rals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that &s;ubject), is of all my writings, hi&s;torical, philo&s;ophical, or litera|ry, incomparably the be&s;t. It came unno|ticed and unob&s;erved into the world.</P>
<P>In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates cho&s;e me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the Hi&s;|tory of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, &s;anguine in my ex|pectations of the &s;ucce&s;s of this work. I thought that I was the only hi&s;torian, that
<PB N="8" REF="12">
had at once neglected pre&s;ent power, in|tere&s;t, and authority, and the cry of po|pular prejudices; and as the &s;ubject was &s;uited to every capacity, I expected pro|portional applau&s;e. But mi&s;erable was my di&s;appointment: I was a&s;&s;ailed by one cry of reproach, di&s;approbation, and even dete&s;ta|tion; Engli&s;h, Scotch, and Iri&s;h, Whig, and Tory, churchman and &s;ectary, freethinker and religioni&s;t, patriot and courtier, united in their rage again&s;t the man, who had pre&s;umed to &s;hed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Straf|ford; and after the fir&s;t ebullitions of their fury were over, what was &s;till more morti|fying, the book &s;eemed to &s;ink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he &s;old only forty-five copies of it. I &s;carcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con&s;iderable for rank or letters, that could indure the book. I mu&s;t only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which &s;eem two odd exceptions. The&s;e dignified prelates &s;eparately &s;ent me me&s;&s;ages not to be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>I was, however, I confe&s;s, di&s;couraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to &s;ome provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my name, and never more have returned
<PB N="9" REF="13">
to my native country. But as this &s;cheme was not now practicable, and the &s;ub&s;e|quent volume was con&s;iderably advanced, I re&s;olved to pick up courage and to per|&s;evere.</P>
<P>In this interval, I publi&s;hed at London my Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion, along with &s;ome other &s;mall pieces: its public entry was rather ob&s;cure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet again&s;t it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and &s;currili|ty, which di&s;tingui&s;h the Warburtonian &s;chool. This pamphlet gave me &s;ome con|&s;olation for the otherwi&s;e indifferent recep|tion of my performance.</P>
<P>In 1756, two years after the fall of the fir&s;t volume, was publi&s;hed the &s;econd vo|lume of my Hi&s;tory, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revo|lution. This performance happened to give le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only ro&s;e it&s;elf, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</P>
<P>But though I had been taught by expe|rience that the Whig party were in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of be&s;towing all places, both in the &s;tate and in literature, I was &s;o little inclined to yield to their &s;en&s;ele&s;s clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther
<PB N="10" REF="14">
&s;tudy, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two fir&s;t Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory &s;ide. It is ridiculous to con&s;ider the Engli&s;h con&s;titution before that period as a regular plan of liberty.</P>
<P>In 1759, I publi&s;hed my Hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of Tudor. The clamour again&s;t this performance was almo&s;t equal to that again&s;t the Hi&s;tory of the two fir&s;t Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of public folly, and conti|nued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edinburgh, to fini&s;h, in two volumes, the more early part of the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, which I gave to the pub|lic in 1761, with tolerable, and but tole|rable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this variety of winds and &s;ea&s;ons, to which my writings had been expo&s;ed, they had &s;till been making &s;uch advances, that the copy-mo|ney given me by the book&s;ellers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen|dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to &s;et my foot out of it; and retain|ing the &s;atisfaction of never having pre|ferred a reque&s;t to one great man, or even
<PB N="11" REF="15">
making advances of friend&s;hip to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of pa&s;&s;ing all the re&s;t of my life in this philo&s;ophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the lea&s;t acquainted, to attend him on his em|ba&s;&s;y to Paris, with a near pro&s;pect of be|ing appointed &s;ecretary to the emba&s;&s;y, and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, how|ever inviting, I at fir&s;t declined, both be|cau&s;e I was reluctant to begin connexions with the great, and becau&s;e I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Pa|ris, would prove di&s;agreeable to a per&s;on of my age and humour: but on his lord|&s;hip's repeating the invitation, I accepted of it. I have every rea&s;on, both of plea|&s;ure and intere&s;t, to think my&s;elf happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother, General Conway.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not &s;een the &s;trange effects of modes, will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and &s;tations. The more I re&s;iled from their exce&s;&s;ive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real &s;atisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of &s;en&s;ible, knowing, and polite company with which
<PB N="12" REF="16">
that city abounds above all places in the univer&s;e. I thought once of &s;ettling there for life.</P>
<P>I was appointed &s;ecretary to the emba&s;|&s;y; and in &s;ummer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was <HI>charg&eacute; d' affaires</HI> till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards the end of the year. In the beginning of 1776, I left Paris, and next &s;ummer went to Edinburgh, with the &s;ame view as for|merly, of burying my&s;elf in a philo&s;ophi|cal retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's friend&s;hip, than I left it; and I was de&s;irous of trying what &s;uperfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a competency. But in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be Under-&s;ecretary; and this invitation, both the character of the per&s;on, and my connexions with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining. I returned to Edin|burgh in 1769, very opulent (for I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed a revenue of 1000 l. a year), healthy, and, though &s;omewhat &s;tricken in years, with the pro&s;pect of enjoying long my ea&s;e, and of &s;eeing the increa&s;e of my reputation.</P>
<P>In &s;pring 1775, I was &s;truck with a di&s;|order in my bowels, which at fir&s;t gave me
<PB N="13" REF="17">
no alarm, but has &s;ince, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. I have &s;uffered very little pain from my di&s;order; and what is more &s;trange, have, notwith|&s;tanding the great decline of my per&s;on, never &s;uffered a moment's abatement of my &s;pirits; in&s;omuch, that were I to name the period of my life, which I &s;hould mo&s;t choo&s;e to pa&s;s over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame ardour as ever in &s;tudy, and the &s;ame gaiety in company. I con|&s;ider, be&s;ides, that a man of &s;ixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmi|ties; and though I &s;ee many &s;ymptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at la&s;t with additional lu&s;tre, I knew that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To conclude hi&s;torically with my own character, I am, or rather was (for that is the &s;tyle I mu&s;t now u&s;e in &s;peaking of my|&s;elf, which emboldens me the more to &s;peak my &s;entiments); I was, I &s;ay, a man of mild di&s;po&s;itions, of command of tem|per, of an open, &s;ocial, and cheerful hu|mour, capable of attachment, but little &s;u&s;ceptible of enmity, and of great modera|tion in all my pa&s;&s;ions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling pa&s;&s;ion, never
<PB N="14" REF="18">
&s;oured my temper, notwith&s;tanding my frequent di&s;appointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and carele&s;s, as well as to the &s;tudious and lite|rary; and as I took a particular plea&s;ure in the company of mode&s;t women, I had no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the recep|tion I met with from them. In a word, though mo&s;t men any wi&s;e eminent, have found rea&s;on to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her beleful tooth: and though I wantonly expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they &s;eemed to be di&s;|armed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occa&s;ion to vindicate any one circum&s;tance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, would have been glad to in|vent and propagate any &s;tory to my di&s;ad|vantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot &s;ay there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of my&s;elf, but I hope it is not a mi&s;placed one; and this is a matter of fact which is ea&s;ily cleared and a&s;certained.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH, LL. D. TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><PB REF="20"><DATELINE>Kirkaldy, Fife&s;hire, <DATE>Nov. 9, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a real, though a very melan|choly plea&s;ure, that I &s;it down to give you &s;ome account of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his la&s;t illne&s;s.</P>
<P>Though, in his own judgment, his di&s;ea&s;e was mortal and incurable, yet he allowed him&s;elf to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he &s;et out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his other papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, &s;hall begin where his ends.</P>
<P>He &s;et out for London towards the end of April, and at Morpeth met with Mr. John Home and my&s;elf, who had both come down from London on purpo&s;e to &s;ee him, expecting to have found him at Edin|burgh. Mr. Home returned with him,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
and attended him during the whole of his &s;tay in England, with that care and atten|tion which might be expected from a tem|per &s;o perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that &s;he might expect me in Scotland, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing my journey. His di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to yield to exerci&s;e and change of air, and when he arrived in Lon|don, he was apparently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was advi&s;ed to go to Bath to drink the wa|ters, which appeared for &s;ome time to have &s;o good an effect upon him, that even he him&s;elf began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opinion of his own health. His &s;ymptoms, however, &s;oon returned with their u&s;ual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but &s;ubmitted with the utmo&s;t cheerfulne&s;s, and the mo&s;t per|fect complacency and re&s;ignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found him&s;elf much weaker, yet his cheerfulne&s;s never abated, and he continued to divert him&s;elf, as u&s;ual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amu&s;ement, with the conver&s;a|tion of his friends; and, &s;ometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whi&s;t. His cheerfulne&s;s was &s;o great, and his conver&s;ation and amu&s;e|ments run &s;o much in their u&s;ual &s;train,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
that, notwith&s;tanding all bad &s;ymptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall tell your friend, Colonel Edmond&s;tone,"</Q> &s;aid Doctor Dundas to him one day, <Q REND="inline">"that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery." </Q><Q REND="inline">"Doc|tor,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"as I believe you would not chu&s;e to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as fa&s;t as my enemies, if I have any, could wi&s;h, and as ea&s;ily and cheerfully as my be&s;t friends could de&s;ire."</Q> Colo|nel Edmond&s;tone &s;oon afterwards came to &s;ee him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bidding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French ver&s;es in which the Abb&eacute; Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approaching &s;eparation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare. Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firmne&s;s were &s;uch, that his mo&s;t affectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that &s;o far from being hurt by this frank|ne&s;s, he was rather plea&s;ed and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had ju&s;t received, and which he immedi|ately &s;howed me. I told him, that though I was &s;en&s;ible how very much he was weakened, and that appearances were in

many re&s;pects very bad, yet his cheerful|ne&s;s was &s;till &s;o great, the &s;pirit of life &s;eemed &s;till to be &s;o very &s;trong in him, that I could not help entertaining &s;ome faint hopes. He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"Your hopes are groundle&s;s. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's &s;tanding, would be a very bad di&s;ea&s;e at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening, I feel my&s;elf weaker than when I ro&s;e in the morning; and when I ri&s;e in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am &s;en|&s;ible, be&s;ides, that &s;ome of my vital parts are affected, &s;o that I mu&s;t &s;oon die."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"if it mu&s;t be &s;o, you have at lea&s;t the &s;atisfaction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in par|ticular, in great pro&s;perity."</Q> He &s;aid, that he felt that &s;atisfaction &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lucian's Dia|logues of the Dead, among all the excu&s;es which are alleged to Charon for not entering readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no hou&s;e to fini&s;h, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wi&s;hed to revenge him&s;elf. <Q>"I could not well imagine,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"what excu&s;e I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done every thing of con&s;equence which I ever meant to do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and

friends in a better &s;ituation than that in which I am now likely to leave them; I, therefore, have all rea&s;on to die content|ed."</Q> He then diverted him&s;elf with inventing &s;everal jocular excu&s;es, which he &s;uppo&s;ed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very &s;urly an&s;wers which it might &s;uit the character of Charon to re|turn to them. <Q REND="inline">"Upon further con&s;idera|tion,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I thought I might &s;ay to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may &s;ee how the Public receives the alterations."</Q> But Charon would an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"When you have &s;een the effect of the&s;e, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of &s;uch excu&s;es; &s;o, hone&s;t friend, plea&s;e &s;tep into the boat."</Q> But I might &s;till urge,  <Q REND="inline">"Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public.

But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching di&s;&s;olution with great cheerfulne&s;s, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the &s;ubject but when the con|ver&s;ation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation happened to require: it was a &s;ubject indeed which occurred pretty frequently, in con&s;equence of the inquiries which his friends who came to &s;ee him naturally made concerning the &s;tate of his health. The conver&s;ation which I men|tioned above, and which pa&s;&s;ed on Thur&s;|day the 8th of Augu&s;t, was the la&s;t, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become &s;o very weak, that the com|pany of his mo&s;t intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulne&s;s was &s;till &s;o great, his complai&s;ance and &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition were &s;till &s;o entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talking more, and with greater exertion, than &s;uited the weakne&s;s of his body. At his own de&s;ire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edinburgh, where I was &s;taying partly upon his ac|count, and returned to my mother's hou&s;e here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would &s;end for me whenever he wi&s;hed to &s;ee me; the phy&s;ician who &s;aw him mo&s;t frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occa&s;ionally an account of the &s;tate of his health.</P>

On the 22d of Augu&s;t, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Since my la&s;t, Mr. Hume has pa&s;&s;ed his time pretty ea&s;ily, but is much weaker. He &s;its up, goes down &s;tairs once a day, and amu&s;es him&s;elf with reading, but &s;eldom &s;ees any body. He finds that even the con|ver&s;ation of his mo&s;t intimate friends fa|tigues and oppre&s;&s;es him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impatience, or low &s;pirits, and pa&s;&s;es his time very well with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of amu&s;ing books.</P>

<P>I received the day after a letter from Mr. Hume him&s;elf, of which the following is an extract.<LETTER LANG="eng">

<SALUTE>MY DEAREST FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am obliged to make u&s;e of my ne|phew's hand in writing to you, as I do not ri&s;e to-day. * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>I go very fa&s;t to decline, and la&s;t night had a &s;mall fever, which I hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illne&s;s, but unluckily it has, in a great mea&s;ure, gone off. I cannot &s;ubmit to your coming over

here on my account, as it is po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee you &s;o &s;mall a part of the day, but Doctor Black can better inform you con|cerning the degree of &s;trength which may from time to time remain with me. Adieu, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Three days after I received the following letter from Doctor Black.<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Edinburgh, Monday, <DATE>26th Augu&s;t, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Ye&s;terday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be|tween Thur&s;day and Friday, when his di&s;|ea&s;e became exce&s;&s;ive, and &s;oon weakened him &s;o much, that he could no longer ri&s;e out of his bed. He continued to the la&s;t perfectly &s;en&s;ible, and free from much pain or feelings of di&s;tre&s;s. He never dropped the &s;malle&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of impatience; but when he had occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the peo|ple about him, always did it with affection and tenderne&s;s. I thought it improper to write to bring you over, e&s;pecially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you de&s;iring you not to come. When he be|came very weak it co&s;t him an effort to &s;peak, and he died in &s;uch a happy com|po&s;ure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">Thus died our mo&s;t excellent and never to be forgotten friend; concerning who&s;e philo&s;ophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge variou&s;ly, every one approving, or condemning them, according as they hap|pen to coincide or di&s;agree with his own; but concerning who&s;e character and con|duct there can &s;carce be a difference of opi|nion. His temper, indeed, &s;eemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be al|lowed &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, than that per|haps of any other man I have ever known. Even in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of his fortune, his great and nece&s;&s;ary frugality never hindered him from exerci&s;ing upon proper occa&s;ions, acts both of charity and genero&s;ity. It was a frugality founded, not upon a varice, but upon the love of independency. The ex|treme gentlene&s;s of his nature never weak|ened either the firmne&s;s of his mind, or the &s;teadine&s;s of his re&s;olutions. His con|&s;tant plea&s;antry was the genuine effu&s;ion of good-nature and good-humour, tem|pered with delicacy and mode&s;ty, and without even the &s;lighte&s;t tincture of ma|lignity, &s;o frequently the di&s;agreeable &s;ource of what is called wit in other men. It never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it &s;eldom failed to plea&s;e and delight, even tho&s;e who were the objects of it. To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all
<PB N="26" REF="29">
his great and amiable qualities, which contributed more to endear his conver&s;ation. And that gaiety of temper, &s;o agreeable in &s;ociety, but which is &s;o often accompanied with frivolous and &s;uperficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the mo&s;t &s;evere application, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive learning, the greate&s;t depth of thought, and a capacity in every re&s;pect the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive. Upon the whole, I have always con&s;idered him, both in his life|time and &s;ince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wi&s;e and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.</P>
