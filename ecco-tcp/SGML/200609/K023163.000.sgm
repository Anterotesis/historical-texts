<L>_YES, you de&s;pi&s;e the Man to Books confin'd,</L>
<L>Who from his Study rails at human kind;</L>
<L>Tho' what he learns he &s;peaks, and may advance</L>
<L>Some gen'ral Maxims, or be right by Chance.</L>
<L>The coxcomb Bird, &s;o talkative and grave,</L>
<L>That from his Cage cries Cuckold, Whore and Knave,</L>
<L>Tho' many a Pa&s;&s;enger he rightly call,</L>
<L>You hold him no Philo&s;opher at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet the Fate of all Extremes is &s;uch,</L>
<L>Men may be read, as well as Books, too much.</L>
<L>To Ob&s;ervations which our &s;elves we make,</L>
<L>We grow more partial for th' Ob&s;erver's &s;ake;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more; the Diff'rence is as great between</L>
<L>The Optics &s;eeing, as the Objects &s;een.</L>
<L>All Manners take a tincture from our own,</L>
<L>Or come di&s;colour'd, thro' our Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hown,</L>

<L>Life's Stream for Ob&s;ervation will not &s;tay,</L>

<LG>
<L>Oft, in the Pa&s;&s;ions wild rotation to&s;t,</L>
<L>Our Spring of Action to our &s;elves is lo&s;t:</L>
<L>Tir'd, not determin'd, to the la&s;t we yield,</L>
<L>And what comes then is ma&s;ter of the field.</L>

<L>(Tho' pa&s;t the recollection of the thought)</L>

<L>Something, as dim to our internal view,</L>

<L>That what we <HI>chanc'd,</HI> was what we <HI>meant,</HI> to do.</L>
<L>Behold! if Fortune, or a Mi&s;tre&s;s frowns,</L>
<L>Some plunge in bus'ne&s;s, others &s;have their Crowns:</L>

Perhaps Pro&s;perity becalm'd his Brea&s;t;</L>
<L>Perhaps the Wind ju&s;t &s;hifted from the Ea&s;t.</L>

<L>Pride guides his Steps, and bids him &s;hun the Great.</L>

<L>A plain, rough Hero turn a crafty Knave?</L>
<L>Alas! in Truth the Man but chang'd his Mind,</L>

<LG>
<L>'Tis from <HI>high Life,</HI> high Characters are drawn;</L>
<L>A Saint in Crape is twice a Saint in Lawn;</L>
<L>A Judge is ju&s;t, a Chanc'lor ju&s;ter &s;till;</L>

Wi&s;e, if a Mini&s;ter; but if a King,</L>

<L>In Life's low vale, (the &s;oil the Virtues like)</L>

<L>Others &s;o very clo&s;e, they're hid from none;</L>

<L>Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at &s;ight:</L>
<L>And ev'ry Child hates <HI>Shylock,</HI> tho' his Soul</L>
<L>Still &s;its at &s;quate, and peeps not from its hole.</L>
