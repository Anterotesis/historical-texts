<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay of this Edition, that the reader has here a much more correct and compleat copy of the <HI>DUNCIAD,</HI> than has hitherto ap|pear'd: I cannot an&s;wer but &s;ome mi&s;takes may have &s;lipt into it, but a va&s;t number of others will be pre|vented, by the Names being now not only &s;et at length, but ju&s;tified by the authorities and rea&s;ons given. I make no doubt, the Author's own motive to u&s;e real rather than feign'd names, was his care to pre&s;erve the Innocent from any fal&s;e Applications; whereas in the former editions which had no more than the Ini|tial letters, he was made, by Keys printed here, to hurt the inoffen&s;ive; and (what was wor&s;e) to abu&s;e his friends, by an impre&s;&s;ion at <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>The Commentary which attends this Poem was &s;ent me from &s;everal hands, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be une|qually written; yet will have one advantage over mo&s;t Commentaries, that it is not made upon Conjec|tures, or at a remote di&s;tance of Time: and the rea|der cannot but derive one plea&s;ure from the very <HI>Ob|&s;curity</HI> of the per&s;ons it treats of, that it partakes of the nature of a <HI>Secret,</HI> which mo&s;t people love to
<PB N="6" REF="6">
be let into, tho' the Men or the Things be ever &s;o incon&s;iderable or trivial.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> it was judg'd proper to give &s;ome ac|count: for &s;ince it is only in this Monument that they mu&s;t expect to &s;urvive (and here &s;urvive they will, as long as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue &s;hall remain &s;uch as it was in the reigns of Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> and King <HI>GEORGE,)</HI> it &s;eem'd but humanity to be&s;tow a word or two upon each, ju&s;t to tell what he was, what he writ, when he liv'd, and when he dy'd.</P>
<P>If a word or two more are added upon the chief Offenders; 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the brea&s;t, to mark the Enormities for which they &s;uffer'd; le&s;t the Correction only &s;hould be remember'd, and the Crime forgotten.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Articles, it was thought &s;ufficient barely to tran&s;cribe from <HI>Jacob, Curl,</HI> and other writers of their own rank, who were much better acquainted with them than any of the Authors of this Comment can pretend to be. Mo&s;t of them had drawn each other's Characters on certain occa&s;ions; but the few here in&s;erted are all that could be &s;aved from the general de&s;truction of &s;uch works.</P>
<P>Of the part of <HI>Scriblerus</HI> I need &s;ay nothing: his Manner is well enough known, and approv'd by all but tho&s;e who are too much concern'd to be Judges.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
The <HI>Imitations</HI> of the <HI>Ancients</HI> are added, to gra|tify tho&s;e who either never read, or may have forgot|ten them; together with &s;ome of the <HI>Parodies</HI> and Al|lu&s;ions to the mo&s;t excellent of the <HI>Moderns.</HI> If from the frequency of the former any man think the Poem too much a <HI>Cento;</HI> our Poet will but appear to have done the &s;ame thing in je&s;t which <HI>Boileau</HI> did in earne&s;t; and upon which <HI>Vida, Fraca&s;torius,</HI> and many of the mo&s;t eminent <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, profe&s;&s;edly va|lued them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER, Occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t correct EDITION of the DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with plea&s;ure I hear that you have procu|red a correct Copy of the DUNCIAD, which the many &s;urreptitious ones have rendered &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary; and it is yet with more, that I am inform|ed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY: a Work &s;o requi&s;ite, that I cannot think the Au|thor him&s;elf would have omitted it, had he ap|prov'd of the fir&s;t Appearance of this Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
Such <HI>Notes</HI> as have occurr'd to me I herewith &s;end you: You will oblige me by in&s;erting them among&s;t tho&s;e which are, or will be, tran&s;mitted to you by others; &s;ince not only the Author's friends, but even &s;trangers, appear engag'd by hu|manity, to &s;ome care of an orphan of &s;o much ge|nius and &s;pirit, which its parent &s;eems to have a|bandoned from the very beginning, and &s;uffered to &s;tep into the world naked, unguarded, and unattended.</P>
<P>It was upon reading &s;ome of the abu&s;ive papers lately publi&s;h'd, that my great regard to a per&s;on, who&s;e friend&s;hip I e&s;teem as one of the chief ho|nours of my life, and a much greater re&s;pect to Truth than to him or any man living, engag'd me in Enquiries of which the inclos'd Notes are the fruit.</P>
<P>I perceived, that mo&s;t of the&s;e authors had been (doubtle&s;s very wi&s;ely) the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors. They had try'd till they were weary, what was to be got by railing at each other: no body was either concern'd, or &s;urpriz'd, if this or that &s;cribler was prov'd a dunce; but every one was curious to read what could be &s;aid to prove Mr. POPE one, and was ready to pay &s;omething for &s;uch a di&s;covery: A &s;tratagem which would they fairly own, might not only reconcile them to me, but &s;creen
<PB N="10" REF="10">
them from the re&s;entment of their lawful Superiors, whom they daily abu&s;e, only (as I charitably hope) to get that <HI>by</HI> them, which they cannot get <HI>from</HI> them.</P>
<P>I found this was not all: Ill &s;ucce&s;s in that had tran&s;ported them to Per&s;onal abu&s;e, either of him|&s;elf, or (what I think he could le&s;s forgive) of his friends. They had call'd men of virtue and ho|nour Bad men, long before he had either lei&s;ure or inclination to call them Bad Writers: and &s;ome had been &s;uch old offenders, that he had quite for|gotten their per&s;ons as well as their &s;landers, till they were pleas'd to revive them.</P>
<P>Now what had Mr. POPE done before, to in|cen&s;e them? He had publi&s;h'd tho&s;e works which are in the hands of every body, in which not the lea&s;t mention is made of any of them. And what has he done &s;ince? He has laugh'd and written the DUNCIAD. What has that &s;aid of them? A very &s;erious truth which the publick had &s;aid before, that they were dull: And what it had no &s;ooner &s;aid, but they them&s;elves were at great pains to procure, or even purcha&s;e room in the prints, to te&s;tify under their hands to the truth of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;till have been &s;ilent, if either I had &s;een any inclination in my friend to be &s;erious
<PB N="11" REF="11">
with &s;uch accu&s;ers, or if they had only meddled with his writings: &s;ince whoever publi&s;hes puts him&s;elf on his trial by his Country. But when his moral character was attack'd, and in a manner from which neither Truth nor Virtue can &s;ecure the mo&s;t innocent, in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accu&s;ation with the ju&s;t and impartial, yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accu&s;er (I mean, by Authors <HI>without names)</HI> then I thought, &s;ince the danger was common to all, the concern ought to be &s;o; and that it was an act of ju&s;tice to detect the Authors, not only on this account, but as many of them are the &s;ame who for &s;everal years pa&s;t, have made free with the greate&s;t of names in Church and State, ex|pos'd to the world the private misfortunes of Fa|milies, abus'd all even to Women, and who&s;e pro|&s;tituted papers (for one or other Party in the unhappy divi&s;ions of their Country) have in&s;ulted the Fallen, the Friendle&s;s, the Exil'd, and the Dead.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, which I take to be a publick con|cern, I have already confe&s;s'd I had a private one. I am one of that number who have long lov'd and e&s;teem'd Mr. POPE, and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings (which we ever thought the lea&s;t valuable part of his character) but the hono&s;t, open, and beneficent man, that we mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="12">
e&s;teem'd and lov'd in him. Now if what the&s;e people &s;ay were believ'd, I mu&s;t appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave, either impos'd on my &s;elf, or impo&s;ing on them: &s;o that I am as much intere&s;ted in the confutation of the&s;e ca|lumnies, as he is him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am no Author, and con&s;equently not to be &s;u&s;|pected either of jealou&s;y or re&s;entment again&s;t any of the men, of whom &s;carce one is known to me by &s;ight; and as for their writings, I have &s;ought them (on this one occa&s;ion) in vain, in the clo&s;ets and libraries of all my acquaintance. I had &s;till been in the dark, if a Gentleman had not procur'd me (I &s;uppo&s;e from &s;ome of them&s;elves, for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies) the pa&s;&s;ages I &s;end you. I &s;olemnly prote&s;t I have added nothing to the malice or ab&s;urdity of them; which it behoves me to de|clare, &s;ince the vouchers them&s;elves will be &s;o &s;oon and &s;o irrecoverably lo&s;t. You may in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent it, by pre&s;erving at lea&s;t their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which we have done in a Li&s;t in the <HI>Appendix.</HI></NOTE> Titles, and di&s;covering (as far as you can depend on the truth of your information) the names of the con|ceal'd authors.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
The fir&s;t objection I have heard made to the Poem is, that the per&s;ons are too <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> for &s;atire. The per&s;ons them&s;elves, rather than allow the ob|jection, would forgive the &s;atire; and if one could be tempted to afford it a &s;erious an&s;wer, were not all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates, popular in&s;urrections, the in&s;olence of the rabble without doors, and of dome&s;ticks with|in, mo&s;t wrongfully cha&s;ti&s;ed, if the Meanne&s;s of offenders indemnified them from puni&s;hment? On the contrary, Ob&s;curity renders them more dange|rous, as le&s;s thought of: Law can pronouce judg|ment only on open facts, Morality alone can pa&s;s cen&s;ure on intentions of mi&s;chief; &s;o that for &s;ecret calumny, or the arrow flying in the dark, there is no publick puni&s;hment left, but what a good Wri|ter inflicts.</P>
<P>The next objection is, that the&s;e &s;ort of au|thors are <HI>Poor.</HI> That might be pleaded as an ex|cu&s;e at the Old Baily, for le&s;&s;er crimes than De|famation, (for 'tis the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all who are try'd there) but &s;ure it can be none, for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputati|on &s;upplies the want of it in him&s;elf? I que&s;tion not but &s;uch authors are poor, and heartily wi&s;h the objection were removed by any hone&s;t liveli|hood. But Poverty is here the accident, not the &s;ubject: he who de&s;cribes malice and villany to be
<PB N="14" REF="14">
pale and meagre, expre&s;&s;es not the lea&s;t anger again&s;t Palene&s;s or leanne&s;s, but again&s;t malice and villany. The Apothecary in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> is poor, but is he therefore ju&s;tified in vending poi|&s;on? Not but Poverty it&s;elf becomes a ju&s;t &s;ubject of &s;atire, when it is the con&s;equence of vice, prodigality, or neglect of one's lawful calling; for then it increa&s;es the publick burden, fills the &s;treets and highways with Robbers, and the garrets with Clippers, Coiners, and Weekly Journali&s;ts.</P>
<P>But admitting that two or three of the&s;e offend le&s;s in their morals, than in their writings: mu&s;t Poverty make Non&s;en&s;e &s;acred? If &s;o, the fame of bad authors would be much better than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of a hundred had ever been call'd by his right name.</P>
<P>They mi&s;take the whole matter: It is not cha|rity to encourage them in the way they follow, but to get 'em out of it: For Men are not bunglers becau&s;e they are poor, but they are poor becau&s;e they are bunglers.</P>
<P>Is it not plea&s;ant enough, to hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their per&s;ons and Characters were too &s;acred for Satire; and the publick objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for Ridicule? But whether bread or fame be their end, it mu&s;t be allow'd, our author by
<PB N="15" REF="15">
and in this Poem, has mercifully given 'em a little of both.</P>
<P>There are two or three, who by their <HI>rank</HI> and <HI>fortune</HI> have no benefit from the former objections (&s;uppo&s;ing them good) and the&s;e I was &s;orry to &s;ee in &s;uch company. But if without any provoca|tion, two or three gentlemen will fall upon one, in an affair wherein his intere&s;t and reputation are equally imbark'd, they cannot certainly, after they have been content to print them&s;elves his <HI>enemies,</HI> com|plain of being put into the Number of them?</P>
<P>Others, I'm told, pretend to have been once his <HI>Friends.</HI> Surely they are their enemies who &s;ay &s;o, &s;ince nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done. But of this I can't per&s;uade my &s;elf, when I con&s;ider the con|&s;tant and eternal aver&s;ion of all bad writers to a good one.</P>
<P>Such as claim a merit from being his <HI>Admirers,</HI> I would gladly ask, if it lays him under a per|&s;onal obligation? at that rate he would be the mo&s;t oblig'd humble &s;ervant in the world. I dare &s;wear for the&s;e in particular, he never de&s;ir'd them to be his Admirers, nor promis'd in return to be theirs: that had truly been a &s;ign he was of their acquain|tance; but would not the malicious world have &s;u&s;pected &s;uch an approbation of &s;ome motive wor&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="16">
than ignorance, in the Author of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on <HI>Critici&s;m?</HI> Be it as it will, the rea&s;ons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting, for his works and theirs are the very &s;ame that they were.</P>
<P>One therefore of their affertions I believe may be true, "That he has a contempt for their wri|tings." And there is another which would proba|bly be &s;ooner allow'd by him&s;elf than by any good judge be&s;ide, "That his own have found too much &s;ucce&s;s with the publick." But as it cannot con&s;i&s;t with his mode&s;ty to claim this as a ju&s;tice, it lies not on him, but entirely on the publick, to defend its own judgment.</P>
<P>There remains what in my opinion might &s;eem a better plea for the&s;e people, than any they have made u&s;e of. If Ob&s;curity or Poverty were to exempt a man from &s;atire, much more &s;hould Folly or Dulne&s;s, which are &s;till more involuntary, nay as much &s;o as per&s;onal Deformity. But even this will not help them: Deformity becomes an ob|ject of Ridicule when a man &s;ets up for being hand&s;ome; and &s;o mu&s;t Dulne&s;s when he &s;ets up for a Wit. They are not ridicul'd becau&s;e Ridicule in it&s;elf is, or ought to be, a plea&s;ure; but becau&s;e it is ju&s;t, to undeceive and vindicate the hone&s;t and unpretending part of mankind from Impo&s;ition, be|cau&s;e particular intere&s;t ought to yield to general,
<PB N="17" REF="17">
and a great number who are not naturally Fools ought never to be made &s;o in complai&s;ance to a few who are. Accordingly we find that in all ages, all vain pretenders, were they ever &s;o poor or ever &s;o dull, have been con&s;tantly the topicks of the mo&s;t candid Satiri&s;ts, from the <HI>Codrus</HI> of JUVENAL to the <HI>Damon</HI> of BOILEAU.</P>
<P>Having mention'd BOILEAU, the greate&s;t Poet and mo&s;t judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his Talents, and yet perhaps more ad|mirable for his Judgment in the proper application of them; I cannot help remarking the re&s;emblance betwixt him and our Author in Qualities, Fame, and Fortune; in the di&s;tinctions &s;hewn to them by their Superiors, in the general e&s;teem of their E|quals, and in their extended reputation among&s;t Foreigners; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate, as he has had for his Tran&s;la|tors per&s;ons of the mo&s;t eminent rank and abilities in their re&s;pective nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m</HI> in <HI>French</HI> Ver&s;e by General <HI>Hamilton.</HI> The &s;ame in Ver&s;e al&s;o by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Roboton,</HI> Coun&s;ellor and Privy Secretary to King <HI>George</HI> I. after by the <HI>Abbe Reynel,</HI> in Ver&s;e, with Notes, <HI>Paris</HI> 1730.

Others of his works by <HI>Salvini</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> &amp;c. his E&s;&s;ays and Di&s;&s;ertations on <HI>Homer</HI> in <HI>French, Paris</HI> 1728.</NOTE> But the re&s;emblance
<PB N="18" REF="18">
holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abus'd by the ignorant Pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the lea&s;t memory will remain but in their own writings, and in the notes made upon them. What BOILEAU has done in almo&s;t all his poems, our Author has only in this: I dare an&s;wer for him he will do it in no more; and on his principle of attacking few but who had &s;lander'd him, he could not have done it at all, had he been confin'd from cen&s;uring ob&s;cure and worthle&s;s per&s;ons, for &s;carce any other were his enemies. However, as the parity is &s;o remarkable, I hope it will continue to the la&s;t; and if ever he &s;hall give us an edition of this Poem him&s;elf, I may &s;ee &s;ome of 'em treated as gently (on their repentance or better merit) as <HI>Perault</HI> and <HI>Quinault</HI> were at la&s;t by BOILEAU.</P>
<P>In one point I mu&s;t be allow'd to think the character of our Engli&s;h Poet the more amiable.
<PB N="19" REF="19">
He has not been a follower of Fortune or Succe&s;s; he has liv'd with the Great without flattery, been a friend to Men in power without pen&s;ions, from whom as he ask'd, &s;o he receiv'd no favour, but what was done Him in his friends. As his Satires were the more ju&s;t for being delay'd, &s;o were his Pane|gyricks; be&s;tow'd only on &s;uch per&s;ons as he had familiarly known, only for &s;uch virtues as he had long ob&s;erv'd in them, and only at &s;uch times as others cea&s;e to prai&s;e, if not begin to calumniate them, I mean when out of power, or out of fa|&s;hion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> at the time the Town de|claim'd again&s;t his book of Poems: Mr <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> after his death: Sir <HI>William Trumbull,</HI> when he had re&s;ign'd the office of Secretary of State: Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> at his leaving <HI>England</HI> after the Queen's death: Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> in his la&s;t decline of Life: Mr. Secretary <HI>Crags</HI> at the end of the South-Sea Year, and after his death: Others only in <HI>Epitaphs.</HI></NOTE>. A Satire therefore on writers &s;o notori|ous for the contrary practi&s;e, became no man &s;o well as him&s;elf, as none (it is plain) was &s;o little in their friend&s;hips, or &s;o much in that of tho&s;e whom they had mo&s;t abus'd, namely the Greate&s;t and Be&s;t of all Parties. Let me add a further rea|&s;on, that tho' ingag'd in their Friend&s;hips, he never e&s;pous'd their Animo&s;ities; and can almo&s;t &s;ingly

challenge this honour, not to have written a line of any man, which thro' Guilt, thro' Shame, or thro' Fear, thro' variety of Fortune, or change of Inte|re&s;ts, he was ever unwilling to own.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with remarking what a plea&s;ure it mu&s;t be to every reader of Humanity, to &s;ee all along that our Author, in his very laughter, is not indulging his own ill-nature, but only puni&s;hing that of others.

<HEAD>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS OF THE POEM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem, as it celebrated the mo&s;t grave and antient of things, Chaos, Night and Dul|ne&s;s, &s;o is it of the mo&s;t grave and antient kind. <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Ari&s;totle)</HI> was the fir&s;t who gave the <HI>Form,</HI> and (&s;aith <HI>Horace)</HI> who adapted the <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> to heroic poe&s;y. But even before this, may be ra|tionally pre&s;umed from what the antients have left written, was a piece by <HI>Homer</HI> compo&s;ed, of like nature and matter with this of our Poet. For of Epic &s;ort it appeareth to have been, yet of matter &s;urely not unplea&s;ant, witne&s;s what is reported of it by the Learned Archbi&s;hop <HI>Eu&s;tatbius,</HI> in Ody&s;&s;. k. And accordingly <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his poetic, chap. 4. doth further &s;et forth, that as the Iliad and Ody&s;|&s;ey
<PB N="24" REF="24">
gave example to Tragedy, &s;o did this poem to Comedy its fir&s;t Idaea.</P>
<P>From the&s;e authors al&s;o it &s;hou'd &s;eem, that the He|ro or chief per&s;onage of it was no le&s;s <HI>ob&s;cure,</HI> and his <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>&s;entiments</HI> no le&s;s quaint and &s;trange (if indeed not more &s;o) than any of the actors in our poem. MARGITES was the name of this per&s;onage, whom Antiquity recordeth to have been <HI>Dunce the fir&s;t;</HI> and &s;urely from what we hear of him, not un|worthy to be the root of &s;o &s;preading a tree, and &s;o numerous a po&s;terity. The poem therefore celebrating him, was properly and ab&s;olutely a <HI>Dunciad;</HI> which tho' now unhappily lo&s;t, yet is its nature &s;ufficiently known by the infallible tokens afore&s;aid. And thus it doth appear, that the fir&s;t Dunciad was the fir&s;t Epic poem, written by <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf, and anterior even to the Iliad or Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>
<P>Now fora&s;much as our Poet had tran&s;lated tho&s;e two famous works of <HI>Homer</HI> which are yet left, he did conceive it in &s;ome &s;ort his duty to imitate that al&s;o which was lo&s;t: And was therefore induced to be &s;tow on it the &s;ame Form which <HI>Homer</HI>'s is reported to have had, namely that of Epic poem, with a title al&s;o framed after the antient <HI>Greek</HI> manner, to wit, that of <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>Wonderful it is, that &s;o few of the moderns have been &s;timulated to attempt &s;ome Dunciad! Since in
<PB N="25" REF="25">
the opinion of the multitude, it might co&s;t le&s;s pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic. But po&s;&s;ible it is al&s;o that, on due reflection, the maker might find it ea&s;ier to paint a <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> a <HI>Brute</HI> or a <HI>Godfry,</HI> with ju&s;t pomp and dignity heroic, than a <HI>Margites,</HI> a <HI>Codrus,</HI> a <HI>Fleckno,</HI> or a <HI>Tibbald.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall next declare the occa&s;ion and the cau&s;e which moved our Poet to this particular work. He lived in tho&s;e days, when (after Providence had per|mitted the Invention of Printing as a &s;courge for the &s;ins of the learned) Paper al&s;o became &s;o cheap, and printers &s;o numerous, that a deluge of Authors cover'd the land: Whereby not only the peace of the hone&s;t unwriting &s;ubject was daily mole&s;ted, but unmerciful demands were made of his applau&s;e, yea of his money, by &s;uch as would neither earn the one, or de&s;erve the other: At the &s;ame time, the Liberty of the Pre&s;s was &s;o unlimited, that it grew dangerous to refu&s;e them either; For they would forthwith publi&s;h &s;lan|ders unpuni&s;h'd, the authors being anonymous; nay the immediate publi&s;hers thereof lay &s;culking under the wings of an Act of Parliament, a&s;&s;uredly intended for better purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Bo&s;&s;u, du poeme Epique, <HI>ch. 8.</HI></NOTE>. Now our author living in tho&s;e times, did con|ceive it an endeavour well worthy an hone&s;t Satiri&s;t,
<PB N="26" REF="26">
to di&s;&s;uade the dull, and puni&s;h the malicious, <HI>the only way that was left.</HI> In that public-&s;pirited view he laid the plan of this Poem, as the greate&s;t &s;ervice he was capable (without much hurt or being &s;lain) to render his dear country. Fir&s;t, taking things from their Ori|ginal, he con&s;idereth the Cau&s;es creative of &s;uch Au|thors, namely <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Poverty;</HI> the one born with them, the other contracted, by neglect of their pro|per talent thro' &s;elf-conceit of great abilities This truth he wrappeth in an <HI>Allegory,</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> ch. 7.</NOTE>. (as the con&s;truc|tion of Epic poe&s;y requireth) and feigns, that one of the&s;e Godde&s;&s;es had taken up her abode with the other, and that they jointly in&s;pir'd all &s;uch writers and &s;uch works. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Book</HI> 1. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 32, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

The great power of the&s;e Godde&s;&s;es acting in alliance (whereof as the one is the mother of Indu&s;try, &s;o is the other of plod|ding) was to be exemplify'd in &s;ome <HI>one, great</HI> and <HI>re|markable</HI>

low Critici&s;ms: He finds his Name to be <HI>Tibbald,</HI> and he becomes of cour&s;e the Hero of the poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fable</HI> being thus according to be&s;t example one and entire, as contain'd in the propo&s;ition; the <HI>Machi|nery</HI> is a continued chain of Allegories, &s;etting forth the whole power, mini&s;try, and empire of Dulne&s;s, extended thro' her &s;ubordinate in&s;truments, in all her various operations.</P>
<P>This is branched into <HI>Epi&s;odes,</HI> each of which hath its Moral a part, tho' all conducive to the main end. The crowd a&s;&s;embled in the &s;econd book demon&s;trates the de&s;ign to be more exten&s;ive than to bad Poets only, and that we may expect other Epi&s;odes, of the Patrons, Encouragers, or Payma&s;ters of &s;uch authors, as occa|&s;ion &s;hall bring them forth: And the third book, if well con&s;ider'd, &s;eemeth to embrace the whole world. Each of the Games relateth to &s;ome or other vile cla&s;s of writers: The fir&s;t concerneth the Plagiary, to whom he giveth the name of <HI>More;</HI> the &s;econd the libellous Novelli&s;t, whom he &s;tyleth <HI>Eliza;</HI> the third the flat|tering Dedicator, the fourth the bawling Critic or noi&s;y Poet, the fifth the dark and dirty Party-writer, and &s;o of the re&s;t; a&s;&s;igning to each &s;ome <HI>proper name</HI> or other, &s;uch as he could find.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Characters,</HI> the publick hath already ac|knowledg'd how ju&s;tly they are drawn: The manners are &s;o depicted, and the &s;entiments &s;o peculiar to tho&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="29">
to whom applied, that &s;urely to transfer them to any other, or wi&s;er, per&s;onages, would be exceeding dif|ficult: And certain it is, that every per&s;on concerned being con&s;ulted apart, hath readily owned the re&s;em|blance of every portrait, his own excepted.</P>
<P>The <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> are &s;ingular; the <HI>Compari&s;ons</HI> very quaint, the <HI>Narration</HI> various, yet of one colour&punc; The purity and cha&s;tity of <HI>Diction</HI> is &s;o pre&s;erved, that in the places mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious, not the <HI>words</HI> but only the <HI>images</HI> have been cen&s;ured, and yet are tho&s;e images no other than have been &s;anctified by Antient and Cla&s;&s;ical Authority, tho' (as was the manner of tho&s;e good times,) not &s;o curiou&s;ly wrapped up: yea and commented upon by mo&s;t grave Doctors, and ap|proved Critics.</P>
<P>As it beareth the name of <HI>Epic,</HI> it is thereby &s;ub|jected to &s;uch &s;evere indi&s;pen&s;able rules as are laid on all Neoterics, a &s;trict imitation of the Antient; in&s;o|much that any deviation, accompanied with whatever poetic beauties, hath always been cen&s;ured by the &s;ound Critic. How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece, appeareth not only by its general &s;tructure, but by particular allu&s;ions infinite, many whereof have e&s;caped both the commentator and poet him&s;elf; yea divers by his exceeding diligence are &s;o alter'd and in|terwoven with the re&s;t, that &s;everal have already been

and more will be, by the ignorant abu&s;ed, as altoge|ther and originally his own.</P>
<P>In a word, the whole poem proveth it&s;elf to be the work of our Author when his faculties were in full vigour and perfection: at that exact time when years have ripened the Judgment, without di|mini&s;hing the Imagination; which by good critics is held to be punctually at <HI>forty.</HI> For, at that &s;ea&s;on it was that <HI>Virgil</HI> fini&s;h'd his <HI>Georgics;</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> at the like age compo&s;ing his <HI>Arthurs,</HI> de|clared the &s;ame to be the very <HI>Acme</HI> and pitch of life for Epic poe&s;y: tho' &s;ince he hath alter'd it to <HI>&s;ixty,</HI> the year in which he publi&s;hed his <HI>Alfred. a.</HI> True it is, that the talents for <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> namely &s;martne&s;s, quick cen&s;ure, vivacity of remark, certainty of a&s;&s;eve|ration, indeed all but acerbity, &s;eem rather the gifts of Youth than of riper age: But it is far otherwi&s;e in <HI>Poetry;</HI> witne&s;s the works of Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> who beginning with Critici&s;m, became after|wards &s;uch Poets as no age hath parallel'd.

<HEAD>TESTIMONIES OF AUTHORS. Concerning our POET and his WORKS.</HEAD>
<P>NOW before we pre&s;ent thee with our Exercita|tions on this mo&s;t delectable Poem (drawn from the many volumes of our <HI>Adver&s;aria</HI> on modern Authors) we &s;hall here, according to the laudable u&s;age of Editors, collect the various judgments of the Learned concerning our Poet: Various indeed, not only of different authors, but of the &s;ame au|thor at different &s;ea&s;ons.

Hence al&s;o thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections, not only of a critical, but a moral nature, by be|ing let into many particulars of the Per&s;on as well as Genius, and of the Fortune as well as Merit, of our Author: In which, if I relate &s;ome things of little concern peradventure to thee, and &s;ome of as little even to him; I entreat thee to con&s;ider how minutely all true Critics and commentators are wont to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch, and how material they &s;eem to them&s;elves if to none other. Forgive me therefore gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon be|come tedious; allow me to take the &s;ame pain to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, mode&s;t or arrogant; as another, whether his author were fair or brown, &s;hort or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a ca&s;&s;ock?</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS on BOOK the FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>This Poem was writ in 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was publi&s;hed at Dublin, and re|printed at London in 120. another at Dublin, and another at London in 8vo, and three others in 120. the &s;ame year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in 4to 1728-9, which was attended with the following Notes. We are will|ing to acquaint Po&s;terity that this Poem (as it here &s;tands) was pre&s;ented to King <HI>George</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> and his Queen, by the hands of Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> on the 12th of March, 1728-9.</P>

Nor is the neglect of a <HI>Sin|gle Letter</HI> &s;o trivial as to &s;ome it may appear; the al|teration whereof in a learned language is an <HI>Atchieve|ment that brings honour</HI> to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. B. will be remembered to po&s;terity for his performances of <HI>this &s;ort,</HI> as long as the world &s;hall have any e&s;teem for the Remains of <HI>Menander</HI> and <HI>Philemon.</HI> <BIBL>THEOBALD.</BIBL></P>

<P>Two things there are, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of which the very ba&s;is of all Verbal critici&s;m is founded
<PB N="115" REF="112">
and &s;upported: The fir&s;t, that an author could never fail to u&s;e the <HI>be&s;t word,</HI> on every occa&s;ion: The &s;e|cond, that a Critic cannot chu&s;e but know, <HI>which that is?</HI> This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, fir&s;t that the author could <HI>never have us'd it,</HI> and &s;econdly, that he mu&s;t have u&s;ed <HI>that very one</HI> which we con|jecture in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore enough admire the learned <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> for his alteration of the text in the two la&s;t ver&s;es of the preceding book, which in all the former editions &s;tood thus,

<L>And the loud nation croak'd, <HI>God &s;ave King</HI> Log!</L></Q>
He has with great judgment tranpo&s;ed the&s;e two epi|thets, putting <HI>hoar&s;e</HI> to the nation, and <HI>loud</HI> to the thunder: and this being evidently the true reading, he vouch&s;afed not &s;o much as to mention the former; for which a&s;&s;ertion of the ju&s;t right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all &s;ound commentators.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> warmly contends that <HI>Bavius</HI> was no incon&s;iderable author; nay, that <Q REND="inline">"he and <HI>Maevius</HI> had (even in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s days) a very formidable Party at <HI>Rome,</HI> who thought them much &s;uperior to <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace:</HI>" For (&s;aith he) "I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit."</Q> Rem. on <HI>Pr.

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>PREFACE</HI> prefix'd to the five fir&s;t im|perfect Editions of the <HI>DUNCIAD,</HI> printed at <HI>Dublin</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>Octavo</HI> and <HI>Duod.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The Publi&s;her.]</HI> Who he was is uncertain; but <HI>Edward Ward</HI> tells us in his preface to <HI>Durgen,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that mo&s;t judges are of opinion this preface is not of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> extraction but <HI>Hibernian,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> He means Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> who whether publi&s;her or not, may be &s;aid in a &s;ort to be author of the poem: For when he, together with Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> (for rea&s;ons &s;pecify'd in the preface to their Mi&s;cellanies) determin'd to own the mo&s;t trifling pieces in which they had any hand, and to de&s;troy all that remain'd in their power, the fir&s;t sketch of this poem was &s;natch'd from the fire by Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> who per&s;uaded his friend to proceed in it, and to him it was therefore in&s;cribed. But the occa|&s;ion of printing it was as follows.</P>
<P>There was publi&s;h'd in tho&s;e Mi&s;cellanies, a Treati&s;e of the <HI>Bathos,</HI> or <HI>Art of Sinking in Poetry,</HI> in which was a chapter, where the &s;pecies of bad writers were rang'd in cla&s;&s;es, and initial letters of names prefix'd for the mo&s;t part at random. But &s;uch was the num|ber of poets eminent in that art, that &s;ome one or other took every letter to him&s;elf. All fell into &s;o violent a fury, that for half a year or more the common News|papers (in mo&s;t of which they had &s;ome property, as being hired writers) were filled with the mo&s;t abu&s;ive fal&s;hoods and &s;currilities they could po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e: A liberty no ways to be wonder'd at in tho&s;e people, and in tho&s;e papers, that, for many years, during the uncontrolled licen&s;e of the pre&s;s, had a&s;per&s;ed almo&s;t all the great characters of the age, and this with impu|nity, their own per&s;ons and names being utterly &s;e|cret and obscure. This gave Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> the thought, that he had now &s;ome opportunity of doing good, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> and dragging into light the&s;e common ene|mies of mankind; &s;ince to invalidate this univer&s;al &s;lan|der, it &s;ufficed to &s;hew what contemptible men were the authors of it. He was not without hopes, that by manife&s;ting the dullne&s;s of tho&s;e who had only malice to recommend them, either the book&s;ellers would not find their account in employing them, or the men them&s;elves, when di&s;covered, want courage to proceed in &s;o unlawful an occupation. This it was that gave birth to the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and he thought an happine&s;s, that by the late flood of &s;lander on him&s;elf, he had ac|quired &s;uch a peculiar right over their names as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to his de&s;ign.</P></NOTE> The <HI>PUBLISHER</HI> to the <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT will be found a true ob&s;ervation, tho' &s;ome|what &s;urprizing, that when any &s;candal is vented again&s;t a man of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction and cha|racter, either in the State or in Literature, the publick

<P>Not to &s;earch too deeply into the rea&s;on hereof, I will only ob&s;erve as a fact, that every week for the&s;e two months pa&s;t, the town has been per&s;ecuted with <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pamphlets, Adverti&s;ements,</HI> &amp;c.] See the li&s;t of the&s;e anonymous papers, with their dates and authors thereunto annexed, in the third article of this Ap|pendix.</NOTE>. pam|phlets, adverti&s;ements, letters, and weekly e&s;&s;ays, not only again&s;t the wit and writings, but again&s;t the cha|racter and per&s;on of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> And that of all tho&s;e men who have received plea&s;ure from his works, which by mode&s;t computation may be about a <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>About a hundred thou&s;and.]</HI> It is &s;urprizing with what &s;tupidity this preface, which is almo&s;t a con|tinued irony, was taken by tho&s;e authors.

<P>Further, that he was in his peculiar intimacy, ap|pears from the knowledge he manife&s;ts of the mo&s;t private authors of all the anonymous pieces again&s;t him, and from his having in this poem attacked <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The publi&s;her in the&s;e words went a little too far: but it is certain whatever names the reader finds that are unknown to him, are of &s;uch: and the exception is only of two or three, who&s;e dulne&s;s or &s;currility all mankind agreed to have ju&s;tly entitled them to a place in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></NOTE>. no man living, who had not before printed, or publi&s;hed, &s;ome &s;candal agai&s;t this gentleman.</P>
<P>How I came po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, is of no concern to the reader; but it would have been a wrong to him had I detain'd this publication: &s;ince tho&s;e names which are its chief ornaments die off daily &s;o fa&s;t, as mu&s;t ren|der it too &s;oon unintelligible If it provoke the au|thor to give us a more perfect edition, I have my end.</P>

Who he is I cannot &s;ay, and (which is great pity) there is certainly <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>There is certainly nothing in his Style,</HI> &amp;c.] This irony had &s;mall effect in concealing the author. The <HI>Dunciad,</HI> imperfect as it was, had not been publi&s;h'd two days, but the whole town gave it to Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></NOTE>. nothing in his &s;tyle and manner of writing which can di&s;tingui&s;h or di&s;cover him: For if it bears any re&s;emblance to that of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> 'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpo&s;e, with a view to have it pa&s;s for his. But by the frequency of his allu&s;ions to <HI>Virgil,</HI> and a labour'd (not to &s;ay af|fected) <HI>&s;hortne&s;s</HI> in imitation of him, I &s;hould think him more an admirer of the <HI>Roman</HI> poet than of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and in that not of the &s;ame ta&s;te with his friend.</P>
<P>I have been well inform'd, that this work was the labour of full <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The labour of full &s;ix years,</HI> &amp;c.] This al&s;o was hone&s;tly and &s;eriou&s;ly believ'd, by divers of the gentle|men of the <HI>Dunciad.

<P>Hence al&s;o we learn the true title of the Poem; which with the &s;ame certainty as we call that of <HI>Homer</HI> the <HI>Iliad,</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> of <HI>Camoens</HI> the <HI>Lu&s;iad,</HI> of <HI>Voltaire</HI> the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Henriad.]</HI> The <HI>French</HI> poem of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Vol|taire,</HI> entitled <HI>La Henriade,</HI> had been publi&s;h'd at <HI>Lon|don</HI> the year before.</NOTE>. <HI>Henriad,</HI> we may pronounce could have been, and can be no other, than</P>
<P><HI>The DUNCIAD.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;tyled <HI>Heroic,</HI> as being <HI>doubly</HI> &s;o; not only with re&s;pect to its nature, which according to the be&s;t rules of the ancients, and &s;tricte&s;t ideas of the moderns, is critically &s;uch; but al&s;o with regard to the heroical di&s;po&s;ition and high courage of the wri|ter, who dar'd to &s;tir up &s;uch a formidable, irritable, and implacable race of mortals.</P>
<P>The time and date of the Action is evidently in the la&s;t reign, when the office of City poet expir'd
<PB N="237" REF="234">
upon the death of <HI>Elkanah Settle,</HI> and it is fix'd to the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>Geo. Thorold.</HI> But there may ari&s;e &s;ome ob&s;curity in Chronology from the <HI>names</HI> in the poem, by the inevitable removal of &s;ome au|thors, and in&s;ertion of others, in their niches. For whoever will con&s;ider the unity of the whole de&s;ign, will be &s;en&s;ible, that the <HI>Poem was not made for the&s;e Authors, but the&s;e Authors for the Poem:</HI> I &s;hould judge that they were clapp'd in as they ro&s;e, fre&s;h and fre&s;h, and chang'd from day to day; in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thru&s;t new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; &s;ince when he &s;hall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the per&s;ons than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to pre&s;erve them as they are, than to change them for fictitious 'names, by which the &s;atire would only be multiplied and applied to many in&s;tead of one. Had the Hero, for in&s;tance, been called <HI>Codrus,</HI> how many would have affirm'd him to have been Mr. <HI>W.</HI> Mr. <HI>D.</HI> Sir <HI>R. B,</HI> &amp;c. but now all that unju&s;t &s;candal is &s;aved by calling him <HI>Theobald,</HI> which by good luck happens to be the name of a real per&s;on.</P>
<P>I am indeed aware, that this name may to &s;ome appear too mean for the Hero of an Epic Poem: But it is hoped, they will alter that opinion, when they find, that an author no le&s;s eminent than <HI>la Bruyere</HI> has honour'd him with frequent mention, and thought him worthy a place in his characters.</P>
