<HEAD>THE
<HI REND="blackletterType">Free-Holders Plea</HI>
AGAINST
STOCK-JOBBING
Elections of PARLIAMENT Men.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Nations in the World, we
may &s;ay, without Detracting from the
Character of our Native Country, that
<HI>England</HI> has, for &s;ome Ages pa&s;t, been the mo&s;t
Di&s;tracted with Divi&s;ions and Parties among
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Union, and Charity, the one relating to our
Civil, the other to Religious Concerns,
are Stangers in the Land; and whether we
&s;peak of difference in Opinions, or differences
in Intere&s;t, we mu&s;t own that we are the mo&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Divided, Quarrel&s;ome Nation under the Sun.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> is the only Nation of <HI>Europe</HI> which
can pretend to Match us in this Ill-natur'd Qua|lity,
and yet all things examin'd <HI>Poland</HI> cannot
come near us.</P>
<P>'Twas a true Character given of us, by the
Wi&s;e&s;t Prince&s;s that ever Govern'd us, Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI>
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were harder to be Go|vern'd
in time of Peace than War.</P>
<P>What Experience our pre&s;ent Governors have
had of this Old Maxim in the &s;hort Peace we
have had, we leave to every Man's Ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>Not
to enter into the Hi&s;tory of the Divi&s;ions,
and Civil Di&s;turbances in the Nations Peace,
which is too fre&s;h in our Memories; and cannot
be review'd without &s;en&s;ible Regret by any
Man, who Loves his Country, or has the lea&s;t
regard to its Pro&s;perity or Reputation.</P>
<P>Yet we cannot but expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of the
Encrea&s;e, and more than ordinary progre&s;s of
this wrangling Temper, on the pre&s;ent Affairs
of the Publick; and with what Fatal &s;ucce&s;s it
Invades us in the mo&s;t Minute, and mo&s;t tender
Parts; with what &s;ubtilty it &s;preads its contagi|ous
Qualities into the Vitals of the State, and
<PB N="3" REF="4">
from thence de&s;cends into the le&s;s Noble Parts,
the Trade of the Nation.</P>
<P>Religion and the State have felt the plague of
Contention, eating out the very Entrails of the
Nation, and with a &s;ort of alternate Motion,
have equally come under its Malignant Effects,
for almo&s;t Four entire Centuries of Years, and
as if it was not enough to hurt us in tho&s;e two
E&s;&s;entials of our Peace, behold the Plague is
broke out in our Trade, which is the third, and
next the other two, the Supreme Article of the
Kingdoms Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Wherefore we the Yeomandry, and poor Free-holders
of <HI>England,</HI> having, God knows, no Hand
in the Differences, tho' we have a deep &s;hare in
the Damages, do take the freedom to make our
ju&s;t Remarks upon the Cau&s;es, which, as we ap|prehend,
have conduc'd too much to the pre|&s;ent
unhappy Divi&s;ions of the Nation; and
which, if &s;ome care be not taken to prevent it,
may compleat the Ruin of us all.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom of late Parliaments have E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
two great Rivals in Trade, the Old, and
the New <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Companies.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to Arraign the Ju&s;tice of
tho&s;e <HI>Wonderful and Unintelligible A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> if they
<PB N="4" REF="5">
were in being, we dare not, and, &s;ince they
are not in being, 'tis not very Honourable, you'll
&s;ay, to &s;peak ill of the Dead.</P>
<P>But thus far, we hope, without offence, we
may be allow'd to give our Opinions in this par|ticular
Affair, that tho' &s;eparately and di&s;tinctly,
every part of the proceedings of tho&s;e Parlia|ments,
might be literally and po&s;itively Ju&s;t,
and Right, we mean as to the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Compa|nies.</P>
<P>Yet
when they are Conjunctively, and in the
General put together, and reflected on, they
&s;eem to be clouded both as to the publick Intere&s;t;
and as to the Honour of the proceedings, with
dark Enigma's of State, and Inexplicable Para|doxes,
too hard for us to under&s;tand, &s;uch as
the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. That during the Being of one Company,
and before the Extent of their Charter, and Pri|vileges
were Expir'd, we mean the 3 years al|low'd
them for bringing Home their Effects,
there &s;hould be Erected a New Company, with
power of immediate Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Had the New Company not commenc'd their Trade, till
the time of the Old was expir'd, or near it, there might
have been a Succe&s;&s;ion of Companies, not two Rival Com|panies
in Being together.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="6">
2. That the manner of the Trading by the New
Company &s;hould be &s;o Order'd, as that the Old
Company by Sub&s;cribing &s;hou'd enable them|&s;elves
to Trade &s;eparately, as a Company &s;till;
and that with &s;o Capital a Stock, as always to
&s;hare the Trade with the New Company; and &s;o
at the &s;ame time two contraries be upheld by
the &s;ame Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Had the New Company been &s;o E&s;tabli&s;h'd, that at the
Expiration of the Old, it &s;hou'd have had a Commanding
Superiority, by which no other Men cou'd have Traded,
but under them, by Permi&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame time, leaving
all Men at liberty to come in and Trade with them,
there had been then no Rivals in the Trade, which will,
no que&s;tion, as they now &s;tand, &s;oon reduce the Trade to
very low Terms.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That after this New Company was E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
and the Mony paid in, to the U&s;e of
the Government, <HI>which &s;ome &s;ay was the thing which
fir&s;t mov'd the Conception of a New Company, and which,
if the Old Company wou'd have procur'd, they had never
been Broke nor the New one Born.</HI> That after this
New Company was Erected, the Stock advanc'd,
and the Mony to the Government pay'd they
&s;hou'd prohibit by Act of Parliament Two Thirds
of their Trade, and &s;o Starve the Child they had
Begotten.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
<HI>If the Trade was ruinous to the Engli&s;h Manufactures,
and the Intere&s;t of the Nation it &s;hou'd have been fore&s;een,
before Gentlemen had payd their Mony, or el&s;e it &s;hou'd
not have been Examin'd afterwards.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That after all this they &s;hou'd grant a New
Charter to the Old Company, by Virtue of
which they have both Power and Time to Trade,
to the prejudice of the New, even to their Hearts
Content.</P>
<P>We &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e particulars but thus,
that really we do not under&s;tand the con&s;i&s;ten|cy
of them with them&s;elves, they &s;tand to us as
Arcana's of Policy, too high to be medled with.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hou'd we trouble our Heads about them,
but leave both Companies to confound one ano|ther,
as we believe they will; but that we find &s;o
great a part of the Nation concern'd in their
Quarrel, as gives us cau&s;e to Ob&s;erve, that the I&s;|&s;ue
of them &s;eems to threaten the Nation with
&s;omething Fatal.</P>
<P>For the Power of the&s;e two Rivals is &s;o great,
and their Intere&s;t in the Kingdom &s;o popular and
High, that Matters of higher Moment than
Trade &s;eem to depend upon them, while all
the proceedings of their Members, both in the
City, and in the late Parliament, in both which
<PB N="7" REF="8">
their Parties have been numerous, are, and have
been guided according to their Intere&s;t in their
re&s;pective Companies.</P>
<P>The Grand Work which the whole Na|tion
is now Intent upon, is chu&s;ing their Re|pre&s;entatives
in Parliament, Chu&s;ing Men to
Meet, and advi&s;e with the King about the mo&s;t
Important Affairs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And while all Men ought to be fixing their
Eyes upon &s;uch Men as are be&s;t Qualified to Sit
in that Place of Honour, and to Examine who
are fitte&s;t to be Intru&s;ted with the Religion and
Peace of <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence of
two <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Companies, as if the Intere&s;t of either
Company were to be Nam'd in the Day with the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant
Religion and the publick Peace,</HI> or as if they, who
are fit to be Repre&s;entatives of the People in the
great Matters of Peace and War, Leagues, and Alli|ances
of Neighbours, Succe&s;&s;ion of Crowns, and
Protection of the Prote&s;tant Religion, &s;hould
not be capable of deciding the petty Contro|ver&s;y
in Trade between two Rivial Companies.</P>
<P>The Grand Que&s;tion ask'd now, when your
Vote is requir'd for a Parliament Man, is not as it
ought to be, Is he a Man of Sen&s;e, of Religion, of Ho|ne&s;ty
and E&s;tate?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
But, What Company is he for, the New, or
the Old?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI> &s;et up as a Candidate in a Neigh|bouring
Borough, Who &s;et him up? 'Tis
known he is no Inhabitant there, nor ever was,
has no Free-hold, or Copy-hold, or Lea&s;e-hold
E&s;tate there, nor is not known there, and of him|&s;elf
po&s;&s;ibly was not acquainted with 20 People
there.</P>
<P>But enquire what Company he is for; and
then &s;ee if all the re&s;t of that Company were not
found running over the Water, to make their
Intere&s;t with their Friends for his Election.</P>
<P>And the Time would fail us, and the Paper
too, to give you a Li&s;t of the Shop-keepers,
Merchants, and Pedlers, and the Stock-Jobbers,
who, with their Hir'd Liveries, in Coaches, and
Six Hor&s;es, who, God knows, never had Coach
or Livery of their own, are come down into the
Countreys, being detach'd from <HI>London,</HI> by either
Company to get them&s;elves cho&s;en Parliament-Men,
by tho&s;e Boroughs, who are ea&s;ie to be
Impos'd upon, and who, like well-meaning Men,
that know nothing of the Matter, Choo&s;e them up|on
the Recommendation of the Pountry Gentle|men
that have Intere&s;t in the Towns, which
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Country Gentlemen are prevail'd upon to quit
their own preten&s;ions, to advance theirs; but
by what Arguments we cannot pretend to De|termine.</P>
<P>We
have formerly been told that &s;pending Mo|ny
upon the Inhabitants of Towns, was a pernici|ous
practice; and no doubt it was, and an Act
of Parliament has been wi&s;ely made to prevent
it.</P>
<P>What any Man cou'd propo&s;e to him&s;elf by
&s;pending 2000 (nay, 11000 pound was &s;pent
at the Town of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI>) to be cho&s;en to Sit
in a Hou&s;e, where there is not one Farthing to be
gotten hone&s;tly, was a My&s;tery every one did not
under&s;tand.</P>
<P>But here is a New way of getting Mony: For
if a Country Gentleman has &s;o much Intere&s;t in
a Town, that he can be cho&s;en a Member of
Parliament, if he will decline it, here is a &s;ort of
Folks they call <HI>Stock-Jobbers,</HI> help him to a 1000
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s for his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This is Parliament-Jobbing, and a New
Trade, which as we thought it the Duty of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Free-holders thus to Expo&s;e, we hope an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament will think it their Duty to
prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
For as this Stock-Jobbing in its own Nature,
is only a new Invented &s;ort of <HI>Deceptio Vi&s;us,</HI> a <HI>Le|gerde-main</HI>
in Trade; &s;o mix'd with Trick and
Cheat, that twou'd puzzle a good <HI>Logician</HI> to
make it out by <HI>Syllogi&s;m:</HI> So nothing can be more
Fatal in <HI>England</HI> to our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution;
and which in time may be &s;o to our Liberty and
Religion, than to have the Intere&s;ts of Elections
Jobb'd upon Exchange for Mony, and Transfer'd
like <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Stock, to tho&s;e who bid mo&s;t.</P>
<P>By this Method, the Country Gentlemen may
&s;it at Home; and only Corre&s;ponding with the
Brokers at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s and <HI>Garraway's,</HI> as the Prizes
Ri&s;e or Fall, they may di&s;po&s;e of their Intere&s;ts
in the Towns they can Govern, at as good a
rate as they can.</P>
<P>The Citizens, or &s;uch who have their &s;everal
Companies and Intere&s;t to Serve, will Ea&s;e them|&s;elves
of the Expence of Travelling, with the
fine borrow'd Equipages before mention'd; and
only go to Market in Exchange Alley, and Buy
an Election, as the Stock-Jobber and they &s;hall
agree, which Election &s;hall be manag'd by the
Country Gentleman, who is to have his Bargain,
no Purcha&s;e, no Pay, and is to go thro' with it,
or el&s;e he gets none of the Mony.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Elections of Parliament-Men are in a hopeful
way; and Parliaments them&s;elves, are in a hope|ful
way by this conci&s;e Method of Practice, to
come unde the ab&s;olute Management of a few
Hands, and no doubt things will go on accord|ingly.</P>
<P>Banks
and Stocks may be lay'd up, and em|ploy'd
in a &s;hort time, for the purcha&s;ing the
Intere&s;t of Gentlemen, and our Gentry being
willing to get a Penny in <HI>an Hone&s;t way,</HI> as we &s;ay,
will but too often &s;ell their Intere&s;ts and their
Country too, e&s;pecially &s;uch Gentlemen, who&s;e
E&s;tates are reduc'd to an occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>The truth of it is, 'tis a Paradox, a Riddle,
that we Country-men cannot under&s;tand, nor ne|ver
cou'd, what makes our Gentlemen &s;o fond
of being Parliament Men, we do not very well
under&s;tand what the Bu&s;ine&s;s is at the Parlia|ment.
Only we find we are &s;wingingly Tax'd;
and they tell us 'tis done by the Parliament; but
we never under&s;tood they had any of the Mony
them&s;elves, we always thought the Mony was
for the King, tho' they had the Giving of it,
then we &s;ee in the King's <HI>Proclamation</HI> for Calling
a Parliament, that it was to Advi&s;e with them,
about Affairs of the Highe&s;t Importance to the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Kingdom. Now we cannot &s;ee they can get
any thing by coming together to be Advis'd
with, and our Knights of the Shire tell us they
get nothing by it. And here lies the Difficulty,
we can never reconcile their &s;pending &s;o much
Money to be Cho&s;en, going up 200 Miles to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and &s;pending &s;ix Months &s;ometimes there in at|tending
the Hou&s;e, and all for nothing; we have
often been thinking there mu&s;t be &s;omething el&s;e
in the ca&s;e, and we are afraid there is.</P>
<P>Nor did ever any thing explain this Riddle &s;o
much, as the &s;truggling of the&s;e two Companies
to make Members of Parliament; for the mean|ing
to us &s;eems thus:</P>
<P>That they &s;uppo&s;e which Company &s;o ever
gets mo&s;t Friends in the Hou&s;e, will be mo&s;t
likely to be farther E&s;tabli&s;h'd, to the Ruin of
the other, and therefore they make &s;uch a &s;tir to
get Friends there.</P>
<P>Whence fir&s;t it mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd that the Mat|ter
&s;hall not &s;tand or fall by true Merrit, and that
Company be &s;uppre&s;t that de&s;erves it; for if &s;o,
it might be probable they wou'd both be &s;up|pre&s;t;
for we apprehend they are both de&s;tru|ctive
to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade in general and Manu|factures
in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
But 2. It mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd that Friend&s;hip,
and Number of Voices only will decide the Con|trover&s;y.</P>
<P>And
in order to this the Stock-Jobbers, who
care not a Farthing which Side gets the better,
but makes a Prey of them both, have &s;et up this
new Trade of Jobbing for Elections: And that
the way of their proceeding may be a little plai|ner
under&s;tood, We de&s;ire you to read the Co|py
of a Letter come down la&s;t Po&s;t, to a wor|thy
Gentleman in our Country, from a Friend of
his plying in or near <HI>Exchange-Ally,</HI> concerning

</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom
this Propo&s;al was made, rejected it with Di&s;|dain,
yet the Attempt is made very plain in
the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And we are inform'd, that the Number of
Members come down into the Counties, on &s;uch
accounts, are incredible.</P>
<P>Wherefore we think it very needful to pub|li&s;h
our Re&s;entments at &s;uch a practice, and to
prote&s;t again&s;t it in this our Hone&s;t Plea, as an
indirect, wicked and pernicious Practice, and
which may be of very ill con&s;equence to the Na|tion,
on the&s;e following Accounts,</P>
<P N="1">1. A hundred, or an hundred and fifty &s;uch
Members in the Hou&s;e, wou'd make a Dead
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Weight, as it us'd to be call'd, to carry any Vote
they are For, or Again&s;t, either in the Negative
or Affirmative, as they &s;hall agree, and if &s;o, it
will be almo&s;t in their Power to di&s;po&s;e of our
E&s;tates, Per&s;ons, Liberties and Religion, as they
think fit.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it be true, as is very rational to &s;uppo&s;e,
that they who will Buy will Sell; or if it be true,
which &s;eems &s;till more rational, that they who
have Bought mu&s;t Sell, mu&s;t make a <HI>Penny</HI> of it,
or el&s;e they lo&s;e their <HI>Purcha&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome their
Fortunes, which they expected to rai&s;e by the&s;e
mercenary Elections; then the Influence &s;uch
a Number of Members, gotten into the Hou&s;e
by the method We are &s;peaking of, will be ca|pable
of &s;elling our Trade, our Religion, our
Peace, our Effects, our King, our Crown, and
every thing that is Valluable, or Dear to the
Nation.</P>
<P>If Stock-jobbing of Elections be the fir&s;t &s;tep,
in all probability Stock-jobbing of Votes will be
be the &s;econd; for he that will give a Thou|&s;and
pounds, or more, only for a power to
Vote, expects to get &s;omething by Voting, or
gives away his Money for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
What &s;hall we &s;ay then, if a League of Con|federacy
&s;hou'd be made between our Parlia|ment-Sollicitors,
and our Stock-jobbing-brokers,
two &s;ort of People equally mercenary and de|ceitful.</P>
<P>We
de&s;ire to know, whether 'twould not be
more fatal to <HI>England</HI> than the Union of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> which all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eems to be &s;o much
di&s;turb'd at.</P>
<P>In vain do We the Free-Holders of <HI>England</HI>
&s;trive to Chu&s;e Men of all the Six Characters,
mention'd by a late Author, in order to have a
Parliament every way Quallified for the Impor|tant
Affairs, his Maje&s;ty has mentioned in his
Proclamation.</P>
<P>In vain &s;hall tho&s;e Gentlemen We cho&s;e &s;it,
and Vote in the Hou&s;e, if &s;uch a Generation as
We hear of are let into the Hou&s;e, by the help
of their Money at the Boroughs and Towns, for
the Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es out-run the Knigths in
Number above Three for One.</P>
<P>We think 'tis no &s;mall Misfortune to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Con&s;titution, that &s;o great a Number of
Members Cho&s;en by the Corporations of <HI>England,</HI>
and, according to our weak Opinions, it &s;eems
not equal, That all the Free-holders of a County
<PB N="17" REF="18">
&s;hou'd be repre&s;ented only by two Men, and
the Towns in the &s;ame County be repre&s;ented by
above Forty, as it is in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and near the
like in other Counties.</P>
<P>Again in &s;ome of the&s;e Corporations, where
the right of Voting is in the Mayor and Jurats;
in &s;ome the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Councel; in others the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Capital Burge&s;&s;es; in others the Bayliff and Ju|rats,
and the like, the right of Voting is reduc'd
to &s;o few, and tho&s;e &s;o Mean and Mercenary,
that they are ea&s;ily prevail'd with, to chu&s;e &s;uch
as they know not, but are recommended by o|thers.</P>
<P>And,
which is wor&s;e, &s;ome Towns who&s;e
Charters remain, tho' the Towns them&s;elves &s;eem to
be Dead, are &s;o mean and contemptible, that no|thing
remains of them but a De&s;picable Village,
with the Ruins of what they have been.</P>
<P>We think it wou'd be but rea&s;onable, that the
Charters and Priviledges of Towns, &s;hou'd die
with the Towns; and that whereas when they were
Popolous and Rich, they were Repre&s;ented in
Parliament, becau&s;e they were &s;o; when they
are Depopulated and De&s;olate, there can be no
need of any Per&s;on to repre&s;ent them, what can

the Members, who have &s;erv'd for the Town of
<HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> an&s;wer, if they were ask'd, who they
Repre&s;ent, they mu&s;t An&s;wer they Repre&s;ent
the Ruins and Vaults, the remain of a good
Old Town, now lying in Heaps; as for the
Inhabitants, they are not to be Nam'd among
the Li&s;t of the mo&s;t de&s;picable End&s;hips, or Vil|lage
in the County.</P>
<P><HI>Branber</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> Old <HI>Sarum, Stockbridge, Gat|ton,
Quinburro,</HI> and multitudes of Towns the
like, who &s;end up Gentlemen to repre&s;ent Beg|gars,
and have had more Mony &s;pent at &s;ome of
their Elections, than all the Land in the Pari&s;hes
wou'd be worth, if Sold at a Hundred Years
Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>While on the other Hand, a great many good
Towns in <HI>England,</HI> being of more modern Ri&s;e
in the World, are not permitted to chu&s;e at all,
and the City of <HI>London</HI> it &s;elf, tho' &s;ome &s;ay it
bears a proportion to Six parts of the Kingdom,
&s;ends but Four Members of it &s;elf; and but
Eight in the whole Circumference.</P>
<P>This Inequality, we humbly conceive opens
the Door to the fraudulent practices, which have
all along been made u&s;e of in Elections, Buying
of Voices, giving Freedoms in Corporations, to
People Living out of Corporations, on purpo&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to make Votes, debauching the Electors, make|ing
whole Towns Drunk, and Fea&s;ting them to
Exce&s;s for a Month, &s;ometimes two, or more,
in order to engage their Voices.</P>
<P>The&s;e things were &s;o Notorious, and withal
&s;o Ruinous to the Gentry them&s;elves, of whom
&s;everal Men of plentiful E&s;tates have been mi&s;e|rably
Beggar'd and undone, that the Parliament
wi&s;ely took notice of it, and have prohibited the
practice.</P>
<P>But as if the Devil ow'd the Nation a Grudge,
and was rummaging his Invention to find it out;
here is a new project found out, to &s;ucceed the
other, which is Ten Fold more the Child of Hell
than that.</P>
<P>Elections were obtain'd by tho&s;e Clande&s;tine
Vicious ways, only to &s;it in the Hou&s;e in Ge|neral;
but here the de&s;ign &s;eems to be form'd
before-hand, what they wou'd be cho&s;en for,
and the mea&s;ures concerted, nay we have heard
that it may be known already, and Wagers have
been layd in, or near <HI>Exchange Alley,</HI> which
Company has mo&s;t Friends in the en&s;uing Par|liament,
and how many of the Members of each
Company &s;tand faire&s;t to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen who have Intelligence, &s;uit|able
<PB N="20" REF="21">
to &s;uch nice Calculations, are equally ca|pable
of Jobbing the whole Nation; and as is
already noted, having gotten the way of Buying
and Selling, that is jobbing Elections, will &s;oon
influence &s;uch Per&s;ons to Act, as the Mony they
are able to bid &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be but a melancholly Thought, to
reflect that the matter of our Succe&s;&s;ion, &s;hou'd
come to be debated before a Parliament, that had
a Governing number of &s;uch Members, who cou'd
imagine but that the &s;ettlement of our Crown
wou'd attend the highe&s;t bidder, and our fu|ture
Liberty, Religion, and all that's dear to us,
be Mortgag'd to the Bribes of Forreigners.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King need not keep great Armies
on Foot, Build Ships, and Strengthen him&s;elf
at Sea to Ruin us, if the great Affairs of the
Kingdom concerted in Parliament &s;hou'd come
to be prepar'd, manag'd, and bya&s;s'd at <HI>Garra|way</HI>'s
and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, and expos'd to
Sale by a parcel of Stock-Jobbers.</P>
<P>And how &s;hall it be otherwi&s;e, they that can
make Members, will always Govern Members;
Creation &s;uppo&s;es a Right of di&s;po&s;ing, the Gentle|men
who Buy are Oblig'd to &s;tand in good Terms
with the Broker, lea&s;t they &s;hou'd find a better
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Chapman, and leave him in the lurch the next Ele|ction,
&s;o that by the Nature of the thing, they are
always &s;ubject to this Mercenary, Scandalous
thing, call'd a Broker, and he keeps them under
his Girdle, if he bids them Vote for, or again&s;t,
they do it, the mi&s;chiefs are endles and innumera|ble
that may at tend it.</P>
<P>To all Men who&s;e Eyes are to be open'd with
Rea&s;on and Argument, it &s;hou'd be enough to fill
them with abhorrence, to think that the Scanda|lous
Mechanick Up&s;tart Mi&s;tery of Job-broke|ing
&s;hould grow upon the Nation; that ever
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;hou'd &s;uffer them&s;elves to be
Impos'd upon by the New invented ways of a
few Needy Mercinaries, who can turn all Trade
into a Lottery, and make the <HI>Exchange</HI> a Gaming
Table: A thing, which like the Imaginary Coins
of Foreign Nations, have no reality in them|&s;elves;
but are plac'd as things which &s;tand to be
Calculated, and Reduc'd into Value, a Trade
made up of Sharp and Trick, and manag'd with
Impudence and Banter.</P>
<P>That Six or Eight Men &s;hall Combine toge|ther,
and by pretended Buying or Selling among
them&s;elves, rai&s;e or &s;ink the Stock of the <HI>E. India</HI>
Company, to what extravagant pitch of Price
<PB N="22" REF="23">
they will, &s;o to wheedle others &s;ometimes to
Buy, &s;ometimes to Sell, as their occa&s;ions re|quire;
and with &s;o little regard to Intrin&s;ick
Value, or the circum&s;tances of the Company,
that when the Company has a lo&s;s, Stock &s;hall
Ri&s;e; when a great Sale, or a Rich Ship arriv'd,
it &s;hall Fall: Sometimes run the Stock down to
35<HI>l.</HI> other times up to a 150<HI>l.</HI> and by this Me|thod
Buy and Sell &s;o much, that 'tis thought
there are few of the Noted Stock-jobbers, but what
have bought and &s;old more Stock than both the
Companies po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus let them Jobb, Trick, and Cheat one
another; and let them be bubbl'd by them that
know no better; but for God's &s;ake, Gentlemen,
do not let the Important Affairs of the State
come under their wicked clutches.</P>
<P>Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parlia|ment,
and then Chu&s;e Members to Vote for
them. If Fate and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Confederacies, and Union
of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers abroad threaten us: Let us alone
to &s;truggle with them, and have Fair Law, and
Honourable Conditions for it; but to be Bought
and Sold, to have our Elections of Members, and
our Laws, Liberties and E&s;tates Stock-jobb'd
away, is intollerable.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
Some, and not a few, of our Stock-jobbing
Brokers, are <HI>French</HI> Men, a little Corre&s;pondence
between the <HI>French Court,</HI> and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e,</HI>
with a Currency of <HI>Louis D'ors,</HI> will make
&s;trange alterations here, if this method of Buy|ing
and Jobbing Elections &s;hou'd go on.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> is the Governing
Council; their Breath is our Law, and on their
Breath under the Direction of God's Providence,
we all depend, the greate&s;t Nicety that is po&s;&s;i|ble
&s;hould be us'd in chu&s;ing Men of untainted
Principles, and unque&s;tion'd Wi&s;dom, to com|po&s;e
a Body &s;o Eminent in their Power and In|fluence.</P>
<P>But
to attempt to fill the Hou&s;e with Mecha|nicks,
Trade&s;-men, Stock-jobbers, and Men nei|ther
of Sen&s;e nor Hone&s;ty, is tricking at the
Root, and undermining the Nation's Felicity
at once; and 'tis a wonder the impudence of
this attempt has not made them Stink in the
No&s;trils of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>How can the King be encourag'd to place
that confidence in his People, which he men|tions
in the late <HI>Proclamation,</HI> by which People,
his Maje&s;ty under&s;tands, the true Repre&s;entative
Body A&s;&s;embled in Parliament, if in&s;tead of a
<PB N="24" REF="25">
true Repre&s;entative, the Hou&s;e is fill'd with
Elections Clande&s;tinly procur'd by Tricks and
Shams impos'd upon the People.</P>
<P>How can the King depend upon his Parlia|ment,
to carry him thro' any thing he &s;hall un|dertake
by their advice, if mercenary Men fill
the Hou&s;e, who&s;e Suffrages &s;hall be guided by
the Bribes and private procurations of his, and the
Nations Enemies?</P>
<P>How &s;hall the Prote&s;tant Religion be E&s;pous'd,
and Defended, which wi&s;e Men &s;ay is in great
Danger?</P>
<P>How &s;hall Trade be Encourag'd, and Protec|ted,
and the Niceties of it D&s;puted and Defend|ed?</P>
<P>How
&s;hall Reformation of Manners, which
is &s;o much wanted, and which the King
has &s;o often Recommended, be promoted?</P>
<P>Are Stock-jobbers, Agents of Regiments, Tay|lors,

<P>It
was a Famous Stock-Jobber; and one who
is very likely to be a Parliament Man, who when
&s;ome body was talking lately of the Election of

Que&s;tion at the end ont. Well! &s;ays he, I am
glad 'tis over, and don't you think that <HI>Stock</HI>
will ri&s;e upon't.</P>
<P>A Learned Que&s;tion upon the Ca&s;e, truly;
upon which, pray give us leave to ask ano|ther;
<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="3 words"> And is't not pity, <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="3 words"> 
But &s;uch a one &s;hould Repre&s;ent the City?</P>
<P>You <HI>Londoners</HI> may make them Sheriffs, Al|dermen,

<PB N="26" REF="27">
Men, and welcome; you know them, and they
can hurt no body but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But when you come to talk of Parliament
Men, Gentlemen, pray con&s;ider, 'tis the whole
Nation lies at Stake, a Man may &s;et his own
Hou&s;e on Fire, and welcome, provided it &s;tands
by it &s;elf, and neither hurts nor endangers no
bodies el&s;e, and the Law has nothing to &s;ay to
him; but if it &s;tands in a Town, or a City, he
de&s;erves to be Hang'd, for he may burn out, and
undo his Neighbours.</P>
<P>Nor are you chu&s;ing Men to &s;it in Parlia|ment,
as Per&s;ons to Act for you only whom
they Repre&s;ent; but they are Repre&s;entatives
in a double capacity, &s;eparately con&s;ider'd, every
Member Repre&s;ents the People who chu&s;e him,
and all together Repre&s;ent the whole Nation.
Their right to &s;it is &s;eparately Devolv'd; but
their right in Act, is conjunctively Inherent,
every Man Repre&s;ents the whole, and Acts for
the whole, tho' he is &s;ent but from part.</P>

Admonition or Caution to another, e&s;pecially if
they &s;eem to be proceeding again&s;t their own, or
the Nation's Intere&s;t, they ought to accept the

Hone&s;ty, and reform it.</P>
<P>Upon this, we hope it &s;hall be ju&s;tified, that
we have ventur'd to lay open the Villanous prac|tices

in order to get Members into the en|&s;uing
