<L>We grow more partial for th' ob&s;erver's &s;ake;</L>
<L>To written wi&s;dom, as another's, le&s;s:</L>
<L>Maxims are drawn from notions, tho&s;e from gue&s;s.</L>
<L N="15">There's &s;ome peculiar in each leaf and grain,</L>
<L>Some unmark'd fibre, or &s;ome varying vein:</L>

<L>It may be rea&s;on, but it is not man:</L>

<L>Like following life thro' creatures you di&s;&s;ect,</L>
<L N="30">You lo&s;e it in the moment you detect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more; the diff'rence is as great between</L>
<L>The optics &s;eeing, as the objects &s;een.</L>
<L>All manners take a tincture from our own;</L>
<L>Or come di&s;colour'd thro' our pa&s;&s;ions &s;hown.</L>
<L N="35">Or fancy's beam enlarges, multiplies,</L>

<L>Nor will life's &s;tream for ob&s;ervation &s;tay,</L>

JOHN WARD of Hackney, E&s;q. member of parlia|ment, being pro&s;ecuted by the duche&s;s of Buckingham, and con|victed of forgery, was fir&s;t expelled the hou&s;e, and then &s;tood on the pillory on the 17th of March 1727. He was &s;u&s;pected of joining in a conveyance with Sir John Blunt, to &s;ecrete fifty thou&s;and pounds of that director's e&s;tate, forfeited to the &s;outh-&s;ea com|pany by act of parliament. The company recovered the fifty thou&s;and pounds again&s;t Ward; but he &s;et up prior conveyances of his real e&s;tate to his brother and &s;on, and concealed all his per|&s;onal, which was computed to be one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. The&s;e conveyances being al&s;o &s;et a&s;ide by a bill in Chancery, Ward was impri&s;oned, and hazarded the forfeiture of his life, by not giving in his effects till the la&s;t day, which was that of his examination. During his confinement, his amu&s;ement was to give poi&s;on to dogs and cats, and &s;ee them expire by &s;low|er or quicker torments.

When he was an en&s;ign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next bani&s;hed Bru&s;&s;els, and drum|med out of Ghent on the &s;ame account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming-tables, he took to lending of money at exorbitant intere&s;t and on great penalties, accumulating premium, intere&s;t, and capital into a new capital, and &s;eizing to a minute when the payments became due; in a word, by a con&s;tant attention to the vices, wants, and follies of mankind, he acquired an immen&s;e for|tune. His hou&s;e was a perpetual bawdy-hou&s;e. He was twice con|demned for rapes, and pardoned; but the la&s;t time not without impri&s;onment in Newgate, and large confi&s;cations. He died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The populace at his funeral rai&s;ed a great riot, almo&s;t tore the body out of the coffin, and ca&s;t dead dogs, <HI>etc.</HI> into the grave along with it.
