<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Subject I have here under|taken
is &s;o Nice, and a plain
treating of it &s;o Difficult, &s;o Dan|gerous,
and e&s;pecially in me &s;o
liable to the Cen&s;ures of Prejudices on both
Sides, that it has been with &s;ome He&s;itati|on
that I go about it.</P>
<P>Not that I am &s;o Solicitous of whom I
plea&s;e or di&s;plea&s;e, in my handling this
Nice&punc; Affair; for he that is &s;o, can never
&s;peak with an impartial Freedom; a Liber|ty
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the clear &s;tating
Things of doubtful Acceptation, and a
Liberty which when I cea&s;e to pre&s;erve
to my &s;elf, I &s;hall cea&s;e to write at all.</P>
<P>It is very hard with me in this Ca&s;e,
more than with any other Author; in that,
whereas others are wary in what they
Write, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing the Govern|ment,
and irritating Men in Power; my&punc;
Difficulty is a Clamour rai&s;ed by them, who
without Arrogance I may&punc; &s;ay, cannot
Confute me, pretending that I am too Care|ful
to plea&s;e Men in Power; in which as
<PB N="4" REF="3">
my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aid of his <HI>Whore,</HI> I
have the Scandal without the Joy, the Re|proach
without the Profit of the Charge:
But as the &s;ame Men brought the &s;ame
Charge, when the other Party was in
Power, and thought it as much a Crime,
I appeal to all the World, what heed ought
to be given to their Cen&s;ure; I only intro|duce
this with a brief Challenge to them,
let them find any change of Principle in all
I have written, if they can; and if what I
wrote under the late Mini&s;try and under
this Mini&s;try, agrees, it mu&s;t be &s;ome Bo|dy
el&s;e that has changed Principle, not me,
let the I&s;&s;ue determine it.</P>
<P>I would be glad to plea&s;e every Body;
but my Aim is to &s;peak Truth with Ho|ne&s;ty;
if it plea&s;e no Body, I am not Soli|citous,
&s;o it be but Truth and Hone&s;ty: 
he that can &s;ay it is not, let him &s;tand forth
and be &s;een; he that cannot contradict the
Truth I &s;peak, will have but &s;mall Succe&s;s
in Calumniating the Hone&s;ty with which I
&s;peak it.</P>
<P>And yet I had not entred now upon this
Subject, but that the Writers of the Town
(according to the U&s;age I have &s;ome
Years been treated with) laying all their
Ba&s;tards at my Door, and almo&s;t every
Book being called mine, as well of one
Side as the other, I thought my &s;elf a
<PB N="5" REF="4">
little obliged to declare my &s;elf, and let
you all know my Notions of Things, with
my Name to them, that I may no longer
bear the Scandals of the pre&s;ent Filth of
the Pre&s;s, (with Pardon for that Expre&s;&s;ion.)</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;aid nothing on the Sub|ject,
nor do I purpo&s;e to &s;ay any thing but
what I will fairly own and defend; and
that I hope, may an&s;wer the People who
call every thing they don't like by my
Name.</P>
<P>I am not apt to make Apologies, and I
entreat the Reader to place this Imperti|nence
to the account of the Ages Follies,
which oblige me to it, in Order to Defend
my &s;elf from a Charge &s;o Unju&s;t, as that
of being the Author of Books which I ne|ver
gave my &s;elf the Trouble &s;o much as
to read.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE, (without other En|comiums)
it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay,
merits every Man's Approbati|on,
and tho' the whole Town is
agitated and angry about it; yet
no Man will be found among us, but what
will readily own he is for PEACE.</P>
<P>It would be happy for us all, if we
could talk of Peace with a little more of
it in our Tempers, that we could be at
Peace when we pretend to de&s;ire Peace;
it is to me the &s;trange&s;t Thing in the
World, that we are all falling together by
the Ears, and making War about Peace.
If you talk of one Man, who otherwi&s;e
we lik'd well enough, hang him, he is a
Rogue, he is come over, <HI>he is for Peace.</HI>
The other Side are even with us, and
they talking with this or that Acquain|tance;
who? <HI>Tom...</HI> or <HI>Jack?...</HI> Ay,
He is an Hone&s;t Fellow enough, a good
Natur'd Fellow enough, but he is got in
<PB N="7" REF="6">
with the&s;e furious People, he is all for
Blood, nothing but carrying on the War,
and pu&s;hing all things to Extremities;
Death and De&s;truction are always in his
Mouth, he is Mad if you do but talk of
Peace to him.</P>
<P>Unhappy Nation! What End can the&s;e
Things lead us to? Not a Publick Socie|ty,
not a Coffee-hou&s;e, not a Meeting of
Friends, not a Vi&s;it; but like <HI>Jehu</HI> to <HI>Jeza|bel,
who is on my Side?</HI> Who? Who is
for Peace? Who is for carrying on the
War? Society is converted into Cabal,
all Publick Meetings appear &s;orted into
Committees, or bandyed into Sides as their
Notions of Peace or War encline them.</P>
<P>I cannot but make one brief Ob&s;ervati|on,
which may have &s;ome Philo&s;ophy in
it; and I dare &s;ay it is all natural; the
Note may have its U&s;es in it, which eve|ry
one may improve as they &s;ee fit. When
you find Men &s;itting in a Publick Room,
&s;ay a Coffee-hou&s;e, or Tavern, and talking
of the Publick, Two to One of my Mo|ney,
before you hear a Word they &s;ay that
I tell you at fir&s;t who are for Peace, and
who are for War. The Gentlemen who are
for PEACE, you hear them but at a &s;mall
Di&s;tance, their Voices are low, their Speech
deliberate, their Words are &s;oft, calm; and
&s;poken ea&s;ie like the Subject they &s;peak of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
The other Side that are for War, you
may hear them into the Street, or down
the Stairs, their Voices are Thunder; they
&s;peak the Word War with &s;omething of
the Noi&s;e of War, as if they were giving
in the Field the Word of Command, or
bidding a Platoon give Fire. Again, look
in their Faces, the Men of Peace have it
in their Countenances, their Faces are co|vered
with Smiles, a &s;ort of Calm and
Smoothne&s;s of Temper &s;its on their Brow;
they look plea&s;ed and &s;erence, like the Spi|rit
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them. The Men that
are for War &s;eem in a Ferment, their Eyes
&s;parkle, &s;omething Boi&s;terous appears in
their Faces, they look as unea&s;ie as they
talk, and the aver&s;ion they have to Peace,
&s;hows it &s;elf in their Countenances; &s;ome
cro&s;s Lines &s;eem to be drawn over their
Faces, by which they di&s;cover the Tem|per
they &s;tand in as to the Thing that
they have in Debate.</P>
<P>Well however, come near to the&s;e Gentle|men,
and Argue clo&s;ely with them, and you
&s;hall find them all join in this, that Peace in
its general Acceptation is a Ble&s;&s;ing, which
no Man can have a real &s;tated Aver&s;ion to;
the Off-&s;pring of Heaven, and an Emblem of
Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; no Man can open his
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uth again&s;t Peace, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> nor are the
Gentlemen I am &s;peaking of, who are a|gain&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Peace at this Time, again&s;t it in this
Sen&s;e; let no Man mi&s;take me, I am not
writing a Satyr again&s;t any Body. 'Tis the
unhappy Circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent Na|tional
Temper, <HI>that I am &s;peaking of,</HI> that we
are unea&s;ie to one another, Differing, Di&s;|puting,
Caballing, and &s;ometimes down|right
Quarelling, <HI>and about what?</HI> Not Peace
in General, no, every one is for that; but
the Peace now to be treated of between the
Confederates and the King of <HI>France,</HI> that's
the Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor <HI>to do every one Ju&s;tice</HI> is the Que|&s;tion
among us, whether we &s;hall make
Peace with <HI>France</HI> or no; every Man of
Sen&s;e, every Man of Principle, every Man
that has any knowledg of the Circum|&s;tances
of the Nation, or Concern for its
Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s, wi&s;hes for Peace,
no Man will &s;ay that he is not for Peace;
the very War is made for Peace; it is the
Condition of every Manife&s;to, every De|claration,
all the Alliances, all the Articles
of the Confederacies, which lay down the
Cau&s;es and Beginnings of the War, are full
of it. Peace, Peace; to re&s;tore the Tran|quility
of <HI>Europe,</HI> to re&s;tore the Liberty of
<HI>Europe,</HI> to re&s;tore the Ballance of Power
in <HI>Europe,</HI> the whole War turns upon this
Point. And to be very plain, the Ju&s;tice,
the Honour, and the Reputation of the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Confederacy can be &s;upported, and defend|ed
upon no other Foundation, nothing el&s;e
can ju&s;tifie the Allies for taking up Arms,
neither do they pretend to any other Ju&s;tifi|cation
of it; <HI>the Word is,</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity they
are driven to, there being no other way left
them to obtain Peace. Indeed, no War is
ju&s;t, but what is made for Peace; no|thing
but Peace can make War lawful.
So that Peace being the only thing pre|tended
to in the undertaking this War, for
any Man to &s;ay they do not de&s;ire Peace,
is to &s;ay, they Fight as the Great <HI>Turk</HI>
does, for his Plea&s;ure, for Encrea&s;e of his
Dominions, for Conque&s;t, and the extend|ing
his Power; which is ju&s;t as much to be
Defended as the Pyrates of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> or
as Robbing on the Highway, and no other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>But
to come to the Point, the particular
Objection lies another way; it is not a
Peace in General that our People object
again&s;t, but the Nature and Circum&s;tances
of the Peace; and here we give the <HI>Peace</HI>
an <HI>Epithet,</HI> which requires &s;ome Enquiry
into; A GOOD PEACE, this is the
Di&s;tinction, this alone it is that our whole
Di&s;pute turns upon, and the Expo&s;ition of
the true Meaning, or Acceptation of this
Word, is the Subject of this Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
A GOOD PEACE &s;ay the Objectors
we are all for, but not &s;uch a Peace as you
would have, or as you would make; and
this is the &s;tate of the Ca&s;e. Two Men quar|relling
together in this Town, One a <HI>We&s;t</HI>
Countryman, the other a <HI>North</HI> Country|man;
among &s;ome Scurrility that pa&s;t be|tween
them, &s;ays <HI>We&s;t</HI> to his Antagoni&s;t,
I am no <HI>York&s;hireman;</HI> why, &s;ays <HI>North,
What have you to &s;ay to</HI> York&s;hire? Are
there not a great many Hone&s;t Men in
<HI>York&s;hire?</HI> I would have you know, <HI>There
are as Hone&s;t Men in</HI> York&s;hire, <HI>as in any
Part of</HI> England; Ay, ay, &s;ays <HI>We&s;t,</HI> that
may be true for ought I know; <HI>but that is
called Hone&s;ty in</HI> York&s;hire, <HI>which is not
Hone&s;ty in other Places.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;omething like our Ca&s;e; as one
Sort who are charg'd with being again&s;t
Peace ju&s;tifie them&s;elves, and &s;ay no, we
are not again&s;t Peace, but are for <HI>a
Good Peace</HI> or none. So tho&s;e on the other
Side, who are for Peace &s;ay, they are for
no Peace but <HI>a Good Peace</HI> al&s;o. But the
Ca&s;e will lye very much here, and indeed
only here, whether that is not called a
Good Peace by one Side, which is not
called a Good Peace by the other; and &s;o
we are brought down by both Parties to
the great Enquiry, which is the Subject of
the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"><HI>What is to be under&s;tood, by a GOOD
PEACE?</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uing this Enquiry impartially, it
will come of cour&s;e that we con&s;ider the
Mi&s;takes which People are naturally led in|to
about this Que&s;tion, and the various
Con&s;tructions which the Men of this Day
are plea&s;ed to put upon this Word; which
Con&s;truction varies as Intere&s;t, Party and
Opinion leads them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend Time to enquire how
it comes to pa&s;s, that there are at this
time &s;uch Mi&s;takes, and &s;o many Opini|ons
upon &s;o plain a Que&s;tion; and how a
Nation &s;o clear-&s;ighted as we are, comes
to &s;ee with &s;uch differing Views, put &s;uch
a differing Sen&s;e upon a Word of &s;uch
Con&s;equence at &s;uch a Time as this. For
really the unhappy Breach of Parties a|mong
us, and the Prejudices which con|&s;tantly
attend tho&s;e Party-Divi&s;ions, give
us but too plain a Method how to account
for them: And it mu&s;t be, that Men be|ing
blinded by their Pa&s;&s;ions, and
their Prejudices, are deprived of the clear,
and uninterruped U&s;e of their Judgment,
give their Opinions with partiality, as the
&s;everal Intere&s;ts of the Parties they e&s;|pou&s;e
influence their Judgments.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
To come at a right under&s;tanding of
what we call <HI>a good Peace,</HI> it &s;eems nece&s;&s;a|ry,
with plainne&s;s and freedom, to lay
down a little Hi&s;torically the State of the
War as it re&s;pects <HI>Britain,</HI> and her Allies;
and this I &s;hall do as plainly and briefly as
I can.</P>
<P>After the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> for I &s;hall go
back no farther; the King of <HI>France</HI> hav|ing
recognized King <HI>William,</HI> &s;ettled all the
Reunions, and &s;urrendred to the Confede|rates
what was agreed to be Surrendred;
<HI>Europe</HI> had a plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect of a happy
and a la&s;ting Peace; there was but one
Event which had any thing in it Fatal, or
Threatning to the Tranquility of this Part
of the World, and this was the Death of
<HI>Charles</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain</HI> without I&s;&s;ue;
which tho' it was not then happened, yet
it was probable could not be far off.
However, to prevent the Evil Con&s;equen|ces
which &s;uch an Event might bring up|on
<HI>Europe;</HI> and as the Preamble to the
Treaties of Partition &s;ays to <HI>prevent a new
War:</HI> The Two Kings of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France,</HI> with the States-General, entred in|to
a Convention or Treaty, for bringing
all the Claims, and Preten&s;ions to that Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
to a Ballance, this is the &s;o much
controverted Treaty, called <HI>The Treaty of
Partition;</HI> in the Preamble to which, are
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the following Words relating to what I
am now treating of.</P>
<Q>Be it known to all who &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e Pre|&s;ents,
That the mo&s;t Serene and mo&s;t
Mighty Prince <HI>Lewis XIV. &amp;c.</HI> And
the mo&s;t Serene and mo&s;t Mighty Prince
<HI>William III. &amp;c.</HI> And the States-Gene|ral,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> De&s;iring nothing more Hearti|ly,
than to &s;trengthen by New Engage|ments,
the good Intelligence re-e&s;tabli&s;hed
between them, (<HI>there is keeping up the
Peace they had made</HI>) and to prevent
by Mea&s;ures taken in Time, the Events
that might rai&s;e new Wars in <HI>Europe,</HI>
have to that End, <HI>&amp;c. (There's Safety
again&s;t future Troubles) and &s;o he
goes on to the Articles of the Partiti|on.</HI>
Vide <HI>Treaty,</HI> Page 381.</Q>
<P>After the end of this Tran&s;action, <HI>Europe</HI>
was in a perfect Tranquility, I mean as to
Nations; for as to Peace at Home, God knows
we enjoy'd le&s;s of it than ever. But Hea|ven
healed our needle&s;s Breaches, by ma|king
two real Breaches upon us; and find|ing
the Nation Sick, and Surfeited with the
little Peace we had; he vi&s;ited us with a
New War, and the Death of the King.</P>
<P>The New War began purely on the
<HI>French</HI> &s;ide, who made him&s;elf Agre&s;&s;or by
<PB N="15" REF="14">
two Steps taken in a direct Contravention to
the Solemn Treaties he had made; tho' tho&s;e
Treaties were ratify'd, and exchang'd in
due Form, and &s;o fairly executed, that
<HI>Europe,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>England</HI> entirely di&s;|arm'd,
laid by their Fleets, and broke their
Troops, reducing the E&s;tabli&s;hment of
Forces to the Stint or Limitation of a pro|found
Peace.</P>
<P>The two Steps, <HI>I &s;peak of,</HI> which the
<HI>French</HI> took to break this Peace, were (1.)
The Owning, Declaring, and Compliment|ing
the Pretender by the Stile and Titles due
to King <HI>William,</HI> as King of <HI>England, Scot|land</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Article
in the Treaty of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> by which he had
before acknowledg'd King <HI>William.</HI> (2.) The
other, was the Seizing and Taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, by Virtue of
a Will, or pretended Will of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
to the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> and declaring the &s;aid
Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> King of <HI>Spain, &amp;c.</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
his Agreement and &s;olemn Ratifica|tion
of the Treaty of Partition then in Force.</P>
<P>The&s;e things produced a War as Univer|&s;al
to this Part of <HI>Europe</HI> as ever was engag'd
in; which has now been carry'd on Nine
Year and 6 Months, from <HI>May</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> 1701.
to <HI>Octob.</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> 1711. Of the Succe&s;&s;es
and probable End of which I need not en|large
here, it may come to be &s;poken of
again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
I mu&s;t do his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty
that Ju&s;tice, as to &s;ay, I never &s;aw or heard,
that in all his Manife&s;toes or Declarations
of, or concerning this War, he ever &s;toop'd
to give many Rea&s;ons, why he took either
of the Steps, except only his own Will
and Plea&s;ure, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>&s;o he had thought
fit to do; (viz.)</HI> We have thought fit ra|ther
to accept the &s;aid Gift of the late King
<HI>Charles</HI> to Our &s;aid Grand&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;and
we have thought fit to &s;alute the &s;aid Prince
(meaning the Pretender) by &s;uch and &s;uch
Titles, and the like.</P>
<P>But the more his Maje&s;ty thought fit to
take tho&s;e unccommon Steps, and the le&s;s
Rea&s;on he was plea&s;ed to give for them,
the greater and the ju&s;ter Rea&s;ons they
were, why the Confedetates &s;hould enter
again into that War which was the Con&s;e|quence
of it; and this is evidently taken
hold of in that Sen&s;e by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> in their Re&s;pective Declarations of
War, as follows:</P>
<P>Whereas, in&s;tead of giving the Satisfaction
that ought ju&s;tly to be expected, the <HI>French</HI>
King has added thereunto (<HI>Note, that is, unto
the Seizing the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Monarchy</HI>) a great
Affront and Indignity to US and Our King|doms,
in taking upon him to declare the <HI>Pre|tended
Prince of Wales,</HI> King of <HI>England,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and has al&s;o influenc'd
<HI>Spain</HI> to concur in the &s;ame Affront and Indig|nity;
we find Our Selves obliged for maintain|ing
the Publick Faith for Vindicating the Ho|nour
of Our Crown, and to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs
which all <HI>Europe</HI> is threatned with, <HI>to declare
War,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I recapitulate the&s;e things, becau&s;e from
the&s;e Foundations will be&s;t be inferr'd what
ought to be e&s;teem'd by all the Confe|derates,
A GOOD PEACE; which is bring|ing
it down to the Ca&s;e before me, and of
which I &s;hall &s;peak again in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>France</HI> had <HI>thought fit,</HI>
as above, to take the&s;e two Steps, <HI>Europe</HI>
immediately broke out into a Flame, the
People of <HI>England</HI> re&s;ented in a particular
Manner, the Affront put upon their King, in
the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;etting up a Pretender
again&s;t him, after he had &s;olemnly own'd
his Title, and made Treaties with him as
King; and Addre&s;&s;es flow'd from all Parts
of the Kingdom to the King, expre&s;&s;ing
their Dete&s;tation of that Treatment, and
pre&s;&s;ing His Maje&s;ty to a War.</P>
<P>The other Allies, as much re&s;enting the
King of <HI>France</HI>'s &s;ezing upon the Monar|chy
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;etting up his Grand&s;on
<HI>Philip</HI> V. prepar'd for War al&s;o upon that
Account. Upon the&s;e mutual Grievances,
was form'd the Treaty call'd the <HI>Grand
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Alliance;</HI> in which the particular Demands
of the Allies, without which it is made
Unlawful for them on either Hand, to make
Peace, are particularly &s;tipulated; with
this expre&s;s Condition al&s;o, <Q REND="inline">"That it &s;hall
not be lawful to any of the Confederates
to treat of Peace with the Enemy, without
the mutual A&s;&s;ent and Advice of the re&s;t of
the Confederates."</Q>&mdash;And here again you
may have a &s;tated Foundation for what we
ought to call <HI>a Good Peace.</HI> Nor is there in
any of the&s;e things, any feign'd Con&s;tru|ction,
or forc'd Sen&s;e, by which any one
can be led to make the Terms of Peace,
more or le&s;s: For this, like the Statutes of
a Nation, is the Rule to go by.&mdash;<HI>To the
Law, and to the Te&s;timony,</HI> was the Word of
of Old: To the Grand Alliance, and to the
Declaration of the Rea&s;ons of the War, is

<PB N="19" REF="18">
that the People of this Nation ought
to pay to the Votes, Opinion or Declara|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ions
of the Parliament, which is our

of the Confederacy, I &s;ay, with humble

are already engag'd in.</P>
<P>Thus as it is not in the Power of any of
the Confederates, legally to make Peace,
or treat of Peace, without common Con|&s;ent,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> So neither is it in the Power of
any of the Confederates to impo&s;e farther

is the only obligatory Limitation of Peace
and War.</P>
<P>To explain my &s;elf yet farther, with all
po&s;ible Re&s;pect and Regard to the Confe|derates;
if any one of the Confederates, or
the States or Parliament of their Country
&s;hould Vote or Declare, That no Peace
&s;hould be made with <HI>France,</HI> till &s;uch or
<PB N="20" REF="19">
&s;uch Conditions were obtain'd, were it put|ting
the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy into &s;uch

Conditions are not expre&s;s'd in the Grand
Alliance, I humbly conceive the re&s;t of the
Confederates are not oblig'd by that Vote.</P>
<P>I come &s;till nearer to the Point, for as
I hope, I &s;ay nothing offen&s;ive, &s;o I need
cover it with no Allegory or Similies, for I
hate Di&s;gui&s;es.&mdash;Our Parliament Voted, and
Addre&s;&s;ed, and gave it as their Opinion;
and her Maje&s;ty concurr'd with that Opi|nion,
That no Peace could be Safe and
Honourable, while any Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Monarchy remain'd in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the

<P>But if this is neither expre&s;s'd or imply'd
in the &s;aid Grand Alliance, which is the
Compact and the binding Principle of the
War, I leave it to any impartial Hand to
make out, how far would the&s;e Votes or Ad|dre&s;&s;es
be binding upon the re&s;t of the Con|federates.</P>
<P>This
is to me an unan&s;werable Proof,
that the <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> is the Te&s;t, the
Foundation to judge of the Condition of
the Peace by; and whatever Treaty a|mouns
to, or gives to us, all that is agreed
to be demanded by that Treaty, may be
called A GOOD PEACE, tho' it &s;hould
not come up to the future Opinions of any
&s;et of People what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
From the Votes and Addre&s;&s;es of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, I come to the <HI>late Treaty,</HI>
if it be proper to call it a Treaty, of the
Preliminaries &s;ettled at the <HI>Hague</HI> by Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Torcy,</HI> and the Plenipotentiaries of the
Allies.</P>
<P>If by the&s;e Preliminaries, the Confede|rates
pu&s;h'd <HI>France</HI> to a farther Length than
the Treaty of <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> had concerted,
well and good; my An&s;wer is this,
<Q><P>If the Confederates thought they had
found an Opportunity to gain more of
<HI>France</HI> than they had &s;et as the negative
Bounds of Peace, no Body can blame
them, e&s;pecially if they had obtained it;
I believe every Hone&s;t Man wi&s;hes
with me, they had obtain'd it. <HI>But I will
not &s;ay for this,</HI> that no Peace on le&s;s
Conditions than tho&s;e <HI>Preliminaries,</HI>
provided within the limits declar'd by
the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> would have been
A GOOD PEACE.</P>
<P>As to the Objection which &s;ome make,
<HI>viz.</HI> That by their in&s;i&s;ting on tho&s;e
extraordinary Advantages they lo&s;t all
the re&s;t, and pu&s;h'd the King of <HI>France</HI>
to Extremeties, which made him choo&s;e
to run all Ri&s;ques, rather than com|ply
with them; and that they might
have had as much as the <HI>Grand Alli|ance</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
required, and as much as they
had pretended to one another to make
War for. As to this I &s;ay, they are none
of the Objections I am upon, nor are
they of any U&s;e to the pre&s;ent Pur|po&s;e.</P></Q></P>
<P>The
Que&s;tion before me is, What is the
proper Foundation of A GOOD PEACE
at this time? To which my An&s;wer is, as
before, <HI>The Grand Alliance</HI> is the Te&s;t of <HI>a
Good Peace;</HI> yet as much more as you can,
I will never be the Complainer: But I dare
not &s;ay, that when what is there demand|ed,
can be obtain'd, you have any ju&s;t Rea|&s;on
to carry on the War to obtain more;
at lea&s;t, unle&s;s all the Confederates agree
to do &s;o; for nothing beyond it can be
Obligatory upon the whole.</P>
<P>It remains then, that all which &s;hall be
&s;aid farther relating to a Peace, mu&s;t be a
Comment upon this Text.</P>
<P>There is an Event happened &s;ince the
making that Alliance, which in that Alli|ance
there is no Provi&s;ion made for; and
which, had it been fore&s;een, the Allies no
doubt, would have made &s;ome proper Arti|cle
to have &s;ettled, This is the Death of the
Emperor; and this Accident may give us
Room to enquire, Whether it does not make
&s;ome needful Alterations in the Terms on
which we are to in&s;i&s;t for Peace?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
My An&s;wer is plain, <HI>I wi&s;h &s;ome People
would bear with my plainne&s;s;</HI> I &s;ay it does
not: And here without Fear, or Regard to
Power, or Parties, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ome Things
which I do believe will &s;tartle Man kind a
little in this Ca&s;e; at lea&s;t, if we con&s;ider
the popular Notions which &s;pread among us.</P>
<P>We have been pu&s;h'd on, to &s;et up the
taking <HI>Spain</HI> from King <HI>Philip,</HI> as the
REST or Stay of the Confederates; as
a Thing that we are all ruin'd and undone
without; and the Parliament Vote, Ad|dre&s;s,
and Declare their Opinion, as be|fore,
That <HI>no Peace can be Safe, or Honou|rable
without it.</HI> And yet I mu&s;t tell you,</P>
<P>There is not one Word of Recovering all
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, out of the Hands of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> in all the Grand Al|liance;
&s;o that none of the Confederates
are under any Obligations to go that par|ticular
Length, and not make Peace with|out
it.</P>
<P>My Argument turns upon this Point
then, of which this is the Ab&s;tract:
<Q><P>A Peace may be Honourable, if made
according to the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance;</P>
<P>But the Recovering all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy
from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> is
no part of the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance:</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Therefore a Peace may be Honourable,
tho' &s;ome part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monar|chy
&s;hould remain to the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Bourbon.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>If in this way of Arguing, I am put to
prove the A&s;&s;umption, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>That a Peace
may be Honourable, if made according to the
Tenour of the Grand Alliance;</HI> I make it out
thus: The Grand Alliance is a Conventi|on
of all the Allies, declaring all the Grie|vances
for which they make War, and on
what Terms only they will make Peace.</P>
<P>If all the Rea&s;ons inducing the War are
an&s;wered, and all the Demands upon
which the War is Declar'd are obtain'd,
it can be no longer Ju&s;t to make War;
when it is no longer Ju&s;t to make War, it
is Ju&s;t we &s;hould make Peace; and what|&s;oever
is Ju&s;t in this Ca&s;e, is Honourable.</P>
<P>I return to the Grand Alliance, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
There is not one Word of the Terms of
Peace, which are mentioned in the Ad|dre&s;s
of the Parliament, to be found in the
Grand Alliance.</P>
<P>The Terms of Peace limitted by the
Grand Alliance are the&s;e, and none but the&s;e.</P>

that the &s;aid Part &s;hall never be United,

<P>Thus you have the Royal Authority of
both the&s;e Crown'd Heads, to prove what
I have a&s;&s;erted in the Fir&s;t General.</P>
<P>2. That <HI>alone</HI> can be A GOOD
PEACE wherein the Great Articles
of the Grand Alliance, which were
the Beginning, and are the Founda|tion
of the War, are fully an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>For Evidence of this, we need go no far|ther
than the Grand Alliance it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
The Terms of the Grand Alliance, are the&s;e:</P>
<P>1. <HI REND="blackletterType">That an Equitable and Rea&s;onable Sa|tisfaction
be given to his Imperial
Maje&s;ty, for his Preten&s;ion to the</HI>Spa|ni&s;h <HI REND="blackletterType">Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> Vide Grand Alliance,
<HI>Artic.</HI> 11.</P>
<P><HI>Note, here,</HI> If the Allies had under&s;tood
that the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy had de|volv'd
to him as his Right, let me ask
the&s;e Que&s;tions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Why is it called SATISFACTION
FOR the Succe&s;&s;ion? Why is it not
rather &s;aid, 'Till he be put into POS|SESSION
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy?
It would certainly have been expre&s;s'd
otherwi&s;e, if it had been meant, He
&s;hould ever po&s;&s;e&s;s it <HI>as Emperor.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Why is it call'd his Imperial Maje&s;ty's
<HI>Preten&s;ion to the Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and yet put
into the Hands of his Brother King
<HI>Charles?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I mu&s;t be excus'd making two Remarks
upon this: 1. Satisfaction for the Succe&s;|&s;ion
plainly infers, His Imperial Maje&s;ty
was never under&s;tood to be the Per&s;on that
&s;hould &s;ucceed? It would never el&s;e have
<PB N="35" REF="34">
been called <HI>Satisfaction for it.</HI> This implies an
Equivalent with which he was to be &s;ati&s;|fied
in&s;tead of it, and plainly acknowledges,
that the Confederrates never dreamt of ma|king
an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> to be al&s;o King
of <HI>Spain.</HI> 2. Whereas it is called his Impe|rial
Maje&s;ty's Right of Succe&s;&s;ion, why,
then was it given to King <HI>Charles?</HI> It is
evident, this transferring the Crown by
Gift to King <HI>Charles</HI> III. at the &s;ame time
that we exploded King <HI>Charles</HI> II. devi&s;ing
it by Gift to King <HI>Philip,</HI> was but an odd
Title, and gave &s;uch a Handle to Confirm
<HI>K. Philip</HI>'s Right (his Gift being prior to the
other) as I never yet could &s;ee an&s;wer'd. But
waving that which I have formerly in&s;i&s;ted
on, and which is now no more a Que&s;tion,
the Emperor being dead. This Argu|ment
may be drawn from it, which I be|lieve
can never be an&s;wer'd; That the Em|peror
demitted his Right to his Brother,
becau&s;e it never could be allow'd tolerable,
nor &s;o much as to be thought of, that ever
the Allies would agree, an Emperor of
<HI>Germany</HI> &s;hould have it, as the very &s;ame
Foundation of Exorbitance which they
were then declaring and fighting again&s;t in
the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> then, and the Em|peror
finding that on both Sides, the taking
the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to them&s;elves, would
<PB N="36" REF="35">
not go down with the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> they
re&s;pectively put a Third Per&s;on in the Place.
<HI>Philip,</HI> and <HI>Charles,</HI> and both of them,
claim the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> by Gift, neither
having any real Title.</P>
<P>Fate now has decided the Point on one
Side, for King <HI>Charles</HI> is taken out of the
Contention, and made Emperor.&mdash;Can he
then be King of <HI>Spain?</HI> Certainly, by any
of the former Notions of <HI>Europe,</HI> he can ne|ver
be &s;o received.&mdash;Well, what is next?
Have we any other Branch of the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Au&s;tria</HI> to make a Gift to? If we have, let
us &s;ee him; if we have not, what follows,
but to make &s;uch a Treaty as in which the
Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> may be &s;ecured, and &s;uch
Powers erected as may reciprocally prevent
either the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> or <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI>
overrunning <HI>Europe;</HI> and this I &s;hall call A
GOOD PEACE, let who will find out the
Medium to bring it to pa&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I &s;hall hint from this Ob|&s;evation,
is&mdash;This makes me ea&s;ie, and I
believe, if con&s;ider'd, would make us all
ea&s;ie on the Subject of a Treaty.</P>
<P>Let who will be the Agents, let what
will be the Propo&s;als, the Nature of the
thing is &s;uch, no Party can &s;ugge&s;t that we
&s;hould not have a Regard to <HI>the Balance of
Europe;</HI> no Peace can be treated on, but
upon this Foot: The e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome Rule
<PB N="37" REF="36">
of Power, &s;ome Generals for the Boun|daries
of National Intere&s;t, &s;uch as may li|mit
the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and prevent fu|ture
Encroachments one upon another.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I cannot but think we
&s;hould all be willing to come to talk of
the&s;e things&mdash;Certainly, to Treat of them,
can be of no prejudice; nor can I allow it
to be a good Argument, to &s;ay, That the
<HI>French</HI> always gain upon us by a Treaty.
This is to call all the Confederates Fools,
and &s;ay, they do not know what they
would have; that they make War for they
know not what; that they have Generals
to fight, but no States Men to treat; that
they have Hands, but no Heads; and that
all <HI>Europe</HI> are not able to maintain their Ar|guments
again&s;t Five <HI>French</HI>-Men, Plenipo|tentiaries.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> make Propo&s;als; they would
put by the Way of treating by Prelimina|ries,
and come to a General Treaty at once;
And why &s;hould we not venture them at a
Treaty? We can in&s;i&s;t upon every thing at
a General Treaty, as well as at a particular,
and can &s;tand to all the nece&s;&s;ary Points of
the Grand Alliance, as well there as at an|other
time.</P>
<P>The treating brings us not the nearer;
if <HI>France</HI> does not come up to rea&s;onable
Things, we are where we were. The
<PB N="38" REF="37">
War goes on, nothing is abated of the Vi|gour
of our Armies, or of the needful Pre|parations;
the War indeed may influence
the Treaty: Thus it was at the Treaty of
<HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> which held at lea&s;t Eight Years;
thus it was at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
which la&s;ted Two Campaigns, yet both at
la&s;t came to a Conclu&s;ion, and &s;o may this
perhaps; if it does not, we are never the
farther off of Victory, nor the Enemy ever
the nearer the End they aim at.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore &s;omething wonder|ful
to me, that People &s;hould be allarm'd at
a Propo&s;al to treat; we may treat without
a Peace, but we can never have a Peace
without treating. All that we are allarm'd
at hitherto, is the Sugge&s;tion or Su&s;picion
of a private Treaty; to bring it then to an
open fair <HI>Publick Treaty,</HI> is the mo&s;t effe|ctually
way both to remove the Su&s;pitions
of &s;uch a Treaty on one Hand, and to take
away the Preten&s;ions for it on the other.</P>
<P>Some alledge a Party among us are a|gain&s;t
Peace, are for perpetuating the War,
and have their private Ends in view, to be
pur&s;ued at the Publick Expence. I am in
hopes there are no &s;uch People among us;
however, tho&s;e People oppo&s;ing a Treaty,
give the be&s;t Argument that tho&s;e that
think &s;o can wi&s;h for, to &s;upport that Al|legation;
it is alledged on the other Hand,
<PB N="39" REF="38">
That <HI>Clande&s;tine Negotiations</HI> are on Foot,
and tho&s;e that &s;ay &s;o, fill the People with
Su&s;picions, and Apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch Things
as I hope are not in any One's Head to at|tempt.
<HI>A Treaty</HI> would effectually remove
all tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies, and clear up the Repu|tation
of both Parties.</P>
<P>At a Treaty, all the Allies will be pre|&s;ent
by their Plenipotentiaries, every Thing
will be fully, fairly and openly di&s;cu&s;s'd; if
any Member of the Confederates are ea&s;ier,
and willinger to be impo&s;ed upon than they
ought to be, they will be &s;et to Rights in
Judgment, or over-rul'd in Vote by the o|ther;
if any Member of the Confederacy is
more rigid, or more backward, harder to
be &s;atisfied with Rea&s;on, or forwarder to
continue the War than con&s;i&s;ts with the
General Intere&s;t, he will be reduced to
Rea&s;on by the Per&s;wa&s;ions, or over-rul'd
by the Voices of the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are not &s;o con&s;iderable an E|nemy,
that we &s;hould be afraid to Engage
with them any farther in the War; or &s;o in|con&s;iderable,
that we &s;hould think it below
us <HI>to Treat;</HI> a Treaty takes off all Objecti|ons,
tho' they do not propo&s;e enough to
form <HI>a Good Peace,</HI> yet in a Treaty we may
bring them to it. I can &s;ee many Objecti|ons
again&s;t their Propo&s;als indeed, but I can|not
&s;ee one again&s;t a Treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
In a Treaty a Thou&s;and Things may
occur, and be &s;aid, that may in the End
happily I&s;&s;ue this Great Affair in A GOOD
PEACE; as I &s;aid in the beginning, I find
every one joining in their de&s;ire to have <HI>a
good Peace,</HI> but how &s;hall they obtain it
without a Treaty? A Treaty takes it out
of the Hands of tho&s;e you may &s;u&s;pect, and
puts it into the Hands of the Confederates in
General; if any Conce&s;&s;ions are made to
<HI>France,</HI> which you are afraid of, there they
will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, there they will be examin|ed;
the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies on eve|ry
Side will be watchful, that the Di&s;tributi|on
of the Dominions be not partial and une|qual
to one or to another; that every one
has Ju&s;tice, and that no Advantage be gi|ven
more on one hand than another. The
Plenipotentiaries of all the Parties are Arbi|trators
of every particular Intere&s;t re&s;pe|ctively.</P>
<P>Certainly
a Treaty would end all this
Strife; if the <HI>French</HI> are Sincere in their Of|fers,
and in their Propo&s;als for a General
Peace, it will appear; if they are not,
they will be detected: The Securities they
will offer, will be here di&s;puted, the Vali|dity
of them determined; if they are re|jected,
the Rea&s;ons for rejecting them will
appear; and if we mu&s;t carry on the War
again, the Nece&s;&s;ity will appear; &s;o that
<PB N="41" REF="40">
People will be &s;atisfied with it, and the
more Chearfully bear the Expence. More|over,
the Scandal of de&s;igning to perpetuate
the War will be removed, and every one
will &s;ee for them&s;elves, why the Treaty
broke off, and why the War is carryed on:
If a Peace en&s;ues, it is not the le&s;s likely to
be A GOOD PEACE, for having the
whole Body of the Confederate Mini&s;ters
con&s;enting to it, and coming into it.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine upon what Foot any
one can pretend to be backward to a Treaty,
and I am the freer to put this Notion of
mine in here at this length, becau&s;e I
think it is the only Method to bring the
variety of Opinions now among us, to a
Point; to reconcile us to one another a lit|tle,
and to e&s;tabli&s;h our private Peace, by
putting an end to the pre&s;ent Di&s;putes a|mong
us; a Thing every good man wi&s;hes
for, and a Thing none can deny we ex|treamly
want.</P>
<P>I cannot but think tho&s;e People very
much mi&s;taken, both on one Side or other,
who oppo&s;e a Treaty; <HI>&s;ome &s;ay</HI> a Treaty
will be to no Purpo&s;e, and will but amu&s;e
us, and all <HI>Europe;</HI> that it is plain, the Con|federates
will in&s;i&s;t on the Surrendring all
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI>
and that the <HI>French</HI> will not part with
<PB N="42" REF="41">
it, and therefore the War mu&s;t go on, till
the <HI>French</HI> find them&s;elves in &s;uch Circum|&s;tances
as to be obliged to quit that &s;weet
Mor&s;el to &s;ave the re&s;t: That a Treaty
in the mean time is but amu&s;ing us, and is
a particular Service to the King of <HI>France,</HI>
as it buoys up his People in hopes of a Peace,
and urges them to exert their utmo&s;t for a|while
longer, upon a pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy
I&s;&s;ue of all their Troubles. On the other
Hand, &s;ome &s;ay a Treaty is de&s;ign'd only
to bring the Confederates into &s;ome Confu|&s;ion
about the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; and that
&s;ome appearing le&s;s tenacious on that Head
than others, will make them Jealous of one
another, divide them in Opinion; and
that the <HI>French</HI> have more Room in a Trea|ty
to lay hold of, and make Advantages
from tho&s;e Differences; and &s;o a Treaty
may be a Means to de&s;troy the good Har|mony
of the Confederates, rather than to
i&s;&s;ue in <HI>a good Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the Fir&s;t,</HI> It &s;eems to have no &s;trength
of Rea&s;oning at all in it; 'tis begging the Que|&s;tion,
to &s;ay the Confederates will in&s;i&s;t upon
the evacuating the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Domi|nions
to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> it is evident,
as before the Confederates did appear en|clin'd
at the la&s;t Treaty, to yield &s;ome
Point to <HI>France,</HI> and to allow King <HI>Philip</HI> to
<PB N="43" REF="42">
keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome part of that Monar|chy,
rather than continue the De&s;olations
of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this, when there was a
di&s;tinct Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria</HI> to
po&s;&s;e&s;s the re&s;t; it &s;eems probable they may
be enclin'd to make larger Conce&s;&s;ions
now. The Con&s;ideration of <HI>Europe</HI>'s De&s;ola|tions
being as &s;trong as before, and the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> having now but one
Head to receive the re&s;t; to which Head
there cannot be equal Rea&s;on for giving
the re&s;t, to what there was before; and
of which Head there may be &s;o many ju&s;t
Fears of the Danger of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it&mdash;|The
Notion then of the Confederates be|ing
re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t po&s;itively upon the
Evacuation of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy with|out
any Re&s;erve, is not well grounded,
and therefore not a ju&s;t way of Argu|ing.</P>
<P>As
to a Treaty being a Help to <HI>France,</HI> as
it buoys up the Spirits of his People; by &s;o
much as he reaps an Advantage by that Mo|mentary,
Imaginary Aid&mdash;by &s;o much, if it
fails, will he &s;uffer then in the De&s;pair he will
find his People reduc'd to, when they &s;hall
&s;ee tho&s;e Hopes vani&s;h, and that their
Mi&s;eries are like &s;till to be continued by
the Ob&s;tinacy of their King, in hazarding
their Ruine, to pre&s;erve not them&s;elves
<PB N="44" REF="43">
as <HI>France,</HI> but the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, by which they can pro|po&s;e
to receive little or no Benefit when it
is obtain'd, and will be expos'd to the ut|mo&s;t
De&s;olation in the Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>This Digre&s;&s;ion brings me back to the
Notion of the Confederates upon &s;uch a
Treaty, making Conce&s;&s;ions to <HI>France</HI> of
&s;ome Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy&mdash;And

<P>This Point mu&s;t be clear'd up as we go,

<P><HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has &s;et up <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>An|jou,</HI>
upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne, and has fought
hard to keep him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; in Gratitude
<PB N="49" REF="48">
and Duty to his Grand-father, I doubt not but
<HI>Philip</HI> V. would on all Occa&s;ions do any thing
for his Grand-father that lay in his Power;
but if now after a Peace &s;hould be made (&s;up|po&s;ing,
for Argument &s;ake, that Peace were to
give <HI>Spain</HI> to King <HI>Philip;</HI>) let us bring in the
King of <HI>France</HI> writing &s;uch a Letter as this to
his Grand&s;on.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mon&s;. My Grand&s;on,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have &s;et you up upon the <HI>Spani&s;h Throne,</HI>
and cau&s;ed you to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd in that Kingdoms
by all the Confederates in a General Treaty of Peace. But,
as my De&s;ign in &s;etting you up, was only to
annex the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to my Kingdom of
<HI>France;</HI> &s;o I expect that now you will re&s;ign all
tho&s;e Dominions to Me, and come hither to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI>
where you &s;hall be receiv'd with all Paternal Care
and Affection.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>LOUIS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Will any Man &s;ay that <HI>Philip</HI> will immedi|ately
Obey, re&s;ign his Crown and Kingdom,
to the King of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he is his Grand-father,
or had been his immediate Father, or
were a thou&s;and times nearer, if that could
be?</P>
<P>Would not King <HI>Philip</HI> rather write a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
Letter to him, acknowledging his Fa|vour
in preferring him to &s;o great a Dignity,
and his Kindne&s;s in maintaining him therein
unto a General Peace; profe&s;&s;ing his Zeal
for his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, and his Readine&s;s
to hazard him&s;elf, and all his Kingdoms in his
Maje&s;ties Service; But that he is now &s;o en|dear'd
to his Subjects, who&s;e Fidelity has
<PB N="50" REF="49">
been &s;o manife&s;t, and they are &s;o endear'd to
him that he is become the Father of his Peo|ple&punc;
and that he hopes his Grand-father will
not put him to &s;uch an Extremity to quit
tho&s;e Kingdoms, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation, who
have &s;pent &s;o much Blood to keep him in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and &s;o in &s;hort Excu&s;e him&s;elf, <HI>that is,</HI>
make a Decent Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>If upon this, the King of <HI>France,</HI> went about
to Invade him, Would he not &s;ay to him, that
his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Subjects would by no means con&s;ent
to his Abandoning them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they
are re&s;oly'd to defend them&s;elves; and would
he not rather fight his Grand-father, after all
he has done for him, than quit his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?
And I am &s;ure you will all &s;ay, he would be
in the right to do &s;o&mdash;And what would be
the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Fighting? but that
very King <HI>Philip</HI> joining with the Allies, and
&s;eeking to them for help again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And if this would be &s;o under his Grand-father,
let any Man tell us what it would pro|bably
be in half an Age after to his Elder
Brother, if he <HI>being King of France,</HI> &s;hould
make &s;uch a Demand? Would not he, <HI>Philip,</HI>
Laugh at him, and bid him do his wor&s;t; and
in both Ca&s;es, fly to the Confederates, <HI>viz.</HI>
to <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and to the <HI>Empire</HI> for help?</P>
<P>This is &s;o Natural and &s;o unan&s;werably Ju&s;t
to &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;That let the&s;e People but make
it out, that this is the King of <HI>France</HI>'s De&s;ign,
and that he is only making a Shew of King
<HI>Philip,</HI> but really re&s;olves to annex <HI>Spain</HI> to the
Kingdom of <HI>France;</HI> I &s;ay, let them but make
<PB N="51" REF="50">
this good; and they have brought on the
Stage the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;on that ever was yet
given, or ever will be, why all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Monarchy &s;hould be given to King <HI>Philip,</HI>
and I Challenge them to An&s;wer it if they
can.</P>
<P>Let any one but en&s;ure the Confederates,
that the King of <HI>France</HI> will endeavour to
annex <HI>Spain</HI> to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> after a
Peace; I dare &s;ay, none of the Confederates
would &s;cruple leaving King <HI>Philip</HI> upon that
Throne&mdash;But this is &s;o wild a Notion, that
I think it Merits to have no more Notice
taken of it.</P>
<P>Two things this Di&s;cour&s;e tends to: 1. To
remove that Notion, gotten among us, that
all is Lo&s;t and Given up, if King <HI>Philip</HI>
is not entirely Depos'd and Un-king'd, and
the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy taken out of his
Hands by the Confederates; a thing, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, however I acquie&s;ce in the Opinion of
our Superiors, I never &s;aw either Rational
to be &s;o &s;trictly limited, or po&s;&s;ible to be
brought to Practi&s;e; and a thing which tho&s;e
who adher'd to, yet tacitly own'd them&s;elves
wrong in, by keeping the Hou&s;es, by &s;hort
Adjournments, ju&s;t at Hand, to alter as they &s;aw
Occa&s;ion. 2. To Allarm us, and that with great,
Rea&s;on too, to Con&s;ider, Suppo&s;e we could take
it from King <HI>Philip;</HI> What the Danger of
giving it now to the &s;ame Per&s;on to whom
we would have given it before, will be; and
La&s;tly, To Convince us all, how rea&s;onable
it is that the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould in ge|neral
<PB N="52" REF="51">
Congre&s;s, Meet, Treat and Debate, of
the&s;e great Affairs, that if po&s;&s;ible, out of all
tho&s;e Interfering Intere&s;ts, &s;ome Happy Me|dium
may be found to Re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Tran|quility
of <HI>Europe</HI> in a GOOD PEACE.</P>
