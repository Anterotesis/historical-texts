<HEAD><HI>Augu&s;ta Triumphans:</HI>
OR, THE
WAY
TO MAKE
<HI>LONDON</HI>
The mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing
CITY in the Univer&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>_A Man who has the Publick Good
in View, ought not in the lea&s;t to
be alarm'd at the tribute of Ridi|cule
which Scoffers con&s;tantly
pay to projecting Heads: It is the Bu&s;ine&s;s
of a Writer, who means well, to go direct|ly
forward, without regard to Critici&s;m,
but to offer his Thoughts as they occur; and
if in twenty Schemes, he hits but on one to
the Purpo&s;e, he ought to be excu&s;ed fail|ing
in the Nineteen for the Twentieth
Sake. 'Tis a kind of good Action to
mean well, and the Intention ought to pal|liate
the Failure, but the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> of all
People in the World, &s;how lea&s;t Mercy to
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Schemi&s;ts, for they treat them in the vi|le&s;t
manner; whereas other Nations give
them fair Play for their Lives, which is
the rea&s;on why we are e&s;teem'd &s;o bad at
Invention.</P>
<P>I have but a &s;hort Time to live, nor
would I wa&s;te my remaining Thread of
Life in Vain, but having often lamented
&s;undry Publick Abu&s;es, and many Schemes
having occur'd to my Fancy, which to me
carried an Air of Benefit; I was re&s;olv'd to
commit them to Paper before my Departure,
and leave, at lea&s;t, a Te&s;timony of my good
Will to my Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>But of all my Reflections, none was more
con&s;tantly my Companion than a deep Sor|row
for the pre&s;ent decay of Learning a|mong
us, and the manife&s;t Corruption of
Education; we have been a brave and learned
People, and are in&s;en&s;ibly dwindling into
an Effeminate, Superficial Race: Our young
Gentlemen are &s;ent to the Univer&s;ities 'tis
true, but not under Re&s;traint or Cor|rection
as formerly; not to &s;tudy, but to
drink; not for Furniture for the Head, but
a Feather for the Cap, merely to &s;ay they
have been at <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as if
the Air of tho&s;e Places in&s;pir'd Knowledge
without Application. 'Tis true, we ought
to have tho&s;e Places in Reverence for the
many learned Men they have &s;ent us; but
why mu&s;t we go &s;o far for Knowledge?
<PB N="5" REF="4">
why &s;hould a young Gentleman be &s;ent raw
from the Nur&s;ery to live on his own Hands,
to be liable to a thou&s;and Temptations, and
run the Ri&s;que of being &s;napt up by &s;harp|ing
Jilts, with which both Univer&s;ities a|bound,
who make our Youth of Fortune
their Prey, and have brought Mi&s;ery into
too many good Families? Not only the Ha|zard
of their Healths from Debauches of
both Kinds, but the wa&s;te of their precious
Time renders the &s;ending them &s;o far off
very hazardous. Why &s;hould &s;uch a Me|tropolis
as <HI>London</HI> be without an Univer&s;i|ty?
Would it not &s;ave con&s;iderably the Ex|pence
we are at in &s;ending our young Gen|tlemen
&s;o far from <HI>London?</HI> Would it not
add to the Lu&s;tre of our State, and culti|vate
Politene&s;s among us? What Benefits
may we not in time expect from &s;o glori|ous
a De&s;ign? Will not <HI>London</HI> become
the Scene of Science? And what rea&s;on have
we but to hope we may vye with any Neigh|bouring
Nations? Not that I would have
<HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI> neglected, for the
Good they have done: Be&s;ides, there are
too many fine Endowments to be &s;unk, we
may have Univer&s;ities at tho&s;e Places, and
at <HI>London</HI> too, without Prejudice. Know|ledge
will never hurt us, and whoever lives
to &s;ee an Univer&s;ity here, will find it give
quite another turn to the Genius and Spi|rit
of our Youth in general.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
How many Gentlemen pa&s;s their Lives in
a &s;hameful Indolence, who might employ
them&s;elves to the purpo&s;e, were &s;uch a De|&s;ign
&s;et on foot? Learning would flouri&s;h,
Art revive, and not only tho&s;e who &s;tudy'd
would benefit by it; but the Ble&s;&s;ing would
be convey'd to others by Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And in order to this &s;o laudable de&s;ign,
&s;mall Expence is required: The &s;ole Charge
being the hire of a convenient Hall or
Hou&s;e, which if they plea&s;e, they may call
a College. But I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity the Pu|pils
have to lye or diet there; that may be
done more rea&s;onably and conveniently at
home, under the Eye of their Friends:
Their only nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s at College be|ing
to attend their Tutors at &s;tated Hours,
and (Bed and Board excepted) to conform
them&s;elves to College Laws, and perform
the &s;ame Exerci&s;es as if they were actually
at <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Let the be&s;t of Tutors be provided, and
Profe&s;&s;ors in all Faculties encouraged, this
will do a double good, not only to the In|&s;tructed,
but to the In&s;tructors. What a
fine Provi&s;ion may here be made for Num|bers
of ingenious Gentlemen, now unpre|ferr'd?
And to what a heighth may even a
&s;mall Beginning grow in time?</P>
<P>As <HI>London</HI> is &s;o exten&s;ive, &s;o its Uni|ver&s;ity
may be compos'd of many Colleges,
quarter'd at convenient Di&s;tances; for Ex|ample,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
one at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> one at St.
<HI>James</HI>'s, one near <HI>Ormond Street;</HI> (that
part of the Town abounding in Gentry)
one in the Centre of the Inns of Court;
another near the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> and
more if Occa&s;ion and Encouragement
permit.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Offices and Regulations may
be con&s;tituted, Cooks, Butlers, Bed-ma|kers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> excepted, as at other Univer&s;i|ties.
As for Endowment, there is no need,
the whole may be done by Sub&s;cription;
and that an ea&s;y one; con&s;idering nothing
but In&s;tructions are paid for.</P>
<P>In a Word, an Academical Education
is &s;o much wanted in <HI>London,</HI> that every
Body of Ability and Figure, will readily
come into it; and I dare engage the Place
need but be cho&s;en, and Tutors appro|ved
of, to compleat the De&s;ign at once.</P>
<P>It may be objected that there is a kind
of Univer&s;ity at <HI>Gre&s;ham-College,</HI> where
Profe&s;&s;ors in all Sciences are maintained and
obliged to read Lectures every Day, or at
lea&s;t as often as demanded. The De&s;ign is
mo&s;t laudable, but it &s;mells too much of
the <HI>Sine Cure;</HI> they only read in Term-Time,
and then their Lectures are &s;o hur|ried
over, the Audience is little the better.
They cannot be turn'd out; 'tis a good Set|tlement
for Life, and they are very ea&s;y in
their Studies when once fix'd. Whereas
<PB N="8" REF="7">
were the Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, during good Beha|viour,
there would be a Study to maintain
their Po&s;ts, and their Pupils would reap
the Benefit.</P>
<P>Upon &s;econd Thought, I think Colleges
for Univer&s;ity Education, might be formed
at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, Eaton,</HI> the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
St. <HI>Pauls, Merchant-Taylors,</HI> and other
Publick Schools, where Youth might begin
and end their Studies; but this may be far|ther
con&s;ider'd of.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot the mo&s;t material
Point, which is, that his Maje&s;ty's Sanction
mu&s;t fir&s;t be obtain'd, and the Univer&s;ity
propos'd have Power to confer Degrees,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and other Academical Priviledges.</P>
<P>As I am quick to conceive, I am eager
to have done, unwilling to overwork a Sub|ject;
I had rather leave part to the Concep|tion
of the Readers, than to tire them or
my Self with protracting a Theme; as if
like a Chancery Man, or a Hackney Au|thor,
I wrote by the Sheet for hire: So
let us have done with this Topick, and
proceed to another; which is,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HEAD>A Propo&s;al to prevent Murder, Di&s;ho|nour,
and other Abu&s;es, by erecting an
<HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> for Foundlings.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to run into a Declamati|on
on this Head, &s;ince not a Se&s;&s;ions
pa&s;&s;es, but we &s;ee one or more mercile&s;s
Mothers try'd for the Murder of their Ba|&s;tard-Children;
and to the Shame of good
Government, generally e&s;cape the Venge|ance
due to &s;hedders of Innocent Blood:
For 'tis a common Practice now among
them, to hire a &s;et of Old-Bedlams, or pre|tended
Midwives, who make it their Trade
to bring them off for three or four Guineas,
having got the ready rote of &s;wearing the
Child was not at its full Growth, for which
they have a hidden Re&s;erve, that is to &s;ay,
the Child was not at Man's or Woman's
Growth. Thus do the&s;e impious Wretches
cheat the World, and damn their own Souls
by a double Meaning, which too often im|po&s;es
on a cautious, merciful and credu|lous
Jury, and gives wicked Murderers
means to e&s;cape and commit fre&s;h Sins,
to which their Acquitters no doubt are
acce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I wonder &s;o many Men of Sen&s;e, as have
been on the Jury, have been &s;o often im|pos'd
<PB N="10" REF="9">
upon by the &s;tale Pretence of a Scrap
or two of Child-Bed Linnen being found
in the Murderer's Box, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when alas!
perhaps it was ne'er put there till after the
Murder was committed; or if it was, but
with a view of &s;aving them&s;elves by that
devili&s;h Precaution; for &s;o many have been
acquitted on that Pretence, that 'tis but too
common a Thing to provide Child-Bed-Linnen
before-hand for a poor Innocent
Babe they are determin'd to murder.</P>
<P>But alas! What are the exploded Mur|ders
to tho&s;e which e&s;cape the Eye of the
Magi&s;trate, and dye in Silence? Add to
this procur'd Abortions, and other in|direct
means, which wicked Wretchesmake
u&s;e off to &s;creen them&s;elves from the Cen|&s;ure
of the World, which they dread more
than the Di&s;plea&s;ure of their Maker.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who cannot be &s;o hard-hearted
to murder their own Offspring them&s;elves,
take a &s;lower, tho' as &s;ure a way, and get
it done by others, by dropping their Chil|dren,
and leaving them to be &s;tarved by
Pari&s;h-Nur&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus is God robb'd of a Creature, in
whom he had breath'd the Breath of Life,
and on whom he had &s;tamp'd his Image;
the World of an Inhabitant, who might
have been of u&s;e; the King of a Subject;
and future Generations of an I&s;&s;ue not to be
accounted for, had this Infant lived to have
been a Parent.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
It is therefore the height of Charity and
Humanity, to provide again&s;t this Barba|rity,
to prevent this crying Sin, and ex|tract
Good, even out of Evil, by &s;aving
the&s;e Innocent Babes from Slaughter, and
bringing them up in the Nurture and Fear
of the Lord; to be of Benefit to them&s;elves
and Mankind in General.</P>
<P>And what nearer, what better way can
we have, than to erect and endow a pro|per.
Ho&s;pital or Hou&s;e to receive them,
where we may &s;ee them tenderly brought
up, as &s;o many living Monuments of our
Charity; every one of them being a con|vincing
Proof of a Chri&s;tian &s;aved, and a
Murder prevented?</P>
<P>Nor will this be attended with &s;o much
Charge as is imagin'd, for we find in many
Pari&s;hes, that Parents have re-demanded
their Children, on encrea&s;e of Circum&s;tan|ces,
and paid all Co&s;ts with a hand&s;ome
Pre&s;ent in the Bargain; and many Times
when a Clande&s;tine Marriage is clear'd up,
and openly avow'd, they would purcha&s;e
the Fir&s;t-Fruits of their Loves at any Rate:
Oftentimes a Couple may have no more
Children, and an Infant thus &s;av'd, may
arrive to inherit a good E&s;tate, and become
a Benefactor, where it was once an Object
of Charity.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e the wor&s;t, and ima|gine
the Infant begot in Sin and without
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Sanction of Wedlock; is it therefore to
be murder'd, &s;tarv'd or neglected, becau&s;e
its Parents were wicked? hard Fate of
innocent Children, to &s;uffer for their Pa|rents
Faults! Where God has thought fit
to give his Image and Life, there is Nou|ri&s;hment
demanded; that calls aloud for
our Chri&s;tian and Human A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
be&s;t &s;hows our Noblene&s;s of Soul, when we
generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who cannot help
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If the Fault devolv'd on the Children,
our Church would deny them Bapti&s;m,
Burial, and other Chri&s;tian Rites; but our
Religion carries more Charity with it, they
are not deny'd even to partake of our Ble&s;|&s;ed
Sacraments, and are excluded no
one Branch or Benefit accruing from Chri|&s;tianity;
if &s;o, how unju&s;t are tho&s;e who
arraign 'em for their Parents Faults, and
how barbarous are tho&s;e Parents, who, tho'
able, make no Provi&s;ion for them, becau&s;e
they are not Legitimate: My Child, is my
Child, let it be begot in Sin or Wedlock,
and all the Duties of a Parent are incum|bent
on me &s;o long as it lives; if it &s;ur|vives
me, I ought to make a Provi&s;ion for
it, according to my Ability; and tho' I do
not &s;et it on a Footing with my Legiti|mate
Children, I ought in Con&s;cience, to
provide again&s;t Want and Shame, or I am
an&s;werable for every Sin or Extravagance
<PB N="13" REF="12">
my Child is forc'd or led into, for want
of my giving an Allowance to prevent it.</P>
<P>We have an In&s;tance very fre&s;h, in every
ones Memory, of an ingenious, nay, a &s;ober
young Nobleman, for &s;uch I mu&s;t call him,
who&s;e either Father was a Peer, and his
Mother a Peere&s;s: This unhappy Gentleman
to&s;s'd from Father to Father, at la&s;t found
none, and him&s;elf a Vagabond, forced to
every Shift; he in a manner &s;tarved for ma|ny
Years, yet was guilty of no Capital
Crime, till that unhappy Accident occur'd,
which God has given him Grace, and
Sen&s;e enough-to repent: However, I can|not
but think his hard-hearted Mother
will bear her Portion of the Guilt, till
wa&s;h'd away by a &s;evere Repentance.</P>
<P>What a Figure might this Man have
made in Life, had due Care been taken? If
his Peerage had not been adju&s;ted, he might
at lea&s;t have been a fine Gentleman; nay
probably, have fill'd &s;ome hand&s;ome Po&s;t
in the Government with Applau&s;e, and
call'd as much for Re&s;pect, as he does now
for Pity.</P>
<P>Nor is this Gentleman the only Per&s;on
begot, and neglected by Noble, or rather
Ignoble Parents; we have but too many now
living, who owe their Birth to the be&s;t of our
Peerage, and yet know not where to eat.
Hard Fate, when the Child would be glad
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the Scraps, which the Servants throw a|way!
but Heaven generally rewards them
accordingly, for many Noble Families
are become Extinct, and large E&s;tates ali|enated
into other Hou&s;es, while their own
I&s;&s;ue want Bread.</P>
<P>And now, methinks, I hear &s;ome over|&s;queami&s;h
Ladies cry, <HI>what would this
Fellow be at? would not he &s;et up a
Nur&s;ery for Lewdne&s;s, and encourage
Fornication? who would be afraid of &s;in|ning,
if they can &s;o ea&s;ily get rid of their
Ba&s;tards? we &s;hall &s;oon be over-run with</HI>
Foundlings <HI>when there is &s;uch Encourage|ment
given to</HI> Whoredom: To which I an|&s;wer,
that I am as much again&s;t Ba&s;tards
being begot, as I am for their being mur|der'd;
but when a Child is once begot,
it cannot be unbegotten; and when once
born it mu&s;t be kept; the Fault, as I &s;aid
before, is in the Parents, not the Child;
and we ought to &s;hew our Charity towards
it as a Fellow-Creature and Chri&s;tian,
without any regard to its Legitimacy or
otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The only way to put a &s;top to this grow|ing
Evil, would be to oblige all Hou&s;e|keepers,
not to admit a Man and Woman
as Lodgers, till they were certify'd of their
being lawfully marry'd; for now-a-Days
nothing is more common than for a Whore-monger
and a Strumpet to pretend Mar|riage,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
till they have left a Child or two
on the Pari&s;h, and then &s;hift to another
end of the Town.</P>
<P>If there were no Receivers there would
be no Thieves: If there were no Bawdy-Hou&s;es
there would be no Whores; and
though Per&s;ons letting Lodgings be not
actual Procurers, yet, if they connive at
the Embraces of a Couple, who&s;e Mar|riage
is doubtful, they are no better than
Bawds, and their Hou&s;es no more than
Brothels.</P>
<P>Now &s;hould any Body ask, how &s;hall
this Ho&s;pital be Built? how endow'd?
to which I an&s;wer, follow the Steps of the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Hamburgers,</HI> and other fo|reign
States, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have for Ages pa&s;t
pro&s;ecuted this glorious De&s;ign, and found
their Account therein: As for building a
Hou&s;e I am utterly again&s;t it, e&s;pecially in
the Infancy of the Affair: Let a Place con|venient
be hir'd: Why &s;hould &s;uch a con|&s;iderable
Sum be &s;unk in building as has in
late publick Structures, which have &s;wal|low'd
up part of the Profits and Dividend, if
not the Capital, of unwary Stock-mongers?</P>
<P>To my great Joy I find my Project al|ready
anticipated, and a noble Sub&s;cription
carrying on for this purpo&s;e; to promote
which, I exhort all Per&s;ons of Compa&s;&s;ion
and Genero&s;ity, and &s;hall think my &s;elf

the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> properly be call'd an Aca|demy,
when none are admitted but &s;uch as
are, at lea&s;t are thought, or ought to
<PB N="18" REF="17">
be, adepts in Mu&s;ick? If that be an Aca|demy,
&s;o are the Theatres of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI>
and <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</HI> Nay, <HI>Punch</HI>'s
<HI>Opera</HI> may pa&s;s for a lower kind of Aca|demy.
Would it not be a glorious thing
to have an <HI>Opera</HI> of our own, in our own
mo&s;t noble Tongue, in which the Com|po&s;er,
Singers, and Orche&s;tre, &s;hould be
of our own Growth? Not that we ought
to di&s;claim all Obligations to <HI>Italy,</HI> the
Mother of Mu&s;ick, the Nur&s;e of <HI>Corelli,
Handel, Bononcini,</HI> and <HI>Geminiani;</HI> but
then we ought not to be &s;o &s;tupidly
partial, to imagine our Selves too Brutal
a part of Mankind, to make any Progre&s;s
in the Science: By the &s;ame rea&s;on that we
love it, we may excel in it; Love begets
Application, and Application Perfection.
We have already had a <HI>Purcel,</HI> and no
doubt, there are now many latent Genius's,
who only want proper In&s;truction, Appli|cation,
and ENCOURAGEMENT, to become
great Ornaments of the Science, and make
<HI>England</HI> emulate even <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>What a number of excellent Performers
on all In&s;truments, have &s;prung up in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
within the&s;e few Years? that this is
owing to the <HI>Opera,</HI> I will not deny, and
&s;o far the <HI>Opera</HI> is an Academy, as it re|fines
the Ta&s;te, and in&s;pires Emulation.</P>
<P>But tho' we are happy in In&s;trumental
Performers, we frequently &s;end to <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
for Singers, and that at no &s;mall Ex|pence:
To remedy which, I humbly pro|po&s;e,
that the Governours of <HI>Chri&s;t's-Ho&s;|pital</HI>
will &s;how their publick Spirit, by
forming an Academy of Mu&s;ick on their
Foundation, after this or the like man|ner.</P>
<P>That
out of their great number of Chil|dren,
thirty Boys be &s;elected, of good Ears
and Propen&s;ity to Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Boys be divided into three
Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> Six for Wind-In&s;truments,
&s;uch as the Hautboy, Ba&s;&s;oon, and Ger|man-Flute.</P>
<P>That
&s;ixteen others be &s;elected for String-In&s;truments,
or at lea&s;t the mo&s;t u&s;eful, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Violin and Ba&s;s-Violin.</P>
<P>That the remaining eight be particu|larly
cho&s;en for Voice, and Organ, or
Harp&s;ichord. That all in due time, be
taught Compo&s;ition. The Boys thus cho|&s;en,
three Ma&s;ters &s;hould be elected, each
mo&s;t excellent in his Way; that is to &s;ay,
one for the Wind-In&s;trument, another for
the String'd, and a third for the Voice and
Organ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hand&s;ome Salaries &s;hould be allowed
the&s;e Ma&s;ters, to engage their con&s;tant At|tendance
every Day, from eight till twelve
in the Morning; and I think a 100<HI>l.
per Annum</HI> for each, would be &s;ufficient,
which will be a Trifle to &s;o wealthy a Body.
<PB N="20" REF="19">
The multiplicity of Holidays &s;hould be a|bridg'd,
and only a few kept; there
cannot be too few, con&s;idering what a
hinderance they are to juvenile Studies. It
is a vulgar Error that has too long prevail'd
all over <HI>England,</HI> to the great Detriment
of Learning, and many Boys have been
made Blockheads, in Complai&s;ance to
Kings and Saints, dead for many Ages
pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Morning employ'd in Mu&s;ick, the
Boys &s;hould go in the Afternoon, or &s;o
many Hours, to the Reading and Writ|ing-School,
and in the Evening &s;hould
practice, at lea&s;t two Hours before Bed|time,
and two before the Ma&s;ter comes in
the Morning. This Cour&s;e held for &s;even
or eight Years, will make them fine Pro|ficients;
but that they &s;hould not go too
raw, or young, out of the Academy, 'tis
proper, that at the &s;tated Age of Appren|tice&s;hip,
they be bound to the Ho&s;pital to
engage their greater Application, and make
them thorough Ma&s;ters, before they launch
out into the World; for one great hinde|rance
to many Performers is, that they be|gin
to teach too &s;oon, and ob&s;truct their
Genius.</P>
<P>What will not &s;uch a De&s;ign produce in
a few Years? will they not be able to perform
a Con&s;ort, Choir, or Opera, or all three a|mong
<PB N="21" REF="20">
them&s;elves, and over-pay the Charge,
as &s;hall hereafter be &s;pecify'd?</P>
<P>For Example, we will &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a
De&s;ign to be continued for ten Years, we
&s;hall find an Orche&s;tre of forty Hands, and
a Choir or Opera of twenty Voices, or
admitting that of tho&s;e twenty, only five
prove Capital Singers, 'twill an&s;wer the
Intent.</P>
<P>For the greater Variety they may, if
they think fit, take in two or more of their
Girls where they find a promi&s;ing Genius,
but this may be further con&s;ider'd of.</P>
<P>Now, when they are enabled to exhibit
an Opera, Will they not gain con&s;iderably,
when their Voices and Hands, co&s;t them
only a College Sub&s;i&s;tance? And 'tis but
rea&s;onable the Profits accruing from Ope|ras,
Con&s;orts, or otherwi&s;e, &s;hould go to
the <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> to make good all former and
future Expences, and enable them to extend
the De&s;ign to a greater Length and Gran|deur;
&s;o than in&s;tead of 1500 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI>
the price of one <HI>Italian</HI> Singer, we &s;hall
for 300 l. once in ten Years, have &s;ixty
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mu&s;icians regularly educated, and
enabled to live by their Science.</P>
<P>There ought moreover to be annual Proba|tions,
and proper Prizes or Premiums alloted,
to excite Emulation in the Youths, and give
Life to their Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
They have already a Mu&s;ick-School, as
they call it, but the Allowance is too poor
for this De&s;ign, and the Attendance too
&s;mall; it mu&s;t be every Day, or not at all.</P>
<P>This will be an Academy indeed, and in
Proce&s;s of Time, they will have even their
Ma&s;ters among them&s;elves; and what is the
Charge, compar'd with the Profits or
their Abilities?</P>
<P>One thing I had like to have forgot, which
is, that with Permi&s;&s;ion of the Right Re|verend
the Lords Spiritual, &s;ome Per|formance
in Mu&s;ick, &s;uitable to the So|lemnity
of the Day, be exhibited every
Sunday after Divine Service: Sacred Poe&s;y
and Rhetorick, may be likewi&s;e introduc'd to
make it an Entertainment &s;uitable to a Chri&s;t|ian
and Polite Audience; and indeed, we
&s;eem to want &s;ome &s;uch commendable Em|ployment
for the better Sort: For we &s;ee
the publick Walks and Taverns crowded,
and rather than be idle, they will go to
<HI>Newport- Market.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;uch an Entertainment would be
much preferable to Drinking, Gaming, or
profane Di&s;cour&s;e, none can deny, and till
it is proved to be prejudicial, I &s;hall always
imagine it nece&s;&s;ary. The Hall at the <HI>Ho&s;|pital,</HI>
will contain few le&s;s than &s;even
hundred People, conveniently &s;eated, which
at &s;o &s;mall a Price as one Shilling <HI>per</HI> Head,
will amount to 35 l. per Week; and if the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Performance de&s;erve it, as no doubt it
will in time, they may make it half a
Crown or more, which mu&s;t con&s;iderably
encrea&s;e the Income of the <HI>Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>When they are able to make an Opera,
the Profits will be yet more con&s;iderable,
nor will they reap much le&s;s from what
the Youths bring in during their Ap|prentice&s;hip,
when employ'd at Con&s;orts,
Theatres, or other publick Entertainments.</P>
<P>Having advanc'd what I think proper on
this Head, or at lea&s;t enough for a Hint,
I proceed to offer,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>That many Youths and Servants may be
&s;av'd from De&s;truction, were the Streets
clear'd of &s;hamele&s;s and impudent
Strumpets; Gaming-Tables totally &s;up|pre&s;s'd,
and a &s;top put to Sabbath De|bauches.</HEAD>
<P>THE Corruption of our Children
and Servants, is of Importance &s;uffici|ent
to require our utmo&s;t Precaution; and
moreover, Women Servants (common|ly
call'd Maid-Servants) are &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary
Creatures, that it is by no means below us
<PB N="24" REF="23">
to make them beneficial rather than preju|dicial
to us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not run into a De&s;cription
of their Abu&s;es; we know enough of
tho&s;e already. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s now is to
make them u&s;eful, Fir&s;t, by a&s;certaining
their Wages at a proper Standard.</P>
<P>Secondly, by obliging them to continue
longer in Service, not to &s;troll about
from Place to Place, and throw them&s;elves
on the Town on every Di&s;like.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To prevent their being har|bour'd
by wicked Per&s;ons, when out of
Place; or living too long on their own
Hands.</P>
<P>As for their Wages, they have topp'd upon
us already, and doubled 'em in &s;pight of our
Teeth; but as they have had Wit enough
to get 'em, &s;o will they, I doubt not,
have the &s;ame Sen&s;e to keep 'em: and
much Good may it do tho&s;e indolent over|&s;ecure
Per&s;ons, who have given 'em this
Advantage. However, if they are hone&s;t
and diligent, I would have them encou|rag'd,
and hand&s;ome Wages allow'd 'em;
becau&s;e, by this Means, we provide for
the Children of the inferior Cla&s;s of Peo|ple,
who otherwi&s;e could not maintain
them&s;elves; nay, &s;ometimes Trade&s;men,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> reduced, are glad when their Chil|dren
cea&s;e to hang upon them, by getting
into Service, and by that Means, not
<PB N="25" REF="24">
only maintaining them&s;elves, but being
of U&s;e in other Families. But then there
ought to be &s;ome Medium &s;ome Limita|tion
to their Wages, or they may extort
more than can well be afforded.</P>
<P>Nothing calls more for Redre&s;s than
their quitting Service for every idle Di&s;|gu&s;t,
leaving a Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s at a
Nonplus; and all under Plea of a fooli&s;h
old Cu&s;tom, call'd Warning; no where
practis'd but in <HI>London:</HI> For in other
Places they are hir'd by the Year, or by
the Statute, as they call it, which &s;ettles
them in a Place, at lea&s;t for &s;ome Time;
whereas, when they are not limited, it
encourages a roving Temper, and makes
them never ea&s;y.</P>
<P>If you turn them away without Warn|ing,
they will make you pay a Month's
Wages, be the Provocation or Offence
never &s;o great; but if they leave you,
tho' never &s;o abruptly, or unprovided,
help your&s;elves how you can, there is no
Redre&s;s: Tho' I think there ought, in all
Con&s;cience, to be as much Law for the
Ma&s;ter as for the Servant.</P>
<P>No Servant &s;hould quit a Place, where
they are well fed and paid, without a&s;|&s;igning
a good Rea&s;on before a Magi|&s;trate.
On the other Hand, they &s;hould
receive no Abu&s;e which &s;hould not be re|dre&s;s'd:
For we ought to treat 'em as
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Servants, not Slaves; and a Medium
ought to be ob&s;erv'd on both Sides. But
if they are not re&s;train'd from quitting
Service on every Vagary, they will throw
them&s;elves on the Town, and not only
ruin them&s;elves, but others: For Exam|ple,
a Girl quits a Place, and turns Whore;
if there is not a Ba&s;tard to be murder'd,
or left to the Pari&s;h, there is One or more
unwary Youths drawn in to &s;upport her
in Lewdne&s;s and Idlene&s;s; in order to
which, they rob their Parents and Ma|&s;ters,
nay, &s;ometimes any Body el&s;e, to
&s;upport their Strumpets; &s;o that many
Thieves owe their Ruin and &s;hameful
Deaths to Harlots. Not to mention the
Communication of loath&s;ome Di&s;tempers,
and innumerable other Evils, to which
they give Birth.</P>
<P>How many Youths, of all Ranks, are dai|ly
ruin'd? And how ju&s;tly may be dreaded
the Lo&s;s of as many more, if a &s;peedy Stop
be not put to this growing Evil? Generati|ons
to come will cur&s;e the Neglect of the
pre&s;ent, and every Sin committed for the
future may be pa&s;s'd to our Account, if we
do not u&s;e our Endeavours to the contrary.</P>
<P>And unle&s;s we prevent our Maid-Ser|vants
from being harbour'd by wicked
Per&s;ons when out of Place, or living too
long on their own Hands, our Streets will
&s;warm with impudent &s;hamele&s;s Strum|pets;
<PB N="27" REF="26">
the Good will be mole&s;ted; tho&s;e,
prone to Evil, will be made yet more
wicked, by having Temptations thrown
in their Way: And to crown all, we &s;hall
have &s;carce a Servant left, but our Wives,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t do the Hou&s;hold-work them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>If
this be not worthy the Con&s;ideration
of a Legi&s;lature, I would fain know
what is. Is it not Time to limit their
Wages, when they are grown &s;o wanton
they know not what to ask? Is it not
Time to fix 'em, when they &s;troll from
Place to Place, and we are hardly &s;ure of
a Servant a Month together? Is it not
Time to prevent the Encrea&s;e of Harlots,
by making it penal for Servants to be
harbour'd in Idlene&s;s, and tempted to
Theft, Whoredom, Murder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by living
too long out of Place? And I am &s;ure
it is high Time to begin the Work, by
clearing the publick Streets of Night|walkers,
who are grown to &s;uch a Pitch
of Impudence, that Peace and common
Decency are manife&s;tly broken in our pub|lick
Streets. I wonder this has &s;o long
e&s;cap'd the Eye of the Magi&s;trate, e&s;pe|cially
when there are already in force
Laws &s;ufficient to re&s;train this Tide of
Uncleanne&s;s, which will one Day over|flow
us.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
The lewde&s;t People upon Earth, our|&s;elves
excepted, are not guilty of &s;uch
open Violations of the Laws of Decency.
Go all the World over, and you'll &s;ee no
&s;uch Impudence as in the Streets of <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
which makes many Foreigners give
our Women in general a bad Character,
from the vile Specimens they meet with
from one End of the Town to the other.
Our Se&s;&s;ions-Papers are full of the Triais
of impudent Sluts, who fir&s;t decoy Men,
and then rob 'em: A Meanne&s;s the Cour|te&s;ans
of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> abhor.</P>
<P>How many hone&s;t Women, tho&s;e of
the Inferior Sort e&s;pecially, get loath&s;ome
Di&s;tempers from their Husband's Com|merce
with the&s;e Creatures, which Di|&s;tempers
are often entail'd on Po&s;terity;
nor have we an Ho&s;pital &s;eparated for that
Purpo&s;e, which does not contain too ma|ny
In&s;tances of hone&s;t poor Wretches
made mi&s;erable by Villains of Husbands.</P>
<P>And now I have mentioned the Vil|lainy
of &s;ome Husbands in the lower
State of Life, give me leave to propo&s;e,
or at lea&s;t to wi&s;h, that they were re|&s;trained
from abu&s;ing their Wives at that
barbarous Rate, which is now practi&s;ed
by Butchers, Carmen, and &s;uch inferior
Sort of Fellows, who are publick Nu|&s;ances
to civil Neighbourhoods, and yet no
Body cares to interpo&s;e, becau&s;e the Riot
is between a Man and his Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why every profligate
Fellow &s;hall have the Liberty to di&s;turb a
whole Neighbourhood, and abu&s;e a poor
hone&s;t Creature at a mo&s;t inhuman Rate,
and is not to be call'd to Account becau&s;e
it is his Wife; this &s;ort of Barbarity was
never &s;o notorious and &s;o much encourag'd
as at pre&s;ent, for every Vagabond thinks
he may cripple his Wife at plea&s;ure, and
'tis enough to pierce a Heart of Stone to
&s;ee how barbarou&s;ly &s;ome poor Creatures
are beaten and abu&s;ed by mercile&s;s Dogs
of Husbands.</P>
<P>It gives an ill Example to the growing
Generation, and this Evil will gain Ground
on us if not prevented: It may be an|&s;wer'd,
the Law has already provided Re|dre&s;s,
and a Woman abus'd may &s;wear
the Peace again&s;t her Husband, but what
Woman cares to do that? It is reveng|ing
her&s;elf on her&s;elf, and not without
con&s;iderable Charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>There ought to be a &s;horter way, and
when a Man has beaten his Wife (which
by the Bye is a mo&s;t unmanly Action, and
great Sign of Cowardice) it behoves every
Neighbour who has the lea&s;t humanity or
Compa&s;&s;ion, to complain to the next Ju|&s;tice
of the Peace, who &s;hould be im|powered
to &s;et him in the Stocks for the
fir&s;t Offence; to have him well &s;courg'd at
the Whipping-Po&s;t for the &s;econd; and
<PB N="30" REF="29">
if he per&s;i&s;ted in his barbarous Abu&s;e of the
holy Marriage State, to &s;end him to the
Hou&s;e of Correction 'till he &s;hould learn

<P>How hard is it for a poor indu&s;trious
Woman to be up early and late, to &s;it in a
cold Shop, Stall, or Market, all Weathers,
to carry heavy Loads from one End of the
Town to the other, or to work from
Morning till Night, and even then dread
going Home for fear of being murder'd?
Some may think this too low a Topic for
me to expatiate upon, to which I an&s;wer,
that it is a Charitable and a Chri&s;tian one,
and therefore not in the lea&s;t beneath the
Con&s;ideration of any Man who had a Wo|man
for his Mother.</P>
<P>The Mention of this leads me to exclaim
again&s;t the vile Practice now &s;o much in
vogue among the better Sort, as they are
called, but the wor&s;t &s;ort in fact, namely,
the &s;ending their Wives to Mad-Hou&s;es at
every Whim or Di&s;like, that they may be
more &s;ecure and undi&s;turb'd in their De|baucheries:
Which wicked Cu&s;tom is got to
&s;uch a Head, that the Number of private
Mad-Hou&s;es in and about <HI>London,</HI> are

<P>This is the heighth of Barbarity and In|ju&s;tice

<P>How many, I &s;ay, of Beauty, Vertue,

<P>Nay it is Murder upon Murder, for the

Now if this kind of Murder is conniv'd

to a be Law-giver. In my humble
Opinion all private Mad-Hou&s;es &s;hould be
&s;uppre&s;s'd at once, and it &s;hould be no le&s;s
than Felony to confine any Per&s;on under
pretence of Madne&s;s without due Au|thority.</P>
<P>For
the cure of tho&s;e who are really
Lunatick, licens'd Mad-Hou&s;es &s;hould be
con&s;tituted in convenient Parts of the
Town, which Hou&s;es &s;hould be &s;ubject to
proper Vi&s;itation and In&s;pection, nor
&s;hould any Per&s;on be &s;ent to a Mad-Hou&s;e
without due Rea&s;on, Inquiry and
Authority.</P>
<P>It may be objected, by Per&s;ons deter|mined
to contradict every thing and approve
nothing, that the Abu&s;es complained of
are not &s;o numerous or heinous as I would
in&s;inuate: Why are not Facts advanced,
they will be apt &s;ay, to give a Face of
Truth to the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions? but I have two
Rea&s;ons to the contrary; the fir&s;t is, the
more you convince them the more angry
you make 'em, for they are never better
plea&s;ed than when they have an Opportu|nity
of finding Fault: Therefore to curry
Favour with the Fault-finders, I have left
'em a loop Hole: the &s;econd and real is, be|cau&s;e
I don't care to bring an old Hou&s;e over
my Head by mentioning particular Names

at Law, from litigious Wretches, who
would be galled to find their Villainies
made publick; and &s;tick at no Expence

of an unhappy Widow, put in by a
Villain of a Husband, and now continued

Apparel, nay ill us'd into the Bargain;

one particular Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A Lady of known Beauty, Vertue, and
Fortune, nay more, of Wi&s;dom, not fla&s;hy
Wit, was, in the Prime of her Youth and
Beauty, and when her Sen&s;es were perfect|ly
&s;ound, carried by her Husband in his
Coach as to the Opera; but the Coachman
had other In&s;tructions, and drove directly
to a Mad-Hou&s;e, where the poor innocent
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Lady was no &s;ooner introduced, under pre|tence
of calling by the way to &s;ee &s;ome
Pictures he had a mind to buy, but the
Key was turn'd upon her, and &s;he left a
Pri&s;oner by her faithle&s;s Husband; who
while his injur'd Wife was confined and
us'd with the utmo&s;t Barbarity, He like a
profligate Wretch ran through her For|tune
with Strumpets, and then, ba&s;ely,
under Pretence of giving her Liberty,
extorted her to make over her Jointure:
which &s;he had no &s;ooner done but he
laugh'd in her Face, and left her to be
as ill us'd as ever. This he &s;oon ran
through, and (happily for the Lady) died
by the Ju&s;tice of Heaven in a Salivation his
Debauches had oblig'd him to undergo.</P>
<P>During her Confinement, the Villain of
the Mad-Hou&s;e frequently attempted her
Cha&s;tity; and the more &s;he repuls'd him,
the wor&s;e he treated her: till at la&s;t he
drove her mad in good earne&s;t. Her
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Brother, who is fond of her to
the la&s;t Degree, now confines her in part
of his own Hou&s;e, treating her with great
Tenderne&s;s; but has the Mortification to
be a&s;&s;ured by the able&s;t Phy&s;icians, that his
poor Si&s;ter is irrecoverably di&s;tracted.</P>

and there are Sharpers of different Stati|ons

<P>But the mo&s;t barbarous Part of this
helli&s;h Trade, is what they call &s;etting
of young Gentlemen, Apprentices, and
<PB N="40" REF="39">
others; this ought to be deem'd Felony,
without Benefit of Clergy; for 'tis the
wor&s;t of Thievery. Under Pretence of
taking a Bottle, or &s;pending an Evening
gayly, they draw their Cull to the Ta|vern,
where they &s;it not long before the
Devil's Bones or Books are found acciden|tally
on purpo&s;e, by the Help of which
they &s;trip my Gentleman in an In&s;tant,
and then generou&s;ly lend him his own
Money, to lo&s;e a fre&s;h, and create a Debt,
which is but too often more ju&s;tly paid
than tho&s;e more ju&s;tly due.</P>
<P>If we look into &s;ome late Bankrupcies,
we &s;hall find &s;ome noted Game&s;ters the

Ca&s;es, 'twould be but Ju&s;tice to make

E&s;tate to make good the Deficiencies
of the Bankrupt's Effects. If Traders
have no more Wit, the Publick &s;hould
have Pity on 'em; and make it as penal

Cards, Dice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were totally &s;uppre&s;s'd,
Indu&s;try and Arts would encrea&s;e the

in every Thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ee it &s;o prevalent in the

<P>It is the Bane of all Conver&s;ation: And
tho&s;e who can't &s;it an Hour without
Gaming, &s;hould never go into a Club to
&s;poil Company. In a Word, 'tis mere
Madne&s;s, and a mo&s;t &s;tupid Thing to
hazard ones Fortune, and perplex ones
Mind; nay, to &s;it up whole Nights,
poring over Toys of pipt Ivory and paint|ed
Pa&s;teboard, making our &s;elves wor&s;e

<P>To &s;um up all, I think 'twould be a
noble Retribution, to &s;ubject Game&s;ter's
E&s;tates to the U&s;e and Support of the poor
Widows and Orphans of their unfortunate
Bubbles.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> Debauches are Abu&s;es that call
loud for Amendment: 'Tis in this perni|cious
Soil the Seeds of Ruin are fir&s;t

<P>Not that I am &s;o &s;uperciliou&s;ly &s;trict,

<P>Some heedle&s;s Youths are wheedled into

and for fear of a Di&s;covery, make away

Fears: Not to mention the Fru&s;tra|tion
of their Fortune, and the Mi&s;eries
that attend a Vagabond Life. Thus ho|ne&s;t
Parents lo&s;e their Children, and

out &s;o late to give no &s;mall Di&s;turbance in
&s;ober Families. It therefore behoves every
Ma&s;ter of a Family to have his Servants
under his Eye: And if the going to Church,
Meeting, or whatever Place of Wor&s;hip
&s;uited their Religion, were more enforc'd,
it would be &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Luxury of the Age will
be the Ruin of the Nation, if not pre|vented.
We leave Trade to game in
Stocks: We live above our&s;elves, and
barter our Ready-money for Trifles; Tea
and Wine are all we &s;eem anxious for, and
God has given the Ble&s;&s;ings of Life to an
ungrateful People, who de&s;pi&s;e their own
Productions. Our very Plough-Fellows
drink Wine now a-days: Our Farmers,
Gra&s;iers, and Butchers, are above Malt-Liquors;
and the whole&s;ome Breakfa&s;t of
Water-gruel and Milk-pottage is chang'd
for Coffee and Tea. This is the Rea&s;on
<PB N="44" REF="43">
Provi&s;ions and Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o dear; we

Hou&s;es are kept open to furni&s;h our

Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, out of a Scruple of
Con&s;cience. For Example; in extreme
hot Weather, when Meat will not keep
from <HI>Saturday</HI> to <HI>Sunday,</HI> we throw, or
cau&s;e to be thrown away, va&s;t Quantities
of tainted Meat, and have generally &s;tink|ing
Dinners, becau&s;e the Butchers dare
not &s;ell a Joint of Meat on a <HI>Sunday</HI>

Market-Day, yet, rather than abu&s;e God's
Mercies by throwing away Creatures
given for our U&s;e, nay, for our own
Healths and Cleanline&s;s Sake, I would
have the &s;ame Indulgence in extreme hot
Weather, as there is for Milk and Mack|rell;
that is to &s;ay, that Meat might be

One or Two of the Clock, and &s;old 'till

I cannot forbear taking Notice of the

are mo&s;t u&s;eful when Indu&s;trious, and as
pernicious when lazy. By their Indu&s;try
our Manufactures, Trade, and Commerce
are carried on: The Merchant in his
Compting Hou&s;e, and the Captain in his
Cabbin would find but little Employment
were it not that many Hands carried on
the different Branches of the Concern

<P>But now &s;o far are our common People
infatuated with <HI>Geneva,</HI> that Half the
Work is not done now as formerly. It
debilitates and enervates them, and they
are not near &s;o &s;trong and healthy as for|merly.
This accur&s;ed Liquor is in it&s;elf
&s;o diuretick, it over-&s;trains the Parts of
Generation, and makes our common
People incapable of getting &s;uch lu&s;ty
Children as they us'd to do. Add to this,
that the Women, by drinking it, &s;poil
their Milk, and by giving it to young
Children, as they fooli&s;hly do, &s;poil
the Stomach, and hinder Dige&s;tion; &s;o

There is not in Nature &s;o unhealthy a

<P>On the contrary, our own Malt Liquors,
e&s;pecially common Draught Beer, is mo&s;t
whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing, and has

bal&s;amick: It helps Dige&s;tion, and car|ries
Nouri&s;hment with it. And, in &s;pight
of the Whims of &s;ome Phy&s;icians, is mo&s;t
pertinent to a humane, e&s;pecially a good
whole&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. Nay,

<HEAD>An effectual Method to prevent Street-Robberies.</HEAD>
<P>THE
principal Encouragements, and
Opportunity given to Street-Robbers
is, that our Streets are &s;o poorly watch'd;
the Watchmen, for the mo&s;t Part, being
decrepid, &s;uperannuated Wretches, with
one Foot in the Grave, and the t'other
ready to follow; &s;o feeble, that a Puff
of Breath can blow 'em down: Poor crazy
Mortals! Much fitter for an Alms-hou&s;e
than a Watch-hou&s;e. A City watch'd and
guarded by &s;uch Animals, is wretchedly
watch'd indeed.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o little Terror do our Watchmen
carry with them, that hardy Thieves make
a mere Je&s;t of 'em, and &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">
even the very Watchmen, who &s;hould ap|prehend
'em, to light 'em in their Roguery:
And what can a poor Creature do, in Ter|ror
of his Life, &s;urrounded by a Pack of
Ruffians, and no A&s;&s;i&s;tance near.</P>
<P>Add to this, that our Rogues are grown
more wicked than ever, and Vice in all
Kinds is &s;o much wink'd at, that Robbery
<PB N="48" REF="47">
is accounted a petty Crime. We take pains
to puff 'em up in their Villainy, and Thieves
are &s;et out in &s;o amiable a Light in the
<HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> that it has taught them to
value them&s;elves on their Profe&s;&s;ion, rather
than be a&s;ham'd of it.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome Ce&s;&s;ation of Street-Robberies,
from the Time of <HI>Bunworth</HI>
and <HI>Blewitt</HI>'s Execution, 'till the Intro|duction
of this pious Opera. Now we find
the <HI>Cartouchian</HI> Villainies revived, and
<HI>London,</HI> that us'd to be the mo&s;t &s;afe and
peaceful City in the Univer&s;e, is now a
Scene of Rapine and Danger. If &s;ome of
<HI>Cartouch</HI>'s Gang be not come over to in|&s;truct
our Thieves, and propagate their
Schemes, we have, doubtle&s;s, a <HI>Cartouch</HI>

be very &s;hocking to &s;ober Parents.</P>
<P>Our Youth, in general, have too much
Liberty; the Sabbath is not kept with
due Solemnity; Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of
Families are too remi&s;s in the Care of the
Souls committed to their Charge. Family
Prayer is neglected; and, to the Shame of
Scoffers be it &s;poken, too much ridiculed.
All Ages and Sexes, if in Health, &s;hould
be obliged to attend publick Wor&s;hip, ac|cording
to their re&s;pective Opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">
Were it only to keep Youth out of Harm's
Way, it would do well. But it is to be
hoped, if their Parents, Ma&s;ters, or Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
&s;hould oblige their Attendance at
publick Devotion, they would edify by
what they &s;hould hear, and many wicked
Acts would be &s;tifled in their Infancy,
and check'd even in the Intention, by
good and u&s;eful Doctrine.</P>
<P>Our common People make it a Day of
Debauch, and get &s;o drunk on a Sunday,
they cannot work for a Day or two fol|lowing.
Nay, &s;ince the U&s;e of Geneva
has become &s;o common, many get &s;o often
drunk they cannot work at all, but run
from one Irregularity to another, 'till at
la&s;t they become arrant Rogues. And
this is the Foundation of all our pre&s;ent
Complaints.</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e a Man able to maintain
him&s;elf and Family by his Trade, and at
the &s;ame Time to be a Geneva-drinker:
This Fellow fir&s;t makes him&s;elf inca|pable
of working, by being continually
drunk; this runs him behind-hand, and
he either pawns or neglects his Work, for
which Rea&s;on no Body will employ him.
At la&s;t, Fear of Arre&s;ts, his own Hunger,
the Cries of his Family for Bread, his na|tural
De&s;ire to &s;upport an irregular Life,
and a propen&s;e Hatred to Labour, turn
but too many an hone&s;t Trade&s;man into
<PB N="51" REF="50">
an arrant de&s;perate Rogue: And the&s;e are
commonly the Means that furni&s;h us with
Thieves and Villains in general.</P>
<P>Thus is a Man, that might be u&s;eful
in a Body politick, render'd obnoxious to
the &s;ame: And if this Trade of Wicked|ne&s;s
goes on, they will grow and encrea&s;e
upon us, in&s;omuch, that we &s;hall not
dare to &s;tir out of our Habitations; nay, it
will be well if they arrive not to the Im|pudence
of plundering our Hou&s;es at
Noon day.</P>
<P>Where is the Courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation, that a Gentleman, with Six or
Seven Servants, &s;hall be robb'd by one
&s;ingle Highwayman? Yet we have lately
had In&s;tances of this; and for this we may
thank our Effeminacy, our Toupee Wigs,
and powder'd Pates, our Tea, and other
&s;candalous Fopperies; and above all, the
Di&s;u&s;e of noble and manly Sports, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to a brave People, once in Vogue,
but now totally lo&s;t among us.</P>
<P>Let not the Reader think I run from
my Subject, if I &s;earch the Bottom of the
Di&s;temper before I propo&s;e a Cure, which
having done, tho' indeed but &s;lightly, for
this is an Argument could be carried to
a much greater Length, I proceed next to
propo&s;e Earthly Means in the Manner fol|lowing.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="51">
Let the Watch be compo&s;ed of &s;tout
able bodied Men, and of tho&s;e at lea&s;t
treble the Number now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, that
is to &s;ay, a Watchman to every Forty
Hou&s;es, Twenty on one Side of the Way,
and Twenty on the other; for it is ob|&s;ervable,
that a Man cannot well &s;ee di|&s;tinctly
beyond the Extent of Twenty
Hou&s;es in a Row; if 'tis a &s;ingle Row,
and no oppo&s;ite Hou&s;es, the Charge mu&s;t
be greater, and their Safety le&s;s. This
Man &s;hould be elected, and paid by the
Hou&s;ekeepers them&s;elves, to prevent Mi&s;|application
and Abu&s;e, &s;o much complain'd
of, in the Di&s;tribution of Publick Money.</P>
<P>He &s;hould be allow'd 10<HI>s. per Annum,</HI>
by each Hou&s;ekeeper, which at Forty
Hou&s;es, as above &s;pecify'd, amounts to
20<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> almo&s;t treble to what is
at pre&s;ent allow'd; and yet mo&s;t Hou&s;e|keepers
are charg'd at lea&s;t 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> a
Quarter to the Watch, who&s;e beat is, ge|nerally
&s;peaking, little le&s;s than the Com|pa&s;s
of half a Mile.</P>
<P>This Salary is &s;omething of Encourage|ment,
and a pretty Settlement to a poor
Man, who, with Frugality, may live de|cently
thereon, and, by due Re&s;t, be
enabled to give vigilant Attendance.</P>
<P>If a Hou&s;ekeeper break, or a Hou&s;e is
empty, the poor Watchman ought not to
<PB N="53" REF="52">
&s;uffer, the Deficiency &s;hould be made up
by the Hou&s;ekeepers remaining.</P>
<P>Or, indeed, all Hou&s;ekeepers might be
excus'd, if a Tax of only 1<HI>s. per Annum</HI>
were levied on every Batchelor within the
Bills of Mortality, and above the Age of
One and Twenty, who is not a Hou&s;e|keeper;
for the&s;e young Sparks are a
Kind of unprofitable Gentry to the State;
they claim publick Safety and Advantages,
and yet pay nothing to the Publick, nay
indeed, they, in a Manner, live upon the
Publick, for (on a <HI>Sunday</HI> e&s;pecially) at
lea&s;t a Million of the&s;e Gentlemen quar|ter
them&s;elves upon the married Men,
and rob many Families of part of a Week's
Provi&s;ion, more particularly when they
play a good Knife and Fork, and are of
the Family of the <HI>Tuckers.</HI></P>
<P>I beg Pardon for this whim&s;ical Propo|&s;al,
which, ludicrous as it &s;eems, has
&s;omething in it; and may be improved.
Return we, in the mean Time, to our
Subject.</P>
<P>The Watch thus &s;tation'd, &s;trengthen'd,
and encourag'd, let every Watchman be
arm'd with Fire-Arms and Sword; and
let no Watchman &s;tand above Twenty
Doors di&s;tant from his Fellow.</P>
<P>Let each Watchman be provided with
a Bugle-Horn, to &s;ound on Alarm, or in
Time of Danger; and let it be made pe|nal,
<PB N="54" REF="53">
if not Felony, for any but a Watch|man
to &s;ound a Horn in and about the
City, from the Time of their going on,
to that of their going off.</P>
<P>An Objection will be here made on
Account of the Po&s;t-Boys, to obviate
which, I had Thoughts of a Bell, but
that would be too ponderous and trouble|&s;ome
for a Watchman to carry, be&s;ides
his Arms and Lanthorn. As to a fix'd
Bell, if the Watchman is at another Part
of his Walk, how can he give Notice?
Be&s;ides, Rogues may play Tricks
with the Bell; whereas a Horn is portable,
always ready, and mo&s;t alarming.</P>
<P>Let the Po&s;t-Boys, therefore, u&s;e &s;ome
other Signal, &s;ince this is mo&s;t convenient
to this more material Purpo&s;e. They
may carry a Bell in a Hol&s;ter, with Ea&s;e,
and give Notice by that, as well as tho&s;e
who collect the Letters.</P>
<P>That the Watchmen may &s;ee from one
End of their Walks to the other, let a
convenient Number of Lamps be &s;et up,
and tho&s;e not of the Convex Kind, which
blind the Eyes, and are of no manner of
U&s;e; they dazzle, but give no di&s;tinct
Light: And farther, rather than prevent
Robberies. Many, deceiv'd and blinded
by the&s;e <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> have been run over
by Coaches, Carts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> People &s;tumble
more upon one another, even under the&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="54">
very Lamps, than in the Dark. In &s;hort,
they are mo&s;t unprofitable Lights, and,
in my Opinion, rather Abu&s;es than Bene|fits.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides,
I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why every Ten
Hou&s;ekeepers can't find a Lamp among
them&s;elves, and let their Watchman dre&s;s
it, rather than fatten a crew of Directors:
But we are &s;o fond of Companies, 'tis a
Wonder we have not our Shooes black'd
by one, and a Set of Directors made rich
at the Expence of our very Black-guards.
Convenient Turn-pikes and Stoppages
may be made to prevent E&s;capes, and it
will be proper for a Watchman to be
plac'd at one of the&s;e, fix'd at the End of
a Lane, Court, Alley, or other Thorough|fare,
which may happen in any Part of
his Beat, and &s;o as not to ob&s;truct his
View to both Ends thereof, or being able
to give Notice, as afore&s;aid; for the
Watch ought to be in View, as well as in
the Hearing of each other, or they may
be overpower'd, and much Danger may
happen.</P>
<P>The Streets thus guarded and illumi|nated,
what remains, but that the Money
allotted by the Government be in&s;tantly
paid on Conviction of every Offender;
for Delays in this Ca&s;e are of dangerous
Con&s;equence, and no Body will venture
their Lives in Hopes of a Reward, if it
<PB N="56" REF="55">
be not duly and timely paid. If there is
Rea&s;on of Complaint on this Head, it
ought to be look'd into by tho&s;e at the
Helm; for nothing can be more vile than
for Underlings to abu&s;e the Benevolence
of the Publick, or their Superiors, by &s;ink|ing,
abridging, or delaying publick or
private Benefits. And it is by no Means
below the Dignity, or Care, even of the
greate&s;t, to &s;ee the Di&s;po&s;al of their own
Bounty and Charity; for it lo&s;es but too
often by the Carriage: And where a
Nobleman, or other generous Per&s;on, has
order'd Five Guineas to be given, 'tis well
if the proper Object has had even One.</P>
<P>Something allow'd by the Chamber of
<HI>London,</HI> to every Per&s;on apprehending a
Robber, would have a good Effect, e&s;pe|cially
if it be not told over a Gridiron,
but paid without Delay, or Abatement.
And what if the fewer Cu&s;tards are eat, &s;o
it augment the Publick Safety.</P>
<P>Some of our common Soldiery are (and
I hope unju&s;tly) &s;u&s;pected. This may be
ea&s;ily confuted, if &s;trict Orders are en|forc'd,
that none but Commi&s;&s;ion, or
Warrant Officers &s;hall be out of their
Quarters after Ten at Night. But if we
con&s;ider, that neither <HI>Blewit, Bunworth,</HI>
or their Gangs, were Soldiers, and that of
tho&s;e who have been executed for Ten
Years pa&s;t, not One in Ten were Soldiers,
<PB N="57" REF="56">
but, on the contrary, Seamen di&s;charg'd,
and thrown on the Publick, without pre|&s;ent
Sub&s;i&s;tence, which made them de&s;|perate:
But I hope the Act now depend|ing
for the Encouragement of Seamen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
will &s;ufficiently remove that Ob&s;tacle al&s;o.
This, I hope, will &s;top the Mouths of
cen&s;orious Per&s;ons, who unju&s;tly arraign
our Soldiery for the Vices of others:
However, to make all ea&s;y, I believe the
Generality of them will gladly &s;ubmit to
the Re&s;traint propos'd, merely to &s;how
their Innocence.</P>
<P>Mean Time, would his mo&s;t &s;acred
Maje&s;ty let them partake of his Bounty,
as the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have done, and rai&s;e
their Pay, were it but One Penny <HI>per
Diem,</HI> it would be a mo&s;t Royal Bounty,
would con&s;iderably contribute to their
Support, and put them above any &s;ordid
Views: And there was never more Occa|&s;ion
than now, when Provi&s;ions of all
Kinds are &s;o exce&s;&s;ive dear.</P>
<P>Having offer'd my little Mite to the
Publick, I beg they will excu&s;e the Defi|ciency
of my Stile, and Multitude of my
Errors, for my Intention's Sake. I write
without Pro&s;pect of Gain: If I am cen|&s;ured,
'tis what I can but expect; but if,
among all my Schemes, One proves of
Service, my De&s;ires and Labours are
amply an&s;wer'd.</P>

<P>IN my Scheme for an Univer&s;ity in
<HI>London,</HI> I propo&s;ed only a Hall or
publick Room; on Recollection I find it
&s;hould be a large Hou&s;e or Inn, in the Na|ture
of a College, with &s;tore of conve|nient
Rooms for Gentlemen, not only to
&s;tudy &s;eparately, but wherein to lodge
their Books, for 'twould be mo&s;t inconve|nient
to lug them backwards and forwards:
They may indeed Breakfa&s;t, Sup, and Sleep
at Home, but 'twill be highly nece&s;&s;ary
they &s;hould dine in Commons, or at lea&s;t
near the College; not that I would have
Cooks, Butlers, Caterers, Manciples, and
the whole Train of College Cannibals re|tained;
but for fear they &s;hould &s;tay too
long at Home, or be hindred from return|ing
to Study in due time, &s;ome proper
Place or Per&s;on might be pitch'd upon to
keep an Ordinary at a prefix'd Price and
Hour, and for the Students only.</P>
<P>My Rea&s;ons are the&s;e:<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, A young Gentleman may live too
far from College.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Second, The College Hours for Dinner,
may not agree with tho&s;e of the Family.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="59" REF="58">Third, Company may drop in and de|tain
him.</ITEM>
</LIST> The&s;e being, I think, the only mate|rial
Objections could be offered, I hope I
have amply provided again&s;t them, and
rendered my Project more perfect and un|exceptionable.</P>
<P>One
Omi&s;&s;ion I made in the Di&s;cour&s;e on
Mad-Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is, that Maiden Ladies
as well as Widows and Wives, are liable
to the Inqui&s;ition there complained of,
and I am inform'd a good E&s;tate is lately
come to a worthle&s;s Family, by the Death,
or rather Murder of an innocent young
Creature, who being left very rich, cho&s;e
to live with her Friends; but well had it
been for her, had &s;he taken up her Abode
among Strangers, for they &s;tay'd off all
Propo&s;als for Marriage a con&s;iderable time,
and when at la&s;t they found the Lady
would not be hindered from altering her
Condition, &s;he was hurried away to a
Mad-Hou&s;e, where &s;he mi&s;erably ended
her Days, while they rioted in the Pillage
of her Fortune. Thus neither Maid,
Wife or Widdow, are &s;afe, while the&s;e
accur&s;ed Mad-Hou&s;es are &s;uffered: Nay, I
&s;ee no Rea&s;on, (if the Age improves in
Wickedne&s;s, as in all Probability it may)
but the Men, <HI>per Contra,</HI> may take their
Turns. Younger Brothers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may clap
<PB N="60" REF="59">
up their Elders and jump into their E&s;tates,
for there are no Que&s;tions ask'd at the&s;e
Mad-Hou&s;es, but who is the Pay-ma&s;ter,
and how much; give them but their
Price, mad or not mad 'tis no matter
whom they confine; &s;o that if any Per&s;on
lives longer than his Relations think con|venient,
they know their Remedy, 'tis
but &s;ending them to a Mad-Hou&s;e and
the E&s;tate's their own.</P>
<P>Having an&s;wer'd all that I think liable
to Objection, and recollected what I had
omitted, I de&s;ire to &s;tand or fall by the
Judgment of the &s;erious Part of Mankind;
wherein they &s;hall correct me I will ki&s;s
the Rod and &s;uffer with Patience; but if
a pack of Hackney Scriblers &s;hall attack
me only by way of a get-Penny, I &s;hall
not be provoked to an&s;wer them be they
never &s;o &s;currilous, le&s;t I be accounted as
