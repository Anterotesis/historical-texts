<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age advanced to the highe&s;t degree of refinement, that &s;pecies of curio&s;ity commences, which is bu&s;ied in contemplating the progre&s;s of &s;ocial life, in di&s;playing the gradations of &s;cience, and in tracing the tran&s;itions from barbari&s;m to civility.</P>
<P>That the&s;e &s;peculations &s;hould become the fa|vourite pur&s;uits, and the fa&s;hionable topics, of &s;uch a period, is extremely natural. We look back on the &s;avage condition of our ance&s;tors with the triumph of &s;uperiority; we are plea&s;ed to mark the &s;teps by which we have been rai&s;ed from rudene&s;s to elegance: and our reflections on this &s;ubject are accom|panied with a con&s;cious pride, ari&s;ing in great mea&s;ure from a tacit compari&s;on of the infinite di&s;proportion between the feeble efforts of remote ages, and our pre&s;ent improvements in knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">
In the mean time, the manners, monuments, cu&s;toms, practices, and opinions of antiquity, by forming &s;o &s;trong a contra&s;t with tho&s;e of our own times, and by exhibiting human nature and human inventions in new lights, in in unexpected appearances, and in various forms, are objects which forcibly &s;trike a feeling imagination.</P>
<P>Nor does this &s;pectacle afford nothing more than a fruitle&s;s gratification to the fancy. It teaches us to &s;et a ju&s;t e&s;timation on our own acqui&s;itions; and encourages us to cheri&s;h that cultivation, which is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the exi&s;tence and the exerci&s;e of every &s;ocial virtue.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles, to develop the dawnings of genius, and to pur&s;ue the progre&s;s of our national poetry, from a rude origin and ob&s;cure beginnings, to its perfection in a poli&s;hed age, mu&s;t prove an intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive inve&s;tigation. But a hi&s;|tory of poetry, for another rea&s;on, yet on the &s;ame principles, mu&s;t be more e&s;pecially productive of en|tertainment and utility. I mean, as it is an art, who&s;e object is human &s;ociety: as it has the peculiar merit, in its operations on that object, of faithfully re|cording the features of the times, and of pre&s;erving
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
the mo&s;t picture&s;que and expre&s;&s;ive repre|&s;entations of manners: and, becau&s;e the fir&s;t mo|numents of compo&s;ition in every nation are tho&s;e of the poet, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the additional advantage of tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity genuine delineations of life in its &s;imple&s;t &s;tages. Let me add, that anec|dotes of the rudiments of a favourite art will always be particularly plea&s;ing. The more early &s;peci|mens of poetry mu&s;t ever amu&s;e, in proportion to the plea&s;ure which we receive from its fini&s;hed productions.</P>
<P>Much however depends on the execution of &s;uch a de&s;ign, and my readers are to decide in what degree I have done ju&s;tice to &s;o &s;pecious and promi&s;ing a di&s;qui&s;ition. Yet a few more words will not be perhaps improper, in vindication, or rather in explanation, of the manner in which my work has been conducted. I am &s;ure I do not mean, nor can I pretend, to apologi&s;e for its defects.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;e to exhibit the hi&s;tory of our poetry in a chronological &s;eries: not di&s;tributing my mat|ter into detached articles, of periodical divi&s;ions, or of general heads. Yet I have not always adhered &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly to the regularity of annals, but that I
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
have often deviated into incidental digre&s;&s;ions; and have &s;ometimes &s;topped in the cour&s;e of my career, for the &s;ake of recapitulation, for the purpo&s;e of collecting &s;cattered notices into a &s;ingle and uniform point of view, for the more exact in&s;pection of a topic which required a &s;eparate con&s;ideration, or for a comparative &s;urvey of the poetry of other nations.</P>
<P>A few years ago, Mr. MASON, with that liberality which ever accompanies true genius, gave me an authentic copy of Mr. POPE'S &s;cheme of a Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry, in which our poets were cla&s;&s;ed under their &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;pective &s;chools. The late lamented Mr. GRAY had al&s;o projected a work of this kind, and tran&s;lated &s;ome Runic odes for its illu&s;tration, now publi&s;hed: but &s;oon relinqui&s;hing the pro&s;ecution of a de&s;ign, which would have de|tained him from his own noble inventions, he mo&s;t obligingly conde&s;cended to favour me with the &s;ub|&s;tance of his plan, which I found to be that of Mr. POPE, con&s;iderably enlarged, extended, and improved.</P>
<P>It is vanity in me to have mentioned the&s;e com|munications. But I am apprehen&s;ive my vanity will ju&s;tly be thought much greater, when it &s;hall appear, that in giving the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h poetry,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
I have rejected the ideas of men who are its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ornaments. To confe&s;s the real truth, upon examination and experiment, I &s;oon di&s;covered their mode of treating my &s;ubject, plau&s;ible as it is, and brilliant in theory, to be attended with difficul|ties and inconveniencies, and productive of embara&s;&s;|ment both to the reader and the writer. Like other ingenious &s;y&s;tems, it &s;acrificed much u&s;eful intelli|gence to the ob&s;ervance of arrangement; and in the place of that &s;atisfaction which re&s;ults from a clearne&s;s and a fulne&s;s of information, &s;eemed only to &s;ub&s;ti|tute the merit of di&s;po&s;ition, and the prai&s;e of contri|vance. The con&s;traint impo&s;ed by a mechanical atten|tion to this di&s;tribution, appeared to me to de&s;troy that free exertion of re&s;earch with which &s;uch a hi&s;tory ought to be executed, and not ea&s;ily recon|cileable with that complication, variety, and extent of materials, which it ought to comprehend.</P>
<P>The method I have pur&s;ued, on one account at lea&s;t, &s;eems preferable to all others. My performance, in its pre&s;ent form, exhibits without tran&s;po&s;ition the gradual improvements of our poetry, at the &s;ame time that it uniformly repre&s;ents the progre&s;&s;ion of our language.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8">
Some perhaps will be of opinion, that the&s;e annals ought to have commenced with a view of the Saxon poetry. But be&s;ides that a legitimate illu&s;tration of that jejune and intricate &s;ubject would have almo&s;t doubled my labour, that the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are for the mo&s;t part little more than religious rhap&s;odies, and that &s;carce any compo&s;itions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan &s;tate, every reader that reflects but for a mo|ment on our political e&s;tabli&s;hment mu&s;t perceive, that the Saxon poetry has no connection with the nature and purpo&s;e of my pre&s;ent undertaking. Be|fore the Norman acce&s;&s;ion, which &s;ucceeded to the Saxon government, we were an unformed and an un&s;ettled race. That mighty revolution obliterated almo&s;t all relation to the former inhabitants of this i&s;land; and produced that &s;ignal change in our policy, con&s;titution, and public manners, the effects of which have reached modern times. The begin|ning of the&s;e annals &s;eems therefore to be mo&s;t properly dated from that era, when our national character began to dawn.</P>
<P>It was recommended to me, by a per&s;on eminent in the republic of letters, totally to exclude from
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
the&s;e volumes any mention of the Engli&s;h drama. I am very &s;en&s;ible that a ju&s;t hi&s;tory of our Stage is alone &s;ufficient to form an entire and exten&s;ive work; and this argument, which is by no means pre|cluded by the attempt here offered to the public, &s;till remains &s;eparately to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, at large, and in form. But as it was profe&s;&s;edly my intention to compri&s;e every &s;pecies of Engli&s;h Poetry, this, among the re&s;t, of cour&s;e claimed a place in the&s;e annals, and nece&s;&s;arily fell into my general de&s;ign. At the &s;ame time, as in this &s;ituation it could only become a &s;ubordinate object, it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould examine it with that critical preci|&s;ion and particularity, which &s;o large, &s;o curious, and &s;o important an article of our poetical literature demands and de&s;erves. To have con&s;idered it in its full extent, would have produced the unwieldy excre&s;cence of a di&s;proportionate epi&s;ode: not to have con&s;idered it at all, had been an omi&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t detract from the integrity of my intended plan. I flatter my&s;elf however, that from evidences hitherto unexplored, I have recovered hints which may facilitate the labours of tho&s;e, who &s;hall here|after be inclined to inve&s;tigate the antient &s;tate of dramatic exhibition in this country, with due com|prehen&s;ion and accuracy.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10">
It will probably be remarked, that the citations in the fir&s;t volume are numerous, and &s;ometimes very prolix. But it &s;hould be remembered, that mo&s;t of the&s;e are extracted from antient manu&s;cript poems never before printed, and hitherto but little known. Nor was it ea&s;y to illu&s;trate the darker and more di&s;tant periods of our poetry, without producing ample &s;pecimens. In the mean time, I hope to merit the thanks of the antiquarian, for enriching the &s;tock of our early literature by the&s;e new acce&s;&s;ions: and I tru&s;t I &s;hall gratify the reader of ta&s;te, in having &s;o fre|quently re&s;cued from oblivion the rude inventions and irregular beauties of the heroic tale, or the romantic legend.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the DISSERTATIONS is to prepare the reader, by con&s;idering apart, in a connected and comprehen&s;ive detail, &s;ome material points of a ge|neral and preliminary nature, and which could not either with equal propriety or convenience be intro|duced, at lea&s;t not &s;o formally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, in the body of the book; to e&s;tabli&s;h certain fundamental princi|ples to which frequent appeals might occa&s;ionally be made, and to clear the way for various ob&s;ervations ari&s;ing in the cour&s;e of my future enquiries.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE ORIGIN OF ROMANTIC FICTION in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DISSERTATION I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT peculiar and arbitrary &s;pecies of Fiction which we commonly call Romantic, was entirely unknown to the writers of Greece and Rome. It appears to have been imported into Europe by a people, who&s;e modes of thinking, and habits of invention, are not natural to that country. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been borrowed from the Arabians. But this origin has not been hitherto perhaps examined or a&s;certained with a &s;ufficient degree of accuracy. It is my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, by a more di&s;tinct and extended inquiry than has yet been applied to the &s;ubject, to trace the manner and the period of its introduction into the popular belief, the oral poetry, and the literature, of the Europeans.</P>
<P>It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of modern critici&s;m, that the fictions of Arabian imagination were communicated to the
<PB REF="16">
we&s;tern world by means of the cru&s;ades. Undoubtedly tho&s;e expeditions greatly contributed to propagate this mode of fabling in Europe. But it is evident, although a circum|&s;tance which certainly makes no material difference as to the principles here e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the&s;e fancies were intro|duced at a much earlier period. The Saracens, or Arabians, having been for &s;ome time &s;eated on the northern coa&s;ts of Africa, entered Spain about the beginning of the eighth cen|tury <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See ALMAKIN, edit. Pocock. p. 72.</NOTE>. Of this country they &s;oon effected a complete con|que&s;t: and impo&s;ing their religion, language, and cu&s;toms, upon the inhabitants, erected a royal &s;eat in the capital city of Cordoua.</P>
<P>That by means of this e&s;tabli&s;hment they fir&s;t revived the &s;ciences of Greece in Europe, will be proved at large in another place <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the &s;econd Di&s;&s;ertation.</NOTE>: and it is obvious to conclude, that at the &s;ame time they di&s;&s;eminated tho&s;e extravagant inventions which were &s;o peculiar to their romantic and creative genius. A manu&s;cript cited by Du Cange acquaints us, that the Spaniards, &s;oon after the irruption of the Saracens, entirely neglected the &s;tudy of the Latin language; and captivated with the novelty of the oriental books imported by the&s;e &s;trangers, &s;uddenly adopted an unu&s;ual pomp of &s;tyle, and an affected elevation of diction <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Arabico eloquio <HI>&s;ublimati,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> <BIBL>Du Cang. Glo&s;&s;. Med. Inf. Latinitat. tom. i. Praef. p. xxvii. &sect;. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>. The ideal tales of the&s;e ea&s;tern invaders, recommended by a brilliancy of de&s;crip|tion, a variety of imagery, and an exuberance of invention, hitherto unknown and unfamiliar to the cold and barren conceptions of a we&s;tern climate, were eagerly caught up, and univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed. From Spain, by the communica|tions of a con&s;tant commercial intercour&s;e through the ports of Toulon and Mar&s;eilles, they &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed into France and Italy.</P>
<P><PB REF="17" MS="y">
In France, no province, or di&s;trict, &s;eems to have given the&s;e fictions of the Arabians a more welcome or a more early reception, than the inhabitants of Armorica or Ba&s;&s;e Bretagne, now Britany; for no part of France can boa&s;t &s;o great a number of antient romances <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on on which this conclu&s;ion is founded will appear hereafter.</NOTE>.

<P>This de&s;cription of a chamber painted with Venus and the three my&s;teries of nature, and the allu&s;ion to Ovid, prove the tales before us to be of no very high antiquity.

<P>About the year 1100, Gualter, archdeacon of Oxford, a learned man, and a diligent collector of hi&s;tories, travelling through France, procured in Armorica an antient chronicle written in the Briti&s;h or Armorican language, entitled, BRUT|Y-BRENHINED, or THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRI|TAIN <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">In the curious library of the family of Davies at Llanerk in Denbigh&s;hire, there is a copy of this chronicle in the hand|writing of Guttyn Owen, a celebrated Wel&s;h bard and antiquarian about the year 1470, who a&s;cribes it to Ty&s;&s;ilio a bi&s;hop, and the &s;on of Brockmael-Y&s;cythroc prince of Powis. Ty&s;&s;ilio indeed wrote a HIS|TORY OF BRITAIN; but that work, as we are a&s;&s;ured by Lhuyd in the ARCHAEO|LOGIA, was entirely eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and has been long &s;ince lo&s;t.</NOTE>. This book he brought into England, and communi|cated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth, a Wel&s;h Benedictine monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably &s;killed in the Briti&s;h tongue.

<P>I am obliged to an ingenious antiqua|rian in Briti&s;h literature, Mr. Morris of Penbryn, for the following curious remarks concerning Geoffrey's original and his tran&s;|lation. <Q>"Geoffrey's SYLVIUS, in the Briti&s;h original, is SILIUS, which in Latin would make JULIUS. This il|lu&s;trates and confirms Lambarde's, BRU|TUS JULIUS. Peramb. Kent, p. 12. So al&s;o in the Briti&s;h bards. And hence Milton's objection is removed. Hi&s;t. Engl. p. 12. There are no FLAMINES or ARCHFLAMINES in the Briti&s;h book. See U&s;her's Primord. p. 57. Dubl. edit. There are very few &s;peeches in the ori|ginal, and tho&s;e very &s;hort. Geoffrey's FULGENIUS is in the Briti&s;h copy SU|LIEN, which by analogy in Latin would be JULIANUS. See Milton's Hi&s;t. Eng. p. 100. There is no LEIL in the Bri|ti&s;h; that king's name was LLEON. Geoffrey's CAERLISLE is in the Briti&s;h CAERLLEON, or We&s;t-Che&s;ter. In the Briti&s;h, LLAW AP CYNFARCH, &s;hould have been tran&s;lated LEO, which is now rendered LOTH. This has brought much confu&s;ion into the old Scotch hi&s;tory. I find no BELINUS in the Briti&s;h copy; the name is BELI, which &s;hould have been in Latin BELIUS, or BELGIUS. Geoffrey's BRENNUS in the original is BRAN, a common name among the Bri|tons; as BRAN AP DYFNWAL, &amp;c. See Suida's <GAP DESC="foreign">. It appears by the original, that the Briti&s;h name of CA|RAUSIUS was CARAWN; hence TRE|GARAUN, i. e. TREGARON, and the river CARAUN, which gives name to ABERCORN. In the Briti&s;h there is no divi&s;ion into books and chapters, a mark of antiquity. Tho&s;e whom the tran&s;|lator calls CONSULS of Rome, when Brennus took it, are in the original TWYSOGION, i. e. princes or generals. The Gwalen&s;es, GWALO, or GWALAS, are added by Geoffrey, B. xii. c. 19."</Q> To what is here ob&s;erved about SILIUS, I will add, that abbot Whetham&s;ted, in his MS. GRANARIUM, mentions SILOIUS the father of Brutus. <Q REND="inline">"Quomodo Brutus SILOII filius ad litora Angliae venit," &amp;c.</Q> <BIBL>GRANAR. Part. i. Lit. A. MSS. Cotton. NERO, C. vi. Brit.

The manu&s;cript in Je&s;us college library at Oxford, which Wynne pretends to be the &s;ame which Geoffrey him&s;elf made u&s;e of, is evidently not older than the &s;ixteenth century. Mr. Price, the Bodleian librarian, to who&s;e friend&s;hip this work is much indebted, has two copies lately given him by Mr. Banks, much more antient and perfect. But there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that mo&s;t of the Briti&s;h manu&s;cripts of this hi&s;tory are tran&s;lations from Geoffrey's Latin: for <HI>Britannia</HI> they have BRYTTAEN, which in the original would have been PRYDAIN. Geoffrey's tran&s;lation, and for obvious rea&s;ons, is a very common manu&s;cript. Compare Lhuyd's Arch. p. 265.</P></NOTE>.

It is difficult to a&s;certain exactly the period at which our tran&s;lator's original romance may probably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been compiled. Yet this is a curious &s;peculation, and will illu&s;trate our argument. I am inclined to think that the work con&s;i&s;ts of fables thrown out by different rhap|&s;odi&s;ts at different times, which afterwards were collected and dige&s;ted into an entire hi&s;tory, and perhaps with new decorations of fancy added by the compiler, who mo&s;t pro|bably was one of the profe&s;&s;ed bards, or rather a poetical hi&s;torian, of Armorica or Ba&s;&s;e Bretagne. In this &s;tate, and under this form, I &s;uppo&s;e it to have fallen into the hands of Geoffrey of Monmouth. If the hypothe&s;is hereafter ad|vanced concerning the particular &s;pecies of fiction on which this narrative is founded, &s;hould be granted, it cannot, from what I have already proved, be more antient than the eighth century: and we may rea&s;onably conclude, that it was compo&s;ed much later, as &s;ome con&s;iderable length of time mu&s;t have been nece&s;&s;ary for the propagation and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of that &s;pecies of fiction. The &s;imple &s;ubject of this chronicle, dive&s;ted of its romantic embelli&s;hments, is a de|duction of the Wel&s;h princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader, who reigned in the &s;eventh century <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This notion of their extraction from the Trojans had &s;o infatuated the Wel&s;h, that even &s;o late as the year 1284, arch|bi&s;hop Peckham, in his injunctions to the dioce&s;e of St. A&s;aph, orders the people to ab&s;tain from giving credit to idle dreams and vi&s;ions, a &s;uper&s;tition which they had contracted from their belief in thedream of their founder Brutus, in the temple of Diana, concerning his arrival in Britain. The archbi&s;hop very &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;es them to boa&s;t no more of their relation to the conquered and fugitive Trojans, but to glory in the victorious cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. Con|cil.

<PB REF="24">
be acknowledged, that many European nations were antiently fond of tracing their de&s;cent from Troy. Hunnibaldus Fran|cus, in his Latin hi&s;tory of France, written in the &s;ixth cen|tury, beginning with the Trojan war, and ending with Clovis the fir&s;t, a&s;cribes the origin of the French nation to Francio a &s;on of Priam <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">It is among the SCRIPTORES RER.

So univer&s;al was this humour, and car|ried to &s;uch an ab&s;urd exce&s;s of extravagance, that under the reign of Ju&s;tinian, even the Greeks were ambitious of being thought to be de&s;cended from the Trojans, their an|tient and notorious enemies. Unle&s;s we adopt the idea of tho&s;e antiquaries, who contend that Europe was peopled from Phrygia, it will be hard to di&s;cover at what period, or from what &s;ource, &s;o &s;trange and improbable a notion could take its ri&s;e, e&s;pecially among nations unacquainted with hi&s;tory, and overwhelmed in ignorance. The mo&s;t rational mode of accounting for it, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that the revival of Virgil's Eneid about the &s;ixth or &s;eventh century, which re|pre&s;ented the Trojans as the founders of Rome, the capital of the &s;upreme pontiff, and a city on various other accounts in the early ages of chri&s;tianity highly reverenced and di&s;|tingui&s;hed, occa&s;ioned an emulation in many other European nations of claiming an alliance to the &s;ame re&s;pectable origi|nal. The monks and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics, the only readers and writers of the age, were likely to broach, and were in|tere&s;ted in propagating, &s;uch an opinion. As the more bar|barous countries of Europe began to be tinctured with lite|rature, there was hardly one of them but fell into the fa&s;hion of deducing its original from &s;ome of the nations mo&s;t cele|brated in the antient books. Tho&s;e who did not a&s;pire &s;o

high as king Priam, or who found that claim preoccupied, boa&s;ted to be de&s;cended from &s;ome of the generals of Alexander the Great, from Pru&s;ias king of Bithynia, from the Greeks or the Egyptians. It it not in the mean time quite impro|bable, that as mo&s;t of the European nations were provincial to the Romans, tho&s;e who fancied them&s;elves to be of Trojan extraction might have imbibed this notion, at lea&s;t have ac|quired a general knowledge of the Trojan &s;tory, from their conquerors: more e&s;pecially the Britons, who continued &s;o long under the yoke of Rome <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See infr. SECT. iii. p. 127, 128.</NOTE>. But as to the &s;tory of Brutus in particular, Geoffrey's hero, it may be pre&s;umed that his legend was not contrived, nor the hi&s;tory of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors invented, till after the ninth century: for Nennius, who lived about the middle of that century, not only &s;peaks of Brutus with great ob&s;curity and incon&s;i&s;tency, but &s;eems totally uninformed as to every circum&s;tance of the Briti&s;h affairs which preceded Ce&s;ar's inva&s;ion.

It was not till tho&s;e memorable campaigns of mi&s;taken devotion had infatuated the we&s;tern world, that the &s;oldans or &s;ultans of Babylon, of Egypt, of Iconium, and other ea&s;tern kingdoms, became familiar in Europe.

On the whole we may venture to affirm, that this chronicle, &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the ideas of the Wel&s;h bards, entirely con&s;i&s;ts of Arabian inventions.

See Hi&s;t. Geneal. des Tartars, d'Abulgazi Bahadut Kh&acirc;n. p. 43. About the year 808, the caliph Al Amin having heard wonderful reports concerning this wall or barrier, &s;ent his interpreter Salam, with a guard of fifty men, to view it. After a dangerous journey of near two months, Salam and his party arrived in a de&s;olated country, where they beheld the ruins of many cities de&s;troyed by the people of Ja|jiouge and Majiouge. In &s;ix days more they reached the ca&s;tles near the mountain Kokaiya or Cauca&s;us. This mountain is inacce&s;&s;ibly &s;teep, perpetually covered with &s;nows and thick clouds, and encompa&s;&s;es the country of Jagiouge and Magiouge, which is full of cultivated fields and cities. At an opening of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mountain the fortre&s;s appears: and trave ling forwards, at the di&s;tance of two &s;tages, they found another mountain, with a ditch cut through it one hundred and fifty cubits wide; and within the aperture an iron gate fifty cubits high, &s;upported by va&s;t buttre&s;&s;es, having an iron bulwark crowned with iron turrets, reach|ing to the &s;ummit of the mountain it&s;elf, which is too high to be &s;een. The valves, lintels, thre&s;hold, bolts, lock and key, are all repre&s;ented of proportionable mag|nitude. The governor of the ca&s;tle above|mentioned, once in every week mounted on hor&s;eback with ten others on hor&s;eback, comes to this gate, and &s;triking it three times with a hammer weighing five pounds, and then li&s;tening, hears a murmuring noi&s;e from within. This noi&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the Jagiouge and Magiouge confined there. Salam was told that they often appeared on the battlements of the bulwark. He returned after pa&s;&s;ing twenty|eight months in this extraordinary expedi|tion. See Mod. Univ. Hi&s;t. vol. iv. B. i. &sect; 2. pag. 15. 16. 17. And Anc. vol. xx. pag. 23.

And although the long continuance of the cru&s;ades imported innumerable inventions of a &s;imilar complexion, and &s;ub&s;tituted the atchievements of new cham|pions and the wonders of other countries, yet the tales of Arthur and of Charlemagne, diver&s;ified indeed, or enlarged with additional embelli&s;hments, &s;till continued to prevail, and to be the favourite topics: and this, partly from their early popularity, partly from the quantity and the beauty of the fictions with which they were at fir&s;t &s;upported, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e the de&s;ign of the cru&s;ades had made tho&s;e &s;ubjects &s;o fa&s;hionable in which chri&s;tians fought with infi|dels.

<P>It is notorious, that many traces of oriental u&s;ages are found among&s;t all the European nations during their pagan &s;tate; and this phenomenon is rationally re&s;olved, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that all Europe was originally peopled from the ea&s;t. But as the re&s;emblance which the pagan Scandina|vians bore to the ea&s;tern nations in manners, monu|ments, opinions, and practices, is &s;o very perceptible and apparent, an inference ari&s;es, that their migration from the ea&s;t mu&s;t have happened at a period by many ages more recent, and therefore mo&s;t probably about the time &s;pecified by their hi&s;torians. In the mean time we mu&s;t re|member, that a di&s;tinction is to be made between this expe|dition of Odin's Goths, who formed a &s;ettlement in Scandi|navia, and tho&s;e innumerable armies of barbarous adventu|rers, who &s;ome centuries afterwards, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame name, at different periods overwhelmed Europe, and at length extingui&s;hed the Roman empire.</P>

When ob|vious terms and phra&s;es evidently occurred, the Runic poets are fond of departing from the common and e&s;tabli&s;hed dic|tion.

<P>The&s;e Scandinavian bards appear to have been e&s;teemed and entertained in other countries be&s;ides their own, and by that means to have probably communicated their fictions to various parts of Europe. I will give my rea&s;ons for this &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the early ages of Europe, before many regular govern|ments took place, revolutions, emigrations, and inva&s;ions, were frequent and almo&s;t univer&s;al. Nations were alternately
<PB REF="47">
de&s;troyed or formed; and the want of political &s;ecurity expo&s;ed the inhabitants of every country to a &s;tate of eternal fluctuation. That Britain was originally peopled from Gaul, a nation of the Celts, is allowed: but that many colonies from the northern parts of Europe were afterwards &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively planted in Britain and the neighbouring i&s;lands, is an hypothe&s;is equally rational, and not altogether de&s;titute of hi&s;torical evidence. Nor was any nation more likely than the Scandinavian Goths, I mean in their early periods, to make de&s;cents on Britain. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit of adventure in an eminent degree. They were habituated to dangerous enterpri&s;es. They were acquainted with di&s;tant coa&s;ts, exerci&s;ed in navigation, and fond of making expe|ditions, in hopes of conque&s;t, and in &s;earch of new acqui|&s;itions. As to Scotland and Ireland, there is the highe&s;t probability, that the Scutes, who conquered both tho&s;e coun|tries, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them under the names of Albin Scutes and Irin Scutes, were a people of Norway. The Caledo|nians are expre&s;sly called by many judicious antiquaries a Scandinavian colony. The names of places and per&s;ons, over all that part of Scotland which the Picts inhabited, are of Scandinavian extraction. A &s;imple catalogue of them only, would immediately convince us, that they are not of Celtic, or Briti&s;h, origin. Flaherty reports it as a re|ceived opinion, and a general doctrine, that the Picts mi|grated into Britain and Ireland from Scandinavia <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>It is conjectured by Wormius, that <HI>Ire|land</HI> is derived from the Runic Yr, a bow, for the u&s;e of which the Iri&s;h were once famous.

&s;ubject in its full extent, which is here only intro|duced incidentally. I will only add, that Scotland and Ire|land, as being &s;ituated more to the north, and probably le&s;s difficult of acce&s;s than Britain, might have been objects on which our northern adventurers were invited to try &s;ome of their earlie&s;t excur&s;ions: and that the Orkney-i&s;lands remained long under the juri&s;diction of the Norwegian potentates.</P>
<P>In the&s;e expeditions, the northern emigrants, as we &s;hall prove more particularly below, were undoubtedly attended by their &s;calds or poets. Yet even in times of peace, and without the &s;uppo&s;ition of conque&s;t or inva&s;ion, the Scan|dinavian &s;calds might have been well known in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;pecious and plea&s;ing talent, they fre|quented the courts of the Briti&s;h, Scotti&s;h, and Iri&s;h chief|tains. They were itinerants by their in&s;titution, and made voyages, out of curio&s;ity, or in que&s;t of rewards, to tho&s;e i&s;lands or coa&s;ts which lay within the circle of their mari|time knowledge. By the&s;e means, they e&s;tabli&s;hed an in|tere&s;t, rendered their profe&s;&s;ion popular, propagated their art, and circulated their fictions, in other countries, and at a di&s;tance from home. Torfaeus a&s;&s;erts po&s;itively, that various I&s;landic odes now remain, which were &s;ung by the Scandinavian bards before the kings of England and Ireland, and for which they received liberal gratuities <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Torf.

They were more e&s;pecially care&s;&s;ed and rewarded at the courts of tho&s;e princes, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their warlike character, and their pa&s;&s;ion for military glory.</P>

What is &s;aid in the text mu&s;t have greatly facilitated the Saxon and Dani&s;h conque&s;ts in England. The works of the genuine Caedmon are written in the lan|guage of the antient Angles, who were nearly connected with the Jutes. Hence that language re&s;embled the antient Dani&s;h, as appears from pa&s;&s;ages of Caedmon cited by Wanley. Hence al&s;o it happened, that the later Dano-Saxonic dialect, in which Junius's POETICAL PARAPHRASE OF GENESIS was written, is likewi&s;e &s;o very &s;imilar to the language of the antient Angles, who &s;ettled in the more northern parts of England. And in this dialect, which indeed prevailed in &s;ome degree almo&s;t over all England, many other poems are compo&s;ed, mentioned likewi&s;e in Wan|ley's Catalogue. It is the con&s;tant doctrine of the Dani&s;h hi&s;torians, that the Danes and Angles, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors gave the name to this i&s;land, had the &s;ame origin.</NOTE>. Indeed it may be naturally concluded from the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, that the Scandinavian tongue became fami|liar in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands by the &s;ongs of the &s;calds: unle&s;s it be rather pre&s;umed, that a previous knowledge of that tongue in Britain was the means of facilitating the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e poets, and preparing the way for their reception.</P>
<P>And here it will be much to our pre&s;ent argument to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome of the old Gothic and Scandinavian &s;u|per&s;titions are to this day retained in the Engli&s;h language.

In the year 938, Anlaff, a pagan king of the Hybernians and the adjacent i&s;les, invited by Con&s;tantine king of the Scots, en|tered the river Abi or Humber with a &s;trong fleet. Our Saxon king Athel&s;tan, and his brother Eadmund Clito, met them with a numerous army, near a place called Brunen|burgh; and after a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and bloody re&s;i&s;tance, drove them back to their &s;hips. The battle la&s;ted from day|break till the evening. On the &s;ide of Anlaff were &s;lain &s;ix petty kings, and &s;even chiefs or generals. <Q>"King Adel&s;tan, the glory of leaders, the giver of gold chains to his nobles, and his brother Eadmund, both &s;hining with the bright|ne&s;s of a long train of ance&s;tors, &s;truck [the adver&s;ary] in war; at Brunenburgh, with the edge of the &s;word, they clove the wall of &s;hields. The high banners fell. The earls of the departed Edward fell; for it was born within them, even from the loins of their kindred, to defend the trea&s;ures and the hou&s;es of their country, and
<PB REF="53">
their gifts, again&s;t the hatred of &s;trangers. The nation of the Scots, and the fatal inhabitants of &s;hips, fell. The hills re&s;ounded, and the armed men were covered with &s;weat. From the time the &s;un, the king of &s;tars, the torch of the eternal one, ro&s;e chearful above the hills, till he returned to his habitation. There lay many of the northern men, pierced with lances; they lay wounded, with their &s;hields pierced through: and al&s;o the Scots, the hateful harve&s;t of battle. The cho&s;en bands of the We&s;t-Saxons, going out to battle, pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;teps of the dete&s;ted nations, and &s;lew their flying rear with &s;harp and bloody &s;words. The &s;oft effeminate men yielded up their &s;pears. The Mercians did not fear or fly the rough game of the hand. There was no &s;afety to them, who &s;ought the land with Anlaff in the bo&s;om of the &s;hip, to die in fight. Five youthful kings fell in the place of fight, &s;lain with &s;words; and &s;even captains of Anlaff, with the innumerable army of Scotti&s;h mariners: there the lord of the Normans [Northern-men] was cha&s;ed; and their army, now made &s;mall, was driven to the prow of the &s;hip. The &s;hip &s;ounded with the waves; and the king, marching into the yellow &s;ea, e&s;caped alive. And &s;o it was, the wi&s;e northern king Con&s;tantine, a veteran chief, returning by flight to his own army, bowed down in the camp, left his own &s;on worn out with wounds in the place of &s;laughter; in vain did he lament his earls, in vain his lo&s;t friends. Nor le&s;s did Anlaff, the yellow|haired leader, the battle-ax of &s;laughter, a youth in war, but an old man in under&s;tanding, boa&s;t him&s;elf a con|queror in fight, when the darts flew again&s;t Edward's earls, and their banners met. Then tho&s;e northern &s;ol|diers, covered with &s;hame, the &s;ad refu&s;e of darts in the re&s;ounding whirlpool of Humber, departed in their &s;hips with rudders, to &s;eek through the deep the Iri&s;h city and their own land. While both the brothers, the

king and Clito, lamenting even their own victory, toge|ther returned home; leaving behind them the fle&s;h-de|vouring raven, the dark-blue toad greedy of &s;laughter, the black crow with horny bill, and the hoar&s;e toad, the eagle a companion of battles with the devouring kite, and that brindled &s;avage bea&s;t the wolf of the wood, to be glutted with the white food of the &s;lain. Never was &s;o great a &s;laughter in this i&s;land, &s;ince the Angles and Saxons, the fierce beginners of war, coming hither from the ea&s;t, and &s;eeking Britain through the wide &s;ea, over|came the Britons excelling in honour, and gained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their land <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The original was fir&s;t printed by Whe|loc in the Saxon Chronicle, p. 555.

<P>This piece, and many other Saxon odes and &s;ongs now remaining, are written in a metre much re&s;embling that of the &s;caldic dialogue at the tomb of Angantyr, which has been beautifully tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, in the true &s;pirit of the original, and in a genuine &s;train of poetry, by Gray.

Their ver&s;ification for the mo&s;t part &s;eems to have been that of the Runic poetry.</P>
<P>As literature, the certain attendant, as it is the parent, of true religion and civility, gained ground among the Saxons, poetry no longer remained a &s;eparate &s;cience, and the profe&s;&s;ion of bard &s;eems gradually to have declined among them: I mean the bard under tho&s;e appropriated characteri&s;tics, and that peculiar appointment, which he &s;u&s;tained among the Scandinavian pagans. Yet their na|tional love of ver&s;e and mu&s;ic &s;till &s;o &s;trongly predominated, that in the place of their old &s;calders a new rank of poets aro&s;e, called GLEEMEN or Harpers <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>GLEEMAN an&s;wers to the Latin JO|CULATOR.

<P>And here I &s;top to point out one of the principal rea&s;ons, why the Scandinavian bards have tran&s;mitted to modern times &s;o much more of their native poetry, than the re&s;t of their &s;outhern neighbours. It is true, that the inhabitants of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, whether or no from their A&s;iatic origin, from their poverty which compelled them to &s;eek fortunes at foreign courts by the exerci&s;e of a popular art, from the &s;ucce&s;s of their bards, the nature of their republican government, or their habits of un&s;ettled life, were more given to ver&s;e than any other Gothic, or even Celtic, tribe. But this is not all: they re|mained pagans, and retained their original manners, much longer than any of their Gothic kindred. They were not completely converted to chri&s;tianity till the tenth century <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See bi&s;hop Lloyd's Hi&s;t. Account of Church Government in Great Britain, &amp;c. chap. i. &sect;. 11. pag. 4to. Lond. 1684. And Crymog. Arngrim. L. i. cap. 10. p. 104.</NOTE>. Hence, under the concurrence however of &s;ome of the cau&s;es ju&s;t mentioned, their &s;caldic profe&s;&s;ion acquired greater degrees of &s;trength and of maturity: and from an uninterrupted po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion through many ages of the mo&s;t romantic religious &s;uper&s;titions, and the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e rough manners which are &s;o favourable to the poetical &s;pirit, was enabled to produce, not only more genuine, but more numerous, compo|&s;itions. True religion would have checked the impetuo&s;ity of their pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their wild exertions of fancy, and bani&s;hed that &s;triking train of imagery, which their
<PB REF="56">
poetry derived from a barbarous theology. This circum|&s;tance al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ts to our con&s;ideration, tho&s;e &s;uperior advantages and opportunities ari&s;ing from lei&s;ure and length of time, which they enjoyed above others, of circulating their poetry far and wide, of giving a general currency to their mode of fabling, of rendering their &s;kill in ver&s;ifica|tion more univer&s;ally and familiarly known, and a more con&s;picuous and popular object of admiration or imitation to the neighbouring countries. Hence too it has happened, that modern times have not only attained much fuller information concerning their hi&s;torical tran&s;actions, but are &s;o intimately acquainted with the peculiarities of their character.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions produced a con|&s;iderable alteration in the manners of our Anglo-Saxon an|ce&s;tors. Although their connections with England were tran&s;ient and interrupted, and on the whole &s;carcely la&s;ted two hundred years, yet many of the Dani&s;h cu&s;toms began to prevail among the inhabitants, which &s;eem to have given a new turn to their temper and genius. The Dani&s;h fa&s;hion of exce&s;&s;ive drinking, for in&s;tance, a vice almo&s;t natural to the northern nations, became &s;o general among the Anglo-Saxons, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train &s;o pernicious and contagious a practice by a particular &s;tatute <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Lambarde's Archaionom. And Bartholin. ii. c. xii. p. 542.</NOTE>. Hence it &s;eems likely, that &s;o popular an entertainment as their poetry gained ground; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that in their expeditions again&s;t England they were of cour&s;e attended by many northern &s;calds, who con&s;tantly made a part of their military retinue, and who&s;e language was under&s;tood by the Saxons. Rogwald, lord of the Orcades, who was al&s;o him&s;elf a poet, going on an expedition into Pale&s;tine, carried with him two I&s;landic bards <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">^g Ol. Worm. Lit.

That &s;calds were common in the Dani&s;h armies when they invaded England, appears from a &s;tratagem of Alfred; who, availing him&s;elf of his &s;kill in oral poetry and playing on the harp, entered the Dani&s;h camp habited in that character, and procured a ho&s;pitable reception.

As Anlaff's dialect mu&s;t have di&s;covered him to have been a Dane; here is a proof, of what I &s;hall bring more, that the Saxons, even in the mid&s;t of mutual ho&s;tilities, treated the Dani&s;h &s;calds with favour and re&s;pect. That the I&s;landic bards were com|mon in England during the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions, there are numerous proofs. Egill, a celebrated I&s;landic poet, having murthered the &s;on and many of the friends of Eric Blodoxe, king of Denmark or Norway, then re&s;iding in Northum|berland, and which he had ju&s;t conquered, procured a pardon by &s;inging before the king, at the command of his queen Gunhilde, an extemporaneous ode <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Crymogr.

Egill, although of the enemy's party, was a &s;ingular favourite of king Athel&s;tan. Athel&s;tan once a&s;ked Egill how he e&s;caped due puni&s;hment from Eric Blodoxe, the king of Northumberland, for the very capital and enormous crime which I have ju&s;t mentioned. On which Egill immediately related the whole of that tran&s;action to the Saxon king, in a &s;ublime ode &s;till extant <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Torfaeus Hi&s;t. Orcad.

On another occa&s;ion Athel&s;tan pre&s;ented Egill with two rings, and two large cabinets filled with &s;ilver; promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, to grant him any gift or favour which he &s;hould chu&s;e to reque&s;t. Egill, &s;truck with gratitude, immediately compo&s;ed a panegyrical poem in the Norwegian language, then com|mon to both nations, on the virtues of Athel&s;tan, which the latter as generou&s;ly requited with two marcs of pure gold <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Crymog. Arn. Jon. p. 129. ut &s;upr.</NOTE>. Here is likewi&s;e another argument that the Saxons had no &s;mall e&s;teem for the &s;caldic poetry. It is highly rea|&s;onable to conjecture, that our Dani&s;h king Canute; a po|tentate of mo&s;t exten&s;ive juri&s;diction, and not only king of
<PB REF="60">
England, but of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, was not without the cu&s;tomary retinue of the northern courts, in which the &s;calds held &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed and important a &s;ta|tion. Human nature, in a &s;avage &s;tate, a&s;pires to &s;ome &s;pecies of merit; and in every &s;tage of &s;ociety is alike &s;u&s;cep|tible of flattery, when addre&s;&s;ed to the reigning pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ole object of the&s;e northern princes was military glory. It is certain that Canute delighted in this mode of entertain|ment, which he patroni&s;ed and liberally rewarded. It is related in KNYTLINGA-SAGA, or Canute's Hi&s;tory, that he commanded the &s;cald Loftunga to be put to death, for daring to comprehend his atchievements in too conci&s;e a poem. <Q REND="inline">"Nemo, &s;aid he, ante te, au&s;us e&s;t de me BREVES CANTILENAS componere."</Q> A curious picture of the tyrant, the patron, and the barbarian, united! But the bard extorted a &s;peedy pardon, and with much addre&s;s, by producing the next day before the king at dinner an ode of more than thirty &s;trophes, for which Canute gave him fifty marcs of purified &s;ilver <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bartholin.

<P>The &s;ongs of the Iri&s;h bards are by &s;ome conceived to be &s;trongly marked with the traces of &s;caldic imagination; and the&s;e traces, which will be recon&s;idered, are believed &s;till to &s;urvive among a &s;pecies of poetical hi&s;torians, whom they call TALE-TELLERS, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the de&s;cendants of the original Iri&s;h bards <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>We are informed by the Iri&s;h hi&s;to|rians, that &s;aint Patrick, when he converted Ireland to the Chri&s;tian faith, de&s;troyed three hundred volumes of the &s;ongs of the Iri&s;h bards. Such was their dignity in this country, that they were permitted to wear a robe of the &s;ame colour with that of the royal family. They were con&s;tantly &s;um|moned to a triennial fe&s;tival: and the mo&s;t approved &s;ongs delivered at this a&s;&s;embly were ordered to be pre&s;erved in the cu&s;tody of the king's hi&s;torian or antiquary. Many of the&s;e compo&s;itions are referred to by Keating, as the foundation of his hi&s;tory of Ireland. Ample e&s;tates were appro|priated to them, that they might live in a condition of independence and ea&s;e. The profe&s;&s;ion was hereditary: but when a bard died, his e&s;tate devolved not to his elde&s;t &s;on, but to &s;uch of his family as di&s;covered the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed talents for poetry and mu&s;ic. Every principal bard retained thirty of inferior note, as his attendants; and a bard of the &s;econdary cla&s;s was fol|lowed by a retinue of fifteen.

<P>Nor is it improbable that the Wel&s;h bards <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>The bards of Britain were originally a con&s;titutional appendage of the druidical hierarchy. In the pari&s;h of Llanidan in the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, there are &s;till to be &s;een the ruins of an arch-druid's man&s;ion, which they call TRER DREW, that is the DRUID'S MANSION.

Among the&s;e is TRER BEIRD, or, as they call it to this day, the HAMLET OF THE BARDS. Row|lands's MONA, p. 83. 88. But &s;o &s;trong was the attachment of the Celtic nations, among which we reckon Britain, to poetry, that, amid&s;t all the changes of government and manners, even long after the order of Druids was extinct, and the national reli|gion altered, the bards, acquiring a &s;ort of civil capacity, and a new e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, &s;till continued to flouri&s;h. And with regard to Britain, the bards flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in tho&s;e parts of it, which mo&s;t &s;trongly retained their native Celtic character. The Britons living in tho&s;e countries that were between the Trent or Humber and the Thames, by far the greate&s;t portion of this i&s;land, in the mid&s;t of the Roman garri&s;ons and colonies, had been &s;o long inured to the cu&s;toms of the Romans, that they pre|&s;erved very little of the Briti&s;h; and from this long and habitual intercour&s;e, before the fifth century, they &s;eem to have lo&s;t their original language. We cannot di&s;|cover the &s;lighte&s;t trace, in the poems of the bards, the LIVES of the Briti&s;h &s;aints, or any other antient monument, that they held any corre&s;pondence with the Wel&s;h, the Corni&s;h, the Cumbrian, or the Strath|cluyd Britons.

<P>And here we &s;ee the rea&s;on why the Wel&s;h bards flouri&s;hed &s;o much and &s;o long. But moreover the Wel&s;h, kept in awe as they were by the Romans, harra&s;&s;ed by the Saxons, and eternally jealous of the attacks, the encroachments, and the neigh|bourhood of aliens, were on this account attached to their Celtic manners: this &s;itua|tion, and the&s;e circum&s;tances, in&s;pired them with a pride and an ob&s;tinacy for man|taining a national di&s;tinction, and for pre|&s;erving their antient u&s;ages, among which the bardic profe&s;&s;ion is &s;o eminent.</P></NOTE> might have been acquainted with the Scandinavian &s;calds.

<P>The caliphs, and other ea&s;tern potentates, had their bards: whom they treated with equal re&s;pect.

Leo Afer mentions the <HI>Poetae curiae</HI> of the Caliph's court at Bag|dad, about the year 990. De Med. et Philo&s;. Arab. cap. iv. Tho&s;e poets were in mo&s;t repute among the Arabians, who could &s;peak extemporaneous ver&s;es to the Caliph. Eu&s;eb. Renaudot. apud Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xiii. p. 249.

And Maundeville men|tions MINSTRELLES as e&s;tabli&s;hed officers in the court of the emperor of Cathay.</P></NOTE>. Nor mu&s;t I pa&s;s over, what reflects much light on this rea&s;oning, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the hou&s;hold of the old Iri&s;h chiefs, exactly re&s;embles that of the Wel&s;h kings. For, be&s;ides the bard, the mu&s;ician, and the &s;mith, they have both a phy&s;ician, a hunt&s;man, and other corre&s;ponding officers <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Temple, ubi &s;upr. p. 346.</NOTE>. We mu&s;t al&s;o remember, that an intercour&s;e was nece&s;&s;arily produced between the Wel&s;h and Scandinavians, from the piratical irruptions of the latter: their &s;calds, as I have already remarked, were re&s;pected and patroni&s;ed in the courts of tho&s;e princes, who&s;e territories were the prin|cipal objects of the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions. Torfaeus expre&s;sly affirms this of the Anglo-Saxon and Iri&s;h kings; and it is
<PB REF="66">
at lea&s;t probable, that they were entertained with equal re|gard by the Wel&s;h princes, who &s;o frequently concurred with the Danes in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h. It may be added, that the Wel&s;h, although living in a &s;eparate and detached &s;ituation, and &s;o &s;trongly prejudiced in favour of their own u&s;ages, yet from neighbourhood, and unavoidable communications of various kinds, might have imbibed the ideas of the Scandinavian bards from the Saxons and Danes, after tho&s;e nations had occupied and over&s;pread all the other parts of our i&s;land.</P>
<P>Many pieces of the Scotti&s;h bards are &s;till remaining in the high-lands of Scotland. Of the&s;e a curious &s;pecimen, and which con&s;idered in a more exten&s;ive and general re&s;pect, is a valuable monument of the poetry of a rude period, has lately been given to the world, under the title of the WORKS OF OSSIAN. It is indeed very remarkable, that in the&s;e poems, the terrible graces, which &s;o naturally characteri&s;e, and &s;o generally con&s;titute, the early poetry of a barbarous people, &s;hould &s;o frequently give place to a gentler &s;et of manners, to the &s;ocial &s;en&s;ibilities of poli&s;hed life, and a more civili&s;ed and elegant &s;pecies of imagination. Nor is this circum&s;tance, which di&s;arranges all our e&s;tabli&s;hed ideas concerning the &s;avage &s;tages of &s;ociety, ea&s;ily to be accounted for, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that the Celtic tribes, who were &s;o &s;trongly addicted to poetical compo&s;ition, and who made it &s;o much their &s;tudy from the earlie&s;t times, might by de|grees have attained a higher vein of poetical refinement, than could at fir&s;t &s;ight or on common principles be expected among nations, whom we are accu&s;tomed to call barbarous; that &s;ome few in&s;tances of an elevated &s;train of friend&s;hip, of love, and other &s;entimental feelings, ex|i&s;ting in &s;uch nations, might lay the foundation for intro|ducing a &s;et of manners among the bards, more refined and exalted than the real manners of the country: and that panegyrics on tho&s;e virtues, tran&s;mitted with improvements
<PB REF="67">
from bard to bard, mu&s;t at length have formed characters of ideal excellence, which might propagate among the peo|ple real manners bordering on the poetical. The&s;e poems, however, notwith&s;tanding the difference between the Gothic and the Celtic rituals, contain many vi&s;ible ve&s;tiges of Scan|dinavian &s;uper&s;tition. The allu&s;ions in the &s;ongs of O&s;&s;ian to &s;pirits, who pre&s;ide over the different parts and direct the various operations of nature, who &s;end &s;torms over the deep, and rejoice in the &s;hrieks of the &s;hipwrecked mariner, who call down lightning to bla&s;t the fore&s;t or cleave the rock, and diffu&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible pe&s;tilence among the people, beautifully conducted indeed, and heightened, under the &s;kilful hand of a ma&s;ter bard, entirely corre&s;pond with the Runic &s;y&s;tem, and breathe the &s;pirit of its poetry. One fiction in particular, the mo&s;t EXTRAVAGANT in all O&s;&s;ian's poems, is founded on an e&s;&s;ential article of the Runic belief. It is where Fingal fights with the &s;pirit of Loda. Nothing could aggrandi&s;e Fingal's heroi&s;m more highly than this marvellous encounter. It was e&s;teemed among the antient Danes the mo&s;t daring act of courage to engage with a gho&s;t <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. De Contemptu Mortis apud Dan. L. ii. c. 2. p. 258.

Le&s;s horrible and gro&s;s, they had a novelty, a variety, and a magnificence, which carried with them the charm of fa&s;cination. Yet it is probable, that many of the &s;caldic imaginations might have been blended with the Arabian. In the mean time, there is great rea&s;on to believe, that the Gothic &s;calds enriched their vein of fabling from this new and fruitful &s;ource of fiction, opened by the Arabians in Spain, and afterwards propagated by the cru&s;ades.

<P>Let me add, that the inchantments of the Runic poetry are very different from tho&s;e in our romances of chivalry. The former chiefly deal in &s;pells and charms, &s;uch as would pre&s;erve from poi&s;on, blunt the weapons of an enemy, pro|cure victory, allay a tempe&s;t, cure bodily di&s;ea&s;es, or call the dead from their tombs: in uttering a form of my&s;terious words, or in&s;cribing Runic characters. The magicians of romance are chiefly employed in forming and conducting a train of deceptions. There is an air of barbaric horror in the
<PB REF="75">
incantations of the &s;caldic fablers: the magicians of romance often pre&s;ent vi&s;ions of plea&s;ure and delight; and, although not without their alarming terrors, &s;ometimes lead us through flowery fore&s;ts, and rai&s;e up palaces glittering with gold and precious &s;tones. The Runic magic is more like that of Canidia in Horace, the romantic re&s;embles that of Armida in Ta&s;&s;o.

<P>It is al&s;o remarkable, that in the earlier &s;caldic odes, we find but few dragons, giants, and fairies. The&s;e were intro|duced afterwards, and are the progeny of Arabian fancy. Nor indeed do the&s;e imaginary beings often occur in any of the compo&s;itions which preceded the introduction of that &s;pecies of fabling. On this rea&s;oning, the Iri&s;h tale-teller mentioned above, could not be a lineal de&s;cendant of the elder Iri&s;h bards. The ab&s;ence of giants and dragons, and, let me add, of many other traces of that fanta&s;tic and bril|liant imagery which compo&s;es the &s;y&s;tem of Arabian ima|gination, from the poems of O&s;&s;ian, are a &s;triking proof of their antiquity. It has already been &s;ugge&s;ted, at what period, and from what origin, tho&s;e fancies got footing in the Wel&s;h poetry: we do not find them in the odes of Talie&s;&s;in or Aneurin <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Who flouri&s;hed about the year 570. He has left a long &s;pirited poem called GO|DODIN, often alluded to by the later Wel&s;h bards, which celebrates a battle fought again&s;t the Saxons near Cattraeth, under the conduct of Mynnydawe Eiddin, in which all the Britons, three only ex|cepted, among which was the bard Aneurin him&s;elf, were &s;lain. I will give a &s;pecimen. <Q REND="inline">"The men who&s;e drink was mead, comely in &s;hape, ha&s;tened to Cattraeth. The&s;e impetuous warriors in ranks, armed with red &s;pears, long and bending, began the battle. Might I &s;peak my revenge again&s;t the people of the Deiri, I would overwhelm them, like a deluge, in one &s;laughter: for unheeding I have lo&s;t a friend, who was brave in re&s;i&s;ting his enemies. I drank of the wine and metheglin of Mordai, who&s;e &s;pear was of huge &s;ize. In the &s;hock of the battle, he prepared food for the eagle. When Cydwal ha&s;tened forward, a &s;hout aro&s;e: before the yellow morning, when he gave the &s;ignal, he broke the &s;hield into &s;mall &s;plinters. The men ha&s;tened to Cattraeth, noble in birth: their drink was wine and mead, out of golden cups. There were three hundred and &s;ixty three adorned with chains of gold; but of tho&s;e, who filled with wine, ru&s;hed on to the fight, only three e&s;caped, who hewed their way with the &s;word, the warrior of Acron, Conan Dacarawd, and I the bard Aneurin, red with blood, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have &s;urvived to compo&s;e this &s;ong. When Caradoc ha&s;tened to the war, he was the &s;on of a wild boar, in hewing down the Saxons; a bull in the conflict of fight, he twi&s;ted the wood [&s;pear] from their hands. Gurien &s;aw not his father after he had lifted the gli&s;tening mead in his hand. I prai&s;e all the warriors who thus met in the battle, and attacked the foe with one mind. Their life was &s;hort, but they have left a long regret to their friends. Yet of the Saxons they &s;lew more than &s;even ..... There was many a mo|ther &s;hedding tears. The &s;ong is due to thee who ha&s;t attained the highe&s;t glory: thou who wa&s;t like fire, thunder and &s;torm: O Rudd Fedell, warlike champion, excellent in might, you &s;till think of the war. The noble chiefs de&s;erve to be celebrated in ver&s;e, who after the fight made the rivers to over|flow their banks with blood. Their hands glutted the throats of the dark|brown eagles, and &s;kilfully prepared food for the ravenous birds. Of all the chiefs who went to Cattraeth with golden chains,"</Q> &amp;c.

And, to return to the ground of this argument, there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that even the Gothic EDDA, or &s;y&s;tem of poetic mythology of the northern nations, is enriched with tho&s;e higher &s;trokes of oriental imagination, which the Arabians had communicated to the Europeans. Into this extravagant ti&s;&s;ue of unmeaning allegory, fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, and fal&s;e theology, it was ea&s;y to incorporate their mo&s;t wild and romantic conceptions <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>Huet is of opinion, that the EDDA is entirely the production of Snorro's fancy. But this is &s;aying too much. See Orig. Roman. p. 116. The fir&s;t Edda was com|piled, undoubtedly with many additions and interpolations, from fictions and tra|ditions in the old Runic poems, by Soe|mund Sigfu&s;&s;on, &s;urnamed the Learned, about the year 1057.

<P>It is certain, and very ob&s;ervable, that in the EDDA we find much more of giants, dragons, and other imaginary be|ings, undoubtedly belonging to Arabian romance, then in the earlier Scaldic odes.

It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the ideas of chivalry, the appen|dage and the &s;ubject of romance, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the Goths. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood under certain limitations. There is no peculiarity which more &s;trongly di&s;criminates the manners of the Greeks and Romans from tho&s;e of modern times, than that &s;mall degree of attention and re|&s;pect with which tho&s;e nations treated the fair &s;ex, and that incon&s;iderable &s;hare which they were permitted to take in conver&s;ation, and the general commerce of life. For the truth of this ob&s;ervation, we need only appeal to the cla&s;&s;ic writers: in which their women appear to have been devoted to a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion and ob&s;curity. One is &s;urpri&s;ed that barbarians &s;hould be greater ma&s;ters of complai&s;ance than the mo&s;t poli&s;hed people that ever exi&s;ted. No &s;ooner was the Roman empire overthrown, and the Goths had over|powered Europe, than we find the female character a&s;&s;uming an unu&s;ual importance and authority, and di&s;tingui&s;hed with new privileges, in all the European governments e&s;tabli&s;hed by the northern conquerors. Even amid&s;t the confu&s;ions of &s;avage war, and among the almo&s;t incredible enormities committed by the Goths at their inva&s;ion of the empire, they forbore to offer any violence to the women. This perhaps is one of the mo&s;t &s;triking features in the new &s;tate of manners, which took place about the &s;eventh century: and it is to this period, and to this people, that we mu&s;t refer the origin of gallantry in Europe.

<P>But the deference paid to the fair &s;ex, which produced the &s;pirit of gallantry, is chiefly to be &s;ought for in tho&s;e &s;trong and exaggerated ideas of female cha&s;tity which prevailed among the northern nations. Hence the lover's devotion to his mi&s;tre&s;s was encrea&s;ed, his attentions to her &s;ervice multiplied, his affection heightened, and his &s;ollicitude ag|gravated, in proportion as the difficulty of obtaining her was enhanced: and the pa&s;&s;ion of love acquired a degree of delicacy, when controlled by the principles of honour and purity. The highe&s;t excellence of character then known was a &s;uperiority in arms; and that rival was mo&s;t likely to gain his lady's regard, who was the brave&s;t champion. Here we &s;ee valour in&s;pired by love. In the mean time, the &s;ame heroic &s;pirit which was the &s;ure&s;t claim to the favour of the ladies, was often exerted in their protection: a protection much wanted in an age of rapine, of plunder, and piracy; when the weakne&s;s of the &s;ofter &s;ex was expo&s;ed to conti|nual dangers and unexpected attacks <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See in&s;tances of this &s;ort of violence in the antient HISTORY of HIALMAR, a Runic romance, p. 135. 136. 140.

<P>Among the Scandinavians, a people &s;o fond of cloathing adventures in ver&s;e, the&s;e gallantries mu&s;t naturally become the &s;ubject of poetry, with its fictitious embelli&s;hments. Accordingly, we find their chivalry di&s;played in their odes; pieces, which at the &s;ame time greatly confirm the&s;e ob&s;er|vations. The famous ode of Regner Lodbrog, affords a &s;triking in&s;tance; in which, being impri&s;oned in a loath|&s;ome dungeon, and condemned to be de&s;troyed by venomous &s;erpents, he &s;olaces his de&s;perate &s;ituation by recollecting and reciting the glorious exploits of his pa&s;t life. One of the&s;e, and the fir&s;t which he commemorates, was an at|chievement of chivalry. It was the delivery of a beautiful Swedi&s;h prince&s;s from an impregnable fortre&s;s, in which &s;he was forcibly detained by one of her father's captains. Her father i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, promi&s;ing that whoever would re&s;cue the lady, &s;hould have her in marriage. Regner &s;uc|ceeded in the attempt, and married the fair captive. This was about the year 860 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See Torf. Hi&s;t. Norw. tom. i. lib. 10. Saxo Grammat. p. 152. And Ol. Worm. Lit. Rom. p. 221. edit. 4.

Res. praeclar. ge&s;t. Stockholm. 1737.</NOTE>. There are other &s;trokes in Reg|ner's ode, which, although not belonging to this particular &s;tory, de&s;erve to be pointed out here, as illu&s;trative of our argument. Such as, <Q REND="inline">"It was like being placed near a beau|tiful virgin on a couch.&mdash;It was like ki&s;&s;ing a young widow in the fir&s;t &s;eat at a fea&s;t. I made to &s;truggle in the twilight that golden-haired chief, who pa&s;&s;ed his mornings among the young maidens, and loved to conver&s;e with

Thus many of the heroes in Froi&s;&s;art, in the greate&s;t extremities of danger, recollect their amours, and die think|ing of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. And by the way, in the &s;ame &s;train, Boh, a Dani&s;h champion, having lo&s;t his chin, and one of his cheeks, by a &s;ingle &s;troke from Thur&s;tain Midlang, only re|flected how he &s;hould be received, when thus maimed and disfigured, by the Dani&s;h girls. He in&s;tantly exclaimed in a tone of &s;avage gallantry, <Q REND="inline">"The Dani&s;h virgins will not now willingly or ea&s;ily give me ki&s;&s;es, if I &s;hould perhaps return home <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Norveg. p. 136.</NOTE>."</Q> But there is an ode, in the KNYTLINGA-SAGA, written by Harald the VALIANT, which is profe&s;&s;edly a &s;ong of chivalry; and which; exclu&s;ive of its wild &s;pirit of ad|venture, and its images of &s;avage life, has the romantic air of a &s;et of &s;tanzas, compo&s;ed by a Provencial troubadour. Harald, appears to have been one of the mo&s;t eminent ad|venturers of his age. He had killed the king of Drontheim in a bloody engagement. He had traver&s;ed all the &s;eas, and vi&s;ited all the coa&s;ts, of the north; and had carried his pira|tical enterpri&s;es even as far as the Mediterranean, and the &s;hores of Africa. He was at length taken pri&s;oner, and de|tained for &s;ome time at Con&s;tantinople. He complains in this ode, that the reputation he had acquired by &s;o many hazardous exploits, by his &s;kill in &s;ingle combat, riding, &s;wimming, gliding along the ice, darting, rowing, and guiding a &s;hip through the rocks, had not been able to make any impre&s;&s;ion on Eli&s;&s;iff, or Eli&s;abeth, the beautiful daughter of Jarilas, king of Ru&s;&s;ia <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here, however, chivalry &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but in its rudiments. Under the feudal e&s;tabli&s;hments, which were &s;oon afterwards erected in Europe, it received new vigour, and was inve&s;ted
<PB REF="84">
with the formalities of a regular in&s;titution. The nature and circum&s;tances of that peculiar model of government, were highly favourable to this &s;trange &s;pirit of fanta&s;tic heroi&s;m; which, however unmeaning and ridiculous it may &s;eem, had the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;alutary con&s;equences in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the gene|ral growth of refinement, and the progre&s;&s;ion of civili&s;ation, in forming the manners of Europe, in inculcating the prin|ciples of honour, and in teaching modes of decorum. The genius of the feudal policy was perfectly martial. A nu|merous nobility, formed into &s;eparate principalities, affecting independence, and mutually jealous of their privileges and honours, nece&s;&s;arily lived in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility. This &s;itua|tion rendered per&s;onal &s;trength and courage the mo&s;t requi|&s;ite and e&s;&s;ential accompli&s;hments. And hence, even in time of peace, they had no conception of any diver&s;ions or public ceremonies, but &s;uch as were of the military kind. Yet, as the courts of the&s;e petty princes were thronged with ladies of the mo&s;t eminent di&s;tinction and quality, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion for war was tempered with courte&s;y. The prize of contending champions was adjudged by the ladies; who did not think it incon&s;i&s;tent to be pre&s;ent or to pre&s;ide at the bloody &s;pectacles of the times; and who, them&s;elves, &s;eem to have contracted an unnatural and unbecoming ferocity, while they &s;oftened the manners of tho&s;e valorous knights who fought for their approbation. The high notions of a noble de&s;cent, which aro&s;e from the condition of the feudal con&s;titution, and the ambition of forming an alliance with powerful and opulent families, cheri&s;hed this romantic &s;y&s;tem. It was hard to obtain the fair feudatary, who was the object of univer&s;al adoration. Not only the &s;plendor of birth, but the magnificent ca&s;tle &s;urrounded with embattelled walls, guarded with ma&s;&s;y towers, and crowned with lofty pinnacles, &s;erved to inflame the imagination, and to create an attachment to &s;ome illu&s;trious heire&s;s, who&s;e point of honour it was to be cha&s;te and inacce&s;&s;ible. And the difficulty
<PB REF="85">
of &s;ucce&s;s on the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;eems in great mea&s;ure to have given ri&s;e to that &s;entimental love of romance, which acquie&s;ced in a di&s;tant re&s;pectful admiration, and did not a&s;pire to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The want of an uniform admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the general di&s;order, and &s;tate of univer&s;al anarchy, which naturally &s;prung from the principles of the feudal policy, pre&s;ented perpetual oppor|tunities of checking the oppre&s;&s;ions of arbitrary lords, of delivering captives injuriou&s;ly detained in the baronial ca&s;tles, of puni&s;hing robbers, of &s;uccouring the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and of avenging the impotent and the unarmed, who were every moment expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t licentious in&s;ults and injuries. The violence and inju&s;tice of the times gave birth to valour and humanity. The&s;e acts conferred a lu&s;tre and an im|portance on the character of men profe&s;&s;ing arms, who made force the &s;ub&s;titute of law. In the mean time, the cru&s;ades, &s;o pregnant with enterprize, heightened the habits of this warlike fanatici&s;m. And when the&s;e foreign expedi|tions were ended, in which the hermits and pilgrims of Pale&s;tine had been defended, nothing remained to employ the activity of adventurers but the protection of innocence at home. Chivalry by degrees was con&s;ecrated by religion, who&s;e authority tinctured every pa&s;&s;ion, and was engrafted into every in&s;titution, of the &s;uper&s;titious ages; and at length compo&s;ed that &s;ingular picture of manners, in which the love of a god and of the ladies were reconciled, the &s;aint and the hero were blended, and charity and revenge, zeal and gallantry, devotion and valour, were united.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who think that chivalry &s;tarted late, from the na|ture of the feudal con&s;titution, confound an improved effect with a &s;imple cau&s;e. Not having di&s;tinctly con&s;idered all the particularities belonging to the genius, manners, and u&s;ages of the Gothic tribes, and accu&s;tomed to contemplate nations under the general idea of barbarians, they cannot look for the &s;eeds of elegance among&s;t men, di&s;tingui&s;hed

only for their ignorance and their inhumanity. The rude origin of this heroic gallantry was quickly overwhelmed and extingui&s;hed, by the &s;uperior pomp which it nece&s;&s;arily adopted from the gradual diffu&s;ion of opulence and civility, and that blaze of &s;plendor with which it was &s;urrounded, amid the magnificence of the feudal &s;olemnities.

<P>Amid the gloom of &s;uper&s;tition, in an age of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance and credulity, a ta&s;te for the wonders of oriental fiction was introduced by the Arabians into Europe, many countries of which were already &s;ea&s;oned to a reception of its extravagancies, by means of the poetry of the Gothic &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alds, who perhaps originally derived their ideas from the fame fruitful region of invention.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">DISSERTATION II.</HEAD>
<P>THE irruption of the northern nations into the we&s;tern empire, about the beginning of the fourth century, forms one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and im|portant periods of modern hi&s;tory. Europe, on this great event, &s;uffered the mo&s;t memorable revolutions in its govern|ment and manners; and from the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate of peace and civility, became on a &s;udden, and for the &s;pace of two centuries, the theatre of the mo&s;t deplorable deva&s;tation and di&s;order. But among the di&s;a&s;ters introduced by the&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible barbarians, the mo&s;t calamitous &s;eems to have been the de&s;truction of tho&s;e arts which the Romans &s;till conti|nued &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully to cultivate in their capital, and which they had univer&s;ally communicated to their conquered pro|vinces. Towards the clo&s;e of the fifth century, very few traces of the Roman policy, juri&s;prudence, &s;ciences, and literature,
<PB REF="88">
remained. Some faint &s;parks of knowledge were kept alive in the mona&s;teries; and letters and the liberal arts were happily pre&s;erved from a total extinction during the confu&s;ions of the Gothic invaders, by that &s;lender degree of culture and protection which they received from the prelates of the church, and the religious communities.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the famous academy of Rome<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Theodo&s;ius the younger, in the year 425, founded an academy at Con|&s;tantinople, which he furni&s;hed with able profe&s;&s;ors of every &s;cience, intending it as a rival in&s;titution to that at Rome. Gianon. Hi&s;t. Napl, ii. ch. vi. &s;ect. 1. A noble library had been e&s;tabli&s;hed at Con|&s;tantinople by Con&s;tantius and Valens be|fore the year 380, the cu&s;tody of which was committed to four Greek and three Latin antiquaries or curators. It contained &s;ixty thou&s;and volumes. Zonaras relates, that among other trea&s;ures in this library, there was a roll one hundred feet long, made of a dragon's gutt or inte&s;tine, on which Homer's Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey were written in golden letters. See Bibl. Hi&s;tor. Literar. Select. &amp;c. Ienae, 1754: p. 164. &s;eq. Literature flouri&s;hed in the ea&s;tern empire, while the we&s;tern was depopulated by the Goths; and for many centuries af|terwards. The Turks de&s;troyed one hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and volumes, I &s;up|po&s;e in the imperial library, when they &s;acked Con&s;tantinople in the year 1454. HOD. DE GRAEC.

He adopted into his &s;ervice Boe|thius, the mo&s;t learned and almo&s;t only Latin philo&s;opher of that period. Ca&s;&s;iodorus, another eminent Roman &s;cholar, was Theodoric's grand &s;ecretary: who retiring into a mo|na&s;tery in Calabria, pa&s;&s;ed his old age in collecting books, and practi&s;ing mechanical experiments <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Func. ut &s;upr. xiii. p. 471. xi. p. 595.</NOTE>.

He wrote with little elegance, but he was the fir&s;t that ever dige&s;ted a &s;eries of royal charts or in&s;truments; a monument of &s;ingular utility to the hi&s;torian, and which has &s;erved to throw the

mo&s;t authentic illu&s;tration on the public tran&s;actions and legal con&s;titutions of tho&s;e times. Theodoric's patronage of learning is applauded by Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris. Many other Gothic kings were equally attached to the works of peace; and are not le&s;s con&s;picuous for their ju&s;tice, pru|dence, and temperance, than for their fortitude and magna|nimity. Some of them were diligent in collecting the &s;cat|tered remains of the Roman in&s;titutes, and con&s;tructing a regular code of juri&s;prudence <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gianon. Hi&s;t. Nap. iii. c. 1</NOTE>. It is highly probable, that tho&s;e Goths who became ma&s;ters of Rome, &s;ooner acquired ideas of civility, from the opportunity which that city above all others afforded them of &s;eeing the felicities of poli&s;hed life, of ob&s;erving the conveniencies ari&s;ing from political economy, of mixing with characters re&s;pectable for prudence and learning, and of employing in their coun&s;els men of &s;upe|rior wi&s;dom, who&s;e in&s;truction and advice they found it their intere&s;t to follow. But perhaps the&s;e northern adventurers, at lea&s;t their princes and leaders, were not even at their fir&s;t migrations into the &s;outh, &s;o totally &s;avage and uncivili&s;ed as we are commonly apt to &s;uppo&s;e. Their enemies have been their hi&s;torians, who naturally painted the&s;e violent di&s;turbers of the general repo&s;e in the warme&s;t colours. It is not ea&s;y to conceive, that the &s;ucce&s;s of their amazing en|terprizes was merely the effect of numbers and tumultuary depredation: nor can I be per&s;uaded, that the la&s;ting and flouri&s;hing governments which they e&s;tabli&s;hed in various parts of Europe, could have been framed by brutal force alone, and the blind efforts of unreflecting &s;avages. Superior &s;trength and courage mu&s;t have contributed in a con&s;ider|able degree to their rapid and exten&s;ive conque&s;ts; but at the &s;ame time, &s;uch mighty atchievements could not have been planned and executed without &s;ome extraordinary vigour of mind, uniform principles of conduct, and no common talents of political &s;agacity.</P>

Although the&s;e commotions mu&s;t have been particularly unfavourable to the more elegant literature, yet Latin poetry, from a concurrence of cau&s;es, had for &s;ome time begun to relap&s;e into barbari&s;m. From the growing encrea&s;e of chri&s;tianity, it was deprived of its old fabulous embel|li&s;hments, and chiefly employed in compo&s;ing eccle&s;ia&s;tical hymns. Amid the&s;e impediments however, and the nece&s;&s;ary degeneration of ta&s;te and &s;tyle, a few poets &s;upported the character of the Roman mu&s;e with tolerable dignity, during the decline of the Roman empire. The&s;e were Au&s;onius, Paulinus, Sidonius, Sedulius, Arator, Juvencus, Pro&s;per, and Fortunatus. With the la&s;t, who flouri&s;hed at the be|ginning of the &s;ixth century, and was bi&s;hop of Poitiers, the Roman poetry is &s;uppo&s;ed to have expired.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth century Europe began to recover &s;ome degree of tranquillity. Many barbarous countries during this pe|riod, particularly the inhabitants of Germany, of Frie&s;land, and other northern nations, were converted to the chri&s;tian faith <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cave. Saecul. Monoth. p. 440.</NOTE>. The religious controver&s;ies which at this time di|vided the Greek and Latin churches, rou&s;ed the minds of men to literary enquiries. The&s;e di&s;putes in &s;ome mea&s;ure called forth abilities which otherwi&s;e would have been un|known and unemployed; and, together with the &s;ubtleties of argumentation, in&s;en&s;ibly taught the graces of &s;tyle, and the habits of compo&s;ition. Many of the popes were per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, and promoted u&s;eful knowledge no le&s;s by example than authority. Political union was by degrees e&s;tabli&s;hed; and regular &s;y&s;tems of government, which alone can en&s;ure per&s;onal &s;ecurity, aro&s;e in the various provinces of Europe occupied by the Gothic tribes. The Saxons had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Britain, the Franks be|came ma&s;ters of Gaul, the Huns of Pannonia, the Goths of
<PB REF="91">
Spain, and the Lombards of Italy. Hence lei&s;ure and re|po&s;e diffu&s;ed a mildne&s;s of manners, and introduced the arts of peace; and, awakening the human mind to a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its powers, directed its faculties to their proper objects.</P>
<P>In the mean time, no &s;mall ob&s;truction to the propagation or rather revival of letters, was the paucity of valuable books. The libraries, particularly tho&s;e of Italy, which abounded in numerous and ine&s;timable trea&s;ures of literature, were every where de&s;troyed by the precipitate rage and undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing violence of the northern armies. Towards the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh century, even in the papal library at Rome, the number of books was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that pope Saint Martin reque&s;ted Sanctamand bi&s;hop of Mae&s;tricht, if po&s;&s;ible to &s;upply this defect from the remote&s;t parts of Ger|many <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Concil.

See Poggii Op. p. 309. Am&s;t. 1720. 8vo. The very copy of Quintilian, found by Poggius, is &s;aid to have been in lord Sunderland's noble library now at Blenheim.

<P>After the calamities which the &s;tate of literature &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence of the incur&s;ions of the northern nations, the fir&s;t re&s;torers of the antient philo&s;ophical &s;ciences in Europe, the &s;tudy of which, by opening the faculties and extending the views of mankind, gradually led the way to other parts of learning, were the Arabians. In the beginning of the eighth century, this wonderful people, equally fa|mous for their conque&s;ts and their love of letters, in ravaging the A&s;iatic provinces, found many Greek books, which they read with infinite avidity: and &s;uch was the gratification they received from this fortunate acqui&s;ition, and &s;o power|fully their curio&s;ity was excited to make further di&s;coveries in this new field of knowledge, that they reque&s;ted their ca|liphs to procure from the emperor at Con&s;tantinople the be&s;t Greek writers. The&s;e they carefully tran&s;lated into Arabic <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See Abulfarag. per Pocock, Dyna&s;t. p. 160. Greek was a familiar language to the Arabians. The accompts of the caliph's trea&s;ury were always written in Greek till the year of Chri&s;t 715. They were then ordered to be drawn in Arabic. Many proofs of this might be mentioned. Greek was a familiar language in Mahomet's hou&s;hold. Zaid, one of Mahomet's &s;ecre|taries, to whom he dictated the Koran, was a perfect ma&s;ter of Greek. Sale's Prelim. Di&s;c. p. 144, 145.

Or perhaps it was too cold and too correct for their extravagant and romantic conceptions <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Yet it appears from many of their fic|tions, that &s;ome of the Greek poets were not unfamiliar among them, perhaps long before the period a&s;&s;igned in the text.

<P>A curious circum&s;tance of the envy with which the Greeks at Con&s;tantinople treated this growing philo&s;ophy of the Arabians, is mentioned by Cedrenus. Al-Manun hearing of one Leo, an excellent inathe|matician at Con&s;tantinople, wrote to the emperor, reque&s;ting that Leo might be permitted to &s;ettle in his dominions, with a mo&s;t ample &s;alary, as a teacher in that &s;cience. The emperor by this means being made acquainted with Leo's merit, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a &s;chool, in which he appointed Leo a profe&s;&s;or, for the &s;ake of a &s;pecious ex|cu&s;e. The caliph &s;ent a &s;econd time to the emperor, entreating that Leo might re&s;ide with him for a &s;hort time only; of|fering likewi&s;e a large &s;um of money, and terms of la&s;ting peace and alliance.

In the mean time, finding by the Introduction that the whole con&s;i&s;ted of eight books, and that the eighth book was the foundation of the re&s;t, and being in|formed that there was a complete copy in the emperor's library at Con&s;tantinople, he applied to him for a tran&s;cript.

The Latin language was familiar to the Gauls when they were conquered by the Franks; for they were a province of the Roman empire till the year 485. It was the language of their religious offices, their laws, and public tran&s;actions. The Franks who conquered the Gauls at the period ju&s;t mentioned, &s;till continued this u&s;age, imagining there was a &s;uperior dignity in the language of imperial Rome: although this incorporation of the Franks with the Gauls greatly corrupted the latinity of the latter, and had given it a &s;trong tincture of barbarity before the reign of Charlemagne.

It is certain that literature was at its height among our Saxon ance&s;tors about the eighth century. The&s;e happy be|ginnings were almo&s;t entirely owing to the attention of king Alfred, who encouraged learning by his own example, by founding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eminaries of in&s;truction, and by rewarding the labours of &s;cholars. But the efforts of this pious monarch were &s;oon bla&s;ted by the &s;upinene&s;s of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the incur&s;ions of the Danes, and the di&s;traction of national af|fairs.

the mo&s;t advantageous con&s;equences, and triumphantly clo&s;es his narrative with this plea&s;ing pre&s;entiment. The Picts, at this period, were at peace with the Saxons or Engli&s;h, and converted to chri&s;tianity. The Scots lived contented within their own boundary. The Britons or Wel&s;h, from a natural enmity, and a di&s;like to the catholic in&s;titution of keeping Ea&s;ter, &s;ometimes attempted to di&s;turb the national repo&s;e; but they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ervient to the Saxons.

<P>But a long night of confu&s;ion and gro&s;s ignorance &s;uc|ceeded. The principal productions of the mo&s;t eminent mona&s;teries for three centuries, were incredible legends which di&s;covered no marks of invention, unedifying homilies, and trite expo&s;itions of the &s;criptures.

<P>England at length, in the beginning of the eleventh cen|tury, received from the Normans the rudiments of that cultivation which it has pre&s;erved to the pre&s;ent times.

<P>The conqueror him&s;elf patroni&s;ed and loved letters.

His turn for poetry did not hinder his arriving to the dignity of an archdeacon. Leland mentions eight books of his epi|grams, amatorial ver&s;es <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Wharton, Angl. Sacr. ii. 29.</NOTE>, and poems on philo&s;ophical &s;ub|jects <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lel. Script. Brit. p. 197.</NOTE>. The proem to his book DE HERBIS, has this elegant invocation.</P>

The temporary gleam of light did not arrive to perfect day. The minds of &s;cholars were diverted from the&s;e liberal &s;tudies in the rapidity of their career; and the arts of compo&s;ition, and the ornaments of language were neglected, to make way for the barbarous and barren &s;ubtleties of &s;chola&s;tic divinity.

Nor was the profe&s;&s;ion of the civil and canonical laws a &s;mall impediment to the propagation of tho&s;e letters which humani&s;e the mind, and cultivate the manners. I do not mean to deny, that the accidental di&s;covery of the imperial code in the twelfth century, contributed in a con&s;iderable degree to civili&s;e Europe, by introducing, among other be|neficial con&s;equences, more legitimate ideas concerning the nature of government and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by creating a nece&s;&s;ity of transferring judicial decrees from an illiterate nobility to the cogni&s;ance of &s;cholars, by le&s;&s;ening the attachment to the military profe&s;&s;ion, and by giving ho|nour and importance to civil employments: but to &s;ugge&s;t, that the mode in which this invaluable &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;pru|dence was &s;tudied, proved injurious to polite literature. It was no &s;ooner revived, than it was received as a &s;chola&s;tic &s;cience, and taught by regular profe&s;&s;ors, in mo&s;t of the univer&s;ities of Europe. To be &s;killed in the theology of the &s;chools was the chief and general ambition of &s;cholars: but at the &s;ame time a knowledge of both the laws was become an indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite, at lea&s;t an e&s;&s;ential re|commendation, for obtaining the mo&s;t opulent eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities. Hence it was cultivated with univer&s;al avidity.

And it is ea&s;y to conceive the pedantry with which it was pur&s;ued in the&s;e &s;eminaries during the middle ages. It was treated with the &s;ame &s;pirit of idle &s;peculation which had been carried into philo&s;ophy and theology, it was over|whelmed with endle&s;s commentaries which di&s;claimed all elegance of language, and &s;erved only to exerci&s;e genius, as it afforded materials for framing the flim&s;y labyrinths of ca&s;ui&s;try.</P>

<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e three dialects, with which the&s;e Annals of Engli&s;h Poetry commence, formed a language extremely bar|barous, irregular, and intractable; and con&s;equently pro|mi&s;es no very &s;triking &s;pecimens in any &s;pecies of compo&s;i|tion. Its &s;ub&s;tance was the Dani&s;h Saxon, adulterated with French. The Saxon indeed, a language &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on uni|form principles, and poli&s;hed by poets and theologi&s;ts, how|ever corrupted by the Danes, had much per&s;picuity, &s;trength, and harmony: but the French imported by the Conqueror and his people, was a confu&s;ed jargon of Teutonic, Gauli&s;h, and vitiated Latin. In this fluctuating &s;tate of our national &s;peech, the French predominated. Even before the conque&s;t the Saxon language began to fall into contempt, and the French, or Franki&s;h, to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead: a circum|&s;tance, which at once facilitated and foretold the Norman acce&s;&s;ion.

Hence, long after the reign of Edward the third, many of our lawyers compo&s;ed their tracts in French. And reports and &s;ome &s;tatutes were made in that language. See Forte&s;cut. de Laud. Leg. Angl. cap. xlviii.</NOTE>: although the &s;ame &s;tatute decrees,

It aboli&s;hed a token of &s;ubjection and di&s;grace: and in &s;ome degree, contributed to prevent further French innovations in the language then u&s;ed, which yet remained in a compound &s;tate, and retained a con&s;iderable mixture of foreign phra&s;eo|logy. In the mean time, it mu&s;t be remembered, that this corruption of the Saxon was not only owing to the admi&s;|&s;ion of new words, occa&s;ioned by the new alliance, but to changes of its own forms and terminations, ari&s;ing from rea&s;ons which we cannot inve&s;tigate or explain <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject will be further illu&s;trated in the next &s;ection.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the manu&s;cripts of Digby in the Bodleian library at Oxford, we find a religious or moral Ode, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and ninety-one &s;tanzas, which the learned Hickes places ju&s;t after the conque&s;t <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ling.

In deference however to &s;o great an authority, I am obliged to mention it here; and e&s;pecially as it exhibits a regular lyric &s;trophe of four lines, the &s;econd and fourth of which rhyme together. Although the&s;e four lines may be perhaps re&s;olved into two Alexandrines; a mea&s;ure concern|ing which more will be &s;aid hereafter, and of which it will be &s;ufficient to remark at pre&s;ent, that it appears to have been u&s;ed very early. For I cannot recollect any &s;trophes of this &s;ort in the elder Runic or Saxon poetry; nor in any of the old Franki&s;h poems, particularly of Otfrid, a monk of Wei&s;&s;enburgh, who turned the evangelical hi&s;tory into Franki&s;h ver&s;e about the ninth century, and has left &s;everal

<P>In the library of Je&s;us college at Oxford, I have &s;een a Norman-Saxon poem of another ca&s;t, yet without much invention or poetry <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">It is al&s;o in Bibl. Cotton. MSS. CALIG. ix. A. 5. fol. 230.</NOTE>. It is a conte&s;t between an owl and a nightingale, about &s;uperiority in voice and &s;inging; the deci&s;ion of which is left to the judgment of one John de Guldevord <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">So it is &s;aid in Catal. MSS. Angl. p. 69. But by mi&s;take. Our John de Guldevorde is indeed the author of the poem which immediately precedes in the manu&s;cript, as appears by the following entry at the end of it, in the hand-writing of the very Iearned Edward Lwyhd. <Q>"On part of a broken leaf of this MS.

It &s;eems to be of equal antiquity with that mentioned in the text.

<P>This mode of writing is not uncommon in antient manu|&s;cripts of French poetry. And &s;ome critics may be inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that the ver&s;es which we call Alexandrine, acci|dentally a&s;&s;umed their form merely from the practice of ab|&s;urd tran&s;cribers, who frugally cho&s;e to fill their pages to the extremity, and violated the metrical &s;tructure for the &s;ake
<PB N="36" REF="201">
of &s;aving their vellum. It is certain, that the common &s;tanza of four &s;hort lines may be reduced into two Alexandrines, and on the contrary. I have before ob&s;erved, that the Saxon poem cited by Hickes, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and ninety one &s;tanzas, is written in &s;tanzas in the Bodleian, and in Alexandrines in the Trinity manu&s;cript at Cambridge. How it came originally from the poet I will not pretend to de|termine.</P>
<P>Our early poetry often appears in &s;atirical pieces on the e&s;tabli&s;hed and eminent profe&s;&s;ions. And the writers, as we have already &s;een, &s;ucceeded not ami&s;s when they cloathed their &s;atire in allegory. But nothing can be conceived more &s;currilous and illiberal than their &s;atires when they de&s;cend to mere invective. In the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, among other ex|amples which I could mention, we have a &s;atirical ballad on the lawyers <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">MSS. ut &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. f. 70. b.</NOTE>, and another on the clergy, or rather &s;ome par|ticular bi&s;hop. The latter begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Hyrd-men hatieth ant vch mones hyne,</L>
<L>For ever uch a paros&s;he heo polketh in pyne</L>

<P>The elder French poetry abounds in allegorical &s;atire: and I doubt not that the author of the &s;atire on the mona&s;tic profe&s;&s;ion, cited above, copied &s;ome French &s;atire on the &s;ubject. Satire was one &s;pecies of the poetry of the Proven|cial troubadours. An&s;elm Fayditt a troubadour of the ele|venth century, who will again be mentioned, wrote a &s;ort of &s;atirical drama called the HERESY of the FATHERS, HERE|GIA DEL PREYRES, a ridicule on the council which con|demned the Albigen&s;es. The papal legates often fell under

<P>The poet ingeniou&s;ly feigns, that his new mona&s;tic order con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t eminent nobility and gentry of both &s;exes, who inhabit the mona&s;teries a&s;&s;igned to it promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly; and that no per&s;on is excluded from this e&s;tabli&s;h|ment who can &s;upport the rank of a gentleman. They are bound by their &s;tatutes to live in perpetual idlene&s;s and lux|ury: and the &s;atyri&s;t refers them for a pattern or rule of prac|tice in the&s;e important articles, to the mona&s;teries of Sem|pringham in Lincoln&s;hire, Beverley in York&s;hire, the Knights Ho&s;pitalers, and many other religious orders then flouri&s;h|ing in England <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">MSS. ibid. f. 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the feudal manners, and the magnifi|cence of our Norman ance&s;tors, their love of military glory, the enthu&s;ia&s;m with which they engaged in the cru&s;ades, and the wonders to which they mu&s;t have been familiari&s;ed from tho&s;e ea&s;tern enterpri&s;es, we naturally &s;uppo&s;e, what will hereafter be more particularly proved, that their retinues
<PB N="38" REF="203">
abounded with min&s;trels and harpers, and that their chief entertainment was to li&s;ten to the recital of romantic and martial adventures. But I have been much di&s;appointed in my &s;earches after the metrical tales which mu&s;t have pre|vailed in their times. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e old heroic &s;ongs are peri&s;hed, together with the &s;tately ca&s;tles in who&s;e halls they were &s;ung. Yet they are not &s;o totally lo&s;t as we may be apt to imagine. Many of them &s;till partly exi&s;t in the old Engli&s;h metrical romances, which will be mentioned in their proper places; yet dive&s;ted of their original form, poli&s;hed in their &s;tyle, adorned with new incidents, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively mo|derni&s;ed by repeated tran&s;cription and recitation, and retain|ing little more than the outlines of the original compo&s;ition. This has not been the ca&s;e of the legendary and other reli|gious poems written &s;oon after the conque&s;t, manu&s;cripts of which abound in our libraries. From the nature of their &s;ubject they were le&s;s popular and common; and being le&s;s frequently recited, became le&s;s liable to perpetual innovation or alteration.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t antient Engli&s;h metrical romance which I can di&s;cover, is entitled the GESTE OF KING HORN. It was evi|dently written after the cru&s;ades had begun, is mentioned by Chaucer <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rim. Thop. 3402. Urr.</NOTE>, and probably &s;till remains in its original &s;tate. I will fir&s;t give the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory, and afterwards add &s;ome &s;pecimens of the compo&s;ition. But I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that this &s;tory occurs in very old French metre in the manu|&s;cripts of the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 527. b. f. 59. Cod. membr.</NOTE>, &s;o that probably it is a tran&s;lation: a circum&s;tance which will throw light on an argument pur&s;ued hereafter, proving that mo&s;t of our me|trical romances are tran&s;lated from the French.</P>
<P>Mury, king of the Saracens, lands in the kingdom of Sud|dene, where he kills the king named Allof. The queen, Godylt, e&s;capes; but Mury &s;eizes on her &s;on Horne, a beautiful

Here the prince&s;s Rymenild falls in love with him, declares her pa&s;&s;ion, and is betrothed. Horne, in con&s;equence of this engagement, leaves the prince&s;s for &s;even years; to demon&s;trate, according to the ritual of chivalry, that by &s;eeking and accompli&s;hing dan|gerous enterpri&s;es he de&s;erved her affection. He proves a mo&s;t valorous and invincible knight: and at the end of &s;even years, having killed king Mury, recovered his father's king|dom, and atchieved many &s;ignal exploits, recovers the prin|ce&s;s Rymenild from the hands of his treacherous knight and companion Fykenyld; carries her in triumph to his own country, and there reigns with her in great &s;plendor and pro&s;perity.

<P>It is the force of the &s;tory in the&s;e pieces that chiefly en|gages our attention. The min&s;trels had no idea of conduct|ing and de&s;cribing a delicate &s;ituation.

In the mean time, the pictures of antient manners pre&s;ented by the&s;e early writers, &s;trongly intere&s;t the ima|gination: e&s;pecially as having the &s;ame uncommon merit with the pictures of manners in Homer, that of being founded in truth and reality, and actually painted from the life. To talk of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and ab&s;urdity of &s;uch manners is little to the purpo&s;e; the poet is only concerned in the ju&s;tne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of the repre&s;entation.</P>

Even to this day, the ma&s;|&s;acre of Hengi&s;t, as I have partly hinted, is an undi&s;puted piece of hi&s;tory. Why &s;hould not the other part of the &s;tory be equally true? Be&s;ides the &s;ilence of Nennius, I am aware, that this hypothe&s;is is &s;till at|tended with many difficulties and impro|babilities. And &s;o are all the &s;y&s;tems and conjectures ever yet framed about this amazing monument. It appears to me, to be the work of a rude people who had &s;ome ideas of art: &s;uch as we may &s;uppo&s;e the Romans left behind them among the Bri|tons. In the mean time I do not remem|ber, that in the very controverted etymolo|gy of the word <HI>Stone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">enge</HI> the name of HEN|GIST has been properly or &s;ufficiently con|&s;idered.</NOTE>.</L></Q>

It appears from this and previous in&s;tances, that political bal|lads, I mean &s;uch as were the vehicles of political &s;atire, prevailed much among our early ance&s;tors. About the pre|&s;ent era, we meet with a ballad complaining of the exhor|bitant fees extorted, and the numerous taxes levied, by the king's officers <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 64. There is a &s;ong half Latin and half French, much on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Ibid. f. 137. b.</NOTE>.

The author names &s;ome of the ju&s;tices or commi&s;|&s;ioners, now not ea&s;ily di&s;coverable: and &s;ays, that he &s;erved the king both in peace and war in Flanders, Ga&s;cony, and Scotland <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MSS.

<P>At the clo&s;e of the reign of Edward the fir&s;t, and in the year 1303, a poet occurs named Robert Mannyng, but more commonly called Robert de Brunne.

As he intended his chronicle to be &s;ung, at lea&s;t by parts, at public fe&s;tivals, he found it expedient to apologi&s;e for the&s;e deficiencies in the prologue; as he had partly done before in his prologue to the MANUAL OF SINS.</P>

It was undoubtedly a great impediment to the cultivation and progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the Engli&s;h language at the&s;e early periods, that the be&s;t authors cho&s;e to write in French. Many of Robert Gro&s;thead's pieces are indeed in Latin; yet where the &s;ubject was popular, and not imme|diately addre&s;&s;ed to learned readers, he adopted the Romance or French language, in preference to his native Engli&s;h. Of this, as we have already &s;een, his MANUEL PECHE, and his CHATEAU D' AMOUR, are &s;ufficient proofs, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e: and his example and authority mu&s;t have had con&s;i|derable influence in encouraging this practice. Peter Lang|toft, our Augu&s;tine canon of Bridlington, not only compiled the large chronicle of England, above recited, in French; but even tran&s;lated Herbert Bo&s;cam's Latin Life of Thomas of Beckett into French rhymes <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pit&s;. p. 890.

<P>In the &s;ame manu&s;cript I find a French poem probably written by an Engli&s;hman, and in the year 1300, containing the adven|tures of Gilote and Johanne, two ladies of gallantry, in various parts of England and Ireland; particularly at Winche&s;ter and Pontefract. f. 66. b. The curious reader is al&s;o referred to a French poem, in which the poet &s;uppo&s;es that a min&s;trel, <HI>jugleour,</HI> travelling from London, cloathed in a rich tabard, met the king and his retinue. The king a&s;ks him many que&s;tions; particularly his lord's name, and the price of his hor&s;e. The min&s;trel evades all the king's que&s;tions by impertinent an&s;wers; and at la&s;t pre|&s;umes to give his maje&s;ty advice. Ibid. f. 107. b.</P></NOTE>. Yet this fa&s;hion proceeded rather from nece&s;&s;ity and a principle of convenience, than from affectation. The vernacular Engli&s;h, as I have before remarked, was rough and unpoli&s;hed: and al|though the&s;e writers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but few ideas of ta&s;te and ele|gance, they embraced a foreign tongue, almo&s;t equally familiar, and in which they could convey their &s;entiments with greater ea&s;e, grace, and propriety. It &s;hould al&s;o be con&s;idered, that our mo&s;t eminent &s;cholars received a part of their education at the univer&s;ity of Paris. Another, and a very material circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m|&s;tance, concurred to countenance this fa&s;hionable practice of compo&s;ing in French. It procured them readers of rank and di&s;tinction. The Engli&s;h court, for more than two hundred years after the conque&s;t, was totally French: and our kings, either from birth, kindred, or marriage, and from a perpe|tual intercour&s;e, &s;eem to have been more clo&s;ely connected with France than with England. It was however fortunate that the&s;e French pieces were written, as &s;ome of them met
<PB N="87" REF="252">
with their tran&s;lators: who perhaps unable to a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of original writers, at lea&s;t by this means contributed to adorn their native tongue: and who very probably would not have written at all, had not original writers, I mean their cotemporaries who wrote in French, furni&s;hed them with models and materials.</P>
<P>Hearne, to who&s;e diligence even the poetical antiquarian is much obliged, but who&s;e conjectures are generally wrong, imagines, that the old Engli&s;h metrical romance, called RY|CHARDE CUER DE LYON, was written by Robert de Brunne. It is at lea&s;t probable, that the lei&s;ure of mona&s;tic life pro|duced many rhymers. From proofs here given we may fairly conclude, that the monks often wrote for the min&s;trels: and although our Gilbertine brother of Brunne cho&s;e to relate true &s;tories in plain language, yet it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that many of our antient tales in ver&s;e containing fictitious adventures, were written, although not invented, in the reli|gious hou&s;es.

<P>That the pope &s;hould here pronounce the funeral pane|gyric of Edward the fir&s;t, is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing, if we con&s;ider the predominant ideas of the age. And in the true &s;pirit of the&s;e ideas, the poet makes this illu&s;trious monarch's atchievements in the holy land, his principal and leading topic. But there is a particular circum&s;tance alluded to in
<PB N="108" REF="273">
the&s;e &s;tanzas, relating to the cru&s;ading character of Edward, together with its con&s;equences, which needs explanation. Edward, in the decline of life, had vowed a &s;econd expedi|tion to Jeru&s;alem: but finding his end approach, in his la&s;t moments he devoted the prodigious &s;um of thirty thou&s;and pounds to provide one hundred and forty knights <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">The poet &s;ays eighty.</NOTE>, who &s;hould carry his heart into Pale&s;tine. But this appointment of the dying king was never executed. Our elegi&s;t, and the chroniclers, impute the crime of witholding &s;o pious a legacy to the advice of the king of France, who&s;e daughter I&s;abel was married to the &s;ucceeding king. But it is more probable to &s;uppo&s;e, that Edward the &s;econd, and his profligate mi|nion Piers Gave&s;ton, di&s;&s;ipated the money in their luxurious and expen&s;ive plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>WE have &s;een, in the preceding &s;ection, that the cha|racter of our poetical compo&s;ition began to be changed about the reign of the fir&s;t Edward: that either fictitious adventures were &s;ub&s;tituted by the min&s;trels in the place of hi&s;torical and traditionary facts, or reality di&s;gui&s;ed by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of invention; and that a ta&s;te for ornamental and even exotic expre&s;&s;ion gradually prevailed over the rude &s;implicity of the native Engli&s;h phra&s;eology. This change, which with our language affected our poetry, had been growing for &s;ome time; and among other cau&s;es was occa&s;ioned by the introduction and increa&s;e of the tales of chivalry.</P>
<P>The ideas of chivalry, in an imperfect degree, had been of old e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Gothic tribes. The fa&s;hion of challenging to &s;ingle combat, the pride of &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">king dangerous adventures, and the &s;pirit of avenging and protecting the fair &s;ex, &s;eem to have been peculiar to the northern nations in the mo&s;t uncultivated &s;tate of Europe. All the&s;e cu&s;toms were afterwards encouraged and confirmed by corre&s;ponding circum&s;tances in the feudal con&s;titution. At length the cru&s;ades excited a new &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, and introduced into the courts and ceremonies of European princes a higher degree of &s;plendor and parade, caught from the riches and magnificence of ea&s;tern cities <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I cannot help tran&s;cribing here a cu|rious pa&s;&s;age from old Fauchett.

e&s;tabli&s;hed a ta&s;te for hyperbolical de&s;cription, and propagated an infinity of marvellous tales, which men returning from di&s;tant countries ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on credulous and ignorant minds. The unparalleled emulation with which the nations of chri&s;tendom univer&s;ally embraced this holy cau&s;e, the pride with which emperors, kings, barons, earls, bi&s;hops, and knights &s;trove to excel each other on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, not only in prowe&s;s and heroi&s;m, but in &s;umptuous equipages, gorgeous banners, armorial cogni&s;ances, &s;plendid pavilions, and other expen&s;ive articles of a &s;imilar nature, diffu&s;ed a love of war, and a fondne&s;s for military pomp. Hence their very diver&s;ions became warlike, and the martial enthu&s;ia&s;m of the times appeared in tilts and tournaments. The&s;e practices and opinions co-operated with the kindred &s;uper&s;titions of dragons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Kircher's Mund. Subterran. viii. &sect; 4. He mentions a knight of Rhodes made grand ma&s;ter of the order for killing a dra|gon, 1345.</NOTE>, dwarfs, fairies, giants, and en|chanters, which the traditions of the Gothic &s;calders had already planted; and produced that extraordinary &s;pecies of compo&s;ition which has been called ROMANCE.</P>
<P>Before the&s;e expeditions into the ea&s;t became fa&s;hionable, the principal and leading &s;ubjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king Arthur with his knights of the round table, and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers. But in the romances written after the holy war, a new &s;et of champions, of conque&s;ts and of countries, were intro|duced. Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles, and Godfrey of Bulloigne, Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the &s;oul|dans, and the cities of Aegypt and Syria, became the favou|rite topics. The troubadours of Provence, an idle and un|&s;ettled race of men, took up arms, and followed their barons

in prodigious multitudes to the conque&s;t of Jeru&s;alem. They made a con&s;iderable part of the hou&s;hold of the nobility of France. Louis the &s;eventh, king of France, not only en|tertained them at his court very liberally, but commanded a con&s;iderable company of them into his retinue, when he took &s;hip for Pale&s;tine, that they might &s;olace him with their &s;ongs during the dangers and inconveniencies of &s;o long a voyage <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Velley, Hi&s;t.

What a glory! The wor|&s;hipfull company of Merchant-taylors in London, if I recollect right, boa&s;t the names of many dukes, earls, and princes, enrolled in their community.

Here a new and more copious &s;ource of fabling was opened: in the&s;e expeditions they picked up numberle&s;s extravagant &s;tories, and at their return enriched romance with an infinite variety of oriental &s;cenes and fictions. Thus the&s;e later wonders, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upplanted the former: they had the recommendation of novelty, and gained &s;till more attention, as they came from a greater di&s;tance <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The old French hi&s;torian Mezeray goes &s;o far as to derive the origin of the French poetry and romances from the cru|&s;ades.

<P>In the mean time we &s;hould recollect, that the Saracens or Arabians, the &s;ame people which were the object of the cru&s;ades, had acquired an e&s;tabli&s;hm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt in Spain about the ninth century: and that by means of this earlier intercour&s;e, many of their fictions and fables, together with their lite|rature, mu&s;t have been known in Europe before the chri&s;|tian armies invaded A&s;ia.

There is a curious &s;tory recorded by the French chroniclers, concerning Richard's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">kill in the min&s;trel art, which I will here relate.&mdash;Richard, in his return from the cru&s;ade, was taken pri&s;oner about the year 1193. A whole year elap&s;ed before the Engli&s;h knew where their monarch was im|pri&s;oned. Blondell de Ne&s;le, Richard's favourite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in&s;trel, re&s;olved to find out his lord; and after travelling many days with|out &s;ucce&s;s, at la&s;t came to a ca&s;tle where Richard was detained in cu&s;tody. Here he found that the ca&s;tle belonged to the duke of Au&s;tria, and that a king was there im|pri&s;oned. Su&s;pecting that the pri&s;oner was his ma&s;ter, he found means to place him|&s;elf directly before a window of the cham|ber where the king was kept; and in this &s;ituation began to &s;ing a French chan&s;on, which Richard and Blondell had formerly written together.

<P>But not only the pieces of the French min&s;trels, written in French, were circulated in England about this time; but tran&s;lations of the&s;e pieces were made into Engli&s;h, which containing much of the French idiom, together with a &s;ort of poetical phra&s;eology before unknown, produced various innovations in our &s;tyle. The&s;e tran&s;lations, it is probable, were enlarged with additions, or improved with alterations of the &s;tory. Hence it was that Robert de Brunne, as we have already &s;een, complained of <HI>&s;trange</HI> and <HI>quaint</HI> Engli&s;h, of the changes made in the &s;tory of SIR TRISTRAM, and of the liberties a&s;&s;umed by his cotemporary min&s;trels in altering facts and coining new phra&s;es. Yet the&s;e circum&s;tances en|riched our tongue, and extended the circle of our poetry. And for what rea&s;on the&s;e fables were &s;o much admired and encouraged, in preference to the languid poetical chro|nicles of Robert of Glouce&s;ter and Robert of Brunne, it is obvious to conjecture. The gallantries of chivalry were ex|hibited with new &s;plendour, and the times were growing more refined. The Norman fa&s;hions were adopted even in Wales. In the year 1176, a &s;plendid carou&s;al, after the manner of the Normans, was given by a Wel&s;h prince. This was Rhees ap Gryffyth king of South Wales, who at Chri&s;tmas made a great fea&s;t in the ca&s;tle of Cardigan, then

Here, among others, &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital and favou|rite &s;tories of romance are mentioned, Arthur, Charlemagne, the Siege of Troy with its appendages, and Alexander the Great: and there are four authors of high e&s;teem in the dark ages, Geoffry of Monmouth, Turpin, Guido of Co|lonna, and Calli&s;thenes, who&s;e books were the grand repo|&s;itories of the&s;e &s;ubjects, and contained mo&s;t of the tradi|tionary fictions, whether of Arabian or cla&s;&s;ical origin, which con&s;tantly &s;upplied materials to the writers of ro|mance.

<P>As to the Siege of Troy, it appears that both Homer's poems were unknown, at lea&s;t not under&s;tood in Europe, from the abolition of literature by the Goths in the fourth cen|tury, to the fourteenth. Geoffry of Monmouth indeed, who wrote about the year 1160, a man of learning for that age, produces Homer in atte&s;tation of a fact a&s;&s;erted in his hi&s;|tory: but in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hews that he knew little more than Homer's name, and was but imperfectly ac|quainted with Homer's &s;ubject.

D. 1070, finding that the Britons and Francs drew their de&s;cent from Troy, was am|bitious of a&s;&s;igning the &s;ame boa&s;ted origin to Odin. But this tradition appears to have been older than the Edda. And it is more probable, that the Britons and Francs borrowed it from the Scandinavian Goths, and adapted it to them&s;elves; un|le&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e nations, I mean the former, were branches of the Gothic &s;tem, which gave them a &s;ort of inhe|rent right to the claim. This rea&s;oning may perhaps account for the early exi&s;tence and extraordinary popularity of the Trojan &s;tory among nations ignorant and illiterate, who could only have received it by tradi|tion. Geoffry of Monmouth took this de|&s;cent of the Britons from Troy, from the Wel&s;h or Armoric bards, and they perhaps had it in common with the Scandinavian &s;calders. There is not a &s;yllable of it in the authentic hi&s;torians of England, who wrote before him; particularly tho&s;e antient ones, Bede, Gildas, and the uninterpolated Nennius. Henry of Huntingdon began his hi&s;tory from <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> and it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s only on further information that he added <HI>Brute.</HI> But this information was from a manu&s;cript found by him in his way to Rome in the abbey of Bec in Normandy, probably Geoffry's original. <HI>H.

<P>This fable of the de&s;cent of the Britons from the Trojans was &s;olemnly alledged as an authentic and undeniable proof in a controver&s;y of great national importance, by Edward the fir&s;t and his nobility, with|out the lea&s;t objection from the oppo&s;ite party.

<P>Oddegir the Dane makes a part of Charlemagne's hi&s;|tory; and, I believe, is mentioned by archbi&s;hop Turpin.

To this &s;ubject, although almo&s;t equally belonging to that of Charlemagne, we may al&s;o refer a French romance in ver&s;e, written by Philipes Mou&s;ques, canon and chancellor of the church of Tournay. It is in fact, a chronicle of France: but the author, who does not chu&s;e to begin quite &s;o high as Adam and Eve, nor yet later than the Trojan war, opens his hi&s;tory with the rape of Helen, pa&s;&s;es on to an ample de&s;cription of the &s;iege of Troy; and, through an exact detail of all the great events which &s;ucceeded, conducts his reader to the year 1240. This work comprehends all the fictions of Turpin's Char|lemagne, with a variety of other extravagant &s;tories di&s;per&s;ed in many profe&s;&s;ed romances. But it pre&s;erves numberle&s;s cu|rious particulars, which throw con&s;iderable light on hi&s;to|rical facts. Du Cange has collected from it all that concerns the French emperors of Con&s;tantinople, which he has printed at the end of his entertaining hi&s;tory of that city.</P>
<P>It was indeed the fa&s;hion for the hi&s;torians of the&s;e times, to form &s;uch a general plan as would admit all the ab&s;ur|dities of popular tradition. Connection of parts, and uni|formity of &s;ubject, were as little &s;tudied as truth. Ages of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition are more affected by the marvel|lous than by plain facts; and believe what they find written, without di&s;cernment or examination. No man before the &s;ixteenth century pre&s;umed to doubt that the Francs derived their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">igin from Francus, a &s;on of Hector; that the Spa|niards were de&s;cended from Japhet, the Britons from Brutus, and the Scotch from Fergus. Vincent de Beauvais, who lived under Louis the ninth of France, and who, on account of his extraordinary erudition, was appointed preceptor to that king's &s;ons, very gravely cla&s;&s;es archbi&s;hop Turpin's Char|lemagne among the real hi&s;tories, and places it on a level with Suetonius and Ce&s;ar.

<P>The romance of SIDRAC, often entitled, <HI>Le Livere Sydrac le philo&s;ophe le quel hom appele le livere de le funtane de totes Sciences,</HI> appears to have been very popular, from the pre&s;ent frequency of its manu&s;cripts. But it is rather a romance of Arabian philo&s;ophy than of chivalry. It is a &s;y&s;tem of natural knowledge, and particularly treats of the virtues of
<PB N="144" REF="309">
plants. Sidrac, the philo&s;opher of this &s;y&s;tem, was a&s;tro|nomer to an ea&s;tern king. He lived eight hundred and forty|&s;even years after Noah, of who&s;e book of a&s;tronomy he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He converts Bocchus, an idolatrous king of India, to the chri&s;tian faith, by whom he is invited to build a mighty tower again&s;t the inva&s;ions of a rival king of India. But the hi&s;tory, no le&s;s than the &s;ubject of this piece, di&s;plays the &s;tate, nature, and migrations of literature in the dark ages. After the death of Bocchus, Sidrac's book fell into the hands of a Chaldean renowned for piety. It then &s;ucce&s;&s;ively becomes the property of king Madian, Namaan the A&s;&s;yrian, and Grypho archbi&s;hop of Samaria. The latter had a prie&s;t named Demetrius, who brought it into Spain, and here it was tran&s;lated from the Greek into Latin. This tran&s;lation is &s;aid to be made at Toledo, by Roger de Palermo, a mino|rite friar, in the thirteenth century. A king of Spain then commanded it to be tran&s;lated from Latin into Arabic, and &s;ent it as a mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent to Emir Elmomenim, lord of Tunis. It was next given to Frederick the Second, em|peror of Germany, famous in the cru&s;ades. This work, which is of con&s;iderable length, was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, and will be mentioned on that account again.

<P>It is natural to conclude, that mo&s;t of the&s;e French ro|mances were current in England, either in the French ori|ginals, which were well under&s;tood at lea&s;t by the more polite readers, or el&s;e by tran&s;lation or imitation, as I have before hinted, when the romance of <HI>Richard Cuer de Lyon,</HI> in who&s;e prologue they are recited, was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h.

at lea&s;t, we &s;hall &s;oon produce actual proofs. A writer, who has con&s;idered the&s;e matters with much penetration and judg|ment, ob&s;erves, that probably from the reign of our Richard the fir&s;t, we are to date that remarkable intercommunica|tion and mutual exchange of compo&s;itions which we di&s;cover to have taken place at &s;ome early period between the French and Engli&s;h min&s;trels.

<P>Various cau&s;es concurred, in the mean time, to multiply books of chivalry among the French, and to give them a &s;uperiority over the Engli&s;h, not only in the number but in the excellence of tho&s;e compo&s;itions. Their barons lived in greater magnificence. Their feudal &s;y&s;tem flouri&s;hed on a more &s;umptuous, exten&s;ive, and la&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment. Schools were in&s;tituted in their ca&s;tles for initiating the young nobility in the rules and practice of chivalry. Their tilts and tournaments were celebrated with a higher degree of pomp; and their ideas of honour and gallantry were more exaggerated and refined.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="312">
We may add, what indeed has been before incidentally remarked, that their troubadours were the fir&s;t writers of metrical romances. But by what has been here advanced, I do not mean to in&s;inuate without any re&s;trictions, that the French entirely led the way in the&s;e compo&s;itions. Un|doubtedly the Provencial bards contributed much to the progre&s;s of Italian literature. Raimond the fourth of Ar|ragon, count of Provence, about the year 1220, a lover and a judge of letters, invited to his court the mo&s;t celebrated of the &s;ong&s;ters who profe&s;&s;ed to poli&s;h and adorn the Pro|vencial language by various &s;orts of poetry <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Giovan. Villani, I&s;tor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. vi. c. 92.</NOTE>. Charles the fir&s;t, his &s;on-in-law, and the inheritor of his virtues and dignities, conquered Naples, and carried into Italy a ta&s;te for the Provencial literature. At Florence e&s;pecially this ta&s;te prevailed, where he reigned many years with great &s;plendour, and where his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors re&s;ided. Soon afterwards the Roman court was removed to Provence <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Villani acquaints us, that Brunetto Latini, Dante's ma&s;ter, was the fir&s;t who at|tempted to poli&s;h the Florentines by im|proving their ta&s;te and &s;tyle; which he did by writing his grand work the TESORO in Provencial. He died in 1294. See Villan. ibid. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. ix. c. 135.</NOTE>. Hitherto the Latin language had only been in u&s;e. The Provencial writers e&s;tabli&s;hed a common dialect: and their examples convinced other nations, that the modern languages were no le&s;s adapted to compo&s;ition than tho&s;e of antiquity <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dante de&s;igned at fir&s;t that his <HI>Inferno,</HI> and Treati&s;e on monarchy, &s;hould appear in Latin. But finding that he could not &s;o effectually in that language impre&s;s his &s;a|tirical &s;trokes and political maxims on the laity, or illiterate, he altered his mind, and publi&s;hed tho&s;e pieces in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">talian. Had Petrarch written his <HI>Africa,</HI> his Eclogues, and his pro&s;e compo&s;itions in Italian, the li|terature of his country would much &s;ooner have arrived at perfection.</NOTE>. They introduced a love of reading, and diffu&s;ed a general and popular ta&s;te for poetry, by writing in a language intelligible to the ladies and the people. Their ver&s;es being conveyed in a familiar tongue, became the chief amu&s;ement of princes and feudal lords, who&s;e courts had now begun to a&s;&s;ume an air of
<PB N="148" REF="313">
greater brilliancy: a circum&s;tance which nece&s;&s;arily gave great encouragement to their profe&s;&s;ion, and by rendering the&s;e arts of ingenious entertainment univer&s;ally fa&s;hionable, imperceptibly laid the foundation of polite literature. From the&s;e beginnings it were ea&s;y to trace the progre&s;s of poetry to its perfection, through John de Meun in France, Dante in Italy, and Chaucer in England.</P>
<P>This prai&s;e mu&s;t undoubtedly be granted to the Provencial poets. But in the mean time, to recur to our original ar|gument, we &s;hould be cautious of a&s;&s;erting in general and indi&s;criminating terms, that the Provencial poets were the fir&s;t writers of metrical romance: at lea&s;t we &s;hould a&s;cer|tain, with rather more preci&s;ion than has been commonly u&s;ed on this &s;ubject, how far they may claim this merit. I am of opinion that there were two &s;orts of French trou|badours, who have not hitherto been &s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. If we diligently examine their hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find that the poetry of the fir&s;t troubadours con&s;i&s;ted in &s;atires, moral fables, allegories, and &s;entimental &s;onnets. So early as the year 1180, a tribunal called the <HI>Court of Love,</HI> was in&s;tituted both in Provence and Picardy, at which que&s;|tions in gallantry were decided. This in&s;titution furni&s;hed eternal matter for the poets, who threw the claims and argu|ments of the different parties into ver&s;e, in a &s;tyle that afterwards led the way to the &s;piritual conver&s;ations of Cyrus and Clelia <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This part of their character will be in&s;i&s;ted upon more at large when we come to &s;peak of Chaucer.</NOTE>. Fontenelle does not &s;cruple to acknowledge, that gallantry was the parent of French poetry <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Theatr. Fr. p. 13.</NOTE>. But to &s;ing romantic and chivalrous adventures was a very different ta&s;k, and required very different talents. The troubadours therefore who compo&s;ed metrical romances form a different &s;pecies, and ought always to be con&s;idered &s;eparately. And
<PB N="149" REF="314">
this latter cla&s;s &s;eems to have commenced at a later period, not till after the cru&s;ades had effected a great change in the manners and ideas of the we&s;tern world. In the mean time, I hazard a conjecture. Cinthio Giraldi &s;uppo&s;es, that the art of the troubadours, commonly called the <HI>Gay Science,</HI> was fir&s;t communicated from France to the Italians, and after|wards to the Spaniards <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Apud Huet, Orig. Rom. p. 108.</NOTE>. This perhaps may be true: but at the &s;ame time it is highly probable, as the Spaniards had their JUGLARES or convivial bards very early, as from long connection they were immediately and intimately acquaint|ed with the fictions of the Ara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ians, and as they were naturally fond of chivalry, that the troubadours of Provence in great mea&s;ure caught this turn of fabling from Spain. The communication, to mention no other obvious means of intercour&s;e in an affair of this nature, was ea&s;y through the ports of Toulon and Mar&s;eilles, by which the two na|tions carried on from early times a con&s;tant commerce. Even the French critics them&s;elves univer&s;ally allow, that the Spaniards, having learned rhyme from the Arabians, through this very channel conveyed it to Provence. Ta&s;&s;o preferred <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI> a romance originally written in Spain, by Va&s;co Lobeyra, before the year 1300 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nic. Antonius, Bibl. Hi&s;pan.

<P>VARIOUS matters &s;ugge&s;ted by the Prologue of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON, cited in the la&s;t &s;ection, have betrayed us into a long digre&s;&s;ion, and interrupted the regularity of our annals. But I could not neglect &s;o fair an opportunity of preparing the reader for tho&s;e metrical tales, which having acquired a new ca&s;t of fiction from the cru|&s;ades and a magnificence of manners from the encrea&s;e of chivalry, now began to be greatly multiplied, and as it were profe&s;&s;edly to form a &s;eparate &s;pecies of poetry. I now therefore re&s;ume the &s;eries, and proceed to give &s;ome &s;peci|mens of the Engli&s;h metrical romances which appeared be|fore or about the reign of Edward the &s;econd: and although mo&s;t of the&s;e pieces continued to be &s;ung by the min&s;trels in the halls of our magnificent ance&s;tors for &s;ome centuries afterwards, yet as their fir&s;t appearance may mo&s;t probably be dated at this period, they properly coincide in this place with the tenour of our hi&s;tory. In the mean time, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that by frequent repetition and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes of language during many generations, their original &s;implicity mu&s;t have been in &s;ome degree corrupted. Yet &s;ome of the &s;pecimens are extracted from manu&s;cripts writ|ten in the reign of Edward the third. Others indeed from printed copies, where the editors took great liberties in ac|commodating the language to the times. However in &s;uch as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uffered mo&s;t from depravations of this &s;ort, the &s;ub&s;tance of the ancient &s;tyle &s;till remains, and at lea&s;t the &s;tructure of the &s;tory. On the whole, we mean to give the reader an idea of tho&s;e popular heroic tales in ver&s;e, profe&s;&s;edly written for the harp, which began to be multiplied among us about the beginning of the fourteenth

This <HI>fyre grekys,</HI> or Grecian fire, &s;eems to be a compo&s;i|tion belonging to the Arabian chemi&s;try. It is frequently mentioned by the Byzantine hi&s;torians, and was very much u&s;ed in the wars of the middle ages, both by &s;ea and land. It was a &s;ort of wild-fire, &s;aid to be inextingui&s;hable by water, and chiefly u&s;ed for burning &s;hips, again&s;t which it was thrown in pots or phials by the hand. In land engagements it &s;eems to have been di&s;charged by machines con&s;tructed on purpo&s;e. The oriental Greeks pretended that this artificial fire was invented by Callinicus, an architect of Helio|polis, under Con&s;tantine; and that Con&s;tantine prohi|bited them from communicating the manner of making it to any foreign people. It was however in common u&s;e among the nations confederated with the Byzantines: and Anna Commena has given an account of its ingredients <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Du Cange, Not. ad Joinvil. p. 71.

<P>Richard arming him&s;elf is a curious Gothic picture. It is certainly a genuine picture, and drawn with &s;ome &s;pirit; as is the &s;hock of the two necromantic &s;teeds, and other parts of this de&s;cription. The combat of Richard and the Soldan, on the event of which the chri&s;tian army got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Babylon, is probably the DUEL OF KING RICHARD, painted on the walls of a chamber in the royal palace of Clarendon <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. p. 114.</NOTE>. The &s;oldan is repre&s;ented as meeting Richard with a hawk on his fi&s;t, to &s;hew indifference, or a contempt of his adver&s;ary; and that he came rather prepared for the chace, than the combat. Indeed in the feudal times, and long afterwards, no gentleman appeared on hor&s;eback, unle&s;s going to battle, without a hawk on his fi&s;t. In the <HI>Tape&s;try of the Norman conque&s;t,</HI> Harold is exhibited on hor&s;eback, with a hawk on his fi&s;t, and his dogs running before him, going on an emba&s;&s;y from king Edward the Confe&s;&s;or to William Duke of Normandy <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The hawk on the fi&s;t was a mark of great nobility. We frequently find it, upon antique &s;eals and miniatures, attri|buted to per&s;ons of both &s;exes. So &s;acred was this bird e&s;teemed, that it was forbid|den in a code of Charlemagne's laws, for any one to give his hawk or his &s;word as part of his ran&s;om. <Q REND="inline">"In compo&s;itionem Wirigildi volumus ut ea dentur quae in lege continentur excepto <HI>accipitre et &s;patha.</HI>"</Q> Lindebrog. Cod. Leg. Antiq. p. 895. In the year 1337, the bi&s;hop of Ely excom|municated certain per&s;ons for &s;tealing a hawk, &s;itting on her perch, in the cloi&s;ters of the abbey of Bermond&s;ey in Southwark.

&s;tudied, and the romantic poet &s;ought to gain new attention, and to recommend his &s;tory, by giving it the advantage of a plan. Mo&s;t of the old metrical romances are, from their nature, &s;uppo&s;ed to be incoherent rhap&s;odies. Yet many of them have a regular integrity, in which every part contri|butes to produce an intended end. Through various ob&s;ta|cles and difficulties one point is kept in view, till the final and general cata&s;trophe is brought about by a plea&s;ing and unexpected &s;urpri&s;e. As a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t, and as it lies in a narrow compa&s;s, I will develope the plan of the fable now before us, which pre&s;erves at lea&s;t a coincidence of events, and an uniformity of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>A king's daughter of England, extremely beautiful, is &s;ol|licited in marriage by numerous potentates of various king|doms. The king her father vows, that of all the&s;e &s;uitors, that champion alone &s;hall win his daughter who can unhor&s;e him at a tournament. This they all attempt, but in vain. The king every year a&s;&s;i&s;ted at an anniver&s;ary ma&s;s for the &s;oul of his decea&s;ed queen, who was interred in an abbey at &s;ome di&s;tance from his ca&s;tle. In the journey thither, the prince&s;s &s;trays from her dam&s;els in a &s;olitary fore&s;t: &s;he is di&s;covered by a knight in rich armour, who by many &s;ollici|tations prevails over her cha&s;tity, and, at parting, gives her a &s;word without a point, which he charges her to keep &s;afe; together with a pair of gloves, which will fit no hands but her own <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gloves were antiently a co&s;tly article of dre&s;s, and richly decorated.

At length &s;he finds the road to her father's ca&s;tle, where, after &s;ome time, to avoid di&s;covery, &s;he is &s;e|cretly delivered of a boy. Soon after the delivery, the prince&s;s having carefully placed the child in a cradle, with twenty pounds in gold, ten pounds in &s;ilver, the gloves given her by the &s;trange knight, and a letter, con&s;igns him to one
<PB N="183" REF="348">
of her maidens, who carries him by night, and leaves him in a wood, near a hermitage, which &s;he di&s;cerned by the light of the moon. The hermit in the morning di&s;covers the child; reads the letter, by which it appears that the gloves will fit no lady but the boy's mother, educates him till he is twenty years of age, and at parting gives him the gloves found with him in the cradle, telling him that they will fit no lady but his own mother. The youth, who is called Degore, &s;ets forward to &s;eek adventures, and &s;aves an earl from a terrible dragon, which he kills. The earl in|vites him to his palace, dubs him a knight, gives him a hor&s;e and armour, and offers him half his territory. Sir Degore refu&s;es to accept this offer, unle&s;s the gloves, which he had received from his fo&s;ter-father the hermit, will fit any lady of his court. All the ladies of the earl's court are called before him, and among the re&s;t the earl's daughter, but upon trial the gloves will fit none of them. He therefore takes leave of the earl, proceeds on his adventures, and meets with a large train of knights; he is informed that they were going to tourney with the king of England, who had promi&s;ed his daughter to that knight who could conquer him in &s;ingle combat. They tell him of the many barons and earls whom the king had foiled in &s;everal trials. Sir Degore, how|ever, enters the li&s;ts, overthrows the king, and obtains the prince&s;s. As the knight is a perfect &s;tranger, &s;he &s;ubmits to her father's commands with much reluctance. He marries her; but in the mid&s;t of the &s;olemnities which preceded the con&s;ummation, recollects the gloves which the hermit had given him, and propo&s;es to make an experiment with them on the hands of his bride. The prince&s;s, on &s;eeing the gloves, changed colour, claimed them for her own, and drew them on with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. She declares to Sir Degore that &s;he was his mother, and gives him an account of his birth: &s;he told him that the knight his father gave her a pointle&s;s &s;word, which was to be delivered to no per&s;on but the &s;on
<PB N="184" REF="349">
that &s;hould be born of their &s;tolen embraces. Sir Degore draws the &s;word, and contemplates its breadth and length with wonder: is &s;uddenly &s;eized with a de&s;ire of finding out his father. He &s;ets forward on this &s;earch, and on his way enters a ca&s;tle, where he is entertained at &s;upper by fifteen beautiful dam&s;els. The lady of the ca&s;tle invites him to her bed, but in vain; and he is lulled a&s;leep by the &s;ound of a harp. Various artifices are u&s;ed to divert him from his pur|&s;uit, and the lady even engages him to encounter a giant in her cau&s;e <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">All the romances have &s;uch an ob&s;tacle as this. They have all an enchantre&s;s, who detains the knight from his que&s;t by objects of plea&s;ure; and who is nothing more than the Calyp&s;o of Homer, the Dido of Virgil, and the Armida of Ta&s;&s;o.</NOTE>. But Sir Degore rejects all her temptations, and pur&s;ues his journey. In a fore&s;t he meets a knight richly accoutred, who demands the rea&s;on why Sir Degore pre&s;umed to enter his fore&s;t without permi&s;&s;ion. A combat en&s;ues. In the mid&s;t of the conte&s;t, the combatants being both un|hor&s;ed, the &s;trange knight ob&s;erving the &s;word of his ad|ver&s;ary not only to be remarkably long and broad, but with|out a point, begs a truce for a moment. He fits the &s;word to a point which he had always kept, and which had for|merly broken off in an encounter with a giant; and by this circum&s;tance di&s;covers Sir Degore to be his &s;on. They both return into England, and Sir Degore's father is married to the prince&s;s his mother.</P>

Engli&s;h poetry &s;uffer, while &s;o many pieces of this kind &s;till remain concealed and forgotten in our manu&s;cript libraries. They contain in common with the pro&s;e-romances, to mo&s;t of which indeed they gave ri&s;e, amu&s;ing images of antient cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions, not el&s;ewhere to be found, or at lea&s;t not otherwi&s;e &s;o &s;trikingly delineated: and they pre&s;erve pure and unmixed, tho&s;e fables of chivalry which formed the ta&s;te and awakened the imagination of our elder Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics. The antiquaries of former times overlooked or re|jected the&s;e valuable remains, which they de&s;pi&s;ed as fal&s;e and frivolous; and employed their indu&s;try in reviving ob|&s;cure fragments of unin&s;tructive morality or unintere&s;ting hi&s;tory. But in the pre&s;ent age we are beginning to make ample amends: in which the curio&s;ity of the antiquarian is connected with ta&s;te and genius, and his re&s;earches tend to di&s;play the progre&s;s of human manners, and to illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As a further illu&s;tration of the general &s;ubject, and many particulars, of this &s;ection and the three la&s;t, I will add a new proof of the reverence in which &s;uch &s;tories were held, and of the familiarity with which they mu&s;t have been known, by our ance&s;tors. The&s;e fables were not only perpetually repeated at their fe&s;tivals, but were the con&s;tant objects of their eyes. The very walls of their apartments were clothed with ro|mantic hi&s;tory. Tape&s;try was antiently the fa&s;hionable fur|niture of our hou&s;es, and it was chiefly filled with lively repre&s;entations of this &s;ort.

<P>Edward the &s;econd is &s;aid to have carried with him to the &s;iege of Stirling ca&s;tle, in Scotland, a poet named Robert Ba&s;ton. He was a Carmelite friar of Scarborough; and the king intended that Ba&s;ton, being an eye-witne&s;s of the ex|pedition, &s;hould celebrate his conque&s;t of Scotland in ver&s;e. Holling&s;head, an hi&s;torian not often remarkable for pene|tration, mentions this circum&s;tance as a &s;ingular proof of Edward's pre&s;umption and confidence in his undertaking again&s;t Scotland: but a poet &s;eems to have been a &s;tated officer in the royal retinue when the king went to war <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Leland. Script. Brit. p. 338. Hol|ling&s;h. Hi&s;t. ii. p. 217. 220. Tanner men|tions, as a poet of England, one Guliel|mus Peregrinus, who accompanied Richard the fir&s;t into the holy land, and &s;ung his at|chievements there in a Latin poem, entitled ODOEPORICON RICARDI REGIS, lib. i. It is dedicated to Herbert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Stephen Turnham, a cap|tain in the expedition. He flouri&s;hed about A. D. 1200. Tann. Bibl. p. 591. See Vo&s;&s;. Hi&s;t. Lat. p. 441. He is called <Q REND="inline">"poeta per eam aetatem excellens."</Q> See Bal. iii. 45. Pit&s;. 266.</NOTE>. Ba&s;ton, however, appears to have been chiefly a Latin poet, and therefore does not properly fall into our &s;eries.

For the &s;ame rea&s;on I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over a Latin piece, called a comedy, written in this reign, perhaps by Peter Babyon; who by Bale is &s;tyled an admirable rheto|rician and poet, and flouri&s;hed about the year 1317. This comedy is thus entitled in the Bodleian manu&s;cript, <HI>De Ba|bione et Croceo domino Babionis et Viola filia&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra Babionis quam Croceus duxit invito Babione, et Pecula uxore Babionis et Fodio &s;uo,</HI> &amp;c <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Arch. B. 52.</NOTE>. It is written in long and &s;hort Latin ver&s;es, without any appearance of dialogue. In what manner, if ever, this piece was repre&s;ented theatrically, cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;covered or a&s;certained. Unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it to have been recited by one or more of the characters concerned, at &s;ome public entertainment. The &s;tory is in Gower's CON|FESSIO AMANTIS. Whether Gower had it from this per|formance I will not enquire. It appears at lea&s;t that he took it from &s;ome previous book.</P>

<P>In the mean time it &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that this piece has been attributed to Peter Babyon, on account of the likene&s;s of the name BABIO, e&s;pecially as he is a ridiculous character. On the whole, there is nothing dramatic in the &s;tructure of this nominal comedy; and it has certainly no claim to that title, only as it contains a familiar and comic &s;tory carried
<PB N="234" REF="399">
on with much &s;currilous &s;atire intended to rai&s;e mirth. But it was not uncommon to call any &s;hort poem, not &s;erious or tragic, a comedy. In the Bodleian manu&s;cript, which com|prehends Babyon's poem ju&s;t mentioned, there follows CO|MEDIA DE GETA: this is in Latin long and &s;hort ver&s;es <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Carmina compo&s;uit, voluitque placere poeta.</NOTE>, and has no marks of dialogue <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">f. 121.</NOTE>.

<P>It is certain, that the&s;e MIRACLE-PLAYS were the fir&s;t of our dramatic exhibitions. But as the&s;e pieces frequently re|quired the introduction of allegorical characters, &s;uch as Charity, Sin, Death, Hope, Faith, or the like, and as the common poetry of the times, e&s;pecially among the French, began to deal much in allegory, at length plays were formed entirely con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch per&s;onifications. The&s;e were called MORALITIES. The miracle-plays, or MYSTERIES, were to|tally de&s;titute of invention or plan: they tamely repre&s;ented &s;tories according to the letter of &s;cripture, or the re&s;pective legend. But the MORALITIES indicate dawnings of the dra|matic art: they contain &s;ome rudiments of a plot, and even attempt to delineate characters, and to paint manners. From hence the gradual tran&s;ition to real hi&s;torical per&s;on|ages was natural and obvious. It may be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that many licentious plea&s;antries were &s;ometimes introduced in the&s;e religious repre&s;entations. This might imperceptibly lead the way to &s;ubjects entirely profane, and to comedy, and perhaps earlier than is imagined. In a<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">MSS. Digb. 134. Bibl.

It is in an enlightened age only
<PB N="243" REF="408">
that &s;ubjects of &s;cripture hi&s;tory would be &s;upported with proper dignity. But then an enlightened age would not have cho&s;en &s;uch &s;ubjects for theatrical exhibition. It is certain that our ance&s;tors intended no &s;ort of impiety by the&s;e mon&s;trous and unnatural mixtures. Neither the writers nor the &s;pectators &s;aw the impropriety, nor paid a &s;eparate attention to the comic and the &s;rious part of the&s;e motley &s;cenes; at lea&s;t they were per&s;uaded that the &s;olemnity of the &s;ubject covered or excu&s;ed all incongruities. They had no ju&s;t idea of decorum, con&s;equently but little &s;en&s;e of the ri|diculous: what appears to us to be the highe&s;t burle&s;que, on them would have made no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t not wonder at this, in an age when courage, devotion, and ignorance, compo&s;ed the character of European manners; when the knight going to a tournament, fir&s;t invoked his God, then his mi&s;tre&s;s, and afterwards proceeded with a &s;afe con&s;cience and great re&s;olution to engage his antagoni&s;t.

<P>THE next poet in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is one who de&s;erves more attention on various accounts. This is Robert Long|lande, author of the poem called the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN, a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cular prie&s;t, and a fellow of Oriel college, in Oxford. He flouri&s;hed about the year 1350 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I have here followed a date commonly received. But it may be ob&s;erved, that there is in this poem an allu&s;ion to the fall of Edward the &s;econd. The &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ge of Calais is al&s;o mentioned as a recent fact; and <HI>Bribery</HI> accu&s;es <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of ob&s;tructing the conque&s;t of France. See more in Ob&s;erva|tions on the Fairy Queen, ii. &sect;. xi. p. 281.</NOTE>. This poem contains a &s;eries of di&s;tinct vi&s;ions, which the author imagines him&s;elf to have &s;een, while he was &s;leeping, after a long ramble on Malverne-hills in Worce&s;ter&s;hire. It is a &s;atire on the vices of almo&s;t every profe&s;&s;ion: but particu|larly on the corruptions of the clergy, and the ab&s;urdities of &s;uper&s;tition. The&s;e are ridiculed with much humour and &s;pirit, couched under a &s;trong vein of allegorical invention. But in&s;tead of availing him&s;elf of the ri&s;ing and rapid im|provements of the Engli&s;h language, Longland prefers and adopts the &s;tyle of the Anglo-Saxon poets. Nor did he make the&s;e writers the models of his language only: he likewi&s;e imitates their alliterative ver&s;ification, which con|&s;i&s;ted in u&s;ing an aggregate of words beginning with the &s;ame letter. He has therefore rejected rhyme, in the place of which he thinks it &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;titute a perpetual al|literation. But this impo&s;ed con&s;traint of &s;eeking identical initials, and the affectation of ob&s;olete Engli&s;h, by demand|ing a con&s;tant and nece&s;&s;ary departure from the natural and obvious forms of expre&s;&s;ion, while it circum&s;cribed the powers of our author's genius, contributed al&s;o to render his
<PB N="267" REF="432">
manner extremely perplexed, and to di&s;gu&s;t the reader with ob&s;curities. The &s;atire is conducted by the agency of &s;everal allegorical per&s;onages, &s;uch as Avarice, Bribery, Simony, Theology, Con&s;cience, &amp;c. There is much imagination in the following picture, which is intended to repre&s;ent human life, and its various occupations.</P>

The di&s;|play of merchandi&s;e, and the conflux of cu&s;tomers, at the&s;e principal and almo&s;t only emporia of dome&s;tic commerce, was pro|digious: and they were therefore often held on open and exten&s;ive plains. One of the chief of them &s;eems to have been that of St. Giles's hill or down near Win|che&s;ter, to which our poet here refers. It was in&s;tituted and given as a kind of re|venue to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, by William the conqueror; who by his charter permitted it to continue for three days. But in con&s;equence of new royal grants, Henry the third prolonged its continuance to &s;ixteen days. Its juri&s;diction extended &s;even miles round, and comprehended even Southampton, then a capital trading town: and all merchants who &s;old wares within that circuit, forfeited them to the bi&s;hop. Officers were placed at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, at bridges and other avenues of acce&s;s to the fair, to exact toll of all merchandi&s;e pa&s;&s;ing that way. In the mean time, all &s;hops in the city of Winche&s;ter were &s;hut. In the fair was a court called the pavilion, at which the bi&s;hop's ju&s;ti|ciaries and other officers a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with power to try cau&s;es of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rious &s;orts for &s;even miles round: nor among other &s;ingular claims could any lord of a manor hold a court-baron within the &s;aid circuit, without licence from the pavilion. During this time, the bi&s;hop was empowered to take toll of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">very load or parcel of goods pa&s;&s;ing through the gates of the city. On Saint Giles's eve, the mayor, bailiffs, and citizens of the city of Winche&s;ter, delivered the keys of the
four city gates to the bi&s;hop's officers; who, during the &s;aid &s;ixteen days, appointed a mayor and bailiff of their own to govern the city, and al&s;o a coroner to act within the &s;aid city. Tenants of the bi&s;hop, who held lands by doing &s;ervice at the pavilion, attended the &s;ame with hor&s;es and armour, not only to do &s;uit at the court there, but to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the bi&s;hop's officers in the execution of writs and other &s;ervices.

I cannot help tak|ing notice of a pa&s;&s;age in Piers Plowman, which &s;hews how the reigning pa&s;&s;ion for chivalry infected the ideas and expre&s;&s;ions of the writers of this period. The poet is de&s;cribing the crucifixion, and &s;peaking of the per&s;on who pierced our Saviour's &s;ide with a &s;pear.

The author, in the character of a plain uninformed per&s;on, pretends to be ignorant of his creed; to be in&s;tructed in the articles of which, he applies by turns to the four orders of mendicant friers. This circum&s;tance affords an obvious occa&s;ion of expo&s;ing in lively colours the tricks of tho&s;e &s;ocieties. After &s;o unexpected a di&s;appoint|ment, he meets one Pierce, or Peter, a plowman, who re|&s;olves his doubts, and teaches him the principles of true religion. In a copy of the CREDE lately pre&s;ented to me by the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, and once belonging to Mr. Pope, the latter in his own hand has in&s;erted the following ab&s;tract of its plan. <Q REND="inline">"An ignorant plain man having learned his Pater-no&s;ter and Ave-mary, wants to learn his creed. He a&s;ks &s;everal religious men of the &s;everal orders to teach it him. Fir&s;t of a friar Minor, who bids him beware of the Carmelites, and a&s;&s;ures him they can teach him no|thing, de&s;cribing their faults, &amp;c.

<P>The language of the CREDE is le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed and ob|&s;cure than that of the VISION. But before I proceed to a &s;pecimen, it may not be perhaps improper to prepare the reader, by giving an outline of the con&s;titution and cha|racter of the four orders of mendicant friars, the object of our poet's &s;atire: an enquiry in many re&s;pects connected with the general purport of this hi&s;tory, and which, in this place at lea&s;t, cannot be deemed a digre&s;&s;ion, as it will il|lu&s;trate the main &s;ubject, and explain many particular pa&s;|&s;ages, of the PLOWMAN'S CREDE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">And of &s;ome perhaps quoted above from the VISION.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Long before the thirteenth century, the mona&s;tic orders, as we have partly &s;een in the preceding poem, in con&s;equence of their ample revenues, had degenerated from their primi|tive au&s;terity, and were totally given up to luxury and indo|lence. Hence they became both unwilling and unable to execute the purpo&s;es of their e&s;tabli&s;hment: to in&s;truct the people, to check the growth of here&s;ies, or to promote in any re&s;pect the true intere&s;ts of the church. They for&s;ook all their religious obligations, de&s;pi&s;ed the authority of their &s;uperiors, and were abandoned without &s;hame or remor&s;e to every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;ipation and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. About the beginning therefore of the thirteenth century, the condition and circum&s;tances of the church rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="289" REF="454">
to remedy the&s;e evils, by introducing a new order of religious, who being de&s;titute of fixed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by the &s;everity of their manners, a profe&s;&s;ed contempt of riches, and an unwearied per&s;everance in the duties of preaching and prayer, might re&s;tore re&s;pect to the mona&s;tic in&s;titution, and recover the honours of the church. The&s;e were the four orders of mendicant or begging friars, commonly deno|minated the Franci&s;cans, the Dominicans, the Carmelites, and the Augu&s;tines <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The Franci&s;cans were often &s;tyled friars-minors, or minorites, and grey|friars: the Dominicans, friars-preachers, and &s;ometimes black-friars: The Carme|lites white-friars; and the Au&s;tins grey|friars. The fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Do|minicans in England was at Oxford in 1221. Of the Franci&s;cans at Canterbury. The&s;e two were the mo&s;t eminent of the four orders.

<P>The&s;e &s;ocieties &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t, not only in the purity of their lives, but in the number of their privileges, and the multitude of their members. Not to mention the &s;ucce&s;s which attends all novelties, their reputation aro&s;e quickly to an amazing height. The popes, among other uncommon immunities, allowed them the liberty of travel|ling wherever they plea&s;ed, of conver&s;ing with per&s;ons of all ranks, of in&s;tructing the youth and the people in general, and of hearing confe&s;&s;ions, without re&s;erve or re&s;triction: and as on the&s;e occa&s;ions, which gave them opportunities of appearing in public and con&s;picuous &s;ituations, they ex|hibited more &s;triking marks of gravity and &s;anctity than were ob&s;ervable in the deportment and conduct of the mem|bers of other mona&s;teries, they were regarded with the highe&s;t e&s;teem and veneration throughout all the countries of Europe.</P>
<P>In the mean time they gained &s;till greater re&s;pect, by cul|tivating the literature then in vogue, with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i|duity and &s;ucce&s;s. Gianoni &s;ays, that mo&s;t of the theological

The mo&s;t learned &s;cholars in the univer&s;ity of Oxford, at the clo&s;e of the thirteenth century, were Franci&s;can friars: and long after this period, the Franci&s;cans appear to have been the &s;ole &s;upport and ornament of that univer&s;ity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>This circum&s;tance in &s;ome degree rou&s;|ed the monks from their indolence, and induced the greater mona&s;teries to procure the foundation of &s;mall colleges in the uni|ver&s;ities for the education of their novices. At Oxford the monks had al&s;o &s;chools which bore the name of their re&s;pective orders: and there were &s;chools in that uni|ver&s;ity which were appropriated to particu|lar mona&s;teries.

But we do not find, that in con&s;equence of all the&s;e efforts, the monks made a much greater figure in literature.</P>
<P>In this rivalry which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the mendicants and the monks, the latter &s;ometimes availed them&s;elves of their riches: and with a view to attract popula|rity, and to eclip&s;e the growing lu&s;tre of the former, proceeded to their degrees in the univer&s;ities with prodigious parade. In the year 1298, William de Brooke, a Be|nedictine of Saint Peter's abbey at Glou|ce&s;ter, took the degree of doctor in divi|nity at Oxford. He was attended on this important occa&s;ion by the abbot and whole convent of Glouce&s;ter, the abbots of We&s;t|min&s;ter, Reading, Abingdon, Eve&s;ham, and Malme&s;bury, with one hundred noble|men and e&s;quires, on hor&s;es richly capari|&s;oned.

<P>The buildings of the mendicant mona&s;teries, e&s;pecially in England, were remarkably magnificent, and commonly much exceeded tho&s;e of the endowed convents of the &s;econd mag|nitude. As the&s;e fraternities were profe&s;&s;edly poor, and could not from their original in&s;titution receive e&s;tates, the munificence of their benefactors was employed in adorning their hou&s;es with &s;tately refectories and churches: and for the&s;e and other purpo&s;es they did nor want addre&s;s to pro|cure multitudes of patrons, which was facilitated by the notion of their &s;uperior &s;anctity. It was fa&s;hionable for per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank to bequeath their bodies to be buried in the friary churches, which were con&s;equently filled with &s;umptuous &s;hrines and &s;uperb monuments <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Their churches were e&s;teemed more &s;acred than others.</NOTE>.

Mi&s;cellan. tom. iv. 490. vii. 392.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the whole, two of the&s;e mendicant in&s;titutions, the Dominicans and the Franci&s;cans, for the &s;pace of near three centuries, appear to have governed the European church and &s;tate with an ab&s;olute and univer&s;al &s;way: they filled, during that period, the mo&s;t eminent eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil &s;tations, taught in the univer&s;ities with an authority which &s;ilenced all oppo&s;ition, and maintained the di&s;puted prerogative of the Roman pontiff again&s;t the united influence of prelates and kings, with a vigour only to be paralleled by its &s;ucce&s;s. The Dominicans and Franci&s;cans were, before the Reforma|tion, exactly what the Je&s;uits have been &s;ince. They di&s;re|garded their mona&s;tic character and profe&s;&s;ion, and were employed, not only in &s;piritual matters, but in temporal affairs of the greate&s;t con&s;equence; in compo&s;ing the dif|ferences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, and con|certing alliances: they pre&s;ided in cabinet councils, levied national &s;ub&s;idies, influenced courts, and managed the ma|chines of every important operation and event, both in the religious and political world.</P>
<P>From what has been here &s;aid it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the mendicants at length became univer&s;ally odious. The high e&s;teem in which they were held, and the tran&s;cendent degree of authority which they had a&s;&s;umed, only &s;erved to
<PB N="295" REF="460">
render them obnoxious to the clergy of every rank, to the mona&s;teries of other orders, and to the univer&s;ities. It was not from ignorance, but from a knowledge of mankind, that they were active in propagating &s;uper&s;titious notions, which they knew were calculated to captivate the multitude, and to &s;trengthen the papal intere&s;t; yet at the &s;ame time, from the vanity of di&s;playing an uncommon &s;agacity of thought, and a &s;uperior &s;kill in theology, they affected no|velties in doctrine, which introduced dangerous errors, and tended to &s;hake the pillars of orthodoxy. Their ambition was unbounded, and their arrogance intolerable. Their en|crea&s;ing numbers became, in many &s;tates, an enormous and unweildy burthen to the commonwealth. They had abu&s;ed the powers and privileges which had been entru&s;ted to them; and the common &s;en&s;e of mankind could not long be blinded or deluded by the palpable frauds and artifices, which the&s;e rapacious zealots &s;o notoriou&s;ly practi&s;ed for en|riching their convents. In England, the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ted the perpetual encroachments of the Dominicans <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wood, ut &s;upr. i. 150. 154. 196.</NOTE>; and many of our theologi&s;ts attacked all the four orders with great vehemence and &s;everity. Exclu&s;ive of the jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities which naturally &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween four rival in&s;titutions, their vi&s;ionary refinements, and love of di&s;putation, introduced among them the mo&s;t violent di&s;&s;en&s;ions. The Dominicans aimed at popularity, by an ob&s;tinate denial of the immaculate conception. Their pretended &s;anctity became at length a term of reproach, and their learning fell into di&s;credit. As polite letters and ge|neral knowledge encrea&s;ed, their &s;peculative and pedantic divinity gave way to a more liberal turn of thinking, and a more per&s;picuous mode of writing. Bale, who was him&s;elf a Carmelite friar, &s;ays, that his order, which was eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;chola&s;tic erudition, began to lo&s;e their e&s;timation about the year 1460.

I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e the walls of the&s;e apartments were re&s;pectively adorned with paintings of each. Geneura is Arthur's queen. In the pipe-rolls of Henry the third we have this notice, A.

This was a recent and notorious in&s;tance. But in this appointment the king probably paid a compliment to that prelate's &s;ingular talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, his activity, circum&s;pection, and management, rather than to any &s;cientific and profe&s;&s;ed &s;kill in architecture which he might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It &s;eems to me that he was only a &s;upervi&s;or or comptroller on this occa&s;ion. It was common to depute churchmen to this department, from an idea of their &s;uperior prudence and probity. Thus John, the prior of St. Swithin's at Winche&s;ter in 1280, is commi&s;&s;ioned by brief from the king, to &s;upervi&s;e large repairs done by the &s;heriff in the ca&s;tle of Winche&s;ter, and the royal manor of Wol|mer.

among other things, that the clergy &s;hould not po&s;|&s;e&s;s e&s;tates, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical ceremonies ob&s;tructed true devotion, and that mendicant friars, the particular object of our Plowman's CREDE, were a public and in&s;upportable grievance. But Wickliffe, whom Mr. Hume pronounces to have been an enthu&s;ia&s;t, like many other reformers, carried his ideas of purity too far; and, as at lea&s;t it appears from the two fir&s;t of the&s;e opinions, under the de&s;ign of de&s;troying &s;uper&s;tition, his undi&s;tingui&s;hing zeal attacked even the nece&s;&s;ary aids of religion. It was certainly a lucky circum&s;tance, that Wickliffe quarrelled with the pope. His attacks on &s;uper&s;tition at fir&s;t probably proceeded from re&s;entment. Wickliffe, who was profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Oxford, finding on many occa&s;ions not only his own pro|vince invaded, but even the privileges of the univer&s;ity fre|quently violated by the preten&s;ions of the mendicants, gra|tified his warmth of temper by throwing out &s;ome &s;light cen&s;ures again&s;t all the four orders, and the popes their principal patrons and abettors. Soon afterwards he was deprived of the warden&s;hip of Canterbury hall, by the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, who &s;ub&s;tituted a monk in his place. Upon this he appealed to the pope, who confirmed the archie|pi&s;copal &s;entence, by way of rebuke for the freedom with which he had treated the mona&s;tic profe&s;&s;ion. Wickliffe, highly exa&s;perated at this u&s;age, immediately gave a loo&s;e to his indignation, and without re&s;traint or di&s;tinction attacked
<PB N="308" REF="475">
in numerous &s;ermons and treati&s;es, not only the &s;candalous enormities of the whole body of monks, but even the u&s;ur|pations of the pontifical power it&s;elf, with other eccle&s;ia&s;tical corruptions. Having expo&s;ed the&s;e palpable abu&s;es with a ju&s;t abhorrence, he ventured &s;till farther, and proceeded to examine and refute with great learning and penetration the ab&s;urd doctrines which prevailed in the religious &s;y&s;tem of his age: he not only exhorted the laity to &s;tudy the &s;criptures, but tran&s;lated the bible into Engli&s;h for general u&s;e and popular in&s;pection. Whatever were his motives, it is certain t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at the&s;e efforts enlarged the notions of mankind, and &s;owed tho&s;e &s;eeds of a revolution in religion, which were quickened at length and brought to maturity by a favourable coinci|dence of circum&s;tances, in an age when the encrea&s;ing growth of literature and curio&s;ity naturally led the way to innovation and improvement. But a vi&s;ible diminution of the authority of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, in England at lea&s;t, had been long growing from other cau&s;es. The di&s;gu&s;t which the laity had contracted from the numerous and arbitrary en|croachments both of the court of Rome, and of their own clergy, had greatly weaned the kingdom from &s;uper&s;tition; and con&s;picuous &s;ymptoms had appeared, on various occa|&s;ions, of a general de&s;ire to &s;hake off the intolerable bondage of papal oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;uppo&s;ed above, it is not quite certain, that Longland was the fir&s;t who led the way in this &s;ingular &s;pecies of ver&s;ification.

It is ea&s;y to conceive how the&s;e circum&s;tances contributed to give him the merit of an inventor on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ingenious doctor Percy has exhibited &s;pecimens of two or three other poems belonging to this cla&s;s <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the Metr. of P. P. Vi&s;. p. 8. &s;eq.</NOTE>. One of the&s;e is entitled DEATH AND LIFE: it con&s;i&s;ts of two hun|dred and twenty-nine lines, and is divided into two parts or <HI>Fitts.</HI> It begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Chri&s;t chri&s;ten king that on the cro&s;s tholed,</L>
<L>Hadde paines and pa&s;&s;yons to defend our &s;oules;</L>
<L>Give us grace on the ground the greatlye to &s;erve</L>
<L>For that royall red blood that rann from thy &s;ide.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;ubject of this piece is a VISION, containing a conte&s;t for &s;uperiority between <HI>Our lady Dame</HI> LIFE, and the <HI>ugly fiend</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="480">
<HI>Dame</HI> DEATH: who with their &s;everal attributes and conco|mitants are per&s;onified in a beautiful vein of allegorical paint|ing. <HI>Dame</HI> LIFE is thus forcibly de&s;cribed.</P>
<Q><L>Shee was brighter of her blee than was the bright &s;onn:</L>
<L>Her rud redder than the ro&s;e that on the ri&s;e hangeth:</L>
<L>Meekely &s;miling with her mouth, and merry in her lookes;</L>
<L>Ever laughing for love, as &s;hee like would:</L>
<L>And as &s;he came by the bankes the boughes eche one</L>

<L>And the gra&s;&s;e that was gray grened belive.</L></Q>
<P>The figure of DEATH follows, which is equally bold and expre&s;&s;ive. Another piece of this kind, al&s;o quoted by doc|tor Percy, is entitled CHEVELERE ASSIGNE, or DE CIGNE, that is the <HI>Knight of the Swan.</HI> This is a romance which is extant in a pro&s;e tran&s;lation from the French, among Mr. Garrick's noble collection of old plays <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">K. vol. 10. <Q REND="inline">"Imprinted at London by me Wylliam Copland."</Q> There is an edition on parchment by W. de Worde, 1512. <Q REND="inline">"Newly tran&s;lated out of Fren&s;he into Engly&s;he at thin&s;tigacion of the puy&s;&s;aunt prynce lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame."</Q> Here I under&s;tand French pro&s;e.</NOTE>.

<P>As we are approaching to Chaucer, let us here &s;tand &s;till, and take a retro&s;pect of the general manners. The tourna|ments and carou&s;als of our antient princes, by forming &s;plendid a&s;&s;emblies of both &s;exes, while they inculcated the mo&s;t liberal &s;entiments of honour and heroi&s;m, undoubtedly contributed to introduce ideas of courte&s;y, and to encou|rage decorum. Yet the national manners &s;till retained a great degree of ferocity, and the ceremonies of the mo&s;t refined courts in Europe had often a mixture of barbari&s;m, which rendered them ridiculous. This ab&s;urdity will always appear at periods when men are &s;o far civili&s;ed as to have lo&s;t their native &s;implicity, and yet have not attained ju&s;t ideas of politene&s;s and propriety. Their luxury was inelegant, their plea&s;ures indelicate, their pomp cumber&s;ome and un|wieldy. In the mean time it may &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, that the many &s;chools of philo&s;ophy which flouri&s;hed in the middle ages, &s;hould not have corrected and poli&s;hed the times. But as their religion was corrupted by &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o their philo&s;ophy degenerated into &s;ophi&s;try. Nor is it &s;cience alone, even if founded on truth, that will poli&s;h nations.

<P>THE mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornament of the reign of Edward the third, and of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Richard the &s;econd, was Jeffrey Chaucer; a poet with whom the hi&s;tory of our poetry is by many &s;uppo&s;ed to have commenced; and who has been pronounced, by a critic of unque&s;tionable ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, to be the fir&s;t Engli&s;h ver&s;ifier who wrote poetically <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John&s;on's DICTION.

He was born in the year 1328, and educated at Oxford, where he made a rapid progre&s;s in the &s;chola&s;tic &s;ciences as they were then taught: but the liveline&s;s of his parts, and the native gaiety of his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oon recom|mended him to the patronage of a magnificent monarch, and rendered him a very popular and acceptable character in the brilliant court which I have above de&s;cribed. In the mean time, he added to his accompli&s;hments by frequent tours into France and Italy, which he &s;ometimes vi&s;ited under the advantages of a public character. Hitherto our poets had been per&s;ons of a private and circum&s;cribed edu|cation, and the art of ver&s;ifying, like every other kind of compo&s;ition, had been confined to reclu&s;e &s;cholars. But Chaucer was a man of the world: and from this circum|&s;tance we are to account, in great mea&s;ure, for the many new embelli&s;hments which he conferred on our language and our poetry. The de&s;criptions of &s;plendid proce&s;&s;ions and gallant carou&s;als, with which his works abound, are a proof that he was conver&s;ant with the practices and diver&s;ions of polite life.

But this difficulty was &s;oon removed, when I recollected that the Franks, Venetians, and Germans had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that city for more than one hundred years; and that Baldwin earl of Flanders was elected emperor of Con&s;tantinople in the year 1204, and was &s;ucceeded by four Latin or Franki&s;h emperors, down to the year 1261 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">About which period it is probable that the anonymous Greek poem, called the <HI>Loves of Lybi&s;ter and Rhodamna,</HI> was writ|ten.

It will readily be allowed, that the circum&s;tance of the &s;tanzas and rhymes is very &s;ingular in a poem compo&s;ed in the Greek language, and is alone &s;ufficient to prove this piece to be a tran&s;lation from Boccacio. I mu&s;t not forget to ob|&s;erve, that the Greek is extremely barbarous, and of the lowe&s;t period of that language.</P>

I think Statius is copied in a &s;imile, v. 1640. The introduction of this poem is al&s;o taken from the Thebaid, xii. 545. 481. 797. Compare Chaucer's lines, v. 870. &s;eq. v. 917. &s;eq. v. 996. &s;eq. The funeral pyre of Arcite is al&s;o tran&s;lated from Theb. vi. 195. &s;eq. See Ch. v. 2940. &s;eq.

<P>Statius was a favourite writer with the poets of the middle ages. His bloated magnificence of de&s;cription, gi|gantic images, and pompous diction, &s;uited their ta&s;te, and were &s;omewhat of a piece with the romances they &s;o much admired. They neglected the gentler and genuine graces of Virgil, which they could not reli&s;h. His pictures were too correctly and cha&s;tly drawn to take their fancies: and truth of de&s;ign, elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, and the arts of compo|&s;ition,
<PB N="362" REF="529">
were not their objects <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ide</HI> he has tran&s;lated the arguments of the twelve books of the The|baid of Statius.

In the mean time we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in Chaucer's Temple of Mars many per&s;onages are added: and that tho&s;e which exi&s;ted before in Statius have been retouched, enlarged, and rendered more di&s;tinct and pic|ture&s;que by Boccacio and Chaucer. Arcite's addre&s;s to Mars, at entering the temple, has great dignity, and is not copied from Statius.</P>

<P>We are &s;urpri&s;ed to find, in a poet of &s;uch antiquity, numbers &s;o nervous and flowing: a circum&s;tance which greatly contributed to render Dryden's paraphra&s;e of this poem the mo&s;t animated and harmonious piece of ver&s;ifi|cation in the Engli&s;h language. I cannot leave the KNIGHT'S TALE without remarking, that the inventor of this poem, appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable talents for the artificial con&s;truction of a &s;tory. It exhibits unexpected and &s;triking turns of fortune; and abounds in tho&s;e incidents which are calculated to &s;trike the fancy by opening re&s;ources to &s;ublime de&s;cription, or intere&s;t the heart by pathetic &s;itua|tions. On this account, even without con&s;idering the poetical and exterior ornaments of the piece, we are hardly di&s;gu&s;ted with the mixture of manners, the confu&s;ion of times, and the like violations of propriety, which this poem, in common with all others of its age, pre&s;ents in almo&s;t every page. The action is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened &s;oon after the marriage of The&s;eus with Hippolita, and the death of Creon in the &s;iege of Thebes: but we are &s;oon tran&s;ported into more recent periods.

<P>CHAUCER'S ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE is tran&s;lated from a French poem entitled, LE ROMAN DE LA ROSE. It was begun by William of Lorris, a &s;tudent in juri&s;pru|dence, who died about the year 1260 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fauchet, p. 198.</NOTE>. Being left unfini&s;hed, it was completed by John of Meun, a native of a little town of that name, &s;ituated on the river Loire near Orleans, who &s;eems to have flouri&s;hed about the year 1310 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 200. He al&s;o tran&s;lated Boethius <HI>De Con&s;olatione,</HI> and <HI>Abelard's Letters,</HI> and wrote <HI>An&s;wers of the Sybills,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. This poem is e&s;teemed by the French the mo&s;t valuable piece of their old poetry. It is far beyond the rude efforts of all their preceding romancers: and they have nothing equal to it before the reign of Francis the fir&s;t, who died in the year 1547. But there is a con&s;iderable difference in the merit of the two authors. William of Lorris, who wrote not one quarter of the poem, is remarkable for his elegance and luxuriance of de&s;cription, and is a beautiful painter of allegorical per&s;onages. John of Meun is a writer of ano|ther ca&s;t. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but little of his predece&s;&s;or's inven|tive and poetical vein; and in that re&s;pect was not properly qualified to fini&s;h a poem begun by William of Lorris. But he has &s;trong &s;atire, and great liveline&s;s <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The poem con&s;i&s;ts of 22734 ver&s;es. William of Lorris's part ends with v. 4149. viz.</P>
<Q><L>"A peu que je ne m'en de&s;e&s;poir."</L></Q></NOTE>. He was one of the wits of the court of Charles le Bel.</P>
<P>The difficulties and dangers of a lover, in pur&s;uing and obtaining the object of his de&s;ires, are the literal argument of this poem. This de&s;ign is couched under the allegory of
<PB N="369" REF="536">
a Ro&s;e, which our lover after frequent ob&s;tacles gathers in a delicious garden. He traver&s;es va&s;t ditches, &s;cales lofty walls, and forces the gates of adamantine and almo&s;t impregnable ca&s;tles. The&s;e enchanted fortre&s;&s;es are all inhabited by vari|ous divinities; &s;ome of which a&s;&s;i&s;t, and &s;ome oppo&s;e, the lover's progre&s;s <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In the preface of the edition printed in the year 1538, all this allegory is turned to religion. The Ro&s;e is proved to be a &s;tate of grace, or divine wi&s;dom, or eternal beatitude, or the Holy Virgin to which heretics cannot gain acce&s;s. It is the white Ro&s;e of Jericho, <HI>Qua&s;i plantatio Ro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> in Jericho,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. The chemi&s;ts, in the mean time, made it a &s;earch for the Philo|&s;opher's Stone: and other profe&s;&s;ions, with laboured commentaries, explained it into their own re&s;pective &s;ciences.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Chaucer has luckily tran&s;lated all that was written by William of Lorris <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Occleve's <HI>Letter of Cupide,</HI> writ|ten 1402. Urry's <HI>Chaucer,</HI> p. 536. v. 283.

<Q><L>"Vous aurez ab&s;olution."</L></Q>
<P>But Chaucer has made &s;everal omi&s;&s;ions in John of Meun's part, before he comes to this period. He has tran&s;lated all William of Lorris's part, as I have ob&s;erved; and his tran&s;lation of that part ends with v. 4432. viz.</P>
<Q><L>"Than &s;huldin I fallin in wanhope."</L></Q>
<P>Chaucer's cotemporaries called his <HI>Ro|mant of the Ro&s;e,</HI> a tran&s;lation. Lydgate &s;ays that Chaucer</P>

<L>By grete avy&s;e his wittes to di&s;po&s;e,</L>
<L>To <HI>tran&s;late</HI> the ROMANS OF THE ROSE.</L></Q>
<P>Prol. Boch. &s;t. vi. It is manife&s;t that Chaucer took no pains to di&s;gui&s;e his tran&s;lation. He literally follows the French, in &s;aying, that a river was <Q REND="inline">"le&s;&s;e than <HI>Saine.</HI>"</Q> i. e. the Seine at Paris. v. 118. <Q REND="inline">"No wight in all Paris."</Q> v. 7157. A grove has more birds <Q REND="inline">"than ben in all the relme of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> </Q>v. 495. He calls a pine, <Q REND="inline">"A tree in <HI>France</HI> men call a pine."</Q> v. 1457. He &s;ays of ro&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o faire werin nevir in <HI>Rone.</HI>"</Q> v. 1674. <Q REND="inline">"That for Paris ne for Pavie."</Q> v. 1654. He has &s;ometimes reference to French ideas, or words, not in the original. As <Q REND="inline">"Men clepin hem Sereins in France."</Q> v. 684. <Q REND="inline">"From Jeru&s;alem to Burgoine."</Q> v. 554. <Q REND="inline">"Grein de Paris."</Q> v. 1369.

He adds,
<Q><L>For in Loraine there notis be</L>
<L>Full &s;wetir than <HI>in this contre.</HI></L></Q>
There is not a &s;yllable of the&s;e &s;ongs, and &s;ingers, of Loraine, in the French. By the way, I &s;u&s;pect that Chaucer tran&s;lated this poem while he was at Paris. There are al&s;o many allu&s;ions to Engli&s;h affairs, which I &s;u&s;pected to be Chaucer's; but they are all in the French original. Such as, <Q REND="inline">"Hornpipis of Cornevaile."</Q> v. 4250. The&s;e are called in the original, <Q REND="inline">"Chale|meaux de Cornouaille."</Q> v. 3991. A knight is introduced, allied to king <Q REND="inline">"Ar|thour of Bretaigne."</Q> v. 1199. Who is called, <Q REND="inline">"Bon roy Artus de Bretaigne."</Q> Orig. v. 1187. Sir Gawin, and Sir Kay, two of Arthur's knights, are characteri&s;ed, v. 2206. &s;eq. See Orig. v. 2124. Where the word <HI>Keulx</HI> is corrupt for Keie. But there is one pa&s;&s;age, in which he mentions a <HI>Bachelere</HI> as fair as <Q REND="inline">"The Lordis &s;onne of Windi&s;ore."</Q> v. 1250. This is added by Chaucer, and intended as a compliment to &s;ome of his patrons. In the <HI>Legende of good Women,</HI> Cupid &s;ays to Chaucer, v. 329.</P>

<P>Chaucer appears to have been early &s;truck with this French poem. In his DREME, written long before he begun this tran&s;lation, he &s;uppo&s;es, that the chamber in which he &s;lept was richly painted with the &s;tory of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">v. 322. Chaucer alludes to this poem in The MARCHAUNT'S TALE, v. 1548. p. 72. Urr.</NOTE>. It is natural to imagine, that &s;uch a poem mu&s;t have been a favorite with Chaucer. No poet, before William of Lorris, either Italian or French, had delineated allegorical per&s;onages in &s;o di&s;tinct and enlarged a &s;tyle, and with &s;uch a fullne&s;s of characteri&s;tical attributes: nor had de&s;criptive poetry &s;elected &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances, and di&s;clo&s;ed &s;uch an exuberance of embelli&s;hment, in form|ing agreeable repre&s;entations of nature. On this account, we are &s;urpri&s;ed that Boileau &s;hould mention Villon as the fir&s;t poet of France who drew form and order from the chaos of the old French romancers.</P>

<P>But the poetry of William of Lorris was not the poetry of Boileau.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="550">
That this poem &s;hould not plea&s;e Boileau, I can ea&s;ily conceive. It is more &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould have been cen&s;ured as a contemptible performance by Petrarch, who lived in the age of fancy. Petrarch being de&s;ired by his friend Guy de Gonzague to &s;end him &s;ome new piece, &s;ent the ROMAN DE LA ROSE. With the poem, in&s;tead of an encomium, he returned a &s;evere critici&s;m; in which he treats it as a cold, inartificial, and extravagant compo&s;ition: as a proof, how much France, who valued this poem as her chief work, was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by Italy in eloquence and the arts of writing <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Petrarch. Carm. L. i. Ep. 30.</NOTE>. In this opinion we mu&s;t attribute &s;ome|thing to jealou&s;y. But the truth is, Petrarch's genius was too cultivated to reli&s;h the&s;e wild excur&s;ions of imagination: his favorite cla&s;&s;ics, whom he revived, and &s;tudied with &s;o much attention, ran in his head. E&s;pecially Ovid's ART OF LOVE, a poem of another &s;pecies, and evidently formed on another plan; but which Petrarch had been taught to vene|rate, as the model and criterion of a didactic poem on the pa&s;&s;ion of love reduced to a &s;y&s;tem. We may add, that al|though the poem before us was founded on the vi&s;ionary doctrines and refinements concerning love invented by the Provencial poets, and con&s;equently le&s;s unlikely to be fa|vourably received by Petrarch, yet his ideas on that delicate &s;ubject were much more Platonic and metaphy&s;ical.</P>

<P>CHAUCER'S poem of TROILUS and CRESSEIDE is &s;aid to be formed on an old hi&s;tory, written by Lollius, a native of Urbino in Italy <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Petrus Lambeccius enumerates Lollius Urbicus among the <HI>Hi&s;torici Latini profani</HI> of the third century.

Chau|cer places Lollius among the hi&s;torians of Troy, in his Hou&s;e of Fame, iii. 380.

I have never &s;een this hi&s;tory, either in the Lombard or the Latin language. I have before ob&s;erved, that it is mentioned in Boccacio's Decameron, and that a tran&s;lation of it, was made into Greek ver&s;e by &s;ome of the Greek fugitives in the fourteenth century. Du Fre&s;ne, if I mi&s;take not, &s;omewhere mentions it in Italian. In the royal library at Paris it occurs often as an antient French romance.<Q REND="inline"> "Cod. 7546.

<P>The hall was filled with the writers of antient tales and romances, who&s;e &s;ubjects and names were too numerous to be recounted. In the mean time crouds from every nation and of every condition filled the hall, and each pre&s;ented his claim to the queen. A me&s;&s;enger is di&s;patched to &s;ummon Eolus from his cave in Thrace; who is ordered to bring his two clarions called SLANDER and PRAISE, and his trum|peter Triton. The prai&s;es of each petitioner are then re|&s;ounded, according to the partial or capricious appointment of Fame; and equal merits obtain very different &s;ucce&s;s. There is much &s;atire and humour in the&s;e reque&s;ts and re|wards, and in the di&s;graces and honours which are indi&s;|criminately di&s;tributed by the queen, without di&s;cernment and by chance.

<P>Pope has imitated this piece, with his u&s;ual elegance of diction and harmony of ver&s;ification.

Al|though &s;trangers to each other, they are a&s;&s;embled in one room at &s;upper, as was then the cu&s;tom; and agree, not only to travel together the next morning, but to relieve the fatigue of the journey by telling each a &s;tory <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is an inn at Burford in Oxford|&s;hire, which accommodated pilgrims on their road to Saint Edward's &s;hrine in the abbey of Glouce&s;ter.

Their principal and e&s;tabli&s;hed amu&s;ement, in&s;tead of playing at che&s;s after dinner, was for each to tell a tale.

the opportunity of di&s;playing a variety of &s;triking and dra|matic characters, which would not have ea&s;ily met but on &s;uch an expedition.

The Hor&s;e of bra&s;s, on the &s;killful movement and management of certain &s;ecret &s;prings, tran&s;ported his rider into the mo&s;t di&s;tant region of the world in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours; for, as the rider cho&s;e, he could fly in the air with the &s;wiftne&s;s of an eagle: and again, as occa&s;ion required, he could &s;tand mo|tionle&s;s in oppo&s;ition to the &s;tronge&s;t force, vani&s;h on a &s;ud|den at command, and return at his ma&s;ter's call. The Mir|rour of gla&s;s was endued with the power of &s;hewing any future di&s;a&s;ters which might happen to Cambu&s;can's king|dom, and di&s;covered the mo&s;t hidden machinations of trea|&s;on.

<P>I have mentioned, in another place, the favorite philo&s;o|phical &s;tudies of the Arabians <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;. i. ii.</NOTE>. In this poem the nature of tho&s;e &s;tudies is di&s;played, and their operations exemplified: and this con&s;ideration, added to the circum&s;tances of Tar|tary being the &s;cene of action, and Arabia the country from which the&s;e extraordinary pre&s;ents are brought, induces me to believe this &s;tory to be one of the many fables which the Arabians imported into Europe. At lea&s;t it is formed on their principles. Their &s;ciences were tinctured with the warmth of their imaginations; and con&s;i&s;ted in wonderful di&s;coveries and my&s;terious inventions.</P>
<P>This idea of a hor&s;e of bra&s;s took it's ri&s;e from their chemical knowledge and experiments in metals. The trea|ti&s;e of Jeber a famous Arab chemi&s;t of the middle ages, called LAPIS PHILOSOPHORUM, contains many curious and u&s;eful proce&s;&s;es concerning the nature of metals, their fu&s;ion, purification, and malleability, which &s;till maintain a place in modern &s;y&s;tems of that &s;cience <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Arabians call chemi&s;try, as treat|ing of minerals and metals, SIMIA.

<P>Dryden and Pope have moderni&s;ed the two la&s;t mentioned poems. Dryden the tale of the NONNES PRIEST, and Pope that of JANUARY and MAY: intending perhaps to give pat|terns of the be&s;t of Chaucer's Tales in the comic &s;pecies. But I am of opinion that the MILLER'S TALE has more true humour than either. Not that I mean to palliate the levity of the &s;tory, which was mo&s;t probably cho&s;en by Chaucer in compliance with the prevailing manners of an unpoli&s;hed age, and agreeable to ideas of fe&s;tivity not always the mo&s;t delicate and refined. Chaucer abounds in liberties of this kind, and this mu&s;t be his apology. So does Boccacio, and perhaps much more, but from a different cau&s;e. The licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of Boccacio's tales, which he compo&s;ed <HI>per cacciar le malincolia delle femine,</HI> to amu&s;e the ladies, is to be vindicated, at lea&s;t accounted for, on other principles: it was not &s;o much the con&s;equence of popular incivility, as it was owing to a particular event of the writer's age. Ju&s;t before Boc|cacio wrote, the plague at Florence had totally changed the cu&s;toms and manners of the people. Only a few of the
<PB N="424" REF="591">
women had &s;urvived this fatal malady; who having lo&s;t their husbands, parents, or friends, gradually grew regard|le&s;s of tho&s;e con&s;traints and cu&s;tomary formalities which before of cour&s;e influenced their behaviour. For want of female attendants, they were obliged often to take men only into their &s;ervice: and this circum&s;tance greatly con|tributed to de&s;troy their habits of delicacy, and gave an opening to various freedoms and indecencies un&s;uitable to the &s;ex, and frequently productive of very &s;erious con&s;e|quences. As to the mona&s;teries, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that Boccacio &s;hould have made them the &s;cenes of his mo&s;t libertine &s;tories. The plague had thrown open their gates. The monks and nuns wandered abroad, and partaking of the common liberties of life, and the levities of the world, forgot the rigour of their in&s;titutions, and the &s;everity of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical characters. At the cea&s;ing of the plague, when the religious were compelled to return to their cloi&s;ters, they could not for&s;ake their attachment to the&s;e &s;ecular in|dulgences; they continued to practice the &s;ame free cour&s;e of life, and would not &s;ubmit to the di&s;agreeable and un|&s;ocial injunctions of their re&s;pective orders. Cotemporary hi&s;torians give a &s;hocking repre&s;entation of the unbounded debaucheries of the Florentines on this occa&s;ion: and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical writers mention this period as the grand epoch of the relaxation of mona&s;tic di&s;cipline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Boccacio did not e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of the church for the&s;e compo&s;itions. His con|ver&s;ion was a point much laboured; and in expiation of his follies, he was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to renounce poetry and the heathen authors, and to turn Carthu&s;ian. But, to &s;ay the truth, Boccacio's life was almo&s;t as loo&s;e as his writings; till he was in great mea&s;ure reclaimed by the powerful re|mon&s;trances of his ma&s;ter Petrarch, who talked much more to the purpo&s;e than his confe&s;&s;or. This Boccacio him&s;elf acknowledges in the fifth of his eclogues, which like tho&s;e

<P>In the mean time the &s;cholar, intent on accompli&s;hing his intrigue, locks him&s;elf up in his chamber for the &s;pace of two days.

He peeps through a crevice of the door, and at length di&s;covers the &s;cholar, who is con|&s;cious that he was &s;een, in an affected trance of ab&s;tracted meditation. On this our carpenter, reflecting on the danger of being wi&s;e, and exulting in the &s;ecurity of his own ignorance, exclaims,</P>

<P>But the &s;cholar has ample gratification for this ridicule.

He is &s;oon per&s;uaded to believe the prediction: and in the &s;equel, which cannot be repeated here, this humourous contrivance crowns the &s;cho|lar's &s;chemes with &s;ucce&s;s, and proves the cau&s;e of the car|penter's di&s;grace.

<P>I have before hinted, that Chaucer's ob&s;cenity is in great mea&s;ure to be imputed to his age. We are apt to form romantic and exaggerated notions about the moral innocence of our ance&s;tors. Ages of ignorance and &s;implicity are thought to be ages of purity. The direct contrary, I believe, is the ca&s;e. Rude periods have that gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of manners which is not le&s;s friendly to virtue than luxury it&s;elf. In the middle ages, not only the mo&s;t flagrant violations of mode&s;ty were frequently practi&s;ed and permitted, but the mo&s;t infamous vices.

<P>Genuine humour, the concomitant of true ta&s;te, con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;cerning improprieties in books as well as characters. We therefore mu&s;t remark under this cla&s;s another tale of Chaucer, which till lately has been looked upon as a grave heroic narrative. I mean the RIME OF SIR THOPAS. Chau|cer, at a period which almo&s;t reali&s;ed the manners of roman|tic chivalry, di&s;cerned the leading ab&s;urdities of the old romances: and in this poem, which may be ju&s;tly called a prelude to Don Quixote, has burle&s;qued them with exqui&s;ite ridicule. That this was the poet's aim, appears from many pa&s;&s;ages. But, to put the matter beyond a doubt, take the words of an ingenious critic. <Q REND="inline">"We are to ob&s;erve, &s;ays he, that this was Chaucer's own Tale: and that, when in the progre&s;s of it, the good &s;en&s;e of the ho&s;t is made to break in upon him, and interrupt him, Chaucer approves his di&s;gu&s;t, and changing his note, tells the &s;imple in&s;tructive Tale of MELIBOEUS, <HI>a moral tale vertuous,</HI> as he terms it; to &s;hew what &s;ort of fictions were mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of real life, and mo&s;t proper to be put into the hands of the people.

his own, but a &s;tory of antique fame, and very cele|brated in the days of chivalry: &s;o that nothing could better &s;uit the poet's de&s;ign of di&s;crediting the old ro|mances, than the choice of this venerable legend for the vehicle of his ridicule upon them <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Hurd's LETTERS ON CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE.

<P>BUT Chaucer's vein of humour, although con&s;picuous in the CANTERBURY TALES, is chiefly di&s;played in the Characters with which they are introduced. In the&s;e his know|ledge of the world availed him in a peculiar degree, and enabled him to give &s;uch an accurate pic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ure of antient man|ners, as no cotemporary nation has tran&s;mitted to po&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rity. It is here that we view the pur&s;uits and employments, the cu&s;|toms and diver&s;ions, of our ance&s;tors, copied from the life, and repre&s;ented with equal truth and &s;pirit, by a judge of man|kind, who&s;e penetration qualified him to di&s;cern their foibles or di&s;criminating peculiarities; and by an arti&s;t, who un|der&s;tood that proper &s;election of circum&s;tances, and tho&s;e predominant characteri&s;tics, which form a fini&s;hed portrait. We are &s;urpri&s;ed to find, in &s;o gro&s;s and ignorant an age, &s;uch talents for &s;atire, and for ob&s;ervation on lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; qualities which u&s;ually exert them&s;elves at more civili&s;ed periods, when the improved &s;tate of &s;ociety, by &s;ubtili&s;ing our &s;peculations, and e&s;tabli&s;hing uniform modes of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ha|viour, di&s;po&s;es mankind to &s;tudy them&s;elves, and renders deviations of conduct, and &s;ingularities of character, more immediately and nece&s;&s;arily the obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cts of cen&s;ure and ridi|cule.

<P>The following anecdotes and ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rvations may &s;erve to throw general light on the learning of the authors who com|po&s;e this curious library. The Ari&s;totelic or Arabian philo|&s;ophy continued to be communicated from Spain and Africa to the re&s;t of Europe chie&s;ly by means of the Jews: parti|cularly to France and Italy, which were over-run with Jews about the tenth and eleventh centuries. About the&s;e p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">riods, not only the courts of the Mahometan princes, but even that of the pope him&s;elf, were filled with Jews.

phy&s;ic; an art then but imperfectly known and practiced in mo&s;t parts of Europe. Being well ver&s;ed in the Arabic tongue, from their commerce with Africa and Egypt, they had &s;tudied the Arabic tran&s;lations of Galen and Hippo|crates; which had become &s;till more familiar to the great numbers of their brethren who re&s;ided in Spain. From this &s;ource al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Jews learned philo&s;ophy; and Hebrew ver&s;ions made about this period from the Arabic, of Ari&s;totle and the Greek phy&s;icians and mathematicians, are &s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> extant in &s;ome libraries <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb.

One of the mo&s;t eminent of the&s;e learned Jews was Mo&s;es Maimonides, a phy&s;ician, philo&s;opher, a&s;trologer, and theologi&s;t, educated at Cordoua in Spain under Averroes. He died about the year 1208. Averroes being accu&s;ed of heretical opinions, was &s;entenced to <HI>live with the Jews in the &s;treet of the Jews</HI> at Cordoua. Some of the&s;e learned Jews began to flouri&s;h in the Arabian &s;chools in Spain, as early as the beginning of the ninth century. Many of the treati&s;es of Averroes were tran&s;lated by the Spani&s;h Jews into He|brew: and the Latin pieces of Averroes now extant were tran&s;lated into Latin from the&s;e Hebrew ver&s;ions. I have already mentioned the &s;chool or univer&s;ity of Cordoua.

<P>Chaucer's &s;cheme of the CANTERBURY TALES was evidently left unfini&s;hed. It was intended by our author, that every pilgrim &s;hould likewi&s;e tell a Tale on their return from Can|terbury <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Or rather, two on their way thither, and two on their return. Only Chaucer him&s;elf tells two tales. The poet &s;ays, that there were twenty-nine pilgrims in company: but in the CHARACTERS he de&s;cribes more. Among the TALES which remain, there are none of the Priore&s;&s;e's Chaplains, the Haberda&s;her, Carpynter, Webbe, Dyer, Tapicer, and Ho&s;te. The Chanon Yeman has a TALE, but no CHA|RACTER.

to this deficiency, and with this view to have written a Tale called the MARCHAUNT'S SECOND TALE, or the HISTORY OF BERYN. It was fir&s;t printed by Urry, who &s;uppo&s;ed it to be Chaucer's <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Urr. Chauc. p. 595.</NOTE>. In the Prologue which is of con&s;iderable length, there is &s;ome humour and contrivance: in which the author, happily enough, continues to charac|teri&s;e the pilgrims, by imagining what each did, and how each behaved, when they all arrived at Canterbury. After dinner was ordered at their inn, they all proceed to the cathedral. At entering the church one of the monks &s;prinkles them with holy water. The Knight with the better &s;ort of the company goes in great order to the &s;hrine of Thomas a Beckett. The Miller and his companions run &s;taring about the church: they pretend to blazon the arms painted in the gla&s;s windows, and enter into a di&s;pute in heraldry: but the Ho&s;te of the Tabarde reproves them for their improper beha|viour and impertinent di&s;cour&s;e, and directs them to the martyr's &s;hrine. When all had fini&s;hed their devotions, they return to the inn. In the way thither they purcha&s;e toys for which that city was famous, called <HI>Canterbury brochis:</HI> and here much facetiou&s;ne&s;s pa&s;&s;es betwixt the Frere and the Sompnour, in which the latter vows revenge on the former, for telling a Tale &s;o palpably levelled at his profe&s;&s;ion, and prote&s;ts he will retaliate on their return by a more &s;evere &s;tory. When dinner is ended, the Ho&s;te of the Tabarde thanks all the company in form for their &s;everal Tales. The party then &s;eparate till &s;upper-time by agreement. The Knight goes to &s;urvey the walls and bulwarks of the city, and explains to his &s;on the Squier the nature and &s;trength of them. Mention is here made of great guns. The Wife of Bath is too weary to walk far; &s;he propo&s;es to the Priore&s;&s;e to divert them&s;elves in the garden, which abounds with herbs proper for making &s;alves. Others wander about the &s;treets. The Pardoner has a low adventure, which ends

The next morning they proceed on their return to Southwark: and our genial ma&s;ter of the Tabarde, ju&s;t as they leave Canterbury, by way of putting the company into good humour, begins a panegyric on the morning and the month of April, &s;ome lines of which I &s;hall quote, as a &s;pecimen of our author's abilities in poetical de&s;cription <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">There is a good de&s;cription of a magical palace, v. 1973&mdash;2076.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IT is not my intention to dedicate a volume to Chaucer, how much &s;oever he may de&s;erve it; nor can it be ex|pected, that, in a work of this general nature, I &s;hould enter into a critical examination of all Chaucer's pieces. Enough has been &s;aid to prove, that in elevation, and elegance, in har|mony and per&s;picuity of ver&s;ification, he &s;urpa&s;&s;es his predece&s;|&s;ors in an infinite proportion: that his genius was univer&s;al, and adapted to themes of unbounded variety: that his merit was not le&s;s in painting familiar manners with humour and propriety, than in moving the pa&s;&s;ions, and in repre&s;enting the beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and &s;ub|limity. In a word, that he appeared with all the lu&s;tre and dignity of a true poet, in an age which compelled him to &s;truggle with a barbarous language, and a national want of ta&s;te; and when to write ver&s;es at all, was regarded as a &s;ingular qualification. It is true indeed, that he lived at a time when the French and Italians had made con&s;iderable advances and improvements in poetry: and although proofs have already been occa&s;ionally given of his imitations from the&s;e &s;ources, I &s;hall clo&s;e my account of him with a di&s;tinct and comprehen&s;ive view of the nature of the poetry which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in France and Italy when he wrote: pointing out in the mean time, how far and in what manner the po|pular models of tho&s;e nations contributed to form his ta&s;te, and influence his genius.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the troubadours of Provence, and have ob&s;erved that they were fond of moral and alle|gorical fables <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. p. 148.</NOTE>. A ta&s;te for this &s;ort of compo&s;ition they

partly acquired by reading Boethius, and the PSYCHOMACHIA of Prudentius, two favorite cla&s;&s;ics of the dark ages; and partly from the Saracens their neighbours in Spain, who were great inventors of apologues. The French have a very early metrical romance DE FORTUNE ET DE FELICITE, a tran&s;lation from Boethius's book DE CONSOLATIONE, by Reynault de Louens a Dominican friar <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Mem. Lit. tom. xviii. p. 74<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. 4^t^o. And tom. vii. 293. 294. I have before mentioned John of Meun's tran&s;lation of Boethius. It is in ver&s;e. John de Langres is &s;aid to have made a tran&s;lation in pro&s;e, about 1336. It is highly probable that Chaucer tran&s;lated Boethius from &s;ome of the French tran&s;lations. In the Bodleian library there is an EXPLANATIO of Boe|thius's CONSOLATION by our countryman Nicholas Trivett, who died before 1329.</NOTE>. From this &s;ource, among many others of the Provencial poems, came the Tour|nament of ANTICHRIST above-mentioned, which contains a combat of the Virtues and Vices <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. p. 285.</NOTE>: the Romaunt of Richard de Li&s;le, in which MODESTY fighting with LUST<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">PUTERIE.

Vi&s;ions were a branch of this &s;pecies of poetry, which admitted the mo&s;t licentious excur|&s;ions of fancy in forming per&s;onifications, and in feigning imaginary b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ings and ideal habitations.

<P>But the principal &s;ubject of their poems, dictated in great mea&s;ure by the &s;pirit of chivalry, was love: e&s;pecially among the troubadours of rank and di&s;tinction, who&s;e ca&s;tles being crowded with ladies, pre&s;ented perpetual &s;cenes of the mo&s;t &s;plendid gallantry. This pa&s;&s;ion they &s;pirituali&s;ed into various metaphy&s;ical refinements, and filled it with ab&s;tracted notions of vi&s;ionary perfection and felicity.

<P>But above all, Chaucer's FLOURE AND THE LEAFE, in which an air of rural de&s;cription predominates, and where the allegory is principally conducted by my&s;terious allu&s;ions to the virtues or beauties of the vegetable world, to flowers and plants, exclu&s;ive of its general romantic and allegoric vein,

The French and Italian poets, whom Chaucer imitates, abound in allegorical per&s;onages: and it is remarkable, that the early poets of Greece and Rome were fond of the&s;e creations. Homer has given us, STRIFE, CONTENT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ON, FEAR, TERROR, TUMULT, DESIRE, PERSUASION, and BENEVOLENCE. We have in He&s;iod, DARKNESS, and many others, if the Shield of Hercules be of his hand.

The fragments of Ennius indicate, that his poetry con&s;i&s;ted much of per&s;oni|fications. He &s;ays, that in one of the Carthaginian wars, the gigantic image of SORROW appeared in every place: <Q REND="inline">"Omnibus endo locis ingens apparet imago TRISTITIAS."</Q> Lucretius has drawn the great and terrible figure of SU|PERSTITION, <Q REND="inline">"Quae caput e coeli regionibus o&s;tende|bat."</Q> He al&s;o mentions, in a beautiful proce&s;&s;ion of the Sea&s;ons, CALOR ARIDUS, HYEMS, and ALGUS.

It &s;eems to have e&s;caped the many critics who have written on Milton's noble but romantic alle|gory of SIN and DEATH, that he took the per&s;on of Death from the Alce&s;tis of his favorite tragedian Euripides, where &THgr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Sgr; is a principal agent in the drama.

<P>AN INDEX TO THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY By THOMAS WARTON, B. D. FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD, AND OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES, AND LATE PROFESSOR OF POETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Index to WARTON'S HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY, which is here presented to the world, was not originally intended for pub|lication. The great inconvenience arising from the want of its assistance, must have been severely felt by all who have, in the course of their literary pursuits, had occasion to refer to this noble treasure of poetical knowledge. To obviate the disadvantage, as it related exclusively to himself, the compiler, at a period of leisure, drew out the present Index. The experience of its utility suggested the idea of multiplying the copies, by which it is trusted that a commendable service has been rendered to literature. Though none can with reason think these pages wholly useless, some may not find it needful to their studies to possess them; therefore, it has been thought fit to suffer the impression of them to fall far short of that of the History. It does not exceed one-fourth of the number.</P>
<P>Whether an entire Index of the three volumes together would not have been a plan more desirable than that which has been pursued, is a question not now to be examined. It has been considered, and this is the reply: The HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY is an un|finished work. The learned and elegant historian was "gathered to his fathers" almost in the midst of his instructive and entertaining labours. Much yet remains to be done; and as it is the reverse of improbable that some other foot (we <HI>faintly</HI> hope, <HI>"passibus aequis,")</HI> will traverse the ground, which he has left untrodden, it cannot be denied, that with regard to uniformity, a separate table to each volume was the preferable mode to adopt.</P>
<P>If an Index be copious and correct, it possesses the first qualities belonging to the nature of such an undertaking. This merit, as far as human diligence could succeed, the compiler claims, with, in his opinion, the no mean praise of having been useful.</P>
