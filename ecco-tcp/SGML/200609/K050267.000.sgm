<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS almo&s;t every thing in this
critici&s;ing Age is liable to be
cavil'd at and di&s;puted, &s;o
contrary to the Rules of
Charity and good Humour, it is the
avow'd Temper, or at lea&s;t the Practice
of the Age, where any thing &s;o di&s;puted
is liable to a double or differing Con|&s;truction,
always to take it in the
wor&s;t.</P>
<P>To prevent this, and anticipate the
Cavils of tho&s;e who would &s;ugge&s;t E|vil
where no Evil ought to be &s;ugge&s;ted,
a &s;hort Preface is thought needful to
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
this Work, tho otherwi&s;e plain enough,
to prepare the Reader to be at lea&s;t ho|ne&s;t
and ju&s;t, if he &s;hould not incline to
be candid and generous, in his looking
over the following Sheets.</P>
<P>Here's no Apology to be made for Vice,
no extenuating of Crimes, no Harangues
for Drunkenne&s;s; when, at the &s;ame
time, the Liquors, which it has been
&s;ugge&s;ted are in&s;trumental to our Immo|ralitys,
are, as the Reader may think,
&s;poken favourably of.</P>
<P>But we are &s;tating the Ca&s;e of the
Di&s;tilling Bu&s;ine&s;s as a Commerce, and
of the Di&s;tillers as a Society improving
that Commerce, for the Good of their
Country; enquiring whether they are a
publick Good, and Encouragers of the
Trade yea or no: if they are, the Par|liament
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> now &s;itting will
judge whether it is meet to encourage
them or not; and if not, <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">
But it &s;eems needful to hint, and this
is the Rea&s;on of this Preface, That the
Que&s;tion does not &s;eem to lie here, Whe|ther
the Spirits &s;hall be di&s;till'd and con|&s;um'd
among us, and whether the Poor
&s;hall drink them? But, Whether the
<HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hall &s;urni&s;h us with them, and
cheat and impo&s;e upon us, as well pub|lickly
as privately, in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and
mo&s;t barefac'd manner? or whether our
own Manufacture &s;hall &s;upply us, our
own Growth be con&s;um'd, and our own
People employ'd?</P>
<P>The&s;e are indeed very &s;hort Que&s;ti|ons,
and I think few Words will decide
them: If the fir&s;t be encourag'd, and
Fraud and clande&s;tine Trade be continu|ed,
for want of due Regulations, and
proper Mea&s;ures taken to prevent it,
I &s;hall only &s;ay it &s;hall not be for want
of due Information. But if our own
Manufacture, the Labour and In|du&s;try
of our own People, and the Con|&s;umption
of our own Growth be encou|rag'd,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
as we cannot doubt they will, I
take the Liberty to &s;ay, the Di&s;tilling-Trade
in <HI>England,</HI> which is already &s;o
much improv'd and encreas'd, will in a
very few Years conquer all foreign Im|portations,
all the clande&s;tine and cor|rupt
Management of other Countries,
who impo&s;e upon us, and even the
&s;muggling and running of <HI>French</HI> Bran|dy
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ignorance that occa&s;ions mo&s;t
of the Prejudice at the Di&s;tilling Trade
among us, oblig'd me to enter into the
Detail of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Operations with
their Malt Spirits; and the fir&s;t In|troduction
of <HI>Geneva</HI> among the common
People, which otherwi&s;e &s;ome might
pretend is u&s;ele&s;s in the Ca&s;e before us.
But 'tis needful we &s;hould know Things
in their Original, and be able to &s;ee
from what Fountain every Mi&s;chief
flows, that we may not lay the Weight
where it ought not to lie.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
The <HI>Dutch</HI> were doubtle&s;s look'd up|on
as great Benefactors to our Com|merce,
and who by taking off yearly &s;o
great a Quantity of our Corn, were &s;o
great an Advantage to our Landed In|tere&s;t,
our Navigation, and our Poor;
and while the Product, let it be what
it will, was con&s;um'd abroad, and their
Geneva and other Spirits reach'd no
farther than their Camps and Fleets
(and withal while they did not cheat us
in the Draw-backs too, if ever that time
was) they were really &s;o.</P>
<P>But here you will &s;ee that it is po&s;&s;ible,
in the general turn of things, and the
Changes which matters of Trade, in com|mon
with the re&s;t of human Affairs, are
&s;ubject to, what is a publick Good to day,
may be a publick Grievance to morrow;
and what a Law is made to encourage
at one time, may require a Law to pro|hibit
and prevent at another: And
this is the true Ca&s;e of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Di&s;|tilling
Trade, as it &s;hocks with, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
this time interferes with our own, as
will be &s;een from <HI>p.</HI> 24 to 36. of this
Work, in which an Account of that Part
is given.</P>
<P>Time, and a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;well'd
al&s;o beyond expectation in other needful
parts, prevents entring further into
the&s;e things at pre&s;ent; but by this may
be &s;een the great Difficultys this valua|ble
Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;tillery
has &s;truggled with, and the great and
ju&s;t Arguments for its farther Encou|ragement.
All which is humbly &s;ub|mitted
to the Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of the

<HEAD>A BRIEF
STATE
OF THE
CASE
OF THE
DISTILLERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;tilling of Spirits, is indeed an
antient Art; and the Di&s;tillers Com|pany
is antient, having been incor|porated
in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI>
But as the Nature of their Bu&s;ine&s;s is quite
chang'd, that they work in a new Method,
and from new Materials, are under new Limi|tations,
and their Intere&s;t and Trade &s;tand in a
new and quite different Situation from what
was the Ca&s;e formerly; &s;o it may be &s;aid,
their very Con&s;titution is modern, and they
are young in the Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">
But however young the Trade may be, and
that the Materials they work from are diffe|rent
from what they formerly made u&s;e of,
it is apparent, that they are infinitely more a
publick Benefit to the Nation, than they were
before; and that the Di&s;tilling Trade, con&s;i|dered
in its pre&s;ent Magnitude, is one of the
greate&s;t Improvements, and the mo&s;t to the
Advantage of the Publick, of any Bu&s;ine&s;s
now carried on in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In former Times, the Di&s;tillers, like other
incorporated Arts and My&s;terys, work'd whol|ly
for them&s;elves and for their own Profit:
now they, without a <HI>Pun,</HI> may be truly &s;aid to
be <HI>publick &s;pirited People;</HI> for they work for
the whole Body, and that immediately and
in a particular manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. They work for the Gentlemen or Land|ed
Intere&s;t, in con&s;uming the Produce of their
Soil, and encouraging Tillage and Husbandry.</P>
<P N="2">2. They work for the Tenant and Farmer,
in helping them off with their Corn, and
particularly in finding them a Market for tho&s;e
Grains of the meane&s;t Quality, and which it
would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible for them
to di&s;po&s;e of to Advantage any other way.</P>
<P N="3">3. They work for the Navigation of the
Kingdom; abundance of Shipping and other
Ve&s;&s;els, being daily and con&s;tantly, and &s;ome
wholly employ'd, in bringing the Corn and
Coal which is con&s;um'd by the Di&s;tillers Trade,
up to <HI>London,</HI> from the remote&s;t Parts of the
Kingdom.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="3" REF="11">
4. They work for the Poor; many Thou|&s;ands
of Familys being nece&s;&s;arily employ'd as
well in the Husbandry of the Corn they u&s;e,
as in the Malting it, then in carrying and re|moving
it to and from the Malting-Places, to
the Ports for &s;hipping it to <HI>London,</HI> or other|wi&s;e
to <HI>London</HI> directly by Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. But above all this, they work for the
Publick in the extraordinary Sums of Money,
which they pay to the Crown, as well in the
Exci&s;e upon the Spirits they extract, as in
the Duty upon the Malt paid before it comes
to their Hands, and in the Tax upon Coals.</P>
<P>To explain the&s;e Particulars a little farther,
tho as briefly as we can, let it be con&s;ider'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. The landed Gentlemen mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible
the Di&s;tillers work for them, &s;ince the Di&s;til|ling
Trade in and about <HI>London</HI> only, con|&s;umes
about 200000 Quarters of Corn, and
that Corn nece&s;&s;arily employs 100000 Acres
of Land for the Produce of it; for this kind of
Corn being generally the Product of the re|mote
Countys, where the Lands are not rich,
we may venture to &s;ay, two Quarters upon
an Acre one with another, is no mean Crop,
and is &s;ufficient to make a due Calculation
upon.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Hor&s;es employ'd in the Hu&s;|bandry
of 100000 Acres of Land every Year,
and in the Carriage of this Corn to the Mal|&s;ters,
and the Re-carriage of the Malt either to
the Market, or to the Port where it is to be
&s;hipp'd, tho no gue&s;s can be made at their
<PB N="4" REF="12">
Number; yet this may with Mode&s;ty be al|lowed,
that tho&s;e Cattle being very many,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;ume the Growth and Pro|duce
of many Thou&s;ands of Acres of Land
more.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that if tho&s;e Lands
did not produce this Corn, they would pro|duce
&s;omething el&s;e; or that if the Di&s;tillers
did not take off and con&s;ume this Corn, &s;ome|body
el&s;e would; &s;eeing it is evident, <HI>England</HI>
being now become what they properly call
a Corn Country, produces much more Corn
than it can con&s;ume: And if that Con&s;umption
&s;hould be le&s;&s;en'd, many of tho&s;e Lands mu&s;t
lie uncultivated, as it is manife&s;t many Thou|&s;ands
of Acres did before. It is al&s;o a receiv'd
Maxim, that every Quarter of Corn which is
carried off, and con&s;um'd more than was con|&s;um'd
before, (no Scarcity being occa&s;ioned at
Home) is &s;o much clear Gain to the publick
Stock of the Nation.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that the Liquor di&s;till'd is
con&s;umed at Home, and &s;o is not equally be|neficial
to the publick Stock, as what is ex|ported;
'tis an&s;wered, (1.) But much of it is
al&s;o exported, and more would be, if Encou|ragement
were given. (2.) That mo&s;t of what
is con&s;umed at Home, is us'd in the &s;tead and
room of French and Foreign Brandys and
Spirits, which are generally bought abroad with
ready Money, and &s;muggl'd on Shore to the
Ruin of the fair Trader, and le&s;&s;ening the Re|venue
by a con&s;tant abcminable Fraud, and
<PB N="5" REF="13">
which it appears no Laws yet made, have been
&s;ufficient to prevent.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Tenant or Farmer is particularly
work'd for, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Di&s;tilling
Trade, and that in &s;everal re&s;pects; as the
Di&s;tillers not only take off a great Quantity
of their Corn, but al&s;o take off tho&s;e Kinds
which are not marketable for other U&s;es: As,
particularly, (1.) When thro' long Drought the
Grain appears thin and light, as is often the
Ca&s;e; or by un&s;ea&s;onable Rains in Harve&s;t the
Farmers cannot get their Corn well in; or when
by that or other Di&s;a&s;ters and Accidents it is
damaged, either in the <HI>Field,</HI> or in the <HI>Barn,</HI>
in the <HI>Ear,</HI> or in the <HI>Sack;</HI> in all which Ca|&s;es
the Farmer is put to great Difficulty to di&s;|po&s;e
of it, and were it not for the Di&s;tilling|Trade
could do little with it but feed his Hogs,
which would not enable him to pay his Rent.
(2.) The Farmers have oftentimes Lands which
not only will not bear any other Corn, but
that for want of Manure and Improvement.
(which in &s;ome Places is hard to be had) of
thro' the Sterility and Poverty of the Soil, are
unable to produce either better Corn, or a bet|ter
and fuller Grain of the Kind; and which
Lands, if they could not employ them thus,
mu&s;t lie wa&s;te and untill'd, but are profitably
cultivated by the Vent which they find for that
meaner Kind of Grain to the Di&s;tillers. This
is vi&s;ible in the Northern and Ea&s;tern Countys
and Coa&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> where a very great
Quantity of poor and unimproveable Lands,
<PB N="6" REF="14">
which formerly lay wa&s;te, are now plow'd and
&s;ow'd, to the Advantage of the poor Tenants,
tho much more of the Landlord.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Encouragement given to Navigation
by the Di&s;tilling-Trade in <HI>England,</HI> is vi&s;ible
in many Branches of it: For the Corn and the
Coals which they con&s;ume, being a bulky and
heavy Carriage, and not to be ea&s;ily brought
far by Land, the Number of Coa&s;ting Ships and
Ve&s;&s;els of all Kinds are vi&s;ibly encreas'd &s;ince
the Encrea&s;e of this Trade, and con&s;equently
the Number of Seamen employ'd are encreas'd;
the Advantage of which is &s;o well known, it
needs not be enlarg'd on: The Coa&s;ting-Navi|gation
al&s;o being the greate&s;t and be&s;t Nur&s;ery
of able Seamen in the whole Nation.</P>
<P>To the Encrea&s;e of the Number of Ships
and Ve&s;&s;els thus employ'd, might be added
here, the Addition which that Encrea&s;e is to
all the numerous Trades, both Foreign and
Home-Trades, and to the Employment of
Hands, and Encrea&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which ne|ce&s;&s;arily
attends the building, fitting out, fur|ni&s;hing,
and victualling all tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els. But
I forbear to run it out to its full Length, con|tenting
my &s;elf to repre&s;ent that this Trade is
a great Addition to the Marine Intere&s;t, and
an Encrea&s;e and Encouragement of all its De|pendencys.</P>
<P>That
they work for the Poor is evident by
their &s;etting the Poor to work, which indeed
is the be&s;t way of working for them. The
Number of Hands employ'd, or who&s;e Em|ployments
are bettered and encrea&s;ed by this
<PB N="7" REF="15">
Trade, would take up a Volume by it &s;elf to
calculate and ca&s;t it up. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay,
that as all Encrea&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s is an Encrea&s;e
of Employment for the Poor, &s;o all Encrea&s;e
of Employment for the Poor is an Encrea&s;e of
the publick Stock; as it enables tho&s;e People
to gain their Bread, who were not able to do
it, or not &s;o well able, before. And this again
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the landed Intere&s;t too, in abating the
heavy Rates of the Pari&s;h-Poor, and enabling
&s;everal thou&s;ands of poor People to &s;upport
them&s;elves and Familys, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e
be left upon the Pari&s;hes to maintain.</P>
<P>This runs thro' all the &s;everal Branches of
Bu&s;ine&s;s and People, thro' who&s;e Hands the &s;aid
Manufactures pa&s;s, as well the Di&s;tilling Part it
&s;elf, as the Materials made u&s;e of for the Pro|duction,
as Corn and Coals, and the Shipping
and other Carriages already mentioned; as al|&s;o
the va&s;t expen&s;ive Works of the Di&s;tillers
them&s;elves, the Copper and Iron-Work they
make u&s;e of, the Ve&s;&s;els and large Uten&s;ils,
and the Number of Hands employ'd, and the
exceeding Charge daily expended by them in
all the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>But we wave the multiplying Particulars, and
come to the la&s;t Article, namely, the great Be|nefit
to the Publick, ari&s;ing by the Dutys with
which this Trade is loaded, and which have
now for many Years encrea&s;ed the Funds upon
which the Publick Credit has been &s;o long up|upheld;
and the&s;e are con&s;iderable in three
Branches.<LIST>
<PB N="8" REF="16">
<ITEM>1. The &s;everal Exci&s;es upon the Spirits
them&s;elves, laid in &s;everal Branches and at &s;eve|ral
Times, and which amount in the whole to
above a hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Duty upon Malt, which is paid by
the Di&s;tillers in the Price of the Goods, when
they buy, and which amounts to a very great
Sum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Duty upon Coals, of which the
Di&s;tillers con&s;ume, by Calculation, above twen|ty
thou&s;and Chaldrons a Year.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Advantages of this Trade being thus
con&s;ider'd, it occurs in the next Place, to &s;hew,
(1.) That this Trade is yet improving, that
it is a growing Trade, and that if not di&s;cou|raged
by unrea&s;onable Hard&s;hips and Impo&s;i|tions,
it is likely to encrea&s;e in an extraordi|nary
manner. And, (2.) That this Encrea&s;e
is likely to be obtain'd, not by an Encrea&s;e of
Exce&s;&s;es and Immoralities, but by changing the
Gu&s;t of the People, from drinking tho&s;e other
Spirits and Brandys, which being manufactu|red,
corrupted, and adulterated abroad, are
not only imported, as well clande&s;tinely as
otherwi&s;e, to the great Injury of the Health of
our People, but being bought by our ready
Money, are a great Di&s;advantage to our Com|merce,
and Injury to the Revenue.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Di&s;tilling Trade is a &s;till improv|ing
and growing Bu&s;ine&s;s; and it is worth con|&s;idering
to what a Height, and on what a ju&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="17">
Foundation it is likely to improve; for if it be
already, even while it is not much above twen|ty
Years old, in its pre&s;ent Magnitude, &s;o ad|vanced,
as has been already &s;aid, as to pay &s;o
great a Revenue to the Crown, and employ
&s;uch a prodigious Number of Acres of Land,
be&s;ides Ships, Cattle and Men, what may it
not do, when by the Improvement of the Art,
and the granting &s;uch Regulations by which
it would flouri&s;h, it &s;hall from the mere Good|ne&s;s
of the Goods that &s;hall be produc'd, en|tirely
&s;uppre&s;s the Importation of Foreign Mix|tures,
and even of French Brandy it&s;elf; the
Spirit di&s;till'd from Corn in <HI>England,</HI> prevail|ing
over them all by the Force of its own Me|rit?</P>
<P>Nor
is this Que&s;tion unworthy the Con&s;i|deration
of the Crown it &s;elf; whether the
Encouraging the Di&s;tilling Trade, is not really
a better and more effectual way to rai&s;e a Re|venue
by it, than loading it with new Taxes,
which can have no other Effect than to le&s;&s;en
the Con&s;umption, and bring a ri&s;ing Manufac|ture
under a Decay.</P>
<P>It is evident, that as well by the Dearne&s;s of
French Brandy, and the Corruption and Fraud of
the Dutch Importation, as by the improv'd and
&s;till advancing Goodne&s;s of the Engli&s;h Malt
Spirit, which I &s;hall make appear is coming
fairly up to be equal to the be&s;t French Brandy;
the great and opiniated Gu&s;t of the People to
French and Foreign Brandy, is already much
abated, and the Con&s;umption of our own Pro|duct
<PB N="10" REF="18">
gains Ground on them every Day, to
the great Advantage of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>As the Con&s;umption encrea&s;es, the publick
Revenue encrea&s;es of cour&s;e, without the
Addition of new Taxes, with this undeniable
Difference to the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI>
namely, That this way as the Revenue en|crea&s;es,
all the fore-mentioned Advantages
will encrea&s;e: The Quantity of Lands to be
cultivated, will encrea&s;e: The Advantage to
the Farmer, the Employment of Cattle, Ships
and Men, will all encrea&s;e with it&punc; where|as
by burdening the Trade with new Dutys,
it cannot be pretended the Con&s;umption will
encre&s;e, tho the Duty &s;hould; on the con|trary,
if it &s;hould decrea&s;e, as is mo&s;t natural,
the Dearne&s;s of all Goods le&s;&s;ening the Con|&s;umption,
then all tho&s;e national Advantages
above mu&s;t decrea&s;e in proportion.</P>
<P>As to the weak Pretences of the Malt Spi|rits
being de&s;tructive to the Health of the Peo|ple,
they &s;eem only fit to be je&s;ted with, as they
have been: and I mu&s;t &s;ay, I am &s;orry to &s;ee
&s;ome Magi&s;terial People have expos'd their
Weakne&s;s in this Point &s;o much.</P>
<P>They have no where &s;hew'd the World a
Rea&s;on why as good and whole&s;om a Spirit may
not be drawn from the Corn, (who&s;e mere De|coction
in other Preparations is allow'd to be
&s;o good) as from any other Materials; and if, as
the Learned &s;ay, the Spirit only is the nutritive
Part of all our Food, whether Meat or Drink,
<PB N="11" REF="19">
there can then be no que&s;tion, but that a Spirit
carefully extracted from the gro&s;s and humid
Parts, and faithfully prepared without any A|dulterations
or corrupt Mixtures, mu&s;t be as
whole&s;om to the Body, as the &s;ame Spirit un|extracted
and mix'd with the common Liquids
by Infu&s;ion and Ebullition; or as any Spirit ex|tracted
from other Principles of any kind what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>As
for the Exce&s;&s;es and Intemperances of
the People, and their drinking immoderate
Quantitys of Malt Spirits, the Di&s;tillers are
not concern'd in it at all; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to
prepare a Spirit whole&s;om and good. If the
People will de&s;troy them&s;elves by their own
Exce&s;&s;es, and make that Poi&s;on, which is o|therwi&s;e
an Antidote; 'tis the Magi&s;trate's Bu|&s;ine&s;s
to help that, not the Di&s;tillers. 'Tis
humbly conceiv'd al&s;o, they would do the
&s;ame with Foreign Brandy and Spirits, if there
was no di&s;tilling at Home in the whole Na|tion.</P>
<P>It
is in the next place, humbly offered to
the Publick to con&s;ider, what a Trade, and
how ruinous to the Nation in &s;everal con&s;i|derable
Articles, the Di&s;tilling Trade in <HI>England</HI>
is now oppo&s;ed to; and how nece&s;&s;ary it is to
have that pernicious Commerce, if po&s;&s;ible,
&s;uppre&s;s'd. And this Part is the more u&s;eful,
becau&s;e it &s;eems very few, even of our mo&s;t
penetrating Gentlemen, are fully Ma&s;ters of
it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20">
Were the Foreign Importation of Spirits
confin'd only to that Species we call French,
which it is generally allow'd is a whole&s;om
and well extracted Spirit; yet as the French
Brandys are a Product infinitely injurious to
our Commerce, bought from a Nation with
whom we having no Treaty of Commerce,
cannot exchange our Manufactures, but mu&s;t
pay for them in Specie, to the evident turning the
Ballance of Trade again&s;t us: In this re&s;pect
they are injurious to the Health of the Publick,
if not to the Health of particular Bodys; and
con&s;equently 'tis a publick Good to di&s;courage
them, and abate their Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But when we come to &s;peak of the Foreign
Spirits, (however fal&s;ly call'd Brandys) it is e|vident
there the Ca&s;e differs extremely, and we
are &s;o great Sufferers in that Part, as well in
re&s;pect to the Health of the Body as the Pro&s;|perity
of Commerce, and the Frauds put upon
the Crown to the great Lo&s;s of the Revenue;
that as it is a publick Good in our Di&s;tilling
Trade, that we gain upon and le&s;&s;en that
Trade, &s;o it mu&s;t be &s;ome Service to expo&s;e
the Abu&s;es of it, and let our People &s;ee how
gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ly they are impos'd upon in it, both in
the publick and private Intere&s;t of our Coun|try</P>
<P>To
&s;et this dark Commerce in a clear Light,
'tis needful to take notice, by what unhappy
Artifice the &s;ubtle Dutch Traders are enabled,
our own Weakne&s;s concurring, not only to un|derwork
us, but to impo&s;e upon us, and &s;ell
<PB N="13" REF="21">
us Spirits di&s;till'd from our own Materials,
cheaper than we can make them at Home;
tho as it happens, their Avarice, &s;o natural to
their Climate, will not &s;uffer them to make
them &s;o good.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, we are to &s;uppo&s;e they have the
Malt from <HI>England,</HI> as generally they have
from <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>The Fraud begins at the very Beginning; for
the <HI>Dutch</HI> approving to have their Malt far
grown on the Floor, and without dre&s;&s;ing and
skreening off the Tails, as we call them; the
Mal&s;ter lets it run in &s;uch manner, that 20
Quarter of Barley &s;hall mea&s;ure out 40 Quar|ter
of Malt: I &s;peak within Compa&s;s, for it
has been known to mea&s;ure 50 to 60 Quar|ter,
from 20. Now the Fraud of this lies
here, The Malt in the Maker's Hands be|ing
gaged in the Barley, the Duty, which is
4<HI>s. per</HI> Quarter, is paid by the Mea&s;ure or
Gage of the Barley wetted; &s;o the Score, or
20 Quarter pays 4<HI>l.</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>When this Barley is malted, and the Malt
comes to be exported, the Duty of 4<HI>s. per</HI>
Quarter is drawn back by Debenture; and then
the Malt being mea&s;ured anew, the 20 Quar|ter
being encrea&s;ed to 40, draws back upon
that Mea&s;ure, and &s;o the Exporter receives 8<HI>l.</HI>
Draw-back, upon that which paid but 4<HI>l.</HI> Du|ty.
This is &s;o vile a Fraud, and &s;o openly
practis'd, that nothing is more wonderful to
me, than that no notice has yet been taken of
<PB N="14" REF="22">
it, except this, that being &s;o well known no
care has been taken to put a &s;top to it.</P>
<P>But it does not end here: As there is a
Draw-back allowed for the Malt-Duty, upon
all the exported Malt, &s;o there is a Bounty
paid to the Exporter, by the Crown, for the
encouraging the Exportation; and this is 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.
per</HI> Quarter more, which being likewi&s;e paid
upon the 40 Quarter made out of 20, encrea|&s;es
the Fraud 5<HI>l.</HI> more. So that the Crown
pays back to the Exporter 13<HI>l.</HI> for every Score
of Barley malted, and receives but 4<HI>l.</HI> by
which it is no wonder that the Malt-Tax &s;hould
be deficient.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then the <HI>Dutch</HI> pay a &s;ham Price <HI>per</HI>
Quarter for their Malt, and thus receive double
for it again, it is no wonder that they can di&s;til
a Spirit from it cheaper than the Di&s;tillers in
<HI>England,</HI> who fairly pay 6<HI>s. per</HI> Bu&s;hel to
the Crown for all their Malt, and full 6<HI>d.</HI> a
Gallon for the Spirits they draw from it.</P>
<P>Nor have the <HI>Dutch</HI> done with us yet; but
let us examine it thorowly, and we &s;hall &s;ee a
greater Fraud yet behind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> I know not by what Error on
our Side, are allow'd to import here foreign
Brandy, the Duty upon Importation being 4<HI>s.</HI>
2<HI>d. per</HI> Gallon, or thereabouts; whereas the
<HI>French</HI> Brandy pays 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d. per</HI> Gallon. This
our People take up with, and call it <HI>French</HI>
Brandy; and having &s;ufficient Proof that it
comes from abroad, are &s;atisfied with it as
&s;uch.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23">
The <HI>Dutch</HI> tell us, it is not <HI>French,</HI> tho we
have good Rea&s;on to believe that all the real
Brandy that is in it is <HI>French,</HI> by which we
are cheated that way. But that is not the
Ca&s;e; 'tis apparent, the <HI>Dutch</HI> mix their own
Malt Spirits with this Brandy, and &s;end it to
us, while our People, deluded with the Notion
that it mu&s;t be right Brandy, becau&s;e it comes
by a foreign Permit, eagerly buy it for right
Brandy, and give a Price accordingly.</P>
<P>Let any one judge then under what Di&s;ad|vantages
we carry on this Trade with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and how much it is the Intere&s;t of
<HI>England</HI> to put a Stop to it; and granting it is
our Intere&s;t, the next thing is to con&s;ider what
is the Way to do it: And that is ea&s;ily an|&s;wer'd;
the only Way is, to di&s;courage the
Importation of their adulterated Brandys, and
encourage and encrea&s;e the Di&s;tilling Trade at
home, by which &s;o many Advantages accrue
to the Nation, and the Con&s;equences of which
would yet be greater than perhaps is expected,
or than is thought po&s;&s;ible, except by &s;ome Men
of more Penetration than ordinary, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The People will by little and little be
brought off from being &s;o fond of foreign Spi|rits,
by the Difficulty of coming at them, and
the Badne&s;s of their Quality; as we &s;ee the
Ta&s;te of the Nation was effectually brought
off from the <HI>French</HI> to <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Wines, by
the Prohibitions and high Dutys of the late
War.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="24">
2. The Di&s;tillers here are apparently able
to make as good, as fine, as clean and as whole|&s;om
a Spirit, from our own Materials, as any
of tho&s;e imported from abroad; infinitely bet|ter
than the <HI>Dutch:</HI> and as they are every
Day improving, will very &s;oon, if they are
not di&s;courag'd, be able to outdo even the
<HI>French</HI> Brandy it&s;elf. And it is apparent they
produce &s;o fine a Spirit already, that a very
nice Palate cannot di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>French;</HI>
and had they the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trick of importing it
from abroad, they might ea&s;ily &s;ell it for
<HI>French</HI> Brandy, among the People.</P>
<P>I fore&s;ee, that as abundance of People are
apt ignorantly to charge the Immoralitys, and
particularly the Drunkenne&s;s of the Age, up|on
the great Encouragement of the di&s;tilling
Malt Spirits; &s;o they would make that grow|ing
Evil, a Rea&s;on again&s;t the ju&s;t Encou|ragement,
which ought to be given to the
Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Di&s;tillers as a Trade; as if
the encouraging the Di&s;tillers Bu&s;ine&s;s, would
be an encouraging of Drunkenne&s;s: whereas
we are &s;peaking of it, as a needful and an
advantageous Commerce; a Benefit to the
Publick, to the Poor, and to the whole Na|tion.
And that would be infinitely more &s;o,
if it may be encourag'd, in keeping out and
putting a &s;top to that Foreign pernicious Com|merce,
carried on to our great Lo&s;s and Di&s;ad|vantage.
As to the Vice of Drinking to Ex|ce&s;s,
we are no way concern'd in it; the
Brewing Trade, and the Wine Trade, are liable
<PB N="17" REF="25">
to the &s;ame Objections: Yet I do not find it
argued by any body, that therefore we mu&s;t
have no Beer, nor Wine.</P>
<Q><L>So ha&s;ty Showers, when they from Heaven flow down,</L>
<L>Are &s;ent to fructify, and not to drown;</L>
<L>And in the Torrent if a Drunkard &s;ink,</L>
<L>'Tis not the Brook that drowns him but the Drink.</L>
<L>But twou'd be hard, becau&s;e the Sinner's &s;lain,</L>
<L>For fear of Drowning, we mu&s;t have no Rain.</L></Q>
<P>But to clear up this Ca&s;e, upon which &s;o
much weak Cavilling has been made, I beg
leave in a kind of Hi&s;torical way, to enter a
little into the State of National Drinking in
<HI>England,</HI> as it has been, and as it now is. And
tho I &s;hall be very brief, I &s;latter my&s;elf it
&s;hall be both u&s;eful and diverting; e&s;pecially,
I an&s;wer for it, that it &s;hall come directly to
the Ca&s;e in hand; and clear not only the Di&s;|tillers
and the Di&s;tilling Trade, but even all
the Liquors they make, from the Charge of
being de&s;tructive to the Morals of the People,
or an Encouragement to Drunkenne&s;s and Ex|ce&s;s,
any otherwi&s;e than, nay not &s;o much as,
all &s;trong Liquors are &s;o to tho&s;e, who drink to
Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Our Drunkenne&s;s as a National Vice, takes
its Epocha at the Re&s;toration <HI>Anno</HI> 1661-62, or
within a very few Years after. Some run it back
to <HI>James</HI> I. Time, and refer us to the Paint|ings
on the Ceiling of the Banqueting-Hou&s;e,
for Proof of it; but I am not writing Satyres;
<PB N="18" REF="26">
I am upon a Search after not &s;o much the Vice,
as the Materials and Manufactures upon which
it is fed, and by which it was &s;upported.</P>
<P>Joy, Mirth, good Cheer, and good Li|quor,
were the Solace of the common People
in the Year 1661. They rejoiced that after
a long U&s;urpation, the King &s;hould enjoy his
own again; that after a long Series of Blood
and Confu&s;ion, and a Civil War in the Bowels
of their Country, the People &s;hould enjoy a
publick Peace and Tranquillity; that Trade
&s;hould flouri&s;h, and Plenty &s;ucceed Mi&s;ery and
Want. The&s;e were the &s;everal Rea&s;ons of their
Joy; and very merry, and very mad, and very
drunken, the People were, and grew more and
more &s;o every Day.</P>
<P>As to the Materials, Beer and Ale were con|&s;iderable
Articles; they went a great way in
the Work at fir&s;t, but were far from being &s;uf|ficient.
Strong Waters, which had not been
long in U&s;e, came in play; the Occa&s;ion was
this: In the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, it had been ob&s;er|ved,
That the Captains of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Men
of War, when they were to engage with our
Ships, u&s;ually &s;et a Hog&s;head of Brandy a|broach,
afore the Ma&s;t; and bid the Men <HI>drink
lu&s;tick,</HI> then they might <HI>fight lu&s;tick:</HI> and our
poor Seamen felt the Force of the Brandy,
&s;ometimes to their co&s;t.</P>
<P>We were not long behind them; but &s;udden|ly
after the War, we began to abound in &s;trong
Water-Shops. The&s;e were a &s;ort of petty Di&s;|tillers,
who made up tho&s;e compound Waters
<PB N="19" REF="27">
from &s;uch mixt and confus'd Tra&s;h, as they
could get to work from, &s;uch as damag'd and
eager, or &s;our Wines; Wines that had taken
Salt Water in at Sea; Lees and Bottoms; al&s;o
damag'd Sugars, and Mela&s;&s;es, Grounds of Sy|der,
and innumerable other &s;uch like. For till
then there was very little Di&s;tilling known
in <HI>England,</HI> but for phy&s;ical U&s;es. The Spi|rits
they drew were foul, and gro&s;s; but they
mixt them up with &s;uch Additions as they
could get, to make them palatable, and &s;o
gave them in general, the Name of <HI>Cordial Wa|ters.</HI>
And thus the &s;trong-Water-Shops u&s;u|ally
made a va&s;t Show of Gla&s;&s;es, labell'd
and written on, like the <HI>Gallypot Latin of
the Apothecarys,</HI> with innumerable hard
Names to &s;et them off.</P>
<P>Here, as at a Fountain, the good Wives fur|ni&s;h'd
their little Fire-&s;ide Cupboards, with a
needful Bottle for a cheri&s;hing Cup: And
hence, as from whole&s;ale Dealers, all the little
Chandlers Shops, not in <HI>London,</HI> and its ad|jacent
Parts only, but over great Part of
<HI>England,</HI> were furni&s;h'd for Sale; and to the
per&s;onal Knowledge of the Writer hereof, and
of Thou&s;ands &s;till living, not the Chandlers
Shops only, but ju&s;t as is now complain'd of,
the Barbers Shops (<HI>Barber Chirurgeons</HI> they
were then called) were furni&s;hed with the &s;ame,
and &s;old it by Retail, to the poor People who
came under their Operations.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould it be &s;o &s;upri&s;ing a Thing
then in our Opinion, that the <HI>Geneva</HI> which,
<PB N="20" REF="28">
as I &s;hall &s;how pre&s;ently, is but the &s;ame Thing
returned again, &s;hould be &s;o generally received
among the inferior Poor? &s;eeing would we but
look thus a little way behind us, it would ap|pear
that it was &s;o with our Ance&s;tors; and
our poor People are only &s;et down where their
Fore-fathers were before them, (as to the Li|quors
I mean.) As to the Difference of the
Quantitys, and whether they drank more to
Exce&s;s, than our People do now, that is a
Que&s;tion by it&s;elf, and not much to the pre|&s;ent
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But it is objected, They did not drink &s;uch
de&s;tructive Liquors then, as we do now: That
is, in &s;hort, they did not drink <HI>Geneva;</HI> for
that is the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>This Objection mu&s;t be &s;poken to as we go
along; becau&s;e it comes into the Hi&s;tory I am
upon; for it leads me to give a brief Account
of what they did drink, and where they had
it. I have mentioned the Introduction of the
&s;trong-Water-Shops, and petty Di&s;tillers, who
began this Trade. I come now to the Liquors;
&s;ome of their Names were as follow.</P>

<PB N="21" REF="29">
<P>But to &s;um up the whole, <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> and An|ni&s;eed
Water, were the Captains or Leaders;
and the &s;trong Inclinations of the People run all
into tho&s;e two: And in a little while the latter
prevail'd over the former too; and as Anni&s;eed
Water was the only Liquor for &s;ome Years, the
Quantity that was drunk of it, was prodigious
great: In a word, it was the <HI>Geneva</HI> of the&s;e
Times, it was not only &s;old in the Chandlers
Shops, and in the Barbers Shops, as above;
and perhaps in Bulks and Stalls too; but it
had this particular Article attending it, (which
we are not yet arrived to with the <HI>Geneva</HI>)
<HI>viz.</HI> That it was cried about Sreets, of which,
the Memory of the famous <HI>Anni&s;eed Robin,</HI>
will be a never-dying Te&s;timony; who was &s;o
well known in <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> and the <HI>Stocks-Market</HI>
for his Liquor, and his broad-brim'd|Hat,
that it became proverbial, when we &s;aw
a Man's Hat hanging about his Ears, to &s;ay,
<HI>he looks like Anni&s;eed Robin.</HI></P>
<P>This Part, <HI>viz.</HI> of going about the Streets,
and into the Fields, to Shows, and Mu&s;ters of
the Trained Bands, to cry a <HI>Dram of the Bot|tle,</HI>
has not been &s;o long omitted, but that we
can all remember it: And the Bumboats, who
continue to this Day, crying a <HI>Dream of the
Bottle,</HI> in the River, among the Ships, are a
Remainder of that Cu&s;tom, and which was ne|ver
left off at-all.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not however have troubled you
with the&s;e In&s;tances from <HI>Low Life,</HI> but that
it is in the Scene we are now acting; and this
<PB N="22" REF="30">
<HI>Anni&s;eed Robin</HI> was a magnipotent Fellow in
his Day, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Having thus brought you back to the Dram|drinking
Age, I mu&s;t let you &s;ee how a full
Stop was put to it on a &s;udden, and what be|came
of the drinking World in the mean time.</P>
<P>As all the&s;e various &s;orts of good Liquor
had their Meridian, &s;o they had too their De|clination,
and after &s;ome time they fell into a
general Di&s;like: For the French out-did them
exceedingly, and pouring in their Liquors at
a very cheap rate, and the Goodne&s;s of the
Brandy recommending it &s;elf al&s;o, the famous
<HI>Anni&s;eed Water</HI> began to lo&s;e Ground, and
the People took their Drams in plain Brandy;
the Phy&s;icians al&s;o, on all Occa&s;ions, telling
the People, it was better than any of their com|pounded
Waters.</P>
<P>Thus the be&s;t Brandy being &s;old for 2<HI>d. per</HI>
Quartern, the Poor could have a large Dram
for a Half-penny; and the Fellows that cry'd
it about the Streets, carry'd with them little
double Dram-Cups, which being held up on one
&s;ide was a Penny, and on the other &s;ide a
Half-penny.</P>
<P>This held on for &s;everal Years, and the Cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e
Books will &s;hew the prodigious Con|&s;umption,
till the late Revolution; when a fu|rious
and continu'd War the <HI>France</HI> breaking
out, a Prohibition of Trade follow'd, Brandy
ro&s;e from 2<HI>d.</HI> to 6<HI>d. per</HI> Quartern, and from
thence to a Scarcity, &s;o that none good was
be had. The Di&s;tillers not being yet come into
<PB N="23" REF="31">
the way of Di&s;tilling from Malt, could not &s;up|ply
them; and thus the Poor were thrown off
from the Dram-Cup to the Alehou&s;e-Pot, to
their great Regret, as well as Expence: For
now they could call for nothing le&s;s than a
Pint, which tho for a while it was but a Pen|ny,
yet &s;oon after, by doubling the Exci&s;e,
came up to three Half-pence, where it &s;till
&s;tays. And thus I have gone thro' the fir&s;t
Part of my Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It remains a Que&s;tion, which I believe is
not yet determin'd, tho I &s;ee not much Diffi|culty
in it, Whether the Morals of the People
were the better or the wor&s;e by this Change?
If I may u&s;e &s;o much Freedom, I in&s;i&s;t that they
are much the wor&s;e: And as my Rea&s;ons for
it are of &s;ome weight in the pre&s;ent Debate, I
beg you will hear them &s;umm'd up as briefly for
your Convenience as I can.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Charge was immediately increas'd,
and a poor Man that could before be refre&s;h'd
in his Labour, at the &s;mall Expence of a Half|penny,
was now oblig'd to &s;pend three Half|pence
at a time, as often as either Nece&s;&s;ity or
Inclination call'd him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Expence of Time was immediately al|&s;o
encreas'd; for then poor Men in their Stails,
or Garrets, or Shops, or wherever they were
at their work, could call in, and call up, poor
<HI>Anni&s;eed Robin,</HI> or any of his Contemporarys
or Succe&s;&s;ors, and take a Dram, without the
lea&s;t Lo&s;s of their Time, and go on with their
<PB N="24" REF="32">
Work: Or if they were at Day-Labour in the
Field or the Street, in the Wet and the Cold,
they could call for a Dram for a Penny or a
Half-Penny, as their Pockets could afford, and
go on with their Bu&s;ine&s;s; whereas upon this
Change the Poor were really di&s;tre&s;s'd, and
they made loud Complaints of it, as I very well
remember.</P>
<P>Having thus gone thro' the Hi&s;tory of what's
pa&s;t, and given you &s;ome Account of the man|ner
of our Drinking till within the&s;e few Years,
allow me to bring it on to our own Times, and
view our Poor in the pre&s;ent Situation of their
great Affair, I mean of Liquor; for what they
&s;hall drink is (I a&s;&s;ure you) no matter of mean
Concern to them.</P>
<P>The Poor, as above, having been reduc'd to
the mi&s;erable Nece&s;&s;ity of this Alehou&s;e-Tip|pling,
and grown &s;ick of the tedious and dull,
as well as expen&s;ive way of Drinking, were ap|parently
ripe for a Change, if they could have
found any way to their Advantage; when on
a &s;udden the diligent <HI>Dutch,</HI> fruitful <HI>at Inven|tion,</HI>
as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are at <HI>Imitation,</HI> (and
with their own Advantage at the bottom you
may be &s;ure,) help'd them out again, <HI>as they
had done once before:</HI> for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sutlers
carry'd into the Camps in <HI>Flanders,</HI> during
the late long Wars again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> a certain
new di&s;till'd Water call'd <HI>Geneva,</HI> being a good
whole&s;om Malt Spirit, if rightly prepar'd,
wrought up with Juniper-Berries; a Thing not
only whole&s;om, but really phy&s;ical, and for
<PB N="25" REF="33">
many Years allow'd to be &s;o by the mo&s;t cele|brated
Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>It was &s;trange to ob&s;erve, how this Liquor
prevail'd in the Army; how the Soldiers were
&s;urprized at the Goodne&s;s of it; the Spirit,
the Vigor it put into them: They declar'd
publickly to one another, there never was
any &s;uch Liquor heard of in the World; it put
a perfectly new Spirit, and new Life into
them; and invigorated them at &s;uch a rate,
that it made them quite a new kind of Peo|ple.</P>
<P>At
fir&s;t, like the Champaign and Burgundy,
it was drank among the Gentlemen only; a
Drink for Generals, and for Officers: Nay,
they tell us in <HI>Holland,</HI> that even the great
D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> gave it a Character as a Thing
that in&s;pir'd Nature with a new Flame; and
put a &s;ort of Vigor into the Mind, which Nature
it&s;elf was a Stranger to before; and that he
recommended the (moderate) U&s;e of it, to
the greate&s;t Men, when they were going at
any time to engage the Enemy.</P>
<P>It is a great Mi&s;take to argue from hence,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> always made their Soldiers mad
with Drink, before they led them out to

of the Generals and Officers, before the Sol|diers
came to have any fellow-feeling of this
Article.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, no doubt the <HI>Dutch</HI> made a fine
Spirit of it, and as perfect as it was po&s;&s;ible to
be expected: But as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are hardly to
be charged with any Deficiency in needful
<PB N="26" REF="34">
Craft, and that they &s;aw plainly what was good
for the High, was al&s;o good for the Low; and
that the poor Soldiers Money was as good to
them as the great Generals, if they could but
make it out in Quantity; they &s;oon came into
the old Trading Maxim, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapne&s;s
cau&s;es Con&s;umption, and found out a Way to
make a Sort of the &s;ame Spirit, and drawn
perhaps from the &s;ame Ingredients; that be|ing
made meaner in Quality, &s;hould be propor|tioned
to the Pur&s;e, as well as to the Palate
of the common Soldiers.</P>
<P>And thus the Soldiers in the Confederate
Camp, came to the honour of Drinking upon
a Level with their Officers, or at lea&s;t, flat|tering
them&s;elves that they did &s;o, which in|deed
was almo&s;t the &s;ame Thing; and if there
was any apparent Difference, it was &s;uch that
neither Officers or Soldiers were nice enough
in their Palates to judge of.</P>
<P>It would interrupt our Bu&s;ine&s;s and the main
De&s;ign of this Work, to dwell too long upon
the particular Steps and Gradations, by which
<HI>Geneva</HI> gain'd &s;o much upon the Minds of the
common People; or to enquire into the Rea|&s;ons
of it: If what I have &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> its being
thus approved by their general Officers, gave
the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion, it is &s;ufficient to tell you,
that by this means the <HI>Geneva</HI> gain'd a va&s;t Cre|dit
among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops; from the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> it &s;pread univer&s;ally among all the Con|federate
Armys; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers be|came
as great Admirers of it, as any other
Nation what&s;oever; except the mere <HI>Dutch</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="35">
them&s;elves, for they indeed drank it like Mo|thers-Milk.</P>
<P>But
you are to take notice here, that the &s;ubtle
Di&s;tillers, and particularly the wi&s;e Merchants
of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who had felt the Sweet of the
Trade, had con&s;ulted together to bring this Part
to &s;ute with their Intere&s;t al&s;o; namely, That
the <HI>Geneva</HI> which they &s;ent to the Army for the
U&s;e of the Officers and Gentlemen, (e&s;pecially
General Officers) bore a different Price from
that which was open'd for the ordinary u&s;e of
the Army, and for the common Soldiers: Whe|ther
it differ'd in Virtue and Value or not, I
cannot enter into here; for in &s;uch Liquors as
the&s;e, I &s;hall not an&s;wer for it, that what is &s;old
for the highe&s;t Price, is always of be&s;t Qua|lity
in proportion: &s;ometimes, Fancy ground|ed
upon an advanc'd Demand, an&s;wers to
Goodne&s;s, and makes an Equivalent to the
Quality of the Liquor; nor could tho&s;e litle
needful Frauds be always carried on without it:
but of that by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let this Part be one way or other, and be
the Liquor better or wor&s;e, this is certain, the
Price was reduc'd in the common Suttlers-Car|riages;
and the poor Soldiers had their <HI>Gin</HI> at
a Rate fit for a poor Soldier to pay: And this
too betray'd a Secret in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commerce,
which it has been proper to mention already;
and for the &s;ake of which, this Part has been
mention'd here; and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;peak of, namely, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> were ena|bled
<PB N="28" REF="36">
to bring down the Price of their <HI>Geneva,</HI>
even without reducing the Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay, that it &s;eems ex|ceeding
hard, that as our Di&s;tillers were not
then come into the Thing, and that <HI>Geneva</HI> was
not known here; they &s;hould find them&s;elves
&s;o oppre&s;&s;ed, at their fir&s;t Entrance; and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould be able not only to make their
own Spirits <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> cheapter than we
could, but that they &s;hall be &s;till able to import
them upon us fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than we
can make them, and yet rai&s;e them from the
&s;ame Materials, namely, from our own Corn.</P>
<P>And here there is &s;uch an allow'd Conce&s;|&s;ion
made by the whole Legi&s;lature of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> to one of the Articles &s;umm'd up in
the fir&s;t Part of this Work, namely, of the
va&s;t Advantage the con&s;uming of Corn is to the
Landed Intere&s;t, that I could not but remind the
Reader of it; namely, The allowing back all
the Duty upon Malt, and 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Bounty-Money
upon the exporting it as Barley, which
if the Sums drawn back by Certificate, in the
Countries of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> only, are ca&s;t
up, will appear &s;urpri&s;ing in Value: I &s;ay, it
is a full Conce&s;&s;ion to our Argument, and no|thing
but a full Conviction that the exporting
it, is infinitely advantageous to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
can be a ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>Were the Commons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to have
been told when that Law was made, that all
or the greate&s;t Part of the Bounty, whatever
Sums were drawn from the Publick by it, would
<PB N="29" REF="37">
only have two Effects, and both of them per|nicious
to the Briti&s;h Commerce in general, and
to the Revenue in particular; it is my Opinion
they would have con&s;ider'd better of it, before
they had pa&s;s'd it into a Law, or have put it in
the Power of a voracious Set of Men, to have
ruin'd &s;o great and ri&s;ing a Manufacture, and
Branch of our Commerce, at our own Expence.</P>
<P>Were tho&s;e Bountys taken off for a while,
or were they reduc'd a little to a tolerable De|gree,
the Con&s;equence would pre&s;ently be this,
That the <HI>Dutch</HI> could no more draw a Spirit
50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper from our own Materials,
than we could, or import it upon us, mixt
among <HI>French</HI> or other Foreign Brandys, &s;o
much to our Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>What Rea&s;on can be alledged, why the
<HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould be able to extract a better Spirit
from the fame Goods? Nay, it is evident,
they do not, and we are a&s;&s;ur'd they cannot;
but they have gotten into a Cour&s;e of uncon|trolled
K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry, and by this they can &s;end it
over cheaper, and that is &s;ufficient to all the
re&s;t; for Cheapne&s;s cau&s;es Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But to return to the Article above: When
fir&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> came into this Trade, as I
hinted before <HI>p.</HI> 25. they took their Malt &s;o
rough, &s;o grown, and &s;o undre&s;s'd, that it was
frequent for a Score of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Barley at that
time, to hold out 50 to 60 quarters of Malt,
at the Exportation; which accordingly magni|fied
the Fraud, and entitled the Exporter to
receive back twelve Pound for a Score of Bar|ley;
<PB N="30" REF="38">
which upon being gaug'd in the Ci&s;tern,
paid to the Crown but 4<HI>l.</HI> Duty; and &s;o again
in the Bounty: But they have been pleas'd to
be a little le&s;s barefac'd &s;ince, and have (thanks
to their Mode&s;ty) reduc'd it by a &s;light Dre&s;|&s;ing,
as above, to forty Quarters for twenty.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> There is a little Cavil which may
be rais'd here; and we doubt not our Oppo|&s;ers
will think, they have &s;ome Advantage in
it, namely, That the Barley does generally
&s;well one in the Score, before the gauging:
but we may an&s;wer that by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To what Extremes do we &s;ee wi&s;e Men run,
upon wrong Information of Things; and yet
how little Care do they take to be rightly and
better inform'd of the Things they are mi&s;ta|ken
about? It will perhaps be very hard to
per&s;uade Men of common Sen&s;e to believe,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> can import their Spirits ex|tracted
from our Materials, 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheap|er
than we can make them; and yet, at the
&s;ame time prove too, that all the ordinary Parts
of the Workman&s;hip about them, may be per|formed
as cheap in <HI>London,</HI> as in <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that when they
come to be more fully and rightly inform'd of
things, and to &s;ee what a Cheat is put upon the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, in the Conditions upon which
they get their Corn, which are the Materials;
the Riddle is expounded pre&s;ently, and we
cannot &s;uppo&s;e Men to have common Sen&s;e,
who will not then open their Eyes to it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="39">
But to come back to theCamp: Our sol|diers
ta&s;ting this Liquor, brought the De|&s;ire,
as well as the Fame of it, over with
them <HI>at the en&s;uing Peace;</HI> and our Di&s;|tillers
preparing it as well here, as the <HI>Dutch</HI>
abroad, they &s;upply'd the People with it,
wrought from our own Corn the Product of
our own Land, very much to our Advan|tage,
as has been &s;aid already: the Encrea&s;e

of our own Malt, to a very great
degree.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, <HI>Bacchus</HI> and the <HI>Brewer</HI> take Um|brage
at this Inva&s;ion: and tho what between
the <HI>Wine-Brewer,</HI> and the <HI>Beer-Brewer,</HI> they
have had the poi&s;oning Trade to them&s;elves to
long, that one would think they &s;hould be &s;a|tiated
with the Mi&s;chiefs of it, tho they were
not with the Profits, yet it &s;eems they do not
&s;it ea&s;y under it; tho I am told the Pretence
of the Brewing Trade being declined on this
Account, is but a Pretence, and no more. It
&s;eems they could have been content with it in
the Apothecarys Shops, and allow'd it among
the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to pa&s;s for good Phy|&s;ick:
but when they found it applied to the
defeat of <HI>Tippling</HI> and <HI>Sotting,</HI> as above, they
re&s;olv'd again&s;t it, as fatal and de&s;tructive to the
Health, and Under&s;tanding; and that as to the

with any thing, rather than <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="40">
It is a poor Foundation to rai&s;e Clamour

fir&s;t, and which if an End were put to it,
would both do the Crown and the Revenue

<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, (how weak|ly,

will be a Means to cure all the Evils which
they acknowledge &s;eem to be growing upon

<P><PB N="34" REF="42">
And if after all it &s;hould further appear that
the Propo&s;al it&s;elf comes from a Quarter where
no &s;uch &s;anative Principles as the&s;e of pre&s;erving

from a View to &s;eparate and corrupt Ends,
tending in them&s;elves to &s;upport the Intere&s;t of

<P>Let us then endeavour to &s;tate the Ca&s;e clear|ly,
among us</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Dutch</HI> do cheat, and impo&s;e
upon us already, mo&s;t gro&s;ly and barefacedly;
or rather to put it right, the Exporters of the
Malt to <HI>Holland,</HI> do cheat and impo&s;e upon
us: (for if the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not the Men, let us
not wrong the Devil, but lay the Saddle on the
right Hor&s;e.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That by this Cheat, let who will be in it,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Di&s;tillers (for we are not talking
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as a Nation, but as Traders, and
e&s;pecially as Di&s;tillers) are enabled to buy
their Malt for le&s;s than half the Price which
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;tillers give for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That by this means they are likewi&s;e ena|bled
to work their Spirits (whether the <HI>Gene|va</HI>
or other Spirits) for we are not now &s;peaking
of one &s;ort more than another, &s;o cheap as to
&s;ell them one time with another for at lea&s;t 50
<PB N="35" REF="43">
<HI>per Cent.</HI> le&s;s Price, than our Di&s;tillers can
work them for, from the &s;ame Materials.</P>
<P N="4">4. That by the Advantages, Di&s;gui&s;es, and va|rious
Kinds of crafty Ways which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have, for di&s;po&s;ing and di&s;per&s;ing the&s;e Spirits
among our People, under the Names of Fo|reign

(for they always find the way to
make us the Tools of our own Delu&s;ions) they
have an Opportunity to &s;ell that 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
dearer than we do, which they can make 50
<HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper.</P>
<P>Let any con&s;idering Per&s;on take the&s;e Things
in pieces a little, and examine them &s;eparately.</P>
<P>All Errors and Mi&s;takes of Mankind, are
much better and ea&s;ier prevented in Principle,
than corrected in Practice; as Fire is ea&s;ier

The fir&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all the Mi&s;chiefs that
can be complain'd of in the Di&s;tilling Trade, are

<P>This Encouragement, were there nothing
more in it, is very con&s;iderable; and gives
the <HI>Dutch</HI> a va&s;t Advantage over our Di&s;tillers
here at home, who pay this whole Duty with|out
any Draw-back, Bounty, or other Encou|ragement
what&s;oever; except it be, that they
al&s;o pay a heavy Duty upon the Spirits again,
after they are di&s;till'd; in&s;tead of which, the
<HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ending their Spirits hither, by the help
of another Fraud &s;ub&s;equent to all the re&s;t,

But after we have con&s;idered the heavy

what is mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 13. and undeniably made

apparently to our own Intere&s;t, as to lie open

it; and then they may put it into a

afterwards put upon it, with the greater Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Let them unload it from the dead Weight,
which the&s;e clande&s;tine Practices are not to
the Trade only, but to the whole Nation; for
in &s;hort, 'tis a Tax levied upon us, to give to
a &s;et of clande&s;tine Traders: whether they are
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> or any Men, where
the Malt is &s;hip'd for <HI>Holland,</HI> 'tis the &s;ame
thing, 'tis a National Grievance, and a Bur|den
upon the Trade, which ought to be remo|ved.</P>
<P>All
Inequality of Burthens, is a Prejudice
to the fair Trader; in the Sen&s;e of which
Maxim, it has always been the Care of our
Crown by an Equality of Burthens, to give
the fair Trader a due Advantage: Hence &s;mug|gling

and clande&s;tine Trade, is on &s;o many Ac|counts
guarded again&s;t, and by &s;o many Laws
made criminal among us, tho &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to
be fully prevented.</P>
<P>But here is a Law, which however good in
it &s;elf, and intended with the &s;ame ju&s;t View,
is unhappily, and by the Craft of a &s;et of Fo|reigners,
perverted, the Point of it turn'd up|on
the fair Traders; and the greate&s;t clande&s;|tine
Fraud that ever was, (of its kind) prac|ti&s;ed
in <HI>England,</HI> is &s;et up by its Authority:
So that the Cheat is &s;upported by the very
Law that was made to prevent it; may, it is
founded upon the very Execution of that Law
of Equality, on which Ju&s;tice was to have
been expected.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of an encouraging Draw-back, by
which the Con&s;umption of our Growth was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ecur'd, and in order to which
the Exporter to have the Benefit of all; the
Duty that was paid being return'd to him, he
receives 4<HI>l. per</HI> Score in one Article more than
ever was paid, and 2<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> in another, more
than ever was intended.</P>
<P>I have often heard it &s;poken of, with &s;ome
wonder, in <HI>England,</HI> how it came to pa&s;s, that
in &s;ome particular Places on the Coa&s;ts, the
Draw-back upon the Duty on Malt came to
more than the Duty it &s;elf; as was alledg'd
once likewi&s;e in the Affair of the <HI>Salt-Duty,</HI>
and by which, as I have been told, a gro&s;s
Abu&s;e of the Publick afterwards was detected.
Whether it was &s;o in the Salt or no, and how
<PB N="40" REF="48">
it came about, is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s: But
if it be &s;o likewi&s;e in the Malt Draw-back, I
believe, upon a due Enquiry into the Rea&s;on
of it, &s;ome of the&s;e wicked Things might come
to light, and perhaps more than &s;ome People
are aware of.</P>
<P>But to reduce all this to the true End for
which all &s;uch Complaints ought to be made,
namely, the preventing the like; and &s;uppo|&s;ing
it to be detected and prevented, as we hope
it may, what are we to enquire next?</P>
<P>The next Que&s;tion is, How would this re|form
the Abu&s;es of the Di&s;tilling? My An&s;wer
is direct, in two Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You would then have no Abu&s;es to cor|rect
but our own; whereas now all the Cor|ruptions
and Adulterations of Foreigners, are
put to our home-Account.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Di&s;tillers then being, as is &s;aid, again
&s;ecur'd and form'd into a Body, with due Pow|ers
to act by, and &s;ufficient Encouragement, are
able to an&s;wer for all Abu&s;es of the Trade, that
is, they are able to an&s;wer that there &s;hould be
no Abu&s;es committed, no unwhole&s;om Liquors
di&s;tilled, or &s;old if they were di&s;till'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, there would be nothing
left for the Crown to be concern'd in, but to
prevent if they can, the Intemperance of the
People,</P>
<P>Nor would &s;uch a Regulation want its En|couragement
even in the Nature of the thing;
there are many Ways to encrea&s;e the Revenue,
<PB N="41" REF="49">
be&s;ides loading Trade with new Taxes. If this
particular Branch, clogg'd with Difficulties, and
oppre&s;s'd by Foreigners, Smuglers, and the
like, may be &s;et free from tho&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ions
and Weights, giving it room to encrea&s;e,
encrea&s;es the Revenue of cour&s;e; whereas
while it &s;inks under tho&s;e Weights, adding Du|tys
only &s;erves to &s;ink it deeper, and &s;o even
le&s;&s;ens the Revenue which it paid before.</P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e exactly with the late high
Dutys upon Pepper; while tho&s;e Dutys &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted,
the Revenue was devour'd, I think I may
&s;ay wholly devour'd, by the Draw-backs; and
all the Home-Con&s;umption of Pepper was &s;up|ply'd
by clande&s;tine Trade, that is to &s;ay, by
Smuglers; whereas tho&s;e high Duties being
again taken off, the Trade return'd into its
own Channel, and the Revenue reviv'd which
was &s;unk before.</P>
<P>Thus if the Di&s;tilling Trade &s;hould be
loaded with more Duties, while the&s;e Frauds
on the Foreign Trade &s;till remain unredre&s;s'd,
what mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e but this, namely, The
Foreigners would have all the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the
Di&s;tillers might put out their Fires and &s;it
&s;till?</P>
<P>But I meet with another popular Objection
&s;till, and it &s;hews a little from what Quarter
all the re&s;t has come. The Objection is this:</P>
<P>That the Di&s;tillers pay too &s;mall an Exci&s;e,
that they may pay a little higher Duty very
well, and that they do not pay an Equality
with the Brewer upon a Quarter of Malt.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50">
Now, tho this &s;eems a little envious at be&s;t,
&s;uppo&s;ing we &s;hould grant the Sugge&s;tion, as
if the Brewer was unea&s;y that any Malt &s;hould
be con&s;um'd but what &s;hould pay as great a
Duty as that which their own Trade pay;
yet as it happens not to be &s;o in fact, it ex|po&s;es
the Objector &s;o much the more, and
leaves us to gue&s;s (a little the plainer) whence
the&s;e Clamours at the Di&s;tillers had at lea&s;t
&s;ome of their Original. I &s;hall enquire into
the Particulars pre&s;ently, but &s;hall name ano|ther
Objection of &s;omething a like nature along
with it.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid, there is a &s;udden and great De|cay
of the Brewing Trade in <HI>London;</HI> and this
too they would place to the account of the
Di&s;tilling Trade; as if the Di&s;tillers were ri&s;ing
upon the Fall of the Brewers; all which are
mere groundle&s;s Jingles of a few de&s;igning
Men, who would de&s;erve more regard if they
&s;poke truth, and as they are mi&s;taken, de|&s;erve
indeed little or none at all.</P>
<P>It is true, we have not room here to give
a large and particular An&s;wer to all the&s;e
Cavils; for &s;uch we hope to prove them to
be and no more. But yet we cannot clo&s;e
this Tract without letting them know that we
have heard all they have to &s;ay upon the&s;e ma|terial
Heads; which upon the whole, amounts
to but very little in Sub&s;tance, tho much
perhaps in Noi&s;e and Pretences. The whole
may be briefly an&s;wer'd in the following Par|ticulars,
re&s;erving a more full and particular
<PB N="43" REF="51">
An&s;wer, as we may hereafter &s;ee occa&s;ion.
But to take them as they lie:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;o far from being true, that the
Di&s;tillers pay le&s;s Duty upon a Quarter of
Malt than the Brewer, that 'tis evident they
pay <HI>more.</HI> And not to enter at this time
into a Calculation of the Particulars, here not
being room for it, this we may undertake to
a&s;&s;ert, namely, That the Di&s;tillers pay near
12<HI>s. per</HI> Quarter upon the Malt they u&s;e,
allowing a ju&s;t proportion for its being not
dre&s;t down to the &s;ame Finene&s;s, and con|&s;equently
the &s;ame Mea&s;ure as that of the
Brewers.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, the Brewers, the
Dre&s;&s;ing of their Malt being likewi&s;e con&s;i|der'd,
do not pay above 8<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> on
each Quarter.</P>
<P>For let it be con&s;idered here what is ob&s;erv'd
already in its place, and ought to have notice
taken of it on all occa&s;ions; namely, that for
the Double-Beer, Pale-Ales, Stout, and &s;uch
like Drinks, which the Brewers now run &s;o
much upon, and in which they do not draw
near &s;o great a length from a Quarter as in
the ordinary Brewing, they of cour&s;e do not
pay &s;o much to the Crown for the Exci&s;e;
nay, for the&s;e Liquors they may be &s;aid not
to pay &s;ix Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter on the Malt:
whereas the Di&s;tillers always extracting the
utmo&s;t Spirit the Malt will put forth, and
paying as much Duty for the meane&s;t Malt
as the Brewer does for the be&s;t, has an infi|nite
<PB N="44" REF="52">
Di&s;advantage, and pays more for his Malt,
by how much the le&s;s Spirit he extracts from
it.</P>
<P>This, as above, will require a more full Ex|planation,
and on occa&s;ion &s;uch an Explana|tion
will not be wanting; but in the mean
time, tho&s;e who make the Objection know
&s;o much of the Truth of it, that they are
able to &s;ave us the Labour, and an&s;wer them|&s;elves,
tho at this time perhaps &s;uch generous
Treatment may not be for their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I go back then to the fir&s;t Head, namely,
That there is a great and &s;udden Decay of the
Brewing Trade. My An&s;wer is,</P>
<P N="1">1. There has been no apparent Decay of
the Brewing Trade, one Year with another, for
above four Years pa&s;t, to la&s;t <HI>Mid&s;ummer;</HI> what
Decay has been mu&s;t be &s;ince that time.</P>
<P N="2">2. By con&s;equence then the great encrea&s;e
of the Con&s;umption of Spirits in <HI>England</HI> has
not been the Cau&s;e of the Decay of the &s;aid
Brewing: for as that Encrea&s;e has been of three
or four Years continuance, why, if it decay'd
the Brewing Trade, was it never felt till &s;ince
<HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> la&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3. There has been no proportion'd Advance
upon the Di&s;tillery &s;ince <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> la&s;t;
why then &s;hould the Decay of one be occa&s;ion'd
by the other, which has not felt the Effect of
it? If the Di&s;tilling had encreas'd in propor|tion
during that time, and that, &s;o much more
than ever it had done before, then indeed the
Water of one Channel being found in the
<PB N="45" REF="53">
Stream of another, would account for the
difference. But as that is not &s;o in fact, the
Deficiency mu&s;t be from &s;ome other more ap|parent
Cau&s;e, and that we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The apparent Cau&s;es of the Decay or &s;ud|den
&s;top of the Brewing, &s;o far as the Fact
may be granted, (for it is not &s;o mighty in
Fact as in Noi&s;e) are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. The exce&s;&s;ive Dearne&s;s of Hops the la&s;t
Sea&s;on, which was &s;o heavy a Rent-Charge
upon the Brewer, that it really put a check
to their whole Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;ome of them
found it hard to furni&s;h them&s;elves with a
&s;uitable Stock upon any Terms whatever: That
Difficulty has of cour&s;e cau&s;ed them to le&s;&s;en
the Quantity of Beer among their Cu&s;tomers,
as much as they could, when they came to
lay in their Stores.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Dearne&s;s of Malt it &s;elf, which by
the univer&s;al Badne&s;s of the Sea&s;on in all the
Malting Counties, has had an effect upon the
Malt as well as upon other Grain; this has both
le&s;&s;en'd the Quantity and advanc'd the Price,
&s;o that Malt in particular has been 5 to 6<HI>s.
per</HI> Quarter dearer this Year than it was the
la&s;t. The&s;e things have been &s;o apparent,
and here &s;o well known to other People as
well as to the Brewers them&s;elves, that 'tis
&s;omething &s;trange they &s;hould lay them&s;elves
open to &s;o effectual a Reply.</P>
<P>But this too will appear le&s;s &s;trange when
we &s;hall add, that the K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ery of the Brewers
them&s;elves, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, may have
<PB N="46" REF="54">
&s;ome &s;hare in the Rea&s;ons for a &s;udden Decay
of their Trade; e&s;pecially if it be true that they
have come into that bare-fac'd piece of Policy,
<HI>viz.</HI> To &s;trike their Work in order to le&s;&s;en
the Exci&s;e, and &s;o make a joint Clamour for
promoting the De&s;ign. But of this we may
&s;ay more in its proper Place.</P>
<P>But now, to put in a Word for the Poor, as
well as for the Trade, and &s;o to clo&s;e this Di&s;|cour&s;e;
you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, that were
it &s;o that they had quite for&s;aken the drinking
Beer and Ale, and were wholly come in|to
the drinking of Spirits, Brandy, Geneva,
or what you plea&s;e; it &s;eems to me they have
done not only that which their Ance&s;tors did
before them, but even what their Superiors
have &s;eem'd to lead them into ju&s;t now, by a
general Example. As follows.</P>
<P>There has been for &s;ome Years, and &s;till
continues among us. a national Gu&s;t or Inclina|tion
to drinking &s;tronger and highe pric'd Li|quors
than formerly; I do not &s;ay we drink
more, or more to Exce&s;s, that is a Subject of
another Nature, and however true, is not to
my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. But the Stream of the
Nation's Palate runs, I &s;ay, for &s;tronger and
dearer Liquors. Let me begin at the Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ladys</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of Quality and
Di&s;tinction, not content with the u&s;ual, and
as I have &s;aid above, mo&s;t whole&s;om Dram,
call'd right <HI>French</HI> Brandy, now treat with
<HI>Ratafia</HI> and <HI>Citron,</HI> at a Guinea a Bottle.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55">
The <HI>Punch Drinkers</HI> of Quality, (if any
&s;uch there be) not contented with the be&s;t
<HI>French</HI> Brandy in their Bowls, mu&s;t have <HI>Ar|rack</HI>
at 16<HI>s.</HI> to 18<HI>s. per</HI> Gallon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wine Drinkers</HI> of the better &s;ort, not
content with the <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Barcelona</HI>
Wines, mu&s;t have high Country <HI>Morgeau,
O Brian</HI> and <HI>Hermitage</HI> Clarets, at 5<HI>s.</HI> to
6. <HI>per</HI> Bottle; and after that <HI>Champagn</HI> and
<HI>Burgundy</HI> at 7<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s. per</HI> Bottle.</P>
<P>The common <HI>Draft</HI> of Red Wine of <HI>Opor|to</HI>
and <HI>Viana,</HI> tho all &s;tronger than the <HI>French</HI>
Wines formerly drank, is not now &s;trong e|nough
for the <HI>Citizens;</HI> but they mu&s;t be
<HI>made up</HI> (&s;o the Wine-Brewers call it) with
<HI>Lisbons,</HI> with <HI>Alicants,</HI> and <HI>Bene-Carloes:</HI>
and the <HI>Oporto</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> Whites, tho very
&s;trong, are turn'd out of Doors, for the yet
&s;tronger <HI>Mountain Malaga.</HI></P>
<P>To de&s;cend &s;till lower: Our common Drink|ers
of <HI>Ale</HI> or <HI>Beer,</HI> are not contented as for|merly,
with the ordinary <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Beer,</HI> or
Porters <HI>Ale;</HI> but they are advanced, fir&s;t to
<HI>Two-penny,</HI> then to <HI>double-Beer,</HI> and <HI>Stout;</HI>
and now to the &s;tronge&s;t North-Country <HI>Bur|ton,</HI>
and <HI>Tamworth Pale Ale; Dorche&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Newbury Beers,</HI> and the like; of which
great Quantitys are brought up by Land Car|riage,
above 100 Miles, and for which, above
300 &s;mall-Brew-hou&s;es, have, as I am told,
been erected within the&s;e few Years, in the City
and the adjacent Parts; which Ales are &s;old
from 6<HI>d.</HI> to 10<HI>d. per</HI> Quart.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56">
In like manner then, the Poor following
this unhappy Humour of the Rich, and find|ing
them&s;elves as willing to gratify their Palate,
only not equally able to bear the Expence, are
fallen into the old Dram-drinking Way, which
their Fathers practis'd before them; and which,
as it is ea&s;y to their Pockets, &s;pends le&s;s of
their Time; and unle&s;s they plea&s;e, no more
prompts their Exce&s;&s;es, than the <HI>Beer</HI> and the
<HI>Ale</HI> did before; and if I may give my Opi|nion,
I think indeed not &s;o much. And thus
I have brought down the Hi&s;tory to our pre|&s;ent
Times.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this Tract, which is already
&s;well'd to a larger Bulk than was intended,
with a few very &s;hort Hints at the Di&s;advan|tage
which the Di&s;tillers at pre&s;ent are under in
the Cour&s;e of their Trade, and which they hope
to be deliver'd from, by the Ju&s;tice of the
Parliament, and the Encouragements which
they have rea&s;on to hope for and expect.</P>
<P>Some of the Di&s;advantages they are under,
are as follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. That whereas all the Malt exported to
<HI>Holland,</HI> and from which the <HI>Dutch</HI> extract
the Spirits which they import upon us, draws
back the whole Duty, be&s;ides a Bounty of
2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Quarter to the Exporter (not to
&s;peak of the Fraud mentioned above, and
which doubles both the Draw-back and the
Bounty) yet our own di&s;till'd Spirit upon Ex|portation
draws back but 4<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s. per</HI> Tun of
<PB N="49" REF="57">
the Exci&s;e paid, and nothing at all of the Malt
Duty.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Dutch</HI> are enabled exceedingly to
under-work and under-&s;ell the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;tiller
(even by our &s;elves) and at the Expence of
our own Crown, whom they &s;o many ways in|jure
in the &s;aid Allowances.</P>
<P N="2">2. That by the Advantages given to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> for the importing Brandy 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI>
Gallon Duty le&s;s than the <HI>French,</HI> which Du|tys
are al&s;o paid by the Importers, not by the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> they have an unre&s;train'd Liberty of
impo&s;ing their Mixtures upon us, of a ba&s;er
Kind; which Mixtures, becau&s;e they appa|rently
come from abroad, and are called Bran|dy
at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, our People are ea&s;ily
per&s;uaded to take for true Brandy, whereas it
is very well known, that many times it is in|ferior
to our common Malt Spirits, and our
Di&s;tillers affirm, they are able to out-do even
the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> by the like Artifice, come in|to
our Rivers and Ports, or at lea&s;t into the
open Roads where our Ships ride, as in <HI>Yar|mouth</HI>
Roads, the <HI>Downs, St. Helens,</HI> and
even into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> up to the
<HI>Nore</HI> and the <HI>Hope,</HI> and there &s;upply our out|ward-bound
Ships with their Spirits, or Brandys
(as they call them) not only for the &s;aid
Ship's u&s;e, but al&s;o in Quantities for Trade;
for all which no Entry is made, or any Duty
at all paid: So that our <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI>
Ships in particular, which u&s;ed to take
<PB N="50" REF="58">
in large Quantities of Liquors of our Di&s;tillers,
go away now with little or no Stores, de|pending
to be &s;upply'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the
<HI>Downs</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all great Ob&s;tructions to the Di&s;|tilling
Trade; and as they are withal great A|bu&s;es
upon the fair Traders in general, and in|jurious
to the Crown in particular, we cannot
doubt, but if fairly repre&s;ented, the Di&s;til|lers
&s;hall have &s;uch Relief, as in right and
ju&s;tice they ought to expect.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e apparent Di&s;couragements in
favour of Foreigners, and in favour of clande&s;|tine
Trade, they are unju&s;tly attack'd with
Clamours and popular Pretences, as if their
Trade was a publick Nu&s;ance, and ought to
be regulated by the Magi&s;trates; &s;ugge&s;ting,
that their Liquors are unwhole&s;om, and de&s;truc|tive,
Incentives to Vice, and tempting to the
Poor, to the Wa&s;te of their Health, Money,
Time and Under&s;tandings; Things which tho
not worth replying to, their apparent Partiali|ty
being &s;ufficiently already expo&s;ed, and as
all the Exce&s;&s;es of the People, either in the&s;e
Liquors or any other are founded in their own
Intemperance; the Di&s;tillers &s;ay, if they may
obtain &s;uch Powers and ju&s;t Authority, which as
a Company they once had, and &s;till ought to
have, and which other Companys in Ca&s;es le&s;s
e&s;&s;ential to the Health of the People now have,
&s;o as they may be able to in&s;pect and regulate
the Trade as it ought to be regulated, they
would an&s;wer to the World for the Whole&s;om|ne&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="59">
of the Liquors they extract, and appeal to
the Under&s;tanding and Sen&s;e of the mo&s;t experi|enc'd
Phy&s;icians, if unprejudic'd.</P>
<P>As for the learned and worthy Phy&s;ician,
who, if Report lyes not, is to be employ'd to
&s;how to the World the pernicious Con&s;equence
of drinking <HI>Geneva</HI> or Malt Spirits, and how
many Thou&s;ands it has &s;lain, we impatiently
wait his elaborate Performance; and to help
it forward, only beg he will not omit to prove
al&s;o, the few needful Particulars following.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Malt Spirits made in <HI>England</HI>
are much more pernicious than tho&s;e made
in <HI>Holland</HI> and &s;ent over hither, tho made
all from the &s;ame Materials.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Liquor call'd <HI>Geneva</HI> is mortal
in it &s;elf, and that the Juniper-Berries put into
it are Poi&s;on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it is the Liquor it &s;elf, not the im|moderate
U&s;e or Exce&s;s of it, that does the
Mi&s;chief.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That 'tis much better to be drunk with
Strong-Beer and Pale-Ales brew'd from Malt,
than with Spirits extracted from the &s;ame Malt,
tho it is the Spirit alone in the Beer and Ale
that intoxicates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That Drunkenne&s;s by Ale and Beer, de|&s;troys
no Health, wa&s;tes no Time, &s;pends no
Money, weakens no Under&s;tandings; and that
it is only the <HI>Geneva</HI> that does &s;uch wicked
Things as tho&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That there are more People drunk with
<HI>Geneva</HI> than with Ale and Beer, and that
a poor Man can be drunk for a Half-penny.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="52" REF="60">
7. And la&s;tly, to clench it all, Let him
prove that more People die of drinking <HI>Gene|va,</HI>
than die of the <HI>Doctor;</HI> not failing to tell
to the World, where that formidable <HI>Geneva</HI>
