<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT From the Publi&s;her.</HEAD>
<P>_THO' the following Papers are of different Forms, and upon different Sub|jects; yet there appeared no Rea&s;on, why they might not be all publi&s;hed together. I take the li|berty of mentioning this and a few things more to the Reader, becau&s;e I had a greater Latitude given me by the Per&s;on who&s;e hands the Papers came from; but I have exerted my Powers no further than in not letting the E&s;&s;ay on <HI>Self-Love</HI> come out &s;ingly, which was his Inclination: but I hope
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
I &s;hall have the publick Approbation for what I have done.</P>
<P>I had a long Letter, chiefly rela|ting to the <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> with &s;everal Hints in it, which I thought the Publick ought not to be depriv'd of; and &s;o (with the Author's allowance) I have thrown &s;ome of them into the <HI>Appendix,</HI> whereof they make the la&s;t Number. A few of his Words in that Letter &s;eem to call for a place here.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I de&s;ign'd to have &s;ent you the&s;e Papers &s;everal Years ago. . . . . . I indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hunn'd taking no|tice of &s;ome Performances that ap|pear'd at different times after this &s;mall Work was begun and ended, having &s;een them as much de&s;pis'd by the mo&s;t judicious &s;ort of Rea|ders as I thought they de&s;erv'd. . . . . . All I have in view by the <HI>E&s;|&s;ay,</HI> is, that it may &s;erve for an Introduction to Books of a deeper
<PB N="v" REF="5">
Reach. . . . . But I took all the care I could, that it might have no Air of a Religious Di&s;&s;ertation. It was indeed next to impo&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;aying &s;omewhat on the Love of God, that the contrary Doctrine might appear the more in its own Colours. . . . . ."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought it was be&s;t to add the D. of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s De&s;cription intirely, as being a Run of natural Eloquence, without <HI>Preci&s;ion,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call it; which makes it rather the more agreeable. Some|times he puts <HI>Self-Love</HI> for Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ometimes for Pride, &s;ometimes for Vanity, &s;ometimes for Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes for Ob&s;ti|nacy, &s;ometimes for mere Whim, and &s;ometimes for all the&s;e toge|ther, as appears throughout his Reflections; but &s;till he will be well enough under&s;tood: for by <HI>Self-Love</HI> he either means corrupt Nature in general, or &s;ome of its
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
particular Qualities. But with Submi&s;&s;ion. . . . . ."</Q> See the Conti|nuation of this in the la&s;t Number of the Additions.</P>
<P>The Author de&s;ign'd the re&s;t of tho&s;e Additions as an Explanation of &s;ome Terms, and a Collection of &s;ome Ci|tations to &s;upport the E&s;&s;ay, tho' it &s;tands pretty much independent of either. The Sections were al&s;o de&s;ign'd to have been of a more equal length, and the whole to have been &s;horter; but he yielded to an Advice of drop|ping in &s;ome practical Reflections, be|cau&s;e (as he own'd him&s;elf) ab&s;tract Rea&s;onings &s;eldom make a deep Im|pre&s;&s;ion. Nor was it without Reluc|tancy, that he engag'd at all in the Performance, having often &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The Nature of Mankind gives little ground to expect an Altera|tion in Opinions once receiv'd; tho' no Speculation &s;eems &s;o likely for all Parties to agree in, as that of Di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, nor any Speculation
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
that could produce &s;uch happy Ef|fects, if it was reduc'd to Prac|tice."</Q></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Dialogues,</HI> he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf as if he had been but a Wit|ne&s;s to the Conver&s;ation, and had wrote only from his Memory; and therefore &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It was to be fear'd it wou'd be a kind of Murder, and at be&s;t, to pre&s;ent the World with a Skeleton."</Q> He adds,  <Q REND="inline">"It will ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, the two Friends talk'd of many things I have taken no notice of, and that their Con|ver&s;ation was only reduc'd by me under certain Heads, and put in a different Order from what they ob&s;erv'd in talking together; for it would not have been &s;o natural to have begun with the Di&s;tinction of Body, Soul and Spirit. . . . . Per|haps the thing, &s;uch as it is, may be of u&s;e to tho&s;e who are not much acquainted with them&s;elves and the World."</Q></P>

<P>MY dear <HI>Lucinus,</HI> you are intirely in the right: and we are farther &s;aid to be made up of Body, Soul, and Spirit; a Di&s;|tinction not only u&s;ed by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but which we have al&s;o from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <BIBL>M.

<P>SENSATION is a&s;&s;ign'd to the Body, tho' 'tis the Soul that properly <HI>feels</HI> thro' the bodily Organs; the Pa&s;&s;ions or Affections are appropriated to the Soul; and Truths, or Principles, are of the Province of the Mind or the Under&s;tanding; according to that Di&s;tribution of <HI>Antoninus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT to go a degree lower than Sen|&s;ation (for Life may be conceived with|out any Operation of the Sen&s;es, as when they are &s;hut up in a deep Sleep) &s;imple Life is a thing as different from Body, or Matter, as any thing we can imagine. And there|fore Life is &s;ometimes called by the Name of <HI>Spirit,</HI> and con&s;idered both as a Principle or Spring by which <HI>Matter</HI> (who&s;e Pro|perty is to re&s;t) is moved, and the Body of
<PB N="5" REF="16">
Animals kept (for a while) from Di&s;&s;olution and Corruption:<Q>&mdash;Dum Spiritus hos regit Artus.</Q></P>
<P>OF this &s;ort of Life or Spirit, every living Creature has a &s;hare, a Worm as well as a Man; the particular Frailty of who&s;e Life we may be ea&s;ily convinc'd of, tho' the A|po&s;tle had not told us <HI>it is but a Vapour.</HI> And yet we have no other Barrier again&s;t that amazing State call'd Eternity! If the Thought of Death or &s;imple Extinction rai&s;es Horror; what would the Pro&s;pect of end|le&s;s Exi&s;tence rai&s;e, without &s;ome latent Hope, or Suppo&s;ition of Happine&s;s! A Man makes this Suppo&s;ition &s;ecretly when he thinks at all of that State, otherwi&s;e Nature could not bear the Pro&s;pect: and we mu&s;t confe&s;s our Quiet, or rather Indolence, as to an Article of &s;uch importance, is chiefly owing to our Stupidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all the Stu|pidity and Weight that loads us, there is &s;till in our Nature &s;ome Expectation of Im|mortality, &s;ome Hopes of a future Life, and a more perfect Exi&s;tence after this Scene is over. To which, if we add our De&s;ire of Dominion and E&s;teem, even in this World, we may conclude there is really &s;omething of worth in us; and our Pride may be a &s;ort of Argument for our Dignity.
<PB N="6" REF="17">
And this Elevation of Mind is not infus'd into us by Politicians, Divines, Officers of the Army, or any Set of Men what&s;oever, but may be &s;aid to be a part of our Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>DIOTREPHES <HI>loved Pre-eminence. Cae&s;ar</HI> was not taught to de&s;ire Dominion: every Man loves it (le&s;s or more) tho' not equally qualified to gain it, nor equally &s;uc|ce&s;sful. Be&s;ides, the Rewards promi&s;ed by Politicians and Commanders rather re|&s;pect the Conveniencies and Glory of this Life than the future. And whether the Re|ward be temporal or eternal, the encoura|ging or the amu&s;ing People with the Hopes of it, &s;uppo&s;es a De&s;ire in them before-hand of &s;uch things; otherwi&s;e the <HI>de&s;igning Men</HI> could have no Fund to work upon, and might as well talk to Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s there are other Arguments be|&s;ides the Pride of Man, which may help to &s;hew his Dignity. He grows weary of every thing here (Friend&s;hip only excepted) as if nothing were worthy of his Attention. But then, as nothing is able to &s;atisfy him, any thing is &s;ufficient to amu&s;e him. So that we mu&s;t con&s;ider Man in different Lights, be|fore we can under&s;tand his Condition; and after all we can think about it, our Know|ledge mu&s;t remain imperfect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is by viewing Man in tho&s;e oppo|&s;ite Lights, that he is &s;ometimes called the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Creation, and &s;ometimes its <HI>Di&s;grace</HI>; and both Epithets are true. There is &s;till in Human Nature &s;omething that's bright and lovely, good and kind; &s;ome Remains of Excellency, &s;ome Ruins of Grandeur, &s;ome Sparks in the mid&s;t of A&s;hes and Rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>THE Scripture informs us, <HI>that Man was made after the Image of God</HI>; and <HI>that we are his Offspring.</HI> 'Tis remarkable that St. <HI>Paul</HI> cites this Pa&s;&s;age from a Heathen Poet: and there was great addre&s;s in it, &s;ince he was rea&s;oning with the polite Men of <HI>Athens.</HI> But if our Pride &s;hould be apt to ri&s;e from the Account the Scripture gives us of our Origin, we &s;hall find in the &s;ame Books very different Characters to keep us low. We are call'd <HI>but Du&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Worms</HI> are <HI>our neare&s;t Kindred:</HI> 'tis told us, <HI>we are but Vanity in our be&s;t E&s;tate,</HI> and that <HI>the Imaginations of our Heart are continually fooli&s;h and wicked:</HI> with much more to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Philo&s;ophers were much divided in their Opinions concerning Man. Some exalted him too high, others &s;unk him too low; without con&s;idering the &s;trange Mix|ture of his Compo&s;ition, which indeed &s;eems
<PB N="8" REF="19">
to make him a-kin to the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t Beings, the lovelie&s;t and the hatefulle&s;t Things.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be forgot, that tho' Man|kind in general are made up of Contrarie|ties, yet, as my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Man differs more from Man, than Man from Bea&s;t.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOT only &s;o, but the &s;ame Man differs as much from him&s;elf at different times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>'TIS a &s;trange Compo&s;ition, Human Nature! But tho&s;e who talk and write again&s;t the Dignity of Man, and the Im|mortality of the Soul; who affirm there is no Virtue, no Friend&s;hip, no Honour; can only argue from what they feel in them|&s;elves, and what they ob&s;erve in the World. The fir&s;t Point might be readily yielded to them: tho' we are not ab&s;olutely &s;ure but they may have a greater belief of Virtue, and more Con&s;cience than they own; as there are others who may have le&s;s of either than they pretend to. And as to the Ob&s;erva|tion of the Decay of Virtue in the World, there is nothing oftner mention'd in the Scripture than that. In &s;hort, whatever the Opinions of particular Per&s;ons may be, hu|man Nature will &s;till remain in its Rank: and the unhappy Choices of the Multitude
<PB N="9" REF="20">
will &s;erve to confirm the &s;acred Text, <HI>Man that is in honour, and under&s;tandeth not, is like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>WHAT do you think of this Body of ours?</P>

<P>IT is by this wonderful piece of Mechani&s;m, that we hold Corre&s;pondence with the vi&s;ible World about us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE Body, as to its outward Figure, is certainly beautiful. Few are &s;o fanta&s;ti|cal, as to find fault with the human Shape. Nor are the Parts within le&s;s wonderful in their Contrivance and U&s;e. Many Engines are con&s;tantly playing. With what incredi|ble force does the Heart &s;end out the Blood! And how much work is done within us (as <HI>Antoninus</HI> &s;aid) and we feel nothing of it! When we feel lea&s;t of it, we are in the be&s;t health.</P>
<P>ANATOMISTS tell us, there is hardly an In&s;trument in Mechanicks or Hydro&s;ta|ticks but we meet with in the human Body; and indeed in the Body of inferiour Ani|mals: &s;carce any part of a Hou&s;e or a Ship, hardly a common Uten&s;il, but we find in

this &s;urprizing Fabrick. They talk of Le|vers, Wedges, Pullies, Ropes, Sieves, Strain|ers, Beams, Tubes, Va&s;es, Receptacles, and more things than I have <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for.

<P>SOME of tho&s;e laborious, pene|trating, hone&s;t Inquirers into Nature, have really made great di&s;coveries; and there re|mains &s;till much to be di&s;covered. Any body may know thus far, that this outward Vehicle of ours is made up of an infinite number of Parts, Organs, or In&s;truments curiou&s;ly adju&s;ted, and acting in a mutual Sub&s;erviency each Part to another, as well as for the Safety and Plea&s;ure of the whole Sy&s;tem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>FLESH, and Blood, and Skin, and Bones, are familiar Words, and we think very little about the Compo&s;ition and Tex|ture of the things. But we are &s;urprized when we hear that Fle&s;h it&s;elf is but a Col|lection of &s;mall Fibres; that every Mu&s;cle may be divided into le&s;&s;er ones, and the&s;e again into le&s;&s;er, till they become too &s;mall for Di&s;covery; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titut. 393.</NOTE> &s;urpa&s;&s;ing even the force of Imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22">
THE Action of the Mu&s;cles, and the Motions perform'd by their means, is a new Matter of wonder. As &s;ome of the&s;e Mo|tions are voluntary, there are others without any de&s;ign of ours. The voluntary Motions are often accompanied with Satisfaction, as the Mind directs them either to real U&s;e or Vanity: and we are beholden to the Mu&s;|cles for Dancing, as well as Walking: to the&s;e the Politician owes his Shrugs, and the nice Lady her Ge&s;tures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT at the &s;ame time, that we ad|mire the Texture of the Fle&s;h, we &s;ee evi|dent Marks of Frailty &s;tampt upon it, or &s;omething wor&s;e. The mixture of Blood and other Fluids makes the Con&s;i&s;tency the more difficult to be pre&s;erved: and upon the Breach of &s;o many Canals and Ve&s;&s;els, which a very ordinary Wound may occa&s;ion, we &s;ee a con&s;iderable Di&s;order, and have even &s;ome horror at the &s;ight. A putrify|ing Sore is &s;till more di&s;agreeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT were prudence in us however, to view our Con&s;titution &s;ometimes on its weak &s;ides, that we may not forget the Materials we are made of, or imagine a Statue of Plai&s;ter to be a Statue of Bra&s;s. The Wi&s;|dom of the Maker is &s;till &s;een in the ad|mirable Contrivance of the Machine, tho' it were to la&s;t but a day; and we have good
<PB N="12" REF="23">
rea&s;on to &s;ub&s;cribe to that Text, <HI>We are fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>WONDERFULLY indeed! but then the Tenderne&s;s of our Frame mu&s;t not &s;o frighten us, as if it were every moment to fall to pieces; and con&s;equently under the notion of &s;hunning Danger, make us &s;hun the Duties of Society. The Body is &s;trongly fenced, and can bear con&s;iderable Shocks after all. We are only to keep our Brittlene&s;s in view, as a guard to Sobriety and Temperance.

the Body, its Charms lie principally in the Out&s;ide. The figure of the inward Parts, and the endle&s;s Branchings of the Veins, are look'd at with more Complacency in Wax|work and Copper-plate than in their Reality; which mu&s;t give the Di&s;&s;ecters them&s;elves &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, not to be entirely over|come by the longe&s;t Practice.

<P>SOMETIMES one would hardly know whether to laugh or be angry at <HI>Hobbes.</HI> But tho' the Cau&s;e of Sen&s;ation is hid from us, the Advantages of it are very obvious.

They are noble Pre&s;ents from our Creator, and we &s;ee what a lo&s;s it is to be deprived of any one of them. If they are &s;ometimes the Conveyances of Pain, this is owing to &s;ome Accidents they are not an|&s;werable for; and very often the Pain is of our own procuring.</P>
<P>IF the Organs are indi&s;po&s;ed, the Sen&s;es mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e: and if they are lo&s;t the Sen&s;es are lo&s;t. 'Tis the Body that furni&s;hes the&s;e Organs, which probably has made the Emperor <HI>a&s;&s;ign the Sen&s;es to the Body.</HI></P>
<P>THE bodily Sen&s;es are al&s;o called the ex|ternal Sen&s;es, as they &s;erve us in the com|merce with things in this vi&s;ible World.

a word that may be applied to them all, yet in common di&s;cour&s;e it is appropriated to one of the&s;e five Powers in particular: &s;ome|times we &s;ay, a Sight &s;trikes the Eye, a Sound the Ear. But 'tis the Hand that's u&s;ually &s;aid to touch.

<P>FEELING or Sen&s;ibility (it &s;eems) is diffu&s;ed thro' all the Body, without and within, and &s;o is con&s;ider'd as the Founda|tion

of what is mo&s;t u&s;ually and &s;trictly call'd Plea&s;ure and Pain. The re&s;t of the Sen&s;es convey what is agreeable (the Eye Sights, and the Ear Sounds, for in&s;tance) but they are not &s;aid to create that &s;evere racking pre&s;&s;ure which goes under the name of Pain or Tor|ture, nor that gentle agreeable Impre&s;&s;ion call'd Plea&s;ure.

<P>MANKIND are in &s;ome delu&s;ion as to that point. Mr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> and others are very good, for &s;hewing the Frame and Tex|ture of the Organs belonging to each Sen&s;e. Mean time the Touch and Ta&s;te are gene|rally mo&s;t gratified, and the Ta&s;te yet more than the former. And to the&s;e two Sen&s;es may be referr'd all that's call'd Luxury: the
<PB N="29" REF="40">
Smell is but gratified in a manner for diver|&s;ion. Elegance is properly the pur&s;uit of the Eye. Sometimes, 'tis true, all Extrava|gance is call'd Luxury: as the Luxury of Building, Gardening, Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>TO enter into all the bad Con&s;equences of indulging the Sen&s;es, were an endle&s;s Af|fair. There are few Per&s;ons but know too much of it from their own Experience; with relation to their E&s;tate, their Character, and the Body it&s;elf. And if they want Authori|ties they may &s;ee what <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays of the Ef|fects of gratifying a &s;weet Tooth, as Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> calls it: <HI>Dulcia &s;e in bilem vertunt.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Inconvenience of Sen&s;uality is one thing, and the Inju&s;tice of it another. Mere &s;elfi&s;h Gratification, without regard to Society and Friend&s;hip (&s;uppo&s;ing the Heart not to be engaged in the Plea&s;ure) is a thing below Humanity, but 'tis infinitely more agreeable to think of what Nature has done for our &s;upport and delight, than what we do our &s;elves to our unea&s;ine&s;s, our de|&s;truction, and our di&s;honour. We have the Benefits and Plea&s;ures of all the Sen&s;es to think of, and we can never think of them enough.

<P>SOMETIMES, you know, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to one Sen&s;e for confir|ming another, or rectifying its mi&s;takes. But this can never overthrow the certainty of the Sen&s;es in general.

<P>THE Quickne&s;s of the Sen&s;es, as well as the Health of the Body, depends very much on Sobriety and good Rules; tho', to be &s;ure, there are higher motives for So|briety than Health and Plea&s;ure. And be|&s;ides that the Body is thus kept righter for the Exerci&s;e of its proper Functions, the Mind is freed from an exce&s;&s;ive trouble in &s;eeking after tho&s;e &s;eeming Nece&s;&s;ities of Luxury which grow upon us the more they are indulg'd, and make us delicate and fret|ful, unea&s;y to our&s;elves and others.</P>

<P>BESIDES the five Sen&s;es, the Na|turali&s;ts generally &s;peak of a <HI>Sen&s;orium,</HI> or common Sen&s;e, which they reckon the ground of all Sen&s;ation, or a <HI>Medium,</HI> as it were, for modifying the Impre&s;&s;ions and conveying them to the Mind.

<P>THIS makes no addition to the number of our Sen&s;es, whether it be granted or de|nied; it only &s;erves, as a new In&s;trument, to account in &s;ome dark manner for their Ope|rations.

MANY other things belong to the animal Life, which we may call indifferently Sen|&s;ations, Actions, Powers, Faculties.

What &s;hall we &s;ay of Hunger and Thir&s;t?

Thus Re&s;t and Motion are agreea|ble by turns: and that Faculty of moving from one place to another may be &s;aid to enlarge our Confinement, (for we are but Pri&s;oners here on Earth) &s;o that the taking a walk becomes a Plea&s;ure, were it but in a Chamber. In &s;hort, we are &s;o wonderfully contriv'd, that we can hardly &s;peak &s;en&s;e when we attempt to give any De&s;cription of our &s;elves; and mu&s;t leave many things un|touch'd after all.

and all the&s;e to the full, and of the be&s;t: what &s;hould poor Man do without Objects to entertain the re&s;t of his Sen&s;es!

And if Ideas yield to the Sen&s;es, the&s;e mu&s;t yield to the Affections. For if the Affections are not gratified, or any one of them that chances to have the Dominion for the time, what good could the whole Earth do us? Let a Man in &s;uch a &s;ituation try how he can &s;uffice him&s;elf, and make the be&s;t of his Self-Love that he can, he'll find &s;o little plea&s;ure from that Fountain, that he would wi&s;h he were out of Exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>FANCY is another word for the &s;ame Faculty; and both words are taken promi&s;|cuou&s;ly for the Faculty and the Act, and &s;ometimes for the thing imagined. Thus we &s;ay <HI>a mere Imagination, a mere Fancy.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES this Faculty is taken for Invention, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from Judg|ment: the one laying the Materials in order, which the other collects. And &s;ometimes Fancy is taken for Choice or Ta&s;te: We &s;ay <HI>a Per&s;on of a good or bad Fancy.</HI></P>

<P>BUT as we can recall ab&s;ent Images, they come &s;ometimes upon us uncall'd in a very tumultuous and irregular manner, and when we would gladly be rid of them; &s;o that we may be &s;aid to dream even in the day-time. It may be called <HI>Dreaming,</HI> tho' we do not entertain the&s;e Imaginations vo|luntarily, &s;ince they are for the mo&s;t part but Ca&s;tles in the Air. Nor is it future Pro|&s;pects only that intrude upon our Imagina|tion: there's hardly a Trifle that we have done or heard of, twenty years ago, but what breaks in upon us, and often the mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onably in the World. 'Tis difficult to fix the Attention &s;o long as not to wander before the <HI>Lord's Prayer</HI> can be repeated.

<P>THAT may be call'd involuntary Imagination. One and the &s;ame Faculty may be &s;aid to be both pa&s;&s;ive and active. The Mind has certainly a Power of rai&s;ing Images or Appearances of things within it|&s;elf, and it often feels them rais'd it knows not how.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we can tell many things the Fancy can do, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to tell every thing. It adds, it pares, it joins, it &s;epa|rates, it mixes, it jumbles, it builds, it razes; in &s;hort, it works wonders in its own Shop, and the be&s;t De&s;cription will &s;till be inferior to its power. It can frame new Ideas upon the model of old ones: as when we &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on we have not &s;een, to re&s;emble one we <HI>have</HI> &s;een; and when we frame an Idea of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from what we have &s;een of <HI>London,</HI> or perhaps but from a Map of <HI>London.</HI> This &s;ort of coining is very often a forging. Nor mu&s;t it ever be forgot, that &s;uch images are quite wrong, or rather no Images at all; that are form'd when the par|ticular Sen&s;e is wanting or hurt: as in the known Story of the blind Man, that rec|kon'd Scarlet was like the Sound of a Trumpet.</P>

<P>HOW the Imagination impo&s;es upon us when the Sen&s;es are entire, is &s;till harder to explain. But &s;ometimes we &s;ay, the Ima|gination
<PB N="37" REF="48">
is impos'd upon, when 'tis the Sen&s;e that's mi&s;taken; as when the Stick appears crooked in water: but the Error lies neither in the Sight nor in the Fancy, but only in our pronouncing too ha&s;lily. Hence we may &s;ee the advantage of that great Rule, <HI>Not to judge according to Appearances</HI>; e&s;pecially in things relating to Religion and common Life. As to Religion, 'tis well known how ha&s;tly Imaginations, or rather ha&s;ty Conclu&s;ions, bring all things into ca|lamity and ruin. And the bad effects of ra&s;h Judgment are no le&s;s &s;een in Life: we &s;ee others in a glittering &s;ituation, we im|mediately pronounce them <HI>Happy:</HI> and by a natural con&s;equence think our&s;elves mi&s;e|rable, if we have not the like Finery. <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> makes <HI>Fungo&s;o</HI> faint away, upon &s;eeing another Beau get into the Fa&s;hion be|fore him. The &s;ame &s;ort of judging obtains in hou&s;hold Furniture, Equipage, and Titles. 'Tis true, it may be call'd <HI>Staring</HI> rather than <HI>Judging,</HI> when we have no other Stan|dard of Felicity but to gape and admire with the Mob,<Q>Qui &s;tupet in Titulis&mdash;</Q> But &s;uch is really the ca&s;e, and &s;uch in|fluence has Imagination both on private Quiet and the publick, that the want of a Rib|bon may endanger a Government.

other &s;ource can it proceed, that a Man in perfect Health is not ea&s;y to travel the length of a Street, unle&s;s he have a Coach? and that another is not ea&s;y in a very fine Coach, becau&s;e it has not a Coronet?</P>

<P>'TIS this Faculty of Imagination, however, that makes the greate&s;t Figure in Life, e&s;pecially in Company, and &s;till more when there is a &s;tock of Memory along with it. 'Tis al&s;o the Work-hou&s;e of Poetry, and &s;ometimes of Politicks. Examples are need|le&s;s.</P>

which have no outward Re&s;emblance, nor Connection in Nature. Thus <HI>Butler</HI> &s;ays of his learned Champion,<Q><L>&mdash;He knew</L>

<P>IN &s;uch a jumble of Images, &s;ome Ridi|cule naturally falls upon one of the things for its being in company with the other. And &s;uch a merry burle&s;que Vein may be pretty allowable when it brings no contempt on Things or Per&s;ons that ought to be more re&s;pectfully treated: for in that ca&s;e it is like the hanging na&s;ty Rags upon a fine Sta|tue. Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> lays down &s;ome Regula|tions and Remarks with reference to this tickli&s;h Affair, which &s;hew the greatne&s;s of his Genius beyond many that have &s;ucceeded him, and which likewi&s;e &s;hew the un&s;ucce&s;s|fulne&s;s of any Genius, when it meddles in a deci&s;ive manner with things out of its reach. You may compare what he &s;ays in the eighth

Chapter of his <HI>Leviathan,</HI> with what he had &s;aid of the Cau&s;e of Sen&s;ation in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE &s;ecret Thoughts of a Man run over all things, holy, prophane, clean, ob&s;cene, grave, and light, without &s;hame or blame; which verbal Di&s;cour&s;e can|not do, farther than the Judgment &s;hall approve of the Time, Place, and Per&s;ons. An Anatomi&s;t, or a Phy&s;ician, may &s;peak or write his Judgment of unclean things [natural things] becau&s;e he is not to plea&s;e, but profit: but for another Man to write his extravagant and plea&s;ant Fancies of the &s;ame, is as if a Man, from being tumbled into the dirt, &s;hould come and pre&s;ent him&s;elf before good Company. And 'tis the want of Di&s;cretion that makes the difference. Again, in profe&s;t remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of Mind, and familiar Company, a Man may play with the Sounds and equivocal Signification of Words; and that many times with Encounters of extraordinary Fan|cy: but in a Sermon, or in publick, or be|fore Per&s;ons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no jingling of words that will not be accounted Folly: and the difference is only in the want of Di&s;cre|tion.

All poetical Compo&s;itions (whether in Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e, <HI>the Adventures of Telemachus,</HI> as well as the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or <HI>Aeneid</HI>) are Works of Wit and Judgment both, but are more properly referred to the Cla&s;s of Wit; be|cau&s;e of the Invention and Fancy that pre|vails in them. A Hi&s;tory is the pure work of Judgment and Memory.

<HEAD>VI. The PASSIONS.</HEAD>

<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE Force and Activity of the Soul appears much more in the Pa&s;&s;ions than in the bodily Sen&s;es, which are but pa&s;&s;ive and languid in compari&s;on of tho&s;e violent Commotions, or even in compari&s;on of the more gentle Affections. When the Pa&s;&s;ions break loo&s;e, they are like Hurricanes and Eruptions of Fire: and they are fitly call'd Pa&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e we &s;uffer under their Dominion. But then, as they are bad Ma&s;ters, they are excellent Ser|vants; as we u&s;e to &s;ay of Fire and Water: and without Pa&s;&s;ions, Life would be a very in&s;ipid thing. For let us &s;uppo&s;e a Man po&s;&s;e&s;t of a Fortune &s;ufficient to give him all the Gratifications of the Sen&s;es, and that in the mo&s;t elegant way imaginable: let him have Rago&ucirc;ts and Burgundy, and Dogs and Hor|&s;es, and what el&s;e he has a mind for: yet if we &s;uppo&s;e him in the bare &s;tate of Sen&s;uality, without Love and Friend&s;hip; no de&s;ire of Knowledge, no reli&s;h of giving or receiving Obligations, neither &s;atisfaction in Virtue, nor indignation at Vice: &s;uch a Man would be reckon'd by mo&s;t People to pa&s;s his time very dully.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">
ON the other hand, let us &s;uppo&s;e a Man heartily animated with one &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;ion, it will keep him at lea&s;t awake; and the pro|&s;pect of &s;atisfying it, will be to him in&s;tead of the mo&s;t delicious Sen&s;ualities, and &s;ome|times in&s;tead of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life.</P>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is &s;ometimes reckon'd, the &s;tronger the Pa&s;&s;ions are, the better, provided they are under due Regulations. <HI>Be angry, and &s;in not.</HI> But this I &s;uppo&s;e can mean only a vigorous Con&s;titution of Soul, to love heartily what we ought to love, and to hate heartily what we ought to hate. For there mu&s;t be an Exception as to &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;uch Forms of them as can produce no good effect. For in&s;tance, Fear and Revenge: the latter is diabolical, and the former often very ba&s;e. Such a Fear I mean, as is &s;aid to give a body to our Imaginations, to di&s;con|cert our mo&s;t valuable Faculties; and which may be called an Alienation of Mind while it la&s;ts: and &s;uch a Fear al&s;o as makes us re|cede from any Duty that would expo&s;e us to the Cen&s;ure of the unthinking World. Such Pa&s;&s;ions we had better wi&s;h extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE Pa&s;&s;ions, you know, are al&s;o called Affections of the Soul: for tho' Affection is taken particularly for Love (which word too has its different &s;ignifications) yet Affec|tion or Pa&s;&s;ion denotes any Motion or
<PB N="46" REF="57">
Feeling, whether agreeable or di&s;agreeable. And thus the Pa&s;&s;ions are commonly divi|ded into the <HI>concupi&s;cible</HI> and the <HI>ira&s;cible,</HI> two old-fa&s;hion'd words, but which intimate to us that all the various and <HI>variable</HI> Mo|tions of the Soul turn upon the&s;e two Hin|ges, <HI>De&s;ire</HI> and <HI>Aver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Divi&s;ion of our Pa&s;&s;ions, or fetch|ing them from two Sources, gives indeed no Idea either of Virtue or Vice; but only a general notion of Plea&s;ure and Pain in the Soul, without any con&s;ideration of Merit or Demerit: &s;o that there had need to be ano|ther Divi&s;ion of the Pa&s;&s;ions, into the <HI>Vir|tuous</HI> and <HI>Vicious.</HI> But becau&s;e this way of cla&s;&s;ing them would be <HI>in&s;ignificant</HI> to tho&s;e, who will not allow the di&s;tinction of Virtue and Vice; it will be enough to di|vide them into the <HI>Social</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions, and the <HI>Selfi&s;h,</HI> or the <HI>Di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> and the <HI>Inte|re&s;ted.</HI> 'Tis true, tho&s;e Per&s;ons will not al|low there is &s;uch a thing as Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s neither: but they'll at lea&s;t allow there is &s;uch a thing as Compa&s;&s;ion, Tenderne&s;s, Kindne&s;s, (they may chu&s;e their word) and &s;o the Pa&s;&s;ions might be di&s;tingui&s;hed into the <HI>Kind</HI> and <HI>Unkind,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e would pa&s;s current with all the World: &s;ince the greate&s;t Advocates for <HI>Self-Love</HI> do not deny that Men can be friendly, but only affirm that their Friend&s;hip is founded upon their own Intere&s;t.</P>

<P>I think this may be &s;aid too, that as De&s;ire and Aver&s;ion (e&s;pecially when they come the length of Pa&s;&s;ion) imply Want, Unea&s;ine&s;s, Trouble, and violent Motion in the Soul; &s;o Joy is the Satisfaction, Delight, and Acquie&s;cence that en&s;ues on our meeting with our De&s;ires, or even on getting free of our Aver&s;ions. Joy is to the Soul what Plea&s;ure is to the Sen&s;es: (and Sorrow may be called its Pain) with this difference, that true Joy and Sorrow of the rational Soul are &s;till founded upon Rea&s;on. And in all the Pa&s;&s;ions the Will has &s;ome more power than in the bodily Feelings, which we cannot augment nor le&s;&s;en: the greate&s;t <HI>Stoick</HI> mu&s;t feel the Gout; the mo&s;t ab&s;temious Reclu&s;e cannot put a &s;top to his <HI>Ta&s;ting,</HI> while the Gla&s;s is at his mouth. Whereas in the Pa&s;&s;ions or Feelings of the Soul, a Man can either cheri&s;h them, and con&s;equently rai&s;e them higher, or he can make &s;ome Efforts again&s;t them, and we &s;ee they die the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>SIMPLE De&s;ire, and &s;imple Aver&s;ion, are ju&s;tly reckon'd blind. And if Fancy may be &s;aid to enter often into our De&s;ires, it enters yet oftner into our Aver&s;ions: for we can generally give a better Rea&s;on why we like, than why we di&s;like. So that ma|ny of our Aver&s;ions are much owing to &s;ome di&s;order in our&s;elves, or our being <HI>out of</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="59">
<HI>Tune</HI>; which appears remarkably in tho&s;e Aver&s;ions and Di&s;gu&s;ts that are per&s;onal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Hope and Fear i&s;&s;ue from De&s;ire and Aver&s;ion, according to the Views, or the Apprehen&s;ions which the Mind hath of meeting with things agreeable or vexatious. Hope and Fear therefore are &s;uppos'd to be attended with &s;ome rea&s;on: the <HI>pannick</HI> Fear excepted as before, becau&s;e it concludes the dreadful thing to be already pre&s;ent. Our Hopes &s;eldom impo&s;e &s;o far upon us: tho' they ri&s;e very high, and from very narrow Foundations in &s;ome Tempers, and not the wor&s;t ones neither. But if we con&s;ider Hope as a rational Expectation of the Mind, it will rather come under the Li&s;t of the Virtues than of the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE natural Fear of Death is wi&s;ely im|planted in us, for the Pre&s;ervation of our bodily Frame: and neither the fear of Death nor of Pain is &s;hameful, unle&s;s it make us &s;hun what we ought to do, or do what we ought to &s;hun. Luxury and &s;oft Living mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e Fear, and magnify Dan|ger: as 'tis told of an hone&s;t Gentleman, who thought to have join'd King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but could not re&s;olve to lie out of his own Bed.</P>

<P>LIBERTY, no doubt, is a pure Gift from Heaven: and in all Creatures it is only a Power to u&s;e their Faculties for the Purpo&s;es they were given.

<P>IN rational Creatures, Liberty mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed not only as a Foundation of
<PB N="60" REF="71">
Virtue, but of Rea&s;on it&s;elf: &s;ince the nice&s;t Engine in the World cannot be &s;aid to act rationally, nor &s;o much as to act <HI>freely.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobbes,</HI> indeed, propo&s;es to reconcile Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity by the Compari&s;on of a River which is &s;aid to run freely when nothing hinders its cour&s;e. But this is mere playing with words. A River will hardly be called a <HI>free Agent:</HI> and I think it may be affirm'd, that tho&s;e who make <HI>Self-Love</HI> the &s;ole Spring, or Motive, of human Actions, allow no more Liberty to a Man than to a River. There is only this diffe|rence of <HI>Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> between them, the one knows what it is doing, the other not: but both are under a like <HI>overbearing unvir|tuous</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<P>ANOTHER Term for Liberty is <HI>Free-Will,</HI> which imports no more than a freedom of Choice. But &s;ometimes People confound the Will with the Inclinations; and the&s;e having &s;o much the upperhand in us, 'tis no wonder if Liberty is ab&s;olutely deny'd. But as we do many things from our Inclinations, &s;o we do many things again&s;t them; but can &s;trictly be &s;aid to do nothing again&s;t our will.</P>

<P>THE unhappy Di&s;putes concer|ning Liberty being rather with reference to things moral than natural, it might help to &s;horten them, if it were referred to every man's Brea&s;t, <HI>whether in any thing he ever did that was wrong, he could not have done otherwi&s;e?</HI> Unle&s;s this Que&s;tion be

<P>The&s;e two words <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> ill under&s;tood, have helped to perplex Men in their di&s;putes upon Liberty and other Sub|jects.

A Stone goes to the bottom, whil&s;t a piece of Wood floats above: the Fire melts Metals, hardens the Clay, and reduces Wood to a&s;hes: and <HI>Nature</HI> is ano|ther word for this Con&s;titution of things.

<P>HITHERTO we have chiefly con&s;ider'd Human Nature with reference to the Sen&s;es and Affections, ac|cording to that Divi&s;ion of <HI>Body, Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>; the la&s;t of which I will be glad to have your opinion of. For tho' the Soul is often taken for the highe&s;t thing that can be &s;uppo&s;ed in Man, and is to be con&s;idered as an <HI>immortal thinking</HI> Principle, of an in|expre&s;&s;ible Activity, and of a quite different <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> from unactive life|le&s;s Matter; yet according to the Plan a|bove mentioned, there is a &s;uperiour Region in Man, called indifferently by the Philo&s;o|phers <HI>Mind, Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>governing Part:</HI> and what they call Spirit, St. <HI>Paul</HI> takes in a higher &s;en&s;e &s;till.</P>

<P>HERE is my Opinion without cere|mony. In the Body it&s;elf mention is made of three Regions, the <HI>Belly,</HI> the <HI>Brea&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Head</HI>; which bears &s;ome analogy to the Sen&s;es, the Affections, and the Under&s;tand|ing. But as there is no fix'd Standard for mo&s;t words, &s;ometimes the <HI>Heart,</HI> and &s;ome|times the <HI>Bowels,</HI> is made u&s;e of, to &s;ignify tho&s;e Sentiments of Tenderne&s;s and Pity, and al&s;o the Seat of them; the <HI>Head</HI> being
<PB N="70" REF="81">
generally taken for the Seat of the Judg|ment, as well as for the Judgment it &s;elf.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the&s;e three Regions in the Body, the Plea&s;ures are generally cla&s;|&s;ed, and denominated. Tho&s;e of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> be|ing the lowe&s;t, are &s;ent down to the Belly: <HI>who&s;e God is their Belly,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and he gives a Character of the Inhabitants of <HI>Crete</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <BIBL>Tit. 1. 12.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> from one of them&s;elves. The <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> God of Plea&s;ure is al&s;o repre&s;ented like a di&s;mal Creature, all Belly. But the&s;e Re|pre&s;entations and Expre&s;&s;ions are only figu|rative, and not de&s;ign'd to be taken accor|ding to the preci&s;e Letter. The Plea&s;ure of the Ta&s;te it &s;elf is far from the Belly. The Plea&s;ure of the Eye has yet le&s;s connection with it; &s;o that the Epithet of the <HI>Cretians</HI> &s;eems de&s;ign'd to expre&s;s their Luxury in general, tho' perhaps they have been parti|cularly remarkable for eating and drinking.</P>
<P>MEAN-TIME the Body, which we &s;tu|dy to &s;oak in Plea&s;ure like a Sponge, is of it &s;elf but a mere dead Husk, and drops off at la&s;t: and a Man reckons upon it no farther, than as a Machine for bringing him Plea&s;ure, and would &s;ometimes be content to change it for another Body, if he could, and does often wear it out before its natu|ral period.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="82">
BUT to come to the highe&s;t Region in Man. The Mind, or Under&s;tanding, is con|&s;ider'd as a Principle of Light or Di&s;cerning; as the Sen&s;es and Affections are &s;uppo&s;ed to be blind. The Mind &s;ees the Order and Value of Things, their Relations, and Pro|perties; and this either by immediate Intui|tion, like the bodily Eye, or by a &s;ort of Proce&s;s, which con&s;iders one thing after ano|ther; and &s;o is called both <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI></P>

we judge thus coolly on &s;ome occa|&s;ions.

<P>TAKING Rea&s;on therefore only for the natural Light of the Mind, we may well enough conclude, that natural Truths, or Principles, belong to it, as vi&s;ible Objects belong to the Eye.

<P>WE may likewi&s;e &s;ee how Faith is taken in different Sen&s;es: one acceptation of it is Tru&s;t, Confidence, Dependence; another acceptation is Hone&s;ty and Fair-dealing, <HI>bona fides.</HI> But the acceptation relating mo&s;t to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, is that <HI>Divine Convic|tion of the Under&s;tanding,</HI> whereby we can|not refu&s;e our a&s;&s;ent. And tho' <HI>we &s;ee but through a gla&s;s darkly,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, (and how few &s;ee like him!) yet the lea&s;t remove from Infidelity is a kind of Faith: and if there is but an <HI>hone&s;t Heart</HI> to receive it into, it will grow like <HI>the greate&s;t Trees</HI> from <HI>the lea&s;t of Seeds.</HI> Nor is a Man to be di&s;couraged if he does not perceive its growth; and even tho' he &s;hould think he had no Faith at all.

But to &s;ay the truth, mo&s;t people are in the contrary &s;tate, rather inclin'd to think their Faith greater than it is, than le&s;s: and &s;uch Per&s;ons would do well to con&s;ider what Faith is, and examine their own by St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Definition, who calls it <HI>the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not &s;een.</HI> We

<P>BUT as to the Compari&s;on of Faith and Rea&s;on; when they are con&s;idered as two Lights of the Mind, the principal dif|ference between them &s;eems to be with re|lation to their Objects. <HI>The natural Man receiveth not the things of God.</HI> This <HI>na|tural Man</HI> is not denied by the Apo&s;tle to have the Faculty of Rea&s;on: but for all that, <HI>the things of God are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him</HI>; and he adds, <HI>neither can he know them, be|cau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> There mu&s;t be another Faculty therefore in Man for knowing the Things of God, whatever Term be u&s;ed to expre&s;s it; and &s;o the Spi|rit of Man may be &s;aid to receive intelli|gence from the Spirit of God, concerning &s;uch things as his natural Under&s;tanding is not capable of.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not indeed wi&s;h to add to the number of our Faculties: &s;ince it were the &s;ame thing, as to our Happine&s;s, whether we

had many or but one, if that one could per|form all the Offices of the re&s;t. So if it be alledged that what is called <HI>Divine Illumi|nation</HI> is nothing but the making <HI>new</HI> Di&s;|coveries to the <HI>old</HI> natural Under&s;tanding; I &s;hould readily enough give up the Argu|ment, if it were own'd that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for Man to make tho&s;e Di&s;coveries him|&s;elf: but then I know not what to make of tho&s;e expre&s;s words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> above men|tion'd, who&s;e words the Clergy at lea&s;t will grant me are not to go for nothing.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Rea&s;on be confin'd to natural Knowledge, its province is &s;till very exten|&s;ive: it can examine &s;everal things concern|ing Revelation it &s;elf; for in&s;tance, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was meant of things propo&s;ed to our Belief by others.

<P>NOT only are the Objects of our Fa|culties to be reckon'd Gifts from our Crea|tor, but the Faculties them&s;elves are Gifts.

Love always &s;uppo&s;es an Union with, or a de&s;ire after &s;ome other thing than the Subject that loves; &s;o that, Self-Love would be found an Impropriety, if one had a mind to quarrel with common Expre&s;&s;ions. For what is it that a Man calls <HI>Self,</HI> or <HI>Him|&s;elf,</HI> but a Creature endued with certain Appetites, De&s;ires, Qualities, or whatever they may be called? And what can he make of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> without Objects adapted and pro|portion'd to his Wants? Again, what can he owe to him&s;elf farther than Care and Be|nevolence, which every animated Creature,
<PB N="95" REF="106">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, has a &s;hare of; and in which there is nothing to be blamed or prai&s;ed? If it be &s;aid, a Man owes him&s;elf Re|&s;pect; this is not as he is &s;uch a particular Per|&s;on, but as he is one of the Human Species: and he had be&s;t take care not to think too often of his particular Qualifications, le&s;t they appear to him greater than they do to others, and make him al&s;o overlook his Defects.</P>

<P>THE Dignity of Man appears con|&s;picuou&s;ly in the Power of Loving, and in the Object that can only &s;atisfy his Love: if it center'd in him&s;elf, it would be wretchedly directed, and no acquie&s;cence could en&s;ue. The lower Appetites are &s;atisfied for a time: the Belly being full, demands no more till the Dige&s;tion is over, and the Fibres of the Stomach irritated anew. It is not &s;o with the Eye and the Ear, as <HI>Solomon</HI> informs us; nor with the Mind neither, for it mu&s;t be con&s;tantly amu&s;ed with new Di&s;coveries and
<PB N="97" REF="108">
Tales: there is a Fund of Curio&s;ity in Man, or a De&s;ire of knowing, which mu&s;t be &s;a|tisfied one way or other; &s;o that Knowledge may be called the Food of the Under&s;tanding.</P>

<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>NATURAL Affection, Love, and Friend&s;hip are &s;atisfied by the Solaces and Endearments proper to the Soul and Body; and were it not for the &s;elfi&s;h Principle, many of our Satisfactions would be much greater than they are. 'Tis true, the broken State of things makes all our Enjoyments very uncertain, and we often find our &s;elves unexpectedly bereaved and de&s;olate. But if the highe&s;t Faculty in Man were exerted, or, which is much the &s;ame, if his Love were principally directed to the highe&s;t Object, perfect Satisfaction would readily follow; at lea&s;t Man would be in the State of Order, and where he &s;hould be: if divine Con&s;o|lations were denied or &s;u&s;pended, it would be but for a while, and the re&s;ign'd Soul would have Contentment in the Divine Will, whatever De&s;ertion or Pain it might &s;uffer. The bearing our natural Afflictions is recommended upon the &s;ame Principle.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be own'd, this State of Mind, in which God is loved for him&s;elf, is not at pre&s;ent natural, like our other de&s;ires: we naturally love created things, or de&s;ire them for our Convenience; but the Love of the Creator may be call'd a &s;tranger to us: it

<P>MOST certainly. Mean time in this Review of Man, the Di&s;tinction of Body, Soul, and Spirit, may &s;till be had recour&s;e to; or the Sen&s;es, the Affections, and the Under&s;tanding. This la&s;t is called the go|verning Part by <HI>Antoninus,</HI> who makes little account of the inferiour Powers, as being in common with the Bea&s;ts. He makes a kind of Diffection of &s;ome Plea|&s;ures (perhaps a little too far) and &s;peaks of them with di&s;paragement. But every Sen|&s;ation, as well as every Motion of the Soul, is &s;urprizing to think of. Even Smelling, which is counted the mo&s;t frivolous of all the Sen&s;es, is of more u&s;e than we can ima|gine; and in fact we &s;ee it can rai&s;e the Spirits as it were by Magick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis generally in favour of the Sen&s;es that the Pa&s;&s;ions are exerted; the&s;e are a|larm'd and ri&s;e in arms, when our Plea&s;ures are <HI>in danger.</HI> It belongs to the Under|&s;tanding to regulate the Pa&s;&s;ions or Affec|tions; or, in other words, to keep the Plea|&s;ures in order: for it cannot alter our Sen|&s;ations or Feelings. And if it be &s;aid that the Under&s;tanding, which is but pa&s;&s;ive it &s;elf, like the bodily Eye, cannot be called the Leader of the re&s;t of the Faculties; it mu&s;t be granted, that (&s;trictly &s;peaking) it
<PB N="99" REF="110">
is rather the Light than the Guide: for if we con&s;ider it in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apprehen&s;io, Judicium, Di&s;cur&s;us.</HI></NOTE>three Operations mention'd by the Logicians, 'tis &s;till but one Light operating in three different manners. The governing Power therefore mu&s;t be &s;omething of Life, Force, and Activity, which &s;ets all the other Faculties at work; and tho' the Will is a more vital Principle than the Under&s;tanding and the Memory, the Spirit may be con&s;ider'd as &s;omewhat &s;uperiour to the Will it &s;elf, &s;ince the &s;ame Per&s;on may have a very different Will at different times. Sometimes the Will is ma|nageable, &s;ometimes ob&s;tinate; a Man will not &s;o much as hearken: What is it that makes him reflect and yield? Sometimes the Per&s;ua&s;ion is addre&s;s'd to the Under&s;tand|ing, &s;ometimes to the Heart; and Intreaty commonly prevails more than Rea&s;oning. The Memory is only applied to as a Regi&s;ter.</P>

<P>SHALL we &s;ay then, that there is a fir&s;t Mover within us, a Mind, Rector, or pre&s;iding Faculty over the re&s;t? Indeed we may be indifferent what is concluded in &s;uch Speculations, for it will not alter the &s;tate of the things. People frequently do &s;peak of &s;uch a leading Principle, and of a Spirit in Man: and then this Spirit is as fre|quently denominated, or receives its Cha|racter, from any Quality that appears mo&s;t prevailing, not only with regard to the mo|ral
<PB N="100" REF="111">
Di&s;po&s;itions, but even the Complexion, Temper, Genius, and whatever is mo&s;t ob|&s;ervable in the Per&s;on: thus we &s;ay, a <HI>proud Spirit,</HI> a <HI>violent Spirit,</HI> an <HI>active Spirit,</HI> and many other kinds of Spirits (&s;ome bet|ter, &s;ome wor&s;e) that are to be met with in the world.</P>

<P>To a&s;&s;ert the Superiority of the Hu|man Spirit (or if it &s;hall only be called the Human Nature) above that of other Ani|mals upon this earth, has been the endea|vour of many Per&s;ons, who (I cannot but think) have made their Sy&s;tem more cohe|rent than tho&s;e who have endeavour'd to put Men and Bea&s;ts upon a level. Some of this la&s;t Party indeed acknowledge the ad|vantage that Mankind have from the Frame of the Body and its Organs, which they pre|tend makes all the difference. But what Texture of the Brain is &s;ufficient to perform all the various Operations they a&s;&s;ign to it, Sen&s;ation, Reflection, Wi&s;hing, Loving, Ha|ting? Of what figure are the Cells for Po|etry, and tho&s;e for Mathematicks? And what Lodgings of the Brain are Hone&s;ty and Knavery to be found in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHATEVER Sen&s;ations and Pow|ers inferiour Creatures may be endued with, the bodily Organs are but the In&s;truments of their Operations; and it mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing even within them, that &s;ets tho&s;e En|gines

a going. The Bee and the Elephant have little re&s;emblance of each other in their outward figure, and there may be &s;up|po&s;ed as little in the <HI>Texture of their Brain:</HI> but each performs very remarkable things; for which there had need to be recour&s;e to &s;ome inward Principle actuating their diffe|rent Machines.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame Conclu&s;ion holds as to Man: whatever is perform'd in him, bate|ing &s;ome Actions called Vital, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the Heart and other inward Parts, is pro|perly the Action of the Soul upon the Body, and the Change is fir&s;t made within; the Soul is touched before the Blood flu&s;hes out in the Face, to proclaim either Ba&s;hfulne&s;s or Anger: and the Notion of a <HI>Contact,</HI> and <HI>reciprocal Action</HI> betwixt the Soul and the Body, is but a way of &s;peaking; for if it were &s;trictly true, the Soul would depend as much on the Body, as the Body does upon it; or rather, all would be reduced to Bo|dy, according to <HI>Lucretius:</HI><Q><L>Tangere enim &amp; tangi &s;ine corpore nulla pote&s;t res.</L></Q> The truer Philo&s;ophy &s;eems to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Body is touch'd, the Soul feels.</NOTE><HI>tangitur Corpus, &s;entit Anima.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="113">
'TIS pretty evident the Soul moves the Body, as the Hand moves the Glove; but that the Body moves the Soul, is not evi|dent. If they &s;ay Mu&s;ick &s;trikes the Soul, and rai&s;es different Pa&s;&s;ions, and Mu&s;ick is Sound, and Sound is Body; and therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it may be granted that bare Sen&s;ation is excited by the means of bodily things, as all Sounds make impre&s;&s;ion upon the Hear|ing: but in Mu&s;ick you know all Ears are not equally affected, &s;ome People only hear|ing the bare Sound, without being &s;en&s;ible of the Harmony, and &s;o are &s;aid to have no Ear. Much le&s;s is it mere Sound that rai&s;es any Pa&s;&s;ion in us, but &s;ome other thing that we have no name for; as it is not mere Words that touch the Heart, even in friend|ly Expre&s;&s;ions, but the Per&s;ua&s;ion we have of &s;ome Friend&s;hip de&s;ign'd by them, com|mon Compliments affecting us but little.</P>
<P>BUT in all this, they'll &s;ay, the Superio|rity of Man does not appear, the Bea&s;ts hav|ing Sen&s;ations and Pa&s;&s;ions as well as He: a Dog or a Hor&s;e is &s;en&s;ible of a kind Word and a gentle Stroak.</P>

<P>WE &s;ee therefore that Pride, which may be called the elde&s;t Daughter of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> has &s;till a more ample dominion than either Covetou&s;ne&s;s or Sen&s;uality: it enters into the private&s;t Hou&s;es, it breaks the clo&s;e&s;t Tyes: Covetou&s;ne&s;s divides Friends, but Pride divides nearer Friends.</P>

<P>THE difference between Pride and Vanity is &s;een in the different appearances of Men; and &s;ometimes by their appearances we may know what they have mo&s;t at heart.

<PB N="117" REF="128">
of which it may be called the Parent.

<P>'TIS a more &s;hameful Ulcer of the Soul than Jealou&s;y, and more vi&s;ibly the ef|fect of Pride; and the more unaccountable, that it grieves at the good of another, when we our &s;elves lo&s;e nothing by it.

<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe we are at no le&s;s pains to conceal our Hypocri&s;y, tho' it is a more voluntary thing, and all over art and de|&s;ign rather than infirmity; and having a more exten&s;ive view than Envy, it runs more through our whole Life and Actions.</P>

<P>WE know how things &s;tand at pre&s;ent with regard to Man, all his Faculties, the Earth he treads on, and the Elements that &s;erve him, and often ma&s;ter him.

<P>IT may be granted to the <HI>&s;evere</HI> Men, that whatever is the bare re&s;ult of Complexion is no Virtue; 'tis but a mecha|nical &s;ort of thing, nor can it be called Vice neither, as being but a tendency of Nature to its Relief or Plea&s;ure, without any reflec|tion of the Mind upon the <HI>Moral</HI> Good or Evil.

of Cha&s;tity, as if it were their greate&s;t Diffi|culty and Trouble; whereas Men have much more to &s;truggle with of that kind, and in|dulge them&s;elves without much blame from the World. The Sex are at another lo&s;s in that way of reckoning, they are tempted to believe this &s;ingle Virtue may give them a di&s;pen&s;ation from ob&s;erving all the re&s;t.

<P>I differ very much from them. But &s;uppo&s;e it were yielded; the Con&s;equences would not be &s;o dangerous, if it were con|&s;ider'd that whatever we have that's good is <HI>free Gift,</HI> and that of our &s;elves we cannot think a good Thought, no more than we can keep our &s;elves in Life and Health. The only Que&s;tion is, whether we are not born with &s;ome Tendencies to Virtue as well as to Vice? I ventur'd to &s;ay above, that there is &s;till &s;ome Hone&s;ty and &s;ome Friend&s;hip in the World, which &s;ome of the Advocates for Self-Love do not deny, maintaining only that 'tis all for our own ends: but I would beg leave to put the following Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>MAY not a Judge give a ju&s;t &s;entence without any view to Applau&s;e, or any fear of Cen&s;ure? He may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that his Name &s;hall ne|ver be heard of; and his belief of a future State can likewi&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to be very lit|tle,
<PB N="138" REF="149">
or nothing. May not a Merchant give up a fair Account, when he might give up a wrong one without all po&s;&s;ibility of Di&s;|covery? We can &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame of all Tru&s;|tees, and who&s;e Belief may be &s;ometimes of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Judge's. So much for Hone&s;ty in dealing. Then may not a Man eat and drink moderately and unexpen|&s;ively, from a better motive than <HI>the Fear of being &s;ick,</HI> or for &s;aving his Money? And, to &s;uppo&s;e a greater Temptation, may he not ab&s;tain from violating the tendere&s;t Right of another, when he might encroach with all the &s;afety imaginable to his own Per&s;on? It were hard if the &s;ame favourable Suppo|&s;ition could not be made for the Sex, as if the Fear of Di&s;covery were their only Re|&s;traint. Have not they the &s;ame Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and a much greater Sen&s;e of Mo|de&s;ty, implanted in their Nature? But to talk of our&s;elves, if a Man had two Women in his power, and equally charming, but the one free, and the other not; it were a &s;trange perver&s;ene&s;s to go <HI>deliberately</HI> to his Neighbour's Property, merely for the &s;ake of encroaching. It was <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Opinion, <HI>that if Right was to be violated, it was only to be for the &s;ake of a Crown:</HI> which &s;hews a natural tendency to Ju&s;tice when there is no temptation to the contrary; and I &s;hall ea&s;ily grant that Men are overcome with very &s;mall temptations. But it is enough in the pre&s;ent Enquiry, if it can be &s;aid that
<PB N="139" REF="150">
they would naturally go the &s;traight Road, if there was nothing to allure and &s;educe them. Even when we are deceiv'd 'tis under &s;ome &s;pecious appearance or other; <HI>decipimur &s;pe|cie Recti</HI>&mdash;So that if we &s;hould allow that a Man might be &s;o perver&s;e as to wrong his Neighbour in the point already mention'd, we may &s;uppo&s;e him to have been previou&s;ly deluded by fal&s;e Ideas of Glory and Gal|lantry; he has imagin'd it <HI>a pretty thing</HI> to break thro' all Laws, 'tis a &s;ort of Conque&s;t too, and he can talk of Favours he has ob|tain'd, and of more than he has obtain'd.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems when the Springs of Acti|ons are laid open, it will be found that 'tis Vanity or the Love of Glory which deter|mines Men, rather than the Love of pure Vice, or the doing Ill for Ill's &s;ake. If it be &s;aid, that Men in their hone&s;t Actions are nei|ther determin'd by Ill nor Good, but by mere Chance; this word has nothing in it that can make it to be the motive of any Action what&s;oever. And when we &s;ee Men acting in the &s;ame uniform way, as we have &s;uppo|&s;ed in the Ca&s;e of your hone&s;t Accountant, it may be fairly concluded that the natural Love of Hone&s;ty, which al&s;o implies an ab|horrence of Roguery, is the determining Principle, tho' it may not be much reflected on by the Per&s;on him&s;elf.</P>

<P>AS to Friend&s;hip, it will perhaps be alledged, there are &s;o many endearing things in it, that we are ready to do good Offices to our Friends becau&s;e we are fond of their Per&s;ons; &s;o that in this affection there can be no Virtue: a Man would not cheat his Friend, no more than he would cheat his Son, becau&s;e he loves him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that where there is true Friend&s;hip there is &s;urety enough for fair dealing, and all the good that can be done be&s;ides; Love is the &s;tronge&s;t of all tyes.

<P>I believe 'tis difficult to determine whether Men are more capable of Hone&s;ty or of Friend&s;hip: both are comprehended in Virtue, and both &s;eem to be natural. But Men differ from one another very much in their Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions; &s;ome are &s;trictly hone&s;t to all, but very limited in their Affection. If the Benignity be uni|ver&s;al, it will draw Hone&s;ty along with it:
<PB N="141" REF="152">
but the contrary cannot be affirmed. How|ever, Virtue in general may &s;o far be &s;aid to be <HI>innate,</HI> or of our own growth, (let the Word pa&s;s) that all the In&s;tances of it are plea&s;ant to hear of, Friend&s;hip and all other Sentiments of Humanity, Ju&s;tice and all that falls under the Idea of Honour; &s;ome of which Sentiments are upon occa&s;ions actu|ally exerted in Minds corrupt enough, good Offices are hone&s;tly done; and perhaps none are born &s;o very corrupt, as not to wi&s;h they could do better. The Under&s;tanding &s;ees very often what is right: if the Will follows it but &s;eldom, there are at lea&s;t Intervals of regret, and a Man is angrier with him&s;elf than with all the World.</P>

<P>HAD not the Author of our Nature implanted in us &s;ome tendency to Virtue, we might have had ground to complain of our unhappy Con&s;titution and of his Seve|rity (greater than that of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Task|ma&s;ters) in requiring &s;o much, and furni&s;hing &s;o little. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book III.</NOTE><HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays,<Q><L>&mdash;yet once more he &s;hall &s;tand</L>

If we have &s;ometimes a plea&s;ure in doing good, and the kind Affec|tions &s;tir in us, we too often find what may be called <HI>unkind</HI> Affections; we are affected with Anger and Re&s;entment, and feel a &s;ort of joy in pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e unhappy Mo|tions. Man's Heart is compar'd to a Seed-plot, where very oppo&s;ite things &s;pring up toge|ther, and the wor&s;t Plants need no cultiva|tion; as the be&s;t and tendere&s;t are brought up with difficulty, and &s;oon choaked.</P>

<P>IT would be &s;trange, I think, if a Man of capacity to under&s;tand the meaning of that Rule could really want a Rea&s;on for

ob&s;erving it. It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed he has &s;ome Notion of Right and Wrong, or he can ne|ver &s;ee the Obligation of any moral Rule, let it be put in any Shape or Terms what|&s;oever. If he has any Notion then or Sen&s;e of Equity, his Friend the Propo&s;er can have &s;ome acce&s;s to his Mind, and will be able to make out the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of that Rule to him in &s;ome other form of words more adapted to the &s;lowne&s;s of his apprehen&s;ion; for the Defect mu&s;t be only there. The Principle is innate, only a particular Propo|&s;ition may not chance to be a&s;&s;ented to on the fir&s;t hearing; or there may be no innate Idea of a moral Propo&s;ition, any more than of a mathematical one, before the fir&s;t hearing, and even not 'till certain &s;teps are made for getting at the bottom of it. But as to that &s;acred Rule of doing as we would be done unto, 'tis highly probable, that having been given by the Saviour of the World, and &s;po|ken to the &s;imple&s;t Multitude, every Man will &s;ee the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it at a glance, and al&s;o wi&s;h (if he is not wholly abandon'd) to be able to put it in practice.</P>

<P>IT were a difficult Task to enquire in|to all the different Forms of Government, and much more to adju&s;t the Prerogatives and Privileges of the Governours and the Go|verned.

<P>BY the way, the Change of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ta&s;te is remarkable between the fir&s;t Ages of the Commonwealth and the Age in which <HI>Horace</HI> makes his Ob&s;ervation.

<P>PROPERTY being an exclu&s;ive Right to u&s;e and di&s;po&s;e of the Goods one has ac|quired, or is Ma&s;ter of for the time; it might be thought that when great E&s;tates are got, they would be kept for ever: but it &s;eems in the Cour&s;e of things there is a natural Ten|dency to Equality or a Level, as Heaps arti|ficially

<P>'TIS pity that People are &s;o ready to look with Contempt upon others of an inferior Rank, which I &s;u&s;pect they will do &s;till; but they would do well to reflect upon the Equality by Nature: tho' this may be

attended with &s;ome other Reflections a little unea&s;y; for if they once begin, (&s;uppo&s;ing Pride to keep a while out of the way) they will probably regret the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Fa&s;hion of the World, which has &s;eparated them from the great Body of Mankind, and &s;o has de|prived them of the Familiarity of &s;ome Per|&s;ons who would have made excellent Friends, had it not been for the Coar&s;ene&s;s of their Clothes. Marriage &s;uffers by this Confine|ment as well as Friend&s;hip, and the Choice in that State is &s;till more confined thro' par|ticular Views of Money or Alliance. 'Tis pity the Appearances of Good-Humour, (tho' &s;ometimes they are but Appearances) and the Reports of a good Education are &s;o much neglected. I believe I have been up|on this head before.</P>

<P>WE have as yet talked of the dif|ferent Characters among Mankind, chiefly with regard to their Fortunes, and 'tis the&s;e indeed which make their natural Characters appear more remarkably; &s;o that the &s;ame may be call'd natural and accidental both.</P>
<P>WITH reference to Religion: Every Body knows 'tis accident, for the mo&s;t part, that makes us of one Religion, rather than another. 'Tis either the Religion of our Parents, or the Religion of the Times; and our Parents &s;eem to have been deter|min'd the &s;ame way that we are. This is with reference to Forms and Sy&s;tems. Tho&s;e Defects and Blemi&s;hes in Religion, called <HI>Super&s;tition, Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and the like, are owing to the particular Temper of Per&s;ons, and not to the Sy&s;tem they e&s;pou&s;e: for we &s;hall find &s;ome of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion very warm, and others very indifferent.</P>
<P>THERE is hardly a Pamphlet comes out, that does not take notice of tho&s;e two Characters. Both the Super&s;titious and the Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, I believe, have a de&s;ign of plea&s;ing the Almighty, and the Enthu&s;ia&s;ts imagine they plea&s;e him better than they do: the Super&s;titious have more of Fear than Pride, and &s;o they are rigid Ob&s;ervers of little things, without which they think there is no Salvation. Both Characters may meet
<PB N="171" REF="182">
in the &s;ame Per&s;on, but 'tis the prevailing one that gives the Denomination. Enthu|&s;ia&s;m is apt to de&s;pi&s;e all Ob&s;ervances, Su|per&s;tition to magnify and multiply them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ae.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE Di&s;ea&s;e of Enthu&s;ia&s;m has more or le&s;s dangerous Effects, both for Society and the Per&s;ons them&s;elves, accord|ing to the Tempers it &s;eizes. If a Man who&s;e Pride is not exce&s;&s;ive &s;hould fancy him&s;elf in&s;pir'd, or cloathed with &s;ome ex|traordinary Commi&s;&s;ion from Heaven, the Government may be pretty &s;afe from his Attempts: but if one &s;hould think him&s;elf God's peculiar Favourite, and that his Com|mi&s;&s;ion was given him on account of his &s;ingular Merit, or even tho' his Fancy &s;hould not carry him to the Extremity of In&s;pira|tion, if he but thinks him&s;elf a peculiar Fa|vourite, it will be enough to make him &s;et up for temporal Dominion, and fight, (if he have Courage) like <HI>John of Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>BIGOTRY and Zeal may be call'd the Off&s;pring of Super&s;tition and Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>CARELESSNESS in Religion, is much the &s;ame as the having no Religion: it pro|ceeds partly from Stupidity, and partly from the Love of Plea&s;ure. The Contempt of Religion is chiefly from Pride, or the Love of Independency. Hence, 'tis ea&s;y to trace the Sources of Athei&s;m and Dei&s;m.</P>

<P>THE Labourers in the Field, and Trade&s;|men (Handy-crafts, Mechanicks, Artificers) generally work the mo&s;t part of the day; they eat their Meals with a good appetite, they &s;peak little, and &s;leep &s;ound.</P>

<P>THERE are certainly other In|ducements to Conver&s;ation than Vanity and Ill-nature. There is Curio&s;ity, Amu&s;e|ment and Friend&s;hip.

<P>HERE is a good deal of Scandal and many frivolous things cut off, and u&s;e|ful things in&s;i&s;ted on: but they would be too philo&s;ophical for mo&s;t Conver&s;ations. One mu&s;t often hear Stories of <HI>a Cock and a Bull,</HI> and talk of them too, with an Air of Contentment, when one cannot make better of it. 'Tis in familiar Conver&s;ation, and chiefly between two, that free Senti|ments can be exchang'd upon grave Subjects. In promi&s;cuous Company, &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t be avoided, le&s;t it &s;hould look like Cant, and give a Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT care mu&s;t be taken in familiar Chat, not to fall into Detraction, to which it mu&s;t be confe&s;t there is a natural Tendency, e|&s;pecially when two Heads are got together. This Whi&s;pering puts one in mind of the

On the other hand, who can take upon them to give formal Allowances, when they are not ab&s;olutely &s;ure but it may contradict the meaning of an Apo&s;tle? For St. <HI>Paul,</HI> after he had exhorted the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to ab|&s;tain from bad Actions and bad Di&s;cour&s;e, tells them how they ought to employ their time, to wit, <HI>in giving of Thanks</HI>; which agrees with the Directions of St. <HI>James, Is any of you afflicted? let him pray; is any chearful? let him &s;ing P&s;alms.</HI> But every body knows the&s;e Directions are not for common Conver&s;ation, wherein too great Gravity is to be avoided, as well as too great Liberty.

<P>THE mo&s;t allowable as well as agreeable kind of laughing, is that which proceeds from chearful Good-Humour: the Per&s;on that laughs is pleas'd, and no body offended; the Satisfaction even runs thro' the whole Company. On the other hand, the Laughter that proceeds from Contempt, argues a Di&s;turbance of Soul, and gives a quite different Air to the Countenance: 'tis really an Effect of the <HI>Spleen,</HI> Nature taking that way to relieve it &s;elf, tho' there is &s;omething involuntary in it too; the Fancy being touch'd unea&s;ily, not tickled.</P>

<P>A very di&s;agreeable kind al&s;o of laughing to the Beholders, is that which is affected, wherein the Fancy is not touched at all, and the Sides are only &s;haken artifi|cially, or rather aukwardly; as well as the Face is put in a fooli&s;h Set, without any Charm or Life: &s;uch is the Laughter of tho&s;e who &s;tudy to plea&s;e, Attendants upon <HI>Levees,</HI> Pages, Chamber-Maids, and many others.</P>

<P>IT were to make too great a Pane|gyrick upon Laughing, even the be&s;t &s;ort of it that can be imagin'd, to &s;ay that it gives the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure in Conver&s;ation; for People are truly better plea&s;ed, when the Under&s;tanding is well inform'd, than when the Imagination is tickled: and then a kind Word is more delightful than the greate&s;t Di&s;coveries of Speculation. The Under|&s;tanding and the Heart are very different Re|gions. Indeed in common Conver&s;ation a Laugh is the be&s;t Fruit we can propo&s;e to reap: but to be convinc'd there is no great

<P>IT &s;eems <HI>Sneering</HI> is meant both of &s;cornful laughing and &s;cornful &s;peaking, and is far from being a plea&s;ant Thing.

'Tis a &s;tand|ing Maxim, that every Man has his Whim and his Ridicule.

'Tis true, the Stage is &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful in the Cure: but it is at lea&s;t of &s;ome u&s;e to let People &s;ee the Follies of their Neighbours, and if they will not look <HI>at home,</HI> the Stage cannot help it.

<P>IF a Man were to con&s;ider for what End Life is given him, <HI>quidnam vic|turi gignimur,</HI> he would readily enquire after the Books that could direct him be&s;t. But in this he is apt to meet with very dif|ferent

Here is one fixt Point however, as to Books of Religion, all Par|ties of Chri&s;tendom acknowledge one Book, which is called <HI>the Bible,</HI> as the Standard of all Belief and Practice: and tho' it is called but one Book, yet it is a Collection of many, and has a Variety of Subjects, which I need not enumerate. There is al&s;o a Variety in the Style, according to the Cha|racter of the Writers. That Irony does not &s;ignify much, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Characteri&s;ticks</HI> III. 236.</NOTE>that in the Compo&s;ition <HI>there is nothing miraculous or &s;elf-convin|cing.

<P>BUT the deepe&s;t Objections are a|gain&s;t the Authority of tho&s;e &s;acred Books: I &s;hould have called them In&s;inuations ra|ther than Objections, for generally they are

nothing el&s;e; and where any Arguments have been really form'd again&s;t any parti|cular Book or &s;ingle Prophecy, they have been an&s;wered by very good hands, and the impartial Reader will judge who&s;e Argu|ments are the &s;tronge&s;t.

Let him dip in Commentaries and Sermons, and where-ever he thinks his weak Faith may be be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And tho' he may chance to think &s;ome of tho&s;e reli|gious Books a little heavy, he &s;hould not reject them all in a lump: for that which he may &s;uppo&s;e to be the Effect of his deli|cate Ta&s;te, may be in reality but the Weak|ne&s;s of his Appetite.

<PB N="194" REF="205">
that Dullne&s;s is confin'd to the Labours of the Pulpit, and Works of Divinity; &s;ince not only the Workmen for the Stage, who mu&s;t labour for their Bread, but even fine Gentlemen who might live at their ea&s;e, and yet labour for E&s;teem, do often pro|duce Works of great heavine&s;s. It is al&s;o to be con&s;ider'd in behalf of the Clergy, that they are &s;o limited to a few Topicks, and the&s;e often in&s;i&s;ted on, that their Fancy has little &s;cope to exert it &s;elf, in compa|ri&s;on of the Authors who&s;e aim is Ridi|cule, and &s;ometimes Ribaldry, (things that rarely do well in a Sermon;) and &s;o they who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion is Seriou&s;ne&s;s, mu&s;t be at a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and therefore ought to have the Allowances that Ju&s;tice requires.</P>

<P>AFTER Books that treat expre&s;&s;ly of Religion, tho&s;e of Morality have the next place.

<P>MORALS and Divinity are by no means to be &s;eparated.

Not to &s;ay but &s;ome of tho&s;e great Men have al&s;o left many In&s;tructions concerning Religion, and Di&s;coveries of the divine Nature; as a &s;mall Acquaintance with <HI>Plato</HI> and &s;ome others will te&s;tify. Tho' <HI>Socrates</HI> wrote nothing him&s;elf (in which he re&s;embles the great In&s;tructor of Mankind) yet we have his Sentiments and his Manner of Life re|corded by tho&s;e who were familiar with him, and at the &s;ame time the fine&s;t Hands in the World. <HI>Epictetus</HI> wrote none neither, but we have that Lo&s;s &s;upplied by <HI>Simplicius</HI> and <HI>Arrian.</HI> Nor are the Poets to be overlook'd among tho&s;e ancient Wri|ters, Morality being their aim too in ano|ther Dre&s;s.

<P>AS to <HI>modern</HI> Authors, a Man is to make the be&s;t u&s;e of them he can, without di&s;|paraging or over-valuing them. All Searches are painful, and much rubbi&s;h mu&s;t be turn'd over before coming at the be&s;t Books, and before coming at what is <HI>excellent</HI> in &s;everal
<PB N="196" REF="207">
Books that are not de&s;picable.

<P>THERE is one Point in which a Reader has a con&s;iderable advantage of an Author; any Dullne&s;s he has is apparent, whereas the Reader's is be&s;t known to him|&s;elf, unle&s;s he &s;et up (again&s;t his Stars) as a Critick, and give his Opinion <HI>mal &agrave; propos.</HI> It may happen al&s;o, that what has been writ in good Humour, &s;hall be read in bad Hu|mour; which is another Di&s;advantage of an Author.

<P>CONSIDERING the great Va|riety of Humours, 'tis no wonder there is the &s;ame as to Books.

<P>THIS Reflection we have from an eminent Per&s;on, who knew the World very well; and it &s;hews how much we &s;tand in awe of the Opinion of Men. But whence comes it, that we are &s;o very much afraid of what others will &s;ay of us, even when we have a very mean Opinion of their Judgment? Words are but imaginary La&s;hes, and &s;till more when we do not hear them; never|thele&s;s &s;ome would chu&s;e to undergo the &s;e|vere&s;t Whipping, (if no body was to &s;ee it) rather than undergo the La&s;h of Cen&s;ure. And this dread of Cen&s;ure goes yet farther: we are afraid of what others will think of us, as well as of what they will &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215">
AND here 'tis all one, whether Decency has any real Foundation in Nature, or if it ari&s;es only from the Fancies of Men; &s;ince it is the Fear of Reproach that chiefly makes us avoid indecent Things, or what pa&s;&s;es for &s;uch in the Eye of the World: tho' it cannot be fairly deny'd that there is a <HI>real,</HI> as well as an <HI>imaginary</HI> Decency; as there is <HI>real,</HI> as well as <HI>imaginary</HI> Honour: and tho' the Reality of both is deny'd by a few Per&s;ons; 'tis a great que&s;tion if they are in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be granted that Decency, whe|ther imaginary or real, reaches no farther than the Out&s;ide and Circum&s;tances of an Action, without rendering it either <HI>morally</HI> good or bad, virtuous or vicious. <HI>Decent</HI> is one thing, and <HI>Lawful</HI> another. 'Tis unbecoming to eat alone, when a Man can have Company, tho' no body reckons it un|lawful: in &s;ome other Actions no Wit|ne&s;&s;es are to be admitted, for very good Rea|&s;ons. And the <HI>Cynicks</HI> who had all man|ner of <HI>Decorum</HI> in &s;uch contempt, only di&s;covered their own Pride, and Ignorance of Human Nature, the Dignity of which mu&s;t needs put our Actions under different Regulations from tho&s;e of inferiour Ani|mals.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="216">
IF any &s;hould ask, How we make out this Dignity of human Nature? it might be an&s;wer'd, that the Power which De|cency has in the World, is at lea&s;t a &s;trong Pre&s;umption of &s;ome Re&s;pect, ju&s;tly due to the Sentiments of our own Species; for we are not afraid of what Dogs and Hor&s;es will think of us. And we may judge of this Power of Decency by its being &s;uch a Re&s;traint upon Plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes in the mo&s;t Voluptuous.</P>
<P>DECENCY then owes its force to &s;ome tacit Con&s;ent, and Conviction of the Dig|nity of Mankind. What may be call'd <HI>real</HI> Decency, has its Foundation in the na|tural Congruity of Things; and what may be call'd <HI>imaginary,</HI> depends only upon Cu&s;tom. If any has a mind to call it <HI>cu&s;to|mary</HI> Decency, as being a &s;ofter Term, I &s;hall ea&s;ily go into it.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to be this la&s;t &s;ort of Decency, which the Duke <HI>de Rochefoucault</HI> calls <HI>the lea&s;t of all Laws</HI>; by which Term he would &s;eem to have an eye to the great Ob|ligations of Religion and Humanity, the Laws of the Land being tolerably well <HI>ob|&s;erv'd</HI> for fear of temporal Puni&s;hment. And &s;ome Things belonging to Religion are pretty well ob&s;erv'd too, either to com|pound the Matter with our Con&s;ciences,
<PB N="208" REF="217">
or to get the Name of religious Per&s;ons, or at lea&s;t to be call'd Ob&s;ervers of good Or|der.</P>
<P>THERE is even &s;ome Rea&s;on for ob|&s;erving cu&s;tomary Decency, or the Modes of the World, in things that are harmle&s;s, of inferiour Cla&s;&s;es; becau&s;e an Affectation of Singularity mu&s;t be Pride or Folly, or both. If a Man, for in&s;tance, living in a Country where they wear Hats, &s;hould wear a Turbant, how impertinent would this be? In things that are not unlawful, nor too inconvenient, a Compliance ought to be given, both on our Neighbours ac|count and our own. Why &s;hould we of|fend others, or expo&s;e our&s;elves to laughter for nothing at all? Indeed if the thing re|quired by this Decency appears unlawful, (about which a Man's own Con&s;cience mu&s;t be &s;atisfied) he is to &s;tand as firm as he can: and if the thing is too inconvenient (which mu&s;t be determin'd by his Prudence) a Compliance in this ca&s;e would be want of Sen&s;e, as in the former it would be want of Religion. Altho' a Man is to wear a Hat, he is not obliged to have a new one every Week; nor to put Lace about it, un|le&s;s &s;uch Hats were as much the Fa&s;hion as once were Shoulder-knots. But as &s;ome things are evidently fanta&s;tical as well as &s;uperfluous, it would &s;eem Deference e|nough to Cu&s;tom to comply with it, only
<PB N="209" REF="218">
in things of the latter &s;ort; and a good Mixture of Folly will be found even in the&s;e. There is no help, one mu&s;t be a little fooli&s;h, in a fooli&s;h World.</P>
<P>IT were much ea&s;ier to lay down general Rules, than to point out all the Exceptions and Limitations that are to be made upon them. <HI>The World abounds in good Maxims, but the Difficulty lies in the Application.</HI> We &s;ee imaginary Decency often interferes both with Religion and Prudence, and often gets the better of both: but the greate&s;t wonder is, that even Plea&s;ure &s;ometimes &s;ubmits to it.</P>
<P>THE Matter &s;eems plainly to &s;tand thus: we are at more pains to plea&s;e the World, than either to plea&s;e our &s;elves or the AL|MIGHTY. The Foundation of all which is the vain Fear of getting a mean Character among the few Per&s;ons that know us, or among tho&s;e that chance to hear of us.</P>
<P>'TIS true, there is a De&s;ire of Prai&s;e, as well as an Aver&s;ion to Reproach; but &s;ince they both produce the &s;ame good Be|haviour, and may proceed from the &s;ame Vanity, 'tis a matter indifferent which of them be con&s;idered as the Foundation of De|cency, <HI>that great Di&s;turber of Quiet and Plea&s;ure:</HI> as in another view it may be
<PB N="210" REF="219">
called the great Security of our mo&s;t va|luable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>CIVILITY and Politene&s;s are compre|hended in this Notion of Decency we have been talking of, which is but a &s;ort of Tenderne&s;s for our own Character: But there may be a Civility really proceeding from a Fear of making others unea&s;y, which may be call'd a Branch of Humanity, and is capable of continual Advances in true Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>SOME Hints given by <HI>Cicero,</HI> who had the Practice of Decency much at heart, may be of good u&s;e to fix &s;ome Notion of the thing it&s;elf. Speaking of the Diffe|rence between the Words <HI>Oportet</HI> and <HI>De|cet,</HI> he &s;ays to this purpo&s;e:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><HI>Oportere enim perfectionem declarat Officii quo &amp; &s;emper utendum e&s;t, &amp; omnibus. Decere, qua&s;i aptum e&s;&s;e con&s;enta|neumque tempori &amp; per&s;onae: quod cum in factis &s;aepi&s;&s;ime, tum in dictis valet, in vultu denique &amp; ge&s;tu, &amp; ince&s;&s;u, con+traque autem dedecere.</HI> <BIBL>De Oratore.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"To be nece&s;&s;ary, is under&s;tood of the indi&s;pu|table part of a Duty, or the Perfection of it, which is to be ob&s;erv'd to all Men without di&s;tinction: and thus we &s;ay <HI>it mu&s;t.</HI> To be decent, or when we only &s;ay, <HI>'Tis fit,</HI> or <HI>proper,</HI> implies no more than the Sutablene&s;s of the thing to the Time or the Per&s;on; which, tho' it is to be under&s;tood mo&s;t frequently of Actions, is to be under&s;tood al&s;o of Words, and
<PB N="211" REF="220">

<P>THIS great Man always di&s;tingui&s;hes carefully between things of a perpetual Ob|ligation, and &s;uch as only depend upon Times, Places, and Characters; and he is &s;o willing there &s;hould be nothing wrong even in the &s;malle&s;t matters, that he has not forgot to mention the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Gait.</HI></P>
<P>HE had but little occa&s;ion to &s;ay any thing about Dre&s;s, and &s;ome other Points of Decency that perplex the World now, &s;uch things being at that time under more &s;tated Regulations.</P>
<P>IT would appear &s;ometimes as if the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves had not look'd on De|cency as a thing altogether unworthy of their Care; for St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>hone&s;t things in the &s;ight of Men.</HI> 'Tis true, the two Words which are tran&s;lated into <HI>ho|ne&s;t</HI> and <HI>decent,</HI> and by &s;ome Per&s;ons ri|dicul'd, are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly by that A|po&s;tle; but they would &s;eem in &s;ome places to denote &s;omewhat of a lower Order than the Duties of Religion and Morality. Per|haps they may be con&s;idered as being op|po&s;ite to <HI>&s;hameful,</HI> when it does not imply <HI>moral Turpitude,</HI> but only &s;ome Improprie|ty &s;hocking to the Eye; as when he &s;ays
<PB N="212" REF="221">
<HI>it is a &s;hame for a Man to have long Hair,</HI> and that <HI>Nature even teaches the &s;ame.</HI> No doubt this In&s;tance has appear'd &s;tronger at that time than it does now: but we need ob&s;erve no more about it, than that there are &s;ome natural Congruities and In|congruities, neither to be call'd Virtues nor Vices, which Per&s;ons of good Ta&s;te mu&s;t be more &s;en&s;ible of than others; and 'tis generally reckon'd, the Ancients had a bet|ter Ta&s;te than the Moderns.</P>
<P>INDEED any body that knows the World but very little, will &s;ee how ma|ny Difficulties mu&s;t ari&s;e from the fan|ta&s;tical Cu&s;toms of Men, and their cla&s;hing Opinions concerning Decency, now that Plainne&s;s and Simplicity of Manners are bani&s;hed the World. Some new thing happens every day, or almo&s;t every hour, to put one's Di&s;cretion to the trial; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to have Rules for every thing laid down to our &s;elves beforehand. We find <HI>Cicero,</HI> for in&s;tance, advi&s;ing to treat People according to their Ranks and Offices, which is certainly a good Rule in the ge|neral. But how are we to treat tho&s;e Per&s;ons who&s;e Rank is not fix'd, nor their Office known? If their Fortunes are made, that is, if they have got &s;ome Money (the quantity of which is not fix'd neither) it is not u&s;ual to enquire any farther, but to treat them according to the Value they put
<PB N="213" REF="222">
upon them&s;elves; and we find they make their way into the greate&s;t <HI>A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> of what kind &s;oever. But as this Indulgence may be a good expedient to make &s;uch Per|&s;ons ea&s;y, it mu&s;t naturally make others unea&s;y at the &s;ame time, who look upon the ill-plac'd Re&s;pect as if it were &s;o much robbed from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>FOR as Decency re&s;pects not only a Man's own Character, but the Character of tho&s;e he mu&s;t hold Commerce with in the World; the difficulty of ob&s;erving it with reference to others, is often greater than with reference to one's &s;elf alone. For tho' the World will meddle to judge of a Man's fulfilling his Character purely as to what he owes him&s;elf and his Station, yet in dealing with others, he mu&s;t both &s;atisfy tho&s;e that are not concern'd and tho&s;e that are; the la&s;t of whom will be &s;o much harder to plea&s;e, that they are Par|ties as well as Judges.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, there are &s;o many little things to be ob&s;erved under the Notion of De|cency, that, as matters now &s;tand, it is be|come a very trouble&s;ome Affair. In the In&s;tance of per&s;onal Re&s;pect, there &s;eems to be a Contradiction between the Rules given by <HI>Cicero</HI> and St. <HI>James,</HI> which might be &s;uch a &s;trait upon Chri&s;tians, as to make them free them&s;elves from very much
<PB N="214" REF="223">
of the Burthen. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jam.</HI> ii. 1.</NOTE>The Apo&s;tle forbids the Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons in very plain Words, and gives a very plain Example of unju&s;t Preference and Partiality. 'Tis true, the na|tural Tendency of this would not be to overturn all Civility, it would rather make it more equal and exten&s;ive: For another Apo&s;tle bids us <HI>honour all Men</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 17.</NOTE>. But the Face of Chri&s;tianity is &s;o much alter'd &s;ince tho&s;e times, that in &s;everal Things relating to Politene&s;s and cu&s;tomary De|cency, I'm afraid we mu&s;t follow <HI>Cicero</HI> ra|ther than the Apo&s;tles; &s;ince it would be an ill-&s;uted thing, and contrary to true De|cency, to join the Forms of primitive Chri|&s;tianity with the Spirit that now prevails, which may be call'd a modern Heatheni&s;m. I &s;hall leave this Point without any further Explication.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that occurr'd concern|ing Decency, was the Power it has in the Actions of Men, without regard to its Foundation in nature: but it &s;eems there is a real Congruity in things, altogether in|dependent on Fancy or on Cu&s;tom; and the Violation of this Congruity, or Order of Nature, is in &s;ome Ca&s;es not only <HI>in|decent,</HI> but <HI>abominable.</HI> If any body &s;hould ask a proof of this A&s;&s;ertion, I know not how it could be prov'd by any thing clearer than it&s;elf. An Appeal may be made to
<PB N="215" REF="224">
any Man in his Sen&s;es, whether he is not per&s;uaded there is <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> in ge|neral? If any &s;hould deny &s;uch a Di&s;tinc|tion, he would cea&s;e to be a Member of Human Society; and all Corre&s;pondence mu&s;t be given up with him: as if one &s;hould deny there is any difference between Light and Darkne&s;s, or bid us prove that we &s;ee and hear, we mu&s;t take leave and part. Even tho&s;e who would pull up the Fence of worldly Decency, would introduce very wretched doings: but they will make very few Pro&s;elytes, while the De&s;ire of <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> is &s;o rooted in the Heart of Man.</P>
<P>MOST People are not only convinced of the Di&s;tinction of Right and Wrong in things of highe&s;t con&s;equence, but they allow it to take place even in Trifles. There are certain Demon&s;trations of Civi|lity, which are more or le&s;s &s;hocking to the Eye: but as &s;uch things are properly the Dancing-Ma&s;ter's care, &s;o an Error as to them is not to be called Incivility, but Aukwardne&s;s. An hone&s;t Farmer may be a very civil Per&s;on, tho' he knows not how to make a Leg: and his clowni&s;h Behavi|our is even more agreeable than finical Airs and Speeches.</P>
<P>SUCH things are indeed but arbitrary &s;igns of Civility, and purely depending upon Cu&s;tom; tho' &s;till there is a better and a
<PB N="216" REF="225">
wor&s;e manner of performing them. And it were &s;trange if the Mind of a rational Creature, made for Truth and Benevolence, were not &s;hock'd with things of an im|moral kind, as well as the Eye is unea&s;y to &s;ee &s;uch frivolous Incongruities.</P>
<P>THE very word <HI>Bien&s;eance</HI> &s;uppo&s;es there is a natural Fitne&s;s or Agreement, or &s;omething that every body under&s;tands by the words <HI>proper, becoming, fit, &s;eemly,</HI> and twenty more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; which may have taken their Ri&s;e from &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Ideas, as that of People's Clothes <HI>&s;itting well</HI> or hanging well about them; the Taylor being here the great Law-giver. And hence Decent Pride has come to be a current Expre&s;&s;ion, for 'tis certain that one Per&s;on's Pride has a more becoming air than another's.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay that all this proceeds purely from Cu&s;tom and Education, is to begin at the wrong end: for the&s;e are founded upon Decency, and not Decency upon them. Imaginary Decency will allow Cu&s;tom a large enough Province, but real Decency will allow it no Province at all. It &s;tands upon it's own Foundation. And when In&s;tances are brought from the mi|&s;erable Behaviour of the <HI>Hotentots,</HI> and &s;uch rude Tribes, to overthrow Decency in all its Acceptations; the Objection can
<PB N="217" REF="226">
have little weight again&s;t the general Sen&s;e of Mankind in all Ages. The&s;e poor People are certainly ill educated, and &s;o are many of the Polite World in a different re&s;pect. Education is commonly but a &s;ervile Imi|tation of others; the Rule that Parents pro|po&s;e in bringing up their Children, being to make them mere Apes, as they have no better &s;tandard of Life them&s;elves: and &s;o the World goes on. But the mi&s;take is in &s;uppo&s;ing that Education con&s;titutes the Beauty of Things, whereas it only helps us to &s;ee it; as a Mu&s;ick-Ma&s;ter may be &s;aid to help the Ear to perceive the Harmony, at the &s;ame time that he teaches the Hand to play. And here indeed we &s;ee the force of Cu&s;tom very remarkably: the external Practice is not only facilitated, but the in|ternal Reli&s;h is improved al&s;o. The fre|quent hearing good Mu&s;ick, and the &s;eeing good Painting, improves the Ta&s;te in both; and the contrary tends evidently to cor|rupt it.</P>
<P>NOR can this Influence of Cu&s;tom be denied in matters of Vertue, and even in Speculations. As &s;ome little things in Dre&s;s and outward Behaviour are call'd ei|ther <HI>Decent</HI> or <HI>Na&s;ty,</HI> ju&s;t as they happen to be fa&s;hionable or unfa&s;hionable; many Per&s;ons have hardly a better Rule either for their Opinions or their Practice. But as Philo&s;ophy cannot pretend to account for
<PB N="218" REF="227">
tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions; all the u&s;e that ought to be made of the Ob&s;ervation, is to guard again&s;t bad Examples, and to think as freely and deliberately as po&s;&s;ible. I have not de|&s;ign'd in any of the&s;e little By-reflections concerning the Dignity of Man, and the Order of things, to carry the Notion of De|cency any higher than was given of it at fir&s;t; that is, only as it affects the Cir|cum&s;tances of our Actions, without mak|ing us innocent or guilty in the &s;ight of Heaven. 'Tis very true, that every thing that's &s;inful is indecent, the le&s;&s;er being comprehended in the greater, but every thing that's indecent is not &s;inful; and many things which the World would reckon indecent, are far from being &s;o in reality. But the Vexation that ari&s;es upon Cen&s;ure, or the Fear of incurring it, works &s;o &s;trongly upon that Fund of Shame within Mankind, that they hardly do or omit any thing without putting the Que&s;tion (as it were) to them&s;elves, <HI>What will be &s;aid of it?</HI> And it is well that this re&s;traint is in the World.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed a <HI>true</HI> Shame, as well as a <HI>fal&s;e:</HI> or rather, it takes its Denomi|nation from the things we are a&s;ham'd of. If they are contrary to real Decency, the Shame is ju&s;t; either when we feel it or fear it: if they are only contrary to Fan|ta&s;tical Decency, the Shame is fooli&s;h. But
<PB N="219" REF="228">
the Confu&s;ion and Dejection of Mind may be the &s;ame, as People are &s;ometimes really frighted at a Shadow. The <HI>mauvai&s;e Honte</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> often means Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is much owing to the Complexion; the Blood being more ea&s;ily put in agi|tation in &s;ome Per&s;ons than others; and the Appearance it makes in the Counte|nance is far from being unbecoming in the <HI>Sex</HI> and in young Men.</P>
<P>THAT the Pa&s;&s;ion of Shame is pecu|liar to Mankind, is generally agreed on; as al&s;o that it is often the Re&s;ult of Pride, another Quality peculiar to our Species. Fear and Fiercene&s;s belong to other Ani|mals, but they are hardly touch'd with Shame, or capable of reflecting on the Con|&s;equences of their Actions: all their Mo|tions are &s;udden, and they go directly to their Aim. If in their Anger they &s;eem to deliberate before they attack, it mu&s;t be from &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of getting the wor&s;t: but in following their Appetites they have neither Reflection nor Remor&s;e. In which re&s;pect Mankind, are not &s;o happy, who have their Plea&s;ure to gratify, and their Character to &s;upport at the &s;ame time; and when the one or the other mu&s;t give way, Decency pleads for the Cha|racter, and is &s;ometimes hearkened to, and &s;ometimes not.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229">
THE greater the Pride is, this Decency has the greater Dominion. We find every body complaining of the Tyranny of Cu&s;|tom, which is, in other words, the Ty|ranny of Decency. But it gets a new Dominion from the Elevation of Per&s;ons, or their Rank in the World: for tho' the meane&s;t Per&s;on has his Pride and his De|cencies to ob&s;erve, yet they are far more numerous and trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e in higher Stations, who, having for the mo&s;t part little el&s;e to do, contrive many fanci|ful things, and &s;ubject them&s;elves and others to the Ob&s;ervance of them. And as the World is the School where the&s;e painful Rules are learned, the thing chiefly recommended is the Acquaintance of People of Fa&s;hion; and the Advice is by no means to be de&s;pi&s;ed: but it &s;hould be remembred, that the World is al&s;o the School of Vani|ty, wherein Self-Love is more nouri&s;hed than either Virtue or true Decency, which may be call'd its Offspring; &s;o that we &s;hould look out for Per&s;ons of Virtue and good Ta&s;te, in order to form our Manners, as well as to make our few Days pa&s;s with the le&s;s Chagrin.</P>
<P>OUR Quiet mu&s;t certainly have &s;ome other Foundation than the Decency of the World, or we &s;hall have no true Quiet at all. We may well hug our &s;elves
<PB N="221" REF="230">
a little in the Concealment of our Actions and Motives, and reckon it <HI>clear Gain</HI> what is thus hid from the Eyes of Men; but &s;till many Di&s;coveries will be made again&s;t us, notwith&s;tanding our &s;lavi&s;h Hypocri&s;y, &s;o long as we have no better Principle than the De&s;ire of Men's E&s;teem, or the Fear of their Reproach. Any body may con&s;ider how poor a thing a Life mu&s;t be that's &s;pent in Grimaces and Airs, tho' Re|ligion were out of the que&s;tion. Even our Ob&s;ervance of Punctilio's ought to be from the Heart, that is, from an hone&s;t Inten|tion not to &s;hock our Friends and Acquain|tance. And upon that account chiefly the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t Decency of all kinds are to be avoided: Singularity is very offen|&s;ive, as being a tacit Reprimand of the Be|haviour of others; who fail not in their turn to call tho&s;e Singularities <HI>ridiculous,</HI> and they may really appear &s;o thro' their Unu&s;ualne&s;s.</P>
<P>'TIS always to be remembred, that we are to con&s;ult the World no farther than as to our outward Behaviour: nor does it pretend to teach us the Rules of Virtue, but only how to &s;hun Ridicule, a thing on the other hand we ought not to be too much afraid of, le&s;t we make a Sacrifice of our Virtue, our Convenience and all. There is the more rea&s;on for this Caution that the World is made up of &s;o many
<PB N="222" REF="231">
different Ta&s;tes, that 'tis &s;imply impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e all: This Man &s;hall complain, that you u&s;e too much Ceremony with him; if you u&s;e le&s;s of it with another, he &s;hall think you <HI>brutal</HI>; and perhaps the former Complainer would not have been &s;o ea&s;y, if any part of it had been omitted. This is but one In&s;tance: it is impo&s;&s;ible to mention all the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Regulations in the Affair of Decency, and the Mi&s;takes People fall into by their injudicious En|deavours to <HI>plea&s;e</HI>; very often mi&s;taking the Objects of their Civility and Complai|&s;ance, as well as the right Proportion of the thing. If a Man &s;hould be &s;urly to his own Family, and his neare&s;t Friends, and obliging and frank with tho&s;e he only makes an Afternoon's Vi&s;it to; this were no Argument either of his good Sen&s;e or his good Humour, but would look like a vain De&s;ire of Applau&s;e from tho&s;e he has little to do with: and if a Woman &s;hould fall into the &s;ame Affectation, it would be nothing to her prai&s;e. Husbands and Wives have certainly a Title to good Looks and good Words, as well as Stran|gers.</P>

into formal Ceremony, or too &s;oft Com|plai&s;ance: all which mu&s;t bring Ridicule upon us, and 'tis the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of this School-Mi&s;tre&s;s (for &s;o the World may be likewi&s;e call'd) to prevent that Morti|fication.</P>
<P>THE Severity of the School-Mi&s;tre&s;s will hardly be complain'd of, when we con&s;ider the Allowances that are given to gratify the &s;tronge&s;t Inclinations of the Heart. A Man is not found fault with for &s;triving to get as much Money as he can, or a&s;piring after the highe&s;t Employments and Honours in the Commonwealth; he is rather blam'd if he omits any Opportunity of rai&s;ing him|&s;elf, or neglects any Plea&s;ure. All the In|&s;truction the World gives, is to keep free of certain Blunders in our Conduct, and weak Appearances, which affect the outward Cha|racter, without any regard to Vice or Vir|tue. The neglect of that In&s;truction does expo&s;e us to the Severity of the World, which in different re&s;pects may be call'd tyrannical and gentle; and the highe&s;t Prudence is to know when to make it our Guide, and when to de&s;pi&s;e its Maxims.</P>

<P>AS Creatures of the &s;ame Species have commonly a Plea&s;ure in herding and flocking together; the like Plea&s;ure is found among Mankind, with the De&s;ire of mutual Ap|probation added to it. Solitude and Self|approbation will not always &s;upport us, nor will Company and our own Appro|bation do it &s;eparately; we mu&s;t often have the Approbation of others, in order to re|concile us to our&s;elves. 'Tis true, there is one &s;ort of Pride, which will very much le&s;&s;en the De&s;ire of Approbation; that is, when a Per&s;on is throughly po&s;&s;e&s;t with an Opinion of his own Excellency. But this Pitch of Extravagance is very rare: in|feriour Degrees of it will be enough to &s;lacken the toil&s;ome Pur&s;uit of Applau&s;e, nay, if one is hot in the pur&s;uit of any other thing, he will mind the Judgment of the Publick &s;o much the le&s;s, and <HI>ap|plaud</HI> him&s;elf, as the Mi&s;er does when the People <HI>hi&s;s him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="234">
BUT as any Inclination is &s;eldom &s;o &s;trong as to make one renounce all views of popular Applau&s;e, &s;o the too eager Pur|&s;uit of that Uncertainty, is called Vanity rather than Pride: Vanity denoting the emptine&s;s of the Thing, as well as the fri|volous Temper of the Per&s;on. And thus &s;ome have made a Di&s;tinction between Pride and Vanity, giving us an Idea of two different &s;orts of Men, tho&s;e who content them&s;elves with their own Approbation, and tho&s;e who are unea&s;y without the Ap|probation of others. But perhaps the fir&s;t Temper is not only very rare, but impo&s;|&s;ible in nature, and &s;o the Difference is only in the greater and le&s;&s;er Degrees of Self|&s;ufficiency, or in the way that Pride di&s;|covers it&s;elf in different Per&s;ons. Tho&s;e that are fond of outward &s;how, or of mak|ing an appearance, are called <HI>Vain</HI>; tho&s;e that value them&s;elves upon their inward Endowments, <HI>Proud:</HI> but both Parties value them&s;elves, and both Parties may be called <HI>Vain,</HI> as both are really <HI>Proud</HI>; &s;ome proud of their native Ornaments, others of borrowed ones: and the very proude&s;t can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed free from the De&s;ire of E&s;teem from others. They are indeed freer from O&s;tentation, and their De&s;ire of E&s;teem is more conceal'd; but pure independent Self|&s;ufficiency is not a natural &s;tate of Mind; and if the Notion &s;hould enter the Thoughts
<PB N="226" REF="235">
of any created Being, it mu&s;t argue the greate&s;t Di&s;order of the Under&s;tanding that's conceivable.</P>
<P>BY Self-conceit is meant a much infe|rior Di&s;order, implying only an Opinion of one's own merit not well enough found|ed; and this &s;tate of Mind is only charge|able with more or le&s;s Folly. But the &s;imple De&s;ire of Approbation is neither chargeable with Folly nor Vice: for 'tis as natural to de&s;ire the Approbation of others as their Friend&s;hip, tho' Friend&s;hip is the mo&s;t delightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and commonly draws the other after it: we always e&s;teem tho&s;e we love, tho' we don't always love tho&s;e we e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THERE are other kinds of Pride which belong not &s;o naturally to the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, &s;uch as the De&s;ire of Power or De|minion over the Per&s;ons of others, and the De&s;ire of &s;ubduing their Judgment. The latter of the&s;e is mo&s;t found in &s;piritual Matters, tho' a de&s;ire of temporal Power may &s;ometimes be at the bottom. The De&s;ire of a little Triumph in Conver&s;ation is le&s;s extravagant, but more common, and ari&s;es almo&s;t upon every Subject whether grave or frivolous. But this Ob&s;ervation may be made, that according to the &s;everal kinds of Pride in Man, in conjunction with their &s;everal Tempers and Humours,
<PB N="227" REF="236">
&s;ome are more inclined to Company, others to Solitude. The Pur&s;uers of Fame mu&s;t expo&s;e them&s;elves to publick view, co&s;t what it will; the le&s;s O&s;tentive are more di&s;pos'd to Solitude. Tho&s;e again who are remar|kably afraid of Contempt, will for that very rea&s;on prefer Solitude, thinking they make a good bargain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rochefoucault.</NOTE><HI>to renounce all the Good that others might &s;ay of them, upon condition they would &s;ay no Ill.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Maxim (by the way) might infer &s;ome middle &s;tate between Approbation and Reproach, which is not &s;o conceivable; unle&s;s the <HI>&s;aying nothing</HI> &s;hould proceed from an ab&s;olute &s;u&s;pen&s;e of the Mind: but this is not u&s;ual, mo&s;t Minds being forward enough to pronounce Sentence one way or other, and mo&s;t Actions and Mo|tives being pretty evidently either worthy of Prai&s;e or Blame.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e a certain Di&s;tinc|tion betwixt Approbation and Applau&s;e, the former being under&s;tood to be given by good Judges, and the latter by the Mul|titude. Applau&s;e will never be de&s;ired where there is Wi&s;dom, and the De&s;ire of Approbation is only Pride when it is courted for it&s;elf, without de&s;iring a virtuous Di&s;|po&s;ition. And again, tho' the Fondne&s;s for Reputation may be an Argument of Pride,
<PB N="228" REF="237">
the Neglect of it will be no Argument of Humility, but of an abandon'd Character, or being without &s;hame. But Man is not only under different Directions or Impul&s;es from his Pride, but al&s;o from his oppo&s;its Inclinations; the&s;e al&s;o varying according to different Circum&s;tances of Age or For|tune: &s;o that our Motions mu&s;t be very uncertain and irregular, and &s;ometimes our Opinions are excited by our Inclinations, and &s;ometimes our Inclinations by our Opinions.</P>
<P>THESE Reflections, and many more that will ea&s;ily occur, may be of &s;ome u&s;e to di&s;cover the Foundation of Decency, as well as to &s;hew wherein it con&s;i&s;ts. If &s;ome things are naturally <HI>becoming,</HI> Men mu&s;t be plea&s;ed to &s;ee them ob&s;erved; and the Doer is plea&s;ed doubly, by his adhering to Nature, and his plea&s;ing others. There is Good-Humour and Complai&s;ance, as well as Vanity, in Mankind. But this very Com|plai&s;ance had need of Regulations, that it go not to an Exce&s;s; and, as things now &s;tand, a little Pride mu&s;t often come to the &s;upport of weak Virtue. If it &s;hall be cal|led only the &s;upport of a Character, it may be granted that the Aim often goes no farther: but then the Character may be reckoned at lea&s;t among the Out-works for the Defence of Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="238">
RELIGION and Good Manners &s;eem to expre&s;s all the Obligations Men are under. Natural Affection and Humanity, no doubt, are Obligations too; but they are included in Religion, as all the Duties are that con|cern our Neighbour. But by Good Man|ners People generally under&s;tand Morality, or Moral Virtue, which is reckon'd inferior to Religion, and yet is a higher thing than what is call'd Good Breeding or Decency; <Q REND="inline">"which, tho' the lea&s;t of all Laws, is more ob&s;erved than any."</Q></P>
<P>OUR Obligations &s;tanding in this Order, it may be thought &s;trange that the lowe&s;t &s;hould be &s;o much minded, and the highe&s;t &s;o little! All other Laws have a Sanction to enforce their Ob&s;ervance, Decency has not &s;o much as the Name of a Law, and the Sanction of it is only Cen&s;ure; and yet the Fear of incurring this imaginary Pain is &s;ometimes greater than the Fear of Hell. Many Per&s;ons, I know, would take it very ill to have their Belief of a future State cal|led in que&s;tion; but let them examine them|&s;elves, and &s;ee how far their Belief affects their Conduct, and whether their Fears are not more awakened as to the temporal Confu&s;ion than the eternal, and all the ex|qui&s;ite Torments they believe are join'd with it.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239">
THIS Fear of Shame and Di&s;grace con|tributes not a little even to the Ob&s;ervance of temporal Laws: it &s;ometimes goes farther than the Fear of Death. And where the Opi|nion of the World makes a crime extraordi|narily di&s;graceful, it is very rarely commit|ted; as Theft among Men of Fa&s;hion. If the Opinion of the World &s;hould happen to change, the taking a Bribe would be as little hear of among &s;ome Ranks, as the picking a Pocket.</P>
<P>BUT as neither Opinion nor Cu&s;tom can alter the Nature of Things, there will &s;till be a Party (however &s;mall) that will ap|prove and blame according to Rea&s;on; and &s;o Decency will be allowed all the Privileges it can ju&s;tly pretend to, and no more.</P>
<P>COU'D a Man be contented with the Approbation of this &s;mall Party, he would find him&s;elf con&s;iderably at ea&s;e: good Judges are not only ju&s;t, but mild, &s;o far as the thing will bear, and are not &s;evere upon every little Tre&s;pa&s;s or Punctilio. The Multitude indeed (by whom are meant the cager Followers of Cu&s;tom) are very indulgent in &s;ome matters of Con&s;equence, but &s;ometimes they cannot forgive the lea&s;t Trifle. Again, the great Body of the People, as they are almo&s;t without the Sphere of Decency e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom,
<PB N="231" REF="240">
which does not dazle them; &s;o they &s;ee better in Matters of real Decency, and abhor tho&s;e Crimes which the higher Ranks overlook.</P>
<P>IF this Di&s;tinction &s;hould be quarrel'd, as if it were making two different Multi|tudes, or two Cla&s;&s;es of the Mob; it may be an&s;wer'd, the Di&s;tinction is not new, and only &s;hews that the Difference between <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seneca.</NOTE><HI>fine</HI> Clothes and <HI>coar&s;e</HI> can add no weight to the Judgment of the Wearers. And certainly 'tis a great Point gain'd towards a Man's Quiet, when he knows who are his proper Judges, and is indifferent about the Opinion of others. This (if one could get at it) is not going too far in <HI>Stoi|ci&s;m.</HI> Nobody would chu&s;e to be on the Rack to their Lives end; and a Creature that pretends to Rea&s;on, had need al&s;o to con&s;ider what Life is de&s;ign'd for, as well as what the be&s;t means are to make it ea&s;y.</P>
<P>NOW upon a very little Reflection a Man will find, that he has not been made to be a <HI>Mountebank,</HI> but to act a more &s;olid part; to do what Good he can, and to endeavour <HI>heartily</HI> to acquire a Delight in all Virtues, in proportion to their value. And Delight, every body knows, makes a Facility in Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="241">
BUT this is &s;till to be remembred, that tho' the Delight in Virtue is &s;aid to be ac|quirable; yet the Sen&s;e of it, or the Faculty of reli&s;hing it, is brought with us into the World; as we bring the Faculty of Rea&s;on it&s;elf, which ripens by degrees, and all our Powers are improved or weaken'd by good or bad Management, to &s;ay nothing of the Foundation that's laid in this &s;tate of trial for our future Happine&s;s or Unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P>'TIS true, Decency and Virtue have different Provinces; and the former may be &s;aid to lie only within the Verge of this Dream of Life, wherein our Fellow-Pa&s;|&s;engers may indeed &s;et up Tribunals to judge of our Behaviour, but we know all the harm the&s;e Judges can do us.</P>
<P>As we di&s;cover our Pride therefore by affecting an univer&s;al E&s;teem, and our Cow|ardice by the Subjection we put our&s;elves under; &s;o in both In&s;tances we di&s;cover our Folly, the thing in the world we wou'd wi&s;h to di&s;cover lea&s;t. We can put a plau|&s;ible Face on &s;ome of our Weakne&s;&s;es, and imagine other People will &s;hew the like Favour; our Fear we can term <HI>Prudence,</HI> our Covetou&s;ne&s;s <HI>good Management,</HI> and &s;o of other Failings: but Folly is laugh'd at and hi&s;&s;ed by every body; and when our own good Opinion for&s;akes us, 'tis natural to
<PB N="233" REF="242">
conclude, that we are ridiculed by others: nay, &s;ometimes thro' the Di&s;order of our Judgment we think we are more ridicul'd than we are, or that certain Practices and Omi&s;&s;ions will draw more contempt upon us than po&s;&s;ibly they can; and &s;o we fall into the very thing we wou'd avoid, by our Apprehen&s;ion of falling into it.</P>
<P>THUS Mankind, by mi&s;taking their Judges and their Duties, are &s;till upon the Rack and in con&s;tant Slavery; unle&s;s we &s;hould except a very few Emperors; to whom no Rules are pre&s;cribed but their own Will. But tho' we do not know all that pa&s;&s;es in their Brea&s;ts, we may pre|&s;ume they have &s;ome Fear of Cen&s;ure like other Mortals. Nor, if we turn our Eyes to the oppo&s;ite and lowe&s;t Rank, can we affirm that they have got over all <HI>human Regards:</HI> 'tis probable that even <HI>&s;turdy Beggars</HI> are afraid of &s;ome Reproach among their own Gang.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be of that, we are pretty &s;ure the greate&s;t Rakes among Gentlemen have &s;ome Qualms about their Reputation; and tho' they talk and write again&s;t De|cency, as if they wi&s;hed it were out of the World, and probably they do bear it a Grudge, yet they cannot &s;hake off its Yoke, and are as much Hypocrites (in another way) as tho&s;e who pretend to have a va|lue
<PB N="234" REF="243">
for it; both Parties paying it a &s;ort of Homage, whether they will or not.</P>
<P>DECENCY, it &s;eems, will triumph over all Ranks and Characters, and will be a con&s;tant Di&s;cipline to Mankind. But our Pride and Ignorance make it a greater Di&s;|cipline than otherwi&s;e it would be. For if Virtue be agreeable to a Ta&s;te that is not wholly vitiated, Decency will be agree|able too: it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with Virtue, but rather is in&s;eparable from it, as the Shadow from the Body.</P>
<P>VIRTUOUS Per&s;ons therefore will ob|&s;erve Decency from the Principles of Vir|tue (the Love of Order, and true Civility) as the Vicious will ob&s;erve it from Self-In|tere&s;t: and &s;o it may be look'd upon as a great In&s;trument for pre&s;erving &s;ome Peace and good Order in the World; few Per&s;ons being &s;o thorowly virtuous as to need no re&s;traints, and few &s;o thorowly abandon'd as neither to be capable of Remor&s;e nor Shame.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it would be expected after the&s;e little Speculations concerning De|cency, that &s;ome In&s;tances &s;hould be given of the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t it. But as it would be but a di&s;agreeable Task, any Per&s;on of tolerable Sen&s;e will ea&s;ily know &s;uch Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es when he &s;ees them; and 'tis no ad|vantage to have the Head filled with un|lucky
<PB N="235" REF="244">
Images. All Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t Vir|tue, are certainly Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t De|cency, tho' the contrary Po&s;ition does not always hold: but &s;everal things that are only look'd on (by &s;ome) as Breaches of Decency, are really Breaches of Virtue and even of Religion. <HI>If any Man among you &s;eemeth to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this Man's Religion is vain</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>James.</HI></NOTE>. But not to make the World wor&s;e than it is, a great deal of the Humour of Detraction proceeds not &s;o much either from Pride, or Maligni|ty, as from a meer Habit of idle talking; till at la&s;t the Head becomes a Regi&s;ter of Tra&s;h and Scandal, and the Itch of Re|peating increa&s;es with the Itch of Hear|ing. If this Apology &s;hould not be kindly received, I &s;hould be content to know ano|ther Source of the Errors in Conver&s;ation than either Vanity or Ill-Humour, or down|right Folly; and there is &s;ometimes a Com|bination of all the three.</P>
<P>THE In&s;tances of Indecency in common Conver&s;ation (which would make a very large Book) are not the only Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. We tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t Decency in mo&s;t things we do for our plea&s;ure, and even for the &s;upport of our Character: Tho' in things of this latter Cla&s;s 'tis Cu&s;tom under the name of Decency that mi&s;leads us; for if we are but told, <HI>that &s;uch a thing is done</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="245">
<HI>or not done,</HI> we enquire no farther. But as we are not to torture our&s;elves with the Fear of being ill &s;poke of, we mu&s;t even &s;hun too great a Squeami&s;hne&s;s, or the Fear of doing ill. Where Religion and Virtue are &s;ilent, common Sen&s;e mu&s;t determine the be&s;t way it can.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sex</HI> have their particular Decencies, both natural and artificial, which they ob|&s;erve with great exactne&s;s. <HI>Decent Pride</HI> is appropriated to them: and tho' it is but a poetical Expre&s;&s;ion, both Sexes being un|der equal Obligations as to Virtue, and un|der equal Re&s;traints as to Vice, yet the Women have a right to value them&s;elves a little upon their native Charms and the outward Advantages of Fortune, that Men (who have more Ill-nature than they, and as much Vanity of another kind) may not look upon them as too ea&s;y a Conque&s;t. Good Sen&s;e and &s;ome Religion (to which Women are more inclinable than Men) will help to keep this Self-E&s;teem of theirs within due bounds, that they may not for|get their lovelie&s;t, and even brighte&s;t Cha|racter, Good-humour; nor appear without <HI>the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit.</HI> For it mu&s;t not be forgot, that there is a difference between <HI>decent Pride</HI> and <HI>De|cency</HI> it&s;elf, and it &s;eems to be this: De|cency is a certain Gracefulne&s;s in Actions; <HI>decent Pride</HI> is a Regard to Reputation, with
<PB N="237" REF="246">
&s;ome mixture of Self-E&s;teem not too ob|&s;ervable: and it were good upon &s;ome occa&s;ions that even Men had a little more of this Quality, till a better Principle takes place. If Self-Intere&s;t could be wholly &s;eparated from the regard to Reputation, it would immediately be of the number of the pure Virtues; and if a Man had any view of being u&s;eful to the World, the more Reputation he has, the more he is u&s;eful.</P>
<P>PRIDE would get very little footing in the mid&s;t of Applau&s;e and Approbation, if a Man knew him&s;elf well, and what he is in Soul and Body at his be&s;t. He would &s;oon acknowledge the Truth of that an|cient Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Pride was not made for Man.</HI> The &s;ame Knowledge would inform him, that Applau&s;e is a dangerous thing for a Mind &s;o ea&s;ily puffed up. And as the Knowledge of our&s;elves, and the Know|ledge of the World are &s;ub&s;ervient to each other, &s;o by this latter Knowledge we find out the Difficulty and the Emptine&s;s of that airy Conque&s;t; and by &s;eeing the Ridicule that others fall into, we are &s;omewhat on our guard to &s;hun it; the Fear of Shame being as natural to us, as the Fear of Pain: and Shame is truly a Pain of the Mind, as every one that has felt it will acknowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247">
THOSE who alledge that Shame is only artificially work'd up in human Nature, may as well alledge, that any other Sen&s;a|tion is &s;o work'd up: the Fear of it indeed may be artificially excited in us, as the Fear of &s;everal things may be excited the &s;ame way: We may be afraid <HI>where no Fear is,</HI> as well as a&s;hamed where no Shame is; and we may be in&s;en&s;ible both as to Fear and Shame, when we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to be &s;en&s;ible of both, as the old Comedian has told us.</P>
<P>ONE might ea&s;ily be led into a Di&s;&s;er|tation upon Shame (e&s;pecially from the words of the Text) de&s;igning only to make a few Reflections upon Decency; &s;uch a Connexion there is between the two; and the different &s;orts of Ridicule, or the Va|riety of ridiculous Characters are ready al|&s;o to come into the Mind: but as &s;uch Characters are without number, and are all Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t Decency, many of them are repre&s;ented every day in Books of Wit and Humour, and even in Books of Di|vinity; &s;o that the World may be well in|&s;tructed in the ways of &s;hunning Deri&s;ion. And indeed all the Authors have rea&s;on for touching upon that &s;tring, &s;ince the Fear of Shame is &s;o prevalent with Men: 'Tis a thing that &s;tirs very early, for even Nur&s;es endeavour to &s;hame their young ones into
<PB N="239" REF="248">
good Behaviour and Decency, before Rea|&s;on is awakened in them; and it often has a good Effect, beyond the Threats of whip|ping.</P>
<P>THIS Sen&s;e of Shame is often a promi|&s;ing Di&s;po&s;ition towards Virtue, and is a very agreeable Delicacy of Spirit. Impu|dence is Stupidity, 'tis the want of one kind of Sen&s;e, or of &s;omething implanted by the Author of Nature in rational Creatures. We &s;ee how carefully tho&s;e Decencies are ob&s;erved, that relate to the Body, as if there was a Re&s;pect due even to it, and Men were con&s;cious of &s;ome Advantage in their outward Form: No Nation goes upon all four. The Body is not only covered, but adorned. 'Tis true, this may infer a Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Defect, and &s;ome natural Di&s;|advantages, which mu&s;t be granted; but it is the part of Rea&s;on to &s;upply and rec|tify all Di&s;advantages, &s;o far as it can. We even ob&s;erve numberle&s;s Decencies natu|rally, without Art and In&s;truction, from a Sen&s;e of what is beautiful as well as of what is un&s;eemly. If we hear &s;ometimes of poor doings, and great Degeneracy in human Nature, it needs give no more &s;ur|prize than when we &s;ee a good Tree ill|train'd, or a piece of Ground over-run with Weeds. It happens on the other hand too often, that external Decencies are minded with an extraordinary Carefulne&s;s, when
<PB N="240" REF="249">
there are horrid Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es committed a|gain&s;t Virtue.</P>
<P>A few Hints or <HI>Items</HI> well remembred, will &s;ave a multitude of Illu&s;trations, that might be made upon this Subject of De|cency. What follows is not propo&s;ed to have the Authority of Maxims, but is of|fer'd only to the Con&s;ideration of &s;ome Per|&s;ons who have not much lei&s;ure to read large Treati&s;es; and upon a very little at|tention, a variety of Reflections will &s;pring in their own Minds in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be a Fund to work upon, in concurrence with good In&s;truction.</P>
<P>MAN naturally loves Virtue and De|cency: and when he is deceived, it is un|der an appearance of &s;omething that's good.</P>
<P>WE are often led by meer Imitation, and often ruined by it.</P>
<P>DECENT, with mo&s;t People, is but another word for <HI>Cu&s;tomary.</HI> Hence the interfering of Decency and Virtue.</P>
<P>DECENCY in Opinions is more pro|perly Truth: in Inclinations and Actions 'tis Virtue and Goodne&s;s. But the common Province of Decency goes no farther than

the Circum&s;tances of Actions, or the Man|ner of doing them.</P>

<P>THE Indecencies of Conver&s;ation ari&s;e from Vanity, Ill-humour, and a ba&s;tard kind of Good-humour. This fal&s;e Complai&s;ance appears much in the Cu&s;tom of Detraction: it goes on again&s;t the Ab&s;ent, becau&s;e 'tis &s;uppos'd to be agreeable to the Pre&s;ent, who become the Ab&s;ent the next moment, and &s;uffer in their turn.</P>
<P>PROFESS'D Indecency of any kind is In&s;olence. Vanity is commonly the fir&s;t Inducement to fooli&s;h talking. Thus &s;mutty Je&s;ts oftener &s;hew the O&s;tentation of Wit than the Inclination to Lewdne&s;s; and im|pious Expre&s;&s;ions are no &s;ure Argument of Unbelief.</P>
<P>AN Exce&s;s of talking of any kind is &s;el|dom free from the &s;ame Vanity.</P>
<P>MOROSENESS is the Effect of Pride, as if the Company was not worthy of our mixing with it. The Indecency lies in the &s;ullen Air.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="251">
INDECENCIES in Apparel are as much &s;hunn'd as any. Herein Cu&s;tom triumphs eminently: 'tis the chief Point of Unifor|mity among all Ranks and Parties.</P>
<P>IN all other Articles of Expence, that which is neare&s;t the middle mu&s;t be Decen|cy; the preci&s;e Point not being di&s;cover|able: the Extremes of <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low</HI> are either call'd Extravagant or Sordid.</P>

It lulls our Spirits a&s;leep, and by turns rou&s;es them. In &s;hort, Decency may be <HI>now</HI> reckon'd of &s;uch &s;ervice in the Commonwealth, that without it the Judicatures both in Church and State wou'd have much more to do than they have; to &s;ay nothing of the Tranquillity it helps to pre&s;erve in private Families.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;putes upon this Subject have been very much increas'd (as it &s;till happens) by the diffe|rent Acceptations of the Terms, which ought regularly to have been ad|ju&s;ted before entering upon the Merits or Demerits of the Thing. Some Men have exalted <HI>Self-Love</HI> &s;o high, as to make it the Source of the greate&s;t Duties, while others have look'd upon it as the Sink of all Wickedne&s;s! And &s;ometimes its greate&s;t Advocates, when they are pre&s;s'd with Dif|ficulties, declare plainly they meant no o|ther thing but Self-Pre&s;ervation; which, if duly regulated, no body can have a good Rea&s;on to condemn.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="254">
FROM this Ob&s;curity, and Contradiction, have ari&s;en new Di&s;putes concerning Hu|man Nature; &s;ome making very unfavou|rable Reports of it, and others affirming it to be without fault. The former Party a&s;&s;ert, <Q REND="inline">"That a Man is not capable of the lea&s;t Act of common Hone&s;ty, or com|mon Friend&s;hip, without a deliberate Pro|&s;pect of his own Intere&s;t as the prevailing Motive."</Q> And thus the &s;elfi&s;h Prin|ciple, which may be compared to <HI>the dead Fly in the Apothecary's Ointment,</HI> is &s;et up as the only Wi&s;dom or true Rule of all Actions and De&s;igns! This is al&s;o a fal&s;e Account of Religion, if we &s;uppo&s;e Man to have a higher End than him&s;elf, or con|&s;ider Religion as the Duty we owe another Being, and a Being of &s;uch Perfections as are only to be found in the Deity.</P>
<P>THE latter Party maintain the Principle of Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s &s;ufficiently: but as they deny the Infirmity and Corruption of hu|man Nature, their Doctrine labours under in&s;uperable Difficulties.</P>
<P>THESE two Partys are diametrically op|po&s;ite to each other in their Schemes and Opinions, agreeing only in their Aver&s;ion to reveal'd Religion, which indeed would be an u&s;ele&s;s Thing if either of the Schemes was true: a Creature &s;o highly exalted, and
<PB N="247" REF="255">
able to govern it&s;elf, needed no other A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; and a Creature &s;o very low, and de|prived of all Liberty, mu&s;t be incapable of any Degree of Virtue.</P>
<P>THERE is a third &s;ort of Men, who ad|mit the Difference between Right and Wrong, and &s;hew likewi&s;e a great Re&s;pect for the Chri&s;tian Religion; I ought to &s;ay farther, that I believe them to be &s;incere: but at the &s;ame time they are &s;o violent Advocates for <HI>Self-Love,</HI> or the intere&s;ted Principle, as to &s;peak of the <HI>pure di&s;inte|re&s;ted</HI> Love of God in very unbecoming Terms.</P>
<P>SINCE any Controver&s;y that may ari&s;e in this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> is chiefly with tho&s;e who own Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall &s;ay little in behalf ei|ther of its Proofs or its Doctrine, both which have &s;tood firm again&s;t the Attacks of more &s;ubtile Spirits than we have at pre|&s;ent; my principal De&s;ign being in a ra|tional way to &s;hew the be&s;t and the wor&s;t of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> and in what &s;en&s;e it is to be under&s;tood, before it can be &s;et up ei|ther as the Principle of Vice or Virtue.</P>

<P>CUSTOM, which determines the Sig|nification of Words, has generally put a bad meaning upon <HI>Self-Love</HI>; &s;o that a <HI>Self-Lover</HI> is reckoned the &s;ame with an intere&s;ted unju&s;t Per&s;on, who&s;e Intere&s;t or Plea&s;ure (in whatever Form it appears to him) will be his con&s;tant Aim, without any regard to the Rules of Equity.</P>

There <HI>Self-Love</HI> is put at the head of a great train of Vices, as if it was the Parent of them all: <HI>Lovers of their own &s;elves, Covetous</HI> (or Lovers of Money) <HI>Boa&s;ters, Proud,</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="249" REF="257">
others who he thinks are not &s;o privileged, and envying &s;uch as are. Hence the Idea of &s;piritual Pride.</P>
<P>CONFORMABLE to the&s;e Accepta|tions of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and other Nations generally under&s;tand by it Pride and all other ill Qualities of the Mind; but Pride mo&s;t frequently. <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> is every where a vile Character.</P>
<P>AMONG the ea&s;ie&s;t Acceptations of <HI>Self-Love</HI> is &s;uch a Self-Complacency or Self-conceit, as is repre&s;ented by the Fable of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> and which is only con&s;idered as a Folly.: But it is accompany'd for the mo&s;t part with Arrogance, and a De&s;ire of engro&s;&s;ing all things. And thus <HI>Self-Love</HI> has become a current Term for Pride, (as was &s;aid before) or another Word for cor|rupt Nature in all its Tendencies: at the &s;ame time 'tis a &s;ofter Word, and &s;o has been introduced by polite Per&s;ons, when they had not a mind to &s;hock delicate Ears.</P>
<P>THERE is a ma&s;terly De&s;cription of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> &s;uppos'd to be done by the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucault,</HI> as it now works in the Heart of Man: 'tis a &s;mall Book, and very much known. He begins thus, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Additions, No II.</NOTE>Self-Love <HI>is the Love of one's &s;elf, and of all things for the &s;ake of one's &s;elf.</HI> After which De|finition,
<PB N="250" REF="258">
he proceeds to mention the Effects. <HI>It makes Men Idolaters of them&s;elves, and would make them the Tyrants of others, if Fortune gave them an Opportunity.</HI> This &s;uppo&s;es the total Subver&s;ion of our Duty, both to God and Man: we not only act as if we were independent of the Almighty, but we &s;et up our&s;elves to be wor&s;hipped in his &s;tead; and are not only carele&s;s and un|mindful of our Neighbour's Intere&s;t, but make a Sacrifice of it, and him to our own. Such is the Mode&s;ty of Self-Love!</P>
<P>MEAN time, the fir&s;t part of the Defi|nition, <HI>Self-Love is the Love of one's Self,</HI> gives us but little Di&s;covery; and the &s;econd part of it is not quite &s;o proper: for <HI>the Love of Things for our own Sake,</HI> implies only a De&s;ire of them, as being &s;erviceable to us, the Love terminating upon our&s;elves. And thus &s;ome have blunder'd, who con|found Self-Love with the Love of Plea&s;ure, or any thing the Heart is &s;et upon. And &s;ometimes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Additions, No I.</NOTE>Plea&s;ure, and Intere&s;t, and Happine&s;s are all jumbled together, and made convertible Terms for <HI>Self-Love</HI>; which is a greater Confu&s;ion &s;till. But this Critici&s;m has nothing to do with the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s Account of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> who &s;eems only to have intended to give a Repre&s;entation of that Principle in its va|rious Shapes and bad Con&s;equences. Ac|cordingly,
<PB N="251" REF="259">
he next con&s;iders it in <HI>its Im|petuou&s;ne&s;s, its Subtilty, its Refinements</HI>; and adds, <HI>that it is often invi&s;ible to it &s;elf: that it hatches and nouri&s;hes an in|finite Number of Inclinations and Aver&s;ions, &s;ome of which are &s;o very mon&s;trous, that it cannot believe them to be its own Brood.</HI> He &s;ays, <HI>it is made up of Contradictions, and can act the mo&s;t contrary Parts; proud and fawning. It changes its Pur&s;uits of Glory, Riches and Plea&s;ure, according to our Complexion, and the Changes of our Age and our Condition: but it is equal to it, to have many Pur&s;uits, or but one; for it can divide it&s;elf into many, or contract it&s;elf into one, as it has a mind.</HI> He gives a View of its Incon&s;tancy, both as it pro|ceeds from <HI>the In&s;ufficiency of Things which plea&s;e us, and our own natural Changeable|ne&s;s.</HI> He &s;hews its extreme Po&s;itivene&s;s, <HI>which makes a Man do the mo&s;t fanta&s;tical Things, and even &s;uch as are hurtful to him&s;elf, for no other Rea&s;on but merely that he may gratify his own Will.</HI> And this gives the Idea of <HI>po&s;itive blind</HI> Self-Will; In&s;tances of which are very frequent in Life. He concludes, <HI>that Self-Love is found a|mong all Ranks, and in all Conditions: it lives every where, it lives upon every thing; nay, it lives upon nothing! It finds its account even in the mo&s;t rigid Au&s;teri|ties, hoping (it &s;eems) to get the Reputa|tion of Sanctity in exchange. This,</HI> (&s;ays
<PB N="252" REF="260">
he) <HI>is a lively Repre&s;entation of Self-Love, the continual Agitation whereof may be compared to the re&s;tle&s;s ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> makes u&s;e of the &s;ame Image<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lvii. 20.</NOTE>; <HI>the Wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e Waters ca&s;t up Mire and Dirt.</HI></P>
<P>FROM that De&s;cription of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> (abridged as it is) we may form an Idea of it, as of a bottomle&s;s Gulph, out of which i&s;&s;ue tho&s;e three Rivers of <HI>Pride, Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;uality</HI>; as there is no|thing that proceeds out of the corrupt Heart of Man, but may be reduced to one or o|ther of tho&s;e impure Streams, or, as Mr. <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> calls them, <HI>tho&s;e Rivers of Fire.

XXX.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"Man was at fir&s;t created with two kinds of Love; the one for God, the other for him&s;elf: but with this Condition, that the Love for God &s;hould be infinite; that is, with|out any other End but God alone; and that the Love for him&s;elf &s;hould be finite, and leading to God as the End. [<HI>rappor|tant &agrave; Dieu.</HI>] Man in that State not only loved him&s;elf without Sin, but he could not lawfully have cea&s;ed to love him&s;elf. When Sin enter'd into Man, he lo&s;t the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Loves; and the Love of him&s;elf, having remain'd alone in that great Soul of his, which was ca|pable of infinite Love, this Self-Love &s;pread it&s;elf, and overflow'd the va&s;t Space which the Love of God had for&s;aken: and thus he loved him&s;elf alone, and all things for him&s;elf; or, in other Words, he loved him&s;elf infinitely."</Q></P>
<P>THIS Suppo&s;ition of the Fall makes the Inju&s;tice of <HI>Self-Love</HI> certainly no le&s;s than it was before, and the Folly of it infinitely greater. If Man was to love him|&s;elf when he was uncorrupted and intire, only with &s;uch an inferiour and &s;ubordinate kind of Love as Mr. <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> repre&s;ents, &s;hall he love him&s;elf now in his Corruption and Mi&s;ery, with &s;uch a &s;upreme and ulti|mate Love, as if he were the Deity it&s;elf?

This is a thing that even &s;ome of the Dei&s;ts exclaim again&s;t, as the highe&s;t Extravagance; and it is &s;hocking to common Sen&s;e, tho' Chri&s;tianity were out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee Mr. <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> does not pretend to account for the Fall of Man, but only tells by way of Hi&s;tory, <Q REND="inline">"That <HI>when Sin en|ter'd,</HI> his Condition was &s;o very much changed, that he is now over&s;pread, as with a loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No III.</NOTE>."</Q> But what Idea can we have of Sin?

And what is this Apo&s;tacy, but &s;ome Defection in our own favour, the Source of which &s;eems to have been Pride?

<HEAD>SECT. III. What may be call'd lawful in SELF-LOVE, from &s;ome of its improper Acceptations.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Art or Addre&s;s, which the Di|vine Wi&s;dom has implanted in every living Creature for its own Good, is often call'd <HI>Self-Pre&s;ervation,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Self-Love</HI>; tho' it is thus common to all Animals, and is no more than an Impul&s;e or Determination towards their own Safety. Every Animal is <HI>dear to it&s;elf,</HI> without thinking of it; and at the approach of any Danger, we find a &s;udden Effort u&s;ed for <HI>Self-Defence</HI>; as when we are falling, we naturally throw out our Arms. The want of this Care and Addre&s;s would be Stupi|dity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Divine Wi&s;dom, which is al|&s;o call'd <HI>Nature,</HI> has added to the Impul&s;e of Self-Pre&s;ervation, another Impul&s;e in every living Creature towards its Ea&s;e or its Delights. And tho' in rational Creatures we hear much of <HI>a De&s;ire of Happine&s;s,</HI> and they actually have it; yet it operates of|ten without Reflection, or any deliberate Project and De&s;ign. If this De&s;ire be call'd natural Good-Will to our&s;elves, Self-Affec|tion,
<PB N="256" REF="264">
or even Self-Love, there is no harm in any of the Terms, if we but allow of a Principle of Good-Will towards other Crea|tures upon their proper account, as well as upon our own; that is, if we allow of a De&s;ire of Good to them, as well as of Good to our &s;elves. In both Ca&s;es the Benevo|lence, or De&s;ire of Good operates fir&s;t; Rea&s;on &s;erving to direct us in the Choice of proper Objects, and the Means of Happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN rational Creatures, (when they act rationally) the De&s;ire of Happine&s;s is the &s;ame with the De&s;ire of Perfection. Here is meant the highe&s;t Happine&s;s. When a Man di&s;covers the Dignity of his Nature, he immediately wi&s;hes to arrive at all the Excellency he is capable of: and his Good-Will to him&s;elf, far from being extingui&s;hed, is put under new Regulations.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion at pre&s;ent is not, how we come to di&s;cover our Dignity, whether by our own natural Light, or a &s;upernatural? All the De&s;ign is to &s;hew that the De&s;ire of Happine&s;s in general, was before that Di&s;|covery, and continues after it, independent of Rea&s;on; the due Exerci&s;e of which, would indeed inform us that our Happine&s;s mu&s;t be founded in the di&s;intere&s;ted Pur&s;uit of Truth and Ju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. The De&s;ires of MAN, con&s;idered more particularly.</HEAD>
<P>WE may therefore con&s;ider in Man, the&s;e &s;everal kinds of De&s;ire. 1. A De&s;ire of &s;imple Exi&s;tence. 2. A De&s;ire of Ea&s;e or Indolence: 3. A more po&s;itive De|&s;ire of Plea&s;ure, either for the Body or the Mind; and, 4. A De&s;ire of Perfection or true Happine&s;s, which is only to be found in the Love of the Sovereign Beauty and Goodne&s;s. The three fir&s;t De&s;ires are na|tural, and can only be call'd criminal, in &s;o far as Inju&s;tice or Vice enters into them: the fourth mu&s;t have been natural to Man in his original State, tho' it is not &s;o natural in the pre&s;ent; and therefore now appears to be rather a divine De&s;ire, than a natural: &s;o rare and &s;o languid is the De&s;ire of Perfec|tion! Nor, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be in the &s;tronge&s;t Degree, would it be virtuous; unle&s;s it were animated by the Love of Truth and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remember'd, that the Idea of Love implies more than &s;imple De&s;ire: it &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome Acquaintance and Notion of the Object, which it e&s;teems, and with which it de&s;ires to be united: 'tis a &s;ecret Attraction, and the Plea&s;ure or Charm is
<PB N="258" REF="266">
derived from the Object. Whereas De&s;ire is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be only blind Appetite, in which the Under&s;tanding has no &s;hare, and the Value of the Object is not con&s;i|dered. It mu&s;t be remember'd too, that even Love, the more it is &s;truck with the Beauty of the Object, will &s;till act with le&s;s Reflection on it&s;elf, and &s;till have its own Intere&s;t le&s;s in view. This may be apply'd to Love in general, which is often call'd blind, as well as De&s;ire: but where the Ob|ject is &s;uppos'd worthy of the Affection, <HI>blind</HI> is too har&s;h an Epithet; &s;ince no more can be meant, but that the Heart is capti|vated, and, only if it be unrea&s;onably &s;o, is the Love to be call'd blind or blinded.</P>
<P>BESIDES the &s;everal De&s;ires above|mention'd, Nature has farther implanted in us, a De&s;ire of the Approbation of others, our own not being &s;ufficient to &s;upport us; which &s;eems to be founded on a tacit Re|&s;pect, that all Mankind have for one ano|ther, or a Conviction of the Dignity of hu|man Nature. With all which De&s;ires there is a Self-Complacency, almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;uppos'd to attend us, and to have been wi&s;e|ly given to reconcile us to our low State, and to &s;upport us again&s;t the Contempt of others. But the Self-Complacency here &s;up|pos'd to be without fault, is a quite different Thing from that which was &s;poke of in the foregoing Sections, as implying either Folly
<PB N="259" REF="267">
or Arrogance, or both: and the De&s;ire of Approbation is an additional Tye upon Men to ob&s;erve the Rules of Humanity, and all good Order.</P>
<P>NOW as the Gratification of all our law|ful De&s;ires (lawfully pur&s;ued) may be call'd our true Intere&s;t, &s;o this Intere&s;t cannot properly be call'd <HI>Self-Love</HI>; becau&s;e a very great Degree of that Principle may be found in the Pur&s;uit of Things altogether de&s;tructive. If it &s;hall be &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That it is not a right <HI>Self-Love</HI> that makes Men pur&s;ue &s;uch de&s;tructive Things,"</Q> it may be &s;aid ju&s;t as well, <Q REND="inline">"That it is not a right Pride, or a right Covetou&s;ne&s;s that makes Men pur&s;ue them:"</Q> which would not be a very &s;ignificant Way of &s;peaking.</P>

<P>IT is not indeed in our power to put things always to that Touch&s;tone, and we may be impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Appearances: but we know well in the general, whence the Worth is derived, and fail not to pro|nounce Things both <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>worthle&s;s,</HI> when no Intere&s;t of our own can po&s;&s;ibly determine us.

And however intere&s;ted the common Friend&s;hips of the World may be, yet every Man in his particular Profe&s;&s;ions thereof di&s;claims any View to Intere&s;t; being &s;en|&s;ible that a Friend&s;hip founded upon that Bottom, is but mere Traffick and Merchan|di&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. NATURAL LOVE con&s;idered under different Denominations.</HEAD>
<P>AS all Love implies both a De&s;ire of ob|taining the beloved Object, and a Delight in it after it is obtain'd; Self-Love in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Views is Non&s;en&s;e, and in the &s;econd, 'tis the next thing to Delu|&s;ion: nay, if the Complacency exceed the due Bounds, no Delu&s;ion can be greater. 'Tis &s;illy and fooli&s;h in the eye of the World.</P>
<P>BUT there are three &s;orts of Love, all granted to be natural, and even rea&s;onable; our Love to our Children, our Love to the Sex, and our Love to our Friends. If any of the&s;e Loves is right, or what it ought to be, <HI>Self-Love</HI> is wholly out of doors: at lea&s;t, the more perfect they are, it has pro|portionably the le&s;s place. A Father loves his Children by a happy In&s;tinct (or what|ver it be call'd) without a View either of Profit or Plea&s;ure from them; for, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><HI>Liberis con&s;ultum volumus, etiam&s;i po&s;thumi futuri &s;unt, propter ip&s;os.</HI> <BIBL>De &s;inibus.</BIBL></Q></NOTE><HI>Ci|cero</HI> &s;ays, we wi&s;h them to be happy after we are gone. The Plea&s;ure that may fol|low upon loving, is by no means the Cau&s;e
<PB N="268" REF="276">
of the Love. Nature has wi&s;ely and kindly de&s;ign'd that every Man &s;hould take care of his own Children in the fir&s;t place: the Care and Affection of Mothers is yet more remarkable: and what Tenderne&s;s is there ob&s;erved, even in Nur&s;es! The Love of Children to their Parents, not being &s;o much determin'd by In&s;tinct, has been &s;ometimes call'd Piety.</P>
<P>AS to the In&s;tinct by which Parents are &s;aid to love their Children, a <HI>burle&s;que</HI> Que&s;tion has been ask'd, <HI>viz.</HI> If this Love be an In&s;tinct free of Selfi&s;hne&s;s, whence is it, that they feel that In&s;tinct for other People's Children, when they believe them to be their own; and on the contrary, feel no &s;uch In&s;tinct for their own, when by Accident they are ignorant of the Relation? If a &s;erious An&s;wer was to be given, this perhaps might be it, That the Que&s;tion makes neither for Selfi&s;hne&s;s nor again&s;t it, and that in &s;uch Ca&s;es, Nature is hoodwink'd; but &s;till the End is obtain'd, which is the caring for the young helple&s;s Creatures.</P>
<P>THE Love to the Sex is a more delicate Article. Every body knows what the De&s;ire of continuing their own Species leads them to: this is hardly to be call'd <HI>Love</HI>; and if any will call it <HI>Self-Love,</HI> they mu&s;t allow other Animals the &s;ame <HI>cool, deliberate</HI> Motives of proceeding. 'Tis plain, that
<PB N="269" REF="277">
when a Man is heartily in love, all Self-Con&s;iderations (Provi&s;ions and Settlements) mu&s;t yield; and the Lover will pur&s;ue his Aim, unle&s;s an extraordinary Principle of Ju&s;tice, or Regard for the Per&s;on, make him lay it a&s;ide. And this too is honou|rable for Love, that the Mind is fir&s;t engaged by the Qualities of the Woman: If Fancy now and then gives the Object a Value, which in reality it has not, this is &s;till ano|ther thing than <HI>Self-Love</HI>; the Man is <HI>taken:</HI> and there ari&s;es not only a De&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, but he feels a Tenderne&s;s as a Parent does for a Child; and for proof of this we may appeal to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><HI>Dilexi tum te, non tantum ut Vulgus Amicam,</HI></L><L><HI>Sed Pater ut Gnatos diligit &amp; Generos.</HI></L> <BIBL>Ad Lesbiam.</BIBL></Q></NOTE><HI>Catullus.</HI> Whatever the Body may claim for its &s;hare, this can|not be &s;aid to proceed from Reflection; but is rather a kind of mechanical &s;weet Im|pul&s;e.</P>
<P>LOVE then is a Concurrence of Ardor, Re&s;pect, and Tenderne&s;s. But &s;ome People &s;eem hardly to have a right Notion of any &s;ort of <HI>Love,</HI> when they &s;uppo&s;e we mu&s;t &s;till be rea&s;oning and reflecting in it, with a View to our own Intere&s;t. An old Natu|rali&s;t &s;peaks more Sen&s;e upon the Love he treats of:<Q><L>Unde feritur e&ograve; tendit&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278">
AND 'tis remarkable that <HI>Lucretius</HI>'s Metaphor here agrees with the modern Phi|lo&s;ophy of Gravitation. And indeed St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;peaks of Love in general, as a Weight or Force by which we are carry'd: <HI>Amor meus, pondus meum,</HI> &amp;c. But it &s;eems the Love of our Philo&s;ophers &s;its very light upon them: they think they may put it in their Pocket, like their Gloves.</P>
<P>THE Love that enters into Friend&s;hip, is only free of that Ardor which tends to the Sex, but is accompany'd with no le&s;s Re|&s;pect, and little le&s;s Tenderne&s;s, &s;ave what the Weakne&s;s or Delicacy of the Sex calls for at the hands of the &s;tronger. But the Power of Love among Friends is &s;ufficient|ly known, and remarkably expre&s;s'd in the&s;e Words of <HI>Mo&s;es, If the Wife of thy Bo|&s;om, or thy Friend whom thou love&s;t as thine own Soul,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>'TIS evident now, that wherever Love enters, the Delight is from the Object, not from <HI>Self:</HI> the Per&s;on is delighted, or plea|&s;ed, but the Plea&s;ure is not from him&s;elf; &s;ince he receives it from &s;omewhat el&s;e. If they &s;ay he &s;till loves the Object from Self-Intere&s;t, or his Intere&s;t is the Cau&s;e of his Love, this is contrary to Nature: and as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;eems to reject the Suppo&s;ition in the Ca&s;e of Friend&s;hip, <HI>Cicero</HI> is more ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="271" REF="279">
and full upon it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. XII.</NOTE>He &s;hews excel|lently, <Q REND="inline">"That Love is the Principle and Motive which engages us in Friend&s;hip: that Intere&s;t or Profit may be made even by a Friend&s;hip which is but acted; but in true Friend&s;hip all is for the &s;ake of the Friend, all is free, genuine, and real. Therefore (adds he) Love appears to be founded on Nature, and not on our Ne|ce&s;&s;ities and Occa&s;ions; on a certain Reli&s;h and Bent of the Soul, (<HI>applica|tione Animi</HI>) rather than any Thoughts of reaping Profit. That tho' Intere&s;t may attend Friend&s;hip, yet it is not the Aim of it. But (he &s;ays) mo&s;t People chu&s;e their Friends, as they do their Cattle, to make a Gain of them; and therefore have no Experience of that mo&s;t beautiful and natural Friend&s;hip, by which we love a Friend for him&s;elf, and cultivate Friend|&s;hip for its own Value. That, in &s;hort, as we love our&s;elves without a View to any Reward at our own hands, we ought to love our Friend after the &s;ame man|ner: for to love one, is to cheri&s;h him for his own &s;ake, without any Regard to our own Indigence or Intere&s;t."</Q> Much more will be found to this purpo&s;e, in that excellent little Treati&s;e upon Friend&s;hip. He &s;uppo&s;es all along that Virtue or per&s;onal Worth is to be the Cement of Friend&s;hip, and the only thing that can render it dura|ble: and he reckons the Charms of Virtue
<PB N="272" REF="280">
&s;o great, that we cannot but love it, even in tho&s;e we have never &s;een, and can never hope to &s;ee, and from whom 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can receive any Advantage.</P>
<P>THE only Eva&s;ion &s;ome have fallen up|on, is, that we love for the Plea&s;ure we find in loving; and &s;o 'tis &s;till (&s;ay they) Self-In|tere&s;t at the bottom. But this, as it would take away the Di&s;tinction of Vice and Vir|tue, and imply a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity, without leaving any thing to Rea&s;on; &s;o it is plainly a mi&s;taking the Effect for the Cau&s;e: we are attracted fir&s;t, and &s;eiz'd on by the Object, without De&s;ign upon either &s;ide; unle&s;s on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, where certain agreeable intelligent Objects are &s;aid to lay Traps for Lovers, by &s;hewing their own Charms: but then this Forwardne&s;s of appearing, which the Sex is &s;ometimes accus'd of, proceeds more from Curio&s;ity and a De&s;ire of A|mu&s;ement, than of exciting Love, or even of drawing common Admirers. But this is a Speculation foreign from the Purpo&s;e: whatever be in it, the natural Attraction, whether Love or Friend&s;hip, is accompany'd with a certain Sweetne&s;s in which we are but pa&s;&s;ive, and can challenge nothing of it as our own Contrivance. Plea&s;ure is the Re&s;ult of Friend&s;hip, not the Inducement to it.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="281">
NOW if the Con&s;titution of our Nature is &s;uch, that Plea&s;ure is in&s;eparable from loving our Friends, and doing them friendly Offices, this is the Contrivance of our Maker, and we cannot alter our Frame: nor have we any rea&s;on to wi&s;h it altered, be|cau&s;e our Maker &s;eems thereby to have de|&s;ign'd that Self Love &s;hould be &s;wallow'd up by a more generous Principle, in which our Nature finds its account, without laying a Plot for it. And as Genero&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in giving, not in receiving, our Saviour de|clares, <HI>that to give is more ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> At this rate one would think Friend&s;hip &s;hould not be &s;uch a Rarity, &s;ince &s;o much Plea&s;ure at|tends it: But let <HI>Self</HI> an&s;wer for that. 'Tis enough for us to have the agreeable Convic|tion, that our Nature is capable of a finer Ca&s;t; and they who would re&s;olve every thing into &s;ordid Intere&s;t, do only argue from the Abu&s;e of our Faculties, without a right Knowledge of the natural U&s;e of them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Of other Engagements of the AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDE the three kinds of Love mention'd in the la&s;t Section, there are other things more properly call'd At|tachments than Love; &s;uch as the Concern about one's Family, &s;eparate from the Love to Children, and the lawful Concern we ought to have for our Po&s;terity and Kindred, which lies in the De&s;ire of having Repre|&s;entatives, and keeping up a mere Name. We &s;hall hardly di&s;cover a Foundation for this Love in Nature, unle&s;s it be &s;aid to pro|ceed from an Abhorrence of Extinction, or from an Anxiety that at lea&s;t a <HI>Sound</HI> &s;hould remain after us to keep us from being for|got.

<P>TO this &s;ort of Love, the Love of our Country is frequently &s;acrificed. But there is a nearer kind of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> which gets the better even of it: for we &s;ee good E&s;tates <HI>play'd away,</HI> or otherwi&s;e &s;quander'd, ac|cording to the Humour of the Proprietors.
<PB N="275" REF="283">
And the&s;e will be call'd no extraordinary Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>THE Love of our Country has more of Nature in it than the former, as if it was an In&s;tinct planted by the great Ruler of the Earth, that all the habitable Parts of it might be inhabited with Contentment, and im|proved to the utmo&s;t, without wandering to finer Climates, and di&s;lodging other People: and we &s;ee how alluring the <HI>native Soil</HI> has been in all Ages. But the Love of our Country farther implies (and with greater Rea&s;on) a peculiar Affection and Concern for the Society wherein Providence hath placed us; as if we look'd upon it as the Hou&s;hold we belong to, and which we are therefore chiefly to care for, (the general Law of Humanity always ob&s;erved) as be|ing its mo&s;t immediate and proper Members. However, if that kind of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> which aims no farther than the pre&s;ent Gratification of the Per&s;on, gets the better of the Con|cern for the Family; 'tis no wonder the Concern for the Country is &s;o much forgot, and look'd upon as an old-fa&s;hion'd <HI>&s;imple</HI> Thing. The wife &s;elf-loving Man has no Country, no Family, no Friends; but where he can eat be&s;t, or make the greate&s;t Figure, there he lives.</P>
<P>THERE is a Love which had almo&s;t been pa&s;s'd over, <HI>viz.</HI> Party-Love. It owes its

ri&s;e to <HI>Self-Love</HI> plainly enough, whether it be con&s;idered as an accidental Agreement of Opinions, or a Combination of Intere&s;ts and De&s;igns, without any Cement of Vir|tue, or Regard to Truth.

BUT not to dwell upon Words: if Man was originally upright and uncorrupt, by the Removal of the oppo&s;ite Qualities, he is rein&s;tated in his primitive Integrity; &s;o that an uncorrupt Man is the &s;ame with an upright Man, and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s but ano|ther Term for Uprightne&s;s. This way of &s;peaking therefore, when the Matter is well con&s;ider'd, will pa&s;s both with Chri&s;tians and Dei&s;ts; for both Parties &s;uppo&s;e Man to be originally upright, the latter only de|nying his Defection from that State.

<P>THERE &s;eems to be a natural Love of Ju&s;tice and Order, as there is of Proportion and Harmony. We are pleas'd with a fine Character, as well as with a fine Picture, or fine Mu&s;ick.

In|&s;truction, no doubt, is of great importance, as it helps to cultivate tho&s;e innate Powers of the Soul, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrina &s;ed Vim promovet in&s;itam,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Vis in&s;ita,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> calls it: but that's another Affair.</P>
<P>TO return, a Man <HI>feels</HI> when the Rules of Equity are broke to his own prejudice, and he <HI>&s;ees</HI> when they are broke to the pre|judice of his Neighbour, if the Injury is done by a third Per&s;on; for he does not al|ways &s;ee it when it is done by him&s;elf.

or a more in&s;tantaneous Perception, there is &s;till in Man, fallen as he is; a Fund of Compa&s;&s;ion or Tenderne&s;s, operating in a more warm and feeling manner, without any help of Reflection. And this is ano|ther Source of di&s;intere&s;ted Actions, &s;eated in the Heart (as the former is in the Under|&s;tanding) which yet being but a happy Con|&s;titution of Soul, a Man is no more to value him&s;elf upon it, than upon bodily Health.</P>
<P>PERHAPS Benignity had been a fitter Word than Compa&s;&s;ion, to expre&s;s that af|fectionate Temper which prompts Men <HI>free|ly</HI> to do good to others: but Compa&s;&s;ion came fir&s;t up, and in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s'd State of things, every Man is &s;ome way or other an Object of it; &s;o it may be taken for a general Inclination to relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t. However, Benignity has a more exten&s;ive Signification, not only importing Pity for the Afflicted, but a De&s;ire to &s;ee every body happy, and an Endeavour to make them &s;o: and &s;uch a Temper mu&s;t extend to the whole &s;en&s;ible Creation. <HI>The ju&s;t Man is merciful to his Bea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WHOEVER then has any thing of this compa&s;&s;ionate Temper in him, (as none but a Devil is &s;uppos'd to be wholly void of it) ought to cheri&s;h it carefully: for 'tis a &s;urer and a more fertile Principle of good Actions

than that wherein the Under&s;tanding is only engaged. Mo&s;t Men can <HI>love</HI> better than they can <HI>rea&s;on:</HI> and thus they are to blame who talk of Pity as a contemptible Thing; as <HI>Seneca</HI> call'd it the <HI>Defect</HI> of little Minds: but this great Man was carried away by a fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy, which did not allow what was due to the Affections, and would needs &s;et up for an unnatural &s;tiff Compo|&s;ure that was good for nothing, even &s;up|po&s;ing it to be free from Grimace. Bene|volence generally implies a Warmne&s;s of Heart, and care &s;hould be taken that be not too <HI>cool</HI>; otherwi&s;e it degenerates into In|dolence.</P>
<P>NO doubt the warm Temper ought to be regulated by Di&s;cretion. A Judge, for in&s;tance, is not to be prevail'd on by more Tenderne&s;s for one Party, than the other; but mu&s;t give the Subject in di&s;pute to the Per&s;on who&s;e Right is cleare&s;t, tho' the o|ther may be more nece&s;&s;itous: and Merit is not in the que&s;tion neither. Again, in giving charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance, a Man is not to &s;trip him&s;elf in favour of the fir&s;t Object he meets; but to proportion his Charity &s;o as none may ju&s;tly complain for want of a Share, and <HI>that Mercy may agree with Judgment.</HI> As to our re&s;erving for our own Occa&s;ions, <HI>Self-Love</HI> will readily take care of that.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. Some Acceptations of CONSCIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>CONSCIENCE is either the Sen&s;e of Equity in general, or the Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of our adhering to it; which is &s;uppos'd to carry its Reward along with it, as was &s;aid in an old elegant Speech.<Q><L>&mdash;&amp; Mens &s;ibi con&s;cia recti.</L>
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>AND a good Con&s;cience is call'd in Sa|cred Writ, <HI>a continual Fea&s;t.</HI> If, on the contrary, we are con&s;cious that we have done wrong, or departed from Equity, this Re|flection carries a Pain along with it, as the former carried a Plea&s;ure: and all the Ac|count we can give of tho&s;e different Effects upon our Minds, is, that &s;uch is the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of things. St. <HI>Paul</HI> informs us very plainly, that this Operation of the Mind has been uniform in all Ages of the World: <HI>When</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii.</NOTE><HI>the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law; the&s;e having not the Law, are a Law to them&s;elves: which &s;hews the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="291">
<HI>their Thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c. He &s;ays in another place, <HI>He had kept a Con&s;cience void of Offence towards God and towards Men.</HI> So that Con&s;cience may be con&s;ider'd as one of the Powers or Faculties of the Mind, like an Ear for Mu&s;ick; with this difference, that &s;ome few Per&s;ons have got no Ear, but no Man was ever without &s;ome Con&s;cience. The Ta&s;te indeed may be corrupted, and &s;o it fares with Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THIS View of Con&s;cience, as a natural Reli&s;h of moral Rectitude, and not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> gives that Definition in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Human Under&s;tanding:</HI> and arguing again&s;t innate Principles, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"If Con&s;cience be a Proof of innate Principles, Con|traries may be innate Principles; &s;ince &s;ome Men with the &s;ame Bent of Con&s;cience pro&s;ecute what others avoid."</Q> But this Argument wou'd &s;eem to &s;trike mo&s;t again&s;t Virtue, as it &s;eems to take away the Difference of Right and Wrong, or to render every thing &s;o arbitrary and uncertain, that an Appeal could not be made to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind in no Ca&s;e what&s;oever. But Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> cannot be &s;u&s;pected to have had &s;o bad an Intention: the Regard he expre&s;s'd for the Chri&s;tian Religion, as well as moral Virtue, is &s;uffi|cient to clear him from &s;uch an Imputation. 'Tis remark|able too, that &s;ome profe&s;t Dei&s;ts not only &s;et up for the <HI>moral Sen&s;e,</HI> but al&s;o acknowledge the innate Principles, which they call (after <HI>Epictetus</HI>) Anticipations, or previous Notices of the Mind.</NOTE><HI>merely our own Opinion or Judgment of the moral Rectitude or Pravity of our own Actions,</HI> (as an ingenious Author defin'd it) will help to &s;olve &s;ome Difficulties ari&s;ing from the different Opinions of Men, (particularly Chri&s;tians) and their mutual Per&s;ecutions; each Party really thinking them&s;elves in the

right. For it is to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Differences are chiefly in Matters of Belief, and concerning the Interpretation of re|veal'd Doctrines, and that all Parties are ne|verthele&s;s agreed in the Principles of Ju&s;tice and natural Equity. For in&s;tance, every one's Con&s;cience declares to him, that God is to be honoured in the mo&s;t perfect Man|ner: &s;o that the Di&s;pute comes only to be, what is the mo&s;t perfect Manner? As to which, (tho' Men mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di|vided, &s;o long as they differ in the Inter|pretation of what has been reveal'd, or do not all equally agree upon the things that are to be received as Revelation) their Con|&s;ciences (if they would hearken to them) would tell them that they ought to love one another, notwith&s;tanding any &s;uch Diffe|rences of Thinking. But Hurry, Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and Intere&s;t, darken the Under&s;tanding; making People take human Inventions for the Commands of God, or le&s;s earne&s;t to ob&s;erve <HI>the weightier things of the Law,</HI> than the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Ceremonies. But this Confu&s;ion of the Judgment does not infer that we have no &s;uch Faculty, &s;ince it might be as rea&s;onably &s;aid we have no Sight, becau&s;e &s;ometimes we do not &s;ee clearly. Nor is Chri&s;tianity to be charged with the Per&s;ecutions among the different Sects and Parties, which its Enemies make a handle of in their Arguments again&s;t it: for Religion is commonly but a Pretence for
<PB N="285" REF="293">
&s;uch Severities, the Quarrel rather ri&s;ing from Ambition, or Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or both. And if blind Zeal or Fury, without any o|ther Mixture (which is even very rare) &s;hould really be the Cau&s;e of the Severities, what more could the Founder of the Chri|&s;tian Religion do, to inform Men's Under|&s;tandings, than by making their Love to one another, the principal Mark of being <HI>his Di&s;ciples?</HI> If People will call them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians (as each Party call them|&s;elves the only Chri&s;tians) and yet retain their Pride and Ill-Humour, and all the Vices of Nature, is Chri&s;tianity ju&s;tly to be blam'd for that? They who thus blame it, as they are no le&s;s corrupt than the Chri|&s;tians, are al&s;o guilty of a manife&s;t piece of unfair Dealing; &s;ince any body that can read, may &s;ee what the Go&s;pel requires, and what it forbids.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame View of Con&s;cience, as a natural Sen&s;e of Equity, may help to &s;ettle the Debate about <HI>innate Ideas,</HI> which is not now &s;o high as it was &s;ome Years ago: for it needs not be a&s;&s;erted, that we came into the World with the Ideas of Virtue, or Dictates of Morality, no more than with the Ideas of Squares and Triangles, and their &s;everal Properties. 'Tis enough that the Mind ripens as to its Comprehen&s;ion of Truths both <HI>geometrical</HI> and <HI>moral:</HI> and whatever may be call'd <HI>Science</HI> in either, is

only as it were an Evolution of &s;ome fir&s;t Principles which Mankind are agreed upon; and &s;o in Matters of Right and Wrong there lies an Appeal to the moral or internal Sen&s;e, as in mathematical Demon&s;trations there lies an Appeal to the external.</P>
<P>IT was very agreeable to find that Sir <HI>Matthew Hale</HI> had a&s;&s;erted both <HI>the moral Sen&s;e,</HI> and the moral Dictates, in a Di&s;|cour&s;e on our Saviour's Precept of <HI>doing as we would be done to.</HI> Here are a few of his Words: <Q REND="inline">"As <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contemplat.

<P>OUR Saviour has in a manner propos'd &s;uch a Tran&s;po&s;ition of Per&s;ons in that &s;ame glorious Precept, when he &s;ays, <HI>Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</HI> And he has made the Command univer&s;al and ab&s;olute, without any prudential Limitations which <HI>Self-Love</HI> would be too ready to &s;ugge&s;t. But the &s;ame natural Rea&s;on which &s;ees the Fitne&s;s of the Command, &s;ees al&s;o where the Tran&s;po&s;ition is to take place; and that the Precept is not de&s;ign'd to defeat Order and Government among Men: as a

<P>A world of things might be &s;aid about Con&s;cience, were it not for fear of being too intricate or too obvious. But 'tis re|markable, that the &s;ame thing which acts within us &s;ometimes as a Judge, acts at o|ther times as an Accu&s;er, and even as an Exe|cutioner: and hence the u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>the La&s;hes of Con&s;cience.</HI> Nor is it any Argument that People have no Con&s;cience, becau&s;e they do not always feel tho&s;e La&s;hes, nor are troubled with any Remor&s;e. For, not to &s;ay that they &s;ometimes feel more than they are willing to own, they are under the power of another Principle (Self-Love) which hinders them from &s;eeing that they have done wrong, or may at fir&s;t pu&s;h them on to commit it, contrary to their plain Con|viction. 'Tis this Liberty they take of doing what they know they &s;hould not, that makes it be &s;aid they have no Con&s;cience, or, which is the &s;ame thing, a large Con&s;cience: both Expre&s;&s;ions importing that they &s;tick at nothing.</P>
<P>IT is not po&s;&s;ible to account for the Difference of Souls in the point of Con|&s;cience: &s;ome have it of a very delicate
<PB N="289" REF="297">
Sen&s;e, others of a very dull one. And this Difference would &s;eem to be in their very Nature, like the Difference of Com|plexion or any thing el&s;e. Why the &s;ame Per&s;on has this Sen&s;e quicker and duller at different times, is another Secret, but the thing is certain in fact: for the &s;ame Temp|tation will prevail at one time, that would have no force at another.</P>
<P>A &s;crupulous Con&s;cience implies a Defect in the Under&s;tanding, and is a-kin to Super|&s;tition and Bigotry; with this difference, that the&s;e two (which differ very little) often prompt Men to do extravagant Things: whereas Scrupulo&s;ity re&s;trains them from doing what may be very rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>BUT it is not always Scrupulo&s;ity to dif|fer from the current Practice of the Times, the Multitude being an ill Guide; and bare Example &s;trong enough to carry People away, even when neither Intere&s;t nor Plea&s;ure &s;ol|licite.

<HEAD>SECT. XI. The REALITY of VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is &s;uch a thing in Man as Con|&s;cience, there mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;uch a thing as Virtue, tho' this is as hard to define as the former: but the Exi&s;tence of both is di&s;|coverable from the Di&s;tinction of Right and Wrong, and &s;o Virtue may be con&s;idered as the adhering to what is right, the Love|line&s;s of which the Con&s;cience was convin|ced of before. Nor does it &s;trike at the Exi|&s;tence of Virtue, that it is &s;ometimes repre|&s;ented as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No VI.</NOTE>an ab&s;tracted Notion of the Mind; for all Qualities are nothing more, when they are con&s;idered &s;eparately from any particular Subject; and Men &s;peak of &s;uch Qualities that fall under the outward Sen&s;es, as well as of tho&s;e moral Qualities affecting the Mind; as they &s;peak of <HI>Streightne&s;s,</HI> both in Lines and Actions. What is there more common than to talk of <HI>&s;weet</HI> and <HI>bitter,</HI> without joining the&s;e Words to any particular thing ta&s;ted, or any other way per|ceiv'd?</P>
<P>THIS Pedantry &s;eem'd the more allow|able, that &s;ome Men have call'd Virtue, a Chimaera, a Phantom, and at be&s;t an arbi|trary
<PB N="291" REF="299">
thing: but hone&s;t People are at no lo&s;s, when they hear of a virtuous Action, to know whence the Virtue of it proceeds, and they call both Actions and Per&s;ons <HI>good</HI> without he&s;itation; &s;o that Virtue and Goodne&s;s often pa&s;s for the &s;ame thing, and no Confu&s;ion en&s;ues.

<P>AS every body allows that Goodne&s;s is the Object of Love, &s;o Virtue mu&s;t be the Object of it too. Yet there is a &s;ort of Rea|&s;oning, which, if it took place, would de|&s;troy the very Being of Virtue: and that is, when People affirm, <Q REND="inline">"That no Man can love any thing but under the Notion of Good with re&s;pect to him&s;elf."</Q> But this in the fir&s;t place is contrary to Experience, &s;ince we love many things under the Notion of Good with re&s;pect to others, with whom we have not the lea&s;t Connection, and therefore cannot be &s;aid to love tho&s;e things with re&s;pect to our&s;elves. In the &s;econd place, by that rea&s;oning we could acknow|ledge no Difference between Good and Evil, but in &s;o far as we found our Account (or thought we found it) in the one or the o|ther: or, in other Words, the Goodne&s;s of things con&s;i&s;ting only in their being good to

us, or giving us plea&s;ure, the Ideas of Good|ne&s;s and Virtue would be &s;wallow'd up in the &s;ole Idea of Plea&s;ure; and &s;ince vi|cious Per&s;ons mu&s;t be own'd to be pleas'd with their Pur&s;uits, as well as virtuous Per&s;ons are with theirs, the moral Diffe|rence between the&s;e two Parties would va|ni&s;h. I do not &s;ay, that both Parties are equally pleas'd with their Pur&s;uits; but both certainly are pleas'd. Nay, mad People are highly pleas'd with their extravagant Fancies; and where &s;hall the Difference lie between them and the &s;ober, if Plea&s;ure is the only thing to be appeal'd to, and no Ap|peal to be made to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind in their right Wits?

But 'tis po&s;&s;ible his Virtue (without di&s;paragement to him) has been pretty much tinctur'd with the De&s;ire of Ap|plau&s;e, which is empty enough; and like|wi&s;e the Di&s;tre&s;s and Perplexity of his Mind at that time, may have forc'd that Expre&s;&s;ion from him. But <HI>Cicero,</HI> and tho&s;e who wrote of Virtue deliberately, always repre&s;ent it as a real Thing, and infinitely charming.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, tho' the Under&s;tanding may be pleas'd with certain Ideas and Specu|lations of moral Goodne&s;s, and the Heart (&s;uppo&s;ing it hone&s;t) may partake of the Delight; yet the Heart mu&s;t have &s;omething to cleave to, that has Life; &s;ince otherwi&s;e the Affections would not have an adequate or &s;uitable Object: &s;o that (if &s;uch a way of &s;peaking can be allowed) we mu&s;t conceive
<PB N="294" REF="302">
Virtue and Ju&s;tice, and all that's lovely, even Love it&s;elf; as it were <HI>in Per&s;on,</HI> or united to an intellectual Nature.</P>
<P>VIRTUE then is &s;till a real Thing, whatever way it be &s;uppos'd to affect Men: and there can hardly be a greater Proof of its Reality, than the melancholy State tho&s;e are reduc'd to, <HI>who &s;ee it and for&s;ake it.</HI> If a Cur&s;e was to be wi&s;h'd to any, there could be none imagin'd heavier:<Q><L>Virtutem videant, intabe&s;cantque re|lict&acirc;.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Plea&s;ure that's found in the Practice of Virtue, is much owing to the Reli&s;h or good Ta&s;te of the Soul. But as this Ta&s;te is much vitiated &s;ince the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> Vir|tue is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented as a very un|ea&s;y Thing; and no doubt is &s;o, in many re&s;pects: for if it were &s;o very natural and ea&s;y as &s;ome make it, our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Precept of Self-Denial would be &s;uperfluous; and if it were &s;o very unnatural and hard as o|thers make it, his declaring <HI>that his Yoke is ea&s;y,</HI> would not be agreeable to Truth. But that which is ea&s;y to Nature in a State of Order, is not &s;o in a State of Di&s;order; for Nature is one thing, and corrupt Nature another: and they who never heard of the Di&s;tinction, nor of the Fall, had rea|&s;on to recommend <HI>a Life according to Na|ture</HI>;
<PB N="295" REF="303">
and to maintain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Nunquam aliud Natura, aliud Sapientia aixit.</HI> <BIBL>Juv.

<P>NOW what makes Virtue unea&s;y at any rate, but &s;ome unhappy Turn of Nature, &s;ome Poi&s;on of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> &s;omething that is not right, whatever Name it get?

<HEAD>SECT. XII. RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>AS &dagger; Religion is principally meant of Man's Duty towards God, it is there|fore con&s;idered as a higher Thing than Vir|tue: yet if the Di&s;tinction of natural and 
<PB N="296" REF="304">
divine Virtue, be admitted, the highe&s;t Things in Religion will &s;uffer no di&s;pa|ragement in being call'd <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the De&s;ign here, and all along, is only to give a general View of Religion, and to confront it with <HI>Self-Love,</HI> in order to &s;ee how far it gains or lo&s;es by its being mixed with that Principle.</P>
<P>IF a formal Definition of Religion were to be ask'd, perhaps that might do well enough (with &s;ome variation) which the Civil Law gives of Ju&s;tice, <HI>viz. a con&s;tant and perpetual Will to render every one his Due.</HI> A Man cannot be &s;aid to have Re|ligion, unle&s;s he hath a Love for Ju&s;tice; and this Love ought to be in a very great De|gree, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath made u&s;e of the Words <HI>Hunger</HI> and <HI>Thir&s;t,</HI> and placed it in the Number of the Beatitudes: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS very true, the above Definition re|pre&s;ents Religion as a Thing that's <HI>internal</HI>; and lying chiefly in the Heart: but this does not take away the Idea, nor the Ob|ligation of <HI>external</HI> Religion, which con|&s;i&s;ts in outward Practices, either <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>in&s;tituted</HI>; no more than the actual <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of Ju&s;tice is taken away, by the <HI>perpetual Inclination</HI> of doing ju&s;tly. Virtue and
<PB N="297" REF="305">
Vice both are internal Things, breaking out according to the Occa&s;ions that fall in our way. We call tho&s;e Practices of Religion <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> or <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> the Rea&s;ons whereof do not appear clearly to us, tho' there may be good Rea&s;ons for them in the Wi&s;dom of God; if it was but to make them the Figures of higher Things, and to excite the dull Affections, by &s;triking on the outward Sen&s;es. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies were re|markably calculated for that purpo&s;e: And Chri&s;tians will hardly di&s;own that they have need to be awaken'd by &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ions. But this by the way.</P>
<P>THERE is a more expre&s;s Definition of Religion, given by a late Author; which rai&s;es the Idea of Ju&s;tice very high: 'tis in the&s;e Words; <HI>Religion then is nothing but a re&s;pectful Wor&s;hip of Ju&s;tice and Truth, which makes us treat God as God, and the Creatures as Creatures.</HI> Perhaps few Defi|nitions will be found more exact, and there is none that captious Spirits will not cen&s;ure: this at lea&s;t agrees with Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI>'s Rule<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Religion of Nature.</NOTE>, <HI>to treat things as they are.</HI> 'Tis al&s;o very plain, that the true&s;t Wor&s;hip con|&s;i&s;ts in Imitation, and Imitation is the Effect of Love: &s;o that whatever Ideas we form of Religion, if they be form'd right, they all hang together in an Order that may be call'd
<PB N="298" REF="306">
natural, and whereof Rea&s;on it&s;elf may &s;ee the Con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>AS to Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton,</HI> his Rule is mo&s;t ju&s;t: but then we can make no more of it, but <HI>to treat things</HI> only as they appear to us, or according to the Notions we have of them; and however imperfect the&s;e may be, we may be &s;aid to act ju&s;tly if we follow our Light. But the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, who tells us <HI>that the Gentiles do by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law,</HI> tells us al&s;o <HI>that the natural Man knoweth not the Things of God</HI>; and <HI>that they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> The Things therefore contain'd in the Law &s;hould &s;eem to be tho&s;e Acts of Humanity and natural Ju&s;tice, which we find in&s;tances of in all Times and Places; and the Things of God may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be meant both of his un&s;earchable Nature, and the My|&s;teries of Religion, which are but reveal'd as it were hi&s;torically, or <HI>that they are,</HI> not <HI>how they are</HI>; and therefore, as the Apo&s;tle concludes, only to be <HI>di&s;cern'd</HI> by a &s;piri|tual Light.</P>
<P>THE natural Ignorance of Man will ea&s;ily be confe&s;s'd by tho&s;e who acknowledge re|veal'd Religion: and let tho&s;e who deny it tell us hone&s;tly what things they know <HI>really,</HI> or in their true Nature. Indeed the Rule <HI>of treating things as they are,</HI> holds very well as to certain Relations and Cha|racters:
<PB N="299" REF="307">
Parents, for in&s;tance, ought to be treated as Parents, and Children as Children; and &s;o of other Relations. Again, People of Worth are to be treated in a different Manner from the Worthle&s;s; and in all Ca&s;es, Prudence and Equity (which are never &s;eparate) will know how to di&s;tribute and render what is due to every Relation and Character.</P>
<P>BY thus con&s;idering the Difference of Relations and Characters, we may form &s;ome imperfect Notions of our Duty, even to our Maker and the Creator of all Things. If we &s;uppo&s;e a Being of infinite Power, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, the Obligations of Fear, Reverence and Love naturally ari&s;e: Rea&s;on it&s;elf goes &s;o far, as to make that plain Inference and Conclu&s;ion. Nor can we hinder our&s;elves from making &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, if we allow Rea&s;on any Exer|ci&s;e at all. We &s;ee and feel enough to per|&s;uade us of the Exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Sove|reign Being, unle&s;s we are &s;tupid or hurry'd out of our Reflection. Tho' we cannot comprehend the divine Nature, we cannot fail to &s;ee <HI>that it is</HI>; el&s;e we mu&s;t fall into the Ab&s;urdities of imagining Things that are made, to have made them&s;elves, or to have been made by nothing; or el&s;e to con|found the Maker and the Works together, like <HI>Spinoza</HI>; who, in that point, imitated
<PB N="300" REF="308">
&s;ome of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> and (with them) is imitated by later Authors.</P>
<P>RELIGION now is principally to be taken for the Duties we owe to God: What we owe to Men is u&s;ually call'd <HI>Morality,</HI> tho' it is al&s;o a con&s;iderable Part of Religion, as being enjoin'd by God, who puts no va|lue on any thing we do to &s;hew our Homage to him, if we neglect our Duties to our Neighbour. This is confirm'd by many Places of Scripture.</P>
<P>RELIGION al&s;o may be divided into the <HI>internal</HI> and the <HI>external,</HI> and this a|gain into the <HI>moral</HI> and the <HI>ceremonial.</HI> What a Man hath of the internal, can only be known to God; and the <HI>external</HI> will only be approved by him, as it proceeds from the <HI>internal.</HI> To in&s;tance even in the moral Part; Giving of Alms (which is of more value than going to Church) is rejected by God, when it is done only <HI>to be &s;een of Men</HI>; or it is &s;o far rejected, as it is tinctur'd with that Principle: for our Saviour told the Phari&s;ees, <HI>they had already their Re|ward.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS true, the ceremonial Part of Religion is much aboli&s;hed by the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen|&s;ation (the Jewi&s;h Ceremonies certainly are) and the few In&s;titutions or po&s;itive Precepts in it may de&s;erve a higher Character; tho'
<PB N="301" REF="309">
&s;till they are but Ceremonies, when the Heart does not go along with them. What el&s;e is taking the Communion to &s;ecure an Employment? Bapti&s;m al&s;o is a Matter of Parade in the Parents for the mo&s;t part, and the Children generally think as little about it when they come to Age, as in their Infancy. There is this Difference there|fore between the <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive</HI> In&s;ti|tutions, that the former are of u&s;e to others, even tho' they are not done from a right Principle; but the latter, unle&s;s they be done from a right Principle, are good for nothing.</P>
<P>BUT true Religion, as it contains all Vir|tues, &s;o it will not omit any the lea&s;t Ob|&s;ervances, whether it may think them ap|pointed by God, or Men having his Autho|rity; nay, tho' it is not &s;o &s;ure of the Au|thority, it will &s;ubmit for Peace &s;ake, when the things enjoin'd &s;eem to impart no Di&s;|advantage to Society, nor any Di&s;honour to the divine Nature.</P>
<P>'TIS only with reference to that Di&s;|advantage and Di&s;honour, that the Di&s;tinc|tion of true and fal&s;e Religion has come in u&s;e: for fal&s;e Religion is no Religion. There is in|deed a Difference between the di&s;owning all Religion (which is Athei&s;m) and the De|fects ari&s;ing either from the Confu&s;ion of
<PB N="302" REF="310">
the Under&s;tanding, or the Perver&s;ene&s;s of the Will; and the la&s;t is by far the unhap|pie&s;t. Bigotry and Super&s;tition flow from a di&s;turb'd Under&s;tanding. Blind Zeal or religious Fury ari&s;es more from the Temper or Complexion, if the&s;e are proper Words; and what is call'd Enthu&s;ia&s;m is generally from the &s;ame Fountain. I have no inten|tion to enquire into all the Sources of Error. But Religion (which may be call'd <HI>the Wi&s;|dom that cometh from above</HI>) <HI>is fir&s;t pure, and then peaceable,</HI> &amp;c. Hypocri&s;y does not even de&s;erve the Name of fal&s;e Reli|gion: 'tis a Cheat upon the World, either to get Money or Applau&s;e, or both, when they can be had.</P>
<P>How many things may be added on this Subject! But I &s;hall refer to a few Hints in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. V.</NOTE>Appendix, from which the Reader will ea&s;ily draw a thou&s;and more.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. The Unfitne&s;s of SELF, as an Object of LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>THE common Ideas of <HI>Love, Happi|ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;hew pretty evi|dently what rank Self-Love &s;hould &s;tand in. Some Per&s;ons indeed &s;eem to be fond of the very Word: but if they mean by it <HI>the De|&s;ire of Happine&s;s,</HI> 'tis plain we ought to de&s;ire the Happine&s;s of all Men, and thus we &s;hould fulfil the Command of <HI>loving our Neighbours as our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as Love implies more properly a Complacency in the Object; what Sen&s;e would it make, if <HI>Self</HI> were &s;aid to be this Object? The Love of other Creatures (that is, an ultimate Acquie&s;cence in them) is ju&s;tly reckon'd an Ab&s;urdity as well as an Impiety, becau&s;e of their natural In&s;uffici|ency to &s;atisfy the Heart. But &s;till they are Supports of a certain kind, which <HI>Self</HI> can|not be, &s;ince it is like a <HI>Void,</HI> that wants other things to fill it. So that the Self-Complacency of a Creature is much of the &s;ame import with <HI>Self-Delu&s;ion</HI>; the No|tion of a Creature always &s;uppo&s;ing Indi|gence. For as the Body cannot be Food to it&s;elf, &s;o the Soul mu&s;t depend for its Nou|ri&s;hment
<PB N="304" REF="312">
upon &s;ome other thing than it&s;elf. And this Difference is to be remember'd be|tween the&s;e two, that the Soul cannot fall to pieces like the Body, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by its unex&s;tingui&s;hable Nature (in Mi&s;ery and Angui&s;h) when its De&s;ires are not &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>'TIS very true, in this &s;hort Dream of Life the Soul has &s;everal De&s;ires; and the&s;e more upon the Body's account than its own: nay, often we cannot &s;ay the things we de&s;ire are of u&s;e, either to Soul or Body; for in&s;tance, <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Ribbons.</HI> But the Fancy (with a mixture of Pride) finds its account in &s;uch things; and to that Source we may refer mo&s;t of the De&s;ires of Men, Women and Children.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hall be &s;aid, that tho&s;e Marks of Di&s;tinction not only draw more Money, but al&s;o the E&s;teem of others; it mu&s;t be on|ly of &s;uch as are fanciful like our&s;elves. A thorow Pride leads to the Contempt of all external Riches and Pomp, that we may be thought &s;ufficient for our&s;elves, like the Phi|lo&s;opher in his Tub. I &s;hall not determine that <HI>Diogenes</HI> was led by the &s;ole De&s;ire of E&s;teem and Admiration, tho' it was &s;o &s;aid by &s;ome of his Contemporaries, who have &s;een his weak &s;ides as he has &s;een theirs: but wherever that De&s;ire prevails, it concludes for the In&s;ufficiency of <HI>Self</HI> as an Object of
<PB N="305" REF="313">
Love or Complacency, &s;ince we cannot be ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> but from without.</P>
<P>NOR can we ever be &s;aid in this Life to be <HI>&s;atisfied,</HI> but only <HI>amu&s;ed</HI> by get|ting one Rattle or Feather after another; (the Delights of Friend&s;hip are not of this Cla&s;s:) and when we come to &s;hake off this Body, and our Stupidity with it, what a State, can we think, the Soul will be in, that has been only accu&s;tomed to delight in Vanity, and follow Shadows; when all its imaginary Buildings are pull'd down, and nothing remains but Remor&s;e, Shame, Horror, and what no Words are &s;uf|ficient to expre&s;s! This is upon the Suppo|&s;ition of a future Life: and Chri&s;tians profe&s;s a Belief even of the Re&s;urrection of the Bo|dy, the Sen&s;es of which will be infinitely more quick, both as to Pain and Plea|&s;ure, than here. Men will make little by their <HI>Self-Love</HI> at the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>As the Con&s;equences of <HI>Self-Love</HI> are &s;uch as have been repre&s;ented, tho' &s;aintly; the Con&s;equences of loving the mo&s;t perfect Object with the mo&s;t perfect Love, are not only Re&s;t and Joy to the Heart, but the whole Man is dignified and exalted. The Under&s;tanding is enlighten'd, and the Heart enlarged, as <HI>David</HI> expre&s;&s;es it. If the di|vine Love po&s;&s;e&s;s'd us, we &s;hould be no lon|ge tho&s;e <HI>little, narrow, proud, angry, con|fus'd</HI>
<PB N="306" REF="314">
<HI>Creatures, &s;hut up in a hard Shell</HI>; we &s;hould then be free, in another Element, and without Strife. <HI>Charity</HI> is the Prin|ciple of Union, <HI>Self-Love</HI> the Principle of Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>ALL this appears from the Nature of Things, and Experience of the World. Bate|ing a few Gentlemen who follow the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> every body complains of the Imperfections of Nature, which is indeed in a very poor State; and not only imperfect, but wretch|edly di&s;order'd. To take a view of Body and Soul, many things occur, that are very di&s;agreeable, and particularly with re&s;pect to the <HI>moral</HI> World, (&s;till more out of order than the natural;) and let any body judge what tho&s;e things are owing to. Our <HI>Self-Love</HI> not only makes us <HI>the Tyrants of o|thers,</HI> but al&s;o our own Executioners, and <HI>Self-Tormentors:</HI> whereas the divine Love, by making us lo&s;e &s;ight of our&s;elves, leads us both into Truth and Peace. It rectifies our corrupted Ta&s;te: 'Tis no longer in&s;uffi|cient mi&s;erable <HI>We,</HI> that are the Deities, but Honour is given where it is due. If we &s;ee any thing excellent in our Neighbour, we love it and him as Rays of the divine Excel|lency. If ever we turn an Eye to our&s;elves (and the &s;eldomer we do it with compla|cency, the better) we &s;hall con&s;ider our&s;elves, and every thing we have as deriv'd from that Source.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="315">
IF we ob&s;erve this Order, there can be no Error. We can hardly love our&s;elves too much, if we love our Neighbour as much; that is, if both the&s;e Loves center in a higher. And le&s;t People &s;hould deceive them&s;elves with a Fancy that they love God, when they do not, they ought to examine them|&s;elves, and &s;ee whether they love their Neigh|bours al&s;o: <HI>for he that loveth not his Neigh|bour, whom he hath &s;een; how can he love God, whom he hath not &s;een?</HI></P>

The Eruption of a burning Moun|tain is but like a Chimney on fire in a great City: And the Service of the Elements in general is a large Equivalent for the De&s;o|lations they &s;ometimes occa&s;ion, as the Plea&s;ure and Fertility of a River makes well up for what it carries away in a Stream. Not to mention the Beauty and Regularity of the Heavenly Bodies, with their bene|ficent Influences, (a Theme often and to good purpo&s;e in&s;i&s;ted on) which &s;ufficiently <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xix.</NOTE><HI>declare the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>SOME late Ridiculers of Providence, who do not &s;peak out, have occa&s;ion'd this little Digre&s;&s;ion, in acknowledgment of the infinite Power and Wi&s;dom that fram'd the World, and &s;till &s;upports it, in a &s;urprizing Lu&s;tre and Harmony. They would al&s;o have
<PB N="311" REF="319">
it believed that the World is without Virtue, as well as without a Governour; and argue from the common Practices of Men, of whom they reckon Chri&s;tians the wor&s;t, and take a handle from thence to di&s;parage Chri&s;tianity. But their Cavils again&s;t re|veal'd Religion &s;ignify nothing, who deny the natural; as theirs &s;ignify as little who a&s;cribe more to the natural than its due, and who are ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of a De&s;ign again&s;t all Religion, and as &s;ecret Abet|ters of Athei&s;m, by denying that Religion, which alone accounts for the pre&s;ent Di&s;or|ders of Men and Things.</P>
<P>WE are indeed in a mixt State, and a very tolerable one. As we are among Thorns and Briars, &s;o we are among Ro&s;es and Vio|lets: and our State here is ju&s;tly reckon'd a State of Tryal and Di&s;cipline. The Belief of a better Life afterwards, and if we add the Fall from Paradi&s;e, will make <HI>the pre&s;ent Afflictions light,</HI> and account pretty well for Affliction it&s;elf.</P>
<P>'TIS in the view of the afflicted, broken, un&s;atisfying State of things, that the Love of the World and the Creatures is &s;o much forbidden in Sacred Writ: Mankind being often addre&s;s'd with Arguments from their own Intere&s;t, as well as from the Point of Ju&s;tice. The <HI>natural</HI> Di&s;orders of the World

&s;eem to be the Con&s;equences of the <HI>moral.</HI> Our Lives are &s;hort, our Bodies weak and full of Di&s;ea&s;es, as if the Souls that inhabit them could not have a fitter Lodging: And from the&s;e <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>giddy</HI> Souls proceed more Sorrows than can be number'd. The Enquirers into the Origin of moral Evil will ever be at a lo&s;s to account for it. We &s;ee there is Pride, tho' we cannot tell how it fir&s;t enter'd; and all our Speculations labour under Difficulties. But we &s;ee that <HI>of Pride cometh Contention,</HI> and that it doth more mi&s;chief in the World than Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Luxury put together.</P>
<P>THE Love of the Creatures then is con|demn'd, becau&s;e they are <HI>frail</HI> and <HI>un&s;ati&s;|fying</HI> of them&s;elves; and by the Love of the World may be meant the Pa&s;&s;ion of follow|ing common Cu&s;tom, as well as that of gra|tifying our own Inclinations, &s;ome of which we mu&s;t often drop for fear of Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT the Love which is thus condemn'd, is more properly a Dotage: even the Love of rational Creatures may be &s;o, and the Love of Money and <HI>fine Things</HI> de&s;erves not &s;o good a Name as Dotage, but rather Avarice and Folly. The Love of rational Creatures is more excu&s;able on account of their Relation to us; and the natural Capa|city they have of delighting us, as any body will acknowledge, who has the lea&s;t Sen&s;e
<PB N="313" REF="321">
of Friend&s;hip, or even a Satisfaction in &s;ee|ing Faces and keeping Company. At the &s;ame time, rational Creatures are full of Im|perfections, and but like Apparitions for their Duration: &s;o that our Re&s;t is not to be in them. Nor, on the other hand, are their Imperfections &s;o to di&s;gu&s;t us, as to make us hate and de&s;pi&s;e them. The Command of loving our Neighbour imports a great deal, and is a divine thing, wherever we are not allured to it from our own Satisfaction; for in that ca&s;e it may be call'd <HI>natural Love</HI> (the Object making an agreeable Impre&s;&s;ion upon us) but not <HI>Self-Love</HI> or <HI>intere&s;ted Love,</HI> unle&s;s our own Intere&s;t were the only Spring of it. And 'tis &s;till to be remember'd, that the <HI>divine</HI> Principle does not extin|gui&s;h the <HI>natural,</HI> and that the Plea&s;ure re|&s;ulting from the Con&s;titution of things is not to be call'd <HI>Self-Love,</HI> nor the Effect of Selfi&s;hne&s;s, no more than it is &s;elfi&s;h to be pleas'd with the Light of the Sun. In fine, tho' we &s;hould neither &s;uppo&s;e a Fall nor a future State, the Arguments for <HI>Self-Love</HI> (by which all along has been meant the &s;el|fi&s;h Principle) can have no Foundation: for if we do any thing that can be call'd <HI>good</HI> with reference to others, it is only &s;o far <HI>good</HI> as we do it upon their account: And for this we may appeal to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who have not been corrupted with Books.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. The LOVE of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION being con&s;idered as our Duty to God, the highe&s;t part of this Duty is Love, which may be call'd the Mo|ther of all Duties. Particular Commands and Prohibitions &s;eem only to have been given for leading Man back to that Love, which was natural to him in his fir&s;t State.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid before, (Sect. vii.) that Love in general implies a De&s;ire after the Object, and a Delight in it. Now the Perfections of the divine Nature demon&s;trate the Love of God to be perfectly rea&s;onable, both in the Pur&s;uit and the Acquie&s;cence. And tho' Love is called <HI>blind,</HI> as in &s;ome re&s;pect it is really &s;o; yet the Under&s;tanding being <HI>enlighten'd, actuated,</HI> and <HI>influenced</HI> by the &s;ame unerring Spirit that influenceth the Heart, both the&s;e Powers are in perfect Or|der and Harmony; and their Operations con&s;equently mu&s;t be <HI>compleat, rational,</HI> and <HI>natural,</HI> every way <HI>right, &s;trong,</HI> and <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI>; nothing feeble, nothing fooli&s;h, nothing defective. The poor Expre&s;&s;ions of Men, are more defective than their Con|ceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="323">
BUT however imperfect either our Words or our Ideas may be, we can well enough perceive the Di&s;tinctions of things and their Properties. Nor does any Di&s;tinction &s;eem more nece&s;&s;ary to be kept in mind, than that of the Under&s;tanding and the Heart. By the former we di&s;cern the Beauty of an Ob|ject, and by the latter we love it or cleave to it: In agreeable Objects each of tho&s;e Faculties is pleas'd, but the Plea&s;ures are different. Again, our Under&s;tanding is the Seat of our Opinions, the Heart is the Seat of our Inclinations.</P>
<P>UPON the different Operations of the&s;e two Faculties, Dr. <HI>Henry More</HI> forms an Argument for the di&s;intere&s;ted or pure Love of God; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. IV.</NOTE>the Sub&s;tance of which is, <Q REND="inline">"That as Truth is the Object of the Intellect, and is a&s;&s;ented to becau&s;e it is true, without regard to the particular Under&s;tanding that contemplates it; &s;o Goodne&s;s is the Object of Love, which is lov'd chiefly for its own Excellency."</Q> And he concludes, <Q REND="inline">"We may as well affirm that there is no Under&s;tanding, but what is &s;elf-intere&s;ted, as that there is no Love but what is &s;elf-intere&s;ted."</Q></P>
<P>No body was ever found that deny'd to Mankind a Faculty of <HI>loving,</HI> as well as a
<PB N="316" REF="324">
Faculty of <HI>di&s;cerning:</HI> and one may be bold to &s;ay, that Love is &s;o much the Perfection and Happine&s;s of our Nature, that 'tis deplo|rable it were not directed to the proper Ob|jects, and attended with all the Conditions that render it worthy.</P>
<P>THE Heart is a Term both for the loving Faculty, and Love it&s;elf. <HI>Where your Trea|&s;ure is, there will your Heart be al&s;o:</HI> and <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord with all thine Heart.</HI> It is indeed added, <HI>and with all thy Might</HI>; to &s;hew that the Dignity of the Object requires that all our Faculties and their utmo&s;t Force &s;hould be employed in Love and Adoration. Again, an <HI>hone&s;t Heart</HI> is taken for a &s;incere Intention; and in &s;hort, the Heart is con&s;ider'd as the prin|cipal thing in Man. <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart.</HI></P>
<P>I have the rather mention'd this obvious Di&s;tinction of the Heart and the Under|&s;tanding, that &s;ome (and I believe very good Per&s;ons) have con&s;idered the Love of God only as an Act of the Under&s;tanding, by which the &s;upreme Being is adored for its Excellencies, and lov'd al&s;o; but chiefly loved, becau&s;e tho&s;e Excellencies are bene|ficial to us: and &s;uch Per&s;ons are &s;o much afraid of falling into <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> (meaning the Extravagance of a warm Imagination) that they exclude Love wholly from the
<PB N="317" REF="325">
Heart, le&s;t it &s;hould be call'd a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> or an indi&s;creet thing. But why may there not be divine Pa&s;&s;ions, as well as human? Spiritual Affections, as well as natural? The Imagination is by no means the Seat of Love, any more than it is the Seat of Hatred, Joy, or any other Affection of the Soul. How|ever, Imagination may impo&s;e upon us, or be impo&s;ed upon it&s;elf, this is but like &s;ee|ing thro' a fal&s;e Gla&s;s; the Operations of the Heart belonging to a quite different Pro|vince.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"THE true Love of God (&s;ays a late <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Free-Thinker. N^o. ccxvi.</NOTE>Writer) is calm, and &s;edate, and perma|nent. The crackling Blaze of Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;oon over; it dazles, and it &s;corches, for a moment; but leaves no la&s;ting Warmth: whereas the &s;ilent Glowings of the Heart are &s;trong, and durable; and pre&s;erve an equal Temper of Heat."</Q></P>
<P>THIS is very well expre&s;s'd. The Au|thor does not exclude the Love of God from the Heart; he rather &s;ays it ought to be there always, only in a <HI>calm &s;edate manner.</HI> But who can give Rules to Love? The State of the Heart, either as to its Sedatene&s;s or its Di&s;turbance, its Coolne&s;s or its Warmth, depends chiefly on the divine Power that acts upon it; and the &s;ame Per&s;on at diffe|rent times is under very different Operations;
<PB N="318" REF="326">
in Di&s;tre&s;s, in Joy, in Hopes, in Fears; as is evident from many Pa&s;&s;agges in &s;acred Writ.</P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t intention of falling into a Di&s;pute with this Author, for I know nothing at all about him, nor have &s;een any of his Papers but this &s;ingle one. I'm willing only to quote &s;ome of his Expre&s;&s;ions, as being among the be&s;t and the mode&s;te&s;t that are to be found in the Advocates for <HI>Self-Love,</HI> who often write both &s;aucily and confu&s;edly.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Whoever traces our Love of others, he will find, it ultimately termi|nates in <HI>our&s;elves</HI>; and that our Affection towards any Per&s;on is in reality a Retalia|tion of &s;ome kind Offices we either have received, or do (at lea&s;t) expect from him. It is true, we often have a tender Regard and a Value for tho&s;e who have been Benefactors to others, tho' they never extended their Kindne&s;s to us: But he who &s;earches deep into human Nature may ob&s;erve, that here likewi&s;e we give a &s;ecret Glance towards our&s;elves, and love the generous Per&s;on, not &s;o much be|cau&s;e he did good to another, as becau&s;e we imagine we al&s;o &s;hould have felt the &s;ame Effects of his Munificence, had he &s;een us in the like indigent Circum|&s;tances."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="327">
HERE the Charge again&s;t <HI>Self-Love</HI> is carried as high as nece&s;&s;ary, tho' the Author &s;eems to have de&s;ign'd it no di&s;paragement. The Search into human Nature can hardly be deep enough, &s;o very latent is the Bya&s;s towards our&s;elves. But the Retaliation of good Offices is by no means to be found fault with, Gratitude being a part of Ju&s;tice; and it can have no Tincture of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> when we expect no &s;uch Offices for the fu|ture. What &s;eems to be unnatural in the Account given of our Love of generous Per&s;ons, is the founding it on an Imagination, that we &s;hould have felt the &s;ame Effects of their Genero&s;ity; which is at mo&s;t but a po&s;teriour Reflection, and 'tis po&s;&s;ible the Fancy might never enter into one's head. And tho' the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>we love God be|cau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t,</HI> this is to &s;hew the Excellency of God's Love above ours; we having &s;uch Motives for loving him, where|as he had none for loving us.</P>
<P>THE Oppo&s;ition made to the pure Love of God, by Per&s;ons of Integrity and good Sen&s;e, has certainly ari&s;en from the Abu&s;e which has been made of that Doctrine by weak People, or vile Pretenders; the former really taking their own Fancies for the Ope|rations of the Almighty, and &s;o falling into &s;hameful Familiarity and nau&s;eous Expre&s;|&s;ions; and the latter &s;ort, having no Sen&s;e
<PB N="320" REF="328">
of Religion at all, have by their Pretences to the highe&s;t Things in it, impos'd upon the Society they liv'd in, and &s;ometimes &s;ubjected them to their Dominion and Ty|ranny: as in the ca&s;e of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> and others. Hence the Cry of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m, heated Imagination,</HI> and the like. Hence the Love of God is put in oppo&s;ition to all Affection, and confin'd to a &s;imple Acknow|ledgment of the divine Attributes, and (per|haps) a de&s;ire of keeping the divine Com|mandments, which may be more from a Regard to our&s;elves than the Deity. True Love leads naturally to the keeping of the Commands of God: and our Saviour only makes it the Te&s;t of Love, to undeceive any who may vainly think they love him without that inward Di&s;po&s;ition and outward Mark.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing that may have frighted People from the pure Love of God, is their imagining it mu&s;t cut off all natural and lawful Affections. But this Fear is ground|le&s;s: <HI>Husbands love your Wives,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle. Tho' God is to be loved with all our Heart, yet we may and ought to love &s;ome inferiour things, if we love them in the due Order and Mea&s;ure: even <HI>Self-Love</HI> may &s;tand, if it be turn'd down to its proper Station.</P>
<P>BUT as our Happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in the Love of our&s;elves, but in the Enjoyment
<PB N="321" REF="329">
of things &s;uited to our &s;everal Faculties; &s;o the &s;upreme Happine&s;s and Perfection of all intelligent Natures mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t only in the Love and Adoration of the eternal Good|ne&s;s. No words can expre&s;s the Perfec|tions of the Divine Nature, and Mortals when they &s;peak of it &s;hould be afraid of &s;peaking ab&s;urdly. <HI>The Heavens are not pure in his &s;ight, and he charges the An|gels with Folly.</HI> What is Man, wretched Man, that he &s;hould pre&s;ume to open his Mouth on &s;uch a Subject? But the Love of God is a known Expre&s;&s;ion, and a thing of all things the mo&s;t rea&s;onable; and yet un|fortunately di&s;puted!

'TIS true, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> lays it down with the Authority of a Lawgiver, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord with all thy Heart,</HI> &amp;c.

For without doubt the mo&s;t proper Object of our Love mu&s;t be, that which is in it&s;elf the mo&s;t perfect; that which, tho' we love ever &s;o much, we can never love up to its worth, having &s;till new and greater Cau&s;e to love it: and this can be nothing el&s;e but the alone uncreated, the infinite and eternal Beauty. <HI>Plato</HI>'s Method of A&s;cent from the Love of Beauty, which we &s;ee in the Body, to that which we &s;ee in the Soul, and from that to the immen&s;e Ocean of Beauty, is very re|markable.</P>

Now tho' it is diffi|cult to argue again&s;t Experience, or to talk People out of their Sen&s;es; yet it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome Minds of a certain Ca&s;t may at length imagine their own particular Nature to be of &s;uch Perfection, as to &s;tand in need of no Helps but what they have from within them|&s;elves; or, in other words, that their Rea|&s;on is a &s;ufficient Guide for all Purpo&s;es of Belief and Practice; and con&s;equently that they are not obliged to a&s;&s;ent to any thing but what they &s;ee clearly by this light: nay, that it were ab&s;urd even to be in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about it, but immediately to reject it; and that, as to Practice, their Inclinations being free from any wrong Bia&s;s or Tendency, there can be no better Guides than the&s;e nei|ther! From hence proceeds the Aver&s;ion to all Revelation, and to the Clergy or Prie&s;ts of all Religions, whom they look upon as too cunning for the re&s;t of Mankind, and &s;ometimes do them the honour to call them, <HI>the Compilers of the Sacred Records them&s;elves</HI>; not adverting to the Demon|&s;tration of the Facts, nor the Purity of the
<PB N="327" REF="335">
Doctrines, from which indeed the Lives of the Clergy as well as the Laity are very dif|ferent, to the hearty Regret of the &s;incere among all Ranks. And there is nothing but In&s;incerity (a hard Suppo&s;ition) or plain Delu&s;ion, that can account for &s;uch a &s;trange Repre&s;entation of the Excellency of human Nature, as to reject all Nece&s;&s;ity of a Medi|ator, Revelation, and the continual Influ|ences of the Divine Spirit on the impure fal|lible Spirits of Men, who are Blunderers in the commone&s;t Affairs. When one thinks of the Ignorance and Corruption of human Nature, one is almo&s;t in danger of falling in with the oppo&s;ite Party of Dei&s;ts, (and perhaps the Name is too good for either Party) who allow nothing at all to Man|kind that's good, not &s;o much as the lea&s;t Approbation of Virtue, nor any Virtue and Decency, but what the fanta&s;tical Humour of People happens to e&s;tabli&s;h. But 'tis hard to &s;ay which of the Extremes is wor&s;t: And &s;ome Per&s;ons have been very un&s;ucce&s;sful when they undertook to go the middle way, and would needs lay the Foundation of Re|ligion and all Duty upon <HI>Self-Love</HI>; the very thing, which Religion de&s;igns to extirpate; that is, the &s;elfi&s;h Principle in which a Man's Good is his highe&s;t Motive, or him&s;elf the Center of all his Aims. But to return.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;erters of the di&s;intere&s;ted Prin|ciple have this to &s;upport their Doctrine, that
<PB N="328" REF="336">
if one was to con&s;ider Love, as it is in the divine Nature, the fir&s;t Idea that would pro|bably occur, would be that of <HI>a free Com|munication of Good</HI>; as the Sun &s;ends forth its Light and its Heat.</P>
<P>THE Source of Joy and Bli&s;s can want nothing for him&s;elf: &s;o that the De&s;ign of making Creatures, is to impart Happine&s;s or Good to them. And 'tis very remarkable that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, <HI>God is Love, and God is Light</HI>; as if he had de&s;ign'd to ex|hibit the Deity to our imperfect Conception under the Characters of di&s;intere&s;ted Good|ne&s;s and diffu&s;ive Joy.</P>
<P>'TIS true, God is &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 4.</NOTE><HI>to have made every thing for him&s;elf:</HI> for every thing mu&s;t be made for &s;ome end by an intelli|gent Agent: and the Source of all Power, Wi&s;dom, and Beauty, and whatever is ex|cellent, mu&s;t be an End to it&s;elf; &s;ince there can be no End higher. Again, we hear of the arbitrary Plea&s;ure of God; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Revel. iv.</NOTE><HI>He hath created all things, and for his Plea&s;ure they are and were created.</HI> But the Idea of Goodne&s;s is in&s;eparable from that Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>SUCH is truely the inexpre&s;&s;ible Love of God, that he may be &s;aid to hire us to do
<PB N="329" REF="337">
good to our&s;elves. He has annexed Plea|&s;ure even to tho&s;e low things Eating and Drinking, as if we were to be bribed to &s;up|port our own poor Fabrick, as well as to <HI>re|pleni&s;h the Earth.</HI> Nor are the&s;e Plea&s;ures deny'd to the inferiour Creatures: Every thing living has its Enjoyments. So that tho' the common way of &s;peaking be true, <Q REND="inline">"God hath made every Creature for his own Glory, and all things here on Earth for the U&s;e of Man;"</Q> yet it is no le&s;s true, that he makes every Creature that has Life for its own good. And if we might &s;uppo&s;e greater and le&s;&s;er Motives in the in|comprehen&s;ible God, we would have rea&s;on to conclude that the good of Creatures is his greate&s;t Motive in creating them. He has no need of us, and we have need of every thing from Him.</P>
<P>WE are farther told, that Mankind &s;tands in a near Relation to the Deity: <HI>For we are his Offspring,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays from a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, which was the fitte&s;t Authority he could bring to tho&s;e he was arguing with; tho' it was a bold &s;troke enough in that Poet: but it is &s;upported by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>God made Man after his own Image</HI>; and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has enjoin'd us <HI>to be perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect</HI>; &s;hewing us at once our Relation and our Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="338">
THIS Relation (which we could not have &s;uppo&s;ed without the greate&s;t Arro|gance) makes the Duty the more apparent. We ought to imitate the Divine Nature, and <HI>be perfect</HI> as far as we are able. Now where can this Perfection lie in us, but in Di&s;intere&s;|tedne&s;s? 'Tis the only thing wherein we can imitate the Almighty, who (we are told a|gain) <HI>does good even to the wicked and un|thankful.</HI> Love mu&s;t be di&s;intere&s;ted, or in|tere&s;ted, or mixt: 'tis undi&s;putedly di&s;inte|re&s;ted towards our&s;elves, and is enjoin'd to be &s;o towards others, <HI>even the Wicked:</HI> how much more &s;o ought it to be towards the Fountain of all Good? This &s;eems to be plain Rea&s;oning, and no <HI>high Flight,</HI> as the pure Love of God has been unfortunately call'd by &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, and thence a handle given the Enemies of that Religion to di&s;parage it.</P>
<P>IF God then loves us di&s;intere&s;tedly, 'tis rea|&s;onable to think we ought to love him after the &s;ame manner: and if Love implies Union, that Condition of loving <HI>purely</HI> cannot be wanting; as it is only in Purity or Di&s;inte|re&s;tedne&s;s that we can find the Idea of Ju&s;|tice, by which every thing has its due, and is loved for its own Worth.</P>
<P>THE two Objections again&s;t the pure Love of God (for a third can hardly be imagin'd)
<PB N="331" REF="339">
are fir&s;t, that our Nature cannot attain to it; and &s;econdly, that it is not required of us. If the fir&s;t were true, the &s;econd would be &s;o of cour&s;e; for impo&s;&s;ible things wou'd not be required by the God of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. But it is plainly required in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, <HI>that we &s;hould love God with all our Heart</HI>; and by our Saviour in the <HI>New,</HI> who makes it <HI>the Sum of the Law and the Pro|phets.</HI> The annexing Promi&s;es and Threats, appears ea&s;ily a Conde&s;cen&s;ion to human Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>LET our Nature be call'd as weak and corrupt as any body has a mind, for 'tis cer|tainly in a very pitiful Condition; but let not the Capacity be denied of being <HI>tran&s;|form'd into a new Nature</HI> by the Power of God, or what is call'd <HI>Grace,</HI> as being out of the number of ordinary or moral Virtues, which mu&s;t be own'd to <HI>come from above</HI> al&s;o. 'Tis for Grace that Prayers are &s;o often put up by the Clergy of all Denominations, and the Love of God is pray'd for in expre&s;s terms. Properly Grace means Favour, and the Love of God to us is the highe&s;t Favour that can be vouch&s;af'd; as our Love to him is the greate&s;t Tribute we can offer, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t perfect State we can be in, and the happie&s;t for our&s;elves. By Grace is farther under&s;tood the Removal of tho&s;e Impediments and Ob&s;tructions which hinder the divine Influences from operating on the Hearts of Men; and &s;o the Prayer runs,
<PB N="332" REF="340">
<HI>Clean&s;e our Hearts by the In&s;pirations of thy holy Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. For the Divine Nature may be compared to the Sun, than which we have no vi&s;ible Object of more Force and Efficacy. And what can be more nece&s;&s;ary to be done away, than that &s;elfi&s;h Di&s;po&s;ition of Heart, which has no Rea&s;on either for its Love or Aver&s;ion, but the Appearance of Gain or Lo&s;s to it&s;elf?</P>
<P>THIS Article of the Love of God has been drawn out to a much greater length than was de&s;ign'd, and 'tis pity any thing &s;hould have been mixed with it that looks like Wrangling: But, as was before ob&s;erved, the Advocates for <HI>Self-Intere&s;t</HI> have rais'd it &s;o high, as to make it the only Principle of act|ing, not only among common Men, but the Apo&s;tles and Amba&s;&s;adors from Heaven. They have like wi&s;e perplex'd the Matter by &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>Self-Love</HI> for <HI>Self-Intere&s;t,</HI> and &s;o have render'd it an unfavourable thing to differ from them; &s;ince it is &s;o natural to love our&s;elves, and even to con&s;ult our Inte|re&s;t. But they are to under&s;tand, that there is no difference but in this &s;ingle Point, <Q REND="inline">"Whether God is to be lov'd <HI>principally</HI> for his &s;ake or our own."</Q></P>
<P>IT is not to be denied, that Rewards and Puni&s;hments are laid before us in the Scrip|ture, and that many of its Arguments are ac|commodated to Hope and Fear: But Religion
<PB N="333" REF="341">
de&s;igns al&s;o that our Hopes and Fears &s;hould have a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Foundation; in which ca&s;e they are of great &s;ervice to us, as the Spur and the Bridle, to animate our Dulne&s;s, or re&s;train our Forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Hope and Fear have their Place in Religion, they are not to have the highe&s;t Place. St. <HI>John</HI> hath a&s;&s;ured us, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv.</NOTE><HI>perfect Love ca&s;teth out Fear:</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath very deci&s;ively given Charity (that is, Love) the preference above all Gifts and Graces<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BOTH Hope and Fear may be con&s;idered either as divine Virtues, or natural Di&s;po&s;i|tions, Qualities, or what other Term the Reader &s;hall chu&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Objects of our Hope and Fear are Plea&s;ure and Pain in the general. And tho' Fear &s;erves as a Re&s;traint upon our Actions, yet it &s;erves al&s;o as an Inducement; the &s;hunning of Pain being often as &s;trong a Motive, as the procuring of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis chiefly with reference to Plea&s;ure and Pain in this Life, that our Hopes and Fears are awakened: &s;o that our pre&s;ent Quiet or Security as to the next Life is very much owing to our Stupidity. And the Pain that we are principally afraid of in
<PB N="334" REF="342">
this World, is the Cen&s;ure of others, who we cannot but &s;ee will take the &s;ame li|berty with our Character, that we take with theirs; and thus we pa&s;s our few Days in Dread and Slavery: this certainly will be own'd by the polite Part of Mankind, and there is hardly the meane&s;t Per&s;on but has his Fears and his Pride.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;hameful in the Fear of Cen&s;ure is the Exce&s;s of it, and when we are con|vinced our Judges are ignorant. What is &s;hameful in the Fear of Death, or bodily Pain, or Lo&s;s of Goods, is when we are too much di&s;concerted, and e&s;pecially when we are frightned out of our Virtue.</P>
<P>WHEN Hope and Fear are directed to the next World, they mu&s;t continue in &s;uch a Station (with every thing that God has planted) as <HI>perfect Love</HI> &s;hall a&s;&s;ign them. We are told it ca&s;teth out Fear, that is, any Apprehen&s;ion about our&s;elves; for by Fear is meant al&s;o Honour and Reverence, which can never be ca&s;t out: And this divine Hope is founded on a Sen&s;e of the infinite Good|ne&s;s, and not on <HI>Self-Love,</HI> for this were but Pre&s;umption. We may &s;ee nothing wor|thy of Love in our&s;elves, and yet have a great Confidence in the divine Mercy. And we are never fit Objects of that Mercy, 'till we lo&s;e our good Opinion of our&s;elves, and &s;ee our own In&s;ufficiency and Corruption. <HI>For God re&s;i&s;teth the Proud.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="343">
THE pure Love of God may be call'd an Element, which we can never breathe in till we get free of Self-Love: or, the&s;e two Loves having (as St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;ays) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N^o. VIII,</NOTE>made two Cities, a Man cannot at the &s;ame time be an Inhabitant of them both. But a very little Reflection may &s;hew us, which of the two Cities or Elements can afford us mo&s;t Plea&s;ure: for the highe&s;t Plea&s;ure is to love; and the highe&s;t Perfection is to love what is mo&s;t excellent.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Helps we can think of, to excite our Love to the Deity, whether it be the Con&s;ideration of his Goodne&s;s or his Power, Hopes or Fears, Gratitude, Pru|dence, or any thing that can occur to a rea|&s;onable Mind, &s;hould all be made u&s;e of in their order, and con&s;pire to lead us to that indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty; which tho' it be our in|&s;allible Intere&s;t, is yet to be pur&s;ued chiefly as our Duty: otherwi&s;e we have neither the true Notion of Love nor Ju&s;tice, nor even of our own Intere&s;t, but confu&s;edly jumble all three together, or perver&s;ely give Inte|re&s;t the preference, and &s;et up our&s;elves in the place of God, and con&s;equently fall into the Element of Trouble, or (at mo&s;t) into a delu&s;ive Quiet while it la&s;ts.</P>

<P>_SELF-LOVE is a compounded &s;ort of a Word, the Lover and the Beloved being one and the &s;ame, and the Object and the Faculty link'd together; as (in Dr. <HI>More</HI>'s Phra&s;e) <HI>Ginger-bread-Love, Money-Love,</HI> &amp;c.

only mean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader may &s;ee the Preface to a little Collection of Thoughts &s;ometimes join'd with the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI>'s, and the three fir&s;t Maxims them&s;elves, which &s;erve pretty well for &s;ettling the Ideas and Limits of Self-Love and Vir|tue.</NOTE> human Virtue, or &s;uch virtuous Actions as aim only at the Rewards of this Life; of which &s;ort of Virtue, <HI>Self</HI> is un|doubtedly the Foundation, and it mu&s;t be allowed to be a very un&s;table one.</P>
<P>THE Self-Love that's argued for by well|intention'd Per&s;ons, as the Foundation of all Duties both in Morality and Religion, is that Self-Affection which Nature has planted in us: But all manner of Affection, and the De&s;ire of all manner of Rewards mu&s;t be re|gulated by Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems fitte&s;t therefore to under&s;tand Self-Love (according to the mo&s;t current acceptation) as the Sink of all Vices, or as a bad Tree, which, if the Branches are lopt off upon one &s;ide, will put forth new ones upon another, &s;o long as <HI>the Ax is not laid to the Root.</HI></P>
<P>THE Argument again&s;t cutting down <HI>what God has planted,</HI> has no place in this Idea of Self-Love; for God plants nothing that's ill: And therefore nothing that he has planted is to be de&s;troyed in an ab&s;olute Sen&s;e; tho' &s;everal things are &s;o to peri&s;h, as to make way for what is more perfect. <HI>Meat</HI>

And thus Self Love, or law|ful Affection for our&s;elves, may be conceived as a thing not to be extingui&s;h'd, or lo&s;t in a Phy&s;ical Sen&s;e, but &s;wallow'd up by a &s;i|ner Principle, as a River is lo&s;t in the Sea.</P>

<P>IN the mere Sen&s;ation of Plea&s;ure there is neither Vice nor Virtue, Shame nor Prai&s;e; for we are but pa&s;&s;ive under the Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Love of Plea&s;ure and Self-Love are far from being convertible Terms. We love Plea&s;ure for our own &s;ake; and, if we are but pleas'd, we are indifferent what the Ob|ject be; and we readily quit one, from the view of more Plea&s;ure in another: and all this is rea&s;onable, provided we do not tran&s;|gre&s;s the Limits of Ju&s;tice.</P>

For, be&s;ides the Plea&s;ures of the five Sen&s;es, there are the Plea&s;ures of the Under&s;tanding, and the Plea&s;ures of the Heart, the Plea&s;ures of Spe|culation, and the Plea&s;ures of Practice; with an infinite Number of little Plea&s;ures depending on the animal Spirits, as Exer|ci&s;es, Diver&s;ions, Mirth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which are <HI>very good</HI> in their own order.</P>
<P>FALSE Plea&s;ures mu&s;t be allowed to have a certain Reality in them, &s;ince they actually do plea&s;e; but the Plea&s;ure is owing to a vitiated Ta&s;te: for in&s;tance, the Delight in hear|ing of other People's Defects, even when we have no de&s;ign to exalt our&s;elves.</P>

But it is enough to &s;uppo&s;e in general, that 'tis the Pro&s;pect of greater Intere&s;t that determines us to &s;uch Changes.</P>
<P>THE right Notion of Intere&s;t, and the Pur&s;uit of it, upon a deliberate Examination, is Prudence: for often Men are hurried on without any Con&s;ideration at all, and often they are very confu&s;ed in their Deliberations.</P>

<P>INIQUITY, tho' a negative &s;ort of term, implies a po&s;itive Breach of Ju&s;tice and Or|der: and &s;o long as the Mind is in the &s;el|fi&s;h Principle, it is in the State of Iniquity, even when it does not break out into Ac|tions.</P>

<P>IF Self-Love, in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e it can have, were the Principle of Religion, the greate&s;t Sin would be again&s;t our&s;elves.</P>

<P>RELIGION further requires the Ob&s;er|vance of other Practices, either &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;tituted by God, or appointed by tho&s;e to whom the Regulation of &s;uch things be|longs.</P>
<P>THE End of Religion is the &s;ame thing with the <HI>End of the Commandment,</HI> which is <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>ALL external Practices of Religion are de&s;ign'd for promoting that internal Di&s;po|&s;ition of Mind, both with re&s;pect to God and our Neighbour, and from it they de|rive all their Value. And this Religion is often called a &s;piritual and new Life.</P>
<P>THAT which is called <HI>the Religion of a Country,</HI> with re&s;pect to Forms, U&s;ages and Opinions, re&s;embles the <HI>municipal</HI> Laws of a Country, which are peculiar to it. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;o (Mr. <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> &s;ays) Orthodoxy on the one &s;ide of the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> may be Here&s;y on the other."</Q> Whereas among Chri|&s;tians there is properly but one Religion.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Religion therefore may be con&s;idered as a Body of Doctrine and Precepts delivered from Heaven, which Men ought to follow as the univer&s;al Stan|dard,
<PB N="354" REF="362">
and according to which they ought to form their particular Societies.</P>
<P>BUT there is this Difference between the Religion and the Laws of a Country, that a Man mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; but not always to the Religion: as an <HI>Engli&s;h|man</HI> may di&s;&s;ent &s;afely from the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN People talk of the Cruelties of Religion, Chri&s;tianity has nothing to an|&s;wer for in that Charge. And when the Clergy are accu&s;ed of Pride, the Accu&s;ation lies properly again&s;t the defective Nature of Men.</P>
<P>MOST Men allow there is a Di&s;tinction between the End of Religion, and the Means; they allow al&s;o a Di&s;tinction among the Means them&s;elves, as to Weight or Im|portance: But the <HI>mortal</HI> Di&s;pute remains, what the weightie&s;t are; and the End is often forgot in the Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THE End of Religion is therefore to be con&s;idered both as the Point to arrive at, and the principal Thing in the Affair.</P>
<P>SOME things may be called Parts of Re|ligion, as well as Helps to it; as Faith, Prayer, Temperance, and what&s;oever <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> has ordered to be done and believed.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="363">
PARTICULAR Forms of Religion, that is, &s;uch things as are but the Inventions of Men, may be called Helps to it, but not Parts; no more than the Clothes are Parts of the Body, tho' they are of indi&s;pen&s;able u&s;e to it. And in Religion the very Ob|&s;ervance of particular Modes comes to be a Duty, that, be&s;ides their U&s;efulne&s;s, there may be no offence given to the Society one adheres to. The Parallel between Religion and Clothes cannot be expected to run ex|actly.</P>
<P>'TIS with reference to religious Forms and Speculations, that Zeal (a good thing in it&s;elf) becomes both ridiculous and tra|gical.</P>

<HEAD>N^o. IX. ARRIAN, Lib. II. Cap. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Philo&s;opher (after <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI>) con&s;idering the Force that Profit, or what appears profitable, has over Mankind; and de&s;igning to recommend Virtue to their earne&s;t Pur&s;uit, labours to per&s;uade them that nothing is profitable but what is virtuous: he affirms, that it is only Wi&s;dom to love what is really good and u&s;eful; but that we have &s;uch a Bya&s;s to our|&s;elves, that if we &s;hall place Virtue and Utility on different &s;ides, we &s;hall of con&s;e|quence betake our&s;elves to the &s;ide we think profitable. So <HI>Arrian</HI> de&s;igns in this Chapter concerning Friend&s;hip to inform our Judgment as to our Duties, and to give us a view of our innate Selfi&s;hne&s;s. The whole Chapter &s;hould be read, and it will appear whether this good Heathen has been an Advocate for the intere&s;ted Principle or not.</P>
<P>'TIS true, he &s;ays <HI>no Creature is &s;o much reconcil'd to another, as to its own Profit</HI>; which no doubt is the Ca&s;e with Men in the common State of Nature: But tho&s;e who
<PB N="365" REF="373">
own Chri&s;tianity, as they are &s;till more per|&s;uaded of this Corruption, &s;o they &s;ee a greater difficulty of getting free of it, for the Heart is corrupted as well as the Under|&s;tanding is darkened; and it was to this lat|ter Faculty that the <HI>Stoicks</HI> chiefly applied them&s;elves, thinking if the Under&s;tanding was rightly inform'd, all the work was done.</P>
<P>BUT it does not infer, that they thought Intere&s;t the chief Principle that &s;hould de|termine Men, becau&s;e they pointed out where the true Intere&s;t lies; no more than the Scriptures can be brought to &s;upport that Principle, becau&s;e in teaching Men the way to Happine&s;s, they &s;ometimes make u&s;e of Arguments from Hope and Fear.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner, &s;ome great Men a|mong the Heathens have conde&s;cended to the Weakne&s;s of tho&s;e they were endea|vouring to in&s;truct. They knew that Vir|tue is not perfect, nor &s;uch at it ought to be, while Intere&s;t is the Motive; and they them&s;elves could be virtuous without regard to it: but they knew likewi&s;e the Di&s;orders of Human Nature, and that Profit was the chief Bait; and have therefore taken pains to &s;hew that Virtue and Profit are in&s;eparable. But if we would judge of the Purity of their Sentiments, it mu&s;t be from the Places where the Di&s;po&s;itions of their own Hearts are mark'd. The following Words of <HI>Epic|tetus</HI>

<P>THE Love of Truth (con&s;idered morally) is the &s;ame with the Love of Ju&s;tice. Thus the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Charity rejoiceth not in Iniquity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>ALL Truths are equal as to their Reality, but very unequal as to their Importance: and the Knowledge of the highe&s;t Truths, if it goes no farther than bare Speculation, is but Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ite things to Truth and Rea|lity are Fal&s;hood, Error, Lyes, Delu&s;ion; and the Mind takes plea&s;ure in the one &s;ide or the other, according to the Di&s;po&s;ition it is in.</P>

MAN'S Love of Truth, is an Argument of his Dignity.</P>
<P>HONOUR is properly a Regard for Truth. Fal&s;e Honour is a &s;ort of Contradiction, or at be&s;t 'tis but a Regard for Punctilio's. But even this common Honour of the World is a con&s;iderable Guard again&s;t &s;everal kinds of Pro&s;titution and Fal&s;hood.</P>

<P>WE &s;ee al&s;o a Choice made by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the former Chapter, <HI>rather to &s;uffer Afflic|tion with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a &s;ea&s;on.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a Difference in the Plea&s;ures &s;et before <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and JESUS CHRIST: it was but the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Egypt</HI> that were propo&s;ed to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the&s;e he rejected.

<PB N="372" REF="380">
and we are only told <HI>he had an Eye</HI> to it, as the Reward of his Choice.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that JESUS CHRIST is not included by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in that <HI>Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> as being in a &s;uperior order.

<P>I need not run thro' all the Parallel be|tween our Saviour and <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> it will ea&s;ily appear wherein it agrees and wherein it dif|fers, as all Compari&s;ons do differ in &s;ome|thing.

Inferior Motives may certainly con&s;i&s;t with &s;uperior ones, and the former may &s;ometimes give way, as they always ought to do when Order requires it.

to the Faculty it&s;elf. Rea&s;on is &s;ure within its own Sphere, but is bewilder'd and lo&s;t when it pretends to go father: And Self-Love is lawful within due Allowances, but unlawful when it violates Order.</P>

But I have told all my De&s;ign in the Introduc|tion. . . . . .</P>
<P>THO' the Enemies of Chri&s;tianity have taken advantage of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of the Clergy in favour of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> and the Sufficiency of Rea&s;on; yet neither of the&s;e Doctrines is e&s;pous'd by any Party in the gro&s;s, but rather rejected by the greate&s;t number of all Parties; Papi&s;ts, Prote&s;tants, and all the Branches of the&s;e la&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"Be on your guard (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Evans</HI>) again&s;t Selfi&s;hne&s;s, or &s;uch an Addictedne&s;s to
<PB N="378" REF="386">
your&s;elves, as &s;hall confine your Regards within the narrow Circle of Self. Such a <HI>Self-Love</HI> is the main Principle of all the Evils and Di&s;orders in the World; it makes Men undutiful to God, and u&s;ele&s;s if not pernicious to tho&s;e about them."</Q> And how finely has Mr. <HI>Butler</HI> of the Rolls Chapel expre&s;s'd him&s;elf again&s;t <HI>Self-Love</HI> in his Sermons! <HI>Evans</HI> &s;ays al&s;o of the Love of God, <Q REND="inline">"That it is indeed <HI>the fir&s;t and great Commandment:</HI> it is fir&s;t in order of Nature, and in the Preeminence of the Object to which it relates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>AMONG the Writers of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> the Expre&s;&s;ions are no le&s;s remarkable both again&s;t <HI>Self-Love,</HI> and for the pure Love of God. Citations might be produc'd in great plenty from Writers in all Ages. Tho&s;e who wrote the earlie&s;t, gave their Te&s;|timony to <HI>pure Love,</HI> and no doubt had in|&s;i&s;ted more upon it, but that the Doctrine of <HI>Self-Love</HI> had not then &s;et up its Horns. The&s;e Words of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another Rea&s;on why good Men are afflicted with temporal Evils, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Job,</HI> that the Mind may be put to a Tryal, and di&s;cover the Force of its own Piety, or how much it loves God for nothing.</NOTE>St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> can hardly be forgot, <Q REND="inline">"Habent aliam cau&s;am boniquare temporalibus affligantur malis, qualem habuit <HI>Job:</HI> ut &s;ibi-ip&s;i humanus animus &s;it probatus &amp; cognitus, quanta virtute pietatis <HI>gratis</HI> Deum diligat."</Q> As to <HI>Job,</HI> a Que&s;tion was indeed put by the Devil,
<PB N="379" REF="387">
<HI>Does</HI> Job <HI>&s;erve God for nought?</HI> But the following part of the Hi&s;tory &s;ufficiently &s;hew'd <HI>Job</HI>'s Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as well as his Patience.</P>
<P>. . . . No body can deny that the Scrip|ture in&s;i&s;ts upon Rewards and Puni&s;hments, as Arguments drawn from our own Intere&s;t: but Intere&s;t ought not to ju&s;tle out Duty, Ju&s;tice, and Order; nor even to be preferr'd to the&s;e. <HI>Henry More</HI> had rea&s;on to men|tion that Maxim of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> odd as it looks, <HI>propter quod unumquodque e&s;t tale,</HI> &amp;c. for 'tis certain, that whatever is regarded chiefly for the &s;ake of another thing, is the lea&s;t re|garded of the two. But 'tis carefully to be remember'd, that the Scripture is accommo|dated to the State of Mortals, and &s;peaks to the <HI>&s;tronger</HI> and the <HI>weaker,</HI> to tho&s;e of better Di&s;po&s;itions, and tho&s;e of wor&s;e; yet <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays to all, <HI>Be ye perfect,</HI> &amp;c. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther, that the Promi&s;es annex'd to our Duty are not given barely as an Incitement to it, but al&s;o to &s;hew the Di&s;po&s;itions we mu&s;t be in, before we can attain to the Happine&s;s de&s;ign'd for us; as for in&s;tance, before we can <HI>&s;ee God</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>pure in Heart.</HI></P>
<P>A modern Logician, Mon&s;. <HI>Crou&s;az,</HI> &s;ays very well upon the different Di&s;po&s;itions of People with re&s;pect to Virtue; 'tis to this purpo&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"The bare Knowledge of Virtue
<PB N="380" REF="388">
determines one Per&s;on to cleave to it; another needs the Maje&s;ty of a Lawgiver to be added; a third has need of Pro|mi&s;es; a fourth of Threats; and a fifth of Blows."</Q> Here is a Gradation of Virtue from the highe&s;t Form to the lowe&s;t: the lowe&s;t is very low, and the highe&s;t as high as Dr. <HI>More</HI> or the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> wou'd demand. If Mon&s;. <HI>Crou&s;az</HI> &s;peaks &s;ome|times favourably of <HI>Self-Love</HI> (I mean the intere&s;ted Principle) the like has happen'd to very good Per&s;ons, even among the Clergy . . . . . . . which led me into that Critici&s;m (N^o. XI.) and I'm not yet &s;ure if it &s;hould &s;tand: But it was owing to a Sermon of Bi|&s;hop <HI>Bull,</HI> which every body may &s;ee in print. 'Tis unea&s;y to differ from a learned and good Man. But what &s;hall one do when a greater number of learned and good Men are on the other &s;ide of the Que&s;tion? Here is another Bi&s;hop of the &s;ame Church, Bi&s;hop <HI>Lake,</HI> he &s;ays in his Sermon on <HI>Math.</HI> xxii. 27. <Q REND="inline">"If there be any thing that may be lov'd jointly with God, it mu&s;t not &s;hare equally with God, but keep its di&s;|tance, and receive our Love by a Reflec|tion from God. . . . . . Thus if we love God. . . . . . . . . we love him above all things, and we love him for him&s;elf; for <HI>that</HI> mu&s;t needs follow, when we love him for no other thing, no not for our own &s;elves, but are willing to hazard all, even our&s;elves and all, for the Love of
<PB N="381" REF="389">
him."</Q> How far is Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s car|ry'd in that Prayer of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Give me, O Lord, a lively Faith, a firm Hope, and a lively Charity; a Love of Thee incomparably above the Love of my&s;elf, that I may love nothing to thy Di&s;plea&s;ure, but every thing in order to thy Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Give me, O Lord, a Longing to be with Thee, not for avoiding the Calamities of this wretched World, nor &s;o much for e&s;caping the Pains of Purgatory, or tho&s;e of Hell, nor for attaining the Joys of Heaven with re&s;pect to my own Advan|tage, as purely for the Love of Thee.</P></NOTE>Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s! . . . . . . I have often wonder'd how this Prin|ciple &s;hould give &s;uch Alarm, as if the Quiet of the World was <HI>in danger</HI> from it. In the fir&s;t place, it is not likely to be much practi&s;ed, and then it can never be &s;o inter|preted, as if People were forbid to take due care of them&s;elves; for if a Man did not &s;o, he would be ill taken care of, as the World is. But in dealing with the World and Almighty God, the Rules are widely different: with him there is no u&s;e for Caution and Re&s;erve, but the more unlimited the Tru&s;t and De|pendance, &s;o much the greater the Safety and Happine&s;s. How agreeable is it to re|flect on the Con&s;titution of Things, and to find Happine&s;s re&s;ult from the Ob&s;ervance of Order and Duty!</P>
<P>How Di&s;order fir&s;t enter'd into the World, is like to remain a Secret to Mankind, and it &s;eems to be of little u&s;e to go into Meta|phy&s;ical Inquiries about it; &s;ince whatever way the Que&s;tion were re&s;olved, it would make no alteration either in our Duty, or in the Nature of Things: Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s
<PB N="382" REF="390">
will always be our Dury, and our Duty will always be our Intere&s;t. But the Ideas of the&s;e two are different, however they may coincide in the Event; and in all Duties the Value will ever be mea&s;ur'd by the Mo|tive.</P>
<P>IN this Point even Chri&s;tians and Dei&s;ts &s;eem to be agreed, for Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s is a common Principle between them. And when any Chri&s;tians &s;et up for Intere&s;tedne&s;s, the Dei&s;ts make a handle of it to di&s;parage Chri&s;tianity: Again, when Chri&s;tians &s;et up for the Sufficiency of Rea&s;on, the Dei&s;ts are fond of their Expre&s;&s;ions, and quote them to prove Chri&s;tianity an u&s;ele&s;s thing. . . . . . One great Difference between Chri&s;tianity and Dei&s;m is this, Chri&s;tianity repre&s;ents human Nature in a &s;tate of Di&s;order, the Under&s;tanding limited and confus'd, the Pa&s;&s;ions tumultuous, and the Heart cor|rupted; and con&s;equently a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;u|perior A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Dei&s;m gives a quite dif|ferent Repre&s;entation, as if every thing in Man was intire, and nothing &s;o ea&s;y as the balancing of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and all the re&s;t. The difference between Chri&s;tianity and Dei&s;m in the point of Self-Denial follows of cour&s;e: Chri&s;tians at lea&s;t profe&s;s it. And if the Dei&s;ts alledge they are not in earne&s;t, and believe le&s;s than they pretend to; it can never come to a Demon&s;tration, and the Chri&s;tians may alledge, that the Dei&s;ts be|lieve
<PB N="383" REF="391">
more than they own, the external and rational Evidences for Chri&s;tianity being &s;o &s;trong. . . . . . . . Nor is Chri&s;tianity a Doc|trine of Vexation and Sorrow: it only &s;ets things before us as they are; that we may not be deceiv'd with fal&s;e Appearances. What Situation of Fortune can be &s;ufficient to tran&s;port any Per&s;on, that reflects on the Pre&s;ent State of the World, and the Variety of Evils, both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral?</HI> . . . . . . . . The World is <HI>felt</HI> to be what it is. Phi|lo&s;ophy is for the mo&s;t part but Grimace.</P>
<P>BUT it is not &s;o much the In&s;ufficiency of things, as the Inju&s;tice of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> that I had a mind to repre&s;ent; that Principle by which a Man would make him&s;elf the Cen|ter of the Univer&s;e! And I hope it will not be reckon'd too pre&s;umptuous, if I endeavour this once to &s;tate the Que&s;tion concerning <HI>Self-Love</HI> and the Love of God in &s;uch a way, that all Chri&s;tians may (if po&s;&s;ible) agree in it.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion here is not whether we are to love God, or whether it be our Intere&s;t to love him, or whether it be the Will and the Glory of God, that he &s;hould be lov'd by all intelligent Creatures, (for in the&s;e things all Chri&s;tians are agreed;) but the Que&s;tion is, whether we are to love him from the Motive of his Perfection, or from that of our own Indigence; whether we are to
<PB N="384" REF="392">
love him for the &s;ake of our own per&s;onal Advantage. bee u&s;e we cannot be happy without him, or becau&s;e he is indeed the mo&s;t amiable Object, without con&s;idering our own Advantage whether we are to love him, becau&s;e it is ju&s;t and right in it&s;elf, or becau&s;e our own Hopes and Fears deter|mine us? If it be &s;aid, we ought to love him both becau&s;e it is ju&s;t in it&s;elf, and al&s;o becau&s;e it is our Intere&s;t; it may be an&s;wer'd, that as the&s;e Motives are not to be equal, (other|wi&s;e we &s;hould love God and our&s;elves equally) the Que&s;tion comes to be, whether Intere&s;t &s;hall give place to Ju&s;tice, or Ju&s;|tice give place to Intere&s;t? For however both the&s;e Motives may &s;ub&s;i&s;t together at fir&s;t, yet the le&s;&s;er Motive will and ought to be &s;wallow'd up by the greater. Now if we will but con&s;ider as carefully the Ju&s;tice there is in loving God, as the particular Profit that &s;hall accrue to us by it, we &s;hall at la&s;t be &s;o penetrated with the Sen&s;e of the Ju&s;tice of the thing, as to reflect no more on our Profit; or if we do, we &s;hall find that tho' Profit accompanies our Love, yet it is no longer worthy to be the Motive of it; and that as the lea&s;t By-view to Intere&s;t renders Love le&s;s perfect, &s;o it is only that Love, which is without any &s;uch View, that is ab&s;olutely pure and perfect: becau&s;e in that Love, the Lover, forgetting him&s;elf, wholly rejoices only in the Beloved. And this (however &s;ome have call'd it a Refine|ment)
<PB N="385" REF="393">
is no more than what the Nature of the thing requires, and what <HI>Cicero</HI> has even required in Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if we &s;till love our&s;elves with a di&s;tinct Love, independent on that of God, how &s;hall we ever get &s;o far out of the &s;elfi&s;h State, as <HI>to love God with all our Heart and all our Strength?</HI> And yet this great Duty is acknowledged by all Chri&s;tians, and the Practice of it in the full and literal Meaning of the Words is the highe&s;t Per|fection: for <HI>the End of the Commandment is Charity, and Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</HI> Whatever inferiour Motives there|fore our Imperfections, may &s;tand in need of in the beginning, yet they mu&s;t at la&s;t give way to a more perfect Principle: &s;o that if any &s;hall take upon them to condemn the pure di&s;intere&s;ted Love of God, I &s;ee not how they can reconcile this with their own Acknowledgement, that He is to be loved with all our Heart.</P>
