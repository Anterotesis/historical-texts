<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE good Town of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> now boa&s;ts the Honour of <HI>my Birth,</HI> as it for|merly did that of the great Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>I was conceived in <HI>Sin</HI> and brought forth in <HI>Iniquity, Anno</HI> 1680, &s;o that I am double the Age of my Cou&s;in <HI>Stephen Duck,</HI> and have therefore, you may rationally &s;up|po&s;e, <HI>Ploughed, Harrowed,</HI> and <HI>Thre&s;hed,</HI>
<PB REF="6">
twice as long, and all to no Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s the good Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> will likewi&s;e read &s;ome of my <HI>Parna&s;&s;ian</HI>-Labours to our mo&s;t Gracious Queen; but, I live in hopes that his Lord&s;hip will grant me this humble Boon, and that my Kin&s;man and I, may &s;hare one equal Fate.</P>
<P>As to my Education, the mo&s;t learned Dr. <HI>Arthur Duck,</HI> being my Godfather, I was by his Intere&s;t got upon the Foundation of <HI>Eton</HI>-College, and having gone through my School-Studies, I was, as well as my Country|man <HI>Thomas Tu&s;&s;er,</HI> for &s;ometime a Student in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> In this &s;eminary of the Mu&s;es, our <HI>Alma-Mater</HI> being peevi&s;h, fretful, and generally out of Humour, I could not &s;o much as Rhime my &s;elf into a College-Fellow&s;hip. This I took, as <HI>Hudibras</HI> &s;ays, in great <HI>Dudgeon,</HI> more e&s;pecially, &s;ince it is well known that the whole <HI>Race of the DUCKS were born Poets.</HI></P>
<P>I left <HI>King's</HI>-College, and came to a&s;&s;i&s;t my Parents in their Farming-Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI>; where I &s;oon found that <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Hops</HI> came to a much better Market than <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>La|tin.</HI>
<PB REF="7">
Tho' in this fir&s;t Part of my Ru&s;tic-Mi&s;cellany,<Q><L>I hope th' impartial Reader will di&s;cern,</L>
<L>I ne'er invok'd the Mu&s;es in a Barn.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the Death of my inte&s;tate Parents, being an only Child, there fell to me, by right of Inheritance, a very decent Country-Legacy, <HI>viz.</HI> Good &s;tore of Grain, the Pa&s;tures well &s;tockt with Cattle, Provender for their Win|ter-Su&s;tenance, and a round &s;um of Money. But, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays,<Q><L>My Way-ward, wandring Mind did not approve,</L>
<L>My happy State; I was inclin'd to rove:</L></Q></P>
<P>And &s;oon experienced the fatal Con&s;equences attending &s;uch a Temper. In &s;hort, I had no Notion of foreign Travel; nothing would &s;erve me, but making the Tour of <HI>Change-Alley</HI>; where, in that memorable Year of Chronology 1720, I fell a Victim on the Altar which made a daily Sacrifice both of <HI>Cit</HI> and <HI>Bumpkin.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having &s;unk the <HI>Scholar</HI> in the <HI>Farmer</HI>; and the <HI>Farmer</HI> having undergone a <HI>South-Sea</HI>
<PB REF="8">
Ship wreck; I am now reduced to my Kin&s;|man's Pri&s;tine Vocation of <HI>God &s;peed the Plough.</HI></P>
<P>My Wages, are indeed, five Shillings and Six-pence <HI>per</HI> Week, our County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> giving one Shilling more than they do in <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI>; tho' alas, at this Price, it is with great Difficulty that <HI>Buckle</HI> and <HI>Throng,</HI> as we &s;ay, are brought together. However, I am in hopes of &s;eeing better Days,<Q>Redeunt <HI>Saturnia</HI> Regna.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, in one Word, my &s;ole Tru&s;t is in my noble Patron, therefore<Q><L>Whate'er thro' <HI>Carolina</HI>'s Hand is &s;ent,</L>
<L>I'll prai&s;e Earl <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> and be Content.</L></Q></P>
