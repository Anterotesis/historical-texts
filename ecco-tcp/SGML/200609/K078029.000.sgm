<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
UPON THE
Trade to <HI>Africa, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is, no Que&s;tion, the harde&s;t Thing
in the World, to Convince Men's
Judgments again&s;t their Intere&s;t, and
per&s;uade Men to Believe, what they
de&s;ire &s;hould not be true.</P>
<P>This I conceive has been one Cau&s;e, why
the <HI>African</HI> Company and the Separate Tra|ders
have Argued &s;o long again&s;t one ano|ther
to &s;o little purpo&s;e; till at la&s;t, they
&s;eem to give over Di&s;puting for Conviction
of one antoher, and labour to po&s;&s;e&s;s other
Men, with the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of their re|&s;pective
Preten&s;ions; that the World being
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Judges of their Arguments, they that have
the Strength of Rea&s;on on their Side may
have mo&s;t Voices, and make their Cau&s;e
mo&s;t Popular.</P>
<P>But in this they have not been without
their Difficulties, and the Ground they
have gotten on either Side, &s;eems hardly
worth the Noi&s;e it has made: This
&s;eems owing Principally to the back|wardne&s;s
of People's making them&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of the Cau&s;e, either on one Side
or other, and perhaps a little to the unhappy
Cu&s;tom of the Age, <HI>viz.</HI> Of appearing for
or again&s;t, as Parties, Prejudices, Friend|&s;hips,
Examples, or Intere&s;ts Guide us, ra|ther
than by the true Method of Enquiring
into the Bottom of Things, and Impartial|ly
Judging, according to the Weight of their
proper Merit.</P>
<P>We chu&s;e to lay the Blame however, up|on
the fir&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Peoples Ignorance
in the Cau&s;e, and hope the Time may
come again, when Men of Sen&s;e &s;hall judge
Things as they are, rather than as Men of
Art would make them &s;eem to be: In
hopes of this, and to &s;horten this Di&s;pute if
po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e few Thoughts are put into
Print, that Unbya&s;s'd Men may &s;ee by a
clear Light, and make a Judgment of Truth
upon the Matter,</P>
<P>In order to this, we &s;hall briefly, and with
all po&s;&s;ible plainne&s;s, enter a little into the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Merits of the Cau&s;e, and &s;earch to the
Bottom the Tran&s;action it &s;elf, between
the Company and the Separate Traders:
We &s;hall enquire into their Management
of the Trade, as it re&s;pects them&s;elves,
the Trade it&s;elf, and the Nation: Their
Behaviour to one another, how, and up|on
what Foundation they have begun
the pre&s;ent War between them; how
they become, as no doubt they now are,
Incon&s;i&s;tent with one another; and how
their pre&s;ent contending Circum&s;tances are
Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Trade it &s;elf, and with
the Publick Good of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Original of the Company is known,
and needs take up none of our Time, only
it may a little concern the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute,
to make this one Remark, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
came in by Purcha&s;e, a Ju&s;t, Lawful, and
Honourable Way; the Circum&s;tances of
the former Company declining, and they
being in no Condition to carry on the Trade;
and the Trade it&s;elf appearing then in its
Infancy, to be a mo&s;t Profitable, U&s;eful, and
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Branch of our Com|merce;
for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the Government
concern'd it&s;elf, as no doubt all wi&s;e Govern|ments
will, that &s;o great an Advantage
&s;hould not be lo&s;t to the Nation.</P>
<P>This they did by Encouraging a new Sub|&s;cription,
to which his late Maje&s;ty K. <HI>Cha.</HI> II.
and his Royal Brother then D. of <HI>York,</HI> after|wards
<PB N="6" REF="5">
King of <HI>England,</HI> gave particular En|couragement,
Sub&s;crib'd a con&s;iderable
Stock, was pleas'd to grant a Royal Char|ter,
Dated <HI>Anno</HI> 1672. from whence they
derive the Title of the <HI>Royal African Compa|ny;</HI>
this is not repeated in Compliment
to the Company, but for the &s;ake of the o|ther
part of the Story.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Authority of their
New Foundation, and the Favour of their
Prince, which they had then to &s;o great a
degree as above; yet &s;uch was the Re&s;pect
had to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Africa,</HI> by Forts and Ca&s;tles, and the
Settlement of Factories, for the Manage|ment
and Security of the Trade; &s;o evi|dently
did it appear, that without the&s;e
Forts, Ca&s;tles, and Settlements, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to carry on the Trade, or to pre|&s;erve
and enlarge it; that this New Com|pany
were oblig'd to take off the&s;e Forts
and Ca&s;tles, from the Hands of the Compa|ny
that went before them.</P>
<P>As the Nece&s;&s;ity for having the&s;e Forts
and Ca&s;tles for carrying on the War, pre|vail'd,
&s;o the Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice to the Old
Company prevail'd; and tho' they were
not able to carry on the Trade, yet no
Thoughts were Entertain'd of taking away
their Property, without a valuable Con&s;i|deration;
&s;uch a Barbarous Thought ne|ver
entred into the Coun&s;els of tho&s;e ju&s;ter
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
Nor were the Old Company in all their
mo&s;t de&s;picable Circum&s;tances, oblig'd to
part with them as Heaps of Materials, and
old Stuff for Building; the Price was not
run down as of old Hou&s;es, to be Demo|moli&s;h'd
and good for little, tho' they
were at that Time really in but a mean
Condition, of &s;mall Strength, and no way
proportionable to what they are now, or
what the Security of the Trade call'd for.</P>
<P>But they were con&s;ider'd at a moderate
rea&s;onable Value between both, as Things
nece&s;&s;ary to the New Company, and
that had been very chargeable to the
Old; u&s;eful for the Security of the Com|merce,
and e&s;&s;ential to the very Being and
Nature of the Thing: Thus the New Com|pany
came in upon a very fair Purcha&s;e,
and gave at fir&s;t, in the very Infancy of the
Trade 34000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, for but one of
tho&s;e very Forts and Ca&s;tles which are
&s;ince that made the Subject of &s;ome Peoples
Je&s;t; and which <HI>fir&s;t</HI> they would have be
thought of no U&s;e to the Trade; but when
that was not to be made out, then they
would have it, that the Number was too
great, and the Value of them but a Trifle.</P>
<P>This is the more needful to be ob&s;er|ved
here, to give all Men leave to take
Notice of the remarkable Ju&s;tice of the
pre&s;ent Separate Traders who oppo&s;e the
Company; who would not only have the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Company's Forts and Ca&s;tles vallued at lit|tle
or nothing, but would not have that
little paid them neither, but would have
them taken from them; either by dive|&s;ting
the Company of their Property upon
a pretended A&s;&s;ignment for Payment of
Debts, or which is equally ju&s;t, would
have them put into the Hands of the
Government, without making any Satis|faction
to the pre&s;ent Company for them,
which is little better than endeavouring
to get an Act to make a General Plunder
of the Company's Effects.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but when they pro|po&s;ed
that the Government &s;hould have
the Forts and Ca&s;tles, their Juftice to the
Government was as Eminent as their Ju&s;tice
to the Company, for they were not to
make any Settled Payment to the Govern|ment,
for the Expence of Maintaining the
Garri&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Forts, except a
Certain Rate <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon an uncertain
Degree of Trade; for no Man was to
Export more than he plea&s;ed, or to pay
for more than he Exported. The&s;e are
Speciments of the Ju&s;tice of the Treat|ment
both the Company and the Govern|ment
were to meet with with from the&s;e
Gentlemen.</P>
<P>But to return to the Ca&s;e in Hand. The
Company having obtain'd a Charter from
the Crown, and their Trade &s;ecur'd with
<PB N="9" REF="8">
exclu&s;ive Privileges, &s;uited to its Pre&s;erva|tion
at Home, and with Forts, Ca&s;tles,
and Settlements, for its Defence Abroad,
went on pro&s;perou&s;ly for many Years.</P>
<P>If any Per&s;ons yet remain'd doubt|ful
of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Advantage of
this Trade, or of the Magnitude it ro&s;e to
under the Protection of the &s;everal Princes
afore&s;aid, it might not be ami&s;s to enlarge
here, by telling them, What in the Space of
Twenty Years, or thereabout, they Ex|ported
in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures; How many
Negroes, they &s;ent to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies
in the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> and how many Thou&s;and,
Ounces of Gold they brought into <HI>England,</HI>
be&s;ide the Export of Foreign Goods by De|bentures,
and the Import of many Thou&s;and
Pounds <HI>Sterl.</HI> in Wax, Elephants Teeth, Drugs
and valuable Commodities, the Growth of
the Country there, and nece&s;&s;ary to ours
here.</P>
<P>We might tell you how, had this Trade
been neglected and left langui&s;hing, as it
has been &s;ince, under the Depredations of
Interlopers and Separate Traders, the Ha|zards
of the War, and Lo&s;&s;es at Sea; had
they been worryed, and kept in con&s;tant
Alarm by the Attacks and Barking of their
Rivals in the Trade, not a third Part of the
Poor had been employ'd, whom their Trade
kept Alive; not a third Part of the Negroes
had been carryed to <HI>America,</HI> tho' at double
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Price; and not a Tenth Part of the Gold
had been brought in to help our declining
Ca&s;h to circulate, in a Time when a long
War had &s;topt the Channels of Bullion from
<HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e Things need not to be enlarg'd
on, they come within every Man's Reach;
and the mo&s;t ignorant in Trade know them.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the Pro&s;perity of the
Company was &s;uch, that they had very
little Debt upon them, an unlimited Cre|dit,
a full Ca&s;h, a va&s;t Stock, and their
Actions run the highe&s;t upon a real Bot|tom
to &s;upport them, of any Company that
ever was in <HI>England;</HI> being once Sold at Four
Hundred Pound <HI>per Cent.</HI> being the &s;ame
Thing that has &s;ince been Sold for Ten
Pounds, or very little more.</P>
<P>This Remark is Needful to let the World
&s;ee, that the Great Debt upon the Com|pany,
which the Separate Traders make
u&s;e of as an Argument, why they &s;hould
be given up, is meerly occa&s;ion'd by the
Convul&s;ions of their Trade, from the In|va&s;ions
of tho&s;e very People that Com|plain;
for that before there were any In|telopers,
or that they went on with Impu|nity,
the Company had no need to run
into Debt.</P>
<P>It is true, That during the Reign of
tho&s;e very Princes, the ju&s;t Protectors of
this Trade, &s;ome Attempts were made by
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Interlopers and clande&s;tine Traders, to
break in upon their Trade: And the Com|pany
&s;uffer'd always by tho&s;e Attempts, of
which large Accounts have already been
given by the Company in Print; but
their Right being clear, and that Right be|ing
always &s;upported by the Publick Good,
and the Ju&s;tice of the Government, the
Company were enabled to do them&s;elves
Ju&s;tice upon the &s;aid Interlopers; and they
met with &s;uch frequent Di&s;couragements,
by the Legal Pro&s;ecutions of the Company
in Defence of Right, that the Interloping
Trade gain'd but little Ground of them
for many Years.</P>
<P>It was very hard, that when the Revo|lution
happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which was
e&s;teem'd a general Deliverance of the Na|tion
from Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice, and
Men rejoyc'd every where for the more
free and Legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Rights
and Properties, that the <HI>African</HI> Company
&s;hould be the Only Sufferer; the only Peo|ple
that were left in a wor&s;e Condition than
before; the only People that &s;eem'd to have
le&s;s Security for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Pro|perties,
and to feel more Oppre&s;&s;ion than
they did before; and that they, of all the
Nation, &s;hould have the true Cau&s;e of Re|joycing
at that Great Affair taken from 'em.</P>
<P>But then it was, that from the Revoluti|on
to the Year 1700, or thereabouts, the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Interloper, as if the Liberty of doing Wrong
was re&s;tor'd among the other Freedoms of
the Nation, by the Revolution, began from
that Time to appear openly; Fit out Ships
here in the Face of Goverment; and appear
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in Defiance of the
Company's Forts, carrying on an open Trade
without Regard to the Laws of the Land
or the Lawful Privileges of the Company.</P>
<P>It could not be, but that &s;uch an Open
Inva&s;ion of their Trade mu&s;t be a great
Di&s;couragement, as well as a great Lo&s;s to
the Company: E&s;pecially, con&s;idering
two great Things that attended it, 1. The
&s;ubtle but unfair and di&s;honourable Me|thods
which the&s;e Interlopers took, to car|ry
on their Trade to <HI>Africa.</HI> Such as Bri|bing
the Company's Officers and Factors
Abroad; confederating and corre&s;ponding
with the Company's Enemies in <HI>Africa,</HI>
whether Natives or <HI>Europeans;</HI> running
down the Price of their Goods to the
Negroes, teaching them the Craft and
Knowledge of the Trade, and how to Buy
and Sell to their Advantage; rai&s;ing the
Rates of the Slaves they buy; and thus in
every Article rendring the Company's
Trade more difficult to manage, and le&s;s
profitable than it was before. 2. The Dif|ficulty,
and, as it appear'd at la&s;t, the Im|po&s;&s;ibility
of obtaining Redre&s;s of the&s;e
Grievances, or Gaining any New Confir|mation
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of the exclu&s;ive Privileges, on the
Foot of which their Trade had flouri&s;h'd
for &s;o many Years before.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o far was the Company from re|ceiving
A&s;&s;i&s;tance at Home, again&s;t tho&s;e
People who daily made Havock of their
Trade, and grew Rich upon the Spoil of
the Company; that on the contrary, the
Impunity of the Times hardened the &s;aid
Interlopers to go on, and claim that for a
Right, which they had nothing but their
own Practice to ju&s;tify; as if the long break|ing
in upon a legal Con&s;titution had di|ve&s;ted
that Con&s;titution of its Foundation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things running to a height, In|terloping
became Popular, and the Com|pany
had a ju&s;t Alarm, from having &s;een
the Books for a New Sub&s;cription to the
<HI>India</HI> Trade laid open, and the Interlopers
of that Trade Incorporated in a di&s;tinct
Society: Tho' the Nece&s;&s;ity of their re|turning
into the Hands of the Old Compa|ny,
&s;oon brought them into a Coallition.
Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>African</HI> Company were al|larm'd
with this Precedent, if they ap|pear'd
apprehen&s;ive of the like Inva&s;ion
of their Trade, and expected every Day
when their Interlopers would be al&s;o
Incorporated into a New Company: The
&s;aid Interlopers them&s;elves deliver'd them
from that Fear when they &s;oon let them
<PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y">
&s;ee, that it was not the Setting up again&s;t
the Company, but an utter Di&s;&s;olution of
the Company, and laying open, <HI>Anglic&egrave;</HI>
blowing up the Trade, was in their
View.</P>
<P>Not to enter into a Detail of their Pra|ctices
to this Purpo&s;e, which yet are many
and very vi&s;ible, the Variety of which
would very well bear a Hi&s;tory, and long
Accounts of which have been already
made Publick; it &s;hall &s;uffice to note,
that the Company langui&s;hing under the
In&s;olence and Oppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e In|va&s;ions,
and at the &s;ame time lying
under many di&s;couraging Lo&s;&s;es by the
War, re&s;olved (that they might rather
&s;ave the Trade to the Nation, than enjoy
the Profits of it) to take them into, what
they could not keep them out of; and ra|ther
grant &s;omething upon Conditions of
&s;aving the re&s;t, than &s;ee the whole de|voured
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who in a &s;hort time
would effectually de&s;troy both.</P>
<P>Upon this Principle the Company ap|ply'd
them&s;elves to the Parliament about the
Year 1698, and obtained an Act to permit
all People who thought fit to Adventure,
to Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI> and from thence to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, paying only to the Com|pany
the rate of 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> be&s;ides the
ordinary Duties to the Crown: Which Ten
<HI>per Cent.</HI> was of the
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Forts, Ca&s;tles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for receiving the
Protection of them in their Trade.</P>
<P>It would be worth while here, and in
the pur&s;uit of the&s;e Papers We &s;hall not fail,
in order to let indifferent People judge of
the Pretences on both &s;ides, to examine
the Dimen&s;ions of the Trade, the Export
and Import from and to <HI>England,</HI> the Num|ber
of Negroes &s;ent to the Colonies in the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the Price which is given
there now for them; and comparing the&s;e
with the like Article of the Trade during
the Company's free Enjoyment of their
exclu&s;ive Privileges, draw a State of the
Difference; that it may be plain to every
Man's Eye, who are or are not the be&s;t
qualify'd to carry on this great and advan|tageous
Trade for the Good of the Nation.
But We adjourn this for a little.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament for Granting this
Liberty of Commerce, upon the Payment
of the Sum afore&s;aid, has done the Inter|lopers
one Favour, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it has le|gitimated
them under a New Name, di&s;|daining
the &s;candalous Title of Interlopers,
which are indeed but the Raparees or
Highway-men of Trade; They have chri|&s;tened
them&s;elves by the Name or Title of
10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Men, <HI>alias</HI> Separate Traders,
and by this new Dignity we are to under|&s;tand
them.</P>
<P>The Company, as it may well be ima|gin'd,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
under the Torture of this growing
Evil, like a Body under the Weight of a
cruel and incurable Di&s;ea&s;e, has &s;en&s;ibly
wa&s;ted and decay'd, &s;uffer'd innumerable
Inconveniences and Di&s;couragements, e|nough
to &s;ink them far lower than they are
yet fallen.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Decay of their Trade has
made the Charge of maintaining their Set|tlement
be an Article that has continually
fed upon their Dead Stock, and eaten long
upon their Capital; the Charge being the
&s;ame as when their Trade was mo&s;t Flou|ri&s;hing;
the 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which was
allow'd them by Act of Parliament go|ing
but a very little way to defray the
Charge.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> As they have grown weaker and
le&s;s able to protect their Trade, &s;o that
Weakne&s;s has happened at a time when
their Strength was mo&s;t needful; having
not only the Natives on Shore to re&s;i&s;t,
but the Enemies of <HI>England</HI> to contend
with, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>And here it is humbly noted, in behalf
of the Company, That their Forts
and Ca&s;tles indeed were built for the
Defence and Protection of their Com|merce,
either again&s;t the In&s;ults of
the <HI>African</HI> Natives, or the Encroach|ments
of the Trading Force of other
Nations; &s;uch as the <HI>Dutch, French,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"><HI>Danes, Pru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> And
they are able and &s;ufficient to defend
them&s;elves and their Trade again&s;t
any or all of them, as Traders. But
it is own'd, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French,</HI>
or any other come to make War with
us, and &s;end regular Forces, Squa|drons
and Armies, we are not pre|par'd
for &s;uch Work as that. It can|not
be expected, a private Society of
Merchants can be at an Expence for
it, or Maintain Garri&s;ons to defend
&s;uch Forts as might re&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a
Ca&s;e; nor could any of tho&s;e Nations
re&s;i&s;t ours in like Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>And therefore they have &s;uffered irrepa|rable
Damage and Lo&s;&s;es by the Attacks
which the <HI>French</HI> have made upon them
during this War; by which &s;everal of their
Forts and Settlements have been de&s;try'd,
their Effects plundred, their Servants and
Factors carried away, and the Charges
laid out, as well as the Trade it &s;elf, lo&s;t
together.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> They have &s;u&s;tained other Great
Lo&s;&s;es, both at Sea and Land, unu&s;ual;
and they believe to any Society of
Men in Trade, intollerable; &s;uch as</P>
<P>Taking their Ships by the Enemy,
the Hurricane at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c.
the De&s;cent of the <HI>French</HI> upon
the I&s;lands of <HI>Mevis</HI> and St. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and by Shipwreck; all which
put together, as they have repre&s;ent|ed
it to the Government, amount to
above 400000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>The Company's being reduc'd to great
Difficulties and Extremities under all this,
can be &s;trange to no Body; nor is it to be
wondred, that to keep them&s;elves up, and
to pre&s;erve a Trade in it &s;elf &s;o benefical, in
hopes at one time or other to recover them|&s;elves
by the Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Government, they have call'd in great
Sums of Money out of the private E&s;tates
of the Adventurers; and owe great Sums
upon the Common Seal of their Company.
Of all which things the Separate Traders
make their pre&s;ent Advantage; as if the
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Difficulties the Company la|bours
under, were a good Rea&s;on why
there &s;hould be no Company at all. Where|as,
were the Company &s;et free from the
A&s;&s;aults and Encroachments of the&s;e Py|rates,
and re&s;tor'd to the legal Privileges
of their Charter, they would &s;oon both re|&s;tore
them&s;elves by the Trade, and re&s;tore
the Trade to the Nation.</P>
<P>If we were permitted to Argue for the
Company, by the u&s;ual Topicks which en|force
things in other Ca&s;es; the Heavy
Lo&s;&s;es, the Difficulty and Di&s;&s;a&s;ters, which
the Adventurers and Creditors have had in
all the&s;e Particulars; the &s;everal Sums of
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Money call'd in, the long time they have
been out of both Principal and Intere&s;t,
would be of &s;ome weight to move tho&s;e in
who&s;e Power it lies to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them,
that by a fair hone&s;t Application to the
Trade they might re&s;tore their Affairs and
make up their Lo&s;&s;es again; E&s;pecially
when the giving them &s;uch Preferences,
con&s;i&s;ts with the pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring
the Trade, to the Advantage of the Na|tion.
But on the contrary, the Clamours
of the&s;e People, have made the very Mi&s;|fortunes
of the Company Arguments to
ruin them; as if the Creditors of a Trad&s;e|man
&s;hould be excited to be more &s;evere
upon him than they would be, becau&s;e he
has had his Hou&s;e Burnt, or becau&s;e
Thieves have Broke up his Shop and
Robb'd him, which Di&s;ta&s;ter would move
Men of Rea&s;on to Forbear and Encourage
him.</P>
<P>But much &s;tronger will this Argument
be, when it &s;hall appear in the Company's
Favour, that private Intere&s;t, Plunder of
the Company's Effects, and violent taking
away the Property of other Men, appears
to be the chief View of the Separate Tra|ders;
and that they are &s;o far from aim|ing
at the Publick Advantage, by &s;ecuring
the Trade to the Nation, that on the con|trary,
they do not pretend to give, nor
are they able to offer any Security that
<PB N="20" REF="19">
can be Depended upon to that purpo&s;e,
and by the Nature of the thing, it &s;eems
morrally Impo&s;&s;ible, but the Trade mu&s;t
dye in their Hands, and be Irrecoverably
Lo&s;t to the Nation.</P>
<P>This &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Company's
Affairs brings us down to the pre&s;ent
Times; and this is the true De&s;ign of
making it thus Public; al&s;o it gives any
one that plea&s;es impartially to con&s;ider it,
a clear View of the true Ri&s;e and Founda|tion
of all the Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>African</HI> Trade,
with the Capacity the Companies Ene|mies
are in to hurt them, and by Con&s;e|quence
a View of the proper Remedy for
tho&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>From this brief Account al&s;o An&s;wers
will indeed form them&s;elves to mo&s;t of
the Cavils of the pre&s;ent Oppo&s;ers of the
Company; as to the U&s;efulne&s;s, the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and the Right of Property which
the Company have in the Forts in <HI>Africa;</HI>
it will convince the impartial Reader,
as to the &s;everal Circum&s;tances of the Com|pany,
and their Incapacity either to carry
on the Trade, or to &s;atisfie their Creditors;
al&s;o as to the Nature of the Trade, and
whether laying it open, or limiting it, is the
be&s;t Method to pre&s;erve it; of which the
Separate Traders them&s;elves have made
woful Experiments; and as to &s;everal o|ther
Objections, to which we &s;hall &s;peak
their Turn.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
The Company langui&s;hing under the&s;e
Difficulties, finding it in vain to &s;truggle
any longer with their Misfortunes, and re|&s;olved
to put it to the trial, whether they
or the Separate Traders had mo&s;t Right
to, and the be&s;t Plea for the Trade; and
very loth both the Trade it &s;elf &s;hould &s;ink

them&s;elves to the Parliament in the
Year 1709. by their Petition &s;etting forth
their Circum&s;tances, Praying a Confir|mation
of their Priviledges, and an E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of their Company, as then de|&s;ign'd
for a New Sub&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the Pur&s;uit of this Petition, the Com|mons
having referr'd it to a Committee of
the whole Hou&s;e, and the Separate Tra|ders
having al&s;o petition'd to be heard a|gain&s;t
them, &s;everal Hearings were ob|tain'd
on both Sides; wherein the Per&s;ons
who appear'd for the Separate Traders,
treated the Company with all the Indigni|ty
and Indecency that they could po&s;&s;ibly
beftow, con&s;i&s;tent with the Place they were
in; bringing their own Servants to betray
the Secrets committed to them, when un|der
Pay and Employment; betraying the
Privacies of Conver&s;ation, and Letters of
Friend&s;hip; and all po&s;&s;ible Methods were
us'd to blacken the Company's Proceedings
of which nothing more need be &s;aid than,
this, That they had the full Satisfaction of
<PB N="22" REF="21">
doing the Company's Reputation &s;ome
Harm, and convincing the World they had
no Regard at all to their own; &s;ome of
their Witne&s;&s;es not &s;ticking to own the
greate&s;t Villanies, upon a Suppo&s;ition that
they &s;hould have it believ'd, that the Com|pany
had approv'd of them, as done in
their Service. But failing in producing
either Authority from, or Approbation
of the Company in &s;uch Things, they
effectually branded them&s;elves fir&s;t, and
yet failed in the main De&s;ign of Reproach|ing
their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Pleadings, or rather Scoldings, on
both Sides being over, and the Separate
Traders having, as they thought, brought
their Bu&s;ine&s;s to an I&s;&s;ue; in the Mid&s;t of
their Triumphs, they run them&s;elves upon
a Rock which &s;plit their Cau&s;e; And be|ing
Shipwreck'd to all Intents and Purpo|&s;es,
the Parliament broke up, without be|ing
able to do any thing for them, or in|deed
without their putting them&s;elves into
a Condition to make it po&s;&s;ible for that
Parliament to do any thing for them, or
they to expect it; unle&s;s they had expected
the Hou&s;e &s;hould have acted again&s;t their
own Judgment, again&s;t the Sen&s;e of the
People, again&s;t the Nature of the Thing,
and again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Whole Na|tion;
and thus like the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> at
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<HI>Villa Vitio&s;a,</HI> they got the Victory, but
they lo&s;t the Day.</P>
<P>It is true neverthele&s;s, that how much
Reproach &s;oever their Cau&s;e obtain'd, and
how ill &s;oever they lookt in the Eyes of in|different
Men; And tho' their Failing at
la&s;t overthrew them, and cau&s;ed the Hou&s;e
to drop their propo&s;ed Chimaera of a Com|pany
and no Company, of which we may
&s;peak hereafter: Yet the Negative this
Delay gave the Company in their propos'd
E&s;tabli&s;hment, left them and the Trade
with them in the &s;ame langui&s;hing Condi|tion
they were in before, or rather wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rock which as is &s;aid Shipwreckt
the whole Project, and in mid&s;t of their Tri|umph
&s;plit all their Cau&s;e, was this; the
Want of being able to propo&s;e a real and
&s;ub&s;tantial Security for the Pre&s;ervation of
the Trade, to the Nation. This was al|low'd
to be nece&s;&s;ary, as without which
the Hou&s;e could not make any Thing that
was to be done for them rational: But when
all their Propo&s;als were lookt into, not the
Security it &s;elf only was mi&s;&s;ing; but no
Foundation or po&s;&s;ible Foot upon which
any &s;uch Security could be form'd was to
be found; at which &s;ome of their be&s;t
Friends grew very much a&s;ham'd of their
Cau&s;e, and appear'd no more in their Be|half,
for Fear of being oblig'd to blu&s;h for
them.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Nor was this Rock an Error of Pilotage,
which with better Conduct they might
have avoieed: It was not a Rock under
Water, or in the Dark: It was an open
Plain and Mountain-Difficulty. They &s;aw
it clearly; every Body told them of it; the
publick Prints warn'd them of it; the Au|thor
of the <HI>Review</HI> banter'd them with it,
and challeng'd them to avoid it if they
could. But their Cau&s;e would &s;teer no
other Cour&s;e; it was built upon Po&s;&s;ibili|ties
hardly po&s;&s;ible, and &s;plit upon the Pro|babilities
hardly probable.</P>
<P>And indeed the relating this Hi&s;torically,
&s;eems to be the mo&s;t Convincing and the
Keene&s;t way of Arguing that can be made
u&s;e of in this Ca&s;e. The Company were &s;eem|ingly
Ca&s;t in their Cau&s;e, the Stream both
in the Hou&s;e and el&s;ewhere was again&s;t
them; the Separate Traders cry'd <HI>Victoria,</HI>
and thought the Day was their own: Why
did they not then obtain the Settlement
their own Way? Why did not the Parlia|ment
do the Work as they de&s;ired? Why
were not the Schemes they offered put into
a Bill and brought to the Vote? The Rea|&s;on
was Plain, and will be a Rea&s;on for
ever, neither that Parliament did, nor
any Parliament with their Eyes open
ever can E&s;tabli&s;h them, or &s;et up the
Trade their Way, (Viz.) Becau&s;e they
propo&s;ed no Foundation to make it ratio|nal,
<PB N="25" REF="24">
no Sub&s;tance to build on, nothing
that look'd like a Security for the Nation,
<HI>And why did they not?</HI> The An&s;wer is Plain,
they did not becau&s;e they could not, the
Men were not Fools, but the Nature of the
thing would not bear it, the Propo&s;al had
nothing of that kind in it, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble,&mdash;and
it is &s;o &s;till, <HI>let them do it if they
can,</HI> and no Man can be &s;o Unju&s;t to any
Parliament as to think they will ever &s;ettle
the Trade without &s;uch a Security.</P>
<P>However this was, yet as above, it
the left Company's Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ine&s;s undone, and
their Affairs un&s;ettl'd, a Thing, which,
as it was fatal to them, &s;o it &s;eem'd to
be the utmo&s;t that the other People ex|pected,
as what they &s;uppos'd would at
la&s;t be the Ruin of the Company, with|out
any Help: And no doubt they took
their Aim here much righter than they
did in any Thing el&s;e; &s;ome of them ha|ving
been heard to &s;ay, They car'd not
whether the Parliament did any Thing or
no, provided they did but delay the Com|pany;
for then they knew the Thing would
fall into their Hands of Cour&s;e, the Com|pany
not being able to &s;tand of them&s;elves,
without &s;ome Act was pa&s;&s;ed in their Fa|vour,
which they had nothing to do but to
prevent.</P>
<P>It is true, This Pro&s;pect &s;eem'd more
rational to them at that Time, than it has
<PB N="26" REF="25">
done &s;ince; and they had but too much
Rea&s;on for that wicked Sugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>The CASE was this:</P>
<P>The Company had taken in Great Sums
of Money upon Bonds, under their Com|mon
Seal at Intere&s;t, after the Rate
of Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Whole amounting to
near 200000<HI>l.</HI> Several Propo&s;als for the Sa|tisfying
this Debt had been made by the
Company; all which, however well found|ed,
were rendred Abortive by the Practices
of the&s;e People call'd Separate Traders; and
not only &s;o, but many of them bought up
the Company's Bonds, that &s;o becoming Cre|ditors,
they might both by the Authority
of their Bond, as well as Example, prevent
the Creditors coming into any &s;uch Propo|&s;al
however rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Bonds were put in Suit
again&s;t the Company, and &s;ome very hard
Things done on tho&s;e Heads, which we care
not to repeat, becau&s;e they may oblige us
to de&s;cend to Per&s;onal Reflections, which
&s;hall be avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Pro&s;ecutions the Company's Af|fairs
were &s;till farther embarra&s;s'd, their
Commerce interrupted, their Ships &s;topt,
their Effects attach'd, and all po&s;&s;ible In|&s;ults
offer'd them upon every Occa&s;ion, as
well to perplex and di&s;courage them in their
Affairs as to run down their Credit, and in
<PB N="27" REF="26">
the End oblige them to break up and
di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>To counter-act the&s;e wicked De&s;igns and
if po&s;&s;ible to defeat them in their Grand
Hopes, the Company &s;et on Foot &s;everal
Propo&s;als, at &s;everal Times, to their Cre|ditors.</P>
<P>1. A Propo&s;al of a&s;&s;igning over their
Forts, Factories, and Settlements, with
all their Quick and Dead Stock, into a
New Sub&s;cription, at a certain Rate, in or|der
to have both the &s;aid Stock and Im|provement
apply'd to the Payment of their
whole Debt, as well Principal as Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>2. A Propo&s;al of a certain Majority of
their Creditors in Number and Value, be|ing
impowered to accept &s;uch Terms and
Propo&s;als as the Company &s;hould make
for the Payment of their whole Debt with
Intere&s;t, and that the re&s;t &s;hould be bound
by &s;uch Agreement.</P>
<P>3. A Coallition or Encorporation of
their Debts with the Stock of the Compa|ny,
for the Carrying on the Trade: The
Conditions of tho&s;e Propo&s;als, E&s;pecially
the la&s;t, were &s;o fair, and the De&s;ign
&s;o vi&s;ibly Hone&s;t; &s;o Calculated for the Sa|tisfaction
of the Creditors, and the Pre&s;er|vation
of the Trade together, that the
Town was for &s;ome time in hopes none
could have &s;tood &s;o much in their own
Light, as to have refu&s;ed them, and a very
<PB N="28" REF="27">
great Number of the Creditors came rea|dily
into them.</P>
<P>But it could not be Expected that the
Separate Traders, who were Creditors,
whether by real Original Loan, or Politick
Purcha&s;e as afore&s;aid, and had another
Game to play, would comply with the&s;e
or any other Propo&s;als for the Pre&s;ervation
of that, which it was manife&s;t they de|&s;ign'd
to De&s;troy; and therefore the Dif|ficulty
in the&s;e Propo&s;als were many.&mdash;The
Separate Traders both openly, by &s;tan|ding
out them&s;elves in their Bond Capacity;
and underhand by their Private, but &s;ince
known Solicitations, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t
Endeavours to prevent this De&s;ign, <HI>however
fair,</HI> coming to any Head.</P>
<P>The Company finding that in the Con|clu&s;ion
their Affair in Parliament, was
like either to be delay'd, <HI>the Se&s;&s;ion draw|ing
near a Clo&s;e,</HI> or to go again&s;t them
in the Hou&s;e; Pre&s;ented a mo&s;t Humble
Petition to the Hou&s;e, tending to the Sa|tisfaction
of their Creditors, &s;etting forth
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of Improving their Ef|fects
in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible for that
End, and Praying that what the Majority
in Number and Value of their Creditors,
might agree to, might bind the re&s;t; a Fa|vour
granted to Private Traders, in ca&s;e of
their Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;&s;a&s;ters, and thought
to be much more Rea&s;onably expected here
<PB N="29" REF="28">
The Separate Traders on the other hand,
get &s;ome of them&s;elves, being Bond Credi|tors
as well as Separate Traders, to Petiti|on
again&s;t this, Praying to have the Com|pany
Dive&s;ted of their E&s;tate in their Forts
and Ca&s;tles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to have tho&s;e Forts
and Ca&s;tles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ve&s;ted in the Cre|ditors,
with Power to Sell them, towards
Satisfaction of their Debts.</P>
<P>The&s;e were certainly the fir&s;t Creditors
that ever Petitioned that they might have
but part of their Debt, when they might
have had the whole; but the De&s;ign was
Evident, <HI>as for the Hone&s;ty of it I &s;hall let
that alone,</HI> (Viz.) that this was the only
Turn they could give to the Company, by
which they might come at what they wan|ted,
(Viz.) a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Forts and
Ca&s;tles; for had the&s;e Gentlemen obtained
a Power to &s;ell the &s;aid Forts and Ca&s;tles,
as by &s;uch an Act of Parliament would have
been given them, they had no more to do,
but to Sell them to them&s;elves at &s;uch Sum
or Price, as they &s;hould think fit, and the
Affair had been at an End.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not Venture to &s;ay, what pro|bability
there was; as things run at that
time, of obtaining this Reque&s;t, however
hard and Unrea&s;onable. But the Se&s;&s;ion
drawing to an End, there was no time left
for the&s;e things, and &s;o the Parliament
broke up and nothing was done in it, but
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Company was left to &s;truggle with their
own Difficulties, and to langui&s;h another
Year in the Decay it was brought to, by
the Particulars afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Two Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament pa&s;t in this
manner, the Proceedings both of the Com|pany,
the Separate Traders, and of the
Hou&s;e being much the &s;ame, and the Con|clu&s;ion
the &s;ame, (Viz.) leaving the
Trade un&s;ettled and the Company weaker
and weaker, drawing on, as we may &s;ay, to
its Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>When the Company &s;aw their own Con|dition
&s;till growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and
no vi&s;ible Pro&s;pect of Relief, by their Ap|plication
to Parliament, they re&s;olve to try
if they could come to &s;ome tollerable A|greement
with their Creditors, that if po&s;|&s;ible
they might put them in a way to be
paid, and at the &s;ame time to pre&s;erve the
Trade; and this was by making the third
Propo&s;al mentioned, (Viz.) a Coallition
or Encorporating their Debt together with
the Stock of the Company; &s;o that both to|gether
making one new Fund, together
with &s;uch Addition as was propo&s;ed in the
Articles of Coallition for the carrying on
the Trade, and this upon the Foot of their
pre&s;ent Charter; that thus being at once free
from the Embar&s;&s;aments of their Debt, they
might carry on a clear Trade, the Profits
whereof in time, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ri&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="30">
high enough to An&s;wer the &s;aid Debt and
Stock, as if paid off by the Company.</P>
<P>This New Birth &s;uffered &s;trong Travel in
its bringing Forth, and all the la&s;t Year
was &s;pent in vain to effect it; the Separate
Traders having done their utmo&s;t to render
it Abortive. But at la&s;t it has taken Effect
and appears Perfect. The Creditors have|ing
their Eyes open to their true Intere&s;t,
and beginning to &s;ee every Day plainer
than before the De&s;tructive De&s;igns of the
Separate Traders, who con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed
every thing that might tend to the Settle|ment
of the Company's Affairs, and that
meerly as tending to &s;uch Settlement.</P>
<P>And now we &s;ee the Creditors and the
Company fully agreed, and joyning in
their Applications to the Parliament, for
Confirming their Agreement, and E&s;ta|bli&s;hing
them as One Company, for the
carrying on the Trade. Now the Cla|mour
of Creditors is at an End; the Cry
that they cannot pay their Debts is Over;
They Owe nothing, for it is all put to one
Common-Stock, and Creditors and Adven|turers,
make now One Company. What
the Separate Traders can now have to &s;ay
again&s;t it, what Preten&s;ions they can make
now to a Right in, or what Demands to a
Share of the Trade, &s;eparate from the Com|pany,
what Security they can give for the
Pre&s;ervation of the Trade, if they had it;
<PB N="32" REF="31">
What A&s;&s;urances of Supplying the Colony's
with Negroes, and at what Price; what
Quantity of Manufactures they will Engage
to carry out of <HI>England,</HI> and what Ship|ping
to Employ?</P>
<P>The&s;e all as material Articles for the
Pro&s;perity of our General Commerce, and
for the Encouragement of our Plantations,
are very proper Que&s;tions to be ask'd
them, and no doubt will be ask'd of them

they give to them and what Deficien|cies
their Propo&s;als may have as to the&s;e

<P>In the mean time to fini&s;h this Di&s;|cour&s;e,
and that the Gentlemen who are
now to take Cognizance of this Affair,
may have a true Notion of the Ca&s;e, and a
full Knowledge of what has already pa&s;s'd

<P>Fir&s;t it is to be ob&s;erved, that upon this

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lords commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and
Plantations, having under their Con&s;i|deration
the Scheme propo&s;ed by the Separate
Traders, for carrying on the Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI>
to which Scheme &s;ome Objections are made;
and their Lord&s;hip having thereupon fram'd
three Queries, and tran&s;mitted the &s;ame to the
Separate Traders for their An&s;wer Thereto;
I am directed to &s;end you the Enclo&s;ed Copy of
the Queries, to be by you Communicated to the
Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, who&s;e Attendanee is
de&s;ired at the Board, at 10 a Clock on <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI>
Morning the 23d In&s;tant; and that the
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Company may then come prepared to lay before
their Lord&s;hips what they have to offer upon
tho&s;e Queries, at which time the Separate Tra|ders

<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t humble Servant,
<HI>William Popple.</HI></SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>Queries for the Separate Traders to Africa.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHat Security can there be, that the
Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI> if laid open, &s;hould
be Pre&s;erved, &s;o as to produce a Certain Suffi|cient
Fund, for maintaining &s;uch Forts and
Settlements on that Coa&s;t, as &s;hall be found ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
to be ve&s;ted in, or at any time hereaf|ter
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and maintained by the Crown, for
Pre&s;erving, Carrying on and Improving the
Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How will there be a &s;ufficient Stock of
Goods always lying ready in the &s;everal Forts,
to be from time to time, as occa&s;ion &s;hall re|quire,
Charg'd or Di&s;pos'd of, for Pre&s;erving,
Securing and Encrea&s;ing the number of Con|tracts
and Alliances with the Natives, and the
&s;everal Neighbouring Petty Kings of the Coun|try;
and for Encrea&s;ing the number of Forts
and Settlements, as mentioned in the foregoing
Query, with Sufficient and Proper Powers for
tho&s;e Purpo&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="37" REF="36">
3. What have you to &s;ay in An&s;wer to what
is Objected, if the Trade be Open, and there
are &s;everal Sellers and Buyers of Goods from
<HI>Great Britain</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> that
tho&s;e Goods will be greatly Depreciated, and
tho&s;e of the Natives as much Enhanced by
them.</ITEM>

</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To the&s;e Queries the Company humbly
Pre&s;ented, by way of An&s;wer, &s;everal
Heads of Ob&s;ervation, and then prepared to
Petition the Parliament once more, in or|der
to obtain &s;uch an Act as may Effectu|ally
Unite the &s;aid Company and Credi|tors,
and Confirm to them the Antient
Priviledges of their Charter, which Petiti|on
is now depending before the Hou&s;e, and
all the Reports and Proceedings of the
Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade, and Pa|pers
relating thereto, are Ordered to be
laid before the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;hort Re-capitulation of the Af|fair
&s;eems to carry with it a clear Vindi|cation
of the <HI>African Company,</HI> and an An|&s;wer
to all the Objections of their Enemies;
for it is ob&s;ervable, that in mo&s;t Ca&s;es
where Truth is on the Side, a clear rela|tion
of Matter of Fact is the be&s;t Vindica|tion;
for Truth is always mo&s;t clearly ex|plain'd
by it &s;elf, and Hi&s;tory, rather than
Argument, pleads an Hone&s;t Cau&s;e be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Impartial Reader therefore is re|ferr'd
to the Matter of Fact, which is thus
faithfully related, and is made Judge of
<PB N="38" REF="37">
the Merits of the Cau&s;e, by being made
Ma&s;ter of the Story. The Company &s;eeks
no better Vindication than the Judgment
of Impartial Men, when tho&s;e Impartial
Men &s;hall be rightly inform'd; and they
are per&s;waded that mo&s;t of the Gentlemen
in <HI>England,</HI> who have appear'd in their
Opinion again&s;t them, have done &s;o more
for want of right Information, than any
other Defect.</P>
<P>The Weakne&s;s of the An&s;wers, the Cla|mour
and the Noi&s;e, which the Separate
Traders have made, tho' they may have
amu&s;ed the World a little, have hitherto a|mounted
to &s;o little, that they have not
been able to obtain One Re&s;olution in fa|vour
of their particular Schemes; nor have
they been ever able to give One direct
An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Query before-men|tion'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> How they can &s;ecure the
Trade to this Kingdom, which all Sides
agree, mu&s;t not be lo&s;t?</P>
<P>If, after this, they will proceed to oppo&s;e
&s;uch clear Arguments, if they have any
thing to alledge again&s;t the pre&s;erving the
Trade in a Company, and the paying Two
Thou&s;and Families of Creditors a ju&s;t
Debt, many of whom wou'd be utterly
ruin'd in the Lo&s;s. If they have any more
Sugge&s;tions, Po&s;&s;ibilities and Probabilities
to offer, in&s;tead of real Securities, it's hoped
the Hou&s;e will give them their due Cen|&s;ure,
&s;ince there &s;eems nothing to be ask'd
<PB N="39" REF="38">
but this &s;hort Que&s;tion, <HI>Who can &s;ecure
the Trade, and who cannot?</HI></P>
<P>This Que&s;tion the Separate Traders
could never yet be brought to &s;peak directly
to; in all their An&s;wers, and in all their
Papers, they &s;hift and &s;huffle it off, they
run out to Clamour at the Company, and
cry out of Monopoly; examine the Defect
of Exportations, and the Decay of the
Trade, and reflect upon the Companies
bad Succe&s;s; the Rea&s;ons of which are all
in them&s;elves, as appears by what has been
&s;aid. But not a word appears in all their
Papers given in, or in all their Pleadings
in the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> to &s;ecure the
Trade; all their Schemes are empty of
this main Point, tho' this is the only Que|&s;tion
upon which the whole matter turns.</P>
<P>They have &s;ometimes mention'd it when
it has been put &s;o clo&s;e to them that they
could no longer &s;hift it off; and then they
tell the World, there is no doubt but the
Mony to be rai&s;ed will be &s;ufficient; and
it is highly probable, and the like. But it
is humbly referr'd to all Impartial Judg|ments,
whether the&s;e are things for a Na|tion
to be &s;atisfy'd with, and for a Parlia|ment
to grant an E&s;tabli&s;hment upon?
Whether the Government in their ju&s;t re|gard
for the pre&s;ervation of the Trade,
ought to depend upon Probabilities and
Po&s;&s;ibilities, without a real Security, in a
thing of this Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
All the Foundation upon which the Se|parate
Traders have &s;ugge&s;ted the Trade
&s;hould be maintain'd, is, That it being left
Open and Free to all Men to Trade, the
Merchants will launch out into Trade, and
&s;end a great number of Ships and Goods
every Year to <HI>Africa,</HI> out of which a cer|tain
Mulct, or Fine, &s;hall be laid to rai&s;e
Money for the &s;upport of their Trade, and
maintaining &s;uch Forts and Factories as
they think needful; and this they call a
Security, and indeed this is all the Security
they can propo&s;e.</P>
<P>If then this Security be duly examin'd,
and the Uncertainties and Weakne&s;s of the
Pretences laid open, it cannot be doubted
but the Honourable Members of Parlia|ment,
who are not to be &s;uppo&s;ed ea&s;ie
to be Impo&s;ed upon, will &s;ee thro' the
Fallacy, and reject &s;uch an Attempt to a|bu&s;e
the Nation, with the ju&s;t Contempt
that it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>To this End it is humbly recommend|ed
to the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons
to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>1. It is &s;ugge&s;ted, the Merchants will
launch out into the Trade when it is laid
Open and Free; and as long as they can
carry it on to their Advantage, we may,
without prejudice to the Argument, grant
they will, or at lea&s;t may do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40">
But &s;uppo&s;ing, <HI>which al&s;o is very rational
to &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that a time may come when that
Gain may &s;top, or cea&s;e for a Time: It is
evident to all Men, that the carrying on
the Trade will always depend upon the
Gain of the Trade; and if by the Accident
of War, any Inva&s;ion from Neighbours, a|ny
Difficulties with the Natives, or any
other contingent Ca&s;ualties, which that
Trade is &s;ubject to more than other Trades.
The Gain of the Trade cea&s;es, <HI>the Trade
cea&s;es of cour&s;e;</HI> and if the Trade cea&s;es,
or declines, the Tax to be rai&s;ed for the
Maintenance of the Forts and Ca&s;tles cea|&s;es,
or is proportionably reduc'd.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> As the Difficulties of the Trade
decrea&s;e, it is evident the Expence of tho&s;e
Forts and Ca&s;tles, and Settlements always
encrea&s;e; the carrying on Wars with the
Natives, the Exorbitances of Pre&s;ents, and
Expences among &s;uch of them as are to be
kept in Friend&s;hip, encrea&s;e. If then the
Expences encrea&s;e by the &s;ame Ca&s;ualty
that makes the Tax to maintain it decline;
It is a mo&s;t rational Con&s;equence, that tho&s;e
two Circum&s;tances tend to a Di&s;&s;olution of
the Trade.</P>
<P>2. It is &s;ugge&s;ted, that there is no doubt
but the Money to be rai&s;ed, will exceed
the Charge of maintaing the Forts and
Ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>This has been &s;o left to the uncertainty
of a loo&s;e A&s;&s;ertion, that it &s;eems to leave
the Ca&s;e more to be doubted, and is a
<PB N="42" REF="41">
meer begging the Que&s;tion of the Com|pany.</P>
<P>For if no Man is bound to Trade to any
Sum, if no Man is oblig'd to Trade far|ther
than he plea&s;es, which is ju&s;t as far as
his Profit invites; if that Profit cea&s;es as
above, why &s;hou'd we think the Man will
Trade? So that in&s;tead of not doubting but
the Trade will &s;upport it &s;elf, it is out of
doubt that it will not, in ca&s;e of Accident
as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>3. As there is no Obligation to any Man
to Trade longer than Advantage prompts
him to it; &s;o the Separate Traders never
yet offer'd, nor can they bring in a Num|ber
of Men that would be per&s;onally bound,
<HI>even tho' the Advantages of the Trade &s;hould
continue,</HI> that they would Trade to &s;uch
or &s;uch a degree. This leaves the Trade
in &s;uch an Uncertainty, that no dependance
can be propo&s;ed, either for the Encourage|ment
of our Manufactures, or the Supply of
<HI>Negroes</HI> to our Colonies. Nor is this an
Omi&s;&s;ion of the Separate Traders; a thing
forgotten by them, or which they may
make up when it is demanded of them.
The Hou&s;e may &s;oon put them to the Te&s;t
in the&s;e things; they cannot bring a Num|ber
of Men together that will be bound in
their &s;eparate Capacities to do the&s;e things,
either to Trade at all, in ca&s;e of Lo&s;s, or
War, or to a certain degree in times of
Peace, and Currency of Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
If the&s;e things are &s;o, it is humbly left
to any indifferent Judgement to ob&s;erve,
upon what Foundation the Trade, if laid
Open, is like to &s;tand. How the Nation
&s;hall be Treated, if by any Accident of
War, or otherwi&s;e, the Traders &s;hall de|cline,
or di&s;continue their Exports; and
what Condition our Colonies &s;hall be like
to fall into, when no Men are oblig'd by
Authority to &s;upply them with <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>4. By the &s;ame Rule there can be no
Security obtain'd from the&s;e Free Traders,
as to the Quantity of Goods of the Growth
and Manufacture of <HI>Britain</HI> they will Ex|port,
or as to the Number of Negroes they
&s;hall carry Yearly for the &s;upply of our
Plantations. Upon both which Articles
the U&s;efulne&s;s of the Trade does depend;
and which is &s;till more, they cannot ea&s;ily
be brought to &s;tated and certain Prices for
which tho&s;e Negroes &s;hall be Deliver'd;
but as by their Means the Price of Negroes
has been brought from 20 to 40, and 45 <HI>l.
per</HI> Head, to the great Oppre&s;&s;ion and Di&s;|couragement
of the Plantations; &s;o they
&s;till will be at Liberty by the Scarcity of
their Number, to Extort from the Planters
what Exorbitant Price they think fit.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are &s;o Evident, and have
appear'd hitherto &s;o Unan&s;werable, none
of the Separate Traders, in their Nume|rous
Papers, having offer'd the lea&s;t &s;atis|factory
Reply to them, that there &s;eems
<PB N="44" REF="43">
no occa&s;ion to enlarge upon them. Only
here it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That in a &s;ettled Exclu&s;ive Company, all
the&s;e Objections are fairly An&s;wer'd; the
Difficulties of the other Trade are all Re|duced
here to a Certainty, and to a meer
Demon&s;tration. An E&s;tabli&s;t'd Company
under Privileges and Charters, are Enabled
by their very Con&s;titution, to bring all
the&s;e things to a Head.</P>
<P>They Engage to &s;upport the Factories
and Settlements; to Carry on the Trade,
whether Lo&s;s or Gain; to Defend and
Maintain the Forts and Ca&s;tles; and tho'
an Inverval of Trade, or Ce&s;&s;ation of Pro|fits
for a Year or Years, were to happen,
they go on; Depending on being better
Gainers heareafter; if Twenty Thou&s;and
Pound Lo&s;s falls at a time, they cannot be
Di&s;courag'd; the Trade is &s;ure to be kept
up till better Times return; the Forts and
Ca&s;tles, tho' Cut off from their Trade by
the In&s;urrections and Wars with the Na|tives,
receive their Con&s;tant Support and
Supply. This has been the Company's
Ca&s;e frequently, yet they have never A|bandon'd
the Settlements; whereas, had
Free Traders been left to have Supported
them, they had long ago been Lo&s;t and
For&s;aken.</P>
<P>The Company have often, in their
Schemes and Propo&s;als, offer'd, and they
now offer to give real and &s;ufficient Se|curity
to the Nation to pre&s;erve the Trade,
<PB N="45" REF="44">
by obliging them&s;elves in the Forfeiture of
their Charter, or &s;uch Penalties as the Go|vernment
&s;hall think rea&s;onable, to carry
on the Trade, &s;upport the Settlements, and
&s;upply the Colonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They have frequently offer'd to enter in|to
Stipulations, for Exporting Yearly, a
certain and very con&s;iderable Quantity of
Manufactures of the Growth and Produce
of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and to &s;upply the Plan|tations
with a certain Number of Negroes;
and not only &s;o, but to come to a Rea&s;on|able
Stated Price for the &s;aid Negroes, as
well in Times of War as Peace; that &s;o the
Colonies may not only be brought to a Cer|tainty,
as to the Number, but may be &s;ure
not to be Impo&s;ed upon in Price.</P>
<P>This very Part of their Propo&s;al &s;eems
a direct An&s;wer to Two Things, and after
what has been &s;aid, it &s;eems &s;omething
Wonderful to &s;ee them In&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P>1. The Pretence of a Monopoly: All
the Grievance of a Monopoly lies in the
Engro&s;&s;ers of a Trade, being in a Condition
to Impo&s;e a Price upon either Buyer or
Seller; which in this Ca&s;e is effectually
An&s;wer'd; for if they are bound to Export
a certain Quantity of Manufactures, they
are under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Buying, and &s;o
cannot Command the Price of the Seller.</P>
<P>If they are Ty'd to a Price of their
Negroes, they cannot Impo&s;e upon the
Market where they Sell; and &s;o all Pre|tence
of a Monopoly cea&s;es of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
And this &s;eems to make the Petitions
from the Merchants and Planters of the
Colonies the more unaccountably &s;trange;
for tho' it is True, that the &s;aid Petitions
are Sign'd by but few, and tho&s;e none of
the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable of either Merchants
or Planters; yet that any &s;hould be found
among tho&s;e who have an Intere&s;t in the
Colonies, who &s;hou'd be &s;o Weak thus to
Join in a Petition again&s;t them&s;elves, is
really one of the mo&s;t unaccountable things
in the World.</P>
<P>The Dearne&s;s of Negroes is their Grie|vance,
and the Uncertainty of their Sup|ply:
For them then to Petition again&s;t a
Company who offers Security to bring in
their Full Number, and at &s;uch Sea&s;ons as
they &s;hall propo&s;e, and to lower the Price
to &s;uch a Rea&s;onable Rate as they &s;hall a|gree
to; and this in Behalf of a Set of
Men, who have not only been already the
Occa&s;ion of their Scarcity, and of rai&s;ing
the Prices, but in who&s;e Schemes their
Supply, as well as the Price too, is &s;till left
Precarious and Uncertain.</P>
<P>This is indeed the greate&s;t Di&s;covery of
Infatuation that was ever &s;een in any thing
that bears the Title of a Merchant, and
makes it Edvident, that the power of Pre|judice
may &s;ometimes prevail upon Man|kind,
to blind their Eyes again&s;t their own
Intere&s;t, and make them <HI>Felo de&s;e</HI> in mat|ters
of Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">
But this is indeed be&s;t An&s;wered, by re|pre&s;enting
to the Members in Parliament,
that this Blindne&s;s is not a Judgment from
Heaven, upon the whole Body of the Plan|ters
and Merchants in the Colonies; but
on the contrary, the Company have an
Humble Petition from the greate&s;t Part and
the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable for Intere&s;t, of all the
Planters in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> to the Honour|able
Hou&s;e of Commons, humbly repre&s;ent|ing
the Nece&s;&s;ity of E&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;aid
Trade in an Exclu&s;ive Company, under &s;uch
Limitations as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, as being
the only way to &s;ecure and pre&s;erve the &s;aid
Trade to the Nation, and to reduce the Ex|orbitant
Rates of Negroes in the Colonies,
which is now impo&s;ed upon them by the
Separate Traders.</P>
<P>By all which Arguments it &s;eems beyond
Contradiction, that the only way to &s;ecure
and pre&s;erve this Beneficial Trade to this
Nation, is to &s;ettle it upon a firm Founda|tion,
in a Company with Exclu&s;ive Privi|ledges,
and yet to have tho&s;e Exclu&s;ive
Priviledges under &s;uch Limitations and Re|gulations
as may remove all the Scandal
and Sugge&s;tions of Monopolies, Engro&s;&s;|&s;ings
and Unfair Trading; that the Trade
may be once more re&s;tor'd to its former
flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances, and both the
Nation at home and the Colonies abroad,
may be made Ea&s;y and be Gainers by the
Trade, which can never be as it now &s;tands.</P>
