<P>'TIS not &s;o much the Itch of being thought an Au|thor,
nor of following, the Method of tho&s;e Wri|ters,
whether Originals, or Tran&s;lators, (e&s;pecially
the la&s;t) who think Prefacing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; that, rather
than forego their Opinion, they will &s;poil a good Work for
the &s;ake of a Half-Sheet of their own Scribbling, that in|duces
me to attempt one in this Place: If I had had no par|ticular
Advantage in &s;o doing, I mu&s;t, without Flattery,
inform you, that I had wav'd the Trouble: But &s;ince 'twas
nece&s;&s;ary, pray take it and make the be&s;t on't. And now all
I have to &s;ay, is to make the&s;e Pages have a good Run;
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
which I cannot pretend to do, by any Elogy on 'em; but
refer you to the Peru&s;al. It has indeed Two of the
Be&s;t Recommendations Book can have, at this Time; It
is like our Fa&s;hions, FRENCH. (And as the <HI>Gal|lican</HI>
Mode, tho' never &s;o ridiculou&s;ly adju&s;ted upon an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Per&s;on, meets not only with Reception, but Encou|ragement,
I'm in great Hopes the very Place of this Pam|phlet's
Birth, will hide the Blunders of the Ver&s;ion.) And
then 'tis again&s;t the JESUITES. If with the&s;e
Two Qualities it &s;hould not meet Acceptation, I &s;hall be
apt to think <HI>Diogenes,</HI> who would be bury'd with his
Face downwards, that when the World turn'd up&s;ide|down,
(which in his Days he expected) he might lye right
in his Grave, has now got his Wi&s;h; and, by the Ill-vent
of this Commodity, judge, that all the BEAUX,

<HEAD>A CURIOUS
Little Oration,

<P>_IT was one <HI>Lent,</HI> and about the
Time that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnaud,</HI> had
his Famous Di&s;putes with the
JESUITES; I mean, when
JANSENISM was at the greate&s;t
height (a Fantome which the jealous Cunning
of tho&s;e good Fathers knew how to improve
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to the Detriment and Pro&s;ecution of many
better <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) that <HI>Little Father ANDREW,</HI>
&s;o famous for his <HI>Witty Jokes,</HI> preach'd at
<HI>Alby.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Cu&s;tom, this LITTLE
Good Man, on the <HI>Samaritan</HI>'s Day, did not
fail to make a Di&s;cour&s;e on Grace, and what
was more, upon Efficacious Grace by it &s;elf:
And &s;olidly proved from St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI>'s Princi|ples,
That no one ever re&s;i&s;ted that Grace; not
but that Men can, but will not; for its Attri|bute
is ju&s;t to in&s;pire what we will not oppugn.
He added, That &s;ufficient Grace was a New
Sy&s;tem, broach'd by the JESUIT. <HI>Molina,</HI>
to reconcile the pretended Contradictions of
its Omnipotent Power with Freewill. In
&s;hort, he a&s;&s;erted <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;m</HI> to the la&s;t De|gree.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Society who were pre&s;ent
at this Sermon, being nettled to hear <HI>Molina</HI>'s
Reverend School u&s;ed at this Rate, took it
(as you may well &s;uppo&s;e) in great Dudgeon,
and re&s;olved to load the Poor Preacher with
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the heavy Weight of their Holy and Implaca|ble
Fury. They extracted &s;everal Tenets,
which, in their Opinion, contain'd the mo&s;t
poi&s;onous Venom of Here&s;y, pack'd away to
the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Alby</HI>; and, giving the Con|tents
into his Hand, <HI>Is it not an Errant Shame,</HI>
(&s;ay they, with a Zeal animated not for the
Glory of God, but of the Society) <HI>Is it not a
Shame, my Lord, That this Little Whisk of a
Monk &s;hall come hither to preach <HI>JANSENISM</HI>
Tooth and Nail; whil&s;t the Pope, Bi&s;hops,
Kings, Magi&s;trates, and, indeed, all Powers,
as well Eccle&s;ia&s;tick as Secular, are endeavouring
to root this Cockle out of the Field of the
<HI>CHURCH.</HI></HI></P>
<P>THE Archbi&s;hop, who knew by Expe|rience
how nece&s;&s;ary their Good-Will was, at
that Time, to the making of a Man's Fortune;
and, on the contrary, the Danger as well as
Inconveniency of being hated by them; the
Archbi&s;hop, I &s;ay, came into their Re&s;ent|ments,
and promi&s;ed them condign and &s;pee|dy
Satisfaction. He cited <HI>Little Father AN|DREW,</HI>
and &s;harply rebuked him, for ha|ving
<PB N="8" REF="7">
preach'd up Here&s;y, not without terrible
Threats, of inflicting on him the Puni&s;hments
ordain'd in &s;uch Ca&s;es by the Canons of the
Church.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Little</HI> Prie&s;t, who was too well ac|quainted
with the JESUITES not to know
that they were not to be offended with Impu|nity;
and that whoever offered to contradict
their Notions, was at lea&s;t a Heretick, gave a
&s;hrewd Gue&s;s at what was coming; and there|fore
was not mightily di&s;may'd at the Bi&s;hop's
thundering Reprimand; but, with a becoming
Pre&s;ence of Mind, made this An&s;wer; <HI>God
pre&s;erve me, my Lord, from Preaching Here&s;y
I can a&s;&s;ure you I never had the lea&s;t Intention to
deviate from the Sentiments of the <HI>Catholick
Church</HI>; &s;ome unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions may per|haps,
in the Heat of Di&s;cour&s;e, have fallenn
from me; which, having met with an Evil
Con&s;truction, have given Room for the Accu&s;a|tion
now intended again&s;t me. Therefore, be
plea&s;ed, my Lord, to let me know what Here|tical
Propo&s;itions I am charg'd with advancing,
that I may confront them with my <HI>SER|MON</HI>,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>which contains no &s;uch Matters; and
if I have &s;aid any Thing that is not Orthodox,
I will retract it next <HI>Sunday</HI>; and, by my Re|cantation,
undeceive tho&s;e whom I have &s;canda|liz'd
by my Imprudence.</HI></P>
<P>THE Archbi&s;hop, &s;atisfied with this Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
of the <HI>Little</HI> FATHER, deliver'd to him
the Paper which contain'd &s;uch of his Propo|&s;itions
as were condemn'd by the JESUITES;
and gave tho&s;e <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s (as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>French</HI> Burle&s;que Author.</NOTE><HI>Guy Patin</HI>
calls them) an Account of what had pa&s;&s;ed;
who for once were out in their Politicks,
and &s;ung <HI>Io Paean</HI> before the Victory; loud|ly
publi&s;hing, through the Town, the intended
Recantation of <HI>Little Father ANDREW.</HI>
They cloy'd them&s;elves beforehand, with the
mighty Plea&s;ure they were to receive, from
the great Shame which they pretended he
would be obliged, at that Time, to un|dergo.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
HEAVEN knows there was no want of them
at <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Sermon; and they had taken
&s;pecial Care to invite all their Parti&s;ans, and
to place them&s;elves over again&s;t the Preacher,
that they might more fully rejoice at his
Confu&s;ion. They that knew the LITTLE
Father better, did not doubt of finding this
Sermon curiou&s;ly intermix'd with Scenes of
Mirth: So that with tho&s;e who were of the
<HI>Je&s;uitical</HI> Faction, and tho&s;e who came to the
unravelling of the LITTLE Gentleman's late
Di&s;cour&s;e, there was a very numerous Audience.</P>
