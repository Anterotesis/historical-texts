<P>WE are indebted to Heaven for all things, and above all for our &s;en&s;e and genius (in what|ever
<PB N="8" REF="6">
degree we have it); but to fan|cy your&s;elf indebted to any thing el&s;e, moves my anger at your mode&s;ty. The regard I mu&s;t bear you, &s;eriou&s;ly pro|ceeds from my&s;elf alone; and I will not &s;uffer even one I like &s;o much as Mrs. H. to have a &s;hare in cau&s;ing it. I challenge a kind of relation to you on the <HI>&s;oul's</HI> &s;ide, which I take to be better than either on a father's or mother's; and if you can overlook an ugly <HI>body</HI> (that &s;tands much in the way of any friend&s;hip, when it is be|tween different &s;exes) I &s;hall hope to find you a true and con&s;tant kin&s;wo|man
<PB N="9" REF="7">
in Apollo. Not that I would place all my preten&s;ions upon that poetical foot, much le&s;s confine them to it; I am far more de&s;irous to be admitted as yours, on the more meri|torious title of friend&s;hip. I have ever believed this as a &s;acred maxim, that the mo&s;t ingenious natures were the mo&s;t &s;incere; and the mo&s;t knowing and &s;en&s;ible minds made the be&s;t friends. Of all tho&s;e that I have thought it the felicity of my life to know, I have ever found the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in capacity, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in morality: and tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="8">
the mo&s;t to be depended on, whom one e&s;teemed &s;o much as to de&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;o. I beg you to make me no more compliments. I could make you a great many, but I know you neithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> need them, nor can like them: be &s;o good as to think I do not. In one word, your writings are very good, and very entertaining; but not &s;o good, nor &s;o entertaining, as your life and conver&s;ation. One is but the effect and emanation of the other. It will always be a greater plea&s;ure to me, to know you are well, than that you write well, though every time
<PB N="11" REF="9">
you tell me the one, I mu&s;t know the other. I am willing to &s;pare your mode&s;ty; and therefore, as to your writing, may perhaps never &s;ay more (directly to your&s;elf) than the few ver|&s;es I &s;end here; which (as a proof of my own mode&s;ty too) I made &s;o long ago as the day you &s;ate for your picture, and yet never till now dur&s;t confe&s;s to you.</P>

<P>THOUGH I am extremely obliged by your agreeable let|ter, I will avoid all mention of the plea&s;ure you give me, that we may have no more words about compli|ments; which I have often ob&s;erved people talk them&s;elves into, while
<PB N="14" REF="12">
they endeavour to talk them&s;elves out of. It is no more the diet of friend|&s;hip and e&s;teem, than a few thin wa|fers and marmalade were of &s;o hearty a &s;tomach as Sancho's. In a word, I am very proud of my new relation, and like Parna&s;&s;us much the better, &s;ince I found I had &s;o good a neight|bour there. Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who lives at court, &s;hall teach two country-folks &s;incerity; and when I am &s;o happy as to meet you, &s;he &s;hall &s;ettle the proportions of that regard, or good|nature, which &s;he can allow you to &s;pare me, from a heart, which is &s;o much her own as yours is.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">
THAT lady is the mo&s;t tru&s;ty of friends, if the imitation of Shake&s;pear be yours; for &s;he made me give my opinion of it with a&s;&s;urance it was none of Mrs <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. I hone&s;tly liked and prai&s;ed it, who&s;e-&s;oever it was; there is in it a &s;en&s;ible melancholy, and too true a picture of human life; &s;o true an one, that I can &s;carce wi&s;h the ver&s;es yours at the expence of your thinking that way, &s;o early. I rather wi&s;h you may love the town (which the author of tho&s;e lines can|not <HI>immoderately</HI> do) the&s;e many years.
<PB N="16" REF="14">
It is time enough to like, or affect to like, the country, when one is out of love with all but one's-&s;elf, and therefore &s;tudies to become agreeable or ea&s;y to one's-&s;elf. Retiring into one's-&s;elf is generally the <HI>pis-aller</HI> of mankind. Would you have me de&s;cribe my &s;o|litude and grotto to you? what if, after a long and painted de&s;cription of them in ver&s;e (which the writer I have ju&s;t been &s;peaking of could better make, if I can gue&s;s by that line,
<Q><L>No noi&s;e but water, ever friend to thought)</L></Q>
<PB N="17" REF="15">
what if it ended thus?</P>
<LG>
<L>What are the falling rills, the pendant &s;hades,</L>
<L>The morning bow'rs, the evening colonnades;</L>
<L>But &s;oft rece&s;&s;es for th' unea&s;y mind,</L>
<L>To &s;igh un-heard in, to the pa&s;&s;ing wind!</L>
<L>Lo! the &s;truck deer, in &s;ome &s;eque&s;ter'd part,</L>

<L>There hid in &s;hades, and wa&s;ting day by day,</L>
<L>Inly he bleeds, and pants his &s;oul away.</L>
</LG>
<P>If the&s;e lines want poetry, they do not want &s;en&s;e. God Almighty long pre&s;erve you from a feeling of them! The book you mention, Bruyere's Characters, will make any one know the world; and I believe at the &s;ame
<PB N="18" REF="16">
time de&s;pi&s;e it (which is a &s;ign it will make one know it thoroughly). It is certainly the proof of a ma&s;ter-hand, that can give &s;uch &s;triking likene&s;&s;es, in &s;uch &s;light &s;ketches, and in &s;o few &s;trokes on each &s;ubject. In an&s;wer to your que&s;tion about Shake&s;pear, the book is about a quarter printed, and the number of emendations very great. I have never indulged my own con|jectures, but kept meerly to &s;uch amendments as are authorized by old editions, in the author's life-time: but I think it will be a year at lea&s;t before the whole work can be fini&s;h|ed.

In reply to your very hand&s;ome (I wi&s;h it were a very true) compliment upon this head, I only de&s;ire you to ob&s;erve, by what natural, gentle de|grees I have &s;unk to the humble thing I now am: fir&s;t from a pretending poet to a critick, then to a low tran|&s;lator, la&s;tly to a meer publi&s;her.

<P>I COULD not play the imperti|nent &s;o far as to write to you, till I was encouraged to it by a piece of news Mrs H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> tells me, which ought to be the mo&s;t agreeable in the world to any author, That you are determined to write no more&mdash;It is now the time then, not for me only,
<PB N="24" REF="22">
but for every body, to write without fear, or wit: and I &s;hall give you the fir&s;t example here. But for this a&s;&s;u|rance, it would be every way too dan|gerous to corre&s;pond with a lady, who&s;e very fir&s;t &s;ight and very fir&s;t writings had &s;uch an effect, upon a man u&s;ed to what they call fine &s;ights, and what they call fine writings. Yet he has been dull enough to &s;leep qui|etly, after all he has &s;een, and all he has read; till yours broke in upon his &s;tupidity and indolence, and totally de&s;troyed it. But, God be thanked, you will write no more; &s;o I am in
<PB N="25" REF="23">
no danger of increa&s;ing my admira|tion of you one way; and as to the other, you will never (I have too much rea&s;on to fear) open the&s;e eyes again with one glimp&s;e of you.</P>
<P>I AM told, you named lately in a letter a place called Twitenham, with particular di&s;tinction. That you may not be mi&s;-con&s;trued and have your meaning mi&s;taken for the future, I mu&s;t acquaint you, Madam, that the name of the place where Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> is, is not Twitenham, but Rich|mond; which your ignorance in the

geography of the&s;e parts has made you confound together. You will unthinkingly do honour to a paltry hermitage (while you &s;peak of Twi|tenham) where lives a creature alto|gether unworthy your memory or notice, becau&s;e he really wi&s;hes he had never beheld you, nor yours. You have &s;poiled him for a &s;olitaire, and a book, all the days of his life; and put him into &s;uch a condition, that he thinks of nothing, and en|quires of nothing but after a per&s;on who has nothing to &s;ay to him, and has left him for ever without hope of

ever again regarding, or plea&s;ing, or entertaining him, much le&s;s of &s;eeing him. He has been &s;o mad with the idea of her, as to &s;teal her picture, and pa&s;&s;es whole days in &s;itting before it, talking to him&s;elf, and (as &s;ome people imagine) making ver&s;es; but it is no &s;uch matter, for as long as he can get any of hers, he can never turn his head to his own, it is &s;o much better entertained.</P>

<P>I AM touched with &s;hame when I look on the date of your letter. I have an&s;wered it a hundred times in my own mind, which I a&s;&s;ure you has few thoughts, either &s;o frequent or &s;o lively, as tho&s;e relating to you.

upon the lo&s;s of a friend. It is like the &s;hower we have had this morning, that ju&s;t makes the drooping trees hold up their heads, but they remain checked and withered at the root: the benediction is but a &s;hort relief, though it comes from Heaven it&s;elf. The lo&s;s of a friend is the lo&s;s of life; after that is gone from us, it is all but a gentler decay, and wa&s;ting and lingering a little longer. I was the other day forming a wi&s;h for a lady's happine&s;s, upon her birth-day: and thinking of the greate&s;t climax of fe|licity I could rai&s;e, &s;tep by &s;tep, to

<P>YOUR la&s;t letter tells me, that if I do not write in le&s;s than a month, you will fancy the length of yours frighted me. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had upon me of omitting too long to an&s;wer it, made me look (not without &s;ome fear and trembling) for
<PB N="34" REF="32">
the date of it: but there happened to be none; and I hope, either that you have forgot how long it is, or at lea&s;t that you cannot think it &s;o long as I do, &s;ince I writ to you. Indeed a multitude of things (which &s;ingly &s;eem trifles, and yet altogether make a va&s;t deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, and wholly take up that time which we ought to value above all &s;uch things) have from day to day made me wanting, as well to my own greate&s;t plea&s;ure in this, as to my own greate&s;t concerns in other points. If I &s;eem to neglect any friend I have, I do more than &s;eem to
<PB N="35" REF="33">
neglect my&s;elf, as I find daily by the increa&s;ing ill con&s;titution of my body and mind. I &s;till re&s;olve this cour&s;e &s;hall not, nay I &s;ee it cannot, be long; and I determine to retreat within my&s;elf to the only bu&s;ine&s;s I was born for, and which I am only good for (if I am entitled to u&s;e that phra&s;e for any thing). It is great folly to &s;a|crifice one's &s;elf, one's time, one's quiet (the very life of life it&s;elf), to forms, complai&s;ances, and amu&s;e|ments, which do not inwardly plea&s;e me, and only plea&s;e a &s;ort of people who regard me no farther than a
<PB N="36" REF="34">
meer in&s;trument of their pre&s;ent idle|ne&s;s, or vanity. To &s;ay truth, the lives of tho&s;e we call great and happy are divided between tho&s;e two &s;tates; and in each of them, we poetical fid|lers make but part of their plea&s;ure, or of their equipage. And the mi|&s;ery is, we, in our turns, are &s;o vain (at lea&s;t I have been &s;o) as to chu&s;e to pipe without being paid, and &s;o &s;illy to be plea&s;ed with piping to tho&s;e who under&s;tand mu&s;ick le&s;s than our&s;elves. They have put me of late upon a ta&s;k before I was aware, which I am <HI>&s;ick</HI> and <HI>&s;ore</HI> of: and yet enga|ged
<PB N="37" REF="35">
in honour to &s;ome per&s;ons whom I mu&s;t neither di&s;obey nor di&s;appoint (I mean two or three in the world only) to go on with it. They make me do as mean a thing as the greate&s;t man of them could do; &s;eem to de|pend, and to &s;olicit, when I do not want; and make a kind of court to tho&s;e above my rank, ju&s;t as they do to tho&s;e above theirs, when we might much more wi&s;ely and agreeably live of our&s;elves, and to our&s;elves. You will ea&s;ily find I am talking of my tran&s;lating the Ody&s;&s;ey by &s;ub&s;crip|tion: which looks, it mu&s;t needs
<PB N="38" REF="36">
look, to all the world as a de&s;ign of mine both upon fame and money, when in truth I believe I &s;hall get neither; for one I go about without any &s;tomach, and the other I &s;hall not go about at all.</P>
<P>THIS freedom of opening my mind upon my own &s;ituation will be a proof of tru&s;t, and of an opinion your goodne&s;s of nature has made me entertain, that you never profe&s;s any degree of good-will without being pretty warm in it. So I tell you my grievances; I hope in God you have
<PB N="39" REF="37">
none, wherewith to make me any return of this kind. I hope that was the only one which you commu|nicated in your la&s;t, about Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;ilence; for which &s;he want|ed not reproaches from me; and has &s;ince, &s;he &s;ays, amply atoned for.

<P>I DO not know, on the other hand, what you can think of me; but this, for a beginning, I will venture to en|gage, that whoever takes me for a poet, or a wit (as they call it), takes me for a creature of le&s;s value than I am: and that where-ever I profe&s;s it, you &s;hall find me a much better man, that is, a much better friend, or at lea&s;t a much le&s;s faulty one, than I

I would, with as much readine&s;s, play the apothecary or the nur&s;e, to mend your head-akes, as I would play the critick to improve your ver&s;es.

I can mend them very little, and only in trifles, not worth writing about; but will tell you every tittle when I have the happine&s;s to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>I AM more concerned than you can rea&s;onably believe, for the ill &s;tate of health you are at pre&s;ent under: but I will appeal to time, to &s;hew you how &s;incerely I am (if I live long enough to prove my&s;elf what I truly am)</P>

<P>IT happened that when I deter|mined to an&s;wer yours, by the po&s;t that followed my receipt of it, I was prevented from the fir&s;t proof I have had the happine&s;s to give you of my warmth and readine&s;s, in re|turning
<PB N="50" REF="48">
the epitaph, with my &s;incere condolements with you on that me|lancholy &s;ubject. But neverthele&s;s I re&s;olved to &s;end you the one, though unattended by the other: I begged Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to inclo&s;e it, that you might at lea&s;t &s;ee I had not the power to delay a moment the do|ing what you bid me; e&s;pecial|ly when the occa&s;ion of obeying your commands was &s;uch, as mu&s;t affect every admirer and well-wi&s;h|er of honour and virtue in the na|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="49">
YOU had it in the very blots, the better to compare the places; and I can only &s;ay it was done to the be&s;t of my judgement, and to the extent of my &s;incerity.</P>
<P>I DO not wonder that you decline the poetical amu&s;ement I propo&s;ed to you, at this time. I know (from what little I know of your heart) enough at lea&s;t to convince me, it mu&s;t be too deeply concerned at the lo&s;s, not only of &s;o great, and &s;o near a relation; but of a good man (a lo&s;s
<PB N="52" REF="50">
this age can hardly ever afford to bear, and not often can &s;u&s;tain). Yet perhaps it is one of the be&s;t things that can be &s;aid of poetry, that it helps us to pa&s;s over the toils and troubles of this tire&s;ome journey, our life; as hor&s;es are encouraged and &s;pirited up, the better to bear their labour, by the jingling of bells about their heads. Indeed, as to my&s;elf, I have been u&s;ed to this odd cordial, &s;o long, that it has no effect upon me: but you, Madam, are in your honey|moon of poetry; you have &s;een only the &s;miles, and enjoyed the care&s;&s;es,
<PB N="53" REF="51">
of Apollo. Nothing is &s;o plea&s;ant to a Mu&s;e as the fir&s;t children of the imagination; but when once &s;he comes to find it meer conjugal duty, and the care of her numerous progeny daily grows upon her, it is all a &s;our tax for pa&s;t plea&s;ure. As the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays on another occa&s;ion, the age of a Mu&s;e is &s;carce above five and twen|ty: all the re&s;t is labour and &s;orrow. I find by experience that his own fiddle is no great plea&s;ure to a com|mon fidler, after once the fir&s;t good conceit of him&s;elf is lo&s;t.</P>

<P>AFTER a very long expecta|tion and daily hopes of the &s;a|tisfaction of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with you, I am &s;till deprived of it in a manner that is the mo&s;t afflicting, becau&s;e it is occa&s;ioned by your ill|ne&s;s
<PB N="60" REF="58">
and your misfortune. I can bear my own, I a&s;&s;ure you, much better: and thus to find you lo&s;t to me, at the time that I hoped to have regained you, doubles the concern I &s;hould naturally feel in being de|prived of any plea&s;ure whatever.</P>
<P>MRS. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> can be&s;t expre&s;s to you the concern of a friend, who e&s;teems and pities: for &s;he has the liberty to expre&s;s it in her actions, and the &s;atisfaction of attending on you in your indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="59">
I WISH &s;incerely your condition were not &s;uch as to debar me from telling you in per&s;on how truly I am yours. I wi&s;h I could do you any little offices of friend&s;hip, or give you any amu&s;ements, or help you to what people in your pre&s;ent &s;tate mo&s;t want, better &s;pirits. If reading to you, or writing to you, could contribute to entertain your hours, or to rai&s;e you to a livelier reli&s;h of life, how well &s;hould I think my time employed! indeed I &s;hould, and think it a much better end of my poor &s;tudies, than
<PB N="62" REF="60">
all the vanities of fame, or views of a character that way, which engage mo&s;t men of my fraternity.</P>
<P>IF you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I am your &s;ervant, you would take &s;ome notice of the ad|vice I would give you, and &s;uffer it to have a weight with you propor|tionable to the &s;incerity with which it is given.</P>
<P>I BEG you to do your utmo&s;t to call to you all the &s;uccours, which
<PB N="63" REF="61">
your own good &s;en&s;e and natural re|flexion can &s;ugge&s;t, to avoid a melan|choly way of thinking, and to throw up your &s;pirits by intervals of mode|rate company; not to let your di&s;tem|per fix it&s;elf upon your mind at lea&s;t, though it will not entirely quit your body. Do not indulge too much &s;olitarine&s;s. Though mo&s;t company be not proper or &s;upportable during your illne&s;s, force your&s;elf to enter into &s;uch as is good and rea&s;onable, where you may have your liberty, and be under no re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="62">
WHY will you not come to your friend Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &s;ince you are able to go out, and &s;ince motion is certainly good for your health? why will you not make any little &s;ets of &s;uch as you are ea&s;ie&s;t with, to &s;it with you &s;ometimes?</P>
<P>Do not think I have any intere&s;ted aim in this advice: though I long to &s;ee you, and to try to amu&s;e you, I would not for the world be con&s;i|dered as one that would ever require

for my own gratification, any thing that might either be improper or hurtful to you.</P>
<P>PRAY let me know, by our friend Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, if there can be any thing in my power to &s;erve, or to amu&s;e you. But u&s;e me &s;o kindly, as not to think ever of writing to me till you are &s;o well as that I may &s;ee you, and then it will be need|le&s;s.

<P>IT was an inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to me to &s;ee your letter, as I a&s;&s;ure you it had long been a great trouble, to reflect on the melancholy rea&s;on of your &s;ilence and ab&s;ence. It was
<PB N="68" REF="66">
that only which hindered my wri|ting, not only again, but often, to you; for fear your good-nature &s;hould have been prompted to oblige me too much at your own expence, by an&s;wering. Indeed I never ex|pre&s;&s;ed (and never &s;hall be able to expre&s;s) more concern and good wi&s;h|es for you, than I &s;hall ever feel for one of your merit.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry, the moment you grow better, to have you &s;natcht from tho&s;e, who I may &s;ay de&s;erve the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing you in health, for

<P>MRS. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, I hope, will find it not impo&s;&s;ible to draw you to Richmond: and if not, I dare &s;ay will not be long out of Hertford&s;hire. I want nothing but the &s;ame happy pretence &s;he has, of a title through your friend&s;hip, and the privilege of her &s;ex, to be there immediately. I cannot but wonder you have not heard from her, though I &s;hould wonder if any body el&s;e had; for I am told by her family &s;he has had
<PB N="70" REF="68">
much of the head-ake at Bath, be|&s;ides the excu&s;e of a great giddine&s;s occa&s;ioned naturally by the waters. I writ to her at the fir&s;t going, and have not had a word from her; and now you tell me the &s;ame thing, I conclude &s;he has been wor&s;e than I imagined. I hear &s;he returns on Wedne&s;day, when I &s;hall have the &s;a|tisfaction (I doubt not) to talk and hear a great deal of Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>I WISH I could &s;ay any thing, ei|ther to comfort you when ill, or en|tertain
<PB N="71" REF="69">
you when well. Though nothing could, in the proper propor|tion of friend&s;hip, more affect me than your condition; I have not wanted other occa&s;ions of great melancholy, of which the lea&s;t is the lo&s;s of part of my fortune by a late act of parlia|ment.</P>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent in the afflicting circum&s;tance of taking my la&s;t leave of one of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Atterbury.</NOTE> true&s;t friends I ever had, and one of the greate&s;t men in all polite learning, as well as the mo&s;t

<P>I REALLY do not love life &s;o dear|ly, or &s;o weakly, as to value it on any other &s;core, than for that portion of happine&s;s which a friend only can be|&s;tow upon it: or, if I mu&s;t want that my&s;elf, for the plea&s;ure which is next it, of &s;eeing de&s;erving and virtuous people happy. So that indeed I want comfort; and the greate&s;t I can re|ceive from you (at lea&s;t unle&s;s I were &s;o happy as to de&s;erve what I never can) will be to hear you grow better

<P>IT would be a vanity in me to tell you why I trouble you &s;o &s;oon again: I cannot imagine my&s;elf of the number of tho&s;e corre&s;pondents whom you call favourite ones; yet I
<PB N="75" REF="73">

In good earne&s;t, I am more ambitious of being &s;o to you, Madam, than I ever was, or ever &s;hall be, of being one to any Prince, or (which is more) any Prince's Mini&s;ter, in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="74">
I WISH I could tell you any agreea|ble news of what your heart is con|cerned in; but I have a &s;ort of quar|rel to Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> for not loving her&s;elf &s;o well as &s;he does her friends: for tho&s;e &s;he makes happy, but not her&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is an air of &s;adne&s;s about her which grieves me, and which, I have learnt by experience, will increa&s;e upon an indolent (I will not &s;ay an affected) re&s;ignation to it.
<PB N="77" REF="75">
It will do &s;o in men, and much more in women, who have a natural &s;oft|ne&s;s that &s;inks them even when rea|&s;on does not. This I tell you in con|fidence; and pray give our friend &s;uch hints as may put her out of hu|mour with melancholy: your cen|&s;ure, or even your raillery, may have more weight with her than mine: a man cannot either &s;o de|cently, or &s;o delicately, take upon him to be a phy&s;ician in the&s;e con|cealed di&s;tempers.</P>

YOU &s;ee, Madam, I proceed in tru&s;ting you with things that nearly concern me. In my la&s;t letter I &s;poke but of a trifle, my&s;elf: in this I ad|vance farther, and &s;peak of what touches me more, a friend.</P>
<P>THIS beautiful &s;ea&s;on will rai&s;e up &s;o many rural images and de&s;criptions in a poetical mind, that I expect, you, and all &s;uch as you (if there be any &s;uch), at lea&s;t all who are not down|right dull tran&s;lators, like your &s;er|vant,

could wi&s;h you tried &s;omething in the de&s;criptive way on any &s;ubject you plea&s;e, mixed with vi&s;ion and moral; like pieces of the old proven&ccedil;al poets, which abound with fancy, and are the mo&s;t amu&s;ing &s;cenes in nature. There are three or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable: <Q REND="inline">"the Flower and the Leaf"</Q> every body has been delighted with.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="79">
I HAVE long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale, the more wild and exotic the better; therefore a <HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> which is confined to no rules of pro|bability, will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of de&s;cription you will; provided there be an apparent moral to it. I think, one or two of the Per&s;ian tales would give one hints for &s;uch an invention: and perhaps if the &s;cenes were taken from real places that are known, in order to compliment particular gardens and buildings of a fine ta&s;te (as I believe
<PB N="82" REF="80">
&s;everal of Chaucer's de&s;criptions do, though it is what nobody has ob|&s;erved), it would add great beauty to the whole.</P>
<P>I WISH you found &s;uch an amu&s;e|ment plea&s;ing to you: if you did but, at lei&s;ure, form de&s;criptions from ob|jects in nature it&s;elf, which &s;truck you mo&s;t livelily, I would undertake to find a tale that &s;hould bring them all together: which you will think an odd undertaking, but in a piece of this fanciful and imaginary nature I
