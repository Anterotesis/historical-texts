<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE great Honour Your Maje&s;ty has done me, in giving me leave to prefix Your Royal Name to the following Poems, does not encourage me to pre&s;ume they are worthy to be laid at Your Feet on any other account, but only as they are an hum|ble
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Tribute of Duty, offer'd from a thankful Heart to a gracious Benefactre&s;s. Your Ma|je&s;ty has indeed the &s;ame Right to them, as You have to the Fruits of a Tree, which You have tran&s;planted out of a barren Soil into a fertile and beautiful Garden. It was Your Genero&s;ity which brought me out of Ob&s;cu|rity, and &s;till conde&s;cends to protect me; like the Supreme Being, who continually &s;up|ports the meane&s;t Creature, which his Good|ne&s;s has produc'd.</P>
<P>I have Room here to expatiate upon a very inviting Subject; but Your Maje&s;ty has nobly prevented all Panegyric, even from the be&s;t Pens, by building Your <HI>Fame</HI> on a much more la&s;ting Ba&s;is, than that of <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> in <HI>Dedications.</HI> Your Encouragements of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> Your E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip for all Defenders of Truth, while they are living,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
the Regard You pay to their Memories when dead, and Your generous Care of their Wi|dows and Orphans, record Your Virtues in &s;uch Characters as will ever be legible. Your Chri&s;tian Love to Mankind, Your zealous Endeavours to promote <HI>Religion,</HI> a Soul made tender to feel our Misfortunes, and a Will inclin'd to redre&s;s them, are &s;uch ami|able and heavenly Qualities, as &s;hine be&s;t by their own Light, and can receive no new Lu&s;tre from the fine&s;t De&s;cription.</P>
<P>MAY Heaven long pre&s;erve Your Maje&s;ty to practi&s;e all the&s;e Virtues, to be a perpetual Source of Comfort and Joy to our glorious Monarch, a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Nation, and a noble Pattern of Beneficence and Genero&s;ity to future Queens. Your Maje&s;ty's great Goodne&s;s to my&s;elf draws this Prayer from a Heart fill'd with Gratitude. As there is &s;o
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
little Merit in what You now honour with Your Royal Protection, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply the Defects, the only way that is in my Power, by my Thanks, and Prayers for Your Maje&s;ty: <HI>The&s;e</HI> I will ever continue, and always make it my greate&s;t Ambition to &s;hew with what profound Re&s;pect I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WHAT I propo&s;e in this Preface, is only to be&s;peak the Reader's Good-nature, and to &s;ay &s;ome|thing which may incline him to pardon what he cannot com|mend. I have indeed but a poor Defence to make for the Things I have wrote: I don't think them good, and better Judges will doubtle&s;s think wor&s;e of them than I do. Only this, I believe, I may &s;ay of them, That, if they have nothing to delight tho&s;e who may
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
chance to read them, they have nothing to give Mode&s;ty a Blu&s;h; if nothing to entertain and improve the Mind, they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Motive, that I hope may in|duce the Reader to overlook the Defects in this Volume, is, That the olde&s;t Poem in it is little more than &s;ix Years of Age; and a con&s;iderable Part of the Time &s;ince that was writ, has been &s;pent in endeavouring to learn a Language, of which I was then intirely ignorant; tho' I fear, the few Attempts I have made in Tran&s;lations, will too well convince the Public, to how little Purpo&s;e I have employ'd my Time. I confe&s;s my&s;elf guilty of a great Pre&s;umption in publi&s;h|ing Imitations of <HI>HORACE,</HI> when many eminent Hands have done it much better before me: But when I was only endeavouring to under&s;tand him, I found it difficult to conquer a Temptation I had to imitate &s;ome of his Thoughts, which mightily pleas'd me. If I may be forgiven this Experiment, I promi&s;e to trouble the World with nothing of this Nature again, at lea&s;t, till I may be able to do my Author more Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8">
I have not my&s;elf been &s;o fond of writing, as might be imagin'd from &s;eeing &s;o many Things of mine as are got together in this Book. Se|veral of them are on Subjects that were given me by Per&s;ons, to whom I have &s;uch great Ob|ligations, that I always thought their De&s;ires Commands. My want of <HI>Education</HI> will be too evident from them, for me to mention it here: And I hope, when the Reader weighs my Performances, he will put <HI>that,</HI> and other Di&s;advantages into the Scale.</P>
<P>I am afraid, the Letter relating to my&s;elf, wrote by a worthy and learned Gentleman, will be thought an improper Thing in a Publication made by my&s;elf: But, as I was de&s;ir'd to prefix it, by Per&s;ons whom I think it an Honour to obey, I hope it will be pardon'd; and the rather, becau&s;e a very fal&s;e Account had been publi&s;h'd before, by a Per&s;on who &s;eems to have had as little Regard for Truth, as he had for Hone&s;ty, when he &s;tole my Poems.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">
I would willingly here make known my Obli|gations to tho&s;e worthy Per&s;ons who fir&s;t took notice of me in the mid&s;t of <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>La|bour,</HI> were I not afraid, my Gratitude, thus publicly expre&s;s'd, would offend them more than my Silence. However, I mu&s;t beg leave to re|turn my Thanks to a Reverend Gentleman of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and to another of <HI>Winche&s;ter:</HI> The former made my Life more comfortable, as &s;oon as he knew me; the latter, after giving me &s;everal Te&s;timonies of his Bounty and Good|ne&s;s, pre&s;ented my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays to a Lady of Quality, attending on the Queen, who made my low Circum&s;tances known to Her <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>I hope too, that all tho&s;e Honourable Per|&s;ons, who&s;e <HI>Names</HI> do me &s;o much Credit at the Beginning of my Book, will accept my Ac|knowledgments and Thanks for &s;o liberal a Sub&s;cription: And as this Volume, I fear, will tell them, they have not encourag'd a Poet, I will endeavour to let them &s;ee they have been generous to an hone&s;t Man.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR, In a LETTER to a FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Written in the Year <DATE>1730.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Don't wonder that you &s;hould de&s;ire &s;o di&s;tinct an Account, how <HI>Stephen Duck</HI> came to write Ver&s;es, and how he manag'd in writing them. Philo&s;ophers find as much Subject for their Admiration in the minute&s;t Bodies, as in the large&s;t; and a Poet from the Barn, tho' not &s;o great a Man, is as great a Curio&s;ity, as a Dictator from the Plow. I can be particular enough as to his fir&s;t &s;etting out in Poetry; and, &s;ince you &s;eem to de&s;ire it, &s;hall give you all the Cir|cum&s;tances I could learn from a Week's Conver&s;ation with him in all his Simplicity; without con&s;idering, that many of them, to a Per&s;on le&s;s curi|ous, might appear too trifling to be mention'd even in a Letter.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11">
MY Friend <HI>Stephen</HI> had originally no other Teaching, than what enabled him to read, and write <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; he had never taken a &s;ingle Step toward any other Language. As Arithmetic is generally join'd with this Degree of Learning, he had a little Share of that too. About his Fourteenth Year he was taken from School, and was afterwards &s;ucce&s;&s;ively engag'd in the &s;e|veral lowe&s;t Employments of a Country Life. This la&s;ted for &s;ome Years; &s;o long, that he had forgot almo&s;t all the Arithmetic he had learn'd at School: However he read &s;ometimes, and thought oftener. He had a cer|tain Longing after Knowledge; and when he reflected within him&s;elf on his want of Education, he began to be particularly unea&s;y, that he &s;hould have forgot &s;omething of what he had learnt, even at the little School he had been at. He thought of this &s;o often, that at la&s;t he re&s;olv'd to try his own Strength; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to recover his Arithmetic again.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t Attempt of this kind I take to have been about Six Years ago. Con&s;idering the Difficulties the poor Fellow lay under, this Inclination for Knowledge mu&s;t have been very &s;trong in him. He was then marry'd, and at Service; he had little Time to &s;pare; he had no Books, and no Money to get any: But he was re&s;olv'd to go thro' with it; and accordingly us'd to work more than other Day-labourers, and by that means got &s;ome little matter added to his Pay. This Overplus was at his own Di&s;po&s;al. With this he bought fir&s;t a Book of Vulgar Arithmetic, then one of Decimal, and a third of Mea&s;uring of Land; all which by degrees he made him&s;elf a to|lerable Ma&s;ter of, in tho&s;e Hours he could &s;teal from his Sleep, after the Labours of the Day.</P>
<P>WHERE there was &s;uch a De&s;ire for Knowledge, there mu&s;t be good Sen&s;e at bottom, and a Soul, at lea&s;t, &s;omewhat above the common Con|ver&s;ation he mu&s;t meet with in his poor State of Life. I have ask'd him, whom he had that he could talk and conver&s;e with in the Country; and was pleas'd to find him, in this Particular, happier than I expected. He &s;aid, he had one dear Friend, that he mention'd with uncommon Affection. They us'd to talk and read together, when they could &s;teal a little Time for it. This Friend had been in a Service at <HI>London</HI> for two or three Years: He had an Inclination to Books; he had purchas'd &s;ome, and brought 'em down with him into the Country; and <HI>Stephen</HI> had always the U&s;e of his little Library; which by this Time, po&s;&s;ibly, may be increas'd to two or three dozen of Books. This Friend knew no more out of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than <HI>Stephen</HI>; but by talking together they mutually improv'd each other. <HI>Ste|phen</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
is all Simplicity: He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That his Friend can talk better than he, as having been more us'd to Company; but that he him&s;elf has been more us'd to Poetry, and in that can do better than his Friend."</Q></P>
<P>HAD it not been for this, <HI>Stephen</HI> mu&s;t have been plac'd in the &s;ame Cla&s;s with <HI>Hai Ebn Yokdhan,</HI> and the young <HI>Hermes</HI> in Mr. <HI>Ram&s;ay</HI>'s <HI>Cyrus:</HI> But the Story of their Improvements without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance agrees only with Romances; and you know, what I am writing to you is a true Hi&s;tory. Our retir'd Philo&s;opher had his Friend; and it &s;eems to have been the greate&s;t Happine&s;s of his Life, that he had one. They did not only read, but rea&s;on'd over Points together; and I have &s;ometimes thought, how agreeable a thing it would have been, to have been conceal'd within hearing of them, when they were in the mid&s;t of &s;ome of their mo&s;t knotty Debates. We may imagine 'em both to have had good natural Sen&s;e, and a few good Books in common between 'em: Their Minds were their own; neither improv'd, nor &s;poil'd, by laying in a Stock of Learning: They were perhaps equally well inclin'd to learn, both &s;truggling for a little Knowledge; and, like a Couple of Rowers on the &s;ame Bottom, while they were only &s;triving perhaps, which &s;hould out do his Companion, they were really each helping the other, and driving the Boat on the fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>PERHAPS you would be willing to know what Books their little Library con&s;i&s;ted of. I need not mention tho&s;e of Arithmetic again, nor his Bible: <HI>Milton,</HI> the <HI>Spectators,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> were his fir&s;t Favourites; <HI>Telemachus,</HI> with another Piece by the &s;ame Hand, and <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Defence of Chri&s;tia|nity, his next. They had an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dictionary, and a &s;ort of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grammar, an <HI>Ovid</HI> of long Standing with them, and a <HI>Bys&s;he</HI>'s Art of Po|etry of later Acqui&s;ition: <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Morals had made the Name of <HI>L'E&s;trange</HI> dear to them; and, as I imagine, might occa&s;ion their getting his <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in Folio, which was the large&s;t Purchace in their Collection: They had one Volume of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with Seven of his Plays in it. Be&s;ide the&s;e, <HI>Stephen</HI> had read Three or Four other Plays; &s;ome of <HI>Epictetus, Waller, Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil, Prior, Hudibras, Tom Brown,</HI> and the <HI>London Spy.</HI> You may &s;ee I am a faithful Hi&s;torian, by my giving you the Bad with the Good.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e Helps <HI>Stephen</HI> is grown &s;omething of a Poet, and &s;ome|thing of a Philo&s;opher. I find by him, that from his Infancy, he has had a Ca&s;t in his Mind toward Poetry. He has delighted, as far back as he can remember, in Ver&s;es, and in Singing. He &s;peaks of &s;trange Emotions, that he has felt on the top Performances of the little Choir of Song&s;ters in

<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
a Country Chancel; and mentions his fir&s;t hearing of an Organ, as a re|markable Epocha of his Life. He &s;eems to be a pretty good Judge too of a mu&s;ical Line; but I imagine, that he does not hear Ver&s;es in his own Mind, as he repeats them. I don't know whether you under&s;tand me. I mean, that his Ideas of the Notes in a Ver&s;e, and his Manner of repeating the &s;ame Ver&s;e, are often different: For he points out an harmonious Line well enough; and yet he generally &s;poils its Harmony by his way of &s;peaking it.</P>
<P>WHAT fir&s;t gave him a higher Ta&s;te of Poetry, than he had been us'd to, was <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> This came oddly enough into his Hands; and when I &s;ee you, I'll tell you the Hi&s;tory of it. <HI>Stephen</HI> read it over twice or thrice with a Dictionary, before he could under&s;tand the Language of it thoroughly. This, and a &s;ort of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grammar they had, have been of the greate&s;t U&s;e to him of any thing.</P>
<P>INDEED it &s;eems plain to me, that he has got <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ju&s;t as we get <HI>Latin.</HI> He &s;tudy'd <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> as others &s;tudy the Cla&s;&s;ics. The new Beauties in that Poem, that were continually opening upon his Mind, made all his Labour ea&s;y to him. He work'd all Day for his Ma&s;ter; and, after the Labour of the Day, &s;et to his Books at Night. The Pains he has taken for the Plea&s;ure of improving him&s;elf, are incredible; but it has an&s;wer'd too beyond what one could have expected; for he &s;eems to under&s;tand &s;ome of the great and deeper Beauties of that Poem tolerably well; and points out &s;everal particular Beauties in it, which it requires a good nice Eye to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>'TWAS his Friend that help'd him to the <HI>Spectators</HI>; they read them often together, and often by them&s;elves. <HI>Stephen</HI> tells me, that he has frequently carry'd them with him to his Work. When he did &s;o, his Method was to labour harder than any body el&s;e, that he might get half an Hour to read a <HI>Spectator,</HI> without injuring his Ma&s;ter. By this means he us'd to &s;it down all over Sweat and Heat, without regarding his own Health, and often to the Prejudice of it. If this affects you, as it has me, I ought not to pa&s;s it over, that you may not lo&s;e the Plea&s;ure of &s;o &s;trong an In&s;tance of Hone&s;ty and Indu&s;try mix'd together.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spectators</HI> improv'd his Under&s;tanding, he &s;ays, more than any thing. The Copies of Ver&s;es, &s;catter'd in tho&s;e Pieces, help'd on his natural Bent that way; and made him willing to try, whether he could not do &s;omething like 'em. He &s;ometimes turn'd his own Thoughts into Ver&s;e, while he
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
was at Work; and at la&s;t begun to venture tho&s;e Thoughts a little on Paper. What he did of this kind, was very incon&s;iderable; only &s;catter'd Thoughts, and generally not above four or five Lines on the &s;ame Subject; which, as there was nobody thereabouts that car'd for Ver&s;es, nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad, he generally flung into the Fire, as &s;oon as he had pleas'd him&s;elf enough in reading them.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Care he took to burn the&s;e little Pieces, he found it not &s;ufficient to conceal them. The Thing took Air; and <HI>Stephen,</HI> who had before the Name of a Scholar among the Country People, was &s;aid now to be able to write Ver&s;es too. This was mention'd accidentally, about a Year ago, before a young Gentleman of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who &s;ent for <HI>Stephen</HI>; and after &s;ome Talk with him, de&s;ir'd him to write him a Letter in Ver&s;e. That Letter is the Epi&s;tle which &s;tands the la&s;t in his Poems, but was the fir&s;t whole Copy of Ver&s;es that ever he wrote. This happen'd to fall into the Hands of &s;ome Clergymen in the Neighbourhood, who were very well pleas'd with it; and upon examining him, found the Man had a good deal of Merit. They gave him &s;ome Pre&s;ents, which, as Things &s;tood then, were a great Help to him; and encourag'd him to go on as much as they could.</P>
<P>THIS made him proceed with more Courage: And, as he had wrote &s;ome &s;catter'd Ver&s;es on <HI>Poverty,</HI> before this happen'd, he carry'd tho&s;e Thoughts on, and fill'd it up, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent in the printed Collection I &s;end you: So that this is his &s;econd Copy. I am very careful in &s;ettling the Chronology of his Poems, that you may &s;ee how he has gone on Step by Step, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Compo&s;ition which was next in Order, is that on his own <HI>Labours:</HI> That Subject was given him by one of tho&s;e who fir&s;t encourag'd him; and after this was fini&s;h'd, he was employ'd from the &s;ame Quarter in his <HI>Shunammite.</HI> As this exceeded any of the re&s;t, I think from hence we may date the Aera of his ri&s;ing in his Character and Circum&s;tances. Upon this it was that Per|&s;ons of Di&s;tinction began to &s;end for him different ways. In &s;hort, it got him Fame enough to be pretty trouble &s;ome to him at fir&s;t; tho' it is likely to end in a much happier Settlement of him and his Affairs, than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his fir&s;t &s;etting out.</P>
<P>WHEN you have read his Poems, and con&s;ider the Manner he has been bred up in, I doubt not you will think they have their Merit: But I a&s;&s;ure you, they give an imperfect Idea of the Man; and, to know how much he de|&s;erves,
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
one &s;hould conver&s;e with him, and hear on what Rea&s;ons he omitted &s;uch a Part, and introduc'd another; why he &s;hortens his Style in this Place, and enlarges in that; whence he has &s;uch a Word, and whence &s;uch an Idea. I'll give you all I can recollect of this kind, in relation to what is generally reckon'd the be&s;t Thing he has wrote, <HI>The Shunammite.</HI></P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place, I found upon Inquiry, that he wrote by a Plan; he thought over all the Parts, as he intended to u&s;e them, before he made the Ver&s;es. For a Poem of any Length, no doubt 'tis as nece&s;&s;ary to do this, as it is to have a Draught of a Hou&s;e, before you go to building it; and yet I believe, the common Run of our Poets have generally thought them&s;elves above it, or not thought of it at all. Tho' the <HI>Shunammite</HI> was written on a Story given to his hand, &s;till &s;omething of this kind was convenient enough; becau&s;e, in forming it anew, he did not make u&s;e of all the Materials before him, and has brought in &s;ome of his own. He thought, the Stretching of the Prophet in &s;o particular a manner, mu&s;t &s;ound &s;trange. The Woman introduc'd to tell her Story, is a new Ca&s;t of his own; &s;o is her Doubting, and then Confirming her&s;elf again, by a particular Induction of all <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Miracles; &s;o the Bringing an Audience about her, and their Chorus's, when they join together in congratulating her Happine&s;s; the la&s;t of which clo&s;es the Poem in a good proper manner.</P>
<P>UPON being ask'd, Why he introduc'd a Per&s;on to tell all the Story in the <HI>Shunammite,</HI> and why he could not as well tell it him&s;elf; he &s;aid, he had read <HI>Prior</HI>'s <HI>Solomon</HI>; and that, in reading it, <HI>Solomon</HI>'s &s;peaking every thing touch'd him particularly. He was then ask'd, &s;ince it was to be &s;poken, why he did not rather chu&s;e the Prophet, as the Per&s;on of the greater Dig|nity, to &s;peak it. He &s;aid to this, That the Woman was to be pity'd; That there &s;eem'd to him to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Such as the&s;e:
<Q>Ver. 16. And &s;he &s;aid; Nay, my Lord, thou Man of God, do not tye unto thy Handmaid.</Q><Q>Ver. 28. Did I de&s;ire a Son of my Lord? Did I not &s;ay, Do not deceive me?</Q></NOTE>&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of the Woman in the Hi&s;tory, which, if not omitted, might le&s;&s;en our Regard and Compa&s;&s;ion for her; That, if the Prophet had related the Thing, he could not have omitted a Word; but when the Woman did, &s;he might well be allow'd to &s;often her own Ca&s;e; and to drop, when &s;he was cool, any thing wrong, that &s;he had &s;aid in the Violence of her Grief and Pa&s;&s;ion. This is rather fuller in Words than he expre&s;s'd it; but nothing, I think, is added to his Meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18">
AS <HI>Milton</HI> had been his favourite Poet, you may wonder why none of his Pieces are in blank Ver&s;e. I ask'd him about this too: Upon which he told me, That he had originally written the whole <HI>Shunammite</HI> in blank Ver&s;e; That, upon reading it over, he found his Language was not &s;ublime enough for it; and that therefore he was forc'd to write it all over again, and turn it into Rhyme.</P>
<P>UPON reading over the Chapter and his Poem together, you will &s;ee how ju&s;tly he &s;hortens and enlarges &s;ome of the particular Pa&s;&s;ages, in order to adapt them the more to Poetry. Be&s;ides &s;ome Things already mention'd, he drops &s;everal little Circum&s;tances in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See 2 Kings, Chap. iv. Ver&s;es 10, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, and 35.</NOTE>. On the other hand, he enlarges on the <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Line 33 to 49.</NOTE>Contentedne&s;s and Charities of the Woman; on the <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">55, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>Look and Attitude of the Prophet; on her <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Thanks for bearing a Son; on <NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">112 to 134.</NOTE>the Death of the Child; on the <NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">152, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See 205.</NOTE>Rea&s;ons of her Confidence in the Prophet; in <NOTE N="6" PLACE="marg">211.</NOTE>pointing out the Prophet, when &s;he comes to him; and in <NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">219.</NOTE>his An&s;wer; in her <NOTE N="8" PLACE="marg">232.</NOTE>pre&s;&s;ing the Prophet more earne&s;tly to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; in <NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg">246.</NOTE>pointing out the dead Child; his being <NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">258.</NOTE>freed from Death; and her Thoughts <NOTE N="11" PLACE="marg">266.</NOTE>upon receiving him again into her Arms.</P>
<P>'TIS agreeable to &s;ee what U&s;e he has made of the little Reading he can have had, and how he has improv'd the Thing, by ob&s;erving &s;ome good Strokes in the Books he has met with. Upon my telling him, that I lik'd nothing better in it, than his altering <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">From Line 55 to 63.</NOTE>the Prophet's Countenance as he does; he &s;aid, he took that Hint from <HI>Telemachus</HI>; where the young Prince comes to <HI>Idomeneus</HI>'s Court, while they are &s;acrificing. The Prie&s;t, on &s;eeing <HI>Telemachus,</HI> breaks off from what he was about, a&s;&s;umes a more in&s;pir'd Air, and begins &s;peaking of his future Fortunes. This Alteration of the Prophet's Countenance, <HI>Stephen</HI> &s;ays, he took from thence; but that at the &s;ame time he thought him&s;elf oblig'd to drop the Wildne&s;s and Enthu&s;ia&s;m of it, in order to adapt it more to the Nature of a true Prophet.</P>
<P>THE Chorus in the Clo&s;e of the <HI>Shunammite,</HI> he &s;aid, was brought into his Mind by the <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> Book 7. Line 565, and 602.</NOTE>general Rejoicing of the Angels in <HI>Milton,</HI> upon God's
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">
fini&s;hing the Creation of the World. The fir&s;t Chorus was not in the Work originally; he in&s;erted it, when he new-form'd it all into Rhyme.</P>
<P>HE had al&s;o been very careful as to &s;ingle Words; and had Authorities to produce in &s;everal little Particulars, where one would not expect it. For <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Shunammite,</HI> Ver. 210.</NOTE><HI>flow'ry Carmel,</HI> he quotes Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>; and the Prophet's Arbour on the Top of that Mount is cover'd with <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">212.</NOTE><HI>Vines,</HI> on the Authority of Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> in his Travels: For the Words <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">177, and 249.</NOTE><HI>adu&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;upernal,</HI> he refers to <HI>Milton:</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE><HI>Fanatic</HI> he u&s;es according to the true, and not the vulgar Sen&s;e of the Word; he had learn'd the proper Meaning of it from his Dictionary: <NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">143.</NOTE><HI>Dilated Heart,</HI> as &s;poken of Sorrow, is certainly a Fault; but it is a Fault that <HI>Stephen</HI> was naturally enough led into by the common Notion and Expre&s;&s;ions in the Country, of the Heart's <HI>&s;welling</HI> and being ready to <HI>bur&s;t</HI> with Grief.</P>
<P>HE owns his Faults very readily; and if he thinks a Line of his better than ordinary, he will &s;ay &s;o without any Re&s;erve. He &s;eems to be exceedingly open and hone&s;t in every thing he &s;ays; and 'twould be very difficult for you to be with him a Week, as I have been, without going away very much his Friend.</P>
<P>THO' I have been &s;o long in &s;hewing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own Works; I &s;hall add &s;ome of his Thoughts on the Works of others, to give you as full an Idea of him as I can.</P>
<P>'TIS not yet three Years ago that he fir&s;t met with <HI>Milton</HI>; and I believe, that was the fir&s;t Poet of real Value, that he ever &s;tudy'd in earne&s;t. He has a&s;&s;ur'd me, with all his Innocence and Simplicity, that when he came after|wards to read <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Critici&s;ms on <HI>Milton</HI> in the <HI>Spectators,</HI> 'twas a high Plea&s;ure to him to find many Things mention'd there, in the Prai&s;e of <HI>Milton,</HI> exactly as he had before thought in reading him. Here we mu&s;t depend on his Credit, which I need not tell you with me is very good.</P>
<P>THE Name of <HI>Milton,</HI> whom he admires and dotes on &s;o particularly, has not prevail'd on him enough to make him like his <HI>Paradi&s;e Regain'd.</HI> In &s;peaking of the&s;e two Poems, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he wonder'd how <HI>Milton</HI> could write &s;o incomparably well, where he had &s;o little to lead him; and &s;o very poorly, where he had more."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="20">
THE <HI>Spectators,</HI> you know, he has read with great Plea&s;ure, and great Improvement. I remember particularly, that on &s;omebody's calling them <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"'Twas true, they were <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>; but there was &s;omething in 'em, that pleas'd almo&s;t like <HI>Ver&s;e.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;He mention'd, with more Regard than u&s;ual, the critical Papers on Wit, tho&s;e on <HI>Milton,</HI> the <HI>Ju&s;tum &amp; tenacem</HI> from <HI>Horace,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and the &s;everal &s;catter'd ones written in the Cau&s;e of Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>UPON asking him what Plays he had read, he nam'd particularly <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar, Hamlet, Cato, Venice Pre&s;erv'd,</HI> and <HI>the Orphan. Venice Pre|&s;erv'd,</HI> he &s;aid, gave him the mo&s;t <HI>Horror</HI>; a Word which I took notice he us'd &s;ometimes for Sorrow, and &s;ometimes in its proper Sen&s;e: He could not bear the comic Parts in it. <HI>Hamlet</HI> he lik'd better than <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>; and in <HI>Hamlet</HI> pointed out that celebrated Speech, <HI>To be, or not to be,</HI> &amp;c. as having been his favourite Part, merely of his own Ta&s;te. He did not admire <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Comedy; and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He was too high, and too low."</Q> I read over to him &s;ome of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the celebrated Speeches of <HI>Antony</HI> to the People in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> He trembled, as I read the Gho&s;t's Speech; and admir'd the Speeches and Turns in the Mob round <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Body, more, he &s;aid, than ever he had done before. As I was reading to him, I ob&s;erv'd that his Countenance chang'd often in the mo&s;t moving Parts: His Eye was quick and bu&s;y all the time; and, to &s;ay the Truth, I never &s;aw Applau&s;e, or the &s;hifting of proper Pa&s;&s;ions, appear &s;o &s;trongly in any Face as in his.</P>
<P>HE had formerly read <HI>Tom Brown</HI>'s <HI>Letters from the Dead,</HI> and the <HI>London Spy,</HI> not without &s;ome Plea&s;ure; but, after he had been &s;ome time conver&s;ant with the <HI>Spectators,</HI> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He did not care much to look into them."</Q> He &s;poke of <HI>Hudibras</HI> in another manner; he &s;aw a great deal of Wit in it, and was particularly pleas'd with the Conjurer's Part in that Poem: But, after all, 'tis not a Manner of writing that he can &s;o &s;in|cerely delight in, as in the Moral, the Pa&s;&s;ionate, or the Sublime.</P>
<P>INDEED what every body &s;eems to admire him for, is, that he &s;eems to have an excellent moral Turn in his Thoughts. He is, as I told you before, &s;omething of a Philo&s;opher; and, what is better than a Philo&s;opher, a good hone&s;t-hearted Man. He has read, and &s;peaks highly of, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Demon&s;tration of the Being of a God, and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Defence of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That they touch'd his Mind; and that nothing did &s;o well, as when one's Rea&s;on is mov'd by what is &s;aid."</Q>
<PB N="xx" REF="21">
He had lik'd the little he had read of <HI>Epictetus</HI>; but 'twas <HI>Seneca</HI> that had made him happy in his own Mind. He &s;eems as yet not to be hurt at all by any Applau&s;es that have been given him, and to have been perfectly con|tented with his Condition before: When he had only receiv'd &s;ome Pre|&s;ents from Gentlemen in the Country, he was quite ea&s;y as to his Circum|&s;tances. The only Thing then, that he was &s;olicitous about, was, how he might &s;ucceed as to the Poetry he &s;hould be employ'd in. This was his chief Concern: But even this &s;eem'd to proceed not &s;o much from any De&s;ire of Fame, as from a Principle of Gratitude; or, as he expre&s;s'd it, his Longing to plea&s;e tho&s;e Friends that had been &s;o generous to him. He was not lifted up with the Character &s;ome People gave him, and talk'd of Fame ab&s;olutely like a Philo&s;opher. After his be&s;t Fortune, many of his Friends told him the Danger of being vain; and, if he &s;hould once be &s;o, that he would be as much de&s;pis'd as he had been applauded. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That he could not well tell what they meant; That he did not know what it was to be vain: But, &s;ince &s;o many great Men, who knew the World &s;o much better than he did, were apprehen&s;ive for him on that head, he began to be terribly alarm'd at his Danger, tho' he had no &s;ettled Ideas of what it was."</Q> He was told upon this, That he &s;hould never &s;peak too highly in Prai&s;e of the Poems he had written. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If that was all, he was &s;afe; that was a Thing he could never do, for he could not think highly of them: Gentlemen indeed, he &s;aid, might like 'em, becau&s;e they were made by a poor Fellow in a Barn; but that he knew, as well as any body, that they were not really good in them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I have obey'd your Commands as faithfully as I am able. You de&s;ir'd me not to &s;pare Paper; but to &s;end you a Book rather than a Letter. You &s;ee I have taken you at your Word; and that I am re&s;olv'd, in this, as well as in every thing el&s;e, to &s;hew you how punctually I would ever be,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>_I Have, before the Time pre&s;crib'd by you,</L>
<L>Expos'd my weak Production to your View,</L>
<L>Which may, I hope, have Pardon at your Hand,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e produc'd to Light by your Com|mand</L>
<L>Perhaps you might expect &s;ome fini&s;h'd Ode,</L>
<L>Or &s;acred Song, to &s;ound the Prai&s;e of God;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="44">
A glorious Thought, and laudable! But then</L>
<L>Think what illit'rate Poet guides the Pen:</L>
<L>Ill &s;uit &s;uch Tasks with one who holds the Plough,</L>
<L>Such lofty Subjects with a Fate &s;o low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIR, were your Eloquence and Learning mine,</L>
<L>And I, like you, a Fav'rite of the Nine;</L>
<L>I quickly would <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI>' Summit climb,</L>
<L>And find a Hero worthy of my Rhyme:</L>
<L>Nor &s;hould my Mu&s;e the <HI>Grecian</HI> Monarchs trace,</L>
<L>Nor would I celebrate the <HI>Trojan</HI> Race;</L>
<L>Nor any of tho&s;e martial Sons of Fame,</L>
<L>Pagans, unworthy of a Chri&s;tian's Theme.</L>
<L>Far nobler Thoughts my grateful Voice &s;hould rai&s;e,</L>
<L>In lofty Strains, to great MESSIAH's Prai&s;e:</L>
<L>I'd joyfully re&s;ound his wond'rous Birth,</L>
<L>And paint his Godlike Virtues, whil&s;t on Earth;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="45">
Then, with Reluctance, Horror, and Surprize,</L>
<L>I'd mournfully relate his Agonies;</L>
<L>I'd trace the heav'nly Hero to the Tree,</L>
<L>Sing what he &s;uffer'd there for you and me;</L>
<L>Next, in heroic Numbers, would I tell,</L>
<L>How &s;oon he baffled Death, and vanqui&s;h'd Hell,</L>
<L>Subdu'd the Grave, and &s;hew'd the glorious Way,</L>
<L>From Realms of Darkne&s;s, to eternal Day.</L>
<L>Such noble Subjects &s;hould my Lays excite;</L>
<L>And you, my Patron, would in &s;uch delight;</L>
<L>Grateful to me, when you, well-pleas'd, &s;hould view</L>
<L>Th'accompli&s;h'd &s;acred Song in&s;crib'd to you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now I mu&s;t omit MESSIAH's Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Le&s;t I degrade him with unworthy Lays;</L>
<L>My Fate compels me &s;ilent to remain,</L>
<L>For want of Learning to improve my Strain:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="46">
By which no Thought, tho' well conceiv'd, can ri&s;e</L>
<L>To full Perfection, but in Embryo dies:</L>
<L>Yet my unpoli&s;h'd Genius will produce,</L>
<L>And bring forth &s;omething, tho' of little U&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, in the Country, often have I found,</L>
<L>Thro' &s;lothful Man's Neglect, a Plat of Ground,</L>
<L>Wa&s;te and uncultivated, void of Seeds,</L>
<L>Producing nothing, but &s;ome trifling Weeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT why &s;tand I my Fate accu&s;ing &s;o?</L>
<L>The Field calls me to Labour; I mu&s;t go:</L>
<L>The Kine low after Meat; the hungry Steed,</L>
<L>Neighing, complains he wants his u&s;ual Feed.</L>
<L>Then, Sir, adieu: Accept what you did crave,</L>
<L>And be propitious to your humble Slave.</L>
