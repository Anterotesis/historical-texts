<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING is more u&s;ual and more natural for tho&s;e, who pretend to di&s;cover any thing new to the world in philo&s;ophy and the &s;ciences, than to in&s;inuate the prai&s;es of their own &s;y&s;tems, by decrying all tho&s;e, which have been advanced before them. And indeed were they content with lamenting that igno|rance, which we &s;till lie under in the mo&s;t important que&s;tions, that can come before the tribunal of human rea&s;on, there are few, who have an acquaintance with the &s;ciences, that would not readily agree with them. 'Tis ea&s;y for one of judgment and learning,
<PB REF="11">
to perceive the weak foundation even of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which have obtained the greate&s;t credit, and have carried their pre|ten&s;ions highe&s;t to accurate and profound rea&s;oning. Principles taken upon tru&s;t, con|&s;equences lamely deduced from them, want of coherence in the parts, and of evidence in the whole, the&s;e are every where to be met with in the &s;y&s;tems of the mo&s;t emi|nent philo&s;ophers, and &s;eem to have drawn di&s;grace upon philo&s;ophy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOR is there requir'd &s;uch profound know|ledge to di&s;cover the pre&s;ent imperfect con|dition of the &s;ciences, but even the rabble without doors may judge from the noi&s;e and clamour, which they hear, that all goes not well within. There is nothing which is not the &s;ubject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The mo&s;t trivial que&s;tion e&s;capes not our contro|ver&s;y, and in the mo&s;t momentous we are not able to give any certain deci&s;ion. Di&s;putes are multiplied, as if every thing was uncer|tain; and the&s;e di&s;putes are managed with the greate&s;t warmth, as if every thing was certain. Amid&s;t all this bu&s;tle 'tis not rea|&s;on, which carries the prize, but eloquence; and no man needs ever de&s;pair of gaining pro&s;elytes to the mo&s;t extravagant hypothe&s;is,
<PB N="3" REF="12">
who has art enough to repre&s;ent it in any favourable colours. The victory is not gained by the men at arms, who manage the pike and the &s;word; but by the trumpeters, drum|mers, and mu&s;icians of the army.</P>
<P>FROM hence in my opinion ari&s;es that common prejudice again&s;t metaphy&s;ical rea|&s;onings of all kinds, even among&s;t tho&s;e, who profe&s;s them&s;elves &s;cholars, and have a ju&s;t value for every other part of literature. By metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings, they do not un|der&s;tand tho&s;e on any particular branch of &s;cience, but every kind of argument, which is any way ab&s;tru&s;e, and requires &s;ome at|tention to be comprehended. We have &s;o often lo&s;t our labour in &s;uch re&s;earches, that we commonly reject them without he&s;itation, and re&s;olve, if we mu&s;t for ever be a prey to errors and delu&s;ions, that they &s;hall at lea&s;t be natural and entertaining. And indeed nothing but the mo&s;t determined &s;ceptici&s;m, along with a great degree of indolence, can ju&s;tify this aver&s;ion to metaphy&s;ics. For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity, 'tis certain it mu&s;t lie very deep and ab&s;tru&s;e; and to hope we &s;hall arrive at it without pains, while the greate&s;t geniu&s;es have failed with the utmo&s;t pains, mu&s;t cer|tainly be e&s;teemed &s;ufficiently vain and pre|&s;umptuous.
<PB N="4" REF="13">
I pretend to no &s;uch advantage in the philo&s;ophy I am going to unfold, and would e&s;teem it a &s;trong pre&s;umption again&s;t it, were it &s;o very ea&s;y and obvious.</P>
<P>'TIS EVIDENT, that all the &s;ciences have a relation, greater or le&s;s, to human nature; and that however wide any of them may &s;eem to run from it, they &s;till return back by one pa&s;&s;age or another. Even <HI>Mathema|tics, Natural Philo&s;ophy, and Natural Reli|gion,</HI> are in &s;ome mea&s;ure dependent on the &s;cience of MAN; &s;ince they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to tell what changes and improvements we might make in the&s;e &s;ciences were we tho|roughly acquainted with the extent and force of human under&s;tanding, and cou'd explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our rea&s;onings. And the&s;e improvements are the more to be hoped for in natural religion, as it is not con|tent with in&s;tructing us in the nature of &s;u|perior powers, but carries its views farther, to their di&s;po&s;ition towards us, and our duties towards them; and con&s;equently we our|&s;elves are not only the beings, that rea&s;on, but al&s;o one of the objects, concerning which we rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
IF therefore the &s;ciences of Mathematics, Natural Philo&s;ophy, and Natural Religion, have &s;uch a dependence on the knowledge of man, what may be expected in the other &s;ciences, who&s;e connexion with human na|ture is more clo&s;e and intimate? The &s;ole end of logic is to explain the principles and operations of our rea&s;oning faculty, and the nature of our ideas: morals and critici&s;m regard our ta&s;tes and &s;entiments: and poli|tics con&s;ider men as united in &s;ociety, and dependent on each other. In the&s;e four &s;ciences of <HI>Logic, Morals, Critici&s;m, and Po|litics,</HI> is comprehended almo&s;t every thing, which it can any way import us to be ac|quainted with, or which can tend either to the improvement or ornament of the human mind.</P>
<P>HERE then is the only expedient, from which we can hope for &s;ucce&s;s in our philo|&s;ophical re&s;earches, to leave the tedious ling|ring method, which we have hitherto fol|lowed, and in&s;tead of taking now and then a ca&s;tle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to the capital or center of the&s;e &s;ciences, to human nature it&s;elf; which be|ing once ma&s;ters of, we may every where el&s;e hope for an ea&s;y victory. From this &s;tation we may extend our conque&s;ts over
<PB N="6" REF="15">
all tho&s;e &s;ciences, which more intimately concern human life, and may afterwards pro|ceed at lei&s;ure to di&s;cover more fully tho&s;e, which are the objects of pure curio&s;ity. There is no que&s;tion of importance, who&s;e deci&s;ion is not compriz'd in the &s;cience of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any certainty, before we become acquainted with that &s;cience. In pretending therefore to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect propo&s;e a compleat &s;y&s;tem of the &s;ciences, built on a foundation almo&s;t entirely new, and the only one upon which they can &s;tand with any &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>AND as the &s;cience of man is the only &s;olid foundation for the other &s;ciences, &s;o the only &s;olid foundation we can give to this &s;cience it&s;elf mu&s;t be laid on experience and ob&s;ervation 'Tis no a&s;toni&s;hing reflection to con&s;ider, that the application of experimen|tal philo&s;ophy to moral &s;ubjects &s;hould come after that to natural at the di&s;tance of above a whole century; &s;ince we find in fact, that there was about the &s;ame interval betwixt the origins of the&s;e &s;ciences; and that reck|oning from THALES to SOCRATES, the &s;pace of time is nearly equal to that betwixt my Lord BACON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> my Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Mandeville,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> Dr. <HI>Butler,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> and &s;ome late philo&s;ophers
<PB N="7" REF="16">
in <HI>England,</HI> who have begun to put the &s;ci|ence of man on a new footing, and have engaged the attention, and excited the curio|&s;ity of the public. So true it is, that how|ever other nations may rival us in poetry, and excel us in &s;ome other agreeable arts, the improvements in rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy can only be owing to a land of toleration and of liberty.</P>
<P>NOR ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the &s;cience of man will do le&s;s honour to our native country than the former in natural philo&s;ophy, but ought ra|ther to e&s;teem it a greater glory, upon ac|count of the greater importance of that &s;ci|ence, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity it lay under of &s;uch a reformation. For to me it &s;eems evi|dent, that the e&s;&s;ence of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, it mu&s;t be equally impo&s;&s;ible to form any notion of its powers and qualities other|wi&s;e than from careful and exact experi|ments, and the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e particu|lar effects, which re&s;ult from its different circum&s;tances and &s;ituations. And tho' we mu&s;t endeavour to render all our principles as univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible, by tracing up our ex|periments to the utmo&s;t, and explaining all effects from the &s;imple&s;t and fewe&s;t cau&s;es,
<PB N="8" REF="17">
'tis &s;till certain we cannot go beyond expe|rience; and any hypothe&s;is, that pretends to di&s;cover the ultimate original qualities of hu|man nature, ought at fir&s;t to be rejected as pre&s;umptuous and chimerical.</P>
<P>I DO not think a philo&s;opher, who would apply him&s;elf &s;o earne&s;tly to the explaining the ultimate principles of the &s;oul, would &s;how him&s;elf a great ma&s;ter in that very &s;cience of human nature, which he pretends to explain, or very knowing in what is na|turally &s;atisfactory to the mind of man. For nothing is more certain, than that de&s;pair has almo&s;t the &s;ame effect upon us with enjoyment, and that we are no &s;ooner ac|quainted with the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;atisfying any de&s;ire, than the de&s;ire it&s;elf vani&s;hes. When we &s;ee, that we have arrived at the utmo&s;t extent of human rea&s;on, we &s;it down contented; tho' we be perfectly &s;atisfied in the main of our ignorance, and perceive that we can give no rea&s;on for our mo&s;t general and mo&s;t refined principles, be&s;ide our expe|rience of their reality; which is the rea&s;on of the mere vulgar, and what it required no &s;tudy at fir&s;t to have di&s;covered for the mo&s;t particular and mo&s;t extraordinary phae|nomenon. And as this impo&s;&s;ibility of mak|ing any farther progre&s;s is enough to &s;atisfy
<PB N="9" REF="18">
the reader, &s;o the writer may derive a more delicate &s;atisfaction from the free confe&s;&s;ion of his ignorance, and from his prudence in avoiding that error, into which &s;o many have fallen, of impo&s;ing their conjectures and hypothe&s;es on the world for the mo&s;t certain principles. When this mutual con|tentment and &s;atisfaction can be obtained betwixt the ma&s;ter and &s;cholar, I know not what more we can require of our philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>BUT if this impo&s;&s;ibility of explaining ul|timate principles &s;hould be e&s;teemed a defect in the &s;cience of man, I will venture to affirm, that 'tis a defect common to it with all the &s;ciences, and all the arts, in which we can employ our&s;elves, whether they be &s;uch as are cultivated in the &s;chools of the philo&s;ophers, or practi&s;ed in the &s;hops of the meane&s;t artizans. None of them can go beyond experience, or e&s;tabli&s;h any princi|ples which are not founded on that autho|rity. Moral philo&s;ophy has, indeed, this pe|culiar di&s;advantage, which is not found in natural, that in collecting its experiments, it cannot make them purpo&s;ely, with premedi|tation, and after &s;uch a manner as to &s;atisfy it&s;elf concerning every particular difficulty which may ari&s;e. When I am at a lo&s;s to
<PB N="10" REF="19">
know the effects of one body upon another in any &s;ituation, I need only put them in that &s;ituation, and ob&s;erve what re&s;ults from it. But &s;hould I endeavour to clear up after the &s;ame manner any doubt in moral philo|&s;ophy, by placing my&s;elf in the &s;ame ca&s;e with that which I con&s;ider, 'tis evident this reflection and premeditation would &s;o di&s;turb the operation of my natural principles, as mu&s;t render it impo&s;&s;ible to form any ju&s;t conclu&s;ion from the phaenomenon. We mu&s;t therefore glean up our experiments in this &s;cience from a cautious ob&s;ervation of hu|man life, and take them as they appear in the common cour&s;e of the world, by men's behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their plea&s;ures. Where experiments of this kind are judiciou&s;ly collected and compared, we may hope to e&s;tabli&s;h on them a &s;cience, which will not be inferior in certainty, and will be much &s;uperior in utility to any other of human comprehen&s;ion.</P>

<P>_ALL the perceptions of the human mind re&s;olve them&s;elves into two di&s;tinct kinds, which I &s;hall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS. The difference betwixt the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the degrees of force and liveline&s;s, with which

By <HI>ideas</HI> I mean the faint images of the&s;e in thinking and rea&s;oning; &s;uch as, for in&s;tance, are all the perceptions excited by the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e, excepting only, tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the &s;ight and touch, and excepting the immediate plea&s;ure or unea&s;ine&s;s it may oc|ca&s;ion. I believe it will not be very nece&s;|&s;ary to employ many words in explaining this di&s;tinction. Every one of him&s;elf will rea|dily perceive the difference betwixt feeling and thinking. The common degrees of the&s;e are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed; tho' it is not impo&s;|&s;ible but in particular in&s;tances they may very nearly approach to each other. Thus in &s;leep, in a fever, in madne&s;s, or in any very violent emotions of &s;oul, our ideas may ap|proach to our impre&s;&s;ions: As on the other hand it &s;ometimes happens, that the impre&s;|&s;ions are &s;o faint and low, that we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h them from our ideas.

By the term of impre&s;&s;ion I would not be under&s;tood to expre&s;s the manner, in which our lively perceptions are produced in the &s;oul, but merely the perceptions them&s;elves; for which there is no particular name either in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or any other language, that I know of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another divi&s;ion of our percep|tions, which it will be convenient to ob&s;erve, and which extends it&s;elf both to our impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas. This divi&s;ion is into SIMPLE and COMPLEX. Simple perceptions or im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas are &s;uch as admit of no di&s;tinction nor &s;eparation. The complex are the contrary to the&s;e, and may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into parts. Tho' a particular colour, ta&s;te, and &s;mell are qualities all united toge|ther in this apple, 'tis ea&s;y to perceive they are not the &s;ame, but are at lea&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|able from each other.</P>
<P>HAVING by the&s;e divi&s;ions given an order and arrangement to our objects, we may now apply our&s;elves to con&s;ider with the more accuracy their qualities and relations. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance, that &s;trikes my eye, is the great re&s;emblance betwixt our impre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="14" REF="23">
and ideas in every other particular, except their degree of force and vivacity. The one &s;eem to be in a manner the reflexion of the other; &s;o that all the perceptions of the mind are double, and appear both as impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas. When I &s;hut my eyes and think of my chamber, the ideas I form are exact repre&s;entations of the impre&s;&s;ions I felt; nor is there any circum&s;tance of the one, which is not to be found in the other. In running over my other perceptions, I find &s;till the &s;ame re&s;emblance and repre&s;entation. Ideas and impre&s;&s;ions appear always to cor|re&s;pond to each other. This circum&s;tance &s;eems to me remarkable, and engages my attention for a moment.</P>
<P>UPON a more accurate &s;urvey I find I have been carried away too far by the fir&s;t appearance, and that I mu&s;t make u&s;e of the di&s;tinction of perceptions into <HI>&s;imple and complex,</HI> to limit this general deci&s;ion, <HI>that all our ideas and impre&s;&s;ions are re&s;embling.</HI> I ob&s;erve, that many of our complex ideas never had impre&s;&s;ions, that corre&s;ponded to them, and that many of our complex im|pre&s;&s;ions never are exactly copied in ideas. I can imagine to my&s;elf &s;uch a city as the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who&s;e pavement is gold and walls are rubies, tho' I never &s;aw any &s;uch.
<PB N="15" REF="24">
I have &s;een <HI>Paris;</HI> but &s;hall I affirm I can form &s;uch an idea of that city, as will per|fectly repre&s;ent all its &s;treets and hou&s;es in their real and ju&s;t proportions?</P>
<P>I PERCEIVE, therefore, that tho' there is in general a great re&s;emblance betwixt our <HI>complex</HI> impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, yet the rule is not univer&s;ally true, that they are exact co|pies of each other. We may next con&s;ider how the ca&s;e &s;tands with our <HI>&s;imple</HI> percep|tions. After the mo&s;t accurate examination, of which I am capable, I venture to affirm, that the rule here holds without any excep|tion, and that every &s;imple idea has a &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion, which re&s;embles it; and every &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion a corre&s;pondent idea. That idea of red, which we form in the dark, and that impre&s;&s;ion, which &s;trikes our eyes in &s;un-&s;hine, differ only in degree, not in na|ture. That the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with all our &s;imple impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble to prove by a particular enumeration of them. Every one may &s;atisfy him&s;elf in this point by running over as many as he plea&s;es. But if any one &s;hould deny this univer&s;al re|&s;emblance, I know no way of convincing him, but by de&s;iring him to &s;hew a &s;imple impre&s;|&s;ion, that has not a corre&s;pondent idea, or a &s;imple idea, that has not a corre&s;pondent im|pre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="16" REF="25">
If he does not an&s;wer this chal|lenge, as 'tis certain he cannot, we may from his &s;ilence and our own ob&s;ervation e&s;tabli&s;h our conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THUS we find, that all &s;imple ideas and impre&s;&s;ions re&s;emble each other; and as the complex are formed from them, we may affirm in general, that the&s;e two &s;pecies of perception are exactly corre&s;pondent. Having di&s;cover'd this relation, which requires no farther examination, I am curious to find &s;ome other of their qualities. Let us con|&s;ider how they &s;tand with regard to their exi&s;tence, and which of the impre&s;&s;ions and ideas are cau&s;es, and which effects.</P>
<P>THE <HI>full</HI> examination of this que&s;tion is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent treati&s;e; and there|fore we &s;hall here content our&s;elves with e&s;tabli&s;hing one general propo&s;ition, <HI>That all our &s;imple ideas in their fir&s;t appearance are deriv'd from &s;imple impre&s;&s;ions, which are cor|re&s;pondent to them, and which they exactly repre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;eeking for phaenomena to prove this propo&s;ition, I find only tho&s;e of two kinds; but in each kind the phaenomena are obvious, numerous, and conclu&s;ive. I fir&s;t make my|&s;elf certain, by a new review, of what I have already a&s;&s;erted, that every &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="17" REF="26">
is attended with a corre&s;pondent idea, and every &s;imple idea with a corre&s;pondent im|pre&s;&s;ion. From this con&s;tant conjunction of re&s;embling perceptions I immediately con|clude, that there is a great connexion be|twixt our corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, and that the exi&s;tence of the one has a con|&s;iderable influence upon that of the other. Such a con&s;tant conjunction, in &s;uch an in|finite number of in&s;tances, can never ari&s;e from chance; but clearly proves a dependence of the impre&s;&s;ions on the ideas, or of the ideas on the impre&s;&s;ions. That I may know on which &s;ide this dependence lies, I con&s;i|der the order of their <HI>fir&s;t appearance;</HI> and find by con&s;tant experience, that the &s;imple impre&s;&s;ions always take the precedence of their corre&s;pondent ideas, but never appear in the contrary order. To give a child an idea of &s;carlet or orange, of &s;weet or bitter, I pre&s;ent the objects, or in other words, con|vey to him the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; but proceed not &s;o ab&s;urdly, as to endeavour to produce the impre&s;&s;ions by exciting the ideas. Our ideas upon their appearance produce not their corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions, nor do we per|ceive any colour, or feel any &s;en&s;ation merely upon thinking of them. On the other hand we find, that any impre&s;&s;ions either of the
<PB N="18" REF="27">
mind or body is con&s;tantly followed by an idea, which re&s;embles it, and and is only different in the degrees of force and liveline&s;s. The con&s;tant conjunction of our re&s;embling perceptions, is a convincing proof, that the one are the cau&s;es of the other; and this prio|rity of the impre&s;&s;ions is an equal proof, that our impre&s;&s;ions are the cau&s;es of our ideas, not our ideas of our impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>TO confirm this I con&s;ider another plain and convincing phaenomenon; which is, that where-ever by any accident the faculties, which give ri&s;e to any impre&s;&s;ions, are ob|&s;tructed in their operations, as when one is born blind or deaf; not only the impre&s;&s;ions are lo&s;t, but al&s;o their corre&s;pondent ideas; &s;o that there never appear in the mind the lea&s;t traces of either of them. Nor is this only true, where the organs of &s;en&s;ation are entirely de&s;troy'd, but likewi&s;e where they have never been put in action to produce a particular impre&s;&s;ion. We cannot form to our&s;elves a ju&s;t idea of the ta&s;te of a pine|apple, without having actually ta&s;ted it.</P>
<P>THERE is however one contradictory phaenomenon, which may prove, that 'tis not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for ideas to go before their corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions. I believe it will readily be allow'd, that the &s;e|veral
<PB N="19" REF="28">
di&s;tinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, or tho&s;e of &s;ounds, which are convey'd by the hearing, are really different from each other, tho' at the &s;ame time re|&s;embling. Now if this be true of different colours, it mu&s;t be no le&s;s &s;o of the different &s;hades of the &s;ame colour, that each of them produces a di&s;tinct idea, independent of the re&s;t. For if this &s;hou'd be deny'd, 'tis po&s;|&s;ible, by the continual gradation of &s;hades, to run a colour in&s;en&s;ibly into what is mo&s;t remote from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you cannot without ab&s;urdity deny the extremes to be the &s;ame. Suppo&s;e therefore a per&s;on to have enjoyed his &s;ight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one particular &s;hade of blue, for in&s;tance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different &s;hades of that colour, except that &s;ingle one, be plac'd before him, de|&s;cending gradually from the deepe&s;t to the lighte&s;t; 'tis plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that &s;hade is wanting, and will be &s;en&s;ible, that there is a greater di|&s;tance in that place betwixt the contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I a&s;k, whe|ther 'tis po&s;&s;ible for him, from his own ima|gination,
<PB N="20" REF="29">
to &s;upply this deficiency, and rai&s;e up to him&s;elf the idea of that particular &s;hade, tho' it had never been conveyed to him by his &s;en&s;es? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may &s;erve as a proof, that the &s;imple ideas are not always derived from the cor|re&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions; tho' the in&s;tance is &s;o particular and &s;ingular, that 'tis &s;carce worth our ob&s;erving, and does not merit that for it alone we &s;hould alter our general maxim.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this exception, it may not be ami&s;s to remark on this head, that the principle of the priority of impre&s;&s;ions to ideas mu&s;t be under&s;tood with another limita|tion, <HI>viz.</HI> that as our ideas are images of our impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o we can form &s;econdary ideas, which are images of the primary; as appears from this very rea&s;oning concerning them. This is not, properly &s;peaking, an exception to the rule &s;o much as an explanation of it. Ideas produce the images of them&s;elves in new ideas; but as the fir&s;t ideas are &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from impre&s;&s;ions, it &s;till remains true, that all our &s;imple ideas proceed either mediately or immediately, from their corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="30">
THIS then is the fir&s;t principle I e&s;tabli&s;h in the &s;cience of human nature; nor ought we to de&s;pi&s;e it becau&s;e of the &s;implicity of its appearance. For 'tis remarkable, that the pre&s;ent que&s;tion concerning the precedency of our impre&s;&s;ions or ideas, is the &s;ame with what has made &s;o much noi&s;e in other terms, when it has been di&s;puted whether there be any <HI>innate ideas,</HI> or whether all ideas be de|rived from &s;en&s;ation and reflexion. We may ob&s;erve, that in order to prove the ideas of exten&s;ion and colour not to be innate, philo|&s;ophers do nothing but &s;hew, that they are conveyed by our &s;en&s;es. To prove the ideas of pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ire not to be innate, they ob&s;erve that we have a preceding experience of the&s;e emotions in our&s;elves. Now if we carefully examine the&s;e arguments, we &s;hall find that they prove nothing but that ideas are preceded by other more lively perceptions, from which they are derived, and which they repre&s;ent. I hope this clear &s;tating of the que&s;tion will remove all di&s;putes concerning it, and will render this principle of more u&s;e in our rea&s;onings, than it &s;eems hitherto to have been.</P>

<P>SINCE it appears, that our &s;imple im|pre&s;&s;ions are prior to their corre&s;pon|dent ideas, and that the exceptions are very rare, method &s;eems to require we &s;hould examine our impre&s;&s;ions, before we con&s;ider our ideas. Impre&s;&s;ions may be divided into two kinds, tho&s;e of SENSATION and tho&s;e of REFLEXION. The fir&s;t kind ari&s;es in the &s;oul originally, from unknown cau&s;es. The &s;econd is derived in a great mea&s;ure from our ideas, and that in the following order. An impre&s;&s;ion fir&s;t &s;trikes upon the &s;en&s;es, and makes us perceive heat or cold, thir&s;t or hunger, plea&s;ure or pain of &s;ome kind or other. Of this impre&s;&s;ion there is a copy taken by the mind, which remains after the impre&s;&s;ion cea&s;es; and this we call an idea. This idea of plea&s;ure or pain, when it returns upon the &s;oul, produces the new impre&s;&s;ions of de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, hope and fear, which may properly be called impre&s;&s;ions of refle|xion, becau&s;e derived from it. The&s;e again are copied by the memory and imagination, and become ideas; which perhaps in their turn give ri&s;e to other impre&s;&s;ions and ideas.
<PB N="23" REF="32">
So that the impre&s;&s;ions of reflexion are only antecedent to their corre&s;pondent ideas; but po&s;terior to tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ation, and deriv'd from them. The examination of our &s;en&s;a|tions belongs more to anatomi&s;ts and natural philo&s;ophers than to moral; and therefore &s;hall not at pre&s;ent be enter'd upon. And as the impre&s;&s;ions of reflection, <HI>viz.</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, de&s;ires, and emotions, which principally de|&s;erve our attention, ari&s;e mo&s;tly from ideas, 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary to rever&s;e that method, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems mo&s;t natural; and in order to explain the nature and principles of the human mind, give a particular ac|count of ideas, before we proceed to impre&s;|&s;ions. For this rea&s;on I have here cho&s;en to begin with ideas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the ideas of the memory and imagination.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE find by experience, that when any impre&s;&s;ion has been pre&s;ent with the mind, it again makes its appearance there as an idea; and this it may do after two diffe|rent ways: either when in its new appearance it retains a con&s;iderable degree of its fir&s;t vi|vacity, and is &s;omewhat intermediate betwixt
<PB N="24" REF="33">
an impre&s;&s;ion and an idea; or when it in|tirely lo&s;es that vivacity, and is a perfect idea. The faculty, by which we repeat our im|pre&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t manner, is called the MEMORY, and the other the IMAGINA|TION. 'Tis evident at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the ideas of the memory are much more lively and &s;trong than tho&s;e of the imagination, and that the former faculty paints its objects in more di&s;tinct colours, than any which are employ'd by the latter. When we re|member any pa&s;t event, the idea of it flows in upon the mind in a forcible manner; whereas in the imagination the perception is faint and languid, and cannot without dif|ficulty be pre&s;erv'd by the mind &s;teddy and uniform for any con&s;iderable time. Here then is &s;en&s;ible difference betwixt one &s;pe|cies of ideas and another. But of this more fully hereafter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part III. Sect. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another difference betwixt the&s;e two kinds of ideas, which is no le&s;s evident, namely that tho' neither the ideas of the me|mory nor imagination, neither the lively nor faint ideas can make their appearance in the mind, unle&s;s their corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions have gone before to prepare the way for them, yet the imagination is not re&s;train'd to the &s;ame order and form with the ori|ginal
<PB N="25" REF="34">
impre&s;&s;ions; while the memory is in a manner ty'd down in that re&s;pect, with|out any power of variation.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that the memory pre&s;erves the original form, in which its objects were pre&s;ented, and that where-ever we depart from it in recollecting any thing, it proceeds from &s;ome defect or imperfection in that fa|culty. An hi&s;torian may, perhaps, for the more convenient carrying on of his narration, relate an event before another, to which it was in fact po&s;terior; but then he takes no|tice of this di&s;order, if he be exact; and by that means replaces the idea in its due po&s;i|tion. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e in our recollection of tho&s;e places and per&s;ons, with which we were formerly acquainted. The chief exerci&s;e of the memory is not to pre&s;erve the &s;imple ideas, but their order and po&s;ition. In &s;hort, this principle is &s;upported by &s;uch a number of common and vulgar phaenomena, that we may &s;pare our&s;elves the trouble of in&s;i&s;ting on it any farther.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame evidence follows us in our &s;a|cond principle, <HI>of the liberty of the imagina|tion to tran&s;po&s;e and change its ideas.</HI> The fables we meet with in poems and romances put this entirely out of que&s;tion. Nature there is totally confounded, and nothing men|tioned
<PB N="26" REF="35">
but winged hor&s;es, fiery dragons, and mon&s;trous giants. Nor will this liberty of the fancy appear &s;trange, when we con&s;ider, that all our ideas are copy'd from our impre&s;|&s;ions, and that there are not any two impre&s;|&s;ions which are perfectly in&s;eparable. Not to mention, that this is an evident con&s;e|quence of the divi&s;ion of ideas into &s;imple and complex. Where-ever the imagination perceives a difference among ideas, it can ea|&s;ily produce a &s;eparation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the connexion or a&s;&s;ociation of ideas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS all &s;imple ideas may be &s;eparated by the imagination, and may be united again in what form it plea&s;es, nothing wou'd be more unaccountable than the operations of that faculty, were it not guided by &s;ome uni|ver&s;al principles, which render it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, uniform with it&s;elf in all times and places. Were ideas entirely loo&s;e and un|connected, chance alone wou'd join them; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the &s;ame &s;imple ideas &s;hould fall regularly into complex ones (as they com|monly do) without &s;ome bond of union among them, &s;ome a&s;&s;ociating quality, by
<PB N="27" REF="36">
which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting principle among ideas is not to be con&s;ider'd as an in&s;eparable connexion; for that has been already excluded from the imagination: Nor yet are we to conclude, that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing is more free than that fa|culty: but we are only to regard it as a gen|tle force, which commonly prevails, and is the cau&s;e why, among other things, languages &s;o nearly corre&s;pond to each other; nature in a manner pointing out to every one tho&s;e &s;imple ideas, which are mo&s;t proper to be united into a complex one. The qualities, from which this a&s;&s;ociation ari&s;es, and by which the mind is after this manner con|vey'd from one idea to another, are three, <HI>viz.</HI> RESEMBLANCE, CONTIGUITY in time or place, and CAUSE and EFFECT.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will not be very nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that the&s;e qualities produce an a&s;|&s;ociation among ideas, and upon the appear|ance of one idea naturally introduce another. 'Tis plain, that in the cour&s;e of our think|ing, and in the con&s;tant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs ea&s;ily from one idea to any other that <HI>re&s;embles</HI> it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a &s;ufficient bond and a&s;&s;ociation. 'Tis likewi&s;e evident,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
that as the &s;en&s;es, in changing their objects, are nece&s;&s;itated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie <HI>contiguous</HI> to each other, the imagination mu&s;t by long cu&s;tom acquire the &s;ame method of thinking, and run along the parts of &s;pace and time in con|ceiving its objects. As to the connexion, that is made by the relation of <HI>cau&s;e and effect,</HI> we &s;hall have occa&s;ion afterwards to examine it to the bottom, and therefore &s;hall not at pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;t upon it. 'Tis &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that there is no relation, which produces a &s;tronger connexion in the fancy, and makes one idea more readily recall an|other, than the relation of cau&s;e and effect betwixt their objects.</P>
<P>THAT we may under&s;tand the full ex|tent of the&s;e relations, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that two objects are connected together in the imagination, not only when the one is immediately re&s;embling, contiguous to, or the cau&s;e of the other, but al&s;o when there is interpo&s;ed betwixt them a third object, which bears to both of them any of the&s;e relations. This may be carried on to a great length; tho' at the &s;ame time we may ob|&s;erve, that each remove con&s;iderably weakens the relation. Cou&s;ins in the fourth degree are connected by <HI>cau&s;ation,</HI> if I may be allowed
<PB N="29" REF="38">
to u&s;e that term; but not &s;o clo&s;ely as bro|thers, much le&s;s as child and parent. In general we may ob&s;erve, that all the rela|tions of blood depend upon cau&s;e and effect, and are e&s;teemed near or remote, according to the number of connecting cau&s;es interpos'd betwixt the per&s;ons.</P>
<P>OF the three relations above-mention'd this of cau&s;ation is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive. Two objects may be con&s;ider'd as plac'd in this re|lation, as well when one is the cau&s;e of any of the actions or motions of the other, as when the former is the cau&s;e of the exi&s;tence of the latter. For as that action or motion is nothing but the object it&s;elf, con&s;ider'd in a certain light, and as the object continues the &s;ame in all its different &s;ituations, 'tis ea&s;y to imagine how &s;uch an influence of objects upon one another may connect them in the imagination.</P>
<P>WE may carry this farther, and remark, not only that two objects are connected by the relation of cau&s;e and effect, when the one produces a motion or any action in the other, but al&s;o when it has a power of pro|ducing it. And this we may ob&s;erve to be the &s;ource of all the relations of intere&s;t and duty, by which men influence each other in &s;ociety, and are plac'd in the ties of govern|ment
<PB N="30" REF="39">
and &s;ubordination. A ma&s;ter is &s;uch-a|one as by his &s;ituation, ari&s;ing either from force or agreement, has a power of directing in cer|tain particulars the actions of another, whom we call &s;ervant. A judge is one, who in all di&s;puted ca&s;es can fix by his opinion the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion or property of any thing betwixt any members of the &s;ociety. When a per&s;on is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any power, there is no more re|quired to convert it into action, but the ex|ertion of the will; and <HI>that</HI> in every ca&s;e is con&s;ider'd as po&s;&s;ible, and in many as proba|ble; e&s;pecially in the ca&s;e of authority, where the obedience of the &s;ubject is a plea&s;ure and advantage to the &s;uperior.</P>
<P>THESE are therefore the principles of union or cohe&s;ion among our &s;imple ideas, and in the imagination &s;upply the place of that in&s;eparable connexion, by which they are united in our memory. Here is a kind of ATTRACTION, which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to &s;hew it&s;elf in as ma|ny and as various forms. Its effects are every where con&s;picuous; but as to its cau&s;es, they are mo&s;tly unknown, and mu&s;t be re&s;olv'd into <HI>original</HI> qualities of human nature, which I pretend not to explain. Nothing is more requi&s;ite for a true philo&s;opher, than to re|&s;train
<PB N="31" REF="40">

<P>AMONGST the effects of this union or a&s;|&s;ociation of ideas, there are none more re|markable, than tho&s;e complex ideas, which are the common &s;ubjects of our thoughts and rea&s;oning, and generally ari&s;e from &s;ome prin|ciple of union among our &s;imple ideas.

<P>THE word RELATION is commonly u&s;ed in two &s;en&s;es con&s;iderably diffe|rent from each other. Either for that quali|ty, by which two ideas are connected toge|ther in the imagination, and the one naturally introduces the other, after the manner above|explained; or for that particular circum|&s;tance, in which, even upon the arbitrary union of two ideas in the fancy, we may think proper to compare them. In common language the former is always the &s;en&s;e, in which we u&s;e the word, relation; and 'tis only in philo&s;ophy, that we extend it to mean any particular &s;ubject of compari&s;on, without a connecting principle. Thus di&s;tance will be allowed by philo&s;ophers to be a true relation, becau&s;e we acquire an idea of it by the comparing of objects: But in a common way we &s;ay, <HI>that nothing can be more di&s;tant than &s;uch or &s;uch things from each other, no|thing can have le&s;s relation;</HI> as if di&s;tance and relation were incompatible.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be e&s;teemed an endle&s;s ta&s;k to enumerate all tho&s;e qualities, which
<PB N="33" REF="42">
make objects admit of compari&s;on, and by which the ideas of <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> relation are produced. But if we diligently con&s;ider them, we &s;hall find that without difficulty they may be compriz'd under &s;even general heads, which may be con&s;idered as the &s;ources of all <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> relation.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t is <HI>re&s;emblance:</HI> And this is a relation, without which no philo&s;ophical relation can exi&s;t; &s;ince no objects will ad|mit of compari&s;on, but what have &s;ome de|gree of re&s;emblance. But tho' re&s;emblance be nece&s;&s;ary to all philo&s;ophical relation, it does not follow, that it always produces a connexion or a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. When a quality becomes very general, and is common to a great many individuals, it leads not the mind directly to any one of them; but by pre&s;enting at once too great a choice, does thereby prevent the imagination from fixing on any &s;ingle object.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Identity</HI> may be e&s;teem'd a &s;econd &s;pe|cies of relation. This relation I here con&s;i|der as apply'd in its &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e to con&s;tant and unchangeable objects; without examin|ing the nature and foundation of per&s;onal identity, which &s;hall find its place afterwards. Of all relations the mo&s;t univer&s;al is that of
<PB N="34" REF="43">
identity, being common to every being, who&s;e exi&s;tence has any duration.</P>
<P N="3">3. AFTER identity the mo&s;t univer&s;al and comprehen&s;ive relations are tho&s;e of <HI>Space</HI> and <HI>Time,</HI> which are the &s;ources of an infi|nite number of compari&s;ons, &s;uch as <HI>di&s;tant, contiguous, above, below, before, after,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. ALL tho&s;e objects, which admit of <HI>quantity,</HI> or <HI>number,</HI> may be compar'd in that particular; which is another very fertile &s;ource of relation.</P>
<P N="5">5. WHEN any two objects po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame <HI>quality</HI> in common, the <HI>degrees,</HI> in which they po&s;&s;e&s;s it, form a fifth &s;pecies of relation. Thus of two objects, which are both heavy, the one may be either of greater, or le&s;s weight than with the other. Two colours, that are of the &s;ame kind, may yet be of different &s;hades, and in that re|&s;pect admit of compari&s;on.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE relation of <HI>contrariety</HI> may at fir&s;t &s;ight be regarded as an exception to the rule, <HI>that no relation of any kind can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without &s;ome degree of re&s;emblance.</HI> But let us con&s;ider, that no two ideas are in them&s;elves contrary, except tho&s;e of exi&s;tence and non-exi&s;tence, which are plainly re&s;em|bling, as implying both of them an idea of the object; tho' the latter excludes the ob|ject
<PB N="35" REF="44">
from all times and places, in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. ALL other objects, &s;uch as fire and water, heat, and cold, are only found to be contrary from experience, and from the con|trariety of their <HI>cau&s;es</HI> or <HI>effects;</HI> which re|lation of cau&s;e and effect is a &s;eventh philo&s;o|phical relation, as well as a natural one. The re&s;emblance implied in this relation, &s;hall be explain'd afterwards.</P>
<P>IT might naturally be expected, that I &s;hould join <HI>difference</HI> to the other relations. But that I con&s;ider rather as a negation of relation, than as any thing real or po&s;itive. Difference is of two kinds as oppos'd either to identity or re&s;emblance. The fir&s;t is call'd a difference of <HI>number;</HI> the other of <HI>kind.</HI></P>

<P>I WOU'D fain a&s;k tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who found &s;o much of their rea&s;onings on the di&s;tinction of &s;ub&s;tance and accident, and imagine we have clear ideas of each, whether the idea of <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> be deriv'd from the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;ation of reflection? If it be convey'd to us by our &s;en&s;es, I a&s;k, which of them; and after what manner?

If it be perceiv'd by the eyes, it mu&s;t be a colour; if by the ears, a &s;ound; if by the pa|late, a ta&s;te; and &s;o of the other &s;en&s;es. But I believe none will a&s;&s;ert, that &s;ub&s;tance is either a colour, or &s;ound, or a ta&s;te. The idea of &s;ub&s;tance mu&s;t therefore be deriv'd from an impre&s;&s;ion of reflection, if it really exi&s;t. But the impre&s;&s;ions of reflection re|&s;love them&s;elves into our pa&s;&s;ions and emo|tions; none of which can po&s;&s;ibly repre&s;ent a &s;ub&s;tance. We have therefore no idea of &s;ub&s;tance, di&s;tinct from that of a collection of particular qualities, nor have we any other meaning when we either talk or rea|&s;on concerning it.</P>
<P>THE idea of a &s;ub&s;tance as well as that of a mode, is nothing but a collection of &s;imple ideas, that are united by the imagination, and have a particular name a&s;&s;igned them, by which we are able to recal, either to our&s;elves or others, that collection. But the difference betwixt the&s;e ideas con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the particular qualities, which form a &s;ub&s;tance, are commonly refer'd to an un|known <HI>&s;omething,</HI> in which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to inher; or granting this fiction &s;hould not take place, are at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be clo&s;ely and in&s;eparably connected by the relations of contiguity and cau&s;ation. The effect of
<PB N="37" REF="48">
this is, that whatever new &s;imple quality we di&s;cover to have the &s;ame connexion with the re&s;t, we immediately comprehend it among them, even tho' it did not enter into the fir&s;t conception of the &s;ub&s;tance. Thus our idea of gold may at fir&s;t be a yellow colour, weight, malleablene&s;s, fu&s;ibility; but upon the di&s;covery of its di&s;&s;olubility in <HI>aqua regia,</HI> we join that to the other qualities, and &s;up|po&s;e it to belong to the &s;ub&s;tance as much as if its idea had from the beginning made a part of the compound one. The principle of union being regarded as the chief part of the complex idea, gives entrance to whatever quality afterwards occurs, and is equally com|prehended by it, as are the others, which fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THAT this cannot take place in modes, is evident from con&s;idering their nature. The &s;imple ideas of which modes are formed, ei|ther repre&s;ent qualities, which are not uni|ted by contiguity and cau&s;ation, but are di&s;|pers'd in different &s;ubjects; or if they be all united together, the uniting principle is not regarded as the foundation of the complex idea. The idea of a dance is an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind of modes; that of beauty of the &s;econd. The rea&s;on is obvious, why &s;uch complex ideas cannot receive any new
<PB N="38" REF="49">
idea, without changing the name, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the mode.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Of ab&s;tract ideas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A VERY material que&s;tion has been &s;tarted concerning <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> or <HI>general</HI> ideas, <HI>whether they be general or particular in the mind's conception of them.</HI> A <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Berkeley.</HI></NOTE> great philo&s;opher has di&s;puted the receiv'd opinion in this particular, and has a&s;&s;erted, that all general ideas are nothing but particular ones, annexed to a certain term, which gives them a more exten&s;ive &s;ignification, and makes them recal upon occa&s;ion other individuals, which are &s;imilar to them. As I look upon this to be one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t va|luable di&s;coveries that has been made of late years in the republic of letters, I &s;hall here endeavour to confirm it by &s;ome arguments, which I hope will put it beyond all doubt and controver&s;y.</P>
<P>'TIS EVIDENT, that in forming mo&s;t of our general ideas, if not all of them, we ab&s;tract from every particular degree of quantity and quality, and that an object cea&s;es not to be of any particular &s;pecies on
<PB N="39" REF="50">
account of every &s;mall alteration in its ex|ten&s;ion, duration and other properties. It may therefore be thought, that here is a plain dilemma, that decides concerning the na|ture of tho&s;e ab&s;tract ideas, which have af|forded &s;o much &s;peculation to philo&s;ophers. The ab&s;tract idea of a man repre&s;ents men of all &s;izes and all qualities; which 'tis con|cluded it cannot do, but either by repre|&s;enting at once all po&s;&s;ible &s;izes and all po&s;|&s;ible qualities, or by repre&s;enting no parti|cular one at all. Now it having been e|&s;teemed ab&s;urd to defend the former pro|po&s;ition, as implying an infinite capacity in the mind, it has been commonly infer'd in favour of the latter; and our ab&s;tract ideas have been &s;uppos'd to repre&s;ent no particular degree either of quantity or quality. But that this inference is erroneous. I &s;hall en|deavour to make appear, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by proving, that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any quantity or quality, without forming a pre|ci&s;e notion of its degrees: And <HI>&s;econdly</HI> by &s;howing, that tho' the capacity of the mind be not infinite, yet we can at once form a notion of all po&s;&s;ible degrees of quantity and quality, in &s;uch a manner at lea&s;t, as, how|ever imperfect, may &s;erve all the purpo&s;es of reflection and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="51">
To begin with the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, <HI>that the mind cannot form any notion of quantity or quality without forming a preci&s;e notion of degrees of each;</HI> we may prove this by the three following arguments. Fir&s;t, We have ob&s;erv'd, that whatever objects are different are di&s;tingui&s;hable, and that whatever ob|jects are di&s;tingui&s;hable are &s;eparable by the thought and imagination. And we may here add, that the&s;e propo&s;itions are equally true in the <HI>inver&s;e,</HI> and that whatever ob|jects are &s;eparable are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hable, and that whatever objects are di&s;tingui&s;h|able are al&s;o different. For how is it po&s;&s;ible we can &s;eparate what is not di&s;tingui&s;hable, or di&s;tingui&s;h what is not different? In or|der therefore to know, whether ab&s;traction implies a &s;eparation, we need only con&s;ider it in this view, and examine, whether all the circum&s;tances, which we ab&s;tract from in our general ideas, be &s;uch as are di&s;tin|gui&s;hable and different from tho&s;e, which we retain as e&s;&s;ential parts of them. But 'tis evident at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the preci&s;e length of a line is not different nor di&s;tingui&s;hable from the line it&s;elf; nor the preci&s;e degree of any quality from the quality. The&s;e ideas, therefore, admit no more of &s;eparation than they do of di&s;tinction and difference. They
<PB N="41" REF="52">
are con&s;equently conjoined with each other in the conception; and the general idea of a line, notwith&s;tanding all our ab&s;tractions and refinements, has in its appearance in the mind a preci&s;e degree of quantity and qua|lity; however it may be made to repre&s;ent others, which have different degrees of both.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, 'tis confe&s;t, that no object can appear to the &s;en&s;es; or in other words, that no impre&s;&s;ion can become pre&s;ent to the mind, without being determin'd in its de|grees both of quantity and quality. The confu&s;ion, in which impre&s;&s;ions are &s;ome|times involv'd, proceeds only from their faintne&s;s and un&s;teadine&s;s, not from any ca|pacity in the mind to receive any impre&s;&s;ion, which in its real exi&s;tence has no particular degree nor proportion. That is a contra|diction in terms; and even implies the flat|te&s;t of all contradictions, <HI>viz.</HI> that 'tis po&s;|&s;ible for the &s;ame thing both to be and not to be.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince all ideas are deriv'd from impre&s;&s;ions, and are nothing but copies and repre&s;entations of them, whatever is true of the one mu&s;t be acknowledg'd concerning the other. Impre&s;&s;ions and ideas differ only in their &s;trength and vivacity. The fore|going conclu&s;ion is not founded on any par|ticular
<PB N="42" REF="53">
degree of vivacity. It cannot there|fore be affected by any variation in that particular. An idea is a weaker impre&s;|&s;ion; and as a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have a determinate quantity and quality, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ame with its copy or repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, 'tis a principle generally re|ceiv'd in philo&s;ophy, that every thing in na|ture is individual, and that 'tis utterly ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e a triangle really exi&s;tent, which has no preci&s;e proportion of &s;ides and angles. If this therefore be ab&s;urd in <HI>fact and reality,</HI> it mu&s;t al&s;o be ab&s;urd <HI>in idea;</HI> &s;ince nothing of which we can form a clear and di&s;tinct idea is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. But to form the idea of an object, and to form an idea &s;imply is the &s;ame thing; the reference of the idea to an object being an extraneous denomination, of which in it&s;elf it bears no mark or character. Now as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to form an idea of an object, that is po&s;&s;e&s;t of quantity and quality, and yet is po&s;&s;e&s;t of no preci&s;e degree of either; it follows, that there is an equal impo&s;&s;ibility of forming an idea, that is not limited and confin'd in both the&s;e particulars. Ab&s;tract ideas are therefore in them&s;elves individual, however they may become general in their
<PB N="43" REF="54">
repre&s;entation. The image in the mind is only that of a particular object, tho' the application of it in our rea&s;oning be the &s;ame, as if it were univer&s;al.</P>
<P>THIS application of ideas beyond their nature proceeds from our collecting all their po&s;&s;ible degrees of quantity and quality in &s;uch an imperfect manner as may &s;erve the purpo&s;es of life, which is the &s;econd pro|po&s;ition I propos'd to explain. When we have found a re&s;emblance among &s;everal ob|jects, that often occur to us, we apply the &s;ame name to all of them, whatever differ|ences we may ob&s;erve in the degrees of their quantity and quality, and whatever other differences may appear among them. After we have acquired a cu&s;tom of this kind, the hearing of that name revives the idea of one of the&s;e objects, and makes the imagination conceive it with all its particular circum|&s;tances and proportions. But as the &s;ame word is &s;uppos'd to have been frequently applied to other individuals, that are diffe|rent in many re&s;pects from that idea, which is immediately pre&s;ent to the mind; the word not being able to revive the idea of all the&s;e individuals, but only touches the &s;oul, if I may be allow'd &s;o to &s;peak, and re|vives that cu&s;tom, which we have acquir'd
<PB N="44" REF="55">
by &s;urveying them. They are not really and in fact pre&s;ent to the mind, but only in power; nor do we draw them all out di&s;tinctly in the imagination, but keep our&s;elves in a readine&s;s to &s;urvey any of them, as we may be prompted by a pre|&s;ent de&s;ign or nece&s;&s;ity. The word rai&s;es up an individual idea, along with a cer|tain cu&s;tom; and that cu&s;tom produces any other individual one, for which we may have occa&s;ion. But as the production of all the ideas, to which the name may be ap|ply'd, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es impo&s;&s;ible, we abridge that work by a more partial con&s;ideration, and find but few inconveniences to ari&s;e in our rea&s;oning from that abridgment.</P>
<P>FOR this is one of the mo&s;t extraordi|nary circum&s;tances in the pre&s;ent affair, that after the mind has produc'd an individual idea, upon which we rea&s;on, the attendant cu&s;tom, reviv'd by the general or ab&s;tract term, readily &s;ugge&s;ts any other individual, if by chance we form any rea&s;oning, that agrees not with it. Thus &s;hou'd we men|tion the word, triangle, and form the idea of a particular equilateral one to corre&s;pond to it, and &s;hou'd we afterwards a&s;&s;ert, <HI>that the three angles of a triangle are equal to each other,</HI> the other individuals of a &s;calenum
<PB N="45" REF="56">
and i&s;oceles, which we over-look'd at fir&s;t, immediately crowd in upon us, and make us perceive the fal&s;hood of this propo&s;ition, tho' it be true with relation to that idea, which we had form'd. If the mind &s;ug|ge&s;ts not always the&s;e ideas upon occa&s;ion, it proceeds from &s;ome imperfection in its faculties; and &s;uch a one as is often the &s;ource of fal&s;e rea&s;oning and &s;ophi&s;try. But this is principally the ca&s;e with tho&s;e ideas which are ab&s;tru&s;e and compounded. On other occa&s;ions the cu&s;tom is more entire, and 'tis &s;eldom we run into &s;uch errors.</P>
<P>NAY &s;o entire is the cu&s;tom, that the very &s;ame idea may be annext to &s;everal dif|ferent words, and may be employ'd in dif|ferent rea&s;onings, without any danger of mi&s;takes. Thus the idea of an equilateral triangle of an inch perpendicular may &s;erve us in talking of a figure, of a rectilineal figure, of a regular figure, of a triangle, and of an equilateral triangle. All the&s;e terms, therefore, are in this ca&s;e attended with the &s;ame idea; but as they are wont to be ap|ply'd in a greater or le&s;&s;er compa&s;s, they ex|cite their particular habits, and thereby keep the mind in a readine&s;s to ob&s;erve, that no conclu&s;ion be form'd contrary to any ideas, which are u&s;ually compriz'd under them.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="57">
BEFORE tho&s;e habits have become en|tirely perfect, perhaps the mind may not be content with forming the idea of only one individual, but may run over &s;everal, in or|der to make it&s;elf comprehend its own meaning, and the compa&s;s of that collection, which it intends to expre&s;s by the general term. That we may fix the meaning of the word, figure, we may revolve in our mind the ideas of circles, &s;quares, paralelograms, triangles of different &s;izes and proportions, and may not re&s;t on one image or idea. However this may be, 'tis certain <HI>that</HI> we form the idea of individuals, whenever we u&s;e any general term; <HI>that</HI> we &s;eldom or never can exhau&s;t the&s;e individuals; and <HI>that</HI> tho&s;e, which remain, are only repre&s;ented by means of that habit, by which we recal them, whenever any pre&s;ent occa&s;ion requires it. This then is the nature of our ab&s;tract ideas and general terms; and 'tis after this manner we account for the foregoing para|dox, <HI>that &s;ome ideas are particular in their nature, but general in their repre&s;entation.</HI> A particular idea becomes general by being annex'd to a general term; that is, to a term, which from a cu&s;tomary conjunction has a relation to many other particular ideas, and readily recals them in the imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="58">
THE only difficulty, that can remain on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t be with regard to that cu&s;tom, which &s;o readily recals every par|ticular idea, for which we may have oc|ca&s;ion, and is excited by any word or &s;ound, to which we commonly annex it. The mo&s;t proper method, in my opinion, of giving a &s;atisfactory explication of this act of the mind, is by producing other in&s;tan|ces, which are analogous to it, and other principles, which facilitate its operation. To explain the ultimate cau&s;es of our mental actions is impo&s;&s;ible. 'Tis &s;ufficient, if we can give any &s;atisfactory account of them from experience and analogy.</P>
<P>FIRST then I ob&s;erve, that when we mention any great number, &s;uch as a thou|&s;and, the mind has generally no adequate idea of it, but only a power of producing &s;uch an idea, by its adequate idea of the decimals, under which the number is com|prehended. This imperfection, however in our ideas, is never felt in our rea&s;onings; which &s;eems to be an in&s;tance parallel to the pre&s;ent one of univer&s;al ideas.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, we have &s;everal in&s;tances of habits, which may be reviv'd by one &s;ingle word; as when a per&s;on, who has by rote any periods of a di&s;cour&s;e, or any number
<PB N="48" REF="59">
of ver&s;es, will be put in remembrance of the whole, which he is at a lo&s;s to recollect, by that &s;ingle word or expre&s;&s;ion, with which they begin.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, I believe every one, who ex|amines the &s;ituation of his mind in rea&s;on|ing, will agree with me, that we do not annex di&s;tinct and compleat ideas to every term we make u&s;e of, and that in talking of <HI>government, church, negotiation, conque&s;t,</HI> we &s;eldom &s;pread out in our minds all the &s;imple ideas, of which the&s;e complex ones are compos'd. 'Tis however ob&s;ervable, that notwith&s;tanding this imperfection we may avoid talking non&s;en&s;e on the&s;e &s;ubjects, and may perceive any repugnance among the ideas, as well as if we had a full compre|hen&s;ion of them. Thus if in&s;tead of &s;ay|ing, <HI>that in war the weaker have always recour&s;e to negotiation,</HI> we &s;hou'd &s;ay, <HI>that they have always recour&s;e to conque&s;t,</HI> the cu&s;tom, which we have acquir'd of attri|buting certain relations to ideas, &s;till follows the words, and makes us immediately per|ceive the ab&s;urdity of that propo&s;ition; in the &s;ame manner as one particular idea may &s;erve us in rea&s;oning concerning other ideas, however different from it in &s;everal circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="60">
FOURTHLY, As the individuals are col|lected together, and plac'd under a general term with a view to that re&s;emblance, which they bear to each other, this relation mu&s;t facilitate their entrance in the imagination, and make them be &s;ugge&s;ted more readily upon occa&s;ion. And indeed if we con&s;ider the common progre&s;s of the thought, either in reflection or conver&s;ation, we &s;hall find great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfy'd in this particular. Nothing is more admirable, than the readi|ne&s;s, with which the imagination &s;ugge&s;ts its ideas, and pre&s;ents them at the very in|&s;tant, in which they become nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful. The fancy runs from one end of the univer&s;e to the other in collecting tho&s;e ideas, which belong to any &s;ubject. One would think the whole intellectual world of ideas was at once &s;ubjected to our view, and that we did nothing but pick out &s;uch as were mo&s;t proper for our purpo&s;e. There may not, however, be any pre&s;ent, be&s;ide tho&s;e very ideas, that are thus collected by a kind of magical faculty in the &s;oul, which, tho' it be always mo&s;t perfect in the greate&s;t geniu&s;es, and is properly what we call a genius, is however inexplicable by the utmo&s;t efforts of human under&s;tand|ing.</P>

PERHAPS the&s;e four reflections may help to remove all difficulties to the hypothe&s;is I have propos'd concerning ab&s;tract ideas, &s;o contrary to that, which has hitherto pre|vail'd in philo&s;ophy. But to tell the truth I place my chief confidence in what I have already prov'd concerning the impo&s;&s;ibility of general ideas, according to the common method of explaining them. We mu&s;t cer|tainly &s;eek &s;ome new &s;y&s;tem on this head, and there plainly is none be&s;ide what I have propos'd. If ideas be particular in their na|ture, and at the &s;ame time finite in their number, 'tis only by cu&s;tom they can be|come general in their repre&s;entation, and contain an infinite number of other ideas under them.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this &s;ubject I &s;hall em|ploy the &s;ame principles to explain that <HI>di|&s;tinction of rea&s;on,</HI> which is &s;o much talk'd of, and is &s;o little under&s;tood, in the &s;chools. Of this kind is the di&s;tinction betwixt figure and the body figur'd; motion and the body mov'd. The difficulty of explaining this di&s;tinction ari&s;es from the principle above explain'd, <HI>that all ideas, which are different, are &s;eparable.</HI> For it follows from thence, that if the figure be different from the body, their ideas mu&s;t be &s;eparable as well as di|&s;tingui&s;hable;
<PB N="51" REF="62">
if they be not different, their ideas can neither be &s;eparable nor di&s;tingui&s;h|able. What then is meant by a di&s;tinction of rea&s;on, &s;ince it implies neither a diffe|rence nor &s;eparation?</P>
<P>TO remove this difficulty we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the foregoing explication of ab|&s;tract ideas. 'Tis certain that the mind wou'd never have dream'd of di&s;tingui&s;hing a figure from the body figur'd, as being in reality neither di&s;tingui&s;hable, nor different, nor &s;eparable; did it not ob&s;erve, that even in this &s;implicity there might be contain'd many different re&s;emblances and relations. Thus when a globe of white marble is pre&s;ent|ed, we receive only the impre&s;&s;ion of a white colour di&s;pos'd in a certain form, nor are we able to &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h the colour from the form. But ob&s;erving afterwards a globe of black marble and a cube of white, and comparing them with our former ob|ject, we find two &s;eparate re&s;emblances, in what formerly &s;eem'd, and really is, perfectly in&s;eparable. After a little more practice of this kind, we begin to di&s;tingui&s;h the figure from the colour by a <HI>di&s;tinction of rea&s;on;</HI> that is, we con&s;ider the figure and colour to|gether, &s;ince they are in effect the &s;ame and undi&s;tingui&s;hable; but &s;till view them in
<PB N="52" REF="63">
different a&s;pects, according to the re&s;em|blances, of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible. When we wou'd con&s;ider only the figure of the globe of white marble, we form in reality an idea both of the figure and colour, but tacitly carry our eye to its re&s;emblance with the globe of black marble: And in the &s;ame manner, when we wou'd con&s;ider its colour only, we turn our view to its re&s;emblance with the cube of white marble. By this means we accompany our ideas with a kind of reflection, of which cu&s;tom renders us, in a great mea&s;ure, in&s;en&s;ible. A per&s;on, who de&s;ires us to con&s;ider the figure of a globe of white marble without thinking on its colour, de&s;ires an impo&s;&s;ibility; but his meaning is, that we &s;hou'd con&s;ider the colour and figure together, but &s;till keep in our eye the re&s;emblance to the globe of black marble, or that to any other globe of whatever colour or &s;ub&s;tance.</P>

<P>_WHATEVER has the air of a paradox, and is contrary to the fir&s;t and mo&s;t unprejudic'd notions of mankind is often greedily embrac'd by philo&s;ophers, as &s;hewing the &s;uperiority of their &s;cience, which cou'd di&s;cover opinions &s;o remote from vulgar conception. On the other hand, any thing propos'd to us, which cau&s;es &s;urprize and admiration, gives &s;uch a &s;atisfaction to the mind, that it indulges it|&s;elf in tho&s;e agreeable emotions, and will never be per&s;waded that its plea&s;ure is entirely without foundation. From the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions in philo&s;ophers and their di&s;ci|ples
<PB N="54" REF="65">
ari&s;es that mutual complai&s;ance betwixt them; while the former furni&s;h &s;uch plenty of &s;trange and unaccountable opinions, and the latter &s;o readily believe them. Of this mutual complai&s;ance I cannot give a more evident in&s;tance than in the doctrine of in|finite divi&s;ibility, with the examination of which I &s;hall begin this &s;ubject of the ideas of &s;pace and time.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally allow'd, that the capa|city of the mind is limited, and can never attain a full and adequate conception of in|finity: And tho' it were not allow'd, 'twou'd be &s;ufficiently evident from the plaine&s;t ob|&s;ervation and experience. 'Tis al&s;o obvious, that whatever is capable of being divided <HI>in infinitum,</HI> mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of an infinite num|ber of parts, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et any bounds to the number of parts, without &s;etting bounds at the &s;ame time to the di|vi&s;ion. It requires &s;carce any induction to conclude from hence, that the <HI>idea,</HI> which we form of any finite quality, is not infi|nitely divi&s;ible, but that by proper di&s;tinc|tions and &s;eparations we may run up this idea to inferior ones, which will be per|fectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible. In rejecting the infinite capacity of the mind, we &s;up|po&s;e it may arrive at an end in the divi&s;ion
<PB N="55" REF="66">
of its ideas; nor are there any po&s;&s;ible means of evading the evidence of this conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore certain, that the imagi|nation reaches a <HI>minimum,</HI> and may rai&s;e up to it&s;elf an idea, of which it cannot con|ceive any &s;ub-divi&s;ion, and which cannot be dimini&s;hed without a total annihilation. When you tell me of the thou&s;andth and ten thou&s;andth part of a grain of &s;and, I have a di&s;tinct idea of the&s;e numbers and of their different proportions; but the images, which I form in my mind to repre&s;ent the things them&s;elves, are nothing different from each other, nor inferior to that image, by which I repre&s;ent the grain of &s;and it&s;elf, which is &s;uppos'd &s;o va&s;tly to exceed them. What con&s;i&s;ts of parts is di&s;tingui&s;hable into them, and what is di&s;tingui&s;hable is &s;epa|rable. But whatever we may imagine of the thing, the idea of a grain of &s;and is not di&s;tingui&s;hable, nor &s;eparable into twenty, much le&s;s into a thou&s;and, ten thou&s;and, or an infinite number of different ideas.</P>
<P>'TIS the &s;ame ca&s;e with the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es as with the ideas of the ima|gination. Put a &s;pot of ink upon paper, fix your eye upon that &s;pot, and retire to &s;uch a di&s;tance, that at la&s;t you lo&s;e &s;ight of it; 'tis plain, that the moment before it
<PB N="56" REF="67">
vani&s;h'd the image or impre&s;&s;ion was per|fectly indivi&s;ible. 'Tis not for want of rays of light &s;triking on our eyes, that the mi|nute parts of di&s;tant bodies convey not any &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion; but becau&s;e they are re|mov'd beyond that di&s;tance, at which their impre&s;&s;ions were reduc'd to a <HI>minimum,</HI> and were incapable of any farther diminution. A micro&s;cope or tele&s;cope, which renders them vi&s;ible, produces not any new rays of light, but only &s;preads tho&s;e, which always flow'd from them; and by that means both gives parts to impre&s;&s;ions, which to the naked eye appear &s;imple and uncompounded, and advances to a <HI>minimum,</HI> what was for|merly imperceptible.</P>
<P>WE may hence di&s;cover the error of the common opinion, that the capacity of the mind is limited on both &s;ides, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the imagination to form an adequate idea, of what goes beyond a cer|tain degree of minutene&s;s as well as of great|ne&s;s. Nothing can be more minute, than &s;ome ideas, which we form in the fancy; and images, which appear to the &s;en&s;es; &s;ince there are ideas and images perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible. The only defect of our &s;en&s;es is, that they give us di&s;propor|tion'd images of things, and repre&s;ent as mi|nute
<PB N="57" REF="68">
and uncompounded what is really great and compos'd of a va&s;t number of parts. This mi&s;take we are not &s;en&s;ible of; but taking the impre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e minute ob|jects, which appear to the &s;en&s;es, to be equal or nearly equal to the objects, and finding by rea&s;on, that there are other objects va&s;tly more minute, we too ha&s;tily conclude, that the&s;e are inferior to any idea of our imagi|nation or impre&s;&s;ion of our &s;en&s;es. This however is certain, that we can form ideas, which &s;hall be no greater than the &s;malle&s;t atom of the animal &s;pirits of an in&s;ect a thou&s;and times le&s;s than a mite: And we ought rather to conclude, that the difficulty lies in enlarging our conceptions &s;o much as to form a ju&s;t notion of a mite, or even of an in&s;ect a thou&s;and times le&s;s than a mite. For in order to form a ju&s;t notion of the&s;e animals, we mu&s;t have a di&s;tinct idea repre|&s;enting every part of them; which, accord|ing to the &s;y&s;tem of infinite divi&s;ibility, is utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and according to that of indivi&s;ible parts or atoms, is extremely diffi|cult, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t number and mul|tiplicity of the&s;e parts.</P>

<P>WHerever ideas are adequate repre&s;en|tations of objects, the relations, con|tradictions and agreements of the ideas are all applicable to the objects; and this we may in general ob&s;erve to be the foundation of all human knowledge. But our ideas are ade|quate repre&s;entations of the mo&s;t minute partsof exten&s;ion; and thro' whatever divi|&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions we may &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e parts to be arriv'd at, they can never become inferior to &s;ome ideas, which we form. The plain con&s;equence is, that whatever <HI>appears</HI> impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory upon the com|pari&s;on of the&s;e ideas, mu&s;t be <HI>really</HI> im|po&s;&s;ible and contradictory, without any far|ther excu&s;e or eva&s;ion.</P>
<P>EVERY thing capable of being infinitely divided contains an infinite number of parts; otherwi&s;e the divi&s;ion would be &s;topt &s;hort by the indivi&s;ible parts, which we &s;hould immediately arrive at. If therefore any fi|nite exten&s;ion be infinitely divi&s;ible, it can be no contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that a finite exten&s;ion contains an infinite number of
<PB N="59" REF="70">
parts: And <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if it be a contradic|tion to &s;uppo&s;e, that a finite exten&s;ion con|tains an infinite number of parts, no finite exten&s;ion can be infinitely divi&s;ible. But that this latter &s;uppo&s;ition is ab&s;urd, I ea&s;ily con|vince my&s;elf by the con&s;ideration of my clear ideas. I fir&s;t take the lea&s;t idea I can form of a part of exten&s;ion, and being certain that there is nothing more minute than this idea, I conclude, that whatever I di&s;cover by its means mu&s;t be a real quality of exten&s;ion. I then repeat this idea once, twice, thrice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and find the compound idea of exten|&s;ion, ari&s;ing from its repetition, always to augment, and become double, triple, qua|druple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till at la&s;t it &s;wells up to a con&s;i|derable bulk, greater or &s;maller, in propor|tion as I repeat more or le&s;s the &s;ame idea. When I &s;top in the addition of parts, the idea of exten&s;ion cea&s;es to augment; and were I to carry on the addition <HI>in infinitum,</HI> I clearly perceive, that the idea of exten&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o become infinite. Upon the whole, I con|clude, that the idea of an infinite number of parts is individually the &s;ame idea with that of an infinite exten&s;ion; that no fi|nite exten&s;ion is capable of containing an infinite number of parts; and con&s;equently
<PB N="60" REF="71">
that no finite exten&s;ion is infinitely divi|&s;ible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been objected to me, that infinite divi&s;ibility &s;up|po&s;es only an infinite number of <HI>proportional</HI> not of <HI>aliquot</HI> parts, and that an infinite number of proportional parts does not form an infinite exten&s;ion. But this di&s;tinction is entirely frivolous. Whether the&s;e parts be call'd <HI>aliquot</HI> or <HI>propor|tional,</HI> they cannot be inferior to tho&s;e minute parts we con|ceive; and therefore cannot form a le&s;s exten&s;ion by their conjunction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I MAY &s;ubjoin another argument propos'd by a noted author <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;. <HI>Malezic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE>, which &s;eems to me very &s;trong and beautiful. 'Tis evident, that ex|i&s;tence in it&s;elf belongs only to unity, and is never applicable to number, but on ac|count of the unites, of which the number is compos'd. Twenty men may be &s;aid to exi&s;t; but 'tis only becau&s;e one, two, three, four, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are exi&s;tent; and if you deny the exi&s;tence of the latter, that of the former falls of cour&s;e. 'Tis therefore utterly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e any number to exi&s;t, and yet deny the exi&s;tence of unites; and as exten&s;ion is always a number, according to the common &s;entiment of metaphy&s;icians, and never re|&s;olves it&s;elf into any unite or indivi&s;ible quan|tity, it follows, that exten&s;ion can never at all exi&s;t. 'Tis in vain to reply, that any de|terminate quantity of exten&s;ion is an unite;
<PB N="61" REF="72">
but &s;uch-a-one as admits of an infinite number of fractions, and is inexhau&s;tible in its &s;ub-divi&s;ions. For by the &s;ame rule the&s;e twenty men <HI>may be con&s;ider'd as an unite.</HI> The whole globe of the earth, nay the whole univer&s;e <HI>may be con&s;ider'd as an unite.</HI> That term of unity is merely a fic|titious denomination, which the mind may apply to any quantity of objects it collects together; nor can &s;uch an unity any more exi&s;t alone than number can, as being in reality a true number. But the unity, which can exi&s;t alone, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to that of all number, is of another kind, and mu&s;t be perfectly indivi&s;ible, and incapable of being re&s;olved into any le&s;&s;er unity.</P>
<P>ALL this rea&s;oning takes place with re|gard to time; along with an additional ar|gument, which it may be proper to take notice of. 'Tis a property in&s;eparable from time, and which in a manner con&s;titutes its e&s;&s;ence, that each of its parts &s;ucceeds an|other, and that none of them, however con|tiguous, can ever be co-exi&s;tent. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the year 1737. cannot con|cur with the pre&s;ent year 1738. every mo|ment mu&s;t be di&s;tinct from, and po&s;terior or antecedent to another. 'Tis certain then,
<PB N="62" REF="73">
that time, as it exi&s;ts, mu&s;t be compos'd of indivi&s;ible moments. For if in time we could never arrive at an end of divi&s;ion, and if each moment, as it &s;ucceeds another, were not perfectly &s;ingle and indivi&s;ible, there would be an infinite number of co-exi&s;tent moments, or parts of time; which I be|lieve will be allow'd to be an arrant contra|diction.</P>
<P>THE infinite divi&s;ibility of &s;pace implies that of time, as is evident from the nature of motion. If the latter, therefore, be im|po&s;&s;ible, the former mu&s;t be equally &s;o.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not but it will readily be al|low'd by the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate defender of the doctrine of infinite divi&s;ibility, that the&s;e argu|ments are difficulties, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any an&s;wer to them which will be perfect|ly clear and &s;atisfactory. But here we may ob&s;erve, that nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than this cu&s;tom of calling a <HI>difficulty</HI> what pretends to be a <HI>demon&s;tration,</HI> and endea|vouring by that means to elude its force and evidence. 'Tis not in demon&s;trations as in probabilities, that difficulties can take place, and one argument counter-ballance another, and dimini&s;h its authority. A demon&s;tra|tion, if ju&s;t, admits of no oppo&s;ite difficul|ty; and if not ju&s;t, 'tis a mere &s;ophi&s;m, and
<PB N="63" REF="74">
con&s;equently can never be a difficulty. 'Tis either irre&s;i&s;tible, or has no manner of force. To talk therefore of objections and replies, and ballancing of arguments in &s;uch a que|&s;tion as this, is to confe&s;s, either that human rea&s;on is nothing but a play of words, or that the per&s;on him&s;elf, who talks &s;o, has not a capacity equal to &s;uch &s;ubjects. De|mon&s;trations may be difficult to be compre|hended, becau&s;e of the ab&s;tractedne&s;s of the &s;ubject; but can never have any &s;uch difficul|ties as will weaken their authority, when once they are comprehended.</P>
<P>'TIS true, mathematicians are wont to &s;ay, that there are here equally &s;trong ar|guments on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and that the doctrine of indivi&s;ible points is al&s;o liable to unan&s;werable objections. Be|fore I examine the&s;e arguments and objections in detail, I will here take them in a body, and endeavour by a &s;hort and deci&s;ive rea|&s;on to prove at once, that 'tis utterly im|po&s;&s;ible they can have any ju&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>'TIS an e&s;tabli&s;h'd maxim in metaphy|&s;ics, <HI>That whatever the mind clearly conceives includes the idea of po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence,</HI> or in other words, <HI>that nothing we imagine is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> We can form the idea of a golden mountain, and from thence conclude
<PB N="64" REF="75">
that &s;uch a mountain may actually exi&s;t. We can form no idea of a mountain with|out a valley, and therefore regard it as im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>NOW 'tis certain we have an idea of ex|ten&s;ion; for otherwi&s;e why do we talk and rea&s;on concerning it? 'Tis likewi&s;e certain, that this idea, as conceiv'd by the imagina|tion, tho' divi&s;ible into parts or inferior ideas, is not infinitely divi&s;ible, nor con&s;i&s;ts of an in|finite number of parts: For that exceeds the comprehen&s;ion of our limited capacities. Here then is an idea of exten&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ts of parts or inferior ideas, that are perfectly indivi&s;ible: con&s;equently this idea implies no contradiction: con&s;equently 'tis po&s;&s;ible for exten&s;ion really to exi&s;t conformable to it: and con&s;equently all the arguments employ'd again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of mathematical points are mere &s;chola&s;tick quibbles, and unwor|thy of our attention.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;equences we may carry one &s;tep farther, and conclude that all the pre|tended demon&s;trations for the infinite divi&s;i|bility of exten&s;ion are equally &s;ophi&s;tical; &s;ince 'tis certain the&s;e demon&s;trations cannot be ju&s;t without proving the impo&s;&s;ibility of mathematical points; which 'tis an evident ab&s;urdity to pretend to.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the other qualities of our ideas of &s;pace and time.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO di&s;covery cou'd have been made more happily for deciding all con|trover&s;ies concerning ideas, than that above|mention'd, that impre&s;&s;ions always take the precedency of them, and that every idea, with which the imagination is furni&s;h'd, fir&s;t makes its appearance in a corre&s;pondent im|pre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e latter perceptions are all &s;o clear and evident, that they admit of no controver&s;y; tho' many of our ideas are &s;o ob&s;cure, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible even for the mind, which forms them, to tell ex|actly their nature and compo&s;ition. Let us apply this principle, in order to di&s;cover far|ther the nature of our ideas of &s;pace and time</P>
<P>UPON opening my eyes, and turning them to the &s;urrounding objects, I perceive many vi&s;ible bodies; and upon &s;hutting them again, and con&s;idering the di&s;tance betwixt the&s;e bodies, I acquire the idea of exten&s;ion. As every idea is deriv'd from &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, which is exactly &s;imilar to it, the impre&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="66" REF="77">
&s;imilar to this idea of exten&s;ion, mu&s;t either be &s;ome &s;en&s;ations deriv'd from the &s;ight, or &s;ome internal impre&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>OUR internal impre&s;&s;ions are our pa&s;&s;i|ons, emotions, de&s;ires and aver&s;ions; none of which, I believe, will ever be a&s;&s;erted to be the model, from which the idea of &s;pace is deriv'd. There remains therefore nothing but the &s;en&s;es, which can convey to us this original impre&s;&s;ion. Now what impre&s;&s;ion do our &s;en&s;es here convey to us? This is the principal que&s;tion, and decides without ap|peal concerning the nature of the idea.</P>
<P>THE table before me is alone &s;ufficient by its view to give me the idea of ex|ten&s;ion. This idea, then, is borrow'd from, and repre&s;ents &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, which this moment appears to the &s;en&s;es. But my &s;en&s;es convey to me only the impre&s;&s;ions of colour'd points, di&s;pos'd in a certain manner. If the eye is &s;en&s;ible of any thing farther, I de&s;ire it may be pointed out to me. But if it be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew any thing far|ther, we may conclude with certainty, that the idea of exten&s;ion is nothing but a copy of the&s;e colour'd points, and of the manner of their appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="78">
SUPPOSE that in the extended object, or compo&s;ition of colour'd points, from which we fir&s;t receiv'd the idea of exten&s;ion, the points were of a purple colour; it follows, that in every repetition of that idea we wou'd not only place the points in the &s;ame order with re&s;pect to each other, but al&s;o be&s;tow on them that preci&s;e colour, with which alone we are acquainted. But afterwards having experience of the other colours of violet, green, red, white, black, and of all the different compo&s;itions of the&s;e, and find|ing a re&s;emblance in the di&s;po&s;ition of co|lour'd points, of which they are compos'd, we omit the peculiarities of colour, as far as po&s;&s;ible, and found an ab&s;tract idea mere|ly on that di&s;po&s;ition of points, or manner of appearance, in which they agree. Nay even when the re&s;emblance is carry'd be|yond the objects of one &s;en&s;e, and the im|pre&s;&s;ions of touch are found to be &s;imilar to tho&s;e of &s;ight in the di&s;po&s;ition of their parts; this does not hinder the ab&s;tract idea from repre&s;enting both, upon account of their re&s;emblance. All ab&s;tract ideas are really nothing but particular ones, con&s;i|der'd in a certain light; but being annexed to general terms, they are able to repre&s;ent a va&s;t variety, and to comprehend objects,

which, as they are alike in &s;ome particu|lars, are in others va&s;tly wide of each other.</P>
<P>THE idea of time, being deriv'd from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our perceptions of every kind, ideas as well as impre&s;&s;ions, and im|pre&s;&s;ions of reflection as well as of &s;en&s;ation, will afford us an in&s;tance of an ab&s;tract idea, which comprehends a &s;till greater variety than that of &s;pace, and yet is repre&s;ented in the fancy by &s;ome particular individual idea of a determinate quantity and quality.</P>
<P>As 'tis from the di&s;po&s;ition of vi&s;ible and tangible objects we receive the idea of &s;pace, &s;o from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas and impre&s;|&s;ions we form the idea of time, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for time alone ever to make its ap|pearance, or be taken notice of by the mind. A man in a &s;ound &s;leep, or &s;trongly occu|py'd with one thought, is in&s;en&s;ible of time; and according as his perceptions &s;ucceed each other with greater or le&s;s rapidity, the &s;ame duration appears longer or &s;horter to his imagination. It has been remark'd by a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI></NOTE> great philo&s;opher, that our perceptions have certain bounds in this particular, which are fix'd by the original nature and con&s;titu|tion of the mind, and beyond which no in|fluence
<PB N="69" REF="80">
of external objects on the &s;en&s;es is ever able to ha&s;ten or retard our thought. If you wheel about a burning coal with rapidity, it will pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es an image of a circle of fire; nor will there &s;eem to be any interval of time betwixt its revolu|tions; meerly becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for our perceptions to &s;ucceed each other with the &s;ame rapidity, that motion may be commu|nicated to external objects. Wherever we have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ive perceptions, we have no notion of time, even tho' there be a real &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the objects. From the&s;e phae|nomina, as well as from many others, we may conclude, that time cannot make its ap|pearance to the mind, either alone, or at|tended with a &s;teady unchangeable object, but is always di&s;cover'd by &s;ome <HI>perceivable</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of changeable objects.</P>
<P>To confirm this we may add the follow|ing argument, which to me &s;eems perfectly deci&s;ive and convincing. 'Tis evident, that time or duration con&s;i&s;ts of different parts: For otherwi&s;e we cou'd not conceive a longer or &s;horter duration. 'Tis al&s;o evident, that the&s;e parts are not co-exi&s;tent: For that quality of the co-exi&s;tence of parts belongs to exten&s;ion, and is what di&s;tingui&s;hes it from duration. Now as time is compos'd
<PB N="70" REF="81">
of parts, that are not co-exi&s;tent; an un|changeable object, &s;ince it produces none but co-exi&s;tent impre&s;&s;ions, produces none that can give us the idea of time; and con&s;e|quently that idea mu&s;t be deriv'd from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of changeable objects, and time in its fir&s;t appearance can never be &s;ever'd from &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAVING therefore found, that time in its fir&s;t appearance to the mind is always conjoin'd with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of changeable ob|jects, and that otherwi&s;e it can never fall under our notice, we mu&s;t now examine whether it can be <HI>conceiv'd</HI> without our con|ceiving any &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects, and whether it can alone form a di&s;tinct idea in the ima|gination.</P>
<P>IN order to know whither any objects, which are join'd in impre&s;&s;ion, be &s;eparable in idea, we need only con&s;ider, if they be different from each other; in which ca&s;e, 'tis plain they may be conceiv'd apart. Every thing, that is different, it di&s;tingui&s;hable; and every thing, that is di&s;tingui&s;hable, may be &s;eparated, according to the maxims above|explain'd. If on the contrary they be not different, they are not di&s;tingui&s;hable; and if they be not di&s;tingui&s;hable, they cannot be &s;eparated. But this is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="82">
with re&s;pect to time, compar'd with our &s;ucce&s;&s;ive perceptions. The idea of time is not deriv'd from a particular impre&s;&s;ion mix'd up with others, and plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable from them; but ari&s;es altogether from the manner, in which impre&s;&s;ions appear to the mind, without making one of the number. Five notes play'd on a flute give us the impre&s;&s;ion and idea of time; tho' time be not a &s;ixth impre&s;&s;ion, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the hearing or any other of the &s;en&s;es. Nor is it a &s;ixth impre&s;&s;ion, which the mind by reflection finds in it&s;elf. The&s;e five &s;ounds making their appearance in this par|ticular manner, excite no emotion in the mind, nor produce an affection of any kind, which being ob&s;erv'd by it can give ri&s;e to a new idea. For <HI>that</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to produce a new idea of reflection, nor can the mind, by revolving over a thou&s;and times all its ideas of &s;en&s;ation, ever extract from them any new original idea, unle&s;s nature has &s;o fram'd its faculties, that it feels &s;ome new original impre&s;&s;ion ari&s;e from &s;uch a con|templation. But here it only takes notice of the <HI>manner,</HI> in which the different &s;ounds make their appearance; and that it may af|terwards con&s;ider without con&s;idering the&s;e particular &s;ounds, but may conjoin it with
<PB N="72" REF="83">
any other objects. The ideas of &s;ome objects it certainly mu&s;t have, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for it without the&s;e ideas ever to arrive at any conception of time; which &s;ince it appears not as any primary di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion, can plainly be nothing but different ideas, or im|pre&s;&s;ions, or objects di&s;pos'd in a certain man|ner, that is, &s;ucceeding each other.</P>
<P>I KNOW there are &s;ome who pretend, that the idea of duration is applicable in a proper &s;en&s;e to objects, which are perfectly unchangeable; and this I take to be the com|mon opinion of philo&s;ophers as well as of the vulgar. But to be convinc'd of its fal&s;e|hood we need but reflect on the foregoing conclu&s;ion, that the idea of duration is al|ways deriv'd from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of change|able objects, and can never be convey'd to the mind by any thing &s;tedfa&s;t and unchange|able. For it inevitably follows from thence, that &s;ince the idea of duration cannot be de|riv'd from &s;uch an object, it can never in any propriety or exactne&s;s be apply'd to it, nor can any thing unchangeable be ever &s;aid to have duration. Ideas always repre&s;ent the objects or impre&s;&s;ions, from which they are deriv'd, and can never without a fiction re|pre&s;ent or be apply'd to any other. By what fiction we apply the idea of time, even to
<PB N="73" REF="84">
what is unchangeable, and &s;uppo&s;e, as is common, that duration is a mea&s;ure of re&s;t as well as of motion, we &s;hall con&s;ider <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE> after|wards.</P>
<P>THERE is another very deci&s;ive argu|ment, which e&s;tabli&s;hes the pre&s;ent doctrine concerning our ideas of &s;pace and time, and is founded only on that &s;imple principle, <HI>that our ideas of them are compounded of parts, which are indivi&s;ible.</HI> This argument may be worth the examining.</P>
<P>EVERY idea, that is di&s;tingui&s;hable, being al&s;o &s;eparable, let us take one of tho&s;e &s;imple indivi&s;ible ideas, of which the compound one of <HI>exten&s;ion</HI> is form'd, and &s;eparating it from all others, and con&s;idering it apart, let us form a judgment of its nature and quali|ties.</P>
<P>'TIS plain it is not the idea of exten&s;ion. For the idea of exten&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of parts; and this idea, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition, is perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible. Is it there|fore nothing? That is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. For as the compound idea of exten&s;ion, which is real, is compos'd of &s;uch ideas; were the&s;e &s;o many non-entities, there wou'd be a real exi&s;tence compos'd of non-entities; which is ab&s;urd. Here therefore I mu&s;t a&s;k,
<PB N="74" REF="85">
<HI>What is our idea of a &s;imple and indivi&s;ible point?</HI> No wonder if my an&s;wer appear &s;omewhat new, &s;ince the que&s;tion it&s;elf has &s;carce ever yet been thought of. We are wont to di&s;pute concerning the nature of mathematical points, but &s;eldom concerning the nature of their ideas.</P>
<P>THE idea of &s;pace is convey'd to the mind by two &s;en&s;es, the &s;ight and touch; nor does any thing ever appear extended, that is not either vi&s;ible or tangible. That compound impre&s;&s;ion, which repre&s;ents ex|ten&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal le&s;&s;er impre&s;&s;ions, that are indivi&s;ible to the eye or feeling, and may be call'd impre&s;&s;ions of atoms or cor|pu&s;cles endow'd with colour and &s;olidity. But this is not all. 'Tis not only requi&s;ite, that the&s;e atoms &s;hou'd be colour'd or tan|gible, in order to di&s;cover them&s;elves to our &s;en&s;es; 'tis al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hou'd pre&s;erve the idea of their colour or tangibility in or|der to comprehend them by our imagina|tion. There is nothing but the idea of their colour or tangibility, which can render them conceivable by the mind. Upon the re|moval of the ideas of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities, they are utterly annihilated to the thought or imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">
NOW &s;uch as the parts are, &s;uch is the whole. If a point be not con&s;ider'd as colour'd or tangible, it can convey to us no idea; and con&s;equently the idea of exten|&s;ion, which is compos'd of the ideas of the&s;e points, can never po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t. But if the idea of exten&s;ion really can exi&s;t, as we are con&s;cious it does, its parts mu&s;t al&s;o exi&s;t; and in order to that, mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as colour'd or tangible. We have therefore no idea of &s;pace or exten&s;ion, but when we regard it as an object either of our &s;ight or feeling.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;oning will prove, that the indivi&s;ible moments of time mu&s;t be fill'd with &s;ome real object or exi&s;tence, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ion forms the duration, and makes it be conceivable by the mind.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Objections an&s;wer'd.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR &s;y&s;tem concerning &s;pace and time con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, which are in|timately connected together. The fir&s;t de|pends on this chain of rea&s;oning. The ca|pacity of the mind is not infinite; con&s;e|quently no idea of exten&s;ion or duration con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="76" REF="87">
of an infinite number of parts or infe|rior ideas, but of a finite number, and the&s;e &s;imple and indivi&s;ible: 'Tis therefore po&s;|&s;ible for &s;pace and time to exi&s;t con|formable to this idea: And if it be po&s;&s;ible, 'tis certain they actually do exi&s;t conform|able to it; &s;ince their infinite divi&s;ibility is utterly impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory.</P>
<P>THE other part of our &s;y&s;tem is a con|&s;equence of this. The parts, into which the ideas of &s;pace and time re&s;olve them&s;elves, become at la&s;t indivi&s;ible; and the&s;e indivi|&s;ible parts, being nothing in them&s;elves, are inconceivable when not fill'd with &s;omething real and exi&s;tent. The ideas of &s;pace and time are therefore no &s;eparate or di&s;tinct ideas, but merely tho&s;e of the manner or order, in which objects exi&s;t: Or, in other words, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive either a vacuum and exten&s;ion without matter, or a time, when there was no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or change in any real exi&s;tence. The intimate connexion betwixt the&s;e parts of our &s;y&s;tem is the rea&s;on why we &s;hall examine together the objections, which have been urg'd again&s;t both of them, beginning with tho&s;e again&s;t the finite di|vi&s;ibility of exten&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE fir&s;t of the&s;e objections, which I &s;hall take notice of, is more proper to prove
<PB N="77" REF="88">
this connexion and dependance of the one part upon the other, than to de&s;troy either of them. It has often been maintain'd in the &s;chools, that exten&s;ion mu&s;t be divi&s;ible, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of mathe|matical points is ab&s;urd; and that &s;y&s;tem is ab&s;urd, becau&s;e a mathematical point is a non-entity, and con&s;equently can never by its conjunction with others form a real ex|i&s;tence. This wou'd be perfectly deci&s;ive, were there no medium betwixt the infinite divi&s;ibility of matter, and the non-entity of mathematical points. But there is evidently a medium, <HI>viz.</HI> the be&s;towing a colour or &s;olidity on the&s;e points; and the ab&s;urdity of both the extremes is a demon&s;tration of the truth and reality of this medium. The &s;y&s;tem of <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> points, which is another medium, is too ab&s;urd to need a refutation. A real exten&s;ion, &s;uch as a phy&s;ical point is &s;uppos'd to be, can never exi&s;t without parts, different from each other; and where|ever objects are different, they are di&s;tingui&s;h|able and &s;eparable by the imagination.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd objection is deriv'd from the nece&s;&s;ity there wou'd be of <HI>penetration,</HI> if exten&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of mathematical points. A &s;imple and indivi&s;ible atom, that touches another, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily penetrate it; for
<PB N="78" REF="89">
'tis impo&s;&s;ible it can touch it by its external parts, from the very &s;uppo&s;ition of its per|fect &s;implicity, which excludes all parts. It mu&s;t therefore touch it intimately, and in its whole e&s;&s;ence, <HI>&s;ecundum &s;e, tota, &amp; tota|liter;</HI> which is the very definition of pene|tration. But penetration is impo&s;&s;ible: Ma|thematical points are of con&s;equence equally impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I ANSWER this objection by &s;ub&s;tituting a ju&s;ter idea of penetration. Suppo&s;e two bodies containing no void within their cir|cumference, to approach each other, and to unite in &s;uch a manner that the body, which re&s;ults from their union, is no more extend|ed than either of them; 'tis this we mu&s;t mean when we talk of penetration. But 'tis evident this penetration is nothing but the annihilation of one of the&s;e bodies, and the pre&s;ervation of the other, without our being able to di&s;tingui&s;h particularly which is pre&s;erv'd and which annihilated. Before the approach we have the idea of two bo|dies. After it we have the idea only of one. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to pre&s;erve any notion of difference betwixt two bodies of the &s;ame nature exi&s;ting in the &s;ame place at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="90">
TAKING then penetration in this &s;en&s;e, for the annihilation of one body upon its approach to another, I a&s;k any one, if he &s;ees a nece&s;&s;ity, that a colour'd or tangi|ble point &s;hou'd be annihilated upon the ap|proach of another colour'd or tangible point? On the contrary, does he not evidently per|ceive, that from the union of the&s;e points there re&s;ults an object, which is compounded and divi&s;ible, and may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into two parts, of which each pre&s;erves its exi|&s;tence di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, notwith&s;tanding its contiguity to the other? Let him aid his fancy by conceiving the&s;e points to be of different colours, the better to prevent their coalition and confu&s;ion. A blue and a red point may &s;urely lie contiguous without any penetration or annihilation. For if they cannot, what po&s;&s;ibly can become of them? Whether &s;hall the red or the blue be anni|hilated? Or if the&s;e colours unite into one, what new colour will they produce by their union?</P>
<P>WHAT chiefly gives ri&s;e to the&s;e ob|jections, and at the &s;ame time renders it &s;o difficult to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to them, is the natural infirmity and un&s;teadine&s;s both of our imagination and &s;en&s;es, when em|ploy'd on &s;uch minute objects. Put a &s;pot
<PB N="80" REF="91">
of ink upon paper, and retire to &s;uch a di|&s;tance, that the &s;pot becomes altogether in|vi&s;ible; you will find, that upon your re|turn and nearer approach the &s;pot fir&s;t be|comes vi&s;ible by &s;hort intervals; and after|wards becomes always vi&s;ible; and afterwards acquires only a new force in its colouring without augmenting its bulk; and after|wards, when it has encreas'd to &s;uch a de|gree as to be really extended, 'tis &s;till diffi|cult for the imagination to break it into its component parts, becau&s;e of the unea&s;ine&s;s it finds in the conception of &s;uch a minute ob|ject as a &s;ingle point. This infirmity af|fects mo&s;t of our rea&s;onings on the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject, and makes it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer in an intelligible manner, and in proper expre&s;&s;ions, many que&s;tions which may ari&s;e concerning it.</P>
<P N="3">III. THERE have been many objections drawn from the <HI>mathematics</HI> again&s;t the indi|vi&s;ibility of the parts of exten&s;ion; tho' at fir&s;t &s;ight that &s;cience &s;eems rather favourable to the pre&s;ent doctrine; and if it be contrary in its <HI>demon&s;trations,</HI> 'tis perfectly conformable in its <HI>definitions.</HI> My pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s then mu&s;t be to defend the definitions, and refute the demon&s;trations.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="92">
A SURFACE is <HI>defin'd</HI> to be length and breadth without depth: A line to be length without breadth or depth: A point to be what has neither length, breadth nor depth. 'Tis evident that all this is perfectly unin|telligible upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition than that of the compo&s;ition of exten&s;ion by in|divi&s;ible points or atoms. How el&s;e cou'd any thing exi&s;t without length, without breadth, or without depth?</P>
<P>TWO different an&s;wers, I find, have been made to this argument; neither of which is in my opinion &s;atisfactory. The fir&s;t is, that the objects of geometry, tho&s;e &s;urfaces, lines and points, who&s;e proportions and po&s;itions it examines, are mere ideas in the mind; and not only never did, but never can exi&s;t in nature. They never did exi&s;t; for no one will pretend to draw a line or make a &s;urface entirely conformable to the defini|tion: They never can exi&s;t; for we may produce demon&s;trations from the&s;e very ideas to prove, that they are impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT can any thing be imagin'd more ab|&s;urd and contradictory than this rea&s;oning? Whatever can be conceiv'd by a clear and di&s;tinct idea nece&s;&s;arily implies the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of exi&s;tence; and he who pretends to prove the impo&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence by
<PB N="82" REF="93">
any argument deriv'd from the clear idea, in reality a&s;&s;erts, that we have no clear idea of it, becau&s;e we have a clear idea. 'Tis in vain to &s;earch for a contradiction in any thing that is di&s;tinctly conceiv'd by the mind. Did it imply any contradiction, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible it cou'd ever be conceiv'd.</P>
<P>THERE is therefore no medium betwixt allowing at lea&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of indivi&s;ible points, and denying their idea; and 'tis on this latter principle, that the &s;econd an&s;wer to the foregoing argument is founded. It has been <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Art de pen&s;er.</NOTE> pretended, that tho' it be impo&s;|&s;ible to conceive a length without any breadth, yet by an ab&s;traction without a &s;eparation, we can con&s;ider the one without regarding the other; in the &s;ame manner as we may think of the length of the way betwixt two towns, and overlook its breadth. The length is in&s;eparable from the breadth both in na|ture and in our minds; but this excludes not a partial con&s;ideration, and a <HI>di&s;tinction of rea&s;on,</HI> after the manner above explain'd.</P>
<P>IN re&s;uting this an&s;wer I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the argument, which I have already &s;uf|ficiently explain'd, that if it be impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to arrive at a <HI>minimum</HI> in its ideas, its capacity mu&s;t be infinite, in order
<PB N="83" REF="94">
to comprehend the infinite number of parts, of which its idea of any exten&s;ion wou'd be compos'd. I &s;hall here endeavour to find &s;ome new ab&s;urdities in this rea|&s;oning.</P>
<P>A SURFACE terminates a &s;olid; a line terminates a &s;urface; a point terminates a line; but I a&s;&s;ert, that if the <HI>ideas</HI> of a point, line or &s;urface were not indivi&s;ible, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible we &s;hou'd ever conceive the&s;e termi|nations. For let the&s;e ideas be &s;uppos'd in|finitely divi&s;ible; and then let the fancy en|deavour to fix it&s;elf on the idea of the la&s;t &s;urface, line or point; it immediately finds this idea to break into parts; and upon its &s;eizing the la&s;t of the&s;e parts, it lo&s;es its hold by a new divi&s;ion, and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum,</HI> without any po&s;&s;ibility of its arriving at a concluding idea. The number of fractions bring it no nearer the la&s;t divi&s;ion, than the fir&s;t idea it form'd. Every particle eludes the gra&s;p by a new fraction; like quick|&s;ilver, when we endeavour to &s;eize it. But as in fact there mu&s;t be &s;omething, which terminates the idea of every finite quantity; and as this terminating idea cannot it&s;elf con&s;i&s;t of parts or inferior ideas; otherwi&s;e it wou'd be the la&s;t of its parts, which fi|ni&s;h'd the idea, and &s;o on; this is a clear
<PB N="84" REF="95">
proof, that the ideas of &s;urfaces, lines and points admit not of any divi&s;ion; tho&s;e of &s;urfaces in depth; of lines in breadth and depth; and of points in any dimen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;choolmen</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the force of this argument, that &s;ome of them maintain'd, that nature has mix'd among tho&s;e particles of matter, which are divi&s;ible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> a number of mathematical points, in order to give a termination to bodies; and others eluded the force of this rea&s;on|ing by a heap of unintelligible cavils and di&s;tinctions. Both the&s;e adver&s;aries equally yield the victory. A man who hides him|&s;elf, confe&s;&s;es as evidently the &s;uperiority of his enemy, as another, who fairly delivers his arms.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, that the definitions of mathematics de&s;troy the pretended demon|&s;trations; and that if we have the idea of indivi&s;ible points, lines and &s;urfaces conform|able to the definition, their exi&s;tence is cer|tainly po&s;&s;ible: but if we have no &s;uch idea, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can ever conceive the ter|mination of any figure; without which con|ception there can be no geometrical demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>BUT I go farther, and maintain, that none of the&s;e demon&s;trations can have &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="85" REF="96">
weight to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a principle, as this of infinite divi&s;ibility; and that becau&s;e with regard to &s;uch minute objects, they are not properly demon&s;trations, being built on ideas, which are not exact, and maxims, which are not exact, and maxims, which are not preci&s;ely true. When geo|metry decides any thing concerning the pro|portions of quantity, we ought not to look for the utmo&s;t <HI>preci&s;ion</HI> and exactne&s;s. None of its proofs extend &s;o far. It takes the di|men&s;ions and proportions of figures ju&s;tly; but roughly, and with &s;ome liberty. Its errors are never con&s;iderable; nor wou'd it err at all, did it not a&s;pire to &s;uch an ab&s;olute perfection.</P>
<P>I FIRST a&s;k mathematicians, what they mean when they &s;ay one line or &s;urface is EQUAL to, or GREATER, or LESS than another? Let any of them give an an&s;wer, to whatever &s;ect he belongs, and whether he maintains the compo&s;ition of exten&s;ion by indivi&s;ible points, or by quantities divi|&s;ible <HI>in infinitum.</HI> This que&s;tion will em|barra&s;s both of them.</P>
<P>THERE are few or no mathematicians, who defend the hypothe&s;is of indivi&s;ible points; and yet the&s;e have the readie&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t an&s;wer to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. They need only reply, that lines or &s;urfaces are
<PB N="86" REF="97">
equal, when the numbers of points in each are equal; and that as the proportion of the numbers varies, the proportion of the lines and &s;urfaces is al&s;o vary'd. But tho' this an&s;wer be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> as well as obvious; yet I may affirm, that this &s;tandard of equality is entirely <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> and that it ne|ver is from &s;uch a compari&s;on we deter|mine objects to be equal or unequal with re&s;pect to each other. For as the points, which enter into the compo&s;ition of any line or &s;urface, whether perceiv'd by the &s;ight or touch, are &s;o minute and &s;o confounded with each other, that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to compute their number, &s;uch a computation will never afford us a &s;tand|ard, by which we may judge of proportions. No one will ever be able to determine by an exact numeration, that an inch has fewer points than a foot, or a foot fewer than an ell or any greater mea&s;ure; for which rea|&s;on we &s;eldom or never con&s;ider this as the &s;tandard of equality or inequality.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e, who imagine, that exten|&s;ion is divi&s;ible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can make u&s;e of this an&s;wer, or fix the equality of any line or &s;urface by a nume|ration of its component parts. For &s;ince, according to their hypothe&s;is, the lea&s;t as
<PB N="87" REF="98">
well as greate&s;t figures contain an infinite number of parts; and &s;ince infinite num|bers, properly &s;peaking, can neither be equal nor unequal with re&s;pect to each other; the equality or inequality of any portions of &s;pace can never depend on any proportion in the number of their parts. 'Tis true, it may be &s;aid, that the inequality of an ell and a yard con&s;i&s;ts in the different numbers of the feet, of which they are compos'd; and that of a foot and a yard in the number of the inches. But as that quantity we call an inch in the one is &s;uppos'd equal to what we call an inch in the other, and as 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for the mind to find this equality by proceeding <HI>in infinitum</HI> with the&s;e refe|rences to inferior quantities; 'tis evident, that at la&s;t we mu&s;t fix &s;ome &s;tandard of equa|lity different from an enumeration of the parts.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>'s mathematical lectures.</NOTE>, who pretend, that equality is be&s;t defin'd by <HI>congruity,</HI> and that any two figures are equal, when upon the placing of one upon the other, all their parts corre&s;pond to and touch each other. In order to judge of this definition let us con&s;ider, that &s;ince equality is a relation, it is not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, a property in the
<PB N="88" REF="99">
figures them&s;elves, but ari&s;es merely from the compari&s;on, which the mind makes be|twixt them. If it con&s;i&s;ts, therefore, in this imaginary application and mutual contact of parts, we mu&s;t at lea&s;t have a di&s;tinct no|tion of the&s;e parts, and mu&s;t conceive their contact. Now 'tis plain, that in this con|ception we wou'd run up the&s;e parts to the greate&s;t minutene&s;s, which can po&s;&s;ibly be conceiv'd; &s;ince the contact of large parts wou'd never render the figures equal. But the minute&s;t parts we can conceive are ma|thematical points; and con&s;equently this &s;tandard of equality is the &s;ame with that deriv'd from the equality of the number of points; which we have already determin'd to be a ju&s;t but an u&s;ele&s;s &s;tandard. We mu&s;t therefore look to &s;ome other quarter for a &s;olution of the pre&s;ent difficulty.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that the eye, or rather the mind is often able at one view to determine the proportions of bodies, and pronounce them equal to, or greater or le&s;s than each other, without examining or comparing the number of their minute parts. Such judg|ments are not only common, but in many ca&s;es certain and infallible. When the mea|&s;ure of a yard and that of a foot are pre&s;ented, the mind can no more que&s;tion,
<PB N="89" REF="100">
that the fir&s;t is longer than the &s;econd, than it can doubt of tho&s;e principles, which are the mo&s;t clear and &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>THERE are therefore three proportions, which the mind di&s;tingui&s;hes in the general appearance of its objects, and calls by the names of <HI>greater, le&s;s</HI> and <HI>equal.</HI> But tho' its deci&s;ions concerning the&s;e proportions be &s;ometimes infallible, they are not always &s;o; nor are our judgments of this kind more ex|empt from doubt and error, than tho&s;e on any other &s;ubject. We frequently correct our fir&s;t opinion by a review and reflection; and pronounce tho&s;e objects to be equal, which at fir&s;t we e&s;teem'd unequal; and re|gard an object as le&s;s, tho' before it appear'd greater than another. Nor is this the only correction, which the&s;e judgments of our &s;en&s;es undergo; but we often di&s;cover our error by a juxta-po&s;ition of the objects; or where that is impracticable, by the u&s;e of &s;ome common and invariable mea&s;ure, which being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively apply'd to each, informs us of their different proportions. And even this correction is &s;u&s;ceptible of a new cor|rection, and of different degrees of exactne&s;s, according to the nature of the in&s;trument, by which we mea&s;ure the bodies, and the care which we employ in the compari&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">
WHEN therefore the mind is accu&s;tom'd to the&s;e judgments and their corrections, and finds that the &s;ame proportion which makes two figures have in the eye that ap|pearance, which we call <HI>equality,</HI> makes them al&s;o corre&s;pond to each other, and to any common mea&s;ure, with which they are compar'd, we form a mix'd notion of equa|lity deriv'd both from the loo&s;er and &s;tricter methods of compari&s;on. But we are not con|tent with this. For as &s;ound rea&s;on con|vinces us that there are bodies <HI>va&s;tly</HI> more minute than tho&s;e, which appear to the &s;en|&s;es; and as a fal&s;e rea&s;on wou'd per&s;wade us, that there are bodies <HI>infinitely</HI> more mi|nute; we clearly perceive, that we are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of any in&s;trument or art of mea|&s;uring, which can &s;ecure us from all error and uncertainty. We are &s;en&s;ible, that the addition or removal of one of the&s;e minute parts, is not di&s;cernible either in the appear|ance or mea&s;uring; and as we imagine, that two figures, which were equal before, can|not be equal after this removal or addition, we therefore &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome imaginary &s;tand|ard of equality, by which the appearances and mea&s;uring are exactly corrected, and the figures reduc'd entirely to that proportion. This &s;tandard is plainly imaginary. For as
<PB N="91" REF="102">
the very idea of equality is that of &s;uch a particular appearance corrected by juxta-po|&s;ition or a common mea&s;ure, the notion of any correction beyond what we have in&s;tru|ments and art to make, is a mere fiction of the mind, and u&s;ele&s;s as well as incompre|hen&s;ible. But tho' this &s;tandard be only ima|ginary, the fiction however is very natural; nor is any thing more u&s;ual, than for the mind to proceed after this manner with any action, even after the rea&s;on has ceas'd, which fir&s;t determin'd it to begin. This appears very con&s;picuou&s;ly with regard to time; where tho' 'tis evident we have no exact method of determining the propor|tions of parts, not even &s;o exact as in exten|&s;ion, yet the various corrections of our mea|&s;ures, and their different degrees of exactne&s;s, have given us an ob&s;cure and implicit no|tion of a perfect and entire equality. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in many other &s;ubjects. A mu&s;ician finding his ear become every day more delicate, and correcting him&s;elf by re|flection and attention, proceeds with the &s;ame act of the mind, even when the &s;ubject fails him, and entertains a notion of a com|pleat <HI>tierce</HI> or <HI>octave,</HI> without being able to tell whence he derives his &s;tandard. A painter forms the &s;ame fiction with regard
<PB N="92" REF="103">
to colours. A mechanic with regard to motion. To the one <HI>light</HI> and <HI>&s;hade;</HI> to the other <HI>&s;wift</HI> and <HI>&s;low</HI> are imagin'd to be capable of an exact compari&s;on and equality beyond the judgments of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>WE MAY apply the &s;ame rea&s;oning to CURVE and RIGHT lines. Nothing is more apparent to the &s;en&s;es, than the di&s;tinction betwixt a curve and a right line; nor are there any ideas we more ea&s;ily form than the ideas of the&s;e objects. But however ea&s;ily we may form the&s;e ideas, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to produce any definition of them, which will fix the preci&s;e boundaries betwixt them. When we draw lines upon paper or any continu'd &s;urface, there is a certain order, by which the lines run along from one point to ano|ther, that they may produce the entire im|pre&s;&s;ion of a curve or right line; but this order is perfectly unknown, and nothing is ob&s;erv'd but the united appearance. Thus even upon the &s;y&s;tem of indivi&s;ible points, we can only form a di&s;tant notion of &s;ome unknown &s;tandard to the&s;e objects. Upon that of infinite divi&s;ibility we cannot go even this length; but are reduc'd meerly to the general appearance, as the rule by which we determine lines to be either curve or right ones. But tho' we can give no perfect de|finition
<PB N="93" REF="104">
of the&s;e lines, nor produce any very exact method of di&s;tingui&s;hing the one from the other; yet this hinders us not from correcting the fir&s;t appearance by a more ac|curate con&s;ideration, and by a compari&s;on with &s;ome rule, of who&s;e rectitude from re|peated trials we have a greater a&s;&s;urance. And 'tis from the&s;e corrections, and by car|rying on the &s;ame action of the mind, even when its rea&s;on fails us, that we form the loo&s;e idea of a perfect &s;tandard to the&s;e fi|gures, without being able to explain or com|prehend it.</P>
<P>'TIS true, mathematicians pretend they give an exact definition of a right line, when they &s;ay, <HI>it is the &s;horte&s;t way betwixt two points.</HI> But in the fir&s;t place I ob&s;erve, that this is more properly the di&s;covery of one of the properties of a right line, than a ju&s;t definition of it. For I a&s;k any one, if upon mention of a right line he thinks not imme|diately on &s;uch a particular appearance, and if 'tis not by accident only that he con&s;iders this property? A right line can be compre|hended alone; but this definition is unintel|ligible without a compari&s;on with other lines, which we conceive to be more extended. In common life 'tis e&s;tabli&s;h'd as a maxim, that the &s;treighte&s;t way is always the &s;hort|e&s;t;
<PB N="94" REF="105">
which wou'd be as ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, the &s;horte&s;t way is always the &s;horte&s;t, if our idea of a right line was not different from that of the &s;horte&s;t way betwixt two points.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, I repeat what I have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, that we have no preci&s;e idea of equality and inequality, &s;horter and longer, more than of a right line or a curve; and con&s;equently that the one can never afford us a perfect &s;tandard for the other. An ex|act idea can never be built on &s;uch as are loo&s;e and undeterminate.</P>
<P>THE idea of a <HI>plain &s;urface</HI> is as little &s;u&s;|ceptible of a preci&s;e &s;tandard as that of a right line; nor have we any other means of di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;uch a &s;urface, than its ge|neral appearance. 'Tis in vain, that mathe|maticians repre&s;ent a plain &s;urface as pro|duc'd by the flowing of a right line. 'Twill immediately be objected, that our idea of a &s;urface is as independent of this method of forming a &s;urface, as our idea of an ellip&s;e is of that of a cone; that the idea of a right line is no more preci&s;e than that of a plain &s;urface; that a right line may flow irregu|larly, and by that means form a figure quite different from a plane; and that therefore we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to flow along two right
<PB N="95" REF="106">
lines, parallel to each other, and on the &s;ame plane; which is a de&s;cription, that explains a thing by it&s;elf, and returns in a circle.</P>
<P>IT appears, then, that the ideas which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to geometry, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of equality and inequality, of a right line and a plain &s;urface, are far from being exact and determinate, according to our common method of conceiving them. Not only we are incapable of telling, if the ca&s;e be in any degree doubtful, when &s;uch particular figures are equal; when &s;uch a line is a right one, and &s;uch a &s;urface a plain one; but we can form no idea of that proportion, or of the&s;e figures, which is firm and inva|riable. Our appeal is &s;till to the weak and fallible judgment, which we make from the appearance of the objects, and correct by a compa&s;s or common mea&s;ure; and if we join the &s;uppo&s;ition of any farther correction, 'tis of &s;uch-a-one as is either u&s;ele&s;s or ima|ginary. In vain &s;hou'd we have recour&s;e to the common topic, and employ the &s;uppo|&s;ition of a deity, who&s;e omnipotence may enable him to form a perfect geometrical figure, and de&s;cribe a right line without any curve or inflexion. As the ultimate &s;tand|ard of the&s;e figures is deriv'd from nothing but the &s;en&s;es and imagination, 'tis ab&s;urd to
<PB N="96" REF="107">
talk of any perfection beyond what the&s;e faculties can judge of; &s;ince the true per|fection of any thing con&s;i&s;ts in its confor|mity to its &s;tandard.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince the&s;e ideas are &s;o loo&s;e and uncertain, I wou'd fain a&s;k any mathema|tician what infallible a&s;&s;urance he has, not only of the more intricate and ob&s;cure pro|po&s;itions of his &s;cience, but of the mo&s;t vul|gar and obvious principles? How can he prove to me, for in&s;tance, that two right lines cannot have one common &s;egment? Or that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to draw more than one right line betwixt any two points? Shou'd he tell me, that the&s;e opinions are obvi|ou&s;ly ab&s;urd, and repugnant to our clear ideas; I wou'd an&s;wer, that I do not deny, where two right lines incline upon each other with a &s;en&s;ible angle, but 'tis ab&s;urd to imagine them to have a common &s;egment. But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e two lines to approach at the rate of an inch in twenty leagues, I perceive no ab&s;urdity in a&s;&s;erting, that upon their contact they become one. For, I be|&s;eech you, by what rule or &s;tandard do you judge, when you a&s;&s;ert, that the line, in which I have &s;uppos'd them to concur, can|not make the &s;ame right line with tho&s;e two, that form &s;o &s;mall an angle betwixt
<PB N="97" REF="108" MS="y">
them? You mu&s;t &s;urely have &s;ome idea of a right line, to which this line does not agree. Do you therefore mean, that it takes not the points in the &s;ame order and by the &s;ame rule, as is peculiar and e&s;&s;en|tial to a right line? If &s;o, I mu&s;t inform you, that be&s;ides that in judging after this manner you allow, that exten&s;ion is com|pos'd of indivi&s;ible points (which, perhaps, is more than you intend) be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, I mu&s;t inform you, that neither is this the &s;tandard from which we form the idea of a right line; nor, if it were, is there any &s;uch firmne&s;s in our &s;en&s;es or imagination, as to determine when &s;uch an order is vio|lated or pre&s;erv'd. The original &s;tandard of a right line is in reality nothing but a cer|tain general appearance; and 'tis evident right lines may be made to concur with each other, and yet corre&s;pond to this &s;tan|dard, tho' corrected by all the means either practicable or imaginable.</P>
<P>THIS may open our eyes a little, and let us &s;ee, that no geometrical demon&s;tra|tion for the infinite divi&s;ibility of exten&s;ion can have &s;o much force as what we natu|rally attribute to every argument, which is &s;upported by &s;uch magnificent preten&s;ions. At the &s;ame time we may learn the rea&s;on,
<PB N="98" REF="109">
why geometry fails of evidence in this &s;ingle point, while all its other rea&s;onings com|mand our fulle&s;t a&s;&s;ent and approbation. And indeed it &s;eems more requi&s;ite to give the rea&s;on of this exception, than to &s;hew, that we really mu&s;t make &s;uch an exception, and regard all the mathematical arguments for infinite divi&s;ibility as utterly &s;ophi&s;tical. For 'tis evident, that as no idea of quantity is infinitely divi&s;ible, there cannot be ima|gin'd a more glaring ab&s;urdity, than to en|deavour to prove, that quantity it&s;elf admits of &s;uch a divi&s;ion; and to prove this by means of ideas, which are directly oppo&s;ite in that particular. And as this ab&s;urdity is very glaring in it&s;elf, &s;o there is no argument founded on it, which is not attended with a new ab&s;urdity, and involves not an evident contradiction.</P>
<P>I MIGHT give as in&s;tances tho&s;e argu|ments for infinite divi&s;ibility, which are de|riv'd from the <HI>point of contact.</HI> I know there is no mathematician, who will not refu&s;e to be judg'd by the diagrams he de|&s;cribes upon paper, the&s;e being loo&s;e draughts, as he will tell us, and &s;erving only to con|vey with greater facility certain ideas, which are the true foundation of all our rea&s;oning. This I am &s;atisfy'd with, and am willing to
<PB N="99" REF="110">
re&s;t the controver&s;y merely upon the&s;e ideas. I de&s;ire therefore our mathematician to form, as accurately as po&s;&s;ible, the ideas of a circle and a right line; and I then a&s;k, if upon the conception of their contact he can con|ceive them as touching in a mathematical point, or if he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily imagine them to concur for &s;ome &s;pace. Which|ever &s;ide he chu&s;es, he runs him&s;elf into equal difficulties. If he affirms, that in tracing the&s;e figures in his imagination, he can imagine them to touch only in a point, he allows the po&s;&s;ibility of that idea, and con&s;equently of the thing. If he &s;ays, that in his conception of the contact of tho&s;e lines he mu&s;t make them concur, he thereby acknowledges the fallacy of geometrical de|mon&s;trations, when carry'd beyond a certain degree of minutene&s;s; &s;ince 'tis certain he has &s;uch demon&s;trations again&s;t the concur|rence of a circle and a right line; that is, in other words, he can prove an idea, <HI>viz.</HI> that of concurrence, to be <HI>incompatible</HI> with two other ideas, <HI>viz,</HI> tho&s;e of a circle and right line; tho' at the &s;ame time he acknow|ledges the&s;e ideas to be <HI>in&s;eparable.</HI></P>

<P>IF the &s;econd part of my &s;y&s;tem be true, <HI>that the idea of &s;pace or exten&s;ion is no|thing but the idea of vi&s;ible or tangible points di&s;tributed in a certain order;</HI> it follows, that we can form no idea of a vacuum, or &s;pace, where there is nothing vi&s;ible or tangible. This gives ri&s;e to three objections, which I &s;hall examine together, becau&s;e the an|&s;wer I &s;hall give to one is a con&s;equence of that which I &s;hall make u&s;e of for the others.</P>
<P>FIRST, It may be &s;aid, that men have di&s;puted for many ages concerning a va|cuum and a plenum, without being able to bring the affair to a final deci&s;ion; and philo&s;ophers, even at this day, think them|&s;elves at liberty to take party on either &s;ide, as their fancy leads them. But whatever foundation there may be for a controver&s;y concerning the things them&s;elves, it may be pretended, that the very di&s;pute is de|ci&s;ive concerning the idea, and that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible men cou'd &s;o long rea&s;on about a
<PB N="101" REF="112">
vacuum, and either refute or defend it, with|out having a notion of what they refuted or defended.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, If this argument &s;hou'd be conte&s;ted, the reality or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>idea</HI> of a vacuum may be prov'd by the following rea&s;oning. Every idea is po&s;|&s;ible, which is a nece&s;&s;ary and infallible con&s;equence of &s;uch as are po&s;&s;ible. Now tho' we allow the world to be at pre&s;ent a plenum, we may ea&s;ily conceive it to be de|priv'd of motion; and this idea will cer|tainly be allow'd po&s;&s;ible. It mu&s;t al&s;o be allow'd po&s;&s;ible, to conceive the annihilation of any part of matter by the omnipotence of the deity, while the other parts remain at re&s;t. For as every idea, that is di&s;tin|gui&s;hable, is &s;eparable by the imagination; and as every idea, that is &s;eparable by the imagination, may be conceiv'd to be &s;epa|rately exi&s;tent; 'tis evident, that the exi|&s;tence of one particle of matter, no more implies the exi&s;tence of another, than a &s;quare figure in one body implies a &s;quare figure in every one. This being granted, I now demand what re&s;ults from the concur|rence of the&s;e two po&s;&s;ible ideas of <HI>re&s;t</HI> and <HI>annihilation,</HI> and what mu&s;t we conceive to follow upon the annihilation of all the air
<PB N="102" REF="113">
and &s;ubtile matter in the chamber, &s;uppo|&s;ing the walls to remain the &s;ame, without any motion or alteration? There are &s;ome metaphy&s;icians, who an&s;wer, that &s;ince mat|ter and exten&s;ion are the &s;ame, the annihi|lation of one nece&s;&s;arily implies that of the other; and there being now no di&s;tance be|twixt the walls of the chamber, they touch each other; in the &s;ame manner as my hand touches the paper, which is immediately before me. But tho' this an&s;wer be very common, I defy the&s;e metaphy&s;icians to con|ceive the matter according to their hypo|the&s;is, or imagine the floor and roof, with all the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the chamber, to touch each other, while they continue in re&s;t, and pre&s;erve the &s;ame po&s;ition. For how can the two walls, that run from &s;outh to north, touch each other, while they touch the oppo&s;ite ends of two walls, that run from ea&s;t to we&s;t? And how can the floor and roof ever meet, while they are &s;eparated by the four walls, that lie in a contrary po|&s;ition? If you change their po&s;ition, you &s;uppo&s;e a motion. If you conceive any thing betwixt them, you &s;uppo&s;e a new cre|ation. But keeping &s;trictly to the two ideas of <HI>re&s;t</HI> and <HI>annihilation,</HI> 'tis evident, that the idea, which re&s;ults from them, is not that
<PB N="103" REF="114">
of a contact of parts, but &s;omething el&s;e; which is concluded to be the idea of a va|cuum.</P>
<P>THE third objection carries the matter &s;till farther, and not only a&s;&s;erts, that the idea of a vacuum is real and po&s;&s;ible, but al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. This a&s;&s;er|tion is founded on the motion we ob&s;erve in bodies, which, 'tis maintain'd, wou'd be impo&s;&s;ible and inconceivable without a va|cuum, into which one body mu&s;t move in order to make way for another. I &s;hall not enlarge upon this objection, becau&s;e it prin|cipally belongs to natural philo&s;ophy, which lies without our pre&s;ent &s;phere.</P>
<P>IN order to an&s;wer the&s;e objections, we mu&s;t take the matter pretty deep, and con|&s;ider the nature and origin of &s;everal ideas, le&s;t we di&s;pute without under&s;tanding per|fectly the &s;ubject of the controver&s;y. 'Tis evident the idea of darkne&s;s is no po&s;itive idea, but merely the negation of light, or more properly &s;peaking, of colour'd and vi|&s;ible objects. A man, who enjoys his &s;ight, receives no other perception from turning his eyes on every &s;ide, when entirely depriv'd of light, than what is common to him with one born blind; and 'tis certain &s;uch-a-one has no idea either of light or darkne&s;s. The

con&s;equence of this is, that 'tis not from the mere removal of vi&s;ible objects we re|ceive the impre&s;&s;ion of exten&s;ion without matter; and that the idea of utter darkne&s;s can never be the &s;ame with that of va|cuum.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again a man to be &s;upported in the air, and to be &s;oftly convey'd along by &s;ome invi&s;ible power; 'tis evident he is &s;en&s;ible of nothing, and never receives the idea of exten&s;ion, nor indeed any idea, from this invariable motion. Even &s;uppo&s;ing he moves his limbs to and fro, this cannot con|vey to him that idea. He feels in that ca&s;e a certain &s;en&s;ation or impre&s;&s;ion, the parts of which are &s;ucce&s;&s;ive to each other, and may give him the idea of time: But cer|tainly are not di&s;pos'd in &s;uch a manner, as is nece&s;&s;ary to convey the idea of &s;pace or exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>SINCE then it appears, that darkne&s;s and motion, with the utter removal of every thing vi&s;ible and tangible, can never give us the idea of exten&s;ion without matter, or of a vacuum; the next que&s;tion is, whether they can convey this idea, when mix'd with &s;omething vi&s;ible and tangible?</P>
<P>'TIS commonly allow'd by philo&s;ophers, that all bodies, which di&s;cover them&s;elves to
<PB N="105" REF="116">
the eye, appear as if painted on a plain &s;ur|face, and that their different degrees of re|motene&s;s from our&s;elves are di&s;cover'd more by rea&s;on than by the &s;en&s;es. When I hold up my hand before me, and &s;pread my fin|gers, they are &s;eparated as perfectly by the blue colour of the firmament, as they cou'd be by any vi&s;ible object, which I cou'd place betwixt them. In order, therefore, to know whether the &s;ight can convey the impre&s;&s;ion and idea of a vacuum, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that amid&s;t an entire darkne&s;s, there are luminous bodies pre&s;ented to us, who&s;e light di&s;covers only the&s;e bodies them&s;elves, without giving us any impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;urrounding objects.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t form a parallel &s;uppo&s;ition con|cerning the objects of our feeling. 'Tis not proper to &s;uppo&s;e a perfect removal of all tangible objects: we mu&s;t allow &s;omething to be perceiv'd by the feeling; and after an interval and motion of the hand or other organ of &s;en&s;ation, another object of the touch to be met with; and upon leaving that, another; and &s;o on, as often as we plea&s;e. The que&s;tion is, whether the&s;e in|tervals do not afford us the idea of exten&s;ion without body?</P>
<P>TO begin with the fir&s;t ca&s;e; 'tis evident, that when only two luminous bodies ap|pear
<PB N="106" REF="117">
to the eye, we can perceive, whether they be conjoin'd or &s;eparate; whether they be &s;eparated by a great or &s;mall di&s;tance; and if this di&s;tance varies, we can perceive its increa&s;e or diminution, with the motion of the bodies. But as the di&s;tance is not in this ca&s;e any thing colour'd or vi&s;ible, it may be thought that there is here a vacuum or pure exten&s;ion, not only intelligible to the mind, but obvious to the very &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS is our natural and mo&s;t familiar way of thinking; but which we &s;hall learn to correct by a little reflection. We may ob&s;erve, that when two bodies pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, where there was formerly an entire darkne&s;s, the only change, that is di&s;cover|able, is in the appearance of the&s;e two ob|jects, and that all the re&s;t continues to be as before, a perfect negation of light, and of every colour'd or vi&s;ible object. This is not only true of what may be &s;aid to be remote from the&s;e bodies, but al&s;o of the very di&s;tance; which is interpos'd betwixt them; <HI>that</HI> being nothing but darkne&s;s, or the negation of light; without parts, with|out compo&s;ition, invariable and indivi&s;ible. Now &s;ince this di&s;tance cau&s;es no percep|tion different from what a blind man receives from his eyes, or what is convey'd to us in
<PB N="107" REF="118">
the darke&s;t night, it mu&s;t partake of the &s;ame properties: And as blindne&s;s and dark|ne&s;s afford us no ideas of exten&s;ion, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that the dark and undi&s;tingui&s;hable di&s;tance betwixt two bodies can ever pro|duce that idea.</P>
<P>THE &s;ole difference betwixt an ab&s;olute darkne&s;s and the appearance of two or more vi&s;ible luminous objects con&s;i&s;ts, as I &s;aid, in the objects them&s;elves, and in the manner they affect our &s;en&s;es. The angles, which the rays of light flowing from them, form with each other; the motion that is requir'd in the eye, in its pa&s;&s;age from one to the other; and the different parts of the organs, which are affected by them; the&s;e produce the only perceptions, from which we can judge of the di&s;tance. But as the&s;e perceptions are each of them &s;imple and indivi&s;ible, they can never give us the idea of exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE may illu&s;trate this by con&s;idering the &s;en&s;e of feeling, and the imaginary di&s;tance or interval interpos'd betwixt tangible or &s;olid objects. I &s;uppo&s;e two ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a man &s;upported in the air, and moving his limbs to and fro, without meeting any thing tangible; and that of a man, who feeling &s;omething tangible, leaves it, and after a motion, of which he is &s;en&s;ible, perceives
<PB N="108" REF="119">
another tangible object; and I then a&s;k, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the difference betwixt the&s;e two ca&s;es? No one will make any &s;cruple to affirm, that it con&s;i&s;ts meerly in the per|ceiving tho&s;e objects, and that the &s;en&s;ation, which ari&s;es from the motion, is in both ca&s;es the &s;ame: And as that &s;en&s;ation is not capable of conveying to us an idea of exten&s;ion, when unaccompany'd with &s;ome other perception, it can no more give us that idea, when mix'd with the impre&s;&s;ions of tangible objects; &s;ince that mixture pro|duces no alteration upon it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' motion and darkne&s;s, either a|lone, or attended with tangible and vi&s;ible objects, convey no idea of a vacuum or ex|ten&s;ion without matter, yet they are the cau&s;es why we fal&s;ly imagine we can form &s;uch an idea. For there is a clo&s;e relation betwixt that motion and darkne&s;s, and a real exten&s;ion, or compo&s;ition of vi&s;ible and tangible objects.</P>
<P>FIRST, We may ob&s;erve, that two vi|&s;ible objects appearing in the mid&s;t of utter darkne&s;s, affect the &s;en&s;es in the &s;ame man|ner, and form the &s;ame angle by the rays, which flow from them, and meet in the eye, as if the di&s;tance betwixt them were fill'd with vi&s;ible objects, that give us a true
<PB N="109" REF="120">
idea of exten&s;ion. The &s;en&s;ation of motion is likewi&s;e the &s;ame, when there is nothing tangible interpos'd betwixt two bodies, as when we feel a compounded body, who&s;e different parts are plac'd beyond each other.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, We find by experience, that two bodies, which are &s;o plac'd as to affect the &s;en&s;es in the &s;ame manner with two others, that have a certain extent of vi&s;ible objects interpos'd betwixt them, are capable of receiving the &s;ame extent, with|out any &s;en&s;ible impul&s;e or penetration, and without any change on that angle, under which they appear to the &s;en&s;es. In like manner, where there is one object, which we cannot feel after another without an in|terval, and the perceiving of that &s;en&s;ation we call motion in our hand or organ of &s;en|&s;ation; experience &s;hews us, that 'tis po&s;&s;i|ble the &s;ame object may be felt with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation of motion, along with the interpos'd impre&s;&s;ion of &s;olid and tangible objects, attending the &s;en&s;ation. That is, in other words, an invi&s;ible and intangible di&s;tance may be converted into a vi&s;ible and tangible one, without any change on the di&s;tant objects.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We may ob&s;erve, as another relation betwixt the&s;e two kinds of di&s;tance,
<PB N="110" REF="121">
that they have nearly the &s;ame effects on every natural phaenomenon. For as all qualities, &s;uch as heat, cold, light, attrac|tion, &amp;c. dimini&s;h in proportion to the di|&s;tance; there is but little difference ob&s;erv'd, whether this di&s;tance be mark'd out by com|pounded and &s;en&s;ible objects, or be known only by the manner, in which the di&s;tant objects affect the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>HERE then are three relations betwixt that di&s;tance, which conveys the idea of ex|ten&s;ion, and that other, which is not fill'd with any colour'd or &s;olid object. The di|&s;tant objects affect the &s;en&s;es in the &s;ame manner, whether &s;eparated by the one di&s;tance or the other; the &s;econd &s;pecies of di&s;tance is found capable of receiving the fir&s;t; and they both equally dimini&s;h the force of every quality.</P>
<P>THESE relations betwixt the two kinds of di&s;tance will afford us an ea&s;y rea&s;on, why the one has &s;o often been taken for the other, and why we imagine we have an idea of exten&s;ion without the idea of any object either of the &s;ight or feeling. For we may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a general maxim in this &s;cience of human nature, that wherever there is a clo&s;e relation betwixt two ideas, the mind is very apt to mi&s;take them, and
<PB N="111" REF="122" MS="y">
in all its di&s;cour&s;es and rea&s;onings to u&s;e the one for the other. This phaenomenon oc|curs on &s;o many occa&s;ions, and is of &s;uch con&s;equence, that I cannot forbear &s;topping a moment to examine its cau&s;es. I &s;hall only premi&s;e, that we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h ex|actly betwixt the phaenomenon it&s;elf, and the cau&s;es, which I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign for it; and mu&s;t not imagine from any uncertainty in the latter, that the former is al&s;o uncertain. The phaenomenon may be real, tho' my explication be chimerical. The fal&s;hood of the one is no con&s;equence of that of the other; tho' at the &s;ame time we may ob|&s;erve, that 'tis very natural for us to draw &s;uch a con&s;equence; which is an evident in&s;tance of that very principle, which I en|deavour to explain.</P>
<P>WHEN I receiv'd the relations of <HI>re&s;emb|lance, contiguity</HI> and <HI>cau&s;ation,</HI> as principles of union among ideas, without examining into their cau&s;es, 'twas more in pro&s;ecution of my fir&s;t maxim, that we mu&s;t in the end re&s;t contented with experience, than for want of &s;omething &s;pecious and plau&s;ible, which I might have di&s;play'd on that &s;ub|ject. 'Twou'd have been ea&s;y to have made an imaginary defection of the brain, and have &s;hewn, why upon our conception of any
<PB N="112" REF="123">
idea, the animal &s;pirits run into all the con|tiguous traces, and rouze up the other ideas, that are related to it. But tho' I have ne|glected any advantage, which I might have drawn from this topic in explaining the re|lations of ideas, I am afraid I mu&s;t here have recour&s;e to it, in order to account for the mi&s;takes that ari&s;e from the&s;e relations. I &s;hall therefore ob&s;erve, that as the mind is endow'd with a power of exciting any idea it plea&s;es; whenever it di&s;patches the &s;pirits into that region of the brain, in which the idea is plac'd; the&s;e &s;pirits always excite the idea, when they run preci&s;ely into the proper traces, and rummage that cell, which belongs to the idea. But as their motion is &s;eldom direct, and naturally turns a little to the one &s;ide or the other; for this rea&s;on the animal &s;pirits, falling into the contigu|ous traces, pre&s;ent other related ideas in lieu of that, which the mind de&s;ir'd at fir&s;t to &s;urvey. This change we are not always &s;en|&s;ible of; but continuing &s;till the &s;ame train of thought, make u&s;e of the related idea, which is pre&s;ented to us, and employ it in our rea|&s;oning, as if it were the &s;ame with what we demanded. This is the cau&s;e of many mi&s;takes and &s;ophi&s;ms in philo&s;phy; as
<PB N="113" REF="124">
will naturally be imagin'd, and as it wou'd be ea&s;y to &s;how, if there was occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>OF the three relations above-mention'd that of re&s;emblance is the mo&s;t fertile &s;ource of error; and indeed there are few mi&s;takes in rea&s;oning, which do not borrow largely from that origin. Re&s;embling ideas are not only related together, but the actions of the mind, which we employ in con&s;idering them, are &s;o little different, that we are not able to di&s;tingui&s;h them. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is of great con&s;equence; and we may in ge|neral ob&s;erve, that wherever the actions of the mind in forming any two ideas are the &s;ame or re&s;embling, we are very apt to confound the&s;e ideas, and take the one for the other. Of this we &s;hall &s;ee many in|&s;tances in the progre&s;s of this treati&s;e. But tho' re&s;emblance be the relation, which mo&s;t readily produces a mi&s;take in ideas, yet the others of cau&s;ation and contiguity may al&s;o concur in the &s;ame influence. We might produce the figures of poets and orators, as &s;ufficient proofs of this, were it as u&s;ual, as it is rea&s;onable, in metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects to draw our arguments from that quarter. But le&s;t metaphy&s;icians &s;hou'd e&s;teem this below their dignity, I &s;hall borrow a proof from an ob&s;ervation, which may be made on mo&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="125">
of their own di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> that 'tis u&s;ual for men to u&s;e words for ideas, and to talk in&s;tead of thinking in their rea&s;onings. We u&s;e words for ideas, becau&s;e they are com|monly &s;o clo&s;ely connected, that the mind ea&s;ily mi&s;takes them. And this likewi&s;e is the rea&s;on, why we &s;ab&s;titute the idea of a di&s;tance, which is not con&s;ider'd either as vi&s;ible or tangible, in the room of exten&s;ion, which is nothing but a compo&s;ition of vi|&s;ible or tangible points di&s;pos'd in a certain order. In cau&s;ing this mi&s;take there concur both the relations of <HI>cau&s;ation</HI> and <HI>re&s;em|blance.</HI> As, the fir&s;t &s;pecies of di&s;tance is found to be convertible into the &s;econd, 'tis in this re&s;pect a kind of cau&s;e; and the &s;imilarity of their manner of affecting the &s;en&s;es, and dimini&s;hing every quality, forms the relation of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>AFTER this chain of rea&s;oning and ex|plication of my principles, I am now pre|par'd to an&s;wer all the objections that have been offer'd, whether deriv'd from <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> or <HI>mechanics.</HI> The frequent di&s;putes con|cerning a vacuum, or exten&s;ion without matter, prove not the reality of the idea, upon which the di&s;pute turns; there being nothing more common, than to &s;ee men de|ceive them&s;elves in this particular; e&s;pecially
<PB N="115" REF="126">
when by means of any clo&s;e relation, there is another idea pre&s;ented, which may be the occa&s;ion of their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>WE may make almo&s;t the &s;ame an&s;wer to the &s;econd objection, deriv'd from the con|junction of the ideas of re&s;t and annihilation. When every thing is annihilated in the chamber, and the walls continue imove|able, the chamber mu&s;t be conceiv'd much in the &s;ame manner as at pre&s;ent, when the air that fills it, is not an object of the &s;en&s;es. This annihilation leaves to the <HI>eye,</HI> that fictitious di&s;tance, which is di&s;cover'd by the different parts of the organ, that are affected, and by the degrees of light and &s;hade; and to the <HI>feeling,</HI> that which con|&s;i&s;ts in a &s;en&s;ation of motion in the hand, or other member of the body. In vain &s;hou'd we &s;earch any farther. On which|ever &s;ide we turn this &s;ubject, we &s;hall find that the&s;e are the only impre&s;&s;ions &s;uch an object can produce after the &s;uppos'd annihi|lation; and it has already been remark'd, that impre&s;&s;ions can give ri&s;e to no ideas, but to &s;uch as re&s;emble them.</P>
<P>SINCE a body interpos'd betwixt two others may be &s;uppos'd to be annihi|lated, without producing any change upon &s;uch as lie on each hand of it, 'tis ea&s;ily
<PB N="116" REF="127">
conceiv'd, how it may be created anew, and yet produce as little alteration. Now the motion of a body has much the &s;ame effect as its creation. The di&s;tant bodies are no more affected in the one ca&s;e, than in the other. This &s;uffices to &s;atisfy the ima|gination, and proves there is no repugnance in &s;uch a motion. Afterwards experience comes in play to per&s;uade us that two bo|dies, &s;ituated in the manner above-de&s;crib'd, have really &s;uch a capacity of receiving body betwixt them, and that there is no ob&s;tacle to the conver&s;ion of the invi&s;ible and intan|gible di&s;tance into one that is vi&s;ible and tangible. However natural that conver&s;ion may &s;eem, we cannot be &s;ure it is practi|cable, before we have had experience of it.</P>
<P>THUS I &s;eem to have an&s;wer'd the three objections above-mention'd; tho' at the &s;ame time I am &s;en&s;ible, that few will be &s;atisfy'd with the&s;e an&s;wers, but will immediately propo&s;e new objections and difficulties. 'Twill probably be &s;aid, that my rea&s;oning makes nothing to the matter in hand, and that I explain only the manner in which objects affect the &s;en&s;es, without endeavouring to account for their real nature and operations. Tho' there be nothing vi&s;ible or tangible interpos'd betwixt two bodies, yet we find
<PB N="117" REF="128">
<HI>by experience,</HI> that the bodies may be plac'd in the &s;ame manner, with regard to the eye, and require the &s;ame motion of the hand in pa&s;&s;ing from one to the other, as if di|vided by &s;omething vi&s;ible and tangible. This invi&s;ible and intangible di&s;tance is al&s;o found <HI>by experience</HI> to contain a capacity of receiv|ing body, or of becoming vi&s;ible and tan|gible. Here is the whole of my &s;y&s;tem; and in no part of it have I endeavour'd to explain the cau&s;e, which &s;eparates bodies after this manner, and gives them a capacity of receiving others betwixt them, without any impul&s;e or penetration.</P>
<P>I ANSWER this objection, by pleading guilty, and by confe&s;&s;ing that my intention never was to penetrate into the nature of bo|dies, or explain the &s;ecret cau&s;es of their operations. For be&s;ides that this belongs not to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I am afraid, that &s;uch an enterprize is beyond the reach of human under&s;tanding, and that we can never pretend to know body otherwi&s;e than by tho&s;e external properties, which di&s;cover them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es. As to tho&s;e who attempt any thing farther, I cannot approve of their ambition, till I &s;ee, in &s;ome one in|&s;tance at lea&s;t, that they have met with &s;ucce&s;s. But at pre&s;ent I content my&s;elf
<PB N="118" REF="129">
with knowing perfectly the manner in which objects affect my &s;en&s;es, and their connections with each other, as far as experience informs me of them. This &s;uffices for the conduct of life; and this al&s;o &s;uffices for my phi|lo&s;ophy, which pretends only to explain the nature and cau&s;es of our perceptions, or im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject of exten|&s;ion with a paradox, which will ea&s;ily be explain'd from the foregoing rea&s;oning. This paradox is, that if you are pleas'd to give to the invi&s;ible and intangible di&s;tance, or in other words, to the capacity of becoming a vi&s;ible and tangible di&s;tance, the name of a vacuum, exten&s;ion and matter are the &s;ame, and yet there is a vacuum. If you will not give it that name, motion is po&s;&s;ible in a plenum, without any impul&s;e <HI>in infinitum,</HI> without returning in a circle, and without penetration. But however we may expre&s;s our&s;elves, we mu&s;t always confe&s;s, that we have no idea of any real exten&s;ion without filling it with &s;en&s;ible objects, and conceiving its parts as vi&s;ible or tangible.</P>
<P>AS to the doctrine, that time is nothing but the manner, in which &s;ome real objects exi&s;t; we may ob&s;erve, that 'tis liable to the &s;ame objections as the &s;imilar doctrine
<PB N="119" REF="130">
with regard to exten&s;ion. If it be a &s;uffi|cient proof, that we have the idea of a va|cuum, becau&s;e we di&s;pute and rea&s;on con|cerning it; we mu&s;t for the &s;ame rea&s;on have the idea of time without any change|able exi&s;tence; &s;ince there is no &s;ubject of di&s;pute more frequent and common. But that we really have no &s;uch idea, is certain. For whence &s;hou'd it be deriv'd? Does it ari&s;e from an impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ation or of reflection? Point it out di&s;tinctly to us, that we may know its nature and qualities. But if you cannot point out <HI>any &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion,</HI> you may be certain you are mi&s;taken, when you imagine you have <HI>any &s;uch idea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' it be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew the impre&s;&s;ion, from which the idea of time without a changeable exi&s;tence is deriv'd; yet we can ea&s;ily point out tho&s;e appear|ances, which make us fancy we have that idea. For we may ob&s;erve, that there is a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions in our mind; &s;o that the idea of time being for ever pre&s;ent with us; when we con&s;ider a &s;tedfa&s;t object at five-a-clock, and regard the &s;ame at &s;ix; we are apt to apply to it that idea in the &s;ame manner as if every moment were di&s;tingui&s;h'd by a dif|ferent po&s;ition, or an alteration of the object.
<PB N="120" REF="131">
The fir&s;t and &s;econd appearances of the ob|ject, being compar'd with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our perceptions, &s;eem equally remov'd as if the object had really chang'd. To which we may add, what experience &s;hews us, that the object was &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch a number of changes betwixt the&s;e appearances; as al&s;o that the unchangeable or rather fictitious du|ration has the &s;ame effect upon every quality, by encrea&s;ing or dimini&s;hing it, as that &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, which is obvious to the &s;en&s;es. From the&s;e three relations we are apt to confound our ideas, and imagine we can form the idea of a time and duration, without any change or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

all tho&s;e particular ideas, which may enter into our rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>THERE is no impre&s;&s;ion nor idea of any kind, of which we have any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or memory, that is not conceiv'd as exi&s;tent; and 'tis evident, that from this con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s the mo&s;t perfect idea and a&s;&s;urance of <HI>being</HI> is deriv'd.

<P>As this dilemma is an evident con&s;equence of the principle, that every idea ari&s;es from a &s;imilar impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o our deci&s;ion betwixt the propo&s;itions of the dilemma is no more doubtful. So far from there being any di|&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion, attending every impre&s;&s;ion and every idea, that I do not think there are any two di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ions, which are in&s;eparably conjoin'd. Tho' certain &s;en&s;a|tions may at one time be united, we quickly find they admit of a &s;eparation, and may be pre&s;ented apart. And thus, tho' every im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="122" REF="133">
and idea we remember be con&s;i|der'd as exi&s;tent, the idea of exi&s;tence is not deriv'd from any particular impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE idea of exi&s;tence, then, is the very &s;ame with the idea of what we conceive to be exi&s;tent. To reflect on any thing &s;imply, and to reflect on it as exi&s;tent, are nothing different from each other. That idea, when conjoin'd with the idea of any object, makes no addition to it. Whatever we conceive, we conceive to be exi&s;tent. Any idea we plea&s;e to form is the idea of a being; and the idea of a being is any idea we plea&s;e to form.</P>
<P>WHOEVER oppo&s;es this, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly point out that di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion, from which the idea of entity is deriv'd, and mu&s;t prove, that this impre&s;&s;ion is in&s;eparable from every perception we believe to be exi&s;tent. This we may without he&s;itation conclude to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>OUR foregoing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part I. Sect. 7.</NOTE> rea&s;oning concerning the <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> of ideas without any real <HI>diffe|rence</HI> will not here &s;erve us in any &s;tead. That kind of di&s;tinction is founded on the different re&s;emblances, which the &s;ame &s;imple idea may have to &s;everal different ideas. But no object can be pre&s;ented re&s;embling &s;ome
<PB N="123" REF="134">
object with re&s;pect to its exi&s;tence, and dif|ferent from others in the &s;ame particular; &s;ince every object, that is pre&s;ented, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be exi&s;tent.</P>
<P>A LIKE rea&s;oning will account for the idea of <HI>external exi&s;tence.</HI> We may ob&s;erve, that 'tis univer&s;ally allow'd by philo&s;ophers, and is be&s;ides pretty obvious of it&s;elf, that nothing is ever really pre&s;ent with the mind but its perceptions or impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, and that external objects become known to us only by tho&s;e perceptions they occa&s;ion. To hate, to love, to think, to feel, to &s;ee; all this is nothing but to perceive.</P>
<P>NOW &s;ince nothing is ever pre&s;ent to the mind but perceptions, and &s;ince all ideas are deriv'd from &s;omething antecedently pre&s;ent to the mind; it follows, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us &s;o much as to conceive or form an idea of any thing &s;pecifically different from ideas and impre&s;&s;ions. Let us fix our at|tention out of our&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible: Let us chace our imagination to the hea|vens, or to the utmo&s;t limits of the univer&s;e; we never really advance a &s;tep beyond our|&s;elves, nor can conceive any kind of exi|&s;tence, but tho&s;e perceptions, which have appear'd in that narrow compa&s;s. This is
<PB N="124" REF="135">
the univer&s;e of the imagination, nor have we any idea but what is there produc'd.</P>
<P>THE farthe&s;t we can go towards a con|ception of external objects, when &s;uppos'd <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> different from our perceptions, is to form a relative idea of them, without pretending to comprehend the related ob|jects. Generally &s;peaking we do not &s;uppo&s;e them &s;pecifically different; but only attri|bute to them different relations, connections and durations.

<P>_THERE are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part I. Sect. 5.</NOTE> &s;even different kinds of philo&s;ophical relation, <HI>viz. re|&s;emblance, identity, relations of time and place, proportion in quantity or number, degrees in any quality, contrariety, and cau&s;ation.</HI> The&s;e relations may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es; into &s;uch as depend entirely on the ideas, which we compare together, and &s;uch as may be chang'd without any change in the ideas. 'Tis from the idea of a triangle, that we di&s;cover the relation of equality, which its three angles bear to two right ones; and this relation is invariable, as long as our idea remains the &s;ame. On the contrary,
<PB N="126" REF="137">
the relations of <HI>contiguity</HI> and <HI>di&s;tance</HI> be|twixt two objects may be chang'd merely by an alteration of their place, without any change on the objects them&s;elves or on their ideas; and the place it depends on a hun|dred different accidents, which cannot be fore&s;een by the mind. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with <HI>identity</HI> and <HI>cau&s;ation.</HI> Two objects, tho' perfectly re&s;embling each other, and even appearing in the &s;ame place at diffe|rent times, may be numerically different: And as the power, by which one object pro|duces another, is never di&s;coverable merely from their idea, 'tis evident <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect</HI> are relations, of which we receive infor|mation from experience, and not from any ab&s;tract rea&s;oning or reflection. There is no &s;ingle phaenomenon, even the mo&s;t &s;imple, which can be accounted for from the qua|lities of the objects, as they appear to us; or which we cou'd fore&s;ee without the help of our memory and experience.</P>
<P>IT appears, therefore, that of the&s;e &s;even philo&s;ophical relations, there remain only four, which depending &s;olely upon ideas, can be the objects of knowledge and cer|tainty. The&s;e four are <HI>re&s;emblance, contra|riety, degrees in quality, and proportions in quantity or number.</HI> Three of the&s;e rela|tions
<PB N="127" REF="138">
are di&s;coverable at fir&s;t &s;ight, and fall more properly under the province of intui|tion than demon&s;tration. When any ob|jects <HI>re&s;emble</HI> each other, the re&s;emblance will at fir&s;t &s;trike the eye, or rather the mind; and &s;eldom requires a &s;econd exa|mination. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with <HI>con|trariety,</HI> and with the <HI>degrees</HI> of any <HI>quality.</HI> No one can once doubt but exi&s;tence and non-exi&s;tence de&s;troy each other, and are perfectly incompatible and contrary. And tho' it be impo&s;&s;ible to judge exactly of the degrees of any quality, &s;uch as colour, ta&s;te, heat, cold, when the difference betwixt them is very &s;mall; yet 'tis ea&s;y to decide, that any of them is &s;uperior or inferior to another, when their difference is con&s;ider|able. And this deci&s;ion we always pro|nounce at fir&s;t &s;ight, without any enquiry or rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>WE might proceed, after the &s;ame man|ner, in fixing the <HI>proportions</HI> of <HI>quantity</HI> or <HI>number,</HI> and might at one view ob&s;erve a &s;uperiority or inferiority betwixt any num|bers, or figures; e&s;pecially where the dif|ference is very great and remarkable. As to equality or any exact proportion, we can only gue&s;s at it from a &s;ingle con&s;ideration; except in very &s;hort numbers, or very limited
<PB N="128" REF="139">
portions of exten&s;ion; which are comprehend|ed in an in&s;tant, and where we perceive an impo&s;&s;ibility of falling into any con&s;iderable error. In all other ca&s;es we mu&s;t &s;ettle the proportions with &s;ome liberty, or proceed in a more <HI>artificial</HI> manner.</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erv'd, that geometry, or the <HI>art,</HI> by which we fix the proportions of figures; tho' it much excels both in uni|ver&s;ality and exactne&s;s, the loo&s;e judgments of the &s;en&s;es and imagination; yet never at|tains a perfect preci&s;ion and exactne&s;s. It's fir&s;t principles are &s;till drawn from the general appearance of the objects; and that appear|ance can never afford us any &s;ecurity, when we examine the prodigious minutene&s;s of which nature is &s;u&s;ceptible. Our ideas &s;eem to give a perfect a&s;&s;urance, that no two right lines can have a common &s;egment; but if we con&s;ider the&s;e ideas, we &s;hall find, that they always &s;uppo&s;e a &s;en&s;ible inclination of the two lines, and that where the angle they form is extremely &s;mall, we have no &s;tand|ard of a right line &s;o preci&s;e as to a&s;&s;ure us of the truth of this propo&s;ition. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e with mo&s;t of the primary deci&s;ions of the mathematics.</P>
<P>THERE remain, therefore, algebra and arithmetic as the only &s;ciences, in which we
<PB N="129" REF="140">
can carry on a chain of rea&s;oning to any de|gree of intricacy, and yet pre&s;erve a perfect exactne&s;s and certainty. We are po&s;&s;e&s;t of a preci&s;e &s;tandard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they corre&s;pond or not to that &s;tandard, we determine their relations, without any po&s;&s;ibility of error. When two numbers are &s;o combin'd, as that the one has always an unite an&s;wering to every unite of the other, we pronounce them equal; and 'tis for want of &s;uch a &s;tandard of equa|lity in exten&s;ion, that geometry can &s;carce be e&s;teem'd a perfect and infallible &s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>BUT here it may not be ami&s;s to obviate a difficulty, which may ari&s;e from my a&s;&s;ert|ing, that tho' geometry falls &s;hort of that perfect preci&s;ion and certainty, which are peculiar to arithmetic and algebra, yet it excels the imperfect judgments of our &s;en&s;es and imagination. The rea&s;on why I impute any defect to geometry, is, becau&s;e its ori|ginal and fundamantal principles are deriv'd merely from appearances; and it may per|haps be imagin'd, that this defect mu&s;t always attend it, and keep it from ever reaching a greater exactne&s;s in the compari&s;on of ob|jects or ideas, than what our eye or imagi|nation
<PB N="130" REF="141">
alone is able to attain. I own that this defect &s;o far attends it, as to keep it from ever a&s;piring to a full certainty: But &s;ince the&s;e fundamental principles depend on the ea&s;ie&s;t and lea&s;t deceitful appearances, they be&s;tow on their con&s;equences a degree of exactne&s;s, of which the&s;e con&s;equences are &s;ingly incapable. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for the eye to determine the angles of a chiliagon to be equal to 1996 right angles, or make any conjecture, that approaches this proportion; but when it determines, that right lines cannot concur; that we cannot draw more than one right line between two given points; it's mi&s;takes can never be of any con&s;e|quence. And this is the nature and u&s;e of geometry, to run us up to &s;uch appearances, as, by rea&s;on of their &s;implicity, cannot lead us into any con&s;iderable error.</P>
<P>I SHALL here take occa&s;ion to propo&s;e a &s;econd ob&s;ervation concerning our demon&s;tra|tive rea&s;onings, which is &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ame &s;ubject of the mathematics. 'Tis u&s;ual with mathematicians, to pretend, that tho&s;e ideas, which are their objects, are of &s;o refin'd and &s;piritual a nature, that they fall not under the conception of the fancy, but mu&s;t be comprehended by a pure and intellectual view, of which the &s;uperior faculties of the &s;oul
<PB N="131" REF="142">
are alone capable. The &s;ame notion runs thro' mo&s;t parts of philo&s;ophy, and is prin|cipally made u&s;e of to explain our ab&s;tract ideas, and to &s;hew how we can form an idea of a triangle, for in&s;tance, which &s;hall neither be an i&s;oceles nor &s;calenum, nor be confin'd to any particular length and pro|portion of &s;ides. 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, why phi|lo&s;ophers are &s;o fond of this notion of &s;ome &s;piritual and refin'd perceptions; &s;ince by that means they cover many of their ab&s;urdities, and may refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ions of clear ideas, by appealing to &s;uch as are ob|&s;cure and uncertain. But to de&s;troy this artifice, we need but reflect on that princi|ple &s;o oft in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>that all our ideas are copy'd from our impre&s;&s;ions.</HI> For from thence we may immediately conclude, that &s;ince all impre&s;&s;ions are clear and preci&s;e, the ideas, which are copy'd from them, mu&s;t be of the &s;ame nature, and can never, but from our fault, contain any thing &s;o dark and intricate. An idea is by its very na|ture weaker and fainter than an impre&s;&s;ion; but being in every other re&s;pect the &s;ame, cannot imply any very great my&s;tery. If its weakne&s;s render it ob&s;cure, 'tis our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to remedy that defect, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by keeping the idea &s;teady and

<P>THIS is all I think nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve concerning tho&s;e four relations, which are the foundation of &s;cience; but as to the other three, which depend not upon the idea, and may be ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent even while <HI>that</HI> remains the &s;ame, 'twill be pro|per to explain them more particularly. The&s;e three relations are <HI>identity, the &s;itu|ations in time and place, and cau&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>ALL kinds of rea&s;oning con&s;i&s;t in nothing but a <HI>compari&s;on,</HI> and a di&s;covery of tho&s;e re|lations, either con&s;tant or incon&s;tant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This compari&s;on we may make, either when both the objects are pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es, or when neither of them is pre&s;ent, or when only one. When both the objects are pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es along with the relation, we call <HI>this</HI> perception rather than rea&s;oning; nor is there in this ca&s;e any exerci&s;e of the
<PB N="133" REF="144">
thought, or any action, properly &s;peaking, but a mere pa&s;&s;ive admi&s;&s;ion of the impre&s;|&s;ions thro' the organs of &s;en&s;ation. Accord|ing to this way of thinking, we ought not to receive as rea&s;oning any of the ob&s;ervations we may make concerning <HI>identity,</HI> and the <HI>relations</HI> of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place;</HI> &s;ince in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es, either to di&s;cover the real exi&s;tence or the relations of objects. 'Tis only <HI>cau&s;ation,</HI> which produces &s;uch a connexion, as to give us a&s;&s;urance from the exi&s;tence or action of one object, that 'twas follow'd or preceded by any other exi&s;tence or action; nor can the other two relations be ever made u&s;e of in rea&s;oning, except &s;o far as they either affect or are affected by it. There is nothing in any ob|jects to per&s;wade us, that they are either al|ways <HI>remote</HI> or always <HI>contiguous;</HI> and when from experience and ob&s;ervation we di&s;co|ver, that their relation in this particular is invariable, we always conclude there is &s;ome &s;ecret <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> which &s;eparates or unites them. The &s;ame rea&s;oning extends to <HI>identity.</HI> We readily &s;uppo&s;e an object may continue in|dividually the &s;ame, tho' &s;everal times ab|&s;ent from and pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es; and a&s;cribe to it an identity, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="134" REF="145">
the interruption of the perception, whenever we conclude, that if we had kept our eye or hand con&s;tantly upon it, it wou'd have convey'd an invariable and uninterrupted per|ception. But this conclu&s;ion beyond the impre&s;&s;ions of our &s;en&s;es can be founded only on the connexion of <HI>cau&s;e and effect;</HI> nor can we otherwi&s;e have any &s;ecurity, that the object is not chang'd upon us, how|ever much the new object may re&s;emble that which was formerly pre&s;ent to the &s;en|&s;es. Whenever we di&s;cover &s;uch a perfect re&s;emblance, we con&s;ider, whether it be common in that &s;pecies of objects; whether po&s;&s;ibly or probably any cau&s;e cou'd operate in producing the change and re&s;emblance; and according as we determine concerning the&s;e cau&s;es and effects, we form our judg|ment concerning the identity of the object.</P>
<P>HERE then it appears, that of tho&s;e three relations, which depend not upon the mere ideas, the only one, that can be trac'd beyond our &s;en&s;es, and informs us of exi&s;|tences and objects, which we do not &s;ee or feel, is <HI>cau&s;ation.</HI> This relation, therefore, we &s;hall endavour to explain fully before we leave the &s;ubject of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>TO BEGIN regularly, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the idea of <HI>cau&s;ation,</HI> and &s;ee from what
<PB N="135" REF="146">
origin it is deriv'd. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on ju&s;tly, without under&s;tanding per|fectly the idea concerning which we rea|&s;on; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible perfectly to un|der&s;tand any idea, without tracing it up to its origin, and examining that primary im|pre&s;&s;ion, from which it ari&s;es. The exa|mination of the impre&s;&s;ion be&s;tows a clear|ne&s;s on the idea; and the examination of the idea be&s;tows a like clearne&s;s on all our rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>LET us therefore ca&s;t our eye on any two objects, which we call cau&s;e and effect, and turn them on all &s;ides, in order to find that impre&s;&s;ion, which produces an idea of &s;uch prodigious con&s;equence. At fir&s;t &s;ight I perceive, that I mu&s;t not &s;earch for it in any of the particular <HI>qualities</HI> of the objects; &s;ince, which-ever of the&s;e qualities I pitch on, I find &s;ome object, that is not po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, and yet falls under the denomination of cau&s;e or effect. And indeed there is no|thing exi&s;tent, either externally or internally, which is not to be con&s;ider'd either as a cau&s;e or an effect; tho' 'tis plain there is no one quality, which univer&s;ally belongs to all beings, and gives them a title to that de|nomination.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="147">
THE idea, then, of cau&s;ation mu&s;t be deriv'd from &s;ome <HI>relation</HI> among objects; and that relation we mu&s;t now endeavour to di&s;cover. I find in the fir&s;t place, that whatever objects are con&s;ider'd as cau&s;es or effects, are <HI>contiguous;</HI> and that nothing can operate in a time or place, which is ever &s;o little remov'd from tho&s;e of its exi&s;tence. Tho' di&s;tant objects may &s;ometimes &s;eem productive of each other, they are com|monly found upon examination to be link'd by a chain of cau&s;es, which are contiguous among them&s;elves, and to the di&s;tant ob|jects; and when in any particular in&s;tance we cannot di&s;cover this connexion, we &s;till pre&s;ume it to exi&s;t. We may therefore con|&s;ider the relation of CONTIGUITY as e&s;&s;en|tial to that of cau&s;ation; at lea&s;t may &s;up|po&s;e it &s;uch, according to the general opi|nion, till we can find a more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part IV. Sect. 5.</NOTE> proper oc|ca&s;ion to clear up this matter, by examin|ing what objects are or are not &s;u&s;ceptible of juxta-po&s;ition and conjunction.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd relation I &s;hall ob&s;erve as e&s;|&s;ential to cau&s;es and effects, is not &s;o uni|ver&s;ally acknowledg'd, but is liable to &s;ome controver&s;y. 'Tis that of PRIORITY of time in the cau&s;e before the effect. Some
<PB N="137" REF="148">
pretend that 'tis not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary a cau&s;e &s;hou'd precede its effect; but that any object or action, in the very fir&s;t moment of its exi&s;tence, may exert its productive quality, and give ri&s;e to another object or action, perfectly co-temporary with it&s;elf. But be&s;ide that experience in mo&s;t in&s;tances &s;eems to contradict this opinion, we may e&s;tabli&s;h the relation of priority by a kind of inference or rea&s;oning. 'Tis an e&s;tab|li&s;h'd maxim both in natural and moral philo&s;ophy, that an object, which exi&s;ts for any time in its full perfection without pro|ducing another, is not its &s;ole cau&s;e; but is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome other principle, which pu&s;hes it from its &s;tate of inactivity, and makes it exert that energy, of which it was &s;ecretly po&s;&s;e&s;t. Now if any cau&s;e may be perfectly co-temporary with its effect, 'tis cer|tain, according to this maxim, that they mu&s;t all of them be &s;o; &s;ince any one of them, which retards its operation for a &s;ingle moment, exerts not it&s;elf at that very indi|vidual time, in which it might have ope|rated; and therefore is no proper cau&s;e. The con&s;equence of this wou'd be no le&s;s than the de&s;truction of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es, which we ob&s;erve in the world; and indeed, the utter annihilation of time. For
<PB N="138" REF="149">
if one cau&s;e were co-temporary with its effect, and this effect with <HI>its</HI> effect, and &s;o on, 'tis plain there wou'd be no &s;uch thing as &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and all objects mu&s;t be co|exi&s;tent.</P>
<P>IF this argument appear &s;atisfactory, 'tis well. If not, I beg the reader to allow me the &s;ame liberty, which I have us'd in the preceding ca&s;e, of &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;uch. For he &s;hall find, that the affair is of no great importance.</P>
<P>HAVING thus di&s;cover'd or &s;uppos'd the two relations of <HI>contiguity</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> to be e&s;&s;ential to cau&s;es and effects, I find I am &s;topt &s;hort, and can proceed no farther in con&s;idering any &s;ingle in&s;tance of cau&s;e and effect. Motion in one body is regarded upon impul&s;e as the cau&s;e of motion in ano|ther. When we con&s;ider the&s;e objects with the utmo&s;t attention, we find only that the one body approaches the other; and that the motion of it precedes that of the other, but without any &s;en&s;ible interval. 'Tis in vain to rack our&s;elves with <HI>farther</HI> thought and reflection upon this &s;ubject. We can go no <HI>farther</HI> in con&s;idering this particular in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>SHOU'D any one leave this in&s;tance, and pretend to define a cau&s;e, by &s;aying it is
<PB N="139" REF="150">
&s;omething productive of another, 'tis evident he wou'd &s;ay nothing. For what does he mean by <HI>production?</HI> Can he give any defi|nition of it, that will not be the &s;ame with that of cau&s;ation? If he can; I de&s;ire it may be produc'd. If he cannot; he here runs in a circle, and gives a &s;ynonimous term in|&s;tead of a definition.</P>
<P>SHALL we then re&s;t contented with the&s;e two relations of contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as affording a compleat idea of cau&s;ation? By no means. An object may be contiguous and prior to another, without being con&s;i|der'd as its cau&s;e. There is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be taken into con&s;ideration; and that relation is of much greater im|portance, than any of the other two above|mention'd.</P>
<P>HERE again I turn the object on all &s;ides, in order to di&s;cover the nature of this nece&s;&s;ary connexion, and find the impre&s;&s;ion, or impre&s;&s;ions, from which its idea may be deriv'd. When I ca&s;t my eye on the <HI>known qualities</HI> of objects, I immediately di&s;cover that the relation of cau&s;e and effect depends not in the lea&s;t on <HI>them.</HI> When I con&s;ider their <HI>relations,</HI> I can find none but tho&s;e of contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which I have al|ready regarded as imperfect and un&s;ati&s;|factory.

<P>FIRST, For what rea&s;on we pronounce it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> that every thing who&s;e exi|&s;tence has a beginning, &s;hou'd al&s;o have a cau&s;e?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Why a cau&s;e is always nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t que&s;tion con|cerning the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e: 'Tis a general maxim in philo&s;ophy, that <HI>what|ever begins to exi&s;t, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e of exi&s;|tence.</HI> This is commonly taken for granted
<PB N="143" REF="153">
in all rea&s;onings, without any proof given or demanded. 'Tis &s;uppos'd to be founded on intuition, and to be one of tho&s;e max|ims, which tho' they may be deny'd with the lips, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for men in their hearts really to doubt of. But if we ex|amine this maxim by the idea of knowledge above-explain'd, we &s;hall di&s;cover in it no mark of any &s;uch intuitive certainty; but on the contrary &s;hall find, that 'tis of a nature quite foreign to that &s;pecies of conviction.</P>
<P>ALL certainty ari&s;es from the compari|&s;on of ideas, and from the di&s;covery of &s;uch relations as are unalterable, &s;o long as the ideas continue the &s;ame. The&s;e relations are <HI>re&s;emblance, proportions in quantity and number, degrees of any quality, and contra|riety;</HI> none of which are imply'd in this propo&s;ition, <HI>Whatever has a beginning has al&s;o a cau&s;e of exi&s;tence.</HI> That propo&s;i|tion therefore is not intuitively certain. At lea&s;t any one, who wou'd a&s;&s;ert it to be in|tuitively certain, mu&s;t deny the&s;e to be the only infallible relations, and mu&s;t find &s;ome other relation of that kind to be imply'd in it; which it will then be time enough to examine.</P>
<P>BUT here is an argument, which proves at once, that the foregoing propo&s;ition is
<PB N="143" REF="154">
neither intuitively nor demon&s;trably certain. We can never demon&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e to every new exi&s;tence, or new mo|dification of exi&s;tence, without &s;hewing at the &s;ame time the impo&s;&s;ibility there is, that any thing can ever begin to exi&s;t without &s;ome productive principle; and where the latter propo&s;ition cannot be prov'd, we mu&s;t de&s;pair of ever being able to prove the for|mer. Now that the latter propo&s;ition is utterly incapable of a demon&s;trative proof, we may &s;atisfy our&s;elves by con&s;idering, that as all di&s;tinct ideas are &s;eparable from each other, and as the ideas of cau&s;e and effect are evidently di&s;tinct, 'twill be ea&s;y for us to conceive any object to be non-exi&s;tent this moment, and exi&s;tent the next, with|out conjoining to it the di&s;tinct idea of a cau&s;e or productive principle. The &s;epara|tion, therefore, of the idea of a cau&s;e from that of a beginning of exi&s;tence, is plainly po&s;&s;ible for the imagination; and con&s;equent|ly the actual &s;eparation of the&s;e objects is &s;o far po&s;&s;ible, that it implies no contra|diction nor ab&s;urdity; and is therefore in|capable of being refuted by any rea&s;oning from mere ideas; without which 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible to demon&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="155">
ACCORDINGLY we &s;hall find upon ex|amination, that every demon&s;tration, which has been produc'd for the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e, is fallacious and &s;ophi&s;tical. All the points of time and place,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hobbes.</HI></NOTE> &s;ay &s;ome philo&s;ophers, in which we can &s;uppo&s;e any object to be|gin to exi&s;t, are in them&s;elves equal; and unle&s;s there be &s;ome cau&s;e, which is pecu|liar to one time and to one place, and which by that means determines and fixes the exi&s;tence, it mu&s;t remain in eternal &s;u&s;|pence; and the object can never begin to be, for want of &s;omething to fix its beginning. But I a&s;k; Is there any more difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing the time and place to be fix'd without a cau&s;e, than to &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;|tence to be determin'd in that manner? The fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs on this &s;ub|ject is always, <HI>whether</HI> the object &s;hall exi&s;t or not: The next, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> it &s;hall begin to exi&s;t. If the removal of a cau&s;e be intuitively ab&s;urd in the one ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;o in the other: And if that ab&s;urdity be not clear without a proof in the one ca&s;e, it will equally require one in the other. The ab&s;urdity, then, of the one &s;uppo&s;ition can never be a proof of that of the other; &s;ince
<PB N="145" REF="156">
they are both upon the &s;ame footing, and mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by the &s;ame rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd argument,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> and others.</NOTE> which I find us'd on this head, labours under an equal difficulty. Every thing, 'tis &s;aid, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e; for if any thing wanted a cau&s;e, <HI>it</HI> wou'd produce <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> that is, exi&s;t before it exi&s;ted; which is impo&s;&s;ible. But this rea&s;oning is plainly unconclu&s;ive; becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es, that in our denial of a cau&s;e we &s;till grant what we expre&s;ly deny, <HI>viz.</HI> that there mu&s;t be a cau&s;e; which therefore is taken to be the object it&s;elf; and <HI>that,</HI> no doubt, is an evident contradiction. But to &s;ay that any thing is produc'd, or to ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf more properly, comes into ex|i&s;tence, without a cau&s;e, is not to affirm, that 'tis it&s;elf its own cau&s;e; but on the contrary in excluding all external cau&s;es, excludes <HI>a fortiori</HI> the thing it&s;elf, which is created. An object, that exi&s;ts ab&s;olutely without any cau&s;e, certainly is not its own cau&s;e; and when you a&s;&s;ert, that the one follows from the other, you &s;uppo&s;e the very point in que&s;tion, and take it for grant|ed, that 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible any thing can ever begin to exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, but that upon the exclu&s;ion of one productive
<PB N="146" REF="157">
principle, we mu&s;t &s;till have recour&s;e to another.</P>
<P>'TIS exactly the &s;ame ca&s;e with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI></NOTE> third argument, which has been employ'd to de|mon&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e. What|ever is produc'd without any cau&s;e, is pro|duc'd by <HI>nothing;</HI> or in other words, has nothing for its cau&s;e. But nothing can ne|ver be a cau&s;e, no more than it can be &s;omething, or equal to two right angles. By the &s;ame intuition, that we perceive nothing not to be equal to two right angles, or not to be &s;omething, we perceive, that it can never be a cau&s;e; and con&s;equently mu&s;t perceive, that every object has a real cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to employ many words in &s;hewing the weak|ne&s;s of this argument, after what I have &s;aid of the foregoing. They are all of them founded on the &s;ame fallacy, and are de|riv'd from the &s;ame turn of thought. 'Tis &s;ufficient only to ob&s;erve, that when we exclude all cau&s;es we really do exclude them, and neither &s;uppo&s;e nothing nor the object it&s;elf to be the cau&s;es of the exi&s;tence; and con&s;equently can draw no argument from the ab&s;urdity of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions to prove
<PB N="147" REF="158">
the ab&s;urdity of that exclu&s;ion. If every thing mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, it follows, that upon the exclu&s;ion of other cau&s;es we mu&s;t accept of the object it&s;elf or of nothing as cau&s;es. But 'tis the very point in que&s;tion, whether every thing mu&s;t have a cau&s;e or not; and therefore, according to all ju&s;t rea&s;oning, it ought never to be taken for granted.</P>
<P>THEY are &s;till more frivolous, who &s;ay, that every effect mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, becau&s;e 'tis imply'd in the very idea of effect. Eve|ry effect nece&s;&s;arily pre-&s;uppo&s;es a cau&s;e; effect being a relative term, of which cau&s;e is the correlative. But this does not prove, that every being mu&s;t be preceded by a cau&s;e; no more than it follows, becau&s;e every hu&s;band mu&s;t have a wife, that there|fore every man mu&s;t be marry'd. The true &s;tate of the que&s;tion is, whether every ob|ject, which begins to exi&s;t, mu&s;t owe its exi&s;tence to a cau&s;e; and this I a&s;&s;ert neither to be intuitively nor demon&s;tratively certain, and hope to have prov'd it &s;ufficiently by the foregoing arguments.</P>
<P>SINCE it is not from knowledge or any &s;cientific rea&s;oning, that we derive the opi|nion of the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e to every new production, that opinion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily

ari&s;e from ob&s;ervation and experience. The next que&s;tion, then, &s;hou'd naturally be, <HI>how experience gives ri&s;e to &s;uch a principle?</HI> But as I find it will be more convenient to &s;ink this que&s;tion in the following, <HI>Why we con|clude, that &s;uch particular cau&s;es mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily have &s;uch particular effects, and why we form an inference from one to another?</HI> we &s;hall make that the &s;ubject of our fu|ture enquiry.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the component parts of our rea&s;on|ings concerning cau&s;e and effect.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' the mind in its rea&s;onings from cau&s;es or effects carries its view be|yond tho&s;e objects, which it &s;ees or remem|bers, it mu&s;t never lo&s;e &s;ight of them en|tirely, nor rea&s;on merely upon its own ideas, without &s;ome mixture of impre&s;&s;ions, or at lea&s;t of ideas of the memory, which are equivalent to impre&s;&s;ions. When we infer effects from cau&s;es, we mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h the exi&s;tence of the&s;e cau&s;es; which we have only two ways of doing, either by an im|mediate
<PB N="149" REF="160">
perception of our memory or &s;en&s;es, or by an inference from other cau&s;es; which cau&s;es again we mu&s;t a&s;certain in the &s;ame manner, either by a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, or by an inference from <HI>their</HI> cau&s;es, and &s;o on, till we arrive at &s;ome object, which we &s;ee or remember. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to carry on our inferences <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and the only thing, that can &s;top them, is an impre&s;&s;ion of the memory or &s;en&s;es, beyond which there is no room for doubt or en|quiry.</P>
<P>To give an in&s;tance of this, we may chu&s;e any point of hi&s;tory, and con&s;ider for what rea&s;on we either believe or reject it. Thus we believe that CAESAR was kill'd in the &s;enate-hou&s;e on the <HI>ides</HI> of <HI>March;</HI> and that becau&s;e this fact is e&s;tabli&s;h'd on the un|animous te&s;timony of hi&s;torians, who agree to a&s;&s;ign this preci&s;e time and place to that event. Here are certain characters and let|ters pre&s;ent either to our memory or &s;en&s;es; which characters we likewi&s;e remember to have been us'd as the &s;igns of certain ideas; and the&s;e ideas were either in the minds of &s;uch as were immediately pre&s;ent at that action, and receiv'd the ideas directly from its exi&s;tence; or they were deriv'd from the te&s;timony of others, and that again from
<PB N="150" REF="161">
another te&s;timony, by a vi&s;ible gradation, 'till we arrive at tho&s;e who were eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es and &s;pectators of the event. 'Tis ob|vious all this chain of argument or con|nexion of cau&s;es and effects, is at fir&s;t found|ed on tho&s;e characters or letters, which are &s;een or remember'd, and that without the authority either of the memory or &s;en&s;es our whole rea&s;oning wou'd be chimerical and without foundation. Every link of the chain wou'd in that ca&s;e hang upon another; but there wou'd not be any thing fix'd to one end of it, capable of &s;u&s;taining the whole; and con&s;equently there wou'd be no belief nor evidence. And this actually is the ca&s;e with all <HI>hypothetical</HI> arguments, or rea&s;on|ings upon a &s;uppo&s;ition; there being in them, neither any pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, nor belief of a real exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I NEED not ob&s;erve, that 'tis no ju&s;t ob|jection to the pre&s;ent doctrine, that we can rea&s;on upon our pa&s;t conclu&s;ions or princi|ples, without having recour&s;e to tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions, from which they fir&s;t aro&s;e. For even &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions &s;hou'd be entirely effac'd from the memory, the conviction they produc'd may &s;till remain; and 'tis equally true, that all rea&s;onings con|cerning cau&s;es and effects are originally de|riv'd
<PB N="151" REF="162">
from &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion; in the &s;ame manner, as the a&s;&s;urance of a demon&s;tra|tion proceeds always from a compari&s;on of ideas, tho' it may continue after the com|pari&s;on is forgot.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es and memory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this kind of rea&s;oning, then, from cau&s;ation, we employ materials, which are of a mix'd and heterogeneous nature, and which, however connected, are yet e&s;|&s;entially different from each other. All our arguments concerning cau&s;es and effects con|&s;i&s;t both of an impre&s;&s;ion of the memory or &s;en&s;es, and of the idea of that exi&s;tence, which produces the object of the impre&s;&s;ion, or is produc'd by it. Here therefore we have three things to explain, <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> The original impre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The tran&s;ition to the idea of the connected cau&s;e or effect. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The nature and quali|ties of that idea.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e <HI>impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> which ari&s;e from the <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> their ultimate cau&s;e is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human
<PB N="152" REF="163">
rea&s;on, and 'twill always be impo&s;&s;ible to de|cide with certainty, whether they ari&s;e im|mediately from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind, or are deriv'd from the author of our being. Nor is &s;uch a que&s;tion any way material to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. We may draw inferences from the coherence of our perceptions, whe|ther they be true or fal&s;e; whether they repre&s;ent nature ju&s;tly, or be mere illu&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;earch for the characteri&s;tic, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>memory</HI> from the imagination, we mu&s;t immediately perceive, that it cannot lie in the &s;imple ideas it pre|&s;ents to us; &s;ince both the&s;e faculties bor|row their &s;imple ideas from the impre&s;&s;ions, and can never go beyond the&s;e original percep|tions. The&s;e faculties are as little di&s;tingui&s;h'd from each other by the arrangement of their complex ideas. For tho' it be a peculiar property of the memory to pre&s;erve the original order and po&s;ition of its ideas, while the imagination tran&s;po&s;es and changes them, as it plea&s;es; yet this difference is not &s;uffi|cient to di&s;tingui&s;h them in their operation, or make us know the one from the other; it being impo&s;&s;ible to recal the pa&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions, in order to compare them with our
<PB N="153" REF="164" MS="y">
pre&s;ent ideas, and &s;ee whether their arrange|ment be exactly &s;imilar. Since therefore the memory is known, neither by the order of its <HI>complex</HI> ideas, nor the nature of its <HI>&s;imple</HI> ones; it follows, that the difference betwixt it and the imagination lies in its &s;uperior force and vivacity. A man may indulge his fancy in feigning any pa&s;t &s;cene of adven|tures; nor wou'd there be any po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;tingui&s;hing this from a remembrance of a like kind, were not the ideas of the ima|gination fainter and more ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>A PAINTER, who intended to repre&s;ent a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion of any kind, wou'd endeavour to get a &s;ight of a per&s;on actua|ted by a like emotion, in order to enliven his ideas, and give them a force and viva|city &s;uperior to what is found in tho&s;e, which are mere fictions of the imagination. The more recent this memory is, the clearer is the idea; and when after a long interval he would return to the contemplation of his object, he always finds its idea to be much decay'd, if not wholly obliterated. We are frequently in doubt concerning the ideas of the memory, as they become very weak and feeble; and are at a lo&s;s to determine whether any image proceeds from the fancy or the memory, when it is not drawn in
<PB N="154" REF="165">
&s;uch lively colours as di&s;tingui&s;h that latter faculty. I think, I remember &s;uch an event, &s;ays one; but am not &s;ure. A long tract of time has almo&s;t worn out of my me|mory, and leaves me uncertain whether or not it be the pure offspring of my fancy.</P>
<P>AND as an idea of the memory, by lo&s;ing its force and vivacity, may degene|rate to &s;uch a degree, as to be taken for an idea of the imagination; &s;o on the other hand an idea of the imagination may acquire &s;uch a force and vivacity, as to pa&s;s for an idea of the memory, and counterfeit its ef|fects on the belief and judgment. This is noted in the ca&s;e of liars; who by the fre|quent repetition of their lies, come at la&s;t to believe and remember them, as realities; cu&s;tom and habit having in this ca&s;e, as in many others, the &s;ame influence on the mind as nature, and infixing the idea with equal force and vigour.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, that the <HI>belief</HI> or <HI>a&s;|&s;ent,</HI> which always attends the memory and &s;en&s;es, is nothing but the vivacity of tho&s;e perceptions they pre&s;ent; and that this a|lone di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the imagina|tion. To believe is in this ca&s;e to feel an immediate impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;es, or a re|petition of that impre&s;&s;ion in the memory.
<PB N="155" REF="166">
'Tis merely the force and liveline&s;s of the perception, which con&s;titutes the fir&s;t act of the judgment, and lays the foundation of that rea&s;oning, which we build upon it, when we trace the relation of cau&s;e and effect.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Of the inference from the impre&s;&s;ion to the idea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that in tracing this relation, the inference we draw from cau&s;e to effect, is not deriv'd mere|ly from a &s;urvey of the&s;e particular objects, and from &s;uch a penetration into their e&s;|&s;ences as may di&s;cover the dependance of the one upon the other. There is no object, which implies the exi&s;tence of any other if we con&s;ider the&s;e objects in them&s;elves, and never look beyond the ideas which we form of them. Such an inference wou'd amount to knowledge, and wou'd imply the ab&s;o|lute contradiction and impo&s;&s;ibility of con|ceiving any thing different. But as all di&s;tinct ideas are &s;eparable, 'tis evident there can be no impo&s;&s;ibility of that kind. When we pa&s;s from a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion to the idea of any object, we might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;eparated the idea from the impre&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="156" REF="167">
have &s;ub&s;tituted any other idea in its room.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore by EXPERIENCE only, that we can infer the exi&s;tence of one ob|ject from that of another. The nature of experience is this. We remember to have had frequent in&s;tances of the exi&s;tence of one &s;pecies of objects; and al&s;o remember, that the individuals of another &s;pecies of objects have always attended them, and have exi&s;ted in a regular order of con|tiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with regard to them. Thus we remember to have &s;een that &s;pecies of object we call <HI>flame,</HI> and to have felt that &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ation we call <HI>heat.</HI> We likewi&s;e call to mind their con|&s;tant conjunction in all pa&s;t in&s;tances. With|out any farther ceremony, we call the one <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and the other <HI>effect,</HI> and infer the ex|i&s;tence of the one from that of the other. In all tho&s;e in&s;tances, from which we learn the conjunction of particular cau&s;es and ef|fects, both the cau&s;es and effects have been perceiv'd by the &s;en&s;es, and are remember'd: But in all ca&s;es, wherein we rea&s;on concern|ing them, there is only one perceiv'd or remember'd, and the other is &s;upply'd in conformity to our pa&s;t experience.</P>
<P>THUS in advancing we have in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;cover'd a new relation betwixt cau&s;e and
<PB N="157" REF="168">
effect, when we lea&s;t expected it, and were entirely employ'd upon another &s;ubject. This relation is their CONSTANT CON|JUNCTION. Contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are not &s;ufficient to make us pronounce any two objects to be cau&s;e and effect, unle&s;s we perceive, that the&s;e two relations are pre|&s;erv'd in &s;everal in&s;tances. We may now &s;ee the advantage of quitting the direct &s;ur|vey of this relation, in order to di&s;cover the nature of that <HI>nece&s;&s;ary connexion,</HI> which makes &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of it. There are hopes, that by this means we may at la&s;t arrive at our propos'd end; tho' to tell the truth, this new-di&s;cover'd relation of a con|&s;tant conjunction &s;eems to advance us but very little in our way. For it implies no more than this, that like objects have always been plac'd in like relations of contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and it &s;eems evident, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight, that by this means we can never di&s;cover any new idea, and can only multiply, but not enlarge the objects of our mind. It may be thought, that what we learn not from one object, we can never learn from a hundred, which are all of the &s;ame kind, and are perfectly re&s;embling in every circum&s;tance. As our &s;en&s;es &s;hew us in one in&s;tance two bodies, or motions, or qualities
<PB N="158" REF="169">
in certain relations of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and conti|guity; &s;o our memory pre&s;ents us only with a multitude of in&s;tances, wherein we al|ways find like bodies, motions, or qualities in like relations. From the mere repetition of any pa&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, even to infinity, there never will ari&s;e any new original idea, &s;uch as that of a nece&s;&s;ary connexion; and the number of impre&s;&s;ions has in this ca&s;e no more effect than if we confin'd our&s;elves to one only. But tho' this rea&s;oning &s;eems ju&s;t and obvious; yet as it wou'd be folly to de&s;pair too &s;oon, we &s;hall continue the thread of our di&s;cour&s;e; and having found, that after the di&s;covery of the con&s;tant con|junction of any objects, we always draw an in|ference from one object to another, we &s;hall now examine the nature of that inference, and of the tran&s;ition from the impre&s;&s;ion to the idea. Perhaps 'twill appear in the end, that the nece&s;&s;ary connexion depends on the inference, in&s;tead of the inference's depend|ing on the nece&s;&s;ary connexion.</P>
<P>SINCE it appears, that the tran&s;ition from an impre&s;&s;ion pre&s;ent to the memory or &s;en&s;es to the idea of an object, which we call cau&s;e or effect, is founded on pa&s;t <HI>experience,</HI> and on our remembrance of their <HI>con&s;tant conjunction,</HI> the next que&s;tion
<PB N="159" REF="170">
is, Whether experience produces the idea by means of the under&s;tanding or imagination; whether we are determin'd by rea&s;on to make the tran&s;ition, or by a certain a&s;&s;ociation and relation of perceptions. If rea&s;on determin'd us, it wou'd proceed upon that principle, <HI>that in&s;tances, of which we have had no expe|rience, mu&s;t re&s;emble tho&s;e, of which we have had experience, and that the cour&s;e of nature continues always uniformly the &s;ame.</HI> In or|der therefore to clear up this matter, let us con&s;ider all the arguments, upon which &s;uch a propo&s;ition may be &s;uppos'd to be found|ed; and as the&s;e mu&s;t be deriv'd either from <HI>knowledge</HI> or <HI>probability,</HI> let us ca&s;t our eye on each of the&s;e degrees of evidence, and &s;ee whether they afford any ju&s;t conclu&s;ion of this nature.</P>
<P>OUR foregoing method of rea&s;oning will ea&s;ily convince us, that there can be no <HI>de|mon&s;trative</HI> arguments to prove, <HI>that tho&s;e in&s;tances, of which we have had no experi|ence, re&s;emble tho&s;e, of which we have had experience.</HI> We can at lea&s;t conceive a change in the cour&s;e of nature; which &s;ufficiently proves, that &s;uch a change is not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. To form a clear idea of any thing, is an undeniable argument for its po&s;&s;ibi|lity,
<PB N="160" REF="171">
and is alone a refutation of any pre|tended demon&s;tration again&s;t it.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY, as it di&s;covers not the relations of ideas, con&s;ider'd as &s;uch, but only tho&s;e of objects, mu&s;t in &s;ome re&s;pects be founded on the impre&s;&s;ions of our me|mory and &s;en&s;es, and in &s;ome re&s;pects on our ideas. Were there no mixture of any im|pre&s;&s;ion in our probable rea&s;onings, the con|clu&s;ion wou'd be entirely chimerical: And were there no mixture of ideas, the action of the mind, in ob&s;erving the relation, wou'd, properly &s;peaking, be &s;en&s;ation, not rea|&s;oning. 'Tis therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that in all probable rea&s;onings there be &s;omething pre|&s;ent to the mind, either &s;een or remember'd; and that from this we infer &s;omething con|nected with it, which is not &s;een nor re|member'd.</P>
<P>THE only connexion or relation of ob|jects, which can lead us beyond the imme|diate impre&s;&s;ions of our memory and &s;en|&s;es, is that of cau&s;e and effect; and that becau&s;e 'tis the only one, on which we can found a ju&s;t inference from one object to another. The idea of cau&s;e and effect is deriv'd from <HI>experience,</HI> which informs us, that &s;uch particular objects, in all pa&s;t in|&s;tances, have been con&s;tantly conjoin'd with
<PB N="161" REF="172">
each other: And as an object &s;imilar to one of the&s;e is &s;uppos'd to be immediately pre|&s;ent in its impre&s;&s;ion, we thence pre&s;ume on the exi&s;tence of one &s;imilar to its u&s;ual attendant. According to this account of things, which is, I think, in every point unque&s;tionable, probability is founded on the pre&s;umption of a re&s;emblance betwixt tho&s;e objects, of which we have had expe|rience, and tho&s;e, of which we have had none; and therefore 'tis impo&s;&s;ible this pre|&s;umption can ari&s;e from probability. The &s;ame principle cannot be both the cau&s;e and effect of another; and this is, perhaps, the only propo&s;ition concerning that relation, which is either intuitively or demon&s;tratively certain.</P>
<P>SHOU'D any one think to elude this ar|gument; and without determining whether our rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject be deriv'd from demon&s;tration or probability, pretend that all conclu&s;ions from cau&s;es and effects are bullt on &s;olid rea&s;oning: I can only de&s;ire, that this rea&s;oning may be produc'd, in or|der to be expos'd to our examination. It may, perhaps, be &s;aid, that after experience of the con&s;tant conjunction of certain ob|jects, we rea&s;on in the following manner. Such an object is always found to produce
<PB N="163" REF="173">
another. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible it cou'd have this effect, if it was not endow'd with a power of production. The power nece&s;&s;arily im|plies the effect; and therefore there is a ju&s;t foundation for drawing a conclu&s;ion from the exi&s;tence of one object to that of its u&s;ual attendant. The pa&s;t production im|plies a power: The power implies a new production: And the new production is what we infer from the power and the pa&s;t pro|duction.</P>
<P>'TWERE ea&s;y for me to &s;hew the weak|ne&s;s of this rea&s;oning, were I willing to make u&s;e of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, I have already made, that the idea of <HI>production</HI> is the &s;ame with that of <HI>cau&s;ation,</HI> and that no exi&s;tence certainly and demon&s;tratively implies a power in any other object; or were it proper to anticipate what I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to remark afterwards concern|ing the idea we form of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>efficacy.</HI> But as &s;uch a method of proceeding may &s;eem either to weaken my &s;y&s;tem, by re&s;t|ing one part of it on another, or to breed a confu&s;ion in my rea&s;oning, I &s;hall endea|vour to maintain my pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ertion with|out any &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall therefore be allow'd for a mo|ment, that the production of one object by
<PB N="163" REF="174">
another in any one in&s;tance implies a power; and that this power is connected with its effect. But it having been already prov'd, that the power lies not in the &s;en&s;ible qua|lities of the cau&s;e; and there being nothing but the &s;en&s;ible qualities pre&s;ent to us; I a&s;k, why in other in&s;tances you pre&s;ume that the &s;ame power &s;till exi&s;ts, merely up|on the appearance of the&s;e qualities? Your appeal to pa&s;t experience decides nothing in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and at the utmo&s;t can only prove, that that very object, which produc'd any other, was at that very in&s;tant endow'd with &s;uch a power; but can never prove, that the &s;ame power mu&s;t continue in the &s;ame object or collection of &s;en&s;ible qualities; much le&s;s, that a like power is always conjoin'd with like &s;en&s;ible qualities. Shou'd it be &s;aid, that we have experience, that the &s;ame power continues united with the &s;ame object, and that like objects are endow'd with like powers, I wou'd renew my que&s;|tion, <HI>why from this experience we form any conclu&s;ion beyond tho&s;e pa&s;t in&s;tances, of which we have had experience.</HI> If you an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the &s;ame manner as the pre|ceding, your an&s;wer gives &s;till occa&s;ion to a new que&s;tion of the &s;ame kind, even <HI>in infinitum;</HI> which clearly proves, that the
<PB N="164" REF="175">
foregoing rea&s;oning had no ju&s;t founda|tion.</P>
<P>THUS not only our rea&s;on fails us in the di&s;covery of the <HI>ultimate connexion</HI> of cau&s;es and effects, but even after experience has inform'd us of their <HI>con&s;tant conjunction,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;atisfy our&s;elves by our rea&s;on, why we &s;hou'd extend that expe|rience beyond tho&s;e particular in&s;tances, which have fallen under our ob&s;ervation. We &s;uppo&s;e, but are never able to prove, that there mu&s;t be a re&s;emblance betwixt tho&s;e objects, of which we have had expe|rience, and tho&s;e which lie beyond the reach of our di&s;covery.</P>
<P>WE have already taken notice of certain relations, which make us pa&s;s from one ob|ject to another, even tho' there be no rea&s;on to determine us to that tran&s;ition; and this we may e&s;tabli&s;h for a general rule, that wherever the mind con&s;tantly and uniformly makes a tran&s;ition without any rea&s;on, it is influenc'd by the&s;e relations. Now this is exactly the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Rea&s;on can never &s;hew us the connexion of one object with another, tho' aided by experience, and the ob&s;ervation of their con&s;tant conjunction in all pa&s;t in&s;tances. When the mind, there|fore, pa&s;&s;es from the idea or impre&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="165" REF="176">
one object to the idea or belief of another, it is not determin'd by rea&s;on, but by cer|tain principles, which a&s;&s;ociate together the ideas of the&s;e objects, and unite them in the imagination. Had ideas no more union in the fancy than objects &s;eem to have to the under&s;tanding, we cou'd never draw any inference from cau&s;es to effects, nor repo&s;e belief in any matter of fact. The inference, therefore, depends &s;olely on the union of ideas.</P>
<P>THE principles of union among ideas, I have reduc'd to three general ones, and have a&s;&s;erted, that the idea or impre&s;&s;ion of any object naturally introduces the idea of any other object, that is re&s;embling, conti|guous to, or connected with it. The&s;e principles I allow to be neither the <HI>infalli|ble</HI> nor the <HI>&s;ole</HI> cau&s;es of an union among ideas. They are not the infallible cau&s;es. For one may fix his attention during &s;ome time on any one object without looking farther. They are not the &s;ole cau&s;es. For the thought has evidently a very irregular motion in run|ning along its objects, and may leap from the heavens to the earth, from one end of the creation to the other, without any cer|tain method or order. But tho' I allow this weakne&s;s in the&s;e three relations, and
<PB N="166" REF="177">
this irregularity in the imagination; yet I a&s;&s;ert that the only <HI>general</HI> principles, which a&s;&s;ociate ideas, are re&s;emblance, contiguity and cau&s;ation.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed a principle of union among ideas, which at fir&s;t &s;ight may be e&s;teem'd different from any of the&s;e, but will be found at the bottom to depend on the &s;ame origin. When ev'ry individual of any &s;pecies of objects is found by experience to be con&s;tantly united with an individual of another &s;pecies, the appearance of any new individual of either &s;pecies naturally conveys the thought to its u&s;ual attendant. Thus becau&s;e &s;uch a particular idea is com|monly annex'd to &s;uch a particular word, nothing is requir'd but the hearing of that word to produce the corre&s;pondent idea; and 'twill &s;carce be po&s;&s;ible for the mind, by its utmo&s;t efforts, to prevent that tran&s;i|tion. In this ca&s;e it is not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that upon hearing &s;uch a particular &s;ound, we &s;hou'd reflect on any pa&s;t expe|rience, and con&s;ider what idea has been u&s;ually connected with the &s;ound. The imagination of it&s;elf &s;upplies the place of this reflection, and is &s;o accu&s;tom'd to pa&s;s from the word to the idea, that it inter|po&s;es not a moment's delay betwixt the
<PB N="167" REF="178">
hearing of the one, and the conception of the other.</P>
<P>BUT tho' I acknowledge this to be a true principle of a&s;&s;ociation among ideas, I a&s;&s;ert it to be the very &s;ame with that be|twixt the ideas of cau&s;e and effect, and to be an e&s;&s;ential part in all our rea&s;onings from that relation. We have no other no|tion of cau&s;e and effect, but that of certain objects, which have been <HI>always conjoin'd</HI> together, and which in all pa&s;t in&s;tan|ces have been found in&s;eparable. We can|not penetrate into the rea&s;on of the con|junction. We only ob&s;erve the thing it&s;elf, and always find that from the con&s;tant con|junction the objects acquire an union in the imagination. When the impre&s;&s;ion of one becomes pre&s;ent to us, we immediately form an idea of its u&s;ual attendant; and con&s;e|quently we may e&s;tabli&s;h this as one part of the definition of an opinion or belief, that 'tis <HI>an idea related to or a&s;&s;ociated with a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>THUS tho' cau&s;ation be a <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> relation, as implying contiguity, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and con&s;tant conjunction, yet 'tis only &s;o far as it is a <HI>natural</HI> relation, and produces an union among our ideas, that we are able to rea&s;on upon it, or draw any inference from it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. <HI>Of the nature of the idea or belief.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE idea of an object is an e&s;&s;ential part of the belief of it, but not the whole. We conceive many things, which we do not believe. In order then to di&s;|cover more fully the nature of belief, or the qualities of tho&s;e ideas we a&s;&s;ent to, let us weigh the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that all rea&s;onings from cau&s;es or effects terminate in conclu&s;ions, concerning matter of fact; that is, concern|ing the exi&s;tence of objects or of their qua|lities. 'Tis al&s;o evident, that the idea o&s; exi&s;tence is nothing different from the idea of any object, and that when after the &s;im|ple conception of any thing we wou'd con|ceive it as exi&s;tent, we in reality make no addition to or alteration on our fir&s;t idea. Thus when we affirm, that God is exi&s;tent, we &s;imply form the idea of &s;uch a being, as he is repre&s;ented to us; nor is the exi&s;tence, which we attribute to him, conceiv'd by a particular idea, which we join to the idea of his other qualities, and can again &s;epa|rate
<PB N="169" REF="180">
and di&s;tingui&s;h from them. But I go farther; and not content with a&s;&s;erting, that the conception of the exi&s;tence of any ob|ject is no addition to the &s;imple conception of it, I likewi&s;e maintain, that the belief of the exi&s;tence joins no new ideas to tho&s;e, which compo&s;e the idea of the object. When I think of God, when I think of him as exi&s;tent, and when I believe him to be exi&s;tent, my idea of him neither en|crea&s;es nor dimini&s;hes. But as 'tis certain there is a great difference betwixt the &s;imple conception of the exi&s;tence of an object, and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the parts or compo&s;ition of the idea, which we conceive; it follows, that it mu&s;t lie in the <HI>manner,</HI> in which we con|ceive it.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a per&s;on pre&s;ent with me, who advances propo&s;itions, to which I do not a&s;&s;ent, <HI>that Cae&s;ar dy'd in his bed, that &s;ilver is more fu&s;ible than lead, or mercury beavier than gold;</HI> 'tis evident, that notwith&s;tand|ing my incredulity, I clearly under&s;tand his meaning, and form all the &s;ame ideas, which he forms. My imagination is endow'd with the &s;ame powers as his; nor is it po&s;|&s;ible for him to conceive any idea, which I cannot conceive; or conjoin any, which I
<PB N="170" REF="181">
cannot conjoin. I therefore a&s;k, Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the difference betwixt believing and di&s;believing any propo&s;ition? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y with regard to propo&s;itions, that are prov'd by intuition or demon&s;tration. In that ca&s;e, the per&s;on, who a&s;&s;ents, not only conceives the ideas according to the propo|&s;ition, but is nece&s;&s;arily determin'd to con|ceive them in that particular manner, either immediately or by the interpo&s;ition of other ideas. Whatever is ab&s;urd is unintelligible; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for the imagination to con|ceive any thing contrary to a demon&s;tration. But as in rea&s;onings from cau&s;ation, and concerning matters of fact, this ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity cannot take place, and the imagina|tion is free to conceive both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, I &s;till a&s;k, <HI>Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the difference betwixt incredulity and belief?</HI> &s;ince in both ca&s;es the conception of the idea is equally po&s;&s;ible and requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>'TWILL not be a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to &s;ay, that a per&s;on, who does not a&s;&s;ent to a propo&s;ition you advance; after having conceiv'd the object in the &s;ame manner with you; immediately conceives it in a different manner, and has different ideas of it. This an&s;wer is un&s;atisfactory; not be|cau&s;e it contains any fal&s;hood, but becau&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="182">
it di&s;covers not all the truth. 'Tis confe&s;t, that in all ca&s;es, wherein we di&s;&s;ent from any per&s;on, we conceive both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; but as we can believe only one, it evidently follows, that the belief mu&s;t make &s;ome difference betwixt that concep|tion to which we a&s;&s;ent, and that from which we di&s;&s;ent. We may mingle, and unite, and &s;eparate, and confound, and vary our ideas in a hundred different ways; but 'till there appears &s;ome principle, which fixes one of the&s;e different &s;ituations, we have in reality no opinion: And this principle, as it plainly makes no addition to our prece|dent ideas, can only change the <HI>manner</HI> of our conceiving them.</P>
<P>ALL the perceptions of the mind are of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, which differ from each other only in their dif|ferent degrees of force and vivacity. Our ideas are copy'd from our impre&s;&s;ions, and repre&s;ent them in all their parts. When you wou'd any way vary the idea of a par|ticular object, you can only encrea&s;e or di|mini&s;h its force and vivacity. If you make any other change on it, it repre&s;ents a dif|ferent object or impre&s;&s;ion. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame as in colours. A particular &s;hade of any colour may acquire a new degree of
<PB N="172" REF="183">
liveline&s;s or brightne&s;s without any other va|riation. But when you produce any other variation, 'tis no longer the &s;ame &s;hade or colour. So that as belief does nothing but vary the manner, in which we conceive any object, it can only be&s;tow on our ideas an additional force and vivacity. An opinion, therefore, or belief may be mo&s;t accurately defin'd, A LIVELY IDEA RELATED TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH A PRESENT IM|PRESSION <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may here take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve a very remark|able error, which being frequently inculcated in the &s;chools, has become a kind of e&s;tabli&s;h'd maxim, and is univer&s;ally received by all logicians. This error con&s;i&s;ts in the vulgar divi&s;ion of the acts of the under&s;tanding, into <HI>conception, judgment</HI> and <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> and in the definitions we give of them. Conception is defin'd to be the &s;imple &s;urvey of one or more ideas: Judgment to be the &s;eparating or uniting of different ideas: Rea&s;oning to be the &s;eparating or uniting of different ideas by the interpo&s;ition of others, which &s;how the relation they bear to each other. But the&s;e di&s;tinctions and definitions are faulty in very con&s;iderable articles. For <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> 'tis far from being true, that in every judgment, which we form, we unite two different ideas; &s;ince in that pro|po&s;ition, <HI>God is,</HI> or indeed any other, which regards ex|i&s;tence, the idea of exi&s;tence is no di&s;tinct idea, which we unite with that of the object, and which is capable of form|ing a compound idea by the union. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As we can thus form a propo&s;ition, which contains only one idea, &s;o we may exert our rea&s;on without employing more than two ideas, and without having recour&s;e to a third to &s;erve as a medium betwixt them. We infer a cau&s;e immediately from its effect; and this inference is not only a true &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, but the &s;tronge&s;t of all others, and more con|vincing than when we interpo&s;e another idea to connect the two extremes. What we may in general affirm concerning the&s;e three acts of the under&s;tanding is, that taking them in a proper light, they all re&s;olve them&s;elves into the fir&s;t, and are nothing but particular ways of conceiving our objects. Whether we con&s;ider a &s;ingle object, or &s;everal; whether we dwell on the&s;e objects, or run from them to others; and in whatever form or order we &s;urvey them, the act of the mind exceeds not a &s;imple conception; and the only re|markable difference, which occurs on this occa&s;ion, is, when we join belief to the conception, and are per&s;waded of the truth of what we conceive. This act of the mind has never yet been explain'd by any philo&s;opher; and therefore I am at liberty to propo&s;e my hypothe&s;is concerning it; which is, that 'tis only a &s;trong and &s;teady conception of any idea, and &s;uch as approaches in &s;ome mea&s;ure to an immediate impre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="184">
HERE are the heads of tho&s;e arguments, which lead us to this conclu&s;ion. When we infer the exi&s;tence of an object from that of others, &s;ome object mu&s;t always be pre&s;ent either to the memory or &s;en&s;es, in order to be the foundation of our rea&s;oning; &s;ince the mind cannot run up with its infe|rences <HI>in infinitum.</HI> Rea&s;on can never &s;a|tisfy us that the exi&s;tence of any one ob|ject does ever imply that of another; &s;o that when we pa&s;s from the impre&s;&s;ion of one to the idea or belief of another, we are not determin'd by rea&s;on, but by cu&s;tom or a principle of a&s;&s;ociation. But belief is &s;ome|what
<PB N="174" REF="185" MS="y">
more than a &s;imple idea. 'Tis a par|ticular manner of forming an idea: And as the &s;ame idea can only be vary'd by a va|riation of its degrees of force and vivacity; it follows upon the whole, that belief is a lively idea produc'd by a relation to a pre|&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, according to the foregoing definition. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>THIS definition will al&s;o be found to be entirely conformable to every one's feeling and experience. Nothing is more evident, than that tho&s;e ideas, to which we a&s;&s;ent, are more &s;trong, firm and vivid, than the loo&s;e reveries of a ca&s;tle-builder. If one per&s;on &s;its down to read a book as a ro|mance, and another as a true hi&s;tory, they plainly receive the &s;ame ideas, and in the &s;ame order; nor does the incredulity of the one, and the belief of the other hinder them from putting the very &s;ame &s;en&s;e upon their author. His words produce the &s;ame ideas in both; tho' his te&s;timony has not the &s;ame influence on them. The latter has a more lively conception of all the incidents. He enters deeper into the concerns of the per|&s;ons: repre&s;ents to him&s;elf their actions, and characters, and friend&s;hips, and enmities: He even goes &s;o far as to form a notion of their features, and air, and per&s;on.

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. <HI>Of the cau&s;es of belief.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus explain'd the nature of belief, and &s;hewn that it con&s;i&s;ts in a lively idea related to a pre&s;ent impre&s;|&s;ion; let us now proceed to examine from what principles it is deriv'd, and what be|&s;tows the vivacity on the idea.</P>
<P>I WOU'D willingly e&s;tabli&s;h it as a ge|neral maxim in the &s;cience of human na|ture, <HI>that when any impre&s;&s;ion becomes pre&s;ent to us, it not only tran&s;ports the mind to &s;uch ideas as are related to it, but likewi&s;e com|municates to them a &s;hare of its force and vivacity.</HI> All the operations of the mind depend in a great mea&s;ure on its di&s;po&s;ition, when it performs them; and according as the &s;pirits are more or le&s;s elevated, and the attention more or le&s;s fix'd, the action will always have more or le&s;s vigour and vi|vacity.
<PB N="176" REF="187">
When therefore any object is pre|&s;ented, which elevates and enlivens the thought, every action, to which the mind applies it&s;elf, will be more &s;trong and vi|vid, as long as that di&s;po&s;ition continues. Now 'tis evident the continuance of the di&s;|po&s;ition depends entirely on the objects, about which the mind is employ'd; and that any new object naturally gives a new direction to the &s;pirits, and changes the di&s;po&s;ition; as on the contrary, when the mind fixes con&s;tant|ly on the &s;ame object, or pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily and in&s;en&s;ibly along related objects, the di&s;po|&s;ition has a much longer duration. Hence it happens, that when the mind is once in|liven'd by a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, it proceeds to form a more lively idea of the related objects, by a natural tran&s;ition of the di&s;|po&s;ition from the one to the other. The change of the objects is &s;o ea&s;y, that the mind is &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of it, but applies it|&s;elf to the conception of the related idea with all the force and vivacity it acquir'd from the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IF in con&s;idering the nature of relation, and that facility of tran&s;ition, which is e&s;&s;en|tial to it, we can &s;atisfy our&s;elves concerning the reality of this phaenomenon, 'tis well: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s I place my chief con|fidence
<PB N="177" REF="188">
in experience to prove &s;o material a principle. We may, therefore, ob&s;erve, as the fir&s;t experiment to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that upon the appearance of the picture of an ab&s;ent friend, our idea of him is evi|dently inliven'd by the <HI>re&s;emblance,</HI> and that every pa&s;&s;ion, which that idea occa&s;ions, whether of joy or &s;orrow, acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect there concur both a relation and a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. Where the picture bears him no re&s;emblance, or at lea&s;t was not intend|ed for him, it never &s;o much as conveys our thought to him: And where it is ab|&s;ent, as well as the per&s;on; tho' the mind may pa&s;s from the thought of the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be ra|ther weaken'd than inliven'd by that tran&s;i|tion. We take a plea&s;ure in viewing the picture of a friend, when 'tis &s;et before us; but when 'tis remov'd, rather choo&s;e to con&s;ider him directly, than by reflexion in an image, which is equally di&s;tant and ob|&s;cure.</P>
<P>THE ceremonies of the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> religion may be con&s;ider'd as experiments of the &s;ame nature. The devotees of that &s;trange &s;uper&s;tition u&s;ually plead in excu&s;e of the mummeries, with which they are
<PB N="178" REF="189">
upbraided, that they feel the good effect of tho&s;e external motions, and po&s;tures, and actions, in inlivening their devotion, and quickening their fervour, which otherwi&s;e wou'd decay away, if directed entirely to di&s;tant and immaterial objects. We &s;hadow out the objects of our faith, &s;ay they, in &s;en&s;ible types and images, and render them more pre&s;ent to us by the immediate pre|&s;ence of the&s;e types, that 'tis po&s;&s;ible for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sen&s;ible objects have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this influence they readily con|vey to tho&s;e ideas, to which they are re|lated, and which they re&s;emble. I &s;hall only infer from the&s;e practices, and this rea&s;oning, that the effect of re&s;emblance in inlivening the idea is very common; and as in every ca&s;e a re&s;emblance and a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t concur, we are abundantly &s;upply'd with experiments to prove the re|ality of the foregoing principle.</P>
<P>WE may add force to the&s;e experiments by others of a different kind, in con&s;idering the effects of <HI>contiguity,</HI> as well as of <HI>re|&s;emblance.</HI> 'Tis certain, that di&s;tance dimi|ni&s;hes the force of every idea, and that upon our approach to any object; tho' it does not
<PB N="179" REF="190" MS="y">
di&s;cover it&s;elf to our &s;en&s;es; it operates upon the mind with an influence that imitates an immediate impre&s;&s;ion. The thinking on any object readily tran&s;ports the mind to what is contiguous; but 'tis only the actual pre&s;ence of an object, that tran&s;ports it with a &s;uperior vivacity. When I am a few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues di&s;tant; tho' even at that di&s;tance the reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends and fa|mily naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter ca&s;e, both the objects of the mind are ideas; notwith&s;tanding there is an ea&s;y tran&s;ition betwixt them; that tran&s;ition alone is not able to give a &s;upe|rior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of &s;ome immediate impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>No one can doubt but cau&s;ation has the &s;ame influence as the other two relations of re&s;emblance and contiguity. Super&s;titious people are fond of the relicts of &s;aints and holy men, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that they &s;eek after types and images, in order to in|liven their devotion, and give them a more intimate and &s;trong conception of tho&s;e ex|emplary lives, which they de&s;ire to imitate. Now 'tis evident, one of the be&s;t relicks a
<PB N="180" REF="191">
devotee cou'd procure, wou'd be the handy|work of a &s;aint; and if his cloaths and fur|niture are ever to be con&s;ider'd in this light, 'tis becau&s;e they were once at his di&s;po&s;al, and were mov'd and affected by him; in which re&s;pect they are to be con&s;ider'd as imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a &s;horter chain of con&s;equences than any of tho&s;e, from which we learn the reality of his exi&s;tence. This phaenomenon clearly proves, that a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion with a relation of cau&s;ation may enliven any idea, and con&s;equently produce belief or a&s;&s;ent, according to the precedent definition of it.</P>
<P>BUT why need we &s;eek for other ar|guments to prove, that a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion with a relation or tran&s;ition of the fancy may inliven any idea, when this very in&s;tance of our rea&s;onings from cau&s;e and effect will alone &s;uffice to that purpo&s;e? 'Tis certain we mu&s;t have an idea of every matter of fact, which we believe. 'Tis certain, that this idea ari&s;es only from a re|lation to a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. 'Tis certain, that the belief &s;uper-adds nothing to the idea, but only changes our manner of con|ceiving it, and renders it more &s;trong and lively. The pre&s;ent conclu&s;ion concerning
<PB N="181" REF="192">
the influence of relation is the immediate con&s;equence of all the&s;e &s;teps; and every &s;tep appears to me &s;ure and infallible. There enters nothing into this operation of the mind but a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, a lively idea, and a relation or a&s;&s;ociation in the fancy betwixt the impre&s;&s;ion and idea; &s;o that there can be no &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IN order to put this whole affair in a fuller light, let us con&s;ider it as a que&s;tion in natural philo&s;ophy, which we mu&s;t de|termine by experience and ob&s;ervation. I &s;uppo&s;e there is an object pre&s;ented, from which I draw a certain conclu&s;ion, and form to my&s;elf ideas, which I am &s;aid to believe or a&s;&s;ent to. Here 'tis evident, that how|ever that object, which is pre&s;ent to my &s;en&s;es, and that other, who&s;e exi&s;tence I infer by rea&s;oning, may be thought to in|fluence each other by their particular powers or qualities; yet as the phaenomenon of belief, which we at pre&s;ent examine, is merely internal, the&s;e powers and qualities, being entirely unknown, can have no hand in producing it. 'Tis the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, which is to be con&s;ider'd as the true and real cau&s;e of the idea, and of the belief which attends it. We mu&s;t therefore en|deavour to di&s;cover by experiments the par|ticular
<PB N="182" REF="193">
qualities, by which 'tis enabled to produce &s;o extraordinary an effect.</P>
<P>FIRST then I ob&s;erve, that the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion has not this effect by its own proper power and efficacy, and when con|&s;ider'd alone, as a &s;ingle perception, limited to the pre&s;ent moment. I find, that an im|pre&s;&s;ion, from which, on its fir&s;t appearance, I can draw no conclu&s;ion, may afterwards become the foundation of belief, when I have had experience of its u&s;ual con&s;equen|ces. We mu&s;t in every ca&s;e have ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion in pa&s;t in&s;tances, and have found it to be con&s;tantly conjoin'd with &s;ome other impre&s;&s;ion. This is con|firm'd by &s;uch a multitude of experiments, that it admits not of the &s;malle&s;t doubt.</P>
<P>FROM a &s;econd ob&s;ervation I conclude, that the belief, which attends the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, and is produc'd by a number of pa&s;t impre&s;&s;ions and conjunctions; that this belief, I &s;ay, ari&s;es immediately, without any new operation of the rea&s;on or imagination. Of this I can be certain, becau&s;e I never am con&s;cious of any &s;uch operation, and find nothing in the &s;ubject, on which it can be founded. Now as we call every thing CUSTOM, which proceeds from a pa&s;t re|petition, without any new rea&s;oning or con|clu&s;ion,
<PB N="183" REF="194">
we may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a certain truth, that all the belief, which follows upon any pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, is deriv'd &s;olely from that origin. When we are accu&s;tom'd to &s;ee two impre&s;&s;ions conjoin'd together, the appearance or idea of the one immediately carries us to the idea of the other.</P>
<P>BEING fully &s;atisfy'd on this head, I make a third &s;et of experiments, in order to know, whether any thing be requi&s;ite, be|&s;ide the cu&s;tomary tran&s;ition, towards the production of this phaenomenon of belief. I therefore change the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion into an idea; and ob&s;erve, that tho' the cu&s;tom|ary tran&s;ition to the correlative idea &s;till re|mains, yet there is in reality no belief nor per&s;wa&s;ion. A pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, then, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to this whole operation; and when after this I compare an impre&s;&s;ion with an idea, and find that their only diffe|rence con&s;i&s;ts in their different degrees of force and vivacity, I conclude upon the whole, that belief is a more vivid and in|ten&s;e conception of an idea, proceeding from its relation to a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THUS all probable rea&s;oning is nothing but a &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ation. 'Tis not &s;olely in poetry and mu&s;ic, we mu&s;t follow our ta&s;te and &s;entiment, but likewi&s;e in philo&s;ophy.
<PB N="184" REF="195">
When I am convinc'd of any principle, 'tis only an idea, which &s;trikes more &s;trongly upon me. When I give the preference to one &s;et of arguments above another, I do nothing but decide from my feeling con|cerning the &s;uperiority of their influence. Objects have no di&s;coverable connexion to|gether; nor is it from any other principle but cu&s;tom operating upon the imagination, that we can draw any inference from the appearance of one to the exi&s;tence of ano|ther.</P>
<P>'TWILL here be worth our ob&s;ervation, that the pa&s;t experience, on which all our judgments concerning cau&s;e and effect de|pend, may operate on our mind in &s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible manner as never to be taken no|tice of, and may even in &s;ome mea&s;ure be un|known to us. A per&s;on, who &s;tops &s;hort in his journey upon meeting a river in his way, fore&s;ees the con&s;equences of his pro|ceeding forward; and his knowledge of the&s;e con&s;equences is convey'd to him by pa&s;t experience, which informs him of &s;uch cer|tain conjunctions of cau&s;es and effects. But can we think, that on this occa&s;ion he re|flects on any pa&s;t experience, and calls to remembrance in&s;tances, that he has &s;een or heard of, in order to di&s;cover the effects of
<PB N="185" REF="196">
water on animal bodies? No &s;urely; this is not the method, in which he proceeds in his rea&s;oning. The idea of &s;inking is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with that of water, and the idea of &s;uffocating with that of &s;inking, that the mind makes the tran&s;ition without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the memory. The cu&s;tom operates before we have time for reflection. The objects &s;eem &s;o in&s;eparable, that we in|terpo&s;e not a moment's delay in pa&s;&s;ing from the one to the other. But as this tran&s;ition proceeds from experience, and not from any primary connexion betwixt the ideas, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily acknowledge, that experience may produce a belief and a judgment of cau&s;es and effects by a &s;ecret operation, and with|out being once thought of. This removes all pretext, if there yet remains any, for a&s;&s;erting that the mind is convinc'd by rea|&s;oning of that principle, <HI>that in&s;tances of which we have no experience, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily re&s;emble tho&s;e, of which we have.</HI> For we here find, that the under&s;tanding or imagination can draw inferences from pa&s;t experience, without reflecting on it; much more without forming any principle con|cerning it, or rea&s;oning upon that prin|ciple.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="197">
IN general we may ob&s;erve, that in all the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd and uniform conjunc|tions of cau&s;es and effects, &s;uch as tho&s;e of gravity, impul&s;e, &s;olidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the mind never carries its view expre&s;&s;ly to con&s;ider any pa&s;t experience: Tho' in other a&s;&s;oci|ations of objects, which are more rare and unu&s;ual, it may a&s;&s;i&s;t the cu&s;tom and tran|&s;ition of ideas by this reflection. Nay we find in &s;ome ca&s;es, that the reflection pro|duces the belief without the cu&s;tom; or more properly &s;peaking, that the reflection produces the cu&s;tom in an <HI>oblique</HI> and <HI>ar|tificial</HI> manner. I explain my&s;elf. 'Tis certain, that not only in philo&s;ophy, but even in common life, we may attain the knowledge of a particular cau&s;e merely by one experiment, provided it be made with judgment, and after a careful removal of all foreign and &s;uperfluous circum&s;tances. Now as after one experiment of this kind, the mind, upon the appearance either of the cau&s;e or the effect, can draw an inference concerning the exi&s;tence of its correlative; and as a habit can never be acquir'd merely by one in&s;tance; it may be thought, that belief cannot in this ca&s;e be e&s;teem'd the effect of cu&s;tom. But this difficulty will vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider, that tho' we are
<PB N="187" REF="198">
here &s;uppos'd to have had only one expe|riment of a particular effect, yet we have many millions to convince us of this principle; <HI>that like objects, plac'd in like circum&s;tances, will always produce like ef|fects;</HI> and as this principle has e&s;tabli&s;h'd it&s;elf by a &s;ufficient cu&s;tom, it be&s;tows an evidence and firmne&s;s on any opinion, to which it can be apply'd. The connexion of the ideas is not habitual after one ex|periment; but this connexion is compre|hended under another principle, that is ha|bitual; which brings us back to our hypo|the&s;is. In all ca&s;es we transfer our experi|ence to in&s;tances, of which we have no experience, either <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> or <HI>tacitly,</HI> either <HI>directly</HI> or <HI>indirectly.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not conclude this &s;ubject with|out ob&s;erving, that 'tis very difficult to talk of the operations of the mind with perfect propriety and exactne&s;s; becau&s;e common language has &s;eldom made any very nice di&s;tinctions among them, but has generally call'd by the &s;ame term all &s;uch as nearly re&s;emble each other. And as this is a &s;ource almo&s;t inevitable of ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion in the author; &s;o it may frequently give ri&s;e to doubts and objections in the reader, which otherwi&s;e he wou'd never have dream'd
<PB N="188" REF="199">
of. Thus my general po&s;ition, that an opi|nion or belief is <HI>nothing but a &s;trong and lively idea deriv'd from a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion re|lated to it,</HI> may be liable to the following ob|jection, by rea&s;on of a little ambiguity in tho&s;e words <HI>&s;trong and lively.</HI> It may be &s;aid, that not only an impre&s;&s;ion may give ri&s;e to rea&s;oning, but that an idea may al&s;o have the &s;ame influence; e&s;pecially upon my prin|ciple, <HI>that all our ideas are deriv'd from corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ions.</HI> For &s;uppo&s;e I form at pre&s;ent an idea, of which I have forgot the corre&s;pondent impre&s;&s;ion, I am able to conclude from this idea, that &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion did once exi&s;t; and as this conclu&s;ion is attended with belief, it may be a&s;k'd, from whence are the qua|lities of force and vivacity deriv'd, which con&s;titute this belief? And to this I an&s;wer very readily, <HI>from the pre&s;ent idea.</HI> For as this idea is not here con&s;ider'd, as the re|pre&s;entation of any ab&s;ent object, but as a real perception in the mind, of which we are intimately con&s;cious, it mu&s;t be able to be&s;tow on whatever is related to it the &s;ame quality, call it <HI>firmne&s;s, or &s;olidity, or force, or vivacity,</HI> with which the mind reflects upon it, and is a&s;&s;ur'd of its pre&s;ent exi&s;|tence. The idea here &s;upplies the place of
<PB N="189" REF="200">
an impre&s;&s;ion, and is entirely the &s;ame, &s;o far as regards our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ame principles we need not be &s;urpriz'd to hear of the remembrance of an idea; that is, of the idea of an idea, and of its force and vivacity &s;uperior to the loo&s;e conceptions of the imagination. In thinking of our pa&s;t thoughts we not only delineate out the objects, of which we were thinking, but al&s;o conceive the action of the mind in the meditation, that certain <HI>je-ne-&s;cai-quoi,</HI> of which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any definition or de&s;cription, but which e|very one &s;ufficiently under&s;tands. When the memory offers an idea of this, and re|pre&s;ents it as pa&s;t, 'tis ea&s;ily conceiv'd how that idea may have more vigour and firm|ne&s;s, than when we think of a pa&s;t thought, of which we have no remembrance.</P>
<P>AFTER this any one will under&s;tand how we may form the idea of an im|pre&s;&s;ion and of an idea, and how we may believe the exi&s;tence of an impre&s;&s;ion and of an idea.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. <HI>Of the effects of other relations and other habits.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER convincing the forego|ing arguments may appear, we mu&s;t not re&s;t contented with them, but mu&s;t turn the &s;ubject on every &s;ide, in order to find &s;ome new points of view, from which we may illu&s;trate and confirm &s;uch extraordi|nary, and &s;uch fundamental principles. A &s;crupulous he&s;itation to receive any new hypothe&s;is is &s;o laudable a di&s;po&s;ition in philo&s;ophers, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the exami|nation of truth, that it de&s;erves to be com|ply'd with, and requires that every argu|ment be produc'd, which may tend to their &s;atisfaction, and every objection remov'd, which may &s;top them in their rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I HAVE often ob&s;erv'd, that, be&s;ide cau&s;e and effect, the two relations of re|&s;emblance and contiguity, are to be con&s;i|der'd as a&s;&s;ociating principles of thought, and as capable of conveying the imagina|tion from one idea to another. I have al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that when of two objects connec|ted
<PB N="191" REF="202">
together by any of the&s;e relations, one is immediately pre&s;ent to the memory or &s;en&s;es, not only the mind is convey'd to its co-relative by means of the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple; but likewi&s;e conceives it with an ad|ditional force and vigour, by the united o|peration of that principle, and of the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. All this I have ob&s;erv'd, in order to confirm by analogy, my explication of our judgments concerning cau&s;e and effect. But this very argument may, perhaps, be turn'd again&s;t me, and in&s;tead of a confir|mation of my hypothe&s;is, may become an objection to it. For it may be &s;aid, that if all the parts of that hypothe&s;is be true, <HI>viz. that</HI> the&s;e three &s;pecies of relation are deriv'd from the &s;ame principles; <HI>that</HI> their effects in inforcing and inlivening our ideas are the &s;ame; and <HI>that</HI> belief is no|thing but a more forcible and vivid concep|tion of an idea; it &s;hou'd follow, that that action of the mind may not only be deriv'd from the relation of cau&s;e and effect, but al&s;o from tho&s;e of contiguity and re&s;em|blance. But as we find by experience, that belief ari&s;es only from cau&s;ation, and that we can draw no inference from one object to another, except they be connected by this relation, we may conclude, that
<PB N="192" REF="203">
there is &s;ome error in that rea&s;oning, which leads us into &s;uch difficulties.</P>
<P>THIS is the objection; let us now con|&s;ider its &s;olution. 'Tis evident, that what|ever is pre&s;ent to the memory, &s;triking up|on the mind with a vivacity, which re|&s;embles an immediate impre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be|come of con&s;iderable moment in all the o|perations of the mind, and mu&s;t ea&s;ily di|&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf above the mere fictions of the imagination. Of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions or ideas of the memory we form a kind of &s;y&s;tem, comprehending whatever we remember to have been pre&s;ent, either to our internal perception or &s;en&s;es; and every particular of that &s;y&s;tem, join'd to the pre&s;ent im|pre&s;&s;ions, we are pleas'd to call a <HI>reality.</HI> But the mind &s;tops not here. For finding, that with this &s;y&s;tem of perceptions, there is another connected by cu&s;tom, or if you will, by the relation of cau&s;e or effect, it proceeds to the con&s;ideration of their ideas; and as it feels that 'tis in a manner nece&s;&s;a|rily determin'd to view the&s;e particular ideas, and that the cu&s;tom or relation, by which it is determin'd, admits not of the lea&s;t change, it forms them into a new &s;y&s;tem, which it likewi&s;e dignifies with the title of <HI>realities.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems is the
<PB N="193" REF="204">
object of the memory and &s;en&s;es; the &s;e|cond of the judgment.</P>
<P>'TIS this latter principle, which peoples the world, and brings us acquainted with &s;uch exi&s;tences, as by their removal in time and place, lie beyond the reach of the &s;en&s;es and memory. By means of it I paint the univer&s;e in my imagination, and fix my at|tention on any part of it I plea&s;e. I form an idea of ROME, which I neither &s;ee nor remember; but which is connected with &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as I remember to have re|ceived from the conver&s;ation and books of travellers and hi&s;torians. This idea of <HI>Rome</HI> I place in a certain &s;ituation on the idea of an object, which I call the globe. I join to it the conception of a particular govern|ment, and religion, and manners. I look backward and con&s;ider its fir&s;t foundation; its &s;everal revolutions, &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and misfor|tunes. All this, and every thing el&s;e, which I believe, are nothing but ideas; tho' by their force and &s;ettled order, ari&s;ing from cu&s;tom and the relation of cau&s;e and effect, they di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the other ideas, which are merely the offspring of the imagination.</P>
<P>AS to the influence of contiguity and re&s;emblance, we may ob&s;erve, that if the
<PB N="194" REF="205">
contiguous and re&s;embling object be com|prehended in this &s;y&s;tem of realities, there is no doubt but the&s;e two relations will a&s;&s;i&s;t that of cau&s;e and effect, and in|fix the related idea with more force in the imagination. This I &s;hall enlarge upon pre&s;ently. Mean while I &s;hall carry my ob|&s;ervation a &s;tep farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that even where the related object is but feign'd, the relation will &s;erve to enliven the idea, and encrea&s;e its influence. A poet, no doubt, will be the better able to form a &s;trong de|&s;cription of the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> fields, that he prompts his imagination by the view of a beautiful meadow or garden; as at another time he may by his fancy place him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the&s;e fabulous regions, that by the feign'd contiguity he may enliven his imagination.</P>
<P>BUT tho' I cannot altogether exclude the relations of re&s;emblance and contiguity from operating on the fancy in this manner, 'tis ob&s;ervable that, when &s;ingle, their in|fluence is very feeble and uncertain. As the relation of cau&s;e and effect is requi&s;ite to per&s;uade us of any real exi&s;tence, &s;o is this per&s;ua&s;ion requi&s;ite to give force to the&s;e o|ther relations. For where upon the appear|ance of an impre&s;&s;ion we not only feign
<PB N="195" REF="206">
another object, but likewi&s;e arbitrarily, and of our mere good-will and plea&s;ure give it a particular relation to the impre&s;&s;ion, this can have but a &s;mall effect upon the mind; nor is there any rea&s;on, why, upon the re|turn of the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion, we &s;hou'd be determin'd to place the &s;ame object in the &s;ame relation to it. There is no manner of nece&s;&s;ity for the mind to feign any re&s;em|bling and contiguous objects; and if it feigns &s;uch, there is as little nece&s;&s;ity for it always to confine it&s;elf to the &s;ame, without any difference or variation. And indeed &s;uch a fiction is founded on &s;o little rea&s;on, that nothing but pure <HI>caprice</HI> can determine the mind to form it; and that principle be|ing fluctuating and uncertain, 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble it can ever operate with any con&s;idera|ble degree of force and con&s;tancy. The mind for&s;ees and anticipates the change; and even from the very fir&s;t in&s;tant feels the loo&s;ene&s;s of its actions, and the weak hold it has of its objects. And as this imperfec|tion is very &s;en&s;ible in every &s;ingle in&s;tance, it &s;till encrea&s;es by experience and ob|&s;ervation, when we compare the &s;everal in|&s;tances we may remember, and form a <HI>ge|neral rule</HI> again&s;t the repo&s;ing any a&s;&s;urance in tho&s;e momentary glimp&s;es of light, which
<PB N="196" REF="207">
ari&s;e in the imagination from a feign'd re|&s;emblance and contiguity.</P>
<P>THE relation of cau&s;e and effect has all the oppo&s;ite advantages. The objects it pre|&s;ents are fixt and unalterable. The impre&s;|&s;ions of the memory never change in any con&s;iderable degree; and each impre&s;&s;ion draws along with it a preci&s;e idea, which takes its place in the imagination, as &s;ome|thing &s;olid and real, certain and invariable. The thought is always determin'd to pa&s;s from the impre&s;&s;ion to the idea, and from that particular impre&s;&s;ion to that particu|lar idea, without any choice or he&s;itation.</P>
<P>BUT not content with removing this ob|jection, I &s;hall endeavour to extract from it a proof of the pre&s;ent doctrine. Contigui|ty and re&s;emblance have an effect much in|ferior to cau&s;ation; but &s;till have &s;ome ef|fect, and augment the conviction of any opinion, and the vivacity of any conception. If this can be prov'd in &s;everal new in&s;tances, be&s;ide what we have already ob&s;erv'd, 'twill be allow'd no incon&s;iderable argument, that belief is nothing but a lively idea related to a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To begin with contiguity; it has been remark'd among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> as well as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that tho&s;e <HI>pilgrims,</HI> who have
<PB N="197" REF="208">
&s;een MECCA or the HOLY LAND are ever after more faithful and zealous believers, than tho&s;e who have not had that advantage. A man, who&s;e memory pre&s;ents him with a lively image of the <HI>Red-Sea, and the De|&s;ert, and Jeru&s;alem, and Galiee,</HI> can never doubt of any miraculous events, which are related either by <HI>Mo&s;es or the Evangeli&s;ts.</HI> The lively idea of the places pa&s;&s;es by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to the facts, which are &s;up|pos'd to have been related to them by con|tiguity, and encrea&s;es the belief by encrea|&s;ing the vivacity of the conception. The remembrance of the&s;e fields and rivers has the &s;ame influence on the vulgar as a new argument; and from the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>WE may from a like ob&s;ervation con|cerning <HI>re&s;emblance.</HI> We have remark'd, that the conclu&s;ion, which we draw from a pre&s;ent object to its ab&s;ent cau&s;e or effect, is never founded on any qualities, which we ob&s;erve in that object, con&s;ider'd in it|&s;elf; or, in other words, that 'its impo&s;&s;ible to determine, otherwi&s;e than by experience, what will re&s;ult from any phaenomenon, or what has preceded it. But tho' this be &s;o evident in it&s;elf, that it &s;eem'd not to require any proof; yet &s;ome philo&s;o|phers have imagin'd that there is an appa|rent
<PB N="198" REF="209">
cau&s;e for the communication of mo|tion, and that a rea&s;onable man might im|mediately infer the motion of one body from the impul&s;e of another, without having re|cour&s;e to any pa&s;t ob&s;ervation. That this opinion is fal&s;e will admit of an ea&s;y proof. For if &s;uch an inference may be drawn mere|ly from the ideas of body, of motion, and of impul&s;e, it mu&s;t amount to a demon|&s;tration, and mu&s;t imply the ab&s;olute im|po&s;&s;ibility of any contrary &s;uppo&s;ition. Eve|ry effect, then, be&s;ide the communication of motion, implies a formal contradiction; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible not only that it can exi&s;t, but al&s;o that it can be conceiv'd. But we may &s;oon &s;atisfy our&s;elves of the contrary, by forming a clear and con&s;i&s;tent idea of one body's moving upon another, and of its re&s;t immediately upon the contact; or of its re|turning back in the &s;ame line, in which it came; or of its annihilation; or circular or elliptical motion: and in &s;hort, of an infinite number of other changes, which we may &s;uppo&s;e it to undergo. The&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions are all con&s;i&s;tent and natural; and the rea|&s;on, why we imagine the communication of motion to be more con&s;i&s;tent and natural not only than tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, but al&s;o than any other natural effect, is founded on
<PB N="199" REF="210">
the relation of <HI>re&s;emblance</HI> betwixt the cau&s;e and effect, which is here united to experi|ence, and binds the objects in the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t intimate manner to each other, &s;o as to make us imagine them to be ab&s;olute|ly in&s;eparable. Re&s;emblance, then, has the &s;ame or a parallel influence with experience; and as the only immediate effect of expe|rience is to a&s;&s;ociate our ideas together, it follows, that all belief ari&s;es from the a&s;&s;o|ciation of ideas, according to my hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>'TIS univer&s;ally allow'd by the writers on optics, that the eye at all times &s;ees an equal number of phy&s;ical points, and that a man on the top of a mountain has no larger an image pre&s;ented to his &s;en&s;es, than when he is coop'd up in the narrowe&s;t court or cham|ber. 'Tis only by experience that he infers the greatne&s;s of the object from &s;ome pecu|liar qualities of the image; and this infe|rence of the judgment he confounds with &s;en&s;ation, as is common on other occa&s;ions. Now 'tis evident, that the inference of the judgment is here much more lively than what is u&s;ual in our common rea&s;onings, and that a man has a more vivid conception of the va&s;t extent of the ocean from the image he receives by the eye, when he &s;tands on the top of the high promontory, than mere|ly
<PB N="200" REF="211">
from hearing the roaring of the waters. He feels a more &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure from its magnificence; which is a proof of a more lively idea: And he confounds his judg|ment with &s;en&s;ation; which is another proof of it. But as the inference is equally cer|tain and immediate in both ca&s;es, this &s;upe|rior vivacity of our conception in one ca&s;e can proceed from nothing but this, that in drawing an inference from the fight, be|&s;ide the cu&s;tomary conjunction, there is al|&s;o a re&s;emblance betwixt the image and the object we infer; which &s;trengthens the re|lation, and conveys the vivacity of the im|pre&s;&s;ion to the related idea with an ea&s;ier and more natural movement.</P>
<P>No weakne&s;s of human nature is more univer&s;al and con&s;picuous than what we com|monly call CREDULITY, or a too ea&s;y faith in the te&s;timony of others; and this weakne&s;s is al&s;o very naturally accounted for from the influence of re&s;emblance. When we receive any matter of fact upon human te&s;timony, our faith ari&s;es from the very &s;ame origin as our inferences from cau&s;es to effects, and from effects to cau&s;es; nor is there any thing but our <HI>experience</HI> of the governing principles of human nature, which can give us any a&s;&s;urance of the veracity of
<PB N="201" REF="212">
men. But tho' experience be the true &s;tan|dard of this, as well as of all other judg|ments, we &s;eldom regulate our&s;elves entire|ly by it; but have a remarkable propen&s;ity to believe whatever is reported, even con|cerning apparitions, enchantments, and pro|digies, however contrary to daily experience and ob&s;ervation. The words or di&s;cour&s;es of others have an intimate connexion with certain ideas in their mind; and the&s;e ideas have al&s;o a connexion with the facts or ob|jects, which they repre&s;ent. This latter connexion is generally much over-rated, and commands our a&s;&s;ent beyond what experi|ence will ju&s;tify; which can proceed from nothing be&s;ide the re&s;emblance betwixt the ideas and the facts. Other effects only point out their cau&s;es in an oblique manner; but the te&s;timony of men does it directly, and is to be con&s;ider'd as an image as well as an effect. No wonder, therefore, we are &s;o ra&s;h in drawing our inferences from it, and are le&s;s guided by experience in our judgments concerning it, that in tho&s;e up|on any other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As re&s;emblance, when conjoin'd with cau&s;ation, fortifies our rea&s;onings; &s;o the want of it in any very great degree is able almo&s;t entirely to de&s;troy them. Of
<PB N="202" REF="213">
this there is a remarkable in&s;tance in the univer&s;al carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;tupidity of men with regard to a future &s;tate, where they &s;how as ob&s;tinate an incredulity, as they do a blind credulity on other occa&s;ions. There is not indeed a more ample matter of wonder to the &s;tudious, and of regret to the pious man, than to ob&s;erve the neg|ligence of the bulk of mankind concern|ing their approaching condition; and 'tis with rea&s;on, that many eminent theologians have not &s;crupled to affirm, that tho' the vulgar have no formal principles of infide|lity, yet they are really infidels in their hearts, and have nothing like what we can call a belief of the eternal duration of their &s;ouls. For let us con&s;ider on the one hand what divines have di&s;play'd with &s;uch elo|quence concerning the importance of eter|nity; and at the &s;ame time reflect, that tho' in matters of rhetoric we ought to lay our account with &s;ome exaggeration, we mu&s;t in this ca&s;e allow, that the &s;tronge&s;t figures are infinitely inferior to the &s;ubject: And after this let us view on the other hand the prodigious &s;ecurity of men in this par|ticular: I a&s;k, if the&s;e people really believe what is inculcated on them, and what they pretend to affirm; and the an&s;wer is obvi|ou&s;ly
<PB N="203" REF="214">
in the negative. As belief is an act of the mind ari&s;ing from cu&s;tom, 'tis not &s;trange the want of re&s;emblance &s;hou'd over|throw what cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and di|mini&s;h the force of the idea, as much as that latter principle encrea&s;es it. A future &s;tate is &s;o far remov'd from our comprehen&s;ion, and we have &s;o ob&s;cure an idea of the man|ner, in which we &s;hall exi&s;t after the di&s;|&s;olution of the body, that all the rea&s;ons we can invent, however &s;trong in them|&s;elves, and however much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by edu|cation, are never able with &s;low imaginations to &s;urmount this difficulty, or be&s;tow a &s;uf|ficient authority and force on the idea. I rather choo&s;e to a&s;cribe this incredulity to the faint idea we form of our future condi|tion, deriv'd from its want of re&s;emblance to the pre&s;ent life, than to that deriv'd from its remotene&s;s. For I ob&s;erve, that men are every where concern'd about what may happen after their death, provided it regard this world; and that there are few to whom their name, their family, their friends, and their country are in any period of time en|tirely indifferent.</P>
<P>AND indeed the want of re&s;emblance in this ca&s;e &s;o entirely de&s;troys belief, that ex|cept tho&s;e few, who upon cool reflection on
<PB N="204" REF="215">
the importance of the &s;ubject, have taken care by repeated meditation to imprint in their minds the arguments for a future &s;tate, there &s;carce are any, who believe the im|mortality of the &s;oul with a true and e&s;tab|li&s;h'd judgment; &s;uch as is deriv'd from the te&s;timony of travellers and hi&s;torians. This appears very con&s;picuou&s;ly wherever men have occa&s;ion to compare the plea&s;ures and pains, the rewards and puni&s;hments of this life with tho&s;e of a future; even tho' the ca&s;e does not concern them&s;elves, and there is no violent pa&s;&s;ion to di&s;turb their judg|ment. The <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> are certainly the mo&s;t zealous of any &s;ect in the chri&s;tian world; and yet you'll find few among the more &s;en&s;ible people of that communion, who do not blame the <HI>Gunpowder-trea&s;on,</HI> and the ma&s;&s;acre of St. <HI>Bartholemew,</HI> as cruel and barbarous, tho' projected or executed again&s;t tho&s;e very people, whom without any &s;cruple they condemn to eternal and infinite puni&s;hments. All we can &s;ay in ex|cu&s;e for this incon&s;i&s;tency is, that they really do not believe what they affirm concerning a future &s;tate; nor is there any better proof of it than the very incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>WE may add to this a remark; that in matters of religion men take a plea&s;ure in
<PB N="205" REF="216">
being terrify'd, and that no preachers are &s;o popular, as tho&s;e who excite the mo&s;t di&s;|mal and gloomy pa&s;&s;ions. In the common affairs of life, where we feel and are pene|trated with the &s;olidity of the &s;ubject, no|thing can be more di&s;agreeable than fear and terror; and 'tis only in dramatic perfor|mances and in religious di&s;cour&s;es, that they ever give plea&s;ure. In the&s;e latter ca&s;es the imagination repo&s;es it&s;elf indolently on the idea; and the pa&s;&s;ion, being &s;often'd by the want of belief in the &s;ubject, has no more than the agreeable effect of enlivening the mind, and fixing the attention.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is will receive additi|onal confirmation, if we examine the effects of other kinds of cu&s;tom, as well as of other relations. To under&s;tand this we mu&s;t con|&s;ider, that cu&s;tom, to which I attribute all belief and rea&s;oning, may operate upon the mind in invigorating an idea after two &s;e|veral ways. For &s;uppo&s;ing that in all pa&s;t experience we have found two objects to have been always conjoin'd together, 'tis evident, that upon the appearance of one of the&s;e objects in an impre&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t from cu&s;|tom make an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to the idea of that object, which u&s;ually attends it; and by means of the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion and ea&s;y
<PB N="206" REF="217">
tran&s;ition mu&s;t conceive that idea in a &s;tronger and more lively manner, than we do any loo&s;e floating image of the fancy. But let us next &s;uppo&s;e, that a mere idea alone, without any of this curious and almo&s;t ar|tificial preparation, &s;hou'd frequently make its appearance in the mind, this idea mu&s;t by degrees acquire a facility and force; and both by its firm hold and ea&s;y introduction di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf from any new and unu&s;ual idea. This is the only particular, in which the&s;e two kinds of cu&s;tom agree; and if it appear, that their effects on the judgment are &s;imilar and proportionable, we may cer|tainly conclude, that the foregoing explica|tion of that faculty is &s;atisfactory. But can we doubt of this agreement in their influence on the judgment, when we con&s;ider the na|ture and effects of EDUCATION?</P>
<P>ALL tho&s;e opinions and notions of things, to which we have been accu&s;tom'd from our infancy, take &s;uch deep root, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us, by all the powers of rea|&s;on and experience, to eradicate them; and this habit not only approaches in its influ|ence, but even on many occa&s;ions prevails over that which ari&s;es from the con&s;tant and in&s;eparable union of cau&s;es and effects. Here we mu&s;t not be contented with &s;aying, that
<PB N="207" REF="218">
the vividne&s;s of the idea produces the belief: We mu&s;t maintain that they are individu|ally the &s;ame. The frequent repetition of any idea infixes it in the imagination; but cou'd never po&s;&s;ibly of it&s;elf produce belief, if that act of the mind was, by the original con&s;titution of our natures, annex'd only to a rea&s;oning and compari&s;on of ideas. Cu&s;|tom may lead us into &s;ome fal&s;e compa|ri&s;on of ideas. This is the utmo&s;t effect we can conceive of it. But 'tis certain it cou'd never &s;upply the place of that compari&s;on, nor produce any act of the mind, which naturally belong'd to that principle.</P>
<P>A PERSON, that has lo&s;t a leg or an arm by amputation, endeavours for a long time afterwards to &s;erve him&s;elf with them. After the death of any one, 'tis a common remark of the whole family, but e&s;pecially of the &s;ervants, that they can &s;carce believe him to be dead, but &s;till imagine him to be in his chamber or in any other place, where they were accu&s;tom'd to find him. I have often heard in conver&s;ation, after talking of a per&s;on, that is any way cele|brated, that one, who has no acquaintance with him, will &s;ay, <HI>I have never &s;een &s;uch-a|one, but almo&s;t fancy I have; &s;o often have I</HI>

<HI>heard talk of him.</HI> All the&s;e are parallel in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider this argument from <HI>edu|cation</HI> in a proper light, 'twill appear very con|vincing; and the more &s;o, that 'tis founded on one of the mo&s;t common phaenomena, that is any where to be met with. I am per&s;uaded, that upon examination we &s;hall find more than one half of tho&s;e opinions, that prevail among mankind, to be owing to education, and that the principles, which are thus implicitely embrac'd, over-ballance tho&s;e, which are owing either to ab&s;tract rea&s;oning or experience. As liars, by the frequent repetition of their lies, come at la&s;t to remember them; &s;o the judgment, or rather the imagination, by the like means, may have ideas &s;o &s;trongly imprinted on it, and conceive them in &s;o full a light, that they may operate upon the mind in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e, which the &s;en&s;es, memory or rea&s;on pre&s;ent to us. But as education is an artificial and not a natural cau&s;e, and as its maxims are frequently con|trary to rea&s;on, and even to them&s;elves in different times and places, it is never upon that account recogniz'd by philo&s;ophers; tho' in reality it be built almo&s;t on the &s;ame foundation of cu&s;tom and repetition

as our rea&s;onings from cau&s;es and effects.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN general we may ob&s;erve, that as our a&s;&s;ent to all probable rea&s;onings is founded on the vivacity of ideas, it re|&s;embles many of tho&s;e whim&s;ies and prejudices, which are re|jected under the opprobrious character of being the offspring of the imagination. By this expre&s;&s;ion it appears that the word, imagination, is commonly us'd in two different &s;en&s;es; and tho' nothing be more contrary to true philo&s;ophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in the following rea&s;onings I have often been oblig'd to fall into it. When I oppo&s;e the imagination to the memory, I mean the faculty, by which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppo&s;e it to rea&s;on, I mean the &s;ame faculty, excluding only our demon&s;trative and probable rea|&s;onings. When I oppo&s;e it to neither, 'tis indifferent whether it be taken in the larger or more limited &s;en&s;e, or at lea&s;t the context will &s;ufficiently explain the meaning.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>BUT tho' education be di&s;claim'd by philo&s;ophy, as a fallacious ground of a&s;&s;ent to any opinion, it prevails neverthele&s;s in the world, and is the cau&s;e why all &s;y&s;|tems are apt to be rejected at fir&s;t as new and unu&s;ual. This perhaps will be the fate of what I have here advanc'd concerning <HI>belief,</HI> and tho' the proofs I have produc'd appear to me perfectly conclu&s;ive, I expect not to make many pro&s;elytes to my opi|nion. Men will &s;carce ever be per&s;uaded, that effects of &s;uch con&s;equence can flow from principles, which are &s;eemingly &s;o incon&s;i|derable, and that the far greate&s;t part of our rea&s;onings with all our actions and pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="210" REF="221">
can be deriv'd from nothing but cu&s;tom and habit. To obviate this objection, I &s;hall here anticipate a little what wou'd more properly fall under our con&s;ideration afterwards, when we come to treat of the pa&s;&s;ions and the &s;en&s;e of beauty.</P>
<P>THERE is implanted in the human mind a perception of pain and plea&s;ure, as the chief &s;pring and moving principle of all its actions. But pain and plea&s;ure have two ways of mak|ing their appearance in the mind; of which the one has effects very different from the other. They may either appear in impre&s;&s;ion to the actual feeling, or only in idea, as at pre&s;ent when I mention them. 'Tis evident the influ|ence of the&s;e upon actions is far from being equal. Impre&s;&s;ions always actuate the &s;oul, and that in the highe&s;t degree; but 'tis not every idea which has the &s;ame effect. Na|ture has proceeded with caution in this ca&s;e, and &s;eems to have carefully avoided the in|conveniences of two extremes. Did impre&s;|&s;ions alone influence the will, we &s;hould every moment of our lives be &s;ubject to the greate&s;t calamities; becau&s;e, tho' we fore&s;aw their approach, we &s;hould not be provided by nature with any principle of action, which might impel us to avoid them. On the other hand, did every idea influence our actions,
<PB N="211" REF="222">
our condition would not be much mended. For &s;uch is the un&s;teadine&s;s and activity of thought, that the images of every thing, e&s;pecially of goods and evils, are always wandering in the mind; and were it mov'd by every idle conception of this kind, it would never enjoy a moment's peace and tranquillity.</P>
<P>NATURE has, therefore, cho&s;en a me|dium, and has neither be&s;tow'd on every idea of good and evil the power of actuating the will, nor yet has entirely excluded them from this influence. Tho' an idle fiction has no efficacy, yet we find by experience, that the ideas of tho&s;e objects, which we believe either are or will be exi&s;tent, produce in a le&s;&s;er degree the &s;ame effect with tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions, which are immediately pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es and perception. The effect, then, of belief is to rai&s;e up a &s;imple idea to an equality with our impre&s;&s;ions, and be&s;tow on it a like influence on the pa&s;&s;ions. This effect it can only have by making an idea approach an impre&s;ion in force and vivacity. For as the different degrees of force make all the original difference betwixt an impre&s;&s;ion and an idea, they mu&s;t of con&s;equence be the &s;ource of all the differences in the effects of the&s;e perceptions, and their removal, in whole
<PB N="212" REF="223">
or in part, the cau&s;e of every new re&s;emblance they acquire. Wherever we can make an idea approach the impre&s;&s;ions in force and vivacity, it will likewi&s;e imitate them in its influence on the mind; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> where it imi|tates them in that influence, as in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, this mu&s;t proceed from its ap|proaching them in force and vivacity. Be|lief, therefore, &s;ince it cau&s;es an idea to imi|tate the effects of the impre&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t make it re&s;emble them in the&s;e qualities, and is nothing but <HI>a more vivid and inten&s;e concep|tion of any idea.</HI> This, then, may both &s;erve as an additional argument for the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;|tem, and may give us a notion after what manner our rea&s;onings from cau&s;ation are able to operate on the will and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>As belief is almo&s;t ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to the exciting our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o the pa&s;&s;ions in their turn are very favourable to belief; and not only &s;uch facts as convey agreeable emo|tions, but very often &s;uch as give pain, do upon that account become more readily the objects of faith and opinion. A coward, who&s;e fears are ea&s;ily awaken'd, readily a&s;|&s;ents to every account of danger he meets with; as a per&s;on of a &s;orrowful and melan|choly di&s;po&s;ition is very credulous of every thing, that nouri&s;hes his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="213" REF="224">
When any affecting object is pre&s;ented, it gives the alarm, and excites immediately degree of its proper pa&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially in per&s;ons who are naturally inclined to that pa&s;&s;ion. This emotion pa&s;&s;es by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to the imagination; and diffu&s;ing it&s;elf over our idea of the affecting object, makes us form that idea with greater force and vivacity, and con&s;equently a&s;&s;ent to it, according to the precedent &s;y&s;tem. Admi|ration and &s;urprize have the &s;ame effect as the other pa&s;&s;ions; and accordingly we may ob&s;erve, that among the vulgar, quacks and projectors meet with a more ea&s;y faith upon account of their magnificent preten&s;ions, than if they kept them&s;elves within the bounds of moderation. The fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, which naturally attends their miraculous relations, &s;preads it&s;elf over the whole &s;oul, and &s;o vi|vifies and enlivens the idea, that it re&s;embles the inferences we draw from experience. This is a my&s;tery, with which we may be alrea|dy a little acquainted, and which we &s;hall have farther occa&s;ion to be let into in the progre&s;s of this treati&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER this account of the influence of belief on the pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hall find le&s;s difficulty in explaining its effects on the imagination, however extraordinary they
<PB N="214" REF="225">
may appear. 'Tis certain we cannot take plea&s;ure in any di&s;cour&s;e, where our judg|ment gives no a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e images which are pre&s;ented to our fancy. The conver&s;a|tion of tho&s;e, who have acquir'd a habit of lying, tho' in affairs of no moment, never gives any &s;atisfaction; and that becau&s;e tho&s;e ideas they pre&s;ent to us, not being attended with belief, make no impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind. Poets them&s;elves, tho' liars by pro|fe&s;&s;ion, always endeavour to give an air of truth to their fictions; and where that is to|tally neglected, their performances, however ingenious, will never be able to afford much plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, we may ob&s;erve, that even when ideas have no manner of influence on the will and pa&s;&s;ions, truth and reality are &s;till requi&s;ite, in order to make them en|tertaining to the imagination.</P>
<P>BUT if we compare together all the phae|nomena that occur on this head, we &s;hall find, that truth, however nece&s;&s;ary it may &s;eem in all works of genius, has no other effect than to procure an ea&s;y reception for the ideas, and to make the mind acquie&s;ce in them with &s;atisfaction, or at lea&s;t without reluctance. But as this is an effect, which may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to flow from that &s;o|lidity
<PB N="215" REF="226">
and force, which, according to my &s;y&s;tem, attend tho&s;e ideas that are e&s;tabli&s;h'd by rea&s;onings from cau&s;ation; it follows, that all the influence of belief upon the fancy may be explained from that &s;y&s;tem. Ac|cordingly we may ob&s;erve, that wherever that influence ari&s;es from any other principles be|&s;ide truth or reality, they &s;upply its place, and give an equal entertainment to the ima|gination. Poets have form'd what they call a poetical &s;y&s;tem of things, which tho' it be believ'd neither by them&s;elves nor readers, is commonly e&s;teem'd a &s;ufficient foundation for any fiction. We have been &s;o much accu&s;tom'd to the names of MARS, JUPITER, VENUS, that in the &s;ame manner as education infixes any opinion, the con&s;tant repetition of the&s;e ideas makes them enter into the mind with facility, and prevail upon the fancy, without influencing the judgment. In like manner tragedians always borrow their fable, or at lea&s;t the names of their principal actors, from &s;ome known pa&s;&s;age in hi&s;tory; and that not in order to deceive the &s;pectators; for they will frankly confe&s;s, that truth is not in any circum&s;tance inviolably ob&s;erved; but in or|der to procure a more ea&s;y reception into the imagination for tho&s;e extraordinary events, which they repre&s;ent. But this is a precau|tion,
<PB N="216" REF="227">
which is not required of comic poets, who&s;e per&s;onages and incidents, being of a more familiar kind, enter ea&s;ily into the con|ception, and are received without any &s;uch formality, even tho' at fir&s;t &s;ight they be known to be fictitious, and the pure off|&s;pring of the fancy.</P>
<P>THIS mixture of truth and fal&s;hood in the fables of tragic poets not only &s;erves our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, by &s;hewing, that the ima|gination can be &s;atisfy'd without any ab&s;olute belief or a&s;&s;urance; but may in another view be regarded as a very &s;trong confirmation of this &s;y&s;tem. 'Tis evident, that poets make u&s;e of this artifice of borrowing the names of their per&s;ons, and the chief events of their poems, from hi&s;tory, in order to procure a more ea&s;y reception for the whole, and cau&s;e it to make a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy and affections. The &s;everal incidents of the piece acquire a kind of relation by being uni|ted into one poem or repre&s;entation; and if any of the&s;e incidents be an object of belief, it be&s;tows a force and vivacity on the others, which are related to it. The vividne&s;s of the fir&s;t conception diffu&s;es it&s;elf along the relations, and is convey'd, as by &s;o many pipes or canals, to every idea that has any communication with the primary one. This,
<PB N="217" REF="228">
indeed, can never amount to a perfect a&s;&s;ur|rance; and that becau&s;e the union among the ideas is, in a manner, accidental: But &s;till it approaches &s;o near, in its influence, as may convince us, that they are deriv'd from the &s;ame origin. Belief mu&s;t plea&s;e the imagination by means of the force and vivacity which attends it; &s;ince every idea, which has force and vivacity, is found to be agreeable to that faculty.</P>
<P>To confirm this we may ob&s;erve, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance is mutual betwixt the judgment and fancy, as well as betwixt the judgment and pa&s;&s;ion; and that belief not only gives vigour to the imagination, but that a vigorous and &s;trong imagination is of all talents the mo&s;t proper to procure belief and authority. 'Tis difficult for us to withold our a&s;&s;ent from what is painted out to us in all the co|lours of eloquence; and the vivacity pro|duc'd by the fancy is in many ca&s;es greater than that which ari&s;es from cu&s;tom and expe|rience. We are hurried away by the lively imagination of our author or companion; and even he him&s;elf is often a victim to his own fire and genius.</P>
<P>NOR will it be ami&s;s to remark, that as a lively imagination very often degenerates into madne&s;s or folly, and bears it a great
<PB N="218" REF="229" MS="y">
re&s;emblance in its operations; &s;o they in|fluence the judgment after the &s;ame manner, and produce belief from the very &s;ame prin|ciples. When the imagination, from any extraordinary ferment of the blood and &s;pi|rits, acquires &s;uch a vivacity as di&s;orders all its powers and faculties, there is no means of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt truth and fal&s;hood; but every loo&s;e fiction or idea, having the &s;ame influence as the impre&s;&s;ions of the me|mory, or the conclu&s;ions of the judgment, is receiv'd on the &s;ame footing, and operates with equal force on the pa&s;&s;ions. A pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion and a cu&s;tomary tran&s;ition are now no longer nece&s;&s;ary to inliven our ideas. Eve|ry chimera of the brain is as vivid and in|ten&s;e as any of tho&s;e inferences, which we formerly dignify'd with the name of con|clu&s;ions concerning matters of fact, and &s;ometimes as the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve the &s;ame effect of poetry in a le&s;&s;er degree; only with this difference, that the lea&s;t reflection di&s;&s;ipates the illu&s;ions of poetry, and places the objects in their proper light. 'Tis however certain, that in the warmth of a poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m, a poet has a counterfeit belief, and even a kind of vi&s;ion of his objects: And if there be any
<PB N="219" REF="230">
&s;hadow of argument to &s;upport this belief, nothing contributes more to his full con|viction than a blaze of poetical figures and images, which have their effect upon the poet him&s;elf, as well as upon his readers.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. <HI>Of the probability of chances.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT in order to be&s;tow on this &s;y&s;tem its full force and evidence, we mu&s;t carry our eye from it a moment to con&s;ider its con&s;equences, and explain from the &s;ame principles &s;ome other &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, which are deriv'd from the &s;ame origin.</P>
<P>THOSE philo&s;ophers, who have divided human rea&s;on into <HI>knowledge and probability,</HI> and have defin'd the fir&s;t to be <HI>that evi|dence, which ari&s;es from the compari&s;on of ideas,</HI> are oblig'd to comprehend all our ar|guments from cau&s;es or effects under the general term of probability. But tho' every one be free to u&s;e his terms in what &s;en&s;e he plea&s;es; and accordingly in the precedent part of this di&s;cour&s;e, I have follow'd this method of expre&s;&s;ion; 'tis however certain, that in common di&s;cour&s;e we readily affirm,
<PB N="220" REF="231">
that many arguments from cau&s;ation exceed probability, and may be receiv'd as a &s;upe|rior kind of evidence. One wou'd appear ridiculous, who wou'd &s;ay, that 'tis only probable the &s;un will ri&s;e to-morrow, or that all men mu&s;t dye; tho' 'tis plain we have no further a&s;&s;urance of the&s;e facts, than what experience affords us. For this rea&s;on, 'twould perhaps be more convenient, in order at once to pre&s;erve the common &s;ignification of words, and mark the &s;everal degrees of evidence, to di&s;tingui&s;h human rea&s;on into three kinds, viz. <HI>that from knowledge, from proofs, and from probabili|ties.</HI> By knowledge, I mean the a&s;&s;urance ari&s;ing from the compari&s;on of ideas. By proofs, tho&s;e arguments, which are deriv'd from the relation of cau&s;e and effect, and which are entirely free from doubt and un|certainty. By probability, that evidence, which is &s;till attended with uncertainty. 'Tis this la&s;t &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, I proceed to examine.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY or rea&s;oning from con|jecture may be divided into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> that which is founded on <HI>chance,</HI> and that which ari&s;es from <HI>cau&s;es.</HI> We &s;hall con&s;i|der each of the&s;e in order.</P>
<P>THE idea of cau&s;e and effect is deriv'd
<PB N="221" REF="232">
from experience, which pre&s;enting us with certain objects con&s;tantly conjoin'd with each other, produces &s;uch a habit of &s;urveying them in that relation, that we cannot with|out a &s;en&s;ible violence &s;urvey them in any other. On the other hand, as chance is no|thing real in it&s;elf, and properly, &s;peaking, is merely the negation of a cau&s;e, its influence on the mind is contrary to that of cau&s;a|tion; and 'tis e&s;&s;ential to it, to leave the imagination perfectly indifferent, either to con&s;ider the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of that object, which is regarded as contingent. A cau&s;e traces the way to our thought, and in a manner forces us to &s;urvey &s;uch cer|tain objects, in &s;uch certain relations. Chance can only de&s;troy this determination of the thought, and leave the mind in its native &s;ituation of indifference; in which, upon the ab&s;ence of a cau&s;e, 'tis in&s;tantly re-in&s;tated.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore an entire indifference is e&s;&s;ential to chance, no one chance can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uperior to another, otherwi&s;e than as it is compos'd of a &s;uperior number of equal chances. For if we affirm that one chance can, after any other manner, be &s;uperior to another, we mu&s;t at the &s;ame time affirm, that there is &s;omething, which gives it the
<PB N="222" REF="233">
&s;uperiority, and determines the event rather to that &s;ide than the other: That is, in o|ther words, we mu&s;t allow of a cau&s;e, and de&s;troy the &s;uppo&s;ition of chance; which we had before e&s;tabli&s;h'd. A perfect and total indifference is e&s;&s;ential to chance, and one total indifference can never in it&s;elf be either &s;uperior or inferior to another. This truth is not peculiar to my &s;y&s;tem, but is acknowledg'd by every one, that forms cal|culations concerning chances.</P>
<P>AND here 'tis remarkable, that tho' chance and cau&s;ation be directly contrary, yet 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to conceive this combination of chances, which is requi&s;ite to render one hazard &s;uperior to another, without &s;uppo&s;ing a mixture of cau&s;es a|mong the chances, and a conjunction of nece&s;&s;ity in &s;ome particulars, with a total indifference in others. Where nothing li|mits the chances, every notion, that the mo&s;t extravagant fancy can form, is upon a footing of equality; nor can there be any circum&s;tance to give one the advantage a|bove another. Thus unle&s;s we allow, that there are &s;ome cau&s;es to make the dice fall, and pre&s;erve their form in their fall, and lie upon &s;ome one of their &s;ides, we can form no calculation concerning the laws of ha|zard.
<PB N="223" REF="234">
But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e cau&s;es to ope|rate, and &s;uppo&s;ing likewi&s;e all the re&s;t to be indifferent and to be determin'd by chance, 'tis ea&s;y to arrive at a notion of a &s;uperior combination of chances. A dye, that has four &s;ides mark'd with a certain number of &s;pots, and only two with ano|ther, affords us an obvious and ea&s;y in&s;tance of this &s;uperiority. The mind is here li|mited by the cau&s;es to &s;uch a preci&s;e num|ber and quality of the events; and at the &s;ame time is undetermin'd in its choice of any particular event.</P>
<P>PROCEEDING then in that rea&s;oning, wherein we have advanc'd three &s;teps; <HI>that</HI> chance is merely the negation of a cau&s;e, and produces a total indifference in the mind; <HI>that</HI> one negation of a cau&s;e and one total indifference can never be &s;uperior or inferior to another; and <HI>that</HI> there mu&s;t always be a mixture of cau&s;es among the chances, in order to be the foundation of any rea&s;oning: We are next to con&s;ider what effect a &s;uperior combination of chances can have upon the mind, and after what man|ner it influences our judgment and opinion. Here we may repeat all the &s;ame arguments we employ'd in examining that belief, which ari&s;es from cau&s;es; and may prove after the
<PB N="224" REF="235">
&s;ame manner, that a &s;uperior number of chances produces our a&s;&s;ent neither by <HI>de|mon&s;tration</HI> nor <HI>probability.</HI> 'Tis indeed e|vident, that we can never by the compari|&s;on of mere ideas make any di&s;covery, which can be of con&s;equence in this affair, and that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to prove with cer|tainty, that any event mu&s;t fall on that &s;ide where there is a &s;uperior number of chances. To &s;uppo&s;e in this ca&s;e any certainty, were to overthrow what we have e&s;tabli&s;h'd con|cerning the oppo&s;ition of chances, and their perfect equality and indifference.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it be &s;aid, that tho' in an oppo|&s;ition of chances 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to determine with <HI>certainty,</HI> on which &s;ide the event will fall, yet we can pronounce with certainty, that 'tis more likely and probable, 'twill be on that &s;ide where there is a &s;uperior num|ber of chances, than where there is an in|ferior: Shou'd this be &s;aid, I wou'd a&s;k, what is here meant by <HI>likelihood and pro|bability?</HI> The likelihood and probability of chances is a &s;uperior number of equal chan|ces; and con&s;equently when we &s;ay 'tis likely the event will fall on the &s;ide, which is &s;uperior, rather than on the inferior, we do no more than affirm, that where there is a &s;uperior number of chances there is ac|actually
<PB N="225" REF="236">
a &s;uperior, and where there is an inferior there is an inferior; which are iden|tical propo&s;itions, and of no con&s;equence. The que&s;tion is, by what means a &s;uperior number of equal chances operates upon the mind, and produces belief or a&s;&s;ent; &s;ince it appears, that 'tis neither by arguments deriv'd from demon&s;tration, nor from pro|bability.</P>
<P>IN order to clear up this difficulty, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on to take a dye, form'd after &s;uch a manner as that four of its &s;ides are mark'd with one figure, or one number of &s;pots, and two with another; and to put this dye into the box with an intention of throwing it: 'Tis plain, he mu&s;t conclude the one figure to be more probable than the other, and give the preference to that which is in|&s;crib'd on the greate&s;t number of &s;ides. He in a manner believes, that this will lie up|permo&s;t; tho' &s;till with he&s;itation and doubt, in proportion to the number of chances, which are contrary: And according as the&s;e contrary chances dimini&s;h, and the &s;uperio|rity encrea&s;es on the other &s;ide, his belief acquires new degrees of &s;tability and a&s;&s;u|rance. This belief ari&s;es from an operation of the mind upon the &s;imple and limited object before us; and therefore its nature
<PB N="226" REF="237">
will be the more ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd and ex|plain'd. We have nothing but one &s;ingle dye to contemplate, in order to comprehend one of the mo&s;t curious operations of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THIS dye form'd as above, contains three circum&s;tances worthy of our attention. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Certain cau&s;es, &s;uch as gravity, &s;olidity, a cubical figure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which determine it to fall, to pre&s;erve its form in its fall, and to turn up one of its &s;ides. <HI>Secondly,</HI> A certain number of &s;ides, which are &s;uppos'd indif|ferent. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A certain figure, in&s;crib'd on each &s;ide. The&s;e three particulars form the whole nature of the dye, &s;o far as re|lates to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; and con&s;e|quently are the only circum&s;tances regarded by the mind in its forming a judgment con|cerning the re&s;ult of &s;uch a throw. Let us, therefore, con&s;ider gradually and carefully what mu&s;t be the influence of the&s;e circum|&s;tances on the thought and imagination.</P>
<P>FIRST, We have already ob&s;erv'd, that the mind is determin'd by cu&s;tom to pa&s;s from any cau&s;e to its effect, and that upon the appearance of the one, 'tis almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for it not to form an idea of the other. Their con&s;tant conjunction in pa&s;t in&s;tances has produc'd &s;uch a habit in the
<PB N="227" REF="238">
mind, that it always conjoins them in its thought, and infers the exi&s;tence of the one from that of its u&s;ual attendant. When it con&s;iders the dye as no longer &s;upported by the box, it cannot without violence regard it as &s;u&s;pended in the air; but naturally places it on the table, and views it as turn|ing up one of its &s;ides. This is the effect of the intermingled cau&s;es, which are re|qui&s;ite to our forming any calculation con|cerning chances.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, 'Tis &s;uppos'd, that tho' the dye be nece&s;&s;arily determin'd to fall, and turn up one of its &s;ides, yet there is nothing to fix the particular &s;ide, but that this is determin'd entirely by chance. The very nature and e&s;&s;ence of chance is a negation of cau&s;es, and the leaving the mind in a perfect indifference among tho&s;e events, which are &s;uppos'd contingent. When there|fore the thought is determin'd by the cau&s;es to con&s;ider the dye as falling and turning up one of its &s;ides, the chances pre&s;ent all the&s;e &s;ides as equal, and make us con&s;ider every one of them, one after another, as alike probable and po&s;&s;ible. The imagina|tion pa&s;&s;es from the cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the throw|ing of the dye, to the effect, <HI>viz.</HI> the turning up one of the &s;ix &s;ides; and feels a
<PB N="228" REF="239">
kind of impo&s;&s;ibility both of &s;topping &s;hort in the way, and of forming any other idea. But as all the&s;e &s;ix &s;ides are incompatible, and the dye cannot turn up above one at once, this principle directs us not to con|&s;ider all of them at once as lying upper|mo&s;t; which we look upon as impo&s;&s;ible: Neither does it direct us with its entire force to any particular &s;ide; for in that ca&s;e this &s;ide wou'd be con&s;ider'd as certain and in|evitable; but it directs us to the whole &s;ix &s;ides after &s;uch a manner as to divide its force equally among them. We conclude in general, that &s;ome one of them mu&s;t re|&s;ult from the throw: We run all of them over in our minds: The determination of the thought is common to all; but no more of its force falls to the &s;hare of any one, than what is &s;uitable to its proportion with the re&s;t. 'Tis after this manner the origi|nal impul&s;e, and con&s;equently the vivacity of thought, ari&s;ing from the cau&s;es, is di|vided and &s;plit in pieces by the intermingled chances.</P>
<P>WE have already &s;een the influence of the two fir&s;t qualities of the dye, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>indifference</HI> of the &s;ides, and have learn'd how they give an impul&s;e to the thought, and divide that
<PB N="229" REF="240">
impul&s;e into as many parts as there are u|nites in the number of &s;ides. We mu&s;t now con&s;ider the effects of the third particular, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>figures</HI> in&s;crib'd on each &s;ide. 'Tis evident that where &s;everal &s;ides have the &s;ame figure in&s;crib'd on them, they mu&s;t concur in their influence on the mind, and mu&s;t unite upon one image or idea of a fi|gure all tho&s;e divided impul&s;es, that were di&s;pers'd over the &s;everal &s;ides, upon which that figure is in&s;crib'd. Were the que&s;tion only what &s;ide will be turn'd up, the&s;e are all perfectly equal, and no one cou'd ever have any advantage above another. But as the que&s;tion is concerning the figure, and as the &s;ame figure is pre&s;ented by more than one &s;ide; 'tis evident, that the impul&s;es be|longing to all the&s;e &s;ides mu&s;t re-unite in that one figure, and become &s;tronger and more forcible by the union. Four &s;ides are &s;uppos'd in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to have the &s;ame figure in&s;crib'd on them, and two to have another figure. The impul&s;es of the former are, therefore, &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the latter. But as the events are contrary, and 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible both the&s;e figures can be turn'd up; the impul&s;es likewi&s;e become contrary, and the inferior de&s;troys the &s;uperior, as far as its &s;trength goes. The vivacity of the idea

is always proportionable to the degrees of the impul&s;e or tendency to the tran&s;ition; and belief is the &s;ame with the vivacity of the idea, according to the precedent doc|trine.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. <HI>Of the probability of cau&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT I have &s;aid concerning the probability of chances can &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in ex|plaining the probability of cau&s;es; &s;ince 'tis commonly allow'd by philo&s;ophers, that what the vulgar call chance is nothing but a &s;ecret and conceal'd cau&s;e. That &s;pecies of probability, therefore, is what we mu&s;t chiefly examine.</P>
<P>THE probabilities of cau&s;es are of &s;everal kinds; but are all deriv'd from the &s;ame origin, <HI>viz. the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas to a pre|&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion.</HI> As the habit, which pro|duces the a&s;&s;ociation, ari&s;es from the frequent conjunction of objects, it mu&s;t arrive at its perfection by degrees, and mu&s;t acquire new force from each in&s;tance, that falls under our ob&s;ervation. The fir&s;t in&s;tance has lit|tle or no force: The &s;econd makes &s;ome
<PB N="231" REF="242">
addition to it: The third becomes &s;till more &s;en&s;ible; and 'tis by the&s;e &s;low &s;teps, that our judgment arrives at a full a&s;&s;urance. But before it attains this pitch of perfection, it pa&s;&s;es thro' &s;everal inferior degrees, and in all of them is only to be e&s;teem'd a pre|&s;umption or probability. The gradation, therefore, from probabilities to proofs is in many ca&s;es in&s;en&s;ible; and the difference be|twixt the&s;e kinds of evidence is more ea&s;ily perceiv'd in the remote degrees, than in the near and contiguous.</P>
<P>'TIS worthy of remark on this occa&s;ion, that tho' the &s;pecies of probability here ex|plain'd be the fir&s;t in order, and naturally takes place before any entire proof can ex|i&s;t, yet no one, who is arriv'd at the age of maturity, can any longer be acquainted with it. 'Tis true, nothing is more common than for people of the mo&s;t advanc'd know|ledge to have attain'd only an imperfect expe|rience of many particular events; which na|turally produces only an imperfect habit and tran&s;ition: But then we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the mind, having form'd another ob|&s;ervation concerning the connexion of cau&s;es and effects, gives new force to its rea&s;oning from that ob&s;ervation; and by means of it can build an argument on one &s;ingle
<PB N="232" REF="243">
experiment, when duly prepar'd and ex|amin'd. What we have found once to fol|low from any object, we conclude will for ever follow from it; and if this maxim be not always built upon as certain, 'tis not for want of a &s;ufficient number of experiments, but becau&s;e we frequently meet with in&s;tances to the contrary; which leads us to the &s;econd &s;pecies of probability, where there is a <HI>contra|riety</HI> in our experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>'TWOU'D be very happy for men in the conduct of their lives and actions, were the &s;ame objects always conjoin'd together, and we had nothing to fear but the mi&s;takes of our own judgment, without having any rea&s;on to apprehend the uncertainty of na|ture. But as 'tis frequently found, that one ob&s;ervation is contrary to another, and that cau&s;es and effects follow not in the &s;ame order, of which we have had expe|rience, we are oblig'd to vary our rea&s;oning on account of this uncertainty, and take into con&s;ideration the contrariety of events. The fir&s;t que&s;tion, that occurs on this head, is concerning the nature and cau&s;es of the contrariety.</P>
<P>THE vulgar, who take things according to their fir&s;t appearance, attribute the un|certainty of events to &s;uch an uncertainty in
<PB N="233" REF="244">
the cau&s;es, as makes them often fail of their u&s;ual influence, tho' they meet with no ob|&s;tacle nor impediment in their operation. But philo&s;ophers ob&s;erving, that almo&s;t in every part of nature there is contain'd a va&s;t variety of &s;prings and principles, which are hid, by rea&s;on of their minutene&s;s or re|motene&s;s, find that 'tis at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cau&s;e, but from the &s;ecret operation of contrary cau&s;es. This po&s;&s;ibility is converted into certainty by far|ther ob&s;ervation, when they remark, that upon an exact &s;crutiny, a contrariety of ef|fects always betrays a contrariety of cau&s;es, and proceeds from their mutual hindrance and oppo&s;ition. A pea&s;ant can give no bet|ter rea&s;on for the &s;topping of any clock or watch than to &s;ay, that commonly it does not go right: But an artizan ea&s;ily perceives, that the &s;ame force in the &s;pring or pendu|lum has always the &s;ame influence on the wheels; but fails of its u&s;ual effect, perhaps by rea&s;on of a grain of du&s;t, which puts a &s;top to the whole movement. From the ob&s;ervation of &s;everal parallel in&s;tances, phi|lo&s;ophers form a maxim, that the connexion betwixt all cau&s;es and effects is equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and that its &s;eeming uncertainty in
<PB N="234" REF="245">
&s;ome in&s;tances proceeds from the &s;ecret op|po&s;ition of contrary cau&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT however philo&s;ophers and the vulgar may differ in their explication of the con|trariety of events, their inferences from it are always of the &s;ame kind, and founded on the &s;ame principles. A contrariety of events in the pa&s;t may give us a kind of he&s;itating belief for the future after two &s;e|veral ways. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By producing an im|perfect habit and tran&s;ition from the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion to the related idea. When the conjunction of any two objects is frequent, without being entirely con&s;tant, the mind is determin'd to pa&s;s from one object to the other; but not with &s;o entire a habit, as when the union is uninterrupted, and all the in&s;tances we have ever met with are uniform and of a piece. We find from com|mon experience, in our actions as well as rea&s;onings, that a con&s;tant per&s;everance in any cour&s;e of life produces a &s;trong inclination and tendency to continue for the future; tho' there are habits of inferior degrees of force, proportion'd to the inferior degrees of &s;teadine&s;s and uniformity in our conduct.</P>
<P>THERE is no doubt but this principle &s;ometimes takes place, and produces tho&s;e inferences we draw from contrary phaeno|mena;
<PB N="235" REF="246">
tho' I am per&s;waded, that upon ex|amination we &s;hall not find it to be the principle, that mo&s;t commonly influences the mind in this &s;pecies of rea&s;oning. When we follow only the habitual determination of the mind, we make the tran&s;ition with|out any reflection, and interpo&s;e not a mo|ments delay betwixt the view of one object and the belief of that, which is often found to attend it. As the cu&s;tom depends not upon any deliberation, it operates immediately, without allowing any time for reflection. But this method of proceeding we have but few in&s;tances of in our probable rea&s;onings; and even fewer than in tho&s;e, which are deriv'd from the uninterupted conjunction of objects. In the former &s;pecies of rea&s;oning we commonly take knowingly into con&s;i|deration the contrariety of pa&s;t events; we compare the different &s;ides of the contra|riety, and carefully weigh the experiments, which we have on each &s;ide: Whence we may conclude, that our rea&s;onings of this kind ari&s;e not <HI>directly</HI> from the habit, but in an <HI>oblique</HI> manner; which we mu&s;t now endeavour to explain.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that when an object is at|tended with contrary effects, we judge of them only by our pa&s;t experience, and al|ways
<PB N="236" REF="247">
con&s;ider tho&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, which we have ob&s;erv'd to follow from it. And as pa&s;t experience regulates our judgment con|cerning the po&s;&s;ibility of the&s;e effects, &s;o it does that concerning their probability; and that effect, which has been the mo&s;t com|mon, we always e&s;teem the mo&s;t likely. Here then are two things to be con&s;ider'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> which determine us to make the pa&s;t a &s;tandard for the future, and the <HI>manner</HI> how we extract a &s;ingle judgment from a contrariety of pa&s;t events.</P>
<P>FIRST we may ob&s;erve, that the &s;up|po&s;ition, <HI>that the future re&s;embles the pa&s;t,</HI> is not founded on arguments of any kind, but is deriv'd entirely from habit, by which we are determin'd to expect for the future the &s;ame train of objects, to which we have been accu&s;tom'd. This habit or determina|tion to transfer the pa&s;t to the future is full and perfect; and con&s;equently the fir&s;t im|pul&s;e of the imagination in this &s;pecies of rea&s;oning is endow'd with the &s;ame qua|lities.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> when in con&s;idering pa&s;t experiments we find them of a contrary na|ture, this determination, tho' full and per|fect in it&s;elf, pre&s;ents us with no &s;teady object, but offers us a number of di&s;agreeing
<PB N="237" REF="248">
images in a certain order and proportion. The fir&s;t impul&s;e, therefore, is here broke into pieces, and diffu&s;es it&s;elf over all tho&s;e images, of which each partakes an equal &s;hare of that force and vivacity, that is de|riv'd from the impul&s;e. Any of the&s;e pa&s;t events may again happen; and we judge, that when they do happen, they will be mix'd in the &s;ame proportion as in the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>IF our intention, therefore, be to con&s;i|der the proportions of contrary events in a great number of in&s;tances, the images pre|&s;ented by our pa&s;t experience mu&s;t remain in their <HI>fir&s;t form,</HI> and pre&s;erve their fir&s;t proportions. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, I have found by long ob&s;ervation, that of twenty &s;hips, which go to &s;ea, only nineteen re|turn. Suppo&s;e I &s;ee at pre&s;ent twenty &s;hips that leave the port: I transfer my pa&s;t ex|perience to the future, and repre&s;ent to my &s;elf nineteen of the&s;e &s;hips as returning in &s;afety, and one as peri&s;hing. Concerning this there can be no difficulty. But as we frequently run over tho&s;e &s;everal ideas of pa&s;t events, in order to form a judgment concern|ing one &s;ingle event, which appears uncer|tain; this con&s;ideration mu&s;t change the <HI>fir&s;t form</HI> of our ideas, and draw together the
<PB N="238" REF="249">
divided images pre&s;ented by experience; &s;ince 'tis to <HI>it</HI> we refer the determination of that particular event, upon which we rea&s;on. Many of the&s;e images are &s;uppos'd to con|cur, and a &s;uperior number to concur on one &s;ide. The&s;e agreeing images unite together, and render the idea more &s;trong and lively, not only than a mere fiction of the imagi|nation, but al&s;o than any idea, which is &s;upported by a le&s;&s;er number of experiments. Each new experiment is as a new &s;troke of the pencil, which be&s;tows an additional vi|vacity on the colours, without either mul|tiplying or enlarging the figure. This ope|ration of the mind has been &s;o fully ex|plain'd in treating of the probability of chance, that I need not here endeavour to render it more intelligible. Every pa&s;t experiment may be con&s;ider'd as a kind of chance; it being uncertain to us, whether the object will exi&s;t conformable to one experiment or another: And for this rea&s;on every thing that has been &s;aid on the one &s;ubject is ap|plicable to both.</P>
<P>THUS upon the whole, contrary experi|ments produce an imperfect belief, either by weakening the habit, or by dividing and afterwards joining in different parts, that <HI>per|fect</HI> habit, which makes us conclude in ge|neral,
<PB N="239" REF="250">
that in&s;tances, of which we have no experience, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;emble tho&s;e of which we have.</P>
<P>TO ju&s;tify &s;till farther this account of the &s;econd &s;pecies of probability, where we rea|&s;on with knowledge and reflection from a contrariety of pa&s;t experiments, I &s;hall pro|po&s;e the following con&s;iderations, without fearing to give offence by that air of &s;ub|tilty, which attends them. Ju&s;t rea&s;oning ought &s;till, perhaps, to retain its force, how|ever &s;ubtile; in the &s;ame manner as matter pre&s;erves its &s;olidity in the air, and fire, and animal &s;pirits, as well as in the gro&s;&s;er and more &s;en&s;ible forms.</P>
<P>FIRST, We may ob&s;erve, that there is no probability &s;o great as not to allow of a con|trary po&s;&s;ibility; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e 'twou'd cea&s;e to be a probability, and wou'd become a certainty. That probability of cau&s;es, which is mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and which we at pre&s;ent examine, depends on a contrariety of expe|riments; and 'tis evident an experiment in the pa&s;t proves at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility for the future.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The component parts of this po&s;&s;ibility and probability are of the &s;ame nature, and differ in number only, but not in kind. It has been ob&s;erv'd, that all &s;ingle
<PB N="240" REF="251">
chances are entirely equal, and that the only circum&s;tance, which can give any event, that is contingent, a &s;uperiority over another, is a &s;uperior number of chances. In like man|ner, as the uncertainty of cau&s;es is di&s;cover'd by experience, which pre&s;ents us with a view of contrary events, 'tis plain, that as we transfer the pa&s;t to the future, the known to the unknown, every pa&s;t experiment has the &s;ame weight, and that 'tis only a &s;upe|rior number of them, which can throw the ballance on any &s;ide. The po&s;&s;ibility, therefore, which enters into every rea&s;on|ing of this kind, is compos'd of parts, which are of the &s;ame nature both among them|&s;elves, and with tho&s;e, that compo&s;e the oppo&s;ite probability.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a cer|tain maxim, that in all moral as well as na|tural phaenomena, wherever any cau&s;e con|&s;i&s;ts of a number of parts, and the effect encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes, according to the va|riation of that number, the effect, properly &s;peaking, is a compounded one, and ari&s;es from the union of the &s;everal effects, that proceed from each part of the cau&s;e. Thus becau&s;e the gravity of a body encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes by the encrea&s;e or diminution of its parts, we conclude that each part con|tains
<PB N="241" REF="252">
this quality and contributes to the gra|vity of the whole. The ab&s;ence or pre&s;ence of a part of the cau&s;e is attended with that of a proportionable part of the effect. This connexion or con&s;tant conjunction &s;uffici|ently proves the one part to be the cau&s;e of the other. As the belief, which we have of any event, encrea&s;es or dimini&s;hes according to the number of chances or pa&s;t experiments, 'tis to be con&s;ider'd as a com|pounded effect, of which each part ari&s;es from a proportionable number of chances or experiments.</P>
<P>LET us now join the&s;e three ob&s;erva|tions, and &s;ee what conclu&s;ion we can draw from them. To every probability there is an oppo&s;ite po&s;&s;ibility. This po&s;&s;ibility is compos'd of parts, that are entirely of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e of the probabi|lity; and con&s;equently have the &s;ame in|fluence on the mind and under&s;tanding. The belief, which attends the probabili|ty, is a compounded effect, and is form'd by the concurrence of the &s;everal effects, which proceed from each part of the pro|bability. Since therefore each part of the probability contributes to the production of the belief, each part of the po&s;&s;ibility mu&s;t have the &s;ame influence on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide;
<PB N="242" REF="253">
the nature of the&s;e parts being entirely the &s;ame. The contrary belief, attending the po&s;&s;ibility, implies a view of a certain ob|ject, as well as the probability does an op|po&s;ite view. In this particular both the&s;e degrees of belief are alike. The only man|ner then, in which the &s;uperior number of &s;imilar component parts in the one can ex|ert its influence, and prevail above the in|ferior in the other, is by producing a &s;tronger and more lively view of its object. Each part pre&s;ents a particular view; and all the&s;e views uniting together produce one general view, which is fuller and more di&s;tinct by the greater number of cau&s;es or principles, from which it is deriv'd.</P>
<P>THE component parts of the probability and po&s;&s;ibility, being alike in their nature, mu&s;t produce like effects; and the likene&s;s of their effects con&s;i&s;ts in this, that each of them pre&s;ents a view of a particular object, But tho' the&s;e parts be alike in their na|ture, they are very different in their quan|tity and number; and this difference mu&s;t appear in the effect as well as the &s;imilarity. Now as the view they pre&s;ent is in both ca&s;es full and entire, and comprehends the object in all its parts, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that in this particular there can be any difference;
<PB N="243" REF="254">
nor is there any thing but a &s;uperior viva|city in the probability, ari&s;ing from the con|currence of a &s;uperior number of views, which can di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e effects.</P>
<P>HERE is almo&s;t the &s;ame argument in a different light. All our rea&s;onings concern|ing the probability of cau&s;es are founded on the transferring of pa&s;t to future. The tran&s;|ferring of any pa&s;t experiment to the future is &s;ufficient to give us a view of the object; whether that experiment be &s;ingle, or com|bin'd with others of the &s;ame kind; whe|ther it be entire, or oppos'd by others of a contrary kind. Suppo&s;e, then, it acquires both the&s;e qualities of combination and op|po&s;ition, it lo&s;es not upon that account its former power of pre&s;enting a view of the object, but only concurs with and oppo&s;es other experiments, that have a like influence. A que&s;tion, therefore, may ari&s;e concern|ing the manner both of the concurrence and oppo&s;ition. As to the <HI>concurrence,</HI> there is only the choice left betwixt the&s;e two hypothe&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the view of the object, occa&s;ion'd by the transference of each pa&s;t experiment, pre&s;erves it&s;elf entire, and only multiplies the number of views. Or, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> That it runs into the other &s;imilar and corre&s;pondent views, and gives them a
<PB N="244" REF="255">
&s;uperior degree of force and vivacity. But that the fir&s;t hypothe&s;is is erroneous, is evi|dent from experience, which informs us, that the belief, attending any rea&s;oning, con&s;i&s;ts in one conclu&s;ion, not in a multitude of &s;imilar ones, which wou'd only di&s;tract the mind, and in many ca&s;es wou'd be too nu|merous to be comprehended di&s;tinctly by any finite capacity. It remains, therefore, as the only rea&s;onable opinion, that the&s;e &s;imilar views run into each other, and unite their forces; &s;o as to produce a &s;tronger and clearer view, than what ari&s;es from any one alone. This is the manner, in which pa&s;t experi|ments concur, when they are transfer'd to any future event. As to the manner of their <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> 'tis evident, that as the contrary views are incompatible with each other, and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the object can at once exi&s;t conformable to both of them, their influence becomes mutually de&s;tructive, and the mind is determin'd tothe &s;uperior only with that force, which remains after &s;ub&s;tracting the inferior.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible how ab&s;tru&s;e all this rea|&s;oning mu&s;t appear to the generality of rea|ders, who not being accu&s;tom'd to &s;uch pro|found reflections on the intellectual facul|ties of the mind, will be apt to reject as chi|merical whatever &s;trikes not in with the
<PB N="245" REF="256">
common receiv'd notions, and with the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t obvious principles of philo|&s;ophy. And no doubt there are &s;ome pains requir'd to enter into the&s;e arguments; tho' perhaps very little are nece&s;&s;ary to perceive the imperfection of every vulgar hypothe&s;is on this &s;ubject, and the little light, which philo&s;ophy can yet afford us in &s;uch &s;ublime and &s;uch curious &s;peculations. Let men be once fully per&s;waded of the&s;e two principles, <HI>That there is nothing in any object, con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, which can afford us a rea&s;on for draw|ing a conclu&s;ion beyond it;</HI> and, <HI>That even after the ob&s;ervation of the frequent or con|&s;tant conjunction of objects, we have no rea&s;on to draw any inference concerning any object beyond tho&s;e of which we have had experience;</HI> I &s;ay, let men be once fully convinc'd of the&s;e two principles, and this will throw them &s;o loo&s;e from all common &s;y&s;tems, that they will make no difficulty of receiving any, which may appear the mo&s;t extraordi|nary. The&s;e principles we have found to be &s;ufficiently convincing, even with regard to our mo&s;t certain rea&s;onings from cau&s;ation: But I &s;hall venture to affirm, that with re|gard to the&s;e conjectural or probable rea|&s;onings they &s;till acquire a new degree of evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="257">
FIRST, 'Tis obvious, that in rea&s;onings of this kind, 'tis not the object pre&s;ented to us, which, con&s;ider'd in it&s;elf, affords us any rea&s;on to draw a conclu&s;ion concerning any other object or event. For as this lat|ter object is &s;uppos'd uncertain, and as the uncertainty is deriv'd from a conceal'd con|trariety of cau&s;es in the former, were any of the cau&s;es plac'd in the known qualities of that object, they wou'd no longer be con|ceal'd, nor wou'd our conclu&s;ion be uncer|tain.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> 'tis equally obvious in this &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, that if the transference of the pa&s;t to the future were founded mere|ly on a conclu&s;ion of the under&s;tanding, it cou'd never occa&s;ion any belief or a&s;&s;urance. When we transfer contrary experiments to the future, we can only repeat the&s;e con|trary experiments with their particular pro|portions; which cou'd not produce a&s;&s;u|rance in any &s;ingle event, upon which we rea&s;on, unle&s;s the fancy melted together all tho&s;e images that concur, and extracted from them one &s;ingle idea or image, which is inten&s;e and lively in proportion to the num|ber of experiments from which it is de|riv'd, and their &s;uperiority above their an|tagoni&s;ts. Our pa&s;t experience pre&s;ents no
<PB N="247" REF="258">
determinate object; and as our belief, how|ever faint, fixes it&s;elf on a determinate ob|ject, 'tis evident that the belief ari&s;es not merely from the transference of pa&s;t to fu|ture, but from &s;ome operation of the <HI>fancy</HI> conjoin'd with it. This may lead us to conceive the manner, in which that faculty enters into all our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with two reflections, which may de&s;erve our attention. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> may be explain'd after this man|ner. When the mind forms a rea&s;oning concerning any matter of fact, which is on|ly probable, it ca&s;ts its eye backward upon pa&s;t experience, and transferring it to the future, is pre&s;ented with &s;o many contrary views of its object, of which tho&s;e that are of the &s;ame kind uniting together, and run|ning into one act of the mind, &s;erve to fortify and inliven it. But &s;uppo&s;e that this multitude of views or glimp&s;es of an object proceeds not from experience, but from a voluntary act of the imagination; this ef|fect does not follow, or at lea&s;t, follows not in the &s;ame degree. For tho' cu&s;tom and education produce belief by &s;uch a repeti|tion, as is not deriv'd from experience, yet this requires a long tract of time, along with a very frequent and <HI>unde&s;ign'd</HI> repetition.
<PB N="248" REF="259">
In general we may pronounce, that a per|&s;on, who wou'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>voluntarily</HI> repeat any idea in his mind, tho' &s;upported by one pa&s;t experience, wou'd be no more inclin'd to believe the exi&s;tence of its object, than if he had contented him&s;elf with one &s;ur|vey of it. Be&s;ide the effect of de&s;ign; each act of the mind, being &s;eparate and independent, has a &s;eparate influence, and joins not its force with that of its fellows. Not being united by any common object, producing them, they have no relation to each other; and con&s;equently make no tran|&s;ition or union of forces. This phaenome|non we &s;hall under&s;tand better afterwards.</P>
<P>MY <HI>&s;econd</HI> reflection is founded on tho&s;e large probabilities, which the mind can judge of, and the minute differences it can ob&s;erve betwixt them. When the chances or ex|periments on one &s;ide amount to ten thou|&s;and, and on the other to ten thou&s;and and one, the judgment gives the preference to the latter, upon account of that &s;uperiority; tho' 'tis plainly impo&s;&s;ible for the mind to run over every particular view, and di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;uperior vivacity of the image ari&s;ing from the &s;uperior number, where the dif|ference is &s;o incon&s;iderable. We have a
<PB N="249" REF="260">
parallel in&s;tance in the affections. 'Tis e|vident, according to the principles above|mention'd, that when an object produces any pa&s;&s;ion in us, which varies according to the different quantity of the object; I &s;ay, 'tis evident, that the pa&s;&s;ion, proper|ly &s;peaking, is not a &s;imple emotion, but a compounded one, of a great num|ber of weaker pa&s;&s;ions, deriv'd from a view of each part of the object. For otherwi&s;e 'twere impo&s;&s;ible the pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd encrea&s;e by the encrea&s;e of the&s;e parts. Thus a man, who de&s;ires a thou&s;and pound, has in rea|lity a thou&s;and or more de&s;ires, which u|niting together, &s;eem to make only one pa&s;&s;ion; tho' the compo&s;ition evidently be|trays it&s;elf upon every alteration of the ob|ject, by the preference he gives to the larg|er number, if &s;uperior only by an unite. Yet nothing can be more certain, than that &s;o &s;mall a difference wou'd not be di&s;|cernible in the pa&s;&s;ions, nor cou'd render them di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other. The difference, therefore, of our conduct in prefer|ring the greater number depends not upon our pa&s;&s;ions, but upon cu&s;tom, and <HI>general rules.</HI> We have found in a multitude of in&s;tances, that the augmenting the numbers of any &s;um augments the pa&s;&s;ion, where the num|bers
<PB N="250" REF="261">
are preci&s;e and the difference &s;en&s;ible. The mind can perceive from its immediate feeling, that three guineas produce a greater pa&s;&s;ion than two; and <HI>this</HI> it transfers to larger numbers, becau&s;e of the re&s;emblance; and by a general rule a&s;&s;igns to a thou&s;and guineas, a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion than to nine hun|dred and ninety nine. The&s;e general rules we &s;hall explain pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ide the&s;e two &s;pecies of probabi|ty, which are deriv'd from an <HI>imperfect</HI> ex|perience and from <HI>contrary</HI> cau&s;es, there is a third ari&s;ing from ANALOGY, which dif|fers from them in &s;ome material circum&s;tan|ces. According to the hypothe&s;is above ex|plain'd all kinds of rea&s;oning from cau&s;es or effects are founded on two particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> the con&s;tant conjunction of any two objects in all pa&s;t experience, and the re&s;emblance of a pre&s;ent object to any one of them. The effect of the&s;e two particulars is, that the pre&s;ent object invigorates and inlivens the imagination; and the re&s;emblance, along with the con&s;tant union, conveys this force and vivacity to the related idea; which we are therefore &s;aid to believe, or a&s;&s;ent to. If you weaken either the union or re&s;em|blance, you weaken the principle of tran&s;i|tion, and of con&s;equence that belief, which
<PB N="251" REF="262">
ari&s;es from it. The vivacity of the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion cannot be fully convey'd to the re|lated idea, either where the conjunction of their objects is not con&s;tant, or where the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion does not perfectly re&s;em|ble any of tho&s;e, who&s;e union we are ac|cu&s;tom'd to ob&s;erve. In tho&s;e probabilities of chance and cau&s;es above-explain'd, 'tis the con&s;tancy of the union, which is dimi|ni&s;h'd; and in the probability deriv'd from analogy, 'tis the re&s;emblance only, which is affected. Without &s;ome degree of re&s;em|blance, as well as union, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible there can be any rea&s;oning: but as this re|&s;emblance admits of many different degrees, the rea&s;oning becomes proportionably more or le&s;s firm and certain. An experiment lo&s;es of its force, when transferr'd to in|&s;tances, which are not exactly re&s;embling; tho' 'tis evident it may &s;till retain as much as may be the foundation of probability, as long as there is any re&s;emblance remaining.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. <HI>Of unphilo&s;ophical probability.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the&s;e kinds of probability are receiv'd by philo&s;ophers, and al|low'd to be rea&s;onable foundations of belief and opinion. But there are others, that are deriv'd from the &s;ame principles, tho' they have not had the good fortune to obtain the &s;ame &s;anction. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> probability of this kind may be accounted for thus. The di|minution of the union, and of the re&s;em|blance, as above explained, dimini&s;hes the facility of the tran&s;ition, and by that means weakens the evidence; and we may farther ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame diminution of the evidence will follow from a diminution of the impre&s;&s;ion, and from the &s;hading of tho&s;e colours, under which it appears to the memory or &s;en&s;es. The argument, which we found on any matter of fact we remem|ber, is more or le&s;s convincing, according as the fact is recent or remote; and tho' the difference in the&s;e degrees of evidence be not receiv'd by philo&s;ophy as &s;olid and legitimate; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e an argument
<PB N="253" REF="264">
mu&s;t have a different force to day, from what it &s;hall have a month hence; yet not|with&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of philo&s;ophy, 'tis certain, this circum&s;tance has a con&s;i|derable influence on the under&s;tanding, and &s;ecretly changes the authority of the &s;ame argument, according to the different times, in which it is propos'd to us. A greater force and vivacity in the impre&s;&s;ion natural|ly conveys a greater to the related idea; and 'tis on the degrees of force and vivaci|ty, that the belief depends, according to the foregoing &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>&s;econd</HI> difference, which we may frequently ob&s;erve in our degrees of belief and a&s;&s;urance, and which never fails to take place, tho' di&s;claim'd by philo&s;ophers. An experiment, that is recent and fre&s;h in the memory, affects us more than one that is in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliterated; and has a &s;uperior influence on the judgment, as well as on the pa&s;&s;ions. A lively impre&s;&s;ion pro|duces more a&s;&s;urance than a faint one; be|cau&s;e it has more original force to commu|nicate to the related idea, which thereby acquires a greater force and vivacity. A recent ob&s;ervation has a like effect; be|cau&s;e the cu&s;tom and tran&s;ition is there more entire, and pre&s;erves better the origi|nal
<PB N="254" REF="265">
force in the communication. Thus a drunkard, who has &s;een his companion die of a debauch, is &s;truck with that in&s;tance for &s;ome time, and dreads a like accident for him&s;elf: But as the memory of it de|cays away by degrees, his former &s;ecurity returns, and the danger &s;eems le&s;s certain and real.</P>
<P>I ADD, as a <HI>third</HI> in&s;tance of this kind, that tho' our rea&s;onings from proofs and from probabilities be con&s;iderably different from each other, yet the former &s;pecies of rea&s;oning often degenerates in&s;en&s;ibly into the latter, by nothing but the multitude of connected ar|guments. 'Tis certain, that when an infe|rence is drawn immediately from an object, without any intermediate cau&s;e or effect, the conviction is much &s;tronger, and the per|&s;ua&s;ion more lively, than when the imagi|nation is carry'd thro' a long chain of con|nected arguments, however infallible the connexion of each link may be e&s;teem'd. 'Tis from the original impre&s;&s;ion, that the vivacity of all the ideas is deriv'd, by means of the cu&s;tomary tran&s;ition of the imagina|tion; and 'tis evident this vivacity mu&s;t gra|dually decay in proportion to the di&s;tance, and mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;omewhat in each tran&s;ition. Sometimes this di&s;tance has a greater influ|ence
<PB N="255" REF="266">
than even contrary experiments wou'd have; and a man may receive a more lively conviction from a probable rea&s;oning, which is clo&s;e and immediate, than from a long chain of con&s;equences, tho' ju&s;t and con|clu&s;ive in each part. Nay 'tis &s;eldom &s;uch rea&s;onings produce any conviction; and one mu&s;t have a very &s;trong and firm ima|gination to pre&s;erve the evidence to the end, where it pa&s;&s;es thro' &s;o many &s;tages.</P>
<P>BUT here it may not be ami&s;s to re|mark a very curious phaenomenon, which the pre&s;ent &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts to us. 'Tis e|vident there is no point of ancient hi&s;tory, of which we can have any a&s;&s;urance, but by pa&s;&s;ing thro' many millions of cau&s;es and effects, and thro' a chain of arguments of almo&s;t an immea&s;urable length. Before the knowledge of the fact cou'd come to the fir&s;t hi&s;torian, it mu&s;t be convey'd thro' many mouths; and after it is committed to writing, each new copy is a new object, of which the connexion with the foregoing is known only by experience and ob&s;ervation. Perhaps, therefore, it may be concluded from the precedent rea&s;oning, that the evidence of all ancient hi&s;tory mu&s;t now be lo&s;t; or at lea&s;t, will be lo&s;t in time, as the chain of cau&s;es encrea&s;es, and runs on to a greater length.
<PB N="256" REF="267" MS="y">
But as it &s;eems contrary to common &s;en&s;e to think, that if the republic of letters, and the art of printing continue on the &s;ame footing as at pre&s;ent, our po&s;terity, even af|ter a thou&s;and ages, can ever doubt if there has been &s;uch a man as JULIUS CAESAR; this may be con&s;ider'd as an objection to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. If belief con&s;i&s;ted only in a certain vivacity, convey'd from an ori|ginal impre&s;&s;ion, it wou'd decay by the length of the tran&s;ition, and mu&s;t at la&s;t be utterly extingui&s;h'd: And <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if belief on &s;ome occa&s;ions be not capable of &s;uch an extinction; it mu&s;t be &s;omething different from that vivacity.</P>
<P>BEFORE I an&s;wer this objection I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that from this topic there has been borrow'd a very celebrated argument again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> but with this differ|ence, that the connexion betwixt each link of the chain in human evidence has been there &s;uppos'd not to go beyond probability, and to be liable to a degree of doubt and un|certainty. And indeed it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that in this manner of con&s;idering the &s;ub|ject, (which however is not a true one) there is no hi&s;tory or tradition, but what mu&s;t in the end lo&s;e all its force and evidence. Eve|ry new probability dimini&s;hes the original
<PB N="257" REF="268">
conviction; and however great that convic|tion may be &s;uppos'd, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t under &s;uch re-iterated diminutions. This is true in general; tho' we &s;hall find <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part. IV. Sect. 1.</NOTE> afterwards, that there is one very me|morable exception, which is of va&s;t con&s;e|quence in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of the under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>MEAN while to give a &s;olution of the preceding objection upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that hi&s;torical evidence amounts at fir&s;t to an entire proof; let us con&s;ider, that tho' the links are innumerable, that connect any original fact with the pre&s;ent impre&s;|&s;ion, which is the foundation of belief; yet they are all of the &s;ame kind, and depend on the fidelity of Printers and Copi&s;ts. One edition pa&s;&s;es into another, and that into a third, and &s;o on, till we come to that vo|lume we peru&s;e at pre&s;ent. There is no va|riation in the &s;teps. After we know one, we know all of them; and after we have made one, we can have no &s;cruple as to the re&s;t. This circum&s;tance alone pre&s;erves the evi|dence of hi&s;tory, and will perpetuate the memory of the pre&s;ent age to the late&s;t po|&s;terity. If all the long chain of cau&s;es and effects, which connect any pa&s;t event with
<PB N="258" REF="269">
any volume of hi&s;tory, were compos'd of parts different from each other, and which 'twere nece&s;&s;ary for the mind di&s;tinctly to conceive, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hou'd pre&s;erve to the end any belief or evidence. But as mo&s;t of the&s;e proofs are perfectly re&s;embling, the mind runs ea&s;ily along them, jumps from one part to another with facility, and forms but a confus'd and general notion of each link. By this means a long chain of argu|ment, has as little effect in dimini&s;hing the original vivacity, as a much &s;horter wou'd have, if compos'd of parts, which were dif|ferent from each other, and of which each requir'd a di&s;tinct con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>A FOURTH unphilo&s;ophical &s;pecies of probability is that deriv'd from <HI>general rules,</HI> which we ra&s;hly form to our&s;elves, and which are the &s;ource of what we properly call PREJUDICE. An <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> cannot have wit, and a <HI>Frenchman</HI> cannot have &s;o|lidity; for which rea&s;on, tho' the conver&s;a|tion of the former in any in&s;tance be vi&s;ibly very agreeable, and of the latter very judi|cious, we have entertain'd &s;uch a prejudice a|gain&s;t them, that they mu&s;t be dunces or fops in &s;pite of &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on. Human nature is very &s;ubject to errors of this kind; and perhaps this nation as much as any o|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="270">
SHOU'D it be demanded why men form general rules, and allow them to in|fluence their judgment, even contrary to pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation and experience, I &s;hou'd reply, that in my opinion it proceeds from tho&s;e very principles, on which all judgments concerning cau&s;es and effects de|pend. Our judgments concerning cau&s;e and effect are deriv'd from habit and experience; and when we have been accu&s;tom'd to &s;ee one object united to another, our imagina|tion pa&s;&s;es from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd, by a natural tran&s;ition, which precedes reflection, and which cannot be prevented by it. Now 'tis the nature of cu&s;tom not only to operate with its full force, when objects are pre|&s;ented, that are exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e to which we have been accu&s;tom'd; but al&s;o to operate in an inferior degree, when we di&s;|cover &s;uch as are &s;imilar; and tho' the ha|bit lo&s;es &s;omewhat of its force by every dif|ference, yet 'tis &s;eldom entirely de&s;troy'd, where any con&s;iderable circum&s;tances re|main the &s;ame. A man, who has contract|ed a cu&s;tom of eating fruit by the u&s;e of pears or peaches, will &s;atisfy him&s;elf with melons, where he cannot find his favourite fruit; as one, who has become a drunkard by the u&s;e of red wines, will be carried al|mo&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="271">
with the &s;ame violence to white, if pre&s;ented to him. From this principle I have accounted for that &s;pecies of probabi|lity, deriv'd from analogy, where we tran&s;|fer our experience in pa&s;t in&s;tances to ob|jects which are re&s;embling, but are not ex|actly the &s;ame with tho&s;e concerning which we have had experience. In proportion as the re&s;emblance decays, the probability di|mini&s;hes; but &s;till has &s;ome force as long as there remain any traces of the re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation we may carry farther; and may remark, that tho' cu&s;tom be the foundation of all our judgments, yet &s;ome|times it has an effect on the imagination in oppo&s;ition to the judgment, and produces a contrariety in our &s;entiments concerning the &s;ame object. I explain my&s;elf. In almo&s;t all kinds of cau&s;es there is a complication of circum&s;tances, of which &s;ome are e&s;&s;en|tial, and others &s;uperfluous; &s;ome are ab&s;o|lutely requi&s;ite to the production of the ef|fect, and others are only conjoin'd by acci|dent. Now we may ob&s;erve, that when the&s;e &s;uperfluous circum&s;tances are nume|rous, and remarkable, and frequently con|join'd with the e&s;&s;ential, they have &s;uch an influence on the imagination, that even in the ab&s;ence of the latter they carry us on
<PB N="261" REF="272">
to the conception of the u&s;ual effect, and give to that conception a force and vivacity, which make it &s;uperior to the mere fic|tions of the fancy. We may correct this propen&s;ity by a reflection on the nature of tho&s;e circum&s;tances; but 'tis &s;till certain, that cu&s;tom takes the &s;tart, and gives a bia&s;s to the imagination.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this by a familiar in&s;tance, let us con&s;ider the ca&s;e of a man, who be|ing hung out from a high tower in a cage of iron cannot forbear trembling, when he &s;ur|veys the precipice below him, tho' he knows him&s;elf to be perfectly &s;ecure from falling, by his experience of the &s;olidity of the iron, which &s;upports him; and tho' the ideas of fall and de&s;cent, and harm and death, be deriv'd &s;olely from cu&s;tom and experience. The &s;ame cu&s;tom goes beyond the in&s;tances, from which it is deriv'd, and to which it perfectly corre&s;ponds; and influences his ideas of &s;uch objects as are in &s;ome re&s;pect re&s;embling, but fall not preci&s;ely under the &s;ame rule. The circum&s;tances of depth and de&s;cent &s;trike &s;o &s;trongly upon him, that their influence cannot be de&s;troy'd by the contrary circum&s;tances of &s;upport and &s;oli|dity, which ought to give him a perfect &s;e|curity. His imagination runs away with
<PB N="262" REF="273">
its object, and excites a pa&s;&s;ion proportion'd to it. That pa&s;&s;ion returns back upon the imagination and inlivens the idea; which lively idea has a new influence on the pa&s;|&s;ion, and in its turn augments its force and violence; and both his fancy and affections, thus mutually &s;upporting each other, cau&s;e the whole to have a very great influence upon him.</P>
<P>BUT why need we &s;eek for other in|&s;tances, while the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of philo|&s;ophical probabilities offers us &s;o obvious an one, in the oppo&s;ition betwixt the judgment and imagination ari&s;ing from the&s;e effects of cu&s;tom? According to my &s;y&s;tem, all rea|&s;onings are nothing but the effects of cu&s;|tom; and cu&s;tom has no influence, but by inlivening the imagination, and giving us a &s;trong conception of any object. It may, therefore, be concluded, that our judgment and imagination can never be contrary, and that cu&s;tom cannot operate on the latter faculty after &s;uch a manner, as to render it oppo&s;ite to the former. This difficulty we can remove after no other manner, than by &s;uppo&s;ing the influence of general rules. We &s;hall afterwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 15.</NOTE> take notice of &s;ome ge|neral rules, by which we ought to regulate
<PB N="263" REF="274">
our judgment concerning cau&s;es and effects; and the&s;e rules are form'd on the nature of our under&s;tanding, and on our experience of its operations in the judgments we form concerning objects. By them we learn to di&s;tingui&s;h the accidental circum&s;tances from the efficacious cau&s;es; and when we find that an effect can be produc'd without the concurrence of any particular circum&s;tance, we conclude that that circum&s;tance makes not a part of the efficacious cau&s;e, however frequently conjoin'd with it. But as this frequent conjunction nece&s;&s;arily makes it have &s;ome effect on the imagination, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion from general rules, the oppo&s;ition of the&s;e two principles produces a contrariety in our thoughts, and cau&s;es us to a&s;cribe the one inference to our judgment, and the other to our imagina|tion. The general rule is attributed to our judgment; as being more exten&s;ive and con|&s;tant. The exception to the imagination; as being more capricious and uncertain.</P>
<P>THUS our general rules are in a manner &s;et in oppo&s;ition to each other. When an object appears, that re&s;embles any cau&s;e in very con&s;iderable circum&s;tances, the imagi|nation naturally carries us to a lively con|ception of the u&s;ual effect, tho' the object
<PB N="264" REF="275">
be different in the mo&s;t material and mo&s;t efficacious circum&s;tances from that cau&s;e. Here is the fir&s;t influence of general rules. But when we take a review of this act of the mind, and compare it with the more ge|neral and authentic operations of the under|&s;tanding, we find it to be of an irregular na|ture, and de&s;tructive of all the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd principles of rea&s;onings; which is the cau&s;e of our rejecting it. This is a &s;econd influ|ence of general rules, and implies the con|demnation of the former. Sometimes the one, &s;ometimes the other prevails, accord|ing to the di&s;po&s;ition and character of the per&s;on. The vulgar are commonly guided by the fir&s;t, and wi&s;e men by the &s;econd. Mean while the &s;ceptics may here have the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving a new and &s;ignal con|tradiction in our rea&s;on, and of &s;eeing all philo&s;ophy ready to be &s;ubverted by a prin|ciple of human nature, and again &s;av'd by a new direction of the very &s;ame principle. The following of general rules is a very un|philo&s;ophical &s;pecies of probability; and yet 'tis only by following them that we can cor|rect this, and all other unphilo&s;ophical pro|babilities.</P>
<P>SINCE we have in&s;tances, where gene|ral rules operate on the imagination even
<PB N="265" REF="276">
contrary to the judgment, we need not be &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee their effects encrea&s;e, when conjoin'd with that latter faculty, and to ob&s;erve that they be&s;tow on the ideas they pre&s;ent to us a force &s;uperior to what at|tends any other. Every one knows, there is an indirect manner of in&s;inuating prai&s;e or blame, which is much le&s;s &s;hocking than the open flattery or cen&s;ure of any per&s;on. However he may communicate his &s;enti|ments by &s;uch &s;ecret in&s;inuations, and make them known with equal certainty as by the open di&s;covery of them, 'tis certain that their influence is not equally &s;trong and powerful. One who la&s;hes me with con|ceal'd &s;trokes of &s;atire, moves not my indig|nation to &s;uch a degree, as if he flatly told me I was a fool and coxcomb; tho' I e|qually under&s;tand his meaning, as if he did. This difference is to be attributed to the in|fluence of general rules.</P>
<P>WHETHER a per&s;on openly abu&s;es me, or &s;lyly intimates his contempt, in neither ca&s;e do I immediately perceive his &s;entiment or opinion; and 'tis only by &s;igns, that is, by its effects, I become &s;en&s;ible of it. The only difference, then, betwixt the&s;e two ca&s;es con&s;i&s;ts in this, that in the open di&s;co|very of his &s;entiments he makes u&s;e of &s;igns,
<PB N="266" REF="277">
which are general and univer&s;al; and in the &s;ecret intimation employs &s;uch as are more &s;ingular and uncommon. The effect of this circum&s;tance is, that the imagination, in running from the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion to the ab&s;ent idea, makes the tran&s;ition with greater facility, and con&s;equently conceives the ob|ject with greater force, where the connexion is common and univer&s;al, than where it is more rare and particular. Accordingly we may ob&s;erve, that the open declaration of our &s;entiments is call'd the taking off the ma&s;k, as the &s;ecret intimation of our opi|nions is &s;aid to be the veiling of them. The difference betwixt an idea produc'd by a general connexion, and that ari&s;ing from a particular one is here compar'd to the dif|ference betwixt an impre&s;&s;ion and an idea. This difference in the imagination has a &s;uitable effect on the pa&s;&s;ions; and this ef|fect is augmented by another circum&s;tance. A &s;ecret intimation of anger or contempt &s;hews that we &s;till have &s;ome con&s;ideration for the per&s;on, and avoid the directly a|bu&s;ing him. This makes a conceal'd &s;atire le&s;s di&s;agreeable; but &s;till this depends on the &s;ame principle. For if an idea were not more feeble, when only intimated, it wou'd never be e&s;teem'd a mark of greater
<PB N="267" REF="278">
re&s;pect to proceed in this method than in the other.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES &s;currility is le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing than delicate &s;atire, becau&s;e it revenges us in a manner for the injury at the very time it is committed, by affording us a ju&s;t rea|&s;on to blame and contemn the per&s;on, who injures us. But this phaenomenon likewi&s;e depends upon the &s;ame principle. For why do we blame all gro&s;s and injurious language, unle&s;s it be, becau&s;e we e&s;teem it contrary to good breeding and humanity? And why is it contrary, unle&s;s it be more &s;hocking than any delicate &s;atire? The rules of good|breeding condemn whatever is openly di&s;|obliging, and gives a &s;en&s;ible pain and con|fu&s;ion to tho&s;e, with whom we conver&s;e. After this is once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, abu&s;ive lan|guage is univer&s;ally blam'd, and gives le&s;s pain upon account of its coar&s;ene&s;s and in|civility, which render the per&s;on de&s;picable, that employs it. It becomes le&s;s di&s;agree|able, merely becau&s;e originally it is more &s;o; and 'tis more di&s;agreeable, becau&s;e it affords an inference by general and common rules, that are palpable and undeniable.</P>
<P>TO this explication of the different in|fluence of open and conceal'd flattery or &s;atire, I &s;hall add the con&s;ideration of ano|ther
<PB N="268" REF="279">
phaenomenon, which is analogous to it. There are many particulars in the point of honour both of men and women, who&s;e violations, when open and avow'd, the world never excu&s;es, but which it is more apt to overlook, when the appearances are &s;av'd, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is &s;ecret and conceal'd. Even tho&s;e, who know with equal certainty, that the fault is committed, pardon it more ea&s;ily, when the proofs &s;eem in &s;ome mea|&s;ure oblique and equivocal, than when they are direct and undeniable. The &s;ame idea is pre&s;ented in both ca&s;es, and, properly &s;peaking, is equally a&s;&s;ented to by the judg|ment; and yet its influence is different, be|cau&s;e of the different manner, in which it is pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Now if we compare the&s;e two ca&s;es, of the <HI>open</HI> and <HI>conceal'd</HI> violations of the laws of honour, we &s;hall find, that the difference betwixt them con&s;i&s;ts in this, that in the fir&s;t ca&s;e the &s;ign, from which we infer the blameable action, is &s;ingle, and &s;uffices a|lone to be the foundation of our rea&s;oning and judgment; whereas in the latter the &s;igns are numerous, and decide little or no|thing when alone and unaccompany'd with many minute circum&s;tances, which are al|mo&s;t imperceptible. But 'tis certainly true,
<PB N="269" REF="280">
that any rea&s;oning is always the more con|vincing, the more &s;ingle and united it is to the eye, and the le&s;s exerci&s;e it gives to the imagination to collect all its parts, and run from them to the correlative idea, which forms the conclu&s;ion. The labour of the thought di&s;turbs the regular progre&s;s of the &s;entiments, as we &s;hall ob&s;erve pre&s;ently <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part IV. Sect. 1.</NOTE>. The idea &s;trikes not on us with &s;uch viva|city; and con&s;equently has no &s;uch influ|ence on the pa&s;&s;ion and imagination.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principles we may ac|count for tho&s;e ob&s;ervations of the CAR|DINAL DE RETZ, <HI>that there are many things, in which the world wi&s;hes to be de|ceiv'd;</HI> and <HI>that it more ea&s;ily excu&s;es a per|&s;on in acting than in talking contrary to the decorum of his profe&s;&s;ion and character.</HI> A fault in words is commonly more open and di&s;tinct than one in actions, which admit of many palliating excu&s;es, and decide not &s;o clearly concerning the intention and views of the actor.</P>
<P>THUS it appears upon the whole, that every kind of opinion or judgment, which amounts not to knowledge, is deriv'd en|tirely from the force and vivacity of the perception, and that the&s;e qualities con&s;ti|tute
<PB N="270" REF="281">
in the mind, what we call the BELIEF of the exi&s;tence of any object. This force and this vivacity are mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the memory; and therefore our confidence in the veracity of that faculty is the greate&s;t imaginable, and equals in many re&s;pects the a&s;&s;urance of a demon&s;tration. The next de|gree of the&s;e qualities is that deriv'd from the relation of cau&s;e and effect; and this too is very great, e&s;pecially when the conjunc|tion is found by experience to be perfectly con&s;tant, and when the object, which is pre&s;ent to us, exactly re&s;embles tho&s;e, of which we have had experience. But below this degree of evidence there are many o|thers, which have an influence on the pa&s;|&s;ions and imagination, proportion'd to that degree of force and vivacity, which they communicate to the ideas. 'Tis by habit we make the tran&s;ition from cau&s;e to effect; and 'tis from &s;ome pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion we borrow that vivacity, which we diffu&s;e over the correlative idea. But when we have not ob&s;erv'd a &s;ufficient number of in&s;tances, to produce a &s;trong habit; or when the&s;e in|&s;tances are contrary to each other; or when the re&s;emblance is not exact; or the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion is faint and ob&s;cure; or the ex|perience in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliterated from
<PB N="271" REF="282">
the memory; or the connexion dependent on a long chain of objects; or the inference deriv'd from general rules, and yet not con|formable to them: In all the&s;e ca&s;es the evi|dence dimini&s;hes by the diminution of the force and inten&s;ene&s;s of the idea. This therefore is the nature of the judgment and probability.</P>
<P>WHAT principally gives authority to this &s;y&s;tem is, be&s;ide the undoubted arguments, upon which each part is founded, the agree|ment of the&s;e parts, and the nece&s;&s;ity of one to explain another. The belief, which attends our memory, is of the &s;ame nature with that, which is deriv'd from our judg|ments: Nor is there any difference betwixt that judgment, which is deriv'd from a con|&s;tant and uniform connexion of cau&s;es and effects, and that which depends upon an in|terrupted and uncertain. 'Tis indeed evi|dent, that in all determinations, where the mind decides from contrary experiments, 'tis fir&s;t divided within it&s;elf, and has an inclination to either &s;ide in proportion to the number of experiments we have &s;een and remember. This conte&s;t is at la&s;t determin'd to the advantage of that &s;ide, where we ob|&s;erve a &s;uperior number of the&s;e experi|ments; but &s;till with a diminution of force
<PB N="272" REF="283">
in the evidence corre&s;pondent to the number of the oppo&s;ite experiments. Each po&s;&s;ibi|lity, of which the probability is compos'd, operates &s;eparately upon the imagination; and 'tis the larger collection of po&s;&s;ibilities, which at la&s;t prevails, and that with a force propor|tionable to its &s;uperiority. All the&s;e phaeno|mena lead directly to the precedent &s;y&s;tem; nor will it ever be po&s;&s;ible upon any other principles to give a &s;atisfactory and con&s;i&s;tent explication of them. Without con&s;idering the&s;e judgments as the effects of cu&s;tom on the imagination, we &s;hall lo&s;e our&s;elves in perpetual contradiction and ab&s;urdity.</P>

<P>HAVING thus explain'd the manner, <HI>in which we rea&s;on beyond our imme|diate impre&s;&s;ions, and conclude that &s;uch par|ticular cau&s;es mu&s;t have &s;uch particular ef|fects;</HI> we mu&s;t now return upon our foot|&s;teps to examine that que&s;tion, which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 2.</NOTE> fir&s;t occur'd to us, and which we dropt in our way, <HI>viz. What is our idea of nece&s;&s;ity, when we &s;ay that two objects are nece&s;&s;arily</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="284">
<HI>connected together.</HI> Upon this head I repeat what I have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that as we have no idea, that is not deriv'd from an impre&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t find &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion, that gives ri&s;e to this idea of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, if we a&s;&s;ert we have really &s;uch an idea. In order to this I con&s;ider, in what objects nece&s;&s;ity is commonly &s;uppos'd to lie; and finding that it is always a&s;crib'd to cau&s;es and effects, I turn my eye to two objects &s;uppos'd to be plac'd in that relation; and examine them in all the &s;ituations, of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible. I immediately perceive, that they are <HI>contiguous</HI> in time and place, and that the object we call cau&s;e <HI>precedes</HI> the other we call effect. In no one in&s;tance can I go any farther, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for me to di&s;cover any third relation betwixt the&s;e objects. I therefore enlarge my view to comprehend &s;everal in&s;tance; where I find like objects always exi&s;ting in like relations of contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. At fir&s;t &s;ight this &s;eems to &s;erve but little to my purpo&s;e. The reflection on &s;everal in&s;tances only repeats the &s;ame objects; and there|fore can never give ri&s;e to a new idea. But upon farther enquiry I find, that the repe|tition is not in every particular the &s;ame, but produces a new impre&s;&s;ion, and by that
<PB N="274" REF="285">
means the idea, which I at pre&s;ent examine. For after a frequent repetition, I find, that upon the appearance of one of the objects, the mind is <HI>determin'd</HI> by cu&s;tom to con|&s;ider its u&s;ual attendant, and to con&s;ider it in a &s;tronger light upon account of its re|lation to the fir&s;t object. 'Tis this impre&s;|&s;ion, then, or <HI>determination,</HI> which affords me the idea of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not but the&s;e con&s;equences will at fir&s;t &s;ight be receiv'd without diffi|culty, as being evident deductions from prin|ciples, which we have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and which we have often employ'd in our rea&s;onings. This evidence both in the fir&s;t principles, and in the deductions, may &s;e|duce us unwarily into the conclu&s;ion, and make us imagine it contains nothing extra|ordinary, nor worthy of our curio&s;ity. But tho' &s;uch an inadvertence may facilitate the reception of this rea&s;oning, 'twill make it be the more ea&s;ily forgot; for which rea&s;on I think it proper to give warning, that I have ju&s;t now examin'd one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime que&s;tions in philo&s;ophy, <HI>viz. that concerning the power and efficacy of cau&s;es;</HI> where all the &s;ciences &s;eem &s;o much inte|re&s;ted. Such a warning will naturally rouze up the attention of the reader, and make
<PB N="275" REF="286">
him de&s;ire a more full account of my doc|trine, as well as of the arguments, on which it is founded. This reque&s;t is &s;o rea&s;onable, that I cannot refu&s;e complying with it; e&s;|pecially as I am hopeful that the&s;e princi|ples, the more they are examin'd, will ac|quire the more force and evidence.</P>
<P>THERE is no que&s;tion, which on account of its importance, as well as difficulty, has caus'd more di&s;putes both among antient and modern philo&s;ophers, than this concerning the efficacy of cau&s;es, or that quality which makes them be follow'd by their effects. But before they enter'd upon the&s;e di&s;putes, methinks it wou'd not have been improper to have examin'd what idea we have of that efficacy, which is the &s;ubject of the con|trover&s;y. This is what I find principally wanting in their rea&s;onings, and what I &s;hall here endeavour to &s;upply.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with ob&s;erving that the terms of <HI>efficacy, agency, power, force, energy, ne|ce&s;&s;ity, connexion,</HI> and <HI>productive quality,</HI> are all nearly &s;ynonimous; and therefore 'tis an ab&s;urdity to employ any of them in de|fining the re&s;t. By this ob&s;ervation we re|ject at once all the vulgar definitions, which philo&s;ophers have given of power and effi|cacy; and in&s;tead of &s;earching for the idea
<PB N="276" REF="287">
in the&s;e definitions, mu&s;t look for it in the impre&s;&s;ions, from which it is originally de|riv'd. If it be a compound idea, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from compound impre&s;&s;ions. If &s;imple, from &s;imple impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE the mo&s;t general and mo&s;t popular explication of this matter, is to &s;ay, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Locke;</HI> chapter of power.</NOTE> that finding from experience, that there are &s;everal new productions in matter, &s;uch as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there mu&s;t &s;omewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at la&s;t by this rea&s;oning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinc'd that this explication is more popular than philo&s;ophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That rea&s;on alone can never give ri&s;e to any original idea, and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that rea&s;on, as di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cau&s;e or productive qua|lity is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to every beginning of exi&s;tence. Both the&s;e con&s;iderations have been &s;ufficiently explain'd; and therefore &s;hall not at pre&s;ent be any farther in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>I SHALL only infer from them, that &s;ince rea&s;on can never give ri&s;e to the idea of efficacy, that idea mu&s;t be deriv'd from expe|rience, and from &s;ome particular in&s;tances of
<PB N="277" REF="288">
this efficacy, which make their pa&s;&s;age into the mind by the common channels of &s;en|&s;ation or reflection. Ideas always repre&s;ent their objects or impre&s;&s;ions; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> there are &s;ome objects nece&s;&s;ary to give ri&s;e to every idea. If we pretend, therefore, to have any ju&s;t idea of this efficacy, we mu&s;t produce &s;ome in&s;tance, wherein the efficacy is plainly di&s;coverable to the mind, and its operations obvious to our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or &s;en&s;ation. By the refu&s;al of this, we ac|knowledge, that the idea is impo&s;&s;ible and imaginary; &s;ince the principle of innate ideas, which alone can &s;ave us from this dilemma, has been already refuted, and is now al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally rejected in the learned world. Our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, then, mu&s;t be to find &s;ome natural production, where the operation and efficacy of a cau&s;e can be clear|ly conceiv'd and comprehended by the mind, without any danger of ob&s;curity or mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IN this re&s;earch we meet with very little encouragement from that prodigious diver|&s;ity, which is found in the opinions of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who have pretended to explain the &s;ecret force and energy of cau&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Father <HI>Malbranche,</HI> Book vi. Part 2. chap. 3. and the illu&s;trations upon it.</NOTE>. There are &s;ome, who maintain, that bodies operate
<PB N="278" REF="289">
by their &s;ub&s;tantial form; others, by their accidents or qualities; &s;everal, by their matter and form; &s;ome, by their form and accidents; others, by certain virtues and fa|culties di&s;tinct from all this. All the&s;e &s;en|timents again are mix'd and vary'd in a thou&s;and different ways; and form a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that none of them have any &s;olidity or evidence, and that the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of an efficacy in any of the known qualities of matter is entirely without foun|dation. This pre&s;umption mu&s;t encrea&s;e upon us, when we con&s;ider, that the&s;e prin|ciples of &s;ub&s;tantial forms, and accidents, and faculties, are not in reality any of the known properties of bodies, but are perfectly unintelligible and inexplicable. For 'tis evi|dent philo&s;ophers wou'd never have had recour&s;e to &s;uch ob&s;cure and uncertian principles had they met with any &s;a|tisfaction in &s;uch as are clear and intelli|gible; e&s;pecially in &s;uch an affair as this, which mu&s;t be an object of the &s;imple&s;t un|der&s;tanding, if not of the &s;en&s;es. Upon the whole, we may conclude, that 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible in any one in&s;tance to &s;hew the prin|ciple, in which the force and agency of a cau&s;e is plac'd; and that the mo&s;t refin'd and mo&s;t vulgar under&s;tandings are equally
<PB N="279" REF="290">
at a lo&s;s in this particular. If any one think proper to refute this a&s;&s;ertion, he need not put him&s;elf to the trouble of inventing any long rea&s;onings; but may at once &s;hew us an in&s;tance of a cau&s;e, where we di&s;|cover the power or operating principle. This defiance we are oblig'd frequently to make u&s;e of, as being almo&s;t the only means of proving a negative in philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, which has been met with in all the attempts to fix this power, has at la&s;t oblig'd philo&s;ophers to conclude, that the ultimate force and efficacy of na|ture is perfectly unknown to us, and that 'tis in vain we &s;earch for it in all the known qualities of matter. In this opinion they are almo&s;t unanimous; and 'tis only in the inference they draw from it, that they di&s;|cover any difference in their &s;entiments. For &s;ome of them, as the <HI>Carte&s;ians</HI> in particular, having e&s;tabli&s;h'd it as a principle, that we are perfectly acquainted with the e&s;&s;ence of mat|ter, have very naturally inferr'd, that it is en|dow'd with no efficacy, and that 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible for it of it&s;elf to communicate motion, or produce any of tho&s;e effects, which we a&s;cribe to it. As the e&s;&s;ence of matter con|&s;i&s;ts in exten&s;ion, and as exten&s;ion implies not actual motion, but only mobility; they
<PB N="280" REF="291">
conclude, that the energy, which produces the motion, cannot lie in the exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS conclu&s;ion leads them into another, which they regard as perfectly unavoidable. Matter, &s;ay they, is in it&s;elf entirely unac|tive, and depriv'd of any power, by which it may produce, or continue, or communicate motion: But &s;ince the&s;e effects are evident to our &s;en&s;es, and &s;ince the power, that pro|duces them, mu&s;t be plac'd &s;omewhere, it mu&s;t lie in the DEITY, or that divine be|ing, who contains in his nature all excel|lency and perfection. 'Tis the deity, there|fore, who is the prime mover of the uni|ver&s;e, and who not only fir&s;t created mat|ter, and gave it's original impul&s;e, but like|wi&s;e by a continu'd exertion of omnipo|tence, &s;upports its exi&s;tence, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively be&s;tows on it all tho&s;e motions, and confi|gurations, and qualities, with which it is endow'd.</P>
<P>THIS opinion is certainly very curious, and well worth our attention; but 'twill appear &s;uperfluous to examine it in this place, if we reflect a moment on our pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e in taking notice of it. We have e&s;tabli&s;h'd it as a principle, that as all ideas are deriv'd from impre&s;&s;ions, or &s;ome precedent <HI>perceptions,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can
<PB N="281" REF="292">
have any idea of power and efficacy, unle&s;s &s;ome in&s;tances can be produc'd, wherein this power <HI>is perceiv'd</HI> to exert it&s;elf. Now as the&s;e in&s;tances can never be di&s;cover'd in body, the <HI>Carte&s;ians,</HI> proceeding upon their principle of innate ideas, have had recour&s;e to a &s;upreme &s;pirit or deity, whom they con|&s;ider as the only active being in the univer&s;e, and as the immediate cau&s;e of every altera|tion in matter. But the principle of innate ideas being allow'd to be fal&s;e, it follows, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of a deity can &s;erve us in no &s;tead, in accounting for that idea of agency, which we &s;earch for in vain in all the objects, which are pre&s;ented to our &s;en&s;es, or which we are internally con&s;cious of in our own minds. For if every idea be deriv'd from an impre&s;&s;ion, the idea of a deity pro|ceeds from the &s;ame origin; and if no im|pre&s;&s;ion, either of &s;en&s;ation or reflection, im|plies any force or efficacy, 'tis equally im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover or even imagine any &s;uch active principle in the deity. Since the&s;e philo&s;ophers, therefore, have concluded, that matter cannot be endow'd with any effica|cious principle, becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover in it &s;uch a principle; the &s;ame cour&s;e of rea&s;oning &s;hou'd determine them to exclude it from the &s;upreme being. Or if
<PB N="282" REF="293" MS="y">
they e&s;tem that opinion ab&s;urd and impious, as it really is, I &s;hall tell them how they may avoid it; and that is, by concluding from the very fir&s;t, that they have no ade|quate idea of power or efficacy in any ob|ject; &s;ince neither in body nor &s;pirit, nei|ther in &s;uperior nor inferior natures, are they able to di&s;cover one &s;ingle in&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame conclu&s;ion is unavoidable up|on the hypothe&s;is of tho&s;e, who maintain the efficacy of &s;econd cau&s;es, and attribute a de|rivative, but a real power and energy to matter. For as they confe&s;s, that this ener|gy lies not in any of the known qualities of matter, the difficulty &s;till remains concern|ing the origin of its idea. If we have real|ly an idea of power, we may attribute power to an unknown quality: But as 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible, that that idea can be deriv'd from &s;uch a quality, and as there is nothing in known qualities, which can produce it; it follows that we deceive our&s;elves, when we imagine we are po&s;&s;e&s;t of any idea of this kind, after the manner we commonly under&s;tand it. All ideas are deriv'd from, and repre&s;ent impre&s;|&s;ions. We never have any impre&s;&s;ion, that contains any power or efficacy. We never therefore have any idea of power.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="294">
IT has been e&s;tabli&s;h'd as a certain principle, that general or ab&s;tract ideas are nothing but individual ones taken in a certain light, and that, in reflecting on any object, 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible to exclude from our thought all particular degrees of quantity and quality as from the real nature of things. If we be po&s;&s;e&s;t, therefore, of any idea of power in general, we mu&s;t al&s;o be able to conceive &s;ome particular &s;pecies of it; and as power cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, but is always regarded as an attribute of &s;ome being or exi&s;tence, we mu&s;t be able to place this power in &s;ome particular being, and conceive that being as endow'd with a real force and energy, by which &s;uch a particular effect nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ults from its operation. We mu&s;t di&s;tinct|ly and particularly conceive the connexion betwixt the cau&s;e and effect, and be able to pronounce, from a &s;imple view of the one, that it mu&s;t be follow'd or preceded by the other. This is the true manner of con|ceiving a particular power in a particular body: and a general idea being impo&s;&s;ible without an individual; where the latter is impo&s;&s;ible, 'tis certain the former can never exi&s;t. Now nothing is more evident, than that the human mind cannot form &s;uch an idea of two objects, as to conceive any con|nexion
<PB N="284" REF="295">
betwixt them, or comprehend di|&s;tinctly that power or efficacy, by which they are united. Such a connexion wou'd amount to a demon&s;tration, and wou'd im|ply the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility for the one ob|ject not to follow, or to be conceiv'd not to follow upon the other: Which kind of connexion has already been rejected in all ca&s;es. If any one is of a contrary opinion, and thinks he has attain'd a notion of power in any particular object, I de&s;ire he may point out to me that object. But till I meet with &s;uch-a-one, which I de&s;pair of, I can|not forbear concluding, that &s;ince we can never di&s;tinctly conceive how any particu|lar power can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ide in any parti|cular object, we deceive our&s;elves in ima|gining we can form any &s;uch general idea.</P>
<P>THUS upon the whole we may infer, that when we talk of any being, whether of a &s;u|perior or inferior nature, as endow'd with a power or force, proportion'd to any effect; when we &s;peak of a nece&s;&s;ary connexion be|twixt objects, and &s;uppo&s;e, that this conne|xion depends upon an efficacy or energy, with which any of the&s;e objects are endow'd; in all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>&s;o apply'd,</HI> we have really no di&s;tinct meaning, and make u&s;e
<PB N="285" REF="296">
only of common words, without any clear and determinate ideas. But as 'tis more pro|bable, that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions do here lo&s;e their true meaning by being <HI>wrong apply'd,</HI> than that they never have any meaning; 'twill be proper to be&s;tow another con|&s;ideration on this &s;ubject, to &s;ee if po&s;&s;ibly we can di&s;cover the nature and origin of tho&s;e ideas, we annex to them.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE two objects to be pre&s;ented to us, of which the one is the cau&s;e and the other the effect; 'tis plain, that from the &s;imple con&s;ideration of one, or both the&s;e objects we never &s;hall perceive the tie, by which they are united, or be able certainly to pronounce, that there is a connexion be|twixt them. 'Tis not, therefore, from any one in&s;tance, that we arrive at the idea of cau&s;e and effect, of a nece&s;&s;ary connexion of power, of force, of energy, and of effi|cacy. Did we never &s;ee any but particular conjunctions of objects, entirely different from each other, we &s;hou'd never be able to form any &s;uch ideas.</P>
<P>BUT again; &s;uppo&s;e we ob&s;erve &s;everal in|&s;tances, in which the &s;ame objects are always conjoin'd together, we immediately conceive a connexion betwixt them, and begin to draw an inference from one to another. This
<PB N="286" REF="297">
multiplicity of re&s;embling in&s;tances, there|fore, con&s;titutes the very e&s;&s;ence of power or connexion, and is the &s;ource, from which the idea of it ari&s;es. In order, then, to under&s;tand the idea of power, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider that multiplicity; nor do I a&s;k more to give a &s;olution of that difficulty, which has &s;o long perplex'd us. For thus I rea&s;on. The repetition of perfectly &s;imilar in&s;tances can never <HI>alone</HI> give ri&s;e to an original idea, different from what is to be found in any par|ticular in&s;tance, as has been ob&s;erv'd, and as evidently follows from our fundamental principle, <HI>that all ideas are copy'd from im|pre&s;&s;ions.</HI> Since therefore the idea of power is a new original idea, not to be found in any one in&s;tance, and which yet ari&s;es from the repetition of &s;everal in&s;tances, it follows, that the repetition <HI>alone</HI> has not that effect, but mu&s;t either <HI>di&s;cover</HI> or <HI>produce</HI> &s;ome|thing new, which is the &s;ource of that idea. Did the repetition neither di&s;cover nor pro|duce any thing new, our ideas might be multiply'd by it, but wou'd not be enlarg'd above what they are upon ob&s;ervation of one &s;ingle in&s;tance. Every enlargement, there|fore, (&s;uch as the idea of power or con|nexion) which ari&s;es from the multiplicity of &s;imilar in&s;tances, is copy'd from &s;ome
<PB N="287" REF="298">
effects of the multiplicity, and will be per|fectly under&s;tood by under&s;tanding the&s;e effects. Wherever we find any thing new to be di&s;cover'd or produc'd by the repeti|tion, there we mu&s;t place the power, and mu&s;t never look for it in any other object.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis evident, in the fir&s;t place, that the repetition of like objects in like relations of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and contiguity <HI>di&s;covers</HI> no|thing new in any one of them; &s;ince we can draw no inference from it, nor make it a &s;ub|ject either of our demon&s;trative or probable rea&s;onings;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 6.</NOTE> as has been already prov'd. Nay &s;uppo&s;e we cou'd draw an inference, 'twou'd be of no con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent cau&s;e; &s;ince no kind of rea&s;oning can give ri&s;e to a new idea, &s;uch as this of power is; but wherever we rea&s;on, we mu&s;t antece|dently be po&s;&s;e&s;t of clear ideas, which may be the objects of our rea&s;oning. The con|ception always precedes the under&s;tanding; and where the one is ob&s;cure, the other is uncertain; where the one fails, the other mu&s;t fail al&s;o.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, 'Tis certain that this repe|tition of &s;imilar objects in &s;imilar &s;ituations <HI>produces</HI> nothing new either in the&s;e objects, or in any external body. For 'twill readily be
<PB N="288" REF="299">
allow'd, that the &s;everal in&s;tances we have of the conjunction of re&s;embling cau&s;es and effects are in them&s;elves entirely indepen|dent, and that the communication of mo|tion, which I &s;ee re&s;ults at pre&s;ent from the &s;hock of two billiard-balls, is totally di&s;tinct from that which I &s;aw re&s;ult from &s;uch an impul&s;e a twelve-month ago. The&s;e im|pul&s;es have no influence on each other. They are entirely divided by time and place; and the one might have exi&s;ted and communi|cated motion, tho' the other never had been in being.</P>
<P>THERE is, then, nothing new either di&s;cover'd or produc'd in any objects by their con&s;tant conjunction, and by the uninter|rupted re&s;emblance of their relations of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion and contiguity. But 'tis from this re&s;emblance, that the ideas of nece&s;&s;ity, of power, and of efficacy, are deriv'd. The&s;e ideas, therefore, repre&s;ent not any thing, that does or can belong to the objects, which are con&s;tantly conjoin'd. This is an argu|ment, which, in every view we can examine it, will be found perfectly unan&s;werable. Similar in&s;tances are &s;till the fir&s;t &s;ource of our idea of power or nece&s;&s;ity; at the &s;ame time that they have no influence by their &s;imi|larity either on each other, or on any external
<PB N="289" REF="300">
object. We mu&s;t therefore, turn our&s;elves to &s;ome other quarter to &s;eek the origin of that idea.</P>
<P>THO' the &s;everal re&s;embling in&s;tances, which give ri&s;e to the idea of power, have no influence on each other, and can never produce any new quality <HI>in the object,</HI> which can be the model of that idea, yet the <HI>ob|&s;ervation</HI> of this re&s;emblance produces a new impre&s;&s;ion <HI>in the mind,</HI> which is its real model. For after we have ob|&s;erv'd the re&s;emblance in a &s;ufficient num|ber of in&s;tances, we immediately feel a de|termination of the mind to pa&s;s from one object to its u&s;ual attendant, and to con|ceive it in a &s;tronger light upon account of that relation. This determination is the on|ly effect of the re&s;emblance; and therefore mu&s;t be the &s;ame with power or efficacy, who&s;e idea is deriv'd from the re&s;emblance. The &s;everal in&s;tances of re&s;embling conjunc|tions lead us into the notion of power and nece&s;&s;ity. The&s;e in&s;tances are in them&s;elves totally di&s;tinct from each other, and have no union but in the mind, which ob&s;erves them, and collects their ideas. Nece&s;&s;ity, then, is the effect of this ob&s;ervation, and is nothing but an internal impre&s;&s;ion of the mind, or a determination to carry our
<PB N="290" REF="301">
thoughts from one object to another. With|out con&s;idering it in this view, we can never arrive at the mo&s;t di&s;tant notion of it, or be able to attribute it either to external or in|ternal objects, to &s;pirit or body, to cau&s;es or effects.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary connexion betwixt cau&s;es and effects is the foundation of our infe|rence from one to the other. The foun|dation of our inference is the tran&s;ition ari|&s;ing from the accu&s;tom'd union. The&s;e are, therefore, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE idea of nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;es from &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion. There is no impre&s;&s;ion con|vey'd by our &s;en&s;es, which can give ri&s;e to that idea. It mu&s;t, therefore, be deriv'd from &s;ome internal impre&s;&s;ion, or impre&s;&s;ion of reflection. There is no internal impre&s;|&s;ion, which has any relation to the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, but that propen&s;ity, which cu&s;|tom produces, to pa&s;s from an object to the idea of its u&s;ual attendant. This therefore is the e&s;&s;ence of nece&s;&s;ity. Upon the whole, nece&s;&s;ity is &s;omething, that ex|i&s;ts in the mind, not in objects; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us ever to form the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of it, con&s;ider'd as a quality in bodies. Either we have no idea of nece&s;&s;ity, or ne|ce&s;&s;ity is nothing but that determination of
<PB N="291" REF="302">
the thought to pa&s;s from cau&s;es to effects and from effects to cau&s;es, according to their experienc'd union.</P>
<P>THUS as the nece&s;&s;ity, which makes two times two equal to four, or three an|gles of a triangle equal to two right ones, lies only in the act of the under&s;tanding, by which we con&s;ider and compare the&s;e ideas; in like manner the nece&s;&s;ity or power, which unites cau&s;es and effects, lies in the deter|mination of the mind to pa&s;s from the one to the other. The efficacy or energy of cau&s;es is neither plac'd in the cau&s;es them&s;elves, nor in the deity, nor in the concurrence of the&s;e two principles; but belongs entirely to the &s;oul, which con&s;i|ders the union of two or more objects in all pa&s;t in&s;tances. 'Tis here that the real power of cau&s;es is plac'd, along with their con|nexion and nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that of all the paradoxes, which I have had, or &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to advance in the cour&s;e of this treati&s;e, the pre&s;ent one is the mo&s;t violent, and that 'tis merely by dint of &s;olid proof and rea&s;oning I can ever hope it will have admi&s;&s;ion, and overcome the inveterate prejudices of mankind. Before we are re|concil'd to this doctrine, how often mu&s;t
<PB N="292" REF="303">
we repeat to our&s;elves, <HI>that</HI> the &s;imple view of any two objects or actions, however re|lated, can never give us any idea of power, or of a connexion betwixt them: <HI>that</HI> this idea ari&s;es from the repetition of their uni|on: <HI>that</HI> the repetition neither di&s;covers nor cau&s;es any thing in the objects, but has an influence only on the mind, by that cu&s;|tomary tran&s;ition it produces: <HI>that</HI> this cu&s;|tomary tran&s;ition is, therefore, the &s;ame with the power and nece&s;&s;ity; which are con&s;equently qualities of perceptions, not of objects, and are internally felt by the &s;oul, and not perceiv'd externally in bodies? There is commonly an a&s;toni&s;hment attend|ing every thing extraordinary; and this a|&s;toni&s;hment changes immediately into the highe&s;t degree of e&s;teem or contempt, ac|cording as we approve or di&s;approve of the &s;ubject. I am much afraid, that tho' the fore|going rea&s;oning appears to me the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t deci&s;ive imaginable; yet with the generality of readers the bia&s;s of the mind will prevail, and give them a prejudice a|gain&s;t the pre&s;ent doctrine.</P>
<P>THIS contrary bia&s;s is ea&s;ily accounted for. 'Tis a common ob&s;ervation, that the mind has a great propen&s;ity to &s;pread it&s;elf on external objects, and to conjoin with
<PB N="293" REF="304">
them any internal impre&s;&s;ions, which they occa&s;ion, and which always make their ap|pearance at the &s;ame time that the&s;e ob|jects di&s;cover them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es. Thus as certain &s;ounds and &s;mells are always found to attend certain vi&s;ible objects, we natural|ly imagine a conjunction, even in place, betwixt the objects and qualities, tho' the qualities be of &s;uch a nature as to admit of no &s;uch conjunction, and really exi&s;ts no where. But of this more fully <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part. IV. Sect. 5.</NOTE> hereafter. Mean while 'tis &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame propen&s;ity is the rea&s;on, why we &s;up|po&s;e nece&s;&s;ity and power to lie in the ob|jects we con&s;ider, not in our mind, that con&s;iders them; notwith&s;tanding it is not po&s;&s;ible for us to form the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of that quality, when it is not taken for the determination of the mind, to pa&s;s from the idea of an object to that of its u&s;ual at|tendant.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this be the only rea&s;onable account we can give of nece&s;&s;ity, the con|trary notion is &s;o riveted in the mind from the principles above-mention'd, that I doubt not but my &s;entiments will be treated by many as extravagant and ridiculous. What! the efficacy of cau&s;es lie in the determi|nation
<PB N="294" REF="305">
of the mind! As if cau&s;es did not operate entirely independent of the mind, and wou'd not continue their operation, e|ven tho' there was no mind exi&s;tent to con|template them, or rea&s;on concerning them. Thought may well depend on cau&s;es for its operation, but not cau&s;es on thought. This is to rever&s;e the order of nature, and make that &s;econdary, which is really primary. To every operation there is a power propor|tion'd; and this power mu&s;t be plac'd on the body, that operates. If we remove the power from one cau&s;e, we mu&s;t a&s;cribe it to another: But to remove it from all cau&s;es, and be&s;tow it on a being, that is no ways related to the cau&s;e or effect, but by per|ceiving them, is a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, and con|trary to the mo&s;t certain principles of hu|man rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I CAN only reply to all the&s;e arguments, that the ca&s;e is here much the &s;ame, as if a blind man &s;hou'd pretend to find a great many ab&s;urdities in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the colour of &s;carlet is not the &s;ame with the &s;ound of a trumpet, nor light the &s;ame with &s;olidity. If we have really no idea of a power or efficacy in any object, or of any real connexion betwixt cau&s;es and effects, 'twill be to little purpo&s;e to prove, that an
<PB N="295" REF="306">
efficacy is nece&s;&s;ary in all operations. We do not under&s;tand our own meaning in talking &s;o, but ignorantly confound ideas, which are entirely di&s;tinct from each other. I am, indeed, ready to allow, that there may be &s;everal qualities both in material and immaterial objects, with which we are ut|terly unacquainted; and if we plea&s;e to call the&s;e <HI>power</HI> or <HI>efficacy,</HI> 'twill be of little con|&s;equence to the world. But when, in&s;tead of meaning the&s;e unknown qualities, we make the terms of power and efficacy &s;igni|fy &s;omething, of which we have a clear idea, and which is incompatible with tho&s;e objects, to which we apply it, ob&s;curity and error begin then to take place, and we are led a&s;tray by a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy. This is the ca&s;e, when we transfer the determi|nation of the thought to external objects, and &s;uppo&s;e any real intelligible connexion betwixt them; that being a quality, which can only belong to the mind that con&s;iders them.</P>
<P>As to what may be &s;aid, that the ope|rations of nature are independent of our thought and rea&s;oning, I allow it; and ac|cordingly have ob&s;erv'd, that objects bear to each other the relations of contiguity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; that like objects may be ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="296" REF="307">
in &s;everal in&s;tances to have like relations; and that all this is independent of, and an|tecedent to the operations of the under&s;tand|ing. But if we go any farther, and a&s;cribe a power or nece&s;&s;ary connexion to the&s;e ob|jects; this is what we can never ob&s;erve in them, but mu&s;t draw the idea of it from what we feel internally in contemplating them. And this I carry &s;o far, that I am ready to convert my pre&s;ent rea&s;oning into an in|&s;tance of it, by a &s;ubtility, which it will not be difficult to comprehend.</P>
<P>WHEN any object is pre&s;ented to us, it immediately conveys to the mind a live|ly idea of that object, which is u&s;ually found to attend it; and this determination of the mind forms the nece&s;&s;ary connexion of the&s;e objects. But when we change the point of view, from the objects to the perceptions; in that ca&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion is to be con&s;i|dered as the cau&s;e, and the lively idea as the effect; and their nece&s;&s;ary connexion is that new determination, which we feel to pa&s;s from the idea of the one to that of the other. The uniting principle among our in|ternal perceptions is as unintelligible as that among external objects, and is not known to us any other way than by experience. Now the nature and effects of experience have been
<PB N="297" REF="308">
already &s;ufficiently examin'd and explain'd. It never gives us any in&s;ight into the internal &s;tructure or operating principle of objects, but only accu&s;toms the mind to pa&s;s from one to another.</P>
<P>'TIS now time to collect all the diffe|rent parts of this rea&s;oning, and by joining them together form an exact definition of the relation of cau&s;e and effect, which makes the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent enquiry. This order wou'd not have been excu&s;able, of fir&s;t examining our inference from the re|lation before we had explain'd the relation it&s;elf, had it been po&s;&s;ible to proceed in a different method. But as the nature of the relation depends &s;o much on that of the infe|rence, we have been oblig'd to advance in this &s;eemingly propo&s;terous manner, and make u&s;e of terms before we were able exactly to define them, or fix their meaning. We &s;hall now correct this fault by giving a pre|ci&s;e definition of cau&s;e and effect.</P>
<P>THERE may two definitions be given of this relation, which are only different, by their pre&s;enting a different view of the &s;ame object, and making us con&s;ider it either as a <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> or as a <HI>natural</HI> relation; either as a compari&s;on of two ideas, or as an a&s;&s;o|ciation betwixt them. We may define a
<PB N="298" REF="309">
CAUSE to be <Q>An object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects re&s;embling the former are plac'd in like relations of precedency and conti|guity to tho&s;e objects, that re&s;emble the latter.</Q> If this definition be e&s;teem'd de|fective, becau&s;e drawn from objects foreign to the cau&s;e, we may &s;ub&s;titute this other definition in its place, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>A CAUSE is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and &s;o united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the one to form a more lively idea of the other.</Q> Shou'd this defini|tion al&s;o be rejected for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I know no other remedy, than that the per&s;ons, who expre&s;s this delicacy, &s;hou'd &s;ub&s;titute a ju&s;ter definition in its place. But for my part I mu&s;t own my incapacity for &s;uch an undertaking. When I examine with the utmo&s;t accuracy tho&s;e objects, which are commonly denominated cau&s;es and ef|fects, I find, in con&s;idering a &s;ingle in&s;tance, that the one object is precedent and conti|guous to the other; and in inlarging my view to con&s;ider &s;everal in&s;tances, I find only, that like objects are con&s;tantly plac'd in like relations of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and contiguity
<PB N="299" REF="310">
Again, when I con&s;ider the influence of this con&s;tant conjunction, I perceive, that &s;uch a relation can never be an object of rea&s;on|ing, and can never operate upon the mind, but by means of cu&s;tom, which determines the imagination to make a tran&s;ition from the idea of one object to that of its u&s;ual attendant, and from the impre&s;&s;ion of one to a more lively idea of the other. However extraordinary the&s;e &s;entiments may appear, I think it fruitle&s;s to trouble my&s;elf with any farther enquiry or rea&s;oning upon the &s;ub|ject, but &s;hall repo&s;e my&s;elf on them as on e&s;tabli&s;h'd maxims.</P>
<P>'TWILL only be proper, before we leave this &s;ubject, to draw &s;ome corrollaries from it, by which we may remove &s;everal pre|judices and popular errors, that have very much prevail'd in philo&s;ophy. Fir&s;t, We may learn from the foregoing doctrine, that all cau&s;es are of the &s;ame kind, and that in particular there is no foundation for that di&s;tinction, which we &s;ometimes make be|twixt efficient cau&s;es, and cau&s;es <HI>&s;ine qua non;</HI> or betwixt efficient cau&s;es, and formal, and material, and exemplary, and final cau&s;es. For as our idea of efficiency is deriv'd from the con&s;tant conjunction of two objects, where|ever this is ob&s;erv'd, the cau&s;e is efficient;
<PB N="300" REF="311">
and where it is not, there can never be a cau&s;e of any kind. For the &s;ame rea&s;on we mu&s;t reject the di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> when &s;uppos'd to &s;ignify any thing e&s;&s;entially different from each other. If con|&s;tant conjunction be imply'd in what we call occa&s;ion, 'tis a real cau&s;e. If not, 'tis no relation at all, and cannot give ri&s;e to any argument or rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The &s;ame cour&s;e of rea&s;on|ing will make us conclude, that there is but one kind of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> as there is but one kind of cau&s;e, and that the common di&s;|tinction betwixt <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> nece&s;&s;ity is without any foundation in nature. This clearly appears from the precedent explica|tion of nece&s;&s;ity. 'Tis the con&s;tant con|junction of objects, along with the deter|mination of the mind, which con&s;titutes a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity: And the removal of the&s;e is the &s;ame thing with <HI>chance.</HI> As objects mu&s;t either be conjoin'd or not, and as the mind mu&s;t either be determin'd or not to pa&s;s from one object to another, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. In weak|ening this conjunction and determination you do not change the nature of the nece&s;&s;ity; &s;ince even in the operation of bodies, the&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="312">
have different degrees of con&s;tancy and force, without producing a different &s;pecies of that relation.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction, which we often make betwixt <HI>power</HI> and the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of it, is equally without foundation.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We may now be able fully to overcome all that repugnance, which 'tis &s;o natural for us to entertain again&s;t the foregoing rea&s;oning, by which we endea|vour'd to prove, that the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e to every beginning of exi&s;tence is not founded on any arguments either demon&s;trative or intuitive. Such an opinion will not appear &s;trange after the foregoing definitions. If we define a cau&s;e to be <HI>an object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects re&s;embling the former are plac'd in a like relation of priority and contiguity to tho&s;e objects, that re&s;emble the latter;</HI> we may ea&s;ily conceive, that there is no ab&s;olute nor metaphy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, that every beginning of exi&s;tence &s;hou'd be attended with &s;uch an object. If we define a cau&s;e to be, <HI>An object precedent and contiguous to another, and &s;o united with it in the imagination, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the one to form a more lively idea</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="313">
and where it is not, there can never be a cau&s;e of any kind. For the &s;ame rea&s;on we mu&s;t reject the di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> when &s;uppos'd to &s;ignify any thing e&s;&s;entially different from each other. If con|&s;tant conjunction be imply'd in what we call occa&s;ion, 'tis a real cau&s;e. If not, 'tis no relation at all, and cannot give ri&s;e to any argument or rea&s;oning.</P>

<P>THIRDLY, We may now be able fully to overcome all that repugnance, which 'tis &s;o natural for us to entertain again&s;t the foregoing rea&s;oning, by which we endea|vour'd to prove, that the nece&s;&s;ity of a cau&s;e to every beginning of exi&s;tence is not founded on any arguments either demon&s;trative or intuitive. Such an opinion will not appear &s;trange after the foregoing definitions. If we define a cau&s;e to be <HI>an object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects re&s;embling the former are plac'd in a like relation of priority and contiguity to tho&s;e objects, that re&s;emble the latter;</HI> we may ea&s;ily conceive, that there is no ab&s;olute nor metaphy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, that every beginning of exi&s;tence &s;hou'd be attended with &s;uch an object. If we define a cau&s;e to be, <HI>An object precedent and contiguous to another, and &s;o united with it in the imagination, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the one to form a more lively idea</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="315">
<HI>of the other;</HI> we &s;hall make &s;till le&s;s diffi|culty of a&s;&s;enting to this opinion. Such an influence on the mind is in it&s;elf perfectly extraordinary and incomprehen&s;ible; nor can we be certain of its reality, but from ex|perience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I SHALL add as a fourth corrollary, that we can never have rea&s;on to believe that any object exi&s;ts, of which we cannot form an idea. For as all our rea&s;onings concerning exi&s;tence are deriv'd from cau&s;ation, and as all our rea&s;onings concerning cau&s;ation are deriv'd from the experienc'd conjunction of objects, not from any rea&s;oning or reflec|tion, the &s;ame experience mu&s;t give us a notion of the&s;e objects, and mu&s;t remove all my&s;tery from our conclu&s;ions. This is &s;o evident, that 'twou'd &s;carce have merited our attention, were it not to obviate certain ob|jections of this kind, which might ari&s;e a|gain&s;t the following rea&s;onings concerning <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> I need not ob&s;erve, that a full knowledge of the object is not requi&s;ite, but only of tho&s;e qualities of it, which we believe to exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. <HI>Rules by which to judge of cau&s;es and effects.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to the precedent doc|trine, there are no objects, which by the mere &s;urvey, without con&s;ulting expe|rience, we can determine to be the cau&s;es of any other; and no objects, which we can certainly determine in the &s;ame manner not to be the cau&s;es. Any thing may produce any thing. Creation, annihilation, motion, rea&s;on, volition; all the&s;e may ari&s;e from one another, or from any other object we can imagine. Nor will this appear &s;trange, if we compare two principles explain'd above, <HI>that the con&s;tant conjunction of objects deter|mines their cau&s;ation,</HI> and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. Sect. 5.</NOTE> <HI>that properly &s;peaking, no objects are contrary to each other, but exi&s;tence and non-exi&s;tence.</HI> Where objects are not contrary, nothing hinders them from having that con&s;tant conjunc|tion, on which the relation of cau&s;e and effect totally depends.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore 'tis po&s;&s;ible for all ob|jects to become cau&s;es or effects to each
<PB N="304" REF="317">
other, it may be proper to fix &s;ome general rules, by which we may know when they really are &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE cau&s;e and effect mu&s;t be conti|guous in &s;pace and time.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE cau&s;e mu&s;t be prior to the ef|fect.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE mu&s;t be a con&s;tant union be|twixt the cau&s;e and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that con&s;titutes the relation.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;ame cau&s;e always produces the &s;ame effect, and the &s;ame effect never ari&s;es but from the &s;ame cau&s;e. This principle we derive from experience, and is the &s;ource of mo&s;t of our philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings. For when by any clear experiment we have di&s;|cover'd the cau&s;es or effects of any phaeno|menon, we immediately extend our ob&s;er|vation to every phaenomenon of the &s;ame kind, without waiting for that con&s;tant re|petition, from which the fir&s;t idea of this relation is deriv'd.</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE is another principle, which hangs upon this, <HI>viz.</HI> that where &s;everal different objects produce the &s;ame effect, it mu&s;t be by means of &s;ome quality, which we di&s;cover to be common among&s;t them. For as like effects imply like cau&s;es, we mu&s;t always a&s;cribe the cau&s;ation to the circum|&s;tance,
<PB N="305" REF="318">
wherein we di&s;cover the re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE following principle is founded on the &s;ame rea&s;on. The difference in the effects of two re&s;embling objects mu&s;t pro|ceed from that particular, in which they differ. For as like cau&s;es always produce like effects, when in any in&s;tance we find our expectation to be di&s;appointed, we mu&s;t conclude that this irregularity proceeds from &s;ome difference in the cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="7">7. WHEN any object encrea&s;es or dimi|ni&s;hes with the encrea&s;e or diminution of its cau&s;e, 'tis to be regarded as a compounded effect, deriv'd from the union of the &s;everal different effects, which ari&s;e from the &s;everal different parts of the cau&s;e. The ab&s;ence or pre&s;ence of one part of the cau&s;e is here &s;uppos'd to be always attended with the ab|&s;ence or pre&s;ence of a proportionable part of the effect. This con&s;tant conjunction &s;uffi|ciently proves, that the one part is the cau&s;e of the other. We mu&s;t, however, beware not to draw &s;uch a conclu&s;ion from a few experiments. A certain degree of heat gives plea&s;ure; if you dimini&s;h that heat, the plea&s;ure dimini&s;hes; but it does not follow, that if you augment it be|yond a certain degree, the plea&s;ure will
<PB N="306" REF="319">
likewi&s;e augment; for we find that it dege|nerates into pain.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE eighth and la&s;t rule I &s;hall take notice of is, that an object, which ex|i&s;ts for any time in its full perfection with|out any effect, is not the &s;ole cau&s;e of that effect, but requires to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome other principle, which may forward its in|fluence and operation. For as like effects nece&s;&s;arily follow from like cau&s;es, and in a contiguous time and place, their &s;eparation for a moment &s;hews, that the&s;e cau&s;es are not compleat ones.</P>
<P>HERE is all the LOGIC I think proper to employ in my rea&s;oning; and perhaps even this was not very nece&s;&s;ary, but might have been &s;upply'd by the natural principles of our under&s;tanding. Our &s;chola&s;tic head|pieces and logicians &s;hew no &s;uch &s;uperi|ority above the mere vulgar in their rea&s;on and ability, as to give us any inclination to imitate them in delivering a long &s;y&s;tem of rules and precepts to direct our judgment, in philo&s;ophy. All the rules of this na|ture are very ea&s;y in their invention, but extremely difficult in their application; and even experimental philo&s;ophy, which &s;eems the mo&s;t natural and &s;imple of any, requires the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human judgment.
<PB N="307" REF="320">
There is no phaenomenon in nature, but what is compounded and modify'd by &s;o many different circum&s;tances, that in order to arrive at the deci&s;ive point, we mu&s;t carefully &s;eparate whatever is &s;uperfluous, and enquire by new experiments, if every particular circum&s;tance of the fir&s;t experi|ment was e&s;&s;ential to it. The&s;e new expe|riments are liable to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame kind; &s;o that the utmo&s;t con&s;tancy is re|quir'd to make us per&s;evere in our enquiry, and the utmo&s;t &s;agacity to choo&s;e the right way among &s;o many that pre&s;ent them&s;elves. If this be the ca&s;e even in natural philo&s;ophy, how much more in moral, where there is a much greater complication of circum&s;tances, and where tho&s;e views and &s;entiments, which are e&s;&s;ential to any action of the mind, are &s;o implicit and ob&s;cure, that they often e&s;cape our &s;tricte&s;t attention, and are not only unaccountable in their cau&s;es, but even unknown in their exi&s;tence? I am much a|fraid, le&s;t the &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s I meet with in my enquiries will make this ob&s;ervation bear the air of an apology rather than of boa&s;t|ing.</P>
<P>IF any thing can give me &s;ecurity in this particular, 'twill be the enlarging the &s;phere of my experiments as much as po&s;&s;ible; for

which rea&s;on it may be proper in this place to examine the rea&s;oning faculty of brutes, as well as that of human creatures.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. <HI>Of the rea&s;on of animals.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the ridicule of denying an evident truth, is that of taking much pains to defend it; and no truth appears to me more evident, than that bea&s;ts are endow'd with thought and rea&s;on as well as men. The arguments are in this ca&s;e &s;o obvious, that they never e&s;cape the mo&s;t &s;tupid and ignorant.</P>
<P>WE are con&s;cious, that we our&s;elves, in adapting means to ends, are guided by rea|&s;on and de&s;ign, and that 'tis not ignorantly nor ca&s;ually we perform tho&s;e actions, which tend to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to the obtaining plea&s;ure, and avoiding pain. When there|fore we &s;ee other creatures, in millions of in&s;tances, perform like actions, and direct them to like ends, all our principles of rea|&s;on and probability carry us with an invin|cible force to believe the exi&s;tence of a like cau&s;e. 'Tis needle&s;s in my opinion to il|lu&s;trate this argument by the enumeration
<PB N="309" REF="322">
of particulars. The &s;malle&s;t attention will &s;upply us with more than are requi&s;ite. The re&s;emblance betwixt the actions of animals and tho&s;e of men is &s;o entire in this re&s;pect, that the very fir&s;t action of the fir&s;t animal we &s;hall plea&s;e to pitch on, will afford us an inconte&s;table argument for the pre&s;ent doctrine.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is as u&s;eful as it is obvious, and furni&s;hes us with a kind of touch&s;tone, by which we may try every &s;y&s;tem in this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy. 'Tis from the re|&s;emblance of the external actions of animals to tho&s;e we our&s;elves perform, that we judge their internal likewi&s;e to re&s;emble ours; and the &s;ame principle of rea&s;oning, carry'd one &s;tep farther, will make us conclude that &s;ince our internal actions re&s;emble each other, the cau&s;es, from which they are deriv'd, mu&s;t al&s;o be re&s;embling. When any hypothe&s;is, therefore, is advanc'd to explain a mental ope|ration, which is common to men and bea&s;ts, we mu&s;t apply the &s;ame hypothe&s;is to both; and as every true hypothe&s;is will abide this trial, &s;o I may venture to affirm, that no fal&s;e one will ever be able to endure it. The common defect of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which philo&s;ophers have employ'd to account for the actions of the mind, is, that they &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="310" REF="323">
&s;uch a &s;ubtility and refinement of thought, as not only exceeds the capacity of mere animals, but even of children and the common people in our own &s;pecies; who are notwith&s;tanding &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame emotions and affections as per&s;ons of the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd genius and under&s;tanding. Such a &s;ubtility is a clear proof of the fal&s;hood, as the contrary &s;implicity of the truth, of any &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>LET us therefore put our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem concerning the nature of the under&s;tanding to this deci&s;ive trial, and &s;ee whether it will equally account for the rea&s;onings of bea&s;ts as for the&s;e of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>HERE we mu&s;t make a di&s;tinction be|twixt tho&s;e actions of animals, which are of a vulgar nature, and &s;eem to be on a level with their common capacities, and tho&s;e more extraordinary in&s;tances of &s;agacity, which they &s;ometimes di&s;cover for their own pre&s;ervation, and the propagation of their &s;pecies. A dog, that avoids fire and preci|pices, that &s;huns &s;trangers, and care&s;&s;es his ma&s;ter, affords us an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind. A bird, that choo&s;es with &s;uch care and nicety the place and materials of her ne&s;t, and &s;its upon her eggs for a due time, and in a &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on, with all the pre|caution
<PB N="311" REF="324">
that a chymi&s;t is capable of in the mo&s;t delicate projection, furni&s;hes us with a lively in&s;tance of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>AS to the former actions, I a&s;&s;ert they proceed from a rea&s;oning, that is not in it|&s;elf different, nor founded on different prin|ciples, from that which appears in hu|man nature. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place, that there be &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion im|mediately pre&s;ent to their memory or &s;en&s;es, in order to be the foundation of their judg|ment. From the tone of voice the dog in|fers his ma&s;ter's anger, and fore&s;ees his own puni&s;hment. From a certain &s;en&s;ation af|fecting his &s;mell, he judges his game not to be far di&s;tant from him.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The inference he draws from the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion is built on ex|perience, and on his ob&s;ervation of the con|junction of objects in pa&s;t in&s;tances. As you vary this experience, he varies his rea&s;oning. Make a beating follow upon one &s;ign or motion for &s;ome time, and afterwards upon another; and he will &s;ucce&s;&s;ively draw dif|ferent conclu&s;ions, according to his mo&s;t re|cent experience.</P>
<P>NOW let any philo&s;opher make a trial, and endeavour to explain that act of the mind, which we call <HI>belief,</HI> and give an ac|count
<PB N="312" REF="325">
of the principles, from which it is deriv'd, independent of the influence of cu&s;|tom on the imagination, and let his hypo|the&s;is be equally applicable to bea&s;ts as to the human &s;pecies; and after he has done this, I promi&s;e to embrace his opinion. But at the &s;ame time I demand as an equitable condition, that if my &s;y&s;tem be the only one, which can an&s;wer to all the&s;e terms, it may be receiv'd as entirely &s;atisfactory and convincing. And that 'tis the only one, is evident almo&s;t without any rea&s;oning. Bea&s;ts certainly never perceive any real con|nexion among objects. 'Tis therefore by experience they infer one from another. They can never by any arguments form a general conclu&s;ion, that tho&s;e objects, of which they have had no experience, re|&s;emble tho&s;e of which they have. 'Tis there|fore by means of cu&s;tom alone, that experi|ence operates upon them. All this was &s;uffici|ently evident with re&s;pect to man. But with re&s;pect to bea&s;ts there cannot be the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;take; which mu&s;t be own'd to be a &s;trong confirmation, or rather an invincible proof of my &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;hews more the force of ha|bit in reconciling us to any phaenomenon, than this, that men are not a&s;toni&s;h'd at the ope|rations
<PB N="313" REF="326">
of their own rea&s;on, at the &s;ame time, that they admire the <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> of ani|mals, and find a difficulty in explaining it, merely becau&s;e it cannot be reduc'd to the very &s;ame principles. To con&s;ider the mat|ter aright, rea&s;on is nothing but a wonder|ful and unintelligible in&s;tinct in our &s;ouls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qua|lities, according to their particular &s;ituations and relations. This in&s;tinct, 'tis true, ari&s;es from pa&s;t ob&s;ervation and experience; but can any one give the ultimate rea&s;on, why pa&s;t experience and ob&s;ervation produces &s;uch an effect, any more than why nature alone &s;hou'd produce it? Nature may cer|tainly produce whatever can ari&s;e from ha|bit: Nay, habit is nothing but one of the principles of nature, and derives all its force from that origin.</P>

<P>_IN all demon&s;trative &s;ciences the rules are certain and infallible; but when we apply them, our fallible and uncertain faculties are very apt to depart from them, and fall into error. We mu&s;t, therefore, in every rea&s;oning form a new judgment, as a check or con|troul on our fir&s;t judgment or belief; and mu&s;t enlarge our view to comprehend a kind of hi&s;tory of all the in&s;tances, where|in our under&s;tanding has deceiv'd us, com|par'd with tho&s;e, wherein its te&s;timony was ju&s;t and true. Our rea&s;on mu&s;t be con&s;i|&s;ider'd
<PB N="316" REF="328">
as a kind of cau&s;e, of which truth is the natural effect; but &s;uch-a-one as by the irruption of other cau&s;es, and by the incon|&s;tancy of our mental powers, may frequent|ly be prevented. By this means all know|ledge degenerates into probability; and this probability is greater or le&s;s, according to our experience of the veracity or deceitful|ne&s;s of our under&s;tanding, and according to the &s;implicity or intricacy of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THERE is no Algebrai&s;t nor Mathema|tician &s;o expert in his &s;cience, as to place entire confidence in any truth immediately upon his di&s;covery of it, or regard it as any thing, but a mere probability. Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence en|crea&s;es; but &s;till more by the approbation of his friends; and is rais'd to its utmo&s;t perfection by the univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent and ap|plau&s;es of the learned world. Now 'tis evident, that this gradual encrea&s;e of a&s;&s;u|rance is nothing but the addition of new probabilities, and is deriv'd from the con|&s;tant union of cau&s;es and effects, according to pa&s;t experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>IN accompts of any length or impor|tance, Merchants &s;eldom tru&s;t to the infal|lible certainty of numbers for their &s;ecurity; but by the artificial &s;tructure of the accompts,
<PB N="317" REF="329">
produce a probability beyond what is de|riv'd from the &s;kill and experience of the accomptant. For that is plainly of it&s;elf &s;ome degree of probability; tho' uncertain and variable, according to the degrees of his experience and length of the accompt. Now as none will maintain, that our a&s;&s;urance in a long numeration exceeds probability, I may &s;afely affirm, that there &s;carce is any propo&s;ition concerning numbers, of which we can have a fuller &s;ecurity. For 'tis ea&s;i|ly po&s;&s;ible, by gradually dimini&s;hing the numbers, to reduce the longe&s;t &s;eries of ad|dition to the mo&s;t &s;imple que&s;tion, which can be form'd, to an addition of two &s;ingle numbers; and upon this &s;uppo&s;i|tion we &s;hall find it impracticable to &s;hew the preci&s;e limits of knowledge and of pro|bability, or di&s;cover that particular num|ber, at which the one ends and the other begins. But knowledge and probability are of &s;uch contrary and di&s;agreeing natures, that they cannot well run in&s;en&s;ibly into each o|ther, and that becau&s;e they will not divide, but mu&s;t be either entirely pre&s;ent, or en|tirely ab&s;ent. Be&s;ides, if any &s;ingle addi|tion were certain, every one wou'd be &s;o, and con&s;equently the whole or total &s;um; unle&s;s the whole can be different from all
<PB N="318" REF="330">
its parts. I had almo&s;t &s;aid, that this was certain; but I reflect, that it mu&s;t reduce <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> as well as every other rea&s;oning, and from knowledge degenerate into probabi|lity.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore all knowledge re&s;olves it&s;elf into probability, and becomes at la&s;t of the &s;ame nature with that evidence, which we employ in common life, we mu&s;t now examine this latter &s;pecies of rea&s;oning, and &s;ee on what foundation it &s;tands.</P>
<P>IN every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concern|ing knowledge, we ought always to correct the fir&s;t judgment, deriv'd from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv'd from the nature of the under&s;tanding. 'Tis certain a man of &s;olid &s;en&s;e and long ex|perience ought to have, and u&s;ually has, a greater a&s;&s;urance in his opinions, than one that is fooli&s;h and ignorant, and that our &s;entiments have different degrees of autho|rity, even with our&s;elves, in proportion to the degrees of our rea&s;on and experience. In the man of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e and longe&s;t ex|perience, this authority is never entire; &s;ince even &s;uch-a-one mu&s;t be con&s;cious of many errors in the pa&s;t, and mu&s;t &s;till dread the like for the future. Here then ari&s;es a new
<PB N="319" REF="331">
&s;pecies of probability to correct and regulate the fir&s;t, and fix its ju&s;t &s;tandard and pro|portion. As demon&s;tration is &s;ubject to the controul of probability, &s;o is probability li|able to a new correction by a reflex act of the mind, wherein the nature of our under|&s;tanding, and our rea&s;oning from the fir&s;t probability become our objects.</P>
<P>HAVING thus found in every probability, be&s;ide the original uncertainty inherent in the &s;ubject, a new uncertainty deriv'd from the weakne&s;s of that faculty, which judges, and having adju&s;ted the&s;e two together, we are oblig'd by our rea&s;on to add a new doubt deriv'd from the po&s;&s;ibility of error in the e&s;timation we make of the truth and fidelity of our faculties. This is a doubt, which immediately occurs to us, and of which, if we wou'd clo&s;ely pur&s;ue our rea|&s;on, we cannot avoid giving a deci&s;ion. But this deci&s;ion, tho' it &s;hou'd be favourable to our preceeding judgment, being founded only on probability, mu&s;t weaken &s;till fur|ther our fir&s;t evidence, and mu&s;t it&s;elf be weaken'd by a fourth doubt of the &s;ame kind, and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum;</HI> till at la&s;t there remain nothing of the original proba|bility, however great we may &s;uppo&s;e it to have been, and however &s;mall the diminu|tion
<PB N="320" REF="332">
by every new uncertainty. No finite object can &s;ub&s;i&s;t under a decrea&s;e repeated <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and even the va&s;te&s;t quanity, which can enter into human imagination, mu&s;t in this manner be reduc'd to nothing. Let our fir&s;t belief be never &s;o &s;trong, it mu&s;t infallibly peri&s;h by pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;o many new examinations, of which each di|mini&s;hes &s;omewhat of its force and vigour. When I reflect on the natural fallibility of my judgment, I have le&s;s confidence in my opinions, than when I only con&s;ider the ob|jects concerning which I rea&s;on; and when I proceed &s;till farther, to turn the &s;crutiny again&s;t every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive e&s;timation I make of my faculties, all the rules of logic re|quire a continual diminution, and at la&s;t a total extinction of belief and evidence.</P>
<P>SHOU'D it here be a&s;k'd me, whether I &s;incerely a&s;&s;ent to this argument, which I &s;eem to take &s;uch pains to inculcate, and whether I be really one of tho&s;e &s;ceptics, who hold that all is uncertain, and that our judgment is not in <HI>any</HI> thing po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>any</HI> mea&s;ures of truth and fal&s;hood; I &s;hou'd reply, that this que&s;tion is entirely &s;uperfluous, and that neither I, nor any other per&s;on was ever &s;incerely and con&s;tantly of that opinion.

has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel; nor can we any more forbear viewing certain objects in a &s;tronger and fuller light, upon account of their cu&s;tomary connexion with a pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, than we can hinder our&s;elves from thinking as long as we are awake, or &s;eeing the &s;urrounding bodies, when we turn our eyes towards them in broad &s;un|&s;hine. Whoever has taken the pains to re|fute the cavils of this <HI>total</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m, has really di&s;puted without an antagoni&s;t, and endeavour'd by arguments to e&s;tabli&s;h a fa|culty, which nature has antecedently im|planted in the mind, and render'd unavoid|able.</P>
<P>MY intention then in di&s;playing &s;o care|fully the arguments of that fanta&s;tic &s;ect, is only to make the reader &s;en&s;ible of the truth of my hypothe&s;is, <HI>that all our rea|&s;onings concerning cau&s;es and effects are de|riv'd from nothing but cu&s;tom; and that be|lief is more properly an act of the &s;en&s;itive, than of the cogitative part of our natures.</HI> I have here prov'd, that the very &s;ame prin|ciples, which make us form a deci&s;ion up|on any &s;ubject, and correct that deci&s;ion by the con&s;ideration of our genius and capaci|ty, and of the &s;ituation of our mind, when
<PB N="322" REF="334">
we examin'd that &s;ubject; I &s;ay, I have prov'd, that the&s;e &s;ame principles, when carry'd farther, and apply'd to every new reflex judgment, mu&s;t, by continually dimini&s;hing the original evidence, at la&s;t reduce it to nothing, and utterly &s;ubvert all belief and o|pinion. If belief, therefore, were a &s;imple act of the thought, without any peculiar man|ner of conception, or the addition of a force and vivacity, it mu&s;t infallibly de&s;troy it|&s;elf, and in every ca&s;e terminate in a total &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgment. But as experience will &s;ufficiently convince any one, who thinks it worth while to try, that tho' he can find no error in the foregoing argu|ments, yet he &s;till continues to believe, and think, and rea&s;on as u&s;ual, he may &s;afely conclude, that his rea&s;oning and belief is &s;ome &s;en&s;ation or peculiar manner of con|ception, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for mere ideas and reflections to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>BUT here, perhaps, it may be demand|ed, how it happens, even upon my hypo|the&s;is, that the&s;e arguments above-explain'd produce not a total &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgment, and after what manner the mind ever re|tains a degree of a&s;&s;urance in any &s;ubject? For as the&s;e new probabilities, which by their repetition perpetually dimini&s;h the ori|ginal
<PB N="323" REF="335">
evidence, are founded on the very &s;ame principles, whether of thought or &s;en|&s;ation, as the primary judgment, it may &s;eem unavoidable, that in either ca&s;e they mu&s;t equally &s;ubvert it, and by the oppo|&s;ition, either of contrary thoughts or &s;en&s;a|tions, reduce the mind to a total uncertain|ty. I &s;uppo&s;e, there is &s;ome que&s;tion pro|pos'd to me, and that after revolving over the impre&s;&s;ions of my memory and &s;en&s;es, and carrying my thoughts from them to &s;uch objects, as are commonly conjoin'd with them, I feel a &s;tronger and more for|cible conception on the one &s;ide, than on the other. This &s;trong conception forms my fir&s;t deci&s;ion. I &s;uppo&s;e, that afterwards I examine my judgment it&s;elf, and ob&s;erving from experience, that 'tis &s;ometimes ju&s;t and &s;ometimes erroneous, I con&s;ider it as regu|lated by contrary principles or cau&s;es, of which &s;ome lead to truth, and &s;ome to er|ror; and in ballancing the&s;e contrary cau&s;es, I dimini&s;h by a new probability the a&s;&s;u|rance of my fir&s;t deci&s;ion. This new pro|bability is liable to the &s;ame diminution as the foregoing, and &s;o on, <HI>in infinitum.</HI> 'Tis therefore demanded, <HI>how it happens, that even after all we retain a degree of belief,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="336">
<HI>which is &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e, either in philo&s;ophy or common life.</HI></P>
<P>I ANSWER, that after the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond deci&s;ion; as the action of the mind becomes forc'd and unnatural, and the ideas faint and ob&s;cure; tho' the principles of judgment, and the ballancing of oppo&s;ite cau&s;es be the &s;ame as at the very beginning; yet their influence on the imagination, and the vigour they add to, or dimini&s;h from the thought, is by no means equal. Where the mind reaches not its objects with ea|&s;ine&s;s and facility, the &s;ame principles have not the &s;ame effect as in a more na|tural conception of the ideas; nor does the imagination feel a &s;en&s;ation, which holds any proportion with that which ari&s;es from its common judgments and opinions. The attention is on the &s;tretch: The po&s;ture of the mind is unea&s;y; and the &s;pirits being diverted from their natural cour&s;e, are not govern'd in their movements by the &s;ame laws, at lea&s;t not to the &s;ame degree, as when they flow in their u&s;ual channel.</P>
<P>IF we de&s;ire &s;imilar in&s;tances, 'twill not be very difficult to find them. The pre&s;ent &s;ubject of metaphy&s;ics will &s;upply us abun|dantly. The &s;ame argument, which wou'd have been e&s;teem'd convincing in a rea&s;oning
<PB N="325" REF="337">
concerning hi&s;tory or politics, has little or no influence in the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;er &s;ubjects, even tho' it be perfectly comprehended; and that becau&s;e there is requir'd a &s;tudy and an ef|fort of thought, in order to its being com|prehended: And this effort of thought di|&s;turbs the operation of our &s;entiments, on which the belief depends. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in other &s;ubjects. The &s;training of the imagination always hinders the regular flow|ing of the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments. A tra|gic poet, that wou'd repre&s;ent his heroes as very ingenious and witty in their misfor|tunes, wou'd never touch the pa&s;&s;ions. As the emotions of the &s;oul prevent any &s;ubtile rea&s;oning and reflection, &s;o the&s;e latter ac|tions of the mind are equally prejudicial to the former. The mind, as well as the bo|dy, &s;eems to be endow'd with a certain pre|ci&s;e degree of force and activity, which it never employs in one action, but at the ex|pence of all the re&s;t. This is more evident|ly true, where the actions are of quite dif|ferent natures; &s;ince in that ca&s;e the force of the mind is not only diverted, but even the di&s;po&s;ition chang'd, &s;o as render us in|capable of a &s;udden tran&s;ition from one ac|tion to the other, and &s;till more of per|forming both at once. No wonder, then,
<PB N="326" REF="338">
the conviction, which ari&s;es from a &s;ubtile rea&s;oning, dimini&s;hes in proportion to the efforts, which the imagination makes to en|ter into the rea&s;oning, and to conceive it in all its parts. Belief, being a lively concep|tion, can never be entire, where it is not founded on &s;omething natural and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>THIS I take to be the true &s;tate of the que&s;tion, and cannot approve of that expedi|tious way, which &s;ome take with the &s;cep|tics, to reject at once all their arguments without enquiry or examination. If the &s;ceptical rea&s;onings be &s;trong, &s;ay they, 'tis a proof, that rea&s;on may have &s;ome force and authority: if weak, they can never be &s;uffi|cient to invalidate all the conclu&s;ions of our under&s;tanding. This argument is not ju&s;t; becau&s;e the &s;ceptical rea&s;onings, were it po&s;|&s;ible for them to exi&s;t, and were they not de&s;troy'd by their &s;ubtility, wou'd be &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively both &s;trong and weak, according to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;itions of the mind. Rea&s;on fir&s;t appears in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, pre&s;cribing laws, and impo&s;ing max|ims, with an ab&s;olute &s;way and authority. Her enemy, therefore, is oblig'd to take &s;helter under her protection, and by make|ing u&s;e of rational arguments to prove the fallaciou&s;ne&s;s and imbecility of rea&s;on, pro|duces,
<PB N="327" REF="339">
in a manner, a patent under her hand and &s;eal. This patent has at fir&s;t an authority, proportion'd to the pre&s;ent and immediate authority of rea&s;on, from which it is deriv'd. But as it is &s;uppos'd to be contradictory to rea&s;on, it gradually dimi|ni&s;hes the force of that governing power, and its own at the &s;ame time; till at la&s;t they both vani&s;h away into nothing, by a regu|lar and ju&s;t diminution. The &s;ceptical and dogmatical rea&s;ons are of the &s;ame kind, tho' contrary in their operation and tendency; &s;o that where the latter is &s;trong, it has an enemy of equal force in the former to encounter; and as their forces were at fir&s;t equal, they &s;till continue &s;o, as long as either of them &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; nor does one of them lo&s;e any force in the conte&s;t, without taking as much from its antagoni&s;t. 'Tis happy, therefore, that nature breaks the force of all &s;ceptical arguments in time, and keeps them from having any con&s;iderable influence on the under&s;tanding. Were we to tru&s;t en|tirely to their &s;elf-de&s;truction, that can ne|ver take place, 'till they have fir&s;t &s;ubverted all conviction, and have totally de&s;troy'd human rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of &s;ceptici&s;m with regard to the &s;en&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS the &s;ceptic &s;till continues to rea&s;on and believe, even tho' he a&s;|&s;erts, that he cannot defend his rea&s;on by rea&s;on; and by the &s;ame rule he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to the principle concerning the exi&s;tence of body, tho' he cannot pretend by any argu|ments of philo&s;ophy to maintain its veracity. Nature has not left this to his choice, and has doubtle&s;s e&s;teem'd it an affair of too great importance to be tru&s;ted to our uncertain rea&s;onings and &s;peculations. We may well a&s;k, <HI>What cau&s;es induce us to be|lieve in the exi&s;tence of body?</HI> but 'tis in vain to a&s;k, <HI>Whether there be body or not?</HI> That is a point, which we mu&s;t take for granted in all our rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject, then, of our pre&s;ent en|quiry is concerning the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> which induce us to believe in the exi&s;tence of body: And my rea&s;onings on this head I &s;hall begin with a di&s;tinction, which at fir&s;t &s;ight may &s;eem &s;uperfluous, but which will contribute very much to the perfect under&s;tanding of
<PB N="329" REF="341">
what follows. We ought to examine apart tho&s;e two que&s;tions, which are commonly confounded together, <HI>viz.</HI> Why we attri|bute a CONTINU'D exi&s;tence to objects, even when they are not pre&s;ent to the &s;en|&s;es; and why we &s;uppo&s;e them to have an exi&s;tence DISTINCT from the mind and perception. Under this la&s;t head I compre|hend their &s;ituation as well as relations, their <HI>external</HI> po&s;ition as well as the <HI>inde|pendence</HI> of their exi&s;tence and operation. The&s;e two que&s;tions concerning the con|tinu'd and di&s;tinct exi&s;tence of body are intimately connected together. For if the objects of our &s;en&s;es continue to exi&s;t, even when they are not perceiv'd, their exi&s;tence is of cour&s;e independent of and di&s;tinct from the perception; and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if their ex|i&s;tence be independent of the perception and di&s;tinct from it, they mu&s;t continue to exi&s;t, even tho' they be not perceiv'd. But tho' the deci&s;ion of the one que&s;tion decides the other; yet that we may the more ea&s;ily di&s;|cover the principles of human nature, from whence the deci&s;ion ari&s;es, we &s;hall carry along with us this di&s;tinction, and &s;hall con&s;ider, whether it be the <HI>&s;en&s;es, rea|&s;on,</HI> or the <HI>imagination,</HI> that produces the opinion of a <HI>continu'd</HI> or of a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> exi&s;|tence.
<PB N="330" REF="342">
The&s;e are the only que&s;tions, that are intelligible on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. For as to the notion of external exi&s;tence, when taken for &s;omething &s;pecifically different from our perceptions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part. II. Sect. 6.</NOTE> we have already &s;hewn its ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>TO begin with the SENSES, 'tis evident the&s;e faculties are incapable of giving ri&s;e to the notion of the <HI>continu'd</HI> exi&s;tence of their objects, after they no longer appear to the &s;en&s;es. For that is a contradiction in terms, and &s;uppo&s;es that the &s;en&s;es continue to operate, even after they have ceas'd all manner of operation. The&s;e fa|culties, therefore, if they have any influ|ence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, mu&s;t produce the opinion of a di&s;tinct, not of a con|tinu'd exi&s;tence; and in order to that, mu&s;t pre&s;ent their impre&s;&s;ions either as ima|ges and repre&s;entations, or as the&s;e very di&s;|tinct and external exi&s;tences.</P>
<P>THAT our &s;en&s;es offer not their impre&s;|&s;ions as the images of &s;omething <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> or <HI>independent,</HI> and <HI>external,</HI> is evident; becau&s;e they convey to us nothing but a &s;ingle per|ception, and never give us the lea&s;t inti|mation of any thing beyond. A &s;ingle per|ception can never produce the idea of a
<PB N="331" REF="343">
double exi&s;tence, but by &s;ome inference either of the rea&s;on or imagination. When the mind looks farther than what imme|diately appears to it, its conclu&s;ions can never be put to the account of the &s;en&s;es; and it certainly looks farther, when from a &s;ingle perception it infers a double exi&s;tence, and &s;uppo&s;es the relations of re&s;emblance and cau&s;ation betwixt them.</P>
<P>IF our &s;en&s;es, therefore, &s;ugge&s;t any idea of di&s;tinct exi&s;tences, they mu&s;t convey the impre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e very exi&s;tences, by a kind of fallacy and illu&s;ion. Upon this head we may ob&s;erve, that all &s;en&s;ations are felt by the mind, &s;uch as they really are, and that when we doubt, whether they pre&s;ent them&s;elves as di&s;tinct objects, or as mere impre&s;&s;ions, the difficulty is not con|cerning their nature, but concerning their relations and &s;ituation. Now if the &s;en&s;es pre&s;ented our impre&s;&s;ions as external to, and independent of our&s;elves, both the objects and our&s;elves mu&s;t be obvious to our &s;en&s;es, otherwi&s;e they cou'd not be compar'd by the&s;e faculties. The difficulty, then, is how far we are <HI>our&s;elves</HI> the objects of our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>'TIS certain there is no que&s;tion in phi|lo&s;ophy more ab&s;tru&s;e than that concerning identity, and the nature of the uniting prin|ciple,
<PB N="332" REF="344">
which con&s;titutes a per&s;on. So far from being able by our &s;en&s;es merely to de|termine this que&s;tion, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t profound metaphy&s;ics to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to it; and in com|mon life 'tis evident the&s;e ideas of &s;elf and per&s;on are never very fix'd nor determinate. 'Tis ab&s;urd, therefore, to imagine the &s;en&s;es can ever di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt our&s;elves and external objects.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that every impre&s;&s;ion, ex|ternal and internal, pa&s;&s;ions, affections, &s;en|&s;ations, pains and plea&s;ures, are originally on the &s;ame footing; and that whatever other differences we may ob&s;erve among them, they appear, all of them, in their true colours, as impre&s;&s;ions or perceptions. And indeed, if we con&s;ider the matter aright, 'tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible it &s;hou'd be otherwi&s;e, nor is it conceivable that our &s;en&s;es &s;hou'd be more capable of deceiving us in the &s;ituation and relations, than in the nature of our impre&s;|&s;ions. For &s;ince all actions and &s;en&s;ations of the mind are known to us by con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they appear. Every thing that enters the mind, being in <HI>reality</HI> as the perception, 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble any thing &s;hou'd to <HI>feeling</HI> appear dif|ferent.
<PB N="333" REF="345">
This were to &s;uppo&s;e, that even where we are mo&s;t intimately con&s;cious, we might be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>BUT not to lo&s;e time in examining, whe|ther 'tis po&s;&s;ible for our &s;en&s;es to deceive us, and repre&s;ent our perceptions as di&s;tinct from our&s;elves, that is as <HI>external</HI> to and <HI>indepen|dent</HI> of us; let us con&s;ider whether they re|ally do &s;o, and whether this error proceeds from an immediate &s;en&s;ation, or from &s;ome other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>TO begin with the que&s;tion concerning <HI>external</HI> exi&s;tence, it may perhaps be &s;aid, that &s;etting a&s;ide the metaphy&s;ical que&s;tion of the identity of a thinking &s;ub&s;tance, our own body evidently belongs to us; and as &s;everal impre&s;&s;ions appear exterior to the body, we &s;uppo&s;e them al&s;o exterior to our|&s;elves. The paper, on which I write at pre&s;ent, is beyond my hand. The table is beyond the paper. The walls of the cham|ber beyond the table. And in ca&s;ting my eye towards the window, I perceive a great extent of fields and buildings beyond my chamber. From all this it may be infer'd, that no other faculty is requir'd, be&s;ide the &s;en&s;es, to convince us of the external exi&s;|tence of body. But to prevent this in|ference, we need only weigh the three
<PB N="334" REF="346">
following con&s;iderations. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That, pro|perly &s;peaking, 'tis not our body we perceive, when we regard our limbs and members, but certain impre&s;&s;ions, which enter by the &s;en&s;es; &s;o that the a&s;cribing a real and cor|poreal exi&s;tence to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, or to their objects, is an act of the mind as diffi|cult to explain, as that which we examine at pre&s;ent. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Sounds, and ta&s;tes, and &s;mells, tho' commonly regarded by the mind as continu'd independent qualities, appear not to have any exi&s;tence in exten&s;ion, and con&s;equently cannot appear to the &s;en&s;es as &s;ituated externally to the body. The rea|&s;on, why we a&s;cribe a place to them, &s;hall be con&s;ider'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE> afterwards. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Even our &s;ight informs us not of di&s;tance or out|ne&s;s (&s;o to &s;peak) immediately and without a certain rea&s;oning and experience, as is ac|knowledg'd by the mo&s;t rational philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>independency</HI> of our perceptions on our&s;elves, this can never be an object of the &s;en&s;es; but any opinion we form con|cerning it, mu&s;t be deriv'd from experience and ob&s;ervation: And we &s;hall &s;ee after|wards, that our conclu&s;ions from experience are far from being favourable to the doctrine of
<PB N="335" REF="347">
the independency of our perceptions. Mean while we may ob&s;erve that when we talk of real di&s;tinct exi&s;tences, we have commonly more in our eye their independency than external &s;ituation in place, and think an object has a &s;ufficient reality, when its Being is uninterrupted, and independent of the in|ce&s;&s;ant revolutions, which we are con&s;cious of in our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THUS to re&s;ume what I have &s;aid con|cerning the &s;en&s;es; they give us no notion of continu'd exi&s;tence, becau&s;e they cannot operate beyond the extent, in which they really operate. They as little produce the opinion of a di&s;tinct exi&s;tence, becau&s;e they neither can offer it to the mind as repre|&s;ented, nor as original. To offer it as re|pre&s;ented, they mu&s;t pre&s;ent both an object and an image. To make it appear as ori|ginal, they mu&s;t convey a fal&s;hood; and this fal&s;hood mu&s;t lie in the relations and &s;ituation: In order to which they mu&s;t be able to compare the object with our&s;elves; and even in that ca&s;e they do not, nor is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hou'd, deceive us. We may, therefore, conclude with certainty, that the opinion of a continu'd and of a di&s;tinct ex|i&s;tence never ari&s;es from the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="348">
TO confirm this we may ob&s;erve, that there are three different kinds of impre&s;&s;ions convey'd by the &s;en&s;es. The fir&s;t are tho&s;e of the figure, bulk, motion and &s;olidity of bodies. The &s;econd tho&s;e of colours, ta&s;tes, &s;mells, &s;ounds, heat and cold. The third are the pains and plea&s;ures, that ari&s;e from the application of objects to our bodies, as by the cutting of our fle&s;h with &s;teel, and &s;uch like. Both philo&s;ophers and the vul|gar &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t of the&s;e to have a di|&s;tinct continu'd exi&s;tence. The vulgar only regard the &s;econd as on the &s;ame footing. Both philo&s;ophers and the vulgar, again, e&s;teem the third to be merely perceptions; and con&s;equently interrupted and dependent beings.</P>
<P>NOW 'tis evident, that, whatever may be our philo&s;ophical opinion, colours, &s;ounds, heat and cold, as far as appears to the &s;en&s;es, exi&s;t after the &s;ame manner with motion and &s;olidity, and that the difference we make betwixt them in this re&s;pect, ari&s;es not from the mere perception. So &s;trong is the prejudice for the di&s;tinct continu'd exi&s;t|ence of the former qualities, that when the contrary opinion is advanc'd by modern phi|lo&s;ophers, people imagine they can almo&s;t refute it from their feeling and experience,
<PB N="337" REF="349">
and that their very &s;en&s;es contradict this philo&s;ophy. 'Tis al&s;o evident, that colours, &s;ounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are originally on the &s;ame foot|ing with the pain that ari&s;es from &s;teel, and plea&s;ure that proceeds from a fire; and that the difference betwixt them is founded nei|ther on perception nor rea&s;on, but on the imagination. For as they are confe&s;t to be, both of them, nothing but perceptions ari&s;ing from the particular configurations and mo|tions of the parts of body, wherein po&s;&s;ibly can their difference con&s;i&s;t? Upon the whole, then, we may conclude, that as far as the &s;en&s;es are judges, all perceptions are the &s;ame in the manner of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o ob&s;erve in this in&s;tance of &s;ounds and colours, that we can attribute a di&s;tinct continu'd exi&s;tence to objects with|out ever con&s;ulting REASON, or weighing our opinions by any philo&s;ophical principles. And indeed, whatever convincing arguments philo&s;ophers may fancy they can produce to e&s;tabli&s;h the belief of objects independent of the mind, 'tis obvious the&s;e arguments are known but to very few, and that 'tis not by them, that children, pea&s;ants, and the greate&s;t part of mankind are induc'd to attribute objects to &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions, and deny them to others. Accordingly we find,
<PB N="338" REF="350">
that all the conclu&s;ions, which the vul|gar form on this head, are directly con|trary to tho&s;e, which are confirm'd by phi|lo&s;ophy. For philo&s;ophy informs us, that every thing, which appears to the mind, is nothing but a perception, and is interrupted, and dependent on the mind; whereas the vulgar confound perceptions and objects, and attribute a di&s;tinct continu'd exi&s;tence to the very things they feel or &s;ee. This &s;entiment, then, as it is entirely unrea&s;on|&s;onable, mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome other fa|culty than the under&s;tanding. To which we may add, that as long as we take our perceptions and objects to be the &s;ame, we can never infer the exi&s;tence of the one from that of the other, nor form any ar|gument from the relation of cau&s;e and ef|fect; which is the only one that can a&s;&s;ure us of matter of fact. Even after we di|&s;tingui&s;h our perceptions from our objects, 'twill appear pre&s;ently, that we are &s;till in|capable of rea&s;oning from the exi&s;tence of one to that of the other: So that upon the whole our rea&s;on neither does, nor is it po&s;|&s;ible it ever &s;hou'd, upon any &s;uppo&s;ition, give us an a&s;&s;urance of the continu'd and di&s;tinct exi&s;tence of body. That opinion mu&s;t be entirely owing to the IMAGINA|TION:
<PB N="339" REF="351">
which mu&s;t now be the &s;ubject of our enquiry.</P>
<P>SINCE all impre&s;&s;ions are internal and peri&s;hing exi&s;tences, and appear as &s;uch, the notion of their di&s;tinct and continu'd exi&s;tence mu&s;t ari&s;e from a concurrence of &s;ome of their qualities with the qualities of the imagination; and &s;ince this notion does not extend to all of them, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from certain qualities peculiar to &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions. 'Twill therefore be ea&s;y for us to di&s;cover the&s;e qualities by a compari&s;on of the impre&s;&s;ions, to which we attribute a di&s;tinct and continu'd exi&s;tence, with tho&s;e, which we regard as internal and peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, then, that 'tis neither upon account of the involuntarine&s;s of cer|tain impre&s;&s;ions, as is commonly &s;uppos'd, nor of their &s;uperior force and violence, that we attribute to them a reality, and con|tinu'd exi&s;tence, which we refu&s;e to others, that are voluntary or feeble. For 'tis evi|dent our pains and plea&s;ures, our pa&s;&s;ions and affections, which we never &s;uppo&s;e to have any exi&s;tence beyond our perception, operate with greater violence, and are equally involuntary, as the impre&s;&s;ions of figure and exten&s;ion, colour and &s;ound, which we &s;up|po&s;e to be permanent beings. The heat of
<PB N="340" REF="352">
a fire, when moderate, is &s;uppos'd to exi&s;t in the fire; but the pain, which it cau&s;es upon a near approach, is not taken to have any being except in the perception.</P>
<P>THESE vulgar opinions, then, being re|jected, we mu&s;t &s;earch for &s;ome other hy|pothe&s;is, by which we may di&s;cover tho&s;e peculiar qualities in our impre&s;&s;ions, which makes us attribute to them a di&s;tinct and continu'd exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>AFTER a little examination, we &s;hall find, that all tho&s;e objects, to which we attribute a continu'd exi&s;tence, have a peculiar <HI>con|&s;tancy,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the impre&s;&s;ions, who&s;e exi&s;tence depends upon our perception. Tho&s;e mountains, and hou&s;es, and trees, which lie at pre&s;ent under my eye, have always appear'd to me in the &s;ame order; and when I lo&s;e &s;ight of them by &s;hutting my eyes or turning my head, I &s;oon after find them return upon me with|out the lea&s;t alteration. My bed and table, my books and papers, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the &s;ame uniform manner, and change not upon account of any interruption in my &s;eeing or perceiving them. This is the ca&s;e with all the impre&s;&s;ions, who&s;e objects are &s;uppos'd to have an external exi&s;tence; and is the ca&s;e
<PB N="341" REF="353">
with no other impre&s;&s;ions, whether gentle or violent, voluntary or involuntary.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;tancy, however, is not &s;o per|fect as not to admit of very con&s;iderable ex|ceptions. Bodies often change their po&s;i|tion and qualities, and after a little ab&s;ence or interruption may become hardly know|able. But here 'tis ob&s;ervable, that even in the&s;e changes they pre&s;erve a <HI>coherence,</HI> and have a regular dependence on each other; which is the foundation of a kind of rea|&s;oning from cau&s;ation, and produces the opinion of their continu'd exi&s;tence. When I return to my chamber after an hour's ab|&s;ence, I find not my fire in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation, in which I left it: But then I am accu&s;tom'd in other in&s;tances to &s;ee a like alteration produc'd in a like time, whether I am pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, near or remote. This coherence, therefore, in their changes is one of the characteri&s;tics of external objects, as well as their con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>HAVING found that the opinion of the continu'd exi&s;tence of body depends on the COHERENCE and CONSTANCY of certain impre&s;&s;ions, I now proceed to examine after what manner the&s;e qualities give ri&s;e to &s;o extraordinary an opinion. To begin with the coherence; we may ob&s;erve,
<PB N="342" REF="354">
that tho' tho&s;e internal impre&s;&s;ions, which we regard as fleeting and peri&s;hing, have al&s;o a certain coherence or regularity in their ap|pearances, yet 'tis of &s;omewhat a different nature, from that which we di&s;cover in bo|dies. Our pa&s;&s;ions are found by experience to have a mutual connexion with and de|pendance on each other; but on no occa|&s;ion is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, that they have exi&s;ted and operated, when they were not perceiv'd, in order to pre&s;erve the &s;ame dependance and connexion, of which we have had experience. The ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with relation to external objects. Tho&s;e require a continu'd exi&s;tence, or otherwi&s;e lo&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, the regularity of their operation. I am here &s;eated in my chamber with my face to the fire; and all the objects, that &s;trike my &s;en&s;es, are con|tain'd in a few yards around me. My me|mory, indeed, informs me of the exi&s;tence of many objects; but then this information extends not beyond their pa&s;t exi&s;tence, nor do either my &s;en&s;es or memory give any te&s;timony to the continuance of their being. When therefore I am thus &s;eated, and revolve over the&s;e thoughts, I hear on a &s;udden a noi&s;e as of a door turning upon its hinges; and a little after &s;ee a porter, who
<PB N="343" REF="355">
advances towards me. This gives occa&s;ion to many new reflections and rea&s;onings. Fir&s;t, I never have ob&s;erv'd, that this noi&s;e cou'd proceed from any thing but the mo|tion of a door; and therefore conclude, that the pre&s;ent phaenomenon is a contradiction to all pa&s;t experience, unle&s;s the door, which I remember on t'other &s;ide the cham|ber, be &s;till in being. Again, I have al|ways found, that a human body was po&s;&s;e&s;t of a quality, which I call gravity, and which hinders it from mounting in the air, as this porter mu&s;t have done to arrive at my chamber, unle&s;s the &s;tairs I remember be not annihilated by my ab&s;ence. But this is not all. I receive a letter, which upon open|ing I perceive by the hand-writing and &s;ub|&s;cription to have come from a friend, who &s;ays he is two hundred leagues di&s;tant. 'Tis evident I can never account for this phae|nomenon, conformable to my experience in other in&s;tances, without &s;preading out in my mind the whole &s;ea and continent between us, and &s;uppo&s;ing the effects and continu'd exi&s;tence of po&s;ts and ferries, according to my memory and ob&s;ervation. To con&s;ider the&s;e phaenomena of the porter and letter in a certain light, they are contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded
<PB N="344" REF="356">
as objections to tho&s;e maxims, which we form concerning the connexions of cau&s;es and effects. I am accu&s;tom'd to hear &s;uch a &s;ound, and &s;ee &s;uch an object in motion at the &s;ame time. I have not receiv'd in this particular in&s;tance both the&s;e perceptions. The&s;e ob&s;ervations are contrary, unle&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e that the door &s;till remains, and that it was open'd without my perceiving it: And this &s;uppo&s;ition, which was at fir&s;t entirely arbitrary and hypothetical, acquires a force and evidence by its being the only one, upon which I can reconcile the&s;e contradictions. There is &s;carce a moment of my life, wherein there is not a &s;imilar in&s;tance pre&s;ented to me, and I have not occa&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e the continu'd exi&s;tence of objects, in order to connect their pa&s;t and pre&s;ent appearances, and give them &s;uch an union with each other, as I have found by experience to be &s;uit|able to their particular natures and circum|&s;tances. Here then I am naturally led to regard the world, as &s;omething real and du|rable, and as pre&s;erving its exi&s;tence, even when it is no longer pre&s;ent to my per|ception.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this conclu&s;ion from the cohe|rence of appearances may &s;eem to be of the &s;ame nature with our rea&s;onings concern|ing
<PB N="345" REF="357">
cau&s;es and effects; as being deriv'd from cu&s;tom, and regulated by pa&s;t experience; we &s;hall find upon examination, that they are at the bottom con&s;iderably different from each other, and that this inference ari&s;es from the under&s;tanding, and from cu&s;tom in an indirect and oblique manner. For 'twill readily be allow'd, that &s;ince nothing is ever really pre&s;ent to the mind, be&s;ides its own perceptions, 'tis not only impo&s;&s;i|ble, that any habit &s;hou'd ever be acquir'd otherwi&s;e than by the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e perceptions, but al&s;o that any habit &s;hou'd ever exceed that degree of regulari|ty. Any degree, therefore, of regularity in our perceptions, can never be a foundation for us to infer a greater degree of regulari|ty in &s;ome objects, which are not perceiv'd; &s;ince this &s;uppo&s;es a contradiction, <HI>viz.</HI> a habit acquir'd by what was never pre&s;ent to the mind. But 'tis evident, that whenever we infer the continu'd exi&s;tence of the ob|jects of &s;en&s;e from their coherence, and the frequency of their union, 'tis in order to be&s;tow on the objects a greater regularity than what is ob&s;erv'd in our mere percep|tions. We remark a connexion betwixt two kinds of objects in their pa&s;t appear|ance to the &s;en&s;es, but are not able to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="346" REF="358">
this connexion to be perfectly con|&s;tant, &s;ince the turning about of our head, or the &s;hutting of our eyes is able to break it. What then do we &s;uppo&s;e in this ca&s;e, but that the&s;e objects &s;till continue their u&s;ual connexion, notwith&s;tanding their apparent in|terruption, and that the irregular appearances are join'd by &s;omething, of which we are in&s;en&s;ible? But as all rea&s;oning concerning matters of fact ari&s;es only from cu&s;tom, and cu&s;tom can only be the effect of repeated perceptions, the extending of cu&s;tom and rea&s;oning beyond the perceptions can never be the direct and natural effect of the con|&s;tant repetition and connexion, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from the co-operation of &s;ome other principles.</P>
<P>I HAVE already <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 4.</NOTE> ob&s;erv'd, in examining the foundation of mathematics, that the imagination, when &s;et into any train of thinking, is apt to continue, even when its object fails it, and like a galley put in mo|tion by the oars, carries on its cour&s;e with|out any new impul&s;e. This I have a&s;&s;ign'd for the rea&s;on, why, after con&s;idering &s;eve|ral loo&s;e &s;tandards of equality, and correct|ing them by each other, we proceed to ima|gine &s;o correct and exact a &s;tandard of that
<PB N="347" REF="359">
relation, as is not liable to the lea&s;t error or variation. The &s;ame principle makes us ea&s;ily entertain this opinion of the con|tinu'd exi&s;tence of body. Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our &s;en&s;es; but this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if we &s;uppo&s;e the objects to have a continu'd exi&s;tence; and as the mind is once in the train of ob|&s;erving an uniformity among objects, it na|turally continues, till it renders the unifor|mity as compleat as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;imple &s;uppo&s;ition of their continu'd exi&s;tence &s;uf|fices for this purpo&s;e, and gives us a notion of a much greater regularity among objects, than what they have when we look no far|ther than our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT whatever force we may a&s;cribe to this principle, I am afraid 'tis too weak to &s;upport alone &s;o va&s;t an edifice, as is that of the continu'd exi&s;tence of all external bodies; and that we mu&s;t join the <HI>con&s;tancy</HI> of their appearance to the <HI>coherence,</HI> in or|der to give a &s;atisfactory account of that o|pinion. As the explication of this will lead me into a con&s;iderable compa&s;s of very pro|found rea&s;oning; I think it proper, in order to avoid confu&s;ion, to give a &s;hort &s;ketch or abridgment of my &s;y&s;tem, and after|wards
<PB N="348" REF="360">
draw out all its parts in their full compa&s;s. This inference from the con&s;tan|cy of our perceptions, like the precedent from their coherence, gives ri&s;e to the opi|nion of the <HI>continu'd</HI> exi&s;tence of body, which is prior to that of its <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> exi&s;t|ence, and produces that latter principle.</P>
<P>WHEN we have been accu&s;tom'd to ob|&s;erve a con&s;tancy in certain impre&s;&s;ions, and have found, that the perception of the &s;un or ocean, for in&s;tance, returns upon us af|ter an ab&s;ence or annihilation with like parts and in a like order, as at its fir&s;t appearance, we are not apt to regard the&s;e interrupted per|ceptions as different, (which they really are) but on the contrary con&s;ider them as indivi|dually the &s;ame, upon account of their re|&s;emblance. But as this interruption of their exi&s;tence is contrary to their perfect identi|ty, and makes us regard the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion as annihilated, and the &s;econd as newly created, we find our&s;elves &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s, and are involv'd in a kind of contradiction. In order to free our&s;elves from this difficul|ty, we di&s;gui&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the interruption, or rather remove it entirely, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the&s;e interrupted percep|tions are connected by a real exi&s;tence, of which we are in&s;en&s;ible. This &s;uppo&s;ition,
<PB N="349" REF="361">
or idea of continu'd exi&s;tence, acquires a force and vivacity from the memory of the&s;e broken impre&s;&s;ions, and from that propen|&s;ity, which they give us, to &s;uppo&s;e them the &s;ame; and according to the precedent rea&s;oning, the very e&s;&s;ence of belief con&s;i&s;ts in the force and vivacity of the conception.</P>
<P>IN order to ju&s;tify this &s;y&s;tem, there are four things requi&s;ite. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To explain the <HI>principium individuationis,</HI> or principle of identity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Give a rea&s;on, why the re&s;emblance of our broken and interrupted perceptions induces us to attribute an identity to them. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Account for that propen|&s;ity, which this illu&s;ion gives, to unite the&s;e broken appearances by a continu'd exi&s;tence. <HI>Fourthly</HI> and la&s;tly, Explain that force and vivacity of conception, which ari&s;es from the propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>FIRST, As to the principle of individua|tion; we may ob&s;erve, that the view of any one object is not &s;ufficient to convey the idea of identity. For in that propo&s;ition, <HI>an object is the &s;ame with it&s;elf,</HI> if the idea expre&s;s'd by the word, <HI>object,</HI> were no ways di&s;tingui&s;h'd from that meant by <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> we really &s;hou'd mean nothing, nor wou'd the propo&s;ition contain a predicate and a &s;ub|ject, which however are imply'd in this
<PB N="350" REF="362">
affirmation. One &s;ingle object conveys the idea of unity, not that of identity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, a multiplicity of ob|jects can never convey this idea, however re|&s;embling they may be &s;uppos'd. The mind always pronounces the one not to be the o|ther, and con&s;iders them as forming two, three, or any determinate number of objects, who&s;e exi&s;tences are entirely di&s;tinct and independent.</P>
<P>SINCE then both number and unity are incompatible with the relation of identity, it mu&s;t lie in &s;omething that is neither of them. But to tell the truth, at fir&s;t &s;ight this &s;eems utterly impo&s;&s;ible. Betwixt uni|ty and number there can be no medium; no more than betwixt exi&s;tence and non|exi&s;tence. After one object is &s;uppos'd to exi&s;t, we mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e another al&s;o to exi&s;t; in which ca&s;e we have the idea of number: Or we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it not to exi&s;t; in which ca&s;e the fir&s;t object remains at unity.</P>
<P>TO remove this difficulty, let us have recour&s;e to the idea of time or duration. I have already ob&s;erv'd,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 5.</NOTE> that time, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, implies &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that when we apply its idea to any unchangeable object,
<PB N="351" REF="363">
'tis only by a fiction of the imagination, by which the unchangeable object is &s;uppos'd to participate of the changes of the co-ex|i&s;tent objects, and in particular of that of our perceptions. This fiction of the imagination almo&s;t univer&s;ally takes place; and 'tis by means of it, that a &s;ingle object, plac'd be|fore us, and &s;urvey'd for any time without our di&s;covering in it any interruption or va|riation, is able to give us a notion of iden|tity. For when we con&s;ider any two points of this time, we may place them in diffe|rent lights: We may either &s;urvey them at the very &s;ame in&s;tant; in which ca&s;e they give us the idea of number, both by them|&s;elves and by the object; which mu&s;t be multiply'd, in order to be conceiv'd at once, as exi&s;tent in the&s;e two different points of time: Or on the other hand, we may trace the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time by a like &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, and conceiving fir&s;t one moment, along with the object then exi&s;tent, imagine afterwards a change in the time without any <HI>variation</HI> or <HI>interruption</HI> in the object; in which ca&s;e it gives us the idea of unity. Here then is an idea, which is a medium betwixt unity and number; or more pro|perly &s;peaking, is either of them, according to the view, in which we take it: And this
<PB N="352" REF="364">
idea we call that of identity. We cannot, in any propriety of &s;peech, &s;ay, that an object is the &s;ame with it&s;elf, unle&s;s we mean, that the object exi&s;tent at one time is the &s;ame with it&s;elf exi&s;tent at another. By this means we make a difference, be|twixt the idea meant by the word, <HI>object,</HI> and that meant by <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> without going the length of number, and at the &s;ame time without re&s;training our&s;elves to a &s;trict and ab&s;olute unity.</P>
<P>THUS the principle of individuation is nothing but the <HI>invariablene&s;s</HI> and <HI>uninter|ruptedne&s;s</HI> of any object, thro' a &s;uppos'd vari|ation of time, by which the mind can trace it in the different periods of its exi&s;tence, without any break of the view, and without being oblig'd to form the idea of multipli|city or number.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to explain the <HI>&s;econd</HI> part of my &s;y&s;tem, and &s;hew why the con|&s;tancy of our perceptions makes us a&s;cribe to them a perfect numerical identity, tho' there be very long intervals betwixt their ap|pearance, and they have only one of the e&s;&s;ential qualities of identity, <HI>viz. invari|ablene&s;s.</HI> That I may avoid all ambiguity and confu&s;ion on this head, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that I here account for the opinions and be|lief
<PB N="353" REF="365">
of the vulgar with regard to the exi&s;|tence of body; and therefore mu&s;t entirely conform my&s;elf to their manner of thinking and of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves. Now we have already ob&s;erv'd, that however philo&s;ophers may di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the objects and per|ceptions of the &s;en&s;es; which they &s;uppo&s;e co-exi&s;tent and re&s;embling; yet this is a di&s;|tinction, which is not comprehended by the generality of mankind, who as they perceive only one being, can never a&s;&s;ent to the opi|nion of a double exi&s;tence and repre&s;enta|tion. Tho&s;e very &s;en&s;ations, which enter by the eye or ear, are with them the true objects, nor can they readily conceive that this pen or paper, which is immediately perceiv'd, repre&s;ents another, which is dif|ferent from, but re&s;embling it. In order, therefore, to accommodate my&s;elf to their notions, I &s;hall at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e; that there is only a &s;ingle exi&s;tence, which I &s;hall call indifferently <HI>object</HI> or <HI>perception,</HI> according as it &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t to &s;uit my purpo&s;e, un|der&s;tanding by both of them what any com|mon man means by a hat, or &s;hoe, or &s;tone, or any other impre&s;&s;ion, convey'd to him by his &s;en&s;es. I &s;hall be &s;ure to give warn|ing, when I return to a more philo&s;ophical way of &s;peaking and thinking.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="366">
TO enter, therefore, upon the que&s;tion concerning the &s;ource of the error and de|ception with regard to identity, when we attribute it to our re&s;embling perceptions, notwith&s;tanding their interruption; I mu&s;t here recal an ob&s;ervation, which I have al|ready prov'd and explain'd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 5.</NOTE>. Nothing is more apt to make us mi&s;take one idea for another, than any relation betwixt them, which a&s;&s;ociates them together in the ima|gination, and makes it pa&s;s with facility from one to the other. Of all relations, that of re&s;emblance is in this re&s;pect the mo&s;t effi|cacious; and that becau&s;e it not only cau&s;es an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, but al&s;o of di&s;po&s;i|tions, and makes us conceive the one idea by an act or operation of the mind, &s;imilar to that by which we conceive the other. This circum&s;tance I have ob&s;erv'd to be of great moment; and we may e&s;tabli&s;h it for a general rule, that whatever ideas place the mind in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition or in &s;imilar ones, are very apt to be confounded. The mind readily pa&s;&s;es from one to the other, and perceives not the change without a &s;trict attention, of which, generally &s;peaking, 'tis wholly incapable.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="367">
IN order to apply this general maxim, we mu&s;t fir&s;t examine the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind in viewing any object which pre&s;erves a perfect identity, and then find &s;ome other object, that is confounded with it, by cau&s;|ing a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition. When we fix our thought on any object, and &s;uppo&s;e it to continue the &s;ame for &s;ome time; 'tis evi|dent we &s;uppo&s;e the change to lie only in the time, and never exert our&s;elves to pro|duce any new image or idea of the object. The faculties of the mind repo&s;e them&s;elves in a manner, and take no more exerci&s;e, than what is nece&s;&s;ary to continue that idea, of which we were formerly po&s;&s;e&s;t, and which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts without variation or interruption. The pa&s;&s;age from one moment to another is &s;carce felt, and di&s;tingui&s;hes not it&s;elf by a different perception or idea, which may re|quire a different direction of the &s;pirits, in order to its conception.</P>
<P>NOW what other objects, be&s;ide identical ones, are capable of placing the mind in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, when it con&s;iders them, and of cau&s;ing the &s;ame uninterrupted pa&s;|&s;age of the imagination from one idea to another? This que&s;tion is of the la&s;t im|portance. For if we can find any &s;uch ob|jects, we may certainly conclude, from the
<PB N="356" REF="368">
foregoing principle, that they are very na|turally confounded with identical ones, and are taken for them in mo&s;t of our rea|&s;onings. But tho' this que&s;tion be very im|portant, 'tis not very difficult nor doubtful. For I immediately reply, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related objects places the mind in this di&s;po&s;ition, and is con&s;ider'd with the &s;ame &s;mooth and uninterrupted progre&s;s of the imagination, as attends the view of the &s;ame invariable object. The very nature and e&s;|&s;ence of relation is to connect our ideas with each other, and upon the appearance of one, to facilitate the tran&s;ition to its cor|relative. The pa&s;&s;age betwixt related ideas is, therefore, &s;o &s;mooth and ea&s;y, that it produces little alteration on the mind, and &s;eems like the continuation of the &s;ame ac|tion; and as the continuation of the &s;ame action is an effect of the continu'd view of the &s;ame object, 'tis for this rea&s;on we at|tribute &s;amene&s;s to every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of re|lated objects. The thought &s;lides along the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with equal facility, as if it con|&s;ider'd only one object; and therefore con|founds the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with the identity.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall afterwards &s;ee many in&s;tances of this tendency of relation to make us a&s;cribe an <HI>identity</HI> to <HI>different</HI> objects; but &s;hall here
<PB N="357" REF="369">
confine our&s;elves to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. We find by experience, that there is &s;uch a <HI>con|&s;tancy</HI> in almo&s;t all the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es, that their interruption produces no alteration on them, and hinders them not from returning the &s;ame in appearance and in &s;ituation as at their fir&s;t exi&s;tence. I &s;urvey the furniture of my chamber; I &s;hut my eyes, and afterwards open them; and find the new perceptions to re&s;emble per|fectly tho&s;e, which formerly &s;truck my &s;en|&s;es. This re&s;emblance is ob&s;erv'd in a thou|&s;and in&s;tances, and naturally connects to|gether our ideas of the&s;e interrupted per|ceptions by the &s;tronge&s;t relation, and con|veys the mind with an ea&s;y tran&s;ition from one to another. An ea&s;y tran&s;ition or pa&s;|&s;age of the imagination, along the ideas of the&s;e different and interrupted perceptions, is almo&s;t the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of mind with that in which we con&s;ider one con&s;tant and uninterrupted perception. 'Tis therefore very natural for us to mi&s;take the one for the other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rea&s;oning, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, is &s;omewhat ab|&s;tru&s;e, and difficult to be comprehended; but it is remarkable, that this very difficulty may be converted into a proof of the rea&s;oning. We may ob&s;erve, that there are two relations, and both of them re&s;emblances, which contribute to our mi&s;taking the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our interrupted perceptions for an identical object. The fir&s;t is, the re&s;emblance of the perceptions: The &s;econd is the re&s;emblance, which the act of the mind in &s;urveying a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of re&s;embling objects bears to that in &s;urveying an identical object. Now the&s;e re&s;emblances we are apt to confound with each other; and 'tis natural we &s;hou'd, according to this very rea&s;oning. But let us keep them di&s;tinct, and we &s;hall find no diffi|culty in conceiving the precedent argument.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="370">
THE per&s;ons, who entertain this opinion concerning the identity of our re&s;embling perceptions, are in general all the unthinking and unphilo&s;ophical part of mankind, (that is, all of us, at one time or other) and con&s;e|quently &s;uch as &s;uppo&s;e their perceptions to be their only objects, and never think of a double exi&s;tence internal and external, re|pre&s;enting and repre&s;ented. The very image, which is pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es, is with us the real body; and 'tis to the&s;e interrupted images we a&s;cribe a perfect identity. But as the interruption of the appearance &s;eems contrary to the identity, and naturally leads us to regard the&s;e re&s;embling perceptions as different from each other, we here find our|&s;elves at a lo&s;s how to reconcile &s;uch oppo|&s;ite opinions. The &s;mooth pa&s;&s;age of the imagination along the ideas of the re&s;em|bling perceptions makes us a&s;cribe to them a perfect identity. The interrupted manner
<PB N="359" REF="371">
of their appearance makes us con&s;ider them as &s;o many re&s;embling, but &s;till di&s;tinct be|ings, which appear after certain intervals. The perplexity ari&s;ing from this contradic|tion produces a propen&s;ion to unite the&s;e broken appearances by the fiction of a con|tinu'd exi&s;tence, which is the <HI>third</HI> part of that hypothe&s;is I propos'd to explain.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain from expe|rience, than that any contradiction either to the &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions gives a &s;en&s;ible un|ea&s;ine&s;s, whether it proceeds from without or from within; from the oppo&s;ition of ex|ternal objects, or from the combat of in|ternal principles. On the contrary, what|ever &s;trikes in with the natural propen&s;ities, and either externally forwards their &s;ati&s;|faction, or internally concurs with their movements, is &s;ure to give a &s;en&s;ible plea|&s;ure. Now there being here an oppo&s;ition betwixt the notion of the identity of re|&s;embling perceptions, and the interruption of their appearance, the mind mu&s;t be un|ea&s;y in that &s;ituation, and will naturally &s;eek relief from the unea&s;ine&s;s. Since the un|ea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from the oppo&s;ition of two contrary principles, it mu&s;t look for relief by &s;acrificing the one to the other. But as the &s;mooth pa&s;&s;age of our thought along
<PB N="360" REF="372">
our re&s;embling perceptions makes us a|&s;cribe to them an identity, we can never without reluctance yield up that opinion. We mu&s;t, therefore, turn to the other &s;ide, and &s;uppo&s;e that our perceptions are no longer interrupted, but pre&s;erve a continu'd as well as an invariable exi&s;tence, and are by that means entirely the &s;ame. But here the in|terruptions in the appearance of the&s;e per|ceptions are &s;o long and frequent, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to overlook them; and as the <HI>appearance</HI> of a perception in the mind and its <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight entirely the &s;ame, it may be doubted, whether we can ever a&s;&s;ent to &s;o palpable a contradiction, and &s;uppo&s;e a perception to exi&s;t without being pre&s;ent to the mind. In order to clear up this matter, and learn how the in|terruption in the appearance of a perception implies not nece&s;&s;arily an interruption in its exi&s;tence, 'twill be proper to touch upon &s;ome principles, which we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to explain more fully afterwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE may begin with ob&s;erving, that the difficulty in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e is not concern|ing the matter of fact, or whether the mind forms &s;uch a conclu&s;ion concerning the continu'd exi&s;tence of its perceptions, but
<PB N="361" REF="373">
only concerning the manner in which the conclu&s;ion is form'd, and principles from which it is deriv'd. 'Tis certain, that al|mo&s;t all mankind, and even philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, for the greate&s;t part of their lives, take their perceptions to be their only objects, and &s;uppo&s;e, that the very being, which is intimately pre&s;ent to the mind, is the real body or material exi&s;tence. 'Tis al&s;o certain, that this very perception or ob|ject is &s;uppos'd to have a continu'd unin|terrupted being, and neither to be annihi|lated by our ab&s;ence, nor to be brought in|to exi&s;tence by our pre&s;ence. When we are ab&s;ent from it, we &s;ay it &s;till exi&s;ts, but that we do not feel, we do not &s;ee it. When we are pre&s;ent, we &s;ay we feel, or &s;ee it. Here then may ari&s;e two que&s;tions; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How we can &s;atisfy our&s;elves in &s;up|po&s;ing a perception to be ab&s;ent from the mind without being annihilated. <HI>Secondly,</HI> After what manner we conceive an object to become pre&s;ent to the mind, without &s;ome new creation of a perception or image; and what we mean by this <HI>&s;eeing,</HI> and <HI>feeling,</HI> and <HI>perceiving.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t que&s;tion; we may ob|&s;erve, that what we call a <HI>mind,</HI> is nothing but a heap or collection of different percep|tions,
<PB N="362" REF="374">
united together by certain relations, and &s;uppos'd, tho' fal&s;ely, to be endow'd with a perfect &s;implicity and identity. Now as every perception is di&s;tingui&s;hable from an|other, and may be con&s;ider'd as &s;eparately exi&s;tent; it evidently follows, that there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;eparating any particular per|ception from the mind; that is, in breaking off all its relations, with that connected ma&s;s of perceptions, which con&s;titute a thinking being.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;oning affords us an an|&s;wer to the &s;econd que&s;tion. If the name of <HI>perception</HI> renders not this &s;eparation from a mind ab&s;urd and contradictory, the name of <HI>object,</HI> &s;tanding for the very &s;ame thing, can never render their conjunction impo&s;&s;ible. External objects are &s;een, and felt, and become pre&s;ent to the mind; that is, they acquire &s;uch a relation to a con|nected heap of perceptions, as to influence them very con&s;iderably in augmenting their number by pre&s;ent reflections and pa&s;&s;ions, and in &s;toring the memory with ideas. The &s;ame continu'd and uninterrupted Being may, therefore, be &s;ometimes pre&s;ent to the mind, and &s;ometimes ab&s;ent from it, without any real or e&s;&s;ential change in the Being it&s;elf. An interrupted appearance to the &s;en&s;es im|plies
<PB N="363" REF="375">
not nece&s;&s;arily an interruption in the exi&s;tence. The &s;uppo&s;ition of the continu'd exi&s;tence of &s;en&s;ible objects or perceptions involves no contradiction. We may ea&s;ily indulge our inclination to that &s;uppo&s;ition. When the exact re&s;emblance of our percep|tions makes us a&s;cribe to them an identity, we may remove the &s;eeming interruption by feigning a continu'd being, which may fill tho&s;e intervals, and pre&s;erve a perfect and entire identity to our perceptions.</P>
<P>BUT as we here not only <HI>feign</HI> but <HI>be|lieve</HI> this continu'd exi&s;tence, the que&s;tion is, <HI>from whence ari&s;es &s;uch a belief;</HI> and this que&s;tion leads us to the <HI>fourth</HI> member of this &s;y&s;tem. It has been prov'd already, that belief in general con&s;i&s;ts in nothing, but the vivacity of an idea; and that an idea may acquire this vivacity by its relation to &s;ome pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. Impre&s;&s;ions are naturally the mo&s;t vivid perceptions of the mind; and this quality is in part convey'd by the rela|tion to every connected idea. The relation cau&s;es a &s;mooth pa&s;&s;age from the impre&s;|&s;ion to the idea, and even gives a propen|&s;ity to that pa&s;&s;age. The mind falls &s;o ea&s;i|ly from the one perception to the other, that it &s;carce perceives the change, but retains in the &s;econd a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the viva|city
<PB N="364" REF="376">
of the fir&s;t. It is excited by the live|ly impre&s;&s;ion; and this vivacity is convey'd to the related idea, without any great di|minution in the pa&s;&s;age, by rea&s;on of the &s;mooth tran&s;ition and the propen&s;ity of the imagination.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, that this propen&s;ity ari&s;es from &s;ome other principle, be&s;ides that of relation; 'tis evident it mu&s;t &s;till have the &s;ame effect, and convey the vivacity from the impre&s;&s;ion to the idea. Now this is ex|actly the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Our memory pre|&s;ents us with a va&s;t number of in&s;tances of perceptions perfectly re&s;embling each o|ther, that return at different di&s;tances of time, and after con&s;iderable interruptions. This re&s;emblance gives us a propen&s;ion to con&s;ider the&s;e interrupted perceptions as the &s;ame; and al&s;o a propen&s;ion to connect them by a continu'd exi&s;tence, in order to ju&s;tify this identity, and avoid the contradiction, in which the interrupted appearance of the&s;e perceptions &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to involve us. Here then we have a propen&s;ity to feign the continu'd exi&s;tence of all &s;en&s;ible ob|jects; and as this propen&s;ity ari&s;es from &s;ome lively impre&s;&s;ions of the memory, it be&s;tows a vivacity on that fiction; or in other words, makes us believe the continu'd exi&s;tence of
<PB N="365" REF="377">
body. If &s;ometimes we a&s;cribe a continu'd exi&s;tence to objects, which are perfectly new to us, and of who&s;e con&s;tancy and coherence we have no experience, 'tis becau&s;e the man|ner, in which they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our &s;en&s;es, re&s;embles that of con&s;tant and coherent objects; and this re&s;emblance is a &s;ource of rea&s;oning and analogy, and leads us to attribute the &s;ame qualities to the &s;imilar objects.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE an intelligent reader will find le&s;s difficulty to a&s;&s;ent to this &s;y&s;tem, than to comprehend it fully and di&s;tinctly, and will allow, after a little reflection, that every part carries its own proof along with it. 'Tis indeed evident, that as the vulgar <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> their perceptions to be their only ob|jects, and at the &s;ame time <HI>believe</HI> the con|tinu'd exi&s;tence of matter, we mu&s;t account for the origin of the belief upon that &s;up|po&s;ition. Now upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, 'tis a fal&s;e opinion that any of our objects, or perceptions, are identically the &s;ame after an interruption; and con&s;equently the opinion of their identity can never ari&s;e from rea&s;on, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from the imagination. The imagination is &s;educ'd into &s;uch an opinion only by means of the re&s;emblance of certain perceptions; &s;ince we find they are only our
<PB N="366" REF="378">
re&s;embling perceptions, which we have a propen&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame. This pro|pen&s;ion to be&s;tow an identity on our re|&s;embling perceptions, produces the fiction of a continu'd exi&s;tence; &s;ince that fiction, as well as the identity, is really fal&s;e, as is ac|knowledg'd by all philo&s;ophers, and has no other effect than to remedy the interruption of our perceptions, which is the only cir|cum&s;tance that is contrary to their identity. In the la&s;t place this propen&s;ion cau&s;es be|lief by means of the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions of the memory; &s;ince without the remembrance of former &s;en&s;ations, 'tis plain we never &s;hou'd have any belief of the continu'd ex|i&s;tence of body. Thus in examining all the&s;e parts, we find that each of them is &s;upported by the &s;tronge&s;t proofs; and that all of them together form a con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem, which is perfectly convincing. A &s;trong propen&s;ity or inclination alone, without any pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion, will &s;ometimes cau&s;e a belief or opinion. How much more when aided by that circum&s;tance?</P>
<P>BUT tho' we are led after this manner, by the natural propen&s;ity of the imagination, to a&s;cribe a continu'd exi&s;tence to tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ible objects or perceptions, which we find to re&s;emble each other in their interrupted
<PB N="367" REF="379">
appearance; yet a very little reflection and philo&s;ophy is &s;ufficient to make us perceive the fallacy of that opinion. I have already ob&s;erv'd, that there is an intimate connexion betwixt tho&s;e two principles, of a <HI>continu'd</HI> and of a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> or <HI>independent</HI> exi&s;tence, and that we no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;h the one than the other follows, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. 'Tis the opinion of a continu'd exi&s;tence, which fir&s;t takes place, and without much &s;tudy or reflection draws the other along with it, wherever the mind follows its fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural tendency. But when we compare experiments, and rea&s;on a little upon them, we quickly perceive, that the doctrine of the independent exi&s;tence of our &s;en&s;ible perceptions is contrary to the plaine&s;t experience. This leads us backward upon our foot&s;teps to perceive our error in attributing a continu'd exi&s;tence to our per|ceptions, and is the origin of many very curious opinions, which we &s;hall here en|deavour to account for.</P>
<P>'TWILL fir&s;t be proper to ob&s;erve a few of tho&s;e experiments, which convince us, that our perceptions are not po&s;&s;e&s;t of any independent exi&s;tence. When we pre&s;s one eye with a finger, we immediately perceive all the objects to become double,
<PB N="368" REF="380">
and one half of them to be remov'd from their common and natural po&s;ition. But as we do not attribute a continu'd exi&s;tence to both the&s;e perceptions, and as they are both of the &s;ame nature, we clearly per|ceive, that all our perceptions are dependent on our organs, and the di&s;po&s;ition of our nerves and animal &s;pirits. This opinion is confirm'd by the &s;eeming encrea&s;e and diminution of objects, according to their di&s;tance; by the apparent alterations in their figure; by the changes in their colour and other qualities from our &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;|tempers; and by an infinite number of o|ther experiments of the &s;ame kind; from all which we learn, that our &s;en&s;ible per|ceptions are not po&s;&s;e&s;t of any di&s;tinct or independent exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE natural con&s;equence of this rea|&s;oning &s;hou'd be, that our perceptions have no more a continu'd than an independent exi&s;tence; and indeed philo&s;ophers have &s;o far run into this opinion, that they change their &s;y&s;tem, and di&s;tingui&s;h, (as we &s;hall do for the future) betwixt perceptions and objects, of which the former are &s;uppos'd to be interrupted, and peri&s;hing, and different at every different return; the latter to be uninterrupted, and to pre&s;erve a continu'd
<PB N="369" REF="381">
exi&s;tence and identity. But however phi|lo&s;ophical this new &s;y&s;tem may be e&s;teem'd, I a&s;&s;ert that 'tis only a palliative remedy, and that it contains all the difficulties of the vulgar &s;y&s;tem, with &s;ome others, that are peculiar to it&s;elf. There are no princi|ples either of the under&s;tanding or fan|cy, which lead us directly to embrace this opinion of the double exi&s;tence of per|ceptions and objects, nor can we arrive at it but by pa&s;&s;ing thro' the common hypo|the&s;is of the identity and continuance of our interrupted perceptions. Were we not fir&s;t per&s;waded, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exi&s;t even when they no longer make their appearance to the &s;en&s;es, we &s;hou'd never be led to think, that our perceptions and objects are different, and that our objects alone pre&s;erve a continu'd exi&s;tence. <Q>The latter hypothe&s;is has no primary recommendation either to rea&s;on or the imagination, but acquires all its influence on the imagination from the former.</Q> This propo&s;ition contains two parts, which we &s;hall endeavour to prove as di&s;tinctly and clearly, as &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects will permit.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t part of the propo&s;ition, <HI>that this philo&s;ophical hypothe&s;is has no pri|mary</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="382">
<HI>recommendation, either to rea&s;on or the imagination,</HI> we may &s;oon &s;atisfy our&s;elves with regard to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> by the following reflections. The only exi&s;tences, of which we are certain, are perceptions, which being immediately pre&s;ent to us by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, command our &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;ent, and are the fir&s;t foundation of all our conclu&s;ions. The only conclu&s;ion we can draw from the ex|i&s;tence of one thing to that of another, is by means of the relation of cau&s;e and effect, which &s;hews, that there is a connexion be|twixt them, and that the exi&s;tence of one is dependent on that of the other. The idea of this relation is deriv'd from pa&s;t ex|perience, by which we find, that two beings are con&s;tantly conjoin'd together, and are always pre&s;ent at once to the mind. But as no beings are ever pre&s;ent to the mind but perceptions; it follows that we may ob|&s;erve a conjunction or a relation of cau&s;e and effect between different perceptions, but can never ob&s;erve it between percep|tions and objects. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, there|fore, that from the exi&s;tence or any of the qualities of the former, we can ever form any conclu&s;ion concerning the exi&s;tence of the latter, or ever &s;atisfy our rea&s;on in this particular.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="383">
'TIS no le&s;s certain, that this philo&s;ophi|cal &s;y&s;tem has no primary recommendation to the <HI>imagination,</HI> and that that faculty wou'd never, of it&s;elf, and by its original tendency, have fallen upon &s;uch a principle. I confe&s;s it will be &s;omewhat difficult to prove this to the full &s;atisfaction of the reader; becau&s;e it implies a negative, which in many ca&s;es will not admit of any po&s;itive proof. If any one wou'd take the pains to examine this que&s;tion, and wou'd invent a &s;y&s;tem, to account for the direct origin of this opi|nion from the imagination, we &s;hou'd be able, by the examination of that &s;y&s;tem, to pronounce a certain judgment in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Let it be taken for granted, that our perceptions are broken, and interrupted, and however like, are &s;till different from each other; and let any one upon this &s;up|po&s;ition &s;hew why the fancy, directly and immediately, proceeds to the belief of an|other exi&s;tence, re&s;embling the&s;e perceptions in their nature, but yet continu'd, and un|interrupted, and identical; and after he has done this to my &s;atisfaction, I promi&s;e to renounce my pre&s;ent opinion. Mean while I cannot forbear concluding, from the very ab&s;tractedne&s;s and difficulty of the fir&s;t &s;up|po&s;ition, that 'tis an improper &s;ubject for
<PB N="372" REF="384">
the fancy to work upon. Whoever wou'd explain the origin of the <HI>common</HI> opinion concerning the continu'd and di&s;tinct exi&s;|tence of body, mu&s;t take the mind in its <HI>common</HI> &s;ituation, and mu&s;t proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exi&s;t even when they are not perceiv'd. Tho' this opinion be fal&s;e, 'tis the mo&s;t natural of any, and has alone any primary recommendation to the fancy.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;econd part of the propo&s;ition, <HI>that the philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem acquires all its influence on the imagination from the vulgar one;</HI> we may ob&s;erve, that this is a na|tural and unavoidable con&s;equence of the foregoing conclu&s;ion, <HI>that it has no primary recommendation to rea&s;on or the imagination.</HI> For as the philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem is found by experience to take hold of many minds, and in particular of all tho&s;e, who reflect ever &s;o little on this &s;ubject, it mu&s;t derive all its authority from the vulgar &s;y&s;tem; &s;ince it has no original authority of its own. The manner, in which the&s;e two &s;y&s;tems, tho' directly contrary, are connected together, may be explain'd, as follows.</P>
<P>THE imagination naturally runs on in this train of thinking. Our perceptions are
<PB N="373" REF="385">
our only objects: Re&s;embling perceptions are the &s;ame, however broken or uninterrupted in their appearance: This appearing inter|ruption is contrary to the identity: The interruption con&s;equently extends not be|yond the appearance, and the perception or object really continues to exi&s;t, even when ab&s;ent from us: Our &s;en&s;ible perceptions have, therefore, a continu'd and uninterrupted exi&s;tence. But as a little reflection de&s;troys this conclu&s;ion, that our perceptions have a continu'd exi&s;tence, by &s;hewing that they have a dependent one, 'twou'd naturally be expected, that we mu&s;t altogether reject the opinion, that there is &s;uch a thing in nature as a continu'd exi&s;tence, which is pre&s;erv'd even when it no longer appears to the &s;en&s;es. The ca&s;e, however, is otherwi&s;e. Philo&s;o|phers are &s;o far from rejecting the opinion of a continu'd exi&s;tence upon rejecting that of the independence and continuance of our &s;en&s;ible perceptions, that tho' all &s;ects agree in the latter &s;entiment, the former, which is, in a manner, its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, has been peculiar to a few extravagant &s;cep|tics; who after all maintain'd that opinion in words only, and were never able to bring them&s;elves &s;incerely to believe it.</P>

THERE is a great difference betwixt &s;uch opinions as we form after a calm and pro|found reflection, and &s;uch as we embrace by a kind of in&s;tinct or natural impul&s;e, on account of their &s;uitablene&s;s and conformity to the mind. If the&s;e opinions become con|trary, 'tis not difficult to fore&s;ee which of them will have the advantage. As long as our attention is bent upon the &s;ubject, the philo&s;ophical and &s;tudy'd principle may pre|vail; but the moment we relax our thoughts, nature will di&s;play her&s;elf, and draw us back to our former opinion. Nay &s;he has &s;ome|times &s;uch an influence, that &s;he can &s;top our progre&s;s, even in the mid&s;t of our mo&s;t pro|found reflections, and keep us from run|ning on with all the con&s;equences of any philo&s;ophical opinion. Thus tho' we clear|ly perceive the dependence and interruption of our perceptions, we &s;top &s;hort in our car|reer, and never upon that account reject the notion of an independent and continu'd exi&s;tence. That opinion has taken &s;uch deep root in the imagination, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible ever to eradicate it, nor will any &s;train'd metaphy&s;ical conviction of the dependence of our perceptions be &s;ufficient for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="387">
BUT tho' our natural and obvious prin|ciples here prevail above our &s;tudy'd reflec|tions, 'tis certain there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;truggle and oppo&s;ition in the ca&s;e; at lea&s;t &s;o long as the&s;e reflections retain any force or vi|vacity. In order to &s;et our&s;elves at ea&s;e in this particular, we contrive a new hypothe&s;is, which &s;eems to comprehend both the&s;e prin|ciples of rea&s;on and imagination. This hy|pothe&s;is is the philo&s;ophical one of the double exi&s;tence of perceptions and objects; which plea&s;es our rea&s;on, in allowing, that our de|pendent perceptions are interrupted and dif|ferent; and at the &s;ame time is agreeable to the imagination, in attributing a continu'd exi&s;tence to &s;omething el&s;e, which we call <HI>objects.</HI> This philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem, therefore, is the mon&s;trous offspring of two principles, which are contrary to each other, which are both at once embrac'd by the mind, and which are unable mutually to de&s;troy each other. The imagination tells us, that our re&s;embling perceptions have a continu'd and uninterrupted exi&s;tence, and are not an|nihilated by their ab&s;ence. Reflection tells us, that even our re&s;embling perceptions are interrupted in their exi&s;tence, and different from each other. The contradiction betwixt the&s;e opinions we elude by a new fiction,
<PB N="376" REF="388">
which is conformable to the hypothe&s;es both of reflection and fancy, by a&s;cribing the&s;e contrary qualities to different exi&s;tences; the <HI>interruption</HI> to perceptions, and the <HI>continu|ance</HI> to objects. Nature is ob&s;tinate, and will not quit the field, however &s;trongly attack'd by rea&s;on; and at the &s;ame time rea&s;on is &s;o clear in the point, that there is no po&s;&s;i|bility of di&s;gui&s;ing her. Not being able to reconcile the&s;e two enemies, we endea|vour to &s;et our&s;elves at ea&s;e as much as po&s;|&s;ible, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ively granting to each what|ever it demands, and by feigning a double exi&s;tence, where each may find &s;omething, that has all the conditions it de&s;ires. Were we fully convinc'd, that our re&s;embling per|ceptions are continu'd, and identical, and in|dependent, we &s;hou'd never run into this opinion of a double exi&s;tence; &s;ince we &s;hou'd find &s;atisfaction in our fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, and wou'd not look beyond. Again, were we fully convinc'd, that our perceptions are de|pendent, and interrupted, and different, we &s;hou'd be as little inclin'd to embrace the opinion of a double exi&s;tence; &s;ince in that ca&s;e we &s;hou'd clearly perceive the error of our fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition of a continu'd exi&s;tence, and wou'd never regard it any farther. 'Tis therefore from the intermediate &s;ituation of
<PB N="377" REF="389">
the mind, that this opinion ari&s;es, and from &s;uch an adherence to the&s;e two contrary principles, as makes us &s;eek &s;ome pretext to ju&s;tify our receiving both; which happi|ly at la&s;t is found in the &s;y&s;tem of a double exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage of this philo&s;ophi|cal &s;y&s;tem is its &s;imilarity to the vulgar one; by which means we can humour our rea|&s;on for a moment, when it becomes trou|ble&s;ome and &s;ollicitous; and yet upon its lea&s;t negligence or inattention, can ea&s;ily return to our vulgar and natural notions. Accordingly we find, that philo&s;ophers neg|lect not this advantage; but immediately upon leaving their clo&s;ets, mingle with the re&s;t of manking in tho&s;e exploded opinions, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue identically and uninterrupted|ly the &s;ame in all their interrupted appear|ances.</P>
<P>THERE are other particulars of this &s;y&s;tem, wherein we may remark its depen|dence on the fancy, in a very con&s;picuous manner. Of the&s;e, I &s;hall ob&s;erve the two following. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We &s;uppo&s;e external ob|jects to re&s;emble internal perceptions. I have already &s;hewn, that the relation of cau&s;e and effect can never afford us any
<PB N="378" REF="390">
ju&s;t conclu&s;ion from the exi&s;tence or quali|ties of our perceptions to the exi&s;tence of external continu'd objects: And I &s;hall far|ther add, that even tho' they cou'd afford &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, we &s;hou'd never have any rea&s;on to infer, that our objects re&s;em|ble our perceptions. That opinion, there|fore, is deriv'd from nothing but the qua|lity of the fancy above-explain'd, <HI>that it borrows all its ideas from &s;ome preccdent per|ception.</HI> We never can conceive any thing but perceptions, and therefore mu&s;t make every thing re&s;emble them.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, As we &s;uppo&s;e our objects in general to re&s;emble our perceptions, &s;o we take it for granted, that every particular ob|ject re&s;embles that perception, which it cau&s;es. The relation of cau&s;e and effect determines us to join the other of re&s;emblance; and the ideas of the&s;e exi&s;tences being already united together in the fancy by the former relation, we naturally add the latter to com|pleat the union. We have a &s;trong pro|pen&s;ity to compleat every union by joining new relations to tho&s;e which we have be|fore ob&s;erv'd betwixt any ideas, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve pre&s;ently <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="391">
HAVING thus given an account of all the &s;y&s;tems both popular and philo&s;ophical, with regard to external exi&s;tences, I cannot forbear giving vent to a certain &s;entiment, which ari&s;es upon reviewing tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems. I begun this &s;ubject with premi&s;ing, that we ought to have an implicit faith in our &s;en&s;es, and that this wou'd be the conlu|&s;ion, I &s;hou'd draw from the whole of my rea&s;oning. But to be ingenuous, I feel my|&s;elf <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> of a quite contrary &s;entiment, and am more inclin'd to repo&s;e no faith at all in my &s;en&s;es, or rather imagination, than to place in it &s;uch an implicit confidence. I cannot conceive how &s;uch trivial qualities of the fancy, conducted by &s;uch fal&s;e &s;up|po&s;itions, can ever lead to any &s;olid and rational &s;y&s;tem. They are the coherence and con&s;tancy of our perceptions, which produce the opinion of their continu'd exi&s;|tence; tho' the&s;e qualities of perceptions have no perceivable connexion with &s;uch an exi&s;tence. The con&s;tancy of our per|ceptions has the mo&s;t con&s;iderable effect, and yet is attended with the greate&s;t diffi|culties. 'Tis a gro&s;s illu&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e, that our re&s;embling perceptions are nume|rically the &s;ame; and 'tis this illu&s;ion, which leads us into the opinion, that the&s;e per|ceptions
<PB N="380" REF="392">
are uninterrupted, and are &s;till ex|i&s;tent, even when they are not pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es. This is the ca&s;e with our po|pular &s;y&s;tem. And as to our philo&s;ophical one, 'tis liable to the &s;ame difficulties; and is over-and-above loaded with this ab&s;urdi|ty, that it at once denies and e&s;tabli&s;hes the vulgar &s;uppo&s;ition. Philo&s;ophers deny our re&s;embling perceptions to be identically the &s;ame, and uninterrupted; and yet have &s;o great a propen&s;ity to believe them &s;uch, that they arbitrarily invent a new &s;et of percep|tions, to which they attribute the&s;e quali|ties. I &s;ay, a new &s;et of perceptions: For we may well &s;uppo&s;e in general, but 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for us di&s;tinctly to conceive, objects to be in their nature any thing but exactly the &s;ame with perceptions. What then can we look for from this confu&s;ion of ground|le&s;s and extraordinary opinions but error and fal&s;hood? And how can we ju&s;tify to our&s;elves any belief we repo&s;e in them?</P>
<P>THIS &s;ceptical doubt, both with re&s;pect to rea&s;on and the &s;en&s;es, is a malady, which can never be radically cur'd, but mu&s;t re|turn upon us every moment, however we may chace it away, and &s;ometimes may &s;eem entirely free from it. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible upon any &s;y&s;tem to defend either our un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="381" REF="393">
or &s;en&s;es; and we but expo&s;e them farther when we endeavour to ju&s;tify them in that manner. As the &s;ceptical doubt ari&s;es naturally from a profound and inten&s;e reflection on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, it al|ways encrea&s;es, the farther we carry our re|flections, whether in oppo&s;ition or confor|mity to it. Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and in-attention a|lone can afford us any remedy. For this rea&s;on I rely entirely upon them; and take it for granted, whatever may be the reader's opinion at this pre&s;ent moment, that an hour hence he will be per&s;uaded there is both an external and internal world; and going upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, I intend to examine &s;ome general &s;y&s;tems both ancient and modern, which have been propos'd of both, before I proceed to a more particular enquiry concerning our impre&s;&s;ions. This will not, perhaps, in the end be found fo|reign to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. <HI>Of the antient philo&s;ophy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL morali&s;ts have recommended it as an excellent method of becoming acquainted with our own hearts, and know|ing our progre&s;s in virtue, to recollect our dreams in a morning, and examine them with the &s;ame rigour, that we wou'd our mo&s;t &s;erious and mo&s;t deliberate actions. Our character is the &s;ame throughout, &s;ay they, and appears be&s;t where artifice, fear, and policy have no place, and men can neither be hypocrites with them&s;elves nor others. The genero&s;ity, or ba&s;ene&s;s of our temper, our meekne&s;s or cruelty, our courage or pu&s;ilanimity, influence the fictions of the imagination with the mo&s;t unbounded li|berty, and di&s;cover them&s;elves in the mo&s;t glaring colours. In like manner, I am per|&s;uaded, there might be &s;everal u&s;eful di&s;co|veries made from a critici&s;m of the fictions of the antient philo&s;ophy, concerning <HI>&s;ub|&s;tances, and &s;ub&s;tantial forms, and accidents, and occult qualities;</HI> which, however un|rea&s;onable and capricious, have a very in|timate
<PB N="383" REF="395">
connexion with the principles of hu|man nature.</P>
<P>'TIS confe&s;t by the mo&s;t judicious philo|&s;ophers, that our ideas of bodies are nothing but collections form'd by the mind of the ideas of the &s;everal di&s;tinct &s;en&s;ible qualities, of which objects are compos'd, and which we find to have a con&s;tant union with each o|ther. But however the&s;e qualities may in them&s;elves be entirely di&s;tinct, 'tis certain we commonly regard the compound, which they form, as ONE thing, and as continuing the SAME under very con&s;iderable altera|tions. The acknowledg'd compo&s;ition is e|vidently contrary to this &s;uppos'd <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> and the variation to the <HI>identity.</HI> It may, therefore, be worth while to con&s;ider the <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> which make us almo&s;t univer&s;ally fall into &s;uch evident contradictions, as well as the <HI>means</HI> by which we endeavour to conceal them.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that as the ideas of the &s;everal di&s;tinct <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive</HI> qualities of objects are united together by a very clo&s;e relation, the mind, in looking along the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be carry'd from one part of it to an|other by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, and will no more perceive the change, than if it contemplated the &s;ame unchangeable object. This ea&s;y
<PB N="384" REF="396">
tran&s;ition is the effect, or rather e&s;&s;ence of relation; and as the imagination readily takes one idea for another, where their influence on the mind is &s;imilar; hence it proceeds, that any &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related qualities is readily con&s;ider'd as one continu'd object, exi&s;ting without any variation. The &s;mooth and uninterrupted progre&s;s of the thought, being alike in both ca&s;es, readily deceives the mind, and makes us a&s;cribe an identity to the changeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of connected qualities.</P>
<P>BUT when we alter our method of con|&s;idering the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in&s;tead of trace|ing it gradually thro' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive points of time, &s;urvey at once any two di&s;tinct periods of its duration, and compare the dif|ferent conditions of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive qualities; in that ca&s;e the variations, which were in|&s;en&s;ible when they aro&s;e gradually, do now appear of con&s;equence, and &s;eem entirely to de&s;troy the identity. By this means there ari&s;es a kind of contrariety in our method of thinking, from the different points of view, in which we &s;urvey the object, and from the nearne&s;s or remotene&s;s of tho&s;e in&s;tants of time, which we compare together. When we gradually follow an object in its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes, the &s;mooth progre&s;s of the thought
<PB N="385" REF="397">
makes us a&s;cribe an identity to the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; becau&s;e 'tis by a &s;imilar act of the mind we con&s;ider an unchangeable object. When we compare its &s;ituation after a con|&s;iderable change the progre&s;s of the thought is broke; and con&s;equently we are pre&s;ented with the idea of diver&s;ity: In order to re|concile which contradictions the imagination is apt to feign &s;omething unknown and in|vi&s;ible, which it &s;uppo&s;es to continue the &s;ame under all the&s;e variations; and this unintelligible &s;omething it calls a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance, or original and fir&s;t matter.</HI></P>
<P>WE entertain a like notion with regard to the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of &s;ub&s;tances, and from like cau&s;es. Suppo&s;e an object perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible to be pre&s;ented, along with another object, who&s;e <HI>co-exi&s;tent</HI> parts are connected together by a &s;trong relation, 'tis evident the actions of the mind, in con&s;i|dering the&s;e two objects, are not very different. The imagination conceives the &s;imple object at once, with facility, by a &s;ingle effort of thought, without change or variation. The connexion of parts in the compound object has almo&s;t the &s;ame effect, and &s;o unites the object within it&s;elf, that the fancy feels not the tran&s;ition in pa&s;&s;ing from one part to another. Hence the colour, ta&s;te, figure,
<PB N="386" REF="398">
&s;olidity, and other qualities, combin'd in a peach or melon, are conceiv'd to form <HI>one thing;</HI> and that on account of their clo&s;e relation, which makes them affect the thought in the &s;ame manner, as if perfect|ly uncompounded. But the mind re&s;ts not here. Whenever it views the object in an|other light, it finds that all the&s;e qualities are different, and di&s;tingui&s;hable, and &s;epa|rable from each other; which view of things being de&s;tructive of its primary and more natural notions, obliges the imagination to feign an unknown &s;omething, or <HI>original</HI> &s;ub|&s;tance and matter, as a principle of union or cohe&s;ion among the&s;e qualities, and as what may give the compound object a title to be call'd one thing, notwith&s;tanding its diver&s;ity and compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE peripatetic philo&s;ophy a&s;&s;erts the <HI>original</HI> matter to be perfectly homogeneous in all bodies, and con&s;iders fire, water, earth, and air, as of the very &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance; on account of their gradual revolutions and changes into each other. At the &s;ame time it a&s;&s;igns to each of the&s;e &s;pecies of objects a di&s;tinct <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial form,</HI> which it &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;ource of all tho&s;e different qua|lities they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and to be a new foun|dation of &s;implicity and identity to each par|icular
<PB N="387" REF="399">
&s;pecies. All depends on our manner of viewing the objects. When we look a|long the in&s;en&s;ible changes of bodies, we &s;uppo&s;e all of them to be of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance or e&s;&s;ence. When we con&s;ider their &s;en&s;ible differences, we attribute to each of them a &s;ub&s;tantial and e&s;&s;ential difference. And in order to indulge our&s;elves in both the&s;e ways of con&s;idering our objects, we &s;uppo&s;e all bodies to have at once a &s;ub&s;tance and a &s;ub&s;tantial form.</P>
<P>THE notion of <HI>accidents</HI> is an unavoid|able con&s;equence of this method of thinking with regard to &s;ub&s;tances and &s;ub&s;tantial forms; nor can we forbear looking upon colours, &s;ounds, ta&s;tes, figures, and other properties of bodies, as exi&s;tences, which can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t apart, but require a &s;ubject of inhe|&s;ion to &s;u&s;tain and &s;upport them. For having never di&s;cover'd any of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities, where, for the rea&s;ons above mention'd, we did not likewi&s;e fancy a &s;ub&s;tance to exi&s;t; the &s;ame habit, which makes us infer a con|nexion betwixt cau&s;e and effect, makes us here infer a dependance of every quality on the unknown &s;ub&s;tance. The cu&s;tom of imagining a dependance has the &s;ame effect as the cu&s;tom of ob&s;erving it wou'd have. This conceit, however, is no more rea&s;on|able
<PB N="388" REF="400">
than any of the foregoing. Every qua|lity being a di&s;tinct thing from another, may be conceiv'd to exi&s;t apart, and may exi&s;t apart, not only from every other quality, but from that unintelligible chimera of a &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e philo&s;ophers carry their fictions &s;till farther in their &s;entiments concerning <HI>oc|cult qualities,</HI> and both &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ub&s;tance &s;upporting, which they do not under&s;tand, and an accident &s;upported, of which they have as imperfect an idea. The whole &s;y|&s;tem, therefore, is entirely incomprehen&s;ible, and yet is deriv'd from principles as natural as any of the&s;e above-explain'd.</P>
<P>IN con&s;idering this &s;ubject we may ob|&s;erve a gradation of three opinions, that ri&s;e above each other, according as the per|&s;ons, who form them, acquire new degrees of rea&s;on and knowledge. The&s;e opinions are that of the vulgar, that of a fal&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy, and that of the true; where we &s;hall find upon enquiry, that the true phi|lo&s;ophy approaches nearer to the &s;entiments of the vulgar, than to tho&s;e of a mi&s;taken knowledge. 'Tis natural for men, in their common and carele&s;s way of thinking, to imagine they perceive a connexion betwixt &s;uch objects as they have con&s;tantly found
<PB N="389" REF="401">
united together; and becau&s;e cu&s;tom has render'd it difficult to &s;eparate the ideas, they are apt to fancy &s;uch a &s;eparation to be in it&s;elf impo&s;&s;ible and ab&s;urd. But philo&s;o|phers, who ab&s;tract from the effects of cu&s;|tom, and compare the ideas of objects, im|mediately perceive the fal&s;hood of the&s;e vul|gar &s;entiments, and di&s;cover that there is no known connexion among objects. Every dif|ferent object appears to them entirely di&s;tinct and &s;eparate; and they perceive, that 'tis not from a view of the nature and qualities of objects we infer one from another, but only when in &s;everal in&s;tances we ob&s;erve them to have been con&s;tantly conjoin'd. But the&s;e philo&s;ophers, in&s;tead of drawing a ju&s;t in|ference from this ob&s;ervation, and conclud|ing, that we have no idea of power or agency, &s;eparate from the mind, and be|longing to cau&s;es; I &s;ay, in&s;tead of drawing this conclu&s;ion, they frequently &s;earch for the qualities, in which this agency con&s;i&s;ts, and are di&s;pleas'd with every &s;y&s;tem, which their rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts to them, in order to explain it. They have &s;ufficient force of genius to free them from the vulgar error, that there is a natural and perceivable con|nexion betwixt the &s;everal &s;en&s;ible qualities and actions of matter; but not &s;ufficient to
<PB N="390" REF="402">
keep them from ever &s;eeking for this con|nexion in matter, or cau&s;es. Had they fal|len upon the ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, they wou'd have return'd back to the &s;ituation of the vulgar, and wou'd have regarded all the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions with indolence and indifference. At pre&s;ent they &s;eem to be in a very la|mentable condition, and &s;uch as the poets have given us but a faint notion of in their de&s;criptions of the puni&s;hment of <HI>Si&s;yphus</HI> and <HI>Tantalus.</HI> For what can be imagin'd more tormenting, than to &s;eek with eager|ne&s;s, what for ever flies us; and &s;eek for it in a place, where 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it can ever exi&s;t?</P>
<P>BUT as nature &s;eems to have ob&s;erv'd a kind of ju&s;tice and compen&s;ation in every thing, &s;he has not neglected philo&s;ophers more than the re&s;t of the creation; but has re&s;erv'd them a con&s;olation amid all their di&s;|appointments and afflictions. This con&s;ola|tion principally con&s;i&s;ts in their invention of the words <HI>faculty</HI> and <HI>occult quality.</HI> For it being u&s;ual, after the frequent u&s;e of terms, which are really &s;ignificant and intelligible, to omit the idea, which we wou'd expre&s;s by them, and to pre&s;erve only the cu&s;tom, by which we recal the idea at plea&s;ure; &s;o it naturally happens, that after the frequent u&s;e
<PB N="391" REF="403">
of terms, which are wholly in&s;ignificant and unintelligible, we fancy them to be on the &s;ame footing with the precedent, and to have a &s;ecret meaning, which we might di&s;|cover by reflection. The re&s;emblance of their appearance deceives the mind, as is u&s;ual, and makes us imagine a thorough re|&s;emblance and conformity. By this means the&s;e philo&s;ophers &s;et them&s;elves at ea&s;e, and arrive at la&s;t, by an illu&s;ion, at the &s;ame in|difference, which the people attain by their &s;tupidity, and true philo&s;ophers by their mo|derate &s;ceptici&s;m. They need only &s;ay, that any phaenomenon, which puzzles them, a|ri&s;es from a faculty or an occult quality, and there is an end of all di&s;pute and enquiry upon the matter.</P>
<P>BUT among all the in&s;tances, wherein the Peripatetics have &s;hewn they were guided by every trivial propen&s;ity of the imagination, no one is more remarkable than their <HI>&s;ym|pathies, antipathies, and horrors of a vacuum.</HI> There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature, to be&s;tow on external ob|jects the &s;ame emotions, which it ob&s;erves in it&s;elf; and to find every where tho&s;e ideas, which are mo&s;t pre&s;ent to it. This inclination, 'tis true, is &s;uppre&s;s'd by a little reflection, and only takes place in children,
<PB N="392" REF="404">

It ap|pears in children, by their de&s;ire of beating the &s;tones, which hurt them: In poets, by their readine&s;s to per&s;onify every thing: And in the antient philo&s;ophers, by the&s;e fictions of &s;ympathy and antipathy. We mu&s;t par|don children, becau&s;e of their age; poets, be|cau&s;e they profe&s;s to follow implicitly the &s;ugge&s;tions of their fancy: But what ex|cu&s;e &s;hall we find to ju&s;tify our philo&s;ophers in &s;o &s;ignal a weakne&s;s?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. <HI>Of the modern philo&s;ophy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUT here it may be objected, that the imagination, according to my own confe&s;&s;ion, being the ultimate judge of all &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, I am unju&s;t in blaming the antient philo&s;ophers for make|ing u&s;e of that faculty, and allowing them|&s;elves to be entirely guided by it in their rea&s;onings. In order to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, I mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h in the imagination betwixt the principles which are permanent, irre|&s;i&s;table, and univer&s;al; &s;uch as the cu&s;to|mary tran&s;ition from cau&s;es to effects, and
<PB N="393" REF="405">
from effects to cau&s;es: And the principles, which are changeable, weak, and irregular; &s;uch as tho&s;e I have ju&s;t now taken notice of. The former are the foundation of all our thoughts and actions, &s;o that upon their removal human nature mu&s;t immediately peri&s;h and go to ruin. The latter are nei|ther unavoidable to mankind, nor nece&s;&s;ary, or &s;o much as u&s;eful in the conduct of life; but on the contrary are ob&s;erv'd only to take place in weak minds, and being oppo&s;ite to the other principles of cu&s;tom and rea&s;on|ing, may ea&s;ily be &s;ubverted by a due con|tra&s;t and oppo&s;ition. For this rea&s;on the former are received by philo&s;ophy, and the latter rejected. One who concludes &s;ome|body to be near him, when he hears an articulate voice in the dark, rea&s;ons ju&s;tly and naturally; tho' that conclu&s;ion be de|riv'd from nothing but cu&s;tom, which in|fixes and inlivens the idea of a human crea|ture, on account of his u&s;ual conjunction with the pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ion. But one, who is tormented he knows not why, with the apprehen&s;ion of &s;pectres in the dark, may, perhaps, be &s;aid to rea&s;on, and to rea&s;on naturally too: But then it mu&s;t be in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that a malady is &s;aid to be na|tural; as ari&s;ing from natural cau&s;es, tho'
<PB N="394" REF="406">
it be contrary to health, the mo&s;t agreea|ble and mo&s;t natural &s;ituation of man.</P>
<P>THE opinions of the antient philo&s;o|phers, their fictions of &s;ub&s;tance and acci|dent, and their rea&s;onings concerning &s;ub|&s;tantial forms and occult qualities, are like the &s;pectres in the dark, and are deriv'd from principles, which, however common, are neither univer&s;al nor unavoidable in human nature. The <HI>modern philo&s;ophy</HI> pretends to be entirely free from this defect, and to a|ri&s;e only from the &s;olid, permanent, and con&s;i&s;tent principles of the imagination. Up|on what grounds this preten&s;ion is founded mu&s;t now be the &s;ubject of our enquiry.</P>
<P>THE fundamental principle of that phi|lo&s;ophy is the opinion concerning colours, &s;ounds, ta&s;tes, &s;mells, heat and cold; which it a&s;&s;erts to be nothing but impre&s;&s;ions in the mind, deriv'd from the operation of exter|nal objects, and without any re&s;emblance to the qualities of the objects. Upon examina|tion, I find only one of the rea&s;ons com|monly produc'd for this opinion to be &s;atis|factory, <HI>viz.</HI> that deriv'd from the varia|tions of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, even while the external object, to all appearance, continues the &s;ame. The&s;e variations depend upon &s;everal circum&s;tances. Upon the different
<PB N="395" REF="407">
&s;ituations of our health: A man in a mala|dy feels a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in meats, which before pleas'd him the mo&s;t. Upon the different complexions and con&s;titutions of men: That &s;eems bitter to one, which is &s;weet to another. Upon the difference of their external &s;ituation and po&s;ition: Colours reflected from the clouds change according to the di&s;tance of the clouds, and accord|ing to the angle they make with the eye and luminous body. Fire al&s;o communicates the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure at one di&s;tance, and that of pain at another. In&s;tances of this kind are very numerous and frequent.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion drawn from them, is likewi&s;e as &s;atisfactory as can po&s;&s;ibly be imagin'd. 'Tis certain, that when different impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e ari&s;e from any object, every one of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions has not a re&s;embling quality exi&s;tent in the ob|ject. For as the &s;ame object cannot, at the &s;ame time, be endow'd with different qua|lities of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and as the &s;ame qua|lity cannot re&s;emble impre&s;&s;ions entirely dif|ferent; it evidently follows, that many of our impre&s;&s;ions have no external model or archetype. Now from like effects we pre|&s;ume like cau&s;es. Many of the impre&s;&s;ions of colour, &s;ound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are confe&s;t to be no|thing
<PB N="396" REF="408">
but internal exi&s;tences, and to ari&s;e from cau&s;es, which no ways re&s;emble them. The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are in appearance no|thing different from the other impre&s;&s;ions of colour, &s;ound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We conclude, there|fore, that they are, all of them, deriv'd from a like origin.</P>
<P>THIS principle being once admitted, all the other doctrines of that philo&s;ophy &s;eem to follow by an ea&s;y con&s;equence. For upon the removal of &s;ounds, colours, heat, cold, and other &s;en&s;ible qualities, from the rank of continu'd independent exi&s;tences, we are reduc'd merely to what are called primary qualities, as the only <HI>real</HI> ones, of which we have any adequate notion. The&s;e primary qualities are exten&s;ion and &s;olidi|ty, with their different mixtures and modi|fications; figure, motion, gravity, and cohe|&s;ion. The generation, encrea&s;e, decay, and corruption of animals and vegetables, are nothing but changes of figure and motion; as al&s;o the operations of all bodies on each o|ther; of fire, of light, water, air, earth, and of all the elements and powers of nature. One figure and motion produces another figure and motion; nor does there remain in the material univer&s;e any other principle, either
<PB N="397" REF="409">
active or pa&s;&s;ive, of which we can form the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE many objections might be made to this &s;y&s;tem: But at pre&s;ent I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one, which is in my opi|nion very deci&s;ive. I a&s;&s;ert, that in&s;tead of explaining the operations of external ob|jects by its means, we utterly annihilate all the&s;e objects, and reduce our&s;elves to the opinions of the mo&s;t extravagant &s;ceptici&s;m concerning them. If colours, &s;ounds, ta&s;tes, and &s;mells be merely perceptions, nothing we can conceive is po&s;&s;e&s;t of a real, con|tinu'd, and independent exi&s;tence; not even motion, exten&s;ion and &s;olidity, which are the primary qualities chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>TO begin with the examination of mo|tion; 'tis evident this is a quality altogether inconceivable alone, and without a reference to &s;ome other object. The idea of motion nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es that of a body moving. Now what is our idea of the moving body, without which motion is incomprehen&s;ible? It mu&s;t re&s;olve it&s;elf into the idea of ex|ten&s;ion or of &s;olidity; and con&s;equently the reality of motion depends upon that of the&s;e other qualities.</P>
<P>THIS opinion, which is univer&s;ally ac|knowledg'd concerning motion, I have
<PB N="398" REF="410">
prov'd to be true with regard to exten&s;ion; and have &s;hewn that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive exten&s;ion, but as compo'd of parts, endow'd with colour or &s;olidity. The idea of exten&s;ion is a compound idea; but as it is not compounded of an infinite number of parts or inferior ideas, it mu&s;t at la&s;t re|&s;olve it&s;elf into &s;uch as are perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible. The&s;e &s;imple and indivi&s;i|ble parts, not being ideas of exten&s;ion, mu&s;t be non-entities, unle&s;s conceiv'd as colour'd or &s;olid. Colour is excluded from any real exi&s;tence. The reality, therefore, of our idea of exten&s;ion depends upon the reality of that of &s;olidity, nor can the former be ju&s;t while the latter is chimerical. Let us, then, lend our attention to the examination of the idea of &s;olidity.</P>
<P>THE idea of &s;olidity is that of two ob|jects, which being impell'd by the utmo&s;t force, cannot penetrate each other; but &s;till maintain a &s;eparate and di&s;tinct exi&s;tence. Solidity, therefore, is perfectly incomprehen&s;i|ble alone, and without the conception of &s;ome bodies, which are &s;olid, and maintain this &s;eparate and di&s;tinct exi&s;tence. Now what idea have we of the&s;e bodies? The ideas of colours, &s;ounds, and other &s;econdary qualities are excluded. The idea of mo|tion
<PB N="399" REF="411">
depends on that of exten&s;ion, and the idea of exten&s;ion on that of &s;olidity. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that the idea of &s;oli|dity can depend on either of them. For that wou'd be to run in a circle, and make one idea depend on another, while at the &s;ame time the latter depends on the former. Our modern philo&s;ophy, therefore, leaves us no ju&s;t nor &s;atisfactory idea of &s;olidity; nor con&s;equently of matter.</P>
<P>THIS argument will appear entirely con|clu&s;ive to every one that comprehends it; but becau&s;e it may &s;eem ab&s;tru&s;e and intri|cate to the generality of readers, I hope to be excus'd, if I endeavour to render it more obvious by &s;ome variation of the expre&s;&s;ion. In order to form an idea of &s;olidity, we mu&s;t conceive two bodies pre&s;&s;ing on each other without any penetration; and 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible to arrive at this idea, when we confine our&s;elves to one object, much more without conceiving any. Two non-entities cannot ex|clude each other from their places; becau&s;e they never po&s;&s;e&s;s any place, nor can be endow'd with any quality. Now I a&s;k, what idea do we form of the&s;e bodies or objects, to which we &s;uppo&s;e &s;olidity to be|long? To &s;ay, that we conceive them mere|ly as &s;olid, is to run on <HI>in infinitum.</HI> To
<PB N="400" REF="412">
affirm, that we paint them out to our&s;elves as extended, either re&s;olves all into a fal&s;e idea, or returns in a circle. Exten&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;ider'd either as colour'd, which is a fal&s;e idea; or as &s;olid, which brings us back to the fir&s;t que&s;tion. We may make the &s;ame ob&s;ervation concerning mobility and figure; and upon the whole mu&s;t conclude, that after the exclu&s;ion of colours, &s;ounds, heat and cold from the rank of external exi&s;tences, there remains nothing, which can afford us a ju&s;t and con|&s;i&s;tent idea of body.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that, properly &s;peaking, &s;olidity or impenetrability is nothing, but an impo&s;&s;ibility of annihilation, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 4.</NOTE> has been already ob&s;erv'd: For which rea&s;on 'tis the more nece&s;&s;ary for us to form &s;ome di&s;tinct idea of that object, who&s;e annihila|tion we &s;uppo&s;e impo&s;&s;ible. An impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of being annihilated cannot exi&s;t, and can never be conceived to exi&s;t, by it&s;elf; but nece&s;&s;arily requires &s;ome object or real exi&s;tence, to which it may belong. Now the difficulty &s;till remains, how to form an idea of this object or exi&s;tence, without having recour&s;e to the &s;econdary and &s;en&s;i|ble qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="413">
NOR mu&s;t we omit on this occa&s;ion our accu&s;tom'd method of examining ideas by con&s;idering tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, from which they are deriv'd. The impre&s;&s;ions, which enter by the &s;ight and hearing, the &s;mell and ta&s;te, are affirm'd by modern philo&s;ophy to be without any re&s;embling objects; and con|&s;equently the idea of &s;olidity, which is &s;uppos'd to be real, can never be deriv'd from any of the&s;e &s;en&s;es. There remains, therefore, the feeling as the only &s;en&s;e, that can convey the impre&s;&s;ion, which is original to the idea of &s;olidity; and indeed we na|turally imagine, that we feel the &s;olidity of bodies, and need but touch any object in or|der to perceive this quality. But this me|thod of thinking is more popular than phi|lo&s;ophical; as will appear from the follow|ing reflections.</P>
<P>FIRST, 'Tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that tho' bodies are felt by means of their &s;olidity, yet the feeling is a quite different thing from the &s;olidity; and that they have not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to each other. A man, who has the pal&s;ey in one hand, has as per|fect an idea of impenetrability, when he ob&s;erves that hand to be &s;upported by the table, as when he feels the &s;ame table with the other hand. An object, that pre&s;&s;es upon
<PB N="402" REF="414">
any of our members, meets with re&s;i&s;tance; and that re&s;i&s;tance, by the motion it gives to the nerves and animal &s;pirits, conveys a cer|tain &s;en&s;ation to the mind; but it does not follow, that the &s;en&s;ation, motion, and re&s;i|&s;tance are any ways re&s;embling.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The impre&s;&s;ions of touch are &s;imple impre&s;&s;ions, except when con&s;ider'd with regard to their exten&s;ion; which makes nothing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: And from this &s;implicity I infer, that they neither re|pre&s;ent &s;olidity, nor any real object. For let us put two ca&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a man, who pre&s;&s;es a &s;tone, or any &s;olid body, with his hand, and that of two &s;tones, which pre&s;&s;es each other; 'twill readily be allow'd, that the&s;e two ca&s;es are not in every re&s;pect alike, but that in the former there is con|join'd with the &s;olidity, a feeling or &s;en&s;a|tion, of which there is no appearance in the latter. In order, therefore, to make the&s;e two ca&s;es alike, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to remove &s;ome part of the impre&s;&s;ion, which the man feels by his hand, or organ of &s;en&s;ation; and that being impo&s;&s;ible in a &s;imple im|pre&s;&s;ion, obliges us to remove the whole, and proves that this whole impre&s;&s;ion has no archetype or model in external objects. To which we may add, that &s;olidity nece&s;|&s;arily
<PB N="403" REF="415">
&s;uppo&s;es two bodies, along with con|tiguity and impul&s;e; which being a com|pound object, can never be repre&s;ented by a &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion. Not to mention, that tho' &s;olidity continues always invariably the &s;ame, the impre&s;&s;ions of touch change eve|ry moment upon us; which is a clear proof that the latrer are not repre&s;entations of the former.</P>
<P>THUS there is a direct and total oppo|&s;ition betwixt our rea&s;on and our &s;en&s;es; or more properly &s;peaking, betwixt tho&s;e con|clu&s;ions we form from cau&s;e and effect, and tho&s;e that per&s;uade us of the continu'd and independent exi&s;tence of body. When we rea&s;on from cau&s;e and effect, we con|clude, that neither colour, &s;ound, ta&s;te, nor &s;mell have a continu'd and independent exi&s;|tence. When we exclude the&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities there remains nothing in the uni|ver&s;e, which has &s;uch an exi&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. <HI>Of the immateriality of the &s;oul.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING found &s;uch contradicti|ons and difficulties in every &s;y&s;tem concerning external objects, and in the idea of matter, which we fancy &s;o clear and de|terminate, we &s;hall naturally expect &s;till greater difficulties and contradictions in eve|ry hypothe&s;is concerning our internal per|ceptions, and the nature of the mind, which we are apt to imagine &s;o much more ob|&s;cure, and uncertain. But in this we &s;hou'd deceive our&s;elves. The intellectual world, tho' involv'd in infinite ob&s;curities, is not perplex'd with any &s;uch contradictions, as tho&s;e we have di&s;cover'd in the natu|ral. What is known concerning it, agrees with it&s;elf; and what is unknown, we mu&s;t be contented to leave &s;o.</P>
<P>'TIS true, wou'd we hearken to certain philo&s;ophers, they promi&s;e to dimini&s;h our ignorance; but I am afraid 'tis at the ha|zard of running us into contradictions, from which the &s;ubject is of it&s;elf exempted. The&s;e philo&s;ophers are the curious rea&s;oners concerning the material or immaterial &s;ub|&s;tances,
<PB N="405" REF="417">
in which they &s;uppo&s;e our percep|tions to inhere. In order to put a &s;top to the&s;e endle&s;s cavils on both &s;ides, I know no better method, than to a&s;k the&s;e philo|&s;ophers in a few words, <HI>What they mean by &s;ub&s;tance and inhe&s;ion?</HI> And after they have an&s;wer'd this que&s;tion, 'twill then be rea&s;on|able, and not till then, to enter &s;eriou&s;ly in|to the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion we have found impo&s;&s;i|ble to be an&s;wer'd with regard to matter and body: But be&s;ides that in the ca&s;e of the mind, it labours under all the &s;ame dif|ficulties, 'tis burthen'd with &s;ome additional ones, which are peculiar to that &s;ubject. As every idea is deriv'd from a precedent im|pre&s;&s;ion, had we any idea of the &s;ub&s;tance of our minds, we mu&s;t al&s;o have an impre&s;&s;ion of it; which is very difficult, if not impo&s;|&s;ible, to be conceiv'd. For how can an impre&s;&s;ion repre&s;ent a &s;ub&s;tance, otherwi&s;e than by re&s;embling it? And how can an im|pre&s;&s;ion re&s;emble a &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ince, accord|ing to this philo&s;ophy, it is not a &s;ub&s;tance, and has none of the peculiar qualities or characteri&s;tics of a &s;ub&s;tance?</P>
<P>BUT leaving the que&s;tion <HI>of what may or may not be,</HI> for that other <HI>what actually is,</HI> I de&s;ire tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who pretend
<PB N="406" REF="418">
that we have an idea of the &s;ub&s;tance of our minds, to point out the impre&s;&s;ion that produces it, and tell di&s;tinctly after what manner that impre&s;&s;ion operates, and from what object it is deriv'd. Is it an impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ation or of reflection? Is it plea&s;ant, or painful, or indifferent? Does it attend us at all times, or does it only return at inter|vals? If at intervals, at what times princi|pally does it return, and by what cau&s;es is it produc'd?</P>
<P>IF in&s;tead of an&s;wering the&s;e que&s;tions, any one &s;hou'd evade the difficulty, by &s;ay|ing, that the definition of a &s;ub&s;tance is <HI>&s;omething which may exi&s;t by it&s;elf;</HI> and that this definition ought to &s;atisfy us: Shou'd this be &s;aid, I &s;hou'd ob&s;erve, that this de|finition agrees to every thing, that can po&s;|&s;ibly be conceiv'd; and never will &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ub&s;tance from accident, or the &s;oul from its perceptions. For thus I rea&s;on. Whatever is clearly conceiv'd may exi&s;t; and whatever is clearly conceiv'd, after any manner, may exi&s;t after the &s;ame manner. This is one principle, which has been al|ready acknowledg'd. Again, every thing, which is different, is di&s;tingui&s;hable, and every thing which is di&s;tingui&s;hable, is &s;e|parable by the imagination. This is ano|ther
<PB N="407" REF="419">
principle. My conclu&s;ion from both is, that &s;ince all our perceptions are different from each other, and from every thing el&s;e in the univer&s;e, they are al&s;o di&s;tinct and &s;eparable, and may be con&s;ider'd as &s;epa|rately exi&s;tent, and may exi&s;t &s;eparately, and have no need of any thing el&s;e to &s;up|port their exi&s;tence. They are, therefore, &s;ub&s;tances, as far as this definition explains a &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THUS neither by con&s;idering the fir&s;t origin of ideas, nor by means of a defini|tion are we able to arrive at any &s;atisfactory notion of &s;ub&s;tance; which &s;eems to me a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for abandoning utterly that di&s;pute concerning the materiality and im|materiality of the &s;oul, and makes me ab&s;o|lutely condemn even the que&s;tion it&s;elf. We have no perfect idea of any thing but of a perception. A &s;ub&s;tance is entirely dif|ferent from a perception. We have, there|fore, no idea of a &s;ub&s;tance. Inhe&s;ion in &s;omething is &s;uppos'd to be requi&s;ite to &s;up|port the exi&s;tence of our perceptions. No|thing appears requi&s;ite to &s;upport the exi&s;|tence of a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of inhe&s;ion. What po&s;&s;ibility then of an&s;wering that que&s;tion, <HI>Whether percep|tions inhere in a material or immaterial &s;ub|&s;tance,</HI>
<PB N="408" REF="420">
when we do not &s;o much as under|&s;tand the meaning of the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>THERE is one argument commonly em|ploy'd for the immateriality of the &s;oul, which &s;eems to me remarkable. Whatever is extend|ed con&s;i&s;ts of parts; and whatever con&s;i&s;ts of parts is divi&s;ible, if not in reality, at lea&s;t in the imagination. But 'tis impo&s;&s;ible any thing divi&s;ible can be <HI>conjoin'd</HI> to a thought or perception, which is a being altogether in&s;eparable and indivi&s;ible. For &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a conjunction, wou'd the indivi&s;ible though exi&s;t on the left or on the right hand of this extended divi&s;ible body? On the &s;urface or in the middle? On the back|or fore-&s;ide of it? If it be conjoin'd with the exten&s;ion, it mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;omewhere with|in its dimen&s;ions. If it exi&s;t within its di|men&s;ions, it mu&s;t either exi&s;t in one parti|cular part; and then that particular part is indivi&s;ible, and the perception is conjoin'd only with it, not with the exten&s;ion: Or if the thought exi&s;ts in every part, it mu&s;t al|&s;o be extended, and &s;eparable, and divi&s;ible, as well as the body; which is utterly ab|&s;urd and contradictory. For can any one conceive a pa&s;&s;ion of a yard in length, a foot in breadth, and an inch in thickne&s;s? Thought, therefore, and exten&s;ion are qua|lities
<PB N="409" REF="421">
wholly incompatible, and never can incorporate together into one &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THIS argument affects not the que&s;tion concerning the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of the &s;oul, but on|ly that concerning its <HI>local conjunction</HI> with matter; and therefore it may not be impro|per to con&s;ider in general what objects are, or are not &s;u&s;ceptible of a local conjunction. This is a curious que&s;tion and may lead us to &s;ome di&s;coveries of con&s;iderable moment.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t notion of &s;pace and exten&s;ion is deriv'd &s;olely from the &s;en&s;es of &s;ight and feeling; nor is there any thing, but what is colour'd or tangible, that has parts di&s;pos'd after &s;uch a manner, as to convey that idea. When we dimini&s;h or encrea&s;e a reli&s;h, 'tis not after the &s;ame manner that we dimini&s;h or increa&s;e any vi&s;ible object; and when &s;everal &s;ounds &s;trike our hearing at once, cu&s;tom and reflection alone make us form an idea of the degrees of the di&s;tance and contiguity of tho&s;e bodies, from which they are deriv'd. Whatever marks the place of its exi&s;tence either mu&s;t be extended, or mu&s;t be a mathematical point, without parts or compo&s;ition. What is extended mu&s;t have a particular figure, as &s;quare, round, triangular; none of which will agree to a de&s;ire, or indeed to any impre&s;&s;ion or idea,
<PB N="410" REF="422">
except of the&s;e two &s;en&s;es above-men|tion'd. Neither ought a de&s;ire, tho' indivi|&s;ible, to be con&s;ider'd as a mathematical point. For in that ca&s;e 'twou'd be po&s;&s;ible, by the addition of others, to make two, three, four de&s;ires, and the&s;e di&s;pos'd and &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner, as to have a determinate length, breadth and thickne&s;s; which is e|vidently ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>'TWILL not be &s;urprizing after this, if I deliver a maxim, which is condemn'd by &s;everal metaphy&s;icians, and is e&s;teem'd con|trary to the mo&s;t certain principles of hu|man rea&s;on. This maxim is <HI>that an object may exi&s;t, and yet be no where:</HI> and I a&s;|&s;ert, that this is not only po&s;&s;ible, but that the greate&s;t part of beings do and mu&s;t ex|i&s;t after this manner. An object may be &s;aid to be no where, when its parts are not &s;o &s;ituated with re&s;pect to each other, as to form any figure or quantity; nor the whole with re&s;pect to other bodies &s;o as to an&s;wer to our notions of contiguity or di&s;tance. Now this is evidently the ca&s;e with all our perceptions and objects, except tho&s;e of the &s;ight and feeling. A moral reflection can|not be plac'd on the right or on the left hand of a pa&s;&s;ion, nor can a &s;mell or &s;ound be either of a circular or a &s;quare figure.
<PB N="411" REF="423">
The&s;e objects and perceptions, &s;o far from requiring any particular place, are ab&s;olutely incompatible with it, and even the imagi|nation cannot attribute it to them. And as to the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing them to be no where, we may con&s;ider, that if the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments appear to the per|ception to have any particular place, the idea of exten&s;ion might be deriv'd from them, as well as from the &s;ight and touch; con|trary to what we have already e&s;tabli&s;h'd. If they <HI>appear</HI> not to have any particular place, they may po&s;&s;ibly <HI>exi&s;t</HI> in the &s;ame manner; &s;ince whatever we conceive is po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>'TWILL not now be nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that tho&s;e perceptions, which are &s;imple, and exi&s;t no where, are incapable of any con|junction in place with matter or body, which is extended and divi&s;ible; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to found a relation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part I. Sect. 5.</NOTE> but on &s;ome common quality. It may be better worth our while to remark, that this que&s;tion of the local conjunction of objects does not only occur in metaphy&s;ical di&s;putes concern|ing the nature of the &s;oul, but that even in common life we have every moment oc|ca&s;ion to examine it. Thus &s;uppo&s;ing we
<PB N="412" REF="424">
con&s;ider a fig at one end of the table, and an olive at the other, 'tis evident, that in forming the complex ideas of the&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances, one of the mo&s;t obvious is that of their different reli&s;hes; and 'tis as evident, that we incorporate and conjoin the&s;e qua|lities with &s;uch as are colour'd and tangible. The bitter ta&s;te of the one, and &s;weet of the other are &s;uppos'd to lie in the very vi|&s;ible body, and to be &s;eparated from each other by the whole length of the table. This is &s;o notable and &s;o natural an illu&s;ion, that it may be proper to con&s;ider the prin|ciples, from which it is deriv'd.</P>
<P>THO' an extended object be incapable of a conjunction in place with another, that exi&s;ts without any place or exten&s;ion, yet are they &s;u&s;ceptible of many other relations. Thus the ta&s;te and &s;mell of any fruit are in&s;eparable from its other qualities of colour and tangibility; and which-ever of them be the cau&s;e or effect, 'tis certain they are al|ways co-exi&s;tent. Nor are they only co-exi&s;tent in general, but al&s;o co-temporary in their appearance in the mind; and 'tis upon the application of the extended body to our &s;en&s;es we perceive its particular ta&s;te and &s;mell. The&s;e relations, then, of <HI>cau&s;ation, and contiguity in the time of their appear|ance,</HI>
<PB N="413" REF="425">
betwixt the extended object and the quality, which exi&s;ts without any particular place, mu&s;t have &s;uch an effect on the mind, that upon the appearance of one it will im|mediately turn its thought to the conception of the other. Nor is this all. We not only turn our thought from one to the other upon account of their relation, but likewi&s;e en|deavour to give them a new relation, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>a conjunction in place,</HI> that we may render the tran&s;ition more ea&s;y and natural. For 'tis a quality, which I &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to remark in human nature, and &s;hall explain more fully in its proper place, that when objects are united by any rela|tion, we have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to add &s;ome new relation to them, in order to com|pleat the union. In our arrangement of bo|dies we never fail to place &s;uch as are re|&s;embling, in contiguity to each other, or at lea&s;t in corre&s;pondent points of view: Why? but becau&s;e we feel a &s;atisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of re&s;em|blance, or the re&s;emblance of &s;ituation to that of qualities. The effects of this pro|pen&s;ity have been <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 2. towards the end.</NOTE> already ob&s;erv'd in that re&s;emblance, which we &s;o readily &s;uppo&s;e betwixt particular impre&s;&s;ions and their ex|ternal
<PB N="414" REF="426">
cau&s;es. But we &s;hall not find a more evident effect of it, than in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, where from the relations of cau&s;a|tion and contiguity in time betwixt two objects, we feign likewi&s;e that of a con|junction in place, in order to &s;trengthen the connextion.</P>
<P>BUT whatever confus'd notions we may form of an union in place betwixt an ex|tended body, as a fig, and its particular ta&s;te, 'tis certain that upon reflection we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve in this union &s;omething altogether un|intelligible and contradictory. For &s;hou'd we a&s;k our&s;elves one obvious que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> if the ta&s;te, which we conceive to be con|tain'd in the circumference of the body, is in every part of it or in one only, we mu&s;t quickly find our&s;elves at a lo&s;s, and perceive the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever giving a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. We cannot reply, that 'tis only in one part: For experience convinces us, that every part has the &s;ame reli&s;h. We can as little reply, that it exi&s;ts in every part: For then we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it figur'd and extended; which is ab&s;urd and incompre|hen&s;ible. Here then we are influenc'd by two principles directly contrary to each o|ther, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>inclination</HI> of our fancy by which we are determin'd to incorporate the
<PB N="415" REF="427">
ta&s;te with the extended object, and our <HI>rea|&s;on,</HI> which &s;hows us the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an union. Being divided betwixt the&s;e op|po&s;ite principles, we renounce neither one nor the other, but involve the &s;ubject in &s;uch confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity, that we no longer perceive the oppo&s;ition. We &s;up|po&s;e, that the ta&s;te exi&s;ts within the cir|cumference of the body, but in &s;uch a manner, that it fills the whole without ex|ten&s;ion, and exi&s;ts entire in every part with|out &s;eparation. In &s;hort, we u&s;e in our mo&s;t familiar way of thinking, that &s;chola&s;tic prin|ciple, which, when crudely propos'd, appears &s;o &s;hocking, of <HI>totum in toto &amp; totum in qua|libet parte:</HI> Which is much the &s;ame, as if we &s;hou'd &s;ay, that a thing is in a certain place, and yet is not there.</P>
<P>ALL this ab&s;urdity proceeds from our en|deavouring to be&s;tow a place on what is utterly incapable of it; and that endeavour again ari&s;es from our inclination to compleat an union, which is founded on cau&s;ation, and a contiguity of time, by attributing to the objects a conjunction in place. But if ever rea&s;on be of &s;ufficient force to over|come prejudice, 'tis certain, that in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e it mu&s;t prevail. For we have only this choice left, either to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome be|ings 
<PB N="416" REF="428">
ings exi&s;t without any place; or that they are figur'd and extended; or that when they are incorporated with extended objects, the whole is in the whole, and the whole in every part. The ab&s;urdity of the two la&s;t &s;uppo&s;itions proves &s;ufficiently the veracity of the fir&s;t. Nor is there any fourth opi|nion. For as to the &s;uppo&s;ition of their ex|i&s;tence in the manner of mathematical points, it re&s;olves it&s;elf into the &s;econd opinion, and &s;uppo&s;es, that &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions may be plac'd in a circular figure, and that a certain num|ber of &s;mells, conjoin'd with a certain num|ber of &s;ounds, may make a body of twelve cubic inches; which appears ridiculous upon the bare mentioning of it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' in this view of things we can|not refu&s;e to condemn the materiali&s;ts, who conjoin all thought with exten&s;ion; yet a little reflection will &s;how us equal rea&s;on for blam|ing their antagoni&s;ts, who conjoin all thought with a &s;imple and indivi&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance. The mo&s;t vulgar philo&s;ophy informs us, that no external object can make it&s;elf known to the mind immediately, and without the interpo&s;ition of an image or perception. That table, which ju&s;t now appears to me, is only a perception, and all its qualities are qualities of a perception. Now the mo&s;t
<PB N="417" REF="429">
obvious of all its qualities is exten&s;ion. The perception con&s;i&s;ts of parts. The&s;e parts are &s;o &s;ituated, as to afford us the notion of di&s;tance and contiguity; of length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. The termination of the&s;e three dimen&s;ions is what we call figure. This figure is moveable, &s;eparable, and divi|&s;ible. Mobility, and &s;eparability are the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing properties of extended objects. And to cut &s;hort all di&s;putes, the very idea of exten&s;ion is copy'd from nothing but an impre&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently mu&s;t perfectly agree to it. To &s;ay the idea of exten&s;ion agrees to any thing, is to &s;ay it is extended.</P>
<P>THE free-thinker may now triumph in his turn; and having found there are impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas really extended, may a&s;k his antagoni&s;ts, how they can incorporate a &s;imple and indivi&s;ible &s;ubject with an ex|tended perception? All the arguments of Theologians may here be retorted upon them. Is the indivi&s;ible &s;ubject, or immaterial &s;ub|&s;tance, if you will, on the left or on the right hand of the perception? Is it in this particular part, or in that other? Is it in every part without being extended? Or is it entire in any one part without de&s;erting the re&s;t? 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions, but what will both be ab|&s;urd
<PB N="418" REF="430">
in it&s;elf, and will account for the union of our indivi&s;ible perceptions with an extend|ed &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THIS gives me an occa&s;ion to take a-new into con&s;ideration the que&s;tion concerning the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul; and tho' I have con|demn'd that que&s;tion as utterly unintelligible, yet I cannot forbear propo&s;ing &s;ome farther reflections concerning it. I a&s;&s;ert, that the doctrine of the immateriality, &s;implicity, and indivi&s;ibility of a thinking &s;ub&s;tance is a true athei&s;m, and will &s;erve to ju&s;tify all tho&s;e &s;entiments, for which <HI>Spinoza</HI> is &s;o univer|&s;ally infamous. From this topic, I hope at lea&s;t to reap one advantage, that my adver|&s;aries will not have any pretext to render the pre&s;ent doctrine odious by their decla|mations, when they &s;ee that they can be &s;o ea&s;ily retorted on them.</P>
<P>THE fundamental principle of the athe|i&s;m of <HI>Spinoza</HI> is the doctrine of the &s;im|plicity of the univer&s;e, and the unity of that &s;ub&s;tance, in which he &s;uppo&s;es both thought and matter to inhere. There is only one &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ays he, in the world; and that &s;ub&s;tance is perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible, and exi&s;ts every where, without any local pre&s;ence. Whatever we di&s;cover externally
<PB N="419" REF="431">
by &s;en&s;ation; whatever we feel internally by reflection; all the&s;e are nothing but mo|difications of that one, &s;imple, and nece&s;&s;a|rily exi&s;tent being, and are not po&s;&s;e&s;t of any &s;eparate or di&s;tinct exi&s;tence. Every pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul; every configuration of matter, however different and various, in|here in the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, and pre&s;erve in them&s;elves their characters of di&s;tinction, without communicating them to that &s;ubject, in which they inhere. The &s;ame <HI>&s;ub&s;tratum,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, &s;upports the mo&s;t dif|ferent modifications, without any difference in it&s;elf; and varies them, without any va|riation. Neither time, nor place, nor all the diver&s;ity of nature are able to produce any compo&s;ition or change in its perfect &s;impli|city and identity.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE this brief expo&s;ition of the principles of that famous athei&s;t will be &s;uf|ficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and that without entering farther into the&s;e gloomy and ob&s;cure regions, I &s;hall be able to &s;hew, that this hideous hypothe&s;is is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of the immateriality of the &s;oul, which has become &s;o popular. To make this evident, let us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part II. Sect. 6.</NOTE> remember, that
<PB N="420" REF="432">
as every idea is deriv'd from a preceding perception, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible our idea of a per|ception, and that of an object or external exi&s;tence can ever repre&s;ent what are &s;peci|fically different from each other. Whatever difference we may &s;uppo&s;e betwixt them, 'tis &s;till incomprehen&s;ible to us; and we are oblig'd either to conceive an external object merely as a relation without a relative, or to make it the very &s;ame with a perception or impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equence I &s;hall draw from this may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear a mere &s;ophi&s;m; but upon the lea&s;t examination will be found &s;olid and &s;atisfactory. I &s;ay then, that &s;ince we may &s;uppo&s;e, but never can conceive a &s;pecific difference betwixt an object and im|pre&s;&s;ion; any conclu&s;ion we form concern|ing the connexion and repugnance of im|pre&s;&s;ions, will not be known certainly to be applicable to objects; but that on the other hand, whatever conclu&s;ions of this kind we form concerning objects, will mo&s;t certainly be applicable to impre&s;&s;ions. The rea&s;on is not difficult. As an object is &s;uppos'd to be different from an impre&s;&s;ion, we cannot be &s;ure, that the circum&s;tance, upon which we found our rea&s;oning, is common to both, &s;uppo&s;ing we form the rea&s;oning upon the
<PB N="421" REF="433">
impre&s;&s;ion. 'Tis &s;till po&s;&s;ible, that the ob|ject may differ from it in that particular. But when we fir&s;t form our rea&s;oning con|cerning the object, 'tis beyond doubt, that the &s;ame rea&s;oning mu&s;t extend to the impre&s;|&s;ion: And that becau&s;e the quality of the object, upon which the argument is founded, mu&s;t at lea&s;t be conceiv'd by the mind; and cou'd not be conceiv'd, unle&s;s it were com|mon to an impre&s;&s;ion; &s;ince we have no idea but what is deriv'd from that origin. Thus we may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a certain maxim, that we can never, by any principle, but by an irregular kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as that of Sect. 2. form the coherence of our perceptions.</NOTE> of rea&s;oning from experi|ence, di&s;cover a connexion or repugnance betwixt objects, which extends not to im|pre&s;&s;ions; tho' the inver&s;e propo&s;ition may not be equally true, that all the di&s;coverable relations of impre&s;&s;ions are common to ob|jects.</P>
<P>To apply this to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; there are two different &s;y&s;tems of beings pre&s;ented, to which I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;igning &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance, or ground of inhe&s;ion. I ob&s;erve fir&s;t the univer&s;e of ob|jects or of body: The &s;un, moon and &s;tars; the earth, &s;eas, plants, animals, men, &s;hips,
<PB N="422" REF="434">
hou&s;es, and other productions either of art or nature. Here <HI>Spinoza</HI> appears, and tells me, that the&s;e are only modifications; and that the &s;ubject, in which they inhere, is &s;imple, incompounded, and indivi&s;ible. After this I con&s;ider the other &s;y&s;tem of beings, <HI>viz.</HI> the univer&s;e of thought, or my impre&s;|&s;ions and ideas. There I ob&s;erve another &s;un, moon and &s;tars; an earth, and &s;eas, cover'd and inhabited by plants and ani|mals; towns, hou&s;es, mountains, rivers; and in &s;hort every thing I can di&s;cover or con|ceive in the fir&s;t &s;y&s;tem. Upon my en|quiring concerning the&s;e, Theologians pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, and tell me, that the&s;e al&s;o are modifications, and modifications of one &s;imple, uncompounded, and indivi&s;ible &s;ub|&s;tance. Immediately upon which I am deafen'd with the noi&s;e of a hundred voices, that treat the fir&s;t hypothe&s;is with dete&s;ta|tion and &s;corn, and the &s;econd with ap|plau&s;e and veneration. I turn my attention to the&s;e hypothe&s;es to &s;ee what may be the rea&s;on of &s;o great a partiality; and find that they have the &s;ame fault of being unintel|ligible, and that as far as we can under|&s;tand them, they are &s;o much alike, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any ab&s;urdity in one, which is not common to both of them. We
<PB N="423" REF="435">
have no idea of any quality in an object, which does not agree to, and may not re|pre&s;ent a quality in an impre&s;&s;ion; and that becau&s;e all our ideas are deriv'd from our impre&s;&s;ions. We can never, therefore, find any repugnance betwixt an extended object as a modification, and a &s;imple uncom|pounded e&s;&s;ence, as its &s;ub&s;tance, unle&s;s that repugnance takes place equally betwixt the perception or impre&s;&s;ion of that extended object, and the &s;ame uncompounded e&s;&s;ence. Every idea of a quality in an object pa&s;&s;es thro' an impre&s;&s;ion; and therefore every <HI>per|ceivable</HI> relation, whether of connexion or repugnance, mu&s;t be common both to ob|jects and impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this argument, con&s;ider'd in general, &s;eems evident beyond all doubt and contradiction, yet to make it more clear and &s;en&s;ible, let us &s;urvey it in detail; and &s;ee whether all the ab&s;urdities, which have been found in the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Spinoza,</HI> may not like|wi&s;e be di&s;cover'd in that of Theologians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Bayle</HI>'s dictionary, article of <HI>Spinoza.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FIRST, It has been &s;aid again&s;t <HI>Spinoza,</HI> according to the &s;chola&s;tic way of talking, rather than thinking, that a mode, not be|ing any di&s;tinct or &s;eparate exi&s;tence, mu&s;t be the very &s;ame with its &s;ub&s;tance, and
<PB N="424" REF="436">
con&s;equently the exten&s;ion of the univer&s;e, mu&s;t be in a manner identify'd with that &s;imple, uncompounded e&s;&s;ence, in which the univer&s;e is &s;uppos'd to inhere. But this, it may be pretended, is utterly impo&s;&s;ible and inconceivable unle&s;s the indivi&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance expand it&s;elf, &s;o as to corre&s;pond to the exten&s;ion, or the exten&s;ion contract it&s;elf, &s;o as to an&s;wer to the indivi&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance. This argument &s;eems ju&s;t, as far as we can under&s;tand it; and 'tis plain nothing is re|quir'd, but a change in the terms, to apply the &s;ame argument to our extended percep|tions, and the &s;imple e&s;&s;ence of the &s;oul; the ideas of objects and perceptions being in every re&s;pect the &s;ame, only attended with the &s;uppo&s;ition of a difference, that is un|known and incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, It has been &s;aid, that we have no idea of &s;ub&s;tance, which is not applicable to matter; nor any idea of a di&s;|tinct &s;ub&s;tance, which is not applicable to every di&s;tinct portion of matter. Matter, therefore, is not a mode but a &s;ub&s;tance, and each part of matter is not a di&s;tinct mode, but a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance. I have al|ready prov'd, that we have no perfect idea of &s;ub&s;tance; but that taking it for <HI>&s;ome|thing, that can exi&s;t by it&s;elf,</HI> 'tis evident
<PB N="425" REF="437">
every perception is a &s;ub&s;tance, and every di&s;tinct part of a perception a di&s;tinct &s;ub|&s;tance: And con&s;equently the one hypo|the&s;is labours under the &s;ame difficulties in this re&s;pect with the other.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, It has been objected to the &s;y&s;tem of one &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance in the uni|ver&s;e, that this &s;ub&s;tance being the &s;upport or <HI>&s;ub&s;tratum</HI> of every thing, mu&s;t at the very &s;ame in&s;tant be modify'd into forms, which are contrary and incompatible. The round and &s;quare figures are incompatible in the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance at the &s;ame time. How then is it po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance can at once be modify'd into that &s;quare table, and into this round one? I a&s;k the &s;ame que&s;tion concerning the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e tables; and find that the an&s;wer is no more &s;atisfactory in one ca&s;e than in the other.</P>
<P>IT appears, then, that to whatever &s;ide we turn, the &s;ame difficulties follow us, and that we cannot advance one &s;tep towards the e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;implicity and immate|riality of the &s;oul, without preparing the way for a dangerous and irrecoverable athei&s;m. 'Tis the &s;ame ca&s;e, if in&s;tead of calling thought a modification of the &s;oul, we &s;hou'd give it the more antient, and yet more modi&s;h name of an <HI>action.</HI> By an
<PB N="426" REF="438">
action we mean much the &s;ame thing, as what is commonly call'd an ab&s;tract mode; that is, &s;omething, which, properly &s;peak|ing, is neither di&s;tingui&s;hable, nor &s;eparable from its &s;ub&s;tance, and is only conceiv'd by a di&s;tinction of rea&s;on, or an ab&s;traction. But nothing is gain'd by this change of the term of modification, for that of action; nor do we free our&s;elves from one &s;ingle difficulty by its means; as will appear from the two following reflections.</P>
<P>FIRST, I ob&s;erve, that the word, action, according to this explication of it, can never ju&s;tly be apply'd to any perception, as de|riv'd from a mind or thinking &s;ub&s;tance. Our perceptions are all really different, and &s;eparable, and di&s;tingui&s;hable from each o|ther, and from every thing el&s;e, which we can imagine; and therefore 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, how they can be the action or ab|&s;tract mode of any &s;ub&s;tance. The in&s;tance of motion, which is commonly made u&s;e of to &s;hew after what manner perception de|pends, as an action, upon its &s;ub&s;tance, ra|ther confounds than in&s;tructs us. Motion to all appearance induces no real nor e&s;&s;en|tial change on the body, but only varies its relation to other objects. But betwixt a per&s;on in the morning walking in a garden
<PB N="427" REF="439">
with company, agreeable to him; and a per&s;on in the afternoon inclos'd in a dun|geon, and full of terror, de&s;pair, and re&s;ent|ment, there &s;eems to be a radical difference, and of quite another kind, than what is produc'd on a body by the change of its &s;i|tuation. As we conclude from the di&s;tinc|tion and &s;eparability of their ideas, that ex|ternal objects have a &s;eparate exi&s;tence from each other; &s;o when we make the&s;e ideas them&s;elves our objects, we mu&s;t draw the &s;ame conclu&s;ion concerning <HI>them,</HI> accord|ing to the precedent rea&s;oning. At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that having no idea of the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to tell how it can admit of &s;uch differences, and even contrarieties of perception without any fundamental change; and con&s;equently can never tell in what &s;en&s;e perceptions are actions of that &s;ub&s;tance. The u&s;e, therefore, of the word, <HI>action,</HI> unaccom|pany'd with any meaning, in&s;tead of that of modification, makes no addition to our knowledge, nor is of any advantage to the doctrine of the immateriality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>I ADD in the &s;econd place, that if it brings any advantage to that cau&s;e, it mu&s;t bring an equal to the cau&s;e of athei&s;m. For do our Theologians pretend to make a mo|nopoly
<PB N="428" REF="440">
of the word, <HI>action,</HI> and may not the athei&s;ts likewi&s;e take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and af|firm that plants, animals, men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are nothing but particular actions of one &s;imple univer&s;al &s;ub&s;tance, which exerts it&s;elf from a blind and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity? This you'll &s;ay is utterly ab&s;urd. I own 'tis unintel|ligible; but at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ert, ac|cording to the principles above-explain'd, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover any ab&s;urdity in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that all the various ob|jects in nature are actions of one &s;imple &s;ub|&s;tance, which ab&s;urdity will not be appli|cable to a like &s;uppo&s;ition concerning im|pre&s;&s;ions and ideas.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e hypothe&s;es concerning the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>local conjunction</HI> of our per|ceptions, we may pa&s;s to another, which is more intelligible than the former, and more important than the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> concerning the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of our perceptions. Matter and mo|tion, 'tis commonly &s;aid in the &s;chools, however vary'd, are &s;till matter and motion, and produce only a difference in the po|&s;ition and &s;ituation of objects. Divide a body as often as you plea&s;e, 'tis &s;till body. Place it in any figure, nothing ever re&s;ults but figure, or the relation of parts. Move it in any manner, you &s;till find motion or
<PB N="429" REF="441">
a change of relation. 'Tis ab&s;urd to ima|gine, that motion in a circle, for in&s;tance, &s;hou'd be nothing but merely motion in a circle; while motion in another direction, as in an ellip&s;e, &s;hou'd al&s;o be a pa&s;&s;ion or moral reflection: That the &s;hocking of two globular particles &s;hou'd become a &s;en&s;ation of pain, and that the meeting of two tri|angular ones &s;hou'd afford a plea&s;ure. Now as the&s;e different &s;hocks, and variations, and mixtures are the only changes, of which matter is &s;u&s;ceptible, and as the&s;e never af|ford us any idea of thought or perception, 'tis concluded to be impo&s;&s;ible, that thought can ever be caus'd by matter.</P>
<P>FEW have been able to with&s;tand the &s;eeming evidence of this argument; and yet nothing in the world is more ea&s;y than to refute it. We need only reflect on what has been prov'd at large, that we are never &s;en&s;ible of any connexion betwixt cau&s;es and effects, and that 'tis only by our experience of their con&s;tant conjunction, we can arrive at any knowledge of this re|lation. Now as all objects, which are not contrary, are &s;u&s;ceptible of a con&s;tant con|junction, and as no real objects are contrary; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part III. Sect. 15.</NOTE> I have inferr'd from the&s;e principles, that
<PB N="430" REF="442">
to con&s;ider the matter <HI>a priori,</HI> any thing may produce any thing, and that we &s;hall never di&s;cover a rea&s;on, why any object may or may not be the cau&s;e of any other, however great, or however little the re&s;em|blance may be betwixt them. This evi|dently de&s;troys the precedent rea&s;oning con|cerning the cau&s;e of thought or perception. For tho' there appear no manner of con|nexion betwixt motion or thought, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with all other cau&s;es and effects. Place one body of a pound weight on one end of a lever, and another body of the &s;ame weight on another end; you will never find in the&s;e bodies any principle of motion dependent on their di&s;tances from the cen|ter, more than of thought and perception. If you pretend, therefore, to prove <HI>a priori,</HI> that &s;uch a po&s;ition of bodies can never cau&s;e thought; becau&s;e turn it which way you will, 'tis nothing but a po&s;ition of bodies; you mu&s;t by the &s;ame cour&s;e of rea&s;oning conclude, that it can never produce mo|tion; &s;ince there is no more apparent con|nexion in the one ca&s;e than in the other. But as this latter conclu&s;ion is contrary to evident experience, and as 'tis po&s;&s;ible we may have a like experience in the opera|tions of the mind, and may perceive a con|&s;tant
<PB N="431" REF="443">
conjunction of thought and motion; you rea&s;on too ha&s;tily, when from the mere con|&s;ideration of the ideas, you conclude that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible motion can ever produce thought, or a different po&s;ition of parts give ri&s;e to a different pa&s;&s;ion or reflection. Nay 'tis not only po&s;&s;ible we may have &s;uch an experience, but 'tis certain we have it; &s;ince every one may perceive, that the different di&s;po&s;itions of his body change his thoughts and &s;enti|ments. And &s;hou'd it be &s;aid, that this depends on the union of &s;oul and body; I wou'd an&s;wer, that we mu&s;t &s;eparate the que&s;tion concerning the &s;ub&s;tance of the mind from that concerning the cau&s;e of its thought; and that confining our&s;elves to the latter que&s;tion we find by the compar|ing their ideas, that thought and motion are different from each other, and by experi|ence, that they are con&s;tantly united; which being all the circum&s;tances, that enter into the idea of cau&s;e and effect, when apply'd to the operations of matter, we may cer|tainly conclude, that motion may be, and actually is, the cau&s;e of thought and per|ception.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems only this dilemma left us in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; either to a&s;&s;ert, that nothing can be the cau&s;e of another, but where
<PB N="432" REF="444">
the mind can perceive the connexion in its idea of the objects: Or to maintain, that all objects, which we find con&s;tantly conjoin'd, are upon that account to be regarded as cau&s;es and effects. If we choo&s;e the fir&s;t part of the dilemma, the&s;e are the con&s;e|quences. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We in reality affirm, that there is no &s;uch thing in the univer&s;e as a cau&s;e or productive principle, not even the deity him&s;elf; &s;ince our idea of that &s;u|preme Being is deriv'd from particular im|pre&s;&s;ions, none of which contain any effi|cacy, nor &s;eem to have <HI>any</HI> connexion with <HI>any</HI> other exi&s;tence. As to what may be &s;aid, that the connexion betwixt the idea of an infinitely powerful being, and that of any effect, which he wills, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary and unavoidable; I an&s;wer, that we have no idea of a being endow'd with any power, much le&s;s of one endow'd with in|finite power. But if we will change ex|pre&s;&s;ions, we can only define power by con|nexion; and then in &s;aying, that the idea of an infinitely powerful being is connected with that of every effect, which he wills, we really do no more than a&s;&s;ert, that a being, who&s;e volition is connected with e|very effect, is connected with every effect; which is an identical propo&s;ition, and gives
<PB N="433" REF="445">
us no in&s;ight into the nature of this power or connexion. But, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing, that the deity were the great and efficacious prin|ciple, which &s;upplies the deficiency of all cau&s;es, this leads us into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impie|ties and ab&s;urdities. For upon the &s;ame ac|count, that we have recour&s;e to him in na|tural operations, and a&s;&s;ert that matter can|not of it&s;elf communicate motion, or pro|duce thought, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e there is no ap|parent connexion betwixt the&s;e objects; I &s;ay, upon the very &s;ame account, we mu&s;t acknowledge that the deity is the author of all our volitions and perceptions; &s;ince they have no more apparent connexion ei|ther with one another, or with the &s;up|pos'd but unknown &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul. This agency of the &s;upreme Being we know to have been a&s;&s;erted by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As father <HI>Malebranche</HI> and other <HI>Carte&s;ians.</HI></NOTE> &s;everal philo&s;o|phers with relation to all the actions of the mind, except volition, or rather an incon&s;i|derable part of volition; tho' 'tis ea&s;y to perceive, that this exception is a mere pre|text, to avoid the dangerous con&s;equences of that doctrine. If nothing be active but what has an apparent power, thought is in no ca&s;e any more active than matter; and if this inactivity mu&s;t make us have recour&s;e to a
<PB N="434" REF="446">
deity, the &s;upreme being is the real cau&s;e of all our actions, bad as well as good, vi|cious as well as virtuous.</P>
<P>THUS we are nece&s;&s;arily reduc'd to the other &s;ide of the dilemma, <HI>viz.</HI> that all ob|jects, which are found to be con&s;tantly con|join'd, are upon that account only to be re|garded as cau&s;es and effects. Now as all objects, which are not contrary, are &s;u&s;cep|tible of a con&s;tant conjunction, and as no real objects are contrary; it follows, that for ought we can determine by the mere ideas, any thing may be the cau&s;e or effect of any thing; which evidently gives the advantage to the materiali&s;ts above their antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>TO PRONOUNCE, then, the final deci|&s;ion upon the whole; the que&s;tion concern|ing the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul is ab&s;olutely unintelligible: All our perceptions are not &s;u&s;ceptible of a local union, either with what is extended or unextended; there being &s;ome of them of the one kind, and &s;ome of the other: And as the con&s;tant conjunction of objects con&s;titutes the very e&s;&s;ence of cau&s;e and effect, matter and motion may often be regarded as the cau&s;es of thought, as far as we have any notion of that rela|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="447">
'TIS certainly a kind of indignity to phi|lo&s;ophy, who&s;e &s;overeign authority ought every where to be acknowledg'd, to oblige her on every occa&s;ion to make apologies for her conclu&s;ions, and ju&s;tify her&s;elf to every particular art and &s;cience, which may be offended at her. This puts one in mind of a king arraign'd for high-trea&s;on again&s;t his &s;ubjects. There is only one occa&s;ion, when philo&s;ophy will think it nece&s;&s;ary and even honourable to ju&s;tify her&s;elf, and that is, when religion may &s;eem to be in the lea&s;t offended; who&s;e rights are as dear to her as her own, and are indeed the &s;ame. If any one, therefore, &s;hou'd imagine that the foregoing arguments are any ways dangerous to religion, I hope the following apology will remove his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>THERE is no foundation for any conclu|&s;ion <HI>a priori,</HI> either concerning the opera|tions or duration of any object, of which 'tis po&s;&s;ible for the human mind to form a conception.

In both ca&s;es the metaphy&s;i|cal arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul are equally inconclu&s;ive; and in both ca&s;es the moral arguments and tho&s;e deriv'd from the analogy of nature are equally &s;trong and convincing. If my philo&s;ophy, therefore, makes no addition to the argu|ments for religion, I have at lea&s;t the &s;atisfac|tion to think it takes nothing from them, but that every thing remains preci&s;ely as before.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. <HI>Of per&s;onal identity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who imagine we are every moment inti|mately con&s;cious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its exi&s;tence and its continuance in exi&s;tence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demon&s;tration, both of its perfect identity and &s;implicity. The &s;trong|e&s;t &s;en&s;ation, the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ay they, in&s;tead of di&s;tracting us from this view, only fix it the more inten&s;ely, and make us con&s;ider their influence on <HI>&s;elf</HI> either by their pain or plea&s;ure. To attempt a farther proof of this were to weaken its evidence; &s;ince no proof can be deriv'd from any fact, of
<PB N="437" REF="449">
which we are &s;o intimately con&s;cious; nor is there any thing, of which we can be cer|tain, if we doubt of this.</P>
<P>UNLUCKILY all the&s;e po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions are contrary to that very experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of <HI>&s;elf,</HI> after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what impre&s;&s;ion cou'd this idea be deriv'd? This que&s;tion 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to an|&s;wer without a manife&s;t contradiction and ab&s;urdity; and yet 'tis a que&s;tion, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an&s;wer'd, if we wou'd have the idea of &s;elf pa&s;s for clear and in|telligible. It mu&s;t be &s;ome one impre&s;&s;ion, that gives ri&s;e to every real idea. But &s;elf or per&s;on is not any one impre&s;&s;ion, but that to which our &s;everal impre&s;&s;ions and ideas are &s;uppos'd to have a reference. If any impre&s;&s;ion gives ri&s;e to the idea of &s;elf, that impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t continue invariably the &s;ame, thro' the whole cour&s;e of our lives; &s;ince &s;elf is &s;uppos'd to exi&s;t after that man|ner. But there is no impre&s;&s;ion con&s;tant and invariable. Pain and plea&s;ure, grief and joy, pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations &s;ucceed each o|ther, and never all exi&s;t at the &s;ame time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, or from any other, that the
<PB N="438" REF="450">
idea of &s;elf is deriv'd; and con&s;equently there is no &s;uch idea.</P>
<P>BUT farther, what mu&s;t become of all our particular perceptions upon this hypo|the&s;is? All the&s;e are different, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hable, and &s;eparable from each other, and may be &s;eparately con&s;ider'd, and may exi&s;t &s;eparately, and have no need of any thing to &s;upport their exi&s;tence. After what man|ner, therefore, do they belong to &s;elf; and how are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter mo&s;t intimately into what I call <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I always &s;tumble on &s;ome par|ticular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or &s;hade, love or hatred, pain or plea|&s;ure. I never can catch <HI>my&s;elf</HI> at any time without a perception, and never can ob&s;erve any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by &s;ound &s;leep; &s;o long am I in&s;en&s;ible of <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and may truly be &s;aid not to exi&s;t. And were all my perceptions remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor &s;ee, nor love, nor hate after the di&s;&s;o|lution of my body, I &s;hou'd be entirely an|nihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requi&s;ite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one upon &s;erious and unprejudic'd reflection, thinks he has a different notion
<PB N="439" REF="451">
of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I can rea&s;on no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are e&s;&s;entially different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive &s;ome|thing &s;imple and continu'd, which he calls <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> tho' I am certain there is no &s;uch principle in me.</P>
<P>BUT &s;etting a&s;ide &s;ome metaphy&s;icians of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the re&s;t of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different percep|tions, which &s;ucceed each other with an in|conceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their &s;ockets without varying our per|ceptions. Our thought is &s;till more variable than our &s;ight; and all our other &s;en&s;es and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there any &s;ingle power of the &s;oul, which remains unalterably the &s;ame, perhaps for one moment. The mind is a kind of the|atre, where &s;everal perceptions &s;ucce&s;&s;ively make their appearance; pa&s;s, re-pa&s;s, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of po&s;tures and &s;ituations. There is properly no <HI>&s;implicity</HI> in it at one time, nor <HI>identity</HI> in different; whatever natural propen&s;ion we may have to imagine that &s;implicity and
<PB N="440" REF="452">
identity. The compari&s;on of the theatre mu&s;t not mi&s;lead us. They are the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive perceptions only, that con&s;titute the mind; nor have we the mo&s;t di&s;tant notion of the place, where the&s;e &s;cenes are repre|&s;ented, or of the materials, of which it is compos'd.</P>
<P>WHAT then gives us &s;o great a propen|&s;ion to a&s;cribe an identity to the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive perceptions, and to &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;t of an invariable and uninterrupted exi&s;tence thro' the whole cour&s;e of our lives? In order to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt per&s;onal identity, as it regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our pa&s;&s;ions or the concern we take in our|&s;elves. The fir&s;t is our pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and to explain it perfectly we mu&s;t take the matter pretty deep, and account for that identity, which we attribute to plants and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt it, and the identity of a &s;elf or per&s;on.</P>
<P>WE have a di&s;tinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted thro' a &s;uppos'd variation of time; and this idea we call that of <HI>identity</HI> or <HI>&s;amene&s;s.</HI> We have al&s;o a di&s;tinct idea of &s;everal different objects exi&s;ting in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and connected together by a clo&s;e relation; and this to an
<PB N="441" REF="453">
accurate view affords as perfect a notion of <HI>diver&s;ity,</HI> as if there was no manner of re|lation among the objects. But tho' the&s;e two ideas of identity, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related objects be in them&s;elves perfectly di&s;|tinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our common way of thinking they are gene|rally confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, by which we con&s;ider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which we reflect on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related objects, are almo&s;t the &s;ame to the feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought requir'd in the latter ca&s;e than in the former. The relation facilitates the tran|&s;ition of the mind from one object to an|other, and renders its pa&s;&s;age as &s;mooth as if it contemplated one continu'd object. This re&s;emblance is the cau&s;e of the confu&s;ion and mi&s;take, and makes us &s;ub&s;titute the notion of identity, in&s;tead of that of related objects. However at one in&s;tant we may con&s;ider the related &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as variable or interrupted, we are &s;ure the next to a&s;cribe to it a perfect identity, and regard it as in|variable and uninterrupted. Our propen&s;ity to this mi&s;take is &s;o great from the re&s;em|blance above-mention'd, that we fall into it before we are aware; and tho' we ince&s;|&s;antly
<PB N="442" REF="454">
correct our&s;elves by reflection, and return to a more accurate method of think|ing, yet we cannot long &s;u&s;tain our philo|&s;ophy, or take off this bia&s;s from the ima|gination. Our la&s;t re&s;ource is to yield to it, and boldly a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e different re|lated objects are in effect the &s;ame, how|ever interrupted and variable. In order to ju&s;tify to our&s;elves this ab&s;urdity, we often feign &s;ome new and unintelligible principle, that connects the objects together, and pre|vents their interruption or variation. Thus we feign the continu'd exi&s;tence of the percep|tions of our &s;en&s;es, to remove the interrup|tion; and run into the notion of a <HI>&s;oul,</HI> and <HI>&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tance,</HI> to di&s;gui&s;e the variation. But we may farther ob&s;erve, that where we do not give ri&s;e to &s;uch a fiction, our pro|pen&s;ion to confound identity with relation is &s;o great, that we are apt to imagine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the reader is de&s;irous to &s;ee how a great genius may be influenc'd by the&s;e &s;eemingly trivial principles of the imagination, as well as the mere vulgar, let him read my Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s rea&s;onings concerning the uniting prin|ciple of the univer&s;e, and the identity of plants and animals.

<P>THUS the controver&s;y concerning iden|tity is not merely a di&s;pute of words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper &s;en&s;e, to variable or interrupted objects, our mi&s;take is not confin'd to the expre&s;&s;ion, but is commonly attended with a fiction, either of &s;omething invariable and uninter|rupted, or of &s;omething my&s;terious and in|explicable, or at lea&s;t with a propen&s;ity to &s;uch fictions. What will &s;uffice to prove this hypothe&s;is to the &s;atisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to &s;hew from daily expe|rience and ob&s;ervation, that the objects, which are variable or interrupted, and yet are &s;uppos'd to continue the &s;ame, are &s;uch only as con&s;i&s;t of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parts, con|nected together by re&s;emblance, contiguity, or cau&s;ation. For as &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion an|&s;wers evidently to our notion of diver&s;ity, it can only be by mi&s;take we a&s;cribe to it an identity; and as the relation of parts, which leads us into this mi&s;take, is really nothing

but a quality, which produces an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, and an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the ima|gination from one to another, it can only be from the re&s;emblance, which this act of the mind bears to that, by which we con|template one continu'd object, that the er|ror ari&s;es. Our chief bu&s;ine&s;s, then, mu&s;t be to prove, that all objects, to which we a&s;cribe identity, without ob&s;erving their in|variablene&s;s and uninterruptedne&s;s, are &s;uch as con&s;i&s;t of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related objects.</P>
<P>IN order to this, &s;uppo&s;e any ma&s;s of matter, of which the parts are contiguous and connected, to be plac'd before us; 'tis plain we mu&s;t attribute a perfect identity to this ma&s;s, provided all the parts continue uninterruptedly and invariably the &s;ame, whatever motion or change of place we may ob&s;erve either in the whole or in any of the parts. But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome very <HI>&s;mall</HI> or <HI>incon&s;iderable</HI> part to be added to the ma&s;s, or &s;ub&s;tracted from it; tho' this ab&s;olutely de&s;troys the identity of the whole, &s;trictly &s;peaking; yet as we &s;eldom think &s;o accurately, we &s;cruple not to pronounce a ma&s;s of matter the &s;ame, where we find &s;o trivial an alteration. The pa&s;&s;age of the thought from the object before the change to the object after it, is &s;o &s;mooth and ea&s;y, that we &s;carce perceive
<PB N="445" REF="457">
the tran&s;ition, and are apt to imagine, that 'tis nothing but a continu'd &s;urvey of the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>THERE is a very remarkable circum|&s;tance, that attends this experiment; which is, that tho' the change of any con&s;iderable part in a ma&s;s of matter de&s;troys the iden|tity of the whole, yet we mu&s;t mea&s;ure the greatne&s;s of the part, not ab&s;olutely, but by its <HI>proportion</HI> to the whole. The addition or diminution of a mountain wou'd not be &s;ufficient to produce a diver&s;ity in a planet; tho' the change of a very few inches wou'd be able to de&s;troy the identity of &s;ome bo|dies. 'Twill be impo&s;&s;ible to account for this, but by reflecting that objects operate upon the mind, and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions not according to their real greatne&s;s, but according to their proportion to each other: And therefore, &s;ince this interruption makes an object cea&s;e to appear the &s;ame, it mu&s;t be the unin|terrupted progre&s;s of the thought, which con&s;titutes the imperfect identity.</P>
<P>THIS may be confirm'd by another phae|nomenon. A change in any con&s;iderable part of a body de&s;troys its identity; but 'tis remarkable, that where the change is pro|duc'd <HI>gradually</HI> and <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly</HI> we are le&s;s apt
<PB N="446" REF="458">
to a&s;cribe to it the &s;ame effect. The rea|&s;on can plainly be no other, than that the mind, in following the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes of the body, feels an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age from the &s;urveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which continu'd percep|tion, it a&s;cribes a continu'd exi&s;tence and identity to the object.</P>
<P>BUT whatever precaution we may u&s;e in introducing the changes gradually, and ma|king them proportionable to the whole, 'tis certain, that where the changes are at la&s;t ob&s;erv'd to become con&s;iderable, we make a &s;cruple of a&s;cribing identity to &s;uch different objects. There is, however, another arti|fice, by which we may induce the imagina|tion to advance a &s;tep farther; and that is, by producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to &s;ome <HI>common end</HI> or purpo&s;e. A &s;hip, of which a con|&s;iderable part has been chang'd by frequent reparations, is &s;till con&s;ider'd as the &s;ame; nor does the difference of the materials hin|der us from a&s;cribing an identity to it. The common end, in which the parts con&s;pire, is the &s;ame under all their variations, and affords
<PB N="447" REF="459">
an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of the imagination from one &s;ituation of the body to another.</P>
<P>BUT this is &s;till more remarkable, when we add a <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> of parts to their <HI>com|mon end,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e that they bear to each other, the reciprocal relation of cau&s;e and effect in all their actions and operations. This is the ca&s;e with all animals and vege|tables; where not only the &s;everal parts have a reference to &s;ome general purpo&s;e, but al&s;o a mutual dependance on, and connexion with each other. The effect of &s;o &s;trong a relation is, that tho' every one mu&s;t allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and animals endure a <HI>total</HI> change, yet we &s;till attribute identity to them, while their form, &s;ize, and &s;ub&s;tance are entirely alter'd. An oak, that grows from a &s;mall plant to a large tree, is &s;till the &s;ame oak; tho' there be not one particle of matter, or figure of its parts the &s;ame. An infant becomes a man, and is &s;ometimes fat, &s;ometimes lean, without any change in his identity.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o con&s;ider the two follow|ing phaenomena, which are remarkable in their kind. The fir&s;t is, that tho' we com|monly be able to di&s;tingui&s;h pretty exactly betwixt numerical and &s;pecific identity, yet it &s;ometimes happens, that we confound
<PB N="448" REF="460">
them, and in our thinking and rea&s;oning employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who hears a noi&s;e, that is frequently inter|rupted and renew'd, &s;ays, it is &s;till the &s;ame noi&s;e; tho' 'tis evident the &s;ounds have only a &s;pecific identity or re&s;emblance, and there is nothing numerically the &s;ame, but the cau&s;e, which produc'd them. In like man|ner it may be &s;aid without breach of the propriety of language, that &s;uch a church, which was formerly of brick, fell to ruin, and that the pari&s;h rebuilt the &s;ame church of free-&s;tone, and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor materials are the &s;ame, nor is there any thing common to the two objects, but their rela|tion to the inhabitants of the pari&s;h; and yet this alone is &s;ufficient to make us de|nominate them the &s;ame. But we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that in the&s;e ca&s;es the fir&s;t object is in a manner annihilated before the &s;econd comes into exi&s;tence; by which means, we are never pre&s;ented in any one point of time with the idea of difference and multi|plicity; and for that rea&s;on are le&s;s &s;cru|pulous in calling them the &s;ame.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, We may remark, that tho' in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of related objects, it be in a manner requi&s;ite, that the change of parts
<PB N="449" REF="461">
be not &s;udden nor entire, in order to pre|&s;erve the identity, yet where the objects are in their nature changeable and incon|&s;tant, we admit of a more &s;udden tran&s;ition, than wou'd otherwi&s;e be con&s;i&s;tent with that relation. Thus as the nature of a river con|&s;i&s;ts in the motion and change of parts; tho' in le&s;s than four and twenty hours the&s;e be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the &s;ame during &s;e|veral ages. What is natural and e&s;&s;ential to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and what is expected makes le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion, and appears of le&s;s moment, than what is un|u&s;ual and extraordinary. A con&s;iderable change of the former kind &s;eems really le&s;s to the imagination, than the mo&s;t trivial al|teration of the latter; and by breaking le&s;s the continuity of the thought, has le&s;s influ|ence in de&s;troying the identity.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to explain the nature of <HI>per&s;onal identity,</HI> which has become &s;o great a que&s;tion in philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially of late years in <HI>England,</HI> where all the ab|&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences are &s;tudy'd with a peculiar ardour and application. And here 'tis evi|dent, the &s;ame method of rea&s;oning mu&s;t be continu'd, which has &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully explain'd the identity of plants, and animals, and
<PB N="450" REF="462">
&s;hips, and hou&s;es, and of all the compound|ed and changeable productions either of art or nature. The identity, which we a&s;cribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we a&s;cribe to vegetables and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but mu&s;t proceed from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.</P>
<P>BUT le&s;t this argument &s;hou'd not con|vince the reader; tho' in my opinion per|fectly deci&s;ive; let him weigh the following rea&s;oning, which is &s;till clo&s;er and more immediate. 'Tis evident, that the identity, which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not able to run the &s;everal different per|ceptions into one, and make them lo&s;e their characters of di&s;tinction and difference, which are e&s;&s;ential to them. 'Tis &s;till true, that every di&s;tinct perception, which enters into the compo&s;ition of the mind, is a di&s;tinct exi&s;tence, and is different, and di&s;tingui&s;ha|ble, and &s;eparable from every other percep|tion, either contemporary or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive. But, as, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;tinction and &s;e|parability, we &s;uppo&s;e the whole train of perceptions to be united by identity, a que|&s;tion naturally ari&s;es concerning this relation
<PB N="451" REF="463">
of identity; whether it be &s;omething that really binds our &s;everal perceptions together, or only a&s;&s;ociates their ideas in the imagi|nation. That is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the identity of a per&s;on, we ob&s;erve &s;ome real bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the ideas we form of them. This que&s;tion we might ea&s;ily decide, if we wou'd re|collect what has been already prov'd at large, that the under&s;tanding never ob&s;erves any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cau&s;e and effect, when &s;trictly examin'd, re&s;olves it&s;elf into a cu&s;|tomary a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that identity is nothing really belonging to the&s;e different percep|tions, and uniting them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to them, becau&s;e of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union in the imagination, are the&s;e three relations above-mention'd. The&s;e are the uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them every di&s;tinct object is &s;eparable by the mind, and may be &s;eparate|ly con&s;ider'd, and appears not to have any more connexion with any other object, than
<PB N="452" REF="464">
if disjoin'd by the greate&s;t difference and re|motene&s;s. 'Tis, therefore, on &s;ome of the&s;e three relations of re&s;emblance, contiguity and cau&s;ation, that identity depends; and as the very e&s;&s;ence of the&s;e relations con&s;i&s;ts in their producing an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas; it follows, that our notions of per&s;onal iden|tity, proceed entirely from the &s;mooth and uninterrupted progre&s;s of the thought along a train of connected ideas, according to the principles above-explain'd.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion, therefore, which re|mains, is, by what relations this uninterrup|ted progre&s;s of our thought is produc'd, when we con&s;ider the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive exi&s;tence of a mind or thinking per&s;on. And here 'tis evident we mu&s;t confine our&s;elves to re|&s;emblance and cau&s;ation, and mu&s;t drop contiguity, which has little or no influence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>TO begin with <HI>re&s;emblance;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e we cou'd &s;ee clearly into the brea&s;t of another, and ob&s;erve that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, which con&s;titutes his mind or thinking prin|ciple, and &s;uppo&s;e that he always pre&s;erves the memory of a con&s;iderable part of pa&s;t perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing cou'd more contribute to the be&s;towing a relation on this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion amid&s;t all its variations.
<PB N="453" REF="465">
For what the memory but a faculty, by which we rai&s;e up the images of pa&s;t per|ceptions? And as an image nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;embles its object, mu&s;t not the frequent placing of the&s;e re&s;embling perceptions in the chain of thought, convey the imagina|tion more ea&s;ily from one link to another, and make the whole &s;eem like the continu|ance of one object? In this particular, then, the memory not only di&s;covers the identity, but al&s;o contributes to its production, by producing the relation of re&s;emblance among the perceptions. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame whether we con&s;ider our&s;elves or others.</P>
<P>As to <HI>cau&s;ation;</HI> we may ob&s;erve, that the true idea of the human mind, is to con|&s;ider it as a &s;y&s;tem of different perceptions or different exi&s;tences, which are link'd to|gether by the relation of cau&s;e and effect, and mutually produce, de&s;troy, influence, and modify each other. Our impre&s;&s;ions give ri&s;e to their corre&s;pondent ideas; and the&s;e ideas in their turn produce other im|pre&s;&s;ions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a third, by which it is ex|pell'd in its turn. In this re&s;pect, I cannot compare the &s;oul more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the &s;everal members are united by
<PB N="454" REF="466">
the reciprocal ties of government and &s;ub|ordination, and give ri&s;e to other per&s;ons, who propagate the &s;ame republic in the in|ce&s;&s;ant changes of its parts. And as the &s;ame individual republic may not only change its members, but al&s;o its laws and con|&s;titutions; in like manner the &s;ame per&s;on may vary his character and di&s;po&s;ition, as well as his impre&s;&s;ions and ideas, without lo&s;ing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his &s;everal parts are &s;till connect|ed by the relation of cau&s;ation. And in this view our identity with regard to the pa&s;|&s;ions &s;erves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making our di&s;tant perceptions influence each other, and by giv|ing us a pre&s;ent concern for our pa&s;t or future pains or plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>As memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, 'tis to be con&s;ider'd, upon that account chiefly, as the &s;ource of per&s;onal identity. Had we no memory, we never &s;hou'd have any notion of cau&s;ation, nor con&s;equently of that chain of cau&s;es and effects, which con&s;titute our &s;elf or per&s;on. But having once acquir'd this notion of cau|&s;ation from the memory, we can extend the &s;ame chain of cau&s;es, and con&s;equently
<PB N="455" REF="467">
the identity of our per&s;ons beyond our me|mory, and can comprehend times, and cir|cum&s;tances, and actions, which we have entirely forgot, but &s;uppo&s;e in general to have exi&s;ted. For how few of our pa&s;t ac|tions are there, of which we have any me|mory? Who can tell me, for in&s;tance, what were his thoughts and actions on the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1715, the 11th of <HI>March</HI> 1719, and the 3d of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1733? Or will he affirm, becau&s;e he has entirely forgot the incidents of the&s;e days, that the pre&s;ent &s;elf is not the &s;ame per&s;on with the &s;elf of that time; and by that means overturn all the mo&s;t e|&s;tabli&s;h'd notions of per&s;onal identity? In this view, therefore, memory does not &s;o much <HI>produce</HI> as <HI>di&s;cover</HI> per&s;onal identity, by &s;hewing us the relation of cau&s;e and ef|fect among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on tho&s;e, who affirm that me|mory produces entirely our per&s;onal identi|ty, to give a rea&s;on why we can thus extend our identity beyond our memory.</P>
<P>THE whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclu&s;ion, which is of great impor|tance in the pre&s;ent affair, <HI>viz.</HI> that all the nice and &s;ubtile que&s;tions concerning per&s;o|nal identity can never po&s;&s;ibly be decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammati|cal
<PB N="456" REF="468">
than as philo&s;ophical difficulties. Iden|tity depends on the relations of ideas; and the&s;e relations produce identity, by means of that ea&s;y tran&s;ition they occa&s;ion. But as the relations, and the ea&s;ine&s;s of the tran&s;i|tion may dimini&s;h by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, we have no ju&s;t &s;tandard, by which we can decide any di&s;pute concerning the time, when they acquire or lo&s;e a title to the name of identity. All the di&s;putes concern|ing the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except &s;o far as the relation of parts gives ri&s;e to &s;ome fiction or imagi|nary principle of union, as we have already ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>WHAT I have &s;aid concerning the fir&s;t origin and uncertainty of our notion of iden|tity, as apply'd to the human mind, may be extended with little or no variation to that of <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> An object, who&s;e dif|ferent co-exi&s;tent parts are bound together by a clo&s;e relation, operates upon the ima|gination after much the &s;ame manner as one perfectly &s;imple and indivi&s;ible, and requires not a much greater &s;tretch of thought in order to its conception. From this &s;imila|rity of operation we attribute a &s;implicity to it, and feign a principle of union as the &s;upport of this &s;implicity, and the center
<PB N="457" REF="469">
of all the different parts and qualities of the object.</P>
<P>THUS we have fini&s;h'd our examination of the &s;everal &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, both of the intellectual and moral world; and in our mi&s;cellaneous way of rea&s;oning have been led into &s;everal topics; which will either illu&s;trate and confirm &s;ome pre|ceding part of this di&s;cour&s;e, or prepare the way for our following opinions. 'Tis now time to return to a more clo&s;e examination of our &s;ubject, and to proceed in the accu|rate anatomy of human nature, having fully explain'd the nature of our judgment and under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>BUT before I launch out into tho&s;e im|men&s;e depths of philo&s;ophy, which lie before me, I find my&s;elf inclin'd to &s;top a moment in my pre&s;ent &s;tation, and to ponder that voyage, which I have under|taken, and which undoubtedly requires the utmo&s;t art and indu&s;try to be brought to a happy conclu&s;ion. Methinks I am like a man, who having &s;truck on many &s;hoals,
<PB N="458" REF="470">
and having narrowly e&s;cap'd &s;hip-wreck in pa&s;&s;ing a &s;mall frith, has yet the temerity to put out to &s;ea in the &s;ame leaky wea|ther-beaten ve&s;&s;el, and even carries his am|bition &s;o far as to think of compa&s;&s;ing the globe under the&s;e di&s;advantageous circum|&s;tances. My memory of pa&s;t errors and perplexities, makes me diffident for the fu|ture. The wretched condition, weakne&s;s, and di&s;order of the faculties, I mu&s;t employ in my enquiries, encrea&s;e my apprehen|&s;ions. And the impo&s;&s;ibility of amending or correcting the&s;e faculties, reduces me almo&s;t to de&s;pair, and makes me re&s;olve to peri&s;h on the barren rock, on which I am at pre&s;ent, rather than venture my&s;elf upon that boundle&s;s ocean, which runs out into immen&s;ity. This &s;udden view of my danger &s;trikes me with melancholy; and as 'tis u&s;ual for that pa&s;&s;ion, above all others, to indulge it&s;elf; I cannot forbear feeding my de&s;pair, with all tho&s;e de&s;ponding re|flections, which the pre&s;ent &s;ubject furni&s;hes me with in &s;uch abundance.</P>
<P>I AM fir&s;t affrighted and confounded with that forelorn &s;olitude, in which I am plac'd in my philo&s;ophy, and fancy my&s;elf &s;ome &s;trange uncouth mon&s;ter, who not being able to mingle and unite in &s;ociety, has
<PB N="459" REF="471">
been expell'd all human commerce, and left utterly abandon'd and di&s;con&s;olate. Fain wou'd I run into the crowd for &s;helter and warmth; but cannot prevail with my&s;elf to mix with &s;uch deformity. I call upon others to join me, in order to make a com|pany apart; but no one will hearken to me. Every one keeps at a di&s;tance, and dreads that &s;torm, which beats upon me from every &s;ide. I have expos'd my&s;elf to the enmity of all metaphy&s;icians, logicians, mathema|ticians, and even theologians; and can I wonder at the in&s;ults I mu&s;t &s;uffer? I have declar'd my di&s;-approbation of their &s;y&s;tems; and can I be &s;urpriz'd, if they &s;hou'd ex|pre&s;s a hatred of mine and of my per&s;on? When I look abroad, I fore&s;ee on every &s;ide, di&s;pute, contradiction, anger, calumny and detraction. When I turn my eye in|ward, I find nothing but doubt and igno|rance. All the world con&s;pires to oppo&s;e and contradict me; tho' &s;uch is my weak|ne&s;s, that I feel all my opinions loo&s;en and fall of them&s;elves, when un&s;upported by the approbation of others. Every &s;tep I take is with he&s;itation, and every new reflection makes me dread an error and ab&s;urdity in my rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="472">
FOR with what confidence can I venture upon &s;uch bold enterprizes, when be&s;ide tho&s;e numberle&s;s infirmities peculiar to my|&s;elf, I find &s;o many which are common to human nature? Can I be &s;ure, that in leav|ing all e&s;tabli&s;h'd opinions I am following truth; and by what criterion &s;hall I di&s;tin|gui&s;h her, even if fortune &s;hou'd at la&s;t guide me on her foot-&s;teps? After the mo&s;t accu|rate and exact of my rea&s;onings, I can give no rea&s;on why I &s;hou'd a&s;&s;ent to it; and feel nothing but a <HI>&s;trong</HI> propen&s;ity to con|&s;ider objects <HI>&s;trongly</HI> in that view, under which they appear to me. Experience is a principle, which in&s;tructs me in the &s;everal conjunctions of objects for the pa&s;t. Habit is another principle, which determines me to expect the &s;ame for the future; and both of them con&s;piring to operate upon the ima|gination, make me form certain ideas in a more inten&s;e and lively manner, than others, which are not attended with the &s;ame ad|vantages. Without this quality, by which the mind enlivens &s;ome ideas beyond others (which &s;eemingly is &s;o trivial, and &s;o little founded on rea&s;on) we cou'd never a&s;&s;ent to any argument, nor carry our view be|yond tho&s;e few objects, which are pre&s;ent to our &s;en&s;es. Nay, even to the&s;e ob|jects

we cou'd never attribute any exi&s;tence, but what was dependent on the &s;en&s;es; and mu&s;t comprehend them entirely in that &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, which con&s;titutes our &s;elf or per&s;on. Nay farther, even with re|lation to that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, we cou'd only ad|mit of tho&s;e perceptions, which are imme|diately pre&s;ent to our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, nor cou'd tho&s;e lively images, with which the memory pre&s;ents us, be ever receiv'd as true pictures of pa&s;t perceptions. The memory, &s;en&s;es, and under&s;tanding are, therefore, all of them founded on the imagination, or the vivacity of our ideas.</P>
<P>NO wonder a principle &s;o incon&s;tant and fallacious &s;hou'd lead us into errors, when implicitely follow'd (as it mu&s;t be) in all its variations. 'Tis this princple, which makes us rea&s;on from cau&s;es and effects; and 'tis the &s;ame principle, which convinces us of the continu'd exi&s;tence of external objects, when ab&s;ent from the &s;en&s;es. But tho' the&s;e two operations be equally natural and ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the human mind, yet in &s;ome circum&s;tances they are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 4.</NOTE> directly contrary, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us to rea&s;on ju&s;tly and regularly from cau&s;es and effects, and at the &s;ame time believe the continu'd exi&s;tence of

Sect. 14.</NOTE> contradiction wou'd be more ex|cu&s;able, were it compen&s;ated by any degree of &s;olidity and &s;atisfaction in the other parts of our rea&s;oning. But the ca&s;e is quite con|trary. When we trace up the human un|der&s;tanding to its fir&s;t principles, we find it to lead us into &s;uch &s;entiments, as &s;eem to turn into ridicule all our pa&s;t pains and indu&s;try, and to di&s;courage us from future enquiries. Nothing is more curiou&s;ly enquir'd after by the mind of man, than the cau&s;es of every phaenomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate cau&s;es, but pu&s;h on our enquiries, till we arrive at the ori|ginal and ultimate principle. We wou'd not willingly &s;top before we are acquainted with that energy in the cau&s;e, by which it operates on its effect; that tie, which con|nects them together; and that efficacious quality, on which the tie depends. This
<PB N="463" REF="475">
is our aim in all our &s;tudies and reflections: And how mu&s;t we be di&s;appointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or ener|gy lies merely in our&s;elves, and is nothing but that determination of the mind, which is acquir'd by cu&s;tom, and cau&s;es us to make a tran&s;ition from an object to its u|&s;ual attendant, and from the impre&s;&s;ion of one to the lively idea of the other? Such a di&s;covery not only cuts off all hope of ever attaining &s;atisfaction, but even prevents our very wi&s;hes; &s;ince it appears, that when we &s;ay we de&s;ire to know the ultimate and operating principle, as &s;omething, which re|&s;ides in the external object, we either con|tradict our&s;elves, or talk without a mean|ing.</P>
<P>THIS deficiency in our ideas is not, in|deed, perceiv'd in common life, nor are we &s;en&s;ible, that in the mo&s;t u&s;ual conjunctions of cau&s;e and effect we are as ignorant of the ultimate principle, which binds them toge|ther, as in the mo&s;t unu&s;ual and extraor|dinary. But this proceeds merely from an illu&s;ion of the imagination; and the que&s;tion is, how far we ought to yield to the&s;e il|lu&s;ions. This que&s;tion is very difficult, and reduces us to a very dangerous dilemma, which-ever way we an&s;wer it. For if we
<PB N="464" REF="476">
a&s;&s;ent to every trivial &s;ugge&s;tion of the fancy; be&s;ide that the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are often con|trary to each other; they lead us into &s;uch errors, ab&s;urdities, and ob&s;curities, that we mu&s;t at la&s;t become a&s;ham'd of our credu|lity. Nothing is more dangerous to rea&s;on than the flights of the imagination, and no|thing has been the occa&s;ion of more mi&s;|takes among philo&s;ophers. Men of bright fancies may in this re&s;pect be compar'd to tho&s;e angels, whom the &s;cripture repre&s;ents as covering their eyes with their wings. This has already appear'd in &s;o many in|&s;tances, that we may &s;pare our&s;elves the trouble of enlarging upon it any farther.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, if the con&s;ide|ration of the&s;e in&s;tances makes us take a re&s;olution to reject all the trivial &s;ugge&s;tions of the fancy, and adhere to the under&s;tand|ing, that is, to the general and more e&s;|tabli&s;h'd properties of the imagination; even this re&s;olution, if &s;teadily executed, wou'd be dangerous, and attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. For I have already &s;hewn,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 1.</NOTE> that the under&s;tanding, when it acts alone, and according to its mo&s;t general principles, entirely &s;ubverts it&s;elf, and leaves not the lowe&s;t degree of evidence in any
<PB N="465" REF="477">
propo&s;ition, either in philo&s;ophy or com|mon life. We &s;ave our&s;elves from this to|tal &s;ceptici&s;m only by means of that &s;in|gular and &s;eemingly trivial property of the fancy, by which we enter with difficulty into remote views of things, and are not able to accompany them with &s;o &s;en&s;ible an impre&s;&s;ion, as we do tho&s;e, which are more ea&s;y and natural. Shall we, then, e&s;|tabli&s;h it for a general maxim, that no re|fin'd or elaborate rea&s;oning is ever to be re|ceiv'd? Con&s;ider well the con&s;equences of &s;uch a principle. By this means you cut off entirely all &s;cience and philo&s;ophy: You proceed upon one &s;ingular quality of the imagination, and by a parity of rea&s;on mu&s;t embrace all of them: And you expre&s;ly contradict your&s;elf; &s;ince this maxim mu&s;t be built on the preceding rea&s;oning, which will be allow'd to be &s;ufficiently refin'd and metaphy&s;ical. What party, then, &s;hall we choo&s;e among the&s;e difficulties? If we em|brace this principle, and condemn all re|fin'd rea&s;oning, we run into the mo&s;t ma|nife&s;t ab&s;urdities. If we reject it in favour of the&s;e rea&s;onings, we &s;ubvert entirely the human under&s;tanding. We have, therefore, no choice left but betwixt a fal&s;e rea&s;on and none at all. For my part, I know not
<PB N="466" REF="478">
ought to be done in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I can only ob&s;erve what is commonly done; which is, that this difficulty is &s;eldom or never thought of; and even where it has once been pre&s;ent to the mind, is quickly forgot, and leaves but a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion behind it. Very refin'd reflections have little or no in|fluence upon us; and yet we do not, and cannot e&s;tabli&s;h it for a rule, that they ought not to have any influence; which implies a manife&s;t contradiction.</P>
<P>BUT what have I here &s;aid, that reflec|tions very refin'd and metaphy&s;ical have lit|tle or no influence upon us? This opinion I can &s;carce forbear retracting, and condemn|ing from my pre&s;ent feeling and experience. The <HI>inten&s;e</HI> view of the&s;e manifold contra|dictions and imperfections in human rea&s;on has &s;o wrought upon me, and heated my brain, that I am ready to reject all belief and rea&s;oning, and can look upon no opi|nion even as more probable or likely than another. Where am I, or what? From what cau&s;es do I derive my exi&s;tence, and to what condition &s;hall I return? Who&s;e fa|vour &s;hall I court, and who&s;e anger mu&s;t I dread? What beings &s;urround me? and on whom have I any influence, or who have any influence on me? I am confound|ed
<PB N="467" REF="479">
with all the&s;e que&s;tions, and begin to fancy my&s;elf in the mo&s;t deplorable condi|tion imaginable, inviron'd with the deepe&s;t darkne&s;s, and utterly depriv'd of the u&s;e of every member and faculty.</P>
<P>MOST fortunately it happens, that &s;ince rea&s;on is incapable of di&s;pelling the&s;e clouds, nature her&s;elf &s;uffices to that purpo&s;e, and cures me of this philo&s;ophical melancholy and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by &s;ome avocation, and lively impre&s;&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es, which obliterate all the&s;e chimeras. I dine, I play a game of back-gammon, I conver&s;e, and am merry with my friends; and when after three or four hour's amu&s;ement, I wou'd return to the&s;e &s;peculations, they appear &s;o cold, and &s;train'd, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther.</P>
<P>HERE then I find my&s;elf ab&s;olutely and nece&s;&s;arily determin'd to live, and talk, and act like other people in the common affairs of life. But notwith&s;tanding that my na|tural propen&s;ity, and the cour&s;e of my ani|mal &s;pirits and pa&s;&s;ions reduce me to this indolent belief in the general maxims of the world, I &s;till feel &s;uch remains of my for|mer di&s;po&s;ition, that I am ready to throw all my books and papers into the fire, and re|&s;olve
<PB N="468" REF="480">
never more to renounce the plea&s;ures of life for the &s;ake of rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy. For tho&s;e are my &s;entiments in that &s;ple|netic humour, which governs me at pre&s;ent. I may, nay I mu&s;t yield to the current of nature, in &s;ubmitting to my &s;en&s;es and under|&s;tanding; and in this blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I &s;hew mo&s;t perfectly my &s;ceptical di&s;po&s;ition and principles. But does it follow, that I mu&s;t &s;trive again&s;t the current of nature, which leads me to indolence and plea&s;ure; that I mu&s;t &s;eclude my&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from the commerce and &s;ociety of men, which is &s;o agreeable; and that I mu&s;t torture my brain with &s;ubtilities and &s;ophi&s;tries, at the very time that I cannot &s;atisfy my&s;elf con|cerning the rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;o painful an application, nor have any tolerable pro&s;pect of arriving by its means at truth and cer|tainty. Under what obligation do I lie of making &s;uch an abu&s;e of time? And to what end can it &s;erve either for the &s;ervice of mankind, or for my own private intere&s;t? No: If I mu&s;t be a fool, as all tho&s;e who rea&s;on or believe any thing <HI>certainly</HI> are, my follies &s;hall at lea&s;t be natural and agree|able. Where I &s;trive again&s;t my inclina|tion, I &s;hall have a good rea&s;on for my re&s;i&s;tance; and will no more be led a wan|dering
<PB N="469" REF="481">
into &s;uch dreary &s;olitudes, and rough pa&s;&s;ages, as I have hitherto met with.</P>
<P>THESE are the &s;entiments of my &s;pleen and indolence; and indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that philo&s;ophy has nothing to oppo&s;e to them, and expects a victory more from the returns of a &s;erious good-humour'd di&s;|po&s;ition, than from the force of rea&s;on and conviction. In all the incidents of life we ought &s;till to pre&s;erve our &s;ceptici&s;m. If we believe, that fire warms, or water re|fre&s;hes, 'tis only becau&s;e it co&s;ts us too much pains to think otherwi&s;e. Nay if we are philo&s;ophers, it ought only to be upon &s;cepti|cal principles, and from an inclination, which we feel to the employing our&s;elves after that manner. Where rea&s;on is lively, and mixes it&s;elf with &s;ome propen&s;ity, it ought to be a&s;&s;ented to. Where it does not, it never can have any title to operate upon us.</P>
<P>AT the time, therefore, that I am tir'd with amu&s;ement and company, and have indulg'd a <HI>reverie</HI> in my chamber, or in a &s;olitary walk by a river-&s;ide, I feel my mind all collected within it&s;elf, and am naturally <HI>inclin'd</HI> to carry my view into all tho&s;e &s;ubjects, about which I have met with &s;o many di&s;putes in the cour&s;e of my reading and conver&s;ation. I cannot forbear having
<PB N="470" REF="482">
a curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the prin|ciples of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation of government, and the cau&s;e of tho&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, which actuate and govern me. I am un|ea&s;y to think I approve of one object, and di&s;approve of another; call one thing beau|tiful, and another deform'd; decide con|cerning truth and fal&s;hood, rea&s;on and folly, without knowing upon what principles I proceed. I am concern'd for the condition of the learned world, which lies under &s;uch a deplorable ignorance in all the&s;e particulars. I feel an ambition to ari&s;e in me of contri|buting to the in&s;truction of mankind, and of acquiring a name by my inventions and di&s;coveries. The&s;e &s;entiments &s;pring up na|turally in my pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;hou'd I endeavour to bani&s;h them, by attaching my&s;elf to any other bu&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ion, I <HI>feel</HI> I &s;hou'd be a lo&s;er in point of plea|&s;ure; and this is the origin of my philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>BUT even &s;uppo&s;e this curio&s;ity and am|bition &s;hou'd not tran&s;port me into &s;pecu|lations without the &s;phere of common life, it wou'd nece&s;&s;arily happen, that from my very weakne&s;s I mu&s;t be led into &s;uch en|quiries. 'Tis certain, that &s;uper&s;tition is
<PB N="471" REF="483">
much more bold in its &s;y&s;tems and hypo|the&s;es than philo&s;ophy; and while the latter contents it&s;elf with a&s;&s;igning new cau&s;es and principles to the phaenomena, which appear in the vi&s;ible world, the former opens a world of its own, and pre&s;ents us with &s;cenes, and beings, and objects, which are altogether new. Since therefore 'tis al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the mind of man to re&s;t, like tho&s;e of bea&s;ts, in that narrow circle of objects, which are the &s;ubject of daily con|ver&s;ation and action, we ought only to de|liberate concerning the choice of our guide, and ought to prefer that which is &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable. And in this repect I make bold to recommend philo&s;ophy, and &s;hall not &s;cruple to give it the preference to &s;uper&s;tition of every kind or denomination. For as &s;uper&s;tition ari&s;es naturally and ea&s;ily from the popular opinions of mankind, it &s;eizes more &s;trongly on the mind, and is often able to di&s;turb us in the conduct of our lives and actions. Philo&s;ophy on the contrary, if ju&s;t, can pre&s;ent us only with mild and moderate &s;entiments; and if fal&s;e and extravagant, its opinions are merely the objects of a cold and general &s;peculation, and &s;eldom go &s;o far as to interrupt the cour&s;e of our natural propen&s;ities. The CYNICS
<PB N="472" REF="484">
are an extraordinary in&s;tance of philo&s;ophers, who from rea&s;onings purely philo&s;ophical ran into as great extravagancies of conduct as any <HI>Monk</HI> or <HI>Dervi&s;e</HI> that ever was in the world. Generally &s;peaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; tho&s;e in philo|&s;ophy only ridiculous.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e two ca&s;es of the &s;trength and weakne&s;s of the mind will not comprehend all mankind, and that there are in <HI>England,</HI> in particular, many hone&s;t gentlemen, who being always employ'd in their dome&s;tic affairs, or amu&s;ing them&s;elves in common recreations, have carried their thoughts very little beyond tho&s;e objects, which are every day expos'd to their &s;en&s;es. And indeed, of &s;uch as the&s;e I pretend not to make philo&s;ophers, nor do I expect them either to be a&s;&s;ociates in the&s;e re&s;earches or auditors of the&s;e di&s;coveries. They do well to keep them&s;elves in their pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation; and in&s;tead of refining them into philo&s;ophers, I wi&s;h we cou'd communi|cate to our founders of &s;y&s;tems, a &s;hare of this gro&s;s earthy mixture, as an ingredient, which they commonly &s;tand much in need of, and which wou'd &s;erve to temper tho&s;e fiery particles, of which they are compos'd. While a warm imagination is allow'd to en|ter
<PB N="473" REF="485">
into philo&s;ophy, and hypothe&s;es embrac'd merely for being &s;pecious and agreeable, we can never have any &s;teady principles, nor any &s;entiments, which will &s;uit with common practice and experience. But were the&s;e hypothe&s;es once remov'd, we might hope to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem or &s;et of opinions, which if not true (for that, perhaps, is too much to be hop'd for) might at lea&s;t be &s;ati&s;|factory to the human mind, and might &s;tand the te&s;t of the mo&s;t critical examination. Nor &s;hou'd we de&s;pair of attaining this end, becau&s;e of the many chimerical &s;y&s;tems, which have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;en and decay'd away among men, wou'd we con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of that period, wherein the&s;e que&s;tions have been the &s;ubjects of enquiry and rea&s;oning. Two thou&s;and years with &s;uch long inter|ruptions, and under &s;uch mighty di&s;cou|ragements are a &s;mall &s;pace of time to give any tolerable perfection to the &s;ciences; and perhaps we are &s;till in too early an age of the world to di&s;coyer any princi|ples, which will bear the examination of the late&s;t po&s;terity. For my part, my only hope is, that I may contribute a little to the advancement of knowledge, by giving in &s;ome particulars a different turn to the &s;peculations of philo&s;ophers, and pointing
<PB N="474" REF="486">
out to them more di&s;tinctly tho&s;e &s;ubjects, where alone they can expect a&s;&s;urance and conviction. Human Nature is the only &s;ci|ence of man; and yet has been hitherto the mo&s;t neglected. 'Twill be &s;ufficient for me, if I can bring it a little more into fa&s;hion; and the hope of this &s;erves to com|po&s;e my temper from that &s;pleen, and in|vigorate it from that indolence, which &s;ome|times prevail upon me. If the reader finds him&s;elf in the &s;ame ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, let him follow me in my future &s;peculations. If not, let him follow his inclination, and wait the returns of application and good hu|mour. The conduct of a man, who &s;tu|dies philo&s;ophy in this carele&s;s manner, is more truly &s;ceptical than that of one, who feeling in him&s;elf an inclination to it, is yet &s;o over-whelm'd with doubts and &s;cru|ples, as totally to reject it. A true &s;ceptic will be diffident of his philo&s;ophical doubts, as well as of his philo&s;ophical conviction; and will never refu&s;e any innocent &s;atisfac|tion, which offers it&s;elf, upon account of either of them.</P>
<P>NOR is it only proper we &s;hou'd in ge|neral indulge our inclination in the mo&s;t elaborate philo&s;ophical re&s;earches, notwith|&s;tanding our &s;ceptical principles, but al&s;o
<PB N="475" REF="487">
that we &s;hou'd yield to that propen&s;ity, which inclines us to be po&s;itive and certain in <HI>particular points,</HI> according to the light, in which we &s;urvey them in any <HI>particu|lar in&s;tant.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;ier to forbear all exa|mination and enquiry, than to check our|&s;elves in &s;o natural a propen&s;ity, and guard again&s;t that a&s;&s;urance, which always ari&s;es from an exact and full &s;urvey of an object. On &s;uch an occa&s;ion we are apt not only to forget our &s;ceptici&s;m, but even our mo|de&s;ty too; and make u&s;e of &s;uch terms as the&s;e, <HI>'tis evident, 'tis certain, 'tis undeniable;</HI> which a due deference to the public ought, perhaps, to prevent. I may have fallen in|to this fault after the example of others; but I here enter a <HI>caveat</HI> again&s;t any ob|jections, which may be offer'd on that head; and declare that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions were extorted from me by the pre&s;ent view of the object, and imply no dogmatical &s;pirit, nor conceited idea of my own judgment, which are &s;entiments that I am &s;en&s;ible can become no body, and a &s;ceptic &s;till le&s;s than any other.</P>
