<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THIS Tran&s;lation was at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd as an Amu&s;e|ment, without any Intenti|on of making it publick; the Tran&s;lator not pre&s;um|ing to &s;ucceed in the Deli|cacy and Politene&s;s of a Dialect peculiar to</HI> Heroi&s;m; <HI>but as the Counte&s;s</HI> D' Aunois <HI>is the Author of this Piece, and as mo&s;t of her Works have had the good Fortune to meet with a favourable Reception, he was induc'd to hope it might obtain the like Suc|ce&s;s: Be&s;ides, he wou'd not have ventur'd to deliver it to the Pre&s;s, had he not con&s;ult|ed with &s;ome judicious Per&s;ons, who had read the Original in</HI> French, <HI>and were pleas'd to honour it with their Sanction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It mu&s;t be own'd at the &s;ame time, that this is not a Literal Tran&s;lation; for tho' in</HI>
<PB REF="4">
<HI>the</HI> French, <HI>the Characters are well drawn, and the Adventures agreeably related, it was thought proper to retrench &s;ome &s;urperfluous Repetiti|ons, which are frequently remark'd in Stories, of this Nature, written in that Language.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the la&s;t Incident, which is the Murder of</HI> Leonida, <HI>&s;ucceeded by the Mar|riage of the Prince of</HI> Carency <HI>to another Lady; that Circum&s;tance with the Con|clu&s;ion is entirely alter'd; and it's pre&s;um'd, that tho&s;e, who &s;hall take the Trouble of com|paring this with the Original, will approve the De&s;ign, &s;ince it &s;eems unrea&s;onable, that</HI> Leonida, <HI>who was a Perfection of Virtue and Beauty, &s;hou'd die a tragick Death; and that the Prince of</HI> Carency, <HI>who was &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionatly in Love with her, &s;hou'd, after her cruel Fate, conceive tender Sentiments for any other Lady, a Character not becoming a Hero. However, if the Publick &s;hou'd cen|&s;ure this Opinion, the Tran&s;lator mu&s;t then &s;ubmit to their unque&s;tion'd Judgment; and he humbly hopes, that in Con&s;ideration this is his fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, they will out of their Candor and good Nature, pardon whatever Fault they find in the Attempt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Prince of <HI>CARENCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> Daughter of Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> cou'd not, without the greate&s;t Concern, &s;ee Don <HI>John</HI>'s Acce&s;&s;ion to a Throne where &s;he &s;hou'd have been plac'd, were not her Father's Misfortunes the unhappy Cau&s;e. She very much &s;ollicited the Duke her Husband to declare War again&s;t him, which he was inclin'd to, only waited for a favourable Occa&s;ion of making an Alliance.</P>
<P>At this Juncture, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Portu|gal</HI> (who often had Differences about Matters of Intere&s;t with the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile)</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> an Opportunity of decla|ring his Intentions, and &s;ent to him, de&s;iring he wou'd join with him in the Conque&s;t of their common Enemy: The Duke, without delay, &s;et out with a con&s;iderable Number of
<PB N="2" REF="6">
Forces, and took with him his Wife and Three Daughters: The&s;e Ladies were very beautiful, and the Younge&s;t, who&s;e Name was <HI>Catherine,</HI> being the only Daughter of his &s;econd Mar|riage, had Preten&s;ions to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> by Right of the Dutche&s;s her Mother, who was Heire&s;s to that Dominion.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> finding that two &s;uch potent Enemies had declared again&s;t him, ap|ply'd to his Allies, but more particularly to <HI>Charles</HI> the VIth King of <HI>France,</HI> to whom he already owed many Obligations. That Prince &s;ent him Men and Money, and Fortune decla|ring in his Favour, he defeated the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in &s;everal Engagements. The Sick|ne&s;s produc'd by the Climate, was even more de&s;tructive to them than his Arms; but ha|ving weighty Rea&s;ons to wi&s;h for Peace, and knowing that the Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> had left the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> with &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t, he &s;ent the Prior of <HI>Guadalupe</HI> to him at <HI>Bayonne</HI> with con&s;iderable Offers, and a Propo&s;al of Marriage between his Son <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>A|&s;turias,</HI> and the Prince&s;s <HI>Catherine,</HI> Daughter of the Duke, which he repre&s;ented to be the only Means of placing her on the Throne of <HI>Spain;</HI> and at the &s;ame Time promis'd he &s;hou'd have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with their Alliance.</P>
<P>The Duke receiv'd with Plea&s;ure this Over|ture of Peace, being in all re&s;pects agreeable to his Intere&s;t; and the King's Amba&s;&s;adors perform'd the Ceremony of Marriage at <HI>Bayonne.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="7">
The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> left <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> to con|duct her Daughter to <HI>Medina del Campo,</HI> where the King receiv'd them with all the Magni|ficence imaginable. She there pre&s;ented him in the Name of the Duke her Husband, with a Crown of Gold embelli&s;h'd with Jewels, and told him with a maje&s;tick Air, that &s;ince &s;he had yielded to him the Right &s;he had to the Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> it was but ju&s;t he &s;hou'd receive the Crown from the Duke her Lord. The King an&s;wer'd, that he only accepted of it with a De&s;ign of putting it on the Prin|ce&s;s's Head, as &s;oon as his Son &s;hou'd be of Age; the young Prince being then but Ten Years old.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> remain'd all this Time at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> tho' he pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h'd to &s;ee the King, that he might endeavour to di&s;|ingage him from the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t: But the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarch was too &s;en&s;ible of the Ser|vices he had receiv'd, to have any wrong Pro|ceedings with the King of <HI>France</HI> in &s;uch a Con|juncture, therefore declined the Interview which the Duke de&s;ired; and being indi&s;pos'd at <HI>Burgos,</HI> took Leave of the Dutche&s;s in that Place.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the VIth, being inform'd of the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>'s Conduct in what related to him, thought him&s;elf &s;o highly oblig'd, that he cho&s;e <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI> Count of <HI>La March,</HI> his Kin&s;|man, as Amba&s;&s;ador to that Prince; who had Orders to tell him, that he &s;hou'd ever em|brace all Occa&s;ions of expre&s;&s;ing his Gratitude
<PB N="4" REF="8">
for the Value he was pleas'd to &s;et on their Alliance. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> was more capable than any of making known the Sen|timents of his King, being of the fir&s;t Rank by his Birth and Fortune, and by his great Qualities e&s;teemed one of the fine&s;t Gentle|men of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>After having acquitted him&s;elf of his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> he contracted a Friend&s;hip with Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> who had married a <HI>French</HI> Lady, Daughter of <HI>Ar|nauld</HI> of <HI>Solier.</HI> She had for her Fortune the City of <HI>Vilalpendo,</HI> which is one of the great|e&s;t in <HI>Ca&s;tile. Vela&s;co</HI> by his Birth, yielded to none but Princes of the Blood, and his Merit was equally great. Dona <HI>Maria</HI> his Wife, preferr'd the <HI>French</HI> to all other Nations, and in&s;pired her Husband with the &s;ame Sentiments. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> had already &s;o great an E&s;teem for them, that con&s;idering their va&s;t Fortune was to be inherited by an only Daugh|ter, he re&s;olv'd to propo&s;e a Marriage between her and <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> the younge&s;t of his Sons.</P>
<P>Having meditated &s;ometime on this Affair, he vi&s;ited Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> and among o|ther things told him, He had three Sons, that the King his Ma&s;ter had provided for the Two elde&s;t, and that the Younge&s;t was &s;till at his Di&s;po&s;al. I am &s;atisfy'd, &s;aid he, I &s;hou'd have no rea&s;on to complain of his Fate, were he de&s;tin'd to your Daughter: Therefore, if nothing oppo&s;es our Alliances, I ask her for
<PB N="5" REF="9">
him. Your Propo&s;al, my Lord, (reply'd Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co)</HI> is &s;o obliging, that I have room to believe you &s;incerely wi&s;h it. She is yet but Four Years old, and the Prince your Son but Eight; to what End can we di&s;po&s;e of the De&s;tiny of Per&s;ons, &s;o little advanc'd in Years? That ought not to be the lea&s;t Ob&s;tacle (&s;aid the Count) we can &s;ign the Contract of Marriage, and I will &s;end the Prince to you, that you may form him for <HI>Leonida.</HI> I don't que&s;tion but you will like him, he is a fine Youth, and his Sen&s;e exceeds his Years. You will be under no Difficulty (interrupted Madam <HI>Vela&s;co)</HI> to per&s;uade us into an Opinion of your Son's Merit; it is &s;uf|ficient that he is of your Illu&s;trious Blood. By what you are, my Lord, we judge what he may be; and I thank Heaven, that you have &s;uch favourable Di&s;po&s;itions for <HI>Leonida.</HI> From her Birth, I de&s;ign'd her for one of my Country, which is &s;till dear to me: and Don <HI>John</HI> &s;ets no le&s;s a Value on it than I. It is true (reply'd Don <HI>John)</HI> I have a great Ve|neration for the <HI>French,</HI> and am very &s;en&s;i|ble of their De&s;ert. Judge then, added he, with what Plea&s;ure we accept the Offer you make <HI>Leonida,</HI> which is as much above our Hopes, as her Merit. This Conver&s;ation ended with all the A&s;&s;urances of a perfect Friend&s;hip, and the Articles of Marriage were drawn. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> &s;ent his to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Don <HI>John</HI> carry'd his to the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and each con&s;ented to the Agreement,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
Don <HI>John</HI> made his Daughter's Fortune very con&s;iderable, and the whole Court was pleas'd with the Match.</P>
<P>Some time after, the Count of <HI>La March</HI> preparing for his Return into <HI>France,</HI> ask'd Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> and his Lady, whether they were willing he &s;hould &s;end his Son to them? No, my Lord, (&s;aid they) Let him remain in your Hands, as a Token of our Love and E&s;teem; the Education you will give him, will make him an accompli&s;h'd Prince; and we hope you will not part with him till he has taken a perfect Impre&s;&s;ion of your great Example. The Count promis'd he wou'd take all the Care imaginable to ren|der his Son worthy of being ally'd to them; then took his Leave.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> acquitted him&s;elf by the Count, of the many Acknowledgments he owed <HI>Charles</HI> the VIth. And writing to that Prince, told him, He cou'd not &s;ufficiently prai&s;e the Merit and Conduct of his Amba&s;&s;a|dor. The Count had not been long arriv'd at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> when News came of the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>'s Death by a Fall from his Hor&s;e, and his Son Don <HI>Henry</HI> &s;ent an Account of it by Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co.</HI> The Count of <HI>La March</HI> took that Opportunity to do him all the Honours of a Court, where he held a con&s;iderable Rank, being nearly related to the King. He pre&s;ented the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> to him, whom he found to be a finer Youth than he imagin'd; and from that Time, con|ceiv'd
<PB N="7" REF="11">
as great an Affection for him, as if he had actually been happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Leonida.</HI> The Peace and Tranquility which <HI>France</HI> then enjoy'd, was &s;oon after di&s;turb'd by an Accident that happen'd to the King; who being &s;truck with Terror and Surprize at an Apparation, fell into a Delirium, which continued for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>At this Juncture there was a very nice Ne|gotiation to be carried on in <HI>Spain;</HI> and the Dukes of <HI>Berry</HI> and <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Uncles to the King, having taken upon them the Admini|&s;tration of Affairs, look'd on the Count of <HI>La March</HI> as the mo&s;t capable Per&s;on to manage it. The &s;eeming Pretence of his Emba&s;&s;y was, the u&s;ual Compliments to the King and the Infanta his Brother on their Marriage; the one being lately marry'd to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and the other to the young Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Alburquerck,</HI> who was one of the rich|e&s;t Heire&s;s's in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Count of <HI>La March,</HI> at his Arrival in <HI>Spain,</HI> found Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> in great Favour at Court; the King having made him High-Steward of his Hou|&s;hold; and <HI>Leonida,</HI> tho' not above Nine Years of Age, was made one of the Maids of Ho|nour to the Queen, and bred up in the Palace.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> was extremely pleas'd to &s;ee the Count again; and her Satisfaction was &s;o much the greater, when he declar'd, he had never &s;een any thing comparable to the Beauty of her Daughter. He was &s;o &s;urpriz'd when he &s;aw her, that he cou'd not at fir&s;t expre&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="12">
his Admiration; her Hair was black and her Complexion as fair as po&s;&s;ible. It may be generally &s;aid of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies, that they have much finer Eyes than tho&s;e of other Countries. <HI>Leonida</HI>'s were &s;o full of Life and Spirit, that one cou'd hardly with&s;tand their Brightne&s;s; yet they retain'd all that Air of Sweetne&s;s and Mode&s;ty which becomes her Sex &s;o well. In &s;hort, the Beauties of her Mind were as perfect as the Charms of her Per&s;on; and the Count of <HI>La March</HI> was &s;o taken with her, that had not his Glory, and the King's Service call'd him back for <HI>France,</HI> he willingly, for her &s;ake, wou'd have &s;tay'd longer at that Court. Some time after his Re|turn, he was &s;ent again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> over whom he had the good Fortune of getting &s;o many Advantages as oblig'd them to wi&s;h for Peace, which &s;oon after was happily con|cluded, with Propo&s;als made by King <HI>Ri|chard,</HI> of a Marriage with <HI>I&s;abella</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> but the Count of <HI>La March</HI> had not the Satis|faction to be at the Conclu&s;ion of it, being forc'd by his Indi&s;po&s;ition to retire to <HI>Van|dome</HI> for &s;ome Relief; and finding there, that his Illne&s;s increas'd, he did not doubt but he was very near taking Leave of the World, therefore &s;ent for the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> and in a feeble Voice, thus &s;aid to him: The Con|dition I am in, my dear Son, wou'd give me great Concern, had I not procured a Father for you in Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co.</HI> I am per&s;uad|ed you will find no difference betwixt his
<PB N="9" REF="13">
Hou&s;e and mine, therefore perform the Pro|mi&s;e I have made for you; marry <HI>Leonida,</HI> it is your dying Father's Command. Tell your Brothers how dear they have been to me, and that I recommend them to the Care of Hea|ven. Do not render your &s;elves unworthy of your Name. Prefer Honour to Life, and never omit what you owe to God, or your King. I had rather &s;ee you dead, than &s;urvive a Di&s;|grace owing to ill Conduct. And as for you, my dear Child, it is a great Con&s;olation to me in dying, to believe your Inclinations will an&s;wer the Advice I now give you. The young Prince filled with Grief, fell at his Father's Feet, and in &s;pite of the Sobs, which prevented his Utterance, he endeavour'd to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf in Terms &s;o moving and gene|rous, that the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> after &s;o great a Satisfaction, had little Regret in dy|ing.</P>
<P>The Year following <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> King of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors into <HI>France,</HI> to de&s;ire <HI>Charles</HI> the Sixth to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with Troops, being re&s;olv'd to engage <HI>Bajazet.</HI> Tho&s;e Mi|ni&s;ters gave the King an Account, how that the Emperor <HI>John Palealogus</HI> had call'd that Enemy of the Chri&s;tians to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, a|gain&s;t the De&s;pote of <HI>Bulgaria;</HI> and that <HI>Ba|jazet</HI> making u&s;e of the Advantages he had obtain'd, wou'd not leave a Country where they had &s;o imprudently let him enter. The King concern'd at the Condition of <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> permitted mo&s;t of the Youth of <HI>France</HI> to
<PB N="10" REF="14">
make an Expedition in his Favour. The young Count of <HI>Nevers,</HI> who was then but Twenty Four Years old, put him&s;elf at the Head of the young Noblemen, who were very nume|rous; among others, <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI> Count of <HI>La March,</HI> highly di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf. The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> his Brother, made this Cam|paign with him; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s the Joy he receiv'd at having &s;o early an Opportunity of proving his Courage.</P>
<P>The Particulars of this Expedition I refer to the Hi&s;torian, and &s;hall only &s;ay, there ne|ver was a more unhappy Campaign. <HI>Bajazet</HI> having defeated the Chri&s;tian Troops, made a horrible Slaughter among&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and with much difficulty, con&s;ented to Ran&s;om Five or Six. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> and his Brother were dangerou&s;ly wounded, and made Pri&s;oners before <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was &s;o afflicted at the Di&s;a&s;ter of his Brother, that in his Confinement he nei|ther thought of the Danger of his own Wounds, nor his lo&s;t Liberty. When the Count of <HI>La March</HI> was recover'd, and able to take Care of his, and his Brother's For|tune, he heard with mortal Di&s;plea&s;ure the Re&s;olution <HI>Bajazet</HI> had taken, of putting all the Pri&s;oners to the Sword; and many were executed in that cruel manner: When the Count of <HI>Nevers</HI> pre&s;enting his Head to re|ceive the fatal Blow, an old <HI>Turk</HI> famous for his Predictions, cry'd out, (addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to <HI>Bajazet)</HI> Spare that young Prince, for
<PB N="11" REF="15">
he will de&s;troy more Chri&s;tians than all your Arms. The&s;e Words pre&s;erv'd the Life they were going to deprive him of, and the Event an&s;wer'd the Prophe&s;y. The Prince of <HI>Ca|rency</HI> appear'd in his Turn, and the deplora|ble State he was in at &s;o tender an Age, did no ways le&s;&s;en that noble Air, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes a Man of Birth and Courage from a common Per&s;on. He was &s;o perfectly hand|&s;om, that <HI>Bajazet</HI> him&s;elf was under &s;ome Sur|prize, and irre&s;olute, whether he &s;hou'd put him to Death, or be contented with his Ran|&s;om: But after &s;ome Su&s;pen&s;e, the happy De|&s;tiny of the Prince triumph'd over the natural Barbarity of the other; and Life was granted to him and his Brother, upon Condition, that a con&s;iderable Sum &s;hould be paid for their Ran&s;om: They writ to their Brother the Count of <HI>Vandome</HI> about it; but while they were expecting an An&s;wer from <HI>France,</HI> they heard that the Count of <HI>Nevers</HI> had paid his, and was preparing to return.</P>
<P>One Night the Prince (not having a mind to retire) as he was walking very di&s;con&s;olate on the Leads of the Tower where he was a Pri&s;oner, heard the Whi&s;tling of an Arrow, which fell at his Feet: He thought at fir&s;t, that &s;ome Per&s;on had a De&s;ign upon his Life; but &s;tooping to take it up, perceiv'd a Letter tied to it, which contain'd the&s;e Words, written in <HI>Lingua Franca.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="12" REF="16">
<P><HI>WHEN you appear'd before the Sultan loaded with Chains and in expectation of immediate Death, did you think you cou'd move any thing but Pity? You in&s;pired at that Time more than you can imagine, Love hid in your Eyes, from a Captive render'd you a Conqueror. Alas, I &s;aw you, my deare&s;t Prince, and from that fatal Mo|ment my Heart rebell'd again&s;t my Rea&s;on, and forced from me numberle&s;s Sighs. Methinks I &s;ee you; I imagine I &s;peak to you; and all my Thoughts are of you. I almo&s;t per&s;uade my &s;elf, that my Sentiments make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on you, and that our Souls already united, flatter us with a perfect Felicity. But alas! that wou'd be too great a Happine&s;s. I dare not hope nor even de&s;ire it, and &s;hou'd &s;ooner re&s;olve upon Death, than make the&s;e Sentiments known to you, were not I per&s;uaded you will never know who I am: And far from taking any Advantage of my Weakne&s;s, you will leave</HI> Nicopolis <HI>without &s;ee|ing me. Oh! how unfortunate am I, to find Con&s;olation in being di&s;tant from the Object I love! Con&s;ider this Extremity, and if you can|not love me becau&s;e Unknown, at lea&s;t do not refu&s;e me your Pity.

<P>The young Prince was not a little &s;urpriz'd at what he read. It &s;eem'd to him &s;o tender, that he felt an extream De&s;ire to &s;ee the Per|&s;on who expre&s;s'd &s;o extraordinary a Pa&s;&s;ion for him, and expected with the greate&s;t Impa|tience, the Time that he was to return an An|&s;wer.

<P><HI>YOU are the fir&s;t that ever made me &s;igh, and the Sacrifice I offer you, Madam, of the fir&s;t Motions of my Affection, ought to give me &s;ome Place in your Favour.

It was very late before the Prince retired, in hopes the fair Unknown wou'd have &s;ent him a &s;econd Letter the &s;ame way he receiv'd the Fir&s;t, but was di&s;appointed. He went again the next Day upon the Tower, where every Thing appear'd &s;o &s;ilent, that he had no room to flatter him&s;elf with what he &s;o much wi&s;hed. Is it po&s;&s;ible, (&s;aid he to his Brother, who was Pri&s;oner in the &s;ame Place with him, and to whom he had told this Adventure) Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Per&s;on who writ this Letter, &s;ought only to divert her &s;elf at my Expence? The oftner I read it, the more rea&s;on I have to believe it &s;incere; for I am per&s;uaded there is a Smypathy in Hearts, and therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;o touch'd with what is coun|terfeited.

The Prince return'd to his Chamber more melancholy than ever he had been; but he was no &s;ooner enter'd, when he &s;aw on a little Cedar Table, a Toilet richly embroider'd with the Cypher of his Name woven in Gold: The Work was perfectly fine, it cover'd a Scymiter embelli&s;h'd with Jewels and a little Casket with golden Plates, which he open'd with great precipitation, and found

a Letter in it, with a Sum that far exceeded his Ran&s;om. Here is what was wrote in the &s;ame Hand with the fir&s;t.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>GO young Prince, go far from a Place where my Pa&s;&s;ion may prove fatal to you. Expect no more Letters from me: This is the la&s;t you will receive. Oh Heavens!

<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> admired the Proceed|ings of this generous Lady, and his Gra|titude was of &s;uch a Nature, that the mo&s;t tran&s;cendent Pa&s;&s;ion cou'd not have made a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion; for when he con&s;ider'd he was to lo&s;e even the hopes of ever &s;eeing her, his violent Di&s;plea&s;ure took place of all the Joy he ought to have felt, at being in a Con|dition to pay his Ran&s;om, and return to <HI>France.</HI> He bid one of his Guards go and tell the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> that he wanted to &s;peak with him; but fir&s;t took care to hide the magnifi|cent Pre&s;ent he had ju&s;t receiv'd.</P>
<P>The Count came immediately to him, and &s;aw in his Eyes an extraordinary Air of Grief.
<PB N="16" REF="20">
At &s;oon as they were alone, the Prince flung his Arms about his Brother's Neck. I want your Con&s;olation, dear Brother, (&s;aid he) for I can receive it only from you. See! (conti|nued he, &s;howing him the Casket and Letter) &s;ee! what I owe to my Unknown, and the Nece&s;&s;ity &s;he impo&s;es on me to go away with|out &s;eeing her. Can any Thing be more great or noble? Or can there be any Thing more &s;oft or moving, than the Words &s;he imploys to bid me Adieu? Oh! how fatal will her Gene|ro&s;ity be to me, &s;ince I mu&s;t even lo&s;e the Hopes of knowing who &s;he is. Here he was &s;ilent, but after having meditated &s;ome Time: She loves me, &s;aid he, and I burn with a more than equal Pa&s;&s;ion for her. Why mu&s;t I then leave <HI>Nicopolis:</HI> In remaining here, I may di&s;|cover the Per&s;on to whom I am &s;o highly in|debted, and, if po&s;&s;ible, obtain the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing her: For Love certainly is too good a Guide to for&s;ake me in &s;o fair a way. The Count of <HI>La March,</HI> who loved his Brother entirely, was of Opinion that &s;o magnificent a Pre&s;ent could not come from any one but a Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Rank, and that if he expos'd him&s;elf by making an Enquiry after her, and penetrated into a My&s;tery that perhaps ought not to be di&s;clos'd, he might create him&s;elf Enemies, which would be of a very dangerous Con&s;equence in a Country where neither his Birth nor Merit could protect him, and where the Name of a Chri&s;tian was a Crime great enough to de&s;erve Puni&s;hment. Full of the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="21">
Thoughts, he conjured his Brother in the mo&s;t engaging Terms, not to per&s;i&s;t in a thing which lay under &s;o many difficulties; and repre&s;ented to him, that he might not only ruin him&s;elf, but al&s;o be the Occa&s;ion of undoing the Per&s;on whom he &s;o dearly loved. Cou'd you ever forgive your &s;elf, &s;aid he, &s;o Imprudent an Action? The Lady loves you, and were it po&s;&s;ible for her to &s;ee you without Danger, &s;he wou'd have found means to favour your Re|que&s;t. Therefore, dear Brother, let us go a|way with the Count of <HI>Nevers,</HI> and embrace the favourable Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>Bajazet</HI> is in at pre|&s;ent: His Capriciou&s;ne&s;s is ever to be fear'd, and &s;hou'd he change his Mind, what wou'd become of us?</P>
<P>Altho' the Count of <HI>La March</HI>'s Arguments were very weighty, the Prince was unwill|ing to &s;ubmit to them, having a &s;trong De&s;ire to find out by what means the Casket and Scy|miter were convey'd into his Chamber. He might ea&s;ily imagine, that one of his Guards had been bribed; but as it was hard to di&s;co|ver the Per&s;on (fearing he &s;hou'd apply to the wrong Man) he thought fit to be &s;ilent; &s;o took his leave of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> without knowing to whom he owed the highe&s;t Obligations.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI>'s Thoughts were con|&s;tantly imploy'd on his generous Unknown; and after his Arrival at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> he found a &s;ecret Con&s;olation in making her the Subject of his Di&s;cour&s;e, with the Counts of <HI>La March</HI> and <HI>Vandome,</HI> who equally ad|mired
<PB N="18" REF="22">
a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o di&s;crect, and a Genero&s;ity without hopes of any Return. Mo&s;t Women that are in Love and make Pre&s;ents, &s;aid they, have generally &s;ome View, that tends to their private Satisfaction: They endeavour to gain a Heart by Gratitude, when they cannot con|quer it by their Beauty. But this Illu&s;trious Foreigner, &s;aid the Prince, aim'd at nothing but procuring my Liberty, &s;ince &s;he even com|manded me to quit the only Place where I cou'd have &s;een her. He u&s;ed to talk &s;o often of her, that the Count of <HI>La March</HI> feared he had &s;ome de&s;ign of returning to <HI>Mi&s;ia,</HI> in order to di&s;cover who this Charmer was. This made him entreat the Prince to write an obliging Letter to <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> to put him in Mind of their Contract, and a&s;&s;ure him, that he only expected his Commands to go for <HI>Spain.</HI> The Prince having yielded to this Re|que&s;t: Con&s;ider well, &s;aid he to his Brother, the Violence I do my &s;elf. Shall I not be for ever unhappy in Marrying a Per&s;on for whom I have no Inclination? You know very well, that my Heart is fill'd with another Object. It is true, reply'd the Count, you love an un|known Per&s;on, who probably you will never &s;ee: You do not even know her Name, and perhaps &s;he is no longer at <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> Remem|ber, Brother, that <HI>Leonida</HI> mu&s;t crown your Felicity, &s;he is a great Fortune, and very Beau|tiful. How ea&s;y it is, interrupted the Prince to advi&s;e others, and imagine that a Heart ought always to &s;umbit to Rea&s;on: But
<PB N="19" REF="23">
alas! it too often rebels, and never &s;uffers greater Torments than when it is forc'd into an Engagement by the Choice of others. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> was doing all his Endea|vours to in&s;pire other Sentiments in his Brother, which he hoped time might effect.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> continued extream|ly melancholy till he receiv'd Letters from <HI>Don John;</HI> wherein he a&s;&s;ured him, that his Daughter &s;hould never be di&s;pos'd of to any one but him&s;elf; but that being very young, he de&s;ired the Marriage might be defer'd for &s;ome Years, and advis'd him to imploy that time in Travelling. This la&s;t Reque&s;t gave no &s;mall Satisfaction to the Prince; and as the Mare&s;chal of <HI>Boucicault</HI> was going then to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Genoa,</HI> which had &s;urrender'd volun|tarily to the King of <HI>France,</HI> he embrac'd that Opportunity, and went along with him to &s;ee that great City, which pa&s;&s;es for one of the fine&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI> As &s;o many have given a De|&s;cription of it, I &s;hall only pur&s;ue my Story.</P>
<P>The Mare&s;chal did not make a long &s;tay at <HI>Genoa,</HI> being commanded to go from thence to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with a fre&s;h Army, which became dreadful to <HI>Bajazet.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> acquainted the Mare&s;chal with the De&s;ign he had to accompany him in that Expe|dition; but the latter being inform'd by the Counts of <HI>La March</HI> and <HI>Vandome</HI> of the Pa&s;&s;ion he had for an unknown Lady at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and knowing that he was contracted to <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;poke to him in obliging Terms, and repre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="20" REF="24">
how much his Honour was concern'd in the Performance of his Promi&s;e to a Per&s;on of &s;o con&s;iderable a Rank; declaring at the &s;ame time, that if he in&s;i&s;ted on going with him he wou'd be forc'd to inform the Court of it. The&s;e Rea&s;ons oblig'd the Prince to remain at <HI>Genoa</HI> in the Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which had been offer'd to him in a mo&s;t civil manner.</P>
<P>One Night the Prince being more melancho|ly than u&s;ual, went alone to the Mole, which affords a fine Pro&s;pect, and continued his Walk along the Shore, till he in&s;en&s;ibly found him|&s;elf a great way from the City. How unhappy is my Fate, &s;aid he &s;ighing! I love and am be|lov'd, but know not the Object of my Pa&s;&s;ion: I can hear nothing concerning her Fortune, nor give her any account of mine; neither can I tell where to find the Lady, who&s;e Genero&s;ity has only &s;erv'd to de&s;troy my Peace. He was lo&s;t in the&s;e melancholy Thoughts, which were &s;ucceeded by others of a more tormenting Na|ture. Why, continued he, did my Father &s;a|crifice me to one whom I can never think a|greeable, &s;ince I adore another! yet &s;omething tells me it is a Crime to di&s;obey him. Oh, too Charming Unknown! cry'd he, were you but inform'd of the State I am in, you wou'd recal me to you; but what do I &s;ay? That is a Hap|pine&s;s I dare not hope, &s;he paid my Ran&s;om and commanded me to go; it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he now loves me no more or &s;trives to forget me, and in either of the two, I find but Subject to tor|ment me.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25">
The&s;e different Reflections were perplexing the Prince, when of a &s;udden Night came on, with Rain and terrible Thunder, which oblig'd him to direct his Cour&s;e along the Wall of a Park, where he found a Door that led him through a long Alley of Orange-Trees to a fine Pavilion; here he ob&s;erv'd a low Parlour, the Pannels of which were gilded, and the Roof finely painted. As the Weather was ex|ce&s;&s;ive hot, the Windows were open, and there being Lights in the Room, they gave him an Opportunity of &s;eeing one of the mo&s;t beauti|ful Per&s;ons in the World leaning on a Couch: She &s;eem'd a&s;leep, holding her Handkerchief in in her Hand, a mourning Veil cover'd half her Neck; and in this Po&s;ture &s;he in&s;pired both Love and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;tood &s;ome time at the Window, and perceiving that every thing was &s;ilent, went into the Parlour, and kneeled by her the better to con&s;ider her Charms; &s;he appear'd pale and dejected, and tho' a&s;leep, fetch'd deep Sighs, which were follow'd by Tears, that found a Pa&s;&s;age thro' her clos'd Eye-Lids. Who merits this Grief, &s;aid he, from &s;o lovely a Crea|ture? Is it a Husband or a Lover you deplore? He &s;top'd here, and reflected on Chance, that had conducted him to a Place &s;o dangerous to his Liberty. Then he continued; Who can de|&s;erve tho&s;e Sighs, and Tears? He looked with Admiration on the exact Proportion of her Fea|tures, the Whitene&s;s of her Hands and Arms, the Beauty of her Neck, and Colour of her Hair:
<PB N="22" REF="26">
His Eyes, fix'd on &s;o Divine an Object, had al|ready betray'd his Heart; and he had not well recover'd the fir&s;t Effects of his Surprize, when the Lady wak'd, who appear'd to be &s;eiz'd with Fear, which had like to have thrown her into a Swoon. He attributed this, to the Cu&s;tom ob&s;erv'd by the Ladies of <HI>Italy,</HI> never to &s;ee Men in their own Apartments, and thought &s;he might be marry'd to &s;ome jealous Husband, who finding a Man in his Hou&s;e &s;o late, might have &s;ome Su&s;picion, which wou'd prove of a fatal Con&s;equence to a Per&s;on for whom he had already conceiv'd &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion. I am extreamly concern'd, Madam, (&s;aid he) at the Di&s;order I have occa&s;ion'd, but will retire with Regret from a Place which gives me &s;o much Plea&s;ure. No, no, (reply'd &s;he) my Dear Lover, (flinging her Arms about his Neck) do not leave me; I love you too well to be frighten'd, tho' my A&s;toni&s;hment is great. Be Witne&s;s of the Tears I &s;hed for your Lo&s;s. Ah! dear Shade, why did that terrible Engage|ment part us? The Prince comprehended no|thing of this ob&s;cure Speech, yet thought him|&s;elf happy in the Care&s;&s;es he receiv'd; and as the Name of a Lover pleas'd him, that of a Shade &s;urpriz'd and afflicted him. The Sen&s;i|bility he had &s;hown on this Occa&s;ion might have convinc'd this fair Creature, that he was not one of the other World; but her Mind was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with his being dead, that &s;he &s;poke to him as to a Gho&s;t; which oblig'd him to &s;ay in a melancholy Accent; I find, Madam, you
<PB N="23" REF="27">
are deceiv'd in favour of &s;ome Re&s;emblance, and I prote&s;t, were I dead and deplor'd by you, I &s;hould think my &s;elf much happier than living and indifferent to you. Alas! I am not the Ob|ject of your Love. Who then, my Dear, reply'd &s;he with Precipitation? What Sorrow could be equal to mine, when I heard you were lo&s;t in returning from <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and that after having e&s;caped the Fury of <HI>Bajazet,</HI> it was your Mi&s;|fortune to peri&s;h by your Ship's being blown up in an Engagement? I own to you, as I cou'd not believe you &s;afe, after &s;o probable a Re|lation, I gave my &s;elf up entirely to Grief. Am I not very unhappy (&s;aid I) to have pro|cured him his Liberty by paying his Ran&s;om, &s;ince it has forwarded his End: But Oh Heavens! Can any Joy or Surprize be equal to mine? You are living, my deare&s;t Lover, and your Eyes tell me you live for me; read the Moti|ons of mine, they will convince you I live for you alone.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words were &s;o moving, that the Prince cou'd not doubt any longer but this Lady, who entertain'd him &s;o tenderly, was his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and this Opinion occa|&s;ion'd a Joy, which he cou'd neither conceal, nor expre&s;s, but thought he &s;hou'd die in Ec&s;ta&s;ie at his Mi&s;tri&s;s's Feet; he look'd upon it as a Miracle of Love and Fortune, that he &s;hou'd unexpectedly find &s;o &s;urprizing a Beauty, and he the Object of her Pa&s;&s;ion: He fix'd his Lips on her Hand, and ki&s;s'd it with &s;uch Tran&s;ports, as he had never felt before. Their
<PB N="24" REF="28">
Di&s;cour&s;e had no more Coherence, but their Sighs expre&s;s'd enough the State of their Souls. The Night was far advanc'd, when they were interrupted by one of the Lady's Women, who came to give her Notice that her Father was ju&s;t arriv'd. We mu&s;t part, my dear Lover, (&s;aid &s;he to the Prince,) return to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and in Two Days come here again, the &s;ame Way, and at the &s;ame Hour; I &s;hall expect you in this Place. Mu&s;t I leave you, Madam, (cry'd he with a dejected Air) no, I cannot re&s;olve it; Oh! rather con&s;ent I &s;hou'd remain here, no Danger can alarm me where you are pre&s;ent. What you ask, &s;aid &s;he, is impo&s;&s;ible Go my Lord, all I can do for you, is to give you my Picture, which I &s;at for with a De&s;ign to &s;end to you when you were in Confinement. Here it is, (continued &s;he, taking it from off her Arm, and tying it on his) Let nothing in the World make you neglect &s;o precious a Pledge of my Affection. He threw him&s;elf on his Knees, and wou'd have expre&s;s'd his Acknowledg|ments to her; but &s;he left him, fearing they &s;hou'd be &s;urpriz'd by her Father.</P>
<P>She was hardly gone, when the Prince a|bandon'd him&s;elf to all the Reflections that cou'd attend &s;o extraordinary an Adventure: Love, cry'd he, what have I done for thee to merit the&s;e Favours? Is thy Goodne&s;s la&s;t|ing, and may not I apprehend, that by &s;ome fatal Turn thou wilt de&s;troy a Pro&s;perity &s;o little expected? Day began to appear, when
<PB N="25" REF="29">
he perceiv'd he was &s;till in the Parlour; and fearing his &s;taying longer there might be of &s;ome Prejudice to his adored Mi&s;tre&s;s, he left the Place with Precipitation, and return'd to the Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI>'s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arriv'd he threw him&s;elf on his Bed, but cou'd not &s;leep, his Mind was &s;o much imploy'd on the Thoughts of his Charming Unknown; he had his Eyes conti|nually fix'd on her Picture, and fancy'd in her Ab&s;ence, he cou'd not have a Companion more dear. He ro&s;e very early, and the Senator hear|ing he was dre&s;s'd, came to wait on him, and wonder'd to &s;ee in his Countenance more Gaiety and Satisfaction than he had ever re|mark'd before. My Lord, &s;aid he, (with an obliging Air) tho' I have been in the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s about you, not knowing what Ac|cident might have detain'd you a whole Night alone, in a Country where you have &s;o few Acquaintance, I no longer doubt, but you have met with &s;ome agreeable Adventure; for I find you &s;o different from what you com|monly are, that I cannot help congratulating you on it. The Prince, tho' a little &s;urpriz'd at what the Senator &s;aid to him, (having na|turally &s;o much Di&s;cretion, as not to be capa|ble of di&s;clo&s;ing a Secret relating to Love) ex|cus'd him&s;elf as a Man of Gallantry wou'd do on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, and turn'd the Conver|&s;ation on another Subject, when there came one who interrupting them, told the Senator, that the Count of <HI>Fie&s;que</HI> was come to &s;ee
<PB N="26" REF="30">
him. He ro&s;e up, and &s;aid to the Prince, This Gentleman, my Lord, is of a Birth and Merit &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd, that nothing can be added to the Sentiments of E&s;teem and Con&s;ideration we all have for him: He has lo&s;t a Brother who was not inferior to him, and who re&s;embled you extreamly. In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, he went to his own Apartment to receive the Count of <HI>Fie&s;que.</HI></P>
<P>In a little Time after the Senator return'd with the Count, and pre&s;ented him to the Prince, who received him after &s;o polite a man|ner, that he could have no rea&s;on to be di&s;|pleas'd at his Vi&s;it; and during their Conver|&s;ation, he look'd at the Prince with &s;uch Marks of A&s;toni&s;hment, that he perceiv'd the Count had found in him the Re&s;emblance which the Senator had ju&s;t &s;poke of. You look at me &s;o attentively, my Lord, (&s;aid the Prince) that I &s;hou'd think my &s;elf happy, cou'd the Mo|tive that engages you to it acquire me your Friend&s;hip. That can be of no Service to a Per&s;on of your Di&s;tinction; (reply'd the Count with great Civility) it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee you, my Lord, and not have a particular E&s;teem for you; but I own that &s;o perfect a Likene&s;s af|fects me very much, and that if I were not well a&s;&s;ured of my Brother's Misfortune, I &s;hou'd have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to doubt it in &s;ee|ing you. They afterwards turn'd their Di&s;|cour&s;e on other Things, and parted with true Sentiments of E&s;teem for each other.</P>

The Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI> ap|proving his De&s;ign, propo&s;ed to wait on him to <HI>Brancaleon Doria</HI>'s, who for his eminent Qualities, was highly re&s;pected in the Repub|lick.

If &s;he be &s;o dangerous as you repre&s;ent her, I &s;hou'd avoid &s;eeing her, &s;aid the Prince; but I confe&s;s to you, continued he &s;miling, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of my Heart puts me out of her Power. I left a Mi&s;tre&s;s at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> who entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my Thoughts. I believe you, my Lord, (reply'd the Senator, &s;miling in his Turn) but am a little afraid you were not &s;o faithful la&s;t Night, as you &s;ay, in

the Remembrance of that amiable Stranger.</P>
<P>As the Prince's Appointment was at Night, he ha&s;ten'd to Signor <HI>Doria</HI>'s, that he might re|turn home time enough to obey the Commands of his Unknown: The Senator upon the Road told him, the young Lady's Name was <HI>Olym|pia,</HI> that &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with the late Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> and that the Hou&s;es of <HI>Fie&s;que</HI> and <HI>Doria</HI> had a mortal Aver&s;ion for each other, which hinder'd her Father from con&s;enting to their Marriage; that altho' they were reduc'd to De&s;pair, yet the Ob&s;tacles they met with, &s;erv'd only to increa&s;e their Affecti|on; and that the Count thought by ab&s;enting him&s;elf from <HI>Genoa</HI> for &s;ome Time, Signor <HI>Do|ria</HI>'s Hatred might dimini&s;h; but this Depar|ture prov'd fatal to him, for &s;oon after News came of his Death. <HI>Olympia,</HI> far from conceal|ing her Grief, yielded her &s;elf up entirely to it, which was fear'd &s;he cou'd not out-live. The Prince knowing by Experience, that of all Pa&s;&s;ions Love had the greate&s;t Empire, he ex|treamly deplor'd the Fate of this fair Lady. It is a great Unhappine&s;s indeed, &s;aid he, to be &s;eparated for ever from the Per&s;on we love: In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, they found them&s;elves near the Hou&s;e they were going to, &s;o that he cou'd not help interrupting him&s;elf, by prai&s;ing it; he had &s;ufficient Knowledge in Architecture to know a well fini&s;h'd Building, and in this he found Order, Magnificence, and a fine Situa|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33">
The Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI> introduc'd the Prince to Signor <HI>Doria,</HI> who gave him a Reception equal to his Rank; and during their Conver&s;a|tion &s;aid, he had never &s;een two Per&s;ons &s;o like each other, as the Prince and the Count of <HI>La Vagne.</HI> This gave the Senator an Opportunity of de&s;iring Signor <HI>Doria</HI> to pre&s;ent him to <HI>Olym|pia.</HI> I cou'd hardly di&s;pen&s;e with my not an|&s;wering your Reque&s;t, reply'd he, but that I am a&s;&s;ur'd, the Pre&s;ence of the Prince will re|new her Sorrow, and only &s;erve to in&s;pire us with Pity: He ask'd them to walk into a Gar|den joyning to his Apartment, from whence they &s;aw a va&s;t number of Fountains playing, who&s;e Waters &s;eem'd to pierce the Clouds, and made by their Fall a plea&s;ing Noi&s;e, that in|&s;pired agreeable Thoughts; from thence they went into a Labyrinth at the End of the Gar|den, and through a little Alley of Je&s;&s;amine, he led them into a Grotto, but was not a little &s;urpriz'd to find his Daughter there, who had retir'd to be more at Liberty to indulge tho&s;e Ideas that were mo&s;t plea&s;ing to her.</P>
<P>How a&s;toni&s;h'd was the Prince when he &s;aw <HI>Olympia,</HI> and knew her to be the &s;ame Lady he found a&s;leep in the Parlour, and for whom he had already conceiv'd &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion: And how great was her Surprize, when &s;he &s;aw her &s;uppo&s;ed Lover with her Father, who &s;eem'd to have no longer an Aver&s;ion for him. She look'd with &s;ome Di&s;order at the Prince, who&s;e Confu&s;ion increas'd at the Thoughts of what he had ju&s;t heard of the Count of <HI>La Vagne.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="34">
The Condition of their Souls was equally painted in their Eyes, and the Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI> began to penetrate into part of the My&s;tery, when <HI>Olympia</HI> (advancing towards her Father) flung her &s;elf at his Feet. Oh, Sir! &s;aid &s;he, Oh my Father! Is it po&s;&s;ible that you have at la&s;t pity'd our Sufferings, and that you your &s;elf re&s;tore me my Lover? At the&s;e Words the Prince cou'd no longer be unacquainted with his Misfortune; he turn'd pale, and trembling &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t a Pyramid of Pebbles; but his Affliction being &s;uperior to his Courage, he had like to have expired on the Place. Sig|nor <HI>Doria,</HI> who was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of nothing but <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Error, thought only of undeceiving her. My dear Daughter, &s;aid he, the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> whom you &s;ee here, is a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> who does not know you, nor did you ever &s;ee him before; you are de|ceiv'd by the Re&s;emblance there is between him and the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> I wi&s;h that too unfortunate Gentleman were not lo&s;t, I wou'd no longer oppo&s;e your mutual De&s;ires. The&s;e Words were Daggers to her Heart; &s;he turn'd her Eyes on the Prince, and fix'd them on him a great while without having Power to &s;peak, then changing her Colour fainted away, and remain'd without any Sen&s;e of Life. Signor <HI>Doria</HI> ran for help, whil&s;t the de&s;pairing Prince gathering new Strength from his Pa&s;&s;ion, took her in his Arms, and pre&s;&s;ing her tenderly, &s;aid in a low Voice, (interrupted with Sighs) Have not I given you my Heart, Madam?
<PB N="31" REF="35">
Cou'd the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> love you more than I? Who cannot think my&s;elf unde&s;erving of the Declaration you made me, &s;ince I adore you with too much Ardour ever to change; and I hope my Con&s;tancy will make &s;ome Im|pre&s;&s;ion on you. While the Prince was &s;peak|ing thus, without being heard by <HI>Olympia,</HI> Sig|nor <HI>Doria</HI> and the Senator brought &s;ome Water from a Fountain that was near, and having &s;prinkled a great deal on her, &s;he recover'd; but finding her &s;elf in the Prince's Arms; Ah! leave me, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he (looking at him with a langui&s;hing Air, and endeavouring to di&s;engage her &s;elf) you have deceiv'd me and interrupted my Grief, but Death &s;hall &s;oon repair an Error which was not voluntary. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the State the Prince was in, who found him&s;elf di&s;tractedly in love without any hopes of a Return; he heard his Mi&s;tre&s;s regret her Mi&s;take, and retract the Profe&s;&s;ions &s;he had made him; he &s;ecretly re|proach'd him&s;elf for having been incon&s;tant to his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> but cou'd not be enough &s;urpriz'd at the fatal Likene&s;s be|tween him and the Count of <HI>Vagne,</HI> and the Similitude of their Fortunes; they being in the Campaign of <HI>Mi&s;ia</HI> both taken Pri&s;oners by <HI>Bajazet,</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and ran&s;om'd by their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es: Every thing had &s;o &s;trange an Affinity, that the Prince had Rea&s;on to think him&s;elf the mo&s;t unhappy of all Man|kind.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="36">
<HI>Olympia</HI>'s Women being come, they took her from the Prince, who followed her into her Apartment; &s;he was laid on the Bed, which he approach'd; but as &s;oon as &s;he perceiv'd him, &s;he turn'd her Face from him and abandon'd her &s;elf to Grief. What have I done, Madam, &s;aid he, to de&s;erve your Di&s;dain? You have render'd your &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Heart, and prevented me declaring my Sentiments to you, by generou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ing yours in Terms &s;o obliging, that I was tran&s;ported; yet you now hate me, you even deny me a Look; and what ought to influence you in my Favour, in|curs your Di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>Olympia</HI> made no An|&s;wer, but with a feeble Hand pu&s;h'd him from her. Signor <HI>Doria</HI> cou'd not gue&s;s at the Mean|ing of this Di&s;cour&s;e, not knowing that the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had ever &s;een his Daughter. The Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI> &s;u&s;pected &s;omething of the Matter: But thought it very extraordina|ry, that &s;o Infant a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd already have the force of the greate&s;t Engagement.</P>
<P>The Illne&s;s of this divine Creature increas'd, and the Prince's De&s;pair was equal to it; It is impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent two Objects more worthy of Compa&s;&s;ion. Signor <HI>Doria,</HI> di&s;tracted at his Daughter's Condition, de&s;ired the Prince to re|tire, becau&s;e his Pre&s;ence augmented her Pain, and nothing le&s;s cou'd oblige the other to withdraw; but before he retired, he ap|proach'd her in Oppo&s;ition to what they cou'd &s;ay, and kneeling by her Bed: See, Madam, the Affliction I am in, (&s;aid he, with broken

Sighs) own at lea&s;t, that I de&s;erve your Pity, if you are cruel enough to deny me your E&s;teem: Oh! What have I done within the&s;e two Days to render me &s;o odious? I love you, Madam, to &s;uch a Degree, that I am too well a&s;&s;ured if you di&s;dain me, I cannot live; but what am I &s;aying? If the Life of a Man you no longer &s;eem to value, is a Sacrifice worthy of you, I &s;hall prefer it as a happy Fate. No, my Lord (&s;aid &s;he, endeavouring to an&s;wer him) I wou'd not have you participate of my Ruin, only wi&s;h that after the irreparable Lo&s;s I have receiv'd, Death may terminate my Mi&s;|fortunes; I cannot help confe&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t Concern to &s;ee your Condition. But as I am the Cau&s;e of it, continu'd &s;he, it is ju&s;t I alone &s;hou'd &s;uffer; live, my Lord, live I conjure you, forget my Weakne&s;s, and let me dye. In ending the&s;e Words, &s;he de&s;ired her Father, and the Senator to carry the Prince away; they told him, that as it was <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Reque&s;t, &s;he ought not to be di&s;obey'd. Overcome by the&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions, he left the Chamber, but &s;o di&s;or|der'd, that they were forc'd to &s;upport him. Signor <HI>Doria</HI> led them into a magnificent Apartment, and excus'd his being oblig'd to leave them, his Daughter's Illne&s;s requiring his Pre&s;ence: The Senator &s;tay'd with the Prince, who, after being &s;ilent &s;ome time, ask'd him if <HI>Olympia</HI> had been at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and whether it was there &s;he had paid the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI>'s Ran&s;om? He an&s;wer'd, &s;he had not been there, but that the Count, being taken Pri&s;oner by

<HI>Bajazet,</HI> writ immediatly to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and his Brother, de&s;iring the latter to &s;end him a Supply; that &s;ome Affairs of Importance hav|ing at that time oblig'd the Count of <HI>Fie&s;que</HI> to go to <HI>Rome, Olmypia</HI> fear'd his Ab&s;ence might detain her Lover the longer in his Con|finement, and for that Rea&s;on &s;old &s;ome of her Jewels, which &s;he cou'd di&s;po&s;e of unknown to her Father, and &s;ent the Value of them into <HI>Mi&s;ia</HI> for his Ran&s;om; that as he was coming back in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, it was attack'd by a Py|rate, and whil&s;t they were fighting, the Powder took Fire, and both Ships being blown up, all tho&s;e who were on board peri&s;h'd. This News was brought to <HI>Genoa</HI> with &s;o many Circum&s;tances, that there was no Room left to doubt it.</P>
<P>The Prince heard this Relation with a great deal of Concern, and after being a while with|out &s;peaking, he lifted up his Eyes to Hea|ven: I can hardly believe, &s;aid he, there is a Mortal on Earth &s;o wretched as I am. Give me leave to tell you, Sir, that I was but Eight Years of Age when my Father &s;ign'd a Con|tract of Marriage for me with <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI>'s Daughter, and on his Death-Bed, commanded me expre&s;sly to marry her; &s;ome Years after I was taken Pri&s;oner at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> where I was uncertain of Life, or Death, hav|ing Rea&s;on enough to fear the wor&s;t from <HI>Ba|jazet</HI>'s unequal Temper, who at la&s;t con&s;ented to receive my Ran&s;om, which I expected from <HI>France,</HI> when a Lady, who is yet unknown
<PB N="35" REF="39">
to me, made my Safety her care; &s;he wrote to me, and &s;ent me a Sum, which much exceeded my Ran&s;om; and I mu&s;t own, her Wit and Genero&s;ity in&s;pired me with &s;o perfect a Pa&s;&s;ion, that I believe, I cou'd not have lov'd her more, had I been acquainted with her. Being thus &s;et at Liberty, I came to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> where I made but a &s;mall Stay; my Mind was continually di&s;tracted with the Idea of my Un|known, which determin'd me to come here with the Mare&s;chal. Oh! certainly it was the Fatality of my Stars, that conducted me. You have been Witne&s;s &s;ince my Arrival of my exce&s;|&s;ive Melancholy; and as it was not in my Power to conceal it, rather than trouble my Friends, I endeavour'd to find out the mo&s;t un|frequented Places to be more at Liberty to in|dulge it. Here the Prince recited his Adven|ture with <HI>Olympia,</HI> but the Thoughts of &s;o cruel a Di&s;appointment oblig'd him to be &s;ilent &s;ome time; then recovering a little, he conti|nued his Di&s;cour&s;e: Oh! Sir, &s;aid he, think how great is my Misfortune; &s;he whom I adore at <HI>Genoa</HI> is not the &s;ame I lov'd in <HI>Mi&s;ia;</HI> this charming Lady, who flatter'd me with her Heart, is now dying for another; the Tragedy is before my Eyes; I have by my Pre&s;ence been an Addition to her Torment, and it is probable, &s;he is this Minute expiring, whil&s;t I am reflecting on the Cruelty of my Fate. He ro&s;e up, and was going out with Precipitation; but the Senator imagining he had a Mind to go to <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Apartment, &s;top'd him, repre|&s;enting,
<PB N="36" REF="40">
that &s;uch a Behaviour wou'd highly di&s;plea&s;e her, and that he ought rather, by his Ab&s;ence, to procure &s;ome Ea&s;e to her di&s;turbed Mind. The Prince was ob&s;tinate, but while they were di&s;puting, they heard the Cries of many Women, which gave the la&s;t Alarm to the Prince. Oh Heavens! the Work is done, &s;aid he (flinging him&s;elf upon a Couch) It is done! She is now no more; I have lo&s;t her for ever! His Tears wou'd not permit him to con|tinue his Complaint. The Senator &s;eeing the melancholy Condition he was in, extreamly pitied him, neglecting nothing, that he thought cou'd allay his Grief, which was too violent for any thing to mitigate.</P>
<P>Some of the Servants came and told them, <HI>Olympia</HI> had ju&s;t breath'd her la&s;t in her Father's Arms. It is hard to imagine the Agonies the Prince was in when he heard this di&s;mal News; and as he cou'd not doubt the Certainty of it, it flung him into the deepe&s;t De&s;pair. Oh! in what tender Language did he deplore her Lo&s;s? and with what Compa&s;&s;ion did he move tho&s;e, who &s;aw him in his de&s;olate State, which time it &s;elf cou'd hardly alter? He was going away without &s;eeing Signor <HI>Doria,</HI> which Proceeding might appear irregular, did not one enter into his Afflictions; for he look'd upon this un|happy Parent as the Cau&s;e of his Daughter's Death. The Senator <HI>Grimaldi</HI> repre&s;ented, that Civility oblig'd him to condole with Sig|nor <HI>Doria</HI> on the Lo&s;s he had ju&s;t receiv'd: Say rather (reply'd the Prince with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;i|on)
<PB N="37" REF="41">
that I ought to load him with Reproaches Barbarian as he was, to oppo&s;e <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Mar|riage with the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> which occa|&s;ion'd the Cruelty of his Fate, and has been the Source of my pre&s;ent Misfortune. But, my Lord, (&s;aid the Senator) do you reflect, that if &s;he had been happy in the Count, &s;he wou'd not not have met with this unfortunate Adventure. It is probable I might never have &s;een her, &s;aid the Prince, (interrupting him) or if I had, I &s;hou'd have known who &s;he was, and con&s;equently not have taken her for my Unknown; and my Gratitude for the one, wou'd have protected me from the Charms of the other; but alas! it is no more in my power: Let us go, &s;aid he, let us go, Sir, I have done my la&s;t: His Tears and Affliction oblig'd him to be &s;ilent, &s;o they return'd to <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince &s;poke but little on the Way, and what he &s;aid, only related to the Unhappine&s;s of his De&s;tiny. Oh! Night! Oh! fatal Night, cry'd he, what Plea&s;ures did you not promi&s;e me? This Minute I &s;hou'd have been with that divine Creature according to her own Appoint|ment: Alas I &s;hall &s;ee her no more! her beau|tuous Eyes are &s;hut for ever. The&s;e Cruel Reflections made him very thoughtful, and the Senator took that Opportunity to &s;peak to him: Cou'd you follow my Advice, my Lord (&s;aid he) you wou'd endeavour to conquer two Pa&s;|&s;ions which torment you at once; for you love a Lady at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> whom it is likely you may never &s;ee; <HI>Olympia</HI> you have &s;een, and
<PB N="38" REF="42">
lov'd her at fir&s;t Sight, &s;he is now no more: I mu&s;t own that all the Circum&s;tances of your Adventures are fatal; but if you call Rea&s;on to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it will tell you, that your Love is only due to <HI>Leonida;</HI> &s;he is de&s;tin'd for you, and I am inform'd, &s;he is a Perfection of Virtue, and Beauty: Why then, my Lord, &s;hou'd an Unknown, or a Per&s;on that is no more, deprive her of the Right &s;he has to your Heart? Why? reply'd the Prince; alas, is it in my Power to love whom I plea&s;e, and forget two Objects that &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s my Soul? Love, without con&s;ulting Duty, takes Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of our Inclinations; he promi&s;es a thou|&s;and Plea&s;ures, and will &s;ometimes grant &s;mall Favours: But oh! what Bitterne&s;s has been mix'd with tho&s;e he has hitherto be&s;tow'd on me? The Senator perceiv'd by the Warmth of his Di&s;cour&s;e, that his Advice, tho' very rea&s;on|able, was ill tim'd, therefore cho&s;e rather to pity the Prince, than condemn tho&s;e Sentiments which were too pa&s;&s;ionate and confus'd to be ea&s;ily conquer'd.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia</HI>'s Death was generally lamented at <HI>Genoa,</HI> being a Lady endow'd with many Ex|cellencies: The Count of <HI>Fie&s;que</HI> was extreamly touch'd at it. Nothing cou'd give more Lu&s;tre to my Brother's Merit (&s;aid he to his Friends) than the Sacrifice of this fine Creature, who de&s;pi&s;ing Fortune that per&s;ecuted them, wou'd not &s;urvive his Fate; no le&s;s than &s;o great an Example cou'd per&s;uade me, that a Pa&s;&s;ion does not expire with the lo&s;s of its Object.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43">
The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> (who &s;poke of her with great Concern) &s;oon made his Pa&s;&s;ion known to the World: his Affliction was &s;o deep that it appear'd in his Countenance, and tho' he was deny'd to all Company, yet he cou'd not refu&s;e &s;eeing Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez,</HI> who was a Nobleman of <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> lately ar|riv'd from <HI>Spain;</HI> and appear'd to be &s;o fine a Gentleman, that he ea&s;ily gain'd the Friend&s;hip and Confidence of all who were acquainted with him. He was at that Time di&s;tractedly in Love with <HI>Leonida,</HI> whom he had often &s;een by the Means of his Si&s;ter <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> who was al&s;o Maid of Honour to the Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o many agreeable Turns of Wit, that <HI>Leonida</HI> prefer'd her to the re&s;t of her Companions.

Match that is not yet &s;o far advanc'd, as to de&s;troy all my Hopes: But if in this happy Rival, I can &s;py no Fault, I &s;hall then apply to the only Remedy I have left; he mu&s;t die by my Hand, or I by his, and in either of the Two I &s;hall think my &s;elf much happier than in my pre&s;ent Condition. <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> who lov'd her Brother entirely, was &s;urpriz'd and griev'd at &s;o violent a Re&s;olution; You need not go to <HI>Genoa,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, with a De&s;ign to di&s;|cover any Imperfection in that Prince; I have &s;een tho&s;e who know him, and have no Inte|re&s;t in &s;peaking his Prai&s;e, yet agree they ne|ver &s;aw a more compleat Gentleman; be&s;ides, his high Birth greatly di&s;tingui&s;hes him, and Don <HI>John</HI> is a Man of too much Ambition, not to promote a Match &s;o glorious to his Family; therefore depend upon it, you will never pre|vail with him: I advi&s;e you to make your Pa&s;|&s;ion known to <HI>Leonida,</HI> before you venture on any other Attempt: The Affection &s;he has for me, may induce her to be favourable to you. Love is capricious, and there are no Mea&s;ures to be taken with it. Chance often decides the &s;tronge&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions, and if you can meet with that Sympathy which produces the Union of Hearts, you need no other Means to make you happy.

<P>Thus he &s;et out on his Journey, and being arriv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> went to vi&s;it the Prince. He could not have recommended him&s;elf better, than by &s;peaking <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Prai&s;e, and deplo|ring his Misfortune in her Lo&s;s; but one Day in Conver&s;ation, he &s;aid to him de&s;ignedly, You are not &s;o much to be pity'd, my Lord, as you imagine, &s;ince Donna <HI>Leonida</HI> is de&s;tin'd to be yours. I believe (continu'd he, endea|vouring to di&s;cover the Prince's Sentiments) you may find &s;uch Perfections in her, as will make you forget your other Di&s;appointments. The&s;e Words rather afflicted than con&s;ol'd the Prince. You &s;ee my Grief, reply'd he, and as you are my Friend, I mu&s;t own to you, the Engage|ment my Father has laid me under, gives me a mortal Di&s;plea&s;ure: Were my De&s;tiny in my own Power, I wou'd entirely lay a&s;ide all thoughts of Marriage; for at an Age that o|thers are hardly capable of receiving the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of Love, I have indur'd all its Tor|ments, without being ble&s;s'd with any of its Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Prince was &s;peaking, <HI>Benavidez</HI> had time to divert the confus'd Thoughts which tormented him; he extreamly rejoyc'd to hear the Prince declare the Indifferency he had for <HI>Leonida;</HI> but that Joy was often interrupted with tho&s;e Fears which generally attend great Pa&s;&s;ions. Here he re&s;um'd the Di&s;cour&s;e, and
<PB N="42" REF="46">
expre&s;s'd him&s;elf with &s;o unaffected an Air, that the Prince did not &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t De&s;ign. I participate with you, my Lord, (&s;aid he) in your Trouble, which is too well grounded. The mo&s;t agreeable Marriage, Time may render in|different. Con&s;tant Society di&s;covers many Failings, and it is very rare to find any Hap|pine&s;s in an Alliance contracted without Incli|nation; but the&s;e are not the only Rea&s;ons that induce me to pity you. Here he &s;top'd, and &s;eem'd in a &s;ort of Di&s;order, as a Man who had &s;aid more than he wou'd willingly have done: The Prince taking Notice of it, I pe|netrate your Thoughts, Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> &s;aid he, why &s;hou'd you conceal any Thing from one who has no Re&s;erve to you; pray tell me what you know of <HI>Leonida.</HI> I know nothing pre|judicial to her Honour, reply'd <HI>Benavidez;</HI> but I mu&s;t own, my Lord, I am &s;o particularly ac|quainted with her, that I fear you will be very unhappy if ever &s;he is yours; her Humour is incon&s;tant and &s;u&s;picious, the Haughtine&s;s of her Mind is in&s;upportable to all that know her; and, in &s;hort, &s;he is become &s;o ridiculous at Court, that &s;he wou'd meet with many Affronts, were it not for the Rank her Father holds there.</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! what do you tell me? (cry'd the too credulous Prince) is it po&s;&s;ible that all tho&s;e who &s;poke of her, have endeavour'd to deceive me in, &s;aying &s;he was the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd Creature they had ever &s;een. They only &s;aid it to &s;often your Grief, my Lord,
<PB N="43" REF="47">
(reply'd <HI>Benavidez</HI> with an indifferent Air) and I think my &s;elf very imprudent for having treated her with &s;o much freedom. You know me not, my dear <HI>Benavidez</HI> (&s;aid the Prince, taking him in his Arms) do you think me ca|pable of receiving ill &s;o generous a Confidence: No, I prote&s;t, I am extreamly oblig'd to you, and what grieves me mo&s;t is, that I cannot make the right u&s;e of it; my Fate is decreed and there is no declining it. What, my Lord! do you then intend to marry her? reply'd im|mediately <HI>Benavidez:</HI> Alas! what can I do, &s;aid the Prince? it was my Father's la&s;t Com|mand, and I will not de&s;erve the Reproach of having di&s;obey'd him. For my part, cry'd <HI>Be|navidez,</HI> I &s;hou'd for ever upbraid my &s;elf, if I &s;uffer'd you to proceed any farther in this Af|fair; as I profe&s;s my &s;elf one of your mo&s;t zealous Friends, I will &s;ooner give my Life than &s;ee you unhappy. You carry your Friend|&s;hip too far, generous <HI>Benavidez,</HI> (reply'd the Prince) it is not rea&s;onable that my Indifference for <HI>Leonida</HI> &s;hou'd make her Relations your E|nemies; therefore I am re&s;olv'd to offer my &s;elf a Victim to my Father's Will, without thinking any more of what I may have to fear in the Society of a Per&s;on &s;o di&s;agreeable. <HI>Be|navidez</HI> began to apprehend, that if he conti|nued to oppo&s;e the Prince in his De&s;ign, it might give him &s;ome Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion, &s;o took his Leave in the mo&s;t violent De&s;pair. How unfortunate am I? (cry'd he) what mu&s;t I re&s;olve on? I adore <HI>Leonida,</HI> and can never flat|ter
<PB N="44" REF="48">
my &s;elf with a Return, whil&s;t the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> who loves her not, is going to po&s;&s;e&s;s all her Charms. No, I cannot bear the Thoughts of it; I mu&s;t &s;acrifice this happy Rival before he &s;ees his Mi&s;tre&s;s, or lo&s;e my Life. He pronounced the&s;e Words with a me|nacing Air; and like a Man almo&s;t di&s;tracted, was tempted more than once, to return and &s;tab the Prince; but after having been &s;ome Time in this Di&s;order, his Spirits became more calm. What! &s;aid he, can I with Ju&s;tice hate him, &s;ince he is my Rival again&s;t his Will? Ought not I rather to open my Brea&s;t to him, implore his Pity, and conjure him to yield <HI>Leonida</HI> to me? No, this Expedient will never do, cry'd he again, I cannot repo&s;e this Con|fidence in him: What wou'd he think of me, &s;hou'd I confe&s;s a Pa&s;&s;ion for her, after having de&s;crib'd her as a Per&s;on unde&s;erving of him, and advi&s;ed him again&s;t her; he mu&s;t then be|lieve me the greate&s;t of Villains: But let him think what he will of my Sentiments, I had rather &s;ubmit to every Thing, than be depriv'd of the Object I love: I &s;hall tell him the Rea|&s;ons which induc'd me to &s;peak of her as I did: The Force of my Pa&s;&s;ion will excu&s;e me to a Per&s;on who is &s;o well acquainted with the Effects of Love, and has no other Motive to marry than Obedience. But alas! my Hap|pine&s;s is not in his Power: <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Father is the fir&s;t Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the King's Favourite; and &s;uppo&s;e all his Engagements with the Prince were in|tirely

broke off, he wou'd de&s;ign a Match for his Daughter much more con&s;iderable than I could pretend to be. The&s;e melancholy Reflec|tions &s;erv'd to per&s;uade him, that to &s;acrifice the Prince, or implore his Aid, wou'd be e|qually of no Effect, and that he ought to find other Means to procure him&s;elf the only Thing on which depended his Felicity.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI> &s;tay'd &s;ome Time at <HI>Genoa,</HI> and the Prince propo&s;ing to go on his Travels, in hopes that changing of Places might divert his Grief, ask'd him whether he was willing to go along with him? He accepted of the Offer, and the Senator <HI>Grimaldi,</HI> who was per&s;uaded that the Prince's Affliction was exceeding great, re&s;olv'd al&s;o to accompany him to <HI>Rome,</HI> being generou&s;ly inclin'd to partake of his Troubles, &s;ince he cou'd no ways remove them: He had a mighty Re&s;pect and Friend&s;hip for the Prince, who&s;e Merit and di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities made &s;o &s;trong an Impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who knew him, that they cou'd not help admiring him. <HI>Bena|videz</HI> had now laid a De&s;ign, whereby he ex|pected to break the Prince's Mea&s;ures; and in order to &s;ucceed he wrote to his Si&s;ter, that Chance had conducted him to <HI>Genoa,</HI> where the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was deploring the Death of <HI>Olympia Doria,</HI> with whom, at fir&s;t &s;ight, he had fallen pa&s;&s;ionately in Love. Upon this he gave an agreeable Turn to his Letter, which render'd it very diverting, but &s;o ridiculou&s;ly characteriz'd the Prince, that he wou'd have had all the rea&s;on imaginable to re&s;ent it, had he known any Thing of the Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50">
<HI>Benavidez</HI> de&s;ired his Si&s;ter, by a private Note, not to neglect &s;howing his Letter to <HI>Leonida,</HI> which &s;he as exactly perform'd as he cou'd have wi&s;h'd. One Day as they were both taking the Air, <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> told her, &s;he had receiv'd a Letter from her Brother, wherein her Name was often mention'd. He has been &s;ome Time ab&s;ent, &s;aid <HI>Leonida,</HI> does he not talk of returning &s;oon. He is at pre&s;ent im|ploy'd in your Service (reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> mali|ciou&s;ly) &s;ince he is con&s;oling a Prince for whom you ought to be concern'd; and if you will promi&s;e me to be &s;ecret, I can tell you &s;ome|thing in Confidence, that may be of U&s;e to you. I know you are always diverting your &s;elf with one Raillery or other, &s;aid <HI>Leonida,</HI> (who really thought it was nothing but a Je&s;t) neverthele&s;s I promi&s;e you to be &s;ecret, if that will do. Take this Letter then and read it, reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> you will &s;ee I am in earne&s;t, and that the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> in giving you his Heart, will pre&s;ent you with nothing new. <HI>Leo|nida</HI> read with &s;ome kind of Eagerne&s;s, what <HI>Benavidez</HI> had written to his Si&s;ter; then look|ing on her &s;miling, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, I am no ways alarm'd to hear of the Prince's Pa&s;&s;ion for a fine Woman, and am vain enough to flatter my &s;elf, that when he &s;ees me I &s;hall have it in my Power to deface the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;he might have made on his Heart; I am per|&s;uaded a dead Rival can prove no ways dange|rous; and provided I have no other to fear, I dare be a&s;&s;ur'd I &s;hall live in perfect Tranqui|lity.
<PB N="47" REF="51">
<HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> was extreamly confus'd to &s;ee in what manner <HI>Leonida</HI> had taken a thing, that &s;he imagin'd wou'd have vex'd her, but conceal'd her Di&s;order. You are in the right, my dear|e&s;t, Companion, (&s;aid &s;he, embracing her) to promi&s;e your &s;elf every Thing from your in|comparable Charms; they have Power enough to eclip&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t Ideas of any Love, but that which you in&s;pire. <HI>Leonida,</HI> who&s;e Mo|de&s;ty was parallel to her Beauty, wou'd hear no more of the&s;e Encomiums, &s;o interrupted her, de&s;iring &s;he wou'd chu&s;e &s;ome other Sub|ject for their Conver&s;ation. I wou'd willingly oblige you, reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> did I not think my &s;elf bound in Friend&s;hip to repre&s;ent to you the Advantages you have over the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> and how unfortunate you will be if you marry him: Reflect a little on what my Brother writes: Can any Thing be equal to the Weakne&s;s of a Man who falls di&s;tractedly in Love with a Per&s;on at fir&s;t &s;ight, knowing at the &s;ame Time he was de&s;tin'd to be Yours? It is ea&s;y to judge of his Character by &s;uch a Proceeding; indeed, (pur&s;u'd &s;he, &s;ighing) it grieves me, that you &s;hou'd be promis'd to One who &s;o little de&s;erves you. I am &s;en&s;i|ble of the Marks you give me of your Affection, my deare&s;t <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> (reply'd <HI>Leonida)</HI> and am not le&s;s touch'd at the Misfortune you have made me fore&s;ee; were I Mi&s;tre&s;s of my De|&s;tiny, I cou'd make a Choice different from that which is allotted me: I wi&s;h my Father wou'd con&s;ult my Sentiments on that Subject,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
and not &s;o entirely follow his own; but let what will happen, I am re&s;olv'd to obey him, and will not even endeavour to make him change his Re&s;olution: If I am unhappy in a Per&s;on I do not like, it &s;hall only affect my &s;elf, being determin'd never to give him any Rea&s;on to complain of my Conduct. <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> made no Objection to &s;o rea&s;onable a Di&s;po&s;ition, fear|ing <HI>Leonida</HI> &s;hou'd perceive &s;ome underhand De&s;ign, but thought &s;he had made a good Pro|gre&s;s for the fir&s;t Attempt, in di&s;covering from her own Mouth, that &s;he not only look'd on the Prince with Indifference, but had already conceiv'd an Aver&s;ion for him, which flatter'd her, that Time wou'd procure &s;ome other Op|portunity of practi&s;ing &s;uch Artifices as &s;he was capable of framing.</P>
<P>The Prince at this Time was at <HI>Rome,</HI> and being inform'd of the Emperor <HI>Vendi&s;la</HI>'s Jour|ney to <HI>Rheims,</HI> where the King of <HI>France</HI> was preparing to give him a Reception, believ'd, on this Occa&s;ion, the Court wou'd appear in its greate&s;t Lu&s;tre, and that it might be taken ill if he were not pre&s;ent; therefore propos'd that Tour to the Senator and Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> who readily con&s;ented to accompany him to the So|lemnity.</P>
<P>Upon his Arrival at <HI>Paris</HI> he order'd a fine Equipage to be made, and from thence went to <HI>Rheims:</HI> The pretext of the Emperor's co|ming there, was a Treaty of Marriage between the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s Daughter and the Mar|quis of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> tho' &s;ome a&s;crib'd it to
<PB N="49" REF="53">
other Motives. The young Princes and Lords who attended the Emperor and the King of <HI>France</HI> to this Meeting, left them to treat by them&s;elves, and pa&s;s'd their Time in Plea&s;ures agreeable to their Age; as Tournaments, run|ning at the Rings, and Balls, which daily &s;uc|ceeded each other with &s;o much Order and Magnificence, that all the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> endeavoured to be Spectators of this trium|phant Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> amid&s;t the&s;e Plea&s;ures, was extremely melancholy; his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> the Death of <HI>Olympia,</HI> and his Aver|&s;ion for <HI>Leonida,</HI> were equally a Torment to him, and <HI>Benavidez</HI> entertain'd him con&s;tantly in all the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Soon after the Emperor and the King of <HI>France,</HI> having agreed on what they came to treat of, took leave of each other; the latter being then inform'd that a Rebellion had broke out in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent over a Number of Troops under the Command of the Count of <HI>La March:</HI> The Count of <HI>Vandome</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency,</HI> who were de&s;irous of acquiring Glory, embrac'd that Occa&s;ion, and accompany'd their Brother in this Expedition. The Senator <HI>Gri|maldi</HI> took his Leave here of the Prince, and return'd to <HI>Genoa,</HI> but Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez</HI> went over with him for <HI>England,</HI> where they met with &s;o little Succe&s;s, that they were &s;oon forc'd back. At their arrival at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> perceiving that the Princes of the Blood, his near Relations,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
were in Conte&s;t relating to the Regency, thought he cou'd not well remain there with|out engaging in their Quarrel, &s;o re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>Rome;</HI> and having told his De&s;ign to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who was willing to go with him, took leave of the Court, and &s;et out on his Journey.</P>
<P>The mean while, <HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> were made Ladies of Honour, which allow'd them more Liberty than before; and as they waited on the Queen whenever &s;he went abroad, many People who had never &s;een <HI>Leonida,</HI> were &s;o charm'd with her, that &s;he &s;oon pa&s;s'd in <HI>Spain</HI> for a &s;urprizing Beauty. This Opinion did no ways intitle her to the Friend&s;hip of her Sex; for tho' the Ladies at Court cou'd not di&s;own her extraordinary Merit, yet it invited them all to envy her. <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> u&s;ed to talk very much to her in favour of her Brother, &s;aying Things at the &s;ame Time entirely to the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency</HI>'s Di&s;advantage: It is true, that what &s;he cou'd &s;ay in behalf of the one, made but a &s;light Impre&s;&s;ion on <HI>Leonida;</HI> but then the ill Character &s;he gave of the other, perplex'd her extremely: &s;he began to think her &s;elf very unhappy in the Choice her Father had made for her, of a Prince, who had no other Re|commendation but his Birth. I cannot imagine (&s;aid &s;he one Day to <HI>Ca&s;ilda)</HI> why the World will attribute &s;o many fine Qualities to a Man who is far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t of them, and how tho&s;e who have &s;een him, can &s;tudy to deceive me in his Favour. That is the Cha|racter
<PB N="51" REF="55">
of the Age, reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda;</HI> the Prince is con&s;ider'd as a Man of an eminent Rank and great Fortune; and &s;uch Per&s;ons as know he is contracted to you, will certainly &s;et him off to the greate&s;t Advantage: I am even &s;ur|priz'd at the Sincerity of my Brother, who I fear will have Cau&s;e to repent hereafter of what he has done: It is po&s;&s;ible you may one Day tell the Prince what he writ to me about him, and your Di&s;dain will be his only Reward for the Intention he had to &s;erve you. Ah! know me better, cry'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> and do not think me guilty of Ingratitude; I am too &s;en&s;ible of my Obligation to your Brother, ever to expo&s;e him to the Prince's Re&s;entment; and I declare to you, my dear <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> that after having con|&s;ulted my Inclinations, I am at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to make good u&s;e of his Advice: I will throw my &s;elf at my Father's Feet, and repre&s;ent to him my Aver&s;ion for the Prince in &s;o feel|ing a manner, that my Prayers and Tears &s;hall prevent his concluding our Marriage. <HI>Ca|&s;ilda</HI> was extreamly pleas'd at this Declaration, and encourag'd <HI>Leonida</HI> in that De&s;ign, not o|mitting to put her in mind of the Misfortunes which attend an Alliance made out of political Motives; and not to give her Time to change a Re&s;olution &s;o agreeable, &s;he conducted her to Don <HI>John</HI>'s Apartment, and there left her, in order to go and write to <HI>Benavidez:</HI> Her Letter was in the&s;e Terms;</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI> was arriv'd at <HI>Rome</HI> when he re|ceiv'd this Letter, which gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy: <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI>'s Affliction had not Power to in|terrupt the Plea&s;ure he had conceiv'd at the Thoughts of <HI>Leonida</HI>'s being di&s;pos'd to favour his Pa&s;&s;ion: He went to vi&s;it the Prince, who no &s;ooner &s;aw him but perceiv'd &s;o great an alteration in his Countenance, that he could not help inquiring into the Cau&s;e; <HI>Benavidez,</HI> &s;aid he, you mu&s;t have receiv'd &s;ome agree|ble News, for your Eyes &s;eem to own it. I will not keep any Thing a Secret from you, my Lord, (reply'd he) I come rather to make you my Confident. Speak then with an entire Con|fidence, &s;aid the Prince, you cannot do me a greater Plea&s;ure. I am in Love, continu'd <HI>Be|navidez,</HI> and have &s;ome Rea&s;on to flatter my &s;elf with an obliging Return. You mu&s;t know, that my Mi&s;tre&s;s having unju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected my
<PB N="53" REF="57">
Con&s;tancy, by the fal&s;e In&s;inuations of &s;ome of my Enemies, wou'd not &s;o much as hear me in my Ju&s;tification, but forbad me her Pre&s;ence; and the Care &s;he took to avoid me, had like, with my Life, to have ended my Misfortunes. I left the Court very di&s;con&s;olate and retired to my Country Seat, where I found, that So|litude only augmented my Grief; therefore to remedy this Ill, I re&s;olv'd to Travel, &s;o took leave of my Si&s;ter the mo&s;t di&s;tracted of all Mankind. She extremely pity'd my Condition, and promis'd, in my Ab&s;ence, to u&s;e her utmo&s;t Endeavours to make my Peace, which at la&s;t &s;he has done with the mo&s;t obliging Circum|&s;tances. My Mi&s;tre&s;s recals me, and now im|patiently de&s;ires my Return; but in &s;pite of my Pa&s;&s;ion, I am &s;en&s;ibly affected, my Lord, with being oblig'd to leave you; for I have felt &s;o real a Satisfaction in your Company, that I cou'd wi&s;h I had never known you, or that I were never to part from you.</P>
<P>The Prince, at the&s;e Words, embrac'd him with great Tenderne&s;s, which &s;hew'd, that his Departure touch'd him to the Heart: I was in hopes, &s;aid he, you wou'd have gone with me to the Court of <HI>Navarre,</HI> where my Brother is to marry the King's Daughter, and has de&s;ired me to attend the Ceremony. What Violence mu&s;t I do to my &s;ecret Pain, in a Place, where nothing but Plea&s;ure will be thought of? I cannot abandon my &s;elf to my Melancholy, neither do I believe I can be &s;o good a Coun|terfeit, as to conceal it from Per&s;ons &s;o di&s;cern|ing;
<PB N="54" REF="58">
and if I &s;peak of my torment to my Bro|ther, I fear he will not think it worth his Con|cern. Judge then, my dear <HI>Benavidez,</HI> what Con&s;olation your Company wou'd be to me, &s;ince you not only deplor'd my Fate, but &s;of|ten'd my Misfortunes, and in all Re&s;pects have appear'd the be&s;t of Friends: Oh, how nece&s;&s;ary wou'd your A&s;&s;i&s;tance be in this Junc|ture, and how extremely &s;hall I regret your Ab&s;ence! But the&s;e Con&s;iderations are too weak to oppo&s;e what your adorable Mi&s;tre&s;s commands, and your Inclinations invite you to obey. Go then (continu'd he &s;ighing) go and ta&s;te tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which are prepar'd for you. He fini&s;h'd the&s;e Words with &s;o de|jected an Air, that it wou'd have created Pity in any one but a Rival; for when once we adore an Object, we conceive an Aver&s;ion for tho&s;e who are Ob&s;tacles to our Happine&s;s, and have no longer Power to be ju&s;t, even to the Merit of any other Votary.</P>
<P>The Nuptials of the young Prince&s;s of <HI>Na|varre</HI> were celebrated with a Pomp and Mag|nificence equal to the Occa&s;ion; all manner of Diver&s;ions were given at the King's Expence, to make that Solemnity as fine as po&s;&s;ible; but in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Plea&s;ures, the Prince ap|pear'd lo&s;t in a Di&s;traction of Mind, which was too great for any thing to alleviate; however he affected a Gaiety which he was &s;o little us'd to, that the Counterfeit was ea&s;ily perceiv'd. What makes you &s;o very melancholy, Brother? (&s;aid the Count of <HI>La March</HI> to him one Day)
<PB N="55" REF="59">
I &s;ee the Violence you do your Inclinations when you are in the be&s;t of Company: It wou'd be better for you to break off with your Friends, and give your &s;elf up entirely to your own Humour. You make me an indifferent Return, interrupted the Prince, for the Care I have taken to conceal my <HI>Chagrin;</HI> but I pro|te&s;t to you, that it is of &s;uch a Nature as can|not be conquer'd; therefore, dear Brother, I will take your Advice, and in bani&s;hing my &s;elf from a Place where my Pre&s;ence is di&s;agree|able, avoid Reproaches, which very much af|fect me. The&s;e Words made the Count of <HI>La March</HI> &s;en&s;ible, that to rally him upon his Grief, was a certain Way to augment it; and as he lov'd the Prince dearly, and found many &s;hining Qualities in him, he embrac'd him with the greate&s;t Marks of Affection. What, dear Brother, (&s;aid he in an obliging manner) is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd take a Thing &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, which was only de&s;ign'd as a Je&s;t? Do you think, that for &s;o &s;light a Matter your Compa|ny cou'd be di&s;agreeable to me? No, do your &s;elf more Ju&s;tice, and never &s;u&s;pect mine. So unfortunate a Man as I am, reply'd the Prince, has ever room to fear, and if you knew what it is never to have &s;een one Mi&s;tre&s;s, and to lo&s;e another as &s;oon as you had conceiv'd a Pa&s;&s;ion for her, you wou'd not add to my Pain. The Count cou'd not help &s;miling at the Fan|ta&s;ticalne&s;s of the&s;e different Adventures. You do not pity me then, &s;aid the Prince, nor com|prehend how one can &s;uffer &s;o much with &s;o
<PB N="56" REF="60">
little rea&s;on; you think it ridiculous in me to &s;igh for a Per&s;on I do not know, and for one that is now no more; but Oh! the&s;e Two Things are the principal Cau&s;e of my Melan|choly. The Count of <HI>La March</HI> pity'd him ex|tremely, and omitted nothing afterwards that cou'd con&s;ole him.</P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Benavidez</HI> was arriv'd at <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> where he found a great Alteration, the King being dead, and the Care of his Son Don <HI>John</HI>'s Education (who was then but Twenty Two Months old) left to Don <HI>Diego Lopez</HI> of <HI>Cuniga,</HI> and Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co;</HI> which Mark of the King's E&s;teem for the&s;e two Lords, in repo&s;ing &s;o great a Tru&s;t in them, gave a migh|ty Addition to their Fortunes and Power. The Court was very much divided at that Juncture; the Infanta Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> Brother to the late King, having a con&s;iderable Party, was offer'd the Crown, but he generou&s;ly declin'd it, and had the young Prince proclaim'd King; which was perform'd to the great Satisfaction of the Queen, who (after her Son was &s;ettled on the Throne) retired to <HI>Villa Real</HI> for the Benefit of the Air, and agreeable Situation of the Place.</P>
<P>It was here that <HI>Leonora,</HI> Wife to Don <HI>Diego Lopez,</HI> introduc'd her &s;elf into the Queen's Fa|vour, and had &s;o great an Influence over her, that whatever &s;he ask'd, was immediately granted; &s;he had a great deal of Wit, but of &s;o dangerous a Nature, that tho&s;e who &s;incere|ly e&s;pous'd the Queen's Intere&s;t, began to lo&s;e their Credit by her malicious In&s;inuations,
<PB N="57" REF="61">
which made them in a little time conceive as great an Aver&s;ion for the Sovereign, as for the Favourite.</P>
<P>Thus was the State of Affairs when <HI>Benavi|dez</HI> came to <HI>Villa Real,</HI> where he &s;taid &s;ome Time before he cou'd find an Opportunity to &s;peak with his Si&s;ter; becau&s;e, during the fir&s;t Days of Mourning, it is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain,</HI> not to admit any Per&s;on into the Palace except the Family; but as &s;oon as the Queen cou'd be &s;een, he was introduc'd into her A|partment, where he found <HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the different Agita|tions he was in at the Sight of <HI>Leonida,</HI> who might have di&s;cover'd his &s;ecret Thoughts, had &s;he perceiv'd his Di&s;order.</P>
<P>After having &s;atisfy'd the Queen in &s;ome Particulars relating to his Travels, he ha&s;ten'd to his Si&s;ter's Apartment; but was agreeably &s;urpriz'd, when pa&s;&s;ing through a Gallery of Paintings, where <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> had de&s;ignedly invited <HI>Leonida</HI> to walk, he met them, and &s;aluted <HI>Leonida</HI> with much Re&s;pect. Give me leave, Madam, (&s;aid he) to acquit my &s;elf of the Commi&s;&s;ion I receiv'd from the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency,</HI> who charg'd me to a&s;&s;ure you, that he will be &s;oon here, in order to conclude a Mar|riage to which you are de&s;tin'd, tho' unknown to each other. It is an equal Misfortune to us both, (reply'd <HI>Leonida</HI> with a dejected Air) and the Particulars you writ to <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> relating to the Character of that Prince, have &s;o tormen|ted me, that I have omited nothing ever &s;ince,
<PB N="58" REF="62">
which I thought cou'd per&s;uade my Father to change his Re&s;olution; but he &s;o &s;trictly re|gards his Word, that hitherto my Prayers and Tears have had no Power to move him. <HI>Be|navidez</HI> fetch'd a deep Sigh, and after a Mo|ment's Silence; The Prince de&s;ired me, Madam, (&s;aid he) to &s;end your Picture to him, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s it wou'd be a Trouble to me to &s;ee him receive that Favour, had he not a Pro|&s;pect of being happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Original. I cannot di&s;po&s;e of my Picture, in|terrupted <HI>Leonida,</HI> without my Mother's leave, therefore it depends on you to ask it of her, but in my Opinion, it is entirely unnece&s;&s;ary: The Prince will &s;ee me too &s;oon for his Peace or mine. I am not amiable enough to efface the Objects which po&s;&s;e&s;s his Heart, but I will try, by my Obedience, to de&s;erve his E&s;teem. Madam! &s;aid <HI>Benavidez,</HI> &s;ince you con&s;ent to it, I will tell Madam <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> that it is the Prince your Lover's Reque&s;t. Speak to whom you plea&s;e of it, reply'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> with an Air of Contempt, but do not call &s;o fanta&s;tical a Per&s;on my Lover; I can never like a Man that falls in love with all he &s;ees, and even with tho&s;e he never &s;aw.</P>
<P>As &s;he had fini&s;h'd the&s;e Words, Madam <HI>Ve|la&s;co,</HI> who was going to the Queen's Apartment, enter'd the Gallery: She knew <HI>Benavidez</HI> had been a great while with the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> which made her &s;uppo&s;e there was an intimate Friend&s;hip between them; and as her Concern for a Prince who was contracted to her Daugh|ter
<PB N="59" REF="63">
cou'd not indifferently affect her, &s;he im|mediately enquired after his Health, and ex|pre&s;s'd a great Impatience to &s;ee him in <HI>Spain. Benavidez</HI> told her he had left <HI>Rome,</HI> and was going to the Court of <HI>Navarre,</HI> to be at the Solemnity of his Brother the Count of <HI>La March</HI>'s Nuptials, with the Prince&s;s <HI>Beatricia,</HI> Daughter to the King; that the Prince pa&s;&s;io|nately wi&s;h'd for <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Picture, which he had promis'd to ask for him, and therefore ad|dre&s;s'd her for that Favour. Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> was very much pleas'd at the Zeal <HI>Benavidez</HI> &s;eem'd to have for his Friend, and told him, She wou'd do any Thing that might be agree|able to the Prince; that her Daughter &s;hou'd &s;it for her Picture, and de&s;ired he wou'd take Care to &s;end it to him. <HI>Benavidez</HI> found that his Hopes as well as Pa&s;&s;ion augmented, and flat|ter'd him&s;elf that the Plot he was framing wou'd have its de&s;ired Effect; he left Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> and <HI>Leonida</HI> to go with his Si&s;ter into her Apartment, and after giving each other Proofs of an entire Affection; I have &s;ome|thing to &s;ay to you, Brother, &s;aid &s;he, come into my Clo&s;et: She took him by the Hand, and &s;itting down, cou'd not help &s;hedding a &s;hower of Tears. You weep, my dear <HI>Ca&s;il|da,</HI> (&s;aid he, embracing her) have you any Thing to &s;ay to me concerning Don <HI>Henriquez?</HI> Ah! Brother, (&s;aid &s;he) he is the ungrateful Object that troubles my Peace, and remembers no more the Obligations he owes me: I &s;hall find &s;ome Ea&s;e in relating to you all that has
<PB N="60" REF="64">
happen'd; and as a di&s;appointed Pa&s;&s;ion is le&s;s di&s;creet than a &s;ucce&s;sful one, I am going to inform you of what you know but very im|perfectly.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> was on Board the Fleet with the Admiral his Father, when one Day as the Queen was hunting, and we all at|tending her, Donna <HI>Blanca</HI>'s Hor&s;e &s;tarted, and not knowing how to manage him, ran away with her: Several Cavaliers rode after her, who were invited to &s;erve her, either by Inclination or Intere&s;t, &s;he being perfectly hand&s;ome, and Daughter to <HI>Leonora,</HI> who was then the Queen's Favourite. As I am natu|rally politick enough, I endeavour'd to reach her before the re&s;t, when I &s;aw her from the ri&s;ing Ground I was on, fall in a Valley; I rid as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, where I no &s;ooner came, but the fir&s;t Thing that &s;truck my Sight, was a Ca&s;e &s;et with Diamonds, which drop'd out of her Pocket when &s;he was thrown off her Hor&s;e; I took it up, and had no other Rea&s;on for not returning it in&s;tantly, but the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing what was in it. Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> was in a Swoon when the re&s;t of the Company came up; they immediately gave her what they thought wou'd re&s;tore her to her Sen&s;es, being &s;tun'd with the Fall; and as &s;oon as &s;he came to her &s;elf, &s;he perceiv'd &s;he had lo&s;t her Picture-Ca&s;e, which was &s;ought for, but in vain. I took notice of all her Motions, and her Unea&s;ine&s;s increas'd, with the fear of not finding what was &s;o dear to her: This gave
<PB N="61" REF="65">
me the greater Inclination to keep it, with the only View to mortify her, being one of the fine&s;t young Ladies of the Court, and Daugh|ter to the Favourite.</P>
<P>As &s;he had receiv'd no Hurt, &s;he went up to the Queen, but appear'd &s;o melancholy, that her Mother expre&s;s'd much Concern. I was impatient to be alone, that I might &s;ee what was contain'd in the Ca&s;e; but how can I tell you Brother, or at lea&s;t in telling you, ought I not to dye with Shame? I had but ju&s;t ca&s;t my Eyes on the Picture, which was inclos'd, when I found &s;uch Motions in my Heart as &s;urpriz'd me, being what I never felt before. I was charm'd with the noble Air and Youth of a Gentleman, who&s;e Features were &s;o admirably well drawn, that I cou'd no ways doubt but it very much re&s;embled the Per&s;on whom it was de&s;ign'd for; I gaz'd at it with Delight, and, tho' unknown to me, I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee any Thing more love|ly. I did not con&s;ider at fir&s;t, how dangerous my Curio&s;ity might prove, &s;o imploy'd &s;ome Hours in admiring this fatal Picture, who&s;e Idea it was not in my Power to deface: It threw me into &s;uch Reflections as generally &s;ucceed exce&s;&s;ive Tran&s;ports. Oh! unhappy <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> cry'd I, what &s;ubtil Poi&s;on hath &s;eiz'd thy Heart? Art thou &s;o tired with thy Liber|ty, that thou mu&s;t lo&s;e it this Day? I know not who this is that &s;eems &s;o Charming; I am well inform'd that he is in Love, and is belov'd, &s;ince Donna <HI>Blanca,</HI> who is &s;o beau|tiful,
<PB N="62" REF="66">
is the Guardian of his Picture, which &s;he &s;how'd by her Unea&s;ine&s;s to be very dear to her. What hopes then can I have of any Relief, and to whom mu&s;t I apply my &s;elf? Shou'd not my Birth and Mode&s;ty be &s;ufficient to impo&s;e Silence on me? What! cou'd I pronounce the Word I love, and pronounce it in Favour of a Man, who knows not the Va|lue of &s;o great a Sacrifice: No, my Eyes &s;hall &s;ooner be Witne&s;s of my Rival's Victory, and I will die before I expo&s;e my &s;elf to the Shame, which mu&s;t needs &s;ucceed &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion: But (&s;aid I a Minute after) is it po&s;&s;ible that in &s;uch a little Time, Love cou'd have made &s;o great a Progre&s;s? I am forc'd to lay a Command on my &s;elf, not to &s;peak of my Weakne&s;s, and I have form'd a Rival without having a Lover.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to you, Brother, this caus'd &s;o great a Change in me, that I began not to know my &s;elf: I was continually Thoughtful, and Solitude was the only Thing I courted: I fear'd to di&s;cover my Pain, or &s;eek for Means to know the Author of it. If I &s;how this Pi|cture, thought I, Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> will be inform'd I have it, and then I &s;hall be oblig'd to return it; &s;he is belov'd, and in &s;o great Favour, that I dare not declare my Sentiments, much le&s;s contend with &s;o dangerous a Rival.</P>
<P>Two Months were over before I cou'd hear any Thing relating to this Affair; I &s;ometimes enquired what young Lords were ab&s;ent; a|mong others, they named Don <HI>Garcia,</HI> Don <HI>Pedro</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="67">
<HI>d' Avilas,</HI> and Don <HI>Frederick Henriquez:</HI> How cou'd I know whether the Man that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my Thoughts, was either of them. I endea|vour'd to be acquainted with their Character; but tho&s;e, who were &s;o complai&s;ant as to de|&s;cribe them to me, in&s;tead of giving me &s;ome light in the Matter, left me more in the dark and in greater De&s;pair. I made it al&s;o my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cover, whether Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> had not a known Engagement, which I was per&s;uaded was the only Thing cou'd &s;atisfy me; but they told me, &s;he was too imperious to receive the Addre&s;&s;es of any of the Gran|dees. I knew the contrary, tho' I was not at liberty to declare it; &s;o that I langui&s;h'd be|tween &s;mall Hopes and cruel Fears. Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> was taken ill of the Small-Pox at this Time, and there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for her leav|ing the Court. I cannot help confe&s;&s;ing that I was extreamly pleas'd at my Rival's Misfor|tune. Heavens! cry'd I, ju&s;t Heaven! make her as ugly as po&s;&s;ible, that the Pa&s;&s;ion of her Lover may turn to a mortal Aver&s;ion. The Thoughts of this gave me &s;ome Ea&s;e, tho' I look'd upon my being in love with a Per&s;on I did not know, as the greate&s;t Unhappine&s;s that cou'd po&s;&s;ibly attend me. How wretched wou'd be my Fate, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, if this Picture with which I am &s;o charm'd, &s;hou'd only prove the Painter's Fancy, and that I &s;hou'd never &s;ee its Original. I reflected at la&s;t on which wou'd give me the mo&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, to &s;ee Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> ador'd by him I lov'd, or
<PB N="64" REF="68">
never to have hopes of &s;eeing the Object of my Pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e, in my Opinion, were two cruel Extremes; for I cou'd not determine my &s;elf on either, and therefore concluded I was the mo&s;t unfortunate Per&s;on in the World.</P>
<P>My Mind was in this Situation, when in the Queen's Apartment, thinking of the Odne&s;s of my Adventure, I went to the Window, from whence I &s;aw two Noblemen, follow'd by many Attendants; the younge&s;t of the Two &s;o perfectly re&s;embled the Picture, that I did not at all doubt but he was the Original, al|ready &s;o dear to me. In the fir&s;t Motions of my Surprize I fetch'd &s;uch a Shriek, and threw open the Sa&s;h with &s;o much precipitation, that every Body took Notice of it; and tho' the Queen did not &s;eem to mind it, the fir&s;t Lady of the Bed-Chamber did, and reprimanded me &s;everely. I recover'd the Di&s;order I was in, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and told her, I was deceiv'd by taking the young Lord for my Brother, whom I impatiently expected. The Affair pa&s;s'd in this manner, and I did all I cou'd to &s;uppre&s;s the Agitation, which might attend the fir&s;t Sight of a Cavalier, who&s;e Shadow had &s;o much di&s;turb'd my Peace.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the Reflections I had made, I was &s;eiz'd with &s;uch violent Emotions when the Admiral and his Son enter'd the Queen's Chamber, (for it was they) that I had like to have &s;wooned. Don <HI>Frederick Henriquez</HI> ap|pear'd &s;o thoughtful, that I was griev'd to the Soul. I ought not to flatter my &s;elf, &s;aid I,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
that Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> is indifferent to him; In his Looks I read my Misfortune: He &s;ympathizes with her in the Condition &s;he is in, and thinks none here worth his Notice. Oh Barbarian! (cry'd I to my &s;elf) you think of nothing but your Mi&s;tre&s;s; cannot you turn your Eyes on me, and &s;ee the deplorable State of wretched <HI>Ca&s;ilda?</HI> But, Brother, I am a&s;ham'd (&s;aid &s;he, interrupting her &s;elf) I am a&s;ham'd of unveiling my Weakne&s;s to you, and expo|&s;ing to your Cen&s;ure, Thoughts &s;o offen&s;ive to the Mode&s;ty of my Sex. I &s;hall only tell you, that the Queen came out of her Clo&s;et, and the Ladies made a Circle about her, when the Admiral gave her an Account of her Naval Force: I re&s;olv'd at that In&s;tant on a Thing that will appear to you no le&s;s bold than pre|cipitate, which was to write to Don <HI>Henri|quez;</HI> therefore without con&s;ulting Rea&s;on, or con&s;idering the Con&s;equence, I took out my <HI>Tablettes,</HI> and addre&s;s'd him in the&s;e Terms.</P>

<P>When I had fini&s;h'd my Letter, I was at a le&s;s how to convey it to Don <HI>Henriquez;</HI> at

la&s;t, I re&s;olv'd to tru&s;t the young Count of <HI>Oropez</HI> with it; his Po&s;t of being fir&s;t Querry to the Queen, gave him (as you know) an Opportunity of entertaining us often: He had a great deal of Wit, and having on &s;everal Oc|ca&s;ions ob&s;erv'd his Di&s;cretion, I made a Sign to him, and he came to me.

</LETTER>
<P>The&s;e Words &s;o agreeably flatter'd my Ima|gination, that I long'd for Night with the great|e&s;t Impatience; in the mean Time, I made a thou&s;and Reflections which gave me hopes, and entertain'd me till the appointed Hour. The Night was very dark, and hearing &s;ome Body approach the Window, I threw up the Sa&s;h, and ask'd in a low Voice; Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> is it you? Yes, Madam, (&s;aid he) it is the Man in the World who is mo&s;t indebted to you; but at the &s;ame Time I cannot help &s;aying, that the Advantage you have over me is too un|equal, &s;ince you know me, and I am not only unacquainted with you, but even a &s;tranger to what induces you to favour me with this In|terview. I will &s;atisfy you pre&s;ently (&s;aid I, in a trembling Voice) and that you may not &s;u&s;pect I &s;ent for you hither on a frivolous Sub|ject, know that I am <HI>Ca&s;ilda Benavidez;</HI> there|fore, my Lord, do not u&s;e any Di&s;&s;imulation, but tell me, upon Honour, whether you are &s;till in Love with Donna <HI>Blanca;</HI> if you will not be &s;incere in this Confe&s;&s;ion, I have no|thing farther to &s;ay to you. Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> &s;eem'd very much &s;urpriz'd at the Que&s;tion, and having paus'd a while, made me this An|&s;wer;
<PB N="68" REF="72">
Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> is &s;o charming, that her Chains are glorious; and &s;ince you believe I am her Captive, I will not &s;cruple to own it. The&s;e Words threw me into a very great Con|fu&s;ion. What! do you love that perfidious Creature, reply'd I, who has made a Sacrifice of you, and even di&s;pos'd of your Picture to convince your Rival how indifferent you are to her? With that I took a Light, which I had hid for fear of being di&s;cover'd, and obliging him to come nearer, I &s;hew'd him his Picture, and look'd at him &s;o tenderly, that he might have read my Thoughts. Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> after having view'd it, turn'd his Eyes on me, and I perceiv'd the Surprize was agreeable to him; but as what I had told him was very unexpect|ed, he ask'd me how I came to know that he lov'd Donna <HI>Blanca,</HI> and by what Misfortune he had forfeited her E&s;teem. I can ea&s;ily &s;a|tisfy you both the&s;e Que&s;tions, reply'd I; your Ab&s;ence having bani&s;h'd you from your Mi|&s;tre&s;s's Heart, Don <HI>Diego Cuniga</HI> made his Ad|dre&s;&s;es to her, and was favourably receiv'd: His Father, you know, is one of the fir&s;t Gran|dees, and &s;he being very ambitious, ea&s;ily con|ceiv'd a Pa&s;&s;ion for him, of which &s;he cou'd not have given a greater Proof, than &s;acrifi|cing your Picture to him. His Vanity was &s;a|tisfy'd, but his Love, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing by the A&s;&s;urance he had of a Return, made him &s;light her, and even di&s;continue &s;eeing her, which &s;he re&s;ented &s;o much, that it had like to have been the Cau&s;e of her Death: He endea|vour'd

to per&s;uade me, I was the Occa&s;ion of it; for that if he had not &s;een me, Donna <HI>Blan|ca</HI>'s Impre&s;&s;ion wou'd never have been effac'd: But as I had no Inclination to believe him, and did not give him &s;o obliging an Audience as he us'd to receive, to alter my Di&s;po&s;ition towards him, he brought me your Picture, told me e|very thing that pa&s;s'd when &s;he gave it to him, and beg'd I wou'd accept it as an Evincement that he never more wou'd renew his Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>Altho' I look'd on him as an unthinking young Gentleman, I took the Picture, and I prote&s;t to you my only Motive for &s;o doing, was to undecive you in relation to your un|grateful Mi&s;tre&s;s; for tho' I had no Acquain|tance with you, I frequently heard &s;o much in your Prai&s;e, that it gave me no &s;mall Concern to &s;ee you thus betray'd by a perfidious Wo|man, and therefore I re&s;olv'd to do all in my Power to di&s;&s;uade you from ever thinking of her more.

de&s;ire, that I may be the more able to lay my Heart at your Feet: I dare a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, that Con&s;tancy has ever been my Virtue, and I am &s;o well acquainted with Love, that you will find in me a Pa&s;&s;ion, if po&s;&s;ible, equal to your Beauty. It is too late (reply'd I &s;miling) to an&s;wer a Propo&s;al which you wou'd not have made me, had you le&s;s rea&s;on to be piqu'd; but as I am inclin'd to wi&s;h, that your Words were &s;incere, it will be a Plea&s;ure to me, when I find your Conduct engages me to determine in your Favour: In the mean Time, be very &s;ecret in regard to what is pa&s;t; your Compli|ance in this will be an ea&s;y way to e&s;tabli&s;h you in my E&s;teem.</P>
<P>I did not give Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> Time to make me an An&s;wer, but parted from him with &s;o much Satisfaction, that I wou'd not have chang'd my De&s;tiny for that of a Queen: My Mind was all that Night imploy'd on plea&s;ing Ideas. Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> is &s;ick and ab&s;ent, thought I, and will not appear at Court of a long Time; it is po&s;&s;ible her Sickne&s;s may deface her Charms, and a Mi&s;tre&s;s who is &s;u&s;pected to be incon|&s;tant, having lo&s;t that Attractive, will find it a hard matter to ju&s;tify her &s;elf: Be&s;ides, I have admirably well &s;ucceeded in my Stratagem: Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> is inclin'd to like me, and thinks he has Cau&s;e enough to break off with her. What have I then to fear? I &s;hall have made the Conque&s;t of his Heart before ever my Ri|val can be able to come and di&s;pute it with me.</P>

I appear'd the Day following at Court in a rich Dre&s;s, which every one admir'd, having a particular Intere&s;t in adorning my &s;elf to the be&s;t Advantage; and I di&s;pos'd every Thing &s;o well, that Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> came and a&s;&s;ured me, he had no rea&s;on to complain of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Proceedings, and that he was &s;o entirely pleas'd at the Di&s;covery I had made him, that it lay wholly in my Power to render him the mo&s;t con&s;tant of Lovers. This Declaration was at|tended with all the Court&s;hip that cou'd be ex|pected from a Man pa&s;&s;ionately in Love. How great was my Felicity in tho&s;e Days! I was ble&s;s'd with all, that Love and Gallantry cou'd in&s;pire. But, Oh Brother! I am ready to die when I call the&s;e Things to mind, and have nothing now remaining but mortal Grief. Are you entirely di&s;engag'd (&s;aid I &s;ometimes to him) and cou'd you re&s;i&s;t Donna <HI>Blanca,</HI> &s;hou'd &s;he endeavour to regain your Heart? You mu&s;t needs &s;u&s;pect my Sentiments, reply'd he, to que&s;tion what I wou'd do in &s;uch an Occa|&s;ion: I take Heaven to witne&s;s, charming <HI>Ca|&s;ilda,</HI> that were &s;he as con&s;tant as I cou'd have wi&s;h'd her, and more beautiful than ever &s;he appear'd to me, I &s;hou'd no longer confe&s;s her Power. Tho' his Prote&s;tations tran&s;ported me, yet I had room to apprehend, that when he &s;aw my Rival, a Di&s;covery might be made in which I &s;hou'd prove very unhappy. I &s;e|cretly reproach'd my &s;elf with my Perfidiou&s;|ne&s;s, and fear'd &s;ome Puni&s;hment wou'd attend it, which was &s;ufficient to make me unea&s;y; there|fore
<PB N="72" REF="76">
I pre&s;s'd Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> to &s;ollicite his Fa|ther's Con&s;ent to our Marriage, that they might afterwards join in their Reque&s;t to the Queen about it; which being once granted, I &s;hou'd have no longer rea&s;on to fear: He repre&s;ented to me the fanta&s;tical Humour of the Admiral, but promis'd he wou'd apply him&s;elf with the greate&s;t Care and Addre&s;s, in order to pre|vail with him. The&s;e A&s;&s;urances extremely flatter'd me, and I was expecting the Effects of them, when one Day the Queen went to take the Air in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Javalles,</HI> attended by her Ladies who were riding by her open Chai&s;e; but we were hardly got to the Height of a lit|tle Hill, when we di&s;cover'd in the Plain &s;ome Men on Hor&s;e-back which we knew to be <HI>Moors:</HI> They were engag'd with <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they charg'd &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that we thought them in the greate&s;t Danger: We &s;aw at the &s;ame time a Lady at the Foot of the Tree, appearing to us in a Swoon, with &s;everal Women about her, who, by their Actions, ex|pre&s;s'd much Concern.</P>
<P>The Queen &s;top'd at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;aw this Engagement with great Unea&s;ine&s;s; but Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> who had follow'd us, came up to her, and de&s;ired leave to go and &s;uccour the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> which her Maje&s;ty having a&s;&s;ented to, and commanded &s;ome of her Guards to at|tend him; he attack'd the <HI>Moors</HI> with &s;o much Bravery, that the Scene was chang'd in an in|&s;tant, and they being no longer able to oppo&s;e him, were oblig'd to fly for Safety. All this
<PB N="73" REF="77">
while my fearful Thoughts were imploy'd on the Dangers he was expos'd to; I was praying for his Succe&s;s, tho' already Conqueror; and as I ob&s;erv'd all his Actions with a watchful Eye, I &s;aw him approach the Ladies, who were &s;till frighten'd, tho' their Enemies were fled.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> had &s;carcely turn'd his Eyes towards them, when &s;purring his Hor&s;e, he rid full &s;peed from the Place; but perhaps he con|&s;ider'd, that &s;o great a Slight to the Lady (who was Donna <HI>Blanca)</HI> might di&s;plea&s;e the Queen, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he took Notice of it; therefore his Politicks, or rather my inevitable Misfortune, forcing him to return, he went up to her, and alighting, &s;aluted her very coldly; but what he &s;aid what &s;o &s;hort and confus'd, that in &s;pight of her Attention, &s;he cou'd not comprehend it. I owe you my Liberty (&s;aid &s;he) my Lord, for which I &s;hall think my &s;elf eternally oblig'd to you, tho' I am per&s;uaded you knew not in who&s;e Cau&s;e you fought. No, Madam, (an|&s;wer'd he) I was a Stranger to whom I ren|der'd this Service: I prote&s;t, that had I known how far you were concern'd, I &s;hou'd have had Occa&s;ion for all my Genero&s;ity to &s;upport me, in fighting for the mo&s;t perfidious Per&s;on in the World. And for my part (reply'd Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> with an Air of Pride) I retract my Obligation, &s;ince you confe&s;s your &s;elf unworthy of being my Deliverer. She &s;aid no more, becau&s;e one of her Women was near, (from whom I had this Relation) but call'd for her Chai&s;e, and
<PB N="74" REF="78">
went to meet the Queen. Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> left her, and came up fir&s;t to give her Maje&s;ty the Particulars of what had pa&s;s'd, and to let her know that it was Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> he had reliev'd, who had like to have been carry'd off by the <HI>Moors.</HI> At this Name I was Thunder-&s;truck, and my Imagination contriv'd a thou&s;and Ways to torment me, repre&s;enting all I had to fear from &s;o fatal a Rencounter. Can any Misfortune be equal to mine, &s;aid I? Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> taken by the <HI>Moors,</HI> was going by her Captivity to deliver me from all the Alarms her Return cou'd be capable of giving me: She is re&s;cu'd from this Danger, and owes her Safety to the Arm of Don <HI>Henriquez:</HI> I have now every thing to apprehend; he is ju&s;t come from her, and I doubt has di&s;cover'd my Treachery. I know not whether I deceive my &s;elf, but his Looks tell me he loves her &s;till. The Thoughts of her being incon&s;tant might have cured him, but nothing can do it, if he is once convinc'd of her Innocence: I &s;hall appear a Mon&s;ter to him, and become the Object of his Aver&s;ion. Heavens! what &s;hall I do, if what I dread &s;hould happen? Whether Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> would not talk to me for fear of being taken Notice of, or that he had no mind to it, I cannot tell, but he did not &s;peak to me all that Day. Don|na <HI>Blanca,</HI> who had not &s;een the Queen &s;ince her Recovery from the Small-Pox, took that Opportunity to ki&s;s her Hand. I was incon&s;o|lable to find her as hand&s;ome as ever, and her Prai&s;e the Subject of every one's Di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="75" REF="79">
whil&s;t I, as &s;ilent as Death, was ob&s;erving Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> who I thought did a Violence to his Inclination, in not approaching her. They appear'd both in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, yet their Eyes &s;eem'd to expre&s;s more Love than Anger. None but a Rival cou'd have known the Cau&s;e of the&s;e different Motions; but Oh! nothing e&s;cap'd my penetrating Jealou&s;y: I read in their Looks (as I imagin'd) my eternal Ruin.</P>
<P>The Queen was return'd to <HI>Villa Real,</HI> and I in her Apartment before I knew where I was, or even which way I came: I was lo&s;t in Me|lancholy, and thought it was very cruel in Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> not to &s;hew the lea&s;t Concern for me. What! (&s;aid I) is his Pa&s;&s;ion come to this? He who has render'd Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Service, and knows I apprehend nothing more than a Relap&s;e; does he thus neglect giving me A&s;&s;urances of the contrary? I pa&s;s'd all that Night in the greate&s;t Anxiety; and tho' I found my &s;elf indi&s;pos'd in the Morning, I ro&s;e early, and went to the Queen's Apartment, fearing &s;omething might happen there prejudicial to my Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> appear'd at Court that Day finely dre&s;s'd, and &s;o beautiful, that all but <HI>Leonida</HI> yielded to her. Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> was ju&s;t by me when my Rival enter'd the Cham|ber. Heavens! Madam, &s;aid he, how hand|&s;ome &s;he is! What Pity it is &s;he is fal&s;e. Why &s;hou'd her Fal&s;ity affect you, my Lord, (reply'd I) &s;ince at pre&s;ent &s;he ought to be indifferent to you. It is true, Madam, (an&s;wer'd he
<PB N="76" REF="80">
&s;ighing) but I only deplore the Misfortune of tho&s;e who wear her Chains. You are very charitable, &s;aid I, and the Publick is much in|debted to you. Here &s;uch a Crowd of various Thoughts pre&s;ented them&s;elves to me, that I was at a lo&s;s how to continue my Di&s;cour&s;e; and Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> without enquiring into the Cau&s;e of my Silence, had his Eyes fix'd on Donna <HI>Blanca.</HI> What's this! cry'd I? you ap|pear to me different from what you were Ye|&s;terday; Do you repent of having chang'd your Mind, and are you &s;till Slave enough to love that perfidious Creature? Don't you re|member that &s;he &s;acrific'd you to a Man of no Merit, which made me blu&s;h for her, as much as I do now for you? At this he interrupted me, and &s;aid, Indeed <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> you mu&s;t know me very little to frame &s;uch injurious Su&s;pi|cions: There is not a Man in the World who re&s;ents an ungenerous U&s;age more than I; and let me a&s;&s;ure you, that after I have loaded her with Reproaches, equal, if po&s;&s;ible, to the Of|fence, I will not only &s;how an Indifferency for her, but even de&s;pi&s;e her to &s;uch a degree, that you &s;hall have no rea&s;on to complain of my future Conduct.</P>
<P>He pronounc'd the&s;e la&s;t Words &s;o faintly, that I was confounded. What! &s;aid I, do you want to come to an <HI>Eclarici&s;&s;ement</HI> with Don|na <HI>Blanca;</HI> you cou'd do no more were &s;he a Pattern of Tenderne&s;s and Con&s;tancy? I &s;up|po&s;e, added I, you wou'd have no Value for &s;uch a Mi&s;tre&s;s. But give me leave to tell you,
<PB N="77" REF="81">
my Lord, that if you &s;peak to her, I will ne|ver &s;ee you more. He was &s;urpriz'd at the&s;e Words, and look'd at me a great while, en|deavouring to penetrate into the Cau&s;e of this Re&s;olution. He call'd to mind what Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> had &s;aid to him, which gave him Su&s;pi|cion enough to increa&s;e his Curio&s;ity; and tho' he promis'd to comply with my Com|mands, he did it with &s;o indifferent an Air, that I could no ways doubt of my Misfor|fortune.</P>
<P>I went from the Queen's Apartment into my own, and flung my &s;elf upon my Bed, half dead and drowned in Tears. Soon after <HI>Leoni|da</HI> came into my Chamber, who &s;aw my Con|cern and Di&s;traction, which wanted very little of De&s;pair, and &s;itting by me, did all &s;he cou'd to &s;often my Grief, without knowing the Cau&s;e of it: But to disburden my Mind of part of its Depre&s;&s;ion, I gave her an Account of what had pa&s;s'd: As &s;he had never been in Love, and con&s;equently unacquainted with what one in that State is capable of, &s;he cou'd not help condemning my Treachery to my Rival. Oh! <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;aid I, you little know the Effects of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; every Thing is allow'd to Lovers, when they are in pur&s;uit of a Heart: Say rather, reply'd &s;he, that we often allow to our &s;elves many Things which are very blame|able. If I have committed a Crime, &s;aid I, my Pu|ni&s;hment is near. Alas! I was not mi&s;taken: Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> had found an Opportunity to &s;peak to Donna <HI>Blanca;</HI> his Impre&s;&s;ion was not
<PB N="78" REF="82">
quite effac'd, whatever rea&s;on &s;he might have had to complain of his Behaviour. They ac|cu&s;ed each other, and by that means di&s;cover'd the Part I had acted. I leave you to think, Brother, whether they were not reconciled at my Expence. I was not long before I knew my Fate; for <HI>Henriquez</HI> came, and upbraided me with my Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. I wou'd have per&s;uad|ed him he was &s;till captivated by Donna <HI>Blan|ca,</HI> and that by her artful In&s;inuations, &s;he had prevail'd, and impos'd on him; but the ill O|pinion he had of me, prevented his believing it. As I knew his Temper, I thought I cou'd not do better than confe&s;s the Motive which had incited me to make him quarrel with his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Judge the Condition I was in, dear Brother, when I own'd that Love was the Oc|ca&s;ion of my Guilt, and expos'd my Weak|ne&s;s, which I was then &s;ure wou'd meet with a fatal Return. I &s;ought for Rea&s;ons to ex|cu&s;e my Crime, by painting my Pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t lively Colours, and my Tears convinc'd him of the Truth of what I &s;aid. He heard me without the lea&s;t Interruption, but at la&s;t look'd at me with attention, and a&s;&s;uming an imperious Air; I think my &s;elf &s;ufficiently re|veng'd of your Treachery, &s;aid he, &s;ince you love me, and I have no Thoughts of you but what are de&s;pi&s;ing; in fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, he left me. The Anger, Shame, and Grief which divided my Soul, had like to have immediate|ly ended my unhappy Life; but <HI>Leonida</HI> came to me at that Time and us'd her Endeavours to
<PB N="79" REF="83">
con&s;ole me, without the lea&s;t Succe&s;s. I was meditating the Ruin of Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> and <HI>Hen|riquez,</HI> and felt in my &s;elf &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition for a de&s;perate Undertaking, that nothing but the natural Sweetne&s;s of my Friend's. Temper cou'd moderate my Rage. My Rival, tho' victorious, wou'd not re&s;olve to pardon me; &s;he complain'd to her Mother, who was weak enough to enter into her Sentiments as a Con|fident, and ever &s;ince they have watch'd all Opportunities for Revenge. I have, by their means, forfeited the Queen's Favour, and meet every Day with &s;o many Subjects of Grief, as would deprive me of Life, cou'd any Thing be capable of it, but the Lo&s;s of the ungrate|ful <HI>Henriquez.</HI> I heard Ye&s;terday, that <HI>Leo|nora</HI> had prevail'd with the Queen to propo&s;e a Match to the Admiral between Donna <HI>Blanca</HI> and his Son, and that he had given his Con|&s;ent to it: I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee her triumph: judge then&mdash;Here <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> cou'd no longer re&s;train her Sighs and Tears, which oblig'd her to be &s;ilent. <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who was extremely touch'd with her Affliction, told her, he wou'd fight Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> and neglected nothing which he thought cou'd le&s;&s;en her Pain; but as that which affects the Heart is very different from any other, &s;o it requires more Time for its Cure. We &s;hall find notwith&s;tanding, in the Sequel of <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI>'s Story (de&s;pairing as &s;he was) that many Years were not expired before &s;he found Con&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84">
<HI>Benavidez</HI> gave his Si&s;ter an Account of what had pa&s;s'd between him and the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency,</HI> and told her, he mu&s;t needs have <HI>Leo|nida</HI>'s Picture, for he had thought of an Expe|dient to make her have a great Aver&s;ion for her Lover; but that he wou'd not declare his Pa&s;&s;ion to her, till he was a&s;&s;ured &s;he had &s;ome Confidence in him; for which rea&s;on he beg'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> to &s;ollicite his Intere&s;t, who promis'd to act for him to the utmo&s;t of her Power: Accordingly &s;he de&s;ired Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> to let her Daughter &s;it for her Picture, which, in Op|po&s;ition to the young Lady, was immediately granted, and given to <HI>Benavidez;</HI> who caus'd another to be drawn, but with &s;o aukward an Air, that none could &s;ee it without having a di&s;dain for the Original. This was the Picture he &s;ent by an Expre&s;s to the Prince, with a Letter at the &s;ame Time, telling him, that that Piece wou'd &s;how how charming the Per&s;on was whom Fate had decreed him, &s;ince it was her perfect Likene&s;s; and that he had enter|tain'd her with his Merit, but &s;he hardly wou'd have Patience to hear any thing on that Subject; which convinc'd him, her Thoughts were imploy'd on &s;ome other Object.</P>
<P>The Prince, who gave too much Credit to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> was &s;truck with &s;uch Confu&s;ion at the &s;ight of this Picture and Letter, that he immediately wrote to him, and without any Caution, confe&s;s'd the Cruelty of &s;o unhappy an Alliance, and his Aver&s;ion for <HI>Leonida.</HI> But as &s;he had &s;ome rea&s;on to be per&s;uaded that
<PB N="81" REF="85">
her Picture wou'd produce a contrary Effect; &s;he often ask'd <HI>Benavidez,</HI> out of a Motive of Self-love, whether he had heard from him, and what was his Opinion of her; therefore, as &s;oon as he had receiv'd the Prince's An&s;wer, (which was writ in &s;uch Terms as overjoy'd him, being that nothing more di&s;obliging cou'd be added) he contriv'd, that <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> &s;hou'd &s;how it <HI>Leonida</HI> with &s;uch an Air of Secrecy, as if he were no ways con&s;enting to it. The thing was carry'd on as he had de&s;ign'd it. <HI>Leonida</HI> read the Prince's Letter, at which &s;he was &s;o offend|ed, that &s;he immediately went and threw her &s;elf at her Mother's Feet, and conjured her with Tears to break off a Marriage, which wou'd render her the mo&s;t unfortunate Crea|ture in the World. I will not pretend, Madam, to di&s;obey you in any thing, &s;aid &s;he, but is it po&s;&s;ible that you your &s;elf wou'd occa&s;ion my Ruin? Tho' I have but little Experience in the Sentiments one ought to have for a Hu&s;|band; yet it appears to me, that without mu|tual Love nothing but continual Torment can be expected; for how can I value the Man you have cho&s;en for me, &s;ince he has not only con|ceiv'd an Aver&s;ion for me, but thinks me ugly and de&s;pi&s;es me? Cannot you change my Fate, Madam? Oh! rather let me never mar|ry, or if you are not pleas'd I &s;hou'd live with you, &s;end me to a Mona&s;try; I will &s;ooner embrace that State of Life, than be united to a Prince for whom I have no Inclination. Ma|dam <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> mov'd at her Daughter's Com|plaint,

took her &s;everal Times in her Arms, and endeavour'd to con&s;ole her in a mo&s;t tender manner. If it wholly depended on me, my deare&s;t Child, (&s;aid &s;he) I wou'd &s;oon ea&s;e your Mind; but your Father is my Lord, and we are both &s;o far bound in Duty to comply with his Plea&s;ure, that I cannot promi&s;e you any thing till I know what are his Intentions. As &s;he had ended the&s;e Words, Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> enter'd the Chamber; the Mother and Daughter flung them&s;elves at his Feet, and with Prayers and Tears, conjured him to break off with the Prince: They &s;how'd him the Letter he had written to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> but all wou'd not do; Don <HI>John</HI> was determin'd to keep his Word with him, even at the Expence of his Daughter's Happine&s;s. He an&s;wer'd them, that the Contract was &s;igned, and nothing &s;hould ever make him revoke a thing he had concluded with the late Count of <HI>La March;</HI> &s;o <HI>Leonida</HI> withdrew in the greate&s;t Affliction, and having inform'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> of her Father's Sentiments, told her, &s;he was re&s;olv'd to retire into a Mona&s;try.

I cou'd make you a greater Sacrifice (reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> &s;ighing) you know the rea&s;ons I have to hate this fatal Place: The fal&s;e <HI>Henriquez</HI> will &s;oon be marry'd to Donna <HI>Blanca;</HI> I &s;hall have nothing before my Eyes but what will increa&s;e my De&s;pair; and in &s;pite of my Pride and Rea&s;on, I cannot cea&s;e loving that cruel Man, tho' he glories in my Weakne&s;s. Ab&s;ence is the only thing that can efface his Idea; let us go, charming <HI>Leonida,</HI> (continued &s;he) let us fly the Man I love, and him you hate. My Fate is more deplorable than yours, reply'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> your Ab&s;ence will procure you &s;ome Ea&s;e, and no Body will pur&s;ue you; but as for my part, I &s;hall be pur&s;ued, and perhaps di&s;|cover'd, and brought back to my Father's Hou&s;e, where I &s;hall meet with very &s;evere U&s;age. Ah! how little do you know the &s;ad Condition I am reduc'd to, cry'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> do you think it a Con&s;olation to tell me, that no Body will pur&s;ue me? That is the chief Cau&s;e of my Grievance: I cou'd wi&s;h the perfidious <HI>Henriquez</HI> wou'd abandon all, and follow me; Heavens! how tran&s;ported &s;hou'd I be! If you propo&s;e to enjoy a perfect Tranquillity, reply'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> do not harbour any Wi&s;hes &s;o contra|ry to your Peace. Alas I know not what to wi&s;h (&s;aid <HI>Ca&s;ilda,)</HI> then let us go; Solitude

and Ab&s;ence may chance to give &s;ome Ea&s;e to my Mind. Young <HI>Leonida,</HI> who had but lit|tle Experience, and did not fore&s;ee the fatal Con&s;equences of &s;uch an Undertaking, con|&s;ented to the dangerous Propo&s;als of her Com|panion: She embrac'd her a thou&s;and Times, and confe&s;s'd in a mo&s;t tender manner, her Ob|ligation for the con&s;iderable Service &s;he was going to render her. They afterwards agreed on a Day and Hour to execute their Project, and imploy'd all their Thoughts in taking &s;uch Mea&s;ures as cou'd make it &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>This was the State of Affairs when they were inform'd, that the Count of <HI>La March</HI> was arriv'd at <HI>Seville</HI> with a magnificent Atten|dance, and a Body of Eight Hundred Men to &s;uccour the Infanta Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> who was then at War with the <HI>Moors.</HI> The Virtue and eminent Qualities of this illu&s;trious Prince were &s;oon publi&s;h'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency,</HI> his Brother, had no &s;mall Share in the general Applau&s;e: He had accompany'd the Count to <HI>Seville,</HI> from whence he intended to go to <HI>Villa Real,</HI> in order to marry <HI>Leonida:</HI> but Fortune was preparing long Torments for him, in&s;tead of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures he wou'd have ta&s;ted, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Lady &s;o charming and virtuous.</P>
<P>The Prince wrote a Letter to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> to acquaint him with his departure from <HI>Seville,</HI> which he immediately communicated to <HI>Leoni|da.</HI> She now thought it Time to be gone, and without farther Con&s;ideration, tru&s;ted her
<PB N="85" REF="89">
&s;elf (with <HI>Ca&s;ilda)</HI> to the Conduct of <HI>Benavi|dez,</HI> who over joy'd and full of Hopes, omit|ted nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary in this Affair. They left <HI>Villa Real,</HI> and he accompany'd them &s;ome part of the Way; but fearing his Ab&s;ence from the Court at the Time of their di&s;appear|ing, might give &s;ome Su&s;picion of his having a hand in it, he de&s;ired <HI>Leonida</HI> and his Si&s;ter to accept of one of his Friends, who &s;hou'd wait on them to their Journey's End, being a Man who&s;e Fidelity was &s;o well known to him, that he ran no Ri&s;que in tru&s;ting him with his Mi&s;tre&s;s and Si&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI> expre&s;s'd much Concern in part|ing from <HI>Leonida,</HI> who might have ea&s;ily per|ceiv'd it, had not her Thoughts been imploy'd otherways. He took his leave of them, and they continued their Journey with all the Dili|gence and Secrecy po&s;&s;ible. When they were arriv'd at <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where no Body knew them, they chang'd their Names; <HI>Leo|nida</HI> call'd her &s;elf <HI>Felicia,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> took the Name of <HI>Beatricia,</HI> &s;aying they were Si&s;ters, and of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Leon.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman who had accompany'd them, return'd to <HI>Villa Real,</HI> and gave an Account to <HI>Benavidez</HI> of their &s;ucce&s;sful Journey, whil&s;t the young Ladies were taking the innocent Pa&s;time of an agreeable Solitude.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Impatience he had to &s;ee <HI>Leonida,</HI> appear'd at Court with a counterfeit Air of Gaiety. But Heavens! in what Affliction were Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> and
<PB N="86" REF="90">
his Lady, when they perceiv'd their Daughter was gone: They believ'd at fir&s;t, that &s;he and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> were retired to a Mona&s;try, and <HI>Bena|videz</HI> &s;eem'd to believe the &s;ame, &s;aying, That that was the only rea&s;on, which prevented him from &s;earching all <HI>Spain,</HI> in order to find his Si&s;ter. Don <HI>John,</HI> who had greater Cau&s;e for Unea&s;ine&s;s, imploy'd all Means to di&s;cover the Place where <HI>Leonida</HI> might be; but his Enquiry being to no purpo&s;e, he was almo&s;t in De&s;pair: <HI>Benavidez</HI> the mean while was propo&s;ing to him&s;elf no &s;lender Share of Happine&s;s in the Succe&s;s of an Enterprize he had manag'd &s;o artfully; but the Queen being then inform'd that &s;ome Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who were di&s;&s;a|tisfy'd with the Government, were carrying on a traiterous De&s;ign, and had re&s;olv'd to deli|ver up &s;ome con&s;iderable Towns to the King of <HI>Granada,</HI> &s;he order'd, that <HI>Benavidez</HI> (who was Governour of one of tho&s;e Places, and had been impeach'd, tho Innocent,) &s;hould be taken up. This unexpected Blow, threw him into a de&s;perate Condition; he fear'd, it had been di&s;cover'd that <HI>Leonida</HI> was at his Hou&s;e, and that he was arre&s;ted on that Account; but when they told him that it was for High Trea|&s;on, he thought him&s;elf too happy, and &s;eem'd le&s;s mov'd for the Lo&s;s of his Life, than the lo&s;ing of <HI>Leonida;</HI> however, his being prevent|ed from going to &s;ee her, increas'd his Grief to &s;uch a Degree, that he cou'd not conceal it from his Guards, which made them conclude him guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="91">
The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> arriv'd at this time at <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> and did not know what to think of the many Reports he heard. The flight of <HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda, Benavidez</HI>'s Impri&s;onment, and the di&s;tracted Condition of <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> and his Lady, as well as his Concern for a Per&s;on to whom he was contracted, and the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under of u&s;ing his utmo&s;t En|deavours to find her, together with his Indif|ferency for her; all the&s;e united, perfectly con|founded him. He made an ineffectual Attempt to &s;peak to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who was &s;o &s;trictly guard|ed, that he judg'd the Affair he was accus'd of wou'd meet with no Favour, if once convict|ed, unle&s;s the Queen's Goodne&s;s wou'd prevail with her Ju&s;tice. He heard that <HI>Leonora</HI> was her Favourite, and having a &s;trong Inclination to be &s;erviceable to his Friend, he made his Court to this old Lady, who, tho' as proud as great, cou'd not but conceive a particular E&s;teem for the Prince. <HI>Don John</HI> and his Lady were &s;o charm'd with him, that their Satisfac|tion wou'd have been compleated, had not his Pre&s;ence renew'd all the Grief which the Lo&s;s of <HI>Leonida</HI> occa&s;ion'd; &s;o that nothing cou'd moderate the Affliction of the&s;e di&s;con&s;olate Parents.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was pre&s;ented to the Queen, who received him with a Re&s;pect equal to his Birth and Merit. Donna <HI>Leonora</HI> u&s;ed to &s;peak &s;o often to her of his fine Qualities, that &s;he &s;oon perceiv'd her Favourite look'd on him with an obliging Eye, and that he triumph'd
<PB N="88" REF="92">
in her E&s;teem over the other Princes and Gran|dees of the Court. He con&s;train'd him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible to oblige her, being invited by no other Motive than to &s;erve <HI>Benavidez.</HI> Oh! had he known, that he was working for the greate&s;t of his Enemies, and one who was endeavouring his Ruin, he wou'd have left him to his evil Genius.</P>
<P>One Day as the Queen was walking in the Palace-Gardens, attended by mo&s;t of the Court, Donna <HI>Leonora</HI> affected to keep at &s;ome di|&s;tance, which the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> perceiv|ing, he went and &s;aluted her; &s;he receiv'd him very graciou&s;ly, and ask'd him if he wou'd go with her into a green Arbour that was not far: After he had return'd her Compliment, he led her to the Place, where being &s;et down, &s;he &s;poke to him in this manner. Do you take this Opportunity I give you, my Lord, of en|tertaining me, as a Favour I &s;eldom grant to any? Your Youth, Wit and Quality are &s;uffi|cient Motives to make you admired; but as I have no Inducements to create a Pa&s;&s;ion, be &s;o kind as to tell me, from whence proceeds the de&s;ire you have of conver&s;ing with me. Is it the Effect of a Sympathy, that is frequently found between two Hearts, and for which no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd? The Prince was very much &s;urpriz'd at what he heard, but &s;till had a mind to obtain her Favour on the Account of <HI>Benavidez,</HI> without intending to make any Declaration that might di&s;tingui&s;h a Lover from a Friend. He look'd at her &s;ome time as
<PB N="89" REF="93">
one a&s;toni&s;h'd, which entirely confounded <HI>Leo|nora.</HI> You ought, Madam, (&s;aid he) to be convinc'd, that you have highly oblig'd me in conde&s;cending to this Interview; which is an Honour I have this long time wi&s;h'd for; but if you will give me leave to improve this Oc|ca&s;ion, let it be in behalf of the unfortunate <HI>Benavidez:</HI> I know the Queen has &s;o ju&s;t an Opinion of your good Sen&s;e, that &s;he will readily a&s;&s;ent to any thing you are pleas'd to promote: Grant him your Protection, it is the greate&s;t Favour I can ask. Your Petition is not very great (reply'd <HI>Leonora,</HI> in an angry Tone) when you imploy for another the Op|portunity you ought to embrace for your &s;elf: Is it po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, that you can think of your Friend's Intere&s;t, and neglect your own? Oh! I &s;ee too well, that I am deceiv'd: there can be no Pa&s;&s;ion where there appears &s;o much In|differency. This embara&s;s'd the Prince more than ever any Thing had done, yet he try'd to conquer him&s;elf, and taking her by the Hand; You know very little, Madam, (&s;aid he) the Language of my Eyes, when you form &s;o ill a Judgment of my Sentiments, as to doubt of my Pa&s;&s;ion: Your Charms are the only Subject of my Contemplation, and the Fear of offending you was the Cau&s;e of my Silence. This obliging Confidence, my Lord! reply'd &s;he, equally flatters my Vanity and Love; for I cou'd not think my &s;elf &s;o happy in your Favour: I am infinitely plea&s;|ed at the Confe&s;&s;ion you have made me,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
and &s;ince you wou'd have me &s;erve <HI>Benavi|dez,</HI> I promi&s;e you to do it effectually; whe|ther he be innocent or guilty, he &s;hall be &s;et at Liberty. The Prince made his Retributions to her in &s;o grateful a manner, that &s;he was perfectly charm'd with him: but as he was tired with this di&s;agreeable Conver&s;ation, he impatiently ro&s;e up and took his Leave.</P>
<P>When he was alone, he abandon'd him&s;elf to tho&s;e Reflections which were mo&s;t painful to him. Heaven, ju&s;t Heaven! cry'd he, what am I re&s;erv'd for? I find my &s;elf intangled in an Amour with the uglie&s;t of Women, and who is the only one that ever gave me a fa|vourable Audience. Oh! I love my Unknown at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Memory is &s;till dear to me. <HI>Leonida,</HI> prevented by &s;ome Fatality, has cho&s;en rather to fly her Father's Hou&s;e, than yield to his Commands. Now mu&s;t I, to &s;erve my Friend, counterfeit a Pa&s;&s;ion for this Favourite, who is an Object fitter to in|&s;pire Aver&s;ion, than a more obliging Senti|ment.</P>
<P>Tho' he reproach'd the Cruelty of his Fate, yet he did not omit paying his Devoirs every Day to <HI>Leonora,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion ro&s;e to that Violence at la&s;t, that &s;he determin'd to marry him, which was the thing in the World he lea&s;t thought of. She &s;ent to him, and de&s;ired he wou'd come to her; which having obey'd; my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, if in the Profe&s;&s;ion you have made me there is more Truth than Complai|&s;ance, and that you are touch'd as much as
<PB N="91" REF="95">
you wou'd per&s;uade me, you cannot give me a greater Proof of it, than by uniting your De|&s;tiny with mine. I will not trouble you with a Detail of my Birth and Fortune, all <HI>Spain</HI> can inform you of both; but &s;hall content my &s;elf with a&s;&s;uring you that you will find in me &s;o good a Friend in becoming your Wife&mdash;My Wife! have you &s;uch a thought (cry'd the Prince, interrupting her.) Here he was &s;ilent, but perceiving his Mi&s;take, he endeavour'd to recover it, and a&s;&s;uming a tender Air; &s;uch an Alliance, Madam, &s;aid he, wou'd infinitely plea&s;e me, if I were not engag'd to <HI>Leonida,</HI> and you know it is not in my Power to retract my Promi&s;e. No, cruel as you are: I know no|thing; (interrupted <HI>Leonora,</HI> in a furious man|ner) I &s;aw your Surprize and Horror at a Pro|po&s;al you are not worthy of; you have not only deceived me, but have al&s;o deceiv'd your &s;elf. Know, Sir, that in this Kingdom, you mu&s;t not dare to offend a Per&s;on of my Quali|ty unpuni&s;h'd, e&s;pecially one who has as much Power as the Queen: <HI>Benavidez</HI> &s;hall be my fir&s;t Victim, and take care (perfidious as you are) that you be not the Second. In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, &s;he gave him a menacing Look, went into her Clo&s;et, and &s;hut the Door with great Violence, leaving the a&s;toni&s;h'd Prince in her Chamber.</P>
<P>He immediately went to Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI>'s, and without any Re&s;erve, acquainted her with all that had pa&s;s'd. You may be well a&s;&s;ured, Madam, &s;aid he, that were I not even con|tracted
<PB N="92" REF="96">
to <HI>Leonida,</HI> I wou'd &s;ooner chu&s;e to dye than marry a Woman, who by her Cruelties, is become odious to all <HI>Spain.</HI> I know her Birth and Fortune are equally great, but I de&s;pi&s;e them both; therefore give me your Advice, Madam, and tell me, what Mea&s;ures I mu&s;t take to deliver my &s;elf from this Mon&s;ter, without expo&s;ing the Life of <HI>Benavidez.</HI> That is a harder Task than you imagine, (reply'd Madam <HI>Vela&s;co)</HI> the violent Temper of this Woman has already &s;acrific'd many, and I tremble for you: The Queen loves her to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he will blindly conde&s;cend to all her De&s;ires. Alas, my Lord, why are you in <HI>Spain?</HI> Or why are you not the Husband of <HI>Leonida?</HI> With this &s;he bur&s;t out into a Flood of Tears. You weep, Madam, &s;aid he, and I have rea&s;on to believe you are concern'd for me. Do you think this Affair will have any other Con&s;equence, than my being oblig'd to quit <HI>Villa Real?</HI> I am no Subject of <HI>Spain,</HI> neither is a Man of my Rank to be in&s;ulted without Revenge; and I am a&s;&s;ured, that if <HI>Leonora</HI> &s;ees me no more, &s;he will &s;oon forget me. Then prepare to depart, my dear Son, (reply'd Madam <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> embracing him ten|derly) I will take my Daughter with me into <HI>France</HI> if &s;he is living, and nothing &s;hall alter the Re&s;olution I have taken to make her eter|nally yours.</P>
<P>Tho' nothing cou'd be more obliging than the A&s;&s;urances Madam <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> gave the Prince, yet he did not extremely wi&s;h for the Perfor|mance:
<PB N="93" REF="97">
He was in hopes, that either <HI>Leonida</HI> wou'd not be found, or that her Aver&s;ion for him wou'd continue; in which Ca&s;e, the Mar|riage of Cour&s;e mu&s;t needs break off, and he wou'd be no longer under the Obligation of executing his Father's Commands. He imme|diately took leave of Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> being re&s;olv'd to go away the &s;ame Night, in order to join the Count of <HI>La March</HI> (his Brother) who was waiting at <HI>Seville</HI> for the Infanta Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> to march again&s;t the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>He retired early to his Apartment, and gave Orders, that all things &s;hou'd be ready for his Journey; but <HI>Leonora</HI> (who had Spies over the Prince's Actions) was &s;oon acquainted with his &s;udden Re&s;olution; and &s;eeing &s;he had no Means left to prevail with him, ran and threw her &s;elf at the Queen's Feet, conjuring her with Tears in her Eyes, to take pity of her Weak|ne&s;s. The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> is parting, Ma|dam, &s;aid &s;he; he abandons me, and I &s;hall be the wretchede&s;t Creature in the World, with|out your Maje&s;ty is pleas'd to protect me. The hopes of being his Wife, (flatter'd by his A&s;&s;iduity and faithle&s;s Prote&s;tations) made &s;o deep an Impre&s;&s;ion on me, that it was not in my Power to decline a Pa&s;&s;ion, which wou'd have united our De&s;tinies: But the Traitor has de|ceiv'd me, and I am going to lo&s;e him for ever, unle&s;s you give immediate Orders to have him &s;eiz'd. What Pretence cou'd I have to act in that manner, (reply'd the Queen, with that Complai&s;ance which was u&s;ual to her) he is
<PB N="94" REF="98">
contracted to <HI>Leonida,</HI> and Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> is in great Power: He has Friends and Rela|tions in this Court, and &s;hou'd I undertake to break his Daughter's Contract in favour of you, it wou'd be doing him the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice. Be&s;ides, with what Authority cou'd I do it? I have no Power over that young Prince: Don't you know he is related to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that a Man of his Quality is not to be dealt with like other People; then con|&s;ider, that the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> his Brother, is actually at <HI>Seville,</HI> and is Son-in-Law to the King of <HI>Navarre;</HI> all the&s;e Things are to be weighed with Deliberation. Ah Madam! re|ply'd <HI>Leonora,</HI> I do not intend to expo&s;e your Maje&s;ty when I intreat you to detain the Prince; you have a good Pretence to do it, without my appearing any ways concern'd. There is an intimate Friend&s;hip between him and <HI>Bena|videz,</HI> and wou'd it not be &s;ufficient to make the World under&s;tand, that the Prince has a Hand in the Rebellion? Your Authority di&s;|pen&s;es you from giving an Account of your Actions, and who dares inquire into your Con|duct? The Prayers and Tears of this old Fa|vourite prevail'd at la&s;t with the Queen, and &s;he con&s;ented that a Captain of the Guards &s;hould go immediately, and put the Prince under Arre&s;t; which was no &s;ooner executed, but the Queen had him brought before her, and having order'd every Body to withdraw, &s;poke to him in the&s;e Terms; What, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, cou'd one have thought you capable
<PB N="95" REF="99">
of betraying us; and that under the Notion of a Friend, you were privately con&s;piring with tho&s;e, who intended to deliver up &s;ome Towns of this Kingdom to the Barbarians? Don't pretend, Prince, to &s;ay any thing in your De|fence, for nothing can ju&s;tify you: I am too well inform'd of your Intreagues; &s;o prepare your &s;elf to undergo the Puni&s;hment you de|&s;erve: Your eminent Birth will not protect you without my Favour, and if I grant you your Life, it &s;hall at lea&s;t be at the Expence of your Liberty. Donna <HI>Leonora</HI> loves you, my Lord, and has already interceded for Grace; if you will marry her, I may in re|gard to her, forget the pernicious De&s;igns you had form'd again&s;t this Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Prince heard, with all the Re&s;pect imaginable, what the Queen had to &s;ay; then an&s;wer'd her with a noble and un|daunted Air; My Heart is incapable, &s;aid he, of forming &s;o mean a De&s;ign, as that which your Maje&s;ty lays to my Charge, and I have too much Intere&s;t in ju&s;tifying my&s;elf to con&s;ent that you &s;hould forget my Crime in Con&s;ideration of <HI>Leonora.</HI> No, Madam, I refu&s;e the Mercy you offer me, and demand nothing but Ju&s;tice; which I have no Cau&s;e to fear be it ever &s;o &s;evere. Go then, Prince, &s;aid the Queen, you &s;hall be &s;trictly guarded, and &s;everely puni&s;hed if guilty.</P>
<P>He was conducted from thence, to the &s;ame Ca&s;tle where <HI>Benavidez</HI> was Pri&s;oner, and con|fin'd &s;everal Days, with Orders that no Body
<PB N="96" REF="100">
&s;hould be admitted to him: However, this Affair could not be carry'd on with &s;o much Secrecy, but that <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> was infor|med how ill they u&s;ed the Prince, for whom he had &s;o great a Value. He addre&s;s'd him|&s;elf to the Queen about it in very warm Terms, and even threatned her with the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Re&s;entment; but &s;he was re&s;olv'd to venture at all, and &s;how no favour to him, un|le&s;s he marry'd <HI>Leonora</HI></P>
<P>This imperious Favourite (who was the on|ly Per&s;on that had leave to &s;ee the Prince) came one Night into his Chamber, richly a|dorn'd with Jewels, but &s;o frightful as to her Per&s;on, that he could hardly prevail with him|&s;elf to look at her. Nothing &s;hall be impo&s;|&s;ible to me (&s;aid &s;he, my lovely Prince, taking him by the Hand) I have every thing in my Power, and if you will marry me, I promi&s;e to deliver you out of this horrible Pri&s;on; but if you are too proud, and de&s;pi&s;e me, be a&s;|&s;ured, you &s;hall pa&s;s the re&s;t of your Days here, or end your Life in a more tragick Man|ner. Ha! (continued &s;he, perceiving in his Countenance a great deal of Anger mix'd with di&s;dain) Do you conceive le&s;s Horror for the Block, than for my Per&s;on? I am not young I confe&s;s; yet &s;uch as you &s;ee me, I can make the Felicity of the greate&s;t Princes in <HI>Spain,</HI> who daily offer me their Sighs and Vows, which with mine I &s;acrifice to you. See, my my dear Prince! See, what a &s;hameful part you make me act; I blu&s;h in confe&s;&s;ing my
<PB N="97" REF="101">
Weakne&s;s, and your Obligation to me ought to be the greater: I, who make all the Court tremble, am here before you, like a Victim, uncertain of Life or Death, waiting its Doom; &s;ay then, will you decide my Fate? You are the only Man that can make me happy, and without you, I am for ever wretched. Whil&s;t <HI>Leonora</HI> was &s;peaking, the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> felt &s;o violent an Aver&s;ion for her, that he cou'd hardly command his Pa&s;&s;ion; but having over|come it a little, he &s;aid, with a very indiffe|rent Air: Are you not yet &s;atisfy'd with what you make me &s;uffer, and will you for ever per&s;ecute me with a Pa&s;&s;ion, to which I can make no Return? I declare, that in my Thoughts, the Misfortune of being belov'd by you, is one of the greate&s;t that could happen to me; and &s;ince my Sincerity offends you, pur&s;ue your Rage, and let your Vengeance fall on a Man, who can reproach him&s;elf with no other Crime, but that of having given you room for &s;ome Time, to believe he cou'd like you. After the&s;e Words, he was &s;ilent, and whatever &s;he cou'd &s;ay to him, he wou'd not make her any An&s;wer.</P>
<P>She ran out of his Chamber like a Fury, threat'ning him with &s;peedy Death, and from thence, went directly to &s;ee <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who was very unea&s;y (as one may well conceive) having been di&s;appointed in his De&s;ign relating to <HI>Leonida,</HI> and not knowing whether &s;he was &s;till at his Hou&s;e, or whether, &s;ince his Con|finement, her Father had not found her out,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
and marry'd her to the Prince of <HI>Carency;</HI> be|&s;ides, he cou'd not tell but the Crime he was accus'd of, tho' innocent, might co&s;t him his Life.</P>
<P>The&s;e Reflections were tormenting him, when he &s;aw <HI>Leonora</HI> coming into his Cham|ber; he cou'd not imagine the Cau&s;e of &s;o un|expected a Favour, and ju&s;t as he was going to make his Retributions to her, &s;he began in the&s;e Terms. <HI>Benavidez</HI> (&s;aid &s;he, with a Voice that expre&s;s'd the Motions of her Soul) your Life or Death now depends on the be&s;t of your Friends; you are impeach'd, and be|lieved guilty: The Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> who loves you entirely, is actually a Pri&s;oner with you in this Ca&s;tle, and I am willing to let you know, that I have conceiv'd a particular E|&s;teem for that Prince; you &s;hall have leave to &s;ee him, and be &s;ure you u&s;e your utmo&s;t En|deavours to per&s;uade him to marry me, in which Ca&s;e, I an&s;wer for your Liberty; but otherwi&s;e, you will have Cau&s;e to fear both for him, and your &s;elf; Farewel Remember now, that your Intere&s;t and mine mu&s;t be the &s;ame. After having &s;poke to him in this man|ner, &s;he gave him no time to make any An|&s;wer, but went away with great Precipita|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez,</HI> who before was de&s;pairing, cou'd not hear this News without being extremely pleas'd: He re&s;olv'd to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Addre&s;s in per&s;uading the Prince; and as he knew the Influence he had over him, he flatter'd him&s;elf
<PB N="99" REF="103">
with ea&s;ily overcoming all Difficulties. What a Happine&s;s will it be, cry'd he, if he yields to <HI>Leonora</HI>'s De&s;ires; I &s;hall then be &s;ure of my charming <HI>Leonida,</HI> and this Favourite, whom I &s;hall oblige, will in Gratitude imploy her Credit to make her mine. I find, it is not, as yet, known where &s;he is; my Hou&s;e has this Trea&s;ure &s;till in its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;oon as I obtain my Liberty, I will go and vi&s;it her in her Retirement. After having imploy'd his Thoughts on &s;o agreeable a Change of For|tune, he could not help reproaching him&s;elf with the treacherous Part he had acted towards his Friend and <HI>Leonida:</HI> No, &s;aid he, I &s;hall never enjoy a real Felicity, &s;ince I mu&s;t be oblig'd to deceive two Per&s;ons, who &s;o entire|ly de&s;erve my Affection, and will be incon&s;o|lable, when they come to know one another, to find their De&s;tiny chang'd by my Perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s. The&s;e Reflections gave him &s;ome Concern; but as his Love tran&s;cended his Friend&s;hip, he re&s;olv'd to arm him&s;elf again&s;t all Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he expected, with great Impatience, to &s;peak with the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> was u&s;ing all his Endeavours to get him out of Pri&s;on. He at la&s;t brib'd one of the Guards, who having brought Ropes and a File, help'd to cut the Bars of his Window; and the Night being very dark, they both e|&s;cap'd on Hor&s;es that were waiting for them.</P>
<P>But this could not be done &s;o &s;ecretly, as not to alarm &s;ome of the Guards, who heard
<PB N="100" REF="104">
a Noi&s;e in the Prince's Apartment, which they enter'd, and perceiving his Flight, went imme|diately to give Notice of it to <HI>Leonora.</HI> This News made her furious. She order'd &s;everal Hor&s;emen, who were all devoted to her Inte|re&s;t, to pur&s;ue him; and was &s;o confounded, that without knowing what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he com|manded them to take different Ways, and told 'em, that in ca&s;e they overtook him, and cou'd not prevail with him to return, they &s;hou'd kill him: But after they had left her, and the fir&s;t Effects of her Pa&s;&s;ion were over, &s;he re|flected on the cruel Commands &s;he had given, and did not at all doubt but they wou'd be too well executed by tho&s;e Villains. What! cry'd &s;he, am I going to be the Murderer of a Man, for whom I wou'd willingly lay down my Life; and do I convey the Poinyard to his Brea&s;t? Oh unju&s;t Fate! Why are you not contented with taking from me the Object I love, without making me the Author of his Death? Being thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with di&s;mal Thoughts, &s;he was no more Mi&s;tre&s;s of her &s;elf; &s;he &s;ent immediately to countermand her inhuman Orders; but alas! it was too late, they had kill'd the Prince in &s;pite of his brave Re&s;i&s;tance, which was &s;o great, that he wou'd not have been overcome but by a va&s;t Supe|riority.</P>
<P><HI>Leonora</HI> was &s;aluted with this News at <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> which &s;he receiv'd as one who already expected it, and had no other Thought, but that of dying. The Prayers and Tears of the
<PB N="101" REF="105">
Queen were of no force. She tore her Hair and wounded her Face, and her extreme Grief &s;oon forwarded her Death, which made &s;ome Atonement for the Barbarity &s;he had ju&s;t caus'd to be acted on one of the fine&s;t Princes in the World.</P>
<P>Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> and his Lady were in|con&s;olable for his Lo&s;s, reproaching them&s;elves for not giving him a &s;ufficient Guard; they regretted him as if he had been their own Child, and loaded with Imprecations the Me|mory of <HI>Leonora. Benavidez</HI> not being &s;o &s;trictly guarded as before, was &s;oon inform'd of the Prince's Death; but his Love triumph'd over his Gratitude, which made him perfectly in&s;en&s;ible of the Misfortune of a Per&s;on, who had lov'd him &s;o entirely.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Things were pa&s;&s;ing at Court, <HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> under the Names of <HI>Feli|cia</HI> and <HI>Beatricia,</HI> were &s;trangely alarm'd in their Solitude; the Gentleman who had left them &s;afe there, acquainted them with <HI>Benavi|dez</HI>'s being made a Pri&s;oner of State, and accus'd of having a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Moors. Ca&s;ilda</HI> at this News, was re&s;olv'd to go back to <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> in order to intetcede for her Bro|ther, and do him what Service &s;he was capa|ble of; but <HI>Leonida,</HI> who fear'd to remain there alone, repre&s;ented to her, that as <HI>Leono|ra</HI> was not her Friend, and that through her means, &s;he had already lo&s;t the Queen's Fa|vour, her Pre&s;ence in&s;tead of mending her Bro|ther's Affairs, would make them wor&s;e; that

be&s;ides, &s;he wou'd have the Mortification of &s;eeing <HI>Henriquez</HI> marry'd to Donna <HI>Blanca,</HI> which wou'd only renew her Grief: The&s;e Arguments wou'd not have prevail'd with <HI>Ca|&s;ilda,</HI> had &s;he not apprehended, that in leaving <HI>Leonida,</HI> who in the mean Time might return to her Father's Hou&s;e, <HI>Benavidez</HI> wou'd lo&s;e all the Fruits of her artificial Management; which Con&s;ideration prevented her Journey.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> us'd often to walk in a Fore&s;t near their Hou&s;e; and one Evening, as they were &s;itting by the &s;ide of a Rivulet, a Hor&s;e ran by, in a full Gallop, which frighten'd them very much, &s;eeing no Body on his Back; they quitted the Place ha&s;tily, and as they were in their Way towards the Ca&s;tle, their Surprize was much greater, when they per|ceiv'd two Men lying on the Ground wound|ed, and cover'd with Blood; &s;uch a Sight was very frightful to the&s;e young Ladies, who be|lieving they were dead, dur&s;t not approach them, but ran home, and call'd &s;ome of their Servants, with whom they immediately came back, in order to give A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the&s;e two Gentlemen, if happily it were not too late.</P>
<P>The Ladies now having &s;ome Attendance with them, came up to the&s;e unknown Cava|liers, and found that one of them was already dead, and the other &s;till breathing. <HI>Leonid&agrave;,</HI> who had hitherto &s;een all Mankind with In|differency, &s;eem'd to have &s;omething more than Compa&s;&s;ion for the Misfortune of this Stranger, whom one might judge, by his no|ble
<PB N="103" REF="107">
Air and Dre&s;s, to be of the fir&s;t Quality; and as <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> appear'd to be equally concern'd, <HI>Leonida</HI> did not &s;o much wonder at the Effects it produc'd in her.</P>
<P>Oh! what pity wou'd it be (cry'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> looking at <HI>Ca&s;ilda)</HI> &s;hou'd this Stranger die; but what hopes can one have of his Life? It is po&s;&s;ible, he is now expiring. In &s;aying this, &s;he &s;prinkl'd Water on his Face, and laid his Head on her Knees, whil&s;t <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> caus'd a &s;ort of Carriage to be made with the Branches of a Tree; at la&s;t fetching a Sigh, he open'd his Eyes, and perceiving <HI>Leonida,</HI> made an Effort to &s;peak to her; but his Spirits being wa&s;ted, he fell into a Swoon, which gave them rea&s;on to believe his Life was in danger.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (whom I mu&s;t now call <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Beatricia,)</HI> when the Carriage was fini&s;h'd, order'd their Servants to lay the Stranger on it, and thus they convey'd him to their Hou&s;e, in great Silence, being perplex'd with &s;uch a multitude of Thoughts, as wou'd not admit of any Interruption. As &s;oon as they were there, they &s;ent to <HI>Carmona</HI> for a Surgeon, who after having probed his Wounds, told them they were not Mortal: This agree|able News chang'd the Scene of Sorrow, into that of Joy. <HI>Felicia</HI> went to his Bed-&s;ide, and by this time he had recover'd his Speech, which he imploy'd in returning Thanks for her Genero&s;ity. I can no longer deplore (&s;aid he, in a feeble Voice) the di&s;mal Adventure that had happen'd to me, &s;ince it gives me an Op|portunity
<PB N="104" REF="108">
of knowing the mo&s;t de&s;erving Per|&s;on in the World; but I fear, Madam, my being in your Hou&s;e may incommode you, which extremely le&s;&s;ens the Satisfaction I &s;hou'd have to be where you are: In &s;aying the&s;e Words, he look'd at her with &s;o much Admiration and Plea&s;ure, that had &s;he under|&s;tood the Language of his Eyes, &s;he wou'd have ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd at the Motions of his Heart. Do not be unea&s;y, Sir (reply'd &s;he) you &s;hall want for no A&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor have rea&s;on to ap|prehend we &s;ee you here with Di&s;plea&s;ure; you are now in a Condition wherein Silence and Re&s;t are equally nece&s;&s;ary, which Rea&s;on induces me to leave you: with that, &s;he retir'd, and left <HI>Beatricia</HI> behind her; who, as &s;oon as <HI>Felicia</HI> was gone, approach'd the Bed, and &s;aid to him; Tho' may Si&s;ter hath a&s;&s;ured you how de&s;irous we are to be &s;erviceable to you, yet I mu&s;t repeat the &s;ame, and conjure you, Sir, to have no other Thought but that of recovering your Health. It will be no ea&s;y matter, Madam, reply'd the Prince, to recover in a Place, where the Objects I &s;ee, may prove more Dangerous to me, than the Wounds I have receiv'd. <HI>Beatricia</HI> (who did not doubt but the&s;e Words were ad|dre&s;s'd to her) &s;eem'd not to comprehend their meaning; but taking leave of him, went to <HI>Feli|cia</HI>'s Apartment, and ask'd her what the Stranger had &s;aid to her. She, without di&s;&s;embling, gave her an Account of their Conver&s;ation, which very much pleas'd <HI>Beatricia.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf more o|bligingly
<PB N="105" REF="109">
to me than he did to you: The&s;e Words gave &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Felicia,</HI> with|out knowing from whence it proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Beatricia</HI> (who was in a different Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind) propos'd to her &s;elf, that the only means to bani&s;h Don <HI>Henriquez</HI> from her Heart, was to yield it to another. Whatever Trouble a new Inclination may give me, thought &s;he, it never can be equal to the Pain I endure. The Man I love, is now in the Arms of Donna <HI>Blanca,</HI> and all my hopes on that &s;ide are vani&s;h'd; but in placing my Affection on &s;ome other Object it may be kindly return'd. I had Cau&s;e enough to apprehend, that <HI>Felicia</HI> wou'd appear more beautiful than me, in the Eyes of this lovely Stranger, but his Words have convinc'd me of the contrary, and I am re&s;olv'd to be favourable to him, whatever may be the Event: Love is a plea&s;ing Tor|ment.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> continued ill &s;ome time; and during his Illne&s;s, receiv'd daily In&s;tances of the Genero&s;ity of the&s;e Ladies, particularly <HI>Felicia</HI>'s obliging Behaviour to him (on all occa&s;ions) made him de&s;irous to expre&s;s his Gratitude. He began to think his Pre&s;er|vation was chiefly owing to her tender Care, and by Degrees fell de&s;perately in Love, which threw into the following Reflections: How difficult a Task will it be, to make an Impre&s;|&s;ion on that unpractis'd Heart? Her mode&s;t Looks, and the Blu&s;hes which cover her Cheeks, every time I ca&s;t my Eyes on her,
<PB N="106" REF="110">
evince how little &s;he his acquainted with Love; and dare I flatter my &s;elf with &s;ucceed|ing in &s;uch an Attempt? No, I mu&s;t not hope for &s;o great a Favour from Fortune. I was be|lov'd at <HI>Nicopolis</HI> by a Per&s;on I never knew; I no &s;ooner became Captive to the Charms of a Lady at <HI>Genoa,</HI> but Death &s;natch'd the dear Object from me; and lately as I arriv'd at <HI>Vil|la-Real</HI> with a Re&s;olution to marry <HI>Leonida,</HI> I was inform'd of her Flight and Aver&s;ion to me. Alas! my unkind Stars were not &s;atisfy'd to afflict me with all the&s;e Misfortunes. They have &s;ent me a greater one; <HI>Leonora</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion for me! Her de&s;perate Rage caus'd me to be treated in this barbarous manner; and her Cruelty wou'd &s;till threaten my Days with the greate&s;t Dangers, were &s;he inform'd that I had e&s;cap'd, and was now in this Place; but Oh! how can I re&s;olve to leave <HI>Felicia,</HI> who is already more dear to me, than the Life I wou'd endeavour to pre&s;erve? All I can do in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State, is to change my Name: I am inclin'd to believe, that as I was taken for the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> I may pa&s;s for the &s;ame here, where I am not known. If it be my good Fortune to render my Senti|ments agreeable to this lovely Charmer, I &s;hall never wi&s;h for a greater Ble&s;&s;ing. I do not doubt but &s;he has an Affection for her Si&s;ter, therefore I mu&s;t addre&s;s my &s;elf to her, and ob|tain Favour, if po&s;&s;ible by her means. The Prince us'd often to entertain him&s;elf after this manner, betwixt Hope and Fear.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="111">
<HI>Beatricia</HI> one Morning ro&s;e earlier than <HI>Fe|licia,</HI> and went to &s;ee the Prince, who was a|wake, and had re&s;ted very ill all Night. A&s;&s;oon as he &s;aw her enter the Chamber, he thank'd her for &s;o obliging a Care, and told her, he hop'd &s;he had repos'd much better than he had done. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I have felt &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, which I mu&s;t lay to your Charge, &s;ince it proceeds from the Curio&s;ity I have to know who you are, and the Uncertainty I am in of being &s;atisfy'd on that Subject. You judge very unfavourably of my Gratitude, Madam, reply'd the Prince, if you think me capable of not obeying your Com|mands. I am of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Fie&s;que;</HI> my Title is the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> I have been &s;ome Years in my Travels, and as I was riding thro' the neighbouring Fore&s;t, in my Way to <HI>Seville,</HI> I was a&s;&s;aulted by Rob|bers: I did my Endeavour to re&s;i&s;t them, but their Number overpower'd me, and left me, Madam, in the Condition you &s;aw me. I know your Family, my Lord, reply'd <HI>Beatricia,</HI> and cou'd have judg'd in &s;eeing you, that your Extraction was illu&s;trious. The Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> (for now I mu&s;t give that Title to the Prince of <HI>Carency)</HI> interrupted her, to enquire after <HI>Felicia,</HI> but with a kind of Impatience, which did not very much plea&s;e <HI>Beatricia,</HI> who in a cold manner, made An&s;wer, &s;he had not as yet &s;een her. As &s;he was &s;peaking, the Surgeon came in to the dre&s;s Prince's Wounds, &s;o &s;he thought fit to retire. She went directly from thence to <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Apartment, who was
<PB N="108" REF="112">
ju&s;t ri&s;ing. What, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Beatricia,</HI> dre&s;s'd already! How comes it, Si&s;ter, you are up &s;o early! I can give you no other Rea&s;on, re|ply'd &s;he, only I was a&s;ham'd to lie a Bed &s;o fine a Morning: But will you believe I have been to vi&s;it the Stranger, and that I know his Name and Country. You may as well &s;ay, interrupted <HI>Felicica,</HI> that you know al&s;o the Secrets of his Heart. No, reply'd <HI>Beatricia</HI> &s;miling, I am very &s;incere, and can a&s;&s;ure you, our Conver&s;ation ended with his acquainting me, that he is of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and is call'd the Count of <HI>La Vagne.</HI> As you are to vi&s;it him next, perhaps you may learn &s;omething more. I have not &s;o much Curio&s;ity as you imagine, reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> and I fancy I &s;hall trouble him but very little with my Pre&s;ence. Accordingly &s;he did not go into the Prince's Chamber till late in the Evening, being then inform'd, he was very ill; for his Unea&s;ine&s;s at not &s;eeing her all that Day, and the Pain occa&s;ion'd by his Wounds, had thrown him into a violent Fever. As &s;oon as &s;he approach'd his Bed, he look'd at her with much Tenderne&s;s, and &s;aid, I flatter'd my &s;elf more than I ought to have done, Madam, in thinking the Conditi|on I am in, had mov'd your Pity, &s;ince I find at pre&s;ent, nothing touch'd you but the &s;ad A&s;pect of a dying Man, pierc'd with Wounds, and lying in a Sea of Blood. You abandon me, charming <HI>Felicia,</HI> and take no Care to pre&s;erve the Life of an unhappy Wretch, who is indebted to you alone, for the &s;mall Share
<PB N="109" REF="113">
he has left of it. I would not incommode you with a Vi&s;it, my Lord, reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> my Si&s;ter having told me this Morning, that in the State you are in, nothing was more nece&s;&s;ary than Repo&s;e. No, no, Madam, (&s;aid he, interrupt|ing her) you have not thought on me. Donna <HI>Beatricia</HI> did not hinder you from coming to &s;ee me; your Eyes convince me of the Truth, and you only wi&s;h my Recovery, to bani&s;h me your Pre&s;ence for ever. He &s;aid this with an Air &s;o moving, that &s;he cou'd not help &s;howing in her Looks more Affection, than Indifferen|cy. You have been here &s;o little a while, re|ply'd &s;he, that I hardly have had time to con|&s;ult my Inclinations, yet give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that I find nothing in them to your Preju|dice; and &s;hou'd very much regret my having known you, if I thought in leaving this Place, you wou'd entirely forget me. She expre&s;s'd the&s;e la&s;t Words blu&s;hing, and with &s;ome Fear, which charm'd the Prince, who was going to make his Retributions, when <HI>Beatricia</HI> enter'd the Chamber, in &s;ome Di&s;order: One of my Women, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, who is ju&s;t re|turn'd from walking in the Fore&s;t, found this Picture in the &s;ame Place where we fir&s;t &s;aw you. I &s;uppo&s;e it is yours, and the Per&s;on it repre&s;ents, is too charming, not to merit all your Affection. The Prince told her, it was true, the Picture had been recommended to his Care, and receiv'd it with a deep Sigh. It was that which <HI>Olympia Doria</HI> had pre&s;ented to him. This gave much Unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Feli|cia,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="114">
who cou'd not help de&s;iring to &s;ee it, but had hardly turn'd her Eyes on it, when her Mind was fill'd with Trouble; which to con|ceal, &s;he retired to her Clo&s;et, where being a|lone: I thought, &s;aid &s;he, I had only <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> to fear; but alas! my Fate is much more &s;e|vere; for certainly the Per&s;on he loves is the mo&s;t beautiful Creature in the World, and his Pa&s;&s;ion is return'd, &s;ince &s;he has given him her Picture. If he &s;hou'd cea&s;e to love her on my Account, it would be a Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s that might give me room to fear in my turn a re|&s;embling De&s;tiny; and if he is con&s;tant to her, what can I hope? She yielded her &s;elf up to the&s;e &s;ad Reflections, and leaving them for o|thers more tormenting: Oh! continued &s;he, cou'd any thing be more fatal than this la&s;t Adventure? I flew from the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> becau&s;e my Parents wou'd have me marry con|trary to my Inclination. I thought my &s;elf &s;afe in this Fore&s;t, where I only apprehended to meet with wild Bea&s;ts; but the&s;e fierce Ani|mals have done me no harm: It is a Stranger, a dying Man, that has deprived me of my Peace, and made me acquainted with Sentiments, I thought <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Heart incapable of receiving. A &s;hower of Tears attended the&s;e Words, and &s;he re&s;olv'd never more to &s;ee this dangerous Cavalier; for which rea&s;on &s;he feign'd an In|di&s;po&s;ition, and confin'd her &s;elf to her Bed; but cou'd not help enquiring after the Count, who was now extremely ill. His Fever was very much increas'd by his not &s;eeing <HI>Felicia,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="115">
and his anxious Reflections &s;o tormented him, that he thought of nothing but Death.</P>
<P>He was in evident danger, when <HI>Beatricia</HI> enter'd <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Chamber all in Tears. There are no hopes left Si&s;ter, cry'd &s;he; the unhappy Count is dying. If you have a mind to &s;ee him before he expires, you have no time to lo&s;e. <HI>Felicia</HI> was not prepar'd for this di&s;a|greeable News, which had like to have thrown her into a Swoon; but being a little recover'd, &s;he repented the ob&s;tinate Re&s;olution &s;he had made, to &s;ee him no more. She thought now &s;he was going to lo&s;e him for ever, and that &s;uch a Lo&s;s wou'd make her the mo&s;t unfortu|nate Per&s;on in the World.

<P>She ran into his Chamber whil&s;t he was in a fainting Fit; his Eyes were &s;hut, and he had neither Voice nor Pul&s;e.

At la&s;t he fetch'd a deep Sigh, and opening his Eyes, was tran&s;ported to find his dear <HI>Felicia</HI> near him, and &s;o touch'd at his Illne&s;s: He look'd langui&s;hing at her, and making an Effort to &s;peak; Ah! divine <HI>Felicia,</HI> &s;aid he, is it you that gives me A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and are you come to &s;ave me from Death?

<P>How much were the&s;e Lovers to be pitied, not knowing each other?

She cou'd not help being very much &s;urpri|zed, when &s;he &s;aw the Count, who fell at her Feet without having power to &s;peak one Word.

They looked at one another, as if they had met after a long Ab&s;ence; at la&s;t the Count broke Silence: You have in&s;pired me, Madam, &s;aid he, with a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o tran&s;cendent, that you mu&s;t needs have perceived it in all my A|ctions, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I thought you took &s;ome Pity on me, but I have too much Cau&s;e to believe the contrary, &s;ince your Looks ex|pre&s;s the utmo&s;t Indifference.

We are both in a di&s;|order, &s;aid &s;he, which we might have avoided, had you not &s;poke to me of your Pa&s;&s;ion. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my Lord, to my Shame, that

Oh Madam! cry'd the Count, (in a Rapture) judge better of a Man whom you have ju&s;t loaded with your Favours, and do not &s;u&s;pect Ingratitude from a Heart, that bears your I|mage; be a&s;&s;ured, a Per&s;on who &s;ighs for you, can never think of any other Object.

As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he reflected on all that had pa&s;s'd.

<P>The Count being retired to his Chamber, pa&s;s'd his time the mo&s;t agreeably in the World, when he call'd to mind <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Gene|ro&s;ity, but could hardly flatter him&s;elf with the Succe&s;s he wi&s;h'd for.

What! &s;aid &s;he; &s;hall I &s;uffer this ungrateful Man to be ble&s;s'd with the &s;ight of my Rival, and omit acquainting my Brother with an adventure, wherein he is &s;o much con|cern'd?

This fatal Letter threw the Count into &s;uch an Agony, that he was like a Man who felt the Tortures of an approaching Death; he turn'd pale, and all his Sen&s;es abandon'd him. <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (who was prepar'd for this di&s;mal Scene) took care that &s;peedy A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hou'd be given him, and by the Help and Force of Remedies, he &s;oon came to him&s;elf; he open'd his Eyes, and &s;eeing &s;everal Per&s;ons about him, made Signs to them to withdraw; which they obey'd, and left <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> with him in the Chamber: He look'd at her &s;ome time, with|out being able to utter one Word; at la&s;t, having recover'd his Speech, he &s;aid in a feeble Accent; It was unkind in you, Madam, to acquaint me with the greate&s;t Misfortune that cou'd ever happen to me. No, my Lord, in|terrupted <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> I do not de&s;erve a Reproach; it is but rea&s;onable you &s;hou'd be inform'd of <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Sentiments; after what &s;he has done for <HI>Benavidez.</HI> Who is this you name, the Prince &s;uddenly reply'd: I name Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez</HI> my Brother, &s;aid &s;he, and the Lady who went here by the Name of <HI>Felicia</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> is <HI>Leonida</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co;</HI> her Father had contracted her to the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> who is highly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by his eminent Birth and per&s;onal Merit; but having conceiv'd a ten|der Affection for my Brother, &s;he preferr'd this Retirement to the Court, and wou'd not wait the unwelcome Arrival of a Per&s;on to whom her Father had de&s;tin'd her. We came away together from <HI>Villa Real,</HI> and ever &s;ince, &s;he
<PB N="129" REF="133">
has continued a mutual Corre&s;pondence with my Brother; her going away with him la&s;t Night, is an Evincement of this Truth. The Prince, at the&s;e Words, broke out into &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionate a Grief, that it wou'd have mov'd the mo&s;t inhuman Heart with Pity. O cruel For|tune! cry'd he, will you never cea&s;e to per&s;e|cute me? Was it then <HI>Leonida</HI> I &s;aw, and to who&s;e potent Charms I yielded, only to make me more wretched, through her Incon&s;tancy? The ungrateful Fair betrays and flies me; and that dear Friend too, that &s;ame <HI>Benavidez</HI> for whom I &s;acrific'd my &s;elf, he is the Man who has impos'd on my Credulity; he is in Love with the Woman to whom I am promis'd, and the Traitor de&s;crib'd her to me as a Mon&s;ter, to make me conceive an Aver&s;ion for her. Is this all the Reward I mu&s;t expect, after having ador'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> and &s;o entirely lov'd <HI>Benavidez? Ca&s;ilda</HI> was in the greate&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment imagi|nable, to hear the Prince expre&s;s him&s;elf in the&s;e Terms. She ea&s;ily under&s;tood by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he was the &s;ame Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> whom the Count of <HI>La March</HI> his Father had contracted to <HI>Leonida;</HI> but her Surprize was the greater, becau&s;e &s;he thought the Prince, not finding <HI>Leonida</HI> at <HI>Villa Real,</HI> was return'd to <HI>France;</HI> and as &s;he knew nothing of his Adventure with <HI>Leonora,</HI> &s;he cou'd not well conceive, by what Accident he had been attack'd in the Fore&s;t, and why he had chang'd his Name: The&s;e different Cir|cum&s;tances wholly employ'd her Thoughts.
<PB N="130" REF="134">
The Prince, on the other &s;ide, cou'd not mode|rate his Grief; he was like a Per&s;on depriv'd of his Sen&s;es; what with Sighs, Tears and Menaces, no Man ever appear'd in a more deplorable Condition.</P>
<P>What need you, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, expre&s;s &s;o much Concern for <HI>Leonida?</HI> She never lov'd you: you &s;ee &s;he has prefer'd <HI>Benavidez,</HI> and forgets even the Rules of Mode&s;ty, to follow her Lover: Why then will you &s;uffer &s;o much for an ungrateful Woman, who merits not your Con&s;ideration? Oh, Madam! cry'd the Prince, I know not what I do; my De&s;pair is &s;o great, that I am no longer Ma&s;ter of my Rea&s;on; my Misfortunes are not to be comprehended; I find my &s;elf betray'd by a Per&s;on, who was contracted to me from her Infancy, and by a Friend to whom I had confided the Secrets of my Soul. <HI>Leonida,</HI> who &s;eem'd to approve my Pa&s;&s;ion, has deceiv'd me, and added Con|tempt to her Ingratitude; &s;he knew I ador'd her, yet the perfidious Fair receiv'd my Vows, only to &s;acrifice them to another. Ju&s;t Hea|ven! revenge me of this perjur'd Beauty: But what do I &s;ay, continued he, a Moment after? I have not Re&s;olution enough to wi&s;h her the Puni&s;hment &s;he de&s;erves: She is dear to me in &s;pite of all, and I will do my utmo&s;t Endea|vours to regain her. Oh! I love her, and love her to Di&s;traction. The Force of my Re&s;ent|ment mu&s;t fall on the Traitor <HI>Benavidez;</HI> his Blood &s;hall attone for the Affront I have re|ceiv'd.

Lord, interrupted <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> if <HI>Leonida</HI> lov'd him le&s;s; but you have &s;ufficient Cau&s;e to believe by the Letter &s;he left, and his Flight, that &s;he is now marry'd to him; They are gone together to <HI>Ja&euml;n;</HI> Don <HI>Alonzo,</HI> who is Governor of that Town, and my Brother's Uncle, approves his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, and will protect him; Believe me then, the De&s;ign you form is impractica|ble. Do you think <HI>Benavidez</HI> wou'd have made &s;uch a Step, without taking all nece&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ures for it? Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> is one of the greate&s;t Men in <HI>Spain,</HI> and my Brother knowing his Power, has carry'd her to a Place where he defies his Enemies. His Precautions (interrupted the Prince) will be ineffectual a|gain&s;t me; I neither fear Danger nor Death, and if I revenge my Wrongs, I &s;hall die with Content.</P>
<P>Live, my Lord, (reply'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> blu&s;hing) Oh! live for me, &s;ince my Pa&s;&s;ion for you is tran&s;cendent.

Ah, my Lord! can Sentiments &s;o tender make no Impre&s;&s;ion? My Fortune is great, and my Family one of the fir&s;t in <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> then let our Hearts be &s;o united as we may be for ever happy.

<HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> was thus declaring her Mind to the Prince, and flattering her &s;elf with Succe&s;s, he walked di&s;tractedly up and down the Cham|ber with his Arms cro&s;s'd, taking &s;o little no|tice of her Di&s;cour&s;e, that he neither look'd at her, nor made any An&s;wer; but like a Man in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, was leaving the Apartment, without knowing what he did, or where to direct his Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (who cou'd not bear the Thoughts of lo&s;ing the Prince) had no longer Rea&s;on in her Words or Actions, but ran and &s;top'd him, with her Face drown'd in Tears. Will you go, Barbarian, &s;aid &s;he? What! will you fly me, and abandon a Woman that adores you, to fol|low perfidious <HI>Leonida?</HI> Leave her with my Brother; de&s;pi&s;e her, and to compleat your Revenge, even forget her, &s;ince by her Beha|viour &s;he has render'd her &s;elf unworthy of your Love. My Quality is equal to hers, and what I have &s;uperior to her, is my Con&s;tancy: But what do I &s;ee? Oh Heavens! cry'd &s;he (looking at him) with what Ingratitude am I rewarded? You leave me to expo&s;e your &s;elf to the greate&s;t Dangers: you&mdash;She was going to continue her Di&s;cour&s;e, when the Prince interrupted her. What wou'd you have me do, Madam, &s;aid he? Can I love any thing but <HI>Leonida?</HI> and were I capable of a Change, cou'd it be in Favour of the Si&s;ter of <HI>Benavidez?</HI> Ah! do you deprive me even of Hope, which is not deny'd the mo&s;t Unfortu|nate? (reply'd &s;he, &s;hedding a Shower of
<PB N="133" REF="137">
Tears, where Fury had no le&s;s a Share than Love;) but inhuman as you are, don't think to live in Peace with your Cruelty; I will find means to torment you, and make you re|pent the little Regard you have to my Suf|ferings.</P>
<P>The Prince did not &s;tay to make any An|&s;wer to <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> whom he left in her Chamber, without either Strength to follow him, or Power to &s;peak a Word; but was meditating on &s;everal violent De&s;igns, being divided be|tween Love, Jealou&s;y, and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>After this Scene, it is not to be imagin'd the Prince wou'd remain in <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Hou&s;e. He re&s;olv'd immediately to go to <HI>Carmona,</HI> where he thought he might hear &s;omething concerning <HI>Leonida;</HI> and as that Town was in his way to <HI>Ja&euml;n</HI> (which was the Place men|tion'd in her Letter to <HI>Ca&s;ilda)</HI> he was in hopes, by a &s;trict Enquiry, to di&s;cover the Road <HI>Be|navidez</HI> had taken. With this De&s;ign he &s;et out, but cou'd not help complaining of the Adver&s;ity of his Fortune. Can I ever flatter my &s;elf, &s;aid he, with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Heart, that has &s;o inhumanly betray'd me? What Motive cou'd induce <HI>Leonida</HI> to act in &s;o de|ceitful a manner? Was it only to &s;acrifice me to <HI>Benavidez?</HI> No, I cannot harbour &s;uch in|jurious Thoughts of one, who appear'd &s;o mo|de&s;t and virtuous. Then calling to mind, that &s;he had told him &s;he was engag'd; Why, cruel Creature, (&s;aid he, as if he were &s;peaking to her) why did not you entirely confide in me?
<PB N="134" REF="138">
You are engag'd it's true, &s;ince I am the Man to whom you are contracted. We &s;hou'd have known each other, and perhaps you might have lov'd me; but in&s;tead of acting &s;incerely, you have carry'd your Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s to an Ex|tremity. You li&s;ten'd to my tran&s;cendent Pa&s;|&s;ion, and flatter'd me with a Return only to make my De&s;pair proportionable.</P>
<P>Had his Di&s;traction been of a more moderate Nature, it is probable he wou'd have apprehend|ed farther Con&s;equences from the Fury and Re|&s;entment of <HI>Leonora,</HI> (for as yet he was not inform'd of her Death;) be&s;ides, he had no mind to go to <HI>Seville,</HI> for fear of &s;eeing the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> his Brother, to whom he wou'd be oblig'd to relate his Adventure with <HI>Leonida,</HI> and the Error &s;he had been guilty of, which he cou'd not re&s;olve, being of a gene|rous Temper, and incapable of &s;aying any thing to the Prejudice of a Lady he lov'd &s;o entirely.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;tacles at another Time wou'd have embara&s;s'd the Prince, but in this Con|juncture, they did not in the lea&s;t affect him, for his Thoughts were wholly imploy'd on the Mea&s;ures he &s;hou'd take to recover his dear <HI>Leonida.</HI> He arriv'd at <HI>Carmona,</HI> and tho' in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, was pre&s;ently known to be a Foreigner by the Fairne&s;s of his Complexion, and Colour of his Hair; he carry'd in his Countenance &s;uch Marks of Melancholy, that no Body cou'd &s;ee him without Concern. The Governour of that Place was &s;oon acquainted
<PB N="135" REF="139">
with his Arrival; and as he had receiv'd Or|ders from Court, not to let any Stranger pa&s;s that Way, without Examination, hearing he was a Per&s;on of Quality and a Foreigner, out of a Compliment he paid a Vi&s;it to the Prince, who receiv'd him with &s;o much Politene&s;s and Grandeur, that after a &s;hort Conver&s;ation and many Offers of Service, the Governour invited him to accept of an Apartment in the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Prince return'd his Civility in a mo&s;t obliging manner, and de&s;ired to be excus'd, becau&s;e his Affairs wou'd not permit him to &s;tay above one Night at <HI>Carmona;</HI> but the o|ther, unwilling to be deny'd, repeated his Im|portunities, and with much Difficulty, per|&s;uaded him to comply with his Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>A noble Entertainment was prepar'd in the Ca&s;tle for the Prince, who cou'd not &s;uppre&s;s his violent Chagrin; which the Governour per|ceiv'd, but wou'd not enquire into the Cau&s;e, He under&s;tood by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that his De|&s;ign was to go to <HI>Ja&euml;n,</HI> and as he had a Son, who commanded a Company in the Citadel of that Place, and who&s;e Name was Don <HI>Gabriel d'Agular,</HI> he told the Prince very obligingly, that if he approv'd of it, he wou'd write to him, in order to acquaint him with his Arrival there; and added, that if it were in his Son's power to &s;erve him, he was &s;atisfy'd he wou'd neglect no Opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his Readine&s;s.</P>
<P>This free and gallant Behaviour of the Go|vernour, engag'd the Prince to accept his Of|fer
<PB N="136" REF="140">
with the &s;ame Freedom. He knew no Body at <HI>Ja&euml;n;</HI> and as he wanted the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Per&s;on in whom he cou'd confide, to en|ter privately the Citadel, where he thought <HI>Benavidez</HI> and <HI>Leonida</HI> were retired, he the more willingly embrac'd &s;o favourable an Oc|ca&s;ion. The next Day having made his Ac|knowledgments to the Governour for his ex|traordinary Favours, he took Leave of him, and left <HI>Carmona,</HI> but not without acquainting Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> with what had pa&s;s'd, that he might act on his &s;ide for the Recove|ry of <HI>Leonida.</HI> Never was Surprize greater, than that which his Letters caus'd at Court; for Don <HI>John</HI> and his Lady were per&s;uaded the Prince had been kill'd by <HI>Leonora</HI>'s A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. One may imagine how great was their Joy, when they heard Heaven had pre&s;erv'd him, yet it cou'd no ways alleviate their inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief for the Lo&s;s of their Daughter. They immediately thought of means to get her away from <HI>Ja&euml;n,</HI> where they believ'd &s;he was; but whil&s;t the Prince is on his Journey thither, let us &s;ee what becomes of unfortunate <HI>Leo|nida.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez</HI> had brought her out of the Park, he &s;at her on Hor&s;eback before him, and held her with &s;uch Force, that all the Efforts &s;he made to di&s;en|gage her&s;elf, were in vain. She cry'd out, and implor'd Heaven and Earth for Succour. She call'd the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but her Cries and Tears had no Power. He
<PB N="137" REF="141">
led her through uncommon Ways, over Moun|tains and Rocks, where the Ecchoes an&s;wering her Complaints, rather augmented her Sorrow, than le&s;&s;en'd it.</P>
<P>Whoever you be, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> you are the mo&s;t unju&s;t of Mortals, to u&s;e this Violence with me. I never gave any One Cau&s;e to treat me after &s;o cruel a manner. Why will you take Plea&s;ure in di&s;turbing the Peace of my Life? By what Authority do you act thus? If my Father has &s;ent you, I am di&s;pos'd to obey his Orders, without being under the Nece&s;&s;ity of travelling all Night with a Troop of Men, as if I were a Criminal. Oh! let us &s;top (continued &s;he, &s;eeing he made no An&s;wer) I conjure you, carry me back to the Place where you found me; you need not ap|prehend my E&s;cape, &s;ince I am alone there with a young Lady, who&s;e Brother is now Pri&s;oner at <HI>Villa Real,</HI> and were he at Home, he has too great a Re&s;pect for my Family, to oppo&s;e my Father's Commands. Here her Tears interrupted her Complaint, and forc'd her to be &s;ome time &s;ilent. She began to be per&s;uaded, the&s;e Men were come to take her away by the Order of Don <HI>John,</HI> who &s;he thought had been inform'd of the Place of her Retreat, and of the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI>'s be|ing there. She tenderly regretted the Ab&s;ence of her Lover. If he knew (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) where they are carrying me, I &s;hou'd have le&s;s rea&s;on to be unea&s;y; for certainly he wou'd &s;oon find means to &s;ee me. His Birth and
<PB N="138" REF="142">
Merit are &s;ufficient Recommendations to inti|tle him to my Father's Favour, who being once convinc'd of the Aver&s;ion the Prince of <HI>Caren|cy</HI> and I have to each other, wou'd undoubted|ly con&s;ent to break off the Match, and yield me to the Count. Thus &s;he travell'd all Night, entertaining her&s;elf with Reflections of this Quality.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Aurora</HI> di&s;play'd her gilded Beams, <HI>Leonida</HI> endeavour'd to know the Per&s;on who was carrying her off; But Heavens! cou'd any &s;urprize be equal to her's when &s;he &s;aw it was <HI>Benavidez?</HI> At fir&s;t &s;he had not power to &s;peak, her Tears prevented her Ut|terance, whil&s;t a Thou&s;and different Ideas pre&s;ented them&s;elves to her Mind. She at la&s;t cry'd aloud, (no longer doubting of her Mis|fortune) are you become my Enemy Don <HI>Fer|nand?</HI> you who offer'd me your Hou&s;e to con|ceal me, and in whom I had that Confidence.

What! were all my Pains and Cares de&s;ign'd for this Stranger; and did I expo&s;e my&s;elf for no other rea&s;on, but to procure him an Opportunity of declar|ing his Love to you? Was there ever a De&s;tiny more unaccountable? I conjure you, Madam, to cea&s;e tormenting your &s;elf; you have no ju&s;t Cau&s;e to grieve. It is not your Fa|ther's Hou&s;e you regret, neither is it the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> &s;ince your Di&s;dain for him is &s;o great, that you cho&s;e rather to quit the Court, than &s;ee him; but you &s;igh for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> his Ab&s;ence occa&s;ions all the&s;e Tears; what Madam! ought you not to prefer me to him?

If it be true you love me, as you &s;ay you do, u&s;e other means to gain my Favour: Re&s;tore me my Liberty, and let me have the di&s;po&s;ing of my De&s;tiny; you may afterward di&s;pute your Ti|tle to me with the Count, and de&s;erve by your Services that Precedency, which you ap|prehend

I give him. You have one Advantage he has not, which is my being already under &s;ome Obligations to you, and &s;o far I acknow|ledge my Gratitude; therefore I wou'd not have you forfeit the E&s;teem due to &s;o peculiar a Merit; but don't think you &s;hall ever prevail with me, by Force, or by a di&s;re&s;pectful Beha|viour; your pre&s;ent Conduct is a &s;ufficient Motive to render you odious to me; yet upon Condition, you will obey me, I am willing to forget your Offence, and pardon the Ra&s;hne&s;s of a Pa&s;&s;ion, which perhaps you were not Ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>I penetrate into your Thoughts too well, Madam, (reply'd <HI>Benavidez)</HI> to let my &s;elf be deceiv'd by a Di&s;cour&s;e, you wou'd not have made me, had you been at Liberty to declare your Sentiments. The Count has an indi&s;pu|table Advantage over me; he has had the good Fortune to acquire your Favour, but as for my part, you ever look'd on me with all the In|differency imaginable: Your Words bear more Policy, than good Nature, and your Heart &s;peak's for my Rival; be&s;ides, do you think me credulous enough to believe, your Anger can be &s;o ea&s;ily appeas'd. No, I ought not to run the hazard of lo&s;ing a Trea&s;ure, I have already in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Therefore Madam, for my Pa&s;&s;ion's &s;ake, pardon my not complying with your Reque&s;t; re&s;olve to be mine, &s;ince by that means you can render me the happie&s;t of Mankind. I will go with you to any part of the World. You &s;hall be Mi&s;|tre&s;s

of your De&s;tiny and mine; then I will obey you for ever.</P>
<P>Ah! Barbarian, (cry'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> in a mourn|ful Accent) I wou'd &s;ooner &s;acrifice a Thou&s;and Lives, if I had 'em, than con&s;ent to be yours. It is not without rea&s;on, you &s;u&s;pected my Words. I had no other De&s;ign in &s;peaking to you, as I did, but that of retrieving my Liber|ty, and flying you as the cruele&s;t of my Enemies. I &s;ee nothing can deceive a Man who is too great a Ma&s;ter of Di&s;&s;imulation, not to dive into the Thoughts of others. You may ea&s;ily judge, that as my Aver&s;ion for you is infinite, &s;o is my Re&s;entment of the Injury you dome; but you &s;hall not glory long in your Treachery: I had rather ca&s;t my &s;elf into the Arms of Death, tho' never &s;o dreadful, than live with you,; yes, I can find the Way to die, and in dying, meet with too great a Felicity in my de&s;pairing Condition.</P>
<P>Having &s;poke the&s;e Words with much Anger and Emotion, &s;he wou'd not &s;ay any more, nor even look at him, tho' he us'd his utmo&s;t Endeavours to appea&s;e her. This was the de|plorable State &s;he was in, when <HI>Benavidez</HI> em|bark'd with her at <HI>Porto-Real,</HI> in order to &s;ail for <HI>Morocco,</HI> which Pa&s;&s;age was then very danger|ous, becau&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having lately defeated the King of <HI>Tunis</HI>'s Fleet, the <HI>Barbarians</HI> were &s;o enrag'd, that they &s;wore they wou'd be reveng'd, and give no Quarter to any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida</HI> was hardly embark'd, when a hand|&s;ome young Lady came o her in a re&s;pectful

manner; her Features were very regular, and her Countenance &s;o &s;weet and agreeable, that <HI>Leonida,</HI> tho' her Grief was inexpre&s;&s;ible, fix'd her Eyes on her with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure. Her Name was <HI>Inea;</HI> &s;he was Daughter to the Captain of the Ship, and &s;hew'd an extraordi|nary De&s;ire to be &s;erviceable to our Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Fair, in her Affliction. I am extreamly oblig'd to you (&s;aid <HI>Leonida</HI> to her) for the Concern you expre&s;s, but I beg you will give your&s;elf no farther Trouble; The Condition I am in, neither lets me &s;eek, nor wi&s;h for Relief: Oh! leave me to my De&s;pair, &s;ince nothing but Death can ea&s;e me. I have no De&s;ign to di&s;|plea&s;e you, Madam, reply'd <HI>Inea,</HI> but I think my &s;elf under an Obligation to &s;erve you, in all that lies in my power. I can ea&s;ily per|ceive your Trouble is exceeding, and that your Thoughts are entirely imploy'd on &s;ome great Di&s;a&s;ter; but I am per&s;uaded, we ought never to di&s;pair, &s;ince the cruele&s;t Fate may re|ceive a favourable Change. Charming <HI>Inea,</HI> interrupted <HI>Leonida,</HI> (having heard her Name) I am almo&s;t without hopes. We are bound for <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Traytor who has forc'd me away, is carrying me into a Kingdom where he has great Power. Alas, who is it that will come to my help? Neither my Relations, nor Friends know any thing of my Misfortune; no body is acquainted with it, but a Woman, who is even as perfidious as him&s;elf. The&s;e Words made her call to mind <HI>Ca&s;ilda;</HI> and &s;o fatal a Remembrance, occa&s;ion'd her to &s;hed a

rent of Tears. O Traytre&s;s! &s;aid &s;he, (as if &s;he were pre&s;ent) what have I done to you, to de&s;erve this from your Hands? 'Tis you that help'd your Brother to carry me off, and by your wicked Contrivance, I am now come to this Di&s;grace: You have ill rewarded the Af|fection I had for you. I hardly &s;uffer'd the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> to make Profe&s;&s;ions of Love to me, becau&s;e I knew you had a Pa&s;&s;ion for him, and cou'd I have di&s;pos'd of his and my De&s;tiny, I wou'd not have given you the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s. You had no &s;uch generous Senti|ments for me; it was by your means, your Brother knew the Affection I had for this Stranger, and at a time, that you pretended you were not deceiving me; by your fal&s;e Ca|re&s;&s;es, you drew from me all my Secrets, which you have ungratefully abus'd, and on|ly &s;ought my Ruin by &s;uch a Di&s;covery. She pronounc'd the&s;e Words with a Pa&s;&s;ion ju&s;tly in&s;pir'd, and thought by unloading her Mind, &s;he might give &s;ome Ea&s;e to her over-burthen'd Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI> flattering him&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;s|ful Voyage, whenever he &s;poke to <HI>Leonida,</HI> entertain'd her with his Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, he hop'd that as &s;he &s;aw a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to her Fate, &s;he wou'd con&s;ent to make him happy. This Di&s;cour&s;e &s;he heard with Con|tempt, and had &s;o little Regard for his Sighs, Tears and Menaces, that &s;he never turn'd her Eyes on him, but was thinking how &s;he cou'd e&s;cape the Hands of her Ravi&s;her, which &s;he
<PB N="144" REF="148">
wou'd have couragiou&s;ly done by chu&s;ing Death, had not the Sentiments of Religion oppos'd &s;o cruel a Re&s;olution. As <HI>Benavidez</HI> knew his Pre&s;ence was odious to her, he &s;el|dom appear'd; but was in hopes, time wou'd make an Alteration in his Favour, and pro|pos'd, as &s;oon as they were arriv'd at <HI>Morocco,</HI> to find means to make her obey him, if he was not fortunate enough to render him&s;elf agree|able to her.</P>
<P>The Wind being fair, they &s;oon reach'd the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and enter'd the <HI>Mediter|rean,</HI> where having &s;ail'd &s;ome time, the Sea|men &s;houted for Joy in &s;eeing the Coa&s;t of <HI>A|frica,</HI> and did not doubt, but they &s;hou'd make the Land in a few Hours. <HI>Leonida</HI> at this News lamented her unhappy State; &s;he went upon Deck, and ca&s;ting her melancholy Eyes over the va&s;t Ocean; I am looking into the Skies (&s;aid &s;he to <HI>Inea)</HI> to &s;ee whether I can di&s;cover any dark Cloud, or Sign of an ap|proaching Storm; I wi&s;h you were not with me in this Ship, then &s;hou'd I be the more willing to peri&s;h here: But alas! how calm is the Sea, and how &s;erene the Air? We &s;hall &s;oon reach <HI>Africa,</HI> and I have nothing left my wea|ried Soul, but cruel De&s;pair. Her Head was leaning on one of her Hands, and her Neck bathed with Tears that ran from her beauteous Eyes. In this Po&s;ture <HI>Inea</HI> was endeavouring to give her &s;ome Con&s;olation, when &s;uddenly &s;he cry'd, O Heavens here are too great Ships coming up to us under full &s;ail; how unfortunate &s;hou'd we
<PB N="145" REF="149">
be, if they were Enemies? The&s;e Ships be|long'd to the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> and had di&s;cover'd by the Flag of <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Ship, that they were <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which was a &s;ufficient Motive to attack them; War being declar'd at that time between the two Nations; they came up to them, and tho' there was a great Inequality of Force, yet the Captain wou'd not &s;urrender without fighting; <HI>Benavidez</HI> &s;econded him in his Defence with all the Courage imaginable. It di&s;tracted him to think, he was going to lo&s;e a Per&s;on he lov'd more than Life, and lo&s;e her in &s;uch a manner; &s;ince it wou'd either be by his Death, or her Captivity.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;mal Thoughts made him believe, he &s;hou'd have power enough to defend his Mi&s;tre&s;s; you &s;hall &s;ee this Day, Madam, &s;aid he, whether I de&s;erve to be preferr'd to the Count of <HI>La Vagne:</HI> I will &s;acrifice the la&s;t drop of my Blood to deliver you from the Danger, you are threaten'd with; but if I dye, Adorable <HI>Leonida,</HI> remember I dye for you; and that, had not my Pa&s;&s;ion been the Cau&s;e, I wou'd not have committed tho&s;e Crimes, for which I have incurr'd your Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I don't think (&s;aid &s;he, with an Air as full of Pride, as Coldne&s;s) that I am any ways ob|lig'd to thank you for what you are going to act in my Defence. I cannot fall into Hands more barbarous, nor more odious to me, than your's. <HI>Benavidez</HI> had no time to make her an An&s;wer; he can above Deck, and did &s;uch Actions as one wou'd have though incredible, had he
<PB N="146" REF="150">
burn'd with a milder Pa&s;&s;ion; but this brave <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not long able to &s;u&s;tain the over|powering Force of the <HI>Moors:</HI> Tho&s;e that cou'd have &s;econded his Courage, were already wounded; and as he was al&s;o pierc'd with Wounds, he was forc'd at la&s;t to yield, and let his feeble Body take Place among the Enemies, he had ju&s;t &s;acrific'd to his Rage.</P>
<P>The young Prince <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who had ju&s;t fought him, admiring his Courage, did not &s;ee his approaching End, without &s;ome Concern; he commanded that nothing &s;hou'd be neglect|ed to relieve him, and was going to &s;peak to him, when he was inform'd, that &s;everal La|dies were found in the Cabbin. <HI>Leonida</HI> ap|pear'd among them like a Queen in the mid&s;t of her Subjects; he was &s;urpriz'd at her &s;upe|rior Beauty, and tho' Fear was &s;till painted in her Face, and her Eyes had le&s;s Power than u&s;ual, yet her Charms had &s;o great an Influ|ence, that the Prince from a Conqueror became almo&s;t a Captive. <HI>Benavidez</HI> knew her tho' dying, and made an Effort to ri&s;e, and &s;peak to her. You are reveng'd, Madam, &s;aid he, of an unfortunate Man, who never could have been capable of di&s;plea&s;ing you, had not his Pa&s;&s;ion for you been proportionable to his Offence. Don't envy me the Con&s;olation of believing, my Memory will not be odious to you, and that the Lo&s;s of my Life may attone for my Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida,</HI> mov'd at &s;o melancholy a Sight, and her own Condition together, cou'd not re&s;train
<PB N="147" REF="151">
her Tears. I pardon you, <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, the Injury you have done me, and was never cruel enough to wi&s;h your Death; &s;he &s;aid no more, &s;eeing his Eyes were clo&s;ing, and that Palene&s;s had over&s;pread his Face. This new Scene of Misfortunes afflicted her extremely, and gave her Room to fear, the Danger which now threaten'd her was far greater than that &s;he had e&s;cap'd. She &s;aw her&s;elf a Slave to the cruele&s;t Enemies of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and was well inform'd, <HI>Don John</HI> her Father had once been a Terrour to tho&s;e Barbarians, which made her believe, were &s;he known, her Captivity wou'd be the more rigorous.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was fill'd with the&s;e Reflections, young <HI>Abelhamar</HI> look'd on her, rather as a Divinity than a human Creature; and tho' the Admiral commanded in Chief, yet as Prince of the Blood he had all the Deference paid him, that was due to his Quality. He ap|proach'd <HI>Leonida,</HI> whom he addre&s;s'd in a mo&s;t obliging manner, &s;aying, &s;he &s;hou'd have no Rea&s;on to deplore her Fate, and promis'd to u&s;e all his Intere&s;t with the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> to re&s;tore her to her lo&s;t Liberty. He &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> very well, and <HI>Leonida</HI> return'd him Thanks for the Compa&s;&s;ion he &s;hew'd to her Misfortune.</P>
<P>Since the Condition I am in, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, in&s;pires you with Pity, I beg you will let me know my Fate. You &s;hall be obey'd, Madam, reply'd <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> as &s;oon as you go on
<PB N="148" REF="152">
Board the Admiral; for the mi&s;erable Objects, that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to you here, only in|crea&s;e your Melancholy; he then gave her his Hand, and conducted her on Board the other Ship.</P>
<P>All the Women who were taken with <HI>Leoni|da,</HI> follow'd her, in hopes that by her means they might be delivered from the Captivity, which threaten'd them. As &s;oon as &s;he was in the Cabbin, <HI>Abelhamar</HI> &s;poke to her in the&s;e Terms; You &s;eem unea&s;y, Madam, to know your De&s;tiny; were it in my Power, I wou'd &s;oon re&s;ign to you the Di&s;po&s;al of it, and e&s;teem my&s;elf happy in &s;erving you. I am &s;orry my ill Fortune obliges me to comply with the Admiral, who, I mu&s;t inform you, has given Orders for us to return to <HI>Sallee</HI> the Capital of the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> where you will be pre&s;ented to the Sultane&s;s <HI>Celima:</HI> This Prince&s;s is my fir&s;t Cou&s;in; her Father had her brought up in a Ca&s;tle by the Sea|&s;ide, and one Day as &s;he was walking on the Shore, attended only by her Women, &s;ome Cor&s;airs, who were at a Di&s;tance, perceiving her, landed &s;uddenly, and finding &s;he was very hand&s;om, took her and carry'd her to <HI>Bajazet,</HI> who rewarded 'em con&s;iderably for their Pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>This Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> in &s;pight of his natural Haughtine&s;s, became di&s;tractedly in Love with this Prince&s;s, who&s;e Charms were &s;o tran|&s;cendent, that &s;he receiv'd the greate&s;t Marks of Di&s;tinction from the proude&s;t Prince in the
<PB N="149" REF="153">
World. <HI>Celima</HI> made her Father acquainted with her Fate, who, taking Advantage of the Influence &s;he had over the Emperor, prevail'd with him to lend him Men and Money, in or|der to dethrone my Father, who then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Crown by his Birth-Right, and the Laws of the Land; accordingly he not only &s;ucceed|ed in the Enterprize, but even depriv'd him of his Life; and as my Youth cou'd give him no Apprehen&s;ion, he was contented with keeping me confin'd in his Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Bajazet</HI> carried his Arms into <HI>Mi&s;&s;ia,</HI> and took <HI>Celima</HI> with him, who was Witne&s;s of the Advantages he gain'd over the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Hungarians;</HI> but this Prince's Fortune met with a &s;trange Turn; his Army was defeated by <HI>Tamerlane</HI> the Great, and Him&s;elf taken Pri|&s;oner in the Battle. <HI>Celima,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Overthrow, found Means to make her E&s;cape, and return'd to <HI>Sallee,</HI> where her Father re|ceiv'd her with Joy proportionable to her Me|rit; &s;ome Time after, he and his Son dying, the Crown fell to this Prince&s;s, who took effe|ctual Mea&s;ures to &s;ecure it. It was thought at fir&s;t, &s;he had a De&s;ign to marry me, which wou'd have partly made Amends for the Wrongs I had &s;uffer'd from her Family, but &s;he has &s;olemnly declar'd again&s;t Marriage, tho' Young and Hand&s;ome; and the melancho|ly Life &s;he leads, makes People &s;u&s;pect, &s;he is affected with &s;ome deep Concern, which cannot be attributed to the Captivity of <HI>Baja|zet,</HI> &s;ince &s;he has often prote&s;ted, &s;he wou'd
<PB N="150" REF="154">
rather be the La&s;t of his Slaves, than the Fir&s;t of his Favourites; &s;he &s;eldom &s;ees any Compa|ny, but has a great many beautiful Slaves, which are brought to her from all Parts of the World; and as &s;he is extremely unwilling to re&s;tore them to their Liberty when &s;he likes them, I very much fear you will acquire &s;o great a Share in her Favour, that &s;he will not part with you; I wou'd prevent this Misfor|tune were &s;he le&s;s ab&s;olute, but &s;he is &s;o Jea|lous of my Actions, that &s;hou'd I relea&s;e you, it wou'd be &s;ufficient to make her think me Criminal.</P>
<P>Alas, my Lord! interrupted <HI>Leonida,</HI> I am now too well &s;atisfy'd, I &s;hall pa&s;s the re&s;t of my Days in an unhappy Captivity; yet I own, the Danger I have e&s;cap'd from the Power of him that forc'd me away, appear'd to me much more terrible. <HI>Abelhamar</HI> de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd ac|quaint him with her Adventure, which &s;he re|lated with all the Grace imaginable, but con|ceal'd <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Name and her own, telling him, her's was <HI>Felicia</HI> of <HI>Leon,</HI> and &s;o di&s;|guis'd her whole Story after the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida</HI> having entertain'd him &s;ome Hours, he order'd a Repa&s;t to be &s;erv'd, then retir'd, leaving her with <HI>Inea,</HI> who was lamenting the Misfortune &s;he had receiv'd by the Death of the Captain of their Ship, who had been kill'd in the Fight. Oh Father! &s;aid &s;he, Why have I lo&s;t You, or Why did I not die with You? What are become of all my Hopes? They are vani&s;h'd, and the Remainder of my Life will
<PB N="151" REF="155">
be a continu'd Scene of Mi&s;ery. I am now a Slave, and dare not flatter my &s;elf with any Relief from my Relations, who will never ran&s;om me: You were every Thing to me, and your paternal Love was my only Joy. Tho' <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Troubles were great enough, and &s;he not in a Condition to comfort any One, her Natural Genero&s;ity and Tenderne&s;s wou'd not permit her to forget <HI>Inea</HI> on &s;o &s;ad an Occa&s;ion. She approach'd her, and em|bracing her &s;aid, my Dear <HI>Inea,</HI> do not indulge your &s;elf in the&s;e Complaints; you &s;ee I am as unhappy as you are, yet bear my Misfor|tunes with more Re&s;olution. Ah Madam! reply'd <HI>Inea,</HI> you have le&s;s Rea&s;on to complain than I, or more Courage to &s;upport you. As to what regards me, every Thing has contri|buted to load me with Torments! my Father, pierc'd with Wounds, is repre&s;ented to my af|flicted Mind, and by his Lo&s;s, all my agreea|ble Hopes are for ever de&s;troy'd. What have I not done, ye mighty Powers, cried &s;he, to attempt this Voyage? I had at la&s;t compa&s;s'd it, and was flattering my &s;elf with Succe&s;s; but you &s;ee, Madam, how little we mu&s;t depend on Fortune, which binds me with Chains, at a Time that I expected to enjoy a perfect Felicity. In ending the&s;e Words, (which were often interrupted with Sighs) &s;he turn'd her Eyes on <HI>Leonida,</HI> and &s;eeing her Face was bath'd in Tears, did not doubt but her Di&s;|cour&s;e had affected her, which gave &s;ome Ea&s;e to <HI>Inea.</HI> Alas! how generous you are, Ma|dam,
<PB N="152" REF="156">
&s;aid &s;he, to &s;hare my Troubles; I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of your Goodne&s;s, that I wi&s;h nothing more, than an Opportunity of giving you an Evincement of my Gratitude; you have this Day gain'd a Heart, Madam, which &s;hall for ever be at your Devotion. The Compa&s;&s;ion I have for you, <HI>Inea,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Leonida,</HI> you well de&s;erve; and I prote&s;t to you, I &s;hall much le&s;s deplore my Misfortune, if by its Means I acquire your Friend&s;hip. We are Both of us Captives, and as yet unacquainted with our future De&s;tiny; but whatever happens, I hope we &s;hall be together, that we may tell our Pain to each other, which is the only Thing can give Relief to the Unfortunate.</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy Reflections led her into Tho&s;e of a deeper Nature, to which &s;he entirely abandon'd her &s;elf, and continu'd weeping bitterly mo&s;t Part of the Night; then complaining, &s;he cried; Why don't you come, my Dear Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> and deliver me from the Hands of our common Enemies? Oh! how agreeable &s;hou'd I think &s;uch a Change of Fortune; after &s;o con&s;iderable a Service, my Father cou'd not deny giving me to you, and the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> wou'd be overjoy'd at having e&s;cap'd a Marriage, to which he had &s;o great an Aver&s;ion: But alas! (continued &s;he) How far am I from this happy State? My Infelicity is real, and I cannot acquaint you with it. I know not in what Manner the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> may treat me; it's probable you will never hear of me, and Death only will
<PB N="153" REF="157">
terminate my Mi&s;ery. She would have pa&s;s'd the re&s;t of the Night in the&s;e &s;ad Repinings, if <HI>Inea</HI> (who was much troubled for her) had not diverted her Thoughts. Pardon me, Ma|dam, &s;aid &s;he, for interrupting you, and let me intreat you to take a little Repo&s;e: They &s;ay, we are to land to Morrow at <HI>Sallee;</HI> Wou'd you appear before the Queen under &s;o deep a Concern? Our Dependance is on your Perfections, and we believe, her Maje&s;ty will be &s;o plea&s;ed with you, that by her Favour, you may &s;oon contribute to our Liberty: But, Madam, were it only for your own &s;ake, pre|&s;erve tho&s;e Charms, which I fancy have alrea|dy touch'd Prince <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> fine Ladies may expect every Thing from their Beauty.</P>
<P>Oh! <HI>Inea,</HI> What do you tell me? (replied <HI>Leonida,</HI> fetching a deep Sigh,) How different are your Sentiments from mine? The unhap|py Experience I have made of a violent Pa&s;&s;i|on, gives me too ju&s;t a Cau&s;e to fear the like Di&s;a&s;ter; tho' if you con&s;ider well the Figure we &s;hall make in the Court, where we are go|ing, as being <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> we mu&s;t rather expect to be &s;lighted by tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and expos'd to their Cruelty; but there is nothing I wou'd not prefer to the Misfortune of being belov'd by <HI>Abelhamar.</HI> You imagin'd, my Dear <HI>Inea,</HI> that &s;uch a Conque&s;t wou'd flatter my Vanity; yet for my own Satisfaction, I will &s;ooner be|lieve you mi&s;interpreted his Meaning, and thought, what he acted out of Genero&s;ity, pro|ceeded from &s;ome other Motive; however,

&s;ince you de&s;ire it, I will endeavour to take a little Re&s;t; in fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, &s;he em|brac'd <HI>Inea,</HI> and laid her &s;elf on the Bed.</P>
<P>Love had already made a great Progre&s;s in the Heart of <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who was &s;o taken with the Beauty of <HI>Leonida,</HI> (whom we mu&s;t again call <HI>Felicia)</HI> that the Thoughts of lo&s;ing her, when once pre&s;ented to the Queen, gave him much Unea&s;ine&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible (&s;aid he to <HI>Mula,</HI> who was his Favourite,) that I can deliver up this Divine Creature to the Power of my mortal Enemy? Why has Fate order'd, I &s;hou'd be the Author of her Captivity? How &s;hall I, after &s;uch a Conduct, evince her of my Sentiments? Will &s;he not have Room to load me with Reproaches, which mu&s;t be &s;ucceeded by her Aver&s;ion? He was now ruminating on a Thou&s;and different Projects: Fir&s;t, he had no Mind &s;he &s;hou'd land at <HI>Sallee;</HI> then he thought how he might carry her off at his Arrival there; and after all, wou'd thus exa|mine him&s;elf; From whence proceed the&s;e Mo|tions? Sure I am not in Love? have I had Time to conceive a Pa&s;&s;ion for this Fair Stran|ger? No, no, &s;aid he, it is only the Effect of Surprize and Admiration, which will have no farther Con&s;equence, and I &s;hall forget her in cea&s;ing to &s;ee her; yet if &s;he &s;hou'd become dear to me, continued he, I can ask her of the Queen, who, I believe, will not refu&s;e me One Slave out of &s;o great a Number: <HI>Celima,</HI> in making me a Pre&s;ent of this Young Lady, whom I might have kept without her Con&s;ent,
<PB N="155" REF="159">
will think &s;he highly obliges me, and I dare a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf, &s;he will be ready to give me &s;uch a Proof of her Goodne&s;s, at a Time that I have Preten&s;ions to greater Favours.</P>
<P>This Opinion compos'd a little the Agitati|on his Mind was in, but its Calm was not long: Ah, <HI>Mula,</HI> &s;aid he, it is not <HI>Celima</HI> alone can oppo&s;e my Good Fortune; <HI>Felicia</HI> is the Per&s;on who mu&s;t decide my De&s;tiny. Can I flatter my &s;elf, that &s;he is not already en|gag'd? If &s;he has an Inclination for any One in <HI>Spain,</HI> I mu&s;t not expect &s;he will be favour|able to me; I &s;hall appear in her Eyes as a Tyrant, that forces her from the Arms of the Man &s;he loves. <HI>Mula</HI> us'd all Arguments to per&s;wade him into a better Conceit of his Per|&s;onal Merit; but as in Affairs of Love, the lea&s;t Uncertainty is a cruel Torment, he pa&s;s'd that Night betwixt Hope and Fear, without taking any Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t Appearance of Morning, he grew impatient to &s;ee <HI>Felicia,</HI> and hearing &s;he was up, went to her Apartment: She receiv'd him with much Civility, but &s;eem'd extremely de|jected, which griev'd <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who us'd ma|ny tender Words to expre&s;s his Concern. Af|ter a &s;hort Conver&s;ation, &s;he beg'd Leave to go upon Deck; he readily con&s;ented to her Reque&s;t, being de&s;irous to embrace any Op|portunity of obliging her, and immediately order'd it to be &s;pread with a Rich Carpet, and Cu&s;hions of Cloth of Gold, then conduct|ed her to the Place that was prepar'd, and &s;at
<PB N="156" REF="160">
down by her under a Magnificent Canopy. They were &s;ome Time without &s;peaking to one another; for <HI>Felicia</HI> having turn'd her Looks towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> cou'd not forbear melting into a Flood of Tears, which threw <HI>Abelhamar</HI> into &s;o deep a Melancholy, that he had no Power to interrupt her. At la&s;t &s;he recover'd a little from that Exce&s;s of Grief, and broke Silence: The Re&s;pect that is due to you, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, ought to make me conceal my Affliction in your Pre|&s;ence, but your generous Compa&s;&s;ion hinders me from laying &s;o great a Violence on my Spirits; I mu&s;t let my Sorrow take its Cour&s;e, &s;ince it is the only Relief I can expect in my deplorable Condition. Here, forc'd away from my Friends, my Country, and a con&s;iderable Fortune, I am &s;uddenly become Slave to a Queen, who perhaps will not grant me my Li|berty at any Rate. Alas! my Lord, Is there no Means left to deliver me from this Misfor|tune? The Prince, no longer Ma&s;ter of his Pa&s;&s;ion, flung him&s;elf on his Knees, and tak|ing her Hand, Divine Stranger, &s;aid he, judge better of your tran&s;cendent Charms: You are not yet arriv'd at <HI>Sallee,</HI> and 'tis in your Choice not to go there at all: I adore you, amiable <HI>Felicia,</HI> for it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hou'd not in&s;pire &s;omething more than Love: If &s;uch Sentiments merit your Favour, here I lay my Fortune at your Feet; do not di&s;dain the Vows of a Prince, who in Right ought now to be King of <HI>Fez.</HI> Oh, that I had a Crown in my

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I wou'd place it on your Head, if you thought me worthy of wearing it with you; yet I have &s;ome Friends left, and a San|ctuary to go to; Come, Madam, then let us away, &s;o that I po&s;&s;e&s;s you, all my Ambition will be &s;atisfy'd. Ah, my Lord, (&s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> interrupting him,) do not follow the Dictates of an Infant Pa&s;&s;ion, which may cau&s;e you to blu&s;h hereafter; con&s;ider you are &s;peaking to a Chri&s;tian Captive, who has Gratitude and Ge|nero&s;ity enough, not to accept Offers, which might occa&s;ion your Ruin: I am indebted to you, it's true, yet think what I owe to my &s;elf. It wou'd be impo&s;&s;ible for me to con&s;ent to go with you, without being the Author of your Di&s;grace, and my eternal Shame. The Difference of our Laws and Religion, the Ine|quality of our Fortunes, and our little Know|ledge of each Other, all The&s;e oppo&s;e &s;uch a De&s;ign; and &s;hou'd I leave my &s;elf to your Care, you your &s;elf wou'd tax me with the greate&s;t Imprudence. Continue, Madam, (re|plied <HI>Abelhamar</HI> with Impatience,) and rather &s;ay, you love &s;ome Per&s;on in <HI>Spain.</HI> Say, cru|el Creature, you have an Aver&s;ion to me, which is the only Motive of your Con&s;idera|tion. Ah <HI>Felicia!</HI> How ea&s;ily might we over|come all the&s;e Difficulties, were you in&s;pired, like me, with a tender Pa&s;&s;ion? And how lit|tle wou'd you reflect on the Con&s;equences of an Engagement, which flatters us with &s;o per|fect a Felicity? But alas! I &s;ee too well, you prefer the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI>'s Chains to that Li|berty
<PB N="158" REF="162">
I now offer you. Here leaning his Head upon his Hands, he &s;ilently expre&s;s'd his Pain with Sighs that prevented his Utterance: <HI>Fe|licia</HI> continued &s;peaking to him with much Sweetne&s;s and Prudence; but &s;oon forgeting he was near her, &s;he relaps'd into her former Affliction, at the Thoughts of her unhappy De&s;tiny. They were Both in this Situation, when the Admiral (who at a Di&s;tance had ob&s;erv'd them &s;ome Time,) approach'd the Prince, and ask'd him whether he was di&s;pos'd to Eat; Who having recover'd from the little Di&s;order he was in, made An&s;wer, it &s;hou'd be as <HI>Felicia</HI> pleas'd. This beauteous Lady, blu&s;h|ing, &s;aid to him, You do not reflect, my Lord, that I am a Captive here, who alas, has no Command. Ah, Madam! reply'd he, (&s;peaking to her in a low Voice) you know too well the unlimited Power you have, where|ever I am, and no Body feels the Effect of it more than I: If your Empire is &s;o great in Misfortunes, what wou'd it be at another Time? In ending the&s;e Words, they were in|terrupted by the joyful Shouts of the Sea-men, who had ju&s;t di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;ts of the King|dom of <HI>Fez,</HI> which News &s;truck <HI>Felicia</HI> with Con&s;ternation; for whil&s;t &s;he was at Sea, &s;he had &s;ome Hopes, that either a Tempe&s;t wou'd ari&s;e, and ca&s;t them upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> or that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet, which was then A|broad, wou'd retake 'em; but &s;he was too well a&s;&s;ured, that being once landed at <HI>Sallee,</HI> &s;he cou'd not any more expect to be reliev'd.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="163">
<HI>Abelhamar,</HI> on his Side, thought Death le&s;s terrible, than parting with this Young Lady, whom he wou'd &s;oon be oblig'd to yield up to the Sultane&s;s; and as he had not much Time to remain with her, he employ'd tho&s;e Hours in repre&s;enting his Pa&s;&s;ion to her in the &s;ofte&s;t Language, Love and Re&s;pect cou'd in&s;pire; but &s;he receiv'd his Addre&s;&s;es with &s;o much Coldne&s;s, that he began to de&s;pair of meeting with an obliging Return.</P>
<P>They were now arriv'd at <HI>Sallee;</HI> and as <HI>Abelhamar</HI> cou'd not re&s;olve to go him&s;elf, and pre&s;ent <HI>Felicia</HI> to the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> he told the Admiral he was indi&s;pos'd, therefore de&s;i|red he wou'd excu&s;e him to her Maje&s;ty for not waiting on her. He approach'd <HI>Felicia</HI> at the &s;ame Time, and &s;aid, it's you, Madam, that hinders me from making my Court to Day; for I cannot attend you to a Place where you go with &s;o much Reluctancy; but be a&s;|&s;ured, that in Spite of your Indifferency, I &s;hall not omit any Thing to deliver you from your Confinement. You are too generous, my Lord, reply'd &s;he, in endeavouring to con|tribute to my Satisfaction, which will be pur|chas'd very dear, if it &s;hou'd hereafter give you the lea&s;t Chagrin.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> retired exceeding melancholy, and &s;oon after, <HI>Felicia, Inea,</HI> and the Re&s;t of the Slaves, were &s;et on Shore by the Admiral's Command, in order to be &s;ent to the Queen. Alas! my dear <HI>Inea,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> (looking at her with a dejected Air,) we &s;ee our &s;elves

going into Captivity; and, till now, the civil Treatment of <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> prevented us from feeling the full Weight of our Misfortunes: This Prince now leaves us, and the fine Pa|lace we &s;ee, is to be our Pri&s;on. At the&s;e Words, &s;he cou'd not re&s;train the Cour&s;e of her Tears, and <HI>Inea</HI> kept her Company in this di&s;|mal Scene, till they alighted at the fir&s;t Court of the Ca&s;tle, from whence they were imme|diately carry'd to the Queen.</P>
<P>They found her &s;eated on a Carpet of Gold, beautify'd with Diver&s;ity of Colours, and round her were &s;everal embroider'd Cu&s;hions enrich'd with Pearl; &s;he was dre&s;s'd in a <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> Habit of Silver Brocade, Flower'd with Crim&s;on, and Button'd with Diamonds and E|meralds; her Girdle, which was &s;et with Pre|cious Stones, girded a little Poigniard to her Side; Part of her Hair was tuck'd under a Muzlin Veil, &s;trip'd with Gold, and the re&s;t hung in Tre&s;&s;es down her Neck; her Eyes, which were Large and Black, tho' langui&s;hing, &s;hin'd with irre&s;i&s;tible Lu&s;tre; but in her Mein was painted &s;o much Pride and Haughtine&s;s, that it rob'd her of Part of her Charms, and render'd her awful to All that approach'd her.</P>
<P><HI>Leonida</HI> (attended by the Women who were taken with her,) came and flung her &s;elf at the Queen's Feet, who thought her a &s;urpriz|ing Beauty; &s;he cho&s;e her and <HI>Inea</HI> to be of her Chamber, and gave the re&s;t to the Admi|ral to di&s;po&s;e of as he pleas'd. The Queen knew <HI>Leonida</HI> was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> by her Dre&s;s,
<PB N="161" REF="165">
therefore &s;peaking to her in that Language, ask'd her Name, and to what Part of the World &s;he was going when they took her; to which &s;he an&s;wer'd, her Name was <HI>Felicia,</HI> that a Gentleman had run away with her, who told her, he intended to carry her to <HI>Morocco;</HI> but that he had been kill'd in the Engagement, and &s;he thought her &s;elf too happy in her Misfor|tunes, to fall into the Hands of &s;o great a Queen. She fini&s;h'd the&s;e Words with &s;o weak an Accent, that <HI>Celima</HI> ea&s;ily perceiv'd &s;he was under a great Affliction. She extremely pity'd the Youth of this Lady, who&s;e noble Air per|&s;waded her, &s;he was of Eminent Birth. Be un|der no Concern, <HI>Felicia,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, to her; I &s;hall extend my Goodne&s;s to you; there are greater Troubles than tho&s;e you are to under|go in this Palace: You mu&s;t not judge of Fe|licity by Appearances, and I know not, after enquiring into your Condition, and that of &s;ome Sovereigns I have heard of, but your's is more Happy; for, I believe, added &s;he, your Heart has prefer'd its Liberty, being uncom|mon for One at your Age to receive an Im|pre&s;&s;ion of Love. <HI>Leonida</HI> made no Reply, but looking on the Ground, chang'd Colour, and fetch'd a deep Sigh. <HI>Celima,</HI> who only &s;poke to her in this Manner to di&s;cover the Motions of her Heart, ob&s;erving her Di&s;order, perceiv'd &s;he was touch'd with a &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ion, but did not take any farther Notice of it.</P>
<P>A little after, the Governe&s;s of the Slaves or|der'd <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea,</HI> to follow her to that
<PB N="162" REF="166">
Part of the Palace a&s;&s;ign'd for their U&s;e, where &s;he made 'em change their Cloaths; and as they were to wait on the Queen, &s;he gave them very rich Stuffs for their Dre&s;s: They generally went Bare-headed, with their Hair falling negligently on their Shoulders, and as a Mark of Servitude, wore Golden Bracelets, and Chains on their Arms; when they attend|ed the Queen to any Place, they had large White Veils of an extraordinary fine Stuff, which cover'd their Head, and Part of their Face.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia</HI> appear'd as beautiful in this new Ap|parel, as in that &s;he had ju&s;t put off, and her Actions were accompanied with &s;o much Grace, that nothing &s;eem'd &s;trange to her. They car|ried her into a Room, where they were teach|ing the Slaves to &s;ing, and play upon In&s;tru|ments, which &s;urpriz'd her extremely, not ex|pecting to &s;ee &s;o great a Number of Hand&s;om Creatures, as if <HI>Celima</HI> had the Privilege of choo&s;ing them out of all the Courts in the U|niver&s;e. The&s;e Captives &s;how'd no le&s;s Admi|ration in &s;eeing <HI>Felicia;</HI> they all came up to &s;alute her, and among&s;t them, &s;he ob&s;erv'd a young Lady, who&s;e Air was &s;o Maje&s;tick and Charming, that &s;he took a particular Delight in looking at her; but what increas'd her At|tention, was, the Fancy &s;he had to have &s;een her &s;omewhere before, and that &s;he was not unknown to her: They expre&s;s'd an extraor|dinary Civility to each other, and as there is generally a greater Sympathy between unfortu|nate
<PB N="163" REF="167">
Per&s;ons than others, the&s;e Two Fair Cap|tives mutually contracted a particular Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>From thence, <HI>Felicia,</HI> in her new Dre&s;s, was carry'd to the Queen, but made no Stay in her Apartment. Soon after, <HI>Abelhamar</HI> (for|getting he had de&s;ired the Admiral to make his Excu&s;es to <HI>Celima,</HI> for not paying his Court to her that Night,) ran impatiently to the Pa|lace, and &s;eem'd extremely unea&s;y, when he perceiv'd <HI>Felicia</HI> was not with her. He did not pre&s;ume to mention any Thing concerning her, but the Queen &s;aluted him in the&s;e Terms: You have brought me a lovely <HI>Spaniard,</HI> whom you &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently in her Slave's Dre&s;s; I am per&s;waded, you will not think her le&s;s beautiful than before; and I mu&s;t tell you, I have learnt &s;ince your Departure, that &s;he who was taken in the I&s;land of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> is the Daughter of <HI>Brancaleon Doria,</HI> her Name is <HI>O|lympia,</HI> and&mdash;here &s;he is, (continu'd the Queen, &s;eeing her enter the Apartment) &s;he will inform you of &s;omething particularly &s;ur|prizing. <HI>Celima</HI> commanded her to entertain the Prince with her Story, which &s;he obey'd, and <HI>Felicia</HI> coming in at the &s;ame Time, ap|proach'd <HI>Olympia,</HI> who began the en&s;uing Re|lation.</P>
<P>A young Count extremely Hand&s;om, and of a Merit &s;o &s;hining, that he was univer&s;ally admir'd, fell in Love with me; I made him no di&s;obliging Return, thinking my Father wou'd be very well &s;atisfy'd to give me to a Per&s;on
<PB N="164" REF="168">
of his Quality, and one who had highly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd him&s;elf in the World. His Con&s;ent, my Lord, was the only Thing wanting to make us Happy; but alas! we little fore&s;aw the Difficulties that oppos'd our De&s;ires.</P>
<P>My Father di&s;pleas'd with this Nobleman's Family, look'd on him, and all his Relations, as Enemies; however, for a long Time, his politick Rea&s;ons oblig'd him to conceal his true Sentiments, which he di&s;cover'd, when my Marriage was propos'd to him; it was then we knew with mortal Di&s;plea&s;ure, that Time only cou'd relieve us; we both labour'd under all the Vexation, that &s;uch a Di&s;ap|pointment was capable of giving us; and as our Affection daily increas'd, we cou'd not de|ny our &s;elves the Satisfaction of private Inter|views; my Father was acquainted with our Proceedings, which being oppo&s;ite to his In|clinations, made him &s;o angry, that he told me in the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, he wou'd revenge my Di&s;obedience to him on the Object I lov'd. The&s;e Menaces caus'd me to tremble for this young Lord, whom I conjured to ab&s;ent for &s;ome Time, and &s;oon after, a glorious Occa&s;i|on invited him to go Abroad. <HI>Bagazet</HI> had conquer'd a great Part of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the King of <HI>Hungary</HI> endeavouring to beat him our of it, apply'd him&s;elf for Succour to mo&s;t of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> who readily &s;ent him all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho' I con&s;ider'd this to be a long and tedious Journey, and even apprehended all the Dangers the Count might
<PB N="165" REF="169">
be expos'd to, yet through the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Ab&s;ence, I &s;econded the De&s;ire he had of going to <HI>Mi&s;&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>We exchang'd Vows of eternal Con&s;tancy to each other, and the Grief we felt at parting I thought wou'd have co&s;t us our Lives. The Event of the Campaign was very unhappy, the Chri&s;tian Troops were defeated, and the Count taken Pri&s;oner, which News I heard with a Concern, not to be de&s;crib'd; I &s;ent him Money to pay his Ran&s;om, and was ex|pecting his Return with the la&s;t Impatience, when I receiv'd an Account of his Death. It is hard, my Lord, to imagine, how cruelly &s;uch a Lo&s;s affected me. I cou'd no longer re&s;train my Sorrow. I per&s;ecuted my Father with Reproaches, and wou'd not permit either my Relations or Friends to &s;ee me; I thought Life it &s;elf in&s;upportable, and beg'd of Heaven to &s;horten its Date, that I might be eas'd of the Torment I then endur'd.</P>
<P>This was my melancholy Condition, when &s;lumb'ring one Night, my Mind fill'd with my Misfortunes, I &s;uddenly awak'd, and &s;aw a Per&s;on near me, whom at fir&s;t I took for the Shade of my Deceas'd Lover: Such an Appa|rition wou'd have terribly frightened me, had my Pa&s;&s;ion been le&s;s violent. I found after|wards by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that far from being with a Phantom, I had Cau&s;e to believe he was the &s;ame lovely Man, &s;o dear to me. At this Sight, I abandon'd my &s;elf to all the Joy, that cou'd attend &s;uch a Surprize, and &s;hew'd
<PB N="166" REF="170">
to this Cavalier all po&s;&s;ible Marks of Affecti|on; he was cruel enough not to undeceive me, and I was not &s;en&s;ible of my Error till the Day following, when by Chance, my Fa|ther brought him into a Grotto, where I had retir'd to indulge my &s;elf with the plea&s;ing Thoughts of the Count's being re&s;tor'd to Life.</P>
<P>I was then inform'd, this Gentleman, whom I had taken for him, had never &s;een me before, which &s;en&s;ibly touch'd me; I was &s;o a&s;ham'd of this Mi&s;take, that my Affliction had like to have put a Period to my Days. My Father was extremely mov'd at my Condition, and as I knew his Sentiments, I did not doubt but he wou'd oblige me in any Thing I de&s;ir'd; there|fore embracing the Occa&s;ion, I conjured him in mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Terms, to give out that I was Dead, and permit me to go to my Mother, who was then in <HI>Sardignia,</HI> which he readily a&s;&s;ented to. I had not far from <HI>Cagliary</HI> an Aunt, who was Abbe&s;s of a famous Mona&s;try, that lay in a Wilderne&s;s near the Sea-Side, where I intended to end my deplorable Life, conceal'd from the Sight of any Object, that might renew my Sufferings.</P>
<P>My Father, notwith&s;tanding the Chagrin this Separation gave him, di&s;pos'd every Thing for my Departure, and the News of my Death was &s;pread Abroad, without any One's thinking it &s;uppos'd. I immediately left <HI>Genoa,</HI> and my Voyage had nothing Remarkable in it; for I &s;oon arriv'd in <HI>Sardignia,</HI> where my Mother receiv'd me, and without Deliberation
<PB N="167" REF="171">
con&s;ented to what I &s;o much wi&s;h'd. She car|ry'd me to her Si&s;ter, who was the Depo&s;itory of my Secrets, and having chang'd my Name, I led a Life &s;o retir'd, that without being of the Number of the Dead, I cou'd not be reckon'd among&s;t the Living; but I us'd often to be a|larm'd with Letters from my Father, pre&s;&s;ing me to quit my Solitude in order to return Home, which made me apprehend, he wou'd u&s;e his Authority to compel me to it; there|fore I went and flung my &s;elf at my Aunt's Feet, and conjured her to give me the Nun's Veil; that having once made Vows, my Rela|tions might lo&s;e the Hopes of my returning a|gain into the World.</P>
<P>She at fir&s;t oppos'd my Reque&s;t, believing &s;he ought not to make &s;uch a Step, without the Advice of my Friends; but at la&s;t my Pray|ers and Tears prevail'd on her. She de&s;ir'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cagliary</HI> to perform the Ceremo|ny; and as it is the Cu&s;tom in that Place, for the Per&s;on who takes the Habit of a Novice, to go with a Number of young Ladies, to hear the Prelate in a little Chappel by the Sea-Side, I went out dre&s;s'd in a long Gown, Bro|caded with Silver, my Hair hanging loo&s;e on my Shoulders, and my Head crown'd with Flowers; my Companions were al&s;o dre&s;s'd in White, and in this Manner we form'd a Pro|ce&s;&s;ion along the Shore.</P>
<P>It's now, &s;aid I, my Dear Count, that I am going to &s;acrifice to you the re&s;t of an unhap|py Life, which was de&s;tin'd to be your's.
<PB N="168" REF="172">
Were you &s;en&s;ible in the Region where you are, of what I do for you in this World, you wou'd rejoyce to have in&s;pir'd me with &s;uch Sentiments. I was lo&s;t in the&s;e Thoughts, when I heard a great Noi&s;e; the Cries of my Companions oblig'd me to look behind me, where I &s;aw &s;everal Men following us with their Swords drawn. I endeavour'd to make my E&s;cape, but two of them being come up to me, carry'd me off, with &s;ome of the young Ladies; and having forc'd us into a Boat, row'd imme|diately up to their Ship, where we were under Sail before any one cou'd come to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>One may ea&s;ily imagine, that &s;uch a Sur|prize terrified us extremely; but it was no|thing to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief which &s;eiz'd us, when we found our &s;elves in the Hands of a <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> of <HI>Algier,</HI> neither our Prayers nor Tears had Power to &s;often him; all his Thoughts were fix'd on making the mo&s;t of our Captivi|ty. He &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of <HI>Sardignia,</HI> and after having taken other Prizes, &s;teer'd his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Sallee,</HI> being &s;ure to &s;ell &s;ome of us to the Queen, who was pleas'd to chu&s;e me (as you know, my Lord,) out of a Motive of Pity; for I was &s;o very melancholy, that none cou'd &s;ee me without Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It never came into my Head to acquaint my Father with my Captivity, nor did I wi&s;h the Recovery of my Liberty, which I was going to offer as a Sacrifice, when the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> took me. It was equal to me, to be &s;hut up in the Palace of <HI>Sallee,</HI> or in a Mona&s;try; &s;ince I had
<PB N="169" REF="173">
no other De&s;ire, than that of leaving the World, and pa&s;&s;ing the Remainder of an unfortunate Life without any Engagement.</P>
<P>In this State, were my Affairs, and I daily receiving new Favours from the Queen, when a Merchant of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who deals in Jewels, came to this Court. Her Maje&s;ty being de&s;irous to &s;ee what valuable Things he had to di&s;po&s;e of, &s;ent for him, and I was near her, when he enter'd the Apart|ment. He no &s;ooner ca&s;t his Eyes on me, but &s;eem'd a&s;toni&s;h'd; for he did not doubt of my being Dead, as it was reported; yet in &s;eeing me, he had Cau&s;e enough to believe, I was <HI>Brancaleon Doria</HI>'s Daughter; &s;ince he had &s;poken to me too often at my Father's Hou&s;e, not to know me again; and as he immediately perceiv'd I knew him, it &s;o confirm'd his O|pinion, that he de&s;ir'd Leave to &s;peak with me, which he obtain'd of the Queen. Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam, you &s;hou'd thus neglect Writing to your Friends, who &s;o infinitely love you, and are lamenting your Death at <HI>Genoa,</HI> whil&s;t you are Living, and a Slave at <HI>Sallee?</HI> Who bemoans me? (&s;aid I, with a melancho|ly Accent:) Do you believe, that after the fa|tal De&s;tiny of a Per&s;on, who was dearer to me than Life, I cou'd find any Reli&s;h for the World? No, as my Pa&s;&s;ion was great, &s;o was my Sorrow; and no other Motive induc'd me to &s;pread Abroad my pretended Death, only to retire into &s;ome Solitude, and there forever regret the Lo&s;s of a Man I &s;o dearly lov'd. In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, I bur&s;t out in Tears,

and the Jeweller fixing his Eyes on me with Ad|miration; you de&s;erve a better Fate, Madam, &s;aid he, and I e&s;teem my &s;elf happy, to have met with this Opportunity of a&s;&s;uring you, the Gentleman you actually deplore, did not peri&s;h as it was related; he arriv'd at <HI>Genoa</HI> a little after the Report of your Death, at which he was &s;o touch'd, that his Trouble is not to be de&s;crib'd; he admitted me to &s;ee him often, but his Grief wou'd &s;eldom allow him to &s;peak, and whenever he broke Silence, it was with your Name; he afterwards fell dan|gerou&s;ly ill, and as &s;oon as he recover'd, went to Travel; but he is now return'd to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and I can give you Te&s;timonies, Madam, of his eternal Love.</P>
<P>We were in a Place pretty di&s;tant from the Queen, who cou'd not hear our Conver&s;ation; but I was &s;o tran&s;ported at this News, that (without knowing what I did, or con&s;idering why,) I ran and flung my &s;elf at her Feet; at fir&s;t I was not able to &s;peak, my Eyes gu&s;h'd out with Tears, and I look'd at her in &s;o mov|ing a manner, that &s;he ask'd me &s;everal times what was my Reque&s;t? The Merchant being a Man of Sen&s;e, came up, and explain'd the Meaning of my Di&s;order; and as I had time to recover my &s;elf during their Di&s;cour&s;e; Ah Madam! &s;aid I to the Queen, I entreat your Maje&s;ty to give me my Liberty; I am now wil|ling to live, and wi&s;h my &s;elf at <HI>Genoa,</HI> &s;ince my Misfortunes are at an end. No Creature was more wretched than I, and now, none is more happy. I prote&s;t to you, Madam, I daily &s;aw

the Light with Pain, having as I thought, lo&s;t the only Per&s;on that cou'd make my Felicity, and de&s;ir'd Death to terminate my Mi&s;eries, as it had done his. I cannot call to mind all I &s;aid to the Queen, who was pleas'd to hear me with a great deal of Conde&s;cen&s;ion; and being inform'd who I was, as a particular Proof of her E&s;teem for my Family, &s;he re&s;tor'd me to my Liberty, for which I return'd her Maje&s;ty repeated Thanks. I ask'd the Jeweller a great many Que&s;tions, and de&s;ir'd he wou'd procure me Conveniencies for my Pa&s;&s;age in the next Ship that &s;hou'd &s;ale for <HI>Genoa;</HI> but after hav|ing made more &s;erious Reflections, I thought it prudent, not to put my &s;elf into my Fa|ther's Power, till I had fir&s;t con&s;ulted the Count, and taken Mea&s;ures with him to &s;uc|ceed in our mutual De&s;ires, without running any Ri&s;que of meeting with new Ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I wrote to him by the &s;ame Merchant, who is return'd to <HI>Ge|noa,</HI> in order to bring him here: This is, my Lord, what has pa&s;s'd during your Ab&s;ence, which the Queen commanded me to relate to you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Story of</HI> Inea.</HEAD>
<P>I Am born of a noble Family of <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> where my Father had a good E&s;tate, and marry'd a Lady, who brought him no Fortune; he was ever thought a gallant Man, and being bred up to the Sea from his Infancy, the King gave him a Ship of War; he has left two Daughters, my elde&s;t Si&s;ter's Name is <HI>Ma|thilda,</HI> who is very hand&s;om. We us'd to &s;ee but little Company, according to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Spain;</HI> but my Father having receiv'd into his Hou&s;e a young Gentleman of a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Family in <HI>Toledo,</HI> who&s;e Name is Don <HI>Ramire</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> a &s;ecret Sympathy di&s;pos'd his Heart and mine, to receive Impre&s;&s;ions for each other. I was pleas'd at his gentle Air, his Wit, and
<PB N="174" REF="178">
&s;oft in&s;inuating manner, which engaged me un|awares; and we were not long acquainted, before he declar'd, I had in&s;pir'd him with the tendere&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He thought him&s;elf happy in wearing my Chains. His Fortune and Merit gave him &s;uch Advantages, that he had no room to appre|hend any of my Friends wou'd oppo&s;e his Fe|licity, and I was of the &s;ame Opinion; for tho' I re&s;i&s;ted the Infant Inclination I had for him, it proceeded only from the fear I had of its not being &s;incerely return'd. How unfor|tunate &s;hou'd I be, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, were my Affection plac'd on a Man, who might receive it with Indifference? I ought, before it's too late, re&s;olve to fly, and deny my Eyes the Plea&s;ure they take in &s;eeing him. The ju&s;t Diffidence I had of my own Merit, oblig'd me to be very re&s;erv'd to Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> and be|have my &s;elf in a manner quite oppo&s;ite to my Sentiments, which inclin'd him to believe, I had conceiv'd an Aver&s;ion for him; this Thought did not only afflict him, but made him &s;o timerous, that he had not Power to &s;peak to me. I examin'd all his Actions with great Care, and when we were together, he appear'd extremely pen&s;ive; I attributed this to the weak Impre&s;&s;ion I had made on him, which created in me much Unea&s;ine&s;s, and I did the greate&s;t Violence to my &s;elf in not &s;howing my Concern; but tho' our Minds were prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, yet our Eyes, meeting &s;ome|times, cou'd not help confe&s;&s;ing the inward
<PB N="175" REF="179">
Motion of our Hearts. Ah! too indifferent Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> thought I, if you are really touch'd, in what manner wou'd your Looks expre&s;s it, &s;ince without being &s;o, they &s;peak the &s;oft Language of Love? He told me after|wards, he had conceiv'd the &s;ame Idea of me, and di&s;cover'd in my Eyes &s;omething which wou'd have flatter'd him, had I not given him too many In&s;tances of my In&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>My Si&s;ter pa&s;s'd &s;ome time in &s;tudying our Looks, and was endeavouring to know whe|ther we had a Pa&s;&s;ion for each other, having her &s;elf a &s;ecret rea&s;on to be inform'd of the Truth; all the Care &s;he took, &s;erv'd only to per&s;wade her, there was no Love between us, and that &s;he might undertake what &s;he pleas'd without Apprehen&s;ion. Don <HI>Ramire</HI> appear'd as agreeable in her Eyes, as he did in mine; but the Difference of his Proceedings with her was very remarkable: It came into his Head, fir&s;t to acquire her Friend&s;hip, that afterwards he might make her his Confident, and &s;o by degrees, engage her in his Intere&s;t. Thus one may &s;ee, how blind is Love, in &s;ome of his Projects; for there was very little Probability, that <HI>Mathilda</HI> wou'd act in &s;uch a Character. She was my Mother's Favourite, as my elde&s;t Sis&s;ter had a Right to be married before me; therefore (Don <HI>Ramire</HI> being the only Per&s;on who then &s;eem'd de&s;irous to make an Alliance with our Family) it was thought but ju&s;t, &s;he &s;hou'd have the Precedency.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="180">
I was not long, before I di&s;cover'd her In|tentions, and my Unea&s;ine&s;s met with &s;o va&s;t an Addition, that it had like to have thrown me into De&s;pair. What (&s;aid I, complaining of my Fate) am I already jealous? I who can hardly tell what it is to love, and mu&s;t I feel a thou&s;and different Pains, which ought to be unknown to one of my Age? Methinks, I cou'd approve his Pa&s;&s;ion, were he di&s;pos'd to like me; yet I have avoided him with the &s;ame Caution, I wou'd have done the Man I hate; was ever Conduct like mine? My Si&s;ter is taking Advantage of my Timidity; &s;he is be|lov'd, and in &s;pite of that, I &s;till harbour &s;uch Sentiments as ought to make me blu&s;h, &s;ince they will render me the unhappie&s;t Creature in the World.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> who&s;e Perplexity of Mind was not inferior to mine, cou'd no longer be &s;ilent; and as <HI>Mathilda</HI> gave him all Opportunities of entertaining her, one Evening as they were walking together in one Ally of the Garden, and I in another, (unknown to them, and at too great a Di&s;tance to hear what they were &s;ay|ing) I perceiv'd he was talking to her with a great deal of Emotion; at la&s;t I &s;aw him fling him&s;elf at her Feet, and taking her Hand, ki&s;s'd it &s;o ardently, that I no ways doubted but he had ju&s;t declar'd his Pa&s;&s;ion to her; which meeting with an obliging Reception, occa&s;ion'd tho&s;e Tran&s;ports in him. Oh Hea|vens! what a Sight was this to a Per&s;on in my Condition? I wou'd no longer ob&s;erve
<PB N="177" REF="181">
them, but went into an Arbour at the end of the Ally, not having Strength enough to &s;up|port me, nor Power to re&s;i&s;t the Cour&s;e of my Grief.</P>
<P>There I threw my &s;elf on the Ground, lean|ing my Head on a Bench, and covering my Face with my Veil, I &s;hed a Shower of Tears. Oh! how cruel is my De&s;tiny, &s;aid I? Don <HI>Ramire</HI> and <HI>Mathilda</HI> love each other; &s;he has heard his Declaration, and given him a favourable Audience, for which, he made his Retributi|ons to her on his Knees, and I can never flat|ter my &s;elf with the Hopes of being dear to him. Here my Sighs and Tears made me per|fectly a&s;ham'd, and I was as mad at my own Sen&s;ibility, as at his Indifferency; but had I known what was pa&s;&s;ing between him and my Si&s;ter, I &s;hou'd have had as much rea&s;on to be pleas'd, as I thought I had for the con|trary.</P>
<P>In fine, Madam, after a Conver&s;ation that turn'd on different Subjects, Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> urg|ed by the Violence of his Pain, deliver'd his Thoughts to her in the following Manner: Charming <HI>Mathilda!</HI> I mu&s;t intru&s;t you with a Secret, on which depends the Peace of my Life; be pleas'd to hear me, and let me find in you tho&s;e generous Di&s;po&s;itions, that may contribute to my future Happine&s;s. As &s;he believed he was going to di&s;clo&s;e a Secret to her, wherein &s;he was chiefly concern'd, &s;he thought fit to keep him under &s;uch a Re&s;tri|ction, as not to allow him too much Liberty.
<PB N="178" REF="182">
You ought, Sir, an&s;wer'd &s;he, to di&s;cover your Pain to a Per&s;on of more Wit than me; I have not Experience enough to give you any Advice, and there are certain Things I do not de&s;ire to know. Be a&s;&s;ur'd, Madam, interrupt|ed he, I have too great a Re&s;pect for you, to &s;ay any thing that could give you the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure; moreover, you have nothing to fear, &s;ince you are not intere&s;ted in this Affair. I am only going to tell you, I have a Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Inea,</HI> whom I adore; I hope my Succe&s;s from your good Offices, and conjure you to grant me your Favour in this Reque&s;t. In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, he flung him&s;elf at her Feet, and his Thoughts were &s;o entirely taken up with what he was &s;aying, that he took no notice of the different Emotions, which ap|pear'd in her Looks. All, that Rage, Shame, and exce&s;&s;ive Love cou'd make one feel, join'd at once, to torment her. You love my Si&s;ter, (&s;aid &s;he, after being &s;ome time &s;ilent,) and you chu&s;e me for your Confident, without con&s;idering, that as I am the elde&s;t, my For|tune mu&s;t be &s;ettled, before hers: I am &s;o of|fended at the Injury you do me, that were I more revengeful than I am, I wou'd in&s;tantly puni&s;h your Indifferency. Go, Sir, continu'd &s;he, &s;peak to her your &s;elf; I &s;hou'd render you but a very ill Office; with that &s;he left him, and no Man was ever &s;een in a greater Confu&s;ion. He walk'd &s;ome time in the Ally, reflecting on what had pa&s;s'd, and was now convinc'd, <HI>Mathilda,</HI> having di&s;cover'd her
<PB N="179" REF="183">
Weakne&s;s to him, wou'd leave no Art unpra|ctis'd to di&s;appoint his Pa&s;&s;ion for me.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> perplex'd with the&s;e Thoughts, came into the Arbour, where I told you, Ma|dam, I had retir'd, and was not a little &s;ur|priz'd to find me there. As for my Part, I knew not what Re&s;olution to take, whether to go, or &s;tay, when he put him&s;elf on his Knees by me, and intreating me to hear him, Adorable <HI>Inea,</HI> &s;aid he, the Condition I am reduc'd to, does not permit me to be any longer &s;ilent. I cannot doubt of your Aver|&s;ion, &s;ince you not only debar me of your Conver&s;ation, but even turn your Eyes from me. I have us'd all po&s;&s;ible Means to decline a Pa&s;&s;ion, which I fear will di&s;plea&s;e you: But as the Torment I endure is little inferior to Death, whatever U&s;age I am to receive from you hereafter, only think, I daily die for you.</P>
<P>I cou'd not imagine, Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> (reply'd I) you were &s;o capable of Deceit, but your Conduct convinces me of the Truth. You try in vain to per&s;wade me. This Di&s;&s;imulation is wor&s;e than the Offence, and I know what I am to depend on. Go, Sir, I am re&s;olv'd ne|ver to &s;ee you, nor &s;peak to you more. End|ing the&s;e Words, I ran from him, in &s;pight of his Endeavours to prevent me, and left him with an Air, &s;o full of Pride and Anger, that he told me &s;ince, he had like to have expired on the Place. His De&s;pair was &s;o great, that (being retired to his Chamber) he was taken ill with a violent Feaver, which oblig'd him to keep his Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="184">
The mean while I went into my Clo&s;er, where being alone, I abandon'd my &s;elf to a thou&s;and cruel Reflections. Were I only to contend with <HI>Mathilda,</HI> thought I, there wou'd &s;till be hopes of obtaining &s;ome Advan|tage over her; but the Ca&s;e now is &s;uch, that &s;hou'd Don <HI>Ramire</HI> yield his Heart to me, me|thinks I wou'd reject the Offer. He is a Tray|tor, who tells me, he has Sentiments for me, which he has not. He &s;ays the &s;ame to my Si&s;ter, and loves neither of us; at lea&s;t I have cau&s;e to complain, &s;ince he chu&s;es me for the Subject of his Raillery. Oh! what Fatality deludes me, to love this perfidious Man? I fear he knows the Affection I have for him, which is a Misfortune, I cannot bear. The&s;e Thoughts forc'd a Flood of Tears from my Eyes, whil&s;t I endeavour'd to bani&s;h him from my Heart; and I was thus depre&s;s'd with Sor|row, when my Mother &s;ent for me: I went down to her Apartment, and appear'd &s;o de|jected, that my Si&s;ter (who examin'd every Motion of me) did not doubt, but I was come from Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Chamber, and that his Ill|ne&s;s was the Occa&s;ion of my Melancholy; tho' at the &s;ame time, I knew nothing of the Matter, nor wou'd I enquire after him, think|ing he did not de&s;erve &s;o great a Favour, there|fore I return'd to my own Chamber again, without hearing his Name once mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Mathilda</HI> per&s;i&s;ting in her Love for Don <HI>Ra|mire,</HI> told my Mother the Conver&s;ation they had together in the Garden, and de&s;ir'd, &s;he
<PB N="181" REF="185">
wou'd be favourable to her, in laying her Com|mands on me, to u&s;e him with &s;o much Indif|ference, as might de&s;troy his Hopes of ever attaining to my Affection. This, my Mother promis'd her, and all &s;he cou'd wi&s;h on that Subject. The next Day, I heard the Conditi|on he was in, who little thought, I had the lea&s;t Concern for his Illne&s;s, tho' I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, it gave me much Unea&s;ine&s;s, and Com|pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon took place of my Anger; yet I wou'd not go to &s;ee him, whatever Pain I &s;uf|fer'd, in denying my &s;elf that Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Ah! how great is my Misfortune, cry'd I, not to have Pride enough to &s;uppre&s;s a Pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;o immoderately di&s;turbs my Mind, and yet have &s;o much Re&s;entment, as to deny my &s;elf the only Plea&s;ure this World can give me? How is it po&s;&s;ible, I can be &s;o cruel to a Per|&s;on, who&s;e Idea is never ab&s;ent from me, and who&s;e Life I wou'd purcha&s;e with my own?</P>
<P>By this time, his Feaver was &s;o violent, that the Phy&s;icians were of Opinion, nothing but his Youth cou'd &s;ave him. I was in my Mo|ther's Apartment, when they came to acquaint her with the Danger he was in, &s;aying, they believ'd him very near leaving the World. At this News, I was &s;o &s;eiz'd with Grief, that all I cou'd do, was to reach my Chamber, where I fell in a Swoon, and continu'd &s;o almo&s;t an Hour.</P>
<P>I had with me a young Servant, called <HI>Te|reza,</HI> who lov'd me entirely; and as &s;he was no Stranger to my Affection for Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> &s;he
<PB N="182" REF="186">
help'd me to conceal the De&s;pair I was in. No, cry'd I, (when I was a little recover'd,) I can|not let him die, &s;pite of his Ingratitude: I find the Pre&s;ervation of my Life depends on his. Heavens, (continu'd I, bath'd in Tears) &s;hor|ten my Days, and give Health to Don <HI>Ra|mire;</HI> for alas, without him, what can I ex|pect, but unconceivable Pain? I prote&s;t to you, Madam, I &s;aid a thou&s;and di&s;tracted Things, the Recital of which, wou'd tire you; for &s;ure, no Sorrow was ever equal to mine. I was thus tormenting my &s;elf, when my Mo|ther came into my Chamber, and her Pre&s;ence &s;o &s;urpriz'd me, that I had like to have relat|ed to her the Subject of my Grief.

Oh! con&s;ider what a Sacrifice I make you, when I own tho&s;e Sentiments, I have &s;o long endeavour'd to conceal. I thought you had an Inclination for my Si&s;ter, which gave me much Unea&s;ine&s;s; all your Civilities to her, I us'd to attribute to Love; and what very much increas'd my Torment, was the Action you did &s;ome Days ago, when you flung your &s;elf on your Knees before her in the Garden.

We us'd every Day to vi&s;it <HI>Don Ramire,</HI> du|ring his Illne&s;s, and whenever I was alone with <HI>Mathilda;</HI> I con&s;train'd my &s;elf to exag|gerate the Affection he had for her, which I really repeated &s;o often, that &s;ometimes I was afraid I &s;poke the Truth.

About this Time, the Governour of <HI>Porto Real,</HI> (who&s;e Daughter had been newly marry'd) gave an Entertainment, with a Ball at Night, to all the Nobility of that Place.

Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> who was to be of the Party, expre&s;s'd &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s at my going thither, fearing my Charms, as he told me, wou'd create him many Rivals.

Lady with one Hand, and carries a Torch in the other. My Si&s;ter, as &s;he was dancing, found it ea&s;y enough to take his Tablets away, unknown to him. The Dance being ended, &s;he went a&s;ide, in order to examine them. You may ea&s;ily judge, at reading what was wrote in 'em, how enrag'd &s;he was, to find her &s;elf thus betray'd, and the Preference given to me; having &s;o good an Opinion of her own Merit, as to believe, it wou'd have in&s;ured her from this Misfortune.</P>
<P>Nothing cou'd be equal to the violent Pa&s;&s;i|on &s;he was in; yet during the Ball, &s;he en|deavour'd to conceal it; and what help'd her mo&s;t to di&s;&s;emble, was, that (to do her Ju|&s;tice) as &s;he is very amiable, Don <HI>Sanche</HI> of <HI>Gu&s;man,</HI> Son to the Governour, who was a fine Gentleman, but extremely vain, addre&s;s'd him&s;elf particularly to her, and &s;he thought, &s;he cou'd not have a better Opportunity to cure her Pa&s;&s;ion, and be reveng'd of Don <HI>Ra|mire,</HI> than giving a favourable Reception to this Cavalier; therefore, &s;he immediately gave him to under&s;tand, my Mother wou'd be will|ing he &s;hou'd vi&s;it us: Altho' we are not fond of Company, &s;aid &s;he, yet, Sir, your di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd Birth and Merit intitle you to a Pri|vilege, others cannot pretend to. This Invi|tation highly pleas'd him, ina&s;much as he had already declar'd his Pa&s;&s;ion for my Si&s;ter, and cou'd not well expect a Return, unle&s;s he were admitted to pay his Devoirs to her.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="193">
<HI>Mathilda</HI> prepar'd my Mother to receive him, but did not mention the Adventure of the Tablets; &s;he only told her, that as &s;he was not very &s;ure of Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Heart, a Rival might give him &s;ome Jealou&s;y, and in|duce him to conclude a Marriage, he daily &s;eem'd to decline. While &s;he was &s;tudying Means to &s;atisfy her Revenge, Don <HI>Ramire</HI> acquainted me with the Lo&s;s of his Tablets, which he fear'd were fallen into the Hands of my Si&s;ter: Tho' I take little Notice of her Behaviour towards me, &s;aid he, I ob&s;erve within the&s;e few Days, &s;he treats me with an affected Civility. I cannot well penetrate into the Cau&s;e, nor &s;hou'd be any ways unea&s;y a|bout it, only I apprehend, &s;he is inform'd of what we had agreed &s;hou'd be kept &s;ecret: If you will give me Leave, continu'd he, to declare my Pa&s;&s;ion to your Father, we &s;hall &s;oon know what to depend on.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Madam, the only Motive I had to make a My&s;tery of it, was the Plea|&s;ure of being &s;ecretly belov'd by a Man, whom I e&s;teem'd &s;o worthy my Affection; therefore I de&s;ired he would &s;tay &s;ome Time longer, before he di&s;covered his Sentiments.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> &s;aid I, that our Condition is not &s;o unhappy, as you imagine. We live together in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and in Spite of the jealous Eyes, which continually ob&s;erve us, we &s;ee one another every Day, and our Love is mutual.</P>

Such as the&s;e were our daily Conver&s;ati|ons, when we perceiv'd by Don <HI>Sanche</HI>'s a&s;&s;idu|ous Court&s;hip to my Si&s;ter, that his Pa&s;&s;ion for her had receiv'd a new Addition.

<P>Alas, Madam! you may imagine, the&s;e ob|liging A&s;&s;urances from a Man, I &s;o entirely loved, made the Days pa&s;s like Hours; but will you believe, that while we were expect|ing the Conclu&s;ion of my Si&s;ter's Marriage with Don <HI>Sanche,</HI> her Jealou&s;y increas'd to &s;uch a Degree, that it wou'd not give her a Moment's Peace.

Before I &s;aw you, I was not a|ver&s;ed to him; but alas, I cannot now think of my Fate, without Horror. I do not doubt, but your Love and Courage united will re|lea&s;e me from this Engagement, &s;ince nothing, except my Inclination for you, cou'd induce me to decline it. Here her malicious Tears interrupted her Di&s;cour&s;e, and by this Strata|gem, Don <HI>Sanche</HI> was ea&s;ily per&s;waded to un|dertake any de&s;perate Thing again&s;t Don <HI>Ra|mire.</HI> He a&s;&s;ured her, he wou'd &s;oon make him renounce his Preten&s;ions to her, if he had A&s;&s;urance enough to oppo&s;e him in a Place, where his Authority was great, and in an Af|fair, where his Heart was &s;o particularly con|cern'd; adding to the&s;e Words, all that: Love cou'd in&s;pire.</P>
<P>This made <HI>Mathilda</HI> believe, Don <HI>Ramire</HI> wou'd rather yield her up, than engage in her Quarrel, or that if he an&s;wer'd the Challenge, out of a Point of Honour, he wou'd have a potent Enemy to contend with. She mu&s;t

As Don <HI>Ramire</HI> believ'd, &s;o violent a Begin|ning wou'd have a &s;uitable Con&s;equence, he went the next Day to a Place, where he thought he might meet him, (as he effectually did.) Don <HI>Sanche</HI> no &s;ooner perceiv'd him, but came up, and &s;aid in a low Voice, with|out the lea&s;t Affectation; Well, Sir, are you di&s;pos'd to mea&s;ure your Sword with mine?

Alas! I am per&s;waded, that fatal Charm was my &s;elf.

Guards, &s;urrounded my Father's Hou&s;e, and &s;natch'd him from my Arms, in Spite of all I cou'd do to oppo&s;e 'em.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Moments I cannot call to mind, with|out the greate&s;t Concern. The Governour, who was perfectly di&s;tracted, as well as in|con&s;olable for the Lo&s;s of his only Son, came him&s;elf, on purpo&s;e to &s;acrifice Don <HI>Ramire</HI> to his Re&s;entment. I do not at all doubt, but as he was &s;econded by a &s;trong Guard, he wou'd have kill'd my Lover before my Face, had not I prevented him by &s;tanding between 'em, and to &s;ave him, expos'd my &s;elf to all the Danger; for tho' I am naturally &s;o time|rous, that even the Sight of a drawn Sword &s;trikes me with Terror, yet I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma|dam, on that Occa&s;ion, I behav'd my &s;elf with &s;o much Re&s;olution, that I am convinc'd, to be Brave, it is &s;ufficient to be in Love.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> who &s;aw with the utmo&s;t De|&s;pair, the Danger which threatened me, was like a Lyon, defending him&s;elf again&s;t a Com|pany of eager Hunt&s;men; he wounded &s;ome, and avoided the Fury of others; but alas, his Courage, and the little A&s;&s;i&s;tance I cou'd af|ford him, did not hinder them from &s;eizing, and carrying him immediately to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>I thought at that Time, my Soul wou'd have departed from its Habitation, my Blood turn'd &s;o cold in my Veins. I would have fol|low'd Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> and &s;har'd his Misfortunes, had not my Mother and Si&s;ter prevented me. <HI>Mathilda,</HI> more like a Fury, than a rea&s;onable

I was then inform'd, he had been examined, and the partial Judgment of the Court had already condemn'd him, the Governour being re&s;olv'd, not to &s;how him the lea&s;t Favour; but as there was a Form to be ob&s;erved in the Tryal, they had permitted an Acquaintance of his, who&s;e Name was Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> to plead in Defence of his Life.</P>
<P>Far from &s;inking under this Misfortune, I receiv'd new Strength from its Extremity: It is no Time now to &s;hed Tears, cry'd I; the Safety of my Lover, is what I mu&s;t think on. <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> continued I, you were ever faithful to me, and are the only Per&s;on, in whom I can confide; go, run, and buy me a Suit of Mens Cloaths, for I am re&s;olv'd to &s;ee Don <HI>Ramire:</HI> I can pretend I am Son to Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> who

<P>Night being come, I ordered <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> to take the Key of my Chamber, and give out I was ill in Bed; then went out in this Di&s;gui&s;e, protected by none but my Guardian Angels.

<P>When I was arriv'd at this fatal Pri&s;on, I hardly had Strength to &s;upport me; my Spi|rits were feeble, and I found my &s;elf in much

Di&s;order. The fir&s;t Per&s;on I &s;poke to, was the Jaylor's Daughter; I told her, I was Don <HI>Ti|ello</HI>'s Son, Friend to Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> and was come to inform him of the State of his Affairs. At the&s;e Words, &s;he pre&s;s'd my Hand, like a Per&s;on in &s;ome Concern, and &s;aid, Ah, Sir, the unhappy Gentleman is lo&s;t, if you do not take &s;peedy Mea&s;ures to &s;ave him. I know more of that Matter than you, continued &s;he, and perhaps intere&s;t my &s;elf as much. The Place we were in, was &s;o dark, that I cou'd not &s;ee her Face, tho' I had a great Curio&s;ity to know the Per&s;on who expre&s;s'd her &s;elf &s;o feelingly; but I &s;aid in a trembling Voice, pray tell me, what you have heard concerning him. All the Judges, reply'd &s;he, are devoted to the Governour, and Don <HI>Ramire</HI> will be condemn'd without Appeal; I have endeavoured in vain to find an Opportunity of &s;peaking to to him, but never cou'd &s;ee him, &s;ince he was brought here, cover'd with Blood and Du&s;t; and in that di&s;mal Condition, he appear'd to me the hand&s;ome&s;t Man, I had ever &s;een. Alas, how fatal was that Sight to me? I was &s;o touch'd with his Misfortune, that all my Thoughts e|ver &s;ince have been employ'd on his Safety, and I am happy enough to have found an Ex|pedient, which cannot fail.</P>
<P>Here &s;he was &s;ilent, but after a little Pau&s;e, a&s;&s;um'd her Di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;ince you are his Friend, continued &s;he, I ought not to conceal from you, the Di&s;po&s;ition I have for him; I

mu&s;t confe&s;s I love him, and my Affection is rais'd to &s;uch a Degree, that I am re&s;olv'd to deliver him from hence, if in giving him his Life, he will dedicate the Remainder of it to me, and render my Fate in&s;eparable from his. Tell him, how near the Danger is, &s;ince he will not have common Mercy &s;hown him, and that if he can purcha&s;e his Life on the&s;e Terms, I am ready to &s;erve him: I know he is a Man of Quality, and the va&s;t Di&s;proportion there is between us; but the Condition, I hope, will make me acceptable to him: I &s;hall for his &s;ake, expo&s;e my Family to the Governour's Re&s;entment, who will believe my Father contriv'd his E&s;|cape, and perhaps, puni&s;h him accordingly. How often have I &s;aid to my &s;elf, <HI>Laurea!</HI> unfortunate <HI>Laurea!</HI> cea&s;e attempting a Happi|ne&s;s that meets with &s;uch Difficulties. What! has my Pa&s;&s;ion for a Stranger, Power enough to make me for&s;ake my Parents? Alas, Sir, I have di&s;puted with my &s;elf, till I am no long|er Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Rea&s;on; I cou'd &s;acrifice every thing for him; he is dearer to me than Life, and the Danger he is in, affects me be|yond Imagination. A&s;&s;ure him from me, that my Heart never receiv'd an Impre&s;&s;ion before. I am young, and tho' not beautiful, may pa&s;s for agreeable. Oh! how happy &s;hou'd I think my &s;elf, if he did but like me? And cou'd his Pa&s;&s;ion proceed more from Inclination than Gra|titude, I &s;hou'd die tran&s;ported: Yet, &s;aid &s;he to me, as you are particularly acquainted with him, pray tell me, whether he is not already

<P>Tho' my Heart was &s;o contracted with Grief, that I cou'd hardly an&s;wer her, after &s;he had ceas'd &s;peaking, I &s;aid to her, Ma|dam, your De&s;ign in pre&s;erving a Gentleman, &s;o de&s;erving of Life, is truly generous. I am per&s;waded, he will not be ungrateful, and &s;hall let you know his Sentiments, when I re|turn. She left me immediately to tell her Fa|ther, I was Don <HI>Tiello</HI>'s Son, who de&s;ired to &s;ee Don <HI>Ramire.</HI> He made no Difficulty, but conducted me to the Place, where this unhap|py Gentleman was &s;hut up: Alas, Madam, where &s;hall I find Words to expre&s;s the An|gui&s;h and Trouble I felt at that In&s;tant? What am I going to do, and what Advice &s;hall I give him? &s;aid I. Mu&s;t I deliver him up to my Rival? No, I cannot bear the Thought of it.

Oh! &s;ure, I cannot be guilty of &s;o much Cruelty, for ra|ther than let him die, he &s;hall be hers: I will with my own Hand give him to her, and &s;ince I am de&s;tin'd to be a Sacrifice, my Peace and Liberty &s;hall be the Ran&s;om of his Pre&s;erva|tion.</P>

Thus, Madam, I came to the Chamber where Don <HI>Ramire</HI> was confin'd, and being let in, the Doors were &s;hut again. He was &s;o ex|tremely thoughtful, that he hardly turn'd his Eyes towards me, till I &s;poke to him; What makes you &s;o di&s;pirited, Sir? &s;aid I: Where is that Courage, which ever &s;upported you? The Tone of my Voice, made me known to him, and opening his Arms; Oh, my Angel! cry'd he, the only dear Object of my Vows; Is it you I &s;ee here, in this frightful Pri&s;on? Are you come to &s;hare my Pains? At the&s;e Words, he took hold of my Hand, and ki&s;s'd it with Tran&s;ports of the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion. I &s;at down by him, and was &s;ome Time, before I cou'd recover my Speech, &s;o many di&s;mal Thoughts con&s;pir'd to increa&s;e my De&s;pair; at la&s;t, I made an Effort, and &s;aid, if you knew, my dear Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> what is contriving again&s;t you, my Pre&s;ence wou'd not give you all this Joy.

left: I had rather deplore the Lo&s;s of your Heart, than that of your Life. O fatal Re|&s;olution! added I, mu&s;t I even lo&s;e the Hopes of ever being yours? But alas, what do I &s;ay? It is no time now to reflect. I cannot ballance your Intere&s;t with mine. You mu&s;t live, Sir, tho' you live for another: Whil&s;t unhappy <HI>I|nea,</HI> (retired to &s;ome remote &s;olitary Place) will be dead to you, and to the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ramire</HI> heard me with Surprize, and made me this Reply; Do you think, Madam, I &s;hall not always prefer Death to an inglori|ous Life, and that I am capable of making you the Sacrifice? No, unfortunate as I am, Love and Re&s;olution are my Companions, and nothing &s;hall ever make me change.

&s;hall we do then? cry'd I: Your tender Scru|ples, are very ill timed; Do you con&s;ider, how near you are the Danger, which threat|ens you, and that your Fate is almo&s;t inevita|ble? I beg of you, I conjure you to comply with <HI>Laurea,</HI> tho' you are dearer to me than Life.

<P>A Deluge of Tears follow'd the&s;e Words, and my Spirits were &s;o faint, that I cou'd hard|ly continue my Di&s;cour&s;e. Ah! how fatal will your Pity be to me, cry'd he? Your Trouble pierces my Heart. Don't be &s;o dejected, charming <HI>Inea,</HI> Heaven will take care of us.

No, &s;aid I, do not &s;u&s;pect his Honour, nor mine, you &s;hall never have rea&s;on to repent your generous Sentiments, but when will you &s;et him free?

<P>By this time I was come home, where I found <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> waiting for me.

Her Affection to my Service &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd me, that I embrac'd her, and promis'd never to for&s;ake her. You mu&s;t go out with me to Morrow Night, continu'd I, di&s;guis'd in Men's Cloaths, for fear my Relations (perceiving my Flight, and the Lo&s;s of the Jewels) &s;hou'd &s;eize you; as Don <HI>Tiello</HI> is a Man of Honour, and in our Pri&s;oner's Intere&s;t, I will meet him be|fore I go to the Pri&s;on, and tell him my Re&s;o|lution of &s;taying in Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Place; I &s;hall de&s;ire him at the &s;ame to protect you, and procure us a Ship to follow him.

I know not, Madam, how it was po&s;&s;ible, I cou'd bear with the Anxiety of my Thoughts; all that was di&s;mal, and full of Terror, enter'd my Imagination, whil&s;t I was uncertain of his Fate; but by the time I thought he might be out of Danger, my af|flicted Mind receiv'd &s;ome Relief.</P>
<P>As I had pa&s;s'd but a very indifferent Night, I lay all the next Day on the Bed, which made the Jaylor believe I was &s;ick; therefore when|ever he came into my Chamber, he wou'd not

interrupt me, but leaving what was nece&s;&s;ary by me, retired. I continued in this Situation, till the Evening, when I was agreeably &s;ur|priz'd with a Vi&s;it from Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> who brought me a Letter, and inform'd me of Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s being happily embark'd; he highly commended the Re&s;olution I had &s;hown, in &s;taying in his Place, with the hazard of my Life, to pre&s;erve his; but after he had been &s;ome time with me, he di&s;cover'd, I was not what I appear'd to be; the Tone of my Voice, my Complexion, and particularly the Emotion I was in, when I &s;poke of Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> with the Joy I expre&s;s'd at receiving his Letter, and my Tears, every thing confirm'd his Su&s;pici|ons; yet for fear of offending me, he wou'd not mention any thing of the Matter; pro|te&s;ting only, he wou'd do all, that depended on him to &s;erve me, and that I cou'd not con|fide in a Per&s;on, who wou'd make a more gene|rous return. After &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es of this Na|ture, he took Leave of me, wi&s;hing I might meet a Recompence, proportionable to &s;o great and perfect a Friend&s;hip. I pa&s;s'd the re&s;t of my Night in reading over, and over, Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Letter, which was the only Con&s;olation I had, the five Days I was Pri&s;o|ner; it was writ in the&s;e Terms,</P>

of my Father, who will be pro&s;ecuted for his E&s;cape: I &s;hall be the occa&s;ion of the Ruin of my Family, and how do I know, but I may be lo&s;t with them. It's true, I am pro|mis'd every thing from Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> yet my Birth is &s;o inferior to his, that nothing le&s;s than an extraordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, cou'd induce him to conde&s;cend to our Alliance; be&s;ides, he has never &s;een me; and when we are once embark'd together, in&s;tead of loving me, per|haps he may hate me.

I will bring Don <HI>Ramire</HI> to you; every thing is ready for his E&s;cape, and you may take Mea&s;ures for our Departure. <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> extream|ly overjoy'd at the&s;e Words, left her immediate|ly, and went to Don <HI>Tiello</HI> to tell him, Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Friend, whom he had &s;een in Pri&s;on, wou'd be that Night &s;et free, and de&s;ired, he wou'd prepare a Sloop for their go|ing off; but, continu'd &s;he, how &s;hall we di&s;|engage our &s;elves from <HI>Laurea,</HI> who will do us all the Prejudice in her Power, if once &s;he per|ceives we have betray'd her. When &s;he comes aboard, &s;aid he, and finds it is not Don <HI>Ra|mire</HI>'s Concern, &s;he will be too happy to return home, without di&s;covering any thing, for fear they &s;hou'd charge her with having an Hand in his E&s;cape; and if &s;ome unfore&s;een Accident does not happen, I am per&s;uaded, we &s;hall ma|nage this Affair to our Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As I cou'd not tell, what Hour <HI>Laurea</HI> had appointed to &s;et me at Liberty, I began to be very much tired with my Confinement; but in the dead of Night, I was reliev'd of my Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, when I heard my Door open &s;oftly, and &s;aw the Jaylor's Daughter; being wrap'd in my Cloak, I advanc'd towards her, with my Face almo&s;t hid, for fear &s;he &s;hou'd di&s;co|ver I was not Don <HI>Ramire:</HI> I embrac'd her with the greate&s;t Marks of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, but &s;aid little to her on the Score of my Gra|titude; &s;he was in &s;uch Di&s;order her &s;elf, that I believe it wou'd have been hard for her, to perceive the Deceit, had &s;he even &s;een my

Face. In one Hand &s;he had a dark Lanthorn, and in the other a Bunch of Keys, &s;o without &s;aying any thing to me, &s;he made me a Sign to follow her, which I did, and we pa&s;s'd all the Soldiers who were fa&s;t a&s;leep, as &s;he had contriv'd it, by putting Opium in their Wine. Thus we left the Place without the lea&s;t Ob|&s;tacle; but as &s;oon as we were in the Street, &s;he took hold of my Arm, as if &s;he were afraid I &s;hou'd fly her, cling'd to me &s;o clo&s;e, that I was hardly able to walk.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> and <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> were waiting for me in the Place they had appointed, from whence, we went together to the Sea-&s;ide, where we found the Boat belonging to the Ship, which was to carry me to <HI>Morocco.</HI> The Night was very dark, and <HI>Laurea</HI> made me a thou|&s;and Care&s;&s;es, I cou'd but very ill return, being in pain to know, what wou'd become of this young Creature, after &s;he had di&s;cover'd the Plot. We were not long a making up to the Ve&s;&s;el, and as &s;oon as we came on board, Don <HI>Tiello</HI> carry'd us into the Captain's Cabbin; but, Madam, how &s;hall I tell you the Surprize I was in, when I found this Captain to be my Father, who was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;h'd to &s;ee <HI>Te|re&s;a</HI> and me, after all the Enquiry that had been made about us throughout the whole City. Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> knowing he profe&s;s'd a great Friend&s;hip for Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> had tru&s;ted him with the Secret, and declar'd, I was that unhappy Gentleman's Mi&s;tre&s;s, who had re&s;olv'd to follow his Fortune into <HI>Morocco,</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="220">
in Man's Di&s;gui&s;e; he &s;tarted back three or four Steps, and not being Ma&s;ter of the fir&s;t Effects of his Pa&s;&s;ion, was going to draw his Sword, when I flung my &s;elf at his Feet: Oh Sir! &s;aid I, forgive me; remember you are my Father, and vouch&s;afe to hear, before you puni&s;h me. I embrac'd his Knees, and wet his Hand with my Tears. Tho' he entirely lov'd me, yet in this Occa&s;ion, he &s;how'd his Re|&s;entment, by making me many Reproaches, and at la&s;t, bid me &s;ay what I cou'd, to ju&s;ti|fy my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I knew my only Remedy was, to confe&s;s the Truth, which I did in &s;o feeling a Man|ner, that it mov'd his Compa&s;&s;ion. He was very well acquainted with Don <HI>Ramire</HI>'s Me|rit, and had been thoroughly concern'd for his Impri&s;onment; but being inform'd of his E&s;cape, he expre&s;s'd an entire Satisfaction. My Father left us to go into another Cabbin with Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> who was very much his Friend. I &s;ee, &s;aid he, you are &s;urpriz'd, as well as me, at what has happened; you were certainly a Stranger to <HI>Inea</HI>'s Flight, and did not think, it was her you had put into my Hands. I prote&s;t to you, reply'd Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> I am under a Con&s;ternation, which I cannot expre&s;s. I can't &s;ay I have committed a Fault; for perhaps, it may turn to Advantage, that the Affair has pa&s;s'd after this Manner; but if you will make me perfectly ea&s;y, I beg you will grant me your Daughter's Pardon, whate|ver Rea&s;ons you have to be di&s;pleas'd with

her. You &s;ee, &s;he is contracted to Don <HI>Ra|mire,</HI> who is a Man of Birth and Fortune, and in my Opinion, you cannot di&s;po&s;e of her bet|ter, than uniting her De&s;tiny to his. I agree with you, reply'd my Father; but his Pro|ceedings to obtain <HI>Inea,</HI> without my Con&s;ent, highly offend me. I receiv'd him into my Hou&s;e as a particular Friend, and wou'd have willingly given my elde&s;t Daughter to him; was it nor a very ill Return, he made to &s;o much Civility, when he engag'd this young Creature to di&s;gui&s;e her &s;elf, and follow him like a Madwoman? If you remember what <HI>I|nea</HI> has related to us, reply'd Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> &s;he is alone culpable; yet of all Crimes, tho&s;e which Love makes us commit, are mo&s;t excu&s;eable, and e&s;pecially in a young Per&s;on, who has &s;o little Experience. Forgive her then, I conjure you, added he, and you will confer an Obliga|tion on me, which I &s;hall ever acknowledge. My Father, who was already di&s;pos'd to fa|vour me, embracing Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> &s;aid to him, I am con&s;iderably indebted to you, for enter|ing &s;o generou&s;ly into the Intere&s;t of my Fa|mily, and will forget <HI>Inea</HI>'s Crime, &s;ince you de&s;ire it; if Don <HI>Ramire</HI> has a real Pa&s;&s;ion for her, I &s;hall rejoice at the Match; and as a Proof of my Satisfaction, I will carry her to <HI>Morrocco,</HI> in order to compleat their Happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This Conver&s;ation ended in my Favour, as you &s;ee, Madam, which I little expected; for I was in the Cabbin &s;o extremely afflicted,
<PB N="218" REF="222">
that I may &s;ay, no Sorrow cou'd be equal to mine. What will become of me, (&s;aid I to <HI>Tere&s;a)</HI> I am for ever unfortunate? I loo&s;e my Liberty, in the very Moment, I thought my &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of my De&s;tiny, and I am now in the Power of a Father, who will have no Mercy of me. Alas! poor Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> I mu&s;t never &s;ee him more; he will certainly think I am Dead, or Incon&s;tant, and either of the Two will drive him into De&s;pair; I &s;hall be deliver'd up to my Mother and Si&s;ter's Se|verities, which is a Misfortune, I can never endure.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was &s;peaking, <HI>Laurea</HI> look'd at me with the Eyes of a Fury: Don't you de&s;erve the Fate you have met with, &s;aid &s;he? Nay, even more than what &s;eems to threaten you. You have deceived me, perfidious as you are, and improv'd my Weakne&s;s in Favour of your Lover. I have ju&s;t delivered up my Family to the Governour's Re&s;entment, but don't think to e&s;cape me; you &s;hall be my Victim, as I am your's. In pronouncing the&s;e Words, &s;he flung her &s;elf upon me, and I do not doubt, but wou'd have &s;tifled me, had not <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> come to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as well as my Father and Don <HI>Tiello,</HI> who hearing a Noi&s;e, ran, and freed me from this mad Creature's Rage; I &s;tood in want of their Help, for I did not re&s;i&s;t her, prefering Death to an unhappy Life.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Tiello</HI> &s;aw very well, to what a Condi|tion my Grief had reduc'd me, and neglected nothing to ea&s;e my troubled Mind; he beg'd
<PB N="219" REF="223">
I wou'd no longer afflict my &s;elf. I have pre|vail'd with your Father, Madam, &s;aid he, and he has promis'd me to carry you to <HI>Morocco.</HI> I had not patience to hear any more, but up|on the&s;e A&s;&s;urances, went and flung my &s;elf at my Father's Feet, and embracing his Knees, expre&s;s'd my Gratitude; he told me with a great deal of Goodne&s;s, that, as it was Don <HI>Tiello</HI>'s Reque&s;t, he forgave me, and con&s;ent|ed I &s;hou'd marry Don <HI>Ramire.</HI> At the&s;e Words <HI>Laurea</HI> cry'd aloud, and made &s;uch Complaints, as wou'd move any one with Pity; I knew by my &s;elf what &s;he &s;uffered. Alas! (&s;aid I, to <HI>Tere&s;a)</HI> were my Ca&s;e like hers, how wretched &s;hou'd I be? She loves Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> and was flatter'd with the Hopes of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;t of her Days with him, but now tho&s;e agreeable Thoughts are all de&s;troy'd. She loves him le&s;s than you imagine, reply'd <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> and if I had not done my utmo&s;t to make her pur&s;ue her fir&s;t Intentions, I very much doubt the Per|formance of what &s;he promis'd you. Here, <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> related to us what had pa&s;s'd between them, as I have already inform'd you, Ma|dam; and Don <HI>Tiello</HI> told <HI>Laurea,</HI> the be&s;t Thing &s;he cou'd do, was to return to <HI>Porto-Real</HI> before Day, that her Father might not know of her having a Hand in the Matter; &s;o he took his Leave of us, and carrying her with him into the Boat, they both went a|&s;hore.</P>

Alas, my Dear, &s;aid &s;he, I my &s;elf am very unfortunate, and did you know the cruel Torments I endure, you wou'd own, you are not alone to be pitied; but I con&s;ider, it's Time for you to retire; I have kept you up too long.

You do me Inju&s;tice, replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> if you have &s;o di&s;|obliging a Thought; I am extremely plea&s;ed with your Compliance; and to convince you thereof, I will to Morrow, in Return, confide

the Secrets of my Life to you. In fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, &s;he embrac'd her again, and <HI>I|nea</HI> went to her Bed.</P>

Oh, how my Soul is alarm'd!

Alas, &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> they wou'd make no Impre&s;&s;ion on me at any other Time; but what have I not to fear at pre|&s;ent, being far from my Country, and from a Friend, who&s;e Ab&s;ence is the chief Cau&s;e of my Unea&s;ine&s;s? Tho' I own to you, <HI>Abelha|mar</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion for me, is no &s;mall Addition to my Woes, &s;ince I mu&s;t be continually on my Guard again&s;t the Pur&s;uits of a Prince, who has &s;o much Power in this Court. Unhappy Creature that I am! Were not my Misfortunes great enough? Why mu&s;t the few Charms I have left, &s;erve only to render them the more in&s;upportable? Don't add to your Affliction, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Inea,</HI> the Prince has too much Re&s;pect for you, to u&s;e his Authority in Op|po&s;ition to your Inclinations, and you may

ea&s;ily imagine, as &s;oon as your Relations are inform'd of your De&s;tiny, they will employ all their Intere&s;t to relieve you. I &s;hou'd be in the Wrong to doubt their Affection for me, reply'd <HI>Felicia</HI> weeping, tho' in their Opinion, my Behaviour merits no Favour. Oh! that I rather owed my Liberty to the Man, who&s;e Pre&s;ence now wou'd make me happy. I find you are in Love, Madam, (&s;aid <HI>Inea,</HI> inter|rupting her.)

<P><HI>Felicia</HI> began immediately to relate her Story, from the time her Father had contracted her to the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> but her Di&s;cour&s;e was often interrupted with Tears, which the Thoughts of her Misfortunes extorted from her; I am not only concern'd, &s;aid &s;he, at my being &s;eparated from the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> but incon&s;olable, when I think, how <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> betray'd me, after having cho&s;e her for my Friend, and lov'd her &s;incerely.

<P>They were talking in this manner, when the Governe&s;s of the Slaves came, and bid 'em dre&s;s them&s;elves, in order to wait on the Queen to the <HI>Mo&s;quez,</HI> where they were oblig'd to attend, tho' Chri&s;tians. <HI>Felicia,</HI> during the Ceremony of tho&s;e Infidels, took &s;uch care to hide &s;elf in her Veil, that altho' <HI>Abelhamar</HI>

I am inform'd of his Senti|ments, and know part of your's; but it's to be fear'd, that a young Creature as you are, (having no other Engagement, and being flat|ter'd with the Hopes he gives you) might &s;a|crifice your Virtues to your Ambition; yet I cannot believe, you wou'd con&s;ent to be his Mi&s;tre&s;s; for that is all you mu&s;t expect from a Man, who certainly never will Marry you. I do not know, Madam, an&s;wer'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> (with a great deal of Mode&s;ty) who cou'd &s;peak to you of the Prince's Sentiments; but if your Maje&s;ty is inform'd of mine, you are convinc'd I have receiv'd his Offers in &s;uch a Manner, as ought to de&s;troy all the Hopes, my Mis|fortunes might have given him; the Conditi|on I am in, Madam, continu'd &s;he, has not
<PB N="225" REF="229">
made any di&s;honourable Impre&s;&s;ion on my Heart, and I ble&s;s Heaven, to find your Ma|je&s;ty &s;o oppos'd to a Thing, which I cou'd not think on, without the greate&s;t Horror; for in my Opinion, it is more glorious to die, than live a Life de&s;titute of Virtue.</P>
<P>What! &s;aid the Queen, wou'd you &s;ooner chu&s;e Death, than be Mi&s;tre&s;s to <HI>Abelhamar?</HI> Who wou'd not, as well as I, Madam, (repli|ed <HI>Felicia,)</HI> and what other Thought cou'd en|ter into one's Head? This Re&s;olution is my only Comfort, &s;ince I know it to be an effe|ctual Way to deliver me from an infamous Pa&s;&s;ion. But if you have a Lover in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;aid the Queen, do you con&s;ider, that in dy|ing at <HI>Sallee,</HI> you never will &s;ee him more? Suppo&s;e there were any One, for whom I had an Inclination, replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> I &s;hou'd be the more ready to die, as being the &s;tronge&s;t E|vincement I cou'd give him of my Con&s;tancy; for if it were my Misfortune, not to live for him, I never wou'd for any other. Ha, <HI>Feli|cia!</HI> &s;aid the Queen, &s;miling, What do you tell me; is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>Cupid</HI> hath already &s;ummon'd a Heart &s;o young? But alas, there is no Age free from his Empire; in one Moment the fatal Dart is lanc'd. Ending the&s;e Words, &s;he &s;igh'd, and remain'd &s;ome Time in a deep Silence.</P>
<P>All the Ladies who attended the Queen, were &s;tanding at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from the Place where &s;he was &s;ate, that &s;he cou'd &s;peak to <HI>Felicia</HI> without being heard; here, &s;aid &s;he, (taking
<PB N="226" REF="230">
the Prince's Letter from her Bo&s;om,) &s;ee what <HI>Abelhamar</HI> has wrote to you. I believe you are virtuous, therefore cannot &s;u&s;pect your Conduct: When you &s;ee him, take no Notice of my knowing his Sentiments; but advi&s;e him, not to per&s;evere in his De&s;ign; for in|&s;tead of procuring your Liberty, as he promi|&s;es, perhaps he may lo&s;e his own for the re&s;t of his Days. This &s;he pronounc'd with a me|lancholy Accent, then ro&s;e, and return'd to the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia,</HI> overjoy'd at what the Queen had &s;aid to her, join'd <HI>Inea,</HI> whom &s;he de&s;ired to &s;tay with her in the Garden, and they both went, and &s;ate down in the &s;ame Place, which <HI>Celima</HI> had ju&s;t quitted. Notwith&s;tanding all the Misfortunes that afflict me, (&s;aid <HI>Felicia</HI> to her Companion) I have Cau&s;e to ble&s;s Hea|ven, for the Di&s;po&s;ition the Queen is in; &s;he forbids me receiving the Prince's Addre&s;&s;es; think, my Dear, how willing I am to obey her, and whether &s;he had Need to u&s;e her Au|thority on this Occa&s;ion. I congratulate you, an&s;wer'd <HI>Inea,</HI> &s;ince it adds to your Comfort, but I cannot conceive out of what Motive &s;he oppo&s;es a Thing, which ought to be indiffe|rent to her, unle&s;s &s;he has her &s;elf taken an Affection for him. I am apt to believe, &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> her Thoughts are employ'd on &s;ome Object, and that her Heart is not entirely free from Love; for when &s;he ask'd me, whether I had any Engagement, I perceiv'd &s;he grew of a &s;udden &s;o pen&s;ive, that it was &s;ome Time
<PB N="227" REF="231">
before &s;he cou'd recover her &s;elf; yet I cannot think &s;he likes the young Prince, for as &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of her De&s;tiny, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he might make him her Husband if it were her Plea|&s;ure; I rather believe, &s;he intends to keep him under an ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion to her Will. Can &s;he be &s;o little acquainted with the Moti|ons of a Heart, interrupted <HI>Inea,</HI> to imagine <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Sentiments will receive Laws from a Sovereign, whom he has &s;ome Rea&s;on to hate? As for my part, I know it wou'd be impo&s;&s;ible for me, either to Love, or not Love, by Command; I might &s;o far prevail with my &s;elf, as to be &s;ilent, or to counterfeit an Indifference, and yet I cannot tell, whether I &s;hou'd act that Part &s;o well, as to plea&s;e tho&s;e who wou'd lay &s;uch a Duty on me. I &s;hall not di&s;pute with you on that Subject, re|plied <HI>Felicia;</HI> but between us, I e&s;teem it a great Happine&s;s, that my Inclination is &s;o ready to comply with the Queen's Com|mands.</P>
<P>As &s;he had fini&s;hed her Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he per|ceiv'd a Man near her, whom by the Light of the Moon, &s;he knew to be <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> which not a little &s;urpriz'd her; &s;he ro&s;e in order to run from him, but he took hold of her, and &s;aid, Do not fly me thus, cruel <HI>Feli|cia;</HI> I am unfortunate enough, to have heard your Conver&s;ation with <HI>Celima,</HI> and cou'd wi&s;h my &s;elf dead, rather than give you the Di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me once more at your Feet. Here he was &s;ilent, but after &s;ome Time,
<PB N="228" REF="232">
continu'd in this Manner; What! did I think One, whom I look'd on a Divinity, wou'd ap|prove of the unju&s;t Queen's Barbarity, and re|duce me to the la&s;t De&s;pair, by an inhumane U&s;age? Take Care, ungrateful <HI>Felicia,</HI> how you behave your &s;elf towards me. I am not here among Strangers, and <HI>Celima</HI> (who wou'd fain di&s;po&s;e of my Heart, as &s;he does of my Crown) may find, Fortune is not always con|&s;tant, and that U&s;urpers have ever Cau&s;e to fear. My Lord, replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> I perceive you heard what the Queen &s;aid, relating to you; I mu&s;t not concern my &s;elf in Affairs of State, and &s;ince you know my Sentiments, I &s;hall make no Diffiulty in confe&s;&s;ing them. It is true, I was &s;en&s;ibly pleas'd to receive a Command &s;o po&s;itive, and conformable to my Inclination, for I cannot love an Enemy to my Country and Religion. Why have I treated you like an Enemy? an&s;wer'd the Prince: What Advantage did I take of my Victory? Was it a Crime to love, and &s;erve you? I am &s;en&s;ible of all you acted for me, interrupted <HI>Felicia,</HI> and my Gratitude is equal to your Favours; accept of it then, my Lord, as the only Return I can make, and it's even more than the Queen will con&s;ent to.</P>
<P>The Prince falling into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, lean'd him&s;elf again&s;t a Balli&s;ter of Marble Pil|lars, which boarded the Terrace-Walk, and looking at <HI>Felicia,</HI> with De&s;pair in his Coun|tenance; I &s;wear, &s;aid he, by our great <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> and by my Love, that if I don't enjoy
<PB N="229" REF="233">
you, I will put the Kingdom of <HI>Fez</HI> into De|&s;olation, pull down from the Throne the un|worthy Prince&s;s who &s;its on it, and burn this magnificent Palace to A&s;hes. You &s;hall &s;ee, <HI>Felicia,</HI> what &s;uch a Lover as I can do, when he finds him&s;elf de&s;pis'd. Your Eyes &s;hall cau&s;e more Confu&s;ion among&s;t us, than any Revo|lution ever did. Oh Heavens, my Lord! cry'd <HI>Felicia;</HI> can any thing be more dreadful, than &s;uch De&s;igns? What! for an unfortunate Slave, as I am, wou'd you di&s;turb the Peace of this Nation? Are not my Woes great e|nough already; mu&s;t you attempt to force me away from the Queen, after I have declar'd to you, that I will re&s;olve on Death, &s;ooner than con&s;ent to your De&s;ires? My Lord, &s;ince I mu&s;t confe&s;s it, I am in Love with One in <HI>Spain,</HI> and I will as willingly give my Life, as marry any other; Ab&s;ence it &s;elf &s;hall ne|ver le&s;&s;en my Affection for him: I know the Way to be con&s;tant, and pre&s;erve my Heart for One, who&mdash;No, I can hear you no longer, (&s;aid the Prince, interrupting her) you endeavour to di&s;tract me, with the cruel|e&s;t Things, you can imagine; but in Time, I will be reveng'd on you, the Queen, and that dangerous Rival. Fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, he left <HI>Felicia.</HI></P>
<P>Her Affliction was &s;o great, that &s;he had hardly reach'd the Palace, when &s;he was &s;eiz|ed with a violent Feaver, which continu'd all that Night. The Governe&s;s of the Slaves went next Morning, to acquaint the Queen of
<PB N="230" REF="234">
it, who &s;ent <HI>Olympia Doria</HI> to &s;tay by her. As &s;oon as <HI>Felicia</HI> &s;aw her enter the Chamber, &s;he &s;aid to her, with a langui&s;hing Air; The Condition I am in, Madam, will only give you Unea&s;ine&s;s, and the Company of &s;o un|fortunate a Creature as I, can be no ways a|greeable to you. I cannot tell, whether it be a Plea&s;ure to you, to &s;ee me, an&s;wer'd <HI>Olym|pia;</HI> but I know very well, nothing can give me a greater Satisfaction, than being with you; and tho' I am in Expectation of the on|ly Happine&s;s, that can ble&s;s my Days, yet in quitting this Palace, I cannot help regretting the Ab&s;ence of my charming <HI>Felicia.</HI> How obliging you are, my deare&s;t Companion, (re|plied &s;he) but alas! I &s;hall have the greate&s;t Cau&s;e to regret, when I &s;ee you no more. What Con&s;olation wou'd it be me, were I go|ing with you to <HI>Genoa;</HI> I have &s;ome Rea&s;ons to wi&s;h it. I will not pre&s;ume to ask 'em, &s;aid <HI>Olympia,</HI> fearing you &s;hou'd think my Cu|rio&s;ity too great; but if you will tell me, why you are &s;o de&s;irous of going that Voyage, I &s;hall take it as a mighty Favour. I will grant your Reque&s;t, replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> as &s;oon as my Health permits me, and &s;hall de&s;ire you al&s;o, to acquaint me with &s;ome Particulars, relating to a Per&s;on of that Country. Which <HI>Olympia</HI> promis'd her; and after having &s;taid &s;ome Time with her, &s;he went, and gave the Queen an Account of the Condition &s;he was in.</P>
<P>The mean while, <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea</HI> entertain'd each other with their Grief, whenever they
<PB N="231" REF="235">
found an Opportunity of being alone. Shou'd I inform the Queen of <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Menaces, (&s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> to her Friend) &s;he wou'd take &s;uch Mea&s;ures as might &s;ecure the Peace and Tranquility of her Kingdom, and by &s;ending me for <HI>Spain,</HI> deliver me from his Violence; but (continu'd &s;he, after a Moment's Pau&s;e,) what Reproaches &s;hou'd not I de&s;erve, &s;uppo|&s;ing this young Prince was only urged by his Pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;peak as he did, without having any Thoughts of executing &s;o ra&s;h a De&s;ign, and that upon my Information, he &s;hou'd be arre&s;ted; then his Di&s;grace, and perhaps the Lo&s;s of his Life, wou'd be owing to me? What an ungrateful Return &s;hou'd I make, to the obliging Sentiments he conceiv'd for me, from the Beginning of my Misfortune? <HI>Inea</HI> approv'd very much her prudent Con&s;iderati|ons, and repre&s;ented to her, how willingly the Queen wou'd embrace that Pretence, to make a Sacrifice of <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he only oppos'd, with a De&s;ign to provoke him to u&s;e her with Di&s;re&s;pect, which wou'd con&s;equently bring him to inevitable Puni&s;h|ment; and were it otherways, it wou'd not &s;tand with Rea&s;on, that the Queen &s;hou'd con|cern her &s;elf with any thing &s;o much below her, as a Slave. <HI>Felicia</HI> was of <HI>Inea</HI>'s Opini|on, and thought there was &s;o much Probabi|lity in what &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he cho&s;e rather to be &s;ilent in the Matter, than make a Di&s;cove|ry, which might be the Cau&s;e of greater Di&s;|orders; &s;o implor'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven
<PB N="232" REF="236">
for her Deliverance. As for <HI>Inea,</HI> &s;he had al|ready writ the Particulars of her Voyage, to her Dear Don <HI>Ramire,</HI> and was impatiently waiting his An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion was grown de&s;pe|rate, retired from the Queen's Palace to his own, and there confin'd him&s;elf with his faith|ful <HI>Mula:</HI> Cea&s;e flattering me, &s;aid he, and don't make me hope any thing, from my Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Queen, and <HI>Felicia.</HI> I now am too well inform'd, of what I mu&s;t expect from their Cruelty. As I was walking in the Pa|lace Garden, di&s;tracted and melancholy, I perceiv'd at a Di&s;tance, <HI>Celima</HI> follow'd by her Women; and to avoid paying my Court to her, I retired to a Grotto, under the Terrace-Walk, which I had ju&s;t enter'd, when the Queen leaning on <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Arm, came, and &s;eated her &s;elf in a Place, where I cou'd di|&s;tinctly hear all they &s;aid; no <HI>Mula,</HI> it is not po&s;&s;ible, to expre&s;s the intolerable Aver&s;ion &s;he has to me, and with what Di&s;dain &s;he &s;peaks of me; &s;he has given reiterated Com|mands to that lovely Captive, to fly and hate me, who (ungrateful as &s;he is) not only re|ceiv'd 'em with Plea&s;ure, but even promis'd <HI>Celima</HI> more than &s;he requir'd of her; and it was not long before I felt the Effect of it, for as &s;oon as the Queen was gone back to the Palace, and I cou'd find an Opportunity to &s;peak to this young Slave, &s;he confirm'd with a mo&s;t rigorous Air what I had already heard, and moreover told me, &s;he was in Love with
<PB N="233" REF="237">
One in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that nothing in the World &s;hou'd ever make her change: In a Word, I find there is no Time to be lo&s;t; I mu&s;t im|mediately adhere to the King of <HI>Tituan</HI>'s Pro|po&s;als; that Prince extremely re&s;ents <HI>Celima</HI>'s Refu&s;al; a &s;lighted Pa&s;&s;ion demands Revenge, and he looks on me as One, who is capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him. Before I had &s;een <HI>Felicia,</HI> I wou'd not favour his De&s;igns, thinking the Queen might chu&s;e me to Reign with her: Now I &s;ee my Error; &s;he not only hates me, but even oppo&s;es my Happine&s;s, where-ever I &s;eek it.</P>
<P>If I may be permitted to give you my Ad|vice, my Lord, (reply'd <HI>Mula,)</HI> I am of Opi|nion, you &s;hou'd &s;peak to <HI>Celima,</HI> before you enter into the King of <HI>Tituan</HI>'s Intere&s;t, and try whether you cannot bring her into a more favourable Di&s;po&s;ition for you; 'tis probable, &s;he may make &s;ome &s;erious Reflection, and for her own &s;ake, not provoke you to act any Thing de&s;perate. I am willing to make that one Step more, &s;aid the Prince, tho' ever &s;o nice; but as I believe the Queen has a De&s;ign to take me up, let us be prepar'd for the Wor&s;t: If I am put in Arre&s;t, do you go to <HI>Tunis;</HI> tell <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> the Number of Friends I have in this Court, and manage Affairs &s;o, as by his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and theirs, I may obtain my Liberty, po&s;&s;e&s;s my Love, and be reveng'd.</P>
<P>It was late before <HI>Abelhamar</HI> had ended his Conver&s;ation, which prevented him from go|ing the next Morning to the Queen's Apart|ment;
<PB N="234" REF="238">
and the fir&s;t Thing he heard, was <HI>Feli|cia</HI>'s Illne&s;s. This News caus'd him to be ex|tremely unea&s;y; he &s;oon forgot all other Pro|jects, and fix'd his chiefe&s;t Thoughts, on &s;eek|ing Means to &s;ee the Per&s;on he lov'd; which met with &s;ome Oppo&s;ition, <HI>Celima</HI> having given Orders he &s;hou'd not be admitted into her Chamber; and as for the Governe&s;s of the Slaves, he cou'd not flatter him&s;elf with the Hopes of gaining her, being an old Woman, entirely devoted to the Queen's Will; &s;o that he was almo&s;t de&s;pairing of Succe&s;s in his Enterprize; but what is not Love capable of? It conquers all Difficulties.</P>
<P>The Prince, being young and hand&s;ome, re|&s;olv'd to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf in Woman's Cloaths, in order to be pre&s;ented to the Queen by a Captain of a Ship, with whom he was par|ticularly acquainted. He was a perfect Ma|&s;ter of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue, and did not doubt, but he might ea&s;ily pa&s;s for One of that Nati|on. He told his De&s;ign to <HI>Mula,</HI> who u&s;ed his Endeavours to divert him from an Attempt, which might prove fatal to him; but his Ar|guments were of little Weight, where Love had &s;o great an Influence. He order'd imme|diately his Phy&s;ician to be call'd, and bid him give out every where he was dangerou&s;ly ill of a Feaver, and that it was convenient he &s;hould &s;ee no Company. This News being talk'd of at Court, the Sea-Captain brought him to the Palace, among &s;everal other Slaves, which he had lately taken. The Queen took
<PB N="235" REF="239">
a particular Notice of <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> and ask'd him &s;ome Que&s;tions, which might have puzled him, had not his Wit been prevailing, and his Replies &s;o ingenious, that they did not give her the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of a Di&s;gui&s;e. The Governe&s;s of the Slaves having ask'd his Name, he told her, he was call'd <HI>Eugenia,</HI> and that he was a Native of the Kingdom of <HI>Ca|&s;tile:</HI> The Queen order'd, &s;he &s;hou'd be con|ducted to <HI>Felicia,</HI> who perhaps might know her, and be much pleas'd to &s;ee One of her Country.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> was &s;ent in this manner to <HI>Feli|cia,</HI> who was in Bed, very much indi&s;pos'd. He no &s;ooner enter'd her Chamber, but &s;eeing her in this Condition, he turn'd pale, and &s;eem'd &s;o dejected, that it wou'd have pitied any One, that was pre&s;ent at this Interview. As <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea</HI> believ'd, this new Slave's Affliction proceeded from her late Misfor|tune, they were no ways &s;urpriz'd at the Di&s;|order &s;he was in, but endeavour'd by their kind Expre&s;&s;ions, to &s;often the Rigour of her unhappy State.</P>
<P>The amorous Prince thus continu'd with his dear <HI>Felicia,</HI> and the oftener he &s;aw her, the greater were the Effects of her Charms; which at la&s;t &s;o potently influenced him, that he cou'd not re&s;olve to quit the Palace, e&s;teem|ing him&s;elf too happy in the Company of his adorable Mi&s;tre&s;s. He had &s;o many Perfecti|ons, that it wou'd have been ea&s;y for him to make the Conque&s;t of the Queen's hand&s;ome&s;t
<PB N="236" REF="240">
Slaves, had he made the lea&s;t Pur&s;uit towards it; but his Heart was entirely fill'd with <HI>Feli|cia</HI>'s Idea, and all his Thoughts were employ|ed on the only Care of plea&s;ing her.</P>
<P>She al&s;o very much contributed by her in|nocent Care&s;&s;es, to detain him. Their Hu|mours agreed &s;o well, that &s;he de&s;ired as a Favour, they wou'd let <HI>Eugenia</HI> &s;tay with her during her Illne&s;s. There is a &s;ecret Charm in your Conver&s;ation (&s;aid &s;he, &s;ometimes to her) which gives me a much greater Plea&s;ure, than any I can find in that of my other Com|panions. It is the Effect of my Love for you, beauteous <HI>Felicia,</HI> that in&s;pires you with this Sympathy, replied the pa&s;&s;ionate Prince, and how ble&s;s'd &s;hou'd I be, were I as dear to you, as you are to me! but, continu'd he, if you will give me Leave to tell you my Thoughts, I believe you are indifferent whe|ther belov'd or not. Alas! how great wou'd be my Felicity, (an&s;wer'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> with a me|lancholy Tone) were I &s;uch as you repre&s;ent me: You little know my Sentiments; they give me more Unea&s;ine&s;s, than my unfortu|nate Captivity. What, Madam, &s;aid the pre|tended <HI>Eugenia,</HI> is it po&s;&s;ible, that after hav|ing wholly re&s;ign'd my &s;elf to you, you wou'd make any thing a Secret to me? If your Heart is touch'd with a tender Pa&s;&s;ion, will it not be a Comfort to you to make me your Confi|dent? What &s;hall I &s;ay to you, replied <HI>Felicia?</HI> I can only tell you my Weakne&s;s, and confe&s;s an Engagement, which is &s;o dear to me, that
<PB N="237" REF="241">
it fills my Soul at once with a Thou&s;and dif|ferent Motions. The&s;e Words cruelly affected the Prince, who cou'd not utter one Syllable, but turning pale, he fix'd his Eyes on her, and continu'd &s;ome Time in this Po&s;ture, as a&s;to|ni&s;h'd at what &s;he &s;aid, tho' &s;he had already declar'd her Sentiments to him in the Garden: At la&s;t he endeavour'd to &s;peak, and with a langui&s;hing Accent, &s;aid, I &s;hou'd not be &s;ur|priz'd, &s;o perfect a Creature as you were a|dor'd, yet, <HI>Felicia,</HI> I flatter'd my &s;elf, that far from having lo&s;t your Liberty, you were free from any Pa&s;&s;ion. This Opinion pleas'd me extremely, for although we are of one Sex, I mu&s;t tell you, I take delight in gaining the Affections of a young unpractis'd Heart, who is unacquainted with Sentiments &s;o de&s;tructive to our Peace. This made me conceive a par|ticular Friend&s;hip for you; but I under&s;tand, your Di&s;dain for &s;ome, is equal to your Weak|ne&s;s for others. Oh! what Shame and Di&s;or|der do you cau&s;e in me? (replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> co|vering her Face with her Handkerchief,) I ex|pected in telling you my Secret, you wou'd have pitied, and con&s;ol'd me; alas! do you upbraid me, <HI>Eugenia?</HI> Your Severity will compel me hereafter to fear, and fly you. The unhappy Prince, at the&s;e Words, flung him&s;elf on his Knees, and taking her Hand, ki&s;s'd and bath'd it with Tears; his Speech was &s;up|pre&s;s'd with Sighs, which wou'd have been &s;ufficient to di&s;cover him, were it not that <HI>Felicia</HI> had a &s;trong Opinion of his being of
<PB N="238" REF="242">
her own Sex, and did not in the lea&s;t take Notice of his pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Inea</HI> enter'd the Chamber, whil&s;t they were in this &s;ilent and melancholy Condition: What is the Cau&s;e of this Sorrow, &s;aid &s;he? Is this the Way, <HI>Eugenia,</HI> you entertain our dear &s;ick Lady? You have, without doubt, &s;aid &s;omething to her, which renews the Re|membrance of her pa&s;t Misfortunes. I have &s;aid nothing to <HI>Felicia,</HI> interrupted the Prince immediately, but what was agreeable to her, therefore do not accu&s;e me; I wou'd undergo any Pain my &s;elf, rather than aggravate hers. Alas, <HI>Inea!</HI> &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> here cruel <HI>Eugenia</HI> has been reproaching me with Sentiments, I have for a Per&s;on, whom &s;he her &s;elf wou'd love, were &s;he as well acquainted with him as I am. No (replied <HI>Eugenia)</HI> I am convin|ced of the contrary; I even have an invinci|ble Aver&s;ion to this unknown, who perfidiou&s;|ly robs me of your Heart, which is a Crime not to be forgiven. This is no Subject to create a Di&s;pute between you and I, &s;aid <HI>Fe|licia;</HI> the Affection we have for a Lover, or a Friend, is of &s;o different a Nature, that the one does no Prejudice to the other. Give me Leave to tell you, cry'd the young Prince, that when a Heart is touch'd with a powerful Pa&s;&s;ion, it's incapable of receiving any other Impre&s;&s;ion. Then you don't believe I love you, <HI>Eugenia,</HI> interrupted <HI>Felicia?</HI> I know not what to believe, replied the Prince; but what I am a&s;&s;ur'd of, is, no Creature can be in
<PB N="239" REF="243">
greater De&s;pair. As he ended the&s;e Words, <HI>Olympia</HI> enter'd the Chamber.</P>
<P>It is given out in the Palace, &s;aid &s;he, that Prince <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> having counterfeited a Sick|ne&s;s, is gone away &s;ecretly, in order to a&s;|&s;i&s;t <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> who intends to de|clare War again&s;t the Queen; which News has &s;o much alarm'd her, that &s;he has given Or|ders to &s;earch his Apartment, in &s;pite of what his Phy&s;ician &s;ays to oppo&s;e his being &s;een; and if it be po&s;&s;ible to penetrate into the Queen's Sen|timents by her Unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he is in a great Ap|prehen&s;ion concerning the Con&s;equence of this &s;udden Departure. The Queen's Thoughts and mine are as different as our Intere&s;t, replied <HI>Felicia;</HI> &s;he is concern'd at the Prince's being gone, and I am overjoy'd at it. <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who had not interrupted <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, cou'd not help looking earne&s;tly at <HI>Felicia;</HI> that Prince is very unfortunate, &s;aid he, that his Ab&s;ence &s;hou'd give you &s;o much Plea&s;ure: I perceive the Love and Re&s;pect he has for you, meet with a very unkind Re|turn. What is become of that Complai&s;ance you &s;how'd us at fir&s;t, my dear <HI>Eugenia,</HI> re|plied <HI>Felicia;</HI> you equally blame me for hav|ing an Inclination, and for not having one. I think it wou'd not be rea&s;onable for me to have any other Sentiments for <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> and I am even a&s;&s;ur'd, that if I liked him, you your &s;elf wou'd condemn me. Try, Madam, continu'd <HI>Eugenia,</HI> &s;trive to love the Prince, were it only to be reveng'd, and to puni&s;h me
<PB N="240" REF="244">
for my Capriciou&s;ne&s;s; I promi&s;e you before it be long, I will render his Pa&s;&s;ion very di&s;a|greeable to you. I &s;hall not give you that Trouble, replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> my Con&s;tancy might then be brought in Que&s;tion; it is dangerous to make &s;uch Tryals. The&s;e Words &s;en&s;ibly af|fected <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate Looks ex|pre&s;s'd &s;uch Emotions, that is was &s;urprizing <HI>Felicia, Inea</HI> and <HI>Olympia</HI> &s;u&s;pected nothing extraordinary under the Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>But what Advantage did the young Prince receive from this Stratagem? He &s;aw <HI>Felicia,</HI> and daily di&s;cover'd &s;ome tran&s;cendent Charms, which inflam'd him the more, and increas'd his De&s;pair, when he reflected on the Senti|ments &s;he had for him; for his Pa&s;&s;ion was not only violent, but &s;o nice, that he wou'd not have been &s;atisfy'd with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on, without that of her Heart; and as he knew he had no Share in her Affection, it threw him &s;ometimes into &s;uch a deep Melan|choly, as cou'd not be conceal'd. Be&s;ides, the Queen being inform'd of <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Counterfeit Sickne&s;s, his going off, and part of his De&s;igns, gave Orders, that tho&s;e Offi|cers, who &s;erv'd him, and cou'd give her fur|ther Light into the Affair, might be taken up, and examin'd: She was al&s;o rai&s;ing Troops, repairing the Fortifications of the Town, and taking all Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure her &s;elf again&s;t the In&s;ults of an Enemy, whom &s;he thought already with the King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> tho' every Day in her Chamber, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="241" REF="245">
lying at her Bed's Feet; thus the amou|rous Prince elected his Felicity, in a Confine|ment, where he was expos'd to a Danger he did not apprehend, and good Fortune was &s;o favourable to him till then, that his Di&s;gui&s;e did not give the lea&s;t Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia</HI>'s Illne&s;s, tho' extremely violent, did not continue long; her Youth and good Con&s;titution contributed very much to her &s;peedy Recovery, and gave her Strength e|nough to walk in the Palace Gardens. The Court at that Time was &s;o attentive on the Preparations of War, that the Slaves were not &s;o &s;trictly watch'd as u&s;ual. One Day <HI>Feli|cia, Olympia, Inea,</HI> and our Counterfeit <HI>Euge|nia</HI> taking the Air, had turn'd their Steps to|wards a plea&s;ant Terrace-Walk, which afforded a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect; but the Weather changing, there &s;uddenly ro&s;e a High Wind, &s;ucceeded by terrible Thunder and Hail; which oblig'd them to run for Shelter into a little Summer-Hou&s;e, that had a View on the O|cean.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea</HI> were looking out of a Window, and had been &s;ome Time ob&s;erving the Sea, which furiou&s;ly came, and broke a|gain&s;t the Rocks, making a horrid Noi&s;e, when they perceiv'd a Ship in the greate&s;t Danger; &s;he had lo&s;t all her Ma&s;ts, and thus to&s;s'd from Wave to Wave, was waiting the fatal Moment. The&s;e young Ladies were mov|ed with Compa&s;&s;ion at &s;uch a Sight, and con|cern'd for tho&s;e who were on Board: They
<PB N="242" REF="246">
implor'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, and whil&s;t they were making Vows for their Safety, the Wind decided their De&s;tiny, for the Ship was driven a&s;hore, and there entirely wreck'd. It was a mo&s;t di&s;mal Scene, to &s;ee how the&s;e unfortunate Wretches &s;trove to &s;ave them&s;elves, but their Efforts were fruitle&s;s; they All pe|ri&s;hed excepting One, who was happy enough to reach a little Rock, which lay at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the Shore.</P>
<P>The Storm being allay'd, &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, who had &s;een the Shipwreck, took their Boat, and row'd towards the Rock, where they found the Man I mention'd in a Swoon, and as cold as Death; they took him and brought him a&s;hoar, where they immediately lighted a Fire, and gave him all the Help they were capable of.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things happen'd &s;o near the Summer-Hou&s;e, where our young Captives were reti|red, that they cou'd ea&s;ily &s;ee the Condition this Stranger was in; but how great was <HI>Fe|licia</HI> and <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Di&s;order, when they knew him to be the Count of <HI>La Vagne:</HI> They wou'd have expre&s;s'd their Satisfaction, were it not for the Fear they were in of his being Dead. It is he, (cried <HI>Olympia</HI> in her fir&s;t Tran&s;ports) it is certainly him&s;elf. <HI>Felicia</HI> on the other Side, (pre&s;&s;ing <HI>Inea</HI> and <HI>Eugenia</HI>'s Hands) cou'd no more be Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Moderation; Oh Heavens! &s;aid &s;he to them, my deare&s;t Companions; there is the Man who&s;e Ab&s;ence has given me &s;o much Di&s;plea&s;ure; he appears
<PB N="243" REF="247">
now, ju&s;t as he did when I found him in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Carmona,</HI> where he had been attack|ed by Robbers; the Picture of Death was painted on his Face: I was then in a Conditi|on to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but now alas, I am forced to &s;ee him peri&s;h, without being at Liberty to give him any Help.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was thus &s;peaking to <HI>Inea,</HI> and the di&s;guis'd Prince, <HI>Olympia</HI> left 'em, and ran to a Door adjacent to the Sea-Side, which &s;he caus'd to be opened without any Difficulty, and in a &s;mall Time reach'd the Place where the Count was lying: As &s;oon as <HI>Felicia</HI> per|ceived the Concern, and Care &s;he expre&s;s'd in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, &s;he knew not what to think. I am well per&s;waded, &s;aid &s;he, they are both Natives of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and perhaps Relations; but methinks her Affection is very great, &s;ince &s;he weeps as well as I, and embraces him in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate Manner.</P>
<P>The mean while <HI>Abelhamar</HI> (enrag'd and jea|lous) was acting the greate&s;t Violence on him&s;elf, in not di&s;covering to her who he was, that he might re&s;olve on the immediate Sacrifice of this dangerous Rival. <HI>Inea</HI>'s Thoughts were al&s;o confus'd, and &s;he was hardly able to &s;peak a Word. The more &s;he con&s;ider'd <HI>Olympia</HI>'s tender Concern for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> and the &s;ecret Con&s;olation &s;he &s;eem'd to derive from his Pre&s;ence, the more &s;he &s;igh'd, and &s;ent her Wi&s;hes to her faithful Don <HI>Ramire;</HI> in a Word, it is not to be conceiv'd, how torment|ed they all were by different Cau&s;es of Unea|&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="244" REF="248">
But how was lovely <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Mind employ'd all this while, and what were her inward Motions, when &s;he &s;aw the Count re|covered from his Swoon, who appeared in Tran&s;ports of inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, at the Sight of <HI>Olympia?</HI> He ki&s;s'd her Hand, and fix'd his Eyes on her's, as if Fortune had &s;natch'd him from the Arms of Death, only to lead him into perfect Felicity. Am I then betray'd, (cried <HI>Felicia,</HI> in a faint Voice) and can I believe what I &s;ee? Is the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> in Love with <HI>Olympia?</HI> You ought not in the lea&s;t to doubt it, (an&s;wer'd <HI>Eugenia,</HI> who was very willing to confirm her Su&s;picions) and if you flatter'd your &s;elf with being belov'd, you are mi&s;taken in the Heart of that Traytor; any one may &s;ee by his Actions, that he has a Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Olympia.</HI> Do not have &s;o ra&s;h an Opinion of him, interrupted <HI>Inea;</HI> it's proba|ble he has &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons for acting as he does; perhaps the Count is inform'd of Prince <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Felicia,</HI> and as he is come in order to ran&s;om his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he thought it convenient to conceal his true Sentiments, the better to &s;ucceed in his De|&s;igns. What Plea&s;ure you take in being de|ceiv'd, (cried <HI>Eugenia,</HI> who cou'd not bear to hear her expre&s;s her &s;elf in this Manner;) have you already forgot that <HI>Abelhamar</HI> is &s;u&s;|pected to be with the King of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and con|&s;equently there are no Mea&s;ures to be ob&s;erv'd with him? But the Count knows nothing of it, interrupted <HI>Felicia,</HI> and I am inclin'd to
<PB N="245" REF="249">
believe, <HI>Inea</HI> has interpreted the Sentiments of his Heart. How great is our Weakne&s;s when we love, &s;aid the Prince; we &s;carcely can cre|dit our own Eyes, we are &s;o inclin'd to em|brace any Thing which flatters our Wi&s;hes. Indeed <HI>Eugenia,</HI> replied <HI>Felicia,</HI> you always re|pre&s;ent Things in the fal&s;e&s;t Colours: What have I done to invite you to take &s;uch Delight in tormenting me. The Prince, who perceiv'd &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed, &s;aid no more to her, but re|&s;olv'd in him&s;elf to make the Force of his Re|venge fall on this happy Rival.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia</HI> &s;ent to acquaint the Queen, that the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> was ca&s;t on the Shoar, but had e&s;caped Death, and beg'd Leave to pay his Re&s;pects to her Maje&s;ty. <HI>Celima</HI> (who was exceeding melancholy, and apprehen&s;ive of the Con&s;equences of <HI>Abelha|mar</HI>'s Revolt) declin'd &s;eeing this Stranger, not to let him be Witne&s;s of her Affliction; but &s;ent back to <HI>Olympia,</HI> to tell her, &s;he might bring him to the Palace, where &s;he &s;hou'd have an Apartment prepared for him in One of the remote Pavilions, having given Orders that he &s;hou'd be receiv'd with a Di&s;tinction equal to his Birth; to this &s;he added, how willing &s;he &s;hou'd be to admit him, were &s;he not in|di&s;pen&s;ibly oblig'd to attend &s;ome Affairs of the highe&s;t Moment. She gave Orders al&s;o, that they &s;hou'd &s;upply him with all Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and &s;everal Slaves immediately brought him Variety of rich Garments, that he might plea&s;e his Fancy.

the Queen Thanks for her Favours, the Count was conducted through the Gardens to the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia, Inea</HI> and <HI>Eugenia,</HI> were walking in an Alley, which had a View on the Sea-Side, when the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> came up pretty near to them; <HI>Felicia</HI> perceiving him, her Heart fluttered, and &s;he grew &s;o faint in an In&s;tant, that had not <HI>Inea</HI> &s;upported her on one Side, and the di&s;guis'd Prince on the o|ther, &s;he would not have been able to &s;tand; but the Count (who had no Cau&s;e to remark her Motions, tho' in Favour of him&s;elf) pa&s;s'd by the Ladies, and only &s;aluted them with much Re&s;pect, without taking any particular Notice of <HI>Felicia.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone far enough from her not to be heard; Oh Heaven! cry'd &s;he, is it po&s;&s;ible he can be &s;o much Ma&s;ter of his Temper, as not to &s;how &s;ome Tenderne&s;s in his Eyes? He looks as if he had never &s;een me: What means this Indifference, <HI>Inea?</HI> Are the&s;e his Tran&s;ports? Oh! What mu&s;t I think of his Pa&s;&s;ion? Madam! reply'd <HI>Inea,</HI> is not his coming hither to fetch you away, a &s;uffi|cient Motive to convince you of his Fidelity? <HI>Inea</HI> only deceives you, interrupted the Prince, for I have &s;een many Per&s;ons in Love, and can a&s;&s;ure you, that altho' they were in a con|tinual Re&s;traint, and obliged to be on their Guard in the Pre&s;ence of jealous Ob&s;ervers, yet their Pa&s;&s;ion di&s;cover'd it &s;elf in their Eyes and Actions. Why (continu'd he, addre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="247" REF="251">
him&s;elf to <HI>Inea)</HI> do you really think the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> was overjoy'd to &s;ee <HI>Felicia?</HI> He did not &s;o much as change Colour, nor even fix his Eyes on hers: No, no, his Pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o violent as you imagine; and if you continue &s;peaking in his Favour, you only do it with an Intent to &s;ooth our Friend's Pain. Don't torment me in this Manner, cruel Crea|ture, cry'd <HI>Felicia;</HI> am I not unfortunate e|nough already? Why will you per&s;i&s;t in &s;aying &s;uch vexatious Things to me?

<P><HI>Felicia</HI> fearing it wou'd be taken Notice of at the Palace, that &s;he had been &s;o long Abroad, returned &s;peedily to her Chamber, which &s;he no &s;ooner enter'd, but wrote to the Count in the following Terms.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>I Have now &s;ome Rea&s;on to flatter my &s;elf, that Heaven will &s;oon put a Period to my Misfor|tunes, &s;ince Love and Genero&s;ity have invited you here to your</HI> Felicia<HI>'s Deliverance.

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter cou'd not be convey'd to the Count without &s;ome Difficulty. <HI>Felicia</HI> bid <HI>Inea</HI> read it, and conjured her to find Means to have it immediately deliver'd into his Hands. I cannot think on any Way, reply'd <HI>Inea,</HI> but to carry it my &s;elf. Your &s;elf! cry'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> how will you venture to do it? Leave that to me, Madam, an&s;wer'd <HI>Inea,</HI> I will run any Ri&s;que to &s;erve you. This is very generous, my dear Companion, &s;aid <HI>Felicia;</HI> then thank|ed her for &s;o obliging an Offer, and de&s;ir'd her, &s;ince &s;he was willing to render her &s;o con&s;iderable a Service, not to defer it.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia</HI> was now in the Queen's Apartment, and the Count in his, but being extremely im|patient to &s;ee his lovely Mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;tep'd in|to the Garden in Expectation of meeting her; It was a fine Moon-light Night, and as he was walking with his Thoughts wholly em|ploy'd on the Happine&s;s he promis'd him&s;elf, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Lady, for whom he had &s;o tran&s;cendent a Pa&s;&s;ion; young <HI>Inea</HI> (wrap|ed
<PB N="249" REF="253">
in her white Vail) acco&s;ted him, and &s;aid, read this Letter, my Lord; it comes from a Per&s;on who ought to be dear to you. The Count open'd it, and was &s;urpriz'd not to know the Writing; after having read it over, and over, without conceiving the Meaning, it came into his Head, that it was a Je&s;t <HI>O|lympia</HI> had imagin'd to divert her &s;elf, &s;o &s;aid to <HI>Inea,</HI> I de&s;ire you will tell the beauteous Lady, from whom I receive this Favour, that I intend my &s;elf to be Bearer of the An&s;wer.</P>
<P>As <HI>Inea</HI> was going back, &s;he perceiv'd a Woman at a Di&s;tance cover'd with her Vail, who was coming towards her, and fearing &s;he &s;hou'd be known by her, &s;he pa&s;s'd on the o|ther Side of the Palli&s;adoes, and went into the long Walk, where &s;he found <HI>Felicia,</HI> who taking her under the Arm, &s;aid to her in a low Voice; you will think me very impati|ent to know what the Count has &s;aid to you, but that is not the only Rea&s;on which brought me hither. I was looking out of my Chamber-Window, waiting your Return, when I &s;aw a Woman cro&s;s the Garden with great Dili|gence, and go, as it were, towards the Count's Pavilion: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my dear <HI>Inea,</HI> it gave me much Unea&s;ine&s;s, and I made all po&s;&s;i|ble Ha&s;te to follow her. As far as I cou'd di|&s;tingui&s;h, &s;he appear'd to me to be <HI>Olympia,</HI> and I believe it is her. Oh! <HI>Inea,</HI> how my Heart akes! and in what Torment is my Mind, for fear of lo&s;ing the Object of my Love? Judge more favourably of the Count, &s;aid <HI>Inea,</HI> in|terrupting
<PB N="250" REF="254">
her; he read your Letter with an extreme Attention, and addre&s;&s;ing me in very obliging Terms, a&s;&s;ur'd me, he wou'd an&s;wer it per&s;onally. It's very well, continu'd <HI>Feli|cia,</HI> but let us go on without making a Noi&s;e; we may perhaps, di&s;cover where that Per&s;on is going, whom I mention'd to you. In fini&s;h|ing the&s;e Words, they walk'd on, hiding them&s;elves behind the Palli&s;adoes; and hear|ing &s;ome Body talk in an Arbour, which was at the End of the Alley, they drew near.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> and <HI>Olympia,</HI> were conver&s;ing together in this Place; it is impo&s;&s;i|ble, Madam, &s;aid he to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, for me to expre&s;s the De&s;pair I was in, when I heard of your Death, and the Circum&s;tances which pre|ceded it; they &s;o intirely affected me, that even Life began to be odious to me, and never was Mortal in a more de&s;olate Condition. But how tran&s;ported was I, at the unexpected Change of Fortune, when the Jeweller (who had &s;een you in the Queen's Apartment) in|form'd me, that the &s;ame beauteous <HI>Olympia,</HI> who&s;e Lo&s;s I was deploring, was actually living, and at <HI>Sallee;</HI> judge&mdash;I well con|ceive, my dear Count, &s;aid &s;he, interrupting him, what might employ your Thoughts in Two &s;uch different Occa&s;ions; as our Affecti|on is mutual, we &s;ympathize in all the Plea|&s;ure and Torment, which derives from our good or bad Fortune; you may imagine after what I &s;uffer'd for your &s;uppo&s;ed Death, how exce&s;&s;ive was my Joy, when I heard of your
<PB N="251" REF="255">
Safety. I have told you already, &s;aid the Count, that your illu&s;trious Father has given his Con&s;ent to our happy Union, receiving my Propo&s;als with &s;uch extraordinary Marks of Friend&s;hip, that I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;hou'd have &s;u&s;pected &s;o uncommon a Favour, were it not that my long Sufferings give me a Ti|tle to &s;o great a Reward. Yes, continu'd he, mo&s;t divine <HI>Olympia,</HI> you are now to be mine, and I for ever yours. As they were &s;peaking in this manner, a doleful Voice interrupted them, which (repeating the&s;e Words, <HI>I am dy|ing,)</HI> gave 'em to under&s;tand, that &s;ome Per|&s;on very near the Arbour, was taken ill. This induc'd them to di&s;continue their Conver&s;ati|on, tho' ever &s;o delightful, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Lady, who was complaining &s;o di&s;mally.</P>

<HI>Olympia</HI> (without making any Reply, tho' extremely a&s;toni&s;h'd at what &s;he heard) went to give Notice to <HI>Eugenia,</HI> and &s;ome other of the Slaves, of the Condition <HI>Felicia</HI> was in, and the mean while the Count &s;taid by her. No, &s;aid he to <HI>Inea,</HI> I cannot go from you, till you have unriddled this Secret to me; was it not you that ju&s;t now gave me a Letter, which I do not under&s;tand the meaning of?

<P>He little knew the Danger which threaten'd him; all his Thoughts were then employ'd on the State <HI>Felicia</HI> was in, nor cou'd he reflect on any thing more tormenting.

Ah! my Lord, (cry'd <HI>Felicia</HI> in a dejected Tone,) I de&s;ire nothing but Death, therefore give me Leave to complain, and do not interrupt my Grief with Propo&s;als, which I cannot accept.

Motions of his Soul. <HI>Felicia</HI> was not in a Condition to ob&s;erve the De&s;pair, this young Prince was reduc'd to, but renew'd her Complaints, and nothing cou'd re&s;train the Cour&s;e of her Tears. What are you doing, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Inea</HI> to her?

Call Revenge to your Aid, Madam; forget a Man who for&s;akes you, and let your Di&s;dain be the Reward of his Fal&s;ity. It is ea&s;y, my Dear, reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> to give Advice on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, I wou'd do the &s;ame to you, were you in my Ca&s;e, and I in your's: But do you think, it is in our Power to act as we plea&s;e, when Love has once ren|der'd him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of our Inclinations? Ah! cruel Rival, what Torment do you give me? And you perfidious Count, &s;hall not I &s;ee you puni&s;h'd for your Ingratitude? Imploy my Arm, Madam, interrupted the Prince, and with your Con&s;ent, I will revenge you of your perjur'd Lover. I wou'd &s;ooner re&s;olve to die, &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> than yield to &s;o inhuman a Pro|po&s;al; the only Favour I de&s;ire of you, my Lord, (which I conjure you not to deny me) is, that you will leave me; you are no longer <HI>Eugenia,</HI> you are a Prince whom I dare not admit at this Time of Night into my Cham|ber; my Peace and Honour depend on your Compliance: Think of the Danger you ex|po&s;e

your &s;elf to, for a Per&s;on who can make you no Return. That is the only Misfortune I fear, interrupted <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> every Thing el&s;e might be ea&s;ily &s;urmounted.

The Prince, perceiving it was in vain to re&s;i&s;t, withdrew, but not with|out a&s;&s;uring her, that altho' he were to &s;uffer innumerable Torments, thro' her Indifferency, yet his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hou'd ever be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia Doria,</HI> all that Evening, had not found an Opportunity to &s;peak to the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> which made her pa&s;s the re&s;t of that Night in &s;uch an Agitation of Mind, as troubled the Joy &s;he ought to have receiv'd, at &s;o agreeable a Change in her Fortune. What means, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Felicia</HI>'s &s;wooning away, and <HI>Inea</HI>'s Anger; cou'd they have &s;uch Mo|tions for a Stranger? Yet the Count pretends not to know them, and this Di&s;&s;imulation &s;eems to me very Criminal; how can I tell, whether in his Travels he did not come ac|quainted with this young Lady, and who can a&s;&s;ure me, they do not love each other? The&s;e melancholy Thoughts tormented her cruelly, and the Count on his Side was not le&s;s unea|&s;y, fearing <HI>Olympia</HI> wou'd let her &s;elf be de|ceiv'd by Appearances; for tho' he cou'd not penetrate into this My&s;tery, he &s;aw enough to make him apprehend, it might give his Mi|&s;tre&s;s &s;ome Su&s;picion; and as his Pa&s;&s;ion for her invited him to prefer Death to her Di&s;|plea&s;ure, he impatiently waited for Morning to undeceive her.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="264">
As they had an equal De&s;ire to entertain one another, they ro&s;e early, and met on the Terrace-Walk. <HI>Olympia,</HI> the better to know the Count's Sentiments, endeavour'd to con|ceal her Unea&s;ine&s;s, but her Melancholy &s;oon di&s;cover'd her &s;ecret Thoughts. The Count al&s;o appear'd &s;o dejected, that one might ea|&s;ily imagine what pa&s;s'd in his Soul: He broke Silence fir&s;t, and ask'd her, how &s;he had re|pos'd? To which &s;he an&s;wer'd with Indifferen|cy, that &s;he had re&s;ted very ill, without know|ing the Cau&s;e: Here <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Sighs inter|rupted her Di&s;cour&s;e. Ah, Madam! (&s;aid the Count, pro&s;trating him&s;elf at her Feet) do not let me be long uncertain of my De&s;tiny; you are not the &s;ame you were Ye&s;terday; what have I done, to de&s;erve from you &s;o cold a Reception? I have not Re&s;olution enough to be &s;ilent, reply'd <HI>Olympia,</HI> tho' it was my De&s;ign; it is unju&s;t to harbour Su&s;picions of the Per&s;on one loves, without coming to an Eclairci&s;ement. Tell me, my Lord, Do you &s;till love <HI>Felicia?</HI> I &s;ay &s;till, becau&s;e after what has pa&s;s'd, I have no Rea&s;on to doubt, but you once had a Pa&s;&s;ion for her. The Count wou'd not let <HI>Olympia</HI> per&s;evere in an Error, which was to the Prejudice of his Honour; he &s;con by his Prote&s;tations per&s;waded her of the contrary, then offer'd to go with her to ju&s;tify him&s;elf before <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea.</HI> I believe you, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, without &s;uch a Proof, &s;ince I had much rather you &s;hou'd not &s;ee 'em any more.

Let us de|part, reply'd the tran&s;ported Count, there is nothing I wi&s;h &s;o much; I have a Ship now ready to &s;ail for <HI>Italy,</HI> and only waits for a favourable Wind; may Heavens protect our Voyage, and bring me to my long wi&s;h'd for Happine&s;s; come, Madam, added he, di&s;po&s;e all Things for your Departure; every Mo|ment will &s;eem to me an Age, till <HI>Hymen</HI> has crown'd my Love with the Union of our De|&s;tinies.</P>
<P>The&s;e endearing Expre&s;&s;ions highly pleas'd <HI>Olympia,</HI> who immediately went to the Queen, and obtain'd Leave to embark; <HI>Celima</HI> at the &s;ame Time re&s;tor'd to their Liberty the young Slaves that were taken with <HI>Olympia,</HI> then pre&s;ented her with her Picture, &s;et round with Diamonds of great Value, and repeated to her, what &s;he had already &s;aid in Behalf of the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> withal, that at another Time, &s;he &s;hou'd have been very glad to &s;ee him. <HI>Olympia,</HI> having return'd her Acknow|ledgments in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful Manner, went into the Slaves Apartment, where &s;he cho&s;e the Ladies I mention'd, and took her Leave of the re&s;t, who by their Tears and Care&s;&s;es &s;hew'd the particular Affection they had for her. As &s;he doubted whether it were proper to &s;ee <HI>Felicia,</HI> &s;he de&s;ir'd the Governe&s;s of the

Slaves to acquaint her with her Departure; but at the Name of <HI>Olympia,</HI> and the News of her going away, &s;he fetch'd a Shriek, and made &s;uch Complaints, as wou'd have in&s;pir'd the harde&s;t Heart with Pity: <HI>Olympia</HI> hearing this, wou'd not aggravate her Pain by her Pre&s;ence, and tho' &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h'd to entertain <HI>Felicia,</HI> that &s;he might know from her, whether the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> was &s;in|cere in what he had told her, yet &s;he was no ways willing to &s;atisfy her &s;elf, at the Expence of &s;o amiable a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Count was expecting <HI>Olympia</HI> with Im|patience, when &s;he came to tell him the Fa|vours &s;he had receiv'd from the Queen, who order'd &s;ome of her Officers to accompany them to the Ship.

Don't indulge your Affliction, Madam, interrupted <HI>Inea;</HI> think only, that he who leaves you, is unworthy of the Tears you &s;hed; reflect on his Ingratitude, and it will be an effectual Way to forget him.

He look'd on the Citadel of that Town as a Place, where his Life and Di&s;a&s;ters were to be termi|nated. Here, &s;aid he! here, I expect to &s;ee the ungrateful Beauty I adore, and before her Eyes, I will attack the ungenerous Man, who next her &s;elf had the fir&s;t Place in my Heart. What a &s;trange De&s;tiny is this, cry'd he? My Mi&s;tre&s;s and my Friend equally betray me, and to &s;atisfy my Re&s;entment, I mu&s;t de&s;troy the One, to wound the Other. It is probable, they are this fatal Hour contriving my Ruin, and giving each other fre&s;h A&s;&s;urances of eter|nal Love; but my Death mu&s;t confirm their Felicity, for whil&s;t I am living, they have a cruel Enemy, who will endeavour to defeat their Projects, and ever trouble the Happine&s;s they propo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="270">
At his Arrival, he had a mind to go direct|ly to the Citadel, for (as I told you before) he had accepted of a Letter from the Gover|nour of <HI>Carmona,</HI> to his Son Don <HI>Gabriel d' A|guillar,</HI> by who&s;e Intere&s;t he was &s;ure of an ea&s;y Entrance into the Place; but he thought it was better fir&s;t to &s;end to him, and the mean Time inform him&s;elf of what pa&s;s'd there. As he was going thro' the Town, he met a <HI>French</HI> Chevalier of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bouci|cault;</HI> his Name was <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> a Per&s;on of an obliging Temper, who came to <HI>Seville</HI> with the Count of <HI>La March.</HI> What do I &s;ee? Is it you, my Lord, (cry'd he, coming up to the Prince, with a great deal of Joy and Re&s;pect;) are you living, whom we &s;o much lamented with the Prince your Brother, believing you were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated near <HI>Carmona,</HI> as it was re|ported in <HI>Spain,</HI> and for which we were medi|tating a proportionable Revenge? I &s;hou'd have been happy, my Dear <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> (&s;aid the Prince) had my Enemy's De&s;igns been effect|ed, but I am re&s;erv'd for greater Calamities; yet I de&s;ire my Name may be kept &s;ecret, for important Rea&s;ons, which engage me to con|ceal it, and you can be very &s;erviceable to me. I am in love, and betray'd, and mu&s;t revenge my &s;elf on my Rival and my Mi&s;tre&s;s. Oh! how I &s;hall load <HI>Felicia</HI> with my ju&s;t Re|proaches? She is now in the Citadel with him. What you &s;ay is true, my Lord, inter|rupted <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> I know it from Don <HI>Gabriel d' Aguillar,</HI> who is one of my particular Friends:
<PB N="267" REF="271">
<HI>Felicia</HI> is confin'd again&s;t her Will, in an Apartment where &s;he &s;ees no Body, but by the Means of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain I have al|ready mentioned; one Night, without being perceiv'd, I &s;aw her &s;adly deploring her Fate. Oh! my Lord, how Young and Hand&s;om &s;he is; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I extremely pity her.</P>
<P>Do you pity her, &s;aid the Prince with a deep Sigh? Have you any Compa&s;&s;ion for her? Ah! you are little acquainted with her Perfidi|ou&s;ne&s;s; but tell me, what means that manner of Confinement? Did not you &s;ee her come here with Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez,</HI> the Governour's Nephew? No, reply'd <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> the Per&s;on you name has not appear'd here &s;ince my Arrival, for as I am every Day at the Citadel, I &s;hou'd probably have &s;een him; yet if he be there, he certainly keeps him&s;elf conceal'd. Ah, the Traitor! cry'd the Prince, he is only hid for <HI>Felicia</HI>'s &s;ake, and without doubt has de&s;ir'd a Guard to protect him from my Re|&s;entment. The Villain has &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to fear me; it is dangerous to in&s;ult a de&s;perate Man who does not value his Life. This Thought made the Prince fly into &s;o violent a Pa&s;&s;ion, that <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> beg'd of him to retire from the Place where they were &s;tanding, for fear they might be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;aid to him, if you will prevent my committing any Extravagancies, you mu&s;t &s;econd the De&s;ire I have of &s;eeing <HI>Benavidez,</HI> and <HI>Felicia.</HI> I have a Letter for Don <HI>Gabriel d'Aguillar,</HI> who I am glad to hear is your
<PB N="268" REF="272">
Friend; you will oblige me extremely in &s;end|ing in&s;tantly to him, that we may take nece&s;|&s;ary Mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e. <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> pro|mis'd the Prince every thing that depended on him, even at the Hazard of his Life, then left him to execute his Orders.</P>
<P>Whatever Enquiry <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> and Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> made, before they came to the Prince, they cou'd learn nothing &s;atisfactory; tho&s;e to whom they apply'd concerning Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez,</HI> told 'em, they believ'd he was at <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> but that he was not Nephew to Don <HI>Alonzo Fajardo,</HI> and that no body had &s;een him at <HI>Jaen,</HI> where hardly any one knew him. When they brought this Account to the Prince, he cou'd not believe 'em. Since <HI>Feli|cia</HI> is in the Citadel, interrupted he, 'tis a certain Con&s;equence <HI>Benavidez</HI> is not far; do you only contrive that I enter her Apart|ment; it is likely he will come there when every body is retired. Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> told him he &s;hou'd be obey'd; then went to receive Orders from the Governour, who named him for <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Guard; at Night he came back to the Prince, to conduct him and <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> to the Citadel.</P>
<P>Now can any Mortal imagine the Trouble this amorous Prince was in, when he thought, he was &s;ure to &s;ee the Object he &s;till ador'd; he re&s;olv'd his Rival &s;hou'd peri&s;h, tho' he him|&s;elf were to fall with him; which violent Re|flection made him &s;igh deeply, e&s;pecially when he con&s;ider'd that this &s;ame <HI>Felicia</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="273">
was <HI>Leonida</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> to whom he was &s;o &s;trictly engag'd, that his Honour wou'd not &s;uffer any other to carry her off.</P>
<P>He was in this Confu&s;ion of Thought, where Love and Revenge were equally concern'd, when Don <HI>Gabriel</HI> conducted him through &s;eve|ral Courts, till at la&s;t he brought him to the Tower, where <HI>Felicia</HI> was conceal'd in a low Apartment; the Windows were bar'd with Iron-Grates, and the Weather being exce&s;&s;ive hot, &s;he had obtain'd leave to walk on the Leads of the Tower for the Air; the Prince took that Opportunity to enter a Clo&s;et, which was only &s;hut with a Gla&s;s Door, and there hid him&s;elf behind the Window Curtain, from whence he could &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed. He was not there long, before the Lights were taken away, and he heard two Per&s;ons creep into the Clo&s;et; they &s;poke very low, and the Night be|ing dark, he could not di&s;tingui&s;h whether they were Men or Women; &s;oon after, they went out of the Clo&s;et, where the Prince thought him&s;elf alone, but the Lights being brought in again, he &s;aw &s;everal Women; who were pre|paring a Bath. They hung a Canopy of ro&s;e|colour'd Sattin, embroider'd with Silver, over a large black Marble Ve&s;&s;el, which they fill'd with Water and Flowers, mix'd with the fine&s;t Perfumes.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, a Lady came in, to whom the re&s;t of the Women &s;hewed much Re&s;pect, but he could not &s;ee her Face, her Head being covered with a fine Veil; this was <HI>Felicia,</HI> who having undre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf to

a thin Night-Gown, ordered all her Women to retire, excepting <HI>Zaida;</HI> then called for her Lute, &s;aying, Mu&s;ick only can &s;ooth my dear Afflictions.

<L>WHY &s;hou'd Virtue thus torment me,</L>

<P>She repeated the la&s;t Stanza &s;everal times, and fetch'd now and then deep Sighs, which &s;hew'd her Heart was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a mighty Pa&s;&s;ion, as well as exce&s;&s;ive Grief. The Prince all this while perceiv'd it was not the Voice of his uncon&s;tant <HI>Felicia,</HI> or at lea&s;t was &s;ur|priz'd, that the &s;mall di&s;tance which was be|tween them &s;hou'd cau&s;e &s;o great an Altera|tion in her Tone, as not to know it again.

nothing to evince you of his Affection? <HI>Feli|cia</HI> made no Reply, but order'd her to &s;hut her Chamber Door, and went into the Bath. How entirely do I love you, cruel <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;aid the amorous Prince to him&s;elf? But Oh, ungrateful Woman! ought not I to be a&s;ham|ed of my Weakne&s;s? For let me look upon you as a Per&s;on to whom I am contracted, or as a Mi&s;tre&s;s I love to Di&s;traction, you have equally deceiv'd me under the Titles of <HI>Caren|cy,</HI> and <HI>La Vagne.</HI> Ah, perfidious Creature! you are now propo&s;ing to &s;urmount all Diffi|culties, in order to marry <HI>Benavidez:</HI> Cou'd there be a Complaint more pa&s;&s;ionate, than that which you ju&s;t now utter'd?

<P>Such were the Prince's Reflections, and in &s;pite of his Re&s;entment, Love &s;till triumph'd in his Heart; but in what &s;urprize was he, when <HI>Zaida</HI> opening the Door of another Clo|&s;et, he drew the Curtain, and &s;aw a Man go|ing with Precipitation to the bathing Ve&s;&s;el, where he put him&s;elf on his Knees, and &s;poke &s;o low, that his Voice cou'd not reach the Prince, who only heard <HI>Felicia</HI> cry aloud, is it you, my dear Lover; then &s;he &s;wooned away.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="276">
The Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> &s;eeing this, cou'd no longer refrain, but without thinking on the Con&s;equence of the Scene he was going to o|pen, ran out of the Clo&s;et like a Madman, and had he been capable of taking any ba&s;e Advantage, it was in his power to run him (he took for <HI>Benavidez)</HI> thro' the Body, before the other cou'd even put him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture of Defence; for <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Swoon had &s;uch an extraordinary Effect upon him, that he did not &s;ee the Prince, who was ju&s;t at his Back, till hearing &s;ome body threatening him with a furious Tone, he ro&s;e and drew his Sword; but the Prince &s;eeing his Face, immediately drop'd the Point of his, knowing him to be Don <HI>A|lonzo,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Infanta Don <HI>Fernand;</HI> he had &s;een him at <HI>Seville,</HI> when he was there with his Brother, the Count of <HI>La March;</HI> and the fine Qualities of this young Prince had engag'd the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> to have a great E&s;teem for him; he ca&s;t his Eyes on her, whom he took for <HI>Leoni|da,</HI> and knew her to be Dona <HI>Felicia d' Ayala,</HI> Daughter to the Great Chancellor of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> who was highly di&s;tigui&s;h'd by his Birth, and renown'd for the Hi&s;tories of Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> and Don <HI>Henriquez,</HI> Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> which he had written.

than you thro' this Mi&s;take. I do not re&s;ent it in the lea&s;t, my Lord, (reply'd Don <HI>Alonzo,</HI> embracing him) and if you will promi&s;e to keep this Secret, you &s;hall ever find me a grateful Friend. The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> gave him his Word, he wou'd never take the lea&s;t No|tice of what had happen'd, and without &s;tay|ing till <HI>Felicia</HI> was come to her &s;elf, he left the Chamber in &s;o deep a De&s;pair, that he cou'd &s;carcely &s;peak to <HI>Gabriel d Aguilar,</HI> who was at the Door of the fir&s;t Room, with <HI>Al|phon&s;o,</HI> and this la&s;t attended him to Don <HI>Ga|briel</HI>'s Apartment, who was oblig'd to remain in his Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Prince having an Opportunity of yield|ing him&s;elf up to his ju&s;t Sorrow, call'd to mind all his Misfortunes, from his fir&s;t ap|pearing in the World, to that Moment; on whatever Side he turn'd his Eyes, he &s;aw &s;o little Hopes of an Intermi&s;&s;ion, that every thing became indifferent to him, and he did not even wi&s;h him&s;elf a better Fortune.

Ah, my Lord! interrupted <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> do not harbour a Thought &s;o offen&s;ive to your Courage. 'Tis unworthy a Soul &s;o great as your's &s;hou'd yield to a Pa&s;&s;ion, which will divert you from the Per|formance of great Exploits. The Prince blu&s;h'd at what <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> &s;aid, and look'd on this Di&s;cour&s;e, as a Reproach made him, for the time he had employ'd in entertaining his amorous Sentiments; You &s;hall &s;ee by my Con|duct, reply'd he, that my Soul is &s;till my own: I love, 'tis true, and cannot flatter my&s;elf with ever being di&s;engag'd from a Pa&s;&s;ion, which has &s;o great an Empire over me; yet when Honour calls me I am ready to attend; and if I mu&s;t give up my Life it &s;hall be in &s;o glori|ous a way as will do Honour to my Name.</P>
<P>Here they where both &s;ilent &s;ome time, till the Prince, urg'd by di&s;agreeable Thoughts, broke out into his u&s;ual Complaints: Oh, <HI>Al|phon&s;o!</HI> &s;aid he, which way &s;hall I direct my Cour&s;e to find <HI>Leonida?</HI> I cannot hear where

<P><HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> over-joy'd to hear the Prince &s;peak in the&s;e Terms, applauded a De&s;ign &s;o worthy of him. Con&s;ider, my Lord, &s;aid he, that all you cou'd do at pre&s;ent for <HI>Leonida,</HI> wou'd meet with no Return; for &s;ince &s;he flies you, 'tis proable, you are the Object of her Aver|&s;ion; at lea&s;t, her going off with <HI>Benavidez</HI> is a Proof, &s;he loves him, and is perfidious to you: What can you then expect from her?

I ought to take your Advice indeed, interrupted the Prince, but alas! how is it po&s;&s;ible? For|tune may be incon&s;tant, but my Heart can ne|ver change.

The Governour of <HI>Jaen</HI> admired his Courage, and thought Heaven had &s;ent him to defend that City again&s;t the Infidels.</P>
<P>The King of the <HI>Moors</HI> enrag'd at his ill Succe&s;s, and attributing the Cau&s;e to the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> whom they call'd the Knight of the black Arms, order'd &s;ome of the brave&s;t of his Army, either to kill, or take him Pri|&s;oner; &s;o immediately the Generals and mo&s;t of the Noblemen made a League to be re|veng'd of this terrible Enemy, or peri&s;h in the Attempt. A Detachment was &s;ent out the next Day, much &s;uperior to that under the Prince's Command. Nevertherle&s;s he attack'd them, and his Courage &s;urpa&s;s'd all that can be imagin'd. The <HI>Moors</HI> were beginning to re|pent their ra&s;h Undertaking, when unluckily the Prince's Hor&s;e was wounded by an Arrow; and before he cou'd di&s;engage him&s;elf, they
<PB N="280" REF="284">
ru&s;h'd upon him with a Shout, and took him Pri&s;oner. This News ran thro' the Camp, and &s;oon found way into the Town, where it had a different Effect; <HI>Mahomet</HI> thought now he had conquer'd, and the Governour believ'd him&s;elf overcome. The Barbarians were re|&s;olv'd to make a general A&s;&s;ault, and the Chri&s;tians were preparing to defend them|&s;elves, tho' mo&s;t of the Soldiers were mighti|ly di&s;hearten'd, &s;aying to one another, what can we pretend to? We have lo&s;t the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> commanded by him, we might have defeated our Enemies, but his Misfortune is the Pre&s;age of ours.</P>
<P>At this time the Infanta omitted nothing for the Succour of <HI>Jaen:</HI> He a&s;&s;embled his Troops with great Diligence, and march'd to|wards the Town with the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> where he &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Moors,</HI> who retir'd with more Shame than Glory, &s;atisfying them&s;elves with burning, and pillaging, wherever they pa&s;s'd. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pur&s;u'd them as far as <HI>Malaga,</HI> which they be&s;ieg'd in their turn. The Infanta was inform'd by Don <HI>Alon&s;o Fa|jardo,</HI> of the young Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI>'s be|ing taken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Mahomet;</HI> as for his Friend <HI>Alphon&s;o,</HI> he was kill'd in one of the Engagements, which was the Cau&s;e that the Count of <HI>La March</HI> heard nothing of the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI>'s being there. The mighty Cha|racter of his Bravery, and the Recital of the great Actions he had perform'd, gave the In|fanta a particular Concern for his Misfortune;
<PB N="281" REF="285">
he &s;ent an Officer with Propo&s;als for the Exchange of Pri&s;oners, and offer'd a Ran&s;om for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> being willing to purcha&s;e his Liberty at any rate; but all he cou'd do to get him out of his Enemies Power was in vain; the <HI>Moors</HI> made An&s;wer, that the Count having brib'd his Guards, had made his E&s;cape, and that were he &s;till in their Hands, they wou'd readily &s;end him back, to &s;hew how de&s;irous they were to oblige the In|fanta.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Granada</HI> in the mean time was of Opinion, that he cou'd not too &s;trictly guard a Per&s;on, who had been very trouble|&s;ome to him during the Siege; therefore Poli|cy and Revenge having an equal &s;hare in this De&s;ign, he order'd that the Prince (tho' dan|gerou&s;ly wounded) &s;hou'd be convey'd to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Solobrena,</HI> where his Brother, Prince <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> with his two Sons, <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>O&s;min,</HI> were kept Pri&s;oners; &s;o the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> found him&s;elf a &s;econd time in the Power of the Infidels; but his Sentiments were quite different from tho&s;e he had at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> for that which at another time wou'd have given him much Chagrin, had now very little Effect on him, all his Thoughts being only imploy'd on <HI>Leonida,</HI> and every thing el&s;e below his Con&s;ideration; yet it was an unhappy State, for a Man to love an Object, whom he Thought guilty of the greate&s;t Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was the State of Affairs in Upper <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Murcia, Celima</HI> Queen of
<PB N="282" REF="286">
<HI>Fez</HI> was taking Mea&s;ures to be reveng'd of <HI>Abelhamar. Felicia</HI> had but ju&s;t oblig'd him to leave her Chamber, when the Queen (im|patient to have her De&s;igns executed) caus'd him to be &s;eiz'd by a Captain of her Guards, who carry'd him immediately to a Tower adjoyning the Palace, and having po&s;ted a Guard at every Gate to hinder People from coming near, the Queen went to him &s;oon after.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> did not appear the lea&s;t &s;urpriz'd at his Confinement; he &s;aid to this Prince&s;s, My Sentiments, Madam, are not unknown to you, &s;ince you are inform'd of the Love I have for <HI>Felicia;</HI> I have not acted any thing contrary to the Allegiance and Re&s;pect I owe you, and tho' you find me di&s;guis'd in your Palace, it wou'd not con&s;i&s;t with Ju&s;tice, to draw an ill Con&s;equence from an Action, that is only the Effect of my Pa&s;&s;ion, to which you can impute no other Crime, but that of In|di&s;cretion. I know too well your Intentions (interrupted the Queen in a fierce Tone) to let my&s;elf be deceiv'd by your Wit, or Meta|morpho&s;is; No, Prince! you were here con|&s;piring again&s;t me; the rebellious Principles you were brought up in, cou'd never receive a grateful Sentiment, or teach you what you owe your Sovereign. Have I not pre&s;erv'd your Life, without regard to the Rea&s;ons of State, which ought to have induced me to &s;a|crifice you? Yet, ungrateful as you are! have you liv'd hitherto with the hopes of making
<PB N="283" REF="287">
me a Victim? Cruel <HI>I&s;mael</HI> al&s;o &s;econds your De&s;ign, and has promis'd you Forces in order to dethrone me. You prefer a Stranger to a Queen of your own Blood, to whom you owe every thing; but Heaven that protects me, has put me in a Condition to puni&s;h you, and be reveng'd of my Enemies. Satisfy your&s;elf, Madam, (reply'd the Prince, with a haughty Air) and don't &s;light &s;o fine an Opportunity of taking away a Life, which is odious to you. Paint my Innocence in the vile&s;t Colours, or rather, &s;ay, the legal Right I have to the Crown you wear, is my only Crime; and that, as you have ever born an invincible hatred to the unhappy Remainders of my Family, you have re&s;olv'd to compleat, what your unju&s;t Father had begun. Ra&s;h Man! cry'd <HI>Celima,</HI> do you think of what you are &s;aying? Dare you pronounce the&s;e Words before the Queen your Mi&s;tre&s;s? Don't you know your Death waits my Command? Is it thus you endeavour to ju&s;tify your &s;elf, and appea&s;e me? You don't con&s;ider the Danger you are in. <HI>Abelhamar</HI> made no Reply to her Threats, nor gave the lea&s;t Attention to her whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking, but rather acted like one, who de&s;pi&s;ing Mercy, did not regret the Life he was going to be depriv'd of; which unconcern'd Behaviour &s;ur|priz'd the Queen, who retired full of Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Celima</HI> had already given orders, that <HI>Feli|cia</HI> and <HI>Inea</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;trictly guarded in their Chambers, and that none of their Companions
<PB N="284" REF="288">
&s;hou'd be admitted to them. This new Misfor|tune did not add to <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Concern, for every thing was now become &s;o indifferent to her, that &s;he did not even enquire into the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen being return'd to the Palace, call'd her Council, and appointed Per&s;ons to examine the Prince, becau&s;e &s;he wou'd &s;hew &s;ome Form in an Affair, which might draw up|on her the Aver&s;ion of her Relations, and par|ticularly that of the <HI>Maliquez Alabez,</HI> who were al&s;o de&s;cended from the antient Kings of <HI>Fez,</HI> and at that time very potent in the King|dom of <HI>Granada.</HI> This induc'd her to give the blacke&s;t Colours to the Crime, with which they were going to charge <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> and tho' &s;he took the be&s;t Mea&s;ures to conceal the De&s;ign &s;he had again&s;t him, yet his faithful <HI>Mula</HI> (who was ju&s;t return'd from <HI>Tunis,</HI> where he had carry'd Credentials to <HI>I&s;mael</HI> from the Prince, us'd his utmo&s;t Application to &s;erve him; he had to good a Corre&s;pondence in the Palace, not to be inform'd of every thing that pa&s;s'd there, in relation to the unfortunate Prince; and as he perceiv'd the occa&s;ion was pre&s;&s;ing, he wou'd lo&s;e no time to give imme|diate a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his Ma&s;ter, who otherways wou'd fall a Sacrifice to <HI>Celima.</HI> He went to all <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Friends and Slaves, and pre|par'd them to a&s;&s;emble, in order to rai&s;e the City in his Favour; by which means, he hop|ed to re&s;tore him to his Liberty, or put all to Fire and Sword, that wou'd oppo&s;e it. The&s;e
<PB N="285" REF="289">
were his Re&s;olutions, till he reflected, that the Queen had a great many Creatures devoted to her Service, as well as a &s;trong Garri&s;on, and that the People being us'd to her Government, wou'd &s;trive to maintain it; therefore he thought it more prudent to return to <HI>Tunis,</HI> and apply him&s;elf to <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> who wou'd im|ploy his utmo&s;t Power in this important Affair; &s;o he &s;et out again from <HI>Sallee,</HI> and &s;oon ar|riv'd at <HI>I&s;mael</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>His Grief and Affection furni&s;h'd him with Expre&s;&s;ions of &s;o great a Force, that the King of <HI>Tunis</HI> was extreamly touch'd at <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Mis|fortunes, and being already exa&s;perated again&s;t <HI>Celima,</HI> he re&s;olv'd immediately to a&s;&s;i&s;t that Prince. With this Intent, he order'd his Troops to be drawn out of their Garri&s;ons and re|view'd, then &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> to renew his Treaty of Alliance with him, to prevent that Prince in his Ab&s;ence from making any Irruptions into his Territories.</P>
<P>After having di&s;pos'd every thing with as much Wi&s;dom as Diligence, he open'd the Campaign, and <HI>Mula</HI> return'd privately to <HI>Sallee,</HI> to perform what he had fir&s;t re&s;olv'd for the Safety of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The young Prince being examin'd, refus'd at fir&s;t to make a Reply; but when they told him, unle&s;s he an&s;wer'd to the Accu&s;ation, he &s;hou'd receive Sentence the &s;ooner, it oblig'd him to make a Defence, in Expectation of being reliev'd by <HI>I&s;mael;</HI> and whatever mind the Queen had to forward his Tryal, &s;he cou'd
<PB N="286" REF="290">
not proceed to a Condemnation, without ex|po&s;ing her&s;elf to inevitable Dangers. The fir&s;t Officers of the Crown, and Lords of the Court repre&s;ented to her, that &s;he cou'd not take too much Precaution in an Affair of this Importance, and that it wou'd be more to her Glory, to let Clemency take Place of Ju&s;tice; we believe the Prince is culpable, &s;aid they, &s;ince he was found di&s;guis'd in the Palace, which is a &s;ufficient Proof; yet without Re|gard to his Youth, as he is pre&s;umptive Heir to the Crown, and of your Blood, Madam, he ought to have &s;ome Re&s;pect &s;hewn him; therefore we beg, that your Maje&s;ty, for your own Intere&s;t, will con&s;ider the&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;e|parately, and by &s;u&s;pending your Re&s;entment, &s;hew Mercy to the Prince.</P>
<P>The Queen was di&s;pleas'd at a Reque&s;t, which &s;hew'd, that <HI>Abelhamar</HI> had more Friends than &s;he imagin'd; and fearing they &s;hou'd take Mea&s;ures to re&s;cue her Pri&s;oner, &s;he wou'd no longer con&s;ult Rea&s;on, but re|&s;olv'd to do every thing by her own Authority, without taking any Advice of her Council; &s;o having prevented tho&s;e appointed to judge the Prince, &s;he her&s;elf pronounc'd the Sentence of his Death; and to deter &s;editious Per&s;ons from caballing again&s;t her, &s;he order'd, that he &s;hou'd be executed on the Plat-Form of the Court wherein he was confin'd, that every Body might &s;ee him &s;uffer.</P>
<P>In this Place they built a Scaffold hung with Mourning, and &s;et round with Standards
<PB N="287" REF="291">
and Scutcheons, which with other di&s;mal Pre|parations drew Numbers of Spectators. The Prince was &s;oon after inform'd of his Fate; this News at fir&s;t very much &s;urpriz'd him; his Eyes expre&s;s'd an extraordinary Grief, and he was &s;ome time without &s;peaking; at la&s;t lifting up his Hands, Oh Heaven! he cry'd, you know my Di&s;gui&s;e was not criminal, and that this is only a pretext the unju&s;t Queen takes to de&s;troy me; but &s;ince you have de|creed my Doom, I am ready to obey without repining; and if <HI>Celima</HI> grants me one Favour, I &s;hall die with Content. Then turning him|&s;elf to the Captain of the Guards, he &s;aid, go tell the Queen from me, that I beg leave to bid an eternal Adieu to charming <HI>Felicia;</HI> the Minutes I &s;hall pa&s;s with her will be too &s;hort to retard the inhuman De&s;igns of <HI>Celima.</HI></P>
<P>The Officer went directly to the Queen, who was very unwilling to grant the Prince his Reque&s;t; but her Mini&s;ters having repre&s;ented to her in re&s;pectful Terms, how cruel it wou'd be to refu&s;e &s;o &s;mall a Satisfaction to a Per&s;on in his Condition, &s;he at la&s;t con&s;ented that <HI>Felicia</HI> &s;hou'd be brought to him. She was till then a Stranger to the Prince's Misfor|tune, being &s;trictly confin'd with <HI>Inea;</HI> and as her Confinement did not in the lea&s;t di&s;turb her, &s;he never enquired, why they added this new Rigour to her Captivity. Her Mind was entirely taken up with the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> and the Tears &s;he &s;hed were only for his In|con&s;tancy and Ab&s;ence; every thing el&s;e that
<PB N="288" REF="292">
happen'd, had no Effect on her; and &s;he was in this Di&s;po&s;ition, when &s;he was &s;ent for by the Queen's Orders. She follow'd the Gover|ne&s;s of the Slaves without asking any Que&s;ti|on; <HI>Inea</HI> &s;upported her, and being very weak after her Illne&s;s, it was with a va&s;t deal of Difficulty, that &s;he reach'd the Tower.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Object that &s;truck her Sight was the Scaffold, and a Number of Guards, which gave her room to believe, that &s;he was going to be a Victim to <HI>Celima</HI>'s Jealou&s;y. <HI>Inea</HI>'s Thoughts were the &s;ame, which extremely terrify'd her. <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Sentiments were diffe|rent from hers; for tho' Death appear'd hard to her, yet &s;he had &s;ome &s;ort of Satisfaction, in &s;eeing the approaching End of her Misfor|tunes. Take Courage, my dear <HI>Inea,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he, embracing her with a great deal of Ten|derne&s;s,) the Danger only regards me, and I look upon it with Indifferency; it is a Re|medy my Pre&s;ervation commanded me not to &s;eek, but &s;ince it is my Fate, I receive it with Plea&s;ure. I am going to die, and &s;hall no longer have a Sen&s;e of my Calamities. No, Lovely <HI>Felicia!</HI> (cry'd the Prince, who was near enough to hear what &s;he &s;aid,) you are not to die; this Puni&s;hment is prepar'd for un|fortune <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who now takes his la&s;t leave of you; I prote&s;t it le&s;s concerns me, to lo&s;e my Life in &s;o &s;hameful a manner, than to want A&s;&s;urances of your Favour. Ah Ma|dam! (added he with an Air full of Love and Grief) can you refu&s;e me a Look, a Sigh,
<PB N="289" REF="293">
or a favourable Word? You &s;ee I peri&s;h, and my Misfortune proceeds from your tran&s;cendent Charms! The De&s;ire I had to &s;ee you reign, made me endeavour to a&s;cend the Throne, from which my Father fell; you in&s;pir'd me with an Ambition, I &s;hou'd have manag'd better, had I been le&s;s in Love; You are the in|nocent Cau&s;e of the Di&s;gui&s;e I am reproach|ed with, which is thought my Crime; yet I have nothing to repent of, &s;ince my Pa&s;&s;ion invites me to bear the Cruelty of my Fate. But at lea&s;t, give me leave, divine <HI>Felicia,</HI> to believe that had my De&s;ign &s;ucceeded, my Re&s;pect and Per|&s;everance wou'd have made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on you. Only approve the&s;e Thoughts, and I &s;hall not think much to purcha&s;e &s;o dear a Profe&s;&s;ion, with the Lo&s;s of my Life.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia</HI> at the&s;e Words was &s;o di&s;order'd, that &s;he look'd &s;ome time at <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> with|out having Power to &s;peak. She was touch'd with a &s;incere Compa&s;&s;ion, and deplor'd the Misfortune of this young Prince, who was going to be &s;acrific'd &s;o ignominiou&s;ly. She cou'd have wi&s;h'd, the Queen's Re&s;entment had fallen on her; for the State of her Affairs with the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> was &s;uch, as had render'd Life &s;o in&s;upportable to her, that &s;he &s;eem'd very willing to re&s;ign it. At la&s;t, perceiving <HI>Abelhamar</HI> waited her An&s;wer; &s;he &s;aid, is this Scene prepar'd for you, my Lord? Alas! why cannot I relieve you? My Tears are the only Proofs, I can give of my true Concern; yet be a&s;&s;ured, I &s;hall never be
<PB N="290" REF="294">
&s;o ungrateful, as to forget your Favours. This Day's Di&s;a&s;ter will ever be before my Eyes. Ah <HI>Felicia!</HI> (reply'd the Prince) I thought your Compa&s;&s;ion wou'd have in&s;pired me with Courage, but I find it has a contrary Influence. Oh! That I cou'd now live for you. The Hopes you have given me, make me ex|treamly regret leaving you, &s;ince I mu&s;t leave you for ever. Here, his Brea&s;t was oppre&s;s'd with &s;o deep a Sorrow, that he cou'd only expre&s;s it by his repeated Sighs. The Queen, who was impatient to have the Prince exe|cuted, had order'd, that <HI>Felicia</HI> &s;hou'd be call'd away from him, when of a &s;udden &s;he was alarm'd, hearing at the Gates of the Palace, the Shouts and Cries of People in Arms, who were comanded by valiant <HI>Mula,</HI> and had al|ready charg'd the Soldiers of the Guard. They demanded the Prince, and threatned <HI>Celima</HI> with a general Revolt, unanimou&s;ly calling <HI>Abelhamar</HI> their King, and &s;aying, they had cau&s;e to fear a Queen, who was cruel enough to wa&s;h her Hands in the Blood of her neare&s;t Relation; and that if &s;he deny'd their Reque&s;t, they wou'd deliver her up to the Puni&s;hment, which &s;he had de&s;ign'd for the Prince.</P>
<P>The Queen wou'd not have given much Attention to the Menaces of the&s;e &s;editious Peo|ple, had &s;he not been inform'd, that there were thick Clouds of Du&s;t &s;een towards the Road of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and that the Centinels (who had already heard a confus'd Noi&s;e of warlike In&s;truments) began to di&s;cover from the Walls

of the Town, a Body of Men marching with great Precipitation; &s;oon after they came to acquaint her, that there was a Herald at the Gate, who de&s;ired Admittance to her Maje&s;ty, in the Name of <HI>I&s;mael.</HI> This News &s;truck the Queen with Terror, which &s;he expre&s;s'd by her Emotions, being divided between Re|venge and De&s;pair. Her Mini&s;ters pre&s;s'd her to give Audience to the King of <HI>Tituan</HI>'s Herald, and after being a little compos'd, &s;he con&s;ented to &s;ee him; he brought her a Letter, which was in the&s;e Terms.</P>

<P><HI>Celima</HI>'s Fortune cou'd hardly receive a great|er Change; &s;he now &s;aw at the Gates of her Capital an Enemy, who treated her like a Conqueror, that was ju&s;t going to dethrone her. The Soul of this imperious Prince&s;s grew &s;o furious at <HI>I&s;mael</HI>'s Menaces, that in&s;tead of thinking of the Danger &s;he was in, her Mind
<PB N="292" REF="296">
was only taken up with Revenge. Come, cry'd &s;he, Barbarian! Come and be Witne&s;s of my Courage and Re&s;entment; the Man you intend to redeem, &s;hall be &s;acrific'd before your Eyes. If Heaven and Earth &s;hou'd joyn, and the E|lements return to their fir&s;t Chaos; What is it to me? I have but a Life to lo&s;e, which has been a Burthen to me the&s;e many Years; let us go and &s;trike off this rebellious Head, which is &s;o dear to <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> and &s;end it to him from the Height of the Tower.

Ending the&s;e Words, &s;he went ha&s;tily towards the Place, where her Commands were only expect|ed for his Execution; but, the Mufty, the Admiral, and Governour of the Town, with &s;everal of her faithful Subjects, flung them|&s;elves at her Feet: Ala&s;s, Madam! &s;aid they, con&s;ider the Misfortune which &s;eems to point at you per&s;onally; are you re&s;olv'd to bury your &s;elf in the Ruins of the Palace? That mu&s;t certainly be your Fate, if you irritate a King, who is before your Walls with a potent Army; this is no time, Madam, to revenge your &s;elf; for in puting the Prince to Death, it may rai&s;e a Mutiny, and &s;hou'd <HI>I&s;mael</HI> take Advan|tage of it, you may lo&s;e your Life, or be|come Captive to the Conqueror.

by your Pre&s;ence, may re-place you on your Throne?</P>
<P>The Queen's Women in Tears, pro&s;trated them&s;elves at her Feet, and &s;aid all that Zeal and Fear cou'd in&s;pire; at la&s;t her imperious Heart was touch'd, rather at the Danger &s;he expos'd &s;o many Per&s;ons to, who depended on her, than at what concern'd her own Per&s;on.

I &s;hall become a Fugitive, and bani&s;h'd my Kingdom, be forc'd to beg Refuge of tho&s;e whom I once cou'd have protected; I cannot think I de&s;erve &s;o cruel a Fate.

<P>He was entertaining <HI>Felicia,</HI> when they came to tell him, that <HI>I&s;mael</HI>'s Ships and Forces were approaching. Think with what Tran|&s;ports he receiv'd this News! 'Tis now, Ma|dam, &s;aid he to her, that I can return the Goodne&s;s, you ju&s;t now expre&s;s'd; your Virtues have made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on me, and &s;ince I am deliver'd from Death, you &s;hall no lon|ger feel the Weight of your Chains. I re|joice, my Lord, reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> to &s;ee that the Danger is pa&s;t, and conjure you, not to give your &s;elf any Unea&s;ine&s;s about me: I am born to be unhappy, and the Rigour of my Captivity is nothing, when compar'd to my

inward Pain: Farewel, my Lord; you have now Affairs of greater Importance to imploy your Thoughts. Fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, &s;he retired, and <HI>Abelhamar</HI> remain'd in the Tower by Order of the Queen, who &s;ent Ho&s;tages to <HI>I&s;|mael,</HI> with A&s;&s;urances, that the Prince &s;hou'd be &s;et at Liberty, as &s;oon as &s;he had left the City.</P>
<P>Unfortunate <HI>Celima</HI> was now preparing a Fleet and Tran&s;ports to carry away her mo&s;t valuable Goods: She gave In&s;tructions to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom &s;he cou'd not take a|long with her, and having di&s;pos'd every Thing according to her Intention, &s;he made all ima|ginable Diligence to depart, not depending on <HI>I&s;mael</HI>'s Words, and fearing the Con&s;equences of <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Re&s;entment. Thus the Fugitive Queen went off by Night, with her Women and Slaves, and was conducted to the Ve&s;&s;el, which attended her. She order'd immediately to &s;et Sail with the re&s;t of the Fleet, and the Wind being fair, they &s;oon enter'd the <HI>Mediter|ranean.</HI> Nothing cou'd be equal to the Con|cern <HI>Celima</HI> was in for the lo&s;s of her King|dom; &s;he fetch'd deep Sighs, and in &s;pight of all her Pride, cou'd not re&s;train her Tears. For|tune! Ungrateful Fortune! &s;aid &s;he, your Ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s &s;pares neither King, nor Subject. Who can flatter him&s;elf with being above your Reach? You declar'd your &s;elf my Enemy from my Infancy, and pur&s;u'd me in the remote&s;t Countries. Once taken by a Pyrate, I fell into the Power of <HI>Bajazet;</HI> &s;oon after, you made u&s;e of <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Arrows to pierce my

Heart; Alas! that Wound, I never can hope to cure; at la&s;t, to &s;hew your &s;elf more favour|able, you plac'd me on a Throne, which you now force me to abandon. What mu&s;t I ex|pect from you next? Why don't you &s;trike me at once with your mo&s;t poi&s;on'd Darts, that I may not be expos'd to new Torments. Oh, deplorable Fate! &s;hall I thus be for ever per&s;ecuted? And you <HI>Felicia,</HI> (continued &s;he, ca&s;ting her melancholy Eyes on <HI>Leonida,</HI> who was near her) you are the Author of my la&s;t Misfortune; it is your fatal Beauty, that has been the occa&s;ion of this Revolution; Ah! how can you evince me, that you are inno|cent? Alas, Madam! reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> I had no Hand in the Prince's criminal De&s;igns; for if it be true, that he had a Pa&s;&s;ion for me, it was contrary to my Inclination: I knew nothing of his Di&s;gui&s;e; nor did I ever flatter him with any Hopes. On the contrary, my A|ver&s;ion was the only Return I made to his Addre&s;&s;es, and from the fir&s;t Hour he declar'd his Sentiments for me, I re&s;olv'd never to change. I was inform'd, &s;aid <HI>Celima,</HI> that the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> who came to fetch away <HI>Olympia,</HI> had given you much Unea&s;ine&s;s; with|out doubt, he is the Per&s;on you love, but you are convinc'd, he has no longer a Pa&s;&s;ion for you, and &s;ince he has no Regard to your Af|fection, you ought to di&s;dain him. The&s;e Words put <HI>Felicia</HI> into &s;ome Confu&s;ion, who blu&s;hing, ca&s;t down her Eyes, without being able to utter one Word, and her beauteous

Cheeks moi&s;ten'd with Tears &s;ufficiently ex|pre&s;s'd the State of her anxious Soul. You make me no An&s;wer (&s;aid <HI>Celima,</HI> fetching a Sigh) Ah!

Alas, <HI>Felicia!</HI> I know too well by fatal Experience, the irre&s;i&s;tible Power of Love, which unhappily &s;urpriz'd me before I cou'd &s;uppre&s;s its fir&s;t Motions, or even think how dangerous they might prove.</P>
<P>If there are Torments in Love, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> they ought not to affect a Sovereign, whom Nature hath grac'd with &s;uch tran&s;cen|dent Perfections. Nothing but Death, or Ab|&s;ence can deprive you of the Object that is dear to you. Incon&s;tancy, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es either in Cruelty, can never make you feel the tormenting Effects of it. Ah, <HI>Felicia!</HI> reply'd <HI>Celima,</HI> there is no Pain like that, which is occa&s;ion'd by Ab&s;ence, &s;ince it keeps us in continual Fears, both of Death and Infide|lity. At lea&s;t, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Felicia,</HI> there is one Comfort in it, which is, that having but an uncertain knowledge of the Truth, we are generally inclin'd to believe what we mo&s;t wi&s;h. No, continu'd <HI>Celima,</HI> it is not as you imagine; Uncertainty in Love is a Martyrdom, which adds to all the Pains we can endure. Alas, Madam! reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> I &s;hou'd now look on that uncertain State, as a happy one, &s;ince I might derive from it the plea&s;ing Hopes, which my pre&s;ent Condition entirely de&s;troys.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="301">
The Sovereign and her Charming Slave were entertaining each other with Di&s;cour&s;es of this Quality; and tho' <HI>Celima</HI>'s Familiarity was very great, yet <HI>Felicia</HI> was ever mindful of the Re&s;pect due to her. Night was far ad|vanc'd before they took any Re&s;t; but at la&s;t their Eyes yielded to what Nature required, and <HI>Celima</HI> had been a&s;leep &s;ome Hours, when &s;he was awak'd by the Noi&s;e of Seamen and Soldiers; the former were preparing again&s;t a Storm, which threaten'd 'em, and the latter for an Engagement with <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who&s;e Ships they had ju&s;t di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that as &s;oon as the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> had &s;et out for the Kingdom of <HI>Grana|da,</HI> the Gates of <HI>Sallee</HI> and the Palace were open'd to the King of <HI>Tituan,</HI> who immediate|ly went to the Tower, where the young Prince was Pri&s;oner; but the latter being already &s;et at Liberty, he came to meet the King with the greate&s;t Marks of Joy and Gratitude for his happy Deliverance. After <HI>Abelhamar</HI> had imploy'd &s;ome time, in giving the King as obliging a Reception, as that Juncture wou'd permit, he cou'd not forbear going to the A|partment which belong'd to the Queen's Slaves, thinking to find <HI>Felicia</HI> there; for tho&s;e who guarded him in his Confinement, had not inform'd him of her being embark'd with <HI>Ce|lima.</HI></P>
<P>But you may imagine how great was his Surprize, not to meet any Women there, and to &s;ee every thing in Di&s;order: This giving

him &s;ome Su&s;picion, he proceeded to the Queen's Apartments, which were open and quite empty, &s;o that he had no longer room to doubt of the lo&s;s of his <HI>Felicia.</HI> He ran up and down like a di&s;tracted Man, and expre&s;s'd his exce&s;&s;ive Grief in &s;uch Terms, as extreme|ly mov'd all that were with him. Have I then lo&s;t you, <HI>Felicia?</HI> cry'd he; my charming <HI>Fe|licia!</HI> have I lo&s;t you at a time, that I was flatter'd with the hopes of a perfect Felicity? The Compa&s;&s;ion you &s;hew'd for me, when I was expecting immediate Death, was an Evincement of the Di&s;po&s;ition you were in to do me Ju&s;tice, and had you not been compell'd to fly me, I am inclin'd to believe, you wou'd no longer refu&s;e me your Affection. But Oh! my <HI>Felicia,</HI> they have &s;natch'd you from me, and my raging Pa&s;&s;ion is the only thing I have left in your cruel Ab&s;ence. Go <HI>Mula,</HI> continu'd he, go tell the King, he has done nothing for me; I am ready to give him up that Life, which he has pre&s;erv'd, and I conjure him to take it from me, or re&s;tore me my Mi&s;tre&s;s; but what do I &s;ay? &s;he is not in his Power, then let him give me his Ships to pur&s;ue her.</P>
<P><HI>Mula</HI> obey'd his Commands, and went to <HI>I&s;|mael,</HI> whil&s;t &s;ome Per&s;ons, who remain'd with the Prince, were giving him an Account, with how much Precipitation the Queen went off, and that &s;he had &s;et Sail for the Kingdom of <HI>Granada. Abelhamar</HI> (who&s;e Impatience was great,) wou'd not wait <HI>Mula</HI>'s Return, but ran to <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> who readily granted him all he de|&s;ired;
<PB N="299" REF="303">
&s;o having cho&s;en &s;ome of the King's be&s;t Ships, and &s;wifte&s;t Sailers, he pur&s;u'd <HI>Celima,</HI> who&s;e Fleet he knew was neither con&s;iderable in Strength, or Number; tho' he did not re|flect that his Squadron was &s;till Inferior. Hav|ing put to Sea, he &s;tood on the Quarter-Deck, endeavouring to di&s;cover &s;ome of the Queen's Ships, when he &s;py'd a Ve&s;&s;el, not very di|&s;tant. He gave Orders they &s;hou'd make all Sail, which being executed, and the Wind fair, it was not long before he came up with her.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Object that pre&s;ented it &s;elf to him, was the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> for his and <HI>Olym|pia</HI>'s Sailing had been prevented by &s;tormy Weather, which forc'd 'em back; &s;o they cho&s;e to &s;tay on Shipboard, and remain in the Har|bour, where they waited a fair Opportunity of going on their Voyage. As &s;oon as <HI>Abel|hamar</HI> perceiv'd it was the Count, (whether he look'd on him as a Rival, who was the Occa|&s;ion that his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Felicia</HI> had not met with an obliging Return, or that he con&s;ider'd him as an Enemy to that lovely Captive, hav|ing behav'd him&s;elf towards her in an ungrate|ful and perfidious manner,) he cou'd not help conceiving &s;o immoderate an Aver&s;ion for him, that he in&s;tantly commanded <HI>Mula</HI> to take the Barge, and go to the Count of <HI>La Vagne.</HI> Tell him, &s;aid the Prince, that I look on him as a Traytor, who de&s;erves Death; and if he has a Mind to &s;ave Tho&s;e who are with him, and have nothing to interpo&s;e in our Quarrel, he may come to me, or give me his Word of
<PB N="300" REF="304">
Honour, and I will go and decide the Affair with him.</P>
<P><HI>Mula</HI> went on Board the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI>'s Ship, and tho' he was not acquainted with <HI>A|belhamar,</HI> whom he was &s;ure had no rea&s;ona|ble Motive to quarrel with him, yet he was &s;o offended, to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected being a Tray|tor, that without entering into a Detail, which might have made up the Difference, he leap'd into <HI>Mula</HI>'s Boat. I will go, (&s;aid he to him, with an Air full of Pride and Anger;) your Ma&s;ter &s;hall &s;ee, that &s;uch a Man as I is not to be in&s;ulted unreveng'd. Thus without re|flecting on the Danger to which he expos'd him&s;elf, and even forgetting his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, he order'd them to Row him to <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Ship.</P>
<P>The Boat had already made &s;ome Way, when <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Woman awak'd her, and gave her an Account of what was pa&s;&s;ing. Her Surprize was &s;o great, that &s;he ju&s;t gave her &s;elf Time to take her Night-Gown, then ran upon Deck, from whence, &s;he perceiv'd her Lover at a great Di&s;tance. Do you abandon me then, my dear Count, cry'd &s;he, and are you going to expo&s;e a Life, which is mine? What have you to &s;ay to cruel <HI>Abelhamar?</HI> Oh! don't leave me &s;o; but come back to your dear <HI>Olympia,</HI> or take me along with you, that I may undergo the &s;ame Fate. Whil&s;t &s;he was uttering the&s;e Words, the Count had reach'd <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Ship. <HI>Olympia</HI> &s;eeing this, de&s;ir'd the Captain of that &s;he was in, to let her take his Barge, which being grant|ed,
<PB N="301" REF="305">
&s;he bad them pull up with all Speed to|wards the Prince's Ship; but &s;he unfortunately arriv'd there too late: The Count was already engag'd with <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> and tho' he fought with all the Courage and Dexterity imaginable, he was forc'd at length to yield, having receiv|ed a mortal Wound.</P>
<P>As he was making his la&s;t Efforts to defend him&s;elf, again&s;t <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s reiterated Blows, the unhappy <HI>Olympia</HI> came up, and perceiving at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, that her Lover was cover'd with Blood, and hardly able to &s;upport him&s;elf, &s;he cry'd out in a loud Voice, hold, barbarous Prince! hold! What have I done to you, that &s;hou'd provoke you to deprive me of my Life? Don't you know that the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> is to be mine? Give &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ion to your Rage, (cruel as you are,) or if nothing but a Sacrifice will &s;atisfy you, I am here ready to receive the Blow; Come and pierce my Heart; but &s;pare! oh! &s;pare the Man I love!</P>
<P>The Accent of a Voice &s;o dear to the Count, reach'd him, ju&s;t as he fell at <HI>Abelhamar</HI>'s Feet. He &s;trove to rai&s;e his Head, and turning his Eyes towards <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Barge, he &s;aw his Di|vine Mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;pairing, who with much ado got on Board the Ship, and was no &s;ooner there, but fell in a Swoon near the Count, and remain'd Speechle&s;s a long while. After &s;he was a little recover'd, all &s;he cou'd do, was to lay her dying Lover's Head on her Knees, and bath his Wounds with her Tears: Thus op|pre&s;s'd with mortal Grief, &s;he &s;ate down with|out being able to complain.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="306">
The Count endeavour'd to &s;peak to her, and taking her by the Hand, &s;aid, I die, my dear <HI>Olympia,</HI> I die entirely yours, and regret de|parting from Life, only for your &s;ake. With the&s;e Words, his Soul took its Flight, and left his Body in the Arms of his deplorable Mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;aid &s;uch moving things, and acted &s;o much De&s;pair, that even <HI>Abelhamar</HI> was incon|&s;olable, for being the Author of her Afflicti|on. He &s;ent her half dead on Board the Ship, &s;he was in before, and order'd the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI>'s Corps to be al&s;o tran&s;ported. <HI>O|lympia,</HI> in&s;tead of going to <HI>Genoa,</HI> &s;ail'd for <HI>Sar|dinia,</HI> in order to retire to her Aunt's Mona&s;try, where (having erected a magnificent Tomb for her Lover) &s;he continu'd the re&s;t of her Days, lamenting the irreparable Lo&s;s &s;he had made. Thus we are often deceiv'd, when in the greate&s;t hopes of an approaching Happine&s;s, which Fortune changes into the cruele&s;t Torments.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> wou'd not have left <HI>Olympia</HI> in this de&s;olate Condition, had not his Pa&s;&s;ion invited him el&s;ewhere. He impatiently de&s;ir'd to overtake the Queen, being re&s;olv'd to force his <HI>Felicia</HI> from her; and he was not long in his Pur&s;uit, before they came to tell him, that they had di&s;cover'd <HI>Celima</HI>'s Ships. One may judge how extremely overjoy'd he was at this News. He immediately gave Orders to make all Sail, then imploying his Wi&s;hes for Succe&s;s and a fair Wind, prepar'd him&s;elf for an En|gagement with the Queen's Squadron, who were al&s;o doing the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="307">
This unfortunate Prince&s;s knowing the Dan|ger which threaten'd her, encourag'd her Peo|ple, and having &s;ent to all the Captains to come on Board her Ship, &s;he call'd a Council, then Orders were given, and each Officer thought of nothing but doing his Duty. The Trumpets began to &s;ound, and the Cannons roar'd, whil&s;t on each &s;ide they were endea|vouring to gain the Advantage of the Wind, with a Re&s;olution not to &s;hew any Favour. Thus ready for a Fight, <HI>Celima</HI> &s;aid to her Sol|diers, Ob&s;erve that dangerous Serpent (pointing at <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> who was in Armour walking on his Quarter-Deck) &s;ee that ungrateful Man, whom I brought up with &s;o much Care, he is now meditating my Ruin; did I not &s;pare his Life, tho' it ever endanger'd mine? yet he is not &s;atisfy'd with my quitting my Kingdom, to expo&s;e my&s;elf on this dangerous Element. He even pur&s;ues me, and &s;o greedily thir&s;ts after Blood, that nothing can plea&s;e him but my Death. Help me, ye brave and Loyal Sub|jects, to puni&s;h this Rebel, and let us by de|&s;troying him, afford an Example for other Traytors in Ages to come!</P>

I fear, we &s;hall once more be the Victims of Fortune: Oh, Heaven! cry'd &s;he, rather let me die, than fall into the Hands of <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> &s;ince no greater Di&s;a&s;ter can ever happen to me.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="308">
<HI>Inea</HI> endeavour'd to comfort and give her hopes, &s;aying, why do you thus afflict your &s;elf, &s;ince nothing is yet decided? We are all pre|paring for a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, and the Wea|ther begins to be &s;o Stormy, that one wou'd almo&s;t believe it impo&s;&s;ible for the two Fleets to approach.

<P>Thus the Fleets were di&s;pers'd without knowing which way to &s;teer their Cour&s;e. The raging Wind rent the Sails and &s;plit the Ma&s;ts, and the artle&s;s Pilot, with Death in his Looks, was torn from his Helm: The impe|tuous Waves to&s;s'd the Ships here, and there, till at la&s;t, unable to with&s;tand their re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Fury, &s;ome were da&s;h'd again&s;t the Rocks, o|thers wreck'd on the Shoar, and few e&s;cap'd this terrible Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> (having lo&s;t Sight of the Ship wherein he thought <HI>Felicia,</HI> and de&s;pairing of ever &s;eeing her more) look'd on the Danger he was in, with &s;ome kind of Satisfaction. No, (&s;aid he to <HI>Mula,</HI> who made un&s;uccesful Efforts to con&s;ole his Ma&s;ter) no, &s;hou'd I e&s;cape Death, which now threatens me, you mu&s;t not think, that I can ever enjoy any Plea&s;ure, or Happine&s;s, without the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Felicia:</HI> My Pa&s;&s;ion for her increa&s;es more and more,

<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> was mortally di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee, that the pre&s;ent Conjuncture oblig'd him to return to <HI>Fez;</HI> and what added to his Afflicti|on in his way thither, was to meet on every &s;ide the di&s;mal Fragments of Ship-wracks, which cover'd the Surface of the Sea, and made him but too &s;en&s;ible, that he had lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his Fleet.</P>
<P>The Queen, on her &s;ide, had not been ex|pos'd to le&s;&s;er Dangers, for all her Fleet was di&s;pers'd; and as the Wind drove her into the Port of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> the &s;tern of her Ship &s;truck &s;o fiercely again&s;t another, that they both had like to have &s;unk, which Accident &s;hat|ter'd what the Storm had &s;par'd; but &s;everal Boats and Barges came immediately to the Queen's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and landed her &s;afe with her Women and Equipage.</P>
<P>She had hardly &s;tep'd out of her Barge, but was inform'd of the great Alterations which had happen'd in the Kingdom of <HI>Grana|da,</HI> by the Death of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who (being poi&s;on'd by the means of a Gown, which was &s;ent to him as a Pre&s;ent) had left the Crown to his Brother <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> whom he had detain'd Pri&s;oner many Years in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salobrena.

<P>The Governour of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> hearing that the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> was landed, went to meet her with all the Marks of Honour and Re|&s;pect, that were due to her Quality.

The&s;e Princes were perfectly accompli&s;h'd; and as the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had been confin'd by the late King's Orders, in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salobrena,</HI> whil&s;t they were Pri&s;oners there, they had con|ceiv'd &s;o entire a Friend&s;hip for him, that they re&s;olv'd to &s;et him at Liberty, if ever their Condition &s;hou'd change; but the King their Father, being de&s;irous to make Peace with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and knowing that the Infanta, Don <HI>Fernand,</HI> had offer'd <HI>Mahomet</HI> a con&s;ider|able Ran&s;on for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> (for he continu'd calling him&s;elf by that Title)
<PB N="308" REF="312">
thought, that in detaining him, it might be a more effectual means to obtain what he &s;o ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;h'd. Neverthele&s;s, as he had a par|ticular E&s;teem for the Prince, he ask'd him if he wou'd give him his Honour, not to go a|way without his Con&s;ent; which the other having readily promis'd, the King took him along with him to <HI>Granada.</HI></P>
<P>The Day he made his Entry, he &s;ent the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> a magnificent Dre&s;s, with a rich Turbant and a Scymiter embelli&s;h'd with Jewels, which &s;hew'd it was the King's plea|&s;ure he &s;hou'd dre&s;s him&s;elf after the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> manner, in order to accompany him to all the Solemnities of his Coronation.</P>
<P>But the King, who had found in the Prince a great Re&s;emblance of the brave <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> (who was a Grandee of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Aban&s;erages,</HI> much con&s;ider'd in that Kingdom, and had been lately kill'd) us'd often to give the Prince that Name, out of a Mark of Favour, who equally receiv'd it as &s;uch; and as he was un|willing to be known, he cho&s;e rather to be called by that Name, than any other.</P>
<P>Tho' time had not been able to dimini&s;h the Prince's Pa&s;&s;ion, or alleviate his Grief, yet in &s;pite of his exce&s;&s;ive Melancholy, every Body di&s;tingui&s;h'd him, as one of the fine&s;t Gentlemen, that was ever known. Among&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hew'd him the greate&s;t marks of E&s;teem, the Princes <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>O&s;min</HI> parti|cularly expre&s;s'd them&s;elves his Friends. <HI>Ma|homet</HI> had eminent Qualities, but was &s;o pre|&s;umptuous,
<PB N="309" REF="313">
that he wou'd have &s;acrific'd any thing to gratify his De&s;ires. His younger Bro|ther, <HI>O&s;min,</HI> was as fine a Prince, and had no|bler Inclinations, which made the King have a greater Affection for him, than for the re&s;t of his Children.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as News was brought of <HI>Celima</HI>'s being near <HI>Granada,</HI> the&s;e two Princes (by the King their Father's Order, at the Head of the Noblemen of that Court) went out of Town to meet the Queen. The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was one of tho&s;e, who accompany'd them in this Cavalcade, and each Cavalier had a Motto painted on his Shield: The Prince caus'd an <HI>Apollo</HI> pur&s;uing <HI>Daphne,</HI> to be drawn on his, with the&s;e Words round it, written in <HI>Spani&s;h, Quiero y bu&s;co quien me aborece y me fuyo;</HI> that is, I love and pur&s;ue one, who hates and flies me. This Thought expre&s;s'd in a gallant Manner his di&s;appointed Pa&s;&s;ion. The Princes under&s;tood it immediately, for whil&s;t they were in Confinement together, he told 'em part of his Adventures, and made a Secret only of his and his Mi&s;tre&s;s's true Name, which he con|ceal'd for &s;everal political Rea&s;ons, e&s;pecially on his Brother, and <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI>'s Ac|count, who had both fought again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> and defeated them in &s;everal Engagements.</P>
<P>So many Hi&s;torians have inform'd the World, how highly the <HI>Moors,</HI> in tho&s;e Days, di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd them&s;elves above other Nations, by their Gallantry and Magnificence, that I &s;hall decline extending that Subject, and only &s;ay,
<PB N="310" REF="314">
that the unfortunate, but beauteous, Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> elected that Court for her Refuge, where &s;he appear'd with &s;uch Attractives, as in&s;pir'd Love in all, who beheld her.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Brother (accompany'd by the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> in his <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, which admirably became him) met the Queen at a &s;mall di&s;tance from <HI>Granada.</HI> She &s;ate a|lone in a fine open Chariot, and all her Women follow'd her in Chai&s;es. <HI>Felicia</HI> and <HI>Inea</HI> were together in one, and had drawn the Curtains, to have an Opportunity of entertaining each other more conveniently. Ought we to look on our being near <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Felicia</HI> to her Friend, as a favourable Change towards our better Fortune? I think, reply'd <HI>Inea,</HI> that the Circum&s;tances can no ways prove to our Di&s;|advantage. Alas! as for my part, interrupted <HI>Felicia,</HI> I have &s;o little hopes of Happine&s;s in this Life, that I cou'd now leave the World with Plea&s;ure. <HI>Inea</HI> did not omit any thing, which cou'd divert her from the&s;e melancholy Reflecti|ons, tho' &s;he her&s;elf had cau&s;e enough to be un|ea&s;y, not having heard from her dear <HI>Don Ra|mire.</HI> Whil&s;t they were talking, the Princes alighted, and &s;aluted the Queen with ma|ny A&s;&s;urances in the Name of the King their Father; then took Hor&s;e again, and rode by the &s;ide of her Chariot, entertaining her Maje&s;ty, with what was mo&s;t &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion of her Voyage. But <HI>Celima</HI> became of a &s;udden &s;o pen&s;ive, that &s;he cou'd hardly make 'em any An&s;wer; her Eyes were entire|ly
<PB N="311" REF="315">
fix'd on the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> and &s;he had not Power to turn them on any other Object: Her Joy and Surprize were equally extraordi|nary, and what added to both, was &s;eeing him in a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, which gave her a Curio&s;i|ty to ask his Name of one of the Guards, that was near her, who (not knowing, that the Prince was a Pri&s;oner of War, but had on|ly &s;een him with the King, in his Journey from <HI>Salobrena</HI> to <HI>Granada,)</HI> told the Queen he was call'd <HI>A&s;&s;imir.</HI></P>
<P>She immediately conjectur'd, he had &s;ome important Rea&s;ons, which oblig'd him to a&s;|&s;ume that Name, and Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;o did not ask any other Que&s;tions relating to him; yet what gave her &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, was to find that he did not take any particular Notice of her. She was a good while in Expectation he wou'd have &s;poken to her; at la&s;t &s;eeing he continu'd Silent, &s;he addre&s;s'd her Di&s;cour&s;e to him, and for a pretence ask'd him the Sig|nification of the Motto, which &s;he had per|ceiv'd on his Shield. He told her the Mean|ing, and added, that he was the unhappie&s;t Man in the World. The Queen imagin'd, that by the <HI>Apollo,</HI> he meant him&s;elf; and <HI>Daph|ne</HI> to be her, which fill'd her Mind with &s;uch Ideas, as were too plea&s;ing to be expre&s;s'd. I have &s;ometimes had a Prophetick Spirit (&s;aid &s;he to him &s;miling) and have foretold things without knowing their true Cau&s;e: Methinks I have a great Di&s;po&s;ition to do you the &s;ame Favour, <HI>A&s;&s;imir!</HI> Your <HI>Daphne</HI> neither flies,
<PB N="312" REF="316">
nor hates you, and you &s;hall &s;oon have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing her. Ah, Madam! cry'd the Prince tran&s;ported, what do you tell me? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the cruel fair One, who is the Object of my Sufferings, will at la&s;t vouch|&s;afe to make me happy? Yes, (reply'd <HI>Celima,</HI> with a gracious Air) &s;he is as willing as you, to put a period to your Torments, and I promi&s;e you, that as &s;oon as I am a little at Lei|&s;ure, I will tell you more of the matter. Alas, Madam! reply'd he, I do not de&s;erve, that &s;o great a Queen &s;hou'd be concern'd in my For|tune, which hitherto has prov'd very fatal, and I dare hardly hope a better one for the future. <HI>Celima</HI> &s;aid no more to him at that time, fearing the particular Di&s;tinction, &s;he had &s;hewn him, might be taken Notice of, which undoubtedly wou'd have di&s;oblig'd <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> who had already found &s;o many Charms in the Queen, that he cou'd not &s;ufficiently deplore her Misfortunes; and whil&s;t he was thus offering her his Pity, a more powerful Pa&s;&s;ion made way to his Heart.</P>
<P>The nearer <HI>Celima</HI> approach'd <HI>Granada,</HI> the more &s;he admired the Beauty of that famous City, which is &s;ituated in a Plain, at the Ex|tremity whereof is a &s;nowy Hill, from whence &s;pring two Rivers, the <HI>Daro,</HI> and <HI>Genil;</HI> the one often produces Gold-Du&s;t, mix'd with the Sand, and the other pure Silver. The Air of that Climate is &s;weet, and refin'd, and there &s;eldom appears any Winter; the Spring and Autumn united, afford Flowers and Fruit,
<PB N="313" REF="317">
without being at the trouble of cultivating the Earth. There are whole Fore&s;ts of Orange, Mirtle, and Pomgranate Trees; and as Nature had taken Care to embelli&s;h the Country, &s;o no Art had been &s;par'd to beautify the City, which was incompa&s;s'd with a &s;trong Wall, and Twelve Hundred Towers. The Palace of <HI>Al|hambro</HI> (which the Kings had cho&s;en for their Court) was &s;o magnificent, that nothing but the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abbaycin</HI> cou'd be equal to it, which on every &s;ide &s;hin'd with Gold and Azure, &s;upported by Marble and Porphyry; be&s;ides, the <HI>Moors</HI> ob&s;erv'd an admirable Order in Architecture, which highly recommended their Buildings; and as for their Gardens, Walks and Fountains, they were &s;o wonder|fully well contriv'd, that nothing cou'd be added to their Beauty and Agreeablene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Queen arriv'd at the Gates of the Town, where the People a&s;&s;embled in great Multi|tudes: But the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> to avoid the Crowd, took another way, which in&s;en&s;ibly led him to the &s;ide of the River <HI>Daro,</HI> whence he continued till he came to a Fountain, who&s;e Water was as clear as Cry&s;tal; the deep Silence, which reign'd in that Place, and the Inclinati|on he had to meditate on what the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> had &s;aid to him, invited him to alight; he ty'd his Hor&s;e to a Tree, and lay down on the Gra&s;s; then calling to mind what <HI>Celima</HI> had told him, by what Chance, thought he, did this Prince&s;s (who never &s;aw me before) &s;ingle me out to acquaint me, that <HI>Leonida</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="318">
&s;till loves me, and that I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee her. Has any one inform'd her of my Sentiments? Methinks it does not well become one of her Rank, to rally an unfortunate Man, who can|not even flatter him&s;elf with Hopes, much le&s;s with the real Enjoyment of &s;o unexpected a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>He was drown'd in Reflections of this Na|ture, when the Voice of a Man, (who &s;poke the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue) interrupted him, asking whe|ther the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> was yet arriv'd at <HI>Gra|nada?</HI> The Prince knew very well, that the Per&s;on who was coming up to him was a Stranger, and that he only &s;poke <HI>Arabick</HI> to him, becau&s;e of his Dre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be &s;ome Grandee in Alliance with the <HI>Moors.</HI> He fix'd his Eyes on this Foreigner, but Heavens! how great was their &s;urprize, when they knew each other. <HI>Benavidez</HI> (for it was he) cou'd not help turning pale at the thoughts of his Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and the Prince, &s;welling with Anger, &s;aid to him, From whence come you, un|worthy Wretch that you are? What <HI>Doemon</HI> has convey'd you here to receive the Puni&s;hment of of your Treacheries? Fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, he drew his Sword, and us'd it with &s;uch Fiercene&s;s, that the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Bravery, was daunted and &s;eiz'd with Ter|rour; till at la&s;t, calling De&s;pair to his Succour, and &s;eeing the inevitable Danger he was in, he fought rather like a de&s;perate Man, than one who had a mind to &s;ave his Life. The Prince, re&s;olving not to &s;pare him, reiterated his Blows
<PB N="315" REF="319">
with &s;uch Vigour, that he &s;oon gave <HI>Benavi|dez</HI> a mortal Wound, which made him fall at his Feet. Ah! my Lord (&s;aid he to the Prince, with a feeble and incoherent Accent) it is but ju&s;t, I &s;hou'd die by your Hand, after all the Injuries I have done you. Did I de&s;erve &s;uch U&s;age, Traitor, reply'd the Prince? Since you can deceive me no longer, where have you left perfidious <HI>Leonida?</HI> Now is the time to con|vince me, that you are yet capable of repent|ing a ba&s;e Action. I am willing to obey you, (an&s;wer'd <HI>Benavidez,</HI> &s;tretching out his Hand) upon Condition, that you will forgive me. Speak, and I will even forget all, &s;aid the Prince; tell me what is become of my <HI>Leoni|da.</HI> I declare to you (reply'd <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who&s;e Face &s;hew'd the Symptoms of an approaching Death) that <HI>Leonida</HI> never ceas'd loving you; &s;he no ways con&s;ented to her Flight, but al|mo&s;t con&s;um'd with Grief, loaded me with the cruelle&s;t Reproaches, and her utmo&s;t Aver&s;ion was the only return &s;he made my Pa&s;&s;ion; yet in &s;pite of her Tears and Re&s;i&s;tance, I took her with me on Board a Ship, and was promi&s;ing my&s;elf a happy Voyage, when we were met by &s;ome of the Enemy's Ships, who engag'd, and took ours: I was &s;o dangerou&s;ly wound|ed, that&mdash;Farewel, my Lord; I can &s;ay no more, I am dying. His Eyes in&s;tantly clos'd, and his Soul made its Exit, whil&s;t he was ly|ing in the Prince's Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Death touch'd the Prince of <HI>Ca|rency</HI>'s generous Soul, who forgetting all his
<PB N="316" REF="320">
Ingratitude, began to pity him, &s;aying, that he wou'd never have been guilty of the Crimes he had committed, cou'd he have de|fended his Heart from <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Charms; and looking on him as an unhappy Rival, and a reconciled Enemy, his Compa&s;&s;ion took Place of his Re&s;entment: He reflected on what <HI>Bena|videz</HI> had ju&s;t told him, relating to his dear <HI>Le|onida,</HI> but he was perfectly incon&s;olable, not knowing the Enemies, who had taken her. Fatal Death! cry'd he, thou ha&s;t &s;natch'd away the Life of a Man, who was going to in|form me of a Circum&s;tance, which is of the greate&s;t Importance to me. Where mu&s;t I fly to &s;eek the Object of my Love, and how can I tell into who&s;e Hands &s;he is fallen? Oh Heavens! am I not more unfortunate than ever? The Thoughts of her being incon&s;tant, gave &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ion to my Pa&s;&s;ion, for which I was endeavouring to find a Cure; but now the Ca&s;e is chang'd; I am concern'd for a Mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom I am contracted; &s;he has ever been true to me, and perhaps, has found a Lover and a Ma&s;ter, in the Man who has her now in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Oh unparallel'd Fatality! How tormenting will the&s;e Appre|hen&s;ions be to my afflicted Soul? Which way &s;hall I go to find her? The Prince was &s;o deeply involv'd in the&s;e anxious Reflections, that he did not immediately perceive a Wound he had receiv'd in his Arm; but finding him&s;elf grow weak by the great Lo&s;s of Blood, he thought fit to retire.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="321">
Ju&s;t as he enter'd the Town, he met <HI>Zulema,</HI> who was a <HI>Moor</HI> of the Family of <HI>Aben&s;erages,</HI> to who&s;e Guard he had been committed by Orders of the late King, whil&s;t he was Pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salobrena.</HI> The Prince having a Con|fidence in this <HI>Moor,</HI> thought he cou'd not chu&s;e any one more capable of ordering <HI>Bena|videz</HI>'s Burial; therefore he de&s;ired <HI>Zulema</HI> to oblige him in this Occa&s;ion, who without delay, tho' the Night was far &s;pent, took &s;ome Slaves with him, and went to the Fountain, in order to execute the Prince's Commands.</P>
<P>As he came near the Place, he heard a Per|&s;on lamenting grievou&s;ly, which at fir&s;t &s;ur|priz'd him, not di&s;tingui&s;hing what he &s;aid; but having alighted from his Hor&s;e, he per|ceiv'd a Man, who was embracing <HI>Beavi|dez</HI>'s Body, and bemoaning his Misfortune in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue. Ah! my dear <HI>Benavidez,</HI> &s;aid he, how unlucky it is, that I was not here to defend you again&s;t the Traitors, who have murder'd you. Alas! my Unea&s;ine&s;s and Fears had already foretold your Death. Here <HI>Zulema</HI> interrupted this Stranger, and being compa&s;&s;ionate, told him, <HI>Benavidez</HI> had not been kill'd by any treacherous means; and that he, who fought him, was &s;o generous an Enemy, that he had even de&s;ir'd him to come and &s;ee the Corps interr'd. The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was very young, expre&s;s'd his Concern by his Tears, and &s;aid, Oh Sir! Nothing can alle|viate my Affliction, &s;ince I have lo&s;t all, in lo&s;ing my dear Ma&s;ter. <HI>Zulema</HI> endeavour'd
<PB N="318" REF="322">
to comfort him, then order'd his People to take the Corps, and bury it in a little Wood, not far from the Fountain.</P>
<P>This being perform'd, <HI>Zulema</HI> (who was na|turally generous, and then mov'd with Pity at the repeated Complaints of this Servant of <HI>Benavidez)</HI> ask'd him, if he wou'd go along with him to <HI>Granada.</HI> You &s;hall be &s;afe in my Hou&s;e, &s;aid he, which is a Favour your Countrymen cannot well expect in this King|dom. Don <HI>Sanche</HI> (for that was the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Name,) he&s;itated &s;ome time before he made an An&s;wer, but at la&s;t, whether Fear or Prudence prevail'd with him, he told <HI>Zulema,</HI> that &s;ince he was pleas'd to offer him his Hou&s;e for a Sanctuary, he was very willing to wait on him. <HI>Zulema,</HI> who was unea&s;y about the Prince's Wound, went directly to &s;ee him, and the mean while &s;ent the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to his Hou&s;e, to wait his return.</P>
<P>The Prince was in Bed, and the Surgeon, who had dre&s;s'd his Wound, found it &s;ome|what dangerous, which &s;oon occa&s;ion'd a Re|port in the Town, that he had had a Rencounter, tho' the Particulars were not known; and when <HI>Zulema</HI> enter'd the Prince's Chamber, he found the King's two Sons &s;itting by him, who were much concern'd at this Accident. <HI>Mahomet</HI> thus continued the Di&s;cour&s;e he had already begun; I mu&s;t tell you, it is unkind, to make a My&s;tery to us of your Enemy's Name. I owe you, my Lord, reply'd the Prince, too much Gratitude and Affection, ever to do that
<PB N="319" REF="323">
which might de&s;erve a Reproach from you; I &s;hou'd be very willing to tell you who was my Enemy, if there were Cau&s;e to apprehend any farther Con&s;equences, but I am entirely ea&s;y on that Score; be&s;ides, I am oblig'd to keep a Secret, which I was &s;worn to, before I thought you wou'd have ask'd me the Detail of this Affair, &s;o beg leave to be &s;i|lent.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;min</HI> fearing this Conver&s;ation might create &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Prince, obligingly wav'd the Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aid to him; You have lo&s;t very much by not attending the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> for (laying a&s;ide the honoura|ble Reception the King my Father gave her, and the extraordinary Lu&s;tre which the Ladies of our Court appear'd in) &s;he commanded all her Slaves to pull off their Veils, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, we were both a&s;toni&s;h'd, and charm'd, to &s;ee &s;o many beautiful Creatures.

Alas, my Lord! interrupted the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> perhaps your Time is not come, but you will find your &s;elf as &s;en&s;ible as any of us, when you meet with the Object, whom De&s;tiny has decreed to in&s;pire you.

Who can tell, my Lord, &s;aid the Prince, whether that Slave will like the Man, who has a Pa&s;&s;ion for her?

Every one mu&s;t agree, that <HI>Celima</HI> is endow'd with too many Excellencies, to apprehend any thing from other Beauties. Ha, Brother! &s;aid <HI>O&s;min;</HI> you were boa&s;ting a while ago of your In&s;en&s;ibility, but I find by the pa&s;&s;ionate Air, with which you expre&s;s your&s;elf in the Queen's Defence, that you are not &s;o very indifferent, as you wou'd make us believe. <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who had no mind to &s;a|tisfy his Brother on that Subject, made no Reply, but ri&s;ing up, addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to <HI>A&s;|&s;imir,</HI> (meaning the Prince of <HI>Carency)</HI> whom he embrac'd; and after having de&s;ir'd him to take Care of his Health, he and his Brother took their leave of him. <HI>Zulema</HI> retir'd at the &s;ame time, without acquainting him, that
<PB N="322" REF="326">
he had met <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Servant. The Prince on the other Hand was impatient to entertain him, but there was no po&s;&s;ibility of doing it, till the next Day.</P>
<P>One may imagine, the Prince pa&s;s'd but a very ill Night. What the Queen and <HI>Bena|videz</HI> had &s;aid to him, &s;trangely perplex'd his Mind, which, being added to the Pain he &s;uffer'd by his Wound, threw him before Morning into a violent Feaver. <HI>Zulema,</HI> who had a particular Concern for the Prince, ro&s;e early, and went to enquire after his Health; they told him he had not repos'd all Night, and if he pleas'd, might go into his Chamber. As &s;oon as the Prince perceiv'd him; Ah my dear <HI>Zu|lema!</HI> &s;aid he, I was wi&s;hing to &s;ee you: All that pa&s;s'd Ye&s;terday, has put me into &s;uch a di&s;order, as I &s;hall not be able to overcome, without your A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> &s;poke to me, as if &s;he knew me, and I remark'd in her Air and Eyes, &s;omething more obliging, than is u&s;ually expre&s;s'd for a Per&s;on one has never &s;een; be&s;ides, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, that my Mi&s;tre&s;s neither flies, nor hates me, and that I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her &s;oon. Who cou'd have inform'd her of a thing &s;o po&s;itive? I &s;hou'd be inclin'd to think, that Chance was the only Cau&s;e why &s;he enter|tain'd me &s;o agreeably, were it not for the Ren|counter I had Ye&s;terday near the Fountain. He whom I fought was my Rival, the &s;ame <HI>Benavidez,</HI> who carry'd off my <HI>Felicia:</HI> He told me with his la&s;t Breath, &s;he had ever lov'd me,
<PB N="323" REF="327">
and that her Sentiments for me were &s;till the &s;ame; it is not probable, he wou'd have utter'd an untruth, in &s;o di&s;mal a Condition. But ju&s;t as he was going to tell me where he had left her, he was depriv'd both of his Speech and Life. You cannot imagine, how this grieves my Soul; <HI>Felicia</HI> loves me, can any Happine&s;s be greater? Yet Alas! I have lo&s;t her, and know not where to enquire after her: What Mis|fortune can be equal to mine? Here he was &s;ome time &s;ilent.</P>
<P><HI>Zulema</HI> told him, that a more favourable Fortune wou'd certainly di&s;clo&s;e a Secret, on which depended his Felicity; and that he did not doubt, but he might receive &s;ome Infor|mation from a young Man, he found weeping near <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Body, whom he had detain'd at his Hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e. Oh! I conjure you, &s;end for him immediately, cry'd the Prince; I remember, his Ma&s;ter in approach|ing me, ask'd whether the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> was yet arriv'd at <HI>Granada;</HI> perhaps &s;he knew him, and that in relating his Adventures to her, he mention'd &s;omething concerning mine. I ought not to neglect any means in my pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances; for if that young Man was with <HI>Benavidez,</HI> when he ran away with my Mi&s;|tre&s;s, and can tell me what is become of her, I &s;hall be ble&s;s'd above Mankind.</P>
<P>I perceive &s;o great an Emotion in you, my Lord, reply'd <HI>Zulema,</HI> that I am &s;orry for hav|ing acquainted you with a Particular, which may be prejudicial to your Health. No, &s;aid
<PB N="324" REF="328">
the Prince, do not fear any thing; but if you have either Love, or Pity, relieve me in this urgent Occa&s;ion. Shall I tell you then what I was thinking, an&s;wer'd <HI>Zulema? O&s;min</HI> &s;poke to you Ye&s;terday very much in Prai&s;e of one <HI>Felicia,</HI> who is a Slave of <HI>Celima</HI>'s; it is pro|bable &s;he may be the Per&s;on you love. I be|gan to &s;u&s;pect the &s;ame, interrupted the Prince, but was not willing to harbour &s;uch a Thought; for there are many <HI>Felicias</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and after the Adventure I had at <HI>Jaen</HI> with Don <HI>Alon&s;o</HI> by a Mi&s;take, which that Name occa&s;ion'd, I have room to fear the like Di&s;appointment; I only beg you will &s;end for the young Man, you &s;poke of.</P>
<P><HI>Zulema</HI> commanded one of his Slaves, in whom he confided, to give a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and bring him immediately along with him: This was the Precaution he us'd to prevent his being taken at <HI>Granada</HI> for a Sranger. Don <HI>Sanche</HI> was a little unwilling at fir&s;t, to go out of <HI>Zulema</HI>'s Hou&s;e, not know|ing where they intended to carry him; but the Slave having told him, they were going to an intimate Friend of his Ma&s;ter's, who&s;e Name was <HI>A&s;&s;imir,</HI> he readily follow'd him, believing <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> was a <HI>Moor;</HI> and he continu|ed in the &s;ame Opinion, even when he enter'd the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI>'s Chamber, who was in Bed, and the Windows clos'd. Come nearer Don <HI>Sanche,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Zulema</HI> to him, and tell us &s;incerely, what you know concerning <HI>Felicia</HI> of <HI>Leon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="329">
This unexpected Que&s;tion &s;urpriz'd the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> who was &s;ome time without making any An&s;wer. What! &s;aid the Prince, do you he&s;itate? Tell me immediately what is become of her. Were you not with your Ma&s;ter, when he car|ry'd her away? Heavens! What new A&s;toni&s;h|ment did this Voice create! Don <HI>Sanche,</HI> or (to explain my&s;elf in a clearer manner) <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> Si&s;ter to <HI>Benavidez,</HI> (for it was &s;he, who was thus di&s;guis'd) was &s;uddenly &s;truck with &s;uch a violent Trembling, that had not the Cham|ber been very dark, it wou'd have been im|po&s;&s;ible to conceal her Di&s;order: Her Eyes were endeavouring to &s;ee the Per&s;on whom her Heart already knew, whil&s;t the Prince on his &s;ide, was in the utmo&s;t Impatience to be inform'd of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Fate. What (&s;aid &s;he to her &s;elf) &s;hall my Rival for ever be ador'd, and cou'd her Ab&s;ence no ways extingui&s;h the Prince's Pa&s;&s;ion? Was ever Misfortune equal to mine? Then re&s;olving at once, not to menti|on any thing, which might di&s;cover <HI>Leonida</HI>'s being with the Queen of <HI>Fez;</HI> 'tis true, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, I was with Don <HI>Fernand Bena|videz,</HI> when he ran away with the fair Lady you nam'd, and we &s;hou'd have had a pro&s;perous Voyage, were it not for the fatal Rencounter of two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ships, who engag'd ours, and took it, my Ma&s;ter being the only Man, that re&s;i&s;ted with undaunted Courage. The Captains of the&s;e Ships were &s;o charm'd with <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Beauty, which had receiv'd no Injury from her Affliction, that they re&s;olv'd to carry
<PB N="326" REF="330">
her to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in order to pre&s;ent her to the Grand Seignior; therefore having given her a very Rich Dre&s;s, they brought her to that Emperour, who was &s;o mightily taken with her, that he immediately plac'd her in his <HI>Seraglio.</HI> As for my Ma&s;ter and I, good Fortune wou'd have it that we were &s;old to the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Morea,</HI> who knew Don <HI>Fernand Benavidez,</HI> to whom he was indebted for &s;ome con&s;iderable Service, he had render'd him in <HI>Spain.</HI> This <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> was a famous Renegado, which was his only Crime; for he was very generous, and &s;o grateful, that he re&s;tor'd us to our Liberty without requiring any Ran&s;om. Thus we return'd to <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> where we were ju&s;t landed, when my Ma&s;ter heard that the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> was coming to <HI>Granada,</HI> which deter|min'd him to come hither, in order to pay his Court to her.</P>
<P>The Prince, during <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI>'s Relation, was &s;eiz'd with an un&s;peakable Affliction, when he heard, that <HI>Felicia</HI> was among the Grand Seig|nior's Women: The Anxiety of &s;uch a cruel Thought over-power'd his Sen&s;es, and his Wound opening, &s;o great a quantity of Blood gu&s;h'd out, that it flung him into a Swoon.</P>
<P><HI>Zulema,</HI> &s;urpriz'd at the Prince's Silence, &s;poke to him, but as he made no Reply, he took his Hand, which was in a cold Sweat; this &s;tartled him, and calling for a Light, he &s;aw the Picture of De&s;pair painted on the Face of this unfortunate Prince, who was without Motion, and his Palene&s;s wou'd have per&s;uad|ed
<PB N="327" REF="331">
one, that his Soul had already left his Body. But how &s;hall I repre&s;ent here the de|plorable Condition of <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion was rais'd to &s;uch a Tran&s;cendency, that hav|ing no Regard to her Honour, &s;he fram'd a fal&s;e Story, to de&s;troy the Prince's Hopes of ever &s;eeing his divine Mi&s;tre&s;s; at another time &s;he wou'd have &s;acrific'd a Thou&s;and Lives to have &s;av'd his, but at this Juncture had he died, one might have accus'd her with being the Cau&s;e of his Death.</P>
<P>Had not <HI>Zulema</HI>'s Concern been &s;o great, he wou'd have ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd that of the Counterfeit Don <HI>Sanche,</HI> who without Re&s;|traint, &s;hed a Deluge of Tears, and expre&s;s'd a more than ordinary Care in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Prince, who at la&s;t receiving a little Strength from the Cordials they gave him, open'd his weak Eyes, which he fix'd langui&s;hingly on his Friend and Don <HI>Sanche,</HI> who&s;e Face he thought he knew, yet did not take much Notice of him; then turning to <HI>Zulema,</HI> Ah, pity me! cry'd he, &s;ince my Misfortunes can never be greater; they are come to their la&s;t period. I had lo&s;t my <HI>Felicia,</HI> and thought her fal&s;e, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;s'd my tormenting Pa&s;&s;ion; but now I am inform|ed, &s;he is Living, and that her Affection for me is &s;till the &s;ame. Had that Tyrant, Death, &s;hatch'd her from me, I &s;hou'd doubtle&s;s have been incon&s;olable for her Lo&s;s, yet methinks I &s;hou'd be free from tho&s;e tumultuous Fears, which now rack my Mind. Oh! What di&s;|mal
<PB N="328" REF="332">
Objects appear to my di&s;tracted Imagina|tion! <HI>Felicia</HI> in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and belov'd by the Grand Seignior! Heavens!

I have lo&s;t her, and &s;hall never &s;ee her more; I am even jealous, and I fear her Heart will at la&s;t yield to the barba|rous Laws, which ill Fortune has impos'd on her. Here his di&s;turb'd Thoughts interrupted his Di&s;cour&s;e, whil&s;t <HI>Zulema</HI> was u&s;ing all his Endeavours to mitigate &s;o violent a Grief. <HI>Felicia</HI> had too &s;incere a Pa&s;&s;ion for you, &s;aid he, ever to change in favour of a Prince, who is no ways agreeable, and is too proud, to give him&s;elf the lea&s;t Trouble towards obtaining the Favours of a Lady; he thinks all mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his Authority, and I am per&s;uaded, that as &s;he will neither reli&s;h his Addre&s;&s;es, nor make any Return, her Re&s;i&s;tance and Coldne&s;s will &s;oon render her indifferent to the Emperour. Sup|po&s;e I were free from the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, in|terrupted the Prince, by what means &s;hall I hear from her? Is &s;he not in the Grand Seigni|or's <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and ab&s;olutely lo&s;t for me? Oh, 'tis too true! I cannot flatter my&s;elf, no, not even wi&s;h to &s;ee her more, which Misfortune compleats my De&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> was in no &s;mall Confu&s;ion, when &s;he heard him &s;peak in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate Terms. She was &s;everal times tempted to make her&s;elf known, that &s;he might addre&s;s her&s;elf to him, in the tendere&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, Love cou'd in&s;pire; but calling to mind what pa&s;s'd between 'em,
<PB N="329" REF="333">
when &s;he acquainted him with <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Flight, it made her apprehend, that if &s;he &s;poke to him at this Juncture, it wou'd be as ill timed, therefore thought proper to wait another Oppor|tunity; in the mean time, &s;he affected an extra|ordinary Concern for the Prince, who remark'd it, and was not &s;low in &s;hewing his Acknow|ledgments; for he told her (thinking he was &s;peaking to a Man) that altho' his pre&s;ent Fortune (being then a Pri&s;oner) did not per|mit him to be&s;tow great Favours on tho&s;e who were in his Service, yet if he was willing to &s;tay with him till he cou'd be better provided for, he wou'd take Care of him. <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> little knew the Effect this Propo&s;al created in our di&s;guis'd Lady, who immediately accepted it, with all imaginable Marks of Joy and Re|&s;pect, a&s;&s;uring him, that no Body wou'd &s;erve him with more Zeal and Fidelity; but before we &s;ee how &s;trict &s;he was to her Promi&s;e, let us be inform'd by what Chance &s;he came to <HI>Granada.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abelhamar</HI> and the Admiral of <HI>Fez</HI> having taken the Ship <HI>Leonida</HI> was in, it was thought <HI>Benavidez</HI> cou'd not recover of the Wounds, he had receiv'd in his vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o was left for Dead; but after <HI>Leonida</HI> had been conducted on Board the Admiral, they found in <HI>Benavidez</HI> &s;ome Symptoms of Life, which made 'em take care of him, till they were landed at <HI>Sallee,</HI> where he continued a long time extremely ill. <HI>Leonida</HI> knew nothing of it, being &s;trictly guarded in the Palace; but as &s;oon as he was recover'd, he re&s;olv'd either
<PB N="330" REF="334">
pay her Ran&s;om, or carry her off by Strata|gem. With this De&s;ign he wrote to <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> who having receiv'd his Letter, lo&s;t no time in preparing for that Voyage; and as her Pa&s;|&s;ion for the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had met with no Return but Di&s;dain, &s;he was meditating on &s;ome de&s;perate Enterprize, in order to act a Vengeance proportionable to the Injury; &s;he thought this might be a favourable Opportu|nity, therefore taking her Jewels, with a con|&s;iderable Sum of Money, &s;he di&s;guis'd her&s;elf in Man's Apparel to prevent her being known, and embark'd for <HI>Sallee,</HI> where &s;he arriv'd &s;oon after, with the Re&s;olution of taking away <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Life; and to &s;ucceed in her wicked De&s;ign, &s;he had brought with her a Box of the &s;ubtile&s;t Poi&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Benavidez</HI> was not a little overjoy'd at <HI>Ca&s;il|da</HI>'s Arrival, and after he had paid his Ran|&s;om to the Admiral, he only thought of re|covering <HI>Leonida:</HI> But the Queen, having an extraordinary Friend&s;hip for her, hardly &s;uffer'd her to be out of her Sight, which made him fear his attempt wou'd be in vain. This was the State of his Affairs, when the King of <HI>Tunis</HI> invaded the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> which oblig'd <HI>Celima</HI> to abandon <HI>Sallee;</HI> and at the &s;ame time that &s;he embark'd, <HI>Benavidez</HI> and his Si&s;ter in di&s;gui&s;e took their pa&s;&s;age in one of the Ships, which were bound for <HI>Granada:</HI> During their Voyage, they often &s;aw <HI>Leonida</HI> aboard the Queen's Ship, who&s;e Sight only inflam'd <HI>Benavidez</HI>'s Heart with Love, and <HI>Ca|&s;ilda</HI>'s
<PB N="331" REF="335">
with Rage; but the dreadful Storm which aro&s;e, di&s;per&s;ing the Fleet, their Ship was driven &s;ome Leagues beyond <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where they landed, and &s;et out immediately on Hor&s;eback for <HI>Granada. Ca&s;ilda,</HI> who was of a weak Con&s;titution, and already very much fatigu'd with her Voyage, was left a great way behind, which was the Occa&s;ion of her not arriving, till after her Brother's Rencounter with the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> which was then too late.</P>
<P>I have already told you with what Marks of Honour and Di&s;tinction the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> was receiv'd at her Arrival at the Court of <HI>Granada;</HI> but I did not mention the magnifi|cent Entertainment the King gave her at the Palace of <HI>Alhambro;</HI> after which, the Princes and mo&s;t part of the Noblemen conducted her to the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Abbaicyn,</HI> which was pre|par'd for her, and there took leave of her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was at Liberty to give &s;ome time to Reflection, &s;he went to take the Air on a Terrace Walk, adjoyning her Apartment, which had a Pro&s;pect over the River <HI>Daro;</HI> there a thou&s;and hurrying Thoughts &s;tarted from her Mind: What Cour&s;e &s;hall I take, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, and whom &s;hall I tru&s;t with my Secret? Mu&s;t I once more (to the Shame of my Sex and Glory) make my Weakne&s;s known to this lovely Stranger? Heaven has &s;ent him to me again, and I am inclin'd to believe he is thinking on me. Yes
<PB N="332" REF="336">
certainly! The <HI>Apollo</HI> pur&s;uing <HI>Daphne,</HI> which was painted on his Shield, with his Motto; nay more than that, his langui&s;hing Looks and Di&s;tractions; in &s;hort, every thing per|&s;uades me, he is in Love; yet if it were with me, ought not he to be in&s;pir'd with &s;ome Motions of Sympathy, which wou'd have told him that his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> were the &s;ame? Why does he not di&s;cover as many Charms in my Per|&s;on, as he did in my Wit and Genero&s;ity? Alas, he was then too young to feel the Effects of Love; Gratitude was the only thing that mov'd him to make a Return, and I now fear, &s;ome &s;ofter Care imploys his Thoughts: But, continu'd &s;he, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that Fortune has brought him once more in my way, only to add fre&s;h Afflictions to tho&s;e I have already undergone: I am rather di&s;pos'd to look on this, as the beginning of a Hap|pine&s;s, which will end by the De&s;truction of my Enemies. This Prince is nearly related to the King of <HI>France;</HI> I will make my&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and in giving him my Hand, pre&s;ent him with my Crown: He may head an Army and invade the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> which he &s;oon will be Ma&s;ter of. The People, by my Example, will &s;ubmit to his Laws; and after being an unhappy Fugitive, de&s;titute of all Hopes, I &s;hall &s;ee my&s;elf Crown'd with un|&s;peakable Felicity. <HI>Celima</HI> thus indulg'd her Imagination, till it grew &s;o late, that &s;he thought fit to retire to her Apartment, where
<PB N="333" REF="337">
&s;he pa&s;s'd the Night betwixt &s;oft Repo&s;e, and a Thou&s;and agreeable Ideas, which made her appear the next Day in all her Charms.</P>
<P>But before the Queen wou'd admit of any Vi&s;it, &s;he &s;ent for <HI>Felicia,</HI> to whom &s;he &s;poke in the&s;e Terms; I am de&s;irous to know, whe|ther your Sentiments for the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> are &s;till the &s;ame; therefore, <HI>Felicia,</HI> confe&s;s ingenuou&s;ly the Truth. Has not his Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s been capable to extingui&s;h the Affection you had for him, when you were per&s;uaded of his Con&s;tancy? Search well in|to your Heart, for I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to en|quire about it; and whatever An&s;wer you make me, I &s;hall not love you the le&s;s. The&s;e Que&s;ti|ons caus'd &s;ome Surprize in <HI>Felicia,</HI> who at fir&s;t, had a mind to di&s;gui&s;e her Sentiments; but having con&s;ider'd, that &s;he had not long before confe&s;s'd her Weakne&s;s to the Queen, &s;he was of Opinion, it was better to &s;peak her Thoughts without any Di&s;&s;imulation. Ma|dam, reply'd &s;he, &s;ince they are your Maje&s;ty's Commands, I cannot refu&s;e obeying; I own with the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, that till now, it has not been in my Power to bani&s;h from my Heart the fatal Idea of the Count of <HI>La Vagne.</HI> I daily entertain my&s;elf with the Cau&s;e I have to hate him as the cruelle&s;t of my Enemies: Yet alas! it is pa&s;t my Skill, and I dare not even hope, that time it &s;elf will ever be a|ble to effect my Cure. You do love him then, interrupted the Queen? If Love con&s;i&s;ts in of|ten thinking of a Per&s;on, reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> I
<PB N="334" REF="338">
am convinc'd I &s;till have an Affection for him. I may now confide in you, reply'd the Queen, therefore hear me, and be &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I was hardly out of my Infancy, when my unlucky Stars decreed I &s;hou'd fall into the Hands <HI>Bajazet,</HI> who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion for me only increas'd my Aver&s;ion to him, and I thought nothing cou'd be more deplorable than my De&s;tiny.</P>
<P>The&s;e were my Sentiments when he went into <HI>Mi&s;&s;ia,</HI> and compell'd me to go along with him, where after a Victory over the Chri&s;ti|ans, he was de&s;irous to &s;ee the Pri&s;oners of Di&s;tinction, who had been taken; and as out of a politick Motive he endeavour'd to in|&s;pire me with Cruelty, and inure me to Tra|gick Scenes, he order'd, I &s;hou'd be placed at a Window which was grated, and look'd over the Court, where the Chri&s;tians were to &s;uffer Death, and &s;everal Noblemen of <HI>France</HI> had already been executed, when I &s;aw a young Prince appear, who&s;e Beauty &s;urpa&s;s'd that which we attribute to the God of Love: He &s;eem'd to be about Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age; he was tall, well-&s;hap'd, and had fair Hair, which hung in fine Curls on his Shoul|ders, and in &s;pite of his carele&s;s Air, he had &s;omething &s;o great and noble in his Mien, that the other Princes were not to be compar'd to him. Oh, <HI>Felicia!</HI> cou'd you but imagine what I felt in that Moment; a quick Emoti|on &s;eiz'd all my Soul, I was troubled with|out knowing the Cau&s;e, and in a Word, had

like to have died, for fear <HI>Bajazet</HI> &s;hou'd have taken away a Life, which was already dearer to me than my own. I began to think what I cou'd do, to deliver this lovely Prince from the immediate Danger which threaten'd him; whether to fling my&s;elf at <HI>Bajazet</HI>'s Feet, and beg his Life, or to offer my&s;elf a Victim in his Room, for I cou'd have done any thing to &s;ave him; but whil&s;t a Thou&s;and &s;uch Thoughts were torturing my Mind, the Emperor re&s;olv'd on accepting his Ran&s;om, which News &s;o tran&s;ported me, that my Joy was inexpre&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>This young Prince was Pri&s;oner in the Tower of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and as my Apartment had a Pro&s;pect of it, I us'd to pa&s;s whole Days at my Clo&s;et Window in fruitle&s;s Sighs and Wi&s;hes; but one Evening, as I was endeavour|ing, with the help of a Tele&s;cope, to di&s;cover the Object I &s;o dearly lov'd, I perceiv'd him walking on the Leads of the Tower, and he appear'd to me &s;o melancholy, that it threw me into the deepe&s;t Concern. I immediately re&s;olv'd on writing to him, notwith&s;tanding the Danger to which I expos'd my&s;elf, if <HI>Bajazet</HI> had known it: But Love is often more lucky than wi&s;e, and Chance on that Occa&s;ion is a much better Servant than Rea|&s;on. When I had ended my Letter, I confided it to an Eunuch, who had attended me a long time, and &s;hew'd a particular Affection for my Service. What did I not &s;ay to per&s;uade him to be faithful? which having promis'd me,
<PB N="336" REF="340">
even at the hazard of his Life, he convey'd my Letter to the Top of the Tower by means of an Arrow; and the Prince having receiv'd it, &s;ent me an An&s;wer, which entirely van|qui&s;h'd me. I was inform'd that his Ran&s;om was not come, and the more I con&s;ider'd how dear he daily grew to me, the greater Cau&s;e I had to fear equally for him and my&s;elf. I was perfectly acquainted with <HI>Bajazet</HI>'s inhu|man Temper, and too &s;en&s;ible of my own Weakne&s;s, to believe that it wou'd be in my Power to fly a Prince, who &s;o entirely po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd my Thoughts. The&s;e Con&s;iderations oblig'd me to take Mea&s;ures for his immediate Departure; but alas! What Torments did not I endure, thro' the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o cruel a Re|&s;olution?</P>
<P>To this Effect, I was forc'd once more to confide in my Eunuch, who brib'd one of the Prince's Guards, by who&s;e means a &s;trong Box was convey'd into his Chamber, wherein I &s;ent him a con&s;iderable Sum to pay his Ran&s;om, and a Letter, which was the la&s;t I wrote to him, being bereft of the hopes of ever &s;eeing him more. Imagine, <HI>Felicia,</HI> how many anxious Hours I have pa&s;s'd, &s;ince that unlucky Day!</P>
<P>Soon after, <HI>Bajazet</HI>'s Fortune met with an unhappy Change; for <HI>Tamerlane</HI> having en|gag'd him, gain'd a compleat Victory, and took him Pri&s;oner. It was with no &s;mall difficulty I made my E&s;cape, and return'd to my Father's Dominions; where I was no &s;ooner arriv'd, but &s;everal Kings and Princes made their Ad|dre&s;&s;es
<PB N="337" REF="341">
to me, &s;ome out of Ambition, and others out of a &s;incere Love for my Per&s;on; but I was &s;o entirely prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Idea of him, who had charm'd me at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> that nothing at <HI>Sallee</HI> was capable of making an Impre&s;&s;ion on me; &s;o in &s;pight of my&s;elf I was in Love, without Hopes of a return. This was the State of my Mind at my Ar|rival here; but how can I expre&s;s the Surprize and Agitation I was in, when among&s;t the Noblemen, who came to receive me out of the Gates of the Town, I perceiv'd the Man I love. This Chri&s;tian Prince (under the Name, and Dre&s;s of a <HI>Moor)</HI> appear'd to me as charming as ever; no, it's impo&s;&s;ible for you to comprehend what I felt at &s;o unexpected a Rencounter. My Heart was &s;eiz'd with &s;o many different Motions, that I was not able to &s;peak; and whil&s;t I was endeavouring to recover my&s;elf, <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> (for that is the Name he goes by at this Court) approach'd, and gave me an Occa&s;ion to &s;ee the Motto that was painted on his Shield, which per&s;uaded me, the Memory of his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis</HI> was dear to him. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was equal|ly &s;urpriz'd and overjoy'd, for I cou'd not flatter my&s;elf, with being &s;till in the Thoughts of that young Prince, who had not the &s;ame Motives to in&s;pire him. I had &s;een him, and was inform'd of his Name and Birth, but he had neither &s;een me, nor knew who I was; there|fore what had touch'd him, was either Gra|titude, or the obliging Expre&s;&s;ions of my

Letters, which I mu&s;t &s;ay are no &s;mall Attrac|tives to a generous Soul.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Felicia,</HI> I have a mind that you &s;hou'd talk with him, and endeavour to di&s;|cover his Sentiments. The Management of this Affair, which I intru&s;t you with, is of a nice quality; but as you are very di&s;creet, I cannot imploy any one, who will give me le&s;s Su&s;picion; tho' I mu&s;t own my Weakne&s;s to you, I am naturally of a jealous Temper, and a Confidant &s;o beautiful as you, with <HI>A&s;|&s;imir</HI>'s Merit, might give me &s;ome Apprehen|&s;ion, were it not that you are entirely pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in favour of the Count of <HI>La Vagne.

What, re|ply'd the Queen, wou'd you yield to another, the advantage of doing me a piece of Service? Is not your Affection for me great enough to prevent you from acting tho&s;e Faults, you fore&s;ee? <HI>Felicia</HI> under&s;tood by what the Queen &s;aid to her, that her Maje&s;ty wou'd be highly di&s;oblig'd, &s;hou'd &s;he neglect &s;o fair an Op|portunity

<P><HI>Felicia</HI> immediately retir'd, in order to write to <HI>A&s;&s;imir,</HI> and finding <HI>Inea</HI> in her Chamber, &s;he gave her an Account what had pa&s;s'd be|tween the Queen and her; then wrote her Letter in the&s;e Terms.</P>

<P>This Letter <HI>Felicia</HI> &s;hew'd to the Queen, who call'd for one of her Pages, and charg'd him to go and deliver it to <HI>A&s;&s;imir,</HI> who (as I told you before) was extremely afflicted at what <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (under the Di&s;gui&s;e of Don <HI>San|che)</HI> had &s;pitefully intimated concerning <HI>Felicia.</HI> The mean while <HI>Zulema</HI> (who had &s;tay'd by the Prince) was &s;aying all he cou'd to &s;often his Di&s;tre&s;s; and as he was talking to him, they came to tell <HI>A&s;&s;imir,</HI> that one of the
<PB N="340" REF="344">
Queen of <HI>Fez</HI>'s Pages had a Letter to deliver to him. This caus'd &s;ome Emotion in the Prince, who looking at his Friend; Can you conceive, &s;aid he, what may be the meaning of this Letter? If I may believe my Thoughts, reply'd <HI>Zulema,</HI> they per&s;uade me, &s;ome agree|able News is coming to you, my Lord. What|ever it be, &s;aid the Prince, I de&s;ire you will &s;peak to the Page; I am unwilling to &s;ee him for fear he &s;hou'd di&s;cover the Di&s;order I am in.</P>
<P><HI>Zulema</HI> readily &s;atisfy'd the Prince's Impa|tience; he took the Letter, and brought it to him, which he no &s;ooner open'd, but knew the Name and Writing. Heavens! How great was his Surprize! He cou'd not conceal his Tran|&s;ports, but giving the Letter back to <HI>Zulema,</HI> &s;aid, am I in a Dream, or mu&s;t I believe what I &s;ee? Is my <HI>Felicia</HI> in <HI>Granada,</HI> whil&s;t I am bemoaning her Ab&s;ence, and bereft of all Hopes of ever &s;eeing her more? <HI>Zulema,</HI> my dear <HI>Zulema!</HI> how can I outlive &s;o unexpect|ed a Felicity? Indeed, my Lord, reply'd his Friend, I am &s;en&s;ibly touch'd at your good Fortune, and heartily congratulate you; but am afraid, you will go to the Palace of <HI>Ab|baicyn,</HI> before your Wound is heal'd, which may prove very dangerous to you. Were I to hazard my Life, an&s;wer'd the Prince, I wou'd not defer the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, and as I am not able to write, I de&s;ire you wou'd do it for me. I am a&s;&s;ur'd, &s;aid <HI>Zulema,</HI> that &s;he does not know the Condition you are in,

otherwi&s;e &s;he wou'd be very much concern'd at the little Care you take of a Life, which ought to be dear to her; but I am ready to do any thing, my Lord, to oblige you; &s;o the Prince dictated the&s;e Lines.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>YOU are not &s;o great a Stranger to me, as you imagine, adorable</HI> Felicia. <HI>I do not doubt, but you will be convinc'd of it, a&s;&s;oon as I have the Plea&s;ure of Saluting you.

</LETTER>
<P>Whil&s;t the pa&s;&s;ionate Prince was abandon|ing him&s;elf to a Thou&s;and Tran&s;ports of Joy and Impatience, the Page deliver'd his Letter to the Queen, who having read it, was &s;eiz'd with the deepe&s;t Chagrin. Was any Fatality like this, cry'd &s;he? <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> is acquainted with <HI>Felicia,</HI> and &s;ays, he will attend her, tho' he is wounded. What Accident cou'd have hap|pen'd to him, &s;ince Ye&s;terday? Sure there mu&s;t needs be an intimate Under&s;tanding be|tween <HI>Felicia,</HI> and him, tho' &s;he has conceal'd it from me. I thought her Sentiments for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> wou'd have left me no room to apprehend any thing from her: But alas! How deceiv'd have I been? Well, I am re&s;olv'd, &s;he &s;hall neither &s;ee him, nor &s;peak to him. As <HI>Celima</HI> was thus rea&s;oning with her&s;elf, <HI>Felicia</HI> enter'd her Chamber. <HI>A&s;|&s;imir,</HI> &s;aid the Queen to her, has receiv'd
<PB N="342" REF="346">
your Letter, and is very much indi&s;pos'd, therefore cou'd not write to you. <HI>Felicia</HI> &s;eem'd concern'd at his Illne&s;s, thinking by that means to pay her Court to the Queen; but &s;he cou'd not have taken a more indirect Step towards it, for <HI>Celima</HI> was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Opinion of <HI>Felicia</HI>'s having a Corre&s;pon|dence with the Prince, that the mo&s;t innocent Actions of this young Slave, in her Eyes ap|pear'd Criminal.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Granada</HI> (being now indi&s;pos'd,) &s;ent his two Sons to vi&s;it <HI>Celima,</HI> whom they invited to take the Air in the Fore&s;t; this Queen accepted the Invitation, and as <HI>A&s;&s;imir</HI> Illne&s;s had been confirm'd to her by the Princes, <HI>Ma|homet</HI> and <HI>O&s;min,</HI> &s;he did not in the lea&s;t ima|gine, that he wou'd venture to go abroad; be&s;ides, <HI>Celima</HI> had ob&s;erv'd, that <HI>O&s;min</HI> was mightily taken with <HI>Felicia,</HI> which extremely pleas'd her; for &s;he wou'd not have cared, had all the Monarchs of the Univer&s;e ador'd that lovely Captive, &s;o the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had but look'd on her Indifference.</P>
<P>Thus the Court &s;et out from the Palace of <HI>Abbaicyn,</HI> follow'd by a great Number of mu|&s;ical In&s;truments. All the Ladies were &s;eated in little open Chariots, each of them having a Cavalier to drive them: <HI>Mahomet</HI> drove the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI>'s Chariot, and <HI>O&s;min Felicia</HI>'s. As they were going by the Palace of <HI>Alham|bro,</HI> the Queen de&s;ired &s;he might &s;top a little to enquire after the King's Health.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="347">
<HI>Zulema</HI> hearing that <HI>Celima</HI> was coming to the Palace, told the Prince &s;he &s;hou'd pa&s;s under his Windows, and that if he was able to ri&s;e, perhaps he might &s;ee <HI>Felicia.</HI> Heavens! cry'd the Prince, what wou'd not I do for &s;o dear a Satisfaction? With that, he leap'd out of Bed, and having put on &s;ome Clothes, went and &s;at in one of the Balconies of his Apartment, where &s;oon after he &s;aw <HI>Celima,</HI> and <HI>Felicia</HI> attending her. <HI>O&s;min</HI> perceiving the Prince, de&s;ired this beauteous Lady to take Notice of him; but how &s;hall I expre&s;s the Motions which &s;eiz'd her Soul, when &s;he knew him to be her Lover? The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> on the other &s;ide, was &s;o tran&s;ported, that he was ju&s;t going to &s;peak to her, had not <HI>Zulema</HI> per&s;uaded him to the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Felicia</HI> was in &s;uch a di&s;order, that at fir&s;t &s;he knew not what to &s;ay; but being extreme|ly de&s;irous to be inform'd by what Chance her fal&s;e Lover happen'd to be in <HI>Granada,</HI> for &s;he took him for the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> &s;he recover'd her&s;elf a little, and told <HI>O&s;min,</HI> that the Per&s;on he had &s;hewn her appear'd to be a Stranger. You judge right, Madam, reply'd he, for he is a <HI>Genoue&s;e,</HI> of the noble Hou&s;e of <HI>Fie&s;ques:</HI> The late King having be|&s;ieg'd <HI>Jean,</HI> took him Pri&s;oner, and &s;ent him to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salobrena,</HI> where my Father, my Bother, and I were confin'd. There I con|tracted an intimate Friend&s;hip with the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> (that's his Title) and after <HI>Maho|met</HI>'s Death, my Father coming to the Throne,
<PB N="344" REF="348">
conceiv'd &s;o particular an E&s;teem for this illu|&s;trious Count, that he gave him his Liberty, upon Condition, that he wou'd not part from <HI>Granada</HI> without his Con&s;ent; therefore he &s;till remains with us, and we are daily charm'd with his noble and polite Behaviour.</P>
<P>The&s;e Encomiums, which <HI>O&s;min</HI> gave to the Count, were very acceptable to <HI>Felicia,</HI> not|with&s;tanding the Rea&s;ons &s;he had to be di&s;|&s;atisfy'd with his Conduct. She then ask'd him, when the Count had been taken Pri&s;oner; but nothing cou'd a&s;toni&s;h her more, than what <HI>O&s;min</HI> told her on that Subject; for either the Scene, which pa&s;s'd at <HI>Sallee</HI> between <HI>Olympia,</HI> the Count, and her, was a Vi&s;ion, (which &s;he had no room to believe) or what <HI>O&s;min</HI> was &s;aying to her, cou'd not be &s;incere. This made her impatient to be with <HI>Inea,</HI> to en|tertain her with this &s;urprizing Adventure; and &s;he grew of a &s;udden &s;o pen&s;ive, that &s;he cou'd not make any Reply to the obliging Terms, in which <HI>O&s;min</HI> addre&s;s'd her. What is it that troubles you, divine <HI>Felicia,</HI> &s;aid he to her? You &s;eem very melancholy; do but confide in me, and I will u&s;e my be&s;t Endea|vours to de&s;erve &s;o great a Favour. Alas, my Lord! (reply'd <HI>Felicia,</HI> with a dejected Air) what Secret cou'd I impart to you? I am an unfortunate Captive, and perhaps I repine at the Cruelty of that De&s;tiny, from whence flows the Sorrow, which you perceive. Vouch|&s;afe, Madam, &s;aid <HI>O&s;min,</HI> to accept of my Ser|vice; I may procure you your Liberty, and &s;oon

remove the Cau&s;e of your Unea&s;ine&s;s; but you mu&s;t at lea&s;t give me leave to pay Homage to your tran&s;cendent Charms, &s;ince they have in|&s;pir'd me with &s;uch Sentiments, as do not merit a di&s;obliging Return. I conjure you, a|miable <HI>Felicia,</HI> to be favourable to me, and let me feed my Pa&s;&s;ion with the Hopes of your Affection. I cannot an&s;wer your Re|que&s;t, my Lord, interrupted <HI>Felicia;</HI> I have too great a Regard for you, and as an Evince|ment of it, I declare, that I am neither de|&s;irous to be belov'd, nor di&s;pos'd to receive an Impre&s;&s;ion: It is a Re&s;olution I have made, which nothing &s;hall induce me to change, therefore I intreat you, my Lord, never to think on me more.

<P>The Court being return'd from the Fore&s;t, <HI>Celima,</HI> (who&s;e Thoughts were entirely im|ploy'd on her Rendezvous with the Prince of <HI>Carency)</HI> retir'd to her Palace, and <HI>Felicia</HI> went to her Chamber, where &s;he found <HI>Inea,</HI> whom &s;he embrac'd tenderly, and &s;aid, How &s;hall I expre&s;s to you, my Dear, the Agitation of my Mind? The Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> is here; I have ju&s;t &s;een him in the Palace of <HI>Alhambro;</HI> it is no Imagination; for he &s;aluted me &s;o re&s;pect|fully, that I cou'd not help returning the Civi|lity, and I am even a&s;ham'd of having di&s;|cover'd

It is very probable, interrupted <HI>Inea;</HI> for what pa&s;s'd at <HI>Sallee,</HI> is not to be contradicted, and per|haps he is now &s;orry for having di&s;obliged you; therefore you mu&s;t re&s;olve to pardon him.

<P>His A&s;toni&s;hment was &s;o great, that he cou'd not help crying out aloud, and any one might have perceiv'd, by his Emotion, the &s;trange Di&s;order he was in. The Queen being in a Clo&s;et, that look'd on the Terrace Walk, ea&s;ily &s;aw the Prince's Action, and knew
<PB N="348" REF="352">
his Voice, which made her gue&s;s what had pa&s;s'd; therefore approaching him with a Ma|je&s;tick Air; I am come to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Prince, &s;aid &s;he, (taking his Hand and &s;mi|ling,) follow me, I have &s;omething to tell you, which is of too great a Con&s;equence to be conceal'd from you any longer.</P>
<P>The Queen went in fir&s;t, but <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> being oblig'd to wait without, was mighty unea&s;y concerning what might pa&s;s between <HI>Celima</HI> and the Prince.

<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was amaz'd to hear the Queen expre&s;s her&s;elf in the&s;e Terms, and before he cou'd make her any An&s;wer: Nay, continu'd &s;he, you will own my Knowledge is no Fiction, when I tell you, that you was in <HI>Mi&s;ia,</HI> and taken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Bajazet;</HI> be&s;ides, whil&s;t you were in the Tower of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> did not you receive very pa&s;&s;ionate Letters, and a con&s;iderable Supply from a Lady, who, to this Hour, is unknown to you? The Prince &s;igh'd, and &s;eeing <HI>Celima</HI> waited an An&s;wer; It is, as your Maje&s;ty &s;ays, reply'd he, and &s;ince you are &s;o well inform'd of what has hap|pen'd to me, I beg, Madam, you will tell me who was that charming Unknown. This Re|que&s;t extremely pleas'd the Queen, who con|cealing her Satisfaction, &s;aid to him, Out of what Motive, do you de&s;ire to know this Lady, perhaps you may never &s;ee her? That is a Misfortune, I fear, Madam, interrupted the Prince; yet I often flatter my&s;elf, that &s;ome lucky Chance will convey me were &s;he is. But (added the Queen, in an Accent which di&s;cover'd part of her Sentiments) is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Memory of a Per&s;on can be &s;till dear to you, who had no other Attractive to engage you, but her writing a few obliging Letters, and &s;ending you a Sum of Money to pay your Ran&s;om? Ah, Madam! reply'd he, there are Impre&s;&s;ions, which never can be effac'd, and cou'd you conceive the Torments I have
<PB N="350" REF="354">
endured for that Unknown, you wou'd &s;oon be convinc'd, that one may feel the &s;harpe&s;t Darts of Love, without &s;eeing the influencing Object. Is it then really true, &s;aid the Queen, that you are impatient to &s;ee her, and that &s;he often imploys your Thoughts? I declare it is &s;incerely &s;o, Madam, an&s;wer'd the Prince, and there is nothing I wi&s;h more ardently, than an Opportunity of making my Retributions to a Lady, who has conferr'd &s;o high an Ob|ligation on me. Well, Prince, &s;aid <HI>Celima</HI> &s;miling, I will con&s;ult with &s;ome favourable Genius in order to compleat your De&s;ire. Come to me to Morrow at the &s;ame Hour, and you &s;hall be farther inform'd of this Sub|ject. The Prince return'd his Acknowledgments to her in a mo&s;t grateful Manner, and retir'd to the Palace of <HI>Alhambro</HI> with the di&s;guis'd <HI>Ca|&s;ilda,</HI> who was waiting on the Terrace.</P>
<P><HI>Zulema</HI> (impatient to know what had pa&s;s'd at the <HI>Abbaicyn)</HI> repair'd &s;oon after to the Prince's Apartment, and <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (who perceiv'd, they had &s;ome matter of Importance to communi|cate to one another, feigning to withdraw) went and hid her&s;elf in a Place, where &s;he cou'd hear their Conver&s;ation. You think, perhaps, &s;aid the Prince to <HI>Zulema,</HI> that I have &s;een <HI>Felicia,</HI> and am going to inform you of the Particulars of an agreeable Rendezvous; but in&s;tead of that, my dear Friend, I mu&s;t tell you, &s;ome <HI>Daemon</HI> appear'd to me in the Shape of an ugly old Creature, and that I was in the greate&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment, when the
<PB N="351" REF="355">
Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> came upon the Terrace, and de|&s;ired me to follow her into her Clo&s;et; where I no &s;ooner enter'd, but &s;he endeavour'd to per&s;uade me, that &s;he had acquired an extra|ordinary Knowledge, by corre&s;ponding with good and evil Genius's, and in reality &s;he told me every thing relating to my Adventure at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> which very much &s;urpriz'd me; for &s;he certainly mu&s;t have been inform'd of it, by the Unknown her&s;elf, whom, I believe, is now among&s;t her Slaves; and I cannot put it out of my Head, but <HI>Felicia</HI> wrote to me by the Queen's Orders.</P>
<P>Here the Prince was &s;ome time &s;ilent, and <HI>Zulema</HI> &s;poke to him in the&s;e Terms: I begin to have a Thought, which appears to me very probable, and you may judge of it your &s;elf, my Lord, when I have inform'd you, that <HI>Celima</HI> her&s;elf was at <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> at the time that the Chri&s;tians were defeated by <HI>Bajazet:</HI> As you were of the number of the Pri&s;oners, it is likely &s;he &s;aw you, and receiv'd an Impre&s;|&s;ion; be&s;ides, if you con&s;ider the Pre&s;ent, which was &s;ent you in the Tower, it cou'd not come from a Per&s;on of an inferiour Rank, and&mdash;You give me &s;uch a Light into the matter, interrupted the Prince, as opens my Eyes at once. I cannot call to mind what the Queen &s;aid to me the Day of her Arri|val, and the Conver&s;ation we have ju&s;t had together, without being convinc'd, that &s;he is my Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> Alas! into what a Labyrinth am I fallen? <HI>Felicia</HI> is with her,
<PB N="352" REF="356">
and if &s;he di&s;covers my Pa&s;&s;ion for that love|ly Creature, I fear &s;he will make her feel the Effects of her Revenge. Ah, cruel De&s;tiny! cry'd he; am I born only to pa&s;s my Days in a continual Series of Woes, and have you decreed, that I &s;hall never be happy? Here, the tormenting Thoughts of his pa&s;t Di&s;ap|pointment, came fre&s;h to his Mind, and inter|rupting his Di&s;cour&s;e, threw him into &s;o deep a Melancholy, that even his Friend <HI>Zulema</HI> endeavour'd un&s;ucce&s;sfully to divert it; there|fore as it was late, he took his leave of the Prince, tho' extremely concern'd at not hav|ing it in his Power to give him &s;ome Relief.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Prince and <HI>Zulema</HI> were enter|taining each other, <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> heard their whole Conver&s;ation; and finding &s;he had no hopes left of ever touching the Heart of a Prince, for whom &s;he had already acted many Extra|vagances, &s;he re&s;olv'd on &s;ome de&s;perate Un|dertaking. Her Revenge again&s;t her Rival was more predominant, than either the Pa&s;|&s;ion &s;he had for the Prince, or her own Honour; &s;o that nothing le&s;s than the Death of the un|happy <HI>Leonida</HI> cou'd &s;atisfy her raging Spirit.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> (extremely overjoy'd at what the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had &s;aid to her) was forming a thou&s;and agreeable Projects, not doubting but his Pa&s;&s;ion for his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis</HI> was very &s;incere, and that he wou'd be equally tran&s;ported to find &s;he was the Per&s;on; yet as her Jealou&s;y of <HI>Felicia</HI> gave her much Unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he thought it pru|dent,
<PB N="353" REF="357">
fir&s;t to clear her Su&s;picions on that Sub|ject; for, &s;aid &s;he, if the Prince has &s;een that beautiful Captive, he mu&s;t needs love her; therefore I will contrive, they &s;hall meet in a place where I may hear their Di&s;cour&s;e, which will give me &s;ome In&s;ight into the matter.</P>
<P><HI>Celima</HI> immediately &s;ent for <HI>Felicia,</HI> and be|ing alone with her: I command you, &s;aid &s;he, to be &s;incere with me. Con&s;ider, you are my Slave, and that your De&s;tiny is in my Power; I can make you happy, if you will confe&s;s the Truth. Read this! (continu'd &s;he, &s;hewing her the Letter, which the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had de&s;ired <HI>Zulema</HI> to write) do you know the Writing? <HI>Felicia</HI> read it, and having examin'd it &s;ome time, told the Queen &s;he &s;incerely cou'd not tell who&s;e Hand it was, which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;atisfy'd <HI>Celima;</HI> yet to be thoroughly convinc'd in an Affair, that &s;o nearly concern'd her; Tell me, &s;aid &s;he, have you ever heard of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> related to the Kings of <HI>France? Felicia,</HI> at this Que|&s;tion, did not doubt but the Queen knew her, and without being any ways out of Counte|nance, reply'd, that the Name of &s;o illu&s;tri|ous a Family was not unknown to her. And are you acquainted with any one of that Name, &s;aid <HI>Celima?</HI> Did not you &s;ee the Count of <HI>La March,</HI> or the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> when you were in <HI>Spain?</HI> No, Madam, an&s;wer'd &s;he, I never &s;aw tho&s;e Princes; they are intire Strangers to me.

I &s;poke of, and who appear'd &s;o charm|ing to me, is of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and is call'd the Prince of <HI>Carency:</HI> I have a mind you &s;hou'd talk with him, and endeavour to penetrate into his Sentiments; he came here la&s;t Night, when I order'd the Governe&s;s of the Slaves to entertain him; but &s;he mana|ged the matter &s;o very ill, that I mu&s;t wholly depend upon you. Had the Queen's Thoughts been le&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with her Project, &s;he might have di&s;cover'd <HI>Felicia</HI>'s Surprize, when &s;he heard, the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was the Per&s;on whom the Queen lov'd, and that he was actu|ally in <HI>Granada:</HI> But her mind being other|ways employ'd, this young Slave had time to recover from her Di&s;order, and &s;aid to <HI>Celima;</HI> Your Plea&s;ure, Madam, is &s;o dear to me, that I fear I &s;hall not be able to effect your Maje|&s;ty's Commands with Succe&s;s; for I have but very little Experience, and &s;hou'd I mi&s;carry in an Affair, which requires &s;o much Prudence, I cou'd never forgive my&s;elf. No, reply'd the Queen, do not let that give you the lea&s;t Un|ea&s;ine&s;s; I know you better than you know your&s;elf, and am per&s;uaded, you cannot do any thing ami&s;s: But as the Moon &s;hines very bright, I do not think it proper you &s;hou'd meet the Prince on the Terrace, becau&s;e I &s;aw many People walking there la&s;t Night, and it wou'd not be convenient I &s;hou'd be &s;een with him; therefore I will give Orders, that he may be convey'd to the Grotto in the Wood, where you may entertain him till I come to you.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="359">

the Prince &s;hall not know who I am: As he has &s;een my Picture, he may call to mind its Re&s;emblance, therefore I will hid my Face &s;o well, that he &s;hall not &s;ee it. <HI>Inea</HI> finding <HI>Felicia</HI> was fix'd on that Re&s;olution, wou'd not any ways oppo&s;e it, tho' &s;he was of a con|trary Opinion.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was now thinking on means to convey a Letter to <HI>Felicia,</HI> in or|der to know, how he might have an Oppor|tunity of entertaining her. He told his De&s;ign to <HI>Zulema,</HI> who advis'd him not to write, for fear his Letter &s;hou'd fall into the Hands of the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> but promis'd him, he wou'd contrive &s;ome way to &s;peak to her. By this time, the Hour of the Prince's Appoint|ment was near, yet he made no great ha&s;te to go to the Palace, for he began to reflect, that a Second Interview with <HI>Celima</HI> wou'd only puzzle him, becau&s;e he believ'd, &s;he was his Unknown of <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and that, were &s;he in|form'd of his Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Felicia,</HI> it might prove of a fatal Con&s;equence.</P>

The Prince did not doubt in &s;ee|ing her, but it was the &s;ame old Woman he

had met the Night before; which made him re&s;olve not to have any di&s;cour&s;e with her. <HI>Fe|licia</HI> on the other &s;ide (who felt &s;trange Emo|tions, finding her &s;elf, at that In&s;tant, with the Prince of <HI>Carency)</HI> was &s;ome time without &s;peaking; but &s;he had &s;carcely broke Silence, when the Prince, knowing the Voice of his lovely Mi&s;tre&s;s, went and flung him&s;elf at her Feet. <HI>Leonida,</HI> Charming <HI>Leonida!</HI> &s;aid he, what a Ble&s;&s;ing is this?

The Prince thinking &s;he was angry, that he had conceal'd his Name from her; I am guilty, Madam, I confe&s;s, reply'd he, for not hav|ing confided in you; I ought to have told you, that I was the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> and not have appear'd under an other Title; but the cruel De&s;igns of <HI>Leonora</HI> (by who&s;e Or|ders I was pur&s;ued, when I parted from <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> and wounded in the Fore&s;t, where you found me) was the Occa&s;ion I chang'd my Name, and took that of the Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> whom I very much re&s;embled.

<PB N="358" REF="362">

Do you think, my Sen&s;es cou'd deceive me, or that I am not capable of re&s;enting the Perfidy? I cannot tell to this Hour, whether you are the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> or the Count of <HI>La Vagne;</HI> but what I am certain of, is, that you are the Per&s;on, who has highly injured me, and it wou'd be a &s;hameful Weakne&s;s in me to pardon you.

<PB N="359" REF="363">
who believ'd his dear <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Mind was di&s;|compos'd; and what confirm'd this Opinion, was his being per&s;uaded, that the Count of <HI>La Vagne</HI> peri&s;hed at Sea, in his Return from <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and that <HI>Olympia Doria</HI> died in her Father's Hou&s;e at <HI>Genoa.</HI> The&s;e were Circum|&s;tances, he cou'd no ways doubt of; and as for his Voyage to <HI>Sallee,</HI> he had never been there; &s;o that he look'd on all her Reproaches as Vi&s;ionary, which threw him into a de&s;pair|ing Condition; yet he wou'd not let her per|ceive the Trouble he was in, nor what occa&s;i|on'd it, but continu'd &s;peaking to her in a very obliging manner: You do me a great deal of Wrong, Charming <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;aid he, to her &s;ighing, and I &s;hou'd not find it a very hard Task to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, tho' I fancy, I have the mo&s;t Cau&s;e to complain.

And what &s;hall I conjecture from your being at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Grand Seignior's Pa&s;&s;ion for you? <HI>Leonida</HI> heard the Prince with A&s;toni&s;hment, and thought like|wi&s;e, he knew not what he &s;aid; &s;he cou'd not imagine how a Man of &s;o good Sen&s;e cou'd talk after &s;uch an extravagant manner; and as her Affection was more predominant than her Re&s;entment, &s;he was &s;en&s;ibly griev'd at his Misfortune.

till &s;he found a fairer Opportunity of executing it.</P>
<P>After <HI>Leonida</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> had given each other reciprocal A&s;&s;urances of their Joy and Affection, they con&s;ulted, how they &s;hou'd behave them&s;elves towards the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> till they cou'd find an Opportunity of going off.

<P>As <HI>Celima</HI> was coming out of her Apart|ment, they told her, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was in the Palace, and had &s;omething of the highe&s;t Im|portance to communicate to her: She had given Orders, that no body &s;hou'd be admit|ted that Evening; yet as that Prince's Vi&s;it &s;eem'd to import &s;ome weighty matter, &s;he wou'd not refu&s;e &s;eeing him. <HI>Mahomet</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;ing the Queen, told her, that <HI>Mula,</HI> Fa|vorite to <HI>Abelhamar,</HI> was ju&s;t arriv'd from <HI>Fez,</HI> with a Letter to her from his Ma&s;ter, and that being a particular Acquaintance of his, he had apply'd to him for a private Audience, which if &s;he was pleas'd to grant, he wou'd immediately &s;end for him.

He joyn'd with <HI>Mula</HI> in his Propo&s;als, and offer'd to go him&s;elf with <HI>Felicia</HI> to <HI>Sallee,</HI> in order to bring back with him &s;uch Ho&s;tages from <HI>Abel|hamar,</HI> as &s;hou'd warrant the performance of the Treaty. <HI>Celima,</HI> with a gracious Air, re|turn'd
<PB N="363" REF="367">
<HI>Mahomet</HI> Thanks and a&s;&s;ur'd him, &s;he &s;hou'd never forget the generous manner, in which he e&s;pous'd her Intere&s;t; but as <HI>Abel|hamar</HI>'s Propo&s;als requir'd &s;ome Con&s;ideration, &s;he de&s;ired, her An&s;wer might be &s;u&s;pended till the next Day; then <HI>Mula</HI> withdrew, and left the Prince there, who took &s;o great a Plea&s;ure in entertaining the Queen, that he did not retire till it was late, which gave time to the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, to take &s;ome Mea&s;ures relating to their particular Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> having taken leave of the Queen, &s;he immediately went to the Grotto, where being enter'd, <HI>Leonida,</HI> out of Re&s;pect retir'd, and left her alone with the Prince of <HI>Carency.</HI> This lovely Captive was walking in the Wood, with her Thoughts entirely imploy'd on the Happine&s;s, &s;he propos'd to her&s;elf, thro' the means of her faithful Lover: but alas, Fate was preparing a New Tragedy; <HI>Ca&s;il|da</HI> (&s;till under a Man's Di&s;gui&s;e) di&s;tracted with Jealou&s;y, at what &s;he had ju&s;t heard, and &s;eeing her Rival walking alone, thought &s;he might ea&s;ily pierce her Heart, before any one cou'd come to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o running up to her like a Fury, &s;he drew out her Poinard, and plung'd it into <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Brea&s;t, who fell with the Blow, crying out for help, and call|ing the Prince of <HI>Carency;</HI> at which Name, <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;uch inhuman Rage, that &s;he repeated her Blows. The Grotto not being di&s;tant, the Prince was &s;truck at the mournful Accents of his wounded Mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="364" REF="368">
and leaving the Queen &s;uddenly, he made ha&s;te toward the Place where he heard <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Voice; he &s;aw her lying on the Ground bath'd in Blood, and perceiv'd <HI>Don Sanche</HI> running away, which convinc'd him that he was the Murderer; he immediately pur&s;u'd him, and with his Sword run him through: After he had thus reveng'd unfortunate <HI>Leonida,</HI> he came up to her; but oh! what a lamentable Condition did he find her in? She expre&s;s'd her&s;elf with painful Sighs, and had &s;earce Strength enough to take her Lover's Hand, which made him fear, her beauteous Eyes were going to yield up all their Charms to that univer&s;al Conqueror, Death.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I here paint the di&s;con&s;olate State of our unhappy Prince; he was re&s;olv'd not to &s;urvive &s;o great a Misfortune, and had al|ready turn'd the Point of his Sword to his Brea&s;t, when the Queen (who had follow'd him out of the Grotto) interpos'd, and preven|ted him from acting his own Death: She re|peated her Shrieks in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a manner, that the Guards immediately came up to her, and &s;oon after, mo&s;t of her Attendants, with a great Number of Flambeaux, which &s;hew'd all the Horror of this Tragick Scene. It was not long before they were inform'd of it at the Palace of <HI>Alhambro:</HI> The two Princes, <HI>Maho|met</HI> and <HI>O&s;min,</HI> came to the <HI>Abbaicyn,</HI> with <HI>Mula</HI> and another Gentleman, who had accompany|ed him in his Voyage from <HI>Sallee:</HI> In &s;hort, the Wood was full of People, who were in
<PB N="365" REF="369">
a &s;trange Con&s;ternation; <HI>Leonida</HI> wounded, (lying in the Arms of a de&s;pairing Prince, who was near lo&s;ing his Mi&s;tre&s;s) mov'd all Hearts with Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI> (that wretched Creature) was tearing open her Wounds, to ha&s;ten her de&s;erv'd Death: <HI>Zulema</HI> approach'd her, and &s;till thinking &s;he was a Man; Ah Barbarous Villain, that you are, cry'd he to her; what <HI>Daemon</HI> urg'd you to commit a Crime &s;o black? Tell me, what had innocent <HI>Felicia</HI> done to you, and how came you to murder her in this cruel manner? I am <HI>Ca&s;ilda,</HI> (reply'd &s;he with a furious Air) and &s;he was my Rival; go to your Friend, and he will tell you the re&s;t. The&s;e were the la&s;t and only Words &s;he pronounc'd with her expiring Breath.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Leonida</HI>'s Life was de&s;pair'd of, yet the Surgeons were &s;ent for, who us'd all their Skill to &s;top the bleeding of her Wounds, which they dre&s;s'd, and having a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with pro|per Remedies, her Spirits began to revive: She open'd her weak Eyes, then fix'd them on the Prince, who held her in his Arms, and appear'd in as great want of Relief, as his dying Mi&s;tre&s;s. At la&s;t they took her from him, and carry'd her by the Queen's Order to her Chamber, where &s;he was laid in Bed, and <HI>Inea,</HI> who had a tender Affection for <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;taid by her almo&s;t incon&s;olable for the unlucky Accident, which had happen'd to her illu&s;tri|ous Companion. She was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd
<PB N="366" REF="370">
at it, that even the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Don Ramire</HI> cou'd not mitigate her exce&s;&s;ive Grief. He was ju&s;t arriv'd from <HI>Fez,</HI> where he had been, in Expectation of finding his dear <HI>Inea,</HI> who had &s;ent him a Letter whil&s;t he was at <HI>Moroc|co,</HI> to acquaint him with her Captivity: But before he cou'd reach <HI>Sallee,</HI> the Queen was embark'd, which oblig'd him to wait there for a favourable Opportunity of coming over to <HI>Granada;</HI> and as about this time <HI>Mula</HI> was &s;etting out for that Kingdom, he took his Pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame Ship.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;min,</HI> who had a real Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Leonida,</HI> was thoroughly concern'd at her Misfortune; and as for the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> &s;he cou'd not help being mov'd at this di&s;mal Adventure, tho' &s;he prudently conceal'd her Thoughts. The Prince of <HI>Carency</HI>'s mournful Complaints, too well confirm'd her Su&s;picions in relation to his Sentiments for <HI>Leonida;</HI> and &s;he &s;aw him po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;o violent a De&s;pair, that &s;he had no room left for any hopes, no not even to come to an Agreement with <HI>Abelhamar;</HI> for in the fir&s;t Place, &s;he was convinc'd, that &s;hou'd <HI>Leonida</HI> die of her Wounds, her Death wou'd render his Propo&s;als of no Effect; and on the other Hand, &s;he fore&s;aw, that if &s;he recover'd, the Prince wou'd claim her as one, perhaps, he had lov'd a long time, and whom he intended to marry.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Mula,</HI> he was &s;o amaz'd, that he cou'd &s;carcely believe his own Eyes; for tho' he was pre&s;ent when his Ma&s;ter fought the
<PB N="367" REF="371">
brave Count of <HI>La Vagne,</HI> and kill'd him, and that he &s;aw him give up his la&s;t Breath in <HI>Olympia</HI>'s Arms, yet he cou'd not be per|&s;uaded, but the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> was that &s;ame Count; &s;o great was their Re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>The Prince, all this while, was like a Man who&s;e Sen&s;es had abandon'd him, and in that Condition, the Queen of <HI>Fez</HI> gave Orders, that he &s;hou'd be carry'd into one of the A|partments of the <HI>Abbaicyn,</HI> where being laid on a Bed, his Wound open'd afre&s;h, and there gu&s;h'd from it a great Quantity of Blood, which alarm'd all his Friends, particularly <HI>O&s;|min,</HI> who look'd on him as his Rival, and notwith&s;tanding, &s;hew'd a &s;incere Trouble for his Misfortune, as well as his generous Friend <HI>Zulema.</HI></P>
<P>No body cou'd now tell who was in the greate&s;t Danger, the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> or <HI>Le|onida;</HI> they both continu'd extremely ill: His exce&s;&s;ive Grief for the Condition of his beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s, retarded his Recovery, till they a&s;&s;ur'd him, there was Hopes of her Life; which agreeable News caus'd &s;o wonderful an Effect in him, that his Wound was &s;oon heal'd, and in a few Days he was able to vi&s;it her, who was al&s;o in no &s;mall Concern for the State of her Lover's Health. The Pre&s;ence of this lovely Prince had &s;o great an Influence on her, that it con|tributed likewi&s;e to her &s;peedy Recovery: His daily Attendance and tender Care gave her more Relief than all the Remedies, which
<PB N="368" REF="372">
the Surgeons apply'd to her Wounds; and it may be &s;aid, that as Love was the Author of the Pains and Di&s;a&s;ters of the&s;e con&s;tant Lovers, he was al&s;o their Phy&s;ician and Com|fort. No Satisfaction cou'd be equal to theirs, not is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive the endearing Expre&s;&s;ions, they mutually exchang'd, during their Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time it was known, thro' the means of <HI>Inea,</HI> that <HI>Leonida</HI> was Daughter to <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Zulema</HI> having mention'd <HI>Ca&s;ilda</HI>'s Name, &s;he al&s;o inform'd the Court of her being of the Family of the <HI>Benavidez's,</HI> and related to them the whole Story, as &s;he had heard it from <HI>Leonida.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI>'s Name, it was not long kept a Secret; <HI>Celima</HI> told the King of <HI>Granada</HI> who he was, which added &s;o much to the E&s;teem, he had already acquir'd, thro' his per&s;onal Merit, that he receiv'd all po&s;&s;ible Marks of Honour from the King, who went often to &s;ee him after this unhappy Ad|venture; and endeavouring to con&s;ole the Prince, among&s;t other obliging Expre&s;&s;ions, he told him, he re&s;tor'd him to his Li|berty, for which, he de&s;ired no other Ran|&s;om than his Friend&s;hip, and that had he known &s;ooner of his being of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> he wou'd have &s;hewn him all the Di&s;tinction, that was due to &s;o illu&s;trious a Family</P>
<P>The Prince, who now &s;aw <HI>Leonida</HI> out of Danger, was very willing to retrieve his Li|berty
<PB N="379" REF="373">
at any rate: He readily accepted of the King of <HI>Granada</HI>'s generous Offer, and return'd him Thanks for that, and the many other Favours he had confer'd on him, &s;ince the time he was taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Celima,</HI> notwith&s;tanding <HI>Leonida</HI> was her Rival, extremely pity'd her, and order'd that all the Attendance imaginable &s;hou'd be given her: She al&s;o vi&s;ited the Prince, who laying a&s;ide the Re&s;pect due to her Rank, receiv'd her with &s;o much Indifferency, that &s;he re|&s;olv'd never more to &s;peak to him of his Un|known of <HI>Nicopolis.</HI></P>
<P>The mean while the King of <HI>Granada</HI> (who was de&s;irous to compleat the Prince of <HI>Caren|cy</HI>'s good Fortune, and had a De&s;ign, at the &s;ame time, to oblige the <HI>Spaniards)</HI> thought on means to procure <HI>Leonida</HI> her Liberty; he therefore addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Queen of <HI>Fez,</HI> offer|ing her whatever Sum, &s;he wou'd plea&s;e to de|mand for the Ran&s;om of that young Lady: But <HI>Celima,</HI> who&s;e Greatne&s;s of Spirit was equal to her Pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;olv'd no Sovereign &s;hou'd &s;urpa&s;s her in Genero&s;ity; the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> being a Chri&s;tian, and in Love with her Slave, was enough to make her determine never to think of him more. She told the King of <HI>Granada,</HI> that far from requiring any Ran&s;om for <HI>Leonida,</HI> &s;he de&s;ired, he wou'd accept and di&s;po&s;e of her, as he thought fit; and that not only <HI>Leonida,</HI> but all the re&s;t of her Slaves were at his Command if agree|able to him. The King heard with Plea&s;ure <HI>Celima</HI>'s An&s;wer, and in his Turn, gallantly
<PB N="380" REF="374">
pre&s;ented <HI>Leonida</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> who receiv'd her with inexpre&s;&s;ible Marks of Joy and Gratitude, but cou'd not find Words to make a Retribution &s;uitable to the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The chief and only Care of the&s;e happy Lovers con&s;i&s;ted now in giving each other daily Proofs of their tender Affection. Their long and cruel Di&s;appointments made their Feli|city the greater; and tho' they were not as yet Perfectly recover'd, they were propo&s;ing Means to leave <HI>Granada,</HI> in order to perform the Promi&s;e which their Parents had made for them in their infant Years. The Prince wrote to <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> at <HI>Villa-Real,</HI> acquainting him with the Particulars of his and <HI>Leonida</HI>'s For|tune, and withal, that he hop'd &s;oon to be the happie&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Mula</HI> (&s;eeing his Ma&s;ter's De&s;igns were ren|der'd impracticable through this Adventure between the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> and <HI>Leonida)</HI> went back to <HI>Sallee,</HI> and gave <HI>Abelhamar</HI> an Account of what had pa&s;s'd; which News &s;o cruelly affected him, that the Lo&s;s of his Mi&s;|tre&s;s had like to have made him act his own Death; but as an Evincement of the Great|ne&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, he took a Re&s;olution pro|portionable to it; for having renounc'd to the Crown of <HI>Fez,</HI> he retired to a Ca&s;tle on the Sea-&s;ide, where he con&s;ecrated the Remainder of his Life to the dear Memory of his <HI>Feli|cia. Celima</HI> &s;oon receiv'd Advice of this unex|pected Change; and as <HI>Mahomet</HI> was extreme|ly &s;ollicitous to &s;erve her in &s;o favourable a
<PB N="381" REF="375">
Conjuncture, he intreated the King of <HI>Gra|nada,</HI> his Father, to give him a Fleet and &s;ome Forces, in order to rein&s;tate the Queen of <HI>Fez;</HI> which being granted, he took the Command entirely upon him&s;elf, and con|voy'd her to <HI>Sallee,</HI> where, far from meeting with any Oppo&s;ition, &s;he found all Things in a perfect Tranquility. By this time her Mind was more at Ea&s;e; for having con&s;ider'd that &s;he cou'd no longer hope to receive an obliging return to the Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he had for the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> &s;he thought nothing wou'd &s;ooner effect it's Cure, than approving <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Vows; therefore being of too haughty a Temper to bear with the Di&s;dain of the one, and Gra|titude pleading in behalf of the other, &s;he at once re&s;olv'd to give her Hand, and all her Affection to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who by this Alliance &s;aw his Love and Ambition &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P><HI>Celima,</HI> before &s;he parted from <HI>Granada,</HI> re|&s;tor'd <HI>Inea</HI> to her Liberty, and <HI>Don Ramire</HI> took her with him to <HI>Toledo,</HI> where the&s;e two Lovers, by a happy Union, receiv'd the Re|ward of their Con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>What I have farther to add relating to the Prince of <HI>Carency</HI> and <HI>Leonida,</HI> is, that as &s;oon as they were in a Condition to &s;et out on their Journey, they took leave of the King of <HI>Granada,</HI> who made them con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents, and order'd &s;everal Noblemen with a &s;trong De|tachment of his Guards to conduct them as far as the Frontiers of <HI>Spain;</HI> whence they pro|ceeded to <HI>Villa Real,</HI> where they were receiv'd
<PB N="382" REF="376">
with a Satisfaction equal to the Occa&s;ion. Their long Sufferings intitled them to &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings, as hardly any who wore the Chains of Love cou'd expect. <HI>Leonida,</HI> in whom &s;o many Perfections were a&s;&s;embled, was too great a Prize for an indifferent Heroe, and the Prince of <HI>Carency,</HI> who&s;e Accompli&s;hments render'd him one of the fine&s;t Gentlemen of his time, might ju&s;tly claim a Place in her Affection. In &s;hort, where &s;o much Virtue and Merit was united, Love mu&s;t be trium|phant. Then let us leave the Prince and <HI>Le|onida</HI> to the bounteous Care of <HI>Hymen,</HI> who&s;e &s;oft Endearments cou'd only recompence their pa&s;t Misfortunes, and crown their Days with true Felicity.</P>
