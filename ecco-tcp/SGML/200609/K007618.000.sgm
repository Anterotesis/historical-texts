<HEAD>PREFATORY DEDICATION, TO <HI>Mrs <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></HEAD>
<P>_DEdications, <HI>Madam,</HI> ought in Po|licy to be addre&s;t to the mo&s;t powerful, and in Ju&s;tice to the mo&s;t de&s;erving. The&s;e I think I have united by applying to You in this Manner, who have gain'd the former of the&s;e Advantages by means of the latter. Accompli&s;hments like Your's give the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Authority of any: I mean that over the Judgments, as well as Hearts of Mankind.</P>
<P>I intended here, <HI>Madam,</HI> after the Man|ner of other well-meaning Dedicators, to have given &s;ome Sketches of Your Cha|racter. Not &s;o much from the O&s;tenta|tion of my Art in de&s;cribing, as of the peculiar Diligence I have u&s;ed in ob&s;erv|ing it. An indifferent Painter may trace &s;ome Features of his Sov'reign's Face, who&s;e Loyalty has render'd him accurate in &s;tudying the Original&mdash;Be&s;ides, 'Twere

hard a Lady of Your Perfections &s;hou'd be the only one exempted from the Plea&s;ure of being acquainted with 'em. 'Tis true, You have a quick Eye, and penetrating Judgment in di&s;tingui&s;hing both natural, and moral Beauties: But You mu&s;t inevi|tably remain a Stranger to the greate&s;t, were it not for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e im|portant Uten&s;ils, a Poet and a Looking|Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>'Twere dangerous indeed You might &s;uffer by any Repre&s;entation I am capable of. But 'twas not Incapacity alone di&s;|courag'd me. There is &s;omething in Your Character va&s;tly di&s;advantageous to any that attempts it. To proclaim You po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of every imaginable good Quality, wou'd be &s;aying it was Day, when the Sun &s;hines in its Meridian. As for Your Faults, (if You have any,) they indeed are far enough from being liable to the former Exception: but the extreme Difficulty I &s;hou'd have found in &s;electing a few minute ones, (And &s;ome I mu&s;t have &s;elected, if po&s;&s;ible, as the Shades of my <HI>Piece</HI>;) together with the &s;mall Share of Credit I &s;hou'd have gain'd in the World, di&s;-hearten'd me. Such indeed were my only Objections. Unle&s;s I may adjoin this, that to Strangers your real and genuine Character mu&s;t have
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="y">
pa&s;s'd for Flattery. I &s;ay to Strangers, for, where you are known, You mu&s;t be acknowledg'd incapable of it: As the Sun's Brightne&s;s can be &s;et off by no Allu|&s;ion. Hence, in &s;hort, I laid a&s;ide all thoughts of a Portraiture. Tho&s;e, that wou'd love You as You de&s;erve, mu&s;t know You; as nece&s;&s;arily, as tho&s;e, who know You, mu&s;t con&s;equently love You.</P>
<P>As to the Poetry, I beg Leave to de|clare, that 'tis the Product of a young Ge|nius, little exercis'd in Ver&s;ification. And the Mu&s;es, you know, <HI>Madam,</HI> are not like a great many of their Sex, that have the mo&s;t E&s;teem for tho&s;e, who neglect them; tho' they have had &s;ometimes, in Appearance. <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> (whom to you I wou'd chu&s;e to mention) have at|tended them whole Mornings at their <HI>Toi|lette,</HI> that they might conduct them into the World, in a more agreeable Undre&s;s. But my Negligences, <HI>Madam,</HI> are of &s;uch a Nature, that I mu&s;t beg you'd impute them to Di&s;u&s;e and Inexperience. How|ever, by this Confe&s;&s;ion, I may proba|bly put you in Mind of a Lady, who, having thrum'd over a Spinnet for a con|&s;iderable Space, without the lea&s;t &s;hew of Harmony, took much pains to prove &s;he had never play'd before. 'Tis with an
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Author much the &s;ame as with a Sports|man; <HI>Hippolitus</HI> may excu&s;e his Ill-&s;ucce&s;s to him&s;elf, and, perhaps ju&s;tly alledge &s;e|veral alleviating Circum&s;tances; But in vain may he attempt his vindication to the World. That has been &s;o frequently de|luded by the&s;e Apologies, that it has made it a Rule to fix the Fault upon the Marks|man.</P>
<P>I indeed ever de&s;pair'd of affording much entertainment this way to a Lady of your refin'd Ta&s;te: And I'm po&s;itive, that Indolence, has with me prov'd, and always will do, more than a Ballance to any <HI>other</HI> Ambition. This is my only Encou|ragement, that, as one almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly con|forms to a ta&s;te one very much admires, I can't but think the&s;e Trifles won't prove ab&s;olutely di&s;agreeable to Your's.</P>
<P>You'll perhaps find other Names in the&s;e Pages, than that, which includes all that's agreeable, and is indeed the mo&s;t compre|hen&s;ive word that is; I mean your own. But as there is &s;ome thing mean in an aver|&s;ion to the Prai&s;es of another, or a con|tinual Apprehen&s;ion of being rival'd, which I take to be it's original; I'm &s;ecure of giving You no unea&s;ine&s;s. E&s;pecially, &s;ince a Lady of Your Merit may give all others infinitely more than their due, without the lea&s;t Shadow of Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
I ask Pardon for the Pedantry of Latin Mottoes and Quotations: But You may ea|&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with the lo&s;s of them, whether You con&s;ider them, merely as a Compliance with cu&s;tom, or as certain &s;craps of Anti|quity, to indemnify the Poet with tho&s;e Critic's, who approve only what's ancient. As there are &s;ome, who fix a tutelary Piece of Iron on their Thre&s;holds, to elude the Fury of Ill-de&s;igning <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the happine&s;s of being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Merit, is to &s;hew one's Approbation of tho&s;e who are; And this is really no &s;mall addition to a Man's Character. So that, &s;hou'd the&s;e Papers appear ever &s;o ridicu|lous, I &s;hall value them on <HI>one</HI> Account; And &s;hou'd their Fame prove equal to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, I &s;hou'd value them on none &s;o much as <HI>that</HI>; which is, that they enable me to declare openly how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>VERSES to a LADY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Together with &s;ome Colour'd Patterns of <HI>Flowers.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THO' rude the Draughts, tho' artle&s;s &s;eem the Lines,</L>
<L>From one unskill'd in Ver&s;e, or in <HI>De&s;igns</HI>;</L>
<L>Oft' has <HI>Good-Nature</HI> been the Fool's Defence,</L>
<L>And <HI>hone&s;t Meaning</HI> gilded Want of Sen&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear not, tho' Flow'rs and Beauty grace my Lay,</L>
<L>To prai&s;e one Fair, <HI>another</HI> &s;hall decay.</L>
<L>No <HI>Lilly,</HI> bright with painted Foliage, here,</L>
<L>Shall only langui&s;h, when <HI>Selinda's</HI> near:</L>
<L>A Fate revers'd no &s;miling <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> &s;hall know,</L>
<L>Nor with reflected Lu&s;tre doubly glow&mdash;</L>
<L>Prai&s;es, which langui&s;h, when apply'd to You,</L>
<L>Where flatt'ring Schemes &s;eem obviou&s;ly true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;ure your <HI>Sex</HI> is near to Flow'rs ally'd,</L>
<L>Alike in Softne&s;s, and alike in Pride:</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="74">
Foes to retreat, and ever fond to &s;hine,</L>
<L>Both ru&s;h to Danger, and the Shades decline;</L>
<L>Expos'd, the &s;hort-liv'd Pageants of a Day,</L>
<L>To painted Flies, or glitt'ring Pops a Prey:</L>
<L>Chang'd with each Wind, nor one &s;hort Day the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Each clouded Sky affects their tender Frame.</L>
<L>In glaring <HI>Chloe's</HI> man-like Ta&s;te and Mien,</L>
<L>Are the gro&s;s &s;plendors of the <HI>Tulip</HI> &s;een:</L>
<L>Di&s;tant they &s;trike, inelegantly gay,</L>
<L>To the near View no plea&s;ing Charms di&s;play.</L>
<L>To form the Nymph a vulgar Wit mu&s;t join,</L>
<L>As coar&s;er Soils will mo&s;t the Flow'r refine.</L>
<L><HI>Ophelia's</HI> Beauties let the <HI>Ja&s;mine</HI> paint,</L>
<L>Too faintly &s;oft, too nicely elegant.</L>
<L>Around, with &s;eeming Sanctity, endu'd,</L>
<L>The <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-flow'r</HI> may be&s;t expre&s;s the Prude.</L>
<L>Like the gay <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> too rigid <HI>Silvia</HI> &s;hines,</L>
<L>While, like it's guardian Thorn, her Virtue joins&mdash;</L>
<L>Happy the Nymph! from all their Failures free,</L>
<L>Happy the Nymph! in whom their Charms agree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Faint <HI>the&s;e Productions,</HI> till you bid di&s;clo&s;e,</L>
<L>The <HI>Pink</HI> new Splendors, and fre&s;h Tints the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI>:</L>
<L>And yet condemn not trivial Draughts like the&s;e,</L>
<L>Form'd to improve, and make ev'n Trifles plea&s;e.</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="75">
A Pow'r like Your's minuter Beauties warms,</L>
<L>And yet can bla&s;t the mo&s;t a&s;piring Charms:</L>
<L>Thus at the Rays whence other Objects &s;hine,</L>
<L>The Taper &s;ickens, and it's Flames decline.</L>
<L>When by your Art the purple <HI>Vi'let</HI> lives,</L>
<L>And the pale <HI>Lilly</HI> &s;prightlier Charms receives:</L>
<L><HI>Garters</HI> to me &s;hall glow inferiour far,</L>
<L>And with le&s;s plea&s;ing Lu&s;tre &s;hine the <HI>Star.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let &s;erious Triflers, fond of Wealth or Fame,</L>
<L>On Toils, like the&s;e, be&s;tow too &s;oft a Name;</L>
<L>Each gentler Art with wi&s;e Indiff'rence view,</L>
<L>And &s;corn one Trifle, millions to pur&s;ue:</L>
<L>More artful I, their &s;pecious Schemes deride,</L>
<L>Fond to plea&s;e you, by you in the&s;e employ'd;</L>
<L>A nobler Task, or more &s;ublime De&s;ire</L>
<L>Ambition ne'er cou'd form, nor Pride in&s;pire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sweets of tranquil Life, and rural Ea&s;e</L>
<L>Amu&s;e &s;ecurely, nor le&s;s ju&s;tly plea&s;e.</L>
<L>Where gentle <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> &s;hews her milder Pow'r,</L>
<L>Or blooms in Fruit, or &s;parkles in the Flow'r;</L>
<L>Smiles in the Groves, the raptur'd Poet's Theme,</L>
<L>Flows in the Brook, his <HI>Naiad</HI> of the Stream;</L>
<L>Dawns, with each happier Stroke the Pencil gives,</L>
<L>And, in each livelier Image, &s;miling lives;</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="76">
Is heard, when <HI>Silvia</HI> &s;trikes the warbling Strings,</L>
<L><HI>Selinda</HI> &s;peaks, or <HI>Philomela</HI> &s;ings:</L>
<L>Breaths with the Morn; attends, propitious Maid,</L>
<L>The ev'ning Ramble, and the noon-day Glade;</L>
<L>Some vi&s;ionary Fair &s;he cheats our View,</L>
<L>Then only vig'rous, when &s;he's &s;een like You.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Nature &s;ome for &s;prightlier Joys de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>For brighter Scenes, with nicer Care, refin'd.</L>
<L>When the gay Jewel radiant Streams &s;upplies,</L>
<L>And vivid Brilliants meet your brighter Eyes;</L>
<L>When Dre&s;s and Pomp around the Fancy play,</L>
<L>By Fortune's dazling Beauties born away:</L>
<L>When Theatres for you the Scenes forego,</L>
<L>And the Box bows, ob&s;equiou&s;ly low:</L>
<L>How dull the Plan which Indolence has drawn,</L>
<L>The mo&s;&s;y Grotto, or the &s;low'ry Lawn!</L>
<L>Tho' ro&s;eate Scents in ev'ry Wind exhale,</L>
<L>And &s;ilvan Warblers charm in ev'ry Gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of the&s;e be HER'S the Choice, whom all approve,</L>
<L>And whom, but tho&s;e who envy, all mu&s;t love:</L>
<L>By Nature model'd, by Experience taught,</L>
<L>To know, and pity ev'ry female Fault:</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="77">
Pleas'd ev'n to hear her Sex's Virtuews &s;hewn,</L>
<L>And blind to none's Perfections, but her own:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t, humble Fair! of <HI>the&s;e</HI> too few &s;he knows,</L>
<L>Yet owns too many for the World's Repo&s;e:</L>
<L>From Wit's wild Petulance &s;erenely free,</L>
<L>Yet ble&s;t in all that Nature can decree,</L>
<L>Not like a Fire, which, whil&s;t it burns, alarms;</L>
<L>A mode&s;t Flame, that gently &s;hines and warms;</L>
<L>Who&s;e Mind, in ev'ry Light, can Charms di&s;play,</L>
<L>With Wi&s;dom &s;erious, and with Humour gay;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as her Eyes in each bright Po&s;ture warm,</L>
<L>And fiercely &s;trike, or langui&s;hingly charm:</L>
<L>Such are your Honours&mdash;mention'd to your Co&s;t,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e lea&s;t can hear them, who de&s;erve them mo&s;t:</L>
<L>Yet ah! forgive&mdash;the le&s;s inventive Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>If e'er &s;he &s;ing, a copious Theme mu&s;t chu&s;e.</L>
