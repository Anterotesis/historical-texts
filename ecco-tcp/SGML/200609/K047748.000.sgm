<HEAD>An Humble DEDICATION TO THE Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CLARISSIMI &amp; DOCTISSIMI,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Famous Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> having been, of all the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Europe,</HI> the mo&s;t Anci|ent, and, for many A|ges, the mo&s;t celebrated Fountain of Learning, the Seat of the Mu&s;es, the Honour of the Prote&s;tant World, and the particular Glory of <HI>Great Britain</HI>: The Author of the&s;e Sheets comes prepar'd to lay this Tract at her Feet, with all the Decency and
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Re&s;pect, that the mo&s;t affectionate Duty of an Admirer of Virtue and Li|terature can oblige him to.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, and from the Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice to &s;o Learned and Excellent a Society, he grounds this Dedication upon an A&s;&s;urance, next to a Demon|&s;tration, that nothing like what com|mon Fame has &s;landerou&s;ly loaded this famous Body with, can be her Due; that it is not po&s;&s;ible, without the mo&s;t manife&s;t Inju&s;tice, to fix &s;uch things upon the Univer&s;ity, as are, at this Time, wickedly alledg'd by her enrag'd Enemies; and that therefore it is every hone&s;t Man's Duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t in her Vindication.</P>
<P>As nothing is more certain, &s;o nothing is more plea&s;ing to tho&s;e, who honour and wi&s;h well to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> than to hear, that the &s;aid Univer|&s;ity has always been a con&s;tant A&s;&s;erter of loyal Principles, and a deep Sufferer for her &s;teddy Adherence in Practice to tho&s;e Principles, always di&s;tingui&s;h|ing her&s;elf by her Loyalty to her So|vereign in the wor&s;t of Times: Hi|&s;tory is full of the Particulars; there we read with Plea&s;ure, how &s;he has frequently &s;trip'd her &s;elf of her Orna|ments,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to &s;upply the Nece&s;&s;ities of her Princes; and &s;uffered &s;everal Sieges, and various Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in Defence of the Monarchy, in the Times of Rebel|lion and U&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Her Churches, and the &s;everal Chappels of her Colleges, have con|&s;tantly re&s;ounded with the learned Di&s;cour&s;es of the Heads of Hou&s;es, Fellows, Graduates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Defence of tho&s;e ancient and orthodox Doctrines, of Submi&s;&s;ion to our lawful Sovereigns, being &s;ubject to the higher Powers for Con&s;cience &s;ake; and of their Ab|horrence of that damnable Po&s;ition, <HI>That it is lawful, upon any Pretence what|&s;oever, to take up Arms again&s;t the King.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be pleaded again&s;t her, without great Inju&s;tice, as I hear it is now, that this was the U&s;age in <HI>Ox|ford</HI> &s;everal Years ago; but that &s;he has intermitted the &s;ame, and profe&s;t other Principles &s;ince; on the contrary, it is affirm'd, that &s;he never deviated from the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of a due ab&s;olute Subjection to her Kings; and we can|not believe, that &s;he can have forgot to practi&s;e conformable to the &s;aid Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and therefore it &s;eems the more rea&s;onable to expo&s;e, at this Time,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the Attempts which &s;ome People make, to lay Reproach and Scandal upon her, as if &s;he, or any of her Body, had a|vowedly acted undutifully to our pre|&s;ent Sovereign, rai&s;ed Tumults, Mobbs, and Rebellion; Things &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Rule, &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to the Principles of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, and, particularly, of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; to all which the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> has been, and is &s;till, e&s;teemed &s;o great an Ornament, that it cannot, without great want of Charity, be &s;ugge&s;ted, that the &s;aid Univer&s;ity has any Ways been con|cerned that way.</P>
<P>Permit therefore, Reverend and Learned, that an humble Advocate for your injur'd Reputation &s;hould expo&s;tulate with your Enemies, on the Inju&s;tice they offer you, when they propagate &s;uch &s;candalous things, as are daily &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t you, and again&s;t the Honour and Reputation of your Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>AS IF you were now le&s;s loyal, and le&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the higher Powers than formerly.</P>
<P>AS IF you had forgotten your pro|fe&s;t Principles of Obedience, or could
<PB N="7" REF="6">
di&s;pence with the Conformity of your Practice to your Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS IF the Univer&s;ity was capable of being corrrupted with Faction; or were le&s;s loyal and dutiful to King <HI>George,</HI> than they were to Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>AS IF it were po&s;&s;ible, the Conta|gion of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> (which is Perjury) could infect the Univer&s;ity; or that the Sons of the Prophets could thus commence Children of Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>AS IF it were po&s;&s;ible, that the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> could be tainted with Rellellion, <HI>which is as the Sin of Witchcraft.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things, I am &s;atisfy'd, can never be; it cannot con&s;i&s;t with com|mon Charity to think, much le&s;s to prompt others to think, &s;o ab&s;urdly of &s;o glorious a Body of Men, illuminated with the &s;ublime&s;t Knowledge, divine and humane; in&s;tructed by a Succe&s;|&s;ion of Learned, Pious, and truly Re|verend Divines; and openly profe&s;&s;ing Principles diametrically oppo&s;ite to what they are now charg'd with.</P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>Excellent and Vene|rable</HI>! permit the Author, in this De|dication, briefly to enter into the Par|ticulars
<PB N="8" REF="7">
from whence the&s;e Sugge&s;tions are maliciou&s;ly drawn; and from thence, how ea&s;y will it be to &s;hew the Improbability there is, that the Univer&s;ity &s;hould be in the lea&s;t con|cern'd in, or guilty of the Facts laid to her Charge.</P>
<P><HI>As fir&s;t,</HI> The black Charge of Riots and Tumults in the Streets of the Uni|ver&s;ity; breaking the King's Peace; and turning the u&s;ual A&s;&s;embly of the learned Members of the Univer&s;ity, &s;uch as, Students, Graduates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into a Rabble, a Rout, a rebellious and tumultuous Mobb.</P>
<P>Such is the good Government of the Univer&s;ity in general; &s;uch the ri|gorous Execution of their private and &s;tatutary Laws; &s;uch the Hone&s;ty and Vigilance of the Reverend the <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI>; &s;uch the Fidelity and Dili|gence of the Under-Officers of the U|niver&s;ity; all concurring as well to re|&s;train, as to re&s;ent, that it is well known, how impracticable &s;uch a thing is; that it cannot be; that the Power of the &s;aid <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> is &s;uch, in cau&s;ing the Doors of the Colleges to be kept &s;hut, and a &s;trict Account to be taken of all the Students, both
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of the Egre&s;s and Regre&s;s, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for any to be ab&s;ent; or if any are, they may be publickly and &s;everely call'd to an Account for the &s;ame: Seeing then that, on all the mo&s;t &s;trict Enquiries which have been made, &s;o few have been found out, and puni&s;h'd for being ab&s;ent from their Chambers at the Time of the &s;aid Riot, it mu&s;t certainly follow, <HI>un|deniably follow</HI>! that if there was any &s;uch Riot and Tumult in the Streets of <HI>Oxford,</HI> it mu&s;t be made by, and made up of the Rabbles and People of the Town, the <HI>Canaille,</HI> and the Crowds of the Villages adjacent, and the like; and that not one Scholar of the Town was among them; for if there had, it cannot be doubted, but the <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> by his known Vigi|lance and Diligence, and his irre&s;i&s;tible Authority, COULD have detected them, and have <HI>ru&s;ticated,</HI> or other|wi&s;e expos'd them all as they de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is then farther alledg'd, that the Per&s;ons, of whom the&s;e riotous A&s;&s;em|blies were compos'd, committed di|vers Sorts of Violences; &s;uch as break|ing Windows, pulling down Bonefires
<PB N="10" REF="9">
built up for publick Rejoicings, on the Day of the King's Birth, Acce&s;&s;ion, or Coronation, or on Days appointed for Thank&s;giving for &s;uch things as tho&s;e; and after this, to march in an arm'd and violent Manner, and pull down and demoli&s;h the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e,</HI> or Place of religious Wor&s;hip, belonging to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> Alas, how do Men give them&s;elves a Liberty to fall upon, and to a&s;per&s;e the mo&s;t innocent and inoffen&s;ive of their Brethren? Can it be rational to believe, that a Body of Gentlemen, many of them of Qua|lity, mo&s;t of them of good Families, and all of them of good Proficiency in Breeding and Manners, entred into particular Societies for Learning, for poli&s;hing their Under&s;tandings, for a|dorning their Souls with Principles of Religion and Virtue, with Rules for good Manners, to qualify them for Gentlemen, and for In&s;tructors of o|thers? Is it po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, that the&s;e can be guilty of the <HI>Street-Madne&s;s</HI> here talked of, and can deviate into Mobbs and Rabbles! It cannot be! It is not rational to &s;ugge&s;t it of them! Again, when we call to mind, that the Stu|dents of the Univer&s;ity are, generally,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
made up of &s;uch as have &s;et their Faces towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; who have the Temple and the Altar in their View, and are learning the divine Stile of the Pulpit; that are to &s;erve at the Altar, and mini&s;ter in holy Things; is it rea&s;onable to imagine, that the&s;e can &s;ink into Clamour and Tumult, and di&s;honour their Dignity &s;o far, as to herd in with the Di&s;turbers of the Civil Peace? It can never be! we can|not, we mu&s;t not believe it.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the mo&s;t pure Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> preach'd upon all Occa&s;ions by her mo&s;t Reverend Divines, and practis'd in Times of the greate&s;t Extremity, by her mo&s;t &s;incere Di&s;ciples, is a &s;acred Pattern of Obedience to the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate, as to the Power which is or|dained of God; and the breaking out into Riot and Tumult, <HI>which is Rebel|lion,</HI> is as incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;aid Do|ctrine of the Church, that the Church her&s;elf has, in all Ages, held &s;uch in Abomination, who have thought fit to break into &s;uch unchri&s;tian Cour&s;es; maintaining, with her utmo&s;t Endea|vour, that ble&s;&s;ed Scripture-Rule le&s;t upon Record by St. <HI>Paul, Let every</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>Soul be &s;ubject to the higher Powers.</HI> This then having been the avowed Principle of Obedience, profe&s;s'd in, and own'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> we humbly appeal to you, Excellent and Learned, the Heads, Fellows, Gradu|ates, and Students of the famous Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> whether we ought, in Ju&s;tice or Charity, to believe that any Members of your Body, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are preparing them&s;elves for the Service of the holy Altar, can be guilty of &s;uch &s;candalous Crimes, as tho&s;e of Rabble, Tumult, breaking the Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or that, if they were, tho&s;e Offences would not meet with the utmo&s;t Re&s;entment, and &s;evere&s;t Puni&s;hment from tho&s;e, who&s;e Duty it is to take Cognizance thereof.</P>
<P>It cannot but be grateful to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to remind the Reader of the&s;e Sheets, that with|in tho&s;e &s;acred Walls have, for many Ages, been profe&s;&s;ed, preached, and, to the immortal Glory of the Univer|&s;ity, been practis'd, tho&s;e mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian and Heavenly Doctrines of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI>; and that in their full and mo&s;t extended Sen&s;e and Meaning: and it would be
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the ab&s;urde&s;t thing in the World for us to &s;ugge&s;t, that the Profe&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e &s;ublime Principles can be guilty of any thing &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite thereto; as is the mobbing together, again&s;t Law, and again&s;t the Power of the Legal Magi&s;trate, which is indeed no le&s;s than again&s;t the King him&s;elf; and therefore we can by no means think any other, but that all the Re|ports we have had of the&s;e things, are meer Forgeries, and fictitious Stories, contrived by the Enemies of our holy Mother the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to brand her mo&s;t obedient Sons with the mo&s;t hateful of Crimes, and which are mo&s;t repugnant to her E&s;tabli&s;hment, and profe&s;t Doctrine.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as the Charge de&s;cends to yet greater and greater Offences, &s;o much &s;tronger are the Arguments again&s;t our entertaining any Su&s;picion of their being true: Even as <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> in his <HI>Spartan</HI> Con&s;titution, omitted Laws again&s;t certain Crimes, as what he would not &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible his Citizens could commit; with what Face can the Enemies of your mo&s;t Reverend Body, pretend to make mention of the Extravagancies of the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
common People, in falling upon their Brethren and Neighbours, meerly for their profe&s;&s;ing to &s;erve God in &s;ome manner differing from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Rites; and with Violence, and the ru|de&s;t kind of Per&s;ecution, pull down and demoli&s;h their Chappel, or Meeting|Hou&s;e; notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame are allow'd to them by the Law, and are legally qualify'd; that the poor, ignorant, deluded, and abu&s;ed People, the <HI>Plebeii</HI> of the City, and the adjacent Villages, might, in the Heat of an en|rag'd Multitude, and, perhaps, intoxi|cated by Liquor, run upon things &s;o extravagant and unchri&s;tian, I will not di&s;pute; but, to be &s;ure, not one Member of the <HI>famous &V;niver&s;ity of OXFORD</HI> could be &s;o weak, &s;o ig|norant, or &s;o wicked, as to be found in the Streets at that Time.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, Heaven forbid, &s;o uncharitable a Thought &s;hould be har|bour'd in any Man's Brea&s;t, that calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian. Good God! What, Men of Religion to demoli&s;h Places of Wor&s;hip; Men breeding up for the Pulpit, to make a Bonefire of Pulpits; Men &s;et apart to &s;erve at the Altar, to pull down Altars! It is impo&s;&s;ible;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
What, the Sons of the Prophets thus become Sons of <HI>Belial?</HI> It can never be; Sure no Chri&s;tian can believe it without Breach of the great Rule of Chri&s;tian Charity, and that in an un|u&s;ual Manner; when, I &s;ay, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to believe the&s;e things, and it cannot be true, and we can by no means entertain &s;uch thoughts; it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without, at the &s;ame Time, branding the Univer&s;ity with the black|e&s;t Mark of Infamy; and believing her degenerated to all that is vile and contemptible; believing the be&s;t con|&s;tituted Foundations to be converted into a Rabble of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and the mo&s;t excellent College-Government, to be deviated into the wor&s;t kind of Confu&s;ion; &s;uppo&s;ing the Beauty and Comeline&s;s of that mo&s;t excellent Se|minary of Learning to be defac'd; all the Order and Oeconomy of the re|&s;pective Hou&s;es, inverted and over|whelm'd; their Pretences to Religion, &s;hamefully abandoned; their Claim to a well-order'd Society, given up; their Di&s;cipline neglected; and, in a Word, the whole Univer&s;ity de&s;cended to a Crowd; Government di&s;&s;olv'd; Sub|ordination,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
which is the very Fabrick of Order, blended with Superiority, and both together &s;unk into the wor&s;t Di&s;order; the Church of <HI>England</HI> turn'd Rebels; Prote&s;tants, turn'd Per&s;ecu|tors; and the mo&s;t famous Seminary of Religion, turn'd a Ne&s;t of Pha|naticks.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Excellent and Reverend, that &s;ome Warmth mo&s;t naturally at|tends &s;uch a Thought as this; it is only by the livelie&s;t De&s;cription of what the&s;e Crimes would produce, to evince the Truth of what I have advanc'd in your Defence; and to &s;hew, how rea&s;onable it is that we &s;hould not, in any kind, give Credit to the &s;candalous Stories, which your Enemies &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t you.</P>
<P>I come now to the mo&s;t malicious of all the Reflections yet made; and this is, their fathering the Voice of the Rabble upon the Univer&s;ity; mak|ing the learned Students of your Col|leges join in with the Shouts of the <HI>Pea&s;ants</HI> and <HI>Boors,</HI> and fouling their Mouths with the cour&s;e Jargon of the Street, crying, an <HI>Ormond,</HI> an <HI>Ormond</HI>; no <HI>King George</HI>; <HI>High-Church,</HI> &amp;c. and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
I &s;hould not care to repeat Words &s;o ungrateful to loyal Ears, were I not well &s;atisfy'd, that the Members of your Honourable Society were not capable of being &s;o far demented, not capable of uttering Words &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with common Sen&s;e, as well as with common Manners; and that I may the more effectually vindicate the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> from the Sugge&s;tion, I need do no more, than to enquire into the Rationality of the&s;e Exclamations; for if I prove the Words to have neither Con&s;i&s;tency, Hone&s;ty, or Meaning, I hope no Body will contend about the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI>'s being in the lea&s;t concern'd in them.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, fir&s;t, That, in the very Connection of the Words, a certain Oppo&s;ition is plac'd between the Center, and the two Extremes; (1.) <HI>Ormond, Ormond</HI>; no <HI>King George:</HI> (2.) Take them the other Way, <HI>No King</HI> George; <HI>High-Church.</HI></P>
<P>So that, in &s;hort, King <HI>George</HI> is placed in direct Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Ormond,</HI> and in direct Oppo&s;ition to <HI>High-Church</HI>; and, which is &s;till more extraordinary, <HI>Ormond</HI> and <HI>High-Church</HI> are both plac'd in Oppo&s;ition to King <HI>George:</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Now we all know, that this is no U|niver&s;ity Language; the Learned and Reverend Members of your &s;everal Colleges u&s;e quite another Dialect. King <HI>George</HI> being legally enthron'd, crown'd by the lawful Authority of the Kingdom, is now become the Lord's Anointed as much, and as effe|ctually, as any of his Predece&s;&s;ors; and as &s;uch, has been recogniz'd by the Univer&s;ity; and now to cry, <HI>No King GEORGE,</HI> is to make their Loyalty a meer <HI>Witch</HI>'s Prayer, ring their Bells backward, and rai&s;e Rebellion again&s;t their only lawful Sovereign.</P>
<P>Now it can never be thought, that the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> can do thus, unle&s;s we &s;hall own, &s;he is turn'd <HI>Phanatick</HI>; has embrac'd the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principles of 41; and is actually en|gag'd in Rebellion, to depo&s;e the Lord's Anointed, and bring their law|ful Sovereign to De&s;truction; for we have always allow'd, that to rai&s;e War again&s;t our Sovereign, and to kill, mur|ther, and de&s;troy the Sovereign, differ not at all in the Trea&s;on; and have no other &s;pecifick Difference, than there is between the Endeavour, which is Trea&s;on in the overt-Act;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and the Perpetration, which is Trea&s;on compleated.</P>
<P>Sure it cannot be call'd a Compli|ment to the Univer&s;ity, to believe &s;he cannot be guilty of any thing &s;o un|natural as this, &s;o contrary to her a|vow'd Principles, and &s;teddy Practice for many Ages.</P>
<P>As to the Name of <HI>Ormond,</HI> which has been the Catch-word of the Rabble, in the &s;everal Street-tumults which have, of late, &s;o much di&s;turb'd the Nation, there is &s;o much incongruous Non&s;en&s;e in the Cry, that it has help'd to make tho&s;e Mobbs odious and hate|ful to the Country; and has &s;hewn the People, that they have none to look to beyond the King upon the Throne; for why do they cry, an <HI>Or|mond,</HI> an <HI>Ormond</HI>; they will not pre|tend, that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> makes any Claim to the Crown; if then they have any one to talk of next to the King, why do they not name him? This they dare not do; becau&s;e that would be to own fairly what they mean, <HI>the Pretender</HI>; and this, openly profe&s;t, would open the Peoples Eyes too &s;oon; for did they openly and a|vowedly cry out, <HI>the Pretender</HI>; <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<HI>Pretender</HI>; <HI>no King GEORGE</HI>; <HI>no Ha|nover</HI>; I &s;ay, would they cry thus, their own Mobb would for&s;ake them; and therefore having nothing el&s;e to &s;ay, they cry, <HI>Ormond, Ormond,</HI> whether with a Meaning, or without a Mean|ing, that they may have &s;omething to fill the Mouths of the People with; for to have a Mobb, and no <HI>Halloo,</HI> would be a Mobb and no Mobb, and would &s;ignify nothing; for Rabbles are always rais'd by Murmur, and kept alive by Shouts; Noi&s;e is as e&s;&s;ential to a Mobb, as Ammunition is to an Ar|my, they could do nothing without.</P>
<P>But certainly this can never be the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford!</HI> We all know the Veneration the Univer&s;ity has for <HI>Ormond,</HI> and how entirely they are in his per&s;onal Intere&s;t; and they cannot be ignorant of his late Grace's pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, and the Mi&s;chief &s;uch U&s;e made of his Name would be to him; how it would &s;uppo&s;e him, ei|ther to be for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or to have the Vanity to accept of this Elevation of his Name by the Mobb, in Oppo&s;i|tion to the King; and &s;o to &s;et up for a Pretender him&s;elf; which would be equally ridiculous, and, in the End, e|qually
<PB N="21" REF="20">
fatal to him: Nor can the Uni|ver&s;ity be ignorant, how this would expo&s;e him to the &s;uperiour Power of his Enemies; and put the Government to the Nece&s;&s;ity of pro&s;ecuting him for tho&s;e other Things, in which they were before enclin'd to &s;hew him Fa|vour; how it &s;eems to &s;et a Subject in Competition with his Sovereign, and make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cru&s;h him, for that dangerous Popularity which other Men put upon him, whe|ther it be with his Con&s;ent or no. Now the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who have &s;o entire an Affection for the Per&s;on of their late <HI>Chancellor,</HI> cannot, without great Inju&s;tice, be &s;uppos'd &s;o uncon|cern'd for his Safety, and &s;o little in|tere&s;ted in him, as to expo&s;e him to &s;o ju&s;t a Reproach, as this would bring upon him.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, to do the late Duke a piece of Ju&s;tice, which he &s;o much &s;tands in need of at this Time; I have been credibly inform'd, that he received the Account of the&s;e things with a ju&s;t Indignation; that he di&s;|own'd it in every Part; that he pote&s;t|ed openly, it was what he abhorr'd; and was &s;o far from approving, that he

hop'd all his Friends would clear him of having any Concern in it; and, a|bove all, that he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf par|ticularly pleas'd and &s;atisfy'd, when it was told him, that the Univer&s;ity was not in the lea&s;t to be &s;uppos'd to be concern'd in it; and that his Grace's Opinion was the &s;ame as ours is, and as all others mu&s;t be, who are Friends to the Univer&s;ity, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Uni|ver&s;ity could not be &s;o di&s;tracted; it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But to leave his Grace to prote&s;t a|gain&s;t it; thus mobbing his Name in the Streets, and entituling him to a Crime wor&s;e than the greate&s;t of tho&s;e, for which he already &s;tands impeach'd; I cannot but engage a little in Behalf of the Univer&s;ity, as to the other Cry; <HI>No Hanover, no King GEORGE</HI>; <HI>High-Church, High-Church.</HI></P>

would give the true Etimology of them, as they are now made u&s;e of; nor would it a little contribute to the enlightening the World in that Matter, on this eminent Occa&s;ion; and e&s;peci|ally to vindicate the Univer&s;ity her &s;elf, from many wicked and malicious Calumnies, by which her Enemies think to charge her with being in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Now, whe|ther the Words <HI>HIGH CH&V;RCH,</HI> as now u&s;ed, are &s;ynonimous to the Words <HI>Popery, right Line, indefea&s;ible, hereditary Right</HI>; and &s;o are to be under&s;tood, that <HI>High-Church</HI> are for the <HI>Pretender</HI>; or whether they are otherwi&s;e to be under&s;tood; and how is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be otherwi&s;e under&s;tood?

<P>To leave therefore the Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, and leave the ridiculous Jargon of the Mobb, to the ju&s;t Cen|&s;ure of the Univer&s;ity; it remains on|ly to mention the &s;aid Tumults, with the &s;ame ju&s;t Abhorrence that the &s;aid

<P>_IF illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors, high Birth, a capital For|tune, glorious Titles, and the true Merit of a long Race of Men, be|lov'd by their Princes, and by their Country, were the things by which the Character of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> was now to be &s;et forth, our Bu&s;ine&s;s would be to look into the Hi&s;tory, not of the Duke him&s;elf, but of his noble and illu&s;tri|ous Hou&s;e; and to lay down, not on|ly a Line of their noble De&s;cent, but a long Detail of their glorious Actions; in which it mu&s;t, in Ju&s;tice, be own'd, that the pre&s;ent Duke has as much to value him&s;elf upon, as mo&s;t Families of the Nobility can boa&s;t of.</P>

<L>Fir&s;t, Sir, &s;ome Honour of your own acquire.</L></Q>
<P>And, fir&s;t, to the Honour of his fir&s;t Appearance in the Field, we find his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> one of the fir&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, who ap|pear'd Volunteer in the Field in the fir&s;t War again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; where he made his fir&s;t Campaign under the truly-Glorious King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>If the Example of &s;uch a King, and His Maje&s;ty's &s;pecial Affection to the Duke, in&s;pir'd his Soul with vigorous Principles; and his natural Courage join'd to them, prompted him to great Actions, nothing is more certain, than that this Virtue had its early Re|ward, in the Di&s;tinction with which His Maje&s;ty treated the Duke upon all Occa&s;ions; the Favour he &s;hew'd him, and that particular Affection which the King &s;hew'd to him in &s;everal re|markable Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I know it has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that the King, who all Men know was a politick Prince, and found out the In&s;ide
<PB N="31" REF="30">
of Men as &s;oon as any Prince in the World could do, did not &s;hew his Grace &s;o much Favour &s;ingly upon his own Account; but that finding but few of the Nobility, at that Time, enclin'd to a Military Life; and being very de&s;irous, by any Means, to invite and encourage them to come into the Field, he put the Duke in &s;uch a Po&s;ture and Figure in his Camp, as was enough to move any Man of Honour to love the War for his &s;ake; wherein the King &s;eem'd, as they &s;aid, to treat the Duke as if he had been the Repre&s;entative of the Nobility; and that they might &s;ee with what Di&s;tinction an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> would be u&s;ed in the Army; for, &s;aid they, the King was not &s;o ill read in Men, as not to know that there were many, who might lay as great a Claim to his Favour, on Account of Merit, as the Duke.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t Year therefore of the War, the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Fame con&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e Favours which the King did him, and the Honours which he receiv'd from Foreigners on that Account; for whom the King honour'd, it was no Wonder at all to &s;ee honour'd by others.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">The Duke was but a young Man when he went into the Army, which was in the Year 1690, when he went over to <HI>Ireland</HI>: And we read of him at the Battle of the <HI>Boyn</HI>; but all we have of him in that Action terminates in this, that the Day after the Battle he was &s;ent with &s;ome Troops to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dublin</HI>; and though this was, as is noted, but to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for the Citizens of <HI>Dublin</HI> had already taken Arms, and turn'd out the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and &s;ent to the King to receive them into his Protection; yet was Mon&s;ieur <HI>Overkirk</HI> &s;ent with the Troops; &s;o that the Duke had no Command, but was &s;ent with them, as being a Per&s;on by Name honour'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his Family, and for the great E&s;tate which he po&s;&s;e&s;t in that Kingdom; &s;o that hitherto the Duke'<HI>s</HI> Hi&s;tory began principally on the Fame of his Birth, and no Merit of his own, other than that he was a brisk, promi&s;ing, young Gentleman; and having the Advan|tage of &s;uch a Tutor as the King, gave Hopes that, in Time, if his Under|&s;tanding prov'd equal to his Courage, he would be a very great Man; in the mean Time, he was made one of
<PB N="33" REF="32">
the Privy Council in <HI>Ireland,</HI> an Honour every one knows, was the Con&s;equence of his Birth, and of the Rank which he bore among the Nobility of that Kingdom; in which, if my Memory fails me not, there was not any Man of the Rank of a Duke but him&s;elf, at lea&s;t who embrac'd King <HI>William</HI>'s Party.</P>
<P>The next Time we hear of his Grace, was in <HI>Holland</HI>; for we do not find any thing of him in the Campaign of <HI>Limerick,</HI> or that he quitted the Court to go any more into the Field. But the King having appointed the next Year that famous Congre&s;s of Princes at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the like of which the World has not &s;een for many Ages, his Grace, and the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> were the only two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dukes, who appear'd at Court on that Occa&s;ion; in which all that we read of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>; amounts to this: 1. That he made the greate&s;t Show of any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, and even beyond &s;ome Sovereign Prin|ces that appear'd there. 2. That at the great Fea&s;t which the King made, <HI>Au Mai&s;on du Bois,</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Grace had a Cu&s;hion given him, and
<PB N="34" REF="33">
&s;at at Table with the King, next to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and on the King's Right Hand; and that the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> drank to his Grace, and not to any other of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Noblemen.</P>
<P>The&s;e were his Grace's fir&s;t Cam|paigns for the&s;e Honours, and &s;uch like, may well be &s;aid to take up the fir&s;t three Year of his Grace's being a|broad with the King: But the War coming on apace, and the Service be|ing like to be very warm; he that was thus honoured to be near the King at his Table, could not expect but in the Field, where, it was well known, His Maje&s;ty never &s;par'd him|&s;elf, he mu&s;t be equally expos'd; and that nothing but the utmo&s;t Gallantry, and Love of Action, could recommend him to his Maje&s;ty; and as the Gal|lantry of the Duke had not yet been try'd, but promis'd fair, his Grace prepar'd him&s;elf for the Field, with a Re&s;olution to venture his Life with the King, in the Quality of &s;uch an Officer, as Time, and the Favour of his Prince, &s;hould offer him.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
The King, who was a known En|courager, as well as Rewarder, of generous and gallant Spirits, &s;oon found the Duke was Ma&s;ter of as much per&s;onal Gallantry, as was requi&s;ite for a General Officer; and rather &s;trove, upon all Occa&s;ions, to add a due Proportion of Phlegm to the great Quantity of Fire, that Na|ture, and his high Birth, had given this young Duke; that &s;o he might, by weighing and by re&s;training his Forwardne&s;s, bring him to act with Temper, as well as Feat; and pro|cure him that nece&s;&s;ary Qualification of a General, <HI>viz.</HI> a cool Head to a warm Heart; how far his Maje&s;ty went in this Part, and with what Suc|ce&s;s, Time has &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Appearance, however, that his late Grace made in the Army, was very particular; that is, for its extraordinary Magnificence; his Grace affecting to make his Quarters the general Rendezvous of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers; where he kept a Table like a Prince, fea&s;ted all that came to him, and liv'd at an Expence &s;uperior, not on|ly to all the other Generals, but even to the King him&s;elf: His Maje&s;ty, though
<PB N="36" REF="35">
he never affected that Part him&s;elf, nor did at that Time much approve of it, as what tended rather to effe|minate his Men, than to qualify them for the Fatigues of the Campaign; yet was plea&s;ed to indulge this popu|lar Humour in the Duke, and to make him a particular Allowance to &s;upport the Charge; what the Effects of that Allowance was, every one, who was pre&s;ent on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, knows, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Duke was &s;o far from letting that Allowance be an A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Relief to his private For|tunes, that it only &s;erv'd to encrea&s;e the luxuriant Expence; and he fail'd not to run out with &s;uch a boundle&s;s Profu&s;ion, as con&s;um'd all his Maje|&s;ty's Allowance, and all that his own E&s;tate could &s;upply al&s;o; and not on|ly that, but to contract immen&s;o Debts; &s;uch as, it may be fear'd, the Creditors would gladly know now how to have &s;ecur'd to them.</P>
<P>It cannot be forgotten, that &s;ome People took &s;o much Offence at this Exce&s;s, as to &s;peak to the King of it more than once; and even to &s;ugge&s;t, that it &s;eem'd &s;o much to affect Po|pularity in the Army, that it might
<PB N="37" REF="36">
be of dangerous Con&s;equence in the End; but that his Maje&s;ty was al|ways plea&s;ed to put it by, and to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf in Favour of the Duke's Hone&s;ty, more than in Favour of his Under&s;tanding; intimating, that he was a Man <HI>without De&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P>This, however, is noted for the Rea|der's ob&s;ervation, and whereby he may &s;ee, that the Popularity of this great Man &s;eems to have its Ri&s;e and Begin|ning, rather in the Profu&s;ion of his Ex|pences, his Contempt of Money, and an unwary Extravagance, than in the Glory and Merit of his Actions; and if &s;uch a mon&s;trous Extravagance can entitle a Per&s;on to the Affection, &s;o as to &s;et him above the National Ju&s;tice, then is the Reward of Vice greater than the Reward of Virtue.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the Way of living above, naturally brought to the Duke a Multitude of Hangers on; and, by Con&s;equence, ju&s;t &s;o many Flat|terers, who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to trumpet Prai&s;es and ful&s;ome Things of their Benefactor, and were requited again with the Bounty and Benefi|cence of the General on all Occa&s;ions;
<PB N="38" REF="37">
and what Wonder if this Behaviour, in an Army full of needy Per&s;ons, and Men of Fortune; and that by this, and a general Affability and Conde|&s;cending, even to a Familiarity, to the Soldiery, he became exceedingly be|loved by the Army.</P>
<P>It is not for this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e to enter into an Enquiry, how far a true Fame can be rai&s;ed upon Acti|ons really not ju&s;tifiable in them&s;elves; and whether a Per&s;on, being to an Ex|ce&s;s profu&s;e, as well of his own, as of other Mens, &s;hall be e&s;teemed an inimitable Virtue. I remember it was objected by &s;ome &s;atyrical People in this City, again&s;t a Reverend Prelate of our Church, that his Charity was carry'd up to &s;uch a Height, that it became criminal; and that he would borrow Money, though he knew him|&s;elf unable to repay it; and that, when borrow'd, he would give it a|way to relieve the Poor Clergy; and this the cen&s;orious Part of the World reproach'd him with, calling it, <HI>Rob|bery for Burnt Offering.</HI> But much more would this have been criminal, had it been borrow'd to keep a pro|fu&s;e Table, and to &s;pend in luxurious
<PB N="39" REF="38">
Treats: What offers in his Favour is, that it was the meer Effect of the ge|nerous Bounty of his Temper, with|out any De&s;ign of evil to any one; and that though he impair'd his E|&s;tate by it; yet his Grace was always ready to yield to rea&s;onable Retrench|ments at Home; and even to alienate his E&s;tate for the Satisfaction of his ju&s;t Debts; and that he has te&s;tify'd this by particular Examples more than once.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould be granted, it will go far indeed to recommend the ge|nerous Spirit of the Duke, in doing ju&s;t things at la&s;t; but it will be hard, even for the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> it &s;elf, to convince the World, that &s;uch a thoughtle&s;s Bounty, which &s;hould reduce a Man of &s;uch a Figure, not only to expend the greate&s;t Allowance any King of <HI>England</HI> ever made to a General; but to a Nece&s;&s;ity of alienat|ing his Inheritance, and beggering his Po&s;terity; I &s;ay, that &s;uch a thought|le&s;s Bounty &s;hould entitle a Man to a popular Reputation, and erect him in the Thoughts of the People, as a Per&s;on qualify'd to be cry'd up, even again&s;t the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
But, perhaps, this is not all; for who indeed can think it &s;hould? Let us look farther into his Hi&s;tory, and the next thing we hear of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> is, that when the great Battle of <HI>Landen</HI> was fought, the Duke, who commanded the Troops of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;hold, and was, by this Time, a Lieutenant-General, was taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>French,</HI> and carry'd to <HI>Namure</HI>; where, to his great good Fortune, he was immediately ex|changed for the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> who was taken by the King's Army; af|ter which he &s;erv'd with a due Ap|plau&s;e; for all will allow him to be per&s;onally brave, and to be able to act under another General with as much Vigor as can be de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the late Queen come to the Crown, and the War renew|ed again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> with this Ad|dition, that <HI>Spain</HI> was now again&s;t us, as it had been before for us: But Her Maje&s;ty having re&s;olv'd upon an Expedition again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> where Hopes were given, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would, by the Help of the <HI>Almirante de Ca|&s;tile,</HI> declare again&s;t King <HI>Philip,</HI> on Sight of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet and Army:

But Her Maje&s;ty had made choice of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to command in that Expedition.</P>
<P>How his Grace brought the Army to the Bay of <HI>Cadiz</HI>; landed at Port St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s; and how, for want of his Grace's being a le&s;s good-natur'd Man, and more a General, that rich Town was entirely &s;ack'd and plunder'd; and the innocent <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants Hou&s;es mi&s;erably plundered of an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure, contrary to the QUEEN's De&s;ign; and indeed by a ba&s;e Violence of in|ferior Generals, pre&s;uming on the Ea|&s;ine&s;s and good Temper of their Gene|ral: This is well known to mo&s;t Men, as well as it is, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;o far from being brought to favour the De&s;ign of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> after that, as was expected, that they for ever after hat|ed us; and omitted no Occa&s;ion of &s;hewing the mo&s;t implacable Aver&s;ion to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and even to King <HI>Charles</HI> III. for our &s;akes, as was po&s;&s;ible; and which never abated till the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> where they paid us Home for it; neither did it abate then in&s;o|much that it was thought fit afterwards to act in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> rather with <HI>Ger|mans,</HI>

<P>It is true, Fortune remembred the Duke in the &s;ame Voyage, and kindly made him a Pre&s;ent of the <HI>Vigo</HI> Fleet; with the Conque&s;t of which, coming fre&s;h grown with Laurels, the People, who thought he had brought much more Money than he did, &s;houted him through the Streets, with infinite Acclamations; and indeed had his Grace had more Soldiers, and fewer Thieves in his Army, that had been a happy Voyage for <HI>England,</HI> equal to that of Sir <HI>Francis Drake:</HI> But alas! never was &s;o much lo&s;t, and &s;o little got, as by that Voyage; the great Di&s;a&s;ter whereof is, by &s;ome, &s;aid to be owing to the ea&s;y Temper of the General, who having no Value for Money him&s;elf, &s;eem'd al|mo&s;t entirely to forget, of what U&s;e it was to his Country; or that there were &s;ome at Home, who knew how to em|ploy it, though, perhaps, he did not.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42">
From this Time his late Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> ap|pear'd very little in the Field, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> en|joy'd the full Benefits of Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the mid&s;t of a bloody War, having the Pro|fits heap'd upon him of many advan|tageous Po&s;ts; &s;uch as that of the fir&s;t Troop of Hor&s;e-Guards, Lord Lieu|tenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the like; all which, his natural Profu&s;ion remaining to him, have been &s;o ill able to &s;upply him, that, added to his own E&s;tate, they have been far from pre&s;erving him from an immen&s;e Debt; which, it is believ'd, exceeds all that any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobleman has contracted within the Memory of Man, the old Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>It is not my De&s;ign to load the Per|&s;on of the late Duke with Reflections, at a Time when he is already under the Re&s;entment of the Parliament and People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> fled his Country, and attainted of Trea&s;on; and for this Rea&s;on, I forbear to enter into any Part of his Hi&s;tory, during his late general Command of the Army under the Queen; nor is it needful, the Applica|tion of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e turning upon another Point, and rather re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="44" REF="43">
the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>; and the Que&s;tion which occurs from all that has been &s;aid, is properly directed to them, to enquire what there has been in all the Hi&s;tory of this late Noble Per&s;on, that entitles him to the Affection of the common People, or that &s;hould make him be beloved; much le&s;s that &s;hould &s;et him up to be the Idol of the Mob, and to have his Health drunk in a Sort of Oppo&s;ition to the King's, as the weak and unthinking People have been taught to do.</P>
<P>And it is very well worth Ob&s;ervati|on, that if you ask one of the be&s;t in|formed among the common People; What it is they admire the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> for? What are his Virtues? what have been the Particulars of his Life? They have little to &s;ay; nothing but that he is a good natur'd, generous, free-hearted Man; &s;o that, in a few Words, to &s;pend a Man's E&s;tate, with|out Foreca&s;t, without Bounds, and in a Manner which no prudent Man can do, is the true Way to be admir'd, and the mo&s;t egregious Folly the Foundation of Popularity.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">
But is it a Virtue to &s;quander away immen&s;e Sums of Money? Is &s;pending a great E&s;tate a valuable thing, and fit to recommend a Man to the E&s;teem of the People of <HI>England?</HI> Why then none but Beggars mu&s;t be the Peoples Favourites; and to have a great Multitude of Creditors, is to become truly popular. I cannot &s;ee upon what Foundation &s;uch Men can claim the Favour of the People; but what the Inhabitants of the <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Mint</HI> have as good a Title to, in their Proportion; and it is a mo&s;t unan&s;wer|able Reflexion upon the Judgment of our People, and the Methods they take to place their particular Favours, that they are guided by tho&s;e Accompli&s;h|ments in the Per&s;ons admired, which only tend to Vice and Degeneracy; and that they are be&s;t plea&s;ed with that which ought to de&s;troy, not attract their Affection. It is true, that ge|nerous Principles, and a bountiful, open Hand, ju&s;tly recommends a noble Per&s;on to our good Opinion; e&s;pecially when &s;elfi&s;h, narrow Principles are grown &s;o general in the World; but, in my O|pinion, a Man cea&s;es to be generous, that is open to Profu&s;ion; and he that
<PB N="46" REF="45">
can &s;et no Bounds to his Bounty, in|&s;tead of being a wi&s;e Man, may rather be &s;aid to &s;quander away his Money like a Fool; a Man of Honour ought to know the Value of what he be&s;tows, and of what he expends; otherwi&s;e he becomes bountiful to a Vice, and throws away his Money, not for want of Avarice, but for want of Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And for what can this be &s;aid to re|commend him; unle&s;s he &s;hall be &s;aid to become popular, meerly on the &s;ame Account that the People fall into Rabbles and Tumults; not becau&s;e they are wi&s;e, but becau&s;e they are mad.</P>
<P>It is Time for the People of <HI>En|gland</HI> then to con&s;ider the particular Ca&s;e; and if they will not remove their Acclamations, and Cry of Tu|mult, from the Per&s;on of the Duke; yet, for their own Reputation, let them remove it from his Vice, and find out &s;ome of his Virtues to fix it upon; for certainly a meer making Ducks and Drakes of his Money, can|not recommend him; or if it does, it
<PB N="47" REF="46">
mu&s;t be only to tho&s;e, who can give no Rea&s;on for what they do.</P>
<P>It has been alledged by &s;ome, that this Popularity of the Duke's has ri&s;en from the Accident of Circum&s;tances; and that it has not been at all of the Duke's &s;eeking or de&s;iring, or from any greater E&s;teem than was before &s;hewn him; but becau&s;e the Party, who have, of late, &s;hewn them&s;elves Oppo&s;ers of the Government, and of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> had no Body el&s;e to name to the Mobb, who they dur&s;t mention in publick.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould be true, the Duke has very little Obligation to tho&s;e People; and, moreover, it is the &s;evere&s;t Satyr upon the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, that it could be po&s;&s;ible to mention; being a clear Te&s;timony, that their <HI>Pre|tender</HI> has no Share in the Affections of the People; and that they could hope for no Favour among the Com|mons, if they did &s;o much as name him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, That, fir&s;t, as the Duke has no peculiar Ac|compli&s;hments of his own, which can be &s;aid to recommend him to the
<PB N="48" REF="47">
Mobb; &s;o all that has been done to render him popular, has been done not only without any per&s;onal Merit of his own; but, which is wor&s;e, from a private Piece of Policy, making him a Cover to their <HI>Jacobite</HI> De&s;ign, and no better than a meer Tool for the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
