<HEAD>A Declaration of TRUTH
TO
<HI>Benjamin Hoadly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BE it known unto thee, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that albeit we, who are the People of
the Lord, own thee not in thy proud
Titles, neither in thy Office, as thou exerci|&s;e&s;t
the &s;ame; neither can we treat thee with
that Di&s;tinction wherewith Men di&s;tingui&s;h
thee, fora&s;much as we do not acknowledge
the &s;ame (as thou do&s;t) to be of God: Ne|verthele&s;s
I &s;hall treat thee re&s;pectfully in
this thing, whereof I am now to commune
with thee, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t uttered much
Truth with thy Mouth, and therefore ha&s;t
moved much Wrath of wicked Men again&s;t
thee.</P>
<P>And would'&s;t thou, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> faithfully
pur&s;ue the Light which I perceive is in thee,
and which &s;hineth abroad far and nigh; I
&s;ay, would'&s;t thou act according to the Light
which I plainly &s;ee is in thee, thou &s;hould'&s;t
have Prai&s;e; for thou ha&s;t verily <HI>done wor|thily,</HI>
in that thou ha&s;t re&s;tored the King|dom
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to them to whom it &s;olely appertaineth,
and ha&s;t dethroned the U&s;urpations of wic|ked
Men, who have unrighteou&s;ly &s;et them|&s;elves
up in the Throne of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou ha&s;t done worthi|ly,
in that thou ha&s;t appeared for the Cau&s;e
of our God again&s;t the Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of
Men; and ha&s;t not been afraid, neither di&s;|couraged,
when they have ri&s;en up again&s;t
thee with great Wrath: And I am &s;ent unto
thee to declare in words of Seriou&s;ne&s;s, that
thou &s;hould'&s;t not faint, neither be di&s;may'd,
for that many of the Faithful Servants of
God are with thee in this thing, and do &s;ay
unto thee <HI>God &s;peed,</HI> which thou knowe&s;t
we are forbidden to &s;ay unto the ungodly,
and unto Men who are not led in the right
way.</P>
<P>Having thus given my Te&s;timony to thy
good Works, I communicated my Intentions
to Friends: Among the&s;e, <HI>Aminadab,</HI> a
righteous Man, fearing not the Face of Men,
but fearing God only, <HI>&s;aith unto thee,</HI> that
his Heart is likewi&s;e with thee in the things
which thou ha&s;t &s;aid; <HI>to wit,</HI> That the Power
of Men, or the Laws of Men, have no Au|thority
to interfere with, or to join their
Power with the Right Hand of Je&s;us, who
allows no Partners in the Throne of his
Glorious Kingdom on Earth, any more than
he will admit Partners in the Throne of his
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Glori&s;y'd Kingdom in Heaven. Moreover,
he hath &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers unto me, &s;aying,
Speak thou <HI>Ebenezer</HI> in the Ears of <HI>Benjamin
Hoadly,</HI> and &s;ay unto him, Fear not the Face
of Men, tho' many ri&s;e up again&s;t thee, &s;ay|ing,
Thou lye&s;t, thou lye&s;t; for verily thou
lye&s;t not <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but ha&s;t &s;poken the
Truth, and it &s;hall prevail.</P>
<P><HI>Aaron,</HI> a Man filled with Knowledge, and
a Teacher of Wi&s;dom, &s;ent al&s;o unto me,
&s;aying, <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> the thing which <HI>Aminadab</HI>
our Friend hath communicated unto thee
concerning <HI>Benjamin Hoadly,</HI> are things
which &s;avour of Truth; and thou wilt do
well to &s;peak unto the &s;aid <HI>Benjamin,</HI> &s;ay|ing,
Fear not <HI>Benjamin,</HI> for wi&s;e Men are
with thee, and good Men are with thee; and
verily they be better Men, and more in num|ber,
that are with thee than tho&s;e that be
again&s;t thee.</P>
<P>I might name unto thee many Friends, en|dowed
with Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, who
&s;peak well of thee, for that thou ha&s;t &s;poken
the Truth with great boldne&s;s, and ha&s;t not
feared to utter it, even in the hearing of the
King, and we may not doubt but that our
Lord the King will be thy &s;trong Helper a|gain&s;t
all thine Enemies, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t thee
to &s;ilence the Gain-&s;ayers of thy Doctrine;
for verily, the King is an unfeigned Friend
unto the Truth, and would be willing that
<PB N="6" REF="5">
all Men &s;hould walk in the path to Heaven,
howbeit he may not be inlightned equal to
our Friends, which neverthele&s;s we hope he
may hereafter be, if God &s;eeth it good to
bring his Heart over unto us.</P>
<P>And albeit Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou art not
yet joined unto the faithful Servants of God
our Friends, but that thou for a little while
remaine&s;t, as to &s;ome things, in the Darkne&s;s
of the World; yet fora&s;much as thou join|e&s;t
with us in the Truth, we embrace thee
willingly, nothing doubting but that the
Heavenly Light which has &s;hone out in thy
Word, will hereafter &s;hine in thy Heart,
and thou wilt come over more perfectly un|to
us Friends, who are already e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the Truth.</P>
<P>And I am the farther confirm'd in the truth
hereof, in that thou ha&s;t &s;o boldly acknow|ledged
the Truths of God, being the &s;ame
profe&s;&s;ed by us, and for the &s;ake whereof
we are inclin'd to think well of thee; and
&s;eeing I have informed thee that thou ha&s;t
&s;o exactly taught what we in Principle be|lieve,
and clo&s;ely adhere to in Practice, I
&s;hall let thee know, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> how exactly
thou agree&s;t with us who have received the
Truth, and that we hold and believe all the
Truths that thou ha&s;t taught, and that al&s;o
even in the &s;ame words in which thou ha&s;t
declared them, or but with &s;mall variation
<PB N="7" REF="6">
thereof, as thou wilt farther be informed,
when thou &s;halt read the following Heads,
which are part of <HI>the Principles of Truth,
or of tho&s;e things about Doctrine, which we
Friends do mo&s;t &s;urely believe and recieve;</HI> to
wit,</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P><HI>Concerning Religion, we believe, that it is
only the Spirit of the Lord that makes Men
truly Religious; and no Man ought to be com|pelled
to or from any exerci&s;e or practice in Re|ligion,
by any outward Law or Power, but every
Man ought to be left free, as the Lord &s;hall
per&s;wade his own mind, in doing, or leaving un|done
this or the other practice in Religion; and
every Man of what Profe&s;&s;ion in Religion &s;o|ever,
ought to be protected in Peace; provided
him&s;elf be a Man of Peace, not &s;eeking the wrong
of any Man's Per&s;on or E&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That to reprove fal&s;e Opini|ons
and un&s;ound Doctrines and Principles &s;eek|ing
to convince them that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, by
Exhortation or &s;harp Reproof, by word or wri|ting,
ought not to be counted a breach of the
Peace; or to &s;trive about the things of the King|dom
of God, by Men of contrary Minds or Judg|ments,
this ought not to be puni&s;hed by the Ma|gi&s;trates
and their Laws: for we believe that
the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are
only to pre&s;erve Mens Per&s;ons and E&s;tates, and
not to pre&s;erve Men in Opinions: neither ought
the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon Mens</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Con&s;ciences, to bind them to or from &s;uch a
Judgment or Practice in Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That Chri&s;t is, and ought only
to be Lord and Exerci&s;er of Mens Con&s;ciences,
and his Spirit mu&s;t only lead into all Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That Obedience and Subje|tion
in the Lord belongs to Superiors, and that
Subjects ought to obey them [in the Lord] that
have rule over them: and that Children ought
to obey their Parents, and Wives their Hus|bands,
and Servants their Ma&s;ters in all things,
which is according to God, which &s;tand in the
exerci&s;e of a pure Con&s;cience towards God: But
where Rulers, Parents or Ma&s;ters, or any other,
command or require Subjection in any thing
which is contrary to God, or not according to
him, in &s;uch ca&s;es all People are free, and ought
to obey God rather than Man; and we believe,
that herein God will ju&s;tifie them, being guided
and led by his Spirit in all that which is good,
and out of all that which is evil.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Herein, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou maye&s;t &s;ee,
as in a Vi&s;ion of clear Light, that thou art
in the &s;ame way of Truth with us, and I
have Freedom to own thee therein; for ve|rily
thou ha&s;t clearly te&s;tified unto <HI>the Truth
which we believe,</HI> in that thou ha&s;t likewi&s;e
&s;aid, even in our Words, <HI>That every Man
ought to be left free as the Lord &s;hall per&s;wade
his own Mind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
Now <HI>Benjamin</HI> let it not &s;eem &s;trange un|to
thee, that I &s;ay unto thee, that the&s;e are
our own Words; for I &s;peak therein with
Truth and Soberne&s;s, referring thee for
Te&s;timony thereof unto a little Book pub|li&s;hed
more than Forty and Five Years &s;ince,
by a Body of our Friends, and Signed by
<HI>John Crook,</HI> a Man endowed with a Spirit of
a &s;ound Mind, and al&s;o by three other Anci|ents,
who were likewi&s;e Men of true Wi&s;dom.
This Book is Entituled, <HI>Truth's Principles,</HI>
&amp;c. in which Book the Words which I have
written unto thee above, are to be found.</P>
<P>Searching likewi&s;e thy Book, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
which thou ha&s;t made Publick, by the Com|mand
of the King, I find the&s;e Words, which
I hope thou ha&s;t learned from our Friends
above written; to wit, That the Language
of the Word is, <HI>That knowing the Terrors of
the Lord, we</HI> &s;hould <HI>per&s;wade Men;</HI> but that
the Language of the Mens Conduct, who
profe&s;s to &s;ucceed Him that Taught the o|ther,
is, That having the Terrors of this
World in their power, they do not per&s;wade
Men, but <HI>force their outward Profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t
their inward Per&s;wa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Verily thou ha&s;t &s;poken, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as one
having the Light of the Spirit; and this is a
Truth which the Men of the World cannot
be able to re&s;i&s;t. Verily, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
we agree with thee, that the Kingdom of
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Je&s;us is not of this World, and that the
Laws of his Kingdom likewi&s;e, and the Re|wards
and Puni&s;hments of tho&s;e Laws, are
&s;uited to the end of tho&s;e Laws, and to the
Nature of his Kingdom: Nay, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I will
u&s;e thy Words as thou ha&s;t u&s;ed the Words
of wi&s;e Men, who went before thee; to wit,
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Laws</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> therefore, as
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> left them, have nothing of <HI>this</HI>
World in their view; not Tendency, either
to the Exaltation of <HI>Some,</HI> in wordly
Pomp and Dignity; or to their ab&s;olute
Dominion over the Faith and Religious
conduct of <HI>Others</HI> of his Subjects; or to
the erecting of any &s;ort of <HI>Temporal King|dom,</HI>
under the Covert of Name of a <HI>Spi|ritual</HI>
One."<P>"The <HI>Sanctions</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Law</HI> are <HI>Re|wards</HI>
and <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI> But of what
&s;ort? Not the Rewards of this Worlds;
not the Offices, or Glories, of this State;
not the Pains of <HI>Pri&s;ons, Bani&s;hments,
Fines,</HI> or any le&s;&s;er and more <HI>moderate Pe|nalties;</HI>
nay, not the much le&s;&s;er <HI>Negative
Di&s;couragements</HI> that belong to <HI>Humane
Society. He</HI> was far from thinking that
<HI>The&s;e</HI> could be the In&s;truments of &s;uch a
<HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion,</HI> as He thought acceptable to
God. But, as the Great End of his
<HI>Kingdom,</HI> was to guide Men to Happine&s;s,
after the &s;hort Images of it were over
<PB N="11" REF="10">
here below; &s;o, he took his <HI>Motives</HI>
from that place where his <HI>Kingdom</HI> fir&s;t
began, and where it was at la&s;t to end;
from tho&s;e <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> in
a future State, which had no relation to
this World: And to &s;hew that his <HI>King|dom
was not of this World,</HI> all the <HI>Sanctions</HI>
which He thought fit to give to <HI>His Laws,</HI>
were <HI>not of this World</HI> at all."</P></Q></P>
<P>I confirm the&s;e thy Po&s;itions and Doc|trines,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> with my Voice, and give
thee Prai&s;e therefore, for verily thou art wor|thy
of Prai&s;e, not only that thou ha&s;t &s;poken
boldly the Truth, but for that thou ha&s;t
done it in the Face of the Adver&s;ary, and
ha&s;t not been afraid. And Ble&s;&s;ed be the
King, into who&s;e Heart God hath put it to
Frown upon the Gain&s;ayers; and albeit they
were gathered together again&s;t thee, he hath
&s;eattered them, and hath &s;ent them away di&s;|couraged.</P>
<P>Neither
do I flatter thee with my Lips;
for Friends are not Guilty of &s;uch things,
and it would be in me a great Iniquity; but
I &s;peak to thee in Sincerity and in Truth,
and my Thoughts are moved to utter the
Words of my Mouth; for verily thou ha&s;t
dethroned and pulled down that Man of Sin,
the <HI>Son of Perdition,</HI> which <HI>has Exalted him|&s;elf;</HI>
thou ha&s;t valintly Encountred the
Tribe of ungodly Prie&s;ts, who have by an
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Injurious U&s;age of the Lord's People, for
many Years u&s;urped the Authority of King
Je&s;us, and have exerci&s;ed Dominion over the
Souls who they have had committed by Men
unto their Charge; the&s;e they have Tyranni|zed
over, and have Cruelly Per&s;ecuted un|der
pretence of Authority from Je&s;us; albeit
Je&s;us the true King and only Head of all true
Believers, as thou ha&s;t well &s;aid, hath given
no &s;uch Authority unto them.</P>
<P>Now concerning Mini&s;ters I will tell thee
what Friends do &s;urely Receive and Believe,
and I will not give thee my own words, but
the words of the &s;aid Declaration of <HI>Truth's
Principles</HI> mention'd before; to wit,</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>"Such Mini&s;ters as are made by God, who
are &s;anctified by his Word and Power, who
have freely received perfect Gifts from
God, and &s;o by the Spirit and Power of
God are &s;ent forth into the World, to turn
the People from Darkne&s;s to Light, and
from the Power of Satan to the Power of
God; who freely Mini&s;ter unto others,
without coveting any Man's Gold, or Sil|ver,
or Apparel; not &s;eeking theirs, but
them: Warning every Man and teaching
every Man in all Wi&s;dom, that they might
pre&s;ent every Man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:
&s;uch as mini&s;ter from the Spirit, and have
the Word of God abiding in them; who
are never unprovided, but at all times and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
&s;ea&s;ons, and in all places, do &s;peak and
declare the Truth, as they are moved and
in&s;tructed, and as the Spirit of Truth doth
give them utterance; Such Mini&s;ters we
own, and have in great e&s;teem."</P></Q>
<P>This we &s;urely do Believe, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and
thou ha&s;t done worthily in concurring with
us, and in that thou ha&s;t taken away from
tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> all that
Power and pretended Authority which they
a&s;&s;ume, and which we &s;ay they u&s;urp contra|ry
to the Nature of the Office of a Mini&s;ter,
which we al&s;o Declare to be only to Teach
and In&s;truct, not to Terrify and Affright the
People of the Lord; and herein we know,
that altho' thou wilt offend them, and they
will &s;hew great Wrath again&s;t thee therefore;
yet, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> we know thou ha&s;t &s;poken the
Truth again&s;t them, and I concur with thee
therein; nay I acknowledge thee and own
thee therein, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t concurred
with us in the Truth, not doubting but thou
wilt be farther inlightned, in the Lord's due
time, to joyn with Friends in all the words
of Truth which we Profe&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther &s;ay in thy behalf, Friend
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> that thou ha&s;t &s;poken Excellent
words of Wi&s;dom in defiance of the Men of
high Notions, who are of the Tribe who thou
did&s;t belong to in former time; for thou ha&s;t
taken the People out of their hands, and ha&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;et them free from the mock Terrors of Vain
Men, &s;uch as they call the Artillery of the
Church; which we that know the ways of
Truth, are acquainted with the Deceitfulne&s;s
of; and as I Glory in thy Words thereupon,
I &s;hall repeat them in thy Prai&s;e as followeth,
to wit,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not the lea&s;t Tittle of Salvation or
Damnation depends upon the Will of weak
Men, but all upon God and your &s;elves;
Humane Benedictions, Humane Ab&s;oluti|ons,
Humane Denunciations, Humane Ex|communications,
have nothing to do with
the Favour or Anger of God: But are Hu|mane
Engins, permitted to work (<HI>like o|ther
Evils</HI>) by Providence."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are Excellent Things &s;poken with
Wi&s;dom, and thou &s;halt have due Prai&s;e of
the &s;ame: Likewi&s;e ha&s;t thou Batter'd down
the &s;trong Holds of Satan, in thy Words on
the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In all your <HI>Religious Concerns,</HI> that ef|fect
your Eternal Salvation, and your <HI>Title</HI>
to <HI>God's Favour,</HI> your <HI>Rule</HI> is plain and

your &s;ole Judge, as to tho&s;e Points. The

Non jurors</HI>: The <HI>Non-jurors</HI> may <HI>Excom|municate
the High-Church-Men,</HI> as well as
all other <HI>Briti&s;h Prote&s;tants,</HI> who pray for
King <HI>GEORGE</HI>: The&s;e again may
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>Excommunicate, &V;nchurch, &V;nchri&s;tian,</HI>
tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Church-Government,</HI> or <HI>Wor|&s;hip,</HI>

may Exerci&s;e the &s;ame <HI>Spiritual Di&s;|cipline,</HI>
wherever their <HI>Terrors</HI> can extend
them&s;elves: They may thus &s;catter <HI>Dam|nation</HI>
about; Playing, one would think,
as the <HI>Man</HI> in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> with <HI>Fire|brands</HI>
and <HI>Death,</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>Are we
not in Sport;</HI> and they may every one
Flatter <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> that this <HI>Power of the
Keys</HI> &s;huts out from the <HI>Catholick Church</HI>
here, and from the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI>
hereafter: But it is in truth only from
<HI>them&s;elves</HI> that they can <HI>Excommunicate</HI>:
And this is very often their own <HI>Crime,</HI>
and their own <HI>Lo&s;s:</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf and
his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> have plainly told you <HI>what</HI> it
is, and <HI>what</HI> alone that &s;hall cut you off
from <HI>him;</HI> and Declared a Cur&s;e upon <HI>all</HI>
who <HI>Preach any other Go&s;pel;</HI> and con&s;e|quently,
who add any thing as ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to his Favour, which he hath not
made &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e Truths of thine, &s;uch I call them,
as thou ha&s;t been honoured to &s;peak them
fir&s;t among Men, I bear my Te&s;timony, and
the good People, the People of the Lord,
de&s;pi&s;ed by Men, of whom I am the
meane&s;t, have born their Te&s;timony many
Years ago: I &s;ay, with thee, that the boa&s;t|ed
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Terms which tho&s;e Men make wicked u&s;e
of, &s;uch as <HI>Regular</HI> and <HI>uninterrupted Succe&s;|&s;ions,
Authoritative Benedictions, Excommu|nications,
Ab&s;olutions,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>Vain Words,</HI>
mere <HI>Terrors of Men,</HI> not the Terrors of the
Lord, <HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles:</HI> And therefore it
is that we di&s;own the whole Tenor and Sub|&s;tance
of the Canons and In&s;titutions of that
which they Prophanely, as I doubt not thou
wilt in time be led by the&s;e Lights to do al|&s;o;
I De&s;pi&s;e and Contemn all the pretend|ed
Authority of that which they weakly and
impertinently call, a Power derived from
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles:</HI> I know no Mini&s;ters
but &s;uch as is before de&s;cribed; as for <HI>&s;uch as
are brought up at Schools and Colleges, and &s;o
made Mini&s;ters by the will of Man, who have
not freely received perfect Gifts from God for
perfecting of the Saints, but denies</HI> Perfection,
<HI>and &s;o denies the Mini&s;ters Work, neither do
mini&s;ter freely, but &s;eek for Gain from their
Quarters, and will not Preach without a price;
who are not &s;anctified by the Word of God, but
plead for a continuance in Sin while People
walk upon the Earth: Such as Mini&s;ter from
the Letter, and not from the Spirit; who can|not
Preach except they have time to Study, and
&s;o by their indu&s;try provide them&s;elves, and are
not provided of the Lord (&s;uch a Ministry is
of Works, and not the Free Gift from God)
&s;uch cannot profit People, but lead them captive</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>in an empty and dead Form,</HI> always hearing,
but never able to come to the true Know|ledge
of God: <HI>Such called Mini&s;ters we do
deny, and turn from them, and te&s;tifie again&s;t
them, as the holy men of God formerly did.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but thy
Words tend to bring thee to the &s;ame Ju&s;t
Contempt, that I have entertained, and that
Friends mo&s;t righteou&s;ly do entertain of the&s;e
<HI>uncalled</HI> Prie&s;ts, and that in the mean time
thou wilt, by thy <HI>&s;ober</HI> and weighty Speeches,
bring all that wicked Hierarchy, which tho&s;e
Prie&s;ts &s;o violently contend for, into Con|tempt
among the People.</P>
<P>I am therefore moved to bear my Te&s;ti|mony
with thee again&s;t them; fora&s;much as
they u&s;urping high Dignity and Authority,
have erected a Kingdom which they &s;ay is
the Kingdom of Je&s;us; howbeit, as I veri|ly
think, it is a Kingdom of this World,
fora&s;much as they exerci&s;e Juri&s;dictions which
be of this World therein, and have taken to
them&s;elves Powers which be of them&s;elves;
which neverthele&s;s they take upon them to
&s;ay, are de&s;cended to them, and by the no|tions
and pretences of a Succe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
Powers, they a&s;&s;ume a Right to Exerci&s;e
tho&s;e Powers over the Con&s;ciences of Men,
which Friends &s;ay they have no Right to
do: And furthermore we &s;ay and believe,
That whereas they Exerci&s;e the Power and
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Authority which alone belongs to King
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the King and &s;ole Chief of his faithful
Followers; they therefore erect their own
Kingdom, not the Kingdom of King <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
and exerci&s;e the Authority and Power, which
is his only, as their own.</P>
<P>I rejoice, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that thou ha&s;t publi&s;h|ed
true Doctrine, and ha&s;t given thy te&s;ti|mony
with us to the Truth, which we on &s;o
good and &s;olid Foundations have receiv'd;
and I que&s;tion not but thou wilt be a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by the Spirit of Truth to pull down and
overthrow the whole Power; Hierarchy and
Con&s;titution of that People who call them|&s;elves
<HI>The Church;</HI> verily, they are U&s;urpers
of the Kingdom and Throne of King <HI>Je&s;us;</HI>
and thou &s;halt be a Champion of the Truth,
in that thou &s;halt overthrow tho&s;e Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick
<HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> which are
not of God, and &s;halt e&s;tabli&s;h true Religion
in that mighty Principle of Heavenly Light,
in which it is only to be found.</P>
<P>This is that inward Revelation which
thou ha&s;t been obliged to bear thy Te&s;timo|ny
unto, (<HI>viz</HI>) That Light <HI>which per&s;wades</HI>
the Minds of Men, and whereby every &s;tep
of Reformation which hath been made in
the World, hath been ju&s;tified, and which,
as thou &s;aye&s;t well, is all the Account which
Prote&s;tants can give for their being reform'd
from the People call'd <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
And doubtle&s;s thou ha&s;t by the &s;ame Ar|guments
ju&s;tified all tho&s;e, the People of
the Lord, who <HI>being per&s;waded</HI> in them&s;elves
of their being guided by Heavenly Light,
have &s;eparated and withdrawn from the&s;e
U&s;urpations, of which thou ha&s;t &s;poken &s;o
worthily.</P>
<P>And what remains, beloved Friend <HI>Ben|jamin,</HI>
but that thou &s;hould&s;t, according as
thou ha&s;t worthily begun, and according to
the Light which &s;hineth in thy Mind, <HI>&s;epa|rate
thy &s;elf from</HI> the&s;e U&s;urpers of unrigh|teous
Authority, and joining thy &s;elf with
<HI>the Friends</HI> to Truth, &s;hould&s;t bear thy Te|&s;timony
again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s; for verily
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou can&s;t not but &s;ee and abhor
the Doctrine which the&s;e Men teach, &s;aying,
We are the Church, and Power is with us;
which thou knowe&s;t is fal&s;e, and is not of
God, and that the Power which they u&s;e is
not of God, but is the Power of Men, tend|ing
to ungodly Dominion and U&s;urpation;
&s;uch as is that of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> which
neverthele&s;s they have di&s;owned while they
yet practice.</P>
<P>For verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> it &s;eemeth to me
that thou who ha&s;t received &s;uch Light, and
ha&s;t acknowledged the Truths which are di|rectly
contrary to the&s;e Men, can&s;t not any
longer continue among them, or wear tho&s;e
prophane En&s;igns of Idolatry, whereby thou
<PB N="20" REF="19">
art di&s;tingui&s;hed from other Men, even in a
manner which thou thy &s;elf knowe&s;t is not
appointed by King <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> For verily, <HI>Ben|jamin,</HI>
the Robes of Di&s;tinction which thou
weare&s;t, and wherewith thou art honoured
among Men, are the En&s;igns of that u&s;urp'd
Power which thou ha&s;t &s;o worthily condemn|ed,
and thou can&s;t not longer abide among
tho&s;e who thou knowe&s;t are the Enemies to
the Light which thou ha&s;t receiv'd, and who
walk contrary to the Doctrine which thou
ha&s;t taught, and which we the Lord's People
have &s;o many Years ago receiv'd.</P>
<P>Wherefore I am mov'd to adverti&s;e thee,
in behalf of the Truth, that thou &s;hould&s;t
not delay any longer joining thy &s;elf unto
the Lord's People, who&s;e Cau&s;e thou ha&s;t
already &s;o worthily pleaded: For why
&s;hould&s;t thou not cau&s;e thy Life and thy
Doctrine to conform unto each other? And
why &s;hould&s;t thou decline to profe&s;s openly
thy adherence to the Lord's People, whil&s;t
thou do&s;t not decline to teach the Principles
which they believe, and which they have re|ceived
from the beginning?</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> the mean and hum|ble
Station of tho&s;e who be Teachers and
Mini&s;ters of the Lord among us, may not
be agreeable to thy pre&s;ent Temper, who art
exalted to be great among Men; but where|as
thou knowe&s;t that the Kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
is not of this World, and that likewi&s;e <HI>his
Rewards are not of this World,</HI> as thou ha&s;t
mo&s;t worthily taught; &s;o <HI>Benjamin,</HI> how
&s;hould&s;t thou not reject the Honours given
by Men, which are the Rewards i&s;&s;uing from
that u&s;urped Power which is not according
to the Laws of <HI>his Kingdom</HI>! The&s;e &s;incere|ly,
according to thy own Rules, are not of
God, neither can&s;t thou, who art now en|lightned
from a higher Spirit, &s;ubmit to be
deck'd with their Ornaments, but &s;hould&s;t
ca&s;t them off, like as Chri&s;tians in Primitive
Times refu&s;ed to be deck'd with the <HI>Garlands</HI>
and <HI>Ve&s;tments</HI> of Idolatrous Prie&s;ts; and
like as tho&s;e People who are called <HI>Prote|&s;tants,</HI>
refu&s;e and dete&s;t the Habiliments and
Ve&s;tments, Titles, Dignities and Di&s;tinctions,
of the Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts, choo&s;ing to be called
by the truly venerable Name of <HI>Mini&s;ters of
Chri&s;t,</HI> rather than by the Titles of <HI>Popes,
Cardinals, Abbots, Monks, Friers,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much then as the U&s;urpers of the
Power and Authority of <HI>King Je&s;us</HI> have
manife&s;tly invaded his Crown and Judicatory
al&s;o, as thou ha&s;t &s;aid, and have &s;et up
Marks of their u&s;urp'd Authority, <HI>to wit,</HI>
their Antichri&s;tian <HI>Excommunications, Ab&s;o|lutions,
Exorci&s;ms,</HI> and other profane Pra|ctices,
and have likewi&s;e given Honours,
which our Lord and only Soveraign <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> never gave, it &s;eemeth unto me, that
thou <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who ha&s;t &s;o manfully de|throned
their Power and Authority, and
ha&s;t expo&s;ed their U&s;urpation to &s;uch Con|tempt,
or at lea&s;t ha&s;t contemned it in thy
Heart, and with the Words of thy Mouth;
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> it &s;eemeth unto me that thou can&s;t
not receive the Honours given by that u&s;ur|ped
Authority without &s;ome Breach upon
the afore&s;aid Declaration of thy Principles,
and acting therein contrary to the Light
which is within thee.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I admoni&s;h thee
to con&s;ider that thou can&s;t not abide in the
Truth which thou ha&s;t now taught in thy
Speaking Place, and publi&s;hed with boldne&s;s
in Printed Papers, unle&s;s thou <HI>come&s;t out</HI> from
among that &s;ort of People, of whom thou
art &s;aid now to be a Ruler; <HI>fora&s;much</HI> as
thou ha&s;t declared them to be Workers of
Iniquity, and Sons of <HI>Belial:</HI> Thy Con&s;ci|ence
therefore will not &s;uffer thee to be call|ed
any longer by their Name; neither can&s;t
thou be found any longer to own and join
thy &s;elf unto them: Can&s;t thou, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
be joined unto U&s;urpers of the Authority of
thy Ma&s;ter and King? Can&s;t thou &s;hare his
Power, whom thou ha&s;t &s;o loudly declared
to be the <HI>&s;ole Lawgiver</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> of his
Kingdom? Do not the&s;e Men continue their
U&s;urpations? Do they not continue to
<PB N="23" REF="22">
claim that Authority which, <HI>as thou ha&s;t &s;aid,</HI>
appertains only to Chri&s;t the King? And
thou knowe&s;t, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> they will continue
to claim the &s;ame, and to exerci&s;e it, as if
it was granted unto them, albeit thou know|e&s;t
that it is not. Wherefore, O Man, re|move
thy &s;elf &s;peedily from the&s;e Men;
yea, I know thou wilt remove thy &s;elf from
them: For why &s;hould&s;t thou be found at
la&s;t in the company of tho&s;e Men whom
thou ha&s;t filled with Contempt, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> They
are Enemies to the Kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the
World.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou ha&s;t done well in
that thou ha&s;t openly declared the Iniquity
of tho&s;e who have armed them&s;elves with
unlawful Power, and have exerci&s;ed Ty|ranny
over their Brethren, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> Ye mu&s;t
join with us, otherwi&s;e ye &s;hall go to Pri|&s;on;
or otherwi&s;e you &s;hall have no Ho|nour,
or Part or Lot among us; whereas
King <HI>Je&s;us</HI> never left any &s;uch Command|ment:
But it remaineth as a Difficulty, or
Doubt, unto us who are Friends, how thou
can&s;t, O <HI>Benjamin,</HI> lay a Confederacy with
the&s;e Men! Art not thou therein an U&s;ur|per
al&s;o with them of the Power and Au|thority
of thy only Lord and King; and
that in a much gro&s;&s;er manner than they?
Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> if thou come not out
from among them, thou wilt give occa&s;ion
<PB N="24" REF="23">
to wicked Men to &s;ay of thee, that thou
ha&s;t &s;aid that in thy Teaching Office which
thou wilt not put in practice in thy own
Per&s;on; and they will &s;peak evil words of
thee, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> Thou teache&s;t Men to do what
thou &s;hunne&s;t to do thy &s;elf; and that thou
&s;hunne&s;t not tho&s;e things which thou teach|e&s;t
others to &s;hun and avoid. Moreover,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> Art thou not even at this time,
and after the &s;imilitude of thine own words,
according to thy own Doctrine, an U&s;urper
of the Authority of <HI>King Je&s;us,</HI> in that
thou continue&s;t to exerci&s;e that &s;ame Power,
of which thou ha&s;t &s;aid that <HI>King Je&s;us</HI>
gave no &s;uch Power unto Men, <HI>to wit,</HI> that
profane unlawful Power which tho&s;e whom
Men call Bi&s;hops generally exerci&s;e over
their Brethren, oppre&s;&s;ing the Lord's People
in their ungodly Courts. Do&s;t thou not
pre&s;ide in thy u&s;urped Judicature, exerci&s;ing
that Power there which thou ha&s;t &s;aid, <HI>the
Lord hath not given thee a Right to exerci&s;e</HI>?
And do&s;t thou not there make u&s;e of tho&s;e
things which thou ha&s;t owned to be <HI>Trifles</HI>
and <HI>Nullities,</HI> to wit, <HI>Excommunications,
Ab&s;olutions,</HI> and &s;uch like things? I &s;ay,
Do&s;t thou not &s;uffer the&s;e things to be done
in thy Name, to the Subjects of thy Lord,
in tho&s;e Seats of Evil Men called Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick
Courts? And how can&s;t thou do this
after thou ha&s;t &s;o plainly told us, that this
<PB N="25" REF="24">
is to make thy &s;elf King in the &s;tead of thy
King Je&s;us. Nay, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> in this
thou ha&s;t not done well; <HI>fora&s;much al&s;o,</HI> as
thou ha&s;t &s;inned herein again&s;t the Light
that is in thee, and ha&s;t cau&s;ed thy Feet to
tread a&s;ide out of the Path of Truth, which
thou ha&s;t chalked out for others, that they
might walk therein: But I tru&s;t that thou wilt
be guided by the good Spirit, and by the
light of Truth &s;hining in thy Soul, and then
thou wilt be &s;ure to come away and remove
from the Tents of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as I know
that the Truth hath been &s;poken by thee,
I warn thee, for thy good, that thou come
out &s;peedily from among them; lay down
thy painted Ve&s;tments, and prophane Trin|kets,
the En&s;igns of that U&s;urpation upon
thy Lord and Ma&s;ter's Kingdom, which thou
ha&s;t &s;o faithfully born thy Te&s;timony a|gain&s;t;
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I exhort thee to lay them
down &s;peedily, and come out from among
them forthwith, <HI>joyning thy &s;elf unto us,</HI>
who&s;e Principles thou ha&s;t acknowledged:
So &s;hall thy Life and Doctrine be Uniform,
and thou &s;halt be &s;ure to de&s;erve that Ble&s;|&s;ing
which attends tho&s;e who are not a&s;ha|med
to Practice the things which they Pro|fe&s;s.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> this will enable thee
to overcome the Gain&s;ayers; for behold
<PB N="26" REF="25">
they do already upbraid thee herewith; and
verily the Man called <HI>Andrew Snape,</HI> hath
&s;poken unto thee Words of &s;corning with
boldne&s;s, in a Book which he &s;tileth, a Let|ter
written unto thee; and in the Twenty
and Fifth Page thereof, that <HI>if the Ca&s;e be as
thou ha&s;t &s;aid, it is the</HI> Men called Par&s;ons,
<HI>have nothing more to do but to throw up their
Orders, &s;ince their Church hath no need of them,
and &s;ince they not only do no Service, but are
Guilty of a Criminal &V;&s;urpation.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e hath the &s;ame <HI>Andrew Snape</HI> &s;aid
unto thee in his &s;aid Book, and in the Thirty
and Sixth Page thereof, the&s;e words, <HI>to wit,</HI>
That he doth not &s;ee <HI>how, upon the&s;e Princi|ples,
thou can&s;t take thy place in the Provincial
Sanhedrim of the Prie&s;ts,</HI> or how <HI>thou can&s;t
require Sub&s;criptions or Declarations of tho&s;e
of the Sons of the Prophets whom thou do&s;t ad|mit
to the Prie&s;thood among thy People,</HI> or how
<HI>thou can&s;t Exerci&s;e almo&s;t any Act of Epi&s;copal
Juri&s;diction.</HI></P>
<P>Now verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> albeit this &s;ame
<HI>Andrew Snape</HI> is a Man by his Profe&s;&s;ion in
an evil way, and &s;uch as I allow not to be
according to the Truth; yet neverthele&s;s
herein hath he &s;poken unto thee words
which thou &s;houlde&s;t con&s;ider well of; for
that they are of weight unto thee, <HI>to wit,</HI>
That thou &s;hould&s;t &s;eparate thy &s;elf from E|vil-doers,
who&s;e ways thou knowe&s;t to be
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Wrong; and that whereas thou ha&s;t con|demned
them for U&s;urpation, and Inva&s;ion
of the Kingdom of <HI>King Je&s;us,</HI> thou &s;hould|e&s;t
not at the &s;ame time continue among
them, or &s;it in thy Seat in their A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Moreover, it &s;eemeth unto me, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that whereas thou ha&s;t replied to <HI>Andrew
Snape</HI> in har&s;h Words, &s;aying, That he hath
evil entreated thee, and hath written bitter
things again&s;t thee, and things which &s;a|vour
not of Truth; yet neverthele&s;s, I per|ceive
that thou ha&s;t not &s;aid one word unto
him to Gain&s;ay what he hath told thee con|cerning
thy coming out from among them,
or that thou can&s;t not, by thy own Princi|ples,
take thy Seat in the A&s;&s;embly of thy
Prie&s;ts; wherefore I rejoice in thy behalf,
nothing doubting but that thou wilt come
and join thy &s;elf with the Lord's People,
who are Friends unto the Truth, and unto
all that thou ha&s;t &s;aid of the U&s;urpation of
Men, and as I have already given thee to
under&s;tand, have many Years received the
Truths which thou ha&s;t Preached at this
day.</P>
<P>Neither let it grieve thee, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that thou &s;halt relinqui&s;h the things which
Men call Honours and Greatne&s;s, and &s;halt
lo&s;e thereby the Advantages and Profits
which thou do&s;t now receive; fora&s;much as
thou knowe&s;t that the Rewards of the King|dom
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<HI>of Je&s;us,</HI> are <HI>not of this World;</HI> and if
the Rewards of this World are the Sanctions
of the Kingdom whereof thou ha&s;t &s;poken,
then it is not of <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> So that thou &s;halt
only relinqui&s;h the Rewards of this World,
and &s;halt &s;eek the Rewards of that Kingdom
which is not of this World.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;o naturally drawn
from thy own words, I tru&s;t thou wilt not
He&s;itate thereat, but wilt accept of my
whole&s;ome Advice, and &s;hew thy &s;elf not to
be a&s;hamed of the practi&s;ing tho&s;e things
whereof thou ha&s;t te&s;tify'd, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That they
are True.</P>
<P>Neither can&s;t thou, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> be
in danger of joyning with any other People
than tho&s;e, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion I have here in|vited
thee to; &s;ince there are not any who
have received the Truths which thou ha&s;t
Preached in their full Degrees, &s;o as the
People, who in contempt are called <HI>Quakers;</HI>
with whom, as I have &s;hewed, thou ha&s;t per|fectly
conformed thy &s;elf to the Honour of
thy Judgment, and of the divine Light &s;hew|ing
forth in thee.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e People called <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
thou can&s;t by no means joyn thy &s;elf unto
them, &s;eeing they have declared them&s;elves
in Terms greatly oppo&s;ite to thy Doctrines,
&s;aying, That Men have Power to make Laws,
binding the Con&s;ciences of others; and that
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Rewards and Puni&s;hments of this World ap|pertain
to Humane Authority, exerci&s;ed by
&s;uch as they call a Succe&s;&s;ion of Officers:
The&s;e their Opinions are not according to
Truth, as Friends have received it; neither
are they like unto tho&s;e. Truths which thou
ha&s;t Preached: And therefore we &s;ee that
que&s;tionle&s;s thou wilt avoid al&s;o the Errone|ous
Opinions of Per&s;ecuting <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
and wilt joyn thy &s;elf unto us; and this I
&s;peak unto thee with the more certainty, <HI>for|a&s;much</HI>
as, Ble&s;&s;ed by the Lord, thou art al|ready
come beyond the corrupt Tenets of
tho&s;e People: Moreover, beloved Friend
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> I make known unto thee, that the
&s;aid <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are equally guilty of tho&s;e
things which the People of the Lord abhor;
<HI>to wit,</HI> The pretences to a Power, which, as
thou &s;aid&s;t well, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the King of all tho&s;e
who are led by the light of the Truth, never
delegated to them; and this they not only
give to their Followers, but make Laws of
their own; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> Humane Laws, and Sanc|tions
of Laws, &s;uch as Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments,
for enforcing others to comply there|with;
to wit, That they admit none to be
Teachers among them, or to Preach and
Prophe&s;y unto the People, unle&s;s they pro|fe&s;s
to believe and to receive certain Points
which they call <HI>prophanely,</HI> Articles of Faith;
<PB N="30" REF="29">
wherein the&s;e wicked u&s;urpations of Power
are openly declared by them, &s;aying,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>1. "That the Lord Je&s;us, as King and
Head of his Church, hath therein appoint|ed
a Government in the hand of Church-Officers
di&s;tinct from the Civil Magi|&s;trate."</P>
<P>2. "That to the&s;e Officers the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven are committed;
by Vertue whereof they have Power re|&s;pectively
to Retain and Remit Sins, to &s;hut
that Kingdom again&s;t the Impenitent, both
by the Word and Cen&s;ures, and to open
it unto penitent Sinners, by the Mini&s;try
of the Go&s;pel, and by Ab&s;olution from
Cen&s;ures, as occa&s;ion &s;hall require."</P>
<P>3. "That the&s;e Church Cen&s;ures are ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for preventing the Wrath of
God, which might fall upon the Church,
if they &s;hould &s;uffer the Seal of the Cove|nant
to be prophaned by Notorious and
Ob&s;tinate Offenders."</P></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e things thou knowe&s;t, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> are
contrary to the Doctrines and Po&s;itions
which thou ha&s;t &s;o openly avowed, being no
le&s;s than Inva&s;ions, and manife&s;t U&s;urpati|ons,
of the Kingdom and Authority of King
Je&s;us, and in them&s;elves <HI>Nullities</HI> and <HI>Trifles.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the&s;e things, and in the&s;e Words,
thou wilt find in tho&s;e <HI>Heads of Belief,</HI> which
the&s;e ungodly <HI>Presbyterians</HI> call the Confe&s;&s;i|on

thee all the&s;e wicked and erroneous O|pinions,

thou wilt at length joyn thy &s;elf unto us;
