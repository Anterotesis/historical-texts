<P>IF Chaucer had not exi&s;ted, the compo&s;itions of John Gower, the next poet in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would alone have been &s;ufficient to re&s;cue the reigns of Edward the third and Richard the &s;econd from the imputation of barbari&s;m. His education was liberal and uncircum&s;cribed, his cour&s;e of reading exten&s;ive, and he tempered his &s;everer &s;tudies with a knowledge of life. By a critical cultivation of his native language, he laboured to reform its irregularities, and to e&s;tabli&s;h an Engli&s;h &s;tyle <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. i. pag. 342.</NOTE>. In the&s;e re&s;pects he re&s;embled his friend and cotemporary Chaucer <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It is certain that they both lived and wrote together.

elegance. His language is tolerably per&s;picuous, and his ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ication often harmonious: but his poetry is of a grave and &s;ententious turn. He has much good &s;en&s;e, &s;olid re|flection, and u&s;eful ob&s;ervation. But he is &s;erious and di|dactic on all occa&s;ions: he pre&s;erves the tone of the &s;cholar and the morali&s;t on the mo&s;t lively topics. For this rea&s;on he &s;eems to have been characteri&s;ed by Chaucer with the appellation of the MORALL Gower <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Troil. Cre&s;&s;. ad calc. pag. 333. edit. Urr. ut &s;upr.</NOTE>. But his talent is not confined to Engli&s;h ver&s;e only. He wrote al&s;o in Latin; and copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d Ovid's elegiacs with &s;ome degree of purity, and with fewer fal&s;e quantities and corrupt phra&s;es, than any of our countrymen had yet exhibited &s;ince the twelfth century.</P>
<P>Gower's capital work, con&s;i&s;ting of three parts, only the la&s;t of which properly furni&s;hes matter for our pre&s;ent en|quiry, is entitled SPECULUM MEDITANTIS, VOX CLAMANTIS, CONFESSIO AMANTIS. It was fini&s;hed, at lea&s;t the third part, in the year 1393 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">CONFESS. AMANT. Prol. fol. 1. a. col. 1. Imprinted at London, in Flete|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">rete, by Thomas Berthelette, the xii. daie of March, ann. 1554. folio. This edition is here always cited.</NOTE>. The SPECULUM MEDITANTIS, or the <HI>Mirrour of Meditation,</HI> is written in French rhymes, in ten books <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bibl. Bodl. MSS. Bodl. NE. F. 8. 9. And MSS. Fairf. 3.</NOTE>. This tract, which was never printed, di&s;plays the general nature of virtue and vice, enumerates the felicities of conjugal fidelity by examples &s;elected from various authors, and de&s;cribes the path which the reprobate ought to pur&s;ue for the recovery of the divine grace. The VOX CLAMANTIS, or the <HI>Voice of one crying in the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> which was al&s;o never printed, contains &s;even books of Latin elegiacs. This work is chiefly hi&s;torical, and is little more than a metrical chro|nicle of the in&s;urrection of the commons in the reign of king Richard the &s;econd. The be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful ma|nu&s;cript of it is in the library of All Souls college at Oxford; with a dedication in Latin ver&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed by the author,

There is a fine manu&s;cript of it in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. It was written in the year 1397, as appears by the following line, MSS. Bodl. 294.
<Q><L>Hos ego BIS DENO Ricardi regis in anno.</L></Q></NOTE>. The CONFESSIO AMANTIS, or the <HI>Lover's Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> is an Engli&s;h poem, in eight books, fir&s;t printed by Caxton, in the year 1483. It was written at the command of Richard the &s;econd; who meeting our poet Gower rowing on the Thames near London, invited him into the royal barge, and after much conver&s;ation reque&s;ted him to <HI>book &s;ome new thing</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">TO THE REDER, in Berthlette's edi|tion. From the PROLOGUE. See &s;upr. vol. i. p. 539. Notes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This tripartite work is repre&s;ented by three volumes on Gower's curious tomb in the conventual church of Saint Mary Overee in Southwark, now remaining in its antient &s;tate; and this circum&s;tance furni&s;hes me with an obvious opportunity of adding an anecdote relating to our poet's munificence and piety, which ought not to be omitted. Al|though a poet, he largely contributed to rebuild that church in its pre&s;ent elegant form, and to render it a beautiful pattern of the lighter Gothic architecture: at the &s;ame time he founded, at his tomb, a perpetual chantry.</P>
<P>It is on the la&s;t of the&s;e pieces, the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, that Gower's character and reputation as a poet are almo&s;t entirely founded. This poem, which bears no immediate reference to the other two divi&s;ions, is a dialogue between a lover and his confe&s;&s;or, who is a prie&s;t of Venus, and, like the my&s;tagogue in the PICTURE of Cebes, is called Genius. Here, as if it had been impo&s;&s;ible for a lover not to be a good catholic, the ritual of religion is applied to the tender pa&s;&s;ion, and Ovid's Art of Love is blended with the breviary. In the cour&s;e of the confe&s;&s;ion, every evil affection of the human heart, which may tend to impede the progre&s;s or counteract the &s;ucce&s;s of love, is &s;cientifically &s;ubdivided; and its fatal effects exemplifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d by a variety of appo&s;ite &s;tories, extracted
<PB N="4" REF="10">
from cla&s;&s;ics and chronicles. The poet often introduces or recapitulates his matter in a few couplets of Latin long and &s;hort ver&s;es. This was in imitation of Boethius.</P>
<P>This poem is &s;trongly tinctured with tho&s;e pedantic af|fectations concerning the pa&s;&s;ion of love, which the French and Italian poets of the fourteenth century borrowed from the troubadours of Provence, and which I have above exa|mined at large. But the writer's particular model appears more immediately to have been John of Meun's celebrated ROMAUNT DE LA ROSE. He has, however, &s;eldom attempted to imitate the picture&s;que imageries, and expre&s;&s;ive per&s;onifi|cations, of that exqui&s;ite allegory. His mo&s;t &s;triking pour|traits, which yet are conceived with no powers of creation, nor delineated with any fertility of fancy, are IDLENESS, AVA|RICE, MICHERIE or Thieving, and NEGLIGENCE, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ecretary of SLOTH <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. f. 62. a. col. 1. Lib. v. f. 94. a. col. 1. Lib. iv. f. 68. a. col. 1. Lib. v. f. 119. a col. 2.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of boldly cloathing the&s;e qualities with corporeal attributes, aptly and poetically imagined, he coldly yet &s;en&s;ibly de&s;cribes their operations, and enumerates their properties. What Gower wanted in invention, he &s;upplied from his common-place book; which appears to have been &s;tored with an inexhau&s;tible fund of in&s;tructive maxims, plea&s;ant narrations, and philo&s;ophical definitions. It &s;eems to have been his object to croud all his erudition into this elaborate performance. Yet there is often &s;ome degree of contrivance and art in his manner of introducing and adapting &s;ubjects of a very di&s;tant nature, and which are totally foreign to his general de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In the fourth book, our confe&s;&s;or turns chemi&s;t; and di&s;|cour&s;ing at large on the Hermetic &s;cience, developes its principles, and expo&s;es its abu&s;es, with great penetration <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. f. 76. b. col. 2.</NOTE>. He delivers the doctrines concerning the vegetable, mineral,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
and animal &s;tones, to which Fal&s;taffe alludes in Shake&s;peare <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">taffe mentions a philo&s;opher's or che|mi&s;t's <HI>two &s;tones.</HI> See P. Henr. iv. Act iii. Sc. 2. Our author abundantly confirms doctor Warburton's explication of this pa&s;&s;age, which the re&s;t of the commentators do not &s;eem to have under&s;tood. See A&s;hm. Theatr. Chemic. p. 484. edit. Lond. 1652. 4to.</NOTE>, with amazing accuracy and per&s;picuity <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 77. a. col. 1.</NOTE>; although this doctrine was adopted from &s;y&s;tems then in vogue, as we &s;hall &s;ee below. In another place he applies the Argo|nautic expedition in &s;earch of the golden fleece, which he relates at length, to the &s;ame vi&s;ionary philo&s;ophy <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lib. v. f. 101. a. &s;eq.</NOTE>. Gower very probably conducted his a&s;&s;ociate Chaucer into the&s;e pro|found my&s;teries, which had been ju&s;t opened to our country|men by the books of Roger Bacon <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. 1. p. 425.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh book, the whole circle of the Ari&s;totelic philo&s;ophy is explained; which our lover is de&s;irous to learn, &s;uppo&s;ing that the importance and variety of its &s;peculations might conduce to &s;ooth his anxieties by diverting and en|gaging his attention. Such a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was not very likely to afford him much con&s;olation: e&s;pecially, as hardly a &s;ingle ornamental digre&s;&s;ion is admitted, to decorate a field na|turally &s;o de&s;titute of flowers. Almo&s;t the only one is the following de&s;cription of the chariot and crown of the &s;un; in which the Arabian ideas concerning precious &s;tones are interwoven with Ovid's fictions and the cla&s;&s;ical mythology.</P>

of &s;tyle, and other arts of compo&s;ition, which an attention to the genuine models would have afforded, but by being written without any ideas of elegance, and in the mo&s;t barbarous phra&s;eology. Yet productive as they were of the&s;e and other inconvenient con&s;equences, they were not without their u&s;e in the rude periods of literature. By gradually weaning the minds of readers from monki&s;h legends, they introduced a reli&s;h for real and rational hi&s;tory; and kindling an ardour of inquiring into the tran&s;actions of pa&s;t ages, at length awakened a curio&s;ity to obtain a more accurate and authentic knowledge of important events by &s;earching the original authors. Nor are they to be entirely neglected in modern and more poli&s;hed ages. For, be&s;ides that they contain curious pictures of the credulity and ignorance of our ance&s;tors, they frequently pre&s;erve facts tran&s;cribed from books which have not de&s;cended to po&s;terity.

<P>I believe on the whole, that Chaucer had publi&s;hed mo&s;t of his poems before this piece of Gower appeared. Chaucer had not however at this time written his TESTAMENT OF LOVE: for Gower, in a &s;ort of Epilogue to the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, is addre&s;&s;ed by Venus, who commands him to greet Chaucer as her favourite poet and di&s;ciple, as one who had employed his youth in compo&s;ing &s;ongs and ditties to her honour. She adds at the clo&s;e,</P>

<P>Chaucer at this time was &s;ixty-five years of age. The Court of Love, one of the pedantries of French gallantry, occurs often.

<P>There are al&s;o many manife&s;t evidences which lead us to conclude, that this poem preceded Chaucer's CANTERBURY'S TALES, undoubtedly &s;ome of that poet's late&s;t compo&s;itions, and probably not begun till after the year 1382. The MAN OF LAWES TALE is circum&s;tantially borrowed from Gower's CONSTANTIA <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Conf. Amant. Lib. ii f. 30. b. col. 2. See particularly, ibid. f. 35. b. col. 2. a. col. 1.

I have ju&s;t di&s;covered, that the favourite &s;tory of Apollonius, having appeared in antient Greek, Latin, Saxon, barbarous Greek, and old French, was at length tran&s;lated from French into Engli&s;h, and printed in the black letter, by Wynkyn de Worde, A.

Although the GESTA ROMANORUM might have furni&s;hed both poets with this narrative. Chaucer, however, among other great improvements, has judiciou&s;ly departed from the fable, in converting Sicily into the more popular court of king Arthur.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in e&s;timating Gower's merit, I have pu&s;hed the notion too far, that becau&s;e he &s;hews &s;o much learning he had no great &s;hare of natural abilities. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that when books began to grow fa&s;hionable, and the reputation of learning conferred the highe&s;t honour, poets became ambitious of being thought &s;cholars; and &s;a|crificed their native powers of invention to the o&s;tentation of di&s;playing an exten&s;ive cour&s;e of reading, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the pride of profound erudition. On this account, the min&s;trels of the&s;e times, who were totally uneducated, and poured forth &s;pontaneous rhymes in obedience to the workings of nature, often exhibit more genuine &s;trokes of pa&s;&s;ion and imagina|tion, than the profe&s;&s;ed poets. Chaucer is an exception to this ob&s;ervation: who&s;e original feelings were too &s;trong to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by books, and who&s;e learning was overbalanced by genius.</P>
<P>This affectation of appearing learned, which yet was natural at the revival of literature, in our old poets, even in tho&s;e who were altogether de&s;titute of talents, has lo&s;t to po&s;terity many a curious picture of manners, and many a romantic image. Some of our antient bards, however, aimed at no other merit, than that of being able to ver&s;ify; and attempted nothing more, than to cloath in rhyme tho&s;e &s;entiments, which would have appeared with equal propriety in pro&s;e.</P>

according to which, Chaucer's portraiture was made on his monument, in the chapel of Saint Bla&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter|abbey, by the benefaction of Nicholas Brigham, in the year 1556 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">He was of Caver&s;ham in Oxford&s;hire.

Occleve him&s;elf mentions this drawing in his CONSOLATIO SERVILIS. It exactly re&s;embles the curious picture on board of our venerable bard, pre&s;erved in the Bodleian gallery at Oxford. I have a very old picture of Chaucer on board, much like Occleve's, formerly kept in Chaucer's hou&s;e, a quadrangular &s;tone-man&s;ion, at Wood&s;tock in Oxford&s;hire; which commanded a pro&s;pect of the ancient magnificent royal palace, and of many beautiful &s;cenes in the adjacent park: and who&s;e la&s;t remains, chiefly con&s;i&s;ting of what was called Chaucer's bed-chamber, with an old carved oaken roof, evidently original, were demoli&s;hed about fifteen years ago.

was a &s;ingular promoter of literature, and, however unqua|lified for political intrigues, the common patron of the &s;cholars of the times. A &s;ketch of his character in that view, is therefore too clo&s;ely connected with our &s;ubject to be cen&s;ured as an unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion. About the year 1440, he gave to the univer&s;ity of Oxford a library containing &s;ix hundred volumes, only one hundred and twenty of which were valued at more than one thou&s;and pounds.

<P>I clo&s;e this &s;ection with an apology for Chaucer, Gower, and Occleve; who are &s;uppo&s;ed, by the &s;evere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> etymologi&s;ts, to have corrupted the purity of the Engli&s;h language, by affecting to introduce &s;o many foreign words and phra&s;es. But if we attend only to the politics of the times, we &s;hall find the&s;e poets, as al&s;o &s;ome of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, much le&s;s blameable in this re&s;pect, than the critics imagine. Our wars with France, which began in the reign of Edward the third, were of long continuance. The principal nobility of England, at this period, re&s;ided in France, with their fami|lies, for many years. John king of France kept his court in England; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o which, exclu&s;ive of the&s;e French lords who were his fellow-pri&s;oners, or nece&s;&s;ary attendants, the chief nobles of his kingdom mu&s;t have occa&s;ionally re&s;orted. Ed|ward the black prince made an expedition into Spain. John of Gaunt duke of Lanca&s;ter, and his brother the duke of York, were matched with the daughters of Don Pedro king of Ca&s;tile. All the&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t have concurred to produce a perceptible change in the language of the court. It is rational therefore, and it is equitable to &s;uppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of coining new words, they only complied with the common and fa&s;hionable modes of &s;peech. Would Chaucer's poems have been the delight of tho&s;e courts in which he lived, had they been filled with unintelligible pedantries? The cotemporaries of the&s;e poets never complained of their ob&s;curity. But whether defen&s;ible on the&s;e principles or not, they much improved the vernacular &s;tyle by the u&s;e of this exotic phra&s;eology. It was thus that our primitive diction was enlarged and enriched. The Engli&s;h language owes its copiou&s;ne&s;s, elegance, and harmony, to the&s;e innovations.</P>

<P>I Con&s;ider Chaucer as a genial day in an Engli&s;h &s;pring. A brilliant &s;un enlivens the face of nature with an unu&s;ual lu&s;tre: the &s;udden appearance of cloudle&s;s &s;kies, and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmo&s;phere, after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter, fill our hearts with the vi&s;ionary pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy &s;ummer: and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal &s;erenity. But winter returns with redoubled horrors: the clouds conden&s;e more formidably than before; and tho&s;e tender buds, and early blo&s;&s;oms, which were called forth by the tran&s;ient gleam of a temporary &s;un-&s;hine, are nipped by fro&s;ts, and torn by tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the poets that immediately &s;ucceeded Chaucer, &s;eem rather relap&s;ing into barbari&s;m, than availing them|&s;elves of tho&s;e &s;triking ornaments which his judgment and imagination had di&s;clo&s;ed. They appear to have been in|&s;en&s;ible to his vigour of ver&s;ification, and his flights of fancy. It was not indeed likely that a poet &s;hould &s;oon ari&s;e equal to Chaucer: and it mu&s;t be remembered, that the na|tional di&s;tractions which en&s;ued, had no &s;mall &s;hare in ob|&s;tructing the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e &s;tudies which delight in peace and repo&s;e. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, however, approach him in no degree of proportion. Among the&s;e, John Lydgate is the poet who follows him at the &s;horte&s;t interval.</P>
<P>I have placed Lydgate in the reign of Henry the &s;ixth, and he &s;eems to have arrived at his highe&s;t point of emi|nence about the year 1430 <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">In a copy of Lydgate's <HI>Chronicle of En|gli&s;h Kings,</HI> there is a &s;tanza of Edward the fourth.

appeared before. He was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Bury in Suffolk, and an uncommon ornament of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Yet his genius was &s;o lively, and his accompli&s;h|ments &s;o numerous, that I &s;u&s;pect the holy father &s;aint Benedict would hardly have acknowledged him for a genuine di&s;ciple. After a &s;hort education at Oxford, he travelled into France and Italy <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See one of his DITTIES, MSS. Harl. 2255. 41. fol. 148.
<Q><L>I have been offte in dyvers londys, &amp;c.</L></Q></NOTE>; and returned a complete ma&s;ter of the language and the literature of both countries. He chiefly &s;tudied the Italian and French poets, particularly Dante, Boccacio, and Alain Chartier; and became &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a proficient in polite learning, that he opened a &s;chool in his mona&s;tery, for teaching the &s;ons of the nobility the arts of ver&s;ification, and the elegancies of compo&s;ition. Yet although philology was his object, he was not unfamiliar with the fa&s;hionable philo&s;ophy: he was not only a poet and a rhetorician, but a geometrician, an a&s;tronomer, a the|ologi&s;t, and a di&s;putant. On the whole I am of opinion, that Lydgate made con&s;iderable additions to tho&s;e amplifica|tions of our language, in which Chaucer, Gower, and Oc|cleve led the way: and that he is the fir&s;t of our writers who&s;e &s;tyle is cloathed with that per&s;picuity, in which the Engli&s;h phra&s;eology appears at this day to an Engli&s;h reader.</P>
<P>To enumerate Lydgate's pieces, would be to write the catalogue of a little library. No poet &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater ver&s;atility of talents. He moves with equal ea&s;e in every mode of compo&s;ition. His hymns, and his ballads, have the &s;ame degree of merit: and whether his &s;ubject be the life of a hermit or a hero, of &s;aint Au&s;tin or Guy earl of Warwick, ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic, a
<PB N="53" REF="59">
hi&s;tory or an allegory, he writes with facility. His tran&s;i|tions were rapid from works of the mo&s;t &s;erious and la|borious kind to &s;allies of levity and pieces of popular enter|tainment. His mu&s;e was of univer&s;al acce&s;s; and he was not only the poet of his mona&s;tery, but of the world in general. If a di&s;gui&s;ing was intended by the company of gold&s;miths, a ma&s;k before his maje&s;ty at Eltham, a may|game for the &s;heriffs and aldermen of London, a mumming before the lord mayor, a proce&s;&s;ion of pageants from the creation for the fe&s;tival of Corpus Chri&s;ti, or a carol for the coronation, Lydgate was con&s;ulted and gave the poetry <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See a variety of his pieces of this kind, MSS.

But the&s;e lines will be con&s;idered again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>. It is amazing, that in an age of the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious devotion &s;o little di&s;crimination &s;hould have been made between &s;acred and profane characters and incidents. But the common &s;en&s;e of mankind had not yet attained a ju&s;t e&s;timate of things. Lydgate, in another piece, has ver&s;ified the rubrics of the mi&s;&s;al, which he ap|plies to the god Cupid: and declares, with how much de|light he frequently meditated on the holy legend of tho&s;e con&s;tant martyrs, who were not afraid to &s;uffer death for the faith of that omnipotent divinity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MSS. Fairfax, xvi. Bibl. Bodl.</NOTE>. There are in&s;tances, in which religion was even made the in&s;trument of love. Arnaud Daniel, a celebrated troubadour of the thirteenth century, in a fit of amorous de&s;pair, promi&s;es to found a multitude of annual ma&s;&s;es, and to dedicate perpetual tapers to the &s;hrines of &s;aints, for the important purpo&s;e of obtaining the affections of an obdurate mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>About the year 1360, Boccacio wrote a Latin hi&s;tory in ten books, entitled DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ET FEMINARUM ILLUSTRIUM.

Its la&s;t grand event is John king of France taken pri|&s;oner by the Engli&s;h at the battle of Poitiers, in the year 1359 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Printed at Au&s;bourg. And at Paris, 1544. fol. It is amazing, that Vo&s;&s;ius &s;hould not know the number of books of which this work con&s;i&s;ted, and that it was ever printed. De Hi&s;t. Lat. lib. iii. cap. ii. It was tran&s;lated into Italian by Betu&s;&s;i, in Firenza, 1566. 8vo. 2 volum.</NOTE>. This book of Boccacio was &s;oon afterwards tran|&s;lated into French, by one of whom little more &s;eems to be known, than that he was named Laurence; yet &s;o para|phra&s;tically, and with &s;o many con&s;iderable additions, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> almo&s;t to be rendered a new work <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In Lydgate's PROLOGUE, B. i. fol. i. a col. 1. edit. ut infr.

<P>The work is not improperly &s;tyled a &s;et of tragedies. It is not merely a narrative of men eminent for their rank and misfortunes. The plan is perfectly dramatic, and partly &s;ugge&s;ted by the pageants of the times. Every per&s;onage is &s;uppo&s;ed to appear before the poet, and to relate his re|&s;pective &s;ufferings: and the figures of the&s;e &s;pectres are &s;ometimes finely drawn. Hence a &s;ource is opened for moving compa&s;&s;ion, and for a di&s;play of imagination. In &s;ome of the lives the author replies to the &s;peaker, and a &s;ort of dialogue is introduced for conducting the &s;tory. Brunchild, a queen of France, who murthered all her chil|dren, and was afterwards hewn in pieces, appears thus.</P>

<P>Yet in &s;ome of the&s;e intere&s;ting interviews, our poet ex|cites pity of another kind.

<P>Nor does our dramati&s;t deal only in real characters and hi&s;torical per&s;onages. Boccacio &s;tanding pen&s;ive in his library, is alarmed at the &s;udden entrance of the gigantic and mon&s;trous

<P>I cannot quit this work without adding an ob&s;ervation re|lating to Boccacio, its original author, which perhaps may de&s;erve attention. It is highly probable that Boccacio learn|ed many anecdotes of Grecian hi&s;tory and Grecian fable, not to be found in any Greek writer now extant, from his pre|ceptors Barlaam, Leontius, and others, who had lived at Con&s;tantinople while the Greek literature was yet flouri&s;h|ing. Some of the&s;e are perhaps &s;cattered up and down in the compo&s;ition before us, which contains a con&s;iderable part of the Grecian &s;tory; and e&s;pecially in his treati&s;e of the genealogies of the gods <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In fifteen books. Fir&s;t printed in 1481. fol. And in Italian by Betu&s;&s;i, Venet. 1553. In French at Paris, 1531. fol. In the interpretation of the fables he is very prolix and jejune.</NOTE>.

the Latins <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">GENEAL. DEOR. lib. xv. cap. vi.</NOTE>. He confe&s;&s;es that he took many things in his book of the genealogies of the gods from a va&s;t work entitled COLLECTIVUM, now lo&s;t, written by his cotemporary Paulus Peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inus, the materials of which had in great mea&s;ure been furni&s;hed by Barlaam <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Quicquid apud Graecos inveniri pote&s;t, ADJUTORIO BARLAAE arbitror collegi&s;&s;e."</Q> GENEAL.

Peru&s;inus was librarian, about the year 1340, to Robert king of Jeru&s;alem and Sicily: and was the mo&s;t curious and inqui&s;itive man of his age for &s;earching after unknown or uncommon manu&s;cripts, e&s;pecially hi&s;tories, and poetical compo&s;itions, and particularly &s;uch as were written in Greek. I will beg leave to cite the words of Boccacio, who records this anecdote. <Q REND="inline">"Et, &s;i u&s;quam CURIOSISSIMUS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uit homo in perquirendis, ju&s;&s;u etiam principis, PEREGRINIS undecunque libris, HISTORIIS et POETICIS operibus, i&s;te fuit.

It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that Boccacio, both from his connections and his curio&s;ity, was no &s;tranger to the&s;e trea&s;ures: and that many of the&s;e pieces, thus imported into Italy by the di&s;per&s;ion of the Con&s;tantinopolitan exiles, are only known at pre&s;ent through the medium of his writings. It is cer|tain that many oriental fictions found their way into Europe by means of this communication.</P>

Nor are we only pre&s;ented in this piece with the habits of feudal life, and the practices of chivalry. The poem is en|riched with a multitude of oriental fictions, and Arabian traditions.

Another of Medea's pre&s;ents to Ja&s;on, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this perilous atchievement, is a &s;ilver image, or tali&s;man, which defeated all the powers of incantation, and was framed according to principles of a&s;tronomy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

Mo&s;t of the&s;e extravagancies, and a thou&s;and more, are in Guido de Colonna, who lived when this mode of fabling was at its height.

<P>Colonna, I believe, gave the Trojan &s;tory its romantic additions.

<P>In this detail of the dramatic exhibition which prevailed in the ideal theatre of Troy, a poet, placed on the &s;tage in a pulpit, and characteri&s;tically habited, is &s;aid to have recited a &s;eries of tragical adventures; who&s;e pathetic narrative was afterwards expre&s;&s;ed, by the dumb ge&s;ticulations of a &s;et of ma&s;qued actors. Some perhaps may be inclined to think, that this imperfect &s;pecies of theatric repre&s;entation, was the rude drama of Lydgate's age. But &s;urely Lydgate would not have de&s;cribed at all, much le&s;s in a long and laboured digre&s;&s;ion, a public &s;hew, which from its nature was familiar and notorious. On the contrary, he de&s;cribes it as a thing ob&s;olete, and exi&s;ting only in remote times. Had a more perfect and legitimate &s;tage now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, he would not have deviated from his &s;ubject, to communicate unnece&s;&s;ary in|formation, and to deliver &s;uch minute definitions of tragedy and comedy. On the whole, this formal hi&s;tory of a theatre, conveys nothing more than an affected di&s;play of Lydgate's learning; and is collected, yet with apparent inaccuracy and confu&s;ion of circum&s;tances, from what the antient gram|marians have left concerning the origin of the Greek tragedy.
<PB N="96" REF="102">
Or perhaps it might be borrowed by our author from &s;ome French paraphra&s;tic ver&s;ion of Colonna's Latin romance.</P>
<P>Among the antient authors, be&s;ide tho&s;e already mentioned, cited in this poem, are Lollius for the hi&s;tory of Troy, Ovid for the tale of Medea and Ja&s;on, Uly&s;&s;es and Polyphemus, the Myrmidons and other &s;tories, Statius for Polynices and Eteocles, the venerable Bede, Fulgentius the mythologi&s;t, Ju&s;tinian with who&s;e in&s;titutes Colonna as a civilian mu&s;t have been well acquainted, Pliny, and Jacobus de Vitriaco. The la&s;t is produced to prove, that Philometer, a famous philo|&s;opher, invented the game of che&s;s, to divert a tyrant from his cruel purpo&s;es, in Chaldea; and that from thence it was im|ported into Greece. But Colonna, or rather Lydgate, is of a different opinion; and contends, in oppo&s;ition to his authority, that this game, <HI>&s;o &s;otyll and &s;o marvaylous,</HI> was di&s;covered by <HI>pru|dent clerkes</HI> during the &s;iege of Troy, and fir&s;t practiced in that city.<NOTE PLACE="foot">^y Colonna calls him, <HI>ille</HI> FABULARIUS <HI>Sulmonen&s;is,&mdash;fabulo&s;e commentans,</HI> &amp;c.

This tradition of the invention of che&s;s is mentioned by Jacobus de Vitriaco in his ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL HISTORY <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In three books.</NOTE>. The anec|dote of Philometer is, I think, in Egidius Romanus on this &s;ubject, above-mentioned.

<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over an in&s;tance of Lydgate's gallantry, as it is the gallantry of a monk. Colonna takes all oppor|tunities of &s;atiri&s;ing the fair &s;ex; and Lydgate with great politene&s;s declares him&s;elf ab&s;olutely unwilling to tran&s;late tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of this &s;evere morali&s;t, which contain &s;uch unju&s;t and illiberal mi&s;repre&s;entations of the female cha|racter. In&s;tead of which, to obviate the&s;e injurious reflec|tions, our tran&s;lator enters upon a formal vindication of

the ladies; not by a panegyric on their beauty, nor encomiums on tho&s;e amiable accompli&s;hments, by which they refine our &s;en&s;ibilities, and give elegance to life; but by a di&s;play of that religious fortitude with which &s;ome women have &s;uf|fered martyrdom; or of that inflexible cha&s;tity, by means of which others have been &s;natched up alive into heaven, in a &s;tate of genuine virginity. Among other &s;triking examples which the calendar affords, he mentions the tran&s;cendent grace of the eleven thou&s;and virgins who were martyred at Cologne in Germany. In the mean time, female &s;aints, as I &s;u&s;pect, in the barbarous ages were regarded with a greater degree of re&s;pect, on account of tho&s;e exaggerated ideas of gallantry which chivalry in&s;pired: and it is not improbable that the di&s;tingui&s;hed honours paid to the virgin Mary might have partly proceeded from this principle.</P>
<P>Among the anachroni&s;tic improprieties which this poem contains, &s;ome of which have been pointed out, the mo&s;t con&s;picuous is the fiction of Hector's &s;epulchre, or tomb: which al&s;o merits our attention for another rea&s;on, as it affords us an opportunity of adding &s;ome other notices of the modes of antient architecture to tho&s;e already men|tioned. The poet from Colonna &s;uppo&s;es, that Hector was buried in the principal church of Troy, near the high altar, within a magnificent oratory, erected for that purpo&s;e, exactly re&s;embling the Gothic &s;hrines of our cathedrals, yet charged with many romantic decorations.</P>

<P>Diocle&s;ian, a powerful emperour in Germany, has a rupture with Barnard earl of Tholou&s;e, concerning boun|daries of territory. Contrary to the repeated per&s;ua&s;ions of the empre&s;s, who is extremely beautiful, and famous for her conjugal fidelity, he meets the earl, with a numerous army, in a pitched battle, to decide the quarrel. The earl is victorious, and carries home a great multitude of pri|&s;oners, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of which is &s;ir Tralabas of Turky, whom he treats as his companion. In the mid&s;t of their fe&s;tivities they talk of the beauties of the empre&s;s; the earl's curio&s;ity is inflamed to &s;ee &s;o matchle&s;s a lady, and he promi&s;es liberty to &s;ir Tralabas, if he can be conducted un|known to the emperour's court, and obtain a &s;ight of her without di&s;covery. They both &s;et forward, the earl di&s;|gui&s;ed like a hermit. When they arrive at the emperour's court, &s;ir Tralabas proves fal&s;e: treacherou&s;ly imparts the &s;ecret to the empre&s;s that he has brought with him the earl
<PB N="104" REF="110">
of Tholou&s;e in di&s;gui&s;e, who is enamoured of her celebrated beauty; and propo&s;es to take advantage of &s;o fair an oppor|tunity of killing the emperour's great and avowed enemy. She rejects the propo&s;al with indignation, injoyns the knight not to communicate the &s;ecret any farther, and de&s;ires to &s;ee the earl next day in the chapel at ma&s;s. The next day the earl in his hermit's weeds is conveniently placed at ma&s;s. At leav|ing the chapel, he a&s;ks an alms of the empre&s;s; and &s;he gives him forty florins and a ring. He receives the pre&s;ent of the ring with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and although obliged to return home, in point of prudence, and to avoid detection, comforts him&s;elf with this reflection.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>He then returns home. The emperour is called into &s;ome di&s;tant country; and leaves his con&s;ort in the cu&s;tody of two knights, who attempting to gain her love without &s;uc|ce&s;s, contrive a &s;tratagem to defame her cha&s;tity.

parts of the world; and the earl of Tholou&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing the animo&s;ities which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t between him and the emperour, privately undertakes her quarrel. He appears at the emperour's court in the habit of a monk, and obtains permi&s;&s;ion to act as confe&s;&s;or to the empre&s;s, in her pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation. In the cour&s;e of the confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he pro|te&s;ts that &s;he was always true to the emperour; yet owns that once <HI>&s;he gave a ring to the earl of Tholou&s;e.</HI> The &s;uppo&s;ed confe&s;&s;or pronounces her innocent of the charge brought again&s;t her; on which one of the traiterous knights affirms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the monk was &s;uborned to publi&s;h this confe&s;&s;ion, and that he de&s;erved to be con&s;umed in the &s;ame fire which was prepared for the lady. The monk pretending that the honour of his religion and character was affected by this in&s;inuation, challenges both the knights to combat: they are conquered; and the empre&s;s, after this trial, is declared innocent. He then openly di&s;covers him&s;elf to be the earl of Tholou&s;e, the emperour's antient enemy. A &s;olemn re|conciliation en&s;ues. The earl is appointed &s;ene&s;chal of the emperour's domain. The emperour lives only three years, and the earl is married to the empre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the execution of this performance, our author was obliged to be conci&s;e, as the poem was intended to be &s;ung to the harp. Yet, when he breaks through this re&s;traint, in|&s;tead of dwelling on &s;ome of the beautiful &s;ituations which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;tory affords, he is diffu&s;e in di&s;playing trivial and un|important circum&s;tances. The&s;e popular poets are never &s;o happy, as when they are de&s;cribing a battle or a fea&s;t.</P>
<P>It will not perhaps be deemed impertinent to ob&s;erve, that about this period the min&s;trels were often more amply paid than the clergy. In this age, as in more enlightened times, the people loved better to be plea&s;ed than in&s;tructed. During many of the years of the reign of Henry the &s;ixth, particularly in the year 1430, at the annual fea&s;t of the fraternity of the HOLIE CROSSE at Abingdon, a town in

before I proceed in my &s;eries, I will employ the remainder of this &s;ection in fixing the reader's attention on an im|portant circum&s;tance, now operating in its full extent, and therefore purpo&s;ely re&s;erved for this period, which greatly contributed to the improvement of our literature, and con|&s;equently of our poetry: I mean the many tran&s;lations of Latin books, e&s;pecially cla&s;&s;ics, which the French had been making for about the two la&s;t centuries, and were &s;till con|tinuing to make, into their own language. In order to do this more effectually, I will collect into one view the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the&s;e ver&s;ions: not &s;olicitous about tho&s;e notices on this &s;ubject which have before occurred inciden|tally; nor &s;crupulous about the charge of anticipation, which, to prepare the reader, I &s;hall perhaps incur by lengthening this enquiry, for the &s;ake of comprehen&s;ion, beyond the limits of the period ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned. In the mean time it may be pertinent to premi&s;e, that from the clo&s;e communication which formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between England and France, manu&s;cript copies of many of the&s;e tran&s;lations, elegantly written, and often embelli&s;hed with the mo&s;t &s;plendid illu|minations and curious miniatures, were pre&s;ented by the tran&s;lators or their patrons to the kings of England; and that they accordingly appear at pre&s;ent among the royal manu&s;cripts in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.

In&s;tead of procuring laborious and expen&s;ive tran&s;lations of the antient fathers, the printers, who multiplied greatly to|wards the clo&s;e of this century, found their advantage in publi&s;hing new tran&s;lations of more agreeable books, or in giving antient ver&s;ions in a modern dre&s;s <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I take this opportunity of ob&s;erving, that one of the&s;e was the romance of &s;ir LANCELOT DU LAC, tran&s;lated from the Latin by Robert de Borron, at the com|mand of our Henry the &s;econd or third.

<P>I am not exactly informed, when the ENEID of Virgil was tran&s;lated into a &s;ort of metrical romance or hi&s;tory of Eneas,

under the title of LIVRE D' ENEIDOS COMPILE PAR VIRGILE, by Guillaume de Roy. But that tran&s;lation was printed at Lyons in 1483, and appears to have been fini&s;hed not many years before.

<P>The conclu&s;ion intended to be drawn from this long di|gre&s;&s;ion is obvious. By means of the&s;e French tran&s;lations, our countrymen, who under&s;tood French much better than Latin, became acquainted with many u&s;eful books which they would not otherwi&s;e have known. With &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;|tances, a commodious acce&s;s to the cla&s;&s;ics was opened, and the knowledge of antient literature facilitated and famili|ari&s;ed in England, at a much earlier period than is imagined; and at a time, when little more than the productions of &s;pe|culative monks, and irrefragrable doctors, could be obtained or were &s;tudied. Very few Engli&s;hmen, I will venture to pronounce, had read Livy before the tran&s;lation of Ber|cheur was imported by the regent duke of Bedford. It is certain that many of the Roman poets and hi&s;torians were now read in England, in the original. But the Latin lan|guage was for the mo&s;t part confined to a few eccle&s;ia&s;tics. When the&s;e authors, therefore, appeared in a language almo&s;t as intelligible as the Engli&s;h, they fell into the hands of illiterate and common readers, and contributed to &s;ow the &s;eeds of a national erudition, and to form a popular ta&s;te.
<PB N="123" REF="129">
Even the French ver&s;ions of the religious, philo&s;ophical, hi&s;torical, and allegorical compo&s;itions of tho&s;e more en|lightened Latin writers who flouri&s;hed in the middle ages, had their u&s;e, till better books came into vogue: pregnant as they were with ab&s;urdities, they communicated in&s;truc|tion on various and new &s;ubjects, enlarged the field of in|formation, and promoted the love of reading, by gratifying that growing literary curio&s;ity which now began to want materials for the exerci&s;e of its operations. How greatly our poets in general availed them&s;elves of the&s;e trea&s;ures, we may collect from this circum&s;tance only: even &s;uch writers as Chaucer and Lydgate, men of education and learning, when they tran&s;late a Latin author, appear to exe|cute their work through the medium of a French ver&s;ion. It is needle&s;s to pur&s;ue this hi&s;tory of French tran&s;lation any farther. I have given my rea&s;on for introducing it at all. In the next age, a great and univer&s;al revolution in literature en&s;ued; and the Engli&s;h them&s;elves began to turn their thoughts to tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>The&s;e French ver&s;ions enabled Caxton, our fir&s;t printer, to enrich the &s;tate of letters in this country with many valuable publications. He found it no difficult ta&s;k, either by him&s;elf, or the help of his friends, to turn a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e pieces into Engli&s;h, which he printed. Antient learning had as yet made too little progre&s;s among us, to encourage this enterpri&s;ing and indu&s;trious arti&s;t to publi&s;h the Roman autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s in their original language <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>It is, however, remarkable, that from the year 1471, in which Caxton began to print, down to the year 1540, during which period the Engli&s;h pre&s;s flouri&s;hed greatly under the conduct of many indu&s;trious, in|genious, and even learned arti&s;ts, only the very few following cla&s;&s;ics, &s;ome of which hardly de&s;erve that name, were printed in England.

A few Greek words, and abbreviatures, are here and there introduced.

The printer was Wynkyn de Worde; and the author complains, that he was obliged to omit his whole third part, becau&s;e the printer had no Hebrew types.

<P>With regard to the Poet laureate of the kings of England, an officer of the court remaining under that title to this day, he is undoubtedly the &s;ame that is &s;tyled the KING'S VER|SIFIER, and to whom one hundred &s;hillings were paid as his annual &s;tipend, in the year 1251 <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.

<P>Andrew Bernard, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively poet laureate of Henry the &s;eventh and the eighth, affords a &s;till &s;tronger proof that this officer was a Latin &s;cholar.

<P>I am of opinion, that it was not cu&s;tomary for the royal laureate to write in Engli&s;h, till the reformation of religion had begun to dimini&s;h the veneration for the Latin language: or rather, till the love of novelty, and a better &s;en&s;e of things, had bani&s;hed the narrow pedantries of mona&s;tic erudition, and taught us to cultivate our native tongue. In the mean time it is to be wi&s;hed, that another change might at lea&s;t be &s;uffered to take place in the execution of this in&s;titution, which is confe&s;&s;edly Gothic, and unaccommodated to modern manners. I mean, that the more than annual return of a compo&s;ition on a trite argument would be no longer re|quired. I am con&s;cious I &s;ay this at a time, when the be&s;t of kings affords the mo&s;t ju&s;t and copious theme for pane|gyric: but I &s;peak it at a time, when the department is honourably filled by a poet of ta&s;te and genius, which are idly wa&s;ted on the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ubjects, when impo&s;ed by con&s;traint, and perpetually repeated.</P>

Curio&s;ity was na|turally rai&s;ed to know from whence it came. At length, after much enquiry concerning the per&s;on who &s;ent this &s;ingular memoir to the news-paper, it was di&s;covered that he
<PB N="141" REF="147">
was a youth about &s;eventeen years old, who&s;e name was Chatterton; and who&s;e father had been &s;exton of Radcliffe church for many years, and al&s;o ma&s;ter of a writing-&s;chool in that pari&s;h, of which the church-wardens were tru&s;tees. The father however was now dead: and the &s;on was at fir&s;t unwilling to acknowledge, from whom, or by what means, he had procured &s;o valuable an original. But after many pro|mi&s;es, and &s;ome threats, he confe&s;&s;ed that he received a manu&s;cript on parchment containing the narrative above|mentioned, together with many other manu&s;cripts on parch|ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> from his father; who had found them in an iron che&s;t, the &s;ame that I have mentioned, placed in a room &s;ituated over the northern entrance of the church.</P>
<P>It appears that the father became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e manu|&s;cripts in the year 1748. For in that year, he was permit|ted, by the church-wardens of Radcliffe-church, to take from this che&s;t &s;everal written pieces of parchment, &s;up|po&s;ed to be illegible and u&s;ele&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of conver|ting them into covers for the writing-books of his &s;cholars. It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain, what, or how many, writings were de&s;troyed, in con&s;equence of this ab&s;urd and unwar|rantable indulgence. Our &s;chool-ma&s;ter, however, who&s;e accompli&s;hments were much above his &s;tation, and who was not totally de&s;titute of a ta&s;te for poetry, found, as it is &s;aid, in this immen&s;e heap of ob&s;olete manu&s;cripts, many poems written by Thomas Rowlie abovementioned, prie&s;t of Saint John's church in Bri&s;tol, and the confe&s;&s;or of al|derman Cannynge, which he carefully pre&s;erved. The&s;e at his death, of cour&s;e fell into the hands of his &s;on.</P>
<P>Of the extraordinary talents of this young man more will be &s;aid hereafter. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve at pre|&s;ent, that he &s;aw the merit and value of the&s;e poems, which he diligently tran&s;cribed. In the year 1770, he went to Lon|don, carrying with him the&s;e tran&s;cripts, and many originals, in hopes of turning &s;o in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;timable a trea&s;ure to his great

advantage. But from the&s;e flattering expectations, falling into a di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life, which ill &s;uited with his narrow circum&s;tances, and finding that a writer of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed ta&s;te and judgement, Mr. Walpole, had pronounced the poems to be &s;u&s;picious, in a fit of de&s;pair, ari&s;ing from di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;appointment, he de&s;troyed all his papers, and poi&s;oned him&s;elf. Some of the poems however, both tran|&s;cripts and originals, he had previou&s;ly &s;old, either to Mr. Catcott, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, or to Mr. Barrett, an emi|nent &s;urgeon of the &s;ame place, and an ingenious antiquary, with whom they now remain <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mr. Barrett, to whom I am greatly o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">iged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or his unre&s;erved and liberal infor|mation on this &s;ubject, is now engaged in writing the ANTIQUITIES of BRISTOL.</NOTE>. But it appears, that among the&s;e there were but very few of parchment: mo&s;t of the poems which they purcha&s;ed were copies in his own hand. He was always aver&s;e to give any di&s;tinct or &s;atisfactory account of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but from time to time, as his nece&s;&s;ities required, he produced copies of his originals, which were bought by the&s;e gentlemen. The originals, one or two only excepted, he cho&s;e to retain in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The chief of the&s;e poems are, The TRAGEDY of ELLA, The EXECUTION of &s;ir CHARLES BAWDWIN, ODE to ELLA, The BATTLE of HASTINGS, The TOURNAMENT, one or two DIALOGUES, and a De&s;cription of CANNYNGE'S FEAST.</P>
<P>The TRAGEDY OF ELLA has &s;ix characters; one of which is a lady, named Birtha. It has a chorus con&s;i&s;ting of min&s;trels, who&s;e &s;ongs are often introduced. Ella was go|vernor of the ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, and a pui&s;&s;ant champion again&s;t the Danes, about the year 920. The &s;tory &s;eems to be the poet's invention. The tragedy is opened with the following &s;oliloquy.</P>

Lydgate's an&s;wer on re|ceiving the ode, which certainly cannot be genuine, is beneath tran&s;cription. The writer, freely owning his inferiority, de|clares, that Rowlie rivals Chaucer and Turgotus, who both lived in <HI>Norman tymes.</HI> The latter, indeed, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be &s;aid to have flouri&s;hed in that era, for he died bi&s;hop of Saint Andrews in 1115. But he is oddly coupled with Chaucer in another re&s;pect, for he wrote only &s;ome Latin chronicles. Be&s;ides, Lydgate mu&s;t have been &s;ufficiently acquainted with Chau|cer's age; for he was living, and a young man, when Chaucer died. The writer al&s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntions Stone, the Carmelite, as living with Chaucer and Turgotus: where|as he was Lydgate's cotemporary. The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to that of the extreme and affected meanne&s;s of the compo&s;ition, evidently prove this little piece a forgery.</NOTE>. I will give this piece at length.</P>

<P>I am of opinion, that none of the&s;e pieces are genuine. The EXECUTION of SIR CHARLES BAUDWIN is now allowed to be modern, even by tho&s;e who maintain all the other poems to be antient <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It contains 98 &s;tanzas, and was printed at London, in the year 1772. 4to. I am told, that in the abovementioned che&s;t, belonging to Radcliffe-church, an antient Record was di&s;covered, containing the expences for Ed|ward the fourth to &s;ee the execution of &s;ir Charles Baldwin; with a de&s;cription of a canopy under which the king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ate at thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> execution. This Record &s;eems to have given ri&s;e to the poem. A bond which &s;ir Charles Baldwin gave to king Henry the &s;ixth, I &s;uppo&s;e about &s;eizing the earl of Warwick, is &s;aid to have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n mentioned in one of Rowlie's manu&s;cripts, called the YELLOW ROLL, perhaps the &s;ame, found in Cannynge's che&s;t, but now lo&s;t. See Stowe's CHRON. by Howes, edit. fol. 1615. p. 406. col. 2. And Speed's, p. 669. col. 2. edit. 1611.

And that he was <HI>mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> royally received.</HI> Ibid. p. 416. col. 2. Cannynge was then mayor of Bri&s;tol. Sir Charles Baldwin is &s;aid to have been exe|cuted at Bri&s;tol, in the pre&s;ence of Edward the fourth, in the year 1463. MS. Wantn. Bibl. Bodl. ut &s;upr. The &s;ame king was at Bri&s;tol, and lodged in &s;aint Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tine's abbey, in 1472, when he received a large gratuity from the citizens for carrying on the war again&s;t France. Wantner, ibid.</NOTE>. The ODE TO ELLA, and the EPIS|TLE to Lydgate, with his ANSWER, were written on one piece of parchment; and, as pretended, in Rowlie's own hand. This was &s;hewn to an ingenious critic and intelli|gent antiquary of my acquaintance; who a&s;&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> me, that the writing was a gro&s;s and palpable forgery. It was not even &s;kilfully counterfeited. The form of the letters, al|though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance, differed very e&s;&s;entially from every one of our early alpha|bets. Nor were the characters uniform and con&s;i&s;tent: part of the &s;ame manu&s;cript exhibiting &s;ome letters &s;haped
<PB N="154" REF="160">
according to the pre&s;ent round hand, while others were traced in imitation of the antient court and text hands. The parchment was old; and that it might look &s;till older, was &s;tained on the out&s;ide with ochre, which was ea&s;ily rubbed off with a linen cloth. Care had al&s;o been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow ca&s;t. To communi|cate a &s;tronger &s;tamp of rude antiquity, the ODE was writ|ten like pro&s;e: no di&s;tinction, or termination, being made between the &s;everal ver&s;es. Lydgate's ANSWER, which makes a part of this manu&s;cript, and is written by the &s;ame hand, I have already proved to be a manife&s;t impo&s;ition. This parchment has &s;ince been unfortunately lo&s;t <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">At the &s;ame time, another manu&s;cript on parchment, written, as pretended, by Rowlie, was &s;hewn to this gentleman: which, tallying in every re&s;pect with the ODE to ELLA, plainly appeared to be forged, in the &s;ame manner, and by the &s;ame modern hand. It was in pro&s;e; and contained an account of Saxon coins, and the ri&s;e of coining in England, with a li&s;t of coins, poems, antient in&s;criptions, mo|numents, and other curio&s;ities, in the ca|binet of Cannynge abovementioned. This parchment is al&s;o lo&s;t; and, I believe, no copy remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. I have my|&s;elf carefully examined the original manu&s;cript, as it is called, of the little piece entitled, ACCOUNTE OF W. CAN|NYNGE'S FEAST. It is likewi&s;e on parchment, and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that the writing betrays all the &s;u&s;picious &s;ig|natures which were ob&s;erved in that of the ODE TO ELLA. I have repeatedly and diligently compared it with three or four authentic manu&s;cripts of the time of Edward the fourth, to all which I have found it totally unlike. Among other &s;maller ve&s;tiges of forgery, which cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily de&s;cribed and explained here, at the bottom are added in ink two coats of arms, containing empalements of Cannynge and of his friends or relations, with family-names, appa|rently delineated by the &s;ame pen which wrote the ver&s;es. Even the &s;tyle and drawing of the armorial bearings di&s;co|ver the hand of a modern herald. This, I believe, is the only pretended original of the poetry of Rowlie, now remaining.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="161">
As to internal arguments, an unnatural affectation of antient &s;pelling and of ob&s;olete words, not belonging to the period a&s;&s;igned to the poems, &s;trikes us at fir&s;t &s;ight. Of the&s;e old words combinations are frequently formed, which never yet exi&s;ted in the unpoli&s;hed &s;tate of the Eng|li&s;h language: and &s;ometimes the antiquated diction is mo&s;t inartificially mi&s;applied, by an improper contexture with the pre&s;ent modes of &s;peech. The attentive reader will al&s;o di&s;cern, that our poet &s;ometimes forgets his a&s;&s;umed cha|racter, and does not always act his part with con&s;i&s;tency: for the chorus, or interlude, of the dam&s;el who drowns her&s;elf, which I have cited at length from the TRAGEDY of ELLA, is much more intelligible, and free from uncouth expre&s;&s;ions, than the general phra&s;eology of the&s;e compo&s;i|tions. In the BATTLE OF HASTINGS, &s;aid to be tran&s;lated from the Saxon, Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple. The battle of Ha&s;tings was fought in the year 1066. We will grant the Saxon original to have been written &s;oon afterwards: about which time, no other notion prevailed concerning this miraculous monument, than the &s;uppo&s;ition which had been delivered down by long and con&s;tant tradi|tion, that it was erected in memory of Hengi&s;t's ma&s;&s;acre. This was the e&s;tabli&s;hed and uniform opinion of the Wel&s;h and Armorican bards, who mo&s;t probably received it from the Saxon min&s;trels: and that this was the popular belief at the time of the battle of Ha&s;tings, appears from the evidence of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote his hi&s;tory not more than eighty years after that memorable event. And in this doctrine Robert of Glouce&s;ter and all the mon|ki&s;h chroniclers agree. That the Druids con&s;tructed this &s;tupendous pile for a place of wor&s;hip, was a di&s;covery re|&s;erved for the &s;agacity of a wi&s;er age, and the laborious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of modern antiquaries. In the EPISTLE to Lyd|gate, prefixed to the TRAGEDY, our poet condemns the ab&s;urdity and impropriety of the religious dramas, and recommends
<PB N="156" REF="162">
SOME GREAT STORY OF HUMAN MANNERS, as mo&s;t &s;uitable for theatrical repre&s;entation. But this idea is the re&s;ult of that ta&s;te and di&s;crimination, which could only belong to a more advanced period of &s;ociety <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>It would be tedious and trifling to de|&s;cend to minute particulars. But I will mention one or two. In the ODE TO ELLA, the poet &s;uppo&s;es, that the &s;pectre of Ella &s;ometimes appears in the <HI>myn&s;ter,</HI> that is Bri&s;tol-cathedral. But when Rowlie is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived, the pre&s;ent ca|thedral of Bri&s;tol was nothing more than an Augu&s;tine mona&s;tery, in which Henry the eighth e&s;tabli&s;hed long afterwards a bi|&s;hop, and a dean and chapter, in the year 1542. <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> is a word almo&s;t appro|priated to Cathedrals: and I will venture to &s;ay, that the church of this mona&s;tery, before the pre&s;ent foundation took place, never was called <HI>Bri&s;tol-min&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>The min|&s;ter.</HI> The inattention to this circum&s;tance, has produced another unfortunate anachro|ni&s;m in &s;ome of Rowlie's papers. Where, in his panegyric on Cannynge he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The favouryte of godde, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ryende of the chyrche, the companyonne of kynges, and the fadre of hys natyve CITIE, the grete and good Wyllyamme Canynge."</Q> Bri&s;tol was never &s;tyled a CITY till the erection of its bi&s;hoprick in 1542. See Willis's NOTIT. PARLIAMENT. p. 43. Lond. 1750. See al&s;o king Henry's Patent for creating the bi&s;hoprick of Bri&s;tol, in Ry|mer, dat. Jun. 4. A. D. 1542. An. reg. 34.

<P>The de&s;cription of Cannynge's fea&s;t, is called an ACCOUNTE of CANNYNGE'S FEAST. I do not think, that &s;o early as the year 1470, the word <HI>Accounte</HI> had lo&s;t its literal and original &s;en&s;e of a <HI>computus,</HI> or <HI>computation,</HI> and was u&s;ed in a loo&s;er acceptation for <HI>narrative</HI> or <HI>detail.</HI> Nor had it even then lo&s;t its true &s;pelling <HI>ac|compt,</HI> in which its proper and primary &s;ig|nification is pre&s;erved and implied.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, above all, the ca&s;t of thought, the complexion of the &s;entiments, and the &s;tructure of the compo&s;ition, evi|dently prove the&s;e pieces not antient. The ODE TO ELLA, for in&s;tance, has exactly the air of modern poetry; &s;uch, I mean, as is written at this day, only di&s;gui&s;ed with an|tique &s;pelling and phra&s;eology. That Rowlie was an ac|compli&s;hed literary character, a &s;cholar, an hi&s;torian, and an antiquarian, if contended for, I will not deny <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">He is al&s;o &s;aid to have been an emi|nent mechanic and mathematician. I am informed, that one of Rowlie's manu&s;cripts di&s;covered in Cannynge's iron che&s;t, was a plan for &s;upporting the tower of the Tem|ple-church in B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tol, which had greatly declined from its perpendicular. In a late reparation of that church, &s;ome &s;ubterra|neous works were found, minutely corre&s;|ponding with this manu&s;cript.</NOTE>. Nor is it impo&s;&s;ible that he might write Engli&s;h poetry. But that he is the writer of the poems which I have here cited, and
<PB N="157" REF="163">
which have been &s;o confidently a&s;cribed to him, I am not yet convinced.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the&s;e poem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> were compo&s;ed by the &s;on of the &s;chool-ma&s;ter before men|tioned; who inherited the ine&s;timable trea&s;ures of Cannynge's che&s;t in Radcliffe-church, as I have already related at large. This youth, who died at eighteen, was a prodigy of genius: and would have proved the fir&s;t of Engli&s;h poets, had he reached a maturer age. From his childhood, he was fond of reading and writing ver&s;es: and &s;ome of his early com|po&s;itions, which he wrote without any de&s;ign to deceive, have been judged to be mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing productions by the fir&s;t critic of the pre&s;ent age. From his &s;ituation and con|nections, he became a &s;kilful practitioner in various kinds of hand-writing. Availing him&s;elf therefore of his poetical talent, and his facility in the graphic art, to a mi&s;cellany of ob&s;cure and neglected parchments, which were commo|diou&s;ly placed in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he was tempted to add others of a more intere&s;ting nature, and &s;uch as he was enabled to forge, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, without the fear of detection. As to his knowledge of the old Engli&s;h literature, which is rarely the &s;tudy of a young poet, a &s;uf|ficient quantity of ob&s;olete words and phra&s;es were readily at|tainable from the glo&s;&s;ary to Chaucer, and to Percy's Ballads. It is confe&s;&s;ed, that this youth wrote the EXECUTION OF SIR CHARLES BAWDWIN: and he who could forge that poem, might ea&s;ily forge all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we will allow, that &s;ome pieces of poetry written by Rowlie might have been pre&s;erved in Cannynge's che&s;t: and that the&s;e were enlarged and improved by young Chatterton. But if this was the ca&s;e, they were &s;o much altered as to become entirely new compo&s;itions. The poem which bids the faire&s;t to be one of the&s;e originals is CANNYNGE'S FEAST. But the parchment-manu&s;cript of this little poem has already been proved to be a forgery. A circum&s;tance
<PB N="158" REF="164">
which is perhaps alone &s;ufficient to make us &s;u&s;pect that no originals ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>It will be a&s;ked, for what end or purpo&s;e did he contrive &s;uch an impo&s;ture? I an&s;wer, from lucrative views; or perhaps from the plea&s;ure of deceiving the world, a motive which, in many minds, operates more powerfully than the hopes of gain. He probably promi&s;ed him&s;elf greater emo|luments from this indirect mode of exerci&s;ing his abilities: or, he might have &s;acrificed even the vanity of appearing in the character of an applauded original author, to the private enjoyment of the &s;ucce&s;s of his invention and dexterity.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved above, that Cannynge ordered his iron che&s;t in Radcliffe-church to be &s;olemnly vi&s;ited once in every year, and that an annual entertainment &s;hould be provided for the vi&s;itors. In the notices relating to this matter, which &s;ome of the chief patrons of Rowlie's poetry hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lately &s;ent me from Bri&s;tol, it is affirmed, that this order is contained in Cannynge's will: and that he &s;pecifies therein, that not only his manu&s;cript evidences abovementioned, but that the POEMS of HIS CONFESSOR ROWLIE, which likewi&s;e he had depo&s;ited in the afore&s;aid iron che&s;t, were al&s;o to be &s;ubmitted to this annual in&s;pection. This circum&s;tance at fir&s;t &s;trongly inclined me to think favourably of the authen|ticity of the&s;e pieces. At lea&s;t it proved, that Rowlie had left &s;ome performances in ver&s;e.

<P>Our tran&s;lator in the&s;e ver&s;es formally declares his in|tention of giving his reader no entertainment; and di&s;avows all concern with &s;ecular vanities, e&s;pecially tho&s;e unedifying tales of love and arms, which were the cu&s;tomary themes of other poets, and the delight of an idle age. The romances of OCTAVIAN, &s;ir BEVIS, and &s;ir GUY, have already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at large.

<P>I know not whether this anecdote about Noah is in any &s;imilar &s;uppo&s;ititious book of Gene&s;is.

MSS. Harl. 2013. This alter|cation between Noah and his wife, takes up almo&s;t the whole third <HI>pageaunt</HI> of the&s;e interludes. Noah, having reproached his wife for her u&s;ual frowardne&s;s of temper, at la&s;t conjures her to come on board the ark, for fear of drowning. His wife in|&s;i&s;ts on his &s;ailing without her; and &s;wears by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;aint John,</HI> that &s;he will not embark, till &s;ome of her old female com|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nions are ready to go with her. She adds, that if he is in &s;uch a hurry, he may &s;ail alone, and fetch him&s;elf a new wife.

<P>Concerning legend-makers, there is a cu|rious &s;tory in MSS. James, xxxi. p. 6. [ad ITER LANCASTR. num. 39. vol. 40.] Bibl. Bodl. Gilbert de Stone, a learned eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who flouri&s;hed about the year 1380, was &s;oli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ed by the monks of Holywell in Flint&s;hire, to write the life of their patron &s;aint.

He has the character of an ele|gant Latin writer; and &s;eems to have done the &s;ame piece of &s;ervice, perhaps in the &s;ame way, to other religious hou&s;es. From his EPISTLES, it appears that he wrote the life of &s;aint <HI>Wolfade,</HI> patron of the priory of canons regular of his native town of Stone in Stafford&s;hire, which he dedicated to the prior, William de Madely. Epi&s;t. iii. dat. 1399. [MSS. Bibl. Bodl. Sup. D i. Art. 123.] He was Latin &s;ecretary to &s;e|veral bi&s;hops, and could po&s;&s;ibly write a legend or a letter with equal facility. His epi&s;tles are 123 in number. The fir&s;t of them, in which he is &s;tiled <HI>chancellour to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter,</HI> is to the archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury. That is, <HI>&s;ecretary.</HI> [MSS. Cotton. VITELL. E. x. 17.] This bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter mu&s;t have been Wil|liam of Wykeham.</P>

It is enti|tled, <HI>De</HI> MIRACULIS <HI>beati&s;&s;imi illius Militis Chri&s;ti, Henrici &s;exti, etc.</HI> That it might properly rank with other legends, it was tran&s;lated from an Engli&s;h copy into Latin, by one Johannes, &s;tyled <HI>Pauperculus,</HI> a monk, about the year 1503, at the command of John Morgan, dean of Wind&s;or, afterwards bi&s;hop of &s;aint David's. It is divided into two books: to both of which, prefaces are prefixed, containing proofs of the miracles wrought by this pious monarch.

As an hi&s;torian, our author is the dulle&s;t of compilers. He is equally attentive to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the mayors of London, and of the monarchs of England: and &s;eems to have thought the dinners at guildhall, and the pageantries of the city-companies, more intere&s;ting tran&s;actions, than our victories in France, and our &s;truggles for public liberty at home. One of Fabyan's hi&s;torical anecdotes, under the important reign of Henry the fifth, is, that a new weather|cock was placed on the cro&s;s of Saint Paul's &s;teeple. It is &s;aid, that cardinal Wol&s;ey commanded many copies of this chronicle to be committed to the flames, becau&s;e it made too ample a di&s;covery of the exce&s;&s;ive revenues of the clergy.

<P>Caxton, the celebrated printer, was likewi&s;e a poet; and be&s;ide the rhyming introductions and epilogues with which he frequently decorates his books, has left a poem of con|&s;iderable length, entitled the WORKE OF SAPIENCE <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Printed by him, without date. fol. in thirty-&s;even leaves.</NOTE>. It comprehends, not only an allegorical fiction concerning the two courts of the ca&s;tle of Sapience, in which there is no imagination, but a &s;y&s;tem of natural philo&s;ophy, grammar, logic, rhetoric, geometry, a&s;tronomy, theology, and other
<PB N="195" REF="201">
topics of the fa&s;hionable literature. Caxton appears to be the author, by the prologue: yet it is not improbable, that he might on this occa&s;ion employ &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed ver&s;ifier, at lea&s;t as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to prepare a new book of original poetry for his pre&s;s. The writer's de&s;ign, is to de&s;cribe the effects of wi&s;dom from the beginning of the world: and the work is a hi&s;tory of knowledge or learning. In a vi&s;ion, he meets the godde&s;s SAPIENCE in a delightful meadow; who conducts him to her ca&s;tle, or man&s;ion, and there di&s;plays all her miraculous operations. Caxton, in the poem, in|vokes the <HI>gylted godde&s;s</HI> and <HI>moo&s;t facundyous lady</HI> Clio, apolo|gi&s;es to tho&s;e <HI>makers</HI> who delight in <HI>termes gay,</HI> for the in|elegancies of language which as a foreigner he could not avoid, and mode&s;tly declares, that he neither means to rival or envy Gower and Chaucer.</P>

<P>In the eighth chapter of our KALENDER are de&s;cribed the &s;even vi&s;ions, or the puni&s;hments in hell of the &s;even deadly &s;ins, which Lazarus &s;aw between his death and re&s;urrection. The&s;e puni&s;hments are imagined with great &s;trength of fancy, and accompanied with wooden cuts boldly touched, and which the printer Wynkyn de Worde probably procured from &s;ome German engraver at the infancy of the art <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Compare the torments of Dante's hell.

The PROUD are bound by hooks of iron to va&s;t wheels, like mills, placed between craggy precipices, which are in|ce&s;&s;antly whirling with the mo&s;t violent impetuo&s;ity, and &s;ound like thunder. The ENVIOUS are plunged in a lake half frozen, from which as they attempt to emerge for ea&s;e, their naked limbs are in&s;tantly &s;mote with a bla&s;t of &s;uch intolerable keenne&s;s, that they are compelled to dive again into the lake. To the WRATHFULL is a&s;&s;igned a gloomy cavern, in which their bodies are butchered, and their limbs mangled
<PB N="198" REF="204">
by demons with various weapons. The SLOTHFULL are tormented in a <HI>horrible hall dark and tenebrous,</HI> &s;warming with innum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rable flying &s;erpents of various &s;hapes and &s;izes, which &s;ting to the heart. This, I think, is the Hell of the Gothic EDDA. The COVETOUS are dipped in cauldrons filled with boiling metals. The GLUTTONOUS are placed in a vale near a loath&s;ome pool, abounding with venomous creatures, on who&s;e banks tables are &s;pread, from which they are per|petually crammed with toads by devils. CONCUPISCENCE is puni&s;hed in a field full of immen&s;e pits or wells, overflowing with fire and &s;ulphur. This vi&s;ionary &s;cene of the infernal puni&s;hments &s;eems to be borrowed from a legend related by Matthew Paris, under the reign of king John: in which the &s;oul of one Thurkhill, a native of Tid&s;tude in E&s;&s;ex is con|veyed by &s;aint Julian from his body, when laid a&s;leep, into hell and heaven. In hell he has a &s;ight of the torments of the damned, which are pre&s;ented under the form and name of the INFERNAL PAGEANTS, and greatly re&s;emble the fictions I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed. Among the tormented, is a knight, who had pa&s;&s;ed his life in &s;hedding much innocent blood at tilts and tournaments. He is introduced, com|pleatly armed, on hor&s;eback; and couches his lance again&s;t the demon, who is commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;eize and to drag him to his eternal de&s;tiny. There is likewi&s;e a prie&s;t who never &s;aid ma&s;s, and a baron of the exchequer who took bribes. Tur|kill is then conducted into the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed, which are painted with &s;trong oriental colouring: and in Paradi&s;e, a garden repleni&s;hed with the mo&s;t delicious fruits, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite variety of trees, plants, and flowers, he &s;ees Adam, a per&s;onage of gigantic proportion, but the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ymmetry, reclined on the &s;ide of a fountain which &s;ent forth four &s;treams of different water and colour, and under the &s;hade of a tree of immen&s;e &s;ize and height, laden with fruits of every kind, and breathing the riche&s;t odours.

The walls of the hall were hung all over with &s;hields, among which was that of our king Richard the fir&s;t.

<P>The &s;tronge&s;t argument which induces me to give this poem to Hawes, and not to Lydgate, is, that it was printed in Hawes's life-time, with his name, by Wyn|kyn de Worde. Bale al&s;o mentions, among Hawes's poems, <HI>Templum Cry&s;tallinum</HI> in one book. There is, however, a no le&s;s &s;trong argument for giving it to Lydgate, and that is from Hawes him&s;elf; who, re|citing Lydgate's Works, in the PASTIME OF PLEASURE, &s;ays thus, [ch. xiv. edit. 1555.

<P>If the poems of Rowlie are not genuine, the PASTIME OF PLEASURE is almo&s;t the only effort of imagination and invention which had yet appeared in our poetry &s;ince Chau|cer. This poem contains no common touches of romantic and allegoric fiction. The per&s;onifications are often happily &s;u&s;tained, and indicate the writer's familiarity with the Pro|vencial &s;chool. The model of his ver&s;ification and phra&s;eo|logy is that improved harmony of numbers, and facility of diction, with which his predece&s;&s;or Lydgate adorned our octave &s;tanza.

This was natural at the beginning of the typographic art. Many of Chaucer's poems were now recently printed by Caxton.</P>
<P>With regard to Millorie's book, much, if not mo&s;t, of it, I believe, is taken from the great French romance of LANCELOT, tran&s;lated from Latin into French at the command of one of our Henrys, a me|trical Engli&s;h ver&s;ion of which is now in Benet library at Cambridge. [See a &s;pe|cimen in Mr. Naa&s;mith's curious catalogue, p. 54.] I have left it doubtful whether it was the third Henry who ordered this ro|mance to be tran&s;lated into Latin, vol. i. p. 115. But, be&s;ide the proofs there &s;ug|ge&s;ted, in favour of that hypothe&s;is, it ap|pears, that Henry the third paid great attention to the&s;e compo&s;itions, from the following curious anecdote ju&s;t publi&s;hed, which throws new light on that monarch's character.</P>
<P>Arnaud Daniel, a troubadour, highly celebrated by Dante and Petrarch, about the year 1240 made a voyage into England, where, in the court of king Henry the third, he met a min&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">, who challenged him at <HI>difficult rhymes.</HI> The challenge was accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, a con&s;iderable wager was laid, and the rival bards were &s;hut up in &s;eparate chambers of the palace. The king, who appears to have much intere&s;ted him|&s;elf in the di&s;pute, allowed them ten days for <HI>compo&s;ing,</HI> and five more for <HI>learning to &s;ing,</HI> their re&s;pective pieces: after which, each was to exhibit his performance in the pre&s;ence of his maje&s;ty. The third day, the Engli&s;h min&s;trel announced that he was ready. The troubadour declared he had not wrote a line; but that he had tried, and could not as yet put two words together. The following evening he over|heard the min&s;trel practi&s;ing his <HI>chan&s;on</HI> to him&s;elf. The next day he had the good fortune to hear the &s;ame again, and learned the air and words. At the day appointed they both appeared before the king. Ar|naud de&s;ired to &s;ing fir&s;t. The min&s;trel, in a fit of the greate&s;t &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, &s;uddenly cried out, <HI>C'e&s;t ma chan&s;on, This is</HI> MY SONG. The king &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible. The min&s;trel &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon it; and Arnaud, being clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, ingenuou&s;ly told the whole affair. The king was much entertained with this ad|venture; and ordering the wager to be withdrawn, loaded them with rich pre&s;ents. But he afterwards obliged Arnaud to give a <HI>chan&s;on</HI> of his own compo&s;ition. Millot, ut &s;upr. tom. ii. p. 491.</P>
<P>In the mean time I would not be under|&s;tood to deny, that Henry the &s;econd en|couraged the&s;e pieces; for it partly ap|pears, that Gualter Mapes, archdeacon of Oxford, tran&s;lated, from Latin into French, the popular romance of SAINT GRAAL, at the in&s;tance of Henry the &s;econd, to whom he was chaplain, about the year 1190. See MSS. Reg. 20 D. iii. a manu|&s;cript perhaps coeval with the tran&s;lator; and, if &s;o, the original copy pre&s;ented to the king. Mai&s;ter Benoit, or Benedict, a rhymer in French, was al&s;o patroni&s;ed by this monarch: at who&s;e command he com|piled a metrical Chronicle of the DUKES OF NORMANDY: in which are cited I&s;i|dore Hi&s;palen&s;is, Pliny, and &s;aint Au&s;tin.

<P>IT is not the plan of this work to comprehend the Scotch poetry.

<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is William Dunbar, a native of Salton in Ea&s;t Lothian, about the year 1470. His mo&s;t ce|lebrated poems are The THISTLE AND THE ROSE, and THE GOLDEN TERGE.</P>
<P>The THISTLE AND THE ROSE was occa&s;ioned by the mar|riage of James the fourth, king of Scotland, with Margaret Tudor, elde&s;t daughter of Henry the &s;eventh, king of England: an event, in which the whole future political &s;tate of both nations was vitally intere&s;ted, and which ultimately produced the union of the two crowns and kingdoms. It was fini&s;hed on the ninth day of May in the year 1503, nearly three months before the arrival of the queen in Scot|land: who&s;e progre&s;s from Richmond to Edinburgh was attended with a greater magnificence of parade, proce&s;&s;ions, and &s;pectacles, than I ever remember to have &s;een on any &s;imilar occa&s;ion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See a memoir, cited above, in Leland's COLL. tom. iii. APPEND. edit. 1770. p. 265. It is worthy of particular notice, that during this expedition there was in the magnificent &s;uite of the prince&s;s a company of players, under the direction of one John Ingli&s;h, who is &s;ometimes called Johannes. <Q REND="inline">"Amonge the &s;aide lordes and the qweene was in order, Johannes and his com|panye, the men&s;trells of mu&s;icke, &amp;c."</Q> p 267.

Afterwards the ceremonies of this &s;tately marriage are de&s;cribed; which yet is not equal, in magnificence and expence, to that of Richard the &s;econd with I&s;abell of France, at Calais, in the year 1397. This la&s;t-mentioned marriage is recorded with the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances, the dre&s;&s;es of the king and the new queen, the names of the French and Engli&s;h nobility who at|tended, the pre&s;ents, one of which is a golden cup &s;tudded with jewels, and worth three thou&s;and pounds, given on both &s;ides, the banquets, entertainments, and a variety of other curious particulars, in five large vellum pages, in an antient Regi&s;ter of Merton priory in Surrey, in old French.

The poet replies, that the &s;pring of the pre&s;ent year was un|promi&s;ing and ungenial; unattended with the u&s;ual &s;ong of birds, and &s;erenity of &s;ky: and that &s;torms and &s;howers, and the loud bla&s;ts of the horn of <HI>lord</HI> Eolus, had u&s;urped her mild dominion, and hitherto prevented him from wandering at lei&s;ure under the vernal branches. MAY rejects his ex|cu&s;e, and with a &s;mile of maje&s;ty commands him to ari&s;e, and to perform his annual homage to the flowers, the birds, and the &s;un.

<P>This is an elegant and ingenious mode of blazoning the Scotti&s;h arms, which are a lion with a border, or tre&s;&s;ure, adorned with flower de luces.

NATURE lifting up his <HI>cluvis cleir,</HI> or &s;hining claws, and &s;uffering him to re&s;t on her knee, crowns him with a radiant diadem of precious &s;tones, and creates him the king of bea&s;ts: at the &s;ame time &s;he injoins him to exerci&s;e ju&s;|tice with mercy, and not to &s;uffer his &s;ubjects of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize or degree, to be oppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e of &s;uperiour &s;trength and dignity.

<PB N="264" REF="270">
She crowns the ro&s;e with <HI>clarefied</HI> gems, the lu&s;tre of which illumines all the land. The ro&s;e is hailed queen by the flowers. La&s;t, her prai&s;es are &s;ung by the univer&s;al chorus of birds, the &s;ound of which awakens the poet from his de|lightful dream. The fairy &s;cene is vani&s;hed, and he calls to the mu&s;e to perpetuate in ver&s;e the wonders of the &s;plendid vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Although much fine invention and &s;ublime fabling are di&s;played in the allegorical vi&s;ions of our old poets, yet this mode of compo&s;ition, by dealing only in imaginary per|&s;onages, and by excluding real characters and human actions, nece&s;&s;arily fails in that chief &s;ource of entertainment which we &s;eek in antient poetry, the repre&s;entation of antient manners.</P>
<P>Another general ob&s;ervation, immediately re&s;ulting from the &s;ubject of this poem, may be here added, which illu&s;|trates the pre&s;ent and future &s;tate of the Scotch poetry. The marriage of a prince&s;s of England with a king of Scotland, from the new communication and intercour&s;e opened between the two courts and kingdoms by &s;uch a connection, mu&s;t have greatly contributed to poli&s;h the rude manners, and to improve the language, literature, and arts, of Scotland.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of Dunbar's GOLDEN TERGE, is to &s;hew the gradual and imperceptible influence of love, when too far indulged, over rea&s;on. The di&s;cerning reader will ob&s;erve, that the ca&s;t of this poem is tinctured with the morality and imagery of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, and the FLOURE AND LEAFE, of Chaucer.</P>
<P>The poet walks forth at the dawn of a bright day. The effects of the ri&s;ing &s;un on a vernal land&s;cape, with its ac|companiments, are thus delineated in the manner of Lyd|gate, yet with more &s;trength, di&s;tinctne&s;s, and exuberance of ornament.</P>

<P>At length PRESENCE, by whom the poet under&s;tands that irre&s;i&s;tible incentive accruing to the pa&s;&s;ion of love by &s;ociety, by being often admitted to the company of the beloved object, throws a magical powder into the eyes of REASON; who is &s;uddenly deprived of all his powers, and reels like a drunken man. Immediately the poet receives a deadly wound, and is taken pri&s;oner by BEAUTY; who now a&s;&s;umes a more engaging air, as the clear eye of REASON is growing dim by intoxication. DISSIMULATION then tries all her arts on the poet: FAIR CALLING &s;miles upon him: CHERISHING &s;ooths him with &s;oft &s;peeches: NEW ACQUAINTANCE embraces him awhile, but &s;oon takes her leave, and is never &s;een afterwards.

Dunbar is not le&s;s &s;uited to &s;atirical than to &s;ublime allegory: and that he is the fir&s;t poet who has appeared with any de|gree of &s;pirit in this way of writing &s;ince Pierce Plowman. His THISTLE AND ROSE, and GOLDEN TERGE, are generally and ju&s;tly mentioned as his capital works: but the natural complexion of his genius is of the moral and didactic ca&s;t. The mea&s;ure of this poem is partly that of Sir THOPAS in Chaucer: and hence we may gather by the way, that Sir THOPAS was antiently viewed in the light of a ludicrous compo&s;ition. It is certain that the pageants and interludes of Dunbar's age mu&s;t have quickened his invention to form tho&s;e grote&s;que groupes. The exhibition of MORALITIES was now in high vogue among the Scotch. A Morality was played at the marriage of James the fourth and the prince&s;s Margaret <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">MEMOIR, ut &s;upr. p. 300.</NOTE>.

<P>ANother of the di&s;tingui&s;hed luminaries, that marked the re&s;toration of letters in Scotland at the commence|ment of the &s;ixteenth century, not only by a general emi|nence in elegant erudition, but by a cultivation of the ver|nacular poetry of his country, is Gawen Dougla&s;s. He was de&s;cended from a noble family, and born in the year 1475 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hume, HIST. DOUGL. p. 219.</NOTE>. According to the practice of that age, e&s;pecially in Scotland, his education perhaps commenced in a grammar-&s;chool of one of the mona&s;teries: there is undoubted proof, that it was fini&s;hed at the univer&s;ity of Paris. It is probable, as he was intended for the &s;acred function, that he was &s;ent to Paris for the purpo&s;e of &s;tudying the canon law: in con&s;equence of a decree promulged by James the fir&s;t, which tended in &s;ome degree to reform the illiteracy of the clergy, as it in|joined, that no eccle&s;ia&s;tic of Scotland &s;hould be preferred to a prebend of any value without a competent &s;kill in that &s;cience <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Le&s;l.

Among other high promotions in the church, which his very &s;ingular accompli&s;hments obtained, he was provo&s;t of the collegiate church of &s;aint Giles at Edinburgh, abbot of the opulent convent of Abberbrothrock, and bi|&s;hop of Dunkeld. He appears al&s;o to have been nominated by the queen regent to the archbi&s;hoprick, either of Gla&s;|gow, or of &s;aint Andrew's: but the appointment was re|pudiated by the pope <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thynne, CONTINUAT.

<P>The poetical beauties of this &s;pecimen will be reli&s;hed by every reader who is fond of lively touches of fancy, and rural imagery. But the ver&s;es will have another merit with tho&s;e critics who love to contemplate the progre&s;s of com|po&s;ition, and to mark the original workings of genuine na|ture; as they are the effu&s;ion of a mind not overlaid by the de&s;criptions of other poets, but operating, by its own force and bias, in the delineation of a vernal land&s;cape, on &s;uch objects as really occurred. On this account, they de&s;erve to be better under&s;tood: and I have therefore tran&s;lated them into plain modern Engli&s;h pro&s;e. In the mean time, this experiment will &s;erve to prove their native excellence.

The new lu&s;tre, enlightening all the land, beamed on the &s;mall pebbles on the &s;ides of rivers, and on the &s;trands, which looked like beryl: while the reflection of the rays played on the banks in variegated gleams; and Flora threw forth her blooms und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r the feet of the &s;un's brilliant hor&s;es.

Towers, turrets, battlements, and high pinnacles, of churches, ca&s;tles, and every fair city, &s;eemed to be painted; and, together with every ba&s;tion and &s;tory, ex|pre&s;&s;ed their own &s;hape on the plains.

<P>The poet then &s;uppo&s;es, that REMEMBRANCE conducts him back to the cave on the &s;ea-&s;hore, in which he fell a&s;leep. He is awakened by a &s;hip firing a broad&s;ide <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>They &s;pared not the powder nor the <HI>&s;tones.</HI></L></Q>

Compare Buchanan, HIST. lib. xiv. ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in.</NOTE>. It was in this reign, that the nobility of Scotland began to frequent the court; which &s;oon became the theatre of all tho&s;e idle amu&s;ements which were calcu|lated to &s;olicit the attention of a young king. All the&s;e abu&s;es are painted in this poem with an hone&s;t unre&s;erved indignation. It mu&s;t not in the mean time be forgotten, that James po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed eminent abilities, and a love of litera|ture: nor is it be&s;ide our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that he was the author of the celebrated ballad called CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Printed at Oxford, by Edm.

<P>The COMPLAYNT OF THE PAPINGO is a piece of the like tendency. In the Prologue, there is a curious and critical catalogue of the Scotch poets who flouri&s;hed about the four|teenth, fifteenth, and &s;ixteenth centuries. As the names and works of many of them &s;eem to be totally forgotten, and as it may contribute to throw &s;ome new lights on the neglected hi&s;tory of the Scotch poetry, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to give the pa&s;&s;age at large, with a few illu&s;trations. Our author declares, that the poets of his own age dare not a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of the three Engli&s;h poets, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate. He then, under the &s;ame idea, makes a tran&s;ition to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed poets, who formerly flouri&s;hed in Scotland.</P>

<P>The Scotch, from that philo&s;ophical and &s;peculative ca&s;t which characteri&s;es their national genius, were more zealous and early friends to a reformation of religion than their neighbours in England. The pomp and elegance of the ca|tholic wor&s;hip made no impre&s;&s;ion on a people, who&s;e de|votion &s;ought only for &s;olid edification; and who had no notion that the interpo&s;ition of the &s;en&s;es could with any propriety be admitted to cooperate in an exerci&s;e of &s;uch a nature, which appealed to rea&s;on alone, and &s;eemed to ex|clude all aids of the imagination. It was natural that &s;uch a people, in their &s;y&s;tem of &s;piritual refinement, &s;hould warmly prefer the &s;evere and rigid plan of Calvin: and it is from this principle, that we find mo&s;t of their writers, at the re&s;toration of learning, taking all occa&s;ions of cen&s;uring
<PB N="322" REF="328">
the ab&s;urdities of popery with an unu&s;ual degree of ab|horrence and a&s;perity.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the poem before us, an allegory on the corruptions of the church is introduced, not de&s;titute of in|vention, humour, and elegance: but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe, who not con&s;idering religion as reduced to a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, and becau&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were poor, imagined that &s;ecular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>In the primitive and pure ages of chri&s;tianity, the poet &s;uppo&s;es, that the Church married Poverty, who&s;e children were Cha&s;tity and Devotion. The emperour Con&s;tantine &s;oon afterwards divorced this &s;ober and decent couple; and without obtaining or a&s;king a di&s;pen&s;ation, married the Church with great &s;olemnity to Property. Pope Silve&s;ter ratified the marriage: and Devotion retired to a hermitage. They had two daughters, Riches and Sen&s;uality; who were very beautiful, and &s;oon attracted &s;uch great and univer&s;al regard, that they acquired the chief a&s;cendancy in all &s;piri|tual affairs. Such was the influence of Sen&s;uality in parti|cular, that Cha&s;tity, the daughter of the Church by Poverty, was exiled: &s;he tried, but in vain, to gain protection in Italy and France. Her &s;ucce&s;s was equally bad in England. She &s;trove to take refuge in the court of Scotland: but they drove her from the court to the clergy. The bi&s;hops were alarmed at her appearance, and prote&s;ted they would harbour no rebel to the See of Rome. They &s;ent her to the nuns, who received her in form, with proce&s;&s;ions and other honours. But news being immediately di&s;patched to Sen&s;uality and Riches, of her friendly reception among the nuns, &s;he was again compelled to turn fugitive. She next fled to the mendi|cant friers, who declared they could not take charge of ladies. At la&s;t &s;he was found &s;ecreted in the nunnery of the Burrow|moor near Edinburgh, where &s;he had met her mother Po|verty and her &s;i&s;ter Devotion. Sen&s;uality attempts to be&s;iege

<P>Other parts of Europe, from the &s;ame &s;ituations in life, afford in&s;tances of the &s;ame practice. Froi&s;&s;art has left a long narrative of an eminent robber, one Amergot Marcell; who became at length &s;o formidable and powerful, as to claim a place in the hi&s;tory of France. About the year 1380, he had occupied a &s;trong ca&s;tle for the &s;pace of ten years, in the province of Auvergne, in which he lived with the &s;plendor and dominion of a petty &s;overeign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> having ama&s;&s;ed, by pillaging the neighbouring country, one hun|dred thou&s;and francs. His depredations brought in an annual revenue of twenty thou&s;and floreins. Afterwards he
<PB N="333" REF="339">
is tempted imprudently to &s;ell his ca&s;tle to one of the gene|rals of the king for a con&s;iderable &s;um. Froi&s;&s;art introduces Marcell, after having &s;old his fortre&s;s, uttering the following lamentation, which &s;trongly paints his &s;y&s;tem of depredation, the feudal anarchy, and the trade and travelling of tho&s;e days. <Q REND="inline">"What a joy was it when we rode forthe at adventure, and &s;omtyme found by the way a ryche priour, or mar|chaunt, or a route of mulettes, of Montpellyer, of Nar|bone, of Lymons, of Fongans, of Tholous, or of Car|ca&s;&s;one, laden with clothe of Bru&s;&s;elles, or peltre ware comynge from the fayres, or laden with &s;pycery from Bruges, from Damas, or from Aly&s;aunder!

<P>But on the whole I am inclined to think, that our te&s;tator Makgregor, although a robber, was a per&s;onage of high rank, who&s;e power and authority were &s;uch, as to require this in|direct and artificial mode of abu&s;e. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I believe the name to be fictitious.</P>

I take this opportunity of ob&s;erving, that the old Scotch poet Blind Harry belongs to this period; and, at the &s;ame time, of correcting the mi&s;take, which, in conformity to the common opinion, and on the evidence of Demp&s;ter and Mackenzie, I have committed, in placing him towards the clo&s;e of the fourteenth century <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. i. p. 321.

<P>I cannot return to the Engli&s;h poets without a hint, that a well-executed hi&s;tory of the Scotch poetry from the thirteenth century, would be a valuable acce&s;&s;ion to the general literary hi&s;tory of Britain. The &s;ubject is pregnant with much curious and in&s;tructive information, is highly de&s;erving of a minute and regular re&s;earch, has never yet been uniformly examined in its full extent, and the materials are both acce&s;&s;ible and ample.

have never yet been written with tolerable care; and at pre&s;ent are only known from the meagre outlines of Demp&s;ter and Mackenzie.

<P>Skelton was patroni&s;ed by Henry Algernoon Percy, the fifth earl of Northumberland, who de&s;erves particular notice here; as he loved literature at a time when many of the nobility of England could hardly read or write their names, and was the general patron of &s;uch genius as his age pro|duced. He encouraged Skelton, almo&s;t the only profe&s;&s;ed poet of the reign of Henry the &s;eventh, to write an elegy on the death of his father, which is yet extant. But &s;till &s;tronger proofs of his literary turn, e&s;pecially of his &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ion for poetry, may be collected from a very &s;plendid manu&s;cript, which formerly belonged to this very di&s;tin|gui&s;hed peer, and is at pre&s;ent pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu|&s;eum <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">MSS.

The pieces are chiefly tho&s;e of Lydgate, after which follow the afore&s;aid Elegy of Skelton, and &s;ome &s;maller compo&s;i|tions. Among the latter are a metrical hi&s;tory of the family of Percy, pre&s;ented to him by one of his own chaplains; and a prolix &s;eries of poetical in&s;criptions, which he cau&s;ed to be written on the walls and ceilings of the principal apartments of his ca&s;tles of Lekinfield and Wre&s;&s;il <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>See &s;upr. p. 126.

<P>It is in vain to apologi&s;e for the coar&s;ene&s;s, ob&s;cenity, and &s;currility of Skelton, by &s;aying that his poetry is tinctured with the manners of his age. Skelton would have been a writer without decorum at any period. The manners of Chaucer's age were undoubtedly more rough and unpoli&s;hed than tho&s;e of the reign of Henry the &s;eventh. Yet Chaucer, a poet abounding in humour, and often employed in de&s;crib|ing the vices and follies of the world, writes with a degree of delicacy, when compared with Skelton. That Skelton's manner is gro&s;s and illiberal, was the opinion of his cotem|poraries; at lea&s;t of tho&s;e critics who lived but a few years afterwards, and while his poems yet continued in vogue. Puttenham, the author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, publi&s;hed in the year 1589, &s;peaking of the &s;pecies of &s;hort metre u&s;ed in the min&s;trel-romances, for the convenience of being &s;ung to the harp at fea&s;ts, and in CAROLS and ROUNDS, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;uch other light or la&s;civious poems which are com|monly more commodiou&s;ly uttered by tho&s;e buffoons or Vices in playes than by any other per&s;on,"</Q> and in which the &s;udden return of the rhyme fatigues the ear, immediately &s;ubjoins: <Q REND="inline">"Such were the rimes of Skelton, being indeed but a rude rayling rimer, and all his doings ridiculous; he u&s;ed both &s;hort di&s;taunces and &s;hort mea&s;ures, plea&s;ing only the popular care <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii. ch. ix. p. 69.</NOTE>."</Q> And Meres, in his PALLADIS

<P>From a want of the notions of common propriety and decorum, it is amazing to &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">trange ab&s;urdities committed by the clergy of the middle ages, in adopting the laical character. Du Cange &s;ays, that the deans of many cathedrals in France en|tered on the dignities habited in a &s;urplice, girt with a &s;word, in boots and gilt &s;purs, and a hawk on the fi&s;t. LATIN. GLOSS. V. DECANUS, tom. i. p. 1326. See al&s;o ibid. p. 79. And tom. ii. p. 179. &s;eq.

And the lord of Sa&s;&s;ay held &s;ome of his lands, by placing a hawk on the high altar of the church of Evreux, while his pari&s;h prie&s;t celebrated the &s;ervice, booted and &s;purred, to the beat of drum, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tead of the organ.

Although their ideas of the dignity of the church were &s;o high, yet we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ind them &s;ometimes conferring the rank and title of &s;ecular nobility even on the Saints.

<P>IN a work of this general and comprehen&s;ive nature, in which the fluctuations of genius are &s;urveyed, and the dawnings or declen&s;ions of ta&s;te mu&s;t alike be noticed, it is impo&s;&s;ible that every part of the &s;ubject can prove equally &s;plendid and intere&s;ting.

<P>About the eighth century, trade was principally carried on by means of fairs, which la&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">everal days. Charle|magne e&s;tabli&s;hed many great marts of this &s;ort in France; as did William the conqueror, and his Norman &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in

England <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. i. p. 279.</NOTE>. The merchants, who frequented the&s;e fairs in numerous caravans or companies, employed every art to draw the people together. They were therefore accompanied by juglers, min&s;trels, and buffoons; who were no le&s;s in|tere&s;ted in giving their attendance, and exerting all their &s;kill, on the&s;e occa&s;ions. As now but few large towns ex|i&s;ted, no public &s;pectacles or popular amu&s;ements were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and as the &s;edentary plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life and private &s;ociety were yet unknown, the fair-time was the &s;ea&s;on for diver&s;ion. In proportion as the&s;e &s;hews were at|tended and encouraged, they began to be &s;et off with new decorations and improvements: and the arts of buffoonery being rendered &s;till more attractive by extending their circle of exhibition, acquired an importance in the eyes of the people. By degrees the clergy, ob&s;erving that the entertain|ments of dancing, mu&s;ic, and mimicry, exhibited at the&s;e protracted annual celebrities, made the people le&s;s religious, by promoting idlene&s;s and a love of fe&s;tivity, pro&s;cribed the&s;e &s;ports, and excommunicated the performers. But find|ing that no regard was paid to their cen&s;ures, they changed their plan, and determined to take the&s;e recreations into their own hands.

<P>Voltaire's theory on this &s;ubject is al&s;o very ingenious, and quite new. Religious plays, he &s;uppo&s;es, came originally from Con&s;tantinople; where the old Grecian &s;tage continued to flouri&s;h in &s;ome degree, and the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides were repre&s;ented, till the fourth century. About that period, Gregory Nazianzen, an archbi&s;hop, a poet, and one of the fathers of the church, bani&s;hed pagan plays from the &s;tage at Con&s;tantinople, and introduced &s;elect &s;tories from the old and new Te&s;tament. As the antient Greek tragedy was a religious &s;pectacle, a tran&s;ition was made on the &s;ame plan; and the choru&s;&s;es were turned into Chri&s;tian hymns <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Gregory wrote many &s;acred dramas for this purpo&s;e, which have not &s;urvived tho&s;e inimitable com|po&s;itions over which they triumphed for a time: one, how|ever, his tragedy called <GAP DESC="foreign">, or CHRIST'S PASSION, is &s;till extant <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">OP.

&s;piritual dramas, in which at fir&s;t a due degree of method and decorum was pre&s;erved, was at length adopted from Con&s;tantinople by the Italians; who framed, in the depth of the dark ages, on this foundation, that barbarous &s;pecies of theatrical repre&s;entation called MYSTERIES, or &s;acred come|dies, and which were &s;oon afterwards received in France <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

This opinion will acquire probability, if we con&s;ider the early commercial intercou&s;e between Italy and Con|&s;tantinople: and although the Italians, at the time when they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have imported plays of this nature, did not under&s;tand the Greek language, yet they could un|der&s;tand, and con&s;equently could imitate, what they &s;aw.</P>
<P>In defence of Voltaire's hypothe&s;is it may be further ob&s;erved, that the FEAST OF FOOLS and of the Ass, with other religious farces of that &s;ort, &s;o common in Europe, originated at Con&s;tantinople. They were in&s;tituted, although perhaps under other names, in the Greek church, about the year 990, by Theophylact, patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, pro|bably with a better de&s;ign than is imagined by the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical annali&s;ts; that of weaning the minds of the people from the pagan ceremonies, particularly the Bacchanalian and calendary &s;olemnities, by the &s;ub&s;titution of chri&s;tian &s;pectacles, partaking of the &s;ame &s;pirit of licentiou&s;ne&s;s.

The queen's ob&s;ervations on the per&s;ons of the la&s;t men|tioned piece, de&s;erve notice: as they are at once a curious picture of the romantic pedantry of the times, and of the characteri&s;tical turn and predominant propen&s;ities of the queen's mind. When the play was over, &s;he &s;ummoned the poet into her pre&s;ence, whom &s;he loaded with thanks and compliments: and at the &s;ame time turning to her levee, remarked, that Palamon was &s;o ju&s;tly drawn as a lover, that he certainly mu&s;t have been in love indeed: that Arcite was a <HI>right martial knight, having a &s;wart and manly countenance,</HI> yet with the a&s;pect of a Venus clad in armour: that the lovely Emilia was a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unblemi&s;hed &s;implicity, and that although &s;he &s;ung &s;o &s;weetly, and ga|thered flowers alone in the garden, &s;he pre&s;erved her cha&s;tity undeflowered.

<P>In tracing the hi&s;tory of our &s;tage, this early practice of performing plays in &s;chools and univer&s;ities has never been con&s;idered, as a circum&s;tance in&s;trumental to the growth and improvement of the drama. While the people were amu&s;ed with Skelton's TRIAL OF SIMONY, Bale's GOD'S PROMISES, and CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL, the &s;cholars of the times were compo&s;ing and acting plays on hi&s;torical &s;ubjects, and in imitation of Plautus and Terence. Hence ideas of a legitimate fable mu&s;t have been imperceptibly derived to the popular and vernacular drama. And we may add, while no &s;ettled or public theatres were known, and plays were chiefly acted by itinerant min&s;trels in the halls of the nobility at Chri&s;tmas, the&s;e literary &s;ocieties &s;upported &s;ome idea of a
<PB N="389" REF="395">
&s;tage: they afforded the be&s;t accommodations for theatrical exhibition, and were almo&s;t the only, certainly the mo&s;t rational, companies of players that exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>But I mean yet to tre&s;pa&s;s on my reader's patience, by pur|&s;uing this inquiry &s;till further; which, for the &s;ake of com|prehen&s;ion and connection, has already exceeded the limits of a digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is perhaps on this principle, that we are to account for plays being acted by &s;inging-boys: although they perhaps acquired a turn for theatrical repre&s;entation and the &s;pecta|cular arts, from their annual exhibition of the ceremonies of the boy-bi&s;hop; which &s;eem to have been common in almo&s;t every religious community that was capable of &s;up|porting a choir <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>In a &s;mall college, for only one provo&s;t, five fellows, and &s;ix chori&s;ters, founded by archbi&s;hop Rotheram in 1481, in the ob&s;cure village of Rotheram in York&s;hire, this piece of mummery was not omitted.

<P>To this eccle&s;ia&s;tical origin of the drama, we mu&s;t refer the plays acted by the &s;ociety of the pari&s;h-clerks of London,
<PB N="396" REF="402">
for eight days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, at Clerkenwell, which thenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> took its name, in the pre&s;ence of mo&s;t of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom, in the years 1390, and 1409. In the ignorant ages, the pari&s;h-clerks of London might ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a literary &s;ociety. It was an e&s;&s;ential part of their profe&s;&s;ion, not only to &s;ing but to read; an accom|pli&s;hment almo&s;t &s;olely confined to the clergy: and, on the whole, they &s;eem to come under the character of a religious fraternity. They were incorporated into a guild, or fellow|&s;hip, by king Henry the third about the year 1240, under the patronage of &s;aint Nicholas. It was antiently cu&s;tomary for men and women of the fir&s;t quality, eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and others, who were lovers of church-mu&s;ic, to be admitted into this corporation: and they gave large gratuities for the &s;upport, or education, of many per&s;ons in the practice of that &s;cience. Their public fea&s;ts, which I have already mentioned, were frequent, and celebrated with &s;inging and mu&s;ic; mo&s;t commonly at Guildhall chapel or college <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Stowe's SURV. LOND. ut &s;upr. lib. v. p. 231.</NOTE>. Be|fore the reformation, this &s;ociety was con&s;tantly hired to a&s;&s;i&s;t as a choir, at the magnificent funerals of the nobility, or other di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages, which were celebrated within the city of London, or in its neighbourhood. The &s;plendid ceremonies of their anniver&s;ary proce&s;&s;ion and ma&s;s, in the year 1554, are thus related by Strype, from an old chronicle. <Q REND="inline">"May the &s;ixth, was a goodly even&s;ong at Guild|hall college, by the Ma&s;ters of the CLARKS and their Fel|low&s;hip, with &s;inging and playing; and the morrow after, was a great ma&s;s, at the &s;ame place, and by the &s;ame fraternity: when every clark offered an halfpenny. The ma&s;s was &s;ung by diver&s;e of the queen's [Mary's] chapel and children. And after ma&s;s done, every clark went their proce&s;&s;ion, two and two together; each having on, a &s;ur|plice and a rich cope, and a garland. And then, four&s;core
<PB N="397" REF="403">
&s;tandards, &s;treamers, and banners; and each one that bare them had an albe or a &s;urplice. Then came in order the waits playing: and then, thirty clarkes, &s;ing|ing FESTA DIES.

<P>Before I conclude this inquiry, a great part of which has been taken up in endeavouring to &s;hew the connection be|tween places of education and the &s;tage, it ought to be re|marked, that the antient fa&s;hion of acting plays in the inns of court, which may be ranked among &s;eminaries of in|&s;truction, although for a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion, is deducible from this &s;ource.

<P>After the Re&s;toration, when the dignity of the old monarchical manners had &s;uffered a long eclip&s;e from a Calvini&s;tic u&s;urpa|tion, a feeble effort was made to revive the&s;e liberal and elegant amu&s;ements at Whitehall. For about the year 1675, queen Catharine ordered Crowne to write a Pa&s;toral called CALISTO, which was act|ed at court by the ladies Mary and Anne daughters of the duke of York, and the young nobility. About the &s;ame time lady Anne, afterwards queen, plaid the part of Semandra, in Lee's MITHRIDATES.

<P>In prai&s;e of this &s;ong it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that it re|minds us of &s;ome favorite touches in Milton's COMUS, to which it perhaps gave birth.

<P>WE are now arrived at the commencement of the &s;ix|teenth century. But before I proceed to a formal and particular examination of the poetry of that century, and of tho&s;e that follow, &s;ome preliminary con&s;iderations of a more general nature, and which will have a reference to all the remaining part of our hi&s;tory, for the purpo&s;e of preparing the reader, and facilitating our future inquiries, appear to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On a retro&s;pect of the fifteenth century, we find much poetry written during the latter part of that period. It is certain, that the recent introduction into England of the art of typography, to which our countrymen afforded the mo&s;t liberal encouragement, and which for many years was almo&s;t &s;olely confined to the impre&s;&s;ion of Engli&s;h books, the fa&s;hion of tran&s;lating the cla&s;&s;ics from French ver&s;ions, the growing improvements of the Engli&s;h language, and the diffu&s;ion of learning among the laity, greatly contributed to multiply Engli&s;h compo&s;ition, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e. The&s;e cau&s;es, however, were yet immature; nor had they gathered a &s;ufficient degree of power and &s;tability, to ope|rate on our literature with any vigorous effects.</P>
<P>But there is a circum&s;tance, which, among &s;ome others already &s;ugge&s;ted, impeded that progre&s;&s;ion in our poetry, which might yet have been expected under all the&s;e advan|tages. A revolution, the mo&s;t fortunate and important in mo&s;t other re&s;pects, and the mo&s;t intere&s;ting that occur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the hi&s;tory of the migration of letters, now began to take place; which, by diverting the attention of ingenious men to new modes of thinking, and the culture of new lan|guages, introduced a new cour&s;e of &s;tudy, and gave a temporary
<PB N="408" REF="414">
check to vernacular compo&s;ition. This was the re|vival of cla&s;&s;ical learning.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e annals we mu&s;t have frequently re|marked, from time to time, &s;triking &s;ymptoms of a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition in the human mind to rou&s;e from its lethargic &s;tate, and to break the bonds of barbari&s;m. After many imperfect and interrupted efforts, this mighty deliverance, in which the mouldering Gothic fabrics of fal&s;e religion and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy fell together, was not effectually completed till the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century. An event, almo&s;t for|tuitous and unexpected, gave a direction to that &s;pirit of curio&s;ity and di&s;covery, which had not yet appeared in its full force and extent, for want of an object. About the year 1453, the di&s;per&s;ion of the Greeks, after Con&s;tantinople had been occupied by the Turks, became the means of gratifying that natural love of novelty, which has &s;o fre|quently led the way to the noble&s;t improvements, by the introduction of a new language and new books<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and totally changed the &s;tate of letters in Europe <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">But it &s;hould be remembered, that &s;ome learned Grecians, fore&s;eeing the per&s;ecutions impending over their country, frequented Italy, and taught their language there, be|fore the taking of Con&s;tantinople. Some Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ks, who attended the Florentine coun|cil, and never returned for fear of the Turks, founded the pre&s;ent royal library in the city of Turenne. In the year 1401, the Greek emperor, unable to re&s;i&s;t the frequent in&s;ults of the&s;e barbarians, came into England to &s;eek redre&s;s or protection from Henry the fourth. He landed at Dover, attended by many learned Greeks; and the next day was honourably received at Chri&s;t-church priory at Canterbury, by the prior, Tho|mas Chyllenden.

<P>This great change commenced in Italy; a country, from many circum&s;tances, above all others peculiarly qualified and prepared to adopt &s;uch a deviation. Italy, during the darke&s;t periods of mona&s;tic ignorance, had always maintained a greater degree of refinement and knowledge than any other European country. In the thirteenth century, when the manners of Europe appear to have been overwhelmed with every &s;pecies of ab&s;urdity, its luxuries were le&s;s &s;avage, and its public &s;pectacles more rational, than tho&s;e of France,
<PB N="409" REF="415">
England, and Germany. Its inhabitants were not only en|riched, but enlightened, by that flouri&s;hing &s;tate of com|merce, which its commodious &s;ituation, aided by the com|bination of other concomitant advantages, contributed to &s;upport. Even from the time of the irruptions of the nor|thern barbarians, &s;ome glimmerings of the antient erudition &s;till remained in this country; and in the mid&s;t of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, repeated efforts were made in Italy to re&s;tore the Roman cla&s;&s;ics. To mention no other in|&s;tances, Alberti Mu&s;&s;ato<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">He was honoured with the laurel, and died 1329.</NOTE> of Padua, and a commander in the Paduan army again&s;t the Verone&s;e, wrote two Latin tragedies, ECERRINIS <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Printed at Venice, 1636. fol. with his EPISTOLAE, ELEGI, SOLILOQUIA, EC|LOGAE, CENTO OVIDIANUS, Latin Hi&s;|tory of Italy, and BAVARUS <HI>ad Filium.</HI> And in Muratori's RER.

The many monuments of legitimate &s;culpture and architecture pre&s;erved in Italy, had there kept alive ideas of elegance and grace; and the Italians, from their familiarity with tho&s;e precious remains of antiquity, &s;o early as the clo&s;e of the fourteenth century, had laid the rudiments of their per|fection in the antient arts. Another circum&s;tance which had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aring the way for this change, and which de&s;erves particular attention, was the innovation introduced into the Italian poetry by Petrarch: who, in&s;pired with the mo&s;t elegant of pa&s;&s;ions, and cloathing his exalted feelings on that delicate &s;ubject in the mo&s;t melodious and brilliant Italian ver&s;ification, had totally eclip&s;ed the barbarous
<PB N="410" REF="416">
beauties of the Provencial troubadours; and by this new and powerful magic, had in an eminent degree contributed to reclaim, at lea&s;t for a time, the public ta&s;te, from a love of Gothic manners and romantic imagery.</P>
<P>In this country, &s;o happily calculated for their favourable reception, the learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ugitives of Greece, when their empire was now de&s;troyed, found &s;helter and protection. Hither they imported, and here they interpreted, their antient writers, which had been pre&s;erved entire at Con&s;tantinople. The&s;e being eagerly &s;tudied by the be&s;t Italian &s;cholars, com|municated a ta&s;te for the graces of genuine poetry and elo|quence; and at the &s;ame time were in&s;trumental in propa|gating a more ju&s;t and general reli&s;h for the Roman poets, orators, and hi&s;torians. In the mean time a more elegant and &s;ublime philo&s;ophy was adopted: a philo&s;ophy more friendly to works of ta&s;te and imagination, and more agree|able to the &s;ort of reading which was now gaining ground. The &s;chola&s;tic &s;ubtleties, and the captious logic of Ari&s;totle, were aboli&s;hed for the mild and divine wi&s;dom of Plato.</P>
<P>It was a circum&s;tance, which gave the greate&s;t &s;plendour and importance to this new mode of erudition, that it was encouraged by the popes: who, con&s;idering the encourage|ment of literature as a new expedient to e&s;tabli&s;h their au|thority over the minds of men, and enjoying an opulent and peaceable dominion in the voluptuous region of Italy, extended their patronage on this occa&s;ion with a liberality &s;o generous and unre&s;erved, that the court of Rome on a &s;udden lo&s;t its au&s;tere character, and became the &s;eat of ele|gance and urbanity.

It is obvious to ob&s;erve, how little conformable, this ju&s;t ta&s;te, the&s;e elegant arts, and the&s;e new amu&s;ements, proved in their con&s;equences to the &s;pirit of the papal &s;y&s;tem: and it is remarkable, that the court of Rome, who&s;e &s;ole de&s;ign and intere&s;t it had been for &s;o many centuries, to en&s;lave the minds of men, &s;hould be the fir&s;t to re&s;tore the religious and intellectual liberties of Europe.

Nor would the encouragement of any other European potentate have availed &s;o much, in this great work of re&s;toring literature: as no other patronage could have operated with &s;o powerful and immediate an influence on that order of men, who, from the nature of their education and profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t always be the principal in&s;truments in &s;upporting every &s;pecies of liberal erudition.</P>

<P>Nor was the protection of king Henry the eighth, who notwith&s;tanding he had attacked the opinions of Luther, yet, from his natural liveline&s;s of temper and a love of novelty, thought favourably of the new improvements, of incon&s;ider|able influence in &s;upporting the re&s;toration of the Greek language.

happy in its con&s;equences, remains to be mentioned. The en|larged conceptions acquired by the &s;tudy of the Greek and Roman writers &s;eem to have re&s;tored to the human mind a free exertion of its native operations, and to have communicated a certain &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e in examining every &s;ubject: and at length to have relea&s;ed the intellectual capacity of man|kind from that habitual &s;ubjection, and that &s;ervility to &s;y&s;tem, which had hitherto prevented it from advancing any new principle, or adopting any new opinion. Hence, under the concurrent a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a preparation of circum&s;tances, all centering in the &s;ame period, aro&s;e the reformation of religion. But this defection from the catholic communion, alienated the thoughts of the learned from tho&s;e pur&s;uits by which it was produced; and diverted the &s;tudies of the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed &s;cholars, to inquiries into the practices and maxims of the primitive ages, the nature of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, the authority of &s;cripture and tradition, of popes, councils, and &s;choolmen: topics, which men were not yet qualified to treat with any degree of penetration, and on which the ideas of the times unenlightened by phi|lo&s;ophy, or warped by prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion, were not cal|culated to throw ju&s;t and rational illu&s;trations. When the bonds of &s;piritual unity were once broken, this &s;eparation from an e&s;tabli&s;hed faith ended in a variety of &s;ubordinate &s;ects, each of which called forth its re&s;pective champions into the field of religious contention. The &s;everal princes of chri&s;tendom were politically concerned in the&s;e di&s;putes; and the courts in which poets and orators had been recently care&s;&s;ed and rewarded, were now filled with that mo&s;t de|plorable &s;pecies of philo&s;ophers, polemical metaphy&s;icians. The public entry of Luther into Worms, when he had been &s;ummoned before the diet of that city, was equally &s;plendid with that of the emperor Charles the fifth <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Luther, Op. ii. 412. 414.</NOTE>. Rome in return,
<PB N="443" REF="449">
rou&s;ed from her deep repo&s;e of ten centuries, was compelled to vindicate her in&s;ulted doctrines with rea&s;oning and argument. The profound inve&s;tigations of Aquinas once more triumphed over the graces of the Ciceronian urbanity; and endle&s;s volumes were written on the expediency of auricular confe&s;&s;ion, and the exi&s;tence of purgatory. Thus the cau&s;e of polite literature was for awhile abandoned; while the noble&s;t abilities of Europe were wa&s;ted in theological &s;pecu|lation, and ab&s;orbed in the aby&s;s of controver&s;y. Yet it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that wit and raillery, drawn from the &s;ources of elegant erudition, were &s;ometimes applied, and with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, in this important di&s;pute. The lively colloquies of Era&s;mus, which expo&s;ed the &s;uper|&s;titious practices of the papi&s;ts, with much humour, and in pure Latinity, made more prote&s;tants than the ten tomes of John Calvin. A work of ridicule was now a new attempt: and it &s;hould be here ob&s;erved, to the honour of Era&s;mus, that he was the fir&s;t of the literary reformers who tried that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, at lea&s;t with any degree of po|pularity. The polite &s;cholars of Italy had no notion that the German theologi&s;ts were capable of making their readers laugh: they were now convinced of their mi&s;take, and &s;oon found that the German plea&s;antry prepared the way for a revolution, which proved of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence to Italy.</P>
<P>Another great temporary che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k given to the general &s;tate of letters in England at this period, was the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries. Many of the abu&s;es in civil &s;ociety are attended with &s;ome advantages. In the beginnings of refor|mation, the lo&s;s of the&s;e advantages is always felt very &s;en&s;ibly: while the benefit ari&s;ing from the change is the &s;low effect of time, and not immediately perceived or en|joyed. Scarce any in&s;titution can be imagined le&s;s favorable to the intere&s;ts of mankind than the mona&s;tic. Yet the&s;e &s;eminaries, although they were in a general view the nur&s;eries

In the beginning of the reign of queen Eli&s;abeth, which &s;oon followed, when the return of prote&s;tanti&s;m might have been expected to produce a &s;peedy change for the better, puritani&s;m began to prevail; and, as the fir&s;t fervours of a new &s;ect are always violent, retarded for &s;ome time the pro|gre&s;s of ingenuous and u&s;eful knowledge. The &s;criptures being tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and every man a&s;&s;uming a right to dictate in matters of faith, and to chu&s;e his own principles, weak heads drew fal&s;e conclu&s;ions, and erected an infinite variety of petty religions. Such is the abu&s;e which attends the be&s;t de&s;igns, that the meane&s;t reader of the new Te&s;tament thought he had a full comprehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t my&s;terious metaphy&s;ical doctrines in the chri&s;tian faith; and &s;corned to acquie&s;ce in the &s;ober and rational ex|po&s;itions of &s;uch difficult &s;ubjects, which he might have re|ceived from a competent and intelligent teacher, whom it was his duty to follow. The bulk of the people, who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing all theological topics, from their &s;ituation and circum&s;tances in life, were naturally aver&s;e to the &s;plendor, the dominion, and the opulence of an hierarchy, and di&s;claimed the yoke of epi&s;copal juri&s;|diction. The new deliverance from the numerous and bur|then&s;ome &s;uper&s;titions of the papal communion, drove many pious reformers into the contrary extreme, and the rage of oppo&s;ition ended in a devotion entirely &s;piritual and ab&s;tract|ed. External forms were aboli&s;hed, as impediments to the vi&s;ionary reveries of a mental intercour&s;e with heaven; and becau&s;e the church of Rome had carried ceremonies to an ab&s;urd exce&s;s, the u&s;e of any ceremonies was deemed un|lawful. The love of new doctrines and a new wor&s;hip, the triumph of gaining pro&s;elytes, and the per&s;ecutions which accompanied the&s;e licentious zealots, all contributed to fan the flame of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The genius of this refined and fal&s;e &s;pecies of religion, which defied the &s;alutary checks of all human authority, when operating in its full force,
<PB N="458" REF="464">
was attended with con&s;equences not le&s;s pernicious to &s;ociety, although le&s;s likely to la&s;t, than tho&s;e which flowed from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the antient &s;uper&s;titions. During this un&s;ettled &s;tate of things, the Engli&s;h reformed clergy who had fled into Germany from the menaces of queen Mary, returned home in great numbers: and in con&s;idera|tion of their &s;ufferings and learning, and their abilities to vindicate the principles of a national church erected in op|po&s;ition to that of Rome, many of them were preferred to bi&s;hopricks, and other eminent eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tations. The&s;e divines brought back with them into England tho&s;e narrow principles concerning church-government and ceremonies, which they had imbibed in the petty &s;tates and republics abroad, where the Calvini&s;tic di&s;cipline was adopted, and where they had lived like a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers; but which were totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of a more extended church, e&s;tabli&s;hed in a great and magnificent nation, and requiring an uniform &s;y&s;tem of policy, a regular &s;ubordination of officers, a &s;olemnity of public wor&s;hip, and an ob&s;ervance of exterior in&s;titutions. They were, how|ever, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, thought to be the mo&s;t proper in&s;truments to be employed at the head of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs; not only for the purpo&s;e of vindicating the new e&s;tabli&s;hment by argument and authority, but of eradica|ting every trace of the papal corruptions by their practice and example, and of effectually fixing the reformation em|braced by the church of England on a durable ba&s;is. But, unfortunately, this mea&s;ure, &s;pecious and expedient as it appeared at fir&s;t, tended to de&s;troy that con&s;titution which it was de&s;igned to &s;upport, and to counteract tho&s;e prin|ciples which had been implanted by Cranmer in the reform|ed &s;y&s;tem of our religion. Their reluctance or refu&s;al to con|form, in a variety of in&s;tances, to the e&s;tabli&s;hed ceremonies, and their refinements in theological di&s;cipline, filled the church with the mo&s;t violent divi&s;ions; and introduced endle&s;s

intricate di&s;putations, not on fundamental doctrines of &s;olid importance to the real intere&s;ts of chri&s;tianity, but on po&s;itive points of idle and empty &s;peculation, which ad|mitting no elegance of compo&s;ition, and calling forth no vigour of abilities, exerci&s;ed the learning of the clergy in the mo&s;t barbarous and barren field of controver&s;ial divinity, and ob&s;tructed every pur&s;uit of polite or manly erudition. Even the conforming clergy, from their want of penetration, and from their attachment to authorities, contributed to protract the&s;e frivolous and unbecoming controver&s;ies: for if, in their vindication of the &s;acerdotal ve&s;tments, and of the cro&s;s of bapti&s;m, in&s;tead of arguing from the jews, the primitive chri&s;tians, the fathers, councils, and cu&s;toms, they had only appealed to common &s;en&s;e and the nature of things, the propriety and expediency of tho&s;e formalities would have been much more ea&s;ily and more clearly demon|&s;trated. To the&s;e inconveniencies we mu&s;t add, that the common eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments were &s;o much dimini&s;hed by the &s;eizure and alienation of impropriations, in the late depredations of the church, and which continued to be carried on with the &s;ame &s;pirit of rapacity in the reign of Eli&s;abeth, that few per&s;ons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence, almo&s;t any that offered them&s;elves were, without di&s;tinction or examination, admitted to the &s;acred function. In&s;omuch, that in the year 1560, an injunction was directed to the bi&s;hop of London from his metropolitan, requiring him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other illi|terate per&s;ons who exerci&s;ed &s;ecular occupations <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype's GRINDAL.

Acqui&s;itions, whether in theology or humanity, were no longer exclu&s;ively confined to the clergy: the laity eagerly embraced tho&s;e pur&s;uits from which they had long been unju&s;tly re&s;trained: and, &s;oon after the reign of Eli&s;abeth, men attained that &s;tate of general improvement, and tho&s;e &s;ituations with re&s;pect to literature and life, in which they have ever &s;ince per&s;evered.</P>
<P>But it remains to bring home, and to apply, this change in the &s;entiments of mankind, to our main &s;ubject. The cu&s;toms, in&s;titutions, traditions, and religion, of the middle ages, were favorable to poetry. Their pageaunts, proce&s;&s;ions, &s;pectacles, and ceremonies, were friendly to imagery, to per&s;onification and allegory. Ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the real intere&s;ts of human &s;ociety, are the parents of imagina|tion. The very devotion of the Gothic times was romantic. The catholic wor&s;hip, be&s;ides that its numerous exteriour appendages were of a picture&s;que and even of a poetical na|ture, di&s;po&s;ed the mind to a &s;tate of deception, and encou|raged, or rather authori&s;ed, every &s;pecies of credulity: its vi&s;ions, miracles, and legends, propagated a general pro|pen&s;ity to the Marvellous, and &s;trengthened the belief of &s;pectres, demons, witches, and incantations. The&s;e illu&s;ions were heightened by churches of a wonderful mechani&s;m, and con&s;tructed on &s;uch principles of inexplicable archi|tecture as had a tendency to impre&s;s the &s;oul with every fal&s;e &s;en&s;ation of religious fear. The &s;avage pomp and the capricious heroi&s;m of the baronial manners, were replete with incident, adventure, and enterpri&s;e: and the intractable genius of the feudal policy, held forth tho&s;e irregularities of conduct, di&s;cordancies of intere&s;t, and di&s;&s;imilarities of &s;ituation, that framed rich materials for the min&s;trel-mu&s;e. The tacit compact of fa&s;hion, which promotes civility by
<PB N="463" REF="469">
diffu&s;ing habits of uniformity, and therefore de&s;troys pecu|liarities of character and &s;ituation, had not yet operated upon life: nor had dome&s;tic convenience aboli&s;hed unwieldy magnificence. Literature, and a better &s;en&s;e of things, not only bani&s;hed the&s;e barbarities, but &s;uper&s;eded the mode of compo&s;ition which was formed upon them. Romantic poetry gave way to the force of rea&s;on and inquiry; as its own inchanted palaces and gardens in&s;tantaneou&s;ly vani&s;hed, when the chri&s;tian champion di&s;played the &s;hield of truth, and baffled the charm of the necromancer. The &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics, together with a colder magic and a tamer my|thology, introduced method into compo&s;ition: and the uni|ver&s;al ambition of rivalling tho&s;e new patterns of excellence, the faultle&s;s models of Greece and Rome, produced that bane of invention, IMITATION. Erudition was made to act upon genius. Fancy was weakened by reflection and philo&s;ophy. The fa&s;hion of treating every thing &s;cientifically, applied &s;peculation and theory to the arts of writing. Judgment was advanced above imagination, and rules of critici&s;m were e&s;tabli&s;hed. The brave eccentricities of original genius, and the daring hardine&s;s of native thought, were intimidated by metaphy&s;ical &s;entiments of perfection and refinement. Setting a&s;ide the con&s;ideration of the more &s;olid advantages, which are obvious, and are not the di&s;tinct object of our contemplation at pre&s;ent, the lover of true poetry will a&s;k, what have we gained by this revolution? It may be an|&s;wered, much good &s;en&s;e, good ta&s;te, and good critici&s;m. But, in the mean time, we have lo&s;t a &s;et of manners, and a &s;y&s;tem of machinery, more &s;uitable to the purpo&s;es of poetry, than tho&s;e which have been adopted in their place. We have parted with extravagancies that are above propriety, with incredibilities that are more acceptable than truth, and with fictions that are more valuable than reality.</P>

From the &s;econd part of the fir&s;t French quotation which I have di&s;tingui&s;hed by Italics, it appears, that Walter Mapes, a learned archdeacon in England, under the reign of king Henry the &s;econd, wrote a French SANGREAL, which he tran&s;lated from Latin, by the command of that monarch. Un|der the idea, that Walter Mapes was a writer on this &s;ubject, and in the fabulous way, &s;ome critics may be induced to think, that the WALTER, archdeacon of Oxford, from whom Geof|frey of Monmouth profe&s;&s;es to have received the materials of his hi&s;tory, was this Walter Mapes, and not Walter Calenius, who was al&s;o an eminent &s;cholar, and an archdeacon of Oxford.

At length Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, a man of great eloquence, and learned in foreign hi&s;tories, offered me an ancient book in the Briti&s;h or Armorican tongue; which, in one unbroken &s;tory, and an elegant diction, re|lated the deeds of the Briti&s;h kings from Brutus to Cadwal|lader.

<P>Pag. 357. l. 7. ADD this Note. <Q REND="inline">"Boccacio's &s;ituations and incidents, re&s;pecting the lovers, are often inartificial and unaf|fecting. In the Italian poet, Emilia walking in the garden and &s;inging, is &s;een and heard fir&s;t by Arcite, who immediately calls Palamon. They are both equally, and at the &s;ame point of time, captivated with her beauty; yet without any expre&s;|&s;ions of jealou&s;y, or appearance of rivalry. But in Chaucer's management of the commencement of this amour, Palamon by &s;eeing Emilia fir&s;t, acquires an advantage over Arcite, which ultimately renders the cata&s;trophe more agreeable to poetical ju&s;tice. It is an unnatural and unanimated picture which Boc|cacio pre&s;ents, of the two young princes violently enamoured of the &s;ame object, and &s;till remaining in a &s;tate of amity. In Chaucer, the quarrel between the two friends, the foundation of all the future beautiful di&s;tre&s;s of the piece, commences at this moment, and cau&s;es a conver&s;ation full of mutual rage and re&s;entment. This rapid tran&s;ition from a friend&s;hip cemented by every tie, to the mo&s;t implacable ho&s;tility, is on this occa|&s;ion not only highly natural, but produces a &s;udden and unex|pected change of circum&s;tances, which enlivens the detail, and is always intere&s;ting. Even afterwards, when Arcite is relea&s;ed from the pri&s;on by Perithous, he embraces Palamon at parting. And in the fifth book of the THESEIDE, when Palamon goes armed to the grove in &s;earch of Arcite, whom he finds
<PB REF="504">
&s;leeping, they meet on terms of much civility and friend&s;hip, and in all the mechanical formality of the manners of romance. In Chaucer, this dialogue has a very different ca&s;t. Palamon at &s;eeing Arcite, feels a <HI>colde &s;werde</HI> glide throughout his heart: he &s;tarts from his ambu&s;cade, and in&s;tantly &s;alutes Arcite with the appellation of <HI>fal&s;e traitour.</HI> And although Boccacio has merit in di&s;criminating the characters of the two princes, by giving Palamon the impetuo&s;ity of Achilles, and Arcite the mildne&s;s of Hector; yet Arcite by Boccacio is here injudiciou&s;ly repre&s;ented as too moderate and pacific. In Chaucer he returns the &s;alute with the &s;ame degree of indignation, draws his &s;word, and defies Palamon to &s;ingle combat. So languid is Boccacio's plan of this amour, that Palamon does not begin to be jealous of Arcite, till he is informed in the pri&s;on, that Arcite lived as a favorite &s;ervant with The&s;eus in di&s;gui&s;e, yet known to Emilia. When the lovers &s;ee Emilia from the window of their tower, &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed by Boccacio to ob&s;erve them, and not to be di&s;plea&s;ed at their &s;igns of admiration. This circum&s;tance is ju&s;tly omit|ted by Chaucer, as quite unnece&s;&s;ary; and not tending either to promote the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, or to operate in any di&s;tant con&s;e|quences. On the whole, Chaucer has eminently &s;hewn his good &s;en&s;e and judgement in rejecting the &s;uperfluities, and improving the general arrangement, of the &s;tory. He fre|quently corrects or &s;oftens Boccacio's fal&s;e manners: and it is with &s;ingular addre&s;s he has often abridged the Italian poet's o&s;ten|tatious and pedantic parade of antient hi&s;tory and mythology.</Q></P>

Chaucer &s;peaks of him&s;elf as a tran&s;lator <HI>out of Latin,</HI> B. ii. 14. And he calls his author LOLLIUS, B. i. 394.&mdash;421. and B. v. 1652. The latter of the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages is in the PHILOSTRATO: but the former, containing Petrarch's &s;onnet, is not. And when Chaucer &s;ays, he <HI>tran&s;lates from Latin,</HI> we mu&s;t remember, that the <HI>Italian</HI> language was called <HI>Latino volgare.</HI> Shall we &s;uppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that Chaucer followed a more complete copy of the FILOSTRATO than that we have at pre&s;ent, or one enlarged by &s;ome officious interpolator? The Pari&s;ian manu&s;cript might perhaps clear the&s;e difficulties. In Bennet library at Cambridge, there is a manu&s;cript of Chaucer's TROILUS, elegantly written, with a fronti&s;piece beautifully illuminated, LXI.</Q></P>

But as the pe|culiar nature of the Provencial poetry entered deeply into the &s;ub&s;tance, ca&s;t, and character, of &s;ome of tho&s;e French and Italian models, which he is allowed to have followed, he cer|tainly may be &s;aid to have copied, although not immediately, the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of the&s;e writers. I have called his HOUSE OF FAME originally a Provencial compo&s;ition. I did not mean that it was written by a Provencial troubadour: but that Chaucer's original was compounded of the capricious mode of fabling, and that extravagant &s;tyle of fiction, which con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ence of the Provencial poetry. As to the
<PB REF="517">
FLOURE AND THE LEAFE, which Dryden pronounces to have been compo&s;ed <HI>after their manner,</HI> it is framed on the old allegori&s;ing &s;pirit of the Provencial writers, refined and disfi|gured by the fopperies of the French poets in the fourteenth century. The ideas of the&s;e fablers had been &s;o &s;trongly im|bibed, that they continued to operate long after Petrarch had introduced a more rational method of compo&s;ition.</Q></P>

But the CINQUANTE BALADES, or fifty French Sonnets abovementioned, are the curious and valuable part of lord Gower's manu&s;cript. They are not mentioned by tho&s;e who have written the life of this poet, or have catalogued his works. Nor do they appear in any other manu&s;cript of Gower which I have examined. But if they &s;hould be di&s;covered in any other, I will venture to pronounce, that a more authentic, unembar|ra&s;&s;ed, and practicable copy than this before us, will not be produced: although it is for the mo&s;t part unpointed, and ob|&s;cured with abbreviations, and with tho&s;e mi&s;pellings which flowed from a &s;cribe unacquainted with the French language.</P>
<P>To &s;ay no more, however, of the value which the&s;e little pieces may derive from being &s;o &s;carce and &s;o little known, they have much real and intrin&s;ic merit. They are tender, pathetic, and poetical; and place our old poet Gower in a more advan|tageous point of view than that in which he has hitherto been u&s;ually &s;een. I know not if any even among the French poets them&s;elves, of this period, have left a &s;et of more fini&s;hed &s;on|nets: for they were probably written when Gower was a young man, about the year 1350. Nor had yet any Engli&s;h poet treated the pa&s;&s;ion of love with equal delic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cy of &s;entiment, and elegance of compo&s;ition.

<P>Pag. 164. To the end of the Section, ADD, <Q REND="inline">"What is here &s;aid of Rowlie, was not only written, but printed, almo&s;t two years before the correct and complete edition of his Poems ap|peared. Had I been appri&s;ed of that publication, I &s;hould have been much more &s;paring in my &s;pecimens of the&s;e forgeries, which had been communicated to me in manu&s;cript, and which I imagined I was imparting to my readers as curio&s;ities. I had as yet &s;een only a few extracts of the&s;e poems; nor were tho&s;e tran&s;cripts which I received, always exact. Circum&s;tances which I mention here, to &s;hew the inconveniencies under which I laboured, both with regard to my citations and my critici&s;ms. The&s;e &s;canty materials, however, contained &s;uffi|cient evidence to convince me, that the pieces were not genuine.</Q></P>
<P>The entire and accurate collection of Rowlie's now laid be|fore the public, has been &s;o little in&s;trumental in inducing me to change my opinion, that it has &s;erved to exemplify and con|firm every argument which I have produced in &s;upport of my
<PB REF="537">
&s;u&s;picions of an impo&s;ition. It has likewi&s;e afforded &s;ome new proofs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been conver&s;ant in the works even of the be&s;t of our old Engli&s;h poets, well know, that one of their leading characteri&s;tics is inequality. In the&s;e writers, &s;plendid de&s;criptions, ornamental compari&s;ons, poetical images, and &s;tri|king thoughts, occur but rarely: for many pages together, they are tedious, pro&s;aic, and unintere&s;ting. On the contrary, the poems before us are every where &s;upported: they are through|out, poetical and animated. They have no imbecillities of &s;tyle or &s;entiment. Our old Engli&s;h bards abound in unnatural con|ceptions, &s;trange imaginations, and even the mo&s;t ridiculous ab&s;urdities. But Rowlie's poems pre&s;ent us with no incon|gruous combinations, no mixture of manners, in&s;titutions, cu&s;|toms, and characters. They appear to have been compo&s;ed after ideas of di&s;crimination had taken place; and when even common writers had begun to conceive, on mo&s;t &s;ubjects, with preci&s;ion and propriety. There are indeed, in the BATTLE OF HAST|INGS, &s;ome great anachroni&s;ms; and practices are mentioned which did not exi&s;t till afterwards. But the&s;e are &s;uch incon|&s;i&s;tencies, as proceeded from fraud as well as ignorance: they are &s;uch as no old poet could have po&s;&s;ibly fallen into, and which only betray an un&s;kilful imitation of antient manners. The ver&s;es of Lydgate and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are often rugged and un|mu&s;ical: but Rowlie's poetry &s;u&s;tains one uniform tone of har|mony; and, if we bru&s;h away the a&s;perities of the antiquated &s;pelling, conveys its cultivated imagery in a poli&s;hed and agree|able &s;train of ver&s;ification. Chatterton &s;eems to have thought, that the di&s;tinction of old from modern poetry con&s;i&s;ted only in the u&s;e of old words. In counterfeiting the coins of a rude age, he did not forget the u&s;ual application of an artificial ru&s;t: but this di&s;gui&s;e was not &s;ufficient to conceal the elegance of the workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>The BATTLE OF HASTINGS, ju&s;t mentioned, might be proved to be a palpable forgery for many other rea&s;ons. It is
<PB REF="538">
&s;aid to be tran&s;lated from the Saxon of Turgot. But Turgot died in 1015, and the battle of Ha&s;tings was fought in 1066. We will, however, allow, that Turgot lived in the reign of the Conqueror. But, on that &s;uppo&s;ition, is it not extraor|dinary, that a cotemporary writer &s;hould mention no circum|&s;tances of this action which we did not know before, and which are not to be found in Malm&s;bury, Ordericus Vitalis, and other antient chroniclers? E&s;pecially as Turgot's de&s;cription of this battle was profe&s;&s;edly a detached and &s;eparate performance, and at lea&s;t, on that account, would be minute and circum&s;tantial. An original and a cotemporary writer, de&s;cribing this battle, would not only have told us &s;omething new, but would other|wi&s;e have been full of particularities. The poet before us dwells on incidents common to all battles, and &s;uch as were ea&s;ily to be had from Pope's HOMER. We may add, that this piece not only detects it&s;elf, but demon&s;trates the &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s of all the re&s;t. Chatterton him&s;elf allowed the fir&s;t part of it to be a forgery of his own. The &s;econd part, from what has been &s;aid, could not be genuine. And he who could write the &s;econd part was able to write every line in the whole collection. But while I am &s;peaking of this poem, I cannot help expo&s;ing the futility of an argument which has been brought as a deci|&s;ive evidence of its originality. It is urged, that the names of the chiefs who accompanied the Conqueror, corre&s;pond with the Roll of Battle-Abbey. As if a modern forger could not have &s;een this venerable record. But, unfortunately, it is printed in Hollin&s;head's Chronicle.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that Chatterton, on account of his youth and edu|cation, could not write the&s;e poems. This may be true; but it is no proof that they are not forged. Who was their author, on the hypothe&s;is that Rowlie was not, is a new and another que&s;tion. I am, however, of opinion that it was Chatterton. For if we attend only to &s;ome of the pieces now extant in a periodical magazine, which he publi&s;hed under his own &s;ig|nature, and which are confe&s;&s;edly of his compo&s;ition, to his
<PB REF="539">
letters now remaining in manu&s;cript, and to the te&s;timony of tho&s;e that were acquainted with his conver&s;ation, he will appear to have been a &s;ingular in&s;tance of a prematurity of abilities; to have acquired a &s;tore of general information far exceeding his years, and to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that comprehen&s;ion of mind, and activity of under&s;tanding, which predominated over his &s;itua|tions in life, and his opportunities of in&s;truction. Some of his publications in the magazines di&s;cover al&s;o his propen&s;ity to forgery, and more particularly in the walk of antient man|ners, which &s;eem greatly to have &s;truck his imagination. The&s;e, among others, are ETHELGAR, a <HI>Saxon poem</HI> in pro&s;e; KENRICK, <HI>tran&s;lated from the Saxon;</HI> CERDICH, <HI>tran&s;lated from the Saxon;</HI> GODRED CROVAN, a Poem, <HI>compo&s;ed by Doth|nel Syrric king of the i&s;le of Man;</HI> The HIRLAS, <HI>compo&s;ed by Blythyn, prince of North Wales;</HI> GOTHMUND, <HI>tran&s;lated from the Saxon;</HI> ANECDOTE of CHAUCER, and of the ANTIQUITY of CHRISTMAS GAMES. The latter piece, in which he quotes a regi&s;ter of Kein&s;ham NUNNERY, which was a priory of Black canons, and advances many imaginary facts, &s;trongly &s;hews his track of reading, and his fondne&s;s for antiquarian imagery. In this monthly collection he in&s;erted ideal drawings of &s;ix achieve|ments of Saxon heraldry, of an inedited coin of queen Sex|burgeo, wife of king Kinewalch, and of a Saxon amulet; with explanations equally fanta&s;tic and arbitrary. From Rowlie's pretended parchments he produced &s;everal heraldic delineations. He al&s;o exhibited a draught by Rowlie of Bri&s;tol ca&s;tle in its perfect &s;tate. I very much doubt if this fortre&s;s was not almo&s;t totally ruinous in the reign of Edward the fourth. This draught, however, was that of an edifice evidently fictitious. It was exceedingly ingenious; but it was the repre&s;entation of a building which never exi&s;ted, in a capricious and affected &s;tyle of Gothic architecture, reducible to no period or &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>To the whole that is here &s;ugge&s;ted on this &s;ubject, let us add Chatterton's inducements and qualifications for forging the&s;e poems, ari&s;ing from his character, and way of living. He
<PB REF="540">
