<HEAD>An ANSWER To The Tale of a Nettle.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by D. D'FOE.</BYLINE>

<L>WHen the Good Man was won to &s;o Gracious a Deed,</L>
<L>As to Tolerate the <HI>Nettle</HI> and his Cur&s;ed Seed,</L>
<L>He ne'er imagin'd this <HI>Vip'rous Brood</HI></L>
<L>Wou'd be &s;o Ungrateful and mon&s;trou&s;ly Rude,</L>
<L>As to plead any Title to the <HI>Right of his Ground</HI>;</L>
<L>Which had Co&s;t the <HI>Ju&s;t Man</HI> &s;o many fair Pound.</L>
<L>He then ca&s;t about what to do in the main,</L>
<L>And <HI>Council</HI> he call'd to advi&s;e with the &s;ame.</L>
<L><HI>Good Sir,</HI> &s;ays the Council, <HI>do but try 'um with &s;peed.</HI></L>
<L><HI>They pretend to much Sanctity, call em &s;elves the Lords &s;eed</HI></L>
<L><HI>And none are &s;o righteous and &s;eemingls Holly,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As the Off&s;pring of</HI> Nettle. <HI>Hypocritical Folly</HI></L>
<L><HI>I pre&s;ume you have gotten, and in&s;tead of being ju&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I doubt they'll Betrap you on any di&s;gust:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Therefore I advi&s;e you without more ado,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You now being old, may grow wi&s;er too;</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Experience will teach, what I now &s;hall declare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let none in your Ground any port of it &s;hare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But &s;uch as will &s;wear to be True to your Heir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Support You and Him against all Invaders</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of Yours and his Right; let no de&s;perate Bravado's</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make you the more fear them, or e&s;teem your &s;elf little,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For they'll &s;oon cut you out by the Scythe or the Sickle:</HI></L>
<L><HI>If once they are &s;ure that you dread their Power,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You nor Yours &s;hall never be quiet one Hour.</HI></L>

<L>I thank you, good Friend, for your good Advice,</L>
<L>I'll follow your Coun&s;el, and &s;trait in a trice</L>
<L>He &s;ummon'd the <HI>Nettles,</HI> and told them the Cau&s;e.</L>
<L>A Motion he made for to bind them in Laws,</L>
<L>For their good and's own; and &s;o would in &s;hort</L>
<L>Admit them to hold that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in part</L>
<L>Of his Ground they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, if they would with &s;peed</L>
<L>Swear to pre&s;erve it to him and his Seed.</L>
<L>They unanimou&s;ly con&s;ented, and without more ado,</L>
<L>Took the Oaths unto Him, and his Succeffor too;</L>
<L>Thus being admitted to a free Toleration,</L>
<L>A handle they got for their pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>And now they began to di&s;pute with their <HI>Ma&s;t&ecirc;r,</HI></L>
<L>And incroached on him, even fa&s;ter and fa&s;ter,</L>
<L>And told him in &s;hort they'd aright to his Land,</L>
<L>For he gave 'em Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion under his own Hand.</L>
<L>And thus they daily created Him trouble,</L>
<L>And plaguly vex'd the good Man that was Noble;</L>
<L>They mighty Combu&s;tion did rai&s;e in his Ground,</L>
<L>And <HI>Cedars</HI> and <HI>Elms</HI> they met their Deaths Wound,</L>
<L>And all &s;orts of Trees that were <HI>Royally</HI> given,</L>
<L>Were rooted up quite, tho' their Tops reach'd to Heaven:</L>
<L>And after they had thus de&s;troy'd his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>The <HI>Royal-Oaks-Head</HI> was cut off by Commi&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>And nothing there left but <HI>Brdmbles</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;hes,</HI></L>
<L>Viporous Stinging <HI>Nettles</HI> and &s;illy poor <HI>Ru&s;hes</HI>;</L>
<L>The <HI>Bramble</HI> bore &s;way, and beat down the re&s;t</L>
<L>Of all his fine Plants, and Fruits of the be&s;t,</L>
<L>And &s;o it continued in Confu&s;ion &s;o long,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Right</HI> did take Place and o'ercome <HI>Wrong.</HI></L>
<L>And now &s;ince the <HI>Ground</HI> is re&s;tored as before,</L>
<L>Take care how the <HI>Nettle</HI> Stings you any more:</L>
<L>And &s;ince the <HI>Handle</HI> you have once again got,</L>
<L>Keep it fa&s;t le&s;t your <HI>Ground</HI> goes once more to Pot.</L>
