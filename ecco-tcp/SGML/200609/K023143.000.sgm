<HEAD>A KEY to the <HI>LOCK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE this unhappy Divi&s;ion of our Nation into Parties, it is not to be ima|gined how many Artifices have been made u&s;e of by Writers to ob&s;cure the Truth, and cover De&s;igns, which may be de|trimental to the Publick; in particular, it has been their Cu&s;tom of late to vent their Politi|cal Spleen in Allegory and Fable. If an ho|ne&s;t believing Nation is to be made a Je&s;t of, we have a Story of <HI>John Bull</HI> and his Wife; if a Trea&s;urer is to be glanced at, an <HI>Ant</HI> with a <HI>white Straw</HI> is introduced; if a Treaty of Com|merce is to be ridiculed, 'tis immediately me|tamorpho&s;ed into a Tale of Count <HI>Tariff.</HI></P>
<P>But if any of the&s;e Malevolents have never &s;o &s;mall a Talent in Rhime, they principally delight to convey their Malice in that plea&s;ing way, as it were, gilding the Pill, and con|cealing the Poy&s;on under the Sweetne&s;s of Numbers. Who could imagine that an <HI>Origi|nal</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Canto</HI> of <HI>Spencer</HI> &s;hould contain a Satyr upon one Admini&s;tration; or that <HI>Yarhel</HI>'s <HI>Kitchin,</HI> or the <HI>Dogs of Egypt,</HI> &s;hould be a Sar|ca&s;m upon another.</P>
<P>It is the Duty of every well de&s;igning Sub|ject to prevent, as far as in him lies, the ill Con&s;equences of &s;uch pernicious Treati&s;es; and I hold it mine to warn the Publick of the late Poem, entituled, the <HI>RAPE of the LOCK;</HI> which I &s;hall demon&s;trate to be of this nature. Many of the&s;e &s;ort of Books have been bought by hone&s;t and well-meaning People purely for their Diver&s;ion, who have in the end found them&s;elves in&s;en&s;ibly led into the Vio|lence of Party Spirit, and many dome&s;tick Quarrels have been occa&s;ioned by the diffe|rent Application of the&s;e Books. The Wife of an eminent Citizen grew very noi&s;y upon reading <HI>Bob Hu&s;h; John Bull,</HI> upon <HI>Change,</HI> was thought not only to concern the State, but to affront the City; and the Poem we are now treating of, has not only di&s;&s;olved an a|greeable A&s;&s;embly of Beaus and Belles, but (as I am told) has &s;et Relations at as great a di|&s;tance, as if they were married together.</P>
<P>It is a common and ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation, that when the Meaning of any thing is dubious, one can no way better judge of the true Intent of it, than by con&s;idering who is the Author, what is his Character in general, and his Di&s;|po&s;ition in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
Now that the Author of this Poem is pro|fe&s;&s;edly a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> is well known; and that a Genius &s;o capable of doing Service to that Cau&s;e, may have been corrupted in the Cour&s;e of his Education by <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> or others, is ju&s;tly very much to be &s;u&s;pected; notwith&s;tanding that &s;eeming <HI>Coolne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> which he has been (perhaps artfully) reproached with, by tho&s;e of his own Profe&s;&s;ion. They are &s;en&s;ible that this Nation is &s;ecured with good and whole&s;ome Laws to prevent all evil Practi|ces of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> particularly the Publication of Books, that may in any &s;ort propagate that Doctrine: Their Authors are therefore obliged to couch their De&s;igns the deeper; and tho' I cannot averr that the In|tention of this Gentleman was directly to &s;pread Popi&s;h Doctrines, yet it comes to the &s;ame Point, if he touch the Government: For the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> knows very well, that the Church at this time is &s;o firmly founded on the State, that the only way to &s;hake the one is by attacking the other.</P>
<P>What confirms me in this Opinion, is an accidental Di&s;covery I made of a very artful Piece of Management among his Popi&s;h Friends and Abettors, to hide this whole De&s;ign upon the Government, by taking all the Characters upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon the Day that this Poem was publi&s;hed, it was my Fortune to &s;tep into the <HI>Cocoa Tree,</HI> where a certain Gentleman was railing very
<PB N="10" REF="9">
liberally at the Author, with a Pa&s;&s;ion extreme|ly well counterfeited, for having (as he &s;aid) reflected upon him in the Character of <HI>Sir Plume.</HI> Upon his going out, I enquired who he was, and they told me, <HI>a Roman Catholick Knight.</HI></P>
<P>I was the &s;ame Evening at <HI>Will</HI>'s, and &s;aw a Circle round another Gentleman, who was railing in like manner, and &s;howing his Snuff|box and Cane to prove he was &s;atyrized in the &s;ame Character. I asked this Gentleman's Name, and was told, he was <HI>a Roman Catho|lick Lord.</HI></P>
<P>A Day or two after I was &s;ent for, upon a &s;light Indi&s;po&s;ition, to the young Lady's to whom the Poem is dedicated. She al&s;o took up the Character of <HI>Belinda</HI> with much Frank|ne&s;s and good Humour, tho' the Author has given us a Key in his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">The Character of <HI>Belinda</HI> (as it is here manag'd) re&s;emble you in nothing but in Beauty. <BIBL>Dedication to the <HI>Rape of the Lock.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> Dedication, that he meant &s;omething further. This Lady is al|&s;o a <HI>Roman Catholick.</HI> At the &s;ame time others of the Characters were claim'd by &s;ome Per|&s;ons in the Room; and all of them <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed to the Work it &s;elf.</P>
<P>In all things which are intricate, as Alle|gories in their own Nature are, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="11" REF="10">
tho&s;e that are indu&s;triou&s;ly made &s;o, it is not to be expected we &s;hould find the Clue at fir&s;t &s;ight; but when once we have laid hold on that, we &s;hall trace this our Author through all the Labyrinths, Doublings and Turnings of this intricate Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then let it be ob&s;erved, that in the mo&s;t demon&s;trative Sciences &s;ome <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> are to be granted, upon which the re&s;t is naturally founded. I &s;hall de&s;ire no more than one <HI>Po|&s;tulatum</HI> to render this obvious to the meane&s;t Capacity; which being granted me, I &s;hall not only &s;hew the Intent of this Work in gene|ral, but al&s;o explain the very <HI>Names,</HI> and expo&s;e all his fictitious <HI>Characters</HI> in their true Light; and we &s;hall find, that even his <HI>Spirits</HI> were not meerly contrived for the &s;ake of <HI>Machinary.</HI></P>
<P>The only Conce&s;&s;ion which I de&s;ire to be made me, is, that by the <HI>Lock</HI> is meant
<Q><L>The BARRIER TREATY.</L></Q></P>
<P N="1">I. Fir&s;t then I &s;hall di&s;cover, that BELINDA repre&s;ents GREAT BRITAIN, or (which is the &s;ame thing) her late MAJESTY. This is plain|ly &s;een in his De&s;cription of her. <Q><L>On her white Brea&s;t a &s;parkling Cro&s;s &s;he bore.</L></Q>

<P>There are other inferior Characters, which we &s;hall ob&s;erve upon afterwards; but I &s;hall fir&s;t explain the foregoing.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the <HI>Baron</HI>'s Character is his being <HI>adventrous,</HI> or enterprizing, which is the common Epithet given the E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI> by his Enemies.

<L>Of twelve va&s;t <HI>French</HI> Romances neatly gilt.</L></Q>

One of the things he &s;acrifices is a <HI>Fan,</HI> which both for its <HI>gaudy Show</HI> and <HI>perpetual Flutt'ring,</HI> has been made the Emblem of <HI>Woman.</HI> This points at the Change of the <HI>Ladies</HI> of the <HI>Bed|chamber;</HI> the <HI>Garter</HI> alludes to the Honours he conferr'd on &s;ome of his Friends; and we may without &s;training the Sen&s;e, call the Half Pair of Gloves, a <HI>Gauntlet;</HI> the Token of tho&s;e Military Employments, which he is &s;aid to have &s;acrificed to his De&s;igns.

But more particularly in &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in her Speech to <HI>Belinda,</HI> upon the cutting off the Lock, or Treaty.

His earne&s;t Eye, or the Viva|city of his Look, is &s;o particularly remarkable in him that this Character could be mi&s;taken for no other, had not this Author purpo&s;ely ob&s;cur'd it by the fictitious Circum&s;tance of a <HI>round, unthinking Face.</HI></P>
<P>Having now explained the chief Characters of his <HI>Human Per&s;ons</HI> (for there are &s;ome o|thers that will hereafter fall in by the by, in the Sequel of this Di&s;cour&s;e) I &s;hall next take in pieces his <HI>Machinary,</HI> wherein his Satyr is wholly confined to Mini&s;ters of State.</P>
<P>The SYLPHS and GNOMES at fir&s;t &s;ight ap|peared to me to &s;ignify the two contending Parties of this Nation; for the&s;e being placed in the <HI>Air,</HI> and tho&s;e on the <HI>Earth,</HI> I thought agreed very well with the common Denomi|nation, HIGH and LOW. But as they are made to be the fir&s;t Movers and Influencers of
<PB N="16" REF="15">
all that happens, 'tis plain they repre&s;ent pro|mi&s;euou&s;ly the <HI>Heads of Parties,</HI> whom he makes to be the Authors of all tho&s;e Changes in the State, which are generally imputed to the Levity and In&s;tability of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Na|tion. <Q><L>This erring Mortals Levity may call.</L>
<L>Oh blind to Truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.</L></Q>
But of this he has given us a plain Demon&s;tra|tion; for &s;peaking of the&s;e Spirits, he &s;ays in expre&s;s Terms.<Q><L>&mdash;The chief the Care of Nations own,</L>
<L>And guard with Arms Divine the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne.</L></Q></P>
<P> And here let it not &s;eem odd, if in this my|&s;terious way of Writing, we find the &s;ame Per&s;on, who has before been repre&s;ented by the <HI>Baron,</HI> again de&s;cribed in the Character of <HI>Ariel;</HI> it being a common way with Authors, in this fabulous Manner, to take &s;uch a Liber|ty. As for in&s;tance, I have read in the <HI>Engli&s;h St. Evremont,</HI> that all the different Characters in <HI>Petronius</HI> are but <HI>Nero</HI> in &s;o many different Appearances. And in the Key to the curious Romance of <HI>Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Argenis,</HI> that both <HI>Poli|archus</HI> and <HI>Archombrotus</HI> mean only the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Navarre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
We ob&s;erve in the very Beginning of the Poem, that <HI>Ariel</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Ear of <HI>Be|linda;</HI> therefore it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that this Per&s;on mu&s;t be the Mini&s;ter who was neare&s;t the Queen.

<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
To put this Matter beyond all di&s;pute, the <HI>Sylphs</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>wond'rous fond of Place,</HI> in the Canto following, where <HI>Ariel</HI> is perched uppermo&s;t, and all the re&s;t take their Places &s;ubordinately under him.</P>
<P>Here again I cannot but ob&s;erve, the exce&s;|&s;ive Malignity of this Author, who could not leave this Character of <HI>Ariel</HI> without the &s;ame invidious Stroke which he gave him in the Cha|racter of the <HI>Baron</HI> before. <Q><L>Amaz'd, confus'd, he &s;aw his Pow'r expir'd,</L>
<L>Re&s;ign'd to Fate, and with a Sigh retir'd.</L></Q>
Being another Prophecy that he &s;hould re&s;ign his Place, which it is probable all Mini&s;ters do with a Sigh.</P>
<P>At the Head of the <HI>Gnomes</HI> he &s;ets <HI>&V;mbriel,</HI> a dusky melancholy Spright, who makes it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to give <HI>Belinda</HI> the Spleen; a vile and malicious Sugge&s;tion again&s;t &s;ome grave and worthy Mini&s;ter. The Vapours, Fantoms, Vi&s;ions, and the like, are the Jealou&s;ies, Fears, and Cries of Danger, that have &s;o often af|frighted and alarm'd the Nation. Tho&s;e who are de&s;cribed in the Hou&s;e of Spleen under tho&s;e &s;everal fanta&s;tical Forms, are the &s;ame whom their Ill-willers have &s;o often called the <HI>Whim&s;ical.</HI></P>
<P>The two foregoing Spirits being the only con&s;iderable Characters of the Machinary, I
<PB N="19" REF="18">
&s;hall but ju&s;t mention the <HI>Sylph</HI> that is wound|ed with the Sci&s;&s;ars at the Lo&s;s of the Lock, by whom is undoubtedly under&s;tood my L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d <HI>To<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d,</HI> who at that time received a Wound in his Character for making the Barrier Trea|ty, and was cut out of his Employment upon the Di&s;&s;olution of it: But that Spirit reunites, and receives no Harm; to &s;ignify, that it came to nothing, and his L-rd&s;h-p had no real Hurt by it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not conclude this Head of the Characters, without ob&s;erving, that our Au|thor has run through every Stage of Beings in &s;earch of Topicks for Detraction; and as he has characterized &s;ome Per&s;ons under Angels and Men, &s;o he has others under Animals, and things inanimate. He has repre&s;ented an emi|nent Clergy-man as a Dog, and a noted Writer as a Tool. Let us examine the former.<Q><L>&mdash;But <HI>Shock,</HI> who thought &s;he &s;lept too long,</L>
<L>Leapt up, and wak'd his Mi&s;tre&s;s with his Tongue.</L>

with his <HI>Sermon,</HI> which made &s;o much <HI>Noi&s;e;</HI> and for which he has frequently been term'd by others of his Enemies, as well as by this Author, a Dog: Or perhaps, by his <HI>Tongue,</HI> may be more literally meant his <HI>Speech</HI> at his <HI>Trial,</HI> &s;ince immediately thereupon, our Au|thor &s;ays, her Eyes open'd on a <HI>Billet-doux; Billets-doux</HI> being Addre&s;les to Ladies from Lovers, may be aptly interpreted tho&s;e Ad|dre&s;&s;es of Loving Subjects to her M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y, which en&s;ued that Trial.</P>
<P>The other In&s;tance is at the End of the third Canto.<Q><L>Steel did the Labours of the Gods de&s;troy,</L>

<L>Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</L>
<L>And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here he mo&s;t impudently attributes the De|molition of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> not to the Plea&s;ure of her M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y, or her Mini&s;try, but to the frequent In&s;tigations of his Friend Mr. <HI>Steel;</HI> a very artful Pun to conceal his wicked Lampoo|nery!</P>
<P>Having now con&s;idered the general Intent and Scope of the Poem, and open'd the Cha|racters, I &s;hall next di&s;cover the Malice which is covered under the Epi&s;odes, and particular Pa&s;&s;ages of it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
The Game at <HI>Ombre</HI> is a my&s;tical Repre&s;en|tation of the late War, which is hinted by his making Spades the Trump; Spade in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ignifying a Sword, and being yet &s;o painted in the Cards of that Nation; to which it is well known we owe the Original of our Cards. In this one Place indeed he has unawares paid a Compliment to the Queen, and her Suc|ce&s;s in the War; for <HI>Belinda</HI> gets the better of the two that play again&s;t her, the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>I do not que&s;tion but ev'ry particular Card has its Per&s;on and Character a&s;&s;igned, which, no doubt, the Author has told his Friends in private; but I &s;hall only in&s;tance in the De|&s;cription of the Di&s;grace under which the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ough</HI> then &s;uffer'd, which is &s;o appa|rent in the&s;e Ver&s;es.<Q><L>Ev'n mighty <HI>Pam,</HI> that Kings and Queens o'er|threw,</L>
<L>And mow'd down Armies in the Fights of <HI>Lu,</HI></L>
<L>Sad Chance of War! now de&s;titute of Aid,</L>
<L>Falls undi&s;tingui&s;h'd&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>That the Author here had an Eye to our modern Tran&s;actions, is very plain from an unguarded Stroke towards the End of this Game.<Q><PB N="22" REF="21">
<L>And now, as oft in &s;ome <HI>di&s;temper'd State,</HI></L>
<L>On <HI>one nice Trick</HI> depends the gen'ral Fate.</L></Q></P>
<P>After the Conclu&s;ion of the War, the pub|lick Rejoicings and <HI>Thank&s;givings</HI> are ridiculed in the two following Lines. <Q><L>The Nymph exalting fills with Shouts the Sky,</L>
<L>The Walls, the Woods, and long Canals reply.</L></Q>
Immediately upon which there follows a ma|licious In&s;inuation, in the manner of a Prophe|cy (which we have formerly ob&s;erv'd this &s;e|ditious Writer delights in) that the Peace &s;hould continue but a &s;hort time, and that the Day &s;hould afterwards be cur&s;t which was then celebrated with &s;o much Joy.<Q><L>Sudden the&s;e Honours &s;hall be &s;natch'd away,</L>
<L>And cur&s;t for ever this Victorious Day.</L></Q></P>
<P>As the Game at <HI>Ombre</HI> is a &s;atyrical Repre|&s;entation of the late War; &s;o is the Tea-Table that en&s;ues, of the Council-Table and its Con|&s;ultations after the Peace. By this he would hint, that all the Advantages we have gain'd by our late extended Commerce, are only Cof|fee
<PB N="23" REF="22">
and Tea, or things of no greater Value. That he thought of the Trade in this Place, appears by the Pa&s;&s;age where he repre&s;ents the <HI>Sylphs</HI> particularly careful of the <HI>rich Bro|cade;</HI> it having been a frequent Complaint of our Mercers, that <HI>French Brocades</HI> were im|ported in too great Quantities. I will not &s;ay, he means tho&s;e Pre&s;ents of rich Gold Stuff Suits, which were &s;aid to be made her M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y by the K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, tho' I cannot but &s;u&s;|pect, that he glances at it.</P>
<P>Here this Author, as well as the &s;candalous <HI>John Dunton,</HI> repre&s;ents the Mi<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry in plain Terms taking frequent Cups.<Q><L>And frequent Cups prolong the rich Repa&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is manife&s;t he meant &s;omething more than common Coffee, by his calling it,
<Q><L>Coffee that makes the <HI>Politician</HI> wi&s;e.</L></Q>
And by telling us, it was this Coffee, that
<Q><L>Sent up in Vapours to the <HI>Baron</HI>'s Brain</L>
<L>New <HI>Stratagems</HI>&mdash;</L></Q>
I &s;hall only further ob&s;erve, that 'twas at this Table the Lock was cut off; for where but at the Council Board &s;hould the Barrier Treaty be di&s;&s;olved?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
The en&s;uing Contentions of the Parties upon the Lo&s;s of that Treaty, are de&s;cribed in the Squabbles following the Rape of the Lock; and this he ra&s;hly expre&s;&s;es, without any di&s;gui&s;e in the Words. <Q><L>All &s;ide in <HI>Parties</HI>&mdash;</L></Q>
Here fir&s;t you have a Gentleman who &s;inks be&s;ide his Chair: a plain Allu&s;ion to a Noble Lord, who lo&s;t his Chair of Pre<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nt of the Co<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l.</P>
<P>I come next to the <HI>Bodkin,</HI> &s;o dreadful in the Hand of <HI>Belinda;</HI> by which he intimates the <HI>Briti&s;h Scepter</HI> &s;o rever'd in the Hand of our late Augu&s;t Prince&s;s. His own Note upon this Place tells us he alludes to a Scepter; and the Ver&s;es are &s;o plain, they need no Remark.<Q><L>The &s;ame (his antient Per&s;onage to deck)</L>
<L>Her great great Grand&s;ire wore about his Neck</L>
<L>In three Seal Rings, which, after melted down,</L>
<L>Form'd a va&s;t Buckle for his Widow's Gown;</L>
<L>Her Infant Grandame's Whi&s;tle next it grew,</L>
<L>The Bells &s;he gingled, and the Whi&s;tle blew,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="24">
Then in a Bodkin grac'd her Mother's Hairs,</L>
<L>Which long &s;he wore, and now <HI>Belinda</HI> wears.</L></Q></P>
<P>An open Satyr upon <HI>Hereditary Right.</HI> The three Seal Rings plainly allude to the three Kingdoms.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief Pa&s;&s;ages in the Battle, by which, as hath before been &s;aid, he means the Squabble of Parties. Upon this Occa&s;ion he could not end the De&s;cription of them, without te&s;tifying his malignant Joy at tho&s;e Di&s;&s;entions, from which he forms the Pro&s;pect that <HI>both</HI> &s;hould be di&s;appointed, and cries out with Triumph, as if it were already accom|pli&s;hed.<Q><L>Behold how oft ambitious Arms are crost,</L>
<L>And Chiefs contend till all the Prize is lost.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Lock at length is turn'd into a <HI>Star,</HI> or the Old Barrier Treaty into a new and glori|ous <HI>Peace;</HI> this no doubt is what the Author, at the time he printed his Poem, would have been thought to mean, in hopes by that Com|plement to e&s;cape Puni&s;hment for the re&s;t of his Piece. It puts me in mind of a Fellow, who concluded a bitter Lampoon upon the Prince and Court of his Days, with the&s;e Lines.<Q><PB N="26" REF="25">
<L>God &s;ave the King, the Commons, and the Peers,</L>
<L>And grant the Author long may wear his Ears.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whatever this Author may think of that Peace, I imagine it the mo&s;t <HI>extraordinary Star</HI> that ever appear'd in our Hemi&s;phere. A Star that is to bring us all the Wealth and Gold of the <HI>Indies;</HI> and from who&s;e Influence, not Mr. <HI>John Partridge</HI> alone, (who&s;e worthy Labours this Writer &s;o ungenerou&s;ly ridicules) but all true <HI>Britains</HI> may, with no le&s;s Autho|rity than he, progno&s;ticate the Fall of <HI>Lewis,</HI> in the Re&s;traint of the exorbitant Power of <HI>France,</HI> and the Fate of <HI>Rome</HI> in the triumphant Con|dition of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We have now con&s;idered this Poem in its Political View, wherein we have &s;hewn that it hath two different Walks of Satyr, the one in the Story it &s;elf, which is a Ridicule on the late Tran&s;actions in general; the other in the Machinary, which is a Satyr on the Mini|&s;ters of State in particular. I &s;hall now &s;how that the &s;ame Poem, taken in another Light, has a Tendency to Popery, which is &s;ecretly in&s;inuated through the whole.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, he has conveyed to us the Doctrine of Guardian Angels and Patron Saints in the Machinary of his <HI>Sylphs,</HI> which being a
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Piece of Popi&s;h Super&s;tition that hath been endeavoured to be exploded ever &s;ince the Re|formation, he would here revive under this Di&s;gui&s;e. Here are all the Particulars which they believe of tho&s;e Beings, which I &s;hall &s;um up in a few Heads.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> The Spirits are made to concern them|&s;elves with all human Acts in general.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> A di&s;tinct Guardian Spirit or Patron is a&s;&s;igned to each Per&s;on in particular.<Q><L>Of the&s;e am I, who thy Protection claim,</L>
<L>A watchful Sprite&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> They are made directly to in&s;pire Dreams, Vi&s;ions, and Revelations.<Q><L>Her Guardian <HI>Sylph</HI> prolong'd her balmy Rest,</L>
<L>'Twas he had &s;ummon'd to her &s;ilent Bed</L>
<L>The Morning Dream&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>4<HI>thly.</HI> They are made to be &s;ubordinate, in different Degrees, &s;ome pre&s;iding over others. So <HI>Ariel</HI> hath his &s;everal Under-Officers at Command.<Q><L>Superior by the Head was <HI>Ariel</HI> plac'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>5<HI>thly.</HI> They are employed in various Offices, and each hath his Office a&s;&s;igned him.<Q><PB N="28" REF="27">
<L>Some in the Fields of purest Aether play,</L>
<L>And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Duy.</L>
<L>Some guide the Cour&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>6<HI>thly.</HI> He hath given his Spirits the Charge of the &s;everal Parts of Dre&s;s; intimating there|by, that the Saints pre&s;ide over the &s;everal Parts of Human Bodies. They have one Saint to cure the Tooth-ach, another cures the Gripes, another the Gout, and &s;o of all the re&s;t.<Q><L>The flutt'ring Fan be <HI>Zephyretta</HI>'s Care,</L>
<L>The Drops to thee, <HI>Brillante,</HI> we con&s;ign, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>7<HI>thly.</HI> They are repre&s;ented to know the Thoughts of Men.<Q><L>As on the No&s;egay in her Brea&s;t reclin'd,</L>
<L>He watch'd th' Ideas ri&s;ing in her Mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>8<HI>thly.</HI> They are made Protectors even to Animals and irrational Beings.<Q><HI>Ariel</HI> him&s;elf &s;hall be the Guard of <HI>Shock.</HI></Q> So St. <HI>Anthony</HI> pre&s;ides over Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>9<HI>thly.</HI> Others are made Patrons of whole Kingdoms and Provinces.
<Q><L>Of the&s;e the chief the Care of Nations own.</L></Q>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
So St. <HI>George</HI> is imagined by the Papi&s;ts to de|fend <HI>England;</HI> St. <HI>Patrick, Ireland;</HI> St. <HI>James, Spain,</HI> &amp;c. Now what is the Con&s;equence of all this? By granting that they have this Power, we mu&s;t be brought back again to pray to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Toilette</HI> is an artful Recommendation of the <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and pompous Ceremonies of the <HI>Church of Rome.</HI> The <HI>unveiling</HI> of the <HI>Altar,</HI> the <HI>Silver Va&s;es</HI> upon it, being <HI>rob'd</HI> in <HI>White,</HI> as the Prie&s;ts are upon the chief Fe&s;tivals, and the <HI>Head uncover'd,</HI> are manife&s;t Marks of this.
<Q><L>A heav'nly Image in the Gla&s;s appears,</L>
<L>To that &s;he bends&mdash;</L></Q>
Plainly denotes <HI>Image-Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Godde&s;s,</HI> who is deck'd with <HI>Trea&s;ures, Jewels,</HI> and the <HI>various Offerings of the World,</HI> manife&s;tly alludes to the Lady of <HI>Loretto.</HI> You have Perfumes breathing from the <HI>Incen&s;e Pot</HI> in the following Line.<Q><L>And all <HI>Arabia</HI> breaths from yonder Box.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Character of <HI>Belinda,</HI> as we take it in this third View, repre&s;ents the Popi&s;h Reli|gion, or the Whore of <HI>Babylon;</HI> who is de&s;cri|bed in the State this malevolent Author wi&s;hes for, coming forth in all her Glory upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> and over&s;preading the Nation with Ceremonies.<Q><PB N="30" REF="29">
<L>Not with more Glories in th'aetherial Plain,</L>
<L>The Sun first ri&s;es o'er the purple Main,</L>
<L>Than i&s;&s;uing forth the Rival of his Beams,</L>
<L>Launch'd on the Bo&s;om of the Silver <HI>Thames.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>She is dre&s;s'd with a <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> on her Brea&s;t, the En&s;ign of Popery, the <HI>Adoration</HI> of which is plainly recommended in the following Lines.<Q><L>On her white Breast a &s;parkling <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> &s;he wore,</L>
<L>Which Jews might <HI>ki&s;s,</HI> and Infidels <HI>adore.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Next he repre&s;ents her as the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Church,</HI> according to the Boa&s;ts of the Papi&s;ts.
<Q><L>And like the Sun &s;he &s;hines on all alike.</L></Q>
After which he tells us,
<Q><L>If to her Share &s;ome Female Errors fall,</L>
<L>Look on her Face, and you'll forget them all.</L></Q>
Tho' it &s;hould be granted &s;ome Errors fall to her &s;hare, look on the pompous Figure &s;he makes throughout the World, and they are not worth regarding. In the Sacrifice following &s;oon after, you have the&s;e two Lines. <Q><L>For this, e'er <HI>Phoebus</HI> ro&s;e, he had implor'd</L>
<L>Propitious Heav'n, and ev'ry Pow'r ador'd.</L></Q>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
In the fir&s;t of them, he plainly hints at their <HI>Matins;</HI> in the &s;econd, by adoring ev'ry Power, the <HI>Invocation of Saints.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Belinda</HI>'s Vi&s;its are de&s;cribed with numerous <HI>Wax-Lights,</HI> which are always u&s;ed in the Ce|remonial Parts of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip.<Q><L>&mdash;Vi&s;its &s;hall be paid on &s;olemn Days,</L>
<L>When num'rous Wax-lights in bright Order blaze.</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Lunar Sphere</HI> he mentions, opens to us their <HI>Purgatory,</HI> which is &s;een in the following Line. <Q><L>Since all things lo&s;t on Earth are trea&s;ur'd there.</L></Q>
It is a Popi&s;h Doctrine, that &s;carce any Per&s;on quits this World, but he mu&s;t touch at Purga|tory in his way to Heaven; and it is here al&s;o repre&s;ented as the <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI> of the <HI>Romi&s;h Church.</HI> Nor is it much to be wonder'd at, that the <HI>Moon</HI> &s;hould be <HI>Purgatory,</HI> when a Learned Divine hath in a late Treati&s;e proved <HI>Hell</HI> to be in the <HI>Sun</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Dr. <HI>Swinden.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now before I conclude, de&s;ire the Reader to compare this Key with tho&s;e upon any other Pieces, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;e|cret Satyrs upon the State, either antient or modern; as with tho&s;e upon <HI>Petronius Arbiter,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31">
<HI>Lucian</HI>'s true Hi&s;tory, <HI>Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Argenis,</HI> or <HI>Rab|lais</HI>'s <HI>Garagantua;</HI> and I doubt not he will do me the Ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that the Ex|planations here laid down, are deduced as na|turally, and with as little force, both from the general Scope and Bent of the Work, and from the &s;everal Particulars, and are every way as con&s;i&s;tent and undeniable as any of tho&s;e; and ev'ry way as candid as any modern Interpre|tations of either Party on the my&s;terious State Treati&s;es of our Times.</P>
<P>To &s;um up my whole Charge again&s;t this Author in a few Words: He has ridiculed both the pre&s;ent Mi<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry and the la&s;t; abu&s;ed great State&s;men and great Generals; nay the Trea|ties of whole Nations have not e&s;caped him, nor has the Royal Dignity it &s;elf been omitted in the Progre&s;s of his Satyr; and all this he has done ju&s;t at the Meeting of a new Parliament. I hope a proper Authority may be made u&s;e of to bring him to condign Puni&s;hment: In the mean while I doubt not if the Per&s;ons mo&s;t concern'd would but order Mr. <HI>Bernard Lin|tott,</HI> the Printer and Publi&s;her of this dange|rous Piece, to be taken into Cu&s;tody, and exa|min'd; many further Di&s;coveries might be made both of this Poet's and his Abettor's &s;e|cret De&s;igns, which are doubtle&s;s of the utmo&s;t Importance to the Government.</P>
