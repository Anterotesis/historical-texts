<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOMER is univer&s;ally allow'd to have had the greate&s;t Invention of any Writer whatever. The Prai&s;e of Judgment <HI>Vir|gil</HI> has ju&s;tly conte&s;ted with him, and others may have their Preten&s;ions as to particular Excellencies; but his Invention remains yet unrival'd. Nor is it a Wonder if he has ever been acknowledg'd the greate&s;t of Poets, who mo&s;t excell'd in That which is the very Foundation of Poetry. It is the Inven|tion that in different degrees di&s;tingui&s;hes all great Genius's: The utmo&s;t Stretch of hu|man Study, Learning, and Indu&s;try, which ma|&s;ters every thing be&s;ides, can never attain to this. It furni&s;hes Art with all her Materials, and without it Judgment it&s;elf can at be&s;t but <HI>&s;teal wi&s;ely:</HI> For Art is only like a prudent Steward that lives on managing the Riches of Nature. Whatever Prai&s;es may be given to Works of Judgment, there is not even a &s;ingle Beauty in them but is owing to the Invention: As in the mo&s;t regular Gardens, however Art may carry the greate&s;t Appearance, there is not
<PB REF="4">
a Plant or Flower but is the Gift of Nature. The fir&s;t can only reduce the Beauties of the latter into a more obvious Figure, which the common Eye may better take in, and is therefore more entertain'd with. And perhaps the rea&s;on why mo&s;t Criticks are inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical Genius to a great and fruitful one, is, becau&s;e they find it ea&s;ier for them&s;elves to pur&s;ue their Ob&s;ervations through an uniform and bounded Walk of Art, than to comprehend the va&s;t and various Extent of Nature.</P>
<P>Our Author's Work is a wild Paradi&s;e, where if we cannot &s;ee all the Beauties &s;o di&s;tinctly as in an order'd Garden, it is only becau&s;e the Num|ber of them is infinitely greater. 'Tis like a co|pious Nur&s;ery which contains the Seeds and fir&s;t Productions of every kind, out of which tho&s;e who follow'd him have but &s;elected &s;ome parti|cular Plants, each according to his Fancy, to cul|tivate and beautify. If &s;ome things are too luxu|riant, it is owing to the Richne&s;s of the Soil; and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or Ma|turity, it is only becau&s;e they are over-run and oppre&s;t by tho&s;e of a &s;tronger Nature.</P>
<P>It is to the Strength of this amazing Inven|tion we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and Rapture, which is &s;o forcible in <HI>Homer,</HI> that no Man of a true Poetical Spirit is Ma&s;ter of him|&s;elf while he reads him. What he writes is of the mo&s;t animated Nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in
<PB REF="5">
Action. If a Council be call'd, or a Battel fought, you are not coldly inform'd of what was &s;aid or done as from a third Per&s;on; the Reader is hur|ry'd out of him&s;elf by the Force of the Poet's Imagination, and turns in one place to a Hearer, in another to a Spectator. The Cour&s;e of his Ver&s;es re&s;embles that of the Army he de&s;cribes,<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></Q> <HI>They pour along like a Fire that &s;weeps the whole Earth before it.</HI> 'Tis however remarkable that his Fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not di&s;cover'd immediately at the beginning of his Poem in its fulle&s;t Splendor: It grows in the Progre&s;s both upon him&s;elf and others, and be|comes on Fire like a Chariot-Wheel, by its own Rapidity. Exact Di&s;po&s;ition, ju&s;t Thought, cor|rect Elocution, poli&s;h'd Numbers, may have been found in a thou&s;and; but this Poetical <HI>Fire,</HI> this <HI>Vivida vis animi,</HI> in a very few. Even in Works where all tho&s;e are imperfect or neglected, this can over-power Critici&s;m, and make us admire even while we di&s;-approve. Nay, where this appears, tho' attended with Ab&s;urdities, it brigh|tens all the Rubbi&s;h about it, 'till we &s;ee nothing but its own Splendor. This <HI>Fire</HI> is di&s;cern'd in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but di&s;cern'd as through a Gla&s;s, refle|cted, and more &s;hining than warm, but every where equal and con&s;tant: In <HI>Lucan</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> it bur&s;ts out in &s;udden, &s;hort, and interrupted Fla&s;hes: In <HI>Milton,</HI> it glows like a Furnace kept
<PB REF="6">
up to an uncommon Fiercene&s;s by the Force of Art: In <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> it &s;trikes before we are aware, like an accidental Fire from Heaven: But in <HI>Homer,</HI> and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irre&s;i&s;tibly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here endeavour to &s;how, how this va&s;t <HI>Invention</HI> exerts it&s;elf in a manner &s;uperior to that of any Poet, thro' all the main con&s;tituent Parts of his Work, as it is the great and peculiar Cha|racteri&s;tick which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from all other Authors.</P>
<P>This &s;trong and ruling Faculty was like a powerful Planet, which in the Violence of its Cour&s;e, drew all things within its <HI>Vortex.</HI> It &s;eem'd not enough to have taken in the whole Circle of Arts, and the whole Compa&s;s of Na|ture; all the inward Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of Mankind to &s;upply this Characters, and all the outward Forms and Images of Things for his De&s;criptions; but wanting yet an ampler Sphere to expatiate in, he open'd a new and boundle&s;s Walk for his Imagination, and created a World for him&s;elf in the Invention of <HI>Fable.</HI> That which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls the <HI>Soul of Poetry,</HI> was fir&s;t breath'd into it by <HI>Homer.</HI> I &s;hall begin with con&s;idering him in this Part, as it is naturally the fir&s;t, and I &s;peak of it both as it means the De&s;ign of a Poem, and as it is taken for Fiction.</P>
<P>Fable may be divided into the <HI>Probable,</HI> the <HI>Allegorical,</HI> and the <HI>Marvelous.</HI> The <HI>Probable</HI>
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Fable</HI> is the Recital of &s;uch Actions as tho' they did not happen, yet might, in the com|mon cour&s;e of Nature: Or of &s;uch as tho' they did, become Fables by the additional Epi&s;odes and manner of telling them. Of this &s;ort is the main Story of an Epic Poem, <HI>the Return of</HI> Uly&s;&s;es, <HI>the Settlement of the</HI> Trojans <HI>in</HI> Italy, or the like. That of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is <HI>the Anger of</HI> Achilles, the mo&s;t &s;hort and &s;ingle Subject that ever was cho&s;en by any Poet. Yet this he has &s;upplied with a va&s;ter Variety of In|cidents and Events, and crouded with a greater Number of Councils, Speeches, Battles, and Epi|&s;odes of all kinds, than are to be found even in tho&s;e Poems who&s;e Schemes are of the utmo&s;t Latitude and Irregularity. The Action is hurry'd on with the mo&s;t vehement Spirit, and its whole Duration employs not &s;o much as fifty Days. <HI>Virgil,</HI> for want of &s;o warm a Genius, aided him&s;elf by taking in a more exten&s;ive Subject, as well as a greater Length of Time, and con|tracting the De&s;ign of both <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic Poets have us'd the &s;ame Practice, but generally carry'd it &s;o far as to &s;uperinduce a Multiplicity of Fables, de&s;troy the Unity of Action, and lo&s;e their Readers in an unrea&s;onable Length of Time. Nor is it only in the main De&s;ign that they have been unable to add to his Invention, but they have follow'd him in every Epi&s;ode and Part of Story. If he has
<PB REF="8">
given a regular <HI>Catalogue</HI> of an <HI>Army,</HI> they all draw up their Forces in the &s;ame Order. If he has funeral Games for <HI>Patroclus, Virgil</HI> has the &s;ame for <HI>Anchi&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Statius</HI> (rather than omit them) de&s;troys the Unity of his Action for tho&s;e of <HI>Archemorus.</HI> If <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> vi&s;it the Shades, the <HI>Aeneas</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI> of <HI>Silius</HI> are &s;ent after him. If he be detain'd from his Return by the Allurements of <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> &s;o is <HI>Aeneas</HI> by <HI>Dido,</HI> and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> by <HI>Armida.</HI> If <HI>Achilles</HI> be ab&s;ent from the Army on the Score of a Quarrel thro' half the Poem, <HI>Rinaldo</HI> mu&s;t ab&s;ent him|&s;elf ju&s;t as long, on the like account. If he gives his Heroe a Suit of cele&s;tial Armour, <HI>Vir|gil</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> make the &s;ame Pre&s;ent to theirs. <HI>Virgil</HI> has not only ob&s;erv'd this clo&s;e Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> but where he had not led the way, &s;upply'd the Want from other <HI>Greek</HI> Authors. Thus the Story of <HI>Sinon</HI> and the <HI>Taking of Troy</HI> was copied (&s;ays <HI>Macrobius</HI>) almo&s;t word for word from <HI>Pi&s;ander,</HI> as the Loves of <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> are taken from tho&s;e of <HI>Medaea</HI> and <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> in <HI>Apollonius,</HI> and &s;everal others in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>To proceed to the <HI>Allegorical Fable:</HI> If we reflect upon tho&s;e innumerable Knowledges, tho&s;e Secrets of Nature and Phy&s;ical Philo&s;ophy which <HI>Homer</HI> is generally &s;uppos'd to have wrapt up in his <HI>Allegories,</HI> what a new and ample Scene of Wonder may this Con&s;ideration afford us? How fertile will that Imagination appear, which was
<PB REF="9">
able to cloath all the Properties of Elements, the Qualifications of the Mind, the Virtues and Vices, in Forms and Per&s;ons; and to introduce them into Actions agreeable to the Nature of the Things they &s;hadow'd? This is a Field in which no &s;uc|ceeding Poets could di&s;pute with <HI>Homer;</HI> and whatever Commendations have been allow'd them on this Head, are by no means for their Invention in having enlarg'd his Circle, but for their Judg|ment in having contracted it. For when the Mode of Learning chang'd in following Ages, and Science was deliver'd in a plainer manner, it then became as rea&s;onable in the more modern Poets to lay it a&s;ide, as it was in <HI>Homer</HI> to make u&s;e of it. And perhaps it was no un|happy Circum&s;tance for <HI>Virgil,</HI> that there was not in his Time that Demand upon him of &s;o great an Invention, as might be capable of fur|ni&s;hing all tho&s;e Allegorical Parts of a Poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marvelous Fable</HI> includes whatever is &s;u|pernatural, and e&s;pecially the Machines of the Gods. If <HI>Homer</HI> was not the fir&s;t who introduc'd the Deities (as <HI>Herodotus</HI> imagines) into the Re|ligion of <HI>Greece,</HI> he &s;eems the fir&s;t who brought them into a Sy&s;tem of <HI>Machinery</HI> for Poetry, and &s;uch an one as makes its greate&s;t Importance and Dignity. For we find tho&s;e Authors who have been offended at the literal Notion of the Gods, con&s;tantly laying their Accu&s;ation again&s;t <HI>Homer</HI> as the undoubted Inventor of them. But whatever cau&s;e there might be to blame his <HI>Ma|chines</HI>
<PB REF="10">
in a Philo&s;ophical or Religious View, they are &s;o perfect in the Poetick, that Mankind have been ever &s;ince contented to follow them: None have been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Limits he has &s;et: Every Attempt of this Nature has prov'd un&s;ucce&s;sful; and after all the various Changes of Times and Religions, his Gods continue to this Day the Gods of Poetry.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Characters</HI> of his Per&s;ons, and here we &s;hall find no Author has ever drawn &s;o many with &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;urprizing a Variety, or given us &s;uch lively and affecting Impre&s;&s;ions of them. Every one has &s;omething &s;o &s;ingularly his own, that no Painter could have di&s;tingui&s;h'd them more by their Features, than the Poet has by their Manners. Nothing can be more exact than the Di&s;tinctions he has ob&s;erv'd in the diffe|rent degrees of Virtues and Vices. The &s;ingle Quality of <HI>Courage</HI> is wonderfully diver&s;ify'd in the &s;everal Characters of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> That of <HI>Achilles</HI> is furious and intractable; that of <HI>Diomede</HI> forward, yet li&s;tening to Advice and &s;ubject to Command: We &s;ee in <HI>Ajax</HI> an heavy and &s;elf|con&s;idering Valour, in <HI>Hector</HI> an active and vigi|lant one: The Courage of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is in&s;pi|rited by Love of Empire and Ambition, that of <HI>Menelaus</HI> mix'd with Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s for his People: We find in <HI>Idomeneus</HI> a plain direct Soldier, in <HI>Sarpedon</HI> a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and a&s;toni&s;hing Diver&s;ity to
<PB REF="11">
be found only in the principal Quality which con|&s;titutes the Main of each Character, but even in the Under-parts of it, to which he takes care to give a Tincture of that principal one. For Ex|ample, the main Characters of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and they are di&s;tinct in this; the Wi&s;dom of one is <HI>artificial</HI> and <HI>various,</HI> of the other <HI>natural, open,</HI> and <HI>regular.</HI> But they have, be&s;ides, Characters of <HI>Courage;</HI> and this Quality al&s;o takes a different Turn in each from the dif|ference of his Prudence: For one in the War de|pends &s;till upon <HI>Caution,</HI> the other upon <HI>Expe|rience.</HI> It would be endle&s;s to produce In&s;tances of the&s;e Kinds. The Characters of <HI>Virgil</HI> are far from &s;triking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undi&s;tingui&s;h'd, and where they are mark'd mo&s;t evidently, affect us not in proportion to tho&s;e of <HI>Homer.</HI> His Cha|racters of Valour are much alike; even that of <HI>Turnus</HI> &s;eems no way peculiar but as it is in a &s;uperior degree; and we &s;ee nothing that diffe|rences the Courage of <HI>Mne&s;theus</HI> from that of <HI>Ser|ge&s;thus, Cloanthus,</HI> or the re&s;t. In like manner it may be remark'd of <HI>Statius</HI>'s Heroes, that an Air of Impetuo&s;ity runs thro' them all; the &s;ame hor|rid and &s;avage Courage appears in his <HI>Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon,</HI> &amp;c. They have a Parity of Character which makes them &s;eem Brothers of one Family. I believe when the Reader is led into this Track of Reflection, if he will pur&s;ue it through the <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> Writers, he will be convinced
<PB REF="12">
how infinitely &s;uperior in this Point the Invention of <HI>Homer</HI> was to that of all others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Speeches</HI> are to be con&s;ider'd as they &s;low from the Characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or di&s;agree with the Manners of tho&s;e who utter them. As there is more variety of Characters in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> &s;o there is of Speeches, than in any other Poem. <HI>Every thing in it has Manners</HI> (as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) that is, every thing is acted or &s;poken. It is hardly credible in a Work of &s;uch length, how &s;mall a Number of Lines are employ'd in Narration. In <HI>Virgil</HI> the Dramatic Part is le&s;s in proportion to the Narrative; and the Speeches often con&s;i&s;t of ge|neral Reflections or Thoughts, which might be equally ju&s;t in any Per&s;on's Mouth upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion. As many of his Per&s;ons have no ap|parent Characters, &s;o many of his Speeches e&s;cape being apply'd and judg'd by the Rule of Propriety. We oftner think of the Author him&s;elf when we read <HI>Virgil,</HI> than when we are engag'd in <HI>Homer:</HI> All which are the Effects of a colder Invention, that intere&s;ts us le&s;s in the Action de&s;crib'd: <HI>Homer</HI> makes us Hearers, and <HI>Virgil</HI> leaves us Readers.</P>
<P>If in the next place we take a View of the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> the &s;ame pre&s;iding Faculty is eminent in the Sublimity and Spirit of his Thoughts. <HI>Longinus</HI> has given his Opinion, that it was in this Part <HI>Homer</HI> principally excell'd. What were alone &s;ufficient to prove the Grandeur and Excellence of his Sentiments in general, is that
<PB REF="13">
they have &s;o remarkable a Parity with tho&s;e of the Scripture: <HI>Duport,</HI> in his <HI>Gnomologia Homerica,</HI> has collected innumerable In&s;tances of this &s;ort. And it is with Ju&s;tice an excellent modern Writer allows, that if <HI>Virgil</HI> has not &s;o many Thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not &s;o many that are &s;ublime and noble; and that the <HI>Roman</HI> Author &s;eldom ri&s;es into very a&s;toni&s;hing Senti|ments where he is not fired by the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>If we ob&s;erve his <HI>De&s;criptions, Images,</HI> and <HI>Si|miles,</HI> we &s;hall find the Invention &s;till predomi|nant. To what el&s;e can we a&s;cribe that va&s;t Comprehen&s;ion of Images of every &s;ort, where we &s;ee each Circum&s;tance and Individual of Na|ture &s;ummon'd together by the Extent and Fe|cundity of his Imagination; to which all things, in their various Views, pre&s;ented them&s;elves in an In&s;tant, and had their Impre&s;&s;ions taken off to Perfection at a Heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full Pro&s;pects of Things, but &s;everal un|expected Peculiarities and Side-Views, unob&s;erv'd by any Painter but <HI>Homer.</HI> Nothing is &s;o &s;ur|prizing as the De&s;criptions of his Battels, which take up no le&s;s than half the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and are &s;up|ply'd with &s;o va&s;t a Variety of Incidents, that no one bears a Likene&s;s to another; &s;uch different Kinds of Deaths, that no two Heroes are wounded in the &s;ame manner; and &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of no|ble Ideas, that every Battel ri&s;es above the la&s;t in Greatne&s;s, Horror, and Confu&s;ion. It is certain there is not near that Number of Images and
<PB REF="14">
De&s;criptions in any Epic Poet; tho' every one has a&s;&s;i&s;ted him&s;elf with a great Quantity out of him: And it is evident of <HI>Virgil</HI> e&s;pecially, that he has &s;carce any Compari&s;ons which are not drawn from his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>If we de&s;cend from hence to the <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> we &s;ee the bright Imagination of <HI>Homer</HI> &s;hining out in the mo&s;t enliven'd Forms of it. We acknow|ledge him the Father of Poetical Diction, the fir&s;t who taught that <HI>Language of the Gods</HI> to Men. His Expre&s;&s;ion is like the colouring of &s;ome great Ma&s;ters, which di&s;covers it&s;elf to be laid on boldly, and executed with Rapidity. It is indeed the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t glowing imagi|nable, and touch'd with the greate&s;t Spirit. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had rea&s;on to &s;ay, He was the only Poet who had found out <HI>Living Words;</HI> there are in him more daring Figures and Metaphors than in any good Author whatever. An Arrow is <HI>impatient</HI> to be on the Wing, a Weapon <HI>thir&s;ts</HI> to drink the Blood of an Enemy, and the like. Yet his Expre&s;&s;ion is never too big for the Sen&s;e, but ju&s;tly great in proportion to it: 'Tis the Senti|ment that &s;wells and fills out the Diction, which ri&s;es with it, and forms it&s;elf about it. For in the &s;ame degree that a <HI>Thought</HI> is warmer, an <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> will be brighter; and as That is more &s;trong, This will become more per&s;picuous: Like Gla&s;s in the Furnace which grows to a greater Magnitude, and refines to a greater Clearne&s;s, only as the <HI>Breath</HI> within is more powerful, and the <HI>Heat</HI> more inten&s;e.</P>
<P><PB REF="15">
To throw his Language more out of Pro&s;e, <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems to have affected the <HI>Compound-Epi|thets.</HI> This was a &s;ort of Compo&s;ition peculiarly proper to Poetry, not only as it heighten'd the <HI>Diction,</HI> but as it a&s;&s;i&s;ted and fill'd the <HI>Numbers</HI> with greater Sound and Pomp, and likewi&s;e con|duced in &s;ome mea&s;ure to thicken the <HI>Images.</HI> On this la&s;t Con&s;ideration I cannot but attribute the&s;e to the Fruitfulne&s;s of his Invention, &s;ince (as he has manag'd them) they are a &s;ort of &s;upernu|merary Pictures of the Per&s;ons or Things they are join'd to. We &s;ee the Motion of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Plumes in the Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, the Land&s;cape of Mount <HI>Neritus</HI> in that of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;o of others; which particular Images could not have been in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;o long as to expre&s;s them in a De&s;cription (tho' but of a &s;ingle Line) without diverting the Reader too much from the prin|cipal Action or Figure. As a Metaphor is a &s;hort Simile, one of the&s;e Epithets is a &s;hort De&s;cription.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if we con&s;ider his <HI>Ver&s;ification,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible what a Share of Prai&s;e is due to his Invention in that al&s;o. He was not &s;atisfy'd with his Language as he found it &s;ettled in any one Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> but &s;earch'd thro' its differ|ing <HI>Dialects</HI> with this particular View, to beau|tify and perfect his Numbers: He con&s;ider'd the&s;e as they had a greater Mixture of Vowels or Con&s;onants, and accordingly employ'd them as the Ver&s;e requir'd either a greater Smoothne&s;s
<PB REF="16">
or Strength. What he mo&s;t affected was the <HI>Ionic,</HI> which has a peculiar Sweetne&s;s from its never u&s;ing Contractions, and from its Cu&s;tom of re&s;olving the Diphthongs into two Syllables; &s;o as to make the Words open them&s;elves with a more &s;preading and &s;onorous Fluency. With this he mingled the <HI>Attic</HI> Contractions, the broader <HI>Doric,</HI> and the feebler <HI>Aeolic,</HI> which often rejects its A&s;pirate, or takes off its Accent; and compleated this Variety by altering &s;ome Letters with the Licen&s;e of Poetry. Thus his Mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of being Fetters to his Sen&s;e, were always in readi|ne&s;s to run along with the Warmth of his Rap|ture; and even to give a farther Repre&s;entation of his Notions, in the Corre&s;pondence of their Sounds to what they &s;ignify'd. Out of all the&s;e he has deriv'd that Harmony, which makes us confe&s;s he had not only the riche&s;t Head, but the fine&s;t Ear in the World. This is &s;o great a Truth, that whoever will but con&s;ult the Tune of his Ver&s;es even without under&s;tanding them (with the &s;ame &s;ort of Diligence as we daily &s;ee practis'd in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Italian Opera's</HI>) will find more Sweetne&s;s, Variety, and Maje&s;ty of Sound, than in any other Language or Poetry. The Beauty of his Numbers is allow'd by the Criticks to be copied but faintly by <HI>Virgil</HI> him&s;elf, tho' they are &s;o ju&s;t to a&s;cribe it to the Nature of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue. Indeed the <HI>Greek</HI> has &s;ome Advantages both from the natural <HI>Sound</HI> of its <HI>Words,</HI> and the Turn and <HI>Cadence</HI> of its <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> which agree
<PB REF="17">
with the Genius of no other Language. <HI>Virgil</HI> was very &s;en&s;ible of this, and u&s;ed the utmo&s;t Diligence in working up a more intractable Lan|guage to what&s;oever Graces it was capable of, and in particular never fail'd to bring the Sound of his Line to a beautiful Agreement with its Sen&s;e. If the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet has not been &s;o frequently ce|lebrated on this Account as the <HI>Roman,</HI> the only rea&s;on is, that fewer Criticks have under&s;tood one Language than the other. <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicar|na&s;&s;us</HI> has pointed out many of our Author's Beau|ties in this kind, in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Compo&s;ition of Words,</HI> and others will be taken notice of in the Cour&s;e of the Notes. It &s;uffices at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve of his Numbers, that they flow with &s;o much ea&s;e, as to make one imagine <HI>Homer</HI> had no other care than to tran&s;cribe as fa&s;t as the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> dictated; and at the &s;ame time with &s;o much Force and in&s;piriting Vigour, that they awaken and rai&s;e us like the Sound of a Trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful River, always in motion, and always full; while we are born away by a Tide of Ver&s;e, the mo&s;t rapid, and yet the mo&s;t &s;mooth imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus on whatever &s;ide we contemplate <HI>Homer,</HI> what principally &s;trikes us is his <HI>Invention.</HI> It is that which forms the Character of each Part of his Work; and accordingly we find it to have made his Fable more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>copious</HI> than any other, his Manners more <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>&s;trongly marked,</HI> his Speeches more <HI>affecting</HI> and <HI>tran&s;ported,</HI>
<PB REF="18">
his Sentiments more <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> his Ima|ges and De&s;criptions more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> his Expre&s;&s;ion more <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>daring,</HI> and his Numbers more <HI>rapid</HI> and <HI>various.</HI> I hope in what has been &s;aid of <HI>Virgil</HI> with regard to any of the&s;e Heads, I have no way derogated from his Character. Nothing is more ab&s;urd or end|le&s;s, than the common Method of comparing eminent Writers by an Oppo&s;ition of particular Pa&s;&s;ages in them, and forming a Judgment from thence of their Merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain Knowledge of the prin|cipal Character and di&s;tingui&s;hing Excellence of each: It is in <HI>that</HI> we are to con&s;ider him, and in proportion to his Degree in <HI>that</HI> we are to ad|mire him. No Author or Man ever excell'd all the World in more than one Faculty, and as <HI>Homer</HI> has done this in Invention, <HI>Virgil</HI> has in Judgment. Not that we are to think <HI>Homer</HI> wanted Judgment, becau&s;e <HI>Virgil</HI> had it in a more eminent degree; or that <HI>Virgil</HI> wanted In|vention, becau&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t a larger &s;hare of it: Each of the&s;e great Authors had more of both than perhaps any Man be&s;ides, and are only &s;aid to have le&s;s in Compari&s;on with one ano|ther. <HI>Homer</HI> was the greater Genius, <HI>Virgil</HI> the better Arti&s;t. In one we mo&s;t admire the <HI>Man,</HI> in the other the <HI>Work. Homer</HI> hurries and tran&s;|ports us with a commanding Impetuo&s;ity, <HI>Virgil</HI> leads us with an attractive Maje&s;ty: <HI>Homer</HI> &s;catters with a generous Profu&s;ion, <HI>Virgil</HI> be&s;tows
<PB REF="19">
with a careful Magnificence: <HI>Homer,</HI> like the <HI>Nile,</HI> pours out his Riches with a &s;udden Overflow; <HI>Virgil</HI> like a River in its Banks, with a gentle and con&s;tant Stream. When we behold their Battels, methinks the two Poets re&s;emble the He|roes they celebrate: <HI>Homer,</HI> boundle&s;s and irre&s;i|&s;tible as <HI>Achilles,</HI> bears all before him, and &s;hines more and more as the Tumult increa&s;es; <HI>Virgil,</HI> calmly daring like <HI>Aeneas,</HI> appears undi&s;turb'd in the mid&s;t of the Action, di&s;po&s;es all about him, and conquers with Tranquillity: And when we look upon their Machines, <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems like his own <HI>Jupiter</HI> in his Terrors, &s;haking <HI>Olympus,</HI> &s;cat|tering the Lightnings, and firing the Heavens; <HI>Virgil,</HI> like the &s;ame Power in his Benevolence, coun&s;elling with the Gods, laying Plans for Em|pires, and regularly ordering his whole Creation.</P>
<P>But after all, it is with great Parts as with great Virtues, they naturally border on &s;ome Im|perfection; and it is often hard to di&s;tingui&s;h exactly where the Virtue ends, or the Fault be|gins. As Prudence may &s;ometimes &s;ink to Su&s;|picion, &s;o may a great Judgment decline to Coldne&s;s; and as Magnanimity may run up to Profu&s;ion or Extravagance, &s;o may a great Inven|tion to Redundancy or Wildne&s;s. If we look upon <HI>Homer</HI> in this View, we &s;hall perceive the chief <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t him to proceed from &s;o noble a Cau&s;e as the Exce&s;s of this Faculty.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e we may reckon &s;ome of his <HI>Mar|vellous Fictions,</HI> upon which &s;o much Critici&s;m
<PB REF="20">
has been &s;pent as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the Bounds of Probability. Perhaps it may be with great and &s;uperior Souls as with gigantick Bodies, which ex|erting them&s;elves with unu&s;ual Strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due Proportion of Parts, to become Miracles in the whole; and like the old Heroes of that Make, commit &s;ome|thing near Extravagance amid&s;t a Series of glo|rious and inimitable Performances. Thus <HI>Homer</HI> has his <HI>&s;peaking Hor&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> his <HI>Myrtles di&s;tilling Blood,</HI> without &s;o much as contriving the ea&s;y Intervention of a Deity to &s;ave the Probability.</P>
<P>It is owing to the &s;ame va&s;t Invention that his <HI>Similes</HI> have been thought too exuberant and full of Circum&s;tances. The Force of this Faculty is &s;een in nothing more, than its In|ability to confine it&s;elf to that &s;ingle Circum|&s;tance upon which the Compari&s;on is grounded: It runs out into Embelli&s;hments of additional Images, which however are &s;o manag'd as not to overpower the main one. His Similes are like Pictures, where the principal Figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the Original, but is al&s;o &s;et off with occa&s;ional Ornaments and Pro&s;pects. The &s;ame will account for his man|ner of heaping a Number of Compari&s;ons toge|ther in one Breath, when his Fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to him at once &s;o many various and corre&s;pondent Images. The Reader will ea&s;ily extend this Ob|&s;ervation to more Objections of the &s;ame kind.</P>

If there are others which &s;eem rather to charge him with a Defect or Narrowne&s;s of Genius, than an Exce&s;s of it; tho&s;e &s;eeming Defects will be found upon Examination to proceed wholly from the Nature of the Times he liv'd in. Such are his <HI>gro&s;&s;er Repre&s;entations</HI> of the <HI>Gods,</HI> and the vicious and <HI>imperfect Manners</HI> of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> which will be treated of in the following <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Articles of</HI> Theology <HI>and</HI> Morality, <HI>in the third Part of the</HI> E&s;&s;ay.</NOTE><HI>E&s;&s;ay:</HI> But I mu&s;t here &s;peak a word of the latter, as it is a Point generally carry'd into Extreams both by the Cen&s;urers and Defenders of <HI>Homer.</HI> It mu&s;t be a &s;trange Partiality to Antiquity to think with Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Preface to her</HI> Homer.</NOTE> tho&s;e Times and Man|ners are &s;o much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours"</Q> Who can be &s;o preju|diced in their Favour as to magnify the Felicity of tho&s;e Ages, when a Spirit of Revenge and Cruelty reign'd thro' the World, when no Mercy was &s;hown but for the &s;ake of Lucre, when the greate&s;t Princes were put to the Sword, and their Wives and Daughters made Slaves and Concu|bines? On the other &s;ide I would not be &s;o deli|cate as tho&s;e modern Criticks, who are &s;hock'd at the <HI>&s;ervile Offices</HI> and <HI>mean Employments</HI> in which we &s;ometimes &s;ee the Heroes of <HI>Homer</HI> en|gag'd. There is a Plea&s;ure in taking a view of that Simplicity in Oppo&s;ition to the Luxury of &s;ucceeding Ages; in beholding Monarchs without their Guards, Princes tending their Flocks, and
<PB REF="22">
Prince&s;&s;es drawing Water from the Springs. When we read <HI>Homer,</HI> we ought to reflect that we are reading the mo&s;t ancient Author in the Heathen World; and tho&s;e who con&s;ider him in this Light, will double their Plea&s;ure in the Peru&s;al of him. Let them think they are growing ac|quainted with Nations and People that are now no more; that they are &s;tepping almo&s;t three thou&s;and Years backward into the remote&s;t An|tiquity, and entertaining them&s;elves with a clear and &s;urprizing Vi&s;ion of Things no where el&s;e to be found, and the only authentick Picture of that ancient World. By this means alone their greate&s;t Ob&s;tacles will vani&s;h; and what u&s;ually creates their Di&s;like, will become a Sa|tisfaction.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration may farther &s;erve to an|&s;wer for the con&s;tant U&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>Epithets</HI> to his Gods and Heroes, &s;uch as the <HI>far-darting Phoebus,</HI> the <HI>blue-ey'd Pallas,</HI> the <HI>&s;wift-footed Achilles,</HI> &amp;c. which &s;ome have cen&s;ured as im|pertinent and tediou&s;ly repeated. Tho&s;e of the Gods depended upon the Powers and Offices then believ'd to belong to them, and had contracted a Weight and Veneration from the Rites and &s;o|lemn Devotions in which they were us'd: They were a &s;ort of Attributes that it was a Matter of Religion to &s;alute them with on all Occa&s;ions, and an Irreverence to omit. As for the Epithets of great Men, Mon&s;. <HI>Boileau</HI> is of Opinion; that they were in the Nature of <HI>Surnames,</HI> and re|peated
<PB REF="23">
as &s;uch; for the <HI>Greeks</HI> having no Names deriv'd from their Fathers, were oblig'd when they mention'd any one to add &s;ome other Di|&s;tinction; either naming his Parents expre&s;sly, or his Place of Birth, Profe&s;&s;ion, or the like: As <HI>Alexander</HI> Son of <HI>Philip, Herodotus</HI> of <HI>Halicar|na&s;&s;us, Diogenes</HI> the <HI>Cynic, &amp;c. Homer</HI> therefore complying with the Cu&s;tom of his Countrey, us'd &s;uch di&s;tinctive Additions as better agreed with Poetry. And indeed we have &s;omething parallel to the&s;e in modern Times, &s;uch as the Names of <HI>Harold Harefoot, Edmund Iron|&s;ide, Edward Long-&s;hanks, Edward</HI> the <HI>black Prince, &amp;c.</HI> If yet this be thought to account better for the Propriety than for the Repetition, I &s;hall add a farther Conjecture. <HI>He&s;iod</HI> dividing the World into its Ages, has plac'd a fourth Age between the Brazen and the Iron one, of <HI>Heroes di&s;tinct from other Men, a divine Race, who fought at</HI> Thebes <HI>and</HI> Troy, <HI>are called Demi-Gods, and live by the Care of</HI> Jupiter <HI>in the I&s;lands of the Ble&s;&s;ed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He&s;iod, <HI>lib.</HI> 1. &vers;. 155, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Now among the divine Honours which were paid them, they might have this al&s;o in common with the Gods, not to be mention'd without the Solemnity of an Epithet, and &s;uch as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their Families, Actions, or Qualities.</P>
<P>What other Cavils have been rais'd again&s;t <HI>Homer</HI> are &s;uch as hardly de&s;erve a Reply, but
<PB REF="24">
will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the Cour&s;e of the Work. Many have been occa&s;ion'd by an injudicious Endeavour to exalt <HI>Virgil;</HI> which is much the &s;ame, as if one &s;hould think to prai&s;e the Super&s;tructure by undermining the Foundation: One would imagine by the whole Cour&s;e of their Parallels, that the&s;e Criticks never &s;o much as heard of <HI>Homer</HI>'s having written fir&s;t; a Con&s;ideration which whoever compares the&s;e two Poets ought to have always in his Eye. Some accu&s;e him for the &s;ame things which they overlook or prai&s;e in the other; as when they prefer the Fable and Moral of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> to tho&s;e of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons which might &s;et the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI> above the <HI>Aeneis:</HI> as that the He|roe is a wi&s;er Man; and the Action of the one more beneficial to his Countrey than that of the other: Or el&s;e they blame him for not doing what he never de&s;ign'd; as becau&s;e <HI>Achilles</HI> is not as good and perfect a Prince as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> when the very Moral of his Poem requir'd a contrary Character. It is thus that <HI>Rapin</HI> judges in his Compari&s;on of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> Others &s;elect tho&s;e particular Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Homer</HI> which are not &s;o labour'd as &s;ome that <HI>Virgil</HI> drew out of them: This is the whole Management of <HI>Scaliger</HI> in his <HI>Poetices.</HI> Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ometimes thro' a fal&s;e Deli|cacy and Refinement, oftner from an Ignorance of the Graces of the Original; and then tri|umph in the Aukwardne&s;s of their own Tran&s;|lations.
<PB REF="25">
This is the Conduct of <HI>Perault</HI> in his <HI>Parallels.</HI> La&s;tly, there are others, who pretend|ing to a fairer Proceeding, di&s;tingui&s;h between the per&s;onal Merit of <HI>Homer,</HI> and that of his <HI>Work;</HI> but when they come to a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;es of the great Reputation of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> they found it upon the Ignorance of his Times, and the Prejudice of tho&s;e that followed. And in pur&s;uance of this Principle, they make tho&s;e Accidents (&s;uch as the Contention of the Cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) to be the Cau&s;es of his Fame, which were in Reality the Con&s;equences of his Merit. The &s;ame might as well be &s;aid of <HI>Virgil,</HI> or any great Author, who&s;e general Character will infallibly rai&s;e many ca&s;ual Ad|ditions to their Reputation. This is the Method of Mon&s;. <HI>de la Motte;</HI> who yet confe&s;&s;es upon the whole, that in whatever Age <HI>Homer</HI> had liv'd he mu&s;t have been the greate&s;t Poet of his Na|tion, and that he may be &s;aid in this Sen&s;e to be the Ma&s;ter even of tho&s;e who &s;urpa&s;s'd him.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Objections we &s;ee nothing that contradicts his Title to the Honour of the chief <HI>Invention;</HI> and as long as this (which is indeed the Characteri&s;tic of Poetry it&s;elf) remains une|qual'd by his Followers, he &s;till continues &s;uperior to them. A cooler Judgment may commit fewer Faults, and be more approv'd in the Eves of <HI>One Sort</HI> of Criticks: but that Warmth of Fancy will carry the loude&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al Applau&s;es which holds the Heart of a Reader under the &s;tronge&s;t Enchantment. <HI>Homer</HI> not only appears
<PB REF="26">
the Inventor of Poetry, but excells all the Inven|tors of other Arts in this, that he has &s;wallow'd up the Honour of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him. What he has done admitted no Encrea&s;e, it on|ly le&s;t room for Contraction or Regulation. He &s;hew'd all the Stretch of Fancy at once; and if he has fail'd in &s;ome of his Flights, it was but be|cau&s;e he attempted every thing. A Work of this kind &s;eems like a mighty Tree which ri&s;es from the mo&s;t vigorous Seed, is improv'd with Indu&s;try, flouri&s;hes, and produces the fine&s;t Fruit; Nature and Art have con&s;pir'd to rai&s;e it; Plea&s;ure and Profit join'd to make it valuable: and they who find the ju&s;te&s;t Faults, have only &s;aid, that a few Branches (which run luxuriant thro' a Richne&s;s of Nature) might be lopp'd into Form to give it a more regular Appearance.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of the Beauties and De|fects of the Original, it remains to treat of the Tran&s;lation, with the &s;ame View to the chief Characteri&s;tic. As far as that is &s;een in the main Parts of the Poem, &s;uch as the <HI>Fable, Manners,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> no Tran&s;lator can prejudice it but by wilful Omi&s;&s;ions or Contractions. As it al&s;o breaks out in every particular <HI>Image, De&s;cription,</HI> and <HI>Simile;</HI> whoever le&s;&s;ens or too much &s;oftens tho&s;e, takes off from this chief Character. It is the fir&s;t grand Duty of an Interpreter to give his Author entire and unmaim'd; and for the re&s;t, the <HI>Diction</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;ification</HI> only are his
<PB REF="27">
proper Province; &s;ince the&s;e mu&s;t be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</P>
<P>It &s;hould then be con&s;ider'd what Methods may afford &s;ome Equivalent in our Language for the Graces of the&s;e in the <HI>Greek.</HI> It is certain no literal Tran&s;lation can be ju&s;t to an excellent Original in a &s;uperior Language: but it is a great Mi|&s;take to imagine (as many have done) that a ra&s;h Paraphra&s;e can make amends for this ge|neral Defect; which is no le&s;s in danger to lo&s;e the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expre&s;&s;ion. If there be &s;ome|times a <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> there is often a <HI>Light</HI> in Anti|quity, which nothing better pre&s;erves than a Ver|&s;ion almo&s;t literal. I know no Liberties one ought to take, but tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;|fu&s;ing the Spirit of the Original, and &s;upporting the Poetical Style of the Tran&s;lation: and I will venture to &s;ay, there have not been more Men mi&s;led in former times by a &s;ervile dull Adhe|rence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical in&s;olent Hope of rai&s;ing and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Poem is what a Tran&s;lator &s;hould principally regard, as it is mo&s;t likely to expire in his managing: However it is his &s;afe&s;t way to be content with pre&s;erving this to his utmo&s;t in the Whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in Writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical
<PB REF="28">
and figurative; and it is what <HI>Homer</HI> will teach us if we will but follow mode&s;tly in his Foot|&s;teps. Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us rai&s;e ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of incurring the Cen&s;ure of a meer <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems to have been more com|monly mi&s;taken than the ju&s;t Pitch of his Style: Some of his Tran&s;lators having &s;well'd into Fu&s;|tian in a proud Confidence of the <HI>Sublime;</HI> others &s;unk into Flatne&s;s in a cold and timorous Notion of <HI>Simplicity.</HI> Methinks I &s;ee the&s;e different Fol|lowers of <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ome &s;weating and &s;training after him by violent Leaps and Bounds, (the cer|tain Signs of fal&s;e Mettle) others &s;lowly and &s;er|vilely creeping in his Train, while the Poet him|&s;elf is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal Maje&s;ty before them. However of the two Extreams one could &s;ooner pardon Frenzy than Frigidity: No Author is to be envy'd for &s;uch Commendations as he may gain by that Cha|racter of Style, which his Friends mu&s;t agree together to call <HI>Simplicity,</HI> and the re&s;t of the World will call <HI>Dulne&s;s.</HI> There is a <HI>graceful</HI> and <HI>dignify'd</HI> Simplicity, as well as a <HI>bald</HI> and <HI>&s;ordid</HI> one, which differ as much from each other as the Air of a <HI>plain</HI> Man from that of a <HI>Sloven:</HI> 'Tis one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dre&s;s'd at all. Simplicity is the Mean between O&s;tentation and Ru&s;ticity.</P>
<P><PB REF="29">
This pure and noble Simplicity is no where in &s;uch Perfection as in the <HI>Scripture</HI> and our Author. One may affirm with all re&s;pect to the in&s;pired Writings, that the <HI>Divine Spirit</HI> made u&s;e of no other Words but what were intelligi|ble and common to Men at that Time, and in that Part of the World; and as <HI>Homer</HI> is the Au|thor neare&s;t to tho&s;e, his Style mu&s;t of cour&s;e bear a greater Re&s;emblance to the &s;acred Books than that of any other Writer. This Con&s;idera|tion (together with what has been ob&s;erv'd of the Parity of &s;ome of his Thoughts) may methinks induce a Tran&s;lator on the one hand to give into &s;everal of tho&s;e general Phra&s;es and Man|ners of Expre&s;&s;ion, which have attain'd a Vene|ration even in our Language from their u&s;e in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament;</HI> as on the other, to avoid tho&s;e which have been appropriated to the Divi|nity, and in a manner con&s;ign'd to My&s;tery and Religion.</P>
<P>For a farther Pre&s;ervation of this Air of Sim|plicity, a particular Care &s;hould be taken to ex|pre&s;s with all Plainne&s;s tho&s;e <HI>Moral Sentences</HI> and <HI>Proverbial Speeches</HI> which are &s;o numerous in this Poet.

For Example, the Epithet of <HI>Apollo,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>far-&s;hooting,</HI> is capable of two Explica|tions; one literal in re&s;pect of the Darts and Bow, the En&s;igns of that God; the other allego|rical with regard to the Rays of the Sun: There|fore in &s;uch Places where <HI>Apollo</HI> is repre&s;ented as a God in Per&s;on, I would u&s;e the former Inter|pretation, and where the Effects of the Sun are de&s;crib'd, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to avoid that perpetual Repetition of the &s;ame Epithets which we find in <HI>Homer,</HI> and which, tho' it might be accommodated (as has been already &s;hewn) to the Ear of tho&s;e Times, is by no means &s;o to ours: But one may wait for Opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional Beauty from the Occa&s;ions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a Tran&s;lator may at once &s;hew his Fancy and his Judgment.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Repetitions;</HI> we may divide them into three &s;orts; of whole Narrations and
<PB REF="34">
Speeches, of &s;ingle Sentences, and of one Ver&s;e or Hemi&s;tich. I hope it is not impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;uch a Regard to the&s;e, as neither to lo&s;e &s;o known a Mark of the Author on the one hand, nor to offend the Reader too much on the other. The Repetition is not ungraceful in tho&s;e Speeches where the Dignity of the Speaker renders it a &s;ort of In&s;olence to alter his Words; as in the Me&s;&s;a|ges from Gods to Men, or from higher Powers to Inferiors in Concerns of State, or where the Ceremonial of Religion &s;eems to require it, in the &s;olemn Forms of Prayers, Oaths, or the like. In other Ca&s;es, I believe the be&s;t Rule is to be guided by the Nearne&s;s, or Di&s;tance, at which the Repe|titions are plac'd in the Original: When they follow too clo&s;e one may vary the Expre&s;&s;ion, but it is a Que&s;tion whether a profe&s;s'd Tran&s;la|tor be authorized to omit any: If they be tedi|ous, the Author is to an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>It only remains to &s;peak of the <HI>Ver&s;ification. Homer</HI> (as has been &s;aid) is perpetually applying the Sound to the Sen&s;e, and varying it on every new Subject. This is indeed one of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite Beauties of Poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of <HI>Homer</HI> eminent for it in the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> in <HI>Latine.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible it is what may &s;ometimes happen by Chance, when a Writer is warm, and fully po&s;&s;e&s;t of his Image: however it may be rea&s;onably believed they de|&s;ign'd this, in who&s;e Ver&s;e it &s;o manife&s;tly ap|pears in a &s;uperior degree to all others. Few
<PB REF="35">
Readers have the Ear to be Judges of it, but tho&s;e who have will &s;ee I have endeavour'd at this Beauty.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf ut|terly incapable of doing Ju&s;tice to <HI>Homer.</HI> I at|tempt him in no other Hope but that which one may entertain without much Vanity, of giving a more tolerable Copy of him than any entire Tran&s;|lation in Ver&s;e has yet done. We have only tho&s;e of <HI>Chapman, Hobbes,</HI> and <HI>Ogilby. Chapman</HI> has ta|ken the Advantage of an immea&s;urable Length of Ver&s;e, notwith&s;tanding which there is &s;carce any Paraphra&s;e more loo&s;e and rambling than his. He has frequent Interpolations of four or &s;ix Lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth Book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es, ver.</HI> 312. where he has &s;pun twenty Ver&s;es out of two. He is often mi&s;taken in &s;o bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpo&s;e, if he did not in other Places of his Notes in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon Verbal Trifles. He appears to have had a &s;trong Affectation of extracting new Meanings out of his Author, in&s;omuch as to promi&s;e in his Rhyming Preface, a Poem of the My&s;teries he had revealed in <HI>Homer;</HI> and perhaps he endeavoured to &s;train the obvious Sen&s;e to this End. His Expre&s;&s;ion is involved in Fu&s;tian, a Fault for which he was remarkable in his Original Writings, as in the Tragedy of <HI>Bu&s;&s;yd' Amboi&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. In a word, the Nature of the Man may account for his whole Performance; for he appears from his Preface and Remarks to have been of an ar|rogant
<PB REF="36">
Turn, and an Enthu&s;ia&s;t in Poetry. His own Boa&s;t of having fini&s;h'd half the <HI>Iliad</HI> in le&s;s than fifteen Weeks, &s;hews with what Negli|gence his Ver&s;ion was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contri|buted to cover his Defects, is a daring fiery Spirit that animates his Tran&s;lation, which is &s;omething like what one might imagine <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf would have writ before he arriv'd to Years of Di&s;cretion. <HI>Hobbes</HI> has given us a correct Explanation of the Sen&s;e in general, but for Particulars and Circum|&s;tances he continually lopps them, and often omits the mo&s;t beautiful. As for its being e&s;teem'd a clo&s;e Tran&s;lation, I doubt not many have been led into that Error by the Shortne&s;s of it, which proceeds not from his following the Original Line by Line, but from the Contractions above-men|tioned. He &s;ometimes omits whole Similes and Sentences, and is now and then guilty of Mi|&s;takes which no Writer of his Learning could have fallen into, but thro' Carele&s;ne&s;s. His Poe|try, as well as <HI>Ogilby</HI>'s, is too mean for Critici&s;m.</P>
<P>It is a great Lo&s;s to the Poetical World that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> did not live to tran&s;late the <HI>Iliad.</HI> He has left us only the fir&s;t Book and a &s;mall Part of the &s;ixth; in which if he has in &s;ome Places not truly interpreted the Sen&s;e, or pre&s;erved the Antiquities, it ought to be excu&s;ed on account of the Ha&s;te he was obliged to write in. He &s;eems to have had too much Regard to <HI>Chapman,</HI> who&s;e Words he &s;ometimes copies, and has unhappily
<PB REF="37">
follow'd him in Pa&s;&s;ages where he wanders from the Original. However had he tran&s;lated the whole Work, I would no more have attempted <HI>Homer</HI> after him than <HI>Virgil,</HI> his Ver&s;ion of whom (notwith&s;tanding &s;ome human Errors) is the mo&s;t noble and &s;pirited Tran&s;lation I know in any Lan|guage. But the Fate of great Genius's is like that of great Mini&s;ters, tho' they are confe&s;&s;edly the fir&s;t in the Commonwealth of Letters, they mu&s;t be envy'd and calumniated only for being at the Head of it.</P>
<P>That which in my Opinion ought to be the Endeavour of any one who tran&s;lates <HI>Homer,</HI> is above all things to keep alive that Spirit and Fire which makes his chief Character. In particular Places, where the Sen&s;e can bear any Doubt, to follow the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t Poetical, as mo&s;t agreeing with that Character. To copy him in all the Variations of his Style, and the different Modulations of his Numbers. To pre&s;erve in the more active or de&s;criptive Parts, a Warmth and Elevation; in the more &s;edate or narrative, a Plainne&s;s and Solemnity; in the Speeches a Ful|ne&s;s and Per&s;picuity; in the Sentences a Shortne&s;s and Gravity. Not to neglect even the little Figures and Turns on the Words, nor &s;ome|times the very Ca&s;t of the Periods. Neither to omit or confound any Rites or Cu&s;toms of Antiquity. Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a &s;horter Compa&s;s, than has hitherto been done by any Tran&s;lator who has tolerably
<PB REF="38">
pre&s;erved either the Sen&s;e or Poetry. What I would farther recommend to him, is to &s;tudy his Author rather from his own Text than from any Commentaries, how learned &s;oever, or whatever Figure they make in the E&s;timation of the World. To con&s;ider him attentively in Compari&s;on with <HI>Virgil</HI> above all the Ancients, and with <HI>Milton</HI> above all the Moderns. Next the&s;e the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s <HI>Telemachus</HI> may give him the true&s;t Idea of the Spirit and Turn of our Author, and <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>'s admirable Treati&s;e of the Epic Poem the ju&s;te&s;t Notion of his De&s;ign and Conduct. But after all, with whatever Judgment and Study a Man may proceed, or with whatever Happine&s;s he may perform &s;uch a Work; he mu&s;t hope to plea&s;e but a few, tho&s;e only who have at once a Ta&s;te of Poetry, and competent Learning. For to &s;atisfy &s;uch as want either, is not in the Nature of this Undertaking; &s;ince a meer Modern Wit can like nothing that is not <HI>Modern,</HI> and a Pedant nothing that is not <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>What I have done is &s;ubmitted to the Publick, from who&s;e Opinions I am prepared to learn; tho' I fear no Judges &s;o little as our be&s;t Poets, who are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the Weight of this Task. As for the wor&s;t, whatever they &s;hall plea&s;e to &s;ay, they may give me &s;ome Concern as they are unhappy Men, but none as they are malignant Writers. I was guided in this Tran&s;lation by Judgments very different from theirs, and by Per|&s;ons for whom they can have no Kindne&s;s, if an
<PB REF="39">
old Ob&s;ervation be true, that the &s;tronge&s;t Anti|pathy in the World is that of Fools to Men of Wit. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was the fir&s;t who&s;e Advice deter|min'd me to undertake this Task, who was pleas'd to write to me upon that Occa&s;ion in &s;uch Terms as I cannot repeat without Vanity. I was obliged to Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> for a very early Recommen|dation of my Undertaking to the Publick. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> promoted my Intere&s;t with that Warmth with which he always &s;erves his Friend. The Humanity and Frankne&s;s of Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> are what I never knew wanting on any Occa&s;ion. I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge with infinite Plea&s;ure the many friendly Offices as well as &s;incere Cri|tici&s;ms of Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> who had led me the way in tran&s;lating &s;ome Parts of <HI>Homer,</HI> as I wi&s;h for the &s;ake of the World he had prevented me in the re&s;t. I mu&s;t add the Names of Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> and Dr. <HI>Parnell,</HI> tho' I &s;hall take a farther Opportunity of doing Ju&s;tice to the la&s;t, who&s;e Good-nature (to give it a great Panegyrick) is no le&s;s exten&s;ive than his Learning. The Favour of the&s;e Gentlemen is not entirely unde&s;erved by one who bears them &s;o true an Affection. But what can I &s;ay of the Honour &s;o many of the <HI>Great</HI> have done me, while the <HI>Fir&s;t Names</HI> of the Age appear as my Sub&s;cribers, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd Patrons and Ornaments of Learning as my chief Encouragers. Among the&s;e it is a particular Plea&s;ure to me to find, that my highe&s;t Obligations are to &s;uch who have done mo&s;t Ho|nour

And that &s;o excellent an Imitator of <HI>Homer</HI> as the no|ble Author of the Tragedy of <HI>Heroic Love,</HI> has continu'd his Partiality to me from my writing Pa&s;torals to my attempting the <HI>Iliad.</HI> I cannot deny my &s;elf the Pride of confe&s;&s;ing, that I have had the Advantage not only of their Advice for the Conduct in general, but their Correction of &s;everal Particulars of this Tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay a great deal of the Plea&s;ure of be|ing di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> but it is almo&s;t ab&s;urd to particularize any one gene|rous

Action in a Per&s;on who&s;e whole Life is a continued Series of them. The Right Honoura|ble Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> the pre&s;ent Secretary of State, will pardon my De&s;ire of having it known that he was pleas'd to promote this Affair. The par|ticular Zeal of Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> (the Son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a Proof how much I am honour'd in a Share of his Friend&s;hip. I mu&s;t attribute to the &s;ame Motive that of &s;everal others of my Friends, to whom all Acknowledgments are render'd unnece&s;&s;ary by the Privileges of a fa|miliar Corre&s;pondence: And I am &s;atisfy'd I can no way better oblige Men of their Turn, than by my Silence.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have found more Patrons than ever <HI>Homer</HI> wanted. He would have thought him&s;elf happy to have met the &s;ame Favour at <HI>Athens,</HI> that has been &s;hewn me by its learned Rival, the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI> If my Author had the <HI>Wits</HI> of After-Ages for his Defenders, his Tran&s;|lator has had the <HI>Beauties</HI> of the pre&s;ent for his Advocates; a Plea&s;ure too great to be changed for any Fame in Rever&s;ion. And I can hardly envy him tho&s;e pompous Honours he receiv'd af|ter Death, when I reflect on the Enjoyment of &s;o many agreeable Obligations, and ea&s;y Friend&s;hips which make the Satisfaction of Life. This Di|&s;tinction is the more to be acknowledg'd, as it is &s;hewn to one who&s;e Pen has never gratify'd the Prejudices of particular <HI>Parties,</HI> or the Vanities of particular <HI>Men.</HI> Whatever the Succe&s;s may
<PB REF="42">
prove, I &s;hall never repent of an Undertaking in which I have experienc'd the Candour and Friend&s;hip of &s;o many Per&s;ons of Merit; and in which I hope to pa&s;s &s;ome of tho&s;e Years of Youth that are generally lo&s;t in a Circle of Fol|lies, after a manner neither wholly unu&s;eful to others, nor di&s;agreeable to my &s;elf.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;omething in the Mind of Man, which goes beyond bare Curio&s;ity, and even carries us on to a Shadow of Friend&s;hip with tho&s;e great Genius's whom we have known to excel in former Ages. Nor will it appear le&s;s to any one, who con&s;iders how much it par|takes of the Nature of Friend&s;hip; how it compounds it&s;elf of an Admiration rais'd by what we meet with concerning them; a Tendency to be farther acquainted with them, by gathering every Circum&s;tance of their Lives; a kind of Complacency in their Company, when we retire to enjoy what they have left; an Union with them in tho&s;e Sentiments they approve; and an En|deavour to defend them, when we think they are injuriou&s;ly at|tack'd, or even &s;ometimes with too partial an Affection.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o in Mankind a Spirit of Envy or Oppo&s;ition, which makes them unea&s;y to &s;ee others of the &s;ame Species
<PB N="2" REF="47">
&s;eated far above them in a &s;ort of Perfection. And this, at lea&s;t &s;o far as we &s;peak of the Fame of Writers, has not always been known to dye with a Man entirely, but to pur&s;ue his Re|mains with idle Traditions, and weak Conjectures; &s;o that his Name, which is not to be forgotten, &s;hall be pre&s;erv'd only to be &s;tain'd and blotted. The Controver&s;y, which was carry'd on between the Author and his Enemies, while he yet was living, &s;hall &s;till be kept on foot; not entirely upon his own account, but on theirs who live after him; &s;ome being fond to prai&s;e extravagantly, and others as ra&s;hly eager to contradict his Ad|mirers. This Proceeding, on both &s;ides, gives us an Image of the fir&s;t De&s;criptions of War, &s;uch as the <HI>Iliad</HI> affords; where a Heroe di&s;putes the Field with an Army 'til it is his time to dye, and then the Battel, which we expected to fall of cour&s;e, is renew'd about the Body; his Friends contending that they may embalm and honour it, his Enemies that they may ca&s;t it to the Dogs and Vultures.</P>
<P>There are yet others of a low kind of Ta&s;te, who, without any Malignity to the Character of a great Author, le&s;&s;en the Dignity of their Subject by in&s;i&s;ting too meanly upon little Particularities. They imagine it the Part of an Hi&s;torian to omit nothing they meet concerning him whom they write upon; and gather every thing wherein he is nam'd, without any di&s;tinction, to the Prejudice or Neglect of the more noble Parts of his Character: Like tho&s;e trifling Painters, or Sculptors, who be|&s;tow infinite Pains and Patience upon the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Parts of a Figure, 'till they &s;ink the Grandeur of the Whole, by fini&s;hing every thing with the neate&s;t Want of Judgment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a fourth &s;ort of Men, who pretend to dive&s;t them&s;elves of impetuous Emotions on both &s;ides, and to get above that imperfect Idea of their Subject, which little Writers fall into; who propo&s;e to them&s;elves a calm Search after Truth, and a rational Adherence to Probability in their hi&s;torical Collections: Who neither wi&s;h to be led into the Fa|bles of Poetry, nor are willing to &s;upport the Fal&s;ehoods of a malignant Critici&s;m; but, endeavouring to &s;teer in a middle way, have obtain'd a Character of failing lea&s;t in the Choice of Ma|terials for Hi&s;tory, even from the darke&s;t Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="48">
Being therefore to write &s;omething concerning a Life, which there is little Pro&s;pect of our knowing, after it has been the fruitle&s;s Enquiry of &s;o many Ages, and which has however been thus differently treated by Hi&s;torians, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak of it, not as a Certainty, but as the Tradition, Opinion, or Collection of Authors, who have been &s;uppos'd to write of <HI>Homer</HI> in the&s;e four preceding Methods, to which we &s;hall al&s;o add &s;ome farther Conjectures of our own. After his Life has been thus rather &s;poken of than di&s;cover'd, I &s;hall con&s;ider him hi&s;torically as an Author, with regard to tho&s;e Works which he has left behind him: In doing which, we may trace the degrees of E&s;teem they have obtain'd in different Periods of Time, and regulate our pre&s;ent Opinion of them, by a View of that Age in which they were written.</P>

The Mind, that becomes dazled with the Sight of his Performances, lo&s;es the common Idea of a Man in the fan&s;y'd Splendor of Per|fection: It &s;ees nothing le&s;s than a God worthy to be his Fa|ther, nothing le&s;s than a Prophete&s;s de&s;erving to be his Nur&s;e, and, growing unwilling that he &s;hould be &s;poken of in a Lan|guage beneath its Imaginations, delivers Fables in the place of Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>Here we behold a wonderful Genealogy contriv'd indu&s;triou&s;ly to rai&s;e our Idea to the highe&s;t, where Gods, Godde&s;&s;es, Mu&s;es, Kings, and Poets link in a de&s;cent; nay, where Poets are made to depend, as it were, in Clu&s;ters upon the &s;ame Stalk beneath one another. If we con&s;ider too that <HI>Har|monides</HI> is deriv'd from Harmony, <HI>Philoterpus</HI> from love of De|light, <HI>Euphemus</HI> from beautiful Diction, <HI>Epiphrades</HI> from In|telligence, and <HI>Pucamede</HI> from Prudence; it may not be im|probable, but the Inventors meant, by a Fiction of this Nature, to turn &s;uch Qualifications into Per&s;ons as were agreeable to his Character, for whom the Line was drawn: So that every thing, Divine or Great, will thus come together by the extra|vagant Indulgence of Fancy, while it turns it&s;elf &s;ometimes to Admiration, and &s;ometimes to Allegory.</P>
<P>After this fabulous Tree of his Pedigree, we may regularly view him in one Pa&s;&s;age concerning his Birth, which, though it differs in a Circum&s;tance from what has been here deliver'd, yet carries on the &s;ame Air, and regards the &s;ame Traditions. There is a &s;hort Life of <HI>Homer</HI> attributed to <HI>Plutarch,</HI> wherein a third part of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> on Poetry, which is now lo&s;t, is quoted for an account of his uncommon Birth, in this manner. <Q REND="inline">"At the time when <HI>Neleus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Codrus,</HI> led the Colony which was &s;ent into <HI>Ionia,</HI> there was in the I&s;land of <HI>Io</HI> a young Girl, compre&s;s'd by a <HI>Genius,</HI> who delighted to a&s;&s;o|ciate with the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> and &s;hare in their Con&s;orts. She, finding
<PB N="6" REF="51">
her&s;elf with Child, and being touch'd with the Shame of what had happen'd to her, remov'd from thence to a Place call'd <HI>Aegina.</HI> There &s;he was taken in an Excur&s;ion made by Robbers, and being brought to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which was then un|der the <HI>Lydians,</HI> they gave her to <HI>Maeon</HI> the King, who mar|ry'd her upon account of her Beauty. But while &s;he walk'd on the Bank of the River <HI>Meles,</HI> &s;he brought forth <HI>Homer</HI> and expir'd. The Infant was taken by <HI>Maeon,</HI> and bred up as his Son, 'till the Death of that Prince."</Q> And from this Point of the Story the Poet is let down into his traditional Poverty. Here we &s;ee, tho' he be taken out of the Lineage of <HI>Meles</HI> where we met him before, he has &s;till as wonderful a Ri&s;e in|vented for him; he is &s;till to &s;pring from a <HI>Demigod,</HI> one who was of a Poetical Di&s;po&s;ition, from whom he might inherit a Soul turn'd to Poetry, and receive an A&s;&s;i&s;tance of heavenly In&s;piration.</P>
<P>In his Life the mo&s;t general Tradition concerning him is his <HI>Blindne&s;s,</HI> yet there are &s;ome who will not allow even this to have happen'd after the manner in which it falls upon other Men: Chance and Sickne&s;s are excluded; nothing le&s;s than Gods and Heroes mu&s;t be vi&s;ibly concern'd about him. Thus we find among the different Accounts which <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hermias <HI>in Phaed. Plat.</HI> Leo Allat. <HI>de Patr. Hom. C.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE><HI>Hermias</HI> has collected concerning his Blindne&s;s, that when <HI>Homer</HI> re&s;olv'd to write of <HI>Achilles,</HI> he had an exceeding De&s;ire to fill his Mind with a ju&s;t Idea of &s;o glorious a Heroe: Wherefore, having paid all due Honours at his Tomb, he intreats that he may obtain a &s;ight of him. The Heroe grants his Poet's Petition, and ri&s;es in a glorious Suit of Armour, which ca&s;t &s;o un&s;ufferable a Splen|dor, that <HI>Homer</HI> lo&s;t his Eyes, while he gaz'd for the Enlarge|ment of his Notions.</P>
<P>If this be any thing more than a meer Fable, one would be apt to imagine it in&s;inuated his contracting a Blindne&s;s by too inten&s;e an Application while he wrote his <HI>Iliad.</HI> But it is a very pompous way of letting us into the Knowledge of &s;o &s;hort a Truth: It looks as if Men imagin'd the Lives of Poets &s;hould be Poetically written; that to &s;peak plainly of them, were to &s;peak contemptibly; or that we deba&s;e them, when they are

Such Stories as the&s;e have been the Effects of a &s;uper&s;ti|tious Fondne&s;s, and of our A&s;toni&s;hment at what we con&s;ider in a View of Perfection. But neither have all Men the &s;ame Ta&s;te, nor do they equally &s;ubmit to the Superiority of others, nor bear that human Nature, which they know to be imperfect, &s;hould be prais'd in an Extream without oppo&s;ition. From &s;ome Principles of this kind have ari&s;en a &s;econd &s;ort of Stories, which glance at <HI>Homer</HI> with malignant Suppo&s;itions, and endeavour to throw a dimini&s;hing Air over his Life, as a kind of An&s;wer to tho&s;e who &s;ought to aggrandize him injudiciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Under this Head we may reckon tho&s;e ungrounded Conjectures with which his Adver&s;aries a&s;per&s;e the very De&s;ign and Pro&s;ecution of his Travels, when they in&s;inuate, that they were one continued Search after Authors who had written before him, and particularly upon the &s;ame Subject, in order to de&s;troy them, or to rob them of their Inventions.</P>
<P>Thus we read in <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Diod.

<P><PB N="8" REF="53">
The next In&s;inuation we hear is from <HI>Suidas,</HI> that <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who fought at <HI>Troy,</HI> was famous for Poetry, and wrote concern|ing that War in the <HI>Dorick</HI> Letter which he invented, proba|bly much again&s;t <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> his mortal Enemies.

<P>After him, in the order of time, we meet with a whole Set of Names, to whom the Maligners of <HI>Homer</HI> would have him oblig'd, without being able to prove their A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>Suidas</HI> mentions <HI>Corinnus Ilien&s;is,</HI> the Secretary of <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who writ a Poem upon the &s;ame Subject, but no one is produc'd as having &s;een it. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tzetzes <HI>Chil.</HI> 5. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> 29.</NOTE><HI>Tzetzes</HI> mentions (and from <HI>Johannes Melala</HI> only) <HI>Si&s;yphus</HI> the <HI>Coan,</HI> Secretary of <HI>Teucer,</HI> but it is not &s;o much as known if he writ Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e.

<P>Towards the latter end of his Life, there is another Story invented, which makes him conclude it in a manner alto|gether beneath the Greatne&s;s of a Genius.

<P><HI>Homer</HI> was born at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> about one hundred &s;ixty eight Years after the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and &s;ix hundred twenty two Years before the <HI>Expedition</HI> of <HI>Xerxes.</HI> His Mother's Name was <HI>Crytheis,</HI> who proving unlawfully with Child, was &s;ent away from <HI>Cumae</HI> by her Uncle, with <HI>I&s;menias,</HI> one of tho&s;e who led the Colony to <HI>Smyrna</HI> then building. A while after, as &s;he was celebrating a Fe&s;tival with other Women on the Banks of the River <HI>Meles,</HI> &s;he was deliver'd of <HI>Homer,</HI> whom &s;he therefore nam'd <HI>Mele&s;igenes.</HI> Upon this &s;he left <HI>I&s;menias,</HI> and &s;upported her&s;elf by Working, 'til <HI>Phemius</HI> (who taught a School in <HI>Smyrna</HI>) fell in love with her, and marry'd her. But both dying in proce&s;s of Time, the School fell to <HI>Homer,</HI> who manag'd it with &s;uch Wi&s;dom, that he was univer&s;ally admir'd both by Natives and Strangers. Among&s;t the&s;e latter was <HI>Mentes,</HI> a Ma&s;ter of a Ship from <HI>Leucadia,</HI> by who&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions and Pro|mi&s;es he gave up his School, and went to travel: With him he vi&s;ited <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but was left behind at <HI>Ithaca</HI> upon ac|count of a Defluxion in his Eyes. During his Stay he was en|tertain'd by one <HI>Mentor,</HI> a Man of Fortune, Ju&s;tice, and Ho&s;pi|tality, and learn'd the principal Incidents of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>'s Life. But at the Return of <HI>Mentes,</HI> he went from thence to <HI>Colophon,</HI> where, his Defluxion renewing, he fell entirely blind. Upon this he could think of no better Expedient than to go back to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where perhaps he might be &s;upported by tho&s;e who knew him, and have the lei&s;ure to addict him&s;elf to Poetry. But there he found his Poverty encrea&s;e, and his hopes of En|couragement fail; &s;o that he remov'd for <HI>Cumae,</HI> and by the way was entertain'd for &s;ome time at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Tychius</HI> a Leather-Dre&s;&s;er. At <HI>Cumae</HI> his Poems were wonderfully admir'd, but when he propos'd to eternize their Town if they would al|low him a Sallary, he was an&s;wer'd, That there would be no end of maintaining all the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>blind Men,</HI> and hence he got the Name of <HI>Homer.</HI> From <HI>Cumae</HI> he went to <HI>Phocaea,</HI> where one <HI>The&s;torides</HI> (a School-ma&s;ter al&s;o) offer'd to maintain him if he would &s;uffer him to tran&s;cribe his Ver&s;es: This <HI>Homer</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="59">
complying with for meer Nece&s;&s;ity, the other had no &s;ooner gotten them, but he remov'd to <HI>Chois;</HI> There the Poems gain'd him Wealth and Honour, while the Author him&s;elf hardly earn'd his Bread by repeating them. At la&s;t, &s;ome who came from <HI>Chios</HI> having told the People that the &s;ame Ver&s;es were publi&s;h'd there by a School-ma&s;ter, <HI>Homer</HI> re&s;olv'd to find him out. Having therefore landed near that Place, he was receiv'd by one <HI>Glaucus</HI> a Shepherd (at who&s;e Door he had like to have been worried by Dogs) and carry'd by him to his Ma&s;ter at <HI>Bolli&s;&s;us,</HI> who admi|ring his Knowledge, entru&s;ted him with the Education of his Children. Here his Prai&s;e began to &s;pread, and <HI>The&s;torides,</HI> who heard of his Neighbourhood, fled before him. He remov'd however &s;ome time afterwards to <HI>Chois,</HI> where he &s;et up a School of Poetry, gain'd a competent Fortune, marry'd a Wife, and had two Daughters, the one of which dy'd young, the other was marry'd to his Patron at <HI>Bolli&s;&s;us.</HI> Here he in&s;erted in his Poems the Names of tho&s;e to whom he had been mo&s;t oblig'd, as, <HI>Mentes, Phemius, Mentor,</HI> and <HI>Tychius:</HI> and re&s;olving for <HI>Athens,</HI> he made honourable mention of that City, to prepare the <HI>Athe|nians</HI> for a kind Reception. But as he went, the Ship put in at <HI>Samos,</HI> where he continu'd the whole Winter, &s;inging at the Hou&s;es of great Men, with a Train of Boys after him. In Spring he went on board again in order to pro&s;ecute his Journey to <HI>Athens,</HI> but landing by the way at <HI>Ios,</HI> he fell &s;ick, dy'd, and was bury'd on the Sea-Shore.</P>
<P>This is the Life of <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;crib'd to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> tho' it is wonderful it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;ince it evidently contradicts his own <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> by placing <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ix hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of <HI>Xerxes;</HI> whereas <HI>Herodotus</HI> him&s;elf, who was alive at the time of that Expedition, &s;ays <HI>Homer</HI> was only <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>l.</HI> 2.</NOTE>four hundred Years before him. However, if we can imagin that there may be any thing of Truth in the main Parts of this Treati&s;e, we may gather the&s;e general Ob&s;ervations from it: That he &s;hew'd a great Thir&s;t of Knowledge, by undertaking &s;uch long and numerous Travels; That he manife&s;ted an un|exampled Vigor of Mind, by being able to write with more Fire under the Di&s;advantages of Blindne&s;s, and the utmo&s;t Poverty,
<PB N="15" REF="60">
than any Poet after him in better Circum&s;tances; And that he had an unlimited Sen&s;e of Fame (the Attendant of noble Spirits) which prompted him to engage in new Travels, both under the&s;e Di&s;advantages, and the additional Burthen of old Age.</P>
<P>But it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make &s;ome Conjectures, which &s;eem to lay open the Foundation from whence the Traditions which frame the low Lives of <HI>Homer</HI> have ari&s;en. In the fir&s;t place we may con&s;ider, That there are no Hi&s;torians of his Time (or none handed down to us) who have mention'd him; and that he has never &s;poken plainly of him&s;elf, in tho&s;e Works which have been a&s;crib'd to him without Controver&s;y. However, an eager De&s;ire to know &s;omething concerning him has occa&s;ion'd Mankind to labour the Point under the&s;e Di&s;advantages, and turn on all Hands to &s;ee if there were any thing left which might have the lea&s;t Appearance of Information. Upon the Search, they find no Remains but his <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> and re&s;olve to torture the&s;e upon the Rack of Invention, in order to give &s;ome account of the Per&s;on they belong to.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing therefore they &s;ettle is, That what pa&s;s'd for his <HI>Name,</HI> mu&s;t be his <HI>Name</HI> no longer, but an <HI>additional Title</HI> us'd in&s;tead of it. The rea&s;on why it was given, mu&s;t be &s;ome Accident of his Life. Having thus found an end of the Clue, they proceed to con&s;ider every thing that the word may imply by its Derivation. One finds that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ignifies a <HI>Thigh;</HI> whence ari&s;es the Tradition in <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hel. <HI>l.</HI> 3.</NOTE><HI>Heliodorus,</HI> that he was bani&s;h'd <HI>Aegypt</HI> for the Mark on that Part, which &s;hew'd a &s;purious Birth; and this they imagine ground enough to give him the Life of a Wanderer. A &s;econd finds that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ignifies an <HI>Ho&s;tage,</HI> and then he mu&s;t be deliver'd as &s;uch in a War (ac|cording to <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Proc. <HI>vis.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Proclus</HI>) between <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Chios.</HI> A third can derive the Name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>non videns,</HI> from whence he mu&s;t be a <HI>blind Man</HI> (as in the Piece a&s;crib'd to <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Herodotus.</HI>) A fourth brings him from <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>&s;peaking</HI> in <HI>Council;</HI> and then (as it is in <HI>Suidas</HI>) he mu&s;t, by a divine In&s;piration, de|clare to the <HI>Smyrnaeans,</HI> that they &s;hould war again&s;t <HI>Colophon.</HI> A fifth finds the word may be brought to &s;ignify <HI>following others,</HI>

or <HI>joining him&s;elf</HI> to them, and then he mu&s;t be call'd <HI>Homer</HI> for &s;aying (as it is quoted from <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in the Life a&s;crib'd to <HI>Plutarch</HI>) that he would <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <HI>follow</HI> the <HI>Lydians</HI> from <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Thus has the Name been turn'd and winded enough at lea&s;t to give a Su&s;picion, that he who got a <HI>new Etymology,</HI> got a handle either for a <HI>new Life</HI> of him, or &s;omething which he added to the old one.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Name</HI> it&s;elf not affording enough to furni&s;h out a whole Life, his <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t be brought in for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and it is taken for granted, That where he has not &s;poken of him|&s;elf, he lies veil'd beneath the Per&s;ons or Actions of tho&s;e whom he de&s;cribes. Becau&s;e he calls a Poet by the Name of <HI>Phemius</HI> in his <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> they conclude this <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Phemius</HI> was his Ma&s;ter.

If <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> be &s;et upon by Dogs at his Shepherd's Cottage, becau&s;e this is a low Adventure, it is thought to be his own at <HI>Bolli&s;&s;us.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>And if he calls the Leather-dre&s;&s;er, who made <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Shield, by the Name of <HI>Tychius,</HI> he has been &s;upported by &s;uch an one in his Wants: Nay, &s;ome have been &s;o vio|lently carry'd into this way of conjecturing, that the bare <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.

Thus he is &s;till imagin'd to intend him&s;elf; and the Fictions of Poetry, converted into real Facts, are deliver'd for his Life, who has a&s;&s;ign'd them to others. All tho&s;e Sto|ries in his Works which &s;uit with a mean Condition are &s;uppos'd to have happen'd to him, tho' the &s;ame way of Inference might as well prove him to have acted in a higher Sphere, from the many Pa&s;&s;ages that &s;hew his Skill in Government, and his Knowledge of the great Parts of Life.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other &s;catter'd Stories of <HI>Homer</HI> which fall not under the&s;e Heads, but are however of as trifling a Nature; as much unfit for the Materials of Hi&s;tory, &s;till more unground|ed, if po&s;&s;ible, and ari&s;ing merely from Chance, or the Hu|mours of Men: Such is the Report we meet with from <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Diogenes Lacrtius <HI>ex</HI> Heracl. <HI>in vita</HI> Socratis.</NOTE><HI>Hera|clides,</HI>

<P>As <HI>Greece</HI> was in all Probability his native Country, and had then began to make an Effort for Learning, we cannot doubt but he travel'd there al&s;o, with a particular Ob&s;ervation. He u&s;es the different <HI>Dialects</HI> which were &s;poken in its different Parts, as one who had been conver&s;ant with them all. But the Argu|ment which appears mo&s;t irrefragable, is to be taken from his <HI>Ca|talogue</HI> of the <HI>Ships:</HI> He has there given us an exact <HI>Geography</HI> of <HI>Greece;</HI> where its Cities, Mountains, and Plains, are parti|cularly mention'd; where the Cour&s;es of its Rivers are trac'd out; where the Countrys are laid in order, their Bounds a&s;&s;ign'd, and the u&s;es of their Soils &s;pecify'd; which the An|cients, who compar'd it with the Original, have allow'd to be &s;o true in all Points, that it could never have been owing to a loo&s;e and ca&s;ual Information. Even <HI>Strabo</HI>'s Account of <HI>Greece</HI> is but a kind of Commentary upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s.</P>
<P>We may carry this Argument farther, to &s;uppo&s;e his having been round <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> from his exact Divi&s;ion of the <HI>Regnum Priami vetus</HI> (as <HI>Horace</HI> calls it) into its &s;eparate <HI>Dyna&s;ties,</HI> and the Account he gives of the bordering Nations in Alliance with it. Perhaps too, in the Wandrings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> about <HI>Sicily,</HI> who&s;e Ports and neighbouring I&s;lands are mention'd, he might con|trive to &s;end his Heroe where he had made his own Voyage before. Nor will the Fables he has intermingled be any Obje|ction to his having travel'd in tho&s;e Parts, &s;ince they are not related as the Hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent time, but the Tradition of the former. His mention of <HI>Thrace,</HI> his De&s;cription of the Bea&s;ts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and of the Climate in the <HI>Fortunate I&s;lands,</HI> may &s;eem al&s;o to give us a view of him in the Extreams of the Earth, where it was not barbarous or uninhabited. It is hard to &s;et limits to the Travels of a Man, who has &s;et none to that de&s;ire of Knowledge which made him undertake them. Who can &s;ay what People he has not &s;een, who appears to be vers'd in the Cu&s;toms of all? He takes the Globe for the Scene in which he introduces his Subjects; he launches forward intre|pidly,
<PB N="24" REF="69">
like one to whom no place is new, and appears a Citi|zen of the World in general.</P>
<P>When he return'd from his Travels, he &s;eems to have apply'd him&s;elf to the fini&s;hing his Poems, however he might have ei|ther de&s;ign'd, begun, or pur&s;u'd them before. In the&s;e he has trea&s;ur'd up his various Acqui&s;itions of Knowledge, where they have been pre&s;erv'd through Ages, to be as well the Proofs of his own Indu&s;try, as the In&s;tructions of Po&s;terity. He might then de&s;cribe his Sacrifices after the <HI>Aeolian</HI> manner; or <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Iliad 3.</NOTE>his Leagues with a Mixture of <HI>Trojan</HI> and <HI>Spartan</HI> Ceremonies: <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Il. 2. &vers;. 145.</NOTE>He could then compare the Confu&s;ion of a Multitude to that Tu|mult he had ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Icarian</HI> Sea, da&s;hing and break|ing among its Crowd of I&s;lands: He could repre&s;ent the Num|bers of an Army, by tho&s;e Flocks of <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Iliad 2. &vers;. 461.</NOTE>Swans he had &s;een on the Banks of the <HI>Cay&s;ter;</HI> or being to de&s;cribe that Heat of Battel with which <HI>Achilles</HI> drove the <HI>Trojans</HI> into the River, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Il. 21. &vers;. 12.</NOTE>he could illu&s;trate it with an Allu&s;ion from <HI>Cyrene</HI> or <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where, when the Inhabitants burn'd their Fields, the Gra&s;s-hoppers fled before the Fire to peri&s;h in the Ocean. His Fancy being fully repleni&s;h'd, might &s;upply him with every proper occa&s;ional Image, and his Soul after having enlarg'd it&s;elf, and taken in an exten|&s;ive Variety of the Creation, might be equal to the Task of an <HI>Iliad</HI> and an <HI>Ody&s;&s;es.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Chara|cter <HI>and</HI> Manners.</NOTE> If we would now make a Conjecture concerning the Genius and Temper of this great Man; perhaps his Works, which would not furni&s;h us with Facts for his Life, will be more rea&s;onably made u&s;e of to give us a Picture of his Mind: To this end there|fore, we may &s;uffer the very Name and Notion of a Book to vani&s;h for a while, and look upon what is left us as a Conver|&s;ation, in order to gain an Acquaintance with <HI>Homer.</HI> Perhaps the general Air of his Works will become the general Character of his Genius, and the particular Ob&s;ervations give &s;ome Light to the particular Turns of his Temper. His comprehen&s;ive Know|ledge &s;hews that his Soul was not form'd like a narrow Chanel for a &s;ingle Stream, but as an Expan&s;e which might receive an Ocean into its Bo&s;om; that he had the &s;tronge&s;t De&s;ire of Improve|ment, and an unbounded Curio&s;ity, which made its Advantage of every tran&s;ient Circum&s;tance, or obvious Accident. His &s;olid and &s;ententious Manner may make us admire him for a Man of Judgment; one who, in the darke&s;t Ages, could enter far into a Di&s;qui&s;ition of human Nature; who, notwith&s;tanding all the Changes which Governments, Manners, Rites, and even the Notions of Virtue have undergone, could &s;till abound with &s;o many Maxims corre&s;pondent to Truth, and Notions applicable to &s;o many Sciences. The Fire, which is &s;o ob&s;ervable in his Poem, as to give every thing the mo&s;t active Appearance, may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm Temper, and lively Behaviour; and the plea&s;urable Air which every where over&s;preads it, may give us rea&s;on to think, that Fire of Imagination was temper'd with Sweetne&s;s and Affability. If we farther ob&s;erve the Particulars he treats of, and imagine that
<PB N="26" REF="71">
he laid a Stre&s;s upon the Sentiments he delivers, pur&s;uant to his real Opinions; we &s;hall take him to be of a religious Spirit, by his inculcating in almo&s;t every Page the wor&s;hip of the Gods. We &s;hall imagine him to be a generous Lover of his Countrey, from his care to extol it every where: which is carry'd to &s;uch a heighth, as to make <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Plutarch <HI>de Aud.

It might &s;eem from his Love of Stories, with his manner of telling them &s;ometimes, that he gave his own Picture when he painted his <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> and, as wi&s;e as he was, was no Enemy to Talking. One would think from his Prai&s;es of Wine, his copious Goblets, and plea&s;ing De&s;criptions of Ban|quets, that he was addicted to a chearful, &s;ociable Life, which <HI>Horace</HI> takes notice of as a kind of Tradition;

There is in all
<PB N="27" REF="72">
other Poets a Cu&s;tom of &s;peaking of them&s;elves, and a Vanity of promi&s;ing Eternity to their Writings: In both which <HI>Homer,</HI> who has the be&s;t Title to &s;peak out, is altogether &s;ilent.

<P>HAVING now fini&s;h'd what was propos'd concerning the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Life, I &s;hall proceed to that of his Works; and con&s;idering him no longer as a <HI>Man,</HI> but as an <HI>Author,</HI> pro&s;ecute the Thread of his Story in this his &s;econd Life, thro' the different Degrees of E&s;teem which tho&s;e Writings have obtain'd in different Periods of Time.</P>
<P>It has been the fortune of &s;everal great Genius's not to be known while they liv'd, either for want of Hi&s;torians, the Meanne&s;s of Fortune, or the Love of Retirement, to which a Poetical Temper is peculiarly addicted. Yet after Death their Works give them&s;elves a Life in Fame, without the help of an Hi&s;torian; and, notwith&s;tanding the Meanne&s;s of their Author, or his Love of Retreat, they go forth among Mankind, the Glories of that Age which produc'd them, and the Delight of tho&s;e which follow it. This is a Fate particularly verify'd in <HI>Homer,</HI> than whom no con&s;i|derable Author is le&s;s known as to him&s;elf, or more highly valu'd as to his Productions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Publication of his Works by</HI> Lycur|gus.</NOTE> The earlie&s;t Account of the&s;e is &s;aid by <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>vit.</HI> Lycurgi.</NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> to be &s;ome time after his Death, when <HI>Lycurgus</HI> &s;ail'd to <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"There he had the fir&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Works, which were probably pre&s;erv'd by the Grand-children of <HI>Creophilus;</HI> and having ob&s;erv'd that their plea&s;urable Air of Fiction did not hinder the Poets abounding in Maxims of State, and Rules of Morality, he tran&s;crib'd and carry'd with him that entire Collection we have now among us: For at that time (continues this Author) there was only an ob|&s;cure Rumour in <HI>Greece</HI> to the Reputation of the&s;e Poems, and but a few &s;catter'd Fragments handed about, 'till <HI>Ly|curgus</HI> publi&s;h'd them entire."</Q> Thus they were in danger of being lo&s;t as &s;oon as they were produced, by the Misfor|tune of the Age, a want of Ta&s;te in Learning, or the man|ner
<PB N="32" REF="77">
in which they were left to Po&s;terity, when they fell into the Hands of <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> He was a Man of great Learning, a Law-giver to a People divided and untractable, and one who had a Notion that Poetry influenc'd and civiliz'd the Minds of Men; which made him &s;mooth the way to his Con&s;titution by the Songs of <HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Cretan,</HI> whom he en|gag'd to write upon Obedience and Concord. As he propos'd to him&s;elf that the Con&s;titution he would rai&s;e upon this their Union &s;hould be of a martial Nature, the&s;e Poems were of an extraordinary Value to him: for they came with a full Force into his Scheme; the Moral they in&s;pir'd was Unity; the Air they breath'd was Martial; and their Story had this particular Engagement for the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> that it &s;hew'd <HI>Greece</HI> in War, and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> &s;ubdu'd under the Conduct of one of their own Monarchs, who commanded all the <HI>Graecian</HI> Princes. Thus the Poet both pleas'd the Law-giver, and the People: from whence he had a double Influence when the Laws were &s;ettled. For his Poem then became a Panegyrick on their Con&s;titution, as well as a Regi&s;ter of their Glory; and confirm'd them in the Love of it by a gallant De&s;cri|ption of tho&s;e Qualities and Actions for which it was adapted. This made <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Plutarch. <HI>Apoptheg.</HI></NOTE><HI>Cleomenes</HI> call him <HI>The Poet of the</HI> Lacedaemonians: And therefore when we remember that <HI>Homer</HI> owed the Pub|lication of his Works to <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> we &s;hould grant too, that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> owed in &s;ome degree the Enforcement of his Laws to the Works of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>

<HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> venerable Names in Antiquity, and eminently cele|brated in Fable for the wonderful Power of their Songs and Mu&s;ick.

What &s;ort of Poets <HI>Homer</HI> &s;aw in his own Time may be gather'd from his De&s;cription of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Od. 1^&s;^t <HI>and</HI> Od. 8^t^h.</NOTE><HI>Demo|docus</HI> and <HI>Phemius,</HI> whom he has introduc'd as Opportunities to celebrate his Profe&s;&s;ion.

From this poor State of Poetry, he has taken a handle to u&s;her it into the World with the bolde&s;t Stroke of Prai&s;e which has ever been given it.

Whatever was &s;erious or magnificent made a part of his Sub|ject: War and Peace were the comprehen&s;ive Divi&s;ion in which he con&s;ider'd the World; and the Plans of his Poems were founded on the mo&s;t active Scenes of each, the Adven|tures of a Siege, and the Accidents of a Voyage. For the&s;e his Spirit was equally active and various, lofty in Expre&s;&s;ion, clear in Narration, natural in De&s;cription, rapid in Action, abundant in Figures. If ever he appears le&s;s than him&s;elf, it is from the Time he writ in; and if he runs into Errors, it is from an Exce&s;s, rather than a Defect of Genius. Thus he ro&s;e over the Poetical World, &s;hining out like a Sun all at once, which if it &s;ometimes make too <HI>faint</HI> an Appearance, 'tis to be a&s;crib'd only to the nece&s;&s;ity of the Sea&s;on that keeps it at a di&s;tance; and if he is &s;ometimes too <HI>violent,</HI> we confe&s;s at the &s;ame time that we owe all things to his Heat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theology.</NOTE> As for his <HI>Theology,</HI> we &s;ee the Heathen Sy&s;tem entirely follow'd. This was all he could then have to work upon, and where he fails of Truth for want of Revelation he at lea&s;t &s;hows his Knowledge in his own Religion by the Traditions he delivers. But we are now upon a Point to be farther handled, becau&s;e the greate&s;t Controver&s;y concerning the Merit of <HI>Homer</HI> depends upon it. Let us con&s;ider then that there was an Age in <HI>Greece,</HI> when natural Rea&s;on only di&s;cover'd there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;uperior to us, and Tradition had af|fix'd the Notion to a Number of Deities. At this time <HI>Homer</HI> ro&s;e with the fine&s;t Turn imaginable for Poetry, who de&s;ign|ing
<PB N="43" REF="88">
to in&s;truct Mankind in the manner for which he was mo&s;t adapted, writ Poems wherein he made u&s;e of the Mi|ni&s;try of the Gods to give the highe&s;t Air of Surprize and Veneration to his Writings. He found the Religion of Man|kind wrapt up in Fables; it was thought then the ea&s;ie&s;t way to convey Morals to the People, who were allur'd to Attention by Plea&s;ure, and aw'd with the Opinion of a hidden My&s;tery. Nor was it his Bu&s;ine&s;s when he undertook the Province of a Poet (not of a meer Philo&s;opher) to be the fir&s;t who &s;hould di&s;card That which furni&s;hes Poetry with its mo&s;t beautiful Appearance: and e&s;pecially &s;ince the Age he liv'd in, by di&s;covering its Ta&s;te, had not only given him Autho|rity, but even put him under the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving it. Whatever therefore he might think of his Gods, he took them as he found them: he brought them into Action accord|ing to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in &s;ome Stories as they were then believ'd; unle&s;s we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers. Yet there are &s;everal Rays of Truth &s;treaming through all this Darkne&s;s, in tho&s;e Senti|ments he entertains concerning the Gods; and &s;everal <HI>Alle|gories</HI> lightly veil'd over, from whence the learned drew new Knowledges, each according to his Power of Penetration and Fancy. But that we may the better comprehend him in all the Parts of this general View, let us extract from him a Scheme of his Religion.</P>
<P>He has a <HI>Jupiter,</HI> a <HI>Father of Gods and Men,</HI> whom he makes &s;upream, and to whom he applies &s;everal Attri|butes, as Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Knowledge, Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are e&s;&s;entially inherent to the Idea of a God. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Iliad 24. &vers;. 527.</NOTE>He has given him two <HI>Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> out of which he di&s;tributes natural <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil</HI> for the Life of Man; he places the Gods in Council round him; he makes <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Il. 9. &vers;. 498.</NOTE><HI>Prayers</HI> pa&s;s to and fro before him; and Mankind adore him with Sacrifice. But all this grand Appearance, wherein Poetry paid a deference to Rea&s;on, is da&s;h'd and mingled with the Imperfection of our Nature; not only with the applying our Pa&s;&s;ions to the &s;u|preme Being (for Men have always been treated with this
<PB N="44" REF="89">
Complyance to their Notions) but that he is not even ex|empted from our common Appetites and Frailties: For he is made to eat, drink, and &s;leep: but this his Admirers would imagine to be only a gro&s;&s;er way of repre&s;enting a general Notion of Happine&s;s, becau&s;e he &s;ays in one place,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Il. 5. &vers;. 340.</NOTE> that the Food of the Gods was not of the &s;ame Nature with ours. But upon the whole, while he endeavour'd to &s;peak of a Deity without a right Information, he was forc'd to take him from that Image he di&s;cover'd in <HI>Man;</HI> and (like one who being dazled with the Sun in the Heavens, would view him as he is reflected in a River) he has taken off the Impre&s;&s;ion not only ruffled with the Emotion of our Pa&s;&s;ions, but ob&s;cur'd with the earthy Mixture of our Natures.</P>
<P>The other Gods have all their Provinces a&s;&s;ign'd 'em: <Q REND="inline">"Every thing has its peculiar Deity, &s;ays <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Maxim. Tyrius, <HI>Di&s;&s;.</HI> 16.</NOTE><HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> by which <HI>Homer</HI> would in&s;inuate that the Godhead was pre&s;ent to all things."</Q> When they are con&s;ider'd farther, we find he has turn'd the Virtues and Endowments of our Minds into <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> to make the Springs of Action become vi&s;ible; and becau&s;e they are given by the Gods, he re|pre&s;ents them as Gods them&s;elves de&s;cending from Heaven. In the &s;ame &s;trong Light he &s;hows our Vices when they oc|ca&s;ion Misfortunes, like extraordinary Powers which inflict them upon us, and even our natural Puni&s;hments are repre&s;ented as Puni&s;hers them&s;elves. But when we come to &s;ee the man|ner they are introduc'd in, they are found fea&s;ting, fighting, wounded by Men, and &s;hedding a &s;ort of Blood; in which his Machines play a little too gro&s;ly: the Fable which was admitted to procure the Plea&s;ure of Surprize, violently op|pre&s;&s;es the Allegory, and it may be lo&s;t labour to &s;earch for it in every minute Circum&s;tance, if indeed it was intended to be there. The main De&s;ign was however Philo&s;ophical, the Dre&s;s the Poet's, which is us'd for nece&s;&s;ity and allow'd to be ornamental. And there will be &s;omething &s;till to be of|fer'd in his Defence, if he has both pre&s;erved the grand Moral from being ob&s;cur'd, and adorn'd the Parts of his Works with &s;uch Sentiments of the Gods as belong'd to the Age he liv'd
<PB N="45" REF="90">
in; which that he did, appears from his having then had that Succe&s;s for which Allegory was contriv'd. <Q REND="inline">"It is the Madne&s;s of Man, &s;ays <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Maxim.

Thus as Poets in Name, and Philo&s;ophers in Effect, they drew Mankind gradually to a &s;earch after Truth, when the Name of Phi|lo&s;opher would have been har&s;h and di&s;plea&s;ing."</Q></P>
<P>When <HI>Homer</HI> proceeds to tell us our Duty to the&s;e &s;upe|rior Beings, we find Prayer, Sacrifice, Lu&s;tration, and all the Rites which were e&s;teem'd religious, con&s;tantly recommended under fear of their Di&s;plea&s;ure. We find too a Notion of the Soul's &s;ub&s;i&s;ting after this Life, but for want of Revelation he knows not what to reckon the Happine&s;s of a future State, to any one who was not deify'd: Which is plain from the Speech of <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;. 11. &vers;. 488.</NOTE><HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the Region of the dead; where he tells him, that <Q REND="inline">"he would rather &s;erve the poore&s;t Creature upon Earth than rule over all the departed."</Q> It was chiefly for this Rea&s;on that <HI>Plato</HI> excluded him his Com|mon-Wealth; he thought <HI>Homer</HI> &s;poke indecently of the Gods, and dreadfully of a future State; in which Sentence he has made no Allowance for the Times he writ in. But if he can not be defended in every thing as a Theologi&s;t, yet we may &s;ay in re&s;pect of his Poetry, that he has enrich'd it from Theology with true Sentiments for Profit, adorn'd it with Allegories for Plea&s;ure, and by u&s;ing &s;ome Machines which have no farther Significancy or are &s;o refin'd as to make it doubted if they have any, he has however produc'd that Character in Poetry which we call the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> and from which the <HI>Agreeable</HI> (according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>) is always in&s;eparable.</P>

States; and whatever was manag'd in War amounted to no more than inte&s;tine Skirmi&s;hes or Pyracies abroad, which were ea&s;ily reveng'd on account of their Di&s;union.

But this la&s;t having greater Friends and Alliances than any upon whom the Rapes had hitherto fallen, the Ruin of <HI>Troy</HI> was the Con&s;equence; and the Force of the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Coa&s;ts was &s;o broken, that this Accident put an end to the Age of Pyracies. Then the inte&s;tine Broils of <HI>Greece</HI> (which had been di&s;continued during the League) were renew'd upon its Di&s;&s;olution. War and Sedition mov'd People from Place to Place during its want of Inhabitants; Exiles from one Country were receiv'd for Kings in another; and Leaders took Tracts of Ground to be&s;tow them upon their Followers. Commerce was neglected, living at home un&s;afe, and no|thing of Moment tranfacted by any but again&s;t their Neigh|bours: <HI>Athens</HI> only, where the People were undi&s;turb'd be|cau&s;e it was a barren Soil which no Body coveted, had begun to &s;end Colonies abroad, being over-&s;tock'd with Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Now a Poem coming out at &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a Time, with a Moral capable of healing the&s;e Di&s;orders by promoting <HI>Union,</HI> we may rea&s;onably think it was de&s;ign'd for that End to which it is &s;o peculiarly adapted.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morality.</NOTE> The <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> could not be perfect while there was a Weakne&s;s in its Government; Faults in Politicks are oc|ca&s;ion'd by Faults in Ethicks, and occa&s;ion them in their turn. The Divi&s;ion into &s;o many States was the ri&s;e of fre|quent Quarrels, whereby Men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable Di&s;po&s;ition. Bodily Strength met with the greate&s;t Honours, becau&s;e it was daily nece&s;&s;ary to the Sub&s;i&s;tence of little Governments; and that headlong Courage which throws it&s;elf forward to Enterprize and Plunder, was univer&s;ally care&s;s'd, becau&s;e it carry'd all things before it. It is no wonder in an Age of &s;uch Education and Cu&s;toms, that, as <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Thucydides</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Robbing was honour'd, provided it were done with Gallantry, and that the ancient Poets made People que&s;tion one another as they &s;ail'd by, <HI>if they were Thieves?</HI> as a thing for which no one ought either to be &s;corn'd or upbraided."</Q> The&s;e were the &s;ort of Acti|ons which the Singers then recorded, and it was out of &s;uch an Age that <HI>Homer</HI> was to take his Subjects. For this rea&s;on (not a want of Morality in him) we &s;ee a boa&s;ting Temper and unmanag'd Roughne&s;s in the Spirit of his Heroes, which ran out in Pride, Anger, or Cruelty.

<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of the Story every Part of it has its Le&s;&s;ons of Morality: There is brotherly Love in <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> Friend&s;hip in <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and the Love of his Country in <HI>Hector.</HI> But &s;ince we have &s;poken of the <HI>Iliad</HI> as more particular for its Politicks, we may con|&s;ider the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI> as its Moral is more directly fram'd for Ethicks. It carries the Heroe through a world of Trials both of the dangerous and plea&s;urable Nature. It &s;hows him fir&s;t under mo&s;t &s;urprizing Weights of Adver&s;ity, among Ship|wrecks and Savages; all the&s;e he is made to pa&s;s through in the Methods by which it becomes a Man to conquer; a Pa|tience in &s;uffering, and a Pre&s;ence of Mind in every Accident. It &s;hows him again in another View, tempted with the Baits of idle or unlawful Plea&s;ures, and then points out the Me|thods of being &s;afe from them. But if in general we con&s;ider the care our Author has taken to fix his Le&s;&s;ons of Morality by the Proverbs and Precepts he delivers, we &s;hall not won|der if <HI>Greece</HI> which afterwards gave the Appellation of <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> to Men who &s;ettled <HI>&s;ingle Sentences</HI> of Truth, &s;hould give him the Title of the <HI>Father of Virtue</HI> for introducing &s;uch a Number. To be brief, if we take the Opinion of <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Qui quid &s;it pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</L>
<L>Plenius &amp; melius Chry&s;ippo &amp; Crantore dicit.</L>
<BIBL>Hor. <HI>Ep.</HI> 2. <HI>lib</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q></NOTE><HI>Horace,</HI> he has propos'd him to us as a Ma&s;ter of Morality; he lays down the common Philo&s;ophical Divi&s;ion of <HI>Good</HI> into <HI>plea|&s;ant, profitable,</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t;</HI> and then a&s;&s;erts that <HI>Homer</HI> has more fully and clearly in&s;tructed us in each of them, than the mo&s;t rigid Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Some indeed have thought notwith&s;tanding all this, that <HI>Homer</HI> had only a de&s;ign to plea&s;e in his Inventions; and that others have &s;ince extracted Morals out of his Stories (and indeed all Stories are capable of being us'd &s;o.) But this is an
<PB N="49" REF="94">
Opinion concerning Poetry which the World has rather dege|nerated into, than begun with. The Traditions of <HI>Orpheus</HI>'s civilizing Mankind by Hymns on the Gods, with others of the like Nature, may &s;how there was a better u&s;e of the Art both known and practis'd. There is al&s;o a remarkable Pa&s;|&s;age of this kind in the third Book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> that <HI>Aga|memnon</HI> left one of the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;. 3. &vers;. 267.</NOTE>Poets of his Times in the Court when he &s;ail'd for <HI>Troy;</HI> and that his Queen was pre&s;erv'd virtuous by his Songs, 'till <HI>Aegy&s;thus</HI> was forc'd to expel him in order to debauch her. Here he has hinted what a true Poetical Spirit can do when apply'd to the Promotion of Virtue; and from this one may judge he could not but de&s;ign That him|&s;elf, which he recommends as the Duty and Merit of his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Others &s;ince his Time may have &s;educ'd the Art to wor&s;e Intentions; but they who are offended at the Liberties of &s;ome Poets, &s;hould not judge all in the gro&s;s for trifling or Corruption; e&s;pecially when the Evidence runs &s;o &s;trongly for any One to the contrary.</P>
<P>We may in general go on to ob&s;erve, that the time when <HI>Homer</HI> was born did not abound in Learning. For where|ever Politicks and Morality is weak, it wants its peaceable Air to thrive in, and that Opportunity which is not known in the Ages of un&s;ettled Life. He is him&s;elf the Man from whom we have the fir&s;t Accounts of Antiquity, either in its Actions or Learning; from whom we hear what <HI>Aegypt</HI> or <HI>Greece</HI> could inform him in, and whatever him&s;elf could di&s;|cover by the Strength of Nature or Indu&s;try. But however that we may not mi&s;take the Elogies of tho&s;e Ancients who call him the <HI>Father of Arts and Sciences,</HI> and be &s;urpriz'd to find &s;o little of them (as they are now in Perfection) in his Works; we &s;hould know that this Character is not to be un|der&s;tood at large, as if he had included the full and regular Sy&s;tems of every thing: He is to be con&s;ider'd profe&s;&s;edly only in Quality of a Poet; this was his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to which, as whatever he knew was to be &s;ub&s;ervient, &s;o he has not fail'd to introduce tho&s;e Strokes of Knowledge from the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences, which the Subject de|manded

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> Before his Time there were no <HI>Hi&s;torians</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> He treated Hi&s;torically of pa&s;t Tran&s;actions, according as he could be inform'd by Tradition, Song, or whatever Method there was of pre&s;erving their Memory. For this we have the Con&s;ent of Antiquity; they have generally more appeal'd to his Au|thority, and more in&s;i&s;ted on it than on the Te&s;timony of any other Writer, when they treat of the Rites, Cu&s;toms, and Manners of the fir&s;t Times. They have generally believ'd that the Acts of <HI>Tydeus</HI> at <HI>Thebes,</HI> the &s;econd Siege of that City, the Settlement of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the Battel between the <HI>Curetes</HI> and the <HI>Aetolians,</HI> the Account of the Kings of <HI>Mycenae</HI> by the Sceptre of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> the Acts of the <HI>Greeks</HI> at <HI>Troy,</HI> and many other &s;uch Accounts, are &s;ome of them wholly pre&s;erv'd by him, and the re&s;t as faithfully related as by any Hi&s;torian.

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Contention of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the War of <HI>Troy,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> having &s;ack'd &s;ome of the neighbouring Towns, and taken from thence two beautiful Captives, <HI>Chru&s;eis</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;eis,</HI> allotted the fir&s;t to <HI>Aga|gamemnon,</HI> and the la&s;t to <HI>Achilles. Chry&s;es,</HI> the Father of <HI>Chru&s;eis</HI> and Prie&s;t of <HI>Apollo,</HI> comes to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp to ran&s;ome her; with which the Action of the Poem opens, in the Tenth Year of the Siege. The Prie&s;t being refus'd and in&s;olently di&s;mi&s;s'd by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> intreats for Vengeance from his God, who inflicts a Pe&s;tilence on the <HI>Greeks. Achilles</HI> calls a Coun|cil, and encourages <HI>Chalcas</HI> to declare the Cau&s;e of it, who at|tributes it to the Refu&s;al of <HI>Chru&s;eis.</HI> The King being obliged to &s;end back his Captive, enters into a furious Conte&s;t with <HI>Achilles,</HI> which <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> pacifies; however as he had the ab&s;o|lute Command of the Army, he &s;eizes on <HI>Bri&s;eis</HI> in revenge. <HI>Achilles</HI> in di&s;content withdraws him&s;elf and his Forces from the re&s;t of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and complaining to <HI>Thetis,</HI> &s;he &s;upplicates <HI>Jupiter</HI> to render them &s;en&s;ible of the Wrong done to her Son, by giving Victory to the <HI>Trojans. Jupiter</HI> granting her Suit incen&s;es <HI>Juno,</HI> between whom the Debate runs high, 'till they are reconciled by the Addre&s;s of <HI>Vulcan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Time</HI> of two and twenty Days is taken up in this Book; nine during the Plague, one in the Council and Quarrel of the Princes, and twelve for <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Stay with the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> at who&s;e Return <HI>Thetis</HI> prefers her Petition. The Scene lies in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, then changes to <HI>Chry&s;a,</HI> and la&s;tly to the Gods on <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE Fir&s;t Book.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="141">OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;omething &s;trange that of all the Commentators upon <HI>Homer,</HI> there is hardly one who&s;e principal De|&s;ign is to illu&s;trate the Poetical Beauties of the Author. They are voluminous in explaining tho&s;e Sciences which he made but &s;ub&s;ervient to his Poetry, and &s;paring only upon that Art which con&s;titutes his Character. This has been occa&s;ion'd by the O&s;tentation of Men who had more Reading than Ta&s;te, and were fonder of &s;hew|ing their Variety of Learning in all Kinds, than their &s;ingle Under&s;tanding in Poetry. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that their Remarks are rather Philo&s;ophical, Hi&s;torical, Geo|graphical, Allegorical, or in &s;hort rather any thing than Critical and Poetical. Even the Grammarians, tho' their whole Bu&s;ine&s;s and U&s;e be only to render the Words of an Author intelligible, are &s;trangely touch'd with the Pride of doing &s;omething more than they ought. The grand Am|bition of one &s;ort of Scholars is to encrea&s;e the Number of <HI>Various Lections;</HI> which they have done to &s;uch a degree of ob&s;cure Diligence, that we now begin to value the fir&s;t Edi|tions of Books as mo&s;t correct, becau&s;e they have been lea&s;t corrected. The prevailing Pa&s;&s;ion of others is to di&s;cover <HI>New Meanings</HI> in an Author, whom they will cau&s;e to appear my&s;terious purely for the Vanity of being thought to unra|vel him. The&s;e account it a di&s;grace to be of the Opinion of tho&s;e that preceded them; and it is generally the Fate of
<PB N="4" REF="142">
&s;uch People who will never &s;ay what was &s;aid before, to &s;ay what will never be &s;aid after them. If they can but find a Word that has once been &s;train'd by &s;ome dark Writer to &s;ignify any thing different from its u&s;ual Acceptation, it is frequent with them to apply to con&s;tantly to that uncommon Meaning, whenever they meet it in a clear Writer: For Reading is &s;o much dearer to them than Sen&s;e, that they will di&s;card it at any time to make way for a Critici&s;m. In other Places where they cannot conte&s;t the Truth of the common Interpretation, they get them&s;elves room for Di&s;&s;ertation by imaginary <HI>Amphibologies,</HI> which they will have to be de&s;ign'd by the Author. This Di&s;po&s;ition of finding out different Significations in one thing, may be the Effect of either too much, or too little Wit: For Men of a right Under&s;tanding generally &s;ee at once all that an Author can rea&s;onably mean, but others are apt to fancy Two Meanings for want of know|ing One. Not to add, that there is a va&s;t deal of diffe|rence between the Learning of a Critick, and the Puzzling of a Grammarian.</P>
<P>It is no ea&s;y Task to make &s;omething out of a hundred Pedants that is not Pedantical; yet this he mu&s;t do, who would give a tolerable Ab&s;tract of the former Expo&s;itors of <HI>Homer.</HI> The Commentaries of <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> are indeed an im|men&s;e Trea&s;ury of the <HI>Greek</HI> Learning; but as he &s;eems to have ama&s;&s;ed the Sub&s;tance of whatever others had written upon the Author, &s;o he is not free from &s;ome of the fore|going Cen&s;ures. There are tho&s;e who have &s;aid, that a judicious Ab&s;tract of Him alone might furni&s;h out &s;ufficient Illu&s;trations upon <HI>Homer.</HI> It was re&s;olv'd to take the trouble of reading thro' that voluminous Work, and the Reader may be a&s;&s;ur'd, tho&s;e Remarks that any way concern the Poetry or Art of the Poet, are much fewer than is imagin'd. The greater Part of the&s;e is already plunder'd by &s;ucceeding Commentators, who have very little but what they owe to him: and I am oblig'd to &s;ay even of Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> that &s;he is either more beholden to him than &s;he has confe&s;&s;ed, or has read him le&s;s than &s;he is willing to own. She has made a farther Attempt than her Predece&s;&s;ors to di&s;cover the Beauties of the Poet; tho' we have often only
<PB N="5" REF="143">
her general Prai&s;es and Exclamations in&s;tead of Rea&s;ons. But her Remarks all together are the mo&s;t judicious Collection ex|tant of the &s;catter'd Ob&s;ervations of the Ancients and Mo|derns, as her Preface is excellent, and her Tran&s;lation equally careful and elegant.</P>
<P>The chief De&s;ign of the following Notes is to comment upon <HI>Homer</HI> as a Poet; whatever in them is extracted from others is con&s;tantly own'd; the Remarks of the Ancients are generally &s;et at length, and the Places cited: all tho&s;e of <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> are collected which fall under this Scheme: many which were not acknowledg'd by other Commentators, are re&s;tor'd to the true Owner; and the &s;ame Ju&s;tice is &s;hown to tho&s;e who refus'd it to others.</P>

<P>THE Plan of this Poem is form'd upon Anger and its ill Effects, the Plan of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s upon pious Re&s;ignation and its Rewards: and thus every Pa&s;&s;ion or Virtue may be the Foundation of the Scheme of an Epic Poem. This Di|&s;tinction between two Authors who have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;eem'd nece&s;&s;ary to be taken notice of, that they who would imitate either may not &s;tumble at the very Entrance, or curb their Imaginations &s;o as to deprive us of noble Morals told in a new Variety of Accidents. Imitation does not hinder In|vention: We may ob&s;erve the Rules of Nature, and write in the Spirit of tho&s;e who have be&s;t hit upon them, without taking the &s;ame Track, beginning in the &s;ame Manner, and following the Main of their Story almo&s;t &s;tep by &s;tep; as mo&s;t of the modern Writers of Epic Poetry have done after one of the&s;e great Poets.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="144">
<HI>between</HI> Homer <HI>and</HI> Virgil; which is by no means the mo&s;t judicious of his Works. He cavils fir&s;t at the Poet's in|&s;i&s;ting &s;o much upon the Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, That it was <Q REND="inline">"the Cau&s;e of the Woes of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>"</Q>  that it <Q REND="inline">"&s;ent &s;o many Heroes to the Shades,"</Q>  that <Q REND="inline">"their Bodies were left a Prey to Birds and Bea&s;ts,"</Q> the fir&s;t of which he thinks had been &s;ufficient. One may an&s;wer, that the Woes of <HI>Greece</HI> might con&s;i&s;t in &s;everal other things than in the Death of her He|roes, which was therefore needful to be &s;pecify'd: As to the Bodies, he might have reflected how great a Cur&s;e the want of Burial was accounted by the Ancients, and how prejudicial it was e&s;teem'd even to the Souls of the deceas'd: We have a mo&s;t particular Example of the Strength of this Opinion from the Conduct of <HI>Sophocles</HI> in his <HI>Ajax;</HI> who thought this very Point &s;ufficient to make the Di&s;tre&s;s of the la&s;t Act of that Tragedy after the Death of his Heroe, purely to &s;a|tisfy the Audience that he obtain'd the Rites of Sepulture. Next he objects it as prepo&s;terous in <HI>Homer</HI> to de&s;ire the Mu&s;e to tell him the whole Story, and at the &s;ame time to inform her &s;olemnly in his own Per&s;on that 'twas the <HI>Will of Jove</HI> which brought it about.

The&s;e are the Lights and Shades of his Cha|racter, which <HI>Homer</HI> has heighten'd and darkned in Extreams; becau&s;e on the one &s;ide Valour is the darling Quality of Epic Poetry, and on the other, Anger the particular Subject of his Poem. When Characters thus mix'd are well conducted, tho' they be not morally beautiful quite through, they con|duce more to the end, and are &s;till poetically perfect.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> takes occa&s;ion from the Ob&s;ervation of this Con|duct in <HI>Homer,</HI> to applaud his ju&s;t Imitation of Nature and Truth, in repre&s;enting Virtues and Vices intermixed in his Heroes: contrary to the Paradoxes and &s;trange Po&s;itions of the Stoicks, who held that no Vice could con&s;i&s;t with Virtue, nor the lea&s;t Virtue with Vice.

<P>IF we look upon this Piece with an Eye to ancient Learn|ing, it may be ob&s;erv'd that however fabulous the other Parts of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem may be according to the Nature of Epic Poetry, this Account of the People, Princes, and Coun|tries is purely Hi&s;torical, founded on the real Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times, and by far the mo&s;t valuable Piece of Hi&s;to|ry and Geography left us concerning the State of <HI>Greece</HI> in that early Period. <HI>Greece</HI> was then divided into &s;everal Dy|na&s;ties, which our Author has enumerated under their re|&s;pective Princes; and his Divi&s;ion was look'd upon &s;o exact, that we are told of many Controver&s;ies concerning the Boun|daries of <HI>Graecian</HI> Cities which have been decided upon the Authority of this Piece. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> has collected together the following In&s;tances. The City of <HI>Calydon</HI> was adjudg'd to the <HI>Aetolians</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Preten&s;ions of <HI>Aeolia,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> had rank'd it among the Towns belonging to the former. <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> was given to tho&s;e of <HI>Abydos,</HI> upon the Plea that he had &s;aid, the <HI>Abydonians</HI> were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of <HI>Se&s;tos, Abydos,</HI> and <HI>Arisbe.</HI> When the <HI>Mile&s;ians</HI> and People of <HI>Priene</HI> di&s;puted their Claim to <HI>Mycale,</HI> a Ver&s;e of <HI>Homer</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="255">

Nay in &s;o high E&s;timation has this Catalogue been held, that (as <HI>Porphyry</HI> has written) there have been Laws in &s;ome Nations for the Youth to learn it by heart, and par|ticularly <HI>Cerdias</HI> (whom <HI>Cuperus de Apoth.

Secondly, what an entertain|ing Scene he pre&s;ents to us, of &s;o many Countries drawn in their livelie&s;t and mo&s;t natural Colours, while we wander along with him amid&s;t a beautiful Variety of Towns, Ha|vens, Fore&s;ts, Vineyards, Groves, Mountains, and Rivers, and are perpetually amus'd with his Ob&s;ervations on the dif|ferent Soils, Products, Situations, or Pro&s;pects. Thirdly, what a noble Review he pa&s;&s;es before us of &s;o mighty an Ar|my, drawn out in order Troop by Troop; which had the Number only been told in the Gro&s;s, had never fill'd the Reader with &s;o great a Notion of the Importance of the Action. Fourthly, the De&s;cription of the differing Arms and manner of fighting of the Soldiers, and the various Attitudes he had given to the Commanders: Of the&s;e Leaders, the greate&s;t Part are either the immediate Sons of Gods, or the De&s;cendants of Gods; and how great an Idea mu&s;t we have of a War, to the waging of which &s;o many Demi-Gods and Heroes are a&s;&s;embled?

Sixthly, the agreeable Mixture of Narrations from Pa&s;&s;ages of Hi&s;tory or Fables, with which he amu&s;es and relieves us at proper Intervals. And la&s;tly, the

He ob&s;erves the &s;ame Ob&s;curity in his <HI>Patronymics.</HI> There is <HI>Palinurus Ia&s;ides,</HI> and <HI>Iapix Ia|&s;ides, Hippocoon Hyrtacides,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ylas Hyrtacides.</HI> On the contrary the Caution of <HI>Homer</HI> is remarkable, who having two of the Name of <HI>Ajax</HI> is con&s;tantly careful to di&s;tingui&s;h them by <HI>O&iuml;leus</HI> or <HI>Telamonius,</HI> the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> or the <HI>greater Ajax.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing to be alledg'd in Defence of <HI>Virgil,</HI> in an&s;wer to this Author, but the common Excu&s;e that his <HI>Aeneis</HI> was left unfini&s;h'd. And upon the whole, the&s;e are &s;uch tri|vial Slips as great Wits may pa&s;s over, and little Criticks re|joice at.</P>
<P>But <HI>Macrobius</HI> has another Remark which one may accu&s;e of evident Partiality on the &s;ide of <HI>Homer.</HI> He blames <HI>Vir|gil</HI> for having vary'd the Expre&s;&s;ion in his Catalogue to avoid the Repetition of the &s;ame Words, and prefers the bare and unadorn'd Reiterations of <HI>Homer;</HI> who begins almo&s;t every Article the &s;ame way, and ends perpetually, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Perhaps the be&s;t rea&s;on to be given for this, had been the artle&s;s Manner of the fir&s;t Times, when &s;uch Re|petitions were not thought ungraceful. This may appear from &s;everal of the like Nature in the Scripture; as in the twenty &s;ixth Chapter of <HI>Numbers,</HI> where the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are enumerated in the Plains of <HI>Moab,</HI> and each Divi&s;ion re|counted in the &s;ame Words. So in the &s;eventh Chapter of the <HI>Revelations: Of the Tribe of</HI> Gad <HI>were &s;ealed twelve thou&s;and, &amp;c.</HI> But the Words of <HI>Macrobius</HI> are <HI>Has copias forta&s;&s;e putat aliquis Divinae illi &s;implicitati praeferendas. Sed ne&s;cio quo modo Ho|merum</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="258">
<HI>repetitio illa unic&egrave; decet, &amp; e&s;t genio antiqui Poetae digna.</HI> This is exactly in the Spirit, and almo&s;t in the Cant of a true modern Critick. The <HI>Simplicitas,</HI> the <HI>Ne&s;cio quo modo,</HI> the <HI>Genio antiqui Poetae digna,</HI> are excellent general Phra&s;es for tho&s;e who have no Rea&s;ons. <HI>Simplicity</HI> is our Word of Di&s;gui&s;e for a &s;hameful unpoetical Neglect of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion: The Term of the <HI>Je ne &s;&ccedil;ay quoy</HI> is the very Sup|port of all ignorant Pretenders to Delicacy; and to lift up our Eyes, and talk of the <HI>Genius of an Ancient,</HI> is at once the cheape&s;t way of &s;hewing our own Ta&s;te, and the &s;horte&s;t way of criticizing the Wit of others our Contemporaries.</P>
<P>One may add to the foregoing Compari&s;on of the&s;e two Authors, &s;ome Rea&s;ons for the Length of <HI>Homer</HI>'s, and the Shortne&s;s of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Catalogues. As, that <HI>Homer</HI> might have a De&s;ign to &s;ettle the Geography of his Country, there be|ing no De&s;cription of <HI>Greece</HI> before his Days; which was not the Ca&s;e with <HI>Virgil. Homer</HI>'s Concern was to compliment <HI>Greece</HI> at a time when it was divided into many di&s;tinct States, each of which might expect a Place in his Catalogue: But when all <HI>Italy</HI> was &s;wallow'd up in the &s;ole Dominion of <HI>Rome, Virgil</HI> had only <HI>Rome</HI> to celebrate. <HI>Homer</HI> had a numerous Army, and was to de&s;cribe an important War with great and various Events; whereas <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Sphere was much more con|fined. The Ships of the <HI>Greeks</HI> are computed at about one thou&s;and two hundred, tho&s;e of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and his Aids but at two and forty; and as the Time of the Action of both Poems is the &s;ame, we may &s;uppo&s;e the Built of their Ships, and the Number of Men they contain'd, to be much alike. So that if the Army of <HI>Homer</HI> amounts to about a hundred thou|&s;and Men, that of <HI>Virgil</HI> cannot be above four thou&s;and. If any one be farther curious to know upon what this Compu|tation is founded, he may &s;ee it in the following Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Thucidydes, lib.</HI> 1. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Homer</HI>'s Fleet (&s;ays he) con&s;i&s;ted of one thou&s;and two hundred Ve&s;&s;els: tho&s;e of the <HI>Boeotians</HI> carry'd one hundred and twenty Men in each, and tho&s;e of <HI>Philoctetes</HI> fifty. By the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> expre&s;t the large&s;t and the &s;malle&s;t Size of Ships, and therefore men|tions no other &s;ort. But he tells us of tho&s;e who &s;ail'd
<PB N="33" REF="259">
with <HI>Philoctetes,</HI> that they &s;erv'd both as Mariners and Sol|diers, in &s;aying the Rowers were all of them Archers. From hence the whole Number will be &s;een, if we e&s;timate the Ships at a Medium between the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t."</Q> That is to &s;ay, at eighty five Men to each Ve&s;&s;el (which is the Mean between fifty and a hundred and twenty) the Total comes to a hundred and two thou&s;and Men. <HI>Plutarch</HI> was therefore in a Mi&s;take when he computed the Men at a hundred and twenty thou&s;and, which proceeded from his &s;uppo&s;ing a hun|dred and twenty in every Ship; the contrary to which ap|pears from the above-mention'd Ships of <HI>Philoctetes,</HI> as well as from tho&s;e of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which are &s;aid to carry but fifty Men a-piece, in the &s;ixteenth <HI>Iliad,</HI> &vers;. 167.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Imitation of this Catalogue, there has &s;carce been any Epic Writer but has copy'd after it; which is at lea&s;t a Proof how beautiful this Part has been ever e&s;teem'd by the fine&s;t Genius's in all Ages. The Catalogues in the ancient Poets are generally known, only I mu&s;t take notice that the <HI>Phocian</HI> and <HI>Boeotian</HI> Towns in the fourth <HI>Thebaid</HI> of <HI>Sta|tius</HI> are tran&s;lated from hence. Of the Moderns, tho&s;e which mo&s;t excel, owe their Beauty to the Imitation of &s;ome &s;ingle Particular only of <HI>Homer.</HI> Thus the chief Grace of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s Catalogue con&s;i&s;ts in the De&s;cription of the Heroes, without any thing remarkable on the &s;ide of the Countries: Of the Pieces of Story he has interwoven, that of <HI>Tancred</HI>'s Amour to <HI>Clo|rinda</HI> is ill placed, and evidently too long for the re&s;t. <HI>Spen|cer</HI>'s Enumeration of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h Rivers</HI> in the ele|venth Canto of his fourth Book, is one of the noble&s;t in the World; if we con&s;ider his Subject was more confined, and can excu&s;e his not ob&s;erving the Order or Cour&s;e of the Country; but his Variety of De&s;cription, and Fruitfulne&s;s of Imagination are no where more admirable than in that Part. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Li&s;t of the fallen Angels in his fir&s;t Book is an exact Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> as far as regards the Digre&s;&s;ions of Hi&s;tory and An|tiquities, and his manner of in&s;erting them: In all el&s;e I be|lieve it mu&s;t be allow'd inferior. And indeed what <HI>Macro|bius</HI> has &s;aid to ca&s;t <HI>Virgil</HI> below <HI>Homer,</HI> will fall much more &s;trongly upon all the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="260">
I had &s;ome cau&s;e to fear that this Catalogue which contri|buted &s;o much to the Succe&s;s of the Author, &s;hould ruin that of the Tran&s;lator. A meer heap of proper Names tho' but for a few Lines together, could afford little Entertainment to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, who probably could not be appriz'd ei|ther of the Nece&s;&s;ity or Beauty of this Part of the Poem. There were but two things to be done to give it a chance to plea&s;e him; to render the Ver&s;ification very flowing and mu|&s;ical, and to make the whole appear as much a <HI>Land&s;cape</HI> or <HI>Piece of Painting</HI> as po&s;&s;ible. For both of the&s;e I had the Example of <HI>Homer</HI> in general; and <HI>Virgil,</HI> who found the Nece&s;&s;ity in another Age to give more into De&s;cription, &s;eem'd to authori&s;e the latter in particular. <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Ha|licarna&s;&s;us</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Structure and Di&s;po&s;ition of Words,</HI> profe&s;&s;es to admire nothing more than that har|monious Exactne&s;s with which <HI>Homer</HI> has placed the&s;e Words, and &s;often'd the Syllables into each other, &s;o as to derive Mu&s;ick from a Croud of Names which have in them|&s;elves no Beauty or Dignity. I would flatter my &s;elf that I have practis'd this not un&s;ucce&s;sfully in our Language, which is more &s;u&s;ceptible of all the Variety and Power of Numbers than any of the modern, and &s;econd to none but the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman.</HI> For the latter Point, I have ventured to open the Pro&s;pect a little, by the addition of a few Epithets or &s;hort Hints of De&s;cription to &s;ome of the Places mention'd; tho' &s;eldom exceeding the Compa&s;s of half a Ver&s;e (the Space to which my Author him&s;elf generally confines the&s;e Pictures in Miniature.) But this has never been done without the be&s;t Authorities from the Ancients, which may be &s;een under the re&s;pective Names in the Geographical Table following.</P>
<P>The Table it&s;elf I thought but nece&s;&s;ary to annex to the Map, as my Warrant for the Situations a&s;&s;ign'd in it to &s;eve|ral of the Towns.

The fir&s;t contains what pa&s;s'd before the two Armies, and the Propo&s;al of the Combate between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus:</HI> The Attention and Su&s;pen&s;e of the&s;e mighty Ho&s;ts, which were ju&s;t upon the Point of joining Battel, and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unex|pected Challenge, have &s;omething in them wonderfully pom|pous and of an amu&s;ing Solemnity. The &s;econd Part which de|&s;cribes the Behaviour of <HI>Helena</HI> in this Juncture, her Conference with the old King and his Coun&s;ellors, with the Review of the Heroes from the Battelments, is an Epi&s;ode entirely of another &s;ort, which excels in the Natural and Pathetick. The third con&s;i&s;ts of the Ceremonies of the Oath on both &s;ides and the Preliminaries to the Combate; with the beau|tiful Retreat of <HI>Priam,</HI> who in the Tenderne&s;s of a Parent withdraws from the &s;ight of the Duel: The&s;e Particulars de|tain the Reader in Expectation, and heighten his Impatience for the Fight it&s;elf.

The chief Moral of <HI>Homer</HI> was to expo&s;e the ill Ef|fects of Di&s;cord; the <HI>Greeks</HI> were to be &s;hewn di&s;united, and to render that Di&s;union the more probable, he has de&s;ign|edly given them <HI>mixt</HI> Characters.

We &s;ee her fir&s;t in Tears, repentant, cover'd with Confu&s;ion at the &s;ight of <HI>Priam,</HI> and &s;ecretly inclin'd to return to her former Spou&s;e. The Di&s;grace of <HI>Paris</HI> increa&s;es her Di&s;|like of him; &s;he rails, &s;he reproaches, &s;he wi&s;hes his Death; and after all, is prevail'd upon by one kind Compliment, and yields to his Embraces. Methinks when this Lady's Ob|&s;ervation and mine are laid together, the be&s;t that can be made of them is to conclude, that &s;ince both the Sexes have their Frailties, it would be well for each to forgive the other.</P>
<P>It is worth looking backward, to ob&s;erve the <HI>Allegory</HI> here carry'd on with re&s;pect to <HI>Helena,</HI> who lives thro' this whole Book in a Whirl of Pa&s;&s;ions, and is agitated by turns with Sentiments of Honour and Love.

of Honour) is &s;ent for her; and when invited to the Bed-Chamber of <HI>Paris, Venus</HI> is to beckon her out of the Com|pany.

He meant to compare the manner how <HI>Troy</HI> after many Battels, and after the Lo&s;s of many Cities, conquer'd by the many Nations under <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in a long War, was thereby wea|ken'd and at la&s;t overthrown, with a great Tree hewn round about, and then falling by little and little lei&s;urely. So that neither the&s;e two De&s;criptions nor the two Compari&s;ons can be compared together. The Image of a Man lying on the Ground is one thing; the Image of falling (e&s;pecially of a Kingdom) is another. This therefore gives no Advantage to <HI>Virgil</HI> over <HI>Homer.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Hobbes.</HI></P>

<P>The Reader will excu&s;e our taking notice of &s;uch a Trifle, as that it was an old Super&s;tition, that this fourth Book of the <HI>Iliads</HI> being laid under the Head, was a Cure for the <HI>Quartan Ague. Serenus Sammonicus,</HI> a celebrated Phy&s;ician in the time of the younger <HI>Gordian</HI> and Preceptor to that Emperor, has gravely pre&s;crib'd it among other Receipts in his medicinal Precepts, <HI>Praec.</HI> 50.<Q>Moeoniae Iliados quartum &s;uppone timenti.</Q> I believe it will be found a true Ob&s;ervation, that there ne|ver was any thing &s;o ab&s;urd or ridiculous, but has at one time or other been written even by &s;ome Author of Reputa|tion: A Reflection it may not be improper for Writers to make, as being at once &s;ome Mortification to their Vanity, and &s;ome Comfort to their Infirmity.</P>
