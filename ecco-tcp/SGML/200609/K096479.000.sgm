<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 TIM. iv. 1.</BIBL>
<Q>NOW THE SPIRIT SPEAKETH EXPRESSLY, THAT IN THE LATTER TIMES SOME SHALL DEPART FROM THE FAITH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OF the many artifices which infidels have em|ployed in their attacks on the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, neither the lea&s;t common nor the lea&s;t di&s;|hone&s;t is their availing them&s;elves, for disfigur|ing its beauty and undermining its truth, of all the corruptions which the weakne&s;s or the wick|edne&s;s of men have aukwardly intermixed with it or &s;uperadded to it. Again&s;t the religion of the New Te&s;tament, they have repeatedly urged objections for which it gives not even a pretence, and which can affect only human &s;y|&s;tems,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
totally abhorrent from its real nature and prevailing genius.</P>
<P>It is with a more &s;pecious appearance both of fairne&s;s and of penetration, that they have attempted to infer its fal&s;ehood from the very exi&s;tence of the&s;e corruptions; arguing, that, if God really gave the go&s;pel as his be&s;t gift to mankind, his providence would have certainly pre&s;erved its purity, and prevented its being vitiated, &s;o as to become unfit for an&s;wer|ing its important end, or even in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ubver&s;ive of it.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of enlarging on the &s;everal topics from which it might be evinced that this argu|ment is wholly inconclu&s;ive, let us remark, what is more extraordinary, That the very cor|ruptions from which it is deduced, afford evi|dence of the truth of Chri&s;tianity. Unfavour|able to the defence of this religion as, in one light, they &s;eem to be, yet, viewed in other lights, they are a real proof of its divinity.</P>
<P>That corruption which has taken place, was fore&s;een and &s;oretold by the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of the Go&s;pel; and is therefore an irrefragable de|mon&s;tration of their divine in&s;piration. It was
<PB N="3" REF="5">
in the very beginning of Chri&s;tianity, while, as as far as human eye could &s;ee, it yet remained untainted, that the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles &s;aid, in my text, <Q>Now the Spirit &s;peaketh expre&s;s|ly, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith.</Q> In the context, and the other pa&s;&s;ages which relate to this &s;ubject <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 1, &amp;c. 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3,&mdash;12.</NOTE>, he de&s;cribes, as has been often inconte&s;tibly prov|ed, even in its mo&s;t &s;ingular, unprecedented, and characteri&s;tical features, that grand apo&s;ta&s;y in the church, which did <HI>already work,</HI> though &s;o covertly as to be decernible only by a divine|ly illuminated eye; but which early di&s;played it&s;elf in the &s;ubtilizing and impo&s;ing &s;pirit of Chri&s;tians, and was completed in the ab&s;urd theology, the &s;uper&s;titious and idolatrous wor|&s;hip, the impure morality, the domination, the in&s;olence, and the cruelty of the papal church. He de&s;cribes it with &s;uch accuracy and preci|&s;ion, as could proceed only from the in&s;pira|tion of the Omni&s;cient, and therefore demon|&s;trates, that HE is the Author of that religion which the Apo&s;tles taught, as revealed by him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
IT is, I think, equally true, though not &s;o obvious, that the <Q>departure of &s;ome from the faith,</Q> the corruption of Chri&s;tianity which has prevailed, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, with|out regard to its having been predicted, far from indicating the fal&s;ity of this religion, is a &s;trong pre&s;umption of its being a true religion. For it will appear, on examination, to be one mark of di&s;tinction between true and fal&s;e religions, That always the former are corrupted, and the latter improved, by lenth of time. Both the parts of this propo&s;ition are &s;u&s;ceptible of the fulle&s;t evidence: And, in pur&s;uing the argu|ment, I &s;hall &s;tate the evidence of both, and then deduce the conclu&s;ions which they war|rant.</P>
<P N="1">I. FIRST, I &s;hall &s;hew, that univer&s;ally and invariably true religions have, in cour&s;e of time, degenerated and been corrupted. They are only three, the primeval religion of man|kind, the Jewi&s;h, and the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="1">1. I BEGIN with the primeval religion of mankind. But what was this? The generali|ty of infidels will eagerly an&s;wer, Pure natural
<PB N="5" REF="7">
religion. If it was, they will certainly ac|knowledge that this was a true religion: and that it was early and univer&s;ally corrupted in a mi&s;erable manner, they cannot deny.</P>
<P>One of them, however, far &s;uperior in pene|tration to the re&s;t, is &s;ingular in a&s;&s;erting, that <Q>polythei&s;m or idolatry was, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have been, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ancient religion of mankind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, Di&s;&s;ert. i. &sect; 1.</NOTE>;</Q> and he endeavours to &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion both by rea&s;onings, and from hi&s;tory.&mdash;On &s;uppo&s;ition, that the fir&s;t men were left to &s;earch out their religion by the powers of una&s;&s;i&s;ted Nature, his <HI>rea&s;onings</HI> would perhaps be &s;olid: and, by producing them, he has exploded the favourite po&s;itions of his more re&s;erved brethren, concerning the &s;uf|ficiency of rea&s;on, the plainne&s;s and perfection of the law of Nature, and the inutility of revelation. Indeed, conclu&s;ively as the whole of natural reli|gion may be <HI>proved</HI> by rea&s;on, yet natural reli|gion, <HI>di&s;covered</HI> by rea&s;on, was never in fact the religion of any age or nation.&mdash;In proving his a&s;|&s;ertion from <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> he has carefully omitted the expre&s;s te&s;timony of the hi&s;tory unque&s;|tionably the mo&s;t ancient in the world. How|ever
<PB N="6" REF="8">
fair, it was doubtle&s;s prudent. For, in contradiction to the far later hi&s;tories which alone he choo&s;es to quote, the Bible clearly te&s;|tifies, that the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ancient religion of mankind was, not polythei&s;m or idolatry, but the wor&s;hip of the one true God.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, it invalidates all the <HI>rea&s;onings</HI> by which he would prove that it mu&s;t have been otherwi&s;e: for it &s;uppo&s;es not that circum&s;tance, on the reality of which their whole force de|pends; but e&s;tabli&s;hes quite the rever&s;e. It &s;uppo&s;es not, that the fir&s;t rude and ignorant ge|neration of men di&s;covered this pure religion by the force of rea&s;on; and therefore is not af|fected by any of the improbabilities of this hav|ing happened, which he &s;o anxiou&s;ly enume|rates. On the contrary, it accounts for this: It affirms that they were not left to them&s;elves; that they were taught by God; that, from the very beginning, he in&s;tructed them by revela|tion; and that revelation was not only the mode of conveying to them all their religious principles, but the &s;ole &s;oundation of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to de&s;cribe the religion of the &s;tate of inno|cence.
<PB N="7" REF="9">
From the lights held out by Mo&s;es, we may, I think, collect, that the primeval religion of the lap&s;ed world included the great princi|ples of natural religion, as far as the rudene&s;s of the earlie&s;t men qualified them for appre|hending them, One perfect God, the Creator and Governor of the world, the object of their wor&s;hip and obedience; together with the in|&s;titution of the Sabbath, in memory of the creation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 2, 3.</NOTE>; an intimation of the redemption of the world <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. iii. 15.</NOTE>; and the rite of &s;acrifice <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 3, 4.</NOTE>, both as a mode of wor&s;hip, and as typical of the ap|pointed method of redemption. And, &s;o far as we know, this continued to be the form of the true religion throughout the patriarchal age, with the addition only of informations concerning the line from which the Redeemer was to &s;pring, the new promi&s;e of the land of Canaan to Abraham and his &s;eed, and the rite of circumci&s;ion as the &s;ign of God's covenant with them. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the&s;e &s;ew acce&s;&s;ions, to con&s;ider the Abra|hamic as a new religion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
THIS religion, of divine original, was in all its parts very early corrupted. Not to inquire into the antediluvian defections from it, we are certain, that before the calling of Abraham it had been very generally relinqui&s;hed; the one true God for&s;aken; fal&s;e gods introduced; the memory of the creation lo&s;t; the memorial of it, the Sabbath, neglected; the promi&s;es of redemption forgotten; and &s;acrifice, the type of it, abu&s;ed. This corruption formed pa|gani&s;m, of which every &s;ucceeding &s;pecies was wor&s;e than the preceding, and every &s;pecies be|came wor&s;e in time than it had been at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM all the accounts which we have either of ancient nations or of rude nations latterly di&s;covered, it &s;eems evident, that the wor&s;hip of the heavenly bodies is the &s;pecies of idolatry into which mankind every where fir&s;t declined. The &s;un is the mo&s;t glorious of all &s;en&s;ible ob|jects, the fountain of light and heat, the &s;ource of fertility, the cau&s;e of the revolutions of the &s;ea&s;ons. His &s;plendour and his u&s;efulne&s;s natu|rally attracted the attention of men. While they kept in mind the principles of true religion, they regarded him only as the &s;en&s;ible repre&s;en|tative
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of the one God. But, forgetting them by degrees, lo&s;ing all memory of the creation, and &s;inking deeper into &s;en&s;e, they began to a|dore him for his own &s;ake, and re&s;ted in <Q>the work,</Q> without <Q>acknowledging the work|ma&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;d. xiii. 1.</NOTE>.</Q> We know from hi&s;tory, that &s;ome nations held the &s;un to be the only lord of heaven; and it is probable that he was the fir&s;t object of idolatry in every nation. But he continued not long to be the only object of it. Other parts of Nature came to be "deemed" likewi&s;e "gods which govern the world <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 2.</NOTE>:" the le&s;s &s;plendid luminaries, the moon and the &s;tars; the earth; the elements, fire, wind, and thunder; whatever either promoted or ob|&s;tructed men's enjoyment of the productions of Nature; became gradually the objects of their adoration. Thus, degenerating continually, they multiplied their gods, till at length they numbered among them almo&s;t every thing u&s;e|ful and every thing hurtful.&mdash;In the beginning of this idolatry, their ritual was &s;imple, expre&s;|&s;ive only of their reverence <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxi. 27.</NOTE>. It was nece&s;|&s;arily increa&s;ed with the number of their gods;
<PB N="10" REF="12">
they came to be wor&s;hiped by artificial &s;ymbol~s, or by fire; and into the ritual of every god, many &s;illy ceremonies were introduced: from trivial they grew ab&s;urd; they degenerated in|to cruelty; they terminated in human &s;acri|fices.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;pecies of idolatry, the wor&s;hip of dead men deified, was early introduced by the pa&s;&s;ions of men. E&s;teem of a revered pa|rent &s;welled into adoration: affection led to <Q>honour as a god the child &s;oon taken a|way <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;d. xiv. 15.</NOTE>.</Q> The e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil &s;ociety and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive inventions of arts gave it a rapid progre&s;s: veneration, gratitude, admiration, rai&s;ed the founders of &s;tates, the authors of u&s;eful di&s;coveries, public benefactors, illu&s;trious kings, rulers, and warriors, after their death, into divinities.&mdash;This &s;pecies of idolatry was in every re&s;pect wor&s;e than the former. It did not all at once bani&s;h that, but was &s;uperadded to, or incorporated with it: to be&s;tow plau|&s;ibility on the wor&s;hip of their con&s;ecrated hero, they gave him the name, and inve&s;ted him with
<PB N="11" REF="13">
the government, of &s;ome of the cele&s;tial bodies; O&s;iris by the Egyptians, and Belus by the A&s;|&s;yrians, was called the &s;un; by degrees, the planets, the earth, the &s;ea, the air, moun|tains, rivers, almo&s;t every part of Nature, had &s;ome deity attached to it. Their fal&s;e gods were therefore multiplied: and, by being con|ceived, &s;ometimes as a part of Nature, and &s;ome|times as its pre&s;iding god, confu&s;ion and in|con&s;i&s;tence were introduced into the character and attributes of each.&mdash;The mo&s;t &s;tupenduous parts of Nature, though unworthy of our wor|&s;hip, are de&s;erving of our highe&s;t admiration; were they animated, they mu&s;t be deemed far more glorious than human creatures: but, mi|&s;erable is the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing dead men to be immortal gods.&mdash;The former were uni|ver&s;al deities: the latter only local, contracted|ly limited in their attachments and their opera|tion.&mdash;The introduction of them accumulated &s;uper&s;titious rites of wor&s;hip: it required nu|merous and complex ceremonies, expre&s;&s;ive of the character, the exploits, or the benefits of each hero god.</P>
<P>This form of polythei&s;m, bad at fir&s;t, &s;till grew wor&s;e.&mdash;The number of their gods was
<PB N="12" REF="14">
continually increa&s;ed, till, in every nation, it became enormous. The fir&s;t gods had pro|bably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable merit in their mor|tal &s;tate; and, in their immortal, were conceiv|ed watchful, for promoting virtue, in their &s;eve|ral provinces: but afterwards, multitudes were deified without a pretence to any merit; and many who&s;e vices rendered them infamous and execrable. Heaven was crowded with aban|doned wretches unfit to be tolerated on earth. Additions were made to the hi&s;tory of each god, till their mythology became a huge ma&s;s of in|con&s;i&s;tencies and indecencies. The characters and deeds of their divinities would have di&s;|graced humanity, and held forth examples and patrons for every crime. With tho&s;e whom they &s;uppo&s;ed removed into the heavens, they at length proceeded to a&s;&s;ociate &s;ome of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of the living; rai&s;ing altars and paying divine honours, with the mo&s;t abject a|dulation, to tho&s;e at who&s;e cruelty they trem|bled, and who&s;e profligacy they could not be|hold without abhorrence.&mdash;For &s;ome time their devotion was directed &s;olely to their invi&s;ible gods; Homer gives no hint of the u&s;e of images, and for &s;ome ages the Romans had
<PB N="13" REF="15">
none: their wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted wholly in pray|ers, hymns, and &s;acrifices. But growing &s;uper|&s;tition &s;oon demanded &s;tatues of the gods, and plunged its infatuated votaries into the &s;hame|ful folly of adoring the works of their own hands, <Q>falling down to the &s;tock of a tree <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xliv. 19.</NOTE>, &s;peaking to that which hath no life, calling for health upon that which is weak, praying for life to that which is dead, and for a good journey a&s;king that which cannot &s;et a foot forward <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;d. xiii. 17, 18.</NOTE>.</Q> Their religious rites were mul|tiplied and complicated: &s;uitably to the imper|fection of their gods, they were &s;ometimes meanly flattering, &s;ometimes outrageou&s;ly abu|&s;ive; and &s;uitably to their different characters, many of them became madly riotous, abomi|nably impure, or inhumanly barbarous.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t degeneracy of the primeval reli|ligion, was the wor&s;hip of brutes and inani|mate things, which prevailed chiefly among the Egyptians and their colonies. That it was the mo&s;t dete&s;tible form of Pagani&s;m, it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;pend time in evincing: And it pro|ceeded
<PB N="14" REF="16">
from evil to wor&s;e.&mdash;It &s;eems to have ari&s;en from the hi&s;tory of their hero-gods be|ing recorded in hieroglyphics; in which the fi|gures of brutes and vegetables were employed as the marks or &s;ymbols of their &s;everal attri|butes and exploits. Fond of their hierogly|phics, they &s;ub&s;tituted the&s;e &s;ymbols of their divinities, in place of the images of them in hu|man &s;hape, which had been u&s;ed formerly. The &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations were engraved in their temples; and by being con&s;tantly in their view while they wor&s;hipped their god, they became clo&s;ely a&s;&s;ociated with him in their imaginations, and &s;hared in their wor&s;hip: they engaged the readier and the greater vene|neration by being con&s;idered as in&s;tituted by the god him&s;elf.&mdash;Accu&s;tomed in this manner to venerate the figure of a plant or animal, they came by a very ea&s;y &s;tep to hold the real one &s;acred, as at lea&s;t a &s;ymbol of the god: And next, forgetting that it was but a &s;ymbol, they adored it as it&s;elf divine.&mdash;Each &s;ymbol had different &s;ignifications; and each attribute was repre&s;ented by different &s;ymbols: in con|&s;equence of the&s;e two circum&s;tances together, their animal and vegetable deities were multi|plied,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
till they comprehended whatever had any quality remarkable enough to fit it for being an hieroglyphic. For expre&s;&s;ing complex no|tions, in this kind of writing, they had unit|ed the parts and members of different &s;pecies; and hence mon&s;ters and chimeras were added to the number of their gods.</P>
<P>INSTEAD, therefore, of <Q>finding mankind the more plunged into idolatry, the farther we mount up into antiquity; and no marks, no &s;ymptoms of any more perfect religion,</Q> as has been confidently a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, ib.</NOTE> to be clear from the te&s;timony of hi&s;tory; we are a&s;&s;ured by the olde&s;t of hi&s;tories, that in the remote&s;t antiquity a more perfect religion, the acknow|ledgment and wor&s;hip of the One God, did prevail: and not only from it, but from the writings &s;till extant in every kind, we learn with certainty, that from this religion mankind deviated only by degrees, and were not plung|ed into the lowe&s;t degradations of idolatry but in the cour&s;e of ages. In Greece, the polythe|i&s;m of the heroic times was, for its purity and
<PB N="16" REF="18">
moral influence, venerable in compari&s;on with the ma&s;s of &s;uper&s;titions, which compo&s;ed its religion in its mo&s;t civilized and enlightened periods.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE next true religion given to the world, was the Jewi&s;h. It may be viewed in two different lights; as the religious &s;y&s;tem of the Hebrew nation; and as a preparation for the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. In re&s;pect of both it was, by the Jews, gradually corrupted from its original purity: but with circum&s;tances &s;o different, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to mark them &s;eparately.</P>
<P>CONSIDERED in the former light, it contains that &s;y&s;tem of belief and that body of laws and wor&s;hip, which Mo&s;es delivered to the I&s;|raelites: and it was completed by the dige&s;t which he gave them; all &s;ucceeding prie&s;ts and prophets and rulers being only the guardians, the interpreters, or the executioners of it, but having no authority to alter or to add to it. The Mo&s;aical religion, viewed in this light, was, The acknowledgment of the One God, as both the God of the univer&s;e, and their peculiar God
<PB N="17" REF="19">
and righteous Governour; and the wor&s;hip of him by a multifarious ceremonial, accurately determined by his authority.</P>
<P>It was by the intermixture of idolatry, that the I&s;raelites corrupted the purity of this reli|gion. They began with wor&s;hiping God by an image; and that very early: the golden "calf," the Egyptian repre&s;entative of O&s;iris, they pre|vailed on Aaron to "fa&s;hion" for a vi&s;ible re|pre&s;entative of Jehovah <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They did not long di&s;continue the impiety. When the mother of Micah had founded &s;ilver into images, &s;he re|garded this as "dedicating it to Jehovah <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. xvii. 3.</NOTE>:" when Micah had got "a Levite" to officiate as "prie&s;t" before his images, he confidently pro|mi&s;ed him&s;elf, on that account, the favour of Jehovah <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 13.</NOTE>. By this prie&s;t, the children of Dan "a&s;ked coun&s;el of Jehovah: <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xviii. 5, 6.</NOTE>" they after|wards carried him away with the images, and &s;et them up; and "Jonathan" the grand&s;on of Mo&s;es, "and his &s;ons," continued for a long time the "prie&s;ts" in this idolatrous &s;er|vice <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 18,&mdash;30.</NOTE>. This wor&s;hip of the true God by
<PB N="18" REF="20">
images, was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom of I&s;rael, by the "calves" which, for preventing the peo|ple from going out of its territory to wor&s;hip, were "&s;et up at Dan and Bethel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE>:" and it continued as long as that kingdom &s;tood.&mdash;The introduction of images brought along with it the u&s;e of other forbidden modes. Co-eval with it was their wor&s;hipping in forbidden places: <Q>the hou&s;e of the Lord was at Shilo, all the time</Q> that <Q>Jonathan and his &s;ons were prie&s;ts</Q> to the tribe of Dan <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. xviii. 30, 31.</NOTE>: the temple was at Jeru&s;alem, when the ten tribes &s;acrificed to their idols in the two extremities of their country: their "high places," their "mountains," their "groves," and their "green trees," are frequently mentioned with cen&s;ure. In time they adopted likewi&s;e "rites" di&s;allowed by their law, mixing with their wor|&s;hip of the true God, ceremonies which their neighbours u&s;ed in &s;erving fal&s;e gods.</P>
<P>They were not content with the&s;e corrup|tions: they took fal&s;e gods into partner&s;hip with Jehovah, and wor&s;hipped them in conjunc|tion with him. While they were yet <Q>in the
<PB N="19" REF="21">

While the Sadducees &s;prung up, &s;ceptics or infidels with re&s;pect to important articles of faith, the re&s;t plunged them&s;elves into &s;uper&s;tition or fanatici&s;m.

They &s;ubtilized on their moral pre|cepts, till they explained them away, and ren|dered them compatible with every vice.

<P>CONSIDERED in the &s;econd light, as a pre|paration for the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, the Jew|i&s;h religion, be&s;ides the types involved in its ce|remonial, and the notices of the de&s;ign of re|demption which had been given before the time of Mo&s;es, comprehended a long &s;eries of prophecies concerning it, was gradually reared by their unfolding more and more the nature of that di&s;pen&s;ation, and was completed only when Malachi the la&s;t of the prophets had written. It is from that period, that the cor|ruption of this part of the religion of the I&s;raelites commenced: and it has become ex|treme.</P>
<P>Mi&s;under&s;tanding their &s;criptures, and over|looking many prophetical intimations, they per|&s;uaded them&s;elves that their religion was per|fect, and in all its parts unchangeable and per|petual. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this idea, they could con|ceive no u&s;e for a Me&s;&s;iah, but to extend it to all nations: and warped by worldly pa&s;&s;ions, they &s;uppo&s;ed that he would effectuate this, as a
<PB N="23" REF="25">
glorious and triumphant prince, exalting them to the &s;ummit of temporal pro&s;perity, and bringing the whole earth into &s;ubjection to them. Mi&s;led by the&s;e fal&s;e notions, by them explaining whatever &s;eemed reconcileable, and neglecting whatever was repugnant, they were led into greater mi&s;conception of the prophe|cies. They found not in Je&s;us the character which they expected; they rejected and they cruci&s;ied him.</P>
<P>They have remained &s;tubborn. They were early accu&s;ed of era&s;ing &s;ome predictions; they have been often charged with wilfully fal&s;ify|ing &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages. The charge has been car|ried too far: but that in a few in&s;tances they have attempted it, that in more they have purpo&s;ely preferred fal&s;e readings ca&s;ually in|troduced, to &s;uch as are unque&s;tionably ge|nuine, but more favourable to Chri&s;tianity, there &s;eems to be evidence. It is certain that Daniel, whom their fathers ranked among the prophets, and from whom alone they learned the name MESSIAH, they have, only becau&s;e his predictions are the mo&s;t preci&s;e, for many ages denied to be a prophet.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">
In perverting the meaning of the prophecies, they have been indefatigable. The cleare&s;t predictions concerning the Me&s;&s;iah and his kingdom, and by the Jews before his coming owned to be clear, they &s;oon after began to deny, and have per&s;i&s;ted in denying to have any relation to him; many which even their own early traditions refer to him, their later writers wre&s;t from their intent: And they ap|ply them to other per&s;ons and events, concern|ing which they cannot agree among them&s;elves, but in none of which imagination it&s;elf can find them verified; nay to events forged on purpo&s;e to &s;erve as an accompli&s;hment of them, and which may be di&s;proved from their own traditions.&mdash;Having devi&s;ed &s;uch &s;emblances of their accompli&s;hment in others, they deny that they give any intimation of the Me&s;&s;iah. While in the plaine&s;t parts of Scripture, hi&s;tory and precept, the nature of which can admit no|thing beyond the obvious literal meaning, they are licentious in deducing my&s;teries, the mo&s;t chimerical and ridiculous, from letters, and points, and ca&s;ual or capricious modes and cir|cum&s;tances of writing; they ob&s;tinately deny that in prophecy, the nature of which admits
<PB N="25" REF="27">
and even invites it, there are any &s;econdary &s;en|&s;es, any intimations, under types, of a higher archetype; nay, they in&s;i&s;t on interpreting lite|rally expre&s;&s;ions evidently figurative and meta|phorical, the import of which is clearly a&s;cer|tained by the whole analogy of &s;cripture lan|guage. In the predictions of the Me&s;&s;iah's glo|ry, they can perceive only worldly greatne&s;s; but neither the important object of his fir&s;t co|ming, nor the maje&s;ty of his &s;econd. They deny that his kingdom can be &s;piritual, becau&s;e its whole nature was not as preci&s;ely and as ex|plicitly predefined by the prophets, as it could be delineated by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>For eluding the force of prophecy, they have &s;tuck at no expedient. To reconcile to their ideas, predictions of &s;ufferings and death, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the plaine&s;t terms, de&s;cribed in the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial manner, and unequivocally pointed to the Me&s;&s;iah, they ages &s;ince devi&s;|ed the fiction, contradictory to traditions pre|&s;erved by them&s;elves, of two Me&s;&s;iahs. All the predictions concerning the reception of the Gentiles to equal privileges with them&s;elves, they have diluted into notices that the nations were to be their &s;ubjects. They have li&s;tened
<PB N="26" REF="28">
to one impo&s;tor after another, without a &s;ingle feature of the true Me&s;&s;iah: they have fixed aera after aera for his appearance: Di&s;appointed in them all, they contrive un&s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons for its being delayed: and while they convert the ab&s;olute predictions of his coming into con|ditional promi&s;es, they mi&s;interpret the promi&s;e of their being ble&s;&s;ed in him, clearly &s;u&s;pended on the condition of their receiving him, and ac|companied with intimations, owned by their early doctors, that but a &s;mall part of I&s;rael would be actually &s;aved by him, into ab&s;olute predictions of their univer&s;al &s;alvation; the failure of which they hold forth as a demon&s;tra|tion that he is not yet come.</P>
<P>To fortify them&s;elves in unbelief, they have not &s;crupled to extenuate the idolatry of their ance&s;tors; to pronounce outward ceremonial wor&s;hip more excellent than inward piety and moral virtue; to affirm that the Me&s;&s;iah was promi&s;ed &s;olely as a king, not as a law-giver, nor &s;o much as to reveal any thing new; to deny that they are required, in order to their &s;alvation, to believe in him when he comes: and indeed they leave &s;carcely any foundation in the prophecies, for them&s;elves or their fa|thers

ever expecting that a Me&s;&s;iah was to come.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE third true religion is the Chri&s;tian. The New te&s;tament exhibits it in its purity. That it has been grievou&s;ly corrupted, infidels glory in proclaiming, and Chri&s;tians are no|wi&s;e concerned to di&s;&s;emble. Every hi&s;tory of the church bears te&s;timony to the fact, and di&s;|clo&s;es the nature and the progre&s;s of its depra|vation. In a ca&s;e of &s;uch notoriety, a very brief &s;ketch will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>By being blended with the ideas and &s;pecu|lations of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, the &s;imple doctrines of the Go&s;pel began very early to be adulte|rated. From that philo&s;ophy, &s;ubtileties were borrowed for defining them with preci&s;ion, and hypothe&s;es for explaining them; and new ones were continually invented. Di&s;cordant defini|tions were adopted, and tenaciou&s;ly maintained. Controver&s;ies concerning them were agitated with heat, and debated with all the arts of mi&s;|applied acutene&s;s. Every controver&s;y produc|ed contradictory deci&s;ions by tho&s;e who equally u&s;urped authority to fix the faith of Chri&s;tians. Every deci&s;ion engendered new controver&s;ies,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
and inflamed &s;iercer contentions. Inve&s;tigation was &s;tretched to inquiries above the reach of man, and pro&s;tituted to frivolous que&s;tions and logomachies unworthy of his notice. By &s;uch deci&s;ions as had the good fortune to predo|minate, new creeds were continually fabricated; new terms of di&s;tinction con&s;ecrated&punc; the heads of doctrine, the articles of faith, unrea&s;onably multiplied; many fal&s;e doctrines e&s;tabli&s;hed. To give them &s;upport, divine authority was more and more attributed to human writings; and all the jargon of &s;chola&s;tic metaphy&s;ics, and all the &s;ophi&s;try of dialectics, were laboriou&s;ly employed.</P>
<P>In proportion as the doctrines of the go&s;pel were tortured from their original &s;implicity, in|to endle&s;s intricacies of frigid refinement, they became un&s;it for touching the heart or influencing the practice, for &s;erving as motives to holine&s;s, as roots from which piety and vir|tue might derive nouri&s;hment and vigour. The precepts, likewi&s;e, of the Go&s;pel, who&s;e &s;im|plicity gives them a venerable dignity and a commanding authority, were explained and analized with a dry minutene&s;s, better calculat|ed for perplexing the under&s;tanding, than for
<PB N="29" REF="31">
impre&s;&s;ing them on the con&s;cience. They were avowedly evaded by maxims of loo&s;e ca|&s;ui&s;try; and their obligation &s;uper&s;eded by &s;u|per&s;titious commutations, penances, indulgences, and di&s;pen&s;ations. Perfection was placed, not in &s;ub&s;tantial goodne&s;s, but in celibacy, mona|chi&s;m, voluntary au&s;terities, and unnatural mor|tifications.</P>
<P>The &s;imple wor&s;hip of Chri&s;tianity was &s;oon deformed by the admixture, fir&s;t of Jewi&s;h, and next of Pagan ceremonies. Bapti&s;m and the euchari&s;t were admini&s;tered with empty pa|geantry and idle mummery; they were trans|formed into terrific my&s;teries; new virtues were a&s;cribed to them; new pomp was em|ployed in &s;olemnizing them; the corruption of the latter i&s;&s;ued in the mon&s;ter, tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion. To the few rites enjoined by the Go&s;|pel, many were added; and from unnece&s;&s;ary, they became abominable: from <Q>glorying in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 14.</NOTE>,</Q> they pa&s;&s;ed to u&s;ing the &s;ign of it, as a charm, on all occa&s;ions; from praying for the dead, they proceeded to pray to them; from commemorating the mar|tyrs,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to wor&s;hip them; from re&s;pecting their relics, to adore them, and to indue them with the power of miracles; from tolerating pictures and images, fir&s;t to place them in churches, and afterwards to fall down before them. Fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals without number were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in&s;ti|tuted. Prayers, in the beginning &s;hort and artle&s;s, were extended into complex liturgies, infected with all the niceties and errors of their faith.</P>
<P>The genuine &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity has been no le&s;s wofully depraved. The Apo&s;tles, though in&s;pired, claimed no "dominion over faith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 24.</NOTE>;" they in&s;i&s;ted on the reception only of what was clearly revealed; they gave indulgence to hu|man weakne&s;s in whatever affected not the very e&s;&s;ence of religion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 1, &amp;c. Phil. iii. 15, 16.</NOTE>; they re&s;erved their ana|themas for ob&s;tinate wickedne&s;s. But they who came after them, from almo&s;t the earlie&s;t time, have impo&s;ed upon others their own precarious opinions, their determinations concerning what is not revealed; their far-fetched deductions from Scripture; and even the technical terms which they had coined for expre&s;&s;ing them.
<PB N="31" REF="33">
They have &s;eparated from, and excommunicated, one another for the mo&s;t trifling, nay for ver|bal differences; and, while they were indulgent to crimes, denounced damnation again&s;t what|ever they were plea&s;ed to denominate here&s;y.&mdash;As &s;oon as the conver&s;ion of the emperors put it in their power, the leaders of the church gra&s;ped at riches, dignities, and political influence. Cle|rical orders were multiplied: the bi&s;hops a&s;&s;um|ed a high rank: archbi&s;hops and patriarchs ex|alted them&s;elves above them: each &s;ee was not only &s;crambled for with indecent ambition, but purcha&s;ed by the ba&s;e&s;t arts; and one &s;ee contended with another, for pre-eminence to flatter pride, and power to domineer.&mdash;In all the churches the&s;e evils grew, till the dexterous and per&s;evering efforts of the bi&s;hop of Rome rai&s;ed him to &s;upremacy over mo&s;t of them, &s;ub|jected the kings of the world to his nod, made him the vicar of Chri&s;t, a god upon earth, and ve&s;ted him with ab&s;olute dominion, which he mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in tyrannizing over all, in di&s;turbing the peace, and di&s;&s;olving the laws of &s;ociety, in authorizing all former cor|ruptions and making great additions to them in enforcing them by per&s;ecutions, ma&s;&s;acres,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
and wars, in degrading religion into an engine of the mo&s;t unrighteous policy.</P>
<P>In a word, from &s;mall beginnings, number|le&s;s corruptions, aided by centuries of igno|rance, grew up into that <Q>my&s;tery of iniqui|ty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. ii. 7.</NOTE>,</Q> which formed the predominant reli|gion at the Reformation, the total depravation of which is &s;o well known, and &s;o explicitly confe&s;&s;ed by popi&s;h writers them&s;elves, that I may &s;pare my&s;elf the pain of attempting the odious portrait.</P>
<P>THUS every religion that has any claim to truth, has been in time corrupted.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE SECOND part of our propo&s;ition, That all fal&s;e religions have, in time, been a|mended and improved, is equally true; and, &s;o far as our pre&s;ent de&s;ign requires it, may be more briefly evinced. Each of the deprava|tions which we have mentioned, having at length acquired a determinate &s;hape, became a fal&s;e religion, for &s;ome time prevalent, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and unque&s;tioned. But in the progre&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="35">
of inquiry and knowledge, they have been all examined, cleared in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s which they had gradually contracted, and reduced to a le&s;s exceptionable form.</P>
<P N="1">1. TO begin with pagani&s;m. The Egyptian wor&s;hip of brutes and vegetables a&s;toni&s;hed the inqui&s;itive: it &s;hocked the idolaters of other &s;ects; it was oftener than once legally pro&s;crib|ed by the Romans, who gloried in adopting the gods and the rites of all nations, as a token of their piety and the cau&s;e of their pro&s;peri|ty: it could &s;carcely fail &s;ometimes to &s;tag|ger its own votaries. They extenuated its ab|&s;urdity, by re&s;olving the ignoble objects of their adoration into mere emblems both of hero|gods and of the cele&s;tial bodies, the divinities acknowledged by all idolaters. Emblems they had originally been: but by ingenuity in illu&s;trat|ing their &s;ignificance, they were rendered more plau&s;ible than at their introduction, and repre|&s;ented as even more refined and expre&s;&s;ive images of the gods, than the idols &s;et up by other pagans.</P>
<P>THE wor&s;hip of dead men, however implicit|ly and exten&s;ively practi&s;ed, could not, naked
<PB N="34" REF="36">
and undi&s;gui&s;ed, e&s;cape condemnation as &s;oon as it had excited the curio&s;ity of thinking men. Even the &s;ymbolical images of the Egyptians, it has been &s;peciou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, were contrived on purpo&s;e to veil the objectionable genealogies of the gods. To give that wor&s;hip the &s;airer appearance, &s;peculative men devi&s;ed the di&s;tinc|tion of &s;ouls, into human, heroic, and demo|niac: when the gods were conceived, not as or|dinary mortals, but as Superior Beings who had deigned to vi&s;it the earth for the &s;ake of man|kind, and lived only to heap ble&s;&s;ings on them, there was a &s;hew of rea&s;on in paying them reli|gious honours. This hypothe&s;is was, however, contradicted by their mythology, which proved their gods to have been mere men, often not of the worthie&s;t kind; and the authority of their admired poets had early rendered this too &s;a|cred to be rejected: but they explained it away, and repre&s;ented the popular hi&s;tories of the gods as only ingenious allegories, &s;hadowing forth moral or phy&s;ical truths.</P>
<P>AT an early period, in the mo&s;t civilized na|tions of the ea&s;t, the more enlightened wor&s;hip|ers of the cele&s;tial bodies reformed the received
<PB N="35" REF="37">
idolatry, &s;o far as to confine their adoration to the &s;un, and, reprobating images, to addre&s;s him by no other medium but fire.&mdash;When, in other nations, the elements, and even the mo&s;t &s;plendid luminaries were, by the re&s;earches of philo&s;ophers, a&s;certained to be inanimate, the wor&s;hip of them required a vindication: and it was attempted by the refinement of re|ferring it, not to the material ma&s;s, but to the intelligent divinity who inhabited and govern|ed it.</P>
<P>BUT none of the forms of pagani&s;m, how|ever each of them might be di&s;gui&s;ed, or how|ever the ab&s;urdities of them all might be &s;hu&s;&s;led out of &s;ight by involving them in confu&s;ion, blending them together, and deriving &s;upport to one from another in their turns, could bear the &s;crutiny of enlightened minds. Without entering into the controverted import of the my&s;teries, we may remark that the &s;peculations of the old philo&s;ophers of Greece forced them to acknowledge One &s;upreme God, di&s;tinct from all the vulgar deities, though along with him they continued to admit the&s;e. But the lu&s;tre of religious truth diffu&s;ed by the go&s;pel,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
con&s;trained the later philo&s;ophers to acknow|ledge him as the Only God; and, determined as they were not to relinqui&s;h the popular re|ligion, to endeavour by a new refinement to render it con&s;i&s;tent with that acknowledgment. Even the brute-gods of Egypt were made only emblematical of his &s;everal attributes; the fables of their hero-gods, but parabolical hi&s;tories of his providence; the dei&s;ied parts of nature, no more than his &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entatives; all their rites, a varied &s;ervice to him under different names, or different ideas. Their idolatries thus explained away by a reference to the true God, gave pagani&s;m the mo&s;t unexceptionable form of which it was capable.&mdash;In &s;ome countries, this refinement re&s;ted not with philo|&s;ophers. Whether in an early age, by means of the Jewi&s;h &s;criptures, or at a later era, by the publication of the Alcoran, the Magian re|ligion of the ea&s;t was much reformed; one &s;u|preme and eternal God introduced; the wor|&s;hip of him alone e&s;tabli&s;hed by books account|ed divine; and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o firmly that its vo|taries, though full of &s;uper&s;titions, continue to dete&s;t idolatry, and pro&s;e&s;&s;edly wor&s;hip before the fire or towards the ri&s;ing &s;un, only as the
<PB N="37" REF="39">
pure&s;t types of the Divinity. Nay in almo&s;t all the popular religions of A&s;ia, we are in|formed that, amid&s;t numberle&s;s ab&s;urdities, and idolatrous u&s;ages, One God is ultimately adored.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE religion of the I&s;raelites &s;ophi&s;ticated as it was by idolatry, before the captivity, may ju&s;tly be called fal&s;e. From that idolatry, it has ever &s;ince been completely purged: and their pre&s;ent ritual, with all its deformities, is far preferable to the heatheni&s;h inventions of their ance&s;tors.&mdash;Whether, or how far, the doctrine of the Jews concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, has been amended &s;ince their rejection of him, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to examine. As their unbe|lief is founded on the mo&s;t rooted prejudices and the mo&s;t determined mi&s;under&s;tanding of the prophecies, it is only from very extraordi|nary events that their conver&s;ion can be expect|ed; and till it take place there can be little al|teration in their &s;entiments concerning Chri&s;t. For this, the predicted time is not yet come&punc; but when it comes, their conver&s;ion will be perfect; all their errors will be relinqui&s;hed; as national, their religion will cea&s;e; as divine,
<PB N="38" REF="40">

By the revival of learning, and by the application of it to an examination of the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, its errors have been much corrected.</P>
<P>Even by tho&s;e who &s;till adhered to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of it, it has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|fined.

The reading of the &s;criptures has been more freely permitted to the people; and by vernacular ver&s;ions and expo&s;itions, means are &s;upplied for their better under&s;tanding them. Every where the horrors of the inqui&s;ition have have been mitigated; in &s;ome places they have cea&s;ed. Among the mo&s;t bigotted nations, di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions which once would have been repre&s;&s;ed by the executioner, begin to be ventured on with impunity, and li&s;tened to without ha|zard: and in nations more enlightened, free inquiry is encouraged and pur&s;ued with ar|dour. A liberal toleration has been, not only recommended by the learned, and granted by di&s;cerning princes, but approved by the multi|tude, practi&s;ed by prie&s;ts, and even indulged by popes. Their authority, both &s;piritual and temporal, has come to be very faintly &s;ubmit|ted to, and very cautiou&s;ly exerci&s;ed. Some religious orders, u&s;ele&s;s or noxious, have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and others re&s;tricted, or reformed.</P>

But among tho&s;e who &s;eparated from the church of Rome, a far more important re&s;tora|tion of pure Chri&s;tianity has taken place. By the fir&s;t reformers, the &s;cripture was recogniz|ed as the only rule of religious faith and prac|tice: and to the inve&s;tigation of its genuine &s;en&s;e they applied all the means of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with &s;ucce&s;s in their cir|cum&s;tances a&s;toni&s;hing.

deci&s;ions; they were too ea&s;ily and too deeply irritated by contradiction to the&s;e: by aiming at an impracticable uniformity, they broke that union which they ought to have pre&s;erved. By an abu&s;e of liberty, to which they who have newly acquired it are ever prone, crude conceits, wild notions, and ex|travagant practices were &s;ometimes vented; and &s;ects founded on them, &s;ome of which, after fla&s;hing for a while, vani&s;hed away, and &s;ome, throwing off the gro&s;&s;er matter, have a&s;&s;umed a more decent form.&mdash;All the defects of the fir&s;t reformation are not yet &s;upplied; many cau&s;es have concurred in preventing it: but &s;ome of them have been in part removed; and for the removal of them all, there &s;eems to be a hap|py preparation. New means of elucidating &s;cripture are every day di&s;covered and employ|ed: there is a very general di&s;po&s;ition among prote&s;tants to examine with impartiality what it really teaches: the fallible determinations and deductions of men are le&s;s implicitly revered: &s;ome doctrines have come to be explained more &s;oberly: many frivolous controver&s;ies are ex|ploded, and the more important que&s;tions are often debated with coolne&s;s and candour: le&s;s

the more, becau&s;e it &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight unfavourable to our po&s;ition, but on in&s;pecting the peculiarity of its origin and &s;tructure, will turn out a remarkable confirmation of it. We had no occa&s;ion to mention it under the former head; for it was not a natural and gradual de|pravation of any one true religion. It was a &s;tu|died compo&s;ition from Judai&s;m, Chri&s;tianity, and the heathen &s;uper&s;&s;itions of Arabia, pro|jected and formed by one man, and fixed by a written &s;tandard.

<P>Since religions wholly true have always been in time depraved, what this impo&s;ture had in common with them, already in the fir&s;t deli|very tainted, could not but be liable to farther depravation.

Mahomet had borrowed from the &s;criptures; many moral precepts in tolerable purity; but &s;ome of them have been deba&s;ed by his follow|ers. In the beginning, he claimed a right only to admoni&s;h and per&s;uade; but he &s;oon &s;tript his religion of this gentle &s;pirit, by declaring him&s;elf authori&s;ed to compel a&s;&s;ent and exter|minate all oppo&s;ers, and commanding his di&s;|ciples to do the &s;ame. Their hatred of Chri|&s;tianity has &s;ometimes led them to deny things favourable to it, which he admitted. Many parts of the Alcoran are corruptions of &s;cripture hi&s;to|ries: if the&s;e have been more corrupted &s;ince; if multitudes of fables have been added to them; or if tenets originally fal&s;e, have been rendered more ab&s;urd; if, for example, a &s;en&s;ual paradi&s;e has been de&s;cribed in more di&s;&s;olute terms; this is only that declen&s;ion from bad to wor&s;e, which has happened in all fal&s;e religions during the prevalence of ignorance, and gone on till they reached the extreme&s;t point of their dege|neracy.&mdash;Mahomet alleged no open miracles in &s;upport of his mi&s;&s;ion, and appealed not to any clear prediction of him in the extant &s;crip|tures: ought we to reckon it a deteriora|tion, or a melioration of his &s;cheme, that his
<PB N="45" REF="47">
followers have marked his birth and early life with prodigies and pre&s;ages, a&s;cribed to him thou&s;ands of miracles, and attempted to di&s;co|ver intimations of his coming in the bible as it &s;tands? Being fictions, they add to the fal|&s;ities of Mahometani&s;m: could they be made plau&s;ible, they would &s;upply its total want of evidence.</P>
<P>But &s;ome real amendments it has unque&s;tion|ably received. They were begun even by its author: having employed more than twenty years in completing the Alcoran, he corrected errors in what had been fir&s;t written, re&s;olved difficulties, and obviated objections; and &s;alved the practice from the charge of incon&s;i&s;tency, by giving the re&s;ult of his maturer reflection or growing experience, as new revelations revok|ing the former ones. His followers have la|boured to reconcile &s;ome of the contradictions which were left remaining in it: they have &s;oftened or explained away &s;ome of its mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdities, as its exclu&s;ion of women from paradi&s;e. They have &s;upplied many de|fects in its laws, and in many ca&s;es the inter|pretations of the doctors are better than the text. Mahomet enjoined his followers to
<PB N="46" REF="48">
extirpate all other religions by the &s;word, and for &s;ome time they executed the mandate in its utmo&s;t rigour: but even the ferocious Sara|cens &s;oon adopted le&s;s bloody maxims; the Per&s;ians lay other religions under very moderate re&s;traints; and the Turks have indulged tole|ration &s;o far that, in the very vicinity of their capital, a Chri&s;tian church has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for ages, oppre&s;&s;ed indeed, though even this more from avarice than from religious zeal, but &s;uf|fered to retain its con&s;titution and its wor&s;hip, and to regulate its own concerns; nay, by &s;ome of their conque&s;ts, prote&s;tants have re|covered the liberty and ea&s;e, of which the bi|gotry of papi&s;ts had before totally deprived them.</P>
<P>That this fal&s;e religion has not been more exten&s;ively reformed, during &s;o con&s;iderable a length of time, may be ea&s;ily accounted for. Its very nature tends to depre&s;s and contract the under&s;tanding; and the de&s;poti&s;m which has con&s;tantly accompanied it, aggravates its effect. The powers of its votaries thus degrad|ed, they can have little propen&s;ity to inquiry or examination; and from this they are, though not ab&s;olutely prohibited, yet &s;trongly di&s;cou|raged

by the maxims of their prophet and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

Glimmerings of know|ledge have led &s;ome of its adherents to detect its gro&s;&s;e&s;t faults; and a general diffu&s;ion of even the &s;ainte&s;t dawn of literature would lead them either to attempt reforming it, or to re|nounce it.</P>
<P>Founded as this religion is in impo&s;ture, and contaminated as it is in its compo&s;ition, it has already, by the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom of God's providence, been over-ruled to produce many good effects; to put an end to idolatry in the country where it &s;prung up, to improve the religions of A&s;ia, to &s;pread far the doctrine of the divine unity; as well as to cha&s;ti&s;e the divi&s;ions, the &s;uper&s;titions, and the vices of Chri&s;tians. True knowledge and learning will &s;carcely try to mend it; they will more pro|bably di&s;cover its total fal&s;ehood, and explode it. And when we con&s;ider, that it &s;trenuou&s;ly
<PB N="48" REF="50">
inculcates the fir&s;t principle of true religion, One God; that it in &s;ome mea&s;ure owns the the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mo&s;es, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the original in&s;piration of our &s;criptures; and that the &s;lendere&s;t acquaintance with hi|&s;tory and critici&s;m will demon&s;trate the impo&s;&s;i|bility of their being fal&s;i&s;ied, as well as the ab|&s;urdity of its own fictions: On the&s;e grounds, without prying into the &s;en&s;e of prophecies yet wrapt up in ob&s;curity, is it pre&s;umptuous to indulge the hope, that this fal&s;e religion will in time pave the way for the general reception of Chri&s;tianity by its numerous profe&s;&s;ors, and that its having been permitted to over&s;pread &s;o large a proportion of mankind, will in the end contribute to the bringing in of <Q>the fulne&s;s of the gentiles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 25&punc;</NOTE>,</Q> and to all <Q>the king|doms of the world becoming the kingdom of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 15.</NOTE>?</Q></P>

<PB N="49" REF="51">
proce&s;s, every &s;eries requires a certain &s;pace of time for the completion of its cour&s;e. It can|not be expected that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e in religion: its motion, towards either corrup|tion or improvement, mu&s;t be &s;ometimes pro|gre&s;&s;ive, &s;ometimes interrupted, and &s;ometimes retrograde; &s;ometimes accelerated, and &s;ome|times checked or retarded, by a variety of cau&s;es: and it is only by tracing it through a large period, that we can determine its i&s;&s;ue. But with the&s;e re&s;trictions, nece&s;&s;ary to be ad|mitted in judging of every ca&s;e, it has, I think, been &s;ufficiently evinced, that true reli|gions are made wor&s;e, and fal&s;e religions bet|ter, in a con&s;iderable length of time.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET us next point out the conclu&s;ions fairly deducible from the facts which we have e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THAT all the corruptions which have been introduced into Chri&s;tianity, cannot warrant the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of its truth, is a con&s;equence &s;o clear and obvious, that it needs no illu&s;tra|tion. If the Jew attempts by them to vindicate his rejection of the go&s;pel, he mu&s;t admit that
<PB N="50" REF="52">
his own religion never came from God; for he cannot deny that it too has been at times cor|rupted. The dei&s;t cannot urge the objection without exploding natural religion; for it de|generated into pagani&s;m: If it be true, though God, far from pre&s;erving its purity, permitted this &s;hameful degeneracy to over&s;pread the world, why may not Chri&s;tianity be al&s;o true, notwith&s;tanding the like &s;eeming neglect of pro|vidence? Had the objection any force, it would nece&s;&s;arily infer that there never was a true re|ligion in the world, and that athei&s;m is the on|ly tenable and con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme.</P>
<P>But from our detail of the fates of differ|ent religions, we venture farther to conclude, that the very fact objected, Chri&s;tianity having been corrupted, yields &s;ome real pre&s;umption of its truth. It is one feature which it has in common with all religions that have any claim to truth, and by which it differs from all reli|gions indi&s;putably fal&s;e. This &s;ingle feature is not &s;ufficient for ab&s;olutely a&s;certaining, but it &s;urely gives &s;ome indication, to which of the two families it belongs.</P>
<P>The indication, however &s;lender when we attend to the mere fact, will become &s;tronger
<PB N="51" REF="53">
and more unequivocal when we examine the rea&s;ons of the fact. For we &s;hall find that the contrariety of the fates of true and of fal&s;e re|ligions, ari&s;es from the very nature of the thing.&mdash;True religions are the work of God, all who&s;e plans, proceeding from his infinite perfection, mu&s;t be pure and complete. It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible that they can be improved by the wi&s;dom of man. But the weakne&s;s of his rea|&s;on, and the power of his pa&s;&s;ions, &s;carcely &s;uf|fer him to adhere to them, preci&s;ely as God gave them. Every deviation from them mu&s;t be to the wor&s;e; and it mu&s;t, by bia&s;&s;ing rea|&s;on and increa&s;ing the impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, contribute to farther deviations; till they &s;ink into the greate&s;t degree of corruption which the vitiated faculties of their votaries can bear.&mdash;But fal&s;e religions are the contrivances of men; and therefore, partaking in the errors and depravations of tho&s;e narrow and polluted conceptions from which they &s;pring, they mu&s;t be always capable of amendment. Every al|teration of men's &s;entiments and views, though not implying con&s;iderable improvement, will di&s;cover &s;ome blemi&s;h which they find it need|ful to remove from their religion. In propor|tion
<PB N="52" REF="54">
as their under&s;tandings are improved, cul|tivated, and enlightened, they will advance to an ampler detection of its ab&s;urdities, and en|deavour to correct them by progre&s;&s;ive refine|ments; till at length the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of all their efforts determine them to abandon it. Ar|rived at the point of its extreme degeneracy, every fal&s;e religion de&s;troys it&s;elf.&mdash;If it be thus&punc; in the nature of the thing, inevitable that true religions are gradually corrupted into &s;uch as may be denominated fal&s;e, and that the&s;e, after having been for &s;ome time &s;tagnant, throw off their dregs and refine them&s;elves, is it not a real pre&s;umption of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, that it has had the&s;e revolutions?</P>
<P>If the&s;e conclu&s;ions be, as they appear to me, legitimate, the argument which I have &s;tated will make &s;ome addition to the proofs of the truth and divinity of our holy religion. Slen|der as it may be, taken by it&s;elf, it is not un|de&s;erving of our regard: for the more nume|rous the proofs, e&s;pecially when they are educed from circum&s;tances untoward and unfavourable, the more irre&s;i&s;tibly they compel our a&s;&s;ent, and &s;ix us in tranquil reliance, in &s;pite of &s;ub|tile
<PB N="53" REF="55">
cavils, on <Q>the certainty of tho&s;e things wherein we have been in&s;tructed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 4.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT though our conclu&s;ions &s;hould, in the judgment of &s;ome, have little force, no harm can, and &s;ome good may, ari&s;e from their hav|ing been propo&s;ed. For all the great evidences of Chri&s;tianity continue unimpaired: and the facts in the hi&s;tory of religion, which have fal|len under our notice, may, without our con&s;i|dering them as inferring the truth of Chri&s;tia|nity, lead us into reflections far from u&s;ele&s;s; a few of which I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>In the whole hi&s;tory of religion, we cannot fail to ob&s;erve, that all the corruptions of it have proceeded from the ignorance and the evil pa&s;&s;ions of men; and that every emendation of it has been produced by the diffu&s;ion of knowledge, partly in con&s;equence of the di&s;co|veries of rea&s;on, but principally owing to the &s;uperior light of divine revelation. The ob&s;er|vation implies at once a &s;trong recommendation of learning and &s;cience, and a convincing proof of the great utility and importance of re|velation.
<PB N="54" REF="56">
And will it not warrant us in &s;aying, that, &s;ince rea&s;on by it&s;elf was able to do &s;ome|thing in religion, much may be expected from the free and &s;ober exerci&s;e of it, illuminated and guided by revelation, and acting in &s;ubor|dination to it?</P>
<P>Zealous have been the efforts of &s;ome, to bani&s;h Chri&s;tianity from the world. Suppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould &s;ucceed, what advan|tage would they gain? Say &s;ome, the extirpa|tion of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> a name which they choo&s;e to give to all <HI>religion:</HI> But, not to inquire whe|ther this would be truly an advantage, the project is impracticable; for the con&s;titution of man, and the whole hi&s;tory of mankind, con|&s;pire to prove that univer&s;al athei&s;m never can take place, and that human creatures will put up with the wor&s;t form of religion, rather than have none. Others promi&s;e a happier con&s;equence, the introduction of natural religion in perfect purity. A &s;y&s;tem of it, I &s;hall not di&s;pute but they might compo&s;e; though it is only by the help of that revelation to which they return &s;o little gratitude, for the wi&s;e&s;t of the ancients never could accompli&s;h it: But by what means are they to qualify the bulk of mankind for en|tering
<PB N="55" REF="57">
into all their rea&s;onings? Or by what art will they induce them, without this, impli|citly to adopt their conclu&s;ions? Suppo&s;e it, however, introduced and univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;till it could be only for a moment. The ex|perience of pa&s;t times demon&s;trates that it would quickly degenerate into polythei&s;m and idolatry: though the acknowledgement of the One God was, in the primeval religion, forti|fied by a memorial of all other things being created by him, it did not long re&s;train them from wor&s;hipping the&s;e as gods; and from this wor&s;hip, the thei&s;m of the be&s;t philo&s;ophers was not able to recover them. The nature of the thing corroborates the illation from expe|rience: Rea&s;on, it is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by one of the acute&s;t in&s;idels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, ib. &sect; 2.</NOTE>, can e&s;tabli&s;h the be|lief of one God, only by careful attention to the &s;ignatures of his power and wi&s;dom in the works of nature; but the opinion of many gods ari&s;es from the pa&s;&s;ions naturally excited by feeling the effects of invi&s;ible power in the varied and contrary events of human life: the latter are always more obvious, and more in|tere&s;ting
<PB N="56" REF="58">
than the former; and con&s;equently mu&s;t create a continual propen&s;ity to polythei&s;m, which rea&s;on alone will be unable to curb. A project, therefore, to explode revelation, is in fact a project to bring the world back to the wor&s;hip of &s;tocks and &s;tones: and whether it betrays greater narrowne&s;s of under&s;tanding, or defect of benevolence, it is not ea&s;y to deter|mine.</P>
<P>From the detail of facts which we have giv|en, it is plain that religion, in the hand of weak and fallible men, is always in danger of being corrupted. A reformation from the cor|ruption which it had once contracted, affords no &s;ecurity again&s;t its being again contaminated. No &s;ooner almo&s;t was Judai&s;m purged from idolatry, than it degenerated anew by a mix|ture of infidelity, my&s;tici&s;m, and &s;uper&s;tition. Into the prote&s;tant religion, with which we are mo&s;t nearly concerned, con&s;iderable ble|mi&s;hes have &s;ometimes found their way. Though the reformers began with declaring &s;cripture to be the only rule of faith, teaching what they thought agreeable to it, and calling upon all men to exerci&s;e their own judgment; yet to this fundamental principle of the reformation
<PB N="57" REF="59">
neither they nor their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have uniform|ly adhered. They were upbraided, by the po|pi&s;h writers, with the uncertainty of their doc|trine, and importuned for a preci&s;e expo&s;ition of their faith: they yielded to the clamour, and reduced their theology into formal &s;y&s;tems. At fir&s;t they propo&s;ed them only as an an&s;wer to the demands of their opponents: but they quickly erected them into &s;tandards of faith, and exacted a &s;trict conformity to them as a condition of communion. They con&s;i&s;ted not of a &s;eries of propo&s;itions clearly revealed in &s;crip|ture: but too often included definitions re&s;trict|ing its words to the one &s;en&s;e which they approved, far fetched and di&s;putable deductions from it, &s;ubtile explications of its &s;imple prin|ciples, and precarious hypothe&s;es for &s;upporting them. The diver&s;ity of the&s;e human &s;y&s;tems occa&s;ioned controver&s;ies; the authority a&s;cribed to each of them inflamed the &s;pirit of conten|tion; the &s;iercene&s;s of contention produced &s;chi&s;ms: and both attachment to a particular party, and abhorrence of it, bia&s;&s;ed the minds of men from impartiality in &s;earching the &s;crip|tures. In the colli&s;ion of &s;ects and parties, &s;ome, from exce&s;&s;ive deference to human au|thority,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
reverted nearer to the degenerate church which they had for&s;aken; &s;ome affected too much a contrariety in every point; &s;ome con&s;e|crated dogmas evidently un&s;criptural; &s;ome ex|plained away tenets really founded in the bible; and many laid greater &s;tre&s;s on the di&s;tinctive notions of a &s;ect, than on active faith in the &s;imple practical principles of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To &s;ome depravation, our religion will be ever liable by rea&s;on of the infirmities of its pro|fe&s;&s;ors. While they think that they are maintain|ing it in its purity, they may be only holding fa&s;t &s;ome error from which it has not hitherto been wholly purged. While they mean only to ca&s;t off the remains of error, they may be in|troducing new errors. Our duty is, to employ the be&s;t precautions for e&s;caping from the dan|ger to which we cannot cea&s;e to be expo&s;ed. However much Chri&s;tianity may be at times depraved, it always carries along with it the means of its re&s;toration.

<P>I MAKE no digre&s;&s;ion from the &s;ubject on which I have all along in&s;i&s;ted, when I now turn my di&s;cour&s;e to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the meeting of the Society in Scotland for propa|gating Chri&s;tian Knowledge. The very object of its in&s;titution is, at once to bring tho&s;e to the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity, who before had no opportunity of learning it; and to impart it in greater purity to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the mo&s;t adulterated form of it. This noble ob|ject, the plan of the Society leads them to pur|&s;ue by the only legitimate and proper means, in&s;truction. They have wi&s;ely directed their fir&s;t endeavours to what promi&s;es the be&s;t ef|fects, in&s;tilling religious principles and good
<PB N="61" REF="63">
habits into the &s;u&s;ceptible minds of the young: but they have not neglected what they had it in their power to do, for recovering tho&s;e who had long been en&s;laved by error and &s;uper&s;tition. By procuring tran&s;lations of the &s;acred books, into the only language generally under&s;tood in many corners of the kingdom, they have given to multitudes an opportunity of drawing reli|gious knowledge from the unpolluted fountains of truth, and of continually improving in it by their own application. They have extended their views to the propagation of the go&s;pel, by the like proper means, in remote regions of the earth, wherever the vicinity of fellow-pro|te&s;tants gave any favourable opening. It is by &s;uch means only, that true religion has ever been &s;pread, or corruptions of it effectually re|moved: it is by &s;uch means only, that the&s;e events can in any ca&s;e be rea&s;onably expected. God forbid that they who wi&s;h, or who exert them&s;elves, for the prevalence of true religion, &s;hould at any time &s;o far mi&s;take their way, as to approve or aid a re&s;traint on the profe&s;&s;ion of of the fal&s;e&s;t, by the terror of civil laws, or the &s;mart of penalties. Nothing could more ob|&s;truct the accompli&s;hment of their wi&s;h or the
<PB N="62" REF="64">
efficacy of their exertions. Such engines may impo&s;e &s;ilence or force a feigned compliance: but they often irritate to &s;tiffer oppo&s;ition; and they never can produce conviction or conver|tion. No, Chri&s;tians: <Q>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal;</Q> their temper is from heaven: and if we do not hurt it by the ba&s;e alloy of human policy, they will be <Q>migh|ty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong holds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> When the good ends are an|&s;wered, for which the in&s;crutable providence of God has permitted <Q>the man of &s;in to exalt him&s;elf, the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume him by the &s;pirit and words of his mouth <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. ii. 8.

<P>On the manner in which the Society have employed the legitimate means of promoting the knowledge of the go&s;pel, it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to expatiate. Of the uniform integrity of their intentions, the regular publications of their proceedings, &s;tating the &s;imple facts, mark|ing

the mi&s;carriages as well as the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their plans, evidence the fulle&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in them&s;elves, and give others the faire&s;t opportuni|ty of judging. On the prudence and rectitude of their management, the continual and growing encouragement with which they meet, is the be&s;t encomium. The pious per&s;ons who plan|ned the in&s;titution &s;aw <Q>multitudes fainting and &s;cattered abroad&punc; as &s;heep having no &s;hepherd;</Q> and in the &s;pirit of their divine ma&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 36, 37, 38.</NOTE>, they were <Q>moved with compa&s;&s;ion on them.

The funds which they could command for this purpo&s;e, bore no proportion to the greatne&s;s of the de|&s;ign: and from the nature and &s;ituation of the country, from the rude &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners, from prejudices both political and religious, numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions aro&s;e in the execution of it.

<P>IT is with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction that the Directors have it in their power to begin the &s;tatement of their pro|ceedings for the pre&s;ent year, with the account of an acce&s;&s;ion to the funds of the Society, &s;ince the la&s;t publication, equally large and unexpected, ari&s;ing from two different &s;ources.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was announced to the Directors in April la&s;t. For &s;ome time before, a corre&s;pondence had been carried on between a re&s;pectable clergyman in the neighbouring part of the kingdom and the Secretary of the Society, re&s;pecting the nature of the in&s;titution, the &s;tate of the Society's funds, and the objects to which they are devoted. Inquiries on the&s;e points, it &s;eems, were made at the reque&s;t of a gentleman, who then had it in view to become a benefactor to the So|ciety, but who wi&s;hed previou&s;ly to &s;atisfy him&s;elf as
<PB N="68" REF="70">
to the pro&s;pect of utility to the public from his intend|ed donation. The information wanted, was immedi|ately given, in the fulle&s;t and free&s;t manner; and, as the Secretary was a&s;&s;ured by his reverend corre&s;pon|dent, to the entire &s;atisfaction of the gentleman at who&s;e de&s;ire the corre&s;pondence was carried on. The hopes of the members were in con&s;equence excited of a con&s;iderable donation; but their mo&s;t &s;anguine ideas were far exceeded by the munificent gift of which they &s;oon after received the notice: For in a letter from the &s;ame clergyman, towards the end of March, a tru&s;t|deed was tran&s;mitted to the Secretary, conveying to the Society the &s;um of TEN THOUSAND POUNDS &s;tock in the national fund of the five <HI>per cent.</HI> annuities. The &s;tock was transferred to a mo&s;t re&s;pectable gentle|man as tru&s;tee, to receive the dividends on the So|ciety's account for a few years, if they &s;hould think it proper that the tru&s;t &s;hould continue &s;o long; but with power to them to take the &s;tock into their own management, in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;o incline. This dona|tion, &s;o con&s;iderable and unexpected, was rendered &s;till more remarkable by the &s;ingular delicacy of the gene|rous donor's mind. While he took effectual mea&s;ures that the benefit of his donation &s;hould be enjoyed by the public, he di&s;covered an equal and no le&s;s effectual anxiety, that the benefactor &s;hould remain altogether unknown. The Society are therefore prevented from communicating per&s;onally to him&s;elf the &s;entiments of gratitude and re&s;pect with which this princely bene|faction has impre&s;&s;ed their minds. The&s;e however, they anxiou&s;ly embraced the earlie&s;t opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing to the clergyman through who&s;e channel
<PB N="69" REF="71">
this corre&s;pondence had been conducted, and to the gentleman who had been nominated, and had con|&s;ented to act as tru&s;tee. By them the grateful impre&s;|&s;ions of the Society were communicated to this ge|nerous, though unknown, friend to religion and the country. As a &s;mall te&s;timony of their gratitude (the only one in their power), the Society unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, and immediately <HI>a&s;&s;umed as members</HI> both the gentleman who is appointed tru&s;tee, and the cler|gyman above referred to.</P>
<P>Soon after the intelligence of this large and uncom|mon donation had been given, the Society had the &s;atisfaction to receive accounts of a &s;econd acce&s;&s;ion to their funds, &s;till more con&s;iderable than the former, by a legacy of the late <HI>Peter Huguetan, Lord Vanvry hovven of Holland.</HI> For &s;ome years, this Nobleman had been a regular and liberal benefactor to the in&s;titution, at the anniver&s;ary meetings of the Corre&s;ponding Board in London; and in 1789, the Society received from him a donation of five hundred pounds of the four <HI>per cent.</HI> Bank annuities, tran&s;ferred to them by a deed of tru&s;t. After his death, which happened in the cour&s;e of this year, it appeared, that by his will, he had, among&s;t a variety of other legacies to different charitable in&s;titutions, to a very large amount, be|queathed to the Society in Scotland for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge, the &s;um of TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS, for the purpo&s;es of the fir&s;t and &s;econd pa|tents; that is to &s;ay, for promoting religion, litera|ture, and indu&s;try in the Highlands and I&s;lands. His Lord&s;hip's executors have found it nece&s;&s;ary, before paying any of the legacies, to have the authority of
<PB N="70" REF="72">
the Court of Chancery for their procedure. This may occa&s;ion &s;ome little delay in the payment of the lega|cy; but there is no doubt, that in a &s;hort time the Society will be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this great and mu|nificent beque&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two large additions to their funds, the Society likewi&s;e, with gratitude, have to acknowledge many le&s;&s;er benefactions, which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to particulari&s;e: One only it may be proper to mention&punc;&mdash;a legacy of three hundred pounds, bequeathed by the late Mrs. Wel&s;h of Edinburgh, which they lately re|ceived.</P>
<P>The&s;e numerous and &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of the favour of the public to this in&s;titution, the Society regard as a circum&s;tance no le&s;s honourable than plea&s;ing. To employ the&s;e large additions to their revenue, in the manner mo&s;t con&s;onant to the views of the donors, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of religion and the country, is their duty, and &s;hall be their con&s;tant endeavour.</P>
<P>The anniver&s;ary meeting of the Corre&s;ponding Board at London for this year, was no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful than on former occa&s;ions. The &s;ermon was preached by the Reverend Mr. Rutledge, one of the members of the Church of Scotland&punc; &s;ettled in London. Though the interference of an important debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons on the day of meeting, prevented almo&s;t all the members of both Hou&s;es of Parliament from being pre&s;ent; though their noble Pre&s;es, the Earl of Kin|noul (who&s;e zeal for the Society's welfare they have on every occa&s;ion experienced), was detained by bad health, and three of the &s;tewards, by nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;i|ne&s;s; yet upwards of one hundred and &s;ixty noblemen
<PB N="71" REF="73">
and gentlemen attended the meeting, the Earl of Gla&s;|gow being in the chair. The collection amounted to upwards of two hundred and &s;ixty pounds. The par|ticular thanks of the Society are due to the Earl of Gla&s;gow, the Reverend Mr. Rutledge, the Reverend Dr. Hunter, the &s;everal noblemen and gentlemen who exe|cuted the office of &s;tewards at the meeting, and the mem|bers of the Corre&s;ponding Board, for their &s;ervices on this, as well as on many former occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The lea&s;e of the Society's e&s;tate of Calrou&s;t being near a clo&s;e, the Directors thought it their duty, in order to a&s;certain the real value of this farm, to adver|ti&s;e a new lea&s;e of it, publicly intimating, that the pro|po&s;als, which upon the whole &s;hould appear to be the be&s;t, &s;hould be preferred. Propo&s;als were made by different candidates, offering con&s;iderable additions of rent: After con&s;idering which, a lea&s;e was lately entered into with the former tenant, at a rent more than double of what the&s;e lands had formerly yielded. A bargain which, however advantageous to the So|ciety, they have rea&s;on to believe, will prove by no means oppre&s;&s;ive to the tenant.</P>
<P>The lea&s;e of the Society's e&s;tate of Catworth in Huntingdon&s;hire, expired at Whit&s;unday 1790. Be|fore renewing it, the Directors procured an accurate report by a gentleman on the &s;pot, of its &s;tate and va|lue: And &s;oon afterwards, the Earl of Kinnoul, with his u&s;ual attention to the intere&s;ts of the Society, &s;ub|mitted to the trouble of a minute inve&s;tigation of that report; by which it was confirmed in all particu|lars: And his Lord&s;hip, in con&s;equence of powers from the Directors, concluded a new lea&s;e with the
<PB N="72" REF="74">
former tenant, at a rent higher by twenty pounds than the former.</P>
<P>The revenue ari&s;ing from this la&s;t mentioned e&s;tate, together with that of &s;ome other branches of the Society's funds, are by the donors &s;pecially appro|priated to the propagation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge in America, and other heathen and infidel countries. The Society have not been inattentive to the proper applica|tion of the&s;e funds. Two mi&s;&s;ionaries, as has been formerly mentioned to the public, are employed by them in America, viz. the Reverend Mr. Kirkland a|mong the Oneida, Onondago, and Seneka Indians, and the Reverend Mr. Sargeant among the Stockbridge tribes. Of the ardent zeal and indefatigable exertions of the former, the Society have repeatedly had occa&s;ion to report in the warme&s;t terms of approbation. His la&s;t journals afford &s;ufficient evidence that his labours are continued with uniform earne&s;tne&s;s and per&s;ever|ance. The labours of Mr. Sargeant, though in a narrower &s;phere, appear to be faithful and a&s;&s;iduous&punc; What &s;ucce&s;s may ultimately attend the exertions of the Society in the&s;e remote and unenlightened regions, it is not for the members to pronounce. That many individuals among the Savages have, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, become &s;avingly acquainted with the truths of the Go&s;pel, and that the morals and external conduct of great numbers have been improved, they have &s;uf|ficient ground to believe. One thing is acknowledged by all who have acce&s;s to be acquainted with the&s;e tribes, that tho&s;e of them among whom the light of the Go&s;pel has been in any mea&s;ure diffu&s;ed, have be|come
<PB N="73" REF="75">
le&s;s addicted to exce&s;s in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors, le&s;s cruel and ferocious in their manners, and more attentive to the arts of civilized life, particularly agriculture. Of late, propo&s;als have been laid before the Society for &s;ome farther exten&s;ion of their exer|tions, by e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;chools in the Indian terri|tories, for educating in the principles of Chri&s;tiani|ty, literature, and civilization, the children of the Indians, particularly tho&s;e of the Sachems or chief men; and al&s;o for &s;ending a new mi&s;&s;ion into the remote, and hitherto almo&s;t unexplored country of the Cherokees. Tho&s;e propo&s;als appeared to them to merit attention: The fir&s;t of them, for erecting &s;ome new &s;chools for the education of In|dian youth, they have already taken mea&s;ures for adopting; the other is a matter of &s;uch difficulty, and attended with &s;uch expence, that far more information mu&s;t be obtained, as to the method of carrying it into execution, and its probable &s;ucce&s;s, before the Direc|tors will think them&s;elves vindicated in making the attempt. A plan formerly under con&s;ideration, for conveying the knowledge of the Go&s;pel to Africa, by means of &s;ome emancipated and converted negroes of Rhode I&s;land, has again been renewed; and the Di|rectors have written to the re&s;pectable clergyman with whom the propo&s;al originated, for &s;uch information as may enable them to judge of its practicability.</P>
<P>The concluding part of the tran&s;lation of the Gaelic Bible is now in the pre&s;s, and part of it printed off. From the nature of the work, and the uncommon at|tention it requires, the progre&s;s is nece&s;&s;arily &s;low; but the public may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that no care &s;hall be
<PB N="74" REF="76">
wanting, to carry it on with as little delay as circum|&s;tances will allow.</P>
<P>In the Apendix to la&s;t anniver&s;ary &s;ermon, the Di|rectors &s;tated their proceedings in regard to the execu|tion of the will of the late pious Lady Glenorchy, and the funds de&s;tined for the improvement of the e&s;tates of Breadalbane and Sutherland. To what is there de|tailed in relation to the fir&s;t of the&s;e e&s;tates, the Di|rectors have nothing to add, but that the continuance of the co-operation and encouragement of the noble proprietor and his men of bu&s;ine&s;s, gives the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of much &s;atisfaction to the Society, as well as benefit to the country, from this well-directed legacy. In regard to that part of it, intended for the e&s;tate of Sutherland, it was then mentioned that a plan for the di&s;po&s;al of it had been formed, after much enquiry and corre&s;pondence on the &s;ubject, and tran&s;mitted to the noble proprietors for their con&s;ent and co-opera|tion. The &s;tipulations required by the Society were &s;o moderate, and &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e chearfully agreed to by many other proprietors in the Highlands, that the Directors would not allow them&s;elves to doubt of a ready compliance on the&punc; part of tho&s;e of the e&s;tate of Sutherland. It is with deep regret that they find them&s;elves obliged to acknowledge that their hopes had been too &s;anguine. The Directors are unwilling to enter into a detail of the corre&s;pondence which took place between the noble proprietors and them on the &s;ubject. Suffice it to &s;ay, that upon find|ing, after repeated endeavours, that they could not ob|tain for the teachers, male and female, whom they pro|po&s;ed to appoint in that country, the accommodations
<PB N="75" REF="77">
nece&s;&s;ary, and u&s;ually granted&punc; they were reluctantly compelled to take advantage of that clau&s;e in Lady Glenorchy's will, by which, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al of co|operation upon the part of the proprietors of either e|&s;tate, the Directors &s;hould be at liberty to be&s;tow the money in any part of the Highlands or i&s;lands where they &s;hould think proper. It is but ju&s;tice however, to Earl Gower to &s;tate, that altho' he did not choo&s;e to agree to the terms of the Directors, they were a&s;&s;ured by his de&s;ire, that he had given orders to his agent to allow annually for charitable purpo&s;es upon the e&s;tate, a &s;um equal to that, which, from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the fund, would have ari&s;en from Lady Glenorchy's legacy. The Directors have only to add, upon this &s;ubject, which of all their communications to the public concerning their proceedings is the lea&s;t gratifying to their own feelings, that upon receiving the la&s;t an&s;wer from the noble proprietors, which precluded all hopes of a &s;peedy renewal of the corre&s;pondence with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they came to the following re&s;olution; with which they &s;hall leave the &s;ubject, and their own con|duct, to the deci&s;ion of an impartial public. <Q>The Directors having read, and maturely con&s;idered, the whole of the corre&s;pondence which has taken place between the Counte&s;s of Sutherland, in name of her|&s;elf and Lord Gower, upon the one part, and the &s;e|cretary of the Society, under the &s;anction of the au|thority of the committee on the other: Find, That, the proprietors of the e&s;tate of Sutherland, have de|clined to co-operate with the Directors in their plan for the improvement of the inhabitants of that e|&s;tate in religion and indu&s;try: And that in con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
the Directors are, by the terms of Lady Glenorchy's will, prevented from laying out the money which &s;he intended for that e&s;tate, in the manner which appeared to them be&s;t adapted to pro|mote the object, which the pious te&s;tatrix had in view: That they are therefore at liberty to be&s;tow that money in promoting the general objects of the Society in any part of the Highlands and i&s;lands, where it &s;hall appear to them to be nece&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time, the Directors, deeply &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity which the e&s;tate of Sutherland labours un|der of the means of in&s;truction, both with re&s;pect to literature and indu&s;try, and feeling &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion for the people, RESOLVE, That whenever any appli|cation &s;hall be made from any part of that country for aid from the funds of the Society, and proper &s;ecurity given for the fulfilment of the conditions re|quired by its fundamental rules, they will gladly li&s;ten to &s;uch application.</Q></P>
<P>It only remains, that in this ab&s;tract of their pro|ceedings &s;ince the la&s;t publication, the Directors &s;hould &s;tate the progre&s;s of the Secretary in the execution of the commi&s;&s;ion granted him in the year 1789; the par|ticular objects of which were recited in the Appendix of that year.</P>
<P>Having employed the greate&s;t part of two Summers preceding, in vi&s;iting very different and exten&s;ive di&s;|tricts of the Highlands and i&s;lands, the Secretary flat|tered him&s;elf, that he &s;hould have been able, during the cour&s;e of this la&s;t, to have fulfilled all that he originally propo&s;ed in the di&s;charge of his commi&s;&s;ion. And had his attention been con&s;ined to the mere <HI>vi&s;ita|tion</HI> of the &s;chools already upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the
<PB N="77" REF="79">
Society, it is probable that he might have accompli&s;h|ed this object. But in con&s;equence of the late very great acce&s;&s;ion to their funds, which has been already &s;tated, the Society were led to enlarge their ideas and their plans to a &s;cale corre&s;ponding with their ex|tended capacities of u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The remote we&s;tern Highlands and i&s;lands, of all the countries of Scotland, were the lea&s;t known to the So|ciety, and, of all tho&s;e to which their attention is called by their patents, had lea&s;t experienced the benefit of their in&s;titution. It was re&s;olved that the Secretary &s;hould vi|&s;it the&s;e di&s;tant and widely extended di&s;tricts, enquire into the &s;tate of religion, literature, and indu&s;try a|mong their inhabitants, and report to the Society &s;uch plans as &s;hould appear mo&s;t likely to promote their improvement. A general outline of a tour for this purpo&s;e was agreed upon by the Directors in concert with the Secretary; and he was in&s;tructed to begin his journey as &s;oon after the anniver&s;ary meeting in June as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On account of the extent, variety, and difficulty of the navigation which this tour involved, it was judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be provided or obtained to attend him, during the cour&s;e of it. To have hired one of a competent &s;ize, would have been attended with great expence: be&s;ides that, &s;carcely any one could have been got for hire &s;o well adapted to the purpo&s;e, as one of the revenue cutters in the &s;ervice of Government.</P>
<P>From the well known liberality of the Board of Cu&s;|toms, in promoting all objects of public utility, and from the private information of one of its re&s;pectable members, the Society were led to hope, that an appli|cation
<PB N="78" REF="80">
to them for one of the yachts under their imme|diate direction, would not fail of &s;ucce&s;s. The Pre&s;i|dent having accordingly applied in name of the Society to the Board, a mo&s;t polite an&s;wer was received; and the <HI>Prince of Wales</HI> brig, commanded by Captain John Campbell, was ordered to be in readine&s;s at Oban by the 15th of June, to take on board the Secretary, and proceed with him during the whole of his tour. And here the Directors think it nothing more than ju&s;|tice to mention, that in this ve&s;&s;el the Secretary &s;ound mo&s;t excellent accomodation; a careful obliging com|mander, &s;ober, attentive, and diligent officers and &s;ea|men: of all of whom, every one was more ready than another to oblige him, and to forward the objects of his mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Secretary having &s;et out from Edinburgh in the middle of June, proceeded by the way of Gla&s;gow, Dumbarton, and Inverary, to Oban; vi&s;iting &s;uch of the Society's &s;chools as lay immediately on his road, but not diverted by any that lay remote from it, from the great objects of this Summer's tour, viz. the di&s;|tant we&s;tern coa&s;ts and remoter i&s;lands of the He|brides.</P>
<P>Having gone aboard the yacht at Oban, he proceeded through the &s;ound of Mull to Tobermory, one of the newly e&s;tabli&s;hed villages of the Briti&s;h Society, where their operations are going on with &s;pirit, and already make a re&s;pectable appearance; vi&s;ited the we&s;tern parts of the i&s;land of Mull, where he had not been during the cour&s;e of his former tour; &s;ailed up Loch Sunart, an arm of the &s;ea, &s;tretching 35 miles into the main|land on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, to Strontian, a &s;tation where
<PB N="79" REF="81">
the Society have long had a &s;chool e&s;tabli&s;hed; went round the point of Ardnamurchan, a promontory &s;tretching far into the we&s;tern ocean, beat by an almo&s;t continually turbulent &s;ea; and &s;ailed along the coa&s;ts of Moydart, Ari&s;aig, and Morer, inhabited chiefly by Roman Catholics, though now, in con&s;equence of the progre&s;s of &s;heep-farming, their numbers are greatly dimini&s;hed by emigration.</P>
<P>On this exten&s;ive coa&s;t the Society have only one &s;chool e&s;tabli&s;hed, and even that is in a langui&s;hing &s;tate. He proceeded to the i&s;land of Egg, the chief of four &s;mall i&s;les, of which the pari&s;h of that name con&s;i&s;ts; and, accompanied by the mini&s;ter, &s;ailed to a harbour in Slate, the &s;outhermo&s;t pari&s;h of the va&s;t i&s;land of Sky; having traver&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of that pari&s;h, he cro&s;&s;ed over to the coa&s;t of <HI>Knoi|dart,</HI> and vi&s;ited a &s;chool of the Society there: Pro|ceeded to <HI>Glenelg,</HI> where he had the plea&s;ure to meet the &s;ynod of the bounds, though, on account of the &s;ingular violence and long continuance of a &s;torm at the time, few, comparatively, of the clergy had been able to a&s;&s;emble. From them who did meet in the &s;ynod, both collectively and individually, he experi|enced much attention, and received much information. From Glenelg, accompanied by &s;ome of the mini&s;ters, the Secretary travelled, &s;ometimes by water, and &s;ome|times on hor&s;eback or on foot, through the pari&s;hes of Kintail, Lochal&s;h, Lochcarron, and Applecro&s;s. From thence to the i&s;lands of Scalpa and Raa&s;a;&mdash;back to Sky; traver&s;ed Diurni&s;h, Braccadale, Snizort, Kil|muir and Portree, exten&s;ive pari&s;hes in that great i&s;land;&mdash;a part of his tour which, from the badne&s;s of
<PB N="80" REF="82">
the greater part of the roads, and the almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant rain of that watery climate, was attended with no &s;mall fatigue.</P>
<P>From Sky he &s;ailed to Lochbroom; vi&s;ited &s;everal &s;chools of the Society in that country; and among the re&s;t, one e&s;tabli&s;hed at Ullapool, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fa|voured &s;ettlement of the Briti&s;h Society; and where, in con&s;equence of the reque&s;t of that Society, the Di|rectors have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who is at the &s;ame time an ordained mini&s;ter, and officiates every Sunday to a numerous congregation, by whom his u&s;e|fulne&s;s is felt and acknowledged.</P>
<P>From Ullapool the Secretary &s;ailed to Stornoway, a populous and thriving village in the i&s;land of Lewis, the property of Humber&s;ton M'Kenzie of Seaforth, E&s;q. There, in concert with the proprietor, (who di&s;|covered a mo&s;t laudable zeal for the object), the mini|&s;ters of the four exten&s;ive pari&s;hes into which this great i&s;land is divided, together with &s;ome intelligent and re&s;pectable people of Stornoway, &s;ome plans were devi&s;ed for promoting the much needed improvement of the inhabitants, in religion, literature, and indu&s;try, and put into a fair train for being carried into execu|tion.</P>
<P>From Stornoway he &s;ailed by the coa&s;t of Harris, to North Ui&s;t, and, accompanied by the mini&s;ters of Harris, North Ui&s;t, and Barra, travelled on hor&s;eback through North Ui&s;t, and over the &s;trands at low water, to Benbicula and South Ui&s;t; cro&s;&s;ed over to Barra; &s;ailed to the i&s;lands of Cana, Rum, Col, Tiree; and returning by the Sound of Mull, and pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;lands adjoining to the coa&s;t of Argyle&s;hire, which he had
<PB N="81" REF="83">
vi&s;ited on a former tour, went to tho&s;e of Jura and I&s;la; in the la&s;t mentioned of which, the exertions and &s;ucce&s;s of that indefatigable and &s;agacious improver, Mr. Campbell of Shawfield, affected his mind with equal plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e. From I&s;la he &s;ailed round the Mull of Kintyre to Campbelton, and returned by Ar|ran and Bute to Greenock and Gla&s;gow, after an ab|&s;ence of three months and &s;ome days.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this various and exten&s;ive tour, the Secretary experienced every where from the gentlemen and clergy the greate&s;t per&s;onal attention, and that ho&s;pitality for which they have been always and ju&s;tly celebrated. Among tho&s;e whom, on this account, he mentioned with re&s;pect and gratitude in his journal, are Sir James Riddel of Ardnamurchan and Sunart, Bart., Mr. M`Kenzie of Applecro&s;s, Colo|nel M`Leod of M`Leod, Mr. M`Kenzie of Seaforth, Mr. M`Donald of Boi&s;dale, Mr. M`Lean of Col, and Mr. Campbell of Shawfield, Mr. Maxwell, factor for the Duke of Argyll in Mull, Mr. Campbell, his Grace's chamberlain in the i&s;land of Tirii, and Mr. M`Donald of Liondale in Sky. To all his brethren of the clergy without exception, with whom he had acce&s;s to meet, he acknowledged his obliga|tions for their attention and civilities: The per&s;onal at|tendance and fatigue to which they &s;ubmitted in for|warding his progre&s;s, and the objects of his mi&s;&s;ion, ren|der a particular tribute of thanks due to Mr. M`Iver of Glenelg; Mr. M`Queen of Applecro&s;s; Mr. M`Leod of Harris; and Mr Edmund M`Queen of North Ui&s;t. Nor was he unmindful of what he owed to &s;ome of the clergy of the Roman Catholic per&s;ua&s;ion for their per|&s;onal civilities, and what he &s;till more highly valued,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
the liberality of &s;pirit, and zeal with which they entered into, and forwarded the objects of his mi&s;&s;ion, paricularly by exhorting and u&s;ing their influence with their people to &s;end their children to the &s;chools of the Society, to be in&s;tructed in literature, and in tho&s;e great principles of religion in which all &s;ects among Chri&s;tians are u|nited. It was a &s;ight, he is per&s;uaded, not common&mdash;a Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter, commi&s;&s;ioned by the Society for propogating Chri&s;tian Knowledge, attended in his pro|gre&s;s by Roman Catholic prie&s;ts, and they zealou&s;ly joining with him in common efforts, to promote the reading of the &s;criptures, among the youth of their own community. For his introduction to them, and their favourable impre&s;&s;ions of his views, he ac|knowledged his obligations to the candid and fair re|pre&s;entations of a worthy and re&s;pectable per&s;on among the &s;uperior order of the clergy of that per&s;ua&s;ion in Scotland.&mdash;Names, in this part of the detail, prudence &s;ugge&s;ts, it may be proper to omit.</P>
<P>To &s;everal of the above named great proprietors, the Secretary was indebted, not merely for ho&s;pitality and per&s;onal attentions, but for the zeal with which they entered into the views and the liberality which they ex|exerci&s;ed in promoting the objects of his mi&s;&s;ion, on their exten&s;ive e&s;tates. Among the&s;e, Seaforth, M`Leod, and Shawfield, are to be numbered with particular re|&s;pect. The Duke of Argyll, though his want of health at the time, deprived the Secretary of the honour of waiting upon him in per&s;on; yet, with the wonted, and well known benevolence of his character, furni&s;hed his men of bu&s;ine&s;s with the ample&s;t in&s;tructions to promote the objects of the Secretary's commi&s;&s;ion, in
<PB N="83" REF="85">
the different parts of his immen&s;e e&s;tate;&mdash;in&s;tructions, with which, in the &s;pirit that dictated them, they are &s;tudying to comply.</P>
<P>The Secretary's journal concludes with the following general ob&s;ervations, and propo&s;itions, which were read fir&s;t to the Directors, and then to a general meet|ing of the Society; the Directors judged it expedient to lay them al&s;o before the public at large.</P>
<P>"Thus, the Secretary has endeavoured to fulfil the objects of the commi&s;&s;ion given to him by the Society in the tour marked out for him for the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on. It is by far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and in a variety of re|&s;pects, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, which he has ever under|taken in their &s;ervice. Having kept a regular journal of his proceedings, he thinks it his duty to offer it as it is, in its &s;imple unornamented form, to the candid attention of his con&s;tituents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Being too long to be read to a meeting, it was handed round among the members individually.</NOTE>. It pre&s;ents a melan|choly picture of a va&s;t extent of country, and of the &s;i|tuation of a great multitude of our fellow citizens. He put down, with fidelity, upon the &s;pot, whatever occurred to him to be nece&s;&s;ary to exhibit their real circum&s;tan|ces; and the painful re&s;ult of the whole is, that pover|ty, ignorance, and idlene&s;s, or rather the want of proper and profitable indu&s;try, generally obtain in the remoter we&s;tern coa&s;ts and i&s;lands; in &s;ome exten&s;ive di&s;tricts, he is &s;orry to be obliged to add, neglect, and even op|pre&s;&s;ion. To attempt to remedy prevailing di&s;orders, and to afford &s;ome &s;upply to the defects by which they
<PB N="84" REF="86">
are in great mea&s;ure occa&s;ioned, is the unque&s;tionable duty of the Society.</P>
<P>After peru&s;ing the report which he has given in, the members, he is per&s;uaded, will join with the &s;ecretary, in grateful acknowledgments to a kind Providence, which by the late wonderful acce&s;&s;ion to their funds, has enabled them &s;o far to enlarge their &s;cheme, as to embrace within its benevolent compa&s;s, many parts of the ancient kingdom of Scotland hitherto in great mea|&s;ure neglected. The Secretary has &s;tated, as he went along, the objects in the&s;e parts which mo&s;t imme|diately claim the attention of the Society: the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments for religion, literature, and indu&s;try, which appear to be chiefly wanted: the encouragements which they may expect to meet with, and the ob&s;tacles which may oppo&s;e their beneficent exertions.</P>
<P>The Secretary begs leave to &s;ugge&s;t, by way of con|clu&s;ion to his long narrative, a few general ob&s;erva|tions which appear to be of importance; and then to offer &s;ome hints towards a plan for the di&s;bur&s;ement of the Society's additional funds.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight, one is apt to imagine, that nothing can be more ea&s;y, as nothing to a benevolent mind is &s;o plea|&s;ant, as the di&s;tribution of money for charitable purpo|&s;es. A narrower in&s;pection, however, &s;oon convinces every per&s;on of under&s;tanding, that to &s;elect the proper objects, and to be&s;tow in &s;uch a manner as not to ob|&s;truct but to forward the general progre&s;s and welfare of Society, is a difficult ta&s;k, requiring much inve&s;tiga|tion, and the exerci&s;e of a &s;ound and vigorous mind.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, many ob&s;tacles to the benevo|lent de&s;igns of the Society ari&s;e from the remotene&s;s of
<PB N="85" REF="87">
the countries to which they extend, and the peculiar circum&s;tances in which they are placed: Of the&s;e, per|haps, none can form a &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct or impre&s;&s;ive idea, who has not vi&s;ited them, and had an opportuni|ty of becoming per&s;onally acquainted with the &s;ituations and characters, habits and prejudices, of the different cla&s;&s;es of the inhabitants. Such is the poverty of the great body of them, &s;uch their deficiency of the means of religion, literature, and indu&s;try, that the additional funds of the &s;ociety, ample as they have now become, are by no means equal to the &s;upply of their wants. Some di&s;crimination, therefore, is nece&s;&s;ary. Some general rules and fixed principles mu&s;t be adopt|ed and adhered to, el&s;e di&s;order, neglect of &s;ome mo&s;t de&s;titute &s;ituations, and general complaints of partiality and favouriti&s;m again&s;t the Directors, mu&s;t en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The FIRST principle, therefore, which ought in all ca&s;es to be acted upon, is, <HI>that without co-operation and &s;upport from &s;ome having immediate intere&s;t, the Society ought never to be&s;tow their funds in promoting any objects whatever in the&s;e countries.</HI> But the on|ly cla&s;s of men from whom they can expect effect|ual co-operation, are either the proprietors of e&s;tates, or &s;ub&s;tantial tack&s;men, who can give the &s;ecurity of long lea&s;es for the performance of their covenants.</P>
<P>The body of the people are &s;o poor and di&s;pirited, and hold their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by &s;o in&s;ecure a tenure, that upon them no dependence can be placed.</P>
<P>The experience of the Society for many years, too amply vindicates this a&s;&s;ertion. In a multitude of in&s;tances which have fallen under the ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="86" REF="88">
the Secretary, where the mo&s;t liberal promi&s;es of ac|commodation to their teachers were given, &s;carcely any of them have been fulfilled. The teachers have been forced, out of their &s;mall &s;alaries, to pay for the e&s;&s;ential articles, which, by the rules of the Society and the engagements of the people, &s;hould have been furni&s;hed to them gratis. The con&s;equences are, ex|treme indigence, depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, negligence of duty, and contempt.</P>
<P>Let no urgency of intreaty, therefore, and no cla|mancy of &s;ituation ever induce the Directors to depart from their e&s;tabli&s;hed rules upon this point; and to &s;e|cure the fulfilment of engagements, <HI>let no teacher ever be &s;ent to a &s;tation till the articles conditioned for are actually provided.</HI></P>
<P>This principle may &s;eem har&s;h: It may be &s;aid, that where the people are too poor to be able, and the pro|prietors unwilling to furni&s;h the accommodations re|quired, it is hard that the people &s;hould &s;uffer&mdash;that they are only objects of the greater commi&s;eration. It is confe&s;&s;ed that it is hard, and in many ca&s;es a matter of ju&s;t and deep regret. But, as has been mentioned, general rules <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be adhered to, el&s;e unavoidable con|fu&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue; and be&s;ides, it is certain, that however aver&s;e &s;ome proprietors may be to give en|couragement for cultivating the minds and morals of their people; yet, <HI>as many</HI> will be found willing, as will exhau&s;t the funds which the Society can afford, or are entitled by the will of the donors to be&s;tow, upon the&s;e objects: <HI>and if people who e&s;&s;entially require it,</HI> are in&s;tructed, it matters not to the Society whether it be in this, or that corner of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">
ANOTHER principle which the Society will do well to attend to, <HI>is, to guard again&s;t a too liberal di&s;tribution of their funds in the fir&s;t in&s;tance.</HI> By this ob&s;ervation, it is not meant to in&s;inuate that they &s;hould re&s;train a liberal &s;pirit. Good men have amply endued the Society; and the only return which they can make, is to devote their gifts to the great and important ends for which they were be&s;towed. It is &s;ugge&s;ted only that they &s;hould be careful to avoid anticipating by a premature application, funds which they may hereafter &s;ee cau&s;e to apply to &s;till more important and beneficial purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The late &s;urpri&s;ing increa&s;e of the Society's &s;tock has been publi&s;hed every where, and excited a general de|&s;ire in the Highlands and I&s;lands to profit by it. Many applications have been made in con&s;equence, and many more may be expected. Among the&s;e, let the Di|rectors, after a careful and mature inve&s;tigation, &s;elect tho&s;e which &s;hall appear mo&s;t likely to prove immedi|ately beneficial to the country. Let them be on their guard again&s;t plau&s;ible repre&s;entations and general and fair promi&s;es. Promi&s;es are ea&s;ily made, and where the acqui&s;ition of money is the object, the inhabitants of a poor country are generally profu&s;e of them; but the Society may learn, from pa&s;t experience, to take every po&s;&s;ible precaution in order to &s;ecure perform|ance. By this plan of proceeding, they may, and probably will, give offence to, and bring upon them|&s;elves the reproaches of intere&s;ted individuals; but they will thus mo&s;t effectually guard again&s;t jobbing, and be&s;t promote the general intere&s;t of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">
The Secretary, though he pre&s;umes to throw out this general hint with re&s;pect to caution in the de&s;tina|tion of their new funds, yet takes the liberty to &s;ay to the Directors, and to the Society, that upon peru&s;ing his report, he hopes the members will find no cau&s;e to accu&s;e him of a narrow or illiberal &s;pirit in conducting his tour. Though he ever made it his endeavour to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary expence; yet he con&s;idered him&s;elf as the confidential &s;ervant and repre&s;entative of a great and re&s;pectable community, furni&s;hed with ample funds for promoting public and important objects. He travelled in countries where the fruits of the Society's bounty had been hitherto but &s;paringly &s;cattered; and the nature of the in&s;titution, and the character of its members but imperfectly known. It behoved him therefore to act, not as his own humble &s;phere, and narrow funds would have dictated, but in the &s;pirit of that character with which he was inve&s;ted. In every ca&s;e he &s;tudied to act as it occurred to him his con&s;tituents would have wi&s;hed him to do. If, after receiving <HI>certain</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Intelligence of this legacy was received, but not &s;ufficiently authen|ticated, when the Secretary &s;et out upon his journey.</NOTE> infor|mation of the &s;plendid legacy of Lord Vanvryhou|ven, he gave more largely to the poor neglected teachers of the Society than otherwi&s;e he would have thought him&s;elf warranted to do, he imagined that Providence, by furni&s;hing the <HI>means,</HI> conveyed the <HI>in|&s;truction,</HI> to relieve the wants and make glad the hearts of tho&s;e &s;uffering, and &s;ome of them very meritorious &s;ervants of the public; and in &s;o doing, he per&s;uades him&s;elf the Directors will not think he has exceeded
<PB N="89" REF="91">
the di&s;cretionary powers with which they inve&s;ted him.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the&s;e few general ob&s;ervations, the Secretary begs leave to &s;ubjoin the following? opo&s;i|tions towards the formation of a plan for the di&s;po|&s;al of the newly acquired, and great acce&s;&s;ion to the So|ciety's &s;tock.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure is particularly urgent in many of the we&s;tern coa&s;ts and i&s;lands, where the extreme poverty of the inhabitants renders them unable, and their own ignorance aver&s;e, to be&s;tow even a trifle for the education of their children. In many in&s;tances, during his la&s;t tour, the Secretary, in order to induce parents to &s;end their chil|dren to &s;chool, was obliged to promi&s;e them a total exemption from fees of every &s;ort, be&s;ides furni&s;hing them with books.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries the price of meal is always higher than upon the ea&s;t coa&s;t, and in the low countries of Scotland. This la&s;t Summer it was on an average, at lea&s;t 18 s. <HI>per</HI> boll. The difficulty of tran&s;porting it to the interior parts of countries where there are no roads, greatly enhances the price to &s;choolma&s;ters, who have no &s;ervants or hor&s;es of their own. The Secretary &s;ound &s;ome who had paid no le&s;s than 25 s. <HI>per</HI> boll for it, when laid down at their hou&s;es. In not a few ca&s;es during the cour&s;e of la&s;t Summer, they could not, for weeks together, obtain it at any price. It may appear incredible, but is neverthele&s;s an undoubted fact, that in the months of June and July la&s;t, there was not an ounce of meal to be obtained for money by the people of &s;ome exten&s;ive di&s;tricts and i&s;lands&mdash;their potatoes were exhau&s;ted, and they were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of living wholly on &s;i&s;h and milk. Cockles and other &s;hell-fi&s;h were often their chief &s;upport. How much, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is a man to be pitied who has to maintain him&s;elf and a family upon a &s;alary of 10 l. or 12 l.?</P>
<P>Parochial &s;choolma&s;ters in the&s;e countries are in very little better condition than tho&s;e of the &s;ociety. The <HI>maximum</HI> of the legal &s;alary, together with the trifling addition of their fees as &s;e&s;&s;ion clerks, and what they receive from the few who can afford to pay for education to their children, make altogether but a mi&s;erable provi&s;ion for a man of <HI>&s;ome</HI> education and literature, with a family. In a variety of ca&s;es, they are re&s;tricted to the <HI>minimum,</HI> or 5 l. 11. s. 1 d. 4-12ths. The con&s;equence is, that men of merit cannot be found to &s;upply the&s;e &s;tations, or to re|main in them; and in fact, many of them are vacant. In &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, the &s;alaries of two, in &s;ome of three or four pari&s;hes, are united to con&s;titute a decent provi&s;ion for one &s;choolma&s;ter for them all.

<P>The <HI>fourth.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A variety of cau&s;es have contributed to produce that rage for emi|gration to America, which now obtains, in many parts of the High|lands and I&s;lands. Among the&s;e are to be numbered, it is true, the cau&s;es commonly a&s;&s;igned, <HI>viz.</HI> the di&s;peopling, in great mea&s;ure, of large tracts of country in order to make room for &s;heep;&mdash;the conver|&s;ion of &s;mall into great farms, to the exclu&s;ion of the inferior order of tenants:&mdash;the prejudice, almo&s;t invincible, which many Highland pro|p ietors entertain again&s;t granting any lea&s;es, or lea&s;es of a &s;ufficient length to encourage the tenants to improve their farms;&mdash;the eagerne&s;s with which &s;ome landholders rai&s;e their rents, while they furni&s;h nei|ther the <HI>means</HI> nor in&s;truction as to the <HI>manner</HI> by which the tenants may be enabled to pay them; the non-re&s;idence of the proprietors, and their total want of tenderne&s;s for, or attention to their people, in con&s;equence of which the ancient confidence and affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Chiefs and their&punc;clans are <HI>greatly</HI> weakened, in &s;ome parts of the country, <HI>totally</HI> annihilated. Add to the&s;e, the claims of affection and kindred, vehemently urged, by tho&s;e who have already emigrated, on their friends and neighbours at home, to induce them to follow their example; and the flattering, perhaps in&s;idious, repre&s;entations of agents, employ|ed by purcha&s;ers of land in America to engage &s;ettlers to remove to their e&s;tates&mdash;add likewi&s;e, the contagion of example, and the infec|tious &s;pirit of wandering, which often, without rea&s;on from the imme|diate pre&s;&s;ure of grievances felt, &s;eizes upon a body of people; and you have a li&s;t of the commonly a&s;&s;igned, and in part true cau&s;es of emigra|tion. At the &s;ame time, an attentive and general ob&s;ervation of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Highlands and I&s;lands, it is imagined, will fully warrant the a&s;&s;ertion, that the great and mo&s;t univer&s;ally operating cau&s;e of emigration, is, <HI>that in compari&s;on of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which they afford, the&s;e countries are greatly over-&s;tocked with inhabitants.</HI></P>
<P>Inte&s;tine wars and feuds, by which numbers of them in former ages were cut off, have for many years been unknown. No drains for the &s;upply of the army and navy have of late been made. Add to this, that the people are prolific to an uncommon degree. Want and mi&s;ery &s;taring them in the face, prevent not, among the&s;e &s;imple uncorrupted people, the early marriage of both &s;exes; and the children &s;eldom &s;ail to be numerous.</P>
<P>The climate in the&s;e countries is generally unfriendly to the growth of corn. Rains prevail through a great part of the year; &s;eed-time and harve&s;t are late, and the &s;canty crop is with difficulty got in, &s;eldom without injury from the weather. Oats and barlcy, or rather bear, both of an inferior kind, are almo&s;t the only &s;pecies of grain rai&s;ed in the&s;e countries. Oats, at an average, yield only about three, and bear about &s;ix returns. The expence of rai&s;ing even the&s;e poor crops, in compari&s;on of their value, is immen&s;e. From the&s;e various cau&s;es, many mo&s;t intelligent ob&s;ervers of the &s;tate of the&s;e countries are of opinion, that the rai&s;ing of corn ought &s;eldom comparatively to be attempted in the We&s;tern Highlands and I&s;lands, and that the attention of farmers ought to be confined to the improvement of their pa&s;ture lands, and the cultivation of potatoes, and other green crops.&mdash;Were the odious and unproductive tax upon coal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be aboli&s;hed, and the &s;alt-laws &s;o a|mended or explained, that that e&s;&s;ential commodity might be furni&s;hed in abundance to the people for the curing of their fi&s;h for home-con&s;ump|tion, their condition would be amended to an a&s;toni&s;hing degree. But to the compleat improvement of the country, and the &s;ituation of its in|habitants, the introductios of manufactures is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Of the&s;e they are ignorant to a degree almo&s;t inconceivable by people who live only a hundred miles from them.</P>
<P>Spinning <HI>at the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eel</HI> the &s;imple&s;t branch of female indu&s;try, is in many parts of the country almo&s;t unknown. The coar&s;e cloths u&s;ed for home con&s;umption, both linen and woollen, are &s;pun by the women on the <HI>di&s;taff,</HI> chiefly while engaged in attending the cattle, or in the la|bours of the field, a great part of the drudgery of which is performed by <HI>them,</HI> while the men are either idle, or engaged in fi&s;hing. Women carry &s;ea weed to the kelp kilns, and manure to the fields, on their backs; and in many re&s;pects are u&s;ed as lea&s;es of burden. To almo&s;t all the arts of female indu&s;try within doors they are &s;trangers; &s;o that the greate&s;t part of the winter months they &s;pend in ab&s;olute idlene&s;s, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting, along with the re&s;t of the families to which they belong, upon two meals of the coar&s;e&s;t fare in the 24 hours; and happy would the bulk of the people in the&s;e countries deem them&s;elves, if even of &s;uch fare they had twice in the day what would &s;atisfy the demands of na|ture.</P>
<P>The introduction of manufactures into the&s;e countries of all expedients is the be&s;t adapted for their improvement. This is a propo&s;ition too ob+vious to require proof or illu&s;tration. Difficulties, as may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t attend the accompli&s;hment of this object; but were pro|prietors to pay that attention to it which its importance to their own intere&s;t, as well as the happine&s;s of their people, demand, it is imagined that the&s;e difficulties would &s;oon be &s;ound not only not un&s;urmountable, but ea&s;y to be overcome.</P>
<P>Among the cau&s;es which contributed to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of former attempts for the introduction of manufactures into the Highlands, may be reckoned the very great expence in buildings, &s;alaries to agents, factors, &amp;c. with which they were conducted, and their aiming at too high objects at the out&s;et.</P>
<P>To begin with the &s;imple&s;t principles; to make the people employed feel the immediate and <HI>full</HI> benefit of their own indu&s;try; and to proceed gradually, &s;uffering the manufacture to &s;upport it&s;elf, or nearly &s;o, in its various progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t probable, as it &s;urely is the lea&s;t hazardous mode of en&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;pinning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> hemp, cotton, or wool, is the fir&s;t &s;tep to|wards the introduction of the manufactures be&s;t adapted to the High|lands and I&s;lands. Different opinions are entertaines as to which of them the preference is due. The argument in &s;avour of <HI>wool.</HI> the raw material being the produce of the country, is unque&s;tionably &s;trong. But if inelination, convenience, or intere&s;t, &s;hould lead to a preference of any of the re&s;t, why &s;hould not the experiment be made? Let but the &s;pirit, the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">bits, and profits of indu&s;try, be introduced among the people, and one &s;pecies of manufacture will be found ly no means to interfere with another. It will rather excite an emulation favourable to all. Habits of application and indu&s;try, when once formed, may ea&s;ily be directed into that channel which experience &s;hall teach to be mo&s;t advantageous.</P>
<P>Indolence is commonly con&s;idered as the mo&s;t predominant feature in the character of the Highlanders&mdash;nothing can he a greater mi&s;take&mdash;no people are more quick-&s;ighted in di&s;cerning their own intere&s;t, when placed within the &s;phere of their ob&s;ervation, or more patient and per|&s;evering in its pur&s;uit. If, indeed, when but half fed and half clothed, their &s;pirit broken by oppre&s;&s;ion, and they forced to labour not for them&s;elves or their families, but for others, their exertions are but feeble, it is not to be wondered. But whenever the Highlanders enjoy the common advantages which free Britons do in other parts of the kingdom, experience and ob&s;ervation warrant the a&s;&s;ertion, that they are excelled by none in quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion or alertne&s;s of execution. Their &s;pirit and activity in the army and navy are well known, and have been the &s;ubject of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> from per&s;ons of the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed character. Their &s;obriety regularity and &s;teadine&s;s in com|mon life, are no le&s;s highly celebrated by all who have had occa&s;ion to employ them as labourers or arti&s;ans in works in which u&s;e has taught them &s;kill and dexterity.</P>
<P>How much then will it be a &s;ubject of regret, if a body of people po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch natural capacities of u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;hall, in con&s;equence of the &s;pirit of emigration to America, which now prevails, be for ever lo&s;t to their own country!

<P>The report of Doctors Dick, Hyndman, &amp;c. app inted by the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly 1760 to vi&s;it the Highlands and I&s;lands is, on this point, equally ju&s;t and happily expre&s;&s;ed. <Q>Many pari&s;hes in the&s;e countries, e&s;pecially in the We&s;tern Highlands and I&s;lands, are &s;o exten&s;ive as to render the charge of them utterly di&s;proportioned to the ability of the mo&s;t active mini&s;ters. Several of them re&s;emble rather a province requiring the labours of a body of clergy, than a di&s;trict fit for the in|&s;pection of a &s;ingle pa&s;tor. When to the extent of the&s;e pari&s;hes we add the difficulty of communication between the &s;everal parts of them, from the rivers, lakes, and huge mountains, which inter&s;ect the we&s;|tern continent, and from the dangerous &s;eas which &s;eparate the&s;e i&s;lands, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that during a great part of the year many of the inhabitants mu&s;t be deprived of all corre&s;pondence with their pa&s;tors, and de&s;titute of all public means of in&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>With this repre&s;entation, tho&s;e of Doctor Walker in 1765, and in 1772, perfectly accord; and that the&s;e countries, in this re&s;pect, &s;till remain in the &s;ame melancholy &s;ituation, the Secretary of the Socie y had too abundant evidence, during the cour&s;e of his la&s;t tour.</P>
<P>The committee of the General A&s;&s;embly annually appointed to ma|nage the Royal bounty, (a donation of 1000 l. given every year by the King to the A&s;&s;embly, for the reformation of the Highlands and I&s;lands) have done what in them lay for the redre&s;s of this evil, by the appoint|ment of itinerant mini&s;ters, be&s;ides a number of catechi&s;ts. Of the former, twenty-three are at pre&s;ent upon their e&s;tabli&s;hment, in differ|ent parts of the Highlands and I&s;lands. Their &s;alaries &s;omewhat vary, but do not, at a medium, exceed 30 l. Small as this appointment is, it is as much as the limited fund of the committee enables them to give. And when it is con&s;idered that the far greater number of mi&s;&s;ionaries appointed by them have no dwelling-hou&s;es, and no accommodations of any &s;ort, &s;ave what they pay for out of this &s;mall allowance, it is not to be wondered, that the majority of them, di&s;&s;atisfied with their &s;ituation, &s;hould look out with anxiety for better &s;ettlements, or that their atten|tion and efforts &s;hould ever be directed to this object.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, that men &s;o &s;ituated can en|joy the re&s;pect, or di&s;charge the duties of the pa&s;toral office with the authority of mini&s;ters con&s;idered as connected with their people by the tie of comfortable accommodations, and an adequate income. Add to this, that few of them <HI>comparatively,</HI> have churches, or even decent hou&s;es adapted to the purpo&s;e, for conducting the wor&s;hip of God. Mo&s;t of them ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e different &s;tations, often at a great di&s;tance from one ano|ther, where they are bound to officiate. At the&s;e places the people of the di&s;tricts convene on the previou&s;ly appointed Lord's day; when the weather is tolerably favourable, they a&s;&s;emble on the &s;ide of a hill, or &s;ome where in the open air, and when it is otherwi&s;e, in &s;ome barn or hou&s;e, the fitte&s;t for the purpo&s;e which they can find in the neighbour|hood.

<P>When the&s;e facts are con&s;idered, (and they who are acquainted with the countries referred to, know that this is no exaggerated de&s;cription), the Directors of the Society will not &s;urely be blamed, if, as a prelimi|nary condition to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of every mi&s;&s;ion upon their funds, they &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon having the accommodations above mentioned fur|ni&s;hed to the mini&s;ter.

The Se|cretary was &s;orry to find &s;ome gentlemen of exten&s;ive landed property in di&s;tricts where e&s;tabli&s;hments of this kind are peculiarly wanted, aver&s;e to agree to the&s;e conditions; they were unwilling to be at the expence of the <HI>buildings,</HI> and their minds &s;eemed to revolt at the idea of re&s;igning the &s;mall portion of land above &s;pecified, for any purpo&s;e con|nected with the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>expence</HI> of <HI>plain</HI> hou&s;es, (and plain hou&s;es alone, if comfortable, and adapted to their &s;everal purpo&s;es, will be required) it cannot be great, as the tenants will, without doubt, cheerfully furni&s;h the carria|ges: and <HI>that proprietor</HI> mu&s;t have a limited income indeed, by whom it would be felt oppre&s;&s;ive. And as to the &s;o much dreaded alienation of land to churchmen, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the few acres which may be granted to a Mi&s;&s;ionary-Mini&s;ter, will not be of the nature of a <HI>glebe,</HI> legally and irredeemably annexed to a living, on the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; they will be given only <HI>during,</HI> and revocable <HI>at</HI> plea&s;ure. The tran&s;action will be of the nature of a covenant or bargain between two contracting parties. The Society, on the one part, &s;hall agree, that while the &s;tate of the di&s;trict &s;hall require &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the proprietor, or proprietors, &s;hall continue to afford the &s;tipulated accom|modations, <HI>they</HI> &s;hall allow to a mi&s;&s;ionary mini&s;ter there, &s;uch a &s;alary as &s;hall be &s;pecified in the agreement. The terms on the part of the proprietor will exactly corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>Neither party, it is to be pre&s;umed, will ever act a part &s;o ab&s;urd, as, without evident nece&s;&s;ity, to violate the conditions of a tran&s;action of this public and important nature; but this much it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ugge&s;t, in order to remove the apprehen&s;ions of the Society's de&s;ign to lay perpetual unalterable burdens upon landed property.</P>
<P>Though the Secretary found that the above objections had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of &s;ome gentlemen of the Highlands, to leave room for hopes that <HI>they</HI> would agree to the conditions propo&s;|ed, yet he had the happine&s;s to meet with others animated by a diffe|rent &s;pirit, who were fully convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of having a great|er number of clergymen &s;ettled in the&s;e countries, and heartily di&s;po&s;|ed to afford every accommodation nece&s;&s;ary to render their &s;ituation comfortable and re&s;pectable. With one gentleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">Leod.</NOTE>, proprietor of a very great extent of country, the Directors have made &s;ome progre&s;s in a tran&s;action for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mi&s;&s;ionary mini&s;ter upon his e|&s;tate, and in a &s;ituation where an in&s;titution of this kind is peculiarly needed. His conduct has been liberal in no common degree, and has made a corre&s;ponding impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of the Directors.</P>
<P>Other gentlemen have declared their willingne&s;s to act the &s;ame part, who&s;e propo&s;als are under con&s;ideration. Their example, it is to be hoped, will be followed by proprietors in other parts of the country where the defect of the means of in&s;truction, and of the ordinances of religion, is one of the great evils felt and complaiued of by the people.</P>
<P>If the Society &s;hall be willing to take upon them&s;elves the greate&s;t burden of e&s;tabli&s;hments of this nature, which certainly is the annual &s;alaries of the mini&s;ters, it cannot but appear hard, that gentlemen of rank and fortune &s;hould deprive their own people of the benefit re&s;ult|ing from them, on account of the comparatively trifling expence of the accommodations required.</P></NOTE> The e&s;tabli&s;hment of mi&s;&s;ionary mini&s;ters in parts of the country where they are peculiarly wanted,

to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h mi&s;&s;ions</HI> upon their own proper funds. The will of Lady Glenorchy gives them undi&s;putable authority to this effect, over the intere&s;t of 2500 l. the unappropriated moiety of her legacy to the Directors. The va&s;t extent of many pa&s;toral charges in the High|lands and i&s;lands, and the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of the few e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ters di&s;charging with pro|priety and effect the duties of their office, render an
<PB N="101" REF="103">
increa&s;e of their number a mo&s;t de&s;irable and import|ant object.</P>
<P>The Secretary has mentioned, in the cour&s;e of his Journal, a few places, in different parts of the coun|try, where &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments are greatly needed, and where the proprietors expre&s;&s;ed a hearty willingne&s;s to give whatever accommodations the Directors might think proper to demand for the mini&s;ters. Tho&s;e which the Secretary took the liberty to mention, and without which, in his opinion, no mi&s;&s;ion ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Society, are a comfortable dwel|ling-hou&s;e, with &s;uitable offices (a &s;table, barn and byre), as much land free of rent, both arable and pa&s;|ture, as will maintain a hor&s;e and two cows through|out the whole year; and a decent place, or places ap|propriated for wor&s;hip, wherever he &s;hall be bound &s;tatedly to perform divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>With the&s;e accommodations, and a competent &s;ala|ry, (&s;uppo&s;e 50l. <HI>per annum),</HI> a mini&s;ter may be com|fortable and re&s;pected in any part of the Highlands and I&s;lands: without the&s;e he mu&s;t be poor and depen|dent; and con&s;equently his re&s;pect and u&s;efulne&s;s greatly ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>If the Directors &s;hall &s;ee proper to e&s;tabli&s;h mi&s;&s;ions, and they cannot do a more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to tho&s;e countries to which, by the con&s;titution of the Socie|ty, their attention is confined, let them by all means take care, that the clergymen in their employment, be placed upon &s;uch an independent footing as to have no temptation to &s;ervility of &s;pirit, di&s;contentment
<PB N="102" REF="104">
with their condition or for bread, to devote their time and attention to &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> and the only other propo&s;ition for the employment of their additional funds, which the Secre|tary &s;hall take the liberty to mention, is, <HI>a provi&s;ion to be made for training up &s;ome young men having the Gaelic Language, for the</HI> mini&s;try, <HI>in the Highlands and I&s;lands.</HI> This may be accompli&s;hed by the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a certain &s;peci&s;ied number of pen&s;ions or bur&s;avies for <HI>Students of Divinity.</HI> For Students of Philo&s;ophy, there is not &s;o much occa&s;ion. The rules of the different Univer&s;ities, as well as the laws of the Church, oblige every young man intended for the mini&s;try, to &s;tudy a regular cour&s;e of Philo&s;ophy; and during that cour&s;e there are many more aids from bur&s;aries to be obtained than in that of Divinity. Be|&s;ides, were the Society to e&s;tabli&s;h bur&s;aries for Phi|lo&s;ophy, they could have no &s;ecurity that the young men who enjoyed them, would pro&s;ecute the &s;tudy of Divinity.</P>
<P>What the Secretary therefore begs leave to &s;ugge&s;t upon this &s;ubject is, that &s;uch young men, having the Gaelic language, and having fini&s;hed their cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy, as the Directors may choo&s;e to prefer, &s;hall undergo an examination by &s;ome of their own members; and upon being found to have made a com|petent progre&s;s in their &s;everal branches of education, &s;hall be appointed each to a pen&s;ion, or bur&s;ary, <HI>(of &s;uppo&s;e</HI> 15 <HI>l.)</HI> upon the&s;e expre&s;s conditions, that du|ring four &s;e&s;&s;ions (the duration of the bur&s;ary) they &s;hall re&s;ide com&s;tantly at Edinburgh, and thus be under
<PB N="103" REF="105">
the immediate in&s;pection of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical members of the Society, and enjoy the benefit of their advice and patronage, if they &s;hall be found to de&s;erve it; that they &s;hall regularly attend the Divinity Hail, and the &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ors, who&s;e cla&s;&s;es &s;hall be recom|mended to them, and without engaging in any other bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hall devote their whole time and attention to their proper &s;tudies.</P>
<P>By this plan, through the Divine ble&s;&s;ing, it is to be hoped, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able and well educated young men may be trained up for &s;upplying the mi&s;|&s;ions which may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Society, as well as other charges in the Highlands and I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Thus the Secretary has taken the liberty to &s;tate to the Directors the ideas which have occurred to him upon this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The nature of his office, and his con&s;tant employment in the a&s;&s;airs of the Society, may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have direct|ed much of his attention to the in&s;titution, and to all tho&s;e methods by which its great and benevolent ob|jects may be&s;t be promoted; and the above plan, after mature deliberation, appears to him the be&s;t which they can adopt for employing their additional funds. He &s;ubmits it, with deference, to the con&s;ideration of his con&s;tituents."</P>
<P>The Directors having read and con&s;idered the above paper, with much attention, re&s;erred it to a general meeting of the Society, by whom the &s;pirit and ob|jects of the plan contained in it, were unanimou&s;ly ap|proved, and referred back to the Directors to be &s;till more maturely dige&s;ted, and carried into execution, as circum&s;tances may permit.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">
By ordering it to be printed, as a part of the Ap|pendix to the anniver&s;ary &s;ermon of the pre&s;ent year, the Directors will have an opportunity of learning the &s;entiments of the public concerning it; <HI>of tho&s;e</HI> par|ticularly who have directed their attention to the &s;itu|ation of the Highlands and I&s;lands, and the means mo&s;t proper to be u&s;ed for their improvement.&mdash;The publication of the&s;e propo&s;als, be&s;ides, will have the effect to &s;atisfy the public, that although the funds of the Society have of late received a large addi|tion, yet objects of great importance to the country are by no means wanting, &s;ufficient, and far more than &s;ufficient, to exhau&s;t them. The Directors are fully determined again&s;t hoarding up, or wrapping in a nap|kin, the talents committed to them; on the contrary, in the &s;pirit, with which they tru&s;t their revenue has hitherto been managed, their fixed purpo&s;e is to lay out the <HI>whole,</HI> as &s;peedily as prudence will permit, in promoting tho&s;e objects which &s;hall appear to be be&s;t calculated for promoting the improvement of the&s;e parts of the kingdom to which their attention is di|rected. The mea&s;ures which they may adopt for this purpo&s;e &s;hall, from time to time, be faithfully &s;tated to the public. If they &s;hall be &s;o happy as to pre&s;erve their continuing confidence; and, above all, if their faithful endeavours &s;hall be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in promoting the be&s;t intere&s;ts of religion and their fellow creatures, a monitor within their own bo&s;oms will tell them that THEIR REWARD IS GREAT.</P>
