<HEAD>DISCOURSE I. <HI>Of Commerce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of mankind may be di|vided into two cla&s;&s;es; that of <HI>&s;hallow</HI> thinkers, who fall &s;hort of the truth, and that of <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e</HI> thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter cla&s;s are by far the mo&s;t uncommon, and I may add, by far the mo&s;t u&s;eful and valuable. They &s;ugge&s;t hints, at lea&s;t, and &s;tart difficulties, which they want, perhaps, &s;kill to pur&s;ue, but which may produce very fine di&s;coveries, when handled by men who have a more ju&s;t way of thinking. At wor&s;t, what they &s;ay is uncom|mon; and if it &s;hould co&s;t &s;ome pains to compre|hend it, one has, however, the plea&s;ure of hear|ing &s;omething that is new. An author is little to be valu'd, who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffee-hou&s;e conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>ALL people of <HI>&s;hallow</HI> thought are apt to decry even tho&s;e of <HI>&s;olid</HI> under&s;tanding as <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e</HI> think|&s;cience
<PB N="2" REF="5">
ers and metaphy&s;icians and refiners; and never will allow any thing to be ju&s;t, which is beyond their own weak conceptions. There are &s;ome ca&s;|es, I own, where an extraordinary refinement affords a &s;trong pre&s;umption of fal&s;hood, and where no rea&s;oning is to be tru&s;ted but what is na|tural and ea&s;y. When a man deliberates concern|ing his conduct in any <HI>particular</HI> affair, and forms &s;chemes in politics, trade, oeconomy, or any bu&s;i|ne&s;s in life, he never ought to draw his arguments too fine, or connect too long a chain of con&s;equen|ces together. Something is &s;ure to happen, that will di&s;concert his rea&s;oning, and produce an e|vent different from what he expected. But when we rea&s;on upon <HI>general</HI> &s;ubjects, one may ju&s;tly affirm, that our &s;peculations can &s;carce ever be too fine, provided they be ju&s;t; and that the diffe|rence betwixt a common man and a man of ge|nius, is chiefly &s;een in the &s;hallowne&s;s or depth of the principles, upon which they proceed. Gene|ral rea&s;onings &s;eem intricate, merely becau&s;e they are general; nor is it ea&s;y for the bulk of mankind to di&s;tingui&s;h, in a great number of particulars, that common circum&s;tance, in which they all a|gree, or to extract it, pure and unmixt, from the other &s;uperfluous circum&s;tances. Every judgment or conclu&s;ion, with them, is particular. They cannot enlarge their view to tho&s;e univer&s;al pro|po&s;itions, which comprehend under them an infi|nite number of individuals, and include a whole
<PB N="3" REF="6">
in a &s;ingle theorem. Their eye is con|founded with &s;uch an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and the conclu&s;ions deriv'd from it, even tho' clearly ex|pre&s;t, &s;eem intricate and ob&s;cure. But however intricate they may &s;eem, 'tis certain, that general principles, if ju&s;t and &s;ound, mu&s;t always prevail in the general cour&s;e of things, tho' they may fail in particular ca&s;es; and 'tis the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophers to regard the general cour&s;e of things. I may add, that 'tis al&s;o the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of poli|ticians; e&s;pecially in the dome&s;tic government of the &s;tate, where the public good, which is, or ought to be their object, depends on the concur|rence of a multitude of ca&s;es; not, as in foreign po|litics, upon accidents, and chances, and the ca|prices of a few per&s;ons. This therefore makes the difference betwixt <HI>particular</HI> deliberations and <HI>ge|neral</HI> rea&s;onings, and renders &s;ubtilty and refine|ment much more &s;uitable to the latter than to the former.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this introduction nece&s;&s;ary before the following di&s;cour&s;es on <HI>commerce, luxury, money, intere&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. where, perhaps, there will occur &s;ome principles, which are uncommon, and which may &s;eem too refin'd and &s;ubtile for &s;uch vulgar &s;ubjects. If fal&s;e, let them be rejected: but no one ought to entertain a prejudice again&s;t them, merely becau&s;e they are out of the common road.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
THE greatne&s;s of a &s;tate and the happine&s;s of its &s;ubjects, however independent they may be &s;up|pos'd in &s;ome re&s;pects, are commonly allow'd to be in&s;eparable with regard to commerce; and as pri|vate men receive greater &s;ecurity, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their trade and riches, from the power of the public, &s;o the public becomes powerful in propor|tion to the riches and exten&s;ive commerce of pri|vate men. This maxim is true in general; tho' I cannot forbear thinking, that it may po&s;&s;ibly admit of &s;ome exceptions, and that we often e&s;ta|bli&s;h it with too little re&s;erve and limitation. There may be &s;ome circum&s;tances, where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals, in&s;tead of adding &s;trength to the public, may &s;erve only to thin its armies, and dimini&s;h its authority among the neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable being and &s;u&s;ceptible of many different opinions, principles, and rules of conduct. What may be true while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be found fal&s;e, when he has embrac'd an oppo&s;ite &s;et of manners and opinions.</P>
<P>THE bulk of every &s;tate may be divided into <HI>husbandmen</HI> and <HI>manufacturers.</HI> The former are employ'd in the culture of the land. The latter work up the materials furni&s;h'd by the former, in|to all the commodities, which are nece&s;&s;ary or or|namental to human life. As &s;oon as men quit their &s;avage &s;tate, where they live chiefly by hunt|the
<PB N="5" REF="8">
ing and fi&s;hing, they mu&s;t fall into the&s;e two cla&s;&s;|es; tho' the arts of agriculture employ <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> the mo&s;t numerous part of the &s;ociety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;. <HI>Melon</HI> in his political e&s;&s;ay on commerce a&s;&s;erts, that even at pre&s;ent, if you divide <HI>France</HI> into 20 parts, 16 are labour|ers or pea&s;ants, 2 only artizans, one belonging to the law, church and military, and one merchants, financiers and bourgeois. This calculation is certainly very erroneous. In <HI>France, England,</HI> and indeed mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> half of the inhabitants live in cities, and even of tho&s;e who live in the country, a very great number are artizans, perhaps above a third,</NOTE>. Time and experience improve &s;o much the&s;e arts, that the land may ea&s;ily maintain a much greater number of men, than tho&s;e who are immediately em|ploy'd in its cultivation, or who furni&s;h the more nece&s;&s;ary manufactures to &s;uch as are &s;o employ'd.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e &s;uperfluous hands be turn'd towards the finer arts, which are commonly denominated the arts of <HI>luxury,</HI> they add to the happine&s;s of the &s;tate; &s;ince they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments, with which they would otherways have been unacquainted. But may not another &s;cheme be propos'd for the employment of the&s;e &s;uperfluous hands? May not the &s;overeign lay claim to them, and employ them in fleets and armies, to increa&s;e the dominions of the &s;tate a|broad, and &s;pread its fame over di&s;tant nations? 'Tis certain, that the fewer de&s;ires and wants are found in the proprietors and labourers of land, the fewer hands do they employ; and con&s;equently
<PB N="6" REF="9">
&s;uperfluities of the land, in&s;tead of maintain|ing trade&s;men and manufacturers, may &s;upport fleets and armies to a much greater extent, than where a great many arts are requir'd to mini&s;ter to the luxury of particular per&s;ons. Here there|fore &s;eems to be a kind of oppo&s;ition betwixt the greatne&s;s of the &s;tate and the happine&s;s of the &s;ub|jects. A &s;tate is never greater than when all its &s;uperfluous hands are employ'd in the &s;ervice of the public. The ea&s;e and convenience of private per&s;ons require, that the&s;e hands &s;hould be em|ploy'd in their &s;ervice. The one can never be &s;atis|fied, but at the expence of the other. As the am|bition of the &s;overeign mu&s;t entrench on the luxury of individuals; &s;o the luxury of individuals mu&s;t di|mini&s;h the force, and check the ambition of the &s;o|vereign.</P>
<P>NOR is this rea&s;oning merely chimerical; but is founded on hi&s;tory and experience. The repub|lic of <HI>Sparta</HI> was certainly more powerful than any &s;tate now in the world, con&s;i&s;ting of an equal number of people; and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury. The <HI>Helotes</HI> were the labourers: The <HI>Spartans</HI> were the &s;oldi|ers or gentlemen. 'Tis evident, that the labour of the <HI>Helotes</HI> could not have maintain'd &s;o great a number of <HI>Spartans,</HI> had the&s;e latter liv'd in ea&s;e and delicacy, and given employment to a great va|riety of trades and manufactures. The like poli|cy may be remark'd in <HI>Rome;</HI> and indeed, thro'
<PB N="7" REF="10">
all antient hi&s;tory, 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the &s;mall|e&s;t republics rais'd and maintain'd greater armies than &s;tates, con&s;i&s;ting of triple the number of in|habitants, are able to &s;upport at pre&s;ent. 'Tis computed that, in all <HI>European</HI> nations, the propor|tion betwixt &s;oldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred. But we read, that the city of <HI>Rome</HI> alone, with its &s;mall territory, rais'd and maintain'd, in early times, ten legions again&s;t the <HI>Latins. Athens,</HI> who&s;e whole dominions were not larger than <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> &s;ent to the expedition again&s;t <HI>Sicily</HI> near forty thou&s;and men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thucydides,</HI> lib. 7.</NOTE>. <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the elder, 'tis &s;aid, maintain'd a &s;tanding army of a hundred thou&s;and foot and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, be|&s;ide a large fleet of four hundred &s;ail;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diod. Sic.</HI> lib. 2. This account, I own, is &s;omewhat &s;u&s;pi|cious, not to &s;ay wor&s;e; chiefly becau&s;e this army was not com|po&s;ed of citizens, but of mercenary forces. See di&s;cour&s;e X.</NOTE> tho' his territories extended no farther than the city of <HI>Sy|racu&s;e,</HI> about a third part of the i&s;land of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and &s;ome &s;ea-port towns or garri&s;ons on the coa&s;t of <HI>I|taly</HI> and <HI>Illyricum.</HI> 'Tis true, the antient armies, in time of war, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted much upon plunder: But did not the enemy plunder in their turn? which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than a|ny other that could be devis'd. In &s;hort, no prob|able rea&s;on can be given for the great power of the more antient &s;tates above the modern, but their
<PB N="8" REF="11">
want of commerce and luxury. Few artizans were maintain'd by the labour of the farmers, and there|fore more &s;oldiers might live upon it. <HI>Titus Li|vius</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Rome,</HI> in his time, would find it dif|ficult to rai&s;e as large an army as that which, in her early days, &s;he &s;ent out again&s;t the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Latins</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Titi Livit l.b. 7. cap. 25. Adeo in quae laboramus,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;o|la crevimus, divitias luxurianque.</HI></NOTE>. In&s;tead of tho&s;e &s;oldiers who fought for liberty and empire in <HI>Camillus</HI>'s time, there were, in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s days, mu&s;icians, painters, cooks, play|ers and taylors. And if the land was equally cul|tivated at both periods, 'tis evident it could main|tain equal numbers in the one profe&s;&s;ion as in the other. They added nothing to the mere nece&s;&s;a|ries of life, in the latter period more than in the former.</P>
<P>'TIS natural on this occa&s;ion to ask, whether &s;overeigns may not return to the maxims of anti|ent policy, and con&s;ult their own intere&s;t, in this re&s;pect, more than the happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects? I an&s;wer, that it appears to me almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible; and that becau&s;e antient policy was violent, and contrary to the more natural and u&s;ual cour&s;e of things. 'Tis well known with what peculiar laws <HI>Sparta</HI> was govern'd, and what a prodigy that re|public is ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd by every one, who has con&s;ider'd human nature, as it has di&s;play'd it&s;elf in other nations and other ages. Were the te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="9" REF="12">
of hi&s;tory le&s;s po&s;itive and circum&s;tantial, &s;uch a government wou'd appear a mere philo&s;o|phical whim or fiction, and impo&s;&s;ible ever to be reduc'd to practice. And tho' the <HI>Roman</HI> and o|ther antient republics were &s;upported on princi|ples &s;omewhat more natural, yet was there a very extraordinary concurrence of circum&s;tances to make them &s;ubmit to &s;uch grievous burthens. They were free &s;tates; they were &s;mall ones; and the age be|ing martial, all the neighbouring &s;tates were con|tinually in arms. Freedom naturally begets pu|blic &s;pirit, e&s;pecially in &s;mall &s;tates; and this pu|blic &s;pirit, this <HI>amor patriae,</HI> mu&s;t increa&s;e, when the public is almo&s;t in continual alarm, and men are oblig'd, every moment, to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the greate&s;t dangers for its defence. A continu|al &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wars makes every citizen a &s;oldi|er: They take the field in their turn; and during their &s;ervice are chiefly maintain'd by them&s;elves. And, notwith&s;tanding that this &s;ervice is equivalent to a very &s;evere tax, 'tis le&s;s felt by a people addict|ed to arms, who fight for honour and revenge more than pay, and are unacquainted with gain and in|du&s;try as well as plea&s;ure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The more antient <HI>Romans</HI> liv'd in perpetual war with all their neighbours, and in old <HI>Latin,</HI> the term, <HI>ho&s;tis,</HI> expre&s;t both a &s;tranger and an enemy. This is remark'd by <HI>Cicero;</HI> but by him is a&s;cribed to the humanity of his ance&s;tors, who &s;oftened, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the &s;ame appellation which &s;ignified a &s;tranger: <HI>De off.</HI> lib. 2. 'Tis however much more probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of tho&s;e people was &s;o great as to make them re|gard all &s;trangers as enemies, and call them by the &s;ame name. It is not, be&s;ides, con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t common maxims of policy or of nature, that any &s;tate &s;hou'd regard its public enemies with a friendly eye, or pre&s;erve any &s;uch &s;entiments for them as the <HI>Roman</HI> orator would a&s;cribe to his ance&s;tors. Not to mention, that the early <HI>Romans</HI> really exerci&s;ed piracy, as we learn from their fir&s;t treaties with <HI>Carthage,</HI> pre&s;erved by <HI>Polybius,</HI> lib. 3. and con&s;equently, like the <HI>Sall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> and <HI>Algerine</HI> rovers, were actu|ally at war with mo&s;t nations, and a &s;tranger and an enemy were with them almo&s;t &s;ynonimous.</NOTE> Not to mention the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
great equality of fortunes among&s;t the inhabitants of the antient republics, where every field, belong|ing to a different proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and render'd the numbers of citizens very con&s;iderable, even without trade and manufactures.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the want of trade and manufactures, among&s;t a free and very martial people, may <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> have no other effect than to render the public more powerful; 'tis certain, that, in the common cour&s;e of human affairs, it will have a quite con|trary tendency. Sovereigns mu&s;t take mankind as they find them, and cannot pretend to introduce a|ny violent change in their principles and ways of thinking. A long cour&s;e of time, with a variety of accidents and circum&s;tances, are requi&s;ite to pro|duce tho&s;e great revolutions, which &s;o much diver|&s;ify the face of human affairs. And the le&s;s natu|ral any &s;et of principles are, which &s;upport a par|ticular &s;ociety, the more difficulty will a legi&s;lator
<PB N="11" REF="14">
meet with in rai&s;ing and cultivating them. 'Tis his be&s;t policy to comply with the common bent of man|kind, and give it all the improvements, of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. Now, according to the mo&s;t natural cour&s;e of things, indu&s;try and arts and trade in|crea&s;e the power of the &s;overeign as well as the happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects; and that policy is vio|lent, which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals. This will ea&s;ily appear from a few con&s;iderations, which will pre&s;ent to us the con&s;e|quences of &s;loth and barbarity.</P>
<P>WHERE manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated, the bulk of the people mu&s;t apply them&s;elves to agriculture; and if their skill and in|du&s;try increa&s;e, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a great &s;uperfluity from their labour beyond what &s;uffices to maintain them. They have no temptation, therefore, to in|crea&s;e their &s;kill and indu&s;try; &s;ince they cannot ex|change that &s;uperfluity for any commodities, which may &s;erve either to their plea&s;ure or vanity. A ha|bit of indolence naturally prevails. The greater part of the land lyes uncultivated. What is culti|vated, yields not its utmo&s;t, for want of &s;kill or a&s;|&s;iduity in the farmers. If at any time, the public exigencies require, that great numbers &s;hou'd be employed in the public &s;ervice, the labour of the people furni&s;hes now no &s;uperfluities, by which the&s;e numbers can be maintain'd. The labourers can|not increa&s;e their &s;kill and indu&s;try on a &s;udden.
<PB N="12" REF="15">
Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for &s;ome years. The armies, mean while, mu&s;t either make &s;udden and violent conque&s;ts, or di&s;|band for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. A regular attack or defence, therefore, is not to be expected from &s;uch a people, and their &s;oldiers mu&s;t be as ignorant and un&s;kilful as their farmers and manufacturers.</P>
<P>EVERY thing in the world is purchas'd by la|bour; and our pa&s;&s;ions are the only cau&s;es of la|bour. When a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land, as well as the farmers, &s;tudy agriculture as a &s;cience, and redouble their indu&s;try and attention. The &s;uper|fluity, which ari&s;es from their labour, is not lo&s;t; but is exchang'd with the manufacturers for tho&s;e commodities, which mens luxury now makes them covet. By this means, land furni&s;hes a great deal more of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, than what &s;uffices for tho&s;e who cultivate it. In times of peace and tranquillity, this &s;uperfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts. But 'tis ea&s;y for the public to convert many of the&s;e manufacturers into &s;oldiers, and maintain them by that &s;uperfluity, which ari&s;es from the labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that this is the ca&s;e in all civiliz'd governments. When the &s;ove|reign rai&s;es an army, what is the con&s;equence? He impo&s;es a tax. This tax obliges all the people to retrench what is lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
<PB N="13" REF="16">
Tho&s;e, who labour in &s;uch commodities, mu&s;t ei|ther enli&s;t in the troops, or turn them&s;elves to a|griculture, and thereby oblige &s;ome labourers to enli&s;t for want of bu&s;ine&s;s. And to con&s;ider the matter ab&s;tractly, manufactures increa&s;e the power of the &s;tate only as they &s;tore up &s;o much labour, and that of a kind, which the public may lay claim to, without depriving any one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The more labour, therefore, is employ'd beyond mere nece&s;&s;aries, the more powerful is any &s;tate; &s;ince the per&s;ons engag'd in that labour may ea&s;ily be converted to the public &s;ervice. In a &s;tate without manufactures, there may be the &s;ame number of hands; but there is not the &s;ame quantity of labour, nor of the &s;ame kind. All the labour is there be&s;tow'd upon nece&s;&s;aries, which can admit of little or no abatement.</P>
<P>THUS the greatne&s;s of the &s;overeign and the happine&s;s of the &s;tate are, in a great mea&s;ure, u|nited with regard to trade and manufactures. 'Tis a violent method, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es impracticable, to oblige the labourer to toil, in order to rai&s;e from the land more than what &s;ub&s;i&s;ts him&s;elf and fami|ly. Furni&s;h him with manufactures and commo|dities, and he will do it of him&s;elf. Afterwards, you will find it ea&s;y to &s;eize &s;ome part of his &s;u|perfluous labour, and employ it in the public &s;er|vice, without giving him his wonted return. Be|ing accu&s;tom'd to labour, he will think this le&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="17">
grievous, than if, at once, you oblig'd him to an augmentation of labour without any reward. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to the other members of the &s;tate. The greater is the &s;tock of labour of all kinds, the greater quantity may be taken from the heap, without making any &s;en&s;ible alteration upon it.</P>
<P>A PUBLIC granary of corn, a &s;tore-hou&s;e of cloth, a magazine of arms; all the&s;e mu&s;t be al|low'd to be real riches and &s;trength in any &s;tate. Trade and indu&s;try are really nothing; but a &s;tock of labour, which, in time of peace and tranquillity, is employ'd for the ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction of indivi|duals, but in the exigencies of &s;tate, may, in part, be turn'd to public advantage. Could we con|vert a city into a kind of fortified camp; and in|fu&s;e into each brea&s;t &s;o martial a genius, and &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for public good as to make every one willing to undergo the greate&s;t hard&s;hips for the &s;ake of the public; the&s;e affections might now, as in antient times, prove alone a &s;ufficient &s;pur to indu&s;try, and &s;upport the community. It would then be advan|tageous, as in camps, to bani&s;h all arts and luxury; and, by re&s;trictions on equipage and tables, make the provi&s;ions and forage la&s;t longer than if the ar|my were loaded with a number of &s;uperfluous re|tainers. But as the&s;e principles are too di&s;intere&s;t|ed and too difficult to &s;upport, 'tis requi&s;ite to go|vern men by other pa&s;&s;ions, and animate them with
<PB N="15" REF="18">
a &s;pirit of avarice and indu&s;try, art and luxury. The camp is, in this ca&s;e, loaded with a &s;uper|fluous retinue; but the provi&s;ions flow in pro|portionably larger. The harmony of the whole is &s;till &s;upported; and the natural bent of mens minds being more complied with, individuals, as well as the public, find their account in the ob&s;er|vance of tho&s;e maxims.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame method of rea&s;oning will let us &s;ee the advantage of <HI>foreign</HI> commerce, in augmenting the power of the &s;tate, as well as the riches and happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects. It increa&s;es the &s;tock of labour in the nation; and the &s;overeign may convert what &s;hare of it he finds nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ervice of the public. Foreign trade, by its im|ports, furni&s;hes materials for new manufactures. And by its exports, it produces labour in particu|lar commodities, which could not be con&s;um'd at home. In &s;hort, a kingdom, that has a large im|port and export, mu&s;t abound more with labour, and that upon delicacies and luxuries, than a king|dom, which re&s;ts contented with its native com|modities. It is, therefore, more powerful, as well as richer and happier. The individuals reap the benefit of the&s;e commodities, &s;o far as they gra|tify the &s;en&s;es and appetites. And the public is al&s;o a gainer, while a greater &s;tock of labour is, by this means, &s;tor'd up again&s;t any public exigen|cy; that is, a greater number of laborious men are
<PB N="16" REF="19">
maintain'd, who may be diverted to the public &s;er|vice, without robbing any one of the nece&s;&s;aries, or even the chief conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find, that in mo&s;t nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures, and given birth to dome&s;|tic luxury. The temptation is &s;tronger to make u&s;e of foreign commodities, which are ready for u&s;e, and which are entirely new to us, than to make improvements on any dome&s;tic commodity, which always advance by &s;low degrees, and never affect us by their novelty. The profit is al&s;o very great, in exporting what is &s;uperfluous at home, and what bears no price, to foreign nations, who&s;e &s;oil or climate is not favourable to that commodity. Thus men become acquainted with the <HI>plea&s;ures</HI> of lux|ury and the <HI>profits</HI> of commerce; and their <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> being once awaken'd, carry them to farther improvements, in every branch of dome&s;|tic as well as foreign trade. And this perhaps is the chief advantage, which ari&s;es from a com|merce with &s;trangers. It rou&s;es men from their lethargic indolence; and pre&s;enting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dream'd of, rai&s;es in them a de&s;ire of a more &s;plendid way of life than what their ance&s;tors enjoy'd. And, at the &s;ame time, the few merchants, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ecret of this importation and exportation, make exorbitant
<PB N="17" REF="20">
profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the antient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce. Imitation &s;oon diffu&s;es all tho&s;e arts; while dome&s;tic manufacturers emulate the foreign in their improvements, and work up e|very home-commodity to the utmo&s;t perfection, of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. Their own &s;teel and iron, in &s;uch laborious hands, become equal to the gold and rubies of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the affairs of the &s;ociety are once brought to this &s;ituation, a nation may lo&s;e mo&s;t of its fo|reign trade, and yet continue a great and powerful people. If &s;trangers will not take any particular commodity of ours, we mu&s;t cea&s;e to labour in it. The &s;ame hands will turn them&s;elves towards &s;ome refinement in other commodities, which may be wanted at home. And there mu&s;t always be ma|terials for them to work upon; till every per&s;on in the &s;tate, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es riches, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es as great plen|ty of home-commodities, and tho&s;e in as great per|fection, as he de&s;ires; which can never po&s;&s;ibly hap|pen. <HI>China</HI> is repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing empires in the world; tho' it has very little commerce beyond its own territories.</P>
<P>IT will not, I hope, be con&s;idered as a &s;uperflu|ous digre&s;&s;ion, if I here ob&s;erve, that, as the multi|tude of mechanical arts is advantageous, &s;o is the great number of per&s;ons, to who&s;e &s;hare the pro|ductions
<PB N="18" REF="21">
of the&s;e arts fall. A too great di&s;propor|tion among the citizens weakens any &s;tate. Every per&s;on, if po&s;&s;ible, ought to enjoy the fruits of his la|bour, in a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the nece&s;&s;aries, and many of the conveniencies of life. No-one can doubt, but &s;uch an equality is mo&s;t &s;uitable to hu|man nature, and dimini&s;hes much le&s;s from the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the rich than it adds to that of the poor. It al&s;o augments the <HI>power of the &s;tate,</HI> and makes any extraordinary taxes or impo&s;itions be paid with much more chearfulne&s;s. Where the riches are engro&s;s'd by a few, the&s;e mu&s;t contribute very large|ly to the &s;upplying the public nece&s;&s;ities. But when the riches are di&s;per&s;t among multitudes, the bur|then feels light on every &s;houlder, and the taxes make not a very &s;en&s;ible difference on any one's way of living.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that where the riches are in few hands, the&s;e mu&s;t enjoy all the power, and will readily con&s;pire to lay the whole burthen on the poor, and oppre&s;s them &s;till farther, to the di&s;cou|ragement of all indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IN this circum&s;tance con&s;i&s;ts the great advantage of <HI>England</HI> above any nation at pre&s;ent in the world, or that appears in the records of any &s;tory. 'Tis true, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> feel &s;ome di&s;advantages in foreign trade by the high price of labour, which is in part the effect of the riches of their artizans, as well as of
<PB N="19" REF="22">
the plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, 'tis not to be put in competition with the happine&s;s of &s;o many milli|ons. And if there were no more to endear to them that free government, under which they live, this alone were &s;ufficient. The poverty of the com|mon people is a natural, if not an infallible con&s;e|quence of ab&s;olute monarchy; tho' I doubt, whe|ther it be always true, on the other hand, that their riches are an infallible con&s;equence of liberty. That &s;eems to depend on particular accidents and a certain turn of thinking, in conjunction with li|berty. My lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> accounting for the great advantages obtain'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their wars with <HI>France,</HI> a&s;cribes them chiefly to the &s;uperior ea&s;e and plenty of the common people, among&s;t the former; yet the governments of the two king|doms were, at that time, pretty much alike. Where the labourers and artizans are accu&s;tom'd to work for low wages, and to retain but a &s;mall part of the fruits of their labour, 'tis difficult for them, even in a free government, to better their condition, or con&s;pire among them&s;elves to heighten their wages. But even where they are accu&s;tom'd to a more plentiful way of life, 'tis ea&s;y for the rich, in a de&s;|potic government, to con&s;pire again&s;t <HI>them,</HI> and throw the whole burthen of the taxes on their &s;houlders.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
IT may &s;eem an odd po&s;ition, that the poverty of the common people in <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, owing to the &s;uperior riches of the &s;oil and happine&s;s of the climate; and yet there want not many rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify this pa|radox. In &s;uch a fine mold or &s;oil as that of tho&s;e more &s;outhern regions, agriculture is an ea&s;y art; and one man, with a couple of &s;orry hor&s;es, will be able, in a &s;ea&s;on, to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty con&s;iderable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which the farmer knows, is to leave his ground fallow for a year, as &s;oon as it is ex|hau&s;ted; and the warmth of the &s;un alone and temperature of the climate enrich it, and re&s;tore its fertility. Such poor pea&s;ants, therefore, require only a &s;imple maintenance for their labour. They have no &s;tock nor riches, which claim more; and at the &s;ame time, they are for ever dependent on their landlord, who gives no lea&s;es, nor fears that his land will be &s;poil'd by the ill methods of culti|vation. In <HI>England,</HI> the land is rich, but coar&s;e; mu&s;t be cultivated at a great expence; and pro|duces &s;lender crops, when not carefully manag'd, and by a method, which gives not the full profit but in a cour&s;e of &s;everal years. A farmer, there|fore, in <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable &s;tock and a long lea&s;e; which beget proportional profits. The fine vineyards of <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Burgundy,</HI> that oft yield to the landlord above five pounds <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="24">
acre, are cultivated by pea&s;ants, who have &s;carce bread: And the rea&s;on is, that &s;uch pea&s;ants need no &s;tock but their own limbs, along with in&s;tru|ments of husbandry, which they can buy for 20 &s;hillings. The farmers are commonly in &s;ome better circum&s;tances in tho&s;e countries. But the graziers are mo&s;t at their ea&s;e of all tho&s;e, who cultivate the land. The rea&s;on is &s;till the &s;ame. Men mu&s;t have profits proportionable to their ex|pence and hazard. Where &s;o con&s;iderable a num|ber of the labouring poor as the pea&s;ants and farm|ers, are in very low circum&s;tances, all the re&s;t mu&s;t partake of their poverty, whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican.</P>
<P>WE may form a &s;imilar remark with regard to the general hi&s;tory of mankind. What is the rea|&s;on, why no people living betwixt the tropics cou'd ever yet attain to any art or civility, or reach e|ven any police in their government and any mili|tary di&s;cipline; while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether depriv'd of the&s;e ad|vantages? 'Tis probable, that one cau&s;e of this phaenomenon is the warmth and equality of wea|ther in the torrid zone, that render cloaths and hou&s;es le&s;s requi&s;ite for the inhabitants, and there|by remove, in part, that nece&s;&s;ity, which is the great &s;pur to indu&s;try and invention. <HI>Curis acuens mortalia corda.</HI> Not to mention, that the fewer goods or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this kind any people enjoy,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
the fewer quarrels are likely to ari&s;e among&s;t them; and the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity will there be for a &s;ettled po|lice or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE II. <HI>Of Luxury.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LUXURY is a word of a very uncertain &s;igni|fication, and may be taken in a good as well as a bad &s;en&s;e. In general, it means great refine|ment in the gratification of the &s;en&s;es; and any de|gree of it may be innocent or blameable, according to the age or country or condition of the per&s;on. The bounds betwixt the virtue and the vice can|not here be fixt exactly, more than in other moral &s;ubjects. To imagine, that the gratifying any of the &s;en&s;es, or the indulging any delicacy in meats, drinks, or apparel is, of it&s;elf, a vice, can never en|ter into any head, that is not di&s;order'd by the frenzies of a fanatical enthu&s;ia&s;m. I have, indeed, heard of a monk abroad, who, becau&s;e the win|dows of his cell open'd upon a very noble pro|&s;pect, made a <HI>covenant with his eyes</HI> never to turn that way, or receive &s;o &s;en&s;ual a gratification. And &s;uch is the crime of drinking <HI>Champagne</HI> or <HI>Bur|gundy,</HI> preferably to &s;mall beer or porter. The&s;e indulgences are only vices, when they are pur&s;u'd at the expence of &s;ome virtue, as liberality or cha|rity: In like manner, as they are follies, when for them a man ruins his fortune, and reduces him&s;elf to want and beggary. Where they entrench upon
<PB N="24" REF="27">
no virtue, but leave ample &s;ubject, whence to pro|vide for friends, family, and every proper object of genero&s;ity or compa&s;&s;ion, they are entirely inno|cent, and have in every age been acknowledg'd &s;uch by almo&s;t all morali&s;ts. To be entirely oc|cupy'd with the luxury of the table, for in&s;tance, without any reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of ambition, &s;tu|dy or conver&s;ation, is a mark of gro&s;s &s;tupidity, and is incompatible with any vigour of temper or ge|nius. To confine one's expence entirely to &s;uch a gratification, without regard to friends or family, is an indication of a heart entirely devoid of huma|nity or benevolence. But if a man re&s;erve time &s;ufficient for all laudable pur&s;uits, and money &s;uf|ficient for all generous purpo&s;es, he is free from e|very &s;hadow of blame or reproach.</P>
<P>SINCE luxury may be con&s;ider'd, either as in|nocent or blameable, one may be &s;urpris'd at tho&s;e prepo&s;terous opinions, which have been entertain'd concerning it; while men of libertine principles be&s;tow prai&s;es even on vitious luxury, and repre|&s;ent it as highly advantageous to &s;ociety; and on the other hand, men of &s;evere morals blame even the mo&s;t innocent luxury, and repre&s;ent it as the &s;ource of all the corruptions, di&s;orders, and facti|ons, incident to civil government. We &s;hall here endeavour to correct both the&s;e extremes, by prov|ing, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the ages of refinement and luxury are both the happie&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="28">
that wherever luxury cea&s;es to be innocent, it al&s;o cea&s;es to be beneficial, and when carry'd a degree too far, is a quality pernicious, tho' perhaps not the mo&s;t pernicious, to political &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To prove the fir&s;t point, we need but con&s;ider the effects of luxury both on <HI>private</HI> and on <HI>public</HI> life. Human happine&s;s, according to the mo&s;t re|ceiv'd notions, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in three ingredients, action, plea&s;ure, and indolence; and tho' the&s;e in|gredients ought to be mixt in different proportions, according to the particular di&s;po&s;itions of the per|&s;on, yet no one ingredient can be entirely want|ing, without de&s;troying, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the re|li&s;h of the whole compo&s;ition. Indolence or re|po&s;e, indeed, &s;eems not, of it&s;elf, to contribute much to our enjoyment; but like &s;leep, is requi&s;ite as an indulgence to the weakne&s;s of human nature, which cannot &s;upport an uninterrupted cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure. That quick march of the &s;pirits, which takes a man from him&s;elf, and chief|ly gives &s;atisfaction, does in the end exhau&s;t the mind, and requires &s;ome intervals of repo&s;e, which, tho' agreeable for a moment, yet, if prolong'd, be|get a languor and lethargy, that de&s;troy all enjoy|ment. Education, cu&s;tom, and example have a mighty influence in turning the mind to any of the&s;e pur&s;uits; and it mu&s;t be own'd, that, where they promote a reli&s;h for action and plea&s;ure, they are &s;o far favourable to human happine&s;s. In times,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
when indu&s;try and arts flouri&s;h, men are kept in perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward, the occupation it&s;elf, as well as tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which are the fruits of their labour. The mind acquires new vigour; enlarges its powers and facul|ties; and by an affiduity in hone&s;t indu&s;try, both &s;atisfies its natural appetites, and prevents the growth of unnatural ones, which commonly &s;pring up, when nouri&s;h'd with ea&s;e and idlene&s;s. Bani&s;h tho&s;e arts from &s;ociety, you deprive men both of action and of plea&s;ure; and leaving nothing but indolence in their place, you even de&s;troy the reli&s;h of indo|lence, which never is agreeable, but when it &s;uc|ceeds to labour, and recruits the &s;pirits, exhau&s;ted by too much application and fatigue.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage of indu&s;try and of refine|ments in the mechanical arts is, that they com|monly produce &s;ome refinements in the liberal arts; nor can the one be carried to perfection, without being accompany'd, in &s;ome degree, with the other. The &s;ame age, which produces great philo&s;ophers and politicians, renown'd generals and poets, u&s;u|ally abounds with &s;kilful weavers and &s;hip-carpen|ters. We cannot rea&s;onably expect, that a piece of woolen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation, that is ignorant of a&s;tronomy, or where ethics are neglected. The &s;pirit of the age affects all the arts; and the minds of men, being once rous'd from their lethargy, and put into a fermen|tation,
<PB N="27" REF="30">
turn them&s;elves on all fides, and carry im|provements into every art and &s;cience. Profound ignorance is totally bani&s;h'd, and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures, to think as well as to act, to cultivate the plea&s;ures of the mind as well as tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>THE more the&s;e refin'd arts advance, the more &s;ociable do men become; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, that, when enrich'd with &s;cience, and po&s;&s;e&s;t of a fund of conver&s;ation, they &s;hould be contented to re|main in &s;olitude, or live with their fellow citizens in that di&s;tant manner, which is peculiar to igno|rant and barbarous nations. They flock into ci|ties; love to receive and communicate knowledge; to &s;how their wit or their breeding; their ta&s;te in conver&s;ation or living, in cloaths or furniture. Cu|rio&s;ity allures the wi&s;e: Vanity the fooli&s;h: And plea&s;ure both. Particular clubs and &s;ocieties are every where form'd: Both &s;exes meet in an ea&s;y and &s;ociable manner, and mens tempers, as well as behaviour, refine a-pace. So that be&s;ide the im|provements they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t feel an increa&s;e of humanity, from the very habit of con|ver&s;ing together, and contributing to each other's plea&s;ure and entertainment. Thus <HI>indu&s;try, know|ledge,</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI> are linkt together by an indi&s;|&s;oluble chain, and are found, from experience as
<PB N="28" REF="31">
well as rea&s;on, to be peculiar to the more poli&s;h'd and luxurious ages.</P>
<P>NOR are the&s;e advantages attended with di&s;ad|vantages, that bear any proportion to them. The more men refine upon plea&s;ure, the le&s;s will they indulge in exce&s;&s;es of any kind; becau&s;e nothing is more de&s;tructive to true plea&s;ure than &s;uch exce&s;|&s;es. One may &s;afely affirm, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> are oftner guilty of bea&s;tly gluttony, when they fea&s;t on their dead hor&s;es, than <HI>European</HI> courtiers with all their refinements of cookery. And if libertine love, or even infidelity to the marriage-bed, be more fre|quent in polite ages, when it is often regarded on|ly as a piece of gallantry, drunkenne&s;s, on the other hand, is much le&s;s common: A vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body. And in this matter I would appeal not only to an <HI>Ovid</HI> or a <HI>Petronius,</HI> but to a <HI>Seneca</HI> or a <HI>Cato.</HI> We know, that <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> during <HI>Cataline</HI>'s con&s;piracy, being nece&s;&s;itated to put into <HI>Cato</HI>'s hands a <HI>billet|doux,</HI> which di&s;cover'd an intrigue with <HI>Servilia, Cato</HI>'s own &s;i&s;ter, that &s;tern philo&s;opher threw it back to him with indignation, and in the bitterne&s;s of his wrath gave him the appellation of drunkard, as a term more opprobrious than that with which he cou'd more ju&s;tly have reproach'd him.</P>
<P>BUT indu&s;try, knowledge, and humanity are not advantageous in private life alone: They diffu&s;e their beneficial influence on the <HI>Public,</HI> and render
<PB N="29" REF="32">
the government as great and flouri&s;hing as they make individuals happy and pro&s;perous. The en|crea&s;e and con&s;umption of all the commodities, which &s;erve to the ornament and plea&s;ure of life, are advantageous to &s;ociety; becau&s;e at the &s;ame time that they multiply tho&s;e innocent gratifications to individuals, they are a kind of <HI>&s;tore-hou&s;e</HI> of labour, which, in the exigencies of &s;tate, may be turn'd to the public &s;ervice. In a nation, where there is no demand for &s;uch &s;uperfluities, men &s;ink into indo|lence, lo&s;e all the enjoyment of life, and are u&s;ele&s;s to the public, which cannot maintain nor &s;upport its fleets and armies, from the indu&s;try of &s;uch &s;loth|ful members.</P>
<P>THE bounds of all the <HI>European</HI> kingdoms are, at pre&s;ent, pretty near the &s;ame they were two hundred years ago: But what a difference is there in the power and grandeur of tho&s;e king|doms? Which can be a&s;crib'd to nothing but the encrea&s;e of art and indu&s;try. When <HI>Charles</HI> the VIII. of <HI>France</HI> invaded <HI>Italy,</HI> he carry'd with him about 20,000 men: And yet this arma|ment &s;o exhau&s;ted the nation, as we learn from <HI>Guicciardin,</HI> that for &s;ome years it was not able to make &s;o great an effort. The late king of <HI>France,</HI> in time of war, kept in pay above 400,000 men;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The in&s;cription on the <HI>Place-de-Vendome</HI> &s;ays 440,000.</NOTE> tho' from <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s death to his own he was en|gag'd in a cour&s;e of wars, that la&s;ted near thirty years.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="33">
THIS indu&s;try is much promoted by the know|ledge, in&s;eparable from the ages of arts and luxury; as on the other hand, this knowledge enables the public to make the be&s;t advantage of the indu&s;try of its &s;ubjects. Laws, order, police, di&s;cipline; the&s;e can never be carry'd to any degree of perfec|tion, before human rea&s;on has refin'd it&s;elf by ex|erci&s;e, and by an application to the more vulgar arts, at lea&s;t, of commerce and manufactures. Can we expect, that a government will be well model'd by a people, who know not how to make a &s;pin|ning wheel, or to employ a loom to advantage? Not to mention, that all ignorant ages are infe&s;t|ed with &s;uper&s;tition, which throws the government off its bias, and di&s;turbs men in the pur&s;uit of their intere&s;t and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE in the arts of government natur|ally begets mildne&s;s and moderation, by in&s;truct|ing men in the advantages of humane maxims a|bove rigour and &s;everity, which drive &s;ubjects in|to rebellion, and render the return to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion impracticable, by cutting off all hopes of pardon. When mens temper is &s;often'd as well as their knowledge improv'd, this humanity appears &s;till more con&s;picuous, and is the chief characteri&s;tic, that di&s;tingui&s;hes a civiliz'd age from times of bar|barity and ignorance.

<P>NOR need we fear, that men, by lo&s;ing their ferocity, will lo&s;e their martial &s;pirit, or become le&s;s undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty. The arts have no &s;uch effect in enervating either the mind or body. On the contrary, indu&s;try, their in&s;eparable attendant, adds new force to both. And if anger, which is &s;aid to be the whet&s;tone of courage, lo&s;es &s;omewhat of its a&s;perity, by politene&s;s and refinement; a &s;en&s;e of honour, which is a &s;tronger, more con&s;tant, and more governable principle, acquires fre&s;h vigour by that elevation of genius, which ari&s;es from knowledge and a good education. Add to this, that courage can neither have any duration, nor be of any u&s;e, when not accompany'd with di&s;cip|line and martial &s;kill, which are &s;eldom found a|mong a barbarous people.

This is almo&s;t the only &s;pecies of commerce, with which that people are acquainted.</P>
<P>THE liberties of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o far from decaying &s;ince the origin of luxury and the arts, have ne|ver flouri&s;h'd &s;o much as during that period. And tho' corruption may &s;eem to encrea&s;e of late years; this is chiefly to be a&s;crib'd to our e&s;tabli&s;h'd liberty, when our princes have found the impo&s;&s;ibility of governing without parliaments, or of terrifying par|liaments by the fantom of prerogative. Not to mention, that this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more among the electors than the elect|ed; and therefore cannot ju&s;tly be a&s;crib'd to any refinements in luxury.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the matter in a proper light, we &s;hall find, that luxury and the arts are rather fa|vourable to liberty, and have a natural tendency to pre&s;erve, if not produce a free government. In
<PB N="35" REF="38">
rude unpoli&s;h'd nations, where the arts are neglect|ed, all the labour is be&s;tow'd on the cultivation of the ground; and the whole &s;ociety divides into two cla&s;&s;es, proprietors of land, and their va&s;&s;als or tenants. The latter are nece&s;&s;arily dependent and fitted for &s;lavery and &s;ubjection; e&s;pecially where they po&s;&s;e&s;s no riches, and are not valu'd for their knowledge in agriculture; as mu&s;t always be the ca&s;e where the arts are neglected. The former naturally erect them&s;elves into petty tyrants; and mu&s;t either &s;ubmit to an ab&s;olute ma&s;ter for the &s;ake of peace and order; or if they will pre&s;erve their independency, like the <HI>Gothic</HI> barons, they mu&s;t fall into feuds and conte&s;ts among&s;t them|&s;elves, and throw the whole &s;ociety into &s;uch con|fu&s;ion as is perhaps wor&s;e than the mo&s;t de&s;potic government. But where luxury nouri&s;hes com|merce and indu&s;try, the pea&s;ants, by a proper culti|vation of the land, become rich and independent; while the trade&s;men and merchants acquire a &s;hare of the property, and draw authority and con&s;ider|ation to that middling rank of men; who are the be&s;t and firme&s;t ba&s;is of public liberty. The&s;e &s;ub|mit not to &s;lavery, like the poor pea&s;ants, from po|verty and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit; and having no hopes of tyrannizing over others, like the barons, they are not tempted, for the &s;ake of that gratification, to &s;ubmit to the tyranny of their &s;overeign. They covet equal laws, which may &s;ecure their proper|ty,
<PB N="36" REF="39">
and pre&s;erve them from monarchical, as well as ari&s;tocratical tyranny.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of commons is the &s;upport of our popular government; and all the world acknow|ledge, that it ow'd its chief influence and con&s;ider|ation to the encrea&s;e of commerce, which threw &s;uch a balance of property into the hands of the commons. How incon&s;i&s;tent, then, is it to blame &s;o violently luxury, or a refinement in the arts, and to repre&s;ent it as the bane of liberty and public &s;pirit!</P>
<P>TO declaim again&s;t pre&s;ent times, and magnify the virtue of remote ance&s;tors, is a propen&s;ity al|mo&s;t inherent in human nature; and as the &s;enti|ments and opinions of civiliz'd ages alone are tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, hence it is that we meet with &s;o many &s;evere judgments pronounc'd a|gain&s;t luxury and even &s;cience, and hence it is that at pre&s;ent we give &s;o ready an a&s;&s;ent to them. But the fallacy is ea&s;ily perceiv'd from comparing dif|ferent nations that are contemporaries; where we both judge more impartially, and can better &s;et in oppo&s;ition tho&s;e manners with which we are &s;ufficiently acquainted. Treachery and cruelty, the mo&s;t pernicious and mo&s;t odious of all vi|ces, &s;eem peculiar to unciviliz'd ages; and by the refin'd <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> were a&s;crib'd to all the barbarous nations, which &s;urrounded them. They
<PB N="37" REF="40">
might ju&s;tly, therefore, have pre&s;um'd, that their own ance&s;tors, &s;o highly celebrated, po&s;&s;e&s;t no greater virtue, and were as much inferior to their po&s;terity in honour and humanity as in ta&s;te and &s;cience. An antient <HI>Frank</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> may be high|ly extoll'd: But I believe every man would think his life or fortune much le&s;s &s;ecure in the hands of a <HI>Moor</HI> or <HI>Tartar,</HI> than in tho&s;e of a <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gentleman, the rank of men the mo&s;t civiliz'd, in the mo&s;t civiliz'd nations.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> po&s;ition, which we propos'd to illu&s;trate, <HI>viz.</HI> that as innocent luxury or a refinement in plea&s;ure is advantageous to the public; &s;o wherever luxury cea&s;es to be innocent, it al&s;o cea&s;es to be beneficial, and when carry'd a degree farther, begins to be a quality pernicious, tho', perhaps, not the mo&s;t pernicious, to political &s;ociety.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider what we call vicious luxury. No gratification, however &s;en&s;ual, can, of it&s;elf, be e&s;teem'd vicious. A gratification is only vici|ous, when it engro&s;&s;es all a man's expence, and leaves no ability for &s;uch acts of duty and genero|&s;ity as are requir'd by his &s;ituation and fortune. Suppo&s;e, that he correct the vice, and employ part of his expence in the education of his children, in the &s;upport of his friends, and in relieving the poor; would any prejudice re&s;ult to &s;ociety? On the con|trary,
<PB N="38" REF="41">
the &s;ame con&s;umption would ari&s;e; and that labour, which, at pre&s;ent, is employ'd only in pro|ducing a &s;lender gratification to one man, would relieve the nece&s;&s;itous, and be&s;tow &s;atisfaction on hundreds. The &s;ame care and toil, which rai&s;e a di&s;h of peas at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> would give bread to a whole family during &s;ix months. To &s;ay, that, without a vicious luxury, the labour would not have been employ'd at all, is only to &s;ay, that there is &s;ome other defect in human nature, &s;uch as indo|lence, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, inattention to others, for which luxury, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, provides a remedy; as one poi&s;on may be an antidote to another. But virtue, like whole&s;ome food, is better than poi&s;ons, however corrected.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the &s;ame number of men, that are, at pre&s;ent, in <HI>Britain,</HI> with the &s;ame &s;oil and climate; I ask, is it not po&s;&s;ible for them to be happier, by the mo&s;t perfect way of life, that can be imagin'd, and by the greate&s;t reformation, which omnipo|tence it&s;elf could work in their temper and dispo|&s;ition? To a&s;&s;ert, that they cannot, appears evi|dently ridiculous. As the land is able to maintain more than all its inhabitants, they cou'd never, in &s;uch an <HI>Utopian</HI> &s;tate, feel any other ills, than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from bodily &s;ickne&s;s; and the&s;e are not the half of human mi&s;eries. All other ills &s;pring from &s;ome vice, either in our&s;elves or others; and even many of our di&s;ea&s;es proceed from the &s;ame
<PB N="39" REF="42">
origin. Remove the vices, and the ills follow. You mu&s;t only take care to remove all the vices. If you remove part, you may render the matter wor&s;e. By bani&s;hing <HI>vicious</HI> luxury, without cur|ing &s;loth and an indifference to others, you only dimini&s;h indu&s;try in the &s;tate, and add nothing to mens charity or their genero&s;ity. Let us, there|fore, re&s;t contented with a&s;&s;erting, that two oppo|&s;ite vices in a &s;tate may be more advantageous than either of them alone; but let us never pronounce vice, in it &s;elf, advantageous. Is it not very in|con&s;i&s;tent for an author to a&s;&s;ert in one page, that moral di&s;tinctions are inventions of politicians for public intere&s;t; and in the next page maintain, that vice is advantageous to the public?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fable of the hees.</NOTE> And in|deed, it &s;eems, upon any &s;y&s;tem of morality, little le&s;s than a contradiction in terms, to talk of a vice, that is in general beneficial to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this rea&s;oning nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give &s;ome light to a philo&s;ophical que&s;tion, which has been much di&s;puted in <HI>Britain.</HI> I call it a <HI>phi|lo&s;ophical</HI> que&s;tion, not a <HI>political</HI> one. For what|ever may be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a miracu|lous transformation of mankind, as would endow them with every &s;pecies of virtue, and free them from every vice, this concerns not the magi&s;trate, who aims only at po&s;&s;ibilities. He cannot cure e|very vice, by &s;ub&s;tituting a virtue in its place. Ve|ry
<PB N="40" REF="43">
often he can only cure one vice by another; and in that ca&s;e, he ought to prefer what is lea&s;t per|nicious to &s;ociety. Luxury, when exce&s;&s;ive, is the &s;ource of many ills; but is in general prefer|able to &s;loth and idlene&s;s, which wou'd commonly &s;ucceed in its place, and are more pernicious both to private per&s;ons and to the public. When &s;loth reigns, a mean uncultivated way of life prevails a|mong&s;t individuals, without &s;ociety, without enjoy|ment. And if the &s;overeign, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, demands the &s;ervice of his &s;ubjects, the labour of the &s;tate &s;uffices only to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;aries of life to the labourers, and can afford nothing to tho&s;e, who are employ'd in the public &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE III. <HI>Of Money.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MONEY is not, properly &s;peaking, one of the &s;ubjects of commerce; but only the in|&s;trument, which men have agreed upon to facili|tate the exchange of one commodity for another. 'Tis none of the wheels of trade: 'Tis the oil, which renders the motion of the wheels more &s;mooth and ea&s;y. If we con&s;ider any one king|dom by it&s;elf, 'tis evident, that the greater or le&s;s plenty of money is of no con&s;equence; &s;ince the prices of commodities are always proportion'd to the plenty of money, and a crown in <HI>Harry</HI> the VII's. time &s;erv'd the &s;ame purpo&s;e as a pound does at pre&s;ent. 'Tis only the <HI>public,</HI> that draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money; and that only in its wars and negociations with fo|reign &s;tates. And this is the rea&s;on, why all rich and trading countries, from <HI>Carthage</HI> to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> have employ'd mercenary troops, which they hir'd from their poorer neighbours. Were they to make u&s;e of their native &s;ubjects, they would find le&s;s advantage from their &s;uperior riches, and from their great plenty of gold and &s;ilver; &s;ince the pay of all their &s;ervants mu&s;t ri&s;e in proportion to the public opulence. Our &s;mall army in <HI>Britain</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="45">
of 20,000 men are maintain'd at as great expence as a <HI>French</HI> army thrice as numerous. The <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> fleet, during the late war, requir'd as much money to &s;upport it as all the <HI>Roman</HI> legions, which kept the whole world in &s;ubjection, during the time of the emperors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">APRIVATE &s;oldier in the <HI>Roman</HI> infantry had a denarius a day, &s;omewhat le&s;s than 8 pence. The <HI>Roman</HI> emperors had common|ly 25 legions in pay, which, allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000. <HI>Tacit. ann. lib.</HI> 4. 'Tis true, there were al&s;o auxilia|ries to the legions; but their numbers are uncertain as well as their pay. To con&s;ider only the legionaries, the pay of the private men could not exceed 1600,000 pound. Now the parliament in the la&s;t war commonly allow'd for the fleet 2500,000. We have therefore 900,000 over for the officers and other expences of the <HI>Roman</HI> le|gions. There &s;eem to have been but few officers in the <HI>Roman</HI> ar|mies, in compari&s;on of what are employ'd in all our modern troops, except &s;ome <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> corps: And the&s;e officers had very &s;mall pay: A centurion, for in&s;tance, only double a common &s;oldier. And as the &s;oldiers from their pay <HI>(Tacit. ann. lib.</HI> 1.) bought their own cloaths, arms, tents and baggage; this mu&s;t al&s;o dimini&s;h con&s;ider|ably the other charges of the army. So little expen&s;ive was that mighty government, and &s;o ea&s;y was its yoke over the world. And indeed, this is the more natural conclu&s;ion from the forego|ing calculations. For money, after the conque&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;eems to have been nearly in as great plenty at <HI>Rome,</HI> as it is at pre&s;ent in the riche&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> kingdoms.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE greater number of people and their great|er indu&s;try are &s;erviceable in all ca&s;es; at home and abroad, in private and in public. But the greater plenty of money is very limited in its u&s;e, and may even &s;ometimes be a lo&s;s to a nation in its com|merce with foreigners.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">
THERE &s;eems to be a happy concurrence of cau&s;es in human affairs, which check the growth of trade and riches, and hinder them from being confin'd entirely to one people; as might natural|ly at fir&s;t be dreaded from the advantages of an e|&s;tabli&s;h'd commerce. Where one nation has got the &s;tart of another in trade, 'tis very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lo&s;t; becau&s;e of the &s;uperior indu&s;try and skill of the former, and the greater &s;tocks, which its merchants are po&s;&s;e&s;t' of, and which enable them to trade for &s;o much &s;maller profits. But the&s;e advantages are compen|&s;ated, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the low prices of labour in every nation, that has not an exten&s;ive com|merce, and does not very much abound in gold and &s;ilver. Manufactures, therefore, gradually &s;hift their places, leaving tho&s;e countries and provinces, which they have already enrich'd, and flying to o|thers, whither they are allur'd by the cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions and labour; till they have enrich'd the&s;e al&s;o, and are again bani&s;h'd by the &s;ame cau&s;es. And in general, we may ob&s;erve, that the dearne&s;s of every thing, from plenty of money, is a di&s;ad|vantage, that attends an e&s;tabli&s;h'd commerce, and &s;ets bounds to it in every country, by enabling the poorer &s;tates to under&s;ell the richer in all foreign markets.</P>
<P>THIS has made me entertain a great doubt con|cerning the benefit of <HI>banks</HI> and <HI>paper credit,</HI> which
<PB N="44" REF="47">
are &s;o generally e&s;teem'd advantageous to every nation. That provi&s;ions and labour &s;hou'd become dear by the encrea&s;e of trade and money, is, in many re&s;pects, an inconvenience; but an inconve|nience that is unavoidable, and the effect of that public wealth and pro&s;perity, which are the end of all our wi&s;hes. 'Tis compen&s;ated by the advan|tages we reap from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e precious metals, and the weight which they give the nati|on in all foreign wars and negotiations. But there appears no rea&s;on for encrea&s;ing that inconveni|ence by a counterfeit money, which foreigners will never accept of, and which any great di&s;order in the &s;tate will reduce to nothing. There are, 'tis true, many people in every rich &s;tate, who, hav|ing large &s;ums of money, wou'd prefer paper with good &s;ecurity; as being of more ea&s;y tran&s;port and more &s;afe cu&s;tody. If the public provide not a bank, private bankers will take advantage of this circum&s;tance; as the gold&s;miths formerly did in <HI>London,</HI> or as the bankers do at pre&s;ent in <HI>Dublin:</HI> And therefore 'tis better, it may be thought, that a public company &s;hould enjoy the benefit of that paper credit, which always will have place in every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour artificially to encrea&s;e &s;uch a credit, can never be the intere&s;t of any trading nation; but mu&s;t lay them under di&s;advantages, by encrea&s;ing money beyond its na|tural proportion to labour and commodities, and thereby heightening their price to the merchant
<PB N="45" REF="48">
and manufacturer. And in this view, it mu&s;t be allow'd, that no bank cou'd be more advantageous than &s;uch a one as lockt up all the money it re|ceiv'd, and never augmented the circulating coin, as is u&s;ual, by returning part of its trea&s;ure into com|merce. A public bank, by this expedient, might cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and mo|ney jobbers; and tho' the &s;tate bore the charge of &s;alaries to the directors and tellers of this bank, (for according to the preceeding &s;uppo&s;ition, it would have no profit from its dealings) the nation|al advantage, re&s;ulting from the low price of la|bour and the de&s;truction of paper credit, would be a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation. Not to mention, that &s;o large a &s;um, lying ready at command, would be a great convenience in times of public danger and di&s;tre&s;s; and might be replac'd at lei&s;ure, when peace and tranquillity were re&s;tor'd to the nation.</P>
<P>BUT of this &s;ubject of paper credit, we &s;hall treat more largely hereafter. And I &s;hall fini&s;h this e&s;&s;ay of money, by propo&s;ing and explaining two ob&s;ervations, which may, perhaps, &s;erve to employ the thought of our &s;peculative politicians. For to the&s;e only I all along addre&s;s my&s;elf.

But not|with&s;tanding this conclu&s;ion, which mu&s;t be allow|ed ju&s;t, 'tis certain, that &s;ince the di&s;cover of the mines in <HI>America,</HI> indu&s;try has encreas'd in all the nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> except in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e mines; and this may ju&s;tly be a&s;crib'd, among&s;t o|ther rea&s;ons, to the encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver. Ac|cordingly we find, that in every kingdom, into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than for|merly, every thing takes a new face; labour and
<PB N="47" REF="50">
indu&s;try gain life; the merchant becomes more en|terprizing; the manufacturer more diligent and &s;killful; and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention. This is not ea&s;ily to be accounted for, if we con&s;ider only the influence, which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom it&s;elf, by heightening the price of commodities, and obliging every one to pay a great|er number of the&s;e little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purcha&s;es. And as to foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty of money is rather di&s;advantageous, by rai&s;ing the price of every kind of labour.</P>
<P>To account, then, for this phaenomenon, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that tho' the high price of commo|dities be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver, yet it follows not immediately upon that encrea&s;e; but &s;ome time is requir'd before the money circulate thro' the whole &s;tate, and make its effects be felt on all ranks of people. At fir&s;t, no alteration is perceiv'd; by degrees, it rai&s;es the price fir&s;t of one commodity, then of another; till the whole at la&s;t ri&s;es to a ju&s;t proportion, with the new quantity of &s;pecie, which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, 'tis only in this interval or interme|diate &s;ituation, betwixt the acqui&s;ition of money and ri&s;e of prices, that the encrea&s;ing quantity of gold and &s;ilver is favourable to indu&s;try. When any quantity of money is imported into a nation, it is
<PB N="48" REF="51">
not at fir&s;t di&s;per&s;t into many hands; but is confin'd to the coffers of a few per&s;ons, who immediately &s;eek to employ it to the be&s;t advantage. Here are a &s;et of manufacturers or merchants, we &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e, who have receiv'd returns of gold and &s;ilver for goods, which they &s;ent to <HI>Cadiz.</HI> They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly, who never dream of demanding higher wages, but are glad of employment from &s;uch good payma&s;ters. If workmen become &s;carce, the manufacturer gives higher wages; but at fir&s;t re|quires an encrea&s;e of labour, and this is willingly &s;ubmitted to by the artizan, who can now eat and drink better to compen&s;ate his additional toil and fatigue. He carries his money to market, where he finds every thing at the &s;ame price as formerly, but returns with greater quantity and of better kinds, for the u&s;e of his family. The farmer and gardener, finding that all their commodities are taken off, apply them&s;elves with alacrity to the rai&s;ing of more; and at the &s;ame time, can afford to take better and more cloaths from their trade&s;|men, who&s;e price is the &s;ame as formerly, and their indu&s;try only whetted by &s;o much new gain. 'Tis ea&s;y to trace the money in its progre&s;s thro' the whole commonwealth; where we &s;hall find, that it mu&s;t fir&s;t quicken the diligence of every indivi|dual, before it encrea&s;e the price of labour.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
AND that the &s;pecie may encrea&s;e to a con&s;ider|able pitch, before it have this latter effect, appears, among&s;t other rea&s;ons, from the frequent operations of the <HI>French</HI> king on the money; where it was al|ways found, that the augmenting the numerary va|lue did not produce a proportional ri&s;e of the prices, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. In the la&s;t year of <HI>Louis</HI> the XIV. money was rais'd three &s;evenths, but prices augmented only one. Corn in <HI>France</HI> is now &s;old at the &s;ame price, or for the &s;ame number of livres, it was in 1683, tho' &s;ilver was then at 30 livres the mark, and is now at 50.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THESE facts I give upon the authority of <HI>Mon&s;. de Tot</HI> in his <HI>Reflections politiques,</HI> an author of reputation.

However, the general ob&s;ervation, that the augmenting the mo|ney in <HI>France</HI> does not at fir&s;t proportionably augment the prices, is certainly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>By the bye, this &s;eems to be one of the be&s;t rea&s;ons for a gradu|al and univer&s;al augmentation of the money, which can be given, tho' it has been entirely overlook'd in all tho&s;e volumes, which have been wrote on that que&s;tion by <HI>Melon, Du Tot,</HI> and <HI>Paris de Verney.</HI> Were all our money, for in&s;tance, recoin'd, and a penny's worth of &s;ilver taken from every &s;hilling, the new &s;hil|ling wou'd probably purcha&s;e every thing that cou'd have been bought by the old; the prices of every thing wou'd thereby be in|&s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;h'd; foreign trade enliven'd; and dome&s;tic indu&s;|try, by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and &s;hillings, wou'd receive &s;ome encrea&s;e and encouragement. In executing &s;uch a project, 'twou'd be better to make the new &s;hilling pa&s;s for 24 half-pence, in order to pre&s;erve the illu&s;ion, and make it be ta|ken for the &s;ame.</P></NOTE> Not to mention, the
<PB N="50" REF="53">
great addition of gold and &s;ilver, which may have come into that kingdom, &s;ince the former period.</P>
<P>FROM the whole of this rea&s;oning we may con|clude, that 'tis of no manner of con&s;equence, with regard to the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of a &s;tate, whe|ther money be in a greater or le&s;s quantity. The good policy of the magi&s;trate con&s;i&s;ts only in keep|ing it, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till encrea&s;ing; becau&s;e, by that means, he keeps a &s;pirit of indu&s;try alive in the na|tion, and encrea&s;es the &s;tock of labour, wherein con&s;i&s;ts all real power and riches. A nation, who&s;e money decrea&s;es, is actually, at that time, much weaker and more mi&s;erable, than another nation, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no more money, but is on the en|crea&s;ing hand. This will be ea&s;ily accounted for, if we con&s;ider, that the alterations in the quantity of money, either on the one &s;ide or the other, are not immediately attended with proportionable alte|rations in the prices of commodities. There is al|ways an interval before matters be adju&s;ted to their new &s;ituation; and this interval is as pernicious to indu&s;try, when gold and &s;ilver are dimini&s;hing, as it is advantageous, when the&s;e metals are encrea&s;ing. The workman has not the &s;ame employment from the manufacturer and merchant; tho' he pays the &s;ame price for every thing in the market. The farmer cannot di&s;po&s;e of his corn and cattle; tho' he mu&s;t pay the &s;ame rent to his landlord. The
<PB N="51" REF="54">
poverty and beggary and &s;loth, which mu&s;t en&s;ue, are ea&s;ily fore&s;een.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> ob&s;ervation I propos'd to make with regard to money, may be explain'd after the following manner. There are &s;ome kingdoms, and many provinces in <HI>Europe,</HI> (and all of them were once in the &s;ame condition) where money is &s;o &s;carce, that the landlord can get none at all from his tenants; but is oblig'd to take his rent in kind, and either to con&s;ume it him&s;elf, or tran&s;port it to pla|ces, where he may find a market. In tho&s;e coun|tries, the prince can levy few or no taxes, but in the &s;ame manner: And as he will receive very &s;mall benefit from impo&s;itions &s;o pay'd, 'tis evi|dent, that &s;uch a kingdom has very little force e|ven at home; and cannot maintain fleets and ar|mies to the &s;ame extent, as if every part of it a|bounded in gold and &s;ilver. There is &s;urely a greater di&s;proportion betwixt the force of <HI>Germany</HI> at pre&s;ent and what it was three centuries ago,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE <HI>Italians</HI> gave to the emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the nick|name of <HI>Pocchi-danari.</HI> None of the enterpri&s;es of that prince e|ver &s;ucceeded, for want of money.</NOTE> than there is in its indu&s;try, people and manfac|tures. The <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well cultivated, and are of great extent, but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of <HI>Europe;</HI> proceeding, as is commonly &s;uppos'd, from their &s;carcity of money. How do all the&s;e facts agree with that principle of
<PB N="52" REF="55">
rea&s;on, that the quantity of gold and &s;ilver is in it|&s;elf altogether indifferent? According to that prin|ciple, wherever a &s;overeign has numbers of &s;ub|jects, and the&s;e have plenty of commodities, he &s;hou'd, of cour&s;e, be great and powerful, and they rich and happy, independent of the greater or le&s;|&s;er abundance of the precious metals. The&s;e ad|mit of divi&s;ions and &s;ub-divi&s;ions to a great extent; and where they wou'd become &s;o &s;mall as to be in danger of being lo&s;t, 'tis ea&s;y to mix them with a ba&s;er metal, as is practis'd in &s;ome countries of <HI>Europe;</HI> and by that means rai&s;e them to a bulk more &s;en&s;ible and convenient. They &s;till &s;erve the &s;ame purpo&s;es of exchange, whatever their num|ber may be, or whatever colour they may be &s;up|pos'd to have.</P>
<P>To the&s;e difficulties I an&s;wer, that the effect, here &s;uppos'd to flow from &s;carcity of money, re|ally ari&s;es from the manners and cu&s;toms of the in|habitants, and that we mi&s;take, as is u&s;ual, a col|lateral effect for a cau&s;e. The contradiction is only apparent; but it requires &s;ome thought and reflection to di&s;cover the principles, by which we can reconcile <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to <HI>experience.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems a maxim almo&s;t &s;elf-evident, that the prices of every thing depend on the proportion be|twixt commodities and money, and that any con|&s;iderable alteration on either of the&s;e has the &s;ame
<PB N="53" REF="56">
effect either of heightening or dimini&s;hing the price. Encrea&s;e the commodities, they become cheaper: Encrea&s;e the money, they ri&s;e in their value. As on the other hand, a diminution of the former, and that of the latter have contrary tendencies.</P>
<P>'TIS al&s;o evident, that the prices do not &s;o much depend on the ab&s;olute quantity of commodities and of money, which are in a nation; as on that of the commodities, which come or may come to market, and of the money, which circulates. If the coin be lockt up in che&s;ts, 'tis the &s;ame thing with regard to prices, as if it were annihilated: If the commodities be hoarded in granaries, a like effect follows. As the money and commodities, in the&s;e ca&s;es, never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were we, at any time, to form con|jectures concerning the prices of provi&s;ions, the corn, which the farmer mu&s;t re&s;erve for the main|tenance of him&s;elf and family, ought never to en|ter into the e&s;timation. 'Tis only the overplus, compar'd to the demand, that determines the value.</P>
<P>To apply the&s;e principles, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that in the fir&s;t and more uncultivated ages of a|ny &s;tate, e're fancy has confounded her wants with tho&s;e of nature, men, contented with the produc|tions of their own fields, or with tho&s;e rude prepa|rations, which they them&s;elves can work upon
<PB N="54" REF="57">
them, have little occa&s;ion for exchange, or at lea&s;t for money, which, by agreement, is the common mea&s;ure of exchange. The wool of the farmer's own flock, &s;pun in his own family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who receives his pay|ment in corn or wool, &s;uffices for furniture and cloathing. The carpenter, the &s;mith, the ma&s;on, the taylor are retain'd by wages of a like nature; and the landlord him&s;elf, dwelling in the neigh|bourhood, is contented to receive his rent in the commodities rais'd by the farmer. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e he con&s;umes at home, in ru&s;tic ho|&s;pitality: The re&s;t, perhaps, he di&s;po&s;es of for mo|ney to the neighbouring town, whence he draws the materials of his expence and luxury.</P>
<P>BUT after men begin to refine on all the&s;e en|joyments, and live not always at home, nor are contented with what can be rais'd in their neigh|bourhood, there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds, and more money enters into that ex|change. The trade&s;men will not be paid in corn; becau&s;e they want &s;omething more than barely to eat. The farmer goes beyond his own pari&s;h for the commodities he purcha&s;es, and cannot always carry his commodities to the merchant, who &s;up|plies him. The landlord lives in the capital or in a foreign country; and demands his rent in gold and &s;ilver, which can ea&s;ily be tran&s;ported to him. Great undertakers and manufacturers and mer|chants
<PB N="55" REF="58">
ari&s;e in every commodity; and the&s;e can conveniently deal in nothing but in &s;pecie. And con&s;equently, in this &s;ituation of &s;ociety, the coin enters into many more contracts, and by that means is much more employ'd than in the former.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary effect is, that provided the mo|ney does not encrea&s;e in the nation, every thing mu&s;t become much cheaper in times of indu&s;try and refinement, than in rude, uncultivated ages. 'Tis the proportion betwixt the money, that cir|culates, and the commodities in the market, that determines the prices. Goods, that are con&s;um'd at home, or exchang'd with other goods in the neighbourhood, never come to market; they af|fect not, in the lea&s;t, the current &s;pecie; with re|gard to it they are as if totally annihilated; and con&s;equently this method of u&s;ing them &s;inks the proportion on the &s;ide of the commodities, and en|crea&s;es the prices. But after money enters into all contracts and &s;ales, and is every where the mea&s;ure of exchange, the &s;ame national ca&s;h has a much greater task to perform; all commodities are then in the market; the &s;phere of circulation is enlarg'd; 'tis the &s;ame ca&s;e as if that individual &s;um were to &s;erve a larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion being here dimini&s;h'd on the &s;ide of the money, every thing mu&s;t become cheaper, and the prices gradually fall.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="59">
BY the mo&s;t exact computations, that have been form'd all over <HI>Europe,</HI> after making allowance for the change in the numerary value or the deno|mination, 'tis found, that the prices of all things have only ri&s;en three, or at mo&s;t four times &s;ince the di&s;covery of the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> But will any one a&s;&s;ert, that there is no more than four times the coin in <HI>Europe,</HI> that was in the fifteenth cen|tury and the centuries preceding it? The <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> from their mines, the <HI>En|gli&s;h, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> by their <HI>African</HI> trade, and by their interlopers in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> bring home about &s;even millions a year, of which not a|bove a tenth part goes to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> This &s;um alone in five years would probably double the antient &s;tock of money in <HI>Europe.</HI> And no other &s;atisfactory rea&s;on can be given, why all prices have not ri&s;en to a much more exorbitant height, except that deriv'd from a change of cu&s;toms and manners. Be&s;ides, that more commodities are produc'd by additional indu&s;try, the &s;ame commo|dities come more to market, after men depart from their antient &s;implicity of manners. And tho' this encrea&s;e has not been equal to that of mo|ney, it has, however, been con&s;iderable, and has pre&s;erv'd the proportion betwixt coin and commo|dities nearer the antient &s;tandard.</P>
<P>WERE the que&s;tion propos'd, which of the&s;e methods of living in the people, the &s;imple or the
<PB N="57" REF="60">
refin'd, is the mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;tate or pub|lic, I &s;hou'd, without much &s;cruple, prefer the latter, in a view to politics at lea&s;t; and &s;hould produce this as an additional rea&s;on for the encou|ragement of trade and manufactures.</P>
<P>WHEN men live in the antient &s;imple manner, and &s;upply all their nece&s;&s;ities from their dome&s;tic indu&s;try or from the neighbourhood, the &s;overeign can levy no taxes in money from a con&s;iderable part of his &s;ubjects; and if he will impo&s;e on them any burthens, he mu&s;t take his payment in commodities, with which alone they abound; a method attended with &s;uch great and obvious in|conveniencies, that they need not here be in&s;i&s;ted on. All the money he can pretend to rai&s;e mu&s;t be from his principal cities, where alone it circu|lates; and the&s;e, 'tis evident, cannot afford him &s;o much as the whole &s;tate cou'd, did gold and &s;il|ver circulate thro' the whole. But be&s;ides this obvious diminution of the revenue, there is al&s;o another cau&s;e of the poverty of the public in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Not only the &s;overeign receives le&s;s money, but the &s;ame money goes not &s;o far as in times of indu&s;try and general commerce. Every thing is dearer, where the gold and &s;ilver are &s;up|pos'd equal; and that becau&s;e fewer commodities come to market, and the whole coin bears a high|er proportion to what is to be purchas'd by it;
<PB N="58" REF="61">
whence alone the prices of every thing are fix'd and determin'd.</P>
<P>HERE then we may learn the fallacy of the re|mark, often to be met with in hi&s;torians, and even in common conver&s;ation, that any particular &s;tate is weak, tho' fertile, populous, and well cultivat|ed, merely becau&s;e it wants money. It appears, that the want of money can never injure any &s;tate within it&s;elf: For men and commodities are the real &s;trength of any community. 'Tis the &s;imple manner of living which here hurts the public, by confining the gold and &s;ilver to few hands, and preventing its univer&s;al diffu&s;ion and circulation. On the contrary, indu&s;try and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole &s;tate, however &s;mall its quantity may be: They dige&s;t it into e|very vein, &s;o to &s;peak; and make it enter into e|very tran&s;action and contract. No hand is entire|ly empty of it; and as the prices of every thing fall by that means, the &s;overeign has a double advan|tage: He may draw money by his taxes from every part of the &s;tate, and what he receives goes farther in every purcha&s;e and payment.</P>
<P>WE may infer, from a compari&s;on of prices, that money is not more plentiful in <HI>China,</HI> than it was in <HI>Europe</HI> three centuries ago: But what im|men&s;e power is that empire po&s;&s;e&s;t of, if we may judge by the civil and military li&s;t, maintain'd by
<PB N="59" REF="62">
it? <HI>Polybius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 15.</NOTE> tells us, that provi&s;ions were &s;o cheap in <HI>Italy</HI> during his time, that in &s;ome places the &s;tated club in the inns was a <HI>&s;emis</HI> a head, little more than a farthing: Yet the <HI>Roman</HI> power had even then &s;ubdu'd the whole known world. A|bout a century before that period, the <HI>Carthagini|an</HI> amba&s;&s;adors &s;aid, by way of raillery, that no people liv'd more &s;ociably among&s;t them&s;elves than the <HI>Romans;</HI> for that in every entertainment, which, as foreign mini&s;ters, they receiv'd, they &s;till ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame plate at every table.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> lib. 33. cap. 11.</NOTE> The ab&s;olute quantity of the precious metals is a mat|ter of great indifference.

<P>IN the following di&s;cour&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee an in|&s;tance of a like fallacy, as that above mention'd; where a collateral effect is taken for a cau&s;e, and where a con&s;equence is a&s;crib'd to the plenty of money; tho' it be really owing to a change in the manners and cu&s;toms of the people.</P>

<P>NOTHING is e&s;teem'd a more certain &s;ign of the flouri&s;hing condition of any nation than the lowne&s;s of intere&s;t: And with rea&s;on; tho' I believe the cau&s;e is &s;omewhat different from what is commonly apprehended. The lowne&s;s of intere&s;t is generally a&s;crib'd to the plenty of money. But money, however plentiful, has no other ef|fect, <HI>if fixt,</HI> than to rai&s;e the price of labour. Sil|ver is more common than gold; and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the &s;ame com|modities: But do you pay le&s;s intere&s;t for it? In|tere&s;t in <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> is at 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> at 6; tho' the&s;e places, as we may learn from the prices of every thing, abound much more in gold and &s;ilver than either <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI></P>
<P>WERE all the gold in <HI>England</HI> annihilated at once, and one and twenty &s;hillings &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of every guinea, wou'd money be more plentiful or intere&s;t lower? No &s;urely: We &s;hou'd only u&s;e &s;ilver in&s;tead of gold. Were gold ren|der'd as common as &s;ilver, and &s;ilver as common as copper; would money be more plentiful or in|tere&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="64">
lower? We may a&s;&s;uredly give the &s;ame an|&s;wer. Our &s;hillings would then be yellow, and our half-pence white; and we &s;hou'd have no guineas. No other difference wou'd ever be ob&s;erv'd. No alteration on commerce, manufactures, navigation, or intere&s;t; unle&s;s we imagine, that the colour of the metal is of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>NOW what is &s;o vi&s;ible in the&s;e greater variations of &s;carcity or abundance of the precious metals, mu&s;t hold in all inferior changes. If the multiply|ing gold and &s;ilver fifteen times makes no diffe|rence, much le&s;s can the doubling or tripling them. All augmentation has no other effect than to heigh|ten the price of labour and commodities; and e|ven this variation is little more than that of a name. In the progre&s;s towards the&s;e changes, the aug|mentation may have &s;ome influence, by exciting indu&s;try; but after the prices are &s;ettled, &s;uitable to the new abundance of gold and &s;ilver, it has no manner of influence.</P>
<P>AN effect always holds proportion with its cau&s;e. Prices have ri&s;en about four times, &s;ince the di&s;|covery of the <HI>Indies;</HI> and 'tis probable gold and &s;ilver have multiply'd much more: But intere&s;t has not fallen much above half. The rate of intere&s;t, therefore, is not deriv'd from the quantity of the precious metals.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">
MONEY having merely a fictitious value, ari&s;|ing from the agreement and convention of men, the greater or le&s;s plenty of it is of no con&s;equence, if we con&s;ider a nation within it&s;elf; and when once fixt, tho' in never &s;o great abundance, it has no other effect, than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of tho&s;e &s;hining bits of me|tal, for cloaths, furniture, or equipage, without en|crea&s;ing any one convenience of life. If a man borrows money to build a hou&s;e, he then carries home a greater load; becau&s;e the &s;tone, timber, lead, gla&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the labour of the ma&s;ons and carpenters, are repre&s;ented by a greater quantity of gold and &s;ilver.

HIGH intere&s;t ari&s;es from <HI>three</HI> circum&s;tances: A great demand for borrowing; little riches to &s;upply that demand; and great profits ari&s;ing from commerce: And the&s;e circum&s;tances are a clear proof of the &s;mall advance of commerce and in|du&s;try, not of the &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver. Low intere&s;t, on the other hand, proceeds from the three oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances: A &s;mall demand for borrowing; great riches to &s;upply that demand; and &s;mall profits ari&s;ing from commerce: And the&s;e circum&s;tances are all connected together, and proceed from the encrea&s;e of indu&s;try and com|merce, not of gold and &s;ilver. We &s;hall endea|vour to prove the&s;e points as fully and di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;hall begin with the cau&s;es and the effects of a great or &s;mall demand for borrowing.</P>
<P>WHEN a people have emerg'd ever &s;o little from a &s;tate of barbarity, and their numbers have en|creas'd beyond the original multitude, there mu&s;t immediately ari&s;e an inequality of property; and while &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;s large tracts of land, others are confin'd within narrow limits, and &s;ome are en|tirely without any landed property. Tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;s more land than they can labour, employ tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s none, and agree to receive a de|terminate part of the product. Thus the <HI>landed</HI> intere&s;t is immediately e&s;tabli&s;h'd; nor is there any &s;ettled government, however rude, wherein
<PB N="65" REF="67">
affairs are not on this footing. Of the&s;e proprie|tors of land, &s;ome mu&s;t pre&s;ently di&s;cover them|&s;elves to be of different tempers from others; and while one wou'd willingly &s;tore up the product of his land for futurity, another de&s;ires to con&s;ume at pre&s;ent what &s;hou'd &s;uffice for many years. But as the &s;pending a &s;ettled revenue is a way of life en|tirely without occupation; men have &s;o much need of &s;omewhat to fix and engage them, that plea&s;ures, &s;uch as they are, will be the pur&s;uit of the greate&s;t part of the landholders, and the prodigals among&s;t them will always be more numerous than the mi|&s;ers. In a &s;tate, therefore, where there is nothing but a landed intere&s;t, as there is little frugality, the borrowers mu&s;t be very numerous, and the rate of intere&s;t mu&s;t hold proportion to it. The difference depends not on the quantity of money, but on the habits and manners which prevail. By this alone the demand for borrowing is encreas'd or dimini&s;h'd. Were money &s;o plentiful as to make an egg be &s;old for &s;ix-pence; as long as there are only land|ed gentry and pea&s;ants in the &s;tate, the borrowers mu&s;t be numerous, and intere&s;t high. The rent for the &s;ame farm wou'd be heavier and more bul|ky: But the &s;ame idlene&s;s of the landlord, with the higher prices of commodities, wou'd di&s;&s;ipate it in the &s;ame time, and produce the &s;ame nece&s;&s;i|ty and demand for borrowing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I HAVE been inform'd by a very eminent lawyer and a man of great knowledge and ob&s;ervation, that it appears from antient papers and records, that, about four centuries ago, money, in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and probably in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> was only at five <HI>per cent.</HI> and afterwards ro&s;e to ten before the di&s;covery of the <HI>We&s;t In|dies.</HI> This fact is curious; but might ea&s;ily be reconcil'd to the foregoing rea&s;oning. Men, in that age, liv'd &s;o much at home, and in &s;o very &s;imple and frugal a manner, that they had no occa&s;ion for money; and tho' the lenders were then few, the borrowers were &s;till fewer. The high rate of intere&s;t among the early <HI>Romans</HI> is accounted for by hi&s;torians from the frequent lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tain'd by the inroads of the enemy.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">
NOR is the ca&s;e different with regard to the <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> circum&s;tance we propos'd to con&s;ider, <HI>viz.</HI> the great or little riches to &s;upply this demand. This effect al&s;o depends on the habits and ways of living of the people, not on the quantity of gold and &s;ilver. In order to have, in any &s;tate, a great number of lenders, 'tis not &s;ufficient nor requi&s;ite, that there be great abundance of the precious me|tals. 'Tis only requi&s;ite, that the property or com|mand of that quantity, which is in the &s;tate, whe|ther great or &s;mall, &s;hould be collected in particu|lar hands, &s;o as to form con&s;iderable &s;ums, or com|po&s;e a great money'd intere&s;t. This begets a num|ber of lenders, and &s;inks the rate of u&s;ury; and this, I &s;hall venture to affirm, depends not on the quan|tity of &s;pecie, but on particular manners and cu&s;|toms, which make the &s;pecie gather into &s;eparate &s;ums or ma&s;&s;es of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>FOR &s;uppo&s;e, that, by miracle, every man in <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hou'd have five pounds &s;lipt into his poc|ket in one night; this wou'd much more than
<PB N="67" REF="69">
double the whole money that is at pre&s;ent in the kingdom, and yet there would not next day, nor for &s;ome time, be any more lenders, nor any vari|ation on the intere&s;t. And were there nothing but landlords and pea&s;ants in the &s;tate, this money, however abundant, cou'd never gather into &s;ums, and wou'd only &s;erve to encrea&s;e the prices of e|very thing, without any farther con&s;equence. The prodigal landlord di&s;&s;ipates it, as fa&s;t as he receives it; and the beggarly pea&s;ant has no means nor view nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood. The overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing &s;till the &s;ame, there will follow no re|duction of intere&s;t. That depends upon another principle, and mu&s;t proceed from an encrea&s;e of in|du&s;try and frugality, of arts and commerce.</P>
<P>EVERY thing, u&s;eful to the life of man, ari&s;es from the ground; but few things ari&s;e in that con|dition, which is requi&s;ite to render them u&s;eful. There mu&s;t, therefore, be&s;ide the pea&s;ants and the proprietors of land, be another rank of men, who, receiving from the former the rude materials, work them into their proper form, and retain part for their own u&s;e and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the infancy of &s;ociety, the&s;e contracts betwixt the artizans and the pea&s;ants, and betwixt one &s;pecies of artizan and another, are commonly enter'd into immediately, by the per&s;ons them&s;elves, who, being neighbours, are readily acquainted with each other's nece&s;&s;ities,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
and can lend their mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upply them. But when mens indu&s;try encrea&s;es, and their views enlarge; 'tis found, that the mo&s;t remote parts of the &s;tate can a&s;&s;i&s;t each other as well as the more contiguous, and that this intercour&s;e of good offi|ces may be carry'd on to the greate&s;t extent and intricacy. Hence the origin of <HI>merchants,</HI> the mo&s;t u&s;eful race of men in the whole &s;ociety, who &s;erve as agents betwixt tho&s;e parts of the &s;tate, that are wholly unacquainted, and are ignorant of each o|ther's nece&s;&s;ities. Here are in a city fifty workmen in &s;ilk and linen and a thou&s;and cu&s;tomers; and the&s;e two ranks of men, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to each other, can never rightly meet, 'till one man erects a &s;hop, to which all the workmen, and all the cu&s;tomers repair. In this province, gra&s;s ri&s;es in abundance: The inhabitants abound in chee&s;e and butter and cattle; but want bread and corn, which, in a neighbour|ing province, are in too great abundance for the u&s;es of the inhabitants. One man di&s;covers this. He brings corn from the one province, and returns with cattle; and &s;upplying the wants of both, he is, &s;o far, a common benefactor. As the people en|crea&s;e in numbers and indu&s;try, the difficulty of their mutual intercour&s;e encrea&s;es: The bu&s;ine&s;s of the agency or merchandize becomes more intri|cate; and divides, &s;ub-divides, compounds, and mixes to a greater variety. In all the&s;e tran&s;acti|ons, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary and rea&s;onable, that a con&s;ider|able part of the commodities and labour &s;hou'd be|long
<PB N="69" REF="71">
to the merchant, to whom, in a great mea|&s;ure, they are owing. And the&s;e commodities he will &s;ometimes pre&s;erve in kind, or more common|ly convert into money, which is their common re|pre&s;entation. If gold and &s;ilver have encreas'd in the &s;tate along with indu&s;try, it will require a great quantity of the&s;e metals to repre&s;ent a great quan|tity of commodities and labour. If indu&s;try alone has encreas'd, the prices of every thing mu&s;t &s;ink, and a very &s;mall quantity of &s;pecie will &s;erve as a repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>THERE is no craving or demand of the human mind more con&s;tant and in&s;atiable than that for ex|erci&s;e and employment; and this de&s;ire &s;eems the foundation of mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions and pur&s;uits. Deprive a man of all bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;erious occupa|tion, he runs re&s;tle&s;s from one amu&s;ement to ano|ther; and the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion, which he feels from idlene&s;s, is &s;o great, that he forgets the ruin, which mu&s;t follow from his immoderate ex|pences. Give him a more harmle&s;s way of em|ploying his mind or body, he is &s;atisfied, and feels no longer that in&s;atiable thir&s;t after plea&s;ure. But if the employment you give him be profitable, e|&s;pecially if the profit be attach'd to every particular exertion of indu&s;try, he has gain &s;o often in his eye, that he acquires, by degrees, a pa&s;&s;ion for it, and knows no &s;uch plea&s;ure as that of &s;eeing the daily encrea&s;e of his fortune. And this is the rea&s;on why
<PB N="70" REF="72">
trade encrea&s;es frugality, and why, among mer|chants, there is the &s;ame overplus of mi&s;ers above prodigals, as, among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land, there is the contrary.</P>
<P>COMMERCE encrea&s;es indu&s;try, by conveying it readily from one member of the &s;tate to another, and allowing none of it to peri&s;h or become u&s;ele&s;s. It encrea&s;es frugality, by giving occupation to men, and employing them in the arts of gain, which &s;oon engage their affection, and remove them from all reli&s;h of plea&s;ure and expence. 'Tis an infallible con&s;equence of all indu&s;trious profe&s;&s;ions to beget frugality, and make the love of gain prevail over the love of plea&s;ure. Among lawyers and phy&s;i|cians, who have any practice, there are many more, who live within their income, than who exceed it, or even live up to it. But lawyers and phy&s;ici|ans beget no indu&s;try; and 'tis even at the expence of others they acquire their riches; &s;o that they are &s;ure to dimini&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;ome of their fel|low citizens as fa&s;t as they encrea&s;e their own. Merchants, on the contrary, beget indu&s;try, by &s;erving as canals to convey it thro' every corner of the &s;tate; and, at the &s;ame time, by their frugality, they acquire great power over that in|du&s;try, and collect a large property in the labour and commodities, which they are the chief in&s;tru|ments in producing. There is no other profe&s;&s;ion, therefore, except merchandize, which can make
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the money'd intere&s;t con&s;iderable, or in other words, can encrea&s;e indu&s;try, and by al&s;o encrea&s;ing fru|gality, give a great command of that indu&s;try to particular members of the &s;ociety. Without com|merce, the &s;tate mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t chiefly of landed gen|try, who&s;e prodigality and expence make a con|tinual demand for borrowing; and of pea&s;ants, who have no &s;ums to &s;upply that demand. The mo|ney never gathers into large &s;tocks or &s;ums, that can be lent at intere&s;t. It is di&s;per&s;t into number|le&s;s hands, who either &s;quander it in idle &s;how and magnificence, or employ it in the purcha&s;e of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life. Commerce alone a&s;&s;embles it into con&s;iderable &s;ums; and this effect it has merely from the indu&s;try, which it begets, and the frugality, which it in&s;pires, independent of the quantity of precious metal, which may cir|culate in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS an encrea&s;e of commerce, by a nece&s;&s;ary and infallible con&s;equence, rai&s;es a great number of lenders, and by that means produces a lowne&s;s of intere&s;t. We mu&s;t now con&s;ider how far this encrea&s;e of commerce dimini&s;hes the profits ari&s;|ing from that profe&s;&s;ion, and gives ri&s;e to the <HI>third</HI> circum&s;tance requi&s;ite to produce a lowne&s;s of in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to ob&s;erve on this head, that low intere&s;t and low profits of merchandize are
<PB N="72" REF="74">
two events, that mutually forward each other, and are both originally deriv'd from that exten&s;ive com|merce, which produces opulent merchants, and renders the money'd intere&s;t con&s;iderable. Where merchants po&s;&s;e&s;s great &s;tocks, whether repre&s;ent|ed by few or many pieces of metal, it mu&s;t fre|quently happen, that, when they either become tir'd of bu&s;ine&s;s, or have heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce, a great deal of the&s;e riches naturally &s;eeks an annual and &s;ecure revenue. The plenty dimini&s;hes their price, and makes the lend|ers accept of a low intere&s;t. This con&s;ideration obliges many to keep their &s;tocks in trade, and ra|ther be content with low profit than di&s;po&s;e of their money at an under-value. On the other hand, when commerce has become very exten&s;ive, and employs very large &s;tocks, there mu&s;t ari&s;e rival|&s;hips among the merchants, which dimini&s;h the profits of trade; at the &s;ame time, that they en|crea&s;e the trade it&s;elf. The low profits of mer|chandize induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low intere&s;t, when they leave off bu&s;ine&s;s, and begin to indulge them&s;elves in ea&s;e and indolence. It is needle&s;s, therefore, to enquire, which of the&s;e circum&s;tances, <HI>viz. low intere&s;t</HI> or <HI>low profits,</HI> is the cau&s;e, and which the effect. They both ari&s;e from an exten&s;ive commerce, and mu|tually forward each other. No man will accept of low profits, where he can have high intere&s;t; and no man will accept of low intere&s;t, where he can
<PB N="73" REF="75">
have high profits. An exten&s;ive commerce, by pro|ducing large &s;tocks, dimini&s;hes both intere&s;t and profit, and is always a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in its diminution of the one, by the proportional &s;inking of the other. I may add, that as low profits ari&s;e from the en|crea&s;e of commerce and indu&s;try; they &s;erve in their turn to the farther encrea&s;e of commerce, by ren|dering the commodities cheaper, encrea&s;ing the con&s;umption, and heightening the indu&s;try. And thus, if we con&s;ider the whole connexion of cau&s;es and effects, intere&s;t is the true barometer of the &s;tate, and its lowne&s;s is a &s;ign almo&s;t infallible of the flouri&s;hing of a people. It proves the encrea&s;e of indu&s;try, and its prompt circulation thro' the whole &s;tate, little inferior to a demon&s;tration. And tho', perhaps, it may not be impo&s;&s;ible but a &s;udden and a great check to commerce may have a momenta|ry effect of the &s;ame kind, by throwing &s;o many &s;tocks out of trade; it mu&s;t be attended with &s;uch mi&s;ery and want of employment in the poor, that, be&s;ides its &s;hort duration, it will not be po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take the one ca&s;e for the other.</P>
<P>THOSE, who have a&s;&s;erted, that the plenty of money was the cau&s;e of low intere&s;t, &s;eem to have taken a collateral effect for a cau&s;e; &s;ince the &s;ame indu&s;try, which &s;inks the intere&s;t, does common|ly acquire great abundance of the precious metals. A variety of fine manufactures, along with vigilant, enterpri&s;ing merchants, will &s;oon draw money to
<PB N="74" REF="76">
a &s;tate, if it be any where to be found in the world. The &s;ame cau&s;e, by multiplying the conveniences of life, and encrea&s;ing indu&s;try, collects great riches into the hands of per&s;ons, who are not proprietors of land, and produces by that means a lowne&s;s of intere&s;t. But tho' the&s;e effects, plenty of money and low intere&s;t, do both naturally ari&s;e from com|merce and indu&s;try, they are altogether indepen|dent of each other. For, &s;uppo&s;e a nation remov'd into the <HI>Pacific</HI> ocean, without any foreign com|merce or any knowledge of navigation: Suppo&s;e, that this nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es always the &s;ame &s;tock of coin, but is continually encrea&s;ing in its numbers and indu&s;try: 'Tis evident, that the price of eve|ry commodity mu&s;t gradually dimini&s;h in that king|dom; &s;ince 'tis the proportion betwixt money and any &s;pecies of goods, which fixes their mutual va|lue; and upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, the conve|niences of life become every day more abundant, without any alteration on the current &s;pecie. A le&s;s quantity of money, therefore, among&s;t this people, will make a rich man, during the times of indu&s;try, than wou'd &s;erve to that purpo&s;e, in ig|norant and &s;lothful ages. Le&s;s money will build a hou&s;e, portion a daughter, buy an e&s;tate, &s;upport a manufactory, or maintain a family and equipage. The&s;e are the u&s;es, for which men borrow money; and therefore, the greater or le&s;s quantity of it in a &s;tate has no influence on the intere&s;t. But 'tis evident, that the greater or le&s;s &s;tock of labour
<PB N="75" REF="77">
and commodities mu&s;t have a great influence; &s;ince we really and in effect borrow the&s;e, when we take money upon intere&s;t. 'Tis true, when commerce is extended all over the globe, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious nations always abound mo&s;t with the precious me|tals: So that low intere&s;t and plenty of money are in fact almo&s;t in&s;eparable. But &s;till 'tis of con&s;e|quence to know the principle, whence any pheno|menon ari&s;es, and to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a cau&s;e and a concomitant effect. Be&s;ides, that the &s;pecu|lation is curious, it may frequently be of u&s;e in the conduct of public affairs. At lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be own'd, that nothing can be of more u&s;e than to improve, by practice, the method of rea&s;oning on the&s;e &s;ub|jects, which, of all others, are the mo&s;t important; tho' they are commonly treated in the loo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t carele&s;s manner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on of this popular mi&s;take with regard to the cau&s;e of low intere&s;t &s;eems to be the in&s;tance of &s;ome nations; where, after a &s;udden ac|qui&s;ition of riches or of the precious metals, by means of foreign conque&s;t, the intere&s;t has fal|len, not only among&s;t them, but in all the neigh|bouring &s;tates, as &s;oon as that money was di&s;per&s;t, and had in&s;inuated it&s;elf into every corner. Thus, intere&s;t in <HI>Spain</HI> fell near a half immediately after the di&s;covery of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> as we are inform'd by <HI>Garcila&s;&s;o de la Vega:</HI> And it has been ever &s;ince gradually &s;inking in every kingdom of <HI>Europe.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="78">
Intere&s;t in <HI>Rome,</HI> after the conque&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> fell from 6 to 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> as we learn from <HI>Dion.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 51.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of the &s;inking of intere&s;t upon &s;uch an event &s;eem different in the conquering country and in the neighbouring &s;tates; but in neither of them can we ju&s;tly a&s;cribe that effect merely to the encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>IN the conquering country, 'tis natural to ima|gine, that this new acqui&s;ition of money will fall into a few hands, and be gather'd into large &s;ums, which &s;eek a &s;ecure revenue, either by the pur|cha&s;e of land or by intere&s;t; and con&s;equently the &s;ame effect follows, for a little time, as if there had been a great occa&s;ion of indu&s;try and com|merce. The encrea&s;e of lenders above the bor|rowers &s;inks the intere&s;t; and &s;o much the fa&s;t|er, if tho&s;e, who have acquir'd tho&s;e large &s;ums, find no indu&s;try or commerce in the &s;tate, and no method of employing their money but by lending it at intere&s;t. But after this new ma&s;s of gold and &s;ilver has been dige&s;ted and has circulated, thro' the whole &s;tate, affairs will &s;oon return to their former &s;ituation: While the landlords and new money-holders, living idly, &s;quander above their in|come; and the former daily contract debt, and the latter encroach on their &s;tock 'till its final extinc|tion. The whole money may &s;till be in the &s;tate,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
and make it&s;elf felt by the encrea&s;e of prices: But not being now collected into any large ma&s;&s;es or &s;tocks, the di&s;proportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders is the &s;ame as formerly, and con&s;e|quently the high intere&s;t returns.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find, in <HI>Rome,</HI> that &s;o ear|ly as <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s time, intere&s;t had again mounted to 6 <HI>per cent.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Columella,</HI> lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE> tho' no accident had happen'd to drain the empire of money.

But this accidental and extraneous cau&s;e, more money is to be lent in <HI>Spain;</HI> that is, more money is collected into large &s;ums, than would otherways be found in a &s;tate, where there are &s;o little commerce and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>As to the reduction of intere&s;t, which has fol|low'd in <HI>England, France,</HI> and other kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> that have no mines, it has been gra|dual, and has not proceeded from the encrea&s;e of money, con&s;ider'd merely in it&s;elf, but from the
<PB N="78" REF="80">
encrea&s;e of indu&s;try, which is the natural effect of the former encrea&s;e, in that interval, before it rai&s;|es the price of labour and provi&s;ions. For to re|turn to the foregoing &s;uppo&s;ition; if the indu&s;try of <HI>England</HI> had ri&s;en as much from other cau&s;es (and that ri&s;e might ea&s;ily have happen'd, tho' the &s;tock of money had remain'd the &s;ame) mu&s;t not all the &s;ame con&s;equences have follow'd, which we ob&s;erve at pre&s;ent? The &s;ame people wou'd, in that ca&s;e, be found in the kingdom, the &s;ame commo|dities, the &s;ame indu&s;try, manufactures and com|merce, and con&s;equently the &s;ame merchants, with the &s;ame &s;tocks, that is, with the &s;ame command over labour and commodities, only repre&s;ented by a &s;maller number of white or yellow pieces: Which being a circum&s;tance of no moment, would only affect the waggoner, porter, and trunk-maker. Lu|xury, therefore, manufactures, arts, indu&s;try, fru|gality, flouri&s;hing equally as at pre&s;ent, 'tis evident that intere&s;t mu&s;t al&s;o have been as low; &s;ince that is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of all the&s;e circum&s;tances; &s;o far as they determine the profits of commerce, and the proportion betwixt the borrowers and lend|ers in any &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE V. <HI>Of the Balance of Trade.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS very u&s;ual, among&s;t nations ignorant of the nature of commerce, to prohibit the exportation of commodities, and to pre&s;erve a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, whatever they think valuable and u&s;eful. They con&s;ider not, that, in this pro|hibition, they act directly contrary to their inten|tions, and that the more is exported of any com|modity, the more will be rais'd at home, of which they them&s;elves will always have the fir&s;t offer.</P>
<P>'TIS well known to the learned, that the antient laws of <HI>Athens</HI> render'd the exportation of figs cri|minal; that being &s;uppos'd a &s;pecies of fruit &s;o ex|cellent in <HI>Attica,</HI> that the <HI>Athenians</HI> e&s;teem'd it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in this ridiculous prohibition they were &s;o much in earne&s;t, that informers were thence called &s;y|cophants among them, from two <HI>Greek</HI> words, which &s;ignify <HI>figs</HI> and <HI>di&s;coverer.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>de curio&s;itate.</HI></NOTE> I have been told, that many old acts of parliament &s;how the &s;ame ignorance in the nature of commerce. And to this day, in a neighbouring kingdom, the exporta|tion of corn is almo&s;t always prohibited; in order,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
as they &s;ay, to prevent famines; tho' 'tis evident, that nothing contributes more to the frequent fa|mines, which &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s that fertile country.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame jealous fear with regard to money has al&s;o prevail'd among&s;t &s;everal nations; and it requir'd both rea&s;on and experience to convince any people, that the&s;e prohibitions &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e than to rai&s;e the exchange again&s;t them, and produce a &s;till greater exportation.</P>
<P>THESE errors, one may &s;ay, are gro&s;s and palp|able: But there &s;till prevails, even among&s;t nati|ons well acquainted with commerce, a &s;trong jea|lou&s;y with regard to the balance of trade, and a fear, that all their gold and &s;ilver may be leaving them. This &s;eems to me, almo&s;t in every ca&s;e, a very groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ion; and I &s;hou'd as &s;oon dread, that all our &s;prings and rivers wou'd be exhau&s;ted, as that money &s;hou'd abandon a king|dom, where there are people and indu&s;try. Let us carefully pre&s;erve the&s;e latter advantages; and we need never be apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing the former.</P>
<P>'TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that all calculations con|cerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and &s;uppo&s;itions. The cu&s;tom|hou&s;e books are own'd to be an in&s;ufficient ground of rea&s;oning; nor is the rate of exchange much better, unle&s;s we con&s;ider it with all nations, and
<PB N="81" REF="83">
know al&s;o the proportions of the &s;everal &s;ums re|mitted; which one may &s;afely pronounce impo&s;|&s;ible. Every man, who has ever rea&s;on'd on this &s;ubject, has always prov'd his theory, whatever it was, by facts and calculations, and by an enume|ration of all the commodities &s;ent to all foreign kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE writings of Mr. <HI>Gee</HI> &s;truck the nation with an univer&s;al pannic, when they &s;aw it plainly de|mon&s;trated, by a detail of particulars, that the ba|lance was again&s;t them for &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um as mu&s;t leave them without a &s;ingle &s;hilling in five or &s;ix years. But, luckily, twenty years have &s;ince elaps'd, along with an expen&s;ive foreign war; and yet 'tis commonly &s;uppos'd, that money is &s;till more plentiful among&s;t us than in any former period.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more entertaining on this head than Dr. <HI>Swift;</HI> an author, who has more humour than knowledge, more ta&s;te than judg|ment, and more &s;pleen, prejudice, and pa&s;&s;ion than any of the&s;e qualities. He &s;ays, in his <HI>&s;hort view of the &s;tate of</HI> Ireland, that the whole ca&s;h of that kingdom amounted but to 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> that out of this they remitted every year a neat million to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and had &s;carce any other &s;ource to compen|&s;ate them&s;elves from, and little other foreign trade but the importation of <HI>French</HI> wines, for which they pay'd ready money. The con&s;equence of
<PB N="82" REF="84">
this &s;ituation, which mu&s;t be own'd di&s;advantage|ous, was, that in a cour&s;e of three years, the cur|rent money of <HI>Ireland,</HI> from 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> was re|duc'd to le&s;s than two. And at pre&s;ent, I &s;uppo&s;e, in a cour&s;e of near 30 years, it is ab&s;olutely nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the advance of riches in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which gave the doctor &s;o much indignation, &s;eems &s;till to continue, and gain ground among&s;t every body.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, this apprehen&s;ion of the wrong balance of trade, appears of &s;uch a nature, that it di&s;covers it&s;elf, wherever one is out of humour with the mini&s;try, or is in low &s;pirits; and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports, which counterbalance the imports, it may here be proper to form a general argument, which may prove the impo&s;&s;ibility of that event, as long as we pre&s;erve our people and our indu&s;try.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE four parts of all the money in <HI>Britain</HI> to be annihilated in one night, and the nation re|duc'd to the &s;ame condition, in this particular, as in the reigns of the <HI>Harrys</HI> and <HI>Edwards;</HI> what would be the con&s;equence? Mu&s;t not the price of all labour and commodities &s;ink in proportion, and every thing be &s;old as cheap as they were in tho&s;e ages? What nation could then di&s;pute with us in any foreign market, or pretend to navigate or to &s;ell manufactures at the &s;ame price, which to us
<PB N="83" REF="85">
wou'd afford &s;ufficient profit? In how little time, therefore, mu&s;t this bring back the money, which we had lo&s;t, and rai&s;e us to the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where, after we have ar|riv'd, we immediately lo&s;e the advantage of the cheapne&s;s of labour and commodities; and the farther flowing in of money is &s;topt by our fulne&s;s and repletion.</P>
<P>AGAIN; &s;uppo&s;e, that all the money in <HI>Britain</HI> were multiply'd four-fold in a night, mu&s;t not the contrary effect follow? Mu&s;t not all labour and commodities ri&s;e to &s;uch an exorbitant height, that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us; while their commodities, on the other hand, became &s;o cheap in compari&s;on, that, in &s;pite of all the laws, which cou'd be form'd, they wou'd be run in upon us, and our money wou'd flow out; 'till we fall to a level with foreigners, and lo&s;e that great &s;uperiority of riches, which had laid us under &s;uch di&s;advantages?</P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, that the &s;ame cau&s;es, which wou'd correct the&s;e exorbitant inequalities, were they to happen miraculou&s;ly, mu&s;t prevent their happening in the common cour&s;e of nature, and mu&s;t for ever, in all neighbouring nations, pre&s;erve money nearly proportion'd to the art and indu&s;try of each nation. All water, wherever it commu|nicates, remains always at a level: Ask naturali&s;ts

the rea&s;on; they tell you, that were it to be rais'd in any one place, the &s;uperior gravity of that part, not being balanc'd, mu&s;t depre&s;s it, 'till it meets a counterpoize; and that the &s;ame cau&s;e, which re|dre&s;&s;es the inequality, when it happens, mu&s;t for ever prevent it, without &s;ome violent, external o|peration.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THERE is another cau&s;e, tho' more limited in its operation, which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every particular nati|on, to which the kingdom trades. When we import more goods than we export, the exchange turns again&s;t us, and this becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the charge of carriage and in&s;urance of the money due would amount to. For the ex|change can never ri&s;e higher than that &s;um.</NOTE></P>
<P>CAN one imagine, that it had ever been po&s;|&s;ible, by any laws, or even by any art, or indu&s;try, to have pre&s;erv'd all the money in <HI>Spain,</HI> which the galleons have brought from the <HI>Indies?</HI> Or that all commodities cou'd be &s;old in <HI>France</HI> for a tenth of the price they wou'd yield on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> without finding their way thither, and draining from that immen&s;e trea&s;ure? What other rea&s;on, indeed, is there, why all nations, at pre&s;ent, gain in their trade with <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu|gal;</HI> but becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to heap up mo|ney, more than any fluid, beyond its proper level? The &s;overeigns of the&s;e countries have &s;hown, that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and &s;ilver to them&s;elves, had it been in any degree prac|ticable.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
BUT as any body of water may be rais'd above the level of the &s;urrounding element, if the form|er has no communication with the latter; &s;o in money, if the communication be cut off, by any material or phy&s;ical impediment (for all laws alone are ineffectual) there may, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be a ve|ry great inequality of money. Thus the immen&s;e di&s;tance of <HI>China,</HI> along with the monopolies of our <HI>India</HI> companies, ob&s;tructing the communication, pre&s;erve in <HI>Europe</HI> the gold and &s;ilver, e&s;pecially the latter, in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom. But notwith&s;tanding this great ob&s;truction, the force of the cau&s;es above mention'd is &s;till evident. The &s;kill and ingenu|ity of <HI>Europe</HI> in general much &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> with regard to manual arts and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade thither without great di&s;advantage: And were it not for the continual re|cruits we receive from <HI>America,</HI> money wou'd ve|ry &s;oon &s;ink in <HI>Europe,</HI> and ri&s;e in <HI>China,</HI> 'till it came nearly to a level in both places. Nor can any rea&s;onable man doubt, but that indu&s;trious na|tion, were they as near us as <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Barba|ry,</HI> would drain us of the overplus of our &s;pecie, and draw to them&s;elves a larger &s;hare of the <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> trea&s;ures. We need have no recour&s;e to a phy&s;ical attraction, to explain the nece&s;&s;ity of this operation. There is a moral attraction, ari&s;ing from the intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men, which is full as potent and infallible.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">
HOW is the balance kept in the provinces of e|very kingdom among them&s;elves, but by the force of this principle, which makes it impo&s;&s;ible for mo|ney to lo&s;e its level, and either to ri&s;e or &s;ink, be|yond the proportion of the labour and commodi|ties, that is in each province? Did not long expe|rience make people ea&s;y on this head, what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford a melancholy <HI>York&s;hire</HI> man; while he computed and magnify'd the &s;ums drawn to <HI>London</HI> by taxes, ab&s;entees, commodities; and found on compari&s;on the oppo&s;ite articles &s;o much inferior? And no doubt, had the <HI>Heptarchy</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in <HI>England,</HI> the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate had been continually a|larm'd by the fear of a wrong balance; and as 'tis probable, that the mutual hatred of the&s;e &s;tates wou'd have been extremely violent, on account of their clo&s;e neighbourhood, they wou'd have loaded and oppre&s;t all commerce, by a jealous and &s;uperflu|ous caution.

<P>WHAT happens in &s;mall portions of mankind mu&s;t take place in greater. The provinces of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, no doubt, kept their balance with each other, and with <HI>Italy,</HI> independent of the le|gi&s;lature; as much as the &s;everal counties of <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> or the &s;everal pari&s;hes of each county. And any man, who travels over <HI>Europe,</HI> at this day, may &s;ee, by the prices of commodities, that mo|ney, in &s;pite of the ab&s;urd jealou&s;y of princes and &s;tates, has brought it&s;elf nearly to a level, and that the difference betwixt one kingdom and another is not greater in this re&s;pect, than it is often betwixt different provinces of the &s;ame kingdom. Men naturally flock to capital cities, &s;ea-ports, and na|vigable rivers. There we find more men, more indu&s;try, more labour, and con&s;equently more mo|ney; but &s;till the latter difference holds proportion with the former, and the level is pre&s;erv'd.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT mu&s;t carefully be remark'd, that, throughout this di&s;cour&s;e, wherever I &s;peak of the level of money, I mean always its pro|portional level to the commodities, labour, indu&s;try, and skill, which is in the &s;everal &s;tates. And I a&s;&s;ert, that, where the&s;e advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what they are in the neighbouring &s;tates, the money infallibly will al&s;o be double, triple, quadruple. The only circum&s;tance, that can ob&s;tru&s;t the exact|ne&s;s of the&s;e proportions, is the expence of tran&s;porting the com|modities from one place to another; and this expence is &s;ometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle, chee&s;e, butter of <HI>Derby&s;hire</HI> cannot draw the money of <HI>London,</HI> &s;o much as the manufactures of <HI>London</HI> draw the money of <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI> But this objection is on|ly a &s;eeming one: For &s;o far as the tran&s;port of commodities is ex|pen&s;ive, &s;o far is the communication betwixt the places ob&s;truct|ed and imperfect.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">
OUR jealou&s;y and our hatred of <HI>France</HI> are with|out bounds; and the former &s;entiment, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be acknowledg'd very rea&s;onable and well ground|ed. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have occa&s;ion'd innumerable barriers and ob&s;tructions upon commerce, where we are accus'd of being commonly the aggre&s;&s;ors. But what have we gain'd by the bargain? We lo&s;t the <HI>French</HI> market for our woolen manufactures, and transferr'd the commerce of wine to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> where we buy much wor&s;e liquor at a higher price. There are few <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that wou'd not think their country ab&s;olutely ruin'd, were <HI>French</HI> wines &s;old in <HI>England</HI> &s;o cheap and in &s;uch abundance as to &s;upplant, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, all ale and home-brewn liquors: But wou'd we lay a|&s;ide prejudice, it wou'd not be difficult to prove, that nothing cou'd be more innocent, perhaps ad|vantageous. Each new acre of vineyard planted in <HI>France,</HI> in order to &s;upply <HI>England</HI> with wine, wou'd make it requi&s;ite for the <HI>French</HI> to take the product of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> acre, &s;own in wheat or bar|ley, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; and 'tis evi|dent, we have thereby got command of the better commodity.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">
THERE are many edicts of the <HI>French</HI> king, pro|hibiting the planting of new vineyards, and order|ing all tho&s;e lately planted to be grubb'd up: So &s;en&s;ible are they, in that country, of the &s;uperior value of corn, above every other product.</P>
<P>MARESCHAL <HI>Vauban</HI> complains often, and with rea&s;on, of the ab&s;urd duties, which load the entry of wines of <HI>Languedoc, Guienne</HI> and tho&s;e other &s;outhern provinces, that are imported into <HI>Britany</HI> and <HI>Normandy.</HI> He entertain'd no doubt, but the&s;e latter provinces cou'd pre&s;erve their ba|lance, notwith&s;tanding the open commerce, which he recommends. And 'tis evident, that a few leagues more navigation to <HI>England</HI> wou'd make no difference: Or if it did, that it mu&s;t operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed one expedient, by which it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;ink, and another by which we may rai&s;e, money beyond its natural level in any king|dom; but the&s;e ca&s;es, when examin'd, will be found to re&s;olve into our general theory, and to bring ad|ditional authority to it.</P>
<P>I SCARCE know any method of &s;inking money below its level; but tho&s;e in&s;titutions of banks, funds, and paper credit, with which we are in this kingdom &s;o much infatuated. The&s;e render
<PB N="90" REF="92">
paper equivalent to money, circulate it thro' the whole &s;tate, make it &s;upply the place of gold and &s;ilver, rai&s;e proportionably the price of labour and commodities, and by that means either bani&s;h a great part of tho&s;e precious metals, or prevent their farther encrea&s;e. What can be more &s;hort-&s;ight|ed than our rea&s;onings on this head? We fancy, becau&s;e an individual wou'd be much richer, were his &s;tock of money doubled, that the &s;ame good ef|fect wou'd follow were the money of every one encreas'd; not con&s;idering, that this wou'd rai&s;e as much the price of every commodity, and reduce every man, in time, to the &s;ame condition as be|fore. 'Tis only in our public negotiations and tran&s;actions with foreigners, that a greater &s;tock of money is advantageous; and as our paper is there ab&s;olutely in&s;ignificant, we feel, by its means, all the ill effects, ari&s;ing from a great abundance of money, without reaping any of the advantages.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE there are 12 millions of paper, that circulate in the kingdom as money (for we are not to imagine, that all our enormous funds are em|ploy'd in that &s;hape) and &s;uppo&s;e, that the real ca&s;h of the kingdom is 18 millions: Here is a &s;tate, which is found by experience able to hold a &s;tock of 30 millions. I &s;ay, if it be able to hold it, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have acquir'd it in gold and &s;ilver, had we not ob&s;tructed the entrance of the&s;e metals by this new invention of paper. <HI>Whence would it</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="93">
<HI>have acquir'd that &s;um?</HI> From all the kingdoms of the world. <HI>But why?</HI> Becau&s;e, if you remove the&s;e 12 millions, money in this &s;tate is below its level, compar'd with our neighbours; and we mu&s;t immediately draw from all of them, till we be full and &s;aturate, &s;o to &s;peak, and can hold no more. By our wi&s;e politics, we are as careful to &s;tuff the nation with this fine commodity of bank|bills and chequer-notes, as if we were afraid of be|ing overburthen'd with the precious metals.</P>
<P>'TIS not to be doubted, but the great plenty of bullion in <HI>France,</HI> is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the want of paper credit. The <HI>French</HI> have no banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as with us: U&s;ury or lending on intere&s;t is not di|rectly permitted; &s;o that many have large &s;ums in their coffers: Great quantities of plate are us'd in private hou&s;es; and all the churches are full of it. By this means, provi&s;ions and labour &s;till remain much cheaper among&s;t them than in nations that are not half &s;o rich in gold and &s;ilver. The ad|vantage of this &s;ituation in point of trade, as well as in great public emergencies, is too evident to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame fa&s;hion, a few years ago, prevail'd in <HI>Genoa,</HI> which &s;till has place in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land,</HI> of u&s;ing &s;ervices of <HI>China</HI> ware in&s;tead of plate; but the &s;enate, wi&s;ely fore&s;eeing the con&s;e|quences,
<PB N="92" REF="94">
prohibited the u&s;e of that brittle commo|dity beyond a certain extent; while the u&s;e of &s;il|ver plate was left unlimited. And I &s;uppo&s;e, in their late di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they felt the good effect of this ordonnance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">OUR tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view, impolitic.</NOTE></P>
<P>BEFORE the introduction of paper money into our colonies, they had gold and &s;ilver &s;ufficient for their circulation. Since the introduction of that commodity, the lea&s;t of the inconveniencies that has follow'd, is the total bani&s;hment of the preci|ous metals. And after the abolition of paper, can it be doubted but money will return, while the&s;e colonies po&s;&s;e&s;s manufactures and commodities, the only things valuable in commerce, and for who&s;e &s;ake alone all men de&s;ire money.</P>
<P>WHAT pity <HI>Lycurgus</HI> did not think of paper cre|dit, when he wanted to bani&s;h gold and &s;ilver from <HI>Sparta!</HI> It wou'd have &s;erv'd his purpo&s;e better than the lumps of iron he made u&s;e of as money; and wou'd al&s;o have prevented more effectually all commerce with &s;trangers, as being of &s;o much le&s;s real and intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>BUT as our darling projects of paper credit are pernicious, being almo&s;t the only expedient, by which we can &s;ink money below its level; &s;o in my opinion the only expedient, by which we can rai&s;e money above its level, is a practice we wou'd all

exclaim again&s;t as de&s;tructive, <HI>viz.</HI> the gathering large &s;ums into a public trea&s;ure, locking them up, and ab&s;olutely preventing their circulation. The fluid, not communicating with the neigh|bouring element, may, by &s;uch an artifice, be rais'd to what height we plea&s;e. To prove this, we need only return to our fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, of the anni|hilating the half or any part of our ca&s;h; where we found, that the immediate con&s;equence of &s;uch an event wou'd be, the attraction of an equal &s;um from all the neighbouring kingdoms. Nor does there &s;eem to be any nece&s;&s;ary bounds &s;et, by the nature of things, to this practice of hoarding. A &s;mall city, like <HI>Geneva,</HI> continuing this policy for ages, might engro&s;s nine tenths of the money of <HI>Europe.</HI> There &s;eems, indeed, in the nature of man, an invincible ob&s;tacle to that immen&s;e growth of riches. A weak &s;tate, with an enormous trea&s;ure, wou'd &s;oon become a prey to &s;ome of its poorer but more powerful neighbours. A great &s;tate wou'd di&s;&s;ipate its wealth on dangerous and ill|concerted projects; and probably de&s;troy, along with it, what is much more valuable, the indu&s;try, morals, and numbers of its people. The fluid, in this ca&s;e, rais'd to too great a height, bur&s;ts and de&s;troys the ve&s;&s;el, that contains it; and mixing it|&s;elf with the &s;urrounding element, &s;oon falls to its proper level.</P>

<P>FROM the&s;e principles we may learn what judg|ment we ought to form of tho&s;e numberle&s;s bars, ob&s;tructions, and impo&s;ts, which all nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and none more than <HI>England,</HI> have put upon trade; from an exorbitant de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing money, which never will heap up beyond its le|vel, while it circulates; or from an ill grounded ap|prehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing their &s;pecie, which never will &s;ink below it. Cou'd any thing &s;catter our riches, 'twou'd be &s;uch impolitic contrivances. But this general ill effect, however, re&s;ults from them, that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free com|munication and exchange, which the author of the world has intended, by giving them &s;oils, climates, and geniu&s;es, &s;o different from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">
OUR modern politics embrace the only method of bani&s;hing money, the u&s;ing paper credit; they reject the only method of ama&s;&s;ing it, the practice of hoarding; and they adopt a hundred contrivan|ces, which &s;erve to no purpo&s;e but to check indu&s;|try, and rob our&s;elves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature.</P>
<P>ALL taxes, however, upon foreign commodi|ties, are not to be regarded as prejudicial or u&s;ele&s;s, but tho&s;e only which are founded on the jealou|&s;y above mention'd. A tax on <HI>German</HI> linen en|courages home manufactures, and thereby multi|plies our people and indu&s;try. A tax on brandy encrea&s;es the &s;ale of rum, and &s;upports our &s;outhern colonies. And as 'tis nece&s;&s;ary impo&s;ts &s;hou'd be levy'd for the &s;upport of government, it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities, which can ea&s;ily be intercepted at the port, and &s;ubjected to the impo&s;t. We ought, however, always to remember the maxim of Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> that, in the arithmetic of the cu&s;toms, two and two make not four, but often make only one. It can &s;carcely be doubted, but if the duties on wine were lower'd to a third, they wou'd yield much more to the government than at pre&s;ent: Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more whol&s;ome liquor: And no preju|dice wou'd en&s;ue to the balance of trade, of which
<PB N="99" REF="101">
we are &s;o jealous. The manufacture of ale, beyond the agriculture, is but incon&s;iderable, and gives employment to few hands. The tran&s;port of wine and corn wou'd not be much inferior.</P>
<P>BUT are there not frequent in&s;tances, you will &s;ay, of &s;tates and kingdoms, that were formerly rich and opulent, and are now poor and beggarly? Has not the money left them, with which they formerly abounded? I an&s;wer, If they lo&s;e their trade, indu&s;try, and people, they cannot expect to keep their gold and &s;ilver: For the&s;e precious me|tals hold proportion to the former advantages. When <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> got the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade from <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> they al&s;o got the pro|fits and money, that aro&s;e from it. Where the &s;eat of government is transferr'd, where expen&s;ive armies are maintain'd at a di&s;tance, where great funds are po&s;&s;e&s;t by foreigners; there naturally fol|lows from the&s;e cau&s;es a diminution of the &s;pecie. But the&s;e, we may ob&s;erve, are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money, and are in time commonly attended with the tran&s;port of people and indu&s;try. But where the&s;e remain, and the drain is not continu'd, the money always finds its way back again, by a hundred canals, of which we have no notion nor &s;u&s;picion. What immen&s;e trea|&s;ures have been &s;pent, by &s;o many nations, in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> &s;ince the revolution, in the cour&s;e of three long wars? More money perhaps, than the half of what
<PB N="100" REF="102">
is at pre&s;ent in all <HI>Europe.</HI> But what has now be|come of it? Is it in the narrow compa&s;s of the <HI>Au&s;|trian</HI> provinces? No &s;urely: It has mo&s;t of it re|turn'd to the &s;everal countries, whence it came, and has follow'd that art and indu&s;try, by which, at fir&s;t, it was acquir'd.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, a government has great rea&s;on to pre|&s;erve with care its people and its manufactures. Its money, it may &s;afely tru&s;t to the cour&s;e of human affairs, without fear or jealou&s;y.

<HEAD>DISCOURSE VI. <HI>Of the Balance of Power.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a que&s;tion, whether the <HI>idea</HI> of the balance of power be owing entirely to modern policy, or whether the <HI>phra&s;e</HI> only has been invented in the&s;e latter ages. 'Tis certain, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. I.</NOTE> <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in his in&s;titution of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> repre&s;ents the combination of the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> powers to have ari&s;en from a jealou&s;y of the encrea&s;ing force of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and tho' that elegant compo&s;ition &s;hou'd be &s;up|pos'd altogether a romance, this &s;entiment, a&s;crib'd by the author to the Ea&s;tern princes, is at lea&s;t a proof of the prevailing notions of antient times.</P>
<P>IN the whole politics of <HI>Greece,</HI> the anxiety, with regard to the balance, is mo&s;t apparent, and is expre&s;sly pointed out to us, even by the antient hi&s;torians. <HI>Thucydides</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. I.</NOTE> repre&s;ents the league, which was form'd again&s;t <HI>Athens,</HI> and which produc'd the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> war, as entirely owing to this prin|ciple. And after the decline of <HI>Athens,</HI> when the <HI>Thebans</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> di&s;puted for &s;overeigni|ty, we find, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> (as well as many other republics) threw them&s;elves always into the
<PB N="102" REF="104">
lighter &s;cale, and endeavour'd to pre&s;erve the ba|lance. They &s;upported <HI>Thebes</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sparta,</HI> till the great victory, gain'd by <HI>Epaminondas</HI> at <HI>Leuc|tra;</HI> after which they immediately went over to the conquer'd, from genero&s;ity, as they pretended, but, in reality, from their jealou&s;y of the conquer|ors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Xenoph.</HI> hi&s;t, <HI>Graec,</HI> lib. 6. &amp; 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHOEVER will read <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>'s oration for the <HI>Megalopolitans,</HI> may &s;ee the utmo&s;t refinements on this principle, that ever enter'd into the head of a <HI>Venetian</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;peculati&s;t. And upon the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the <HI>Macedonian</HI> power, this orator im|mediately di&s;cover'd the danger, &s;ounded the alarm thro' all <HI>Greece,</HI> and at la&s;t a&s;&s;embled that confede|racy under the banners of <HI>Athens,</HI> which fought the great and deci&s;ive battle of <HI>Chaeronea.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS true, the <HI>Grecian</HI> wars are regarded by hi&s;torians as wars of emulation rather than of poli|tics; and each &s;tate &s;eems to have had more in view the honour of leading the re&s;t than any well|grounded hopes of authority and dominion. If we con&s;ider, indeed, the &s;mall number of inhabitants in any one republic, compar'd to the whole, the great difficulty of forming &s;ieges in tho&s;e times, and the extraordinary bravery and di&s;cipline of every free|man among&s;t that noble people; we &s;hall con|clude,
<PB N="103" REF="105">
that the balance of power was of it&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently &s;ecur'd in <HI>Greece,</HI> and needed not to be guarded with that caution, which may be requi|&s;ite in other ages. But whether we a&s;cribe the &s;hifting &s;ides in all the <HI>Grecian</HI> republics to <HI>jealous emulation</HI> or <HI>cautious politics,</HI> the effects were a|like, and every prevailing power was &s;ure to meet with a confederacy again&s;t it, and that often com|pos'd of its former friends and allies.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle, call it envy or prudence, which produc'd the <HI>O&s;traci&s;m</HI> of <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Petali&s;m</HI> of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> and expell'd every citizen, who&s;e fame or power overtop'd the re&s;t; the &s;ame principle, I &s;ay, naturally di&s;cover'd it&s;elf in foreign politics, and &s;oon rais'd enemies to the leading &s;tate, how|ever moderate in the exerci&s;e of its authority.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> monarch was really, in his force, a petty prince, compar'd to the <HI>Grecian</HI> republics; and therefore it behov'd him, from views of &s;afety more than from emulation, to intere&s;t him&s;elf in their quarrels, and to &s;upport the weaker &s;ide in every conte&s;t. This was the advice given by <HI>Alcibiades</HI> to <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thuc.</HI> lib. 8.</NOTE> and it prolong'd near a century the date of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> empire; till the neglect of it for a moment, after the fir&s;t appearance of the a&s;piring genius of <HI>Philip,</HI> brought that lofty and frail edifice to the ground,
<PB N="104" REF="106">
with a rapidity, of which there are few in&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Alexander</HI> &s;how'd an infinite jealou&s;y of the balance of power; a jealou&s;y, found|ed on true politics and prudence, and which pre|&s;erv'd di&s;tinct for &s;everal ages the partitions made after the death of that famous conqueror. The fortune and ambition of <HI>Antigonus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diod, Sic.</HI> lib. 20.</NOTE> threaten'd them anew with an univer&s;al monarchy; but their com|bination and their victory at <HI>Ip&s;us</HI> &s;av'd them. And in after times, we find, that, as the Ea&s;tern princes con&s;ider'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Macedonians</HI> as the only real military force, with whom they had any in|tercour&s;e, they kept always a watchful eye over that part of the world. The <HI>Ptolemies,</HI> in particu|lar, &s;upported fir&s;t <HI>Aratus</HI> and the <HI>Achaeans,</HI> and then <HI>Cleomenes</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> from no other view than as a counterbalance to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> mo|narchs. For this is the account, which <HI>Polybius</HI> gives of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> politics.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 51.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why 'tis &s;uppos'd, that the antients were intirely ignorant of the <HI>balance of power,</HI> &s;eems to be drawn from the <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory more than the <HI>Greek;</HI> and as the tran&s;actions of the former are generally the mo&s;t familiar to us, we have thence form'd all our conclu&s;ions.

own'd, that the <HI>Romans</HI> never met with any &s;uch general combination or confederacy again&s;t them, as might naturally be expected from their rapid conque&s;ts and declar'd ambition; but were al|low'd peaceably to &s;ubdue their neighbours, one after another, till they extended their dominion o|ver the whole known world. Not to mention the fabulous hi&s;tory of their <HI>Italic</HI> wars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THERE have &s;trong &s;u&s;picions, of late, ari&s;en among&s;t crities, and, in my opinion, not without rea&s;on, concerning the fir&s;t ages of the <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory; as if they were almo&s;t entirely fabulous, 'till after the &s;acking of the city by the <HI>Gauls;</HI> and were even doubtful for &s;ome time afterwards, 'till the <HI>Greeks</HI> began to give attention to <HI>Roman</HI> affairs, and commit them to writing. This &s;ceptici&s;m, however, &s;eems to me &s;carcely defen&s;ible in its full extent, with regard to the dome&s;tic hi&s;tory of <HI>Rome,</HI> which has &s;ome air of truth and probability, and cou'd &s;carce be the inven|tion of an hi&s;torian, who had &s;o little morals or judgment as to in|dulge him&s;elf in fiction and romance. The revolutions &s;eem &s;o well proportion'd to their cau&s;es: The progre&s;s of the factions is &s;o conformable to political experience: The manners and maxims of the age are &s;o uniform and natural, that &s;carce any real hi&s;to|ry affords more ju&s;t reflection and improvement. Is not <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s comment on <HI>Livy</HI> (a work &s;urely of great judgment and genius) founded entirely on this period, which is repre&s;ented as fabulous. I wou'd willingly, therefore, in my private &s;entiments, divide the matter with the&s;e critics; and allow, that the battles and vic|tories and triumphs of tho&s;e ages had been extremely fal&s;ify'd by family memoirs, as <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays they were: But as in the accounts of dome&s;tic factions, there were two oppo&s;ite relations tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, this both &s;erv'd as a check upon fiction, and enabled latter hi&s;torians to gather &s;ome truth from compari&s;on and rea&s;on|ing.

If it was not &s;o generally known, and acknowledg'd as at pre&s;ent, it had, at lea&s;t, an influence on all the wi&s;er and more ex|perienc'd princes and politicians. And indeed, e|ven at pre&s;ent, however generally known and ac|knowledged, among&s;t &s;peculative rea&s;oners, it has not, in practice, an authority much more exten&s;ive, among&s;t tho&s;e who govern the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, the form of government e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the northern con|querors, incapacitated them, in a great mea&s;ure, from farther conque&s;ts, and long maintain'd each &s;tate in its proper boundaries. But when va&s;&s;alage and the feudal militia were aboli&s;h'd, mankind were anew alarm'd by the danger of univer&s;al mo|narchy,

from the union of &s;o many kingdoms and principalities in the per&s;on of the emperor, <HI>Charles.</HI> But the power of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> founded on exten&s;ive but divided dominions, and their rich|es, deriv'd chiefly from mines of gold and &s;ilver, were more likely to decay, of them&s;elves, from internal defects, than to overthrow all the bulwarks rais'd again&s;t them. In le&s;s than a century, the force of that violent and haughty race was &s;hat|ter'd, their opulence di&s;&s;ipated, their &s;plendor e|clips'd. A new power &s;ucceeded, more formida|ble to the liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the ad|vantages of the former, and labouring under none of its defects; except a &s;hare of that &s;pirit of bi|gotry and per&s;ecution, with which the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> were &s;o long and &s;till are &s;o much infa|tuated.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> has now, for above a century, remain'd on the defen&s;ive again&s;t the greate&s;t force, that e|ver, perhaps, was form'd by the civil or political combination of mankind.

On the contrary, there remain &s;till &s;ome hopes of maintaining the re&s;i&s;tance &s;o long, that the natu|ral revolutions of human affairs, together with un|fore&s;een events and accidents, may guard us a|gain&s;t univer&s;al monarchy, and pre&s;erve the world from &s;o great an evil.</P>

<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, we are &s;uch true combatants, that, when once engag'd, we lo&s;e all concern for our&s;elves and our po&s;terity, and con&s;ider only how we may be&s;t annoy the enemy.

<HEAD>DISCOURSE VII. <HI>Of Taxes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a maxim, that prevails among&s;t tho&s;e, whom, in this country, we call <HI>ways and means men,</HI> and who are denominated <HI>Finan|ciers</HI> and <HI>Maltotiers</HI> in <HI>France; that every new tax creates a new ability in the &s;ubjects to bear it, and that each encrea&s;e of publick burthens encrea&s;es proportion|ably the indu&s;try of the people.</HI> This maxim is of &s;uch a nature as is mo&s;t likely to be extremely a|bus'd, and is &s;o much the more dangerous, that its truth cannot be altogether deny'd; but it mu&s;t be own'd; when kept within certain bounds, to have &s;ome foundation in rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>WHEN a tax is laid upon commodities, that are con&s;um'd by the common people, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence may &s;eem to be, that either the poor mu&s;t retrench &s;omething from their way of living, or rai&s;e their wages, &s;o as to make the burthen of the tax fall entirely upon the rich. But there is a third con&s;equence, which very often follows upon taxes, <HI>viz.</HI> that the poor encrea&s;e their indu&s;try, perform more work, and live as well as before, without de|manding more for their labour. Where taxes are moderate, are laid on gradually, and affect not the
<PB N="116" REF="120">
nece&s;&s;aries of life, this con&s;equence naturally follows; and 'tis certain, that &s;uch difficulties often &s;erve to excite the indu&s;try of a people, and render them more opulent and laborious than others, who enjoy the greate&s;t advantages. For we may ob&s;erve, as a parallel in&s;tance, that the mo&s;t trading nations have not always po&s;&s;e&s;t the greate&s;t extent of fertile land; but on the contrary, that they have labour'd under many natural di&s;advantages. <HI>Tyre, Athens, Car|thage, Rhodes, Genoa, Venice, Holland</HI> are &s;trong examples to this purpo&s;e. And in all hi&s;tory, we find only three in&s;tances of large and fertile coun|tries, that have po&s;&s;e&s;t much trade, the <HI>Netherlands, England,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> The two former &s;eem to have been allur'd by the advantages of their mari|time &s;ituation, and the nece&s;&s;ity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports, in order to procure what their own climate refus'd them. And as to <HI>France,</HI> trade has come very late into that kingdom, and &s;eems to have been the effect of reflection and ob|&s;ervation in an ingenious and enterpri&s;ing people, who remark'd the immen&s;e riches acquir'd by &s;uch of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigati|on and commerce.</P>
<P>THE places mention'd by <HI>Cicero,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epi&s;t. ad Att.</HI> lib. 9. ep. 11.</NOTE> as po&s;&s;e&s;t of the greate&s;t commerce in his time are <HI>Alexandria, Colchos, Tyre, Sidon, Andros, Cyprus, Pamphilia, Lycia, Rhodes, Chios, Byzantium, Lesbos, Smyrna,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="121">
<HI>Miletum, Coos.</HI> All the&s;e, except <HI>Alexandria,</HI> were either &s;mall i&s;lands or narrow territories. And that city ow'd its trade entirely to the happine&s;s of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore &s;ome natural nece&s;&s;ities or di&s;|advantages may be thought favourable to indu&s;try, why may not artificial burthens have the &s;ame ef|fect? Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ACCOUNT of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> chap. 6.</NOTE> I am &s;ure, a&s;cribes the indu&s;try of the <HI>Dutch</HI> entirely to nece&s;&s;ity, proceed|ing from their natural di&s;advantages; and illu&s;trates his doctrine by a very &s;triking compari&s;on with <HI>Ire|land;</HI> <Q>where, (&s;ays he,) by the largene&s;s and plenty of the &s;oil, and &s;carcity of people, all things nece&s;&s;ary to life are &s;o cheap, that an in|du&s;trious man, by two days labour, may gain enough to feed him the re&s;t of the week: Which I take to be a very plain ground of the lazine&s;s, attributed to the people. For men naturally prefer ea&s;e before labour, and will not take pains, if they can live idle; though when, by nece&s;&s;ity, they have been enur'd to it, they cannot leave it, being grown a cu&s;tom nece&s;&s;ary to their health and to their very entertainment: Nor perhaps is the change harder, from con|&s;tant ea&s;e to labour, than from con&s;tant labour to ea&s;e.</Q> After which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as above, the places, where trade has mo&s;t flouri&s;h'd, in
<PB N="118" REF="122">
antient and modern times; and which are com|monly ob&s;erv'd to be &s;uch narrow confin'd terri|tories, as beget a nece&s;&s;ity for indu&s;try.</P>
<P>'TIS always ob&s;erv'd, in years of &s;carcity, if it be not extreme, that the poor labour more, and really live better, than in years of great plenty, when they indulge them&s;elves in idlene&s;s and riot. I have been told, by a con&s;iderable manufacturer, that in the year 1740, when bread and provi&s;ions of all kinds were very dear, his workmen not on|ly made a &s;hift to live, but paid debts, which they had contracted in former years, that were much more favourable and abundant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this purpo&s;e, &s;ee al&s;o di&s;cour&s;e I. at the end.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS doctrine, therefore, with regard to taxes, may be admitted in &s;ome degree: But beware of the abu&s;e. Taxes, like nece&s;&s;ity, when carry'd too far, de&s;troy indu&s;try, by engendring de&s;pair; and even before they reach this pitch, they rai&s;e the wages of the labourer and manufacturer, and heighten the price of all commodities. An atten|tive, di&s;intere&s;ted legi&s;lature will ob&s;erve the point, when the emolument cea&s;es, and the prejudice be|gins: But as the contrary character is much more common, 'tis to be fear'd, that taxes, all over <HI>Europe,</HI> are multiplying to &s;uch a degree, as will entirely cru&s;h all art and indu&s;try; tho', perhaps, their fir&s;t increa&s;e, along with other circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="119" REF="123">
might contribute to the growth of the&s;e ad|vantages.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t taxes are tho&s;e which are levy'd upon con&s;umptions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of luxury; becau&s;e &s;uch taxes are le&s;s felt by the people. They &s;eem to be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, voluntary, &s;ince a man may chu&s;e how far he will u&s;e the commodity, which is taxed: They are paid gradually and in|&s;en&s;ibly: And being confounded with the natural price of the commodity, they are &s;carcely perceiv'd by the con&s;umers. Their only di&s;advantage is, that they are expen&s;ive in the levying.</P>
<P>TAXES upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are levy'd without ex|pence; but have every other di&s;advantage. Mo&s;t &s;tates, however, are oblig'd to have recour&s;e to them, in order to &s;upply the deficiencies of the o|ther.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t pernicious of all taxes are tho&s;e which are arbitrary. They are commonly con|verted, by their management, into puni&s;hments on indu&s;try; and al&s;o, by their unavoidable inequali|ty, are more grievous than by the real burthen, which they impo&s;e. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, therefore, to &s;ee them have place among&s;t any civiliz'd people.</P>
<P>IN general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbi|trary, which they commonly are, may be e&s;teem'd
<PB N="120" REF="124">
dangerous: Becau&s;e it is &s;o ea&s;y for the &s;overeign to add a little more, and a little more, to the &s;um demanded, that the&s;e taxes are apt to become alto|gether oppre&s;&s;ive and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty upon commodities checks it&s;elf; and a prince will &s;oon find, that an encrea&s;e of the im|po&s;t is no encrea&s;e of his revenue. It is not ea&s;y, therefore, for a people to be altogether ruin'd by &s;uch taxes.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS inform us, that one of the chief cau&s;es of the de&s;truction of the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tate was the alteration, which <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> introduc'd into the finances, by &s;ub&s;tituting an univer&s;al poll-tax, in lieu of almo&s;t all the tythes, cu&s;toms, and exci&s;|es, which formerly compos'd the revenue of the <HI>empire.</HI> The people, in all the provinces, were &s;o grinded and oppre&s;t by the <HI>publicans,</HI> that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians; who&s;e dominion, as they had fewer nece&s;&s;ities and le&s;s art, was found preferable to the refin'd tyranny of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a prevailing opinion, that all taxes, however levy'd, fall upon the land at la&s;t. Such an opinion may be u&s;eful in <HI>Britain,</HI> by checking the landed gentlemen, in who&s;e hands our legi&s;lature is lodg'd, and making them pre&s;erve great regard for trade and indu&s;try. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this principle, tho' fir&s;t advanc'd by a celebrated writer,
<PB N="121" REF="125">
has &s;o little appearance of rea&s;on, that, were it not for his authority, it had never been receiv'd by any body. Every man, to be &s;ure, is de&s;irous of pu&s;h|ing off from him&s;elf the burthen of any tax, that is impos'd, and laying it upon others: But as eve|ry man has the &s;ame inclination, and is upon the defen&s;ive; no &s;et of men can be &s;uppos'd to prevail altogether in this conte&s;t. And why the landed gentleman &s;hou'd be the victim of the whole, and &s;hou'd not be able to defend him&s;elf, as well as o|thers are, I cannot readily imagine. All trade&s;men, indeed, wou'd willingly prey upon him, and divide him among them, if they cou'd: But this inclina|tion they always have, tho' no taxes were levy'd; and the &s;ame methods, by which he guards again&s;t the impo&s;ition of trade&s;men before taxes, will &s;erve him afterwards, and make them &s;hare the burthen with him.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that we have, with regard to taxes, an in&s;tance of what frequently happens in political in&s;titutions, that the con&s;equences of things are diametrically oppo&s;ite to what we &s;hou'd expect on the fir&s;t appearance. 'Tis regarded as a fundamental max|im of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> government, that the <HI>Grand &s;ig|nior,</HI> tho' ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no authority to impo&s;e a new tax; and every <HI>Ottoman</HI> prince, who has made &s;uch an attempt, either has been oblig'd to retract,
<PB N="122" REF="126">
or has found the fatal effects of his per&s;everance. One wou'd imagine, that this prejudice or e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd opinion were the firme&s;t barrier in the world again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion; yet'tis certain, that its effect is quite contrary. The emperor, having no regular method of encrea&s;ing his revenue, mu&s;t allow all the ba&s;has and governors to oppre&s;s and abu&s;e the &s;ubjects: And the&s;e he &s;queezes after their return from their government. Whereas, if he cou'd impo&s;e a new tax, like our <HI>European</HI> princes, his intere&s;t wou'd &s;o far be united with that of his peo|ple, that he wou'd immediately feel the bad effects of the&s;e di&s;orderly levies of money, and wou'd find, that a pound, rais'd by a general impo&s;ition, wou'd have le&s;s pernicious effects, than a &s;hilling taken in &s;o unequal and arbitrary a manner.</P>

For why &s;hou'd the ca&s;e be &s;o very different betwixt the public and an indivi|dual, as to make us e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch different maxims of conduct for each? If the funds of the former be
<PB N="125" REF="129">
greater, its nece&s;&s;ary expences are proportionably larger; if its re&s;ources be more numerous, they are not infinite; and as its frame &s;hould be calculated for a much longer duration, than the date of a &s;ingle life, or even of a family, it &s;hou'd embrace max|ims, large, durable, and generous, &s;uitable to the &s;uppos'd extent of its exi&s;tence. To tru&s;t to chan|ces and temporary expedients is, indeed, what the nece&s;&s;ity of human affairs frequently reduces us to; but whoever voluntarily depend on &s;uch re&s;ources have not nece&s;&s;ity, but their own folly, to accu&s;e for their misfortunes, when any &s;uch befal them.</P>
<P>IF the abu&s;es of trea&s;ures be dangerous, either by engaging the &s;tate in ra&s;h enterpri&s;es, or mak|ing them neglect military di&s;cipline, in confidence of their riches; the abu&s;es of mortgaging are more certain and inevitable; poverty, impotence, and &s;ubjection to foreign powers.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to modern policy, war is attend|ed with every de&s;tructive circum&s;tance; lo&s;s of men, encrea&s;e of taxes, decay of commerce, di&s;&s;i|pation of money, plunder by &s;ea and land. Ac|cording to antient maxims, the opening of the public trea&s;ure, as it produc'd an uncommon afflu|ence of gold and &s;ilver, &s;erv'd as a temporary en|couragement to indu&s;try, and aton'd, in &s;ome de|gree, for the inevitable calamities of war.</P>

WHAT then &s;hall we &s;ay to the new paradox, that public encumbrances are, of them&s;elves, ad|vantageous, independent of the nece&s;&s;ity of con|tracting them; and that any &s;tate, even tho' it were not pre&s;t by a foreign enemy, cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly have embrac'd a wi&s;er expedient for promoting commerce and riches, than to create funds and debts and taxes, without limitation?

<P>THERE is a word, which is here in the mouth of every body, and which, I find, has al&s;o got a|broad, and is much employ'd by foreign writers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Melon, Du Tot, Law,</HI> in the pamphlets, publi&s;h'd in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="127" REF="131">
in imitation of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that is CIRCULA|TION. This word &s;erves as an account of every thing; and tho' I confe&s;s, that I have &s;ought for its meaning in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, ever &s;ince I was a &s;chool-boy, I have never yet been able to di&s;co|ver it. What po&s;&s;ible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the ea&s;y transference of &s;tock from hand to hand? Or is there any para|lel to be drawn from the circulation of other com|modities, to that of chequer notes and <HI>India</HI> bonds? Where a manufacturer has a quick &s;ale of his goods to the merchant, the merchant to the &s;hop-keeper, the &s;hop-keeper to his cu&s;tomers; this enlivens in|du&s;try, and gives new encouragement to the fir&s;t dealer or the manufacturer and all his trade&s;men, and makes them produce more and better commo|dities of the &s;ame &s;pecies. A &s;tagnation is here pernicious, wherever it happens; becau&s;e it oper|ates backwards, and &s;tops or benumbs the indu&s;|trious hand in its production of what is u&s;eful to human life. But what production we owe to <HI>Change-alley,</HI> or even what con&s;umption, except that of coffee, and pen, ink and paper, I have not yet learn'd; nor can one fore&s;ee the lo&s;s or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity, tho' that place and all its inhabitants were for ever bury'd in the ocean.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this term, circulation, has never been explain'd by tho&s;e, who in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on the ad|vantages
<PB N="128" REF="132">
that re&s;ult from it, there &s;eems, however, to be &s;ome benefit of a &s;imilar kind, ari&s;ing from our incumbrances: As indeed, what human evil is there, which is not attended with &s;ome advantage?

<P>PUBLIC &s;ecurities are with us become a kind of money, and pa&s;s as readily at the current price as gold or &s;ilver. Wherever any profitable undertak|ing offers it&s;elf, however expen&s;ive, there are ne|ver wanting hands enow to embrace it; nor need a trader, who has &s;ums in the public &s;tocks, fear to launch out into the mo&s;t exten&s;ive trade; &s;ince he is po&s;&s;e&s;t of funds, which will an&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;ud|den demand that can be made upon him. No merchant thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to keep by him any con&s;iderable ca&s;h. Bank &s;tock, or <HI>India</HI> bonds, e&s;pecially the latter, &s;erve to all the &s;ame purpo|&s;es; becau&s;e he can di&s;po&s;e of them, or pledge them to a banker, in a quarter of an hour; and at the &s;ame time, they are not idle, even when in his &s;critoire, but bring him in a con&s;tant revenue. In &s;hort, our national debts furni&s;h merchants with a &s;pecies of money, that is continually multiplying in their hands, and produces &s;ure gain, be&s;ide the profits of their commerce. This mu&s;t enable them to trade upon le&s;s profit. The &s;mall profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper; cau&s;es a greater con&s;umption; quickens the labour of the
<PB N="129" REF="133">
common people; and helps to &s;pread arts and in|du&s;try thro' the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o, we may ob&s;erve, in <HI>England,</HI> and in all &s;tates, that have both commerce and pub|lic debts, a &s;et of men, who are half merchants, half &s;tock-holders, and may be &s;uppos'd willing to trade for &s;mall profits; becau&s;e commerce is not their principal or &s;ole &s;upport, and their revenues in the funds are a &s;ure re&s;ource for them&s;elves and their families. Were there no funds, great mer|chants wou'd have no expedient for realizing or &s;ecuring any part of their profit, but by making purcha&s;es of land; and land has many di&s;advanta|ges in compari&s;on of funds. Requiring more care and in&s;pection, it divides the time and attention of the merchant; upon any tempting offer or extra|ordinary accident in trade, it is not &s;o ea&s;ily con|verted into money; and as it attracts too much, both by the many natural plea&s;ures it affords, and the authority it gives, it &s;oon converts the citizen into the country gentleman. More men, there|fore, with large &s;tocks and incomes may naturally be &s;uppos'd to continue in trade, where there are public debts: And this, it mu&s;t be own'd, is of &s;ome advantage to commerce, by dimini&s;hing its profits, promoting circulation, and encouraging indu&s;try.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ON this head, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, without interrupting the thread of the argument, that the multiplicity of our public debts &s;erves rather to &s;ink the intere&s;t, and that the more the government bor|rows, the cheaper may they expect to borrow; contrary to fir&s;t appearance, and contrary to common opinion. The profits of trade have an influence on intere&s;t. See di&s;cour&s;e IV.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="134">
BUT in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e two favourable cir|cum&s;tances, perhaps of no very great importance, weigh the many di&s;advantages, that attend our public debts, in the whole <HI>interior</HI> oeconomy of the &s;tate: You will find no compari&s;on betwixt the ill and the good, that re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'TIS certain, that national debts cau&s;e a mighty confluence of people and riches to the ca|pital, by the great &s;ums, which are levy'd in the provinces to pay the intere&s;t of tho&s;e debts; and perhaps too, by the advantages in trade above men|tion'd, which they give the merchants in the ca|pital above the re&s;t of the kingdom. The que&s;tion is, whether, in our ca&s;e, it be for the public intere&s;t, that &s;o many privileges &s;hou'd be conferr'd on <HI>Lon|don,</HI> which has already arriv'd at &s;uch an enormous &s;ize, and &s;eems &s;till encrea&s;ing. Some men are apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences. For my part, I cannot forbear thinking, that tho' the head is un|doubtedly too big for the body, yet that great city is &s;o happily &s;ituated, that its exce&s;&s;ive bulk cau&s;es le&s;s inconvenience, than even a &s;maller capital to a greater kingdom. There is more difference be|twixt
<PB N="131" REF="135">
the prices of all provi&s;ions in <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lan|guedoc</HI> than betwixt tho&s;e in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> PUBLIC &s;tocks, being a kind of paper|credit, have all the di&s;advantages attending that &s;pecies of money. They bani&s;h gold and &s;ilver from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable commerce of the &s;tate, reduce them to common circulation, and by that means render all provi&s;ions and labour dearer than otherwi&s;e they wou'd be.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE taxes, which are levy'd to pay the intere&s;t of the&s;e debts, are a check upon indu&s;try, heighten the price of labour, and are an oppre&s;&s;ion on the poorer &s;ort.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As foreigners po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hare of our na|tional funds, they render the public, in a manner, tributary to them, and may in time occa&s;ion the tran&s;port of our people and our indu&s;try.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE greate&s;t part of public &s;tock being always in the hands of idle people, who live on their revenue, our funds give great encouragement to an u&s;ele&s;s and inactive life.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the injury, that ari&s;es to commerce and indu&s;try from our public funds, will appear, upon balancing the whole, very con&s;iderable, it is trivial in compari&s;on of the prejudice, that re&s;ults
<PB N="132" REF="136">
to the &s;tate, con&s;ider'd as a body politic, which mu&s;t &s;upport it&s;elf in the &s;ociety of nations, and have various tran&s;actions with other &s;tates, in wars and negotiations. The ill, there, is pure and unmixt, without any favourable circum&s;tance to atone for it: And 'tis an ill too, of a nature the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>WE have indeed been told, that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts; &s;ince they are mo&s;tly due among&s;t our&s;elves, and bring as much property to one as they take from another. 'Tis like transferring money from the right hand to the left; which leaves the per&s;on neither richer nor poorer than before. Such loo&s;e rea&s;onings and &s;pecious compari&s;ons will always pa&s;s, where we judge not upon principles. I ask, Is it po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, to overburthen a nation with taxes, even where the &s;overeign re&s;ides a|mong&s;t them? The very doubt &s;eems extravagant; &s;ince 'tis requi&s;ite, in every commonwealth, that there be a certain proportion ob&s;erv'd betwixt the laborious and the idle part of it. But if all our pre|&s;ent taxes be mortgag'd, mu&s;t we not invent new ones? And may not this matter be carry'd to a length, that is ruinous and de&s;tructive?</P>
<P>IN every nation, there are always &s;ome methods of levying money more ea&s;y than others, &s;uitable to the way of living of the people, and the commodi|ties
<PB N="133" REF="137">
they make u&s;e of. In <HI>Britain,</HI> the exci&s;es up|on malt and beer afford a very large revenue; be|cau&s;e the operations of malting and brewing are very tedious and are impo&s;&s;ible to be conceal'd; and at the &s;ame time, the&s;e commodities are not &s;o ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to life, as that the rai&s;ing their price wou'd very much affect the poorer &s;ort. The&s;e taxes being all mortgag'd, what difficulty to find new ones! What vexation and ruin of the poor!</P>
<P>DUTIES upon con&s;umptions are more equal and ea&s;y than tho&s;e upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. What a lo&s;s to the public, that the former are all exhau&s;ted, and that we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the more grievous method of levying taxes!</P>
<P>WERE all the proprietors of land only &s;tewards to the public; mu&s;t not nece&s;&s;ity force them to practi&s;e all the arts of oppre&s;&s;ion, us'd by &s;tewards, where the ab&s;ence and negligence of the proprietor render them &s;ecure again&s;t enquiry?</P>
<P>'TWILL &s;carce be a&s;&s;erted, that no bounds ought ever to be &s;et to national debts, and that the pub|lic wou'd be no weaker, were 12 or 15 &s;hillings in the pound, land tax, mortgag'd, along with all the pre&s;ent cu&s;toms and exci&s;es. There is &s;omething, therefore, in the ca&s;e, be&s;ide the mere transferring of property from one hand to another. In 500 years,

the po&s;terity of tho&s;e, now in the coaches, and of tho&s;e upon the boxes, will probably have chang'd places, without affecting the public by the&s;e revo|lutions.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that there is a &s;trange &s;upine|ne&s;s, from long cu&s;tom, crept into all ranks of men, with regard to public debts; not unlike what di|vines &s;o vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines. We all own, that the mo&s;t &s;anguine imagination cannot hope, either that this or any future mini&s;try will be po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;uch rigid and &s;teady frugality, as to make any con&s;ider|able progre&s;s in the payment of our debts, or that the &s;ituation of foreign affairs will, for any long time, allow them lei&s;ure and tranquillity, &s;ufficient for &s;uch an undertaking.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN times of peace and &s;ecurity, when alone it is po&s;&s;ible to pay debt, the money'd intere&s;t are aver&s;e to receive partial pay|ments, which they know not how to di&s;po&s;e of to advantage; and the landed intere&s;t are aver&s;e to continue the taxes requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e.

to form &s;ome conjectural &s;olution of. The events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles, negotiations, intrigues, and factions.

<P>THERE was, indeed, a &s;cheme for the payment of our debts, which was propos'd by an excellent citizen, Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> above 30 years ago, and which was much approv'd of by &s;ome men of &s;en&s;e, but never was likely to take effect. He a&s;&s;erted, that there was a fallacy in imagining, that the public ow'd this debt; for that really every individual ow'd a proportional &s;hare of it, and paid, in his taxes, a proportional &s;hare of the intere&s;t, be&s;ide the ex|pences of levying the&s;e taxes. Had we not better, then, &s;ays he, make a proportional di&s;tribution of the debt among&s;t us, and each of us contribute a
<PB N="136" REF="140">
&s;um &s;uitable to his property, and by that means, di&s;charge at once all our funds and public mort|gages? He &s;eems not to have con&s;ider'd, that the laborious poor pay a con&s;iderable part of the taxes by their annual con&s;umptions, tho' they cou'd not advance, at once, a proportional part of the &s;um re|quir'd. Not to mention, that property in money and &s;tock in trade might ea&s;ily be conceal'd or di&s;|guis'd; and that vi&s;ible property in lands and hou|&s;es wou'd really at la&s;t an&s;wer for the whole: An inequality and oppre&s;&s;ion, which never wou'd be &s;ubmitted to. But tho' this project is never likely to take place; 'tis not altogether improbable, that, when the nation become heartily &s;ick of their debts, and are cruelly oppre&s;t by them, &s;ome daring pro|jector may ari&s;e, with vi&s;ionary &s;chemes for their di&s;charge. And as public credit will begin, by that time, to be a little frail, the lea&s;t touch will de&s;troy it, as happen'd in <HI>France;</HI> and in this manner, it will <HI>dye of the doctor.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SOME neighbouring &s;tates practi&s;e an ea&s;y expedient, by which they lighten their public debts.

<P>BUT 'tis more probable, that the breach of na|tional faith will be the nece&s;&s;ary effect of wars, de|feats, misfortunes, and public calamities, or even perhaps of victories and conque&s;ts. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I &s;ee princes and &s;tates fighting and quarrel|ing, amid&s;t their debts, funds, and public mortgages, it always brings to my mind a match of cudgel|playing fought in a <HI>China</HI> &s;hop.

&s;elf-pre&s;ervation is unalienable in every individual, much more in every community.

But no more is requi&s;ite. The whole fabric, already tottering, falls to the ground, and buries thou&s;ands in its ruins.

The fear of an everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a needle&s;s bugbear. A prudent man, in reality, wou'd rather lend to the public imme|diately after they had taken a &s;punge to their debts than at pre|&s;ent; as much as an opulent knave, even tho' one cou'd not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an hone&s;t bankrupt: For the former, in order to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s, may find it his intere&s;t to di&s;charge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The latter has it not in his power.

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IX. <HI>Of &s;ome remarkable cu&s;toms.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SHALL ob&s;erve three remarkable cu&s;toms in three celebrated governments; and &s;hall con|clude from the whole, that all general maxims in politics ought to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd with great re&s;erve, and that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently di&s;cover'd, in the moral, as well as in the phy&s;ical world. The former, perhaps, we can better account for, after they happen, from &s;prings and principles, of which every one has, within him&s;elf, or from obvious ob&s;ervation, the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance and conviction: But 'tis often fully as impo&s;&s;ible for human prudence, before hand, to fore&s;ee and foretell them.</P>
<P N="1">I. ONE wou'd think it e&s;&s;ential to every &s;upreme council or a&s;&s;embly, which debates, that entire li|berty of &s;peech &s;hou'd be granted to every member, and that all motions or rea&s;onings &s;hou'd be re|ceiv'd, which can any way tend to illu&s;trate the point under deliberation. One wou'd conclude, with &s;till greater a&s;&s;urance, that, after a motion was made, which was voted and approv'd by that a&s;&s;embly, in which the legi&s;lature is lodg'd, the member, who made the motion, mu&s;t, for ever, be

exempted from farther trial and enquiry. But no political maxim can, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appear more undi&s;putable, than that he mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, be &s;e|cur'd from all inferior juri&s;diction; and that no|thing le&s;s, than the &s;ame &s;upreme legi&s;lative a&s;|&s;embly, in their &s;ub&s;equent meetings, cou'd render him accountable for tho&s;e motions and harangues, which they had before approv'd of. But the&s;e ax|ioms, however irrefragable they may appear, have all fail'd in the <HI>Athenian</HI> government, from cau&s;es and principles too, which appear almo&s;t inevitable.</P>
<P>BY the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>indictment of illegali|ty,</HI> (tho' it has not been remark'd by antiquaries or commentators) any man was try'd and puni&s;h'd, in a common court of judicature, for any law, which had pa&s;s'd upon his motion, in the a&s;&s;em|bly of the people, if that law appeared to the court unju&s;t or prejudicial to the public. Thus <HI>Demo|&s;thenes,</HI> finding that &s;hip money was levy'd irregu|larly, and that the poor bore the &s;ame burthen as the rich, in equipping the gallies, corrected this in|equality by a very u&s;eful law, which proportion'd the expence to the revenue and income of each in|dividual.

To e&s;tabli&s;h two di&s;tinct legi&s;latures, each of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es full and ab&s;olute authority within it&s;elf, and &s;tands in no need of the other's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to give vali|dity to its acts; this may appear, before hand, al|together impracticable, as long as men are actuat|ed by the pa&s;&s;ions of ambition, emulation, and ava|rice, which have been hitherto their chief govern|ing principles. And &s;hou'd I a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;tate I have in my eye was divided by two di&s;tinct fac|tions, each of which predominated in a di&s;tinct le|gi&s;lature, and yet produc'd no cla&s;hing of the&s;e in|dependent powers; the &s;uppo&s;ition may appear al|mo&s;t incredible. And if, to augment the paradox, I &s;hou'd affirm, that this disjointed, irregular go|vernment was the mo&s;t active, triumphant, and il|lu&s;trious commonwealth, that ever yet appear'd on
<PB N="149" REF="152">
the &s;tage of the world; I &s;hou'd certainly be told, that &s;uch a political chimera was as ab&s;urd as any vi&s;ion of the poets. But there is no need for &s;earch|ing long, in order to prove the reality of the fore|going &s;uppo&s;itions: For this was actually the ca&s;e with the <HI>Roman</HI> republic.</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lative power was there lodged both in the <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> and <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> In the former, 'tis well known, the people voted accord|ingly to their <HI>cen&s;us;</HI> &s;o that when the fir&s;t cla&s;s was unanimous, (as commonly happen'd) tho' it con|tain'd not, perhaps, the hundredth part of the com|monwealth, it determin'd the whole; and with the authority of the &s;enate, e&s;tabli&s;h'd a law. In the latter, every vote was alike; and as the authority of the &s;enate was not there requi&s;ite, the lower people entirely prevail'd, and gave law to the whole &s;tate. In all party divi&s;ions, at fir&s;t betwixt the <HI>Pa|tricians</HI> and <HI>Plebeians,</HI> afterwards betwixt the nobles and the people, the intere&s;t of the Ari&s;tocracy was predominant in the fir&s;t legi&s;lature; that of the De|mocracy in the &s;econd: The one cou'd always de|&s;troy what the other had e&s;tabli&s;h'd: Nay, the one, by a &s;udden and unfore&s;een motion, might take the &s;tart of the other; and totally annihilate its rival, by a vote, which, from the nature of the con&s;titu|tion, had the full authority of a law. But no &s;uch conte&s;t or &s;truggle is ob&s;erv'd in the hi&s;tory of <HI>Rome:</HI> No in&s;tance of a quarrel betwixt the&s;e two legi&s;la|tures;
<PB N="150" REF="153">
tho' many betwixt the parties, that govern'd in each. Whence aro&s;e this concord, which may &s;eem &s;o extraordinary?</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lature e&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the au|thority of <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> was the <HI>comitia centuri|ata,</HI> which, after the expul&s;ion of the kings, ren|der'd the government, for &s;ome time, altogether a|ri&s;tocratical. But the people, having numbers and force on their &s;ide, and being elated with frequent conque&s;ts and victories in their foreign wars, always prevail'd when pu&s;h'd to extremities, and fir&s;t ex|torted from the &s;enate the magi&s;tracy of the tri|bunes, and then the legi&s;lative power of the <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> It then behov'd the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people. For be&s;ide the force, which the latter were always po&s;|&s;e&s;t of, they had now got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of legal autho|rity, and cou'd in&s;tantly break in pieces any order or in&s;titution, which directly oppos'd them. By intrigue, by influence, by money, by combinati|on, and by the re&s;pect paid their character; the nobles might often prevail, and direct the whole machine of government: But had they openly &s;et their <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> in opo&s;ition to the <HI>tributa,</HI> they had &s;oon lo&s;t the advantage of that in&s;titution, along with their con&s;uls, praetors, ediles, and all the magi&s;trates elected by it. But the <HI>comitia tri|buta,</HI> not having the &s;ame rea&s;on for re&s;pecting the <HI>centuriata,</HI> frequently repeal'd laws favourable to
<PB N="151" REF="154">
the ari&s;tocracy: They limited the authority of the nobles; protected the people from oppre&s;&s;ion; and controul'd the actions of the &s;enate and magi&s;|tracy. The <HI>centuriata</HI> found it convenient always to &s;ubmit; and tho' equal in authority, yet being inferior in power, dur&s;t never directly give any &s;hock to the other legi&s;lature, either by repealing its laws, or e&s;tabli&s;hing laws, which, it fore&s;aw, wou'd &s;oon be repeal'd by it.</P>
<P>NO in&s;tance is found of any oppo&s;ition or &s;truggle betwixt the&s;e <HI>comitia;</HI> except one &s;light attempt of this kind, mention'd by <HI>Appian</HI> in the 3d book of his civil wars. <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> re&s;olving to deprive <HI>Decimus Brutus</HI> of the government of <HI>Ci&s;alpine Gaul,</HI> rail'd in the <HI>Forum,</HI> and call'd one of the <HI>comitia,</HI> in order to prevent the meeting of the o|ther, which had been order'd by the &s;enate. But affairs were then fallen into &s;uch confu&s;ion, and the <HI>Roman</HI> con&s;titution was &s;o near its la&s;t extremity, that no in&s;erence can be drawn from &s;uch an ex|pedient. This conte&s;t, be&s;ides, was founded more on form than party. 'Twas the &s;enate, who order'd the <HI>comitia tributa,</HI> that they might ob&s;truct the meeting of the <HI>centuriata,</HI> which, by the con&s;titu|tion, or at lea&s;t forms of the government, cou'd a|lone di&s;po&s;e of provinces.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> was recall'd by the <HI>comitia centuriata;</HI> tho' bani&s;h'd by the <HI>tributa,</HI> that is, by a <HI>plebi&s;citum:</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="155">
But his bani&s;hment, we may ob&s;erve, never was con&s;ider'd as a legal deed, ari&s;ing from the free choice and inclination of the people. It was al|ways a&s;crib'd to the violence alone of <HI>Clodius,</HI> and the di&s;orders introduc'd by him into the govern|ment.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>third</HI> cu&s;tom we propos'd to ob&s;erve regards <HI>England;</HI> and tho' it be not &s;o important as tho&s;e, which we have pointed out in <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> it is no le&s;s &s;ingular and remarkable. 'Tis a maxim in politics, which we readily admit as undi&s;puted and univer&s;al, that a power, how|ever great, when granted by law to an eminent magi&s;trate, is not &s;o dangerous to liberty, as an authority, however incon&s;iderable, which he ac|quires from violence and u&s;urpation. For be&s;ides that the law always limits every power, which it be&s;tows; the very receiving it as a conce&s;&s;ion e|&s;tabli&s;hes the authority whence it is deriv'd, and pre&s;erves the harmony of the con&s;titution. By the &s;ame right that one prerogative is a&s;&s;um'd without law, another may al&s;o be claim'd, and another, with &s;till greater facility: While the fir&s;t u&s;urpa|tions both &s;erve as precedents to the following, and give force to maintain them. Hence the heroi&s;m of <HI>Hampden,</HI> who &s;u&s;tain'd the whole violence of royal pro&s;ecution rather than pay a tax of 20 &s;hil|lings, not impos'd by parliament: Hence the care of all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> patriots to guard again&s;t the fir&s;t en|croachments
<PB N="153" REF="156">
of the crown: And hence alone the exi&s;tence, at this day, of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liberty.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one occa&s;ion, wherein the parliament has departed from this maxim; and that is, in the <HI>pre&s;&s;ing of &s;eamen.</HI> The exerci&s;e of an illegal power is here tacitly permitted in the crown; and tho' it has frequently been deliberat|ed on, how that power might be render'd legal, and under what re&s;trictions it might be granted to the &s;overeign, no &s;afe expedient cou'd ever be pro|pos'd for that purpo&s;e, and the danger to liberty always appear'd greater from law than from u&s;ur|pation. While this power is exercis'd to no other end than to man the navy, men willingly &s;ubmit to it, from a &s;en&s;e of its u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity; and the &s;ailors, who are alone affected by it, find no body to &s;upport them, in claiming the rights and privi|leges, which the law grants, without di&s;tinction, to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects. But were this power, on any occa&s;ion, made an in&s;trument of faction or mi|ni&s;terial tyranny, the oppo&s;ite faction, and indeed all lovers of their country, wou'd immediately take the alarm, and &s;upport the injur'd party: The liberty of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> wou'd be a&s;&s;erted: Juries wou'd be implacable; and the tools of tyranny, acting both again&s;t law and equity, wou'd meet with the &s;evere&s;t vengeance. On the other hand, were the parliament to grant &s;uch an authority, they wou'd probably fall into one of the&s;e two incon|veniencies: They wou'd either be&s;tow it under &s;o
<PB N="154" REF="157">
many re&s;trictions as wou'd make it lo&s;e its effects, by cramping the authority of the crown; or they wou'd render it &s;o large and comprehen&s;ive, as might give occa&s;ion to great abu&s;es, for which we cou'd, in that ca&s;e, have no remedy. The very illegality of the power, at pre&s;ent, prevents its a|bu&s;es, by affording &s;o ea&s;y a remedy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not, by this rea&s;oning, to exclude all po&s;&s;ibility of contriving a regi&s;ter for &s;eamen, which might mann the navy, without being dange|rous to liberty. I only ob&s;erve, that no &s;atisfac|tory &s;cheme of that nature has yet been propos'd. Rather than adopt any project hitherto invented, we continue a practice &s;eemingly the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and unaccountable.

<HEAD>DISCOURSE X. <HI>Of the Populou&s;ne&s;s of antient Nations.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AN eminent clergyman in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> having wrote, &s;ome years ago, a di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ame que&s;tion with this, of the popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of antient nations, was pleas'd lately to communicate it to the author. It maintain'd the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the argu|ment, to what is here in&s;i&s;ted on, and contained much erudition and good rea&s;oning. The author acknowledges to have borrow'd, with &s;ome variations, from that di&s;cour&s;e, two computations, that with regard to the number of inhabitants in <HI>Belgium,</HI> and that with regard to tho&s;e in <HI>Epirus.</HI> If this learned gentleman be pre|vail'd on to publi&s;h his differtation, it will &s;erve to give great light into the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, the mo&s;t curious and important of all que&s;tions of erudition.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THERE is very little ground, either from rea&s;on or experience, to conclude the uni|ver&s;e eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remark'd in the heavens, the plain traces, as well as traditi|on, of an univer&s;al deluge or general convul&s;ion of the elements; all the&s;e prove &s;trongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its pa&s;&s;age, by cor|ruption or di&s;&s;olution, from one &s;tate or order to an|other. It mu&s;t, therefore, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age, as well as each individual form, which it contains, and 'tis probable, that, in all the&s;e variations, man, equally with every animal
<PB N="156" REF="159">
and vegetable, will partake. In the flouri&s;hing age of the world, it may be expected, that the human &s;pecies &s;hou'd po&s;&s;e&s;s greater vigour both of mind and body, more pro&s;perous health, higher &s;pirits, longer life, and a &s;tronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general &s;y&s;tem of things, and human &s;ociety of cour&s;e, have any &s;uch gradu|al revolutions, they are too &s;low to be di&s;cernible in that &s;hort period, which is comprehended by hi&s;|tory and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, &s;eem hi|therto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the &s;ame. The arts and &s;ciences, indeed, have flouri&s;h'd in one period, and have decay'd in another: But we may ob&s;erve, that at the time when they ro&s;e to greate&s;t perfection among&s;t one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and tho' they univer&s;ally decay'd in one age, yet in a &s;ucceeding generation they again reviv'd, and diffus'd them&s;elves over the world. As far, therefore, as ob&s;ervation reaches, there is no univer&s;al difference di&s;cernible in the hu|man &s;pecies; and tho' it were allow'd, that the uni|ver&s;e, like an animal body, had a natural progre&s;s from infancy to old age, yet as it mu&s;t &s;till be uncertain, whether, at pre&s;ent, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence pre&s;uppo&s;e any decay in human nature. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collumela</HI> &s;ays, lib. 3. cap. 8. that in <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> the bearing of twins was frequent and even cu&s;tomary, <HI>gemini parties familiares, ac paene &s;olennes &s;unt.</HI> If this was true, there is a phy|&s;ical difference both in countries and ages. For travellers make no &s;uch remark of tho&s;e countries at pre&s;ent. On the contrary, we are apt to &s;uppo&s;e the northern nations more fertile. As tho&s;e two countries were provinces of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, it is difficult, tho' not altogether ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a man as <HI>Colu|mella</HI> might be mi&s;taken with regard to them.</NOTE> To

prove, therefore, or account for the greater popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of antiquity, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will &s;carce be admitted by any ju&s;t rea&s;oner. The&s;e <HI>general phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es ought entirely to be excluded from that que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;ome more <HI>particular phy&s;i|cal</HI> cau&s;es of great importance. Di&s;ea&s;es are men|tion'd in antiquity, which are almo&s;t unknown to modern medicine; and new di&s;ea&s;es have ari&s;en and propagated them&s;elves, of which there are no traces in ancient hi&s;tory. And in this particular, we may ob&s;erve, upon compari&s;on, that the di&s;ad|vantage is very much on the &s;ide of the moderns. Not to mention &s;ome others of le&s;s importance, the &s;mall pox commits &s;uch ravages, as would almo&s;t alone account for the great &s;uperiority &s;uppos'd in antient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, de&s;troy'd every generation, &s;hou'd make a va&s;t difference, it may be thought, in the num|bers of the people; and when join'd to venereal di&s;|tempers, a new plague diffus'd every where, this di&s;ea&s;e is perhaps equivalent, by its con&s;tant oper|ation, to the three great &s;courges of mankind, war,
<PB N="158" REF="161">
pe&s;tilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that antient times were more populous than the pre|&s;ent, and cou'd no moral cau&s;es be a&s;&s;ign'd for &s;o great a change; the&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es alone, in the opinion of many, wou'd be &s;ufficient to give us &s;a|tisfaction on that head.</P>
<P>BUT is it certain, that antiquity was &s;o much more populous, as is pretended? The extrava|gancies of <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> with regard to this &s;ubject, are well known: But an author of much greater ge|nius and di&s;cernment has ventur'd to affirm, that, according to the be&s;t computations, which the&s;e &s;ubjects will admit of, there are not now the fifti|eth part of mankind on the face of the earth, which exi&s;ted in the time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lettres Per&s;anes.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>L'E&s;prit des Loix liv.</HI> 23. chap. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> It may ea&s;i|ly be ob&s;erv'd, that the compari&s;ons, in this ca&s;e, mu&s;t be very imperfect; even tho' we confine our|&s;elves to the &s;cene of antient hi&s;tory, <HI>Europe</HI> and the nations about the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> We know not exactly the numbers of any <HI>European</HI> kingdom, or even city, at pre&s;ent: How can we pretend to calculate tho&s;e of antient cities and &s;tates, where hi&s;torians have left us &s;uch imperfect traces? For my part, the matter appears to me &s;o uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together &s;ome reflexi|ons on that head, I &s;hall intermingle the enquiry concerning <HI>cau&s;es</HI> with that concerning <HI>facts;</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="162">
which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be a&s;certain'd with any tolerable a&s;&s;urance. We &s;hall <HI>fir&s;t</HI> con&s;ider, whether it be probable, from what we know of the &s;ituation of &s;ociety in both periods, that antiquity mu&s;t have been more populous. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether in reality it was &s;o. If I can make appear, that the conclu&s;ion is not &s;o certain, as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, 'tis all I a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>IN general, we may ob&s;erve, that the que&s;tion with regard to the comparative populou&s;ne&s;s of ages or kingdoms implies very important con&s;equences, and commonly determines concerning the prefe|rence of their whole police, manners, and con&s;tituti|on of government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a de&s;ire and power of generation more active than is ever univer&s;ally exerted, the re|&s;traints, which it lyes under, mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome difficulties in mens &s;ituation, which it be|longs to a wi&s;e legi&s;lature carefully to ob&s;erve and remove. Almo&s;t every man, who thinks he can maintain a family, will have one; and the human &s;pecies, at this rate of propagation, wou'd more than double every generation, were every one coupled as &s;oon as he comes to the age of puberty. How fa&s;t do mankind multiply in every colony or new &s;ettle|ment; where it is an ea&s;y matter to provide for a family; and where men are no way &s;traitned or confin'd, as in long e&s;tabli&s;h'd governments? Hi|&s;tory
<PB N="160" REF="163">
tells us frequently of plagues, that have &s;wept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the de&s;truction was not per|ceiv'd; and the &s;ociety had again acquir'd their former number. The lands, that were cultivated, the hou&s;es built, the commodities rais'd, the riches acquir'd, enabled the people, who e&s;cap'd, imme|diately to marry, and to rear families, which &s;up|ply'd the place of tho&s;e who had peri&s;h'd. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THIS too is a good rea&s;on, why the &s;mall pox does not de|populate countries &s;o much as may at fir&s;t &s;ight be imagin'd. Where there is room for more people, they will always ari&s;e, even without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of naturalization bills. 'Tis remarkt by <HI>Don Geronimo de U&s;tariz,</HI> that the provinces of <HI>Spain,</HI> which &s;end mo&s;t people to the <HI>Indies,</HI> are mo&s;t populous; which pro|ceeds from their &s;uperior riches.</NOTE> And for a like rea&s;on, every wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and mild govern|ment, by rendering the condition of its &s;ubjects ea|&s;y and &s;ecure, will always abound mo&s;t in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, who&s;e climate and &s;oil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one, which produces only corn, and that more populous than one, which is only fitted for pa&s;turage. But if every thing el&s;e be equal, it &s;eems natural to expect, that whereever there are mo&s;t happine&s;s and virtue and the wi&s;e&s;t in&s;titutions, there will al&s;o be mo&s;t people.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion, therefore, concerning the popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of antient and modern times being allow'd of great importance, 'twill be requi&s;ite, if we wou'd
<PB N="161" REF="164">
bring it to &s;ome determination, to compare both the <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> and <HI>political</HI> &s;ituation of the&s;e two pe|riods, in order to judge of the facts by their moral cau&s;es; which is the fir&s;t view, in which we pro|pos'd to con&s;ider them.</P>
<P>THE chief difference betwixt the <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> oeco|nomy of the antients and that of the moderns con|&s;i&s;ts in the practice of &s;lavery, which prevail'd a|mong&s;t the former, and which has been aboli&s;h'd for &s;ome centuries throughout the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe.</HI> Some pa&s;&s;ionate admirers of the antients and zealous partizans of civil liberty (for the&s;e &s;en|timents, as they are both of them, in the main, extremely ju&s;t, are al&s;o found to be almo&s;t in&s;e|parable) cannot forbear regreting the lo&s;s of this in&s;titution; and whil&s;t they brand all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on, with the har&s;h denomination of &s;lavery, they wou'd gladly &s;ubject the greate&s;t part of mankind to real &s;lavery and &s;ubjection. But to one, who con&s;iders cooly of the &s;ubject, it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at pre&s;ent, in the mo&s;t arbitrary government of <HI>Europe,</HI> than it ever did during the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing period of antient times. As much as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a petty prince, who&s;e dominions extend not beyond a &s;ingle city, is more grievous than obedience to a great mon|arch; &s;o much is dome&s;tic &s;lavery more cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive than any civil &s;ubjection what&s;oever.
<PB N="162" REF="165">
The more the ma&s;ter is remov'd from us in place and rank, the greater liberty do we enjoy; the le&s;s are our actions in&s;pected and controul'd; and the fainter that cruel compari&s;on becomes betwixt our own &s;ubjection, and the freedom and even domi|nion of another. The remains, that are left of do|me&s;tic &s;lavery, in our colonies, and among&s;t &s;ome <HI>European</HI> nations, wou'd never &s;urely create a de|&s;ire o&s; rendering it more univer&s;al. The little hu|manity commonly ob&s;erv'd in per&s;ons, accu&s;tom'd, from their infancy, to exerci&s;e &s;o great authority over their fellow creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were &s;ufficient alone to di&s;gu&s;t us with that authority. Nor can a more probable rea|&s;on be given for the &s;evere, I might &s;ay, barbarous, manners of antient times, than the practice of do|me&s;tic &s;lavery; by which every man of rank was render'd a petty tyrant, and educated amid&s;t the flattery, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and low deba&s;ement of his &s;laves.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the antient practice, all checks were on the inferior, to re&s;train him to the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; none on the &s;uperior, to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentlene&s;s and humanity. In modern times, a bad &s;ervant finds not ea&s;ily a good ma&s;ter, nor a bad ma&s;ter a good &s;ervant; and the checks are mutual, &s;uitable to the inviolate and eternal laws of rea&s;on and equity.</P>

Who can read the accounts of the am|phitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is &s;ur|pris'd, that the emperors &s;hou'd treat that people in the &s;ame way the people treated their inferiors?

<P>BUT our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s is only to con&s;ider the influence of &s;lavery on the populou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;tate. 'Tis pretended, that, in this particular, the antient practice has infinitely the advantage, and was the the chief cau&s;e of that extreme populou&s;ne&s;s, which
<PB N="166" REF="169">
is &s;uppos'd in tho&s;e times. At pre&s;ent, all ma&s;ters di&s;courage the marrying of their male &s;ervants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then &s;uppos'd altogether incapacitated for their &s;ervice. But where the property of the &s;er|vants is lodg'd in the ma&s;ter, their marriage and &s;ertility form his riches, and bring him a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;laves that &s;upply the place of tho&s;e, whom age and infirmity have di&s;abled. He encourages, there|fore, their propagation, as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the &s;ame care; and educates them to &s;ome art or calling, which may render them more u&s;eful or valuable to him. The opu|lent are, by this policy, intere&s;ted in the being at lea&s;t, tho' not the well-being of the poor; and enrich them&s;elves by encrea&s;ing the number and indu&s;try of tho&s;e, who are &s;ubjected to them. Each man, being a &s;overeign in his own family, has the &s;ame intere&s;t with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the &s;tate; and has not, like the prince, any oppo&s;ite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little &s;ove|reignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has lei&s;ure to in&s;pect the mo&s;t minute de|tail of the marriage and education of his &s;ubjects. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WE may here ob&s;erve, that if dome&s;tic &s;lavery really encreas'd populou&s;ne&s;s, it wou'd be an exception to the general rule, that the happine&s;s of any &s;ociety and its populou&s;ne&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary atten|dants.

<P><PB N="167" REF="170">
SUCH are the con&s;equences of dome&s;tic &s;lavery, according to the fir&s;t a&s;pect and appearance of things: But if we enter deeper into the &s;ubject, we &s;hall perhaps find rea&s;on to retract our ha&s;ty deter|minations. The compari&s;on is &s;hocking betwixt the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely ju&s;t, when apply'd to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it may be proper to trace the con&s;equences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, indu&s;trious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provi&s;ions, lodging, atten|dance, labour are there dear; and men find better their account in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. The&s;e are con&s;equently the only breed|ing countries for cattle; and by a parity of rea&s;on, for men too, when the latter are put on the &s;ame footing with the former. To rear a child in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> till he cou'd be &s;erviceable, wou'd co&s;t much dearer, than to buy one of the &s;ame age from <HI>Scot|land</HI> or <HI>Ireland;</HI> where he had been rais'd in a cot|tage, cover'd with rags, and fed on oatmeal or po|tatoes. Tho&s;e who had &s;laves, therefore, in all the richer and more populous countries, wou'd di&s;|courage the pregnancy of the females, and either
<PB N="168" REF="171">
prevent or de&s;troy the birth. The human &s;pecies wou'd peri&s;h in tho&s;e places, where it ought to en|crea&s;e the fa&s;te&s;t; and a perpetual recruit be need|ed from all the poorer and more de&s;art provinces. Such a continu'd drain wou'd tend mightily to de|populate the &s;tate, and render great cities ten times more de&s;tructive than with us; where every man is ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, and provides for his children from the powerful in&s;tinct of nature, not the calculations of &s;ordid intere&s;t.

Perhaps, by an odd conexion of cau&s;es, the barbarous practice of the antients might ra|ther render tho&s;e times more populous.

OF all &s;ciences there is none, where fir&s;t ap|pearances are more deceitful than politics.

ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employ'd in them. The antients drew up their men 16 or 20, &s;ome|times 50 men deep, which made a narrow front; and 'twas not difficult to find a field, in which both armies might be mar&s;hall'd, and might engage with each other. Even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the battle was not &s;o &s;oon decided be|twixt the contending parties, but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties, that oppos'd them, and take part in the engagement.

<P>I GRANT, that agriculture is the &s;pecies of in|du&s;try, which is chiefly requi&s;ite to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of multitudes of people; and it is po&s;&s;ible, that this indu&s;try may flouri&s;h, even where manufactures and other arts are unknown or neglected. <HI>Swi&s;|&s;erland</HI> is at pre&s;ent a very remarkable in&s;tance; where we find, at once, the mo&s;t skilful husband|men and the mo&s;t bungling trade&s;men, that are to be met with in all <HI>Europe.</HI> That agriculture flou|ri&s;h'd mightily in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> at lea&s;t in &s;ome parts of them, and at &s;ome periods, we have rea|&s;on

to pre&s;ume: And whether the mechanical arts had reach'd the &s;ame degree of perfection may not be e&s;teem'd &s;o material; e&s;pecially, if we con&s;i|der the great equality in the antient republics, where each family was oblig'd to cultivate, with the greate&s;t care and indu&s;try, its own little field, in order to its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT is it ju&s;t rea&s;oning, becau&s;e agriculture may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, flouri&s;h without trade or manu|factures, to conclude that, in any great extent of country, and for any great tract of time, it wou'd &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone? The mo&s;t natural way, &s;urely, of en|couraging husbandry, is fir&s;t to excite other kinds of indu&s;try, and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities, and a return of &s;uch goods as may contribute to his plea&s;ure and enjoy|ment.

of men, and con&s;equently towards their propagation and encrea&s;e? Our &s;uperior &s;kill in mechanics, the di&s;covery of new worlds, by which commerce has been &s;o much enlarg'd, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of po&s;ts, and the u&s;e of bills of exchange; the&s;e &s;eem all extremely u&s;eful to the encourage|ment of art, indu&s;try, and populou&s;ne&s;s.

And it &s;eems not probable, that we cou'd &s;upply the place of the&s;e new inventions by any other regulation or in&s;titution.</P>
<P>HAVE we rea&s;on to think, that the police of an|tient &s;tates was any way comparable to that of modern, or that men had then equal &s;ecurity, either at home, or in their journeys by land or water? I que&s;tion not, but every impartial exami|ner wou'd give us the preference in this particular.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE e&s;&s;ays moral and political, e&s;&s;ay XV.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS upon comparing the whole, it &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any ju&s;t rea&s;on, why the world &s;hou'd have been more populous in antient than in modern times. The equality of property, a|mong&s;t the antients, liberty, and the &s;mall divi&s;i|ons of their &s;tates, were indeed favourable to the propagation of mankind: But their wars were more bloody and de&s;tructive; their governments
<PB N="211" REF="214">
more factious and un&s;ettl'd; commerce and ma|nufactures more feeble and langui&s;hing; and the general police more loo&s;e and irregular. The&s;e latter di&s;advantages &s;eem to form a &s;ufficient coun|ter-balance to the former advantages; and rather favour the oppo&s;ite opinion to that which common|ly prevails with regard to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT there is no rea&s;oning, it may be &s;aid, a|gain&s;t matter of fact. If it appear, that the world was then more populous than at pre&s;ent, we may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that our conjectures are fal&s;e, and that we have overlook'd &s;ome material circum&s;tance in the compari&s;on. This I readily own: All our preceding rea&s;onings, I acknowledge to be mere trifling, or, at lea&s;t, &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes and frivolous rencounters, that decide nothing. But unluckily the main combat, where we compare facts, can|not be render'd much more deci&s;ive. The facts deliver'd by antient authors are either &s;o uncertain or &s;o imperfect as to afford us nothing deci&s;ive in this matter. How indeed cou'd it be otherwi&s;e? The very facts, which we mu&s;t oppo&s;e to them, in computing the greatne&s;s of modern &s;tates, are far from being either certain or compleat. Many grounds of calculation, proceeded on by celebrat|ed writers, are little better than tho&s;e of the em|peror <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> who form'd an e&s;timate of the immen&s;e greatne&s;s of <HI>Rome,</HI> from ten thou&s;and

<P>'TIS to be remark'd, that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in antient manu&s;cripts, and have been &s;ubject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text; and that for a very obvious rea|&s;on. Any alteration in other places, commonly affects the &s;en&s;e or grammar, and is more readily perceiv'd by the reader and tran&s;criber.</P>
<P>FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any antient author of good authority; &s;o as to afford us a large enough view for compari&s;on.</P>
<P>'TIS probable, that there was formerly a good foundation for the numbers of citizens a&s;&s;igned to any free city; becau&s;e they enter'd for a &s;hare of the government, and there were exact regi&s;ters kept of them. But as the number of &s;laves is &s;eldom mention'd, this leaves us in as great uncertain|ty as ever, with regard to the populou&s;ne&s;s even of &s;ingle cities.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t page of <HI>Thucydides</HI> is, in my opinion, the commencement of real hi&s;tory. All preced|ing narrations are &s;o intermixt with fable, that phi|lo&s;ophers

<P>ALL the be&s;t manu&s;cripts of <HI>Pliny</HI> read the pa&s;&s;age as here cit|ed, and fix the compa&s;s of the walls of <HI>Rome</HI> to be 13 miles. The only que&s;tion is, what <HI>Pliny</HI> means by 30775 paces, and how that number was form'd. The manner, in which I conceive it, is this. <HI>Rome</HI> was a &s;emicircular area of 13 miles circumference. The <HI>Forum</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>Milliarium,</HI> we know, was &s;ituated on the Banks of the <HI>Tyber,</HI> and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the &s;emicircular area. Tho' there were 37 gates to <HI>Rome,</HI> yet only twelve of them had &s;treight &s;treets, leading from them to the <HI>Milliarium. Pliny,</HI> therefore, having a&s;&s;ign'd the cir|cumference of <HI>Rome,</HI> and knowing that that alone was not &s;uf|ficient to give in a ju&s;t notion of its &s;urface, u&s;es this farther me|thod. He &s;uppo&s;es all the &s;treets, leading from the <HI>Milliarium</HI> to the 12 gates, to be laid together into one &s;treight line, and &s;up|po&s;es we run along that line, &s;o as to count each gate once: In which ca&s;e, he &s;ays, that the whole line is 30775 paces: Or in other words, that each &s;treet or radius of the &s;emicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of <HI>Rome</HI> is 5 miles, and its breadth about half as much, be&s;ide the &s;catter'd &s;uburbs.</P>
<P><HI>Pere Hardouin</HI> under&s;tands this pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame manner; with regard to the laying together the &s;everal &s;treets of <HI>Rome</HI> into one line, in order to compo&s;e 30775 paces: But then he &s;up|po&s;es that &s;treets led from the <HI>Milliarium</HI> to every gate, and that no &s;treet exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1) a &s;emicir|cular area, who&s;e radius was only 800 paces, cou'd never have a circumference near 13 miles, the compa&s;s of <HI>Rome</HI> as a&s;&s;ign'd by <HI>Pliny.</HI> A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2) There is an ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing a city &s;o built as to have &s;treets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. The&s;e &s;treets mu&s;t interfere as they approach. (3) This dimini&s;hes too much from the greatne&s;s of antient <HI>Rome,</HI> and reduces that city below even <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> or <HI>Rotterdam.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e which <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> in his <HI>ob&s;ervationes variae</HI> puts on this pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Pliny,</HI> errs widely in the other extreme. One manu|&s;cript, of no authority, in&s;tead of 13 miles, has a&s;&s;ign'd 30 miles for the compa&s;s of the walls of <HI>Rome.</HI> And <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> under&s;tands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; &s;uppo&s;ing, that, as the <HI>Tyber</HI> form'd the diameter, there were no walls built on that &s;ide. But (1) this reading is allow'd contrary to almo&s;t all the manu&s;cripts. (2) Why &s;hou'd <HI>Pliny,</HI> a conci&s;e writer, re|peat the compa&s;s of the walls of <HI>Rome</HI> in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;enten|ces? (3) Why repeat it with &s;o &s;en&s;ible a variation? (4) What is the meaning of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s mentioning twice the <HI>Milliarium,</HI> if a line was mea&s;ur'd, that had no dependence on the <HI>Milliarium?</HI> (5) <HI>Aurelian</HI>'s wall is &s;aid by <HI>Vopi&s;cus</HI> to have been drawn <HI>laxiore ambitu,</HI> and to have comprehended all the buildings and &s;uburbs on the north-&s;ide of the <HI>Tyber;</HI> yet its compa&s;s was only 50 miles, and even here critics &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;take or corruption in the text. It is not probable that <HI>Rome</HI> wou'd dimini&s;h from <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI> to <HI>Aurelian.</HI> It remain'd &s;till the capital of the &s;ame em|pire; and none of the civil wars, in that long period, except the tumults on the death of <HI>Maximus</HI> and <HI>Balbinus,</HI> ever affected the city. <HI>Caracalla</HI> is &s;aid by <HI>Aurelius Victor</HI> to have encreas'd <HI>Rome.</HI> (6) There are no remains of antient buildings, which mark any &s;uch greatne&s;s of <HI>Rome. Vo&s;&s;ius</HI>'s reply to this objection &s;eems ab&s;urd, that the rubbi&s;h wou'd &s;ink 60 or 70 foot below ground. It appears from <HI>Spartian (in vita Severi)</HI> that the five mile &s;tone <HI>in via Lavicana</HI> was out of the city. (7) <HI>Olympiodorus</HI> and <HI>Pub|lius Victor</HI> fix the number of hou&s;es in <HI>Rome</HI> to be betwixt forty and fifty thou&s;and. (8) The very extravagance of the con&s;equences, drawn by this critic, as well as <HI>Lip&s;ius,</HI> if they be nece&s;&s;ary, de|&s;troys the foundation on which they are grounded: That <HI>Rome</HI> contain'd 14 millions of inhabitants; while the whole kingdom of <HI>France</HI> contains only five, according to his computation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE only objection to the &s;en&s;e, which we have affix'd above to the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Pliny,</HI> &s;eems to lye in this, that <HI>Pliny,</HI> after mentioning the 37 gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> a&s;&s;igns only a rea&s;on for &s;uppre&s;&s;|ing the &s;even old ones, and &s;ays nothing of the 18 gates, the &s;treets leading from which, terminated, according to my opinion, before they reach'd the Forum. But as <HI>Pliny</HI> was writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who perfectly knew the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;treets, it is not &s;trange he &s;hou'd take a circum&s;tance for granted, which was &s;o familiar to every body. Perhaps too, many of the&s;e gates led to wharfs upon the river.</P></NOTE> his own way, without admitting

<P>THE number of citizens, who receiv'd corn by the public di&s;tribution in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s time,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex monument. Ancyr.</NOTE> were 200,000. This one wou'd e&s;teem a pretty certain ground of calculation: Yet is it attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances as throw us back into doubt and un|certainty.</P>
<P>Did the poorer citizens only receive the di&s;tri|bution? It was calculated, to be &s;ure, chiefly for their benefit. But it appears from a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Cicero,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tu&s;c. quae&s;t.</HI> lib. 3. cap. 48.</NOTE> that the rich might al&s;o take their porti|on, and that it was e&s;teem'd no reproach in them to apply for it.</P>
<P>TO whom was the corn given; whether only to heads of families, or to every man, woman and child? The portion every month was five <HI>mo|dii</HI> to each <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Licinius apud Sallu&s;t. hi&s;t. frag.</HI> lib. 3.</NOTE> (about &frac56; of a bu&s;hel.) This was too little for a family, and too much for an individual.
<PB N="235" REF="238">

<P>WAS it &s;trictly enquir'd, whether the claimant liv'd within the precincts of <HI>Rome,</HI> or was it &s;uffi|cient, that he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the monthly di&s;|tribution?

<P>BUT la&s;tly, what proportion of &s;laves mu&s;t we a&s;&s;ign to the&s;e citizens? This is the mo&s;t material que&s;tion; and the mo&s;t uncertain.

<P>We learn from <HI>Vopi&s;cus,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Aurelian.</HI> cap. 48.</NOTE> that there was in <HI>E|truria</HI> much fertile land uncultivated; which the emperor, <HI>Aurelian,</HI> intended to convert into vine|yards, in order to furni&s;h the <HI>Roman</HI> people with a gratuitous di&s;tribution of wine: A very proper ex|pedient to di&s;people &s;till farther that capital and all the neighbouring territories.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to take notice of the ac|count, which <HI>Polybius</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">LIB. 12. cap. 2.</NOTE> gives of the great herds of &s;wine to be met with in <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> and <HI>Lombardy,</HI> as well as in <HI>Greece,</HI> and of the method of feeding them which was then practis'd. <Q>There are great herds of &s;wine, (&s;ays he) throughout all <HI>Italy,</HI> particularly, in former times, thro' <HI>Etru|ria</HI> and <HI>Ci&s;alpine Gaul.</HI> And a herd frequently contains a thou&s;and or more &s;wine. When one of
<PB N="240" REF="243">
the&s;e herds in feeding meets with another, they mix together; and the &s;wine-herds have no o|ther expedients to &s;eparate them than to go to different quarters, where they &s;ound their horn; and the&s;e animals, being accu&s;tom'd to that &s;ig|nal, run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper. Whereas in <HI>Greece,</HI> if the herds of &s;wine happen to mix in the fore&s;ts, he, who has the greate&s;t flock, takes cunningly the op|portunity of driving all away.

<P>MAY we not infer from this account, that the North of <HI>Italy</HI> was then much le&s;s peopled, and wor&s;e cultivated than at pre&s;ent?

'Tis wrote in dialogue, which is a method of compo&s;ition, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> commonly little affects.

<HEAD>DISCOURSE XI. <HI>Of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SUPPOSE, that a member of parliament, in the reign of king <HI>William</HI> or queen <HI>Anne,</HI> while the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> was yet uncertain, were deliberating concerning the party he wou'd chu&s;e in that important que&s;tion, and weighing, with impartiality, the advantages and di&s;advantages on each &s;ide. I believe the follow|ing particulars wou'd have enter'd into his con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>HE wou'd ea&s;ily perceive the great advantages, re&s;ulting from the re&s;toration of the <HI>Stuart</HI> family; by which we &s;hou'd pre&s;erve the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion clear and undi&s;puted, free from a pretender, with &s;uch a &s;pecious title as that of blood, which, with the multitude, is always the claim, the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily comprehended. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay, as many have done, that the que&s;tion with regard to <HI>governors,</HI> independent of <HI>government,</HI> is frivolous, and little worth di&s;puting, much le&s;s fighting about. The generality of mankind never will enter into the&s;e &s;entiments; and 'tis much happier, I believe, for &s;ociety, that they do not, but continue in their natural prejudices and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. How cou'd

&s;tability be pre&s;erv'd in any monarchical govern|ment (which, tho', perhaps, not the be&s;t, is, and always has been the mo&s;t common of any) unle&s;s men had &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family; and even tho' weak in under|&s;tanding, or infirm in years, gave him &s;o great a preference above per&s;ons, the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd in &s;hining talents, or celebrated for great atchieve|ments? Wou'd not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy, or even without any va|cancy; and the kingdom become the theatre of perpetual wars and convul&s;ions? The condition of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, &s;urely, was not, in this re|&s;pect, much to be envy'd; nor is that of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> nations, who pay little regard to the title of their &s;overeigns, but &s;acrifice them, every day, to the caprice or momentary humour of the populace or &s;oldiery. 'Tis but a fooli&s;h wi&s;dom, which is &s;o carefully di&s;play'd, in undervaluing princes, and placing them on a level with the meane&s;t of man|kind. To be &s;ure, an anatomi&s;t finds no more in the greate&s;t monarch than in the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant or day-labourer; and a morali&s;t may, perhaps, fre|quently find le&s;s.

gentlemen, wou'd pre&s;ently di&s;gu&s;t us; but one, that introduces kings and princes, acquires in our eyes an air of importance and dignity. Or &s;hou'd a man be able, by his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, to get en|tirely above &s;uch prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he wou'd &s;oon, by means of the &s;ame wi&s;dom, again bring him&s;elf down to them; for the &s;ake of &s;ociety, who&s;e wel|fare he wou'd perceive to be intimately connected with them. Far from endeavouring to undeceive the people in this particular, he wou'd cheri&s;h and fo&s;ter &s;uch &s;entiments of reverence to their prin|ces; as requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve a due &s;ubordination in &s;ociety. And tho' the lives of twenty thou&s;and men be often &s;acrific'd to maintain a king in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his throne, or pre&s;erve the right of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion undi&s;turbed, he entertains no indignation at the lo&s;s; on pretence that every individual of the&s;e was, perhaps, in him&s;elf, as valuable as the prince he &s;erv'd.

<P>THE advantages of the <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are of an oppo&s;ite nature, and ari&s;e from this very cir|cum&s;tance, that it violates hereditary right, and places on the throne a prince, to whom birth gave no title to that dignity. 'Tis evident to any one,
<PB N="266" REF="268">
who con&s;iders the hi&s;tory of this i&s;land, that the privileges of the people have, during the two la&s;t centuries, been continually upon the encrea&s;e, by the divi&s;ion of the church lands, by the alienations of the barons e&s;tates, by the progre&s;s of trade, and above all, by the happine&s;s of our &s;ituation, which, for a long time, gave us &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, with|out any &s;tanding army or military e&s;tabli&s;hment.

They were encourag'd in this mi&s;take, by the ex|ample of all the neighbouring princes, who, bear|ing the &s;ame title or appellation, and being adorn'd with the &s;ame en&s;igns of authority, naturally led them to claim the &s;ame powers and prerogatives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>IT appears from the &s;peeches, and proclamations, and whole train of king <HI>James</HI> the I.

By electing him in the royal line, we cut off all hopes of ambitious &s;ubjects, who might, in future emergencies, di&s;turb the go|vernment by their cabals and preten&s;ions: By ren|dering the crown hereditary in his family, we a|voided all the inconveniencies of elective monar|chy: And by excluding the lineal heir, we &s;ecur'd all our con&s;titutional limitations, and render'd our government uniform and of a piece. The people cheri&s;h monarchy, becau&s;e protected by it: The monarch favours liberty, becau&s;e created by it. And thus every advantage is obtain'd by the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, as far as human &s;kill and wi&s;dom can extend it&s;elf.</P>

<P>THE di&s;advantages of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;t in the foreign dominions, which are po&s;&s;e&s;t by the princes of the <HI>Hanover</HI> line, and which, it might be &s;uppos'd, wou'd engage us in the in|trigues and wars of the continent, and lo&s;e us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the ine&s;timable advantage we po&s;|&s;e&s;s, of being &s;urrounded and guarded by the &s;ea, which we command. The di&s;advantages of re|calling the abdicated family con&s;i&s;t chiefly in their religion, which is more prejudicial to &s;ociety than that e&s;tabli&s;h'd among&s;t us, is contrary to it, and affords no toleration or peace or &s;ecurity to any o|ther religion.</P>
<P>IT appears to me, that all the&s;e advantages and di&s;advantages are allow'd on both &s;ides; at lea&s;t, by every one, who is at all &s;u&s;ceptible of argument or rea&s;oning. No &s;ubject, however loyal, pretends to deny, that the di&s;puted title and foreign domi|nions of the pre&s;ent royal family are a lo&s;s; nor is there any partizan of the <HI>Stuart</HI> family, but will confe&s;s, that the claim of hereditary, indefea&s;ible right, and the <HI>Roman</HI> catholick religion are al&s;o di&s;|advantages

in that family. It belongs, therefore, to a philo&s;opher alone, who is of neither party, to put all the&s;e circum&s;tances in the &s;cale, and a&s;&s;ign to each of them its proper poize and influence. Such an one will readily, at fir&s;t, acknowledge, that all political que&s;tions are infinitely complicat|ed; and that there &s;carce ever occurs, in any de|liberation, a choice, which is either purely good, or purely ill. Con&s;equences, mix'd and vary'd, may be fore&s;een to flow from every mea&s;ure: And many con&s;equences, unfore&s;een, do always, in fact, re&s;ult from it. He&s;itation, and re&s;erve, and &s;u&s;|pence are, therefore, the only &s;entiments he brings to this e&s;&s;ay or trial. Or if he indulges any pa&s;&s;i|on, 'tis that of deri&s;ion and ridicule again&s;t the ig|norant multitude, who are always clamorous and dogmatical, even in the nice&s;t que&s;tions, of which, from want of temper, perhaps &s;till more than of under&s;tanding, they are altogether unfit judges.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;ay &s;omething more determinate on this head; the following reflections will, I hope, &s;how the temper, if not the under&s;tanding of a philo&s;o|pher.</P>
<P>WERE we to judge merely by fir&s;t appearance, and by pa&s;t experience, we mu&s;t allow, that the advantages of a parliamentary title in the hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> are much greater than tho&s;e of an undi&s;|puted hereditary title in the hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart;</HI> and
<PB N="271" REF="273">
that our fathers acted wi&s;ely in preferring the for|mer to the latter. So long as the hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart</HI> reign'd in <HI>Britain,</HI> which, with &s;ome interrupti|ons, was above 80 years, the government was kept in a continual fever, by the contentions betwixt the privileges of the people and the prerogatives of the crown. If arms were dropt, the noi&s;e of di&s;|putes continu'd: Or if the&s;e were &s;ilenc'd, jea|lou&s;y &s;till corroded the heart, and threw the nati|on into an unnatural ferment and di&s;order. And while we were thus occupy'd in dome&s;tic conten|tions, a foreign power, dangerous, if not fatal, to public liberty, erected it&s;elf in <HI>Europe,</HI> without a|ny oppo&s;ition from us, and even &s;ometimes with our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT within the&s;e la&s;t &s;ixty years, when a par|liamentary e&s;tabli&s;hment has taken place; whate|ver factions may have prevail'd either among&s;t the people or in public a&s;&s;emblies; the whole force of our con&s;titution has always fallen to one &s;ide, and an uninterrupted harmony has been pre&s;erv'd be|twixt our princes and our parliaments. Public li|berty, with internal peace and order, has flouri&s;h'd, almo&s;t without interruption: Trade and manufac|tures and agriculture have encreas'd: The arts and &s;ciences and philo&s;ophy have been cultivated: E|ven religious parties have been nece&s;&s;itated to lay a&s;ide their mutual rancour: And the glory of the nation has &s;pread it&s;elf all over <HI>Europe;</HI> while we
<PB N="272" REF="274">
&s;tand the bulwark again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and the great antagoni&s;t of that power, which threatens every people with conque&s;t and &s;ubjection. So long and &s;o glorious a period no nation almo&s;t can boa&s;t of; nor is there another in&s;tance, in the whole hi&s;tory of mankind, that &s;o many millions of people have, during &s;uch a &s;pace of time, been held together, in a manner &s;o free, &s;o rational, and &s;o &s;uitable to the dignity of human nature.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this recent in&s;tance &s;eems clearly to decide in favour of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, there are &s;ome circum&s;tances to be thrown into the o|ther &s;cale; and 'tis dangerous to regulate our judg|ment by one event or example.</P>
<P>WE have had two rebellions during the flouri&s;h|ing period above mention'd; be&s;ides plots and con|&s;piracies without number. And if none of the&s;e have produc'd any very fatal event, we may a&s;cribe our e&s;cape chiefly to the narrow genius of tho&s;e princes, who di&s;puted our e&s;tabli&s;hment; and may e&s;teem our&s;elves &s;o far fortunate. But the claims of the bani&s;h'd family, I fear, are not yet antiquat|ed; and who can foretel, that their future attempts will produce no greater di&s;order?</P>
<P>THE di&s;putes betwixt privilege and prerogative may ea&s;ily be compos'd by laws, and votes, and conferences, and conce&s;&s;ions; where there is toler|able

temper or prudence on both &s;ides, or on ei|ther &s;ide. Among&s;t contending titles, the que&s;ti|on can only be determin'd by the &s;word, and by deva&s;tation, and by civil war.</P>
<P>A PRINCE, who fills the throne with a di&s;puted title dares not arm his &s;ubjects; the only method of &s;ecuring a people fully, both again&s;t dome&s;tic oppre&s;&s;ion and foreign conque&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all our riches and re|nown, what a critical e&s;cape did we lately make, from dangers, which were owing not &s;o much to bad conduct and ill &s;ucce&s;s in war, as to the pernicious practice of mortgaging our finances, and the &s;till more pernicious maxim of never paying off our in|cumbrances. Such fatal mea&s;ures cou'd never have been embrac'd, had it not been to &s;ecure a preca|rious e&s;tabli&s;hment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THOSE who con&s;ider how univer&s;al this pernicious practice of funding has become all over <HI>Europe</HI> may perhaps di&s;pute this la&s;t opinion. But we lay under le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity than other &s;tates.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT to convince us, that an hereditary title is to be embrac'd rather than a parliamentary one, which is not &s;upported by any other views or mo|tives; a man needs only tran&s;port him&s;elf back to the aera of the re&s;toration, and &s;uppo&s;e, that he had had a &s;eat in that parliament, which recall'd the royal family, and put a period to the greate&s;t di&s;|orders

that ever aro&s;e from the oppo&s;ite preten&s;i|ons of prince and people. What wou'd have been thought of one, that had propos'd, at that time, to &s;et a&s;ide <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, and &s;ettle the crown on the duke of <HI>York</HI> or <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> merely, in or|der to exclude the high claims of their father and grandfather? Wou'd not &s;uch an one have been re|garded as a very extravagant projector, who lov'd dangerous remedies, and cou'd tamper and play with a government and national con&s;titution, like a quack with a &s;ickly patient?</P>
<P>THE advantages, which re&s;ult from a parlia|mentary title, preferably to an hereditary one, tho' they are great, are too refin'd ever to enter into the conception of the vulgar. The bulk of man|kind wou'd never allow them to be &s;ufficient for committing what wou'd be regarded as an inju&s;tice to the prince. They mu&s;t be &s;upported by &s;ome gro&s;s, popular, and familiar topics; and wi&s;e men, tho' convinc'd of their force, wou'd reject them, in compliance with the weakne&s;s and prejudices of the people. An encroaching tyrant or deluded bi|got alone, by his mi&s;conduct, is able to enrage the nation, and render practicable what was always, perhaps, de&s;irable.</P>
<P>IN reality, the rea&s;on a&s;iign'd by the nation for excluding the race of <HI>Stuart,</HI> and &s;o many other branches of the royal family, is not on account of
<PB N="275" REF="277">
their hereditary title (which however ju&s;t in it&s;elf, wou'd, to vulgar apprehen&s;ions, have appear'd al|together ab&s;urd) but on account of their religion: Which leads us to compare the di&s;advantages above mention'd of each e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, that, con&s;idering the matter in ge|neral, it were rather to be wi&s;h'd, that our prince had no foreign dominions, and cou'd confine all his attention to the government of this i&s;land. For not to mention &s;ome real inconveniencies, that may re&s;ult from territories on the continent; they afford &s;uch a handle for calumny and defamation, as is greedily &s;eiz'd by the people, who are always di&s;pos'd to think ill of their &s;uperiors. It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledg'd, that <HI>Hanover</HI> is, per|haps, the &s;pot of ground in <HI>Europe</HI> the lea&s;t incon|venient for a king of <HI>Britain.</HI> It lyes in the heart of <HI>Germany,</HI> at a di&s;tance from the great powers, which are our natural rivals: It is protected by the laws of the empire, as well as by the arms of its own &s;overeign: And it &s;erves only to connect us more clo&s;ely with the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which is our natural ally.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t war, it has been of &s;ervice to us, by furni&s;hing us with a con&s;iderable body of auxiliary troops, the brave&s;t and mo&s;t faithful in the world. The elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> is the only con&s;iderable prince in the empire, who has drove no &s;eparate
<PB N="276" REF="278">
end, and has rais'd up no &s;tale preten&s;ions, during the late commotions of <HI>Europe;</HI> but has acted, all along, with the dignity of a king of <HI>Britain.</HI> And ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of that family, 'twou'd be difficult to &s;how any harm we have ever receiv'd from the electoral dominions, except that &s;hort di&s;gu&s;t in 1718, with <HI>Charles</HI> the twelfth, who, regulating him&s;elf by maxims very different from tho&s;e of other princes, made a per&s;onal quarrel of every public injury.</P>
<P>THE religious per&s;ua&s;ion of the hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart</HI> is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye, and wou'd threaten us with much more di&s;mal con&s;e|quences. The <HI>Roman</HI> catholic religion, with its huge train of prie&s;ts and friers, is va&s;tly more ex|pen&s;ive than ours: Even tho' unaccompany'd with its natural attendants of inqui&s;itors and &s;takes and gibbets, it is le&s;s tolerating: And not contented with dividing the &s;acerdotal from the regal office, (which mu&s;t be prejudicial to any &s;tate) it be&s;tows the former on a foreigner, who has always a &s;epa|rate, and may often have an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t to that of the public.</P>
<P>BUT were this religion ever &s;o advantageous to &s;ociety, it is contrary to that which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd among us, and which is likely to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for a long time, of the minds of the people. And tho' it is much to be hop'd, that the progre&s;s of rea|&s;on
<PB N="277" REF="279">
and philo&s;ophy will, by degrees, abate the vi|rulent acrimony of oppo&s;ite religious all over <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> yet the &s;pirit of moderation has, as yet, made too &s;low advances to be entirely tru&s;ted. The conduct of the <HI>Saxon</HI> family, where the &s;ame per|&s;on can be a catholic king and a prote&s;tant elector, is, perhaps, the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in modern times, of &s;o rea&s;onable and prudent a behaviour. And the gradual progre&s;s of the catholic &s;uper&s;tition does, even there, progno&s;ticate a &s;peedy alteration: Af|ter which, 'tis ju&s;tly to be apprehended, that per|&s;ecutions will put a &s;peedy period to the prote&s;tant religion in the place of its nativity.</P>
<P>THUS, upon the whole, the advantages of the &s;ettlement in the family of <HI>Stuart,</HI> which frees us from a di&s;puted title, &s;eem to bear &s;ome proporti|on with tho&s;e of the &s;ettlement in the family of <HI>Hanover,</HI> which frees us from the claims of prero|gative: But at the &s;ame time, its di&s;advantages, by placing on the throne a <HI>Roman</HI> catholic, are much greater than tho&s;e of the other e&s;tabli&s;hment, in &s;ettling the crown on a foreign prince. What party an impartial patriot, in the reign of king <HI>William</HI> or queen <HI>Anne,</HI> wou'd have cho&s;en a|mid&s;t the&s;e oppo&s;ite views, may, perhaps, to &s;ome appear hard to determine. For my part, I e&s;teem liberty &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing in &s;ociety, that what|ever favours its progre&s;s and &s;ecurity, can &s;carce
<PB N="278" REF="280">
be too fondly cheri&s;h'd by every one, who is a lo|ver of human kind.</P>
<P>BUT, the &s;ettlement in the hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> has actually taken place. The princes of that family, without intrigue, without cabal, without &s;ollicita|tion on their part, have been call'd to mount our throne, by the united voice of the whole legi&s;lative body. They have, &s;ince their acce&s;&s;ion, di&s;play'd, in all their actions, the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s, equity, and regard to the laws and con&s;titution. Our own mini&s;ters, our own parliaments, our&s;elves have go|vern'd us; and if aught ill has befallen us, we can only blame fortune or our&s;elves. What a reproach mu&s;t we become among&s;t nations, if, di&s;gu&s;ted with a &s;ettlement &s;o deliberately made, and who&s;e conditions have been &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, we &s;hou'd throw every thing again into confu&s;ion; and by our levity and rebellious di&s;po&s;ition, prove our|&s;elves totally unfit for any &s;tate but that of ab&s;o|lute &s;lavery and &s;ubjection?</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t inconvenience attending a di&s;put|ed title is, that it brings us in danger of civil wars and rebellions. What wi&s;e man, to avoid this in|convenience, wou'd run directly upon a civil war and rebellion? Not to mention, that &s;o long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ecur'd by &s;o many laws, mu&s;t, e're this time, in the apprehen&s;ion of a great part of the nation, have begot a title in the hou&s;e of <HI>Hano|ver,</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="281">
independent of their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: So that now we &s;hou'd not even, by a revolution, obtain the end, of avoiding a di&s;puted title.</P>
<P>No revolution, made by national forces, will e|ver be able, without &s;ome other great nece&s;&s;ity, to aboli&s;h our debts and incumbrances, in which the intere&s;t of &s;o many per&s;ons is concern'd. And a revolution, made by foreign forces, is a conque&s;t: A calamity, with which the precarious balance of power very nearly threatens us, and which our ci|vil di&s;&s;en&s;ions are likely, above all other circum|ces, to bring &s;uddenly upon us.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE XII. <HI>Idea of a perfect Commonwealth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all mankind, there are none &s;o pernicious as political projectors, if they have power; nor &s;o ridiculous, if they want it: As on the other hand, a wi&s;e politician is the mo&s;t beneficial cha|racter in nature, if accompany'd with authority, and the mo&s;t innocent, and not altogether u&s;ele&s;s, even if depriv'd of it. 'Tis not with forms of go|vernment, as with other artificial contrivances; where an old engine may be rejected, if we can di&s;|cover another more accurate and commodious, or where trials may &s;afely be made, even tho' the &s;uc|ce&s;s be doubtful. An e&s;tabli&s;h'd government has an infinite advantage, by that very circum&s;tance of its being e&s;tabli&s;h'd; the bulk of mankind being govern'd by authority, not rea&s;on, and never attri|buting authority to any thing, that has not the re|commendation of antiquity. To tamper, therefore, in this affair, or try projects, merely upon the cre|dit of &s;uppos'd argument and philo&s;ophy, can ne|ver be the part of a wi&s;e magi&s;trate, who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age; and tho' he may attempt &s;ome improvement for the public good, yet will he adju&s;t his innovations, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the antient fabric, and pre|&s;erve
<PB N="282" REF="283">
entire the chief pillars and &s;upports of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE mathematicians in <HI>Europe</HI> have been much divided concerning that figure of a &s;hip, which is the mo&s;t commodious for &s;ailing; and <HI>Huygens,</HI> who at la&s;t fixt this controver&s;y, is ju&s;tly thought to have oblig'd the learned, as well as commerci|al world; tho' <HI>Columbus</HI> had &s;ail'd to <HI>America,</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> made the tour of the world, without any &s;uch di&s;covery. As one form of go|vernment mu&s;t be allow'd more perfect than ano|ther, independent of the manners and humours of particular men; Why may we not enquire what is the mo&s;t perfect of all, tho' the common botcht and inaccurate governments &s;eem to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of &s;ociety, and tho' it be not &s;o ea&s;y to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a new government as to build a ve&s;&s;el upon a new plan? The &s;ubject is &s;urely the mo&s;t worthy curio&s;ity, of any the wit of man can po&s;&s;ibly de|vi&s;e. And who knows, if this controver&s;y were fixt by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the learned, but in &s;ome future age an opportunity might be afford|ed of reducing the theory to practice, either by a di&s;&s;olution of the old governments, or the combi|nation of men to form a new one, in &s;ome di&s;tant part of the world? In all ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be advan|tageous to know what is mo&s;t perfect in the kind, that we may be able to bring any real con&s;titution or form of government as near it as po&s;&s;ible, by
<PB N="283" REF="284">
&s;uch gentle alterations and innovations, as may not give too great di&s;turbance to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ALL I'pretend to in the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay is to re|vive this &s;ubject of &s;peculation; and therefore I &s;hall deliver my &s;entiments in as few words as po&s;|&s;ible. A long di&s;&s;ertation on that head wou'd not, I apprehend, be very acceptable to the pub|lic, who will be apt to regard &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions, both as u&s;ele&s;s and chimerical.</P>
<P>ALL plans of government, which &s;uppo&s;e great reformation in the manners of mankind, are plain|ly imaginary. Of this nature, are the republic of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the <HI>Utopia</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas More.</HI> The <HI>Oceana</HI> is the only valuable model of a common|wealth, that has yet been offer'd to the public.</P>
<P>THE chief defects of the <HI>Oceana</HI> &s;eem to be the&s;e. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Its rotation is inconvenient, by throw|ing men, of whatever ability, by intervals, out of public employments. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Its <HI>Agrarian</HI> is im|practicable. Men will &s;oon learn the art, which was practis'd in antient <HI>Rome,</HI> of concealing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions under other peoples names; till at la&s;t, the abu&s;e will become &s;o common, that they will throw off, even the appearance of re&s;traint. <HI>Third|ly,</HI> The <HI>Oceana</HI> provides not a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for liberty or the redre&s;s of grievances. The &s;enate mu&s;t propo&s;e, and the people con&s;ent; by which
<PB N="284" REF="285">
means, the &s;enate have not only a negative upon the people, but what is of infinitely greater con&s;e|quence, their negative goes before the votes of the people. Were the king's negative of the &s;ame na|ture in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, and cou'd he pre|vent any bill from coming into parliament, he wou'd be an ab&s;olute monarch. As his negative follows the votes of the hou&s;es, it is of little con|&s;equence: Such a difference is there in the man|ner of placing the &s;ame thing. When a popular bill has been debated in the two hou&s;es, is brought to maturity, all its conveniencies and inconvenien|cies weigh'd and balanc'd; if afterwards it be pre|&s;ented for the royal a&s;&s;ent, few princes will ven|ture to reject the unanimous de&s;ire of the people. But cou'd the king cru&s;h a di&s;agreeable bill in em|bryo (as was the ca&s;e, for &s;ome time in the <HI>Scotch</HI> parliament, by means of the lords of the articles) the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government wou'd have no balance, nor wou'd grievances ever be redre&s;t: And 'tis certain, that exorbitant power proceeds not, in any govern|ment, from new laws, &s;o much as from neglecting to remedy the abu&s;es, which frequently ri&s;e upon the old ones. A government, &s;ays <HI>Machiavel,</HI> mu&s;t often be brought back to its original prin|ciples. It appears, then, that in the <HI>Oceana</HI> the whole legi&s;lature may be &s;aid to re&s;t in the &s;enate; which <HI>Harrington</HI> wou'd own to be an inconve|nient form of government; e&s;pecially after the <HI>Agrarian</HI> is aboli&s;h'd.</P>

All the&s;e mu&s;t be &s;enators. The &s;enate al&s;o names all the amba&s;&s;adors to fo|reign courts, who may either be &s;enators or not.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate may continue any or all of the&s;e, but mu&s;t re-elect them every year.</P>
<P>THE protector and two &s;ecretaries have &s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;uffrage in the council of &s;tate. The bu&s;ine&s;s of that council is all foreign politics. The coun|cil of &s;tate has &s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;uffrage in all the other councils.</P>
<P>THE council of religion and learning in&s;pects the univer&s;ities and clergy. That of trade in&s;pects e|very thing that may affect commerce. That of laws in&s;pects all the abu&s;es of laws by the inferior magi&s;trates, and examines what improvements may be made of the municipal law. That of war in|&s;pects the militia and its di&s;cipline, magazines, &s;tores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when the republic is in war, ex|amines into the proper orders for generals. The council of admiralty has the &s;ame power with re|gard
<PB N="289" REF="290">
to the navy, along with the nomination of the captains and all inferior officers.</P>
<P>NONE of the&s;e councils can give orders them|&s;elves, except where they receive &s;uch powers from the &s;enate. In other ca&s;es, they mu&s;t communicate every thing to the &s;enate.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;enate is under adjournment, any of the councils may a&s;&s;emble it before the day ap|pointed for its meeting.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e councils or courts, there is ano|ther call'd the court of <HI>competitors,</HI> which is thus con&s;tituted. If any candidates for the office of &s;e|nator have more votes than a third of the repre&s;en|tatives, that candidate, which has mo&s;t votes, next to the &s;enator elected, becomes incapable for one year of all public offices, even of being a magi&s;trate or repre&s;entative: But he takes his &s;eat in the court of competitors. Here then is a court, which may &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t of a hundred members; &s;ometimes have no members at all; and by that means, be for a year aboli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>THE court of competitors has no power in the commonwealth. It has only the in&s;pection of public accounts, and the accu&s;ing any man before the &s;enate. If the &s;enate acquit him, the court of competitors may, if they plea&s;e, appeal to the people, either magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives. Up|on that appeal, the magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives meet on the day appointed by the court of compe|titors,
<PB N="290" REF="291">
and chu&s;e in each county three per&s;ons; from which number every &s;enator is excluded. The&s;e to the number of 300 meet in the capital, and bring the per&s;on accus'd to a new trial.</P>
<P>The court of competitors may propo&s;e any law to the &s;enate; and if refus'd may appeal to the people, that is to the magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives, who examine it in their counties. Every &s;enator, who is thrown out of the &s;enate by a vote of the court, takes his &s;eat in the court of competitors.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the judicative authority of the hou&s;e of lords, that is, all the appeals from the inferior courts. It likewi&s;e nominates the lord chancellor, and all the officers of the law.</P>
<P>EVERY county is a kind of republic within it&s;elf, and the repre&s;entatives may make county laws; which have no authority 'till three months after they are voted. A copy of the law is &s;ent to the &s;enate, and to every other county. The &s;enate or any &s;ingle county may, at any time, annul any law of another county.</P>
<P>THE repre&s;entatives have all the authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> ju&s;tices of the peace in trials, commit|ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates have the nomination of all the officers of the revenue in each county. All cau&s;es with regard to the revenue are appeal'd ultimately
<PB N="291" REF="292">
to the magi&s;trates. They pa&s;s the accompts of all the officers; but mu&s;t have all their own accompts examin'd and pa&s;t at the end of the year by the repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates name rectors or mini&s;ters to all the pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>THE presbyterian government is e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical court is an a&s;&s;embly or &s;ynod of all the presbyters of the county. The magi&s;trates may take any cau&s;e from this court, and determine it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates may try, and depo&s;e or &s;u&s;|pend any presbyter.</P>
<P>THE militia is e&s;tabli&s;h'd in imitation of that in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> which being well known, we &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon it. 'Twill only be proper to make this addition, that an army of 20,000 be annually drawn out by rotation, paid and encamp'd during &s;ix weeks in &s;ummer; that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates nominate all the colonels and downwards. The &s;enate all upwards. During war, the general nominates the colonel and down|wards, and his commi&s;&s;ion is good for a twelve|month. But after that it mu&s;t be confirm'd by the magi&s;trates of the county, to which the regiment belongs. The magi&s;trates may break any officer in the county regiment. And the &s;enate may do the &s;ame to any officer in the &s;ervice. If the ma|gi&s;trates
<PB N="292" REF="293">
do not think proper to confirm the gene|ral's choice, they may nominate another officer in the place of him they reject.</P>
<P>ALL crimes are try'd within the county by the magi&s;trates and a jury. But the &s;enate can &s;top a|ny trial, and bring it before them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ANY county may indict any man before the &s;e|nate, for any crime.</P>
<P>THE protector, the two &s;ecretaries, the coun|cil of &s;tate, with any five more that the &s;enate ap|points, on extraordinary emergencies, are po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>dictatorial</HI> power for &s;ix months.</P>
<P>THE protector may pardon any per&s;on con|demn'd by the inferior courts.</P>
<P>IN time of war, no officer of the army, that is in the field, can have any civil office in the com|monwealth.</P>
<P>THE capital, which we &s;hall call <HI>London,</HI> may be allow'd four members in the &s;enate. It may therefore be divided into four counties. The re|pre&s;entatives of each of the&s;e chu&s;e one &s;enator, and ten magi&s;trates. There are therefore in the city four &s;enators, forty four magi&s;trates, and four hun|dred repre&s;entatives. The magi&s;trates have the &s;ame authority as in the counties. The repre&s;en|tatives al&s;o have the &s;ame authority; but they ne|ver meet in one general court: They give their
<PB N="293" REF="294">
votes in their particular county or divi&s;ion of hun|dreds.</P>
<P>WHEN they enact any city law, the greate&s;t number of counties or divi&s;ions determines the mat|ter. And where the&s;e are equal, the magi&s;trates have the ca&s;ting vote.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates chu&s;e the mayor, &s;heriff, re|corder and other officers of the city.</P>
<P>IN the commonwealth, no repre&s;entative, ma|gi&s;trate, or &s;enator, as &s;uch, has any &s;alary. The protector, &s;ecretaries, councils, and amba&s;&s;adors have &s;alaries.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t year in every century is &s;et apart to correct all inequalities, which time may have pro|duc'd in the repre&s;entation. This mu&s;t be done by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>THE following political aphori&s;ms may explain the rea&s;on of the&s;e orders.</P>
<P>THE lower &s;ort of people and &s;mall proprietors are good enough judges of one not very di&s;tant from them in rank or habitation; and therefore, in their parochial meetings, will probably chu&s;e the be&s;t or nearly the be&s;t repre&s;entative: But they are wholly unfit for county meetings, and for electing into the higher offices of the republic. Their ignorance gives the grandees an opportuni|ty of deceiving them.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="295">
TEN thou&s;and, even tho' they were not annu|ally elected, are a large enough ba&s;is for any free government. 'Tis true, the nobles in <HI>Poland</HI> are more than 10,000, and yet the&s;e oppre&s;s the people. But as power continues there always in the &s;ame per&s;ons and families, this makes them, in a man|ner, a different nation from the people. Be&s;ides, the nobles are there united under a few heads of families.</P>
<P>ALL free governments mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of two coun|cils, a le&s;s and a greater, or in other words, of a &s;enate and people. The people, as <HI>Harrington</HI> ob|&s;erves, wou'd want wi&s;dom, without the &s;enate: The &s;enate, without the people, wou'd want ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>A LARGE a&s;&s;embly of 1000, for in&s;tance, to re|pre&s;ent the people, if allow'd to debate, wou'd fall into di&s;order. If not allow'd to debate, the &s;enate has a negative upon them, and the wor&s;t kind of negative, that before re&s;olution.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is an inconvenience which no government has yet fully remedy'd, but which is the ea&s;ie&s;t to be remedy'd in the world. If the people debate, all is confu&s;ion: If they do not de|bate, they can only re&s;olve; and then the &s;enate carves for them. Divide the people into many &s;e|parate bodies; and then they may debate with
<PB N="295" REF="296">
&s;afety, and every inconvenience &s;eems to be pre|vented.</P>
<P>CARDINAL <HI>de Retz</HI> &s;ays, that all numerous a&s;|&s;emblies, however compos'd, are mere mob, and &s;way'd in their debates by the lea&s;t motive. This we find confirm'd by daily experience. When an ab&s;urdity &s;trikes a member, he conveys it to his neighbour, and &s;o on, till the whole be infected. Separate this great body; and tho every member be only of middling &s;en&s;e, 'tis not probable, that a|ny thing but rea&s;on can prevail over the whole. Influence and example being remov'd, good &s;en&s;e will always get the better of bad among a num|ber of people, Good &s;en&s;e is one thing: But fol|lies are numberle&s;s; and every man has a diffe|rent one. The only way of making a people wi&s;e is to keep them from uniting into large a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>THERE are two things to be guarded again&s;t in every <HI>&s;enate:</HI> Its combination and its divi&s;ion. Its combination is mo&s;t dangerous; and again&s;t this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies. 1, The great dependence of the &s;ena|tors on the people by annual elections; and that not by an undi&s;tingui&s;hing rabble, like the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> electors, but by men of fortune and education. 2, The &s;mall power they are allow'd. They have few offices to di&s;po&s;e of. Almo&s;t all are given by the magi&s;trates in the counties. 3, The court of
<PB N="296" REF="297">
competitors, which being compos'd of men that are their rivals, next to them in intere&s;t, and un|ea&s;y in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, will be &s;ure to take all advantages again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion of the &s;enate is prevented, 1, By the &s;mallne&s;s of their number. 2, As faction &s;up|po&s;es a combination to a &s;eparate intere&s;t, it is pre|vented by their dependence on the people. 3, They have a power of expelling any factious member. 'Tis true, when another member of the &s;ame &s;pirit comes from the county, they have no power of expelling him: Nor is it fit they &s;hou'd; for that &s;hows the humour to be in the people, and probably ari&s;es from &s;ome ill conduct in public affairs. 4, Almo&s;t any man, in a &s;enate &s;o regularly cho&s;en by the people, may be &s;uppos'd fit for any civil office. 'Twou'd be proper, there|fore, for the &s;enate to form &s;ome <HI>general</HI> re&s;oluti|ons with regard to the di&s;po&s;ing of offices among the members: Which re&s;olutions wou'd not con|fine them in critical times, when extraordinary parts on the one hand, or extraordinary &s;tupidity on the other, appears in any &s;enator; but yet they wou'd be &s;ufficient to prevent brigue and faction, by making the di&s;po&s;al of the offices a thing of cour&s;e. For in&s;tance; let it be a re&s;olution, that no man &s;hall enjoy any office, till he has &s;at four years in the &s;enate: That, except amba&s;&s;adors, no man &s;hall be in office two years following: That
<PB N="297" REF="298">
no man &s;hall attain the higher offices but thro' the lower; That no man &s;hall be protector twice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;enate of <HI>Venice</HI> govern them&s;elves by &s;uch re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>IN foreign politics the intere&s;t of the &s;enate can &s;carc eever be divided from that of the people; and therefore 'tis fit to make the &s;enate ab&s;olute with regard to them; otherwi&s;e there cou'd be no &s;e crecy nor refin'd policy. Be&s;ides, without mo|ney, no alliance can be executed; and the &s;enate is &s;till &s;ufficiently dependent. Not to mention, that the legi&s;lative power being always &s;uperior to the executive, the magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives may interpo&s;e, whenever they think proper.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;upport of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government is the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts; but that, tho' in the main &s;erviceable, breeds endle&s;s factions. In the foregoing plan, it does all the good without any of the harm. The <HI>competitors</HI> have no power of controlling the &s;enate: They have only the power of accu&s;ing, and appealing to the people.</P>
<P>'TIS nece&s;&s;ary, likewi&s;e, to prevent both com|bination and divi&s;ion in the thou&s;and magi&s;trates. This is done &s;ufficiently by the &s;eparation of places and intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT le&s;t that &s;hou'd not be enough, their de|pendence on the 10,000 for their elections, &s;erves to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
NOR is that all: For the 10,000 may re&s;ume the power, whenever they plea&s;e; and not only when they all plea&s;e, but when any five of a hun|dred plea&s;e, which will happen upon the very fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a &s;eparate intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE 10,000 are too large a body either to u|nite or divide, except when they meet in one place, and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders. Not to mention their annual election, by almo&s;t the whole body of the people.</P>
<P>A SMALL commonwealth is the happie&s;t go|vernment in the world, within it&s;elf; becau&s;e eve|ry thing lyes under the eye of the rulers: But it may be &s;ubdu'd by great force from without. This &s;cheme &s;eems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth.</P>
<P>EVERY county law may be anull'd either by the &s;enate or another county; becau&s;e that &s;hows an oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts: In which ca&s;e, no part ought to decide for it&s;elf. The matter mu&s;t be referr'd to the whole, which will be&s;t determine what agrees with general intere&s;t.</P>
<P>AS to the clergy and militia, the rea&s;ons of the&s;e orders are obvious. Without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magi&s;trate, and without a militia, 'tis folly to think any free government will ever have &s;ecurity or &s;tability.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="300">
IN many governments, the inferior magi&s;trates have no rewards but what ari&s;e from their ambiti|on, vanity, or public &s;pirit. The &s;alaries of the <HI>French</HI> judges amount not to the intere&s;t of the &s;ums they pay for their offices. The <HI>Dutch</HI> bur|go-ma&s;ters have little more immediate profit than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ju&s;tices of peace, or the members of the hou&s;e of commons formerly. But le&s;t any &s;hou'd &s;u&s;pect that this wou'd beget negligence in the admini&s;tration, (which is little to be fear'd con|&s;idering the natural ambition of mankind) let the magi&s;trates have competent &s;alaries. The &s;ena|tors have acce&s;s to &s;o many honourable and lucra|tive offices, that their attendance needs not be bought. There is little attendance requir'd of the repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THAT the foregoing plan of government is practicable, no one can doubt, who con&s;iders the re&s;emblance it bears to the commonwealth of the United provinces, formerly one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t renown'd governments, that ever was in the world. The alterations in the pre&s;ent &s;cheme are all evidently to the better. 1, The repre&s;en|tation is more equal. 2, The unlimited power of the burgo-ma&s;ters in the towns, which forms a perfect ari&s;tocracy in the <HI>Dutch</HI> commonwealth, is corrected by a well temper'd democracy, in giv|ing to the people the annual election of the coun|ty
<PB N="300" REF="301">
repre&s;entatives. 3, The negative, which eve|ry province and town has upon the whole body of the <HI>Dutch</HI> republic, with regard to alliances, peace and war, and the impo&s;ition of taxes, is here re|mov'd. 4, The counties, in the pre&s;ent plan, are not &s;o independent of each other, nor do they form &s;eparate bodies &s;o much as the &s;even provinces; where the jealou&s;y and envy of the &s;maller pro|vinces and towns again&s;t the greater, particular|ly <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> have frequently di&s;|turb'd the government. 5, Larger powers, tho' of the &s;afe&s;t kind, are entru&s;ted to the &s;enate than the States General po&s;&s;e&s;s; by which means, the former may become more expeditious, and &s;ecret in their re&s;olutions, than 'tis po&s;&s;ible for the latter.</P>
<P>THE chief alterations, that cou'd be made on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government, in order to bring it to the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t perfect model of limited monarchy, &s;eem to be the following. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The plan of the republican par|liament ought to be re&s;tor'd, by making the repre|&s;entation equal, and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who po&s;&s;e&s;s not a hundred a year. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As &s;uch a hou&s;e of commons wou'd be too weighty for a frail hou&s;e of lords, like the pre&s;ent, the bi&s;hops and <HI>Scotch</HI> peers ought to be remov'd, who&s;e behaviour, <HI>in former parli|aments,</HI> de&s;troy'd entirely the authority of that hou&s;e: The number of the upper hou&s;e ought to be rais'd to three or four hundred: Their &s;eats not
<PB N="301" REF="302">
hereditary, but during life: They ought to have the election of their own members; and no com|moner &s;hou'd be allow'd to refu&s;e a &s;eat, that was offer'd him. By this means, the hou&s;e of lords wou'd con&s;i&s;t entirely of the men of chief credit, ability, and intere&s;t of the nation; and every tur|bulent leader in the hou&s;e of commons might be taken off, and connected in intere&s;t with the hou&s;e of peers. Such an ari&s;tocracy wou'd be an excel|lent barrier both to the monarchy and again&s;t it. At pre&s;ent, the balance of our government de|pends, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the ability and behavi|our of the &s;overeign; which are variable and un|certain circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I ALLOW, that this plan of limited monarchy, however corrected, is &s;till liable to three great in|conveniencies. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It removes not entirely, tho it may &s;often, the parties of <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country. Se|condly,</HI> The king's per&s;onal character mu&s;t &s;till have a great influence on the government. <HI>Third|ly,</HI> The &s;word is in the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on, who will always neglect to di&s;cipline the militia, in order to have a pretext for keeping up a &s;tand|ing army. 'Tis evident, that this is a mortal di&s;|temper in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government, of which it mu&s;t at la&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. I mu&s;t, however, con|fe&s;s, that <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eems, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to have remedy'd this inconvenience, and to have a mili|tia, along with its limited monarchy, as well as a

&s;tanding army, which is le&s;s dangerous than the <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving the fal&s;hood of the common opinion, that no large &s;tate, &s;uch as <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Britain,</HI> cou'd ever be mo|dell'd into a commonwealth, but that &s;uch a form of government can only take place in a city or &s;mall territory. The contrary &s;eems evident. Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a republican government in an exten&s;ive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is form'd, of pre&s;erving it &s;teady and uniform, without tumult and faction, in the former than in the latter. 'Tis not ea&s;y, for the di&s;tant parts of a large &s;tate to combine in any plan of free government; but they ea&s;ily con|&s;pire in the e&s;teem and reverence for a &s;ingle per|&s;on, who, by means of this popular favour, may &s;eize the power, and forcing the more ob&s;tinate to &s;ubmit, may e&s;tabli&s;h a monarchical government. On the other hand, a city readily concurs in the &s;ame notions of government, the natural equality of property favours liberty, and the nearne&s;s of ha|bitation enables the citizens mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. Even under ab&s;olute princes, the &s;ubordi|nate government of cities is commonly republican; while that of counties and provinces is monarchical. But the&s;e &s;ame circum&s;tances, which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities, render their con&s;titution more frail and uncertain. Democra|cies
<PB N="303" REF="304">
are turbulent. For however the people may be &s;eparated or divided into &s;mall parties, either in their votes or elections; their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very &s;en&s;ible. Ari&s;tocracies are bet|ter adapted for peace and order, and accordingly were mo&s;t admired by antient writers; but they are jealous and oppre&s;&s;ive. In a large government, which is modell'd with ma&s;terly &s;kill, there is com|pa&s;s and room enough to refine the democracy, from the lower people, who may be admitted into the fir&s;t elections or fir&s;t concoction of the com|monwealth, to the higher magi&s;trates, who direct all the motions. At the &s;ame time, the parts are &s;o di&s;tant and remote, that 'tis very difficult, either by intrigue, prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, to hurry them into any mea&s;ures again&s;t the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>'TIS needle&s;s to enquire whether &s;uch a govern|ment wou'd be immortal. I allow the ju&s;tne&s;s of the poet's exclamation on the endle&s;s projects of human race, <HI>Man and for ever!</HI> The world it&s;elf probably is not immortal. Such con&s;uming plagues may ari&s;e as wou'd leave even a perfect govern|ment a weak prey to its neighbours. We know not, how far enthu&s;ia&s;m, or other extraordinary motions of the human mind, may tran&s;port men, to the neglect of all order and public good. Where difference of intere&s;t is remov'd, whim&s;ical and unaccountable factions often ari&s;e, from per&s;onal
<PB N="304" REF="305">
favour or enmity. Perhaps, ru&s;t may grow to the &s;prings of the mo&s;t accurate political machine, and di&s;order its motions. La&s;tly, exten&s;ive conque&s;ts when pur&s;u'd, mu&s;t be the ruin of every free go|vernment, and of the more perfect governments &s;ooner than of the imperfect; becau&s;e of the very advantages, which the former po&s;&s;e&s;s above the lat|ter. And tho' &s;uch a &s;tate ought to e&s;tabli&s;h a fun|damental law again&s;t conque&s;ts: Yet republics have ambition as well as individuals, and pre&s;ent in|tere&s;t makes men forgetful of their po&s;terity. 'Tis a &s;ufficient incitement to human endeavours, that &s;uch a government wou'd flouri&s;h for many ages; without pretending to be&s;tow on any work of man, that immortality, which the Almighty &s;eems to have refus'd to his own productions.</P>
