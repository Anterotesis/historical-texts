<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT Of the French Editors.</HEAD>
<P>THE name and writings of Mr. Hume
have been long &s;ince well known
throughout Europe. At the &s;ame time, his
per&s;onal acquaintance have remarked, in
the candour and &s;implicity of his manners,
that impartiality and ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition
which di&s;tingui&s;hes his character,
and is &s;ufficiently indicated in his writings.</P>
<P>He hath exerted tho&s;e great talents he re|ceived
from nature, and the acqui&s;itions he
made by &s;tudy, in the &s;earch of truth, and
promoting the good of mankind: never
wa&s;ting his time, or &s;acrificing his repo&s;e,
in literary or per&s;onal di&s;putes. He hath
&s;een his writings frequently cen&s;ured with
bitterne&s;s, by fanatici&s;m, ignorance, and the
&s;pirit of party, without ever giving an an|&s;wer
to his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e who have attacked his works
with the greate&s;t violence, have always re|&s;pected
his per&s;onal character. His love of
peace is &s;o well known, that the critici&s;ms
written again&s;t his pieces, have been often
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
brought him by their re&s;pective authors, for
him to revi&s;e and correct them. At one time,
in particular, a performance of this kind was
&s;hewn to him; in which he had been treat|ed
in a very rude and even injurious manner;
on remarking which to the author, the latter
&s;truck out the exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages; blu&s;h|ing,
and wondering at the force of that <HI>polemic
&s;pirit</HI> which had carried him imperceptibly
away beyond the bounds of truth and decency.</P>
<P>It was with great reluctance that a man,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch pacific di&s;po&s;itions, could
be brought to con&s;ent to the publication of
the following piece. He was very &s;en&s;ible
that the quarrels among men of letters are
a &s;candal to philo&s;ophy; nor was any per&s;on
in the world le&s;s formed for giving occa&s;ion
to a &s;candal, &s;o con&s;olatory to blockheads.
But the circum&s;tances were &s;uch as to draw
him into it, in &s;pite of his inclinations.</P>
<P>All the world knows that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau,
pro&s;cribed in almo&s;t every country where he
re&s;ided, determined at length to take re|fuge
in England; and that Mr. Hume, af|fected
by his &s;ituation, and his misfortunes,
undertook to bring him over, and to pro|vide
for him a peaceful, &s;afe, and conve|nient
alylum. But very few per&s;ons are
privy to the zeal, activity, and even deli|cacy,
with which Mr. Hume conferred this
act of benevolence; what an affectionate
<PB N="v" REF="4">
attachment he had contracted for this new
friend, which humanity had given him;
with what addre&s;s he endeavoured to anti|cipate
his de&s;ires, without offending his
pride; in &s;hort, with what addre&s;s he &s;trove
to ju&s;tify, in the eyes of others, the &s;ingu|larities
of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, and to defend his
character again&s;t tho&s;e who were not di&s;|po&s;ed
to think &s;o favourably of him as he
did him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Even at the time when Mr. Hume was
employed in doing Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, he received from him the
mo&s;t in&s;olent and abu&s;ive letter. The more
&s;uch a &s;troke was unexpected, the more
it was cruel and affecting. Mr. Hume wrote
an account of this extraordinary adventure
to his friends at Paris; and expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
in his letters with all that indignation
which &s;o &s;trange a proceeding mu&s;t excite.
He thought him&s;elf under no obligation to
keep terms with a man, who, after having
received from him the mo&s;t certain and con|&s;tant
marks of friend&s;hip, could reproach
him, without any rea&s;on, as fal&s;e, treache|rous,
and as the mo&s;t wicked of mankind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the di&s;pute between
the&s;e two celebrated per&s;onages did not fail
to make a noi&s;e. The complaints of Mr.
Hume &s;oon came to the knowlege of the
public; which at fir&s;t hardly believed it po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau could be guilty of
that exce&s;&s;ive ingratitude laid to his charge.
Even Mr. Hume's friends were fearful, le&s;t,
in the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of &s;en&s;ibility, he was
not carried too far, and had not mi&s;taken
for wilful crimes of the heart, the vagaries
of the imagination, or the deceptions of the
under&s;tanding. He judged it nece&s;&s;ary,
therefore, to explain the affair, by writing
a preci&s;e narrative of all that pa&s;&s;ed between
him and Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, from their fir&s;t
connection to their rupture. This narrative
he &s;ent to his friends; &s;ome of whom ad|vi&s;ed
him to print it; alledging, that as Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau's accu&s;ations were become public,
the proofs of his ju&s;tification ought to be &s;o
too. Mr. Hume did not give into the&s;e ar|guments,
choo&s;ing rather to run the ri&s;k of
being unju&s;tly cen&s;ured, than to re&s;olve on
making him&s;elf a public party in an affair,
&s;o contrary to his di&s;po&s;ition and character.
A new incident, however, at length over|came
his reluctance. Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau had ad|dre&s;&s;ed
a letter to a book&s;eller at Paris; in
which he directly accu&s;es Mr. Hume of
having entered into a league with his ene|mies,
to betray and defame him; and in
which he boldly defies Mr. Hume to print
the papers he had in his hands. This letter
was communicated to &s;everal per&s;ons in Pa|ris,
was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and the
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
tran&s;lation printed in the public papers in
London. An accu&s;ation and defiance &s;o
very public could not be &s;uffered to pa&s;s
without reply; while any long &s;ilence on
the part of Mr. Hume might have been in|terpreted
little in his favour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the news of this di&s;pute had
&s;pread it&s;elf over Europe, and the opinions
entertained of it were various. It had
doubtle&s;s been much happier, if the whole
affair had been buried in oblivion, and re|mained
a profound &s;ecret: but as it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to prevent the public intere&s;ting it|&s;elf
in the controver&s;y, it became nece&s;&s;ary
at lea&s;t that the truth of the matter &s;hould
be known. Mr. Hume's friends unitedly
repre&s;ented to him all the&s;e rea&s;ons; the
force of which he was at length convinced
of; and &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity, con&s;ented,
though with reluctance, to the printing of
his memorial.</P>
<P>The narrative, and notes, are tran&s;lated
from the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And are now re-tran&s;lated, for the mo&s;t part, from the French; the French editors having taken &s;ome li|berties, not without Mr. Hume's con&s;ent, with the Engli&s;h original. <BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The letters of Mr.

Not that he can flatter him&s;elf with having always &s;ucceeded in the latter. He has taken the liberty al&s;o to add a note or two, regard|ing &s;ome particular circum&s;tances which had come to his knowlege.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">
This pamphlet contains many &s;trange in|&s;tances

who do not chu&s;e to take that trouble, how|ever,
may po&s;&s;ibly do better; as its contents
are of little importance, except to tho&s;e who
are immediately intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the whole, Mr. Hume, in offering to
the public the genuine pieces of his trial,
has authori&s;ed us to declare, that he will ne|ver
take up the pen again on the &s;ubject.
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau indeed may return to the

CONTROVERSY
BETWEEN
Mr. HUME and Mr. ROUSSEAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Augu&s;t 1, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY connection with Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau be|gan
in 1762, when the Parliament
of Paris had i&s;&s;ued an arret for apprehending
him, on account of his <HI>Emilius.</HI> I was at
that time at Edinburgh. A per&s;on of great
worth wrote to me from Paris, that Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau intended to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in
England, and de&s;ired I would do him all the
good offices in my power. As I conceived
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau had actually put his de&s;ign in
execution, I wrote to &s;everal of my friends
in London, recommending this celebrated
exile to their favour. I wrote al&s;o imme|diately
to Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau him&s;elf; a&s;&s;uring
<PB N="2" REF="9">
him of my de&s;ire to oblige, and readine&s;s to
&s;erve him. At the &s;ame time, I invited him
to come to Edinburgh, if the &s;ituation would
be agreeable, and offered him a retreat in
my own hou&s;e, &s;o long as he &s;hould plea&s;e
to partake of it. There needed no other
motive to excite me to this act of humanity,
than the idea given me of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's
per&s;onal character, by the friend who had
recommended him, his well-known genius
and abilities, and above all, his misfortunes;
the very cau&s;e of which was an additional
rea&s;on to intere&s;t me in his favour. The
following is the an&s;wer I received.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Motiers-Travers, <DATE>Feb. 19, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not receive till lately, and at this
place, the letter you did me the ho|nour
to direct to me at London, the 2d of
July la&s;t, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that I was then
arrived at that capital. I &s;hould doubtle&s;s
have made choice of a retreat in your coun|try,
and as near as po&s;&s;ible to your&s;elf, if I
had fore&s;een what a reception I was to meet
with in my own. No other nation could
claim a preference to England. And this
<PB N="3" REF="10">
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for which I have dearly &s;uf|fered,
was at that time too natural not to
be very excu&s;able; but to my great a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
as well as that of the public, I have met
with nothing but affronts and in&s;ults, where
I hoped to have found con&s;olation at lea&s;t, if
not gratitude. How many rea&s;ons have I not
to regret the want of that a&s;ylum and philo|&s;ophical
ho&s;pitality I &s;hould have found with
you! My misfortunes indeed have con|&s;tantly
&s;eemed to lead me in a manner that
way. The protection and kindne&s;s of my
Lord Mar&s;hal, your worthy and illu&s;trious
countryman, hath brought Scotland home
to me, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, in the
mid&s;t of Switzerland; he hath made you
&s;o often bear a part in our conver&s;ation,
hath brought me &s;o well acquainted with
your virtues, which I before was only with
your talents, that he in&s;pired me with the
mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip for you, and the mo&s;t
ardent de&s;ire of obtaining yours, before I
even knew you were di&s;po&s;ed to grant it.
Judge then of the plea&s;ure I &s;eel, at finding
this inclination reciprocal. No, Sir, I
&s;hould pay your merit but half its due, if
it were the &s;ubject only of my admiration.
Your great impartiallty, together with your
amazing penetration and genius, would lift
you far above the re&s;t of mankind, if you
were le&s;s attached to them by the goodne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="11">
of your heart. My Lord Mar&s;hal, in ac|quainting
me that the amiablene&s;s of your
di&s;po&s;ition was &s;till greater than the &s;ubli|mity
of your genius, rendered a corre&s;pond|ence
with you every day more de&s;irable,
and cheri&s;hed in me tho&s;e wi&s;hes which
he in&s;pired, of ending my days near you.
Oh, Sir, that a better &s;tate of health, and
more convenient circum&s;tances, would but
enable me to take &s;uch a journey in the
manner I could like! Could I but hope to
&s;ee you and my Lord Mar&s;hal one day &s;ettled
in your own country; which &s;hould for ever
after be mine; I &s;hould be thankful, in &s;uch
a &s;ociety, for the very misfortunes that led
me into it, and &s;hould account the day of
its commencement as the fir&s;t of my life.
Would to Heaven I might live to &s;ee that
happy day, though now more to be de&s;ired
than expected! With what tran&s;ports &s;hould
I not exclaim, on &s;etting foot in that happy
country which gave birth to David Hume
and the Lord Mar&s;hal of Scotland!</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter is not publi&s;hed from a motive
of vanity; as will be &s;een pre&s;ently, when
I give the reader a recantation of all the eu|logies
it contains; but only to compleat the
<PB N="5" REF="12">
cour&s;e of our corre&s;pondence, and to &s;hew
that I have been long &s;ince di&s;po&s;ed to Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>From this time our corre&s;pondence en|tirely
cea&s;ed, till about the middle of la&s;t
autumn (1765;) when it was renewed by
the following accident. A certain lady of
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's acquaintance, being on a
journey to one of the French provinces,
bordering on Switzerland, had taken that
opportunity of paying a vi&s;it to our &s;olitary
philo&s;opher, in his retreat at Motiers-Tra|vers.
To this lady he complained, that his
&s;ituation in New&s;chatel was become ex|tremely
di&s;agreeable, as well on account of
the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, as the re&s;ent|ment
of the clergy; and that he was afraid
he &s;hould &s;hortly be under the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;eeking an a&s;ylum el&s;ewhere; in which ca&s;e,
England appeared to him, from the nature
of its laws and government, to be the only
place to which he could retire with perfect
&s;ecurity; adding, that my Lord Mar&s;hal,
his former protector, had advi&s;ed him to
put him&s;elf under my protection (that was
the term he was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of)
and that he would accordingly addre&s;s him|&s;elf
to me, if he thought it would not be
giving me too much trouble.</P>
<P>I was at that time charged with the af|fairs
of England at the court of France;
<PB N="6" REF="13">
but as I had the pro&s;pect of &s;oon returning
to London, I could not reject a propo&s;al
made to me under &s;uch circum&s;tances, by a
man &s;o celebrated for his genius and misfor|tunes.
As &s;oon as I was thus informed,
therefore, of the &s;ituation and intentions of
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, I wrote to him, making him
an offer of my &s;ervices; to which he re|turned
the following an&s;wer.</P>

<P>THE remembrance of your former
kindne&s;s, induces me to be again im|portunate.
It is to de&s;ire you will be &s;o good,

</LETTER>
<P>It is with reluctance I &s;ay it, but I am
compelled to it; I now know of a certainty
that this affectation of extreme poverty and
di&s;tre&s;s was a mere pretence, a petty kind of
impo&s;ture which Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau &s;ucce&s;sfully
employed to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="9" REF="16">
public; but I was then very far from &s;u&s;|pecting
any &s;uch artifice. I mu&s;t own, I
felt on this occa&s;ion an emotion of pity,
mixed with indignation, to think a man of
letters of &s;uch eminent merit, &s;hould be re|duced,
in &s;pite of the &s;implicity of his man|ner
of living, to &s;uch extreme indigence;
and that this unhappy &s;tate &s;hould be rendered
more intolerable by &s;ickne&s;s, by the approach
of old age, and the implacable rage of per|&s;ecution.
I knew that many per&s;ons impu|ted
the wretchedne&s;s of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau to
his exce&s;&s;ive pride, which induced him to
refu&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend; but I
thought this fault, if it were a fault, was a
very re&s;pectable one. Too many men of
letters have debated their character in &s;toop|ing
&s;o low as to &s;olicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of per|&s;ons
of wealth or power, unworthy of af|fording
them protection; and I conceived
that a noble pride, even though carried to
exce&s;s, merited &s;ome indulgence in a man of
genius, who, borne up by a &s;en&s;e of his own
&s;uperiority and a love of independence, &s;hould
have braved the &s;torms of fortune and the in|&s;ults
of mankind. I propo&s;ed, therefore,
to &s;erve Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau in his own way. I
de&s;ired Mr. Clairaut, accordingly, to give
me his letter; which I &s;hewed to &s;everal of
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's friends and patrons in Paris.
At the &s;ame time, I propo&s;ed to them a
<PB N="10" REF="17">
&s;cheme, by which he might be relieved,
without &s;u&s;pecting any thing of the matter.
This was to engage the book&s;eller, who was
to publi&s;h his <HI>dictionary,</HI> to give Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau
a greater &s;um for the copy than he had
offered, and to indemnify him by paying him
the difference. But this project, which
could not be executed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Mr. Clairaut, fell to the ground, at the
unexpected decea&s;e of that learned and re|&s;pectable
academician.</P>
<P>Retaining, however, &s;till the &s;ame idea
of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's exce&s;&s;ive poverty, I con|&s;tantly
retained the &s;ame inclination to
oblige him; and when I was informed of
his intention to go to England under my
conduct, I formed a &s;cheme much of the
&s;ame kind with that I could not execute at
Paris. I wrote immediately to my friend,
Mr. John Stewart, of Buckingham &s;treet,
that I had an affair to communicate to him
of &s;o &s;ecret and delicate a nature, that I
&s;hould not venture even to commit it to pa|per,
but that he might learn the particulars
of Mr. Elliot (now Sir Gilbert Elliot) who
would &s;oon return from Paris to London.
The plan was this, and was really communi|cated
by Mr. Elliot &s;ome time after to Mr.
Stewart; who was at the &s;ame time en|joined
to the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">
Mr. Stewart was to look out for &s;ome ho|ne&s;t
di&s;creet farmer in his neighbourhood in
the country, who might be willing to lodge
and board Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau and his Gouvern|ante,
in a very decent and plentiful manner,
at a pen&s;ion which Mr. Stewart might &s;ettle
at fifty or &s;ixty pounds a year; the farmer
engaging to keep &s;uch agreement a profound
&s;ecret, and to receive from Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau
only twenty or twenty-five pounds a year; I
engaging to &s;upply the difference.</P>
<P>It was not long be&s;ore Mr. Stewart wrote
me word he had found a &s;ituation which he
conceived might be agreeable; on which I
de&s;ired he would get the apartment furni&s;hed
in a proper and convenient manner at my
expence. But this &s;cheme, in which there
could not po&s;&s;ibly enter any motive of vanity
on my part, &s;ecrecy being a nece&s;&s;ary con|dition
of its execution, did not take place;
other de&s;igns pre&s;enting them&s;elves more con|venient
and agreeable. The &s;act, however,
is well known both to Mr. Stewart and Sir
Gilbert Elliot.</P>
<P>It will not be improper here to mention
another plan concerted with the &s;ame inten|tions.
I had accompanied Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau
into a very plea&s;ant part of the county of
Surry, where he &s;pent two days at Colonel
Webb's; Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau &s;eeming to me highly
delighted with the natural and &s;olitary beau|ties
<PB N="12" REF="19">
of the place. Through the means of
Mr. Stewart, therefore, I entered into treaty
with Colonel Webb for the purcha&s;ing the
hou&s;e, with a little e&s;tate adjoining, in
order to make a &s;ettlement for Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau.
If after what has pa&s;&s;ed, Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau's
te&s;timony be of any validity, I may
appeal to him&s;elf for the truth of what
I advance. But be this as it will, the&s;e facts
are well known to Mr. Stewart, to General
Clarke, and in part to Colonel Webb.</P>
<P>But to proceed in my narrative. Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau came to Paris, provided with a
pa&s;&s;port, which his friends had obtained for
him. I conducted him to England. For
upwards of two months after our arrival, I
employed my&s;elf, and my friends, in look|ing
out for &s;ome agreeable &s;ituation for him.
We gave way to all his caprices; excu&s;ed
all his &s;ingularities; indulged him in all his
humours; in &s;hort, neither time nor trouble
was &s;pared to procure him what he de&s;ired<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It is probably to this exce&s;&s;ive and ill-judged com|plai&s;ance Mr. H. may in a great degree impute the di&s;|agreeable con&s;equences that have followed. There is no end in indulging caprice, nor any prudence in doing it, when it is known to be &s;uch. It may be thought hu|mane to indulge the weak of body or mind, the decre|pitude of age and imbecility of childhood; but even here it too often proves cruelty to the very parties indulged. How much more inexcu&s;able therefore is it to cheri&s;h the ab&s;urdities of whim and &s;ingularity in men of genius and abilities? How is it po&s;&s;ible to make a man ea&s;y or happy in a world, to who&s;e cu&s;toms and maxims he is determined to run retrograde! No. Capricious men, like froward children, &s;hould be left to kick again&s;t the pricks, and vent their &s;pleen unnoticed. To humour, is only to &s;poil them. <BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>;
<PB N="13" REF="20">
and, notwith&s;tanding he rejected &s;everal of
the projects which I had laid out for him,
yet I thought my&s;elf &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed
for my trouble, by the gratitude and even
affection with which he appeared to repay
my &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>At length his pre&s;ent &s;ettlement was pro|po&s;ed
and approved. Mr. Davenport, a
gentleman of family, fortune, and worth,
offered him his hou&s;e at Wooton, in the
county of Derby, where he him&s;elf &s;eldom
re&s;ides, and at which Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau and his
hou&s;ekeeper are boarded, at a very moderate
expence.</P>
<P>When Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau arrived at Wooton,
he wrote me the following letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<OPENER><DATELINE>Wooton, <DATE>March 22, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee already, my dear patron, by
the date of my letter, that I am ar|rived
at the place of my de&s;tination; but
<PB N="14" REF="21">
you cannot &s;ee all the charms which I find
in it; to do this, you &s;hould be acquainted
with the &s;ituation, and be able to read my
heart. You ought, however, to read at
lea&s;t tho&s;e of my &s;entiments with re&s;pect to
you, and which you have &s;o well de&s;erved.
If I live in this agreeable a&s;ylum as happy as
I hope to do, one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures
of my life will be, to reflect that I owe it
to you. To make another happy, is to de|&s;erve
to be happy one's &s;elf. May you there|fore
find in your&s;elf the reward of all you
have done for me! Had I been alone, I
might perhaps have met with ho&s;pitality,
but I &s;hould have never reli&s;hed it &s;o highly
as I now do, in owing it to your friend&s;hip.
Retain &s;till that friend&s;hip for me, my dear
patron; love me for my &s;ake, who am &s;o
much indebted to you; love me for your
own, for the good you have done me. I am
&s;en&s;ible, of the full value of your &s;incere
friend&s;hip; it is the object of my ardent
wi&s;hes; I am ready to repay it with all
mine, and feel &s;omething in my heart which
may one day convince you that it is not with|out
its value. As, for the rea&s;ons agreed on
between us, I &s;hall receive nothing by the
po&s;t, you will be plea&s;ed, when you have
the goodne&s;s to write to me, to &s;end your
letters to Mr. Davenport. The affair of
the carriage is not yet adju&s;ted, becau&s;e I
<PB N="15" REF="22">
know I was impo&s;ed on: it is a trifling fault,
however, which may be only the effect of
an obliging vanity, unle&s;s it &s;hould happen
to be repeated. If you were concerned in
it, I would advi&s;e you to give up, once for
all, the&s;e little impo&s;itions, which cannot
proceed from any good motive, when con|verted
into &s;nares for &s;implicity. I embrace

<OPENER><DATELINE>Wooton, <DATE>March 29, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will &s;ee, my dear patron, by
the letter Mr. Davenport will have
tran&s;mitted you, how agreeably I find my|&s;elf
&s;ituated in this place. I might, per|haps,
be more at my ea&s;e if I were le&s;s no|ticed;
but the &s;olicitude of &s;o police an ho&s;t
as mine is too obliging to give offence;
and as there is nothing in life without its in|convenience,
that of being too good, is one
of tho&s;e which is the mo&s;t tolerable. I find
a much greater inconvenience in not being
able to make the &s;ervants under&s;tand me,
<PB N="16" REF="23">
and particularly in my not under&s;tanding
them. Luckily Mrs. le Va&s;&s;eur &s;erves me
as interpreter, and her fingers &s;peak better
than my tongue. There is one advantage
however attending my ignorance, which is a
kind of compen&s;ation; it &s;erves to tire
and keep at a di&s;tance impertinent vi&s;itors.
The mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h came to &s;ee me
ye&s;terday, who, finding that I &s;poke to him
only in French, would not &s;peak to me in
Engli&s;h, &s;o that our interview was almo&s;t a
&s;ilent one. I have taken a great fancy to
this expedient, and &s;hall make u&s;e of it with
all my neighbours, if I have any. Nay,
&s;hould I even learn to &s;peak Engli&s;h, I would
conver&s;e with them only in French, e&s;pe|cially
if I were &s;o happy as to find they did
not under&s;tand a word of that language.
An artifice this, much of the &s;ame kind with
that which the Negroes pretend is practi&s;ed by
the monkeys, who, they &s;ay, are capable of
&s;peech, but cannot be prevailed upon to
talk, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;et to work.</P>
<P>It is not true in any &s;en&s;e, that I agreed to
accept of a model from Mr. Go&s;&s;et as a pre|&s;ent.
On the contrary, I a&s;ked him the
price, which he told me was a guinea and
half, adding that he intended to pre&s;ent me
with it; an offer I did not accept. I de&s;ire
you therefore to pay him for it, and Mr.
Davenport will be &s;o good as repay you the
<PB N="17" REF="24">
money. And if Mr. Go&s;&s;et does not con&s;ent
to be paid for it, it mu&s;t be returned to him,
and purcha&s;ed by &s;ome other hand. It is
de&s;igned for Mr. du Peyrou, who de&s;ired
long &s;ince to have my portrait, and cau&s;ed
one to be painted in miniature, which is not
at all like me. You were more fortunate in
this re&s;pect than he, but I am &s;orry that, by
your a&s;&s;iduity to &s;erve me, you deprived me of
the plea&s;ure of di&s;charging the &s;ame friendly
obligation with regard to your&s;elf. Be &s;o good,
my dear patron, as to order the model to be
&s;ent to Me&s;&s;rs. Guinand and Hankey, Little
St. Helen's, Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, in order to
be tran&s;mitted to Mr. du Peyrou by the fir&s;t
&s;afe conveyance. It hath been a fro&s;t ever
&s;ince I have been here: the &s;now falls daily;
and the wind is cutting and &s;evere: notwith|&s;tanding
all which, I had rather lodge in the
hollow trunk of an old tree, in this country,
than in the mo&s;t &s;uperb apartment in London.
Good day, my dear patron. I embrace you
with all my heart.</P>

<P>Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau and I having agreed not to
lay each other under any re&s;traint by a con|tinued
corre&s;pondence, the only &s;ubject of
our future letters was the obtaining a pen&s;ion
for him from the king of England; which
<PB N="18" REF="25">
was then in agitation; and of which affair
the following is a conci&s;e and faithful rela|tion.</P>
<P>As we were conver&s;ing together one eve|ning
at Calais, where we were detained by
contrary winds, I a&s;ked Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau if he
would not accept of a pen&s;ion from the king
of England, in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould be
plea&s;ed to grant him one. To this he re|plied,
it was a matter of &s;ome difficulty to re|&s;olved
on; but that he &s;hould be entirely di|rected
by the advice of my Lord Mar&s;hall.
Encouraged by this an&s;wer, I no &s;ooner ar|rived
in London, than I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to
his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, and particularly to
General Conway, Secretary of State, and
General Graeme, Secretary and Chamberlain
to the queen. Application was accordingly
made to their maje&s;ties, who with their u&s;ual
goodne&s;s con&s;ented, on condition only that
the affair &s;hould not be made publick. Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau and I both wrote to my Lord
Mar&s;hall; and Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau expre&s;sly ob|&s;erved
in his letter, that the circum&s;tance of
the affair's being to be kept &s;ecret, was very
agreeable to him. The con&s;ent of my Lord
Mar&s;hall arrived, as may readily be imagi|ned;
&s;oon after which Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau &s;et out
for Wooton; while the bu&s;ine&s;s remained
<PB N="19" REF="26">
&s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, on account of the in|di&s;po&s;ition
of General Conway.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I began to be afraid,
from what I had ob&s;erved of Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau's
di&s;po&s;ition and character, that his na|tural
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of mind would prevent
his enjoyment of that repo&s;e, to which
the ho&s;pitality and &s;ecurity he found in Eng|land,
invited him. I &s;aw, with infinite re|gret,
that he was born for &s;torms and tu|mults,
and that the di&s;gu&s;t which might
&s;ucceed the peaceful enjoyment of &s;olitude
and tranquillity, would &s;oon render him a
burthen to him&s;elf and every body about
him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In forming the opinion of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's di&s;po|&s;ition, Mr. Hume was by no means &s;ingular: the &s;trik|ing features of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's extraordinary character having been &s;trongly marked in the critici&s;ms on his &s;everal writings, in the Monthly Review, particularly in the account of his Letters from the mountains, in the appendix to the 31&s;t vol. of that work; where this cele|brated genius is de&s;cribed, merely from the general tenour of his writings and the outlines of his publick conduct, to be exactly &s;uch a kind of per&s;on as Mr. Hume hath di&s;covered him from intimate and per&s;onal acquaint|ance. <BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. But, as I lived at the di&s;tance of an
hundred and fifty miles from the place of
his re&s;idence, and was con&s;tantly employed
in doing him good offices, I did not expect
that I my&s;elf &s;hould be the victim of this un|happy
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P>AFFECTED with a mo&s;t lively
&s;en&s;e of the favour his Maje&s;ty hath
honoured me with, and with that of your

tenacious, and which I will never de&s;erve to
lo&s;e. But it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould &s;peak to

the many misfortunes that have befallen me,
I thought my&s;elf armed again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible
events: there have happened to me &s;ome,
however, which I did not fore&s;ee; and which
indeed an ingenuous mind ought not to have
fore&s;een: hence it is that they affect me by
&s;o much the more &s;everely. The trouble in
which they involve me, indeed, deprives me
of the ea&s;e and pre&s;ence of mind nece&s;&s;ary
to direct my conduct: all I can rea&s;onably
do, under &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed a &s;ituation, is to &s;u&s;|pend

importance as is that in agitation. So far
<PB N="26" REF="33">
from refu&s;ing the beneficence of the King
from pride, as is imputed to me, I am proud
of acknowleging it, and am only &s;orry I
cannot do it more publicly. But when I
actually receive it, I would be able to give
up my&s;elf entirely to tho&s;e &s;entiments which
it would naturally in&s;pire, and to have an
heart replete with gratitude for his Maje&s;ty's
goodne&s;s, and yours. I am not at all afraid
this manner of thinking will make any al|teration
in yours towards me. Deign, there|fore,
Sir, to pre&s;erve that goodne&s;s for me,
till a more happy opportunity; when you
will be &s;atisfied that I defer taking the ad|vantage
of it, only to render my&s;elf more

article of &s;ecrecy was in&s;i&s;ted on; but as I
knew that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau had been acquaint|ed
with that condition from the beginning,
I was the le&s;s &s;urprized at his &s;ilence towards
me. I thought, that my friend, con&s;cious
of having treated me ill in this affair, was
a&s;hamed to write to me; and having pre|vailed
on General Conway to keep the mat|ter
&s;till open, I wrote a very friendly letter
<PB N="27" REF="34">
to Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, exhorting him to return
to his former way of thinking, and to ac|cept
of the pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the deep di&s;tre&s;s which he mentions
to General Conway, and which, he &s;ays,
deprives him even of the u&s;e of his rea&s;on,
I was &s;et very much at ea&s;e on that head,
by receiving a letter from Mr. Davenport;
who told me, that his gue&s;t was at that
very time extremely happy, ea&s;y, chearful, and
even &s;ociable. I &s;aw plainly, in this event,
the u&s;ual infirmity of my friend, who wi&s;hes
to intere&s;t the world in his favour, by pa&s;|&s;ing
for &s;ickly, and per&s;ecuted, and di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed,
and unfortunate, beyond all mea&s;ure,
even while he is the mo&s;t happy and con|tented.
His pretences of an extreme &s;en|&s;ibility
had been too frequently repeated, to
have any effect on a man who was &s;o well
acquainted with them.</P>
<P>I waited three weeks in vain for an an|&s;wer:
I thought this a little &s;trange, and I
even wrote &s;o to Mr. Davenport; but hav|ing
to do with a very odd &s;ort of a man, and
&s;till accounting for his &s;ilence, by &s;uppo&s;ing
him a&s;hamed to write to me, I was re&s;olved
not to be di&s;couraged, nor to lo&s;e the oppor|tunity
of doing him an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, on
account of a vain ceremonial. I accordingly
renewed my applications to the Mini&s;ters,
and was &s;o happy as to be enabled to write

in the &s;ame re&s;olution of refu&s;ing all marks
of his Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s, as long as they

to General Conway to have this con|dition
removed; and I was &s;o fortunate as
to obtain his promi&s;e that he would
&s;peak to the King for that purpo&s;e. It
will only be requi&s;ite, &s;aid he, that we
know previou&s;ly from Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, whe|ther
he would accept of a pen&s;ion publicly
granted him, that his Maje&s;ty may not be
expo&s;ed to a &s;econd refu&s;al. He gave me
authority to write to you on that &s;ubject; and
I beg to hear your re&s;olution as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible.
If you give your con&s;ent, which I
earne&s;tly intreat you to do, I know, that I
could depend on the good offices of the
Duke of Richmond, to &s;econd General
Conway's application; &s;o that I have no

<P>I Imagined, Sir, that my &s;ilence, truly in|terpreted
by your own con&s;cience, had
&s;aid enough; but &s;ince you have &s;ome de|&s;ign
in not under&s;tanding me, I &s;hall &s;peak.
You have but ill di&s;gui&s;ed your&s;elf. I know
you, and you are not ignorant of it. Before
we had any per&s;onal connections, quarrels,
or di&s;putes; while we knew each other
only by literary reputation, you affectionately
made me the offer of the good offices of
your&s;elf and friends. Affected by this ge|nero&s;ity,
I threw my&s;elf into your arms;
you brought me to England, apparently to
procure me an a&s;ylum, but in fact to bring
me to di&s;honour. You applied to this noble
work, with a zeal worthy of your heart, and
a &s;ucce&s;s worthy of your abilities. You
needed not have taken &s;o much pains: you
live and conver&s;e with the world; I with my|&s;elf
in &s;olitude. The public love to be de|ceived,
and you were formed to deceive them.
I know one man, however, whom you can
not deceive; I mean your&s;elf. You know
with what horrour my heart rejected the
<PB N="30" REF="37">
fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of your de&s;igns. You know
I embraced you with tears in my eyes, and
told you, if you were not the be&s;t of men,
you mu&s;t be the blacke&s;t of mankind. In
reflecting on your private conduct, you mu&s;t
&s;ay to your&s;elf &s;ometimes, you are not the
be&s;t of men: under which conviction, I
doubt much if ever you will be the happie&s;t.</P>
<P>I leave your friends and you to carry on
your &s;chemes as you plea&s;e; giving up to
you, without regret, my reputation during
life; certain that &s;ooner or later ju&s;tice will
be done to that of both. As to your good
offices in matters of intere&s;t, which you
have made u&s;e of as a ma&s;k, I thank you
for them, and &s;hall di&s;pen&s;e with profiting
by them. I ought not to hold a corre&s;pond|ence
with you any longer, or to accept of
it to my advantage in any affair in which
you are to be the mediator. Adieu, Sir, I
wi&s;h you the true&s;t happine&s;s; but as we
ought not to have any thing to &s;ay to each
other for the future, this is the la&s;t letter
you will receive from me.</P>

<P>AS I am con&s;cious of having ever acted
towards you the mo&s;t friendly part,
of having always given the mo&s;t tender, the
mo&s;t active proofs of &s;incere affection; you
may judge of my extreme &s;urprize on per|u&s;ing
your epi&s;tle. Such violent accu&s;ations,
confined altogether to generals, it is as im|po&s;&s;ible
to an&s;wer, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to com|prehend
them. But affairs cannot, mu&s;t
not remain on that footing. I &s;hall chari|tably
&s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome infamous calumni|ator
has belied me to you. But in that ca&s;e,
it is your duty, and I am per&s;uaded it will
be your inclination, to give me an oppor|tunity
of detecting him, and of ju&s;tifying
my&s;elf; which can only be done by your
mentioning the particulars of which I am
accu&s;ed. You &s;ay, that I my&s;elf know
that I have been fal&s;e to you; but I &s;ay it
loudly, and will &s;ay it to the whole world,
that I know the contrary, that I know my
friend&s;hip towards you has been unbounded
and uninterrupted, and that though in&s;tances
of it have been very generally remarked
both in France and England, the &s;malle&s;t part
of it only has as yet come to the knowlege
<PB N="32" REF="39">
of the public. I demand, that you will
produce me the man who will a&s;&s;ert the
contrary; and above all, I demand, that he
will mention any one particular in which I
have been wanting to you. You owe this
to me; you owe it to your&s;elf; you owe it
to truth, and honour, and ju&s;tice, and to
every thing that can be deemed &s;acred among
men. As an innocent man; I will not &s;ay,
as your friend; I will not &s;ay, as your bene|factor;
but, I repeat it, as an innocent
man, I claim the privilege of proving my
innocence, and of refuting any &s;candalous
lie which may have been invented again&s;t
me. Mr. Davenport, to whom I have &s;ent
a copy of your letter, and who will read this
before he delivers it, I am confident, will &s;e|cond
my demand, and will tell you, that no|thing
po&s;&s;ibly can be more equitable. Happily
I have pre&s;erved the letter you wrote me after
your arrival at Wooton; and you there ex|pre&s;s
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, indeed in terms
too &s;trong, your &s;atisfaction in my poor en|deavours
to &s;erve you: the little epi&s;tolary
intercour&s;e which afterwards pa&s;&s;ed between
us, has been all employed on my &s;ide to the
mo&s;t friendly purpo&s;es. Tell me, what has
&s;ince given you offence? Tell me of what
I am accu&s;ed. Tell me the man who ac|cu&s;es
me. Even after you have fulfilled all
the&s;e conditions, to my &s;atisfaction, and to
<PB N="33" REF="40">
that of Mr. Davenport, you will have great
difficulty to ju&s;tify the employing &s;uch out|rageous
terms towards a man, with whom
you have been &s;o intimately connected, and
whom, on many accounts, you ought to
have treated with &s;ome regard and decency.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport knows the whole tran&s;ac|tion
about your pen&s;ion, becau&s;e I thought it
nece&s;&s;ary that the per&s;on who had under|taken
your &s;ettlement, &s;hould be fully ac|quainted
with your circum&s;tances; le&s;t he
&s;hould be tempted to perform towards you
concealed acts of genero&s;ity, which, if they
accidentally came to your knowlege, might
give you &s;ome grounds of offence. I am,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM indi&s;po&s;ed, and little in a &s;ituation
to write; but you require an explana|tion,
and it mu&s;t be given you: it was your
own fault you had it not long &s;ince; but
you did not de&s;ire it, and I was therefore
&s;ilent: at pre&s;ent you do, and I have &s;ent
it. I will be a long one, for which I am
very &s;orry; but I have much to &s;ay, and
would put an end to the &s;ubject at once.</P>
<P>As I live retired from the world, I am
ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es in it. I have no
party, no a&s;&s;ociates, no intrigues; I am told
nothing, and I know only what I feel. But
as care hath been taken to make me &s;everely
feel; that I well know. The fir&s;t concern
of tho&s;e who engage in bad de&s;igns is to &s;e|cure
them&s;elves from legal proofs of detec|tion:
it would not be very advi&s;eable to &s;eek
a remedy again&s;t them at law. The innate
conviction of the heart admits of another
kind of proof, which influences the &s;enti|ments
of hone&s;t men. You well know the
ba&s;is of mine.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, with great confidence, to
name your accu&s;er. That accu&s;er, Sir, is
<PB N="35" REF="42">
the only man in the world who&s;e te&s;timony
I &s;hould admit again&s;t you; it is your&s;elf. I
&s;hall give my&s;elf up without fear or re&s;erve
to the natural frankne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition;
being an enemy to every kind of artifice, I
&s;hall &s;peak with the &s;ame freedom as if you
were an indifferent per&s;on, on whom I placed
all that confidence which I no longer have
in you. I will give you an hi&s;tory of the
emotions of my heart, and of what produced
them; while, &s;peaking of Mr. Hume in the
third per&s;on, I &s;hall make your&s;elf the judge
of what I ought to think of him. Notwith|&s;tanding
the length of my letter, I &s;hall pur|&s;ue
no other order than that of my ideas,
beginning with the premi&s;es, and ending
with the demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>I quitted Switzerland, wearied out by the
barbarous treatment I had undergone; but
which affected only my per&s;onal &s;ecurity,
while my honour was &s;afe. I was going, as
my heart directed me, to join my Lord Mar|&s;hal;
when I received at Stra&s;burg a mo&s;t af|fectionate
invitation from Mr. Hume, to go
over with him to England; where he pro|mi&s;ed
me the mo&s;t agreeable reception, and
more tranquillity than I have met with. I he|&s;itated
&s;ome time between my old friend and
my new one; in this I was wrong. I pre|ferred
the latter, and in this was &s;till more
&s;o. But the de&s;ire of vi&s;iting in per&s;on a ce|lebrated
<PB N="36" REF="43">
nation, of which I had heard both
&s;o much good and &s;o much ill, prevailed.
A&s;&s;ured I could not lo&s;e George Keith, I
was flattered with the acqui&s;ition of David
Hume. His great merit, extraordinary abi|lities,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed probity of character,
made me de&s;irous of annexing his friend&s;hip
to that with which I was honoured by his
illu&s;trious countryman. Be&s;ides, I gloried
not a little in &s;etting an example to men of
letters, in a &s;incere union between two men
&s;o different in their principles.</P>
<P>Before I had received an invitation from
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and my Lord Mar&s;hal,
undetermined about the place of my retreat,
I had de&s;ired, and obtained by the intere&s;t of
my friends, a pa&s;&s;port from the Court of
France. I made u&s;e of this, and went to
Paris to join Mr. Hume. He &s;aw, and per|haps
&s;aw too much of, the favourable reception
I met with from a great Prince, and I will
venture to &s;ay, of the public. I yielded, as
it was my duty, though with reluctance, to
that eclat; concluding how far it mu&s;t excite
the envy of my enemies. At the &s;ame time,
I &s;aw with plea&s;ure the regard which the
public entertained for Mr. Hume, &s;en&s;ibly
increa&s;ing throughout Paris, on account
of the good work he had undertaken
with re&s;pect to me. Doubtle&s;s he was af|fected
<PB N="37" REF="44">
too; but I know not if it was in the
&s;ame manner as I was.</P>
<P>We &s;et out with one of my friends, who
came to England almo&s;t entirely on my ac|count.
When we were landed at Dover,
tran&s;ported with the thoughts of having &s;et
foot in this land of liberty, under the conduct
of &s;o celebrated a per&s;on, I threw my arms
round his neck, and pre&s;&s;ed him to my heart,
without &s;peaking a &s;yllable; bathing his checks,
as I ki&s;&s;ed them, with tears &s;ufficiently expre&s;|&s;ive.
This was not the only, not the mo&s;t re|markable
in&s;tance I have given him of the ef|fu&s;ions
of an heart full of &s;en&s;ibility. I know not
what he does with the recollection of them,
when that happens; but I have a notion
they mu&s;t be &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome to him.</P>
<P>At our arrival in London, we were migh|tily
care&s;&s;ed and entertained: all ranks of
people eagerly pre&s;&s;ing to give me marks of
their benevolence and e&s;teem. Mr. Hume
pre&s;ented me politely to every body; and it
was natural for me to a&s;cribe to him, as I
did, the be&s;t part of my good reception. My
heart was full of him. I &s;poke in his prai&s;e
to every one, I wrote to the &s;ame purpo&s;e to
all my friends; my attachment to him ga|thering
every day new &s;trength, while his
appeared the mo&s;t affectionate to me; of
which he frequently gave me in&s;tances that
touched me extremely. That of cau&s;ing my
<PB N="38" REF="45">
portrait to be painted, however, was not of
the number. This &s;eemed to me to carry
with it too much the affectation of popula|rity,
and had an air of o&s;tentation which by
no means plea&s;ed me. All this, however,
might have been ea&s;ily excu&s;able, had Mr.
Hume been a man apt to throw away his
money, or had a gallery of pictures with
the portraits of his friends. After all, I freely
confe&s;s, that, on this head, I may be in the
wrong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fact was this. My friend, Mr. Ram&s;ay, a painter of eminence, and a man of merit, propo&s;ed to draw Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's picture; and when he had begun it, told me he intended to make me a pre&s;ent of it. Thus the de&s;ign of having Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's picture drawn did not come from me, nor did it co&s;t me any thing. Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, therefore, is equally contemptible in paying me a compliment for this pretended gallantry, in his letter of the 29th of March, and in converting it into ridicule here. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But what appears to me an act of friend|&s;hip
and genero&s;ity the mo&s;t undoubted and
e&s;timable, in a word, the mo&s;t worthy of
Mr. Hume, was the care he took to &s;olicit
for me, of his own accord, a pen&s;ion from the
King; to which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly I had no right
to a&s;pire. As I was a witne&s;s to the zeal he
exerted in that affair, I was greatly affected
with it. Nothing could flatter me more than
a piece of &s;ervice of that nature; not merely
for the &s;ake of intere&s;t; for, too much at|tached,
<PB N="39" REF="46">
perhaps, to what I actually po&s;&s;e&s;s,
I am not capable of de&s;iring what I have not,
and as I am able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on my labour and
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friends, I covet nothing
more. But the honour of receiving te&s;timo|nies
of the goodne&s;s, I will not &s;ay of &s;o
great a monarch, but of &s;o good a father, &s;o
good a hu&s;band, &s;o good a ma&s;ter, &s;o good
a friend, and above all, &s;o worthy a man,
was &s;en&s;ibly affecting: and when I con&s;ider|ed
farther, that the mini&s;ter who had ob|tained
for me this favour, was a living in&s;tance
of that probity which of all others is the mo&s;t
important to mankind, and at the &s;ame time
hardly ever met with in the only character
wherein it can be u&s;eful, I could not check
the emotions of my pride, at having for my
benefactors three men, who of all the world
I could mo&s;t de&s;ire to have my friends. Thus,
&s;o far from refu&s;ing the pen&s;ion offered me,
I only made one condition nece&s;&s;ary for my
acceptance; this was the con&s;ent of a per&s;on,
whom I could not, without neglecting my
duty, fail to con&s;ult.</P>
<P>Being honoured with the civilities of all
the world, I endeavoured to make a proper
return. In the mean time, my bad &s;tate of
health, and being accu&s;tomed to live in the
country, made my re&s;idence in town very
di&s;agreeable. Immediately country hou&s;es
pre&s;ented them&s;elves in plenty; I had my
<PB N="40" REF="47">
choice of all the counties of England. Mr.
Hume took the trouble to receive the&s;e pro|po&s;als,
and to repre&s;ent them to me; accom|panying
me to two or three in the neighbour|ing
counties. I he&s;itated a good while in my
choice, and he increa&s;ed the difficulty of de|termination.
At length, I fixed on this
place, and immediately Mr. Hume &s;ettled
the affair; all difficulties vani&s;hed, and I de|parted;
arriving pre&s;ently at this &s;olitary, con|venient,
and agreeable habitation; where the
owner of the hou&s;e provides every thing, and
nothing is wanting. I became tranquil, in|dependant;
and this &s;eemed to be the wi&s;hed
for moment, when all my misfortunes &s;hould
have an end. On the contrary, it was now
they began; misfortunes more cruel than any
I had yet experienced.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;poken in the fulne&s;s of
my heart, and to do ju&s;tice, with the greate&s;t
plea&s;ure, to the good offices of Mr. Hume.
Would to Heaven that what remains for me
to &s;ay were of the &s;ame nature! It would
never give me pain to &s;peak what would re|dound
to his honour; nor is it proper to &s;et
a value on benefits till one is accu&s;ed of in|gratitude;
which is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. I
will venture to make one ob&s;ervation, there|fore,
which renders it nece&s;&s;ary. In e&s;ti|mating
the &s;ervices of Mr. Hume, by the
time and the pains they took him up, they
<PB N="41" REF="48">
were of an infinite value, and that &s;till more
from the good-will di&s;played in their per|formance;
but for the actual &s;ervice they
were of to me, it was much more in ap|pearance
than reality. I did not come over
to beg my bread in England; I brought the
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with me. I came merely
to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in a country which is open
to every &s;tranger without di&s;tinction. I was,
be&s;ides, not &s;o totally unknown as that, if I
had arrived alone, I &s;hould have wanted either
a&s;&s;i&s;tance or &s;ervice. If &s;ome per&s;ons have
&s;ought my acquaintance for the &s;ake of Mr.
Hume, others have &s;ought it for my own.
Thus when Mr. Davenport, for example,
was &s;o kind as to offer my pre&s;ent retreat, it
was not for the &s;ake of Mr. Hume, whom
he did not know, and whom he &s;aw only in
order to de&s;ire him to make me his obliging
propo&s;al. So that when Mr. Hume endeavours
to alienate from me this worthy man, he
takes that from me which he did not give
me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau forms a wrong judgment of me, and ought to know me better. I have written to Mr. Davenport, even &s;ince our rupture, to engage him to continue his kindne&s;s to his unhappy gue&s;t. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. All the good that hath been done me,
would have been done me nearly the &s;ame
without him, and perhaps better; but the
evil would not have been done me at all: for
<PB N="42" REF="49">
why &s;hould I have enemies in England?
Why are tho&s;e enemies all the friends of Mr.
Hume? Who could have excited their en|mity
again&s;t me? It certainly was not I; who
knew nothing of them, nor ever &s;aw them
in my life: I &s;hould not have had a &s;ingle
enemy had I come to England alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How &s;trange are the effects of a di&s;ordered ima|gination! Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau tells us he is ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es in the world, and yet talks of the enemies he has in England. How does he know this? Where did he &s;ee them? He hath received nothing but marks of bene|ficence and ho&s;pitality. Mr. Walpole is the only per&s;on who hath thrown out a little piece of raillery again&s;t him; but is not therefore his enemy. If Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau could have &s;een things exactly as they are, he would have &s;een that he had no other friend in England but me, and no other enemy but him&s;elf. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have hitherto dwelt upon public and no|torious
facts; which from their own nature,
and my acknowledgment, have made the
greate&s;t eclat. Tho&s;e which are to follow
are particular and &s;ecret, at lea&s;t in their
cau&s;e, and all po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ures have been tak|en
to keep the knowledge of them from the

<P>A very &s;hort time after our arrival in Lon|don,
I ob&s;erved an ab&s;urd change in the
minds of the people regarding me, which
&s;oon became very apparent. Before I arrived
<PB N="43" REF="50">
in England, there was not a nation in Eu|rope
in which I had a greater reputation, I
will venture to &s;ay, was held in greater e&s;ti|mation.
The public papers were full of en|comiums
on me, and a general outcry pre|vailed
on my per&s;ecutors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a general outcry &s;hould prevail again&s;t Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's per&s;ecutors in England is no wonder: &s;uch an outcry would have prevailed from &s;entiments of hu|manity, had he been a per&s;on of much le&s;s note; &s;o that this is no proof of his being e&s;teemed: and as to the enco|miums on him in&s;erted in the public news papers, the va|lue of &s;uch kind of puffs is well known in England. I have already ob&s;erved that the authors of more re&s;pectable works were at no lo&s;s what to think of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau; but had formed a proper judgment of him long before his arrival in England. The genius which di&s;played it&s;elf in his writings, did, by no means, blind the eyes of the more &s;en&s;ible part of mankind to the ab&s;urdity and incon&s;i&s;tency of his opinions and conduct. In exclaim|ing again&s;t Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's fanatical per&s;ecutors, they did not think him the more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the true &s;pirit of mar|tyrdom. The general opinion indeed, was, that he had too much philo&s;ophy to be very devout, and had too much devotion to have much philo&s;ophy.
<BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. This was the
ca&s;e at my arrival, which was publi&s;hed in
the news papers with triumph; England
prided it&s;elf in affording me refuge, and
ju&s;tly gloried on that occa&s;ion in its laws and
government: when, all of a &s;udden, without
the lea&s;t a&s;&s;ignable cau&s;e, the tone was
changed; and that &s;o &s;peedily and totally,
that of all the caprices of the public, never
<PB N="44" REF="51">
was known any thing more &s;urprizing. The
&s;ignal was given in a certain <HI>Magazine,</HI>
equally full of follies and fal&s;hoods, in which
the author, being well informed, or pretend|ing
to be &s;o, gives me out for the &s;on of a
mu&s;ician. From this time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau knows very little of the public judg|ment in England, if he thinks it is to be influenced by any &s;tory told in a certain Magazine. But, as I have before &s;aid, it was not from this time that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau was &s;lightingly &s;poke of, but long before; and that in a more con&s;equential manner. Perhaps, indeed, Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau ought in ju&s;tice to impute great part of tho&s;e civilities he met with on his arrival, rather to vanity and curio&s;ity than to re&s;pect and e&s;teem.
<BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, I was con|&s;tantly
&s;poken of in print in a very equivocal
or &s;lighting manner. Every thing that had
been publi&s;hed concerning my misfortunes
was mi&s;repre&s;ented, altered, or placed in a
wrong light, and always as much as po&s;&s;ible
to my di&s;advantage. So far was any body
from &s;peaking of the reception I met with at
Paris, and which had made but too much
noi&s;e, it was not generally &s;uppo&s;ed that I
dur&s;t have appeared in that city; even one of
Mr. Hume's friends being very much &s;ur|prized
when I told him I came through it.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed as I had been too much to
the incon&s;tancy of the public, to be affected
by this in&s;tance of it, I could not help being
a&s;toni&s;hed, however, at a change, &s;o very
<PB N="45" REF="52">
&s;udden and general, that not one of tho&s;e
who had &s;o much prai&s;ed me in my ab&s;ence,
appeared, now I was pre&s;ent, to think even
of my exi&s;tence. I thought it &s;omething
very odd that, immediately after the return of
Mr. Hume, who had &s;o much credit in Lon|don,
with &s;o much influence over the book|&s;ellers
and men of letters, and &s;uch great
connections with them, his pre&s;ence &s;hould
produce an effect &s;o contrary to what might
have been expected; that among &s;o many
writers of every kind, not one of his friends
&s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf to be mine; while it
was ea&s;y to be &s;een, that tho&s;e who &s;poke
of him were not his enemies, &s;ince, in no|ticing
his public character, they reported
that I had come through France under his
protection, and by favour of a pa&s;&s;port
which he had obtained of the court; nay,
they almo&s;t went &s;o far as to in&s;inuate, that
I came over in his retinue, and at his ex|pence.
All this was of little &s;ignifica|tion,
and was only &s;ingular; but what
was much more &s;o, was, that his friends
changed their tone with me as much as the
public. I &s;hall always take a plea&s;ure in
&s;aying that they were &s;till equally &s;olicitous
to &s;erve me, and that they exerted them&s;elves
greatly in my favour; but &s;o far were they
from &s;hewing me the &s;ame re&s;pect, particularly
the gentleman at who&s;e hou&s;e we alighted
<PB N="46" REF="53">
on our arrival, that he accompanied all his
actions with di&s;cour&s;e &s;o rude, and &s;ometimes
&s;o in&s;ulting, that one would have thought
he had taken an occa&s;ion to oblige me,
merely to have a right to expre&s;s his con|tempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This relates to my friend Mr. John Stewart, who entertained Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau at his hou&s;e, and did him all the good offices in his power. Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, in com|plaining of this gentleman's behaviour, forgets that he wrote Mr. Stewart a letter from Wooton, full of ac|knowlegements, and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. What Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau adds, regarding the brother of Mr. Stewart, is neither civil nor true.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.
His brother, who was at fir&s;t
very polite and obliging, altered his beha|viour
with &s;o little re&s;erve, that he would
hardly deign to &s;peak a &s;ingle word to me
even in their own hou&s;e, in return to a civil
&s;alutation, or to pay any of tho&s;e civilities
which are u&s;ually paid in like circum&s;tances
to &s;trangers. Nothing new had happened,
however, except the arrival of J. J. Rou&s;|&s;eau
and David Hume: and certainly the
cau&s;e of the&s;e alterations did not come from
me, unle&s;s indeed too great a portion of &s;im|plicity,
di&s;cretion, and mode&s;ty, be the
cau&s;e of offence in England. As to Mr.
Hume, he was &s;o far from a&s;&s;uming &s;uch a
di&s;gu&s;ting tone, that he gave into the other
extreme. I have always looked upon flat|terers
<PB N="47" REF="54">
with an eye of &s;u&s;picion: and he was
&s;o full of all kinds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall mention only one, that made me &s;mile; this was, his attention to have, every time I came to &s;ee him, a volume of <HI>Elci&s;a</HI> upon his table; as if I did not know enough of Mr. Hume's ta&s;te for reading, as to be well a&s;&s;ured, that of all books in the world, Eloi&s;a mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t tire&s;ome to him.
<BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE> of flattery, that he
even obliged me, when I could bear it no
longer<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader may judge from the two fir&s;t letters of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, which I publi&s;hed with that view, on which &s;ide the &s;latteries commenced. As for the re&s;t, I loved and e&s;teemed Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, and took a plea|&s;ure in giving him to under&s;tand &s;o. I might perhaps be too lavi&s;h in my prai&s;es; but I can a&s;&s;ure the reader he never once complained of it.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, to tell him my &s;entiments on that
head. His behaviour was &s;uch as to render
few words nece&s;&s;ary, yet I could have wi&s;h|ed
he had &s;ub&s;tituted, in the room of &s;uch
gro&s;s encomiums, &s;ometimes the language
of a friend; but I never found any thing in
his, which favoured of true friend&s;hip, not
even in his manner of &s;peaking of me to
others in my pre&s;ence. One would have
thought that, in endeavouring to procure
me patrons, he &s;trove to deprive me of their
good-will; that he &s;ought rather to have
me a&s;&s;i&s;ted than loved; and I have been
&s;ometimes &s;urprized at the rude turn he
<PB N="48" REF="55">
hath given to my behaviour before people
who might not unrea&s;onably have taken of|fence
at it. I &s;hall give an example of what
I mean. Mr. Pennick of the Mu&s;eum, a
friend of my Lord Mar&s;hal's, and mini&s;ter
of a pari&s;h where I was &s;olicited to refide,
came to &s;ee me. Mr. Hume made my ex|cu&s;es,
while I my&s;elf was pre&s;ent, for not
having paid him a vi&s;it. Doctor Matty,
&s;aid he, invited us on Thur&s;day to the Mu|&s;eum,
where Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau &s;hould have &s;een
you; but he cho&s;e rather to go with Mrs.
Garrick to the play: we could not do both
the &s;ame day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I don't recollect a &s;ingle circum&s;tance of this hi&s;|tory; but what makes me give very little credit to it, is, that I remember very well we had &s;ettled two dif|ferent days for the purpo&s;es mentioned, that is, one to go to the Mu&s;eum, and another to the play.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. You will confe&s;s, Sir, this
was a &s;trange method of recommending me
to Mr. Pennick.</P>
<P>I know not what Mr. Hume might &s;ay
in private of me to his acquaintance, but
nothing was more extraordinary than their
behaviour to me, even by his own confe&s;|&s;ion,
and even often through his own means.
Although my pur&s;e was not empty, and I
needed not that of any other per&s;on; which
he very well knew; yet any one would have
thought I was come over to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the
<PB N="49" REF="56">
charity of the public, and that nothing
more was to be done than to give me alms
in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ave me a little con|fu&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I conceive Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau hints here at two or three dinners, that were &s;ent him from the hou&s;e of Mr. Steward, when he cho&s;e to dine at his own lodg|ings; this was not done, however, to &s;ave him the expence of a meal, but becau&s;e there was no conve|nient tavern or chop-hou&s;e in the neighbourhood. I beg the reader's pardon for de&s;cending to &s;uch trivial particulars. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.
I mu&s;t own, this con&s;tant and
in&s;olent piece of affectation was one of tho&s;e
things which made me aver&s;e to re&s;ide in
London. This certainly was not the foot|ing
on which any man &s;hould have been in|troduced
in England, had there been a de|&s;ign
of procuring him ever &s;o little re&s;pect.
This di&s;play of charity, however, may ad|mit
of a more favourable interpretation, and
I con&s;ent it &s;hould. To proceed.</P>
<P>At Paris was publi&s;hed a fictitious letter
from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, addre&s;&s;ed to me,
and replete with the mo&s;t cruel malignity.
I learned with &s;urprize that it was one Mr.
Walpole, a friend of Mr. Hume's, who was
the editor; I a&s;ked him if it were true; in
an&s;wer to which que&s;tion, he only a&s;ked me,
of whom I had the information. A mo|ment
before he had given me a card for this
&s;ame Mr. Walpole, written to engage him
<PB N="50" REF="57">
to bring over &s;uch papers as related to me
from Paris, and which I wanted to have by
a &s;afe hand.</P>
<P>I was informed that the &s;on of that
quack<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have not been authorized to &s;uppre&s;s this af|fronting term; but it is too gro&s;s and groundle&s;s to do any injury to the celebrated and re&s;pectable phy&s;ician to who&s;e name it is annexed.

which we were received by the landladies,

All the&s;e facts put together, added to a
certain appearance of things on the whole,
in&s;en&s;ibly gave me an unea&s;ine&s;s, which I re|jected
with horror. In the mean time, I
found the letters I wrote did not come to
hand; tho&s;e I received had often been open|ed;
and all went through the hands of Mr.
Hume<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;tory of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's letters is as follows. He had often been complaining to me, and with rea|&s;on, that he was ruined by po&s;tage at Neuf-chatel, which commonly co&s;t him 25 or 26 louis d'ors a year; and all for letters which were of no &s;ignificance, being wrote, &s;ome of them by people who took that oppor|tunity of abu&s;ing him, and mo&s;t of them by per&s;ons unknown to him: he was therefore re&s;olved, he &s;aid, in England to receive no letters which came by the po&s;t; and the &s;ame re&s;olution he re-iterates in his letter to me dated the 22d of March. When he went to Chi&s;wick, near London, the po&s;t-man brought his letters to me. I carried him out a cargo of them: he exclaimed, de&s;ired me to return the letters, and recover the price of po&s;tage: I told him, that in that ca&s;e, the clerks of the po&s;t-office were entire ma&s;ters of his let|ters: he &s;aid, he was indifferent; they might do with them what they plea&s;ed. I added, that he would by that means be cut off from all corre&s;pondence with all his friends: he replied, that he would give a particular direction to &s;uch as he de&s;ired to corre&s;pond with. But till his in&s;tructions for that purpo&s;e could arrive, what could I do more friendly, than to &s;ave, at my own ex|pence, his letters from the curio&s;ity and indi&s;cretion of the clerks of the po&s;t-office? I am indeed a&s;hamed to find my&s;elf obliged to di&s;cover &s;uch petty circum&s;tances.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. If at any time any one e&s;caped
<PB N="52" REF="59">
him, he could not conceal his eagerne&s;s to
&s;ee it. One evening in particular I remem|ber
a very remarkable circum&s;tance of this
kind, that greatly &s;truck me<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is nece&s;&s;ary to explain this circum&s;tance. I had been writing on Mr. Hume's table, during his ab&s;ence, an an&s;wer to a letter I had ju&s;t received. He came in, very curious to know what I had been writing, and hardly able to contain him&s;elf from de&s;iring to read it. I clo&s;ed my letter, however, without &s;hewing it him; when, as I was putting it into my pocket, he a&s;ked me for it eagerly, &s;aying, he would &s;end it away on the morrow, being po&s;t-day. The letter lay on the table. Lord Newnham came in. Mr. Hume went out of the room for a moment; on which I took the letter up again, &s;aying I &s;hould find time to &s;end it the next day. Lord Newnham offered to get it inclo&s;ed in the French amba&s;|&s;ador's packet; which I accepted. Mr. Hume re-entered the moment his lord&s;hip had inclo&s;ed it, and was pulling out his &s;eal. Mr. Hume officiou&s;ly offered his own &s;eal, and that with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that it could not well be refu&s;ed. The bell was rung, and Lord Newnham gave the letter to Mr. Hume's &s;ervant, to give it his own, who waited below with the chariot, in order to have it &s;ent to the amba&s;&s;ador. Mr. Hume's &s;ervant was hardly got out of the room, but I &s;aid to my&s;elf, I'll lay a wager the ma&s;ter follows. He did not fail to do as I expected. Not knowing how to leave Lord Newn|ham alone, I &s;taid &s;ome time, before I followed Mr. Hume. I &s;aid nothing; but he mu&s;t perceive that I was unea&s;y. Thus, although I have received no an|&s;wer to my letter, I doubt not of its going to hand; but I confe&s;s, I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting it was read fir&s;t. <BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>. As we
were &s;itting one evening, after &s;upper, &s;ilent
by the fire-&s;ide, I caught his eyes intently
fixed on mine, as indeed happened very
<PB N="53" REF="60">
often; and that in a manner of which it is
very difficult to give an idea; at that time
he gave me a &s;tedfa&s;t, piercing look, mixed
with a &s;neer, which greatly di&s;turbed me.
To get rid of the embarra&s;sment I lay under,
I endeavoured to look full at him in my
turn; but, in fixing my eyes again&s;t his,
I felt the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible terror, and was
obliged &s;oon to turn them away. The &s;peech
and phy&s;iognomy of the good David is that
of an hone&s;t man; but where, great God!
did this good man borrow tho&s;e eyes he fixes
&s;o &s;ternly and unaccountably on tho&s;e of his
friends!</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion of this look remained
with me, and gave me much unea&s;ine&s;s.
My trouble increa&s;ed even to a degree of
fainting; and if I had not been relieved by
an effu&s;ion of tears, I had been &s;uffocated.
Pre&s;ently after this I was &s;eized with the
mo&s;t violent remor&s;e; I even de&s;pi&s;ed my|&s;elf;
till at length, in a tran&s;port, which I
&s;till remember with delight, I &s;prang on his
neck, embraced him eagerly; while almo&s;t
choked with &s;obbing, and bathed in tears, I
cried out, in broken accents, <HI>No, no, David
Hume cannot be treacherous; if he be not the
be&s;t of men, he must be the ba&s;e&s;t of mankind.</HI>
David Hume politely returned my embraces,
and gently tapping me on the back, repeat|ed
&s;everal times, in a good-natured and ea&s;y
<PB N="54" REF="61">
tone, <HI>Why, what my dear Sir! Nay, my
dear Sir ! Oh! my dear Sir!</HI> He &s;aid no|thing
more. I felt my heart yearn within
me. We went to bed; and I &s;et out the
next day for the country.</P>
<P>Arrived at this agreeable a&s;ylum, to which
I have travelled &s;o far in &s;earch of repo&s;e, I
ought to find it in a retired, convenient, and
plea&s;ant habitation; the ma&s;ter of which, a
man of under&s;tanding and worth, &s;pares
for nothing to render it agreeable to me.
But what repo&s;e can be ta&s;ted in life, when
the heart is agitated? Afflicted with the
mo&s;t cruel uncertainty, and ignorant what
to think of a man whom I ought to love
and e&s;teem, I endeavoured to get rid of that
fatal doubt, in placing confidence in my be|nefactor.
For, wherefore, from what un|accountable
caprice &s;hould be di&s;play &s;o
much apparent zeal for my happine&s;s, and
at the &s;ame time entertain &s;ecret de&s;igns
again&s;t my honour. Among the &s;everal ob|&s;ervations
that di&s;turbed me, each fact was
in it&s;elf of no great moment; it was their
concurrence that was &s;urprizing; yet I
thought, perhaps, that Mr. Hume, inform|ed
of other facts, of which I was ignorant,
could have given me a &s;atisfactory &s;olution
of them, had we come to an explana|tion.
The only thing that was inexpli|cable,
was, that he refu&s;ed to come to &s;uch
<PB N="55" REF="62">
an explanation; which both his honour
and his friend&s;hip rendered equally nece&s;&s;ary.
I &s;aw very well there was &s;omething in the
affair which I did not comprehend, and
which I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to know. Before
I came to an ab&s;olute determination, there|fore,
with regard to him, I was de&s;irous
of making another effort, and to try to
recover him, if he had permitted him&s;elf
to be &s;educed by my enemies, or in &s;hort to
prevail on him to explain him&s;elf one way
or other. Accordingly I wrote him a letter,
which he ought to have found very na|tural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears from what he wrote to me afterwards, that he was very well &s;atisfied with this letter, and that he thought of it very well. <BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>,
if he were guilty; but very extra|ordinary,
if he were innocent. For what
could be more extraordinary than a letter
full of gratitude for his &s;ervices, and at the
&s;ame time, of di&s;tru&s;t of his &s;entiments;
and in which, placing in a manner his
actions on one &s;ide, and his &s;entiments on
the other, in&s;tead of &s;peaking of the proofs
of friend&s;hip he had given me, I de&s;ired
him to love me, for the good he had done
me<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My an&s;wer to this is contained in Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's own letter of the 22d of March; wherein he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t cordiality, without any re|&s;erve, and without the lea&s;t appearance of &s;u&s;picion.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>? I did not take the precaution to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="56" REF="63">
a copy of this letter; but as he hath
done it, let him produce it: and whoever
&s;hall read it, and &s;ee therein a man labour|ing
under a &s;ecret trouble, which he is de|&s;irous
of expre&s;&s;ing, and is afraid to do it,
will, I am per&s;uaded, be curious to know
what kind of eclairci&s;&s;ement it produced,
e&s;pecially after the preceeding &s;cene. None.
Ab&s;olutely none at all. Mr. Hume con|tented
him&s;elf, in his an&s;wer, with only
&s;peaking of the obliging offices Mr. Daven|port
propo&s;ed to do for me. As for the re&s;t,
he &s;aid not a word of the principal &s;ubject of
my letter, nor of the &s;ituation of my heart,
of who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s he could not be ignorant.
I was more &s;truck with this &s;ilence, than I
had been with his phlegm during our la&s;t con|ver&s;ation.
In this I was wrong; this &s;ilence
was very natural after the other, and was no
more than I ought to have expected. For
when one hath ventured to declare to man's
face, <HI>I am tempted to believe you a traitor,</HI>
and he hath not the curio&s;ity to a&s;k you <HI>for
what</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this hangs upon the fable he had &s;o artfully worked up, as I before ob&s;erved. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, it may be depended on he will never
have any &s;uch curio&s;ity as long as he lives;
and it is ea&s;y to judge of him from the&s;e &s;light
indications.</P>
<P>After the receipt of his letter, which was
long delayed, I determined at length to write
<PB N="57" REF="64">
to him no more. Soon after, every thing
&s;erved to confirm me in the re&s;olution to
break off all farther corre&s;pondence with him.
Curious to the la&s;t degree concerning the
minute&s;t circum&s;tance of my affairs, he was
not content to learn them of me, in our fre|quent
conver&s;ations; but, as I learned, ne|ver
let &s;lip an opportunity of being alone
with my governante<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I had only one &s;uch opportunity with his gover|nante, which was on their arrival in London. I mu&s;t own it never entered into my head to talk to her upon any other &s;ubject than the concerns of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, to interrogate her
even importunately concerning my occupa|tions,
my re&s;ources, my friends, acquaint|ances,
their names, &s;ituations, place of abode,
and all this after &s;etting out with telling her
he was well acquainted with the whole of
my connections; nay, with the mo&s;t je&s;u|itical
addre&s;s, he would a&s;k the &s;ame que&s;|tions
of us &s;eparately. One ought undoubt|edly
to intere&s;t one's &s;elf in the affairs of a
friend; but one ought to be &s;atisfied with
what he thinks proper to let us know of them,
particularly when people are &s;o frank and in|genuous
as I am. Indeed all this petty inqui|&s;itivene&s;s
is very little becoming a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time I received two other
letters which had been opened. The one
from Mr. Bo&s;well, the &s;eal of which was &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="65">
loo&s;e and disfigured, that Mr. Davenport,
when he received it, remarked the &s;ame to
Mr. Hume's &s;ervant. The other was from
Mr. d'Ivernois, in Mr. Hume's packet, and
which had been &s;ealed up again by means of
a hot iron, which, aukwardly applied, had
burnt the paper round the impre&s;&s;ion. On
this, I wrote to Mr. Davenport to de&s;ire
him to take charge of all the letters which
might be &s;ent for me, and to tru&s;t none of
them in any body's hands, under any pretext
whatever. I know not whether Mr. Daven|port,
who certainly was far from thinking
that precaution was to be ob&s;erved with re|gard
to Mr. Hume, &s;howed him my letter
or not; but this I know, that the latter had
all the rea&s;on in the world to think he had
forfeited my confidence, and that he pro|ceeded
neverthele&s;s in his u&s;ual manner,
without troubling him&s;elf about the recovery
of it.</P>
<P>But what was to become of me, when I
&s;aw, in the public papers, the pretended letter
of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, which I had never
before &s;een, that fictitious letter, printed in
French and Engli&s;h, given for genuine, even
with the &s;ignature of the King, and in which
I knew the pen of Mr. d'Alembert as cer|tainly
as if I had &s;een him write it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. d'Alembert's declaration on this head, an|nexed to this narrative.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="66">
In a moment a ray of light di&s;covered to
me the &s;ecret cau&s;e of that touching and &s;ud|den
change, which I had ob&s;erved in the
public re&s;pecting me; and I &s;aw the plot
which was put in execution at London, had
been laid in Paris.</P>
<P>Mr. d'Alembert, another intimate friend
of Mr. Hume's, had been long &s;ince my
&s;ecret enemy, and lay in watch for opportu|nities
to injure me without expo&s;ing him&s;elf.
He was the only per&s;on, among the men of
letters, of my old acquaintance, who did
not come to &s;ee me<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau declares him&s;elf to have been fatigued with the vi&s;its he received; ought he therefore to complain that Mr. d'Alembert, whom he did not like, did not importune him with his? <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, or &s;end their civilities
during my la&s;t pa&s;&s;age through Paris. I
knew his &s;ecret di&s;po&s;ition, but I gave my|&s;elf
very little trouble about it, content|ing
my&s;elf with advi&s;ing my friends of it
occa&s;ionally. I remember that being a&s;ked
about him one day by Mr. Hume, who
afterwards a&s;ked my governante the &s;ame
que&s;tion, I told him that Mr. d'Alembert
was a cunning, artful man. He contradicted
me with a warmth that &s;urprized me; not
then knowing they &s;tood &s;o well with each
other, and that it was his own cau&s;e he de|fended.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">
The peru&s;al of the letter above mentioned
alarmed me a good deal, when, perceiving
that I had been brought over to England in
con&s;equence of a project which began to be
put in execution, but of the end of which I
was ignorant, I felt the danger without
knowing what to guard again&s;t, or on whom
to rely. I then recollected four terrify|ing
words Mr. Hume had made u&s;e of, and
of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. What could
be thought of a paper in which my misfor|tunes
were imputed to me as a crime, which
tended, in the mid&s;t of my di&s;tre&s;s, to de|prive
me of all compa&s;&s;ion, and, to render
its effects &s;till more cruel, pretended to have
been written by a Prince who had afforded
me protection? What could I divine would
be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a beginning?
The people in England read the public pa|pers,
and are in no wi&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour
of foreigners. Even a coat, cut in a dif|ferent
fa&s;hion from their own, is &s;ufficient
to excite a prejudice again&s;t them. What then
had not a poor &s;tranger to expect in his rural
walks, the only plea&s;ures of his life, when
the good people in the neighbourhood were
once thoroughly per&s;uaded he was fond of
being per&s;ecuted and pelted? Doubtle&s;s they
would be ready enough to contribute to his
favourite amu&s;ement. But my concern, my
profound and cruel concern, the bittere&s;t in|deed
<PB N="61" REF="68">
I ever felt, did not ari&s;e from the dan|ger
to which I was per&s;onally expo&s;ed. I
had braved too many others to be much
moved with that. The treachery of a fal&s;e
friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>fal&s;e friend,</HI> is, undoubtedly, my&s;elf. But what is the treachery? What harm have I done, or could I do to Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau? On the &s;uppo&s;ition of my entering into a project to ruin him, how could I think to bring it about by the &s;ervices I did him? If Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau &s;hould gain credit, I mu&s;t be thought &s;till more weak than wicked. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE> to which I had fallen a prey, was
the circum&s;tance that filled my too &s;u&s;|ceptible
heart with deadly &s;orrow. In the
impetuo&s;ity of its fir&s;t emotions, of which I
never yet was ma&s;ter, and of which my ene|mies
have artfully taken the advantage, I
wrote &s;everal letters full of di&s;order, in which
I did not di&s;gui&s;e either my anxiety or indig|nation.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, &s;o many things to mention,
that I forget half of them by the way. For
in&s;tance, a certain narrative in form of a let|ter,
concerning my manner of living at
Montmorency, was given by the book&s;ellers
to Mr. Hume, who &s;hewed it me. I agreed
to its being printed, and Mr. Hume under|took
the care of its edition; but it never ap|peared.
Again, I had brought over with me
a copy of the letters of Mr. du Peyrou, con|taining
a relation of the treatment I had met
<PB N="62" REF="69">
with at Neu&s;chatel. I gave them into the
hands of the &s;ame book&s;eller to have them
tran&s;lated and reprinted. Mr. Hume charged
him&s;elf with the care of them; but they ne|ver
appeared<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The book&s;ellers have lately informed me that the edition is fini&s;hed, and will &s;hortly be publi&s;hed. This may be; but it is too late, and what is &s;till wor&s;e, it is too opportune for the purpo&s;e intended to be &s;erved.
<BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>. The &s;uppo&s;ititious letter of
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and its tran&s;lation, had
no &s;ooner made their appearance, than I im|mediately
comprehended why the other
pieces had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is about four months &s;ince Mr. Becket, the book&s;eller, told Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau that the publication of the&s;e pieces was delayed on account of the indi&s;po&s;ition of the tran&s;lator. As for any thing el&s;e, I never pro|mi&s;ed to take any change at all of the edition, as Mr. Becket can testify. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, and I wrote as
much to the book&s;ellers<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">As to Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's &s;u&s;picions of the cau&s;e of the <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as he calls it, of the Narrative and Letters above mentioned, the tran&s;lator thinks it incumbent on him to affirm, they were entirely groundle&s;s. It is true, as Mr. Becket told Mr. Hume, that the tran&s;lator of the letters was indi&s;po&s;ed about that time.

With regard to the tran&s;lation of the Narrative of his manner of living at Montmorency, I never &s;aw it till it was actually printed; when Mr. Becket put it into my hands, and I frankly told him that I thought it a very un&s;ea&s;onable, puerile affair, and could by no means &s;erve to advance Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's e&s;timation in the eyes of the public. It was certainly of great importance to the good people of England, to know how Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau amu&s;ed him&s;elf 7 or 8 years ago at Montmorency, that he cooked his own broth, and did not leave it to the management of his nur&s;e, for fear &s;he &s;hould have a better dinner than him&s;elf! Yet this is one of the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tances contained in that narrative, except indeed that we are told, Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau is a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate admirer of virtue, and that his eyes always &s;parkle at the bare mention of that word&mdash;O Virtue! how greatly is thy name pro&s;tituted! And how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, from the teeth outward, are thy nominal votaries!
<BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. I wrote &s;everal
<PB N="63" REF="70">
other letters al&s;o, which probably were
handed about London; till at length I em|ployed
the credit of a man of quality and
merit, to in&s;ert a declaration of the impo&s;ture
in the public papers. In this declaration. I
concealed no part of my extreme concern;
nor did I in the lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;e the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Hume &s;eems to have walked

toward cunning people, than to act ingenu|ou&s;ly;
&s;ooner or later they will infallibly be|tray
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When this pretended letter from the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in London,
Mr. Hume, who certainly knew that it was
fictitious, as I had told him &s;o, yet &s;aid no|thing
of the matter, did not write to me,
but was totally &s;ilent; and did not even think
of making any declaration, of the truth, in
favour of his ab&s;ent friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No body could po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken with regard to the letter's being fictitious; be&s;ides it was well known that Mr. Walpole was the author of it. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. It an&s;wered
his purpo&s;e better to let the report take its
cour&s;e, as he did.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume having been my conductor
into England, he was of cour&s;e in a manner
my patron and protector. If it were but na|tural
in him to undertake my defence, it
was to le&s;s &s;o that, when I had a public
prote&s;tation to make, I &s;hould have addre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf to him. Having already cea&s;ed writ|ing
to him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau forgets him&s;elf here. It was but a week before that he wrote me a very friendly letter. See his letter of the 29th of March. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, however, I had no mind to
renew our corre&s;pondence. I addre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf
therefore to another per&s;on. The fir&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="72">
&s;lap on the face I gave my patron. He felt
nothing of it.</P>
<P>In &s;aying the letter was fabricated at Paris,
it was of very little con&s;equence to me whe|ther
it was under&s;tood particularly of Mr.
d'Alembert, or of Mr. Walpole, who&s;e
name he borrowed on the occa&s;ion. But
in adding that, what afflicted and tore my
heart was, the impo&s;tor had got his accom|plices
in England; I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf very
clearly to their friend, who was in London,
and was de&s;irous of pa&s;&s;ing for mine. For
certainly he was the only per&s;on in England,
who&s;e hatred could afflict and rend my heart.
This was the &s;econd &s;lap of the face I gave
my patron. He did not feel, however, yet.</P>
<P>On the contrary, he maliciou&s;ly pretended
that my affliction aro&s;e &s;olely from the pub|lication
of the above letter, in order to make
me pa&s;s for a man who was exce&s;&s;ively
affected by &s;atire. Whether I am vain or
not, certain it is I was mortally afflicted; he
knew it, and yet wrote me not a word.
This affectionate friend, who had &s;o much
at heart the filling of my pur&s;e, gave him|&s;elf
no trouble to think my heart was bleed|ing
with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Another piece appeared &s;oon after, in the
&s;ame papers, by the author of the former,
and &s;till if po&s;&s;ible more cruel; in which the
writer could not di&s;gui&s;e his rage at the recep|tion
<PB N="66" REF="73">
I met with at Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know nothing of this pretended libel.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. This however did
not affect me; it told me nothing new. Mere
libels may take their cour&s;e without giving
me any emotion; and the incon&s;tant public
may amu&s;e them&s;elves as long as they plea&s;e
with the &s;ubject. It is not an affair of con|&s;pirators,
who, bent on the de&s;truction of
my hone&s;t fame, are determined by &s;ome
means or other to effect it. It was nece&s;&s;ary
to change the battery.</P>
<P>The affair of the pen&s;ion was not deter|mined.
It was not difficult, however, for
Mr. Hume to obtain, from the humanity of
the mini&s;ter, and the genero&s;ity of the King,
the favour of its determination. He was
required to inform me of it, which he did.
This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, was one of the critical
moments of my life. How much did it co&s;t
me to do my duty! My preceding engage|ments,
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing a due re&s;pect
for the goodne&s;s of the King, and for that
of his mini&s;ter, together with the de&s;ire of
di&s;playing how far I was &s;en&s;ible of both;
add to the&s;e the advantage of being made a
little more ea&s;y in circum&s;tances in the de|cline
of life, &s;urrounded as I was by enemies
and evils; in fine, the embarra&s;&s;ment I was
under to find a decent excu&s;e for not accept|ing
<PB N="67" REF="74">
a benefit already half accepted; all the&s;e
together made the nece&s;&s;ity of that refu&s;al very
difficult and cruel: for nece&s;&s;ary it was, or I
&s;hould have been one of the meane&s;t and
ba&s;e&s;t of mankind to have voluntarily laid my|&s;elf
under an obligation to a man who had
betrayed me.</P>
<P>I did my duty, though not without reluc|tance.
I wrote immediately to General Con|way,
and in the mo&s;t civil and re&s;pectful
manner po&s;&s;ible, without giving an ab&s;olute
refu&s;al, excu&s;ing my&s;elf from accepting the
pen&s;ion for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. Hume had been the only ne|gotiator
of this affair, nay the only per&s;on
who had &s;poke of it. Yet I not only did not
give him any an&s;wer, though it was he who
wrote to me on the &s;ubject, but did not even
&s;o much as mention him in my letter to Ge|neral
Conway. This was the third &s;lap of
the face I gave my patron; which if he does
not feel, it is certainly his own fault, he can
feel nothing.</P>
<P>My letter was not clear, nor could it be &s;o
to General Conway, who did not know the
motives of my refu&s;al; but it was very plain
to Mr. Hume, who knew them but too well.
He pretended neverthele&s;s to be deceived as
well with regard to the cau&s;e of my di&s;con|tent,
as to that of my declining the pen&s;ion;
and, in a letter he wrote me on the occa&s;ion,
<PB N="68" REF="75">
gave me to under&s;tand that the king's good|ne&s;s
might be continued towards me, if I
&s;hould recon&s;ider the affair of the pen&s;ion.
In a word he &s;eemed determined, at all
events, to remain &s;till my patron, in &s;pite of
my teeth. You will imagine, Sir, he did
not expect my an&s;wer; and he had none.
Much about this time, for I do not know
exactly the date, nor is &s;uch preci&s;ion nece&s;|&s;ary,
appeared a letter, from Mr. de Voltaire
to me, with an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, which &s;till
improved on the original. The noble object
of this ingenious performance, was to draw on
me the hatred and contempt of the people,
among whom I was come to re&s;ide. I made
not the lea&s;t doubt that my dear patron was
one of the in&s;truments of its publication;
particularly when I &s;aw that the writer, in
endeavouring to alienate from me tho&s;e who
might render my life agreeable, had omitted
the name of him who brought me over.
He doubtle&s;s knew that it was &s;uperfluous,
and that with regard to him, nothing more
was nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid. The omi&s;&s;ion of
his name, &s;o impoliticly forgot in this letter,
recalled to my mind what Tacitus &s;ays of
the picture of Brutus, omitted in a funeral
&s;olemnity, viz. that every body took notice
of it, particularly becau&s;e it was not there.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume was not mentioned; but he
lives and conver&s;es with people that are men|tioned.

pre&s;ence of Mr. Hume<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was not pre&s;ent when Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau received his cou&s;in: I only ju&s;t &s;aw them afterwards together for about a minute on the terrace in Bucking ham-&s;treet.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
be either Mr. Hume or this relation
who furni&s;hed that piece of intelligence.
Now, my cou&s;in, whom I have always
known for a friendly relation, and a worthy
man, is incapable of furni&s;hing materials for
public &s;atires again&s;t me. Add to this, that
his &s;ituation in life confining him to the con|ver&s;ation
of per&s;ons in trade, he has no
connection with men of letters, or para|graph-writers,
and &s;till le&s;s with &s;atiri&s;ts
and libellers. So that the article could not
come from him. At the wor&s;t, can I help
imagining that Mr. Hume mu&s;t have en|deavoured to take advantage of what he &s;aid,
and con&s;trued it in favour of his own pur|po&s;e?
It is not improper to add, that after
my rupture with Mr. Hume, I wrote an
account of it to my cou&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="80">
In fine, it is &s;aid in the &s;ame paper, that
I am apt to change my friends. No great
&s;ubtlety is nece&s;&s;ary to comprehend what
this reflection is preparative to.</P>
<P>But let us di&s;tingui&s;h facts. I have pre|&s;erved
&s;ome very valuable and &s;olid friends
for twenty-five to thirty years. I have
others who&s;e friend&s;hip is of a later date,
but no le&s;s valuable, and which if I live, I
may pre&s;erve &s;till longer. I have not found,
indeed, the &s;ame &s;ecurity in general among
tho&s;e friend&s;hips I have made with men of
letters. I have for this rea&s;on &s;ometimes
changed them, and &s;hall always change
them, when they appear &s;u&s;picious; for I
am determined never to have friends by way
of ceremony; I have them only with a view
to &s;hew them my affection.</P>
<P>If ever I was fully and clearly convinced
of any thing, I am &s;o convinced that Mr.
Hume furni&s;hed the materials for the above
paper.</P>
<P>But what is &s;till more, I have not only
that ab&s;olute conviction, but it is very clear
to me that Mr. Hume intended I &s;hould:
For how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a man of
his &s;ubtlety &s;hould be &s;o imprudent as to ex|po&s;e
him&s;elf thus, if he had not intended
it? What was his de&s;ign in it? Nothing
is more clear than this. It was to rai&s;e my
re&s;entment to the highe&s;t pitch, that he
<PB N="74" REF="81">
might &s;trike the blow he was preparing to
give me with greater eclat. He knew he
had nothing more to do than to put me in a
pa&s;&s;ion, and I &s;hould be guilty of a number
of ab&s;urdities. We are now arrived at the
critical moment which is to &s;hew whether
he rea&s;oned well or ill.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to have all the pre&s;ence of
mind, all the phlegm and re&s;olution of Mr.
Hume, to be able to take the part he hath
taken, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed between us.
In the embarra&s;&s;ment I was under, in writing
to General Conway, I could make u&s;e only
of ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions; to which Mr. Hume,
in quality of my friend, gave what inter|pretation
he plea&s;ed. Suppo&s;ing therefore,
for he knew very well to the contrary, that
it was the circum&s;tance of &s;ecrecy which
gave me unea&s;ine&s;s, he obtained the promi&s;e
of the General to endeavour to remove it:
but before any thing was done, it was pre|viou&s;ly
nece&s;&s;ary to know whether I would
accept of the pen&s;ion without that condi|tion,
in order not to expo&s;e his Maje&s;ty to a
&s;econd refu&s;al.</P>
<P>This was the deci&s;ive moment, the end
and object of all his labours. An an&s;wer
was required; he would have it. To pre|vent
effectually indeed my neglect of it, he
&s;ent to Mr. Davenport a duplicate of his
letter to me; and, not content with this
<PB N="75" REF="82">
precaution, wrote me word, in another
billet, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay any
longer in London to &s;erve me. I was giddy
with amazement, on reading this note. Ne|ver
in my life did I meet with any thing &s;o
unaccountable.</P>
<P>At length he obtained from me the &s;o
much de&s;ired an&s;wer, and began pre&s;ently to
triumph. In writing to Mr. Davenport, he
treated me as a mon&s;ter of brutality and in|gratitude.
But he wanted to do &s;till more.
He thinks his mea&s;ures well taken; no
proof can be made to appear again&s;t him.
He demands an explanation; he &s;hall have
it, and here it is.</P>
<P>That la&s;t &s;troke was a ma&s;ter-piece. He
him&s;elf proves every thing, and that beyond
reply.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e, though by way of impo&s;|&s;ibility,
that my complaints again&s;t Mr.
Hume never reached his ears; that he knew
nothing of them; but was as perfectly ig|norant
as if he had held no cabal with tho&s;e
who are acquainted with them, but had re|&s;ided
all the while in China<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How was it po&s;&s;ible for me to gue&s;s at &s;uch chi|merical &s;u&s;picions? Mr. Davenport, the only per&s;on of my acquaintance who then &s;aw Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, a&s;&s;ures me, that he was perfectly ignorant of them him|&s;elf. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet the be|haviour
pa&s;&s;ing directly between us; the
<PB N="76" REF="83">
la&s;t &s;triking words, which I &s;aid to him in
London; the letter which followed replete
with fears and anxiety; my per&s;evering &s;ilence
&s;till more expre&s;&s;ive than words; my public
and bitter complaints with regard to the let|ter
of Mr. d'Alembert; my letter to the Se|cretary
of State, who did not write to me,
in an&s;wer to that which Mr. Hume wrote to
me him&s;elf, and in which I did not mention
him; and in fine my refu&s;al, without deign|ing
to addre&s;s my&s;elf to him, to acquie&s;ce in
an affair which he had managed in my fa|vour,
with my own privity, and without any
oppo&s;ition on my part: all this mu&s;t have
&s;poken in a very forcible manner, I will not
&s;ay to any per&s;on of the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, but
to every man of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Strange that, after I had cea&s;ed to corre&s;|pond
with him for three months, when I
had made no an&s;wer to any one of his letters,
however important the &s;ubject of it, &s;ur|rounded
with both public and private marks
of that affliction which his infidelity gave me;
a man of &s;o enlightened an under&s;tanding,
of &s;o penetrating a genius by nature, and &s;o
dull by de&s;ign, &s;hould &s;ee nothing, hear no|thing,
feel nothing, be moved at nothing;
but, without one word of complaint, ju&s;ti|fication,
or explanation, continue to give me
the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing marks of his good will to
&s;erve me, in &s;pite of my&s;elf! He wrote to
<PB N="77" REF="84">
me affectionately, that he could not &s;tay
any longer in London to do me &s;ervice, as if
we had agreed that he &s;hould &s;tay there for
that purpo&s;e! This blindne&s;s, this in&s;en|&s;ibility,
this per&s;everance, are not in nature;
they mu&s;t be accounted for, therefore, from
other motives. Let us &s;et this behaviour in a
&s;till clearer light; for this is the deci&s;ive point.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have acted in
this affair, either as one of the fir&s;t or la&s;t of
mankind. There is no medium. It remains
to determine which of the two it hath been.</P>
<P>Could Mr. Hume, after &s;o many in&s;tances
of di&s;dain on my part, have &s;till the a&s;toni&s;h|ing
genero&s;ity as to per&s;evere &s;incerely to
&s;erve me? He knew it was impo&s;&s;ible for me
to accept his good offices, &s;o long as I enter|tained
for him &s;uch &s;entiments as I had con|ceived.
He had him&s;elf avoided an expla|nation.
So that to &s;erve me without ju&s;tifying
him&s;elf, would have been to render his &s;er|vices
u&s;ele&s;s; this therefore was no genero|&s;ity.
If he &s;uppo&s;ed that in &s;uch circum&s;tances
I &s;hould have accepted his &s;ervices, he mu&s;t
have &s;uppo&s;ed me to have been an infamous
&s;coundrel. It was then in behalf of a man
whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;coundrel, that
he &s;o warmly &s;olicited a pen&s;ion from his Ma|je&s;ty.
Can any thing be &s;uppo&s;ed more ex|travagant?</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">
But let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Hume,
con&s;tantly pur&s;uing his plan, &s;hould only
have &s;aid to him&s;elf, This is the moment for
its execution; for, by pre&s;&s;ing Rou&s;&s;eau to
accept the pen&s;ion, he will be reduced either
to accept or refu&s;e it. If he accepts it, with
the proofs I have in hand again&s;t him, I &s;hall
be able compleatly to di&s;grace him: if he
refu&s;es, after having accepted it, he will have
no pretext, but mu&s;t give a rea&s;on for &s;uch
refu&s;al. This is what I expect; if he ac|cu&s;es
me he is ruined.</P>
<P>If, I &s;ay, Mr. Hume rea&s;oned with him|&s;elf
in this manner, he did what was con|&s;i&s;tent
with his plan, and in that ca&s;e very
natural; indeed this is the only way in which
his conduct in this affair can be explained,
for upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition it is inexpli|cable:
if this be not demon&s;trable, nothing
ever was &s;o. The critical &s;ituation to which
he had now reduced me, recalled &s;trongly to
my mind the four words I mentioned above;
and which I heard him &s;ay and repeat, at a
time when I did not comprehend their full
force. It was the fir&s;t night after our de|parture
from Paris. We &s;lept in the &s;ame
chamber, when, during the night, I heard
him &s;everal times cry out with great vehe|mence,
in the French language, <HI>Je tiens
J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau.</HI> [I have you, Rou&s;&s;eau.]
<PB N="79" REF="86">
I know not whether he was awake or
a&s;leep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot an&s;wer for every thing I may &s;ay in my &s;leep, and much le&s;s am I con&s;cious whether or not I dream in French. But pray, as Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau did not know whether I was a&s;leep or awake, when I pro|nounced tho&s;e terrible words, with &s;uch a terrible voice, how is he certain that he him&s;elf was well awake when he heard them? <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion was remarkable, coming
from a man who is too well acquainted with
the French language, to be mi&s;taken with
regard to the force or choice of words. I took
tho&s;e words however, and I could not then
take them otherwi&s;e than in a favourable
&s;en&s;e: notwith&s;tanding the tone of voice in
which they were &s;poken, was &s;till le&s;s favour|able
than the expre&s;&s;ion. It is indeed im|po&s;&s;ible
for me to give any idea of it; but it
corre&s;ponds exactly with tho&s;e terrible looks
I have before mentioned. At every repeti|tion
of them I was &s;eized with a &s;huddering,
a kind of horror I could not re&s;i&s;t; though a
moment's recollection re&s;tored me, and made
me &s;mile at my terror. The next day all
this was &s;o perfectly obliterated, that I did
not even once think of it during my &s;tay in
London, and its neighbourhood. It was not
till my arrival in this place, that &s;o many
things have contributed to recall the&s;e words
to mind; and indeed recall them every mo|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87">
The&s;e words, the tone of which dwells on
my heart, as if I had but ju&s;t heard them;
tho&s;e long and fatal looks &s;o frequently ca&s;t
on me; the patting me on the back, with
the repetition of <HI>O, my dear Sir,</HI> in an|&s;wer
to my &s;u&s;picions of his being a trai|tor:
all this affects me to &s;uch a degree,
after what preceded, that this recollection,
had I no other, would be &s;ufficient to pre|vent
any reconciliation or return of confi|dence
between us; not a night indeed pa&s;&s;es
over my head, but I think I hear, <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau,</HI>
<HI>I have you,</HI> ring in my ears as if he had
ju&s;t pronounced them.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Hume, I know you <HI>have me</HI>;
but that only by mere externals: you have
me in the public opinion and judgment of
mankind. You have my reputation, and
perhaps my &s;ecurity, to do with as you will.
The general prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is in your favour;
it will be very ea&s;y for you to make me pa&s;s
for the mon&s;ter you have begun to repre&s;ent
me; and I already &s;ee the barbarous exulta|tion
of my implacable enemies. The public
will no longer &s;pare me. Without any far|ther
examination, every body is on the &s;ide
of tho&s;e who have conferred favours; becau&s;e
each is de&s;irous to attract the &s;ame good
offices, by di&s;playing a &s;en&s;ibility of the obli|gation.
I fore&s;ee readily the con&s;equences
of all this, particularly in the country to
<PB N="81" REF="88">
which you have conducted me; and where,
being without friends and an utter &s;tranger
to every body, I lie almo&s;t entirely at your
mercy. The &s;en&s;ible part of mankind, how|ever,
will comprehend that I mu&s;t be &s;o far
from &s;eeking this affair, that nothing more
di&s;agreeable or terrible could po&s;&s;ibly have
happened to me in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.
They will perceive that nothing but my in|vincible
aver&s;ion to all kind of fal&s;hood, and
the po&s;&s;ibility of my profe&s;&s;ing a regard for a
per&s;on who had forfeited it, could have pre|vented
my di&s;&s;imulation, at a time when it
was on &s;o many accounts my intere&s;t. But
the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind are few, nor do
they make the greate&s;t noi&s;e in the world.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Hume, you <HI>have me</HI> by all the
ties of this life; but you have no power over
my probity or my fortitude, which, being
independent either of you or of mankind, I
will pre&s;erve in &s;pite of you. Think not to
frighten me with the fortune that awaits me.
I know the opinions of mankind; I am ac|cu&s;tomed
to their inju&s;tice, and have learned
to care little about it. If you have taken
your re&s;olution, as I have rea&s;on to believe
you have, be a&s;&s;ured mine is taken al&s;o. I
am feeble indeed in body, but never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
greater &s;trength of mind.</P>
<P>Mankind may &s;ay and do what they will,
it is of little con&s;equence to me. What is of
<PB N="82" REF="89">
con&s;equence, however, is, that I &s;hould end
as I have begun; that I &s;hould continue to
pre&s;erve my ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and integrity to
the end, whatever may happen; and that I
&s;hould have no cau&s;e to reproach my&s;elf
either with meanne&s;s in adver&s;ity, or in&s;o|lence
in pro&s;perity. Whatever di&s;grace at|tends,
or misfortune threatens me, I am
ready to meet them. Though I am to be
pitied, I am much le&s;s &s;o than you, and all
the revenge I &s;hall take on you, is, to leave
you the tormenting con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being
obliged, in &s;pite of your&s;elf, to have a re&s;pect
for the unfortunate per&s;on you have op|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In clo&s;ing this letter, I am &s;urprized at
my having been able to write it. If it were
po&s;&s;ible to die with grief, every line was &s;uf|ficient
to kill me with &s;orrow. Every cir|cum&s;tance
of the affair is equally incompre|hen&s;ible.
Such conduct as yours hath been,
is not in nature: it is contradictory to it&s;elf,
and yet it is demon&s;trable to me that it has
been &s;uch as I conceive. On each &s;ide of me
there is a bottomle&s;s aby&s;s! and I am lo&s;t in
one or the other.</P>
<P>If you are guilty, I am the mo&s;t unfor|tunate
of mankind; if you are innocent, I
am the mo&s;t culpable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And does it depend on an <HI>if,</HI> after all Mr. R's po&s;itive conviction, and ab&s;olute demon&s;trations? <BIBL><HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. You even make
<PB N="83" REF="90">
me de&s;ire to be that contemptible object.
Yes, the &s;ituation to which you &s;ee me re|duced,
pro&s;trate at your feet, crying out for
mercy, and doing every thing to obtain it;
publi&s;hing aloud my own unworthine&s;s, and
paying the mo&s;t explicit homage to your vir|tues,
would be a &s;tate of joy and cordial ef|fu&s;ion,
after the grievous &s;tate of re&s;traint
and mortification into which you have plung|ed
me. I have but a word more to &s;ay. If
you are guilty, write to me no more; it
would be &s;uperfluous, for certainly you could
not deceive me. If you are innocent, ju&s;tify
your&s;elf. I know my duty, I love, and
&s;hall always love it, however difficult and
&s;evere. There is no &s;tate of abjection that a
heart, not formed for it, may not recover
from. Once again, I &s;ay, if you are innocent,
deign to ju&s;tify your&s;elf; if you are not,
adieu for ever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I he&s;itated &s;ome time whether I &s;hould
make any reply to this &s;trange memorial.
At length I determined to write to Mr. Rou&s;|&s;eau
the following letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="84" REF="91">
<HEAD>Mr. HUME to Mr. ROUSSEAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Li&s;le-&s;treet, Leice&s;ter-fields, <DATE>July 22, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL only an&s;wer one article of
your long letter: it is that which regards
the conver&s;ation between us the evening be|fore
your departure. Mr. Davenport had
imagined a good natured artifice, to make you
believe that a retour chai&s;e had offered for
Wooton; and I believe he made an adver|ti&s;ement
be put in the papers, in order the
better to deceive you. His purpo&s;e only was
to &s;ave you &s;ome expences in the journey,
which I thought a laudable project; though
I had no hand either in contriving or con|ducting
it. You entertained, however, &s;u&s;|picions
of his de&s;ign, while we were &s;itting
alone by my fire-side; and you reproached
me with concurring in it. I endeavoured to
pacify you, and to divert the di&s;cour&s;e; but
to no purpo&s;e. You &s;at &s;ullen, and was
either &s;ilent, or made me very peevi&s;h an|&s;wers.
At la&s;t you ro&s;e up, and took a turn
or two about the room; when all of a &s;ud|den,
and to my great &s;urpri&s;e, you clapped
your&s;elf on my knee, threw your arms about
my neck, ki&s;&s;ed me with &s;eeming ardour,
<PB N="85" REF="92">
and bedewed my face with tears. You ex|claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, can you ever
pardon this folly! After all the pains you
have taken to &s;erve me, after the num|berle&s;s
in&s;tances of friend&s;hip you have
given me, here I reward you with this ill
humour and &s;ullenne&s;s. But your for|givene&s;s
of me will be a new in&s;tance of
your friend&s;hip; and I hope you will find
at bottom, that my heart is not unwor|thy
of it."</Q></P>
<P>I was very much affected, I own; and,
I believe, there pa&s;&s;ed a very tender &s;cene
between us. You added, by way of com|pliment,
that though I had many better titles
to recommend me to po&s;terity, yet perhaps
my uncommon attachment and friend&s;hip to
a poor unhappy per&s;ecuted man, would not
altogether be overlooked.</P>
<P>This incident, Sir, was &s;omewhat remark|able;
and it is impo&s;&s;ible that either you or I
could &s;o &s;oon have forgot it. But you have
had the a&s;&s;urance to tell me the &s;tory twice
in a manner &s;o different, or rather &s;o oppo|&s;ite,
that when I per&s;i&s;t, as I do, in this ac|count,
it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that either you
or I are a liar. You imagine, perhaps, that
becau&s;e the incident pa&s;&s;ed privately without
a witne&s;s, the que&s;tion will lie between the
credibility of your a&s;&s;ertion and of mine. But
you &s;hall not have this advantage or di&s;ad|vantage,
<PB N="86" REF="93">
which ever you are plea&s;ed to term
it. I &s;hall produce again&s;t you other proofs,
which will put the matter beyond controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, You are not aware, that I have a
letter under your hand, which is totally irre|concilable
with your account, and confirms
mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of the 22d of March, which is entirely cor|dial; and proves that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau had never, till that moment, entertained, or at lea&s;t di&s;covered, the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion again&s;t me. There is al&s;o in the &s;ame letter, a peevi&s;h pa&s;&s;age about the hire of a chai&s;e.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Secondly, I told the &s;tory the next day, or
the day after, to Mr. Davenport, with a
friendly view of preventing any &s;uch good
natured artifices for the future. He &s;urely
remembers it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As I thought the &s;tory much to
your honour, I told it to &s;everal of my friends
here. I even wrote it to Mde. de Boufflers
at Paris. I believe no one will imagine, that
I was preparing before-hand an apology, in
ca&s;e of a rupture with you; which, of all
human events, I &s;hould then have thought
the mo&s;t incredible, e&s;pecially as we were
&s;eparated almo&s;t for ever, and I &s;till conti|nued
to render you the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The &s;tory, as I tell it, is con|&s;i&s;tent
and rational: there is not common
&s;en&s;e in your account. What! becau&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="94">
&s;ometimes, when ab&s;ent in thought, I have
a fixed look or &s;tare, you &s;u&s;pect me to be a
traitor, and you have the a&s;&s;urance to tell
me of &s;uch black and ridiculous &s;u&s;picions!
Are not mo&s;t &s;tudious men (and many of
them more than I) &s;ubject to &s;uch reveries or
fits of ab&s;ence, without being expo&s;ed to
&s;uch &s;u&s;picions? You do not even pretend
that, before you left London, you had any
other &s;olid grounds of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall enter into no detail with regard to
your letter: the other articles of it are as much
without foundation as you your&s;elf know
this to be. I &s;hall only add, in general, that
I enjoyed about a month ago an uncommon
plea&s;ure, when I reflected, that through
many difficulties, and by mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous care
and pains, I had, beyond my mo&s;t &s;anguine
expectations, provided for your repo&s;e, ho|nour
and fortune. But I &s;oon felt a very
&s;en&s;ible unea&s;ine&s;s when I found that you had
wantonly and voluntarily thrown away all

<P>To all the&s;e papers, I need only &s;ubjoin
the following letter of Mr. Walpole to me,
<PB N="88" REF="95">
which proves how ignorant and innocent I
am of the whole matter of the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia's
letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Mr. WALPOLE to Mr. HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Arlington Street, <DATE>July 26, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT be preci&s;e as to the time of
my writing the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's letter, but
I do a&s;&s;ure you, with the utmo&s;t truth, that
it was &s;everal days before you left Paris, and
before Rou&s;&s;eau's arrival there, of which I
can give you a &s;trong proof; for I not only
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed the letter while you &s;taid there,
out of delicacy to you, but it was the rea&s;on
why, out of delicacy to my&s;elf, I did not go
to &s;ee him, as you often propo&s;ed to me;
thinking it wrong to go and make a cordial
vi&s;it to a man, with a letter in my pocket to
laugh at him. You are at full liberty, dear
Sir, to make u&s;e of what I &s;ay in your ju&s;ti|fication,
either to Rou&s;&s;eau or any body el&s;e.
I &s;hould be very &s;orry to have you blamed
on my account: I have a hearty contempted
of Rou&s;&s;eau, and am perfectly indifferent
what any body thinks of the matter. If
there is any fault, which I am far from
thinking, let it lie on me. No parts can
hinder my laughing at their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if he
<PB N="89" REF="96">
is a mountebank. If he has a bad and mo&s;t
ungrateful heart, as Rou&s;&s;eau has &s;hown in
your ca&s;e, into the bargain, he will have my
&s;corn likewi&s;e, as he will of all good and &s;en|&s;ible
men. You may tru&s;t your &s;entence to
&s;uch, who are as re&s;pectable judges as any that
have pored over ten thou&s;and more volumes.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus I have given a narrative, as conci&s;e
as po&s;&s;ible, of this extraordinary affair, which
I am told has very much attracted the atten|tion
of the public, and which contains more
unexpected incidents than any other in which
I was ever engaged. The per&s;ons to whom
I have &s;hown the original papers which au|thenticate
the whole, have differed very much
in their opinion, as well of the u&s;e I ought
to make of them as of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau's pre|&s;ent
&s;entiments and &s;tate of mind. Some of
them have maintained, that he is altogether
in&s;incere in his quarrel with me, and his
opinion of my guilt, and that the whole pro|ceeds
from that exce&s;&s;ive pride which forms
the ba&s;is of his character, and which leads
him both to &s;eek the eclat of refu&s;ing the
King of England's bounty, and to &s;hake off
the intolerable burthen of an obligation to
me, by every sacrifice of honour, truth, and
friend&s;hip, as well as of intere&s;t. They
<PB N="90" REF="97">
found their &s;entiments on the ab&s;urdity of
that fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition on which he grounds
his anger, viz. that Mr. Walpole's letter,
which he knew had been every where di&s;|per&s;ed
both in Paris and London, was given
to the pre&s;s by me; and as this &s;uppo&s;ition
is contrary to common &s;en&s;e on the one hand,
and not &s;upported even by the pretence of
the &s;lighte&s;t probability on the other, they
conclude, that it never had any weight even
with the per&s;on him&s;elf who lays hold of it.
They confirm their &s;entiments by the number
of fictions and lies, which he employs to ju&s;|tify
his anger; fictions with regard to points,
in which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be mi&s;|taken.
They al&s;o remark his real chearful|ne&s;s
and gaiety, amid&s;t the deep melancholy
with which he pretended to be oppre&s;&s;ed.
Not to mention the ab&s;urd rea&s;oning which
runs through the whole, and on which it is
impo&s;&s;ible for any man to re&s;t his conviction;
and though a very important intere&s;t is here
abandoned, yet money is not univer&s;ally the
chief object with mankind; vanity weighs
farther with &s;ome men, particularly with this
philo&s;opher; and the very oftentation of re|fu&s;ing
a pen&s;ion from the King of England,
an o&s;tentation which, with regard to other
Princes, he has often &s;ought, might be of
it&s;elf a &s;ufficient motive for his pre&s;ent con|duct.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98">
There are others of my friends, who re|gard
this whole affair in a more compa&s;|&s;ionate
light, and con&s;ider Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau as
an object rather of pity than of anger.
They &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame domineering pride
and ingratitude to be the ba&s;is of his cha|racter;
but they are al&s;o willing to believe,
that his brain has received a &s;en&s;ible &s;hock,
and that his judgment, &s;et afloat, is carried to
every &s;ide, as it is pu&s;hed by the current of
his humours and of his pa&s;&s;ions. The ab|&s;urdity
of his belief is no proof of its in|&s;incerity.
He imagines him&s;elf the &s;ole im|portant
being in the univer&s;e: he fancies all
mankind to be in a combination again&s;t him:
his greate&s;t benefactor, as hurting him mo&s;t,
is the chief object of his animo&s;ity: and
though he &s;upports all his whim&s;ies by
lies and fictions, this is &s;o frequent a ca&s;e
with wicked men, who are in that middle
&s;tate between &s;ober rea&s;on and total frenzy,
that it needs give no &s;urprize to any body.</P>
<P>I own that I am much inclined to this lat|ter
opinion; though, at the &s;ame time, I
que&s;tion whether, in any period of his life,
Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau was ever more in his &s;en&s;es
than he is at pre&s;ent. The former brilliancy
of his genius, and his great talents for
writing, are no proof of the contrary. It
is an old remark, that great wits are near
allied to madne&s;s; and even in tho&s;e frantic
<PB N="92" REF="99">
letters which he has wrote to me, there are
evidently &s;trong traces of his wonted genius
and eloquence. He has frequently told me,
that he was compo&s;ing his memoirs, in
which ju&s;tice &s;hould be done to his own
character, to that of his friends, and to that
of his enemies; and as Mr. Davenport in|forms
me that &s;ince his retreat into the coun|try,
he has been much employed in writing,
I have rea&s;on to conclude that he is at pre|&s;ent
fini&s;hing that undertaking. Nothing
could be more unexpected to me than my
pa&s;&s;ing &s;o &s;uddenly from the cla&s;s of his
friends to that of his enemies; but this
tran&s;ition being made, I mu&s;t expect to be
treated accordingly; and I own that this re|flection
gave me &s;ome anxiety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his letter of the 22d of March, he flatters me indirectly with the figure I am to make in his Memoirs; in that of the 23d of June, he threatens me. The&s;e are proofs how much he is in earne&s;t.</NOTE>. A work
of this nature, both from the celebrity of
the per&s;on, and the &s;trokes of eloquence in|ter&s;per&s;ed,
would certainly attract the atten|tion
of the world; and it might be pub|li&s;hed
either after my death, or after that
of the author. In the former ca&s;e, there
would be no body who could tell the &s;tory,
or ju&s;tify my memory. In the latter, my
apology, wrote in oppo&s;ition to a dead per|&s;on,
<PB N="93" REF="100">
would lo&s;e a great deal of its authenti|city.
For this rea&s;on, I have at pre&s;ent col|lected
the whole &s;tory into one Narrative,
that I may &s;how it to my friends, and at any
time have it in my power to make whatever
u&s;e of it they and I &s;hould think proper. I
am, and always have been, &s;uch a lover of
peace, that nothing but nece&s;&s;ity, or very
forcible rea&s;ons, could have obliged me to
give it to the public.</P>

<HEAD>DECLARATION of Mr. D'ALEMBERT,
relating to Mr. Walpole's Letter.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addre&s;&s;ed to the French Editors.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t &s;urprize I learn,
from Mr. Hume, that Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau ac|cu&s;es
me of being the author of the ironical
letter addre&s;&s;ed to him, in the public papers,
under the name of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.
Every body knows, both at Paris and Lon|don,
that &s;uch letter was written by Mr.
Walpole; nor does he di&s;own it. He ac|knowleges
only that he was a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted
in regard to the &s;tile, by a per&s;on he does
not name, and whom perhaps he ought to
name. As to my part, on whom the pub|lic
&s;u&s;picions have fallen in this affair, I am
not at all acquainted with Mr. Walpole:
I don't even believe I ever &s;poke to him;
having only happened to meet once occa|&s;ionally
on a vi&s;it.&mdash;I have not only had not
the lea&s;t to do, either directly or indirectly,
with the letter in que&s;tion, but could mention
above an hundred per&s;ons, among the friends
as well as enemies of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, who
have heard me greatly di&s;approve of it; be|cau&s;e,
as I &s;aid, we ought not to ridicule the
unfortunate, e&s;pecially when they do us no
<PB N="95" REF="102">
harm. Be&s;ides, my re&s;pect for the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, and the acknowledgments I owe
him, might, I &s;hould have thought, have
per&s;uaded Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, that I &s;hould not
have taken &s;uch a liberty with the name of
that prince, even tho' in plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall add, that I never was an
enemy to Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, either open or &s;e|cret,
as he pretends; and I defy him to
produce the lea&s;t proof of my having en|deavoured
to injure him in any &s;hape what|ever.
I can prove to the contrary, by the
mo&s;t re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es, that I have al|ways
endeavoured to oblige him, whenever
it lay in my power.</P>
<P>As to my pretended <HI>&s;ecret corre&s;pondence</HI>
with Mr. Hume, it is very certain, that we
did not begin to write to each other till about
five or &s;ix months after his departure, on
occa&s;ion of the quarrel ari&s;en between him
and Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau, and into which the lat|ter
thought proper unnece&s;&s;arily to intro|duce
me.</P>
<P>I thought this declaration nece&s;&s;ary, for
my own &s;ake, as well as for the &s;ake of
truth, and in regard to the &s;ituation of Mr.
Rou&s;&s;eau: I &s;incerely lament his having &s;o
little confidence in the probity of mankind,
and particularly in that of Mr. Hume.</P>
