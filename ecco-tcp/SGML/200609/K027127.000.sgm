<Q>&mdash;To fear the Lord our God, for our good always.</Q></HEAD>
<P>ONE age is di&s;tingui&s;hed from an|other by no circum&s;tance more remarkably, than by the particu|lar vices which are predominant, and the particular virtues which are unfa|&s;hionable in it. There is no vice which marks the character of the pre&s;ent age more &s;trongly than irreligion. Piety is very ge|nerally di&s;regarded, or allowed to have on|ly a &s;mall degree of worth; the mo&s;t un|affected expre&s;&s;ions of it are &s;tudiou&s;ly a|voided by many, and profe&s;&s;edly ridiculed by &s;ome. Yet the mo&s;t natural &s;entiments of the human heart proclaim, in very intel|ligible language, that piety is the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of the virtues, and has a peculiar prerogative above all the re&s;t. We are ur|ged
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to the practice of &s;ome virtues by our &s;trong &s;en&s;e of their inviolable obligation: we are allured to the love of other virtues by the high approbation of their excellence, which ri&s;es in every well-di&s;po&s;ed mind. But piety is equally inforced by both the&s;e &s;entiments. Its obligation is indi&s;pen&s;able, and its excellence is &s;upreme: it is at once our &s;trict duty, and the greate&s;t glory of hu|man characters. It has thus a witne&s;s of its &s;ingular dignity in the brea&s;t of every man.</P>
<P>IT is not difficult to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of that perver&s;ion of &s;entiment, which has &s;unk piety &s;o far below its genuine rank, in the opinion of the pre&s;ent generation. It is more difficult to find a remedy for this ba&s;e perver&s;ion. It is doubtle&s;s, however, worth while to try every method which is likely to have any force. This generation of men lay claim to a great degree of public &s;pirit, and de&s;ire to be thought deeply concerned for the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety: will it then be unallowable, on this occa&s;ion, to addre&s;s that generous concern for the public good,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
which <HI>all</HI> profe&s;s to entertain, in favour of piety, which <HI>&s;ome</HI> de&s;pi&s;e, and <HI>many</HI> totally neglect? Were a per&s;on to at|tempt erecting piety at once on its ge|nuine foundation, many would think the attempt unworthy of their notice. Were we to in&s;i&s;t on the obligation and proprie|ty of paying &s;ome regard to infinite perfec|tion; were we to repre&s;ent the excellence of a temper which implies the love of good|ne&s;s, and the &s;oundne&s;s of the whole con&s;ti|tution of the &s;oul; were we to di&s;play the refined joys which are in&s;eparable from the exerci&s;e of devout affections, or to &s;peak of the eternal happine&s;s with which God will <HI>reward them that diligently &s;eek him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 6.</NOTE>; our arguments might, perhaps, be addre&s;&s;ed to principles of the human mind which many pretend not to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But when we propo&s;e to &s;how, that true piety has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to promote the public in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, we be&s;peak a principle of action which none would willingly be thought to want; we may rea&s;onably expect
<PB N="6" REF="5">
a favourable hearing from all who have tru|ly public &s;pirit: and if this principle, or any other principle, &s;hould bring men once to regard piety without prejudice, they would &s;oon be captivated with its native charms, and become &s;olicitous to cultivate it in their hearts.</P>
<P>IN the text, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> informs the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that <HI>the Lord commanded them to fear the Lord their God, for their good always,</HI> for their national pro&s;perity. The republic of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was a theocracy, a polity under the immediate protection of Jehovah; who go|verned it by a &s;pecial providence, and was, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, the king of this people. But it was not only on this account that piety was conducive to their national pro&s;pe|rity; it is in its own nature unchangeably conducive to the happine&s;s of every nation. We may exhort every people under heaven <HI>to fear the Lord for their good.</HI></P>
<P>To fear the Lord, is to be truly pious and religious. In the place of religion men &s;ub|&s;titute, &s;ometimes idle &s;uper&s;tition, con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="7" REF="6">
in groundle&s;s terrors, and &s;olicitude about things indifferent; and &s;ometimes bold en|thu&s;ia&s;m, implying unaccountable and un|meaning fervour. But true piety is di&s;tinct from both. It is founded on ju&s;t &s;entiments of the nature and perfections of God, derived both from his works and from his word, and cheri&s;hed and rendered habi|tually pre&s;ent to the mind by frequent medi|tation. It is a temper compounded of reve|rence, love, gratitude, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to|wards the greate&s;t and the be&s;t of beings, prevailing habitually in the &s;oul, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;incere and regular devotion. The Chri&s;tian religion repre&s;ents the character of God as in the highe&s;t degree worthy of all our pious regards, by a&s;&s;uring us that he is <HI>God our &s;aviour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 4.</NOTE>, by informing us of the &s;tupendous di&s;pen&s;ation of grace for the re|demption of the apo&s;tate world, which he has carried on. It therefore requires the&s;e regards, rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t purity and ar|dor, and exerted in the mo&s;t &s;piritual exer|ci&s;es of wor&s;hip, addre&s;&s;ed to God in the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and animated by the influences of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>SUCH is Chri&s;tian piety, which, it is our de&s;ign to prove, has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to promote the public intere&s;ts of civil &s;o|ciety: And after having proved this, we &s;hall &s;how what influence the con&s;ideration of it ought to have on all ranks of men.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> WE &s;hall prove, that piety has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to promote the public intere&s;ts of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE great end of religion, doubtle&s;s, is to fit men for eternity: but it likewi&s;e fits them for all the duties of the pre&s;ent life. The pre&s;ent and the future &s;tate of human beings are two parts of the &s;ame whole. We can be rendered happy in the latter only by being u&s;eful in the former. To employ an appearance of religion as a means of ac|compli&s;hing &s;ecular de&s;igns, is a ba&s;e pro&s;ti|tution of religion: but religion &s;incerely embraced and &s;teadily adhered to for its own &s;ake, will be the mo&s;t powerful in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="9" REF="8">
of promoting every real worldly inter|e&s;t. While it &s;eems to aim directly only at rendering the per&s;on who practi&s;es it virtu|ous and happy, it &s;preads peace and felicity through &s;ociety. The influence of religion on the peace and order of the world is &s;o con&s;picuous, that its enemies have affected to repre&s;ent it as a mere contrivance of poli|ticians for pre&s;erving peace and order. From its acknowledged <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> they have at|tempted to rai&s;e an hypothe&s;is for overturn|ing its <HI>truth.</HI> It has been often proved, that the attempt is vain, and the hypothe&s;is ab&s;ured; but the attempt could not have been made, if the &s;ingular u&s;efulne&s;s of re|ligion in &s;ociety had not been obvious and undeniable.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to doubt, whether a &s;o|ciety could at all &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any con&s;ider|able time, if its members were generally de&s;titute of all religious impre&s;&s;ions. If we examine the &s;tate of the mo&s;t barbarous nations, we &s;hall find, that their peace and order re&s;ult, in a great mea&s;ure, from &s;ome religious &s;entiments, however imperfect,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the want of which could not be &s;upplied by any other principle. Were it po&s;&s;ible to eradicate all &s;en&s;e of religion from the minds of men, &s;carce any thing would be left on which human laws could take hold. When men have any regard to God, the &s;upreme governor of the world, they will <HI>be &s;ubject to the powers that are ordained of God, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con|&s;cience &s;ake</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1. 5.</NOTE>. But when they cea&s;e to re|gard rulers as <HI>the mini&s;ters of God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 4.</NOTE>, there can be no longer any &s;ubjection to their laws for con&s;cience &s;ake; wrath is the only remaining motive to &s;ubjection; and even this motive will be greatly weakened. The &s;evere&s;t &s;anctions can have little influence on tho&s;e who have no &s;en&s;e of God, or of a future &s;tate. How incon&s;iderable is the force of capital puni&s;hments, when men re|gard death as only a tran&s;ient pain, the end of all trouble and calamity? Can a per&s;on have a degree of re&s;olution &s;ufficient to qua|lify him for doing any important &s;ervice to mankind, who would be re&s;trained by the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
fear of death, if he con&s;idered it only in this light? The religion of <HI>Japan</HI> propo&s;es no future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. There de&s;potic government, ever cruel, ever horrid, has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in cruelty. Every law is enacted with unparallelled &s;everity, and executed with &s;hocking barbarity. Yet the laws are de&s;pi&s;ed, and di&s;cover their impotence mo&s;t, when they attempt to ex|ert their greate&s;t force. Without religion, this would be the &s;tate of every nation: nothing could make the laws to be revered but the mo&s;t dreadful tortures. Tortures, which chill us with horror, have been <HI>&s;ome|times</HI> inflicted on <HI>atrocious</HI> criminals. But if religion had not con&s;iderable power even over the generality of mankind, it would be nece&s;&s;ary, and perhaps in&s;ufficient like|wi&s;e, to inflict the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures on <HI>every</HI> criminal. Can any per&s;on be in|&s;en&s;ible, how valuable a ble&s;&s;ing it is to &s;ociety, that mild and moderate puni&s;h|ments are &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve its peace? Need I explain the value of this ble&s;&s;ing to any of the inhabitants of <HI>Britain,</HI> the happy land which has enjoyed it &s;o long? Man|kind
<PB N="12" REF="11">
owe the ble&s;&s;ing only to religion. Is it nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that even a weak &s;en&s;e of religion &s;ecures the general practice of many duties, which could never be &s;uc|ce&s;sfully inforced by human laws? What, except religion, can re&s;train men from &s;ecret crimes? Did not religion &s;upply <HI>and oath for confirmation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 16.</NOTE> of human te&s;timony, how little could te&s;timony often be depended on? And if truth were not regarded as &s;acred, in how many in&s;tances would life, and property, and reputation, be preca|rious?</P>
<P>RELIGION has been often deba&s;ed by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruptions, which have very much weakened its influence on mankind. But the greate&s;t corruptions of religion could never totally de&s;troy its power. A little truth, though almo&s;t &s;tifled by the ab&s;urde&s;t tenets, and the vile&s;t &s;uper&s;titions, with which it was loaded, has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;played the power of religion to render men good members of &s;ociety.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Some depravations of religion have a very pernicious tendency. Innumerable mi&s;|chiefs have ari&s;en from them. But could we find, in any age, or in any region of the world, an example of a community de&s;titute of all religion, we &s;hould &s;oon be convinced, that the mi&s;chiefs of <HI>irreligion</HI> are incomparably greater, and more de|&s;tructive to &s;ociety, than all the bad effects which can be charged on <HI>fal&s;e</HI> religion. We have frequent opportunity to ob&s;erve the operation of &s;uper&s;tition in multitudes. This excites our zeal again&s;t it, a zeal hone&s;t and laudable in it&s;elf. But being apt, like every other principle, to become exce&s;&s;ive or irregular, it makes us often regard with too much indulgence, the far greater hor|rors of irreligion; which never prevails uni|ver&s;ally; and which acts, for the mo&s;t part, in di&s;gui&s;e, and with re&s;erve, even among the few who give up them&s;elves to its ab&s;olute &s;way. A long catalogue of the ill con&s;equences of fal&s;e religion may doubt|le&s;s be produced; but could we &s;et in op|po&s;ition to it a complete enumeration of the benefits which &s;ociety has actually derived
<PB N="14" REF="13">
from very corrupt religions, we &s;hould find them more numerous and important than tho&s;e which it derives from any other &s;ource.</P>
<P>RELIGION is exhibited in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us, perfectly pure, &s;eparated from all corruptions and foreign mixtures. But its purity is deba&s;ed by the imperfections which cleave to its profe&s;&s;ors in the pre&s;ent &s;tate; and it is but &s;lightly embraced, and incom|pletely practi&s;ed by them. On this account the Chri&s;tian religion does not re&s;train and govern men &s;o much as might be ju&s;tly expected. It has really, notwith&s;tanding, much greater influence on the generality, than is commonly imagined. We are ac|cu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve things going on in a certain cour&s;e. By this means they become &s;o familiar to us, that we never inquire from what cau&s;es they proceed. We &s;ee men &s;ubmitting in&s;en&s;ibly to many re&s;traints, without which they could not live together in &s;ociety. We &s;eldom inquire, whence the&s;e re&s;traints ari&s;e. But if they were tra|ced to their origin, it would appear that
<PB N="15" REF="14">
very many of them ari&s;e from religion.&mdash;We are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to fix a certain &s;tandard of every virtue that enters into a character, and to con&s;ider per&s;ons who fall much below this &s;tandard as wholly de&s;ti|tute of the virtue. We con&s;ider tho&s;e alone as intitled to the character of piety, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater regard to religion than the generality of mankind. We overlook the lower degrees of this regard, which are to be found in every brea&s;t. But many who have not a degree of piety &s;ufficient for the eternal &s;alvation of their own &s;ouls, have yet &s;ome regard to the re&s;traints of religion, by which their behaviour in &s;ociety is in|fluenced. All men have &s;ome imperfect &s;en&s;e of religion, which renders them much fitter for the duties of &s;ociety than they could be without it. A &s;en&s;e of religion, as it were, grows up with the human mind, and is, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, incor|porated with it in its very growth. It mixes with our &s;everal operations unperceived, and often actuates our conduct, when we are in&s;en&s;ible of its force. It e&s;tabli&s;hes an habitual turn of mind, which, without our
<PB N="16" REF="15">
reflecting on it, re&s;trains us from many crimes hurtful to &s;ociety, and predi&s;po&s;es us for &s;ubmitting to tho&s;e laws by which the happine&s;s of the community is &s;ecured. Civil laws control only our external ac|tions; but the laws of religion kill the &s;eeds of tho&s;e principles, which, when they are cheri&s;hed, &s;pring up &s;lowly and gradually into crimes. Civil laws regulate only that one &s;pecies of conduct with re&s;pect to which they are profe&s;&s;edly enacted; but the laws of religion extend their influence to all our principles of action at once.</P>
<P>IF religion has in its very nature &s;o great a tendency to &s;trengthen all the ties of civil government, and if &s;ociety does actually de|rive &s;o great advantages from very corrupt religions, or from the imperfect regard to religion which even the generality of man|kind have; what happine&s;s would not ari&s;e from the univer&s;al prevalence of that exalted piety which Chri&s;tianity requires? Were this true, unadulterated religion, heartily em|braced, perfectly complied with, uniform|ly acted upon, it would render &s;ociety hap|pier
<PB N="17" REF="16">
than we can ea&s;ily imagine. Suppo&s;e the hearts of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e pious regards which are due to infinite perfec|tion; &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e regards animated by a lively &s;en&s;e of the manifold di&s;plays of infi|nite perfection in the &s;y&s;tem of nature; &s;up|po&s;e them refined and elevated by a vigo|rous and habitual conception of our Sa|viour's &s;tupendous and gracious undertaking for the &s;alvation of mankind; &s;uppo&s;e them rai&s;ed to all that &s;trength and firmne&s;s to which they may be rai&s;ed by the infl&ugrave;ences of the &s;pirit of grace, earne&s;tly implored and carefully improved; &s;uppo&s;e them conti|nually cheri&s;hed by the exerci&s;e of &s;incere devotion; &s;uppo&s;e them to rule within, and to produce that character which they natu|rally tend to produce; would not the tem|per which they form, imply ingenuous reve|rence and fear of <HI>the Mo&s;t High,</HI> more effec|tual to govern the conduct, than the &s;lavi&s;h dread of any earthly ruler? Would not this temper imply nobler ambition than any that can ari&s;e from political di&s;tinctions, ambi|tion to plea&s;e and to re&s;emble God? Would not this temper lead to purer and more &s;o|lid
<PB N="18" REF="17">
virtue, than can re&s;ult from or be &s;up|ported by the be&s;t-con&s;tituted form of go|vernment? How powerful would civil laws become, were their influence &s;trength|ened in every heart, by a &s;teady regard to the laws, and to the judgment of the ruler of the world? Would not civil laws, in|deed, be almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary? A temper of true Chri&s;tian piety would re&s;train men ef|fectually from every degree of all tho&s;e crimes which di&s;turb the peace, or ob&s;truct the pro&s;perity of a nation. If it were uni|ver&s;ally diffu&s;ed, only nece&s;&s;ary laws would be enacted, and every law would be chear|fully and con&s;tantly obeyed. Every indivi|dual would be &s;olicitous to act his part in &s;ociety in the be&s;t manner; the wi&s;dom of all would be united in contriving, and the endeavours of all would be combined in executing every mea&s;ure of public utility; all tho&s;e virtues which contribute mo&s;t to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, cheri&s;hed by piety, would flouri&s;h in ab&s;olute maturity. Accu|&s;tomed as we are to the pre&s;ent degeneracy of the human race, it is not ea&s;y to &s;tretch our imaginations &s;o far, as to form an idea
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of the pro&s;perity of a nation, in which <HI>the people</HI> were <HI>all righteous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;. lx. 21.</NOTE>, in which virtue directed and added force to the united power of the whole community; which, &s;ecure from every internal evil, were regarded with awe and reverence by nations more corrupted, and con&s;equently weaker. But were Chri&s;tian piety univer&s;ally practi&s;ed in any nation, that nation would experience in its infallible con&s;equences, this high pro&s;pe|rity, which is, at pre&s;ent, even inconceive|able: and the favour of God, who <HI>loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hateth iniquity</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xi. 7. v. 5.</NOTE>, would be&s;tow higher pro&s;perity on that nation, than all which could re&s;ult from the natu|ral con&s;equences of their own piety.</P>
<P>I HOPE it is evident from what has been &s;aid, that piety contributes greatly to the public happine&s;s of every nation. Let us <HI>next</HI> &s;how briefly, what influence the con&s;i|deration of this ought to have on all ranks of men.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
IN every nation there are many of &s;upe|rior and di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. The higher the rank which per&s;ons hold, the greater will be the importance, the more exten&s;ive the influence of their behaviour in &s;ociety. Any neglect of duty in them is more per|nicious to their country, than a &s;imilar neg|lect in per&s;ons of inferior rank. Since reli|gion, therefore, mo&s;t effectually regulates the conduct of every citizen, how nece&s;&s;ary is it to the happine&s;s of a nation, that the great be entirely &s;ubject to the influence of religion? Your country calls upon you, ye great, ye noble, for her &s;ake; &s;he be&s;eeches you, for the happine&s;s which <HI>your</HI> right be|haviour e&s;pecially will confer on her, to ex|cel in piety, that it may, like a living &s;pirit, animate you continually in <HI>&s;eeking her good</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxii. 9.</NOTE>.&mdash;Your piety will tend to make others, as well as your&s;elves, good citizens. They who have been lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to regard reli|gion them&s;elves, have neverthele&s;s acknow|ledged the nece&s;&s;ity of cheri&s;hing religious impre&s;&s;ions in the generality. The exam|ple
<PB N="21" REF="20">
of the higher ranks will cheri&s;h them mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully. Should their practice &s;hew that they regard religion with indiffer|ence, mankind, always eager to imitate their &s;uperiors, will &s;oon endeavour to free them&s;elves from the re&s;traints which reli|gion lays upon their vices. Piety con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in an inward temper. It is a fal&s;e appearance of it that &s;tudiou&s;ly di&s;plays it|&s;elf in external &s;how. But inward piety is naturally expre&s;&s;ed in unaffected devotion, and regular wor&s;hip of God. It is only by being thus expre&s;&s;ed, that it becomes ob|vious to others, or can attract their imita|tion. If we would render others pious by our good example, we mu&s;t put forth piety into act on every proper occa&s;ion. But the example of piety will be mo&s;t attractive, when it is exhibited by tho&s;e whom Divine Providence has placed in an eminent rank. In their conduct piety will &s;hine with the greate&s;t lu&s;tre. When they render their re|gard to God con&s;picuous and unque&s;tionable, the re&s;t of mankind will be in&s;en&s;ibly allu|red to the practice of religion. It is the privilege of tho&s;e who are exalted above the
<PB N="22" REF="21">
many, that they have it in their power to re|commend every virtue to mankind, by their example; a noble privilege, which they are &s;trictly obliged to exerci&s;e. And can the obligation be &s;tronger with regard to any virtue, than with regard to piety, which is mo&s;t excellent in it&s;elf, and mo&s;t beneficial to human &s;ociety?</P>
<P>AGAIN, becau&s;e piety has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to promote the happine&s;s of every people, it is particularly incumbent on all who are intru&s;ted with any degree of autho|rity and power, on all governors, judges, and magi&s;trates, to exerci&s;e and to encou|rage unfeigned and exalted piety. Many of the rulers of every kingdom are naturally of &s;uperior rank, and all of them derive im|portance from their public character. This will give force and influence to their exam|ple.&mdash;Rulers are the proper guardians of the peace and order of &s;ociety. It is chiefly religion that &s;upports tho&s;e connections of individuals, which be&s;tow order on &s;ociety, which di&s;tingui&s;h a regular polity from a confu&s;ed multitude, and which produce
<PB N="23" REF="22">
public peace, pro&s;perity, and power. On this account, all rulers are, by their office, in a peculiar manner, the guardians of reli|gion. They cannot exert them&s;elves in this character, if they be either indifferent about religion, or aver&s;e from it. Without a warm regard to religion prevailing in their own hearts, they will not employ their authority in promoting it. If, therefore, any ruler neglect the duties, or tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of piety, he unworthily betrays the highe&s;t intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, with the pro|tection of which he is intru&s;ted. His prac|tice tends, indirectly perhaps, but certainly, to multiply tho&s;e crimes which it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to correct; it tends to introduce tho&s;e di&s;orders into &s;ociety which his office is in&s;tituted on purpo&s;e to prevent.&mdash;It is of the highe&s;t moment to &s;ociety, that the public functions of rulers be well executed. Rulers are le&s;s &s;ubject than others to the re&s;traints which ari&s;e from human laws. They can execute the laws again&s;t others; but them&s;elves have many advantages for eluding the force of the laws, from their rank, their authority, and power. The laws
<PB N="24" REF="23">
of religion alone, regarded and complied with, can &s;ufficiently control their actions. In tho&s;e mon&s;trous governments them|&s;elves, where the power of rulers is ab&s;o|lute, the laws even of fal&s;e and corrupt re|ligions lay &s;ome re&s;traint on the will of the rulers, and induce them to act, in many in&s;tances, with moderation. What happi|ne&s;s, then, might not be derived to man|kind from their governors, if, in better con&s;titutions of government, a purer reli|gion united its re&s;traints with tho&s;e under which the civil laws lay the highe&s;t rulers?&mdash;Power is apt to be abu&s;ed, and to pro|duce in&s;olence and &s;everity. The benign &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian piety, thoroughly imbibed by rulers, is the mo&s;t effectual pre&s;ervative from the abu&s;e of power. Religion will beget in the mighty ones of the earth a &s;en&s;e of dependence on <HI>the Mo&s;t High,</HI> who&s;e children and &s;ubjects all men are; and this &s;en&s;e will be a powerful principle of ju&s;tice, gentlene&s;s, and clemency to all whom God hath &s;ubjected to their power. Religion will lead them to con&s;ider their power as derived from the gracious and

righteous governor of the world; and to exerci&s;e it uniformly for the good of all, ac|cording to the example of righteou&s;ne&s;s and benignity which God exhibits in his provi|dence towards his creatures. The univer|&s;al prevalence of Chri&s;tian piety would have force enough to bani&s;h from the earth the cruel &s;lavery under which a great part of mankind groan at pre&s;ent. In fact, where|ever Chri&s;tianity has been embraced, it has prevented many of the horrors of lawle&s;s de&s;poti&s;m, and introduced &s;ome degree of moderation into the &s;pirit of government. Governors, animated by its genuine power, will ever be <HI>the mini&s;ters of God to men for good</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii 4.</NOTE>. <HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye kings: be in&s;tructed, ye judges of the earth: &s;erve the Lord with fear</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ii. 10. 11.</NOTE>. <HI>Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and &s;trength.

<P>FURTHER, the con&s;ideration of that in|fluence
<PB N="26" REF="25">
which piety has upon the public happine&s;s, ought to add &s;trength to the en|deavours of all the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us, for cheri&s;hing the benign and heavenly &s;pirit of religion in the hearts of men. We are bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, we are urged by all po&s;&s;ible con&s;iderations, to promote univer&s;al and &s;incere regard to God, who&s;e mini&s;ters, for this very end, we are. Should our country find any of <HI>us</HI> defective in piety, that virtue which is rendered peculiarly incumbent upon us by the relation in which we &s;tand to the all-perfect object of it; &s;hould our country have rea&s;on to impute any of the mi&s;chiefs which &s;he cannot fail to &s;uffer from the impiety of her &s;ons, to our indifference about religion; O let us think, what indignation may &s;he not ju&s;tly pour out on us, as the mo&s;t undutiful and abandoned of her children; as wretches, who cannot be re&s;trained by con&s;iderations, mo&s;t &s;acred to all, but to us more &s;acred than to any others, from being traitors to her mo&s;t important intere&s;ts! True piety is to every nation, like the &s;un to this
<PB N="27" REF="26">
earth; it alone can enlighten, warm, che|ri&s;h, or invigorate all its inhabitants. But in the pre&s;ent age, the influences of this glorious luminary are often ob&s;tructed, often infected. The impious, as if they dwelt in &s;ome frozen clime, feel none of its force; the dark clouds of &s;uper&s;tition intercept its rays from others; enthu&s;ia&s;m, like a fla&s;h|ing meteor, confounds its light, and con|verts its genial warmth into unnatural, &s;ul|try, and &s;uffocating heat. To the mini&s;ters of religion is committed the important office of conducting all, as it were, into a happy region, and placing them in a favourable &s;ituation, where the beams of religion, un|ob&s;tructed, pure, and inten&s;e, may pene|trate their hearts. Would we promote the happine&s;s of men, either in this world or in the next, let us do our utmo&s;t to lay their &s;ouls open to the influences of piety, and to prepare them for receiving them. Be it our con&s;tant care to pre&s;ent to the view of our hearers true piety, and &s;erious devotion, in its genuine form, neither tainted by en|thu&s;ia&s;m, nor deba&s;ed by &s;uper&s;tition; let us labour to expre&s;s the &s;ecret operation of
<PB N="28" REF="27">
devout affections in the heart; let us di&s;|play their beauty and their power, in all the exerci&s;es of fervent devotion; let us dwell often on the view of divine excel|lence, e&s;pecially as it is manife&s;ted in the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, that men may feel what regards are due to it, that they may perceive the ba&s;e degeneracy of that &s;oul which cannot be affected by it; let us endeavour to excite their love to godline&s;s, by repre&s;enting, as far as words can repre|&s;ent, the charms of a temper of devotion, its refined and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures, and its happy con&s;equences; let us u&s;e all the means we can, to form men to the ta&s;te, and to win them to the pur&s;uit of that real dignity of character, which piety alone can be&s;tow; let piety e&s;pecially &s;hine forth pure, fervent, and exalted in our own example. By aiming continually at all this, we &s;hall be&s;t perform our duty, not only to God, and to our own &s;ouls, but al&s;o to our coun|try. If our endeavours prove &s;ucce&s;sful, by our means <HI>peace</HI> &s;hall <HI>be within her walls, and pro&s;perity within her palaces</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxii. 7.</NOTE>: for the

<P>FINALLY, let us all, whatever be our rank or &s;tation, <HI>fear the Lord always, for our good.</HI> The enemies of religion impu|dently boa&s;t, that their enlarged views have enabled them to provide for the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> hap|pine&s;s of the world, by &s;etting men free from the unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions of a God and a future &s;tate. But it may be affirmed with greater truth, that by checking all regard to that great being who alone can be&s;tow <HI>eter|nal</HI> happine&s;s, they, at the &s;ame time, with &s;urpri&s;ing narrowne&s;s of thought, de&s;troy the only foundation of <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> peace and happine&s;s, both to individuals and to &s;ocie|ties. Let us, my Chri&s;tian brethren, ever regard their attempts with indignation. In &s;pight of all the &s;ophi&s;try, and all the ridi|cule, by which they would de&s;troy a firm

We are all members of &s;ociety; we are all obliged to promote its peace and happine&s;s; an argument drawn from its in|tere&s;t ought to be irre&s;i&s;tible to us all: let us, therefore, practi&s;e piety, which is the principal bond of &s;ocial union. We are ob|liged to piety, not only as we are men and Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o as we are citizens; it is a duty which each of us owes to his coun|try.

None of us is &s;o ob&s;cure, as to be wholly incapable of promoting religion by an example of regard to it. Princes may recommend religion powerfully by their authority and example:
