<HEAD>THE
DANGER
OF
Court Differences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_STATE Polity,</HI> is the
<HI>Devil</HI>'s Divinity, &s;aid
good old Bi&s;hop <HI>La|timer</HI>
the Martyr,
when &s;ome of the
Moderators in Refor|mation
were for Tem|pori&s;ing
between <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant
Religion,</HI> and for not making
a thorough Turn, for fear of the high
Popi&s;h Party among the People.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
The Ca&s;e was this, and the Hi&s;to|ry
of it may be for our Edification.</P>
<P>The King being &s;ettled in the
Throne, and having declar'd Him&s;elf
a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and that as He was
the fir&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> King that ever
wore the Crown, &s;o He re&s;olv'd to
make the fir&s;t avow'd effectual Step
to a Reformation. The good Bi&s;hops,
the godly and zealous Mini&s;ters, and
the religious People of all Kinds, who
had been Sufferers in the late Reign,
and under the Tyranny of his Fa|ther;
the&s;e, I &s;ay, began to lift up
their Heads, own'd the King warm|ly,
and encourag'd Him exceedingly
in the ble&s;&s;ed Work of Pulling up
Popery and Tyranny by the Roots;
and Planting the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion
and Liberty in the Room of it.</P>
<P>BY THE WAY, you are de&s;ired
to NOTE, <HI>that Popery and Tyranny
went then always together,</HI> tho' Ty|ranny
has got another Companion
&s;ince, call'd <HI>High Church</HI>; with the
Reformation came in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
that is to &s;ay, the Perfection of it;
and as that Reformation went on far|ther
and farther, Liberty grew in its
Stature and Strength, till it arriv'd to
where it is now. But of this, on a|nother
Occa&s;ion I may &s;ay more.</P>
<P>When the Reformation, I &s;ay, was
thus attempted, the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Clergy,
the <HI>High Church of that Day,</HI> rai&s;ed
a hideous Out-Cry, that <HI>the Church
was in Danger</HI>; and not only &s;o, but
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the ignorant People all over
the Kingdom with &s;uch blind Zeal,
and ridiculous Notions, as well of the
King, as of the Reformation, that it
fir&s;t &s;pread in a general Di&s;affection,
and afterwards broke out into a mo&s;t
dangerous Rebellion, in &s;everal Parts
of the Kingdom, particularly in the
We&s;t; where the City of <HI>Exeter</HI> was
clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by 20000 Rebels;
and at <HI>Norwich,</HI> where <HI>KET,</HI> a Tan|ner,
at the Head of 30000 Men, took
the City twice, and did a great deal
of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Rebellions were, by
the Zeal and Loyalty of the Prote|&s;tant
<PB N="6" REF="5">
(<HI>Whig</HI>) Party, and by the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of &s;ome Foreign Troops, (<HI>Ger|mans</HI>)
reduced, and the Rebels had
received the Reward of their Trea|&s;on,
&s;ome in the Field, and &s;ome af|terwards
at the Gallows, it was not
doubted but then, the King being
e&s;tabli&s;hed, and his Enemies &s;ubdued,
the Work of Reformation might go
on without interruption, and that its
Enemies would receive all po&s;&s;ible
Di&s;couragement at Court; the rather,
becau&s;e it was known, that the true
Settlement of God's Church, and of
the true Religion, was the King's
fix'd De&s;ign; That as He had Zeal
&s;ufficient to &s;uffer any thing rather
than to give over his ju&s;t Underta|king,
&s;o He had Courage, even beyond
him&s;elf, both to &s;tand by his Friends,
and to do Ju&s;tice to his Enemies, and
to fear no Man.</P>
<P>But in the middle of this happy
Scituation of Things, a cur&s;ed Spirit
of Trimming, call'd at that Time <HI>State
Policy,</HI> thru&s;t it &s;elf in among the
great Men at Court; and had not
the Courage, Steddine&s;s, and Re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of the King, tho' not at that
Time fully acquainted with the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Government, interpo&s;ed, the Re|formation
had been ruin'd, and cru&s;h'd
in its Birth; all the Blood and Trea|&s;ure
&s;pent, all the long &s;truggle of
the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Party in the preceed|ing
Reign, and all the Expectations
the World had entertained of a hap|py
E&s;tabli&s;hment in this Nation, had
been lo&s;t and de&s;troyed; indeed, not|with&s;tanding
all the King could do,
and even in &s;pight of his Re&s;olution
to the contrary, it did make great
Impre&s;&s;ions upon his Affairs, and great
Havock among his Friends; brought
his Friends to fall out and quarrel
with one another, and obliged the
milde&s;t and mo&s;t merciful King on
Earth to &s;ign the Execution of his
neare&s;t Friends; and now, as one
<HI>Party,</HI> then another, got uppermo&s;t
in the Admini&s;tration, the poor af|flicted
<HI>Prince</HI> was oblig'd to act now
this Way, then that Way, contrary
even to his own Inclination, and
&s;ometimes almo&s;t contrary to his
Principle.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
We, who are the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e
<HI>Reformers,</HI> and who now enjoy our
Liberty and Religion, as the Con&s;e|quence
of that excellent Prince's Zeal
and Sincerity in <HI>Religion,</HI> have rea&s;on
to be thankful that He &s;tood his
Ground in religious Matters; and had
He with the &s;ame &s;teddine&s;s and Cou|rage
governed his turbulent, merce|nary,
and ever-cla&s;hing, di&s;agreeing
Courtiers, we had, perhaps, enjoy'd
many Ages ago an Inheritance of Li|berties
which the World are not yet
acquainted with; for 'tis evident, that
the Pride, the Ambition, the Avarice
and Envy which reign'd among the
Mini&s;ters of that Reign, &s;o effectual|ly
di&s;concerted their Mea&s;ures, and
divided their Intere&s;ts, that they could
not &s;upport the Settlement of the
Succe&s;&s;ion beyond the Life of that
King, but fell fir&s;t off from one ano|ther,
and then fell all in with <HI>Mary,</HI>
the Daughter of King <HI>Henry,</HI> who
was declared Illegitimate, was &s;et a|&s;ide
by the E&s;tabli&s;hment, and was
no better at that Time than a Po|pi&s;h
Pretender; and had not a more
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Ma&s;culine Spirit govern'd them in
the next Reign after, tho' in the Per|&s;on
of a Woman, we had, as the Ef|fect
of tho&s;e Court Divi&s;ions, been all
at this time Papi&s;ts and Slaves, Ido|laters
in our religious Conduct, and
mean dejected Scoundrels in our civil
Conduct, and &s;uch would our Po&s;te|rity
have been al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Secret Hi&s;tory of this Devi|li&s;h
Court Snare, I mean as to the
religious Part, and as well what Dan|ger
it put the Reformation in, as
al&s;o how it was qua&s;h'd with one
noble &s;teddy Word of that re&s;olute and
pious Prince, mu&s;t needs be very di|verting
and profitable to all that read
it, e&s;pecially at a time, when the E|nemies
of the &s;ame Reformation are
trying the &s;ame Helli&s;h Practices up|on
the very &s;ame Nation.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Story is this: The
King being young in the Govern|ment,
at his fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to the
Crown, was however very happily
&s;urrounded with grave and wi&s;e Coun|&s;ellers,
in who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Fideli|ty,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Vigilance and Courage, the Na|tion
had a full &s;atisfaction: They
fought his Battles abroad with Gal|lantry,
and with Succe&s;s; they go|verned
his Affairs at Home with ex|traordinary
Sagacity, Judgment, Pru|dence,
and Ju&s;tice: The very Name
of the King began to be terrible to
Popery; The Mobbs and Tumults
abated, as well as the Rebellious were
qua&s;h'd, and which was &s;till better
than all, the general Di&s;affection of
the People began to wear off, and
the publick Affairs &s;eemed to run with
a full Channel into Peace and Set|tlement,
when two unhappy things,
which on a &s;udden broke out among
the Courtiers and Mini&s;ters of State,
had like to have overthrown Peace,
Settlement, Religion, nay, King and
all.</P>
<P>The&s;e were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Trimming, and Temporizing in
the Reformation. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Divi&s;ion and Faction among the
Courtiers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
I'll be very brief in the Account
I &s;hall give of the&s;e Two unhappy
things, and yet I de&s;ire &s;o to ex|plain
the Circum&s;tances, and &s;o faith|fully
to relate the Conduct of the
Per&s;ons, that the Warning it may be
to future Ages may be flagrant, and
the Moral or Improvement may revive
with the Story.</P>
<P>The Rebellious ju&s;t now mention'd,
had been in behalf of, or rather on
the Pretence of Zeal for the Church,
and it had been indeed a mo&s;t dan|gerous
Cri&s;is to have &s;uch bold and
de&s;perate attempts made in the In|fancy
of the King's Affairs.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>States Men,</HI> who were
in the Main real Friends to the <HI>Re|formation,</HI>
and very faithful to the
King and his Intere&s;t, yet intimida|ted
a little by the Dangers they had
been in, and by the Daily In&s;olence
and Threats of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Party,
who were &s;till very numerous in the
Country, &s;tarted very unhappily, and
in an ill Hour, this wretched Opini|on
<PB N="12" REF="11">
or Notion, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was
too bold an attempt for the King,
to undertake to make a thorough
<HI>Reformation</HI> at once upon the Peo|ple;
that it would exa&s;perate the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Party, and as they had power|ful
Alliances abroad, and formidable
Numbers at Home, they would not
only be always Plotting again&s;t the
publick Peace, but that it was too
probable they might &s;ome time or
other get the Start of them, and
ruine them all; and that therefore it
were but good <HI>State Policy</HI> to tem|porize
a little, to go on by Degrees,
and to act with <HI>Popery,</HI> as &s;ome of
the good Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> did with
Idolatry, of whom it was &s;aid, <HI>They
did that which was right in the Sight of the
Lord. Neverthele&s;s the high Places were
not taken away, but the People burnt In|cen&s;e
yet in the high Places,</HI> 2 Chron.
XX. 33.</P>
<P>In like manner, they were for let|ting
the <HI>Reformation</HI> go on gradual|ly,
leaving &s;uch of the <HI>Reliques</HI> of
<HI>Popery</HI> as were of le&s;s Con&s;equence
for a while unreformed, admitting a
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Mixture of Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants
into their Councils and Admini&s;tra|tion,
that the former might be there|by
be engaged by the Court Ser|vices,
and Preferments, to embark no
more with, or encourage the People
in their Di&s;affection; Nor did it end
in this Propo&s;al of a <HI>motley Mini&s;try,</HI>
but even a <HI>motley Reformation</HI> was
to be the Con&s;equence, and the High
Church were to be &s;o blended with
the low, that is to &s;ay, Papi&s;t with
Prote&s;tant, and &s;o much of the <HI>Re|liques</HI>
of Popery were to have been
left in the new E&s;tabli&s;hment of Re|ligion,
that as a famous States Man
of that Day, who had more Since|rity
than all of them, &s;aid, meaning
the Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> They would &s;et
up a Religion that was neither Pa|pi&s;t
nor Prote&s;tant, that God would
not own, nor them&s;elves under|&s;tand.</P>
<P>When
this Project was laid before
the King, He cau&s;ed the Arch-Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to read it over to Him.
But it di&s;gu&s;ted Him extremely; and
when the other Bi&s;hops began to
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;peak in Favour of it, the King, who
had more Courage and Hone&s;ty than
all of them, an&s;wered in that memo|rable
Expre&s;&s;ion of Scripture, <HI>Cur&s;ed
be he that doth the Work of the Lord
deceitfully</HI>: And when another Bi|&s;hop
asked a little tartly, <HI>What then
mu&s;t be done? Shall we be always
fighting about difficult Que&s;tions?</HI> The
King &s;till &s;tanding &s;teady to his Prin|ciples,
and &s;hewing an abhorrence of
the Cowardice and Treachery of his
Courtiers, ri&s;ing up in &s;ome Heat,
replied in the Words of our Saviour,
<HI>Every Plant which my Heavenly Fa|ther
has not Planted &s;hall be rooted
up</HI>; and no Man dur&s;t move any
thing of that Kind to Him ever after.</P>
<P>This Zeal and Courage of the King
e&s;tabli&s;hed the Reformation.</P>
<P>This Trimming and Treachery,
would have &s;ent them all back to
Popery.</P>
<P>Leaving this Hi&s;tory to be clo&s;e|ly
applied, as Occa&s;ion &s;hall offer, I
proceed to the &s;econd Thing which
<PB N="15" REF="14">
ruined the Peace of that ble&s;&s;ed King's
Reign, and which, as I have &s;aid,
let in a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Pretender upon
them in the next, and this was,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Divi&s;ions at Court.</HI> Emulation,
Ambition, Avarice, and Envy, po&s;|&s;e&s;t
the Minds of his Courtiers, and
the Con&s;equences were the&s;e.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They ruined and de&s;troyed
one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They brought in the half re|formed
Courtiers that them|&s;elves
had &s;pued out, letting
in their Enemies to &s;upport
their Factions one again&s;t a|nother.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Tho&s;e very Enemies, who
came in by the&s;e Divi&s;ions,
brought in a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Pretender
upon them in the next <HI>Reign,</HI>
and brought them all to Fire
and Faggot.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If this were a Parable or Allego|ry
only, by which to repre&s;ent to our
<PB N="16" REF="15">
pre&s;ent People, the Dangers which
might po&s;&s;ibly happen upon taking
in their Enemies, to fortifie and form
Intere&s;ts again&s;t their Friends, and to
&s;upport their &s;everal Parties one a|gain&s;t
another, it might have been
thrown by and di&s;regarded as the
Chimera of a &s;cribbling Head, which
had in it no more than &s;uch People
generally produce.</P>
<P>But as it is a real Hi&s;tory, the
Matters of Fact upon Record, and
the Truth of them not to be di&s;|puted;
as the Tragical Part which
follow'd was acted upon the Stage
of our own Country, and the Fire
and Faggot of their Popi&s;h Per&s;ecu|tions
&s;moaked in our own Streets,
as it was not long ago, and the
Ruine of tho&s;e who &s;uffered under it
is felt in our Families even to this
Day, it comes with the greater E|nergy
upon us, the Force of it is
not to be re&s;i&s;ted, nor can the Cau|tion
given from it be called unju&s;t or
improper.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
Like Cau&s;es produce like Con&s;e|quences
in all Ages, or at lea&s;t, may
do &s;o; it may not therefore be im|proper
to look briefly over the Court
Divi&s;ions of that <HI>Reign,</HI> and &s;ee how
they began, how they were carried
on, and how it came to pa&s;s that
the be&s;t and only E&s;tabli&s;hment of
tho&s;e Times for a Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;ion,
was overthrown and de&s;troyed,
meerly and only by the Contention
and Divi&s;ions of the great Men at
Court; and in doing this, we may
take &s;ome notice of their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Great Men at Court in that
Day, con&s;i&s;ted of the Duke of <HI>Somer|&s;et,</HI>
prime Mini&s;ter, Uncle to and
Protector of the King, Captain Gene|ral,
and <HI>Commander</HI> in <HI>Chief</HI> of all
his Forces; the Duke of <HI>Northum|berland,</HI>
formerly Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
of the antient Family of <HI>Dudley</HI>;
Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> a great Friend and A&s;|&s;i&s;tant
to the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>; Mr.
<HI>Cecil,</HI> Secretary of State; the Mar|qui&s;s
of <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
Among the&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
give a brief De&s;cription of a few;
The Two contending Factions, and
which made mo&s;t &s;tir with their
Strife, were the two Dukes of <HI>Somer|&s;et</HI>
and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> commonly
known in tho&s;e dangerous Times,
when People dur&s;t not &s;peak plain,
by the Di&s;tinction of Duke <HI>Blue,</HI>
and Duke <HI>Green,</HI> of which I can give
no other Account than by Traditi|on,
that the one being a <HI>Southern</HI>
Title, had reference to the Garter of
St. <HI>George.</HI> And the other being a
<HI>Northern</HI> Title, might have the like
to that of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> who&s;e En&s;igns
are the Blue and Green Ribband
But I do not find that the Per&s;on
was ever received as a Knight of that
Order.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Blue</HI> had great Per&s;onal Me|rit,
and was exceedingly beloved
both by the King and the People; he
was an able <HI>States Man,</HI> and a very
great <HI>Soldier</HI>; he had by his Wi&s;dom
and Prudence greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;et|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">g
the Prince upon the Throne,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and was his la&s;t re&s;ort for <HI>Council</HI>;
for as he had a great Intere&s;t a|mong
the People by his Fame, and a|mong
the Nobility by his great Al|liances
with the be&s;t Families; &s;o he
had a Mind always pre&s;ent to him|&s;elf
in the greate&s;t Exigence, and
was e&s;teemed to be the be&s;t Man of
<HI>Council</HI> of that Age, e&s;pecially upon
any dangerous Juncture. In the
Field, he was &s;uperior to him&s;elf, if I
may &s;o &s;ay; I mean, that there he
excelled not only all Mankind, but
even outdid all his own other Excel|lencies;
and this he &s;hew'd at that
memorable Battle of <HI>Pinkie,</HI> by which,
as well as on many other Occa&s;ions,
he had in the preceeding Reigns made
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Arms, as well as his own
<HI>Conduct,</HI> terrible to the World.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of his Per|&s;on,
it cannot be omitted, becau&s;e
&s;omething of it will come nece&s;&s;ari|ly
to be mention'd hereafter, that he
was not more happy in his own
<HI>Character,</HI> than he was unfortunate in
that of his Wife; a Woman of a
<PB N="20" REF="19">
terrible Spirit, in&s;upportably Haugh|ty,
Turbulent, Covetous, Treache|rous,
Revengeful, and being withal
bu&s;ie and medling in publick Mat|ters,
pu&s;h'd her Husband upon the
wor&s;t Scenes of his Life, and which
indeed ended in his Ruine. I have
only to add, that as their <HI>Charact|ers</HI>
were the Rever&s;e of one ano|ther,
&s;o was the influence they had
in the World; one being exceeding|ly
beloved, and the other univer&s;ally
hated by the People.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Green</HI> was of a <HI>Cha|racter</HI>
quite different from the other,
having very few good Qualities to re|commend
him; the be&s;t that could be
&s;aid of him was, that he was of a very
great and antient Family, famous for
Heroes, and Men of Gallantry and Cou|rage,
and was him&s;elf a Man of a da|ring
and enterpri&s;ing Courage. But
tho' he had on many Occa&s;ions &s;hewn
his Gallantry in Action, yet he was by
mo&s;t thought fitter to Command un|der
another, than to lead Armies as
General in Chief; yet in this it was
thought he had the Misfortune to dif|fer
from common Fame in the Opinion
of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
He &s;erv'd under Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> at the
great Battle of <HI>Pinkie</HI>; but was very
willing to have it &s;aid, that the great Vi|ctory
obtained that Day, was owing
more to his Conduct, than that of the
General, and had &s;ometimes the Vanity
to &s;ay, that if he had had the Com|mand,
the War would have been car|ried
on more to the King's Advantage;
however, as Duke <HI>Blue</HI> con&s;ented after|wards
to leave the Conduct of the War
to him for one Campaign, it did not ap|pear.</P>
<P>In
a Word, tho' they both appear'd
Friends to the King, and to his Intere&s;t,
and on all Occa&s;ions acted with their
utmo&s;t for his Service, yet it was well
known they were not cordial Friends to
one another; but did one another in
their Turn all the ill Offices they could,
till it brought Duke <HI>Blue</HI> fir&s;t to the
Block, and Duke <HI>Green</HI> followed in a
very little while after, the &s;ame Way.</P>
<P>In the Fate of Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> followed
&s;everal of his fa&s;t Friends, for Men of
&s;uch Figure &s;eldom fall alone, Mr. <HI>Stan|hope,</HI>
Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI>
<GAP DESC="blank"> and &s;everal others, were put to
Death, tho' all innocent, being meer
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Sacrifices to the political Rage of Duke
<HI>Green</HI>; and the King him&s;elf, who lived
but a little while after, yet lived to be
&s;atisfied of their Innocence, and to la|ment,
in the mo&s;t moving Terms, the
fatal Divi&s;ions of his Mini&s;ters, which
had brought him to cut off his mo&s;t
faithful Servants, and had impo&s;ed up|on
him, in a mo&s;t vile Manner, to &s;hut
his Ears again&s;t the Remon&s;trances of
his be&s;t Friends in their Favour; the bit|ter
Remembrance of which, follow'd the
good Prince to his Grave.</P>
<P>After the King's Death, Duke <HI>Green,</HI>
who was the chief Favourite of the
Succe&s;&s;or, a&s;&s;umed the Prime Mi|ni&s;try
and Management of Affairs. But
the <HI>Pretender</HI> got ground every Day,
tho' really, more by the Hatred the
People bore to Duke <HI>Green,</HI> than from
any real Di&s;affection to the Succe&s;&s;or;
at length the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or was
entirely abandoned by the Nation, tho'
a Per&s;on of the mo&s;t amiable Perfecti|ons,
mo&s;t agreeable and engaging Tem|per,
and mo&s;t perfect Virtue in the
World.</P>
<P>Thus a Popi&s;h Pretender was brought
in, the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e was lo&s;t, and
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or Depo&s;ed and
Murther'd, purely from the Hatred the
People bore to the wicked Actions of
him, who was then Head of the Party;
who&s;e Conduct was always ra&s;h and
fooli&s;h, and who having broken the U|nity
and Harmony which was before
happily carried on thro' all the publick
Affairs, had divided the Court, &s;ome
one Way, &s;ome another, particu|larly
had taken into the Admini&s;tration
People of quite differing Principles from
the King, and of views differing from
his Intere&s;t; which, it &s;eems, he did at
all Hazards, only to make his Party
&s;trong again&s;t his Enemy; nor was
Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> but e&s;pecially his Wife, back|ward
in the &s;ame unhappy Mea&s;ures,
making u&s;e of their Power with the
King, to bring in, and keep in &s;everal
People, both in the Army, in the Navy,
and in the Civil Affairs, &s;uch People as
were not Friends to His Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t,
&s;o be it they were Friends to their Par|ty,
and willing to engage again&s;t their
Oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>This being the Practice on both &s;ides,
they declar'd openly again&s;t one ano|ther,
and were openly called by the
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Neuters at Court, as well as by the Peo|ple,
the <HI>Blue Faction,</HI> and the <HI>Green
Faction.</HI></P>
<P>There was indeed another Sort, which
was called the <HI>third Party</HI>; the&s;e were
headed by Mr. <HI>Cecil,</HI> one of the Secre|taries
of State, and by the Per&s;on who
principally managed the King's Trea|&s;ure,
who&s;e Name I do not remember;
but they were too weak to carry on any
De&s;ign, and the King al&s;o was prevailed
with to di&s;countenance them, or at lea&s;t,
not to &s;hew them that Favour which
they at fir&s;t expected, &s;o that they
were able to do little; and the <HI>Blue</HI> and
<HI>Green</HI> Factions drawing all to them|&s;elves,
the&s;e &s;oon lo&s;t their principal Ad|herents,
who were drawn in to &s;ide
with one Faction or the other, as their
Profits or De&s;igns led them on.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> he was a weak,
or rather, indolent Per&s;on, who&s;e Cha|racter
was not extraordinary, and his
Body infirm; and Duke <HI>Green</HI> having
no kindne&s;s for him, and yet not ca|ring
to pu&s;h directly at him, becau&s;e he
thought the King had &s;ome kind|ne&s;s
for him, per&s;uaded him to re&s;ign
the Seals; he having de&s;ired to lo&s;e his
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Place with as little Di&s;grace as po&s;&s;ible.
The Seals were &s;oon after given to a
Per&s;on quite in another Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Di&s;&s;entions and Divi&s;ions
at Court, &s;ays a Reverend Hi&s;torian of
tho&s;e Times, it followed, that nothing
was &s;een during that ble&s;&s;ed King's Reign
but Troubles, Commotions, and Di&s;|quiets,
both in Church and State, till
Way was made, by the Di&s;tractions of
the State, to overthrow the whole Con|&s;titution,
de&s;troy the Reformation, and
let in Popery and Per&s;ecution in the
Reign that followed.</P>
<P>It is time to turn to our own Times,
to which we may make a &s;udden Tran|&s;ition,
without letting drop the Memo|ry
of what has been &s;aid. It had que|&s;tionle&s;s
been a piece of very happy
Advice, whoever had given it, if &s;ome
clear &s;ighted Per&s;on had in tho&s;e Days
earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd and advi&s;ed the States-Men
of King <HI>Edward</HI> to unite in their
Duty to the King, and their Care of
the Common-wealth, and not to &s;uf|fer
their Avarice or Ambition, their
Pride, or their Pa&s;&s;ions, to have any
&s;hare in the Mea&s;ures they were taking;
but to carry on the Publick Affairs with
Zeal, for the good of their Country, and
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the Intere&s;t of their Sovereign; fortify|ing
the King's Intere&s;t, by the good A|greement
of his Servants, and the Fide|lity
of his Councellors, which had they
done, they were able enough to have
tran&s;mitted the Crown to the Prote|&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;or, after the King's Death,
in &s;pight of all that <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Intere&s;ts could do to the contrary. For
it was even then true, that the Intere&s;t
of the Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or had very little,
if any Foundation in this Kingdom, but
what was founded among <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI>
them&s;elves; making good that old Axi|ome
of Policy, that <HI>England</HI> can never be
ruined, or her Liberties de&s;troy'd, by
any Power other than her own. So that
it was the Ignorance, Weakne&s;s, and Di|vi&s;ion
of <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> that &s;et the Crown
at that Time on the Head of <HI>Popery,</HI>
not the real Power of the <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Whether there may be any Parallel
drawn from tho&s;e Times to the pre&s;ent,
is not &s;o much the De&s;ign of this Work,
as it is to caution the greate&s;t Men of
the pre&s;ent Age again&s;t the Mi&s;chiefs of
Dividing and Separating them&s;elves in|to
Parties and Factions of any kind, as
the only fatal thing that can befal them
and the whole Kingdom at this Time,
<PB N="27" REF="26">
and leave the next Reign expo&s;ed to the
Di&s;a&s;ter of a <HI>Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Body of the People of <HI>En|gland</HI>
&s;eems now to be united under the
Reign of King <HI>George,</HI> and that Union is
&s;ettled and confirmed by the &s;teddy Ad|mini&s;tration
of his Maje&s;ty's Affairs; by
a well cho&s;en Mini&s;try, Faction is found
at pre&s;ent only among the Defeated Par|ty,
and their Di&s;appointments are made
irretrievable only by the Vigilance and
Unanimity of his Maje&s;ty's Councils
and Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rule, if that Vigilance
and Unanimity abates; if &s;ome draw one
Way, &s;ome another; if the Mini&s;ters of
State let go the Reins of the Admini|&s;tration,
and fall out one with another;
if the&s;e Conquerors fall out about divi|ding
the Spoil, where is the Strength
of the Admini&s;tration? What will all the
Victory they now triumph in amount
to? Faction will quit the routed Party
immediately, and harbour her hated
Head in the Verge of the very Hou&s;hold:
And what will follow, Divi&s;ions, Envy,
making and &s;trengthening of Parties at
<HI>Court,</HI> fortifying Intere&s;ts, and &s;upport|ing
them&s;elves with Numbers, &s;trug|gling
for Places, and bringing in Friends;
<PB N="28" REF="27">
and thus, in a Word, the <HI>Civil War</HI> will
be tran&s;po&s;ed from the remote Parts to
the very Walls of the King's Palace,
and which is wor&s;t of all, to the very
in&s;ide of tho&s;e Walls.</P>
<P>And not to repre&s;ent Things in a
more dangerous Po&s;ture than they real|ly
will repre&s;ent them&s;elves, I &s;hall lay
down a little the u&s;ual Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s
of Court Divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Court Divi&s;ions generally &s;pring
from two Fountains, <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI>;
I know there are two &s;ofter Words to be
given it, which are more Courtly in|deed,
but not more &s;ignificant, nor &s;o
ju&s;tly adapted to de&s;cribe the thing,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Ambition.</HI> and <HI>Emulation</HI>; but I
keep to the Terms. I think all the
Ambition we now &s;ee practi&s;ed may be
well &s;tyled Avarice, and all their Emula|tion
centers in Envy.</P>
<P>The&s;e creep in&s;en&s;ibly into Courts,
the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of it we find in the
Great Men engro&s;&s;ing Places of va&s;t Pro|fit,
many of them into one Hand; we
&s;aw lately a great Man po&s;&s;e&s;t of about
&s;even, if not more, Places of immen&s;e
Profit, and ju&s;tly di&s;mi&s;s'd for not be|ing
content with that.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
This prompts them to heave and
thru&s;t at one another, Picquing and Ca|balling
to &s;upport them&s;elves, and &s;up|plant
others; whether this be the Ca&s;e
among us now or not, it is not my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to enquire; it's evident this has fre|quently
been the Ca&s;e in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Court in former Times, and it is as evi|dent,
and for this Rea&s;on I mention it,
that this Party-making and dividing at
Court, never yet failed to overthrow
and turn out the Party that's &s;o divided;
and if this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e now, what
have we to expect?</P>
<P>Wherefore the People of <HI>England</HI> are
more than ordinarily concerned to u&s;e
the utmo&s;t Intere&s;t they have in the
pre&s;ent great Mini&s;ters, or tho&s;e to
whom the Admini&s;tration is intru&s;ted,
to per&s;uade, intreat, and in &s;hort, warn
them again&s;t dividing their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To begin this Per&s;ua&s;ion, I &s;hall take
the Liberty to tell a &s;hort Story, which
I am able to Name the Per&s;ons too who
were concerned.</P>
<P>Soon after the Re&s;toration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the IId. when the Civil War
was laid a&s;leep by the general Act of
Oblivion, many of the old Round-Head
Party began to appear openly,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
who had skulkt about for fear of the
Revenge of the Cavalier Party when
they &s;hould come in, and who expect|ed
to be pro&s;crib'd and excepted, as is u|&s;ual,
in the general Pardon.</P>
<P>One Major <HI>Gladman,</HI> an old Soldier,
and who had been very much concern|ed
in the Governing Party, was &s;itting
in a Coffee-Hou&s;e in the City &s;moak|ing
a Pipe, when an antient Gentleman
in a long Shoulder Belt, which was at
that Time the Badge of a Cavalier,
came and &s;at by him; he began very
high with him, Are not you &s;uch a
Man, Sir? Yes, Sir, replies the Major:
Then you are one of tho&s;e Fools, Sir, &s;ays
he, that have managed this poor Nation
after your wretched manner, and mu&s;t
give an Account to Heaven for what
you have done.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;o, Sir, replies the Major;
but, Sir, &s;ince the King has been plea&s;ed
to give an Act of Oblivion, and all the&s;e
Things are laid a&s;leep Sir, it is not the
kinde&s;t thing Gentlemen can do to us,
to in&s;ult us with it, when we have no
freedom to reply.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, the Act of Oblivion has
buried it, &s;ays the old Gentleman, and
I am not going to revive that; but
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Heaven will call you all to Account for
being the mo&s;t unaccountable&s;t Fools in
the World, that when He had given
you Victory, and committed the Na|tion
to your Government, and we poor
Cavaliers dur&s;t not &s;how our Faces in
the World, you, in a &s;hameful and
mo&s;t contemptible manner, pul|led
one another to pieces for the Spoil;
and giving up all your Advantages,
brought us in again with your own
Hands. Are you not a Parcel of Fools?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, &s;ays the Major, you have
toucht us in a &s;ore Place; if our Divi&s;i|ons
had not opened a Door for you, it
was impo&s;&s;ible you could ever have re|turned.</P>
<P>Let
all tho&s;e who God and King
<HI>George</HI> have entru&s;ted with any &s;hare of
the Honour and Tru&s;ts of the pre&s;ent
Government, &s;tand warned by &s;uch a
Story as this. Nothing can wound the
pre&s;ent <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of King <HI>George,</HI> nothing can
give Life to his Enemies, nothing can
revive the Jacobite Cau&s;e, in a Word,
nothing can effectually ruine us now,
but dividing.</P>
<P>Not all the Power of <HI>France</HI> can hurt
us, we &s;ee that cringing, and reduced,
and complying with any Conditions
<PB N="22" REF="31">
to get an Alliance with us for their
own Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Not all the other Popi&s;h Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> can hurt us; we &s;ee them &s;olli|citing
and entreating to be admitted in|to
the &s;ame Alliance for their Security.</P>
<P>Not all the Jacobite High-flying Party
at Home; we &s;ee them reduced, and the
Pallace of the King crouded with Peti|tioners,
begging Reprieves for their
principal Leaders, to &s;ave them from
the Scaffold and the Gallows.</P>
<P>What then can hurt us, what can
be capable to weaken our Hands, &s;o
&s;trengthen'd by Conque&s;t? to weaken
our Mea&s;ures directed by &s;uch Heads,
to &s;lacken the Reins of our Admini|&s;tration,
committed to &s;uch; nothing
but private Feuds and Factions, no|thing
but Divi&s;ions among our &s;elves;
and then no Government is &s;o fixt, no
King &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd, no Con&s;titution
&s;o well founded, but it will undo, and
overthrow it.</P>
<P>Let us go among the High Party,
and hear what they &s;ay, and indeed
we need go no farther to confirm
the Argument, what is it has given
Life to their dejected Souls, bright|en'd
<PB N="33" REF="32">
their Countenances, and put their
Expectations again upon the Wing.</P>
<P>It was but the other Day that
all their broken Reeds having fail'd
them, they were brought to give up
their Cau&s;e, and to confe&s;s they had
nothing left to do but to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Now they are another People; they
promi&s;e them&s;elves new Scenes, flat|ter
them&s;elves with new Hopes, and
encourage one another to new Mi&s;|chiefs;
we &s;ee their Leaders meet|ing
in Cabals, great Conferences held
upon the pre&s;ent Scituation of their
Affairs, and Mea&s;ures taken with a&s;|&s;urance
of Succe&s;s, for the Forming
their Intere&s;t, and Propagating their
Cau&s;e, even to <HI>Avignon</HI> it &s;elf the
Encouragement is &s;pread; and we have
Letters from thence, which &s;ay, their
Friends in <HI>England</HI> give them En|couragement
to look for great Things
in their Favour, for that, &s;ay they,
we are a&s;&s;ured there are great Divi|&s;ions
at Court; that the <HI>Whigs</HI> are
fallen out among them&s;elves; that
<HI>Argyle</HI> being out on one Hand, and
<HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI> on the other, great In|tere&s;ts
are made to bring them in
<PB N="34" REF="33">
again, which there is &s;ome hopes of;
that, on the contrary, great Parties
are made again&s;t them; and that by
means of the&s;e Di&s;&s;entions, the Friends
to another Intere&s;t are care&s;s'd more
than u&s;ual; for that States Men ne|ver
value who they take into Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
if it be found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port
them again&s;t their Opppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>To conclude, the be&s;t Con&s;truction
which I can make of the whole Mat|ter
is, in Favour of this Intelligence
from <HI>Avignon,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it is a
meer piece of Jacobite News; that
indeed it is an idle Rumour, or a
malicious one; that it is impo&s;&s;ible
it &s;hould be true; and that the Ca&s;e
at Court &s;tands directly thus, and
no otherwi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That there is an entire Harmony
and Unity in every Part of the <HI>Ad|mini&s;tration</HI>
among the <HI>Mini&s;ters of
State</HI>; that there is not &s;o much as
the lea&s;t Jealou&s;ie, Unea&s;ine&s;s, or Mi&s;|under&s;tanding
among them; that a
perfect Friend&s;hip and good Corre|&s;pondence
&s;preads it &s;elf through the
<PB N="35" REF="34">
Minds and <HI>Management</HI> of all the
great Men at Court, and an exact
<HI>&V;niformity</HI> in their Mea&s;ures; that if
there is any Ambition among them,
it is only in the great Struggle, to
render their Augu&s;t Ma&s;ter the be&s;t
Services; be mo&s;t vigilant for his
Safety, and mo&s;t vigorous in Oppo|&s;ition
to his Enemies the Jacobites.</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, that all the Rumours
&s;pread aborad of <HI>Factions</HI> in the Court,
and of Divi&s;ions into Parties looking
this Way, and that Way, are Chi|merical,
Groundle&s;s, and of no Value,
and are not to be regarded other|wi&s;e,
than to let us &s;ee, to what the
Jacobite <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> tends, what they
drive at, and what we are to expect
from them, if ever that fatal Time
&s;hould come, when the <HI>Mini&s;ters of
State</HI> &s;hould break and divide from
one another, and open the Gaps and
Breaches which the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
had &s;o happily clo&s;ed.</P>

abroad, growing in the Affections of
the People at home; Rebellion, like
the Dragon under the Feet of St. <HI>George,</HI>
is conquer'd, and lies grovelling in the
Du&s;t; <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> is reduc'd to a <HI>State</HI>
of <HI>De&s;pair</HI>; <HI>Popery</HI> has laid by its Pre|ten&s;ions;
and &s;uppliant <HI>France</HI> &s;eeks
Aid at our Court again&s;t her own <HI>State</HI>
Factions.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> have nothing
to wi&s;h which they do not enjoy, they
have nothing to do but to Congratu|late
one another, and enjoy in Com|mon
the full Favour of their Prince, do
their Duty, and receive the Reward of
their Fidelity.</P>
<P>Can it be po&s;&s;ible then that the&s;e
Men &s;hould fall out with one another?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
Can there be Room among them
for Ambition, or Envy, or Faction, &s;o
much as to put a Foot in? no, 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible. Do they not &s;wim in a full
Sea of the King's Bounty? Are not all
their Foes made their Foot&s;tool? Have
they not all that, one would think, Ava|rice
or Ambition could prompt them
to ask? What can they without blu&s;h|es,
de&s;ire of their Country more than
they enjoy?</P>
<P>For the&s;e Men to fall out, to di|vide
into Factions and Parties, what
would it be, but to tell the World,
that they are not the Men they have
been taken for; that however they
have made Pretences to be di&s;inter|e&s;ted,
and to have &s;erv'd King <HI>George</HI>
purely for the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e,
and the good of their Country, that
yet they are true <HI>States Men,</HI> that they
are of the &s;ame Mold with others that
went before them; that their aim has
been all along their own Intere&s;t, the
&s;atisfying their own voratious Appe|tites,
and the mo&s;t unbounded Ava|rice;
that Pride, and the wor&s;t &s;ort
of Ambition, has been the Helm that
&s;teers all their Actions, and that no|thing
<PB N="42" REF="43">
but to be above one another,
can make Peace among them; in a
Word, that every Man wants to be
prime <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> and cannot bear to
&s;ee any <HI>Man</HI> have a Share of Power
or of Favour equal with him&s;elf; in
which they mu&s;t make good Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI>'s &s;aying rever&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Courtiers of every Party are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Men to divide, and bandy
again&s;t one another, as it has been
&s;candalou&s;ly &s;aid of them, would be
to tell the World, they have no va|lue
for King <HI>George,</HI> no regard to
his Intere&s;t, no concern for his Safe|ty,
or his Family; that they &s;erve
Him only for what they can get
by Him, and in Hopes of getting
the &s;upreme Management under Him;
and care not what Hazard they run
of his Intere&s;t, to &s;ecure their own.
For this Rea&s;on, one cannot without
the greate&s;t Contempt of their Per|&s;ons
and De&s;igns, and thinking them
the mo&s;t Perfidious Generation of
Men in the World, I &s;ay, one <HI>cannot</HI>
&s;o much as entertain a Notion of
their being any ways Guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
Should Divi&s;ion and Faction creep
in among the pre&s;ent <HI>Mannagers</HI> of
Affairs, what mu&s;t we expect? in|deed,
what may we not expect, but
that the whole Party &s;hould divide
as they divide, and where will this
end? <HI>If a Kingdom divided again&s;t its
&s;elf cannot &s;tand,</HI> how &s;hall a Party
divided again&s;t it &s;elf be &s;upported?
And if this pre&s;ent <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> divide
again, what is before them, but
that the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Tories,</HI> and
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> which has been bro|ken
and trampled under Foot, purely
by the Harmony and Unanimity of
<HI>Councils,</HI> with which His Maje&s;ty's
Affairs have been ble&s;s'd, &s;hall re|vive
and overwhelm us all: United
as we were, <HI>none can &s;ay</HI> we were
not in Danger, and next to God's
directing Providence, nothing but the
Vigilance and &s;teddy Conduct of the
King and his Mini&s;try, united toge|ther
Heart and Hand, to &s;urprize and
circumvent the Enemy, render'd their
too well laid De&s;igns abortive.</P>
<P>If that Unity is broken, if the
Eyes that &s;hould watch for the pub|lick
<PB N="44" REF="45">
Safety, are employed in an en|vious
Glancing at one another, watch|ing
their private Advantages, to &s;up|plant
and di&s;place, e&s;tabli&s;h and bring
in, as their own ambitious Views
direct; what will become of the pub|lick
Intere&s;t? Who will look out for
that? And how will the Ship of State
run on Ground and &s;plit upon the
Rocks, while the Pilots forget to
<HI>Steer,</HI> and are falling out among
them&s;elves?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step which Party Men
generally take to &s;upport them&s;elves,
when they lay De&s;igns one again&s;t
another, is, to &s;trengthen them&s;elves
with <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Dependents,</HI> who
&s;hall be ready at all Times to &s;erve
and &s;upport them, e&s;pecially where
<HI>any thing</HI> that may injure them is
to be pa&s;&s;ed by Votes. To do this,
they make u&s;e of their <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> with
the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> to recommend and
bring &s;uch <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> into pub|lick
<HI>Employment,</HI> as well to keep
others out, as to fortifie their <HI>own
Intere&s;t</HI>; for Numbers has always
<PB N="45" REF="46">
been e&s;teemed a great Thing at
Court.</P>
<P>To do this, we always find they
make no &s;cruple to court mu|tually
in their turn, I &s;ay, to court
the Party that are out, who they
bring into play, upon Pretence of
their being turn'd, or of having pro|mi&s;ed
to be directed.</P>
<P>This was what the Courtiers did
in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, when the
Lord <HI>Haver&s;hame</HI> de&s;cribed it by
that unhappy, but &s;ignificant Word,
a <HI>Motley Mini&s;try</HI>; and how far
that Motley Mini&s;try went towards
ruining that Prince's Affairs, is too
recent in Memory to be forgot.
How far the like Folly would go
to ruine our pre&s;ent Affairs, we ought
to tremble to think of.</P>
<P>When the Parties thus bring in
their Enemies, Two Things fre|quently
follow, and indeed, &s;eldom
fail.<LIST>
<PB N="46" REF="47">
<ITEM>1. That they cannot, when they
find their mi&s;take, get them out
again.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they often ma&s;ter and
throw out tho&s;e that brought
them in.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We need not look far back for
Examples of this Kind, the People
now at Court know too much of
this. Truth, to have any occa&s;ion to
be put in Mind of it. The Court
Revolution of 1709, is an eminent
In&s;tance of it, and to that they are
referred.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter is, that
it cannot, without mo&s;t uncommon,
and mo&s;t injurious Reflections upon
the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration be &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
that there are any Mi&s;under|&s;tandings,
Dividings, or Factions a|mong
them; their Hone&s;ty will not
permit it, their Sen&s;es mu&s;t be their
Protection again&s;t it, they cannot
do it without being Fools to them|&s;elves,
Traytors to King <HI>George,</HI> and
<PB N="47" REF="48">
Knaves to their Country, and for
this Rea&s;on I conclude that it is all
fal&s;e, a meer Rumour, rai&s;ed by their
Enemies to amu&s;e the World, &s;can|dalize
the Government, and bouy up
their own &s;inking Party.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould appear to be otherwi&s;e,
you &s;hall hear farther.</P>
