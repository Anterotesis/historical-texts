<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU reque&s;t from me, with infinitely more
importunity than the thing is worth, a
copy of the &s;hort compari&s;on between Mr.
Fox's India Bill and Mr. Pitt's, which I read
in my place in the Hou&s;e of Commons in the
la&s;t day's debate upon the Declaratory Act.
I now &s;end it to you, with a number of notes
or ob&s;ervations, which I have been induced
to add to it, from a de&s;ire of complying more
fully with what I conceive to be your object in
a&s;king for the paper. I have been led into
more length than I intended on the &s;ubject,
and this mu&s;t be my apology for not having
obeyed your commands &s;ooner.</P>
<P>You will perceive, however, that I have
not, in the&s;e remarks, paid your judgment &s;o
ill a compliment as to have endeavoured to
engage your attention by laboured argu|ments;
<PB N="4" REF="3">
&s;till le&s;s by any attempt at ornament.
I have endeavoured merely to be intelligible,
and to confine the illu&s;trations I adopt, to
facts. If, upon the whole, you &s;hould be of
opinion that the&s;e papers contain a fair &s;tate|ment
of the true meaning of the two Bills,
and &s;ome ju&s;t comments upon that meaning,
they are at your di&s;po&s;al to be put into any
per&s;on's hands you plea&s;e, or to be given to
the public, if it is thought worth while to
do &s;o.</P>
<P>The compari&s;on it&s;elf I wrote in the Hou&s;e
of Commons during the debate, from feeling
it, I confe&s;s, a teazing circum&s;tance to hear
gentlemen of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable abilities day
after day arguing upon, and drawing paral|lels
between, the provi&s;ions of the two Bills,
upon which it was perfectly obvious they had
not conde&s;cended to be&s;tow any very minute
degree of attention: and conceiving it to be
no very difficult ta&s;k to reduce the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion
to a plain and conci&s;e &s;tatement of fact.
With regard to Mr. Fox's Bill, I do venture
peremptorily to a&s;&s;ert, that there never was
a legi&s;lative mea&s;ure &s;o little examined, &s;o
generally mi&s;under&s;tood, and &s;o confidently
mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>You acknowledge your&s;elf to be one of
tho&s;e who have been in &s;ome degree of error
on the &s;ubject; and you confe&s;s that you
now begin to &s;ee the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, as well
as the conduct of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, in a
<PB N="5" REF="4">
new point of view; and that you meet with
many who confe&s;s the &s;ame. Nay, &s;ome even
of tho&s;e who were formerly mo&s;t violent on
this topic, have in your hearing acknowledg|ed,
you &s;ay, (and you &s;eem to expect me to
triumph in the intelligence), that "Mr. Pitt's
Bill is very like, if not quite as bad as Mr.
Fox's."&mdash;You will forgive my &s;aying, how|ever,
that this is a compromi&s;e which we ne|ver
&s;hall accept, even as the overture of re|turning
confidence from tho&s;e who&s;e good
opinion we mo&s;t regretted to lo&s;e. In fact,
there is no re&s;emblance between the two Bills
in any circum&s;tance, excepting only the little
ceremony with which they both treated the
Charter of the Company; nor could any per|&s;on
who &s;upported Mr. Fox's Bill, and &s;till
approves the mea&s;ure, give his countenance
to Mr. Pitt's, with the &s;malle&s;t degree of con|&s;i&s;tency.&mdash;But examine the &s;ubject fairly
your&s;elf upon the plain ground of fact.&mdash;I
will not attempt to bias your opinion by any
previous argument.</P>
<P>You will receive with this a copy of the
other Bill brought in by Mr. Fox, (which
you &s;ay you never &s;aw) intitled, "A Bill for
the better Government of the Territorial
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Dependencies in India."
This Bill accompanied what is u&s;ually called
"<HI>Mr. Fox's India Bill,</HI>" but is &s;eldom men|tioned,
altho' it formed a very e&s;&s;ential part
of the plan; and the con&s;ideration of it is
<PB N="6" REF="5">
extremely nece&s;&s;ary to the under&s;tanding the
principle, and main object of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I &s;end you al&s;o a copy of Mr. Pitt's Bill, as
it came out of the Committee, when it was
re-printed, with its alterations and amend|ments.
In looking it over, I do not de&s;ire
you to take notice of the ludicrous manner
in which it is pieced and patched, and cor|rected
and altered, almo&s;t from the beginning
to the end, merely to convince you of the &s;ad
&s;lovenly &s;tyle in which the act was framed,
but in order that you may compare the &s;pirit
and obvious purpo&s;e of &s;ome of the&s;e altera|tions,
with the text as it fir&s;t &s;tood; by doing
which you will be much better enabled to
judge of the true meaning of the original Act,
than by any thing you can learn from the De|claratory
Law.</P>
<P>As to the Declaratory Law it&s;elf, and the
plea which was made for it,&mdash;we &s;eem to be
perfectly agreed upon that &s;ubject. The pa|pers
laid before the Hou&s;e of Commons, cer|tainly
contain, as you ob&s;erve, a complete
refutation of all the pretences upon which the
&s;ending out the four regiments to India was
defended as <HI>a mea&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> And &s;till
more &s;trongly do I agree with you in your
remarks upon <HI>Declaratory Acts</HI> in general,
and upon the nature of this Declaratory Act
in particular. It is indeed an alarming and
an unfortunate event in the Hi&s;tory of Parli|ament
<PB N="7" REF="6">&mdash;for it is one that &s;hakes the founda|tion
of that &s;ecurity which all men hope from
Law, and of that re&s;pect which all men owe
to it&mdash;to &s;ee the Repre&s;entatives of the people
per&s;uaded to intercept the ordinary cour&s;e of
ju&s;tice, to a&s;&s;ume them&s;elves a judicial cha|racter,
and, upon the &s;ugge&s;tion of the King's
Mini&s;ters, to determine a que&s;tion of proper|ty,
in favour of the &s;ervants of the Crown,
again&s;t the claims of the &s;ubject!</P>
<P>Nor can our apprehen&s;ions of the con&s;e|quences
of this precedent be dimini&s;hed, by
reflecting upon the manner in which the
mea&s;ure was carried thro' the Hou&s;e of Lords;
by reflecting, that the &s;upreme court of judi|cature
in this country &s;hould have been in|duced
by any influence or by any eloquence,
or upon any plea of nece&s;&s;ity, pretended or
real, to decide&mdash;with unparalleled precipita|tion,&mdash;upon a con&s;truction of law&mdash;in the
ab&s;ence of the Judges of the land, and with|out
granting a hearing to the parties intere&s;t|ed
in their deci&s;ion!</P>
<P>Yet po&s;&s;ibly you will be &s;urpri&s;ed when I
add, that it is <HI>becau&s;e</HI> I perfectly and cordially
agree with you in your ob&s;ervations upon
the&s;e proceedings, that I do not &s;o readily
adopt the conclu&s;ion you have drawn with
regard to the advantage which, "the ex-par|ty"
(I u&s;e your own phra&s;e) is &s;uppo&s;ed to
have obtained in con&s;equence of the weak
conduct of the Admini&s;tration in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
If this party,&mdash;who&s;e general principles,
fidelity of attachment, and openne&s;s of con|duct,
you own you re&s;pect&mdash;but own it with
the &s;plenetic reluctance of one who has been
in vain endeavouring to look for &s;y&s;tem, uni|nion,
or plain dealing el&s;ewhere&mdash;If this par|ty
had no other object but to retort popular
invectives, to detect the &s;ini&s;ter views of po|litical
adver&s;aries, to le&s;&s;en the confidence of
Parliament in their mea&s;ures, or to &s;hake the
opinion of their con&s;equence in another quar|ter,
there undoubtedly was cau&s;e for con&s;i|derable
triumph in the late events:&mdash;and of
&s;till fairer triumph, perhaps, in the opportu|nity
afforded of vindicating their own cha|racters
under circum&s;tances of great advan|tage,
and upon grounds the mo&s;t embarra&s;|&s;ing
to their opponents. But under&s;tanding,
as I tru&s;t I do, the terms and conditions up|on
which alone that party will ever &s;eek to
obtain, or con&s;ent to hold, mini&s;terial &s;itua|tions
in this country, I never &s;hall admit that
their cau&s;e can be e&s;&s;entially advanced by any
legi&s;lative mea&s;ure which tends to lower the
Hou&s;e of Commons in the public e&s;timation,
and to deprive Parliament of the re&s;pect and
confidence of the country.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, whatever advantage
this or that &s;et of men may gain in debate,
or in public opinion,&mdash;<HI>Their</HI>'s only is the tri|umph,
who love not the popular part of our
Con&s;titution, who&s;e credit and who&s;e prin|ciples
<PB N="9" REF="8">
pro&s;per in the aba&s;ement of all popular
character, and who would at any time be
content to participate in the reproach of an
odious mea&s;ure, provided it reflected &s;uperi|or
di&s;grace on Parliament, as the in&s;trument
of effecting it.&mdash;But I am getting upon
ground which may lead us from the &s;ubject
I wi&s;h to pre&s;s to your more immediate at|tention.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore only add, that
I am,</P>

<P>THE PROFESSED OBJECT of the Two Bills
for the better Government of the Briti&s;h Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
in India, brought into Parliament, the one by Mr.
FOX, in 1783, and the other by Mr. PITT, in
1784, was to relieve the Natives of that Country,
from the many evils which they had experienced un|der
the Dominion of, or in con&s;equence of their Con|nection
with, the Government of the Company of the
United Merchants trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies. It
was a&s;&s;umed by the Framers of both Bills, that this
Relief was not to be expected from the Government
of the Company, con&s;tituted as it then was; and it
was admitted by both, that the Patronage and Influ|ence
of the Company ought not to be transferred to the
Crown.</P>

<HI>reward</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment, military promotion,</HI>
and <HI>the pur&s;e</HI> of the Company; will it be credited,
that any many &s;hould have been &s;tout enough to
a&s;&s;ert in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that <Q REND="inline">the <HI>whole
bu&s;ine&s;s of Patronage</HI> was left <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> in the

to them!!!</Q></P>
<P>In truth, the que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">Whether or not the
pre&s;ent Board of Controul po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole, or
any &s;hare of the Patronage in India?</Q> has lately
been placed in a plainer light by the unguarded
confe&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who &s;upported the Declaratory
Bill, than by any thing that could be &s;aid by tho&s;e
who oppo&s;ed it. Some gentlemen defined the au|thority
<PB N="27" REF="25">
of the Board on this head to be, <Q REND="inline"><HI>a power
of circuitous nomination</HI>;</Q> others, <Q REND="inline"><HI>appointment
by the weight of influence</HI>;</Q> others, <Q REND="inline"><HI>the right of
authoritative recommendation</HI>;</Q> but by whatever
name it is called, or however the exerci&s;e of it
may be di&s;claimed, the&s;e facts are plain, 1&s;t, That
all the unbounded means of Patronage and Protec|tion
which the <HI>Governor General</HI> and the Pre&s;idents
of the different Councils po&s;&s;e&s;s, belong to tho&s;e
to whom in reality they owe their appointments,
and to whom only in fact they owe obedience.
2dly, That the Board of Controul are obviou&s;ly
&s;eizing the whole of the <HI>Military</HI> Patronage into
their own hands, the intention of extingui&s;hing the
Company's &s;ervice being plainly avowed. 3dly,
That no per&s;on can look for protection to any
quarter but to <HI>the Board,</HI> or think of accepting any
appointment again&s;t <HI>their</HI> will, in the <HI>civil</HI> line.</P>
<P>One di&s;tinction, however, is con&s;tantly taken
upon this &s;ubject, namely, that Mr. Pitt's Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
do not meddle with the <HI>Patronage at
home,</HI> which it is affirmed would have been at the
di&s;po&s;al of Lord Fitzwilliam's Board, under Mr.
Fox's Bill. This Patronage, whatever it is, is
always magnified, and never explained. As far as
it means the nomination of Clerks, and other of|ficers
at the India Hou&s;e, it is not an object very
much worth di&s;pute: but as far as it relates to
contracts, and money laid out in &s;hipping and trade
at home, it &s;hould not be forgotten, that the ma|nagement
of the&s;e matters was not placed in Lord
Fitzwilliam's Board, by Mr. Fox's Bill, but in a
Board of <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tant Directors,</HI> appointed by Parlia|ment
from among the then exi&s;ting Directors or
Proprietors of India Stock, for that &s;pecial pur|po&s;e.
The&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tant Directors, however, being
bound to obey the orders of the Superior Board,
Lord Fitzwilliam <HI>might</HI> have commanded their
<PB N="28" REF="26">
Patronage, and perverted their commercial deal|ings
to his own political purpo&s;es&mdash;granted&mdash;there
was certainly no &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;o flagrant an
abu&s;e of tru&s;t, but in the character of the per&s;on
tru&s;ted; and what rea&s;on is there to think that the
pre&s;ent Board of Controul have no weight of in|fluence
with re&s;pect to this very Patronage, if they
cho&s;e to act as they &s;uppo&s;e Lord Fitzwilliam would
have done? Or, who is there that does not &s;ee that
the Court of Directors are becoming every day
mere in&s;truments in the hands of this Board, and
that there can be nothing of exclu&s;ive Patronage
belonging to them, more than would have belong|ed
to the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Directors under Mr. Fox's Bill?
In plain &s;en&s;e, the whole and only difference, in
point of Patronage, between the two Boards, is,
that by Mr. Fox's Bill it was given <HI>directly,</HI> and
mu&s;t have been exerci&s;ed <HI>openly</HI>; by Mr. Pitt's
Bill it is given <HI>circuitou&s;ly,</HI> and may be exerci&s;ed
<HI>&s;ecretly.</HI></P>

<P>" <HI>Appeal to the King.</HI>&mdash;"] The application to the
<HI>King in Council,</HI> which Mr. Pitt's Bill declares it
&s;hall be <HI>lawful</HI> for the Court of Directors to make,
whenever they conceive the orders of the Board
not to <HI>relate</HI> to <HI>points connected</HI> with the Civil or
Military Government and Revenues in India, is a
&s;trange mockery, when gravely held out to the
Company as a &s;ecurity again&s;t encroachment or
interference in Commercial matters, on the part
of the Board of Controul. It proves, however,
how perfectly di&s;tinct, in theory at lea&s;t, the fra|mers
of this Bill con&s;idered the Board of Controul,
from the general executive government of the
country:&mdash;the limits of the authority of the Di|rectors
are circum&s;cribed within certain bounds,
and if they tran&s;gre&s;s them, or refu&s;e obedience
<PB N="29" REF="27">
where the law has commanded them to pay it, re|dre&s;s
is provided in the common cour&s;e of law.
The law al&s;o pre&s;cribes limits to the authority and
controul of the Commi&s;&s;ioners; but it provides no
redre&s;s &s;hould they tran&s;gre&s;s them. The mo&s;t
flagrant abu&s;e of their tru&s;t under their own Bill,
would be in any in&s;tance to a&s;&s;ume the management
of the Company's Commerce; yet if they can
craftily effect this, they may do it with impunity;
and whenever they are oppo&s;ed, if they can pro|cure
the &s;anction of the Council on their &s;ide, that
is, fairly &s;peaking, of them&s;elves in a different
character&mdash;they have the law on their &s;ide al&s;o!</P>
<P>But there is nothing more curious than to ob&s;erve
the prepo&s;terous and degrading office which the&s;e
zealous advocates for the dignity and prerogatives
of the Crown, have provided for the Monarch, were
ever &s;uch an appeal to be made.&mdash;His Maje&s;ty, in
Council, &s;hall decide, <Q REND="inline">whether the di&s;patch, or
order, referred to his Royal judgment, be, or be
not, connected with the <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Military</HI> Go|vernment

parties &s;hall conde&s;cend to favour him with, upon
&s;ubjects wholly removed from the ordinary con|templation
of his Maje&s;ty's Government. Mr.

to <HI>his department exclu&s;ively</HI>&mdash;being a mea&s;ure relat|ing
to <HI>war,</HI> or <HI>peace,</HI> or <HI>negociation</HI> or <HI>revenue</HI>; and
that therefore his <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> ought to have
been implicitly obeyed. The Directors humbly
contend, without pre&s;uming to que&s;tion the <HI>&s;ove|reignity</HI>
of the Board of Controul, that the mea|&s;ure
is of a <HI>Commercial</HI> nature merely.&mdash;His Maje&s;ty
&s;its the unprincely umpire between his contending
<PB N="30" REF="28">
&s;ubjects, deciding upon the extent of Imperial
prerogatives, in the exerci&s;e of which he has nei|ther
will nor voice.</P>
<P>But, if any thing further were wanting to &s;hew
the falacy of this pretended &s;ecurity to the rights
of the Company, we find it amply made out in the
notable device of compelling the <HI>Directors to e&s;tabli&s;h</HI>
a <HI>Secret Committee,</HI> to be <HI>&s;olely under the orders of
the Board of Controul.</HI> The Secret Committee was
accordingly &s;oon employed contrary to the profe&s;&s;ed
purpo&s;e of its in&s;titution; and it was as &s;oon pre|dicted,
that the whole affair of an appeal to the
King in Council, might at once be evaded by the
Board of Controul directing, through their Secret
Agents, as matter <HI>connected</HI> with <HI>revenue</HI> or <HI>negotia|tion,</HI>
whatever <HI>commercial</HI> arrangement they plea&s;ed.&mdash;But it occurred to no man, that the Board would
be &s;o unwary, at lea&s;t till the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be
more fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to endeavour to adopt a
precedent for a right of <HI>direct controul</HI> and <HI>manage|ment</HI>
over <HI>commercial</HI> matters, without cover or pre|tence,
by means of or in collu&s;ion with, the Secret
Committee: yet has this already been the ca&s;e.
The Secret Committee, (to whom, however, no
<HI>intentional</HI> ill-conduct is meant to be imputed,) on
the fir&s;t of June 1786, a&s;&s;ume, in concert with the
Board of Controul, powers from which both by
law and the nature of their tru&s;t, they were equally
excluded. They take upon them&s;elves to direct a
<HI>purcha&s;e of cotton</HI> to be made at Bombay, for expor|tation
to China, and order five &s;hips to receive the
cargo; and direct the remittance of a con&s;iderable
&s;um from home, to an&s;wer the expence, all with|out
the authority or knowledge of the Directors.
The Board of Controul approve the mea&s;ure, and
the di&s;patch, in the following terms, unguardedly
called in the Hou&s;e of Commons,&mdash;"<HI>blindly lending
their name in the u&s;ual form.</HI>"</P>

The differences which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the
Court of Directors and the Board of Controul, have
not been upon <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> or upon <HI>matters of opinion,</HI>
or upon trivial points; but all of them upon que&s;|tions
of <HI>right,</HI> of <HI>law,</HI> and upon the <HI>nature</HI> and
<HI>limits</HI> of their re&s;pective <HI>powers.</HI> Such differences,
however, will probably no more be heard of.&mdash;The la&s;t ineffectual &s;truggle of the Company ap|pears
to have been made. In one di&s;pute they
tried in vain to obtain the Mini&s;ter's countenance
to apply to the Repre&s;entatives of the People to
arbitrate between them and the Board of Controul.
In another, they reque&s;ted to be permitted to ap|ply
to the King;&mdash;this was al&s;o refu&s;ed. In the
la&s;t, they looked for redre&s;s in an appeal to the
Courts of Ju&s;tice; in this they were fru&s;trated by
the Legi&s;lature being induced to think it proper to
decide the point, and <HI>declare</HI> the law again&s;t them.
Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;hut out from Law, Parlia|ment,

that the Court of Directors will no more

<HEAD>(E) FOURTH ESTATE.</HEAD>
<P>" <HI>New E&s;tate or Department</HI>&mdash;"] The purpo&s;es
and characters of men have been often mi&s;repre|&s;ented
and mi&s;under&s;tood through the efforts and
prejudices of party; but it is a mo&s;t &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance
that nearly a whole nation &s;hould have
been per&s;uaded to under&s;tand a Bill pa&s;&s;ed in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, and given to the public in
print, in a manner directly contrary to its plain
meaning and expre&s;s provi&s;ions; and that even
&s;ober and rational men &s;hould have joined in the
outcry again&s;t it, without giving them&s;elves the
trouble to examine whether it really was the mea|&s;ure
which it was repre&s;ented to be.</P>
<P>Whatever other faults were found with Mr.
Fox's Bill, nothing certainly operated more in
the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t it, than a con|fu&s;ed
notion that it &s;ome way or other attacked the
prerogatives of the Crown, and aimed to take from
the King certain powers and authorities which of
right belonged to him. This idea, whether urged
by the mob as <Q REND="inline"><HI>an attempt to take the Crown from
the King's head,</HI></Q> or, in the politer jargon, of a
<Q REND="inline"><HI>fourth e&s;tate,</HI></Q> and <Q REND="inline"><HI>imperium in imperio,</HI></Q> was
certainly a main ingredient in the delu&s;ion which
pervaded the country at the la&s;t general election.
Yet is it utterly impo&s;&s;ible for any man of common
&s;en&s;e to read the Bill <HI>attentively,</HI> without being
puzzled to gue&s;s at the ground upon which &s;uch a
deception could &s;o long have been maintained.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox's Bill enacted in fact nothing new of any
&s;ort with re&s;pect to the Royal Authority; nor did it
contain any one thing in derogation of any one pre|rogative
of the Crown. If the exi&s;tence of <HI>Direc|tors
for the management of the affairs of the Ea&s;t India</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="33">
<HI>Company</HI> con&s;tituted a <HI>fourth E&s;tate,</HI> that fourth
e&s;tate exi&s;ted before; and this very phra&s;e is to be
found in pamphlets written again&s;t this very Com|pany
twenty years &s;ince. If a <HI>parliamentary</HI> no|mination
of per&s;ons to be concerned in the govern|ment
of India, was an <HI>attack upon the con&s;titution,</HI> the
con&s;titution had &s;u&s;tained and &s;urvived a &s;imilar
attack in the Regulating Act of 1773, and in the
&s;ub&s;equent Bills which repeated tho&s;e <HI>Parliamentary</HI>
appointments. If the employing the Patronage of
the Company, without the King's authority, was
an <HI>inva&s;ion of his prerogative,</HI> it was of a prerogative
never heard of, for the Crown had never had the
grant of a &s;ingle office, civil or military, belonging
to the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t India Company. In fact
&s;o far as the Crown was concerned at all, it acquir|ed,
in the right of nominating to the vacant offices
in the new commi&s;&s;ion, a power the King had ne|ver
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before. Whether the <HI>new</HI> Directors
for the affairs of India were likely to make a <HI>better
government</HI> than the <HI>old,</HI> is not the que&s;tion; the
extraordinary circum&s;tance is, that this Bill, which
left the Crown <HI>in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its prerogatives</HI>
of <HI>war, peace,</HI> and <HI>negotiation</HI> in India, &s;hould have
been repre&s;ented as <HI>depriving it of its ju&s;t rights,</HI> and
rai&s;ing a <HI>Parliamentary commu&s;&s;ion above its authority</HI>;
and that Mr. Pitt's Bill, which <HI>actually &s;trips the
Throne</HI> of tho&s;e main en&s;igns of <HI>Imperial authority</HI>;
&s;hould have been univer&s;ally admitted at lea&s;t to
have the merit of a <HI>due deference to the rights and
per&s;on of the Sovereign!</HI></P>
<P>However, when people are pre&s;&s;ed to explain
what their meaning is&mdash;they are compelled to own,
that when they &s;peak of a <HI>fourth e&s;tate,</HI> and an <HI>over|throwing
of the con&s;titution,</HI> and an <HI>attack upon the pre|rogative,</HI>
they do not mean that all this was done,
or attempted by the Bill, but&mdash;that the&s;e things
<HI>might</HI> have come to pa&s;s in con&s;equence of it;&mdash;<PB N="36" REF="34">
becau&s;e, &s;ay they, a great political party having
got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Patronage</HI> of India for four
years, they would in&s;tantly have become &s;o &s;trong,
that the King could not ea&s;ily have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them;
and &s;o the <HI>prerogative would have been invaded.</HI> This
party would al&s;o in time, by means of this Patro|nage,
have been able to obtain a predominant par|ty
in Parliament; and &s;o the <HI>con&s;titution would have
been de&s;troyed.</HI> Now, to make any &s;en&s;e of the fir&s;t
objection, it is nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ert, as all violent
people did, that, although the King &s;he &s;hould have
thought proper to have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the <HI>Duke of Port|land's
Admini&s;tration,</HI> and had been equally de&s;irous
of changing the <HI>Indian Admini&s;tration,</HI> yet that Lord
Fitzwilliam, and his Board, could have held com|plete
and independent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government
of India for four years, in &s;pight of his Royal
wi&s;hes, and have applied all the Patronage and in|fluence
of their &s;ituation to the &s;upport of the ex|mini&s;ters.
This is literally what every man meant
who meant any thing, or who had any &s;incere alarm
on the &s;ubject. That the mere vulgar, or very
ignorant people, &s;hould have adopted this notion,
is not very &s;trange, con&s;idering the pains which
were taken to circulate it; but that a per&s;on of
LORD CAMDEN'S character, accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider
laws with temper and deliberation, &s;hould now
again have gravely detailed all this &s;ort of argument
in the Hou&s;e of Lords, have warned them again&s;t this
<HI>fourth e&s;tate,</HI> this <HI>imperium in imperio</HI> a&s;&s;erting, as is
reported,<Q REND="inline">that had his Maje&s;ty thought proper, by
virtue of his undoubted prerogative, to have di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
Mr. Fox and his party from his &s;ervice, we
might have &s;een the <HI>King of Great Britain,</HI> and the
<HI>King of Bengal,</HI> contending in Parliament for &s;upe|riority,</Q>

<PB N="37" REF="35">
and perver&s;e notion before &s;tated, that the Board
appointed by it, was placed out of the reach, and
above the controul, of the King's Mini&s;ters for the
time being. Two gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of
Commons, of great ability and character, Mr.
SCOTT and Mr. HARDING&mdash;confe&s;&s;ed very can|didly
that they had been in a mi&s;take with re&s;pect
to this part of the Bill; they &s;till, however, per|&s;i&s;ted
to argue upon conclu&s;ions founded upon ac|knowledged
error.</P>
<P>What is the real ca&s;e?&mdash;Mr. Fox's Bill enacts,
<Q REND="inline">that the <HI>&s;aid Directors hereby appointed,</HI> or any
three of them, &s;hall have, u&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;s, exerci&s;e,
all and &s;ingular the powers and authorities which
have been, at any time heretofore, ve&s;ted in, or
lawfully exerci&s;ed by, the &s;aid Directors hereby
di&s;continued, or Proprietors, or by the General
Court of Proprietors of the &s;aid United Compa|ny,
and all &s;uch farther and other powers and
authorities, and <HI>under &s;uch directions,</HI> and <HI>&s;ubject
to &s;uch limitations and re&s;trictions as in this act,</HI> or
<HI>in</HI> ANY OTHER ACT, the provi&s;ions where of ARE
NOT HEREBY ALTERED OR REPEALED, are con|tained
for the government and management of
the &s;aid territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, revenues, and
commerce, of the &s;aid United Company, or in
any wi&s;e relative thereto. And further, that in
all ca&s;es what&s;oever, where any act, matter, or
thing, is directed to be done or con&s;ented to, or
any accounts or writings to be &s;igned by the Di|rectors
hereby di&s;continued; <HI>&s;uch act, matter,

of this act, be <HI>done</HI> or con&s;ented to; and
&s;uch accounts or writings &s;hall be &s;igned by <HI>three
of the Directors hereby appointed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, in order to under&s;tand what the real &s;itu|ation
of <HI>the new Directors</HI> would have been, and
what the extent of their powers, it &s;hould &s;eem
<PB N="38" REF="36">
that the natural thing was, to examine what <HI>were</HI>
the <HI>directions, limitations,</HI> and <HI>re&s;trictions,</HI> not ex|pre&s;sly
repealed, under which they were left? In
this ca&s;e it would have appeared,&mdash;that Lord FITZ|WILLIAM
and his Board were bound to communi|cate
to his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters for the time being,
<HI>an exact copy of all di&s;patches and letters received from
India, or propo&s;ed to be &s;ent thither, which &s;hould</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">ANY WAY RELATE to the REVENUES, or to the
CIVIL and MILITARY affairs and GOVERNMENT
of the &s;aid <HI>United Company.</HI></Q>&mdash;That Lord FITZ|WILLIAM
and his Board were bound <Q REND="inline"><HI>to pay</HI> DUE
OBEDIENCE <HI>to, and to be</HI> GOVERNED <HI>and</HI> BOUND
<HI>by, &s;uch</HI> INSTRUCTIONS <HI>as they &s;hould receive</HI>
FROM HIS MAJESTY, <HI>by one of his Maje&s;ty's prin|cipal
Secretaries of State,</HI> IN ALL THEIR CON|DUCT,
<HI>and</HI> TRANSACTIONS, <HI>(and in tho&s;e of their
Governors, Pre&s;idents, and Councils re&s;pectively,)
with the</HI> COUNTRY POWERS <HI>in the Ea&s;t Indies,
and al&s;o in regard to the</HI> LEVYING WAR <HI>and</HI> MAK|ING
PEACE.</Q>&mdash;That Lord FITZWILLIAM and
his Board had no means of u&s;ing the credit of the
Ea&s;t India Company for the relief of the Compa|ny's
pre&s;&s;ing di&s;tre&s;&s;es, <Q REND="inline"><HI>without the</HI> CONSENT <HI>and</HI>

provi&s;ion for the defence of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in
the Ea&s;t Indies, were bound to act <Q REND="inline"><HI>on the requi|&s;ition,
and under the in&s;pection of the Commi&s;&s;ioners
of his Maje&s;ty's Navy, and Office of Ordnance.</HI></Q>&mdash;Upon the whole, it would have appeared that their
Board was placed, in every important matter, un|der
&s;o &s;trong a controul of the <HI>Mini&s;ters for the
time being,</HI> and &s;o wholly without the power of
acting upon their own judgment or di&s;cretion, in
all the more important objects of their in&s;titution,
that no &s;et of men, who were not content from
<PB N="39" REF="37">
the meane&s;t motives, to hold the <HI>appearance</HI> of
power upon the mo&s;t abject conditions, could have
remained in their Offices a week, with an Admini|&s;tration
de&s;irous to get rid of them. Let the&s;e
plain facts be once under&s;tood, let the &s;tate of &s;ub|ordination
of the new Directors to the King's Go|vernment
be fairly examined, and it will be appa|rent
at once,&mdash;that without having recour&s;e to a
Parliamentary addre&s;s,&mdash;the Duke of Portland's
Admini&s;tration once di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the re&s;ignation of
Lord Fitzwilliam's Board mu&s;t have followed in|&s;tantly;
that is, if it was the object of the advi&s;ers
of the Crown to change the Indian Government;&mdash;if <HI>otherwi&s;e,</HI> undoubtedly Lord Fitzwilliam and
his a&s;&s;ociates were at liberty to continue in a labo|rious
duty, without pay or emolument, and inca|pacitated
from accepting any place of profit from
the Crown, and to &s;acrifice their ea&s;e and their
time under Mini&s;ters with whom they had no bond
of union, nor habits of regard, from a de&s;ire to do
good, and to effect the great pupo&s;es of their ap|pointment&mdash;the reform of the abu&s;es in India,
and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h character.
To execute this tru&s;t faithfully, a rigid &s;crutiny
into pa&s;t mi&s;conduct, a &s;evere oeconomy in future
arrangements, a ju&s;t, di&s;intere&s;ted, and impartial
management of Patronage, would have been among
the fir&s;t duties expected from them. While they
<HI>&s;o</HI> acted, if it was the King's plea&s;ure, his Mini|&s;ters,
whoever they were, might certainly have <HI>ab|&s;tained</HI>
from the exerci&s;e of the deci&s;ive controul
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over them; but then, wherein would
have con&s;i&s;ted the attack on the prerogative, or
the danger of the Con&s;titution? But &s;uppo&s;ing a
different conduct to have been pur&s;ued by the
Board;&mdash;that forgetting what they owed to their
own characters, as well as to the duties of their &s;ta|tion,
they had perverted the powers of their tru&s;t,
<PB N="40" REF="38">
and had endeavoured to employ them &s;olely to
an&s;wer party purpo&s;es at home;&mdash;the remedy
was at hand, and the fir&s;t application of it mu&s;t
have been effectual.</P>
<P>This being the fact, an objection of a different
nature may, no doubt, be in&s;tantly made, namely,
that as the King was to nominate to <HI>vacancies upon
re&s;ignation,</HI> the Bill might have been u&s;ed not to
<HI>de&s;troy,</HI> but to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the power of the Crown;&mdash;the truth is, that it were much to be wi&s;hed
that this objection could be as ea&s;ily an&s;wered as
the other. MR. GRENVILLE was the only per&s;on
connected with the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, who
argued the Bill upon this ground, at the time of its
pa&s;&s;ing through the Hou&s;e of Commons. The fair
an&s;wer, however, is, that there was every &s;ecurity
taken again&s;t this wor&s;t of mi&s;chiefs, which the
nature of the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, and the urgent nece&s;|&s;ity
which called for it, admitted of. The public
had a pledge in the characters of the per&s;ons who
framed that Bill, in the whole tenor of their poli|tical
life, and in their recent and hone&s;t exertions
to reduce the influence of the Crown, that it was
not <HI>their</HI> intention at lea&s;t, to deceive or delude
them upon this &s;ubject.&mdash;If the&s;e Mini&s;ters were
di&s;placed, there was the &s;ame &s;ecurity in the cha|racter
of the Indian Board, and in the very prin|ciple
upon which it had been formed. If <HI>they</HI>
too were obliged to abandon their &s;ituation, the&s;e
&s;ecurities certainly vani&s;hed; and the Crown might,
<HI>for whatever term remained of the four years,</HI> have
placed the powers given to the Parliamentary tru&s;|tees,
in the hands of its own creatures. But this
could not have been done <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> or <HI>&s;ilently</HI>&mdash;not
without &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion&mdash;not without the at|tention
of the Public being immediately and for|cibly
drawn to the &s;ubject and to the characters
and principles of the new Board; no new ar|rangement
<PB N="41" REF="39">
could pretend to claim the confidence
of a Parliamentary nomination; Parliament mu&s;t
therefore have had the matter before them in a
new point of view and have become acce&s;&s;ory to
the &s;urrender, if they were to be &s;urrendered, of
tho&s;e powers and that patronage to the Crown,&mdash;which all parties profe&s;&s;ed &s;o much to dread to &s;ee
lodged there.&mdash;Again&s;t &s;uch a conduct in Par|liament
there is certainly no remedy, nor ever
will be.</P>
<P>The only thing like an objection on this head re|maining,
is, that upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that his Ma|je&s;ty
had been plea&s;ed to continue the Duke of
Portland's Admini&s;tration for the term of four years,
for which the India Board was appointed, the &s;up|po&s;ed
good under&s;tanding between the Mini&s;ters
and the new India Government, would have given
them an opportunity of u&s;ing the Company's influ|ence
and Patronage, to make friends, and to create
an intere&s;t which might have been of u&s;e to them
at the end of that term. This undoubtedly <HI>might</HI>
have been the ca&s;e, but not without an abu&s;e of
their tru&s;t; and again&s;t this the public had certainly
no &s;ecurity but in the character of the Board. In
a compari&s;on, however, of the two Bills, it is ob|vious
to a&s;k,&mdash;what &s;ecurity have the public again&s;t
the &s;ame thing now? The means of Patronage
and influence to all important purpo&s;es were before
proved to be equal; and if Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dun|das
have for their object the attaching a <HI>powerful
Indian intere&s;t,</HI> both at home and abroad, to <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI>
who that ob&s;erves and under&s;tands the mea|&s;ures
daily pur&s;ued, both with regard to the <HI>Direc|tors,</HI>
the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> the <HI>Army,</HI> and the <HI>Governments</HI>
and <HI>Councils</HI> abroad, can be &s;o duped as not to own,
that a very few years more mu&s;t make <HI>them</HI> as for|midable
as Indian influence and attachment, &s;o
concentred and headed, can make any party.</P>

only &s;uch orders and directions as they &s;hall receive
from the Board of Controul, which orders and di|rections
they &s;wear al&s;o never to communicate to
the Directors, who appoint them, without the con|&s;ent

Committee have no power of originating or direc|ing
any thing to be done of their own authority,
&s;till le&s;s, by &s;ugge&s;tion or in&s;truction from the Di|rectors;
all the Governments and Pre&s;idencies,

would be no difficult matter to prove that this

make rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary. The

<P><PB N="44" REF="42">
Nothing could be more clearly out of the &s;pirit
and meaning of the Act of 1784, than this mea|&s;ure.
The Board of Controul had already a&s;&s;umed
an arbitrary power of &s;ettling the debts due from
the Nabob to <HI>individuals,</HI> as <HI>matter connected with
revenue.</HI> The Directors conceived they might at
lea&s;t have been permitted to &s;ettle <HI>their own</HI> debt,
which was their property, and &s;tated as part of
their effects to Parliament; but this was di&s;covered
to be&mdash;<HI>matter connected with negociation.</HI> The Board
of Controul had no power to i&s;&s;ue their orders,
through the <HI>Secret Committee,</HI> with re&s;pect to mat|ters
of <HI>revenue</HI>; but with re&s;pect to <HI>treaties</HI> with
<HI>native Princes,</HI> they had: accordingly the &s;ettling
a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for an old and public debt to
the Company, due from a dependent on their Go|vernment,
was converted into <HI>a negociation of &s;tate,</HI>
deemed a matter of &s;ecre&s;y, and withdrawn even
from the knowledge of tho&s;e who alone had any
title to the debt. The Directors apply to their
Coun&s;el; and they are truly informed by Mr. Rous,
that <Q REND="inline">the whole effect of the la&s;t Regulating Bill,
in con&s;tituting the two Boards of Directors and
of Commi&s;&s;ioners, the one propo&s;ing mea&s;ures,
and the other, after repre&s;entation, finally de|ciding,
will be lo&s;t, as far as concerns the Go|vernment
of Madras, <HI>if the intercour&s;e with the
Nabob &s;hall be confined to the Secret Department</HI>;
becau&s;e this intercour&s;e involves directly, the
arrangements re&s;pecting the military force, and
indirectly, <HI>every intere&s;t of that &s;ettlement.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The di&s;pute comes before the Court of Proprie|tors,
who re&s;olve, on the 30th of June 1786,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">that the con&s;truction of the Act of the 24th of
his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, under which the Right
Honourable Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Af|fairs

<P>Upon this the Court of Directors re&s;olve, that
<Q REND="inline">it is expedient to apply to the Legi&s;lature for a

<P><HI>Agree upon its Meaning.</HI>] THE Declaratory Law
was defended by many, upon the ground of its
declaring no more power to be in the Board of
Controul than it was fit and rea&s;onable to give them;
and that to &s;uppo&s;e that the Original Act had given
them le&s;s, was to admit that Parliament had enacted
an ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent law. This argument,
altho' a popular one, and &s;anctioned&mdash;altho' a popu|lar
one&mdash;by LORD HAWKESBURY, is an intolerably
bad argument when applied to Parliament, acting
in a great mea&s;ure in their judicial capacity: It is
to &s;et up their pride again&s;t their ju&s;tice; and to
pique them to commit an act of violence, rather
than confe&s;s an act of folly. Other Members,
<PB N="48" REF="46">
however, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament profe&s;&s;ed
that <HI>they</HI> &s;upported the Declaratory Law, as a true
con&s;truction of Mr. Pitt's Bill, from a recollection
of <HI>their own meaning</HI> at the time they voted for it.
Yet few of the&s;e Members agreed with each other,
as to the powers they conceived they <HI>had</HI> given to
the Board of Controul. LORD CAMDEN having
been out of the kingdom when the Act of 1784
pa&s;&s;ed, profe&s;&s;ed to have nothing to &s;ay to the <HI>inten|tions</HI>
of the Legi&s;lature in pa&s;&s;ing the Act, but to
have formed <HI>his</HI> opinion upon <Q REND="inline">the plain and ob|vious
meaning of <HI>the clau&s;es taken collectively.</HI></Q>
The learned Lord was obliged, however, to admit,
that there were many words omitted which were
nece&s;&s;ary to make out his in&s;truction, and ma|ny
others in&s;erted which directly contradict|ed
it; but this he pre&s;umed to have happen|ed
through <HI>inadvertency</HI>; and therefore a whole
clau&s;e coming under the latter de&s;cription&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><HI>nil operatur.</HI></Q> A new and mo&s;t extraordinary
mode, the mo&s;t unlearned man may venture to a&s;|&s;ert,
of interpreting laws affecting the rights and
property of the &s;ubject!</P>
<P>But the plea&s;ante&s;t ground was taken by the
DUKE of RICHMOND. The noble Duke declared
he had voted <HI>again&s;t</HI> Mr. Pitt's Bill, becau&s;e he
<HI>differed</HI> at the time from tho&s;e who had introduced
it with re&s;pect to its meaning. <HI>He</HI> thinking that it
<HI>did</HI> actually give tho&s;e powers to the Board of Con|troul,
which <HI>they</HI> a&s;&s;erted were <HI>not</HI> meant to be gi|ven.
It now therefore appearing that they had
come over to <HI>his</HI> opinion, <HI>con&s;i&s;tency</HI> demanded from
him to give vigour and efficacy to a law&mdash;which
ju&s;tice and policy had convinced him ought never
to have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>It would certainly be a difficult ta&s;k to argue on
the <HI>intentions</HI> of different Members at the time the
Act of 1784 pa&s;&s;ed, and a very unfair way of argu|ing
with re&s;pect to any but tho&s;e who publicly gave
<PB N="49" REF="47">
their enterpretation of the Bill, during its progre&s;s.
Mr. BASTARD'S quotations from the Mini&s;ter's for|mer
&s;peeches &s;eem to have been generally admit|ted
to have contained a true expo&s;ition of the Mi|ni&s;ter's
former meaning; but there is one deci&s;ive
te&s;t ea&s;ily recurred to, which was very ably argued
upon by Mr. POWIS; namely, to compare the
Bill in the &s;tate in which it was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> brought into
the Hou&s;e by Mr. Pitt, with <HI>that</HI> to which he altered
it, after a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with the Directors, in the
Committee. Here it will deci&s;ively appear that
many of the&s;e very powers which are <HI>now</HI> contend|ed
to be given to the Board of Controul, by <HI>con|&s;truction</HI>
and <HI>implication,</HI> were <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>plainly</HI>
given in the Bill as <HI>it &s;tood on its fir&s;t reading,</HI> and
were afterwards withdrawn or modified upon <HI>con|ference</HI>
and <HI>explanation</HI> with the&s;e who objected to
them, as intrenching on right which they had not
con&s;ented to yield.&mdash;This evidence is conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>" <HI>Explain the original Act</HI>&mdash;"] THERE is no
in&s;tance, perhaps, wherein the extraordinary &s;pirit
in which Mr. Pitt's Bill is worded, appears more
plainly than in its bold and irregular manner of re|pealing
matters &s;uppo&s;ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the
new enactments.</P>
<P>In all the former Acts we find a regard to per&s;pi|cuity

After this, to enact a law to place them in their

<P><PB N="53" REF="51">
The right of the Company under this compact
is&mdash;not to <HI>the property</HI> of the revenues certainly,
but to a <HI>deci&s;ion</HI> upon the &s;ubject on the expiration
of their charter of exclu&s;ive trade, or to be placed
in the &s;ame &s;ituation with <HI>re&s;pect to their claim</HI> in
which they &s;tood when they made their bargain.
In lieu of this, a <HI>new Claimant</HI> is created by Par|liament,
being <HI>neither the public</HI> nor the <HI>Company,</HI>
to whom the law gives the <HI>perpetual di&s;po&s;al</HI> of the&s;e
revenues &s;o claimed by the public on one part, and
the Company on the other. For it is to be remem|bered,
(granting the Board of Controul to be act|ing
for the Crown) that the King is <HI>not</HI> the re|pre&s;entative
of the <HI>Public,</HI> with re&s;pect to their
<HI>property</HI> and <HI>pur&s;e</HI>; but that on the contrary the
Con&s;titution regards with jealou&s;y, and places
no tru&s;t in the Crown upon that head; &s;o that
the <HI>Public</HI> would be defrauded, although the re|venues
were to come under the di&s;po&s;al of the
<HI>King.</HI> But even that is not the ca&s;e; for the
Board of Controul can appropriate them <HI>without
the direction of the Crown,</HI> as well as without the di|rection
of the Company, or of Parliament. Par|liament
therefore breaks its faith to the Company,
without doing ju&s;tice to the Public; and the title
and claims of both are extingui&s;hed, not in favour
of the Crown, but in favour of a FOURTH ESTATE,
which acquires the &s;trange and anomalous right ei|ther
of di&s;po&s;ing of the PROPERTY OF INDIVIDU|ALS,
again&s;t their con&s;ent, or of applying the PRO|PERTY
OF THE STATE without the &s;anction of Par|liament.</P>
