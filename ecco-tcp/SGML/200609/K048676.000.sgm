<HEAD>The DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which &s;eem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily &s;en&s;e and the faculties of moral perception: They have been call'd by a very general name, THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION. Like the external &s;en&s;es, they relate to matter and motion; and at the &s;ame time, give the mind ideas analogous to tho&s;e of moral approbation and di&s;like. As they are the inlets of &s;ome of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures we are acquainted with, men of warm and &s;en&s;ible tempers have &s;ought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford, independent of the objects which originally produc'd them. This gave ri&s;e to the imitative or de&s;igning arts; &s;ome of which, as painting and &s;culpture, directly copy the ex|ternal appearances which were admir'd in nature; others, as mu&s;ic and poetry, bring them back to remembrance by &s;igns univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;h'd and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>But the&s;e arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imagina|tive powers; e&s;pecially poetry, which making u&s;e of language as the in&s;trument by which it imitates, is con&s;equently become an unlimited repre&s;entative of every &s;pecies and mode of being. Yet as their primary intention was only to expre&s;s the objects of imagination, and as they &s;till abound chiefly in ideas of that cla&s;s, they of cour&s;e retain their original character, and all the different plea&s;ures they excite, are term'd, in general, PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the following poem is to give a view of <HI>the&s;e,</HI> in the large&s;t acceptation of the term; <HI>&s;o that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertain|ment we meet with either in poetry, painting, mu&s;ic, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of tho&s;e principles in the con&s;ti|tution of the human mind, which are here e&s;tabli&s;h'd and explain'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">
In executing this general plan it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to di&s;tingui&s;h the imagination from our other faculties, and then to characterize tho&s;e original forms or properties of being about which it is conver&s;ant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the under&s;tanding. The&s;e properties Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> had reduc'd to the three general cla&s;&s;es of greatne&s;s, novelty, and beauty; and into the&s;e we may analy&s;e every object, however complex, which, properly &s;peaking, is delightful to the imagination. But &s;uch an object may al&s;o include many other &s;ources of plea&s;ure, and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion by rea&s;on of this concurrence. Be&s;ides this, the imitative arts, e&s;pecially poetry, owe much of their effect to a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> exhibition of properties quite <HI>foreign</HI> to the imagination; in&s;omuch that in every line of the mo&s;t applauded poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external &s;en&s;es, or truths di&s;cover'd to the under&s;tanding, or illu&s;trations of contrivance and final cau&s;es, or above all the re&s;t, with circum&s;tances proper to awaken and ingage the pa&s;&s;ions. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate and exemplify the&s;e different &s;pecies of plea&s;ure; e&s;pecially that from the pa&s;&s;ions, which as it is &s;upreme in the noble&s;t works of human genius, &s;o being in &s;ome particulars not a little &s;urpri|zing, gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance.</P>
<P>After the&s;e parts of the &s;ubject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and intere&s;t the mind, a plea&s;ure of a very different nature, that which ari&s;es from ridicule, came next to be con&s;ider'd. As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a particular illu&s;tration, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the general &s;ources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd. Here too a change of &s;tile became nece&s;&s;ary; &s;uch a one as might yet be con&s;i&s;tent, if po&s;&s;ible, with the general ta&s;te of compo&s;ition in the &s;erious parts of the &s;ubject: nor is it an ea&s;y ta&s;k to give any tolerable force to images of this kind, without running either into the gigantic expre&s;&s;ions of the mock-heroic, or the familiar and pointed raillery of profe&s;s'd &s;atire; neither of which would have been proper here.</P>
<P>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now remain'd but to illu&s;trate &s;ome particular plea&s;ures which ari&s;e either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation it&s;elf. Of the fir&s;t kind is that various and complicated re&s;emblance exi&s;ting between &s;everal parts of the material and immaterial
<PB N="7" REF="5">
worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure to depend on the early a&s;&s;ociations of our ideas, and as this habit of a&s;&s;ociating is the &s;ource of many plea&s;ures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great &s;hare in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mention'd here and its effects de&s;crib'd. Then follows a general account of the production of the&s;e elegant arts, and the &s;econdary plea&s;ure, as it is call'd, ari&s;ing from the re&s;emblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After which, the de&s;ign is clos'd with &s;ome reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral u&s;efulne&s;s in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of compo&s;ition which prevails in this piece, little can be &s;aid with propriety by the author. He had two mo|dels; that antient and &s;imple one of the fir&s;t <HI>Graecian</HI> poets, as it is refin'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the <HI>Georgics,</HI> and the familiar epi&s;tolary way of <HI>Horace.</HI> This latter has &s;everal advantages. It admits of a greater variety of &s;tile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of conver&s;ation; and e&s;pecially with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rhyme, leads to a clo&s;er and more conci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion. Add to this the example of the mo&s;t perfect of modern poets, who has &s;o happily applied this manner to the noble&s;t parts of philo&s;ophy, that the public ta&s;te is in a great mea&s;ure form'd to it alone. Yet, after all, the &s;ubject before us tend|ing almo&s;t con&s;tantly to admiration and enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;eem'd rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figur'd &s;tile. This too appear'd more natural, as the author's aim was not &s;o much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the mo&s;t ingaging pro&s;pects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imaginati|on, and by that means in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;po&s;e the minds of men to the &s;ame dignity of ta&s;te in religion, morals, and civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is &s;o careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human con&s;titution here in&s;i&s;ted on; and al&s;o to unite the moral excellencies of life in the &s;ame point of view with the meer external objects of good ta&s;te; thus recommending them in common to our natural propen&s;tiy for admiring what is beauti|ful and lovely. The &s;ame views have al&s;o led him to introduce &s;ome &s;entiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as not quite direct to the &s;ubject; but &s;ince they bear an obvious relation to it, the authority of <HI>Virgil,</HI> the faultle&s;s model of didactic poetry, will be&s;t &s;upport him in this particular. For the &s;entiments them&s;elves he makes no apology.</P>

But the in&s;tance of <HI>habit</HI> is oppos'd to this ob&s;ervation; for <HI>there,</HI> objects at fir&s;t di&s;ta&s;teful are in time render'd intirely agreeable by repeated attention.</P>
<P>The difficulty in this ca&s;e will be remov'd, if we con&s;ider, that when objects at fir&s;t agreeable, lo&s;e that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly <HI>pa&s;|&s;ive</HI> and the perception <HI>involuntary</HI>; but habit, on the other hand. generally &s;uppo&s;es <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> accompanying it: &s;o that the plea&s;ure ari&s;es here not from the object, but from the mind's <HI>con&s;cious</HI> determination of its own activity; and con&s;equently increa&s;es in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will &s;till be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with di&s;agreeable objects ren|ders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to <HI>re&s;olve</HI> or <HI>act</HI> at all. In this ca&s;e, the appearance mu&s;t be accounted for, one of the&s;e ways.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure from habit may be meerly negative. The object at fir&s;t gave un|ea&s;ine&s;s: this unea&s;ine&s;t gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at la&s;t intirely removed, reckons its &s;ituation really plea&s;ura|ble, compar'd with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The di&s;like conceiv'd of the object at fir&s;t, might be owing to prejudice or want of attention. Con&s;equently the mind being nece&s;&s;itated to review it often, may at length perceive its own mi&s;take, and be reconcil'd to what it had look'd on with aver&s;ion. In which ca&s;e, a &s;ort of in&s;tinctive ju&s;tice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury, by running toward th e other extreme of fondne&s;s and attachment.</P>
<P>Or la&s;tly, tho' the object it&s;elf &s;hould always continue di&s;agreeable, yet cir|cum&s;tances of plea&s;ure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an a&s;|&s;ociation may ari&s;e in the mind, and the object never be remember'd without tho&s;e plea&s;ing circum&s;tances attending it; by which means the di&s;agreeable im|pre&s;&s;ion it at fir&s;t occa&s;ion'd will in time be quite obliterated.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>But others there are who believe <HI>beauty</HI> to be meerly a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent de&s;ign in nature to annex &s;o delightful a &s;en&s;ation to tho&s;e objects which are <HI>be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in them&s;elves,</HI> that &s;o we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without &s;taying to infer their <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s</HI> from their &s;tructure and effects; but that it is not impo&s;&s;ible, in a phy&s;ical &s;en&s;e, that two beings, of equal capacities for <HI>truth,</HI> &s;hould perceive, one of them <HI>beauty,</HI> and the other <HI>deformity,</HI> in the &s;ame relations. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, by that <HI>truth</HI> which is always connected with <HI>beauty,</HI> nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to tho&s;e proportions upon which, after careful examination, the beauty of that &s;pecies is found to depend. <HI>Polycletus</HI> for in&s;tance, the famous &s;culptor of <HI>Sicyon,</HI> from an accurate men&s;u|ration of the &s;everal parts of the mo&s;t perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or &s;y&s;tem of proportions, which was the rule of all &s;ucceeding arti&s;ts. Suppo&s;e a &s;tatue modell'd according to this canon. A man of meer natural ta&s;te, upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confe&s;&s;es and admires its <HI>beauty</HI>; whereas a profe&s;&s;or of the art applies his mea&s;ures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beauty, pronounces the work|man&s;hip to be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>true.</HI></P></NOTE></L>

He has one pa&s;&s;age &s;o full and clear on the head, that I am per&s;uaded the reader will be plea&s;ed to &s;ee it here, tho' &s;omewhat long.

One of the&s;e parts is yours, O unhappy man! which tho' in it&s;elf mo&s;t incon&s;iderable and minute, yet being connected with the univer&s;e, ever &s;eeks to co-operate with that &s;upreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into exi&s;tence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; exi&s;ting, as it does, not for your &s;ake, but the cau&s;e and rea&s;on of your exi&s;tence, which, as in the &s;ymmetry of every artificial work, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity concur with the general de&s;ign of the arti&s;t, and be &s;ub&s;ervient to the whole of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundle&s;s; &s;ince according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a con&s;tant provi&s;ion of that which is be&s;t at the &s;ame time for you and for the whole.&mdash;For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and &s;elf|moving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diver&s;ifies them, con|&s;idering fir&s;t of all by what di&s;po&s;ition of things, and what &s;ituation of each indi|vidual in the general &s;y&s;tem, vice might be depre&s;&s;ed and &s;ubdued, and virtue made &s;ecure of victory and happine&s;s with the greate&s;t facility and in the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;ible. In this manner he order'd thro' the entire circle of being, the internal con&s;titution of every mind, where &s;hould be its &s;tation in the univer&s;al fabric, and thro' what variety of circum&s;tances it &s;hould proceed in the whole tenour of its exi&s;tence.</HI> He goes on in his &s;ublime manner to a&s;&s;ert a future &s;tate of retribution, <HI>as well for tho&s;e who, by the exerci&s;e of good di&s;po&s;itions being harmonized and a&s;&s;imilated to the divine virtue, are con&s;equently removed to a place of unblemi&s;h'd &s;anctity and happine&s;s; as of tho&s;e who by the mo&s;t flagitious arts have ari&s;en from contemptible beginnings to the greate&s;t affluence and power, and whom therefore you look upon as unan&s;werable in&s;tances of negligence in the Gods, becau&s;e you are ignorant of the purpo&s;es to which they are &s;ub&s;ervient, and in what manner they contribute to that &s;upreme intention of good to the whole.</HI> <BIBL>Plato de Leg. x. 16.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This theory has been deliver'd of late, e&s;pecially abroad, in a manner which &s;ubverts the freedom of human actions; whereas <HI>Plato</HI> appears very careful to pre&s;erve it, and has been in that re&s;pect imitated by the be&s;t of his followers.</P>

<L>Of fancy neither le&s;&s;en nor enlarge<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>&mdash;where the pow'rs</L><L>Of fancy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the mo&s;t important points in moral philo&s;ophy. It were ea&s;y by an in|duction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almo&s;t all the pa&s;&s;ions, and mixes with almo&s;t every circum&s;tance of action or plea&s;ure. Let any man, even of the colde&s;t head and &s;obere&s;t indu&s;try, analy&s;e the idea of what he calls his intere&s;t; he will find that it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of certain images of decency, beauty and order, variou&s;ly combined into one &s;y&s;tem, the idol which he &s;eeks to injoy by labour, hazard, and &s;elf-denial. It is on this account of the la&s;t con&s;equence to regulate the&s;e images by the &s;tandard of nature and the general good; otherwi&s;e the imagination, by heightening &s;ome objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by repre&s;enting others in a more odious or terrible &s;hape than they de&s;erve, may of cour&s;e engage us in pur&s;uits utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of the moral order.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that this account of things &s;uppo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in &s;ome a natural and hereditary di&s;po&s;ition to certain pa&s;&s;ions prior to all circum&s;tances of education or fortune; it may be an&s;wer'd, that tho' no man is born <HI>ambitious</HI> or a <HI>mi&s;er,</HI> yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which &s;hall render his imagination more liable to be &s;truck with &s;ome particular objects, con&s;equently di&s;po&s;e him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain pa&s;&s;ions of a par|ticular turn. Some men, for in&s;tance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted with the va&s;t and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle a&s;pects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the moral powers is always &s;imilar to this of the imagination; that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t inclin'd to admire prodigious and &s;ublime objects in the phy&s;ical world, are al&s;o mo&s;t inclin'd to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While tho&s;e who are charm'd rather with the <HI>deli|cacy</HI> and <HI>&s;weetne&s;s</HI> of colours, and forms, and &s;ounds, never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the &s;ofter &s;cenes of virtue and the &s;ympathies of a dome|&s;tic life. And this is &s;ufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philo&s;ophers, tho' we have &s;everal hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the <HI>Socratic</HI> &s;chool, yet the <HI>Stoics</HI> were the fir&s;t who paid it a due attention. <HI>Zeno,</HI> their founder, thought it impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently in&s;pecting tho&s;e pictures or appearances of things which the imagina|tion offers to the mind. (<HI>Diog. Laert. l.</HI> vii.) The meditations of <HI>M. Aurelius,</HI> and the di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Epictetus,</HI> are full of the &s;ame &s;entiments; in&s;omuch that this latter makes the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, or <HI>right management of the fancys,</HI> the only thing for which we are accountable to providence, and without which a man is no other than &s;tupid or frantic. <HI>Arrian. l.</HI> i. <HI>c.</HI> 12. &amp; <HI>l.</HI> ii. <HI>c.</HI> 22. See al&s;o the Characteri&s;tics, vol. 1. from p. 313, to p. 321. where this <HI>Stoical</HI> doctrine is embelli&s;hed with all the eloquence and graces of <HI>Plato.</HI></P></NOTE></L>

The mo&s;t important circum&s;tance of this definition is laid down in the lines referr'd to; but others more minute we &s;hall &s;ubjoin here. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s account of the matter &s;eems both imperfect and fal&s;e; <Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, &s;ays he, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">:  <HI>the ridiculous is &s;ome certain fault or turpi|tude without pain, and not de&s;tructive to its &s;ubject.</HI> <BIBL>(<HI>Poetic. c.</HI> v.)</BIBL></Q> For allow|ing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompany'd with pain, yet we might produce many in&s;tances of &s;uch a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous. So that the definition does not di&s;tingui&s;h the thing defined. Nay farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the de&s;truction of its &s;ubject, we may &s;till be &s;en&s;ible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent and the keener &s;en&s;ations of pity or terror bani&s;h the ludicrous apprehen&s;ion from our minds. For the &s;en&s;ation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or di&s;agreement of ideas; but a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion of the mind con&s;equential to that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or di&s;agreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, becau&s;e it is engro&s;&s;ed by a more violent emotion. Thus it hap|pens that &s;ome men think tho&s;e objects ridiculous, to which others cannot endure to apply the name; becau&s;e in them they excite a much inten&s;er and more im|portant feeling. And this difference, among other cau&s;es, has brought a good deal of confu&s;ion into this que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>That which makes objects ridiculous is &s;ome ground of admiration or e&s;teem connected with other more general circum&s;tances, comparatively worthle&s;s or de|formed; or it is &s;ome circum&s;tance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful: the incon&s;i&s;tent properties exi&s;ting either in the objects them&s;elves, or in the apprehen&s;ion of the per&s;on to whom they relate; belonging always to the &s;ame order or cla&s;s of being, implying &s;entiment or de&s;ign; and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart.</HI></P>
<P>To prove the &s;everal parts of this definition: <HI>The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively &s;ordid or deformed,</HI> is ri|diculous; for in&s;tance, pompous preten&s;ions to wi&s;dom join'd with ignorance and folly in the <HI>Socrates</HI> of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI>; and the applau&s;e of military glory with cowardice and &s;tupidity in the <HI>Thra&s;o</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable,</HI> is al&s;o ridiculous: for in&s;tance, the per&s;onal weakne&s;&s;es of a magi&s;trate appearing in the &s;olemn and public functions of his &s;tation.</P>
<P><HI>The incongruous properties may either exi&s;t in the objects them&s;elves, or in the apprehen&s;ion of the per&s;on to whom they relate:</HI> in the la&s;t-mention'd in&s;tances they both exi&s;t in the objects; in the in&s;tance from <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> one of them is objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehen&s;ion of the ridiculous character.</P>
<P><HI>The incon&s;i&s;tent properties mu&s;t belong to the &s;ame order or cla&s;s of being.</HI> A coxcomb in fine cloaths bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object; becau&s;e his general apprehen&s;ion of excellence and e&s;teem is referr'd to the &s;plendour and expence of his dre&s;s. A man of &s;en&s;e and merit in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, is not counted ridiculous; becau&s;e the general ground of excellence and e&s;teem in him, is, both in fact and in his own apprehen&s;ion, of a very different &s;pecies.</P>
<P><HI>Every ridiculous object implies &s;entiment or de&s;ign.</HI> A column placed by an architect without a capital or ba&s;e, is laugh'd at: the &s;ame column in a ruin cau&s;es a very different &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, <HI>the occurrence mu&s;t excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart,</HI> &s;uch as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that ca&s;e, as was ob&s;erv'd above, the mind is not at lei&s;ure to contemplate the ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this de&s;cription, and whether it comprehend every &s;pecies and form of the ridiculous, mu&s;t be deter|mined by repeated applications of it to particular in&s;tances.</P></NOTE></L>

Ridicule is not concerned with meer &s;peculative truth or fal&s;ehood. It is not in ab&s;tract propo&s;itions or theorems, but in actions and pa&s;&s;ions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find mate|rials for it; and all the&s;e terms are <HI>relative,</HI> implying approbation or blame. To a&s;k then <HI>whether ridicule be a te&s;t of truth,</HI> is, in other words, to a&s;k whether that which is ridiculous can be <HI>morally true,</HI> can be ju&s;t and becoming; or whether that which is ju&s;t and becoming, can be ridiculous. A que&s;tion that does not de&s;erve a &s;erious an&s;wer. For it is mo&s;t evident, that as in a metaphy&s;ical pro|po&s;ition offer'd to the under&s;tanding for its a&s;&s;ent, the faculty of rea&s;on exa|mines the terms of the propo&s;ition, and finding one idea which was &s;uppo&s;ed equal to another, to be in fact unequal, of con&s;equence rejects the propo&s;ition as a fal&s;ehood: &s;o in objects offer'd to the mind for its e&s;teem or applau&s;e, the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we ob&s;erve &s;uch a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the incon&s;i&s;tent circum&s;tances carefully concealed from the eye of public, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s, if the matter be of importance to &s;ociety, to drag out tho&s;e latent circum&s;tances, and by &s;etting them full in view, convince the world how ridiculous the claim is; and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the <HI>moral fal&s;ehood</HI> &s;ooner than in the way of &s;peculative inquiry, and impre&s;s the minds of men with a &s;tronger &s;en&s;e of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, the practice is dangerous, and may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the re|gard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I an&s;wer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous; men may be di&s;hone&s;t in obtruding circum&s;tances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing tho&s;e circum&s;tances to impo&s;e upon us; but the &s;en&s;e of ridicule always judges right: the <HI>Socrates</HI> of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> is as <HI>truly</HI> ridiculous a character as ever was drawn.&mdash;True; but it is not the character of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the divine morali&s;t and father of ancient wi&s;dom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philo&s;opher from detecting and di&s;claiming tho&s;e foreign circum&s;tances which he had fal&s;ely introduced into his character, and thus rendering the &s;atiri&s;t doubly ridiculous in his turn? No: but it neverthele&s;s had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And &s;o has the rea&s;oning of <HI>Spinoza</HI> made many athei&s;ts; he has founded it indeed on &s;uppo&s;itions utterly fal&s;e, but allow him the&s;e, and his con|clu&s;ions are unavoidably true. And if we mu&s;t reject the u&s;e of ridicule, be|cau&s;e by the impo&s;ition of fal&s;e circum&s;tances, things may be made to &s;eem ridiculous, which are not &s;o in them&s;elves; why we ought not in the &s;ame manner to reject the u&s;e of rea&s;on, becau&s;e by proceeding on fal&s;e principles, conclu&s;ions will appear true which are impo&s;&s;ible in nature, let the vehement and ob&s;tinate declaimers again&s;t ridicule determine.</P></NOTE> th' almighty &s;ire</L>
