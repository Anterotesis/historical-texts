<HEAD>SERMON I. THE PROGRESS OF VICE: THE FIRST STAGE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JEREM. ix. 3.</BIBL>
 They proceed from evil to evil.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a maxim confirmed by the experi|ence of ages, That few become abandoned to vice all at once. If they who have be|come mo&s;t profligate, had fore&s;een, at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, the full extent of that de|pravity and guilt under which they now &s;it down without concern or remor&s;e, they would have &s;ickened at the pro&s;pect, and &s;hrunk back with horror and dete&s;tation. Sin is of an in&s;inuating, deceitful, encroaching nature. It is with rea&s;on that the Scriptures &s;o often repre&s;ent it as a <HI>departing from God.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;tep carries us but a little from the right road; every &s;tep removes us a little farther from it; at length the di&s;tance becomes immen&s;e, and
<PB N="2" REF="8">
we know not how to return. <HI>They proceed from evil to evil,</HI> is not a de&s;cription only of one nation peculiarly degenerate: it is appli|cable to every vicious per&s;on. <HI>Evil men</HI> always <HI>wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 13.</NOTE>. Whoever engages in any &s;inful cour&s;e, will find it difficult not to go forward; and &s;till more difficult the farther he has gone. A man of an ingenuous mind cannot think of committing the &s;malle&s;t &s;in without reluctance; by forcing him&s;elf to commit it, he learns to repeat it with le&s;s re|luctance; &s;oon after he takes plea&s;ure in it; in con&s;equence of this he commits it often; by being often committed, it becomes habitual, and depraves the whole temper of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>IN order to put you on your guard again&s;t the deceitful in&s;inuations and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive en|croachments of vice, I propo&s;e to trace out the ordinary &s;teps of the &s;inner's progre&s;s <HI>from evil to evil.</HI> However numerous they are, they may be naturally reduced to three general &s;tages.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> comprehends tho&s;e &s;teps of men|tal indulgence by which irregular inclinations and vicious pa&s;&s;ions are inwardly cheri&s;hed, till they break forth into overt acts of &s;in:</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">THE <HI>&s;econd,</HI> tho&s;e &s;teps by which, in con&s;e|quence of wilful &s;in, vicious habits are con|tracted, &s;trengthened, and multiplied:</P>
<P>THE <HI>third,</HI> the confirmation of the cor|rupted heart in profligate wickedne&s;s and en|mity again&s;t religion.</P>
<P>THE P&s;almi&s;t points at a very &s;imilar di&s;|tribution. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the &s;corn|ful</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. i. 1.</NOTE>. Three gradations of vice are di&s;tinctly marked. At fir&s;t a man <HI>walks</HI> in it, indulges him&s;elf only in tran&s;ient acts: next he <HI>&s;tands</HI> in it, his wickedne&s;s is habitual: at la&s;t he be|comes &s;o inflexible and obdurate, that he <HI>&s;its</HI> down &s;atisfied in his degeneracy. At fir&s;t, he is occa&s;ionally &s;educed by li&s;tening to <HI>the coun|&s;el</HI> of the vicious, by corrupting communica|tion, or by &s;ome &s;trong temptation: then he &s;pontaneou&s;ly takes the &s;ame <HI>way</HI> with them, and cu&s;tomarily conforms to their evil prac|tices: and at length he is not only confirmed in his own wickedne&s;s, but becomes one of the <HI>&s;cornful,</HI> ridicules virtue and religion, and la|bours to corrupt tho&s;e who have not yet abandoned them. The body of &s;in has its
<PB N="4" REF="10">
periods of growth, analogous to tho&s;e of man's natural life. In its infancy, it is kept alive and cheri&s;hed by favourable circum|&s;tances; its &s;trength is incon&s;iderable; it may ea&s;ily be re&s;trained or de&s;troyed. In its youth it becomes robu&s;t and ungovernable; it can &s;upport it&s;elf; it is impetuous, un|controulable, and violent in all its exertions. When it has reached maturity, its con&s;titution is fixt, its operations determined, its force irre&s;i&s;tible, and it arrogates authority to tutor men in wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Each of the three &s;tages into which we have di&s;tingui&s;hed the pro|gre&s;s of vice, will furni&s;h ample matter for a &s;eparate di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of them &s;hall be our pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject. It includes that train of mental indul|gences, by which irregular inclinations and vi|cious pa&s;&s;ions are inwardly cheri&s;hed, till they break forth into overt acts of wilful tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. <HI>When lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth &s;in</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 15.</NOTE>. If the de&s;ire of a forbidden object, or the de&s;ire of obtaining any object by unlaw|ful means, be not checked as &s;oon as it be|gins to ri&s;e, it becomes the embryo of vice, and grows and ripens into open wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">TOO often, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, its growth is extremely quick; it is conceived, formed, and born almo&s;t in the &s;ame hour. Many have never been taught to attend to the difference between right and wrong: they are regardle&s;s of it, and care little how they act. Their pa&s;&s;ions have been &s;eldom curbed; and have become &s;o violent by the time they are capable of vice, that they hurry them into one &s;in after another, ju&s;t as they find an op|portunity of committing it. But &s;uch as have received a virtuous and pious education, are generally for &s;ome time mode&s;t and harmle&s;s, &s;hocked with the ba&s;ene&s;s of vice, and afraid to venture on it. Their faults are chiefly tho&s;e of ignorance, or infirmity, or inadvertence. The&s;e &s;eldom throw off the impre&s;&s;ions of their education all at once; often they efface them by &s;low and painful touches.</P>
<P>YOUNG per&s;ons are gradually introduced into the world. Temptations meet them, and obtrude them&s;elves upon them. The good things of this world, naturally, and in them|&s;elves innocently de&s;ireable, appear in &s;ituations in which they cannot reach them but by un|lawful means: evils to which they are nece&s;|&s;arily aver&s;e, are &s;o placed that they cannot avoid them without &s;in. In the &s;implicity of his heart, the youth <HI>pa&s;&s;eth through the &s;treet,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<HI>near the corner</HI> where vice hath her abode; un|knowing, un&s;u&s;picious, <HI>he goeth the way to her hou&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. vii. 8.</NOTE>. The &s;orcere&s;s ca&s;ts her&s;elf in his way: &s;he puts on her mo&s;t dazzling attire; &s;he co|vers her face with &s;miles; &s;he confidently promi&s;es him ea&s;e, plea&s;ure, riches, or enjoy|ment; &s;he importunately urges him to ta&s;te her delights, and to &s;hare her trea&s;ures. More fortunate, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, than the <HI>young man void of under&s;tanding,</HI> whom Solomon <HI>di&s;|cerned among the youths</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE>, he re&s;i&s;ts her attacks. It is much if he does. But, to give you the more alarming view of the multiplied dangers of corruption to which the be&s;t guarded in|nocence is obnoxious, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e that, after the temptation, he continues as aver&s;e to vice as before: let him be even more careful to &s;hun the like occa&s;ions of hazard to his virtue.</P>
<P>BUT, in this &s;tate of probation, the greate&s;t care cannot prevent our falling into tempta|tion, almo&s;t every day. He again finds him|&s;elf in circum&s;tances which invite him, perhaps more urgently, to the &s;ame or to &s;ome other vice. He retreats not with &s;ufficient &s;peed: he guards not his heart with &s;ufficient diligence. Elated with hs former victory, he is confident
<PB N="7" REF="13">
of his own re&s;olution. He apprehends no great difficulty in repelling this temptation likewi&s;e; he has little dread of falling before it; he becomes &s;ecure and negligent. His &s;e|curity, it is highly probable, will quickly be|tray him into &s;in. With the be&s;t intention of firm attachment to his Lord, with full confi|dence that he never would <HI>be offended becau&s;e of him, that though he &s;hould die with him, he would not deny him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">3 35.</NOTE>, Peter followed Je&s;us into the judgment-hall: but there he was unexpectedly a&s;&s;aulted by a temptation to deny him, and he was in&s;tantly overpowered by it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. 70.</NOTE>. Un|dervaluing an enemy, has often occa&s;ioned a defeat. If you become in&s;en&s;ible of the power of temptation, you are lo&s;t. It is only by keeping at as great a di&s;tance from it as po&s;|&s;ible, and by reckoning every temptation for|midable to human weakne&s;s, that you can be &s;afe.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e your &s;en&s;e of duty &s;o &s;trong, as to re&s;train you, though negligent, from full compliance, from overt acts of &s;in; yet when|ever the natural object of a pa&s;&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf in a &s;ituation in which it cannot be lawfully pur&s;ued, it has a plain tendency to excite the de&s;ire of obtaining it by unlawful
<PB N="8" REF="14">
means; and it has the &s;tronger tendency, the oftener it pre&s;ents it&s;elf. The very fir&s;t mo|tion of de&s;ire, which it nece&s;&s;arily produces, is a &s;eed, not yet fully &s;haped and organized, but fit to expand it&s;elf quickly into &s;in. The de&s;ire&punc; however faint, will &s;oon gain &s;trength, if it be not immediately and re&s;olutely cru&s;hed. The lea&s;t voluntary indulgence, though but in thought, will nouri&s;h it. But when the object of an unlawful pa&s;&s;ion is often in our view, and in our power, it is very difficult to ab&s;tain from all indulgence &s;o much as in thought. It is natural for a man to think of the temptation to which he was expo&s;ed, and the &s;in to which it urged him: and though at fir&s;t he think of it with aver&s;ion, there is dan|ger that he will come in time to regard it with more favourable &s;entiments. Before he is aware, imagination paints the object of vici|ous pa&s;&s;ion in attractive colours. Embelli&s;hed by its pencil, &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures &s;mile, riches glitter, honours glow. He deliberately fixes his eye upon them; he begins to contemplate them with complacence and delight. To revel in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;eems to be enjoyment; to abound in wealth, appears to be magnifi|cence; to bring harm on his enemies, he thinks, would be a triumph. He gives a wel|come entertainment to the evil motions of his heart.&mdash;Happy is who then takes the alarm,
<PB N="9" REF="15">
and flecs while yet he has it in his power to flee! This is &s;omething more than the fir&s;t motion and nece&s;&s;ary propen&s;ion of the heart. The&s;e imaginations are evil, and they give form and animation to the embryo of vice. If they be indulged, they will render the pa&s;|&s;ions irregular and turbulent. You will find an inclination ri&s;ing to gratify them, though it be unlawful. You will regret that it is un|lawful. You have a painfulne&s;s, an eagerne&s;s, an impatience of de&s;ire, which you never knew before. You pant for the plea&s;ure or the profit which would attend the &s;in; you wi&s;h to commit it for the &s;ake of them. Al|ready <HI>thine heart</HI> hath <HI>declined to the ways</HI> of &s;in, <HI>devi&s;ing wicked imaginations;</HI> you want but a fit occa&s;ion of <HI>going a&s;tray in her paths</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 18. vii. 25.</NOTE>. Already your will has con&s;ented to the perpe|tration of iniquity: and by that con&s;ent your &s;oul is polluted, and guilt contracted. Sin is conceived, it is perfected within; it only waits opportunity to be brought forth into act. Often men have &s;o far indulged their pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;o entirely con&s;ented in their hearts to &s;in, that their not committing it is in no mea|&s;ure owing to their virtue, but &s;olely to the kindne&s;s of Providence in with-holding oppor|tunity. If they ab&s;tain from it, when they
<PB N="10" REF="16">
have a favourable opportunity, it mu&s;t be by a &s;truggle between pampered pa&s;&s;ion and the &s;en&s;e of duty, harder, more determined, and more laborious, than the weakne&s;s of human virtue can generally &s;u&s;tain. By inwardly indulging vicious pa&s;&s;ions for a while, vice be|comes familiar to our thoughts; the horror of it wears off; all the principles of re&s;traint are enfeebled. They have rai&s;ed a tumult in the &s;oul, amid&s;t which the &s;till voice of con&s;cience cannot be heard; they have kindled a flame which all the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on cannot extingui&s;h; a violent eruption can &s;carcely be prevented. It is by timeou&s;ly refu&s;ing all occa&s;ions of in|dulging them, by ob&s;tinately denying them their food, by withdrawing every incentive to them from the very fir&s;t, that you can, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, hinder their grow|ing into &s;uch force, and hurrying you on irre&s;i&s;tibly to fulfil their dictates.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, however, your &s;en&s;e of virtue &s;o &s;trong, as &s;till to re&s;train you from the full commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;in. Pa&s;&s;ion will pretend, that it will be &s;atisfied with &s;ome degree of indulgence, &s;hort of complete gratification. It is become too powerful not to be per&s;ua|&s;ive. Forgetful that, between di&s;ordered pa&s;|&s;ion, and virtue, no accommodation can take place, you are di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;ome conce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="17">
to your pa&s;&s;ions, but with a firm re&s;olu|tion not to go the length of an overt act of &s;in. You will not allow the love of money to carry you to di&s;hone&s;ty, but you will yield to it &s;o far as to avail your&s;elves of a little ad|dre&s;s. You will not &s;uffer malice or re&s;ent|ment to tran&s;port you into injury, but you will &s;oothe them by treating your enemy as hardly as ju&s;tice can permit. You will not be &s;ub&s;ervient to the vices of the man who&s;e fa|vour you court, but you will not be &s;o nice as not to flatter him in them. You will not &s;ink your&s;elf into drunkenne&s;s, but you will give way to a continuation of exhilarating draughts. You will ab&s;tain from deeds of uncleanne&s;s, but you will not deny your&s;elf the plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from words or actions of &s;light la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s. You will never enter within the territories of vice, but you will indulge your&s;elf in approaching to them. You will not tran&s;gre&s;s the limits of innocence, but you will venture as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;er|vation of your innocence. By &s;uch a conce&s;|&s;ion, you flatter your&s;elf, the importunity of your pa&s;&s;ions will be diverted; the unea&s;ine&s;s which they give you, removed; and your in|clination to the &s;ins which they demand, weak|ened. Delu&s;ive is the expectation! Vice has gained the victory, if &s;he once per&s;uades men to make any approach to her. There is no
<PB N="12" REF="18">
&s;ecurity but in keeping at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from her. <HI>Enter not into her path, go not in her way; avoid it, pa&s;s not by it; turn from it, and pa&s;s away</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 14, 15.</NOTE>. <HI>Avoid all appearance of evil</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. v. 22.</NOTE>.&mdash;Is it certain that the very indulgence which you propo&s;e to give your&s;elves, is perfectly lawful? It is not always ea&s;y to fix the pre|ci&s;e boundary between virtue and vice. They run in&s;en&s;ibly into one another, like day and night. You cannot di&s;cern the very point at which the one ends, and the other begins. By re&s;olving to proceed to the extreme&s;t line of innocence, a thou&s;and to one but you &s;lide into real vice. <HI>The law</HI> of God <HI>is &s;piritual</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 14.</NOTE>, and <HI>his word is very pure</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxix. 140.</NOTE>. What men call ju&s;ti|fiable liberties, he often abhors as gro&s;s &s;ins.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e the indulgence not ab&s;olutely un|lawful. Yet to venture on it, is only to give new force to your temptations, and to encrea&s;e the danger of your &s;ituation. It is as if the governour of a fortre&s;s, in&s;tead of maintaining his po&s;t, &s;hould lead out a &s;mall garri&s;on to encounter a great army in the open field. It is the &s;trength which pa&s;&s;ion has already ac|quired by your indulging evil imaginations, that enables it to produce an inclination to make any approach to &s;in; and that approach will bring it &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength as
<PB N="13" REF="19">
to produce a much more violent propen&s;ity to the completion of the crime. Every &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, every inflamed appetite, engro&s;&s;es the &s;oul, and unfits it for the reflection and exer|tion by which it might be re&s;trained; and every advance in the gratification of it, pro|portionably augments its influence, and ener|vates all the powers of re&s;i&s;tance. Indulgence in whatever has the remote&s;t tendency to vice, never fails to invigorate the vicious pa&s;&s;ion. Thus humoured, thus gratified, it domineers; it craves with irre&s;i&s;tible importunity; it com|bats the &s;en&s;e of duty; it di&s;dains controul; it &s;ubverts every re&s;olution of retaining our in|tegrity; it occa&s;ions in&s;upportable unea&s;ine&s;s in forbearing the &s;in by which its demands would be fulfilled. A &s;trong fortification may with&s;tand a great force; but if a very &s;mall de|tachment gain an entrance, they can introduce the whole with ea&s;e. Stand remote from vice, and you may be &s;afe: but go within its reach, and you will be drawn forward as by the &s;uc|tion of a whirlpool. He who has allowed him&s;elf in rigorous exaction, will become le&s;s &s;crupulous of extortion.

The oftener a man has repeated his draughts, the more de&s;irous

David e&s;pied Bath&s;heba by accident; he indulged his ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion but &s;o far as to gaze upon her: it was inflamed; it gave him no re&s;t, till it plunged him into adultery. A narrow foun|tain &s;ends forth a copious &s;tream; an incon|&s;iderable &s;eed grows up into a &s;tately cedar; any vicious pa&s;&s;ion, a little indulged, will bur&s;t into heinous &s;in. If ever you find your|&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to compound with pa&s;&s;ion, re|collect your&s;elves, and retreat without delay; you are on the point of &s;acrificing your inno|cence. <HI>Can a man take fire in his bo&s;om, and his clothes not be burnt?

<P>IF all the indulgence which you have given to your vicious pa&s;&s;ions has not &s;o far cor|rupted your hearts as to efface your abhor|rence of a great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, it cannot fail to have at lea&s;t impaired your &s;en&s;e of obliga|tion, and your inclination to comply with the calls of duty.

The neglect pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily upon them: it is not the violation of a moral law; and &s;ome latitude, and many limitations, mu&s;t be admitted in the ob&s;ervance of ceremonial pre|cepts. But experience te&s;tifies that, when they who once were regular have become remi&s;s in outward wor&s;hip, they rarely fail to pa&s;s with rapidity into direct immorality: and rea&s;on declares that it &s;carcely can be otherwi&s;e.

Where has he intimated favour to the per&s;on who, by flattering him&s;elf with forgivene&s;s in what he knows to be wrong, adds pre&s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s to his di&s;obedience? Under this impious delu&s;ion, you may go on in &s;in with tranquillity; but it is to certain de|&s;truction.&mdash;But though it is unlawful in it|&s;elf, your &s;ituation is &s;o peculiar as to ju&s;tify it: your temptations are &s;o &s;trong that it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t them.

Attend to the inmo&s;t motions of your hearts; ob&s;erve the thoughts which attempt to ri&s;e within you; if they be evil, exclude them, or bani&s;h them without delay; &s;uffer them not to dwell on any unlawful or &s;educing object; accu&s;tom them to fix only on what is good or improv|ing. Keep a jealous eye over all the workings of imagination; turn it away from whatever can encourage vicious pa&s;&s;ions; force it to &s;uch views as are fit to check their growth. Watch over all your inclinations, pa&s;&s;ions, and affec|tions; confine them to their proper objects; let them never &s;well into exce&s;s. Allow not the mo&s;t hidden purpo&s;e or de&s;ign of &s;in to find

a moment's entertainment in your &s;ouls; for|tify them by &s;uch re&s;olutions as are virtuous.

<P>CONTENT not your&s;elves with endeavouring to re&s;train your pa&s;&s;ions from breaking out into vicious practice, while you indulge them inwardly. It is far from &s;ufficient, to regu|late your external conduct. This was the corrupt doctrine of the Jewi&s;h teachers. <HI>But ye have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 20.</NOTE>; to this wicked doctrine he &s;et him&s;elf in the mo&s;t zealous oppo&s;ition.

If thou in thy heart con|&s;ente&s;t to thoughts or de&s;igns of &s;in, thou art truly guilty, though no trace of them were vi&s;ible in thy behaviour. The lu&s;ts of the heart are like ulcers, which, without a &s;peedy extirpation, will fe&s;ter and become incurable, though they lie &s;o deep, and are &s;o well con|cealed by decency of conduct, as not to be

No labour will dry up the &s;treams, if we cannot drain the fountain-head.

 They proceed from evil to evil.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF the general of an army were informed, that the enemy intended to attack him, his fir&s;t care would naturally be, to get intelli|gence of his motions, of his pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, of the part on which he expected to make an impre&s;&s;ion, of the &s;tratagems which he would employ for facilitating the execution of his de&s;ign; and the more perfectly he learned the&s;e particulars, the better he would be prepared to repel him. Our condition in this world is &s;imilar; and our conduct ought to be the &s;ame. We are every moment in danger of being a&s;&s;aulted and vanqui&s;hed by &s;in. Its power is great, its deceitfulne&s;s is greater. It gains upon us by gradual, often
<PB N="34" REF="40">
by imperceptible &s;teps; and for every &s;tep, it makes the mo&s;t artful preparations. To be acquainted with the&s;e, is to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure qualified for defeating it. I have therefore propo&s;ed to trace out the progre&s;s of vice, to explain the manner in which men, having given the &s;malle&s;t indulgence to &s;inful thoughts and inclinations, <HI>proceed from evil to evil.</HI> In the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, I have de&s;cribed the FIRST of the three &s;tages into which that pro|gre&s;s may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by laying open the train of mental indulgences by which irregular inclinations and vicious pa&s;&s;ions are inwardly cheri&s;hed, till they break forth into overt acts of &s;in. In this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall endeavour to delineate the SECOND &s;tage, which comprehends the &s;teps whereby, in con&s;equence of wilful &s;in, vicious habits are contracted, &s;trengthened, and multiplied.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner has a per&s;on, unaccu&s;tomed to vice, committed an act of wilful &s;in, than he is di&s;&s;atisfied with him&s;elf, and purpo&s;es and promi&s;es not to repeat it. The fear of its being known, or the &s;hame of detection, the re|proaches or the admonitions of virtuous friends, heighten his emotions, aggravate his remor&s;e, and enforce his purpo&s;es. He is &s;u&s;|picious of his own frailty, attentive to his conduct, and &s;olicitous to re&s;train the pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="35" REF="41">
which had led him a&s;tray. He hopes that con&s;cience has re-a&s;&s;umed its &s;way, and that he is recovered to virtue. But after a while, pa&s;&s;ion begins to rai&s;e its voice, and to exert its &s;trength. It has once been gratified, and by that gratification, both its importunity and its power have been increa&s;ed. Tempta|tions pre&s;s upon him, and plead for the indul|gence of his pa&s;&s;ions. Alternately he is di&s;|po&s;ed to proceed in vice, and to return to virtue: his mind fluctuates irre&s;olute between the two; it is di&s;tracted by contrary motions; it is worn out with painful agitation; it again yields to the violence of pa&s;&s;ion. Very &s;eldom does a man acquie&s;ce in a &s;olitary act of &s;in: having committed one crime, many cau&s;es concur in producing a repetition of it. By once violating innocence, you break down the &s;tronge&s;t barrier again&s;t vice. By having been once indulged, your vicious inclinations be|come more refractory and unconquerable. At the &s;ame time, all tho&s;e principles of your na|ture, which ought to combat them, are reduced to act with le&s;s confidence and vigour. The reluctance which ri&s;es &s;trong again&s;t a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion that you have never ventured to com|mit, cannot ri&s;e in equal &s;trength again&s;t one on which you have already ventured. You have already ca&s;t off allegiance to con&s;cience, and determined that ab&s;olute &s;ubjection to its
<PB N="36" REF="42">
commands is not indi&s;pen&s;ible. You have al|ready di&s;claimed its authority, and with&s;tood its power. Having once di&s;obeyed its dic|tates, how &s;hould you hold them &s;acred now? Having once forced it to bow its head under the u&s;urpation of lawle&s;s lu&s;ts, how can it be able to throw off the yoke, when their u&s;ur|pation is in &s;ome degree e&s;tabli&s;hed? The rea|&s;ons which you could have urged again&s;t the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, you can never urge with equal force again&s;t any &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion: they have been already de&s;pi&s;ed and con|tradicted. If from the former tre&s;pa&s;s you have found no immediate inconvenience ari&s;e, if you have even derived profit or plea&s;ure from it, this will encourage you to the repe|tition of it, and will be accepted as a confuta|tion of all the arguments for ab&s;tinence. Every ill example, every &s;educing maxim, every in&s;i|nuation of &s;elf-deceit, will operate more &s;uc|ce&s;sfully than before. To &s;in a &s;econd time, you need not put a force upon your&s;elves; you are prone to it, you feel little unea&s;ine&s;s in the thought of it. You &s;eek no other rea&s;on for doing wrong, but that you have already done it. When temptation has found forward allies in your pa&s;&s;ions, has bribed your principles to admit its claim in &s;ilence, and has warped your rea&s;on to chicane in &s;upport of it, you cannot be able to with&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="43">THE repetition of the &s;in, it may be, oc|ca&s;ions a return of regret, &s;elf-condemnation, &s;hame, and virtuous purpo&s;es. But they are feebler and more ineffectual than before. A &s;hort interval of time, or the recurrence of temptation, totally effaces them. Your vicious inclinations were &s;trengthened by being in|dulged: by the re&s;traint which you have &s;ince endeavoured to lay upon them, they are only irritated; they ri&s;e ungovernable, and ru&s;h impetuous into vice, like a lion on his prey. Your hopeful purpo&s;es &s;hrink and faint before them. The flame which had been &s;mothered for a while, breaks forth with greater fury. You ca&s;t away your virtue, as if you had never formed a de&s;ign of retaining it. One hour you are propen&s;e to vice, and the next hour unea&s;y in the recollection of it. When you are expo&s;ed to no temptation, you &s;eem to be reformed; but whenever a temptation a&s;|&s;aults you, you relap&s;e. Every time it defeats you with greater ea&s;e; your efforts to re&s;i&s;t it, are weaker; your inclination to comply with it, more eager; your con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having complied, le&s;s painful. Your vicious actions become every day more frequent; the lea&s;t temptation is too &s;trong for you. Your vici|ous inclinations are more con&s;tantly heard and gratified; they drive you on &s;o furiou&s;ly, that
<PB N="38" REF="44">
you are again and again plunged into guilt, you &s;carcely know how.</P>
<P>BY frequent practice, habits of vice mu&s;t needs be formed. Great is the power of cu&s;|tom over the &s;oul of man. When we attempt an action which we have never attempted for|merly, we find it difficult; but by performing it often, we learn to perform it ea&s;ily. We likewi&s;e become prone to it; the pa&s;&s;ion which tends to that action, keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and operates almo&s;t without intermi&s;|&s;ion. It con&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ts images and &s;enti|ments fit to increa&s;e its &s;trength, and a&s;&s;i&s;t its operation. We are in pain when we cannot exert it; to act upon it, is a plea&s;ure. For things mo&s;t di&s;agreeable in them&s;elves, cu&s;tom creates a reli&s;h. By practice, therefore, the heart mu&s;t become not only pliable, but bent to &s;in; and acquire fir&s;t a facility, and next a plea&s;ure in committing it. A very few acts will give a beginning to vicious habit; and as &s;oon as it has begun to be formed, it will ren|der our vicious actions very frequent. Every action is recommended by the &s;ame tempta|tion as the fir&s;t; and to its influence, the power of cu&s;tom is &s;uperadded. For exertion again&s;t their combined force, you cannot in|culcate any motive which you have not already baffled. <HI>If thou ha&s;t run with the footmen, and</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="45">
<HI>they have wearied thee, how then can&s;t thou contend with hor&s;es</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xii. 5.</NOTE>? The crime which you once hazarded with he&s;itation and re|&s;erve, you will now perpetrate boldly, and embrace with complacency. Your conduct is no longer &s;tained by &s;ome tran&s;ient mi&s;|deeds; it is contaminated in its general tenour. Formerly you only fell before a &s;trong temptation; but now the &s;lendere&s;t temptation is irre&s;i&s;tible; you will not even wait for a temptation from without, there is a per|manent temptation within your own brea&s;ts. You will not now run into one &s;in, and then regret it; but you will ha&s;ten through a train of vicious conduct, and then awake to a cour&s;e of &s;orrow, remor&s;e, and &s;elf-reproach. The period of the former will become conti|nually more extended and more flagitious; and that of the latter, &s;horter and le&s;s agonizing.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame con&s;truction of the human &s;oul, which fits us for contracting habits, renders it unavoidable, that every habit which we have contracted &s;hould continually increa&s;e in &s;trength&punc; It forces us to act upon it; and by being acted upon, it is confirmed. A vicious habit needs only to be planted: as naturally as a tree flouri&s;hes in its proper &s;oil, it will
<PB N="40" REF="46">
quickly advance to a prodigious &s;ize. From each of the many indulgences to which it daily compels you, it will draw abundant nouri&s;h|ment. Actuated by habit, you will commit &s;in with growing plea&s;ure; you will become expert in committing it, and more and more intent upon it. When a twig is bent at fir&s;t, it will by its own ela&s;ticity recover its recti|tude as &s;oon as the force is removed; but by continuing to bend it long, you may fix it in a curvature which can &s;carcely be corrected. Vicious habit will by degrees become &s;o &s;tub|born as to baffle all ordinary efforts to extir|pate it. It de&s;troys &s;elf-government; it puts the pa&s;&s;ions in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;trong holds of the heart; you will find it difficult either to di&s;lodge them, or to check their eruptions. The pain that attends your endeavours to for|bear gratifying inclinations which have become habitual, adds much to the &s;eeming value of the gratification: and the &s;en&s;e of that pain, together with the perver&s;e tendency of your own heart, will render your pur&s;uit of it keener, than in proportion to your mo&s;t extra|vagant idea of its value. You no longer need the view of profit or of plea&s;ure to entice you to a &s;inful action: you have acquired a fixt at|tachment to it, you run into it of cour&s;e, without reflecting on any preci&s;e motive, or propo&s;ing any determinate con&s;equences. Even
<PB N="41" REF="47">
the experience of ill con&s;equences proceeding from it, is in&s;ufficient to prevent your &s;oon re|turning to the commi&s;&s;ion of it. The drunkard whom Solomon de&s;cribes, who had drowned &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, on awaking to the exerci&s;e of them, found him&s;elf brui&s;ed and wounded, he knew not how, and complained bitterly, <HI>they have &s;tricken me, and I was not &s;ick, they have beaten me, and I felt it not:</HI> neverthe|le&s;s he immediately &s;aid, <HI>I will &s;eek it yet again</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 35.</NOTE>. The whoremonger, the thief, the robber, the oppre&s;&s;or, the mi&s;er, the malicious, the &s;inner of every denomination, meets with many &s;evere checks and cha&s;ti&s;ements in the pro&s;ecution of his vice, by which he notwith|&s;tanding cannot be reclaimed. Habit nece&s;&s;a|rily engenders thoughtle&s;lne&s;s: actions to which we are habituated, we do often every day, without either being con&s;cious of it at the time, or recollecting it afterwards. Vicious habit extingui&s;hes reflection. The voice of con&s;cience is heard &s;eldomer and more faintly. Its languid oppo&s;ition is &s;o far from repre&s;&s;ing the irregularity of pa&s;&s;ion, or vanqui&s;hing the propen&s;ity of habit, that it increa&s;es their &s;trength. To overcome it, they collect and exert their utmo&s;t force; and having quickly overcome it, they will go on with the &s;ame
<PB N="42" REF="48">
accumulated force, driving you headlong into &s;in. By the long and cu&s;tomary practice of any vice, it will become predominant within you: it is dear to you as your <HI>right hand,</HI> or your <HI>right eye</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 29. 30.</NOTE>: you regard it as an intimate part of the con&s;titution of your &s;oul. Your heart is &s;et upon indulging it; you think it impo&s;&s;ible to live without it. What once you &s;hunned as a dangerous temptation, you now court as a de&s;irable opportunity. You are careful to embrace it; and by often finding, and often embracing it, your conduct is ren|dered habitually vicious, at lea&s;t in one parti|cular.</P>
<P>BUT your degeneracy will not be long con|fined to one particular. While from a &s;ingle act, that vice to which your favourite pa&s;&s;ion or your peculiar &s;ituation has fir&s;t betrayed you, is ripening into habit, many other vices will take root, and thrive beneath its &s;helter. Numberle&s;s are the ways in which one &s;in grows out of another.&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ion of any &s;in weakens, the habit of any &s;in de&s;troys, our defence again&s;t every &s;in, and lays us open to it. It inures us to make light of obligation, and prepares us to di&s;obey its dictates without di&s;tinction. It breaks the balance, and un|hinges
<PB N="43" REF="49">
the order of our powers: they can no longer operate on one another as mutual checks. It di&s;&s;olves the &s;oul in anarchy, amid&s;t which, like violence in a country void of government, every irregular pa&s;&s;ion rages unheeded and uncontrouled, and from which it finds occa&s;ions of fulfilling all its plea&s;ure. Whatever be the &s;in, a temptation to which attacks the heart in this &s;tate of di&s;traction, it mu&s;t prevail. There is too much uproar and confu&s;ion within, to admit a &s;trict examina|tion, or a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Every vice pro|duces likewi&s;e peculiar effects favourable to the practice of other vices. Some enervate the &s;oul, and render it effeminate; &s;ome contract or deba&s;e the heart; and &s;ome make it callous and unfeeling.&mdash;By thus debauching the heart from virtue, the practice of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ins will make way for your committing the greate&s;t. Men commonly begin with &s;ome le&s;&s;er acts of vice: there are atrocious crimes, at the thought of which they would yet &s;hud|der. But if a &s;mall &s;in once gain admittance, becau&s;e it is but &s;mall, another will likewi&s;e gain admittance, becau&s;e it is but a little greater; and the &s;ame fooli&s;h deceit will lead you forward, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the mo&s;t enor|mous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. When con&s;cience is defiled, the&s;e will not appear more horrid to it, than the &s;lendere&s;t offence did, when it was fair and
<PB N="44" REF="50">
uncorrupted. When you have brought your|&s;elves to commit any &s;in, you will &s;oon com|mit another more aggravated, with le&s;s unea|&s;ine&s;s. If you &s;uffer any of the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions to vent them&s;elves in expre&s;&s;ions of contempt and &s;light, they will quickly be poured out in bitter reproach and invective, and next proceed to violent contentions, fierce quarrels, and gro&s;s injuries. If you accu&s;tom your&s;elves to the u&s;e of fooli&s;h terms of a&s;&s;e|veration or exclamation in your di&s;cour&s;e, it will gradually reconcile you to &s;wearing vainly by the name of God; after a while the &s;lighte&s;t provocation or impatience will bur&s;t forth into oaths and imprecations; then neither provoca|tion nor impatience will be nece&s;&s;ary; ra&s;hly, for the mere&s;t trifles, without con&s;ideration of the truth or the fal&s;ehood, the moment or the con&s;equences of the matter, you will heap oaths and cur&s;es on one another; and by thoughtle&s;sly multiplying oaths in your ordi|nary conver&s;ation, you will at length come to de&s;pi&s;e them, and venture without much &s;cruple on premeditated perjury, when you have a &s;trong temptation to it.

into any &s;in, by an imagination that it is &s;mall, is to con&s;ent that you &s;hall gradually, but unavoidably, be drawn on to the mo&s;t heinous &s;ins.</P>
<P>IT is not only by its tendency to introduce a general depravation of heart, that one &s;in leads men forward to other &s;ins; it likewi&s;e begets many &s;trong temptations to them. The natural progeny of every vice is numerous. With whatever vice you begin, you will find many others in&s;eparably connected with it.

Lewdne&s;s de&s;troys all regard to decency and re|putation, wears away the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and produces impudence and effrontery in doing and in avowing the mo&s;t flagitious actions.

<P>ONE &s;in will generally demand new &s;ins, in order to conceal it. Evil is a&s;hamed of it&s;elf; it cannot bear to be looked upon. To a no|vice in vice, detection appears in&s;upportable: and often it would have con&s;equences which the greate&s;t proficient in vice trembles at the thought of incurring. What he has done, mu&s;t

be concealed by any means. Di&s;&s;imulation, lying, murder, it may be, is the only means of concealment. It mu&s;t be perpetrated: infamy, puni&s;hment, ruin, cannot be otherwi&s;e avoided. When you have already given up your&s;elves to one vice, it cannot be expected that you &s;hould meet the&s;e, rather than commit ano|ther. When David knew that Bath&s;heba had conceived, he nece&s;&s;arily became anxious to prevent a di&s;covery of his adultery: it could not be prevented without his con&s;enting to &s;ome additional ba&s;ene&s;s; and his anxiety led him into a &s;eries of the blacke&s;t de&s;igns.

The king made another ef|fort to accompli&s;h the impo&s;ition; he wheedled him into drunkenne&s;s, that wine might inflame his pa&s;&s;ion; but the &s;ame delicacy of honour pre&s;erved him from the &s;nare. The horrors of a di&s;covery, and the ju&s;t re&s;entment of an abu&s;ed &s;ervant, &s;tare David in the face; they drive him on to the mo&s;t violent and atrocious methods of averting them; there are no others, and they mu&s;t be adopted: Uriah is perfidi|ou&s;ly &s;acrificed to the &s;word; his courage, his fidelity, and his zeal are employed for his de|&s;truction; many brave men are devoted along

Engaged in vice, you mu&s;t either plunge into all the crimes naturally con&s;equent upon it, or infringe gratitude, friend&s;hip, ho|nour, fidelity, in retreating. Perhaps the real fault lies only in your having reduced your|&s;elves to &s;o perplexing an alternative; and to embrace the only means of retreat, has but the appearance of faultine&s;s. But you will probably think otherwi&s;e: vice commonly pro|duces a perver&s;ion of &s;entiment, and in&s;inuates fal&s;e maxims of honour, by means of which, what an unhappy peculiarity of &s;ituation has rendered right and nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hocks more than what is ab&s;olutely wrong. You will go on, but find no end till you &s;ink into perdi|tion.</P>
<P>ONE indulged vice will always require many others for its &s;upport and execution. Avarice will not long be &s;atisfied with the gratification which penurious &s;avings, or toil|&s;ome
<PB N="50" REF="56">
drudgery, can bring: for feeding it&s;elf, it will &s;oon come to intercept the gift of cha|rity, the retribution of gratitude, the oblation of benevolence, and it will next exact the practice of every di&s;hone&s;t art of making gain. Lu&s;t cannot effectuate its purpo&s;es without often employing deceit, fal&s;ehood, &s;eduction, and inflicting injury the deepe&s;t and the mo&s;t irreparable. The expen&s;ive vices cannot be continued without &s;ubmitting to &s;upply their demands by covetou&s;ne&s;s, inju&s;tice, fraud, or rapine. Every one among you who has, for the &s;horte&s;t time, addicted him&s;elf to any vi|cious cour&s;e, knows, by certain experience, that in pur&s;uing it, he has been forced to commit many other vices. For the&s;e &s;ub&s;idiary vices, you perhaps have no inclination; they are even perfectly abhorrent from your nature; but you mu&s;t either con&s;ent to them, or ab&s;tain from your darling &s;in. Contrary propen&s;ions may for a while &s;truggle within you, and di&s;|tract your &s;oul; you may &s;hudder at the thought of what you mu&s;t do: you may &s;tart back, and again &s;tart back, and wi&s;h and purpo&s;e to leave the deed undone. But the darling &s;in requires it; and it has got firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your heart: rea&s;on, con&s;cience, nature it&s;elf, re&s;i&s;t in vain; that &s;in will at length prevail, and drive you into whatever
<PB N="51" REF="57">
crimes &s;hall become nece&s;&s;ary for accompli&s;h|ing its ends.</P>
<P>BY repeated acts, the &s;everal vices into which your favourite &s;in betrays you, will likewi&s;e become habitual. What you at fir&s;t only endured for the &s;ake of &s;omething el&s;e, you will in time acquire a pronene&s;s to, per|petrate for its own &s;ake, and take delight in perpetrating. Your vice will not only grow inveterate, but al&s;o &s;pread like a gangrene. It will at once &s;trike its roots deeper, and extend its branches wider. What was in the begin|ning like a handful of &s;mall &s;eeds, grows at la&s;t into a fore&s;t of lofty cedars. Your &s;ouls are overrun with vicious habits, continually increa&s;ing in &s;trength and number, and fixing you in all manner of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE vice is thus ri&s;ing to maturity, by the &s;trength of tho&s;e principles of growth which it contains within it&s;elf, it will likewi&s;e &s;eek nouri&s;hment from every thing external that can &s;upply it.&mdash;It will lay it&s;elf open to all the influence of ill example. The cor|rupted heart has a fixt bias to the &s;ociety and the imitation of the vicious. Whatever be its pre&s;ent temper, whether pa&s;&s;ion or con&s;cience predominates for the time, it pants for the company of the wicked with equal eagerne&s;s.
<PB N="52" REF="58">
When your vicious pa&s;&s;ions rage, they will drive you into it, that you may find the op|portunity of indulging them, and encourage|ment to give them full &s;cope. When con&s;ci|ence re&s;umes its place, and cuts you with its rebukes, you will flee from the torment of your own reflections, to the haunts of evil|doers, that the levity of the thoughtle&s;s may divert your remor&s;e, or that the audacity of hardier &s;inners may embolden you to di&s;regard it. From every advance which you make in vice, ill example will acquire additional power to pu&s;h you forward. The greater your own depravity is, the more ea&s;ily you will be re|conciled to vice by the cu&s;tom of &s;eeing it practi&s;ed. You will &s;carcely need to be in&s;ti|gated by the propen&s;ity to imitation: you are under the dominion of tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ions, from which it directly proceeds. By a&s;&s;ociat|ing together, &s;inners keep one another in countenance in pro&s;ecuting their evil cour&s;es, and are mutually incited to the pro&s;ecution of them by the &s;entiments, excu&s;es, and recom|mendations, which they in their turns &s;ugge&s;t. By yielding to the example, and entering into the &s;ociety, of the vicious, you will become more hardened in the vice to which you are already addicted; and you will be &s;educed into many others, to which you have natu|rally no di&s;po&s;ition. In the character of every
<PB N="53" REF="59">
wicked man, along with the vices which are properly of his own growth, there are &s;ome which have been planted and reared &s;olely by the influence of company and example. To this cau&s;e, the &s;in of cu&s;tomary &s;wearing, common as it is, mu&s;t be totally referred: there is no natural temptation to it, in the con&s;titu|tion or temperament of any human creature. Even a natural di&s;inclination to a particular vice, will &s;oon be conquered by the force of ill example: if your cho&s;en intimates be de|voted to it, you will learn to copy it from them. The man whom nature had endued with the quicke&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour, has often been enticed into the meane&s;t practices. The man whom nature had fortified by an ab&s;olute aver&s;ion to intoxicating liquors, has often be|come a drunkard, &s;ometimes the mo&s;t aban|doned to debauchery. The mode&s;te&s;t youth has &s;ometimes degenerated into the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s libertine. To frequent the a&s;&s;emblies of the wicked, is to take up your abode in a hou&s;e filled with the contagion of every mortal di&s;|ea&s;e. <HI>O my &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xlix. 6.</NOTE>. <HI>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. vi. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN whatever degree your vice becomes ha|bitual, it will have a tendency, proportionably,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
to alienate you from all the means of curbing it. It will incapacitate you for the devout ob|&s;ervance of religious ordinances; it will lead you on to the neglect of them; and from your coldne&s;s or neglect, it will draw fre&s;h vigour. It will weaken your faith of the great prin|ciples of religion, which condemn it, deaden your &s;en&s;e of them, draw off your attention from them, and deprive you of their aid in re&s;i&s;ting it. Con&s;cience will remon&s;trate le&s;s frequently and le&s;s warmly the farther you proceed; and when it does remon&s;trate, you will, with greater and greater anxiety and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;et your&s;elves to &s;ilence it. You can|not think of for&s;aking your &s;ins; and there|fore you will &s;tudy to make your&s;elves ea&s;y in them. Every &s;tep you take, you will the more eagerly gra&s;p at tho&s;e fal&s;e opinions and licentious &s;entiments which &s;eem to ju&s;tify or extenuate your &s;ins; and they will become the more effectual for encouraging you to take another &s;tep. You will the more &s;olicit|ou&s;ly avail your&s;elves of all the eva&s;ions and &s;ubterfuges of &s;elf-deceit; and in every &s;tage of your progre&s;s, it will furni&s;h &s;ome artful di&s;tinction, &s;ome delu&s;ive maxim, &s;ome plau|&s;ible di&s;gui&s;e, adapted to your &s;ituation, and calculated for producing &s;ecurity in it.</P>
<P>As long as your practice is confined to one favourite vice, which has not yet &s;educed you
<PB N="55" REF="61">
into the frequent commi&s;&s;ion of others, you will &s;oothe your&s;elves into the fearle&s;s indul|gence of it, by a fond per&s;ua&s;ion that it alone is not &s;ufficient to denominate you vicious men. You are faulty in <HI>this</HI> one <HI>thing;</HI> but in it <HI>the Lord</HI> will &s;urely <HI>pardon his &s;ervants</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings v. 13.</NOTE>; you neverthele&s;s have many virtues; the&s;e may make amends for one fault; and by means of the&s;e you may hope for the rewards of hea|ven. It is but a nece&s;&s;ary imperfection in&s;e|parable from fallen man. No human cha|racter was ever uniformly excellent; the pure&s;t has had &s;ome &s;tains, and the brighte&s;t &s;ome dark &s;hades. Every one of the holy men whom the Scripture mo&s;t commends, failed in &s;ome particular; and &s;ome of them were guilty of very heinous &s;ins. You therefore may well be allowed in your peculiar frailty. But between the acts of &s;in into which good men have &s;ometimes been &s;urprized, and the practice of &s;in in which you live; between the temporary defections for which they mourned, and the cu&s;tomary tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which you ju&s;tify to your&s;elves; between the iniquities from which they &s;peedily recovered them&s;elves by repentance, and tho&s;e in which you deliberately re&s;olve to per&s;i&s;t; there is the wide&s;t difference. If you live in the habit of
<PB N="56" REF="62">
any one &s;in, you are as truly, though not in &s;o high a degree, wilful and pre&s;umptuous &s;in|ners, as they who abandon them&s;elves to more. God is &s;o far from granting you allowance in your beloved vice, that again&s;t it he requires you to employ your mo&s;t &s;pecial care.</P>
<P>WHEN any vicious pa&s;&s;ion, by being con|firmed into habit, has become &s;o powerful that it conquers you on every the &s;lighte&s;t temptation, you will begin to flatter your&s;elves that therefore it is only a &s;in of infirmity, for which God will never call you to a rigorous account. Though you fall &s;o often before it, you approve it not, you &s;ubmit not quietly to its dominion, you form frequent purpo&s;es again&s;t it: but &s;till it prevails over the &s;en&s;e of your minds, and overthrows your &s;tronge&s;t purpo&s;es; and this convinces you that it ari&s;es unavoidably from the frailty of your nature, and will find an ea&s;y pardon. To facilitate the deception, you will labour to per&s;uade your&s;elves, that it is but a &s;mall tre&s;pa&s;s; and no vice is &s;o enormous, but exorbitant pa&s;|&s;ion may impo&s;e it on a corrupted con&s;cience, as a &s;mall tre&s;pa&s;s. You compare your own &s;ins with the mo&s;t flagitious practices of other men; and becau&s;e you perceive them to be le&s;s, you conclude them to be venal. You do not &s;coff at religion, though you neglect all its du|ties:
<PB N="57" REF="63">
you oppre&s;s not your dependents to ab|&s;olute ruin, though you hara&s;s them with &s;everity: you are not murderers, though you be injurious: you live not in adultery, though you indulge your&s;elves in whoredom: you are not &s;unk into the &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of &s;olitary drunkenne&s;s, though you never &s;cruple to join in the riots of your company. If all the par|tiality of &s;elf-deceit cannot repre&s;ent your &s;in as &s;mall in it&s;elf, you will extenuate it into a &s;in of infirmity, by referring it to the peculi|arity of your temper or your &s;ituation: it is &s;o deeply rooted in your con&s;titution, it grows &s;o nece&s;&s;arily out of your circum&s;tances or oc|cupation, it is &s;o in&s;eparably connected with your intere&s;t and views, that to you it is inevi|table, and you mu&s;t be pardonable in yield|ing to it. But you deceive your&s;elves. That only can be a &s;in of infirmity, which proceeds from excu&s;eable ignorance, or &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e. What is contrary to an expre&s;s command of God, what you know to be at all a &s;in at the time of committing it, what needs refinement for reconciling it to the native &s;entiments of your hearts, mu&s;t merit a very different name. It is a known, deliberate, wilful di&s;obedience of your Maker. By gro&s;s abu&s;e of your&s;elves, you have fir&s;t contracted &s;trong habits of vice; and now, when their &s;trength is irre&s;i&s;tible, you fooli&s;hly imagine that they are therefore but
<PB N="58" REF="64">
pitiable frailties. The imagination is &s;o de&s;pe|rately ab&s;urd, as nece&s;&s;arily to imply, that the more inveterate your vices are become, the more they are intitled to indulgence and for|givene&s;s. If you can infatuate your&s;elves into the belief of it, you may obtain tranquil|lity in your cu&s;tomary &s;ins: but you will, at the &s;ame time, harden your&s;elves in them, and prevent your ever thinking of that repentance, without which they mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue in your eternal ruin.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, again, the habitual &s;inner quiets his con&s;cience by devi&s;ing &s;uper&s;titious equivalents for the virtue which he &s;uffers him&s;elf to violate. He cannot abandon his vices, but he will make amends for them: he will punctiliou&s;ly ob&s;erve all the rituals of re|ligion, he will believe all its doctrines, he will be mo&s;t violently zealous again&s;t tho&s;e whom he conceives to be erroneous. The ambitious, the covetous, the unju&s;t, the voluptuous, will make any atonement, any compen&s;ation, which does not preclude him from the indulgence of his beloved vice; and by per&s;uading him&s;elf that it will avail, he is lulled into a fatal &s;e|curity. Hence the characters in which the &s;hifts of avarice, the tricks of di&s;hone&s;ty, the revellings of debauchery, or the arts of ambi|tion, are unnaturally conjoined with a high
<PB N="59" REF="65">
profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and a pre&s;umptuous conceit of extraordinary &s;anctity.</P>
<P>FINALLY, when habitual &s;inners can find no means of concealing from them&s;elves the turpitude of tho&s;e vices to which they are ad|dicted, they notwith&s;tanding reconcile their minds to the perpetration of them, by &s;ome imperfect motions of pre&s;ent repentance, or half-re&s;olutions of future reformation. You condemn your&s;elves in what you do; you re|gret every act of &s;in as &s;oon almo&s;t as it is done; you lament that you are not better, and wi&s;h earne&s;tly that you were: and you hope that this is repentance, and &s;hows your heart to be right, however faulty your con|duct be. If there be any defect in this, you will &s;upply it hereafter; you cannot think of encountering the difficulties of a complete re|formation, at pre&s;ent; but at a more conve|nient &s;ea&s;on, when you have enjoyed your &s;ins a little longer, you are determined that you will accompli&s;h it. Strange! to pervert tho&s;e checks and rebukes of con&s;cience, which pro|claim your guilt, into an evidence that you are guiltle&s;s! to dream that your &s;inning again&s;t conviction, is repentance! to conclude that God will not condemn you, becau&s;e you cannot help condemning your&s;elves! Your re&s;olutions are as full of ab&s;urdity as your
<PB N="66" REF="66">
&s;entiments: at the very time you are doing an action, you re&s;olve to di&s;approve and condemn it afterwards; you re&s;olve that hereafter, when it &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible to undo it, you will heartily wi&s;h that undone, which you will not leave undone, now when it is ab&s;o|lutely in your power to ab&s;tain from doing it. A re&s;olution to repent hereafter, is incon&s;i&s;tent with every degree of hone&s;ty of heart&mdash;and it never will be executed; every impediment to pre&s;ent reformation, every difficulty in effect|ing it, every rea&s;on for delay, will continue and daily gather &s;trength. You may repeat, and again repeat your re&s;olution to reform; but you will never &s;et about actual reforma|tion. While you regret that you are &s;inning, and yet go on; while you re&s;olve to amend, and amend not immediately; you are the &s;laves of &s;in, and likely to die in bondage to it. <HI>To-day, while it is called to-day, harden not your hearts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 7, 8, 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN we thus di&s;play the long train of wickedne&s;s which &s;prings naturally and una|voidably from the lea&s;t vicious indulgence, you perhaps con&s;ider it as in a great mea&s;ure the work of imagination. You think you can ea&s;ily go a &s;hort way in vice, when your plea|&s;ure
<PB N="61" REF="67">
or your intere&s;t requires it, without any danger of becoming abandoned to it. You have already ventured on &s;ome acts of &s;in, but you are certain that you can forbear them when you plea&s;e: you have yielded to your favourite vice, and you have found no nece&s;|&s;ary connexion between it and other vices. But can you &s;ay, that you have found no con|nexion? Perhaps you have not yet run into them. But have you not been &s;ometimes tempted to them? Has never your cu&s;tomary &s;in hinted that you might make trial of them? Yes, but you abhor them. Rather than be guilty of them, you will renounce the mo&s;t beloved vice. This may be your pre&s;ent opi|nion: after cu&s;tom has effaced a man's dete&s;|tation of familiar &s;ins, he may continue to re|gard a higher degree, or another &s;pecies of guilt with horror. But by a little longer prac|tice, this likewi&s;e will be effaced, and that very guilt incurred without &s;cruple. Recollect Hazael, and be alarmed for your&s;elves. You cannot feel &s;tronger indignation again&s;t any crime, than he expre&s;&s;ed when the Prophet foretold his future enormities. <HI>Is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings viii. 13.</NOTE>? His ambition was yet young, but it quickly ro&s;e to &s;trength, and drove him into all the barba|rities
<PB N="62" REF="68">
which he had &s;o confidently di&s;claimed. The effects of wickedne&s;s are always carried far beyond the &s;inner's fir&s;t de&s;ign. Nothing could prevail upon you to leap from the top of a high tower; but by an ea&s;y &s;cale of &s;teps you will without fear de&s;cend to the very &s;ame depth. From the fir&s;t wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to confirmation in wickedne&s;s, the de&s;cent is &s;o ea&s;y that every tran&s;ition is &s;carcely percep|tible. One act of &s;in, in many ways induces the repetition of it; repetition nece&s;&s;arily forms a habit of it: the habit impels to frequent prac|tice, and by practice becomes inveterate. The practice, the habit of one &s;in leads on to other &s;ins; prepares the &s;oul for greater crimes; be|gets temptations to them; demands them for concealing it; involves you in them as its inevitable con&s;equences; or impo&s;es them upon you as nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport and exe|cution; and quickly rears them al&s;o into e&s;ta|bli&s;hed habits. Habitual vice lays you open to all the power of ill example, to all the influence of loo&s;e principles, to all the artifices of &s;elf|deceit; and by means of the&s;e, you will be|come irreclaimable, and yet fearle&s;s in all your vicious cour&s;es. Smooth, and often rapid, is the progre&s;s; but fatal is the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>How carefully then ought they, who have yet retained their innocence, &s;till to hold it
<PB N="63" REF="69">
fa&s;t? You cannot gue&s;s beforehand, of what depravity, trouble, and mi&s;ery, you lay the foundation, when you make the fir&s;t &s;tep into a bad cour&s;e. Fully retrieved it can never be. However early you retract it, it mu&s;t be with pungent &s;orrow, with painful &s;truggling, and with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt never to be totally obliterated. But it is not probable that you will retract it early: a downward motion is not ea&s;ily repre&s;&s;ed. If you commit one &s;in, you can hardly avoid committing many more: if you commit many &s;ins, you mu&s;t contract &s;trong vicious habits; and if the&s;e be once contracted, they will render you the irredeem|able &s;laves of vice. It is with a trembling heart that the virtuous friend, or the attentive parent &s;ees the inexperienced youth engaging in the commerce of the world; a few of his fir&s;t &s;teps may very probably determine his charac|ter through life, and his &s;tate through eter|nity.</P>
<P>How, then, &s;hall we addre&s;s tho&s;e who have already proceeded far in vicious cour&s;es? Your condition is imminently dangerous. You are going &s;traight forward in the road to de&s;truc|tion; and the farther you have gone, the more violently you are compelled to go farther. Stop &s;hort, while yet there is a po&s;|&s;ibility. However little a way you have pro|ceeded,
<PB N="64" REF="70">
you will find abundant difficulty in returning; another &s;tep will make a great ad|dition to it. You cannot pa&s;s at once from the path of vice into that of virtue; they touch only at their entrance; in their progre&s;s they &s;eparate to an unmea&s;urable di&s;tance: to cro&s;s into the path of virtue, will require more laborious and tedious exertions than you have made in wandering from it; it is like toiling up a &s;teep a&s;cent, where the &s;and is continually &s;lipping from beneath your feet, and fru&s;trates more than half your effort. By every hour's continuance in evil cour&s;es, the power of &s;in is &s;trengthened, the vigour of the &s;oul im|paired, and the principles of reformation weakened. How &s;eldom is the practi&s;ed &s;inner perfectly recovered to virtue? <HI>Be not therefore without fear, to add &s;in unto &s;in</HI> any more: <HI>make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord; and put not off from day to day: for &s;uddenly &s;hall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy &s;ecurity thou &s;halt be de&s;troyed, and peri&s;h in the day of vengeance</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecclu&s;. v. 5&punc; 7.</NOTE>.

<P>IT is a common prejudice again&s;t religion, that it is for &s;ome time difficult and painful, at lea&s;t to &s;uch as have been for|merly engaged in vicious cour&s;es, who mu&s;t undergo a &s;evere di&s;cipline of mortification and &s;elf-denial, before they can find any plea|&s;ure in it.

To every well-di&s;po&s;ed mind, a heinous &s;in is at fir&s;t the object of dread and horror. Before a man can think without reluctance of com|mitting

it, before he can &s;et about it with|out trepidation of heart and confu&s;ion of face, before he can reflect on it without pun|gent remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation, he mu&s;t not only &s;uffer many an unea&s;y &s;truggle with|in, between the irregular pa&s;&s;ions which urge him to it, and con&s;cience which forbids it; but he mu&s;t likewi&s;e, by many outward actions of ba&s;ene&s;s, intermingled with &s;ea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction and dread, wear out all the principles of mode&s;ty and ingenuity, which were the glory of his nature. By per&s;everance in wicked|ne&s;s, he may at length become ea&s;y in it: but his ea&s;e is only &s;tupe&s;action in guilt, and &s;ecurity on the brink of de&s;truction. It is founded in the corruption of his heart; it is always in proportion to the inveteracy of that corruption; it is the de&s;perate period of a mortal di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mper, in which a man is cru&s;hed beneath its power, thinks not of a remedy, or becomes fond of his di&s;ea&s;e. In&s;tead of a re|commendation of vice, it is one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments again&s;t it; and when we con&s;ider how in&s;en&s;ibly, and almo&s;t unavoidably, the man who is once engaged in vice, is drawn forward to this &s;tate of mind, the argument becomes truly alarming. I have propo&s;ed to enforce it, by tracing out the &s;inner's progre&s;s <HI>from evil to evil.</HI> In pur&s;uing this de&s;ign, I have, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> pointed out tho&s;e &s;teps of mental

<P>IN pointing out the &s;inner's progre&s;s to habitual vice, we have ob&s;erved that his aver|&s;ion to it, his reluctance to practi&s;e it, and his pain in the con&s;ciou&s;nc&s;s of it, continually grow weaker. At length they are almo&s;t to|tally effaced; he becomes <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> to its ba&s;e|ne&s;s and its wretchedne&s;s. In&s;en&s;ibility in &s;in is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of being enured to it; and it forms a principal part of its maturity. Cu&s;tom, which &s;trengthens our active propen&s;ities, never fails to weaken pa&s;|&s;ive impre&s;&s;ions: the frequent &s;ight of di&s;tre&s;s blunts the emotions of pity; the being often expo&s;ed to danger impairs the &s;en&s;ation of fear; the being long forced to bear in&s;ults and indignities, deadens the pungency of that mortification with which they are felt at fir&s;t. The cu&s;tom of committing &s;in wears off the the unea&s;ine&s;s, the &s;hame, and the dread,

which the thought of it once produced. Con|&s;cience, which formerly eyed it with horror, remon&s;trated again&s;t it, and faithfully repre|&s;ented its ba&s;ene&s;s and its mi&s;ery, becomes &s;o blind that it cannot &s;ee the evil of &s;in, &s;o heedle&s;s that it will not reprove it, or &s;o de|bauched that it excu&s;es and defends it. Its &s;tronge&s;t checks and its &s;harpe&s;t rebukes have been de&s;pi&s;ed or eluded, and now it cea&s;es from them; it is become <HI>&s;eared with a hot iron</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>; it is reprobate and undi&s;cerning.

<P>IN this &s;tate of obduracy, the &s;inner can reflect upon the mo&s;t heinous particulars of his abandoned conduct without &s;orrow or re|gret. Long cu&s;tom of &s;inning has taken away the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his guilt. Remor&s;e, which never fails to wound the tender heart of a novice in vice, cannot touch the callous &s;oul of the proficient. The yoke of &s;in no longer galls his neck: he has <HI>hardened</HI> it; he has <HI>made it an iron &s;inew</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Jer. vii. 26. I&s;a. xlviii. 4.</NOTE>. Habituated to the &s;lavery of &s;in, he forgets his chains. In a condition which by all the declarations of the go&s;pel excludes him from the happine&s;s of heaven, and which in its own nature renders him incapable of happine&s;s, he &s;its down &s;e|cure and unconcerned, without a de&s;ire of re|formation, without one thought of altering his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;inner can make him&s;elf ea&s;y under the load of guilt which he has already contracted, he will likewi&s;e go on without reluctance to contract new guilt. The &s;ame depravity which &s;mothers remor&s;e for former
<PB N="70" REF="76">
crimes, precludes repugnance to fre&s;h tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. Whenever con&s;cience cea&s;es from its rebukes, it of cour&s;e gives over its remon|&s;trances. As often as an opportunity occurs, the hardened &s;inner runs into vice without thought, without almo&s;t knowing that he is doing wrong. He has freed him&s;elf from every re&s;traint. By his being &s;o long addicted to what is ba&s;e, his con&s;cience is &s;ilenced, his dete&s;tation and dread of &s;in, his &s;en&s;e of its vile and &s;hameful nature, and his apprehen|&s;ions of its mi&s;erable con&s;equences, are in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t. He thinks neither of the goodne&s;s of God, nor of his wrath. He re|gards not the obligations of virtue, nor any of the motives of the go&s;pel. The mode&s;ty, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his early wanderings from duty, has for&s;aken him; he has no re&s;pect to his own character, or to the opinion of others; he abandons him&s;elf to &s;in in broad day-light, without a ma&s;k, without a blu&s;h. It mu&s;t be a very atrocious deed from which he will &s;tart back. He is like tho&s;e who are reported to have rendered poi&s;on &s;o familiar to them, by the cu&s;tom of &s;wallowing it, that they could dige&s;t a great quantity of it without any &s;en&s;ation of pain. By a cour&s;e of rebel|lion again&s;t con&s;cience, he has not only broken its power, but learned to de&s;pi&s;e its autho|rity.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">BY being long habituated to vice, a man becomes not only in&s;en&s;ible, but likewi&s;e <HI>in|flexible</HI> and irreclaimable. The&s;e two charac|ters are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, that the Scripture includes both under the &s;ame term, <HI>hardne&s;s of heart.</HI> Both are clearly di&s;cernible in the de&s;criptions which it gives of the obduracy with which the Prophets and the Me&s;&s;iah &s;o often charge the degenerate Jews. Of the in|&s;en&s;ibility which we have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, ob&s;tinate adherence to vice is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. In every nature there is origi|nally a principle of &s;elf-re&s;toration; when it is a little put out of order, it labours to re|cover it&s;elf. Storms and tempe&s;ts are the agitations of the elements endeavouring to di&s;charge the noxious vapours which have in|fected them; and they are &s;ucceeded by a whole&s;ome calm. Agues and fevers in the human body, are the &s;truggles of its remain|ing vigour to expel &s;ome malignant humours which threaten its di&s;&s;olution; and when they cea&s;e without producing this effect, a broken con&s;titution or &s;peedy death en&s;ues. Vice is the di&s;order, the di&s;ea&s;e, the mi&s;ery of moral agents: as long as the mind retains any &s;oundne&s;s, it makes efforts to throw it off: regret, remor&s;e, &s;elf-condemnation, con&s;idera|tion of the rea&s;ons for virtue, re&s;olutions of amendment, are no other than its motions to|wards
<PB N="72" REF="78">
repentance, its endeavours after reform|ation. When by per&s;everance in wicked|ne&s;s they are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the very principle of &s;elf-re&s;titution is lo&s;t, the di&s;temper is incu|rable. When a man is unaffected with all the &s;ins which he has committed, how can he think of for&s;aking them? When he has no &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in, how can he be brought to abhor and avoid it? His &s;leep will be a perpetual &s;leep. To arou&s;e him, would be to give feeling to a mortified limb, or motion to a dead carca&s;e. He is blind to all moral con|&s;iderations: he is impenetrable by exhortation, by reproof, by the mercies, by the judgments of God, by all incentives to amendment. There is nothing remaining in his &s;oul on which they can take hold. In &s;pite of all po&s;&s;ible motives to virtue, he has ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued his wicked cour&s;es; they could not re|&s;train him when they operated with their full force; how then can they reclaim him now, when, by being often ba&s;&s;led, they have lo&s;t their force; and when, by the inveteracy of habit, he is &s;teeled again&s;t them? In a Chri&s;tian, hard|ne&s;s of heart has been contracted in contempt of all the means of recovery which the go&s;pel can &s;upply: they might reform a heathen; but for correcting his depravity, a new revelation, of greater efficacy than the go&s;pel, would &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary. None &s;uch will be given;

Were they even indulged with a new revelation, it is not pro|bable that they would repent. After the Jews had, in contempt of Mo&s;es and the Prophets, become obdurate in wickedne&s;s, the go&s;pel was granted to them; but they trampled it likewi&s;e under foot, remained impenitent, and made a dreadful addition to their guilt.</P>
<P>THE inflexibility of the hardened &s;inner is &s;ecured, not only by his in&s;en&s;ibility, but by the &s;trength of his vicious habits. How dif|ficult it is to break off any habit even the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, the experience of every day proclaims. A confirmed habit few have re|&s;olution to attempt eradicating. The labour, the care, the con&s;tancy of vigilance which it requires, is almo&s;t incredible. After the pains of years, it is di&s;covered that &s;ome fibre has remained, which &s;hoots anew, and demands a repetition of the toil. How then can deep-rooted habits of vice be extirpated? Could the hardened &s;inner feel the whole
<PB N="74" REF="80">
force of all the arguments for undertaking the extirpation of them, they &s;carcely could pre|vail. His habits are become too &s;tubborn to bend before them; they are too much indu|rated to yield to the edge of rea&s;on. By length of time, the habits of the mind, as well as the members of the body, become &s;tiff and rigid. The man who has through life accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to &s;in, is chained fa&s;t by his lu&s;ts; and in chains, what can he do for his own relea&s;e? He has not the power to reform, though he had the inclination. He has gone &s;o far, that he is frightened at the length and ruggedne&s;s of the way by which he mu&s;t return; he doubts whether it be po&s;&s;ible; de&s;pondence &s;u&s;pends all his powers, and de|prives him of all heart to purpo&s;e it. The Scripture therefore de&s;cribes hardened &s;inners as not only <HI>abominable and di&s;obedient,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>unto every good work reprobate</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 16.</NOTE>; &s;o far <HI>alienated from the life of God,</HI> as to <HI>have given them&s;elves over unto la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, to work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 18, 19.</NOTE>; in <HI>the &s;nare of the Devil, taken captive by him at his will</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 26.</NOTE>. The &s;tain of &s;in may &s;ink &s;o deep as to tincture the &s;oul throughout. The habit of wickedne&s;s becomes a &s;econd na|ture; the whole propen&s;ion of the heart is as much to &s;in, as the tendency of a &s;tone to
<PB N="75" REF="81">
fall, or of &s;parks to fly upwards; to correct it, is almo&s;t as difficult as to alter the original powers of the mind. By wallowing in &s;en&s;uality, men may be degraded into bea&s;ts: by re&s;igning them&s;elves to malevolence, they may be tran&s;|formed into fiends. The incorrigible ob&s;tinacy of habitual &s;inners, and the de&s;perate danger of their condition is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed by the Prophet; <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good, that are accu&s;tomed to do evil</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 23.</NOTE>. But if you will ob&s;erve with what compo&s;ure and per&s;ever|ance you &s;ee the mi&s;er continuing his penu|rious &s;hifts, the rapacious multiplying his rapines, the unju&s;t executing his villanies, the drunkard repeating his debauches, the profligate of every denomination pur&s;uing his own cour&s;e to the very la&s;t, you can &s;carcely imagine even that de&s;cription to be exaggerated.</P>
<P>Is it then impo&s;&s;ible that they who have become hardened in vicious cour&s;es, &s;hould be reclaimed from them? <HI>With men,</HI> I am afraid, we mu&s;t determine <HI>this is impo&s;&s;ible, but with God all things are po&s;&s;ible</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xix. 26.</NOTE>.

<P>IN the earlier periods of their degeneracy&punc; men &s;ometimes venture to treat particular acts of virtue or vice with deri&s;ion, or even to je&s;t with the &s;anctity and the importance of moral obligation. In that ca&s;e, it is the ef|fu&s;ion of unthinking levity; it is the ill-judged affectation of with and plea&s;antry; it is the heedle&s;s mimickry of the profane &s;coffer; it is an a&s;&s;umed di&s;gui&s;e of inward pangs from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt; or it is a fond attempt
<PB N="79" REF="85">
to obtain tranquillity in vices which they have not re&s;olution to for&s;ake. It is belied by the real &s;entiments of their hearts, and intermixt with checks of con&s;cience and mi&s;givings of &s;oul. From whatever cau&s;e it proceeds, it is fooli&s;h and highly culpable; and it is of the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence. It gradually &s;aps the authority of con&s;cience, le&s;&s;ens the power of its decrees, wears off the reverence due to virtue, and prepares the way for re|garding &s;in as a light and trivial failing. But in the veteran &s;inner, it proceeds from cau&s;es which lie deeper, and it implies the blacke&s;t corruption. His temper is a contradiction to virtue; and therefore he hates it, and &s;upports his hatred by repre&s;enting it as contemptible. Vice has interwoven it&s;elf with all the exer|tions of his &s;oul; and therefore he &s;tudiou&s;ly ju&s;tifies and commends it. His &s;coffing is not the unmeaning je&s;t of giddine&s;s, but the de|&s;igning &s;neer of malignity. It is the effect of that fal&s;e peace which, by &s;mothering his &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, he has obtained in adding &s;in to &s;in. It is indulged with eagerne&s;s and complacence; <HI>the &s;corners delight in their &s;corn|ing</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 22.</NOTE>.

can proceed: it throws ridicule on all the &s;en|timents which can in&s;tigate to reformation. When a man has long addicted him&s;elf to any cour&s;e, this alone is often &s;ufficient to make him a&s;hamed to alter it: but when he has moreover &s;et him&s;elf, on every occa&s;ion, to maintain and applaud it, to expo&s;e and vi|lify the contrary cour&s;e, and to deride tho&s;e who pur&s;ue it, how can he have the courage to re&s;olve upon amendment? His je&s;ts would be all retorted on him&s;elf: he mu&s;t encounter not the &s;coffs of others only, but his own. He hates to be reformed.</P>
<P>SCOFFING at the practice of religion, is &s;ometimes united with belief of its principles. They who would think with horror of deny|ing the exi&s;tence of God, glory in living <HI>with|out God in the world</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 12.</NOTE>.

mi&s;ery. It &s;hews to what a deplorable pitch vice can infatuate the &s;oul: it be&s;ets it into &s;uch &s;tupidity, that it cannot di&s;cern the mo&s;t palpable repugnances.</P>
<P>BUT very often the deri&s;ion of the &s;corner extends it&s;elf to the principles of religion. The mo&s;t &s;acred, venerable and important truths, the being of God, the external &s;tate of retribution, the divinity of the go&s;pel, its excellence, its &s;ublime doctrines, its precious promi&s;es, its awful threatenings, are made the cho&s;en objects of his &s;currilous wit and di&s;&s;olute mirth. If any of the&s;e have been mi&s;under&s;tood through the weakne&s;s of be|lievers, the unde&s;igned mi&s;repre&s;entation is greedily laid hold of, unfairly &s;ub&s;tituted in place of the reality, exaggerated to the ut|mo&s;t that it may the better receive the fal&s;e colouring of ridicule. In every &s;tep of his progre&s;s <HI>from evil to evil,</HI> the &s;inner is gra|dually trained to this extremity of corrup|tion; and by obduracy in wickedne&s;s, he is completely prepared for it. The &s;portivene&s;s of childhood and the vivacity of youth, un|corrected by reverence for religious truth, is &s;ometimes found to overflow in an indecent je&s;t on &s;ome principle which ought to be regarded as &s;acred, and never mentioned but with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Its being heard without

The novice in vice, panting for liberty to gratify his indulged pa&s;&s;ions, or to palliate from him&s;elf, and ju&s;tify to others, the deviations into which they have betrayed him, catches at the licen|tious po&s;itions or the ludicrous images which he has learned from the proficient in wic|kedne&s;s, inculcates them on his recoiling heart, and produces them with &s;eeming com|placence, but often with real compunction and mi&s;tru&s;t.

The abandoned to vice would gladly di&s;believe them: to confute them by arguments, is above his power; to de&s;troy his reverence for them, by profane &s;coffing&punc; is an ea&s;ier ta&s;k, and will almo&s;t as effectually &s;e|cure his peace, or perhaps facilitate his infide|lity. Inveterate habits of wickedne&s;s cannot fail to &s;et men in oppo&s;ition to religion which is incompatible with them. This is the very account which our Saviour gives of the con|tempt and malice with which the Jews treated his in&s;tructions: <HI>They loved darkne&s;s rather than light:</HI> Why? <HI>Becau&s;e their deeds were evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 19. 20.</NOTE>.

and he &s;hews deeper depravity of mind. To mi&s;repre&s;ent the tenets of religion, is not wit, but folly. To be incapable of &s;hining, except by means of irreligion, betrays a want of parts. To contemn the mo&s;t venerable things, and to be merry with the mo&s;t &s;erious, &s;hows a &s;hameful perver&s;ion of ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment. To affect expo&s;ing by banter, what you cannot confute by argument, and what you have never examined with diligence, implies a heart lo&s;t to every thing that is ingenuous in human nature. If the prin|ciples of religion be true, their importance mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed: nothing &s;hort of a demon|&s;tration of their fal&s;ity can ju&s;tify your treat|ing them either with &s;pite or with levity: but the utmo&s;t effrontery of infidelity dare not boa&s;t of &s;uch a demon&s;tration.</P>

guilt. To a&s;&s;imilate others to our&s;elves, is a de&s;ire natural to the &s;oul. When men are determined to per&s;i&s;t in their vices, and have laid a&s;ide every thought of reforming them|&s;elves, they will become intent on perverting others into the &s;ame evil cour&s;es, and forming them to the like character. Many vices can be practi&s;ed only in &s;ociety: the man who is addicted to them, mu&s;t &s;earch for fit a&s;&s;o|ciates; and if he meets not with &s;uch as of choice <HI>run with him to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 4.</NOTE>, he mu&s;t, for enjoying his own vices, draw them on to it. Many vices cannot yield their full mea&s;ure of advantage to him who delights in them, except they be likewi&s;e practi&s;ed by others: the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the mi&s;er receives a direct gratification from the par&s;imony of all who depend upon him, as well as from his own penuriou&s;ne&s;s, and will therefore in&s;ti|gate him to model them according to his own maxims: di&s;hone&s;ty of every &s;pecies requires accomplices or in&s;truments for executing its &s;chemes, and mu&s;t fa&s;hion them to its pur|po&s;es, by debauching them from all the prin|ciples of ju&s;tice. Every vice is kept in coun|tenance by numbers; and no vice is &s;o completely &s;atisfied with it&s;elf, even in the mo&s;t degenerate nature, as not to gra&s;p eagerly
<PB N="87" REF="93">
at this appearance of patronage, and labour to procure it. A vitiated palate takes plea&s;ure in the vile&s;t favours, a di&s;ordered mind is gratified by the mo&s;t improper objects; and a heart depraved into the love of vice, cannot but feel an unnatural &s;atisfaction in its pre|valence. To &s;ee others yielding to his in|fluence, or copying after his example, though it be in wickedne&s;s, gives the profligate an opi|nion of his own authority and importance, that flatters the illegitimate and inverted pride for which his profligacy has prepared him. So great is the corruption into which human na|ture may fall by continuance in vice, that &s;ome find a po&s;itive and ultimate delight in &s;educing the thoughtle&s;s, corrupting the inno|cent, and encouraging the timid &s;inner to go greater lengths. They will per&s;uade or delude them into the mo&s;t atrocious crimes. They will &s;cruple no method by which it can be accompli&s;hed. They content not them&s;elves with &s;preading vice by the mo&s;t flagrant ex|ample: they recommend it; they &s;et it off to the be&s;t advantage; they employ all their art to produce enchanting pictures of it; they point out the way to it; they lead the reluc|tant by the hand into its darke&s;t retreats; they &s;edulou&s;ly mock at whatever might prove a re&s;traint from it.

They direct all their &s;coffs to the propagation of iniquity. Shocking as this degree of wickedne&s;s is, there have been many in&s;tances of it in every age. Solomon de|&s;cribes it in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of his writings.

perpetration of it. The pro&s;tituted pander to wickedne&s;s, mu&s;t be nearly pa&s;t redemption. A con&s;cience &s;o thoroughly debauched cannot be re&s;tored to a vigorous &s;en&s;e of guilt: a heart &s;o completely obdurate cannot feel its &s;ting. The guilt is &s;o dreadfully accumulated, that a lively &s;en&s;e of it, in&s;tead of impelling him to repentance, would mo&s;t probably overwhelm him with de&s;pair, in thinking of the multitude of his &s;ins, and the numbers whom he has contributed to contaminate and ruin. He ventures not to hope for mercy; he cannot bring him&s;elf to pray for it; his &s;oul cannot frame a wi&s;h from which it has been &s;o long and &s;o far alienated. By the hardne&s;s of his heart, he knows that God withholds his grace. If he feels that in all this God is ju&s;t, it aggra|vates his torture: the long &s;uffering of God abu&s;ed and exhau&s;ted, the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t rejected and forfeited, oppre&s;s him with un&s;uf|ferable angui&s;h.

It is a &s;hocking, a confounding object. It cannot be beheld without horror. If any of you &s;hud|der at it, be careful to turn your terror to your own advantage. It inculcates the mo&s;t im|portant le&s;&s;ons in the mo&s;t alarming manner, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered in connexion with the &s;everal gradations which, from the fir&s;t deviation into vice, almo&s;t imperceptibly lead forward to it.</P>
<P>THE whole of this &s;ubject &s;erves as an aw|ful warning to tho&s;e who are &s;o happy as not to be yet engaged in any vicious cour&s;e. I can|not conclude it, without again be&s;eeching the young and the innocent to guard again&s;t the fir&s;t deviation from virtue, however &s;mall it may appear, and however &s;trong you may think the inducements to it.

In vain you think of &s;in|ning in moderation, of &s;etting bounds to your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, of going only a certain length, but no farther: you might as well attempt to re&s;train the raging of the ocean. Vice creeps on by little &s;teps, but with an uninterrupted progre&s;&s;ion. By the &s;malle&s;t failure in care and recollection, you will &s;lide from what is lawful, into what is &s;u&s;picious; from that into what is plainly &s;inful; from le&s;&s;er into greater tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; from acts into cu&s;to|mary practice; from &s;trong inclinations into deliberate habits; from one habit into ano|ther; from le&s;s to more inveteracy; from the practice of wickedne&s;s to the love of it. The connexion between the &s;lighte&s;t vicious indul|gence, and the blacke&s;t guilt, though formed by many links, is indi&s;&s;oluble.

con&s;ent not, even in your hearts, to the de|mands of any irregular pa&s;&s;ion. To re&s;train the extravagance of thought, and to check the fir&s;t ri&s;ing of unlawful pa&s;&s;ion, is the ea&s;ie&s;t, as well as the &s;ure&s;t, means of preventing hard|ne&s;s of heart and future mi&s;ery. It will require inten&s;e and con&s;tant care: but if this be ne|glected, to repent, to keep you in the &s;tate of penitence, to pre&s;erve you from relap&s;es into &s;in, will require much more painful vigilance. The &s;tronge&s;t inclination to &s;in, which you can feel at pre&s;ent, bears no proportion to the violence of de&s;ire to per&s;i&s;t and to go on in &s;in, which will torment you, if you once enter into its ways.

The di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;oul, as well as of the body, are ea&s;ie&s;t to be cured at fir&s;t; by continuance they become more ob&s;tinate; and by long con|tinuance a &s;light ailment may grow to &s;uch a head as to baffle the mo&s;t powerful medicine. While the &s;inner only &s;lumbers, a &s;light touch will rou&s;e him: if he falls a&s;leep, it will require a &s;trong pull to awaken him: but if he &s;inks into a lethargy, what force is &s;ufficient to re|move it? and if he is dead in &s;in, what but a miracle can rai&s;e him to &s;piritual life?

<P>THE de&s;ire of life is common to all animals; and it is the &s;tronge&s;t prin|ciple in every nature. In other animals, it is wholly in&s;tinctive: in man, the in&s;tinct is &s;trengthened by &s;entiment, and &s;upported by reflexion. In the day of high health and pro&s;perity, when our plea&s;ures are many, and our &s;orrows few, when we indulge &s;anguine hopes, and li&s;ten not to the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear, life &s;eems to have charms &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a warm attachment to it. A per&s;on cut off in the&s;e circum&s;tances is always the object of our tendere&s;t regret. When the &s;upport of a family, or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of friends, depends on a per&s;on's life, he feels him&s;elf in&s;tigated by benevolence to earne&s;t

<P>THE love of life continues &s;trong, even when it is oppo&s;ed by &s;entiment, and di&s;ap|proved by reflexion. There may be moments in the life of mo&s;t men, in which they ima|gine that it is extingui&s;hed: but they are very few; and in the&s;e few, men only <HI>imagine</HI> that they have got rid of it. Under the fir&s;t &s;hock or the violent pre&s;&s;ure of a great cala|mity, they cry out that life is not worth the living. But at that very in&s;tant, if they were put to the trial, they would be found unwill|ing to re&s;ign it; and no &s;ooner is the weight of their affliction abated, than they &s;hew as &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for life as before. They &s;up|po&s;e them&s;elves indifferent about life, when they are weary of its di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The de&s;ire of life is far from being extinct, even in him who can ta&s;te no &s;atisfaction in his pre&s;ent condition, and who regards all that is pa&s;t as vanity. Of the mo&s;t di&s;contented, of the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate heart, the fir&s;t wi&s;h always is for a life of greater enjoyment, and free from the wants and di&s;appointments which

<P>FIRST, That long life is in many re&s;pects <HI>unde&s;ireable,</HI> may be evinced by arguments drawn&mdash;from the general nature of human life,&mdash;from the peculiar attendants of long life;&mdash;and from the &s;uperior happine&s;s of the future life.</P>
<P>1. THE general nature of human life leads us to reflexions which may rea&s;onably check an eager pa&s;&s;ion for length of days. <HI>I would not live alway, for my days are vanity.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h not to exaggerate the evils of life: it cannot &s;erve any good purpo&s;e.

injure it. It is pious to extol the future world; the pre&s;ent will not bear to be com|pared with it: but to depreciate the pre&s;ent as unworthy of the God who made it, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be pious. It is pious to breathe ardent de&s;ires of the glories of heaven: but there is no piety in &s;ullen contempt of tho&s;e benefits which the God of heaven &s;howers down upon the earth. Heavenly-mindedne&s;s is a noble temper; it refines and exalts the &s;oul: but chagrin and di&s;&s;atisfaction with the world, is a pitiful di&s;po&s;ition which contracts and &s;ours the &s;pirit, and produces many vices. To blacken human life, is to defame its Author; it ob&s;tructs re&s;ignation to his will; and is in|compatible with gratitude for his mercies. The deficiencies of this life are numerous and great enough to intimate that man is intended for a better life: but if this life were a &s;eries of unmixt di&s;tre&s;&s;es, where would be the evi|dence of that divine goodne&s;s which alone can &s;upport the hope of a better? The ine|qualities of the pre&s;ent &s;tate are &s;uch as re|quire a future retribution: but if it be ab&s;o|lute confu&s;ion, without a mark of wi&s;e or righteous government, it can afford no proof of that ju&s;tice, from which only a retribution can proceed. When the Scripture a&s;&s;erts that life is <HI>vanity,</HI> it means not that it is altoge|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">her &s;orrow, or void of all enjoyment: on the

contrary, both by its precepts, and by the examples of the Saints, it teaches us, that in every &s;tate we may <HI>be content</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv. 11.</NOTE>, that in the wor&s;t &s;ituation we may <HI>be patient</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. v. 7, -11.</NOTE>, that <HI>all the days of our appointed time</HI> we may <HI>wait, till our change come</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xiv. 14.</NOTE>. When old age, with a&s;|&s;umed authority, preaches to youth, that life contains nothing at all worth &s;eeking after, it only utters its own regret that life is over. Undi&s;tingui&s;hing cen&s;ures of the condition of man, always are either the murmurings of di&s;content, or the unfelt language of affec|tation. They have no &s;anction from genuine experience. Each of you has had many griefs; but each of you has likewi&s;e had many joys. If a moment of deep di&s;tre&s;s ob|literates the &s;en&s;e of former plea&s;ures, a mo|ment of gladne&s;s bani&s;hes the remembrance of pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. If the memory of &s;ome great affliction recurs at intervals for years, and occa&s;ions hours of &s;ighing, yet with the&s;e are mingled days of ea&s;e, and even of cheerful|ne&s;s. Afflictions which, we think at their fir&s;t on&s;et, mu&s;t put a period to our earthly comfort, are &s;o much mellowed by time, as to become very tolerable, and to admit the part|ner&s;hip of many plea&s;ures. Under the acute|ne&s;s of bodily pain, the pangs of di&s;ap|pointment,
<PB N="107" REF="112">
the angui&s;h of grief, the heart can find no peace: but in the life of every man, how &s;mall a proportion have the mo|ments thus embittered, born to his happier days? It is not more certain that this world cannot &s;atisfy all our de&s;ires, than that it gra|tifies many of them. Let us not di&s;&s;emble the favours of our Maker; let us not unthank|fully vilify the enjoyments which he be&s;tows; let us not fretfully aggravate the evils which he has mingled in the cup of life. If the heart can really go along with the over|charged de&s;criptions of unalleviated mi&s;ery, in which ill-humour indulges it&s;elf, they will corrupt it. If they can make any determinate impre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be a bad impre&s;&s;ion. In con&s;equence of it, that de&s;ire which God hath made the &s;tronge&s;t in our nature, would ap|pear to be an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity; it would &s;eem to be at variance with our whole condi|tion. We mu&s;t fall into &s;tupid indifference, &s;ullen di&s;gu&s;t, or dejecting tiredne&s;s of life. The&s;e are di&s;po&s;itions which religion repro|bates. It acknowledges only &s;uch moderation in the love of life, as the ju&s;t e&s;timate of it can authorize.</P>
<P>WE may con&s;ider life as it really is, we may even turn up its faire&s;t &s;ide, and yet find abundant rea&s;on both for checking the ardor

and for contracting the limits of our de&s;ire of life.&mdash;This life cannot be a &s;tate of <HI>perfect</HI> enjoyment. It is not adequate to the capacity of the &s;oul; it nece&s;&s;arily leaves a &s;en&s;e of deficience, which would require &s;omething nobler to fill it up. We wi&s;h to vary our enjoyments: but the number of them is li|mited, and their frequent recurrence begets &s;atiety. Mo&s;t of them grow fir&s;t in&s;ipid, and then di&s;ta&s;teful. What gave us plea&s;ure by its pre&s;ence, we often de&s;pi&s;e upon reflexion. Our reli&s;h varies; what at one time attached us to life, a little after we count of no value. It is lawful to de&s;ire life for the &s;ake of its enjoyments; but becau&s;e its enjoyments are, to our experience, imperfect, it mu&s;t be unrea|&s;onable to de&s;ire it with anxiety, or to wi&s;h to protract it to its extreme&s;t length.&mdash;This life cannot be a &s;tate even of <HI>pure</HI> enjoyment. Its &s;un&s;hine is broken by many intervals of rain and tempe&s;t. Unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, pain of body, and di&s;tre&s;s in outward circum|&s;tances, make weeping often &s;uddenly to fol|low laughter. The heart &s;ometimes feels plea&s;ure and pain at once: it regrets one want, while it rejoices in the &s;upply of ano|ther; it fears one evil, while it exults in hav|ing e&s;caped another; it mourns for a dead friend in the very hour in which it indulges gaietywith the living. The mo&s;t fortunate have
<PB N="109" REF="114">
their di&s;agreeable moments: and multitudes are vi&s;ited with afflictions &s;evere, frequent, and la&s;ting. The &s;oul pants for unmingled joy; but this world affords it not: and can it be rea&s;onable to exceed in fondne&s;s for a &s;tate in which di&s;appointment is inevitable? Were you permitted to live your pa&s;t life over again, each of you would wi&s;h for an exception of &s;ome particulars: and if you &s;hould live twenty years longer, you would as little be content to tread again the &s;ame unvaried &s;teps. Ima|gination paints flattering pro&s;pects of the future, which inflame the de&s;ire of living on: but if they were examined by the &s;tandard of the pa&s;t, they would lo&s;e a great part of their power.&mdash;Nothing, on account of which you can be anxious to live, is <HI>certain.</HI> You wi&s;h to accompli&s;h a favourite de&s;ign: but you may live, and yet not accompli&s;h it; and you may accompli&s;h it, and find little joy in it.

they felt it. Every hope that can enamour you of life, is precarious: can it then ju&s;tify very earne&s;t wi&s;hes to prolong your days? By the unalterable decree of Heaven life is &s;hort; the utmo&s;t remainder, therefore, of your life cannot de&s;erve great &s;olicitude: and when it has &s;o large a mixture of vanity, need we re|pine at the decree?

<P>THE happie&s;t among mankind will not &s;ay, that this repre&s;entation of the vanity of human life is beyond the truth.

This repre&s;entation will not &s;ugge&s;t an attempt to extirpate the de&s;ire of life: but it will enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of mo|derating it. It will di&s;po&s;e us, neither to be impatient for the hour of our departure, nor to repine becau&s;e we mu&s;t &s;oon depart. Con|tent to live as long as God plea&s;es, we &s;hall willingly obey his call to re&s;ign our breath. Thankful for life while it continues, we &s;hall feel the approaches of death without dejec|tion. The mea&s;ure of our days we &s;hall, without carefulne&s;s, refer to the will of God.</P>

the wi&s;h for length of days, which &s;wells into fervour in the brea&s;t of the young and the pro|&s;perous, it is always tacitly a part, to continue in health, at ea&s;e, full of &s;pirits, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a quick reli&s;h for enjoyment. This implication renders the wi&s;h chimerical. It is not &s;uch an old age that is allotted to human creatures. Youth nece&s;&s;arily fades like the flower of the field: years give every thing a very dif|ferent a&s;pect. Old age is the dregs of a turbid cup. If you live long, you can expect only &s;uch a life as falls to the &s;hare of man. If that be not highly eligible, you cannot rea&s;on|ably be anxious for it.</P>
<P>EVEN this darke&s;t period of life is &s;ome|times relieved by &s;treaks of &s;hining light. Now and then you meet an aged per&s;on who retains con&s;iderable health and vigour, and a capa|city for many &s;atisfactions. You &s;ee one who&s;e weakne&s;s, if it has rendered his enjoy|ments languid, has likewi&s;e rendered his pains gentle. You find one whom a happy tempe|rature has pre&s;erved fit for receiving and com|municating plea&s;ure in the cheerful inter|cour&s;e of &s;ociety.

looking back, is con&s;cious of a well-&s;pent life; and looking forward, e&s;pies a crown of glory prepared for him; who, in the thought that his labours are nearly pa&s;t, and his reward at hand, ta&s;tes more &s;olid and &s;ublime delight, than in all the plea&s;ures of youth; who even rejoices in his infirmities, as the indications of his having reached the gates of immortality. But it is only one from among many aged per&s;ons, that falls under any of the&s;e de&s;crip|tions. What may be ju&s;tly called <HI>a good old age</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxv. 8.</NOTE>, is generally good, only in compari&s;on with the old age of other men: compared with the earlier periods of life, its days are al|mo&s;t always <HI>the evil days</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. xii. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I WILL not repre&s;ent old age in its mo&s;t frightful forms.

I will not remind you of the mon&s;ter who continues to hold fa&s;t the &s;ins of his youth; who is racked by de&s;ires which indulgence has rendered importunate, but which decay has di&s;qualified him for gratify|ing; who, &s;unk into decrepitude, glories in

the former abu&s;es of his &s;trength, and delights in recounting the &s;ins which long ago &s;hould have covered him with &s;hame, and produced bitter repentance. I will not de&s;cribe the man who&s;e avarice grows, as the time in which he can enjoy his riches becomes le&s;s. I will not even enlarge on the peevi&s;hne&s;s, the fret|fulne&s;s, the &s;u&s;piciou&s;ne&s;s, the cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;everity, which often come on with years; which chace away the young from the &s;ociety of the aged, and render the attentions of their very children an irk&s;ome ta&s;k. All the&s;e are the <HI>vices</HI> of old age: and if you be &s;olicitous to live long, you &s;hould be equally &s;olicitous to be virtuous, were it only that, by vice, you latter days may not become in any of the&s;e ways contemptible and wretched.</P>
<P>BUT you mu&s;t expect that your old age will be ju&s;t like that of mo&s;t other men, comfortle&s;s in many re&s;pects. Old age cannot but have fewer enjoyments and more pains than the prime of life. It has rendered the organs callous to the impre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure; and by frequent repetitions the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions have become faint.

<P>HOPE of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of heaven is the chief joy of the good man; but during this life it can be only hope; and is it rea&s;on|able to wi&s;h earne&s;tly that, by the prolonga|tion of this life, it may be retarded from ripen|ing into fruition? Is it not de&s;ireable that our perfect happine&s;s begin as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible? Can it be wi&s;e to &s;hew anxiety for po&s;tponing it? Does the exile ever wi&s;h that

The &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tinct would &s;eem too weak to prevent our becoming impatient for the ac|compli&s;hment of &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a hope. But, alas! we are not careful to live in &s;uch a manner as may render it certain that heaven will be our portion after death: and therefore we cling to life with all its mi&s;eries, through dread of exchanging it for the incomparably greater mi&s;eries of eternity. But if we are obnoxious to the&s;e, the longe&s;t life would be a reprieve too in&s;ignificant to de&s;erve a wi&s;h. Our only &s;ecurity is in immediate reformation.

<P>THUS, the nature of the pre&s;ent life, the ordinary attendants of long life, and the happine&s;s of the future life, form together a &s;trong argument for moderating our de&s;ire of length of days; for they concur in forcing us
<PB N="120" REF="125">
to feel that, con&s;ider it in what light we will, it is not worthy of vehement de&s;ire.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The de&s;ire of long life, when &s;uffered to become immoderate, is <HI>pernicious,</HI> as well as unrea&s;onable: it is a &s;ource of pain,&mdash;it leads us to delay our preparation for eter|nity,&mdash;and it renders our preparation more difficult.</P>
<P>1. THE de&s;ire of life, allowed to become immoderate, is a &s;ource of pain and di&s;quiet. Every exorbitant de&s;ire creates unea&s;ine&s;s and anxiety; but the exorbitant de&s;ire of life, is of all the mo&s;t tormenting. Life is a complex object, including all the particular goods on which other de&s;ires are fixt: the de&s;ire of it agitates the &s;oul with violence proportioned to its moment. The di&s;appointment of other de&s;ires is but the lo&s;s of &s;ome one thing: the di&s;appointment of this de&s;ire is the lo&s;s of our all in the pre&s;ent world. The lo&s;s of one enjoyment is alleviated by the hope or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others: but the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing life, admits no alleviation; it is the apprehen&s;ion of being deprived of all &s;ublu|nary enjoyments at once. All earthly things are precarious; the de&s;ires of them mu&s;t be embittered by frequent fears: but of all things life is the mo&s;t precarious; every day alarms
<PB N="121" REF="126">
us with examples of its uncertainty; if we in|dulge exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for it, we mu&s;t, <HI>through fear of death, be all our life-time &s;ubject to bon|dage</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE>. Other de&s;ires may be gratified: the de&s;ire of life is &s;ingular in this, that it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be gratified; its object is the future, it is, to live &s;till longer; if we &s;hould live a hundred years, at la&s;t it mu&s;t be fru&s;trated. Why &s;hould we indulge a de&s;ire fitted, &s;o much beyond all others, for involving us in unea|&s;ine&s;s, &s;ubjecting us to fears, and plunging us into inevitable di&s;appointment? If you have indulged it, your&s;elves know what di&s;quiet it creates. A thought of the &s;hortne&s;s and un|certainty of human life is hara&s;&s;ing to you. The death of a contemporary plants a dag|ger in your heart. A &s;ituation of hazard confounds all the powers of your nature, and wrings you with angui&s;h. The &s;lighte&s;t ail|ment, your timidity magnifies into a threaten|ing di&s;temper: you feel the remote&s;t beginnings of &s;ickne&s;s with trepidation, le&s;t it &s;hould prove mortal. Rid your&s;elves of the&s;e unavailing torments. Conquer your fond &s;olicitude for life. Then &s;hall you fully reli&s;h it, while it is continued, without abatement from the dread of di&s;&s;olution. Then &s;hall you bear the &s;en&s;e of its brevity, without di&s;turbing your &s;ere|nity.
<PB N="122" REF="127">
Knowing that you may die to-morrow, you &s;hall neverthele&s;s enjoy this day. Nei|ther wi&s;hing for long life, nor reckoning on it, you &s;hall be exempt from the po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;appointment. You &s;hall rejoice in every day as a new gift from God: and if your days are multiplied, you &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of living beyond your wi&s;h or expec|tation.</P>
<P>2. THE immoderate de&s;ire of life, not only eats out our pre&s;ent comfort, but oc|ca&s;ions the delay of that preparation for eter|nity, on which our future happine&s;s depends. That we may prepare our&s;elves for eternity, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we think of it. But at|tachment to life, renders the thought of leav|ing life a torment, and di&s;po&s;es us to bani&s;h it as often as it is &s;ugge&s;ted. We flee to di&s;|&s;ipation or to bu&s;ine&s;s; we become continually more aver&s;e to preparation for our great change. We ea&s;ily believe what we ardently de&s;ire; our fondne&s;s for long life begets the expectation of it. We promi&s;e our&s;elves the greate&s;t length of days that man can reach. When we have approached to it, we &s;eem to be per&s;uaded that we &s;hall overleap the utmo&s;t limits of the <HI>time appointed to man upon earth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 1.</NOTE>.
<PB N="123" REF="128">
We flatter our&s;elves that full &s;pace remains for the nece&s;&s;ary preparation: we therefore &s;till go on to neglect it for the pre&s;ent: death arre&s;ts us before we have &s;et about it, and conveys us into the man&s;ions of woe. But by moderating our love of life, we &s;hall be able to bear the thought of dying: many oc|ca&s;ions will &s;ugge&s;t it, and we &s;hall willingly embrace them. That thought, often pre&s;ent, will in&s;tigate us to make immediate prepara|tion. We &s;hall live always, &s;o as to be always fit to die.</P>
<P>3. THE immoderate love of life renders our preparation for death more difficult. Attachment to life, and attachment to the good things of life, mutually &s;upport and &s;trengthen one another. Ambition, avarice, &s;en&s;uality, inflame the love of life; for without our living, they cannot be gratified. They are in their turn inflamed by it. The more anxious we are for life, the higher value we mu&s;t &s;et upon tho&s;e things which ren|der it agreeable. But the mortification of fle&s;hly and worldly lu&s;ts is a great part of our preparation for death. How can that man be fit to leave this world for ever, who doats upon tho&s;e things which he mu&s;t for ever leave along with it? Such lu&s;ts are not only vici|ous, but likewi&s;e the great &s;ources of all other
<PB N="124" REF="129">
vices; they cheri&s;h the habit, they impel to the practice, they impede the relinqui&s;hment, of all that wickedne&s;s which renders us in every re&s;pect unprepared for the &s;tate of re|tribution, incapable of the favour of God, unfit for the enjoyment of him, meet only for the day of vengeance. Like noxious weeds, they cumber the &s;oul, choak the &s;eeds of goodne&s;s, and prevent its growth: and they entangle us in pur&s;uits incon&s;i&s;tent with that diligence in well-doing, which alone can form us to virtue, and qualify us for eternal happi|ne&s;s. But if the man who fondly hugs the pre&s;ent life, be called to hazard it in holding fa&s;t his integrity, how difficult mu&s;t he find it to obey the call? Unable to reconcile him&s;elf to the thought of re&s;igning this life, he is in the extreme&s;t danger of forfeiting all the in|tere&s;ts of the next, by a timid apo&s;tacy from virtue. It is madne&s;s, by fo&s;tering an immo|derate de&s;ire, &s;o much to increa&s;e the difficulty of what is in it&s;elf difficult enough, the at|tainment of purity and holine&s;s &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h us for the everla&s;ting pre&s;ence of the all-perfect God. Where the love of life is moderate, the love of the world can &s;carcely become extravagant: in proportion as that is conquered, earthly affections will of cour&s;e decline; our temptations will become fewer and le&s;s powerful; our reformation, our im|provement,
<PB N="125" REF="130">
and our progre&s;s will be facilitated and accelerated.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations I have &s;ugge&s;ted, in order to excite you to moderate the de&s;ire of prolonging life. I have proved that long life is in many re&s;pects unde&s;ireable. The vanity of life, the increa&s;e of vanity in its later pe|riods, and the excellence of that &s;tate from which the protraction of it detains us, at once evince that exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for it is unrea|&s;onable, and impre&s;s &s;entiments fit for check|ing and correcting it. They are arguments for our &s;etting our&s;elves to &s;ubdue it, and they are the direct means by which it may be &s;ubdued.&mdash;I have likewi&s;e proved that the ex|ce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of life produces the mo&s;t perni|cious con&s;equences. The&s;e both excite and direct our efforts to &s;ubdue it: they not only urge us to re&s;train it, but at the &s;ame time in|dicate the exce&s;&s;es from which it needs to be re&s;trained. It is not to be extirpated; but it mu&s;t be rendered con&s;i&s;tent with compo&s;ure and &s;erenity in a full view of the &s;hortne&s;s and precariou&s;ne&s;s of this mortal &s;tate; con|&s;i&s;tent with our willingly dwelling on the con&s;ideration of our latter end, and our ap|plying our&s;elves readily to make preparation for it; and con&s;i&s;tent with that di&s;engaged|ne&s;s from the things of time, that purity from
<PB N="126" REF="131">
worldly lu&s;ts, and that con&s;tancy in holy practice, which are requi&s;ite for our being ca|pable of happine&s;s after death.&mdash;I plead not for a &s;tupid indifference to life, a &s;ullen di&s;|dain of it, or a peevi&s;h impatience for death; to the&s;e religion gives no countenance: I plead only for &s;uch moderation in the love of it, as &s;uits its real value, as fits the de&s;ire of life for an&s;wering its end, as prevents the abu&s;e of this pa&s;&s;ion from defeating, or even rever&s;ing, the benefits of which it was intended to be pro|ductive; and in &s;trongly inculcating this, rea|&s;on and religion con&s;pire. But that we may be able to li&s;ten to them, we mu&s;t without delay <HI>fly for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 18.</NOTE>; we mu&s;t, by an effectual reforma|tion, and by unwearied diligence and con&s;tant improvement in all goodne&s;s, <HI>make our calling and election &s;ure</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 10.</NOTE>. Though an ardent pa&s;|&s;ion for the pre&s;ent life can never be but un|rea&s;onable and hurtful, yet it can never be|come rea&s;onable, and is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, for the wicked man to avoid it. De&s;titute of all good hope beyond the grave, terrified with di&s;mal forebodings of wretchedne&s;s, he loves life far beyond his own opinion of its value, he clings to it even while he nau|&s;eates it, he pants for it while he knows

not how to bear it. In this, as well as in every other re&s;pect, wickedne&s;s intangles men in palpable ab&s;urdity, and en&s;nares them in acknowledged incon&s;i&s;tence. Speedily there|fore abandon wickedne&s;s; for till you have abandoned it, all your &s;entiments and con|duct mu&s;t be contradiction and perplexity; to think or to act rationally, properly, or wi&s;ely, will not be in your power.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON V. THE NATURE OF SOUND DOC|TRINE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>TITUS ii. 1.</BIBL>
 But &s;peak thou the things which become &s;ound doctrine.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOUND doctrine is an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o com|monly u&s;ed by Chri&s;tians, that few are apt to &s;u&s;pect any ambiguity in its mean|ing. Every one of tho&s;e &s;ects into which the Chri&s;tian world is unhappily divided, applies the expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ignify the whole of its own &s;y&s;tem of doctrine, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;peculative and di&s;putable tenets which di&s;tingui&s;h it from other &s;ects, and even tho&s;e technical terms which it has coined or adopted on purpo&s;e to define them with preci&s;ion. All &s;ects, with equal confidence, appropriate the epithet to their own peculiar &s;y&s;tems: yet the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets of different &s;ects
<PB N="130" REF="134">
are contradictory&punc; It is certain, therefore, that the epithet is mi&s;applied by &s;ome of them. Each affirms, that it is mi&s;applied by all except its own adherents: and as the theological &s;y&s;tem of every &s;ect contains &s;omething of human, and con&s;equently fallible, explication, impartiality can &s;carce avoid &s;u&s;pecting that the epithet is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, mi&s;applied by all &s;ects. It will not therefore be &s;uper|fluous, profe&s;&s;edly to a&s;certain and illu&s;trate its genuine import.</P>
<P>WITH this view, I &s;hall, FIRST, examine its preci&s;e meaning in Scripture;</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Explain the &s;everal particulars which &s;hall, from that examination, appear to be implied in it; and,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Conclude with &s;ome reflexions naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>SOUND <HI>doctrine, &s;ound or whole&s;ome words, &s;ound &s;peech, &s;ound in the faith,</HI> are all expre&s;|&s;ions found in Scripture, and evidently in|tended to convey the &s;ame idea. The origi|nal words which expre&s;s the epithet in all the&s;e phra&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one text, the adjective <GAP DESC="foreign">; in another, the verb <GAP DESC="foreign">; in all the re&s;t, the participle <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, refer primarily to bodily health,
<PB N="131" REF="135">
as oppo&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;e: but they are, by cla&s;|&s;ical writers, u&s;ed with great latitude, for &s;ig|nifying metaphorically whatever is right or approveable. They are all words of the &s;ame etymology. One of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">&punc;</NOTE> primarily &s;ignifies <HI>healthful,</HI> but is al&s;o u&s;ed by Greek authors, to &s;ignify <HI>healing, whole&s;ome,</HI> or conducive to health. Another of them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">&punc;</NOTE> &s;ignifies, mo&s;t li|terally, <HI>healing,</HI> but is u&s;ed likewi&s;e, in &s;everal places of the new Te&s;tament <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke v. 31. vii. 10 xv. 27.</NOTE>, to &s;ignify <HI>healthful.</HI> We may conclude, therefore, that they are de&s;igned to be &s;ynonymous when they are applied to doctrine, and to denote &s;uch as is healthful, or &s;uch as is healing, or &s;uch as unites both the&s;e characters. What they preci&s;ely denote, we &s;hall be be&s;t able to determine, by comparing the pa&s;&s;ages in which they occur, and examining the &s;cope and connexion of each. All the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages lie in Paul's epi&s;tles to Timothy and to Titus: and, from the &s;lighte&s;t attention to them, it will, I think, be evident, that the Apo&s;tle calls doctrine <HI>&s;ound,</HI> in a &s;en&s;e very remote from that in which the term is u&s;ed by the di&s;cordant &s;ects of Chri&s;tians; that he con|&s;tantly means it to expre&s;s both the ideas which it naturally &s;ignifies; that he intends the genuine doctrine of Chri&s;t, but with a par|ticular
<PB N="132" REF="136">
reference, both to its being <HI>healthful,</HI> pure, and un&s;ophi&s;ticated, and to its being whole&s;ome or <HI>healing,</HI> as having a practical tendency. So far is he from de&s;igning it to denote the peculiarities of any human &s;y&s;tem, that, on the contrary, he is at pains to intimate, that he de&s;igns it to expre&s;s the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of the doctrine of the go&s;pel, as de|livered by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, in direct oppo&s;ition to the precarious opinions, the &s;ub|tile explications and definitions, the ingenious &s;peculations and refinements of unin&s;pired men: and &s;o far is he from applying the term to any curious or intricate theory, that he no le&s;s clearly and con&s;tantly intimates that, by calling doctrine <HI>&s;ound,</HI> he means to expre&s;s its being fit to cure the di&s;ea&s;es, and promote the health, of the &s;oul; and that, in oppo&s;ition not only to tenets directly immoral, but par|ticularly al&s;o to the inutility and pernicious tendency of all &s;ubtile que&s;tions and ab&s;tract di&s;qui&s;itions. The&s;e two ideas, by which the Apo&s;tle characterizes <HI>&s;ound</HI> doctrine, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to trace out jointly; for, in every pa&s;&s;age of his writings, they are jointly kept in view with the greate&s;t care.</P>
<P>OUR Apo&s;tle u&s;es the term <HI>&s;ound</HI> doc|trine, in 1 Tim. i. 10. He immediately &s;ub|joins a definition of it: it is what is <HI>according</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="137">
<HI>to the glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, which,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>was committed to my tru&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11.</NOTE>; it is what is plainly and expre&s;sly revealed by God in the go&s;pel.

To perceive this, we mu&s;t look back to the beginning of the paragraph, ver. 3. The Apo&s;tle there reminds Timothy, that he had formerly de&s;ired him to <HI>charge &s;ome that they teach no</HI> OTHER <HI>doctrine:</HI> OTHER, he can only mean, than the doctrine of the go&s;pel, which he had preached.

that &s;implicity and moral tendency which be|long to the true faith; for, in exhorting Timo|thy to oppo&s;e it by <HI>good doctrine</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 6.</NOTE>, he gives him this direction, <HI>Refu&s;e profane and old wives fables, and exerci&s;e thy&s;elf unto godline&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, chap. vi. 3. he &s;peaks again of <HI>whole|&s;ome</HI> or <HI>&s;ound words;</HI> for, in the original, the epithet is the &s;ame which he had formerly applied to doctrine. What the&s;e were, he immediately explains, <HI>Even the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the go&s;pel in the &s;implicity in which it was at fir&s;t delivered; and <HI>the doc|trine which is according to godline&s;s:</HI> thus &s;tudi|ou&s;ly unfolding and forcing into view both the ideas which we have affirmed to be implied in the epithet. If farther evidence of this be nece&s;&s;ary, the whole context will abundantly &s;upply it. He in&s;inuates, that &s;ome <HI>con&s;ent not to the whole&s;ome words,</HI> but <HI>teach otherwi&s;e.</HI> Otherwi&s;e than what? Certainly one of two things.

had immediately before been wholly occupied in giving plain practical directions concerning the particular duties incumbent on Timothy him&s;elf, on widows, and on &s;ervants. Or, <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> otherwi&s;e than was required by the general de&s;criptions which the Apo&s;tle had formerly given of Chri&s;tian doctrine: and that the&s;e had been anxiou&s;ly contrived to mark e&s;pecially both its practical tendency and its &s;implicity in oppo&s;ition to all human &s;pecu|lations and opinions, is evident from the pa&s;|&s;age which we have already explained, and might be confirmed by other pa&s;&s;ages. The apo&s;tle's idea of <HI>&s;ound words</HI> is farther a&s;cer|tained by the character which he gives of the man who deviates from them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 4, 5.</NOTE>: <HI>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doating,</HI> ailing, di&s;ea&s;ed, <HI>about que&s;tions and &s;trifes of words.</HI> It is a fal&s;e conceit of his own acutene&s;s and inge|nuity which impels him to &s;ubtilize on the plain doctrines of the go&s;pel; and his doing &s;o betrays his total ignorance of their genuine nature, and is truly a di&s;tempered appetite for enquiries, di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and definitions, which, profound or important as he imagines them, are in fact trifling or unintelligible logomachies, at the be&s;t controver&s;ies not about truth it&s;elf, but about particular modes of expre&s;&s;ing it,

It will not perhaps be a blameable minutene&s;s to remark farther, that in this pa&s;&s;age it is the WORDS of Chri&s;t, not his DOCTRINE as in the former pa&s;&s;age, that the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>&s;ound;</HI> on purpo&s;e, it would &s;eem, to intimate, that the words of Scripture are the mo&s;t proper for expre&s;&s;ing the doctrine of Scripture; that the &s;ub&s;titution of other terms, as more explicit and preci&s;e, and fitter for di&s;tingui&s;hing the truth from error, is really a deviation from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and a certain means of introducing human refinements, and rai&s;ing vain and &s;ubtile que&s;|tions heterogeneous to its nature and de&s;ign. At any rate, the Apo&s;tle's anxiety to condemn

the&s;e is plain and undeniable; for returning to this &s;ubject, he concludes the epi&s;tle with an earne&s;t exhortation to beware of them: <HI>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy tru&s;t, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppo&s;i|tions of &s;cience fal&s;ely &s;o called; which &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ing, have erred concerning the faith</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>

They approved all the &s;ubtleties, re|finements, and inventions of one party; adopt|ed whatever hard words and technical terms they thought fitte&s;t for di&s;criminating them from tho&s;e of the other party; and by a decree of u&s;urped, but formidable authority, they determined all the&s;e to be articles of faith, and their cho&s;en terms of art to be the te&s;t of the truth. All who refu&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their impo&s;itions, they condemned as adherents to the contrary party, and &s;tigmatized as here|tics; and they reviled, anathematized, excom|municated, and, whenever they could get the civil power to enter into their re&s;entments, per&s;ecuted, bani&s;hed, or put them to death.

By the rage of controver&s;y, and the &s;pirit of faction in all, the Chri&s;tian church was di|vided, and &s;ubdivided, and again and again &s;ubdivided into fects innumerable, hating and execrating one another; but di&s;tingui&s;hed only by verbal differences, or by notions of none of which the Scripture affirms any thing, or of which the human faculties can form no clear conception, and of which any conception or thought at all is both unnece&s;|&s;ary and unprofitable.</P>

BY &s;uch <HI>oppo&s;itions</HI> and contentions <HI>of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called,</HI> continued and increa&s;ing through many ages of intellectual darkne&s;s, the doctrine of the papal church became a huge body of tenets, un&s;cripturally conceived and expre&s;&s;ed, and many of them, not only de&s;titute of all foundation in the go&s;pel, but directly repugnant to it. The Reformers, rai&s;ed up in a ble&s;&s;ed hour for that very pur|po&s;e, unveiled this ma&s;s of corruption, expo&s;ed the perver&s;ions of the go&s;pel which compo&s;ed it, and the fables which it had &s;uperadded to the go&s;pel. They pronounced the Scripture to be the only rule of faith, and di&s;claimed all human definitions of its &s;imple principles. Happy had it been if they had per&s;i&s;ted &s;ted|dily in this. But their adver&s;aries demanded, what it was preci&s;ely that they believed; they declared an appeal to Scripture in&s;ufficient for fixing this, becau&s;e the authority of its words was pled by all &s;ides; they cried out that the doctrine of Prote&s;tants was altogether indefi|nite and uncertain; they mi&s;repre&s;ented it gro&s;sly; they called upon them to publi&s;h it in determinate language. Overcome by the&s;e im|portunities, clamours, and accu&s;ations, and not perfectly cured of the &s;ubtilizing &s;pirit from which they &s;prung, Prote&s;tants were led un|warily, though at fir&s;t reluctantly, to accept the challenge. The earlie&s;t explications of

their doctrine were tolerably &s;imple; the &s;cho|la&s;tic mode of arrangement, argument, and expre&s;&s;ion, was in general rather avoided than affected: but the &s;pirit of ab&s;traction gradu|ally acquired &s;trength and violence; the ex|plications of doctrine given by &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ed others; oppo&s;ite explications were propo&s;ed; que&s;tions about them were agitated; they were pu&s;hed to greater and greater degrees of &s;ub|tlety; all the harde&s;t words of the &s;chools were borrowed for expre&s;&s;ing the differences of opi|nion; and all the mo&s;t frivolous or unintelli|gible di&s;tinctions of the &s;chools were employed in debating them. Prote&s;tants were crumbled down into numberle&s;s &s;ects, di&s;tingui&s;hed by peculiarities of belief upon points unnece&s;&s;ary or impo&s;&s;ible to be determined. Creeds were oppo&s;ed to creeds; &s;y&s;tems were multiplied again&s;t &s;y&s;tems; &s;ome on all &s;ides, not &s;o much &s;y&s;tems of Chri&s;tian theology, as metaphy&s;ical &s;y&s;tems of verbal, &s;peculative, ab&s;tru&s;e, unim|portant controver&s;ies, for which a handle was taken from that theology.

<P>SUCH is the general portrait of the departure of the Chri&s;tians from <HI>the</HI> SIMPLICITY <HI>of &s;ound doctrine:</HI> every part of it might ea&s;ily be con|firmed
<PB N="159" REF="165">
by numberle&s;s facts in the hi&s;tory of the church. Not content with thus departing from it, they have &s;ub&s;tituted the very deviation in its place, and given it its name. Every party appropriates the name of &s;ound doctrine to tho&s;e peculiar explications, &s;peculations, and definitions which characterize it&s;elf, and di&s;|criminate it, and &s;et it at the greate&s;t di&s;|tance from all other parties: but the&s;e the Apo&s;tle expre&s;sly, and in terms of abhorrence, excludes from the idea of &s;ound doctrine, and urges Chri&s;tians to avoid as repugnant to it. What the &s;everal &s;ects have extolled as the &s;ounde&s;t doctrine is, therefore, in the Apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e, mo&s;t un&s;ound. According to his &s;en&s;e of it, the only &s;en&s;e which merits the regard of Chri&s;tians, the bigot of every denomination, the tenacious partizan of any &s;ect, nece&s;&s;arily deviates in &s;ome degree, and generally deviates the farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>3. SOUND <HI>doctrine</HI> means <HI>practical</HI> doctrine. The Apo&s;tle &s;tudiou&s;ly and con&s;tantly connects this idea with the former; and they are in their nature intimately connected. All ab&s;tract defi|nitions of doctrine, all ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions about it, are in their very e&s;&s;ence wholly &s;peculative; they are at be&s;t fit only for informing the un|der&s;tanding, too often only for perplexing it: their natural effects are thorny di&s;putes, con|tentions,

divi&s;ions, not the active exertions of Chri&s;tian virtue and holine&s;s: <HI>Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 16.</NOTE>? The utmo&s;t they can claim is, that they may be harmle&s;sly amu&s;ing: they never can be profitable, If it were po&s;&s;ible to determine them with the greate&s;t clearne&s;s and certainty, yet they could not influence practice. Ab&s;tract ideas are too frigid to warm the heart; too weak to draw out good affections; too dim to be kept in view in the moment of action. They are al|ways in danger of becoming hurtful: the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of them excites pa&s;&s;ions de&s;tructive of mutual love; attachment to them diverts men's attention from applying faith to practice; it leads them to lay too little &s;tre&s;s on practice, and too much upon opinion. Many que&s;tions have even i&s;&s;ued in deci&s;ions, on one &s;ide at lea&s;t, &s;ometimes on both &s;ides, directly favour|able to immorality. Some of the real doc|trines of the holy go&s;pel have been &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented in &s;ome pretended explications of them, as to be twi&s;ted into unholy principles of impurity and vice: and to the real doc|trines of the go&s;pel, &s;purious doctrines have been &s;uperadded in &s;ome &s;y&s;tems profe&s;&s;ing to be Chri&s;tian, which by their nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quences make void all moral obligation; and
<PB N="161" REF="167">
this &s;o plainly, that their partizans find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;claim con&s;equences which they cannot refute, and to throw in cautions, ca|veats, and di&s;tinctions, for rendering them, not conducive to, but barely con&s;i&s;tent with, good practice, and which will always be forgotten or di&s;regarded in the hour of temptation. Yet, by the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and the profane&s;t abu&s;e of words, tenets and explications, in their tendency immoral, are, by tho&s;e who hold them, pronounced the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to &s;ound doctrine, the mo&s;t evangelical, the mo&s;t ho|nourable to the grace of the go&s;pel: But &s;o far are they from being &s;ound, that they are in the very wor&s;t &s;en&s;e CONTRARY <HI>to &s;ound doc|trine;</HI> &s;o far from being whole&s;ome, that how|ever fairly they be gilded over, however &s;peci|ou&s;ly they be di&s;gui&s;ed, they are poi&s;on.</P>
<P>No opinion can be a Chri&s;tian doctrine, who&s;e direct and primary tendency is not to holine&s;s. God gave a Revelation of the truth for this very purpo&s;e, by it to purify and im|prove the hearts, and to direct and influence the practice of men. Every part of it is im|mediately and powerfully conducive to this purpo&s;e: all the precepts of the go&s;pel, and all its principles con&s;pire in promoting it. The former pre&s;cribe the pure&s;t and the &s;ublime&s;t virtue: The latter are even more directly &s;ub|&s;ervient
<PB N="162" REF="168">
to it, they excite to that virtue. They delineate tho&s;e qualities, characters, and rela|tions of per&s;ons and objects, which are fit for producing right affections, and prompting to right practice towards them: but of tho&s;e which, though they were known, could con|tribute nothing to this effect, the Scripture takes no notice. For temper and action, it is not an apprehen&s;ion of an object &s;cientifically ac|curate that is nece&s;&s;ary, but a conception lively, &s;triking, and intere&s;ting: and &s;uch a conception the Scripture is careful to give of all the objects belonging to religion. It &s;ets them only in tho&s;e points of view in which they can enforce piety and goodne&s;s; it is in|tent on &s;etting them in every attitude in which they can mo&s;t &s;trongly enforce the&s;e; and it con&s;tantly and earne&s;tly applies them to this end.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We &s;hall now conclude with &s;ome reflexions naturally ari&s;ing from this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>1. IT appears that the Chri&s;tian church is more clo&s;ely united, in one common faith, in reality than in appearance. In human &s;y&s;tems, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h the principles of doctrine which they imply from the particular manner in which they explain them. In the latter they differ widely; and it, being derived
<PB N="163" REF="169">
from fallible men, may very readily be impro|per or erroneous. In the former they very generally agree; and the former only is either of indubitable certainty or of real importance.</P>
<P>2. LET each of us, for him&s;elf, &s;tudy to ad|here to, and be &s;atisfied with the pure, &s;imple, practical doctrine of Chri&s;t; de&s;pi&s;ing and avoiding all unprofitable que&s;tions and &s;pecu|lative niceties, as ab&s;olutely foreign to it. It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary for us to be wi&s;e above what is written: it is improper to attempt it. It is not needful to have any more preci&s;e, ab|&s;tract, or &s;cientifical conception of the doc|trines of religion, of the my&s;teries of the Chri&s;|tian faith, than the Scripture gives. If we find that conception inadequate, we may be a&s;&s;ured that it is not requi&s;ite, perhaps not po&s;&s;ible, to render it, in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of weakne&s;s, more adequate. Whatever words of human inven|tion pretend to mark it with greater preci&s;ion and force than the words of Scripture, there is always rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, will either di&s;|tort, or add &s;omething to, the original doc|trine of Scripture.</P>
<P>3. LET us carefully attend to the great end of all Chri&s;tian doctrine, namely, holine&s;s of heart and life, our purification from vice, and our improvement in virtue. Let us con&s;tantly repre|&s;ent
<PB N="164" REF="170">

<P>SOME creatures are &s;o entirely a&s;&s;imilated to God, &s;o exten&s;ively acquainted with the ways of his Providence, and &s;o unalterably fixt in perfect happine&s;s, that their acqui|e&s;cence in the will of the Ruler of the univer&s;e, is not &s;o properly re&s;ignation, as gratitude and joy. To give &s;cope for re&s;ignation, &s;ome imperfection of nature, or &s;ome defect in &s;tate, is requi&s;ite; and both the&s;e con&s;pire to give it exerci&s;e in human creatures.&mdash;Our nature is &s;o complicated, our &s;en&s;es and de&s;ires are &s;o various, and often &s;o incompatible, that we cannot, by any means, obtain all po&s;&s;ible gratifications at once. To &s;ecure one, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the want of another: to enjoy plea&s;ure, we mu&s;t forego profit; to accumu|late riches, we mu&s;t forfeit ea&s;e; to the attain|ment of temporal goods, we mu&s;t often &s;acri|fice the &s;atisfactions of virtue and integrity; and not to lo&s;e the&s;e, we mu&s;t re&s;ign many gratifications of &s;en&s;e, appetite, and pa&s;&s;ion. By forming our nature in this manner, God proclaims that we are not made for unallay|ed happine&s;s; lays us under a nece&s;&s;ity of bearing di&s;appointment, and giving up many
<PB N="172" REF="178">
things which would be de&s;ireable; requires us to be content with that mea&s;ure of enjoy|ment, however incomplete, of which he has made us capable, and which he is plea&s;ed at any time to grant us; and prepares us for eagerly embracing the excellencies of his cha|racter and government, as giving ground for our referring our&s;elves to him without re|pining.</P>
<P>OUR &s;tate in this world affords full place for re&s;ignation, and demands the exerci&s;e of it. We mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to want particular ad|vantages which even inferior animals po&s;&s;e&s;s: the &s;trength of the lion, the &s;wiftne&s;s of the hor&s;e, the flight of the eagle, belong not to the condition of our being, and are for ever without our reach. The advantages proper to our condition, are not at all times attain|able; and tho&s;e which we have attained, are not always permanent. We are not placed in a region of continual &s;erenity; we dwell in the land of &s;torms and tempe&s;ts. Our &s;tate is mixt, complicated, and precarious. Becau&s;e our bodies are &s;ubjected to the laws of the material world, and connected with it by manifold relations, our &s;ouls are nece&s;&s;arily affected by its vici&s;&s;itudes. Pain and &s;uffering are in&s;eparable from human life. Pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity unexpectedly &s;ucceed each other
<PB N="173" REF="179">
by quick intervals. In the morning we <HI>know not what the day may bring forth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 1.</NOTE>; and we have neither &s;trength nor wi&s;dom to mould its events according to our wi&s;hes. Our condi|tion depends not wholly on our own behavi|our; God, in token of his &s;overeignty, and for the purpo&s;es of his government, has in a great mea&s;ure re&s;erved to him&s;elf the di&s;po&s;al of our enjoyment and &s;uffering; and fre|quently di&s;pen&s;es them in a manner which appears to us unequal or promi&s;cuous, and of which we can give no account. We feel our|&s;elves ignorant and impotent, unfit for our own direction, unable to accompli&s;h our de&s;ires. While we have no dependence but on our&s;elves, we are orphans expo&s;ed in a &s;trange land, we are travellers &s;olitary and benighted, in a wa&s;te and dreary wilderne&s;s, left to wander in a thou&s;and undi&s;tingui&s;hable by-paths, &s;urrounded with dangers, uncertain but the next &s;tep may lead us to de&s;truction. We are ready to faint under the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es and apprehen&s;ions which pre&s;s upon us. We cannot but wi&s;h for the friendly guidance of &s;uperior wi&s;dom and &s;uperior power. We cannot but learn with plea&s;ure, that there is a God all-good, all-wi&s;e, and all-powerful, who governs the world, in whom we may
<PB N="174" REF="180">
confide, into who&s;e hands we may re&s;ign all our intere&s;ts with unre&s;erved tru&s;t. We natu|rally repo&s;e our&s;elves on him who carries on one fixt and well-contrived plan amid&s;t all the changes and commotions of things, who <HI>&s;it|teth upon the flood</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxix. 10.</NOTE>, <HI>who walketh upon the wings of the wind</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. civ. 3.</NOTE>, who dwelleth in the tempe&s;t, who from darkne&s;s produceth light, and from confu&s;ion bringeth forth order. A firm be|lief and an habitual &s;en&s;e of his wi&s;e and gra|cious, though incomprehen&s;ible, admini&s;tra|tion, is our only adequate &s;upport.</P>
<P>BY the appointment of God, our pre&s;ent life is only a part of our exi&s;tence, an introduc|tion to a future life, &s;ubordinate to eternity. In con&s;equence of this appointment, nothing in our pre&s;ent &s;tate is final; nothing to be regarded only on its own account: every thing has a reference to eternity, and thence derives its real importance. Pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, plea&s;ure and pain, &s;ucce&s;s and di&s;appointment, are but different means of promoting the &s;ame end, but different methods of training us up for immortality. It is in this light that God always con&s;iders our pre&s;ent life, and the &s;everal events which fill it up. Steady in his plan, unmoved either by weak pity or by
<PB N="175" REF="181">
weaker fury, he goes forward in the execution of it, through all the methods of &s;everity and gentlene&s;s, of cha&s;ti&s;ement and reward, of re|&s;traint and encouragement, allotting us &s;uch events as tend mo&s;t, if we duly improve them, to promote our everla&s;ting welfare. In this light we likewi&s;e ought con&s;tantly to view our earthly &s;tate. The view will &s;trengthen the principles of re&s;ignation, and a&s;&s;i&s;t its ex|erci&s;e. We are but travellers through this world; whatever affects only our outward condition, whatever is merely temporal, mu&s;t be of little moment; it is no more than the accommodation of an hour at an inn, which we are &s;oon to leave: it is too incon&s;iderable to di&s;turb our equanimity, or check our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. Our pro&s;pect is enlarged to eternity; we look down upon this world as from the height of heaven: and as the little hills, in the eye of him who &s;tands on the top of a lofty mountain, &s;ink to a level with the plain; this earth &s;eems but a point, and all tho&s;e earthly things which formerly looked big, and excited the mo&s;t anxious wi&s;hes or the mo&s;t pungent regret, dwindle into in&s;ignificance. We are rai&s;ed above &s;ome of tho&s;e clouds which ob&s;cure the throne of God, and give an appearance of confu&s;ion to the ways of his Providence: what was irregu|lar and inexplicable when referred only to
<PB N="176" REF="182">
time, becomes beautiful and con&s;i&s;tent by being connected with eternity. When we con|&s;ider this life as but one period of our being, one &s;tage of our progre&s;s to perfection, the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable events are often di&s;covered to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful, as tending mo&s;t di|rectly to the improvement of our hearts, and thus are rendered the objects of the mo&s;t ra|tional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and the mo&s;t cheerful re&s;ig|nation.</P>
<P>THE connexion of this life with eternity, opens likewi&s;e a new field for the exerci&s;e of our re&s;ignation and pious confidence. Un|able to direct our own cour&s;e amid&s;t pre&s;ent things, which are &s;een, we cannot but be more unable to direct it to the future world, where all is un&s;een. We have need of the guid|ance of him who ruleth both worlds; and to his guidance, a &s;en&s;e of our &s;ituation will make us &s;olicitous to commit our&s;elves. Na|ture feels the want; but the notices which nature gives of the future world, are too im|perfect to &s;upport confidence in God for its felicity. It is the go&s;pel only that can &s;upport it. It teaches us that God hath &s;et on foot a &s;tupendous di&s;pen&s;ation of grace and love for bringing the children of men to immortal glory. That &s;ins repented of might not pro|duce di&s;tru&s;t, he has given his Son for our
<PB N="177" REF="183">
redemption from all the&s;e &s;ins, and to be <HI>the Author of eternal &s;alvation unto all them that obey him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 9.</NOTE>. Informed of this di&s;pen&s;ation, we can, with joyful confidence, re&s;ign our eternal &s;tate, in well-doing, to the di&s;po&s;al of God our Savi|our. It was on purpo&s;e to render our <HI>faith and hope</HI> in him firm and a&s;&s;ured, that he has <HI>redeemed us by the precious blood of Chri&s;t, and rai&s;ed him up from the dead, and given him glory</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 18-21.</NOTE>. <HI>He that &s;pared not his own Son, but de|livered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all things</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>SUCH are the &s;entiments of God's charac|ter, of the nature of his Providence, and of his conduct and intentions with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, from which re&s;ignation to his will takes its ri&s;e. Re&s;ignation requires &s;ome knowledge of the ways of God, for &s;upport|ing and encouraging it; but it likewi&s;e &s;up|po&s;es &s;ome degree of ignorance and uncer|tainty, leaving room for implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and dependence. What we know of God, of the general mea&s;ures of his government, particu|larly over mankind, invite our acquie&s;cence in his di&s;po&s;als: in many ca&s;es too, he has given us expre&s;s promi&s;es, for the accompli&s;hment of which his fidelity is engaged, by which we may &s;afely regulate our expectations, and
<PB N="178" REF="184">
&s;u&s;tain our hopes, re&s;ting, &s;o far as they ex|tend, in full a&s;&s;urance of the very things pro|mi&s;ed. Amid&s;t the ab&s;olute uncertainty of the particular events which &s;hall befal us, <HI>we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 28.</NOTE>: and all our hopes for eternity he has directed by the mo&s;t explicit promi&s;es, and by a clear determination of the conditions on which we may become par|takers in them. But we are totally ignorant of the particular &s;teps of God's pre&s;ent provi|dence, of the nature of tho&s;e events which await us, and of <HI>what is good for man in this life</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vi. 12.</NOTE>: and we are ignorant of many things in the nature of our future &s;tate, and that di&s;|pen&s;ation by which the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the obedient is &s;ecured. The whole &s;y&s;tem of Divine Providence is too large and too in|tricate, to be fully comprehended by our weak under&s;tandings; the greate&s;t part of it is covered with thick darkne&s;s, and impene|trable to mortal eyes: <HI>no man can find out the work which God worketh, from the beginning to the end</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. iii. 11.</NOTE>. We can only have recour&s;e to that great Being who comprehends and orders all things, to whom <HI>all his works are known from the beginning of the world</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 14.</NOTE>; following impli|citly wherever he leads us, re&s;igning our&s;elves to his di&s;po&s;al, through all the unknown
<PB N="179" REF="185">
paths by which we mu&s;t travel forward to the more unknown regions of eternity.</P>
<P>TO explain the di&s;po&s;itions and exertions by which a temper of re&s;ignation is completed, was the SECOND thing propo&s;ed.&mdash;It con&s;i&s;ts not in a cold &s;peculative belief that the good and wi&s;e Providence of God orders all that concerns us, but in the con&s;ent of the heart that it &s;hould be &s;o. It pre&s;uppo&s;es love to God, which is indeed the common foundation of all the virtues of piety, and an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in every devout affection; for we can never refer our&s;elves to the di&s;po&s;al of a per&s;on whom we reckon not de&s;erving of our love: but it includes &s;omething additional to love; regarding the divine goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and omnipotence, as employed in the govern|ment of the world and the management of all our intere&s;ts, it appropriates the&s;e perfec|tions to our&s;elves, and begets a &s;en&s;e of &s;ecu|rity in yielding our&s;elves up to God's di&s;po&s;al. It includes hope in God, which renders it not the forced &s;ufferance of &s;laves, but the willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects. But the hope is mingled with fear; the &s;ove|reignty of God impre&s;&s;es us with awe; the extent of his plan of government involves us in uncertainty, what kind of events he may perceive to be be&s;t for us; we feel pre&s;ent &s;or|rows, and have rea&s;on to believe, that the ge|neral
<PB N="180" REF="186">
good and our own greate&s;t happine&s;s will require our bearing many things which are di&s;agreeable, and our enduring &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ements for our iniquities. A &s;en&s;e of this prevents our indulging the expectation of every thing that would be plea&s;ing to us, and in its place &s;ub&s;titutes a general confidence, that what impairs our &s;atisfaction, will not|with&s;tanding contribute to our happine&s;s.&mdash;Re&s;ignation requires us to receive both good and evil from God: but it requires us not to receive them with the very &s;ame &s;entiments. It &s;uppo&s;es that we are &s;en&s;ible of pain, that we feel it with aver&s;ion, and look forward to it with apprehen&s;ion: it con&s;i&s;ts in our never|thele&s;s encountering and &s;u&s;taining it with quietne&s;s, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Him who has or|dained it. It allows us to &s;orrow, but not to fret: it allows us to fear, but not to de&s;pair: it allows us to de&s;ire, but not with impatience. It leads us to yield to tho&s;e events which we cannot avoid, without any rebellious motions of heart. It is a pliablene&s;s of &s;oul, by which our temper &s;uits it&s;elf to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of our &s;tate. It brings our will and our de&s;ires to give place to the plea&s;ure of God, as &s;oon as we di&s;cover what it is. It teaches us to check our inclinations whenever they are in|con&s;i&s;tent with his appointments; and to con|troul them &s;teadily, till they concur with his
<PB N="181" REF="187">
good and perfect will, and &s;uffer us to re&s;t &s;atisfied with all that he decrees, as the be&s;t for us.&mdash;That we may the more di&s;tinctly perceive the operation of a temper of re&s;igna|tion, let us con&s;ider it as exerci&s;ed with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent,&mdash;the pa&s;t,&mdash;and the future.</P>
<P>1. RESIGNATION mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent. Whatever our condi|tion at any time is, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it con|tentedly, patiently, and with dutiful acquie&s;|cence in the will of God. Re&s;ignation &s;uppo&s;es not that all things &s;hould become indifferent to us: this would be to dive&s;t us of the &s;en&s;es and affections which are e&s;&s;ential to human nature. It requires us not to be in&s;en&s;ible either of the defects or the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our lot: it requires us only to bear them. It is not to be mea&s;ured by the acutene&s;s of our feelings: the tempers of men are nece&s;&s;arily very different. Some have a natural coldne&s;s or hardine&s;s of con&s;titution, which admits but a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion from circum&s;tances of un|ea&s;ine&s;s: but if their compo&s;ure proceed not from a religious &s;en&s;e of the Divine Provi|dence, it is not re&s;ignation; it is only a &s;tupid unfeelingne&s;s of &s;oul, or a &s;ullen &s;tubbornne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. Others are of a &s;oft and deli|cate make, ea&s;ily and deeply affected with whatever befals them: but if they, notwith|&s;tanding&punc;
<PB N="182" REF="188">
pre&s;erve an unrepining reverence of Providence, the &s;en&s;ibility of their hearts is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with re&s;ignation, that it much enhances it: they devoutly chu&s;e that God's good plea&s;ure be accompli&s;hed, though it gives them &s;o great pain. The be&s;t of men have expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e of their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es very pathetically, even while they exer|ci&s;ed the mo&s;t blamele&s;s and exemplary re&s;ig|nation. Job welcomed the lo&s;s of all his &s;ub&s;tance and all his children with the cheer|fulle&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it was the Lord who had taken them away: yet he <HI>rent his mantle, and &s;haved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and &s;aid, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked &s;hall I return thither</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, i. 20, 21.</NOTE>: but <HI>in all this,</HI> we are a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Job &s;inned not, nor charged God fooli&s;hly</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22.</NOTE>. <HI>I was dumb,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>I opened not my mouth, becau&s;e thou did&s;t it</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxix. 9.</NOTE>: this was the meeke&s;t re&s;ignation; but it prevented not his having a pungent &s;en&s;e of <HI>the reproach of the fooli&s;h, the &s;troke of God, and the blow of his hand</HI> by which he was <HI>con|&s;umed</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 8. 10.</NOTE>.

<P>ANY pre&s;ent di&s;&s;atisfaction or unca&s;ine&s;s is apt to engro&s;s all our thoughts, and to ab&s;orb our whole attention. We often yield to the impre&s;&s;ion of it, without any effort to relieve or to re&s;i&s;t it. We abandon our&s;elves to grief, and &s;ink into dejection. The &s;pirit of re&s;ignation &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch &s;entiments as can divert or alleviate the &s;en&s;ation of di&s;tre&s;s. It renders us recollected, and when that &s;en&s;ation cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, draws out the vigour of our &s;ouls on purpo&s;e to &s;u&s;tain it.&mdash;In&s;tead of endeavouring to re&s;train or mitigate the &s;en&s;ations of unea&s;ine&s;s, we too often wilfully inflame them. We &s;uffer imagination to &s;earch out all the circum&s;tances that can ag|gravate them, and we ince&s;&s;antly ruminate upon them. By the multitude of our thoughts, we are loaded with &s;upernumerary evils, our &s;ouls are broken into peevi&s;hne&s;s, and irritated into di&s;content. Re&s;ignation checks the wan|derings of imagination; it turns it to &s;uch views as can divert our grief: we think how much wor&s;e our &s;ituation might have been, and how much wor&s;e the full puni&s;hment of
<PB N="184" REF="190">
our &s;ins would render it; and we become plea&s;ed that it is &s;o tolerable: we con&s;ider the good ends to which it may be improved, and embrace it as the means of confirming us in tho&s;e virtues to which it gives &s;cope and opportunity.&mdash;By our yielding to the impre&s;&s;ions of pain or di&s;appointment, they are enabled to de&s;troy our reli&s;h for all en|joyment.

<P>THE irreligious attend not to the hand of God in what befals them: or if they acknow|ledge it, it is only to cen&s;ure the ordinations of his Providence, to complain of the &s;everity of his di&s;pen&s;ations, to murmur and repine, to &s;et their mouth again&s;t the heavens, and even, it may be, to bla&s;pheme the perfections of the divine nature. The pious man, on the con|trary, a&s;cribes all that befals him to the be|nevolent and wi&s;e appointment of God; and even when he cannot help lamenting his own condition, he &s;uffers not him&s;elf to think hardly, or to complain of Providence. He

A full conviction of the wi&s;dom and benevolence of Providence, may ju&s;tly be as effectual for compo&s;ing our &s;ouls into re&s;igna|tion, as the pro&s;pect of any determinate ad|vantage.

<P>AN unre&s;igned temper breaks in upon the affection which we owe to men, as well as upon the regard which we owe to God. It fixes our view on tho&s;e per&s;ons who have contributed to our di&s;appointments or our calamities; and it kindles wrath, rancour, and revenge again&s;t them. It excites the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions again&s;t &s;uch as have been only the in|nocent occa&s;ions of our lo&s;&s;es or our &s;uffer|ings.
<PB N="187" REF="193">
It directs our attention to tho&s;e who are in more fortunate circum&s;tances than our|&s;elves; and it tortures us with envy. It pro|duces a &s;ettled di&s;&s;atisfaction, which breaks out in ill humour, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and abu&s;e towards all who are connected with us. Re&s;ignation, on the contrary, by e&s;tabli&s;hing continual &s;e|renity of &s;oul, prepares the heart for exerci&s;ing benevolence in every &s;ituation. Under the heavie&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s, it leads us to treat our companions, our friends, our families, our dependants, with a placid &s;weetne&s;s, and mild though perhaps melancholy complacence. It permits not a wi&s;h for bettering our own &s;tate, by robbing any man of his pro&s;perity. It di&s;tingui&s;hes between the innocent occa|&s;ions, and the guilty cau&s;es of our troubles; and even towards the latter, it repre&s;&s;es the emotions of malevolence: repentance and for|givene&s;s are all that it prays may overtake them. It con&s;iders all &s;econd cau&s;es as only in&s;truments employed by the Supreme Ruler; and by re&s;pect to him, it &s;oftens all our &s;en|timents of them.

<P><PB N="188" REF="194">THE continuance of adver&s;ity is apt to de|pre&s;s men's &s;pirits, or to produce impatience.

Struggling again&s;t his appointment, they attempt to ex|tricate them&s;elves by unlawful means; or fainting under his correction, they become in|capable of u&s;ing any means for their deliver|ance, &s;it down in &s;ullen indolence, and &s;ink into de&s;pondence. Re&s;ignation condemns not the wi&s;h for deliverance from evil; but it prevents its &s;welling into anxiety, and it keeps it in &s;ubordinacy to God's good plea&s;ure. It converts all the wi&s;hes of the heart into de|vout &s;upplications, and directs them to heaven in fervent prayers to God mo&s;t high. It is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with innocent en|deavours to remove what occa&s;ions us di&s;quiet, that it qualifies us for employing them to the be&s;t advantage. The inward &s;erenity which it e&s;tabli&s;hes, enables us quickly to di&s;cern, what &s;teps we have it in our power to take; and the tranquillity and firmne&s;s of mind which it produces, prepares us for pur&s;uing them with prudence, vigour, and per&s;everance.

<P>2. OUR re&s;ignation mu&s;t extend its influence backward to the pa&s;t. To di&s;content on ac|count of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of imagination often &s;uperadds an unea&s;y and repining recollection of events which hap|pened long ago. There is rea&s;on for our reproaching our&s;elves with &s;uch events, when they were owing to our own mi&s;conduct; yet even in this ca&s;e repentance for that mi&s;con|duct is &s;ufficient, and perpetual regret for the inconveniences which it once occa|&s;ioned, is wrong. <HI>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puni&s;hment of his &s;ins</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lam. iii. 39.</NOTE>? But when di&s;agreeable events aro&s;e not from our own fault, no natural principle can lead us to allow the remembrance of them to eat out our pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction. It &s;hould rather heighten the reli&s;h of &s;ucceeding ea&s;e and pro|&s;perity. To be continually thinking, how much better our &s;ituation might have been at times than it actually was; to retain re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the authors of our pa&s;t misfor|tunes; to remain implacable again&s;t Provi|dence for permitting them; to cheri&s;h the fretful remembrance of them, and the re|mains

<P>THE pre&s;&s;ure of a pre&s;ent evil may plead &s;ome excu&s;e for frail man, if he murmur under it: but when the evil it&s;elf is pa&s;t, to retain the ill temper which it produced, is inexcu&s;able. Deliverance from calamity is the &s;ubject, not of murmuring, but of thank|fulne&s;s. If it has left &s;ome con&s;equences which affect your pre&s;ent &s;tate, yet we ought by degrees to reconcile our&s;elves to them. The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault of trouble may &s;urprize us into peevi&s;hne&s;s; but when we have had lei|&s;ure to bethink our&s;elves, and to ponder it deliberately, it is but rea&s;onable to expect we &s;hould call up our re&s;olution, collect our courage, invigorate our &s;ouls to bear it, apply our&s;elves to the peculiar duties for which it gives opportunity, and form our&s;elves to that cheerful enjoyment of life, which becomes tho&s;e who live in a world regulated by infi|nite perfection.

Formed rea&s;onable creatures, capa|ble of fore&s;eeing the con&s;equences of our own actions, and the effects likely to re&s;ult from other cau&s;es, we cannot be wholly uncon|cerned about the future. We gue&s;s what it will be, and regard it either with hope or with fear. It is this wi&s;e and gracious con&s;titution of our nature that fits us for regulating our conduct by the pro&s;pect of what may be, for being affected with good or evil before they become pre&s;ent, and for u&s;ing our endeavours to obtain the one and avoid the other. But many convert it into a &s;ource of di&s;quiet and
<PB N="193" REF="199">
vexation: by the abu&s;e of it, &s;olicitude and impatience, about future events, creates them far greater unhappine&s;s than the &s;en&s;e of pre|&s;ent evils. They are ever prying into tho&s;e de&s;igns of Providence which are un&s;earchable to human &s;agacity, and mi&s;erable, becau&s;e they find them&s;elves unable to di&s;cover them. They wi&s;h for &s;ome good thing; and grieve them&s;elves becau&s;e they cannot obtain it: they hope to obtain another; but repine that it is not already obtained. They di&s;tre&s;s them&s;elves with terrors which will never be realized: the very po&s;&s;ibility of trouble or di&s;appointment fills them with apprehen&s;ions: if it become probable, they are overpowered with dread, and either wait its approach with de&s;pond|ence, or e&s;&s;ay to prevent it by doing what is wrong: and if it become imminent, <HI>trouble and angui&s;h make them afraid, and prevail again&s;t them as a king ready to the battle</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, xv. 24.</NOTE>.

prepare our&s;elves for bearing them, and to exert our&s;elves in improving them. Sen&s;ible of our own ignorance concerning what would be be&s;t for us, we &s;hould refer all our concerns to the direction of Him who is infi|nitely wi&s;er than we, and more concerned for our true happine&s;s than our&s;elves can be.&mdash;Unable to conjecture what may be before us, we &s;hould rejoice that it is only what God wills, &s;aying with David, <HI>I tru&s;ted in thee, O Lord; I &s;aid, Thou art my God, my times are in thy hand</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxi. 14, 15.</NOTE>.

The language of our &s;ouls ought al|ways to be, Lead me, O God, whither thou wilt, I willingly follow thee: &s;end what is truly good for me, though I &s;hould be aver&s;e from receiving it: withhold what would be hurtful, though I &s;hould mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ire it. It is not in the power of man to fru&s;trate the ordinations of Provi|dence: the &s;evere&s;t of them every mortal mu&s;t endure, however bitterly he repine, and however violently he &s;truggle again&s;t them: by reconciling our &s;ouls to them, we only

<P>I MEAN not that re&s;ignation forbids our wi&s;hing for an ea&s;y and comfortable &s;tate, in preference to a lot of &s;orrow and calamity. The wi&s;h is natural and inevitable.

We &s;hould not &s;uffer it either to &s;ettle too peremptorily on a particu|lar object, which, for what we know, he may &s;ee meet to refu&s;e, or to &s;well into anxiety and carefulne&s;s. We &s;hould check every propen|&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e any one of the uncertain enjoy|ments of this world e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s.

<P>RESIGNATION mu&s;t not be confounded with improvident thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s about futurity. It permits the mo&s;t attentive foreca&s;t; but it renders it calm and compo&s;ed.

<HEAD>SERMON VII. SUBJECTION TO THE AUTHORITY OF GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM cxix. 4.</BIBL>
 Thou ha&s;t commanded us to keep thy precepts dili|gently.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE will of God may be con&s;idered in two lights, as regarding either the events which befal us, or the conduct which is pre&s;cribed to us. Viewed in the former light, it is the object of re&s;ignation; viewed in the latter, of &s;ubjection and obedience. Re&s;ignation ari&s;es from a &s;en&s;e of God's right to di&s;po&s;e of us, and of the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of all his di&s;po&s;itions: &s;ubjection ari&s;es from a &s;en&s;e of his right to command us, aid|ed by a conviction of the equity and benevo|lence of all his laws. The one is a willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's natural government of the world: the other a willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="204" REF="209">
his moral government. United, they complete that loyalty of heart which we owe to the So|vereign of the univer&s;e. It is the latter that my text leads us to con&s;ider. In this addre&s;s, <HI>Thou ha&s;t commanded us to keep thy precepts dili|gently;</HI> or, as it is tran&s;lated by &s;ome, <HI>Thou ha&s;t commanded thy precepts that they may be dili|gently kept;</HI> David acknowledges that God publi&s;hes his laws with an authority which demands our obedience, and expre&s;&s;es his own di&s;po&s;ition to yield obedience. A &s;en&s;e of duty towards God, a &s;ubjection of heart to his &s;tatutes, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly incumbent on us as the &s;ubjects of his government, and is the immediate principle of compliance with the dictates of his will. For illu&s;trating this im|portant part of piety, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>FIRST, That authority by which all his laws exact our obedience; and,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, That &s;ubjection of heart which is due to the authority of the&s;e laws.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider the nature of God's authority over us, or of his right to pre&s;cribe us laws which we are obliged to ob|&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="210">IN order to perceive it, we mu&s;t attend to the con&s;titution of our moral nature, we mu&s;t reflect on the operation of our own con|&s;cience. From it, our very idea of authority is primarily derived. Con&s;cience is our &s;upreme power: it claims a right to govern all our pa&s;&s;ions and actions; and it forces us to feel that it has a right to govern them. By it we <HI>are a law unto our&s;elves</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 14.</NOTE>. In its very exertion, we, without rea&s;oning or &s;tudy, perceive the authority of its dictates, and our obligation to regulate all our motions according to them.&mdash;What it approves, we are immediately &s;en&s;i|ble is right, and ought to be done; what it di&s;approves is wrong, and ought not to be done. It does not merely propo&s;e our duty; it enjoins it: it does not merely di&s;cern good from evil; it commands, and it forbids.&mdash;When our heart tells us that we have violated its commands, we condemn our&s;elves, we are &s;tung with remor&s;e, con&s;cious of ill de&s;ert, and apprehen&s;ive of mi&s;ery: but when we reflect on our having fulfilled them, we become po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;elf-complacence, inward joy, the feeling of good de&s;ert, and the hope of happi|ne&s;s. Such is our original idea of authority: the very acting of con&s;cience involves a &s;en&s;e of the authority of its own decrees, and, cor|re&s;pondent
<PB N="206" REF="211">
to this, of our obligation to com|ply with them.</P>
<P>IT is con&s;cience, likewi&s;e, that makes us ca|pable of perceiving, and teaches us to acknow|ledge, authority in one per&s;on over another. It enables us to di&s;tingui&s;h a lawful &s;uperior from a tyrant or u&s;urper; it recognizes in the for|mer, a right to command us, which belongs not to the latter. One of our fellow-men may become our lawful &s;uperior: and whenever he does, con&s;cience requires us to obey him, and enforces our obedience to him, by the very &s;ame &s;entiments and exertions, as our &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to its own decrees. The coun&s;els of a friend are, to our feeling, e&s;&s;entially different from the orders of a &s;uperior. A ma&s;ter, a father, a ruler, a &s;overeign, have a ju&s;t autho|rity, to which we <HI>mu&s;t be &s;ubject for con&s;cience &s;ake</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 5.</NOTE>. But when we turn our thoughts to God, and con&s;ider his perfections, and the re|lations in which he &s;tands to us, con&s;cience ac|knowledges an higher authority and a more &s;acred obligation. All the characters which can imply a right to command us, are united in him, and belong to him, in an infinitely higher &s;en&s;e than to any other being.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="212">OUR parents are not the proper cau&s;es of our exi&s;tence: they are only the in&s;truments by means of whom we receive it.

Di&s;regard to it, is nece&s;&s;arily and univer&s;ally accounted, not only ba&s;e, but unnatural. God is the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, who made our parents the in&s;truments of bringing us into life: he is the proper Author of our being and our whole nature. His authority is, therefore, greater and more ab&s;olute: to oppo&s;e it, is ba&s;er and more unnatural. <HI>Shall we not much rather be in &s;ubjection to the Father of our &s;pirits,</HI> than to the <HI>fathers of our fle&s;h</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 9.</NOTE>? <HI>Thy hands have made me and fa&s;hioned me:</HI> therefore ought I to <HI>learn</HI> and to keep all <HI>thy commandments</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxix. 73.</NOTE>.

<P>A MASTER has a right to the labour and obedience of a &s;ervant, while he &s;u&s;tains him;

He has a perfect right to our &s;ervice and allegiance: he &s;up|ports our very being; he gives energy to all our powers. If he withdrew his pre&s;erving hand for a &s;ingle moment, they would all be bla&s;ted, and we mu&s;t fall into nothing. To re&s;i&s;t his authority, to tran&s;gre&s;s his laws, is to affect independence upon him, on whom we are totally dependent: it is to oppo&s;e him with tho&s;e faculties which we retain, and can exerci&s;e, only by his permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A FELLOW-CREATURE who has the ju&s;te&s;t authority over us, may give commands which are of no obligation: they may be unlawful and wrong. But the authority of God is ab&s;o|lute in all things; the obligation of his laws admits of no exception.

<P>THE benevolence of God's nature gives ad|ditional authority to his laws. Men may i&s;&s;ue their orders without regard to the intere&s;t of tho&s;e from whom they require obedience, or even with a view to hurt them. But perfect goodne&s;s can enact no laws in the moral world, but &s;uch as are intended for the mo&s;t exten&s;ive happine&s;s of the rational creation. They are de&s;igned to point out and enforce that cour&s;e by which moral agents may pro|mote the general good, and their own true in|tere&s;t. By violating the laws of God, we do what we can to bring mi&s;ery on our&s;elves and others. By making them the invariable rule of our temper and our conduct, we contribute our part to the perfection and order of the univer&s;e, and we pur&s;ue our own felicity. <HI>The Lord</HI> hath <HI>commanded us to do all the&s;e &s;tatutes for our good always</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi 24.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="210" REF="215">WITH the be&s;t intention po&s;&s;ible, men may pre&s;cribe us rules which &s;hall prove of very pernicious con&s;equence.

<P>RECTITUDE, benevolence, and wi&s;dom, united in a &s;uperior degree, give a man an authority and influence among his fellows, to which they of their own accord pay a defe|rence, though he has not power to enforce it. This is the true&s;t authority. Mere power, by creating dependence, may compel &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: but the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is always reluctant and un|willing. On the contrary, that which we yield
<PB N="211" REF="216">
to the directions of &s;uperior worth and wi&s;|dom, is &s;pontaneous and hearty. Our heartie&s;t and our mo&s;t cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is therefore due to God. All his precepts are the dictates of infinite perfection; the coun&s;els of good|ne&s;s and wi&s;dom in conjunction, for regulat|ing our whole conduct: can we imagine our|&s;elves at liberty not to regard them? They are a tran&s;cript of his own excellence: and can they be but binding upon all tho&s;e creatures whom he has formed capable of becoming partakers of his excellence? Every precept of God has an inherent authority, implied in its excellence, its nece&s;&s;ity, and its utility: an in|junction from the All-perfect carries along with it an immediate obligation upon us to obey it.</P>
<P>BUT &s;trong and commanding as this imme|diate and internal obligation is, our obedience is not left to re&s;t on it alone. Every perfect law contains a &s;anction, as well as a precept. All the precepts of God's law are enforced by &s;anctions. Puni&s;hment is denounced again&s;t the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and reward is promi&s;ed to the ob&s;ervers of them. The &s;trength of the obligation thence re&s;ulting is confe&s;&s;ed by all: the force of &s;anctions exacts obedience from tho&s;e who would pay little regard to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the precept. Human laws
<PB N="212" REF="217">
generally owe their influence almo&s;t wholly to their &s;anctions; their authority is &s;lighted, when the&s;e are not &s;trictly and vigorou&s;ly exe|cuted: and by impotence, or inju&s;tice in the execution, the be&s;t laws are rendered totaliy ineffectual. With the divine law it never can be &s;o. The venerable authority of its precepts is awfully &s;upported by its &s;anctions. They are the mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting; and it is certain that they will be executed. They can neither be wre&s;ted by inju&s;tice, nor de|feated through impotence.&mdash;The divine Law|giver is <HI>a God of truth, and without iniquity; ju&s;t and right is he</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 4.</NOTE>. His perfect ju&s;tice binds him to maintain the authority, and vindicate the honour of his laws. With incorruptible and undeviating righteou&s;ne&s;s, he will inflict puni&s;hment on the di&s;obedient, and be&s;tow reward on the obedient. In his admini&s;tra|tion there can be no partiality.

<P>So manifold are the foundations of God's authority over us. On every po&s;&s;ible princi|ple, he has a right to govern us by his laws. His authority is &s;upreme; to it all other mu&s;t give way: it is &s;overeign over all the actions of the mo&s;t exalted creatures, and is by them acknowledged to be &s;overeign; <HI>his angels a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word;</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ts</HI> of heaven are <HI>his mi|ni&s;ters,</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="219">
<HI>that do his plea&s;ure</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ciii. 20, 21.</NOTE>: how then can the children of men plead an exemption from obedience? His authority is ab&s;olute, cir|cum&s;cribed by no limitation: to render any thing incumbent on us, it is only nece&s;&s;ary that it be required by God; to convince us that it is incumbent and to make us guilty in neglecting it, it is &s;ufficient that we know it to be required by him. Whether it be &s;ugge&s;ted by nature, or intimated by revelation, whe|ther it be enjoined by the dictates of con|&s;cience, or impo&s;ed by a written precept, we are bound to it by the whole &s;trength of the divine authority.</P>
<P>REASON qualifies us for reflecting on the con&s;titution of our nature, and teaches us that it is the workman&s;hip of God; that he made con&s;cience a part of it, that he gave it the authority which we feel it has to govern us, and therefore that it is the will of our Maker that we &s;hould be governed by it. It is he who hath, by its notices, <HI>&s;hewed thee, O man, what is good,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured thee that <HI>the Lord doth require</HI> it <HI>of thee</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mic. vi. 8.</NOTE>.

<PB N="215" REF="220">
and it proves it&s;elf to be the guide of life, which he has appointed thee to follow. It impre&s;&s;es an in&s;tantaneous and irre&s;i&s;tible con|viction, that all its dictates are his <HI>laws written in</HI> thy <HI>heart</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">m. ii. 15.</NOTE>. It enacts them as his laws, and it proclaims their &s;anctions. While it puni&s;hes the violation of them with imme|diate remor&s;e, it denounces farther puni&s;h|ment from the hand of God; it forces on thee a perception of demerit towards him, and guiltine&s;s in his &s;ight; and it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lls thee with apprehen&s;ion of the mi&s;ery threatened in that perception. While it approves the ob&s;erv|ance of them, and rewards it with gladne&s;s of heart, it likewi&s;e promi&s;es a higher reward; it declares it worthy of God's approbation; and in&s;pires the hope of happine&s;s from his favour.</P>
<P>THE clearer and fuller publication of his &s;tatutes, in his word, is attended with the &s;ame authority. All the holy men who by in&s;piration promulgated his moral laws, in|culcated them upon the con&s;ciences of men by, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord;</HI> declared him the Al|mighty Vindicator of them, and fortified them by promi&s;es and threatenings from his mouth. Convinced that they &s;poke by commi&s;&s;ion from
<PB N="216" REF="221">
him, we are bound to receive all their words as the words of God. The perfect revelation of his will in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, is &s;tamped with the highe&s;t authority of heaven, and en|titled to our mo&s;t dutiful and reverent &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion by many circum&s;tances of affecting peculiarity. It has the authority of God ex|plicitly interpo&s;ed for it, when by a voice from heaven he te&s;tified, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed,</HI> HEAR YE HIM <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvii. 5.</NOTE>. It has likewi&s;e the authority of the only begotten Son of God: to <HI>magnify the law, and make it honourable</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xlii. 21.</NOTE>, he &s;ent a divine me&s;&s;enger to pro|mulgate it. He &s;aid, <HI>They will reverence my Son</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxi. 37.</NOTE>. His dignity be&s;peaks its infinite im|portance, and recommends it to our mo&s;t careful and con&s;cientious ob&s;ervance. In pub|li&s;hing the will of God, Chri&s;t &s;poke, not only as the me&s;&s;enger, and as the Son of God, but al&s;o as the Saviour of mankind; who has recovered us to the ability of obeying it, and re&s;tored us to a capacity of obtaining, through him, the reward of obedience; who, by dying for us, has purcha&s;ed our &s;ervice to God. By him God demands our obedience on a new title, &s;uperadded to all the other rights of his &s;overeign dominion. He demands it as <HI>God</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="222">
<HI>our Saviour</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 1.</NOTE>.

He requires us to <HI>glorify him in our body and in our &s;pirit,</HI> becau&s;e he hath <HI>bought us with a price</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 20.</NOTE>. By exacting the death of Chri&s;t for our re|demption, he has made an awful declaration of the &s;acred obligation of his laws. In the go&s;pel, obedience to them is &s;ecured by the great &s;anctions of eternal life and eternal death, clearly revealed, &s;trikingly de&s;cribed, and not only confirmed by the mo&s;t expre&s;s promi&s;es and threatenings, but al&s;o &s;ealed by the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT now is implied in that &s;ubjection of heart, which the authority of God's laws de|mands from us? To explain this, was the SE|COND thing propo&s;ed: and in explaining it, we will be be&s;t directed by attention to the &s;ame con&s;titution of human nature, which has led us to a ju&s;t conception of the divine authority.&mdash;Our nature con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, con&s;cience, enjoining what God requires us to do, and ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions, either oppo&s;ing or comply|ing with what it enjoins For our being in &s;ubjection to the laws of our Creator, it is nece&s;&s;ary both that con&s;cience enjoin with
<PB N="218" REF="223">
force, and that appetite and pa&s;&s;ion obey with readine&s;s. A temper of &s;ubjection, therefore, implies two things,&mdash;that a &s;en&s;e of duty to|wards God, or a regard to his will, be the rul|ing principle of our conduct,&mdash;and that all our other principles of action &s;ubmit to be regu|lated by it.</P>
<P>1. A REGARD to the will of God, mu&s;t be our ruling principle of conduct. The very definition of authority, is a right to govern us; the very idea of a law, is a declaration of the will of a &s;uperior, obligatory upon us. Con|&s;cience, which is the original law of God to us, and the immediate percipient of the obli|gation of all his laws, differs e&s;&s;entially from our other active powers. It does not merely incline or impel us: it pre&s;cribes authorita|tively, and pronounces it unlawful and wrong not to li&s;ten to it. Each of the others is in|tended to influence us only on &s;ome occa&s;ions, in &s;uch of our actions as it is particularly adapted to: but con&s;cience is intended to in|fluence us at all times, it is alike adapted to all our actions. To govern them all is its right; and it is our leading principle, when|ever it has power to maintain this right.&mdash;God gave us his law, to be our rule in all ca&s;es and at all times without exception.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224">A GENUINE regard to its authority, will fir&s;t of all render us &s;olicitous to know, what it is that God requires of us. To have no concern &s;o much as to know our duty, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the fainte&s;t de&s;ire to do it; it betrays the gro&s;&s;e&s;t indifference about it; it is pouring the utmo&s;t contempt upon the autho|rity by which it is required. To li&s;ten to him when he &s;peaks, is the very lowe&s;t mark of deference that we can pay to a &s;uperior; an equal would with rea&s;on be offended, if even from him we &s;hould with-hold it.

<P>CONSCIENCE is both a power of perception, and a principle of action. Its influence as a principle, will always be in proportion to the clearne&s;s and the &s;trength of its perceptions. If it apprehends our duty darkly and uncer|tainly, it mu&s;t impo&s;e it with he&s;itation; if it feels obligation faintly, it can inculcate it but feebly: but when it is accurately informed, it dictates with a&s;&s;urance; when its &s;en&s;ations are affecting, it commands with energy. It is its vigour, as a principle of action, that gives effect to its perceptions, that &s;ecures the application of them to the actual direction of our con|duct, and impre&s;&s;es us with a prevailing re|gard to the will of God. Entitled by the ori|ginal con&s;titution of our nature, and the appointment of him who formed it, to rule within us, its right is notwith&s;tanding often violated, and its authority de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e it

has lo&s;t its power. We &s;ee what is right, and yet do what is wrong. We hear its com|mands, and we counteract them. Its throne is u&s;urped by pa&s;&s;ion. We are in a temper of di&s;obedience to God. That his laws may govern us, con&s;cience mu&s;t be rein&s;tated in its ju&s;t &s;upremacy. Its power mu&s;t be commen|&s;urate with its authority. It mu&s;t be able to enforce whatever it pronounces to be right. All who are not perfectly abandoned pay &s;ome regard to con&s;cience: they allow it &s;ome in|fluence in its turn with their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions; they act from it in &s;ome in&s;tances; they do &s;ome things becau&s;e they are right, and forbear others becau&s;e they are wrong. But this is not enough. Like the Almighty, who&s;e deputy it is, it ought to have ab&s;olute and uncontrouled dominion.

<P>2. THAT our hearts may become &s;ubject to the law of God, it is nece&s;&s;ary, not only that con&s;cience be invigorated, and enabled to en|force our duty powerfully, but likewi&s;e that all our other principles of action be formed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it, and regulated in all their ex|ertions according to its dictates. Con&s;cience is not the whole of human nature: along with that &s;upreme faculty, we have many appetites, pa&s;&s;ions, and affections, which attach us to a variety of objects, and impel us to a variety of actions. Whenever their objects are pre&s;ented, they nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e, and in&s;tinctively urge us to tho&s;e actions by which they may be ob|tained. If the only practicable means of ob|taining them, in any ca&s;e, be di&s;allowed by con&s;cience, and condemned by the law of God, they will, in proportion to their &s;trength, in|&s;tigate us to violate con&s;cience and deviate from our duty.

Other virtues are po&s;itive in their nature; they con&s;i&s;t in the &s;trength and pre|valence of pious or kind affections; they i&s;&s;ue in performance. The&s;e affections, and all the genuine exertions of them, are good in them|&s;elves; and, on account of their inherent good|ne&s;s, are approved and enjoined by con&s;cience.
<PB N="235" REF="240">
The&s;e are the proper and immediate &s;prings of the practice which is congruous to them; and give it value, though we &s;hould not re|flect on its being our duty. If it were not the expre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e affections, but proceeded &s;olely from the &s;en&s;e of duty, it would be obe|dience, but it could not be charity or devotion. Yet con&s;cience operates along with them; its approbation follows clo&s;e upon their earlie&s;t motions, it attends them in all progre&s;&s;ive ex|ertions, it encourages and animates them, it invigorates them, by inculcating that the di|vine authority is interpo&s;ed in their fa|vour.</P>
<P>THAT &s;ubjection of heart to the law of God, which we have now explained, is a very im|portant temper. It is indi&s;pen&s;ibly due to God as our lawgiver, our &s;overeign, and our king.

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. REGARD TO THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ISA. xxxiii. 22.</BIBL>
 The Lord is our Judge.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE con&s;titution of human nature per|mits us not to be indifferent to the &s;en|timents of others concerning our character and conduct. A total di&s;regard to them would &s;hew depravity of &s;oul; a great unconcerned|ne&s;s about them would betray the want of that delicate &s;en&s;ibility which is in&s;eparable from true worth. The judgment of the vir|tuous and di&s;cerning is, for its own &s;ake, an object of affection to every human heart: their good opinion we de&s;ire with ardour, and reflect upon with joy; their ill opinion we re|gard with aver&s;ion; to have incurred it, over|whelms us with &s;orrow and confution. But if we be particularly connected with them, e&s;pe|cially if we in any re&s;pect depend upon them, their good or their ill opinion, by being of
<PB N="240" REF="244">
advantage or di&s;advantage to us, becomes &s;till more intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>RELIGION eradicates none of the&s;e determi|nations of nature. It grafts its exertions on them as their proper roots. From inadequate objects, it turns them to an object perfectly adequate. It teaches us that <HI>the Lord is our judge.</HI> It requires us to pay a &s;upreme and con&s;tant regard to the judgment of that God, who alone can ju&s;tly e&s;timate our character, and who&s;e e&s;timation of it is of infinite import|ance to us. This regard is an e&s;&s;ential part of the duty which we owe to God; and it is a powerful incitement to that cour&s;e of life which is plea&s;ing to him, and productive of our own happine&s;s, both in this world and in the next.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, I propo&s;e to con&s;i|der it, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> in its principle; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> in its operation.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;hall point out the proper <HI>principle</HI> of a &s;upreme regard to the judgment of God. It is in brief a lively conception of God,&mdash;as our omni&s;cient witne&s;s,&mdash;as nece&s;&s;arily ap|proving or di&s;approving us,&mdash;and as our pro|per and righteous governor, who will reward tho&s;e whom he approves, and puni&s;h tho&s;e whom he di&s;approves.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="245">1. GOD is continually pre&s;ent with us, in|timately acquainted with our real characters, the witne&s;s of all our thoughts, and words, and actions. By this he is qualified for being in an eminent &s;en&s;e <HI>our Judge.</HI> It is but a &s;mall part of our behaviour, of which any man can be an eye witne&s;s; and even that part he may know but imperfectly: he &s;ees our ac|tions, but he can often only gue&s;s at our mo|tives and our intentions. Of many of our ac|tions he is wholly ignorant; and therefore he can form no opinion about them. But there is not a particular of our heart or our life&punc; of our temper or our conver&s;ation, exempt from the judgment of God; for he knows and ob|&s;erves all things. <HI>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 3.</NOTE> <HI>His eyes behold, his eye-lids try the children of men</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xi. 4.</NOTE>; <HI>doth not he &s;ee my ways, and count all my &s;teps</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxi. 4.</NOTE><HI>?

<P>2. THE God who is perfectly acquainted with all our di&s;po&s;itions and our actions, can|not behold any one of them with indifference: he ob&s;erves them on purpo&s;e to e&s;timate their real nature: he nece&s;&s;arily approves or di&s;ap|proves them. It is this that renders his know|ledge of them important. We would con&s;ider our&s;elves as alone, in the pre&s;ence of a per&s;on who could not di&s;cern between right and wrong. It is our being endued with a moral nature, with a power which di&s;tingui&s;hes good from evil, and regards them with contrary &s;entiments, that renders one man at all capable of judging concerning the character and con|duct of another. It is that divine perfection, of which this ruling faculty of the human &s;oul is the image and the offspring, that ren|ders <HI>the Lord our judge.</HI> He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ab&s;olute rectitude of nature: he not only is pure from all moral evil, but he holds it in abomination;
<PB N="244" REF="248">
he not only is perfect in all moral goodne&s;s, but he loveth goodne&s;s. An invariable love of virtue and hatred of vice is nece&s;&s;arily im|plied in his e&s;&s;ential rectitude, and it is the fir&s;t principle of his ju&s;tice. Without this attri|bute, he could neither perceive nor approve his own excellence; and with it, he cannot but approve, favour, and be plea&s;ed with whatever is right, and di&s;approve, condemn, and be offended with whatever is wrong, in the characters and behaviour of all his rea&s;on|able creatures. <HI>The Lord God is the holy One, of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hab. i. 12, 13.</NOTE>. <HI>Thou art not a God that hath plea&s;ure in wickdene&s;s; neither &s;hall evil dwell with thee: the fooli&s;h &s;hall not &s;tand in thy &s;ight; thou hate&s;t all workers of iniquity: the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al v. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE>. <HI>I am the Lord which exerci&s;e loving-kindne&s;s, judgment, and righteou&s;|ne&s;s in the earth; for in the&s;e things I delight, &s;aith the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. ix. 24.</NOTE>. <HI>For the righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, his countenance doth behold the up|right</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xi. 7.</NOTE>; <HI>he delighteth in his way</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxvii. 23.</NOTE>.

<P>GOD has formed us the proper &s;ubjects of moral laws. Both by the dictates of our na|ture, and by the precepts of his word, he has pre&s;cribed us laws. His having pre&s;cribed them nece&s;&s;arily implies that he will make a dif|ference

between the obedient and the di&s;obe|dient. The natural &s;en&s;e of good de&s;ert in virtue and of ill de&s;ert in vice, which in every man &s;hews it&s;elf in a variety of &s;hapes, is an expre&s;s declaration from him who formed us, that he will make the difference. He forces us to interpret and receive it as a certain intima|tion of his de&s;igns; apprehen&s;ion of puni&s;h|ment is in&s;eparable from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, but the reflection that we have done our duty in&s;pires the hope and expectation of re|ward. The &s;tate in which God has placed us, is adapted to our moral nature; it gives &s;cope for our voluntarily obeying or voluntarily tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his laws. His providence towards us in this &s;tate, is a plan of government by the&s;e laws. By the unalterable con&s;titution of things, what he requires tends to our peace and joy, what he forbids, to our di&s;quiet and pain: and by the di&s;po&s;itions of his provi|dence, they often actually produce the&s;e con|trary effects.

<P>SUCH are the native exertions of a pious re|gard to the judgment of God. According to the different &s;ituations of our own hearts, it will produce fear of di&s;plea&s;ure and puni&s;h|ment from him, or &s;orrow and &s;hame in the reflection that we have de&s;erved it; de&s;ire of approbation and reward, or hope and joy, in the thought that we are entitled to it. The&s;e unite their energies in the checquered temper of the good man, and mitigate and qualify one another. Amid&s;t all the faults of our na|ture, all the imperfections of our temper, and all the deviations of our conduct, de&s;ire and hope prevent our fears from degenerating into terror and de&s;pair, and our &s;orrow and humi|liation from &s;inking us into dejection and de|&s;pondence: and amid&s;t our mo&s;t &s;atisfying re|flections, and our &s;ublime&s;t pro&s;pects, the &s;en&s;e of our danger, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our innumerable failings, re&s;trains our hope from becoming pre&s;umptuous, and our joy from elating or throwing us off our guard. Derived from the &s;ame fountain, they again mix their &s;treams, and run forward in one even current. They form a temper in which
<PB N="270" REF="274">
&s;edatene&s;s and ardour, gravity, and cheerful|ne&s;s, circum&s;pection and &s;pirit, caution and confidence, are happily blended together. It is at once a barrier again&s;t heedle&s;sne&s;s and levity, and an incitement to activity and enter|pri&s;e. It is alike remote from the horrors of &s;uper&s;tition, and the &s;wellings of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>ALL the parts of this temper have the very &s;ame tendency; they impel us with their com|plicated force, to avoid every vice, for every vice is di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and incon&s;i&s;tent with his favour; and to practi&s;e every virtue, for every virtue is plea&s;ing to him, and will be rewarded by him. If this temper be real, it will be powerful: if it exi&s;t, it will be a ruling and leading principle; its influence will be di&s;cernible in the whole tenour of our behaviour; every act of vice, every neglect of duty proclaims &s;ome defect in our recollection, that <HI>the Lord is our judge.</HI> A lively &s;en&s;e of this will make us as &s;olicitous for the inno|cence of our mo&s;t &s;ecret actions, as for the blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e which are mo&s;t open. To be exempt from the ob&s;ervation and the cen&s;ure of men, is nothing: <HI>behold, I have &s;een it, &s;aith the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. vii. 11.</NOTE>; and <HI>I will recompence it</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 30.</NOTE>: <HI>the darkne&s;s hideth not from</HI> him, <HI>but the night</HI>

It will render us as attentive to the purity of our thoughts, as to the decency of our behaviour: they are alike expo&s;ed to the judgment of God. It will be the pre&s;ervative of &s;incerity; it will &s;ecure the conformity of our inten|tions to our profe&s;&s;ions, and of our princi|ples to our actions; it will force us to feel that hypocri&s;y is fooli&s;hne&s;s: by it ye may <HI>ju&s;tify your&s;elves before men, but God knoweth your hearts</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xvi. 15.</NOTE>; he <HI>&s;eeth not as man &s;eeth, he look|eth</HI> not <HI>on the outward appearance, but on the heart</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvi. 7.</NOTE>: and when <HI>the Lord &s;hall come, he will bring to light the hidden things of darkne&s;s, and will make manife&s;t the coun&s;els of the hearts</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 5.</NOTE>.

<P>A PREVAILING regard to the judgment of God, is the mo&s;t effectual antidote again&s;t in|fection from the erroneous opinions of men concerning good and evil. De&s;irous as we naturally are of avoiding their cen&s;ure, and obtaining their e&s;teem, both, whenever they
<PB N="272" REF="276">
are mi&s;placed, will appear de&s;picable to the man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that regard. Corrupt fa&s;hion, pre&s;uming to authorize what God di&s;|approves, or to explode what he approves, will be accounted but the &s;illy caprice of fools. Attempts to palliate or ju&s;tify any thing that is immoral, or to throw ridicule on any thing that belongs to virtue, will be neglected as no better than the ravings of in&s;anity. Wherever the misjudgings of erring mortals run counter to the e&s;timation of the infallible arbiter of right and wrong, they will be &s;lighted and de|rided. If every &s;en&s;ible man prefers the e&s;teem of a few able judges to the applau&s;es of an ignorant multitude, he mu&s;t be as de&s;titute of good &s;en&s;e as of religion, who can he&s;itate in preferring honour from God, to the good opi|nion of the whole univer&s;e. <HI>With me it is a very &s;mall thing that I &s;hould be judged of man's judgment: but he that judgeth me is the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 3. 4.</NOTE>. Every expectation, every apprehen&s;ion, that can be entertained in con&s;equence of the good or the ill opinion of men, vani&s;hes at the thought of what will re&s;ult from our being ac|quitted or condemned by God. <HI>They can only kill the body; be not afraid of them: but fear him who, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xii. 4, 5.</NOTE>.

<P>ALL the pre&s;ent plea&s;ures and advantages which &s;in can offer, will be unable to &s;educe the man who pre&s;erves a lively &s;en&s;e of the heavenly Judge: for they bear no proportion either to the happine&s;s which accompanies his approbation, or to the mi&s;ery which ari&s;es from his wrath. <HI>For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?

<HEAD>SERMON IX. THE CONFIDENCE OF THE RIGHTEOUS AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT the belief of the future judgment may the more effectually influence our conduct, the &s;criptures repre&s;ent it as a &s;olemn proce&s;s, attended with many &s;en&s;ible circum|&s;tances ea&s;ily and &s;trongly apprehen&s;ible. That it may give motion to all our &s;prings of ac|tion, they place it in a great variety of lights. Sometimes they de&s;cribe it as a tremendous event, fit to alarm our fears, and to enforce anxious vigilance and circum&s;pection. At other times they &s;et it forth as what good men have rea&s;on to <HI>love</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 8.</NOTE>, as <HI>the day of their re|demption</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, the commencement of their eternal

life, the pro&s;pect of which may comfort them amid&s;t their pre&s;ent &s;orrows, di&s;pel all tempo|rary fears, and produce alacrity and cheerful|ne&s;s in virtuous practice. It is in this light that my text has placed it. John, with an au|thority to which he was entitled both as an apo&s;tle and as an old man, and with a ten|derne&s;s of affection for which he was remark|able, addre&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians by the appellation of <HI>little children,</HI> and exhorting them to <HI>abide in Chri&s;t,</HI> to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith and practice of his religion, enforces the exhorta|tion by this argument, <HI>that when he &s;hall ap|pear, we may have confidence, and not be a&s;hamed before him at his coming.</HI> It is a very per&s;ua|&s;ive argument. The coming of the Son of God to judgment, is the terror of wicked men: they avoid the very thought of it as in&s;upportable; and in the hour of judgment, their &s;hame and confu&s;ion, their angui&s;h and mi&s;ery, will &s;urpa&s;s all that their terror had foreboded. Even good men cannot always look forward to it without painful concern. The po&s;&s;ibility of their not being fully pre|pared for a trial, the con&s;equences of which are everla&s;ting, mu&s;t at times excite &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ions in tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of many imperfections. To be able to <HI>look for the coming of the day of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. 12.</NOTE> with entire tran|quillity,
<PB N="277" REF="281">
to be qualified for welcoming its &s;o|lemnities with firmne&s;s and intrepidity, and for &s;tanding before the Lord, the righteous Judge, with boldne&s;s and joyful confidence that he will acquit us, and put us in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of all the joys of heaven: how invaluable is the privilege! By inviolable &s;incerity and per&s;evering diligence in univer&s;al holine&s;s, it may be certainly attained.</P>
<P>IT is this alluring, this animating motive to Chri&s;tian virtue, that I now propo&s;e to incul|cate on you. I propo&s;e to evince, that the &s;tedfa&s;t practice of it will give you a&s;&s;urance and joy at Chri&s;t's awful appearance to judge the world. In pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, I would lead you to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>FIRST, That Chri&s;tian virtue naturally pro|duces the&s;e effects in this world; and</P>
<P>SECONDLY, That the intention and the cir|cum&s;tances of Chri&s;t's appearance will &s;ecure its then producing them in an higher de|gree.</P>
<P>FIRST, That Chri&s;tian virtue will in&s;pire confidence and joy at the coming of Chri&s;t to judgment, we may fairly conclude from its
<PB N="278" REF="282">
naturally producing the&s;e effects in the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>THIS will not require a laboured proof: its evidence lies within your&s;elves; for perceiving it, you need only attend to what pa&s;&s;es in your own hearts when you reflect upon your conduct. You have experience that con&s;cience &s;ometimes approves, and &s;ometimes di&s;ap|proves you; and you cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that both its approbation and its di&s;approba|tion imply an anticipation, a pre&s;entiment of the con&s;equences of your actions, as well as a judgment concerning their nature. Its di&s;ap|probation includes not only regret and &s;orrow for our having done ami&s;s, but apprehen&s;ion al&s;o that we &s;hall &s;uffer for it. Its approba|tion includes not only plea&s;ure in the convic|tion that we have done right, but a &s;en&s;e that we de&s;erve well by what we have done, and hope that it will contribute &s;omething to our happine&s;s. Fearfulne&s;s is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to an evil con&s;cience, and confidence to a good con&s;cience, that by them the wi&s;e man cha|racterizes the vicious and the virtuous: <HI>The wicked flee when no man pur&s;ueth; but the righte|ous are bold as a lion</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 1.</NOTE>. Along with &s;atisfaction in reviewing the pa&s;t, a good con&s;cience be|gets tranquillity in the pro&s;pect of the future.
<PB N="279" REF="283">
It gives a &s;en&s;e of &s;ecurity; it infu&s;es hope, often even a&s;&s;urance, that it &s;hall be well with us. This is a part of that peace of mind, which it e&s;tabli&s;hes; this forms one di&s;tinction between it and every other joy; and to a rea|&s;onable creature, prone to look forward, inevi|tably &s;olicitous about what &s;hall befal him hereafter, this renders a good con&s;cience the mo&s;t important of all joys.</P>
<P>HOPE &s;prings &s;o naturally from con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of virtue, that a &s;ingle good action pro|duces &s;ome degree of it, though we know our|&s;elves to be very faulty in other particulars. We reckon our&s;elves &s;ecure, at lea&s;t as to the con&s;e|quences of that action. If it meet with prai&s;e, if it bring us honour or advantage, we accept them as our right: if it be mi&s;con&s;trued and cen&s;ured, we are di&s;appointed, we feel with indignation that we are injured, and hug our&s;elves in the &s;en&s;e of our integrity. It cheri&s;hes good hope, not only towards men, but al&s;o towards God: it leads us to expect his ble&s;&s;ing on it. The expectation is &s;o natural, that bad con&s;equences, proceeding from a well-intended and worthy action, have &s;ometimes &s;urprized even religi|ous per&s;ons into a momentary arraignment of the ju&s;tice of Divine Providence. It is &s;o na|tural, that it enables the man, who&s;e good deeds are traduced, or repaid with evil, to ap|peal
<PB N="280" REF="284">
to God for their rectitude, and fearle&s;sly to plead that he will vindicate them. In relation to the particular crimes with which David was fal&s;ely charged by his enemies, he often ad|dre&s;&s;es God, in words which &s;eem to befit only innocence: <HI>Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips; let my &s;entence come forth from thy pre&s;ence, let thine eyes behold the things that are equal: thou ha&s;t proved mine heart, thou ha&s;t tried me, and &s;halt find nothing</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xvii. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. <HI>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity: examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart: I will wa&s;h mine hands in inno|cency; &s;o will I compa&s;s thine altar, O Lord</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxvi. 1, 2. 6.</NOTE>. Of the like confidence towards God, dictated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity in &s;ome par|ticular in&s;tance of calumniated behaviour, we find examples every day. We have all expe|rienced it in our&s;elves. It is not confined to the uniformly virtuous.</P>
<P>BUT the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of uniform virtue, of genuine and habitual holine&s;s, produces a boldne&s;s and confidence of a more enlarged and important nature. A particular good ac|tion can give confidence only in re&s;pect of its proper con&s;equences: but univer&s;al and per|&s;evering
<PB N="281" REF="285">
goodne&s;s begets a &s;en&s;e of &s;ecurity in re&s;pect of the final re&s;ult of our whole beha|viour. It in&s;pires and it &s;u&s;tains the ble&s;&s;ed hope of a &s;tate of pure and permanent happi|ne&s;s. By the favour of him who made us, this glorious privilege is annexed to the up|right obedience of his will. By his appoint|ment in the moment of our creation, <HI>the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace; and the effect of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;urance for ever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxii. 17.</NOTE>. Sin|le&s;s obedience would produce full and unin|terrupted a&s;&s;urance of happine&s;s. But in every human brea&s;t, the &s;en&s;e of innumerable fail|ings, and of &s;ome heinous offences, rai&s;es doubts and apprehen&s;ions which often break the fulne&s;s of a&s;&s;urance. Yet &s;o great is the power of virtue, that the te&s;timony of con|&s;cience for the habitual &s;incerity of our hearts, can generally di&s;pel our fears, and &s;upport our expectation of approbation and reward from God, notwith&s;tanding the multitude of our imperfections. Encouraged by that te&s;ti|mony, we no longer tremble at the rigour of inexorable ju&s;tice; we look up to the indul|gence of divine mercy with humble confi|dence.</P>
<P>IT is only, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that lays a

&s;ure foundation for a guilty creature's confi|dence in God; it alone can render his tru&s;t rational and con&s;i&s;tent; it alone can warrant the &s;ons of men to a&s;pire to &s;o tran&s;cendent an happine&s;s as that of heaven. Yet &s;o con|genial is this confidence and tru&s;t to the vir|tuous &s;oul, that even into tho&s;e who were wholly ignorant of that di&s;pen&s;ation, a good con&s;cience has always infu&s;ed the hope of a future happine&s;s and of an happine&s;s greater than can be found on earth. The be&s;t of the heathens plea&s;ed them&s;elves with the expecta|tion, of living after death in the &s;ociety of all the great and good men of former ages. It was nature it&s;elf that rai&s;ed the expectation: the God of nature authorized it. The di&s;pen|&s;ation of redemption was decreed by him be|fore the world began: he had it in his eye when he created man: he adapted human na|ture to the whole of that &s;tate for which he de&s;igned human creatures: he framed its con|&s;titution with a reference to the &s;ecret inten|tions of his grace. He therefore impowered con&s;cience to &s;ugge&s;t to all good men, hopes which are unaccountable to mere rea&s;on, which can be ju&s;tified only by the revelation of a merciful di&s;pen&s;ation, rendering repent|ance available to the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and entitling our imperfect and unprofitable &s;er|vice

 &mdash;<HI>Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked &s;ervant.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE future judgment is in many re&s;pects awful to all men, and dreadful to the wicked. But no circum&s;tance renders it more dreadful to them than this, That in the day of judgment they &s;hall be &s;elf condemned. To be &s;elf-condemned is exqui&s;itely painful. The wicked &s;ometimes feel the torment of it in this world; they are always expo&s;ed to it: and when they &s;hall be called to judgment, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape it. This reflection binds down upon the guilty &s;oul all the ter|rors of that tremendous &s;ea&s;on, and mu&s;t be a powerful motive to that repentance and reform|ation which will deliver us from the ago|nies
<PB N="308" REF="311">
of guilt. The text naturally &s;ugge&s;ts it to our thoughts. It is part of a parable &s;poken by our Saviour. Alluding to the &s;tate of Judea, at that time a Roman province, parts of which were be&s;towed by the empe|rours on tributary princes, he repre&s;ents a no|bleman going into a far country, to receive a kingdom; calling his &s;ervants together before his departure; giving each of them a piece of money to improve during his ab&s;ence; re|turning after having received the kingdom; calling them to an account for the money which he had entru&s;ted to them; applauding tho&s;e who had improved it, and rewarding them in proportion to the degree of their im|provement; but condemning one who had hid the money in a napkin: fir&s;t, <HI>judging him out of his own mouth,</HI> and then commanding him to be puni&s;hed. The meaning of the parable is this: Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has a&s;cended into heaven, to receive from his Father the kingdom and dominion over all, and has left his followers to improve the advantages which they enjoy by their rea&s;onable and moral na|ture, and by revelation; will return at the end of the world, will call them and all mankind before his judgment-&s;eat, will munificently reward his faithful &s;ervants according to their de&s;erts, but will force the wicked to condemn them&s;elves out of their own mouths, their
<PB N="309" REF="312">
con&s;cience accu&s;ing them, anticipating their &s;entence, and bearing witne&s;s to its ju&s;tice. By &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on this mi&s;ery at pre|&s;ent, we may avoid it, we may be excited to for&s;ake tho&s;e &s;ins which will produce it, and, in the diligent practice of holine&s;s, obtain, in its &s;tead, the approbation of our own minds, brightening the &s;olemnity of the judgment into gladne&s;s, and a&s;&s;uring us of everla&s;ting happine&s;s as the i&s;&s;ue of our trial. May this be the effect, as it is the &s;incere de&s;ign, of the reflections which we propo&s;e to offer on the confu&s;ion and angui&s;h, which, at the coming of the Son of God to judgment, all the wicked &s;hall endure, in being &s;elf-condemned! That the&s;e reflections may, by the grace of God, produce conviction, I &s;hall &s;hew,</P>
<P>FIRST, That by the &s;tate of their minds in this world, the wicked are prepared for being &s;elf-condemned, and enduring all the horrors of guilt in the day of judgment; and,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, That the nature and circum|&s;tances of the judgment will awaken the &s;en&s;e of guilt, and rai&s;e the angui&s;h of their &s;elf|condemnation to extremity.</P>
<P>FIRST, To be convinced that wicked men cannot e&s;cape &s;elf-condemnation at the day of
<PB N="310" REF="313">
judgment, we need only con&s;ider what is the &s;tate of their minds in the pre&s;ent world. It cannot be better illu&s;trated, than by the ac|count which the wicked &s;ervant, cen&s;ured in this parable, gives of him&s;elf. <HI>Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, becau&s;e thou art an au|&s;tere man: thou take&s;t up that thou laid&s;t not down, and reape&s;t that thou did&s;t not &s;ow.</HI> His plea confutes it&s;elf. His conduct was the rever&s;e of what his profe&s;&s;ed opinion of his ma&s;ter's character naturally dictated. He knew that his lord would demand more than he had lent him; yet, by laying it up unemployed, he ren|dered it impo&s;&s;ible that he could return him more. Palpable as the incon&s;i&s;tence was, he never attended to it during the ab&s;ence of his lord: but he in&s;tantly convicted him by the very ju&s;tification which he offered, and cau&s;ed him feel that he had already condemned his own practice by his avowed &s;entiments: <HI>Thou knowe&s;t that I au&s;tere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not &s;ow: wherefore then gave&s;t thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with u&s;ury?</HI> The que&s;tion was unan|&s;werable; he was &s;ilenced and confounded. Perfectly &s;imilar is the condition of the wicked. Their practice is contradictory, though often they perceive it not, to their nature, to their
<PB N="311" REF="314">
principles, to what they are, to what they be|lieve, to what they profe&s;s; and is condemned by all the&s;e.</P>
<P>EVERY man has con&s;cience in his brea&s;t, to point out his duty, to command him to perform it, and to reprove him when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es it. Every man is &s;en&s;ible, and at times &s;hews, that he has con&s;cience, and that he has it for this very purpo&s;e. When it has lo&s;t the power of enforcing obedience to its dictates, it notwith&s;tanding continues long to excite a painful &s;en&s;e that they ought to be obeyed. Hence the &s;huddering reluctance which precedes the perpetration of iniquity; and hence the cutting remor&s;e which attends reflection on it. What &s;inner is there, who never had experience of the&s;e? Which of you dare &s;ay, that you were perfectly ea&s;y in your vices when you fir&s;t engaged in them, and till you had by habit gradually &s;teeled your heart again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of guilt? Or can the mo&s;t obdurate among you deny, that, after all your endeavours to elude the agonies of guilt, they &s;till break in upon you on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions? Indeed, if we &s;aw not the wicked at greater ea&s;e, than it is po&s;&s;ible to be, under the actual feeling of this &s;elf-torment, we could not doubt that they endured it con|&s;tantly, while they remained con&s;cious of impe|nitence

<P>WHILE &s;inners continue men, their nature pronounces them worthy of puni&s;hment; while they call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, their &s;aith &s;entences them to the pains of hell.

Is not this to acknowledge that we di&s;approve them, and know that they de&s;erve to be di&s;approved by all men? Or why do we condemn vice in others, often the very vice in which we indulge our&s;elves? What is this, but in judging another to give &s;entence again&s;t our&s;elves? The incon&s;i&s;tence is very common. The legi&s;lator enacts laws, and fixes heavy penalties again&s;t crimes in which him&s;elf lives. The magi&s;trate executes the laws on his fel|low-&s;ubjects for offences from which him&s;elf is by no means free; he pa&s;&s;es &s;entence on them for di&s;hone&s;ty, while him&s;elf is guilty of partiality, oppre&s;&s;ion, or corruption; he in|flicts death on the murderer, while him&s;elf &s;heds innocent blood under the forms of pub|lic ju&s;tice.

<P>IT is very true that, in this life, the wicked are not always &s;en&s;ible of their being &s;elf-con|demned. But can this be any &s;ecurity,&mdash;I will not &s;ay, again&s;t the judgment of God&mdash;but again&s;t the judgment of their own hearts hereafter? They are already actually &s;elf-con|demned: to make them &s;en&s;ible of it, is all that is wanting to render them mi&s;erable. If in this life they never became &s;en&s;ible of it, what would it avail them? A criminal un|der &s;entence of death may fall a&s;leep, and lo&s;e all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his condition; but is he therefore not condemned to death? or is it therefore impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould ever again reflect on his being condemned?

There are many objects in this world fit to divert or to blunt the feeling of their real &s;tate: but at the

re&s;urrection, the&s;e &s;hall be all removed; and what can ob&s;truct it then? The pre&s;ent tran|quillity of the &s;inner gives him no &s;ecurity again&s;t the tortures of an evil con&s;cience, even throughout this life. He needs only think &s;eriou&s;ly but for one hour, of what he is, and what he has done, to be wretched. On the mo&s;t incidental recollection of his more hei|nous &s;ins, regret, di&s;&s;atisfaction, &s;hame, terror, con&s;ternation, ri&s;e and &s;eize upon him, like tormenters let loo&s;e from hell, to puni&s;h him before the time. Often when he affects a cheerful countenance, often when none &s;u&s;pects his hidden woe, the fiends which haunt the guilty brea&s;t prey inwardly upon him, and make him mi&s;erable in his own reflections and forebodings. Can they fail then to invade him in the awful hour of his final judgment? They will a&s;&s;ault him with tenfold rage. Their wounds will be all empoi&s;oned with the cor|roding venom of de&s;pair.</P>

How changed from the pre|&s;ent world! In the pre&s;ent world, the objects of &s;en&s;e divert your thoughts from your&s;elves; the bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s engro&s;&s;es your attention, gaieties and amu&s;ements di&s;&s;ipate your reflec|tion; incon&s;ideration hides your real charac|ter from your eyes, the avocations of life turn off the angui&s;h which your &s;u&s;picions of it &s;ometimes threaten. But at the re&s;urrection, the phantoms have di&s;appeared; they find no place beyond the grave; they have left you di&s;|tracted for not having &s;ooner di&s;covered their de&s;tructive vanity. Even on earth, they could not always infatuate you into peace; your own heart knows, that guilt has &s;ometimes pierced it, like a &s;harp arrow, when there ap|peared no hand which let it fly; and when, ab&s;orbed in worldly cares, or di&s;&s;olved in the effu&s;e&s;t mirth, you &s;eemed to be &s;ecure from every wound: when then you ri&s;e naked from the grave, and can find no &s;hield; and when all things around you con&s;pire in impre&s;&s;ing you with your guilt, how certainly and how deeply &s;hall it lacerate your &s;ouls? To think, is to be mi&s;erable; and not to think, is impo&s;|&s;ible. In the pre&s;ent world, when the &s;inner is rou&s;ed from his thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and con|&s;trained
<PB N="321" REF="324">
&s;trained to reflect upon his ways, he can often elude the rebukes of con&s;cience by the chi|canery of &s;elf-deceit. He can per&s;uade him&s;elf that his &s;ins are &s;mall, and abate the &s;everity of remor&s;e; he can mi&s;repre&s;ent his vices as innocent, and &s;tifle the unea&s;y &s;en&s;e of them; he can confound them with virtue, and glory in what is in truth his &s;hame. But the bright|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t's coming will reveal all the illu|&s;ions of &s;elf-deceit. Every thing will appear as it really is. No fa&s;cination can hide or di&s;gui&s;e a &s;ingle crime. Every &s;in &s;tarts up in its genuine form; its ba&s;ene&s;s is written on it as with a &s;un-beam; no colouring can varni&s;h over its deformity; no philm can ob&s;truct the full perception of it. All the painted virtues of men, to their confu&s;ion, &s;hew them&s;elves real vices; their laborious religion is di&s;covered to have been but abject &s;uper&s;tition; their flaming zeal, but bigotry, bitterne&s;s, and cruelty; their prudence and frugality, ava|rice; their genero&s;ity, vanity, and profu&s;ion; their charity o&s;tentation; their rigid ju&s;tice, hard-heartedne&s;s and rancour. The pa&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s of their &s;elf-impo&s;ition adds to the bitter|ne&s;s of their reflections. We befool our&s;elves whenever we attempt to di&s;gui&s;e our vices from our&s;elves. It is to be willingly lulled into a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, which mu&s;t end in unex|pected ruin. In the pre&s;ent world, by conti|nuing
<PB N="322" REF="325">
to act in bold defiance to con&s;cience, the wicked can &s;tupify it, and &s;top its mouth from either inculcating their duty, or warning them of their danger. But the effrontery of the mo&s;t daring and abandoned &s;inner will fail when he is called to judgment. Though he could di&s;pute the commands of con&s;cience, and de&s;pi&s;e its threatenings of puni&s;hment, he finds that when the &s;ea&s;on for puni&s;hment is come, it inflicts it with a power that is irre|&s;i&s;tible. Pierced by its &s;tings, he writhes him|&s;elf in torture, he is embowelled with agonies; they are entwi&s;ted with the e&s;&s;ential principles of his frame.&mdash;The night is pa&s;t; the dark|ne&s;s which concealed him from his own eyes is over and gone; gone with them, and gone for ever his re&s;t and peace. He laments that ever he was at re&s;t; he bewails that ever he enjoyed peace in &s;in. It has forfeited his everla&s;ting peace. There is no longer a po&s;&s;i|bility of di&s;regarding the things which were un&s;een, and deemed remote, perhaps uncer|tain. The cau&s;e of di&s;regarding them has cea&s;ed. All other things have fled before the glories of the la&s;t day, like mi&s;t before the wind. The&s;e alone are pre&s;ent now; they are heard, and &s;een, and felt. The &s;inner was forewarned that he would be brought into judgment; he neverthele&s;s indulged him&s;elf in what he knew could not endure the trial;
<PB N="323" REF="326">
and he found means to evade the painful ap|prehen&s;ion of his condemnation, which might have re&s;trained him. But the &s;everer pain which he now endures, by what means can he evade?

He might have known what has now befallen him! He could not avoid &s;ometimes dreading it! He might have prevented it! But now it is inevitable! The reflection aggravates the tortures of remor&s;e and terror, to who&s;e united &s;ury his &s;epulchre has ca&s;t him out. Neither heaven nor earth, neither eternity nor time, contains aught that can alleviate his pain. The pa&s;t, the future, and the pre&s;ent con&s;pire to inflame it. The pa&s;t is a precious opportunity of obtaining eternal happine&s;s, wilfully lo&s;t, and lo&s;t for ever. The future di&s;clo&s;es only the certain pro&s;pect of puni&s;hment for having lo&s;t it. The pre&s;ent is full of agonizing reflections, and fearful apprehen&s;ions, and of objects cal|culated for driving them into his inmo&s;t &s;oul. It is the &s;tate of retribution, not the &s;tate of trial, into which he has ari&s;en. The appointed me&s;&s;enger has already proclaimed, <HI>that there &s;hall be time no longer</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. x. 6.</NOTE><HI>: he that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till; and he which is filthy, let him</HI>

In the mo|ment of deep remor&s;e for an atrocious &s;in, an awakened con&s;cience, &s;ometimes even in this life, repre&s;ents it as unpardonable: then it will declare with irre&s;i&s;tible per&s;ua&s;ivene&s;s, that every unfor&s;aken &s;in is in truth unpardonable. How dreadful is the mi&s;ery of guilt and de|&s;pair united! If guilt may become the mo&s;t un&s;ufferable torment that can &s;eize a man, even now when there is room for its being ex|piated, what will it be, when there is no more place for repentance? In vain would we attempt to expre&s;s to the full the torture which vice has often inflicted on the guilty mind; the inward pain which drove Adam to hide him&s;elf from God; the con&s;ternation which &s;hook Bel&s;hazzar at his idolatrous debauch; the angui&s;h which tore the traitor Judas when he hanged him&s;elf; the wretchedne&s;s which wrung the wicked emperour when he defied all the gods and godde&s;&s;es to make it greater. Much le&s;s can we put in words, that compli|cated agony which the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer at the la&s;t.

<P>THE whole world is a&s;&s;embled. The &s;inner beholds thou&s;ands, like him&s;elf, pale, trem|bling, agitated by the &s;ame unutterable ago|nies. Can the &s;ight make him forget him&s;elf, or ea&s;e the torment which ari&s;es from reflect|ing on him&s;elf? It mu&s;t be but a &s;light di&s;|tre&s;s, in which one can derive con&s;olation from his having fellow-&s;ufferers. The horrors of guilt admit no alleviation from companions in mi&s;ery; they are heightened by the &s;ight of them; it reverberates a man's reflections upon him&s;elf, and &s;harpens them. The &s;ight of an accomplice, though he betrayed no &s;ymptoms of a troubled con&s;cience; the conviction of another for a crime &s;imilar to their own, though they were in no danger of detection, has &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed the wicked into a re|collection of mi&s;deeds which they had long forgotten, and kindled a devouring fire within them.

<P>IN forming general conclu&s;ions from parti|cular in&s;tances, e&s;pecially when our expe|rience of the&s;e in&s;tances has not been uniform, great caution is nece&s;&s;ary, on every &s;ubject, to pre&s;erve us from mi&s;takes. But a peculiar degree of caution is nece&s;&s;ary in forming general maxims concerning <HI>characters;</HI> becau&s;e the circum&s;tances on which characters depend, are both more complicated, and more uncer|tain in their operation, than the cau&s;es of
<PB N="342" REF="344">
<HI>natural effects.</HI> On this account, ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be made on a very great number of in|dividuals, before we can judge with accuracy concerning the character of the nation or the profe&s;&s;ion to which the&s;e individuals belong: and even after we have made the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive ob&s;ervations, we ought &s;till to remember, that the maxim, which we form, far from be|ing an univer&s;al truth, will nece&s;&s;arily be liable to numberle&s;s exceptions.</P>
<P>IT is however undeniable, that there are few &s;ubjects on which men judge, either more ra&s;hly, or more dogmatically, than on the characters both of nations and of particular profe&s;&s;ions. They impute the faults which they have ob&s;erved in a few individuals, to a whole nation or order. They often al&s;o em|brace the groundle&s;s prejudice &s;o clo&s;ely, that, when they afterwards di&s;cover many other individuals, who appear to be free from the blemi&s;h which they had expected to find in them, they &s;uppo&s;e them to be tainted with it notwith&s;tanding, and take it for granted that it would become obvious in proper cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IN no in&s;tance has this &s;hameful prejudice been indulged more freely, than in forming a di&s;advantageous idea of the clergy in general,
<PB N="343" REF="345">
on account of the vices of &s;ome who have been members of that &s;ociety. And, becau&s;e mini&s;ters are the public teachers of chri&s;tianity, the vices imputed to them in a body, without evidence, have been con&s;idered as throwing a reflection on the truth or the efficacy of the religion which it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to publi&s;h. The charge has been commonly enforced by loo&s;e and popular declamation, fit to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the imagination of the thought|le&s;s, and, by con&s;equence, to gain their pa&s;|&s;ions to the party; but ab&s;olutely in&s;ufficient to convince the impartial and inqui&s;itive. If there be any difficulty in confuting the accu|&s;ations that are commonly brought again&s;t our order, and again&s;t the go&s;pel on our account, it ari&s;es, not from the &s;trength of the argu|ments by which they are &s;upported, but from the total want of argument.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t natural and direct method of proving, that the clergy de&s;erve the di&s;agree|able character which is &s;ometimes a&s;cribed to them, would doubtle&s;s be, to examine the temper and conduct of the &s;everal individuals, and to &s;hew, from an intimate knowledge of them, that the majority are really guilty of the vices imputed to the order. A candid en|quirer would likewi&s;e choo&s;e, before he pro|nounced &s;entence concerning their character
<PB N="344" REF="346">
on the whole, to compare them with the in|dividuals of other profe&s;&s;ions, and to &s;ee what proportion the virtues and the vices of the <HI>clergy</HI> bear to tho&s;e of the <HI>laity.</HI> It will &s;carcely be pretended, that this &s;pecies of proof has been attempted by tho&s;e who are &s;o liberal in their declamations again&s;t the vices of the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.&mdash;But though they could produce this proof in its greate&s;t &s;trength, it would &s;till be difficult to &s;hew, that the faults of mini&s;ters can be ju&s;tly charged on the Chri&s;tian religion, to the rules of which, it is manife&s;t, the&s;e faults are ab&s;olutely contrary. The moral tendency of the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and the purity and &s;ublimity of its pre|cepts, ought always to pre&s;erve it free from blame, on account of the vices of any who profe&s;s to believe it. Before the&s;e vices be imputed to the go&s;pel, it &s;hould certainly be &s;hown, that there is &s;ome doctrine, or precept, or example, recommended in Scripture, which gives countenance to them.</P>
<P>BUT though the method of proof which we have mentioned, be the mo&s;t natural and di|rect, upon a &s;ubject of this kind, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that another &s;pecies of rea&s;oning may be likewi&s;e u&s;ed.

recour&s;e in every argument to experience of in&s;tances preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that which we in|fer. It is often &s;ufficient, that the pre&s;ent ar|gument be &s;upported by &s;ome general maxims, which are clearly deducible from experience. We may conclude that a man who is intru&s;ted with ab&s;olute power, will probably abu&s;e it, not only from in&s;tances of tyrants who have abu&s;ed it, but al&s;o from the more general ob|&s;ervation of examples which occur of corrup|tion and in&s;olence in private life. In like manner could it be fairly proved, that there are circum&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to the mini&s;terial office, which, according to our general ob&s;er|vation of human nature, have a direct and primary tendency to produce certain vices in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e that office; and &s;hould it be inferred from this, that the&s;e vices will be characteri&s;tical of the order, and that the reli|gion which in&s;titutes the office, is the occa|&s;ion of them; we could not ju&s;tly refu&s;e to ad|mit the inference.

and he has endeavoured to prove, that this cha|racter naturally re&s;ults from the very genius of the mini&s;terial calling.<NOTE PLACE="foot">THIS is a repre&s;entation chiefly of the MORAL character of the clergy; and to that the following di&s;cour&s;e is wholly con|fined. But as an in&s;inuation is likewi&s;e made to the di&s;advan|tage of their INTELLECTUAL character, it will be proper to remark, that this in&s;inuation is, both of little weight, and, in a great mea&s;ure, without foundation.&mdash;&mdash;It is of little weight; for ta&s;te is more general among all men, than &s;kill in philo|&s;ophy. A greater number can judge of beauty, than of truth. Many are moved by the eloquence of a di&s;cour&s;e, who cannot examine the ju&s;tne&s;s of the rea&s;oning. We meet much oftener with a degree of imagination, and &s;en&s;ibility of temper, &s;ufficient to form a good &s;peaker, than with the penetration which is nece&s;&s;ary for inve&s;tigating the cau&s;es of things, and inventing ju&s;t theories. It can be no reflection on the clergy, that ta&s;te is more univer&s;al, than philo&s;ophical genius, in their profe&s;&s;ion, as well as in all other profe&s;&s;ions. Their ta&s;te will naturally be better in eloquence, than in other arts, becau&s;e their office leads them to apply e&s;pecially to that.&mdash;&mdash;In every &s;en&s;e, in which it can be con&s;idered as a reflection on our order, the in&s;inuation is entirely groundle&s;s. Were mankind per&s;uaded that we are unacquainted with the rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, and only quali|fied for popular declamation on principles taken for granted without enquiry; this might perhaps incline them to li&s;ten to tho&s;e who tell them, that the truths of religion, which we teach, are mere fables, de&s;titute of evidence, though we be not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a degree of rea&s;on &s;ufficient for detecting the fallacious ar|guments produced in &s;upport of them; it might prepare them for expecting wonderful di&s;coveries in the writings of infidels, and prejudice them again&s;t our vindications of religion. I will not &s;ay, that this author made the in&s;inuation with a de&s;ign to pro|mote this end, becau&s;e he has not informed us what is his de|&s;ign. But I will &s;ay, this end can be really promoted by nothing le&s;s, than a proof that the clergy are weak rea&s;oners, in com|pari&s;on with the re&s;t of mankind; and I will venture to affirm, that neither the nature of their employment, nor experience of their real character, gives rea&s;on for repre&s;enting them in this light. Their profe&s;&s;ion turns their attention to eloquence, but does not divert it from ju&s;t rea&s;oning. Their public functions lead them to employ all their powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, in incul|cating truth and goodne&s;s on their hearers; their &s;tudies lead them al&s;o to examine mo&s;t que&s;tions of importance, to enquire into the ab&s;tru&s;e&s;t truths, and to detect the mo&s;t &s;ubtle errors. Corruptions of religion, interwoven with the tenets of a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, have &s;ometimes retarded the improvement of &s;cience; but it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters to teach only pure religion; it is a perver&s;ion of their office to &s;upport corruptions of religion, and the effects of this perver&s;ion cannot ju&s;tly be imputed to the genuine &s;pirit of the office. In fact, the clergy have never been remarkably defective in the knowledge of philo&s;ophy. There have been periods, in which the philo&s;ophy of the times was almo&s;t wholly confined to them. When the &s;chola&s;tic philo|&s;ophy prevailed univer&s;ally, they di&s;covered as great &s;ubtlety, as men of other profe&s;&s;ions. As great a proportion of the clergy, as of any other cla&s;s, have excelled in the knowledge, both of nature, and of the human mind. It is natural for freethinkers to reckon the rea&s;onings of the clergy, concerning religion, weak and inconclu&s;ive, becau&s;e they are contradictory to their own; but we are not afraid to de&s;ire the world to compare the writings of men of our order, with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t admired infidels, in re&s;pect either of the truth of the principles, from which they argue, or of the &s;trength and clo&s;ene&s;s of the arguments.</NOTE></P>

The Apo&s;tle reminds <HI>Titus, ver.</HI> 5. that he had left him in <HI>Crete</HI> for this purpo&s;e, that he

might ordain elders or pre&s;byters in every city; men blamele&s;s, free not only from gro&s;s and &s;candalous wickedne&s;s, but from every &s;pecies of vice; for the word here u&s;ed has a re&s;pect to the judgment of God, and not merely to the &s;entiments of men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 1 Cor. i. 22.

A pre&s;byter is, by his office, <HI>a bi&s;hop,</HI> that is, <HI>an over&s;eer;</HI> and, ac|cording to the language of the New Te&s;tament, as appears from the only place where the term is u&s;ed in &s;uch a way, that its meaning can be preci&s;ely determined <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts, xv. 28.</NOTE>, <HI>an over&s;eer of all the flock, of the church of God.</HI> On this account, he <HI>mu&s;t be blamele&s;s:</HI> &s;teady and univer&s;al virtue, as far as it can be attained by human nature, is a qualification ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the exerci&s;e of his office.

Could his maxim be true, if that very office had an unalterable tendency to inflame many of the ba&s;e&s;t vices of human nature, and to produce a character which every good man mu&s;t regard with indignation? May not we, then, with &s;ufficient propriety, take occa&s;ion from this text to enquire, what is that temper which our employment, as mi|ni&s;ters of the go&s;pel, tends to cultivate in our &s;ouls?</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecuting this &s;ubject, I will, FIRST, enquire how far a tendency in the mini&s;terial office, to form a character in &s;ome re&s;pects di&s;|agreeable, or even a character expo&s;ed to the danger of becoming vicious, could rea&s;onably affect either the credit of that office, or the ex|cellence of the Chri&s;tian religion, in which the office is founded.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="357">SECONDLY, I will enquire, whether that character, which the mini&s;terial office tends to form, be virtuous or vicious on the whole.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, I will enquire, how far this of|fice has really a tendency to produce, or to inflame tho&s;e particular vices which &s;ome have repre&s;ented as characteri&s;tical of our order.</P>
<P>FIRST, I will enquire, how far a ten|dency in the mini&s;terial office, to form a cha|racter in &s;ome re&s;pects di&s;agreeable, or a cha|racter expo&s;ed to the danger of becoming vicious, could rea&s;onably affect either the credit of that office, or the excellence of the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>IT is not unu&s;ual to draw from an argu|ment, a conclu&s;ion totally different from that which it really proves; and, by means of the ambiguity of words, or the confu&s;ion of men's ideas, the fallacy often e&s;capes detection, and it is taken for granted that a propo&s;ition is proved, for which, in fact, there has not been a &s;ingle argument propo&s;ed. Attempts have been &s;ometimes made to &s;hew that the occupa|tion of mini&s;ters tends to prevent their acquir|ing that artificial poli&s;h, which adds graceful|ne&s;s to the behaviour of the higher ranks of

mankind: and when plau&s;ible evidence for this trivial charge has been produced, men have triumphed, as if they had demon&s;trated a very different propo&s;ition, that the character of our profe&s;&s;ion is po&s;itively di&s;agreeable, con|temptible, or ridiculous. In like manner, when men have produced &s;uch arguments as &s;eem to make it probable, that the turn of character and manners, which is promoted by the genius of the mini&s;terial office, will be unfit to engage the <HI>liking</HI> of the generality, or will be <HI>di&s;agree|able</HI> in &s;ome &s;ituations, they have taken it for granted, that the&s;e arguments prove with equal force, that this turn of character and manners is likewi&s;e po&s;itively <HI>vicious,</HI> and unfit to gain the inward <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> or the moral <HI>approbation</HI> of men.</P>
<P>A MODERATE degree of under&s;tanding might pre&s;erve a per&s;on from being deceived by &s;o|phi&s;ms &s;o palpable. But per&s;ons of good un|der&s;tanding are often not &s;o ready to exert a very &s;mall degree of reflection, as to receive every thing, without examination, which can gratify their own pride, or afford them mirth, by repre&s;enting others as proper objects of con|tempt or ridicule. For this rea&s;on, the&s;e argu|ments, or others equally inconclu&s;ive, have in fact occa&s;ioned a great part of the contempt, which has been poured out upon the clergy.

It will not, therefore, be unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, though the remark be extremely obvious, that a character not only may be agreeable, when many agreeable qualities are wanting in it, becau&s;e the mere ab&s;ence of them gives no po|&s;itive di&s;gu&s;t; but al&s;o may be really di&s;agree|able, or unfit to engage a general liking, and yet be &s;o far from vicious, that it &s;hall, on the contrary, command the moral approbation, and force the good opinion, and even the ve|neration of mankind.</P>
<P>As characters and actions may be con&s;idered in various lights, they may gratify a &s;pec|tator, by &s;entiments totally di&s;tinct and dif|ferent. The&s;e &s;entiments are very apt to be confounded, becau&s;e they are all agreeable; but every man who de&s;ires to think with accuracy, mu&s;t be at pains to pre&s;erve them &s;eparate. A <HI>liking</HI> to a character is very different from the <HI>approbation</HI> or <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of it. The former &s;enti|ment is excited chiefly by the more trivial ac|compli&s;hments of the man; the latter, only by &s;uch as are important. The qualities, which mo&s;t effectually engage the liking of the gene|rality, are of too low an order to be regarded as being even a-kin to the moral virtues: nay, there are &s;ome <HI>vices,</HI> which, becau&s;e they diffu&s;e a certain ea&s;e, and gaiety, and &s;prightline&s;s over the temper and behaviour, are very apt
<PB N="358" REF="360">
to obtain the liking even of tho&s;e, in whom a moment of reflexion produces abhorrence of their ba&s;ene&s;s. But it is only &s;olid virtue, rooted deep in the temper, and exerted regularly in the conduct, that can either gain or pre&s;erve the real inward approbation and e&s;teem of man|kind. It likewi&s;e de&s;erves to be remarked, that a man's own turn of character has great in|fluence in determining the objects of his like|ing, who will be tho&s;e chiefly who&s;e manners re&s;emble his own; and therefore this &s;entiment will be variable and precarious. Approbation is more permanent and univer&s;al, and le&s;s de|pendent on the peculiarities of temper; it is often be&s;towed unwillingly by men, on tho&s;e to whom their own con&s;ciences tell them, to their angui&s;h, that them&s;elves bear no &s;imili|tude.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE now, my fathers and brethren, that &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, in writing or in con|ver&s;ation, that our office deprives us of oppor|tunities for acquiring that exterior poli&s;h of manners, which is very acceptable to the gene|rality, and indeed graceful in it&s;elf. This is really the whole amount of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;u|perficial reflexions which are often thrown out again&s;t us.

not only that we are obnoxious to it, but al&s;o that it doth detract from the credit of our office; for he mentions good breeding and openne&s;s of behaviour, as one of the amiable qualities which enter into the character of a &s;oldier, and are naturally derived from his way of life; and he tells us, that the character of a clergyman, as well as his way of life, is, in mo&s;t points, oppo&s;ite to that of a &s;oldier.&mdash;Need we be much concerned to enquire, whether the charge be true or fal&s;e?

It is a&s;&s;erted by others, and it is not di&s;&s;embled by our&s;elves, that our office tends to form us to a grave and &s;erious temper, that it di&s;|courages the gaiety of plea&s;ure and unthinking levity of behaviour, that it confines us to &s;trict rules of decency, that it leads us to &s;et a guard over our looks, and words, and actions, and re&s;trains us from giving &s;cope to our natural movements and &s;entiments, whenever they are either &s;inful or unbecoming.&mdash;I do not know but there are &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons in which the generality would di&s;like a man of this character, and &s;hun his company. But it would be only when they were di&s;po&s;ed to ex|ceed the limits of right and innocence. And could it be inferred, from his being di&s;agree|able to them in this &s;ituation, that his charac|ter is vicious, or even that they who di&s;like him, do not really approve and e&s;teem him not|with&s;tanding? I doubt not but a per&s;on of the character, which we have de&s;cribed, will be, in all &s;ituations, di&s;agreeable to many. He bears no re&s;emblance, in his manners, to the gay, the di&s;&s;ipated, and the voluptuous; and his pre&s;ence would lay them under an unea&s;y re&s;traint. They will always <HI>di&s;like</HI> him: but is it certain, that even they will always <HI>di&s;approve</HI> him? Or if they &s;hould, would it be of mighty con|&s;equence?

then, that our office naturally produces a turn of character which is di&s;agreeable in &s;ome re|&s;pects; will either the credit of that office, or the excellence of our religion, &s;uffer by this charge, if we be able to vindicate our calling from a temper, that is really vicious, or moral|ly evil?</P>
<P>FARTHER, brethren, is it ab&s;olutely cer+tain, that every tendency in the mini&s;terial function, to produce &s;ome real vices in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, will nece&s;&s;arily detract from its credit, or be incon&s;i&s;tent with the perfect purity of the go&s;pel? An a&s;&s;ertion or in&s;inua|tion of this nature is plau&s;ible indeed: yet it may be proved, that it ought not to be ad|mitted but under &s;everal limitations.&mdash;Were it the direct and primary tendency of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to form a vicious character, or to in|flame &s;ome heinous vices, this would certainly reflect di&s;honour on it. This would render ours an unlawful calling, becau&s;e we could not exerci&s;e it, without doing what is wrong. Were there, for in&s;tance, any e&s;&s;ential part of our office which we could not execute, with|out impo&s;ing <HI>cunningly devi&s;ed fables</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 16.</NOTE> on the credulity of mankind, or fo&s;tering a &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition among them, or offering violence
<PB N="362" REF="364">
to their con&s;ciences, our employment would be &s;o far ab&s;olutely immoral. This would al&s;o reflect di&s;honour on our religion; for that re|ligion could not be true, or holy, or divine, which it were impo&s;&s;ible to teach without com|mitting &s;in. Let it be clearly proved, that &s;omething unlawful mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> be prac|ti&s;ed in teaching the doctrines, or inculcating the duties of genuine, <HI>uncorrupted chri&s;tianity:</HI>&mdash;by this, indeed, but by nothing le&s;s than this, our office and our religion will be expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>IF any per&s;on &s;hould di&s;cover that, though our office tend <HI>primarily</HI> to form and improve a virtuous character, it has a remote and <HI>&s;econd|ary</HI> tendency to produce vicious di&s;po&s;itions in tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t its original impul&s;e; we may give him liberty to avail him&s;elf of the di&s;|covery as much as he can with rea&s;on. The amount of the di&s;covery is only this, that the be&s;t things may be abu&s;ed, that what is naturally calculated for the worthie&s;t purpo&s;e may be perverted, and, after it is perverted, rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to an unworthy and contrary end. This is, in|deed, an univer&s;al truth. Rea&s;on is a noble faculty, implanted in our nature, on purpo&s;e to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;e|hood: but a &s;uperior degree of rea&s;on has been often employed to di&s;gui&s;e plain truths, and
<PB N="363" REF="365">
to render errors plau&s;ible. Natural affection is an amiable in&s;tinct, de&s;igned to prompt the parent, to provide for the helple&s;s infant, and to &s;ubmit to all the fatigues which may be nece&s;&s;ary for in&s;tilling knowledge and virtue into the opening mind: yet it frequently de|generates into a vicious &s;endne&s;s, which occa|&s;ions the death, or prevents the education of the child. The primary end of ingenuous &s;hame and regard to reputation plainly is the prevention of infamous vices: but does not this very principle often l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ad m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n to commit one act of wickedne&s;s in order to conceal ano|ther which they have already perpetrated in &s;ecret? In a word, nothing can have &s;o &s;trong a tendency to promote a good end, but it may be perverted to &s;erve a bad, or even a con|trary purpo&s;e. Are we then to judge of things by their primary and e&s;&s;ential tendency, or by that accidental direction which they acquire when they have been abu&s;ed? By the former, certainly. If it is not &s;ufficient that the pri|mary tendency of a thing be good, if it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e, that it be incapable of perver|&s;ion or abu&s;e; there will be nothing good or wi&s;e in art or nature; there will be no &s;itua|tion or employment in the world &s;afe or law|ful, for there is none from which men may not take occa&s;ion to fall into vicious conduct. And is it fair or rea&s;onable to in&s;i&s;t, that more is requi&s;ite for the vindication of the pa&s;toral of|fice

than of any thing be&s;ides? Are tho&s;e vices to be charged on the office, which &s;pring only from the abu&s;e of it? Are they not rather to be imputed &s;olely to the faults of indivi|duals?</P>
<P>WHEN therefore any per&s;on a&s;&s;erts, that there are circum&s;tances in the pa&s;toral office which tend to inflame any particular vice, it is incumbent on him to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully between the primary and the accidental ten|dency of the&s;e circum&s;tances. If the tendency be but accidental, to urge it to the di&s;advan|tage of the office, is, either inadvertently or artfully, to confound things totally di&s;tinct, and thus to render a fal&s;ehood plau&s;ible, or to give a harmle&s;s truth an unfavourable a&s;pect: it is like hurting a man's reputation by an in|&s;inuation which will very probably be mi&s;un|der&s;tood, and which could do no hurt except it were mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, that there are certain vices of which mini&s;ters are often guilty, and into which they are led by their profe&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e it were alleged, as an in&s;tance of this, that when mini&s;ters are con&s;cious of their wanting &s;ome virtue which the decorum of their character requires, they are apt to affect the outward appearance of that virtue.
<PB N="365" REF="367">
Such mini&s;ters are, no doubt, guilty of hypo|cri&s;y. It may be affirmed too, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, that their profe&s;&s;ion is the occa&s;ion of this hypocri&s;y; becau&s;e their being con&s;cious that their profe&s;&s;ion requires the virtue which they affect, is their motive in making fal&s;e pretences to it. But is it not plain that in this ca&s;e, the &s;pirit of the office leads them <HI>naturally,</HI> not to <HI>affect</HI> the virtue, but really to <HI>cultivate</HI> it? It can be &s;aid to lead to hypocri&s;y, only by <HI>acci|dent,</HI> by being perverted from its original and proper aim; and its being thus perverted, far from implying that it has an immoral ten|dency, &s;ets the &s;trength of its tendency to vir|tue in the cleare&s;t light; for it &s;hows, that the mini&s;terial office prompts men &s;o powerfully to the culture of virtue, that even they who re&s;i&s;t its impul&s;e, and over whom it has the lea&s;t power, mu&s;t palliate their want of real virtue, to them&s;elves and others, by an hypo|critical &s;how of goodne&s;s.</P>

If the common temptations of life be not &s;ufficient to over|turn the belief of a God and a providence, tho&s;e which are peculiar to the pa&s;toral office, cannot affect the truth or the excellence of the go&s;pel. Let none therefore throw blame on the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, on account of its &s;upplying &s;ome temptations to vice, or on the go&s;pel, becau&s;e it has e&s;tabli&s;hed an office, which is liable to abu&s;e, but tho&s;e who have already embraced athei&s;m, and denied the con&s;titution of the world to be wi&s;e and good.&mdash;Mankind are at pre&s;ent, by the univer&s;al appointment of God, in a &s;tate of trial and exerci&s;e. There is no circum&s;tance in life, but gives us opportunities of acting either virtuou&s;ly or viciou&s;ly. It is only by putting it in our power to act viciou&s;ly if we choo&s;e, that any &s;ituation can exerci&s;e or improve our virtuous affections. Exerci&s;e is afforded to out temper, not only by the general circum|&s;tances of life, common to all men, but like|wi&s;e by the peculiar circum&s;tances of particu|lar profe&s;&s;ions. There are peculiar circum|&s;tances in the mini&s;terial office, as well as in every other, which may give exerci&s;e to our virtues, and improve them, but may likewi&s;e,
<PB N="369" REF="371">
as is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, prove occa&s;ions of vice. To a&s;&s;ert this, is only to &s;ay, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are in a &s;tate of probation and di&s;cipline, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as other men; that their employment, as well as other employments, contains circum&s;tances fit to draw out virtuous principles, and to give them exerci&s;e; and this &s;urely can dero|gate nothing from the excellence of their office.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e that the vices of a wicked mi|ni&s;ter ri&s;e higher, in particular in&s;tances, and become more atrocious than tho&s;e of others: this is &s;o far from <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> implying an im|moral tendency in his office, that, on the contrary, it <HI>may</HI> really proceed from the &s;trength of its virtuous tendency; for the greater the advantages which this office af|fords for virtuous practice, the greater will be the depravity nece&s;&s;ary for abu&s;ing them, and the more heinous and inveterate the corrup|tion which will &s;pring from the abu&s;e.&mdash;As the &s;ame vicious principle may a&s;&s;ume dif|ferent forms, and be exerted in different ways, &s;ome forms and exertions of it are often more dete&s;table and pernicious than others. If, then, &s;ome vicious principle &s;hould a&s;&s;ume its blacke&s;t form, in the practice of a clergyman who fo&s;ters it; and if it &s;hould appear to be

determined to that form by the circum&s;tances of his occupation; can we arraign the &s;pirit of his office on this account? This were to judge of that office only by the abu&s;e of it. But do not all men admit it for a maxim, that tho&s;e things are generally the be&s;t in them&s;elves, the corruption of which is the wor&s;t?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again, that the employment of a mini&s;ter contains circum&s;tances which will lead to vicious conduct, if the greate&s;t caution be not exerci&s;ed: this would not nece&s;&s;arily prove even that vice will be more common among mini&s;ters than among other ranks of men; much le&s;s would it prove, that the &s;pi|rit of the office is, on the whole, friendly to vice; for it may contain other circum&s;tances which prompt &s;trongly to exert the nece&s;&s;ary caution, to re&s;i&s;t the importunities of vice, and to cultivate every virtue. The mini&s;terial office may, from its being abu&s;ed and per|verted by the weakne&s;s or corruption of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, or from various circum&s;tances in this &s;tate of probation in which it is to be executed, &s;upply temptations which have a direct and powerful tendency to excite a pa&s;|&s;ion or inclination, the indulgence of which will lead the negligent into vicious conduct. If this could throw a reflection on the &s;pirit of that office, or on the Chri&s;tian religion which
<PB N="371" REF="373">
has in&s;tituted it, how could we vindicate the ordinary &s;ituations in which God places us, or the general plan of his providence towards us in the pre&s;ent world? Many objects in na|ture excite pa&s;&s;ions which crave gratification often when it is vicious to gratify them. Were man formed for following thoughtle&s;sly the pre&s;ent inclination, the&s;e objects would infal|libly lead him into vice. But we mu&s;t take the whole of human nature into the account; man is endued with a moral principle, a principle of reflection, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to re&s;train inclination whenever it cannot be indulged lawfully. His &s;tate is &s;uited to his whole nature. The temptations of life are de&s;igned to give him opportunities of exerting reflection, of acting with moral attention to his conduct, and are &s;it to &s;trengthen, by this means, the principle of reflection, and im|prove a habit of &s;elf-government, which is the great &s;ecurity of virtue. They who will not exerci&s;e reflection and employ care, in con|trouling their inclinations, fall before tempta|tions through their own fault, are hardened in vice by means of them, and thus render them &s;ub&s;ervient to a contrary end from that which God has de&s;igned and &s;itted them to an&s;wer. This is the general con&s;titution of the world, yet the Creator is wife, and good, and perfect. The office of a Chri&s;tian minif|ter,
<PB N="372" REF="374">
in like manner, &s;upplies temptations, with which many comply, and which it requires a great degree of care and attention to re&s;i&s;t; yet that office may be de&s;igned for the virtu|ous improvement of tho&s;e who occupy it, its &s;pirit may tend &s;trongly to promote that im|provement; and the religion which in&s;titutes that office, may be holy and divine, for it is indeed analogous to the whole plan of provi|dence.</P>
<P>I WILL make one &s;uppo&s;ition more, and that as favourable to our adver&s;aries as they can rea&s;onably de&s;ire. I will &s;uppo&s;e that the office of a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter expo&s;es him to greater danger of acting viciou&s;ly than other men. Even this &s;uppo&s;ition will not avail them much. In this ca&s;e our &s;tation would indeed be hazardous to our&s;elves: as a few &s;oldiers are &s;ometimes forced to defend a de&s;perate po&s;t, in order to pre&s;erve a whole army from de&s;truction, &s;o we &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to an imminent danger of lo&s;ing our own &s;ouls, in promoting the &s;alvation of others. But even this would not prove, that our office has an immoral tendency, in any &s;en&s;e which could affect the credit of our re|ligion. It would be only analogous to what happens in the cour&s;e of nature, that &s;ome &s;ituations &s;upply &s;tronger and more numerous
<PB N="373" REF="375">
temptations than others; and therefore it could never prove, that the go&s;pel is not de|rived from the Author of nature.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations appeared to be nece&s;&s;ary for removing the confu&s;ion in which the charge again&s;t the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion has been commonly involved, and for enabling us to detect &s;ome of the artifices by which it has been rendered plau&s;ible, and &s;eemingly im|portant. The &s;um is this. If the enemies of our order only prove, that our office tends to form a character in which &s;ome agreeable qualities are wanting, or even a character po|&s;itively di&s;agreeable in &s;ome re&s;pects; or if they prove, that &s;ome circum&s;tances in it may be perverted into occa&s;ions of vice, or that it pre&s;ents peculiar temptations which it will require great caution to avoid complying with, they allege nothing which can ju&s;tly affect either the &s;pirit of our office, or the re|ligion by which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. If they can prove no more, they attack us with in&s;ufficient weapons, we may expo&s;e our bo&s;oms to their pointle&s;s arrows without receiving the &s;lighte&s;t hurt. They &s;how their inclination to annoy us; and the undi&s;cerning and the prejudiced may take it for granted, that they have given a mortal wound to religion and its mini&s;ters.

<P>WITH a view to di&s;cover what is the real &s;pirit of the mini&s;terial office, we pro|po&s;ed, &s;econdly, to enquire, whether that cha|racter which it tends to form, be virtuous or vicious on the whole?</P>
<P>OUR office is charged expre&s;sly, only with &s;ome particular vices: but the&s;e are &s;o heinous and &s;o numerous, and &s;oftened by the mixture of &s;o few virtues, that, were the charge &s;up|ported with &s;ufficient evidence, it would im|ply, that the natural character of a clergyman is, upon the whole, vicious and dete&s;table. I doubt not however but it will appear, by every kind of evidence of which the &s;ubject can be &s;uppo&s;ed capable, that a character, in all re&s;pects virtuous, is the natural re&s;ult of our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MAY it not be a&s;&s;erted, in the fir&s;t place, with con&s;iderable evidence, that the clergy in general are in fact equal, nay &s;uperior to other cla&s;&s;es of men, in whatever de&s;erves the name of moral virtue? And if this be true,
<PB N="376" REF="378">
will it not form an argument in favour of the genius of our calling? For if it really led to vice, it could &s;carce fail to corrupt the greater number. It is not ea&s;y to prove beyond di&s;|pute, what depends upon &s;o many in&s;tances, what requires the ob&s;ervation of many ages and nations; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, on this occa|&s;ion, to enter on a long detail from hi&s;tory, to &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion: but let any per&s;on exa|mine with impartiality, and he will find that, in every &s;tate of things, mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have had their full proportion of the virtue of the times. In the be&s;t and the mo&s;t virtuous ages, there have been more of this order emi|nent for virtue, in proportion to the number of tho&s;e who belong to it, than of any other. In the mo&s;t degenerate times, when religion has been mo&s;t perverted from its true de&s;ign, the morals of the clergy have been higher than on a level with tho&s;e of the laity. If there be any period, in which it has been otherwi&s;e, let our adver&s;aries point it out.&mdash;We own they have great advantages on their &s;ide.&mdash;The mini&s;terial office leads to privacy and re|treat; the abu&s;es of it often carry a man into public life. On this account, the vices of tho&s;e clergymen, who have departed from the genius of their office, are con&s;picuous, and liable to be expo&s;ed by the torch of hi&s;tory: but they who have been &s;teddily actuated by
<PB N="377" REF="379">
its genuine &s;pirit, have pa&s;&s;ed through life in a virtuous ob&s;curity, revered by tho&s;e who knew them, their memory honoured for a ge|neration or two, but totally unregarded by hi&s;tory, which confines it&s;elf to the actions of the higher ranks of men, or to tho&s;e ac|tions which had an influence on the revolu|tions of government, or on the general &s;tate of civil affairs.&mdash;It will likewi&s;e de&s;erve attention, that in &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hments of re|ligion, many clergymen have not been con|fined to the proper functions of their office, but have devoted them&s;elves chiefly to &s;ecular affairs, perfectly foreign to it. It is not in the&s;e that we can expect to find the genuine character of the order; for the pa&s;toral office cannot po&s;&s;ibly exert its influence on a man who is &s;carce at all employed in the duties of it. The temper of &s;uch a per&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be formed, principally by tho&s;e &s;ecular occupations in which he is mo&s;t conver&s;ant.

a clergyman, are depre&s;&s;ed far below their genuine dignity; and at the &s;ame time many vices, frequent among other ranks of men, but rarely to be found among the clergy, are regarded with a more favourable eye than their real deformity de&s;erves. This perver|&s;ion of moral &s;entiment, if it be not guarded again&s;t, will nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h the merit of the clergyman, and rai&s;e that of the man of the world, and thus di&s;gui&s;e their true propor|tion to each other.&mdash;But let our adver&s;aries take no more advantage from the&s;e or other circum&s;tances, than them&s;elves can approve as fair; let them examine what has been the real character of the clergy, not by &s;electing a few in&s;tances on one &s;ide only, but by making a complete and impartial induction; let them make the &s;ame allowance in this ca&s;e, that they would reckon rea&s;onable in other ca&s;es; let them form their judgment chiefly from tho&s;e clergymen, who have been employed only in the proper duties of their calling; at lea&s;t let them di&s;tingui&s;h, in others, between the vices which belong to them as clergymen, and tho&s;e which have &s;prung from their ad|ventitious occupations; let the &s;everal virtues, and their oppo&s;ite vices be valued, I will not &s;ay, according to the Chri&s;tian &s;tandard, but according to that &s;tandard which the unper|verted &s;entiments of mankind have fixed, and
<PB N="379" REF="381">
the be&s;t heathen morali&s;ts have acknowledged; let them tell us hone&s;tly the re&s;ult of their en|quiry. If they &s;hould find, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have been, upon the whole, more blamele&s;s, more virtuous than the re&s;t of man|kind, that they have for the mo&s;t part fallen in late&s;t with a prevailing corruption of manners, that they have often oppo&s;ed its progre&s;s, and been lea&s;t infected with it, that &s;ometimes the majority of them have totally e&s;caped the contagion of vice which raged among other ranks; they cannot deny that the mini&s;terial office has a &s;trong tendency to promote the practice of univer&s;al virtue.</P>
<P>THAT the re&s;ult of their enquiry will be what we have &s;uppo&s;ed, I pronounce with the greater confidence, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be really acknowledged by all mankind. It is an un|deniable matter of fact, that the general &s;en&s;e of mankind proclaims vice to be peculiarly &s;candalous, and virtue to be peculiarly requi&s;ite in a clergyman. They who pay little regard to the laws of morality in their own conduct, demand the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s virtue in the teachers of religion. Every deviation from &s;trict vir|tue, every in&s;tance of vice in men of this pro|fe&s;&s;ion, has always excited greater and more general indignation, than &s;imilar faults in others. Whence does this univer&s;al &s;entiment
<PB N="380" REF="382">
ari&s;e? It can ari&s;e from no cau&s;e which is not obvious to the very &s;en&s;es of mankind; for circum&s;tances which cannot be di&s;covered with|out clo&s;e attention and deep penetration, will never affect the generality: their &s;entiments and judgments are produced only by plain matters of facts. And from what cau&s;e can their &s;entiment on this &s;ubject ari&s;e, but actual experience of the &s;uperior virtue of Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters? Familiar objects never &s;trike us &s;trongly. Vices, which we are accu&s;tomed to witne&s;s, we &s;oon learn to behold without a great degree of horror. Were a vicious mi|ni&s;ter very common, men mu&s;t have long ago regarded him with as little indignation as other vicious men. They are peculiarly &s;hocked with vice in a clergyman, for this rea&s;on, be|cau&s;e they do not find it &s;o frequently in men of this character as in others.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;entiment of the peculiar un&s;uit|ablene&s;s of vice to the profe&s;&s;ion of a clergy|man de&s;erves to be con&s;idered farther; for not only do mankind, by means of it, give te&s;timony that virtue is more general among mini&s;ters than among others, but it likewi&s;e contains a <HI>direct</HI> proof, that the genius of our calling is eminently favourable to virtue. It &s;uppo&s;es that all the world is &s;en&s;ible, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have, from the very
<PB N="381" REF="383">
nature of their office, peculiar advantages for being virtuous. If this were not taken for granted, men could never deem vice peculiarly atrocious in a clergyman, they could never exact uniform virtue more rigorou&s;ly from him than from any other per&s;on. When the &s;ituation in which a man is placed, lays him under &s;trong temptations to vice, we make allowance for it in our cen&s;ure of him. We excu&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;allies of youth, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions are violent at that time of life. We give &s;ome indulgence to the peevi&s;h|ne&s;s of old age, becau&s;e the infirmities inci|dent to that period are powerful temptations to ill humour. We pity, rather than blame a wretch who, overcome by torture, betrays his friend. The judgment is natural, nece&s;|&s;ary, and well founded. The vices on which we are di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s a heavy cen&s;ure, are tho&s;e which a man commits without any in|ducement from his &s;ituation, tho&s;e which he is under a &s;trong obligation to avoid, and has great advantages for avoiding. When all men, therefore, perceive vice to be incongru|ous to the character of a clergyman, is not this a confe&s;&s;ion, that his &s;acred function has a pe|culiar fitne&s;s for forming him to virtue? Be|lievers and infidels agree in the &s;entiment on which our argument is founded, and therefore mu&s;t equally perceive its force. The natural
<PB N="382" REF="384">
&s;entiments even of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t forward to cen&s;ure the &s;pirit of our office, pronounce vice peculiarly odious, and virtue peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in a clergyman; and the&s;e &s;entiments, ari&s;|ing &s;pontaneou&s;ly and irre&s;i&s;tibly in their hearts, are a much &s;tronger proof of their being con&s;cious of the moral tendency of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, than any refined argu|ments, formed at lei&s;ure, can be of the con|trary. Let them either acknowledge, that our office urges us powerfully to all virtue, or let them regard tho&s;e vices which they charge upon it, as more venial and excu&s;eable, as le&s;s worthy of di&s;approbation in a cler|gyman, than in another.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this topic, allow me to make one ob&s;ervation, which &s;eems to be of import|ance in e&s;timating the real character of a cler|gyman. It is the judgment of human nature, that every vice has a &s;ingular atrocity in him; this judgment could not be formed, except vice were comparatively rare in that profe&s;|&s;ion, and likewi&s;e ab&s;olutely repugnant to its genuine &s;pirit; yet this very judgment has contributed not a little to be&s;tow plau&s;ibility on the a&s;&s;ertion, that the &s;pirit of our profe&s;|&s;ion is immoral, an a&s;&s;ertion to which it is al|together contradictory. The con&s;equence of this judgment has been, that, while very <HI>high degrees</HI> of vice are overlooked in other men,
<PB N="383" REF="385">
or, at mo&s;t, are &s;lightly blamed, the <HI>lea&s;t appear|ance</HI> of every vice in a clergyman is immedi|ately remarked and &s;everely condemned. By this means a few &s;mall vices in him appear both greater and more numerous, than many atro|cious vices in another, becau&s;e they are more certainly ob&s;erved, and more heavily cen&s;ured. A per&s;on is highly di&s;approved, when he bears the character of a clergyman, who would have been noways cen&s;ured, if he had be|longed to any other order. Thus the very tendency of the mini&s;terial office to promote virtue has led men, fir&s;t to think mini&s;ters more vicious in compari&s;on with others, than they really are; and next, in con&s;equence of this, to charge the office it&s;elf with a tendency to vice. We own that mankind do us no in|ju&s;tice in reckoning vice more heinous in us, than in others; but the judgment &s;uppo&s;es the &s;pirit of our office to be eminently favour|able to virtue; and therefore a per&s;on cannot fairly avail him&s;elf of it, who denies this, and is examining the real characters of clergymen, in order to determine, whether the &s;pirit of their office be moral or immoral; he ought to e&s;timate <HI>their</HI> actions only by that &s;tandard, which he applies to the actions of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, it is worth while to ob&s;erve, that they who cen&s;ure the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="384" REF="386">
mo&s;t &s;everely, acknowledge its tendency to be moral in one re&s;pect. There is one virtue, &s;trict decency and temperance, which they own that we naturally derive from our em|ployment. They in&s;inuate, indeed, that it is the only one. But if it be evident, that this one virtue nece&s;&s;arily promotes other virtues, and gives us advantages for cultivating them, it cannot be denied that our calling, by its immediate influence on this one, will indi|rectly, but really tend to form the other parts of a virtuous temper.&mdash;Decency and tempe|rance implies at lea&s;t &s;trict ab&s;tinence from all the exce&s;&s;es of plea&s;ure, from the di&s;&s;ipation of gay and thoughtle&s;s mirth, and from all tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of any of our pa&s;&s;ions, which are unbecoming. In con&s;equence of this ab|&s;tinence, the &s;en&s;ual appetites and inferior pa&s;|&s;ions, which are always vicious when they be|come exce&s;&s;ive, and which in others are apt to become exce&s;&s;ive by being indulged without controul, will, almo&s;t unavoidably, be pre|&s;erved weak and moderate in a clergyman. This is one important ingredient in a virtuous character.&mdash;But this is not all. They who are di&s;po&s;ed to regard intemperance and levity with the mo&s;t favourable eye, can &s;carce deny that they often prove occa&s;ions of leading men into vices much more heinous. There is no crime &s;o atrocious, but a man brutified by ex|ce&s;s,
<PB N="385" REF="387">
or di&s;&s;ipated by giddine&s;s, may occa&s;ion|ally perpetrate. The ba&s;e&s;t cour&s;es have been taken, in order to procure gratification to pampered appetites. The frequent returns of levity and intemperance may produce repeated acts of any vice, and the&s;e repeated acts will, by degrees, render the wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions habi|tual. Our office, therefore, by confining us to &s;trict rules of decency, pre&s;erves us from a &s;ituation which would put us in imminent hazard of committing many acts of vice, and of contracting many evil habits. By this means, it has a peculiar tendency to produce a general purity of heart, which undoubtedly confers very con&s;iderable worth upon the cha|racter.&mdash;A &s;trict regard to decency will likewi&s;e influence our temper in another way. It implies a con&s;tant re&s;traint of vicious prin|ciples, concern that our conduct be right and unblameable, and regard to the authority and dictates of the moral faculty. Now there is a natural a&s;&s;ociation among our principles of action, by means of which any one of them prepares the mind for receiving any other that has the &s;ame direction. On this account, a regard to decency mu&s;t have a tendency to introduce into the &s;oul, ju&s;tice, veracity, hu|mility, meekne&s;s, patience, forbearance, and, in a word, all the virtues, which, like it&s;elf, hold of controul, and are included in the
<PB N="386" REF="388">
idea of &s;elf-government. The direct principle of all the&s;e is the &s;ame with that of decency, a &s;en&s;e of duty, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law of con|&s;cience. As every principle is &s;trengthened by being habitually exerted, the authority of con|&s;cience will be confirmed by our regard to de|cency; it will be enabled to controul every wrong affection with greater ea&s;e; and, by being accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmit to its government in one in&s;tance, we &s;hall be better di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it in all. Indeed men are often &s;ur|pri&s;ingly ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent in their con|duct; one pa&s;&s;ion may be perfectly ungoverned while another is re&s;trained. On this account we cannot affirm that a regard to decency will <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> produce all the virtues of &s;elf|government; but it certainly <HI>tends</HI> to have a favourable influence upon them; and our office, by almo&s;t <HI>certainly</HI> producing that, will <HI>probably</HI> promote the&s;e others.&mdash;The prin|cipal ob&s;truction to the prevalence of good af|fections ari&s;es from the &s;trength of &s;ome vici|ous pa&s;&s;ions, which oppo&s;e their exerci&s;e. A regard to decency, by contributing <HI>directly</HI> to weaken the&s;e vicious pa&s;&s;ions, will lay the mind open to the influence of worthy affections, and will thus give us great advantages for ac|quiring all tho&s;e amiable virtues which con|&s;i&s;t in the exerci&s;e of them.&mdash;If, therefore, &s;trict decency and temperance re&s;ult naturally
<PB N="387" REF="389">
from our profe&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t have, at lea&s;t, an indirect tendency to promote all other virtues. The conce&s;&s;ions of our adver&s;aries, however &s;mall they may appear, imply that our pro|fe&s;&s;ion has a real tendency to promote uni|ver&s;al virtue.</P>
<P>THESE general arguments, drawn from the real characters of the generality of clergymen, from the natural judgment of mankind, that virtue is peculiarly incumbent on them; and from the influence of that partial virtue which is allowed by all to re&s;ult naturally from our profe&s;&s;ion, appeared too important to be wholly omitted, becau&s;e they not only are conclu&s;ive in them&s;elves, but al&s;o throw con&s;iderable light on the whole of this &s;ubject.&mdash;But the mo&s;t direct proof of the tendency of our of|fice, to form us to a temper of univer&s;al vir|tue, &s;till remains. It ari&s;es from the nature of that office.</P>
<P>As moral cau&s;es have doubtle&s;s a very great influence on the characters of men, &s;o all profe&s;&s;ions, it is allowed, contain fixt moral principles which tend to produce a corre&s;pon|dent character, and have often force enough to alter the di&s;po&s;ition, that was received from nature. Now we may learn, with certainty, the tendency of the moral principles e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="388" REF="390">
to any profe&s;&s;ion, by examining the nature of that profe&s;&s;ion, its end, and the proper means of promoting that end. If we &s;urvey the mi|ni&s;terial office in this manner, we &s;hall find, that it has an e&s;&s;ential tendency to promote a virtuous temper.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel is, in brief, to teach religion. The tendency of his office will, therefore, be altogether deter|mined by the nature of the religion which he teaches. Chri&s;tianity includes all the princi|ples of natural religion, and &s;uperadds the re|velation of a &s;tupendous di&s;pen&s;ation of Pro|vidence, for the redemption and reformation of an apo&s;tate world, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The truths of natural theology, e&s;pecially as they are illu&s;trated and refined in &s;cripture, center in this, that to <HI>fear God, and keep his com|mandment, is the whole of man</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xii. 13.</NOTE>. The peculiar doctrines of revelation <HI>teach us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly, and godly</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 12.</NOTE>. Both are pro|po&s;ed in the &s;criptures, the only rule of our teaching, with an expre&s;s de&s;ign to form us to the love of God and of man, to make us <HI>perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tit. iii. 17.</NOTE>. Religious principles are con&s;tantly
<PB N="389" REF="391">
repre&s;ented as arguments for all virtue, and addre&s;&s;ed to our hopes, to our fears, to our gratitude, to our honour, to our propen&s;ity to imitation, to every affection of the human heart that can have any influence on conduct. At the &s;ame time, in the &s;criptures, all the parts of virtue, all the duties of life, are illu&s;|trated in the ju&s;te&s;t, and the mo&s;t practical maner. Our employment is, to promote the belief, and the practice of this religion; to re|commend goodne&s;s, by publi&s;hing truth; to explain virtue, and enforce it by all po&s;&s;ible motives. Can &s;uch employment tend to form us to any other temper, than that virtue which we inculcate upon others?</P>
<P>IT is certainly fir&s;t of all requi&s;ite in a teacher, that he under&s;tand the &s;ubject of his teaching, and that, for this purpo&s;e, he &s;tudy it with care. Our profe&s;&s;ion will, therefore, naturally lead us to the diligent and con&s;tant &s;tudy of all the doctrines and duties of reli|gion; it will urge us to <HI>know the holy &s;crip|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI>&punc; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15.</NOTE>, to <HI>meditate upon them,</HI> to <HI>give our&s;elves wholly to them</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 15.</NOTE>, that we may be <HI>able to teach others</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 2.</NOTE>. If, then, religious or moral con&s;i|derations, if precepts, or arguments, if maxims, of &s;entiments, examples, or rules of virtue
<PB N="390" REF="392">
have really <HI>any</HI> force, they mu&s;t exert it <HI>mo&s;t</HI> in purifying, refining, and exalting the tem|pers of tho&s;e who&s;e whole bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to attend to them. Since mini&s;ters mu&s;t often think on all the&s;e, that they may under&s;tand them, and that they may inculcate them upon others; the con&s;equence will be, that, if they are, like other men, &s;ubject to the law of ha|bit, incitements to virtue will occur to their thoughts more ea&s;ily and frequently, than to the thoughts of others, and urge them more powerfully to a &s;uitable behaviour.</P>
<P>A GREAT part of the vice with which other men are infected, ari&s;es from the temptations to which they are expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. Each of them has a temporal vocation, the direct end of which does not coincide with that of their &s;piritual calling, and which therefore &s;ometimes leads them off from the duties of the latter. But mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have no worldly bu&s;i|ne&s;s: the nature of their office, as well as the authority of &s;cripture, to which they are in|di&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to &s;ubmit, forbids them to <HI>entangle</HI> them&s;elves <HI>with the affairs of this life</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE>; and, by con&s;equence, pre&s;erves them, while they continue in their proper province, from

tho&s;e temptations which produce the greate&s;t part of the wickedne&s;s of the world. Our occupation is, to enforce a &s;en&s;e of virtue and religion upon others; and every attempt of this kind is an act of virtue, which tends directly to our own improvement.

<P>OUR office leads us to ob&s;erve our fellow|creatures in all tho&s;e &s;ituations, in which either virtuous principles, or the &s;en&s;e of vice, produce the mo&s;t con&s;picuous effects, and tend mo&s;t &s;trongly to alarm a &s;pectator, and to force him to attend to the oppo&s;ite natures of good and evil.

<P>To enumerate all the peculiar inducements which the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us have to pure and exalted virtue, were indeed to explain all the circum&s;tances of the pa&s;toral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. From the few ob&s;ervations which we have made already, it appears evident, that that office
<PB N="396" REF="398">
tends to promote virtue in tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, by many moral cau&s;es e&s;&s;ential to it, and fit to work on the mo&s;t univer&s;al and unque&s;ti|onable principles of human nature.</P>
<P>BUT though our office has plainly an e&s;&s;en|tial and unalterable tendency to purify and refine the heart, yet we will acknowledge,&mdash;we reckon our&s;elves nowi&s;e concerned to di&s;&s;em|ble it&mdash;it highly imports us to con&s;ider it very often,&mdash;that our profe&s;&s;ion will not form us infallibly to virtue; nay that, if we allow it to fail of producing this its primary and mo&s;t natural effect, the very circum&s;tances which give us &s;o many advantages for virtue, will render us more deeply and more ob&s;tinately wicked than the re&s;t of mankind.&mdash;By the original con&s;titution of our nature, habit, which &s;trengthens our <HI>active</HI> principles, weakens all <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> impre&s;&s;ions. The more frequently we con&s;ider or feel motives to vir|tue without being really excited to the prac|tice of virtue, the feebler will be their influence upon us, the greater our in&s;en&s;ibility, the more imminent our danger of never yielding to their force. This is an alarming truth to all human creatures, but to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel more alarming than to others. We mu&s;t revolve and preach the truths and duties of religion &s;o frequently, that if they do not
<PB N="397" REF="399">
influence us early to &s;incere and &s;tedfa&s;t vir|tue, they mu&s;t quickly become familiar and lo&s;e their power. Moral and divine con&s;ider|ations mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;o continually through our minds, that in a very &s;hort time they will make no impre&s;&s;ion on us. A per&s;on whom our profe&s;&s;ion does not render virtuous, will become more &s;uddenly and more de&s;perately obdurate in wickedne&s;s, than any other man. Nothing contributes more to &s;trengthen any principle, than an oppo&s;ition which doth not effectually re&s;train it. Our profe&s;&s;ion con|tains the mo&s;t powerful inducements to vir|tue; the&s;e will, at lea&s;t, make a vigorous <HI>oppo|&s;ition</HI> to all vicious principles of action; but if the oppo&s;ition do not &s;ubdue them, they will collect all their force in order to &s;urmount it, and they will be &s;trengthened and confirmed by the violent effort. As a &s;luice which can|not &s;tem a torrent altogether, only renders the inundation greater, and greater &s;till the longer it keeps it back; ju&s;t &s;o vicious pa&s;|&s;ions which are too violent to be wholly re|&s;trained by the fences that our profe&s;&s;ion rai&s;es again&s;t them, will produce the mo&s;t dreadful deluge of wickedne&s;s, whenever their fury can break down the&s;e fences. If a pa&s;tor be really vicious, he will, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, be &s;ingularly vicious. Nothing le&s;s than a total
<PB N="398" REF="400">
depravation of &s;oul can be the effect of a man's re&s;i&s;ting the &s;trict obligations to virtue, and abu&s;ing the &s;ignal advantages for cultivating it, which the pa&s;toral office affords.&mdash;In the&s;e, and, perhaps, in &s;ome other ways, our office may heighten vice in tho&s;e who refu&s;e to be actuated by its genuine &s;pirit. But this con|ce&s;&s;ion will avail our antagoni&s;ts nothing. Were this a &s;ufficient proof, that our office tends naturally to vice, it would likewi&s;e be a proof, that all con&s;ideration of our duty, or of arguments for the practice of it, has a na|tural tendency to render us vicious; for it is certain that the oftener any man reflects on his duty, and the &s;tronger his &s;en&s;e of its ob|ligation is, if he be not really excited to the practice of it, the le&s;s chance there is of his ever practi&s;ing it, the more hardened in vice he will become in time, and the more impe|tuou&s;ly ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions will rage within him.</P>
<P>BOTH from the former arguments, and from the &s;urvey that we have taken of the na|ture of our office, it is plain, that it tends pri|marily and mo&s;t naturally to virtue. It pro|motes not one virtue, but a temper which di&s;|po&s;es the mind to the culture of every virtue. It is the abu&s;e of it that leads to vice; and the abu&s;e leads &s;o &s;trongly to vice, only be|cau&s;e

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now enquire, THIRDLY, how far our office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame tho&s;e particular vices which &s;ome have repre&s;ented as characteri&s;tical of our order.</P>
<P>THIS is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the late Author to whom we have referred, has unwa|rily admitted &s;ome fallacious principles and wrong &s;uppo&s;itions, into the rea&s;oning by which he &s;upports the charge. The&s;e render his ar|guments &s;pecious, and make tho&s;e inducements to vice appear to ari&s;e from the original and prevailing &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion, which are really but the partial effects of &s;ome of its circum&s;tances, or accidental temptations ari&s;|ing from the abu&s;e of it. And becau&s;e the&s;e fallacies run through all the parts of his rea|&s;oning, it will be proper, before we examine the particular vices which he derives from the genius of our calling, to make a few ob&s;erva|tions on the general method, in which he traces out the tendency of that calling.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="403">IF we &s;hould allow that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a true account of the tendency of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in our profe&s;&s;ion, which he mentions, yet we might in&s;i&s;t with rea&s;on, that he has applied the character, which re&s;ults from them, by far too generally. He ju&s;tly blames the undi|&s;tingui&s;hed judgments of the vulgar, who comprehend every individual of a nation, without exception, in the &s;ame national charac|ter. He ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that all that can be a&s;&s;erted with truth is, that &s;ome particular qua|lities will be more frequently met with among &s;ome cla&s;&s;es of people than others. Has he pre&s;erved this nece&s;&s;ary caution and delicacy in determining the character of the clergy? He in|deed &s;ays, there are exceptions. I will not enquire, how far he can &s;eriou&s;ly admit ex|ceptions, with re&s;pect to &s;ome particulars, con&s;i&s;tently with the manner in which his rea|&s;oning is pur&s;ued. But certainly it was wrong to combine all the vices which he mentions, into one character, and to a&s;cribe it to mo&s;t individuals of our order. The &s;ame temptation will not prevail with all; but only with tho&s;e to who&s;e con&s;titution it is adapted. Every day's experience proves, that that may be an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to one man, which makes no impre&s;&s;ion on another. Though, therefore, the genius of our calling were &s;uch as it is de|&s;cribed, it could only be inferred, that &s;ome of
<PB N="402" REF="404">
the vices which are enumerated, will belong to one clergyman, others to another, but not that all the&s;e vices will be united in the temper of any con&s;iderable number. The circum&s;tances which operate on the character are &s;o various, and on that account the influence of each of them is &s;o precarious, and the turn of mind from which each derives its force is &s;o uncer|tain, that we ought to rea&s;on on this &s;ubject with a peculiar degree of diffidence.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;elect a few circum&s;tances, in any profe&s;&s;ion, which, con&s;idered by them|&s;elves, may appear to have an immoral ten|dency; but we cannot thence infer that the profe&s;&s;ion hath an immoral tendency upon the whole; for the influence of the&s;e may be over|balanced by other circum&s;tances equally e&s;&s;en|tial to it. Were we to e&s;timate the charac|ter which any profe&s;&s;ion forms, by the &s;eparate view of &s;ome circum&s;tances belonging to it, we might repre&s;ent it in a very unfavourable light. The character of a &s;oldier is reckoned &s;o ami|able by this author, that he judges it the fitte&s;t to be oppo&s;ed to ours, in order to &s;et off its deformity. But it is a &s;oldier's bu&s;ine&s;s to fight and kill, at the command of his &s;uperiors, without examining the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e.&mdash;Were it fair to attend to this circum&s;tance alone, we might &s;ay that his employment ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="403" REF="405">
renders him cruel, arbitrary, a con|temner of right, and an ab&s;olute pe&s;t in &s;ociety. Such preci&s;ely is the rea&s;oning by which this author would prove, that our office nece&s;&s;arily inflames many of the blacke&s;t vices of human nature. He has, by &s;ome over&s;ight, omitted many circum&s;tances e&s;&s;ential to it, which have the mo&s;t powerful influence on virtue; he has fixed on a few circum&s;tances, &s;ome of them really foreign to our office, and others of them but ca&s;ually and remotely connected with it; he has con&s;idered the effects, which the&s;e would produce, if they con&s;tituted the whole of our office; and I will venture to &s;ay, he has exag|gerated both the&s;e effects, and the cau&s;es, from which they are repre&s;ented as proceeding. In this re&s;pect his rea&s;oning is fallacious, being built on an in&s;ufficient foundation.</P>
<P>WHEN it appears that any circum&s;tance in a profe&s;&s;ion, viewed in one light, tends to vice, we cannot always conclude, that even this cir|cum&s;tance tends to vice upon the whole; be|cau&s;e it may as naturally, or more naturally, produce other effects of an oppo&s;ite kind. It is the office of a judge to pronounce &s;entence exactly according to law, without regard to the ties of relation, to compa&s;&s;ion, or to worthi|ne&s;s of character. By con&s;idering this circum|&s;tance in one point of view, we might be
<PB N="404" REF="406">
inclined to think, that this office naturally ba|ni&s;hes from the heart, pity, genero&s;ity, friend|&s;hip, the love of relations, and all the amiable offspring of benevolence. But this will not be its natural effect; for this unbia&s;&s;ed regard to right, in oppo&s;ition to all inducements from affection, is fit to cheri&s;h an attachment to public happine&s;s, for promoting which all the rules of ju&s;tice are calculated; and, by giving con&s;tant exerci&s;e to the &s;en&s;e of virtue, it &s;trengthens this &s;en&s;e, and enables it to con|troul all vicious di&s;po&s;itions, and to lay the mind open, by this means, to the operation of every generous, and kind, and worthy affec|tion. But this author has con&s;idered tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, of which he takes notice, only in one point of view; he has ob|&s;erved only &s;ome of their con&s;equences on the character, but has unluckily overlooked others, more e&s;&s;ential and important, and of a per|fectly contrary nature. If this be true, his arguments will be inconclu&s;ive, and that may be but a very <HI>partial</HI> tendency, which they would repre&s;ent as the prevailing &s;pirit of our office.</P>
<P>THIS author begins his character of our profe&s;&s;ion, by adopting a trite maxim, which, he &s;ays, is not altogether fal&s;e, that <HI>prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame.</HI> I think, it may be
<PB N="405" REF="407">
ea&s;ily proved, that this maxim cannot be true. It nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that the way of life and the occupation of prie&s;ts of all religions is per|fectly the &s;ame. Different cau&s;es can produce the &s;ame or &s;imilar effects, only by means of tho&s;e qualities which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common. Every circum&s;tance in an occupation has &s;ome influence upon the character. Charac|ters, therefore, perfectly uniform, cannot be the re&s;ult of occupations which do not coin|cide in all re&s;pects. Politene&s;s and the good qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ties related to it, make up the character which this author derives from the profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>modern</HI> &s;oldier. He quotes a &s;aying of an antient writer who was perfectly well ac|quainted with life and manners, that <HI>it is not in the power even of the gods to make a polite &s;ol|dier.</HI> Yet the way of life of an <HI>ancient</HI> &s;oldier included almo&s;t all the circum&s;tances from which he derives the politene&s;s of a <HI>modern</HI> &s;ol|dier. The very &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, therefore, may produce perfectly contrary characters, in different periods, by means of a difference in the prevailing manners of the world. It is &s;trange, that an author of uncommon pene|tration, who had remarked in this in&s;tance, that a &s;mall change, in the cu&s;toms of common life, could even rever&s;e the &s;pirit of one pro|fe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould immediately after produce a maxim, which &s;uppo&s;es that the greate&s;t change
<PB N="406" REF="408">
in religious principles and cu&s;toms, cannot make any alteration in the character of prie&s;ts.&mdash;Prie&s;ts, being the mini&s;ters of religion, mu&s;t derive, from their office, a character corre|&s;pondent to the nature of that religion, in which they mini&s;ter. But &s;urely the nature of <HI>all</HI> religions is not perfectly the &s;ame. This author acknowledges in another place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion, p. 2, 25, 34.</NOTE>, that no two nations, and &s;carce any two men, have agreed preci&s;ely in the &s;ame religious &s;enti|ments; that polythei&s;m of every kind is, mo&s;t properly, a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious athei&s;m, &s;imilar to a belief of elves and fairies, which it is great complai&s;ance to dignify with the name of reli|gion. The pagan religion con&s;i&s;ted wholly of groundle&s;s fables, incon&s;i&s;tent traditions, im|moral tales, in&s;ignificant ceremonies, and empty pageantry <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 69.</NOTE>. Could it then have the &s;ame tendency with Chri&s;tianity, which delivers the genuine principles of thei&s;m, which in&s;titutes very few ceremonial duties, which every where repre&s;ents the&s;e as &s;ub&s;ervient to moral virtue, which proclaims, that the alone <HI>weighty matters of the law are ju&s;tice, mercy, fidelity, and the love of God</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii. 23. Luke, xi. 42.</NOTE>, which &s;ets before men the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious examples of every virtue, and the &s;tronge&s;t motives to the practice of it? Can a
<PB N="407" REF="409">
pagan prie&s;t, wholly employed in the ab&s;urd rites of the former, derive <HI>from his office</HI> the &s;ame character to which a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter will be naturally formed, by teaching the doc|trines, and inculcating the duties of the latter? What one principle almo&s;t is common to their functions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT is plain from the mo&s;t &s;uperficial view of the character which Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> draws for Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, that he avails him&s;elf of all the corruptions of character ari&s;ing from the ab&s;urdities of <HI>Popery</HI> for blackening the clergy in general. I was unwilling, however, to &s;uppo&s;e that he de&s;igned to repre|&s;ent the character of Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, derived from their office as the &s;ame with that character which <HI>Heathen</HI> prie&s;ts would receive from their functions. I took it for granted, that this learned author was too well acquainted with antiquity, not to know that the Pagan prie&s;thood was e&s;tabli&s;hed on a very different footing from the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and that the di&s;|tinction between <HI>clergy</HI> and <HI>laity</HI> was never heard of in the Heathen world. Candour induced me to believe that a per&s;on who mu&s;t know the purity and excellence of the religion and morality taught in the Scriptures, though he may not reckon it of divine original, could never entertain a thought of &s;etting it on a level with Pagan &s;uper&s;tition. I was di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in his writings, which &s;eemed to imply this, to an exce&s;s of zeal again&s;t tho&s;e corruptions of true religion, which the folly and wickedne&s;s of men have too often introduced. I therefore intended the ob&s;ervations, which have been made above, concerning the difference between Pagani&s;m and Chri&s;|tianity, only for illu&s;trating the general principle, that the na|ture of <HI>all</HI> religions is not perfectly the &s;ame, and that, by con|&s;equence, all religions cannot form preci&s;ely the &s;ame character in prie&s;ts; a principle, which I immediately applied to prove the difference between the natural character of a Popi&s;h prie&s;t, and that of a Prote&s;tant Clergyman. But in a later edition of his <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> which did not fall in my way till after the fir&s;t publi|cation of the Sermon, this author is &s;olicitous to put it beyond doubt that he regards the Heathen prie&s;thood and the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try as preci&s;ely the &s;ame office; from which it will be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that Pagani&s;m and Chri&s;tianity are, in his opinion, the very &s;ame religion. He makes this addition to his character of the clergy. <Q>'Twas no bad expedient in the ROMANS, for preventing the &s;trong effect of the prie&s;tly character, to make it a law that no one &s;hould be received into the Sacerdotal office, till he was pa&s;t fifty years of age. DION. <HI>Hal.</HI> lib. 1. The living a layman till that age, 'tis pre&s;umed, would be able to fix the character.</Q> Any per&s;on, who reads this paragraph, would certainly think that <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> has a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>Romulus</HI> fixed the age of prie&s;ts to fifty, <HI>as an expedient for preventing the &s;trong effect of the</HI> &s;ame <HI>prie&s;tly cha|racter,</HI> which is delineated by Mr. <HI>Hume.</HI> But in truth, that hi&s;torian does by no means repre&s;ent the law of <HI>Romulus</HI> as an expedient for this purpo&s;e. He &s;ays, <Q>While others generally cho&s;e the officers of religion in an improper manner, &s;ome &s;elling the dignity, and &s;ome di&s;po&s;ing of it by lot; he would not allow the prie&s;tly office either to be &s;old, or to be given by lot: on the contrary, he made a law, that out of every ward two &s;hould be cho&s;en into the prie&s;thood, above fifty years of age, who excelled the re&s;t in virtue and nobility, who had a plentiful fortune, and were free from every bodily defect.</Q> DION. <HI>Hal. Ant. Rom.</HI> lib. 2. Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s ac|count of the intention of this law mu&s;t, therefore, &s;tand wholly on his own authority. But to what does that authority amount in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? When it is fir&s;t proved that a prince who, according to the account given of him by <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> be|&s;towed his fir&s;t care on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the religion with which he was acquainted, who reckoned a regard to it the prin|cipal means of &s;ecuring the pro&s;perity of the nation, and who made larger provi&s;ion for the prie&s;thood, than the founders of any other &s;tates, yet believed that religion has an unfavourable influence on good morals: when it is proved that he fore&s;aw that the prie&s;tly office tended nece&s;&s;arily to corrupt the character, and contrived this law on purpo&s;e to counteract this tendency, and to render the unavoidable corruption as <HI>little</HI> as po&s;&s;ible; then Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s account of the &s;pirit of this law may be admitted as ingenious. But till all this be proved, it is a conjecture not only de&s;titute of all plau&s;ibility, but even perfectly impro|bable.&mdash;A great degree of ingenuity, mi&s;guided by partiality to a favourite notion, has cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> to overlook the <HI>obvious</HI> rea&s;on of the <HI>Roman</HI> law. The religion of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> was a political in&s;titution, and was con&s;tantly rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of the leading men. The prie&s;thood was an high dignity in the &s;tate, to which only patricians were admitted for a long time after the foundation of the city. A certain age was fixed for every magi&s;tracy; and the age of fifty was, in like manner, fixed for the prie&s;thood, that it might be be&s;towed only on per|&s;ons, who had &s;erved their country, and acquired authority in it. When the law in que&s;tion is con&s;idereo in this natural and obvious point of view, let any per&s;on determine, whether it can, in the lea&s;t degree, confirm Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s argument, or has the remote&s;t connection with his &s;ubject.</NOTE>? The Prote&s;tant religion is very
<PB N="408" REF="410">
different from Popery, both in its form, and in its &s;pirit. The office of a Popi&s;h prie&s;t is, in
<PB N="409" REF="411">
con&s;equence of this, very different from that of a Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter. The one is conti|nually recommending imignificant ceremonies, as a compen&s;ation for real goodne&s;s; the other is perpetually inculcating, that nothing can compen&s;ate the want of it. Can the&s;e employ|ments promote the very &s;ame turn of charac|ter? It can &s;carce be &s;aid, that prie&s;ts of the&s;e two religions agree in the acknowledgment of the Scriptures; for in popery the Scriptures are made void by legends and traditions. But if they agree in this, the only part of their
<PB N="410" REF="412">
character, which they can, on this account, derive in common from their office, is either that which re&s;ults from the general tendency of revelation, the love of God and man, or tho&s;e virtues which are recommended particu|larly to the mini&s;ters of religion. And what are the&s;e? The Scripture commands them to be <HI>apt to teach, blamele&s;s, holy, godly, vigi|lant, &s;ober, temperate, not given to wine, mode&s;t, of good behaviour, ju&s;t, not covetous, not &s;trikers, not brawlers, not &s;elf-willed, not &s;oon angry, pa|tient, forbearing, gentle, meek, peaceable, bene|volent, given to ho&s;pitality, lovers of good men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 2, 3. 2 Tim. ii. 22, 24. Tit. i. 7, 8.</NOTE>. May the&s;e ever be the qualities in which prie&s;ts of all religions agree! But then their charac|ter will be, in every re&s;pect, the rever&s;e of what this author has drawn for them.&mdash;In a word, becau&s;e different religions are unlike in many circum&s;tances fit to operate on the charac|ter, prie&s;ts of all religions cannot be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IT is not very ea&s;y to determine with cer|tainty, what place the fal&s;e maxim, which we have mentioned, really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in this author's rea&s;oning; whether it be one of the principles, which he u&s;es in a&s;certaining the tendency of
<PB N="411" REF="413">

<P>IF it be a principle on which the rea&s;oning proceeds, it ought to have been clearly proved before it was adopted; for, if it be really fal&s;e or doubtful, every argument built upon it is de&s;titute of evidence, however plau&s;ible it may appear to tho&s;e who take the principle for granted. If it be con&s;idered in this light, there is but one argument produced for prov|ing it. <Q>Prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame, for as chymi&s;ts ob&s;erve, that &s;pirits, when rai&s;ed to a certain height, are all the &s;ame, from whatever materials they be extracted; &s;o the&s;e men, being elevated above huma|nity, acquire an uniform character, which is entirely their own.</Q> Do you think that this compari&s;on be&s;tows any evidence upon the maxim? Is the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits, by a chemical proce&s;s, a ca&s;e exactly &s;imilar to the forming of a character, by means of religious and moral principles? And is it not &s;ome|what &s;trange, to &s;uppo&s;e all prie&s;ts elevated above humanity, as a &s;tep towards proving, that they are all &s;unk into vices which depre&s;s humanity below it&s;elf?

<P>BUT if the author really de&s;igned to infer, from the nature of our office, that prie&s;ts of all religions agree in the character which he de&s;cribes, he ought not to &s;uppo&s;e this con|clu&s;ion in determining the nature of that of|fice. This is plainly rea&s;oning in a circle. Yet many of his arguments re&s;t on this &s;uppo|&s;ition, and will be inconclu&s;ive without it. Could this manner of rea&s;oning be allowed, it is obvious that great advantage might be de|rived from it. By means of it all the ba&s;e&s;t corruptions of religion come to be regarded as

<P>BUT if we would examine fairly and im|partially, what is the tendency of the pa&s;toral office, with re&s;pect to any virtue or vice, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>office</HI> it&s;elf from the <HI>abu&s;es</HI> of it. In order to this, we mu&s;t take our ac|count of it only from the Scriptures; we mu&s;t con&s;ider the end for which they declare that it was appointed, the employment on which they put Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters for promoting that end, and the rules which they pre&s;cribe con|cerning the manner of executing their employ|ment. An infidel cannot ju&s;tly proceed in any other way; for whether the Scriptures have any real authority or not, it is only in them that the in&s;titution of this office, or the man|ner of executing it, is &s;aid to be contained.

really is; and then he mu&s;t con&s;ider all the circum&s;tances of it together, trace out all the natural effects of each, balance the good and the bad effects of the &s;ame circum&s;tance, and weigh the tendencies of different circum|&s;tances again&s;t one another, before he can ex|pect to determine its genuine &s;pirit. This will be, indeed, a difficult and complex induc|tion; but philo&s;ophers know well, that an in|duction equally &s;evere is requi&s;ite, before a cer|tain conclu&s;ion can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;ubjects of a le&s;s intricate nature than the formation of human characters. Whether the author who&s;e arguments we are examining, has ob|&s;erved this method; whether, in e&s;timating our character, he has not, on the contrary, fixed on &s;ome circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, con&s;idered even the&s;e but in one light, pointed out only &s;ome of their effects upon the charac|ter, unduly exaggerated particulars, and argued from circum&s;tances foreign to the office of a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, nay wholly contradictory to it; I will appeal to the impartial; I will appeal to his own candour, after he has re|viewed his arguments, by the acknowledged rules of rea&s;oning. It will appear, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from the following examination of tho&s;e vices which our office is &s;aid to have a fixt and unalterable tendency to promote&punc;&mdash;They are <HI>hypocri&s;y, &s;uper&s;tition, ambition, vanity,</HI>

<P>DO tho&s;e abominable vices, which have been mentioned, indeed compo&s;e the genuine character of the mini&s;ters of Je&s;us? Are the&s;e the natural re&s;ult of their profe&s;&s;ion?

<P>THERE are two circum&s;tances in our profe&s;&s;ion, which, it is &s;aid, nece&s;&s;arily form us to <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI>&mdash;One is the obligation which it lays us under to ob&s;erve &s;trict decency.&mdash;Decency con&s;i&s;ts in ab&s;taining from all beha|viour that is either vicious or offen&s;ive. The mo&s;t natural principle of this ab&s;tinence is vir|tue; and our office obliges us to decency, only by obliging us to blamele&s;s virtue. Did it exert its full influence upon our character, we
<PB N="417" REF="419">
&s;hould not &s;tand in need of di&s;&s;imulation, in order to appear virtuous. Indeed, it cannot be expected, in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, that this office will exert its full influence univer|&s;ally, or produce that exalted virtue which it demands, in all who exerci&s;e it. On this ac|count many mini&s;ters may have an inducement, from their profe&s;&s;ion, to endeavour in particu|lar in&s;tances, to conceal vices and imperfec|tions which really belong to them. Yet &s;till this is but a &s;econdary tendency, by which the profe&s;&s;ion cannot be fairly characterized; a tendency too, which reflects honour upon it, becau&s;e it proceeds only from the &s;trength of its original tendency to virtue.&mdash;And is that conduct which even this &s;econdary tendency produces, ab&s;olutely blameable? Can it be allowed, that all re&s;erve is criminal hypocri&s;y? Is every man obliged in hone&s;ty to di&s;cover to others all the faults of which he is con&s;cious in him&s;elf? Is it not <HI>right</HI> to conceal our vices from the knowledge of others, by all lawful means? Will it not in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent the infection of our bad example? Certainly it is not criminal for a per&s;on to endeavour to reform him&s;elf from any vice which he has contracted. Yet this can be done, only by &s;etting a guard over his words and actions, and ab&s;taining from giving &s;cope to tho&s;e wrong pa&s;&s;ions which continue to

&s;olicit him very powerfully. May not a mi|ni&s;ter ab&s;tain from the practice of vices to which he is di&s;po&s;ed, from a &s;en&s;e of duty, or from a de&s;ire to extirpate them by degrees; or may not he ab&s;tain from things which he knows to be lawful, in charitable indulgence to the weakne&s;s of others, or from a regard to character, without any fault, without being liable to the charge of hypocri&s;y, without in|curring any danger of de&s;troying the candour and ingenuity of his temper, or making an ir|reparable breach in his character? Is not the conduct rather laudable?&mdash;Indeed, if a clergyman be ob&s;tinately wicked, he will be expo&s;ed to a temptation, from his office, to <HI>blameable</HI> hypocri&s;y. In every profe&s;&s;ion, the vicious are often induced to affect an ap|pearance of virtue, in order to promote their de&s;igns. The pa&s;toral office will not render every individual really virtuous. But it can|not be executed by a per&s;on who is known to be vicious. It is, therefore, probable that a vicious mini&s;ter will put on a fal&s;e &s;hew of goodne&s;s. But &s;hall the whole order be, for this rea&s;on, charged with affecting a conti|nued grimace, in order to &s;upport the vene|ration of the ignorant vulgar, and promote the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition? Ab&s;urd <HI>corruptions</HI> of religion there have been, which were intended for promoting a &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
<PB N="419" REF="421">
and which could not be &s;upported without an implicit veneration of the prie&s;t: but to argue from the&s;e, is to confound the vile&s;t perver&s;ions of religion with Chri&s;tianity, the ba&s;e&s;t pro&s;titutions of the pa&s;toral of|fice with the office it&s;elf. Where do the Scriptures enjoin a clergyman to promote a &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit? The clergyman who aims at it, pur&s;ues a wrong end, &s;ugge&s;ted to him by his corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, not by his of|fice, to which it is altogether foreign; and the &s;ame corrupt pa&s;&s;ions lead him to pervert his office, that it may become &s;ub&s;ervient to this end. For what part of the pa&s;toral func|tion is the blind veneration of the ignorant vulgar requi&s;ite? Indeed, we cannot execute our office, without being careful to de&s;erve e&s;teem; virtue alone de&s;erves it; our of|fice, therefore, prompts us &s;trongly to virtue. If any of us attempt to &s;upply the want of virtue, by affected grimace, in order to pro|cure e&s;teem, he u&s;es unlawful means of ac|compli&s;hing a lawful end; he is guilty of ba&s;e hypocri&s;y, the temptation to which ari&s;es in|deed from his office, but ari&s;es &s;olely from its rendering virtue nece&s;&s;ary for the execu|tion of it. If any of us weakly mi&s;take gri|mace for the genuine dignity of virtue, he confounds a vice with a good quality, to which it bears &s;ome general re&s;emblance.&mdash;
<PB N="420" REF="422">
But how does the mini&s;terial office contri|bute to the mi&s;take? Do any of the duties of that office, de&s;cribed in Scripture, or does the example of our Saviour, who <HI>came cating and drinking</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 19.</NOTE>, or the example of his Apo&s;tles, lead into it? It ari&s;es only from the weakne&s;s of men, which produces &s;imilar in&s;tances of &s;elf-deceit in all profe&s;&s;ions.&mdash;We may add, that our danger of being &s;educed into hypo|critical grimace cannot ju&s;tly make the cha|racter of our order appear in a di&s;advanta|geous light, when it is compared with the character of other ranks of men. The weak|ne&s;s of our nature may render that corrup|tion of religion and of our office, from which the temptation to hypocri&s;y ari&s;es, very fre|quent; but the &s;ame cau&s;e will as frequently introduce di&s;hone&s;t views, and di&s;hone&s;t ar|tifices, of different kinds, into other profe&s;|&s;ions. When the pa&s;toral office is actually perverted from its real end, to promote the purpo&s;es of a corrupt religion, the temptation to hypocri&s;y may be very &s;trong, &s;o as ac|tually to prevail with many of our order; but the perver&s;ions of other profe&s;&s;ions af|ford temptations, to tho&s;e &s;pecies of di&s;|hone&s;ty and craft which &s;uit them, as ir|re&s;i&s;tible and as univer&s;ally prevalent. The
<PB N="421" REF="423">
hypocri&s;y which ari&s;es from our compli|ance with the&s;e temptations, is highly blame|able and pernicious, but is not generally ba&s;er or more de&s;tructive than the various frauds and artifices, which are practi&s;ed by bad men in other callings.&mdash;On the whole, our office leads primarily to real virtue, not to an affected appearance of it; it very naturally produces a grave and &s;erious temper, and a cautious attention to our deportment, which may be di&s;agreeable to the gay and di&s;&s;i|pated, and which they may uncharitably charge with hypocri&s;y, becau&s;e of its con|trariety to their own manners, but which is totally di&s;tinct from vicious grimace: cor|ruptions of religion may pervert our of|fice &s;o far as to lead us to pur&s;ue ends, which cannot be accompli&s;hed without af|fected grimace; but the temptation to it is to be imputed, not to our office, or to re|ligion, but to the corruption of both, and to the weakne&s;s and fault of individuals; and whatever degree of grimace may really prevail among the clergy, it cannot ju&s;tly ex|po&s;e them to peculiar di&s;approbation, becau&s;e many kinds of di&s;hone&s;t art, as odious to the full as this, are equally general among other ranks of men.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="424">IT is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that our office pro|motes hypocri&s;y by leading us to be em|ployed in the exerci&s;es of religion oftener than we can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the real &s;pirit of devotion.&mdash;It leads us, indeed, to be frequently employed in the exerci&s;es of reli|gion. The natural tendency of this is, to improve a temper of piety in our &s;ouls; for every habit is formed and &s;trengthened by frequent exerci&s;e. Mini&s;ters will &s;ometimes find their devotion languid, when they are called to exerci&s;e it. But the more con&s;tantly an affection is exerted, the &s;tronger and more habitual it is rendered by this means, the le&s;s will a per&s;on be indi&s;po&s;ed for exerting it. If, therefore, our office leads us to be more con&s;tant in the exerci&s;es of devotion than other men, it will nece&s;&s;arily render us le&s;s &s;ubject than others to fits of languor. They who have not originally a higher or more con&s;tant &s;pirit of devotion than the generality of mankind, will naturally acquire it by being engaged in our profe&s;&s;ion. It can|not be denied that our employment has an e&s;|&s;ential and &s;trong tendency to form us to emi|nent and con&s;tant piety, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and the mo&s;t excellent of all virtues, without ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ing, either that frequent acts of any virtue have no tendency to promote a habit of that virtue, or that the &s;trength
<PB N="423" REF="425">
of a habit has no tendency to lead us to act frequently upon it.&mdash;But it is &s;aid, that our office obliges us to affect devotion often, when we are already jaded with the exerci&s;es of it, or when our minds are engaged in worldly occupations. Suppo&s;e that it &s;ome|times called us to devotion, when we are in this &s;ituation. Is it nece&s;&s;arily unlawful to at|tempt to exert a good affection, when a per|&s;on is ill-di&s;po&s;ed to it? If the attempt pro|ceed from a &s;en&s;e of duty, it is &s;urely virtuous. And it is remarked by philo&s;ophers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon de Aug. Scient. lib. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE>, that one of the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;ons for exerting a principle &s;o as to improve it, is when we are wor&s;t di&s;po&s;ed. Then a &s;trong effort will be nece&s;&s;ary to overcome the oppo&s;ition ari&s;ing from our reluctance; and by this effort the principle will acquire greater &s;trength, than if it had been exerci&s;ed more ea&s;ily <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume's Di&s;&s;ert. on the Pa&s;&s;ions, page 176.</NOTE>. When other men find them&s;elves indi&s;po&s;ed for devo|tion, they may be tempted to neglect it; by neglecting it they will become more indi&s;|po&s;ed, and are thus in danger of becoming, by degrees, habitually impious; but a clergy|man, being under a nece&s;&s;ity, from his of|fice, to exerci&s;e it, is led, by this means, to take one of the fitte&s;t opportunities for cul|tivating
<PB N="424" REF="426">
a temper of real piety.&mdash;As our affections ari&s;e directly from ju&s;t conceptions of their objects, we can &s;eldom be &s;o aver&s;e from the exerci&s;e of any affection, that it cannot be produced by due attention to its object. Our office leads us to frequent medi|tation on that God who is the object of devo|tion, and on all tho&s;e &s;ubjects which can render our &s;entiments of his perfections vigo|rous and lively. It thus affords us the proper and direct means of rou&s;ing pious affections, when they are languid. And &s;ince our of|fice thus fixes us in contemplation of God, and obliges us frequently to exerci&s;e devout affections towards him, we mu&s;t be gro&s;sly faulty, if we be, at any time, &s;o ill-di&s;po&s;ed, as to approach him with feigned devotion. By the&s;e advantages which our profe&s;&s;ion gives us, piety may be rendered &s;o habitually predominant in our temper, that it &s;hall ea|gerly &s;eize every opportunity of acting, and that we &s;hall be able to exerci&s;e &s;incere devo|tion, in circum&s;tances in which they who are &s;eldom employed in religious duties, judging of us by them&s;elves, may think it impo&s;&s;ible, and cen&s;ure our wor&s;hip as hypocritical.&mdash;But is there no danger that we may be con|tented with going the round of religious ex|erci&s;es, without being at pains to excite the inward affections which ought to animate
<PB N="425" REF="427">
them? And if we &s;hould, will not this pro|duce hypocri&s;y? Undoubtedly. Mere formal wor&s;hip, frequently gone about, tends to make us think that we are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e inward affections from which our wor&s;hip &s;hould have proceeded, and thus prevents our &s;etting our&s;elves to cultivate them, and confirms us in hypocri&s;y. This danger ari&s;es from the very con&s;titution of human nature, and extends to all external ac|tions, which may &s;ometimes proceed from other principles than the virtue to which they corre&s;pond, and will, in that ca&s;e, di&s;gui&s;e our want of that virtue from us. If mini&s;ters, not|with&s;tanding the peculiar advantages which their profe&s;&s;ion gives them for cultivating a temper of real piety, engage in devotion without exciting that temper into act, they will be in greater danger than others, of be|coming in&s;en&s;ible of their want of piety, and will more quickly contract a &s;trong habit of hypocri&s;y, by rea&s;on of their frequent calls to devotion. But is this habit really wor&s;e, than a want of all appearance of religion, which the&s;e men would have infallibly run into, from the &s;ame degeneracy of mind, in any profe&s;|&s;ion which did not give them frequent calls to devotion? Or though it were, can our profe&s;&s;ion be ju&s;tly blamed for requiring tho&s;e acts of devotion, from the wrong performance
<PB N="426" REF="428">
of which that habit &s;prings? If it could, it mu&s;t follow, that <HI>all</HI> exerci&s;e of devotion is not only u&s;ele&s;s but highly dangerous. Nay, on this principle, all good external actions mu&s;t be cen&s;ured, as tending to corrupt the character, becau&s;e they may be performed when they do not proceed from their natural principle; and becau&s;e, when they are thus performed, they will rather ob&s;truct, than promote the improvement of that principle.&mdash;But, after all, a clergyman can really be in no <HI>peculiar</HI> danger from the <HI>public</HI> exerci&s;es of re|ligion, becau&s;e in them all the people profe&s;s to join; and yet they alone appear to be in|tended by this Author. He &s;eems to have had tho&s;e prie&s;ts in his eye, who are almo&s;t con|&s;tantly employed in running over forms of devotion, in a language which the people do not under&s;tand. But is it fair to draw an ar|gument from them, to clergymen, who, by their office, only pre&s;ide in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of devotion in which all the people are as much concerned as they? He &s;eems likewi&s;e to con|found mechanical warmth and exta&s;y, which mu&s;t needs be tran&s;ient, with calm and ratio|nal piety, which may actuate the mind as ha|bitually, and uninterruptedly, and be as much in readine&s;s to exert it&s;elf, whenever an occa&s;ion offers, as gratitude, friend&s;hip, or any other affection of the human heart.&mdash;In a word,
<PB N="427" REF="429">
our profe&s;&s;ion is &s;ingularly fit to form us to &s;incere and exalted piety, by obliging us to frequency in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of devotion, by the right performance of which alone a tem|per of piety can be formed, and by giving us great advantages for performing them aright; we may indeed perform them in a wrong manner, it may require &s;trict attention to avoid it; if we do not be&s;tow this attention, we may become hypocritical in our devotions; but the fault will be chargeable, not on our of|fice, but on our&s;elves, who have re&s;i&s;ted its primary and natural impul&s;e.</P>
<P>To conclude this head, the prevailing ten|dency of tho&s;e functions in which we are employed, is to promote virtue and piety; they will tempt the ob&s;tinately vicious to hy|pocri&s;y, but they could not cea&s;e to tempt them to this, without cea&s;ing to urge power|fully to univer&s;al goodne&s;s. Tho&s;e only will become hypocrites by being engaged in our profe&s;&s;ion, who would have been either di&s;|hone&s;t or abandoned, if they had followed ano|ther occupation.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of the vices imputed to our office is <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> leading us to regard an appearance of religion, or zeal for religious ob&s;ervances, as a full compen&s;ation for all
<PB N="428" REF="430">
vices and violations of morality.&mdash;But is there any &s;pirit again&s;t which the Scriptures, the only rule of our in&s;tructions, guard mankind with greater care? Can we teach the religion of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> without making it a great part of our bu&s;ine&s;s to warn our people again&s;t this vile perver&s;ion of devotion? What circum&s;tance can there be, then, in our profe&s;&s;ion, that puts us in peculiar danger of &s;uper&s;tition? This Author really mentions none. In&s;tead of &s;up|porting his charge, in&s;tead of attempting to prove, that &s;uper&s;tition is one of tho&s;e charac|ters, which are entirely our own, he ob&s;erves that all mankind almo&s;t have a &s;trong propen|&s;ity to it; an ob&s;ervation, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with its being peculiar to the clergy. Our of|fice, indeed, naturally tends to form us to a temper of devotion; but from the warmth of genuine devotion, &s;uper&s;tition never can ari&s;e. On the contrary, it is plain from the nature of the di&s;po&s;itions them&s;elves, as well as from the declarations of Scripture, that reverence, and love of God, gratitude to him, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his providence, regard to his authority, and to his judgment of us, and all the other parts of real piety lead to univer&s;al virtue, and can|not be completed without producing it. All mankind appear to be &s;en&s;ible of this. They will allow a per&s;on to be really ju&s;t or tem|perate, though &s;ome other virtues be plainly

The human heart is &s;o &s;trongly turned to love, that we eagerly take occa&s;ion for ex|erci&s;ing a peculiar degree of this affection, not only from relation, per&s;onal qualities, or fa|vours received, but al&s;o from more trivial cir|cum&s;tances, a name, a neighbourhood, or the like.

&mdash;If the intere&s;ts of clergymen of the &s;ame religion be really united more clo&s;ely, than the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e of other profe&s;&s;ions; our office has a direct tendency, by this cir|cum&s;tance, to prompt us &s;trongly to one &s;pe|cies of benevolence and public &s;pirit, and thus is peculiarly fit to promote one of the mo&s;t amiable virtues. The intere&s;ts of men of other profe&s;&s;ions not only are <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> becau&s;e each carries on his bu&s;ine&s;s apart, but often <HI>inter|fere,</HI> and by this means, the love which they ought to bear to one another, is extingui&s;hed. Ought it not to be mentioned to the honour of our profe&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of being objected to it as a reproach, that it does not expo&s;e us to this danger?&mdash;All particular attachments may, in|deed, be carried too far, and ob&s;truct the ex|erci&s;e of other &s;ocial virtues; love to a family may render a man negligent of the good of his country; even patrioti&s;m may make a man too carcle&s;s about the intere&s;ts of the kind. But is that con&s;titution of our nature which makes us capable of the&s;e attachments, to be blamed on this account? In like manner, if &s;ome clergymen pervert that ju&s;t benevolence which they owe to their &s;ociety, into a narrow party-&s;pirit, di&s;po&s;ing them to &s;acrifice the in|tere&s;ts of the laity, or leading them to aim at the &s;upport of their own peculiar tenets, or at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of antagoni&s;ts, in&s;tead of the

<HI>real</HI> intere&s;t of the order, which always coin|cides with the intere&s;t of truth and virtue, and, by con&s;equence, with the intere&s;t of man|kind; is the office to be therefore cen&s;ured? It gives occa&s;ion to this mi&s;conduct, only by containing a circum&s;tance which has a direct tendency to promote an amiable virtue, but which is capable of being abu&s;ed by the folly or perver&s;ene&s;s of men.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, our office tends &s;trongly to prevent the abu&s;es which might ari&s;e from an exce&s;&s;ive attach|ment to our own &s;ociety. We teach a religion which repre&s;ents us and all mankind as con|nected together by every endearing relation which can excite the tendere&s;t love, and by every &s;imilarity of condition, which can im|prove our love by &s;ympathy and fellow-feeling. Our office &s;ets frequently in our view the gene|ral connexions of the children of men; and it unites us with mankind by peculiar ties. It intere&s;ts us in their mo&s;t important concerns, it engages us in the mo&s;t affectionate inter|cour&s;e with their very &s;ouls. Benevolence can be cheri&s;hed only by tho&s;e exerci&s;es of benefi|cence, for which the circum&s;tances of men give opportunity. A mini&s;ter has all the &s;ame opportunities of doing good, with another man; and, if he really execute his of|fice, he mu&s;t have many opportunities pe|culiar to him&s;elf; for he can &s;eldom &s;pend a

Such employment is certainly fit to melt the heart into love, and to make it to overflow in &s;treams of good-will to the whole human race.&mdash;When this Author re|pre&s;ented the clergy as a &s;eparate body, wholly unconnected with &s;ociety, I am apt to think, that he had in his eye only one &s;et of clergy|men, tho&s;e prie&s;ts whom the law of celibacy and a mona&s;tic life cut off from all the ordi|nary relations to mankind. Indeed they are &s;carce a part of &s;ociety, they have an <HI>independ|ent</HI> intere&s;t, by which they are firmly united among them&s;elves, by which they are often prompted to con&s;pire in oppo&s;ing the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, and for promoting which their re|ligion is evidently framed.

He lays the charge, it mu&s;t be owned, with an uncommon diffidence; he had a&s;&s;erted boldly that the other vices <HI>are</HI> cha|racteri&s;tical of the clergy; but he only &s;ays that this <HI>&s;eems</HI> to belong to them. Yet his rea&s;oning has not &s;trength enough to be&s;tow even the <HI>appearance</HI> of truth on his a&s;&s;ertion.

But this author has di&s;covered, it &s;eems, that all this is perfectly the rever&s;e of truth.

They mu&s;t contract a &s;pirit <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> to that which re&s;ults from the <HI>true</HI> genius of their calling, before they can concur in giving &s;cope to <HI>ambition, pride,</HI> or a <HI>per&s;ecuting &s;pirit.</HI> Society can have no rea&s;on to be more jealous of their attempts, than of the attempts of any other cla&s;s of men; for they are not more apt to degenerate from the virtuous &s;pirit of their profe&s;&s;ion, and to promote faction or per&s;ecution, than other men are to become vicious, and to form de|&s;igns, and to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures, equally de&s;truc|tive of the peace and order of civil government. A peculiar jealou&s;y of the clergy, and a de&s;ire to depre&s;s them, will always indicate a prevail|ing corruption of manners, a di&s;affection to religion, an indifference about the practice of real virtue, and about the eternal happine&s;s of
<PB N="459" REF="461">
mankind, in the &s;ocieties or individuals who entertain that jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>IT was remarked, in the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that the enquiry which we propo&s;ed for the &s;ubject of it, is of a very practical na|ture. It &s;ugge&s;ts important in&s;tructions, both to <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and to the <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P>1. EVERY part of the inve&s;tigation now at|tempted, forces reflections into our view, which merit the attention of all the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. It &s;hows us, my reverend fathers and brethren, both the <HI>advantages</HI> and the <HI>difficulties</HI> of our &s;ituation; both the &s;trong <HI>obligations</HI> to virtue which we lie under, and the dangerous <HI>temptations</HI> to vice to which we are expo&s;ed. By exhibiting the former it urges us, <HI>&s;eeing we have this mini&s;try, not to faint</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 1.</NOTE>, till we have attained that blamele&s;s holine&s;s which is &s;o &s;trictly incumbent on us. By di&s;covering the latter, it warns us to <HI>take heed to our&s;elves</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE> with the mo&s;t con&s;tant vigilance, le&s;t we be &s;educed by them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>office of a Bi&s;hop</HI> is, indeed, <HI>a good,</HI> a worthy <HI>work</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. iii. 1.</NOTE>. It has the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to adorn the characters of tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it, with
<PB N="460" REF="462">
univer&s;al holine&s;s, the true beauty, the only excellence of the human &s;oul. It gives us the noble&s;t opportunities of &s;aving our&s;elves, by doing all that we can to promote the &s;alvation of others. The advantages which we enjoy, demand from us the pure&s;t and the &s;ublime&s;t virtue. The voice of mankind, the nature of our office, the credit of our religion, call upon us to guard carefully again&s;t every &s;in, and to &s;tudy to excell others in every amiable quality. In gratitude, in duty, in intere&s;t, in honour, by every po&s;&s;ible tie, we are indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to be <HI>blamele&s;s,</HI> to have our &s;ouls deeply tinctured with all real goodne&s;s, and to render our whole lives an uninterrupted &s;eries of con&s;picuous ho|line&s;s. Every degree of vice in us is &s;ingularly atrocious, not only in the opinion of the world, but in the eye of unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, and in the unerring judgment of God; and will be pu|ni&s;hed with the greate&s;t &s;everity: and what would be e&s;teemed only a defect of virtue in others, will ever be accounted a po&s;itive and heinous vice in us. In vain &s;hall any mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel expect to derive e&s;teem from the dignity of his calling, if he do not walk worthy of it. Its dignity ari&s;es from its holine&s;s. A vicious mini&s;ter will deba&s;e it more, in the opi|nion of the world, than all the groundle&s;s cen|&s;ures of its enemies. Nay, brethren, to our vices their reflections may ju&s;tly be imputed;
<PB N="461" REF="463">
for our vices alone put it in their power to cen&s;ure the genius of our profe&s;&s;ion, to revile our order, or to bla&s;pheme the go&s;pel for our &s;akes; our vices alone di&s;po&s;e mankind to li&s;ten, in any degree, to their a&s;per&s;ions, or hinder them from rejecting them with indignation.</P>
<P>BY improving the advantages which our occupation gives us, we may, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of God, which will never be wanting to us but through our own fault, attain the high|e&s;t degree of virtue: but by mi&s;improving them, we &s;hall &s;ink into the lowe&s;t degeneracy. As meat which is extremely nouri&s;hing to the healthful, may inflame dangerous di&s;tempers in the weak, &s;o advantages for cultivating vir|tue, which have the mo&s;t powerful influence on the well-di&s;po&s;ed, will contribute to harden the wicked in their vices. The danger of our falling &s;hort of that exalted virtue which our advantages render indi&s;pen&s;ible, and the dan|ger of our peri&s;hing for ever, which will ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;pring from our falling &s;hort of it, have appeared &s;o great to many pious per&s;ons of our profe&s;&s;ion, that they have not &s;crupled to expre&s;s their fears, that a &s;maller proportion of our order, than of other ranks of men, &s;hall obtain &s;alvation. Certainly, we cannot be too careful to impre&s;s upon our&s;elves the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of both the&s;e dangers, which the &s;trict|ne&s;s
<PB N="462" REF="464">
of our obligations and our &s;ignal advan|tages render very great. It is infinitely hazard|ous for a vicious man to enter into the pa&s;|toral office; it is infinitely hazardous for us to neglect the immediate application of its ad|vantages to the improvement of our own hearts; for if the peculiar means of holine&s;s which it affords, do not very quickly excite the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel to virtue, there is &s;carce a chance for their reformation. Where can they find means of reformation, more effica|cious than tho&s;e with which they have already refu&s;ed to comply? It is of great importance, that every per&s;on, who a&s;pires to this &s;acred office, &s;hould devote him&s;elf early to piety and virtue, that he may be qualified to improve its opportunities, and to avoid its dangers. It is of everla&s;ting importance to his own &s;oul. Every man who finds him&s;elf de&s;titute of the &s;eeds of exalted and uniform goodne&s;s, ought to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of engaging in a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to which his vices, of whatever kind they are, will be a reproach and ignominy. Whoever has entered into the pa&s;toral office ought to give up him&s;elf to the practice of its duties, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to confine him&s;elf to them, that he may not lo&s;e the ad|vantages for cultivating virtue, which this of|fice puts in his power. He ought to be ex|tremely attentive to the manner in which he
<PB N="463" REF="465">
exerci&s;es his &s;acred functions, that he may avoid the heinous vice which will infallibly ari&s;e from the negligent or the improper exerci&s;e of them, and attain that improvement of heart, which will be promoted by the diligent and right performance of the duties of his holy calling.</P>
<P>SOME vices, as intemperance, impiety, exce&s;&s;ive di&s;&s;ipation, are &s;o un&s;uitable to our profe&s;&s;ion, that they will be indulged only by the abandoned; they demou&s;trate a total de|pravation of heart, a mind lo&s;t to all the prin|ciples of goodne&s;s. In the mo&s;t degenerate &s;tate of things, the&s;e vices will not be very fre|quent in our &s;ociety; the lea&s;t approach to them is univer&s;ally reckoned &s;candalous. We &s;hould guard again&s;t the&s;e, becau&s;e they will infallibly render our characters odious, and all our labours u&s;ele&s;s. However &s;lightly they may be di&s;approved in others, let us remember, not only that they are highly blameable in their own nature, but al&s;o that the world will ever regard them with indignation in a clergyman, that even the perverted judgement of tho&s;e who practi&s;e them, will pronounce them dete&s;tible in him, that even they who &s;olicit him to commit them, and &s;eem to like his gaiety, will de&s;pi&s;e him in their hearts. Let not the exam|ple or corrupted &s;entiments of the world, let
<PB N="464" REF="466">
not an affectation of &s;pirit and freedom, let not the fear of being reckoned au&s;tere, moro&s;e, or &s;tubborn, let not any inducement, prevail with us to admit the lowe&s;t degree of the&s;e vices in|to our character or practice. The virtues op|po&s;ite to the&s;e are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve us from univer&s;al infamy; let us take care that we have not the appearance of them only, but that we really po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues them&s;elves, and excell in them. They are enforced upon us by the &s;pirit of our profe&s;&s;ion in its full &s;trength; they are inculcated by <HI>all</HI> the moral principles, by which our employment operates on the temper.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome other vices, which have not &s;o <HI>manife&s;t</HI> a repugnance to our profe&s;&s;ion, or which may even appear to &s;pring from a common and probable abu&s;e of it. But for that very rea&s;on, we have greater need to be upon our guard again&s;t them. Intemperate zeal and its kindred vices will in&s;inuate them|&s;elves more imperceptibly than tho&s;e which were mentioned before, will di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves more artfully, will more ea&s;ily elude the ob&s;ervation of the ignorant, or, perhaps, will be even con|&s;ecrated by them. In general, the vices which we are in greate&s;t danger of indulging, are tho&s;e which admit of the faire&s;t pretexts, and which are mo&s;t apt to be confounded with
<PB N="465" REF="467">
&s;ome virtuous principle; our profe&s;&s;ion does not afford all the motives to ab&s;tinence from the&s;e, which it affords to ab&s;tinence from other vices, though it affords all that their nature will allow. If we attend to the exhortations which the in&s;pired writers addre&s;s to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, we &s;hall find that they much oftener give us warning again&s;t the vices of this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;s, than again&s;t others; thus plainly intimating that we are obnoxious chiefly to the&s;e. To avoid every degree of the&s;e will re|quire the greate&s;t circum&s;pection. The&s;e will be more frequent in our &s;ociety than other vices. The&s;e alone can, with any <HI>plau&s;ibility,</HI> be charged on the &s;pirit of our office. If we indulge our&s;elves in the&s;e, their prevalence will furni&s;h our more di&s;cerning enemies with the mo&s;t &s;pecious arguments again&s;t us. In&s;tead of entertaining re&s;entment again&s;t them, let us turn their cen&s;ures to our own advantage. The mini&s;terial office has not &s;uch a tendency to any vice, as can ju&s;tly expo&s;e its &s;pirit to re|proach; but the vices which are imputed to it, may notwith&s;tanding be tho&s;e which a wicked or a carele&s;s mini&s;ter will mo&s;t probably in|dulge. Let us not be &s;atisfied with a convic|tion, that our <HI>office</HI> does not de&s;erve cen&s;ure; but let every individual take care, that <HI>he</HI> may not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it. Adver&s;aries of penetration will be &s;ure to attack us on the &s;ide where we are
<PB N="466" REF="468">
weake&s;t. Let us take warning; let us employ particular attention there; let us beware of every thing that can lead us into the vices which they impute to us. Our office has its peculiar temptations; let us not di&s;gui&s;e them from our&s;elves; let us rather be &s;olicitous to di&s;cover them: they cannot reflect di&s;honour on that office, or on religion; yet they may &s;ometimes put our virtue to a very difficult and hazardous trial; they will overcome us and &s;educe us into vice, if we be not vigilant and circum&s;pect. But if, through the grace of God, whom we &s;erve in the go&s;pel, we &s;tre|nuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t them, we &s;hall acquire &s;trong habits of &s;incere piety, unfeigned humility, diffu&s;ive benevolence, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, charity, and every amiable virtue which can adorn our &s;tation or our religion.</P>
<P>2. THE enquiry in which we have been engaged, likewi&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts u&s;eful in&s;tructions to the laity.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent age, and in this nation, infi|delity has erected its &s;tandard, and many have enli&s;ted in its &s;ervice. If there be any among the&s;e, who think that they have rejected the go&s;pel after a fair examination of its evidences, we will pray fervently to God, that he may have mercy upon them, and bring them <HI>to the</HI>
<PB N="467" REF="469">
<HI>knowledge of the truth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE>. We will be&s;eech them, for their own &s;akes, to take care that they have been really <HI>unprejudiced</HI> in their en|quiries. Prejudices <HI>again&s;t</HI> religion may in&s;i|nuate them&s;elves as imperceptibly as prejudices <HI>for</HI> it; and they are, at lea&s;t, as highly blame|able. If God has really given a revelation of his will to mankind, every degree of unfairne&s;s in examining its evidence, will be highly vi|cious in the judgment of rea&s;on and natural con&s;cience, and will evidently de&s;erve the &s;e|vere&s;t puni&s;hment. But, without pretending to judge of men's &s;ecret intentions, we may &s;urely &s;ay, that when men attack religion, ei|ther in public or private, either in conver&s;a|tion or from the pre&s;s, by throwing out undi&s;|tingui&s;hed reflexions again&s;t the clergy; when they exaggerate the failings of individual cler|gymen, and charge them on the whole body; when they attempt to reproach the &s;pirit of the mini&s;terial office, by partial or wrong repre&s;ent|ations of its nature; when they labour to over|turn religion, by rai&s;ing a groundle&s;s prejudice again&s;t the teachers of it; this affords a pre|&s;umption of prejudice, though perhaps un&s;u&s;|pected by them&s;elves, which, when it is pointed out to them, may ju&s;tly excite them to review the temper and care with which they have en|quired
<PB N="468" REF="470">
into religion. If an infidel be not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with blameable prejudice, he will cer|tainly confine him&s;elf, in his attacks again&s;t religion, to direct arguments, carefully avoid|ing every topic which may weaken its <HI>influ|ence,</HI> without deciding concerning its <HI>truth.</HI> Let illiberal reflexions again&s;t the clergy be left to the tribe of <HI>vulgar</HI> infidels&punc; who have not perhaps penetration enough to di&s;cover, that they do not amount to a full con&s;utation of chri&s;tianity. Let tho&s;e ab&s;tain from them, who are capable of perceiving, that many mi|ni&s;ters may be extremely vicious, and yet the office which they hold may have a virtuous tendency, and the go&s;pel may be true.</P>
<P>MY &s;ubject leads me al&s;o to addre&s;s the <HI>chri&s;t|ian</HI> people.

It has been often ob&s;erved, that modern dei&s;ts have derived, from tho&s;e very &s;criptures which they reject, ju&s;ter opinions in natural religion, than the wi&s;e&s;t heathens were able to form by una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on; and that the go&s;pel has thus in&s;en&s;ibly refined the principles even of its enemies.

greatly corrupted the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and <HI>practice</HI> even of tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>faith</HI> it could not directly &s;ubvert.
