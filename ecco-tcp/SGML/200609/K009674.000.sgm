<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN Men mi&s;take in one Thing,
'tis very u&s;ual to have the World
think they mi&s;take in every Thing;
and 'tis an ea&s;y thing to find a
Stone to throw at a Dog.</P>
<P>Had the poor <HI>Weavers,</HI> who I am now to
&s;peak of, brought their Complaints again&s;t the
exorbitant Wearing of <HI>Callicoes</HI> in a regular
and ju&s;tifiable Manner, and before the pro|per
Judges of tho&s;e Things; as their Conduct
could not have been reproach'd, &s;o the Grie|vance,
which now &s;uffers by their mi&s;take,
would, perhaps, have met with more Friends.</P>
<P>But wi&s;e and impartial Men will learn to
di&s;tingui&s;h between the Ju&s;tice of a Cau&s;e, and
the Mi&s;takes of the Managers of it; between
<PB N="4" REF="3">
the Rea&s;on of the Complaint, and the di&s;or derly
manner of Complaining: And this is all we &s;hall
have occa&s;ion to &s;ay of the poor mi&s;taken tumul|tuous
<HI>Weavers,</HI> leaving them to the Clemency
and Compa&s;&s;ion of the Government, whom they
have offended, but recommending the Grie|vance
under which they groan, to the &s;erious
Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e in who&s;e Power it is to
redre&s;s it.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Weavers</HI> &s;uffer under the general
Calamity of Trade; that they, and even the
whole Manufacturing part of the Nation, are
oppre&s;s'd by the exorbitant growth of clande|&s;tine
Trade, and the unrea&s;onable pouring in
of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Wrought Goods upon us. This
will admit of no Debate, at lea&s;t, none that
can be &s;upported by Rea&s;on: What little can be
&s;aid for it is &s;o ea&s;ily confuted and expos'd, and
has &s;o often been fully an&s;wer'd, that little
will be wanting now: But according to my Ti|tle,
to &s;tate the Ca&s;e clearly and impartially be|tween
Woollen and Silk Goods made at Home,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
and the Callicoes and Wrought Silks printed
here, or clande&s;tinely imported from Abroad.</P>
<P>In order to enter upon this Affair with all
po&s;&s;ible Clearne&s;s and Plainne&s;s, and, if we can,
to &s;trike at the Root of the Mi&s;chiefs we com|plain
of, I &s;hall fir&s;t lay down &s;ome general Pro|po&s;itions
as Fundamentals in this Que&s;tion of
Trade, obliging my &s;elf to give &s;uch Evidence
for the proof of them, as &s;hall take away all po&s;|&s;ible
Pretences to deny the Fact; and this I do
at fir&s;t, that we may have no &s;tum bling at the
Thre&s;hold, no cavelling at the Terms, or &s;huf|fling
off the Que&s;tion from one thing to ano|ther;
but that as I may talk to Men of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
I may talk likewi&s;e to their Under&s;tand|ing
and Conviction. My Propo&s;itions are,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Woollen and Silk Manufactures
of this Kingdom being the Staple of our
Trade, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and a&s;&s;ential
part of our Wealth, the Fund for our Expor|tation,
the Support of our Navigation, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the only Means we have for the Employing
and Sun&s;i&s;ting our Poor; it is therefore the
common Intere&s;t of the whole Kingdom to di&s;|courage
every other Manufacture, whether
foreign or a&s;&s;um'd, &s;o far as tho&s;e Manu|factures
are ruinous to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with
the Pro&s;perity of the &s;aid <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures
of Wool and Silk.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Wearing and U&s;ing Printed or
Painted Callicoes, as they are now almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally
worn and u&s;ed in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is
ruinous to, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Pro|&s;perity
of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, as well
tho&s;e of Wool as tho&s;e of Silk.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the total prohibiting the Wearing
and u&s;ing of Printed and Painted Callicoes in
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is not ruinous to, or incon&s;i|&s;tent
with the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI>
Trade; or, <HI>to put it into an Affirmative that
may be more capable of Evidence,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Trade may and would remain in a very
<PB N="7" REF="6">
thriving and flouri&s;hing Condition, and be
carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the
Adventurers, tho all the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and of <HI>Ireland</HI> were effectually limitted
from, and prohibited the wearing and u&s;ing of
Printed and Painted Callicoes.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Printed and Painted Callicoes
now worn and u&s;ed in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> come un|der
four Denominaitons, <HI>ALL pernicious and
de&s;tructive</HI> to our Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) &s;uch as be|ing
inported by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are either printed
in the <HI>Indies</HI> or in <HI>Holland,</HI> and clande&s;tinely
run on Shoar here, in &s;pite of former Prohi|bitions:
<HI>OR</HI> &s;uch as being imported here by
our own <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and prohibited
to be worn becau&s;e printed in <HI>India,</HI> are pre|tended
to be exported, but are privately run
on Shoar again and &s;old: <HI>OR</HI> &s;uch as being
printed here, are entered and &s;hip'd for Ex|portatian,
in order to dram back the Duties
on the Stamps but are re landed and &s;old
here; and la&s;tly, &s;uch as are Printed here,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
and legally worn and u&s;ed, and under the
<HI>Colour of which ALL</HI> the other Frauds are
practis d and conceal'd.</P>
<P N="5">5. That this clande&s;tine Importation and Re|landing
of Printed and Painted Callicoes, is
no way to be prevented, neither is it in the
reach of the Wit and Power of Man to put a
&s;top to it by any other Means but by effectu|ally
preventing and prohibiting the wearing,
and u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome other e&s;&s;ential Propo&s;itions in
Trade, which will come in cour&s;e to be laid
down for the carrying on this Argument, as
we proceed in the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e; but
I &s;hall re&s;erve them <HI>in petto</HI> till I &s;ee whether
the Age is weak enough to &s;truggle with things
&s;o &s;elfevident as the&s;e, and till I &s;ee what it
is can be offer'd, <HI>if any thing &s;hall be mu|&s;tred
up,</HI> again&s;t the&s;e five.</P>

<HEAD>A brief State of the Que&s;tion
Between the
PRINTED and PAINTED
CALLICOES,
AND THE
Woollen and Silk Manufacture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT the IMPORTATION of
Wrought Silks and Printed Cal|licoes
from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and
allowing the u&s;e of them here
when imported, has all along been found
prejudicial to the Home Con&s;umption of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures in <HI>Great-Britan,</HI>
needs no other Proof than the late
Acts of Parliament, which were obtain'd in
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Con&s;equence of the general Application of
the <HI>Manufacturers,</HI> as well Ma&s;ters as Work|men,
through the whole Kingdom, to pro|hibit
and limit their Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>In doing this, the Parliament, who&s;e
Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice was very con&s;picuous
in that very Ca&s;e, entred into the true Me|rits
of the Cau&s;e, &s;earch'd it to the bottom,
and weigh'd the Allegations on every &s;ide.
The Members were neither clamour'd into
it by the <HI>Weavers,</HI> byafs'd to it by Parties,
or hurry'd into it by the multitude of Pe|titions
from the Counties and Corporations
they repre&s;ented; but the Weight of the
Cau&s;e &s;upported it &s;elf; the Nature of the
Thing pleaded it, and their own well|weigh'd
Rea&s;on importun'd them to it: The
thing was &s;elf-evident; the Humor of the
People, <HI>as too often is the Fate of Nations,</HI>
&s;eem'd, at that time, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd again&s;t their
Intere&s;t, and being hurry'd down the Stream
<PB N="11" REF="10">
of their Fancy, they ran headlong into the
greate&s;t Neglect and Contempt of the
Growth and Manufactures of their own
Country and People, and embrac'd, with
a Violence in their Temper not to be re|&s;i&s;ted,
the Silks and Callicoes of <HI>India,</HI> in
a manner even ridiculous to them&s;elves, as
well as fatal to their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Extravagance of that Time cannot
be &s;o entirely forgot, as that we &s;hould not
reflect how the Ladies converted their Car|pets
and Quilts into Gowns and Petticoats,
and made the broad and uncouth Bordures
of the former &s;erve in&s;tead of the rich La|ces
and Embroideries they were u&s;ed to
wear, and dre&s;s more like the Merry-An|drews
of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, than like the
Ladies and Wives of a Trading People.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence was, what any one
might thave fore&s;een would be, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the
Ruin of our Manufactures, the &s;tagnating
<PB N="12" REF="11">
of our Trade, the &s;top of Employment, and
the &s;tarving our Poor: The Cry was uni|ver&s;al,
not the <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> Weavers only,
&s;elt it; the Calamity was general, and the
Complaint came from every Corner of the
Nation.</P>
<P>As all Mi&s;chiefs in their Exorbitance tend
naturally to their own Cure, &s;o it was hear;
&s;eeing the thing was fatal in it &s;elf to our
Trade, it was our Felicity that it run on to
&s;uch Extremes as allarm'd the whole King|dom;
for this awaken'd the Parliament to
its Redre&s;s; Such we cannot but hope will
be the Ca&s;e again; for like Cau&s;es generally
produce like Effects.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of the Legi&s;lature might
pa&s;s with us all, for Rea&s;on, in a Ca&s;e of
much more Con&s;equence than this; but we
have yet more powerful Auxiliaries to bring
in Aid of the Ca&s;e before us; I'll in&s;i&s;t
upon two only, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The Pattern of our
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Neighbours; 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Succe&s;s of our own
Prohibitions. I begin with the la&s;t.</P>
<P>What the Parliament did in the Cafe I
ju&s;t now mentioned, was abundantly ju&s;tify'd
in the Succe&s;s: What can be more encou|raging
to apply the &s;ame way, &s;eeing the
Cafe is the &s;ame?</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Flux of foreign Manu|factures
&s;topp'd and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods
prohibited, but the Trade reviv'd; the Face
of Things chang'd; Bu&s;ine&s;s and Plenty
&s;ucceeded to want of Employment, and
want of Bread; the Numbers of Poor flock|ing
to the Manufactures for Employment,
and the Encrea&s;e of the Con&s;umption of
our Manufactures reviv'd the whole Nation.
Nothing could be a &s;tronger and more
convincing Evidence of what had been
alledg'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the &s;o general wearing
and u&s;ing <HI>Ea&s;t. India</HI> printed Callicoes, &amp;c.
had been the Ruin of our Trade, had put a
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;top to the Employment of the Weavers,
and, in a word, had <HI>&s;tarv'd our Poor.</HI> I
&s;hall come to this again in its Place.</P>
<P>I come, in the next place, to the Exam|ple
of our Neighbours, and particularly
the <HI>French,</HI> a Nation but too wife in the
mo&s;t proper Methods for erecting and en|couraging
Manufactures; of which there
are &s;uch Te&s;timonies given in the Admini|&s;tration
of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> who was ju&s;t|ly
call'd, <HI>The Father of the</HI> French <HI>Manu|factures,</HI>
as we have felt the Con&s;equences
of in Trade for many Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>French East-India</HI> Company was E|&s;tabli&s;h'd
by the enterpri&s;ing <HI>Genius</HI> of the
&s;aid Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert</HI> in the Year 1664, and
the Edict pa&s;s'd the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th of <HI>August</HI> 1686,
&s;ettling all their Privileges for 50 Years;
and they begun with great Advantages, tho'
they had not Succe&s;s, occa&s;ioned by their
own Mi&s;management: However, the King
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of <HI>France,</HI> finding the u&s;ing and wearing
of <HI>India</HI> wrought Silks, Cottons, and Cal|licoes
painted and printed, whether in <HI>In|dia</HI>
or at Home, began to encroach upon
the Manufactures of his Subjects, as well
Silk as Wool; and fore-&s;eeing that it would
be the Ruin of both, for which he thought
him&s;elf oblig'd to pre&s;erve the utmo&s;t Con|cern,
as being the Fundamental of the Ri|ches
of his Kingdom, he effectually prohi|bited
the Wearing and U&s;e of them, whe|ther
printed at Home or Abroad, among his
Subjects, by an Edict in the Year 1686,
and under very &s;evere Penalties: And the
late King of <HI>France,</HI> being mov'd by his
Council of Trade, from time to time, by
&s;everal &s;ub&s;equent Edicts, confirm'd tho&s;e
Prohibitions, adding farther Penalties, more
&s;evere than before, for enforcing the Exe|cution:
By all which it appears, of what
Con&s;equence this Matter was thought to be
for the pre&s;erving the Manufactures of his
own Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
The Government of <HI>France</HI> proceeding
&s;till upon the &s;ame Maxims, of a ju&s;t Policy
in Trade, continue as Tenacious of their
former Care for their own Manufactures as
ever: And this appears by the Provi&s;ion
made by &s;ub&s;equent Edicts to continue the
&s;ame Prohibitions, in the &s;tricte&s;t manner,
of all &s;uch <HI>East-India</HI> Goods as are hurtful
to their Manufactures, of which the follow|ing
is a flaming In&s;tance: (<HI>viz.</HI>) We all
know, that the pre&s;ent Government has u|nited
their old <HI>East-India</HI> Company to their
new <HI>West-India</HI> Company; and what great
Advances of Credit that Union has made in
<HI>France</HI>; yet, &s;o far is the pre&s;ent Govern|ment
from neglecting their own Manufa|ctures,
by forgetting to prohibit the U&s;e of
the Callicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the &s;aid Company
may import; and &s;o far are they from ima|gining
that the &s;aid Company &s;hould not
flouri&s;h and thrive, notwith&s;tanding the
Prohibition of tho&s;e Goods, tho' &s;o con&s;i|derable
a Branch of their Importation, that
<PB N="17" REF="16">
tho&s;e Prohibitions are all expre&s;ly renew'd,
repeated and confirm'd, by the Edict of Re|union,
as appears by the IXth and Xth Ar|ticles
of the Grant to the &s;aid new E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
Company, as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Artic.</HI> IX. 'We permit the &s;aid Com|pany
to import from the Countries within
their Grant, all &s;orts of Stuffs of pure
Silk, and of Silk and Cotton mix'd with
Gold and Silver, Bark of Trees, and
Callicoes dy'd, painted and &s;trip'd. We
require, that the &s;aid Merchandizes pro|hibited
in this Kingdom may not be &s;old,
but on expre&s;s Conditions of being export|ed
to foreign Parts, and that for this End
they may be laid up in the Ware-Hou&s;es
of our Farmer-Generals, under two Keys,
of which the Farmer-General, or his De|puties,
&s;hall keep one, and the Directors of
the Company, or their Sub&s;titutes, the o|ther;
and that all other nece&s;&s;ary Precau|tions
be taken to hinder the Sale of the
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;aid Merchandize for Dome&s;tick Con&s;ump|tion.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Artic.</HI> X. 'The &s;aid Company may al&s;o
import, from the Countries within their
Grant, all forts of White Callicoes, Raw
Silks, Coffee, Drugs, Spices, Metals, and
other Things, except tho&s;e prohibited by
the preceeding Article, paying the Duties
which are actually paid by the <HI>India</HI> Com|pany,
according to the Edicts, Declara|tions,
Arrets and Regulations, of the Kings
our Predece&s;&s;ors.'</Q></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the very Thing done in <HI>France</HI>
which we want here; and for the very &s;ame
Rea&s;ons for which we &s;tand &s;o much in need
of it here; which Rea&s;ons we cannot doubt
will &s;ub&s;i&s;t with the &s;ame Force here as there;
the Foundations of Foreign Import, &amp; Home
Manufactures, being the &s;ame, and e&s;pecially,
becau&s;e he cannot doubt, but that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Parliament will appear in&s;pir'd with all the
<PB N="19" REF="18">
ju&s;t Principles of Care and Concern for the
Good of our People, and the Pro&s;perity of
our Trade, as the Councils of the late King
of <HI>France</HI> could be for his Subjects.</P>
<P>But I cannot forbear taking Notice here,
how much &s;tronger the Argument is on our
Side for the doing this now, than it ever
was before, even for this particular Rea&s;on,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> have, upon their
new E&s;tabli&s;hment, continued their Prohi|bitions.
I explain my &s;elf thus:</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have not only re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd
the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> but they have put it into
Hands which are not like to neglect it, run
in Debt in the <HI>Indies</HI>; or &s;ell the Liberty
of Trade to others; but they who are now
entru&s;ted with the Privilege, know very
well how to make u&s;e of it, and want no
Stock to carry it on: And as they are capa|ble
both in Knowledge of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
Stock for the managing of it, &s;o they appear
<PB N="20" REF="19">
re&s;olute to proceed immediately upon it, and
we are told, they have already taken up four
large Ships for the carrying on the Trade,
and that they talk of taking up &s;everal more.
The <HI>Flemmings</HI> under the Inperial Com|mi&s;&s;ion
or Charter, are not only doing the
&s;ame, but are actually embark'd in the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade, have &s;everal Ships now Abroad
and one great Ship ju&s;t arriv'd from <HI>India</HI> at
<HI>O&s;tend,</HI> being the &s;econd that they have re|ceived
&s;ince their entring upon that Trade:
And we are likewi&s;e told, that the Govern|ment
of the <HI>Au&s;trian Netherlands</HI> has already
re&s;olv'd on the prohibiting the Con&s;umption
of Printed &amp; Painted Callicoes among them;
and that they will be publickly prohibited
there as they are in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Let any impartial Per&s;on then judge,
whether we have not ju&s;t Rea&s;on to be
allarm'd at the&s;e Mea&s;ures, while we lie
open to a &s;muggling Trade &s;o generally
carried on thro' this whole Kingdom, and
<PB N="21" REF="20">
&s;o impo&s;&s;ible now to be prevented: Whither
mu&s;t the va&s;t Quantities of Callicoes which
the&s;s two new <HI>East-India</HI> Companies will
import, I &s;ay, Whither mu&s;t they go?
Whither but to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> where the People are &s;o fond of
them, and where it is &s;o ea&s;y to get them
on Shore.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company has already
&s;hew'd them&s;elves apprehen&s;ive of Succe&s;s
of the new E&s;tabli&s;h'd Imperial Company in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> nor can they be ju&s;tly unconcern'd
at the &s;etting up a Company in <HI>France,</HI>
upon &s;o potent a Stock as that of 50 Mil|lions:
But what then have we not to fear
for our Woollen and Silk Manufactures,
which are &s;o oppre&s;s'd already with clan|de&s;tine
Importations of Silks and Callicoes
from Abroad, as well as Printing them at
Home, and when the <HI>French</HI> will not fail
to bring in Quantities equal to the Opportu|nities
which they have to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ind them?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
We may appeal for this, to any one that
is acquainted on tho&s;e Shores of <HI>England</HI>
which lie neare&s;t to <HI>France</HI>; are not <HI>French</HI>
Brandies, <HI>French</HI> Wines, and <HI>French</HI> Silks to
be had almo&s;t in as great Plenty in our Port-Towns
on that &s;ide of the Country, as in
&s;ome Parts of <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, and will it not
be the &s;ame thing with <HI>India</HI> Goods? Can
<HI>Rumney Mar&s;h</HI> want <HI>French</HI> Callicoes, where
all <HI>French</HI> Goods are, <HI>as it were,</HI> as familiar
to them as in <HI>France?</HI> Can tho&s;e People
that know how to carry off whole Freights
of Wool, the mo&s;t bulky of all Merchan|dize,
be ignorant to take on Shoar <HI>French</HI>
Callicoes, <HI>French</HI> Wrought Silks, <HI>French
Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods of all Kinds? It cannot be
doubted, but when the <HI>French</HI> come to have
a Quantity of Callicoes always by them, and
no con&s;umption for them at Home, they will
find Ways and Means to croud them in up|on
us, with much more Ea&s;e than they do
now their Wines and Brandies. What the
Con&s;equence of this will be to our Wool|len
<PB N="23" REF="22">
and Silk Manufactures, is very plain:
They mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd nothing can pre|vent
it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;erve to let us &s;ee, that the
pre&s;ent Debate is not the Concern of a few
People in <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> only, tho' their Po|verty
and Di&s;tre&s;s happens to be neare&s;t our
View at this time, as their Complaints have
been loude&s;t: But, in a word, the whole
Body is effected, the whole Intere&s;t of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures throughout
the Kingdom is concern'd in it; I mean, as
to tho&s;e Goods which concern our Wearing
Apparel and Furniture, which is the Bulk
of our Manufactures; nay, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company them&s;elves are concern'd in it;
and, I believe, it might be very ea&s;y to
prove, by a ju&s;t Calculation, that if the&s;e
Companies now &s;et up in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
pro&s;per and thrive, as it is more than
probable they will, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will &s;uffer more by their
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Importing their Callicoes here, and thereby
&s;haring the Trade with them, or rather
taking it from them, then they will, by the
general putting a &s;top upon the Con&s;umpti|on,
and thereby checking the Foreigners
in their beginning; &s;o that upon the whole
of the two, the Prohibition &s;eems to me
to be no Evil at all, but, rather an Advan|tage
to them.</P>
<P>It was, without que&s;tion, an unaccount|able
Mi&s;take in tho&s;e who &s;ollicited the fir&s;t
Prohibition of <HI>India</HI> printed Callicoes, that
they contented them&s;elves with prohibiting
the U&s;e of Callicoes printed Abroad, but
did not in&s;i&s;t upon prohibiting the Wearing
and U&s;e of tho&s;e printed at Home, as Things
in them&s;elves equally ruinous to our Manu|factures;
they had not then left the Door
open to the Printing and Painting them in
<HI>England,</HI> a Trade then &s;carce known; under
colour of which, all &s;orts of Callicoes, where|&s;oever
printed, have been worn here, and
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Foreigners thereby encouraged to pour them
in upon us by the Arts of clande&s;tine Trade,
and our People impo&s;e upon us by re-landing
their own; in which, by the way, the known
and wilful Perjury that attends it, is one of
the lea&s;t Things in our Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But now the Work is to be done over a|gain,
with this Difficulty in the Difference,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that now we have the Pretences of
the <HI>Callicoe Printers</HI> to &s;truggle with, their
calling the Callicoes a Manufacture, becau&s;e
Painted and Printed here; tho' the&s;e are in
them&s;elves meer Trifles, like that of the Num|bers
of Families employ'd in Printing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
I &s;ay, Trifles, when compar'd with the Ma|nufactures
them&s;elves which we plead for,
and the Numbers of Families and People
maintain'd by, and employ'd in them; of
which I believe I am not arrogant, when I
&s;ay, it is ridiculous to talk of any Proportion.</P>
<P>The Work has al&s;o another Difficulty in
<PB N="26" REF="25">
its way, or rather a pretended Difficulty;
that is to &s;ay, I fore&s;ee that &s;ome People in|tend
to call this a Difficulty, I mean, the
Fund form'd upon the Stamps on Callicoes,
appropriated, perhaps, to &s;uch or &s;uch U&s;es,
or as Security for &s;uch and &s;uch Loans:
But as all tho&s;e Funds are, to our great
Satisfaction, made redeemable by Parlia|ment,
we have no more to do but to convince
our Repre&s;entatives of the Nece&s;&s;ity of re|deeming
them, and leave the Hou&s;e, which
is the in exhau&s;tible Fund of Funds, to their
own Methods for finding an equivalent Se|curity
to the Satisfaction of the Lenders;
and yet, even in this Point, when the Hou&s;e
&s;hall legitimate &s;uch an Attempt, &s;omething
may be &s;aid farther.</P>
<P>Difficulties therefore are no Di&s;courage|ment,
where ab&s;olute Necce&s;&s;ity is the Mo|tive:
The Thing carries an apparent Nece&s;|&s;ity
in it; it mu&s;t be remedied, or our Trade
mu&s;t be Ruin'd, our Manufactures be at an
<PB N="27" REF="26">
End, and our poor not &s;ent a Begging on|ly,
but indeed be Starv'd. And here,
were it any thing to the Purpo&s;e, I could
&s;pend &s;ome time in Exclamation, at the
prepo&s;terous unthinking Humour of our
People, who, upon all Occa&s;ions, run di|rectly
counter to their Intere&s;t, as a Trad|ing
Nation, in &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;o evident a
manner as this of wearing Printed Callicoes;
or, at lea&s;t, wearing them &s;o as to make it an
univer&s;al Mode. We often &s;ee Clothiers,
Drugget-Makers, Sergemakers, Stuff-makers
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> dre&s;s them&s;elves and their Families
in the Cloth, or Druggets, or Serges, or
Stuffs they make; and tho' they may not
be &s;o very like their Neighbours, they will
give this ready An&s;wer, (<HI>viz.</HI>) '<HI>Tis my
own Trade; 'tis my own Manufacture.</HI> And
the An&s;wer is allow'd to be very rer&s;ona|ble;
Why &s;hould it not be a National An|&s;wer,
as well as a Family An&s;wer? Why
&s;hould not an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, or an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Lady, reject foreign and de&s;tructive <HI>Gew|gaws,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
and chu&s;ing to wear the Woollen and
Silk of our own Product and Manufacture,
give this for a Rea&s;on for it, <HI>Tis our own
Trade; 'tis our own Manufacture.</HI></P>
<P>Let us go to the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI>
for In&s;truction, as <HI>Solamon</HI> &s;ends the Sluggard
to the Ant: Are they prevaild with to lay
by their own Manufactures for any of Ours?
No; 'tis evident, we are &s;o far from being
able to place any of our Manufactures among
them, that they de&s;pi&s;e the Propo&s;al; and
refu&s;e to &s;ell tho&s;e Goods, which we have
<HI>&s;o little need of,</HI> but for that ready Money,
which we have <HI>&s;o little need to part with.</HI></P>
<P>But this is a large Field; I refer it to the
Time when the Battle &s;hall be more clo&s;ely
join'd; then we may find time to talk more
feelingly of the Folly of carrying Money to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> to buy that, which we ought
rather to give Money to be without.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who, as un|capable
<PB N="29" REF="28">
as they may be to judge of their Na|tional
Intere&s;ts, are yet wi&s;er in this part, by
the Strength of meer Nature, than we are,
who pretend to &s;o much Knowledge; for
they wear their own Manufactures; not can
we bring them to alter the manner of their
Cloathing, any more than the Matter of it.</P>
<P>Some have alledg'd for a Rea&s;on of this,
the Climate in the <HI>Indies</HI> being &s;uited to the
Manufactures they make; and that nothing
can be &s;o light, &s;o clean, &s;o plea&s;ant in &s;uch
hot Countries, as the Callicoes and Silks of
their own making: But we might very well
an&s;wer this, by giving the Patterns of
our fine Stuffs; &s;ome of which, as well as
the manner of wearing them in hot Coun|tries,
are much Cooler, and much more
&s;uited to the Heat of the warme&s;t Climate,
than the uncouth Fa&s;&s;ions, great Sleeves
and pleated Gowns of the <HI>Indians</HI> who even
load them&s;elves, rather than dre&s;s them|&s;elves
with their Callicoes and other Manu|factures
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of their own Make. Any Traveller
might be left to judge of this, who has &s;een
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Peru,</HI> at <HI>Lima,</HI> at <HI>Panama
Carthagena,</HI> and &s;uch-like hot Places, where
they dre&s;s much cooler and lighter in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> Stuffs and Cloth, nay, even in
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Black Bayes, than the <HI>Indians</HI> on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Coromandel,</HI> or in the
Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> do in their Silks and Cal|licoes;
but Nature dictates to the&s;e Nations
to cultivate their own Produce, to con|&s;ume
their own Manufacture, and en|courage
their own Commerce: And Nature
would dictate the &s;ame thing to us, if we did
not ob&s;tinately put out Nature's Eyes, and
act again&s;t Nature, in the pur&s;uit of the
mo&s;t untractable part of our Faculties, I
mean, Humour and Fancy.</P>
<P>Certainly, if we were free from this Trade-Frenzy,
and were to act by the Dictates of
Common Sen&s;e, we &s;hould reflect, that the
Woollen Manufacture is the Staple of our
<PB N="31" REF="30">
ginal Fountain of our Wealth, and, as I &s;aid
in my <HI>Introduction,</HI> it is <HI>the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part
of the Riches of the Rich, and the principal
Means we have for the employing our Poor.</HI>
Many things might be &s;aid to prove, and
&s;ome to illu&s;trate whatever is contain'd in
the&s;e Generals, concerning our Woollen-Manufacture;
but I am loath to &s;uppo&s;e my
&s;elf talking to any People &s;o ignorant as not
to know it, or &s;o partial as not to acknow|ledge
it. If I can meet with any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>
&s;o weak as to di&s;pute it, I undertake, at
Demand, to expo&s;e them, and prove my
Propo&s;ition, both at once.</P>
<P>The Premi&s;es then being granted, my In|ference
is as ju&s;t, namely, <HI>that it is the com|mon
Intere&s;t of the whole Kingdom to di&s;cou|rage
every other Manufacture, &s;o far as
tho&s;e Manufactures, ruinous</HI> to, <HI>and incon|&s;i&s;tent</HI>
with <HI>the Pro&s;perity of</HI> our Own.</P>
<P>The late King of <HI>France,</HI> who &s;o well un|der&s;tood
<PB N="32" REF="31">
the Intere&s;t of his Subjects in Trade,
is a &s;tanding Authority for this very thing:
All the Edicts publi&s;h'd in <HI>France</HI> on this
Subject, &s;uch as in the Year 1686, and in
1689, and in 1697, prohibiting the Printing
and Painting of Callicoes in <HI>France,</HI> and the
&s;elling Callicoes Printed or Painted in <HI>India</HI>
when Imported into <HI>France,</HI> are fortified
with this Rea&s;on, as &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify
their Government in the &s;aid Prohibition.
(viz.) <HI>that they were prejudicial to the Ma|nufactures
of Wooll and Silk, already e&s;ta|bli&s;bed
in</HI> France.</P>
<P>And there are two things in tho&s;e Edicts
of the King of <HI>France</HI> which are very re|markable,
and which I re&s;erve for farther
Explanation, if I find occa&s;ion to &s;peak in
this Cau&s;e herea&s;ter; I &s;ay, two things are
very remarkable in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s
Prohibitions and Limitation of his <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company's Trade, which &s;tand as
Precedents for our Practice; the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons
<PB N="33" REF="32">
being much more &s;trong and forcible at
this time in our Circum&s;tances, than they
could then be in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That in the Edict or Arret, prohi|biting
or forbidding the Painting &amp; Print|ing
of Callicoes in <HI>France,</HI> is al&s;o included a
&s;trict Prohibition of the Painting and Print|ing
any kind of Linen Cloath of Hemp or
Flax, tho' &s;uch Linen was the Growth and
Manufacture of his own Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That in his Limitation of the
importations of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company,
there is this Clau&s;e; That whereas the
Company were allow'd to import &s;ome cer|tain
Wrought Silks, named in the Edict, to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, &s;o,
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> they were oblig'd to bring in no more;
and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> they were oblig'd, in con&s;i|deration
of that Liberty only, I &s;ay, they
were obliged to export to the <HI>Indies</HI> the
<PB N="34" REF="33">
value of 500000 Livers a Year in Goods of
the Growth and Manufactures of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And even this Condition did not continue
long; for the Council of Trade there, con&s;i|dering
that the con&s;umption of the Manu|factures,
was by no means an Equivalent
for the Injury tho&s;e Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' but to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, did to
the Manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> that Grant was
al&s;o revok'd and the Goods entirely prohi|bited,
under the mo&s;t rigorous Penalties,
as they continue to be this Day.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Clau&s;es are of &s;uch moment in
the Ca&s;e before us, and dictate &s;o clearly
not only what we have to &s;eek, and what
to complain of, with re&s;pect to our Maun|factures,
and to our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company,
but al&s;o the Rea&s;ons of it, that I cannot
but think it very much for the Publick Ser|vice
to publi&s;h the &s;evral Edicts, in which
the&s;e Clau&s;es, and the Rea&s;on and Cau&s;es
<PB N="35" REF="34">
given for them are contain'd, accordingly
they are plac'd in the Clo&s;e of this
Work.</P>
<P>Thus I have touch'd at the Heads of this
Matter, and have pa&s;s'd them over without
other Enlargments then &s;uch as the pre&s;ent
Occa&s;ion makes nece&s;&s;ary. This E&s;&s;ay, <HI>for
it is no more,</HI> is but a Specimen of the Con|trover&s;y,
every one of the&s;e Heads having
nece&s;&s;ary Explanations attending them, and
long debated Points of Commerce to &s;peak
to, in order to &s;et the whole Affair in a
clear Light; all which it may be to the pur|po&s;e
to enlarge upon herea&s;ter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this
Affair, without turning a little to the Trad|ing
part of Mankind, and e&s;pecially the
Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures in this
Nation: 'Tis not a little &s;trange to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="36" REF="35">
how unconcern'd we &s;it, and &s;eem to enjoy
our &s;elves in a perfect compo&s;ure of Mind,
and a mo&s;t inimitable Tranquility; when our
general Commerce, by which we all &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
langu&s;hes, and, as it were, expires in our
&s;ight. At Home, foreign Manufactures en|croach
upon us; Abroad, they are prepa|ring
new Projects to attack us; and as they
&s;eem united to Undo us, &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;ay,
we &s;eem unanimous in the Re&s;olution of
being Undone.</P>
<P>How can we &s;it &s;till and &s;ee the Bread
thus taken out of our labouring Peoples
Mouths, even by tho&s;e very Men who ought
to be equally concern'd with us to prevent
it? The Wearing and U&s;e of Callicoes, is
evidently the Ruin of our Manufactures:
If we can di&s;tingui&s;h between the Manu|factures
and the Manufacturers; if the Em|polyment
can be lo&s;t, and the Workmen
not &s;uffer; if the Trade can die, and the
Trade&s;men live; then I have no Foundati|on
<PB N="37" REF="36">
for my Di&s;cour&s;e, no Rea&s;on for this
Expo&s;tulation.</P>
<P>Nay, if this was a particular Article of
Trade only, if a few Families were to be
ruin'd of this or that particular Employ|ment
only, and the main of our People
not be effected with it; we might be &s;ilent,
and the Oppo&s;ers might &s;ay, we made more
Noi&s;e of it than there was occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Evil is general, and the Mi&s;|chiefs
which attend it are &s;o &s;preading, that
the whole Nation is more or le&s;s effected,
from the Gentleman of the greate&s;t Quality
and E&s;tate, to the meane&s;t Wool-cumber,
and that we are inevitably to feel the Con|&s;equences
of it: How can we, I &s;ay, &s;it un|concern'd,
and &s;ee out Families impoveri&s;h'd,
and the Foundation laid for the Ruin of our
Po&s;terity, and yet take no Notice of it? It
is certainly our Concern, in a more particu|lar
manner, to APPEAR, not in Arms, not
<PB N="38" REF="37">
in Mobs and Tumults, that neither is a
lawful Way of Appearing, nor would it
give the lea&s;t Aid in the Matter. Trade
is the Daughter of Peace, and draws its
principal Nouri&s;hment from the publick
Tranquillity: No Men in their Sen&s;es can
propo&s;e rai&s;ing Tumults and Riots for the
promoting Trade, neither is it the way to
engage the Government, the Parliament,
or the Mini&s;try, to redre&s;s our Grievances
in Trade. Such violent Ways only arm
Power again&s;t us, and engage Governors to
be our Enemies. My Arguments all run
another Way, and if I mi&s;take not, have
ten times more Force in them with wi&s;e
Governments, than all the Clamours of a
Rabble can &s;uppo&s;e to have.</P>
<P>I move you fir&s;t to &s;ee the Mi&s;chief: To
that end, I &s;et it in a clear Light, prove
the Fact, &s;hew you the &s;low degrees by
which the Poi&s;on works, how in&s;en&s;ibly it
grows upon you, and yet how &s;en&s;ibly &s;ome
<PB N="39" REF="38">
parts of Trade feel it already, and how cer|tainly
all other parts will be effected by it.</P>
<P>I move you then to put your Hands to
all Legal Preventions; I aim at no other:
I move you to joyn in all ju&s;t Repre&s;enta|tions,
both of the Mi&s;chief and the Remedy,
to tho&s;e in who&s;e Power it is to relieve you
I mean, your Parliament-Men; your Re|pre&s;entatives;
who, as they are mo&s;t of them
cho&s;en by the &s;everal Trading Corporations
of <HI>England,</HI> may be more particularly call'd
the Repre&s;entatives of the Trading-Part
of the Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the profe&s;t Phy&s;icians of all our
Trading Maladies; I may &s;ay, 'tis their Bu|&s;ine&s;s
to heal you, and I am &s;ure it is in their
Power; repre&s;ent it to them in Parliament,
and repre&s;ent it to them out of Parliament;
let them come up to Parliament fairly ap|pris'd
of the Ca&s;e; fully convine'd of the
Ju&s;tice of your Complaints, and the ab&s;o|lute
Nece&s;&s;ity there is of relieving you: Let
<PB N="40" REF="39">
them &s;ee it; make them Witne&s;&s;es, in the
Countries where they live, of the Decay
of the Manufactures; of the Abatement
made upon the Poor in their Wages; of the
Numbers of Poor that de&s;ert, and run from
one Work to another for want of Employ|ment.
Shew them the Rolls of your Pari|&s;hes,
which, I am &s;atisfy'd, will di&s;cover
how many Families, more than ever, are
li&s;ted among your Pen&s;ioners; for whom
Pari&s;h Provi&s;ion is nece&s;&s;arily made, for want
of their getting Bread by the Works they
were wont to be employ'd in; &s;hew them
the langui&s;hing Circum&s;tances of the People,
as <HI>the Effect</HI>; and then lay before them the
langui&s;hing Circum&s;tances of the Trade, as
the Cau&s;e; then they will come up to Par|liament
convinc'd of your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
fully prepar'd to receive your Petitions, and
fill'd with Compa&s;&s;ionate Thoughts for your
Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t con&s;e&s;s, this &s;eems to me to be the
mo&s;t proper Method, to &s;pirit the approach|ing
<PB N="41" REF="40">
A&s;&s;embly of Parliament with Sentiments
of Pity for their County, and with a ju&s;t
Knowledge of the Reallity of, and Rea&s;on
for the Complaints you make; and if I
might be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e
Sheets &s;hall any where come to the Hands of
the particular Members in the Manufactur|ing
Counties and Corporations for which
they &s;erve, I would, with all po&s;&s;ible Hu|mility,
but al&s;o with the utmo&s;t Importuni|ty,
petition them to look a little into the
State of the Manufactures in their re&s;pective
Countries where they live.</P>
<P>It is without doubt, the ju&s;t Concern, of
our Repre&s;entatives, to &s;tudy the Intere&s;t
and the Circum&s;tances of the People who
they repre&s;ent. If the&s;e Gentlemen plea&s;e
but to look round them, they mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
&s;ee that the Manufactures decline,
that Trade langui&s;hes, and the Poor &s;tretch
our their Hands to them for Help. They
mu&s;t needs al&s;o &s;ee the Cau&s;es of it, even at
<PB N="42" REF="41">
their own Doors, while they cannot but &s;ee
a wilfully-po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Nation, dre&s;s'd up in the
Manufactures of Foreigners, and de&s;pi&s;ing
the Workman&s;hip of their own People:
Madly &s;ending their Money to <HI>India</HI> and
<HI>China,</HI> to feed and &s;upport Heathens and
Savages; and neglecting, nay, I may &s;ay,
Rejecting the Manufactures of their own
Country, tho' they &s;ee the poor Families
&s;tarving for want of Work.</P>
<P>I pre&s;s the People in the Countries to lay
open their Ca&s;e before their Repre&s;entatives
and convince them of the melancholly Cir|cum&s;tances
they are in, by the Decay of
Trade, and the Stop of their Manufactures;
and give them a clear View of the Nature
of the Grievance, and whence it proceeds;
and there is no room to doubt, but the
Members would be affected with it, as well
as other Men.</P>
<P>'Tis from the &s;ame Principle, that I move
<PB N="43" REF="42">
the Gentlemen them&s;elves to enquire into
the Ca&s;e, and make them&s;elves fully Ma&s;ters
of both the Fact and the Rea&s;on of it: Af|ter
which, I would not &s;uffer it to be nam'd
as a Doubt, but that the natural Concern
every Member of Parliament mu&s;t have for
the Pro&s;perity of the People he repre&s;ents,
will move him effectually to apply him&s;elf
in Parliament to the Remedy.</P>
<P>'Tis a great Mi&s;take to &s;ugge&s;t, that <HI>Spit|tle-Fields</HI>
alone Complains, or has cau&s;e to
Complain; tho', as I &s;aid before, the Manu|facturers
there feel the Burthen &s;ooner; but
all the Country, and almo&s;t all the Branches
of the Woollen and Silk Manufactures feel it:
And 'tis ea&s;y to &s;hew, why the Town Work|men
feel the &s;top of Trade &s;ooner than the
Country Workmen. The Ca&s;e is this:</P>
<P>The Clothiers, and Drugget or Stuff-ma|kers
in the Country, who are the head Ma|nagers
of the Woollen Manufactures, are
<PB N="44" REF="43">
generally Men of Sub&s;tance and good Stocks;
they have often whole Towns and Villages
employ'd in their particular Works; and tho'
they do feel a &s;top of the Trade at Markets,
they do not &s;o immediately put a &s;top to
their works, but they mu&s;t keep their Markets
and make their Circuits, to take in the Yarn,
and put out the Wool, or their Neighbours
will break in upon them, their Spinners will
&s;eek Work in other Hands, and, perhaps, not
be gotten again when they may want them.</P>
<P>Thus they go on a great while, tho' the
Goods, when made, do not &s;ell, 'till <HI>Black|well-Hall</HI>
lies piled up to the Roof with
Goods, and the Whole&s;ale-Men and Factors
Ware-Hou&s;es are throng'd with them; nay,
even then they go on, and are forc'd to draw
upon the Factors and Whole&s;ale Dealers for
the Money, whether the Goods &s;ell, or no:
The Factors again are &s;ometimes forced to
&s;ell them to Mony'd-Men under the Price,
and perhaps to Lo&s;s; nay, and even &s;ome|times
to pawn or pledge them for Money,
<PB N="45" REF="44">
in hopes of a Market to come; and &s;till with
the Money an&s;wer'd by tho&s;e Bills, the Clo|thier
in the Country goes on, as long as he
can get Credit for a Bag of Wool to Work,
or a Penny of Money to pay his VVorkmen:
And this cau&s;es the Country Poor not to
feel the Check and Decays of their Trade &s;o
&s;oon as the Town Workmen. But then we
mu&s;t take this with us, as we go, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
when the Trade droops &s;o long together,
and the Country Manufacturer or Clothier
is forced to &s;top, 'tis more fatal to the Poor,
<HI>as above</HI>; for then as they are long before
they &s;top, &s;o they are longer before they
recover, and the Poor are, as it were, en|tirely
de&s;titute for a great while.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> the Ca&s;e alters; here
the Manufacturers, I mean, the Ma&s;ters, are
near the Market: They do not put out the
Wool to Spinning, but generally buy it in
the Yarn: As &s;oon is the Market &s;tops, they
&s;top; if they cannot &s;ell their Work, they
immediately knock off their Looms, and the
<PB N="46" REF="45">
Journeymen as immediately &s;tarve and want
Work. Thus as Di&s;tempers near the Heart,
or in the Vital Parts, are &s;ooner and more
&s;en&s;ibly felt, than in the le&s;s Noble Parts of
the Body; &s;o the Di&s;ea&s;e, of Trade, the
Decay and Stop of Sale, is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly
and &s;ooner felt here, than in the Country,
and therefore Here the Complaint is fir&s;t
made, and loude&s;t.</P>
<P>But this on the other hand, te&s;tifies
to us, that if it be not provided for forwith,
if &s;ome pre&s;ent Remedy be not apply'd to it,
the &s;preading malignity will &s;oon extend it
&s;elf, and the mo&s;t extream Part will then
feel it: And what's the Con&s;equence? but
that then the Complaint will come up louder
and be more unea&s;y to us.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things urge us, if po&s;&s;ible, to
apply &s;ome &s;peedy, &s;ome immediate Reme|dy
to the Evil. What that Remedy is, and
what alone can cure us, I refer to the Sea|&s;on
<PB N="47" REF="46">
of it; the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is to lay down
the Fundamental, (<HI>viz.</HI>) &s;hew the Di&s;ea&s;e,
awaken the Nation, open their Eyes to the
Con&s;equences of it, and guide them in their
Applications to the proper Per&s;ons, who a|lone
can take it in hand, and that is, <HI>as a|bove,</HI>
the Parliament.</P>
<P>Certainly if the Members of Parliament
in the &s;everal Countries would but enquire
a little into the Particulars, now they are at
lei&s;ure, they would come up big with a De|&s;ire
to &s;et their helping hand to it; they
would come up fill'd with Re&s;entment at
tho&s;e who have been In&s;truments to ruin the
flouri&s;hing Trade of their Country and noth|ing
could influence them again&s;t the humble
propo&s;als that may be made to them for re|&s;toring
the Trade and Pro&s;perity of the King|dom.</P>
<P>It
is &s;ugge&s;ted, that all Applications of
this King will meet with a powerfull Oppo|&s;ition,
<PB N="48" REF="47">
and that the Manufacturers, however
numerous they are, will not find Friends
enough to carry their Point again&s;t the
Wearing and U&s;ing the Printed Callicoes.</P>
<P>For my part, I cannot be of this Opinion:
It is true, I have not <HI>told No&s;es,</HI> as they call
it, or ca&s;t up the Strength on either &s;ide, or
examin'd who &s;hall be the Friends, or who
the Enemnies of the VVeavers Petitions; but
this I venture to &s;ay, that as I have prov'd
the Grievance is National, this, I think
will follow, that none of the Nation's
Friends can be Enemies to the Propo&s;als for
a Remedy. It is our Satisfaction that this is
no Party Cau&s;e, unle&s;s any one &s;hould vilely
in&s;inuate, that there is a Party that would
not have the Manufactures thrive, or would
have the Poor &s;tarv'd and peri&s;h; and I can|not
have &s;uch ill Notions of any Man as to
think Party can carry them that length;
Trade is a perfect Neuter in all our unhappy
Strife: Spinning and Weaving are neither
<PB N="49" REF="48">
<HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory,</HI> but the great Articles by
which we live, by which the con&s;umption
of our Produce is carry'd on, and by which
the Poor are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, who without it,
would, in a word, eat us up all.</P>
<P>If this Cau&s;e Meets with Enemies; if any
one Man can be found in <HI>Britan,</HI> who
would not have us leave off Painted Feathers,
and &s;tick to our own Manufactures; I &s;ay
if one Man can be found &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, it
mu&s;t be either a Man perfectly ignorant in
Matters of Trade, and &s;o not worth talking
to; or it mu&s;t be &s;ome Callicoe Printer, or
his Employer and Dependant, who, find|ing
his Account in the Mi&s;chief, acts upon
the corrupt Principle of being willing to get
Money tho' at the Expence of the Ruin of
his Country; &s;omething like the wretched
Sexton of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> in the Year 1665,
who, being employ'd at the <HI>Pe&s;t-bou&s;e</HI> near
<HI>Old-&s;treet,</HI> would have had the <HI>Plague</HI> con|tinue,
<PB N="50" REF="49">
that his Fees might not abate, but that
he might have People enough to Bury.</P>
<P>But let us not fright our &s;elves with the
imaginary Notion of Enemies, and a &s;trong
Oppo&s;ition: <HI>Nil De&s;perandum,</HI> let us take
but true Mea&s;ures, &s;etting the Fact in a clear
light, and convincing our Repre&s;entatives,
in a peaceable but effectual manner, of the
Weight of the Ca&s;e, and how ju&s;tly they
are concern'd, as Repre&s;entatives, to e&s;pou&s;e
the Trading Intere&s;t of their Country; I
can never imagine, that any Cabals of Dra|pers,
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>-Men, Brokers, and Job|bers
&s;hall be able to bya&s;s the Members of a
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament again&s;t it, or to blind
their Eyes in a Ca&s;e &s;o clear as this, that
wearing a foreign Manufacture, and de&s;pi|&s;ing
our own, is the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous, tho'
the mo&s;t certain Method of &s;traving us all,
that can po&s;&s;ibly be invented.</P>
