<HEAD>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reign of Queen ANNE,
(which notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e
happy Times which &s;ucceeded,
every Engli&s;hman may remem|ber)
thou may'&s;t po&s;&s;ibly, gentle
Reader, have &s;een a certain Ve|nerable
Per&s;on who frequented
the Out&s;ide of the Palace of St.
James's, and who by the Gravity
of his Deportment and Habit,
was generally taken for a decay'd
Gentleman of Spain. His &s;tature
was tall, his vi&s;age long, his
complexion olive, his brows were
<PB N="2" REF="3">
black and even, his eyes hollow
yet piercing, his no&s;e inclin'd to
Aquiline, his beard neglected and
mix'd with grey: All this con|tributed
to &s;pread a &s;olemn Me|lancholy
over his countenance.
Pythagoras was not more &s;ilent,
Pyrrho more motionle&s;s, nor
Zeno more au&s;tere. His Wig
was as black and &s;mooth as the
plumes of a Raven, and hung
as &s;trait as the hair of a River-God
ri&s;ing from the water. His
Cloak &s;o compleatly covered his
whole per&s;on, that whether or
no he had any other cloaths
(much le&s;s any linnen) under it,
I &s;hall not &s;ay; but his &s;word
appear'd a full yard behind him,
and his manner of wearing it
was &s;o &s;tiff, that it &s;eem'd grown
to his Thigh. his whole figure
<PB N="3" REF="4">
was &s;o utterly unlike any thing of
this world, that it was not na|tural
for any man to ask him a
que&s;tion without ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
fir&s;t, Tho&s;e who never &s;aw a
<HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> took him for one, and
others believed him &s;ome <HI>High
Prie&s;t of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But under this macerated form
was conceal'd a Mind replete
with Science, burning with a
Zeal of benefiting his fellow|creatures,
and filled with an
hone&s;t con&s;cious Pride, mix'd
with a &s;corn of doing or &s;uffering
the lea&s;t thing beneath the dig|nity
of a Philo&s;opher. Accord|ingly
he had a &s;oul that would
not let him accept of any offers
of Charity, at the &s;ame time
that his body &s;eem'd but too
much to require it. His lodging
<PB N="4" REF="5">
was in a &s;mall chamber up four
pair of &s;tairs, where he regularly
payed for what he had when he
eat or drank, and he was often
ob&s;erved wholly to ab&s;tain from
both. He declin'd &s;peaking to
any one, except the Queen, or
her fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, to whom he
attempted to make &s;ome appli|cations;
but his real bu&s;ine&s;s or
intentions were utterly unknown
to all men. Thus much is cer|tain,
that he was obnoxious to
the Queen's Mini&s;try; who either
out of Jealou&s;y or Envy, had
him &s;pirited away, and carried
abroad as a dangerous per&s;on,
without any regard to the known
Laws of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>One day, as this Gentleman
was walking about dinner-time
alone in the Mall, it happen'd
<PB N="5" REF="6">
that a Manu&s;cript dropt from
under his cloak, which my &s;er|vant
pick'd up, and brought to
me. It was written in the Latin
tongue, and contain'd many
mo&s;t profound Secrets, in an
unu&s;ual turn of rea&s;oning and
&s;tyle. The fir&s;t leaf was in&s;cri|bed
with the&s;e words, <HI>Codicillus,
&s;e&uacute; Liber Memorialis, Martini
Scribleri.</HI> The Book was of &s;o
wonderful a nature, that it is in|credible
what a de&s;ire I conceiv'd
that moment to be acquainted
with the Author, who I clearly
perceiv'd was &s;ome great Philo&s;o|pher
in di&s;gui&s;e. I &s;everal times
endeavour'd to &s;peak to him,
which he as often indu&s;triou&s;ly
avoided. At length I found an
opportunity (as he &s;tood under
the Piazza by the Dancing-room
<PB N="6" REF="7">
in St. James's) to acquaint him
in the Latin tongue, that his
Manu&s;cript was fallen into my
hands: and &s;aying this, I pre|&s;ented
it to him, with great En|comiums
on the learned Author.
Hereupon he took me a&s;ide,
&s;urvey'd me over with a fix'd
attention, and opening the cla&s;ps
of the Parchment cover, &s;poke
(to my great &s;urprize) in Engli&s;h,
as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">" Courteous &s;tranger, who|ever
thou art, I embrace thee
as my be&s;t friend; for either
the Stars and my Art are de|ceitful,
or the de&s;tin'd time
is come which is to manife&s;t
Martinus Scriblerus to the
world, and thou the per&s;on
cho&s;en by fate for this task.
What thou &s;ee&s;t in me is a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
body exhau&s;ted by the labours
of the mind. I have found
in Dame Nature not indeed an
unkind, but a very coy Mi&s;|tre&s;s:
Watchful nights, anxi|ous
days, &s;lender meals, and
endle&s;s labours, mu&s;t be the
lot of all who pur&s;ue her,
through her labyrinths and
meanders. My fir&s;t vital air
I drew in this I&s;land (a &s;oil
fruitful of Philo&s;ophers) but
my complexion is become
adu&s;t, and my body arid, by
vi&s;iting lands (as the Poet has
it) <HI>alio &s;ub &s;ole calentes.</HI> I
have, through my whole life,
pa&s;&s;ed under &s;everal di&s;gui&s;es
and unknown names, to &s;kreen
my &s;elf from the envy and
malice which mankind ex|pre&s;s
again&s;t tho&s;e who are
<PB N="8" REF="9">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Arcanum
Magnum.</HI> But at pre&s;ent I
am forc'd to take Sanctuary
in the Briti&s;h Court, to avoid
the Revenge of a cruel Spa|niard
who has pur&s;ued me al|mo&s;t
through the whole ter|raqueous
globe. Being about
four years ago in the City of
Madrid in que&s;t of natural
knowledge, I was informed
of a Lady who was marked
with a Pomegranate upon the
in&s;ide of her right Thigh,
which blo&s;&s;om'd, and, as it
were, &s;eem'd to ripen in the
due &s;ea&s;on. Forthwith was
I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an in&s;atiable
curio&s;ity to view this wonder|ful
Phaenomenon. I felt the
ardour of my pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;e
as the &s;ea&s;on advanced, till in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
the month of July I could no
longer contain. I bribed her
Duenna, was admitted to the
Bath, &s;aw her undre&s;s'd, and
the wonder di&s;play'd. This
was &s;oon after di&s;covered by
the hu&s;band, who finding
&s;ome letters I had writ to the
Duenna, containing expre&s;|&s;ions
of a doubtful meaning,
&s;u&s;pected me of a crime mo&s;t
alien from the Purity of my
Thoughts. Incontinently I
left Madrid by the advice of
friends, have been pur&s;ued,
dogg'd, and way-laid through
&s;everal Nations, and even now
&s;carce think my &s;elf &s;ecure
within the &s;acred walls of this
Palace. It has been my good
fortune to have &s;een all the
grand Phaenomena of Nature,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
excepting an Earthquake, which
I waited for in Naples three
years in vain; and now by
means of &s;ome Briti&s;h Ship
(who&s;e Colours no Spaniard
dares approach) I impatiently
expect, a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to Ja|maica,
for that benefit. To
thee my Friend, whom Fate
has marked for my Hi&s;torio|grapher,
I leave the&s;e my
Commentaries, and others of
my works, No more&mdash;be
faithful and impartial."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;oon after performed his
promi&s;e, and left me the Com|mentaries,
giving me al&s;o further
lights by many Conferences; when
he was unfortunately &s;natch'd
away (as I before related) by the
jealou&s;y of the Queen's Mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Tho' I was thus to my eternal
grief depriv'd of his conver&s;ation,
he for &s;ome years continued his
Corre&s;pondence, and communi|cated
to me many of his Projects
for the benefit of mankind. He
&s;ent me &s;ome of his Writings, and
recommended to my care the
recovery of others, &s;traggling a|bout
the world, and a&s;&s;umed by
other men. The la&s;t time I heard
from him was on occa&s;ion of his
Strictures on the Dunciad: &s;ince
when, &s;everal years being elaps'd,
I have rea&s;on to believe this ex|cellent
Per&s;on is either dead, or
carry'd by his vehement thir&s;t of
knowledge into &s;ome remote, or
perhaps undi&s;cover'd Region of
the world. In either ca&s;e, I think
it a debt no longer to be delay'd,
to reveal what I know of this
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Prodigy of Science, and to give
the Hi&s;tory of his life, and of his
exten&s;ive merits to mankind; in
which I dare promi&s;e the Reader,
that whenever he begins to think
any one Chapter dull, the &s;tyle
will be immediately changed in
the next.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Parentage and Family of <HI>Scrible|rus,</HI>
how he was begot, what Care was
taken of him before he was born, and
what Prodigies attended his Birth.</HEAD>
<P>IN the City of Mun&s;ter in Germany,
lived a grave and learned Gentle|man,
by Profe&s;&s;ion an Antiquary; who
among all his invaluable Curio&s;ities,
e&s;teemed none more highly, than a Skin
of the true Pergamenian Parchment,
which hung at the upper-end of his
hall. On this was curiou&s;ly traced the
ancient Pedigree of the <HI>Scribleri,</HI> with
all their Alliances and collateral Relati|ons
<PB N="2" REF="15">
(among which were reckon'd Alber|tus
Magnus, Paracel&s;us Bomba&s;tus, and
the famous Scaligers in old time Princes
of Verona) and deduced even from the
Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius
Scriblerus: For &s;uch was the name of
this venerable Per&s;onage; who&s;e glory
it was, that by the &s;ingular Virtue of
the Women, not one had a Head of a
different Ca&s;t from his family.</P>
<P>His wife was a Lady of &s;ingular
beauty, whom not for that rea&s;on only
he e&s;pou&s;ed, but becau&s;e &s;he was un|doubted
daughter either of the great
Scriverius, or of Ga&s;par Barthius. It
happen'd on a time, the &s;aid Ga&s;par
made a vi&s;it to Scriverius at Harlem,
taking with him a comely Lady of his
acquaintance who was &s;kilful in the
Greek Tongue, of whom the learned
Scriverius became &s;o enamour'd, as to
inebriate his friend, and be familiar
with his Mi&s;tre&s;s. I am not ignorant
of what  <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colume&s;ius relates this from I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius, in his Opu&s;cul. p. 102.</NOTE>Colume&s;ius affirms, that the
<PB N="3" REF="16">
learned Barthius was not &s;o overtaken
but he perceiv'd it; and in Revenge
&s;uffer'd this unfortunate Gentlewoman
to be drowned in the Rhine at her re|turn.
But Mrs. Scriblerus (the i&s;&s;ue
of that Amour) was a living proof of
the fal&s;ehood of this Report. Dr. Cor|nelius
was further induced to his mar|riage,
from the certain information that
the afore&s;aid Lady, the mother of his
wife, was related to Cardan on the fa|ther's
&s;ide, and to Aldrovandus on the
mother's: Be&s;ides which, her Ance&s;|tors
had been profe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ick,
A&s;trology, or Chymi&s;try, in German
Univer&s;ities, from generation to gene|ration.</P>
<P>With this fair Gentlewoman had our
Doctor lived in a comfortable Union
for about ten years: But this our &s;ober
and orderly pair, without any natural
infirmity, and with a con&s;tant and fre|quent
compliance to the chief duty of
conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that
Heaven had not ble&s;&s;ed them with any
i&s;&s;ue. This was the utmo&s;t grief to
the good man; e&s;pecially con&s;idering
<PB N="4" REF="17">
what exact Precautions and Methods
he had u&s;ed to procure that Ble&s;&s;ing:
for he never had cohabitation with his
&s;pou&s;e, but he ponder'd on the Rules of
the Ancients, for the generation of
Children of Wit. He ordered his diet
according to the pre&s;cription of Galen,
confining him&s;elf and his wife for al|mo&s;t
the whole fir&s;t year to  <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Galen Lib. de Cibis boni &amp; mali &s;ucci. cap. 3.</NOTE>Goat's
Milk and Honey. It unfortunately
befel her, when &s;he was about four
months gone with child, to long for
&s;omewhat which that author inveighs
again&s;t, as prejudicial to the under&s;tand|ing
of the Infant: This her hu&s;band
thought fit to deny her, affirming, it
was better to be childle&s;s, than to be|come
the Parent of a Fool. His Wife
mi&s;carried; but as the Abortion proved
only a female Faetus, he comforted
him&s;elf, that had it arrived to perfecti|on,
it would not have an&s;wer'd his ac|count;
his heart being wholly fixed
upon the learned Sex. However he
<PB N="5" REF="18">
di&s;dained not to trea&s;ure up the Em|bryo
in a Vial, among the curio&s;ities of
his family.</P>
<P>Having di&s;covered that Galen's pre|&s;cription
could not determine the &s;ex,
he forthwith betook him&s;elf to Ari|&s;totle.
Accordingly he with-held the
nuptial embrace when the wind was
in any point of the South; this <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. 14. Sect. Prob. 5.</NOTE> Au|thor
a&s;&s;erting that the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and
moi&s;ture of the &s;outherly winds occa&s;i|on
the procreation of females, and not
of males. But he redoubled his dili|gence
when the wind was at We&s;t, a
wind on which that great Philo&s;opher
be&s;towed the Encomiums of Fatner of
the earth, Breath of the Ely&s;ian Fields,
and other glorious Elogies. For our
learned man was clearly of opinion, that
the Semina out of which Animals are
produced, are Animalcula ready form|ed,
and received in with the Air.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Religion of Nature, Sect. 5. Parag. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>Under the&s;e regulations, his wife, to
his unexpre&s;&s;ible joy, grew pregnant a
<PB N="6" REF="19">
&s;econd time; and, (what was no &s;mall
addition to his happine&s;s) he ju&s;t then
came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable
E&s;tate by the death of her Uncle, a
wealthy Jew who re&s;ided at London.
This made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to take
a journey to England; nor would the
care of his po&s;terity let him &s;uffer his
Wife to remain behind him. During
the voyage, he was perpetually taken
up on the one hand, how to employ his
great Riches; and on the other, how
to educate his Child. He had already
determin'd to &s;et apart &s;everal annual
Sums, for the recovery of <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI>
the effo&s;&s;on of <HI>Coins,</HI> the procuring of
<HI>Mummies</HI>; and for all tho&s;e curious di&s;|coveries
by which he hoped to become
(as him&s;elf was wont to &s;ay) a &s;econd
<HI>Peire&s;kius.</HI> He had already chalked
out all po&s;&s;ible &s;chemes for the improve|ment
of a male child, yet was &s;o far
prepar'd for the wor&s;t that could hap|pen,
that before the nine months were
expired, he had compo&s;ed two Trea|ti&s;es
of Education; the one he called
<PB N="7" REF="20">
<HI>A Daughter's Mirrour,</HI> and the other
<HI>A Son's Monitor.</HI></P>
<P>This is all we can find relating to
Martinus, while he was in his Mother's
womb, excepting that he was enter|tained
there with a Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick
once in twenty four hours, according to
the Cu&s;tom of the Magi: and that on
a <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ram&s;ey's Cyrus.</NOTE> particular day, he was ob&s;erved to
leap and kick exceedingly, which was
on the fir&s;t of April, the birth-day of
the great <HI>Ba&s;ilius Valentinus.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this, and every pre|ceding
Fact, may be depended upon,
being taken literally from the Memoirs.
But I mu&s;t be &s;o ingenuous as to own,
that the Accounts are not &s;o certain of
the exact time and place of his birth.
As to the fir&s;t, he had the common
frailty of old men, to conceal his age:
as to the &s;econd, I only remember to
have heard him &s;ay, that he fir&s;t &s;aw
the light in St. Giles's Pari&s;h. But in
the inve&s;tigation of this point, Fortune
hath favoured our diligence. For one
<PB N="8" REF="21">
day as I was pa&s;&s;ing by the <HI>Seven Dials,</HI>
I overheard a di&s;pute concerning the
place of Nativity of a great A&s;trologer,
which each man alledged to have been
in his own &s;treet. The circum&s;tances
of the time, and the de&s;cription of the
per&s;on, made me imagine it might be
that univer&s;al Genius who&s;e life I am
writing. I returned home, and having
maturely con&s;idered their &s;everal argu|ments,
which I found to be of equal
weight, I quieted my curio&s;ity with
this natural conclu&s;ion, that he was born
in &s;ome point common to all the &s;even
&s;treets; which mu&s;t be that on which
the Column is now erected. And it is
with infinite plea&s;ure that I &s;ince find
my Conjecture confirmed, by the fol|lowing
pa&s;&s;age in the Codicil to Mr.
Neale's Will.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>I appoint my Executors to engrave the
following In&s;cription on the Column in the
Center of the &s;even Streets which I erec|ted.</HI> <Q>LOC. NAT. INCLUT. PHI|LOS.

<PB N="9" REF="22">
But Mr. Neale's Order was never per|formed,
becau&s;e the Executors dur&s;t
not admini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Nor was the Birth of this great man
unattended with Prodigies: He him|&s;elf
has often told me, that on the night
before he was born, Mrs. Scriblerus
dream'd &s;he was brought to bed of a
huge <HI>Ink-horn,</HI> out of which i&s;&s;ued
&s;everal large &s;treams of Ink, as it had
been a fountain. This dream was by
her hu&s;band thought to &s;ignify, that the
child &s;hould prove a very voluminous
Writer. Likewi&s;e a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virgil's Laurel Donat.</NOTE><HI>Crab-tree</HI> that
had been hitherto barren, appeared on
a &s;udden laden with a va&s;t quantity of
Crabs: This &s;ign al&s;o the old gentle|man
imagined to be a progno&s;tic of the
acutene&s;s of his Wit. A great &s;warm
of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plato, Lucan, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Wa&s;ps</HI> play'd round his Cradle
without hurting him, but were very
trouble&s;ome to all in the room be&s;ides:
This &s;eemed a certain pre&s;age of the ef|fects
of his Satire. A Dunghill was
<PB N="10" REF="23">
&s;een within the &s;pace of one night to be
covered all over with <HI>Mu&s;hroom:</HI> This
&s;ome interpreted to promi&s;e the infant
great fertility of fancy, but no long
duration to his works: but the Father
was of another opinion.</P>
<P>But what was of all mo&s;t wonderful,
was a thing that &s;eemed a mon&s;trous
<HI>Fowl,</HI> which ju&s;t then dropt through
the &s;ky-light, near his wife's apartment.
It had a large body, two little di&s;pro|portioned
wings, a prodigious tail, but
no head. As its colour was white, he
took it at fir&s;t &s;ight for a Swan, and
was concluding his &s;on would be a
Poet: but on a nearer view, he pre|ceived
it to be &s;peckled with black, in
the form of letters; and that it was in|deed
a Paper kite which had broke its
lea&s;h by the impetuo&s;ity of the wind.
His back was armed with the Art
Military, his belly was filled with Phy|&s;ick,
his wings were the wings of Quarles
and Withers, the &s;everal Nodes of his
voluminous tail were diver&s;ify'd with
&s;everal branches of Science; where the
Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of
<PB N="11" REF="24">
Logick, a knot of Metaphy&s;ick, a knot
of Ca&s;ui&s;try, a knot of Polemical Divi|nity,
and a knot of Common Law, with
a <HI>Lanthorn</HI> of <HI>Jacob Behmen.</HI></P>
<P>There went a Report in the family,
that as &s;oon as he was born he uttered
the voice of nine &s;everal animals: he
cry'd like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep,
chattered like a Mag-pye, grunted like
a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked
like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gab|bled
like a Goo&s;e, and bray'd like an
A&s;s. And the next morning he was
found playing in his bed with two
Owls, which came down the chimney.
His Father greatly rejoyced at all the&s;e
&s;igns, which betokened the variety of
his Eloquence, and the extent of his
Learning; but he was more particu|larly
plea&s;ed with the la&s;t, as it nearly
re&s;embled what happen'd at the birth
of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Eu&s;tat. in Ody&s;&s;. l. 12. ex Alex. Pa|phio. &amp; Leo. Allat. de patr. Hom. pag. 45.</NOTE>Homer.</P>

<P>NO &s;ooner was the cry of the In|fant
heard, but the old gentle|man
ru&s;hed into the Room, and &s;natch|ing
it in his arms, examin'd every limb
with attention. He was infinitely
pleas'd to find, that the Child had the
Wart of Cicero, the wry Neck of Alex|ander,
knots upon his legs like Marius,
and one of them &s;horter than the other
like Age&s;ilaus. The good Cornelius
al&s;o hoped he would come to &s;tammer

the child &s;o long, that the Midwife
grown out of all patience, &s;natch'd it
from his arms, in order to &s;waddle it.

free-born? If you have no regard to
his natural Liberty, at lea&s;t have &s;ome

with what agility he &s;preadeth his

Cornelius broke out in this manner.

<HEAD>Shewing what befel the Doctor's Son
and his Shield, on the Day of the
Chri&s;t'ning.</HEAD>
<P>THE day of the Chri&s;t'ning be|ing
come, and the hou&s;e filled
with Go&s;&s;ips, the Levity of who&s;e Con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="17" REF="30">
&s;uited but ill with the Gra|vity
of Dr. Cornelius, he ca&s;t about
how to pa&s;s this day more agreeably
to his Character; that is to &s;ay, not
without &s;ome <HI>Profitable Conference,</HI> nor
wholly without ob&s;ervance of &s;ome
<HI>Ancient Cu&s;tom.</HI></P>
<P>He remembred to have read in The|ocritus,
that the Cradle of Hercules was
a Shield; and being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an an|tique
<HI>Buckler</HI> which he held as a mo&s;t
ine&s;timable Relick, he determined to
have the infant laid therein, and in
that manner brought into the Study,
to be &s;hown to certain learned men of
his acquaintance.</P>
<P>The regard he had for this Shield,
had cau&s;ed him formerly to compile a
Di&s;&s;ertation concerning it, proving
from the &s;everal properties, and parti|cularly
the colour of the Ru&s;t, the ex|act
chronology thereof.</P>
<P>With this Treati&s;e, and a moderate
&s;upper, he propo&s;ed to entertain his
Gue&s;ts; tho' he had al&s;o another de|&s;ign,
to have their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the cal|culation
of his Son's <HI>Nativity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="31">
He therefore took the Buckler out
of a Ca&s;e (in which he always kept it
lea&s;t it might contract any modern
ru&s;t), and entru&s;ted it to his Hou&s;e|maid,
with orders, that when the com|pany
was come &s;he &s;hould lay the
Child carefully in it, cover'd with a
mantle of blue Sattin.</P>
<P>The Gue&s;ts were no &s;ooner &s;eated,
but they entered into a warm Debate
about the <HI>Triclinium</HI> and the manner
of <HI>Decubitus</HI> of the Ancients, which
Cornelius broke off in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>This day, my Friends, I purpo&s;e to ex|hibit
my &s;on before you; a Child not
wholly unworthy of In&s;pection, as he is
de&s;cended from a Race of Virtuo&s;i. Let
the Phi&s;iognomi&s;ts examine his features;
let the Chirographi&s;ts behold his Palm;
but above all let us con&s;ult for the cal|culation
of his Nativity. To this end,
as the child is not vulgar, I will not pre|&s;ent
him unto you in a vulgar manner.
He &s;hall be cradled in my Ancient Shield,
&s;o famous through the Univer&s;ities of
Europe. You all know how I purchas'd
that invaluable piece of Antiquity at the</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="32">
<HI>great (though indeed inadequate) expence
of all the Plate of our family, how hap|pily
I carry'd it off, and how trium|phantly
I tran&s;ported it hither, to the
inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of all Germany. Hap|py
in every circum&s;tance, but that it broke
the heart of the great Melchior In&s;ipi|dus!</HI></P>
<P>Here he &s;topp'd his Speech, upon
&s;ight of the Maid, who enter'd the
room with the Child: He took it in
his arms and proceeded:</P>
<P><HI>Behold then my Child, but fir&s;t behold
the Shield: Behold this Ru&s;t,&mdash;or
rather let me call it this precious Aerugo,&mdash;behold
this beautiful Varni&s;h of
Time,&mdash;this venerable Verdure of
&s;o many Ages&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking the&s;e words, he &s;lowly
lifted up the Mantle, which cover'd it,
inch by inch; but at every inch he un|covered,
his cheeks grew paler, his hand
trembled, his nerves failed, till on &s;ight
of the whole the Tremor became uni|ver&s;al:
The Shield and the Infant both
dropt to the ground, and he had only
<PB N="20" REF="33">
&s;trength enough to cry out, <HI>O God!
my Shield, my Shield!</HI></P>
<P>The Truth was, the Maid (extream|ly
concern'd for the reputation of her
own cleanline&s;s, and her young ma&s;ter's
honour) had &s;coured it as clean as her
Andirons.</P>
<P>Cornelius &s;unk back on a chair, the
Gue&s;ts &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, the infant
&s;quawl'd, the maid ran in, &s;natch'd it
up again in her arms, flew into her mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es
room, and told what had hap|pen'd.
Down &s;tairs in an in&s;tant hur|ried
all the Go&s;&s;ips, where they found
the Doctor in a Trance: Hungary wa|ter,
Hart&s;horn, and the confus'd noi&s;e
of &s;hrill voices, at length awaken'd
him: when opening his eyes, he &s;aw
the Shield in the hands of the Hou&s;e|maid.
<HI>O Woman! Woman! he cry'd
(and &s;natch'd it violently from her) was
it to thy ignorance that this Relick owes
its ruin? where, where is the beautiful
Cru&s;t that cover'd thee &s;o long? where
tho&s;e Traces of Time, and</HI> Fingers <HI>as it
were of Antiquity? Where all tho&s;e beau|tiful

non bene relicta Parmula.</P>
<P>The Go&s;&s;ips, not at all inquiring in|to
the cau&s;e of his &s;orrow, only a&s;ked
if the Child had no hurt? and cry'd,
<HI>Come, come, all is well; what has the
woman done but her duty? a tight clean|ly
wench I warrant her; what a &s;tir a

declar'd their A&s;&s;ent to this latter opi|nion;
and de&s;ir'd Cornelius to be com|forted,
a&s;&s;uring him it was a <HI>Sconce</HI> and
no other. But this, in&s;tead of com|forting,
threw the Doctor into &s;uch a

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Suction and Nutrition of the
Great <HI>Scriblerus</HI> in his Infancy, and
of the fir&s;t Rudiments of his Learn|ing.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Cornelius awaked, he
rais'd him&s;elf on his elbow, and
ca&s;ting his eye on Mrs. Scriblerus,
&s;poke as follows. <HI>Wi&s;ely was it &s;aid
by Homer, that in the Cellar of Jupiter
are two barrels, the one of good, the other</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="36"><HI>of evil, which he never be&s;tows on mortals
&s;eparately, but con&s;tantly mingles them
together. Thus at the &s;ame time hath
Heav'n ble&s;s'd me with the birth of a
Son, and afflicted me with the &s;couring
of my Shield. Yet let us not repine at
his Di&s;pen&s;ations, who gives and who
takes away; but rather join in prayer,
that the Ru&s;t of Antiquity which he hath
been pleas'd to take from my Shield, may
be added to my Son; and that &s;o much
of it as it is my purpo&s;e he &s;hall contract
in his Education, may never be de&s;troy'd
by any Modern Poli&s;hing.</HI></P>
<P>He cou'd no longer bear the &s;ight
of the Shield, but order'd it &s;hould be
remov'd for ever from his eyes. It
was not long after purchas'd by Dr.
Woodward, who, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Mr. Kemp incru&s;ted it with a new
Ru&s;t, and is the &s;ame whereof a Cut
hath been engraved, and exhibited to
the great Contentation of the learned.</P>
<P>Cornelius now began to regulate the
Suction of his Child. Seldom did there
pa&s;s a day without di&s;putes between
him and the Mother, or the Nur&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="37">
concerning the nature of Aliment.
The poor woman never dined but he
denied her &s;ome di&s;h or other, which
he judg'd prejudicial to her milk. One
day &s;he had a longing de&s;ire to a piece
of beef, and as &s;he &s;tretch'd her hand
towards it, the old gentleman drew it
away, and &s;poke to this effect. <HI>Had'&s;t
thou read the Ancients, O Nur&s;e, thou
would'&s;t prefer the welfare of the Infant
which thou nouri&s;he&s;t, to the indulging
of an irregular and voracious Appetite.
Beef, it is true, may confer a Robu&s;tne&s;s
on the limbs of my &s;on, but will hebetate
and clogg his Intellectuals.</HI> While he
&s;poke this, the Nur&s;e look'd upon him
with much anger, and now and then
ca&s;t a wi&s;hful eye upon the Beef&mdash;<HI>Pa&s;&s;ion (continu'd the Doctor, &s;till hold|ing
the di&s;h) throws the mind into too
violent a fermentation; it is a kind of
Fever of the &s;oul, or, as Horace expre&s;&s;es
it, a</HI> Short Madne&s;s. <HI>Con&s;ider Woman,
that this day's Suction of my &s;on may
cau&s;e him to imbibe many ungovernable
Pa&s;&s;ions, and in a manner &s;poil him for
the temper of a Philo&s;opher. Romulus</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="38"><HI>by &s;ucking a Wolf, became of a fierce and
&s;avage di&s;po&s;ition; and were I to breed

interrupted the Nur&s;e, Beef
&s;poil the under&s;tanding? that's fine in|deed&mdash;how
then could our Par&s;on
preach as he does upon Beef, and Pud|ding
too, if you go to that? Don't tell
me of your Ancients, had not you al|mo&s;t
kill'd the poor babe with a di&s;h
of Daemonial black Broth?&mdash;<HI>Lacede|monian
black Broth, thou would'&s;t &s;ay,
(reply'd Cornelius) but I cannot allow
the &s;urfeit to have been occa&s;ioned by that
diet, &s;ince it was recommended by the
Divine Lycurgus. No, Nur&s;e, thou
mu&s;t certainly have eaten &s;ome meats of
ill dige&s;tion the day before, and that was
the real cau&s;e of his di&s;order. Con&s;ider
Woman, the different Temperaments of
different Nations: What makes the
Engli&s;h Phlegmatick and melancholy but
Beef? what renders the Welch &s;o hot
and cholerick, but chee&s;e and leeks? the
French derive their levity from their</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="39">
<HI>Soups, Frogs, and Mu&s;hrooms: I would
not let my Son dine like an Italian, le&s;t
like an Italian he &s;hould be jealous and
revengeful: The warm and &s;olid diet of
Spain may be more beneficial, as it might
indue him with a profound Gravity, but
at the &s;ame time he might &s;uck in with
their food their intolerable Vice of Pride.
Therefore Nur&s;e, in &s;hort, I hold it re|qui&s;ite
to deny you at pre&s;ent, not only Beef,
but likewi&s;e what&s;oever any of tho&s;e Na|tions
eat.</HI> During this &s;peech, the
Nur&s;e remain'd pouting and marking
her plate with the knife, nor would
&s;he touch a bit during the whole din|ner.
This the old Gentleman ob&s;er|ving,
order'd that the Child, to avoid
the ri&s;que of imbibing ill humours,
&s;hould be kept from her brea&s;t all that
day, and be fed with Butter mix'd
with Honey, according to a Pre&s;cripti|on
he had met with &s;omewhere in
Eu&s;tathius upon Homer. This in|deed
gave the Child a great loo&s;ene&s;s,
but he was not concern'd at it, in the
opinion that whatever harm it might
do his body, would be amply recom|penced
<PB N="27" REF="40">
by the improvements of his un|der&s;tanding.
But from thenceforth
he in&s;i&s;ted every day upon a particular
Diet to be ob&s;erved by the Nur&s;e; un|der
which having been long unea&s;y,
&s;he at la&s;t parted from the family, on
his ordering her for dinner the <HI>Paps</HI> of
a <HI>Sow</HI> with Pig; taking it as the high|e&s;t
indignity, and a direct In&s;ult upon
her Sex and Calling.</P>
<P>Four years of young Martin's life
pa&s;s'd away in &s;quabbles of this nature.
Mrs. Scriblerus con&s;ider'd it was now
time to in&s;truct him in the fundamen|tals
of Religion, and to that end took
no &s;mall pains in teaching him his <HI>Cate|chi&s;m:</HI>
But Cornelius look'd upon this
as a tedious way of In&s;truction, and
therefore employ'd his head to find out
more plea&s;ing methods, the better to
induce him to be fond of learning.
He would frequently carry him to the
<HI>Puppet-&s;how,</HI> of the Creation of the
world, where the Child with exceeding
delight gain'd a notion of the Hi&s;tory
of the Bible. His fir&s;t rudiments in
profane hi&s;tory were acquired by &s;ee|ing
<PB N="28" REF="41">
of <HI>Raree-&s;hows,</HI> where he was
brought acquainted with all the Princes
of Europe. In &s;hort the old Gentle|man
&s;o contriv'd it, to make every
thing contribute to the improvement
of his knowledge, even to his very
Dre&s;s. He invented for him a Geo|graphical
&s;uit of cloaths, which might
give him &s;ome hints of that Science,
and likewi&s;e &s;ome knowledge of the
Commerce of different Nations. He
had a French Hat with an African
Feather, Holland Shirts and Flanders
Lace, Engli&s;h Cloth lin'd with Indian
Silk, his Gloves were Italian, and his
Shoes were Spani&s;h: He was made to
ob&s;erve this, and daily catechis'd there|upon,
which his Father was wont to
call <HI>Travelling at home.</HI> He never
gave him a Fig or an Orange but he
obliged him to give an account from
what Country it came. In Natural
hi&s;tory he was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his
Curio&s;ity in <HI>Sign-Po&s;ts,</HI> in&s;omuch that
he hath often confe&s;s'd he owed to
them the knowledge of many Creatures
which he never found &s;ince in any Au|thor,
<PB N="29" REF="42">
&s;uch as White Lions, Golden
Dragons, &amp;c. He once thought the
&s;ame of Green Men, but had &s;ince
found them mention'd by Kercherus,
and verify'd in the Hi&s;tory of William
of Newbury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubrig. Book i. Ch. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>His di&s;po&s;ition to the Mathematicks
was di&s;cover'd very early, by his draw|ing
 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;cal's Life. Locke of Educ. &amp;c.</NOTE> parallel lines on his bread and

of all the&s;e Improvements, a &s;top was
put to his learning the <HI>Alphabet,</HI> nor
would he let him proceed to Letter D,
till he could truly and di&s;tinctly pro|nounce
C in the ancient manner, at

near three months. He was al&s;o o|blig'd

Cornelius having read, and &s;eriou&s;ly
weigh'd the methods by which the fa|mous

in &s;ome degree to exceed them,
re&s;olv'd he &s;hould &s;peak and learn no|thing
but the learned Languages, and
e&s;pecially the Greek; in which he
con&s;tantly eat and drank, according to
Homer. But what mo&s;t conduced to
his ea&s;y attainment of this Language,
was his love of Ginger-bread; which
his Father ob&s;erving, cau&s;ed it to be
&s;tampt with the Letters of the Greek
Alphabet; and the child the very fir&s;t
day eat as far as Iota. By this parti|cular
application to this language above
the re&s;t, he attain'd &s;o great a profi|cience
therein, that Gronovius inge|nuou&s;ly
confe&s;&s;es he dur&s;t not confer

old; and at fourteen he compo&s;ed a

wi&s;ely contrived by Nature, that

From the &s;ame cau&s;e, and from the

<P>Here I mu&s;t premi&s;e a general ob&s;er|vation
of great benefit to mankind.
<PB N="51" REF="64">
That there are many people who have
the u&s;e only of one Operation of the
Intellect, tho' like &s;hort-&s;ighted men
they can hardly di&s;cover it them&s;elves:
They can form <HI>&s;ingle apprehen&s;ions,</HI> but
have neither of the other two faculties,
the <HI>judicium</HI> or <HI>di&s;cur&s;us.</HI> Now as it
is wi&s;ely order'd, that people depriv'd
of one &s;en&s;e have the others in more
perfection, &s;uch people will form &s;ingle
Ideas with a great deal of vivacity; and
happy were it indeed if they would
confine them&s;elves to &s;uch, without
forming <HI>judicia,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>argumen|tations.</HI></P>
<P>Cornelius quickly di&s;cover'd, that
the&s;e two la&s;t operations of the intel|lect
were very weak in Martin, and al|mo&s;t
totally extingui&s;h'd in Crambe;
however he u&s;ed to &s;ay that Rules of
Logick are Spectacles to a purblind un|der&s;tanding,
and therefore he re&s;olv'd
to proceed with his two Pupils.</P>
<P>Martin's under&s;tanding was &s;o total|ly
immers'd in <HI>&s;en&s;ible objects,</HI> that he
demanded examples from Material
things of the ab&s;tracted Ideas of Lo|gick:
<PB N="52" REF="65">
As for Crambe, he contented
him&s;elf with the Words, and when he
could but form &s;ome conceit upon
them, was fully &s;atisfy'd. Thus Crambe
would tell his In&s;tructor, that All
men were not <HI>&s;ingular</HI>; that Individu|ality
could hardly be praedicated of
any man, for it was commonly &s;aid that
a man <HI>is</HI> not the &s;ame he <HI>was,</HI> that
madmen are <HI>be&s;ide them&s;elves,</HI> and drun|ken
men <HI>come to them&s;elves</HI>; which
&s;hows, that few men have that mo&s;t
valuable logical endowment, Individu|ality.
Cornelius told Martin that a
&s;houlder of mutton was an individual,
which Crambe deny'd, for he had &s;een
it cut into commons: That's true
(quoth the Tutor) but you never &s;aw
it cut into &s;houlders of mutton: If it
could (quoth Crambe) it would be the
mo&s;t lovely individual of the Univer|&s;ity.
When he was told, a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI>
was that which was <HI>&s;ubject to accidents</HI>;
then Soldiers (quoth Crambe) are the
mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial people in the World.
Neither would he allow it to be a good
definition of <HI>accident,</HI> that it could be
<PB N="53" REF="66">
<HI>pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent without the de&s;truction
of the &s;ubject</HI>; &s;ince there are a great
many accidents that de&s;troy the &s;ub|ject,
as burning does a hou&s;e, and death
a man. But as to that, Cornelius in|formed
him, that there was a <HI>natural
death,</HI> and <HI>a logical death</HI>; that though
a man after his natural death was not
capable of the lea&s;t pari&s;h-office, yet
he might &s;till keep his Stall among&s;t
the logical praedicaments.</P>
<P>Cornelius was forc'd to give Martin
&s;en&s;ible images; thus calling up the
Coachman he a&s;k'd him what he had
&s;een at the Bear-garden? the man an|&s;wer'd
he &s;aw two men fight a prize;
one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the
Guards, the other black, a Butcher;
the Sergeant had red breeches, the
Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage
about four o'clock, and the Sergeant
wounded the Butcher in the leg. <HI>Mark
(quoth Cornelius) how the fellow runs
through the praedicaments. Men,</HI> Sub|&s;tantia;
<HI>two,</HI> quantitas; <HI>fair and black,</HI>
qualitas; <HI>Sergeant and Butcher,</HI> relatio;
<HI>wounded the other,</HI> actio &amp; pa&s;&s;io; <HI>fight|ing,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="67">
&s;itus; <HI>Stage,</HI> ubi; <HI>two a Clock,</HI>
quando; <HI>blue and red Breeches,</HI> habitus.
At the &s;ame time he warn'd Martin,
that what he now <HI>learn'd</HI> as a Logician,
he mu&s;t <HI>forget</HI> as a natural Philo&s;opher;
that tho' he now taught them that ac|cidents
inher'd in the &s;ubject, they
would find in time there was no &s;uch
thing; and that colour, ta&s;te, &s;mell,
heat, and cold, were not in the things
but only phanta&s;ms of our brains. He
was forc'd to let them into this &s;ecret,
for Martin could not conceive how a
habit of dancing inher'd in a dancing|ma&s;ter,
when he did not dance; nay,
he would demand the Characteri&s;ticks
of Relations: Crambe us'd to help him
out by telling him, a Cuckold, a lo&s;ing
game&s;ter, a man that had not din'd, a
young heir that was kept &s;hort by his
father, might be all known by their
countenance; that, in this la&s;t ca&s;e,
the Paternity and Filiation leave very
&s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>relatum</HI> and
<HI>correlatum.</HI> The greate&s;t difficulty was,
when they came to the Tenth Praedi|cament:
Crambe affirmed, that his
<PB N="55" REF="68">
<HI>Habitus</HI> was more a &s;ub&s;tance than he
was; for his cloaths could better &s;ub&s;i&s;t
without him, than he without his
cloaths.</P>
<P>Martin &s;uppos'd an <HI>Univer&s;al Man</HI>
to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Bur|ge&s;s
of a Corporation, that repre&s;ented
a great many Individuals. His Father
a&s;k'd him, if he could not frame the
Idea of an Univer&s;al Lord Mayor?
Martin told him, that never having &s;een
but one Lord Mayor, the Idea of that
Lord Mayor always return'd to his
mind; that he had great difficulty to
ab&s;tract a Lord Mayor from his Fur,
Gown, and Gold Chain; nay, that the
hor&s;e he &s;aw the Lord Mayor ride up|on
not a little di&s;turb'd his imagination.
On the other hand Crambe, to &s;how
him&s;elf of a more penetrating genius,
&s;wore that he could frame a conception
of a Lord Mayor not only without his
Hor&s;e, Gown, and Gold Chain, but
even without Stature, Feature, Colour,
Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body;
which he &s;uppos'd was the ab&s;tract of
a Lord Mayor. Cornelius told him
<PB N="56" REF="69">
that he was a lying Ra&s;cal; that an
<HI>Univer&s;ale</HI> was not the object of imagi|nation,
and that there was no &s;uch
thing in reality, or <HI>a parte Rei.</HI> But I
can prove (quoth Crambe) that there
are <HI>Cly&s;ters a parte Rei,</HI> but <HI>cly&s;ters</HI> are
<HI>univer&s;ales</HI>; <HI>ergo.</HI> Thus I prove my
Minor. <HI>Quod aptum e&s;t ine&s;&s;e multis,</HI>
is an <HI>univer&s;ale</HI> by definition: but every
cly&s;ter before it is admini&s;tred has that
quality; therefore every cly&s;ter is an
<HI>univer&s;ale.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o found fault with the Ad|verti&s;ements,
that they were not &s;trict
logical <HI>definitions:</HI> In an adverti&s;e|ment
of a Dog &s;tol'n or &s;tray'd, he &s;aid
it ought to begin thus, <HI>An irrational a|nimal</HI>
of the <HI>Genus caninum,</HI> &amp;c. Cor|nelius
told them, that though tho&s;e ad|verti&s;ements
were not fram'd according
to the exact rules of logical definitions,
being only <HI>de&s;criptions</HI> of things <HI>numero
differentibus,</HI> yet they contain'd a faint
image of the <HI>praedicabilia,</HI> and were
highly &s;ub&s;ervient to the common pur|po&s;es
of life; often di&s;covering things
that were lo&s;t, both animate and ina|nimate.

<P>Though I'm afraid I have tran&s;gre&s;s'd
upon my Reader's patience already, I
cannot help taking notice of one thing
more extraordinary than any yet men|tion'd;
which was Crambe's <HI>Treati&s;e
of Syllogi&s;ms.</HI> He &s;uppos'd that a Phi|lo&s;opher's
brain was like a great Fore&s;t,
where Ideas rang'd like animals of &s;e|veral
kinds; that tho&s;e Ideas copulated,
and engender'd Conclu&s;ions; that
when tho&s;e of different Species copu|late,
they bring forth mon&s;ters or ab&s;ur|dities;
that the <HI>Major</HI> is the male, the
<HI>Minor</HI> the female, which copulate by
the Middle Term, and engender the
Conclu&s;ion. Hence they are call'd the
<HI>praemi&s;&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors</HI> of the Con|clu&s;ion;
and it is properly &s;aid by Lo|gicians

Propo&s;itions are Per&s;ons of quali|ty;

Propo&s;itions are Private per&s;ons, and
therefore plac'd in the third or la&s;t

all the rules of Syllogi&s;ms naturally
follow.<LIST>

only a &s;ingular conclu&s;ion, that is, if
the parents be only private people,

<P>So much for the Affirmative propo|&s;itions;

this Sy&s;tem, from whence he &s;aid one

<P>METAPHYSICKS were a large field
in which to exerci&s;e the Weapons <HI>Lo|gick</HI>
had put into their hands. Here
Martin and Crambe us'd to engage like
any prize fighters, before their Father,
and his other Learned companions of
the Sympo&s;iacks. And as Prize fight|ers
will agree to lay a&s;ide a buckler or

But it was found, that without

the help of the defen&s;ive armour of

&s;o deep, that they fetch'd blood at e|very

<HEAD>ANATOMY.</HEAD>
<P>COrnelius, it is certain, had a mo&s;t
&s;uper&s;titious veneration for the
Ancients; and if they contradicted each
other, his Rea&s;on was &s;o pliant and
ductile, that he was always of the
opinion of the la&s;t he read. But
he reckon'd it a point of honour never
to be vanqui&s;h'd in a di&s;pute; from
<PB N="65" REF="78">
which quality he acquir'd the title of
the <HI>Invincible Doctor.</HI> While the Pro|fe&s;&s;or
of Anatomy was demon&s;trating
to his &s;on the &s;everal kinds of <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI>
Cornelius affirm'd that there were only
two, the <HI>Colon</HI> and the <HI>Aichos,</HI> accord|ing
to Hippocrates, who it was impo&s;|&s;ible
could ever be mi&s;taken. It was
in vain to a&s;&s;ure him this error proceed|ed
from want of accuracy in dividing
the whole Canal of the Guts: Say
what you plea&s;e (he reply'd) this is
both mine and Hippocrates's opinion.
You may with equal rea&s;on (an&s;wer'd
the Profe&s;&s;or) affirm that a man's Liver
hath five Lobes, and deny the Circula|tion
of the blood. Ocular demon&s;tra|tion
(&s;aid Cornelius) &s;eems to be on
your &s;ide, yet I &s;hall not give it up:
Show me any vi&s;cus of a human body,
and I will bring you a Mon&s;ter that
differs from the common rule in the
&s;tructure of it. If Nature &s;hews &s;uch
variety in the &s;ame age, why may &s;he
not have extended it further in &s;everal
ages? Produce me a man now of the
age of an Antidiluvian; of the &s;trength
<PB N="66" REF="79">
of Samp&s;on, or the &s;ize of the Giants.
If in the whole, why not in parts of
the body, may it not be po&s;&s;ible the
pre&s;ent generation of men may differ
from the Ancients? The Moderns
have perhaps lengthen'd the channel
of the guts by Gluttony, and dimini&s;h'd
the liver by hard drinking. Though
it &s;hall be demon&s;trated that modern
blood circulates, yet I will &s;till believe
with Hippocrates, that the blood of
the Ancients had a flux and reflux from
the heart, like a Tide. Con&s;ider how
Luxury hath introduced new di&s;ea&s;es,
and with them not improbably alter'd
the whole Cour&s;e of the Fluids. Con|&s;ider
how the current of mighty Rivers,
nay the very channels of the Ocean are
changed from what they were in an|cient
days; and can we be &s;o vain to
imagine, that the Microco&s;m of the
human body alone is exempted from
the fate of all things? I que&s;tion not
but plau&s;ible Conjectures may be made
even as to the Time when the blood
fir&s;t began to circulate.&mdash;Such di&s;|putes
as the&s;e frequently perplex'd the

Profe&s;&s;or to that degree, that he would
now and then in a pa&s;&s;ion leave him in

this time.</P>
<P>There unfortunately happen'd &s;oon
after, an unu&s;ual accident, which re|tarded
the pro&s;ecution of the &s;tudies of
Martin. Having purcha&s;ed the body
of a Malefactor, he hir'd a Room for
its di&s;&s;ection near the Pe&s;t-fields in St.
Giles's, at a little di&s;tance from Tyburn
Road. Crambe (to who&s;e care this bo|dy
was committed) carry'd it thither
about twelve a clock at night in a Hack|ney-coach,
few Hou&s;e-keepers being
very willing to let their lodgings to &s;uch
kind of Operators. As he was &s;oftly
&s;talking up &s;tairs in the dark, with the
dead man in his arms, his burthen had
like to have &s;lipp'd from him, which
he (to &s;ave from falling) gra&s;p'd &s;o hard
about the belly that it forced the wind
through the <HI>Anus,</HI> with a noi&s;e exactly
like the <HI>Crepitus</HI> of a living man.
Crambe (who did not comprehend how
this part of the Animal Oeconomy could
remain in a dead man) was &s;o terrify'd,
<PB N="68" REF="81">
that he threw down the body, ran up
to his ma&s;ter, and had &s;carce breath to
tell him what had happen'd. Martin
with all his Philo&s;ophy could not pre|vail
upon him to return to his po&s;t.
You may &s;ay what you plea&s;e (quoth
Crambe) no man alive ever broke wind
more naturally; nay, he &s;eemed to be
mightily relieved by it. The rolling
of the corps down &s;tairs made &s;uch a
noi&s;e that it awak'd the whole hou&s;e.
The maid &s;hriek'd, the landlady cry'd
out Thieves; but the Landlord, in his
&s;hirt as he was, taking a candle in one
hand and a drawn &s;word in the other,
ventur'd out of the Room. The maid
with only a &s;ingle petticoat ran up &s;tairs,
but &s;purning at the dead body, fell up|on
it in a &s;woon. Now the Landlord
&s;tood &s;till and li&s;t'ned, then he look'd
behind him, and ventur'd down in this
manner one &s;tair after another, 'till he
came where lay his maid, as dead, up|on
another corps unknown. The wife
ran into the &s;treet and cry'd out Mur|der!
the Watch ran in, while Martin
and Crambe, hearing all this uproar,
<PB N="69" REF="82">
were coming down &s;tairs. The Watch
imagin'd they were making their e&s;cape,
&s;eiz'd them immediately, and carried
them to a neighbouring Ju&s;tice; where,
upon &s;earching them, &s;everal kind of
knives and dreadful weapons were found
upon them. The Ju&s;tice fir&s;t examin'd
Crambe. What is your Name? &s;ays
the Ju&s;tice. I have acquir'd (quoth
Crambe) no great Name as yet; they
call me Crambe or Crambo, no mat|ter
which, as to my &s;elf; though it
may be &s;ome di&s;pute to po&s;terity.&mdash;What
is yours and your Ma&s;ters pro|fe&s;&s;ion?<HI>&mdash;It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to imbrue

endeavour'd to interrupt him; but
the Ju&s;tice being &s;trangely a&s;toni&s;h'd
with the frankne&s;s of Crambe's Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
order'd him to proceed; upon
which he made the following Speech.</P>
<P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, as touch|ing

<HI>me, to a hair. They have hitherto talk'd
like num-&s;culls without brains; but if
your Wor&s;hip will not only give ear, but
regard me with a favourable eye, I will
not be brow-beaten by the &s;upercilious
looks of my adver&s;aries, who now &s;tand
cheek by jowl by your Wor&s;hip. I will
prove to their faces, that their foul mouths
have not open'd their lips without a fal|&s;ity;
though they have &s;hewed their teeth
as if they would bite off my no&s;e. Now,
Sir, that I may fairly &s;lip my Neck out
of the collar, I beg this matter may not
be &s;lightly &s;kin'd over. Tho' I have no
man here to back me, I will un-bo&s;om
my &s;elf, &s;ince Truth is on my &s;ide, and
&s;hall give them their bellies full, though
they think they have me upon the hip.
Whereas they &s;ay I came into their lodg|ings,
with arms, and murder'd this man
without their Privity, I declare I had
not the lea&s;t Finger in it; and &s;ince
I am to &s;tand upon my own legs, nothing
of this matter &s;hall be left till I &s;et it
upon a right foot. In the vein I am in,
I cannot for my heart's blood and guts
bear this u&s;age: I &s;hall not &s;pare my</HI>

ever reckon'd a good liver; and I think
I have the bowels of compa&s;&s;ion. I a&s;k

acknowledge my &s;elf your Wor&s;hip's hum|ble

<P>The Ju&s;tice &s;tared, the Landlord and
Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Mar|tin
fretted, while Crambe talk'd in this
rambling incoherent manner; till at
length Martin begg'd to be heard. It
was with great difficulty that the Ju|&s;tice

<HI>What Daemon, he cry'd, hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thee

<P>IT was a mo&s;t peculiar Talent in

<PB N="74" REF="87">
of Life, or in Learning. This can no
way be better exemplify'd, than in the
effect which the Puns of Crambe had
on the Mind and Studies of Martinus,
He conceiv'd, that &s;omewhat of a like
Talent to this of Crambe, of <HI>a&s;&s;embling
parallel &s;ounds,</HI> either <HI>&s;yllables,</HI> or <HI>words,</HI>

to try fir&s;t upon Virgil, Horace,

<P>BUT it is high time to return to the
Hi&s;tory of the Progre&s;s of Mar|tinus
in the Studies of Phy&s;ick, and to
enumerate &s;ome at lea&s;t of the many
Di&s;coveries and Experiments he made
therein.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t was his Method of

There will al&s;o be added the Re|pre&s;entation,
which on occa&s;ion of one
di&s;temper which was become almo&s;t e|pidemical,
he thought him&s;elf oblig'd
to lay before both Hou&s;es of Parliament,
intitled, <HI>A Propo&s;al for a General Flux,</HI>
to exterminate at one blow the P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">x

cour&s;e of Vomition) he deter|mined
to leave it off entirely, and to ap|ply

He attempted to find out Specificks for

throw their Patients into &s;weats,
vomits, purgations, &amp;c. he ca&s;t them
into Love, hatred, hope, fear, joy, grief,

of the Pa&s;&s;ions in the Engli&s;h
Nation, was the chief motive that in|duced
him to apply his whole &s;tudies,
while he continued among us, to the
Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e he directed, in the
fir&s;t place, his late acquir'd &s;kill in <HI>Ana|tomy.</HI>
He con&s;ider'd <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Vices</HI>
as certain Habits which proceed from
the natural Formation and Structure of
particular parts of the body. A Bird
flies becau&s;e it has Wings, a Duck
&s;wims becau&s;e it is web-footed: and
there can be no que&s;tion but the Adun|city
of the pounces, and beaks of the
Hawks, as well as the length of the
fangs, the &s;harpne&s;s of the teeth, and
the &s;trength of the crural and Ma&s;&s;eter|mu&s;cles

cau&s;e of the great and habitual Immo|rality

<P>AN eminent In&s;tance of Martinus's
Sagacity in di&s;covering the Di&s;|tempers
of the Mind, appear'd in the
ca&s;e of a young Nobleman at Court,
who was ob&s;erv'd to grow extremely
affected in his &s;peech, and whim&s;ical in
all his behaviour. He began to a&s;k
odd que&s;tions, talk in ver&s;e to him&s;elf,
&s;hut him&s;elf up from his friends, and be
acce&s;&s;ible to none, but Flatterers, Poets,
and Pickpockets; till his Relations and
old Acquaintance judged him to be &s;o
far gone, as to be a fit Patient for the
Doctor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had heard and exami|ned
all the &s;ymptoms, he pronounced
his di&s;temper to be <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>His friends a&s;&s;ured him that they had
with great care ob&s;erv'd all his motions,
<PB N="84" REF="97">
and were perfectly &s;atisfy'd there was
no Woman in the ca&s;e. Scriblerus
was as po&s;itive that he was de&s;perately
in love with &s;ome per&s;on or other.
<HI>How can that be? (&s;aid his Aunt, who
came to a&s;k the advice) when he conver&s;es
almo&s;t with none but him&s;elf?</HI> Say you
&s;o? he replied, why then he is in love
with Him&s;elf, one of the mo&s;t com|mon
ca&s;es in the world. I am a&s;to|ni&s;h'd,
people do not enough attend this
Di&s;ea&s;e, which has the &s;ame cau&s;es and
&s;ymptoms, and admits of the &s;ame cure,
with the other: e&s;pecially &s;ince here
the ca&s;e of the Patient is the more help|le&s;s
and deplorable of the two, as this
unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion is more blind than
the other. There are people who di&s;|cover
from their very youth a mo&s;t a|morous
inclination to them&s;elves;
which is unhappily nurs'd by &s;uch
Mothers, as with their good will, wou'd
never &s;uffer their children to be <HI>cro&s;s'd
in love.</HI> Ea&s;e, luxury, and idlene&s;s,
blow up this flame as well as the other:
Con&s;tant opportunities of conver&s;ation
with the per&s;on beloved, (the greate&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="98">
of incentives) are here impo&s;&s;ible to be
prevented. Bawds and Pimps in the
other love, will be perpetually doing
kind offices, &s;peaking a good word for
the party, and carry about Billet doux.
Therefore I a&s;k you, Madam, if this
Gentleman has not been much frequen|ted
by Flatterers, and a &s;ort of people
who bring him dedications and ver&s;es?
<HI>O Lord! Sir, (quoth the Aunt) the
hou&s;e is haunted with them.</HI> There it
is, (reply'd Scriblerus) tho&s;e are the
bawds and pimps that go between a
man and him&s;elf. Are there no civil
Ladies, that tell him he dre&s;&s;es well,
has a gentlemanly air, and the like?
<HI>Why truly Sir, my Nephew is not auk|ward</HI>&mdash;Look you Madam, this is
a misfortune to him: In former days
the&s;e &s;ort of lovers were happy in one
re&s;pect, that they never had any Rivals,
but of late they have all the Ladies &s;o&mdash;Be plea&s;ed to an&s;wer a few que&s;|tions
more. Whom does he generally
talk of? Him&s;elf, quoth the Aunt.
Who&s;e wit and breeding does he mo&s;t
commend? His own, quoth the Aunt.
<PB N="86" REF="99">
Whom does he write letters to? Him|&s;elf.
Whom does he dream of? All
the dreams I ever heard were of him|&s;elf.
Whom is he ogling yonder?
Him&s;elf in his looking-gla&s;s. Why
does he throw back his head in that
langui&s;hing po&s;ture? Only to be ble&s;t
with a &s;mile of him&s;elf as he pa&s;&s;es by,
Does he ever &s;teal a ki&s;s from him&s;elf,
by biting his lips? <HI>Oh continually, till
they are perfect vermilion.</HI> Have you
ob&s;erv'd him to u&s;e Familiarities with
any body? <HI>With none but him&s;elf: he
often embraces him&s;elf with folded arms,
he claps his hand often upon his hip, nay
&s;ometimes thru&s;ts it into&mdash;his brea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid the Doctor, all the&s;e
are &s;trong &s;ymptoms, but there remain
a few more. Has this amorous gentle|man
pre&s;ented him&s;elf with any Love|toys;
&s;uch as gold Snuff-boxes, repea|ting
Watches, or Tweezer-ca&s;es? tho&s;e
are things that in time will &s;often the
mo&s;t obdurate heart. <HI>Not only &s;o, (&s;aid
the Aunt) but he bought the other day a
very fine brilliant diamond Ring for his
own wearing.&mdash;</HI>Nay, if he has accep|ted
<PB N="87" REF="100">
of this Ring, the intrigue is very
forward indeed, and it is high time for
friends to interpo&s;e. Pray Madam, a
word or two more&mdash;Is he jealous that
his acquaintance do not behave them|&s;elves
with re&s;pect enough? will he
bear jokes and innocent freedoms?
<HI>By no means; a familiar appellation
makes him angry; if you &s;hake him a
little roughly by the hand, he is in a rage;
but if you chuck him under the chin he
will return you a box on the ear.</HI>&mdash;Then
the ca&s;e is plain: he has the true
Pathognomick &s;ign of Love, <HI>Jealou&s;ly</HI>;
for no body will &s;uffer his mi&s;tre&s;s to
be treated at that rate. Madam, upon
the whole this Ca&s;e is extreamly dange|rous.
There are &s;ome people who are
far gone in this pa&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-love, but
then they keep a <HI>very &s;ecret Intrigue</HI>
with them&s;elves, and hide it from all
the world be&s;ides. But this Patient
has not the lea&s;t care of the Reputati|on
of his Beloved, he is downright &s;can|dalous
in his behaviour with him&s;elf;
he is enchanted, bewitch'd, and almo&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="101">
pa&s;t cure. However let the following
methods be try'd upon him.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let him *** <HI>Hiatus.</HI> ***
Secondly, let him wear a Bob-wig.
Thirdly, &s;hun the Company of flatter|ers,
nay of ceremonious people, and of
all Frenchmen in general. It would
not be a mi&s;s if he travel'd over Eng|land
in a Stage-coach, and made the
Tour of Holland in a Track-&s;coute.
Let him return the Snuff-boxes, Twee|zer-ca&s;es,
(and particularly the Dia|mond

from him&s;elf. Let &s;ome knowing
friend repre&s;ent to him the many vile
Qualities of this Mi&s;tre&s;s of his: let
him be &s;hewn that her Extravagance,
Pride, and Prodigality will infallibly
bring him to a mor&s;el of bread: Let it
be prov'd, that he has been Fal&s;e to
him&s;elf, and if Treachery is not a &s;uf|ficient
cau&s;e to di&s;card a Mi&s;tre&s;s, what
is? In &s;hort let him be made to &s;ee
that no mortal be&s;ides him&s;elf either
loves or can &s;uffer this Creature. Let
all Looking-gla&s;&s;es, poli&s;h'd Toys, and
even clean Plates beremoved from him,
<PB N="89" REF="102">
for fear of bringing back the admired
object. Let him be taught to put off
all tho&s;e tender airs, affected &s;miles,
langui&s;hing looks, wanton to&s;&s;es of the
head, coy motions of the body, that
mincing gait, &s;oft tone of voice, and all
that enchanting woman-like behaviour,
that has made him the charm of his
own eyes, and the object of his own a|doration.
Let him &s;urprize the Beauty
he adores at a di&s;advantage, &s;urvey him|&s;elf
naked, dive&s;ted of artificial charms,
and he will find him&s;elf a forked &s;trad|ling
Animal, with bandy legs, a &s;hort
neck, a dun hide, and a pot-belly. It
would be yet better if he took a &s;trong
purge once a week, in order to contem|plate
him&s;elf in that condition: at
which time it will be convenient to
make u&s;e of the Letters, Dedications,
&amp;c. above&s;aid. Something like this
has been ob&s;erv'd by Lucretius and o|thers
to be a powerful remedy in the
ca&s;e of Women. If all this will not
do, I mu&s;t e'en leave the poor man to
his de&s;tiny. Let him <HI>marry him&s;elf,</HI>
and when he is condemn'd eternally to

<HEAD>How <HI>Martinus</HI> endeavoured to find out
the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and of his Cor|re&s;pondence
with the <HI>Free-Thinkers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this De&s;ign of Martin to inve&s;ti|gate
the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind, he
thought nothing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as an En|quiry
after the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI>; in
which at fir&s;t he labour'd under great
uncertainties. Sometimes he was of
opinion that it lodg'd in the Brain,
&s;ometimes in the Stomach, and &s;ome|times
in the Heart. Afterwards he
thought it ab&s;urd to confine that &s;ove|reign
Lady to one apartment, which
made him infer that &s;he &s;hifted it ac|cording
to the &s;everal functions of life:
The Brain was her Study, the Heart
her State-room, and the Stomach her
Kitchen. But as he &s;aw &s;everal Offices
<PB N="91" REF="104">
of life went on at the &s;ame time, he
was forc'd to give up this Hypothe&s;is
al&s;o. He now conjectured it was more
for the dignity of the Soul to perform
&s;everal operations by her little Mini&s;ters,
the <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> from whence it was
natural to conclude, that &s;he re&s;ides in
different parts according to different In|clinations,
Sexes, Ages, and Profe&s;&s;ions.
Thus in Epicures he &s;eated her in the
mouth of the Stomach, Philo&s;ophers
have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their
Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fid|lers
in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers
in their Toes. At length he grew fond
of the <HI>Glandula Pinealis,</HI> di&s;&s;ecting
many Subjects to find out the different
Figure of this Gland, from whence he
might di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the diffe|rent
Tempers in mankind. He &s;up|pos'd
that in factious and re&s;tle&s;s-&s;pirit|ed
people he &s;hould find it &s;harp and
pointed, allowing no room for the Soul
to repo&s;e her&s;elf; that in quiet Tem|pers
it was flat, &s;mooth, and &s;oft, af|fording
to the Soul as it were an ea&s;y
cu&s;hion. He was confirm'd in this by
<PB N="92" REF="105">
ob&s;erving, that Calves and Philo&s;ophers,
Tygers and State&s;men, Foxes and Shar|pers,
Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Spar|rows
and Coquets, Monkeys and Play|ers,
Courtiers and Spaniels, Moles and
Mi&s;ers, exactly re&s;emble one another
in the conformation of the <HI>Pineal
Gland.</HI> He did not doubt likewi&s;e to
find the &s;ame re&s;emblance in Highway|men
and Conquerors: In order to &s;a|tisfy
him&s;elf in which, it was, that
he purcha&s;ed the body of one of the
fir&s;t Species (as hath been before rela|ted)
at Tyburn, hoping in time to have
the happine&s;s of one of the latter too,
under his Anatomical knife.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit taking notice here
that the&s;e Enquiries into the <HI>Seat</HI> of
the <HI>Soul</HI> gave occa&s;ion to his fir&s;t cor|re&s;pondence
with the &s;ociety of <HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI>
who were then in their infan|cy
in England, and &s;o much taken with
the promi&s;ing endowments of Martin,
that they order'd their Secretary to
write him the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="93" REF="106">
<HEAD>To the learned Inqui&s;itor into Nature,
MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS: The
Society of <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> greeting.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Grecian</HI> Coffee-Hou&s;e, <DATE>May 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with un&s;peakable joy we have
heard of your Inqui&s;itive Geni|us,
and we think it great pity that it
&s;hould not be better employed, than in
looking after that Theological Non-en|tity
commonly call'd the <HI>Soul:</HI> Since
after all your enquiries, it will appear
you have lo&s;t your labour in &s;eeking
the Re&s;idence of &s;uch a Chimera, that
never had being but in the brains of
&s;ome dreaming Philo&s;ophers. Is it not
<HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> to a per&s;on of your Sen&s;e,
that &s;ince <HI>you cannot find it,</HI> there is <HI>no
&s;uch thing?</HI> In order to &s;et &s;o hopeful
a Genius right in this matter, we have
&s;ent you an an&s;wer to the ill-grounded
Sophi&s;ms of tho&s;e crack-brain'd fellows,
and likewi&s;e an ea&s;y <HI>mechanical Expla|nation</HI>
of <HI>Perception</HI> or <HI>Thinking.</HI></P>
<P>One of their chief Arguments is,
<PB N="94" REF="107">
that <HI>Self-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> cannot inhere in
any &s;y&s;tem of Matter, becau&s;e all mat|ter
is made up of &s;everal di&s;tinct beings,
which never can make up one indivi|dual
thinking being.</P>
<P>This is ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd by a familiar
in&s;tance. In every <HI>Jack</HI> there is a <HI>meat|roa&s;ting</HI>
Quality, which neither re&s;ides
in the Fly, nor in the Weight, nor in
any particular wheel of the Jack, but
is the re&s;ult of the whole compo&s;ition:
So in an Animal, the Self-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
is not a real Quality inherent in one Be|ing
(any more than meat-roa&s;ting in
a Jack) but the re&s;ult of &s;everal Modes
or qualities in the &s;ame &s;ubject. As
the fly, the wheels, the chain, the
weight, the cords, &amp;c. make one Jack,
&s;o the &s;everal parts of the body make
one Animal. As perception or con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
is &s;aid to be inherent in this A|nimal,
&s;o is meat-roa&s;ting &s;aid to be in|herent
in the Jack. As &s;en&s;ation, rea|&s;oning,
volition, memory, &amp;c. are the
&s;everal Modes of thinking; &s;o roa&s;ting
of beef, roa&s;ting of mutton, roa&s;ting
of pullets, gee&s;e, turkeys, &amp;c. are the
<PB N="95" REF="108">
&s;everal modes of meat-roa&s;ting. And
as the general Quality of meat-roa&s;ting,
with its &s;everal modifications as to beef,
mutton, pullets, &amp;c. does not inhere
in any one part of the Jack; &s;o nei|ther
does con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, with its &s;eve|ral
modes of &s;en&s;ation, intellection,
volition, &amp;c. inhere in any one, but is
the re&s;ult from the mechanical compo|&s;ition
of the whole Animal.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o, the Quality or di&s;po&s;ition in
a Fiddle to play tunes, with the &s;eve|ral
modifications of this <HI>tune-playing</HI>
quality in playing of Preludes, Sara|bands,
Jigs, and Gavotts, are as much
real qualities in the In&s;trument, as the
thought or the imagination is in the
mind of the Per&s;on that compo&s;es them.</P>
<P>The Parts (&s;ay they) of an animal
body are perpetually chang'd, and the
fluids which &s;eem to be &s;ubject of con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,
are in a perpetual circulati|on;
&s;o that the &s;ame individual parti|cles
do not remain in the Brain; from
whence it will follow, that the idea of
Individual Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t be con|&s;tantly
tran&s;lated from one particle of
<PB N="96" REF="109">
matter to another, whereby the parti|cle
A, for example, mu&s;t not only be
con&s;cious, but con&s;cious that it is the
&s;ame being with the particle B that
went before.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, this is only a fallacy of
the imagination, and is to be under&s;tood
in no other &s;en&s;e than that maxim of
the Engli&s;h Law, that the <HI>King never
dies.</HI> This power of thinking, &s;elf|moving,
and governing the whole Ma|chine,
is communicated from every
Particle to its immediate Succe&s;&s;or;
who, as &s;oon as he is gone, immediate|ly
takes upon him the Government,
which &s;till pre&s;erves the Unity of the
whole Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>They make a great noi&s;e about this
Individuality: how a man is con&s;cious
to him&s;elf that he is the &s;ame Indivi|dual
he was twenty years ago; notwith|&s;tanding
the flux &s;tate of the Particles
of matter that compo&s;e his body. We
think this is capable of a very plain an|&s;wer,
and may be ea&s;ily illu&s;trated by a
familiar example.</P>
<P>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black
<PB N="97" REF="110">
wor&s;ted &s;tockings, which his maid darn'd
&s;o often with &s;ilk, that they became
at la&s;t a pair of &s;ilk, &s;tockings. Now
&s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e &s;tockings of Sir John's
endued with &s;ome degree of Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
at every particular darning, they
would have been &s;en&s;ible, that they
were the &s;ame individual pair of &s;tock|ings
both before and after the darning;
and this &s;en&s;ation would have continued
in them through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
darnings; and yet after the la&s;t of all,
there was not perhaps one thread left
of the fir&s;t pair of &s;tockings, but they
were grown to be &s;ilk &s;tockings, as was
&s;aid before.</P>
<P>And whereas it is affirm'd, that eve|ry
animal is con&s;cious of &s;ome indivi|dual
&s;elf-moving, &s;elf-determining prin|ciple;
it is an&s;wer'd, that as in a Hou&s;e
of Commons all things are determin'd
by a <HI>Majority,</HI> &s;o it is in every Animal
&s;y&s;tem. As that which determines the
Hou&s;e is &s;aid to be the rea&s;on of the
whole a&s;&s;embly; it is no otherwi&s;e with
thinking Beings, who are determin'd
by the greater force of &s;everal particles;
<PB N="98" REF="111">
which, like &s;o many unthinking Mem|bers,
compo&s;e one thinking Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>And whereas it is likewi&s;e objected,
that Puni&s;hments cannot be ju&s;t that
are not inflicted upon the &s;ame indivi|dual,
which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the
notion of a &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance. We
reply, that this is no greater difficulty
to conceive, than that a Corporation,
which is likewi&s;e a flux body, may be
puni&s;hed for the faults, and liable to
the debts, of their Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>We proceed now to explain, by the
&s;tructure of the Brain, the &s;everal
Modes of thinking. It is well known
to Anatomi&s;ts that the Brain is a <HI>Con|geries</HI>
of Glands, that &s;eparate the fi|ner
parts of the blood, call'd Animal
Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a
canal of a great length, variou&s;ly in|torted
and wound up together. From
the Arietadion and Motion of the Spi|rits
in tho&s;e Canals, proceed all the
different &s;orts of Thoughts: Simple I|deas
are produced by the motion of the
Spirits in one &s;imple Canal: when two
of the&s;e Canals di&s;embogue them&s;elves
<PB N="99" REF="112">
into one, they make what we call a
Propo&s;ition; and when two of the&s;e
propo&s;itional Chanels empty them&s;elves
into a third, they form a Syllogi&s;m, or
a Ratiocination. Memory is perform'd
in a di&s;tinct apartment of the brain,
made up of ve&s;&s;els &s;imilar, and like &s;i|tuated
to the ideal, propo&s;itional, and
&s;yllogi&s;tical ve&s;&s;els, in the primary parts
of the brain. After the &s;ame manner
it is ea&s;y to explain the other modes of
thinking; as al&s;o why &s;ome people
think &s;o wrong and perver&s;ely, which
proceeds from the bad configuration of
tho&s;e Glands. Some for example, are
born without the propo&s;itional or &s;yl|logi&s;tical
Canals; in others that rea&s;on
ill, they are of unequal capacities; in
dull fellows, of too great a length,
whereby the motion of the &s;pirits is re|tarded;
in trifling genius's, weak and
&s;mall: in the over-refining &s;pirits, too
much intorted and winding; and &s;o of
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We are &s;o much per&s;uaded of the
truth of this our Hypothe&s;is, that we
have employ'd one of our Members, a
<PB N="100" REF="113">
great Virtuo&s;o at Nuremberg, to make
a &s;ort of an Hydraulick Engine, in
which a chimical liquor re&s;embling
Blood, is driven through Ela&s;tick cha|nels
re&s;embling Arteries and veins, by
the force of an Embolus like the heart,
and wrought by a pneumatick Machine
of the nature of the lungs, with ropes
and pullies, like the nerves, tendons and
mu&s;cles: And we are per&s;waded that
this our artificial Man will not only
walk, and &s;peak, and perform mo&s;t of
the outward actions of the animal life,
but (being wound up once a week)
will perhaps rea&s;on as well as mo&s;t of
your Country Par&s;ons.</P>

for the honour of having you a

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The &s;tyle of this Chapter in the

</HEADNOTE>
<P>BUT now the &s;ucce&s;sful Cour&s;e of
the Studies of Martin was inter|rupted
by <HI>Love:</HI> Love, that unnerves
the Vigour of the Hero, and &s;oftens
<PB N="103" REF="116">
the Severity of the Philo&s;opher. It
chanced, that as Martin was walking
forth to inhale the fre&s;h breeze of the
Evening, after the long and &s;evere
Studies of the day, and pa&s;&s;ing through
the We&s;tern Confines of the famous
Metropolis of Albion, not far from the
proud Battlements of the Palace of
Whitehall, who&s;e walls are embraced
by the &s;ilver Thames; his eyes were
drawn upwards by a large &s;quare piece
of Canvas, which hung forth to the view
of the pa&s;&s;ing Citizens. Upon it was
pourtrayed by &s;ome accurate pencil, the
Lybian Leopard more fierce than in his
native De&s;art; the mighty Lion, who
boa&s;ted thrice the bulk of the Nemaean
mon&s;ter; before whom &s;tood the little
Jackall, the faithful &s;py of the King of
bea&s;ts: Near the&s;e was placed, of two
Cubits high, the black Prince of Mono|motapa;
by who&s;e &s;ide were &s;een the
glaring Cat-a-mountain, the quill-dar|ting
Porcupine, and the Man-mimick|ing
Manteger. Clo&s;e adjoining to this,
hung another piece of Canvas on which
was di&s;play'd the pourtrait of two Bo|hemian
<PB N="104" REF="117">
Dam&s;els, whom Nature had as
clo&s;ely united as the ancient Herma|phroditus
and Salmacis; and whom it
was as impo&s;&s;ible to divide, as the
mingled waters of the gentle Thames
and the amorous I&s;is. While Martin
&s;tood in a meditating po&s;ture, fea&s;ting
his eyes on this Picture, he heard on a
&s;udden the &s;onorous notes of a Clarion,
which &s;eem'd of the pure&s;t cry&s;tal: In
an in&s;tant the pa&s;&s;ing multitude flock'd
to the &s;ound, as when a Drum &s;um|mons
the &s;traggling &s;oldiers to the ap|proaching
Battle. The youthful Vir|tuo&s;o,
who was in daily pur&s;uit of the
Curio&s;ities of Nature, was immediately
&s;urrounded by the gazing throng. The
doors, for ever barr'd to the pennyle&s;s
populace, &s;eem'd to open them&s;elves at
his producing a &s;ilver Six-pence, which
(like Aeneas's golden bough) gain'd
him admi&s;&s;ion into that Scene of Won|ders.
He no &s;ooner enter'd the fir&s;t
apartment, but his no&s;trils were &s;truck
with the &s;cent of Carnage; broken
Bones and naked Carca&s;&s;es be&s;trow'd
the floor. The maje&s;tick Lion rouz'd
<PB N="105" REF="118">
from his bed, and &s;hook his brindled
Mane; the &s;potted Leopard gna&s;h'd
his angry teeth, and walking to and fro,
in indignation rattled his chains. Mar|tin
with infinite plea&s;ure heard the Hi|&s;tory
of the &s;everal Mon&s;ters, which
was courteou&s;ly open'd to him by a
Per&s;on of a grave and earne&s;t mien;
who&s;e frank behaviour and ready an|&s;wers
di&s;cover'd him to have been long
conver&s;ant with different Nations, and
to have journey'd through di&s;tant Re|gions.
By him he was informed, that
the Lion was hunted on the hills of
Lebanon, by the Ba&s;ha of Jeru&s;alem;
that the Leopard was nurs'd in the un|inhabited
woods of Lybia; the Porcu|pine
came from the kingdom of Pre&s;|ter-John,
and the Manteger was a true
de&s;cendant of the celebrated Hanniman
the Magnificent. Sir, &s;aid Mr. Ran|dal

&s;tature to a man on hor&s;eback. Alas!
we have lo&s;t the cha&s;te bird Porphyrion!
the whole Race was de&s;troy'd by Wo|men,
becau&s;e they di&s;cover'd the infi|delity
of wives to their hu&s;bands. The
Merops too is now no where to be found,
the only bird that flew backward by
the tail. But &s;ay, can&s;t thou inform
me, what Dialect of the Greek is &s;po|ken
by the birds of Diomedes'i&s;land?
for it is from them only we can learn
the true pronunciation of that ancient
language.&mdash;Mr. Randal made no &s;a|tisfactory
an&s;wer to the&s;e demands, but
harangued chiefly upon modern Mon|&s;ters,
<PB N="109" REF="122">
and &s;eem'd willing to confine his
in&s;tances to the Animals of his own col|lection,
pointing to each of them in
order with his Rod.</P>
<P>After Martin had &s;atisfy'd his curi|o&s;ity
here, he was conducted into ano|ther
Apartment. Ju&s;t at the entrance
of the door appear'd a Negroe Prince.
His habiliments be&s;poke him royal;
his head was crown'd with the feather
of an O&s;trich, his &s;able feet and legs
were interlaced with Purple and Gold,
&s;pangled with the Diamonds of Corn|wall,
and the precious &s;tones of Bri&s;tol.
Though his &s;tature was of the lowe&s;t,
yet he behav'd him&s;elf with &s;uch an
Air of Grandeur, as gave evident to|kens
of his Regal Birth and Education.
He was mounted upon the le&s;t Palfrey
in the Univer&s;e; a Palfrey who&s;e na|tural
Beauty &s;tood not in need of tho&s;e
various colour'd Ribbons which braided
his Mane, and were interwoven with
his Tail. Again the chry&s;tal Clarion
founded, and after &s;everal courteous
&s;peeches between the black Prince and
Martin, our youthful Philo&s;opher
<PB N="110" REF="123">
walk'd into the mid&s;t of the room, to
ble&s;s his &s;ight with the mo&s;t beautiful
Curio&s;ity of Nature. On a &s;udden en|ter'd
at another door the two Bohemi|an
Si&s;ters, who&s;e common parts of Ge|neration,
had &s;o clo&s;ely ally'd them,
that Nature &s;eem'd here to have con|&s;pired
with Fortune, that their lives
&s;hould run in an eternal Parallel.</P>
<P>The Sun had twice eight times per|form'd
his annual cour&s;e, &s;ince their
Mother brought them into the world
with double pangs. Lindamira's eyes
were of a lively blue; Indamora's were
black and piercing. Lindamira's cheeks
might rival the blu&s;h of the morning;
in Indamora the Lilly overcame the
Ro&s;e. Lindamira's tre&s;&s;es were of the
paler Gold, while the locks of Inda|mora
were black and glo&s;&s;y as the
Plumes of a Raven.</P>
<P>How great is the power of Love in
human brea&s;ts! In vain has the Wi&s;e
man recour&s;e to his Rea&s;on, when the
in&s;inuating Arrow touches his heart,
and the plea&s;ing poi&s;on is diffu&s;ed
through his veins. But then how vio|lent,
<PB N="111" REF="124">
how tran&s;porting mu&s;t that pa&s;|&s;ion
prove, where not only the Fire of
Youth, but the unquenchable Curio&s;i|ty
of a Philo&s;opher, pitch'd upon the
&s;ame object! For how much &s;oever
our Martin was enamour'd on her as a
beautiful Woman, he was infinitely
more ravi&s;h'd with her as a charming
Mon&s;ter. What wonder then, if his
gentle Spirit, already humaniz'd by a
polite Education to receive all &s;oft im|pre&s;&s;ions,
and fired by the &s;ight of
tho&s;e beauties &s;o lavi&s;hly expos'd to his
view, &s;hould prove unable to re&s;i&s;t at
once &s;o plea&s;ing a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o ami|able
a Phaenomenon?</P>
<P>Martin, who felt the true emotions
of Love, blu&s;h'd that the Object of
his flame &s;hould be &s;o openly pro&s;titu|ted
to vulgar eyes. And though he
had been permitted to peru&s;e her mo&s;t
&s;ecret charms, yet his honourable pa&s;|&s;ion
was &s;o &s;trong, that it ran into the
extreme of ba&s;hfulne&s;s; &s;o that at the
fir&s;t interview he made no Overtures of
his Love. Pen&s;ive he return'd, and
flinging him&s;elf on his Couch, pa&s;s'd
<PB N="112" REF="125">
away the tedious hours of the night in
the utmo&s;t Inquietude. The ru&s;hy
Taper afforded a glimm'ring light, by
which he contemplated the tender lines
of Ovid; but alas! his Remedy of Love
was no cure for our unhappy Lover's
Anxiety! He clo&s;ed the amorous vo|lume,
&s;igh'd, and ca&s;ting his eyes a|round
on the Books that adorned his
room, broke forth in this pathetic Apo|&s;trophe.</P>
<P>O ye Spirits of Antiquity, who yet
live in tho&s;e &s;acred leaves! why do I
make you con&s;cious of my &s;hame? Yet
why &s;hould I depreciate the noble Pa&s;|&s;ion
of Love, and call it Shame? your
Heroes have felt it, your Poets and O|rators
have prais'd it. Were I ena|mour'd
on &s;ome gaudy Virgin, did I
doat on vulgar Perfection, the Lu&s;tre
of an Eye, or the Ro&s;e of a Cheek;
with rea&s;on might I blu&s;h before you,
mo&s;t learned Inqui&s;itors into Nature!
mo&s;t reverend Pliny, Aelian, and Al|drovandus!
Yet &s;ure you cannot di&s;ap|prove
of this, which is no wanton Pa&s;|&s;ion,
but excited by &s;o unparallel'd a
<PB N="113" REF="126">
Production; a flame, that may not on|ly
ju&s;tify it&s;elf to the Severity of a Phi|lo&s;opher,
but even to the Avarice of a
Parent; &s;ince &s;he who cau&s;es it carries
a mo&s;t plentiful Fortune in the &s;ole Ex|hibition
of her per&s;on. Heavens!
how I wonder at the Stupidity of man|kind,
who can affix the opprobrious
Name of Mon&s;tro&s;ity to what is only
Variety of Beauty, and a Profu&s;ion of
generous Nature? If there are charms
in one face, one mouth, one body; if
there are charms in two eyes, two
brea&s;ts, two arms; are they not all re|doubled
in the Object of my Pa&s;&s;ion?
What tho'&s;he be the common Gaze of
the multitude, and is follow'd about by
the &s;tupid and ignorant; does &s;he not
herein re&s;emble the greate&s;t Princes,
and the greate&s;t Beauties? only with
this difference, that her Admirers are
more numerous, and more la&s;ting.</P>
<P>Thus &s;igh'd he away the melancholy
Night; but no &s;ooner had Aurora,
with blu&s;hes in her cheeks (as con&s;ci|ous
that &s;he was ju&s;t ri&s;en from the
embraces of Tithon) advanc'd through
<PB N="114" REF="127">
the purple gates of the ea&s;t, but Mar|tin
ro&s;e: He ro&s;e indeed, but Melan|choly,
the companion of his &s;lumbers,
ro&s;e and wak'd with him. This was
the fir&s;t day that he amu&s;ed him&s;elf
with the gaudy Ornaments of the bo|dy;
that with &s;ecret plea&s;ure he con|templated
his Face, and the &s;ymmetry
of his limbs in a looking-gla&s;s. And
now for&s;aking his &s;olitary apartment,
he walked directly to the habitation
that confined the Object of his de&s;ires.
But as it is ob&s;erv'd that the Curious
never wander into the City to indulge
their thir&s;t of knowledge'till about the
hours of eleven or twelve; the Morn|ing
has ever been the &s;ea&s;on of Repo&s;e
for all tho&s;e Animals, who (trapann'd
by the frauds of Men) have been o|blig'd
to change their Woods and Wil|derne&s;&s;es
for Lodgings in Cities at the
rate of four &s;hillings a week. There|fore
Martin at this early hour was nei|ther
&s;aluted by the &s;ound of the Trum|pet,
nor were his eyes fea&s;ted as before
with the plea&s;ing picture of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s;
but he walked to and fro before
<PB N="115" REF="128">
the door with folded arms, from the
hour of five to eleven, humming in a
low and melancholy tune.</P>
<P>The Trumpet no &s;ooner &s;ounded,
but his heart leapt for joy, and a &s;e|cond
&s;ix-pence gain'd him a &s;econd ad|mittance
into her apartment. Yet this
day al&s;o, he only own'd his Pa&s;&s;ion in
the language of his Eyes: But alas!
this language is only under&s;tood by tho&s;e
that love, and Lindamira remain'd &s;till
ignorant of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time it was no &s;mall
cau&s;e of wonder to Mr. Randal, that
this Gentleman &s;hould come every day
to behold the &s;ame &s;how. He, no le&s;s
covetous than the Guardian of a rich
Heire&s;s, entertain'd a &s;u&s;picion that
Martin had a de&s;ign of &s;tealing the La|dies.
He thereupon i&s;&s;ued out &s;trict
Orders, not to admit our Lover on any
pretence what&s;oever. What Torments
mu&s;t this occa&s;ion in the raging feaver
of Love! Martin had now recour&s;e to
Stratagem, and by a Bribe (which of|ten
even the Ermine and Scarlet Robe
cannot re&s;i&s;t) gain'd the Dwarf who
<PB N="116" REF="129">
kept the gates of the Show-room, to
promote his Amour. He promis'd to
convey a Letter to Lindamira the &s;ame
evening, if he would bring it him
when darkne&s;s favour'd his de&s;ign, at
the apartment next the Mon&s;ters. Mar|tin
overjoy'd, ha&s;ted home, and after
having con&s;ulted all the Authors that
treat of Love, compo&s;ed his Billet|doux,
and at the time appointed went
to entru&s;t it to the hands of his Confi|dent.
Softly he &s;tole up &s;tairs, approach'd
the door, and gave a gentle rap; when
on a &s;udden a &s;mall hand was thru&s;t
through a little hole at the bottom of
the door, whence i&s;&s;ued an unintelli|gible,
&s;queaking voice. Martin con|cluding
it to be the Signal, delivered
his Epi&s;tle, and made his retreat unob|&s;erv'd.
He was no &s;ooner retir'd, but
Mr. Randal enter'd, and (as it was his
u&s;ual cu&s;tom before he went to bed)
took a view if all were &s;afe in the
Show-room. At his coming in, he
&s;aw his Monkey exceedingly bu&s;y in
picking the Seal-wax by little bits from
a Letter, which he turn'd over and o|ver
<PB N="117" REF="130">
with infinite &s;atisfaction. Mr.
Randal, not thinking it a breach of
honour to pry into the &s;ecrets of his
own family, took the Letter from him,
and read as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the mo&s;t amiable LINDAMIRA,</HEAD>
<P>WHile others, O darling of Na|ture,
look upon thee with the
eyes of Curio&s;ity, I behold thee with
tho&s;e of Love. Since I have been
&s;truck with thy mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing
Charms, how have I call'd upon Na|ture
to make a new head, new arms,
and a new body to &s;prout from this
&s;ingle Trunk of mine, and to double
every member, &s;o to render me a
proper Mate for &s;o lovely a Pair!
but think to how little purpo&s;e it will
be for thee to &s;tay till Nature &s;hall
form another of thy kind! In &s;uch
beauties &s;he exhau&s;ts her whole art,
and cannot afford to be prodigal. Ages
mu&s;t be numbred, nay perhaps &s;ome
Comet may vitrify this Globe on which
we tread, before we behold a Ca&s;tor
<PB N="118" REF="131">
and a Pollux re&s;embling the beauteous
Lindamira and Indamora. Nature
forms her wonders for the Wi&s;e, and
&s;uch a Ma&s;ter-piece &s;he could de&s;ign
for none but a Philo&s;opher. Cea&s;e
then to di&s;play tho&s;e beauties to the
prophane Vulgar, which were created
to crown the de&s;ires of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Pa&s;&s;ionate Admirer,
MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Dwarf enter'd as he was read|ing
the Letter, and perceiving his Ma|&s;ter
mov'd with pa&s;&s;ion, immediately
fell on his knees and confe&s;s'd the
whole affair. Mr. Randal bent on re|venge,
cau&s;ed him to ha&s;ten to Mar|tin's
hou&s;e, with a&s;&s;urances that Lin|damira
had read his Letter with infinite
&s;atisfaction, and conjured him that he
would immediately favour her e&s;cape.
Martin overjoy'd at the news, flew thi|ther
on the Wings of Love. The per|fidious
Dwarf conducted him up &s;tairs
in the dark, gently open'd the door,
<PB N="119" REF="132">
and bad him enter. How happy was
Martin in that in&s;tant, who thought
of nothing but leaping into the four
&s;oft arms of his Mi&s;tre&s;s! when lo, on
a &s;udden he &s;aw at the further end of
the Room two glitt'ring balls of Fire,
which roll'd to and fro in a mo&s;t terri|ble
manner. Immediately his ears were
invaded with horrid hi&s;&s;ings and &s;pit|tings,
the balls of Fire drew nearer
him, and the noi&s;e redoubled as he ap|proach'd.
Our Philo&s;opher bold and
re&s;olute with love, ventur'd towards it;
when all at once he perceiv'd &s;omething
gra&s;p him hard by the throat, and fix
as it were &s;harp lances in his cheek, &s;o
that blood trickled amain down his chin.
Thrice Martin e&s;&s;ay'd to free him&s;elf,
but vain were all his endeavours: till
at length, to &s;ave his life, he was for|ced
to betray his Intrigue, and alarm
the hou&s;e with reiterated cries of Mur|der.
The apartment of the Bohemian
Beauties being the adjoining Room,
they were the fir&s;t that enter'd with a
light to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Martin all bloody
as he was, a mo&s;t fierce Cat-a-moun|tain
<PB N="120" REF="133">
hanging at his chin, (which Mr.
Randal had maliciou&s;ly placed there on
purpo&s;e) at the &s;ight of Lindamira
forgot his di&s;tre&s;s. Ah, my Love! (he
cry'd) how like is thy fate to that of
Thi&s;be! who &s;taying but a moment too
late, found, as &s;he thought, her mi&s;e|rable
Lover torn in pieces by a Savage
bea&s;t! The affrighted Dam&s;els &s;kriek'd
aloud, Mr. Randal with all his Reti|nue
ru&s;h'd into the room, and now e|very
hand con&s;pired to free his under|jaw
from the &s;harp teeth of the enraged-Mon&s;ter.
But the Lady, who&s;e heart
melted at the piteous Spectacle, was &s;o
zealous in this office of Humanity, that
the Cat-a-mountain, provok'd at her
good-natur'd diligence, leap'd furiou&s;ly
on her, and wounded three of her hands
and her two no&s;es, to &s;uch a barbarous
degree that &s;he was not fit to be &s;hown
publickly for the &s;pace of three weeks.
The generous Lover, more wounded
at this Spectacle than at all the &s;cratches
he had him&s;elf receiv'd, charg'd the
mon&s;ter again with the utmo&s;t Intre|pidity,
and re&s;cued his mangled Mi&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="121" REF="134">
Then (having taken her by the hand,
and given it a gentle gra&s;p) he retreated
with his eye fixed upon her, and ju&s;t
as he left the room (in a low and ten|der
Accent) thus breath'd forth his
Soul. <HI>Behold, all this have I &s;uffered
for you.</HI></P>
<P>Such, and &s;o mode&s;t was the fir&s;t
Declaration of Love, made on this e|minent
occa&s;ion by our youthful Philo|&s;opher.
Nor was it ungently receiv'd by
the &s;imple and innocent Lindamira;
who hitherto unus'd to the &s;oft Prote&s;|tations
of adoring Slaves, had rather
been wonder'd at than belov'd; and re|ceiv'd
but imperfect notions of that ten|der
language, from the Addre&s;&s;es only
of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</P>
<P>Martin, notwith&s;tanding this unfor|tunate
adventure, &s;till pur&s;ued his
wi&s;hes. His Letters were now no
more intercepted. Lindamira read
them, and behav'd like other courte|ous
dames when they receive tho&s;e a|morous
Te&s;timonials; conceal'd them
from her Guardian, and return'd the
mo&s;t engaging an&s;wers. In &s;hort, &s;he
<PB N="122" REF="135">
was &s;o far captivated, as to re&s;olve no
longer to be gaz'd at like a publick
Beauty in her own A&s;&s;embly; but re|tire
from the world, and become the
virtuous Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family.</P>
<P>But Fate had &s;o ordain'd, that Mar|tin
was not more enamoured on Lin|damira,
than Indamora was on Martin.
She, jealous that her Si&s;ter had the
greate&s;t &s;hare in this conque&s;t, re&s;ented
that an equal application had not been
made to her&s;elf. She teiz'd Lindami|ra
to &s;uch a degree on this &s;ubject, as
made her promi&s;e to &s;ee Martin no
more. But then again might Indamo|ra
be deem'd the unhappie&s;t of Women,
whom her Pa&s;&s;ion and Imprudence had
robb'd of the &s;ight of her Lover. Yet
&s;hame cau&s;ed her to conceal tho&s;e anxi|eties
from her Si&s;ter. And let the Rea|der
judge how unhappy the Nymph
mu&s;t be, who was even depriv'd the
univer&s;al Relief of a <HI>Soliloquy.</HI> How|ever,
thus &s;he thought, without being
allow'd to tell it to any Grove or pur|ling
Stream.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="136">
Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira
mu&s;t never more &s;ee Martin, Martin
&s;hall never again ble&s;s the eyes of In|damora:
Yet why do I &s;ay wretched?
&s;ince my Rival can never po&s;&s;e&s;s my
Lover without me. The pangs that
others feel in Ab&s;ence, from the thought
of tho&s;e Joys that ble&s;s their Rivals,
can never &s;ting thy bo&s;om; nor can
they mortify thee by making thee a
Witne&s;s, without giving thee at the
&s;ame time a &s;hare of their Endear|ments.
Change then thy proceeding,
Indamora; thy Jealou&s;y mu&s;t act a new
and unheard-of part, and promote the
intere&s;t of thy Rival, as the only way
to the enjoyment of thy Lover.</P>
<P>From that moment &s;he &s;tudied by all
methods to advance her Si&s;ter's Amour,
and in that her own. And thus there
appeared in the&s;e three Lovers as ex|traordinary
a Conjunction of Pa&s;&s;ions
as of Per&s;ons: Love had reconcil'd
him&s;elf to his mortal foes, to Philo&s;o|phy
in Martin, and to Jealou&s;y in Inda|mora.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="137">
And now flouri&s;h'd the Amour of
Martin; Succe&s;s even prevented his
wi&s;hes; the Marriage was agreed on,
and the day appointed. Sunday was
the time when Mr. Randal's Ab&s;ence
favour'd their hopes, who never on that
day, omitted taking the fre&s;h air in the
fields: The key of the door he always
took with him. <HI>Crambe</HI> was ready
laid at a convenient di&s;tance, who ac|commodated
them with a ladder of
ropes. The ladder was thrown up, and
the Signal given at the window. Lin|damira
ha&s;ten'd to the Alarm of Love,
when behold a new Di&s;a&s;ter! As &s;he
was getting out of the window, the
weight of her body on one &s;ide, and
that of Indamora's on the other, un|luckily
cau&s;ed them to &s;tick in the mid|way:
Lindamira hung with her coats
&s;tript up to the navel without, and In|damora
in no le&s;s immode&s;t po&s;ture
within. The <HI>Manteger,</HI> who for his
gentlene&s;s was allowed to walk at large
in the hou&s;e, was &s;o heighten'd at this
&s;ight, that he ru&s;h'd upon Indamora
like a barborous Ravi&s;her. Indamora
<PB N="125" REF="138">
cry'd aloud for help. Martin flew to
revenge this in&s;olent attempt, of a Rape
on his wedding-day. The lu&s;tful Mon|&s;ter,
driv'n from our double Lucrece,
fled into the middle of the room, pur|&s;ued
by the valorous and indignant
Martin. Three times the hot Mante|ger,
frighted at the furious menaces of
his Antagoni&s;t, made a circle round the
chamber, and three times the &s;wift-footed
Martin pur&s;ued him. He caught
up the <HI>Horn</HI> of a <HI>Unicorn,</HI> which lay
ready for the entertainment of the cu|rious
&s;pectator, and brandi&s;hing it over
his head in airy circles, hurl'd it again&s;t
the hairy &s;on of Hanniman; who
wrinkling his brown forehead, and
gna&s;hing his teeth in indignation,
&s;toop'd low: The horny Lance ju&s;t
raz'd his left &s;houlder, and &s;tuck into
the tape&s;try hangings. Provok'd at this
the grinning Offspring of Hanniman
caught up the pointed <HI>Horn</HI> of an <HI>An|telope,</HI>
and aim'd a blow again&s;t his un|di&s;may'd
Adver&s;ary. Our heroic Lo|ver,
who held his hat before him like
a &s;hield, receiv'd the weapon full on
<PB N="126" REF="139">
the Crown; it pierc'd the beaver, and
gave a &s;mall rent to his breeches. Then
the human Champion flung with mighty
violence the hinder <HI>foot</HI> of an <HI>Elk,</HI>
which hit the be&s;tial Combatant full
on the nether jaw. He reel'd, but
&s;oon recovering, and his &s;kill in war
lying rather in the clo&s;e fight than in
projectile weapons, he endeavour'd to
clo&s;e with him: Forthwith a&s;&s;ailing
him behind unawares, he clamber'd
up his back, and pluck'd up by the
roots a mighty gra&s;p of hair&mdash;but
Martin &s;oon di&s;mounted him, and kept
him at a di&s;tance. Love not only in|&s;pired
his brea&s;t with Courage, but gave
double &s;trength to his &s;inews; he heav'd
up the <HI>hand</HI> of a prodigious <HI>Sea-Mon|&s;ter</HI>;
which when the chatt'ring Cham|pion
beheld, he no le&s;s furious, wielded
the pond'rous <HI>Thigh-bone</HI> of a <HI>Giant.</HI>
And now they &s;tood oppos'd to each
other, like the dread Captain of the
&s;evenfold Shield and the redoubted
Hector. The Thigh-bone mi&s;s'd its
aim; but the hand of the Sea-Mon|&s;ter
de&s;cended directly on the head of
<PB N="127" REF="140">
the Sylvian Ravi&s;her. The Mon&s;ter
chatter'd horribly; he &s;tretch'd his
quiv'ring limbs on the floor; and eter|nal
&s;leep lock'd fa&s;t his eyelids.</P>
<P>The Lady from the window, like
another Helen from the Trojan wall,
was witne&s;s of the Combat cau&s;ed by
her own beauty. She &s;aw with what
gracefulne&s;s her Hero enter'd the Li&s;ts,
admir'd his activity and courage in the
combat, and was a joyful witne&s;s of
his Triumph: She gave a &s;pring from
the window, and with open arms and
legs embraced the neck and &s;houlders
of her Champion. Our Philo&s;opher
receiv'd her with his face turn'd mo|de&s;tly
from her, and in that manner
convey'd her into the &s;treet. He call'd
a Chair with all ha&s;te, but no chairman
would take her; which oblig'd him
to bear his extraordinary burden till he
found a Coach, in which he carried
her off, and was happily united to her
that very evening, by a Reverend Cler|gyman
in the Fleet, in the holy Bands
of Matrimony.</P>

of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> and the Plead|ings
of the Advocates.</HEAD>
<P>BUT <HI>Neme&s;is,</HI> who delights in tra|ver&s;ing
the be&s;t-laid de&s;igns of
Cupid, maliciou&s;ly contrived the means
to make the&s;e three Lovers unhappy.
No &s;ooner had the Ma&s;ter of the Show
receiv'd notice of their flight, but he
&s;eiz'd on the Bohemian Ladies by a
<HI>Warrant</HI>; and not content with having
recover'd the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, re|&s;olv'd
to open all the Sluices of the
<HI>Law</HI> upon Martin. So he in&s;tantly
went to Council to advi&s;e upon all po&s;|&s;ible
methods of revenge.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point he proceeded on was
the <HI>Property</HI> of his Mon&s;ter, and the
que&s;tion propounded was, <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>An Servi po&s;&s;int invitis Dominis Matrimonium con|trahere?</HI></NOTE><Q REND="inline">" Whe|ther
<PB N="129" REF="142">
Slaves could marry without the
con&s;ent of their Ma&s;ter?"</Q> To this
he was an&s;wer'd in the Affirmative,
but told at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline"> " That  <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>An Servus Matrimonio eximitur a Domini ob&s;equio?</HI></NOTE>
the Marriage did not exempt them
from Servitude."</Q></P>
<P>This put him in no &s;mall hopes of
having Martin added to his <HI>Show,</HI> and
acquiring a property in his <HI>Bodily i&s;&s;ue</HI>
by the Ladies. But his joy was &s;oon
da&s;h'd, when he was inform'd, that
&s;ince Martin was a Free Man, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><HI>An Liberi &s;equuntur conditionem Patris, an Matris?</HI></NOTE>
<Q REND="inline">" The children mu&s;t follow the con|dition
of the Father: or, that in|deed,
if they were to follow that of
their Mother, the Ca&s;e would be the
&s;ame, there being no &s;lavery in Eng|land."</Q></P>
<P>Then his Coun&s;el judg'd it more ad|vi&s;eable
to plead for a <HI>Di&s;&s;olution</HI> of the
<HI>Marriage,</HI> upon the impo&s;&s;ibility of
Conjugal dues in the Wife. But then
the <HI>Canon Law</HI> allow'd a <HI>Triennal Co|habitation,</HI>
which entirely ruin'd this
<PB N="130" REF="143">
Project al&s;o. Be&s;ides it was evident by
the &s;ame Law, that <Q REND="inline">" Mon&s;tro&s;ity could
not incapacitate from Marriage,"</Q>
witne&s;s the Ca&s;e of Hermaphrodites,
who are allow'd <Q REND="inline">" <HI>Facultatem Conjugii,</HI> provided they <HI>make Election</HI> before
the <HI>Pari&s;h Prie&s;t,</HI> in <HI>what &s;ex</HI> they
will act, and take an Oath never to
perform in the other capacity." <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sanchez. Ho&s;tiens. Sylve&s;t.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It was next con&s;ulted whether Mar|tin
&s;hould not be permitted to <HI>take a|way</HI>
his Wife? &s;ince upon his &s;o doing
<Q REND="inline">" he might be &s;ued for a <HI>Rape</HI> upon
the body of her <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> there being
plainly the <HI>four conditions</HI> of a  <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Violentia, Cau&s;a Libidinis, Traductio ad Locum, Mulier hone&s;ta.</HI></NOTE>
Rape."</Q> But then again they con&s;i|der'd,
that Martin might an&s;wer he
claim'd nothing but his own; and if
another per&s;on had fix'd her&s;elf to his
Wife, he mu&s;t not for that cau&s;e be
debarr'd the u&s;e of his Property.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till, upon the &s;ame head of
Martin's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his &s;pou&s;e, a Suit
might be devis'd in the name of Lin|damira,
<PB N="131" REF="144">
on this account; <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><HI>Uxor non tenetur vivere cum viro Concubinam te|nente.</HI></NOTE> That a
<Q REND="inline">" <HI>Wife</HI> was not oblig'd to live with a
<HI>Concubine,</HI> and &s;uch her Si&s;ter Inda|mora
mu&s;t be accounted to Martin
from the common  <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tactus, amplexus, cohabitatio.</HI></NOTE> Proofs."</Q>  To
this too it was reply'd, that the Law
order'd the Wife to <HI>re&s;ide</HI> with the <HI>Hu&s;|band</HI>
if there were &s;ufficient &s;ecurity
given to expel the Concubine. So
Martin might &s;ay he was ready to ac|compli&s;h
his part of the Covenant, if
his wife would perform hers, and con|&s;ent
to the <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><HI>An Uxor tenetur Inci&s;ionem pati?</HI> Sanchez <HI>de</HI> Ma|trimonio.</NOTE> Inci&s;ion. But this be|ing
an impo&s;&s;ibility on the &s;ide of the
Wife, it could no way be exacted of
the Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>At length Mr. Randal, being vext at
the heart, to have been &s;o long and &s;o
quaintly di&s;appointed, determin'd to
commence a Suit again&s;t Martin for
<HI>Bigamy</HI> and <HI>Ince&s;t.</HI> Mean while he
left no Artifice or Addre&s;s untry'd to
<PB N="132" REF="145">
perplex the unhappy Philo&s;opher: He
even contriv'd with infinite cunning, to
alienate Indamora's affections from him;
and debauch'd her into an Intrigue with
a Creature, of his own, the black
Prince; whom he &s;ecretly caus'd to
marry her, while her Si&s;ter was <HI>a&s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn
<HI>Plaintiff,</HI> and commenc'd a Suit in the
<HI>Spiritual Court</HI> again&s;t the black Prince,
for Cohabitation with his &s;aid wife.
He was advis'd to in&s;i&s;t upon a new
Point, (viz.) <Q REND="inline">" That Lindamira and
Indamora <HI>together</HI> made up but <HI>one</HI>
lawful wife."</Q></P>
<P>The Mon&s;ter-ma&s;ter, further to di|&s;tre&s;s
Martin, forc'd Lindamira to pe|tition
for Aliment, <HI>lite pendente:</HI> which
was no &s;ooner allow'd her by the Court,
but he oblig'd her to alledge, that <Q REND="inline">" it
was not &s;ufficient to maintain both
her&s;elf and her Si&s;ter; and if her
Si&s;ter peri&s;h'd, &s;he could not live
with the dead body about her."</Q></P>
<P>Martin now began to repent that he
had not executed a re&s;olution he for|merly
conceiv'd, of marrying <HI>Crambe</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="146">
to Indamora, as an Expedient to have
made all &s;ecure. Moreover, it was in|&s;i&s;ted
on, that the other al&s;o had a
right to <HI>Aliment,</HI> <Q REND="inline">" becau&s;e if Martin's
Wife &s;hould prove with child, the

being impannel'd, declar'd, that as to
Nutrition they were doubtful, whether
any blood of Lindamira circulated
through Indamora: But as to Ge&s;tati|on,
it was evidently true. And upon
this, Martin was order'd to allow Ali|ment
to both, the Black Prince appear|ing
<HI>in&s;olvent.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court proceeded to the
Trial. And as both the Cau&s;e and
the Pleadings are of an extraordinary
Nature, we think &s;it here to in&s;ert
them at length.</P>
<P>Dr. Penny-feather thus pleaded for
Martinus Scriblerus the Plaintiff.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><PB N="134" REF="147"><P>Dr. PENNY-FEATHER.</P>
<P>" I appear before your Honour in
behalf of Martinus Scriblerus, Batch|elor
of Phy&s;ick, in a Complaint a|gain&s;t
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, com|monly
called the black Prince of
Monopotapa; Ina&s;much as the &s;aid
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, hath malici|ou&s;ly,
forcibly, and unlawfully &s;eiz'd,
ravi&s;h'd, and detain'd Lindamira-In|damora,
the wife of the &s;aid Martin,
and the body of the &s;aid Lindamira-Indamora,
from time to time ever
&s;ince, hath wickedly, leudly, and
indecently us'd, handled, and evil
entreated. And in order to make
this his Villainy more la&s;ting, hath
pre&s;um'd to marry this our Wife,
pretending to give his wickedne&s;s the
Sanction of a Law. And fora&s;much
as the Adulterer doth not deny the
fact, but in&s;i&s;ts upon his &s;aid Mar|riage
as lawful, we cannot open the
Ca&s;e more plainly to your Honour,
than by an&s;wering his Rea&s;ons,
which indeed, to mention, is to
confute.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="148">
" He maintains no le&s;s an ab&s;urdity
than this, that <HI>One</HI> is <HI>Two</HI>; and that
Lindamira-Indamora, the individual
wife of the Plaintiff, is not one, but
two Per&s;ons: And that the &s;aid Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
is not marry'd to
Lindamira, the wife of the &s;aid
Martin, but to his own lawful wife
Indamora, another individual Per&s;on
di&s;tinct from the &s;aid Lindamira,
tho' join'd to her by a &s;trong Liga|ment
of Nature."</P>
<P>In an&s;wer whereunto, we &s;hall prove
three things: " <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the &s;aid
Lindamira-Indamora, now our law|ful
wife, makes but one individual
per&s;on." </P>
<P>" Secondly, that if they made two
individual per&s;ons, yet they con&s;ti|tute
but one wife." </P>
<P>" <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that &s;uppo&s;ing they made
two individual per&s;ons, and two
wives, each lawfully marry'd to her
own hu&s;band, yet Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
hath no right to detain
Lindamira our lawfully wedded wife,
<PB N="136" REF="149">
on pretence of being marry'd to In|damora." </P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point: " It will be
nece&s;&s;ary to determine the <HI>con&s;tituent
Principle</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>Individuality,</HI>
which in re&s;pect of mankind, we take
to be one &s;imple identical &s;oul, in
one &s;imple identical body. The in|dividuality,
&s;amene&s;s, or identity of
the body, is not determin'd (as &s;ome
vainly imagine) by one head, and a
certain number of arms, legs, and
other members; but in one &s;imple,
&s;ingle <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or member of Gene|ration."</P>
<P>" Let us &s;earch Profane Hi&s;tory,
and we &s;hall find Geryon with three
heads, and Briareus with an hundred
hands. Let us &s;earch Sacred Hi&s;to|ry,
and we meet with one of the
&s;ons of the Giants with &s;ix Fingers
to each Hand, and &s;ix Toes to each
Foot; yet none never accounted
Geryon or Briareus more than one
Per&s;on: and give us leave to &s;ay, the
wife of the &s;aid Geryon would have
had a good action again&s;t any women
<PB N="137" REF="150">
who &s;hould have e&s;pous'd them&s;elves
to the two other heads of that Mo|narch.
The Rea&s;on is plain; be|cau&s;e
each of the&s;e having but one
&s;imple <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or one member of Ge|neration,
could be look'd upon but
as one &s;ingle per&s;on."</P>
<P>" In conformity to this, when we
behold this one member, we di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the Sex, and pronounce it a
<HI>Man,</HI> or a <HI>Woman</HI>; or, as the La|tins
expre&s;s it, <HI>unus Vir, una Mulier,
une Homme, une Femme, One Man,
One Woman.</HI> For the &s;ame Rea&s;on
Man and Wife are &s;aid to be one
Fle&s;h, becau&s;e united in that part
which con&s;titutes the Samene&s;s and
Individuality of each &s;ex."</P>
<P>" And as where there is but one
Member of Generation, there is but
one Body, &s;o there can be but one
Soul; becau&s;e the &s;aid Organ of Ge|neration
is the Seat of the Soul; and
con&s;equently where there is but one
&s;uch Organ, there can be but one
Soul. Let me here &s;ay without in|jury
to truth, that no Philo&s;opher,
<PB N="138" REF="151">
either of the pa&s;t or pre&s;ent age,
hath taken more pains to di&s;cover
where the Soul keeps her re&s;idence,
than the Plaintiff, the learned Mar|tinus
Scriblerus: And after his mo&s;t
diligent enquiries and experiments,
he hath been verily per&s;uaded, that
the Organ of Generation is the true
and only <HI>Seat of the Soul.</HI> That this
part is &s;eated in the middle, and near
the Center of the whole Body, is
obvious to your Honour's view.
From thence, like the Sun in the
Center of the world, the Soul di&s;|pen&s;es
her warmth and vital influ|ence:
Let the Brain glory in the
Wi&s;dom of the aged, the Science of
the learned, the Policy of the &s;tate&s;|man,
and the Invention of the witty;
the accidental Amu&s;ements and E|manations
of the Soul, and mortal
as the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them! It is to
the Organs of Generation that we
owe Man him&s;elf; there the Soul is
employ'd in works &s;uitable to the
Dignity of her Nature, and (as we
<PB N="139" REF="152">
may &s;ay) &s;its brooding over ages ye
unborn."</P>
<P>" We need not tell your Honour,
that it has been the opinion of many
mo&s;t learned Divines and Philo&s;o|phers,
that the Soul, as well as Bo|dy,
is produc'd <HI>Ex Traduce.</HI> This
doctrine has been defended by argu|ments
irrefragable, and accounts for
difficulties, without it, inexplicable.
All which arguments conclude with
equal &s;trength, for the Soul's being
&s;eated in the Organs of Generation.
For &s;ince the whole man, both Soul
and Body, is <HI>there</HI> form'd, and &s;ince
nothing can operate but where it <HI>is,</HI>
it follows that the Soul mu&s;t re&s;ide
in that individual place, where &s;he
exerts her generative and pla&s;tick
Powers."</P>
<P>" This our Doctrine is confirm'd by
all tho&s;e Experiments, which con|&s;pire
to prove the ab&s;olute Dominion
which that part hath over the whole
Body. We &s;ee how many Women,
who are deaf to the per&s;wa&s;ions of
the Eloquent, the in&s;inuations of the
<PB N="140" REF="153">
Crafty, and the threats of the Im|perious,
are ea&s;ily govern'd by &s;ome
poor Logger-head, unfurni&s;h'd with
the lea&s;t art, but that of making
immediate application to this <HI>Seat
of the Soul.</HI> The impre&s;&s;ions made
by the Ear are &s;o di&s;tant, and tran&s;|mitted
thro' &s;o many windings, that
they lo&s;e their Energy: But your
Honour, by immediately applying
to the Organ of Generation, acts like
a bold and wife Petitioner, who goes
&s;trait to the <HI>very Throne</HI> and <HI>Judg|ment-Seat</HI>
of the Monarch."</P>
<P>" And whereas it is objected, that
here are <HI>two Wills,</HI> and therefore <HI>two</HI>
different <HI>Per&s;ons</HI>; we an&s;wer, if
Multiplicity of Wills imply'd mul|tiplicity
of Per&s;ons, there are few
Hu&s;bands but what are guilty of
<HI>Poligamy,</HI> there being in the &s;ame
Woman great and notorious diver&s;ity
of Wills: A Point which we &s;hall
not need to in&s;i&s;t upon before any
marry'd per&s;on, much le&s;s of your
Honour's Experience."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="154">
" Thus have we made good our fir&s;t
and principal Point; That if the wife
of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamo|ra,
hath but <HI>one</HI> Organ of Genera|tion,
&s;he is but <HI>one individual Per&s;on,</HI>
in the true&s;t and mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e of
Individuality. And that the matter
of Fact is &s;o, we are willing to put
upon a fair Trial by a Jury of Ma|trons,
whom your Honour &s;hall
think fit to nominate and appoint,
to in&s;pect the body of the &s;aid Lin|damira-Indamora."</P>
<P>" <HI>Secondly,</HI> we are to prove, that
though Lindamira-Indamora were
<HI>two</HI> individual Per&s;ons, con&s;i&s;ting
each of a Soul and Body, yet if they
have but one Organ of Generation,
they can con&s;titute but one Wife.
For, from whence can the <HI>Unity</HI> of
any thing be denominated, but from
that which <HI>con&s;titutes</HI> the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> or
principal <HI>U&s;e</HI> of it? Thus, if a Knife
or Hatchet have but one blade,
though two handles, it will properly
be denominated but one Knife, or
one Hatchet; ina&s;much as it hath
<PB N="142" REF="155">
but one of that which con&s;titutes
the E&s;&s;ence or principal U&s;e of a
Knife or Hatchet. So if there were
not only one, but twenty <HI>Suppo&s;ita
Rationalia</HI> with one common Organ
of Generation, that one Sy&s;tem
would only make one Wife. Upon
the whole, let not a few Heads,
Legs, or Arms extraordinary, bia&s;s
your Honour's Judgment, and de|prive
the Plaintiff of his legal Pro|perty:
In which right our Client is
&s;o &s;trongly fortify'd, that allowing
both the former Propo&s;itions to be
fal&s;e, and that there were two Per|&s;ons,
two Bodies, two Rational Souls,
yea, and two Organs of Generation,
yet would it &s;till be plain in the
third place," </P>
<P>" That the Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
can have no Right
to detain from the Plaintiff, his law|fully
wedded <HI>Wife,</HI> Lindamira.
For, ab&s;tracting from the <HI>Priority</HI>
of the marriage of our Client, by
which it would &s;eem he acquir'd a
property in his Wife and <HI>all other</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="156">
<HI>Matter in&s;eparably annex'd unto her,</HI>
it is evident Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
by his marriage to Indamora,
could never acquire any property in
Lindamira; nor can produce any
Cau&s;e why both of them &s;hould live
with him&s;elf, rather than with the
other? Therefore, we humbly hope
your Honour will order the body of
Our &s;aid Wife to be re&s;tor'd to us,
and due Cen&s;ure pa&s;t on the &s;aid
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw."</P></Q>
<P>Dr. Penny-feather having thus end|ed
his Pleading, was thus an&s;wer'd by</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>Dr. LEATHERHEAD.</P>
<P>" I will not trouble your Honour
with any unnece&s;&s;ary Preamble, or
fal&s;e Colours of Eloquence, which
Truth hath no need of, and which
would prove too thin a Veil for
Fal&s;ehood before the penetrating eyes
of your Honour. In an&s;wer there|fore
to what our learned brother, Dr.
Penny-feather hath a&s;&s;erted, we
&s;hall labour to demon&s;trate,"</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="157">
" <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That though there were
but one Organ of Generation, yet
are there two di&s;tinct per&s;ons." </P>
<P>" <HI>Secondly,</HI> That although there were
but one Organ of Generation, &s;o far
would it be from giving the Plaintiff
any right to the body of Indamora,
the wife of Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
that it will &s;ubject the Plaintiff to the
penalty of Ince&s;t, or of Bigamy." </P>
<P>" <HI>Thirdly,</HI> We doubt not to prove
that the &s;aid Lindamira-Indamora
hath two di&s;tinct parts of Generation." </P>
<P>" And <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> we will &s;how, that nei|ther
the individual E&s;&s;ence of man|kind,
nor the Seat of the Soul, doth
re&s;ide in the Organ of Generation;
and this fir&s;t from Rea&s;on. For un|rea&s;onable
indeed mu&s;t it be, to
make that the Seat of the Rational
Soul, which alone &s;ets us on a level
with bea&s;ts: or to conceive, that the
E&s;&s;ence of Unity and Individuality
&s;hould con&s;i&s;t in that which is the
Source of Di&s;cord and Divi&s;ion. In
a word, what can be a greater ab|&s;urdity,
than to affirm Be&s;tiality to
<PB N="145" REF="158">
be the E&s;&s;ence of Humanity, Dark|ne&s;s
the Center of Light, and Fil|thine&s;s
the Seat of Purity?"</P>
<P>" We could from the authority of
the mo&s; eminent Philo&s;ophers of all
ages, confirm this our A&s;&s;ertion; few
of whom ever had the impudence to
degrade this Queen, the Rational
Soul, to the very lowe&s;t and vile&s;t
Apartment, or rather Sink of her
whole Palace. But we &s;hall produce
fill a greater Authority than the&s;e,
to manife&s;t that per&s;onal Individua|lity
did &s;ub&s;i&s;t, when there was no
&s;uch generative Carnality."</P>
<P>" It hath been &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain'd
by many holy Divines (and particu|larly
by Thomas Aquinas) that our
fir&s;t Parents, in the &s;tate of Inno|cence,
did in no wife propagate their
&s;pecies after the pre&s;ent common
manner of men and bea&s;ts: but that
the propagation at that time mu&s;t
have been by Intuition, Coalition of
Ideas, or &s;ome pure and &s;piritual
manner, &s;uitable to the dignity of
their &s;tation. And though the Sexes
<PB N="146" REF="159">
were di&s;tingui&s;h'd in that State, yet
it is plain it was not by parts, &s;uch
as we have at pre&s;ent; &s;ince, if our
Fir&s;t Parents had any &s;uch, they
mu&s;t have known it; And it is writ|ten,
that they di&s;cover'd them not
till after the Fall; when it is pro|bable
tho&s;e parts were the immediate
Excre&s;cence of Sin, and only grew
forth to render them fitter com|panions
for tho&s;e a Bea&s;ts among
which they were driven."</P>
<P>" It is a Maxim in Philo&s;ophy, that
<HI>Generatio unius e&s;t Corruptio alterius:</HI>
whence it is apparent that the Pa|radi&s;aical
Generation was of a dif|ferent
nature from ours, free from all
Corruption and Imbecility. This
is further corroborated by the Au|thority
of tho&s;e Doctors of the
Church who have a&s;&s;erted, that be|fore
the Fall, Adam was endow'd
with a continual uninterrupted Fa|culty
of Generation; which can be
explain'd of no other than of that
<HI>Intuitive Generation</HI> above &s;aid: Since
it is well known to all, the lea&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="160">
&s;kill'd in Anatomy, that the pre&s;ent
(male) part of Generation is utterly
incapable of this continual Faculty."</P>
<P>" We come now to our <HI>&s;econd</HI> point,
wherein the Advocate for the Plain|tiff
a&s;&s;erteth, that if there were two
per&s;ons, and one Organ of Generati|on,
this Sy&s;tem would con&s;titute but
one Wife. This will put the Plain|tiff
&s;till in a wor&s;e condition, and
render him plainly guilty of Bigamy,
Rape, or Ince&s;t. For if there be
but one &s;uch Organ of Generation,
then both the per&s;ons of Lindamira
and Indamora have an equal pro|perty
in it; and what is Indamora's
property cannot be di&s;pos'd of with|out
her con&s;ent. We therefore
bring the whole to this &s;hort i&s;&s;ue;
whether the Plaintiff <HI>Martinus
Scriblerus</HI> had the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> of Inda|mora,
or <HI>not?</HI> If he hath <HI>had</HI> her
con&s;ent, he is guilty of <HI>Bigamy</HI>; if

or <HI>both.</HI>"</P>
<P>" The Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
having been lately
<PB N="148" REF="161">
baptiz'd, hath with &s;ingular mode&s;|ty
ab&s;tain'd from Con&s;ummation
with his &s;aid Wife, until he &s;hall be
&s;atisfy'd from the opinion of your
Honour, his learned Judge, how
far in Law and Con&s;cience he may
proceed: And therefore he cannot
affirm much, nor po&s;itively, as to the
&s;tructure of the Organ of Generation
of this his wife Indamora. Yet
make we no doubt, that it will upon
in&s;pection appear, that the &s;aid Or|gan
is di&s;tinct from that of Linda|mira:
Whereupon we crave to hear
the Report of the Jury of Matrons,
appointed to in&s;pect the body of the
&s;aid gentlewoman."</P>
<P>" And if the Matter of Fact be thus,
give me your Honour's permi&s;&s;ion
to repeat what hath been &s;aid by
the Advocate for the Plaintiff; to
wit, that <HI>Martinus Scriblerus,</HI>
Batchelor in Phy&s;ick, by this his
Marriage with <HI>Lindamira,</HI> could, in
no wi&s;e, acquire any property in the
body of Indamora; not &s;hew any
Cau&s;e why this duplicated Wife
<PB N="149" REF="162">
Lindamira-Indamora, &s;hould abide
with him, rather than with the De|fendant
Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
of Monomotapa."</P></Q>
<P>The Jury of Matrons having made
their Report, and it appearing from
thence that the Parts of Generation in
Lindamira and Indamora were di&s;tinct;
the Judge took time to deliberate, and
the next Court-Day he &s;poke to this
effect.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>" I am of opinion that Lindamira
and Indamora are di&s;tinct per&s;ons,
and that both the Marriages are
good and valid: Therefore I order
you Martinus Scriblerus, Batchelor
in Phy&s;ick, and you Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
Prince of Monomotapa, to
cohabit with your wives, and to lie
in bed each on the &s;ide of his own
wife. I hope, Gentlemen, you will
&s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that you are under
a &s;tricter Tye than common Bro|thers-in-law;
that being, as it were,
Joint Proprietors of one common
<PB N="150" REF="163">
Tenement, you will &s;o behave as
good fellow-lodgers ought to do,
and with great mode&s;ty each to his
re&s;pective &s;i&s;ter-in-law, ab&s;taining
from all further Familiarities than
what Conjugal Duties do naturally
oblige you to. Con&s;ider al&s;o by
how &s;mall limits the Duty and the
Tre&s;pa&s;s is divided, le&s;t, while ye di&s;|charge
the duty of Matrimony, <HI>ye</HI>
heedle&s;sly &s;lide into the &s;in of Adul|tery."</P></Q>
<P>This Sentence pleas'd neither Party;
and Martin appeal'd from the Con&s;i&s;to|ry
to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Arches</HI>; but they con|firm'd
the Sentence of the Con&s;i&s;tory.</P>
<P>It was at la&s;t brought before a <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI>
of <HI>Delegates</HI>; who, having
weigh'd the Ca&s;e, revers'd the Sentence
of the inferior Courts, and di&s;annull'd
the marriage, upon the following Rea|&s;ons:
<Q REND="inline">" That allowing the manner of
Cohabitation enjoin'd to be practi|cable,
(though highly inconvenient)
yet the <HI>Jus petendi &amp; reddendi De|bitum
conjugale</HI> being at all times e|qual
<PB N="151" REF="164">
in both hu&s;bands and both wives,
and at the &s;ame time impo&s;&s;ible
in more than one; Two per&s;ons
could not have a Right to the entire
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame thing, at the
&s;ame time; nor could one &s;o enjoy
his property, as to debar another from
the u&s;e of his, who has an equal
right. So much as to the <HI>Debitum
petendi,</HI> and as to the <HI>Debitum red|dendi,</HI>
<HI>nemo tenetur ad impo&s;&s;ibile.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Therefore the Lords, with great Wi&s;|dom,
di&s;&s;olv'd both Marriages, as pro|ceeding

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Sece&s;&s;ion of <HI>Martinus,</HI> and &s;ome
Hints of his <HI>Travels.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS affair being thus unhappily
terminated, and become the
whole Talk of the Town; Martinus,
unable to &s;upport the Affliction, as well
as to avoid the many di&s;agreeable Con|&s;equences,
<PB N="152" REF="165">
re&s;olv'd to quit the King|dom.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not here neglect to
mention, that during the whole Cour&s;e
of this Proce&s;s, his continual Atten|dance
on the Courts in his own Cau&s;e,
and his invincible Curio&s;ity for all that
pa&s;t in the Cau&s;es of others, gave him
a wonderful in&s;ight into this Branch
of Learning, which mu&s;t be confe&s;t to
have been &s;o improved by the Moderns,
as beyond all compari&s;on to exceed the
Ancients. From the day his fir&s;t Bill
was filed, he began to collect <HI>Reports</HI>;
and before his Suit was ended, he had
time abundantly &s;ufficient to compile a
very con&s;iderable Volume. His Anger
at his ill &s;ucce&s;s caus'd him to de&s;troy
the greate&s;t part of the&s;e <HI>Reports</HI>; and
only to pre&s;erve &s;uch, as di&s;cover'd mo&s;t
of the Chicanery and Futility of the
practice. The&s;e we have &s;ome hopes
to recover, if they were only mi&s;laid at
his Removal; if not, the world will be
enough in&s;tructed to lament the lo&s;s,
by the only one now publick, viz.
The <HI>Ca&s;e of</HI> Stradling <HI>and</HI> Stiles, <HI>in an</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="166">
<HI>Action concerning certain</HI> black <HI>and</HI>
white Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We cannot wonder that he contrac|ted
a violent Aver&s;ion to the <HI>Law,</HI> as
is evident from a whole Chapter of his
Travels. And perhaps his Di&s;appoint|ment
gave him al&s;o a Di&s;-inclination to
the <HI>Fair Sex,</HI> for whom on &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions
he does not expre&s;s all the Re|&s;pect
and Admiration po&s;&s;ible. This
doubtle&s;s mu&s;t be the Rea&s;on, that in
no part of his <HI>Travels</HI> we find him be|lov'd
by any <HI>&s;trange Prince&s;s</HI>; nor
have we the lea&s;t account that he ever
relaps'd into this Pa&s;&s;ion, except what
is mention'd in the Introduction, of the
<HI>Spani&s;h Lady's Phenomenon.</HI></P>
<P>It was in the year 1699 that Martin
&s;et out on his <HI>Travels.</HI> Thou wilt
certainly be very curious to know what
they were? It is not yet time to inform
thee. But what hints I am at liberty
to give, I will.</P>
<P>Thou &s;halt know then, that in his
fir&s;t Voyage he was carry'd by a pro&s;|perous
Storm, to a Di&s;covery of the
<PB N="154" REF="167">
Remains of the ancient <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Em|pire.</P>
<P>That in his &s;econd, he was as happily
&s;hipwreck'd on the Land of the <HI>Giants,</HI>
now the mo&s;t humane people in the
world.</P>
<P>That in his third Voyage, he di&s;|cover'd
a whole Kingdom of <HI>Philo&s;o|phers,</HI>
who govern by the <HI>Mathematicks</HI>;
with who&s;e admirable Schemes and
Projects he return'd to benefit his own
dear Country, but had the misfortune
to find them rejected by the envious
Mini&s;ters of <HI>Queen Anne,</HI> and him&s;elf
&s;ent treacherou&s;ly away.</P>
<P>And hence it is, that in his fourth
Voyage he di&s;covers a Vein of Melan|choly
proceeding almo&s;t to a Di&s;gu&s;t of
his Species; but above all, a mortal
Dete&s;tation to the whole flagitious Race
of <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and a final Re&s;olution
not to give in any <HI>Memorial</HI> to the <HI>Se|cretary
of State,</HI> in order to &s;ubject the
Lands he di&s;cover'd to the <HI>Crown</HI> of
<HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now if, by the&s;e hints, the Reader
can help him&s;elf to a further di&s;covery
<PB N="155" REF="168">
of the Nature and Contents of the&s;e
Travels, he is welcome to as much light
as they afford him; I am oblig'd by all
the tyes of honour not to &s;peak more
openly.</P>

<P>AND here it &s;eems but natural, to
lament the unfortunate End of
the Amour of our Philo&s;opher. But
the Hi&s;torian of the&s;e Memoirs on the
contrary cries out, <Q REND="inline">" Happy, thrice

we end our fir&s;t Book. And here, O Rea|der,
we entreat thee utterly to forget
all thou ha&s;t hitherto read, and to ca&s;t

the fruits of which (if thine, or our &s;ins
do not prevent) are to &s;pread and mul|tiply
over this our work, and over all
the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>In the mean time, know what thou
owe&s;t, and what thou yet may'&s;t owe,
to this excellent Per&s;on, this Prodigy of
our Age; who may well be called <HI>The
Philo&s;opher of Ultimate Cau&s;es,</HI> &s;ince by
a Sagacity peculiar to him&s;elf, he hath
di&s;cover'd Effects in their very Cau&s;e;

Inventor of mo&s;t of the modern Sy&s;tems

<P>He hath enrich'd Mathematicks
with many preci&s;e and Geometrical
<HI>Quadratures</HI> of the <HI>Circle.</HI> He fir&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="171">
di&s;cover'd the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Gravity,</HI> and the
inte&s;tine <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Fluids.</HI></P>
<P>To him we owe all the ob&s;ervations
on the <HI>Parallax</HI> of the <HI>Pole-Star,</HI> and
all the new <HI>Theories</HI> of the <HI>Deluge.</HI></P>
<P>He it was, that fir&s;t taught the right

&s;ometimes of the <HI>Materia Subtilis,</HI> in
re&s;olving the grand Phaenomena of Na|ture.</P>

<P>I &s;hall mention only a few of his
Philo&s;ophical and Mathematical Works.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A compleat Dige&s;t of the Laws

are ob&s;olete or repealed, and of tho&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="172">
that are ready to be renew'd and put in
force.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Mechanical Explication of the
Formation of the Univer&s;e, according
to the Epicurean Hypothe&s;is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An Inve&s;tigation of the Quantity
of real Matter in the Univer&s;e, with the
proportion of the &s;pecifick Gravity of
&s;olid Matter to that of fluid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Micro&s;copical Ob&s;ervations of the
Figure and Bulk of the con&s;tituent
Parts of all fluids. A Calculation of
the proportion in which the Fluids of
the earth decrea&s;e, and of the period in
which they will be totally exhau&s;ted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A Computation of the Duration
of the Sun, and how long it will la&s;t
before it be burn'd out.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. A Method to apply the Force a|ri&s;ing
from the immen&s;e Velocity of
<HI>Light</HI> to mechanical purpo&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. An an&s;wer to the que&s;tion of a
curious Gentleman; How long a <HI>New
Star</HI> was lighted up before its appear|ance
to the Inhabitants of our earth?
To which is &s;ubjoin'd a Calculation,
how much the Inhabitants of the <HI>Moon</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="173">
eat for Supper, con&s;idering that they
pa&s;s a Night equal to fifteen of our
natural days.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. A Demon&s;tration of the natural
Dominion of the Inhabitants of the
Earth over tho&s;e of the Moon, if ever
an intercour&s;e &s;hould be open'd be|tween
them. With a Propo&s;al of a
<HI>Partition-Treaty,</HI> among the earthly
Potentates, in ca&s;e of &s;uch di&s;covery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is
to approximate towards the Earth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. The Number of the Inhabitants
of London determin'd by the Reports
of the Gold-finders, and the Tonnage
of their Carriages; with allowance for
the extraordinary quantity of the <HI>Inge&s;ta</HI>
and <HI>Ege&s;ta</HI> of the people of England,
and a deduction of what is left under
dead walls, and dry ditches.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It will from hence be evident, how
much all his Studies were directed to
the univer&s;al Benefit of Mankind.
Numerous have been his Projects to this
end, of which <HI>Two</HI> alone will be &s;uf|ficient
to &s;how the amazing Grandeur
<PB N="161" REF="174">
of his Genius. The fir&s;t was a Propo|&s;al,
by a general contribution of all
Princes, to pierce the fir&s;t cru&s;t or <HI>Nu|cleus</HI>
of this our <HI>Earth,</HI> quite through,
to the next concentrical Sphere: The
advantage he propos'd from it was, to
find the <HI>Parallax</HI> of the <HI>Fixt Stars</HI>;
but chiefly to refute Sir I&s;aac Newton's
Theory of <HI>Gravity,</HI> and Mr. Halley's
of the <HI>Variations.</HI> The &s;econd was, to
build <HI>Two Poles</HI> to the <HI>Meridian,</HI> with
immen&s;e Light-hou&s;es on the top of
them; to &s;upply the defect of Nature,
and to make the Longitude as ea&s;y to
be calculated as the Latitude. Both
the&s;e he could not but think very prac|ticable,
by the Power of all the Poten|tates
of the World.</P>
<P>May we pre&s;ume after the&s;e to men|tion,
how he de&s;cended from the &s;u|blime
to the beneficial parts of Know|ledge,
and particularly his extraordinary
practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI> From the Age;
Complexion, or Weight of the per&s;on
given, he contrived to pre&s;cribe at a di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ance,
as well as at a Patient's bed-&s;ide.
He taught the way to many mo|dern
<PB N="162" REF="175">
Phy&s;icians, to cure their Patients
by <HI>Intuition,</HI> and to others to cure <HI>with|out
looking on them at all.</HI> He projec|ted
a Men&s;truum to di&s;&s;olve the Stone,
made of Dr. Woodward's <HI>Univer&s;al
Deluge-water.</HI> His al&s;o was the device
to relieve Con&s;umptive or A&s;thmatick
per&s;ons by bringing fre&s;h Air out of
the Country to Town, by pipes of the
nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps:
And to introduce the Native air of a
man's country into any other in which
he &s;hould travel, with a &s;ea&s;onable In|tromi&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch Steams as were mo&s;t
familiar to him; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible
comfort of many Scot&s;men, Laplan|ders,
and white Bears.</P>
<P>In <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> his penetration is
&s;uch, that from the <HI>Picture</HI> only of any
per&s;on, he can write his <HI>Life</HI>; and
from the features of the Parents, draw
the Portrait of any Child that is to be
born.</P>
<P>Nor hath he been &s;o enrapt in the&s;e
Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts
of Painting, Architecture, Mu&s;ick,
Poetry, &amp;c. It was he that gave the
<PB N="163" REF="176">
fir&s;t hint to our modern <HI>Painters,</HI> to
improve the <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> of their Portraits
by the u&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Colours</HI> as would
faithfully and con&s;tantly accompany the
<HI>Life,</HI> not only in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, but
in all its alterations, decays, age, and
death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In <HI>Architecture,</HI> he builds not with
&s;o much regard to pre&s;ent &s;ymmetry or
conveniency, as with a Thought well
worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to
wit, the noble effect the Building will
have to po&s;terity, when it &s;hall fall and
become a Ruin.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> I think Heidegger has
not the face to deny that he has been
much beholden to his Scores.</P>
<P>In <HI>Poetry,</HI> he hath appear'd under a
hundred different names, of which we
may one day give a Catalogue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Politicks,</HI> his Writings are of a
peculiar Ca&s;t, for the mo&s;t part Iro|nical,
and the Drift of them often &s;o
delicate and refin'd as to be mi&s;taken
by the vulgar. He once went &s;o far
as to write a Per&s;ua&s;ive to people to
eat their own Children, which was &s;o
<PB N="164" REF="177">
little under&s;tood as to be taken in ill
part. He has often written again&s;t
<HI>Liberty</HI> in the name of <HI>Freemen</HI> and
<HI>Algernoon Sydney,</HI> in vindication of the
Mea&s;ures of <HI>Spain</HI> under that of <HI>Ra|leigh,</HI>
and in prai&s;e of <HI>Corruption</HI> under
tho&s;e of <HI>Cato,</HI> and <HI>Publicola.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that at his la&s;t departure
from England, in the Reign of Queen
<HI>Anne,</HI> apprehending le&s;t any of the&s;e
might be perverted to the Scandal of
the weak, or Encouragement of the
flagitious, he ca&s;t them all, without
mercy, into a Bog-hou&s;e near <HI>St.
James</HI>'s. Some however have been
with great diligence recover'd, and
fi&s;h'd up with a hook and line by the
Mini&s;terial Writers, which make at
pre&s;ent the great Ornaments of their
works.</P>
<P>Whatever he judg'd beneficial to
Mankind, he con&s;tantly communica|ted
(not only during his &s;tay among us,
but ever &s;ince his ab&s;ence) by &s;ome
method or other in which O&s;tentation
had no part. With what incredible
Mode&s;ty he conceal'd him&s;elf, is known
<PB N="165" REF="178">
to numbers of tho&s;e to whom he ad|dre&s;s'd
&s;ometimes Epi&s;tles, &s;ometimes
Hints, &s;ometimes whole Treati&s;es, Ad|vices
to Friends, Projects to Fir&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters,
Letters to Members of Parlia|ment,
Accounts to the Royal Society,
and innumerable others.</P>
<P>All the&s;e will be vindicated to the
true Author, in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e
Memoirs. I may venture to &s;ay they
cannot be unacceptable to any, but to
tho&s;e, who will appear too much con|cern'd
as <HI>Plagiaries,</HI> to be admitted as
<HI>Judges.</HI> Wherefore we warn the pub|lick,
to take particular notice of all
&s;uch as manife&s;t any indecent Pa&s;&s;ion
at the appearance of this Work, as Per|&s;ons
mo&s;t certainly involved in the
Guilt.</P>
