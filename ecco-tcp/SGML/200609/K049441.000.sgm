<HEAD>A Short View OF The pre&s;ent State OF THE Prote&s;tant Religion in
<HI>BRITAIN,</HI> &amp;c,</HEAD>
<P>I Always ob&s;erved in &s;uch Ca&s;es as this, the only
way to come at a Clear Under&s;tanding of Par|ticulars,
was to go back to their Generals,
to &s;earch the Original of things, and &s;ee from
thence not how they are repre&s;ented, but how they
really are in their meer Nature, and Native Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>In doing this, I &s;hall &s;tudy as much as in me lies,
to give no Offence to any body, nor concern my &s;elf
with any thing, however warmly &s;aid on that Head,
but to my utmo&s;t, keep clo&s;s to impartial Truth in
Fact, and give my own thoughts as calmly as I
can.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Hi&s;torical part may be counted &s;uper|ficial,
and I am content it be &s;o; no body can expect
a &s;uccinct Hi&s;tory of Religion in three Sheets of Paper,
nor &s;hall I, <HI>remote as I am from Books, Vouchers, and
Per&s;ons,</HI> enter into many Quotations, de&s;igning no
<PB N="4" REF="3">
other Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Affairs; but what every Mans
Memory may reflect on, or by very &s;hort reading, be
informed about.</P>
<P>I have no room to &s;pare for Apologies; As I in|tend
no Offence to any one, &s;o I hope, no Man will
take Offence at me, mi&s;con&s;true my Meaning, or cavil
at Mi&s;takes in the manner&mdash;. If they do, if they
will rai&s;e Strife from what is de&s;ign'd for Peace, the
Strife &s;hall be theirs, the Peace &s;hall be mine; and to
all fal&s;e or railing Accu&s;ations, I an&s;wer in the words
of the Text, in the 9<HI>th.</HI> Ver&s;e of the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Jude,</HI>
and no more.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, this whole
I&s;land was under the intire ab&s;olute Dominion of Po|pery;
Rulers and People too much united in following
after Vanity and Idols, and very &s;mall faint Gli|merings
of the Glorious Re&s;urrection of Truth were
then only to be &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> VII. reigning in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> IV. in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> had nothing in them inclining to an Altera|tion
of Religion, but &s;upinely &s;lept&mdash;under the in|vincible
Operation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Opiat: Prie&s;t Craft,
and the Pomp of Religion had dozvd Man-kind, and
that Glorious Light which the Spirit of GOD, by the
Preaching of the Apo&s;tles, had &s;pread thro' the World,
&s;eem'd &s;o overclouded with the Univer&s;al Vail of Su|per&s;tition,
and vile Traditional Performances, that it
look'd as if the General Di&s;pen&s;ation was at End, the
Church of GOD compleated, and the World given up to
Original Blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood here, as if there were
no Appearances in Particular Places and Per&s;ons of a
true Light; For God has never left the Church quite de|&s;olate:
And I know what has been alledged of the <HI>Wal|den&s;es,
Albigen&s;es,</HI> and other &s;uffering Chri&s;tians&mdash;.
But I de&s;ire to be taken as I mean, that a General and
dreadful Darkne&s;s had at that Time over&s;pread the
World, all the Potentates of <HI>Europe</HI> bowed at the Feet
<PB N="5" REF="4">
of <HI>Baal;</HI> and the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Pontiff executed a Tyran|nick
Power without Controul, if there were any Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
of Truth, they behooved to be Confe&s;&s;ors al&s;o;
and what Light appear'd, tho it was received
with Love, it was a Gue&s;t that brought certain
Death with it&mdash;: Indeed the wonderful Power of
the invi&s;ible irre&s;i&s;table Grace of GOD was in nothing
more con&s;picuous, than in furni&s;hing almo&s;t all to
whom he revealed his Truth, with &s;uch a Love to it,
Zeal for it, and Re&s;olution in it, that Per&s;ecution and
Martyrdom were but meer Agents in the Propagation
of Truth; and <HI>Sanguis Martyrum</HI> was at that time more
than ever prov'd to be <HI>Semen Eccle&s;iae.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;uffering po&s;ture the Affairs of the Church &s;tood
at the coming of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to the Crown of <HI>England;</HI>
the fir&s;t part of his Reign gave little Hopes to any that a
Reformation could have its Ri&s;e in a Prince who com|mitted
the Famous <HI>John Lambert</HI> to the Fire, and appear|ed
qualified to be the mo&s;t Famous Per&s;ecutor of Gods
Church that ever was in the World, being in his Conduct
Politick, in his Nature cholerick and cruel, in his Go|vernment
Tyrannical, and in his Religion nothing at
all, but&mdash;what was guided by his Ambition and In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>But
behold how the Divine <HI>Power</HI> is magnified, in
making his Enemies de&s;troy them&s;elves; Pride, Am|bition,
Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the Wrath of Man in this
day, brought to pa&s;s the Glorious and determined De&s;igns
of God, and the Con&s;u&s;ions and Extravagancies of the
World a&s;&s;i&s;ted to open the Eyes of &s;uch who&s;e Hearts
God at the &s;ame time had touch't with His Grace; and
now the Great Light of Truth began to break out be|tween
the Clouds, and by wonderful and various &s;teps
of Providence, too long to relate, All the Mi&s;ts of Dark|ne&s;s,
Ignorance and Super&s;tition fled away, and Truth
in its Native Lu&s;tre &s;hone over the&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>For now <HI>Luther</HI> had broke in upon Error in <HI>Gorma|ny;</HI>
like a Torrent the Kings of the Earth began to hate
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the Whore; and all the Northern Part of <HI>Europe</HI> fell off
from Idolatry, both Princes and People.</P>
<P>The various Turns in <HI>England</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. a|bout
the Article of Divorce, the Regale, and other things,
widned a Breach between him and the Pope;
and tho&s;e lucid Intervals gave &s;uch breathings to the
Reformed Religion, that it advanc't exceedingly, till
even in his Reign, it crept into, fir&s;t his Cabinet, and
then his bed.</P>
<P>In this Cri&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, he &s;trook the two great Preliminary
Strokes at the Root of Popery, in which, tho I &s;ee no
Ground to &s;ugge&s;t, he had any Religious aim, yet Pro|vidence,
who acted him as the In&s;trument, without
giving him the Principle, brought to pa&s;s the End by the
involuntary Agency of what Means he thought &s;it.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Blows at Popery, which I call prelimina|rys,
were ca&s;ting off the Popes Supremacy, and over|turning
the&s;e Seminaries of Filthine&s;s and. Super&s;tition,
the Abbeys and Mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>And here any Body may &s;ee the Rea&s;on of my
going thus far back in this Account, and which per|haps
they might begin to think impertinent to my
purpo&s;e. But the Ca&s;e is this, Had King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Zeal
been for Retormation indeed, or rather had he not
been acted by Pride in one, and Avarice in the other,
that Step had been taken another way, which if it had,
the Snares that have follow'd, had been perhaps pre|vented.
I explain my &s;elf thus.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. been Enlightned by a true Know|ledge,
in proportion to his Circum&s;tance, had his Fury
been a Religious Zeal&mdash;, had he been acted by the Chri|&s;tian,
not the Monarch, when he pull'd down the Su|premacy
of the Pope, he had erected the true Go&s;pel
Supremacy of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and in this unhappy Mi|&s;take,
has been found all the brooding Snakes of Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick
Tyranny, which this part of the World has been
plagued with ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I'll repeat it another way yet plainer, I hope I &s;hall
be excu&s;ed the Tautology.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII, A meer Tyrant, a Man of no Religion
in his in&s;ide, and but very little in the out&s;ide; for
the Tyrant was too rampant in him, to &s;uffer him to
be a Hypocrite, when he pull'd down the Supremacy
of the Pope, immediately &s;et up his own; this was,
I &s;ay, only dethroning one Devil to &s;et up another;
however, the Church was yet Popi&s;h, the Reformation
young, and the Heads of the Reformers were glad to
lay hold of this Handle to pull down what they really
&s;truggled with, as Tyrannical; not fore&s;eeing
that the Tyranny &s;till remained, tho the Ma&s;ters
were chang'd, or that this Mon&s;ter call'd the temporal
Supremacy, was big with future Mi&s;chiefs, which ge|nerating
from one another, would &s;till bring the Church
of God into, at lea&s;t, un&s;criptural Bondage.</P>
<P>But let no Man read this with Prejudice at the Good
Men who were the Agents, who in the &s;implicity of
their Souls, did this, and by it laid the Ax effectually
to the Root of Religious Subjection; and the impious
Ambition of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> If God Almighty for
our Sins, and partly for Puni&s;hment, &s;uffered yet this
<HI>Canaanite</HI> to remain in the Bowels of the Reformati|on,
without doubt he had his Divine Ends in it, which
I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to enquire into.</P>
<P>On this Foundation has however been built, that un|happy
Structure of Divi&s;ion, which has made &s;uch
Cha&s;ms in Gods Church, broke in &s;o much upon
our Charity, and fatally upon our more perfect Re|formation,
even to this Day.</P>
<P>For the Supremacy in Matters Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, being
re&s;olved in the King, began to produce &s;trange Effects,
and &s;ome Martyrs, as they call them, on the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
&s;ide died for denying it, &s;uch as Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI>
Bi&s;hop <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> and others, as in <HI>Burnets</HI> Hi&s;tory of the
Reformation, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. may be &s;een at large.</P>
<P>I &s;hall touch at &s;ome of the Evils, that &s;etting this
Dignity on the head of the Temporal Prince brought
<PB N="8" REF="7">
with it, and the&s;e were two. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That in Matters
indifferent in them&s;elves, the Command of the Civil
Magi&s;trate, has Power to determine us, and make
tho&s;e indifferent things nece&s;&s;ary, and hereon is built
all our Ceremonial, that has &s;ince cau&s;ed &s;uch Divi&s;i|on
in the Prote&s;tant Churches here. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI>
This I give as the Rea&s;on, or rather the Occa&s;ion, that
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church reformed into Epi&s;copacy, and a
Pompous Hierarchy, rather than a <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Pa|rity.</P>
<P>This
is what we mean by the <HI>Regale,</HI> which of
cour&s;e brought the Pontificate along with it, and in
this <HI>Scotland</HI> had the Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> for that
the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> being not in the Direction
of the Prince, but rather in Oppo&s;ition to the Regent the
Queen Mother, the Pomp, the Magnificence, and the
out&s;ide of the Matter lo&s;t all the Reverence it had in
the Court of Princes, where it &s;eem'd to be Carre&s;s't
from &s;ome &s;uitablene&s;s between them in Matters of
Dominion.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> re&s;ign'd this Authority to the
Pope, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was not very ha&s;ty in re|&s;uming
it again, as 'tis plain from <HI>Burnet's</HI> Hi&s;tory of
the Reformation.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' fir&s;t Reform'd, being under
the Reign of a Young King, he was ea&s;ily prevail'd with
to form the Model of Church Government in this man|ner,
as having his Eye more at the main Point, <HI>viz.</HI>
The rooting out of Idolatry and Super&s;tition, but had
not yet had the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy debated, or its
Scriptural Authority call'd in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>As to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &s;he rather went back in the
Reformation of Ceremonies, than foreward in de&s;troy|ing
them; for which two Rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;ign'd by the
Writers of that Age.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Policy, That by the pre&s;erving &s;ome &s;unilitude
to the old Rites, &s;he might, if po&s;&s;ible, bring the Papi&s;ts
to comply with her way, and &s;o prevent a Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
2. Her natural Gayne&s;s of Temper, which enclin'd
her to be much in Love with the Pomp and Shows of
Religion.</P>
<P>In King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, a new and unheard of Do|ctrine
&s;tarted into the World, found fir&s;t in the Heads of
his Flatterers, That Kings were immediatly clothed with
their Power from above, that they Governed <HI>Jure Di|vino,</HI>
and con&s;equently mu&s;t be obeyed as Gods Ordi|nance,
and without any Controul.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not run into the dark Particulars of that
wretched Doctrine, nor the Mi&s;chiefs it brought upon
both Nations; but having a&s;&s;ign'd the proper Original,
both of Prelacy and Ceremonies, the two great things
now debated, I &s;hall proceed to examine what has been
the Con&s;equence of the&s;e things in the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I mu&s;t own they brought immediat Con|tention
into the Reformed Churches, and afterwards
all the Divi&s;ions, Schi&s;ms &s;ome call them, and Debates
that have been in the World, &s;ince their Foundation.</P>
<P>There were indeed early Differences in the Refor|med
Churches in <HI>England,</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper,</HI> and
Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridly</HI> cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ded a little too warmly on both
&s;ides, till Affliction and Suffering taught both of them
more Charity; and when they came both to die for the
E&s;&s;entials of Religion, it taught them to own, the Root
of Religion might be &s;ound, where the Blo&s;&s;om had
not the &s;ame flagrance; that the Faith, Hope, Love,
and other Chri&s;tian Graces might be pre&s;erved, where
they differed in the Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>However, I believe no man will Di&s;pute with me,
that the very Bi&s;hops them&s;elves in tho&s;e Times
were Good Men; of Holy and Blamele&s;s Lives,
&s;ound and whol&s;ome Doctrine; con&s;tant and Labo|rious
in Preaching, of firm and un&s;haken <HI>Faith,</HI> of
invincible Fortitude in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and &s;ealed
the Reformation with their Blood; and tho I am as far
from Epi&s;copacy in my Opinion as any man in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
yet I mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice; the&s;e were Bi&s;hops, of whom
five be&s;ides Arch-Deacon <HI>Philpot,</HI> pa&s;t the Fiery Trial,
and laid down their Lives in the Glorious Cau&s;e of Re|ligion.</P>
<P>The&s;e
were not dumb Dogs, but Zealous Teachers
of the Good People, and having taught Chri&s;t fir&s;t, they
died for him afterwards: A thing ea&s;ier to talk of
than to do.</P>
<P>In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, the <HI>Regale</HI> and <HI>Pontificat</HI>
continuing &s;till in the Church, Bi&s;hops and Ceremonies,
re&s;erv'd their Legal Sanction or Confirmation rather; but
as the World began to encrea&s;e in Knowledge, and Light
&s;pread it &s;elf further than u&s;ual; &s;o People began to
be much out of Love with the Pomp of Service, as with
a thing remote from the true In&s;titution of the Go&s;pel;
and tho &s;everal Acts of Parliament were made again&s;t
them, yet their Number increa&s;ed every Day; the
Queen indeed proceeded very &s;everely with them, to
reclaim them: And King <HI>James,</HI> tho bred up under
another kind of Church Government him&s;elf, carryed it
yet higher.</P>
<P>But as force never yet could be effectual over Religi|on;
&s;o all the&s;e Proceedings &s;erv'd but to make the
per&s;ecuted People encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Original, and I mu&s;t own, I think a mo&s;t ju&s;t Ob|jection
was, that the Church required a yet farther Refor|mation,
that it was their Duty to &s;erve God in the way
which was mo&s;t agreeable to the Scriptures, and they
having di&s;liked &s;everal things in the Ceremonies and
Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed for a greater
Purity of Wor&s;hip: Hence they were called PURI|TANS.</P>
<P>The
Holine&s;s and Blamele&s;sne&s;s of their Lives, the
inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of their Behaviour to all Per&s;ons, and the
General Character they had, was &s;uch, that the
Name fir&s;t given them in Deri&s;ion, was afterwards in
great Honour, both at home, and e&s;pecially among
the Prote&s;tant Churches Abroad; and <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who
<PB N="11" REF="10">
was in <HI>England</HI> at that time, and conver&s;t with them;
gave his Opinion of them in this noble Expre&s;&s;ion,
<HI>Sit anima mea cum Puritannis Anglicanis.</HI></P>
<P>Yet even the&s;e Puritans, than whom Europe never
&s;hew'd better Chri&s;tians, remain'd in the Communion of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in Subjection to <HI>Epi&s;copacy.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on they gave for it was, that tho they
could not join in many things of their Wor&s;hip, yet they
thought it their Duty not to &s;eparate, and make a
Breach or Schi&s;m in the Church.</P>
<P>Note, for I de&s;ire to be rightly under&s;tood, I do
not &s;ay it was their Duty not to &s;eparate, but they
were convinc't of its being their Duty, and &s;o it
might become a Duty to them.</P>
<P>And that it was apparently thus, appear'd afterward,
even that when their Kings put that abominable Book
of Sports upon then, for which all the mo&s;t Godly and
Pious Mini&s;ters were deprived; yet they did not ga|ther
&s;eparate Churches, they went about Preaching,
Catechizing, and In&s;tructing Private Families; but
they neither Baptized nor admini&s;traed the Lords
Supper, but their People Conform'd in that to the e|&s;tabli&s;h't
Church.</P>
<P>If 'tis enquir'd why I ob&s;erve this, 'tis becau&s;e,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I would note with what Force and unwillingne&s;s
the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> have been driven to
be Di&s;&s;enters, and as it were, thru&s;t out of the
Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e of alike backwardne&s;s to &s;eparate, which
appeared at the la&s;t juncture in 1661, which &s;ome
Cen&s;ure the Di&s;&s;enters, I think too &s;everely for.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But to return to the Puritans:</P>
<P>The Government being re&s;olved to pu&s;h them upon
all extremities, and put every thing upon them that
they knew they would not comply with, an Opportuni|ty
offered to try whether it was meerly for the &s;ake
of Per&s;ecution and Oppre&s;&s;ion, that they were thus
<PB N="12" REF="11">
u&s;ed, or whether being really affraid of them, their
General Ab&s;ence would ha' been grateful to them.</P>
<P>For the Di&s;covery of a Planting in the North part
of <HI>America,</HI> called <HI>New England,</HI> happening about this
time, they Petition King <HI>James</HI> for Leave to go over
and plant them&s;elves there&mdash;, which not to enter
here into the Circum&s;tances of their Addre&s;s, or its Re|ception,
tho the Hi&s;tory of it is very diverting, was
granted them.</P>
<P>Immediately the whole Kingdom was in motion,
and nothing was to be &s;een, but hiring Ships, packing
up Goods, &s;elling E&s;tates, Jewels, Hou&s;hold Stuff,
and Equippages, as if the whole Nation was going to
tran&s;plant.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Families that went, met with Terrible &s;e|verity
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">old, Famine, and Want of all things, particu|larly
of Habitations in a barren uncultivated Wilder|ne&s;s;
but what will not People &s;uffer for the Liberty of
their Con&s;ciences? not di&s;couraged by the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es they
went thro', they went on, and were followed by &s;uch
Multitudes, and with &s;uch Wealth, that if I remember
right above 19000 People were found to have gone over
in a very few Years; and &s;o generally were they bent u|pon
it, that the Council had it &s;everal times under de|bate
to &s;top them.</P>
<P>But King James dying, and the Confu&s;ions of the
next Reign coming on, the Civil Wars broke out,
and the Power of the Parliament prevailing, the Princi|ple
before mentioned, of Purity in Wor&s;hip, obtained
on the Nation, Epi&s;copacy was wholly &s;uppre&s;t, and a
New form of Church Government erected.</P>
<P>This not only e&s;tabli&s;h't Liberty to all the Puritans,
and put a &s;top to their flying Abroad, but the Scriptures
with the Pattern of the Primitive Churches, being the
Rule of their E&s;tabli&s;hment, a General A&s;&s;embly of
Divines was call'd, who &s;at at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>&mdash;, what
their proceedings were, how they entertain'd a Bro|therly
Corre&s;pondence with the A&s;&s;embly in this Coun|trey,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
how they unhappily divided again into different
Opinions, the Conte&s;ts about the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of
Church Government, and of their manner in particu|lar;
the&s;e are things too long to enter upon here, and
&s;omething Foreign to my Purpo&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>But to come as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the pre&s;ent Times,
at the Re&s;toration of the Monarchy in King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
this whole Fabrick, &s;o it &s;eem'd good to the Almigh|ty,
fell at once, and the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy, Liturgy,
Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The King, whether &s;incerely de&s;irous to unite his
Subjects, in po&s;&s;ible, or not, is needle&s;s to determine
here, the Con&s;equence be&s;t explain'd his Meaning; but
however, in pretence and out&s;ide he called it, appoints
a Conference at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and granted a Commi&s;&s;ion
to certain on both &s;ides, to treat of an Accommodati|on
of Differences.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters gladly accept of this Conference, and
principally being made to believe that Conce&s;&s;ions be|ing
made on their &s;ide, like Conce&s;&s;ions would be made
on the other, and it might be po&s;&s;ible to prevent a
Breach in the whole.</P>
<P>They then had &s;everal Meetings among them&s;elves,
to con&s;ider how far they might comply, and as they
all thought it their Duty to go as far as po&s;&s;ible: So
the Latitude of &s;ome People went farther than others.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not Ju&s;tifie or condemn here, it is not my
pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;hall readily own &s;ome Men went
farther than any Body of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI>
would go now, and farther than they them&s;elves would
ever after have gone again.</P>
<P>They offered to &s;ubmit to a Superintendency; or
call it what you will, a moderate Epi&s;copacy, and I
&s;hall not di&s;pute with any Man, whether they did not
offer to go higher than is con&s;i&s;tent with a Presby terian
Parity.</P>
<P>They &s;aw that whole Body going to be rent in Pieces;
they &s;aw them&s;elves going to be depriv'd of their Mi|ni&s;terial
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Function, and rendred uncapable of doing the
Good they were dedicated to, and they thought it their
Duty to go as far as po&s;&s;ible to avoid the greater Evils
they &s;aw before them, to them&s;elves, the Church of
God, and the Power of Religion in general.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e that plea&s;e to condemn their Latitude,
take it in what Sen&s;e they think fit, I readily grant all
that is Matter of Fact in their Conce&s;&s;ion, and which
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> has at large given an account of in the Hi|&s;tory
of his Life.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not examine how far the pre&s;ent Body of the
Di&s;&s;enters are affected by it, or are to be cen&s;ur'd for it,
or are any way concern'd in it, and I wave it here for
that Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Conce&s;&s;ions of the Di&s;&s;enters being delivered in,
the King told them, <HI>He was well plea&s;ed they agreed to
the E&s;&s;ence of Epi&s;copacy;</HI> and renew'd his A&s;&s;urances
to them of his earne&s;t De&s;ire of an Accommodation.</P>
<P>What the Treatment they met with from the Church
Party upon the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions was, is very remarkable,
and might put it out of any bodys thought ever to ap|prehend
a Conjunction.</P>
<P>Their Conce&s;&s;ions being rejected, the Mini&s;ters were
immediatly put to the Te&s;t of their Fidelity, and 'tis
remarkable; that of all the&s;e that offered their Con|ce&s;&s;ions,
very few, if any, conform'd; above 3000 of
the be&s;t, mo&s;t Learned, and Pious of the Mini&s;ters,
and who enjoy'd the large&s;t Benefices rejected the Of|fers
of Bi&s;hopricks and Preferment, and quitted their
Livings; becau&s;e they could not comply.</P>
<P>And thus the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy was again re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in <HI>England</HI>&mdash;, &s;everal Per&s;ecutions of the Di&s;|&s;enters
followed in the times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Ri|gour
and Cruelty of which are &s;tanding Te&s;timonies
that they are very far from being Epi&s;copally enclin|ed.</P>
<P>Several
Acts of Parliament have been &s;ince made
to render them as unea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, as the Act of uni|formity,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
I mean the Amendments to it, the five Mile
Act, the <HI>et cactera</HI> Oath, the Sacramental Te&s;t, and
others.</P>
<P>But the Gentlemen on that &s;ide have &s;een their Er|ror,
and even the&s;e we call High-Church Men, are now
forewarde&s;t to make Conce&s;&s;ions to the Di&s;&s;enters, in
order to bring them in to the Church&mdash;, what their
De&s;ign is, he mu&s;t be blinder than I will &s;uppo&s;e any
of my Readers to be, that does not &s;ee; but they do
the Di&s;&s;enters this Service in it, to te&s;tifie for them, that
no Conce&s;&s;ions will now bring them in, but &s;uch as &s;hall
bring the Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline of the Church down to
the Te&s;t of the Scriptures&mdash;, and this farther clears
them of all Su&s;picion of being Epi&s;copally inclin'd.</P>
<P>And thus I have brought the Church of <HI>England</HI> part
of this Di&s;cour&s;e down to the latter Times of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>At his Death the Succe&s;&s;or was a Papi&s;t, and the fir&s;t
Step he took, was to face about to the Di&s;&s;enters, and
by the Glo&s;s of Charity, and General Ju&s;tice, court
them to his Party, giving them Liberty, but on
the foot of his Prerogative, not the Laws, to draw
them into the Snares, of, at lea&s;t, a tacit Acknowledg|ing
his Right to do &s;o.</P>
<P>The Generality of the Di&s;&s;enters &s;aw the hook thro'
this Bait, and tho they accepted their Liberty, and
carryed it dutifully to their Sovereign; yet they pro|fe&s;&s;ed
their Di&s;&s;atisfaction at having it given in an un|parliamentary
manner.</P>
<P>Upon which the&s;e Famous Lines were made which
every Body had in their Prints and Di&s;cour&s;e.
<Q><L>The Declaration's but a <HI>Trojan</HI> Hor&s;e,</L>
<L>The Form's illegal, and the Matter's wor&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some indeed were drawn into the Snares of Addre&s;|&s;ing,
tho they were generally Oppo&s;ed by the be&s;t and
greate&s;t part of the Di&s;&s;enters, and tho&s;e that did it,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
thank't him for the Liberty indeed, yet were ignorant
both in the De&s;ign, and unbelieving in the Con&s;e|quences,
as appear'd in that as &s;oon as their Eyes were
opened, they &s;tarted back, and te&s;tified their Concern
for having been drawn in &s;o far, of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>This al&s;o farther appear'd in that, when the King,
who thought he had gain'd one Point, was for pu&s;hing
at another, <HI>vlz.</HI> the taking off the Penal Laws and Te&s;t;
the Di&s;&s;enters, tho they had &s;uffered &s;o deeply, and
the&s;e Penal Laws were both wicked in their Nature,
and particularly pointed at them; yet they generally
rejected it, and declared they had rather be oppre&s;t by
the Church of <HI>E.</HI> than have both the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and them&s;elves too, torn to Pieces by Popery or
tho&s;e Laws invaded by the di&s;pen&s;ing Power of the
Prince; nor could all King <HI>James</HI> his Booted Apo&s;tles
bring them off from this.</P>
<P>In the Sen&s;e of this the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Di&s;&s;enters made that famous Capitulation, on which the
inviting over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> afterwards the Glo|rious
Re&s;torer of Britains Liberty was built, and which
is expre&s;t in the Eighth Article of the Memorial to that
Prince, on the Performance of which Treaty, the E|&s;tabli&s;hment
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Tolle|ration
of the Di&s;&s;enters are equally built, and &s;uppor|ted
by Right, Truth, and Fundamental Law, and thus
they both &s;tand at this Day.</P>
<P>I come now to the Reformation of the Church of <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
which beginning later than that of <HI>England,</HI> by a|bout
twelve Years, and having no Bonds of Tyranny
upon them, which as I have noted, drew <HI>England</HI> into the
Snare of the Regale; but their Reformation being made
by the People them&s;elves, and Mr. <HI>Jobn Knox</HI> being their
<HI>Calvin,</HI> and who &s;ent or went to <HI>Geneva</HI> on purpo&s;e to
concert the be&s;t Grounds of a National Settlement,
they had nothing impo&s;ed upon them, nor any body
to impo&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
The Lords which headed them, referr'd the whole
Settlement of Religion to the Mini&s;ters, they had the
Mi&s;chiefs <HI>England</HI> was fallen into by a partial and
pompous Reformation before their Eyes, and thus they
reform'd at once into the compleat Model, both as
to Di&s;cipline and Wor&s;hip, which we find at this day.</P>
<P>Nor were they &s;o dark in their Fore&s;ight, as not
to expect all the Rage and Oppo&s;ition the Enemies of
&s;uch a Reformation could be guilty of, and to &s;ecure
the People therefore as far as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;trict Ad|herence
to the mighty Work they were engag'd in,
they contrived the mo&s;t Solemn, Awful and Tremen|dous
Obligation, that I believe, any Nation ever
bound them&s;elves in, &s;ince the Oath of God, which <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI>
made the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> take at Mount <HI>Ho|reb.</HI></P>
<P>This
is what they call the National Covenant, in
which the People bind them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity,
in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to God Almighty, to ad|here
to, maintain and defend to the utmo&s;t of their Pow|er
the Reformation they had &s;ettled, the Doctrine,
Di&s;cipline and Government of the Church, as expre&s;t
in their confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and &s;everal other Articles
both of Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution therein
expre&s;t, needle&s;s, and too long to be repeated here.</P>
<P>This Covenant was made fir&s;t in the Year, 1581. the
new Reformation being then threatned with many E|nemies,
as well Foreign as Dome&s;tick&mdash;, and it was
renewed again, in the Year 1590.</P>
<P>I am far from rai&s;ing the lea&s;t Scruple at, or making
any Reflection upon the Nature, the Can&s;e, the Man|ner,
or Obligation of this Covenant, or any Branch
of it; they that con&s;true me &s;o, do it to cover the
Shame of the other ill Treatment which I have dayly
from them.</P>
<P>I frankly own it a &s;olemn, and almo&s;t ju&s;t Obligation,
and declare I never meant in any thing I &s;aid, or printed,
the lea&s;t Reflection again&s;t it; and 'tis very ju&s;t I &s;hould
<PB N="18" REF="17">
have the explaining my own words.</P>
<P>If what I have &s;aid any where, gives a &s;eeming Re|flection,
I &s;hould be very &s;orry, for the &s;ake of them
that may ignorantly mi&s;take me; as for tho&s;e that
maliciou&s;ly and wilfully mi&s;take me, they are worth
no Hone&s;t Mans Notice, nor is it on their account in
the lea&s;t, that I take notice of it here; but to di&s;abu&s;e
tho&s;e who are impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch.</P>
<P>I freely recognize the National Covenant, and what
I &s;aid in the &s;ixth E&s;&s;ay of our Fathers eating the&s;e
&s;owre Grapes, and us their Children's Teeth &s;et on
edge by them. I wonder any Man &s;hould be &s;o unju&s;t
as to turn my words to a Meaning, That the Covenant
is a &s;owre Grape that &s;ets the Childrens Teeth on Edge.
I therefore declare it to be only brought as an Allu&s;ion to
tho&s;e People who load them&s;elves with more Obligati|ons
in their Notions of the Covenant, than the Cove|nant
really impo&s;es upon them&mdash;, and the Sen&s;e of
the place in which 'tis brought, will allow me this to
any impartial Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I was proving that the National Covenant is not at
all concern'd in the Union; I acknowledge fir&s;t, that
the Covenant is binding to Po&s;terity, and I add, that
for Argument &s;ake, I'll grant; <HI>whether I believe it or
no,</HI> it has all that Obligation they alledge, <HI>let that be
what it will</HI>&mdash;, &s;ignifying thereby, they do reckon
greater Obligations than really are in the Cove|nant,
and this I call eating &s;owre Grapes, 6<HI>th.</HI> E&s;&s;ay,
<HI>P.</HI> 20. and this I leave to any impartial Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>If this be not Satisfaction to any Hone&s;t Man, that I
have not the lea&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect for the National Cove|nant,
I &s;hall on any Rea&s;onable Sentence of indiffe|rent
Judges, make &s;uch more &s;olemn Declaration or
Acknowledgment as they can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Hi&s;tory of the Reformation in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> there was a great Difference in it from what
had been in <HI>England,</HI> for here it was made perfectly,
without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>and contrary to the Intention</HI> of
<PB N="19" REF="18">
the Sovereign&mdash;, and the Regale therefore found no
body to e&s;pou&s;e it, but the Reformers had opportuni|ty
to make their Model as compleat as they could.</P>
<P>I know it has been objected, that in the Infancy of the
Reformation, they found the very E&s;&s;ence of Epi&s;copa|cy
nece&s;&s;ary, and that was in the Superintendents na|med
in the <HI>Church Policy,</HI> one of the fir&s;t In&s;truments of
&s;ettlement devi&s;ed for their Church, the Model of which
had been brought from <HI>Geneva</HI> by Mr. <HI>John Knox,</HI> and
&s;ome have rai&s;ed Pleas from hence for the Prelatick
Power, as the mo&s;t Original In&s;titution, and the like
of the Common Prayers.</P>
<P>But the Bi&s;hops would be ill plea&s;ed to be
no other kind of Bi&s;hops than tho&s;e were, who tho they
had a Dioce&s;s indeed, yet were &s;ubject to be depo&s;ed
by the ordinary Mini&s;ters of their own Bounds, and
therefore I do not bring this to ju&s;tify Prelacy, but to
relate as near as I can, the Fact as it lies, and the U&s;e
of it &s;hall appear pre&s;ently,</P>
<P>The Superintendents indeed had their Dioce&s;&s;es pre|&s;cribed,
<HI>and 'tis call'd by that very name,</HI> and they had
power to plant Mini&s;ters, &s;ettle Churches, and do &s;e|veral
things, which at that time could not be done
without them; but I mu&s;t always in&s;i&s;t upon their &s;ub|jection
as a Clau&s;e that Chocks all the Efforts to prove
the fir&s;t Reformation Epi&s;copal.</P>
<P>However, they were Superintendents, and there|fore
&s;ome kind of Superintendency may not be incon|&s;i&s;tent
with Presbyterian Parity, and thats all the u&s;e
I &s;hall make of it.</P>
<P>I find another in&s;tance of this, which &s;erves the pre|&s;ent
Occa&s;ion, and that is a Letter written in the
Year <GAP DESC="blank"> from the A&s;&s;embly of the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
to the Bi&s;hops in <HI>England,</HI> and in a differing
Stile from what we write here now; the letter begins
thus.</P>
<Q>The Superintendents, Mini&s;ters and Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Church within
the Realm of <HI>Scotland</HI> to their <PB N="20" REF="19"> Brethren the
Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors in <HI>England,</HI> who have renounced the <HI>Roman
Antichri&s;t,</HI> and have profe&s;&s;ed with us <HI>the Lord Je&s;us</HI></Q>
<P>Here is &s;omething very remarkable, and worth
nothing.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> e&s;teem'd, <HI>even the
Bi&s;hops</HI> and Pa&s;tors in tho&s;e days, as Brethren pro|felling
with them the <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> a quite different
Language from tho&s;e who &s;tile them <HI>Dumb Dogs,</HI>
poor <HI>Rogues,</HI> &amp;c. Indecencys, which mu&s;t be of|fen&s;ive
to mode&s;t Ears, were the ca&s;e much wor&s;e
than it is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was as far from owning
Epi&s;copacy it &s;elf then as now, and in the very
Letter, they exclaim again&s;t the Pomp and
Ceremonies of Wor&s;hip; but it did not at all
break off their Charity from the Per&s;ons of the
Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors, whom they &s;till call'd Bre|thren,
and own'd they profe&s;s't with them the <HI>Lord
Je&s;us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Appellation of Brethren <HI>was mo&s;t ju&s;t,</HI> for
that the</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Bi&s;hops in tho&s;e days, tho Prelats, ve&s;ted with Civil
Power, wearing the Habit, and every way practi&s;ing
their Church Power as now, yet were Holy and worthy
Chri&s;tians, and of the &s;ame Cla&s;s with <HI>Cranmer, Ridly,
Latimer, Farrar,</HI> and Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Hooper,</HI> who all of them
&s;ealed the Reformed Religion with their Blood, and
dur&s;t pa&s;s to the Stake, and the Flames in maintaining
the true Prote&s;tant Faith, again&s;t that <HI>Roman Anti|chri&s;t</HI>
here mentioned.</P>
<P>Let no Man &s;u&s;pect me here of favouring Epi&s;copacy;
for tho of late Years, the very Men have been a Scandal
to the Office; yet I profe&s;s were the Bi&s;hops <HI>Now</HI> all <HI>Hoo|pers</HI>
and <HI>ranmers;</HI> I could not agree to their Church Go|vernment:
However, I cannot call it a damning Er|ror;
certainly a Bi&s;hop may go to Heaven, or el&s;e our
want of Charity mu&s;t be great for the Martyrs; I am
<PB N="21" REF="20">
therefore for letting them alone, &s;o far, I mean as re&s;pects
Civil Treatment, and fair U&s;age&mdash;; 'tis enough the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is fenced again&s;t them by Law, and
the Debt of common Civility is due to all the World.</P>
<P>In like manner we find the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> u&s;ing
a Liturgy in former Times&mdash;, I &s;hall not infer that
&s;he ought to be di&s;tru&s;ted on that Score, as likely to re|lapfe
to it.</P>
<P>But this I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that Liturgies unimpo&s;ed,
have always been in u&s;e in the Church, even from the
fir&s;t 300 Years, and therefore are not &s;o Frightful as
&s;ome people make them, and the Directory is a Li|turgy
in its kind; all the Reformed Churches have Li|turgies,
and all that could be de&s;ired in that ca&s;e, by
the Di&s;&s;enters in 1661 was, 1. That they be reformed.
And, 2<HI>dly.</HI> That they be not impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>To prove that a Liturgy and Common Prayer were
u&s;ed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> take the following In&s;tances.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the Church Policy mentioned before, we have the&s;e words, <HI>In
great Towns, we think it expedient, that every day there be either Sermon
or</HI> Common Prayer. And again, <HI>On the day of the Publick Sermon, we do
not think the</HI> Common Prayer <HI>needful to be u&s;ed.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In the Directory for the publick Wor&s;hip in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> we
have this Introduction or Preface;
<Q>"In the beginning of this Ble&s;&s;ed Reformation, our wi&s;e and Pious
Ance&s;tors took care to &s;et forth an Order for redre&s;s of many things,
which they then, by the word, di&s;covered to be vain, erroneous
Super&s;titions and Idolatrous in the publick Wor&s;hip of God&mdash;. <HI>This
occa&s;ioned many Godly and Learned Men to rejoice much in the Book of</HI>
Common Prayer <HI>at that time &s;et forth.</HI>"</Q></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Summ of all this is, not at all to favour either Epi&s;|copacy
or Liturgy in their Attempts to be either ju&s;tified
or re&s;tored in <HI>Britain:</HI> let no Man mi&s;take me, but to do Ju|&s;tice
again&s;t furious Cen&s;ures, who at the &s;ame time, that
the Nations profe&s;&s;ing both &s;orts, are going to unite,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
your to repre&s;ent them as meer Popery or Heathen|i&s;m,
that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> may be the ea&s;ier
Cen&s;ured for offers of Complyance with them, and
this I profe&s;s to be my &s;ingle Rea&s;on for giving the&s;e
In&s;tances; as for tho&s;e who will have me mean what I
never intend, I leave them to their own ways, and
contemn their want of Candour.</P>
<P>'Tis enough the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is reform'd from
this, all the burthens of Ceremony, Forms and Hie|rarchys
are taken away, and Purity in both Wor&s;hip
and Di&s;cipline obtained; but there is a Chri&s;tian Tem|per
and Charity towards the Church of <HI>England</HI> certain|ly
due, who, tho not &s;o far reformed, are yet our Bre|thren,
and of whom we yet hope, and ought to pray
that they &s;hall one day be effectually Illuminated;
this Temper and Charity, I hope, &s;hall now encrea&s;e
on an Union, and that all the Contention &s;hall be to
out-preach, out-live, and out-practi&s;e one another, e|mulating,
and thereby provoking one another to Love
and to Good Works.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the &s;eve|ral
Convul&s;ions &s;he has felt by the Interpo&s;ition of Ty|ranny,
Conque&s;t, and &s;ometimes Epi&s;copacy, are to be
&s;een at large in the Hi&s;torys of both Kingdoms, and I
&s;hall not enter upon them.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ecutions of the Hone&s;t &s;uffering Inhabitants
are a melancholly Te&s;tiwmony of the A&s;&s;aults the Devil
and his Agents have made upon the Reformation here,
the Courage, Con&s;tancy, and vigorous Oppo&s;ition of
the Zealous Confe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t and his Church in this
Nation de&s;erve a better Hi&s;torian, and one le&s;s a Stran|ger
to <HI>Scotland</HI> than I am, to record, and call for more
lei&s;ure, and more room than I have in this &s;mall Tract,
and I therefore leave them with this Remark, That no
Nation in the World has with more Zeal and Fidelity
oppo&s;ed all the Impo&s;itions, Innovations and Barba|rities
of the Enemies of Truth; than this Nation, and
more I cannot &s;ay here.</P>

Under the&s;e &s;uffering Circum&s;tances, they continued,
with &s;ome &s;hort Intervals, till their being incorporated
with <HI>England</HI> in the time of <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> when tho
they &s;eemed to be under a Military Government; yet
they had their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, were
Taxed but in Proportion to the Repre&s;entative; and as
I am inform'd here, their Subjection, &s;uch as it was,
was attended with an Encrea&s;e of Wealth, Trade and
Property.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration, they had Epi&s;copacy, Tranny
and Super&s;tition re&s;tored ju&s;t as in <HI>England;</HI> Mini|&s;ters
that could not conform, turn'd out, &s;ilenced, per|&s;ecuted,
fin'd, bani&s;hed, impri&s;oned <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI>
ju&s;t as in <HI>England,</HI> except only that their Cruelties
and Inhumanities here went farther than they did
there.</P>
<P>Thus they continued till the Revolution, at the
happy coming of the Great Deliverer of the whole
I&s;land, King <HI>WIlliam;</HI> when Tyranny fled, and Guilt
drew in her blu&s;hing Countenance; Law, Truth,
Ju&s;tice and Liberty reviving, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
obtained a Re&s;urrection from a Hundred Years of Mi|&s;ery,
Uncertainty, and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Then Epi&s;copay again vani&s;h't in its turn, and its
Elder Si&s;ter Tyranny, abdicated with her; the Presby|terian
Government of the Church was re&s;tored to its
Primitive Freedom, and to the full Exerci&s;e and Ex|tent
of all its Legal Rights, as it is this day, and thus
far relates to the Hi&s;tory of both Churches.</P>
<P>I come Now to the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> as the

ways concern my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I have deduc't the Di&s;&s;enters from the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> from them they came out, the Rea&s;on of
their di&s;&s;enting, I have confin'd to one Main Head,
<HI>viz. Purity of Wor&s;hip,</HI> which was the fir&s;t; &s;ub&s;equent
Scruples followed indeed, which were levelled at,
what I call the <HI>Regale and Pontificate,</HI> the Supremacy
of Civil Power, and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hierarchy.</P>
<P>The&s;e drove them out of the Church, <HI>and the&s;e only;</HI>
for as to Doctrinal Articles, they are allow'd to be Or|thodox,
and all the Di&s;&s;enters frankly &s;ub&s;cribe them,
the Quakers excepted, and the la&s;t Clau&s;e of the 27<HI>th.</HI>
Article to the Anabapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>It being objected by &s;ome, That <HI>Offers have been
made by the Di&s;senters to come into the Church,</HI> I de&s;ire
to &s;peak directly to it, only to premi&s;e &s;omething
which I think nece&s;&s;ary in this place, relating to the
Church of <HI>England</HI> her &s;elf.</P>
<P>1. The Di&s;&s;enters, in their &s;eparating from the Church
of <HI>England;</HI> do by no means di&s;own her being a true
Church, they charge her with no <HI>Doctrinal Error,</HI>
nothing Heretical or Antichri&s;tian, I mean <HI>as a Church.</HI></P>
<P>2. No Man can be &s;o void of Charity as to judge that
<PB N="25" REF="24">
a Man adhering to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>who&s;e
Con&s;cience is not farther enlightned,</HI> cannot be &s;aved.</P>
<P>3. No Man then can deny, but that the Di&s;&s;enters in
<HI>England</HI> would <HI>gladly come into</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and become one Body with them again, and ought to
do &s;o, would they abate, alter, or remove all tho&s;e
things in which they differ from them, which do not
appear warranted by the Word of God.</P>
<P>This being laid down, it will follow.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That a &s;imple offer of complying with the Church,
can be no matter of Charge again&s;t the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
if the Conditions on which they offer it are
thus qualified.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Tho&s;e that have offered more, are not to be ju|&s;tified,
nor &s;hall not by me; and tho&s;e that have
not, ought not to be condemned for the Mi&s;takes
of their Brethren, and a ju&s;t Di&s;tinction &s;hall be
the Work before me.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I come then to &s;peak to the Matter of Fact, as &s;ome
have alledged it, that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> have
made Offers to conform to the Church of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;;
<HI>I readily grant it is true,</HI> and I think I may as readi|ly
grant all that has been &s;aid upon that Head, which
amounts to this, and no more, That &s;ome of the Di&s;|&s;enting
Mini&s;ters at the Conference at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and
before at <HI>Breda,</HI> willing, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid a Breach,
and keep the Office of their Mini&s;try, did offer to
&s;ubmit to a moderate Epi&s;copacy, or as the King him|&s;elf
call'd it, <HI>owned the E&s;&s;ence of Epi&s;copacy.</HI></P>
<P>I'll grant, that the latitude of &s;ome of their Princi|ples,
and the particular exten&s;ive Charity of others, and
the Circum&s;tances of the whole at that time, carryed
them farther than would con&s;i&s;t with the Presbyterian
Parity now in&s;i&s;ted on by both Churches.</P>
<P>Nay, I'll grant more than is asked, <HI>and I perceive,
more than &s;ome People de&s;ire I &s;hould grant,</HI> viz. That
they went farther than them&s;elves, when they &s;aw far|ther
into it, would afterwards agree to, and a great
<PB N="26" REF="25">
deal more than others of their Brethren, even, at that
time, would comply with.</P>
<P>But I make no que&s;tion to prove here, that there
can be no ju&s;t Argument drawn from hence, to prove
that the Di&s;&s;enters now in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be charged
with the &s;ame Complyance, or di&s;tru&s;ted on the Ac|count
of what then pa&s;t&mdash;. But on the contrary, that
there are very good Demon&s;trations to prove they
would by no means comply with any &s;uch thing; and
that the di&s;&s;enting in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is on the
&s;ame Foundation with one another, and no other.</P>
<P>The Debate therefore of the Complyance in 1661, I
take to be at an end here; <HI>Becau&s;e I grant all that can
be alledged on that head,</HI> I neither Ju&s;tifie nor approve
the Conce&s;&s;ions offered, tho at the &s;ame time the other
Party alledged they were no Conce&s;&s;ions at all, but
what were de&s;tructive to Epi&s;copacy, and, as they
call'd it, a Plot again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I think, That &s;uppo&s;e the Comply|ance
of tho&s;e Men as &s;inful as we plea&s;e, they were
Great and Good Men, they are dead, and gone to their
Re&s;t, and their Works follow them; their Labours
remain &s;tanding Monuments of their Worth and Excellence,
and &s;eem to merit that their Infirmities
&s;hould be buried in the Grave with them.</P>
<P>Let any Mini&s;ter in <HI>Britain</HI> fir&s;t make it appear,
that he has been ble&s;t with being made the In&s;trument
of the Conver&s;ion, re&s;toring and comforting as many
Souls, as Mr. <HI>Baxters Call to the Unconverted,</HI> his <HI>Saints
everla&s;ting Re&s;t,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hows Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the Righte|ous,</HI>
and he &s;hall pa&s;s with me for the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing
of his kind, that God has left us in this Day.</P>
<P>Works of this Value de&s;erve their Savour in the
Hearts of all good Chri&s;tians, and if &s;ome Opinions of
the&s;e Men do not agree with ours; yet Charity ought
to re&s;train our Cen&s;ures of &s;uch Men, as God has made
eminently u&s;eful in his Church, at lea&s;t let us ab&s;tract
the Good, and let the Bad &s;leep, that what we Di&s;like
<PB N="27" REF="26">
may not prejudge the Minds of tho&s;e who may receive
Good from the other.</P>
<P>This I think is a Chri&s;tian way of dealing with
them, and they that reflect mo&s;t upon their own mi&s;car|riages
and failings will be apte&s;t to allow for other
people, the re&s;t is all cavil and indecent.</P>
<P>Having yielded thus to the utmo&s;t, I am now to
prove that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> are not of the &s;ame
Mind now, and would on no account go the &s;ame
length, the Con&s;equence of which will be plain, that they
are not to be Cen&s;ur'd or di&s;tru&s;ted for what was then
done.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my Ab&s;ence from Books and Vouchers in
<HI>England,</HI> deprives me of &s;ome Helps; but I mu&s;t
work with &s;uch Tools as I have; and tho my perfor|mance
may not be &s;o perfect as otherwi&s;e it would
be; yet I hope it &s;hall be convincing, and any mode|rate
Per&s;on will allow for the Di&s;advantage of meer
Memory.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I have living Te&s;timony now in this place,
who have heard mo&s;t, if not all the Di&s;&s;enting Mini|&s;ters
of <HI>England</HI> that have been here, declare in their
own Names, and on account of their Brethren in
<HI>England,</HI> that it is the general Opinion of the Di&s;&s;en|ters
in <HI>England,</HI> That if the Church of <HI>England</HI> would
abate their whole Liturgy, Habits, Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
yet that they could not conform meerly on account of
Epi&s;copacy; and if it &s;hall be of any weight to add my
own Te&s;timony, I declare I have heard them univer|&s;ally
profe&s;s the &s;ame thing in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to come farther, lets take the Te&s;timony of their
Enemies, which is no ill way of coming at a charge;
the Author of the <HI>Regale and Pontificate,</HI> an Eminent
Advocate for the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy in <HI>England,</HI>
charging the Di&s;&s;enters with their rejecting all offers of
Complyance made from the Church, concludes thus,
<HI>'tis impo&s;&s;ible that any Union can be made between the
Church and them; becau&s;e they refu&s;e the REGALE</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
and <HI>PONTIFICATE,</HI> and on this he charges them with
<HI>incurable Schi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Wolff &s;tript,</HI> one of this Countrey
Men, and a great Schollar, inviting, or rather chal|lenging
the Di&s;&s;enters to the &s;tating their Scruples be|fore
the Convocation, in order to a Reconciliation, has
the&s;e words&mdash;. <HI>We &s;hould have little Quarrel with
the Di&s;&s;enters about all the Objections they make as to
Habit, Ceremonies, Liturgy, and even the grand Point of
Ordination by Presbyters, if it was not for their Schi&s;m,
and gathering &s;eparate Congregations, in Oppo&s;ition to the
true Epi&s;copal Authority of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>Here's Liturgy, Ceremonies, Habits, and almo&s;t e|very
thing &s;acrifiz'd to the Di&s;&s;enters, BUT EPIS|COPACY,
and why did they not accept the Chal|lenge;
but becau&s;e the <HI>Main and Material thing</HI> was
behind, without which there could be no Complyance,
<HI>viz.</HI> Epi&s;copal Hierarchy.</P>
<P>What is the Complyance of Mr. <HI>Baxter, &amp;c.</HI> to
the&s;e things? what was then done, is near 50 Years ago,
and the State of things is &s;omewhat altered &s;ince that
time; for 'tis otherways now.</P>
<P>And here I think it will be proper to remind the
Di&s;&s;enters Enemies, or tho&s;e that <HI>di&s;tru&s;t them</HI> on this
account, with that many headed Mon&s;ter call'd A
COMPREHENSION, which &s;ome People&mdash;, <HI>in the
abundance of their Ignorance,</HI> have charg'd the Di&s;&s;en|ters
with contriving.</P>
<P>I believe the Challenge may very mode&s;tly be made
in the Name of all the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> to any Man,
to prove that a Comprehen&s;ion had ever its Ri&s;e a|mong
them, or that any Di&s;&s;enter ever clo&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>I know Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s <HI>Model</HI> was the famous Founda|tion,
and &s;everal Di&s;&s;enters, I believe, at that time,
might have come into that.</P>
<P>But even that Model was far from <HI>a Comprehen&s;ion,</HI>
and when ever the Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">omprehen&s;ion came to be
con&s;idered, and brought down to <HI>the Edge of Practice,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
it was always found impracticable, and therefore the
afore&s;aid Author of the <HI>Regale and Pontificate</HI> declares
an Union between the Church and the Di&s;&s;enters im|po&s;&s;ible;
becau&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters will not come up to E|pi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome People are foreward to tell us there is
a project in <HI>England</HI> now, of making Abatements to
the Di&s;&s;enters to bring them in, I &s;hall give a &s;hort an|&s;wer
to it, if it be to take away the <HI>Regale</HI> and <HI>Ponti|ficate,</HI>
they will accept it, for that is not coming in
to the Church, but receiving the Church in to us; if it
be only as formerly, to abate Rigorous Exacting of
Conformity, I pledge the Value of all I have &s;aid u|pon
it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That 'tis a high Church Project.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Di&s;&s;enters reject it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now, I would fain ask tho&s;e Gentlemen that fear
the Di&s;&s;enters and the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould unite,
who of the Church, the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be mo&s;t like|ly
to join with, <HI>the High Church</HI> or <HI>the Low Church;</HI>
the Low Church-men do not &s;eek it, for they are wil|ling
to give the Di&s;&s;enters all the Liberty and Tole|ration
they de&s;ire, knowing they cannot come in; as
to the high Church, I believe no body will &s;u&s;pect the
Di&s;&s;enters of coming over to them.</P>
<P>But here's another Que&s;tion will be harder to decide
&s;till; How comes it to pa&s;s, that the High-Church
Men quarrel the Low-Church-Men on this Head, and
charge them with &s;hifting the Cau&s;e of the Schi&s;m off
from them&s;elves, telling them, they are not &s;o willing
to yield in indifferent things to the Di&s;&s;enters, as
they are; to prove this the &s;ame Author quoted before,
inviting the Di&s;&s;enters to offer their Demands to the
Convocation, and telling them indifferent things will be
given up to them, has the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And if they will do this, it will &s;oon appear whe|ther
the High or Low Church will go farthe&s;t to pur|cha&s;e
the de&s;ir'd Reconciliation, and which of them
do in mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h for it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
<Q REND="inline">'Next &s;ays the &s;ame Author, Let tho&s;e of the
Low Church, who make &s;uch Boa&s;ts of their Project for
Reconciliation, produce the Terms of it, that it may
appear they were none but indifferent things that were
to be given up, otherways let them too, cea&s;e their rail|ing
at the High Church Men for &s;u&s;pecting them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The High Church de&s;ire that they and the Low
Ohurch may be tryed by their Actions&mdash;</Q>, thus you
&s;ee an Alternative, the Low Church are &s;u&s;pected by
the High Church of giving up all, or giving up none,
and Comprehen&s;ions, Abatements, <HI>&amp;c</HI> are all offe|red
on the High Church Mens &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is plain, they &s;ee an effectual Gate,
to the Ruine of the Di&s;&s;enters in making Divi&s;ion a|mong
them, by yielding in part&mdash;, but are mortally
aver&s;e to giving up the Sub&s;tantial and effectual Arti|cles,
which once removed, would bring an Univer&s;al
Conjunction.</P>
<P>If I am ask't here in General, whether we would on
any terms joyn at all with them. I an&s;wer. and be|lieve
all good Chri&s;tians will an&s;wer, <HI>Yes, with all our
Hearts</HI>&mdash;, and &s;o will the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> too.</P>
<P>And as 'tis natural to &s;ay in the next Que&s;tion, What
are the Conditions, Truely &s;uch as on the Foundation
of which, we would all join with the Papi&s;ts, or any
Church in the World, and I hope, no body will take
Offence at the General way of expre&s;&s;ing it; for 'tis not
&s;tepping foreward, but receiving tho&s;e that &s;tep for|ward
to us.</P>
<P>If any Chri&s;tian Church will abate what is either in
their Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, or Di&s;cipline, not warranted
by the Word of God, I'll readily &s;ay, we &s;hall all join
with that Church. <HI>But to come to Particulars,</HI> as this is
not the fir&s;t time that Que&s;tion has been ask't and an|&s;wer'd,
I'll give five Heads which have been offered
to the Church in this Ca&s;e by the Di&s;&s;enters, and on
which, I believe; the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould &s;oon be one
united Body, and the&s;e are long &s;ince made publick
<PB N="31" REF="30">
in &s;everal Tracts, particularly in an An&s;wer to the
High Church Challenge printed in the Year 1704.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That as to Liturgies, they may &s;uffer &s;uch amend|ment
and Alterations as are ju&s;tifiable by Scrip|ture
and the Practice of the Primitive Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That when they are &s;o amended, they may not be
impo&s;ed, or the Mini&s;ter tyed up, and pre&s;crib'd
by the Letter of the Book, but be at liberty to
enlarge or abridge as his own abilities may &s;up|ply,
or the Ca&s;e require.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That Ordination of Mini&s;ters be e&s;tabli&s;h't in
the Presbyters, and no re-ordination or unrea&s;on|able
Oaths impo&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That Habits and Ceremonies, &s;uch as kneeling
at the Sacrament, bowing at the name of Je&s;us,
the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, the Surplice, Ve&s;tments,
and all the re&s;t, &s;crupled by the Di&s;&s;enters, and
own'd to be indifferent, may be wholly left out,
or left at the Di&s;cretion of the People, as that they
may not be impo&s;ed upon them without their
Con&s;ent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That Church Government be reduced to &s;uch a
pitch of Authority, and ve&s;ted in &s;uch Per&s;ons as
may be ju&s;tified by the Scriptures, and no other.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In all the&s;e Offers, I do not &s;ee the lea&s;t Tendency
towards a Complyance with any thing, either in Di&s;|cipline
or Wor&s;hip, which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
would not agree to, or that can render the Di&s;&s;enters
&s;u&s;pected; I do not &s;ay the&s;e are all the things to be in|&s;i&s;ted
on, and let no Man take that weak hold by the
Barrenne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t a corrupt Meaning;
but I think there is nothing the Church of <HI>England</HI> can
be ask't, but what is contained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">airly in the&s;e Generals.</P>
<P>On the Conceding therefore the&s;e five Heads, the
Di&s;&s;enters, yea, and the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> too, might
very ea&s;ily clo&s;e with the General Union, and become
one great Prote&s;tant, and purely reformed Church,
for it would be one Presbyterian Church.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
Upon the whole, the Matter of Fact I think is plain,
that the grand Difference between the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and the Di&s;&s;enters, at this time, is ju&s;t the &s;ame
as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and no other, I mean Church Govern|ment,
or, in the High Church Language, <HI>the Regale
and Pontificate,</HI> and all the Di&s;pute in both may be
&s;aid to turn upon two Points.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Epi&s;copal Hierarchy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Supremacy of the Civil Magi&s;trate, or his
Power to Impo&s;e Indifferent Things, and thereby to
make them nece&s;&s;ary.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is the Sum of the Matter, and mo&s;t of it lyes in
the fir&s;t Head too; For, were the Hierarchy reduced,
'tis plain, the Church would &s;oon give up the re&s;t:
And, as the Author before Quoted ob&s;erves, <HI>Would
have little Di&s;pute about Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgies
and Ordination;</HI> They are indeed but the Pomp and
Jingle of the other, and the Scripture Rule would &s;oon
reduce them to Primitive Plainne&s;s.</P>
<P>I know the Nicety of the Subject I am writing up|on,
and the want of Charity with which &s;ome will
read, and this forces me to frequent and otherwi&s;e
needle&s;s Excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>I hope I retain an Air of Integrity in my Meaning,
and for Mi&s;con&s;tructions, <HI>e&s;pecially wilful ones,</HI> I de&s;pi&s;e
them: I &s;ee nothing in my Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;hould
make me be &s;u&s;pected of being Epi&s;copally inclin'd&mdash;Tho
I cannot be for Sealing all that are of an Epi&s;copal
Church to Reprobation.&mdash;Nor Treating them as
Antichri&s;tian: I believe the Hierarchy Un&s;criptural,
and enter my publick Prote&s;t again&s;t both <HI>Regale</HI> and
<HI>Ponitificate.</HI>&mdash;And I think this is as much as any
Chri&s;tian can be requir'd.&mdash;But I cannot call the
Church of <HI>England</HI> Antichri&s;tian, becau&s;e neither <HI>Re|gale</HI>
or <HI>Pontificate</HI> are E&s;&s;entials of Doctrine, and when
ever they &s;hall be quitted by them, they are from
that time the &s;ame individual Reform'd Pre&s;byterian
Church with this in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
Some have taken pains to prove, that the Di&s;&s;enters
in <HI>England, I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood of the Di&s;&s;enters,
the Pre&s;byterian Di&s;&s;enters, except where I explain it o|therways,</HI>
declare them&s;elves <HI>now</HI> for moderate Epi&s;|copacy&mdash;. But this can never be prov'd upon them;
Nor does Mr. <HI>Calamy</HI> any where &s;ugge&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, that I re|member,
if he &s;ays <HI>No Body Que&s;tioned the Lawfulne&s;s
of it at the Conference at the Savoy,</HI> it does not amount
to a Proof, that they allowed the Lawfulne&s;s of
it, much le&s;s that they do &s;o now.</P>
<P>But then I find 'tis objected, That they Sign the
37<HI>th</HI> Article of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which Recog|nizes
the <HI>Regale,</HI> or Power of the Civil Authority:
But he that Quotes the Words of that Article, and
leaves out the Explanation with which they Sign it,
does not Act the mo&s;t candid part of a Reconciler,
nor Treat them fairly.</P>
<P>'Tis known, That the Explication is made part of
that Article, and with that Explication the Di&s;&s;enters
are &s;atisfied; and &s;atisfied, that they do not own the
Supremacy of the Civil Power in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Mat|ters,
<HI>farther than all the Prote&s;tant Churches in</HI> Europe <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> this cannot be brought as a &s;ingle Argument
to di&s;tru&s;t the Pre&s;byterian Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>if it be any
Proof at all, 'tis again&s;t the whole Body;</HI> For even
the Anabapti&s;ts Sign that Article, as well as the Pre&s;by|terians,
and no Man ever &s;u&s;pected them of owning the
Supremacy.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly, And which is more than all the re&s;t,</HI> the Church
her &s;elf is come off from the <HI>Regale</HI> in General, and the
Oath of Supremacy formerly impo&s;ed was one of the
fir&s;t things left out of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution at the Re|volution,
the Act for it repealed, and has never been
impo&s;ed upon any Bo-dy &s;ince.</P>
<P>So that I think no Complyance can be charg'd on
the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> upon that Foundation.</P>
<P>I have met with but one thing more, in which the
Di&s;&s;enters are attack't, relating to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that
<PB N="34" REF="33">
is, that they &s;et up for a Toleration of Di&s;&s;enters
there.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I have not the &s;ame formidable Opi|nion
of a Toleration here, as &s;ome Gentlemen have:
And as to the Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters here, I firmly be|lieve,
'tis the true method to di&s;&s;olve and reduce them
to nothing, of which hereafter <HI>but this is nothing to
the ca&s;e;</HI> For I &s;ee no Proof, that the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
have, one way or other, concern'd them&s;elves in
it: And therefore, if any Man charges them on that
Head, it ought to be prov'd; For to &s;ay 'tis &s;o, <HI>as
far as we know,</HI> is only to make it appear, we know but
little or nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>But to offer at &s;omething relating to their Principles
in that ca&s;e, <HI>it may be noted,</HI> 1. that when E&s;&s;ays at
Univer&s;al Toleration have been made in <HI>England,</HI> the
Di&s;&s;enters have always oppo&s;ed them; particularly as
in taking off the Penal Laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts, when they
cho&s;e rather to bear the Unrea&s;onable Burden of tho&s;e
Laws them&s;elves, than to tolerate what was de&s;tructive
to the General Con&s;titution of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>2. Another later In&s;tance is, in a Famous Letter lately
written by Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> to the re&s;pective Heads of the
Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing them to declare their
Opinions of the Univer&s;al Liberty of Chri&s;tians, and
the Toleration of all Opinions <HI>meerly Religious:</HI> The
Original of which Letter I have here with me, <HI>for it
was never printed,</HI> and &s;hall freely &s;how to any Body
that de&s;ires it.</P>
<P>Upon this Application, back't with Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI>
and &s;everal others&mdash;the Di&s;&s;enters meeting and
con&s;ulting about it, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, not to give
any An&s;wer at all to it, or to make any Declaration
of their Opinion on that Head&mdash;. Now if they
have thus refu&s;ed to declare their Opinion in <HI>England</HI>
where accepting Toleration them&s;elves, 'tis mo&s;t like|ly
they &s;hould be for giving it to others, 'tis very un|likely
they &s;hould officiou&s;ly declare them&s;elves for it
<PB N="35" REF="34">
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have nothing at all to do
with it.</P>
<P>However to &s;uch Objectors I refer them to my Opi|nion
of that Matter &s;tated in the Preface to <HI>Jure Di|vino,</HI>
now to be &s;een in this Town, and which I &s;hall
take the Freedom to appeal to.</P>
<P>I think therefore they are free from any of the Re|proaches
thrown on them on that &s;core.</P>
<P>I find but one thing more objected again&s;t them
and that is about their prompting the Di&s;pen&s;ing
Power of the late King in <HI>England,</HI> by their Addre&s;&s;es
of Thanks for an Illegal Indulgence.</P>
<P>This has been directly an&s;wer'd already, and is
briefly &s;um'd up thus,
<Q>Some few Di&s;&s;enters did Addre&s;s and Thank
the King for their Liberty, which, <HI>tho' I do
not, nor ever did approve, becau&s;e that Liber|ty
was their Native Right,</HI> yet as Ignorance,
Good Manners, and Wilingne&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ultivate
the Benefit which they had many Ages
mourn'd for want of, moved &s;ome, and the
prevailing Arts of Court Flatteries others, yet
none of tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es being a real owning
the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, they cannot be di|rectly
charged. And it was plain, they
were not de&s;ign'd as &s;uch by the Addre&s;&s;ers,
&s;ince, as &s;oon as they di&s;cover'd the Fraud,
they all &s;tarted back, and acknowledg'd the
Mi&s;take.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nor can it be argued, as is weakly in&s;inuated,</HI> That
Thanking him for an Indulgence, is a Thanking him for
a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, as that Indulgence was a breaking
in upon the Laws by a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, <HI>becau&s;e the one
was apparent, the other concealed.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;ome were drawn in I owne, <HI>but to what?</HI>&mdash;To
Thank the King&mdash;Well, <HI>what did they Thank him
for?</HI>&mdash;For what was <HI>THE EFFECT</HI> of a Di&s;|pen&s;ing
Power. <HI>Note again,</HI> not for the Di&s;pen&s;ing
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Power it &s;elf, for they did not fore&s;ee it&mdash;. The <HI>HOOK</HI>
Tyranny, was cover'd with the <HI>BAIT</HI> Liberty, <HI>as
in all Ages of the World it has been</HI>&mdash;. And 'tis Di&s;|ingenuous
to charge that Ignorance as a Sin again&s;t
Knowlege, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e as &s;oon as their
Eyes were opened, they corrected the Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Man, with a Villainous De&s;ign to Mur|der
me, makes me a Pre&s;ent of a Poi&s;oned No&s;egay,
I accept his Pre&s;ent, and ignorantly Thank him for
it&mdash;. But I Thank him for the Flowers, I do not
Thank him for the Poi&s;on; But, as &s;oon as I di&s;cover
the Treachery, I throw away the Gift, and pro&s;ecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
the Murderer.</P>
<P>Again, the&s;e People that were thus drawn in, were
but a few, not One to Twenty, <HI>&s;ome &s;ay,</HI> not One
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Fifty, and to charge this on the whole Body, looks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
if the Enemy had a great Barrenne&s;s of Fact, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
wants Charity more than it wants Malice.</P>
<P>But I am told very Schola&s;tically, That &s;peaking
indefinitly does not imply the whole, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>THE DISSENTERS</HI> may mean but a few, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
cau&s;e in School Logic, <HI>an Indefinite in a Matter Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+gent is taken but for a part.</HI></P>
<P>I forbear any Reflection on the Sophi&s;try of this,
the Ca&s;e before us is too hone&s;t to need &s;uch Equivo|cations,
and plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rea&s;on with the help of Fact will
clear it up all.</P>
<P>If, to &s;ay <HI>THE</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>did &s;o,</HI> may &s;ignifie <HI>but
&s;ome of them,</HI> then, if ten Di&s;&s;enters did it, it may be
&s;aid, <HI>The Di&s;&s;enters</HI> did it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, by the &s;ame Rule, if ten th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">+&s;and
did not do it, it may be as truly &s;aid, <HI>The Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
did not do it.</P>
<P>So by this ble&s;&s;ed &s;ort of School Rea&s;oning, it may
be true, and very proper to &s;ay, the Di&s;&s;enters <HI>did it,</HI>
and the Di&s;&s;enters <HI>did not do it,</HI> both at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This is the Art of Rea&s;oning which I confe&s;s my &s;elf
untaught in and when I handle a Cau&s;e that wants it,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
I'll go to School to learn it, but I thank GOD I am
defending a Cau&s;e and a People, who want nothing
but Truth in the plaine&s;t Dre&s;s to defend them, and
a plain Fellow is therefore the fitter to plead for
them.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Chri&s;tian, it makes his
Life all of a piece with his Profe&s;&s;ion, this is the Glo|ry
of the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters, which is like the
People, plain and &s;incere, if they have &s;lipt in any
thing, <HI>Humanum e&s;t Errare,</HI> but they have fallen like
Chri&s;tians to ri&s;e again: And what People in the World
has done it le&s;s? in Thirty Years Oppre&s;&s;ion, they have
&s;tood their Ground, they have upheld the Ju&s;tice of
their Non-conformity, till tyred with per&s;ecuting
them, the very Church that oppo&s;ed them has yielded
to Truth, and complyed with their mo&s;t rea&s;onable
Demands.</P>
<P>To charge the Body for the Mi&s;take of a few, is unju&s;t
and unfair, and yet I dare &s;ay, that the Fact is not
right neither, <HI>viz. That they really own'd the Di&s;pen|&s;ing

<P>I could &s;ay a great deal to defend their General Be|haviour

they de&s;ir'd no Difference in Matters Civil and Neigh|bourly,
I cannot think any Body will cen&s;ure them for

<P>They have defended them&s;elves <HI>again&s;t their Argu|ment,</HI>
but not again&s;t their Per&s;ons, they have kept
their Con&s;ciences, but &s;ubmitted <HI>every thing el&s;e</HI> to
the Civil Government: Nay, they have gone further,
they have not only acquie&s;c'd in the Civil Government

when Popery and Tyranny have invaded the

and if that &s;hould happen, your Po&s;terity will acknow|ledge
it.</P>
<P>Study Peace, Study to be Quiet, and mark &s;uch as
&s;ow Divi&s;ions among you&mdash;; for where there is
Strife and Contention, there is Every evil Work.</P>
<P>For my &s;elf, I &s;hall &s;ay little, I have quitted the ju&s;t
Re&s;entment at un&s;ufferable In&s;olencies, that I might
with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s of Mind, move <HI>Scotland</HI> to
Peace, and practi&s;e the thing I exhort to&mdash;; the Gen|tleman
that oppo&s;es me in this, &s;hall not rally me on|ly
in Print, but he &s;hall trample me under his Feet;
I am content to be all that is contemptible and vile in
his Eyes, and in every Mans el&s;e, if I can but be in|&s;trumental
in the lea&s;t to this ble&s;&s;ed healing Tem|per.</P>
<P>I
can hear him and his Platterers go about defaming
my Morals to le&s;&s;en my Argument, reproaching
<PB N="45" REF="44">
the Man, to weaken his Di&s;cour&s;e, a certain Token of
the &s;terility of better An&s;wers&mdash;. It moves me not&mdash;.
It &s;hall all be in vain&mdash;. Slander and Backbiting
&s;hall do me no Injury&mdash;. I have been an open Re|prover
of other Mens Vices at the extreme&s;t Hazard&mdash;.
<HI>If my own Practice had been &s;candalous,</HI> as the&s;e Men
&s;ugge&s;t, I &s;hould, long &s;ince, have had it Printed in
my Forehead; for this is not the fir&s;t time it has been
attempted. I am &s;orry they force me to &s;ay any thing
in my own Defence, <HI>a mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Triffle to what
I am upon:</HI> But as 'tis done with a De&s;ign to le&s;&s;en the
E&s;teem of what I &s;ay in this Cau&s;e, I am oblig'd to
&s;peak. They report me a Drunkard, a Swearer, a
Sabbath-breaker, and what not&mdash;. Impotent Slan|ders!
what Shift is Malice driven to? The I&s;&s;ue is &s;hort
and plain, and their Hone&s;ty &s;hall be tryed by
it. I challenge them to bring the Man either
here, or in <HI>England,</HI> that ever &s;aw me drink to Exce&s;s,
that ever heard me &s;wear; or in &s;hort, can charge my
Conver&s;ation with the lea&s;t Vice or Immorality, with
Indecency, Immode&s;ty, Pa&s;&s;ion, Prophanene&s;s, or a|ny
thing el&s;e that de&s;erves Reproach; when they can
do this, I'll burn this Book at the Mercat Cro&s;s, and
de&s;ire all the World to regard no more what I &s;ay, and
till they can do it, all Hone&s;t Men will abhor the Pra|ctice.</P>
<P>'Tis
hard, Gentlemen, to force any Man to &s;ay
thus much of his own Character, and &s;o far, as it looks
like O&s;tentation, I ask Pardon for it; I am far from
valuing my &s;elf upon negative Vertue; yet I thank
God that I am able to &s;ay thus much, and thought my
&s;elf oblig'd to convince the World how they are im|po&s;ed
upon, and how a Stranger is treated here; and
I beg the Gentlemen that u&s;e me thus, not to oblige me
to recriminate upon their Morals, which I could do
with too much Advantage.</P>
<P>It wounds every Hone&s;t Man to the Soul, to &s;ee a
Spirit of Bitterne&s;s and Slander gone out among you,
<PB N="46" REF="45">
biting and devouring, and di&s;tru&s;ting one another, at a
time, and in a very Debate of National Union.</P>
<P>I verily believe God in his Providence has determi|ned
the Ble&s;&s;ed Union of the&s;e two Nations; I fore&s;ee
all the Malice of Hell cannot oppo&s;e it; the &s;trange
concurrence of Circum&s;tances points out the Finger of
Providence in every Point of it, 'thas been made up
of Miracle, and unaccountable Junctures in its Periods.
I be&s;eech you Gentlemen, let not your unbelieving
rob you of the Ble&s;&s;ing of it, and adjourn the Comforts
&s;o, that like the Elders at <HI>Samaria,</HI> you &s;hould &s;ee it,
but not ta&s;te of it.</P>
<P>I &s;ee nothing objected but Chimeras, Maybe's, &s;uppo&s;es,
Sugge&s;tions&mdash;, what-ifs, and the like; one convin|cing
Demon&s;tration of the &s;incerity of your Brethren <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>England</HI> will cru&s;h them all, and how will you be a|&s;ham'd
of your Su&s;picions and Jealou&s;ies, how will you
regret the unkind Treatment of your Friends, who
will thus requit you Good for Evil, and heap Coals of
Fire on your Heads,</P>
<P>If you would compare the certain Evils you have a|voided
by it, with the &s;ugge&s;ted Evils that they &s;ay
are in pro&s;pect, there can be no rational Compari&s;on
drawn, Jacobiti&s;m. Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;ion, <HI>French</HI> Tyran|ny,
Popery and War&mdash;, the&s;e are avoided, and mu&s;t
have followed, what can there be before you to equal
the&s;e.</P>
<P>If therefore you have any regard to Ju&s;tice, to Truth,
to your Intere&s;t, to your Religion, Liberty or Po&s;te|rity,
calm your Minds, and fortify your Souls with
peaceable Ideas, leave Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions to ly
a&s;leep in the mi&s;ty heads of the Ignorant; For di&s;tru&s;t
is the Product of a Barren Under&s;tanding, if your Eyes
are open, you cannot but &s;ee your Safety and Pro&s;pe|rity

Without it, all's an empty Shadow, and mu&s;t in

<P>My Friends tell me I lay my &s;elf too low in this and
that the Adver&s;e Party have Ingenuity little enough to
in&s;ult me upon this head; indeed I find little Ingenui|ty
enough in the Party: But when I con&s;ider who they
are, how mean in Character, how &s;eandalou&s;ly few in

their Methods with me, 'tis a compleat Satisfacti|on,
and I am perfectly unconcern'd for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons, who&s;e ill treatment I complain
of are realy contemptible in every part of them; their
Principles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> they are oppo&s;ite to mine, are &s;o to all Ho|ne&s;t
Men, their Reproaches I value not enough to grati|fie
&s;o much as their meane&s;t Expectations; for with me it

and for ju&s;t Matters of Scandal, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">airly defyed
them.</P>
<P>As they are Enemies to God, &s;o they are to the Go|vernment,

the Glory of her Maje&s;ties Government, that it aims
at nothing but what concurrs both with the Glory of

<P>If there was any thing el&s;e in the De&s;ign, I ble&s;s
