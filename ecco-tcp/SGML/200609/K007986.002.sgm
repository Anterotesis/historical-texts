<P>ACCOUNT OF THE Court of <HI>SPAIN.</HI></P>

<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<P>ON the Fea&s;t of the Annunciation, the Young Queen went to the Mona|&s;tery of the <HI>Incarnation.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady accompanied her thither; but tho' &s;he never &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to have an opportunity to entertain her in pri|vate, &s;he could not find one &s;ingle moment to do it; for the vigilant <HI>Camarera</HI> would not al|low the Queen that Liberty. At her return, &s;he &s;erved Nine Poor Women at Dinner, and gave each of them a Suit of Apparel, and &s;ive Pi&s;tols in their Pur&s;e: The Maids of Honour carried the Di&s;hes; the Queen-Mother performed the &s;ame Ceremony on her &s;ide. But what infi|nitely &s;urprized the Queen, was to find a Billet privately &s;lipt into her Pocket, and thus Super|&s;cribed:<Q>For the QUEEN Alone.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">
At fir&s;t &s;he was in doubt, whether &s;he ought to open it or no; but pre&s;ently after &s;he had a mind to carry it to the King: Neverthele&s;s the uncertainty of what was contained in it, and after what manner the King might take it, pre|vailed with her at la&s;t to open it. It &s;eemed to be written in a di&s;gui&s;ed &s;ort of an Hand, and contained the&s;e Words in <HI>Spani&s;h:</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>The Supreme Elevation of your Maje&s;ty, and the mighty difference that is between us, has not been able to efface that Pa&s;&s;ion which your admirable Qualities have infuted into my Heart. I adore you, my Queen; I die in adoring you; and I dare &s;ay, that I am not unworthy to adore you: I &s;ee you, I &s;igh after you; but you don't know my Sighs, you don't under&s;tand my &s;ecret Langui&s;hings; nay, you don't turn your Charm|ing Eyes upon me. Ah, Madam, how unhappy am I to be born a Subject, who find my &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Inclinations of the greate&s;t King in the Univer&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Queen continued &s;ome time &s;urprized and a&s;toni&s;hed: She could not imagine who this Ra&s;h Per&s;on was, that had the hardine&s;s to write to her in the&s;e Terms; and did not que|&s;tion, but that the Billet was &s;lipt into her Pocket by one of the Poor Women whom &s;he had &s;er|ved. But then it appear'd very &s;trange, that a Man, who &s;eem'd to be of great Quality, would tru&s;t his Life (for nothing le&s;s was hazarded) into the Hands of a poor needy Creature; for &s;uch &s;he mu&s;t be that could approach the Queen that day. It was true indeed, that &s;he had been among&s;t the Religious Women of the <HI>Inearnation:</HI> but although &s;ome of them might undertake this bu&s;ine&s;s, yet there was little probability to be
<PB N="3" REF="3">
lieve it, by rea&s;on of the Con&s;equences that would have proved fatal to the Party concerned, if ever the matter came to be di&s;covered. Some|times &s;he thought, that perhaps it might be a Trick of the <HI>Camarera Mayor,</HI> to &s;ee what u&s;e &s;he made of this Billet, and then to acquaint the King with it, and turn the mo&s;t Innocent thing in the World into a wrong &s;en&s;e. After the&s;e different Reflections, at la&s;t &s;he judged it would be the &s;afe&s;t way to di&s;cover the Matter to the Queen-Mother, and follow her Advice. She went the next day to dine with her, and af|terwards &s;hew'd her the Letter, be&s;eeching her to keep it: That if the King came to know any thing of the matter, &s;he would be &s;o kind as to te&s;tify the whole Truth. The Queen-Mother &s;eeing that &s;he was di&s;compo&s;ed at it, a&s;&s;ured her, that it was not worth the while to torment her &s;elf about it; and from whatever Hands the Let|ter came, if the King was di&s;quieted at it, &s;he would take care to acquaint him with the Truth: So that the Queen left her more at ea&s;e than &s;he was before, by rea&s;on of this a&s;&s;urance. On this day the Queen arrived to her Eighteenth Year: She received rhe Compliments of all the Lords, and the Ladies made her Pre&s;ents, particularly the Queen-Mother, who &s;ent her a Sett of Dia|monds and Turquoi&s;es. At Night there was a Con&s;ort of <HI>French</HI> Mu&s;ick at the Palace.</P>
<P>It was much about this time that the Envoy of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> parted from <HI>Madrid,</HI> complain|ing, and loudly threatning them with his Ma|&s;ter's Re&s;entments. He came to receive &s;everal con&s;iderable Sums, which the Elector had &s;ent to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> They had amu&s;ed him a long time with many tedious delays, but at la&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="4">
gave him an A&s;&s;ignation to receive fifty thou&s;and Crowns of the Silver that was daily expected from the <HI>Indies.</HI> When the <HI>Flota</HI> was arrived, he went to <HI>Sevil,</HI> but his Journey had no &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e they had ordered the Pre|&s;ident of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Contration</HI> is a Council where they order all Af|fairs relating to the <HI>Indies.</HI></NOTE><HI>Contration</HI> at <HI>Sevil</HI> to give him nothing. He came back to <HI>Madrid</HI> with all the Fury imaginable, to find him&s;elf treat|ed with &s;o little Re&s;pect: He re|newed his Importunities; and they for their part renewed their Promi&s;es: At la&s;t he was &s;o wea|ried with the&s;e continual Delays, whereby they &s;till put him off, that he demanded a po&s;itive An|&s;wer, and yet tarried longer than he had re&s;olved. But his Ma&s;ter being informed of the whole Pro|ceedings, ordered him to take his Audience of Leave. The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> would fain have &s;topt him, promi&s;ing to pay down fifty thou|&s;and Crowns in four Months: And perhaps the Envoy had &s;tay'd in expectation of them, if he had not been otherwi&s;e ordered, although there was little probability that he would have received &s;atisfaction at the time appointed; and &s;o he re|fu&s;ed this Propo&s;al. Then they offered him thirty thou&s;and Crowns in hand. He was upon the point of accepting them, when he was given to under&s;tand, that this would be paid him no bet|ter than the re&s;t. This put him into a great Pa&s;|&s;ion, which made him &s;peak &s;o fiercely and freely to the Mini&s;ters, that he did not &s;pare them at all. He &s;hew'd &s;everal Per&s;ons a Letter from the Ele|ctor of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> which was full of Menaces, for the rude Treatment of his Envoy. The Night before he parted, they &s;ent him a Golden Chain worth a hundred and fifty Pi&s;tols; but he returned
<PB N="5" REF="5">
it immediately back again to the Per&s;on who brought it to him from the King: The next day the &s;ame Chain was brought to him the &s;econd time; but he &s;ent it back to the Chief Mini&s;ter, and told him, He would rather &s;ay, he had lo&s;t it upon the Road, than accept of a Pre&s;ent that was &s;o unworthy of the Elector his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the Count <HI>de Gubernatis,</HI> En|voy from <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;eeing that all his Solicitations and In&s;tances for four years la&s;t pa&s;t, had not ad|vanced his Negotiation in the lea&s;t; and that all the hopes they gave him of granting the &s;ame Honours to the Mini&s;ters of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as they received in <HI>France,</HI> were only dilatory Illu|&s;ions to amu&s;e him, without ever de&s;igning to perform them; he departed from <HI>Madrid</HI> in a great Fury, which was &s;o much the greater, be|cau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;atisfy his Demands, in the payment of tho&s;e Sub&s;idies that were due to his Ma&s;ter. Some of the other Envoys departed al&s;o with no le&s;s di&s;contents; and as for tho&s;e that &s;tay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d behind, they complained in their turns of the Ill U&s;age they had received. But Foreigners were not the only Per&s;ons that were di&s;gu&s;ted, the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> were little bet|ter u&s;ed; and the Count <HI>de Balbo,</HI> with &s;everal <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> Officers, returned to <HI>Italy,</HI> without being able to obtain what was due to them, or get the Recompence they demanded. It is indeed cer|tain, that the King had no Funds; that the price of Victuals was not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed; that many poor Arti&s;ans and Day-labourers died of Hunger; and that tho&s;e men who were &s;uppo|&s;ed to be rich, had Billets often &s;ent to them to &s;end their Money to &s;uch and &s;uch places, with great Menaces to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate them in ca&s;e they failed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
Another Affair happened, upon which the Court had their Eyes fixt for a long time, and &s;everal Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality found them&s;elves Intere&s;ted in it, by the means of the Prince <HI>d'Stillano,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Monterey.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the place of Pre&s;ident of the Council of <HI>Flanders</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI>; it was taken from him by <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and conferred upon the Count de <HI>Monterey,</HI> who had never taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The pretence they u&s;ed to &s;et by the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> was a quar|rel rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. He had been bani&s;hed, but was afterwards informed under hand, that he might, if he plea&s;ed, come back to <HI>Madrid:</HI> &s;o he fell into the Snare, and returned. The K. and <HI>Don Juan</HI> &s;eemed to be very angry with him, becau&s;e he pre&s;umed to come back, con|trary to his Maje&s;ty's Order; and therefore to puni&s;h him, they be&s;tow'd his place upon the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> who at that time commanded the Army in <HI>Catalenia</HI>; and after this u&s;age were &s;o far from revoking his Sentence, that they bani&s;hed him to his old place. The fir&s;t thing the Count did after he had been &s;ummoned to the Court, was to demand the Oath of his Office, and the King promi&s;ed to chu&s;e a convenient Opportunity to receive him: But the Queen Mo|ther being informed of it by <HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya,</HI> hindered the King from receiving the Oath of the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he had a kind|ne&s;s for the Prince <HI>d'Stillano,</HI> who was altoge|ther devoted to her Service. The Affair conti|nued in this condition, till the Duke <HI>De Medina Celi</HI> was advanced to the Mini&s;try, who a&s;&s;embled a <HI>Juncto</HI> at Cardinal <HI>Portocarero</HI>'s Palace, to ex|amine the Rea&s;ons of one &s;ide and t'other: The
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Cardinal pre&s;ided in it, and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the King's and Qeeen-Mother's Confe&s;&s;ors, by <HI>Don Benedetto</HI> and by <HI>Don Pedro Gil del Faro:</HI> They gave the Prince <HI>de Stillano</HI> to under&s;tand, that &s;ince his Maje&s;ty had di&s;po&s;ed of his Place in fa|vour of the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> he had nothing left him to do, but only to &s;ubmit. To this the Prince an&s;wer'd, That by an ancient Law of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> the King could not take away his Place, without commencing a Proce&s;s again&s;t him. Upon this the <HI>Juncto</HI> broke up, but at their &s;e|cond Meeting concluded, That it was in the King's Power to di&s;po&s;e of this Office, who ha|ving a great Inclination to the Count, had deci|ded it in his advantage. Whil&s;t the Prince <HI>de Stillano</HI> continued thus outed, the Queen-Mo|ther was &s;en&s;ibly concerned at the Inju&s;tice that was done to one of her principal Servants; and &s;he was per&s;waded, as well as the re&s;t of her Family, that they could reproach him with no|thing but his faithful adhering to that Prince&s;s. He &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Demands to have his Tryal come on; That &s;ince they had taken away his Place from him, as from a Criminal, they ought to treat him as one, and puni&s;h him according to his Faults. All the Queen-Mother's Faction joyned in the &s;ame Complaints; but that did not hinder the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> from continuing &s;till in hir Place. It is true, that con&s;idering him Per&s;onally, he was more de&s;erving than the Prince <HI>de Stillano</HI>; that he had faithfully &s;erved the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> when he was Governour there, at a time when Affairs were in a tickli&s;h condition. He is a well-made agreeable Per&s;on, of great Abilities; and we ought to reckon among&s;t his other good Qualities, his Alliance with the
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI>; and this was no &s;mall con|&s;ideration, at a time when the Duke did whatever he plea&s;ed at Court: For Example, he nomina|ted his Brother to be Vice-Roy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which is a Po&s;t where they get a Prodigious Wealth in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of the Council of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> receiv'd about this time a <HI>Breve</HI> from the Pope, whereby he was enjoyn'd to repair immediately to <HI>Rome,</HI> to give an account of his Behaviour towards the <HI>Nuncio</HI>; but they were of Opinion here, that he was not obliged to obey it. It was known at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the Vi&s;itor-General of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> had &s;ent word to the Duke <HI>de Saint-Angelo,</HI> Dean of the Collateral Council, to depart out of <HI>Naples</HI> within three days, and to retire &s;ixty Miles off. He obey'd this Injunction, after having taken his Leave of the Vice Roy, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of the City; and after|wards went to <HI>Gaette</HI> with his whole Family. The Vice-Roy, who appeared in Favour of him, was very glad that the City of <HI>Naples</HI> had writ to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> about him, with a great deal of Zeal and Affection. The Vi&s;itor-General enraged at the Cour&s;e they had taken, &s;ent Or|ders immediately to the Duke <HI>de Monte Sardo,</HI> his Son in Law, to the Duke <HI>Della Regina,</HI> his Ne|phew, and to all his other Relations, to be gone within an hour. The Luke <HI>Della Regina</HI> being a Magi&s;trate of the City, pretended, that he could not be hindered from &s;taying in it. He &s;ummon'd his Friends together, and after he had repre&s;ented to them the Injury that was done to him&s;elf in particular, he declared to them, that the Vi&s;itor had a de&s;ign to attack them too in general, as appeared by his &s;evere
<PB N="9" REF="9">
examining the Conduct of the Princes and Barons of that Kingdom, although by their Priviledges they were exempted from it. 'Twas re&s;olved in this A&s;&s;embly, to meet again the next day; and accordingly a great number of people came there. In &s;hort, there came more than &s;ixty, who ele|cted out of them&s;elves the Prince <HI>Dotojano,</HI> of the Hou&s;e <HI>de Medicis,</HI> the Prince <HI>de la Torella</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Caraccioli,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Matalone,</HI> of the Hou&s;e <HI>de Caraffa:</HI> They went to find out the Vice-Roy, who voluntarily engaged to &s;peak to the Vi&s;itor General; but he coldly told him, That he executed the Orders he had received from <HI>Spain.</HI> Hereupon the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Lords were extreamly di&s;&s;atisfied, and &s;everal of them wi&s;hed, that they had &s;ome Chief or other to head them, who was capable of a great Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of the&s;e <HI>Memoirs,</HI> I ought to acquaint the Reader, That the Am|ba&s;&s;adors, and even the Envoys, had a certain Right at <HI>Madrid,</HI> which exempted them from paying any Toll at the City Gates, for tho&s;e things that were nece&s;&s;ary for their Families. This Cu&s;tom had been ob&s;erved time out of mind; but it being di&s;covered, that &s;ome per&s;ons had extended this Priviledge farther than it ought to be, and that hereby the King &s;uffered exceeding|ly in his Dues; the Council judged it expedient to convert it into a Sum of Mony, which was in effect paid by the Forreign Mini&s;ters, and the <HI>Franquezas</HI> (for &s;o they call this Right) were aboli&s;hed. There was likewi&s;e another Privi|ledge, which is called <HI>Immunidad del Barrio</HI>; that is to &s;ay, the Amba&s;&s;adors have a certain Pre|cinct markt out about their Hou&s;es, in which
<PB N="10" REF="10">
compa&s;s Ju&s;tice is not to be performed without their permi&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>Alcaldes</HI> dare not pa&s;s in the Amba&s;&s;ador's Quarter with their White Rods, which is the Badge of their Authority. Every Amba&s;&s;ador is &s;o jealous to pre&s;erve this Priviledge, that &s;ome Forreign Mini&s;ters have been &s;o hardy as to hang the <HI>Algua&s;ils</HI> at their Gates, when they found them tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing in this point. I mu&s;t confe&s;s very few of them have carried things to this extremity, but &s;everal have ordered them to receive an hundred blows with a cudgel.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the apparent Ri&s;que they run, and the Con&s;equences that &s;uch Infractions might carry, the <HI>Corrigidor,</HI> accompanied with his Officers, pa&s;&s;ed at mid-day through the Quar|ter belonging to our Amba&s;&s;ador: They carried with them their White Rods; but he not being informed of it till they were quite gone, could only &s;end to the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> to tell him, that he was extreamly &s;urpri&s;ed at his procedure, and that for the time to come, he &s;hould remember his Duty better. He an&s;wer'd, That he was ig|norant, till he was now better informed, that the Amba&s;&s;ador's Quarter extended &s;o far as the place through which he had pa&s;&s;ed; and that it was &s;ufficient he knew it now. But notwith|&s;tanding this &s;ort of &s;atisfaction, the very &s;ame <HI>Corrigidor</HI> a few days after came by that way again, and pa&s;s'd before the Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e at a time when he was abroad. The Marquis <HI>de Villars</HI> being informed of it, complained loudly of this In&s;olence.</P>
<P>He expected with Impatience what would be the Re&s;ult of the matter, when an Order from the King came to him, wherein his Maje&s;ty re|voked
<PB N="11" REF="11">
the Priviledges of his Quarter, pretending it was not ju&s;t, that the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould be more favourably treated at <HI>Madrid,</HI> than the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain</HI> was at <HI>Paris.</HI> It was &s;aid at Court, that in that great City the Officers of Ju&s;tice went when they plea&s;ed up to the very Gates of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, to per|form the Functions of their re&s;pective Offices: That in the Year 1671. there was i&s;&s;ued out a Declaration of the &s;ame Nature with this; that the renewing of it was no Novelty, and that &s;ince the fir&s;t Declaration the Amba&s;&s;adors had only enjoy'd this Priviledge by Sufferance, but that for the future they were re&s;olved to connive at it no more.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villars</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he owed too great a re&s;pect to the King, ever to remove him&s;elf from it: That he was a&s;&s;ured the King his Ma&s;ter would approve of the Propo&s;al to treat their Amba&s;&s;a|dor, as they did his in</HI> Spain: <HI>but then they ought to con&s;ider, what Priviledges that Mini&s;ter has at the Court of</HI> France: <HI>That it was not nece&s;&s;ary there to demand Audience and Permi&s;&s;ion, which always retard Affairs, in order to &s;peak to the King and Queen, to &s;ee them, and accompany them; that he went a hunting with the King; that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at Fea&s;ts, and other Ceremonies, as often as he plea&s;ed; that he was al|low'd to have Six Hor&s;es to his Coach, and &s;o to drive all about</HI> Paris: <HI>That the Amba&s;&s;adoris Lady went in the Queen's Coach; that &s;he &s;ometimes Dined with her, and that &s;he received &s;everal Marks of Di&s;tinction, all which &s;erved to make an Emba&s;&s;y pa&s;s very agreeable: That it ought to be con&s;idered, that he did not enjoy all the&s;e Advantages at</HI> Madrid: <HI>And la&s;tly, That he would take care to acquaint his Ma&s;ter with the De|claration of his Catholick Maje&s;ty: That he could not</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="12">
<HI>have an An&s;wer immediately, by rea&s;on of the great di&s;tance; and that it was but rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, that things &s;hould continue in the Old State, till it arrived.</HI> But the King of <HI>Spain</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a Second De|claration, wherein it was &s;aid, That his Maje&s;ty per&s;i&s;ted in his fir&s;t Re&s;olution, and that he thought fit to take away the Immunities of the <HI>Frenco</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Quarter, without a&s;&s;igning any Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed very &s;urpri&s;ing that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villars,</HI> who had rea&s;on to promi&s;e him&s;elf very advantageous Di&s;tinctions upon the Queen's ac|count, &s;hould be the only man, who was &s;ing|led out from the re&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;adors, to have his Franchi&s;es taken away from him, whil&s;t the others enjoy'd theirs as formerly. He did not fail to &s;end Advice to the Court of <HI>France</HI> of what had happened; the King was &s;en&s;ibly concer|ned at his Ill U&s;age, and promi&s;ed to &s;ee Ju&s;tice done to him. But <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> de&s;iring, that things might not be carried to Extremities, neither on one &s;ide nor the other, writ a Letter to the Queen his Daughter, wherein he &s;ignified to her his great Trouble and Inquietude about this Af|fair. He conjured her to u&s;e all her Intere&s;t with the King her Husband, to engage him to do his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty Ju&s;tice. She was kept ignorant till this very moment, of what had pa&s;|&s;ed, and was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than afflicted at it. She took occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e the King about it at a favourable Juncture, as &s;he imagined; but he an&s;wer'd her coldly enough, That it was a long time ago &s;ince this affair had been regula|ted, and that he would di&s;pen&s;e with him&s;elf for telling her the Rea&s;ons. She earne&s;tly impor|tuned him to acquaint her with them; and after
<PB N="13" REF="13">
infinite Sollicitations, he could only be brought to reply as follows:</P>
<P><HI>E&s;que me quiteram e&s;te Embaxador, y me embi|aram otro Gavacho.</HI> Which &s;ignifies in our Lan|guage; <HI>Let them take away this Amba&s;&s;ador from me, and &s;end me another in his room.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to judg, that the King &s;peaking in the&s;e Terms, was not only prejudiced again&s;t the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars,</HI> but al&s;o again&s;t any other that might be &s;ent to him. What&s;oever Intrea|ties the Queen made to oblige him to &s;ettle mat|ters in the E&s;tate they were formerly, yet he con|tinued &s;till inflexible, and &s;eem'd indeed to act in this Affair rather by another Spirit than his own, without making any Reflection, either he or his Council, that <HI>France</HI> would re&s;ent the In|jury.

They had terrible apprehen&s;ions upon them, that he brought a Declaration of War along with him; and the Su&s;pitions they had enter|tain'd a long time from the &s;ide of <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;en&s;ibly alarm'd them. Our Amba&s;&s;ador had Audience of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> to demand the Re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Franchi&s;es, and the Juri&s;|diction of his Quarter. <HI>He repre&s;ented to him the hard&s;hip of his U&s;age, and the little rea&s;on they had to treat him after this manner, and to choo&s;e him from among&s;t the re&s;t to be affronted: That the King his Ma&s;ter was never the Aggre&s;&s;or, but that he would not tamely &s;uffer an Injury, without revenging it: That particularly he was &s;en&s;ible of this, and demanded pub|lick &s;atisfaction for it.</HI></P>

<P>To this the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> made An&s;wer; <HI>That in&s;tead of finding any particular Satisfaction for him&s;elf, he met with a new &s;ubject of Complaint, upon the &s;core of this General Conduct; That &s;ince the new Alliance that was contracted between the Two Crowns, the Natural Right warranted him to expect that the Amba&s;&s;adors of one would ea&s;ily merit Favours of the other, and even procure them for their Friends; that he was &s;o far from meeting that U&s;age, that he could get nothing for them but affronts; but that this was not the thing he demanded: That as for the Declara|tion of</HI> 16-1. <HI>he was not obliged to take the lea&s;t notice of it, &s;ince having been Amba&s;&s;ador at</HI> Madrid<HI>, near four years ago, he peaceably enjoy'd all tho&s;e Privi|ledges, which now they de&s;ign to retrench him of, under the pretence of that Declaration.</HI></P>
<P>He was not content with di&s;cour&s;ing the Chief Mini&s;ter about this Affair, but demanded Audi|ence of the King, and immediately obtained it.

had an important occa&s;ion to do it, and after|wards to abandon them with an Ea&s;ine&s;s, which may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be attributed to their great Weakne&s;s; but there are &s;ome places where this Conduct is more in Reque&s;t than others, and the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> is one of them. Some per|&s;ons were even per&s;waded, that this de&s;ign of taking away the Amba&s;&s;ador's Priviledges, was executed by the Mini&s;ters, only out of a Princi|ple of Revenge, becau&s;e our King had &s;ent word to the Duke <HI>de Giovenezzo,</HI> that he was willing to give him at his Court all the Advantages that belonged to the Character of the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain,</HI> wherewith he was inve&s;ted; but that he had no Intention to leave him tho&s;e Liberties which he allowed to others. And he had a par|ticular Rea&s;on to ob&s;erve this Conduct with him; for it is very well-known, that when he was in the Quality of Envoy at the Court of <HI>Savoy,</HI> he had bu&s;ied him&s;elf, without any pro|vocation, to put them upon the De&s;ign of burning the Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Toulon,</HI> and the Magazines of <HI>Pig|nerol:</HI> So that the King having very ju&s;t Rea&s;ons to look upon him as a particular Enemy, it was Natural enough to deny him tho&s;e Favours that are allowed to tho&s;e Per&s;ons for whom we have an E&s;teem. However it was if the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> was at the bottom mortified at this matter, they took care not to make it appear; and to take away from our King an Amba&s;&s;ador who was by no means agreeable to him, they imme|diately named the Marque&s;s <HI>de la Fuente</HI> to go and &s;upply his Place. The Queen was extreme|ly &s;atisfied to &s;ee the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Franchi&s;es terminate as &s;he de&s;ired.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
The King, who loved her tenderly, notwith|&s;tanding all tho&s;e &s;ecret Enemies that did her ill Services with him, knowing that one of her greate&s;t Diver&s;ions was to ride a hunting, order|ed Three fine Hor&s;es to be brought to her from <HI>Andalu&s;ia.</HI> She cho&s;e one of the mo&s;t mettle&s;ome, and mounted him; but &s;he was no &s;ooner got upon his back, but he began to caper, and was very like to have thrown him&s;elf backwards upon her, when &s;he fell: One of her Feet un|luckily happened to hang in the Stirrup, and the Hor&s;e finding this Embarras, ran about very furiou&s;ly, and dragged the poor Queen after him, to the extream peril of her Life. This Accident happen'd in the Court of the Palace. The King beholding her from a Balcony, was brought to the la&s;t De&s;pair; And though the Court was full of Per&s;ons of Quality, and the Guards, yet no one dur&s;t offer to go and help the Queen, becau&s;e it is not lawful for any body to touch her, and e&s;pecially by the Feet, unle&s;s it be the Chief of her <HI>Menins,</HI> or Pages, who puts on her Chiopins: The&s;e are a &s;ort of San|dals, into which the Ladies put their Shooes, and make them appear very tall. The Queen always &s;upports her &s;elf upon one of her <HI>Menins,</HI> when &s;he walks any where; but the&s;e were Children too &s;mall to re&s;cue her from the danger wherein &s;he was.

Joynt in doing her this piece of Service: But without tarrying a moment, away they went to their Hou&s;es, and pre&s;ently ordered their Hor&s;es to be &s;addled, to e&s;cape the King's Indignation. The Young Count <HI>de Pannaranda,</HI> who was a Friend to both of them, approached the Queen, and told her very re&s;pectfully, That tho&s;e Gen|tlemen who had been &s;o happy as to &s;ave her Life, were yet in fear of lo&s;ing their own. She had the Goodne&s;s to &s;peak to the King in their favour, becau&s;e, as I mentioned before, no body was permitted to touch her, and particularly by the Feet. The King, who came down imme|diately, to &s;ee in what a condition &s;he was, te|&s;tified an extraordinary Joy to find &s;he was not hurt, and very kindly received the Reque&s;t &s;he made in behalf of the&s;e Generous Criminals. Word was immediately &s;ent to them, who by this time were got on Hor&s;e-back to &s;ave them|&s;elves: The Queen honoured them with a Pre|&s;ent, and ever after had a particular Con&s;idera|tion for them.</P>
<P>A few days after this Accident had befallen the Young Queen, &s;he received a &s;mall di&s;gu&s;t from the King upon this occa&s;ion: She had a very pretty Spaniel with her, and the little Crea|ture u&s;ed to lie with her a Nights. The Queen happening to mi&s;s her one Night got out of her Bed, and groped up and down the Room for her; the King too finding the Queen was not in Bed, got up likewi&s;e to find her. Behold them now in the mid&s;t of a great Chamber, without any Light, going on one &s;ide and t'other, and rubbing their Shins again&s;t every thing they met; At la&s;t, the King being impatient, asked the Queen, Why &s;he got up? the Queen an&s;we|red

him, To &s;earch for her Spaniel: <HI>And is it worth the while,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for a King and Queen of</HI> Spain <HI>to ri&s;e out of their Beds, to find a little pitiful Bitch?</HI> Being thus vexed, he &s;purned the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">reature with his Foot, as &s;he came again&s;t his Legs, and was like to kill it. At the Cries &s;he made, the Queen, who loved the Bitch, could not forbear to complain in a &s;weet man|ner, and came to bed again very &s;orrowful; but neither the King nor &s;he were able to find it again; and they were forced to call up the Queen's Women to bring them a Light. The next Morning the King went out very early a hunting all alone, without &s;aying a word to the Queen. This di&s;quieted her all day long, and &s;he pa&s;t the greate&s;t part of it leaning upon the Windows of her Chamber, although the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> frequently di&s;turbed her, and told her, <HI>That a Queen of</HI> Spain <HI>ought not to look out at a Window.</HI> All that day &s;he impatiently expected the King's return, and as &s;oon as ever he lighted from his Hor&s;e, met him about half the Stair-Ca&s;e, and threw her &s;elf about his Neck, with that agreeable <HI>French</HI> Liberty, which &s;he had not yet forgotten: He was perfectly charmed at it, and could not forbear to embrace her often, al|though it is not the Cu&s;tom in that Country, where their way of &s;aluting the Ladies, is to pre&s;s their Arms with their Hands. He was in &s;o good a humour, that &s;he obtained leave for the Duke <HI>de O&s;&s;one,</HI> to come back to Court, and ex|ecute his Place of Great Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Juncta</HI> that was erected to determine the Affair between the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and <HI>Don Juan de la Puente y Guebarra,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Council of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> decided it on the 12th of <HI>April.</HI> He was

entenced to be bani&s;hed, and turned out of his Office. The <HI>Nuncio</HI> demanded of them, that they would oblige him to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> to take off the Su&s;pen&s;ion he had incurred; but they thought they had puni&s;hed him &s;ufficiently. A|bundance of people &s;aid, That the&s;e great Names he took upon him, did not belong to him; and that his true Name was <HI>Don Juan de Montefillo,</HI> and that he was barely a Gentleman of the Pro|vince of <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> He fini&s;hed the Cour&s;e of his Studies at <HI>Salamanca,</HI> and afterwards was made Canon of <HI>Toledo.</HI> His Behaviour mightily plea|&s;ed the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> who was at that time Cardinal of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and taking a delight in his Conver&s;ation, tru&s;ted him with the Ma|nagement of all his Affairs. He acquitted him|&s;elf &s;o well in this Station, that the Archbi&s;hop took care to reccommend, and make him known to <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> whom he extreamly plea&s;ed by the Supplene&s;s of his Carriage, and the Vivacity of his <HI>Genius</HI>; And whether that Prince had any particular De&s;igns upon him, or only intended to prefer him, to acquit him&s;elf of the Promi&s;e he had made to the Cardinal, he made him Pre&s;ident of the Chancery of <HI>Vallado|lid.</HI> Sometime after the Count <HI>de Villambro&s;a,</HI> who was Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> happening to die, the Prince gave his Place to <HI>Don Juan de la Pu|ente.</HI> To &s;ay the truth, he only executed that Office by a Commi&s;&s;ion; but it was a very great Po&s;t, and could not fail to draw the Envy of &s;everal Per&s;ons upon him: And &s;o it really did; for few people were concerned at his Misfortunes: They looked upon him as one of the Creatures of <HI>Don Juan</HI>; and tho&s;e that were always look|ing out for an Object for their Hatred, when
<PB N="21" REF="21">
that Prince was gone, vented all their Spleen and Indignation upon him. The people accu&s;ed him of all their Grievances, and pretended, that he was the Cau&s;e of crying down the Money; That being in a Place which rendered him Chief of Ju&s;tice and the Civil Government, he might, if he had been &s;o minded, have found out &s;ome way or other to relieve &s;o many different Per|&s;ons, that &s;uffered according to their Condition. But the Complaints of private Men, nay, even tho&s;e of the Publick in general, could not have been able to hurt him, if there had not been a nece&s;&s;ity at that Juncture, to oblige the Pope, by rea&s;on of the Apprehen&s;ions they had of the De|&s;igns of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King upon <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Although the Office of the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> is the next in Dignity to that of the Chief Mini|&s;ter, yet all People have not an equal de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. <HI>Don Juan A&s;cen&s;io,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Avila,</HI> whom the King nominated to it, refu&s;ed it: An Order was &s;ent to him, to come immediately, but he de&s;ired the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> to excu&s;e him, and leave him in his Dioce&s;s. He had formerly been a Religious of the <HI>Mercy,</HI> and Ge|neral of his Order: However, as it is a hard matter to re&s;i&s;t the Will of one's Prince, e&s;peci|ally when it happens to be &s;o advantageous as this was, he obey'd the &s;econd Order that was &s;ent him, and came without any delay. He was a Per&s;on of great Di&s;cretion; and 'tis certain a Man cannot have too much to qualifie him for the Exerci&s;e of &s;o con&s;iderable a Place: for the Council of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> regulates all the Affairs that re&s;pect the Government of the States of <HI>Ca&s;tile:</HI> it was fir&s;t created in the Year 1245. by St. <HI>Fer|dmand,</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>; it is compo&s;ed of a Pre|&s;ident

<P>The Court was exceedingly troubled at the Advices they received, That the Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> having with no &s;mall pains, heaped to|gether the Sum of two hundred thou&s;and Crowns, part of which he had borrowed to &s;end to <HI>Piom|bino, Portolongone, Orbitelle</HI> and &s;ome other places which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>; the Money being embarked in a <HI>Folouque,</HI> Eight Slaves found the opportunity to carry off the Ve&s;&s;el: Two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els and a Galley were &s;ent after them to bring them back, but they were gone too far to be recovered: So all the pains of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los-Veles,</HI> tended only to &s;et Eight Slaves at liberty, and enrich them for the remainder of their Lives.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;eeing that he of <HI>France</HI> received Satisfaction upon the occa&s;ion of the Franchi&s;es and Immunities, redoubled his In&s;tances to have Ju&s;tice done him upon the <HI>Al|guazils,</HI> who had killed two of his Attendants. He received Satisfaction on the 17th of <HI>April.</HI> The <HI>Alcalde</HI> who led them on was bani&s;hed, and the <HI>Alguazils</HI> were &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and were not enlarged but by his Intreaty.</P>

<P>A certain Accident happened at Court, which I cannot forbear to relate, although it is of little Con&s;equence. The Queen had two of the pret|tie&s;t Parrots in the World, which &s;he had brought along with her from <HI>France,</HI> and loved mightily: The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> thought to do a me|ritorious work in killing them, becau&s;e they could only talk <HI>French.</HI> One day when the Queen was gone out to take a Walk, and the Dutche&s;s, to avoid going with her, and to put this De&s;ign in Execution, had pretended a &s;light Indi&s;po&s;ition; &s;he demanded the Parrots of the Woman that looked after them, and &s;o without any more a-do, as &s;oon as ever &s;he had got them into her Hands, wrung off their Necks, in &s;pight of all the Prayers and Intreaties that were u&s;ed to prevent her from killing them. This was a great Affliction to the poor <HI>French</HI> Women that waited upon the Queen, who when &s;he came back to her Apartment, commanded them to bring her Parrots and Dogs, as her cu&s;tom was always when the King was not there: for he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d not endure any of the&s;e little creatures, be|cau&s;e they came from <HI>France</HI>; and whenever he

&s;aw them, he cry'd, <HI>Fuera, fuera, Peros Frances</HI>; that is to &s;ay, <HI>Out, out, you</HI> French <HI>Dogs.</HI> All the Queen's Women, in&s;tead of going to fetch what &s;he demanded, &s;tared upon one another, and continued for &s;ome time immoveable, without daring to &s;peak a word; but at la&s;t, after a long &s;ilence, one of them gave her an account of the Execution which the <HI>Camerera</HI> had made of them She was extremly concerned, although &s;he took care not to di&s;cover it; but as &s;oon as the Dutche&s;s entred the Room, and according to her cu&s;tom, came to ki&s;s her Hand: The Queen, without &s;peaking a Syllable to her, gave her two Boxes on the Ear with her hand. Never was any thing in the World in &s;uch a Rage and Surprize as the Dutche&s;s was; for &s;he was one of the mo&s;t haughty imperious Women living, and carried as much State and Grandeur: She po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, as I mentioned before, a Kingdom in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and now to be buffeted by a young Queen, whom &s;he had hitherto treated like a Child; this appeared in&s;upportable; &s;he imme|diately flew out of the Room, &s;aying all the im|pertinent things that her Anger &s;ugge&s;ted to her, and a&s;&s;embled together her Relations and Friends, and above four hundred Ladies: With this nu|merous Train of Coaches, &s;he came to the King's Apartment, to demand Ju&s;tice of him for the Affront &s;he pretended &s;he had received from the Queen: She made &s;o great a Clamour, and &s;hed &s;o many Tears, that he &s;ent for the Queen to come to him: And as he repre&s;ented to her the high Rank which the <HI>Camarera Mayor</HI> held in the World, the Queen interrupted him, and told him, without any he&s;itation, <HI>Senor, e&s;to es une antojo.</HI></P>

The&s;e few unexpected Words clearly chan|ged the Face of Affairs: The King embraced her with a thou&s;and Te&s;timonies of Joy; ad|ding, That &s;he had done very well; and that if Two Blows were not enough to &s;atisfy her, he con&s;ented &s;he &s;hould give the Dutche&s;s Two Dozen more.

The King, who believed the Queen was with Child, was ravi&s;hed with Joy; and though he had a mighty kindne&s;s for the Dutche&s;s, yet he exceed|ingly approved of the Queen's Action: So that all the Satisfaction &s;he received from him was this, <HI>Cailla os, e&s;t as bofetadus &s;on hii as del antojo</HI>; That is to &s;ay, <HI>Hold your peace; the&s;e Blows are the Fruits of a Woman with Child.</HI> The Queen had &s;o much Prudence and Addre&s;s, as not to take the lea&s;t notice of the Death of her Parrots: So that &s;he left the King no Room to imagine, that the <HI>antojo</HI> of boxing the Old Dutche&s;s pro|ceeded from her own Re&s;entments.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Villa Menrique</HI> obtain'd the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Peru,</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Po&s;ts, by the means of a pretty Lady, of whom the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> was ex|treamly enamour'd.</P>
<P>The King, the Queen, and the Queen-Mo|ther, went together to <HI>Buen-Retiro</HI> to pa&s;s the Holy Week there. After <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> was over, the King expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to go to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> as it had always been the cu&s;tom: But the
<PB N="27" REF="27">
Queen-Mother, who had no Inclinations to be at any great di&s;tance from <HI>Madrid,</HI> becau&s;e all Affairs were managed there, and the Coun&s;el|lors never &s;tir out of it; and likewi&s;e becau&s;e the Neighbourhood of <HI>Toledo,</HI> where &s;he had been formerly confined again&s;t her Will, revived a &s;ort of Horror in her, rai&s;ed &s;o many Ob&s;tacles, that the King alter'd his Mind: So he &s;tay'd but a very incon&s;iderable time at <HI>Buen-Retiro,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed four days at the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> He would only &s;uffer him&s;elf to be accompanied by the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, one of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and the <HI>Major domo.</HI> The next day after he was arrived, the Queen wrote a very tender Letter to him, and &s;ent him a Diamond-Ring. He &s;ent her, by way of return, a Chaplet made of the Wood of <HI>Calambour,</HI> garni&s;hed with Diamonds, in a little Box of Gold Filagreen, wherein he inclo&s;ed a Billet that had only the&s;e Words, <HI>Madam, there has been a great Wind; I have killed &s;ix Wolves.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he returned to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the de&s;ire of going to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> &s;eized him again. By a cu&s;tom that had been e&s;tabli&s;hed ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Philip</HI> II. the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> were u&s;ed to go to this Noble Hou&s;e &s;ome time after <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> This is appointed in the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> of the Palace, which is a Rule they always fol|low: In it are to be found all the Ceremonies that are to be ob&s;erved, the Habits which the Kings and Queens are to wear, the Time of their going to their Royal Hou&s;es, how long they are to continue there; the Days of going to Chappel, as al&s;o tho&s;e for Bull-Fea&s;ts, and running at the Ring; the Hour of their Maje|&s;ties going to Bed, and Ri&s;ing; and a thou&s;and
<PB N="28" REF="28">
other things of the &s;ame Nature. But, as it happen'd, there was &s;o great a &s;carcity of Mo|ney, that the King was obliged to &s;tay at <HI>Ma|drid:</HI> However, to excu&s;e and colour &s;o extra|ordinary a thing, they gave out, that the Small-Pox was at <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> which being &s;cituated upon the Road to <HI>Malago,</HI> where the Plague raged, and from whence it might ea&s;ily be &s;pread thi|ther, his Maje&s;ty was not willing to hazard him|&s;elf &s;o far as to venture thither.</P>
<P>The Court was troubled at the Advices they received on the fir&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> That the Fi&s;her|men of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Andaye,</HI> had been lately engaged in a Quarrel about the Fi&s;hery of the River <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa,</HI> which &s;eparates the Two Kingdoms. They fought, and &s;everal Men were killed on both &s;ides: but what con|cerned them the mo&s;t, was, That the Gover|nour of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ending to part them, play'd the Cannon upon the <HI>French,</HI> and demoli&s;hed &s;ome Hou&s;es in <HI>Andaye:</HI> So that to prevent the Con&s;equences, which might perhaps have proved very dangerous, they commanded him to repair the Hou&s;es that were battered, and give the <HI>French</HI> Fi&s;hermen all the Satisfaction they de&s;ired. Our Amba&s;&s;ador a&s;&s;ured them, that he would write to his Ma&s;ter, and acquaint him with what readine&s;s and complai&s;ance this Af|fair was made up at Court.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> offer'd to make the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villa Franca</HI> Coun&s;ellor of State, pro|vided he would quit his Place of Lieutenant-General of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> which the King had a mind to be&s;tow upon Prince <HI>Alexander Farne&s;e:</HI> but he returned him this An&s;wer, <HI>That having Rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf, that he had di&s;charged</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="29">
<HI>this Office well, he could never be prevailed with to throw it up to another, as long as he was capable of doing the Duties of it him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Confe&s;&s;or was upon the point of being &s;ent away about the beginning of <HI>May.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> de&s;igned that place for Father <HI>Bayona,</HI> Confe&s;&s;or of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Alcala</HI>; for he imagined he might reckon upon him, and be&s;ide, the King had given his con&s;ent. They had a mind to be&s;tow the Bi|&s;hoprick of <HI>Plazencia</HI> upon Father <HI>Francis de Re|lux,</HI> to have a favourable pretence to remove him: But he u&s;ed all the Intere&s;t and Credit he had in the World to keep his old Po&s;t, decla|ring; That he would refu&s;e the Bi&s;hoprick; and that if the King turned him off, he would every-where complain of the Chief Mini&s;ter. Although the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> hated him heartily, becau&s;e he was difficult of Acce&s;s, and having a great A&s;cendant over the King, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd him with &s;everal Scruples, in order to pur&s;ue his own particular Views; yet he was forced to let him alone. Every one is of Opi|nion, that the Duke had done much more di&s;|creetly, not to have di&s;covered his Intentions again&s;t him, unle&s;s he had been in a capacity to put them in Execution, becau&s;e to &s;hew an ill Will, and not be able to effect our De&s;igns, only draws more Enemies upon our heads, and expo&s;es us to the contempt of all the World, which will be apt to conclude we only are too weak. But this was not all; he left in the Per|&s;on of the Confe&s;&s;or a Man that was always with the King, and who was &s;ure to oppo&s;e him in every thing; but that was not the only thing he had Rea&s;on to apprehend. The <HI>Cama|rera</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<HI>Mayor,</HI> and <HI>Don Jeronimo de Eguya,</HI> &s;till con|tinued to po&s;&s;e&s;s the King's Favours; They had opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e him as often as they plea&s;ed, by vertue of their Places, and neglected no occa&s;ions to advance and &s;ecure their own Intere&s;t. This was a &s;ort of a <HI>Triumvirate,</HI> which might very well check the Authority of the Chief Mini&s;ter; he very well &s;aw what he was to fear from this quarter, and was extreamly concerned at it; he had long ago de&s;ired to re|move <HI>de Eguya,</HI> but he fixed him&s;elf every day more and more in the King's good Graces; and the Death of <HI>Don Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</HI> left him in the intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Place, which before he had only exerci&s;ed by a Commi&s;&s;ion. He likewi&s;e obtained a Place of being a Coun|&s;ellor in the Chamber of the <HI>Indies</HI>; and when the Duke u&s;ed all his Endeavours to remove him from bu&s;ine&s;s, he perceived that the King's in|clination prevailed above all his Attempts to the contrary; for his Maje&s;ty was per&s;uaded, that <HI>de Eguya</HI> was faithful and nece&s;&s;ary to him. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">vo,</HI> as well as the Confe&s;&s;or, confirmed him in this Opinion: So that they rendred one another all good Offices recipro|cally; and this was a &s;ure and ea&s;y way to &s;up|port them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the Night that the <HI>Camarera Mayor</HI> had received that Cha&s;ti&s;ement from the Queen, after a long con&s;ideration of the matter, &s;he found, that if &s;he continu'd to ob&s;erve the &s;ame rigorous Conduct towards that young Prince&s;s, which &s;he had hitherto u&s;ed, &s;he could never in|&s;inuate her &s;elf into her Affections. Be&s;ides this, &s;he knew that the Queen-Mother utterly di&s;ap|proved this &s;ort of Treatment, and that &s;he had
<PB N="30" REF="31">
frequently &s;poke to the King her Son about it; that &s;he had repre&s;ented to him, that there was &s;o va&s;t a difference between the Cu&s;toms of <HI>France</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Spain,</HI> that there was a ne|ce&s;&s;ity to make &s;ome Allowances, and not to perplex a Young Prince&s;s, who&s;e Age, as well as the Sweetne&s;s of her Temper, de&s;erved ano|ther &s;ort of U&s;age. The <HI>Camarera</HI> look'd upon her &s;elf as undone, if &s;he did not lay a&s;ide all her former Severity; and the&s;e con&s;iderations pre|vailed with her to a&s;&s;ume a more engaging Air, and to endeavour to relieve the Queen in all her pen&s;ive moments, by di&s;covering the King's Humour to her, and the means to plea&s;e him. Whenever the King was vex'd, and out of Hu|mour, &s;he &s;eem'd to &s;pare no pains to &s;weeren him; and the Queen being of a frank, ea&s;y Di&s;po&s;ition, was immediately per&s;waded, that the Dutche&s;s had taken up a better Temper, and even believed, that &s;he did her all the Ser|vices &s;he could. But the re&s;t of the World were of a different Opinion from her Maje&s;ty; they knew well enough that this Old <HI>Belldame</HI> was rather inclined in her own Nature, to throw Oil into the fire, than endeavour to quench it; and they alledged, as an indi&s;putable Proof of this, all the ill impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had made upon the King, in relation to the <HI>French</HI>; nay, even the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable things that came from <HI>France:</HI> For, as I &s;ignified before, the Queen dur&s;t not play with the little Dogs &s;he had brought along with her, before the King; and the two Parrots were killed for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they talked <HI>French:</HI> The King was out of humour as oft as any <HI>Frenchman</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through the Court of the Palace, e&s;pecially if the Queen looked upon
<PB N="32" REF="32">
him, although it was through the Windows and Lattices of her Chamber.</P>
<P>As &s;he was going one day to our Ladies Church, <HI>Datocha,</HI> a poor fellow, who was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> came to her Coach, and begged an Alms of her; the King was in &s;o horrible a Pa&s;&s;ion, that they were afraid he would have cau&s;ed this Unfortu|nate Wretch to be killed immediately. The <HI>Camerera</HI> officiou&s;ly coun&s;ell'd the Queen to order him to leave <HI>Madrid</HI> without any delay; but if the Dutche&s;s had not prejudiced the King after this manner, it is not to be imagined that the Queen had been expo&s;ed to the&s;e Injuries which happened &s;o often to her.</P>
<P>This is &s;o undeniable a truth, that one day when their Maje&s;ties went into the City, two Gentle|men belonging to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Holland,</HI> chancing to meet them, they &s;topt their Coach, out of Re&s;pect, and &s;aluted them as they ought: They were on that &s;ide the Queen happened to be of, and were apparelled after the <HI>French</HI> Fa|&s;hion. This immediately rai&s;ed the <HI>Camarera</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion, who commanded one of the Guards to go and demand of them who they were, from whence they came, whither they were going, what bu&s;ine&s;s they had in <HI>Madrid?</HI> And when to this they an&s;wered, That they were both <HI>Hol|landers</HI> in the Amba&s;&s;ador's Retinue, &s;he believed it to be a Sham, or at lea&s;t pretended to believe it, that &s;he might give the King a fre&s;h occa&s;ion to commend her Care and Zeal for him: So that &s;he &s;ent to the Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf to be better &s;atisfied; and when &s;he was fully a&s;&s;ured of the truth, &s;he &s;ent the two Gentlemen word, That when they met their Maje&s;ties, they &s;hould never be guilty of the Pre&s;umption any more to
<PB N="33" REF="33">
go on the Queen's &s;ide, to &s;alute her, or look upon her. Neverthele&s;s, ob&s;erving the Queen to be concerned at this Conduct, as &s;oon as &s;he was informed of it, &s;he thought to efface all this out of her Mind, by &s;ending often to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and giving him to under&s;tand that &s;he was angry with him for coming &s;o &s;eldom to the Palace. She u&s;ed the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, and told her, That it would be the greate&s;t Joy in the World to her to &s;ee them vi&s;it the Young Queen oftner, who perhaps was too melancholy in private, and would certainly find no &s;mall Diver&s;ion to en|joy the Company of Per&s;ons of their Merit, and who were of the &s;ame Country with her. This did not make the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> alter his Conduct in the lea&s;t; for he under&s;tood well enough what was the meaning of the&s;e fair Speeches; but as for his Lady, there &s;eldom pa&s;|&s;ed a day but &s;he went to wait upon the Queen, either in the Queen-Mother's company, or all alone by her &s;elf; but notwith&s;tanding the A&s;|&s;iduity of her Vi&s;its, &s;he &s;eldom found an oppor|tunity to entertain her in private: She was hin|dered from doing this by the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies, who came to make their Court; or el&s;e by the King's coming, who went every other moment from his own Apartment to the Queen's; for 'tis the Cu&s;tom there, that as &s;oon as he appears, all the Women that are in the Chamber do immediately withdraw.</P>
<P>Without reckoning the Penance of this ex|traordinary Solitude, the Queen had other things to afflict her, and one was to find her &s;elf clearly de&s;titute of Money; and this, con&s;idering the Genero&s;ity of her Heart, and her natural Incli|nation
<PB N="34" REF="34">
to be liberal, was a very &s;en&s;ible Mortifi|cation. She had lived there &s;ix Months intire, without having any Money to &s;erve her for her le&s;&s;er plea&s;ures; and &s;he was forced to borrow a little, to buy a few things &s;he had nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion for, and to keep a few Hor&s;es &s;he had brought with her out of <HI>France,</HI> that were be|come altogether un&s;erviceable to her, becau&s;e &s;he had no permi&s;&s;ion to ride them out at any time. She wanted Money likewi&s;e to &s;end back &s;ome of her Women that could not comply with the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Spain,</HI> and whom they could not con&s;equently endure there. The few Officers that &s;he was allowed to bring with her, were all di&s;mi&s;t, even to her Chyrurgeon, who had bought the Place, and performed the Journey at his own Expences. All of them departed; and this con&s;ideration redoubled the young Queen's Afflictions, to &s;ee &s;he was not Mi&s;tri&s;s enough to keep them any longer, or to do them tho&s;e kindne&s;&s;es &s;he de&s;igned. On the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 500 Pi&s;tols a Month were a&s;&s;igned her; but this was in a manner le&s;s than nothing, becau&s;e for &s;ix Months together &s;he had been forced to bor|row Money, and even out of this &s;mall Sum &s;he was obliged to lay a&s;ide 200 Pi&s;tols monthly for &s;ome Alms and Charity, which the Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> were accu&s;tomed to make. All this while no Orders were given out about the Cur|rant Money of the Kingdom, nor was the Price of Victuals regulated; a great Want and Scar|city reigned every where, and the Publick Mi|&s;eries daily increa&s;ed: it had not rained for &s;ix Months together, and this very much contribu|ted to inhance the Price of Corn: So that the People were reduced to the la&s;t Extremities:
<PB N="35" REF="35">
Nay, what is infinitely more &s;urpri&s;ing, they were not in a condition to pay the Queen the Money that was a&s;&s;igned to her, Gold and Sil|ver being &s;o &s;carce, that none of it was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Aquila</HI> being arrived at <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Place of Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>; and the fir&s;t of his Cares was to relieve and ea&s;e the People of their Grievances. To effect this, he made a &s;trict Examination into the mo&s;t minute matters, and &s;oon di&s;co|vered, that the gro&s;s Monopolies, and in&s;atia|ble Avarice of the Magi&s;trates, were partly the occa&s;ion of the&s;e horrid Di&s;orders. He came to be informed, That even the Coun&s;ellors of the Council Royal, by &s;ome of their Creatures, took their &s;hares of the Impo&s;ts that were laid upon Victuals; and that the &s;ome thing was done in the Oil, Chocolat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and other Provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for Life: That the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">dors</HI> and <HI>Corregidors</HI> belonging to the Town-Hall, play'd mo&s;t abominable Cheats in the Corn, and con&s;equently advanced the Price of Bread at lea&s;t one half above its u&s;ual Price. But he was &s;en&s;ible that he was not able to rectifie the&s;e Abu&s;es alone; &s;o he di&s;cour&s;ed the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> about the matter, who&s;e Encourage|ment and A&s;&s;i&s;tance he promi&s;ed him&s;elf. Ne|verthele&s;s, whether the Duke were otherwi&s;e employed, or had no real intentions to change the Form of the Government, he did not an|&s;wer the Pre&s;ident's De&s;ires, who perceiving that if he acted by him&s;elf, the hatred of all tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom he &s;hould cau&s;e to be puni&s;hed, would directly fall upon his own Head, he was not willing to Sacrifice him&s;elf for the Publick

Good. He remembred that in the time of the Regency, a certain Bi&s;hop, who was Pre&s;i|dent as he was, having endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e Abu&s;es, had been poi&s;oned by the Magi|&s;trates.</P>
<P>In the mean time every thing without excep|tion continued to be as dear as formerly, and Silver was &s;o &s;carce a Commodity, that one would have imagined it had been all melted down; I once &s;aw at a Relation's Hou&s;e of mine the Sum of almo&s;t three thou&s;and Crowns received in Pieces of <HI>Bellon</HI> and in <HI>Ochavos</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The&s;e are much of the &s;ame value with the <HI>French</HI> Doubles, and are &s;carce an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Farthing</NOTE>, which are a wretched &s;ort of Bra&s;s Money, and for the greate&s;t part bad, and yet happy was the Man who in this Univer&s;al Scarcity could get this Money. However, I am obliged to &s;ay this in honour of <HI>Spain,</HI> that although the Finances were in that &s;ad condition as I repre|&s;ented them before, yet the King paid all the Pen&s;ions that were due to Foreigners very exact|ly, becau&s;e he looked upon him&s;elf obliged in Honour to do it, and yet to confe&s;s a truth, &s;ome of the&s;e Pen&s;ions were not incon&s;iderable.

<P>The Families that were ready to die of Hun|ger, &s;et them&s;elves to Rob and Murder, being in a manner Authorized in the&s;e Di&s;orders by the little care that was taken to puni&s;h Murder|ers as they de&s;erved, and by the extraordinary Partiality which the Judges &s;hew to the Natives of the Country.

in one of the lea&s;t frequented Quarters of the Town, and re&s;olved by main force to break open &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates Hou&s;es, becau&s;e they principally charged them with the Di&s;orders of the pre&s;ent Affairs, and afterwards to Plunder them in the face of the World, to &s;erve for an Example to others. But as this De&s;ign was only formed by a Mutinous Rabble, who had never a Head to lead them on, &s;o it is not to be won|dred if they did not pu&s;h their wicked Intentions any farther.

<P>The Shoemakers being informed about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> that the Price of Shoes was ordered to be regulated, pre&s;ented a Pe|tition to the new Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> wherein with terms full of Re&s;pect they repre&s;ented their Rea&s;ons again&s;t this Regulation, making it ap|pear that they could not po&s;&s;ibly le&s;&s;en the Price of Shoes, as long as Leather was &s;old &s;o dear as it was.

They mut|tered a few words, and being at that time none of the &s;tronge&s;t, went in a Body to find out their

Companions and Friends, and then immedi|ately repaired to the Court of the Palace. They ran under the Windows of the King's Chamber, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> it is the Cu&s;tom there when the People complain of the Government, they cried out as loud as they were able, <HI>Let the King live, and let the ill Government die.</HI> As &s;oon as the King per|ceived it, he came near the Window, and was extreamly &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;o great a Rabble got together, for by this time abundance of other People had joined them. The King &s;ent in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eat ha&s;te to find out the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who came among&s;t them, and promi&s;ed them all the &s;atisfaction imaginable: He moreover told them, they violated that Re&s;pect they owed His Maje&s;ty, in coming to demand Ju&s;tice of him with &s;uch Clamours and Tumults, and that if they would follow him home, he would pre|&s;ently content them. They very readily went along with him, &s;o he gave them a permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ell their Shoes at the &s;ame Price as they did be|fore the Order was publi&s;hed. This made them return the joyfulle&s;t People in the World; but they happened to meet the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Al|caldes</HI> in the way, who not knowing a Syllable of what had pa&s;t, and not at all con&s;idering that he had to do with an unruly Mob, &s;topt them to vent his Reproaches and Menaces again&s;t them. But this procedure rai&s;ed their Indigna|tion &s;o high, that they drew out their Swords with a de&s;ign to kill him, and pur&s;ued him &s;o fiercely, that never was any Man under more terrible Apprehen&s;ions.

<P>The Queen Mother, who was every day at <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> and &s;earched all means to gain the Affections of the People, gave three Comedies, with Mu&s;ick between the Acts, that were re|pre&s;ented on a Theatre in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> that abundance of People might have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them without putting them to any Expence.

There was a nece&s;&s;ity to be &s;evere, to di&s;gu&s;t &s;ome, and puni&s;h others; to remove &s;everal things that had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed; to give ones &s;elf up entirely to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;tant Application, before the&s;e matters could ever be accompli&s;hed: But this was not the Genius of the Duke, and his Natural Sweetne&s;s and Bounty &s;uited but very ill with that &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;o|lution that ought to be ob&s;erved in the&s;e nice rancounters.

In the mean time &s;everal People of great Me|rit and Birth were di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;he the Duke confided in him no longer, they were in hopes that they would have joyned together to Regu|late the Money. The good was dimini&s;hed, as I &s;aid before, and the bad continued to go as freely as formerly it did. It was therefore re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s it for good and all in Commerce, and an Edict was publi&s;hed on the 24<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 1680. by which the King &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the Copper Money that had gone for &s;everal Years, and People were ordered to bring it in within Ten Days to certain Offices that were &s;et up in all parts of <HI>Madrid,</HI> where they were to receive Bills of Exchange for it, that were payable in Six Months. But they found a va&s;t inconvenience in the Execution of this Project; for in the two <HI>Ca&s;tiles</HI> they had &s;ixteen Millions of this Money, part of which were mixed with good Silver, and the other was notoriou&s;ly bad. So that to draw the&s;e &s;ixteen Millions out of the hands of private Per&s;ons, they found in the King's Coffers a Fund of only &s;ix&s;core thou&s;and Crowns: how|ever, this did not hinder the crying down of the Money; and as for tho&s;e Per&s;ons that had &s;tore of it, they were utterly undone. It is an ea&s;ie matter to imagine what &s;ad Effects the&s;e new Grievances drew upon the People, who were mi&s;erable enough in all con&s;cience before, and who were forced to buy every thing at exce&s;&s;ive Rates.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of the Inqui&s;ition, with their Trumpets, Kettle-Drums and Banners marching before them, went on the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> in a Ca|valcade, from the Palace to the <HI>Placa Major,</HI>

<P><HI>Don Thomas de la Cerda,</HI> Brother to the Duke <HI>de Medina-Celi,</HI> parted for <HI>Cales,</HI> with &s;o mag|nificent an Equipage, that a Prince of the Blood could not have a finer. Three Men of War waited to carry him over to <HI>New Spain,</HI> of which he was made Vice-Roy.</P>

<P>On the 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> a Bull-Fea&s;t was kept, at which the King and the Queen, attended by all the Court, made their Appearance. This &s;eemed an extraordinary fine Show to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> becau&s;e two of the Combatants were killed upon the Spot, and three Cavaliers more were dangerou&s;ly wounded. The Queen was &s;o concerned at it, that &s;he found her &s;elf &s;ome|what di&s;compo&s;ed; however, &s;he took care not to di&s;cover it, for fear of di&s;quieting the King.</P>

<P>On the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> there was kept at <HI>Ma|drid</HI> an <HI>Auto de Inqui&s;ition</HI>; That is to &s;ay, a ge|neral Execution of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The People ran thither in their be&s;t Cloaths, and with as great an earne&s;tne&s;s as if it had been to the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;how. A great Scaffold was erected in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> where from Seven a Clock in the Morning till Nine at Night, nothing was to be &s;een but Criminals of both Sexes, that had been &s;ent from all the <HI>Inqui&s;itions</HI> to <HI>Madrid:</HI> Their Proce&s;s was read aloud, and Judgment
<PB N="45" REF="45">
was pronounced again&s;t them: Twenty <HI>Jews</HI> as well Men was Women, and a <HI>Renegado Maho|metan,</HI> were &s;entenced to be burnt: Five more <HI>Jews</HI> of both Sexes, this being the fir&s;t time they were apprehended, and now repenting of their Errors, were condemned to a long Impri|&s;onment, and to wear a Yellow Scapulary, with a Red St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Cro&s;s upon it, which they call a <HI>Sanbenito,</HI> as tho&s;e that carry this Habit are called <HI>Sanbenitados.</HI> Ten more accu&s;ed of <HI>Bigamy, Witchcraft</HI> and <HI>Sorcery,</HI> were &s;entenced to be whipt, and &s;ent to the Gallies: The&s;e wore Pa&s;tboard Bonnets upon their Heads, with In|&s;criptions upon them, having a Rope about their Necks, and Torches in their Hands. All the Court was pre&s;ent, the King, the two Queens, the Ladies, the Amba&s;&s;adors, the Grandees, and a great multitude of People. The Inqui|&s;itor's Chair was placed after the manner of a Tribunal, and was much above that of the King, and a great deal higher. The&s;e Unfortunate People were per&s;ecuted &s;o near the King, that he heard all their Complaints and Groans; for the Scaffold where they were ranged touched his Balcony. The Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> did the &s;ame thing here as our Provo&s;t-Mar&s;hal's Men do in <HI>France,</HI> they conducted the Criminals that were to be burnt, and held them tied fa&s;t with thick Cords: The <HI>Famillares</HI>; that is to &s;ay, the Dome&s;tick Officers of the <HI>Holy Inqui&s;ition,</HI> at the &s;ame time led the other Offenders, and &s;everal of the Religious, whether Learned or Ignorant, di&s;puted vehemently with them, to convince the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures of the Truth of our Religion.

very &s;urprizing An&s;wers to their Di&s;putants. Among&s;t the re&s;t, there was a young Woman, of admirable Beauty, who &s;eemed not to be above Seventeen Years of Age, and happening to be on the &s;ame &s;ide where the Queen was, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf to her, to obtain Favour at her Hands: <HI>Great Queen,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>cannot your Royal Pre&s;ence bring &s;ome Remedy to my Misfor|tunes? Have pity on my Youth, and con&s;ider that I am per&s;ecuted for a Religion which I have &s;ucked in with my Mother's Milk.</HI> The Queen turned away her Eyes, and appear'd to pity her ca&s;e, but dur&s;t not make any interce&s;&s;ion to have her &s;aved.</P>
<P>Ma&s;s was now began, in the mid&s;t of which the Prie&s;t that officiated, quitted the Altar, and &s;ate down upon a Seat which was prepared for him; then the Inqui&s;itor-General de&s;cended from the Amphitheater, dre&s;t in his Cope, and having a Mitre on his Head; and after he had bowed towards the Altar, he advanced to the King's Balcony, which he a&s;cended by &s;ome Steps that went round the Scaffold, accompa|nied by &s;ome Officers of the Inqui&s;ition, who carried the Cro&s;s, and the Evangeli&s;ts, and a Book containing the Oath by which the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> oblige them&s;elves to protect the Catho|lick Faith, to extirpate Here&s;ies, and to &s;upport the Procedures of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> with their Royal Authority.</P>
<P>The King &s;tood up, with his Head uncovered, and having the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> on one &s;ide of him, who held the Royal Sword lifted up, &s;wore to ob&s;erve the Oath, which a Coun&s;ellor of the Council Royal read to him, and continued in this po&s;ture till &s;uch time as the Inqui&s;itor was return|ed to his Place. Then a Secretary of the Inqui&s;i|tion
<PB N="47" REF="47">
got up in a Pulpit, and read the &s;ame Oath, which he cau&s;ed the Councils, and all the A&s;&s;em|bly to take. It was about Noon when Ma&s;s be|gan, and it was not over till Nine a clock at Night, by rea&s;on of the long Sentences of the condemned Per&s;ons, that were read aloud one after another. The Con&s;tancy and Re&s;olution with which they went to the place of Puni&s;hment, had &s;omething in it which was very extraordinary; &s;everal of them ca&s;t them&s;elves into the fire, others burnt their Hands, and afterwards their Feet in the Flames, bearing their Torments with a Tranqui|lity which made them be lamented, that &s;uch re&s;olute Souls were not illuminated with the Light of Faith. As for my&s;elf, I did not go to behold this &s;ad Spectacle; for be&s;ides that it was midnight, and the place of Execution was with|out the Gate of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> I was &s;o concerned at what I had &s;een in the day-time, that I found my &s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed. The King could not avoid &s;eeing this horrible &s;ight, both becau&s;e it was a Religious Affair, and becau&s;e he is obliged to authorize by his Pre&s;ence whatever the Inqui&s;i|tion does. We mu&s;t not believe that the&s;e rigo|rous Examples do in the lea&s;t promote the Con|ver&s;ion of the <HI>Jews</HI>; they are not at all concern|ed at it, and there are a con&s;iderable number of them in <HI>Madrid,</HI> who are known to be &s;uch, and yet are quietly &s;uffered to enjoy their Em|ployments in the <HI>Finances.</HI> Among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Don Aventura Dionis</HI> was reckoned: His Father gave Seventy thou&s;and Crowns to be made a Knight of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and he him&s;elf a few days after this Execution, obtained of the King a Marque&s;s's Title, which &s;tood him in Fifty thou&s;and Crowns.

<P>The Duke <HI>de Giovenazzo,</HI> who from being Envoy at the Court of <HI>Savoy,</HI> was nominated to go Amba&s;&s;ador to that of <HI>France,</HI> was ordered to return to <HI>Turin.</HI> But the Count <HI>de Gubernatis,</HI> who at that time was under no Character at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and who was making Preparations for his Journey to <HI>Portugal,</HI> went to find out the Chief Mini&s;ter, and repre&s;ented to him, <HI>That the Duke his Ma&s;ter was &s;o ill &s;atisfied, to &s;ee that his Mini&s;ters were not treated in</HI> Spain <HI>with the &s;ame Re&s;pect as they were in</HI> France<HI>, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e they did not pay him the&s;e great Sums that were due to him, that he de&s;ired to &s;ee an Envoy of</HI> Spain <HI>no more at</HI> Turin. The Duke <HI>de Medina-Celi</HI> an&s;wer|ed him, <HI>That whatever Treatment was paid his Ma&s;ter in</HI> France<HI>, ought not to be u&s;ed as a Con&s;e|quence for the King of</HI> Spain <HI>to do the like, who was &s;o far above all other Kings, that he had no Example to follow.</HI> The Count replied, <HI>That he had no mind at pre&s;ent to enter into an Examination of their Greatne&s;s, or the difference that might be between them; but that he had not forgotten, that about Twenty Years ago</HI> Philip IV. <HI>had declared by the Marque&s;s</HI> de la Fuente<HI>, That his Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould not appear at the Ceremonies where tho&s;e of</HI> France

<HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and that this Declaration was very well known, and accordingly regulated in all the Courts of</HI> Europe. The Duke an&s;wered him, That he knew nothing of the matter, and that he could hardly believe the bu&s;ine&s;s was as he repre&s;ented it. In the mean time, they made &s;everal Re|flections at Court upon the Propo&s;als of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>; and <HI>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</HI> who had been nominated to go to <HI>Turin,</HI> was recalled home before he arrived there. Neverthele&s;s, they di&s;penced with them&s;elves &s;o far, as to &s;end to compliment the Duke, upon the Alliance he was going to make with the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince&s;s, as it was commonly pretended, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be poy&s;oned; and what made the World judge &s;o, was, becau&s;e one of her Officers having carried &s;ome of the Di&s;hes from her Table to his own Hou&s;e, his Wife, and &s;ome others, after they had eat of them, found them|&s;elves extreamly ill, that they believed they &s;hould die, and had all of them Marks of poy&s;on about them. This Accident occa&s;ioned a great bu&s;tle at <HI>Lisbon</HI>; the People mutinied, and want|ing an Object for their Fury to work upon, they de&s;ign'd to pick a quarrel with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Envoy, although they had no Rea&s;on for it, and he was ju&s;t upon the point of &s;uffering the great|e&s;t Outrages imaginable.

<P>On the 22d of the &s;ame Month, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor, made his Entry. All his Retinue were barely cloathed in Gray, and his Coaches had no Gilding about them.

To this we may add, that the People there love fine Shows above any thing in the World; and it being known, that the Amba&s;&s;ador had received twenty five thou&s;and Crowns to defray the Char|ges of his Journey, and that he drew every Year from the Emperour and the King forty thou|&s;and Crowns more, they were ready to throw Stones at him, when they &s;aw him make &s;o &s;can|dalous an Entry. <HI>Don Diego de Bracamonte,</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Malta,</HI> was the Rea&s;on why he made his Entry no &s;ooner.

Being under the&s;e Expectations, he demanded that his Cha|riot might march immediately after that of the la&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador of the Chappel; the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana</HI> would by no means con&s;ent to it, al|ledging what had been formerly done by the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o that example was followed.

<P>He tarried till the Court was gone to the <HI>E&s;|curial,</HI> and took his Opportunity to go to his Hou&s;e on a certain day, when he knew he was not at home: but this did not &s;atisfie the Mar|que&s;s, who &s;aid, he reckoned that Vi&s;it for no|thing, which he had not received; <HI>D'Eguya</HI> an&s;wered, That he had acquitted him&s;elf of his Duty; and thus they did not &s;ee one another at all.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Medina-Celi</HI> not being ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured to continue Chief Mini&s;ter long, thought it the be&s;t way to make all Advantages of the pre&s;ent Opportunity. He had nine Daughters, but had only married two of them, and had a great mind to be&s;tow the third upon the Son of the Con&s;table <HI>Colonna,</HI> who was newly returned to <HI>Madrid</HI> from his Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and had brought his Children along with him. This appeared to be a very Advantageous Match for the Duke's Daughter, and therefore having it &s;till in his Eye, he &s;hewed a particular Re|&s;pect to the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez,</HI> who was Brother-in-law to the Con&s;table. Few Per&s;ons penetrated at fir&s;t into the true Motive of the thing; they thought he did it only to have a fit Occa&s;ion to take his In&s;tructions, becau&s;e he was capable of giving him the be&s;t: but the more under&s;tanding People &s;oon di&s;covered that the great de&s;ire he had to conclude this Alliance, was the principal Rea&s;on; for at the bottom the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> had more Reputation at the time when his Emba&s;&s;ies and great Negoti|ations kept him at a di&s;tance, than when he was at <HI>Madrid.</HI> Whether it proceeded from the Envy the World bore him, or that his Pre&s;ence made them examine his Faults more narrowly&punc; it is certain that People had a better Opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

him when he was ab&s;ent, than when they &s;aw him before them. The good Graces of the Duke &s;till contributed to draw more Hatred and Envy upon him, but they did not la&s;t long enough to made him &s;uffer any thing upon that Account.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t things they u&s;ually re|proached <HI>Balbazez</HI> with, was his exce&s;&s;ive, Ava|rice, which bu&s;ied it &s;elf in the mo&s;t incon&s;ide|rable matters, altho he was Ma&s;ter of a plenti|ful Fortune, and might have lived after another manner, without incommoding his E&s;tate in the lea&s;t. He was a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Spinola</HI>; his Grandfather had formerly commanded the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, and this was likewi&s;e a great Captain; but whether it were becau&s;e he was a Stranger, or for &s;ome other Rea&s;on, the Gran|dees of <HI>Spain</HI> looked upon him as much inferior to them, although he was a Grandee as well as them&s;elves, and was of illu&s;trious Birth. They de&s;pi&s;ed him, becau&s;e he made Advantage of his Money, after the manner of a Banker, which is &s;o &s;eldom practi&s;ed in <HI>Spain</HI> by Per&s;ons of Quality, that they cannot endure tho&s;e that do it. His Enemies pretended, that he had committed notorious Over&s;ights at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and that they daily beheld new Inconveniences ari&s;e from his ill Conduct there; That this was the Subject of perpetual quarrels between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e he had neglected to lay down in plain intelligible terms, what things were yielded up, and their Dependencies, and that every one made u&s;e of this Ob&s;curity to interpret it to their own Advantage.</P>
<P>It is certain that what they alledged again&s;t the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez,</HI> had foundation

enough, but the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was the Man that took the greate&s;t pains to expo&s;e his Mi&s;carriages to the World. He had no kindne&s;s for him for <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s &s;ake, who&s;e Favourite he had always been, and for which rea&s;on the Marque&s;s declared again&s;t the Queen. This was the true Cau&s;e of the Aver&s;ion that was between the Con&s;table and him, and it increa&s;ed very much on the &s;ide of the former, when he &s;aw what a Re&s;pect and E&s;teem the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> te&s;tified for the other. He needed no more than this to revive the Old Grudge he had again&s;t the Chief Mini&s;ter, and it proceeded &s;o far, that he ince&s;&s;antly heighten'd the Complaints that came from all parts, under the Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> again&s;t the Duke. It mu&s;t be al|lowed, that the Con&s;table was one of the mo&s;t dexterous prudent Men of his Age, and that his Rank and great Abilities gave him va&s;t Advan|tages over the re&s;t; &s;o that whenever he gave his Advice, few People were found &s;o hardy as to oppo&s;e him. The Duke was &s;en&s;ible, that he directly thwarted him upon all occa&s;ions: This, together with his other Affairs, made him ex|treamly unea&s;ie, to find him&s;elf perpetually en|gaged in a trouble&s;ome Combat, and to di&s;pute again&s;t a Man, who, as we may &s;ay, took a Plea&s;ure in chafing him&s;elf, and who &s;earched all occa&s;i|ons to perplex and di&s;gu&s;t him. Therefore in this Affair the Duke took the milde&s;t cour&s;e; he courted the Con&s;table's Friend&s;hip, and made all Advances towards it: He knew that he was fall'n ill, and that though he was not in a con|dition to go to the Council, he was not &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, but that he might have his Advice, in ca&s;e it were demanded.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="55">
He &s;ent con&s;tantly to the Con&s;table's Hou&s;e to con&s;ult him upon all important occa&s;ions, and this mark of di&s;tinction flatter'd his Vanity &s;o agreeably, that he found him&s;elf mightily obliged to the Duke. He wanted very little of pretend|ing to be always &s;ick for the time to come, as long as the Duke continued to give him &s;o evi|dent a proof of Deference: However, 'tis very certain, that although he was as well as ever, he would not &s;tir abroad for a long time, only to prolong a thing which filled him with &s;o much Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction. He received another Obligation from the Duke, which made no le&s;s an impre&s;&s;ion upon him; a con&s;iderable Benefice happening to be vacant, he be&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ed it immedi|ately upon one of his Natural S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> without the Con&s;table's ever demanding it. So many unex|pected Favours perfectly overcame him, and made him de&s;irous to do &s;omething on his &s;ide; &s;o he propo&s;ed to &s;ubmit to a Reference, in order to accommodate the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Duke <HI>de Cardonne</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ion. The Con&s;table had e&s;pou&s;ed his Widow, and the Duke his Daughter: The&s;e two Ladies had great Preten&s;ions, and as great Differences; therefore they thought it the be&s;t way to determine them by the mutual con|&s;ent of both Parties: The Duke was &s;en&s;ible, that the Con&s;table, who naturally loved long tedious Law-Suits, &s;hew'd a great deal of Complai&s;ance in this matter; and indeed the Con&s;table was of Opinion, that it would be better to put an end to this Affair, than be ingaged in an everla&s;ting Conte&s;t with the Chief Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>This Chief Mini&s;ter often a&s;&s;i&s;ted the King, and denied Audience to no body; but neither did his Endeavours or Audiences produce any

advantageous Effects for the publick Intere&s;t, and the &s;malle&s;t Affairs were as difficult for him to determine, as the greate&s;t. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana</HI> knew &s;o well beforehand what he was to expect upon this &s;core, that he could not be brought to accept the Emba&s;&s;y for <HI>Spain,</HI> till he received expre&s;s Orders from the Emperour, al|though for his farther Encouragement he had &s;everal Relations and Friends at <HI>Madrid</HI>; and that be&s;ides his having re&s;ided there formerly, the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Favours he might rea&s;onably expect for his Ma&s;ter's &s;ake, ought to have overcome the unwillingne&s;s he expre&s;&s;ed to come to this Court. It is true, what &s;erved to increa&s;e it very much, was the &s;ecret Advantage which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> his Enemies, and tho&s;e that envied him, might have upon him, during his Ab&s;ence from <HI>Vienna:</HI> But for all this he found he had rea&s;on enough to be content with the manner of his u&s;age, the King allow'd him a double Franchi&s;e, and paid all the Charges of his Hou&s;e at his Arrival: The Two Queens honoured the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> and her Daughters, with &s;everal Pre&s;ents; they favoured him in every thing, yet neverthele&s;s he could not forbear to &s;ay proudly, that he hoped he &s;hould not tarry there above a year, and that it &s;hould not be his Fault if he did not depart &s;ooner. He was a fine Gentleman, had abundance of Wit, Penetration and Conduct; but he was of a prodigious bigne&s;s, and found him&s;elf mightily incommoded by it: He &s;ometimes could not help changing his Countenance, when he hap|pen'd to be in Company with People whom he was not well acquainted with, when they looked &s;tedfa&s;tly upon him. The Court of <HI>Spain</HI> had
<PB N="57" REF="57">&s;uch favourable Inclinations for him, that they readily granted him whatever he de&s;ired; but they could not forbear now and then to promi&s;e him &s;ome things which they never performed, and he him&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible that they never would. He was frequently vexed upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, &s;aying, That it was his Misfortune not to know what he might depend upon: He was concerned at the Mi&s;ery to which all &s;orts of People were reduced at <HI>Madrid</HI>; and I have heard him fre|quently &s;ay, That whatever Idea's a Man might form to him&s;elf of the Publick Grievances, yet they infinitely fell &s;hort of what they really were, when he came to &s;ee them; and that for his part, he could not imagine what Remedies they could apply to them. It is indeed true, that Funds were wanting for the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Exigencies, and that they were forced to borrow five thou&s;and Pi&s;tols for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of &s;ome Troops that they thought convenient to &s;end to <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Frontiers of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Apprehen&s;ions they had at Court of the De&s;igns of our King. I have heard it often &s;aid, That the Couriers could not go, for want of Money to defray the Expences of their Journey, although they had Affairs of great Con&s;equence to di&s;patch; and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez,</HI> who knew this better than any body, repre&s;ented to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> that there was a perfect nece&s;&s;ity to take full Cognizance of the Funds, upon which they might depend for the time to come. The Duke reli&s;hing this Propo&s;al, ordered a true Scheme of the King's Revenues to be brought before him: But the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Finances,</HI> and &s;ome others, after they had deliberated, as their Fa&s;hion was, upon the matter, that is, with a regard only to

their own proper Intere&s;ts, an&s;wered all with one Con&s;ent, That what he demanded of them was the Work of &s;everal Years. This An&s;wer was &s;ufficient to make him abandon the Underta|king; for the Duke never cared to engage him|&s;elf in any bu&s;ine&s;s that was of long continu|ance; nay, he had &s;carce Re&s;olution enough to go through tho&s;e things which he was obliged &s;uddenly to begin, and as &s;oon to fini&s;h. One of the be&s;t Examples I can produce to ju&s;tify this, is his leaving the <HI>Camarera Major, Don Gero|nimo de Eguya,</HI> and the Confe&s;&s;or, quietly to en|joy their Places, without endeavouring to re|move them; whether it were becau&s;e he de&s;pi&s;ed them, or that he imagined them to be too pow|erful to attempt any thing again&s;t them; the Weakne&s;s which he &s;hew'd in that Rancounter, &s;erved only to increa&s;e their Courage and Haugh|tine&s;s; and they went &s;o far at la&s;t, as not to fear him at all: They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with a &s;trong Aver&s;ion to him, and in&s;inuated &s;everal things into him that were quite oppo&s;ite to the Duke's Intentions. He was well enough &s;en&s;ible of it, but his natural in&s;en&s;ibility hindered him from re&s;enting it: His Gentlene&s;s rend'red him contemptible both to one and the other, but par|ticularly to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> who &s;poke often to the King about him, and explain|ed her &s;elf upon her con&s;tant Chapter, the Duke, in &s;uch bitter Language, that he being in|formed of it, as he certainly was, every body had Rea&s;on to wonder how he was able to en|dure it.</P>
<P>This ill-natur'd old Beldame had only a &s;eem|ing, and not a real Kindne&s;s for the Young Queen, and it la&s;ted &s;o &s;hort a time, that her

u&s;age &s;erved only to make the Queen &s;en&s;ible, that &s;he knew how to moderate her &s;elf well enough, when &s;he &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary for her intere&s;t &s;o to do. But as this was indeed a true con&s;traint upon her Nature, and &s;he could not counterfeit the lea&s;t &s;weetne&s;s of Temper, with|out a great Reluctance; &s;o &s;he &s;oon rea&s;&s;umed her proper Character, and her Per&s;ecutions be|came more frequent than ever. The Queen, utterly impatient of this Rigorous Deportment, charmed the King one day, by all manner of tender engaging Care&s;&s;es, till &s;he found him in a Humour to deny her nothing. After &s;ome time had pa&s;t, &s;he told him, That if &s;he was dear to him, &s;he conjured him to give her &s;ome te&s;ti|mony of it, that was as well nece&s;&s;ary for her Health, as the Satisfaction of her Mind.

This Demand &s;ur|prized him, and it was a pretty while before he returned her any An&s;wer: but knowing that this had di&s;quieted her a long time, he told her at la&s;t, That what &s;he reque&s;ted had never any Pre&s;ident, and that no Queen had ever changed her <HI>Camarera Major. Ah, Sir,</HI> replied the Queen, <HI>your Maje&s;ty has &s;hew'n me &s;everal Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ours for which none of your Predece&s;&s;ors have left any Example; and cannot you then conde&s;cend to grant me this?

<P><PB N="60" REF="62">
The fir&s;t Journey &s;he made, was to ac|quaint the Queen-Mother with the News, not at all que&s;tioning, but that &s;he would almo&s;t &s;hew as much Joy upon this occa&s;ion as her &s;elf.</P>
<P>But &s;he was not a little &s;urprized to find her &s;o re&s;erved and cold, as if the matter were ab&s;o|lutely indifferent to her. This mightily perplex|ed her, and &s;o &s;he di&s;covered the whole Affair to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, who took pains to put her in heart again, by making her &s;en|&s;ible, that the Queen-Mother was only appre|hen&s;ive of &s;eeing this place filled by &s;ome other Lady, who might perhaps be full as di&s;agreeable to her as the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> was; and that &s;he was of Opinion, that if &s;he propo&s;ed &s;ome body to her, whom &s;he liked, &s;he would open her &s;elf more clearly to her. The Young Queen replied, That &s;he would do nothing in this bu&s;ine&s;s, without the Advice of the Queen her Mother-in-Law; That &s;he was minded to have &s;aid as much to her, when &s;he fir&s;t di&s;|cour&s;ed her about it, but that &s;he &s;eemed to be &s;o indifferent in the matter, that &s;he had not Confidence enough to explain her &s;elf farther. The Queen judged it would be expedient to ac|quaint the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> with this Affair, for fear, le&s;t if &s;he made a My&s;tery of it, and he &s;hould afterwards happen to di&s;cover it, he might look upon him&s;elf to be di&s;obliged, and re&s;ent it &s;o much, as to endeavour to hinder the Accompli&s;hment of it: But &s;he &s;till lay under &s;ome Perplexities, becau&s;e &s;he fancied &s;he did not under&s;tand the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language well enough, to be able to hold any long Conver&s;ation in it with the Duke, and this was a nice Ca&s;e where|in
<PB N="61" REF="63">
&s;he ought to explain her &s;elf clearly and intel|ligibly. She was yet more afraid, that the <HI>Ca|marera,</HI> who was always a li&s;tening in all parts of her Apartment, and who &s;ometimes &s;lipt in|to Corners, where, without being perceived, &s;he under&s;tood and &s;aw every thing that pa&s;t, would go and di&s;cover what &s;he &s;aid concerning her. The&s;e Rea&s;ons prevailed with her to charge one of her Women in whom &s;he repo&s;ed a great confidence, to go to <HI>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</HI> who was a near Relation of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and who be&s;ides expre&s;&s;ed a great Zeal for her Maje&s;ty, and de&s;ire him to acquaint the Chief Mini&s;ter with what had happened, and to tell him, That &s;ince the the Queen was re&s;olved to remove her <HI>Camerera,</HI> &s;he de&s;ired him to chu&s;e for her one of his Friends, of who&s;e Fidelity he was a&s;&s;ured; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in this Affair, to the end, that act|ing in Con&s;ort one with another, the bu&s;ine&s;s might &s;ucceed to their common Satisfaction. The Duke received the Honour the Queen did him, with a great deal of Re&s;pect and Acknow|ledgement, and &s;ent his Dutche&s;s that very Even|ing to return her his mo&s;t humble Thanks. When &s;he came to the Queen's Apartment, &s;he tarried till the other Ladies were gone out of the Room, that &s;he might have a better opportunity of making her Compliment.</P>
<P>The Queen, who knew very well, that the Dutche&s;s was &s;en&s;ible enough of the favourable Conde&s;centions &s;he had made on her &s;ide, was de&s;irous to be&s;tow the Place upon her; but the Affair did not &s;ucceed as &s;he imagined, becau&s;e that Lady had too much bu&s;ine&s;s upon her Hands to accept the Offer. <HI>I have de&s;igned it for you,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;ays the Queen, <HI>and I am of Opinion, that you will not be unwilling to &s;erve me.</HI> The Dutche&s;s thanked her, as in Duty obliged, and told her, She could wi&s;h with all her heart that &s;he was in a condition to accept this Honour, and that no body in the World &s;hould &s;erve her Maje&s;ty more faithfully than &s;he would; but her Health was &s;o ill, that it would not permit her to render her tho&s;e Services in which that Place, as well as her own inclinations, would engage her. But the Queen continuing to pre&s;s her &s;till, &s;he told her, That although this Con&s;ideration was laid a&s;ide, yet &s;he had another of equal im|portance, which &s;he could never di&s;pence with, That &s;he had Seven Daughters, upon who&s;e Education and good Conduct all her Cares were be&s;tow'd; and therefore &s;he reque&s;ted her Ma|je&s;ty to think of her no more: However, &s;he dur&s;t a&s;&s;ure her, &s;he believed the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> to be the mo&s;t proper Per&s;on to exe|cute this Place; That &s;he was a Lady of great Merit, and illu&s;trious Birth; that &s;he had for|merly been <HI>Governante</HI> to the Young King, and con&s;equently being &s;o well known to his Ma|je&s;ty, could more dexterou&s;ly humour and plea&s;e him than any one be&s;ides. The Queen very well approved of this Advice, and the Dutche&s;s after|wards withdrew. She gave her Husband an Account of what Conver&s;ation had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her and the Queen; but he was di&s;plea&s;ed to hear that &s;he had recommended the Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> becau&s;e he had already engaged him&s;elf in behalf of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque,</HI> and earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to &s;ee her advanc'd to this Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Confidence which the King repo&s;ed in <HI>de Eguya,</HI> would not permit him to conceal from

him the promi&s;e he made the Queen to remove the <HI>Camerera.</HI> He for his part omitted nothing that might turn off the intended blow; but he found the King was &s;o fully re&s;olved to &s;atisfie the Queen, that he perceived it would be to no purpo&s;e to u&s;e any importunities with him upon this Score: So all he could do in the matter, was only to acquaint the <HI>Camarera</HI> with what was de&s;igned again&s;t her, that &s;o &s;he might be the better provided to bear the &s;hock when it happened. She had &s;ome Su&s;picions of this be|fore, it being her principal Talent to penetrate into the mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs. This blow &s;en&s;ibly afflicted her, and &s;he could not forbear to &s;peak to the Queen about it. <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I &s;hould reckon my &s;elf extreamly unfortunate, if my Zeal for your Maje&s;ty &s;hould ever happen to di&s;plea&s;e you: I have &s;poken to you with more Zeal, and per|haps with more Freedom than any one has done; neverthele&s;s, my de&s;ign was only to in&s;pire you with a de&s;ire of learning all our Fa&s;hions, that &s;o you might ab&s;olutely po&s;&s;e&s;s the Heart and good Inclinations of the King: The Liberty I took has appeared too a&s;&s;uming; I have drawn your di&s;plea&s;ure upon my &s;elf, by endea|vouring to de&s;erve your Affection; and I am informed at la&s;t, that your Maje&s;ty de&s;ires to &s;ee my Place filled by another.</HI> The Queen, &s;urprized to &s;ee that the Affair &s;he had communicated to &s;o few Per&s;ons, had taken Air, an&s;wered coldly, <HI>It is not worth the while, Madam, to trouble your &s;elf about what People &s;ay; few Per&s;ons know my Thoughts; and 'tis a thing u&s;ually practi&s;ed in Courts, to invent News, and then to relate it as if it were true.</HI> The <HI>Ca|marera</HI> was not able to draw any Di&s;coveries from this Conver&s;ation; but whether her Con|&s;cience reproached her for the Conduct &s;he had

u&s;ed, or el&s;e &s;he had been informed of the Queen's De&s;igns before <HI>de Eguya</HI> &s;poke to her about them; it was &s;ome time ago &s;ince &s;he &s;u&s;pected that &s;he was to be removed, and upon that Con&s;ideration, having examined all the La|dies of the Court, who gave her the greate&s;t Jealou&s;y, &s;he found Three, <HI>viz.</HI> the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infantado.</HI> This is the Cau&s;e that &s;he took her mea&s;ures a long time before, and &s;poke of the&s;e Three Ladies in very di&s;obliging Terms before the Queen, whenever an occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it &s;elf. She accu&s;ed the Marchione&s;s <HI>de los Velez</HI> for her Haughtine&s;s in all her Acti|ons, and for her in&s;upportable Severity. She pretended, that the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> hated all the <HI>French</HI> &s;o mortally, that when &s;he hap|pen'd to meet any of that Nation, &s;he turned her Eyes a&s;ide, that &s;he might not behold them; and that &s;he valued her &s;elf &s;o mightily upon the &s;core of her high Birth and Vertue, that &s;he had always &s;omething or other to &s;ay again&s;t all the World: And then as for the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infan|tado,</HI> &s;he repre&s;ented her as an old doting Wo|man, who at the be&s;t had never any great &s;hare of Wit, and had now totally lo&s;t it, by rea&s;on of her great Age. She was not content to &s;peak of them after this manner, but engaged all the <HI>French</HI> Women, who were near the Queen, to in&s;inuate the &s;ame Opinion into her, and they acquitted them&s;elves in the matter as well as they could, out of hopes, that if the Dutche&s;s conti|nued in her Po&s;t &s;till, &s;he would take care to con|&s;ider them for their good Services.</P>
<P>What they &s;aid to the Queen upon this occa|&s;ion, made but a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion upon her

Mind; and the fir&s;t time &s;he could find an op|portunity to di&s;cour&s;e the Queen-Mother about it, &s;he acquainted her with her De&s;igns in fa|vour of the Marchione&s;s <HI>de los Velez</HI>; but &s;he expre&s;&s;ed as great an indifference at this Mo|tion as &s;he did at fir&s;t. This gave the Queen no &s;mall Affliction; &s;o &s;he imagined that &s;he ought to inform her of every thing that was laid to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI>'s Charge, as well upon the Affair of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> whom &s;he cau&s;ed to be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, as &s;everal other things that rendered her odious. After this, &s;he added the Particulars of the Deport|ment &s;he had u&s;ed towards her. But the Queen-Mother pretended, as if all this were News to her, and &s;till continued to &s;peak very kindly of the <HI>Camarera</HI>; not that &s;he had the lea&s;t kind|ne&s;s for her in reality; for &s;he had not forgotten how deeply &s;he had been engaged in the In|tere&s;ts of <HI>Don Juan</HI>; and &s;he had not as yet for|given the Memory of that Prince for the Trou|bles he brought upon her.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of her u&s;ing this Conduct with the Queen, was only to exclude the Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">Infan|tado,</HI> whom &s;he did not greatly care for. She thought with her &s;elf, that if &s;he de&s;ired to ob|lige the Queen to take a <HI>Camarera</HI> from her Hands, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for her to te&s;tify no Aver&s;ion for her that was to fill that Place; and that the Queen being de&s;irous to be &s;e|conded by her, would demand of her whom &s;he pitched upon, and &s;o take a Per&s;on of her own chu&s;ing. The Young Queen was aware of her Mother-in Law's De&s;igns: However, &s;he pre|tended to know nothing of them, &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="66" REF="68">
that &s;uch a one would be always obliged to do as the Queen-Mother directed her: Having therefore a particular inclination for the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;ound the King's Sentiments upon that Affair, and pro|po&s;ed her to him; but he expre&s;s'd an extraor|dinary Antipathy to her: <HI>If,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you knew the Marchione&s;s</HI> de Los Velez <HI>as well as I do, I am con|fident you would never think of placing her &s;o near you; She has been my Governante, and is the only Per&s;on in the World whom I dread mo&s;t.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> de&s;ired no more to &s;ee her in that Station than the King did, and &s;hew'd as great a di&s;like to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infantado</HI>; all their Votes concurr'd in behalf of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Al|buquerque,</HI> and it was agreed upon at la&s;t, to per|&s;uade the Queen that &s;he ought to chu&s;e her.</P>
<P>This Choice had infallibly &s;ucceeded, if the Queen could have cured her &s;elf of tho&s;e di&s;|agreeable impre&s;&s;ions which the <HI>Camarera</HI> had made upon her in relation to that Dutche&s;s; She often thought of the imperious Humour that was attributed to her, of the pretended Aver&s;ion &s;he had to the <HI>French</HI>; but e&s;pecially of what the King had told her, That when once the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> was removed, and another put in|to her Place, &s;he mu&s;t never think of turning her off. She was per&s;uaded, that &s;he &s;hould be no Gainer by the change, if &s;he pitched upon the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque:</HI> Nay, that it migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o happen to her, as to be a con&s;iderable lo&s;er by it.

&s;earching after one, &s;he was told of the Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>de Eytona,</HI> who was a Woman of Solid Ver|tue, great Merit, and had abundance of Wit and Gallantry. In fine, &s;he was every way &s;o well Accompli&s;h'd, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for her Maje&s;ty to have her near her; and by the Re|lations &s;he had at the Queen-Mother's Court, and with the Chief Mini&s;ter, &s;he could not chu&s;e but plea&s;e both Parties alike. The King &s;hew'd no oppo&s;ition to her, and the Queen, who knew her, loved her already; &s;o that &s;he was mighty joyful to meet with one whom &s;he liked &s;o well. But this Joy did not continue long; for the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Eytona</HI> fell &s;ick, and died a few days after. The Young Queen was &s;en&s;ibly Afflicted at this Lo&s;s, and not knowing where to make a better choice, &s;he came back again to the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he comprehended no difference between the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI>; And as for the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infantado,</HI> &s;he perceived well enough that &s;he was not fit for her.</P>
<P>But now to propo&s;e the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> was to attempt a thing that could never &s;ucceed, for the Rea&s;ons I have already mentio|ned. The Marchione&s;s, who perceived them better than any body, could not endure to be &s;o long expo&s;ed to an Exclu&s;ion that was &s;o very di&s;obliging to her; So &s;he went to find out the Queen, and returned her Thanks for her great Favours; but &s;he told her, That her Age, and the Trouble &s;he had had with the King, when &s;he was Governante to him, gave her &s;o great a di&s;reli&s;h for the Court, that &s;he could by means reconcile her &s;elf to it, and therefore de&s;ired her to think of her no more. All the&s;e Difficulties

&s;eemed to ari&s;e for the Satisfaction of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> or at lea&s;t, they proved the occa&s;ion why &s;he continued &s;till in her Place; and that the Queen, utterly wearied to find &s;o many di&s;appointments in her way, was come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that &s;he was no longer de&s;irous to remove her. The Queen Mother all the while intrigued more than &s;he, becau&s;e &s;he earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to have that Lady turned out of the Palace.</P>
<P>What &s;till contributed to make the Young Queen le&s;s concerned for the matter, was, that her Mind was taken up with new Troubles, that were more pre&s;&s;ing upon her than tho&s;e &s;he received from the <HI>Camarera</HI>; I mean, the Ap|prehen&s;ions they had at Court of a Rupture be|tween the two Crowns. The Queen remained in|con&s;olable, when &s;he con&s;idered, that the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> of which &s;he was, as it were, the Seal, was going to be broken. The Love &s;he had for <HI>France,</HI> and the Obligations that fa&s;tened her to <HI>Spain,</HI> ballanced all her Inclinations; and &s;he often &s;hed Tears, out of a fear only of &s;ee|ing the War renewed.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King pretended, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had pillaged and abu&s;ed his Subjects in &s;everal places, and either burnt or taken many <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els; That they returned him no An&s;wer at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to the Complaints he had made; That the Marque&s;s <HI>de Borgomaine,</HI> who re&s;ided at <HI>London,</HI> in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> ob&s;erved no manner of mea&s;ures; nay, not even tho&s;e that Decency pre&s;cribes; That he had made a League in the Name of the King his Ma&s;ter, with the King of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t <HI>France</HI>; That he was well informed, that as he was upon his

departure to go Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Vienna,</HI> he had received private Orders to &s;tay &s;ome time in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> to try if he could per&s;wade the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to do the mo&s;t prejudicial things they could do to <HI>France.</HI> The King, provoked at &s;o clande&s;tine a Conduct, and &s;o extraordinary in the mid&s;t of a Peace, which he had not infringed the lea&s;t on his part, was re&s;olved to act according to his u&s;ual Ju&s;tice and Equity; and finding him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the&s;e Re&s;entments, he had no|thing to incline him to believe, that he was obliged to part with any of his Rights.</P>
<P>He ordered his Gallies to put to Sea, with an expre&s;s Command to make tho&s;e of <HI>Spain</HI> give them the fir&s;t Gun whenever they met them. He knew that this Affair had been regulated at the &s;ame time when <HI>Philip</HI> IV had agreed that his Amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould never appear in Publick with tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI>; and he made the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> be acquainted, that the Conduct he u&s;ed during the Peace, was &s;o oppo&s;ite to Peace it &s;elf, that he &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to &s;eek out all Advantages on his &s;ide, as he found it expedient.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> for his part, complained of the exact Severity that was &s;hown him in the &s;malle&s;t matters, alledging, that when the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King were to have adju&s;ted with tho&s;e that came from <HI>Spain,</HI> the Limits of what had been yielded up by the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had refu&s;ed to Treat with the Deputies of <HI>Spain,</HI> as long as the Catholick King &s;hould take upon him the Qua|lity of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy:</HI> They added a De|claration to this Refu&s;al. That if within a cer|tain time a&s;&s;igned, they did not Treat by Ver|tue of another Commi&s;&s;ion, where this Title was

not in&s;erted, they would immediately put the King of <HI>France</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Territories and Rights which belonged to him. So that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was content to cut off the Titles he u&s;ually a&s;&s;umes with an <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This League, about which the Marque&s;s <HI>de Bor|gomaine</HI> made &s;uch a bu&s;tle and &s;tir in <HI>England,</HI> was at la&s;t concluded with <HI>Spain.</HI> It was a mu|tual Engagement on both &s;ides, whereby they obliged them&s;elves to defend one another, in what place &s;oever they &s;hould happen to be attack'd. For this end <HI>England</HI> was to furni&s;h Eight Thou|&s;and Foot, and Thirty Men of War; and <HI>Spain</HI> was obliged to &s;end an Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns every Month into <HI>Flanders,</HI> to keep the Gari&s;ons there in a good condition, and have Twelve Thou&s;and Men in Pay in <HI>Champagne.</HI> They were in good hopes, that the Emperor and the <HI>Hollander</HI> would likewi&s;e enter into the League. <HI>Don Pedro Ronquillo,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary of <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent a Courier, with a Ratifi|cation of the Treaty, which was received at <HI>Ma|drid</HI> on the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> 1680.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t People were very well &s;atisfied, when they &s;aw the &s;everal Motions on both &s;ides, that the War would infallibly be kindled &s;omewhere or other in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> had demanded to be recalled home, and that ano|ther Governor might be &s;ent to &s;upply his Place. The unconcern'd Temper, as well as the Natural Slowne&s;s of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> held the matter a con|&s;iderable time in &s;u&s;pence, without giving them|&s;elves the trouble to determine it. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazes</HI> was fir&s;t pitch'd upon to be &s;ent thither: but as &s;oon as he received Advice of it, he endeavour'd all he could to get him&s;elf excu|&s;ed,
<PB N="71" REF="73">
out of an Apprehen&s;ion that they would en|gage him at the &s;ame time to contract va&s;t Debts, to which his Thrifty Humour gave him an in|vincible Aver&s;ion. Be&s;ides this, they found it a difficult matter to meet with any Subject who was to their Mind: The Report ran, That the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> would go to command there in Chief; Afterwards it was &s;aid, the Duke of <HI>Newburg</HI> would be the Man, for whom the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana</HI> did &s;everal good Offices. After they had deliberated a long time about the Merits of the&s;e two Competitors, at la&s;t they ca&s;t their Eyes upon Prince <HI>Alexander Farne&s;e</HI>; he obtained the Preference, and was named about the beginning of <HI>July.</HI> He was Brother to the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> and was about Three&s;core Year old; the Gout very much troubled him, and the Talne&s;s of his Stature was very Extraordinary: He had been a long time devoted to <HI>Spain,</HI> and particularly to the Queen-Mother, at the juncture when &s;he had tho&s;e great Differences with <HI>Don Juan:</HI> He had been General of the Cavalry in <HI>E&s;tramadura</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed for a very great Soldier, although 'tis certain he had but very little Expe|rience, and the Management of his private Af|fairs &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated it; for he ow'd every body Money, paid &s;eldom, and had not a Farthing by him: his Profu&s;ene&s;s and his Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es ruined him, and although, after all, he had really a great E&s;tate, yet it was mi&s;erably in|cumbred. It was the General Opinion here, that if the War commenced, <HI>Flanders</HI> would be the fir&s;t Victim; and this made them believe, that it would be le&s;s ignominious for <HI>Spain</HI> to &s;uffer this Lo&s;s, when an <HI>Italian</HI> was Governor of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> than if a <HI>Spaniard</HI> were there. In &s;hort,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
it could be nothing el&s;e but this Con&s;ideration only, that could po&s;&s;ibly induce them to believe they did well to fill this Po&s;t with a Man, who never had managed as yet any Affair of that va&s;t importance as the&s;e were. They bargained with <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Ca&s;tile,</HI> for the Sum of Three Hun|dred Thou&s;and Crowns, which was to be re|mitted to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> for the payment of the Troops: And after Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> had received the Thirty Thou&s;and Crowns which the King or|dered to be given him, to bear the Expence of his Voyage, he parted on the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> to go and take Shipping at the <HI>Groyne</HI> in <HI>Galicia.</HI> He took along with him abundance of Volun|tiers, and a numerous Train of Dome&s;ticks: He &s;ent a Courier into <HI>France,</HI> to get nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;ports, and left the Court in &s;uch ha&s;te, that he forgot to carry with him the Patent for his Government. It was not very long before he heartily repented for &s;o doing, and he pre&s;t earne&s;tly to have it: However, they promi&s;ed him one, but deferr'd to expedite it; &s;o that he could only be &s;aid to be Governor for the <HI>In|terim</HI>; and it was believed, with Rea&s;on enough that he would not be well plea&s;ed with this U&s;age. He had intru&s;ted &s;ome Per&s;ons at <HI>Ma|drid</HI> to &s;ollicite this Affair for him; but they refu&s;ed the Expeditions, when the Court would oblige them to take them in &s;uch a Form; and after many Petitions on their &s;ide, and &s;everal Conte&s;ts with the Mini&s;ters about it, it was not at la&s;t in&s;erted into the Patent after what manner he was made Governor.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince departed from <HI>Madrid:</HI> with &s;o little Money, according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, that he was &s;carce arrived at the
<PB N="73" REF="75">
<HI>Groyne,</HI> but he di&s;patch'd a Courier away to the Court with &s;ome Letters, wherein he demanded Money to perform his Voyage. They an&s;wered him very coldly, That they would advi&s;e him not to defer the day of his departure, and that they could by no means believe, that he had al|ready &s;pent his Thirty Thou&s;and Crowns. He embarked immediately, accompanied by &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els belonging to <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> which tran&s;ported five hundred new rai&s;ed Men, that had been levied in <HI>Galicia,</HI> and were commanded to guard the <HI>Frontiers.</HI> The People in <HI>Flanders</HI> had not for many Years &s;een any other Governour but <HI>Don Juan</HI>; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Government as his own till his Death; and although he was at &s;o great a di&s;tance, yet Couriers were &s;till di&s;patched to him, to receive his Orders, even in the mo&s;t im|portant Conjunctures. To &s;ay the truth, the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> had been &s;ent thither, as I have already ob&s;erved in the beginning of the&s;e Memoirs, in the Place of that Prince; and he obtained a General Patent, without &s;pecifying in it, that it was only by a Commi&s;&s;ion; but the Queen-Mother would have it &s;o, on purpo&s;e to di&s;gu&s;t <HI>Don Juan.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity there was for Money in <HI>Flanders,</HI> obliged the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> to &s;earch with all imaginable Application &s;ome means or other to furni&s;h them with &s;ome; and he tried &s;everal without meeting any Succe&s;s. <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Ca&s;tile</HI> immediately promis'd to remit Thirty Thou&s;and Crowns thither, and afterwards engaged to make a return of Eighteen Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Florins</HI> more; upon which con&s;ideration they were to give him Two Hun|dred Thou&s;and Crowns in Hand, and to pay
<PB N="74" REF="76">
him the re&s;t at different times upon A&s;&s;ignations, which in all probability would never have been paid to him. He que&s;tioning it very much, was not willing to be their Fool, and re&s;olved to &s;end no Money to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> but accordingly as he re|ceived it at <HI>Madrid.</HI> They failed to perform the Promi&s;e they had made him, to pay him Two Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns down upon the Nail; and he, for his part, failed them in the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now how was it po&s;&s;ible to draw &s;uch a Sum as this out of the King's Trea&s;ury, when it was totally exhau&s;ted? The inferior Officers of his Hou&s;e having tarried for their Wages longer than they could well do, except they reduced them|&s;elves to down-right Beggary, would have thrown up their Liveries, being re&s;olved to quit the Service, unle&s;s they had been partly detained by Menaces, and partly by fair promi&s;es to &s;ee them paid, if they continued in it &s;till. As for People of Quality, they could not tell what to do: After they had pawn'd their Jewels, their Plate, nay, even their Canopies of State, and their wearing Apparel, they found they had now no more Money or Credit left. The Bankers were not in a better condition, and the Mer|chants had neither Merchandize nor Money. The inconvenience of proclaiming Money, to go at a lower Price, was &s;en&s;ibly perceived every day more and more, and the Publick Mi&s;ery &s;till in|crea&s;ed. A Man cannot &s;ufficiently wonder that things of &s;o great a con&s;equence were managed with &s;o little con&s;ideration: Nay, matters were come to that pa&s;s, that in &s;everal Provinces they were forced to exchange Cattle for Corn, and Cloath for Linnen, becau&s;e there was not Money enough to circulate in the way of Trade. Heaven
<PB N="75" REF="77">
pitied the great Afflictions of tho&s;e People, and favoured them with a Plentiful Year; but the Price of Bread was not in the lea&s;t dimini|&s;hed, either through the Negligence or Villany of the Magi&s;trates, who were &s;o far from en|couraging the Corn to be brought into the great Cities, that they under-hand hindred it from being carried to tho&s;e Places. The Queen-Mo|ther's Hou&s;hold began to find in their turn, the Effects of the&s;e Di&s;orders; &s;he had been hitherto very well paid, and her Dome&s;ticks received their <HI>Racions,</HI> that is to &s;ay, their Allowances, either in Money or Provi&s;ions; and now when they pre&s;t the Trea&s;urers to take care they might have them, they were told, that they might go and vi&s;it the Che&s;ts of the Trea&s;ury, if they plea&s;ed, which at pre&s;ent were all open, becau&s;e they had no Money within.</P>
<P>So many particular as well as private Calami|ties, were yet increa&s;ed by the Ravage and De|&s;olation the Plague made in <HI>Andalu&s;ia.</HI> It is not long ago &s;ince it was altogether uninhabited along the Sea-Coa&s;ts from <HI>Malaga</HI> to <HI>Alicant.</HI> The Kingdom of <HI>Granada</HI> was not free from this Pe&s;tilence, which &s;pread it &s;elf about <HI>Sevil</HI> and <HI>Corduba,</HI> and in <HI>E&s;tramadura.</HI> It was immediately perceived at Port St. <HI>Mary,</HI> but they would not take any publick notice of it, till after the depar|ture of the <HI>Flota</HI> for the <HI>Indies,</HI> for fear of &s;poiling Commerce. If it had not been for this con&s;ide|ration, it had been vi&s;ibly perceived much &s;ooner. The difficulties &s;till increa&s;ed as to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Trade, and People were apprehen&s;ive that their Letters, Commodities, and Goods, carried the infection with them. It is natural enough for Men to u&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary Precaution again&s;t &s;o dangerous a Di&s;temper as this was.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">
I have already ob&s;erved that the Duke <HI>de Me|dina-Celi</HI> would have fain engaged the King to part with his Confe&s;&s;or, but that finding &s;o ma|ny difficulties appear in the way, he de&s;i&s;ted from his de&s;ign: But Father <HI>Francis de Relux</HI> had not, for his part, forgotten the ill Offices that the Duke endeavoured to do him. He di&s;&s;embled his Re&s;entments, becau&s;e he was not as yet &s;o well &s;ettled in the King's good inclinations, as to ven|ture to cope with the Chief Mini&s;ter. But as &s;oon as he found him&s;elf upon &s;ure grounds, he &s;poke to <HI>de Eguya,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> to intere&s;t them in his quarrel, out of a de&s;ire he had to make the Duke &s;en&s;ible of the Effects of his Power. The old Dutche&s;s was not ignorant that the Duke hated her, and that he pa&s;&s;ionately de|&s;ired to &s;ee another in her Place: This in&s;pired her with a mortal Aver&s;ion to him; and &s;o the&s;e Three Per&s;ons being always united, rai&s;ed a con|&s;iderable Faction again&s;t him: But that of the Confe&s;&s;or was carried on more &s;ecretly, and con|&s;equently was more dangerous. It often happens, that a Man pur&s;ues his Revenge freely, when he may &s;afely do it under the Pretence of Devotion; And this was the Ca&s;e of Father <HI>de Relux</HI>; for he ince&s;&s;antly attacked the King in his mo&s;t tender part, his Con&s;cience. <Q REND="inline">He repre&s;ented to him the Mi&s;ery of his People, the Extremity of the State, the Di&s;order and Mi&s;carriages, which were &s;o far from being remedied, that they were openly encouraged; that no Grievances were redre&s;s'd, that every thing came to ruin; that if his Maje&s;ty was &s;en&s;ible that he had not Power and Experience enough to regulate Affairs of him&s;elf, and to take the Reins of the Govern|ment into his own hands, he ought at lea&s;t, to
<PB N="77" REF="79">
intru&s;t them with a Mini&s;ter, who would give him an hone&s;t and faithful Account of his Em|ployment: That the debate was not now about a trivial matter, but that his Everla&s;ting Salva|tion lay at &s;take; that God, who makes and pre|&s;erves Kings in their Sovereign Authority, ex|pects that Kings &s;hould perform their Duties; that they are obliged to cheri&s;h their Subjects as their Children, and to make them happy as far as it lies in their Power; that the Duke <HI>de Me|dina Celi</HI> only regarded his own private Inte|re&s;ts, and minded nothing but his Family, which was very numerous, and the advancing of his Relations, whil&s;t the re&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> groaned un|der the heavy weight of Sub&s;idies, Impo&s;ts, and a thou&s;and other Vexations, which were pur|po&s;ely rai&s;ed to exhau&s;t them; that he was ob|liged in Con&s;cience to inform him, that unle&s;s he vigorou&s;ly endeavour'd to apply proper Re|medies to the&s;e Evils, it was his Duty to deny him Ab&s;olution.</Q> The King, who continued for &s;ome time a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e Menaces, de|manded of him, whether he did not &s;peak all the&s;e afflicting things only to try him? The other an&s;wer'd, That he was &s;o far from entertaining any &s;uch thoughts, that were &s;o little conform|able to the Re&s;pect he owed him, that he would willingly have &s;acrificed his own Life, to have been exempted from the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peak|ing to him after &s;o frank a manner. The King was very Pen&s;ive, and &s;pent &s;everal days in con|&s;ulting him&s;elf, without knowing what to re|&s;olve upon: He lov'd the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> exceedingly, and at la&s;t &s;ent for him to come to him. So having &s;hut him up with him&s;elf in his Clo&s;et, he fairly acquanted him with the
<PB N="78" REF="80">
occa&s;ion of his Unea&s;iene&s;s, and with his Ap|prehen&s;ions in relation to his Salvation: He recounted to him every thing that pa&s;t be|tween his Confe&s;&s;or and him, and how he re|fu&s;ed to Ab&s;olve him, becau&s;e of the general di&s;order of Affairs; and at la&s;t told the Duke, He had now &s;ent for him to comfort him with good Rea&s;ons. The Chief Mini&s;ter li&s;tned very re&s;pectfully to him all the while, and would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be tran&s;ported with any Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Confe&s;&s;or's Severity, for fear the King &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the true Motives of that Heat. On the contrary he agreed, <Q REND="inline">That he was in|deed a Man of Sincerity, and that his Advices &s;eemed to proceed from a good intent: But then he added, That he was a Monk, and had no manner of Experience in the World: That <HI>Don Juan</HI> had drawn him out of a Convent, where he lay buried; That he never had any Conver&s;ation but with Monks, like him&s;elf; that he was dazled with the Po&s;t to which, by the Favour of <HI>Don Juan</HI> he had been elevated all on the &s;udden; that his Head was giddy, and that he knew not how to make any diffe|rence between things and times, although this was an Article ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the Con|duct of Souls; that he placed the King's Soul in a parallel with that of a private Man; that he agreed indeed, that in the &s;ight of God one were as valuable as the other, and that all the difference that was to be found be|tween them, proceeded only from the diver&s;ity of their Works; but then every Man had a particular way to &s;ave him&s;elf; that a Prince ought to live like a Prince, and a private Man like a private Man, and &s;o after the &s;ame man+ner, <PB N="79" REF="81">
a Secular like a Secular, and a Religious like a Religious; that Father <HI>Relux,</HI> who&s;e Ca|pacity was very narrow, confounded all E&s;tates, and even lo&s;t him&s;elf in this Chaos; that his Maje&s;ty ought not to be di&s;turbed at what he had told him, and e&s;pecially lea&s;t of all in the pre&s;ent Affairs, becau&s;e he a&s;&s;ured him, for his part, that he would not lo&s;e a moment to &s;et them in the be&s;t Order imaginable; that in truth, it was nece&s;&s;ary to allow &s;ome time for the performance of this; that let a Man's Zeal be never &s;o earne&s;t for the Publick Good, yet he cannot effect it immediately, &s;ince it is full as difficult a matter to remedy Grievances, as 'tis ea&s;ie to de&s;ire the removal of them; but that &s;ince the Confe&s;&s;or had troubled him&s;elf with &s;everal things, which did not at all belong to him, if the King would be plea&s;ed to take his Advice, he would provide him with one who was more capable of the Po&s;t than F. <HI>Relux,</HI> and would never torment him with imperti|nent Scruples.</Q></P>
<P>The Duke found it an ea&s;ie matter to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty to embrace a thing that would &s;et his Con&s;cience at re&s;t; and the King had con|&s;ented that very moment to the removal of the Confe&s;&s;or, if he had not judged it nece&s;&s;ary to take the Advice of <HI>Don Geronimo de Eguya,</HI> and &s;o he told the Duke, that he would make a few Reflections as was requi&s;ite, upon the matter. <HI>De Eguya</HI> coming to wait upon the King, he communicated his De&s;igns to him. After the &s;trict Union that was between this Favourite, the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and Father <HI>Relux,</HI> there was little probability that he would con&s;ent to his Removal, but as he preferr'd his own Intere&s;ts
<PB N="80" REF="82">
to tho&s;e of other Per&s;ons, and only &s;erved others out of a Re&s;pect to his own Advantage: So he found, that the Confe&s;&s;or was &s;o devoted to the <HI>Camarera Mayor,</HI> and that &s;he &s;o re&s;olutely &s;wore the Downfall of the Duke, that if this Combi|nation continued much longer, the Duke would infalllibly fall under the weight of it: That his Succe&s;&s;or might perhaps have le&s;s favourable Di&s;|po&s;itions towards him, and that he had better &s;acrifice the Confe&s;&s;or to the Mini&s;ter, than the Mini&s;ter to the Confe&s;&s;or. The&s;e Rea&s;ons ap|pear'd &s;o well-grounded, that in&s;tead of in&s;piring other Sentiments into the King, he fortified tho&s;e he had already, and this was enough to ruin the Father Confe&s;&s;or to all intents and purpo&s;es. They offer'd him, as they did before, the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Avila,</HI> in order to ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;ort of Decency in removing him; but he would not accept of it, and was content to continue a Coun&s;ellor in the Supreme Council of the Inqui&s;ition, where they are always obliged to have a <HI>Dominican.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> per&s;waded the King to take in his Place Father <HI>Bayona,</HI> a <HI>Dominican,</HI> Profe&s;|&s;or of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Alcala:</HI> He had expre&s;|&s;ed a great de&s;ire long before to &s;ee him placed in this Station, and had &s;poke of him ever &s;ince the Mini&s;try of <HI>Don Juan.</HI> That Prince, who had no kindne&s;s for him, would never admit him, &s;aying, that he was a <HI>French-man.</HI> He was indeed a Native of <HI>Navar,</HI> but that was the <HI>Spani&s;h Na|var:</HI> He entred into this Function towards the end of <HI>July.</HI> 'Tis very ob&s;ervable, that in the &s;pace of Five Years the King had Seven Confe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>This Alteration gave a fatal Blow to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and the Chief Mini&s;ter flatter'd him&s;elf, that &s;he would now leave the
<PB N="81" REF="83">
Palace in a &s;hort time. Since People &s;poke no more of &s;ending her away, and &s;he was well in|formed of every thing that pa&s;t, &s;he was of opi|nion, that they could not find any Lady who was fit to &s;ucceed her in her Place, and that &s;he &s;hould &s;till continue in it: But the Queen finding all her Stock of Patience &s;pent and gone, by rea&s;on of all tho&s;e occa&s;ions of Complaint &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted to give her, con&s;ented at la&s;t to receive the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> near her Per&s;on. But this was not till after &s;he had endeavoured to obtain the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> and even the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infantado.</HI> She &s;aw very well, that the Queen-Mother, and the Chief Mini&s;ter would never give their con&s;ent to it, and that it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for her to take a <HI>Camarera Major</HI> from their hands, or el&s;e to re&s;t contented with whom &s;he now had. Every one gave the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> a good Character, to efface tho&s;e ill impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had received again&s;t her. They took care to &s;atisfy her, <Q REND="inline">That &s;he was ingenious, and well-read in the World; that &s;he was not ignorant of any of the Cu&s;toms and Ceremonies of the Court; that &s;he would do her all good Of|fices imaginable, both with the Queen-Mother, and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI>; that &s;he had bet|ter make this Choice freely and voluntarily, than expre&s;s any repugnance to a thing which would unavoidably happen.</Q> The&s;e Rea&s;ons had their Effect; the Queen accepted her, and re|ceiv'd her very kindly when &s;he &s;aw her. She had concerted the matter with the Queen her Mo|ther-in-Law, and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi:</HI> But this was not &s;ufficient; the King's Con&s;ent re|mained &s;till to be gained; and he was no le&s;s aver&s;e to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque,</HI> than to the Mar|chione&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="84">
<HI>de Los Velez.</HI> The Prejudices he had re|ceived again&s;t this Dutche&s;s were of the &s;ame Na|ture with tho&s;e that had been in&s;inuated into the Queen. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and the Secretary <HI>de Eguya,</HI> were the Per&s;ons who had thus maliciou&s;ly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him again&s;t her; and nothing le&s;s than all the Authority of the Queen-Mother could make him re&s;olve to admit her into the Palace. She &s;poke to him of it at fir&s;t very &s;oftly and gently, but afterwards in a &s;tronger and higher Tone. She told him, <Q REND="inline">That it was high time for him now to know People of him&s;elf, and not to judge of their Merits by what was whi&s;pered to him concerning them; that any Per&s;on might be &s;o unhappy as to have &s;ecret Enemies, and that he was in a mi&s;erable condition to depend always upon tho&s;e that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed his Ear.</Q> When he perceived the Queen-Mother to &s;peak to him after this manner, he op|po&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s no longer, and &s;o every thing was adju&s;ted. <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon</HI> received Or|ders on the Twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> to acquaint the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> with the Queen's In|tentions, and with the Rea&s;ons &s;he pretended to A&s;&s;ign again&s;t her Conduct; that the be&s;t way &s;he could take, would be to obey without re|&s;i&s;tance, and to make it appear, as well as &s;he could, that &s;he retired of her own Accord.</P>
<P>This Blow did not &s;urprize her, &s;ince &s;he was long ago prepared for it, by the private Whi&s;|perings that were &s;pread about the Court. She an&s;wered <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon</HI> in a very few Words, and could not yet bring her &s;elf to be|lieve, that the King had given his Con&s;ent to her Removal: So &s;he was re&s;olved to be &s;atisfied of the truth of it from his own Mouth. She
<PB N="83" REF="85">
waited to &s;peak with him, as he was ju&s;t going to &s;it down to Dinner, and entertained him for &s;ome time in a low Tone; at la&s;t rai&s;ing her Voice to a higher pitch, &s;he demanded leave of him to retire. The King an&s;wered her aloud, <HI>I give you my Con&s;ent, Madam; you may retire as &s;oon as you plea&s;e.</HI> The&s;e few Words were like to di&s;|compo&s;e all the Con&s;tancy of the Dutche&s;s; &s;he changed Colour &s;everal times, and advanced a few &s;teps to &s;peak in private with him again; but he turned his back towards her, and asked &s;omething or other of the Duke <HI>de Uzeda.</HI> She went ha&s;ti|ly out of the Room, and retired to her Chamber to compo&s;e her &s;elf again; but the di&s;order &s;he was in, would not permit her to appear before the Queen till Evening; and then &s;he came to wait upon her at Supper, and at her going to Bed, with as unconcerned an Air, as if nothing had pa&s;&s;ed, though to counterfeit this, gave her a great deal of trouble, becau&s;e &s;he was throughly netled. The Queen was informed by the King of what he had &s;aid to her; however, &s;he had the Good|ne&s;s not to di&s;cover any thing of it, although &s;he had no Rea&s;on to be well-plea&s;ed with her.</P>
<P>Next Morning, the Dutche&s;s, who had not gone to Bed, but had pa&s;&s;ed the whole Night walking in her Chamber, with the Dutche&s;&s;es <HI>de Monte|leon</HI> and <HI>de Hijar</HI> her two Daughters, only waited till the Queen was up, to go and take her leave of her. Her Vi&s;age was more pale than ordinary, and her Eyes more red and fiery: She then ap|proached the Queen, and without weeping, or &s;hewing the lea&s;t Concern, told her, She was ve|ry &s;orry that &s;he had not &s;erved her &s;o well as &s;he wi&s;hed. The Queen, who was a Per&s;on of wonderful Tenderne&s;s, could not forbear to
<PB N="84" REF="86">
&s;eem &s;omewhat touched, and to relent a little; but as &s;he was &s;aying &s;ome obliging things to comfort her, the Dutche&s;s interrupted her, and told her with an imperious Air, <Q REND="inline">That a Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> ought not to weep for &s;o incon&s;idera|ble a matter; That the <HI>Camarera</HI> who came to &s;ucceed her in her Place, would acquit her &s;elf better of her Duty:</Q> And &s;o, without &s;aying a Word more, &s;he took hold of the Queen's Hand, and making a &s;hew of ki&s;&s;ing it, immediately re|tired. When every one about the Court knew that &s;he was to go away, they came to her Apart|ment, &s;hedding Tears, either through Policy, In|clination, or Weakne&s;s. She did not &s;eem to them to be in the lea&s;t afflicted, and ca&s;ting her Eyes on all &s;ides, &s;he &s;aid: <HI>I thank Heaven, this is a Place where I &s;hall never &s;et my Foot again; I am going to ta&s;te the Sweets of Repo&s;e, and to find Tranquility at my own Hou&s;e: I will go to</HI> Sicily<HI>, there I &s;hall meet with no &s;uch Di&s;gu&s;ts as I have found at</HI> Madrid. In &s;aying the&s;e Words, &s;he &s;truck her Fi&s;t twice upon a little Table that &s;tood near her, and taking a very pretty <HI>China</HI> Fan, &s;he broke it in two, threw it upon the ground, and &s;tampt it under her Feet.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he was &s;ent away a few days after the Father Confe&s;&s;or; &s;he that never thought of leaving the Court, as well by rea&s;on of the A&s;|cendant &s;he had got over the King, as becau&s;e it was a thing without a Pre&s;ident, till now, to re|move the Queen's <HI>Camarera Major,</HI> unle&s;s it &s;o happen'd, that &s;he de&s;ired it her &s;elf. 'Tis ea&s;y to imagine the Grief &s;he felt upon this occa&s;ion; however, to comfort her in &s;ome mea&s;ure, it was re&s;olved to be&s;tow the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Gallicia</HI> up|on the Duke <HI>de Hijar,</HI> her Son-in-Law, and the Order of the Fleece upon the Duke <HI>de Monteleon,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="87">
who had married her Grand-Daughter. They were likewi&s;e willing &s;till to continue to her the Honours and the Appointments belonging to her Place; but as &s;oon as &s;he was informed of the good intentions of the Court towards her, &s;he proudly &s;aid, That &s;he would refu&s;e every thing they could offer her, and that <HI>this was to give her Incen&s;e, for&s;ooth, and break her No&s;e with the Cen&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was departed from the Palace, the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> went thither to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Apartment; and though &s;he had the Character of a Proud Haughty Woman, yet &s;he did not make it appear, that &s;he intended to Copy after the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI>'s Conduct: On the other hand, &s;he entertained all People with a World of Re&s;pect and Civility, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t Affection imaginable for the Young Queen. This Lady was Widow to the Duke <HI>de Albuquerque,</HI> who was Chief of the Fa|mily <HI>de la Cueva,</HI> and was Fifty Years old. I always &s;aw her wear a little Bandore of Black Taffata, which reached down as low as her Eye-Brows, and bound her Forehead &s;o hard, that her Eyes were &s;welled with it. She was a Woman of great Wit and Reading, and on certain days in the Week, held A&s;&s;emblies at her Hou&s;e, where all the Learned were well received. She had on|ly one Daughter, whom &s;he married to the Younge&s;t Brother of the late Duke <HI>de Albuquerque,</HI> to keep up the Name of the Family. She was pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the Queen-Mother's Par|ty, and People did not doubt, but that &s;he would u&s;e the Young Queen very well. They were af|terwards confirmed in this Opinion, when they heard the King, a little after her admittance to Court, tell the Queen, That he would have her
<PB N="86" REF="88">
take her Plea&s;ure more than &s;he had hitherto done; That &s;he mu&s;t walk abroad, and ride on Hor&s;e|back; and that he was willing &s;he might go to Bed late, provided he might go to Bed at Eight a Clock, as his Cu&s;tom was. Nay, he was &s;o ve|ry complai&s;ant a few days after, as to re&s;olve not to go to Bed till Ten. This agreeable Alteration in his Conduct, gave the World occa&s;ion to con|jecture, that the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> had en|gaged the Queen-Mother to &s;peak to the King in favour of her; and that the Severity which the Queen had hitherto undergone, had been in&s;pi|red into the King only by the means of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova.</HI></P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Caralvo,</HI> who was of the Coun|cil of State, died about this time: He left prodi|gious Sums of ready Money behind him; and the Crown gained by his Death &s;ixty &s;even thou&s;and Crowns; which was yearly given him by way of Pen&s;ion. The Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>'s Lady died likewi&s;e, and as he had lived after a very indif|ferent manner with her always, and was one of the greate&s;t Admirers of the fair Sex in all the World; &s;o he did not over-much complain for his Wife's Death, nor was over-&s;orrowful to be|come a Widower. He had accu&s;tomed her to &s;ee near fifteen or &s;ixteen of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es live, in his Hou&s;e with him, in very fine Apartments, and all different; and he was &s;ometimes &s;o mali|cious, when &s;he walked out in the Garden, as to look out of a Window with one of the&s;e Creatures &s;tanding by him, who let her Handkerchief, or a Ribbon drop, and the Admiral would call to his Wife to take it up, and bring it to the Per&s;on to whom it belonged; which &s;he &s;ubmitted to do, with a Re&s;pect and Patience that all the World admired.</P>

It happened to be &s;aid at Court, That a cer|tain Man was found digging in the Ground very early in the Morning, over again&s;t the <HI>Imperial Colledge.</HI> His De&s;ign was to take up &s;ome Money and Jewels, which a <HI>Jew,</HI> who had been burnt, and who&s;e Dome&s;tick he was, had buried in that place. The King ordered him to bring what he had found there: It was all locked up in a little Iron Che&s;t, which was full of Pieces of Gold of &s;everal &s;orts; and among&s;t the re&s;t, there were Two Pictures which I have &s;een, bigger than my Hand, and in circled round with Diamonds of a con&s;iderable Value: about them were Two little Scrowls of Parchment, with &s;ome Writing upon them; upon one, <HI>The Dutche&s;s de Chievreu&s;e</HI>; and on the other, <HI>The Dutche&s;s de Montbazon.</HI> It was judged, that the <HI>Jews</HI> who traffick much, and lend Money upon Pawns, came perhaps by the&s;e Pictures after the &s;ame manner. They were per|fectly fini&s;hed, and the Ladies were both of ad|mirable Beauty. The King &s;aid, that they ought to be &s;ent to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI></P>
<P>I often had the happine&s;s to &s;ee the Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> who was one of the mo&s;t beautiful and agreeable Per&s;ons at Court; her Husband was a Man of infinite Wit: He was much again&s;t his Will Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Rome</HI>; and when he was to go thither, endeavoured all the ways in the World to break off his Voyage. He tarried a long time upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was unwil|ling to depart, pretending that he was ill, and praying them to &s;end another in his room, to whom he offered to give all his Equipage, as a free Gift, or el&s;e to tru&s;t him for it, at his choice: But the Court was afraid of the Vivacity of his Genius, and he was known to be a Man of En|terpri&s;e:

For this Rea&s;on it was thought conve|nient to keep him at a di&s;tance, and &s;o they &s;ent him fre&s;h Orders to depart, and go to <HI>Rome.</HI> He appeared there with a great Magnificence, and &s;upported the Honour of his Mini&s;try very well. When the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> was made Chief Mini&s;ter, he writ &s;everal Letters to him, and em|ploy'd the Intere&s;t of all his Family to get him|&s;elf recalled. It was po&s;itively denied him, be|cau&s;e he was feared now more than ever; And it was apprehended, in ca&s;e he returned home, that he would unite him&s;elf with his Brother the Count <HI>de Monterei.</HI> To the&s;e Rea&s;ons of State the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> joyned &s;ome private ones, that purely re&s;pected his own proper Intere&s;t: for it was an ea&s;y matter to take Advantage of the Ab&s;ence of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> to have a certain Law Suit determined, which was de|pending between them.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s being informed of what had happened, and de&s;pairing ever to &s;urmount tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles which the Duke laid in his way, thought the &s;ure&s;t Expedient to get him&s;elf recalled home, would be to di&s;gu&s;t the Pope upon all occa&s;ions; And herein he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o dexterou&s;ly, and did every thing to di&s;plea&s;e the Pope after &s;o di&s;obliging a manner, that his Holine&s;s &s;ent the King Word, That unle&s;s he would recall the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> he mu&s;t re&s;olve to leave <HI>Rome</HI>; intreating him to &s;end another Amba&s;&s;ador in his Place, &s;ince he had never &s;een &s;o di&s;agreeable a one as this in all his Life: But they an&s;wered him, That one of the Rea&s;ons which inclined them to continue him &s;till at <HI>Rome,</HI> was, becau&s;e his Holine&s;s had declared, That he would grant the Rights of the Franchi&s;es, and the Immunities

<P>The Pope perceiving that he tormented him|&s;elf in vain; and that if he, for his part, had good Rea&s;ons to demand the recalling of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> had al&s;o theirs to deny it, did not renew his Importuni|ties any more: but being re&s;olved to do all the ill offices he could to the Amba&s;&s;ador, who had on purpo&s;e di&s;obliged him, as far as lay in his power, he found an opportunity to quit Scores with him; and he took his advantage of it with plea&s;ure. It was about a Di&s;pen&s;ation, which the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> demanded of him in favour of <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon,</HI> his Uncle, to marry <HI>Donna Catalina de la Cerda,</HI> Daughter to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI></P>
<P>This young Lady was Niece to <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon,</HI> who was Brother to the Duke <HI>de Car|donne,</HI> and to the Cardinal of <HI>Arragon</HI>; and the Duke <HI>de Cardonne</HI> was Father to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medina Celi:</HI> &s;o that there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity for a Di&s;pen&s;ation.

The Amba&s;&s;ador omitted nothing to compa&s;s it, and gave him&s;elf a great deal of Trouble and Pains to no purpo&s;e; they &s;till put

In fine, after having made him dance Attendance long enough, till he had lo&s;t all manner of Patience, they blunt|ly told him, that they could by no means grant what he demanded, and that the Pope made a Scruple of giving a Di&s;pen&s;ation to a Man, who was Seventy Years old, to marry his Niece, who was not yet Sixteen. The Amba&s;&s;ador &s;en&s;ibly re&s;ented this Refu&s;al, and &s;ent &s;peedy notice of it to <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon:</HI> but what gave him a new occa&s;ion to be more di&s;plea&s;ed, was to hear, That at the very moment when <HI>Don Pedro</HI> was reading his Letter at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the <HI>Nuncio</HI> brought him a Di&s;pen&s;ation that was expedited <HI>gratis,</HI> and told him, That he had received it much &s;ooner, if the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> had not appeared in the matter. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> &s;ent his Nephew word of all the&s;e Circum&s;tance: who was exceedingly vex|ed at it.

It was not at all que&s;tioned, but that the Queen-Mother advanced the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Albuquerque</HI> to the Place where now &s;he was to be &s;een; and People were as fully per&s;uaded, that it was &s;he who got the Prince <HI>de Parma</HI> to be &s;ent into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> to recompence the great Zeal he had al|ways expre&s;&s;ed in her Service. But the Council of State began to be Alarmed at the great Pow|er of this Prince&s;s. <HI>What is the matter?</HI> would they u&s;ually &s;ay one to another, <HI>Are we going to have a new Regency, and is the King re&s;olved to be under Ward&s;hip again?</HI> What gave them the grea|te&s;t occa&s;ion to talk after this manner, was as follows: The Council having, according to the Cu&s;tom, named Three Subjects for the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Peru,</HI> out of which number the King generally chu&s;es one; his Maje&s;ty, without having any regard to it, named <HI>Don Melchior Na|varra,</HI> who had advanced his Fortune by the means of the Queen-Mother, and was ab&s;olutely devoted to her.

<P>The Queen-Mother being de&s;irous to make him compleatly happy, got the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Peru</HI> for him, which is a very Advantageous Po&s;t; for in le&s;s than five Years time a Man may very well heap up Three Millions by it, without wronging either his own Con&s;cience, or his Neighbour.

<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of the E&s;tates of the Uni|nited Provinces, had Audience of the King, on the Twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> He demanded of him the Payment of &s;everal Millions that were due from the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Admiralty of <HI>Holland,</HI> ever &s;ince the Year 1675.

<P>People talked very &s;trangely at <HI>Madrid,</HI> of
<PB N="95" REF="97">
the King's recalling the Duke <HI>de Veraguas,</HI> who was Vice-Roy of <HI>Valentia.</HI> This little Kingdom is, as it were, annexed to that of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and is a place where there never fail to be abundance of Murderers, Robbers and Cut-Throats. The malignant influence that reigns here, makes the Men naturally &s;o bad, that when there is any ill Action to be done, they make u&s;e of the <HI>Bandolero's,</HI> who are a &s;ort of <HI>Banditti,</HI> divided into &s;everal Factions, and have each of them their Chief, who are ge|nerally &s;editious Per&s;ons, capable of all the Vil|lanies in the World. An Apo&s;tatized Monk took &s;helter among&s;t them, and they found him to be &s;o re&s;olute and hardened a Fellow, that they cho&s;e him for their Captain; but as it happened, the very moment he came to com|mit an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, he was taken with his Sword in his Hand. He could not deny &s;o palpable a Crime, and the Vice-Roy was advi&s;ed to exe|cute &s;peedy Ju&s;tice upon him. The Vice-Roy was well enough &s;atisfied that he ought to &s;erve him &s;o; but what gave him &s;ome trouble, was this, That having to deal with a Religious, he thought that he ought to u&s;e more Formality with him. Another Rea&s;on likewi&s;e &s;topt him a little; for by the laws of <HI>Valentia,</HI> &s;ome days are allotted to Criminals after they are condemn|ed, before their Execution. He ordered Four Religious of different orders to meet, and con|&s;ulted them upon the&s;e Two Heads: Two of them were of opinion, that he might take Cognizance of this matter with the Archbi|&s;hop's Con&s;ent: The Two others maintained, That although the Laws of the Countrey al|low &s;ome time to a Guilty Per&s;on, and that this
<PB N="96" REF="98">
was a Monk belonging to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ju|ri&s;diction; yet for all that, the King's Ser|vice demanded a &s;peedy and &s;evere Example; and that the Actions of this Man were &s;o abo|minably odious, that he de&s;erved to have no Re&s;pect &s;hown him. The Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> was of their Opinion, and ordered him to be hanged immediately. The Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks demand|ed him before Execution; the Archbi&s;hop &s;up|ported them by his Authority, and when he knew it was to no purpo&s;e, his Official publi&s;hed an Interdict. The People immediately made an In&s;urrection, and the Vice-Roy was obliged to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his Palace; but being be&s;ieged on every &s;ide, and apprehending &s;ome danger from the Violence of the Rabble, he e&s;caped out of the City well Accompanied. The Archbi&s;hop lo&s;t no time to inform the Court of what had happened; the Duke too &s;ent thither as &s;oon, and each of them alledged their Rea&s;ons. Upon this the King ordered a <HI>Juncto</HI> to &s;it, compo&s;ed of his own Confe&s;&s;or, a Je&s;uit, and a Dominican. It happened well for the Archbi&s;hop that he was of the &s;ame Order with this la&s;t, and had been Ge|neral of his Order; He wanted no more to gain the Cau&s;e; the Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> was condemn|ed with one Con&s;ent, and a Sum of Money was re|mitted to him, with Orders to come within Twen|ty Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and there to wait the King's farther Plea&s;ure. On the Twenty Sixth of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> the Count <HI>de Aquilar</HI> was named to &s;ucceed him in his Place, and within 24 Hours after he departed, to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>If this affair, the Judgment whereof ap|peared too rigorous, made &s;o great a Noi&s;e, the Connivance &s;hown to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Las</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="99">
<HI>Navas,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Sicily,</HI> &s;urprized People no le&s;s. He meerly, for a Humour, per&s;ecuted the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Palermo,</HI> &s;o as to make him leave the City: The King being informed of the Pro|ceedings, was not only content to Reprimand the Vice-Roy for it, but ordered, That the Arch|bi&s;hop &s;hould receive particular Satisfaction from him. He wrote a very obliging Letter to this Prelate, wherein he acquainted him how much he was concerned at the Affronts he had received, and &s;ent it to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Navas,</HI> with Or|ders to deliver it to the Archbi&s;hop with his own Hands. The Vice-Roy received it, and kept it by him; but they being informed of it at Court, a fre&s;h Injunction was &s;ent him: He obey'd this no better than the former. This Stiffne&s;s and Con|tumacy of his, perfectly wearied the Council, without drawing the lea&s;t inconvenience up|on him; &s;o that they no more commanded him to deliver the Letter to the Archbi&s;hop. It is very certain, that another Man would not have had this Indulgence &s;how'n him; but the Vice-Roy being, it &s;eems, obliged to marry his Son to one of the Daughters of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> this is one Rea&s;on why he was &s;ure to meet with good Quarter, as long as the Duke continu|ed in Favour. Neverthele&s;s, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Louvignies,</HI> who was made Governour of <HI>Me&s;&s;i|na,</HI> was no &s;ooner arrived there, but he was of|fended to &s;ee the Fortifications and Garri&s;on in &s;o ill a Condition. He plainly told the Marque&s;s <HI>de Las Navas,</HI> That he could not di&s;pen&s;e with him&s;elf from giving the Court an Account of the&s;e matters. He was as good as his Word, and the Vice-Roy received a &s;evere Check for his Negligence.</P>
<P>They had a new occa&s;ion to be di&s;plea&s;ed at <HI>Madrid,</HI> when they received Advices of what
<PB N="98" REF="100">
happened at <HI>Naples,</HI> on the 7<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September:</HI> The Vice-Roy pa&s;&s;ing through the <HI>Toledo-Street,</HI> to go to Vi&s;it the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nuns, was &s;topt by an Hundred Troopers, all armed, and on Hor&s;e-back, who Audaciou&s;ly demanded of him, either to pay them off, or el&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>So re&s;olute an Action as this was, did not a little &s;urprize him: He promi&s;ed to do every thing they de&s;ired of him, and returned back a|gain to the Palace very &s;uddenly. As &s;oon as he believed him&s;elf to be &s;afe, he ordered Six Soldi|ers to be &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and their Tryals to come on &s;peedily. He reformed all the Cavalry, to|gether with the Captains, and the other Officers, as well as the Lieutenant General. This Body of Hor&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of Seven Troops, and had been kept up above Fifty Years. He pretended, That he had received Orders from <HI>Madrid</HI> to reform them after this manner; but the real Truth is, he was not in a condition to pay them. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> hereupon was exceedingly grieved, to be|hold the Mi&s;ery to which all his Kingdoms were reduced.</P>
<P>But all this evil News was ballanced, when they knew that the Plague was intirely ceas'd in <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> and that the Chief Magi&s;trate of <HI>Cales</HI> finding the Port of St <HI>Mary</HI> free from the In|fection, had taken off the Prohibition of Com|merce. After this, they immediately begun to load the Gallions. On the Fifth of <HI>September</HI> there were great rejoicings at Court, becau&s;e it was the Birth-day of his Mo&s;t Catholick Maje&s;ty: A Comedy was Acted there, and all the Am|ba&s;&s;adors and Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> were pre&s;ent at it. The Queen appeared &s;o covered with Jewels, that her Diamonds ca&s;t a greater Light than &s;ix large Flambeaux, as big as Torches did, that were lighted in the Great Hall. A few days after
<PB N="99" REF="101">
this, the King and the two Queens went &s;olemn|ly to Chappel, where the Anniver&s;ary of <HI>Philip</HI> IV. was celebrated with great Ceremonies. The Queen being returned to the Palace, found a Sealed Letter in her Pocket, having the &s;ame Su|per&s;cription with that which &s;he formerly re|ceived; and &s;eeing written on the out-&s;ide, <HI>For the Queen alone,</HI> &s;he would not open it, and al|mo&s;t di&s;tracted her &s;elf in thinking what Per&s;on it was, that could find the means to come &s;o nigh her, as to &s;lip this Letter into her Pocket. Towards Evening &s;he went along with the King to the Queen-Mother's Palace, to make her the u&s;ual Compliments of Condolance, upon the Death of the late King her Husband. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> told the King, That &s;he had re|ceived a Letter from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which had great Curio&s;ities in it. The King replied, That he was de&s;irous to hear it.</P>
<P>All the Company being gone out of the Room, &s;he placed her &s;elf near him to read it. The Queen took her advantage of this Opportunity, and told the Queen-Mother, That &s;he had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee a Picture of <HI>Titian,</HI> which &s;he had lately bought. As &s;he &s;aid the&s;e Words, &s;he ad|vanced towards the great Clo&s;et of the Queen-Mother, whither &s;he follow'd her. When they had entred into it, the Young Queen gave her the Letter, which &s;he had found in her Pocket, and de&s;ired her to keep it, or burn it, as &s;he thought mo&s;t convenient. <HI>I don't know,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>but it may come from the Dutche&s;s</HI> de Terra Nova; <HI>but &s;he &s;hall be clearly mi&s;taken in her Project.</HI> The Queen-Mother told her, That &s;he had be&s;t open the Letter to &s;ee what was contained in it. <HI>Ah, Madam,</HI> replied the Queen, <HI>I would never, by my good Will, &s;ee any &s;uch Letters.</HI> The Queen-Mo|ther admired the prudent Conduct of this Young
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Prince&s;s, and bid her not di&s;quiet her &s;elf about the matter; for &s;he would take care to keep it &s;ealed by her: And &s;ome time after, &s;he recounted this Adventure to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Mortare,</HI> and &s;how'd her the fir&s;t Letter, &s;aying, &s;he be|lieved it proceeded from the Malice of &s;ome Per|&s;ons who de&s;igned to do the Queen a Mi&s;chief. It was through this Lady's means, that my Cou&s;in and I came to know all that I have written con|cerning this Affair.</P>
<P>The Queen, and the Queen-Mother did not tarry long together, but came to find the King, who told them, That the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medina Ce|li</HI> had read a Letter to him, wherein was contain|ed a very Tragical &s;urpri&s;ing Accident, and that they would by no means think their time lo&s;t to hear it. The Dutche&s;s immediately read the Letter; it was dated from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the 18<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> 1680, and gave an Account, how, That on the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> in the &s;ame Year, the City of <HI>Ma&s;ulipatan,</HI> which is the greate&s;t Scale of Trade in the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> had been overflow'd by the Sea, and by extraordinary Rains, accompanied with a furious Hurricane: That above Twenty five thou&s;and Per&s;ons were drowned there, and that the lo&s;s of the Goods and Merchandize amounted to Twenty Millions: That it had Rained Blood for the &s;pace of Two Hours, in the Village of <HI>Sohou,</HI> near <HI>Deli,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> keeps his Re&s;idence; and that part of the City of <HI>Sougean,</HI> near <HI>Daera,</HI> had been over-whelmed by an Earthquake: That the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> having received Advice, That the <HI>Raja Seva|gi,</HI> after he had pillaged the City of <HI>Danga,</HI> threat|ned to be&s;iege <HI>Bombay,</HI> (which is a Place that was yeilded up by the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> to them, together with <HI>Tangier,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of the Marriage of the <HI>Infanta Catharina,</HI> Queen of <HI>England</HI>) had

The Prince <HI>Cercan Loudi,</HI> who was with her, was driven into De&s;pair, when he &s;aw his Mi&s;tre&s;s taken away from him; he threw him|&s;elf, with his Forces, upon tho&s;e of <HI>Sevagi,</HI> and after a long Combat <HI>Cercan</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner; and the Prince remained Ma&s;ter of the Field. After this, he &s;till carried <HI>Famika</HI> along with him; and &s;he appeared &s;o charming to him, that he told her, If &s;he was willing to marry him, he would re&s;tore to <HI>Cercan Loudi</HI> all that he had taken from him by way of Conque&s;t. The Prince&s;s haughtily replied, That &s;he would never &s;acrifice
<PB N="102" REF="104">
her &s;elf to one that was a Subject to the King her Brother. <HI>Sevagi,</HI> who was deeply in Love with her, di&s;patched an Envoy to the King of <HI>Vi&s;ia|pour,</HI> to demand <HI>Famika</HI> of him, and promi&s;ed, That if he would be&s;tow that Prince&s;s upon him, he would &s;erve him as his Va&s;&s;al. The King &s;corned the Propo&s;al, treating him as a Revolted Subject, whom he knew well enough how to cha&s;ti&s;e. When the other &s;aw that gentle Me|thods &s;ignified nothing, he pre&s;ently fell a Rava|ging the Country of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> except &s;ix or &s;even Places upon the Coa&s;ts; &s;o that his Conque&s;ts extended as far as <HI>Negapa|tan</HI>; and this, in all, made near 250 Leagues in length. He always carried his Fair Pri&s;oner along with him, hoping to gain her by his Re|&s;pect and Complai&s;ance; but having had one day a very long Conver&s;ation with her upon this Topick, wherein &s;he declared, That all the Inju|ries either &s;he, or tho&s;e of her Family, &s;uffered at his Hands, only &s;erved to provoke her the more, and that &s;he would never love any one but <HI>Cercan Loudi</HI>; the Love of <HI>Sevagi</HI> was in a moment turned into Fury, and he had the Cruelty to cau&s;e a Scaffold to be erected for her, where with his own Hands he cut off the Head of the young Prince&s;s <HI>Famika,</HI> and her Lover.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother having a great kindne&s;s for the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> received two of her Daughters, who were very lovely and well &s;haped, into the number of her Ladies.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, the King, the two Queens, and all the Court, departed for <HI>Aranjuez</HI>; but the Hou&s;e not being large enough to lodge half the Officers and Ladies, they came back every Night, and lay near it. The Duke <HI>de Uzeda,</HI> the Count <HI>de Altamire,</HI> and the two Sons of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves like Mule|teers,

with Bonnets, after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, pulled over their Heads to hide them; and be|ing dre&s;s'd after Fa&s;hion, they went every day on Foot by the Boot of the Coach of the Queen's Maids of Honour, to Court their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, as the Cu&s;tom is there.</P>
<P>Although the King had Prohibited all Per&s;ons in General, and Married People in Particular, <HI>Los Galanteos de Palacio,</HI> as they call it, at <HI>Madrid</HI>; yet he was not able to hinder it. It has been a thing e&s;tabli&s;hed time out of mind among&s;t them, to entertain the Ladies of the Court, with their Gallantry, although they have not the lea&s;t de&s;ign to marry them: And they wait upon them with as much A&s;&s;iduity, as if they were al|ready betrothed to them. But what is the &s;trang|e&s;t, as well as the lea&s;t pardonable thing of all, is, that they ruine them&s;elves by it: I have feen married Men, nay, even tho&s;e that were Grand|fathers, totally taken up in an Amour with one of the Ladies of the Court. The Women, who&s;e Husbands are led away with the&s;e Extra|vagant Fancies, are extremely di&s;gu&s;ted at it; and this often occa&s;ions horrid Di&s;orders in their Fa|milies; but all that the&s;e Cavaliers pretend to reap by their Pa&s;&s;ion, is only, that their Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es will &s;uffer them to come and &s;top under their Windows. Here they &s;it in the back part of their Coaches, and entertain them by their Fingers, and the Ladies an&s;wer them after the &s;ame manner, without &s;peaking to them, but only upon days of Ceremony; for at that time, they have the liberty to Acco&s;t them before all the World. But what is very &s;urpri&s;ing, and was never yet practi|&s;ed any where el&s;e, the Ladies of Honour be|longing to the Queen, receive Jewels, Apparel, and con&s;iderable Sums of Money from their Gal|lants. The Dukes <HI>de Montalte</HI>; and <HI>de Medina</HI>

<P>The Diver&s;ion there is but little, becau&s;e the greate&s;t plea&s;ure one can take, is to walk along the &s;ides of the River <HI>Tagus,</HI> which wa&s;h the Banks of the fine&s;t Walks in the World; but the Rains were &s;o great, that no body could &s;tir out When there was the lea&s;t fair Weather, the Queen rode on Hor&s;e-back with all her Ladies, but one of them had the mi&s;chance to be carried away by her Hor&s;e, and received &s;o much hurt by her Fall, that &s;he died within three days after. This ill Accident troubled the King exceedingly, &s;o that by his good Will, he would not &s;uffer the Queen to ride: When he &s;aw her not, he would &s;till be crying. <HI>Let &s;ome body go to &s;ee how my Queen does, and bring me word, whether &s;he is fallen off her Hor&s;e.</HI> The King was informed at <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> that two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Men of War, in their return to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> had met a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, commanded by the Chevalier <HI>de Leti:</HI> He demanded the Sa|lute of them; and upon their refu&s;ing to do it gave them a Broad-&s;ide, which they an&s;wered with all their Guns; but after a long di&s;pute, he obliged them to &s;trike the Flag. After this, the Ve&s;&s;el continued its cour&s;e towards <HI>Villa Franca</HI> where the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Savoy</HI> waited to be carried over to <HI>Portugal.</HI> Upon this the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Spain</HI> told the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> that there was no que&s;tion to be made, but his Gallies woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;erved after the &s;ame manner, if they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> not better provided.</P>

along with him thither, till he had &s;taid &s;ome time at &s;ome of the other Hou&s;es belonging to the Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> He had been told, That it was looked upon to be an ill Omen, to go fir&s;t to the place where the Royal Tombs are; and &s;ince the Queen had as yet been only at <HI>Buen Retiro, &agrave; la Ca&s;a del Campo,</HI> at <HI>Pardo,</HI> and <HI>Zarzuela,</HI> which are &s;o near <HI>Madrid,</HI> that &s;he ju&s;t re&s;ted her &s;elf there a few hours, after &s;he came from hunting. He was re&s;olved to begin with <HI>Aran|juez,</HI> to avert and fru&s;trate tho&s;e evil Pre&s;ages: Therefore he ordered every thing to be in readi|ne&s;s for his Journey, by the beginning of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> which is one of the fine&s;t Months of the Year in <HI>Spain:</HI> But the Mini&s;ters not finding Mo|ney enough in the Trea&s;ury to defray the Expen|ces of the Progre&s;s, dexterou&s;ly endeavoured to put it by; though in all appearance they &s;eemed to de&s;ire it as much as the King did, and daily ordered Mules to be got ready to carry the Bag|gage. They pretended the Ways were dangerous and bad, and at la&s;t, that the great Rains had corrupted the Air. Nay, they &s;ent for &s;ome Phy&s;icians, with whom they had been practi&s;ing, to confirm all they &s;aid. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the King &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Re&s;oluti|on to go to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> and did not know till the very Evening before he was to depart, that he could not go. He was the only Per&s;on that was ignorant of it; for the Mini&s;ters had acquainted their Friends with it above Twelve Days before, and all the City was informed, that the King was to &s;tay at <HI>Madrid</HI> &s;till. The Queen was not a little di&s;plea&s;ed at the&s;e Proceedings; &s;he &s;poke to the King about it, and told him, that the Mi|ni&s;ters might now very well forbear to u&s;e them any longer like Children; that if there had been any important Rea&s;ons why they &s;hould not go
<PB N="106" REF="108">
to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> they ought to have given them timely notice of it; but to put them off, and, &s;peaking properly, to fool them after this in&s;uf|ferable rate, was never to be endured. The King was vexed, and told the Queen, That this &s;hould be the la&s;t time he would &s;uffer &s;uch things at their Hands, and that they &s;hould direct them|&s;elves for the future, only by his Will and Plea|&s;ure. This Di&s;cour&s;e was over-heard by &s;ome of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, who went pre&s;ently to acquaint the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> with it, to make their Court by this means. He was terribly di&s;heartned, and feared le&s;t the Queen, who was charming and witty, might come to get a greater A&s;cendent over the King's Inclinations than he de&s;ired; and therefore that he might not di&s;plea&s;e the King any more, u&s;ed all imaginable diligence to provide a Fund &s;uffi|cient to bear the Expences of going to <HI>Aranjuez</HI> and the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> Till this very moment, he had re&s;olved to break off the&s;e Two Journeys; but he apprehended a great deal of danger from the Queen's di&s;&s;atisfaction; and &s;o to get a Sum ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the occa&s;ion, he &s;old Two Offices of the <HI>Contador Major</HI> for Twenty five thou&s;and Crowns, and received Forty more for a Govern|ment in the <HI>Indies.</HI> He took Fifty thou&s;and Crowns out of an Hundred thou&s;and, that were to be laid out in Equipping of the Gallions. He made u&s;e of the Money gathered for Cu&s;tom, that was to have paid off the Rights of the Fran|chi&s;es, and the Revenues of the Town-Hall: In a word, every thing was got ready by that time the Court came back from <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> for them to go to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> However, the King was not able to go as &s;oon as he de&s;ired, by rea&s;on that the ill Weather increa&s;ed; ever &s;ince the be+ginning of <HI>September</HI> never a day pa&s;&s;ed withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

violent Tempe&s;ts, accompanied by dreadful Claps of Thunder: The Lightning &s;truck abundance of Per&s;ons in &s;everal Places, and the Hail fell &s;o thick, and in &s;uch prodigious quantities in the Fore&s;t of the <HI>Pardo,</HI> which is an Hou&s;e of plea|&s;ure belonging to the King, that it broke the Branches of the greate&s;t Trees, and killed &s;o many Birds and Wild-Fowl, that both the Fields and the River of <HI>Mancanarez</HI> were covered with them, and it was the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ight in the World to behold: The Ancient Bridge <HI>de Aranda de Duero</HI> was carried away by the Waters of that River, and the <HI>Tagus</HI> over flowed its Banks with that Impetuo&s;ity, that it did an incredible Mi&s;|chief to the plea&s;ant Walks at <HI>Aranjuez.</HI> So many Accidents, of which they received fre&s;h News daily, troubled the Court exceedingly; for there was &s;carce a place in <HI>Spain</HI> exempt from the&s;e continual Tempe&s;ts: One of them hap|pened on the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> in &s;o outragi|ous a manner, that the Gardens of the Counte&s;s <HI>de Ognate,</HI> which are the fine&s;t in <HI>Madrid,</HI> were over-flown in a moment; the Water entred into the lower Apartments of her Hou&s;e, where &s;he kept her noble&s;t <HI>Italian</HI> Paintings, and her riche&s;t Moveables, and all was intirely &s;poiled by this Inundation. The Torrent, to work out its pa&s;|&s;age, threw down the Garden-Walls, and broke into that belonging to our Lady's <HI>de Atocha.</HI> The next Night we all thought, that <HI>Madrid</HI> would be beaten down about our Ears by the Thunder|claps, the Lightning, the Wind, the Rain, and the Hail. I don't believe any body went to Bed in the whole City; the Churches were full of People who confe&s;&s;ed, as if the hour of Death were approaching. The Water of the <HI>Manca|narez</HI> &s;welled exceedingly, and &s;pread it &s;elf on all &s;ides. The King and the Queen, who impa|tiently
<PB N="108" REF="110">
waited for day-light, went in Devotion to our Lady's <HI>de Atocha,</HI> but at their return they found the <HI>Pardo</HI> over-flown; and though a Coach had been over-turned a little before, by the: apidity of the Torrent, the King believed that his might pa&s;s it well enough, and com|manded the Coachman to advance &s;peedily for|ward towards the Bridge of the bare-legged <HI>Au|gu&s;tines:</HI> Within a few Paces of the Bridge, the two fore Mules, which in <HI>Spain</HI> are at a pretty di&s;tance from the hindmo&s;t, were overturned by the Impetuo&s;ity of the Water: The Po&s;tillion that led them '&s;caped very narrowly; the Mules recovered them&s;elves twice, and were thrown down as often. The King was all alone in the Coach with the Queen, very much concerned, and telling her, that he was in pain only for her &s;ake. In the mean time, &s;ome People got hold by the Traces, and &s;o drew out the Coach by meet &s;trength. By this means the Mules got out of the Water; but their Maje&s;ties could not reach the Palace, and being affrighted at the great Danger they had ju&s;t e&s;caped, were obliged to go to <HI>Buen-Retiro,</HI> where they tarried till mid-night, and waited for the Waters to fall.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de los Velez,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> di&s;patched a Courier to Court, to give them Advice, That the Pope had demanded of them, to &s;end the Marque&s;s <HI>Sera,</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> to him, who was Excommunicated for falling foul upon the Apo&s;tolick <HI>Nuncio</HI>'s Courier on <HI>Maun|dy Thur&s;day.</HI> The Brief &s;pecified, <HI>That his Ho|line&s;s grounded his Preten&s;ions upon the Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Soveraignty the Holy See had to the Kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Naples.

Affair. But the King and the Mini&s;ters here, could not forbear to wonder, that his Holine&s;s &s;poke of renewing his Preten&s;ions, which &s;eem|ed to be adju&s;ted a long time ago.</P>
<P>The only Son of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Ca&s;tel-Rodri|go</HI> died about the beginning of <HI>October</HI>; as did al&s;o <HI>Don Rui Gomez, de Silva,</HI> Brother to the Duke <HI>de Hijar.</HI> We may &s;ay, they were two of the mo&s;t hand&s;ome and hopeful Lords at Court. This la&s;t was mightily devoted to <HI>Don|na I&s;abella de Mendoza,</HI> a Lady of great Beauty, who was not completely Seventeen Years old. She took the Death of her Lover &s;o much to heart, that without acquainting her Mother with it, &s;he got out of her Hou&s;e, covered in a Mantle, and went to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Mona&s;tery founded by <HI>Joan|na,</HI> Si&s;ter to <HI>Phi|lip</HI> IV.</NOTE><HI>De&s;cal&s;as Reales,</HI> there to take upon her the Religious Habit.</P>
<P>Their Maje&s;ties parted from <HI>Madrid</HI> on the 7<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> to go to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> The King only carried with him the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold, with two Ma&s;ters of the Hou&s;e in Ordinary, the Great Fore&s;ter, and the Fir&s;t Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and two other Lords in the &s;ame Of|fice, <HI>Don Geronimo de Eguya,</HI> Secretary of State, and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor. The Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, did not arrive there till Fourteen Days after the King: He was naturally &s;o lazy, even when he was obliged to make his Court, that he could not re&s;olve in a le&s;s time to go to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI></P>
<P>All the Ladies of the Court, and Six Women of the Bed-Chamber, Accompanied the Queen; the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villa Maina,</HI> Chief Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the Marque&s;s <HI>de A&s;tor|gas,</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="112">
Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold, went along with her. As for the Duke <HI>de O&s;&s;one,</HI> who was Ma|&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to her, he tarried at <HI>Madrid</HI> upon the account of a new Di&s;gu&s;t, he had received at Court. The King was willing that the Queen &s;hould ride on Hor&s;e-back, to take a few turns in the Walks of the Meadows, and to meet him as he came from hunting. She had Four Fits of an Ague, but the following ones were &s;o gentle that &s;he was able to get up a few days after, and divert her &s;elf as &s;he had u&s;ed to do ever &s;ince her Arrival to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who was altogether taken up with the Plea&s;ures of hunting, pur&s;ued the Sport from Sun ri&s;ing till Night. One day he ordered a Chace to be prepared after the <HI>German</HI> manner; they had Toils which inclo&s;ed a great quantity of Ground, and here with their Guns they killed above Two hundred Bucks and Does. The Queen was at fir&s;t de&s;irous to be there, but being inform|ed after what manner they u&s;ed the&s;e poor Crea|tures, &s;he imagined that &s;uch a &s;ight would ra|ther give her occa&s;ion to employ her Pity, than afford her any Plea&s;ure. The King in all his Chaces generally took no more with him than the fir&s;t Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the great Fore&s;ter; he loved to find him&s;elf alone in va&s;t Solitudes, and &s;ometimes it was a long while before they could find him. When he hunted after the <HI>German</HI> manner, he would be accompanied by the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana.</HI> At his return, the Chief Mini&s;ter following the King to the Queen's A|partment, found that her Maje&s;ty did not ca&s;t her Eyes upon him; he immediately penetrated into the rea&s;on of this alteration he found in the Queen's Behaviour; for to &s;ay the truth, &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed with him for di&s;&s;wading his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="111" REF="113">
to expedite a Patent for a Government in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which he had granted to her: But when the Duke knew it, he told the King, That the Queen begged this Grace of him, at the intreaty of one of the Women of her Bed-Chamber, who was a <HI>French</HI> Woman, who would get con&s;ider|ably by it, when in the mean time Twelve thou|&s;and Pi&s;toles were offered for it. The King thought it was the be&s;t way to take this Sum, and after this would not hear the lea&s;t Word of di&s;patching the Patent, as he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>But what provoked the Queen infinitely more, was the Conduct he had u&s;ed in her Ab&s;ence to|wards the Con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI>'s Lady. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed her Word to the Queen, as in her Husband's Name, That du|ring the &s;tay her Maje&s;ty made at the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> nothing &s;hould be done to the prejudice of this Lady. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e A&s;&s;urances, upon which &s;he depended, &s;he was carried away from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and by an Order from the King, confi|ned to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Segovia.</HI> To begin this Sto|ry from its Original, the Reader is to know, that this Lady was Niece to the late Cardinal <HI>Maza|rine:</HI> She brought a very con&s;iderable Fortune with her at her Marriage; and perhaps the Fa|mily of the <HI>Colonna</HI>'s had &s;unk very low without this &s;ea&s;onable Relief. After &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the happie&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ant part of her Life at <HI>Rome,</HI> where &s;he always appeared in great Pomp and Splendor, having the liberty to live after the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion, and according to all Appearan|ces, &s;eeming to be content with her Fortune: She withdrew all on the &s;udden, without &s;o much as knowing the Rea&s;on of it her &s;elf, through the ill Coun&s;els of &s;ome Per&s;ons, who hazarded not a little upon her Account, in making her hazard every thing on her &s;ide: So that &s;he departed pri|vately
<PB N="112" REF="114">
with the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Mazarine,</HI> her Si&s;tet. They had di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o well, that none knew them when they took Shipping: And thus they arrived &s;afely in <HI>France.</HI> The Con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI>'s Lady hoped to find here a Sanctuary again&s;t her Husband, and &s;ome vain flattering Idea's, that were not as yet perfectly extingui&s;h|ed in her Heart, &s;erved to per&s;wade her, that &s;he &s;hould be well received at Court; but &s;o far was &s;he from meeting any Encouragement to make her Appearance there, that &s;he was prohibited by the King to come there. I have heard her &s;ay, That &s;he re&s;ented this Treatment with &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Grief, that &s;he was like to have died of it. Af|ter this &s;he went to <HI>Turin,</HI> where &s;he made a &s;hort &s;tay, and the unea&s;ine&s;s of her Mind led her at la&s;t to <HI>Flanders.</HI> There &s;he happened to find the Marque&s;s <HI>de Borgomaine,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>E&s;te,</HI> in whom &s;he repo&s;ed an intire Con&s;idence, without remembering that he was rather a Friend to her Husband than to her &s;elf. He flattered her in all her Projects, in order to amu&s;e her, and to gain time till he might receive Advice from the Con&s;table, how to di&s;po&s;e of her; for he had &s;ent him a Letter, by a Courier for that purpo&s;e, to inform him, that his Wife was at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>; and in An&s;wer to it, the Con&s;table earne&s;tly de|&s;ired him to Seize and Apprehend her. He ac|quitted him&s;elf immediately of his Commi&s;&s;ion, and carried her to a Convent, from whence &s;he was not to depart, unle&s;s &s;he would con&s;ent to be Ship'd for <HI>Spain,</HI> as they de&s;ired her. When &s;he was at <HI>Madrid</HI> &s;he delay'd, upon &s;everal Pre|tences, to take the Religious Habit upon her; &s;he loved her Liberty and was de&s;irous &s;till to enjoy it: But the Con&s;table being informed of her Ar|rival, &s;ent <HI>Don Fornand de Colonna,</HI> his Natural Brother, with Letters to the King, and the Mi|ni&s;ters
<PB N="113" REF="115">
wherein he be&s;eech'd them, that either by fair means, or violence they would oblige his Lady to enter into a Convent. This Nece&s;&s;ity &s;eemed very hard to her; neverthele&s;s &s;he &s;ub|mitted to it, and retired to the Mona&s;tery <HI>de Santo Domingo el Real,</HI> upon Condition, That if &s;he happened to come out of it, &s;he would con&s;ent that the King &s;hould re&s;tore her to her Husband. She continued there a long time, and &s;ometimes in an Evening &s;he e&s;caped out with one of her Women, and often went to walk on Foot in a White Mantle in the <HI>Pardo,</HI> where &s;he met with many plea&s;ant Adventures, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the Women that come there are Ladies Ad|venturers; and &s;ome Ladies of the be&s;t Quality at Court, take a mighty plea&s;ure when they can go thither and are not known.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI> being ceme to <HI>Madrid,</HI> in his way to <HI>Arragon,</HI> whereof he was Vice-Roy, went every day to entertain her at the Grate, and I have &s;een him &s;how tho&s;e Gallantries to her, which a Lover may &s;how to his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He departed in a very good under&s;tanding with her; but when the Queen made her entry, &s;he having a great de&s;ire to behold her Maje&s;ty, did not ima|gine they would hold her &s;o &s;trictly to the Word &s;he had given the King, That in ca&s;e &s;he ever quitted the place of her Confinement, he &s;hould deliver her into her Husband's Hands: So with|out any more a do, &s;he went to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez,</HI> her Si&s;ter in Law, who re|ceived her very kindly, and the Marque&s;s made her an Entertainment that might have deceived a Per&s;on of le&s;s Faith than her &s;elf. Seeing the&s;e fair Appearances &s;he thought no more of return|ing to <HI>Santo Domingo,</HI> but &s;taid with the Marchi|one&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez.</HI> All this while he &s;ecret|ly endeavoured to get an Order from the King,
<PB N="114" REF="116">
and as &s;oon as he had procured it, carried her to a Convent within Four Leagues of <HI>Madrid.</HI> So &s;evere a Procedure afflicted her as much as it is po&s;&s;ible for a Woman to be afflicted. She wrote to the Queen to demand her Protection; and be|ing informed that the Con&s;table was come back from <HI>Arragon,</HI> with his Sons, &s;he obtained a per|mi&s;&s;ion of the King to go into &s;ome Mona&s;tery or other at <HI>Madrid.</HI> But whether it were, that &s;he was not content to be there, or that &s;he had &s;ome other Views in her Head, &s;he made her e&s;cape, and went &s;trait to her Husband's Hou&s;e: She li|ved in one half of it, made her Court very regu|larly to the Queen, vi&s;ited abundance of Ladies, and diverted her &s;elf very well.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table left her an intire Liberty to do what &s;he plea&s;ed; but when he was de&s;irous to return to <HI>Rome,</HI> he talked of carrying his Lady along with him thither. She was migtily A|larmed at it, and declared, that &s;he would not go. The Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e &s;he had got her Nativity to be Calculated, and it was told her, That if &s;he had another Child, &s;he &s;hould die. This Prediction was &s;o fre&s;h in her imagination that &s;he would rather chu&s;e to return to her old place of Retreat. The King was urgent with her to explain her meaning; She &s;ent him Word back again, That &s;he humbly reque&s;ted him to grant her his Protection, in the de&s;ign &s;he had to throw her &s;elf into a Convent.</P>
<P>The King judged it convenient, That the In|qui&s;itor General, <HI>Don Melchior Navarra,</HI> and his Confe&s;&s;or, &s;hould meet to determine this dif+ference between the Con&s;table and his Lady&punc; The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez</HI> &s;ollicited &s;o powerfully, that the <HI>Juncto</HI> concluded to &s;end her to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Segovia.</HI> This he &s;o pa&s;&s;i|onately <PB N="115" REF="117">
de&s;ired, that all the la&s;t Year he was perpetually troubling his Brain, how to do her &s;ome ill Office. But the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the Admiral, &s;et them&s;elves all they could to oppo&s;e it; and they were not able to obtain an Order for it.</P>
<P>They had never obtained one, if the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> had not been an Enemy to the Con|&s;table's Lady. She being informed of what had pa&s;t again&s;t her, and what Rea&s;ons &s;he had to ap|prehend &s;ome Mi&s;chief from her Enemies, ca&s;t her &s;elf at the Queen's Feet, and conjured her, with Tears in her Eyes, not to abandon her in this di&s;tre&s;s, but to engage the Chief Mini&s;ter to pa&s;s his Word, that nothing &s;hould be at|tempted again&s;t her as long as the Court was at the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> The Queen interpo&s;ed in this Af|fair, as I have already mentioned; but notwith|&s;tanding all this Precaution, within Eight Days after her departure, a Coun&s;ellor of the Coun&s;el Royal, with his Officers, Accompanied by the Con&s;table <HI>Colonna,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Bal|bazez,</HI> who performed the Office of Bailiffs, be|ing all Armed, as if they had been going to ap|prehend a Ring-Leader of Robbers, rather than an unfotrunate Lady, who was not capable of making the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, went about Eleven a Clock at Night to break open the Doors of her Appartment, although it was within her Hus|band's Hou&s;e. She was in her Chamber, when immediately an <HI>Alcade</HI> of the Court pretended to tie her Arms with a Cord: Seing her&s;elf u&s;ed after &s;o ignominious a manner, &s;he took up a lit|tle Knife, which lay accidenttally up on the Ta|ble; and as &s;he defended her &s;elf, gave him a cut in the Hand. This Re&s;i&s;tance made the re&s;t of the Company fall upon her with that barba|rous Fury, that they dragged the poor Lady, half
<PB N="116" REF="118">
naked, as &s;he was, by the Hairs of her Head, and &s;o they forced oer away, like one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of her Sex. She was conducted after this manner, all Night long, to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Se|govia,</HI> without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t con&s;ideration either for her Birth or Reputation, although &s;he had given them no occa&s;ion to treat her thus; for in fine, &s;he was actually at that time in her Hus|band's Hou&s;e, and her only Crime was, her re|fu&s;ing to return to <HI>Rome</HI> with the Con&s;table, al|though &s;he offered to go into a Convent, with|out having the liberty ever to leave it. Mo&s;t Per|&s;ons pitied her &s;orrowful Condition, and took it ill that they broke their Promi&s;e to the Queen, and that they dur&s;t employ the King's Name, on|ly to &s;atisfie the Malice and Animo&s;ity of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez.</HI> It was for his &s;ake principally that they u&s;ed this Per&s;ecution to|wards the Con&s;table's Lady; for her Husband was one of the be&s;t conditioned Men in the World: He loved her, and as he had formerly given her his con&s;ent to &s;tay &s;everal Years in a Religious Hou&s;e; &s;o without que&s;tion he had not now oppo&s;ed the Conditions &s;he de&s;ired, if it had not been for the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balba|zez.</HI></P>
<P>He alone managed this Affair, and &s;ollicited the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> in the Con&s;table's Name; and that Mini&s;ter thinking by this means to oblige both of them, gave his con&s;ent to what was demanded of him.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it was a &s;urpri&s;ing thing, that he u&s;ed &s;o rude a Conduct towards the on C&s;table's Lady; it had been a more generous and manly part, to endeavour to reconcile the pre&s;ent Dif|ferences than to impri&s;on a Lady who was to be Mother in Law to his own Daughter. He ought to have con&s;idered, that a Husband and a Wife
<PB N="117" REF="119">
are ea&s;ily brought to accommodate matters; and that if ever they came to be Friends again, his Daughter would fall into the Hands of the Con|&s;table's Lady, who would then be in a condition to revenge her &s;elf upon her, for the Injuries he had done her. He might rea&s;onably imagine, that as &s;he was rich, and had a great number of near Relations, who made a con&s;iderable Figure in the World; &s;o they would never &s;ee her op|pre&s;s'd, without regretting her misfortunes, and intere&s;ting them&s;elves in her Quarrel: That they would vigorou&s;ly endeavour to procure her her Liberty, and that at the bottom, when he came to ca&s;t up his Accounts, he him&s;elf would get no|thing but ill will by it.</P>
<P>This Affair made a great noi&s;e in the World: I knew every particular Circum&s;tance of the Sto|ry, becau&s;e I was intimately acquainted with this Unfortunate Lady, and knew her to be of a good Di&s;po&s;ition, and not given to &s;peak ill of other People, and, as it was truly &s;aid of her, &s;he was never an Enemy to any one but her &s;elf. Indeed it were to be wi&s;hed, &s;he had been Mi&s;tre&s;s of more Di&s;cretion, and had not been of &s;o ea&s;ie a Temper as to believe tho&s;e Per&s;ons who advi&s;ed her ill. She was very lovely, al|though &s;he was not in the Prime of her Youth; her Eyes were lively, quick and piercing; her Teeth admirable; her Hair blaker than Jet, and in a great quantity; her Stature noble, and her Leg well-&s;haped. The Queen being informed of her Misfortunes, was mighitily concerned at them, and continued to be very angry with the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> for not keeping his Promi&s;e to her.</P>
<P>The Calamities occa&s;ioned by the Plague, were not the only Evils, which the People of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;uffered. The publick Poverty &s;pread it
<PB N="118" REF="120">
&s;elf farther &s;till; for the &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions continued, and no Remedies were applied to rectifie the&s;e Di&s;orders. No alteration was made in the Government, and the Chief Mini&s;ter &s;eem|ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Lethargy. Every body hung down his Head, and Men were &s;o enfee|bled, that they had &s;carce &s;trength enough to lift up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven, to implore its A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Relief. The pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Mi&s;eries made them apprehend what was to fol|low; every one made melancholy Reflections upon the &s;ad condition of Affairs, which carried them farther than they de&s;ired: But to compleate the general Calamity, after they had for &s;ix Weeks together beheld terrible Inundations that did a world of Mi&s;chief in &s;everal goodly Ci|ties, the&s;e Accidents were followed by an Earth|quake, which happened two days after the King's departure to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> We perceived it at <HI>Madrid</HI> on thh 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> between &s;ix and &s;even a Clock in the Morning; it was &s;o vi|olent, that it made a general Concu&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t re&s;olute Per&s;ons were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with fear. This extraordinary Motion was perceived all the Kingdom over, and even at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Portugal</HI>; but the City of <HI>Malaga</HI> found the &s;adde&s;t Effects, and &s;u&s;tained the greate&s;t Lo&s;|&s;es by it.</P>
<P>This City is &s;ituated in the Kingdom of <HI>Gra|nada,</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean Sea, within Twenty five Leagues of the <HI>Straights,</HI> at the foot of a Mountain, upon the top of which &s;tands a Ca&s;tle that Commands the Town and and the Port. It is large, well peopled, and rich, by rea&s;on of the con&s;iderable Trade they drive in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, Oyl, Citrons, Fruits, and other Commodities, which draw a va&s;t number of Ve&s;&s;els to that Port. Its Fortifications, although
<PB N="119" REF="121">
they are old, are very good, and are adorned with &s;everal &s;tately Buildings, which are remainders of the Magnificence of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and the Cathe|dral Church was formerly the Principal Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>They perceived there a great Trembling of the Earth, which la&s;ted but a few moments; how|ever the Concu&s;&s;ions were &s;o violent, that they cau&s;ed a general fear and de&s;olation in the City by the &s;trange di&s;order it occa&s;ioned. The Har|bour, and the Walls on the &s;ame &s;ide, with their Bulwarks, Towers, and Ramparts were over|thrown; the Sea was in &s;o extraordinary an agi|tation, that the Fi&s;hes every where leapt out of the Water; the Ve&s;&s;els that were in the Port, were lifted up above Twenty Foot high, and all their &s;ides crack'd as if they had been in a real Tempe&s;t, &s;o that the Mariners believed they were unavoidably lo&s;t. Fifteen Convents of Men and Women were ruined after that manner, that &s;carce one Stone lay upon another; and in that of the Ob&s;ervance of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> there were Fourteen Per&s;ons buried in the Ruins.</P>
<P>This Magnificent Church, which had been En|larged and Beautified in the Year 1521, leaned &s;everal times on its two &s;ides ready to overturn, and yet received no damage, which the Inhabi|tants took for a Miracle. One thou&s;and three hundred Hou&s;es were &s;orely battered, and more than One thou&s;and two hundred ruined. 'Tis ea&s;ie to judge what a va&s;t number of Per&s;ons mu&s;t have been killed, hurt and buried in this Confu&s;ion. As &s;oon as the Earthquake had cea&s;ed, the Bi&s;hop, followed by his Clergy, and a great multitude of People, went in Proce&s;&s;ion to the Church, to implore the Divine Commi&s;e|ration. A&s;&s;uredly in the&s;e &s;orts of Occa&s;ions the mo&s;t irreligious hardned Per&s;ons pray heartily and &s;incerely.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
The Inhabitants being affrighted, retired into the Country, fearing to be over-whelmed in the City by &s;ome new Concu&s;&s;ion, but &s;everal Hou&s;es fell down all about <HI>Malaga</HI>; a great Mountain was perfectly overthrown; the Earth opened in a|bundance of places, and ca&s;t up Water in &s;uch prodigious quantities, that great Torrents were occa&s;ioned by it, which &s;welled the Rivers &s;o as to make them overflow their Banks. 'Twas ob|&s;ervable that the Wall of the Church <HI>d'Alhavrin</HI> opened it &s;elf the breadth of four Foot, and af|terwards clo&s;ed again, &s;o that the place where this fi&s;&s;ure happened, could not be di&s;cerned. The Ja&s;per Pillars in the &s;ame Church were removed from their Pede&s;tals, but afterwards returned to their old place, and &s;u&s;tained no damage. At the City of <HI>Velez Malaga,</HI> the Earth opened and &s;wallowed up a River which runs near it; after this it clo&s;ed again with &s;o terrible a noi&s;e, and threw up the Water with &s;o great a violence, that it ro&s;e above ten Pikes higher than the Hou&s;es, and had like to have over whelmed every thing when it fell down.</P>
<P>Several Cities here were entirely overthrown, and the Earthquake did a great deal of mi&s;chief at <HI>Sevil, Corduba,</HI> and at <HI>Jaen,</HI> where Places and Churches, and many Hou&s;es were ruined. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any thing in Nature to be more terrible than this was; for no body knew where to &s;ave them&s;elves, and Death &s;eemed to pur&s;ue them where-ever they fled.</P>
<P>A few days after this Earthquake, there hap|pened at Night a Tempe&s;tuous Storm, which overturned part of the Roof of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> broke the Cry&s;tal Windows of the King's Apart|ment, and tore up abundance of Trees in the Garden by the Roots. The King perceiving the Queen to be affrighted at it, was &s;o complai&s;ant
<PB N="121" REF="123">
as to ri&s;e with her, and &s;ent for &s;ome Company to come to her Chamber, and comfort her a little.</P>
<P>It has been a Cu&s;tom long ago e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Spain,</HI> that when any thing happens, the truth of which they cannot immediately di&s;cover, for the Mini&s;ters to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>France</HI> had a hand in it. Thus they had received certain Advice, that the Count <HI>d'E&s;tries</HI> had &s;ailed with &s;everal Men of War in his Company for the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and therefore they pre&s;ently concluded, that it was he who burnt <HI>Porto-bello</HI>; but they were in|formed of the contrary by two Ve&s;&s;els, which were arrived from the <HI>Honduras</HI> at the Port of <HI>Cales,</HI> laden with Six thou&s;and Che&s;ts of <HI>Indigo,</HI> and Two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pia&s;ters.</HI> The&s;e brought word, that &s;ome <HI>Bucaniers,</HI> command|ed by an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> had landed at the Port <HI>de Ba&s;timentos,</HI> and after five days march in the Mountains, had attackued <HI>Porto-bello</HI>; that the the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gari&s;on threw away their Arms, and retired without fighting a &s;troke into the Cita|del; that a poor <HI>Negro,</HI> who was Seventy Years old, had marched out of it, followed by Twenty five Soldiers, and made a brave Re&s;i&s;tance, but was killed upon the place, being abandoned by his Men. The <HI>Bucaniers</HI> carried away Thirty &s;ix thou&s;and Crowns, and all the Booty they were able to take with them. In fine, having pa&s;&s;ed the Gulf of <HI>Darien,</HI> and being conducted by the <HI>Indians,</HI> that were Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they arrived through unknown ways in nine days to the South Sea, within a League of <HI>Panama:</HI> They imbarked in this place in &s;ome <HI>Canoos,</HI> and pa&s;|&s;ed by Port <HI>de Perico,</HI> where they made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of three Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;everal Barks. They went from thence to pillage the Suburbs of <HI>Panama,</HI> the Garri&s;on of which place, without
<PB N="122" REF="124">
making any Re&s;i&s;tance, retired to a Ba&s;tion, with the Pre&s;ident and the Auditors of the Ex|chequer. The <HI>Bucaniers</HI> continned &s;ome days Ma&s;ters of the Sea, but at la&s;t departed, upon Information that a Relief of Four Hundred Men was coming from <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and that two Ve&s;&s;els were &s;etting Sail from <HI>Lima,</HI> to oppo&s;e their De&s;igns. The Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> high|ly provoked again&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, who had &s;hew'd &s;o little Courage upon this Occa&s;i|on, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and re&s;olved to &s;end Three Hundred <HI>Veterane</HI> Soldiers to reinforce the Garri&s;ons. They gave full Authority to <HI>Don Melchior Navarra,</HI> who was named to go Vice-Roy for <HI>Peru,</HI> to condemn without Appeal the Officers and other Soldiers that were found guilty, and to decimate them, in ca&s;e he found them all in fault, as it was believed here.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall Mortification to them to hear of the taking of a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Lading whereof was com|puted to be worth Four Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns in Goods. Six Ships of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> took her near <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> This Prince was highly enraged at the ill Treatment of his Envoy, and it &s;eems the Menaces he gave them ju&s;t as he left <HI>Madrid,</HI> were not without effect. 'Twas believed here, that he had done him&s;elf too much Ju&s;tice; but others, who con&s;idered this Action without prejudice, were agreed, that it was but Natural for the E|lector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> to make recour&s;e to vio|lence, after the unfair mea&s;ures they had kept with him; which he had &s;o much the le&s;s Rea|&s;on to expect, becau&s;e he was devoted to the Intere&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and had chiefly &s;upported it in the la&s;t War. But if the&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;erved to excu&s;e him, there were
<PB N="123" REF="125">
others that laid &s;ome blemi&s;h upon him, to u&s;e &s;uch an Action of Ho&s;tility towards a King, with whom he was in Peace, and who had ne|ver failed on his &s;ide to &s;atisfie him, unle&s;s he had been utterly uncapable of paying him: That at the very time when the Envoy from <HI>Brandenburg</HI> demanded the Money, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had not enough to defray the Expences of his Hou&s;hold, and that if he had been in o|ther Circum&s;tances, he had dealt better by him.</P>
<P>The Court was not a little troubled at this Infraction of the Peace; and now they had a fre&s;h Argument to grieve them. They were inform|ed that the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> pretended to keep the I&s;land of St. <HI>Gabriel</HI> to them&s;elves, and that although <HI>Bueno&s;aires</HI> lay &s;o near it, yet they were in a Condition to maintain them&s;elves there. The Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> lying &s;o near, fa|voured, them as well as the River, who&s;e Channel is &s;o very narrow in that place, that it was an ea&s;ie matter to Command it, and to hinder all Commerce. The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> it &s;eems had en|tred the the River <HI>de Plata</HI>; and all the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances were the more affiicting, becau&s;e it was certainly known that a Squadron of <HI>Bran|denburghers</HI> was gone for the <HI>Indies.</HI> This Af|fair was talked of, and the Council met about it: But tho&s;e that were well acquainted with the Genius of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation, were &s;atisfied that the Alarm would not la&s;t very long; be|cau&s;e at Court they look upon dangers that are at any di&s;tance, but as &s;o many things that will never happen.</P>
<P>The King and Queen being come back to <HI>Madrid</HI> from the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> every one was very forward to make his Court to them; and on the Fourth of <HI>November,</HI> which was the Fe&s;ti|val
<PB N="124" REF="126">
of St. <HI>Charles,</HI> His Maje&s;ty went to the Chap+pel in the Palace, where the Amba&s;&s;adors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Crowned Heads appeared to Compliment him and &s;everal of the Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> who ki&s;&s;ed his Hand according to the Cu&s;tom. The King was dre&s;s'd in a Suit, the Ground-Stuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> whereof was black, with Flowers of Gold, Em+broider'd with Pearls, and a large Diamond in the mid&s;t of every Flower. His Chain, to which the Order of the Fleece was fa&s;tened, glitter|ed with &s;everal Emeralds half a Finger long&punc; The Queen-Mother writ to the Queen in the Morning, de&s;iring her to dre&s;s her &s;elf that day after the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion. The Queen carried this Billet to the King, and after &s;he had read it to him, asked him, if he would agree to it&punc; He told her, &s;he look'd &s;o pretty in her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dr&s;s, that he prayed her not to quit that Habit on a Day of Rejoicing.</P>
<P>The King took away the Receipt and Amini|&s;tration of the Revenues of of <HI>Madrid</HI> from the <HI>Corregidors</HI> and <HI>Regidors,</HI> when he knew their Cheats and Villanies. He intru&s;ted the manage|ment of them to a Council compo&s;ed of four Per&s;ons, <HI>Don Lopez de los Rios, Don Andrea Villaran, Don Franci&s;co Carrillo,</HI> and <HI>Don Jo&s;eph Benavidez</HI>; and empowred them to make the <HI>Regidors</HI> give them an account of their Admini|&s;tration. They were accu&s;ed to have gotten the Sum of Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns by the Expences of the Queen's Entry, and by the Building of the New Bridge at <HI>Toledo,</HI> which was carried away by the Waters of the <HI>Manca|nares.</HI> At the &s;ame time the Collecting of the Impo&s;ts upon Wine, Victuals, and Coals, was taken away from them. The&s;e Alterations di|mini&s;hed the Profits of their Offices &s;o mighti|ly, that they could &s;carce get any People to bid
<PB N="125" REF="127">
&s;ix Thou&s;and Ducats for them, whereas be|fore this Reformation, it was an u&s;ual thing to give Ninety Thou&s;and, although the Salaries were not above Six Hundred Ducats.</P>
<P>The Chief Mini&s;ter had &s;ent a Commi&s;&s;io|ner &s;ome Months before to the Frontiers of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> to adju&s;t the Rights of both Sides with the <HI>French,</HI> but he being fond of his Commi&s;|&s;ion, endeavoured to prolong it, and &s;o deci|ded none of the Differences. There were &s;ome Regiments at <HI>Bayonne</HI> po&s;ted all along the Ri|ver of <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa,</HI> and &s;ome Brigandines blocked up the Mouth of it to hinder the Inhabitants of <HI>Fontarabia</HI> from all manner of Traffick. They could not go out to Fi&s;h, or commit any of tho&s;e Acts of Ho&s;tility, to which they had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed: And now they were given to under&s;tand, that they &s;hould be kept thus impri|&s;on'd till the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> had con&s;ented to a Rea&s;onable Accommodation. Whil&s;t matters continued in this Po&s;ture, the Brigandines pre|tended to go away; immediately the <HI>Bi&s;cayners</HI> began to Fi&s;h, but the <HI>French</HI> coming back upon them, carried them away Pri&s;oners, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Barks. As &s;oon as this News was brought to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Mini&s;ters began to exclaim that this was an unheard of Violence, and &s;uch an infraction of the Peace, as was never to be endured. But his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty ordered his Amba&s;&s;a|dor to acquaint them that they then ought to re|move the difficulties which occa&s;ion'd &s;o many Di&s;orders; or till they were regulated to con&s;ent to follow the deci&s;ions which the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>France</HI> had made after the Treaty of Peace.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Quality who had follow|ed the King to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> and came back from thence before him, told us, that he had &s;trong
<PB N="126" REF="128">
conjectures to believe that the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> had fallen out with the Queen-Mother. However, few Per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected it at that time; but after the return of the Court to <HI>Madrid,</HI> it was plain and vi&s;ible. Some People pretend that the Duke was wearied with the great num|ber of Creatures, whom the Queen-Mother dai|ly recommended to him, and to whom he was forced to di&s;tribute part of his Favours; that now he did not look upon her as any longer ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his Fortune, and therefore was not willing to grant the frequent Demands &s;he made him; that in order to break off with her all at once, he found it convenient to vi&s;it her no more, but expre&s;s a great coldne&s;s towards her. On the contrary, there were other Per&s;ons that &s;aid, that it was occa&s;ion'd by the Queen-Mother her &s;elf, who was not able to con&s;train her &s;elf &s;o far as to &s;uffer the pre&s;ence of a Man, who minded nothing but how to advance his Family or Friends, and never &s;how'd any Civilities to her. There were others &s;till that were of Opinion, that the Duke's behaviour towards the Queen-Mother was not the re&s;ult of his own Inclinations, but proceeded from the Sugge&s;tions of <HI>Don Geronimo D'Eguya,</HI> and indeed it might be &s;o, if it were not for the two following Rea&s;ons: The fir&s;t is becau&s;e there was not the lea&s;t appearance of any particular mo+tive to engage him to de&s;ire a Rupture between the Queen-Mother and the Duke; the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> is, that &s;uppo&s;ing he had &s;uch a De&s;ign, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>D'Eguya</HI> did not at that time &s;tand &s;o firm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the King's good Graces, as that the Chief M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+ni&s;ter &s;hould think it worth his while to giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> him &s;o great a Proof of his deference: N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> 'tis certain that they had a picque again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> another for &s;ome time, the &s;ubtil in&s;inuati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">

Humour of <HI>De Eguya</HI> made him always em|brace the Intere&s;ts of the mo&s;t fortunate, and he found him&s;elf under certain Circum&s;tan|ces, which advi&s;ed him not to pre&s;s too far, for fear of di&s;obliging the chief Mini&s;ter. But notwith&s;tanding the coldne&s;s which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them, the King when he was at the <HI>E&s;cu|rial,</HI> told <HI>D'Eguya</HI> one day very angrily, that if he was not more punctual for the future, to come and help him in the Di&s;patches, he would do all the bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>Vibanco,</HI> who was Se|cretary to the <HI>Chamber,</HI> and for whom the King &s;hew'd Inclination enough.</P>
<P>The Duke immediately, whether out of Ge|nero&s;ity, or Politick, excu&s;ed <HI>De Eguya</HI> &s;o hand|&s;omely, that he &s;et him right in the King's Fa|vour again; and this Obligation, for which <HI>De Eguya</HI> was indebted to him, made them be in a good Under&s;tanding with one another.</P>
<P><HI>De Eguya</HI> finding him&s;elf &s;o well with the Duke, confirmed him in all the di&s;po&s;itions he already had, not only in regard to the Queen-Mother, but al&s;o to the Young Queen.</P>
<P>He repre&s;ented to him, <Q REND="inline">That the&s;e Two Prince&s;&s;es could do nothing for him; That the King would take it well to find him te|&s;tifie a Devotion only to his own Per&s;on, and that he would an&s;wer him with his Affection better, when he &s;aw it was not divided.</Q>  His true De&s;ign in &s;peaking to him after this man|ner, was only to keep him to him&s;elf, that &s;o the Chief Mini&s;ter might repo&s;e an intire con|fidence in him.</P>
<P>In fine, they were both agreed, that in order to render the Duke an ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to re&s;olve to refu&s;e the two Queens whatever Offices or Employments they begged for their Creatures. The Duke ima|gined
<PB N="128" REF="130">
that this Coun&s;el proceeded from a true motive of Zeal, which he thought abounded in <HI>De Euguya,</HI> and believed him &s;o heartily, that he would do nothing but by his Advice. The Duke was generally complained of, for &s;uffering him&s;elf to be manag'd like a Child, by the only Man of <HI>Spain,</HI> who as he was a Per&s;on of the greate&s;t Court&s;hip, &s;o he was likewi&s;e of the lea&s;t Sincerity.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue the Project of di&s;gu&s;ting the Queen-Mother, the Chief Mini&s;ter ordered Pen|&s;ions to be given to &s;everal Per&s;ons who were directly oppo&s;ite to her; the Duke <HI>De villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> who had got enough in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> were in this number. The Marque&s;s <HI>De A&s;torgas</HI> was made ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, although he was Comptroller of the Queen's Hou&s;hold; and that &s;ingle place, with the Wealth he had heaped up in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> might very well &s;uffice a Man of his Age. The Chief Mini&s;ter afterwards a&s;&s;ign'd pen&s;ions ro the Women of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> out of the <HI>Bol&s;illo,</HI> which is a &s;ort of a privy Pur&s;e for the King's Hou&s;e, and other private Expences. He gratified &s;everal of his own Dome&s;ticks after the &s;ame manner, whil&s;t tho&s;e belonging to the King lay under &s;uch great Nece&s;&s;ities, that they found them&s;elves ob|liged to quit his Service for meer Want and Poverty.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> gave one Proof of his Power, which &s;ucceeded a great deal bet|ter than one could have have believed. On the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> he married one of his Re|lations, who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Augu&s;tine Hen|riquez de Gu&s;man,</HI> a Cadet of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gu&s;man,</HI> very poor, and of little or no Me|rit, to <HI>Donna <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aura,</HI> only Daughter to the
<PB N="129" REF="131">
Duke <HI>de Montalte,</HI> who was but fifteen years old, and &s;o rich, that &s;he was looked upon to be the be&s;t Match in all <HI>Spain,</HI> as well upon the Account of her Father's va&s;t E&s;tate, as tho&s;e of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Oropeza,</HI> who&s;e Fortunes &s;he was to inherit, in ca&s;e they had no Children. This Affair was the Work of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Medi|na Celi: Don Augu&s;tine de Ga&s;man</HI> had waited upon her with &s;o much A&s;&s;iduity, that to re|compence his Services, &s;he procured this Mar|riage for him. All the World was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at it; but no body could compre|hend upon what Con&s;iderations the Duke <HI>de Montalte</HI> con&s;ented to &s;acrifice his Daughter to Policy. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Velez,</HI> the Count <HI>de Oropeza,</HI> and all the re&s;t of their Family were hereupon mightily enraged at the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI>; they quitted his Intere&s;ts, which they had hitherto embraced with Zeal, and they openly declared, that they would re|&s;ent &s;o di&s;honourable an Alliance as long as they lived. The Count <HI>de Oropeza</HI> made parti|cular Complaints again&s;t the Duke, becau&s;e he had contributed more than any one to his Ele|vation, and that if he had been minded to have taken Advantage of the Favourable Di&s;|po&s;itions his Maje&s;ty had to him, It is certain, that when <HI>Don Juan</HI> was dead, he might have been made Chief Mini&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding he was &s;o young: But as he had a great Re&s;pect for the Duke, he imagined, that if he vigorous|ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him upon &s;o important an occa&s;ion, he would always remember him for his Servi|ces; and that if he did not rule by him&s;elf, he &s;hould at lea&s;t govern by his Friend. In this he found both Repo&s;e and Security together, he flat|tered him&s;elf with di&s;po&s;ing of Favours, and be|ing
<PB N="130" REF="132">
defended from the Aver&s;ion of the People. The&s;e Reflections engaged him to employ all his Wit, and all his Credit with the King to de|clare the Duke his Chief Mini&s;ter. But for all this Obligation, which was tran&s;cendent, and for which he was &s;o much indebted to him, he did not act fairly with relation to the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Montalte</HI>; for altho' the Count <HI>de Oropeza</HI> was her Uncle, yet he knew nothing of her Marriage. The Marchio|ne&s;s <HI>De Los Velez,</HI> Grand-mother to this young Lady, was no better informed of it; they were married privately without any Ceremony, for fear le&s;t any one &s;hould come to di&s;turb the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>The King and Queen being willing to divert them&s;elves, went to <HI>Prado,</HI> to hunt there till St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Day; they came back from thence, by rea&s;on the Queen-Mother had a &s;light in|di&s;po&s;ition upon her, and they were de&s;irous to vi&s;it her every Day.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>Don Philip Vinzani,</HI> an able Chymi&s;t, who came from <HI>Naples</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> with <HI>Don Pedro de Arragon,</HI> received Orders from the Chief Mini&s;ter to examine the Mo|ney, which had been cried down &s;ome Months before, in order to &s;eparate the Silver from the Bra&s;s. It was pretended, that the King by this means would get Six Millions of Peices of Eight, and that he would employ them to &s;end con&s;iderable Forces to Sea; for the Pope was willing that the Money which was to be col|lected by the Bulls of the <HI>Cra&s;ade,</HI> &s;hould be laid out to equip a Fleet, to make War again&s;t the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> of <HI>Barbary.</HI> At the &s;ame time they were apprehen&s;ive, that the Ve&s;&s;els &s;ent to the <HI>Indies</HI> had &s;uffered Ship-wrack, becau&s;e they had received Advice, that one of them arrived
<PB N="131" REF="133">
very much &s;hattered at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and they could not hear any News of the re&s;t. Although it is the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Spain</HI> for the King to dine with the Knights of the Golden-Fleece on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s day, his Maje&s;ty di&s;pen&s;ed with it, to take the diver&s;ion of Hunting. As he came back from <HI>Prado,</HI> towards the Evening, the two Queens went out to meet him, and conducted him to the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where they had pa&s;&s;ed the time ever &s;ince Noon. This Nobleman, who was always generous and magnificent, being in|formed that he was to receive this Honour, or|dered the Ba&s;ons of &s;everal Fountains to be en|compa&s;&s;ed with large Silver-Pots, filled with all manner of Victuals, Flowers and Fruits as the Sea&s;on produced, and the diver&s;ity joyned to the Order had a very agreeable effect upon the Eye. In all the Summer-hou&s;es which terminated the Walks, there were little Tables &s;et out with pieces of Cry&s;tal, Agate, Cornelian, and Tapi&s;try of Gold and Vermilion, having all &s;orts of things in Ba&s;ons, after the &s;ame manner as the Tables had. He got all &s;orts of Fruit counterfeited, particularly of Grapes which hung with their Leaves and Branches in the <HI>Grottas</HI>; they were compo&s;ed chiefly of little Carbuncles of a Pome|granate colour, Topazes, and Amethy&s;ts, and no|thing could look finer or prettier. The two Queens received a mighty &s;atisfaction at this Walk. As &s;oon as the King was arrived, they went into the Hou&s;e, where Fifteen Ladies and as many Cava|liers immediately appeared, dre&s;s'd after the fa&s;hi|on of the Country. The Ladies came at fir&s;t in their Mantles <HI>Tabados,</HI> that is to &s;ay, all their Face was covered except one Eye. The Cava|liers for their part, wore their Cloaks up to their No&s;es, and their Hats over their Eyes: This was a &s;ort of Masquerade, and to divert their Ma|je&s;ties
<PB N="132" REF="134">
they talked with their Fingers, and by Signs for &s;ome time, with all the &s;everal turns and ge&s;tures that are u&s;ed in this kind of dumb Conver&s;ation: Afterwards the Ladies quitted their Mantles, and the Lords their Cloaks, and be|gan to dance a Saraband after the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, holding one another with Taffata-Skarfs of dif|ferent colours, and quitting them &s;ometimes to carry Flambeaus in their Hands. The Women wore little Caps on their Heads, covered with Plumes that were rai&s;ed upon the fides very high. When the Saraband was fini&s;hed, the Ladies ki&s;&s;ed the Queen's Hand, and the Cava|liers the King's; their Maje&s;ties were plea&s;ed to declare, that they were extremely &s;atisfied with this pretty Entertainment. The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> knowing what Honour the King had done the Admiral, de&s;ired him that he would conde&s;cend to come and di|vert him&s;elf at their Hou&s;es, whither he went along with the two Queens. There were Co|medies there; and Artificial Fire-works, and a noble Collation: They omitted nothing that might te&s;tifie their Joy upon this Occa&s;ion, and their acknowledgment of &s;o great a Favour.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of <HI>December</HI> the King demand|ed a &s;upply of Money of all the Councils, and a Hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight of the Coun|cil of <HI>Italy.</HI> He propo&s;ed to &s;ell &s;ome Places to rai&s;e this Summ, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible to be rai&s;ed any other way.</P>
<P>The King being informed, that abundance of People died of &s;everal Di&s;tempers at <HI>Port St. Mary,</HI> which were chiefly occa&s;ioned by the great &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions, told the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> that &s;ome way or other mu&s;t be found out to remedy the&s;e Mi&s;eries, and that he could not endure to hear any more talk of them; that they
<PB N="133" REF="135">
had been of a long &s;tanding, which made him inclined to believe that all this proceeded from meer negligence. The Duke replied, that he would not lo&s;e one moment to redre&s;s them, and that if his Life would do the People any good, he was free to &s;acrifice it. He went home very melancholy, and having retired into his Clo&s;et with his Dutche&s;s, <HI>I have a great de&s;ire,</HI> &s;ays he to her, <HI>to abondon every thing, I &s;lave and kill my &s;elf here with bu&s;ine&s;s, and af|ter all, meet with nothing but Reproaches for my Pains. When you have once brought things into a good Condition,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>you may quit them if you plea&s;e; but if you leave them at pre&s;ent, all the World will conclude that it is through weakne&s;s.</HI> She added &s;o many rea&s;ons to the&s;e, that &s;he made him take Courage again, although he was mightily dejected. The Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Priego,</HI> his Son-in-law being come to <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee him, as he entred the Room, hit him&s;elf a little blow on the Temples again&s;t the edge of a Cabinet; he was immediately &s;eized with a bleeding at the No&s;e, and died of it in a &s;hort time after.</P>
<P>Our Amba&s;&s;ador prevailed with the King to give his con&s;ent to appoint a Judge <HI>Con&s;ervator,</HI> who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to look after all Affairs relating to the <HI>French</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was decided at la&s;t at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in favour of Con&s;table <HI>Colonna,</HI> upon the diffe|rence he had with the <HI>Roman</HI> Knights, Subjects to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> about the Priority they pretended to di&s;pute with him in the <HI>Cavalcade,</HI> which is every Year performed to pre&s;ent the the Pope with a white Mare, and a common Schedule for the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> holds in fief of the Holy See. His Catholick Maje&s;ty's Council had delay'd to regu|late
<PB N="134" REF="136">
this Affair ever &s;ince the year 1668. When the <HI>Roman</HI> Barons perceived, that it was not de|termined in favour of them, they &s;earched new occa&s;ions to get the Sentence revoked; and to &s;ucceed in their de&s;igns, they united them&s;elves with the Heads of the Papal Families, to write all of them together to <HI>Madrid</HI> about the Mat|ter: When the King was told of it, he only an|&s;wered, <HI>What is judged is judged.</HI> The Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> fell &s;ick; he &s;ent immediately for the Pope's Phy&s;ici|an to come to him, and when his Friends demand|ed of him why he cho&s;e him before his own, <HI>I am &s;o weary of my Life,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that I purpo&s;ely &s;end for one, who will &s;oone&s;t kill me, if it were only to plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter. The Pope being inform|ed of this An&s;wer, &s;ent one of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to vi&s;it him, and ordered him to tell the Marque&s;s, that he de&s;ired his Health as much as he did his Ab&s;ence, and by that judge whether he wi&s;hed his recovery or no.</HI></P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>December</HI> there was a great Earthquake in the Province of <HI>Salerne,</HI> as al&s;o at <HI>Naples,</HI> and the Places about it, neverthe|le&s;s it did no damage. It was commonly &s;aid at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the Queen-Mother had engaged the King to nominate Cardinal <HI>Nitard</HI> to be Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> and that &s;he hoped in a &s;hort time to &s;ee her two Favourites with her. The Cardinal was the fir&s;t, and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Va|lenzuela</HI> the &s;econd. The Marque&s;s <HI>de los Velez,</HI> who had no de&s;ire to quit his place, &s;ent the King (in order to fix him&s;elf in his good Graces) a &s;tately Coach of admirable Sculpture, and Em|broidered all over mo&s;t delicately. But although the King had &s;o many fine Coaches by him, I never &s;aw him in any of them; he ju&s;t ca&s;t his Eyes upon them, and then they were &s;hut up in a
<PB N="135" REF="137">
Coach hou&s;e, where time and the du&s;t ab&s;olutely &s;poiled them; the King rather loves to ride in great Coaches of Green Linnen waxed over, made after the &s;ame fa&s;hion with ours, and which a &s;imple Citizen of <HI>Paris</HI> would not vouch&s;afe to go in. The Marqui&s;s <HI>de los Velez</HI> &s;ent him likewi&s;e &s;ome <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Hor&s;es, but &s;o finely &s;haped, that nothing certainly ever came near them.</P>
<P>Few days pa&s;&s;ed wherein the King and Queen did not go a hunting, or el&s;e to &s;ee a Play; they went to <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> to behold &s;ome <HI>Dutchmen</HI> skate upon the Ice after the fa&s;hion of their Country. Some Ladies &s;ent to acquaint the Queen, that if her Maje&s;ty would permit them to appear masked, becau&s;e they had no mind to be known; they would &s;how her better &s;port than &s;he had hitherto &s;een. They were told that they might come if they plea&s;ed, and immedi|ately they went upon the Ice in &s;hort Petticoats, fine Shooes and Stockings, and Pattins after the <HI>Dutch</HI> manner; they danced a Saraband with Ca&s;tanets to admiration, moving as nimbly as the Dance would allow them; but the Ice not being equally thick in all places, broke under one of them, and let her fall into the Water, where &s;he had certainly been drowned, if People had not come to her help immediately. Having lo&s;t her Mask by this Mischance, they &s;aw &s;he was a very deformed old Woman, who was near Three&s;core Years old. When the Queen was told of it, &s;he &s;miled and an&s;wered, <HI>That at that Age it was lawful for any one to go masked.</HI></P>
<P>The two Queens on St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s day made a Pre&s;ent of precious Stones to the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Al|buquerque,</HI> becau&s;e it was her Birthday. She offered them in way of return, &s;ome Curio&s;ities of great Value, and particularly a Prayer-book
<PB N="136" REF="138">
to the young Queen, which was incomparably well Painted, with golden Cla&s;ps, and adorned with Diamonds. It being now towards the end of the Year, I went (according to Cu&s;tom) to wi&s;h her Maje&s;ty a happy <HI>New Year</HI>; &s;he was dre&s;s'd in a &s;light Stuff of White Wool, and had a prodi|gious quantity of large Pearls about her; &s;he &s;at near a great Ve&s;&s;el full of Olive &s;tones, and turning over the the Leaves of the Prayer-book which the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquerque</HI> had given her, did me the honour to &s;hew it me. <HI>See,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>here are</HI> Henry <HI>the Fourth, and</HI> Mary de Medicis <HI>on their Knees, &s;tretching out their Arms in their Oratory; it is certain that this Book was made for one of them. I was de&s;irous to know by what accident it came into</HI> Spain<HI>, and told her that perhaps Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>brought it thither.</HI> Up|on this &s;he called for the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquer|que,</HI> and asked her how &s;he came by it. The Dutche&s;s told her &s;he could not tell, but only that &s;he had received it of her Mother. The Queen &s;aid to me afterwards, <HI>Are you not &s;ur|prized to find me dre&s;s'd in White Woollen? 'Tis a &s;mall &s;ort of Devotion which the King and I perform, but no body &s;hall know the rea&s;on of it. Ah Madam, reply'd the Dutche&s;s</HI> de Pa&s;trane<HI>, we all of us take the liberty to divine. How &s;ays the Queen, without mi&s;taking? No, I am not po&s;itive &s;ays the Dutche&s;s. And for you, &s;aid &s;he to me, have you gue&s;s'd at the true cau&s;e? Yes, Madam, very ea&s;ily, reply'd I, and all</HI> Spain <HI>joyns its Vows with yours. Don't you know, &s;ays the Queen &s;miling, that this is none of the be&s;t Places in the World to play the Sorcere&s;s in, and that we have a horrible Inqui&s;ition here? The King entred the Room at that moment, &s;o the Queen ri&s;ing up, told him with a chearful Air, that &s;he had two Sorcere&s;&s;es to &s;hew him; and that the</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="139">
<HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> de Pa&s;trane <HI>and I had divined the My|&s;tery of her white Habit.</HI> The King, although in all appearance he &s;eemed to be in a good Hu|mour, he looked &s;o angrily upon us, and parti|cularly upon my &s;elf, whom he knew to be a <HI>French-Woman,</HI> that I made a profound Reve|rence; and went immediately out of the Queen's Apartment.</P>
<P>An Order was here publi&s;hed to rai&s;e the price of Money, which was reduced to a fourth part of its value.</P>
<P>Although the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> was indi&s;|po&s;ed, yet he did not neglect to inform him&s;elf diligently of every thing that happened, and he was not a little troubled to hear that the Plague began to rage again at <HI>Port St. Mary.</HI> The Scar|city and Poverty of this Country was &s;o extreme|ly great, that &s;everal Per&s;ons died daily for want; and the Duke <HI>de Medina Cidonia</HI> was obliged to &s;end Corn from <HI>Andaluzia</HI> thither. The Mi&s;ery was not le&s;s at <HI>Naples.</HI> The Pope's Nuncio, by his Holine&s;s's Order, Summoned the Superiours of all the Regular Hou&s;es hither, to oblige them to give the City &s;ome Relief in Corn.</P>
<P>They granted two in an hundred of their Re|venue, and it was hoped that what with this Money, and what with the Charities they drew from private Per&s;ons, they would remedy the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities: But after &s;ome time, Car|dinal <HI>Caracchioli,</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Naples,</HI> ac|quainted the Marque&s;s <HI>de les Velez,</HI> by his Vicar General, that the Pope would not &s;uffer the Tax of two in the hundred to be rai&s;ed any longer upon the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenues. Thus the Vice-Roy found him&s;elf di&s;apponited in his de&s;igns of rai&s;|ing Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which were to be laid out in Corn, and likewi&s;e a more con&s;iderable Sum that was to be &s;ent to <HI>Madrid.</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="140">
To augment the Di&s;order, which was already great enough, the price of Gold-Money dimi|ni&s;hed daily in the Dutchy of <HI>Bari,</HI> which total|ly hindred all Commerce in the greate&s;t part of the Kingdom. On the 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>December</HI> they made a Proce&s;&s;ion at <HI>Naples,</HI> which is duly per|formed every Year, to thank God for pre&s;erving this City from the Flames of the Mountain <HI>Ve&s;u|vius.</HI> The Body and Blood of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> one of the Protectors of <HI>Naples,</HI> was carried about in this Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King was troubled with an Ague for a few days towards the beginning of <HI>January</HI> 1681. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to &s;hew the a&s;&s;iduity that the young Queen made appear during the little time his Indi&s;po&s;ition la&s;ted. Two Come|dies were acted at Court to divert his Maje&s;ty after his Recovery. On one of the&s;e days, the King having prohibited all Per&s;ons, without exception, to &s;it upon the Theatre; the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI> pla|ced him&s;elf there upon a heap of Cu&s;hions, and would not depart. The King took no notice of it during the Play, but as &s;oon as it was over, he &s;ent an order to him, to come no more to Coun|cil or to Court. He was not in the lea&s;t pitied, &s;ince he had voluntarily drawn this Misfortune upon him&s;elf, and becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to mortifie him a little. But what principally occa&s;ioned the King's Severity is, that he had ob&s;erved in his Journey to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> that the Duke, who was Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the Queen, did not follow the Court thither. A little after his re|turn, he &s;ent him word, that he expected him to wait more diligently for the future: The Duke took no notice of this Advice, and as he was one of the haughtie&s;t Men in the World, affected a certain negligence in the di&s;charge of his Office, which obliged the King to acquaint him by a
<PB N="139" REF="141">
Note from the Secretary of State, that if he did not behave him&s;elf better for the time to come, he would di&s;po&s;e of his Place to &s;ome body el&s;e. He might ea&s;ily have judged from this, that the King had his Eye fixed upon him, and at lea&s;t ought to have taken care of him&s;elf for &s;ome time; but his Natural haughtine&s;s would not &s;uffer him to comply with this con&s;traint.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> did not pa&s;s all his moments with content; he was envied for the high Po&s;t he enjoyed, and <HI>d'Eguya</HI> was mortally hated: Both of them had powerful Enemies, and among&s;t the&s;e were reckoned the Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trane,</HI> and his two Brothers, the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> the Count <HI>d'Oropeza,</HI> and the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era.</HI> They frequently met toge|ther, and made &s;evere Reflections upon the unequal Conduct of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi:</HI> They ob&s;erved that he was too irre&s;olute when there was an occa&s;ion for con&s;tancy; too lazy when he ought to be diligent; and too po&s;itive, when he was ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably oppo&s;ed. They examined the pre&s;ent State of the Kingdom, the Mi&s;ery of the People, and the little appearances there were that he would redre&s;s them. They propo&s;ed Expedients to remedy all the&s;e Grievan|ces, and likewi&s;e to prevent tho&s;e that might happen; but as it was not the Publick Good a|lone that made them thus inqui&s;itive, but their Private Intere&s;t animated them, they took all of them different Mea&s;ures to attain the particu|lar ends they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves. It is true indeed, they all concurred in the de&s;truction of the Chief Mini&s;ter, but when he was removed out of the way, every one was de&s;irous to make the be&s;t Advantages for him&s;elf; and thus this narrow Spirit of Self-Intere&s;t which was &s;o pre|dominant
<PB N="140" REF="142">
in their Cabals, hindred them from uniting with that &s;incerity, that makes great Affairs &s;ucceed happily.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e Noblemen, the Admiral was mo&s;t forward to de&s;ire an Alteration: He had not forgot the &s;weetne&s;s he had ta&s;ted in that &s;hort interval, when the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valenzuela</HI> was the Queen-Mother's Favourite: The remem|brance of that Golden Time made him de&s;irous of another like it; for though he was a Per&s;on of a great E&s;tate, yet his Expences were &s;o ex|traordinary, that if he had been a great deal rich|er, he would have been always in Debt. He de&s;ired therefore to contribute what in him lay to the &s;etting up of another Mini&s;ter, in order to find his Accounts in it; not that he de&s;igned to heap up any Money, but to throw it out of the Windows and &s;quander it away, if he could but get enough to &s;erve &s;o. He carefully look'd a|bout him to find out a fit and capable Per&s;on to be advanced to this Honour; and at la&s;t, the Count <HI>d'Oropeza</HI> &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t proper to accompli&s;h his De&s;igns; for he did not doubt but that tho&s;e particular marks of E&s;teem His Maje&s;ty always &s;hewed him, would have their effect, in ca&s;e he were &s;upported by a powerful Party.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> who wanted neither Youth, Wit, nor Ambition, who&s;e whole Deportment was agreeable and Court-like, who had been concerned in the ma|nagement of &s;everal Affairs, who was laborious and vigilant, took only re&s;olute and &s;ecret Per|&s;ons into his Party. He had the ju&s;te&s;t occa&s;ions in the World to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and <HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</HI> his Mortal Enemy had done him a great deal of wrong before the King. He had painted the Acti|on
<PB N="141" REF="143">
and Character of this Count in &s;uch black co|lours, that the Young Queen de&s;igning to do him &s;ome good Offices, and &s;peaking very advantage|ou&s;ly of him to his Maje&s;ty, he told her, <HI>That</HI> Monterey <HI>might reckon him&s;elf happy enough, that he wore his Head upon his Shoulders &s;till.</HI> The Count was &s;en&s;ibly di&s;gu&s;ted to &s;ee the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> who had been Governour of <HI>Flan|ders</HI> after him, and who had even &s;erved un|der his Orders, made Coun&s;ellor of State at his arrival at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and him&s;elf con&s;equent|ly excluded after &s;o di&s;obliging a manner. Be&s;ides this he &s;aw that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> his Brother was detained at <HI>Rome</HI> again&s;t his will, although he daily petitioned to be called home. This gave the Count a new occa&s;ion to complain, and made him &s;en&s;ible of the ill di&s;po&s;itions they had at Court to his Bro|ther and him&s;elf. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> who was Beautiful and Young, threw her &s;elf frequently at the King's Feet, to demand of him the return of her Husband, who was continually indi&s;po&s;ed at <HI>Rome,</HI> whether it were becau&s;e the Air did not agree with him, or that his unea&s;ine&s;s to be kept there by force, contributed to de&s;troy his Health. What makes the ca&s;e harder, is, that &s;he did not re|que&s;t to have him come back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> but only that he might have permi&s;&s;ion to live in any of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions. The greater part of the Coun&s;ellors of State were agreed in favour of the Marchione&s;s, and her Entreaties had certainly met with &s;ucce&s;s, if the Ene|mies of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> had not taken all Opportunities to confirm the King in the Opinion he had already of him, that he was a Man of the mo&s;t incureable ill Temper in the World, and that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him
<PB N="142" REF="144">
to permit him to come home, without ha|zarding the Peace of all the Court. We may therefore ea&s;ily apprehend, that the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> had rea&s;on enough to be angry with the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> and <HI>d'Eguya</HI>; and his Re&s;entments as well as his Ambition made him pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h to &s;ee another in the Place, that he might effectually Revenge him|&s;elf upon the Duke, whom he hated, and might have acce&s;s enough to the new Favou|rite, to be able through his means to be in|troduced into the Council of State, and pu&s;h on his own Fortune. He imagined him&s;elf capable of doing it by his Merits and good Management: But although he might with Ju&s;tice a&s;pire to the mo&s;t high and difficult Po&s;ts, he was obliged to conceal his De&s;ires and Intentions; becau&s;e he found People's Eyes were &s;till upon him, and that &s;everal who made a &s;olemn Profe&s;&s;ion to be his Friends, &s;erved only as &s;o many Spies to watch him. This con&s;ideration prevailed with him to put that re&s;traint upon him&s;elf, as to live in a &s;ort of Retirement, and that with &s;o much circum|&s;pection, as to di&s;cover his De&s;igns almo&s;t to no body. Nay, he affected to vi&s;it the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and having found him one day more ea&s;ie of Acce&s;s than was u&s;ual with him, he freely declared to him, that it was not without the greate&s;t Impatience that he beheld the preference the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> met with, to be made Privy-Coun&s;ellor, and him|&s;elf excluded. The Duke an&s;wered him, that he might expect his turn one day, and upon this &s;hewed him &s;ome Civility, which per&s;wa|ded the Count to believe, that he had now perhaps a greater kindne&s;s for him than for|merly. This Rea&s;on engaged him to make his
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Court regularly to him, and to devote him&s;elf to him, at lea&s;t in appearance.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Veraguas,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the Af|front he had received in lo&s;ing the Vice-Roy|&s;hip of <HI>Valencia,</HI> had no other Motive to in|duce him to think of the removal of the Chief Mini&s;ter, but only an expectation that he who &s;ucceded him in that Place, would do him more Ju&s;tice, than the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> had done: For although the Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> was de&s;cended of an illu&s;trious Family, as being of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and that be&s;ides his Youth, he had a great deal of Merit and Ca|pacity; yet whatever Importunities he made at Court to be re&s;tored to his Vice-Roy&s;hip again, he was not able to obtain it. He had received Ab&s;olution privately from the Apo|&s;tolick <HI>Nuncio,</HI> for having ordered the Monk to be executed, who had quitted his Habit, and was made Captain of the <HI>Banditti.</HI> It was be|lieved, that having now appea&s;ed the Pope, this would facilitate his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment: He daily pre&s;ented his Petitions to the Council; he demanded of them, that if he were a Cri|minal, they would treat him as &s;uch, that his Tryal might come one, and that his Head might an&s;wer for the Faults he had committed; but that if after &s;trict Examination of his Conduct, they found he had &s;erved His Maje&s;ty well, they would not deny him the Ju&s;tice that is al|lowed to the meane&s;t Soldier. His Trouble and his Reque&s;ts were always equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, he found them perver&s;e and prejudiced again&s;t him; and &s;o by this ill u&s;age they obliged him to join with the Male contents.</P>
<P>As for the Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trane,</HI> he had not in the lea&s;t been ill u&s;ed at Court, however he thought it &s;ufficient ill Treatment to be left with|out
<PB N="144" REF="146">
an Employ. His Wife, who was Si&s;ter to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> and the Count <HI>de Mon|tery,</HI> being provoked at what Indignities tho&s;e of her Family had &s;uffered, per&s;waded him to u&s;e all his Efforts to get a new Mini&s;tery e|&s;tabli&s;hed. The Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trane</HI> voluntarily e&s;pou&s;ed this Party, and his two Brothers, whom he had made acquainted with the De|&s;ign, were re&s;olved not to &s;eparate their In|tere&s;ts from his: One of them was named <HI>Don Ga&s;per,</HI> the other <HI>Don Jo&s;eph de Sylva</HI>; the la&s;t of the&s;e had a very great &s;hare in the King's Affections, and his Place of Chief Gen|tleman-U&s;her procured him a great E&s;teem and Approbation. He had Married the Daugh|ter of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era</HI>; but the&s;e three Noblemen were guilty of a great Sole|ci&s;m in this Affair: For they communicated the matter to <HI>Don Seba&s;tian Bibanco,</HI> Secretary of the Chamber, out of a Pre&s;umption that he was of the &s;ame Opinion with them&s;elves, but herein they were mi&s;taken; for he was infinitely more devoted to the Chief Mini&s;ter than to them, and con&s;equently no &s;ooner knew any thing of Importance, but he immediate|ly di&s;covered it to him.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era,</HI> Grand Ma&s;ter of the Queen-Mother's Hou&s;hold, and her Crea|ture, de&s;ired for her &s;ake as well as his own, to &s;ee the Government molded into another Form. He was a Man well advanced in Years, who&s;e Merit and Experience might with Ju|&s;tice prompt him to believe that he was fit to po&s;&s;e&s;s whatever Place they would a&s;&s;ign him in the Mini&s;tery. He de&s;ired a <HI>Juncto</HI> to be erected, that he might be cho&s;en a Member of it: But knowing that his Zeal for the Queen-Mother rendred him &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected, and
<PB N="145" REF="147">
that he ran an extraordinary hazard if he ap|peared for him&s;elf, he judged it expedient to employ the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> who was his Brother-in Law and Confident. So he di&s;cour&s;|ed him about the matter, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with a de&s;ire to take all nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to effect it. The other having nothing to fear by rea&s;on of his Quality of being Amba&s;&s;ador, laboured very diligently in the Affair, while the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era</HI> expre&s;&s;ed but a &s;mall concern for whatever happened at Court, un|le&s;s it were for the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana</HI>'s Endea|vours to contribute to his Advancement. He &s;eemed to be of Opinion, that for the Intere&s;ts of the Emperour his Ma&s;ter, he was obliged to procure the Pro&s;perity of <HI>Spain,</HI> which langui&s;h|ed under an extreme Mi&s;ery that extended it &s;elf farther than the Limits of that Kingdom: That it was impo&s;&s;ible for the King to Second the Emperour in any of his De&s;igns, as long as the Members of that great Body were declining, and continued under the ill effects of a Con&s;um|ption, that made them utterly incapable of Acti|on; that it was to no purpo&s;e to make any Pro|po&s;als to the Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e whatever they promi&s;ed him was never executed. All the&s;e Motives joyned together, excited him to make all po&s;&s;ible advances to convince the Duke of the Nece&s;&s;ity he lay under to erect a <HI>Juncto.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this he con&s;idered that the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era</HI> wou'd not fail of making one of that number; that he would manage him&s;elf in the Council according to the Directions he gave him, and that this would be the ea&s;ie&s;t way for him to &s;ucceed in all his Enterprizes. He ima|gin'd, that the be&s;t Policy he could u&s;e to accom|pli&s;h the&s;e De&s;igns, would be to u&s;e none it all, and &s;o he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf immediately
<PB N="146" REF="148">
to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI> He began with commending his Zeal, his Indu&s;try and Pains, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ing into a more &s;trict Exami|nation of every thing, he was de&s;irous to make him comprehend, <HI>That the Affairs of this Monarchy were reduced to their la&s;t Period, unle&s;s he took &s;ure and ready Methods to remedy them; that he made a Slave of him&s;elf in vain, &s;ince it was not po&s;&s;ible for one &s;ingle Man to &s;u&s;tain (like another</HI> Atlas<HI>) the weight of &s;o many Kingdoms; that</HI> Don Louis de Haro <HI>at a conjuncture of le&s;s difficulty, had compo&s;ed a Juncto for his own ea&s;e, and here|in followed the Example of &s;everal great Mini&s;ters who preceded him; that a Juncto would &s;erve to determine Matters under the Authority of the Chief Mini&s;ter, to whom they would carry every thing almo&s;t dige&s;ted in his Hand, and that by this means, bu&s;ine&s;s would go on cheerfully and &s;peedi|ly; that at the pre&s;ent time, whatever good Re&s;o|lutions were taken, yet they continued without effect, by rea&s;on of the general Perplexity, which rendred tho&s;e things difficult that appeared to be very ea&s;ie; that he ought to con&s;ider, that the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Genius in the World, without great Pre&s;umption, could never promi&s;e him&s;elf to move &s;o ponderous a Machine all alone, and that be therefore coun&s;elled him to take &s;ome Se|conds, of Experience and Ability &s;ufficient, to make him repo&s;e one part of his Affairs upon them.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief Mini&s;ter reli&s;hed the&s;e Rea&s;ons of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grana,</HI> promi&s;ing to weigh the matter with Deliberation, and afterwards, if he &s;aw good, to determine him&s;elf by the Advice he had given him. This gave the Amba&s;&s;ador good hopes, that his Vi&s;it would meet with hap+py &s;ucce&s;s; and as he was a Per&s;on of a great deal of Wit, who knew how to &s;et off any thing
<PB N="147" REF="149">
to the be&s;t advantage, and &s;how it by the be&s;t Lights, &s;o he did not que&s;tion but the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> would lay hold of the Expedient, he had di&s;covered to him: But the Chief Mini|&s;ter had the weakne&s;s to di&s;cour&s;e <HI>d'Eguya</HI> about them; who did not lo&s;e one moment to di&s;|&s;wade him from this Re&s;olution. <HI>He repre&s;ented to him, that if he compo&s;ed a Juncto, he went to give him&s;elf &s;o many Tutors; that then he could de|cide nothing but in concert with them; that he would find him&s;elf joyned with Noblemen, who were led by their own Pa&s;&s;ions, blinded with their own Intere&s;ts, &s;till pur&s;uing their own Ends, and turning every matter to their own private advan|tage; that notwith&s;tanding all this, he only mu&s;t re&s;olve to bear the brunt of all, and that every body having their Eyes fixed upon him would pur&s;ue all his Motions &s;tep by &s;tep; that if any difficult juncture, any misfortune, or unexpected accident &s;hould happen, he alone mu&s;t incur the Reproach of it; that the Juncto would never be called in que&s;tion for ill Events, but that they would all lye at the Chief Mini&s;ter's door; that it was very ju&s;t and natural to think, that if he alone was re&s;pon|&s;ible for all Mi&s;carriages, that then he alone de|&s;erved to enjoy the Grandeur and Advantages that are annexed to this Place.</HI> He turned the Duke's Inclinations &s;o happily by the&s;e Rea&s;ons, that he re&s;olved to follow them, notwith&s;tanding the advice that was given him to the contrary; &s;o that when the Marque&s;s came to him with Ex|pectations to find him continue &s;till in the &s;ame Sentiments, and ready to put them in Execution, he perceived that he was &s;tedfa&s;t and inflexible in the other Opinion, and that all the Avenues to him were &s;hut up and hindred.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Lords who had a&s;&s;ociated together, to make a League again&s;t the Duke,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
continued to a&s;&s;emble in private, and to debate of the Expedients that were to be taken to con|vince the King of the nece&s;&s;ity there was to chu&s;e another Mini&s;ter, or at lea&s;t to erect a Juncto; but the greate&s;t part of their time was generally &s;pent in making long Politick Di&s;cour&s;es, and the&s;e &s;ame Politicks hindred them &s;o, that none of them offered to put him&s;elf at the head of the Party. When the Que&s;tion was about &s;etting up a Chief, every one &s;tood looking upon his Neighbour; they wanted that Amity and Confi|dence in one another, which is nece&s;&s;ary to cement the&s;e De&s;igns; and he that merited the greate&s;t e&s;teem, was &s;ure to find the lea&s;t Friend&s;hip from the re&s;t. Envy reigned among&s;t them, Sincerity was not ob&s;erved; and when their Society was examined, there was nothing but Vanity and Weakne&s;s to be found at the bottom.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e who were mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the ill management that was to be found in this Ca|bal, the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was one of the fir&s;t. He ea&s;ily di&s;covered all the defects of the Party, and found it was non&s;ence to be longer engaged in it; &s;ince the Bow was not drawn high enough to &s;end the Arrow to the Butt. He was a&s;&s;ured, that the de&s;ign would be di&s;covered, and that then he &s;hould find him&s;elf very finely ruined; that &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;ucceeded, and a Juncto was &s;et up, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> would in all probability be made a Member of it, and for his part, rather than that &s;hould happen, he would chu&s;e to go to Hell, becau&s;e he bore &s;uch an implacable ha|tred to him. This only <HI>Idea,</HI> that now he con|tributed to procure an Advantage for the Mar|que&s;s, turned his Inclinations ab&s;olutely from the Society into which he was entred: In fine, after abundance of Reflections he totally abandoned it, and &s;everal People were &s;trongly per&s;waded that
<PB N="149" REF="151">
he was not content to quit it, but that he went to the King, and acquainted him with the mo&s;t minute Particulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed there; nay, that he gave the &s;ame Advice to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Victm the Duke &s;acrificed to his Re|&s;entments, was the Count <HI>de Montery,</HI> whether it were becau&s;e his Indignation were the more violent again&s;t him, by rea&s;on of the Friend&s;hip he always pretended to him, and now had viola|ted; or becau&s;e he feared him more than any of the re&s;t: So that notwith&s;tanding the great &s;ecu|rity he imagined him&s;elf to be in for his circum|&s;pect Conduct, the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> &s;ent him word, that he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him, and therefore mu&s;t &s;ee him that Evening at Court, (for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved by the way, that the Pre&s;i|dents of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> never go to make any Vi&s;its.) The Count was very glad to have this Opportuni|ty to di&s;cour&s;e him, having &s;ome Affairs to &s;peak with him about, wherein he was concerned. But his Joy la&s;ted but a &s;hort time, for the Pre&s;ident gave him an Order contained in a Billet from the King, and &s;igned by <HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya,</HI> wherein it was &s;pecified, that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly retire to one of his Country-Hou&s;es. He conti|nued &s;urpri&s;ed for &s;ome time, and told the Pre|&s;ident, he was ready to obey it; but that being a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> he demanded an Order &s;igned by the King's own Hand, &s;ince it was the Cu&s;tom, and that while he tarried for it, he would go to put his Affairs in order. In &s;hort, he returned to his own Hou&s;e extremely concerned, and got his Equipage made ready, not at all doubting but that the Order would be &s;ent &s;uddenly to him. He received it next day, which was the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> accompanied with a Permi&s;&s;i|on to tarry three days longer in <HI>Madrid.</HI> He
<PB N="150" REF="152">
pa&s;&s;ed them there among&s;t &s;ome of his Friends, and afterwards parted for <HI>Salamanca.</HI> Few Peo|ple pitied his ca&s;e, becau&s;e he was generally envied; and when Fortune leaves a Man, few of his Friends have Genero&s;ity enough to declare them&s;elves in favour of him, or to e&s;pou&s;e his Cau&s;e. He was the fir&s;t Per&s;on whom the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> treated ill, and 'tis believed he had not made him &s;erve as an Example for the re&s;t, if <HI>d'Eguya</HI> by his violent Cour&s;es had not &s;owred that peaceable and &s;weet Di&s;po&s;ition that was &s;o natural to the Chief Mini&s;ter; for he ad|vi&s;ed him to puni&s;h the Count immediately, to be a warning to others; and he was bani&s;hed ra|ther becau&s;e he was not agreeable to <HI>d'Eguya,</HI> and had too much Merit, than becau&s;e he was an Enemy to the Duke. The Queen-Mother &s;e|cretly rejoyced at it, but could not &s;o well con|ceal her &s;atisfaction, but that it was evidently perceived. The Count had quitted her Party in <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s time, and 'tis very well known, that he had &s;everal pre&s;&s;ing Obligations upon him to have u&s;ed her after another manner; for if he had been willing to have made the be&s;t advan|tage of his Fortune, &s;he had preferred him to <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> and intru&s;ted him with the manage|ment of her Affairs. He had at lea&s;t as many good Qualities as the other could pretend to, and was of an illu&s;trious Extraction, but being a young Man he neglected the advances the Queen-Mother made towards him. A certain Per&s;on, who knew the whole Proceedings very well, told me that Father <HI>Nitard</HI> was &s;carce gone out of <HI>Spain,</HI> when &s;he began to ca&s;t her Eyes upon him, intending to honour him with her Confidence. On the Fe&s;tival of St. <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> who is the Patron of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and on which day a Bull-fea&s;t was cele|brated at the Expence of the City, the Queen-Mother
<PB N="151" REF="153">
asked the Count, whether he de&s;igned to Combat the Bulls; he told her no, unle&s;s her Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to order him. <HI>No,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I will by no means Command you to do it, but is there ne'r a Lady here in Court, who has laid any &s;uch Commands upon you? If any of them had,</HI> replied he, <HI>your Maje&s;ty might well imagine, that I would not fail to give her this mark of my Obedience.</HI> The Queen cried out Je&s;us, Je&s;us, Count! Will you expo&s;e your Life thus? A few days after this, &s;he let a Paper drop out of her Hands, as he was giving her an account of &s;ome Affairs &s;he had intru&s;t|ed him with; he took it up, and kneeling up|on one Knee, pre&s;ented it to her. <HI>Perhaps,</HI> &s;ays the Queen, <HI>you believe it is a Paper of Importance, come I'll leave you to judge of that your &s;elf, open it.</HI> The Count found the follow|ing words there.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;toy toda la noche de&s;pierta &s;ola, tri&s;te, y de|&s;eando: Mis penas &s;on Martirios, mis Martiri|os &s;on gu&s;tos.</HI> That is to &s;ay, <HI>I pa&s;s all the Night without &s;leeping, alone, pen&s;ive, and forming de|&s;ires to my &s;elf: My Pain is a Martyrdom, but my Martyrdom is a Plea&s;ure.</HI> The Count read the&s;e Words with &s;o carele&s;s an Air, that the Queen who ob&s;erved it, &s;natched the Paper out of his Hand, and &s;aid to him, go you in&s;en&s;i|ble, and &s;ay your <HI>Domine non &s;um dignus.</HI> The Count was &s;en&s;ible of his Fault, and endea|voured to repair it, but it &s;ucceeded a great deal wor&s;e with him. The Queen-Mother did not doubt but that he had &s;ome other Engage|ment which he preferred to his Fortune; &s;he informed her &s;elf of his Conduct, and at la&s;t knew that he was de&s;perately in love with the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Monteleon.</HI> This was a young Widow, Beautiful and agreeable, but the
<PB N="152" REF="154">
Queen prohibited her to come to Court. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> her Mother, was ex|tremely di&s;gu&s;ted at it, and this was the oc|ca&s;ion why &s;he di&s;engaged her &s;elf from the Intere&s;ts of the Queen-Mother, and joyned with <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s Faction. In the mean time the Queen continued &s;till enraged at the Procedure of the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI>; &s;o that pa&s;&s;ing from the Extremity of Love to that of Ha|tred, &s;he gave him during the remainder of her Regency, all the Mortifications &s;he could think of.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t People were di&s;plea&s;ed with the Admi|ral of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and call'd him nothing but fal&s;e Brother, and fal&s;e Friend. Neverthele&s;s he would have it received for a certain Truth, that he never had any Intention to make the lea&s;t Di&s;coveries; but that the King having &s;ent for him, told him, that upon condition he would deal fairly and hone&s;tly by him, he would forgive him: Whereas on the contrary, if he went about to excu&s;e him&s;elf, he was certainly undone; that he knew every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, even to the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance, that the Declaration he demanded of him was rather to know his Heart, than to draw any new Lights from him; that when he would have denied every thing, the King pre&s;&s;ed him more earne&s;tly than before: So that upon that Score, he re&s;olved to di&s;cover what related per|&s;onally to him&s;elf, but that he had avoided as much as was po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak of his Friends. To &s;ay the Truth, whether he really excu&s;ed the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> or the Court looked upon him to have made but an incon&s;iderable Fi|gure among&s;t the Party, the Chief Mini&s;ter did not make him feel the Effects of his Indi|gnation. It is indeed as certain, that his Pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="153" REF="155">
preceded his Fault, and that having already lo&s;t his Place of being Pre&s;ident of the Council of <HI>Planders,</HI> which was be&s;towed upon the Count <HI>de Monterey,</HI> he had &s;ome Ju&s;tice on his &s;ide to expect that they would &s;uffer him to live in quiet.</P>
<P>The Bani&s;hment of the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> &s;o terribly affrighted the Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trane</HI> his Brother-in-Law, that he thought of nothing el&s;e but how to get hand&s;omly out of the In|trigue: He followed the Admiral's Steps, that is to &s;ay, he readily di&s;covered whatever he knew of this affair, that he might better per|&s;wade the King of his Sincerity and Repen|tance. Secretary <HI>Vibanco,</HI> to whom he opened him&s;elf, had already di&s;covered the whole Con|trivance; but in fine, he came &s;oon enough to be favourably received: His two Brothers, who were concerned in the &s;ame Cabal, imitated his Example, in reconciling them&s;elves to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and they &s;eemed in all appea|rance to embrace his Intere&s;ts, with greater Zeal than any of his be&s;t and olde&s;t Friends. Neverthele&s;s, the Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trane</HI> and his two Brothers could not forbear to be a lit|tle troubled, for being looked upon by the World as timerous Per&s;ons, who had only made the&s;e di&s;coveries out of Weakne&s;s and Irre&s;olution: This Rea&s;on obliged them to u&s;e all imaginable means to make it be believed that they had told the King nothing; but that having had the Misfortune to communicate their De&s;igns to <HI>Vibanco,</HI> he had Sacrificed his Friend&s;hip to make his Court at their Ex|pence; that the King had him ready to pro|duce as a Witne&s;s again&s;t them; that he had &s;everely threatned them, and affixed their Par|don only to their Sincerity; that they could
<PB N="154" REF="156">
not po&s;&s;ibly avoid the doing of this at a Jun|cture, when they &s;hould otherwi&s;e have de&s;troy|ed them&s;elves without &s;aving any Body el&s;e; and that if it had not been for the&s;e unhappy Circum&s;tances, they had never been capable of doing this Injury to their Friends. People hearkned to them, but gave no Credit to their words; nay, &s;everal of their Friends reproach|ed them very frankly for &s;hewing &s;o little Cou|rage and Con&s;tancy upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> had e&s;caped as well as the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> and the lo&s;s of his Vice-Roy&s;hip had prevented the Puni&s;h|ment they pretended he de&s;erved, for join|ing him&s;elf to a Party again&s;t the Chief Mi|ni&s;ter: But he was impatient to be re&s;tored to his former Dignity, and continually demanded Ju&s;tice at their Hands; he filled all his Peti|tions with Complaints, and loudly vented them again&s;t the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI>; be&s;ides this, he earne&s;tly importun'd the King to a&s;&s;ign him &s;ome Judges; before whom he might Ju&s;ti|fie his Conduct in condemning the relap&s;ed Monk, who had betaken him&s;elf to the <HI>Ban|ditti.</HI> So at la&s;t he was &s;ent to the Council of <HI>Arragon,</HI> where he demanded to be re e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, as a piece of Ju&s;tice that could not be de|nied him, and pur&s;ued this Affair with all po&s;|&s;ible Vigour and Heat: But on the third of <HI>February</HI> he received an Order to withdraw pre&s;ently to his E&s;tate in <HI>Andaluzia.</HI> He beg|ged leave to go to any other place, becau&s;e the Plague raged violently in that Province; but it was refu&s;ed him, and he had only eight Hours to prepare for his Departure. One may &s;ay, it was only the ill Fortune of the Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> that procured him all the ill u&s;age he met upon the account of his Vice-Roy&s;hip:
<PB N="155" REF="157">
For it is a certain truth, that if there were a Law to treat all People after the &s;ame manner, who fail in their Duty; abundance of Per&s;ons had been &s;everely puni&s;hed, who were now gratified and encouraged for their Pains: But His Maje&s;ty was &s;o exceedingly prejudiced a|gain&s;t him, that one Evening when the Queen was demanding of him, whether it were true, that the Duke <HI>de Veraguas</HI> was Bani&s;hed: He an&s;wered, <HI>Yes, and that all tho&s;e &s;hould be treated in the &s;ame kind who talked impertinently.</HI> This was &s;ufficient to make the Queen know how his Inclinations &s;tood, and as &s;he was very pru|dent, &s;he took care to change the Di&s;cour&s;e im|mediately.</P>
<P>It was now &s;en&s;ibly perceived at Court, that the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and <HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</HI> oppo&s;ed the Queen-Mother in every thing, but the true Occa&s;ion was not po&s;itive|ly known. One day when the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Mortare</HI> came to Vi&s;it us, we &s;poke to her concerning it; and as &s;he was particularly in|formed of the whole matter, and repo&s;ed a greater Confidence in us than in the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> becau&s;e we had no Intere&s;ts to take, in this Affair: She acquainted us, That &s;ome time before the King went to the <HI>E&s;curial, d'Eguya</HI> going to find out the Queen-Mother, to &s;hew her a certain Letter which the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Rome,</HI> had &s;ent to the King: When he was come into her Clo&s;et, looked for it in his Letter Bag to no purpo&s;e. He then re|membred him&s;elf, that he had locked it up in his <HI>Scritore,</HI> where he had &s;everal other Pa|pers, which he had no mind any body &s;hould &s;ee; and &s;ent a little Page for it, who could not read. The poor Boy took the fir&s;t Letter he found there, and wrapped it up in a Sheet of
<PB N="156" REF="158">
white Paper, as he had every day &s;een his Ma|&s;ter do the &s;ame, when he carried his Expedi|tions to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</HI> tarried all this while with the Queen-Mother, and as &s;oon as the Boy brought him the Letter, without taking it out of the Paper, delivered it to her. It was now towards Evening, and the Queen went to the Window to read it more conveniently: She was immediately &s;urprized to find it was not Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI>'s Hand, but that of <HI>Don|na Lucinda Bucados</HI> (who was of the Hou&s;e <HI>de Barcelona</HI>) one of her Maids of Honour, who was a very Beautiful Lady, and extremely lo|ved by <HI>d'Eguya.</HI> The Letter was writ with a great deal of Freedom, and &s;ignified to him, that he had no rea&s;on to apprehend that the Queen her Mi&s;tre&s;s would cen&s;ure their Amours. She gave him &s;everal Rea&s;ons for it, that highly reflected on the Queen's Reputation. After &s;he had read it over, &s;he impo&s;ed that con&s;traint up|on her &s;elf, as to conceal her Indignation for that time, and only told <HI>d'Eguya,</HI> that &s;he mu&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e the King about what the Amba&s;&s;ador had written to him. As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he &s;ent for <HI>Donna Lucinda,</HI> and after &s;he had reproached her for her Ingratitude and Impu|dence, &s;he cau&s;ed her to be privately locked up in a little Chamber well grated and barr'd up, and kept the Key of it her &s;elf. Here the un|fortunate <HI>Lucinda</HI> was forced to lye upon a &s;orry Matt, having nothing but Bread and Wa|ter to &s;u&s;tain her, and the Queen-Mother fre|quently ordered her to undergo the Penance of a Di&s;cipline. They told tho&s;e that enquired after her, that &s;he was &s;ick of the Small-Pox, that the Queen had ordered her to be remov'd out of the Palace, and that &s;he was dangerou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159">
<HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</HI> believ'd the News, and was almo&s;t de&s;perate for two days; but having open'd his <HI>Scritore,</HI> to take out &s;omething or other, he was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed to find the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI>'s Letter there, which he thought he had left in the Hands of the Queen-Mother: He &s;earch'd immediately for that of <HI>Donna Lucinda,</HI> and not finding it, he &s;oon concluded where the fatal Error was commit|mitted; &s;o he ran in all ha&s;te to the Queen-Mother's Apartment, ca&s;t him&s;elf at her Feet, conjur'd her to forgive <HI>Lucinda,</HI> to con&s;ider her Youth, her Birth, and the humble tender Intreaties he made in her behalf; but he found the Queen Inflexible. Seeing at la&s;t that he was not able to move her, he told her he knew a way how to revenge him&s;elf upon her. She asked him what it was? He replied, that he would hinder <HI>Valenzuela</HI> from ever coming back again; and that &s;he &s;hould behold him no more. The Queen very much enrag'd at this An&s;wer, told him, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible enough of the Ill-will he bore her, but that &s;he did not fear the Effects of it; that it was a long time &s;ince &s;he had lo&s;t <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> who was indeed one of the be&s;t Servants &s;he ever had, but that &s;he was now accu&s;tomed to bear his Ab&s;ence. Af|terwards &s;he added the&s;e words, looking earne&s;t|ly upon him, <HI>I would advi&s;e you for your own &s;ake to hinder his Return, for if ever he comes to know that &s;uch a Fellow as you had the bold|ne&s;s to di&s;plea&s;e me, he would tear you in pieces as a Lion does a She-Goat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>D'Eguya</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Rage, took the fir&s;t favourable Opportunity to &s;peak to the King in prejudice of <HI>Valenzuela</HI>; <HI>He repre&s;ented to him, That he was a bold intriguing Man; that if the Queen had him with her, they two would</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="160">
<HI>rai&s;e Factions together, in which they would engage all the turbulent Spirits in the Kingdom; that by this means they would di&s;turb the Tranquillity he now enjoyed; that the Queen &s;till regretted the Time and Authority of the Regency; that it was dangerous to &s;hew Favours to any of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who had been her Creatures of old.</HI> In a word, he &s;o well managed the King upon this occa&s;i|on, that he bid him i&s;&s;ue out an Order, &s;uch as he judged convenient, to hinder the coming back of the unfortunate <HI>Valenzuela. D'Eguya</HI> lo&s;t no time about it, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the Or|der was, That if they met him upon the Sea, in his Return to <HI>Spain,</HI> they &s;hould take him out of the Ve&s;&s;el where he was, and re-em|bark him in that which brought the Order, and &s;o carry him to <HI>Cartagena</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The Queen-Mother for her part &s;ent away <HI>Donna Lucinda</HI> in private, with Orders to Ship her at the <HI>Groyn,</HI> and to Tran&s;port her to <HI>Flanders,</HI> where &s;he had &s;ent word to Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Parma,</HI> to get her &s;hut up in a Nunnery. But <HI>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</HI> having found means to acquaint him&s;elf of what had happened, di&s;patched an Order of the Chief Mini&s;ter to the <HI>Groyne,</HI> to bring <HI>Donna Lucinda</HI> back to one of her Relations, who had agreed to take care of her.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>d'Eguya</HI>'s &s;ide in this Di&s;pute with a mighty heat. The Affair blew over at Court without any noi&s;e or bu&s;tle: As for the Queen-Mother, &s;he &s;poke nothing at all of it; becau&s;e it had then been nece&s;&s;ary to produce <HI>Lucinda</HI>'s Letter, which was by no means convenient to be &s;hewn, for the &s;everal fierce and di&s;re&s;pectful things con|tained in it. On the other hand, <HI>d'Eguya</HI> had no Temptation to &s;peak of it; for being Se|cretary
<PB N="159" REF="161">
of State, and under an Obligation to pre&s;erve his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity, he was not wil|ling to di&s;cover his Amorous Weakne&s;&s;es to the World.</P>
<P><HI>D'Eguya,</HI> who was the &s;ole cau&s;e of the ill under&s;tanding between the Queen-Mother and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> u&s;ed all his Endea|vours to encrea&s;e it &s;till, and in order to ac|compli&s;h his de&s;igns, alarm'd the Duke perpe|tually with all that he had rea&s;on to apprehend from the Re&s;entments and Indignation of that Prince&s;s. What he whi&s;pered to him, &s;erved to exa&s;perate the Chief Mini&s;ter more and more again&s;t her, and this made him keep a fair Corre&s;pondence with her no longer. He con&s;idered with him&s;elf, that he &s;tood firm in the King's Affection, and that the Father Con|fe&s;&s;or and <HI>d'Eguya,</HI> who had more frequent oc|ca&s;ions to di&s;cour&s;e his Maje&s;ty than he had, would take care to confirm him in all the fa|vourable Di&s;po&s;itions he had for the Duke. This Triumvirate began at the &s;ame time to &s;ow the Seeds of Di&s;cord between the King and the Queen-Mother. No body dur&s;t ac|quaint the King with the Rea&s;ons that inclined them to act &s;o violently; they had &s;een after what manner the Chief Mini&s;ter had treated tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were not of his &s;ide, and they had no Mind to draw down his Anger upon them&s;elves. The great Officers belonging to the King's Hou&s;hold &s;eemed to depend en|tirely upon him; the Gentlemen of the Cham|ber, who waited every day in their turn, pay'd no le&s;s abject Submi&s;&s;ion to the Favourite; and tho&s;e who had Sincerity enough to &s;peak, con&s;i|dering the Injury they might hereby do them&s;elves, left the Province of better informing the King to &s;ome body el&s;e, who had more Zeal,
<PB N="160" REF="162">
and le&s;s Policy: So that the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi, d'Eguya,</HI> and the Confe&s;&s;or, finding a clear Field, gave his Maje&s;ty what Ill Impre&s;&s;ions they plea&s;ed, in relation to the Queen-Mother; they a&s;&s;ured him that nothing in the World could make her forget the Troubles and ill u&s;age &s;he had found when <HI>Don Juan</HI> governed all; that although &s;he had rea&s;on enough to believe, that when that Mini&s;ter treated her &s;o rudely, he acted only by him&s;elf; yet it was certainly true, that all was done under the Name and Autho|rity of the King; that therefore &s;he would always remember, it was he that abetted the Per&s;ecu|tion &s;he had &s;uffered; and that he ought to con&s;ider, that it was by no means &s;afe to re|po&s;e any Confidence in a reconciled Enemy. The natural goodne&s;s of the King, and the Re&s;pect he had for the Queen his Mother, hin|dered him from being ab&s;olutely influenced by the pernicious Coun&s;els they gave him; how|ever they prevailed &s;o far upon him as to ren|der him jealous, and con&s;equently cold and re&s;erved to her. She ea&s;ily perceived it, and was well informed of all their De&s;igns, but whether &s;he judged it was by no means a pro|per time to endeavour the De&s;truction of her Enemies, or whether &s;he had &s;ome other rea&s;ons to di&s;&s;wade her from attempting it; &s;he did not move at all in that Affair, and a &s;hort time af|ter, &s;he never went out of her Palace, but only to make Vi&s;its of common decency to the King and Queen.</P>
<P>The Chief Mini&s;ter, the Father Confe&s;&s;or and <HI>d'Eguya</HI> applauded one another for having removed the Queen-Mother from all &s;hare in the Admini&s;tration of Affairs, but fearing left the young Queen might become &s;erviceable to her in this conjecture, they found it conveni
<PB N="161" REF="163">
ent to render the Queen-Mother &s;u&s;pected to her. They took a very odd way to effect it, but one that &s;erved their turn as well as a|ny; that is to &s;ay, they began to in&s;pire the King with a di&s;like of the Queen's Conduct, wherein they made him ob&s;erve abundance of incon&s;iderable &s;light things, which they inter|preted to him with &s;o much the more Mali|gnity, becau&s;e the Queen acting without any re&s;erve as all Per&s;ons of Sincerity u&s;e to do, never re&s;trained her own natural Temper.</P>
<P>Sometimes the King expre&s;&s;ed to her &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction at it, and this afflicted her ex|tremely, but while &s;he looked about her to find out who tho&s;e Per&s;ons were that did her the&s;e ill Offices, &s;ome of the Duke's Confi|dents gave her to under&s;tand that all this came from the Queen-Mother, who &s;eeing &s;he had no Children, endeavoured to render the King indifferent to her, that &s;o &s;he might arrive to what &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, which was to &s;ee the Arch-Dutche&s;s Queen of <HI>Spain.</HI> The young Queen found &s;ome appearances of truth in what they told her, and this threw her in|to a dejection of Mind, that really made her an object of Compa&s;&s;ion. Another Affliction was joyned to this, and contributed to au|gment her Grief, and that was to &s;ee the lit|tle Credit &s;he had to obtain whatever &s;he de&s;i|red.</P>
<P>For although the Chief Mini&s;ter had pro|mi&s;ed to be always devoted to her Service, and &s;he had accepted of the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquerque</HI> chiefly upon his Recommendation; yet he &s;eemed not at all to be &s;en&s;ible of it, and ne|ver obliged her in any tolerable Manner. It was to no purpo&s;e that &s;he begged any favour of the King, and it was to as little purpo&s;e
<PB N="162" REF="164">

The Queen, who had a great deal of Wit and Penetration, and who knew what Ob&s;tacles the Chief Mini&s;ter always laid in her way, could not forbear to &s;peak to the King about him, in a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing earne&s;t manner, which intimated to him his unaccount|able fondne&s;s for the Chief Mini&s;ter; and &s;ome|times &s;he clo&s;ed the Di&s;cou&s;e with a particular detail of the Di&s;orders which were to be found in all Affairs, by rea&s;on of the Duke's in&s;uffer|able Negligence. The King gave <HI>d'Eguya</HI> an Account of what the Queen told him, <HI>d'Eguya</HI> carried all to the Duke to make his Court by it, and this &s;till occa&s;ioned fre&s;h Complaints on one &s;ide and t'other. The young Queen by this means compleatly lo&s;t that little Intere&s;t &s;he had in the Chief Mini|&s;ter, and &s;ometimes could not tell what mea|&s;ures &s;he ought to take, to &s;trengthen and &s;up|port her own Authority.</P>
<P>The Queen was con&s;idering with her &s;elf, what the Occa&s;ion might be that made the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> neglect to give her that deference he was obliged to pay her for &s;o ma|ny Rea&s;ons; and the Duke being informed that the Queen's Re&s;entments again&s;t him daily increa&s;ed, made u&s;e of the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;tor+gas</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;or, to tell him who belonged to the Queen, that her Maje&s;ty made a wrong Judgment of his Inclinations; that he &s;hould always be ready to give her all imaginable Te+&s;timonies of his Re&s;pect and Fidelity, but tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

it was an ungrateful di&s;plea&s;ing &s;ight to him to &s;ee her Maje&s;ty &s;hew &s;uch particular Favours to Per&s;ons directly oppo&s;ite to him, among&s;t whom he reckoned the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> the Counte&s;s <HI>de Monterey,</HI> the Prince&s;s <HI>de Stilla|no,</HI> the Dutche&s;s <HI>de O&s;&s;one,</HI> the Marchione&s;s <HI>de los Velez,</HI> the Dutche&s;s <HI>de l'Infantado,</HI> and &s;ome others: That if &s;he would be plea&s;ed to remove tho&s;e Ladies, or at lea&s;t not entertain them with &s;uch evident di&s;tinctions of Kindne&s;s, he &s;hould receive it with a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible acknow|ledgment, and omit no opportunity to give her all the proofs of Gratitude he was capable of. He added, that without con&s;ulting his particu|lar Intere&s;ts in this, he was obliged to ac|quaint her Maje&s;ty, as being her Servant, that it was not the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Spain</HI> for the Ladies to have &s;uch free Acce&s;s into the Queen's Apart|ment, and that generally they were introduced by the <HI>Camerara Major</HI> only. The Queen li&s;tn'd to this Advice the Chief Mini&s;ter &s;ent her, but had no Inclinations to follow it; becau&s;e &s;he found he de&s;igned to &s;ubject her intirely to the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquerque</HI> after the &s;ame manner as &s;he had been to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova.</HI></P>
<P>She knew that in all the differences he had with the Queen-Mother, the <HI>Camerara Major</HI> al|ways declared for him, that &s;he embraced his In|tere&s;ts with more Zeal than her own, and that &s;he had clearly forgotten all that the Queen-Mother had done for her to advance her to this place. The Queen had no de&s;ire to throw her &s;elf again into a Captivity, from which &s;he had lately got her &s;elf delivered with &s;o much dif|ficulty. Thus &s;he was content to examine the Motives which made them &s;et &s;o many Intreagues on Foot, but had no mind to be the Victim.</P>

The Duke had &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;ole Affections of his Ma&s;ter, that he could never forgive tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were in a Capacity to become his Rivals; and he ad|ded a certain Air of Sincerity to his words, whenever he &s;poke ill of any one, that the King was really per&s;waded he had no private by-ends in doing it: His Relations, nay, even his Friends had no more Privileges than o|thers, who were indifferent to him. The Duke was believed, becau&s;e he always pa&s;&s;ed for an hone&s;t Gentleman; but one ought to have a great Fund of Vertue, not to be cor|rupted when he becomes a Favourite. He repre&s;ented to the King, all tho&s;e that came near his Per&s;on, as &s;o many Secret Enemies and Dome&s;tick Spies, who had neither Zeal nor Affection for him: And the&s;e Impre&s;&s;i|ons wrought &s;o far upon the King's Spirit, that he was &s;carce ever able to wear them off. The Duke not only did ill Offices to tho&s;e that belonged to the King's Hou&s;hold, but he extended his Malice to all tho&s;e who were able to maintain any Intelligence between the Queen and the Queen-Mother. He was per&s;waded, that the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> and his Lady, contributed to it all that lay in their Power; and this made him conceive an Aver&s;ion for them both: He &s;poke of them daily to the King, after a very di&s;obliging man|ner, and laid &s;everal things to their charge wherein they were not concerned. This made the King &s;o mightily di&s;plea&s;ed with them, that he could not forbear to tell the Queen one Day, as they accidentaly talked of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars,</HI> That he had poy&s;oned <Q REND="inline">all the Court, and that he would rather chu&s;e to have an open War with <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="167">
than &s;uch an Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Madrid.</HI></Q> He af|ter this let fall &s;ome reflecting Words again&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, which &s;ufficiently te&s;ti|fied what &s;trange Thoughts he had of her; although we may &s;afely &s;ay, that neither &s;he nor her Husband de&s;erved it. But the Rea|&s;on why the Chief Mini&s;ter was &s;o provoked again&s;t them, was, becau&s;e he was well inform|ed that the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI>; the Duke <HI>de Veraguas,</HI> the Admi|ral of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and &s;ome others had &s;een him in private, and communicated to him their De|&s;igns again&s;t him, to which he was to contri|bute &s;omething on his &s;ide, by getting the Queen to &s;upport the Project. But &s;uppo&s;e the Am|ba&s;&s;ador really knew of their Intentions, this is no good Con&s;equence, that he was willing to &s;econd them; and indeed there is little pro|bability to believe it, becau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;ador had no Rea&s;on to de&s;ire the Removal of the Chief Mini&s;ter; and the Duke's Abilities were not &s;o formidable, that the Court of <HI>France</HI> had any occa&s;ion to be apprehen&s;ive of him.</P>
<P>While the Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> was thus divided about the little Intrigues I have mentioned, the People continued to cry out and com|plain of their Grievances, becau&s;e no care was taken to redre&s;s them. It was now a full year &s;ince the Duke <HI>De Medina Celi</HI> had been made Chief Mini&s;ter, and it was hoped that he would have taken all nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures in a matter &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and important, as was the ea&s;ing of the People; but he &s;o far forgot his Duty, that every thing went wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;till; and indeed the lea&s;t Inconveniences &s;en|&s;ibly improve in their Malignity, when they are neglected. The le&s;&s;ening the Value of the Copper-Money had occa&s;ioned a great Di&s;order:
<PB N="166" REF="168">
'Tis true indeed it might have been managed to the Publick Advantage, but they took &s;uch wrong mea&s;ures in the Regulation, that it be|came a mo&s;t horrible Oppre&s;&s;ion; for the Species of Gold and Silver being thus reduced to one half of its ju&s;t Value, Foreigners took &s;uch hold of this opportunity, that they exported prodigious Sums out of the Kingdom. Be&s;ides this, the price of <HI>Segovia</HI> Wooll, which is an excel|lent Commodity, and brings a mighty Profit to tho&s;e that deal in it, ro&s;e in proportion to the abatement of the Money; &s;o that no body would buy it, unle&s;s they would &s;ink the Price: And things being in this condition, then at la&s;t came the crying down of the Money, and this totally compleated and ratified their Mi&s;ery. There was computed to be of it to the Value of Six Millions of Crowns. The King did not at all take them off, although he had promi&s;ed by his Edict, to pay the full Value of the Metal, to tho&s;e who brought them into the Offices appoint|ed to receive them. So all this Money lay ab&s;o|lutely dead: And it is no ea&s;ie matter to expre&s;s the Lo&s;s which the Bankers, the Merchants, the King's Farmers, and almo&s;t every private Man &s;uffered by this decrying of it down. Foreign|ers were the only Men that made Advantage of this General Misfortune of <HI>Spain:</HI> They bought this Copper-Money, that was mixt with a good Allay of Silver, for very little, and &s;ent it to <HI>Genoa,</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> and other Places. The Council very well knew the Prejudice the King+dom received by it, and A&s;&s;embled &s;everal times to find out an Expedient to put a &s;top to it: There were &s;ome Undertakers, that offered to treat for all of it, and &s;eparate the Silver from the Copper; and as I &s;aid before, <HI>Don Philip Vinzam,</HI> was made choice of in this Affair; but
<PB N="167" REF="169">
he had not been preferred before others, if it had not been for the Credit of <HI>Don Pedro de Arraga|&s;on.</HI> This Man owed him great Sums of Mo|ney, and had been twice Bankrupt, and was ju&s;t upon the Point of breaking the third time; &s;o he was de&s;irous to introduce him into &s;ome great bu&s;ine&s;s, that he might by this means enrich him&s;elf, and be in a capacity of paying his Debts: But this Project did not &s;ucceed, becau&s;e &s;o great a quantity of this Money was already carried out of the Kingdom, and the &s;eparating of the Allay was &s;o difficult a matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Lo&s;&s;es were the cau&s;e that abundance of Per&s;ons of great Quality found them&s;elves un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling their Plate and Jewels. 'Tis true, there is &s;o much both of the one and the other at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that it cannot well fail in a long time. What made &s;everal private Men &s;uffer the more, was, that the Rents of the Town-Hall, which were reduced from Eight to Five in the Hundred, were not now paid at all; becau&s;e the <HI>Corregidors</HI> and <HI>Regidors,</HI> who were concerned in the Payment of it, were &s;uch great Villains, that although the City was &s;ufficiently hara&s;&s;ed with Cu&s;toms, Taxes, and heavy Du|ties, before the&s;e People had drained it as long as they plea&s;ed, and that they had put &s;ome &s;mall incon&s;iderable matter of it into the King's Coffers; there was nothing more left out of &s;o many Impo&s;ts, and yet they were not levied for the greate&s;t part, but under the pretence of &s;atis|fying the Rents of the Town-Hall.</P>
<P>But how was it po&s;&s;ible to put things, as they now &s;tood, into a better Order? It was re&s;olved, that there &s;hould not be above four <HI>Regidors</HI>; there had been more than Fifty, and their Places were worth Sixty Thou&s;and Crowns. It is cer|tain, that before they could reimbur&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="168" REF="170">
of &s;uch a Sum, they mu&s;t be guilty of great Extortion and Cheating.</P>
<P>An Order was &s;ent from <HI>Madrid</HI> to all the Ports to publi&s;h Repri&s;als in favour of the Sub|jects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the Ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI> I have already &s;poke of the Ve&s;&s;el which that E|lector's Subjects had taken away from his Catho|lick Maje&s;ty. The Elector had allowed three Months to redeem her, but they were not in a Condition to do it. The Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> laboured to Accommodate the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s with no Succe&s;s; becau&s;e the Elector declared he would be paid his Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns that were due to him, and he would re|&s;tore nothing but upon that Condition. And there|fore the Court would rather &s;uffer him to enjoy his Prize: However, to &s;ave the Honour of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Mini&s;ters pretended, that the King would have his Ve&s;&s;el re&s;tored before he would do any thing, and that he refu&s;ed to hearken to any o|ther Propo&s;al till that were executed.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother, who &s;eldom &s;tirred a|broad, and who lived a very Melancholy Life at her Palace, invited the Young Queen one day to Dinner, when the King was gone out a Hunting: They afterwards &s;hut them|&s;elves up in the Queen-Mother's great Clo&s;et, and (as &s;he told the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Mortare,</HI> from whom I afterwards had the Story) they began to weep and embrace one another ve|ry tenderly. The Queen-Mother complained, <HI>That the Queen her Daughter-in-Law, had preju|diced the King again&s;t her, and that &s;he &s;uffered as great a Confinement, as if</HI> Don Juan <HI>did &s;till Govern; that &s;he was not ignorant that the Duke</HI> de Medina Celi<HI>, </HI>d'Eguya<HI>, and the Confe&s;&s;or did her all the ill Offices they were able; that if</HI>

<HI>&s;he had only the&s;e to Combat, &s;he would endea|vour to de&s;troy them; that perhaps &s;he might be a+ble to accompli&s;h it, but that when &s;he &s;aw the Queen at the Head of the Party, &s;he had no Cou|rage left to defend her &s;elf; that although &s;he very well knew, &s;he had promi&s;ed to do her all the Injury &s;he could, yet &s;he could not forbear to &s;peak to her of it, rather to ea&s;e her &s;elf, than out of any Hopes to &s;often her di&s;po&s;itions. Alas, Madam, Alas,</HI> cryed the Young Queen all in Tears, <HI>why do you add &s;uch &s;tabbing Su&s;picions to the other ills you have done me? Could you not be conteat to poy|&s;on my Conduct before the King, and make him &s;hew me a thou&s;and &s;en&s;ible unkindne&s;&s;es upon that &s;core, but mu&s;t you in&s;ult upon me too, and accu&s;e me of the only thing in the World I am uncapable of doing?</HI> At the&s;e words, the Queen-Mother &s;tretch|ed out her Arms to her, and they tarried a con|&s;iderable &s;pace of time without being able to &s;peak a Syllable; &s;o much were both their Minds prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t each other: But at la&s;t, when they could &s;peak in cold Blood, and came to examine what had been &s;aid on both &s;ides, they were &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome ill Per&s;ons had endeavoured to di&s;-unite them, in order to Fortifie their own Party, which was equally contrary to them both. They gave one another an Account of the mea&s;ures that had been taken, of the Per&s;ons that were con|cerned in them, of tho&s;e whom they ought to &s;u&s;pect for the time to come, and they re&s;olved to employ all their Intere&s;t to de&s;troy the oppo&s;ite Cabal. They &s;tayed together till it was Night, and on the next day, which was the fifth of <HI>February,</HI> the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> gave the King and the two Queens a Magni|ficent Collation, accompanied with Mu&s;ick. The King's Dwarf, who is one of the prettie&s;t

They were both of them dre&s;s'd after the <HI>Indian</HI> Fa&s;hion, covered with Feathers of Birds of different colours; they had little Tabors, and played prettily upon them. This Fea&s;t was followed by another at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don Pedro d'Arragon,</HI> where the Queen danced before the King, which &s;he had never done be|fore, although &s;he acquitted her &s;elf that way to admiration. She had purpo&s;ely learned the <HI>Ca|naries</HI> and a <HI>Saraband</HI>; &s;o that the King was perfectly charmed to &s;ee her &s;o expert in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dances, and told her &s;everal times as he pre&s;&s;ed her Arms with his two Hands, <HI>Mi Reina, Mi Reina, eres la mas perfeta de todo el Orbe:</HI> That is to &s;ay, <HI>My Queen, my Queen, you are the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Per&s;on in the whole World.</HI> The Queen-Mother &s;ent her that Evening a Watch all adorned with Diamonds, and a Gold-Chain of exqui&s;ite Work; &s;he writ a Let|ter to her, wherein &s;he wi&s;hed that this Watch would only &s;hew her happy and plea|&s;ant Hours. The Queen returned her this An|&s;wer, that they would be always &s;o, if &s;he would continue to love her. She afterwards de&s;ired the King to tell her &s;ome tender thing, that &s;he might &s;end it to the Queen-Mother. The King told her immediately <HI>No tengo, que de&s;ir.</HI> How, Sir, &s;ays the Queen, have you nothing to &s;ay to the Queen your Mother? I be&s;eech you to give me a Compliment that may plea&s;e her. The King &s;tudied a long time what to &s;end her, and at la&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Ponga os mi Reina, que jo</HI>

<P>The King di&s;patched an Order to Prince <HI>A|lexander,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> to make a grand Reform among&s;t the Officers of War and Ju&s;tice.

The Count <HI>de Palma,</HI> Nephew to Cardinal <HI>Portocarero,</HI> had the Government of <HI>Malaga,</HI> and the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Granada,</HI> in the room of the Count <HI>de Cifuentes,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Hi|jar,</HI> Son-in-law to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra-Nova,</HI> obtained the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Arragon.</HI> This Dutche&s;s had not appeared at Court ever &s;ince &s;he had quitted it with &s;o great a Di&s;gu&s;t: But her Son-in-law having now received this new Fa|vour, &s;he was re&s;olved to go and vi&s;it the Queen on the tenth of <HI>February.</HI> She had already &s;ent to her Maje&s;ty, to demand her Permi&s;&s;ion, and the Queen &s;ent her word, that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee her. The Dutche&s;s at her entrance into the Queen's Chamber, &s;eemed at fir&s;t a little di&s;ordered: She excu&s;ed her not coming to Court upon the account of a long fit of Sick|ne&s;s, and then added, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty I did not think I &s;hould have been able to live, after my misfortune to be &s;eparated from you.</HI> The Queen told her, that &s;he had been informed of her Indi&s;po&s;ition, but that this was not a place for her to &s;peak of what made her unea&s;ie, and in effect pa&s;&s;ed to &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> fixed her Eyes continu|ally on the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquerque,</HI> as if &s;he had a mind to devour her; and the Dutche&s;s <HI>d'Albuquerque,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were neither better

nor &s;weeter than hers, looked askew upon her, and they let fall every other moment &s;ome Ex|pre&s;&s;ions that were a little eager.</P>
<P>One of the Footmen belonging to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had committed &s;ome In&s;olence, and the Ju&s;tices ordered him to be Apprehended for it: But this Mini&s;ter pretending that it was a|gain&s;t the Privilege of Amba&s;&s;adors, complain|ed of it to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> but he did not receive &s;o favourable an An&s;wer from him as he expected. This &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted him, that he went to acquaint the re&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;adors with it, who all agreed to repre&s;ent the Con&s;e|quences of &s;uch an Action to the Duke <HI>de Me|dina Celi</HI> in a large Memorial conceived in very har&s;h Terms, which they &s;ent to him all at the &s;ame time. The Chief Mini&s;ter carried it to the Council of State, who after they had maturely deliberated upon the Affair, were of Ad|vice that they &s;hould &s;et the Footman immedi|ately at liberty. The Amba&s;&s;adors were re&s;olved, in ca&s;e they had refu&s;ed them this Satisfaction, to have forced the Pri&s;on to fetch him out.</P>
<P>Con&s;table <HI>Colonna</HI> came back to <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Fe|burary.</HI> The mo&s;t important Affair that brought him thither, was his de&s;ire to Accommodate Matters with his Lady, and to find out a way for both of them to live in Peace. The Mar|riage of his Son with the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> did al&s;o take him up very much. The Queen was concerned at the Misfortunes of his Wife, and it was no &s;mall trouble to her to under&s;tand what ill u&s;age a Per&s;on of her Qua|lity received in Pri&s;on: Nay, &s;he was particular|ly obliged to protect her, by rea&s;on of the Pro|mi&s;e the Duke had made her, and the Confidence the Con&s;table's Lady repo&s;ed in it. The&s;e Rea|&s;ons engaged her to charge her Confe&s;&s;or to do

all he could with the Con&s;table, in order to Ne|gotiate an Accommodation, and &s;ee whether he would carry her into <HI>Italy,</HI> or &s;uffer her to &s;tay in &s;ome Religious Convent at <HI>Madrid,</HI> as &s;he had already been. But the Con&s;table and his Wife were &s;trangely exa&s;perated again&s;t one another: She re&s;ented to the Life the unworthy Treatment &s;he had received; and the mutual occa&s;ions they had to complain, hindered them from con&s;enting to what might contribute to their common &s;atis|faction. At la&s;t, the Con&s;table being earne&s;tly importuned by the Queen, and advi&s;ed by the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbazez,</HI> propo&s;ed, that his Wife &s;hould turn a Religious, and that he, for his part, &s;hould take the Habit of a Knight of <HI>Malta.</HI> This at fir&s;t appeared very &s;urpri&s;ing to all the World, but indeed was more &s;trange to the Con&s;table's Lady than to any one; for 'tis certain &s;he had no great de&s;ire to that Life, and her Inclination did not very well reli&s;h Three mortifying Vows, an au&s;tere Cloy&s;tering, and a &s;evere Rule. Neverthele&s;s, the Con&s;table was &s;o po&s;itive, that all his Wive's Friends were &s;atis|fied there was no other way to deliver the unfor|tunate Lady out of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Segovia,</HI> but by obliging her to give her con&s;ent to what he pro|po&s;ed. Thus at la&s;t they prevailed upon her to con&s;ent to it; &s;o &s;he was brought back to <HI>Ma|drid</HI> on the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1681. where &s;he immediately was &s;hut up among&s;t the Nuns of the Conception of the Order of St. <HI>Jerome.</HI> She was &s;o afflicted at her Misfortunes, that &s;he would &s;ee no body but her Children: She told them &s;he looked upon her &s;elf to be the mo&s;t Unfortunate Creature in the World, and that &s;he was going to do a thing which might co&s;t her the Repo&s;e of her Life; That &s;he beheld the Con&s;e|quences
<PB N="174" REF="176">
of it with Terror, but that neverthele&s;s &s;he was re&s;olved to undergo it, becau&s;e &s;he had given her Promi&s;e. In effect, &s;he went down in|to the Quire, where every thing was prepared for the Ceremony, and &s;he took upon her the Habit of a Novice, but with a formal de&s;ign to die rather than make Profe&s;&s;ion. She wore a Pet|ticoat of Gold and Silver Brocard, under her Woollen Robe, and when &s;he was not in company with any of the Nuns, &s;he would throw her Veil a&s;ide, and put a Coif upon her Head, after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode, dre&s;s'd with Ribbons of all Co|lours. Sometimes it &s;o happened, that the Bell rung to Chappel, where &s;he was obliged to make her Appearance by the Rule of her Order, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Novices comming to inform her of it, &s;he clapt on her Frock and Veil over her Ribbons and her loo&s;e Hair: This made a very odd and comical Figure, and no body could have forborn laughing at it, had not her Mi&s;e|ries on the other hand, drawn the Compa&s;&s;ion of all Per&s;ons that knew her; for indeed her Condition was very Nece&s;&s;itous, &s;he wanted Money, had but mean Eating, and yet wor&s;e Lodging. One Day as I happened to be in the Queen's Retinue, I entred the Convent; and the Con&s;table's Lady carried me to her Cham|ber; I was like to have been &s;tarved with the Cold there; it was as high as a Tennis-Court, and not to flatter the Place, it was no better than a great Barn. The Con&s;table got a Di&s;pen&s;ation from <HI>Rome</HI> to ha&s;ten the time of her Profe&s;&s;ion: and he him&s;elf was obliged, as I have already &s;aid, to take the Vows of the Order of <HI>Malta</HI>&punc; but he was told every day, that his Wife had an unconquerable Aver&s;ion to become a Religious&punc; and at la&s;t had no hopes of it: The Marque&s;s <HI>de</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="177">
<HI>Los Balbazez,</HI> as well as the Marchione&s;s, were not a little concerned to be laught at by all the World. The Con&s;table concluded the Marriage of his Elde&s;t Son with the Daughter of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and parted three days af|ter to return to <HI>Rome:</HI> He carried his Si&s;ter-in|law, and his two Sons along with him. As for his Lady, &s;he &s;till tarried in the Convent, where &s;he wore the Habit of a Religious long enough, and at la&s;t quitted it.</P>
<P>The King and Queen went to the <HI>Je&s;uits Col|lege,</HI> to &s;ee a Tragedy, where a young Scholar, who Per&s;onated a Fury, coming upon the Thea|tre with a lighted Torch in his Hand, perceived his Tutor in a Corner, who acted a Chymi&s;t: In all appearance he bore him a Grudge; for he ran after him, and burnt his Beard and Hair, and pur&s;ued him like a real Fury indeed. He play'd his part &s;o well, that the King was mightily plea&s;ed with him, and would needs have them begin that Scene again, becau&s;e it was the pretti|e&s;t in the Play. The Scholar de&s;ired it withal his Heart, but neither his Tutor, nor any of the College, had a mind to be concerned in the other part. The <HI>Carnival</HI> approached, and a Comedy was play'd the three la&s;t days of it at Court. On the 19th of <HI>February,</HI> which was <HI>A&s;h-Wedne&s;day,</HI> the King had a Solemn Service at the Chappel Royal, and ordered the Amba&s;&s;adors to be told, that he would continue to have one every Week, except <HI>Holyday Week.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> ap|plied him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to find out means to &s;et a Fleet to Sea by the Spring, and treated with &s;ome of the principal Bankers of <HI>Madrid,</HI> who&s;e Names were <HI>Dominico Grillo, Franci&s;co de Mon|&s;erato,</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;io Dionis.</HI> The fir&s;t engaged
<PB N="176" REF="178">
to &s;end a Hundred Thou&s;and Pia&s;ters a Month to <HI>Flanders,</HI> the &s;econd to remit Fifty Thou&s;and to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and the third Thirty Thou&s;and to <HI>Na|var.</HI> But what &s;ignified all the&s;e Treaties, &s;ince they were not in a Condition to furni&s;h nece&s;&s;a|ry Funds? The Court received Advice from <HI>Na|ples,</HI> from whence they expected &s;ome Supplies in Money, That the Prince <HI>de Belvedere,</HI> and &s;everal of the Principal Barons, were retired to their re&s;pective Country-Hou&s;es, by rea&s;on of the great Di&s;orders and Mi&s;ery of that City. Be|&s;ides this, they were informed, that the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Trapan,</HI> and of two other Cities in that Kingdom, had made an In&s;urrection, killed their Governor and Judges, and at the &s;ame time had &s;ent to demand A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Turks.</HI> This News found but an Unwelcome Reception at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>There arrived al&s;o at Court a Deputy of the Commerce at <HI>Sevil,</HI> with whom I had a long Conver&s;ation. He a&s;&s;ured me, that that great and &s;tately City was reduced to a Condition which amazed all the World; That there did not now remain one fourth part of its Inhabitants&punc; That the Impo&s;ts increa&s;ed every day; and that this City, which but about Fifty Years ago, was one of the Riche&s;t in the Univer&s;e, was now ready to &s;ink for want of relief; although the Gallions arrived there, and it &s;till enjoy'd the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Trade of any Place in <HI>Spain</HI>&punc; We may hence ju&s;tly conclude, in what a &s;ad Condition the re&s;t of the Cities of <HI>Spain</HI> were re+duced to, &s;ince the be&s;t of them was almo&s;t ruined&punc; This Rea&s;on obliged me to enquire of a certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gentleman, who was well acquainted in tho&s;e</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Affairs, what the Revenues of the King of <HI>Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> might amount to? He told me, That in read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="177" REF="179">
Money only, which came from the <HI>Indies,</HI> they amounted to Thirty Millions and Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Ducats, which in <HI>French</HI> Money is worth &s;omewhat more than Seventy Five Milli|ons of Livers: But then it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the King does not touch a third part of this Sum, the greate&s;t part of it being either otherwi&s;e gaged or purloined: And yet out of this third part are to be defrayed the Expences of the Pa|lace, the Pen&s;ions his Maje&s;ty be&s;tows, and the Payment of his Armies. He is likewi&s;e obliged to be &s;till &s;ending con&s;iderable Sums to <HI>Milan,</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and to <HI>Flan|ders:</HI> For the Vice-Roys and Governors take ef|fectual care that the King &s;hall not draw a Farthing out of tho&s;e Kingdoms and Provinces; they keep all the Profits to them&s;elves: And this is the Rea&s;on why Money is &s;o often wanting, even for the nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions of the King's Hou&s;e. But after all, I can by no means be per&s;waded, but that he is richer than he is generally &s;uppo|&s;ed to be; for there is no probability that other|wi&s;e he could be able to give as he does, &s;uch con&s;iderable Pen&s;ions, and &s;o much in &s;tanding Wages, to &s;o va&s;t a number of People. It is true, the&s;e Liberalities &s;o mightily incommoded him, that about the beginning of the Year 1681. all the Livery-men of the Stables, having waited two Years together for their Wages, left the King's Service on the &s;ame day, and looked abroad to get a Livelihood; &s;o that his Hor&s;es had no bo|dy to look after them, or give them Corn. This appeared &s;o much the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e the Table of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, was ab&s;olutely laid a&s;ide, although it was the only one the King kept in his Palace. The Women that waited upon the Queen had no better luck,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
and the Court could not be &s;upplied with Money enough to defray the lea&s;t Expences. This Ex|tremity la&s;ted for a while, and then things were e&s;tabli&s;hed as formerly. But what is very re|markable, and de&s;erves the la&s;t Commendation, the Soldiers, notwith&s;tanding this Mi&s;ery, con|tinued &s;till in the Service; although there were &s;everal Officers, nay, entire Regiments of them that had not received two Months pay in three Years. However, this was the rea&s;on that abun|dance of Gari&s;ons were ill provided with Men, and in a very bad Condition, and particularly on the &s;ide of <HI>E&s;tr&agrave; Madura,</HI> where neverthele&s;s it was their Intere&s;t to have been more careful; becau&s;e the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had very con&s;iderable Po&s;ts in that part of the Country.</P>
<P>We &s;aw the Governors of St. <HI>Seba&s;tian, Bil|boa,</HI> and <HI>Fontarabia</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who came on purpo&s;e to acquaint the Council of War, that their Soldiers died of hunger, that the younge&s;t of them had de&s;erted, that none but the old and infirm were left behind in the Garri&s;ons; and that in a &s;hort time there would be none of the&s;e left, unle&s;s they gave them a &s;peedy Relief. They had fair Promi&s;es made them, they return|ed back, but were forgotten as well as a great number of others.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;urprizing, and cannot ea&s;ily be believed; that in this very <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o exce&s;&s;ively poor and exhau&s;ted, as it &s;eems to be, the <HI>Flota</HI> from the <HI>Indies</HI> only, in the Year 1680, brought Thirty Millions of Gold. But of the&s;e prodi|gious Summs that arrive there every Year, we mu&s;t deduct near two thirds which the Foreign|ers draw away for the &s;everal Goods they furni&s;h them with; and be&s;ides there is a way found to cheat the King of the fifth Penney, which is due
<PB N="179" REF="181">
to him, out of all the Silver that comes from the <HI>Indies.</HI> There is another thing &s;till behind that contributes exceedingly to make the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> &s;o de&s;titute of Money as they are, and that is the prodigious number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> who come to help them, whether in the Tillage of the Ground, or in their Buildings, or any other things of a more &s;ervile Nature, which the <HI>Don Diegos</HI> and the <HI>Don Dodriguez</HI> think &s;o much below them, either out of a Principle of Vanity or Idlene&s;s, that they had rather chu&s;e to &s;tarve, than re&s;olve to &s;et about them. But Foreigners are not &s;o nice and delicate, they come hither, and when they have &s;craped a lit|tle Money together, they return to their own Country; in the mean time others come in their room, and are employed in the &s;ame Work. They are computed generally to be full Forty Thou&s;and, who come in and go out of the Kingdom after this manner, and there is not one of them who does not carry away with him Se|ven or Eight Pi&s;toles every Year, and &s;ometimes more. It is ea&s;ie to judge that this ari&s;es to a prodigious Summ.</P>
<P>The People &s;till continued to cry out and ex|claim, and at la&s;t the Duke fatigu'd with the great bu&s;ine&s;s he had upon his Hands, and with the&s;e continual Complaints, re&s;olved to erect a Juncto to &s;et things in order again, and en|deavour to relieve the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities. He ca&s;t his Eyes upon a Per&s;on of great Abilities, who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Lopez de los Rios,</HI> and who&s;e Vertue and Experience were &s;ufficiently known; for he had always bore &s;ome Office ei|ther in the Civil Government, or the Finances. He had fir&s;t &s;hew'd a great Zeal, and the heat of this Zeal did not at all abate in his Mind,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
but he found him&s;elf not &s;trong enough to cope with all the Enemies alone, whom he mu&s;t ex|pect to create by a &s;evere and &s;teady Conduct. Se|veral Per&s;ons, nay, even the Mini&s;ters intere&s;ted in the&s;e Affairs, directly thwarted him; and by this means de&s;troyed all that he had e&s;tabli&s;hed with &s;o much Pains and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>On the 23<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>February</HI> a private Act of the Inqui&s;ition was performed in the Church of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> where Twenty Per&s;ons were con|demned for being guilty of Super&s;tition, Sorce|ry, and Judai&s;m. The Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> who came back from <HI>Flanders,</HI> arrived about this time at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the Duke <HI>d'Hijar</HI> parted from thence to go to <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the Vice-Roy&s;hip of <HI>Arragon.</HI> Two days after this, which was the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Mondejar</HI> was made a Grandee of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one,</HI> who now began to be weary of not &s;upplying his Place him&s;elf, de&s;ired &s;ome of his Friends to intercede with the King in his behalf, that he mightcome to Court; and the King con&s;ented to it, with this Provi&s;o, that he &s;hould perform his Duty better for the time to come. The Count <HI>de Pouar,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Montiel</HI> were forbidden the Court; both of them were pa&s;&s;ionately in love with <HI>Donna Fran|ci&s;ca d'Alcannicas,</HI> Lady of Honour to the Queen, and Niece to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> The Count <HI>de Pouar</HI> was under her Chamber Window, and entertained her there with his Fingers, as is the manner of <HI>Spain,</HI> and told her a Story very much to the di&s;advantage of the Count <HI>de Montiel,</HI> who lay hid in a Corner, where he &s;aw and under&s;tood all; &s;o that coming towards the Count <HI>de Pouar</HI> all enraged, with his
<PB N="181" REF="183">
Hand upon the Guard of his Sword, he told him he was a perfidious Villain, and that he might thank his good Fortune for being in the Palace. The Count <HI>de Pouar</HI> coldly an&s;wered, that he would go out of it as &s;oon as he had told <HI>Donna Franci&s;ca</HI> two or three things he had &s;till to &s;ay no her, and that he came &s;ea&s;onably enough to be a Witne&s;s of them, becau&s;e they concerned him. The Count <HI>de Montiel</HI> tran&s;|ported with Choler, was upon the point of draw|ing his Sword upon his Rival. But the Duke <HI>d'U&s;&s;eda,</HI> Brother to <HI>Donna Franci&s;ca,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by that way with the Count <HI>d'Altamire,</HI> &s;he made them a &s;ign to draw near, and told them with her Fingers what had happened. The two Lords laboured all they could to make up the quarrel between the two Rivals, and &s;ucceeded in it; however this Accident could not be kept &s;o &s;ecret but that the King being informed of it, forbid them the Court.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Sejar</HI> parted from hence to go and &s;erve in <HI>Flanders</HI> in quality of a Volunteer. He was a Per&s;on of Illu&s;trious Birth, very Rich, and very Young; the rea&s;on he did this was only becau&s;e he was jealous of his Lady. The Count <HI>de Talara</HI> had the Place of Judge of the Forre&s;ts conferred upon him, which was vacant by the Death of the Marque&s;s <HI>de la Garde</HI>; and <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Man&s;erato</HI> obtained the Title of Marque&s;s <HI>de Tamarit.</HI> The King ordered the Council to di&s;charge all the Receivers of the Im|po&s;itions, that are laid upon the Provinces: The&s;e Officers were above a Thou&s;and, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of them mu&s;t needs be of great ad|vantage to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and to his Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184">
A Ve&s;&s;el which came to <HI>Cales</HI> from the <HI>Hon|duras,</HI> brought News, that the <HI>Flota</HI> was happi|ly arrrived on the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> and that the Merchants of <HI>Lima</HI> offered three Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns to the King, on condition that for an Year and half he would not &s;end the Gallions here. In the mean time, ill Wea|ther hindred the Fleet, which had &s;et Sail from <HI>Cales</HI> a little before, from doubling the Cape of St. <HI>Vinoent</HI>; the bad effects of this Tempe&s;t were not only perceived at Sea, for it was &s;o violent in all parts of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> that &s;everal Hou|&s;es were beaten down, and the exceeding Rains &s;o &s;welled the Rivers, that the Roads were o'rflown; and almo&s;t all the Bridges carried a|way by the rapidity of the Waters.</P>
<P>This ill news was followed immediately by three Couriers, one upon the neck of another, and the fir&s;t of them arrived on the thirteenth of <HI>March,</HI> from Abbot <HI>Ma&s;&s;erati,</HI> Envoy of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Portugal.</HI> He di&s;patched them to inform the Council, that they had received Advice at <HI>Lisbon</HI> by a Ve&s;&s;el, that the Go|vernour of <HI>Bueno&s;aires,</HI> having got together abundance of <HI>Indians,</HI> had joined them to his Garri&s;on; that on the 15th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1680. he had &s;urpri&s;ed the Fort which the <HI>Portugue|&s;es</HI> had began to build in the I&s;le of St. <HI>Ga|briel</HI>; that he had taken the Governour Pri|&s;oner, and cut the Garri&s;on in pieces; that the Prince-Regent being provoked at this In|&s;ult, had a&s;&s;embled the Council of State, where the Queen of <HI>Portugal</HI> was pre&s;ent; that they had re&s;olved to rai&s;e the Militia, and &s;end 400 Hor&s;e, and Four Regiments of Old Soldiers into <HI>E&s;tramadura</HI>; that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to get Magazines ready on the Frontiers, and
<PB N="183" REF="185">
to have a General Rendezvous at <HI>Eluas</HI>; that having demanded Audience of the Prince-Re|gent, he had refu&s;ed it him, and that in all probability a War would en&s;ue. 'Twas ex|pected at Court that the Envoy of <HI>Portugal</HI> would make his Complaints, but they were extremely &s;urprized to &s;ee him take no notice of it at all: So now it was not doubted, but that this Silence certainly pre&s;aged a Surprize of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Territories, like to that which the Governour of <HI>Bueno&s;aires</HI> had committed in the <HI>Indies</HI> upon the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> The Mi|ni&s;ters judged it convenient to prevent this blow, and &s;poke to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador about it; de&s;iring him to repre&s;ent to the Envoy of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> that the King of <HI>England</HI> would be ob|liged to take up Arms again&s;t him who fir&s;t broke the Peace, whereof he was Guarantee; that he had al&s;o a more particular Rea&s;on than this, fora&s;much as by the League that was con|cluded between the King his Ma&s;ter, and his Catholick Maje&s;ty, they had mutually enga|ged to Declare again&s;t the Enemy that fell up|on either of them. This Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;poke with a great deal of Heat; but the Envoy of <HI>Portugal</HI> an&s;wered him, That he looked upon him to be a Parti&s;an of the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> rather than an Amba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>England</HI>; that he knew very well he &s;poke without Order, and of his own Head: This An&s;wer was followed by a Prote&s;tation in Writing, wherein it was declared that the King of <HI>England</HI> could not upon any Rea&s;on whatever hinder the Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> from u&s;ing the Right of Repri&s;als, and endeavour|ing to get Satisfaction from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the Injuries received.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186">
A little after this, the Envoy of <HI>Portugal</HI> re|ceived an Order from the Prince Regent to de|mand Publick Audience upon this Occa&s;ion; and told his Catholick Maje&s;ty, that he de|manded an entire Satisfaction from him, and that the Prince Regent de&s;ired, that they would &s;et the Soldiers and Governour at Liberty; that they would puni&s;h tho&s;e of <HI>Bueno&s;aires</HI>; that they would re&s;tore the Ammunition and Cannon; that if the Fort were razed, they would rebuild it, or el&s;e &s;urrender the place; that in ca&s;e the Pri&s;oners were &s;ent into <HI>Spain,</HI> they would &s;et them at Liberty; that they would receive into the Port of St. <HI>Gabriel</HI> the Garri&s;on which the Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hould &s;end thither; that the Governour of <HI>Bueno|&s;aires</HI> &s;hould be cha&s;ti&s;ed, and that an An&s;wer be given in within Twenty Days, or el&s;e they would begin Actions of Ho&s;tility. Upon this the Council met, and &s;pent three days to de|liberate about it. They gave Orders for their Forces to march towards the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, defencele&s;s places, and <HI>Don Antonio Panyagua,</HI> Ma&s;ter-General of the Camp, was charged to &s;tay there, till he &s;aw an end of this Affair.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides they &s;et forth a great Memorial, where|in were contained the Arguments which the En|voy of <HI>Spain</HI> had given in at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to make it appear by Authentick Papers, that according to the Limits appointed by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. the I&s;le of St. <HI>Gabriel</HI> belongs to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that they have had it a Hundred and Four&s;core and Six Years in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. After this, they took notice of the Declaration of the Envoy of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and ended all with a Prote&s;tation, &s;ignifying, That they were de&s;irous to pre&s;erve the Peace, and that they would labour with all
<PB N="185" REF="187">
Application in this matter. This <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> was &s;ent to all the Foreign Mini&s;ters to com|municate to their Ma&s;ters; but they had &s;carce given it to them, when they &s;ent in all ha&s;te back back again, for the Copies to Correct &s;omething or other, and then they returned them again. At the &s;ame time a Rumour was indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed, that the <HI>Nuncio</HI> by an expre&s;s Order from the Pope, had moved them to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to treat about an Accommodation. But this was re|ally a Temperament they had found out to conceal the true Motives which engaged them to make this Advance. The <HI>Nuncio</HI> upon this &s;aid openly, that he had never interpo&s;ed in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to receive any Orders from <HI>Rome</HI> about &s;o fre&s;h an Affair.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Giovennazzo</HI> was cho&s;en for this Emba&s;&s;y. As &s;oon as he was arrived at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> he &s;aw the Prince-Regent, who nominated the Duke <HI>de Cadaval,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Fronteyra</HI> for Commi&s;&s;ioners. He would have made his Complaints at fir&s;t, and demanded Satisfaction; but he was told that they were of a Humour clearly oppo&s;ite to what he pre|tended; and that matters were to be done con|formable to the Memorial which the Envoy of <HI>Portugal</HI> had pre&s;ented at <HI>Madrid</HI>; or el&s;e let the Affair go whither it would for them. After &s;ome &s;light conte&s;tations, he gave his Con&s;ent to it, and di&s;patched a Courier to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> to inform the Court of what he had done. Immediately the Mini&s;ters bellowed out again&s;t him as a Man of no Judgment, who had violated his Fidelity to the King; pre|tending that he had infringed all the Rules of Prudence and good Sen&s;e, by a Conduct
<PB N="186" REF="188">
and an Accommodation &s;o di&s;advantageous to <HI>Spain,</HI> and that his In&s;tructions furni&s;hed him with no &s;uch Power. All the&s;e Circum&s;tances of Indignnation and Re&s;entment were only of|fered to the Honour of the Nation: But not|with&s;tanding all this, they did not lo&s;e a mo|ment to conclude the Accommodation, and the Ratification of it was &s;peedily &s;ent to the Duke <HI>de Giovenazzo.</HI></P>
<P>Money &s;till continued to be as &s;carce as ever at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and certain it is that it was the great|e&s;t difficulty in the World for the Council to provide a Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns for the King to go to <HI>Aranjuez.</HI> The Ceremonial of the Palace, whereof I have already made mention, orders this Summ preci&s;ely to be &s;pent in that &s;mall Journey, and here they are &s;o exact to follow it, that they would not for all the World lay out a Hundred Pi&s;toles le&s;s. But after the Money was once in the King's Coffers, the Council thought to &s;end it to the Forces that were kept on the Bor|ders of <HI>Portugal,</HI> by rea&s;on of the late dif|ference about the I&s;le of St. <HI>Garbiel.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> &s;poke to the King about it, and propo&s;ed that in this Juncture, they might take Money where ever they could find it; but he roundly an&s;wered him, <HI>Do what you will, pro|vided you don't meddle with that which is de&s;ign|ed for</HI> Aranjuez. He was not able to go thither all the Autumn, becau&s;e &s;uch a Summ of Mo|ney as is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e could not be then gotten ready.

The King tarried five Weeks at <HI>Aranjuez.</HI> This Royal Hou&s;e is within &s;even Leagues of <HI>Madrid.</HI> He goes no where all the Year round but there, and to the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> in <HI>October:</HI> The&s;e are his two great Journeys.</P>
<P>I went thither along with a Relation of mine to take leave of the Queen, and receive her Protection for a young Girl, whom I was to leave behind me in <HI>Spain,</HI> and was very dear to me. She told me, &s;he would take her in|to the Number of her Menines, and that I might a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf &s;he carried her own Re|commendation along with her, &s;ince &s;he came from <HI>France.</HI> She honoured me with her Pi|cture in Enamel, incircled with Diamonds, and I &s;en&s;ibly regret the lo&s;s of it to this very day. This is not a fit place to tell, how this Mis|fortune happened to me; perhaps I may &s;till write the Memoirs of another Court, where I re&s;ided &s;ome time, and which are no le&s;s particu|lar than the&s;e; and there I &s;hall have a fit oppor|tunity to &s;peak concerning the Portraiture of the Lovely Queen.</P>
