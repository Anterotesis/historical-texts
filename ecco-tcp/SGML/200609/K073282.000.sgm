<L>_TWelve Times hath <HI>Sol</HI> his annual Race begun,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Jove</HI> de&s;cended from his radiant Throne.</L>
<L>Around the pendent Globe the God pur&s;u'd</L>
<L>His circling March, and human Actions view'd,</L>
<L>But griev'd that Virtue droop'd her languid Head,</L>
<L>While Vice from Clime to Clime contagious &s;pread.</L>
<L>Back to his native Seat he &s;ternly flies,</L>
<L>And &s;ends an Edict thro' the &s;pacious Skies,</L>
<L>To call th'ethereal Pow'rs &s;wift flew his Word,</L>
