<HEAD>An ENQUIRY into the
DANGER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I CANNOT &s;ay that I am of the Num|ber
of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h, that if we have
a War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> they may beat
Us; becau&s;e it has &s;omething in it &s;o unnatu|ral,
for an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> or a <HI>Britain</HI> to rejoyce
in the De&s;truction of his own Country, and
in the Triumph of our Neighbours of any
kind over Us, that he cannot &s;ee it without
Horror and Aver&s;ion; yet I cannot but &s;ay,
I wi&s;h <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> who talk with &s;o much Satisfa|ction
of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> would look
a little into the certain Con&s;equences of &s;uch
a War, whether Victory or Di&s;advantage on
Our Side &s;hall attend it.</P>
<P>I take a War with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to have
this very unhappy Circum&s;tance in it, That
if we are beaten, it may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> ruin imme|diately,
and if we conquer, it may be our
ruin hereafter, &s;o that in general, get or
lo&s;e in the Field, we &s;hall certainly lo&s;e in
the War.</P>
<P>The immediate Lo&s;s of our Ships, of our
Men, of our Trade, and the farther load|ing
this Nation, with a mighty and in&s;up|portable
Expence, are the common Topicks
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of tho&s;e who argue in the u&s;ual Methods a|gain&s;t
this War; but though the&s;e are con|&s;iderable,
and &s;hall have &s;omething &s;aid to
them in their Cour&s;e; yet the&s;e are the lea&s;t
of the Evils, which if our Fore-&s;ight is not
clouded by the Power and Influence of Par|ties
found, may be by nece&s;&s;ary and inevttable
Con&s;equences, to follow the entring at this
time upon a War with the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> their Strength
at Sea, their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and their reigning Influence in the
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>East</HI> Seas, are Rea&s;ons why we
mu&s;t expect uncommon Mi&s;chiefs &s;hould at|tend
our Trade in the beginning of &s;uch a
War; this was always the Effect of a <HI>Dutch</HI>
War, and it was remarkable, that in the
la&s;t War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> we lo&s;t 2000 Sail of
Ships great and &s;mall the fir&s;t Year: No
part of our Commerce is free from them or
out of their reach: On the contrary, &s;ome
of the be&s;t Parts of our Trade are in great
Danger of being entirely lo&s;t to them, &s;uch
as the <HI>East-India, African</HI> and <HI>East</HI> Country
Trades in particular; it is apparent, if a
due Enquiry were made, we &s;hould &s;ee &s;mall
hope of continuing and pre&s;erving our In|tere&s;t
in them under a War with the <HI>Dutch;</HI>
their Collonies of &s;uperiour Strength lying
&s;o near ours in the two Fir&s;t, and their Po|tent
Alliances in the latter, enabling them
effectually to &s;upplant Us.</P>
<P>The Di&s;turbance they always upon the&s;e
Occa&s;ions gave us in our <HI>Home Trade,</HI> and the
impo&s;&s;ibility of our carrying it on, but with
<PB N="5" REF="4">
manife&s;t Di&s;advantage, is a &s;trong Argument
to open our Eyes in the Ca&s;e of a <HI>Dutch</HI> War;
there are other Parts which re&s;pect our
Coal and Salt Trade, our Corn Trade, our
<HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Lynn</HI> Carriage, our Trade to <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
and our Fi&s;hing Trade: In all which,
the Interruptions of Commerce by a <HI>Dutch</HI>
War have been &s;uch, as have been felt by
all our People.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who are &s;o fond of this
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> have perhaps not yet
examin'd the Trading Con&s;equences of it,
and as they are Landed Men, and fancy
they are no way dependent upon Trade,
they have forgotten, what &s;o often, and by
&s;o many unan&s;werable Arguments has been
proved to them, <HI>viz.</HI> That as Trade only
was the Original Cau&s;e of the encreas'd Va|lue
of Lands, and the high Rents which
now the Gentlemen receive; &s;o the decay
and ruin of Trade, mu&s;t of cour&s;e &s;ink the
Value of Land, lower the Rents, and re|duce
the Tenant, to an incapacity to &s;up|port
the Landlord; by which means, a War
will of cour&s;e affect the Landed-man as well
as the Merchant: Wherefore the Landed
Gentlemen are de&s;ired to give them&s;elves the
Trouble to enquire into the following Par|ticulars,
as they are likely to be affected by
a War with the <HI>States General.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Whether the Landed Men about
<HI>New Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> will not be effected
by the interruption of the Coal Trade? Whe|ther
when Coals are at 4 <HI>l.</HI> a Chaldron at
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>London,</HI> and on the Coa&s;ts, it will not con|&s;iderably
le&s;&s;en the Con&s;umption? And
whether in the la&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> War the Quantity
of Coals carry'd out were not le&s;&s;en'd above
50000 Chaldron in a Year?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether the Landed Men borde|ing
upon all the Coa&s;ts, from <HI>Hull</HI> in the
<HI>North,</HI> to the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and on to the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> will not be affe|cted
by the Stop put to the va&s;t Exportation
of Corn to <HI>Holland, &amp;c.</HI> the want of which
Sale, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make the Price fall
in <HI>England,</HI> by which the Tenant, not be|ing
able to get a Market for his Corn, is
di&s;abled to pay his Rent, or hold his Farm
without an Abatement?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether the Stop, put to the va&s;t
Exportation of our Woolen Manufactures to
<HI>Holland,</HI> and which will be interrupted, if
not prohibited by a War, will not ruin Mul|titudes
of our Manufacturers in the Coun|try,
leave the Poor without Employment,
and prevent or greatly le&s;&s;en, not the Con|&s;umption
of Wool only, but the General
Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions, by which the
Landed Men's E&s;tates, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be re|duced,
and their Rents remain unpaid?</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, if it was imagin'd, any
Man could object again&s;t them might be
farther enlarg'd upon, and the particular
Trades which would &s;uffer in &s;uch an Inter|ruption
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of Commerce, might be examined,
where it would appear.</P>
<P>That the great Trade of Broad Cloath,
Ker&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one of the greate&s;t Branches of
Trade in <HI>England,</HI> particularly at <HI>Leeds, Hu|thersfield,
Wakefield, Hallifax, Bradford, Roch|dale,</HI>
and the adjacent Parts, and where it is
by mode&s;t Computation &s;uppo&s;ed, Four
Hundred Thou&s;and People are employ'd and
maintained in the Woolen Manafacture,
that this great Trade is principally main|tained
and &s;upported by the Exportation to
<HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>That the Stop to that Exportation, mu&s;t
of nece&s;&s;ity encourage the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in the
Making the &s;ame kind of Goods in their own
Country, particularly at <HI>Leyden,</HI> where they
have for &s;ome Years endeavour'd it, and are
Daily improving.</P>
<P>That above Two Hundred Thou&s;and
Pound Value of the &s;aid Goods are Yearly
exported to <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>That the North-Riding of <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> Bi|&s;hoprick
of <HI>Durham,</HI> and great part of <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire,</HI>
and <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> are &s;upported, by
breeding and feeding Cattle, for the Con|&s;uption
of the <HI>West Riding;</HI> and if the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Trade receive &s;uch a Check, or Interrupti|on,
the Con&s;equence is evident; the poor
People will want Employ, which want of
Employ is immediately felt, in the Con|&s;umption
of Provi&s;ions, and that again
in the Rent of our Lands: And indeed it
cannot be a little wonder'd at, to &s;ee the
Landed Men in this Nation, value them|&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="7">
&s;o much, upon their running down
our Trade, as if the Lands had no Depen|dance
upon Trade, or that Lands cou'd hold
up their Value, if our Trade were decay'd:
This Article of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade, will &s;atisfy
any rea&s;onable Per&s;on, that it cannot be;
I pray God, we do not too fatally try the
Experiment at this time, nor is this the lea&s;t
Rea&s;on why I mention this Argument at this
time, that our Landed-Men may learn to
know what made them rich, and what may
again reduce them to what they were &s;ome
Ages ago.</P>
<P>It is true, Trade has given us no Land,
<HI>Britain</HI> is no larger than it was before; but
it is not unworthy our Thoughts, and may
be proper to recommend it to the&s;e Gentle|men
to con&s;ider, That Trade has added a
new Value to what we had before; the Rents
of Lands are ri&s;en in time to &s;uch a Degree,
that what was formerly worth 10 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI>
is now worth 100 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and what has
done this? What, but our Trade? Our Ge|neral
Commerce, which had it been more
effectually covered, encouraged and under|&s;tood,
would have been able to have done
much more.</P>
<P>Come we next to &s;peak to the <HI>Corn-Trade;</HI>
this is more &s;en&s;ibly under&s;tood by tho&s;e
Gentlemen, who&s;e E&s;tates lye near the Sea,
more particularly upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire,
York&s;hire,</HI> and the &s;everal Countries
which border upon the <HI>Humber,</HI> or on the
Navigable Rivers, emptying them&s;elves in|to
the <HI>Humber,</HI> as al&s;o upon the Coa&s;ts of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Yarmouth, Cromer, Clye, Wells,
Burnham</HI> and <HI>Lynn,</HI> the Navigations of the
River <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and the Towns of <HI>Wisbich,</HI> and
<HI>Spalding</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Ely;</HI> again, on the
Coa&s;ts of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> all which
Counties, find their Daily Advantages from
the incredible Quantity of Corn every Year
exported to <HI>Holland,</HI> without which Expor|tation,
it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the Te|nants
in tho&s;e Countries to vend the Corn
they owe, and by Con&s;equence, the Lands
in tho&s;e Counties, mu&s;t either lye unma|nur'o,
or at lea&s;t be laid down, and only em|ploy'd
in breeding of Cattle, a poor Trade
and which is now left to the <HI>Northern</HI> and
<HI>We&s;tern</HI> Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and to the <HI>Highlands</HI>
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Con&s;equence of which
would be the le&s;&s;ening the Value of Land,
&s;inking the Rents, and reducing the E&s;tates
of the Landed Men.</P>
<P>The&s;e would be &s;ome of the more imme|diate
Con&s;equences of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
and are mention'd here, becau&s;e as Mankind
are more apt to be &s;en&s;ible of that Mi&s;chief
mo&s;t, which touches them &s;oone&s;t; it can|not
but be very rea&s;onable to expect, That
the&s;e People, however at pre&s;ent unaffected
with the Danger of a War with <HI>Holland,</HI>
may think fit to change their Minds, when
they examine more &s;tricly into the thing,
and &s;hall find, that they will be immediate|ly
touch'd by it in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other immediate Ca&s;es,
in which a War with <HI>Holland</HI> will affect us,
in Matters of Trade, and which it having
<PB N="10" REF="9">
been &s;o long ago, &s;ince we had &s;uch a War,
our People are a little too apt to forget:
But which if they plea&s;e to recollect them|&s;elves,
they will find, will more nearly
touch them, than perhaps they are aware
of, as e&s;pecially the Price of Coals, touch'd
at before, which will particularly affect the
Inhabitants of this City and County's adja|cent,
where Three Pounds and Four Pounds
a Chaldron have been accounted but a mo|derate
Price for Coals, and which is occa|&s;ion'd
by the direct Situation of the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI>
who&s;e Ports immediately opening to
the North Channel, the <HI>Colliers</HI> Ships are
in ten Fold more danger from them, than
they can be from the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, in
Ca&s;e of a War with <HI>France.</HI> It is needle&s;s to en|large
how many other Trades this will affect,
how much dearer it will make all &s;uch Goods
as are wrought by Fire, but e&s;pecially how
&s;everely it will pinch the midling Families
of our Trade&s;men and the Poor, who have
no Relief in Ca&s;e of Cold Weather about
this City, there being no Woods and Forre&s;ts
as in the Country, to &s;upply them with
Fewel, and who are put to inexpre&s;&s;ible
Hard&s;hips in the Winter for want of Coal.</P>
<P>The Rates of <HI>Salt,</HI> another Nece&s;&s;ary of
Life, is a Thing de&s;erves our Con&s;ideration
in Ca&s;e of Trade; the City of <HI>London,</HI> and
all this Part of <HI>England,</HI> being &s;upply'd with
<HI>Salt</HI> from <HI>New Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> from whence
the Danger being &s;o great, the Price of
<HI>Salt</HI> was frequently in the late <HI>Dutch</HI> War,
although no Tax was then upon it, at 4 <HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HI>per</HI> Pound, and may now po&s;&s;ibly be double
that Price.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Matters of Trade, and indeed
are but a &s;mall part of what might be &s;aid
upon that Subject, but however, may &s;erve
to &s;hew, That a War with <HI>Holland</HI> can ne|ver
happen, without plunging us into many
great Difficulties, &s;uch as will ju&s;tify me in
&s;aying, That we ought never to engage in
&s;uch a War, without &s;uch an ab&s;olute and un|avoidable
Nece&s;&s;ity, as will abundantly make
the bearing all the&s;e Inconveniences ea&s;y
and rational to Us.</P>
<P>But alas! the&s;e are but the &s;maller Con&s;i|derations
in this Ca&s;e, and are mentioned here
in order to make good the fir&s;t part of
the Argument, laid down in the beginning
of this Work: The more fatal Con&s;equences
of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are &s;uch as re&s;pect
the Politick Concerns of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are of
infinite Value to Us: I &s;hall examin them
apart.</P>
<LIST>

<ITEM>II. It mu&s;t be ruinous to the <HI>Prote&s;tant In|tere&s;t.</HI></ITEM>

likely to have the Di&s;advantage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. It mu&s;t be a very bloody War, that will be

</LIST>
<P>I cannot promi&s;e to go thorow all the&s;e
effectually, in the &s;hort Compa&s;s of this
Tract: However, I &s;hall begin, and &s;peak|ing
more largely to tho&s;e which are mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall touch lightly the re&s;t,
and perhaps &s;peak more effectually to them
hereafter.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. It mu&s;t be a War in Defence of Popery.</HEAD>
<P>I know it has been argued on many Oc|ca&s;ions,
That this War was not begun on
account of <HI>Religion,</HI> it was the Argument the
<HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Advocates &s;trove to make
u&s;e of all along, &s;ubtilly to engage the Zea|lous
People the more &s;incerely in their Quar|rel,
and &s;tir them up to Blood and De&s;tru|ction:
We find many In&s;tances of this, in
the Accounts of the la&s;t few Years, e&s;peci|ally
in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter to the
<HI>Pope,</HI> relating to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who
was then newly come over to the Confede|rates,
wherein he complains of his Royal
Highne&s;s joining with <HI>Hereticks</HI> and the Ene|mies
of God's Church, meaning the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI>
and <HI>Saxe-Gotha</HI> Troops, whom he calls Ene|mies
to GOD and his Church, and which
he &s;ays they impiou&s;ly brought into <HI>Italy:</HI>
But after all that has been &s;aid on that Head,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
tho' we are not now on the Foot of a Reli|gious
War, yet if we fight with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
we certainly fight again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion
in Defence of Popery; perhaps it may
not be immediately concern'd, but it is &s;o in
its vi&s;ible Effects, and no Man can be &s;o
blind as not to &s;ee it. The Powers hereby
protected are all Popi&s;h; Popi&s;h, even to
Bigottry, e&s;pecially the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> They
have not only &s;trengthened them&s;elves
again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Religion, but by the
De&s;truction of the Prote&s;tants them&s;elves,
and that in the &s;evere&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Let any Man but take a View of them
&s;eparately <HI>in France;</HI> how has the <HI>French</HI> Go|vernor
expelled 400000 Prote&s;tants out of
their Dominions, &s;uffering all the Damages,
which the lo&s;s of &s;o many Subjects, and their
moveable E&s;tates, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be to a
Nation, rather than not to root out the
Prote&s;tant Religion; and indeed they have
rooted it out of mo&s;t part of the Nation,
and one Age of Per&s;ecution more will mo&s;t
effectually do it. How have they &s;ince pur|&s;ued
the poor Remains of the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion,
in the Mountains of the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> and
put all that have fallen into their Hands to
Death, by the cruelle&s;t Torments imagina|ble?
How have they lately done the &s;ame
in the little Principallity of <HI>Orange,</HI> tho' in
all probability they were to re&s;tore that
Country upon a Peace? In <HI>Spain,</HI> how
have we found the Aver&s;ions of the People,
to our great Damage in the War there, while
our Troops have been Maletreated by the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portegue&s;e,</HI> even while we came
there to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, rejecting their own
Deliverance, <HI>I &s;peak of tho&s;e well affected to
King</HI> Charles III. only becau&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
brought them was carry'd on by Heretick
Forces, and that the Prote&s;tants were &s;o
odious to them, that they could not bear
to be deliver'd by them. The&s;e are the
People we mu&s;t fight for, when ever we
take up Arms again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> for the&s;e
the Blood of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men and <HI>Britains</HI> is to
be &s;pilt, and the Wealth of a Prote&s;tant
Nation exhau&s;ted, and that not only for
the People of the&s;e Nations, but for their
very Religion too; could we di&s;tingui&s;h
between the Men and their Principles, be|tween
the Intere&s;t of the Nations, and the
Intere&s;t of their Religion, it were the bet|ter
to be born with: But our Ca&s;e is ex|tremly
hard, for it is not &s;o much the Na|tional
Intere&s;t, as the Religious Intere&s;t that
eventually will be the Concern of the War,
and we fight even for Popery it &s;elf:
The Propagation of the Bigottry and Su|per&s;tition
of tho&s;e Nations being &s;o twi&s;ted
with their Power, that the latter never
goes without the former, and they never
did extend their Conque&s;t and Dominions
to any Place, where they have not e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
their Idolatry and Super&s;tition, nay,
nor where they have not apply'd them&s;elves
to expunge and race out the very Name of
the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the lea&s;t Re|mains
of the Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip. This con|firms
the Head I am upon, that when ever
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the unhappy Hour &s;hall come, that the
Sword &s;hould be drawn in this Quarrel, it
is drawn by the Nature and Con&s;equence of
the Thing, in Defence of POPERY;
What Prote&s;tant then can think of this with|out
Horror? How ruinous mu&s;t this be to
the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t! How de&s;tructive to
the Safety of Religion, to the Freedom of
Con&s;cience, and to the Pro&s;perity of the
Churches abroad! <HI>Of which by it &s;elf;</HI> but
particularly, how dreadful a Work mu&s;t
this be for Prote&s;tants to do? With what
Face can any Man, who is a Profe&s;&s;or of
the Prote&s;tant Religion, draw his Sword in
&s;uch a Quarrel? And which is &s;till wor&s;e,
how can any Prote&s;tant put his Hand to the
contriving and bringing to pa&s;s &s;uch a War.
I have no Hand in, or Eye towards, who is,
or is not concern'd in the Mea&s;ures that have
a Tendency to this; &s;ome &s;ay one &s;ide are
guilty of it, &s;ome the other, and both
&s;eem to agree that it will be a Con&s;equence
of what is now doing; but I am de&s;irous
faithfully to repre&s;ent to both Sides, what
the meaning of a War with <HI>Holland</HI> is, what
it implies, and what Effects will nece&s;&s;arily
follow, that both Parties may lay their
Hands upon their Hearts, and reflect with
Seriou&s;ne&s;s what they are about, when they
draw their Swords again&s;t their Brethren.</P>

<HEAD>II. It mu&s;t be ruinous to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>This is little more than the Rever&s;e of the
other as to the part of Religion, becau&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="15">
the Defence of Popery mu&s;t be the Ruin, or

but I choo&s;e to call this the <HI>Prote&s;tant
Intere&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e tho' the Religious Intere&s;t
depends upon it, and mu&s;t follow the Fate
of it upon all Occa&s;ions, yet the Civil and
Politick Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tants, is what
I am now &s;peaking of, and how far the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e will affect it will &s;oon appear:
Nothing is more evident, than that the King|doms
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Con|junction
with the States General, are the
main Strength of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in
the World. The Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> with
the Kings of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> are con&s;i|derable,
it is true, and not at all to be de|&s;pi&s;ed;
but alas! how long would all the&s;e,
put together, be able to &s;upport the Prote|&s;tant
Cau&s;e, or to defend them&s;elves again&s;t
the Power of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Popery!
How &s;oon would the Light of the Prote|&s;tant
Religion in the World be extingui&s;hed,
if the Popi&s;h Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> were com|bin'd
again&s;t tho&s;e few Northern Provinces!
But the Center of Prote&s;tant Strength lies
in the joint Forces, Power and Wealth of
the Two Maritime Potentates, <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> their Forces by Land have alone
been able to match the Popi&s;h Powers of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and to look the King of <HI>France</HI> in the
Face, and their United Force at Sea is ac|knowledg'd
to be &s;uperiour to all the known
World, tho' all their Naval Strength was put
together.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
Upon this Strength the Prote&s;tant Inte|re&s;t,
&s;peaking of &s;econd Cau&s;es entirely de|pends,
this makes the Prote&s;tants formi|dable
to the World; this alone has re|&s;train'd
the Popi&s;h Powers of the World
from over-running them many Ages ago:
Farther than this, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary
to reflect, what Blows the Prote&s;tant Inte|re&s;t
has already received in the&s;e 20 or 30
Years pa&s;t, how much weaker it is by Con|&s;equence
than it was before, and thereby
how unable to re&s;i&s;t the Effects of new
Enemies, if join'd together; much
more, how little need there is to have
yet deeper Wounds made in their Intere&s;t,
than was before: The&s;e things are evident
in the following Particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Extirpation of the Prote&s;tants of
<HI>France.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Succe&s;&s;ion of the Roman Catho|lick
Hou&s;e of <HI>Newburgh</HI> to the <HI>Pala|tinate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The going over of the Elector of <HI>Saxo|ny</HI>
to the Romi&s;h Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The weakening and oppre&s;&s;ing the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and dive&s;ting the <HI>Swedes</HI>
(who are Guarrantees of the Treaty of
<HI>We&s;tphalia</HI>) of their Dominions in the
Empire.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Danger of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or to
the Crowns of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In con&s;idering the&s;e Things, what Re|flections
mu&s;t needs follow to any one, who
<PB N="18" REF="17">
with an impartial Eye, and a ju&s;t Concern
for the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, can look on the
approaching Danger of a bloody War be|tween
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and the <HI>States General;</HI>
what a mortal Wound this would be to the
Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, What a Breach it would
make in the Prote&s;tant Strength, and how
effectually it would expo&s;e the Prote&s;tant
Cau&s;e to be over-run by the Arms and In|tere&s;t
of the Popi&s;h Princes, who we have
always found ready to devour them.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who want Examples to illu&s;trate
this, look back upon the Year 1672, when
this Nation gull'd by the Arts and Politicks
of Popi&s;h Councils, was drawn in to fight
again&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI> How did it open a way
to all tho&s;e terrible Conque&s;ts, which the
<HI>French</HI> King made upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by which
he was within a Trifle of di&s;&s;olving their
State, and uniting them all to the Kingdom
of <HI>France,</HI> and by which we had like at that
time to have overwhelm'd the Prote&s;tant
Religion in the World? And in a Word, by
which this Nation al&s;o was at la&s;t brought
to &s;uch a De&s;perate Point, that had not
the Revolution fallen in to re&s;cue us from
the Danger, we had fallen into the Ballance
of Power on the Popi&s;h Side, and had
help'd to outweigh the Prote&s;tants, to their
univer&s;al De&s;truction: This may &s;erve to
warn us all from falling into the like Blind|ne&s;s
of Mea&s;ures, and nothing is more won|derful,
than to find our People &s;o willing to
run into it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
What can our falling upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> at
this time imply? What can the Effect of it
be? Will it not be an immediate weakening
of them in their Defence of the Prote&s;tant
Religion, and a direct &s;trengthing their Ene|mies
to de&s;troy them? And will it not be
an effectual weakening of us al&s;o, &s;o as at
la&s;t perhaps to render us both too weak to
do that, tho' join'd together, which either
of us are able to do now apart, in Defence
of what is the mutual Intere&s;t of both?</P>
<P>Add to this how both Nations are al|ready
exhau&s;ted, and emptied by the long
and continu'd Burthen of this heavy and ex|pen&s;ive
War, that as it has been the&s;e 22
Years dreining us, it will require twice that
time at lea&s;t to re&s;tore and recover us: So
that we are in a much wor&s;e Condition
to wa&s;te one another farther; &s;ince it
will of cour&s;e &s;o entirely expend our Strength
and Capacity for our mutual Defence, that
it mu&s;t render both Sides an ea&s;ie Prey to
the Enemy, as is happily expre&s;s'd by the
Fable of the two &s;mall Birds, who having
been long fighting together, the Eagle
came and &s;natch'd away both.</P>
<P>Let every con&s;idering Prote&s;tant &s;ummon
his Rea&s;on, and in the mo&s;t affectionate man|ner
per&s;uade the Nations, if it be po&s;&s;ible,
to avoid &s;o dangerous a Step as this, which
has a direct Tendency to de&s;troy the Pro|te&s;tant
Intere&s;t in the World, and which
cuts off the Hands that &s;hould defend it; let
them con&s;ider how the Enemies of our Re|ligion
would rejoice; how they would pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="19">
them&s;elves from the&s;e Divi&s;ions and
Di&s;tractions among Prote&s;tants, that one
time or other they &s;hould break in and de|vour
the whole Intere&s;t; let them remem|ber
that the like Strife among Chri&s;tians,
was the very thing that let <HI>Mahomet</HI> the
Great into <HI>Europe,</HI> and gave lei&s;ure and op|portunity
to the Barbarians, to overthrow
the Remains of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire, take
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and plant them&s;elves and their
<HI>Pagan</HI> Super&s;tition on the Ruins of the flou|ri&s;hing
Chri&s;tian Churehes: This was the
time the famous City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> was
taken, and the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> &s;lain in it,
after a long Siege by the <HI>Turks:</HI> Not one of
the Chri&s;tian Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ending the
lea&s;t Help, or &s;tirring one Foot to the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Chri&s;tian Emperor, who lo&s;t
his Life in the Storm of the City; not that
the Chri&s;tian Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> were not
able to have reliev'd the City, and to have
driven the <HI>Turk</HI> out of <HI>Europe,</HI> but they were
univer&s;ally embroil'd in furious Wars again&s;t
one another, <HI>France</HI> was ju&s;t re&s;cuing its &s;elf
out of the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under the
weak and divided Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> 6th; and
<HI>Germany</HI> was embroil'd in Wars between the
Emperor <HI>Fredrick</HI> and the Pope, by which
Means every Hand was employ'd, and that
Power which &s;hould have protected the Chri|&s;tian
Intere&s;t was weaken'd to that Degree,
that the Chri&s;tians were in no Condition to
oppo&s;e the victorious <HI>Turks,</HI> but let them
quietly over-run a great part of <HI>Europe.</HI> I
would have all tho&s;e, who are de&s;irous of
<PB N="21" REF="20">
engaging the&s;e two <HI>Prote&s;tant Nations,</HI> in a
War one with another, read that melan|choly
Story, and con&s;ider how exactly this
would be the Ca&s;e, between <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and
<HI>Prote&s;tants:</HI> Let them con&s;ider, what De|predations
the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe</HI>
would make on the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Princes du|ring
&s;uch a time: Let them examin in
what Po&s;ture we &s;hould be to protect the
<HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Intere&s;t, in Ca&s;e of any Excur&s;ion
of its <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Enemies; how it would le&s;&s;en
the Figure the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> now make, weaken
their Hands, render them Contemptible to
their Enemies, and lay them open to the
Attempts of tho&s;e, who have been hitherto
re&s;trained only by fear, from devouring
them.</P>
<P>3. Nor would Victory on either hand
mend it, for the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t being
coucerned, but as one Body in the whole
Quarrel would equally &s;uffer, which Side
&s;oever obtained the Victory; and this leads
me to the Third Head, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. It must be a War, in which the greatest

<P>It will be to no purpo&s;e for any Side to

Strength, one Intere&s;t, and one Foundation
upon which they &s;tand; it is very unhappy
that the&s;e things cannot pierce a little into
our Thoughts, but that we are all intent at
&s;uch a time as this, either on pu&s;hing on a
War, or &s;ettling a particular Peace, and leaving
the Views and Pro&s;pects of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>Europe,</HI>
we are turning our Eyes upon a Breach with

to do with who <HI>directly,</HI> or who <HI>con|&s;equently</HI>
pu&s;h on a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but
directing my Speech to both Parties, I would
faithfully repre&s;ent to them, the Ruin and
Di&s;tre&s;s that &s;uch a War would bring upon
the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> in general; how
which Side &s;oever get the better, <HI>Popery</HI>
alone gains by the Victory; every Battle
fought weakens the very Conqueror as <HI>Pro|te&s;tant,</HI>
as much as it does tho&s;e that are
beaten: This is what I would move them
to do, that they may if po&s;&s;ible find out
&s;ome happy Medium, either on one Side or
other; I do not undertake here to &s;ay what,

the giving up the <HI>Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e</HI> to be de|voured
by the <HI>Popi&s;h Tyrants</HI> of the World;
that <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> may not whet their Swords
again&s;t one another, as they already do
their Tongues in a Dreadful and Implaca|ble
manner; That they would remember
every Drop of Blood they &s;hed in this Quar|rel,
leaves them ju&s;t &s;o much the le&s;s to op|po&s;e
again&s;t <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Power, when that Day
<PB N="23" REF="22">
&s;hall come, <HI>as undoubtedly it will,</HI> when the
Fate of the whole <HI>Prote&s;tant Interest</HI> may be
try'd by the Sword, and the Forces of all
<HI>Europe</HI> &s;hall be divided in a <HI>Religious War;</HI> I
can compare this unhappy Ca&s;e of a War,
between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to nothing &s;o
well, as to the War between the Children
of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> again&s;t their Brethren of the Tribe
of <HI>Benjamin.</HI></P>
<P>This is remarkable for the fury of it, as ap|pears
in the Tribes Swearing, binding one
another by an Oath, or a great Oath as the
Text hath it, That every Man that came
not up to the Lord at <HI>Mizpeth,</HI> that is, to
fight again&s;t <HI>Benjamin,</HI> &s;hould be put to
Death; and another Oath they had al&s;o
made, <HI>viz.</HI> That they would not any of
them give their Daughters to a <HI>Benjamite.</HI></P>
<P>The Story is too well known to repeat
the Particulars, the War was carry'd on with
great Fury, and was very bloody, as &s;uch
Wars always are; it was &s;o bloody that
they &s;pared neither Age, Sex or Condition,
no, nor the very Cattle; but burnt down
all their Cities, and all that came to hand,
<HI>Judg.</HI> 20. 48. So that the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin</HI>
was entirely cut off, only Six Hundred Men
being left alive of the whole Race: And
what Joy had <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of this Victory! they had
no &s;ooner done it, but &s;ee the Title or Con|tents
of the next Chapter. <HI>The People bewail
the De&s;olation of Benjamin:</HI> vide Mr. <HI>Pool</HI>'s An|notations
and Contents, on <HI>Judges</HI> xxi.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Next &s;ee the manner of their bewailing it.</P>
<P><HI>And the People came to the Hou&s;e of God, and a|bode
there till even before God, and lift up their
voices, and wept &s;ore: And &s;aid, O LORD
God of I&s;rael, why is this come to pa&s;s in I&s;rael,
that there &s;honld be to day one Tribe lacking in
I&s;rael? And it came to pa&s;s, on the morrow, that
the People ro&s;e early, and built there an Altar,
and offered Burnt Offerings, and Peace Offerings.</HI></P>
<P>And again, <HI>v.</HI> 6. <HI>And the Children of I&s;rael
repented them for Benjamin their Brother, and
&s;aid, There is one tribe cut off from I&s;rael this
Day.</HI></P>
<P>See here the mournful Satisfaction of Vi|ctory
over our Friends! what is the Engli&s;h
of it but this, <HI>There is one Tribe cut off from I&s;|rael?</HI>
That is, &s;hould <HI>we now</HI> be invaded by the
<HI>Heathen,</HI> by the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> or
the <HI>Midianites,</HI> or any of the Barbarous Na|tions;
there is one Tribe le&s;s, to help de|fend
the Borders of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> Our Brethren of
<HI>Benjamin</HI> are cut off, and we are left naked
on that Side, we are ju&s;t &s;o much the weaker
by our Victory.</P>
<P>How exactly does this an&s;wer to the
Ca&s;e before us? Should either Side prevail,
&s;hould we beat, &s;hould we conquer the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
&s;hould the Heathen (<HI>French</HI>) fall in upon
them, and over-run them entirely, <HI>as in</HI> 1672
<HI>they had almo&s;t done, by our infatuated A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI>
what would be our Joy in this Conque&s;ts?
Should we not reflect on our &s;elves after it,
and <HI>repent our &s;elves for Benjamin?</HI> Should we
not &s;ay, <HI>why is this come to pa&s;s among</HI> Prote|&s;tants,
<HI>that a Tribe or Nation of</HI> Prote&s;tants <HI>is</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
<HI>now lacking in I&s;rael?</HI> Should we not lament
for <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that a Tribe was cut off from
the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Strength?</P>
<P>On the other Hand, &s;hould this War fall
heavy on Us, and though Ruin is what we
pretend not to fear, yet might it not &s;o
weaken us, as to expo&s;e us an ea&s;y Prey to
the <HI>Pretender</HI> and his Party, which would
be the wor&s;t &s;ort of Ruin; would not the
<HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves, and the whole Body of
the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Europe, Bewail the De&s;olati|on
of Benjamin,</HI> and repent them for having
lo&s;t a Tribe from the <HI>Prote&s;tant I&s;rael?</HI></P>
<P>Let all tho&s;e, as well of one Side or other,
who are either ha&s;ty for, or indifferent in
the Ca&s;e of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> look into
the&s;e Things, and con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what
they are doing; con&s;ider the Con&s;equence
of a War, in which, whether conquering
or conquered, the Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant

<HEAD>V. It mu&s;t be a War fatal many ways to Us,
who are engag'd in it.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
This, be&s;ides what relates as before to
the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and the <HI>Hannover</HI>
Succe&s;&s;ion, will be con&s;ider'd, as it re&s;pects
our Commerce, our publick Credit, our ex|hau&s;ted
Circum&s;tances, and our general Ci|vil
Intere&s;t; what relates to Commerce, has
been touch'd at already, and I may only
add this, that as our Trade in general
is already prodigiou&s;ly &s;unk, by the long
Interruption of 22 Years War; the Damage
of which will not in &s;ome Ages, <HI>if Ever,</HI> be
wholly repair'd; So a War with <HI>Holland</HI> at
this time, would give &s;uch a Blow to that
Part which remains, that in general our
whole Trade would be overwhelmed in Dif|ficulties
and Confu&s;ions inextricable; the
Employment of the Poor, by the Stop and
Interruption of Commerce in the pre&s;ent
Wars, has in &s;everal Parts of <HI>England</HI> been
quite &s;topt, in others they are taken off of the
Manufactures they were originally bred to. So
that whole Towns remain now De&s;titute of
&s;o much as the appearance of tho&s;e Ma|nufactures
they were formerly wholly ta|ken
up with; our Colonies Abroad, by the
&s;top of the Con&s;umption and Exportation of
their Produce, occa&s;ion'd by the War, are
oblig'd to leave Planting, as in <HI>Virginia</HI> in
particular, and apply them&s;elves to Manu|factures,
by which in a few Years the &s;up|ply
of Woollen Manufactures, which u&s;ual|ly
was &s;ent from hence, will be effectually
&s;topp'd. All the&s;e and many more will be
encrea&s;ed by a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to whom,
including <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> at this time, we ex|port
<PB N="30" REF="29">
more of our Woolen, Manufactures than
to all Parts of the World be&s;ides, tho' put
together.</P>
<P>What then &s;hall be the Condition of our
People, when as before the Export of our
Broad Cloth, Ker&s;ies, Serges and Stuffs, of
which the <HI>Dutch</HI> now receive &s;uch great
Quantities &s;hall be &s;top'd, and when the
poor People, who now live upon tho&s;e Em|ployments,
&s;hall be de&s;titute of Work, and
be left to &s;eek their Bread? Let tho&s;e
People that think a War with <HI>Holland</HI> of no
Con&s;equence, con&s;ider of &s;ome Equivalent
for this, and of opening &s;ome Trade for
the vent of our Manufactures, which &s;hall
&s;ufficiently &s;upply the Poor with Labour,
and rai&s;e Money effectually to pay them.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things were con&s;ider'd, we &s;hould
be more cautious, as well of coveting to
make a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as of plea&s;ing
our &s;elves with the Hopes that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
will force us to it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not touch at the Con&s;equences,
which &s;ome have already &s;poken to, in ca&s;e
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> pu&s;hing on the
War without Us, &s;hould reduce <HI>France,</HI> and
and recover <HI>Spain,</HI> not only without any A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
from Us, but even again&s;t our Will,
the many ways this may be fatal to Us, are
better thought of in private, than made pub|lick,
and it is hoped the Prudence of our Al|lies
may avoid pu&s;hing us to tho&s;e Extreme|ties:
But I cannot omit mentioning again,
tho' &s;poken to before, how evidently &s;uch a
War would open a Door to <HI>the Pretender,</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="30">
expo&s;e the&s;e Nations, as a Prey to the <HI>Jaco|bite</HI>
Intere&s;t, as well at Home as Abroad; for
as &s;ome Men hope, &s;o I cannot but &s;ee, that
in ca&s;e of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the At|tempts
of the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> will be inevita|ble;
nor can they be &s;o blind to their own
Intere&s;t, as not to know it; and this is the
true Rea&s;on, that you cannot conver&s;e at
this Time with a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> but you di&s;cover
his mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire of a War with the
<HI>Dutch;</HI> all their Emi&s;&s;aries are bu&s;ie, Ex|claiming
again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Exa&s;perating
our People again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and if the <HI>States-General</HI>
do &s;tand out again&s;t the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mea|&s;ures,
or take any Step that &s;eems a little di&s;|obliging,
the&s;e Men, far from doing Ju&s;tice
on either Hand, &s;et all their Emi&s;&s;aries at
Work, to aggravate it, and make it appear
wor&s;e than really it is: On the other Hand,
the &s;ame Party in <HI>Holland</HI> act the very other
Extreme, and there they exclaim again&s;t the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ures, tell the <HI>Dutch</HI> they are Mal|treated,
that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament has u&s;ed
them barbarou&s;ly; That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try
impo&s;e upon them, and cram the Peace down
their Throats, and the like: The Rea&s;on is
evident, they &s;eek nothing but a Breach, be|cau&s;e
they &s;ee clearly that a War is the only
Step that can make way for their Intere&s;t,
and open a Door to the Pretender.</P>

<HEAD>VI. It mu&s;t be a War again&s;t the General Incli|nation
of the People.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
This &s;eems to want no Proof, even the
Queen her&s;elf and the Mini&s;try, however it
may &s;eem, are aver&s;e to it, and the Mea&s;ures ta|ken
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> however Calculated to
carry on the Peace with the <HI>French,</HI> have
plainly di&s;cover'd, that it is not the Inclination
of the Mini&s;try to break with the <HI>Dutch</HI> if
they can avoid it; they cannot but &s;ee, that
it will be <HI>Ruinous to our Trade,</HI> and that the
<HI>Burthens</HI> mu&s;t be intollerable that mu&s;t follow,
e&s;pecially our pre&s;ent Impoveri&s;h'd Circum|&s;tances
con&s;ider'd: Nor can it be Rea&s;ona|ble,
that the Mini&s;try, who give the Ex|hau&s;ted
Condition of the Nation, as the be&s;t
and fir&s;t Rea&s;on for making a Peace with
<HI>France,</HI> &s;hould at the &s;ame Time be &s;o re|gardle&s;s
of that exhau&s;ted Condition of the
Nation, as to lead them into a War with
<HI>Holland;</HI> this would be to deny what they
had alledg'd before, and Contradict what
was the main Argument given, for Convin|cing
us of the Nece&s;&s;ity of former Mea&s;ures,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Nation was Reduced, Exhau|&s;ted,
Impoveri&s;h'd, and the like, and that
&s;ome Ages were requir'd to re&s;tore our Cir|cum&s;tances,
and this was acknowledg'd in
many Ca&s;es to be true; but the People
will, of cour&s;e think them&s;elves banter'd and
je&s;ted with in all that, if we think fit now
to run into another War, which may be e|very
way as fatal and as chargeable as the
other.</P>
<P>As to the Inclination of the common Peo|ple,
that has many Ways been try'd, the
Aver&s;ions that formerly were in our People
<PB N="33" REF="32">
again&s;t a <HI>Dutch</HI> War, were too well known
to tho&s;e who ob&s;erv'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> with what
Backwardne&s;s they Engag'd! with what Re|luctance
they Li&s;ted! how the poor Seamen
were dragg'd into the Service, like a Bear
to the Stake! It would be too long to enter
upon the Rea&s;ons and Con&s;iderations which
moved this Aver&s;ion, the Thing &s;peaks it&s;elf;
they have been long our Friends and Con|federates,
have often A&s;&s;i&s;ted, Relieved, De|liver'd
Us in our Embroiled Circum&s;tances,
and we cannot without Reluctance, de&s;ire
to fight again&s;t a People whom we have &s;o
often acted in Conjunction with: We have
look'd upon them as our Friends, as our Bre|thren,
in the late War, and it mu&s;t be with
Regret, that our People &s;hould rejoyce in
contrary Extremes, and &s;heath their Swords
in the Bowels of tho&s;e, who they &s;hook
Hands with before.</P>
<P>Trade, our mutual Conver&s;e in Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and the long Interwoven Intere&s;ts of the
two Nations, cannot but Contribute to this
Inclination; and the Damage we &s;hall feel,
and that immediately too, will a&s;&s;i&s;t to form
the Aver&s;ions which are in our Minds again&s;t
the War, and make our People abhorr the
Thoughts of it; but I need not in&s;i&s;t upon
this, which every Man knows to be Fact,
and can trace the Original of; I come now
to con&s;ider the two la&s;t Articles, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<PB N="34" REF="33">
<HEAD>VII. That it will be a War, in which we are
very likely to have the Di&s;advantage.</HEAD>
<P>Not that I am of the Opinion that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> will beat Us, as &s;ome People talk, and
yet farther from plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the
Hopes of it, as &s;ome pretend we do; but if,
as before, we &s;hall be Lo&s;ers, even by the
Succe&s;s we may pretend to have in it, what
then mu&s;t be the want of that Succe&s;s, if &s;uch
a Ca&s;e al&s;o &s;hould happen? Let tho&s;e who
calmly Examin Things at all, look back on
the Stop of Trade, Lo&s;s of Shipping, Ruin
of Merchants, want of Employ for our Peo|ple;
mention'd before in this Tract, and judge
for them&s;elves, as to the Advantages to Us;
but if we &s;hould have the wor&s;t of it at Sea
al&s;o, as no Man can An&s;wer for the uncer|tain
Events of War; if our Navy &s;hould be
Defeated, our Ships, which are our Strength,
receive any fatal Blow, which we are not
&s;ure of the Di&s;advantages which will follow
to us, are &s;uch, as I &s;hall, in hopes they will
never happen, conceal for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> No more &s;hall I think to terrifie any
from a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by telling them
it will not be a War to be Trifled with; that
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> when they u&s;ed to meet
at Sea, do not u&s;e to make a Je&s;t of it; fight|ing
with the <HI>Dutch</HI> has always had a diffe|rence
in it from fighting with other Nations:
The&s;e fight at a di&s;tance, and lie and pelt one
another, while they are a quarter of a Mile
or half a Mile off, or pour in their &s;mall
<PB N="35" REF="34">
Shot upon one another, to pick off their
Men; but when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> for|merly
u&s;ed to meet, three Sea fights have been
fought with near 80 Sail of a &s;ide in one
Summer, the great 3 Deck Ships of 100 Guns
each, &s;ink and burn by one another's Side,
and the Squadrons lie Yard-Arm and Yard-Arm,
pouring in their Cro&s;s-Bar, Double
Head and Round, and tearing one another
with that dreadful Fury, that nothing on
Earth can be &s;poken of, to de&s;cribe tho&s;e
Sea fights by; let tho&s;e who remember the
la&s;t <HI>Holland</HI> Wars, tell us, whether the hot|te&s;t
Action we have had at Sea during this
War, can be compar'd to the Way of fighting
between Us and the <HI>Dutch?</HI> And there is no
Que&s;tion to be made but the like mu&s;t follow
again, if a New War begin; This &s;eems evi|dent,
that the Animo&s;ity between the Nati|ons,
is like to be as great as ever, and per|haps
greater; and the War, if &s;uch a mi&s;e|rable
Event &s;hould follow, will be Pro&s;ecu|ted
with the greate&s;t Fury that any War e|ver
was between Us.</P>
<P>Having thus laid down the Con&s;equences
of &s;uch a War, it cannot be thought that
any one in the&s;e Nations, who is a Friend
to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, to the Prote|&s;tant
Religion, to the general Intere&s;t of
the Prote&s;tant Powers, to Trade, to the Poor,
or indeed to them&s;elves, can de&s;ire to have
the&s;e two Prote&s;tant Nations engag'd with
one another, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a Time as
this. It is an invidious Task to go about here
to make Enquiry who are, or are not de&s;i|rous
of this War? Or who among us may,
<PB N="36" REF="35">
by pu&s;hing on their &s;eparate Schemes, bring
it to pa&s;s by the Con&s;equence of the&s;e
Schemes, whether involuntarily or other|wi&s;e,
it is too evident where this lies, to
need an Enquiry, but as I have made this
Piece hitherto independent, and look nei|ther
way, as to Parties, &s;o it &s;eems not at
all needful: The Advice is to both, or all
our Parties, that they would con&s;ider very
well what they are doing, what Intere&s;t
they are carrying on; who&s;e alone will be
the Advantage; to whom will be the Joy
of &s;uch a War: For if the&s;e are our Dan|gers,
and if all the&s;e Di&s;advantages threaten
us by a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it cannot be,
but that a Proportion of Gain and Advan|tage
will accrue to the Enemy, for what is
our Lo&s;s, mu&s;t on the other Hand be their
Advantage.</P>
<P>I know, and ea&s;ily fore&s;ee many Things
will be objected here, and it may be nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;peak to them all in their Order,
tho' our Space at the end of this Work is
too &s;hort, to &s;ay all that might be &s;poken&mdash;The
Objections are &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho'
it be true, that the Con&s;equences of a War
with <HI>Holland,</HI> are, as you have &s;aid, yet
what mu&s;t be done? We are not to let the
<HI>Dutch</HI> in&s;ult us, becau&s;e it is our Di&s;advan|tage
&s;o many ways to have War. That if
the <HI>Dutch</HI> reject the Mea&s;ures propo&s;ed for
their Advantage, and Ours too, and car|ry
Things on to an extravagant Height,
THEY force the War and not WE: That
by doing what is incompatible with our
<PB N="37" REF="36">
Intere&s;t, they in Effect declare the War; &s;o
that it is They make War with the QUEEN,
not the QUEEN with Them: That the
<HI>Dutch</HI> are acted by a Faction from hence,
who prompt and per&s;uade them to &s;tand
out, and put them in hopes, that their do|ing
&s;o, may bring Things to a new Turn
here, and put a new Face upon our Affairs,
and that all the&s;e Things pu&s;h the pre&s;ent
Mini&s;try upon the nece&s;&s;ity of taking the
Mea&s;ures they now pur&s;ue, to pre&s;erve the
pre&s;ent Government; and if the <HI>Dutch</HI> join
with a Party here, who oppo&s;e Her Ma|je&s;ty's
ju&s;t Mea&s;ures, they bring the War
upon them&s;elves, and that Party here are the
Cau&s;e, and ought to bear the Blame of the
War, and of all the Inconveniences and Da|mages
that may follow.</P>
<P>It is not my Work here to argue for or
again&s;t the Parties, as I &s;aid before, I am
rather for giving all the Latitude to the
Objectors on either Hand, and therefore I
willingly, for Arguments-&s;ake, allow all
the Objection; but without entring into the
Merit of the Ca&s;e on the one Side, or the
Other, the Con&s;equences of the War, not
the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, is the pre&s;ent Argument
before us.</P>
<P>If there is a nece&s;&s;ity for a War with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> I am &s;orry for that unhappy Circum|&s;tance;
but without entring into a Di&s;pute of
the Fact, my Draught of the Con&s;equences
lies as a Caution to all Parties to con&s;ider,
with the utmo&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s, what that Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
is, and if po&s;&s;ible to remove tho&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Cau&s;es, which bring that Nece&s;&s;ity on; for
if the Effects of a <HI>Dutch</HI> War are as before, we
ought to be very well &s;atisfy'd, that our Rea|&s;ons
for it are of &s;ufficient Weight to ballance
all the Evils that follow; and if on a due
Enquiry it &s;hould be found that the&s;e Nece&s;|&s;ities
are of our own making, and that we
maliciou&s;ly on both Sides pu&s;h one another
on to the Extremities, which in their own
nature procure this Mi&s;chief. The Excu&s;e
of its being nece&s;&s;ary will dwindle away
into, and plainly di&s;cover, a wicked Plot to
bring this War upon the Nation, even
for the &s;ake of tho&s;e very Mi&s;chiefs that
&s;o nece&s;&s;arily attend it.</P>
<P>As to letting the <HI>Dutch</HI> in&s;ult us, and put|ting
the Cau&s;e of the War wholly upon
them; if this were true, or &s;hould appear,
all that has been &s;aid will lye again&s;t the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and not again&s;t Us, and were I to
write this in <HI>Holland,</HI> I would perhaps be
able to &s;hew the <HI>Dutch,</HI> how many ways a
War with <HI>Britain</HI> may be fatal and dange|rous
to them, as well as to us Us: Many of
the Arguments before-mention'd, hold good
on their Side, as well as Ours. The <HI>Hanno|ver</HI>
Succe&s;&s;ion is, tho' &s;omething more re|motely,
as much their Concern as Ours;
the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t ought to lie as near
their Hearts as ours. The Interruptions of
Commerce, the Lo&s;s of Ships, Trade and
Goods; The&s;e are Things they will bear
their &s;hare of, no Que&s;tion with us: If
they gain by the War; if they Beat us,
they will have as much Cau&s;e to mourn for
<PB N="39" REF="38">
their Victory as We for our Lo&s;s; and as
the Author of the <HI>Review</HI> &s;ays very well,
<Q REND="inline">"The whole War is but the &s;ame thing
as a Man cutting off his Left Hand with
his Right."</Q></P>
<P>The Advice is to them therefore, <HI>equally
as to us,</HI> tho' not quite with the &s;ame Con|cern;
they ought to &s;tudy all the Methods
po&s;&s;ible to avoid this Breach; they ought to
con&s;ider and duly weigh the General Prote|&s;tant
Intere&s;t, and rather abate in &s;ome of their
Demands for Peace-&s;ake, and to avoid the
threatning Danger: In &s;hort, both Nations,
and every Party or Faction in both Nations,
ought to con&s;ider well what they are doing,
and to what a de&s;perate Condition the Pro|te&s;tant
Intere&s;t will be reduced, and nothing
but &s;uch unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity as will ju&s;tify
them before God and Man, ought to be
allow'd as a Rea&s;on for this War.</P>
<P>I might de&s;cend here to other Particu|lars,
but as they &s;eem to lead more directly
into our pre&s;ent Party Di&s;putes, which
in this Tract, I purpo&s;e not to meddle
with, I omit them, and choo&s;e to let this
Animadver&s;ion re&s;pect every Side, that
if po&s;&s;ible it may be u&s;eful to them all; and
may bring all Parties &s;eriou&s;ly to apply
them&s;elves, if po&s;&s;ible, to heal this Breach
now while it is young, and before the
Wound fe&s;ters, before it comes up to an In|flamation
and Mortification, when all the
Endeavours will but encrea&s;e the Mi&s;ery,
and be ineffectual to the Cure.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
It is our pre&s;ent Misfortune, that our
People on both Sides &s;eem not to &s;ee into
the Mi&s;chiefs of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the
Willingne&s;s on one Hand, and the Uncon|cernedne&s;s
at the Con&s;equences on the other,
which unhappily appear among our People
with re&s;pect to a War with <HI>Holland</HI> are very
&s;urprizing, and it &s;eems to me to &s;ignify, that
neither of the Parties have duly weigh'd the
thing: The&s;e Sheets are written, that they
may not want a Light to &s;ee by in this Ca&s;e,
nor plead Ignorance of the Effects, when
they may have brought them upon us too
late.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who profe&s;s it their De&s;ign to
overthrow the pre&s;ent Settlement of this
Nation, I mean the Enemies of the <HI>Revolu|tion,</HI>
the Friends of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the favou|rers
of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny;</HI> the&s;e Sheets are
not written for their Conviction, I do not
&s;o much reproach them with de&s;iring a
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> becau&s;e it &s;eems the
only way to bring all their De&s;ires to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But this may be drawn from thence as a
mo&s;t direct Con&s;equence, <HI>viz.</HI> That the pre|&s;ent
Popular Cry again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> is a &s;ad
Token of the Growth and Encrea&s;e of
<HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> among Us, and of the growing
Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
