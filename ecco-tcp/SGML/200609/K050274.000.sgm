<HEAD>AN
Impartial Acccount, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT was many Years ago &s;ince
the <HI>French</HI> Court regretted
very much the hight of the
Publick Credit in <HI>England,</HI>
they look'd upon it as the Great, and
perhaps the only Advantage that <HI>Eng|land</HI>
had over them in the War, Name|ly,
That by the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Reputa|tation
of the Publick Funds here, and
the Authority of Parliamentary Credit,
whatever Sum of Money was Voted
in <HI>England,</HI> tho' the Funds did not
produce it in many Years, and tho' the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Loans were prodigiou&s;lp Great, yet the
Pnblick could command the Money in
a few Days, perhaps in a few Hours,
Five and twenty Hundred Thou&s;and
Pound Sterling, an Immen&s;e Sum told
out into <HI>French</HI> Livres, has been Sub|&s;crib'd
to the Engraftment of the Bank
in a few Hours: Lotteries of a Million
have been fill'd before the Lottery it
&s;elf could be pa&s;s'd in Parliament, and
before it could be Imagin'd po&s;&s;ible to
Crowd into the Office, the Tickets
have been all Sub&s;crib'd, and the Mony
all immediately paid in.</P>
<P>This was as much the Terror of our
Neighbours, as it was the Honour and
Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> and Foreigners
have been heard to &s;ay, That there was
no getting the better of <HI>England</HI> by Bat|tle,
No, tho' Victory was always on their
&s;ide. That while we had thus an inex|hau&s;tible
Storehou&s;e of Money, no &s;u|periority
in the Field, could be a Match
for this &s;uperiority of Trea&s;ure; for
Money being the Ba&s;is of the War, in
the Modern way of carrying &s;uch things
on in the World, it had long &s;ince been
a receiv'd Maxim in the Ca&s;e of War,
That the longe&s;t Pur&s;e, not the longe&s;t
Sword, would be &s;ure to Conquer at
<PB N="3" REF="4">
la&s;t: As in two Mens Boxing, not al|ways
he that had the &s;tronge&s;t Arm,
but he that had the longe&s;t Breath,
would be &s;ure to have the better of
his Enemy.</P>
<P>It was in vain that the late King of
<HI>France,</HI> tho' he had an Ab&s;olute Com|mand
of the Greate&s;t, and at fir&s;t the
Wealthie&s;t Nation in the World, tryed
all the Methods, all the Arts that hu|man
Wit could Invent to rai&s;e a Fund
of Credit in his Kingdom, and could
never bring it to pa&s;s; the whole
Council of <HI>France</HI> could never dictate
to him the Method how it &s;hould be
done: This Coy Mi&s;tre&s;s, call'd Credit,
could never be woo'd; the more he pur|&s;ued
her, or the farther he follow'd her,
the fa&s;ter &s;he fled from him; and he
had the continual Mortification to &s;ee
his National Credit fall, even by the
&s;ame Methods which made our Nation|al
Credit ri&s;e; and as our Credit here
grew daily, and at la&s;t encrea&s;ed to &s;uch
a hight, that from paying Twelve and
Fourteen <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Money, and &s;trug|gling
with infinite Difficulties to get it
brought in, we came to reducing the In|ter&s;t
from Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> to Five <HI>per Cent.</HI>
and now to have the publick Command
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of what Money they pleas'd at Four <HI>per
Cent.</HI> and have it brought in fa&s;ter than
they could take it, or had any occa&s;ion
for it.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;et down here,
the Schemes, Projects, and infinite
Arts and &s;ecret Practi&s;es which the King
of <HI>France</HI> u&s;ed to command Credit; all
which were di&s;appointed and blown up,
by the frequent Exigences of the Pub|lick
Affairs, forcing him to violate the
Faith and Honour of his Edicts, Decla|ring
&s;uch or &s;uch a Fund of Intere&s;t to
be Sacred and Unalterable, and not to
be &s;top'd upon any account whatever;
and the next Year, or perhaps &s;ooner,
breaking thro' all tho&s;e Sacred Edicts,
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Payment, and leaving
the Lenders to Starve: Whereas in
<HI>England</HI> one Parliament always Voted
the making good the Deficiencies of
another; and no mi&s;application of
Money could be made, but every Fund
was kept Sacred to its particular &s;pecial
Appropriation; So that no Man what|ever
having lent his Money to the Go|vernment
on the Credit of a Parliamen|tary
Fund, has been De&s;rauded of his
Property.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
Thus the Arbitrary Government of
the King of <HI>France,</HI> the Property of
every Man being intirely at his Di&s;po&s;e,
de&s;troy'd the very Rea&s;on and Nature
of Publick Credit; and the Limited
Power of <HI>Great-Britains</HI> Crown, the
Strings of the Pur&s;e being in the hands
of the Parliament, who&s;e Appropria|tions,
if I may be allow'd to &s;peak &s;o
plain, even our Kings them&s;elves dur&s;t
not break in upon, has been the Rea|&s;on
and Foundation of &s;uch an im|men&s;e,
boundle&s;s Credit, that nothing
can hurt or de&s;troy, unle&s;s the Parlia|ment
&s;hould Invert their way of act|ing,
and take into their hands the &s;ame
Ab&s;olute Power which it is their bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to Re&s;train, and Wound and In|jure
them&s;elves, that is to &s;ay, the Peo|ple
whom they Repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But Fate and the Fortune of <HI>France</HI>
has now turn'd the Tables upon us, and
we &s;ee the &s;ame Arbitrary Power that
in the late Reign in <HI>France</HI> plung'd them
into an in&s;uperable Debt, and into an ir|recoverable
&s;tate of Deficiency and Di&s;count,
I &s;ay, the &s;ame Arbitrary Power
has rais'd an inconceivable Species of
meer Air and Shadow, realizing Fan|cies
and Imaginations, Vi&s;ions and Ap|paritions,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and making the meer &s;pecu|lations
of Things, act all the Parts,
and perform all the Offices of the
Things them&s;elves; and thus in a mo|ment
their Debts are all vani&s;h'd, the
Sub&s;tance is an&s;wer'd by the Shadow;
and the People of <HI>France</HI> are made the
In&s;truments of putting the Cheat upon
them&s;elves, the Name of the thing
is made an Equivalent to the Thing it
&s;elf, tran&s;po&s;ing the Debts from the
King to them&s;elves, and being contented
to Di&s;charge the Publick, owe the
Money to one another.</P>
<P>As this is the meer Con&s;equence of
a boundle&s;s Power in the King by
which he is made able to put every
Scheme, however impracticable in
other places, in a Cour&s;e of Opperation
there; &s;o that very Limitation of
Power, which is in other Ca&s;es our
Glory and Advantage, is the Rea&s;on
why, let our Credit be what it will,
our Debts remain, and mu&s;t be wa&s;ted
or dimini&s;hed off, by the &s;low fire of
Parliamentary Proceedings, and by no
other way.</P>
<P>And thus for once in the World,
Tyranny has the whip hand of Liberty;
for nothing can be done in <HI>England</HI> like
<PB N="7" REF="8">
this, even the Parliament it &s;elf is li|mited,
and there are its redeemable and
unredeemable Funds the la&s;t of which
are a Burthen, nothing but the Num|ber
<HI>Ninety Nine</HI> (Years) can put an
end to: But in <HI>France</HI> they have an un|bounded
liberty to act as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Let no Man mi&s;take me here, as if
I were bewailing the Incumbrances of
National Privileges, and &s;ugge&s;ting
that it was Pity we &s;hould be a Nation
of Liberty with &s;uch a Burthen of
Debt; on the other hand, let us be,
&s;ay I, a free Nation deep in Debt, ra|ther
than a Nation of Slaves Owing
nothing; and indeed even in this the
Condition of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> &s;tands
in a po&s;ture much to our Advantage
when compared together, namely
<HI>France,</HI> a Kingdom immen&s;ely Rich as
a Government, wretchedly Poor as a
People; <HI>England,</HI> a Government Em|barra&s;s'd
in Debt, Exhau&s;ted of Funds,
and not able (ea&s;ily) to get out of
Debt; But as a People immen&s;ely Rich,
Rich in the particular and private
Wealths of the Subjects; Poor, that
is to &s;ay, Encumbred in Debt, &s;peak|ing
of the publick &s;tate of Things as a
Government, and yet with all this,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
while the publick Credit remains, we can
never be &s;aid to be Poor: But of that
in another Place, and on another Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It remains now, that we look into
this &s;lagrant Delu&s;ion of paying a Na|tions
Debts, as it is Practi&s;ing upon the
Ignorant People in <HI>France:</HI> Never in
my Opinion, was any Number of Peo|ple
&s;o hook'd in to put a &s;ham upon
them&s;elves, and then call it paying off
the King's Debts, or the publick Debts;
for, as above, 'tis no more and no le&s;s,
than a parcel of Fools Di&s;charging the
King of his Debts, and Owing it to
one another. And this is another Rea|&s;on
of this piece of Magic in <HI>France,</HI>
for the very Want of Credit in <HI>France,</HI>
has been the Rea&s;on of their obtaining
the Credit of paying their Debts.
This Paradox &s;hall be unriddled im|mediately
thus: Had not the Publick
Credit been bad, had not the State
Bills, that is to &s;ay, the publick Credit
run at Sixty to Sixty three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Di&s;|count,
the People would never have
brought them&s;elves to part with them
for the Bonds, or Shares in a New
Company; a Brat of State, which has
its Life in the King's Breath, and mu&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="10">
die whenever that Breath plea&s;es to
determine it, that live by the favour of
the King, and Con&s;equently always
lives at his Mercy; ju&s;t thus, turn the
Tables again, I &s;ay, ju&s;t thus &s;tands the
Ca&s;e in <HI>England</HI> Rever&s;t, the goodne&s;s
of the Publick Credit in <HI>England,</HI> is the
rea&s;on why we &s;hall never be out of
Debt; for where is the Man that ha|ing
lent his Money to the Publick on
the Credit of Parliamentary Security,
will upon a whim, Di&s;charge that Fund,
and take a precarious Company of
Private Men for the Money.</P>
<P>The Funds are our Security, and we
are &s;atisfyed fully in the &s;afety of tho&s;e
Funds, becau&s;e made Sacred by the
Authority of Parliament; this is our
advantage who are private Men, and
have our E&s;tates there; but this is a
blow to the very po&s;&s;ibility of paying
the publick Debts, becau&s;e no Man is
out of Love with his Security, and be|cau&s;e
no better Security can be propo&s;ed by
any Man.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Premi&s;es, I come down to
the very Extraordinary Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> a
Man, who being fir&s;t acquainted with the &s;olid Immovable &s;tate of Credit in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;eeing the fluctuating

manner of things in France, plainly &s;aw
al&s;o, how ea&s;ie it was to pu&s;h tho&s;e
things there, which he could not &s;o
much as think of in <HI>England,</HI> without
apprehen&s;ions of being pull'd in pieces
by the Rabble.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did, who
wi&s;ely concluded, that a foundation of
Credit mu&s;t be laid before any &s;ufficient
Project could be founded upon it, I &s;ay,
the fir&s;t thing Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did, was to
Contemplate the Rai&s;ing a Royal Bank
in <HI>France,</HI> this he Effected by the Con|currence
of the King, who&s;e Sanction
there, as the Parliament would be here,
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a
Work.</P>
<P>Now let the Schemes Engrafted &s;ince,
or then de&s;ign'd to be Engrafted upon
the foot of this beginning be what they
will, whether Knavi&s;h or Sincere,
as I will not take upon me here to De|termine;
yet I &s;ay, let it be one way
or other, 'tis Evident Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> made a
Right Judgment, and that nothing
could be projected for the publick Service
of any kind, without an E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Credit to Center &s;ome where.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid already, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
this should be gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ted upon the
<PB N="11" REF="16">
Government, the Endeavours to bring
it to pa&s;s before, having been rendred a|bortive
by the frequent Exigencies of that
Government, forcing them to break in
upon them&s;elves, mortgage Faith and
Honour, Royal Edicts, and Royal Pro|mi&s;es,
the &s;tronge&s;t Engagements that
could at that time be made; by which
means the few Men that had any Money,
were made Cautious, and were grown
too Wi&s;e to put it into hands which they
could not depend upon for the Demand
of it again, when it &s;hould be wanted.</P>
<P>It remain'd then to re&s;olve, that
Credit could now, be only rai&s;ed upon
the forming Societies of Private Men,
who were Ma&s;ters of Ca&s;h, and able
to Support the Credit they took, with
whom it might be &s;afe to venture the
Depo&s;ite of Money, and who by an
Exact Currency of payments, might in
Con&s;equence, and by Degrees, obtain
the name or Title of a &s;afe Fund, and
become the Center of proper Credit for
the whole Kingdom; a thing at that
time greatly wanted, for the advantage
of Trade in <HI>France,</HI> as well as for the
Purpo&s;e de&s;ign'd by Mr. <HI>Laws.</HI> This al|mo&s;t
by the nature of the thing, would
be called a Bank, and would be managed
<PB N="12" REF="17">
by the fir&s;t Adventuters in their own
right, and independent of the King or
of any Branch of the Government; &s;o
that except by meer Plunder, even all
one as by Rifling the City of <HI>Paris,</HI>
the King could never lay his hand upon
any thing which was put into their
keeping.</P>
<P>This was a well lay'd de&s;ign, had
there been no more <HI>intended</HI> than was
<HI>pretended.</HI> For upon the Credit and
Capital Stock of the fir&s;t Sub&s;cribers,
there was immediately a Clear pro&s;pect
of a Currant Running Ca&s;h, E&s;tabli&s;h'd
upon ju&s;t Foundations, and Sufficient
to an&s;wer all the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>France;</HI> I
mean &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as was fit for the
managment of a Bank.</P>
<P>When this Scheme was &s;hew'd to the
Regent, he was too penetrating not to
&s;ee immediately, that it was too Beneficial
a thing not to be Encouraged, as well
for the Credit of the Nation in General,
as for the u&s;e of the Government in
Particular; and therefore received it
with open Arms, and a&s;&s;ured Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
of his Favour and Protection: But this
was not all, for every day giving new
lights into the thing it &s;elf, and new
pro&s;pects arri&s;ing every day, the Regent
<PB N="13" REF="18">
who begun even then to &s;ee that there
was nothing which might not be hoped
for from &s;uch a De&s;ign, as well for the
Service of the Government as the Ad|vantage
of Commerce in General, and
of Private Per&s;ons intere&s;ted in it in Par|ticular;
for really a Face of publick
Credit was a new thing in <HI>France,</HI> and
had &s;o long been De&s;ir'd, and &s;o often
Endeavoured without Succe&s;s, that it
look'd like a Dream, and that Man that
pretended to undertake it, was like an
Angel come from Heaven to bring them
good Tidings. From this time forward
Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> as he well de&s;erv'd, was re|ceived
with great Di&s;tinction, and ad|mitted
to &s;uch Privacies as became ne|ce&s;&s;ary
by the Importance of his Un|dertaking;
and as they found his fir&s;t
Scheme Fruitful of great Improvement,
he was Encouraged to apply his
thoughts Effectually to tho&s;e Improve|ments,
that &s;omething might be brought
to pa&s;s for the publick good, and E&s;pe|cially
to re&s;tore Credit to <HI>France,</HI> a thing
the whole Kingdom, but e&s;pecially as a
Government, had &s;uffered many Year
for the want of.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecution of this Confidence,
the Bank was E&s;tabli&s;hed, the Patents
<PB N="14" REF="19">
or Charter, as we would call it here, were
Expedited for its Foundation; the King
begins the Sub&s;cription, the Duke
Regent follows, and innumerable others;
they are Impower'd to take in a Hun|dred
Millions Original Stock, and to
give out Bills for Currant Ca&s;h payable
at Demand, and to the Bearer, ju&s;t after
the manner in <HI>England;</HI> and from that
time to this they have acted ju&s;t as ours
do here, are managed by a Court of
Directors, for the Governing daily, every
incident that may happen, and having
pre&s;erv'd their Credit in payments In|violably,
it is not ea&s;ie to concieve what
Stocks of Money they have brought
into their Hands, and to what mon&s;truous degree of Credit they are al|ready
arrived.</P>
<P>Their bu&s;ine&s;s is ju&s;t as it is with our
Bank here; they receive and Pay va&s;t
Sums of Money for the King and their
Bills pa&s;s in the Royal Trea&s;ury at
Ready Money; they have built a New
Bureau or Office, and it was a prodigy
not often &s;een in <HI>Paris,</HI> to &s;ee about
Three hundred Carriages Loaden with
Silver and Gold, carried under the Guard
of a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y of Dragoons, through the
Streets to the New Hou&s;e, where they
<PB N="15" REF="20">
made a large Vault, which they call
the <HI>Charter-hou&s;e,</HI> for the keeping it &s;afe
and pre&s;erving with it their Writings,
Pledges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They lend Money upon Jewels,
Plate, and things of real Value, not
Peri&s;hable by keeping; and upon Mort|gage
of Lands at three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t;
they Di&s;count Bills, and take in Money,
I&s;&s;uing Bills of Credit payable at De|mand;
and it is inconcievable the mighty
Encrea&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s they have upon
their hands in &s;o little time, and the
immen&s;e Sums of Money they have by
them in Specie.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> having thus &s;ucce&s;sfully
fini&s;hed this great Affair, was at Lea&s;ure
to enquire what further Projects might
be founded upon this of a Royal Bank
He was too knowing not to have in his
Head the General Idea of all tho&s;e
things which have happened &s;ince, tho'
not perhaps of the Succe&s;s they have
met with, which I cannot but believe
have Exceeded his own Expectation:
But he that knew that nothing could
be done without a Fund of Credit fir&s;t
E&s;tabli&s;hed, knew al&s;o that &s;uch a Fund
of Credit being once throughly E&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
nothing could mi&s;carry that was
<PB N="16" REF="21">
founded upon it; for as half the Projects
In the World fail, and become abortive
for want of ready Money and Credit,
&s;o when once a Project is backed and
&s;upported with a flu&s;h of Ready Money,
they mu&s;t be weak Mannagers indeed,
if they mi&s;carry; for being well backed,
the Execution is in a manner &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing of Moment he went
upon, was the planting a Collony in
the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or in <HI>North-America;</HI> not
that Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> did not know that the
Planting the <HI>Loui&s;iania;</HI> or the Country
on the River <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> would not pro|duce
any great Effects, at lea&s;t in his
time; for the Settling a Collony, how|ever
pro&s;perous in its begining is a Work
of time, and mu&s;t take up not many
Years only, but ages of Years; and
that the utmo&s;t he could have before
him in &s;uch an Undertaking, was to die
in the Faith of its &s;ucce&s;s, and to have
the Satisfaction of having his Name
very much talked of when he was
Dead.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> like a Man of ju&s;t Reach
and Penetration, knew that two things
would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his
De&s;ign, I. To have the King approve
and Embark in his de&s;igns, and, 2. To
<PB N="17" REF="22">
make his Scheme Popular, to have
&s;omething in View that &s;hould look
Capital; have a view and pro&s;pect of
Succe&s;s, beyond, not only what he
could manage, but even beyond what
he ever intended in the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Having &s;tarted the Project of Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi,
he branch'd it out in a Different
manner from all Projects; for he did
not de&s;cend from the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> Scheme
as the General, to the &s;ub&s;equent things
as the Particulars; but he a&s;cended from
the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> Scheme as a Particular, to
a <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company as the General;
and a General it was, fruitful of many
Particulars, every one in them&s;elves,
capable of as great things, and perhaps
greater than the Planting the Colonies
of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> was in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>When the Company was thus for|med,
his next work was to propo&s;e the
Foundation on which they were to be
E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and this was a Sub&s;cription
of Stock; and here he &s;hewed his fir&s;t
Ma&s;terly Stroke, and that he had Con|certed
all the &s;teps and mea&s;ures of his
Management from the beginning: The
Publick Credit in <HI>France</HI> was &s;till low,
nor did the Ri&s;ing Credit of the Royal
Bank add any thing to it, but rather
<PB N="18" REF="23">
dimini&s;h'd, it and let the World &s;ee that
private Credit in <HI>France</HI> might revive,
but publick Credit could not: The
State Bills, and Credits, Annuities on
the Town-hou&s;e, Loans, and all the
publick Papers which the Government
had Drawn the People in to part with
their Money to purcha&s;e, were at this
time exceeding low, namely from 57,
to 63 <HI>per Cent.</HI> lo&s;s, and like to be more;
it was the ea&s;Sie&s;t thing in the World
to E&s;tabli&s;h a Fund for any New Under|taking
that was but tollerablypromi&s;ing,
where the Sub&s;cribers could be allow'd
to &s;ub&s;cribe the&s;e Dying Credits at a
PAR, and put that into Stock at 100
Livres, which Co&s;t the Purcha&s;er but
37 to 40 Livres <HI>per Cent.</HI> And this thing
alone fill'd his Sub&s;cription, which at
fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of 100 Millions, and was
very quickly full.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Bite Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> may be &s;aid
to put upon the Country was, to give
out by way of <HI>premio,</HI> Ten Thou&s;and
Piftoles, or thereabouts, at the Rate of
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>per Cent.</HI> for the Refu&s;ing of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi,</HI>
or <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Stock, now &s;ub&s;crib'd
and full, at 100 Livres each Action for a
Years time: This was what we call, <HI>The
baying of the Bear-skin;</HI> and was a dear
<PB N="19" REF="24">
Bear skin to tho&s;e that &s;old it, as we
&s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>This was the time they begun to
banter Mr. <HI>Laws:</HI> Some &s;aid he was
Mad, and knew not what to do with
his Money; others Laugh'd at him,
and &s;aid, He was not in <HI>England,</HI> where
he could hedge one way to day, and
another way to morrow; could give in
the morning and take in the afternoon;
And thus they took the Money greedi|ly,
not Con&s;idering what might be hid
under the management of a Man who&s;e
Talent they had not yet tryed.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ely pa&s;s over here the many
Movements which Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> made in
this part, to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the Ad|vance
he &s;hould get by the Ri&s;e of his
Stock; for he who had the Power of
adding Credit to his Project whenever
he pleas'd, had nothing to do but to
make &s;ure of the Profits of the fir&s;t
Ri&s;e to him&s;elf; and therefore he took
Care to give out his whole Sum, as I
have heard, of 10000 Pi&s;toles, before
he &s;et his other Wheels at work. And
after this let us &s;ee how he went on:</P>
<P>He had now a Bank of Currant Ca&s;h
E&s;tabli&s;h'd on one hand; this he has
kept free and unconcern'd in all Adven|tures
<PB N="20" REF="25">
or Projects, as what might one way
or other &s;hake their Credit; but he kept
them perfectly unincumbred, always
able to an&s;wer all Demands upon them,
and to re&s;i&s;t every &s;hock that might be
made upon them, by the force of their
ready Money in &s;pecie; none of which
he would &s;uffer to be Dimini&s;hed, ex|cept
by Loans on &s;ufficient Securities.
And I &s;hall give pre&s;ently an Account
how this method was their real Securi|ty,
and how they had been overthrown
at once, by the Chicannry of their and
his Enemies if this Cour&s;e had not been
taken; of which by and by.</P>
<P>He had on the other hand a Sub|&s;cription
of Adventurers, as they might
truly be call'd; and as the nature of the
thing indeed Imported, who&s;e Stock
did not co&s;t them much, being bought
as above; with what Co&s;t them not a|bove,
37 to 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and even was
not indeed very Currant at that Price
neither: The&s;e therefore were fit to run
any rea&s;onable ri&s;que, to embark in any
probable Undertaking; to advance the
Credit of that Undertaking; and, if
po&s;&s;ible, to rai&s;e their Imaginary Stock,
for it was no more at fir&s;t, to a Real
Stock of 100 Livres in Value, for 100
<PB N="21" REF="26">
Livres Sub&s;cription; and the way how
to do this, therefore was the next pro|per
bu&s;ine&s;s of the Company to Con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be Enquir'd was,
to find out &s;omething to do, &s;omething
to Trade in, for as to Planting in
<HI>Me&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> tho' that was to be kept going
on, as the Denominating Bu&s;ine&s;s of
the whole; yet it was plain, that Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> never De&s;ign'd a Hundred Millions
of Livres &s;hould be Employ'd in People|ing
a Wilderne&s;s: He therefore turns
back to the King, from whom he Re|ceived
the Life of the whole, and by
who&s;e Authority and Bu&s;ine&s;s all the
Wheels were to be &s;et to Work.</P>
<P>The Publick was a large Field, were
one Man has no Credit, and another
great Credit; 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee who of
the two &s;hould be the gainer by the
other: He that has no Credit can do no|thing
without Money, he that has
Credit wants no Money tho' he has
none.</P>
<P>A Government &s;unk into Debt, and
her Securities bought at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Di&s;count, gives Room for va&s;t Advan|tages,
where the Party has Money to
work with; in a Word the Bu&s;ine&s;s
was to buy Low, and then bring up
<PB N="22" REF="27">
the Price of what was bought; namely
to buy at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> co&s;t, and then
fell at a PAR, as we now &s;ee is &s;ince
done.</P>
<P>The King, I &s;ay, was their fir&s;t Mer|chant
they had to deal with, and the&s;e
were the Goods he had to &s;ell (<HI>viz.</HI>)
State Bills of Several Kinds, Annuities,
Intere&s;ts on Loans, Rents of the Town-Hou&s;e,
and the like; and here I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that the performing this Wonder
I'am now to &s;peak of, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of Re&s;toring
the publick Credit, &s;o as to bring a Sum
&s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly great as Fifteen Hundred
Millions, and &s;unk &s;o very low as from
60 to 65 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Di&s;count, to be Sale|able
at a PAR; nay to 10, 20, and 30
<HI>per Cent.</HI> advance, for that they would
have been at, but Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> him&s;elf
Checkt it; I &s;ay the Entertaining a
thought that &s;uch a Scheme was practi|cable,
and laying a Scheme to do it, was
as great a Te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
Genius and Capacity, as the Performance
has been of his good Fortune.</P>
<P>It was a Sea, &s;o full of dangerous Shoals,
and Rocks, &s;o &s;ubject to &s;udden Storms
and Hurricanes, in a Word, &s;o threat|ning
of certain Shipwreck; that no
Pilot but this alone, would ever have
<PB N="23" REF="28">
ventured to have Launched out in
it.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t cea&s;e the Wondering,
and go back beyond Wonder it &s;elf,
Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> had begun well, the Bank
was E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and began to gain upon
the World; the Credit of it, as I have
already ob&s;erv'd, appear'd openly, and
&s;eem'd to be Invulnerable; it was foun|ded
upon a Sub&s;tantial ba&s;is, nay, indeed
the only ba&s;is that could &s;upport Publick
Credit, (<HI>viz.</HI>) it always had the Money
in Specie and in its own keeping, &s;uffici|ent
to an&s;wer all Demands; upon this
almo&s;t any thing might be under|taken.</P>
<P>But
here I mu&s;t not only give another
in&s;tance of the ma&s;terly Genius of
Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> the Contriver of all the&s;e
things, but mu&s;t let the World &s;ee, that
as no De&s;ign however good in it &s;elf,
and adapted for the general good of
our Country, can be without Enemies,
Envy con&s;tantly oppo&s;ing it&s;elf to the
be&s;t De&s;igns; &s;o it was here; this Bank
had a Formidable attack made upon it
by a &s;et of Merchants in <HI>Paris;</HI> &s;ome
&s;aid they were <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> o|thers
that they were <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants
Dwelling in <HI>Paris,</HI> and others, that
<PB N="24" REF="29">
they were <HI>French;</HI> be that as it will,
po&s;&s;ibly they might be &s;ome of all the
three &s;orts, for it could not be done by
a few: The Sum they appeared with,
being no le&s;s than Twenty five Millions.
The Plot in a few Words was to mu&s;ter
up a large Number of Bills, to be
Demanded altogether, and if po&s;&s;ible
to give a Blow to the Credit; in a Word,
and to Expre&s;s it in our Terms, to make
a Run upon the Bank. The Particulars
of the Story are related thus.</P>
<Q><P>It was a little after the fir&s;t advance
of the Credit of the Royal Bank at
<HI>Paris,</HI> of which Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> was the
principal Director, as he really was
the Father and Author of it; &s;ome
Merchants in <HI>Paris</HI> (it was reported
to be a Plot Originally laid at <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>
or more properly in <HI>Holland</HI>)
whether it was &s;o or not we do not
affirm, but this is certain, that they
were chiefly <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants who
appeared in it at <HI>Paris;</HI> we &s;ay, &s;ome
Merchants at <HI>Paris</HI> having &s;ome time
before Concerted their Mea&s;ures to
give a blow to the Bank, Trea&s;ured
up a number of Bank Bills, to the
Sum of Twenty five Millions as &s;ome
<PB N="25" REF="30">
&s;ay, others Twenty two Millions of
Livres, and appear altogether, tho' in
&s;everal forms, as of &s;eparate Per&s;ons
and Intere&s;t, at the Bank, ju&s;t at the
&s;ame Hour, to Demand the Money
for tho&s;e Bills.</P>
<P>The Clarks at the Bank Surpriz'd
with the appearance of &s;o many
Eminent Merchants, and with &s;uch
great Demands, an&s;wer'd, that they
&s;hould be paid, but de&s;ir'd them to
wait a little till they could &s;end to
Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> the Director, that they
might have his orders how to pro|ceed
in paying them; accordingly
they immediately acquainted Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> with the thing, he paus'd a
while at the thing, and without any
Supprize, after a little Con&s;ideration,
bid them go back and tell the Mer|chants
they &s;hould all be paid, and
bid the Clarks begin the payment,
and to pay them all in <HI>Lowes d'or's</HI> or
<HI>Pi&s;toles,</HI> and that he would come Im|mediately
to the Office, which he
did, having fir&s;t been to tell the
Regent his Scheme, and had the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Royal Trea&s;ury, and
of the General Farmers, for about
One hundred fifty thou&s;and Pi&s;toles
<PB N="26" REF="31">
in Specie, if he had wanted them,
which however he did not.</P>
<P> Accordingly the Clarks begun the
payment, and it held till the next
day afternoon; by which time, as
we have the Story, an Edict was
procured and actually made Publick
to reduce the Lowis d'or's from 16 to
15 Livres, which lo&s;s fell in&s;tantly
upon the Merchants, while they had
above a Million and a quarter of
Pi&s;toles in their Hands in Specie, and
the Bank having &s;tood its Ground,
had mo&s;t of tho&s;e Pi&s;toles in their
C&s;h again in a few Days.</P></Q>
<P>This was a home Thru&s;t at the Bank,
but as it was Parry'd with &s;o much
Art, and the Lo&s;s of it turn'd upon
the Contrivers, it E&s;tabli&s;h'd the very
Foundation which it was form'd to
&s;hake, and gave &s;uch a Credit, not only
to the Bank, but to Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> the prin|cipal
Manager and Director in that
Exigence, that it &s;ecured them both
from any future attempts of that na|ture;
it al&s;o let the World &s;ee, that
not only they were &s;trong in the &s;ub|&s;tance
of their Ca&s;h, and able to an|&s;wer
all Demands, and not only that
<PB N="27" REF="32">
they had a &s;uperior Genius at the head
of their management, which was al|ways
able to Counter-act their Projects,
but that they had the Government hard
and fa&s;t to &s;upport them upon all Oc|ca&s;ions;
and this indeed was &s;uch a
Foundation, that when the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> or
<HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company was fir&s;t formed, it
was apparent, that tho' there was little
or nothing in the thing it&s;elf, yet there
were other Engraftments to be made
upon it by the Government, that it could
not mi&s;s of Succe&s;s; and that in a Word,
that <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> was only the Name, but
that the Thing was intended to be a
Fund of Credit, upon which the &s;ink|ing
Fortunes of the Government were
to ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we found gave life to
the Company was the Coinage, the
next was the Farm of Tobacco, either
of the&s;e were Things of a magnitude
&s;ufficient to have given Credit to any
new Fund; but &s;eem'd to be but Tri|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es
in the hand of the Company, who
apparently aim'd at the General Ma|nagement
of the Revenues of <HI>France:</HI>
However, as the undertaking of the
Coinage was a va&s;t thing in its Nature,
&s;o the manner of the Contract, the Pru|dence
<PB N="28" REF="33">
with which the Company engag'd
in it, the vi&s;ible Advantage which the
Company would make by it, and above
all the Advance which they were to
make to the King for it, were &s;uch
Great things that it &s;tartled the World,
and they began to talk of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI>
Company, as of an Opulent Powerful
Body, that being Headed by an Enter|pri&s;ing
Man, who apparently had un|dertaken
what never Man before him
undertook, and perfectly under&s;tood
what he had undertaken, had more in
it than was at fir&s;t imagin'd, and
would arrive to &s;ome greater hight than
had been thought po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Thoughts, and the Re|putation
of the Company's underta|king
beginning to be Popular, every
body enquired into it, and the farther
they look'd into it, the better they be|gan
to like it; and this &s;et People fir&s;t
upon buying the Stock, and the Num|ber
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">yers, by the meer nature
of the thing, would ri&s;e the Value.</P>
<P>Now it appear'd every day more
and more, that Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> had lay'd his
Mea&s;ures right when he gave away his
Pi&s;toles, as I have &s;aid above, to have
the refu&s;al of the Stock at 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="34">
for on a &s;udden the Stock jumpt up to
PAR, and in three or four days more to
150. Had Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> &s;tay'd the full time,
and not Demanded the Stock till it was
Advanc'd as we now &s;ee it ri&s;en, he
mu&s;t in all probability have lo&s;t the
Advantage he had due to him, &s;eeing
very few of the Per&s;ons he had Con|tracted
with would have been able to
make good a difference of a Stock ri&s;en
from under a Hundred to a Thou&s;and:
But as he &s;hew'd his Moderation in De|manding
the Stock, within the advance
of about 200 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Per&s;ons who
lo&s;t that Money to him, were &s;oon
made amends if they had any Stock,
by finding it &s;till ri&s;ing upon their
hands to a prodigious degree in a few
days.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t take the liberty to make a
Digre&s;&s;ion here, to the Volatile Tem|per
of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who&s;e levity
only can account for what we are now
to take notice of, and the warmth of
the <HI>French</HI> Temper mu&s;t indeed be an|&s;werable
for the running up an Imagi|nary
Stock; for except about 37 or 40
Livres, upon a 100 in the fir&s;t Sub|&s;cription,
it was no other to &s;uch a &s;ud|den
and &s;uch an unaccountable extra|vagant
hight.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="35">
This warmth of the <HI>French</HI> Temper,
which prompts them to pu&s;h things up
to the Extremity, was certainly the Rea|&s;on,
I mean the Original Rea&s;on of the
&s;udden Advance of the&s;e things, for as
yet there was no weight in the things
them&s;elves, that could bear any pro|portion
to the New Credit they a&s;|&s;um'd;
The Company had indeed en|gag'd
with the Government, and had
taken the Coinage of the King, as
above, and in Nine years it was calcu|lated
they would get near Fifty Milli|ons
by their Contract, provided al&s;o
the Government kept their Word with
them, and made no new alterations in
the Coin to their Detriment: But even
this, in an Arbitrary Admini&s;tration,
&s;uch as that of <HI>France</HI> is known to be,
was not &s;o certain, but that the Ri&s;que
of it was worth &s;omething to En&s;ure;
and all the Doubt that could be ju&s;tly
rais'd on that Head, pleaded in abate|ment
to the Credit of the Company.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore, I &s;ay, be placed
to the account of the &s;luttering, ra&s;h
Di&s;po&s;ition of the People of <HI>France,</HI>
that a thing who had yet no farther or
greater pro&s;pect than that of the Coin|age,
&s;hould in a few days mount up its
<PB N="31" REF="36">
Credit to near 200 <HI>per Cent,</HI> upon the
Value.</P>
<P>But as we are immediately to &s;ee
things more prodigious than this, let us
Di&s;charge our &s;elves of this Particular
fir&s;t, that we may clear things as they
go; The Arret for Granting to the
Company the Coinage, as above, will
fully de&s;cribe the Circum&s;tances of
their Contract, and the View of Ad|vantages
they had by it; and there|fore
I cannot go on, till I have given it
at large, as follows:</P>

<P>THE King having by his Let|ters
Patents of the Month of
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1717, e&s;tabli&s;hed a Trading
Company under the Name of the

that that Company takes
the be&s;t Mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the

they &s;end a great Number of Inhabi|tants
<PB N="32" REF="37">

which was granted them; that many
private Per&s;ons make Settlements in
that Colony, and &s;end thither Hu&s;|bandmen.
Tillers, and other Handi|craft-men,
to manure and improve
the Land, &s;ow Corn, plant Tobacco,
breed Silk-worms, and do whatever
is nece&s;&s;ary to improve that Country.
Furthermore, his Maje&s;ty being in|formed
that the <HI>India</HI> Company is
at great Charges for tran&s;porting the
&s;aid Inhabitants, and furni&s;hing the
Colony with Meal and other Nece&s;&s;a|ries
till the Land afford a &s;ufficient
Quantity of Provi&s;ion for their Sub|&s;i&s;tance:
That the &s;aid Company
&s;ends thither all &s;orts of Goods and
Merchandize to render the Life of
the Inhabitants more comfortable,
and that for preventing Abu&s;es too
frequent in Colonies, they have taken
Care to &s;ettle the Price thereof at a
moderate Rate by a general Tariff,
which they have &s;ent thither to be
affixed in their Store-hou&s;es and Ma|gazines;
that they have ordered the

Commerce to its full Extent, and that
it is nece&s;&s;ary in the begining of
E&s;tabli&s;hments of this Nature, to
give them all po&s;&s;ible Protection and

State.</HEAD>
<P>THE King having ordered in
Council his Edict in <HI>May,</HI>
1718. whereby new Species of Gold
and Silver are ordered to be made,
to be laid before him, and his Ma|je&s;ty
being informed, that be&s;ides the
good effects the Coyning thereof has
produc'd, other con&s;iderable Advan|tages
may be expected from the par|ticular
Attention to be given to its
Continuation. Among the &s;everal
Propo&s;als that have been made to
him on this Matter, none has appear|ed
more Advantagious than the Pro|po&s;ition
of the Directors of the <HI>India</HI>
Company, who offer to pay to his
Maje&s;ty Fifty Millions of Livres in
Specie, in Fifteen equal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
Payments from Month to Month,
<PB N="45" REF="42">
the fir&s;t beginning on the fir&s;t of
<HI>October</HI> next and the la&s;t the fir&s;t of
<HI>December,</HI> 1720. upon Condition that
the &s;aid Company &s;hall enjoy for
Nine years together, to begin from
the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> next the Benefit
and Advantage ari&s;ing from the old
Species and Bullion that &s;hall be
brought to the King's Mints to be
coyn'd into new Species. His Maje&s;ty
is &s;o much the more inclined to ac|cept
the Propo&s;als of the &s;aid Com|pany,
becau&s;e they may better and
more and conveniently than private
Men import Species and Bullion
out of Foreign Countries, and that
con&s;equently they may get a greater
Advantage thereby than his Maje&s;ty
could get if the Coinage of the new
Species was continued upon his own
Account; and furthermore con&s;ider|ing
that the Profit that will ari&s;e out
of the &s;ame will be divided between
great numbers of his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects,
concerned in the &s;aid Compa|ny,
and that a Supply &s;o certain and
ready will enable his Maje&s;ty to pay
the Arrears of Pen&s;ions and other
Expences, His Maje&s;ty, with the
Advice of Mon&s;ieur the Duke of <HI>Or|leans,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="43">
Regent, has ordained, and or|dains
as follows:</P>
<P>This Arre&s;t contains four Articles,
which are to this effect: 1. His Ma|je&s;ty
accepts the offer made by the
<HI>India</HI> Company of the Sum of Fifty
Millions of Livres, to be paid in
Fifteen &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Months, to begin
from the fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> next, at the
rate of 3, 333, 333 Livres, 6 Pence,
8 Deniers <HI>per</HI> Month, and orders that
the &s;ame be brought to his Royal
Trea&s;ury, and that the Receipt given
by the Keeper thereof be a &s;ufficient
Di&s;charge to the &s;aid Company, with|out
being accountable to the Cham|ber
of Accounts. 2. Be&s;ides the &s;aid
Sum of Fifty Millions, the Company
is to be at all the charges of the
Coinage, Remittance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as
the King does actually pay. 3. Up.
on the&s;e Conditions, the King grants
to the &s;aid Company all the Profits
and Advantages that &s;hall accrue
from the Coining into new Species of
Gold and Silver in his Mints, the old
Species of <HI>France,</HI> the Species of Fo|reign
Countries, and Bullion that
&s;hall be imported, what Sum &s;oever
they may amount to, on the foot
<PB N="47" REF="44">
and manner regulated by the Edict of
<HI>May,</HI> 1718, for Nine Years together,
to begin from the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> next.
4. His Maje&s;ty declares, that during
the &s;aid Nine Years, he will not make
any Augmentation in the Price of the
Species, nor le&s;&s;en the Standard of
his Coin upon any Pretence what&s;o|ever,
and that in ca&s;e of any Diminu|tion,
he will lower the Bullion and
old Species proportionably. Done in
the Council of State, <HI>July</HI> 25. 1719.</P>

<P>It was &s;ome Weeks that the Credit
of the Company fed upon this Under|taking,
and Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> who prudently
gave every thing time to Work, let it
run on &s;ome time, upon this view only.
till the People began to talk a little du|bious
about it; That it was true, the
Company would get Money by the
Coinage, but it mu&s;t be in a length of
time; and that this was not &s;o con&s;ider|able,
that the Stock &s;hould mount up
to &s;uch a hight upon that Advantage
only.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things began to be the
&s;ubject of Di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> began to
think of playing another Mine; for I am
to &s;uppo&s;e all along this Gentleman to
<PB N="48" REF="45">
have built his whole fabrick in his Ima|gination
at once, and to have Dige&s;ted
every part even from the beginning in
his Thoughts, but re&s;olved to bring
every thing about by ju&s;t degrees, and
to give every thing that he &s;tarted into
the World its full &s;cope, to extend it
&s;elf to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden then, for all his Mo|tions
were like Mines, &s;prung from
beneath, not the lea&s;t Notice being
given of any thing till it bur&s;t out like
a &s;udden Fire, I &s;ay, on a &s;udden he
Declares at his Levee, which now be|gan
to be as Great as that of a Publick
Mini&s;ter, That the King had United
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company to that of <HI>Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI>
or the <HI>We&s;t-India,</HI> and immedi|ately
after, that is to &s;ay, the next
morning an Arret of the King's Coun|cil
appear'd, by which the two Com
panies were United, and the Stock of
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company Ingrafted into
the other Company, as by the Arret it
&s;elf is be&s;t explain'd, and which has in
it &s;everal Clau&s;es infinitely to the Ad|vantage
of the Company, in Trade as
well as in Credit, tho' even in this Con|junction,
and all the Advantages of a
Commerce to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> encrea&s;ed
<PB N="49" REF="46">
as they might be able to encrea&s;e it,
were in them&s;elves but remote things,
and could produce no great things for
&s;ome Years to come, and therefore
could not be an addition of an Intrin|&s;ick
worth, on which to rai&s;e &s;uch an
immen&s;e inexpre&s;&s;ible fund of Credit
as immediately appear'd: But let us
go on gradually, and fir&s;t look into the
Arret it &s;elf, that we may the better
judge of what it is the Company en|joy,
and what they ought to be valued
at upon that particular Account. The
Arret is as follows:</P>

the General Farms made in favour of
<HI>Aymart Lambert</HI> for fix Years, which
begun on the fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> 1718.

That in order to enable the &s;aid Com|pany

is de&s;ired to authorize and im|power
the &s;aid Company to borrow
Twelve hundred Millions of Livres,

Millions afore&s;aid, Commi&s;&s;ioners
appointed by his Maje&s;ty for that
purpo&s;e, &s;hall make and deliver to
the &s;aid Company, one or more Con|tracts

Twelve Hundred Millions of Livres
afore&s;aid, which Rents &s;hall be a&s;|&s;igned

the Annual Sum of Thirty Six Mil|lions
of Livres for the Payment

the Term of the Nine Years of

thereof the Farmers of the General
Farms, &s;hall be oblig'd, in ca&s;e the

<P>It is not to be expre&s;s'd with what
&s;urpri&s;e, and even a&s;toni&s;hment the
World look'd on at the&s;e &s;teps of Mr.
<HI>Laws,</HI> his Fame for an Enterprizing
Man was now E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and tho&s;e
who had before run pretty much upon
<PB N="54" REF="51">
his Crdit, and talk'd to his prejudice
among the common People, began to
&s;ay now he was <HI>&V;ne habile homme,</HI> and
that he was capable of great things;
for the noi&s;e of this new <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company &s;pread like a Clap of Thun|der
far and wide, and People began to
&s;ee a new world of Profit attending it,
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade being carried on in
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> and in <HI>Holland</HI> to &s;uch a
magnitude and to &s;o much advantage,
as we all know it to be done.</P>
<P>All this while the on looking World
regarded in their Calculations nothing
but the Profits of Trade, and the Ad|vantages
the Company might make by
great Returns, having a Capital Stock,
and a good Oeconomy in their Affairs,
keeping their eyes upon the Number of
Ships to be &s;ent annually to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
the Extent of their Colonies
and Plantations in the <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> and on
the Banks of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ppi,</HI> what Rents
in time &s;hall accrue to the Stock, and
what Annual Incoms the Company
would receive, whereby they would
be enabled to make Dividends propot|tion'd
to 250 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Sub|&s;criptions
as they were then advanc'd,
not imagining what was yet behind.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="52">
But Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> who&s;e Views lay
another way, regarded all the&s;e things,
only as they tended to rai&s;e Fund of
Credit at home, which was from the
beginning the Point he aim'd at, lea|ving
all other things to work their own
way; not but the remote&s;t Pro&s;pects
concurr'd to an&s;wer the &s;ame End,
and a Complication of Advantages
however remote, &s;erv'd to bring about
the great Point, <HI>viz.</HI> The making the
Credit of the whole to ri&s;e beyond ima|gination,
and &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all
the great Things he had &s;till in View.</P>
<P>The Stock was now ri&s;en to an ex|ce&s;&s;ive
hight, from 325 to 350 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> and now was the Time for Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> to let the world &s;ee what a Fund
of Credit is able to do, and to make
good the undoubted Maxim, That <HI>a
Fund of Credit, is a Fund of Money,</HI>
and able to make it &s;elf equal to all
the Money in the World; for now was
the time to &s;trike the blow, that <HI>Coup
d'Eclat,</HI> which &s;hould &s;urprize and a&s;to|ni&s;h
the World, and which will for
ever be &s;poken of as an Action, that
the World never heard of the like be|fore.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="53">
Nor did Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> bring it out all at
once, but &s;uffer'd it to be di&s;cours'd of
gradually, That the Company was
about to take upon them the manage|ment
of the King's Revenue; in a few
days after, for Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> never &s;uffer'd
the Town to be Ma&s;ter of his Mea|&s;ures
before they were ripe, but it had
not been long &s;poken of that the Com|pany
would take upon them the ma|nagement
of the Revenue, when at
once, ju&s;t as before, and Arre&s;t was pub|li&s;hed,
Di&s;&s;olving the Lea&s;es of the
General Farmers of the Revennue, tho'
their Lea&s;es had five Years to run, and
ve&s;ting the whole Collection in the new
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indsa</HI> Company.</P>
<P>As an Inducement to this, the Com|pany
undertake to encrea&s;e the pay|ment
to the King, no le&s;s than four
Millions a Year, a Sum too Con&s;idera|ble
not to be Vallued: But at the end
of this comes a Clau&s;e, which none
but &s;uch a Man as Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> could have
ventur'd upon, a thing Po&s;terity will
look back upon as a Romance, and
which no Hi&s;tory can give any thing
like it, namely, the paying the King's
Debts, that is to &s;ay, the Company to
take upon them at once the Di&s;charging
<PB N="57" REF="54">
all the King's Debts upon what&s;oever
Doubtful Funds, upon whatever pre|carious
Circum&s;tances they &s;tood, what|ever
Di&s;counts they were at, all are to
be transferr'd at once from the Royal
Trea&s;ury, where they would never
have been able to Di&s;charge them, to
the Trea&s;ury of the Company where
they are to be paid at Demand.</P>
<P>Two things make this Undertaking
a Prodigy of Management, the like
of which was never heard of before:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The King's Debts amounted to
about Fifteen Hundred Mil|lions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Company had not any
Fund of Money, or the Value of
Money to pay them with.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But before I go on, I mu&s;t go back
to the Arre&s;ts or Proclamations, Di|recting
the Execution of this unparal|lel'd
Contract, which by mi&s;take is al|ready
placed <HI>Page</HI> 49. but &s;hould have
come in here.</P>
<P>Here is &s;uch a blow &s;truck, as the
World never heard of before; and in
this very &s;troke we may behold the
Power of Credit, and what immen&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="55">
Structures <HI>may be built,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Laws
has built</HI> upon this &s;ingle foundation,
by which he has re&s;tor'd a Govern|ment
overwhelm'd with Debt and
which was turn'd Bankrupt to the Peo|ple,
and has deliver'd a Nation op|pre&s;s'd
with Taxes, in &s;uch a manner,
and in &s;o &s;hort a time, that Po&s;terity
will never believe the relation, but will
all look like a Fable or Romance in
their Eyes.</P>
<P>The Arret or Act of the King's Coun|cil
above mention'd, for the &s;ettling
this Point, tells us expre&s;ly what the
Company are to do, and expre&s;&s;es the
Sum which they are to lend the King
for the doing it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they
&s;hould lend the King Twelve Hundred
Millions of Livres at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and
afterwards they added three Millions
more, for the paying off all the pub|lick
Debts, and &s;trictly ties them down
to &s;o punctual a Di&s;charge of tho&s;e
Debts, and of all the Sallaries of the
Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it &s;hall be wholly in
the choice of the Per&s;ons who are to be
paid, whether they will accept of the
Company's Bonds, or have their Rea|dy
Money paid them. But the Arrets
do not at all meddle with the Method
<PB N="59" REF="56">
by which the Company &s;hall rai&s;e &s;uch
an Infinite ma&s;s of Money to pay, but
&s;uppo&s;es the Money &s;hall all be actually
ready in Ca&s;h, in Specie to pay, only
gives the Company Power to Borrow
&s;uch a Sum, that is to &s;ay, if any one
will lend it; for they do not oblige any
one to Lend, much le&s;s to accept the
Company's Security for the Debt; for
that would but have been exchanging
the Government for the Company, and
leaving the Debt &s;till in being.</P>
<P>Nor on the other hand was here the
lea&s;t Con&s;ideration to the Company
for &s;o great an Advantage to the Go|vernment,
as that of clearing them at
once of all the publick Debts; had the
Company re&s;erv'd but the &s;mall ad|vantage
of One <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Intere&s;t
as they were empowered to Borrow,
the 1200 Millions at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> had the
Government paid 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which
had been ju&s;t 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Gain, there
had been then &s;ome vi&s;ible Profit,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) there had been Twelve Milli|ons
<HI>per Annum</HI> in the Company's Poc|ket,
to have enabled them, or help'd
at lea&s;t, to make &s;ome proportion'd
Dividends to the mon&s;trous advance of
their Stock.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="57">
But the whole Scene may be one con|tinued
Prodigy, they &s;eek no Advan|tage,
they Demand no more than
Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> and propo&s;e to Borrow,
if they want it, at Three <HI>per Cent.</HI>
acting in every part of it upon the
foundation of Publick Service, with|out
Gain to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But neither is this all, for we &s;hall
pre&s;ently &s;ee them not only take no
Surplus of Intere&s;t, no Gain of Intere&s;t
more than they pay; But we &s;hall &s;ee
the Credit ri&s;ing to an immen&s;e hight,
and the Company growing Powerful by
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Government, and
the management of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> their
Director: I &s;ay, we &s;hall &s;ee the fol|lowing
My&s;teries, or, indeed, Mira|cles,
wrought in the compa&s;s of a few
Weeks, Things as incredible as the
greate&s;t Impo&s;&s;ibility in Nature could
be thought to be; things which now
they are done they are as a Dream
even to tho&s;e that &s;ee them; even the
People who have the Money in their
hands, and who has receiv'd their an|tient
Debts, fo long given over, &s;o ef|fectually
de&s;pair'd of, they look amaz'd,
and Con&s;ider again and again, whether
they are awake or a&s;leep, they handle
<PB N="61" REF="58">
it, weigh it, and roll it about, as if
they would try whether it is really Gold
or Air; whether there is no Magic, no
Necromancy in it or not; and I am
told of one to whom the Government
ow'd Ten Thou&s;and Crowns, which
he would have been glad to have &s;old
for Two Thou&s;and five Hundred, be|ing
an Arrear for Secret Service only,
that cau&s;ed an Iron Che&s;t to be bought,
and put the Money into it, then drove
Po&s;ts into the Ground in his Cellar,
and chain'd the Iron Che&s;t down to
the Stakes, then chain'd it al&s;o to the
Wall, and Barricadoed the Doors and
Window of the Cellar with Iron, and
all for fear, not of Thieves to Steal the
Money, but for fear the Money, Che&s;t
and all &s;hould fly away into the Air;
For he &s;aid he could never believe it
was Money. But to return to the Par|ticulars,
which I &s;ay have been done by
this Company, &s;ub&s;equent to this new
Arret of paying the publick Debts:
We have &s;een them &s;ince that do &s;trange

</LIST>
<P>I return to the Stock, and the pro|ceeding
of the Company: As the Advan|tages
of Publick bu&s;ine&s;s thus flow'd in,
the Credit of the Stock nece&s;&s;arily Ad|vanc'd;
and we were &s;urpriz'd in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
to find that every Po&s;t the Price
&s;tarted up whole Hundreds in a Day,
<PB N="64" REF="61">
till at length we &s;aw the Stock up at
1150 <HI>per Cent.</HI> 1200, and &s;ince that to
2050 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>Now was the Juncture of Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
to give the blow he had in View, the
multitude of People who came every
Hour to <HI>Paris,</HI> and run their Money
into the Stock, made his Project not
Rational only but Natural, <HI>(viz.)</HI>
That they might enlarge the Capital
Stock by Engrafting a farther Sub|&s;cription,
and that the New Sub&s;cribers
might have Encouragement to Sub|&s;cribe,
they &s;hould be allowed to Sub|&s;cribe
at 1000 Livres each, Original
Stock.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution, an Arre&s;t
was publi&s;hed, empowering the Com|pany
to take new Sub&s;criptions upon
the fir&s;t Foot of the Stock for 50 Mil|lions,
the Subcribers paying 10000
Livres each; and that I may explain
it as I go, you are to under&s;tand, that
for the Ten Thou&s;and Livres, the Sub-&s;cribers
has Credit in the Companies
Books for one Action or Share, that is
to &s;ay, for One Hundred Livres Origi|nal
Stock.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, it is ea&s;ie to
Calculate what the Company's Gain by
<PB N="65" REF="62">
by this new Sub&s;cription, but of that
in its Place: In the mean, time it is to
ob&s;erv'd, that &s;o eager were the People
to throng in their Money into the Stock,
that they were ready to tread one ano|ther
to death to get to the Books, and
it was the greate&s;t Favour in the
world to be admitted; &s;o that the
Books were not only fill'd up in about
Six Hours, but if there had been room
for Two Hundred Millions, it would
have been fill'd up at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Sub&s;cription de|clared
full, and no more hands to be
taken, but tho&s;e who could not get in
their Money, falls to work with tho&s;e
that had, and buy of them part of
what they had &s;ub&s;crib'd, and this
rais'd the Price &s;o, that the new Stock
ri&s;e immediately 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> even the
&s;ame day that it was &s;ub&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>As this had been clos'd with &s;o eager|ly,
and with &s;o much ardour by the
People, Mr. <HI>Laws,</HI> who knew very well
how to make his Advantage of the
Temper of the People, obtains a &s;e|cond
Order for 50 Millions more, and
in a Word had it fill'd with the &s;ame
eagerne&s;s and forwardne&s;s as before,
and after this a third of 50 Millions;
<PB N="66" REF="63">
the Arre&s;t of the&s;e Sub&s;criptions are
publick in our Papers, and will &s;hew
&s;omething of the Proof of what I have
affirm'd, of the forwardne&s;s of Sub|&s;cribers;
they are indeed too long to be
Copied here, neither is it of great u&s;e
to us to &s;ee the Form, which is only
what is u&s;ual in the Publick Acts on like
Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is now proper to Examine what
Immen&s;e Gain accrues to the Company
by the&s;e Sub&s;criptions, as al&s;o the Ori|ginal
Stock as then Advanc'd: I begin
with the Sub&s;criptions, which, as a|bove,
were taken in at a 1000 Livres
upon each 100 Livres Original Stock.</P>
<P>If then the Sub&s;cription was for Fifty
Millions Stock, at 100 Livres each Sub|&s;cription,
this advanc'd to a 1000 Li|vres,
each Stock amounts to no le&s;s
than 500 Millions of Livres; &s;o that
the Company receiving 1000 Millions
of Livres, for 50 Millions Original
Stock, advance, and are clear Gainers
by the Sub&s;cription no le&s;s than 450
Millions of Livres, and this doubled
by the &s;econd Sub&s;cription of 50 Milli|ons
make the Company's Gain amount
to 900 Millions of Livres, and that to
a third, it makes it 1350 Millions.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="64">
Add to this, the fir&s;t Stock of the
Company was much of it Sub&s;crib'd
by the Government it&s;elf, by the King,
by Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> as in the Company's
Name, and being &s;old &s;ince at 1000
and 1100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> has put, as I am
credibly inform'd, above 200 Millions
into their Pockets; be&s;ides what Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> is &s;aid to have Gain'd for his
private Account.</P>
<P>It will now be no longer a Wonder
how, and with what Coin the Compa|ny
&s;hould undertake to pay off 1500
Millions of Debt, or how they could
begin to pay, as was the Ca&s;e, Four
Months before the appointed Time,
for here is 1340 Millions Clearly gain'd,
<HI>Tout d'une Coup,</HI> at one blow, to go on
upon the payment with whenever they
pleas'd, be&s;ides what was to come;
and no body then doubted but that Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> would &s;et up a third Sub&s;cription;
but he found it convenient to &s;top here
for the pre&s;ent, and not only not to
take a farther Sub&s;cription, but to put
that out of doubt, he obtain'd a pub|lick
Arret declaring, that there &s;hould
be no new Sub&s;criptions granted.</P>
<P>But in this new Experiment Mr. <HI>Laws</HI>
found him&s;elf a little embarra&s;s'd, for
<PB N="68" REF="65">
there being &s;uch a run for their New
Sub&s;criptions, there were Con&s;equently
no Buyers, or fewer Buyers than be|fore
for the Old Stock, every one ha|ving,
as we &s;ay in <HI>England,</HI> a Penny
for a new Shop; neither was this all,
but as the new Sub&s;cribers paid but 100
Livres down upon their Sub&s;cription,
the re&s;t being allow'd to be paid in by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">qual payments in Nine Months, 100
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>per</HI> Month, it was with much
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;crib'd, becau&s;e they paid, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> 100 Livres for an Action,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> bought an Old one,
was oblig'd to pay 1000 Livres down,
this carried away the Buyers from the
old Stock; but this likewi&s;e was not all,
for tho&s;e who had a mind to &s;ub&s;cribe
to the New Stock, on purpo&s;e to Sell
out again, and Jobb them about, &s;old
out the Old Stock, becau&s;e for two Old
Actions, for which when &s;old the Sel|ler
receiv'd 2000 Livres, he might
with that Money Sub&s;cribe, or buy
Sub&s;criptions for 20 Shares or Actions
in the New; and laying down the fir&s;t
payment, get to <HI>Quinquampoix &s;treet,</HI>
the Exchange-Alley of <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;el|ling
them again at 1100 Livres each,
put 2000 Livres in his Pocket, and be
ju&s;t where he was.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="66">
The&s;e Things had their Influence
upon the Old Stock, and there being
abundance wanted to Sell, and few to
Buy, the Price fell at once, and indeed
began to fall &s;o Con&s;iderably, that
from 1250 it fell to 760, which was a
threatning Article; but Mr. <HI>Laws</HI> gave
a new Life to it all at once, for he per|ceiving
it, and knowing it would run
too fa&s;t for him to &s;top it if it was not
taken in time, applied an immediate
Remedy to it which could not fail to
an&s;wer his end, this was to publi&s;h,
and fix it up at the Door of the Bank,
and at other publick places of the City,
That the Company would take in all
the Old Shares that any Man was
willing to part with, at 900 Livres <HI>per</HI>
Share.</P>
<P>This was another Te&s;timony of the
Ma&s;terly Genius of Mr. <HI>Laws;</HI> for as
&s;oon as ever this publication was made
the Old Stock mounted again, and Sold
Currently for 1050 and 1030 or there|about,
no body coming, or but few to
&s;ell them.</P>
<P>Thus he warded off the blow: But
this was one Rea&s;on why he dur&s;t not
venture to form any additional Sub|&s;criptions,
and a good Rea&s;on too: But
<PB N="70" REF="67">
from this time forward, the Stock is
Grown up to a Prodigy of 2050 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> It is true it has &s;unk a little on
the approach of the time of Payment
for the fir&s;t Three Months, which is to
be paid in the fir&s;t of <HI>January, viz.</HI>
300 Livres <HI>per</HI> Share, and this for want
of Money has &s;unk the Stock to about
1850; but Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> that never wants
a Remedy for the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, imme|diately
calls a meeting of the Directors,
and agrees to declare a Dividend of Pro|fits
to amount to 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the
Stock, which tho' it be a Trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> on the
pre&s;ent advanc'd Price, yet was really
Con&s;iderable in it &s;elf, and amounts to
a very great Sum, no le&s;s than Six Mil|lions
and upwards: However 'tis agreed
that the Company have really gain'd
near 100 Millions Extraordinary, by
&s;elling her own Sub&s;criptions, and buy|ing
and &s;elling her own Stock; &s;o that
they may very ea&s;ily Divide 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
on the 1&s;t Stock, which would have been
1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the pre&s;ent Advance;
but of this hereafter. This is a brief
Account of the prodigious Ri&s;e and
Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Stock, and
of its pre&s;ent State and Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="68">
It remains to give &s;ome account of
its progre&s;s, and the &s;teps Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is
taking to e&s;tabli&s;h the Trade which it
has in View; for tho' indeed the Tra|ding
part has been the lea&s;t of Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s
de&s;ign, yet as it is the Denominating
quallity of the Company, and they are
called the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany,
he pu&s;hes this part al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Proceeding of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI>
part, is partly &s;een in the Arret of the
Council, mi&s;placed by mi&s;take, <HI>Pag.</HI> 31,
and which ought to have been placed
here: Wherein the Bank gives, or ra|ther
lends the Company 25 Millions in
Bank-Bills, for &s;mall Sums to be Cur|rent
in the Colony of <HI>Loui&s;ania</HI> or
<HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> and partly in the multitude
of People which are every Day all for
Planting &s;ent thither.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, we find
them launching out into a Prodigious
Trade that way, and &s;ending out about
Twenty Ships with Soldiers and va&s;t
Cargoes, to make Settlements, and place
Factories in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and all the
Twenty Ships to come Home Loden
with things proper for the Trade they
are upon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="69">
The&s;e are great things it mu&s;t be
confe&s;t, but as I have &s;aid, the&s;e are
not the chief end in View; Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s
aims are at Popularity, and keeping up
the Imaginary part which is rai&s;ed to
&s;uch a degree, as the Profit of Ten
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trades could not &s;upport,
and which never can be &s;upported with|out
&s;omething that can bring in a Pro|fit
equal to 3 or 4 <HI>per Cent per Annum,</HI>
upon the 2000 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which it &s;tands
advanc'd.</P>
<P>To bring this to pa&s;s, we find he does
every thing, and the Government in
his behalf does every thing that can
recommend them to the People, and
particularly acts of Generous Charity,
Publick Spirited Muneficence, taking
off the heavy Taxes upon the ordinary
Nece&s;&s;aries of Life and Convenience, by
which the Poor, who are more Senfible
of tho&s;e things, are touch'd, and en|gage
to Ble&s;s both the Per&s;on and the
Undertaking.</P>
<P>Innumerable Projects are in his Head
for publick good, he has already cau&s;ed
all the Turnpikes and Tole-bars at the
Entrance into the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI> to be
taken down; an innumerable number
of Collectors and Officers, that teiz'd
<PB N="73" REF="70">
the Poor for Money upon every Trifle
that enter the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

Coals or Wood, or Turff to Hay
or Oats, or Straw for Hor&s;es, Fle&s;h
or Fi&s;h, Herbs or Garden &s;tuff, and
Fruits or Wine to Drink; all things go
free into <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;o that the Families
live a fifth part cheaper than they did
before; the very Duty on Fi&s;h, which
is now aboli&s;hed, brought in to the
King two Millions a Year; but now
as the Rents of the Town-Hou&s;e of
<HI>Paris</HI> are Reimbur&s;ed, and they have
no more Annuities to pay, they have
likewi&s;e no Taxes to Levy, and all is
made free.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e things, which are the
Con&s;equence of paying the publick
Debts, he has new Projects of &s;o many
kinds, that it would require a large
Book to give an account of them.</P>
<P>He has undertaken a New Canal,
from the River <HI>Loyer</HI> to the <HI>Seine,</HI> to
bring more Water into the latter, by
the River <HI>Loyng,</HI> and an&s;werable to
the Canal <HI>de Briare,</HI> &s;o to bring Ve&s;&s;els
of large Burthens down tho&s;e Rivers,
and bring Wine and Brandy, and all
bulky Goods quite from <HI>Nants</HI> in <HI>Bre|taign,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="71">
and from the Sea, as well as from
the Inland Country about <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>He has lay'd a Scheme to Reduce the
River <HI>Seine</HI> to a narrower Channel be|tween
<HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> that &s;o the Chan|nel
may be Deepen'd and kept Clear,
by which means Ships of good Burthen
&s;hall come up even to <HI>Paris</HI> it &s;elf, and
to <HI>Roan,</HI> Ships of 400 Tuns Burthen
&s;hall come freely up to the Town Key.</P>
<P>He has de&s;ign'd to make <HI>Roan</HI> the
Capital of all <HI>France,</HI> for Commerce,
Navigation and Manufactures, all his
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> Tradede &s;hall be
carried on there, and the Magazines,
Warehou&s;es and places for Publick Sales,
&s;hall be fixt and built there; and as the
City of <HI>Roan</HI> it&s;elf is not &s;ufficient for
the Number of People that will be
drawn together by the&s;e things, and by
the Wollen Manufactures and Silk
Manufactures, which he de&s;igns to
&s;ettle there, He has projected, as Fame
reports, a New City on the other &s;ide
the <HI>Seine</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Roan,</HI> and a
Stone Bridge of a mo&s;t Magnificent
Structure, and which mu&s;t be prodi|gious
Strong, the Water there being
very deep and Rapid.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="72">
This Tract would be far too &s;hort to
